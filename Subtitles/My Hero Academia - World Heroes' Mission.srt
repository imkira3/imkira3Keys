00:00:33,673 --> 00:00:37,011
Why were superhuman
powers, the meta abilities

3
00:00:37,145 --> 00:00:42,549
known so casually as Quirks,
forced upon our kind?

4
00:00:42,682 --> 00:00:48,256
Why was the first met a human...
The Shining Baby... born unto us?

5
00:00:48,389 --> 00:00:52,559
These Quirks bring about
nothing but tragedy.

6
00:00:52,692 --> 00:00:54,694
They are not a blessing
on our world,

7
00:00:54,828 --> 00:00:58,899
but the beginning of its end.

8
00:00:59,033 --> 00:01:02,903
It is foretold in the
Quirk Doomsday Theory.

9
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:07,241
As generations pass,
powers mix and evolve.

10
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:12,146
Eventually, none will be able
to control their abilities.

11
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,381
In this hour of need,

12
00:01:13,514 --> 00:01:16,850
80 percent of humanity
is sick with Quirks.

13
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,819
How many of the
remaining pure humans

14
00:01:18,952 --> 00:01:21,289
will have relations
with Quirk holders?

15
00:01:21,422 --> 00:01:25,026
Spawning even more who are
cursed with this blight.

16
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:29,729
Our extinction is nigh at hand.

17
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:32,133
We, Humarise, must take action.

18
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:35,369
Even if it means dying
the earth red with blood,

19
00:01:35,503 --> 00:01:39,606
that will simply be our
righteous burden to bear.

20
00:01:40,674 --> 00:01:42,843
For humanity's salvation.

21
00:01:42,976 --> 00:01:45,446
For humanity's salvation.

22
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,249
For humanity's salvation.

23
00:01:48,382 --> 00:01:50,750
For humanity's salvation.

24
00:01:50,884 --> 00:01:55,755
For humanity's salvation.
For humanity's salvation.

25
00:01:55,889 --> 00:01:58,059
For humanity's salvation.

26
00:01:58,192 --> 00:01:59,192
Now then.

27
00:01:59,227 --> 00:02:01,195
Let us begin.

28
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,984
Ah, hello there.

29
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:33,820
It seems you don't have a Quirk.

30
00:03:33,954 --> 00:03:36,290
Congratulations.

31
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:39,926
You are one of the chosen
who's been saved.

32
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:58,355
The group
claiming responsibility

33
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,148
for the recent attack
is known as Humarise.

34
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,385
This radical sect was founded
by Flect Turn and seeks

35
00:04:04,518 --> 00:04:08,222
to save humanity from the
so-called Quirk Doomsday Theory.

36
00:04:08,356 --> 00:04:11,092
The attack used a
Quirk-activating substance

37
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:13,960
known as Ideotrigger that was
spread through the streets

38
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:17,298
via devices we're
dubbing Trigger Bombs.

39
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:22,279
The mission
of the Hero team we've gathered

40
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,072
is to search the 25
known Humarise complexes

41
00:04:25,206 --> 00:04:27,642
so that these bombs
can be destroyed.

42
00:04:27,774 --> 00:04:31,345
Intelligence suggests there's
one device at each location.

43
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:33,514
Arrest any Humarise
members present

44
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,449
and neutralize the payload.

45
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,519
Be advised you should
expect heavy resistance.

46
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:42,156
They may detonate the bombs
once they realize we're moving.

47
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,859
As such, we're not asking local
law enforcement to assist.

48
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:50,231
This is the most urgent mission
many of you have ever faced.

49
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:53,067
All Might.

50
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,969
Heroes, the success
or failure of this task

51
00:04:56,103 --> 00:04:58,706
rests on your shoulders.

52
00:04:58,838 --> 00:05:00,474
Let's give smiles
back to citizens

53
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,909
who're frightened by terrorism!

54
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,926
This is it, heroes.

55
00:05:20,061 --> 00:05:22,630
Start your missions!

56
00:05:22,763 --> 00:05:23,763
Team A.

57
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:25,099
No matter what happens,

58
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:27,144
collect the Trigger Bomb
before it can be set off!

59
00:05:27,168 --> 00:05:28,469
Roger that!

60
00:05:28,602 --> 00:05:31,472
There. Humarise's
Otheon headquarters.

61
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:33,517
While they handle
the weapon, we're to take

62
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,110
the facility and capture
their leader, Flect.

63
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:38,079
Don't let your
guards down, Team B.

64
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:40,448
What, you think
we'd forget all that?

65
00:05:40,581 --> 00:05:42,016
Shut up!

66
00:05:47,455 --> 00:05:48,955
Stay back!

67
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:50,534
We won't let you past us!

68
00:05:50,558 --> 00:05:52,278
This is what
resistance gets you.

69
00:05:52,326 --> 00:05:54,662
Clair. Track down the device.

70
00:05:54,795 --> 00:05:56,630
I'm on it.

71
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,232
Voyance!

72
00:06:01,901 --> 00:06:03,846
They're violating our sanctuary!

73
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,709
Bakugo, most of
their members are Quirkless!

74
00:06:08,843 --> 00:06:09,876
Don't be too rough.

75
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,612
Yeah. I know.

76
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,347
Stun Grenade!

77
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,387
Endeavor, there's
something wrong.

78
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:35,935
I can't find the bomb anywhere!

79
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,039
What's that? Where's Flect?

80
00:06:39,173 --> 00:06:40,741
We're about to close in on him.

81
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:42,076
Once he's captured,

82
00:06:42,209 --> 00:06:43,253
make him tell you
where the bomb is!

83
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,478
Roger!

84
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,081
Flect Turn is in that room.

85
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,022
Damn it! Their leader's gone!

86
00:06:55,156 --> 00:06:57,124
Search the premises!

87
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:04,231
In the end, even though
we raided the Humarise buildings

88
00:07:04,365 --> 00:07:09,437
around the world, we couldn't
find a single Trigger Bomb.

89
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,040
Yeah. We interrogated
the members we rounded up.

90
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:14,608
But it's no use.

91
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:16,844
They've got no clue where
the devices are being kept.

92
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:19,814
Doesn't seem like they even
knew the things existed.

93
00:07:19,946 --> 00:07:22,783
It's the same for members from
the other branches, too.

94
00:07:22,917 --> 00:07:25,519
My guess? It's likely
that the recent attack

95
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,055
was carried out by a
smaller internal group

96
00:07:28,189 --> 00:07:31,759
directly under the
control of Flect Turn.

97
00:07:31,892 --> 00:07:34,994
Director, there
might be another facility

98
00:07:35,129 --> 00:07:36,430
that we don't know about.

99
00:07:36,564 --> 00:07:38,466
They must have guessed
that we were coming

100
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,236
and moved the bombs
in anticipation.

101
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:45,339
All teams stand by in
your respective locations.

102
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:47,041
We're going to send
in more heroes

103
00:07:47,174 --> 00:07:49,677
to find Humarise's secret base!

104
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:56,116
I have to deliver this.

105
00:07:56,250 --> 00:08:00,120
If I don't, the world
will be destroyed!

106
00:09:42,023 --> 00:09:43,424
Roro. Lala.

107
00:09:43,557 --> 00:09:45,759
It's about time for me
to head off to work.

108
00:09:45,893 --> 00:09:46,927
You know what to do.

109
00:09:47,062 --> 00:09:50,397
We'll study bunches!

110
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:52,509
And if it turns out I'm not
gonna be home till late?

111
00:09:52,533 --> 00:09:55,369
We'll make dinner for ourselves!

112
00:09:55,502 --> 00:09:57,304
Mm. 'Kay, but...

113
00:09:57,438 --> 00:10:00,574
What if a weirdo shows up
and tries to stalk ya, huh?

114
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:03,410
We'll pretend nobody's home!

115
00:10:03,544 --> 00:10:04,745
Yeah?

116
00:10:04,878 --> 00:10:06,614
Yeah!

117
00:10:06,747 --> 00:10:08,349
Don't worry, though,
I doubt today's gig

118
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:09,526
is gonna take that long anyway.

119
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,518
Okay!

120
00:10:13,287 --> 00:10:15,456
Pino!

121
00:10:15,589 --> 00:10:18,258
All right, I'll catch
ya kiddos later.

122
00:10:18,392 --> 00:10:21,195
Have a good day!

123
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:44,318
Old man, you got a lead for me?

124
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:52,192
Pickup's on East Third Street.

125
00:10:52,326 --> 00:10:53,427
Be quick about it.

126
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,840
The package needs
to be delivered

127
00:10:54,928 --> 00:10:57,197
to the Chinese restaurant
in South Grove.

128
00:10:57,331 --> 00:10:58,799
How much cash are we talking?

129
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:02,569
Heh. Like you're in a position
to negotiate fees.

130
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:05,606
You'll take the regular rate
and do it with a smile.

131
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,709
Okay. I'm on it.

132
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:10,544
Done before you know it.

133
00:11:15,582 --> 00:11:17,152
What are you... that's my bike!

134
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,819
You stole it from someone else.

135
00:11:18,952 --> 00:11:22,090
I'll give it back to its
rightful owner later!

136
00:11:22,222 --> 00:11:25,325
You can't just take
whatever you want, damn punk!

137
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,594
C'mon. Let's get this over with.

138
00:11:39,074 --> 00:11:42,043
Whoa! The streets are so busy!

139
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,812
Yeah, well, I guess it is
the biggest city in Otheon.

140
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:48,749
Being told to wait
on standby is one thing.

141
00:11:48,882 --> 00:11:51,618
But since when do I get
treated like an errand boy?

142
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,122
It's because we're the lowest
ranking members in our group.

143
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:55,522
Huh?!

144
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:57,333
The only reason we got called up

145
00:11:57,357 --> 00:11:59,993
in the first place is because
we're doing our work studies

146
00:12:00,128 --> 00:12:01,395
at Endeavor's Agency.

147
00:12:01,528 --> 00:12:03,831
We're basically freebies
that were thrown in.

148
00:12:03,964 --> 00:12:06,567
Still. We have a huge
responsibility here.

149
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:09,303
Our job is to protect
the world from Humarise.

150
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:11,705
And we will find them.
We'll make sure of it.

151
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,942
The stupid organization
is full of obsessed idiots.

152
00:12:15,076 --> 00:12:17,911
Why do they believe the
Quirk Doomsday Theory?

153
00:12:18,046 --> 00:12:19,913
They're taking a
totally hypothetical idea

154
00:12:20,048 --> 00:12:23,450
and using it to
justify their crimes.

155
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:27,330
Those
thieves robbed my jewelry shop!

156
00:12:27,354 --> 00:12:29,224
Somebody stop them!

157
00:12:29,356 --> 00:12:30,357
Aw, hell. Heroes!

158
00:12:30,491 --> 00:12:31,759
Catch up with you at the spot.

159
00:12:31,892 --> 00:12:34,261
I'll leave the case to you!

160
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:36,131
You chase the other one!

161
00:12:36,263 --> 00:12:37,631
Got it!

162
00:12:37,765 --> 00:12:40,334
Move! Move!
Get outta my way now!

163
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:43,403
Black whip!

164
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:46,040
Todoroki! Stop him!

165
00:12:46,174 --> 00:12:47,474
Leave it to me!

166
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,085
That'll teach ya.

167
00:12:57,218 --> 00:12:59,053
What a pathetic blast!

168
00:13:00,454 --> 00:13:02,923
I'll show you what
a real one looks like!

169
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:13,667
This is taking too long.

170
00:13:13,801 --> 00:13:15,469
My contact better
not be a no-show.

171
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:19,907
Here!

172
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,543
Wait. What?

173
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:30,918
Not gonna work on me.

174
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:34,922
That took longer than expected.

175
00:13:36,557 --> 00:13:37,791
Todoroki!

176
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,960
Midoriya. The case is gone.

177
00:13:40,094 --> 00:13:41,695
Did he get rid of it?

178
00:13:46,267 --> 00:13:47,668
There's a third!

179
00:14:04,085 --> 00:14:05,619
Gotcha!

180
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,701
Stinks to be you.

181
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,475
He's already up on the roof?

182
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,814
I can't shake him.

183
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,154
Black whip!

184
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:48,929
Still got it.

185
00:14:52,532 --> 00:14:54,135
Hey, knock knock!

186
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:07,115
Oh, thank you so much!

187
00:15:07,248 --> 00:15:09,650
He couldn't have gotten
that far away yet, right?

188
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,587
Heh. I think it's pretty
obvious I'm too smooth for you.

189
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,257
You can't catch someone
with these moves.

190
00:15:48,022 --> 00:15:49,023
Huh?

191
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,327
Whoa!

192
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:53,694
Yikes!

193
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,930
An accident?

194
00:15:57,065 --> 00:15:59,145
Midoriya!
I'll take care of the car crash!

195
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,201
Thanks!

196
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,905
Hey. We're okay.

197
00:16:08,508 --> 00:16:09,708
Dang. I'm gonna be late.

198
00:16:13,914 --> 00:16:15,916
- ...- Wuh-oh!
- ...Wait!

199
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,359
Hold the door, will ya?

200
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:31,399
Man. Heck of a day, huh?

201
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,833
Aw, jeez.

202
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,345
This is my best set
of clothes, and now look,

203
00:16:34,369 --> 00:16:36,104
they're all scuffed up.

204
00:16:36,237 --> 00:16:37,405
That stupid hero.

205
00:16:37,537 --> 00:16:40,408
I should send him
a dry-cleaning bill.

206
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,775
Wait, have we seen him before?

207
00:16:41,908 --> 00:16:44,878
Is this town even
in his jurisdiction?

208
00:16:45,013 --> 00:16:46,080
Oh, well.

209
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,734
Don't have to worry
about him now, huh?

210
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,329
Why exactly did you
chase me down?

211
00:17:01,462 --> 00:17:02,929
Why were you running from me?

212
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:05,433
I have work to do,
so I was in a hurry.

213
00:17:05,565 --> 00:17:06,700
What kind of work?

214
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,702
I move money. Know what I mean?

215
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:10,971
I may not look it, but I'm
a skilled negotiator.

216
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,175
So, will you please let me
get along with my business?

217
00:17:14,308 --> 00:17:15,876
Okay, kid, thanks.

218
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:20,314
So show me what's in the case,
and then you're free to go.

219
00:17:20,448 --> 00:17:22,250
How much are you offering me?

220
00:17:22,383 --> 00:17:23,984
Huh?

221
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:27,155
Y'ask for somethin', it's only
natural you should pay for it.

222
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:29,157
I just wanna make sure
it's not stolen goods.

223
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:33,294
Say, you're not a hero
from this country, are you?

224
00:17:34,228 --> 00:17:36,963
Is it really okay for you to do
hero work in a foreign land

225
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,299
if you don't have permission?

226
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,800
Well... The thing is...

227
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,701
You've got no authority
in this city,

228
00:17:41,835 --> 00:17:43,804
so maybe rethink
your tone, my friend.

229
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,897
Or should I tell the police
that I was chased down

230
00:17:46,007 --> 00:17:47,808
and harassed by
a power-hungry hero

231
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,810
who had no legal
right to detain me?

232
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,779
How do you think that's
gonna go over, buddy?

233
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:56,917
I'm so glad we could come
to this understanding.

234
00:17:57,051 --> 00:17:58,419
If you wanna do pro work,

235
00:17:58,553 --> 00:18:01,422
I suggest you stay in your
own country from now on.

236
00:18:01,556 --> 00:18:02,556
Later.

237
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:03,957
Wait!

238
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:06,960
What's your problem?

239
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:08,095
I told you.

240
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:10,031
I wanna see what's in the case.

241
00:18:10,164 --> 00:18:12,333
If you want to see,
then flash some cash.

242
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,901
Show me and maybe I will.

243
00:18:15,036 --> 00:18:17,405
Show me 100,000 eurus.

244
00:18:17,538 --> 00:18:18,905
You're out of your mind.

245
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:23,578
...A quick peek!
...Just let go 'a me!

246
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,710
Hands off!

247
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:36,823
Huh?

248
00:18:38,259 --> 00:18:40,194
I'm... confused.

249
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,467
Good work.

250
00:18:46,601 --> 00:18:49,237
Hey, come over here for a sec!

251
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:50,937
Take a look at these.

252
00:18:51,072 --> 00:18:52,873
Where'd they come from?

253
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,042
Was this an attack?

254
00:19:11,925 --> 00:19:14,995
Unfortunate. But so be it.

255
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,031
We'll take the
necessary precautions.

256
00:19:17,165 --> 00:19:19,100
You shall continue
tracking it down.

257
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,068
Of course. Thank you, sir.

258
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,936
Don't forget, Beros.

259
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,838
There is only one way
for those possessed

260
00:19:24,971 --> 00:19:28,142
by the demon of sickness
to atone, and that is

261
00:19:28,276 --> 00:19:32,013
to give oneself to the cause
of saving humanity.

262
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:33,980
I understand.

263
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,984
I'm sorry!

264
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,454
Please forgive me, I beg of you!

265
00:19:40,588 --> 00:19:45,359
Jeez! So much for
avoiding any kind of scene.

266
00:19:45,493 --> 00:19:47,037
Well, I'm just glad
that you don't think

267
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,197
I'm a criminal anymore.
We're good here.

268
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,964
I guess even heroes
make mistakes

269
00:19:51,098 --> 00:19:53,134
and chase after innocent
people on occasion.

270
00:19:53,267 --> 00:19:54,868
Ah, crap, what's going on?

271
00:19:55,002 --> 00:19:56,404
This isn't what I signed up for.

272
00:19:56,537 --> 00:19:59,739
Wasn't this supposed
to be full of jewelry?

273
00:19:59,873 --> 00:20:00,873
Oh, no.

274
00:20:00,907 --> 00:20:02,410
Don't tell me...

275
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:07,315
I mixed up the cases?

276
00:20:10,518 --> 00:20:13,221
Anyway, like I said, super busy.

277
00:20:13,354 --> 00:20:16,123
You're really sweaty.
Do you feel okay?

278
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:18,559
Shoot, I need to
hurry up and backtrack.

279
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:20,595
But will the case
still be there?

280
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:22,963
If someone picked it up and
looked at what was inside,

281
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:25,099
there's no way
I'm getting it back.

282
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:26,701
I'm dealing with villains here.

283
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:29,537
I can't say, "Oopsy, I lost it."

284
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,538
This is bad.

285
00:20:30,671 --> 00:20:31,838
What am I gonna do?

286
00:20:31,972 --> 00:20:33,474
...'Scuse me.

287
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,576
Are you positive that
nothing's wrong with you?

288
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,877
Huh? Oh, I'm peachy thanks.

289
00:20:38,012 --> 00:20:40,314
...Okay then.

290
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,952
The police? Already?

291
00:20:46,087 --> 00:20:48,089
How'd they know to nab me?

292
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:52,460
Hands up and
kneel on the ground.

293
00:20:53,594 --> 00:20:55,162
Um. Hey, guys!

294
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:57,031
Please just hold on!
It's not him.

295
00:20:57,164 --> 00:20:58,633
Truth, didn't steal anything!

296
00:20:58,765 --> 00:20:59,809
Stop there!

297
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,168
We have permission to shoot!

298
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,403
Fire!

299
00:21:04,705 --> 00:21:06,873
Hang on and try not to flail.

300
00:21:45,379 --> 00:21:49,583
Why would they be using
lethal force on you?

301
00:21:49,717 --> 00:21:52,520
I thought that I was gonna die.

302
00:22:05,832 --> 00:22:07,335
Someone's after us?

303
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,987
We can't put
bystanders in danger.

304
00:22:28,122 --> 00:22:30,257
What's happening?!

305
00:22:44,805 --> 00:22:46,073
No!

306
00:22:58,119 --> 00:23:00,354
We have to get somewhere safe.

307
00:23:11,998 --> 00:23:13,667
Idiots!

308
00:23:13,801 --> 00:23:16,237
We're right in the middle
of an important mission.

309
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:17,681
You should leave
the petty criminals

310
00:23:17,705 --> 00:23:19,939
for the local authorities
to take care of!

311
00:23:20,074 --> 00:23:22,543
I thought heroes were supposed
to assist those in trouble.

312
00:23:22,676 --> 00:23:24,645
You're the one who's
supposed to be teaching us.

313
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,148
Maybe you should a explained
how to ignore crimes.

314
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,050
That's not what I said!

315
00:23:30,184 --> 00:23:32,353
And Deku? Where'd he run off to?

316
00:23:32,486 --> 00:23:35,156
He's following someone who was
working with the jewel thieves.

317
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,558
But he's not picking up
his phone right now.

318
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:38,826
You slackers!

319
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,337
I shouldn't have
brought you with me

320
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:42,062
even if you are doing
your work studies!

321
00:23:42,196 --> 00:23:43,497
It's him.

322
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:46,333
Midoriya, hey. Do you
have the suspect?

323
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,245
Police just attacked
us out of nowhere!

324
00:23:48,269 --> 00:23:49,269
What?

325
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:50,871
Why, what did you do to them?

326
00:23:51,005 --> 00:23:53,240
I don't know! They
barely said anything at all

327
00:23:53,374 --> 00:23:54,842
before they started
firing at us!

328
00:23:54,974 --> 00:23:57,244
And when we tried to run away,
we were attacked again

329
00:23:57,378 --> 00:23:58,488
by someone who
looked like a villain.

330
00:23:58,512 --> 00:23:59,847
Calm down!

331
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:01,649
Tell me everything
that happened.

332
00:24:01,782 --> 00:24:03,384
Start from the beginning.

333
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:05,952
Okay, so, I chased the
guy who ran away with the case

334
00:24:06,086 --> 00:24:07,655
and eventually caught him.

335
00:24:07,788 --> 00:24:10,090
But there wasn't any jewelry
inside when I opened it up.

336
00:24:10,224 --> 00:24:12,893
...Endeavor. Emergency.

337
00:24:13,027 --> 00:24:14,328
It's about Deku.

338
00:24:14,462 --> 00:24:15,862
Once again, according

339
00:24:15,962 --> 00:24:17,631
to recent police reports,

340
00:24:17,765 --> 00:24:20,100
the suspect, who is thought
to have killed 12 people,

341
00:24:20,234 --> 00:24:21,834
is at large and
considered by authorities

342
00:24:21,902 --> 00:24:24,505
to be highly dangerous.
He's a Japanese hero.

343
00:24:24,638 --> 00:24:27,308
Uh, called Deku.
Real name, Izuku Midoriya.

344
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:29,210
The entire nation
is on the lookout.

345
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:31,343
There are also reports
that he has an accomplice...

346
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:35,249
Hello? Hello? Todoroki?

347
00:24:35,382 --> 00:24:37,885
Midoriya. What did you
really do out there?

348
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,753
What do you mean? Nothing!

349
00:24:39,887 --> 00:24:41,455
The news.

350
00:24:41,589 --> 00:24:45,059
They're saying you're wanted as
a suspect for mass murder.

351
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,161
No.
That makes no sense.

352
00:24:47,294 --> 00:24:48,562
What's going on?

353
00:24:48,696 --> 00:24:50,364
We'll look into it on our end.

354
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:52,399
You stay off the grid for now.

355
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:55,302
They'll track you with GPS.
Once you turn off your phone,

356
00:24:55,436 --> 00:24:57,404
don't forget to take
out the battery.

357
00:24:58,272 --> 00:24:59,673
Ugh, don't do that!

358
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:02,610
So, you were able to get
in touch with your friends?

359
00:25:03,577 --> 00:25:05,513
Wait, what are you
doing to your phone?

360
00:25:05,646 --> 00:25:07,848
Did they say when
they're gonna pick us up?

361
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,351
Yeah. About that.

362
00:25:12,786 --> 00:25:15,089
We're getting an emergency call
from the Otheon team!

363
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,590
Deku's been put on
the wanted list!

364
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:20,127
What did Young Midoriya do?

365
00:25:20,261 --> 00:25:21,962
How could this have happened?

366
00:25:22,096 --> 00:25:23,340
I don't know,
but according to this,

367
00:25:23,364 --> 00:25:25,366
he killed 12
civilians in Otheon.

368
00:25:25,499 --> 00:25:27,568
What kind of ridiculous
lie is that?!

369
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,070
But this intel comes from HQ.

370
00:25:30,204 --> 00:25:31,472
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

371
00:25:31,605 --> 00:25:33,807
There's no way Midoriya
would ever hurt anybody!

372
00:25:33,941 --> 00:25:34,675
Guys?

373
00:25:34,808 --> 00:25:35,976
No, not a chance.

374
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:37,678
This must be some kinda mistake.

375
00:25:37,811 --> 00:25:39,747
It's a false report!

376
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,883
I can't believe it.
No way that's true.

377
00:25:43,018 --> 00:25:44,685
Deku fights to save people.

378
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:46,720
Something else must
be going on here!

379
00:25:46,854 --> 00:25:51,026
Ribbit! I'm sure there's an
explanation behind all this.

380
00:25:51,158 --> 00:25:52,593
I wouldn't worry, girls.

381
00:25:52,726 --> 00:25:55,229
Endeavor and the
others are on it.

382
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,037
Tell me I'm still unconscious.

383
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:03,370
You're a stone-cold murderer,

384
00:26:03,504 --> 00:26:04,939
and they think
I'm your accomplice?

385
00:26:05,072 --> 00:26:07,032
I thought you were supposed
to be some kinda hero!

386
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:09,243
Explain yourself!

387
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:11,979
I don't know how
we ended up like this.

388
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,881
I can't wrap my head
around all of it.

389
00:26:14,015 --> 00:26:16,650
Oh, great. It's all over.

390
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:18,019
Bye-bye life.

391
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:21,488
And here I thought I was
already living at rock-bottom.

392
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,724
What happens if I
fall even lower?

393
00:26:23,857 --> 00:26:25,626
Is it even possible?

394
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:28,195
This is all your fault!
You dragged me into this mess!

395
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,330
So fix it!

396
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:32,266
That's what heroes do, right?

397
00:26:33,901 --> 00:26:36,270
The police fired on us
without asking any questions,

398
00:26:36,403 --> 00:26:38,405
and then we were
attacked by a villain.

399
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,107
That tells me that
whoever's behind this

400
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,409
doesn't care if
we're dead or alive.

401
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:45,846
I would suspect they're
not really after us.

402
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:49,149
Ah! They must want this!

403
00:26:50,117 --> 00:26:51,685
I don't get it.

404
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,688
There's nothing in here that
looks incriminating, is there?

405
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,690
Wait, what are you doing?

406
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:59,126
You figure they're after
this dumb case, right?

407
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,661
That's perfect.

408
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:02,714
We'll hand it over and
this'll all be put to bed.

409
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,830
It's simple as that.

410
00:27:03,864 --> 00:27:05,399
Life will just go
back to normal.

411
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:07,468
No way, it can't be that easy.

412
00:27:07,601 --> 00:27:09,746
If what's in here is so
important, then they'd probably

413
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:13,140
wanna silence us even if
we did turn it in to them.

414
00:27:13,273 --> 00:27:14,375
Hey, don't say that!

415
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,876
We're never gonna get anywhere

416
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:17,654
if you're only thinking
negative thoughts, buddy.

417
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,680
So new plan.
Let's destroy the case.

418
00:27:19,813 --> 00:27:21,982
Then we can just say
"Whoops, it burned up."

419
00:27:22,117 --> 00:27:24,052
That's not gonna
fix our problems.

420
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,886
Uh. New-new plan.

421
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,321
What if we contact the police?

422
00:27:27,454 --> 00:27:29,289
Huh? And say what?

423
00:27:29,423 --> 00:27:30,658
"If you want the case,

424
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:32,893
then give us 1,000,000
eurus, pronto!"

425
00:27:33,028 --> 00:27:35,329
That would
make us real criminals!

426
00:27:35,462 --> 00:27:37,431
We need to calm down.

427
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,236
Are you sure we
can't ditch it somewhere?

428
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:44,338
They won't really
kill us, right?

429
00:27:44,471 --> 00:27:46,540
You're over thinking things.

430
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:49,977
If this case is related
to some sort of crime,

431
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:51,578
we can't give it
to the bad guys.

432
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:54,115
We might accidentally be
helping out real villains.

433
00:27:54,248 --> 00:27:57,785
Don't get me involved with
your hero sense of justice!

434
00:27:57,918 --> 00:28:00,721
I'm afraid we're
already in this together.

435
00:28:01,955 --> 00:28:03,490
They wanted to kill us.

436
00:28:03,624 --> 00:28:04,901
If we don't know the reason why,

437
00:28:04,925 --> 00:28:06,994
then it's dangerous
to act rashly.

438
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:11,498
Otherwise we'll end up
full of arrows. Or worse.

439
00:28:11,632 --> 00:28:16,637
Okay. Then what do
you suggest instead?

440
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,739
We run for it.

441
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:19,940
Huh?

442
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:23,310
No matter what
the situation may be,

443
00:28:23,444 --> 00:28:25,913
we can't fight
against the police.

444
00:28:26,047 --> 00:28:29,017
The people chasing us
are Otheon officers.

445
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:31,885
If we cross the border into the
neighboring country of Klayd,

446
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:35,856
then they shouldn't
be able to follow us.

447
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:39,426
Let's hurry and get out of here
before we end up trapped.

448
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,228
What about the arrow person?

449
00:28:41,361 --> 00:28:43,731
A border's not gonna
stop a villain.

450
00:28:43,864 --> 00:28:47,634
If that happens, then I promise
that I'll protect you from them.

451
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:48,769
Huh?

452
00:28:48,902 --> 00:28:50,181
I think getting out of here

453
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:52,140
is our best course of action.

454
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,843
Okay, fine, I guess that plan
makes as much sense as anything.

455
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:59,013
I'll go to Klayd or
wherever you think is best.

456
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:01,216
Right.

457
00:29:01,348 --> 00:29:02,683
That bus'll get us
to the border.

458
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:04,685
And it'll be free
if we hop on top.

459
00:29:04,818 --> 00:29:06,987
Absolutely not! We have
to pay if we ride.

460
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:08,756
We're wanted bad guys, remember?

461
00:29:08,889 --> 00:29:11,725
It'll be over if
somebody recognizes us.

462
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:15,662
Aw, man.

463
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:21,335
See? A freebie's not so bad.

464
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:25,339
The delinquent life grows
on you. You'll see, hero.

465
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:28,475
Delaware Smash. Air Force!

466
00:29:33,114 --> 00:29:35,482
I just paid for two seats.

467
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,187
And yet I get the feeling
we're staying on the roof.

468
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,388
Well, yeah.

469
00:29:44,259 --> 00:29:45,425
That's nonsense!

470
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,128
What evidence is there
to support that?

471
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:51,032
Explain everything you have
on Deku, Commissioner General.

472
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:53,934
The case against Izuku
Midoriya is still pending.

473
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:57,138
I'm afraid I can't discuss any
of the finer details with you.

474
00:29:57,272 --> 00:29:59,640
Especially considering
you're his current boss

475
00:29:59,773 --> 00:30:00,908
and fellow countryman.

476
00:30:01,042 --> 00:30:02,543
Tch.

477
00:30:07,447 --> 00:30:08,658
Endeavor.

478
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:11,286
Japan's number-one hero.

479
00:30:11,418 --> 00:30:14,855
He's gravely afflicted
with Stage Five.

480
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:19,359
For humanity's salvation.

481
00:30:20,727 --> 00:30:22,263
Shoto!

482
00:30:22,396 --> 00:30:24,965
I just got this report back
from a detective friend of mine.

483
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:26,667
What does it say?

484
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,004
It appears the car you
saw was attacked by a Quirk.

485
00:30:30,138 --> 00:30:31,471
The strange thing is,

486
00:30:31,605 --> 00:30:33,540
the driver was a
member of Humarise.

487
00:30:33,674 --> 00:30:36,010
Wait, Humarise?

488
00:30:36,144 --> 00:30:37,945
Well, did he survive
the accident?

489
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:41,015
He's comatose,
in critical condition.

490
00:30:41,149 --> 00:30:44,618
Police are standing watch
outside his room in the ICU.

491
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,653
So we can't interrogate him yet.

492
00:30:46,787 --> 00:30:49,157
And there's one
other thing, too.

493
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:51,892
It looks like the stolen
jewelry was left scattered

494
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:53,493
nearby the scene.

495
00:30:53,627 --> 00:30:55,063
Huh? But why?

496
00:30:57,531 --> 00:30:59,300
It's a message from Midoriya.

497
00:30:59,433 --> 00:31:00,834
What does he say?

498
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,712
"Keep eating
lunch with strawberries

499
00:31:02,736 --> 00:31:04,816
and make sure you eat the
dinner in the fridge, too."

500
00:31:04,872 --> 00:31:06,307
Why is he telling me
what to eat?

501
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
This is odd.

502
00:31:07,507 --> 00:31:09,977
This must be some kind of code.

503
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:11,745
Clever.

504
00:31:11,879 --> 00:31:15,016
K-L-A-Y-D.

505
00:31:15,149 --> 00:31:16,483
What does this mean?

506
00:31:16,617 --> 00:31:19,419
Did he flee to the neighboring
country of Klayd?

507
00:31:19,553 --> 00:31:22,489
If not yet, he must
be heading there.

508
00:31:22,623 --> 00:31:23,824
Which means I'm going, too.

509
00:31:23,957 --> 00:31:26,593
All right, then.
I'll update Endeavor.

510
00:31:27,861 --> 00:31:29,039
Bakugo, come with me.

511
00:31:29,063 --> 00:31:30,864
Get your hands off me!

512
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,435
It's about Deku, huh?

513
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:37,771
I'll explain later.

514
00:31:39,406 --> 00:31:40,674
First, let's lose the police.

515
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:42,743
Don't order me around!

516
00:31:47,181 --> 00:31:51,085
I hope Todoroki and
the others figure out my code.

517
00:31:51,219 --> 00:31:54,122
What secret is hidden
inside this case?

518
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:04,631
Looks deserted.
No police around.

519
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,900
Hey, uh...

520
00:32:07,035 --> 00:32:08,915
Do you mind if I run and
make a call real quick?

521
00:32:09,037 --> 00:32:10,338
Oh. Sure.

522
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,110
They didn't have anything
about you on TV,

523
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,275
so you should be okay
to show your face.

524
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:16,010
Try to make it short, though.

525
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:17,444
Got it.

526
00:32:22,616 --> 00:32:23,917
Stanleyk here.

527
00:32:24,052 --> 00:32:25,052
Yo. Old man.

528
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,920
Hm? Is that you, Rody?

529
00:32:27,055 --> 00:32:29,357
Yeah, sorry to call
ya out of the blue,

530
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,867
but can you swing
by my house and tell

531
00:32:30,891 --> 00:32:32,011
my little brother and sister

532
00:32:32,126 --> 00:32:34,561
that I won't be
home for a while?

533
00:32:34,695 --> 00:32:36,264
I'll pay you later. Promise.

534
00:32:36,397 --> 00:32:38,433
You idiot!

535
00:32:38,565 --> 00:32:41,135
I have no obligation
to do you favors!

536
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:42,803
And besides.

537
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:44,747
I got a complaint saying the
big delivery was never made!

538
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:45,771
Things went south.

539
00:32:45,872 --> 00:32:46,873
No excuses!

540
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,343
It's not my fault!

541
00:32:48,475 --> 00:32:49,852
If you don't want to die,

542
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:51,596
then hurry up and
deliver the goods! Got it?

543
00:32:54,048 --> 00:32:57,484
I don't have the goods.

544
00:32:59,486 --> 00:33:01,788
Damn it!

545
00:33:01,922 --> 00:33:03,724
Hey, is everything okay?

546
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:07,894
Heh, oh, yeah,
life couldn't be any better.

547
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:10,731
Huh.

548
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,504
So, you think that the
cases got switched?

549
00:33:12,632 --> 00:33:16,603
Yes. The jewelry
store was robbed by a villain.

550
00:33:16,737 --> 00:33:18,577
But Midoriya thinks that
there was some kind of

551
00:33:18,638 --> 00:33:20,408
mix-up on the street.

552
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:24,145
So the one he has now used
to belong to a Humarise member.

553
00:33:24,278 --> 00:33:25,879
No jewelry.

554
00:33:26,014 --> 00:33:29,050
And that's probably the reason
the police are chasing him.

555
00:33:29,183 --> 00:33:29,916
Moron.

556
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:31,818
Possibly.

557
00:33:31,952 --> 00:33:34,921
I'm guessing, whatever he's
carrying around is important.

558
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:37,158
Question is, why are
the police mobilizing

559
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:38,892
on such a large scale?

560
00:33:39,027 --> 00:33:42,196
Humarise members have
infiltrated the police force.

561
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:43,164
Yeah.

562
00:33:43,297 --> 00:33:44,598
And there's no telling

563
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,501
when they'll make their
allegiances known.

564
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:47,801
We have to be careful.

565
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:49,770
I'll do what I want!

566
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,211
That's not great.

567
00:33:57,345 --> 00:33:59,555
Doesn't look like anything's
crossing the border from here.

568
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,483
We'll have to borrow a vehicle
of some sort tomorrow.

569
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:04,718
Otherwise, we'll
be stuck walking.

570
00:34:04,851 --> 00:34:06,820
Walking? You're crazy.

571
00:34:06,953 --> 00:34:08,855
Did you forget how
heavy this thing is?

572
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:12,026
If you get tired, I can
just carry you on my back.

573
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:14,262
After all, that's what
strength is for, right?

574
00:34:14,395 --> 00:34:18,032
Helping people out
whenever they're in trouble.

575
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:21,035
Heh. Maybe fix our
current situation

576
00:34:21,169 --> 00:34:24,439
rather than treating
me like a backpack.

577
00:34:24,571 --> 00:34:26,706
Oh, I will. I promise.

578
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,025
Time for takeoff!

579
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,663
Let me, Big Brother!

580
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,765
Here you go.

581
00:34:54,135 --> 00:34:55,135
You're so lucky!

582
00:34:55,169 --> 00:34:56,169
Lift me up next!

583
00:34:56,204 --> 00:34:58,306
Then me!

584
00:34:58,439 --> 00:35:01,275
Wow, Rody!

585
00:35:01,409 --> 00:35:02,676
Dad!

586
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,512
Welcome back!

587
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:06,680
Hey there, kiddos.

588
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:24,232
What's the deal? Why is the
puzzle you brought home so hard?

589
00:35:24,365 --> 00:35:26,300
How am I supposed
to solve this thing?

590
00:35:26,434 --> 00:35:29,237
I'll help, but I'm only
giving you one hint.

591
00:35:39,946 --> 00:35:41,706
You should be able to
figure it out from here

592
00:35:41,815 --> 00:35:44,485
if you keep trying.

593
00:35:50,558 --> 00:35:52,126
Dad. This is yours.

594
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,494
It's a present.

595
00:35:55,229 --> 00:35:57,174
Thanks for always
taking care of Roro and Lala.

596
00:35:57,198 --> 00:35:59,233
You're a good brother, Rody.

597
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,475
I heard the
father abandoned them.

598
00:36:07,608 --> 00:36:11,345
It's worse.
He became a member of Humarise.

599
00:36:11,479 --> 00:36:13,914
That group who
thinks Quirks are a sickness?

600
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:16,050
Ugh, they're whack jobs.

601
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:18,486
They were behind
that incident the other day.

602
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:21,022
Wasn't the dad
a famous engineer, though?

603
00:36:21,155 --> 00:36:23,424
I never would have
seen this coming.

604
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:26,260
Kids, I don't want
you to play with them anymore.

605
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:28,529
Who knows what they might
have picked up from him?

606
00:36:28,663 --> 00:36:29,796
Okay.

607
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,973
Let's go to the park!

608
00:36:30,997 --> 00:36:32,732
Yeah!

609
00:36:38,439 --> 00:36:40,974
...Big Brother
...Brother

610
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:42,108
We'll be fine.

611
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,378
I'll always stay with you, okay?

612
00:36:44,512 --> 00:36:47,348
You never have to worry
about me leaving.

613
00:37:09,803 --> 00:37:11,972
If this case is related
to some sort of crime,

614
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:13,574
we can't give it
to the bad guys.

615
00:37:13,708 --> 00:37:16,410
We might accidentally be
helping out real villains.

616
00:37:30,824 --> 00:37:32,293
Hello?

617
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,369
What's happening?

618
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:48,642
No. He wouldn't.

619
00:38:02,189 --> 00:38:04,058
Are you with the police?

620
00:38:04,191 --> 00:38:06,327
Hand over the package.

621
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:12,299
So yeah.

622
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,536
This means I'm free
to bounce, right?

623
00:38:17,937 --> 00:38:19,806
Where's your friend?

624
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,344
You both know, don't you?

625
00:38:24,578 --> 00:38:26,023
You must've figured out by now

626
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:29,250
the reason we're
after the briefcase.

627
00:38:29,383 --> 00:38:33,454
No, no I swear.
We haven't got a clue!

628
00:38:35,423 --> 00:38:37,991
Please, my brother and
sister need me back.

629
00:38:38,125 --> 00:38:41,429
They're only kids.
You have to let me go home!

630
00:38:46,933 --> 00:38:48,536
Air Force first.

631
00:38:48,669 --> 00:38:51,539
Then... Smash!

632
00:38:59,513 --> 00:39:01,282
I... I'm so sorry!

633
00:39:08,988 --> 00:39:10,957
Smash!

634
00:39:15,262 --> 00:39:16,930
Why did you do that?

635
00:39:17,064 --> 00:39:19,400
I need you to hold on
to me tightly.

636
00:39:23,137 --> 00:39:24,904
Damn it!

637
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,880
Wait here, okay?

638
00:39:34,014 --> 00:39:35,258
I'll find a doctor
or somebody quick.

639
00:39:35,282 --> 00:39:36,784
No. It's not that deep.

640
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,019
I'll be fine, don't worry.

641
00:39:39,153 --> 00:39:41,389
It destroyed my phone, though.

642
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,159
You mind?

643
00:39:45,292 --> 00:39:47,704
I think there's a first aid kit
floating around in my backpack.

644
00:39:47,728 --> 00:39:49,497
Oh. Yeah.

645
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:52,099
That archer is a
tough one for sure.

646
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:53,534
Once I'm patched up,

647
00:39:53,667 --> 00:39:55,603
we're gonna need to find
another place to hide.

648
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:11,752
Why did you take
the arrow back there?

649
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:14,655
Huh? What are you asking?

650
00:40:18,992 --> 00:40:21,295
I betrayed you.
You know that.

651
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:23,664
I stole the case
while you slept.

652
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:25,599
Instead of worrying about me,

653
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:28,169
you could have grabbed
it and run away.

654
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:32,039
Uh... Why would I do
something like that?

655
00:40:32,173 --> 00:40:33,450
I was carrying the jewelry

656
00:40:33,474 --> 00:40:35,509
the villains stole
this afternoon.

657
00:40:35,643 --> 00:40:37,812
I'm one of those bad
guys you heroes hate

658
00:40:37,944 --> 00:40:39,447
and wanna throw in jail!

659
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,550
Well, I can't ignore
when someone's in trouble.

660
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:46,520
It's kind of my life's
dream to help people.

661
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:51,425
But why would a criminal like me
be worth getting hurt over?

662
00:40:51,559 --> 00:40:53,661
It's always worth it if
I'm able to help someone,

663
00:40:53,794 --> 00:40:55,529
no matter who it is.

664
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,035
I do not get you.

665
00:41:02,803 --> 00:41:06,373
That's why I admire heroes.

666
00:41:06,507 --> 00:41:09,243
I want to be someone
who can save people,

667
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:13,848
with a smile on my face
the whole time.

668
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:16,383
I want to be like All Might.

669
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,552
You're talking about
the blond one, yeah?

670
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:19,553
He's pretty famous.

671
00:41:19,687 --> 00:41:22,122
Uh-huh! He's my teacher.

672
00:41:22,256 --> 00:41:24,391
Seriously?

673
00:41:25,826 --> 00:41:28,562
So you wanted to become
just like All Might,

674
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:32,399
and you chased that dream until
it became a reality for you.

675
00:41:32,533 --> 00:41:35,903
Heh. You an' me couldn't
be any more different.

676
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:37,371
Huh?

677
00:41:37,505 --> 00:41:39,473
My future's pretty
set in stone already.

678
00:41:39,607 --> 00:41:41,675
I don't have the luxury
of saying nonsense like

679
00:41:41,809 --> 00:41:44,144
"I wanna be a pilot."

680
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:47,615
It's all I can do to provide
for my younger siblings.

681
00:41:47,748 --> 00:41:49,783
- ...- Well, maybe...
- ...Don't say a word.

682
00:41:49,917 --> 00:41:52,119
I don't want your pity!

683
00:41:57,992 --> 00:41:59,627
Stupid heroes.

684
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,730
I've always thought they were
people looking for attention,

685
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:06,500
who wanted to make money under
the guise of helping others.

686
00:42:07,535 --> 00:42:11,305
You see, pros never come
to the place where I live.

687
00:42:11,438 --> 00:42:13,774
They wouldn't make
any cash there.

688
00:42:16,777 --> 00:42:21,181
But... I guess there are
heroes like you around, too.

689
00:42:21,315 --> 00:42:23,717
The more you help me
and I get to know you,

690
00:42:23,851 --> 00:42:27,688
the more I wonder about what
I'm doing with my own life.

691
00:42:27,821 --> 00:42:31,058
Truth is, I'm pretty lame.

692
00:42:31,191 --> 00:42:34,094
I would say the
same about myself.

693
00:42:34,228 --> 00:42:35,863
I've wanted be
a pro hero forever,

694
00:42:35,996 --> 00:42:39,533
since I was just a little kid.
But I was too weak.

695
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:43,470
People kept telling me
my goals were impossible.

696
00:42:43,604 --> 00:42:46,007
I couldn't use my Quirk
properly at first,

697
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,942
and I was at the
bottom of my class.

698
00:42:48,075 --> 00:42:52,680
Even now, I'm always being
helped out by my classmates.

699
00:42:52,813 --> 00:42:54,481
I'm still weak.

700
00:42:54,615 --> 00:42:57,585
That's why I wanted
so badly to improve.

701
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,823
To become a hero
who saves people.

702
00:43:02,957 --> 00:43:05,159
And always with a smile.

703
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,172
Oh. Yeah. That's Pino.

704
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:19,305
Hi, Pino.

705
00:43:21,675 --> 00:43:24,979
Oh, and by the way.
The name's Rody Soul.

706
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:27,281
We sorta skipped intros.

707
00:43:29,283 --> 00:43:31,318
And my name's Izuku Midoriya,

708
00:43:31,452 --> 00:43:33,320
but call me my hero name, Deku.

709
00:43:33,454 --> 00:43:35,923
"Deku." That's easy to remember.

710
00:43:36,057 --> 00:43:37,324
Yeah. It's grown on me.

711
00:43:39,393 --> 00:43:41,362
Let's get some sleep, Rody.

712
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:43,731
Yeah. Good idea, Deku.

713
00:43:49,803 --> 00:43:51,739
I deeply apologize.

714
00:43:51,872 --> 00:43:54,341
They escaped before
we could neutralize them.

715
00:43:54,475 --> 00:43:56,844
The entirety of the police
force has been mobilized

716
00:43:56,977 --> 00:43:59,313
to seek out their location.

717
00:43:59,446 --> 00:44:01,649
Can't you get the army involved?

718
00:44:01,782 --> 00:44:02,816
I'm sorry, sir.

719
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,985
I'm afraid that's
beyond my jurisdiction.

720
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,587
Then continue with the search.

721
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,491
Of course. For the
salvation of humanity.

722
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,774
A villain?

723
00:44:32,312 --> 00:44:33,847
Rody?

724
00:44:33,981 --> 00:44:35,416
Sorry, did I wake ya?

725
00:44:35,549 --> 00:44:36,559
Where'd you get a truck?

726
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:37,751
I kinda borrowed it.

727
00:44:37,885 --> 00:44:40,187
Just figured we
were done walking.

728
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:44,191
Even wrote an IOU in the name
of the World Hero Association.

729
00:44:44,324 --> 00:44:46,560
They'll understand.

730
00:44:47,861 --> 00:44:50,230
Wish they'd had a Cessna,
we could've flown

731
00:44:50,364 --> 00:44:52,332
straight into Klayd
that way, no problem.

732
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:53,801
Like, an airplane?

733
00:44:53,934 --> 00:44:55,736
You can really fly
something like that?

734
00:44:55,869 --> 00:44:57,905
Only in my dreams, friend.

735
00:44:58,039 --> 00:44:59,406
Get in.

736
00:45:02,509 --> 00:45:03,510
Question.

737
00:45:03,644 --> 00:45:04,912
Yeah?

738
00:45:05,046 --> 00:45:06,589
Once we figure out
the case's secret,

739
00:45:06,613 --> 00:45:08,248
I can go home, right?

740
00:45:08,382 --> 00:45:10,751
That should be fine.

741
00:45:10,884 --> 00:45:13,554
Oh. I bet your younger brother's
waiting for you at home, huh?

742
00:45:13,687 --> 00:45:15,255
Yeah, with my sister.

743
00:45:15,389 --> 00:45:16,724
What about your parents?

744
00:45:16,857 --> 00:45:18,659
My mom died right after
she had my sister,

745
00:45:18,792 --> 00:45:20,961
so it was up to my dad
to take care of the kids.

746
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:23,064
He did a pretty good job
there for a while,

747
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:24,898
raising us while juggling work,

748
00:45:25,033 --> 00:45:28,235
then he suddenly up and
disappeared one day.

749
00:45:28,368 --> 00:45:29,703
Disappeared?

750
00:45:29,837 --> 00:45:32,573
Do you know about that
group called Humarise?

751
00:45:32,706 --> 00:45:35,176
I do. They're a
terrorist organization.

752
00:45:35,309 --> 00:45:37,444
Yeah. After people
in town found out

753
00:45:37,578 --> 00:45:39,080
that Dad left to
become a member,

754
00:45:39,214 --> 00:45:40,581
things got bad for my family.

755
00:45:40,714 --> 00:45:42,150
Our friends started ignoring us,

756
00:45:42,282 --> 00:45:44,360
we were kicked out of our
school and out of our house,

757
00:45:44,384 --> 00:45:47,988
and I couldn't find anyone who
would hire me for honest work.

758
00:45:48,123 --> 00:45:51,126
I'm sorry, that's awful.

759
00:45:51,258 --> 00:45:53,393
I obviously resented
my dad at first.

760
00:45:53,527 --> 00:45:55,629
But not so much anymore.

761
00:45:55,763 --> 00:45:57,865
I don't have time to
think twice about him.

762
00:45:57,998 --> 00:45:59,399
Now, my little
brother and sister

763
00:45:59,533 --> 00:46:00,968
are the most important
things to me.

764
00:46:01,102 --> 00:46:05,173
I just want to create a decent
future for those kiddos.

765
00:46:05,305 --> 00:46:07,908
Aw! They're so cute.

766
00:46:08,042 --> 00:46:10,211
My little brother's
stupid smart!

767
00:46:10,344 --> 00:46:13,847
And my sister's
totally adorable.

768
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:16,383
First person to break
her heart gets KO-d!

769
00:46:16,517 --> 00:46:19,686
Whoa! Keep
your eyes up, Rody!

770
00:48:54,708 --> 00:48:56,010
Dang.

771
00:48:56,144 --> 00:48:58,578
I can't get over how
useful your Quirk is.

772
00:48:58,712 --> 00:49:01,682
What about you? I mean,
do you have a Quirk?

773
00:49:01,815 --> 00:49:02,849
I've been wondering.

774
00:49:02,983 --> 00:49:05,286
I don't wanna talk about it.

775
00:49:05,420 --> 00:49:08,522
Oh. Sorry.

776
00:49:08,655 --> 00:49:10,391
You won't laugh, will you?

777
00:49:10,524 --> 00:49:11,692
I promise!

778
00:49:11,825 --> 00:49:12,993
Really?

779
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:14,895
No! I swear it!

780
00:49:16,697 --> 00:49:19,833
Okay. It's kinda weird.

781
00:49:32,046 --> 00:49:34,115
The path is heavily guarded.

782
00:49:34,248 --> 00:49:35,792
We're not gonna be able
to go this route

783
00:49:35,816 --> 00:49:37,751
without fighting
our way through.

784
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:43,091
Our only choice
is to scale these ridges.

785
00:49:47,128 --> 00:49:48,695
Get on my back. Hurry.

786
00:49:48,829 --> 00:49:50,998
Deku. Take this.

787
00:49:51,132 --> 00:49:52,166
What's the deal?

788
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,035
It'll be difficult
for you to carry me

789
00:49:54,168 --> 00:49:56,603
with that injury from the arrow.
This is where I say goodbye.

790
00:49:56,737 --> 00:49:58,939
Hold on. The truck's out of gas.

791
00:49:59,073 --> 00:50:01,009
I can't leave you alone
in a place like this.

792
00:50:01,142 --> 00:50:03,810
Come on. You know
how fast I can run in a pinch.

793
00:50:03,944 --> 00:50:06,813
I'll scrounge up some food.
Then I'll wait for you.

794
00:50:06,947 --> 00:50:08,682
You go figure out
what's up with this case.

795
00:50:08,815 --> 00:50:10,018
That's what we're here for.

796
00:50:10,151 --> 00:50:11,718
But, Rody.

797
00:50:11,852 --> 00:50:14,055
I'm counting on you, hero!

798
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:23,797
It's them!

799
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:32,672
I will not fail again!

800
00:50:37,677 --> 00:50:39,247
Use these.

801
00:50:48,156 --> 00:50:50,957
Ah, damn it. They're
gonna flatten us!

802
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:11,112
Delaware Smash.

803
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,348
Air Force kick!

804
00:51:24,591 --> 00:51:26,793
Rody! Are you okay?

805
00:51:26,927 --> 00:51:28,762
Yeah. Maybe.

806
00:51:29,763 --> 00:51:30,997
The case!

807
00:51:32,467 --> 00:51:33,467
Watch out!

808
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:43,111
Rody!

809
00:51:51,519 --> 00:51:53,820
Deku, catch it!

810
00:51:54,988 --> 00:51:56,591
I'm coming!

811
00:51:59,693 --> 00:52:04,198
For the salvation of humanity!

812
00:52:14,475 --> 00:52:17,411
Wait, is this Todoroki?

813
00:52:17,545 --> 00:52:18,979
You learned nothing from Hosu.

814
00:52:19,113 --> 00:52:21,382
Your codes are still
hard to decipher.

815
00:52:24,818 --> 00:52:26,887
Oh, don't even try it.

816
00:52:31,259 --> 00:52:34,028
Wait. Free me, I'll do
whatever you want.

817
00:52:34,162 --> 00:52:36,631
Tell me everything you know
and maybe I'll consider it.

818
00:52:36,763 --> 00:52:38,698
Fine, yeah. You got it!

819
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:45,206
Die, you traitor!

820
00:52:45,339 --> 00:52:47,575
Damn it.
Bakugo, take her down.

821
00:52:47,707 --> 00:52:49,910
Don't give me orders!

822
00:53:02,956 --> 00:53:04,134
We're out of control!

823
00:53:04,158 --> 00:53:06,427
Stand down and come quietly.

824
00:53:09,896 --> 00:53:12,366
For humanity's salvation.

825
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,409
All units get over there!

826
00:53:24,679 --> 00:53:26,080
Rody, are you all right?

827
00:53:26,214 --> 00:53:28,482
Yeah, but I'm not sure how.

828
00:53:28,616 --> 00:53:30,084
Where is it?

829
00:53:30,218 --> 00:53:32,786
Midoriya. I grabbed this.

830
00:53:32,919 --> 00:53:34,255
Thanks, Todoroki.

831
00:53:34,388 --> 00:53:36,023
But how did you find us?

832
00:53:36,157 --> 00:53:38,159
All thanks to their
flashy attacks.

833
00:53:38,292 --> 00:53:40,428
I spotted you from the train.

834
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:42,829
Is he the one you were
talking about on the phone?

835
00:53:42,963 --> 00:53:44,232
Yeah, that's right.

836
00:53:44,365 --> 00:53:46,400
He's been pegged as
a criminal, like me.

837
00:53:46,534 --> 00:53:48,102
His name is Rody Soul.

838
00:53:48,236 --> 00:53:50,171
Hey, thanks for the assist.

839
00:53:50,304 --> 00:53:51,472
More importantly...

840
00:53:51,606 --> 00:53:52,772
The damn case.

841
00:53:52,906 --> 00:53:54,442
It's somehow connected
to Humarise.

842
00:53:54,575 --> 00:53:56,943
What? Wait, are you
certain about that?

843
00:53:57,078 --> 00:53:59,913
Yes. Our goal was to
save both it and you.

844
00:54:00,047 --> 00:54:01,315
We thought it was possible

845
00:54:01,449 --> 00:54:04,118
we'd be able to get some
useful intelligence.

846
00:54:07,588 --> 00:54:09,590
What's the matter, Midoriya?

847
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:11,292
A compartment.

848
00:54:17,598 --> 00:54:20,334
What is this? How does it work?

849
00:54:22,836 --> 00:54:24,171
Try pressing it right here?

850
00:54:24,305 --> 00:54:26,674
That'll just make it go
back to how it was.

851
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:28,643
Hm. This is hard.

852
00:54:28,775 --> 00:54:30,077
Still not working.

853
00:54:30,211 --> 00:54:32,146
Ugh. Hand it over!
I'll blow it up!

854
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:35,915
What? No.
You can't do that, Kacchan.

855
00:54:36,050 --> 00:54:38,885
Deku, can I see
that for a second?

856
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,554
You know how to solve it?

857
00:54:40,688 --> 00:54:43,857
I did a puzzle like this
before when I was a kid.

858
00:54:44,858 --> 00:54:46,627
Let's see.

859
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:48,095
Like this.

860
00:54:48,229 --> 00:54:48,962
And this.

861
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:51,532
Aw, yeah. I think I got it.

862
00:54:55,102 --> 00:54:56,737
I'm not sure what this is.

863
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:59,906
We need to figure out
what's stored on this card.

864
00:55:00,041 --> 00:55:02,476
Okay, there's a town at
the foot of the mountain.

865
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:04,245
Let's investigate there.

866
00:55:13,287 --> 00:55:16,023
The target fled to the
neighboring country of Klayd.

867
00:55:16,157 --> 00:55:17,692
I'm afraid I don't
have the authority

868
00:55:17,824 --> 00:55:19,926
to search inside
their borders, sir.

869
00:55:20,061 --> 00:55:23,364
No matter.
If he has fled the country,

870
00:55:23,497 --> 00:55:25,309
then he won't be able
to interfere with the plan

871
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:27,834
while it's being
carried out, will he?

872
00:55:30,771 --> 00:55:34,208
The time for revelation and
the great reckoning has come!

873
00:55:34,342 --> 00:55:36,910
For humanity's salvation!

874
00:55:37,044 --> 00:55:42,016
For humanity's salvation!
For humanity's salvation!

875
00:55:42,149 --> 00:55:44,151
For humanity's salvation!

876
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:47,887
For the salvation of humanity!

877
00:56:12,946 --> 00:56:14,148
Emergency alert, sir!

878
00:56:14,281 --> 00:56:15,583
Humarise has started a broadcast

879
00:56:15,716 --> 00:56:17,651
and it's streaming
across the planet.

880
00:56:17,785 --> 00:56:20,121
Put it on the screen!

881
00:56:20,254 --> 00:56:23,290
Humarise will now
fulfill its purpose.

882
00:56:23,424 --> 00:56:26,694
To protect the pure humans
who are called "powerless,"

883
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:29,896
against those who have been
infected by the wicked disease

884
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,500
known as Quirks.

885
00:56:32,633 --> 00:56:35,336
We have developed
humanity salvation devices

886
00:56:35,469 --> 00:56:37,471
that will cleanse this world.

887
00:56:37,605 --> 00:56:41,409
Soon, they will be activated
in 25 countries.

888
00:56:41,542 --> 00:56:42,843
Seriously?

889
00:56:42,976 --> 00:56:45,613
This deliverance from
evil shall be witnessed

890
00:56:45,746 --> 00:56:47,848
by all in two hours.

891
00:56:47,981 --> 00:56:50,084
That's hardly any time at all!

892
00:56:50,217 --> 00:56:52,853
However, we are
not without mercy.

893
00:56:52,986 --> 00:56:57,024
If you wish to prevent this
plan from going into effect,

894
00:56:57,158 --> 00:56:59,360
we will generously
reveal the countries

895
00:56:59,493 --> 00:57:01,695
where our devices
have been installed.

896
00:57:01,829 --> 00:57:03,397
What is he playing at?

897
00:57:03,531 --> 00:57:06,600
Even if you do not
understand our righteous cause,

898
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:10,371
you will have a
chance to live on.

899
00:57:11,806 --> 00:57:13,107
Director.

900
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,443
These are the 25 zones
the bombs are placed in.

901
00:57:15,576 --> 00:57:19,013
They match up with the locations
of known Humarise branches!

902
00:57:19,146 --> 00:57:21,615
It's possible this
is a giant trap.

903
00:57:21,749 --> 00:57:25,419
But we can't afford
to be that cautious.

904
00:57:25,553 --> 00:57:26,830
Give marching orders

905
00:57:26,854 --> 00:57:28,823
to the hero teams on standby!

906
00:57:28,955 --> 00:57:29,955
Yes, sir!

907
00:57:31,659 --> 00:57:33,993
There's widespread panic in
each of the 25 affected zones.

908
00:57:38,632 --> 00:57:41,968
Surrounding areas
are in chaos as well.

909
00:57:44,438 --> 00:57:45,782
Streets are gridlocked.

910
00:57:45,806 --> 00:57:47,475
Transportation is a mess.

911
00:57:47,608 --> 00:57:48,776
Oh, no!

912
00:57:48,909 --> 00:57:50,911
Sun eater, you search
for anybody who's injured.

913
00:57:51,045 --> 00:57:54,782
Red Riot and Real Steel, you
secure a solid evacuation route!

914
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:56,217
Roger that!

915
00:57:57,651 --> 00:57:59,553
Chimera Kraken!

916
00:58:03,090 --> 00:58:04,859
Let's do this!

917
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:06,727
Come on, Red Gauntlet!

918
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:10,698
There! This is your way out!

919
00:58:10,831 --> 00:58:12,111
Don't stand there gawking... go!

920
00:58:12,199 --> 00:58:12,999
Cementos!

921
00:58:13,133 --> 00:58:15,336
Make it a loud one, Mic.

922
00:58:16,136 --> 00:58:19,473
Listen up, everybody!

923
00:58:19,607 --> 00:58:23,077
We've got a rockin' path for you
over here, so get to sliding!

924
00:58:23,210 --> 00:58:26,547
Remain calm. Don't panic!

925
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:30,117
We're counting on
you, search team!

926
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:33,053
Find me that
Trigger Bomb immediately.

927
00:58:33,187 --> 00:58:34,054
Hear me?

928
00:58:34,188 --> 00:58:36,023
Understood, sir!

929
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:41,262
Ribbit!

930
00:58:41,395 --> 00:58:44,331
We've got the
evacuations under control!

931
00:58:44,465 --> 00:58:46,834
Then it's up to us to
find the enemy's device.

932
00:58:46,967 --> 00:58:47,968
Right!

933
00:58:48,102 --> 00:58:49,803
Tsukuyomi, leave the evacuations

934
00:58:49,937 --> 00:58:51,305
to the American team.

935
00:58:51,438 --> 00:58:53,274
It'll be easier for us
to find that death bomb

936
00:58:53,407 --> 00:58:54,441
with a bird's-eye view.

937
00:58:54,575 --> 00:58:56,076
Roger that!

938
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:58,412
Go. Fierce Wings!

939
00:58:59,613 --> 00:59:01,849
Leave no corner unsearched.

940
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:06,387
Tokage! Take these sensors and
spread them around the city.

941
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:10,558
No sweat! We won't
let anyone die today.

942
00:59:10,691 --> 00:59:13,427
Momo, Shall we
head to the next spot?

943
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:14,561
Yes, sir!

944
00:59:16,897 --> 00:59:18,566
How are we supposed
to find a tiny bomb

945
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:20,568
hiding somewhere
in this huge city?

946
00:59:20,701 --> 00:59:23,170
Hello! Hello! Hello!

947
00:59:23,304 --> 00:59:24,772
Whoa, Salaam!

948
00:59:24,905 --> 00:59:27,942
You must find what you seek,
not seek what you find!

949
00:59:28,075 --> 00:59:29,443
Follow me young ones!

950
00:59:29,577 --> 00:59:30,844
He's so fast!

951
00:59:30,978 --> 00:59:33,781
Guess being paper
thin has its perks.

952
00:59:33,914 --> 00:59:35,592
Clair, where's
the device, dammit?

953
00:59:35,616 --> 00:59:37,351
There's no sign of it
in this area.

954
00:59:37,484 --> 00:59:39,086
Moving to the next location.

955
00:59:41,455 --> 00:59:43,824
Shoto. What are you doing?

956
00:59:43,958 --> 00:59:46,193
Hurry up and get back here.

957
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:53,467
So many folders.

958
00:59:53,601 --> 00:59:54,768
Where do we even start?

959
00:59:54,902 --> 00:59:55,970
Move it!

960
00:59:56,103 --> 00:59:58,272
Where's the most
recent time stamp?

961
00:59:58,405 --> 01:00:00,341
It's this video file.

962
01:00:02,876 --> 01:00:06,081
Hello. My name is Alan Kay.

963
01:00:06,213 --> 01:00:07,948
Along with several
other scientists,

964
01:00:08,083 --> 01:00:09,917
I was kidnapped by Humarise.

965
01:00:10,051 --> 01:00:11,452
Kidnapped?

966
01:00:11,585 --> 01:00:13,025
In order to enact their plans,

967
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,556
Humarise took our families
hostage and forced us

968
01:00:15,689 --> 01:00:17,958
to manufacture Quirk
Factor Triggering Bombs

969
01:00:18,093 --> 01:00:19,960
against our wills.

970
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,563
The first terrorist attack
using one of these devices

971
01:00:22,696 --> 01:00:25,466
was merely a ploy, to gather
the world's top heroes

972
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,336
in places where Humarise
branches are located.

973
01:00:29,470 --> 01:00:31,872
The group is planning to
use these horrible bombs

974
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:33,674
to eradicate those pros.

975
01:00:33,807 --> 01:00:38,779
In an instant, the hero
population will be decimated.

976
01:00:38,912 --> 01:00:42,117
After losing its top heroes,
society would collapse.

977
01:00:42,249 --> 01:00:44,151
Using the vacuum
of chaos afterward,

978
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:46,054
Humarise will wipe out
anyone with powers

979
01:00:46,186 --> 01:00:49,757
and build a world where only
the Quirkless are allowed.

980
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:54,928
That is the true goal of Flect
Turn, the leader of Humarise.

981
01:00:55,063 --> 01:00:57,231
A madman.

982
01:00:57,364 --> 01:01:00,135
I hope my voice will
reach the heroes in time.

983
01:01:00,267 --> 01:01:04,872
Eddie Soul, another scientist
here, lost his life helping me.

984
01:01:05,006 --> 01:01:07,741
He made the key I've included
that will disarm the bombs

985
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:08,875
at their base.

986
01:01:08,909 --> 01:01:12,212
Please. Save the world.

987
01:01:21,755 --> 01:01:23,824
I repeat,
Humarise, the organization

988
01:01:23,957 --> 01:01:26,094
advocating for the
salvation of humanity,

989
01:01:26,226 --> 01:01:27,861
has placed bombs
around the world.

990
01:01:27,995 --> 01:01:30,864
The weapons are set to explode
in one hour and 52 minutes,

991
01:01:30,998 --> 01:01:34,735
unless the heroes are able to
find and disarm them, worldwide.

992
01:01:34,868 --> 01:01:37,172
As you might expect,
panic has gripped the areas

993
01:01:37,304 --> 01:01:39,406
where the devices
are said to be located.

994
01:01:39,540 --> 01:01:42,043
Heroes have been working
to evacuate people to safety

995
01:01:42,177 --> 01:01:43,944
and subvert this attack.

996
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:46,280
Areas in danger of being
affected by the bombs

997
01:01:46,413 --> 01:01:47,881
are as follows.

998
01:01:48,016 --> 01:01:49,316
No, it can't be.

999
01:01:49,450 --> 01:01:52,853
That circle's in Otheon!
My house is inside of it!

1000
01:01:52,986 --> 01:01:55,422
Oh, no.

1001
01:01:55,556 --> 01:01:57,591
Where are you?

1002
01:02:00,694 --> 01:02:02,305
We should send
this to HQ and have them

1003
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:04,465
order the hero teams to
retreat before it's too late.

1004
01:02:04,598 --> 01:02:06,600
We can't do that.

1005
01:02:09,137 --> 01:02:12,806
The heroes are out there
looking for the Trigger Bombs.

1006
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:16,610
Even if they're the actual
targets of the terrorist attack.

1007
01:02:16,744 --> 01:02:19,346
Even if they know
this is a trap.

1008
01:02:19,480 --> 01:02:22,349
As long as there are
people who need help,

1009
01:02:22,483 --> 01:02:25,086
the pros will never
leave them and run away.

1010
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:27,554
That's what makes them heroes.

1011
01:02:28,789 --> 01:02:32,359
Humarise counted on this when
they came up with their plan.

1012
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:37,631
Then we use that disarming key.

1013
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:41,136
It's up to us to
stop those bombs.

1014
01:02:41,268 --> 01:02:42,870
But how do we do that?

1015
01:02:43,003 --> 01:02:44,239
On it!

1016
01:02:44,371 --> 01:02:46,174
The answer has to be
in here somewhere.

1017
01:02:46,306 --> 01:02:47,586
You're an idiot
if you make a key

1018
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:50,544
without telling people
where the lock is!

1019
01:02:50,677 --> 01:02:51,788
We look for the
place that wasn't

1020
01:02:51,812 --> 01:02:54,215
part of their announcement.

1021
01:02:54,348 --> 01:02:56,850
This is where their base is!

1022
01:02:56,984 --> 01:02:59,586
Kacchan, Can you find
where the bomb controls are?

1023
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:03,258
Let me work, ya damn nerd!

1024
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:05,160
The furthest area underground.

1025
01:03:05,325 --> 01:03:08,495
So we know where it is, but it's
more than 400 kilometers away

1026
01:03:08,629 --> 01:03:10,265
from where we are.

1027
01:03:10,397 --> 01:03:12,733
We can make it.

1028
01:03:12,866 --> 01:03:15,302
I think I know how
to get us there.

1029
01:03:21,075 --> 01:03:24,344
Don't worry.
I know the basic controls.

1030
01:03:24,478 --> 01:03:26,713
This is no time to be chirping!

1031
01:03:30,118 --> 01:03:33,387
We'll definitely
stop the Trigger Bombs.

1032
01:03:36,157 --> 01:03:39,326
We'll crush those
crazy cult bastards!

1033
01:03:42,863 --> 01:03:45,300
We'll protect the heroes,

1034
01:03:45,432 --> 01:03:49,070
our friends, and the world!

1035
01:03:51,939 --> 01:03:53,550
We just received
a transmission from Shoto.

1036
01:03:53,574 --> 01:03:55,676
He's a hero who
was sent to Otheon.

1037
01:03:55,809 --> 01:03:58,012
He says that he's obtained
a master disarming key

1038
01:03:58,146 --> 01:03:59,013
for the Trigger Bombs!

1039
01:03:59,147 --> 01:04:00,614
Where is he now?

1040
01:04:00,747 --> 01:04:02,159
Heading to where
the villain's main system

1041
01:04:02,183 --> 01:04:05,086
is located, inside a
hidden Humarise facility.

1042
01:04:05,220 --> 01:04:09,190
Young Todoroki. Young Bakugo.

1043
01:04:09,324 --> 01:04:11,025
Young Midoriya.

1044
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:14,295
Shoto's figured out a way
to disarm these damn devices?

1045
01:04:14,428 --> 01:04:15,629
Then let's go support him!

1046
01:04:15,762 --> 01:04:17,965
We can't. Our priority
is evacuation

1047
01:04:18,099 --> 01:04:19,099
in case he should fail.

1048
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:19,867
Endeavor!

1049
01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:21,001
What is it?

1050
01:04:21,135 --> 01:04:22,495
I finally found the target.

1051
01:04:22,536 --> 01:04:24,072
Where?

1052
01:04:24,205 --> 01:04:26,250
It's in front of the
north gate of Otheon Tower.

1053
01:04:26,274 --> 01:04:28,942
Inside a semi-truck!

1054
01:04:29,077 --> 01:04:30,357
Heroes near the tower.

1055
01:04:30,477 --> 01:04:32,080
Get that bomb out of here!

1056
01:04:32,213 --> 01:04:33,314
Roger!

1057
01:04:33,447 --> 01:04:35,083
...Clair, come in!

1058
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:37,885
What the hell is this?

1059
01:04:38,019 --> 01:04:40,221
Shoji! They're saying
Midoriya and the others

1060
01:04:40,355 --> 01:04:42,190
are heading to disarm the bombs!

1061
01:04:42,323 --> 01:04:43,924
Don't lose focus!

1062
01:04:44,058 --> 01:04:46,327
For now, we need to keep
concentrating on the mission

1063
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:47,494
we were charged with.

1064
01:04:47,628 --> 01:04:49,463
Right. Yeah.

1065
01:04:50,497 --> 01:04:53,800
There! I've found it.

1066
01:04:54,701 --> 01:04:57,171
It's in the third container
of that freight train!

1067
01:04:57,305 --> 01:04:58,572
Quickly, shrimps! Go!

1068
01:04:58,705 --> 01:04:59,973
We're on it.

1069
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:08,349
Oh, no! Villains!

1070
01:05:08,482 --> 01:05:10,318
Crap. Of course
there'd be guards.

1071
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:12,619
Uravity, Froppy, hurry!

1072
01:05:12,753 --> 01:05:14,322
Get that bomb away
from everyone!

1073
01:05:14,454 --> 01:05:15,689
Yes, ma'am!

1074
01:05:17,225 --> 01:05:18,705
I believe Deku and the others

1075
01:05:18,825 --> 01:05:20,727
will stop the bombs for us!

1076
01:05:20,861 --> 01:05:24,531
But we'll do what we can
to back them up until then!

1077
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:29,037
Get outta the way!

1078
01:05:30,671 --> 01:05:32,082
Our teams
have found the devices.

1079
01:05:32,106 --> 01:05:33,416
But they're meeting
resistance from Humarise.

1080
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,675
They're not making this easy.

1081
01:05:34,808 --> 01:05:38,212
We have less than
30 minutes on the clock.

1082
01:05:38,346 --> 01:05:41,648
The pros across the
world are fighting desperately.

1083
01:05:41,782 --> 01:05:45,485
But we're counting on
you now, future heroes!

1084
01:05:52,327 --> 01:05:54,228
Almost there.

1085
01:05:58,565 --> 01:06:01,069
The afflicted must be purged.

1086
01:06:04,705 --> 01:06:06,640
That's it! The base!

1087
01:06:06,773 --> 01:06:08,809
Going in for a landing.
Brace yourselves.

1088
01:06:08,942 --> 01:06:11,179
No. Rody, you turn back.

1089
01:06:11,312 --> 01:06:12,746
What?

1090
01:06:12,879 --> 01:06:14,457
Extras like you
should stay out of the way.

1091
01:06:14,481 --> 01:06:15,949
He has a point.

1092
01:06:16,084 --> 01:06:18,124
This is a job for heroes!

1093
01:06:24,725 --> 01:06:27,561
I don't have time
for you idiots!

1094
01:06:31,932 --> 01:06:34,102
Some of their
members have Quirks, too!

1095
01:06:34,235 --> 01:06:36,937
I didn't expect there
to be so many of them!

1096
01:06:42,310 --> 01:06:44,045
A sound wave?

1097
01:06:47,248 --> 01:06:48,891
...Kacchan!

1098
01:06:48,915 --> 01:06:51,152
Yeah, yeah, I know!

1099
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,195
I've got you!

1100
01:07:02,363 --> 01:07:04,598
Bakugo, we'll leave
these guys to you!

1101
01:07:04,731 --> 01:07:06,467
Stop them!

1102
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,070
Don't tell me what to do!

1103
01:07:09,203 --> 01:07:11,972
Take them down!

1104
01:07:12,106 --> 01:07:14,075
It's a right at the
end of this hallway.

1105
01:07:14,208 --> 01:07:15,243
Hold on.

1106
01:07:21,648 --> 01:07:24,551
Huh. Couldn't be easier.

1107
01:07:33,394 --> 01:07:35,463
Why are you
morons helping Humarise?

1108
01:07:35,595 --> 01:07:37,964
You've got Quirks!

1109
01:07:38,099 --> 01:07:41,868
Because we were personally
chosen by Flect as the worthy.

1110
01:07:42,002 --> 01:07:43,904
We will work alongside Humarise

1111
01:07:44,038 --> 01:07:46,240
and live in their rebuilt world!

1112
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:48,042
Tch. Oh, I get it,

1113
01:07:48,176 --> 01:07:51,312
you're just trying to
save your own butts.

1114
01:07:51,446 --> 01:07:55,949
Talk about selfish.
As expected of villains.

1115
01:07:56,850 --> 01:07:58,752
Die!

1116
01:08:01,988 --> 01:08:03,757
They're fast!

1117
01:08:20,408 --> 01:08:23,944
I won't just stay behind.
I have to help!

1118
01:08:27,681 --> 01:08:30,917
You're Rody Soul, aren't you?

1119
01:08:44,499 --> 01:08:45,500
Todoroki!

1120
01:08:45,632 --> 01:08:48,136
You go on ahead!
Fast as you can.

1121
01:08:55,842 --> 01:08:59,247
I'll stop you all at once.

1122
01:08:59,380 --> 01:09:02,383
Flash freeze... Heatwave!

1123
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,415
My flames had no affect?

1124
01:09:41,955 --> 01:09:43,757
He's raging out of control.

1125
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,359
Is he on Trigger?

1126
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:17,458
Somehow he's rotating his Quirk

1127
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:19,493
to control the flow of water.

1128
01:10:21,495 --> 01:10:23,464
Smash!

1129
01:10:37,978 --> 01:10:39,180
The crap?

1130
01:10:39,313 --> 01:10:41,315
How'd they cut through
my explosion?

1131
01:10:48,822 --> 01:10:52,859
You must not realize
you're facing the best!

1132
01:10:55,229 --> 01:10:56,564
Point blank range!

1133
01:11:06,840 --> 01:11:08,009
Too bad!

1134
01:11:08,142 --> 01:11:11,012
All that jumping
around's annoying!

1135
01:11:34,702 --> 01:11:39,373
Stop your laughing.
It's getting on my nerves!

1136
01:11:58,059 --> 01:12:01,162
Idiots never
saw that coming, huh?

1137
01:12:01,295 --> 01:12:04,931
I planted a few grenades
while we were fighting.

1138
01:12:27,822 --> 01:12:31,858
Hell, If you wanna get crazy,
I'm right there with you.

1139
01:12:31,991 --> 01:12:34,428
Hurry! Faster!

1140
01:12:35,830 --> 01:12:38,032
Get outta my way!

1141
01:12:48,442 --> 01:12:51,112
This is the deepest
room in the base.

1142
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:55,616
Which means the
Trigger Bomb control system

1143
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:58,252
should be on the other
side of those doors.

1144
01:13:01,722 --> 01:13:03,023
How dare you?

1145
01:13:03,157 --> 01:13:05,426
This is not a place where
someone so diseased

1146
01:13:05,559 --> 01:13:07,395
should set foot.

1147
01:13:07,528 --> 01:13:09,563
He must be their leader.

1148
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:11,931
Flect Turn.

1149
01:13:12,066 --> 01:13:14,034
You have entered
a holy stronghold

1150
01:13:14,168 --> 01:13:17,138
that will bring about
the salvation of humanity.

1151
01:13:18,606 --> 01:13:20,541
You think this
is what the world needs?

1152
01:13:20,674 --> 01:13:24,378
The Quirk Doomsday Theory hasn't
been scientifically verified!

1153
01:13:24,512 --> 01:13:27,114
You're basing your crimes
on nothing but a rumor!

1154
01:13:27,248 --> 01:13:29,517
How can you accept
something so uncertain

1155
01:13:29,650 --> 01:13:33,220
and use it to justify
doing such terrible things?

1156
01:13:33,354 --> 01:13:35,122
Pure humans are being threatened

1157
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:39,993
by the sickness of Quirks.
Of that there is no doubt.

1158
01:13:40,127 --> 01:13:44,064
As time passes these powers will
mix, evolve, and run rampant,

1159
01:13:44,198 --> 01:13:47,067
driving humanity to destruction.

1160
01:13:47,201 --> 01:13:49,437
You don't know that for certain!

1161
01:13:49,570 --> 01:13:52,173
Whether you have a Quirk
or not doesn't matter.

1162
01:13:52,306 --> 01:13:55,743
We're all alive.
We're all human beings!

1163
01:13:55,876 --> 01:13:59,580
The gravely afflicted
are beyond our help.

1164
01:13:59,713 --> 01:14:02,949
I suppose I shall have
to force you to atone.

1165
01:14:03,083 --> 01:14:04,227
I'll stop your Trigger Bomb

1166
01:14:04,251 --> 01:14:06,253
if it's the last thing I do!

1167
01:14:07,755 --> 01:14:10,424
Smash!

1168
01:14:32,179 --> 01:14:35,216
Did he counter my attack?

1169
01:14:35,349 --> 01:14:38,985
No, this shock and force.

1170
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:41,722
It felt like I was
hit with a Smash.

1171
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:45,159
That's right.

1172
01:14:45,292 --> 01:14:49,063
I was born with this
cursed plague myself.

1173
01:14:49,196 --> 01:14:51,532
A disease that can't be cured.

1174
01:14:51,665 --> 01:14:55,402
I automatically reflect
all I come in contact with.

1175
01:14:55,536 --> 01:14:57,104
I knew it.

1176
01:14:57,238 --> 01:15:00,274
His Quirk makes any attack
against him bounce back.

1177
01:15:00,407 --> 01:15:03,811
It's the kind of power
that's always activated.

1178
01:15:03,944 --> 01:15:07,081
So even though you have
an ability of your own,

1179
01:15:07,214 --> 01:15:09,483
you still think
they're somehow evil?

1180
01:15:17,892 --> 01:15:21,128
Long-distance attacks
don't work either.

1181
01:15:21,262 --> 01:15:23,631
You would question me?

1182
01:15:26,166 --> 01:15:28,035
Quirks are a tragedy.

1183
01:15:28,168 --> 01:15:32,239
Because of this ailment, I was
never once held by my parents,

1184
01:15:32,373 --> 01:15:34,875
never knew a caring touch.

1185
01:15:35,010 --> 01:15:38,479
Even my closest friends,
and those I gave my heart to

1186
01:15:38,612 --> 01:15:41,615
left me, their
feelings repelled.

1187
01:15:41,749 --> 01:15:45,786
I watched them all
leave me, one by one.

1188
01:15:45,920 --> 01:15:47,454
Since I reflect everything,

1189
01:15:47,588 --> 01:15:51,191
I couldn't even choose
death for myself.

1190
01:15:51,325 --> 01:15:53,460
A Quirk that
cannot be controlled

1191
01:15:53,594 --> 01:15:57,331
leads to a life of suffering.

1192
01:15:57,464 --> 01:16:00,568
But I can save others
from this misery.

1193
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:04,171
These meta powers will
trample no more hearts.

1194
01:16:04,305 --> 01:16:05,906
I won't use One For All

1195
01:16:06,041 --> 01:16:08,075
until the moment of impact!

1196
01:16:12,047 --> 01:16:13,048
Even then...

1197
01:16:13,180 --> 01:16:14,648
...it didn't work!

1198
01:16:27,728 --> 01:16:29,296
The clock is ticking.

1199
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:31,865
I'll try to avoid
him completely.

1200
01:16:33,534 --> 01:16:37,504
Right. Rely on speed,
and get to the controls.

1201
01:16:37,638 --> 01:16:40,874
I reject the corruption
within my veins.

1202
01:16:44,478 --> 01:16:47,082
I will eradicate
this global contamination

1203
01:16:47,214 --> 01:16:49,116
before it's too late.

1204
01:16:49,249 --> 01:16:51,552
By doing so,
I will save the worthy.

1205
01:16:51,685 --> 01:16:55,189
The pure humans will rise
to power once again.

1206
01:17:07,334 --> 01:17:09,403
You wretched soul.

1207
01:17:15,576 --> 01:17:19,713
In mere minutes,
the baptism will begin.

1208
01:17:19,847 --> 01:17:23,084
The blood of heroes will
cleanse this broken world.

1209
01:17:23,217 --> 01:17:26,954
And their deaths will bring
about a glorious new reality.

1210
01:17:27,088 --> 01:17:30,058
I won't let you.

1211
01:17:30,190 --> 01:17:32,292
Talk all you want.

1212
01:17:32,426 --> 01:17:34,762
I will stop the Trigger Bombs!

1213
01:17:35,863 --> 01:17:37,331
No.

1214
01:17:37,464 --> 01:17:41,769
You will be sacrificed
like your friends.

1215
01:17:44,405 --> 01:17:46,674
Uraraka.

1216
01:17:46,807 --> 01:17:48,175
Asui.

1217
01:17:50,344 --> 01:17:52,013
Kaminari.

1218
01:17:52,147 --> 01:17:53,280
Sero.

1219
01:17:53,414 --> 01:17:54,748
Mineta.

1220
01:17:57,251 --> 01:17:58,886
Kirishima.

1221
01:17:59,020 --> 01:18:00,788
Shoji.

1222
01:18:00,921 --> 01:18:02,123
Jiro.

1223
01:18:04,125 --> 01:18:07,361
Yaoyorozu.

1224
01:18:07,494 --> 01:18:10,330
You're all fighting
so desperately.

1225
01:18:12,466 --> 01:18:17,538
To stop these
weapons from going off.

1226
01:18:17,671 --> 01:18:20,574
To protect everyone's smiles.

1227
01:18:23,410 --> 01:18:25,479
Think.

1228
01:18:25,612 --> 01:18:27,981
How can I beat this guy?

1229
01:18:45,733 --> 01:18:48,769
Rody. Why?

1230
01:18:48,902 --> 01:18:51,172
It's fine now, Deku,
don't you worry.

1231
01:18:51,305 --> 01:18:56,477
No. You have to run.

1232
01:18:56,610 --> 01:18:57,911
I will.

1233
01:18:58,046 --> 01:19:00,948
Once I hand this over
to the blue guy.

1234
01:19:02,183 --> 01:19:05,220
The disarming key?

1235
01:19:05,352 --> 01:19:07,354
What?

1236
01:19:07,488 --> 01:19:10,524
Know that I am sorry.

1237
01:19:10,657 --> 01:19:12,993
But they said they'd stop
the Otheon explosion

1238
01:19:13,128 --> 01:19:15,896
if I helped them out.

1239
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:18,665
Rody. Don't do this.

1240
01:19:18,799 --> 01:19:21,368
If we work together, we can
stop him and save everybody.

1241
01:19:21,502 --> 01:19:22,736
Please!

1242
01:19:23,604 --> 01:19:25,106
How are you gonna stop anything

1243
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:27,008
when you're all messed up?

1244
01:19:27,142 --> 01:19:31,045
We're out of time.
The bombs are gonna explode.

1245
01:19:31,179 --> 01:19:32,279
It's game over.

1246
01:19:32,412 --> 01:19:34,615
No.

1247
01:19:34,748 --> 01:19:37,851
At least... I'm going
to protect my family.

1248
01:19:37,985 --> 01:19:39,720
I can do that much.

1249
01:19:45,059 --> 01:19:46,161
Look.

1250
01:19:46,293 --> 01:19:48,629
I'm a worthless
delinquent, Deku.

1251
01:19:48,762 --> 01:19:51,899
I can't take on the world,
much less save it.

1252
01:19:52,033 --> 01:19:54,535
I'm not a hero like you.

1253
01:19:54,668 --> 01:19:58,539
If I have to pick between
society or my family surviving,

1254
01:19:58,672 --> 01:20:02,010
the choice isn't that hard.

1255
01:20:02,143 --> 01:20:03,844
It was the same for my dad.

1256
01:20:03,977 --> 01:20:06,181
You forced his hand.

1257
01:20:06,313 --> 01:20:08,149
That's true.

1258
01:20:08,283 --> 01:20:09,550
Your father, Eddie Soul,

1259
01:20:09,683 --> 01:20:12,086
helped develop the
human salvation bomb.

1260
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:15,589
He knew that if he didn't,
your lives would be forfeit.

1261
01:20:19,560 --> 01:20:21,728
It was him.

1262
01:20:21,862 --> 01:20:24,364
Eddie Soul,
another scientist here,

1263
01:20:24,498 --> 01:20:26,600
lost his life helping me.

1264
01:20:26,733 --> 01:20:29,970
Please. Save the world.

1265
01:20:34,675 --> 01:20:36,476
My dad didn't "help" you.

1266
01:20:36,610 --> 01:20:38,579
You threatened to murder
our whole family.

1267
01:20:38,712 --> 01:20:40,848
He only worked for you
because you made him.

1268
01:20:40,981 --> 01:20:44,551
Fortunately, he had the clarity
to make the correct decision.

1269
01:20:44,685 --> 01:20:48,189
And it appears you're a wise man
just like your father.

1270
01:20:48,323 --> 01:20:50,357
You're protecting
your loved ones.

1271
01:20:50,490 --> 01:20:53,627
An honorable choice.
I commend you.

1272
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,096
We're quite alike.

1273
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,531
I developed this plan
because I love humanity

1274
01:20:57,664 --> 01:20:59,433
and wish to save it.

1275
01:20:59,566 --> 01:21:03,037
Rody, please. You can't do this.

1276
01:21:03,171 --> 01:21:04,638
Rody!

1277
01:21:06,673 --> 01:21:09,476
We can stop him.

1278
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:15,983
Sorry, hero, but this
is how it all ends.

1279
01:21:16,117 --> 01:21:20,021
That's life.
People get betrayed.

1280
01:21:20,154 --> 01:21:24,359
If it's any condolence,
it happened to me, too.

1281
01:21:24,491 --> 01:21:26,460
Nothing to cry about.

1282
01:21:27,362 --> 01:21:29,063
Rody.

1283
01:21:37,004 --> 01:21:40,174
What about you.
I mean, do you have a Quirk?

1284
01:21:40,308 --> 01:21:42,709
I've been wondering.

1285
01:21:42,843 --> 01:21:45,079
You won't laugh, will you?

1286
01:21:45,213 --> 01:21:47,148
I promise!

1287
01:21:47,282 --> 01:21:49,783
Really?

1288
01:21:49,917 --> 01:21:52,519
No! I swear it!

1289
01:21:52,653 --> 01:21:55,889
Okay. It's kinda weird.

1290
01:22:04,831 --> 01:22:06,234
Pino!

1291
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:11,372
Nice job.

1292
01:22:11,505 --> 01:22:13,473
The plan's working, huh?

1293
01:22:16,110 --> 01:22:18,912
- ...- Deku!
- ...You foolish boy!

1294
01:22:23,384 --> 01:22:25,086
Don't stop!

1295
01:22:37,298 --> 01:22:38,899
No!

1296
01:22:44,638 --> 01:22:46,040
Rody!

1297
01:22:50,211 --> 01:22:52,713
You impertinent child!

1298
01:22:58,219 --> 01:22:59,619
Deku!

1299
01:23:02,023 --> 01:23:04,725
Don't you dare die.
You kick his ass!

1300
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:09,197
I'll stop the bombs! And you.

1301
01:23:09,330 --> 01:23:11,165
You take 'im down, hero!

1302
01:23:11,299 --> 01:23:12,632
Let's go!

1303
01:23:22,176 --> 01:23:23,444
I'm the end of the line.

1304
01:23:23,577 --> 01:23:25,146
I don't care how strong you are.

1305
01:23:25,279 --> 01:23:27,281
You won't get past me!

1306
01:23:40,961 --> 01:23:44,132
What about you?
I mean, do you have a Quirk?

1307
01:23:44,265 --> 01:23:45,966
I've been wondering.

1308
01:23:48,202 --> 01:23:50,670
You may think I'm joking, but...

1309
01:23:50,804 --> 01:23:52,273
It's Pino.

1310
01:23:52,407 --> 01:23:53,540
Ya see,

1311
01:23:53,673 --> 01:23:56,044
her actions show
my true intentions.

1312
01:23:56,177 --> 01:23:57,177
Really?

1313
01:23:57,245 --> 01:23:59,679
No matter how good
I am at lying,

1314
01:23:59,813 --> 01:24:02,582
Pino always gives away
how I truly feel.

1315
01:24:02,716 --> 01:24:04,018
Almost.

1316
01:24:04,152 --> 01:24:10,425
Honestly, it's
not much of a Quirk.

1317
01:24:10,557 --> 01:24:13,461
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1318
01:24:13,593 --> 01:24:18,099
Not being able to lie?
I think that's pretty amazing.

1319
01:24:40,821 --> 01:24:42,821
Damn it!
They're hammering my right side.

1320
01:25:13,753 --> 01:25:15,655
I think it's about time

1321
01:25:15,789 --> 01:25:18,625
that you two shut it for good.

1322
01:25:35,610 --> 01:25:37,944
No holding back.

1323
01:25:40,714 --> 01:25:45,486
You're not getting up!

1324
01:25:45,620 --> 01:25:50,757
Howitzer Impact!

1325
01:26:09,443 --> 01:26:12,679
Happy now? You idiots.

1326
01:26:20,521 --> 01:26:24,425
I'm... losing consciousness.

1327
01:26:25,526 --> 01:26:27,128
Is that...?

1328
01:26:33,034 --> 01:26:35,303
One last chance.

1329
01:26:56,224 --> 01:26:58,758
I won't let you
get in Midoriya's way!

1330
01:26:58,892 --> 01:27:01,795
Flash freeze Heatwave!

1331
01:27:18,512 --> 01:27:22,316
You can manipulate flames, too?

1332
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:23,451
Fine.

1333
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:26,886
This is the most powerful
move I've got!

1334
01:27:28,723 --> 01:27:31,891
My Flash fire Fist.

1335
01:27:33,094 --> 01:27:36,130
Jet Kindling!

1336
01:27:56,284 --> 01:27:58,753
Midoriya.

1337
01:27:58,885 --> 01:28:02,989
Make sure you stop them.

1338
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:30,950
I'll be... like my dad.

1339
01:28:34,888 --> 01:28:36,490
And Deku.

1340
01:28:38,125 --> 01:28:42,029
He would never give up.

1341
01:28:50,571 --> 01:28:52,006
Rody?

1342
01:28:59,413 --> 01:29:02,249
For both father
and son to die in vain.

1343
01:29:02,383 --> 01:29:05,019
There's no hope
for such fetid scum.

1344
01:29:05,152 --> 01:29:06,953
Shut up.

1345
01:29:09,023 --> 01:29:10,658
Rody's not scum.

1346
01:29:10,791 --> 01:29:15,096
He's my friend, and more noble
than you could ever hope to be.

1347
01:29:17,331 --> 01:29:19,800
What a pity.

1348
01:29:19,933 --> 01:29:23,037
You still refuse to understand?

1349
01:29:23,170 --> 01:29:25,473
Look at how brave he is!

1350
01:29:25,606 --> 01:29:32,446
I believe in Rody!
Because I believe in heroes!

1351
01:29:38,352 --> 01:29:40,388
We need to lay down
cover for Endeavor!

1352
01:29:40,521 --> 01:29:41,589
Fight, Shoto.

1353
01:29:41,722 --> 01:29:44,625
But whatever happens,
I'll protect them.

1354
01:29:46,427 --> 01:29:48,229
Push it faster, Fierce Wings!

1355
01:29:48,362 --> 01:29:50,331
Get that weapon out of here.

1356
01:29:51,832 --> 01:29:53,134
Hawks, Quick!

1357
01:29:53,267 --> 01:29:54,867
We've just discovered
a new Trigger Bomb.

1358
01:29:54,901 --> 01:29:57,071
What? Well, is anyone on it?

1359
01:29:57,204 --> 01:29:58,914
This one
should be taken care of.

1360
01:29:58,938 --> 01:30:00,274
Any remaining devices?

1361
01:30:00,408 --> 01:30:01,876
We currently know of two.

1362
01:30:02,009 --> 01:30:03,811
Wait! I've found a new one.

1363
01:30:03,943 --> 01:30:05,063
So there's a total of three.

1364
01:30:06,547 --> 01:30:08,416
No way are the bad guys winning!

1365
01:30:08,549 --> 01:30:10,117
Right, Bakugo?

1366
01:30:12,586 --> 01:30:16,490
I'll get this in the
air and send if far away...

1367
01:30:16,624 --> 01:30:17,957
Ribbit!

1368
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:22,129
Ochaco! We lost control!

1369
01:30:22,263 --> 01:30:23,898
I won't give up!

1370
01:30:24,031 --> 01:30:26,966
Because Deku would
never give up!

1371
01:30:30,671 --> 01:30:33,174
Midoriya and the
others will fight to the end.

1372
01:30:33,307 --> 01:30:36,076
So we won't stop!

1373
01:30:40,281 --> 01:30:43,717
It's my duty, as a hero.

1374
01:30:43,851 --> 01:30:45,019
That's right.

1375
01:30:45,152 --> 01:30:47,288
Heroes always
see things through!

1376
01:30:47,421 --> 01:30:50,624
And we use our
abilities for good!

1377
01:30:58,965 --> 01:31:00,601
Hm?

1378
01:31:07,775 --> 01:31:11,812
What? Has he gotten stronger?

1379
01:31:14,815 --> 01:31:16,517
Perhaps.

1380
01:31:16,650 --> 01:31:19,286
But something else
is different as well.

1381
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:21,455
His resistance is decreasing!

1382
01:31:21,589 --> 01:31:22,957
Yes!

1383
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:27,461
There must be a cap on what his
reflecting Quirk can take!

1384
01:31:27,595 --> 01:31:28,829
Good.

1385
01:31:30,698 --> 01:31:33,634
Simple, then.
I'll surpass that limit!

1386
01:31:46,480 --> 01:31:48,382
No, this can't be happening.

1387
01:31:48,516 --> 01:31:50,584
Have I reached my boundaries?

1388
01:31:50,718 --> 01:31:53,087
I didn't know such a thing
was even possible!

1389
01:31:53,220 --> 01:31:55,289
Because you gave up.

1390
01:31:57,791 --> 01:32:00,060
If you didn't lose hope...

1391
01:32:00,194 --> 01:32:02,730
If you kept trying...

1392
01:32:02,863 --> 01:32:07,201
You might have been able
to get along with people.

1393
01:32:07,334 --> 01:32:10,204
But instead, you decided
that powers are disease.

1394
01:32:10,337 --> 01:32:13,173
And chose to
wallow in self-pity.

1395
01:32:13,307 --> 01:32:16,143
You're a failure because
you stopped trying!

1396
01:32:16,277 --> 01:32:17,711
Be silent.

1397
01:32:17,845 --> 01:32:20,047
A hero knows what it means

1398
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:23,484
to keep fighting until the end.

1399
01:32:23,617 --> 01:32:25,119
Shut your mouth.

1400
01:32:25,252 --> 01:32:30,157
That's why we always remind
ourselves what we have to do.

1401
01:32:30,291 --> 01:32:32,793
You filth.

1402
01:32:32,927 --> 01:32:38,365
Go beyond! Plus Ultra!

1403
01:32:38,499 --> 01:32:40,401
Shut up!

1404
01:33:20,674 --> 01:33:23,310
Detroit Smash!

1405
01:33:52,107 --> 01:33:53,807
A real hero

1406
01:33:53,941 --> 01:33:58,046
will always find a way
for justice to be served!

1407
01:33:58,178 --> 01:34:02,316
I know, All Might.

1408
01:34:02,449 --> 01:34:04,785
Young Midoriya!

1409
01:34:04,918 --> 01:34:09,390
A hero has so much
to protect in this world.

1410
01:34:09,523 --> 01:34:12,359
Which is why...

1411
01:34:12,493 --> 01:34:14,361
Which is why...

1412
01:34:14,495 --> 01:34:16,664
...I will defeat you!

1413
01:35:01,475 --> 01:35:09,475
United States of World Smash!

1414
01:35:37,244 --> 01:35:40,647
You're... too late.

1415
01:35:55,529 --> 01:35:58,532
The countdown is over. But...

1416
01:35:58,665 --> 01:36:01,435
There's no explosion.

1417
01:36:01,568 --> 01:36:03,904
The bomb's not detonating.

1418
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:08,776
Did they disarm the bombs?

1419
01:36:08,909 --> 01:36:12,446
Yeah. That's a relief.

1420
01:36:17,985 --> 01:36:21,655
Well done. I'm so proud.

1421
01:36:43,710 --> 01:36:46,114
Thank you, Rody.

1422
01:36:46,247 --> 01:36:48,882
You hang in there, okay?
I'll get you to a hospital soon.

1423
01:36:49,017 --> 01:36:53,387
Deku. I did it, right?

1424
01:36:53,520 --> 01:36:55,622
I protected my family?

1425
01:36:55,756 --> 01:36:58,759
Just like my dad did.

1426
01:37:01,695 --> 01:37:04,932
And I stopped the bombs?

1427
01:37:05,066 --> 01:37:07,868
Yeah.

1428
01:37:08,001 --> 01:37:09,237
I didn't give up.

1429
01:37:09,369 --> 01:37:13,774
I saw it through
just like you would.

1430
01:37:13,907 --> 01:37:17,611
You did great.
You're amazing, Rody.

1431
01:37:22,217 --> 01:37:25,786
That's true. I am pretty cool.

1432
01:37:55,983 --> 01:37:58,062
The terrorist
attacks that shook the world

1433
01:37:58,086 --> 01:38:00,021
were successfully prevented
through the efforts

1434
01:38:00,154 --> 01:38:03,024
of multiple hero teams
working in tandem.

1435
01:38:03,157 --> 01:38:06,194
The members of Humarise,
the group behind the threat,

1436
01:38:06,327 --> 01:38:08,129
are being taken into custody.

1437
01:38:08,263 --> 01:38:10,664
Some from unexpected places.

1438
01:38:13,834 --> 01:38:15,502
The case was resolved

1439
01:38:15,636 --> 01:38:18,772
without a single new
Trigger Bomb exploding.

1440
01:38:18,906 --> 01:38:23,510
In the end, the heroes
protected this world.

1441
01:38:23,644 --> 01:38:26,747
But, it wasn't just
the pros and students.

1442
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:29,416
The one who really
saved everybody...

1443
01:38:29,549 --> 01:38:33,487
The one who gave
his all, was him.

1444
01:38:49,870 --> 01:38:50,870
Rody!

1445
01:38:50,971 --> 01:38:52,407
...Ha, ha!

1446
01:38:52,539 --> 01:38:53,984
Didn't think you'd
be out so soon! Heh.

1447
01:38:54,008 --> 01:38:56,777
Ah, they said I was
good to head back home.

1448
01:38:56,910 --> 01:38:58,379
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

1449
01:38:58,512 --> 01:39:00,948
Although, if I had
died stopping those bombs,

1450
01:39:01,082 --> 01:39:02,783
I would've become
a total legend.

1451
01:39:02,916 --> 01:39:04,356
That's a morbid thing to say!

1452
01:39:04,385 --> 01:39:08,256
...Hah!

1453
01:39:08,389 --> 01:39:09,690
So, hey.

1454
01:39:09,823 --> 01:39:11,368
Come up with any big
plans for the future?

1455
01:39:11,392 --> 01:39:14,594
Just going back to
my normal life for now.

1456
01:39:14,728 --> 01:39:16,830
Though, I suppose,
with all I've been through,

1457
01:39:16,964 --> 01:39:18,266
who knows what's
in store for me?

1458
01:39:21,535 --> 01:39:23,503
Right.

1459
01:39:24,205 --> 01:39:25,748
We will now begin boarding

1460
01:39:25,772 --> 01:39:29,043
for flight NNY224.

1461
01:39:29,177 --> 01:39:30,737
I gotta run and catch my flight.

1462
01:39:30,811 --> 01:39:33,181
Do me a solid
and stick to Japan, 'kay?

1463
01:39:33,314 --> 01:39:35,916
Nothing good happens
when you're around.

1464
01:39:36,050 --> 01:39:39,187
Probably best for everyone
if you stay in your lane.

1465
01:39:42,923 --> 01:39:46,760
I'll come back
and visit for sure.

1466
01:39:50,864 --> 01:39:52,766
Yeah, like I care.

1467
01:40:16,623 --> 01:40:19,260
Got a job for me, old man?

1468
01:40:19,394 --> 01:40:20,428
Like a real gig.

1469
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:22,596
Somethin' that's
more respectable.

1470
01:40:24,198 --> 01:40:26,833
One of my employees
did quit on me.

1471
01:40:26,967 --> 01:40:28,869
Guess you can help.

1472
01:40:31,538 --> 01:40:33,241
That is one possibility.

1473
01:40:33,805 --> 01:41:33,810
