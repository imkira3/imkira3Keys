<i>Lord of the Underworld,</i>

6
00:00:47,339 --> 00:00:50,593
<i>to create a cursed sword so powerful</i>

7
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:54,397
<i>that whoever possessed it
could rule the world.</i>

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,769
<i>Fueled by taking the souls of its enemies,</i>

9
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:03,151
<i>the sword was forged in the fires of hell</i>

10
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:05,733
<i>by the Lord of the Underworld,</i>

11

<i>condemned to never-ending darkness.</i>

17
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:31,426
<i>But if evil can be so easily
created in a fiery forge,</i>

18
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,601
<i>then surely, there must be

King Memtep?

30
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,076
Before you plunder the antiquities
of this tomb, you must know,

31
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,409
unleashing this evil that once was,

32
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,368
will come with a great price.

33
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:07,502
Power is not given, priestess.

34
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:09,086

Have your bird find
the Scorpion King, priestess.

52
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,820
The gods will grant you
your vengeance in time.

53
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,992

It's beautiful.

No, it's strong.

That's what counts.

59
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,381
With this, you can harvest the winter

61
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,636

Done with swords.

66
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,277

Listen to me, Abel.

Being a warrior is not what you think.

70
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,127
Swinging a sword in war
is a hard burden to bear.

71

No priests or gods can save you
from the savagery of battle.

My father told me that
you two had a great bond,

that if Nubia ever needed an ally,

with his hordes, enslaving, burning?

162
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,768
He wields a cursed sword, the Fang of Anubis.

It is a hidden text,

00:35:27,334 --> 00:35:29,297
"After you pass the moonstone threshold,

331
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,506
"take 400 paces just east of north."

332
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,181
This way!

333
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,917
What now?

334
00:36:06,331 --> 00:36:08,834
Don't rush me. It's my first time doing this.

335
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,058
Moon's rising.

336
00:36:39,114 --> 00:36:40,457
Let's do this, blacksmith.

337
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:56,092
The lenses must align with a cipher.
A combination.

338
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,549
What is it?

339
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,679
I'm looking.

340
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:06,850
"The one that repeats its form."

341
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,527
That's the cipher!

342
00:37:10,854 --> 00:37:12,447
"The one that repeats its form."

343
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,233
It's what's written on the gateway.

344
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,614
Let's go. It won't stay open for long.

345
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,433
What is that?

346
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,141
Quicksilver. Nature's guard against evil.

347
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:11,566
I hate quests.

348
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:32,337
Blacksmith, this way.

349
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,799
Tell me you know what
this magic book looks like.

350
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:30,562
It could be a scroll on vellum,
written in codex form,

351
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,931
perhaps a tome?

352
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,777
Maybe papyrus book scribbled in burnt bones.

353
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,107
So, you're saying you have no idea, right?

354
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,405
Yes, that is what I'm saying.

355
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:06,006
(GROWLING)

356
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,518
(GROWLS)

357
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,102
Kill intruder!

358
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:24,566
Ouch! No fair!

359
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,339
Enkidu! Enough!

360
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:14,116
These people opened the portal
with a lunar scroll.

361
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:15,784
They are not our foe.

362
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,369
They are armed!

363
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,334
One of them attacked me unfairly from behind.

364
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:24,292
I am sure they meant no harm.

365
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,002
(GRUMBLES)

366
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:31,887
I am Tala, daughter of Balthazar,
warrior of Nubia.

367
00:42:34,052 --> 00:42:36,020
We have come for the Book of Souls.

368
00:42:36,971 --> 00:42:38,189
Have you?

369
00:42:52,737 --> 00:42:54,705
And you've brought a brute?

370
00:42:56,324 --> 00:42:57,746
A barbarian?

371
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,166
You're Akkadian.

372
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:09,880
What is that thing?

373
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,969
(GRUNTS) I'm not a thing!

374
00:43:13,049 --> 00:43:14,095
A golem.

375
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:15,347
ENKIDU: Stupid human.

376
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:20,807
Enkidu is formed from clay,
brought to life by magic.

377
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,396
My father made him to be my protector.

378
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:25,570
I have the strength of 10 men.

379
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:32,489
Maybe 20.

380
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:33,870
(GRUNTS)

381
00:43:41,911 --> 00:43:46,041
I bet you wouldn't sell her for five
pigs and some pomegranate wine.

382
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,843
Barbarian.

383
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:02,314
(LAUGHING) Pretty human.

384
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,249
So you've come for the Book of Souls?

385
00:44:28,124 --> 00:44:29,170
TALA: Yes.

386
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:30,843
My people are in peril.

387
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,632
We need it to vanquish a warlord
who leads his army across Egypt.

388
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,551
He carries a cursed sword.

389
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:40,186
None can stand against it.

390
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:44,602
I have nothing on how
to defeat a cursed sword.

391
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,185
But the legend says the book is here.

392
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:51,816
You must help us. We are running out of time.

393
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:53,866
I'm sorry.

394
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,152
There is nothing here for you.

395
00:44:57,987 --> 00:44:59,990
The book is here?

396
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,702
I have many scrolls, Akkadian.

397
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:08,085
Some codices, some tomes.

398
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:12,176
I have read them all,
committed them to memory,

399
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:16,013
but I have not a single book.

400
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:23,225
Tala, what does your scroll
say about this Book of Souls?

401
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:32,197
The scroll says, "The Book of Souls
is written on vellum of alabaster.

402
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:37,194
"The body of its forbidden text is
uncovered in the blue light of the moon."

403
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:58,423
"Vellum, of alabaster.

404
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,268
"The body of its forbidden text

405
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,149
"is uncovered only
in the blue light of the moon."

406
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:10,397
Enkidu!

407
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:12,444
No!

408
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,114
It's...

409
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,114
You.

410
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,196
You are the Book of Souls.

411
00:47:03,362 --> 00:47:06,161
The moonlight reveals the text?

412
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:08,955
Yes.

413
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:15,716
It is revealed on the third moon
in a season of four moons.

414
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,883
Seven times in the 19-year Metonic cycle.

415
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,593
What's written here?

416
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:28,601
Names of souls taken by a sword
forged in the Underworld by Anubis.

417
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,481
Do you know who they are?

418
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,316
Yes.

419
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,733
With every soul the sword takes,

420
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:39,149
I can hear their screams,

421
00:47:40,149 --> 00:47:41,526
see their faces.

422
00:47:46,781 --> 00:47:49,125
Some fates are worse than death.

423
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,344
(HORSES GALLOPING)

424
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:48,726
I have no quarrel with you, Chieftain Uruk.

425
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,556
I seek the Book of Souls

426
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,684
in the Valley of the 13th Moon.

427
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:57,436
Your jackal bellies are never full, are they?

428
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:03,150
Whatever the Akkadian paid
for passage, King Nebserek will triple it.

429
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,741
He paid with courage and respect.

430
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,077
Give us passage and you will be spared.

431
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:14,252
Stand your ground and I will crush you.

432
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:23,219
We are People of the Sand.

433
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:26,760
Sand cannot be crushed.

434
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:30,013
It can only change its form.

435
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,222
(CHEERING)

436
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:47,948
You're going to pay for that.

437
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:50,742
That was my favorite table.

438
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,740
(GRUNTS) That was my only table.

439
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:54,537
You shouldn't have broke it, then.

440
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:56,411
Puny human.

441
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:58,872
My father was a great Sumerian mage.

442
00:49:59,288 --> 00:50:01,757
He brought me here before I could even walk.

443
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:04,588
He told me very little about my curse.

444
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:07,342
You have no idea how to defeat this curse?

445
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:12,177
The sword was found in King Memtep's
tomb beneath a city called Amonesh.

446
00:50:12,676 --> 00:50:14,929
Your quest must take you there.

447
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:19,142
The secret lies within King Memtep's tomb.

448
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:24,029
All right, then.

449
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,367
We will go to Amonesh, and break this curse.

450
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:34,033
First command! Keep Amina here, forever.

451
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:36,284
(GRUNTS)

452
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,547
I hate this puny human.

453
00:50:46,627 --> 00:50:49,426
There's a trade route that leads
to the city of Aqaba.

454
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,882
There is a port here.

455
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:54,388
You can hire a boat to cross
the sea to Amonesh.

456
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,220
(GRUMBLES) Amina likes him.

457
00:50:56,637 --> 00:50:58,685
- This life...
- ENKIDU: He's ugly.

458
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,391
Must be hard to bear.

459
00:51:01,767 --> 00:51:03,940
I have escaped the pain of the living.

460
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,738
And the joys?

461
00:51:07,690 --> 00:51:08,737
Yes.

462
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,073
It is more a burden than a blessing.

463
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,077
He's got muscles, but I fight muscles...

464
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:18,784
Come with us into the world.

465
00:51:19,827 --> 00:51:23,876
There is nothing more I would love than
to see your world through my own eyes.

466
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:25,959
ENKIDU: A man of puny flesh.

467
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:30,255
But I'm afraid that's not possible.

468
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,549
And if I can make it possible?

469
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,350
ENKIDU:
He's got muscles, but I fight muscles.

470
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:40,726
I think I found a shorter route...

471
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,478
No fire, no fire!

472
00:51:42,558 --> 00:51:45,403
- Put it out! Put it out!
- ENKIDU: No fire! No fire!

473
00:51:45,686 --> 00:51:48,108
It's gone. Enkidu, don't be afraid.

474
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,401
Don't be afraid.

475
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:50,903
- Fire's gone?
- Yes.

476
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:54,070
- I forgot to tell them.
- And I'm still here?

477
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:55,867
Calm yourself, Enkidu.

478
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,786
I hate fire.

479
00:52:01,869 --> 00:52:03,246
Enkidu cannot abide fire,

480
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,043
- not even the smallest of flames.
- I hate it.

481
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,500
ENKIDU: Fire. I hate it.

482
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:12,384
It's okay.

483
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,097
ENKIDU: Stupid humans!

484
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:31,862
They are too far ahead of us.
We need to split up.

485
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:35,281
There's only two ways out of that valley,

486
00:52:35,361 --> 00:52:37,364
and we'll shut them both off.

487
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:39,785
Ride the Silk Road to where
the dunes meet the sea.

488
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:43,745
We have been riding all night.
The men, the horses, they need rest.

489
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:47,415
You will ride until the horses hearts
stop beating in their chests,

490
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,758
and then you will go on foot,

491
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,593
crawling if you must,

492
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,338

01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:32,096
That's where the sword was found.

660
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,894
It would have been separated.

661
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:35,976
Everything's been plundered and robbed.

662
01:14:40,184 --> 01:14:41,231
The Sphinx.

663
01:14:44,146 --> 01:14:46,490
An idol full of secrets and mystery.

664
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,030
The guardian of knowledge.

665
01:14:52,363 --> 01:14:54,331
The Sphinx dies for truth,

666
01:14:54,448 --> 01:14:56,576
but this is an androsphinx,

667
01:14:57,034 --> 01:15:01,756
the male of the species, known
as the messenger of truth.

668
01:15:04,709 --> 01:15:05,756
Break it open.

669
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:18,231
I'll give it right back.

670
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,394
No!

671
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:22,813
Enkidu, I'll bring it back. I promise.

672
01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:24,065
Bring it back!

673
01:16:07,063 --> 01:16:09,191
MATHAYUS: It's a history written in Sumerian.

674
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,491
Yes.

675
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:15,200
AMINA: These hieroglyphs say King Memtep
was beset by enemies on all sides.

676
01:16:15,446 --> 01:16:17,699
<i>He called out to the God of the Underworld,</i>

677
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,661
<i>who forged a sword to steal
the souls of his enemies,</i>

678
01:16:20,785 --> 01:16:24,289
<i>giving King Memtep strength
and power beyond measure.</i>

679
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:26,916
<i>And the king grew terrible in his might,</i>

680
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:28,546
for he was cursed,

681
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:31,926
<i>and tormented by the screams
of the tortured souls.</i>

682
01:16:32,838 --> 01:16:35,216
King Memtep returned to Amonesh to find

683
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:38,347
<i>his royal concubine had birthed a girl child.</i>

684
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:42,057
<i>His daughter's skin bore the names
of those slain by the sword.</i>

685
01:16:42,848 --> 01:16:44,437
<i>Anubis told King Memtep</i>

686
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:46,605
<i>the only way to end the curse</i>

687
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:48,983
<i>was to destroy the Book
of Souls with the sword.</i>

688
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:52,278
<i>It was the god's cruel trick
that to save himself,</i>

689
01:16:52,358 --> 01:16:55,781
<i>the king must end the curse
by killing his only daughter.</i>

690
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,615
<i>But a powerful mage saved the girl,</i>

691
01:16:59,073 --> 01:17:01,326
stealing her away forever,

692
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:04,332
and King Memtep went mad from the curse,

693
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:07,082
<i>driving the sword into his own heart,</i>

694
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:11,382
so entering his own name
into the Book of Souls.

695
01:17:18,676 --> 01:17:20,679
King Memtep was your father.

696
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:27,477
The mage I thought
was my father raised me as his own.

697
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:31,647
He meant to protect me.

698
01:17:31,981 --> 01:17:34,653
That's impossible. That would make you...

699
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,610
I have lived for centuries,

700
01:17:38,362 --> 01:17:41,286
and I will live for countless millennia more.

701
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:46,454
The only way to break
the curse of Anubis is to...

702
01:17:48,455 --> 01:17:50,674
I must be destroyed by the sword.

703
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:57,007
The Book of Souls must be
destroyed and the souls freed.

704
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,928
And I am the Book of Souls.

705
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:07,567
The Book of Souls, hidden
in the body of a beautiful woman.

706
01:18:16,275 --> 01:18:17,322
(GRUNTS)

707
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:32,884
Men are simple, aren't they?

708
01:19:10,246 --> 01:19:12,089
The Scorpion King.

709
01:20:08,887 --> 01:20:10,601
I've sedated him.

710
01:20:10,681 --> 01:20:14,606
This is the Scorpion King
everyone whispers about.

711
01:20:15,144 --> 01:20:17,272
Legends always start with a whisper.

712
01:20:28,866 --> 01:20:32,917
Hmm, he doesn't look like
very much in these chains.

713
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:35,381
Before I take his head off his shoulders,

714
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,259
let us see how he fights.

715
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:44,468
Alert me when he wakes from his slumber.

716
01:20:44,548 --> 01:20:46,221
Are you sure this is wise?

717
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,515
Kill him now and be done with it.

718
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:53,811
He's already half-dead, priestess.

719
01:20:54,183 --> 01:20:58,108
Half-dead men are dangerous,
especially a man like this.

720
01:20:58,228 --> 01:21:02,950
The jackals want to see
this great warrior killed in battle.

721
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:06,529
We must satiate their bloodlust.

722
01:21:09,740 --> 01:21:13,040
He is weak and wounded

723
01:21:15,454 --> 01:21:17,331
and no match for the sword!

724
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:29,972
No!

725
01:21:36,141 --> 01:21:37,233
Princess Tala.

726
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:45,451
I am your queen now.

727
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,915
If called, are the men ready to fight?

728
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:53,784
The men will fight, my queen.

729
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:01,379
What is this?

730
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:03,465
The Book of Souls.

731
01:22:05,462 --> 01:22:07,339
Written on ancient vellum,

732
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:12,227
illuminated in the blue light
of the evening sun.

733
01:22:13,637 --> 01:22:15,059
Such beauty.

734
01:22:16,723 --> 01:22:19,477
So, you thought to defeat me

735
01:22:19,977 --> 01:22:23,857
by destroying the sword,
and with it my power?

736
01:22:34,491 --> 01:22:36,744
I see you're a book with a will of your own.

737
01:22:38,162 --> 01:22:41,917
Such contempt in your eyes.

738
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:46,382
Burn the bitch.

739
01:23:23,207 --> 01:23:25,005
TALA: Rise, blacksmith.

740
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,007
Become the Scorpion King again.

741
01:23:29,338 --> 01:23:31,181
MENNOFER: We honor the covenant

742
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,935
between the God of the Underworld, Anubis,

743
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:37,391
and the bearer of his sword,

744
01:23:37,471 --> 01:23:39,393
our god-king Nebserek.

745
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:43,854
Nebserek! Nebserek! Nebserek!

746
01:23:43,936 --> 01:23:46,775
MENNOFER: Here on this sacred ground,

747
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:50,320
we gather at the sacrificial fires

748
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,822
to put forth...

749
01:23:52,277 --> 01:23:55,156
TALA: Remember who you are, Scorpion King,

750
01:23:55,322 --> 01:23:58,201
demigod, the last Akkadian.

751
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:39,575
(ROCK CRUMBLING)

752
01:24:46,540 --> 01:24:48,128
MENNOFER: ...written in the prophesies,

753
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:51,303
The Book of Souls shall burn
and be thus destroyed.

754
01:24:51,837 --> 01:24:53,714
Let no man stand against us!

755
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,390
I am one man!

756
01:24:59,511 --> 01:25:01,263
But one can stand against many,

757
01:25:04,725 --> 01:25:06,068
for a friend.

758
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:11,823
(GRUNTING)

759
01:25:15,652 --> 01:25:17,620
Calm your blades, jackals.

760
01:25:20,365 --> 01:25:21,742
He's mine!

761
01:25:30,667 --> 01:25:33,216
How was your sleep, Scorpion King?

762
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,256
I'm just a blacksmith.

763
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:39,893
I admire a man who stands tall,

764
01:25:40,302 --> 01:25:42,225
even when he's overmatched.

765
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:46,144
The time for chanting has not yet come.

766
01:25:46,224 --> 01:25:48,397
Enkidu, it's time.

767
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:50,646
- NEBSEREK: The people want...
- I did not protect Amina.

768
01:25:50,729 --> 01:25:52,197
I failed her.

769
01:25:53,231 --> 01:25:54,858
We have not failed.

770
01:25:55,567 --> 01:25:57,786
- Not yet.
- NEBSEREK: He threatens my reign.

771
01:26:00,739 --> 01:26:03,743
You stand on the ruins of my people,

772
01:26:04,618 --> 01:26:08,248
broken many years ago
by your Akkadian empire.

773
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:11,879
We were forced to live like jackals,

774
01:26:12,209 --> 01:26:13,882
eating scraps to survive.

775
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,589
But one jackal

776
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:19,425
was not prepared to slink away,

777
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:23,308
and grow old, starving and defeated!

778
01:26:34,731 --> 01:26:36,324
I dug deep,

779
01:26:37,025 --> 01:26:40,370
deep into the sand and found the one thing

780
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:42,580
that can rebuild an empire

781
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:46,292
ruled by an eater of souls.

782
01:26:46,493 --> 01:26:50,123
With this sword, I am invincible!

783
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:53,709
ALL: (CHANTING) Nebserek! Nebserek! Nebserek!

784
01:26:53,959 --> 01:26:55,586
You fear no man.

785
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,213
I fear no man.

786
01:26:58,296 --> 01:26:59,889
I have faith in you, Enkidu.

787
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:02,680
Show me who you are.

788
01:27:03,802 --> 01:27:05,679
This is your time.

789
01:27:05,929 --> 01:27:08,023
This is your moment!

790
01:27:08,390 --> 01:27:10,859
- Amina needs you!
- (GRUNTS)

791
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:15,572
On my command, unleash hell.

792
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,779
Nebserek! Nebserek! Nebserek!

793
01:27:36,168 --> 01:27:37,295
No!

794
01:27:51,892 --> 01:27:53,769
You must believe!

795
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:57,356
I cannot burn!

796
01:27:57,898 --> 01:27:59,736
You cannot burn!

797
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:01,819
Break it down!

798
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:04,905
ENKIDU: <i>Amina! I'm coming!</i>

(SCREAMING)

800
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:21,527
Give me your soul, Akkadian!

801
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,116
Never.

802
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,673
AMINA: Enkidu!

803
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:47,553
I cannot fail.

804
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,220
Must destroy sword!

805
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:58,895
- I cannot...
- No!

806
01:29:58,977 --> 01:30:01,321
Fail!

807
01:30:07,569 --> 01:30:08,696
Amina!

808
01:30:27,714 --> 01:30:29,387
(SCREAMS)

809
01:31:11,091 --> 01:31:16,016
If I can't have your soul, Akkadian,
then I will send you to the afterlife.

810
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,643
No, I create my destiny,

811
01:31:18,723 --> 01:31:21,313
and I will not die by your hand.

812
01:31:21,393 --> 01:31:23,566
But you will!

813
01:31:40,203 --> 01:31:41,705
No!

814
01:33:30,438 --> 01:33:33,192
Break this curse, Scorpion King.

815
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:50,542
I won't hurt you.

816
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:53,219
The evil will not rest.

817
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:58,474
It will come for the sword again and again.

818
01:34:03,930 --> 01:34:07,230
I am the sacrifice that must be made,

819
01:34:07,684 --> 01:34:10,529
to destroy the sword and free the souls.

820
01:34:16,401 --> 01:34:17,903
I'm not afraid.

821
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:23,416
Is there no other way?

822
01:34:46,639 --> 01:34:49,017
Thank you for showing me your world.
