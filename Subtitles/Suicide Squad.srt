that I would just, you know, go,

1783
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:06,234
without killing them all.

1784
02:02:06,400 --> 02:02:07,549
Bring it in.

1785
02:02:10,880 --> 02:02:12,074
I love you, Daddy.

1786

Hmm.

1787
02:02:14,920 --> 02:02:16,114
I love you.

Hey! Let me out!

Let me out of here right now!

1791
02:02:46,800 --> 02:02:49,758
Hey! You feel that? Yeah.

1792
02:02:50,640 --> 02:02:52,551
Let me out of here, darling, please.

1793
02:02:52,760 --> 02:02:54,096
Please, I'm begging you, seriously.

1794
02:02:54,120 --> 02:02:57,430
Listen to me. Have you got a car?
Because I'm a brilliant driver.

1795
02:02:57,640 --> 02:02:58,993
Come on!

AMANDA: This is crown jewels here,
Mr. Wayne.

1805
02:06:27,360 --> 02:06:29,316
And you do understand my legal exposure.

1806
02:06:29,480 --> 02:06:31,516
If anyone knew what I procured for you...

1807
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:34,877
Listen, I can keep a secret, okay?

1808
02:06:35,040 --> 02:06:36,268
What do you want?

1809
02:06:36,480 --> 02:06:39,040
People are asking questions
about Midway City.

1810
02:06:39,200 --> 02:06:40,880
The kind of people
who can get the answers.

1811
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,997
And if they can get those answers,
my head will be on a pike.

1812
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:46,794
Consider yourself under my protection.

1813

If you deliver.

1814
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:05,999
Why, Mr. Wayne?

1815

You believe in friendship.
I believe in leverage.

Good night.

1820
02:07:17,640 --> 02:07:19,631
You look tired.

1821
02:07:19,800 --> 02:07:21,916
You should stop working nights.

1822

You should shut it down,
or my friends and I'll do it for you.
