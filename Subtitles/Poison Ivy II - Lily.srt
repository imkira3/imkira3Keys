00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,833
Donald.

3
00:01:44,837 --> 00:01:46,437
Catherine...

4
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,145
This just isn't working out, all right?

5
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:52,136
â™ª <i>Never been a day â™ª
â™ª when I doubt for a moment</i> â™ª

6
00:02:52,138 --> 00:02:57,276
â™ª <i>Maybe once or twice â™ª
â™ª ain't so bad</i> â™ª

7
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:59,377
â™ª <i>But deep inside, â™ª
â™ª I always knew</i> â™ª

8
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:02,214
â™ª <i>My time would â™ª
â™ª come my way, sure</i> â™ª

9
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,545
â™ª <i>Now it's on me â™ª
â™ª to make it last</i> â™ª

10
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:11,257
â™ª <i>There's nothing â™ª
â™ª I won't do</i> â™ª

11
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:16,828
â™ª <i>Nothing I won't try</i> â™ª

12
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,865
â™ª <i>For a change â™ª
â™ª to something new</i> â™ª

13
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:22,334
â™ª <i>Ain't no excuse</i> â™ª

14
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:31,305
â™ª <i>There's nothing... â™ª
â™ª Yeah, I won't do</i> â™ª

15
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:34,481
â™ª <i>Nothing I won't do</i> â™ª

16
00:03:37,149 --> 00:03:40,018
â™ª <i>For a change â™ª
â™ª to something new</i> â™ª

17
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,519
â™ª <i>What's there to lose?</i> â™ª

18
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:46,858
â™ª <i>There's nothing... â™ª
â™ª I won't do</i> â™ª

19
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:49,459
You see, it doesn't matter

20
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:52,062
whether it's painting or sculpture

21
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,074
or computer-generated graphics.

22
00:03:54,075 --> 00:03:56,066
And it doesn't matter

23
00:03:56,068 --> 00:03:59,068
what style you choose to work in,

24
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,671
whether it's Neo-primitivism

25
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,083
or romantic realism or postmodern
deconstructionism.

26
00:04:03,084 --> 00:04:04,605
The same rules apply.

27
00:04:04,611 --> 00:04:07,679
Everything is governed
by the laws of nature,

28
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,716
and nowhere are the principles
of proportion

29
00:04:10,717 --> 00:04:14,686
more perfectly manifested
than in the human form.

30
00:04:14,687 --> 00:04:16,617
Excuse me.

31
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:19,024
Um, is this the, uh...

32
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,225
Life study.

33
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,727
Wait a minute. Don't tell me.

34
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,096
Let me guess.

35
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,727
Lily leonetti.

36
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,869
You're 2 weeks and 30 minutes late.

37
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,638
Sorry. Family emergency.

38
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,506
It's all right. Come on in.

39
00:04:34,507 --> 00:04:36,907
You can get set up over here.

40
00:04:36,909 --> 00:04:38,979
I don't think Catherine's coming back.

41
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,714
All right, let's try
to stay focused, folks.

42
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:46,115
I'm talking about learning the rules

43
00:04:46,118 --> 00:04:47,918
before you break them...

44
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,520
Specifically, perspective and proportion

45
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:55,126
as it relates to the human body.

46
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:59,067
Which brings us back to Isabel.

47
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:04,135
So, see if you can discover

48
00:05:04,136 --> 00:05:05,536
the hidden truths

49
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:07,768
in the shadows and the light.

50
00:05:07,774 --> 00:05:10,314
Translate what you see through your arms

51
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:12,744
and fingertips onto the page.

52
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,145
Hi.

53
00:05:14,146 --> 00:05:15,746
Hi.

54
00:06:11,203 --> 00:06:13,405
Is this 508 alta?

55
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:14,606
Yep.

56
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,476
â™ª <i>She could tell by the way</i> â™ª

57
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:21,177
â™ª <i>The light hit your face...</i> â™ª

58
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,948
I'm gredin.

59
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:24,816
I'm Lily.

60
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,817
I know.

61
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,561
Thank you.

62
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:37,428
Follow me.

63
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:45,435
The entrance is in the back.

64
00:07:12,264 --> 00:07:13,874
Bye, Lily.

65
00:07:41,894 --> 00:07:42,804
Yes?

66
00:07:42,805 --> 00:07:45,564
I'm Lily, the new roommate.

67
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,765
Oh, you're here.

68
00:07:48,768 --> 00:07:50,435
Yeah.

69
00:07:50,436 --> 00:07:52,136
I'm Tanya, by the way.

70
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,668
Hi.

71
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:58,184
Um, anything in this cupboard is mine.

72
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:02,714
And the living room is off limits

73
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:04,515
because that's where I practice.

74
00:08:04,517 --> 00:08:07,717
Bridgette, Lily.

75
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,220
English major, right?

76
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:12,121
No. Art. Painting.

77
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,026
That's funny. I never would have guessed.

78
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:19,127
Well, I can see we're
off to a good start.

79
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,899
Ha ha ha!

80
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,540
Come on.

81
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,779
â™ª <i>I wish you were here</i> â™ª

82
00:08:33,512 --> 00:08:36,915
â™ª <i>I wish you were here</i> â™ª

83
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:39,816
â™ª <i>God, god, I...</i> â™ª

84
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,249
â™ª <i>Wish you were here</i> â™ª

85
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,064
â™ª <i>I wish you were here</i> â™ª

86
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:53,364
Is she always like that?

87
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:55,365
Unfortunately, yes.

88
00:08:55,367 --> 00:08:57,367
What about that guy gredin?

89
00:08:57,369 --> 00:08:58,939
Oh, gredin's really cool

90
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,768
and an amazing sculptor.

91
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:02,574
And that's Robert,

92
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,135
a major talent.

93
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,993
Well, here we are.

94
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:17,789
It's not exactly the bel aire.

95
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:22,390
In fact, it's not even the ramada.

96
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:23,795
It's nice.

97
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:26,665
Where did you say you were from again?

98
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,796
Michigan.

99
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,801
Oh. First time to I.A.?

100
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:34,539
First time anywhere, really.

101
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,009
Well, the world of bytes is calling.

102
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,280
Got to run.

103
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:44,395
Hello.

104
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:46,404
How's I.A., kiddo?

105
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:48,405
Hi, dad. It's good.

106
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:49,807
It's nice.

107
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,809
Well, this place feels
pretty empty without you.

108
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,014
Hold on. Your mom wants to talk to you.

109
00:11:56,015 --> 00:11:57,015
O.k.

110
00:11:57,016 --> 00:11:57,816
Lily?

111
00:11:57,817 --> 00:11:58,984
Hi, mom.

112
00:11:58,985 --> 00:12:01,145
Did you find the surprise?

113
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,163
Hold on a sec.

114
00:12:12,765 --> 00:12:15,095
What is it?

115
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,568
It's just a little something

116
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:19,439
to remind you of us.

117
00:12:20,572 --> 00:12:22,307
You know, I don't know why

118
00:12:22,308 --> 00:12:24,838
you have to go all the way to I.A.

119
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:26,077
To be an artist.

120
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,446
We could have bought you a car

121
00:12:28,447 --> 00:12:29,977
if you went to state.

122
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:31,352
Mary Jane, Katherine's daughter,

123
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:34,250
she went to state, and she's very happy

124
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,255
making all sorts of arts and crafts.

125
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:40,856
Mom, do we have to have
this conversation again?

126
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,060
Where's daddy?

127
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:44,262
Bob!

128
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,865
Oh, he's gone off somewhere.

129
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:49,866
O.k., well, um, I got to go.

130
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,869
Go? We just got on.

131
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,271
Mom, I'm going to be late for class.

132
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,476
O.k., well, will we see
you at Thanksgiving?

133
00:12:58,477 --> 00:13:00,277
I don't know yet, mom.

134
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,479
I haven't looked at my schedule.

135
00:13:02,481 --> 00:13:03,881
Lily!

136
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,683
I'll try, o.K.?

137
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:07,685
Bye. Don't forget to call me.

138
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,086
Bye.

139
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,496
That's Peter the performance artist,

140
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,698
or as he likes to refer to it...

141
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,369
Self as show.

142
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,104
Someday, with any luck,

143
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:48,705
somebody will put him out of his misery.

144
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:37,222
Look at her, Lily. What do you see?

145
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:44,758
I see... A face... And a body.

146
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,773
And what else?

147
00:17:49,168 --> 00:17:51,168
I see a naked woman.

148
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:53,770
Right. The whole naked woman,

149
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,640
not just parts.

150
00:17:55,641 --> 00:17:58,309
Not just the head...

151
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:02,710
Get that... So let's go...

152
00:18:02,714 --> 00:18:05,616
Include the breast...

153
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:07,585
And the waist,

154
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,355
the leg, and the whole thing.

155
00:18:10,356 --> 00:18:12,616
Get it all on the page.

156
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,994
Just keep going over and over again,

157
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,161
and eventually...

158
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:18,402
Technique will give way to expression.

159
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
Thank you.

160
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:25,202
Or expression...

161
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:28,414
Will give way to expression.

162
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:34,212
You have some thoughts
you'd like to share with us?

163
00:18:34,213 --> 00:18:37,553
Me? Thoughts? Share?

164
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,219
No. I couldn't possibly.

165
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:44,820
I'm here to listen and learn,

166
00:18:44,823 --> 00:18:46,491
copy and conform.

167
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,861
From this masterpiece
you've just created,

168
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:51,000
it's obvious
that you've transcended all need

169
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:52,556
for traditional forms.

170
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:54,874
No.

171
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,237
This, my fellow students, was created

172
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:02,838
out of no other tradition
but that of boredom.

173
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,345
This... this is an a-plus.

174
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:17,222
This is a perfect example

175
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:20,658
of 100% surrender to the process

176
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:22,659
of tradition.

177
00:19:22,661 --> 00:19:24,461
It's so lifelike

178
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,903
that you could almost fuck it.

179
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,874
You through?

180
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,275
Can we get back to work?

181
00:19:51,022 --> 00:19:52,622
Jackass.

182
00:20:02,768 --> 00:20:04,034
Lily?

183
00:20:04,035 --> 00:20:06,305
You o.K.?

184
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:08,766
Yeah.

185
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,922
Lily?

186
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,325
Yeah?

187
00:20:27,326 --> 00:20:29,326
Can I come in?

188
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:31,328
No. I'm not dressed.

189
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,730
I'm sorry about earlier.

190
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,942
It had nothing to do with you.

211

Hello.

212
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,118
Hello. Lily leonetti?

213
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,520
Yeah.

214
00:23:43,522 --> 00:23:45,522
I understand you're looking

215
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:47,734
for a babysitting job.

216
00:23:48,794 --> 00:23:51,434
Bridgette! Shut that shit off!

217
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:54,431
Bridgette!

218
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,435
I'm going to kill her.

219
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,437
You want to help? Good.

220
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:03,239
I was thinking fat pills.

221
00:24:03,241 --> 00:24:06,441
She's always saying
if she gains one more pound,

222
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,054
she's going to kill herself.

223
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,446
Suicide's very good.

224
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:11,447
Thank you. Thank you very much.

225
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,049
Hey, you know what?

226
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:14,051
What?

227
00:24:14,052 --> 00:24:15,452
I got a job.

228
00:24:15,453 --> 00:24:17,054
Doing what?

229
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:17,855
Babysitting.

230
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:20,056
Well, how totally sweet.

231
00:24:20,058 --> 00:24:21,058
Hey!

232
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,659
It is.

233
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:28,866
She hates me. I'm an insensitive male.

234
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:30,867
You two know each other?

235
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:35,669
We do, but she might not
want to know me now.

236
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:40,044
Tell her I'm not half bad, Tanya.

237
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:44,075
I wish I were half
as good as you, gredin.

238
00:24:46,685 --> 00:24:49,085
Come on. I'll make it up to you.

239
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,088
Nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?

240
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,309
I got carried away with Donald.

241
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:16,914
I shouldn't have put you
in the middle of it.

242
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,915
Yeah, well, I probably overreacted.

243
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,917
I can sometimes be hypersensitive.

244
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,520
You shouldn't be. You got it.

245
00:25:25,523 --> 00:25:29,927
Yeah. I'm the only person in class

246
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:34,128
whose hand the teacher
has to hold... literally.

247
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,534
Well, falk has a weakness

248
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:39,535
for his female undergrads,

249
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:41,737
especially when they look like you.

250
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,941
What is this?

251
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:47,144
This is my magical crap.

252
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,745
I'm sort of hoping

253
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:51,277
it will win me a guggenheim.

254
00:25:51,282 --> 00:25:54,151
You'll get it.

255
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:57,154
You psychic?

256
00:25:57,155 --> 00:25:59,755
No. You deserve it.

257
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,189
So where were you

258
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,964
the first two weeks?

259
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,967
Well... when I applied,

260
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,168
I never thought I'd get accepted.

261
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,571
Then I was,

262
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:18,008
and I just freaked.

263
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,978
No big family emergency.

264
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:25,179
Just my own little private one.

265
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,193
That's all.

266
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:29,986
That's enough.

267
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,588
You, uh, see that hill over there?

268
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:34,991
Mm-hmm.

269
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:37,995
That's Beverly Hills. That's my home.

270
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,996
Might as well be timbuktu.

271
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,600
My father and I... we don't talk anymore.

272
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:00,616
What are you thinking?

273
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,948
I'm making a wish.

274
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:08,225
What are you wishing?

275
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,026
That I could just...

276
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:15,229
Open my eyes and be different.

277
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:19,235
Listen to me.

278
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,237
I'm listening.

279
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:30,846
And I like doing that.

280
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,650
You're beautiful.

281
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,654
No, I'm not.

282
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,055
Yes, you are.

283
00:27:40,058 --> 00:27:44,858
You're sweet, you're beautiful...

284
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,274
And different.

285
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:58,875

Maybe.

00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:57,974
Hey there.

334
00:32:57,975 --> 00:32:59,575
Hi.

335
00:33:00,978 --> 00:33:02,978
Well, what do you think?

336
00:33:04,115 --> 00:33:05,575
It's, uh...

337
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:09,194
Intense. Ha ha!

338
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:24,399
Either something very
tragic or terribly exciting

339
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:26,602
is happening in your life.

340
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:35,379
Women only change their hair
when it's one of the two.

341
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,780
Oh.

342
00:33:36,781 --> 00:33:38,781
I don't know.

343
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:41,585
I... i think I was just bored.

344
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,616
I bet it was something exciting.

345
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:44,688
Like what?

346
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,489
I confess. I'm not
really a fortuneteller.

347
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,026
You have a pretty face.

348
00:33:50,027 --> 00:33:51,427
You shouldn't hide it

349
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,029
behind that new hair style.

350
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:54,630
Donald?

351
00:33:54,632 --> 00:33:55,572
Hey.

352
00:33:55,573 --> 00:33:58,766
Hey! I thought I'd find you here.

353
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:00,569
Lily, meet Angela, my wife.

354
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:03,511
Angela, this is Lily,
your new babysitter.

355
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,705
Hi. Nice to meet you, Lily.

356
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:11,254
12 Mississippi.

357
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:14,717
13 Mississippi.

358
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,060
14 Mississippi.

359
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,058
15 Mississippi.

360
00:34:26,063 --> 00:34:27,764
I'm ready!

361
00:34:27,765 --> 00:34:30,665
16 Mississippi.

362
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:33,068
Lily, hurry up!

363
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:35,670
17, 18,

364
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:38,283
19, 20!

365
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,678
Daphna.

366
00:34:44,081 --> 00:34:47,081
Oh, daphna.

367
00:34:59,364 --> 00:35:01,531
Boo!

368
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,066
Aah!

369
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,467
Gotcha.

370
00:35:04,469 --> 00:35:06,469
Oh, I must say, daphna.

371
00:35:06,471 --> 00:35:08,671
You are a great hider.

372
00:35:08,673 --> 00:35:10,073
Thank you.

373
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:11,714
Oh, you're welcome.

374
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,245
Those are pictures
of daddy's old paintings.

375
00:35:17,248 --> 00:35:19,878
He doesn't like to paint anymore.

376
00:35:24,121 --> 00:35:25,721
Why?

377
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:30,727
Mamma says it's because painting
makes him crazy.

378
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:32,728
Ha ha ha!

379
00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:37,133
Daphna?

380
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,135
I'm going to hide again.

381
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,636
Oh, wait, daphna.

382
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,835
Hi.

383
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,481
Hi.

384
00:35:51,148 --> 00:35:52,748
Hello!

385
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,152
Hello?

386
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:57,621
Hi.

387
00:35:57,622 --> 00:35:58,888
Hi, sweetie.

388
00:35:58,889 --> 00:36:00,189
Hi. Hi, Lily.

389
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,631
Hi.

390
00:36:02,427 --> 00:36:04,427
What you been up to?

391
00:36:04,429 --> 00:36:06,629
Oh, I did the portrait.

392
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:07,764
All right.

393
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,765
Angela's getting back
into her photography.

394
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,367
She always said she'd give
daphna four years,

395
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,638
but lucky daphna got a full seven.

396
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,105
Ha ha ha!

397
00:36:16,106 --> 00:36:17,506
Right.

398
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:20,138
Why don't you take Lily home?

399
00:36:20,144 --> 00:36:21,545
Mom! I'm hiding!

400
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:24,176
No one's come to find me!

401
00:36:24,181 --> 00:36:25,581
Bye, Lily.

402
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,884
I'll give you a lift.

403
00:36:27,885 --> 00:36:29,885
Now from I.A.'s best station

404
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,487
for the sound of jazz,
another 30 minutes...

405
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,790
So... ha ha ha!

406
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:39,195
Why don't you tell me

407
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:41,196
a little bit about yourself, Lily?

408
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:43,798
Where was it you said you were from?

409
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,401
You'll laugh.

410
00:36:48,205 --> 00:36:50,205
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

411
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,807
Ha ha!

412
00:36:51,809 --> 00:36:53,209
Born and bred...

413
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,078
And stifled.

414
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,347
Well, that's a big move, huh?

415
00:36:57,348 --> 00:36:59,918
All the way out to California
by yourself.

416
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:04,354
I was really scared at first, you know,

417
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,085
but I think I made the right decision.

418
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,325
Definitely.

419
00:37:08,326 --> 00:37:09,926
Can't afford to be afraid

420
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:11,727
at your stage of the game.

421
00:37:15,833 --> 00:37:17,233
Right up here?

422
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,844
Yeah, that's it.

423
00:37:20,638 --> 00:37:23,838
Well, I guess I better let you out.

424
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:25,841
Thanks a lot.

425
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:27,243
Here's your bag.

426
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:29,245
Thanks.

427
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:31,246
If you want to show me

428
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:33,248
some of your other work sometime,

429
00:37:33,250 --> 00:37:34,650
I'd love to see it.

430
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:36,652
Like when... like after class?

431
00:37:36,654 --> 00:37:39,255
Yeah. I'm in the studio every afternoon

432
00:37:39,256 --> 00:37:40,856
by the faculty building.

433
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:42,858
O.k. yeah.

434
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,260
Maybe I'll do that.

435
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:45,501
Great.

436
00:38:17,895 --> 00:38:19,695
"June 1st.

437
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:22,297
"Ivy's philosophy number 21.

438
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,499
Never fall in love."

439
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:28,705
"As long as I can break somebody's heart,

440
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:30,906
that's love enough for me."

441
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,915
"How do you know what you can do

442
00:38:46,924 --> 00:38:48,534
until you do it?"

443
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:02,938
Hi.

444
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,540
Hi.

445
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,554
Ahem.

446
00:39:09,947 --> 00:39:11,347
How are you?

447
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:13,348
Good, and you?

448
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:15,350
I'm good.

449
00:39:15,352 --> 00:39:17,562
Thirsty?

450
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,556
Sure.

451
00:40:03,501 --> 00:40:05,701
You don't like it.

452
00:40:05,703 --> 00:40:07,203
No.

453
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,612
No, I think you look incredibly sexy.

454
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,077
I'm glad you like it.

455
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,879
Did Donald like it?

456
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:22,686
I saw him drop you off.

457
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,217
Seems like you're becoming

458
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,761
a regular teacher's pet.

459
00:40:26,857 --> 00:40:28,257
No.

460
00:40:28,258 --> 00:40:30,458
Just his babysitter.

461
00:40:45,442 --> 00:40:47,042
Do you still think

462
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,045
that I'm different...

463
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:50,646
Beautiful?

464
00:40:52,182 --> 00:40:54,182
Yeah.

465
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:55,785
Mmm.

466
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,186
May I?

467
00:40:57,187 --> 00:40:59,187
Hmm...

468
00:40:59,189 --> 00:41:00,789
O.k.

469
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,199
May I?

470
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:13,202

00:45:07,838 --> 00:45:09,908
Take me with you?

503
00:45:11,441 --> 00:45:13,041
I can't.

504
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,758
You didn't think I'd come.

505
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:10,399
I wasn't sure.

506
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:13,502
Bring it here.

507
00:46:36,526 --> 00:46:39,126
Great midwest.

508
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,929
Ha ha!

509
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:43,599
Mmm. That's nice.

510
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:45,200
Thanks.

511
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:48,974
Good student.

512
00:46:51,808 --> 00:46:53,408
Student?

513
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,278
Well...

514
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,480
You're still very cautious...

515
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,282
Careful.

516
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,215
You know, it's...

517
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:09,692
It's sort of funny to me

518
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,928
the way you can...

519
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,929
Teach and judge,

520
00:47:13,931 --> 00:47:15,331
and yet...

521
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,572
You yourself no longer paint.

522
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:21,570
Think that's funny?

523
00:47:21,571 --> 00:47:22,771
Ha ha!

524
00:47:22,772 --> 00:47:25,312
No. Actually, I think it's bullshit.

525
00:47:27,377 --> 00:47:29,877
Hmm...

526
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,980
What do you propose to do about it?

527
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,583
I don't know.

528
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:39,488
You see...

529
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,190
To be an artist...

530
00:47:44,394 --> 00:47:47,396
You know, to be a serious artist...

531
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:51,067
You have to be willing
to sacrifice everything.

532
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,668
You have to confront your demons

533
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,270
and go into battle with them.

534
00:47:58,608 --> 00:48:00,208
That's what I want.

535
00:48:01,611 --> 00:48:02,878
I'm ready for that.

536
00:48:02,879 --> 00:48:04,479
Really?

537
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:12,218
I lost a few battles
along the way myself.

538
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,233
That's why I stopped painting.

539
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:23,366
Well, then...

540
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:24,897
Maybe...

541
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,641
I can help you face your fears...

542
00:48:28,738 --> 00:48:31,608
And you could help me face mine.

543
00:48:33,643 --> 00:48:35,513
Are you sure?

544
00:48:46,656 --> 00:48:48,256
Sit down.

545
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,661
Do it.

546
00:49:20,890 --> 00:49:22,790
Take off your clothes.

547
00:49:22,792 --> 00:49:24,692
Ha ha!

548
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:29,831
Does that prospect frighten you?

549
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:33,073
Y-yeah, a little.

550
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,706
Then all the more reason to do it, right?

551
00:49:52,389 --> 00:49:53,989

662
00:58:08,284 --> 00:58:10,054

00:59:05,241 --> 00:59:06,241
Hi.

666
00:59:06,242 --> 00:59:08,510
Hmm, what should I have?

667
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,411
How about an icebreaker?

668
00:59:11,414 --> 00:59:14,316
And what exactly is an icebreaker?

669
00:59:14,317 --> 00:59:17,085
Turn around, and I'll show you.

670
00:59:17,086 --> 00:59:19,316
O.k.

671
00:59:19,322 --> 00:59:21,632
Don't move.

672
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:28,263
Uh...

673
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:46,022
Hey, to icebreakers.

674
00:59:49,385 --> 00:59:50,985
Thanks.

675
00:59:55,224 --> 00:59:57,159
Whoo!

676
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:00,000
Whoo hoo hoo!

677
01:00:27,190 --> 01:00:28,990
Dance with me.

678
01:01:02,625 --> 01:01:04,225
Oh, my god.

679
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:11,527
No one's safe with you around.

680
01:01:11,534 --> 01:01:14,074
Yeah. You got a problem with that?

681
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,938
Hi. This is Lily,

682
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:38,940
and I can't get to the phone.

683
01:04:38,942 --> 01:04:41,376
Leave me a message after the beep.

684
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,777
Thanks.

685
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,780
Lily, it's your mom.

686
01:04:45,781 --> 01:04:47,251
Lily, we're worried about you.

687
01:04:47,252 --> 01:04:49,250
Your dad wants to talk to you.

688
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:51,252
Hey, kiddo. How are you doing?

689
01:04:51,254 --> 01:04:52,860
Please call home, darling.

690
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:54,815
Your mother's driving me crazy.

691
01:04:54,823 --> 01:04:57,492
We'll see you at Thanksgiving, right?

692
01:04:57,493 --> 01:05:00,803
Ahem.

693
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:10,037
Is that the time?

694
01:05:13,776 --> 01:05:15,376
We're late for Donald's class.

695
01:05:15,378 --> 01:05:17,608
So we're late for professor fuck's class.

696
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,047
What's the big deal?

697
01:05:19,048 --> 01:05:20,648
I want to go.

698
01:05:20,649 --> 01:05:22,419
That's what the big deal is.

699
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:24,648
So go.

700
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:28,485
What do you think I'm trying to do?

701
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:47,440
So, what are you doing for Thanksgiving?

702
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:48,843
I don't know yet.

703
01:05:50,779 --> 01:05:52,779
Uh, bridgette, Tanya, and Robert

704
01:05:52,781 --> 01:05:54,981
are going to go home.

705
01:06:03,292 --> 01:06:06,328
It's going to get rather
lonely around here.

706
01:06:06,329 --> 01:06:07,929
What about you?

707
01:06:07,930 --> 01:06:10,170
What are you going to do?

708
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:13,404
Gredin?

709
01:06:48,837 --> 01:06:51,437
Hello? Hello?

710
01:06:58,414 --> 01:07:00,684
Who was that on the phone?

711
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:05,349
Gredin?

712
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,064
Who was that on the phone?

713
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:10,625
I don't know.

714
01:07:10,626 --> 01:07:12,996
Someone who didn't want to talk to me.

715
01:07:12,997 --> 01:07:15,495
There seems to be a hell of a lot

716
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:17,068
I don't know.

717
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:23,240
Don't.

718
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,211
What's the matter?

719
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,914
What did I do?

720
01:07:32,915 --> 01:07:34,515
You tell me.

721
01:07:36,785 --> 01:07:38,615
What are you doing?

722
01:07:41,324 --> 01:07:42,924
I want to know, Lily.

723
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:44,325
Um, I really can't

724
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:46,457
have this conversation right now

725
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:48,702
because I'm late for class.

726
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,582
I don't know who you are anymore.

727
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:09,384
I don't know

728
01:08:09,385 --> 01:08:12,315
who I'm making love to anymore.

729
01:08:12,321 --> 01:08:16,158
If this is some kind of contest, Lily...

730
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:18,359
I don't want to compete.

731
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,666
I thought you wrote these.

732
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,005
Hi.

733
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:40,406
Oh, what a nice surprise.

734
01:09:40,409 --> 01:09:43,177
Thought you might be hungry.

735
01:09:43,178 --> 01:09:45,178
As a matter of fact, I am.

736
01:09:45,180 --> 01:09:47,380
Since when do you lock the door?

737
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:49,623
Since the last campus shooting.

738
01:10:01,897 --> 01:10:03,027
Painting again?

739
01:10:03,031 --> 01:10:04,065
Mm-hmm.

740
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:06,466
It's delicious, honey. Thanks.

741
01:10:06,469 --> 01:10:07,969
Can I have a look?

742
01:10:07,970 --> 01:10:09,270
No.

743
01:10:09,272 --> 01:10:10,672
You know not to ask.

744
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:12,883
When I have something to show you,

745
01:10:12,884 --> 01:10:14,805
I'll show it to you.

746
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:20,014
Donald...

747
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,015
Yeah?

748
01:10:21,016 --> 01:10:23,746
You o.K.?

749
01:10:23,752 --> 01:10:25,487
Yeah. I'm fine.

750
01:10:25,488 --> 01:10:27,154
Why?

751
01:10:27,155 --> 01:10:29,355
So who are you painting?

752
01:10:31,427 --> 01:10:33,397
No one in particular.

753
01:10:35,931 --> 01:10:37,265
O.k. fine.

754
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,626
What?

755
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,644
Do you want me to yak about something

756
01:10:40,645 --> 01:10:43,266
I don't have the guts to do?

757
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,610
That's not what we're talking about.

758
01:10:45,611 --> 01:10:47,438
I don't want to lose you again,

759
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:48,843
and especially not

760
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:50,784
to some 20-year-old undergraduate

761
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:52,947
who looks at you like you're god

762
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:55,048
and poses between fucks.

763
01:10:55,050 --> 01:10:57,519
You and daphna are my life,

764
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:00,154
and I love you very much.

765
01:11:00,155 --> 01:11:02,155
And we've both been fooled

766
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:04,826
by that before, haven't we?

767
01:11:04,827 --> 01:11:07,627
Last time nearly killed us, Donald.

768
01:11:07,630 --> 01:11:09,570
Whatever.

769
01:11:57,312 --> 01:11:59,414
Well, where were you today?

770
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,575
What do you mean?

771
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:06,388
You weren't in class. Neither was gredin.

772
01:12:06,389 --> 01:12:09,289
Any connection between the two?

773
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:10,958
You know, I'm going to go

774
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,359
because this is...

775
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:15,397
Wait. Wait. Just tell me.

776
01:12:15,398 --> 01:12:17,068
Were you with him?

777
01:12:19,067 --> 01:12:20,867
Yes.

778
01:12:20,869 --> 01:12:23,738
Wait.

779
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:26,039
Don't go.

780
01:12:26,041 --> 01:12:28,441
I don't want you to go.

781
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:30,084
I can't let you go.

782
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,915
I can't stop thinking about you.

783
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,316
I'm painting again

784
01:12:35,317 --> 01:12:36,717
for the first time in years,

785
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,019
and it's because of you.

786
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:43,034
I've never felt this way before

787
01:12:43,035 --> 01:12:44,455
in my life.

788
01:12:44,460 --> 01:12:48,930
You helped me overcome my fear.

789
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:52,399
Big scaredy-cat.

790
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,908
Not anymore.

791
01:13:01,109 --> 01:13:02,609
Donald...

792
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:05,179
What are you doing?

793
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,415
Kissing you.

794
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,084
Falling in love with you.

795
01:13:10,085 --> 01:13:11,645
Don't.

796
01:13:13,155 --> 01:13:15,555
Why?

797
01:13:15,558 --> 01:13:17,088
Just don't.

798
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,429
Come here.

799
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:38,305
What?

800
01:14:38,306 --> 01:14:40,206
Your beauty scares me.

801
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,947
It terrifies me.

802
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:16,166
Wait. Wait.

803
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,178
Who is it?

804
01:16:24,179 --> 01:16:25,579
It's Diana.

805
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:26,980
Not right now, o.K.?

806
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:30,092
Oh, all right. I'll come back.

807
01:16:38,060 --> 01:16:41,600
It's all right. Please stay.

808
01:17:59,541 --> 01:18:01,909
I'm really sorry about the way

809
01:18:01,910 --> 01:18:05,210
I've been acting lately.

810
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:08,882
It's just this is

811
01:18:08,884 --> 01:18:11,485
a really hard transition for me,

812
01:18:11,486 --> 01:18:13,086
and I, uh...

813
01:18:16,658 --> 01:18:18,828
I've been confused.

814
01:18:20,662 --> 01:18:23,232
But I'm not confused anymore.

815
01:18:49,657 --> 01:18:52,757
Please don't give up on me.

816
01:19:09,677 --> 01:19:11,277
Don't just stand there, Donald.

817
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:12,479
Invite them in.

818
01:19:12,480 --> 01:19:15,380
Angela, hi. This is gredin.
I invited him.

819
01:19:15,383 --> 01:19:17,084
I hope you don't mind.

820
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:19,145
No, not at all. Hi, gredin.

821
01:19:19,154 --> 01:19:21,755
Do you two know each other?

822
01:19:21,756 --> 01:19:23,786
Yeah. He's in my class.

823
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:27,002
Oh. Well, then we've got the posse.

824
01:19:29,965 --> 01:19:32,565
It smells great in here.
Can I do anything?

825
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,567
You can set a place for gredin.

826
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:35,569
Hi, Lily.

827
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,970
Hey, little one!

828
01:19:36,972 --> 01:19:39,172
Can I ask you something?

829
01:19:39,174 --> 01:19:39,984
What?

830
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:41,575
Is gredin your boyfriend?

831
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:42,976
My boyfriend?

832
01:19:42,978 --> 01:19:44,978
Is that you?

833
01:19:44,980 --> 01:19:47,380
Yeah. Yes, it is.

834
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:50,584
Donald painted that a long time ago now,

835
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:52,315
but that's me.

836
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,419
Um, come in. Come on.

837
01:19:56,424 --> 01:19:58,334
I'll show you around.

838
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:24,885
Very good.

839
01:20:24,887 --> 01:20:27,057
Very nice.

840
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,899
Why didn't you tell me

841
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:40,501
you were inviting Lily?

842
01:20:40,502 --> 01:20:41,635
Thought I did.

843
01:20:41,636 --> 01:20:44,236
You didn't.

844
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:46,369
All set.

845
01:20:46,374 --> 01:20:48,509
Need some help?

846
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:49,880
Yeah. Thanks.

847
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:57,551
Wow. You did good

848
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:58,952
with this one, Lily.

849
01:20:58,954 --> 01:21:00,121
Thanks.

850
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:02,262
You bring the Cranberries for me?

851
01:21:02,263 --> 01:21:03,887
Uh-huh.

852
01:21:05,327 --> 01:21:07,527
Lily, grab the mineral water, would you?

853
01:21:07,529 --> 01:21:08,929
It's in the fridge.

854
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:10,171
Sure.

855
01:21:17,805 --> 01:21:21,535
I'm glad you're here. I wanted you here.

856
01:21:22,744 --> 01:21:24,845
What's up? Where are you going?

857
01:21:24,846 --> 01:21:26,246
Into the other room.

858
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:29,016
Where do you think I'm going?

859
01:21:29,017 --> 01:21:31,247
Wait just a second.

860
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:32,286
Don't.

861
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:34,957
Just let me look at you.

862
01:21:37,159 --> 01:21:39,159
Why did you bring him?

863
01:21:39,161 --> 01:21:42,101
Because he's my boyfriend.

864
01:21:51,106 --> 01:21:54,706
So, gredin, why don't you sit over here?

865
01:21:54,709 --> 01:21:56,109
Lily, next to gredin.

866
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,311
Daphna, you're here beside Lily.

867
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:08,920
Donald, you're over here next to me.

868
01:22:14,129 --> 01:22:16,729
Do you have a kit for Johnny?

869
01:22:16,731 --> 01:22:18,331
Of course.

870
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,247
Hmm.

871
01:23:16,591 --> 01:23:20,027
I'm finished, mom. I'm going to hide.

872
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:22,628
Fine, honey. You go ahead.

873
01:23:34,209 --> 01:23:36,739
Lily tells me you're a photographer.

874
01:23:36,744 --> 01:23:39,946
Mmm... i used to be. I'm
making a comeback.

875
01:23:39,947 --> 01:23:42,216
And you're a painter?

876
01:23:42,217 --> 01:23:43,817
I'm a sculptor, mostly.

877
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:45,886
An amazing sculptor.

878
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:48,287
With an aversion to life study.

879
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,890
That's not entirely true.

880
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:53,232
Really? News to me.

881
01:23:54,296 --> 01:23:57,466
Me and Donald agree
on a couple of things.

882
01:23:59,234 --> 01:24:01,444
Like your beauty, for example.

883
01:24:03,138 --> 01:24:06,438
I've never seen your work before.

884
01:24:06,441 --> 01:24:07,708
It's good.

885
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:11,049
It's amazing what you can
do with the right subject.

886
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,016
Donald's painting again.

887
01:24:16,017 --> 01:24:20,017
First time in a long while. Quite...

888
01:24:20,021 --> 01:24:21,891
I'm going to get some more wine.

889
01:24:21,892 --> 01:24:23,489
Serious about it.

890
01:24:24,892 --> 01:24:26,592
It's a secret.

891
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:34,568
So... um... how did you and Donald meet?

892
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:35,469
Wow... uh...

893
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:39,140
I wanted to do a life study class.

894
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,975
I... um... heard about this single,

895
01:24:41,976 --> 01:24:43,776
brilliant, good-looking professor,

896
01:24:43,778 --> 01:24:47,378
and, uh, weaseled my way into his class.

897
01:24:47,382 --> 01:24:48,982
The rest is history.

898
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:53,223
Bit of a cliche, I know, but...

899
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:56,223
Some more?

900
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:57,958
Yeah. Thanks.

901
01:24:57,959 --> 01:25:00,359
Angela was just telling us

902
01:25:00,362 --> 01:25:03,264
how the two of you met.

903
01:25:03,265 --> 01:25:05,925
Let's not bore them with our trivia.

904
01:25:05,933 --> 01:25:08,935
Never actually thought of it

905
01:25:08,936 --> 01:25:11,636
as trivia, Donald.

906
01:25:46,341 --> 01:25:47,674
Where's daphna?

907
01:25:47,675 --> 01:25:48,935
Sound asleep.

908
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:52,846
She should be in bed, shouldn't she?

909
01:25:52,847 --> 01:25:53,917
Yeah.

910
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:58,285
Come on, sweetie.

911
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:00,786
Let's go.

912
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:01,988
I'll take her.

913
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:07,089
No. I want daddy and Lily to take me.

914
01:26:07,094 --> 01:26:10,231
Oh, well.

915
01:26:10,232 --> 01:26:11,832
Good night.

916
01:26:23,445 --> 01:26:25,645
Let me give you a hand.

917
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,247
Yeah. Thank you.

918
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,394
There you go.

919
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,995
Sleep tight now, beautiful.

920
01:26:41,996 --> 01:26:44,196
O.k.

921
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,468
Good night, little girl.

922
01:26:47,469 --> 01:26:49,669
Good night, big girl.

923
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,414
What are you doing?

924
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:03,415
What does it feel like I'm doing?

925
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:05,418
It feels like you're fucking crazy.

926
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,360
I'm fucking crazy about you.

927
01:27:12,660 --> 01:27:13,927
What was that?

928
01:27:13,928 --> 01:27:15,095
Ah.

929
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,296
Ow!

930
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:19,769
Aah! I cut myself.

931
01:27:22,036 --> 01:27:23,066
Here.

932
01:27:23,070 --> 01:27:24,570
What are you going to do, huh?

933
01:27:24,572 --> 01:27:26,872
You going to fuck me right here?

934
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:31,345
I love you.

935
01:27:31,346 --> 01:27:32,946
You don't love me.

936
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,315
I do.

937
01:27:34,316 --> 01:27:36,246
No, you don't.

938
01:27:36,250 --> 01:27:38,250
Let me. Let me, please.

939
01:27:38,252 --> 01:27:39,722
No! No!

940
01:27:42,724 --> 01:27:43,964
No!

941
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,827
No!

942
01:27:46,828 --> 01:27:47,898
Lily, Lily...

943
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:04,345
Ohh! Oh!

944
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:06,706
Get off me.

945
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,388
Daphna!

946
01:28:31,339 --> 01:28:33,439
Daphna!

947
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:38,784
Aah! No!

948
01:28:53,027 --> 01:28:54,027
Daphna!

949
01:28:54,028 --> 01:28:55,828
Daphna...

950
01:28:55,830 --> 01:28:58,030
Don't you touch her!

951
01:28:58,032 --> 01:28:59,432
Don't you... get your...

952
01:28:59,434 --> 01:29:01,444
Don't you touch her, you bastard!

953
01:29:02,437 --> 01:29:04,037
What's the matter with you?

954
01:29:04,038 --> 01:29:05,038
Come on.

955
01:29:10,244 --> 01:29:13,647
911, state your emergency...

956
01:29:13,648 --> 01:29:15,378
Mamma?

957
01:31:15,570 --> 01:31:17,770
Fuck you, Ivy.

958
01:31:29,951 --> 01:31:31,951
Aah!

959
01:31:57,211 --> 01:31:59,211
Shit!

960
01:34:19,653 --> 01:34:23,089
Daphna's going to be fine.

961
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:25,730
I don't know if you care.

962
01:34:26,627 --> 01:34:27,997
And you?

963
01:34:29,363 --> 01:34:32,673
Am I fine, or do I care?

964
01:34:38,439 --> 01:34:40,209
Oh, gredin...

965
01:34:57,591 --> 01:35:00,994
I can't let you go, Lily.

966
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:04,095
Not after everything we've been through.

967
01:35:04,098 --> 01:35:07,968
Oh, no. It's over, Donald.

968
01:35:10,671 --> 01:35:13,411
Don't fight me, Lily.

969
01:35:21,348 --> 01:35:23,418
Don't shut me out!

970
01:35:26,687 --> 01:35:29,087
I can't let you go, Lily.

971
01:35:29,090 --> 01:35:31,960
I love you too much. I...

972
01:35:49,410 --> 01:35:50,780
Get off!

973
01:35:53,414 --> 01:35:55,124
Aah!

974
01:35:58,219 --> 01:35:59,919
No!

975
01:36:24,145 --> 01:36:26,145
I won't hurt you. Just let me in.

976
01:36:26,147 --> 01:36:28,347
The police are on their way.

977
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:54,674
I never meant to hurt you or your baby.

978
01:36:54,675 --> 01:36:57,105
You have to believe me.

979
01:36:58,145 --> 01:36:59,905
What are you doing?

980
01:37:01,048 --> 01:37:02,818
What are you doing?

981
01:37:04,385 --> 01:37:06,115
Donald!

982
01:37:06,120 --> 01:37:07,420
Aah!

983
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:19,097
Aah!

984
01:37:19,100 --> 01:37:21,100
Uh!

985
01:37:22,703 --> 01:37:26,943
No! No! No!

986
01:37:35,950 --> 01:37:39,150
Get away from me!

987
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:45,155
Go! Go! Go!

988
01:39:35,669 --> 01:39:37,069
I know it's pointless

989
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:39,671
to ask you to forgive me.

990
01:39:41,075 --> 01:39:44,075
O.k., well, I'm just going to talk,

991
01:39:44,078 --> 01:39:48,278
and then you won't have
to deal with me anymore.

992
01:39:50,684 --> 01:39:53,086
Um...

993
01:39:53,087 --> 01:39:58,087
My whole life, I've... I've felt
like a freak.

994
01:39:58,092 --> 01:40:02,095
You know, back home in Michigan,

995
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:05,696
I wasn't accepted
because I was different.

996
01:40:05,699 --> 01:40:08,099
And then I come here,

997
01:40:08,102 --> 01:40:10,702
and I'm not different enough.

998
01:40:15,709 --> 01:40:19,109
So... i decided...

999
01:40:19,113 --> 01:40:23,116
To become someone else...

1000
01:40:23,117 --> 01:40:29,057
Someone... tough and infallible...

1001
01:40:30,724 --> 01:40:34,334
Beautiful and sexy...

1002
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,329
Fearless.

1003
01:40:39,133 --> 01:40:40,733
And it worked.

1004
01:40:42,536 --> 01:40:45,736
For the first time in my life,

1005
01:40:45,739 --> 01:40:47,739
I was accepted.

1006
01:40:50,944 --> 01:40:55,354
And I became intoxicated
by the freedom of it all...
