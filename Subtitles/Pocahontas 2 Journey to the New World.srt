Great Chief...

00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:20,056
...I am John Rolfe.

170
00:13:21,057 --> 00:13:22,684
According to the customs...

171
00:13:26,396 --> 00:13:28,648
— How do you do?
— [Powhatan] Let him pass.

172
00:13:30,524 --> 00:13:32,276
According to the customs
of Greater Britain,

173
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:33,860
I would like to present this horse

174
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,863
as a gift of peace
to the mighty Pocahontas.

175
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,614
Daughter...

176
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:43,077
— You?
— ...this beast is for you.

177
00:13:44,369 --> 00:13:47,080
No, I'm sorry. It's my fault.

178
00:13:47,247 --> 00:13:51,000
— This horse, it's meant for...
— Pocahontas, your king said.

179
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:55,462
— Or did he speak falsely?
— [Stammers] No! Never.

180
00:13:55,629 --> 00:13:57,464
It's just that... This is...

181
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,133
No, this is...
This is perfectly fine.

182
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,801
Hm...

183
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,511
Good job, Rolfe.

184
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,517
I believe we can prosper together
in this great land

185
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,476
under King James' gracious rule.

186
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:17,731
To build trust, I would like you
to sail back with me...

187
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,527
— ...to meet my king.
— I do not want the pale chief's land.

188
00:14:22,694 --> 00:14:24,321
He wants mine.

189
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:27,365
Why doesn't he
cross the salt water to see me?

190
00:14:27,532 --> 00:14:32,120
I'm afraid that simply isn't done,
Your Grand "ChiefIiness."

191
00:14:32,287 --> 00:14:35,749
Your kind are barbarians.
They only want our land!

192
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:39,044
— They mean to destroy our sacred...
— Is that what they want?

193
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:42,546
You don't know.

194
00:14:42,713 --> 00:14:46,216
Father, someone must go.

195
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:48,760
You speak with the tongue
of a pale one.

196
00:14:48,926 --> 00:14:50,094
— You belong with them.
- [Gasps]

197
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:51,971
Perhaps you should go.

198
00:14:52,138 --> 00:14:55,515
No! This is a matter of diplomacy.

199
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,392
You can't handle a job like this.

200
00:15:01,145 --> 00:15:03,105
- I will go.
— Daughter...

201
00:15:03,272 --> 00:15:06,567
Father, please. I can do this.

202
00:15:09,612 --> 00:15:12,490
You have your mother's spirit.

203
00:15:12,948 --> 00:15:16,035
— Very well. It is decided.

Is that my Pocahontas?

- [Yipes]
— [Willow] My, what is it, child?

210
00:16:03,207 --> 00:16:06,794
You are concerned
about crossing the salt water.

211
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,796
What if I can't bring peace?

212
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:11,465
What if I'm destined to fail?
What if I make things worse?

213
00:16:11,632 --> 00:16:13,634
- What if?
— What if I can't make them listen?

214
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:17,054
What if the sky turns to fire
and your nose falls off?

[Squeals]

216
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:23,561
[Willow] Long ago, I told you
to listen with your heart.

217
00:16:23,727 --> 00:16:27,356
It is time to listen to your heart.

218
00:16:27,523 --> 00:16:29,399
But the spirits around me...

219
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:34,988
Can help, but only the spirit within
can guide you.

220
00:16:37,573 --> 00:16:41,285
Listen to the spirit within.

221
00:16:44,121 --> 00:16:46,373
Listen to the spirit within.

Grandmother Willow, it doesn't work.

Grandmother Willow?

230

[Man 1] Easy up, men!

00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:04,975
— [gasps] Look up!
- J‘ Who's that?

327
00:27:05,142 --> 00:27:06,726
J‘ That girl up in the tree

328
00:27:06,893 --> 00:27:08,853
J‘ It's not a tree
It's moving, see?

329
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,648
- J‘ Good grief, what can it be?
— J‘ Look there, I swear

330
00:27:12,815 --> 00:27:14,483
J‘ She's flying through the air

331
00:27:14,649 --> 00:27:18,194
- J‘ She must be wild
- J‘ She's just a child

332
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:21,489
— Pocahontas...
- J‘ I wish lhad her hair

333
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:24,824
Wouldn't you care to join me here,
on the ground? This instant?

334
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:28,328
J‘ My heart is pounding like a drum
I can't believe my eyes

335
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:32,165
J‘ In London people seem to come
in every shape and size

336
00:27:32,332 --> 00:27:36,169
J‘ 80 many paths
I wonder how they ﬁnd their way

337
00:27:36,336 --> 00:27:42,217
J‘ 80 many signs
I wonder what they really say

338
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:46,970
J‘ London is everything
I've heard and more

339
00:27:47,137 --> 00:27:50,849
J‘ London is nothing
like I've seen before

340
00:27:51,016 --> 00:27:54,353
J‘ Music and feathered hats
and roofs that shine

341
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,023
J‘ With flags flying higher than a pine

342
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,192
J‘ She seems so sweet
She means us well

343
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:02,277
— J‘ Size 20 feet
- J‘ How can you tell?

344
00:28:02,444 --> 00:28:07,074
- J‘ We'll rue this day, you wait and see
- J‘ What is to be or not to be

345
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:12,620
J‘ How do they build their huts so tall?
Can this be all one tribe?

346
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:16,582
J‘ The things they sell, the things
I smell I never could describe

347
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:20,044
J‘ These cakes taste just like berries
picked this very day

348
00:28:20,211 --> 00:28:25,925
J‘ The sound a river makes
still takes my breath away

349
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:31,639
J‘ London's as busy as a hive of bees

350
00:28:31,806 --> 00:28:35,226
J‘ Grandmother Willow
would just love these trees

351
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:38,896
J‘ Crowded and loud
but so exciting too

352
00:28:39,063 --> 00:28:42,316
J‘ With colors I never even knew

353
00:28:42,483 --> 00:28:46,070
J‘ What a day in London
Nothing strange at all

354
00:28:46,237 --> 00:28:50,241
J‘ Except a girl with someone
who may be ten feet tall

355
00:28:50,408 --> 00:28:53,744
J‘ This day's become a day
no one is likely to forget

356
00:28:53,911 --> 00:28:57,415
J‘ A day we'll all remember
as the day two worlds have met

357
00:28:57,582 --> 00:28:59,208
J‘ Such beauty's rare
I 'm quite impressed

358
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:01,251
J‘ One mustn't stare
She's barely dressed

359
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:03,170
J‘ The strength of ten
That's what I've heard

360
00:29:03,336 --> 00:29:05,088
J‘ She's won the men
Just take my word

361
00:29:05,255 --> 00:29:06,839
J‘ A brave young thing
to venture here

362
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:08,757
J‘ It will be an adventure, dear

363
00:29:08,924 --> 00:29:10,843
J‘ Perhaps some brew
to quench your thirst?

364
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:12,594
J‘ But not with you
I saw her ﬁrst

365
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,264
J‘ What a day in London
History was made

366
00:29:16,431 --> 00:29:20,018
J‘ Take away the mystery
Then you're not afraid

367
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:21,603
J‘ We've seen a girl

368
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:23,688
J‘ I've seen a world

369
00:29:23,855 --> 00:29:27,358
- J‘ I never dreamed I'd see
- J‘ We never dreamed we'd see

370
00:29:27,525 --> 00:29:31,070
J‘ And what an extra special day
Unique in truly every way

371
00:29:31,237 --> 00:29:33,448
J‘ How wonderful this London day

372
00:29:33,615 --> 00:29:38,494
J‘ Turned out to be J‘

[gasps] You!

380
00:30:03,935 --> 00:30:07,188
Well done, Rolfe, bringing back
a heathen as an example.

381
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:10,566
Look at her. [Chuckles]
She sticks out like a sore thumb.

382
00:30:10,733 --> 00:30:13,318
Pocahontas is here
as an emissary of her people.

383
00:30:13,485 --> 00:30:14,861
A personal guest of the king.

384
00:30:15,028 --> 00:30:17,821
The king has appointed me to lead
an armada against the savages.

385
00:30:17,988 --> 00:30:22,243
Don't tell me you didn't know?
The king wants his gold.

386
00:30:22,910 --> 00:30:26,372
— There is no gold.
— Another barbarian lie.

387
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:30,334
As soon as the ships are armed,
I set sail to destroy the heathens

388
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:33,337
and reclaim Jamestown for James.

389
00:30:35,464 --> 00:30:37,841
- [Whip snaps]
— [horse whinnies]

390
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:41,428
We must stop him!
Warn your king of his lies!

391
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:45,599
But he wasn't lying.
The parchment bore the king's seal.

392
00:30:45,766 --> 00:30:50,187
What? Then your king's promise
to meet me was the lie.

393
00:30:50,354 --> 00:30:54,024
— The king doesn't lie!
— They cannot both be true.

394
00:30:54,191 --> 00:30:58,028
No. Lt'sjust a misunderstanding.
It has to be.

395
00:30:59,571 --> 00:31:02,449
I can straighten this out. Come on.

396
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:13,001
Are you riding or running?

397
00:31:33,479 --> 00:31:35,773
- Mrs. Jenkins!
— [Glass shatters]

398
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:38,484
Oh! Oh! Ohh!

399
00:31:38,651 --> 00:31:41,738
Gods be gracious, is that my Johnny?

400
00:31:47,577 --> 00:31:48,703
— Ohh...
— [Meeko thuds]

401
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:53,207
Ohh, Johnny, you need a bath.

402
00:31:53,833 --> 00:31:56,336
- Oh! Oh, Johnny!
— Look at you.

403
00:31:56,502 --> 00:31:59,172
[Mrs Jenkins laughs]

404
00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:01,341
Oh, you.

405
00:32:02,216 --> 00:32:05,345
Mrs. Jenkins, I would like
to introduce Pocahontas.

406
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:07,221
Pocahontas, Mrs. Jenkins.

407
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:09,682
The Jenkins have been
with the Rolfes for generations.

408
00:32:09,849 --> 00:32:13,353
— Careful. She's about to put on tea.
— I'll put on some tea.

409
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:14,895
Oh! Ooh...

410
00:32:17,564 --> 00:32:19,274
[John] Oh, and Uttamatomakkin.

411
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:21,360
Ohh...

412
00:32:21,526 --> 00:32:24,529
I'll put on lots and lots of tea.

413
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,784
— I'm off to see the king.
— I want to go with you.

414
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:33,288
Pocahontas, the conventions in England
are very complex.

415
00:32:33,455 --> 00:32:36,541
— I must go alone.
- But...

416
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,794
I promise, I will arrange
for you to see the king.

417
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,381
— My word as a gentleman. Trust me.

Hmm.

Mm. [Chuckles]

425
00:33:15,534 --> 00:33:19,246
I must find a way
to warn my people, to stop this.

426
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,581
Leave it to Johnny.

427
00:33:21,748 --> 00:33:25,460
He gave you his word
as a gentleman, my dear.

428
00:33:25,627 --> 00:33:27,921
You can stake your life on that.

429
00:33:28,255 --> 00:33:31,383
[John] I didn't exactly
bring the Indian chief.

430
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:36,430
No, no, no, no. I told you I would
meet with the chief and no one less.

431
00:33:36,596 --> 00:33:39,181
Knight to bishop three.

432
00:33:40,141 --> 00:33:43,352
[John] Sire, I gave these people
your word you would meet.

433
00:33:44,186 --> 00:33:45,229
Are we not honor—bound...

434
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:47,022
[Ratcliffe] The king
is bound to nothing,

435
00:33:47,189 --> 00:33:48,983
when you can not fulfill your mission.

436
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,945
You were sent for the savage leader,
and yet you bring back a woman.

437
00:33:53,112 --> 00:33:54,155
A woman!

438
00:33:55,197 --> 00:33:57,574
Your Highness,
she is royalty, a princess.

439
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,951
She is the daughter of a great chief

440
00:34:00,118 --> 00:34:03,455
who has travelled far from her homeland
in the interests of peace.

441
00:34:03,621 --> 00:34:05,665
Meet with her, Your Majesty.

442
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:08,585
May I suggest she attend the Hunt Ball?

443
00:34:08,751 --> 00:34:11,920
Let her go back to Virginia
having witnessed the royal might

444
00:34:12,087 --> 00:34:15,215
and majesty of English society.

445
00:34:15,382 --> 00:34:17,967
Sire, she doesn't know our customs.

446
00:34:18,134 --> 00:34:20,094
To subject her to this kind of scrutiny
would be...

447
00:34:20,261 --> 00:34:22,346
Well, I don't understand, Rolfe.

448
00:34:22,513 --> 00:34:25,892
If she's not a savage,
then why shouldn't she fit in?

449
00:34:26,058 --> 00:34:28,227
Excellent idea, Ratcliffe.

450
00:34:28,394 --> 00:34:31,563
Rolfe, you will bring her
to the Hunt Ball.

451
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,691
Prove to me she
is as civilized as you claim,

452
00:34:34,858 --> 00:34:37,486
and I will stop my armada.

453
00:34:37,652 --> 00:34:40,280
— If not, the armada sails.
— But, sire...

454
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,909
— It is decided!
- Pawn to king!

455
00:34:46,077 --> 00:34:47,204
Check.

'[John grunts]

00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,463
She's invited to the Hunt Ball!

You were successful?
When do I see the king?

461
00:35:11,061 --> 00:35:13,563
Our meeting with the king
has been corrupted.

462
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:16,816
— You're now invited to the Hunt Ball.
— I don't understand.

463
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:20,820
Oh, it's a trap!
Ratcliffe manipulated the king!

464
00:35:20,987 --> 00:35:23,907
He's saying that if you're civilized
you can fit right in.

465
00:35:24,074 --> 00:35:27,911
But it's the elite of British society,
etiquette and manners.

466
00:35:28,078 --> 00:35:31,331
There's a million ways you can
insult someone. Believe me, I know.

467
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:33,041
And if you slip up just once,

468
00:35:33,208 --> 00:35:36,920
— Ratcliffe can convince the king...
— Then I must not slip up.

469
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:39,713
I can't learn your ways alone,

470
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,257
but you can help me.

471
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:43,799

This is torture!

This is an animal, nothing more.

649
00:48:34,326 --> 00:48:36,161
A helpless animal.

650
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:40,624
Sit down at once, and we will
overlook this savage behavior.

651

Your behavior is savage.

No! Your Majesty, please!
It was a misunderstanding!

Push me no farther or face treason.

I'll play that card there.

The least you could do
is put a head on it.

But I just heard meself
from a guard what was there.

The king's gonna have her head.

[Smith] Ratcliffe convinced the king
I was the traitor.

I had to stay hidden, let them

I wanted to. I must have started
a thousand letters.

Well, are you suggesting
she turn her back on them?

[Smith] Are you
suggesting she die for them?

They're not going to listen to you.
Look at you.

How can they respect my culture
if they haven't seen it?

This is insane! Nuts!

Tell her she's crazy.

You're crazy.

Your Grace, if you insist on war,

my people will fight
to the last warrior.

776
00:58:59,381 --> 00:59:01,717
There is nothing to be gained,

777

but much to be lost, for all of us.

There is no gold, is there?

— [Crowd gasps]

Ratcliffe has lied to you
about everything.

782
00:59:23,363 --> 00:59:28,118
There are many voices around you,
but you must listen to your own voice.

783
00:59:28,285 --> 00:59:30,996
Why do you speak out
when so many doubt you,

784
00:59:31,163 --> 00:59:33,956
even when it could mean your life?

785
00:59:34,123 --> 00:59:36,667
Because I speak the truth.

SHence!

00:59:41,923 --> 00:59:44,800
Ratcliffe has left.
We must stop him!

— But it's too late.
— We must try.

789
00:59:51,933 --> 00:59:56,896
[Ratcliffe] You are the best soldiers
in the civilized world.

We sail to scour the world

— I thought he was dead!

798
01:00:23,672 --> 01:00:28,343
I'm the ghost of John Smith.
Run for your lives!

799
01:00:30,303 --> 01:00:31,971
[Grunts]

800
01:00:42,773 --> 01:00:44,233
Whew!

801
01:00:48,737 --> 01:00:50,613
[Both grunting]

802
01:01:01,791 --> 01:01:03,667
Who started the party without me?

803
01:01:08,380 --> 01:01:11,216
— You call this a party?
— You're not having any fun?

804
01:01:19,057 --> 01:01:21,017
[Screams]

805
01:01:22,435 --> 01:01:24,145
[all shouting]

806
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,275
— [screams]
— [squeaking]

[grunts, gasps]

808
01:01:42,038 --> 01:01:43,622
Drop the anchor!

809
01:01:43,789 --> 01:01:44,749
[Shouts]

810
01:01:48,126 --> 01:01:49,626
— [man 1] Hard to port!
— [Man 2] Bring her about!

811
01:01:49,793 --> 01:01:50,753
Bring her about!

812
01:01:52,504 --> 01:01:53,714
[Man 3] Prepare to crash!

813
01:01:55,132 --> 01:01:56,340
[Men screaming]

814

[screaming continues]

815
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:10,063
Now I can finally
get rid of you, you savage!

816
01:02:12,106 --> 01:02:13,274
Mind if I Cut in?

817
01:02:13,441 --> 01:02:14,901
[Grunting]

818
01:02:23,034 --> 01:02:24,494
Trying to make a point?

819
01:02:24,911 --> 01:02:26,454
[Grunting continues]

820
01:02:39,634 --> 01:02:43,137
Please, don't hurt me, Smith.
I was just doing my duty.

821
01:02:43,304 --> 01:02:44,347
Sheath your sword.

822
01:02:44,514 --> 01:02:47,725
Surely you know that a good soldier
always follows orders.

823
01:02:47,892 --> 01:02:52,105
If it were I, I would have
killed you years ago.

824
01:02:53,064 --> 01:02:56,484
As I was saying,
I never liked you, Smith.

825
01:02:56,651 --> 01:02:59,820
I hereby sentence you to death.

826
01:02:59,986 --> 01:03:01,822
Goodbye, Smith.

827
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,159
[Grunting]

828
01:03:07,911 --> 01:03:10,288
— Very stylish.
— I learned it from the best.

829
01:03:11,331 --> 01:03:14,876
Pity. I so would have
preferred to see you hang.

830
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:18,128

[groaning, sputtering]

834
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:40,440
[panting] Huh?

835
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:42,901
Your Majesty,
the fugitives are getting away!

836
01:03:43,068 --> 01:03:45,779
They've sabotaged the armada.
Stop them!

837
01:03:46,613 --> 01:03:49,283
No more lies.

838
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,076
Arrest him.

839
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,249
[Distant cheering]

840
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:04,463
- John Smith, what a heroic return.
— Why, thank you, my lady.

841
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:07,215
— How did you escape?
— We thought you were dead.

842
01:04:07,382 --> 01:04:08,800
[Man] Bravo, John!

843
01:04:08,967 --> 01:04:10,969
[Voices chattering]

844
01:04:21,312 --> 01:04:23,772
Lord Advisor to the Royal Court.

845
01:04:23,939 --> 01:04:25,733
What a wonderful honor.

846
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:27,735
[Squeaking]

847
01:04:28,527 --> 01:04:30,696
It's what you've always wanted.

848
01:04:30,863 --> 01:04:31,822
[Groaning]

849
01:04:32,573 --> 01:04:35,993
And you, you've done everything
you've set out to do...

850
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,786
...and more.

851
01:04:40,623 --> 01:04:42,415
Your people will be very proud.

852
01:04:45,126 --> 01:04:48,671
Yes. It will be good
to see them again.

853
01:04:48,838 --> 01:04:51,299
Well, perhaps one day
you'll return to London.

854
01:04:52,342 --> 01:04:53,426
— Pocahontas...
— John...

855
01:04:53,593 --> 01:04:56,012
The king has given me a ship!
This is my dream!

856
01:04:57,013 --> 01:05:01,226
Ours. Every day a new adventure.
New lands to discover.

857
01:05:01,392 --> 01:05:05,521
I'll chart a new course.
And you'll be at my side, naturally.

858
01:05:05,688 --> 01:05:07,648
A ship of our own!

859
01:05:07,814 --> 01:05:11,777
I'll put a crew together immediately!
We'll set sail right away!

860
01:05:13,069 --> 01:05:14,111
What?

861
01:05:16,322 --> 01:05:18,658
That's not what you want, is it?

862
01:05:19,742 --> 01:05:22,453
We walked the same path once.

863
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,164
I have found where I belong.

864
01:05:26,958 --> 01:05:30,044
I hope you will also find happiness.

865
01:05:30,211 --> 01:05:33,631
May the Great Spirit
always be with you.

[Humming]

— [man] Look smart, men!
— [Boy] I don't see anything.

871
01:06:18,718 --> 01:06:22,847
— Mrs. Jenkins!
— Oh, there you are, dear.

872
01:06:23,014 --> 01:06:24,265
Over here.

873

Ooh... Oh.

874
01:06:27,226 --> 01:06:31,605
Mrs. Jenkins, thank you
so much for everything.

875
01:06:31,772 --> 01:06:34,859
- Is John Rolfe here?
— I haven't seen him, dear.

876
01:06:35,026 --> 01:06:39,864
I thought he was with you. Maybe he
hates goodbyes as much as I do.

877
01:06:40,031 --> 01:06:41,866
Goodbye, dear.

878

[John] Well, perhaps one day
we'll return to London.

882
01:07:08,849 --> 01:07:10,225
John!

883
01:07:12,936 --> 01:07:14,938
What about your duty to the king?

884
01:07:15,105 --> 01:07:18,359
I have a duty to honor
what is in my heart, Pocahontas.

Ta—ta. Pip—pip.

Come on, Uti.
Let's put on some tea.

888
01:07:28,368 --> 01:07:30,661
And you, mind your manners.

[Growls]

890
01:07:35,124 --> 01:07:36,667
Let's go home.

891

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
