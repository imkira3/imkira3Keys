1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:48,050
Hyper Metal Sonic, the only thing left
is to capture his essential life data.

3
00:00:48,095 --> 00:00:52,657
Then you will be complete.

4
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:55,065
When you awaken, it will be time!

5
00:01:51,224 --> 00:01:52,851
Sonic!

6
00:01:52,893 --> 00:01:54,451
It's finally done!

7
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:58,294
See, isn't it great?
It's a jet-propelled body board!

8
00:01:58,331 --> 00:01:59,992
Come on, Sonic.
Don't you wanna try it too?

9
00:02:00,033 --> 00:02:01,864
No thanks.

10
00:02:01,902 --> 00:02:04,268
All right, I'll try it myself!

11
00:02:04,304 --> 00:02:08,365
I guess Tails is still
just a little kid.

12
00:02:40,106 --> 00:02:43,633
Come on, Sonic!
It's okay if you can't swim!

13
00:02:43,677 --> 00:02:45,008
You should give it a try!

14
00:02:45,045 --> 00:02:48,412
Just don't get cocky and
run into something.

15
00:02:55,255 --> 00:02:57,086
I must be hearing things.

16
00:02:58,358 --> 00:03:01,191
Sonic! Help me!

17
00:03:01,228 --> 00:03:04,823
Wake up, Sonic! Come on, Sonic!

18
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:07,957
Shut up, Tails!

19
00:03:16,443 --> 00:03:17,341
Sonic.

20
00:03:18,378 --> 00:03:20,073
Are you all right, Sonic?

21
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:23,406
I'm fine, but who the heck was that?

22
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,443
Sonic, how have you been?

23
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:30,652
Geez, not that old man again!
I'll pass on this one.

24
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,659
Sonic, we've gotta hurry up
and do something!

25
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:36,355
You're the one who can fly,
why don't you just go and do something?

26
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,265
Sonic, you idiot!

27
00:03:41,368 --> 00:03:43,768
Fine, I can take care of this
all by myself!

28
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,161
Mister! Mister!

29
00:03:46,206 --> 00:03:48,936
Tails, it's you!
It's nice to see you again.

30
00:03:48,975 --> 00:03:52,240
I have some urgent business with Sonic.
That's why I'm here.

31
00:03:52,279 --> 00:03:56,648
Mister, this isn't the time to worry
about that. Your rocket's on fire!

32
00:03:56,683 --> 00:03:59,675
What? No wonder it's getting
so warm in here!

33
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:01,311
Just hold on!

34
00:04:01,354 --> 00:04:02,787
I'll fix it somehow!

35
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,786
I'm not finished yet!

36
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,638
Hey, you're pretty good at this, Tails!

37
00:04:22,676 --> 00:04:26,043
I got some practice in earlier
on my body-board.

38
00:04:27,747 --> 00:04:29,977
That's amazing!

39
00:04:30,016 --> 00:04:31,643
Mister, up ahead!

40
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:32,845
Look out!

41
00:04:32,886 --> 00:04:35,787
What are you talking about? Let's see.

42
00:04:41,628 --> 00:04:44,028
Sonic!

43
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:10,722
Thank you, Sonic!

44
00:05:18,865 --> 00:05:20,833
Old man! Hey, old man!

45
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,628
Ouch!

46
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:29,337
Old man, you should stop flying
those dangerous things.

47
00:05:29,376 --> 00:05:32,174
What are you talking about, Sonic?

48
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:33,406
I know I'm a little older now,

49
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:39,180
but back in my heyday I won the Speed
Races on Planet Freedom all the time.

50
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:43,519
Believe me, I was pretty popular with
the ladies back then too.

51
00:05:43,757 --> 00:05:46,089
Mister, didn't you say you had
some urgent business?

52
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:49,061
Oh, right. It's a real emergency.

53
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:50,892
It's the President. He wanted...

54
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,066
He wants us to come to the
Presidential Palace right away?

55
00:06:00,106 --> 00:06:03,075
Right, that was it! Please hurry!

56
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:06,010
Old man, you could have just
called to tell us that.

57
00:06:06,046 --> 00:06:08,844
Oh, yeah, I guess I could've done that.

58
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:41,007
Old man, take care of the place
while we're gone!

59
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:43,948
I understand!

60
00:06:43,983 --> 00:06:45,507
I don't think so.

61
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:47,577
Let's go, Tails!

62
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:02,496
Bon voyage!

63
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,615
President, what's the
urgent business?

64
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:29,827
Right, the business. It's been
a long time, Sonic, Tails.

65
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,694
Dr. Eggman!

66
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,724
Please accept a small token of my
gratitude for coming all this way.

67
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,039
That's a funny way to show
your gratitude.

68
00:07:44,878 --> 00:07:46,243
Don't do it!

69
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,874
Sonic, for the sake of my daughter
and everyone else, listen to him!

70
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,884
That's a dirty trick, Eggman.

71
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:54,142
Eggman!

72
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:58,920
You kidnaped the President and Seira so you could take
over South Island, didn't you?

73
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:04,222
Do you think really think I would do
something that underhanded?

74
00:08:04,264 --> 00:08:05,822
Of course!

75
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:08,700
Listen, Sonic.

76
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,329
This concerns all of Planet Freedom,

77
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,770
so you'd better listen to everything
I have to say.

78
00:08:12,806 --> 00:08:14,068
No way.

79
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:16,575
Don't you care what happens
to pretty, young Seira?

80
00:08:16,609 --> 00:08:18,406
Help me, Papa!

81
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,241
Seira!

82
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,875
Sonic, please listen to what
Eggman has to say!

83
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:25,009
I guess I don't have a choice.

84
00:08:25,051 --> 00:08:26,985
Go ahead and talk, Eggman.

85
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,783
Really, Sonic?

86
00:08:28,822 --> 00:08:34,488
As both of you are aware, Planet Freedom
is made up of two separate dimensions.

87
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:38,019
The outer world, the one you live in,
is known as the Land of the Sky.

88
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:39,395
We already know all that.

89
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:41,866
Shut up! Shut up!

90
00:08:41,901 --> 00:08:46,235
And the inner dimension is known
as the Land of Darkness.

91
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:48,103
I live peacefully in the
inner dimension,

92
00:08:48,141 --> 00:08:52,601
where I have created a high-tech
city called Eggmanland.

93
00:08:52,645 --> 00:08:53,509
Recently,

94
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:58,381
a man who calls himself the God of
Destruction arrived: Black Eggman.

95
00:08:58,418 --> 00:09:00,079
I don't know where he came from,

96
00:09:00,119 --> 00:09:02,644
but he attacked Eggmanland with
a battalion of robots.

97
00:09:04,457 --> 00:09:08,393
They completely conquered us.

98
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:14,156
Now, there is no place down there
for me to live.

99
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,196
Black Eggman found the complex where the
high voltage electricity is stored.

100
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,472
He jammed the Egg Generator,
causing it to run wild.

101
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:28,703
According to my calculations,

102
00:09:28,748 --> 00:09:33,048
if the Egg Generator isn't stopped
by sunrise tomorrow,

103
00:09:33,086 --> 00:09:36,078
there will be a giant explosion!

104
00:09:43,162 --> 00:09:46,222
Fine! But don't blame me
when this happens!

105
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:54,170
What can we do to stop this, Eggman?

106
00:09:54,207 --> 00:09:58,940
Someone has to get through all
of Black Eggman's traps.

107
00:09:58,978 --> 00:10:03,506
Then he has to get into Eggmanland
and stop that generator!

108
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:05,449
And it's the fastest one here
that should do it!

109
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:06,975
No way.

110
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,387
You're the one that created that stupid
machine in the first place.

111
00:10:10,423 --> 00:10:12,687
Why the hell should I have to clean up after you?

112
00:10:13,726 --> 00:10:17,184
Sonic! Please do it! South Island...

113
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,927
No, the entire planet is
depending on you!

114
00:10:22,869 --> 00:10:24,894
Sonic, I don't care what happens
to Eggman or Papa,

115
00:10:24,938 --> 00:10:27,406
but please do this for both of us!

116
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:32,740
But when Eggman speaks, 99 times out
of 100 he's lying.

117
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:35,043
But what if this is that one other time?

118
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:37,440
Sonic!

119
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:39,041
Sonic!

120
00:10:39,419 --> 00:10:41,148
Okay, I got it.

121
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:42,745
Sonic...

122
00:10:42,789 --> 00:10:44,848
Tails, take this with you.

123
00:10:44,891 --> 00:10:45,823
What's this?

124
00:10:45,858 --> 00:10:47,758
It's a navigator.

125
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:50,490
It will guide you to Eggmanland
using the shortest route,

126
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,158
as long as you keep it with you.

127
00:10:53,199 --> 00:10:54,393
Thank you, Eggman.

128
00:10:54,434 --> 00:10:56,026
Let's go, Tails.

129
00:11:05,945 --> 00:11:10,405
Tails, do you really trust that weird,
little gadget that Eggman gave you?

130
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:14,079
Knowing that guy, he might've put
a bomb in there.

131
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,420
Dr. Eggman is the only one that knows
how to get to Eggmanland.

132
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:20,255
We don't have any other choice
but to trust this thing.

133
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:21,658
Well, I guess you're right.

134
00:11:21,694 --> 00:11:25,425
Even more importantly, I hope that the
President and Seira are all right.

135
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:40,408
No, no, no, I don't like it
when Eggman wins every time!

136
00:11:40,446 --> 00:11:42,038
All right, one more time!

137
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:44,675
That's enough! Give up!
We've played like a hundred times!

138
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:46,480
I'll stop being your hostage.

139
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,146
Do your best!

140
00:11:58,598 --> 00:12:03,035
No, no, no, Eggman won again! Fine!

141
00:12:03,736 --> 00:12:06,432
I quit. I want to go for a drive.

142
00:12:06,472 --> 00:12:07,632
NO!

143
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:10,938
No, no! Seira wants to go for a drive!

144
00:12:16,349 --> 00:12:17,611
How did this get here?

145
00:12:18,484 --> 00:12:20,281
You rock, Eggman!

146
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:22,446
I get to drive first!

147
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,456
Don't touch that!

148
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,924
No, wait! Don't play with that!
Stop it, Seira!

149
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:30,790
No, stop that! Seira!

150
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:44,272
That must be the entrance to
the Land of Darkness!

151
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,406
We're getting some bad turbulence here,
so hang on, Sonic!

152
00:12:48,448 --> 00:12:49,972
All right, here we go!

153
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:08,261
Hang on, Sonic!
We're almost out of here!

154
00:13:22,915 --> 00:13:24,246
Tails!

155
00:13:25,151 --> 00:13:26,743
Tails, are you all right?

156
00:13:30,423 --> 00:13:33,290
I'm fine, but I'm worried about
the tornado!

157
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:43,927
So this is the Land of Darkness!

158
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,201
Eggmanland should be straight ahead!

159
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,231
All right! Let's hurry!

160
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:05,611
Tails, doesn't something seem
a little strange?

161
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:08,381
I think Eggman purposely picked the
route with the most traps!

162
00:15:08,421 --> 00:15:11,015
But this really is the quickest
way to the generator!

163
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:13,321
There's even be a warp zone
right up ahead!

164
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,293
Let's get moving!

165
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:51,489
What is this place?

166
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,193
Let me check. We just exited the
warp zone, so this should be...

167
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,997
It says these are ancient ruins.

168
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,527
Ancient ruins? These?

169
00:16:00,139 --> 00:16:03,199
I never knew the Land of Darkness
had any of this.

170
00:16:03,242 --> 00:16:06,769
But Eggmanland is supposed to
be really near.

171
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:09,906
Let's go somewhere high and
see if we can see it from there.

172
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:11,348
All right!

173
00:16:16,622 --> 00:16:19,352
The ruins are sinking right
into the ocean!

174
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:24,455
Sonic, I bet it's because the Egg
Generator is out of control

175
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:26,624
and causing reactions under the ground!

176
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,260
All right! We should hurry!

177
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,301
I'm afraid of lightning!

178
00:16:37,643 --> 00:16:39,907
Tails, we just have to go
straight ahead, right?

179
00:16:39,945 --> 00:16:41,310
That's what it says.

180
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:02,691
That has to be Black Eggman!

181
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:07,370
That is correct. I am Black Eggman.

182
00:17:07,406 --> 00:17:12,742
I congratulate you on eluding my traps
and making it all the way here.

183
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:17,306
We don't have time to play your
little games! Get out of our way!

184
00:17:17,350 --> 00:17:19,443
I don't think so!

185
00:17:25,024 --> 00:17:26,855
Hold still!

186
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,356
Ouch!

187
00:17:28,394 --> 00:17:32,421
You fool, this armor is made of
a super polymer alloy!

188
00:17:32,531 --> 00:17:35,056
Ouch! Ouch!

189
00:17:35,801 --> 00:17:37,359
Damn!

190
00:17:38,971 --> 00:17:41,235
Where are you little brats hiding?

191
00:17:41,273 --> 00:17:43,264
Come out here!

192
00:17:44,076 --> 00:17:46,636
We don't have time to mess
around with this robot!

193
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:48,544
Which way to Eggmanland?

194
00:17:48,581 --> 00:17:50,515
Let me check...

195
00:17:50,549 --> 00:17:51,675
That way!

196
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,548
It's past that highway!

197
00:17:53,586 --> 00:17:56,214
All right! Let's go, Tails!

198
00:17:56,255 --> 00:17:58,155
Okay, Sonic!

199
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,657
Black Eggman, you slowpoke!

200
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:00,716
What?

201
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,990
We know you can't keep up with our speed,

202
00:18:03,028 --> 00:18:05,895
so we'll just have to finish
this later.

203
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:16,204
No way!

204
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,869
This is bad!

205
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:22,873
I didn't know that thing could fly!

206
00:18:52,878 --> 00:18:53,742
Sonic!

207
00:18:53,779 --> 00:18:57,340
Tails, grab onto me!

208
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:22,263
We're safe!

209
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,509
Don't think you're safe yet.

210
00:19:25,544 --> 00:19:29,947
Neither one of you can swim, so you'll
both drown in the ocean below.

211
00:19:35,988 --> 00:19:38,684
I can't swim!

212
00:19:38,757 --> 00:19:40,349
Gurgle, gurgle, gurgle...

213
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:45,855
I've finally gotten those two
out of the way!

214
00:19:47,967 --> 00:19:49,229
That worked pretty well.

215
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:50,963
Yeah, let's go.

216
00:19:52,271 --> 00:19:53,465
Geez...

217
00:20:02,414 --> 00:20:04,939
Crash! Crack! Boom!

218
00:20:04,984 --> 00:20:06,679
Damn!

219
00:20:06,719 --> 00:20:07,515
You damn moron!

220
00:20:07,553 --> 00:20:10,989
Did you really think I'd fall for a
stupid trick like that? Take this!

221
00:20:14,793 --> 00:20:16,124
What the heck is this stuff?

222
00:20:20,399 --> 00:20:21,593
Sonic!

223
00:20:21,634 --> 00:20:23,261
Tails!

224
00:20:23,302 --> 00:20:25,862
Now, it's time for this!

225
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:42,217
Now, I just have to finish you off.

226
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:45,883
There's no way those missiles could've
gotten rid of Sonic so easily.

227
00:20:45,925 --> 00:20:46,892
I told you!

228
00:20:46,926 --> 00:20:49,451
It's coming back at you, Black Eggman!

229
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:02,997
Sonic!

230
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,634
Damn!

231
00:21:16,255 --> 00:21:17,722
Damn it!

232
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:21,220
You might have the fastest feet
in the world,

233
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,024
but if you can't run,
you're just a normal hedgehog.

234
00:21:24,063 --> 00:21:27,794
You will never make it to Eggmanland!

235
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,692
Try to run away from this!

236
00:21:30,736 --> 00:21:33,967
Sonic, I'll save you!

237
00:21:42,181 --> 00:21:43,170
Knuckles!

238
00:21:43,215 --> 00:21:45,547
Hurry and save Sonic!

239
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,822
I'ts no good! If my tails are stuck together,
I can't fly!

240
00:21:53,092 --> 00:21:53,820
I've got it!

241
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,924
Sonic, grab onto this!

242
00:21:57,963 --> 00:21:59,658
Who are you?

243
00:22:03,102 --> 00:22:05,627
Sonic, you can do it!

244
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,738
Damn!

245
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:19,043
Ah damn! I'm out of ammo! You're one lucky bastard, aren't you?
However...

246
00:22:19,084 --> 00:22:20,381
Not lucky enough!

247
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:36,201
Thank you, Knuckles.

248
00:22:36,235 --> 00:22:37,759
Right back at you.

249
00:22:39,705 --> 00:22:41,900
It doesn't matter.

250
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,069
You're running away?

251
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:48,375
I won't forgive you,
Black Eggman!

252
00:22:48,414 --> 00:22:52,077
Don't worry, we'll meet again soon!

253
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:54,677
Grab onto me, Sonic!

254
00:23:26,318 --> 00:23:28,548
Damn you, bastard Sonic!

255
00:23:28,587 --> 00:23:33,581
He'd better enjoy this feeling now,
because once he gets to Eggmanland,

256
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:36,788
he'll have to fight something
even worse than Black Eggman!

257
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:38,626
What do you mean, worse than Black
Eggman?

258
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,128
You're talking about yourself!

259
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:43,623
You'd better keep your hands off my
Sonic, or I'll never forgive you!

260
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,571
Thanks for saving us there, Knuckles.

261
00:23:49,608 --> 00:23:52,236
Yeah, that's one more job that I'm
not going to get paid for.

262
00:23:52,277 --> 00:23:54,973
Oh well, we've been friends
for long enough.

263
00:23:55,013 --> 00:23:56,207
I guess I can just put this on your tab.

264
00:23:56,248 --> 00:23:58,341
So will you return to treasure hunting?

265
00:23:58,383 --> 00:24:02,046
Of course!
After all, that's what I live for!

266
00:24:08,093 --> 00:24:11,426
The sun's already setting!
We've got to hurry!

267
00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:13,192
What is that thing?

268
00:24:20,506 --> 00:24:21,837
That's Eggmanland!

269
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:24,001
Incredible!

270
00:24:40,726 --> 00:24:42,990
I hope we see you again, Knuckles!

271
00:24:43,028 --> 00:24:43,892
See you.

272
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,090
See you later!

273
00:24:50,736 --> 00:24:51,896
Knuckles!

274
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:56,704
Hey, I'd worry about you two if
I sent you in alone! See you!

275
00:24:57,376 --> 00:25:01,608
What are you waiting for? If you don't
hurry, that thing's going to explode!

276
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,143
Wait up, Knuckles!

277
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:24,325
So this must be the entrance
to Eggmanland.

278
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:27,736
I never expected Eggman to live
in such an awesome place!

279
00:25:27,773 --> 00:25:30,241
This is no time to be blown away.

280
00:25:30,275 --> 00:25:32,470
You're right. Come on, let's go!

281
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:38,879
It's this way.
Keep going straight ahead, Sonic!

282
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,043
Got it!

283
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:42,910
I'm really starting to get excited
about this, Sonic.

284
00:25:42,955 --> 00:25:46,118
Just don't let your guard down or
you'll seriously regret it, Knuckles.

285
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:47,352
I'll be fine.

286
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:00,565
Sonic, leave these guys to me
and go on ahead!

287
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:02,597
All right! Good luck!

288
00:26:18,991 --> 00:26:20,720
Tails, fly! You have to fly!

289
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:22,249
Yeah, right!

290
00:26:23,528 --> 00:26:25,257
It's too heavy for me to move!

291
00:26:33,005 --> 00:26:34,939
Hang on! I'll stop this thing!

292
00:26:55,594 --> 00:26:56,583
Sonic!

293
00:26:56,628 --> 00:26:58,653
I'll have you out of there in no time!

294
00:27:11,276 --> 00:27:13,437
Whoa!

295
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:26,490
Sonic, are you all right?

296
00:27:44,276 --> 00:27:45,937
Something's moving!

297
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:12,600
It's a robot that looks
exactly like Sonic!

298
00:28:13,472 --> 00:28:15,463
What does all this mean?

299
00:28:29,454 --> 00:28:30,682
What is that?

300
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,852
It's pretty!

301
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:55,012
Black Eggman's ghost!

302
00:29:24,342 --> 00:29:25,832
It's broken.

303
00:29:26,745 --> 00:29:28,007
Watch where you're putting your hands!

304
00:29:28,046 --> 00:29:29,308
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to!

305
00:29:29,347 --> 00:29:31,315
Ow! Stop it, Seira!

306
00:29:31,349 --> 00:29:32,839
Please stop, Seira!

307
00:29:35,187 --> 00:29:36,313
Seira!

308
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,821
Why are Seira and Eggman
here together?

309
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:44,158
I get it, you're Black Eggman!

310
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:49,666
It wasn't Seira's fault!

311
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,135
Look at that, now you've made her cry.

312
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:56,300
Black Eggman and the haywire
generator were all part of his scheme.

313
00:29:56,341 --> 00:29:58,832
Dr. Eggman planned the whole thing to trap you!

314
00:29:58,877 --> 00:30:00,344
What does all this mean, Eggman?

315
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:05,047
I don't believe you fell for my trap
and made it all the way here.

316
00:30:05,083 --> 00:30:08,484
Now this will be your burial place!
Good job, Sonic!

317
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,351
What did you say?

318
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:21,631
No way!

319
00:30:23,435 --> 00:30:27,633
This is the greatest invention of
Dr. Eggman, scientist extraordinaire!

320
00:30:27,672 --> 00:30:30,266
I call it Hyper Metal Sonic.

321
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:31,366
Pretty good, don't you think?

322
00:30:31,409 --> 00:30:33,468
You might have made a robot
that looks like him,

323
00:30:33,512 --> 00:30:35,377
but he's no match for the real Sonic!

324
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:39,277
Tails, it should be apparent to you.

325
00:30:39,317 --> 00:30:42,514
Sonic wasn't being electrocuted earlier.

326
00:30:42,554 --> 00:30:45,990
Instead, I was transferring all
his data to the robot.

327
00:30:46,024 --> 00:30:52,896
He is the fastest, most powerful battle
machine every to walk Planet Freedom!

328
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:55,729
What are you planning on doing
with that thing?

329
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:57,200
Isn't it obvious?

330
00:30:57,235 --> 00:30:59,703
I'm going to use Metal to destroy
the real Sonic,

331
00:30:59,738 --> 00:31:01,535
and then I'm going to destroy
the Land of the Sky.

332
00:31:01,573 --> 00:31:02,835
What did you say?

333
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:05,240
There's no way you'll get
away with this!

334
00:31:07,445 --> 00:31:09,413
Let Seira go, Eggman!

335
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,374
Tell me that after you've defeated him.

336
00:31:13,418 --> 00:31:18,185
Go get him, Hyper Metal Sonic!

337
00:31:18,823 --> 00:31:21,587
Tails, Knuckles, don't try to help me.

338
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:23,253
I want to take him out on my own!

339
00:31:43,381 --> 00:31:46,009
Man, he's fast! This is the first time
I've ever seen Sonic like this!

340
00:31:50,522 --> 00:31:52,615
Incredible! Absolutely incredible!

341
00:31:52,657 --> 00:31:58,027
That is an invention worthy of being
called Dr. Eggman's greatest creation ever!

342
00:32:04,502 --> 00:32:07,027
He's in trouble! Sonic!

343
00:32:17,515 --> 00:32:19,415
Keep going, Metal Sonic!

344
00:32:26,024 --> 00:32:27,150
Sonic!

345
00:32:27,192 --> 00:32:28,591
Wait, Tails!

346
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:31,986
Sonic!

347
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,463
Hold up, Tails!

348
00:32:33,498 --> 00:32:34,726
But if we don't hurry then Sonic...

349
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:36,393
Calm down, Tails!

350
00:32:36,434 --> 00:32:38,629
There's no way that either one of
us can catch up with them.

351
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:40,433
We've got to think of another way!

352
00:32:43,408 --> 00:32:44,841
What?

353
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:55,017
That's right.

354
00:32:55,053 --> 00:32:57,521
He did say something about destroying
the Land of the Sky, didn't he?

355
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:05,563
I'm sorry,
was that uncomfortable, Seira?

356
00:33:05,597 --> 00:33:09,226
Come on, don't be mad.
Just stay with me a little bit longer.

357
00:33:09,267 --> 00:33:11,633
No, I wanna go home now!

358
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:13,570
If you just wait a few more minutes,

359
00:33:13,605 --> 00:33:15,937
I'll show you something
really spectacular.

360
00:33:25,417 --> 00:33:27,078
Where did he go?

361
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:55,840
That's it!

362
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,243
Perfect! Perfect!

363
00:33:59,284 --> 00:34:03,050
That damn bastard Sonic has finally been defeated!

364
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:05,723
Tails!

365
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:08,058
Hey, Tails, what's wrong with you?

366
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:09,321
That's a warp zone right in front of us!

367
00:34:09,361 --> 00:34:11,693
We're catching the tornado,
and we're going home!

368
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,960
Hey, hey, what about Sonic?

369
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:27,842
What a nice, peaceful night.

370
00:34:31,616 --> 00:34:35,347
Sonic, you're back already?

371
00:34:38,923 --> 00:34:41,983
Sonic, what's the matter?

372
00:34:43,895 --> 00:34:46,227
Please stop it!

373
00:34:59,177 --> 00:35:01,168
Where am I?

374
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,412
Tails...

375
00:35:03,848 --> 00:35:06,248
I remember leaving Eggmanland.

376
00:35:12,791 --> 00:35:14,656
It can't be?! That bastard Metal!

377
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:23,397
Is this all part of Black
Eggman's plan, too?

378
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:25,193
Geez!

379
00:35:26,171 --> 00:35:29,572
The only one that would do
something like this is Eggman!

380
00:35:30,308 --> 00:35:32,799
It's a lucky thing no one
was staying here.

381
00:35:34,679 --> 00:35:36,340
That old man was watching
the house for us!

382
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:39,675
Old man! Old man!

383
00:35:40,218 --> 00:35:42,516
It doesn't look like anyone touched
the inside of this place.

384
00:35:43,688 --> 00:35:45,952
Old man, where are you?

385
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,651
Tails, is that you?

386
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:49,319
Are you back already?

387
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:52,990
Those are Sonic's favorite clothes!

388
00:35:53,031 --> 00:35:54,521
Don't blame me if he gets mad at you!

389
00:35:54,566 --> 00:35:56,227
Don't worry about it.

390
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:57,700
Sonic came back last night.

391
00:35:57,735 --> 00:36:02,035
He forced me to put on these clothes
and then he just flew away.

392
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,334
He flew away?

393
00:36:05,109 --> 00:36:06,133
It's Metal!

394
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:10,505
Metal is really wreaking havoc here.

395
00:36:10,548 --> 00:36:14,314
At the rate he's going, the Land of the
Sky won't last more than a few hours.

396
00:36:14,352 --> 00:36:17,219
Now I can take my plan
to the next stage.

397
00:36:17,255 --> 00:36:20,224
Here you go, Seira.
This is a present for you.

398
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:22,055
Yahoo! You rock!

399
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:28,126
Tails, stop tinkering with that thing!

400
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,997
Let's hurry up and find Sonic!

401
00:36:30,034 --> 00:36:31,331
Hold on a second.

402
00:36:31,369 --> 00:36:34,827
This machine that Eggman gave
me and Metal Sonic

403
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,034
are built out of the same
kinds of parts.

404
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:38,838
I think I can use that.

405
00:36:38,877 --> 00:36:41,675
Really? You might be able to
find Metal Sonic?

406
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:45,240
But what if Metal Sonic and Sonic aren't
in the same place any more?

407
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:48,582
Don't worry. Sonic and Metal
will definitely be together.

408
00:36:49,954 --> 00:36:52,650
I don't get it. How come?

409
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:57,127
Well, all of Sonic's data was
input into Metal's memory.

410
00:36:57,161 --> 00:37:00,961
His personality, his likes, his
dislikes, even all his thoughts.

411
00:37:00,999 --> 00:37:03,229
That's why he knew to come here.

412
00:37:03,268 --> 00:37:06,465
He even gave the old man
his favorite clothes.

413
00:37:06,504 --> 00:37:09,268
I understand that,
but Metal's still a robot.

414
00:37:09,307 --> 00:37:11,207
Even if he is a robot,

415
00:37:11,242 --> 00:37:14,268
Metal is operating on Sonic's
thoughts and motivations.

416
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:19,045
He knows everything that Sonic's
ever seen or felt.

417
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:20,710
The same goes for Sonic.

418
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:24,584
In other words,
it's just like they're twins.

419
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:27,023
They're twins, huh?

420
00:37:27,859 --> 00:37:29,884
Green Lake City has been flooded!

421
00:37:29,928 --> 00:37:31,520
Forest Town is currently on fire!

422
00:37:32,196 --> 00:37:35,290
We've discovered the source
of the disturbances.

423
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:35,958
We'll patch it through to the monitors.

424
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:40,795
Sonic!

425
00:37:41,239 --> 00:37:42,228
It can't be!

426
00:37:43,041 --> 00:37:45,532
Get Sonic's house
on the line immediately.

427
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:46,566
Yes, Sir.

428
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:51,707
Shut up already, I'm busy!

429
00:37:51,749 --> 00:37:53,148
Isn't somebody going to pick that up?

430
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:56,950
Hey, Tails! Isn't anyone there?

431
00:37:58,222 --> 00:38:01,658
Ahhh, not that bastard!
What the heck is he doing now?

432
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,791
Hey, it's me! Listen to me right now!

433
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:07,320
Shut up! Who are you?

434
00:38:07,365 --> 00:38:08,593
Who are YOU?

435
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:11,295
I'm Knuckles, Sonic's best friend.

436
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:13,361
I see. Is Sonic there?

437
00:38:13,404 --> 00:38:14,530
Is Seira safe?

438
00:38:14,572 --> 00:38:16,096
What happened to Black Eggman?

439
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,869
Did you stop the generator?

440
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:20,673
You sure are an annoying old man.
I'm busy here!

441
00:38:20,712 --> 00:38:23,180
Mr. President!

442
00:38:25,984 --> 00:38:28,077
Look, Eggman, don't Seira look cute?

443
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:30,781
Yes, it suits you very well, Seira.

444
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,555
But why did you give me a wedding dress?

445
00:38:33,591 --> 00:38:35,024
What do you mean?

446
00:38:35,059 --> 00:38:39,655
Once Metal has destroyed the Land
of the Sky, it'll just be the two of us.

447
00:38:39,697 --> 00:38:43,861
Then we can get married and live the
rest of our lives together, Seira!

448
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,172
Go to sleep, go to sleep,
close your eyes...

449
00:38:54,312 --> 00:38:55,870
Are you crazy?

450
00:38:55,913 --> 00:38:57,972
Who told you I wanted to
marry you anyway?

451
00:38:58,016 --> 00:38:59,916
I won't do it! Never!

452
00:39:00,985 --> 00:39:02,782
So that's what really happened.

453
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,190
But I still don't think it will enough
to destroy the Land of the Sky.

454
00:39:08,226 --> 00:39:09,750
It's possible.

455
00:39:09,794 --> 00:39:13,457
I've traveled all over the subterranean
levels of this planet,

456
00:39:13,498 --> 00:39:15,227
and I've seen it.

457
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:17,860
At the northernmost tip
of this continent,

458
00:39:17,902 --> 00:39:21,895
all the continents in the Land of the
Sky are linked by a huge glacier.

459
00:39:22,807 --> 00:39:26,243
Many rivers of magma run beneath
the surface of the continents.

460
00:39:26,277 --> 00:39:29,246
They're shaped like blood vessels
under the glacier.

461
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,875
If the tip of this glacier were ever
punctured by an explosion,

462
00:39:32,917 --> 00:39:36,478
the magma would pour directly into
the glacier, melting all the ice.

463
00:39:36,521 --> 00:39:39,354
What do you think will happen if the
continents lose all their support?

464
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,360
Due to the centrifugal force
of the planet,

465
00:39:46,397 --> 00:39:49,093
they'll be thrown into outer space.

466
00:39:54,238 --> 00:39:56,035
This is impossible!

467
00:39:56,074 --> 00:39:59,805
Mr. President, please don't tell Sonic
a word about any of this!

468
00:39:59,844 --> 00:40:01,175
I know that!

469
00:40:01,212 --> 00:40:03,544
Why am I not supposed to be told
about this, Tails?

470
00:40:03,581 --> 00:40:05,572
Sonic, you're safe!

471
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:09,219
It's too late. I heard all of it.

472
00:40:09,253 --> 00:40:11,585
Sonic, you don't understand!
Let me explain!

473
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:15,248
Metal Sonic has turned northward
and is moving at top speed.

474
00:40:15,893 --> 00:40:16,882
What did you say?

475
00:40:18,229 --> 00:40:20,493
Metal is planning to melt
the glaciers to the north!

476
00:40:20,531 --> 00:40:22,556
We must stop him at any cost!

477
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,589
Roger!

478
00:40:27,171 --> 00:40:28,297
Sonic.

479
00:40:29,507 --> 00:40:32,169
Tails, Sonic just disappeared.

480
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,768
He must have gone after Metal.

481
00:40:33,811 --> 00:40:34,971
He went north!

482
00:40:35,012 --> 00:40:36,980
We'll have to do our best too.

483
00:40:37,014 --> 00:40:39,005
We have to stop Metal no matter what!

484
00:40:39,884 --> 00:40:41,875
He's headed to the North Pole.

485
00:40:41,919 --> 00:40:45,514
That means Metal has finally found
the point of destruction.

486
00:40:45,556 --> 00:40:47,217
Here we go, Seira!

487
00:40:47,258 --> 00:40:48,589
No, no!

488
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:50,253
I don't want to get married
at the North Pole!

489
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:53,525
Why me? Hold on tight,
we're about to hit a warp zone.

490
00:40:53,564 --> 00:40:56,533
No! I told you to stop! Stop!

491
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,293
All right!

492
00:41:01,339 --> 00:41:04,274
Now we have to access Metal's memory
banks and adjust them.

493
00:41:04,308 --> 00:41:06,970
Then maybe we can awaken Sonic's
personality in him!

494
00:41:07,011 --> 00:41:10,003
Tails, are you sure we can
trust that thing?

495
00:41:10,047 --> 00:41:11,912
After all, it used to be Eggman's.

496
00:41:11,949 --> 00:41:13,314
Don't worry about it.

497
00:41:13,351 --> 00:41:15,376
Just keep your eyes open for Sonic.

498
00:41:15,419 --> 00:41:16,852
I know what to do!

499
00:42:00,431 --> 00:42:02,456
Damn it, I'm too late.

500
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:05,060
Where is that bastard?
He's got to be around here somewhere!

501
00:42:05,603 --> 00:42:06,592
What?

502
00:42:11,175 --> 00:42:12,904
Then this will be the real fight.

503
00:42:12,944 --> 00:42:15,606
We'll fight until only one of us is
left standing, all right, Metal?

504
00:42:17,148 --> 00:42:21,278
What? This world isn't big enough for
two Sonic's, you say?

505
00:42:22,854 --> 00:42:24,685
Well, the feeling's mutual.

506
00:42:45,576 --> 00:42:48,067
You might know everything I'm
going to do,

507
00:42:48,112 --> 00:42:51,138
but I know everything you're
going to do too!

508
00:42:51,182 --> 00:42:53,013
It's really a strange feeling!

509
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:07,221
Sonic, you're still alive?

510
00:43:07,265 --> 00:43:09,563
Sonic, what's wrong with you?

511
00:43:10,801 --> 00:43:13,167
You pervert!
Get away, you little piece of tin!

512
00:43:13,204 --> 00:43:16,139
I get it, you synchronized
yourself with Metal.

513
00:43:16,173 --> 00:43:18,664
This is my chance!

514
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:22,803
Seira!

515
00:43:22,947 --> 00:43:26,041
Sonic!

516
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,744
Oh no, my Seira!

517
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,152
That was close!

518
00:43:31,188 --> 00:43:32,246
Knuckles!

519
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:33,780
Sonic!

520
00:43:40,064 --> 00:43:43,033
You're a perfect target for me now, damn fox!

521
00:43:48,472 --> 00:43:49,939
Ready, aim...

522
00:43:49,974 --> 00:43:52,408
Fire Eggman missiles!

523
00:43:57,281 --> 00:43:58,908
Gotcha!

524
00:44:01,953 --> 00:44:04,285
Oh no, another design failure!

525
00:44:04,322 --> 00:44:07,086
That's all right. More importantly,
what happened to Seira?

526
00:44:07,124 --> 00:44:09,024
Oh man, I can't stop!

527
00:44:09,994 --> 00:44:12,895
You saved Seira! Thank you, Mr. Mole!

528
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,660
Somebody stop me please!

529
00:44:18,736 --> 00:44:21,364
Seira have more power than she thought she did!

530
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:24,306
There you are Seira.
It's time for you to come with me now.

531
00:44:24,342 --> 00:44:25,900
Look out!

532
00:44:30,448 --> 00:44:31,506
Tails!

533
00:44:32,316 --> 00:44:33,442
Sorry!

534
00:44:33,484 --> 00:44:35,418
Tails, I didn't think you'd
stoop that low.

535
00:44:37,355 --> 00:44:39,220
Damn it! It's that bastard Metal!

536
00:44:39,256 --> 00:44:40,245
Sonic!

537
00:44:43,861 --> 00:44:45,556
Stop it, Metal!

538
00:44:56,374 --> 00:44:59,400
If that ice bridge is destroyed,
then we're dead!

539
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:01,343
Knuckles, see what you can
do about the magma!

540
00:45:02,046 --> 00:45:03,138
Well...

541
00:45:03,748 --> 00:45:06,046
Come on, you're a real man, aren't you?

542
00:45:08,519 --> 00:45:09,679
Right!

543
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:14,682
Here we go!

544
00:45:22,666 --> 00:45:25,362
You're totally cool, Mr. Mole!
Good job, Knuckles! You stopped it!

545
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:28,438
My hat's on fire! Hot! Hot!

546
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,523
Sonic!

547
00:45:51,562 --> 00:45:53,359
What the heck do you think you're doing?

548
00:45:53,397 --> 00:45:56,730
Why is this stupid thing that looks like
Sonic causing so much trouble?

549
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,359
Oh, that's right!

550
00:46:01,105 --> 00:46:02,834
I hope this works!

551
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:09,039
No! If you destroy the Land of the Sky,
then Seira have to marry Eggman!

552
00:46:10,081 --> 00:46:12,015
Take that! And that! And that!

553
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:13,539
Hurry!

554
00:46:16,087 --> 00:46:17,054
Got it!

555
00:46:21,892 --> 00:46:23,484
Now, Sonic!

556
00:46:27,998 --> 00:46:29,226
Sonic!

557
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:31,427
Good work, Tails! You saved us!

558
00:46:34,505 --> 00:46:35,597
Who is that!?

559
00:46:35,639 --> 00:46:37,266
It doesn't look like Eggman.

560
00:46:37,842 --> 00:46:39,173
That's papa's rocket!

561
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:40,541
What did you say!?

562
00:46:43,013 --> 00:46:46,005
What? Is the door stuck?

563
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:49,451
We're in trouble! The heat from the
lava could cause it to explode!

564
00:46:50,387 --> 00:46:51,854
Seira, you wait here.

565
00:46:51,889 --> 00:46:53,186
Come on, let's go!

566
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,252
Papa!

567
00:46:57,461 --> 00:46:59,429
Of all the pointless stunts...

568
00:46:59,463 --> 00:47:00,589
I know.

569
00:47:00,631 --> 00:47:02,622
If that thing explodes right there,
we'll all be in trouble.

570
00:47:04,435 --> 00:47:05,367
Sonic!

571
00:47:08,506 --> 00:47:11,236
Get out of my way, Metal!

572
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:17,469
Damn it!

573
00:47:17,515 --> 00:47:19,039
Sonic!

574
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,519
I'll take care of Eggman, and you get
the President out of there!

575
00:47:25,089 --> 00:47:26,181
Eggman!

576
00:47:26,223 --> 00:47:29,886
Trying to overload him by making him
assimilate Sonic's personality?

577
00:47:29,927 --> 00:47:31,258
Impressive, Tails.

578
00:47:31,295 --> 00:47:32,819
But you're too late.

579
00:47:34,098 --> 00:47:35,861
Metal, hurry and destroy Sonic!

580
00:48:25,316 --> 00:48:26,613
Hurry! Hurry!

581
00:48:26,884 --> 00:48:28,852
I know! Shut up already!

582
00:48:36,961 --> 00:48:37,893
Damn!

583
00:48:38,329 --> 00:48:39,660
Papa!

584
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,121
Mr. President!

585
00:48:44,168 --> 00:48:46,295
Old man!

586
00:48:48,372 --> 00:48:49,464
Sonic!

587
00:48:49,974 --> 00:48:51,236
Sonic, are you all right?

588
00:48:52,142 --> 00:48:53,507
Metal?

589
00:48:58,148 --> 00:49:01,174
Don't do it, Sonic! What are you doing?

590
00:49:01,218 --> 00:49:02,685
Sonic!

591
00:49:16,634 --> 00:49:18,431
Grab onto my hand!

592
00:49:19,403 --> 00:49:22,566
Don't do it, Sonic!
He'll drag you under with him!

593
00:49:33,517 --> 00:49:37,146
There is only one Sonic...

594
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:43,660
Metal!

595
00:49:43,694 --> 00:49:45,127
Don't do it, Sonic!

596
00:49:51,068 --> 00:49:53,195
Metal!

597
00:50:10,721 --> 00:50:14,020
Come on, don't look so sad, Sonic.
It's not like you at all.

598
00:50:14,058 --> 00:50:17,960
She's right! It was thanks to you
that the planet was saved!

599
00:50:20,264 --> 00:50:21,288
Eggman!

600
00:50:21,332 --> 00:50:24,324
You damn fools!
I still have all of Sonic's data!

601
00:50:25,169 --> 00:50:30,664
Next time, I'll build a stronger Metal
that won't have Sonic's personality.

602
00:50:30,708 --> 00:50:35,304
And then I, Dr. Eggman, will finally take
over the entire planet!

603
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:40,645
It must be humbling to be in the
presence of one so great as Eggman!

604
00:50:40,684 --> 00:50:43,312
What are you doing? Stop!

605
00:50:48,192 --> 00:50:50,990
It's finally over.
Thank goodness everything's all right!

606
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:52,962
Almost, but not quite.

607
00:50:52,996 --> 00:50:54,827
Why the heck did you do that!?

608
00:50:54,865 --> 00:50:57,129
So now we're finally even, Sonic.

609
00:50:58,268 --> 00:50:59,565
What do you mean?

610
00:50:59,603 --> 00:51:01,036
Wait, Knuckles!

611
00:51:01,071 --> 00:51:03,562
Hey, Sonic, wait up!

612
00:51:03,607 --> 00:51:05,074
Why the hell did you hit me!?

613
00:51:05,109 --> 00:51:07,703
I was getting you back for
stepping on my head!

614
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:09,007
I don't remember doing that!

615
00:51:09,046 --> 00:51:10,013
You did!

616
00:51:10,047 --> 00:51:11,309
I don't remember!

617
00:51:11,849 --> 00:51:14,340
Damn it!
You're not going to get away from me, damn Sonic!

618
00:51:14,385 --> 00:51:16,376
I'll get your data again!

619
00:51:17,254 --> 00:51:18,846
What? What?

620
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:22,450
What the heck are you doing, Eggman?
Hurry up and catch Sonic!

621
00:51:22,493 --> 00:51:25,621
Of course I will! Hang on!

622
00:51:28,132 --> 00:51:34,071
Wait, come back! Marry me! Sonic!
Sonic, I'll get your data again!

623
00:51:34,104 --> 00:51:36,595
I'm outta here!
I'll see you later, Knuckles!

624
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:38,574
Hey, wait up, Sonic!

625
00:51:39,305 --> 00:52:39,651
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
