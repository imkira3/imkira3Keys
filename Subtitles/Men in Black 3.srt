1
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:01,604
Well, well,
Boris the Animal has a visitor.

2
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,065
I guess one every 40 years is okay.

3
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:08,570
It's a cake.

4
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:10,822
I decide what it is.

5
00:01:14,284 --> 00:01:15,952
Looks like some kind of cake.

6
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:20,832
She's clean.
Well, not clean, but you know...

7
00:01:57,869 --> 00:01:59,621
Oh, God.

8
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,422
Boris the Animal...

9
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,466
...you've got a visitor.

10
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:15,011
It's just Boris.

11
00:02:20,975 --> 00:02:23,853
Your letters have been
a soul-nourishing...

12
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:24,771
...tonic.

13
00:02:26,606 --> 00:02:29,651
And you are much more...

14
00:02:29,817 --> 00:02:34,364
...unconventionally handsome
than your photos.

15
00:02:44,374 --> 00:02:46,125
This ain't a conjugal visit.

16
00:02:46,292 --> 00:02:47,669
So quit your conjugating.

17
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,131
When's the last time
you conjugated anything?

18
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:54,634
I see you've brought me a treat,
darling.

19
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:57,929
Would you mind cutting this up
for us? It's a special day.

20
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,765
I'm a romantic like that.

21
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,480
Oh, I wouldn't do that.

22
00:03:07,647 --> 00:03:08,314
Why's that?

23
00:03:08,481 --> 00:03:10,233
It'll ruin your figure.

24
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,530
You complete me.

25
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,425
The big one.

26
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:24,724
Boris! You promised
to take me with you!

27
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:25,975
We had a deal!

28
00:04:28,352 --> 00:04:30,354
Obadiah Price.

29
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:35,151
Yes. I did make you a promise.

30
00:04:43,743 --> 00:04:46,454
Wait. I smell something.

31
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:54,212
You can't win, Boris.

32
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,172
Let's agree to disagree.

33
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,256
There's too many of us.

34
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:01,177
Rather hot in here.
Mind if I open a window?

35
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,074
Sorry, darling.
We did love the cake.

36
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,392
Let's rewrite history, shall we, K?

37
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,038
Good afternoon.

38
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:13,916
Please give your attention
to my associate, Agent J.

39
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,711
He's going to demonstrate
an electro-biomechanical...

40
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,505
...neural-transmitting,
zero-synapse repositioner.

41
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:20,882
We call it the neuralyser.

42
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,342
- Keep it simple, slick.
- Thanks a lot.

43
00:06:23,593 --> 00:06:24,635
Thank you, Agent K.

44
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,096
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you will look right here.

45
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:33,853
You know how you're on a plane and
you're asked to turn your phone off?

46
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:37,231
You're like, "I ain't turning it off.
Has nothing to do with a plane."

47
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:39,817
Well, this is what we get.
That's what happens.

48
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:43,195
It gets up there, bounces around
on the satellites and:

49
00:06:43,362 --> 00:06:44,780
Just turn your damn phone off.

50
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:48,242
Now you're gonna drive off a cliff
tonight because your GPS don't work.

51
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:52,455
Check the composition
of the fuel units and surface deposits.

52
00:06:52,622 --> 00:06:53,998
I wanna know who was driving.

53
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:55,583
Yes, sir.

54
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,960
- What are you gonna say tonight?
- Don't worry.

55
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,962
No, I'm very worried.
This is important.

56
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,840
- I'm hungry. You hungry?
- K.

57
00:07:03,007 --> 00:07:05,676
Seriously,
I'm not even sure that's meat.

58
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:09,180
I think I just saw a tooth in that thing.
Or a claw. Or a hoof.

59
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:10,848
Thanks, Manny.

60
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:13,517
That does not belong in a pita,
it belongs in a casket.

61
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:15,895
What would go good with this
would be silence.

62
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:17,229
See, here's the problem.

63
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:18,564
You can't smell it...

64
00:07:18,731 --> 00:07:21,817
...because your nose already
smells like that, but my nose doesn't.

65
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:26,030
Silence goes good with a lot of things.
Ever try or is talking how you breathe?

66
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,866
Just say you hate me.
Don't take it out on the car.

67
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:30,409
Let me enjoy this.

68
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,203
Whoa, enjoyment.

69
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,748
So that's what enjoyment looks like
on that face. I like that emotion.

70
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,125
I keep emotion out of it.

71
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:40,795
Out of what, K? Life?

72
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,590
You don't wanna run it by me?

73
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:46,717
- Let me know what you'll say?
- Don't worry.

74
00:07:46,884 --> 00:07:49,303
Oh, no, I'm worried. Very worried.

75
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,889
It's the man's eulogy.
You have to show some feeling.

76
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,601
That thing people do when they
change their facial expression?

77
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,854
I worked with Zed for 40 years.
A hell of an agent.

78
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,941
And I have written
a hell of a speech for him.

79
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,526
People will be moved.

80
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:26,507
And now a few words from Agent K.

81
00:08:27,049 --> 00:08:29,927
I worked with Zed for over 40 years,
and in all that time...

82
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,721
...he never invited me to dinner.

83
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:35,641
He never asked me to his house
to watch a game.

84
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:39,895
He never shared a single detail
of his personal life.

85
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,314
Yeah, he was weird.

86
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:48,738
Thank you.

87
00:08:50,698 --> 00:08:53,951
And now we will hear from
our new chief, Agent O.

88
00:08:54,118 --> 00:08:56,412
Thank you, Agent K.
That was very moving.

89
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:59,707
- That was your eulogy?
- He was a good man.

90
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:03,002
Ladies, gentlemen, other life forms.

91
00:09:03,419 --> 00:09:07,173
When I told the Finucian Zyglot
about Zed's passing...

92
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:09,592
...she said something
that I'm going to repeat.

93
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:11,802
And I'm paraphrasing.

94
00:09:35,451 --> 00:09:37,453
That's just so Zed.

95
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,663
Thank you.

96
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:53,344
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

97
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:57,098
Can you promise, if I go first, you'll
do better than that at my funeral?

98
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,308
You know, something like:

99
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:01,352
"J was a friend.

100
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,522
Now there's a big part of me
that's gone.

101
00:10:04,688 --> 00:10:08,025
Oh, J, all the things
that I should have said...

102
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,444
...except I was too old...

103
00:10:10,611 --> 00:10:12,404
...and craggy and surly...

104
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:14,865
...and just tight. I was too...

105
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,575
...tight.

106
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:20,663
I'm gonna just miss
your caramel-brown skin."

107
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,540
I'll wing something.

108
00:10:24,834 --> 00:10:28,629
<i>K, it's O. We have reports</i>
<i>of several humans suffering from...</i>

109
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:31,549
<i>...intestinal worms of alien origin.</i>

110
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:32,758
Thank you, O.

111
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:36,095
How did you get to be like you?

112
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:38,055
Something happened, K.
What happened?

113
00:10:38,514 --> 00:10:40,307
You know how I live
such a happy life'?

114
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:43,352
How you live such a happy life?

115
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:46,438
I don't ask questions
I don't want to know the answer to.

116
00:10:47,773 --> 00:10:49,191
That's deep.

117
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:01,745
Jeffrey.

118
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:05,332
Do I know you?

119
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:10,004
Your services are legendary.
So says your father, Obadiah.

120
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:11,839
You were in Lunar-Max.

121
00:11:12,006 --> 00:11:15,593
There is no prison that can hold me.

122
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:19,138
Cool for you.
What do you need from me, man?

123
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,598
The device.

124
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:25,352
I'm going back in time to kill a man
before he takes my arm.

125
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:42,786
K, J!

126
00:11:42,995 --> 00:11:46,540
So happy to see you.
Mr. Wu get you your regular table?

127
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:55,132
You no hungry?

128
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:56,383
Show us the tanks, Wu.

129
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:59,803
Oh, sure, sure. You look.
Very fresh.

130
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,722
Show us the tanks in the back.

131
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:05,184
So sorry. No speak English.
You come back later, okay?

132
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:07,645
Save the chop-socky bullshit
for the tourists, Wu.

133
00:12:10,773 --> 00:12:13,400
Hey, what you guys
wanna bust my balls for, huh?

134
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,110
You don't have no balls.

135
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,325
Man, you look like
you come from the planet...

136
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:22,576
...Damn.

137
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:26,622
And Bob here is a clear violation
of Health Ordinance 32:

138
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:30,167
Selling unlicensed extraterrestrial...

139
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:33,754
...food stuffs.

140
00:12:33,921 --> 00:12:35,339
That is an Earth fish.

141
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:38,008
Very traditional in China.
You arrest me...

142
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,218
...that's a hate crime!

143
00:12:39,385 --> 00:12:40,386
It would be...

144
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:42,137
...if you were Chinese.

145
00:12:42,972 --> 00:12:44,723
K, come on. I got larvae to feed.

146
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:48,060
Who is the Spiky Bulba for?

147
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,144
Nobody.

148
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:50,312
Who's it for?

149
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:51,480
I keep them in case!

150
00:12:51,647 --> 00:12:53,023
- In case what?
- I don't know!

151
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,108
anybody!

152
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:55,567
All right, you slug.

153
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,655
Wu...

154
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:03,409
...he and I are having issues right now,
but you shouldn't suffer for that.

155
00:13:03,575 --> 00:13:04,285
Thank you, J.

156
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,579
So if you don't like getting
fish-slapped, keep to our agreement.

157
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:10,374
Earth people get Earth fish.
Real Earth fish.

158
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,961
On behalf of my pathetic self
and worthless children, you stay.

159
00:13:14,128 --> 00:13:17,673
Allow me most honorable benefit
of serving you favourite noodles, K?

160
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,717
Don't nobody want your
nasty-ass noodles.

161
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,593
You're a piece of shit, Wu.

162
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:22,928
Shrimp and bok choy.

163
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,639
We're gonna be here for a while.

164
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:42,114
That was just mean.

165
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,700
What you did to Wu back there.

166
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:47,703
Snatched his skirt off.

167
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,872
That's just disrespectful.

168
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:51,874
I used to play a game
with my dad:

169
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:54,752
What'll You Have
For Your Last Meal.

170
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:57,379
You could do worse than this.

171
00:13:59,715 --> 00:14:00,883
Okay.

172
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:03,802
I played a game with my dad...

173
00:14:03,969 --> 00:14:05,012
...called catch.

174
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,681
Except I'd throw the ball
and it'd just hit the wall...

175
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,183
...because he wasn't there.

176
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:11,226
Don't badmouth your old man.

177
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:15,022
I'm not badmouthing him.
I just didn't really know him.

178
00:14:15,731 --> 00:14:16,732
It's not right.

179
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,942
Damn right it's not.
A boy needs a father.

180
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,320
Table one hasn't ordered a thing.
Table three...

181
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:23,238
...just drank his fourth cup...

182
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,699
...of duck sauce.

183
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:30,120
<i>K, the crashed ship...</i>

184
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,997
<i>...from this morning</i>

185
00:14:32,164 --> 00:14:32,831
Lunar-Max.

186
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:33,957
Boris the Animal.

187
00:14:34,124 --> 00:14:35,167
How did you know?

188
00:14:35,334 --> 00:14:36,794
He has a taste for Spiky Bulba.

189
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:38,504
<i>Give us a minute, chief.</i>

190
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,383
We're in a situation.

191
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:44,301
Oh, yeah.

192
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:46,512
I take the Chloropod.

193
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,805
You take the Tarantabee.

194
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:49,431
And the Hydronian over there.

195
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,682
I'll take the kitchen.

196
00:14:50,849 --> 00:14:52,476
Meet you on the street.

197
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:54,436
This is a very confusing time...

198
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:55,896
...in my life.

199
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:16,667
Hey.

200
00:15:31,849 --> 00:15:33,892
Keep your mouth closed,
keep your head down.

201
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:02,564
Hello, K.

202
00:17:05,901 --> 00:17:06,818
Boris the Animal.

203
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:09,571
It's just Boris.

204
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:13,825
You haven't changed very much.
I see the arm I shot off is still shot off.

205
00:17:14,535 --> 00:17:16,411
Yes, my arm.

206
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:20,999
We've thought about that moment...

207
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,710
...every day for the last 40 years.

208
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:25,921
Well, that's just not living a full life.

209
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,799
I can promise you
it will be longer than yours.

210
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:32,678
Lonelier too. Since you're
the last Boglodite standing.

211
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,680
We'll see about that.

212
00:17:34,846 --> 00:17:38,600
But first,
I want the pleasure of killing you.

213
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:39,893
Yo, K.

214
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:43,730
- Where the hell have you been?
- Fishing.

215
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:05,002
You don't know it, K,
but you're already dead.

216
00:18:10,841 --> 00:18:12,092
You all right?

217
00:18:23,604 --> 00:18:25,522
May I have everyone's attention,
please?

218
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:30,736
Thank you.

219
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,989
You know how your kid won
the goldfish in that little baggie...

220
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:36,742
...from the fair and you didn't
want it in your house...

221
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,370
...so you told your kid it ran away
when you flushed it down the toilet?

222
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,039
Well, this is what happens.

223
00:18:42,205 --> 00:18:45,417
Okay? See what I'm talking about?
Don't lie to your kids.

224
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:54,301
Man, I am getting too old for this.

225
00:18:54,468 --> 00:18:56,803
I can only imagine how you feel.

226
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:59,056
Boris the Animal.

227
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:02,601
I put him away a long time ago.
It's the worst mistake I ever made.

228
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:04,853
Why? Was he innocent?

229
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,938
Should have killed him.

230
00:19:08,899 --> 00:19:11,109
- Well, shit, let's go get him.
- No.

231
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,070
- No.
- Leave it alone.

232
00:19:13,236 --> 00:19:14,446
It's above your pay grade.

233
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:16,365
We have the same pay grade.

234
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,451
It has nothing to do with you.
Mind your own business.

235
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,580
Okay, first of all, let's get a little bit
of that bass out your voice.

236
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:27,292
Secondly, as long as Spikey Boy is
running around, this is my business.

237
00:19:27,459 --> 00:19:29,836
You forget about Boris
or my report will reflect...

238
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:32,005
...that your conduct
has been unbecoming.

239
00:19:32,506 --> 00:19:35,509
Well, maybe my report
is gonna reflect some shit too, K.

240
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:38,178
- You are suspended for two weeks.
- Bullshit.

241
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:40,305
Four weeks.

242
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:42,557
How about I quit?

243
00:19:42,724 --> 00:19:44,976
There are things out there
you don't need to know.

244
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:48,188
That's not the lie you told me
when you recruited me.

245
00:19:58,448 --> 00:19:59,157
What up, pops?

246
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:01,993
- Lose your partner?
- Yeah.

That's easy.

279
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,639
K imprisoned Boris.
He put up the Arc Net.

He protected the Earth
from the Boglodites.

282

That's not what I'm asking.

283

A word of advice, Agent J.

289
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:18,129
Don't ask questions
you don't want to know the answer to.

290
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,635
That's funny.
That is exactly what K said.

00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:06,900
Exactly.
I feel like a whole new man today.

321
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:10,862
Like this great weight has been lifted.
I've had anger issues my entire life...

322
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,615
...but now I see I was mad at myself.
And my step mom.

323
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:15,784
Sir, I'm gonna need you
to stop talking.

324
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,244
It's like I closed
this emotional window.

325
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,455
But I threw a brick
through that window.

326
00:26:20,622 --> 00:26:22,499
Thank you for handing me
that brick, J.

327
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:26,336
Whoever you are, give me five feet
or I'll pluck you in your throat.

328
00:26:28,088 --> 00:26:30,465
I'm gonna go
to the little Men's-in-Black room...

329
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:34,177
...then we'll go find those morons
from Pox Ethera. Lunch is on me.

330
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,055
Who was that?

331
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:40,141
Double A? Your partner.

332
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:45,230
I need you to go get me some
chocolate milk, all right?

333
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:48,066
Just a really big glass.
Have you seen K?

334
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,776
Did he call in sick or anything?

335
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,402
Who's K?

336
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,823
All right, all right,
go ahead, go ahead.

337
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:55,740
K!

338
00:26:57,033 --> 00:26:58,159
All right.

339
00:26:58,451 --> 00:26:59,828
You got me.

340
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:02,247
I'll give it to you.
It's funny, very elaborate.

341
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,583
Oh, and all of you,
fantastic performances.

342
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,461
You waited 14 years
to develop a sense of humor...

343
00:27:08,628 --> 00:27:10,338
...but this is a good one.

344
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:12,340
But I need you
to come out here now...

345
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,926
...because I'm starting
to get a little pissed off.

346
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:17,387
Agent J, would you mind
keeping your voice down...

347
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,430
...and telling me
who you're looking for?

348
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,723
I'm looking for K.

349
00:27:21,141 --> 00:27:22,559
Who is K?

350
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:26,020
You too? You too.

351
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:28,148
I mean, who is he to you?

352
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,440
My partner.

353
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:32,110
Older gentleman, 110...

354
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:33,319
...maybe 111 years old.

355
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:38,449
Sort of a surly, Elvis thing happening
with him. He smiles like this.

356
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:40,743
Seen him around?

357
00:27:43,246 --> 00:27:44,747
I'll take you to K.

358
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,749
Thank you.

359
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:55,550
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's K.

360
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,802
He's been dead for over 40 years.

361
00:27:58,678 --> 00:28:02,390
Okay, see, the prerequisite for a joke
is that it be funny.

362
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:04,309
It's never been funny.

363
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:12,984
Computer, Agent K
and Boris the Animal.

364
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:15,862
<i>Men in Black incident report,</i>
<i>July, 1969.</i>

365
00:28:16,029 --> 00:28:17,197
<i>Location, Cape Canaveral.</i>

366
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,741
<i>Perpetrator Boris the Animal</i>
<i>escaped and fled Earth.</i>

367
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:23,161
<i>Assumed to have returned to planet</i>
<i>Boglodotia 20 light'-years away.</i>

368
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:26,664
<i>Agent K pronounced dead at scene.</i>
<i>Awarded posthumous commendation...</i>

369
00:28:26,831 --> 00:28:29,751
<i>...for action which prevented</i>
<i>greater loss of human life.</i>

370
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,419
That's not what happened.

371
00:28:31,586 --> 00:28:33,546
I looked at this report.
K put Boris away...

372
00:28:33,713 --> 00:28:36,674
- Agent K is dead.
- Well, I just talked to him last night.

373
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,259
- You are imagining.
- I'm not.

374
00:28:38,426 --> 00:28:40,386
- I need a psych team up here.
- Yes, ma'am.

375
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:44,390
Aqua Velva aftershave.
I didn't imagine that.

376
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:49,103
Every stakeout,
endless hours of cowboy music.

377
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,314
Every morning with his coffee...

378
00:28:51,481 --> 00:28:55,109
...he'd say, "I tell you something, slick.
This coffee tastes like dirt."

379
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:57,487
And I was supposed to say,
"What do you expect?

380
00:28:57,654 --> 00:28:59,447
- It was ground this morning."
- "This morning."

381
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,324
How do you know that?

382
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:02,867
Chocolate milk, sir?

383
00:29:03,034 --> 00:29:06,537
Where you been, man?
It was like an hour ago.

384
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:08,873
Wait.

385
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,918
How long have you been craving
chocolatised dairy products?

386
00:29:12,085 --> 00:29:13,461
Just today.

387
00:29:14,212 --> 00:29:16,256
Are you experiencing headaches?
Dizziness?

388
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:17,924
Loss of balance?

389
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:19,592
Agitation? Depression?

390
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:20,927
Hell, yeah.

391
00:29:22,428 --> 00:29:24,681
Two possibilities.
One is you've been bitten...

392
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,349
...by a Hovartian brain tick...

393
00:29:26,516 --> 00:29:28,977
...and could die in horrible agony
at any moment.

394
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:33,398
Damn it. It's not the tick.

395
00:29:33,564 --> 00:29:35,525
"Damn it, it's not the tick"?

396
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,360
It's something worse than the tick?

397
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,031
Your obsession
with chocolate milk indicates...

398
00:29:42,198 --> 00:29:44,784
...that you might be involved
in a temporal fracture.

399
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:46,786
I don't know
what you're talking about.

400
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,372
Chocolate milk relieves
temporal-fracture headaches.

401
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,207
What's a temporal fracture?

402
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:52,375
A break in the time line.

403
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:53,501
Don't know what you mean.

404
00:29:53,668 --> 00:29:55,503
Time travel! Time travel.

405
00:29:55,962 --> 00:29:57,880
There's no such thing
as time travel.

406
00:29:58,256 --> 00:29:59,716
- Well, there is.
- No.

407
00:29:59,882 --> 00:30:00,967
There's not.

408
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:02,552
Because if there were...

409
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,722
...a class-one senior agent
such as myself...

410
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,433
...would have been aware of it,
wouldn't he have?

411
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:11,144
Were it not classified
and way above his pay grade.

412
00:30:12,353 --> 00:30:13,521
You know, I need a raise.

413
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,274
There was one man, scumbag,
Obadiah Price.

414
00:30:16,441 --> 00:30:19,485
He figured it out, we busted him,
we made time travel illegal...

415
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:23,197
...throughout the universe
and he is serving life on Lunar-Max.

416
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,117
No... That's where Boris
was locked up.

417
00:30:28,578 --> 00:30:30,371
If Boris worked out
how to time jump...

418
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:33,249
...he could seriously change
the course of history.

419
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,627
<i>Attention.</i>
<i>Early warning system engaged.</i>

420
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,756
<i>Inbound hostile warships</i>
<i>entering solar system.</i>

421
00:30:39,922 --> 00:30:41,966
<i>Boglodite markings</i>
<i>and language detected.</i>

422
00:30:42,133 --> 00:30:45,595
Boglodite. Boris is a Boglodite,
but they're extinct.

423
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,055
Apparently not.

424
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,183
<i>Catastrophic Earth attack imminent.</i>

425
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:52,060
Put up the Arc Net.

426
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:54,937
- The what?
- The Arc Net. The defense system.

427
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:56,773
K got it for the Boglodites.

428
00:30:58,024 --> 00:30:59,525
There is no K.

429
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:01,986
He's been dead for over 40 years.

430
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:05,782
No K. No defense system.

431
00:31:06,157 --> 00:31:07,700
Boris jumped back and killed him.

432
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:10,787
If you wanna save the world,
stop that from happening.

433
00:31:11,204 --> 00:31:13,623
You have to find Jeffrey Price.
He's Obadiah's son.

434
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:16,292
Let's hope the little squirt
hasn't skipped town.

435
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:22,423
- Good luck, J!
- This planet's toast.

436
00:31:39,273 --> 00:31:41,651
How can I help you?
We're having an amazing sale...

437
00:31:41,818 --> 00:31:42,485
...on batteries.

438
00:31:42,652 --> 00:31:45,279
Okay, we got other stuff,
like headphones, adapters or...

439
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,407
You helped Boris the Animal
time jump.

440
00:31:47,657 --> 00:31:49,659
Okay, I had to. That dude's a freak.

441
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:50,827
He killed my partner.

442
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:53,371
I want to know when
and where you sent him.

443
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:55,873
What, you think I keep,
like, a logbook?

444
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,464
Target vector, July 16...

445
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,550
- ...1969.
- All right.

446
00:32:05,716 --> 00:32:07,468
That's a real bummer
about your buddy.

447
00:32:07,635 --> 00:32:09,095
I'm sure he was a great guy.

448
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:11,305
But in terms of
the space-time continuum...

449
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:14,100
...your friend was a little blip
on the historical radar!

450
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,940
That's a big blip.

451
00:32:21,858 --> 00:32:24,152
- Okay. What's the plan?
- You're gonna send me...

452
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:26,237
...back to July 15th, 1969.

453
00:32:26,404 --> 00:32:29,198
No, that's a stupid plan,
because I sent Boris to July 16th.

454
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:32,243
I'm not worried about that one.
I'll kill the younger Boris...

455
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,870
...before the older one shows.

456
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:36,497
That way, neither of them
will even exist.

457
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:39,500
That's why you get to wear
the black suit.

458
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:40,918
No?

459
00:32:41,085 --> 00:32:43,212
You're gonna leave me hanging?
Okay.

460
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:45,882
Oh, I just thought of something.
Even back then...

461
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:48,134
...New York was like a big-ish city.

462
00:32:48,301 --> 00:32:50,219
So how are you
gonna really find him?

463
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:54,849
On July 15th, Boris killed an alien,
Roman the Fabulist, at Coney Island.

464
00:32:55,016 --> 00:32:57,185
You're gonna get there first
and be waiting?

465
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:59,479
Dude, they should give you
two black suits.

466
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,897
My man, for real?

467
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:01,939
Oh, right.

468
00:33:02,106 --> 00:33:03,357
Sorry.

469
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,526
This...

470
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:08,112
...is the real deal. Time-jump gear.

471
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:09,989
Very rare, very old.

472
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:12,325
But first, we gotta get high.

473
00:33:12,575 --> 00:33:13,868
Hey. No.

474
00:33:14,243 --> 00:33:16,704
No. No, I mean, really high.

475
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:41,604
Hey, man? A little help here?

476
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:45,650
Thank you.

477
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:46,692
Okay.

478
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,863
- You know the rules of time jumps?
- Give me the short version.

479
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,824
Okay. You wanna save your partner,
word of advice:

480
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,535
Stay away from him.

481
00:33:55,701 --> 00:33:58,204
Yeah, got it. Stay away from K.
Just kill Boris.

482
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,206
Now, take these.

483
00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,124
It gets pretty windy
on the way down.

484
00:34:03,376 --> 00:34:04,502
The way down?

485
00:34:04,669 --> 00:34:07,004
With eyes tearing up,
it's hard to read the dial.

486
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,591
Plus, it helps you look like a real
time traveler, which is cool.

487
00:34:10,758 --> 00:34:12,843
I am not jumping off of this building!

488
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,887
Time jump.

489
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:16,931
Okay, now...

490
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,891
...I gotta set this thing...

491
00:34:19,058 --> 00:34:20,643
...to the 15th.

492
00:34:22,186 --> 00:34:22,853
That seems...

493
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,022
...right-ish.

494
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,066
Now...

495
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:29,694
...all you gotta do is jump.

496
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,280
Hey, hey, Stop. Stop it.

497
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:34,156
When you're moving fast enough...

498
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,868
...that circle is gonna fill up with
some sort of green time-travel liquid...

499
00:34:38,035 --> 00:34:39,787
...and it's gonna glow really bright.

500
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:42,582
As soon as that happens,
break that blue laser line...

501
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,709
...with your thumb
to complete the circuit.

502
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:46,919
At this height, that should be...

503
00:34:47,086 --> 00:34:50,006
Let's see, mass of Earth
and 30-something feet per minute...

504
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,633
It's 32 feet per second. Per second.

505
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,760
That sounds right-ish.

506
00:34:54,927 --> 00:34:59,265
So that would be, I guess,
about two feet off the ground.

507
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,725
I break the laser line?

508
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:01,892
No, don't break it!

509
00:35:02,059 --> 00:35:04,020
- No, when I'm fast enough!
- Sounds good!

510
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:07,106
Do I break the laser line
or do I not break the laser line?

511
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:09,275
Do not lose that time device...

512
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:13,404
...or you will be stuck in 1969!

513
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:16,407
It wasn't the best time
for your people.

514
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:20,620
I'm just saying.
It's, like, a lot cooler now.

515
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:22,330
How will I know if it works?

516
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,332
You'll either know...

517
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,834
...or you won't.

518
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:35,217
You must really love this guy
to do this.

519
00:35:35,384 --> 00:35:38,429
Oh, wait. How come I remember K,
but nobody else does?

520
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:44,185
- That means you were there!
- I was where?

521
00:35:44,393 --> 00:35:47,313
If you survive, you gotta come back
and tell me everything.

522
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,147
Where was I?

523
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:50,816
You gotta go!

524
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:51,776
Just go, go, go!

525
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,094
Oh, no!

526
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:35,820
Come on!

527
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:13,751
- My man, what's today?
- Tuesday.

528
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,419
- The date?
- The 15th.

529
00:38:15,586 --> 00:38:17,171
- Of?
“July

530
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,465
- Dog, the year.
- 1969.

531
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,258
Thank you.

532
00:38:21,634 --> 00:38:23,886
Look at me like I'm crazy.

533
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:35,356
Far out.

534
00:38:35,523 --> 00:38:37,983
Jerry rocked Haight-Ashbury
like you wouldn't believe.

535
00:38:46,826 --> 00:38:48,285
Okay, we're here.

536
00:38:48,452 --> 00:38:49,995
- Happy?
- You're such a pill, Fred.

537
00:38:53,249 --> 00:38:55,668
- Get us checked in.
- Yeah, yeah.

538
00:38:56,919 --> 00:38:58,546
Hey. Hey, do me a favour, all right?

539
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,923
- Be careful with the luggage.
- Absolutely, sir.

540
00:39:01,924 --> 00:39:04,260
I paid a lot of money
for that luggage.

541
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:06,971
- We'll take good care-
- Last time, it got scuffed up.

542
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:10,599
Here you go, sir.
Just call down when you need it.

543
00:39:11,934 --> 00:39:13,227
There's more in the trunk.

544
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:16,522
Yeah, it'll be in your room, sir.
Just go in.

545
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:19,608
Excuse me. Excuse me, who is that?
Who are you?

546
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:27,908
Let's go!

547
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:46,969
Far out, man!

548
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,889
If you want to keep that, I wouldn't.

549
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,640
Make love, not war.

550
00:39:53,142 --> 00:39:55,185
I prefer to do both.

551
00:40:30,888 --> 00:40:32,932
How are you, officers?
What can I do you for?

552
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,185
Well, look at this.
Power windows, power seats.

553
00:40:36,685 --> 00:40:38,479
- I'll bet you it cost 6 grand.
- Yeah.

554
00:40:38,646 --> 00:40:41,982
Yes, and it has a roof,
but it's hidden.

555
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:44,026
Hey, what kind of work do you do?

556
00:40:44,276 --> 00:40:45,486
An individual of your...

557
00:40:45,653 --> 00:40:48,572
...particular ethnic persuasion?

558
00:40:50,115 --> 00:40:52,493
Maybe he's a noted athlete.

559
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:58,082
Yes. Starting forward
for the Detroit Darkies.

560
00:40:58,457 --> 00:41:00,501
- Where'd you get the car?
- And the suit?

561
00:41:00,709 --> 00:41:03,379
I stole them both.
Car from your wife...

562
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:05,381
...suit from your grandmother.

563
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:07,883
Hey.

564
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,885
What do we have here?
Concealed weapon?

565
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,762
Hey, it's his grandmother's suit.

566
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:13,931
- Hey, what's this?
- Probably drugs.

567
00:41:14,098 --> 00:41:16,392
I have rights
and I demand to see my lawyer...

568
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:19,478
...before you press that small button
on the side firmly.

569
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:20,312
Press it.

570
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:28,654
That, gentlemen,
is a standard-issue neuralyser.

571
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:30,280
You're not gonna remember that.

572
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:33,200
And just because you see
a black man driving a nice car...

573
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:35,661
...does not mean it's stolen.

574
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:42,209
I stole that one.
But not because I'm black.

575
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,922
I'll be done
with the car in a minute!

576
00:41:47,089 --> 00:41:50,676
Just find it and take it back
to the jerk at the Roosevelt Hotel.

577
00:42:05,524 --> 00:42:07,484
Where is the Archanan?

578
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:08,736
You are too late.

579
00:42:08,944 --> 00:42:11,572
He is going to give the humans...

580
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:12,406
...the Arc Net.

581
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:16,535
Let's agree to disagree.

582
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:48,650
We'll take it from here.

583
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,444
K?

584
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:54,114
K! K!

585
00:43:10,255 --> 00:43:12,049
Dad, I'm on Earth.

586
00:43:12,216 --> 00:43:13,842
I need bail.

587
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:26,396
<i>Will the owner of a blue</i>
<i>warp-speed cruiser...</i>

588
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,982
<i>please report to the front desk.</i>

589
00:43:31,944 --> 00:43:36,490
You need to turn the electricity
down on that damn thing.

590
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:38,826
Can't taste my fricking tongue, K.

591
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,119
How do you know my name?

592
00:43:42,121 --> 00:43:44,456
What? Because I called you "K"?

593
00:43:45,124 --> 00:43:46,750
No, I call everybody K.

594
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:48,669
It's kind of my thing.

595
00:43:48,836 --> 00:43:50,003
What up, K?

596
00:43:50,254 --> 00:43:51,463
All right, I sort of...

597
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:56,885
Yeah, that's kind of my thing.
I just... Some people like it.

598
00:43:57,052 --> 00:43:59,179
Most people.

599
00:43:59,388 --> 00:44:00,973
Now that I know what you look like...

600
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,766
...when you're lying, show me...

601
00:44:02,933 --> 00:44:05,310
...what you look like
when you're telling the truth?

602
00:44:06,061 --> 00:44:08,689
I won those at Coney Island
on the ring toss.

603
00:44:08,897 --> 00:44:11,275
I won a stuffed bear once,
but never one of these.

604
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:13,318
Must be good, slick.

605
00:44:13,652 --> 00:44:16,196
All right, sir,
I was minding my own business.

606
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,532
I was waiting for my girl,
who, by the way...

607
00:44:18,699 --> 00:44:21,326
...is probably worried sick
looking for me right now.

608
00:44:21,493 --> 00:44:24,496
So I just need my things
and I need to get back to her.

609
00:44:24,663 --> 00:44:25,581
What's her name?

610
00:44:27,124 --> 00:44:28,417
Your gal, what's her name?

611
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:31,336
Schtaron.

612
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,215
Schtaron?

613
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:41,930
I bet Schtaron
likes that suit of yours.

614
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,766
What, it's a crime
to wear a black suit?

615
00:44:45,017 --> 00:44:47,811
All right, listen.
I haven't done anything wrong.

616
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:50,439
And I need to get out of here.
I cannot be with you.

617
00:44:50,606 --> 00:44:54,776
Terribly sorry. X is frightfully upset
about the whole Coney Island incident.

618
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,445
Thanks for the heads-up.

619
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:00,824
Oh, man, this coffee tastes like dirt.

620
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:03,744
- What do you expect? It was...
- Just ground this morning.

621
00:45:04,703 --> 00:45:05,495
K?

622
00:45:09,708 --> 00:45:11,668
No, I call ladies

623
00:45:11,835 --> 00:45:14,880
To me, O is feminine,
K is masculine.

624
00:45:15,047 --> 00:45:19,551
You know, I see a couple,
I'm like, "O-K."

625
00:45:19,718 --> 00:45:22,095
What a mess. Any casualties?

626
00:45:22,304 --> 00:45:24,181
Yes, Roman the Fabulist.

627
00:45:24,348 --> 00:45:26,600
Any human casualties?

628
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:28,894
No, sir.

629
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,188
Who the hell is this?

630
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:32,773
Look, I was...

631
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,943
- Stray human caught in the net.
- Code 43 him and throw him back.

632
00:45:36,109 --> 00:45:38,195
You're late for a meeting
with the Viagrans.

633
00:45:38,362 --> 00:45:40,489
They have a revolutionary new pill.

634
00:45:40,656 --> 00:45:41,823
It's really...

635
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:44,701
Okay, slick.

636
00:45:47,412 --> 00:45:48,664
I was waiting for my girl.

637
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,873
Schtaron.

638
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,709
Yes, she's Greek.

639
00:45:53,919 --> 00:45:58,215
Okay. Just one last thing.
An eye exam.

640
00:46:03,595 --> 00:46:06,431
That's not an eye exam, K.
That's a big-ass neuralyser!

641
00:46:06,598 --> 00:46:09,768
You have a lot of information for
a fella who doesn't know anything.

642
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:11,311
I see what you're saying.

643
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:13,855
You know, K,
we need to hold up a second.

644
00:46:14,022 --> 00:46:15,232
K!

645
00:46:16,108 --> 00:46:17,776
Let's get this bite guard in here.

646
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:19,695
Hey, back up, back up.

647
00:46:20,779 --> 00:46:23,615
K, listen, I think we got off
on the wrong foot, all right?

648
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:26,118
So let's just stop for a second
and talk.

649
00:46:26,285 --> 00:46:27,995
Don't put me in here, K!

650
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:29,329
Too late, hoss.

651
00:46:29,496 --> 00:46:32,499
K, no, listen to me.
I can help you with this case!

652
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:34,793
K!

653
00:46:36,128 --> 00:46:38,338
I'm doing the truth face!
You're missing it!

654
00:46:38,755 --> 00:46:40,340
I'll just use my imagination.

655
00:46:43,802 --> 00:46:44,761
K, the killer...

656
00:46:44,928 --> 00:46:47,639
...you're looking for, I'm after
the same guy. A Boglodite.

657
00:46:47,806 --> 00:46:48,849
His name is Boris.

658
00:46:49,016 --> 00:46:50,142
Ship has sailed, amigo.

659
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:52,060
If we don't get him, there'll be two.

660
00:46:52,311 --> 00:46:54,146
You had my undivided attention.

661
00:46:54,313 --> 00:46:55,439
One will have one arm...

662
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,316
...and one's gonna have two. K!

663
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:58,817
Listen to me!

664
00:46:58,984 --> 00:46:59,943
If you erase me...

665
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,361
...you erase the world!

666
00:47:03,322 --> 00:47:04,239
<i>Fifteen seconds...</i>

667
00:47:04,406 --> 00:47:06,616
<i>...to neuralysation. Fourteen.</i>

668
00:47:07,409 --> 00:47:09,453
<i>Thirteen. Twelve.</i>

669
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:12,539
<i>Eleven. Ten. Nine.</i>

670
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:17,627
When you see Boris tomorrow, K,
kill him. Do not arrest him, kill him!

671
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:20,839
<i>Four. Three. Two.</i>

672
00:47:27,512 --> 00:47:31,266
Is this thing off?
Hey, I don't think it's all the way off, K!

673
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,769
It's whirring and buzzing.

674
00:47:34,603 --> 00:47:36,897
I don't know if I don't know nothing.

675
00:47:40,859 --> 00:47:42,277
I knew Roman.

676
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:45,322
His wife cooked me dinner once.
While it was not pleasant...

677
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:46,990
...he was my friend.

678
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,160
Last chance, who are you
and what do you know?

679
00:47:55,374 --> 00:47:56,333
I'm an agent...

680
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,126
...from the future. We're partners.

681
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,961
In 25 years, you'll recruit me...

682
00:48:00,128 --> 00:48:03,215
...and 14 years after that,
the guy you didn't let me kill today...

683
00:48:03,382 --> 00:48:05,384
...escapes from prison,
jumps to the past...

684
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:09,221
...and unleashes an invasion of Earth.
We got about 19 hours to kill him...

685
00:48:09,388 --> 00:48:12,057
...so, really, we need to go right now.

686
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:20,774
All right.

687
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:28,240
So that's the story you believe.

688
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:29,449
That one was the truth.

689
00:48:29,616 --> 00:48:31,701
Wasn't the whole truth,
but it'll do for now.

690
00:48:31,868 --> 00:48:34,996
What are you talking about?
Of course it's the whole truth.

691
00:48:35,163 --> 00:48:38,375
The problem with a lie is once
you start lying you put yourself...

692
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:43,922
Agent K.

693
00:48:44,506 --> 00:48:45,799
What's he still doing here?

694
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:48,802
I might have cooked him too long.
Thought I'd walk him out.

695
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,804
I put my pants on.

696
00:48:56,518 --> 00:48:58,019
Okay, future man, where to?

697
00:48:59,521 --> 00:49:00,605
I don't know.

698
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:01,773
What do you mean?

699
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:07,821
I don't know.
Go wherever you went last time.

700
00:49:07,988 --> 00:49:10,407
I haven't been here.
I didn't tell you where I went?

701
00:49:10,615 --> 00:49:13,994
No. I mean, we don't really talk.

702
00:49:14,911 --> 00:49:18,331
What kind of partners sit in a car
every day for 14 years and don't talk?

703
00:49:18,957 --> 00:49:23,086
Exactly. And this is the type
of problem it causes.

704
00:49:23,253 --> 00:49:24,296
It's dysfunctional.

705
00:49:24,546 --> 00:49:28,633
All right, sport, you better get useful
real quick or you go back in room 43.

706
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,344
Man...

707
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:37,642
There was something in the file
about a factory.

708
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,978
Something happened at a factory.

709
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,817
Hey, look, man, you can put
your Jedi Knight on me all you want.

710
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:47,235
That's all I got.

711
00:49:52,574 --> 00:49:53,658
That spark something?

712
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:56,536
Roman had this on his person
when he was murdered.

713
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,706
It's a matchbook.

714
00:49:59,915 --> 00:50:01,750
No, it's a clue.

715
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,585
He didn't smoke.

716
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,158
You lose something over here,
Hondo?

717
00:50:35,534 --> 00:50:36,910
No.

718
00:50:37,077 --> 00:50:39,371
Hey, man, how old are you?

719
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:43,083
Twenty-nine.

720
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,502
You got some city miles on you.

721
00:50:46,294 --> 00:50:49,297
I'm starting to understand
why we don't talk.

722
00:50:56,179 --> 00:50:58,890
- How well do you know this place?
- I know its reputation.

723
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:03,019
I don't like it. I hate going in blind.
I'm gonna need my gun.

724
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:05,438
Sure thing, slick.

725
00:51:05,605 --> 00:51:08,024
K! Wait, no, I gotta go in
with you!

726
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:09,985
You sit tight. I'll be fine.

727
00:51:10,151 --> 00:51:12,320
Wait, no! No!

728
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:13,280
K!

729
00:51:13,446 --> 00:51:16,157
K, don't go in by yourself!

730
00:51:18,827 --> 00:51:19,703
Hi, fellas.

731
00:51:21,997 --> 00:51:23,373
Need to see the boss.

732
00:51:23,707 --> 00:51:24,874
He's busy.

733
00:51:26,042 --> 00:51:28,086
Well, I'm gonna just
take a look around.

734
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:36,219
Looks like we have ourselves
a standoff.

735
00:51:36,386 --> 00:51:38,346
Looks that way.

736
00:51:42,309 --> 00:51:45,478
- Still keep the key under the ashtray.
- Lucky guess.

737
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:47,188
Now, where were we?

738
00:51:47,355 --> 00:51:49,232
I was about to tell you to screw off.

739
00:51:49,399 --> 00:51:51,276
Hey, slick, you bowl in the future?

740
00:51:51,443 --> 00:51:53,612
MiB league champ,
three years running.

741
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:55,447
Well, let's see it.

742
00:51:56,406 --> 00:51:57,657
You did not walk into my...

743
00:51:57,824 --> 00:51:59,618
...establishment
and rip my head off!

744
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:03,288
My man, we don't have a lot of time.
You really need to tell him something.

745
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,123
I'll tell him this!

746
00:52:05,290 --> 00:52:06,291
All right, your head.

747
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:10,462
Wait. Hey, if you do this,
I am gonna hunt you down...

748
00:52:10,629 --> 00:52:11,796
...and make sure you...

749
00:52:11,963 --> 00:52:13,465
...walk funny for the rest...

750
00:52:13,632 --> 00:52:15,717
...of your miserable last days
on Earth!

751
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,802
Tough spare, slick.

752
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,220
You messed with the wrong head!

753
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:21,556
- His head's a little...
- You gonna tell us...

754
00:52:21,723 --> 00:52:23,224
...where Dom is?

755
00:52:23,391 --> 00:52:25,685
I'll kill you both.
I'll kill both of youse!

756
00:52:28,021 --> 00:52:30,273
Your hook's a little off.
Want me to clean her?

757
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,067
- Sure thing.
- No, no, no.

758
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:35,987
Come on, I just cleaned
the bathroom with this thing!

759
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:37,447
No cleaning! No cleaning!

760
00:52:37,614 --> 00:52:41,618
Okay! Okay, all right!
All right, he's in the back.

761
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:44,371
But he's not gonna talk
to Men in Black scum like you.

762
00:52:44,537 --> 00:52:46,206
Now give me back my head.

763
00:52:46,790 --> 00:52:49,751
K, I call this one
"Low Hanging Fruit."

764
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,211
That ain't a finger hole...

765
00:52:51,378 --> 00:52:53,088
...you sick bastard!

766
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:54,422
I'll pop your head off...

767
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:55,965
...and see how you like it.

768
00:52:58,593 --> 00:52:59,844
I'm gonna kill both of you!

769
00:53:00,261 --> 00:53:02,305
I'm gonna kill the both of youse!

770
00:53:02,472 --> 00:53:03,973
I'll kill you both!

771
00:53:07,477 --> 00:53:10,438
- Well, we're on the right track.
- Just the wrong train.

772
00:53:10,814 --> 00:53:12,148
If he had any secrets...

773
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:13,817
...I'm guessing he spilled them.

774
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:16,361
A smart man figures out
what victims have in common.

775
00:53:16,528 --> 00:53:18,029
A smart man would.

776
00:53:18,196 --> 00:53:19,614
That's a big-ass phone.

777
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:22,867
- Don't put that up to your head.
- Agent O.

778
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,453
How's your day been, Agent K?

779
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,746
Fair to middling.

780
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:27,914
How are things going?

781
00:53:28,081 --> 00:53:29,290
<i>Very good, thank you.</i>

782
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:31,209
Hey, you saw her like an hour ago.

783
00:53:31,376 --> 00:53:33,586
I need cleanup and containment
at Cosmic Lanes.

784
00:53:33,753 --> 00:53:35,672
Listen, I got a dead Parlaxian.

785
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,550
Now Roman was a Byvoid,
correct me if I'm wrong...

786
00:53:38,717 --> 00:53:42,345
- ...from the same planetary grouping?
<i>- A system in the Triangulum Galaxy...</i>

787
00:53:42,512 --> 00:53:43,763
...wiped out by Boglodites.

788
00:53:43,930 --> 00:53:45,140
Wasn't the third planet...?

789
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:47,058
- Glamouria?
- Glamouria.

790
00:53:48,727 --> 00:53:49,811
Thank you, Miss O.

791
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:53,398
I know where Boris
is headed to next.

792
00:53:53,565 --> 00:53:58,153
You were close, slick.
It's not a factory, it's the Factory.

793
00:54:02,031 --> 00:54:05,076
Look, if Boris turns out
to be here, I'm gonna kill him...

794
00:54:05,243 --> 00:54:07,787
- ...I need my gun.
- No deal.

795
00:54:09,706 --> 00:54:11,207
I've been an agent for 14 years.

796
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:14,919
Which means I'm the senior agent
on this case. Now, I hate to pull rank...

797
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:17,130
...but I am instructing
my junior agent...

798
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:20,216
...that's you, to give me my gun
right now. That's an order.

799
00:54:27,182 --> 00:54:28,641
No, no, no, space gun.

800
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,226
You're welcome.

801
00:54:31,186 --> 00:54:32,687
I didn't say thank you.

802
00:54:38,777 --> 00:54:41,279
For such an ungainly species,
they've thrived on Earth.

803
00:54:41,446 --> 00:54:43,031
I was an agent for three years...

804
00:54:43,198 --> 00:54:45,241
...before I realised
all models were aliens.

805
00:54:45,408 --> 00:54:47,577
Found out the hard way.

806
00:54:47,952 --> 00:54:48,703
Password?

807
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:51,539
Hey, look, funky '60s dude,
we don't have a lot of time.

808
00:54:51,706 --> 00:54:52,999
Janis Joplin.

809
00:55:01,299 --> 00:55:03,718
Is there anybody here
who's not an alien?

810
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:10,141
Very nice.

811
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:11,935
Blink. That's good.

812
00:55:12,143 --> 00:55:13,061
Look in the camera.

813
00:55:13,394 --> 00:55:15,271
Is that Andy Warhol?

814
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:18,358
Yep.

815
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:23,613
Excuse me, Mr. Warhol,
could we have a minute?

816
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,991
Now is not a good time.
This is a be-in.

817
00:55:27,492 --> 00:55:28,326
Just a few...

818
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:29,744
...questions.

819
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:33,081
No questions. No answers.

820
00:55:33,248 --> 00:55:34,874
Just being.

821
00:55:35,250 --> 00:55:37,460
We have an urgent matter
to discuss with you...

822
00:55:37,627 --> 00:55:39,462
...regarding one
of your party guests.

823
00:55:40,839 --> 00:55:42,298
Why don't you come back...

824
00:55:42,465 --> 00:55:44,467
...next week, after the happening...

825
00:55:44,634 --> 00:55:46,427
...has happened.

826
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:50,431
Sorry, Mr. Warhol. You like
talking slow. We got stuff to do.

827
00:55:50,598 --> 00:55:51,808
I've got a planet to save.

828
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:54,394
You're distressing. Everything...

829
00:55:54,561 --> 00:55:56,145
...about you upsets me.

830
00:55:59,983 --> 00:56:02,026
Damn it, K!
Are you trying to blow my cover?

831
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:03,903
Agent W, your cover is safe.

832
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,905
Whoa, Andy Warhol is one of us?

833
00:56:06,072 --> 00:56:06,906
Safe?

834
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,075
You out of your mind?
I'm so out of ideas...

835
00:56:09,242 --> 00:56:11,452
...I'm painting cans
and bananas for chrissakes.

836
00:56:11,703 --> 00:56:14,372
Actually, Mr. Warhol,
I gotta tell you, I love your work.

837
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:15,874
Oh, thank you.

838
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:16,958
Who's the dumb-ass?

839
00:56:18,126 --> 00:56:20,295
How about a little
professional courtesy here?

840
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:21,754
- Dumb-ass.
- Say it again.

841
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:23,089
- Want me to?
- I dare you.

842
00:56:23,256 --> 00:56:24,048
Dumb-ass.

843
00:56:24,215 --> 00:56:25,884
- Agents.
- I have no problem...

844
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,386
...pimp-slapping the shiznit
out of Andy Warhol.

845
00:56:29,053 --> 00:56:29,721
What?

846
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,561
Why are you looking at me?

847
00:56:39,314 --> 00:56:41,649
Oh, all right. You know what?
Agent K...

848
00:56:41,816 --> 00:56:44,485
...you see what information
you can get from Agent W...

849
00:56:44,652 --> 00:56:46,863
...and I'll go case the perimeter.

850
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:48,740
- That work for everybody?
- Go do that.

851
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:50,366
- How about that?
- Oh, cute.

852
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:52,410
- Okay.
- Very nice.

853
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:54,996
Someone forget his nap?

854
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,672
Hey, how you doing?

855
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,300
Chilling.

856
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:13,264
Who's that guy?

857
00:57:13,514 --> 00:57:15,183
Don't tell me he's your new partner.

858
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,937
Actually, he's my old partner.
He travelled back from the future...

859
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:21,230
Stop, don't tell me.
I don't want to know.

860
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:23,191
Andy, Yoko's here.

861
00:57:23,358 --> 00:57:25,234
Yoko's here.

862
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:30,657
Tell her that I'm filming this man
eating a hamburger.

863
00:57:31,199 --> 00:57:33,409
It's transcendent.

864
00:57:33,743 --> 00:57:35,995
All right, now the pickle.

865
00:57:43,336 --> 00:57:44,754
What are you doing on my turf?

866
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:46,506
Tracking a killer. Boglodite.

867
00:57:46,673 --> 00:57:49,217
We believe he's gonna
hit here next, a Glamourian.

868
00:57:49,384 --> 00:57:52,428
Glamourian?
Right solar system, wrong planet.

869
00:57:52,595 --> 00:57:54,138
He's gotta be after the Archanan.

870
00:57:54,305 --> 00:57:55,556
Archanans are extinct.

871
00:57:55,723 --> 00:57:58,643
Apparently not.
One washed ashore last week.

872
00:57:58,893 --> 00:58:01,980
The whole Roswell circuit's
all abuzz about it.

873
00:58:02,313 --> 00:58:04,565
Alien unicorn. Last of its species.

874
00:58:05,233 --> 00:58:06,275
His name's Griffin.

875
00:58:06,734 --> 00:58:08,820
<i>Griffin the Archanan.</i>

876
00:58:10,571 --> 00:58:11,614
How's it going?

877
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:15,243
Going? How's it going? That depends.
For me, personally, things are good.

878
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:16,911
Unless we're in the future...

879
00:58:17,078 --> 00:58:19,414
...where the muscle boy argues
with his girlfriend.

880
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,458
She storms off and bumps the guy
with the stuffed mushrooms...

881
00:58:22,625 --> 00:58:24,711
...who dumps the tray
on the sailors on leave.

882
00:58:24,877 --> 00:58:26,129
A shoving match breaks out.

883
00:58:26,295 --> 00:58:29,132
They crash into the table.
In which case, I gotta move my plate.

884
00:58:33,344 --> 00:58:36,139
Or it's the future where
the pastrami sandwich I'm eating...

885
00:58:36,305 --> 00:58:38,016
...causes me gastric distress.

886
00:58:38,182 --> 00:58:40,810
Thankfully, your friend offers
the antacids he carries...

887
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:43,813
...in his right pocket, so good.
I'll be good.

888
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:46,941
Except in the future where
I have to leave in two minutes...

889
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:49,527
...before he has a chance
to offer me the antacids...

890
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:52,697
...so on the whole, I'd have to say
not good. I am not good.

891
00:58:54,866 --> 00:58:56,534
But that depends.

892
00:58:58,619 --> 00:58:59,912
K!

893
00:59:00,413 --> 00:59:01,622
How will we find this guy?

894
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:03,541
What am I, a schmuck?

895
00:59:04,042 --> 00:59:04,709
He's here?

896
00:59:04,876 --> 00:59:07,920
"Here" is a relative term.
He's a fifth dimensional being.

897
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:10,381
They can live in and visualize
an infinite set...

898
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,759
...of time-space probabilities
simultaneously.

899
00:59:13,301 --> 00:59:14,844
Sounds like fun. Good work.

900
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:16,471
Whoa, whoa, K, K, K.

901
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,266
You gotta fake my death, okay?

902
00:59:20,433 --> 00:59:22,518
I can't listen to sitar music anymore.

903
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:25,396
All right, I'll see what I can do.
I'll talk to X.

904
00:59:25,563 --> 00:59:27,690
K, I can't tell
the women from the men.

905
00:59:27,857 --> 00:59:29,067
May I see your watch?

906
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:30,985
Oh, it is 7:18.

907
00:59:31,360 --> 00:59:33,863
No, no, your other watch,
the one your father gave you.

908
00:59:35,740 --> 00:59:37,825
How do you know
about my father's watch?

909
00:59:41,496 --> 00:59:42,747
Oh, dear.

910
00:59:43,164 --> 00:59:44,874
This is the one
where Roman is dead...

911
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:47,668
...and the gentleman at the
bowling alley. So much death.

912
00:59:47,835 --> 00:59:51,297
Such an infinitesimally
small chance for success.

913
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:53,174
K!

914
00:59:53,382 --> 00:59:54,050
Griffin, right?

915
00:59:55,051 --> 00:59:55,718
We're here...

916
00:59:55,885 --> 00:59:57,011
Because of Boris.

917
00:59:57,220 --> 00:59:58,387
We think he's coming...

918
00:59:58,554 --> 01:00:00,139
To kill me.
He'll be here in minutes...

919
01:00:00,348 --> 01:00:01,349
...unless we're in...

920
01:00:01,516 --> 01:00:02,975
...the future
where he made the lights...

921
01:00:03,142 --> 01:00:04,143
...and is about...

922
01:00:04,310 --> 01:00:05,520
...to shoot from the door...

923
01:00:05,686 --> 01:00:07,021
...in which case we're all dead.

924
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:11,567
Good, that was a close one.

925
01:00:11,734 --> 01:00:13,152
K, I need a space gun.

926
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:14,403
The Boglodites...

927
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:15,988
...consume any planet
in their path.

928
01:00:16,155 --> 01:00:17,448
Mine, Roman's, the Parlaxians'.

929
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:21,452
I tried to stop them, but if we stop
them here, if we deny them Earth...

930
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:23,746
...we can stop them.
They'll starve before...

931
01:00:23,913 --> 01:00:24,997
...they reach the next planet.

932
01:00:27,875 --> 01:00:29,085
Sixty-three seconds.

933
01:00:29,502 --> 01:00:30,837
How do we do that? Stop them?

934
01:00:31,546 --> 01:00:33,214
What?

935
01:00:33,714 --> 01:00:35,675
Sorry. I have something for you.

936
01:00:35,842 --> 01:00:38,010
A gift. It can protect you.

937
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,223
I had to hide it from Boris,
but if you find me again...

938
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:44,684
...I'll give it to you.

939
01:00:44,892 --> 01:00:48,521
Thank you. What a game!
Amazing! It's a real miracle!

940
01:00:48,813 --> 01:00:50,356
What do you mean? What miracle?

941
01:00:50,523 --> 01:00:52,108
Thirty seconds. I have to go.

942
01:00:52,275 --> 01:00:53,234
No, we got you.

943
01:00:53,401 --> 01:00:55,820
Negative possibilities are
multiplying as we speak.

944
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:57,280
- Okay.
- Twenty seconds.

945
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:58,114
All right.

946
01:00:58,281 --> 01:00:59,240
We got it, relax.

947
01:00:59,407 --> 01:01:01,576
If your watch is broken
and I have gastric...

948
01:01:01,742 --> 01:01:04,495
Fly! Find your place in the world!

949
01:01:04,662 --> 01:01:06,330
Oh, dear.

950
01:01:06,539 --> 01:01:08,457
Boris is coming through that door...

951
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:09,333
...in 12...

952
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,127
...11,10...

953
01:01:11,335 --> 01:01:12,086
Wait!

954
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:13,838
Did you have chocolate milk?

955
01:01:15,089 --> 01:01:15,756
Yes.

956
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:17,884
Cindy.

957
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:20,219
K!

958
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:21,220
- Griffin!
- Got him.

959
01:01:30,438 --> 01:01:31,564
Damn it!

960
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:52,418
I'm good, I'm good.

961
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:53,794
What you got?

962
01:01:54,712 --> 01:01:56,964
Damn it! We had him!

963
01:01:57,215 --> 01:01:59,091
Relax, Cochise. We'll find him.

964
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:01,552
First of all, my name is J, okay?

965
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:04,639
It's not "son," it's not "slick"
and it damn sure ain't no "Cochise."

966
01:02:04,972 --> 01:02:07,725
I'm not gonna relax because
we're running out of time...

967
01:02:07,892 --> 01:02:09,477
...and there's an invasion coming.

968
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:12,605
You're not really recognizing
my voicial intensity.

969
01:02:14,232 --> 01:02:16,234
But there was one guy
who could help.

970
01:02:16,484 --> 01:02:18,444
Hey, Griffin! Griffin! Where's Griffin?

971
01:02:19,487 --> 01:02:21,280
Griffin. Where's Griffin at, K?

972
01:02:21,572 --> 01:02:25,493
He's gone. If Boris gets to him
before we do, that's no bueno.

973
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:27,119
We need pie.

974
01:02:27,453 --> 01:02:29,830
- What?
- My granddaddy always said:

975
01:02:29,997 --> 01:02:32,208
"if you got a problem
you can't solve...

976
01:02:32,375 --> 01:02:34,543
...it helps to get out
of your head." Pie.

977
01:02:35,336 --> 01:02:36,087
- Pie?
- Yeah.

978
01:02:36,254 --> 01:02:37,880
Your granddaddy, heavyset man?

979
01:02:38,339 --> 01:02:40,633
- A little bit.
- Yeah, you know what?

980
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,343
We've been doing smart stuff:

981
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,679
We've been following clues,
doing police work.

982
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,973
It might be time
we do something stupid.

983
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:50,101
Something that ain't got
nothing to do with nothing.

984
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:52,186
Now, I want some pie, K.
I want some pie.

985
01:02:52,353 --> 01:02:53,729
Let's go get dumb-ass pie.

986
01:02:54,355 --> 01:02:55,815
Sounds good.

987
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:26,804
Have any specials?

988
01:03:27,555 --> 01:03:30,850
He'll have what he always has after
he reads the menu for 10 minutes...

989
01:03:31,017 --> 01:03:32,435
...and asks about specials.

990
01:03:32,601 --> 01:03:35,271
A slice of apple pie
with a nasty piece of cheddar.

991
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:36,981
I'll have the strawberry-rhubarb.

992
01:03:37,148 --> 01:03:38,899
It's my last meal,
I'm gonna splurge.

993
01:03:42,403 --> 01:03:45,823
World-class serial killer out there
and we're having pie.

994
01:03:46,032 --> 01:03:48,492
What do you do in your spare time,
stretch?

995
01:03:49,577 --> 01:03:53,372
See, I sense you're not embracing
the concept here.

996
01:03:53,539 --> 01:03:55,583
Pie don't work unless you let it.

997
01:03:55,750 --> 01:03:57,126
I'm gonna let it.

998
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,669
And you say we don't talk?

999
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:02,214
You go ahead. Ask me any question.
Anything you want.

1000
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:06,093
As long as it doesn't have to do
with the case. Just let her rip.

1001
01:04:08,095 --> 01:04:09,930
What's up with you and O?

1002
01:04:11,432 --> 01:04:12,099
Me and O?

1003
01:04:13,267 --> 01:04:14,685
Yeah, you and O.

1004
01:04:14,852 --> 01:04:16,187
All right, all right.

1005
01:04:16,395 --> 01:04:18,064
All right, this is it.

1006
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:22,693
A while back, I was assigned
to keep tabs on a musician.

1007
01:04:22,943 --> 01:04:23,736
Mick Jagger?

1008
01:04:23,903 --> 01:04:26,072
He's in this British band,
the Rolling Stones.

1009
01:04:26,364 --> 01:04:27,323
Rings a bell.

1010
01:04:27,490 --> 01:04:30,785
We believed he was on the planet
to breed with Earth women.

1011
01:04:30,993 --> 01:04:34,205
So I was in London
and that's when I met O.

1012
01:04:34,372 --> 01:04:38,334
Just smart. Funny. A great smile.

1013
01:04:39,460 --> 01:04:42,588
And we find ourselves in this pub,
which is a bar, all right?

1014
01:04:42,755 --> 01:04:46,759
Warm beer and the worst food
you ever ate.

1015
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:50,679
We just played darts
till the sun came up.

1016
01:04:50,846 --> 01:04:52,556
Neither of us wanted to leave.

1017
01:05:01,982 --> 01:05:04,068
What the hell happened
to you, man?

1018
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:06,946
I don't know. It hasn't happened yet.

1019
01:05:07,113 --> 01:05:11,033
Come on, what about you, slick?
In the future, you got yourself a girl?

1020
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:12,952
I got you..

1021
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:15,788
I cannot believe this,
freaking New York Mets.

1022
01:05:15,955 --> 01:05:17,331
Total losers!

1023
01:05:17,498 --> 01:05:19,291
It's a rough time
to be a Mets fan.

1024
01:05:19,458 --> 01:05:22,002
Tell me about it.
Never gonna catch the Cubs.

1025
01:05:22,336 --> 01:05:25,339
That's funny. The Mets actually
win it all this year.

1026
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:26,924
Oh, yeah.

1027
01:05:27,174 --> 01:05:27,967
No, I'm serious.

1028
01:05:28,134 --> 01:05:28,843
I'm sure.

1029
01:05:29,009 --> 01:05:31,554
Look, three months from now,
your buddies down there...

1030
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:33,889
...are gonna be calling them
the Amazing Mets...

1031
01:05:34,056 --> 01:05:36,559
...and the Miracle Mets.

1032
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:40,062
What?

1033
01:05:40,229 --> 01:05:41,897
What you got there, hoss?

1034
01:05:42,940 --> 01:05:47,361
The Archanan said, "it's amazing!
It's a miracle! I'll see you at the game."

1035
01:05:48,529 --> 01:05:49,905
I know where he is.

1036
01:05:50,698 --> 01:05:52,700
Told you to trust the pie.

1037
01:05:57,037 --> 01:06:00,541
If Griffin's here for a game,
he's either too early or too late.

1038
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:04,044
He's here. We just gotta find him
before Boris does.

1039
01:06:11,302 --> 01:06:13,220
It's time to give you
your things back...

1040
01:06:13,387 --> 01:06:14,472
...partner.

1041
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,765
You get some pie in you,
you get all mushy.

1042
01:06:16,932 --> 01:06:19,101
I'm just tired of carrying your stuff.

1043
01:06:20,394 --> 01:06:22,688
Come on now! All right! Let's go...

1044
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:23,731
...Mets!

1045
01:06:23,898 --> 01:06:26,400
Let's go, Mets! Let's go...

1046
01:06:26,567 --> 01:06:28,777
- ...Mets! Let's go, Met...
- Griffin?

1047
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:32,948
You're just in time!

1048
01:06:33,115 --> 01:06:37,453
Unless this is the one where Robinson
bad-hops it past third, it's almost over.

1049
01:06:39,580 --> 01:06:40,956
Are we missing something?

1050
01:06:41,749 --> 01:06:42,958
The game.

1051
01:07:11,612 --> 01:07:14,823
So this is how you see things?
This is amazing.

1052
01:07:14,990 --> 01:07:18,702
It's a gigantic pain in the ass.
But it has its moments.

1053
01:07:19,203 --> 01:07:21,247
This game doesn't happen
till October.

1054
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:22,748
It's always October...

1055
01:07:22,998 --> 01:07:24,583
...and November and March.

1056
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,753
So many futures, and all real.
Don't know which will coalesce.

1057
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,713
Until then, they're all happening.

1058
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:32,841
Like this one, it's my favourite moment
in human history.

1059
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:36,387
All the things that had to converge
for the Mets to win the World Series.

1060
01:07:36,554 --> 01:07:39,723
They were in last place every single
season until they won it all.

1061
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,183
You said you had a gift.

1062
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:42,184
That baseball...

1063
01:07:42,351 --> 01:07:46,272
...thrown for the last out of game five,
manufactured in '62 by Spalding...

1064
01:07:46,438 --> 01:07:49,900
...of Chicopee, Massachusetts,
was aerodynamically flawed...

1065
01:07:50,067 --> 01:07:52,403
...due to the horsehide
being improperly tanned...

1066
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:54,405
...because the tanner's wife
left him...

1067
01:07:54,572 --> 01:07:56,073
...for a Puerto Rican golf pro...

1068
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,741
The gift?

1069
01:07:57,908 --> 01:08:00,160
Oh, yes, of course. In the box.

1070
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:07,001
It's the surprise.
To protect the Earth.

1071
01:08:07,167 --> 01:08:08,043
It's a shield.

1072
01:08:12,756 --> 01:08:13,424
Shield.

1073
01:08:14,967 --> 01:08:17,511
Archanan. Arc Net.
You put up the Arc Net.

1074
01:08:17,678 --> 01:08:19,430
- How?
- When that ball is pitched to...

1075
01:08:19,597 --> 01:08:20,431
...Davey Johnson...

1076
01:08:20,598 --> 01:08:21,807
<i>...who became a player...</i>

1077
01:08:21,974 --> 01:08:25,436
<i>...because his dad couldn't find a</i>
<i>football to give him for his birthday...</i>

1078
01:08:25,603 --> 01:08:26,353
<i>it hits</i>

1079
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,480
<i>...his bat two micrometres</i>
<i>too high...</i>

1080
01:08:28,647 --> 01:08:29,982
<i>popping out to Cleon Jones...</i>

1081
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:33,068
<i>...who would've been born Clara,</i>
<i>a statistical...</i>

1082
01:08:33,277 --> 01:08:36,739
<i>...typist, if his parents didn't have</i>
<i>an extra glass of wine that night...</i>

1083
01:08:36,905 --> 01:08:38,782
<i>...before going to bed.</i>

1084
01:08:40,034 --> 01:08:40,951
<i>A miracle...</i>

1085
01:08:41,118 --> 01:08:43,621
...is what seems impossible
but happens anyway.

1086
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:54,506
I lost my planet.

1087
01:08:54,715 --> 01:08:57,092
I don't want you to lose yours.

1088
01:08:57,259 --> 01:08:59,762
It'll take a miracle,
but if you pull this off...

1089
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,972
...you'll be my new
favourite moment...

1090
01:09:02,139 --> 01:09:03,974
...in human history.

1091
01:09:04,141 --> 01:09:05,601
Oh, dear.

1092
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:07,686
I forgot to see this one coming.

1093
01:09:14,777 --> 01:09:15,861
Damn it!

1094
01:09:26,038 --> 01:09:27,206
Have these in the future?

1095
01:09:27,373 --> 01:09:28,457
No.

1096
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:29,708
Get on.

1097
01:09:33,462 --> 01:09:35,464
Keep gyro settings at zero gain.

1098
01:09:35,631 --> 01:09:38,217
Balance pitch and yaw
with bursts on the centre stalk...

1099
01:09:38,384 --> 01:09:39,760
...between 80 and 100 psi.

1100
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:41,261
I didn't understand...

1101
01:09:41,428 --> 01:09:42,846
...any of that!

1102
01:09:43,013 --> 01:09:45,099
- Gyro at zero gain.
- It is.

1103
01:09:45,265 --> 01:09:47,643
Pitch and yaw with short bursts
on the centre stalk.

1104
01:09:47,810 --> 01:09:48,477
I did!

1105
01:09:48,644 --> 01:09:50,604
Between 80 and 100 psi!

1106
01:09:51,647 --> 01:09:52,690
Got it.

1107
01:09:55,317 --> 01:09:57,194
The Arc Net! Give it to me!

1108
01:09:57,361 --> 01:09:59,238
This isn't the one where you get it!

1109
01:09:59,405 --> 01:10:01,490
- All right there, chief?
- Hell, yeah.

1110
01:10:01,657 --> 01:10:03,200
It'd be better with four wheels!

1111
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:04,702
Two is, like, my minimum.

1112
01:10:11,625 --> 01:10:14,086
What happens if Boris
gets the Arc Net?

1113
01:10:14,253 --> 01:10:16,505
Boglodite invasion,
total destruction of Earth!

1114
01:10:40,696 --> 01:10:42,406
The box!

1115
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,877
Good boy.

1116
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:56,795
We gotta stop this guy!

1117
01:10:59,047 --> 01:10:59,923
I've been trying!

1118
01:11:00,132 --> 01:11:01,467
You haven't been trying?

1119
01:11:02,009 --> 01:11:02,676
Hey, slick.

1120
01:11:03,010 --> 01:11:06,054
In the future,
we ever do the Texas two-step?

1121
01:11:06,221 --> 01:11:07,890
Yes, sir!

1122
01:11:33,332 --> 01:11:34,291
Did you get him?

1123
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,084
Give me a sec.

1124
01:11:40,506 --> 01:11:41,381
Is he dead?

1125
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,217
Negative.

1126
01:11:44,092 --> 01:11:45,302
He got away.

1127
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:49,598
I got Griffin. Let's get out of here.

1128
01:12:04,363 --> 01:12:06,448
I feel younger already.

1129
01:12:32,683 --> 01:12:36,103
You pathetic waste
of Boglodite flesh.

1130
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:39,565
I'd kill you right now,
if I didn't value my own life.

1131
01:12:39,815 --> 01:12:41,608
- Who are you?
- Look at you.

1132
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:44,820
Every mistake I've ever made,
just waiting to happen.

1133
01:12:44,987 --> 01:12:46,154
What happened to my arm?

1134
01:12:46,321 --> 01:12:48,574
You lose it, shot off by a human.

1135
01:12:48,740 --> 01:12:50,200
No human could defeat me.

1136
01:12:50,576 --> 01:12:54,830
You spend the next 40 years in prison,
chained up like an animal.

1137
01:12:54,997 --> 01:12:56,874
No prison can hold me!

1138
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,751
They built one especially for us,
on the moon.

1139
01:13:00,085 --> 01:13:01,879
No human has been to the moon...

1140
01:13:02,045 --> 01:13:04,715
...so they cannot have
built it there already.

1141
01:13:04,882 --> 01:13:07,885
Stop arguing! You can avoid
all of that if you just listen to me!

1142
01:13:08,051 --> 01:13:11,680
You were defeated!
You let it get shot off!

1143
01:13:11,847 --> 01:13:14,641
That wasn't me, that was you!

1144
01:13:19,938 --> 01:13:20,898
What's your plan?

1145
01:13:21,189 --> 01:13:23,358
Prevent the Arc Net
from being deployed.

1146
01:13:23,525 --> 01:13:26,069
- Kill anyone who tries.
- Good plan.

1147
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:27,529
Didn't work.

1148
01:13:27,696 --> 01:13:28,655
With my help...

1149
01:13:28,906 --> 01:13:31,783
...we'll get the Arc Net,
kill Agent K...

1150
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:34,244
...the invasion will be successful...

1151
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:35,996
...and we'll get to keep both...

1152
01:13:36,163 --> 01:13:38,540
...of our ar...! Stop...

1153
01:13:38,707 --> 01:13:40,208
...staring at it!

1154
01:13:41,126 --> 01:13:42,210
Listen.

1155
01:13:57,559 --> 01:14:00,812
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thank you for saving my life.

1156
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:02,022
It's what we do.

1157
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:04,358
You still have the Arc Net?

1158
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:08,737
When you're being hunted
by Boris the Animal...

1159
01:14:08,904 --> 01:14:10,614
...you get good at hiding things.

1160
01:14:36,014 --> 01:14:38,100
This will save your world.

1161
01:14:41,019 --> 01:14:43,188
Once it's outside the atmosphere,
it gets...

1162
01:14:43,355 --> 01:14:44,648
...a whole lot bigger.

1163
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:47,693
All you have to do is deploy it.

1164
01:14:48,777 --> 01:14:52,197
You mean in space?
Well, how do you suppose we do that?

1165
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:55,033
It's just one small step.

1166
01:15:09,548 --> 01:15:10,590
The moon launch.

1167
01:15:14,052 --> 01:15:15,721
Cape Canaveral.

1168
01:15:17,055 --> 01:15:19,933
July 16th, 1969.

1169
01:15:20,308 --> 01:15:21,893
We got six hours to get to Florida.

1170
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:23,603
Better get a move on, slick.

1171
01:15:23,895 --> 01:15:24,855
Wait, hold up.

1172
01:15:25,022 --> 01:15:27,149
Not us.
I'm gonna do this one alone.

1173
01:15:27,315 --> 01:15:28,233
He has to be the...

1174
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:29,276
Griffin.

1175
01:15:29,443 --> 01:15:30,569
What do you mean, alone?

1176
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:33,196
I'm gonna go to Florida.
You stay here.

1177
01:15:33,363 --> 01:15:34,614
I need you to trust me.

1178
01:15:35,073 --> 01:15:38,785
Trust you? I don't think so.
Something you're not telling me, slick?

1179
01:15:38,952 --> 01:15:40,412
You're not going to Florida.

1180
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:42,330
That ain't gonna happen, partner.

1181
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:43,874
Look, K...

1182
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,710
...please, I will not allow you
to go to Florida.

1183
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:49,546
<i>Stop me.</i>

1184
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,178
You die there!

1185
01:15:58,930 --> 01:16:02,017
Cape Canaveral. Apollo launch.

1186
01:16:03,935 --> 01:16:05,771
Boris kills you there.

1187
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:09,733
That's what I'm here for.

1188
01:16:10,358 --> 01:16:11,860
That's what I came back to stop.

1189
01:16:12,069 --> 01:16:14,029
Oh, dear. We're in this one.

1190
01:16:16,364 --> 01:16:17,324
K...

1191
01:16:18,075 --> 01:16:20,202
...I saw the file,
I looked at the report.

1192
01:16:20,368 --> 01:16:21,578
I said I told you everything...

1193
01:16:23,205 --> 01:16:24,748
That's for lying to me.

1194
01:16:24,998 --> 01:16:26,041
Look, I'm sorry, man!

1195
01:16:29,127 --> 01:16:30,837
That's for telling me the truth!

1196
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:34,007
I'm trying to protect you...

1197
01:16:35,217 --> 01:16:36,676
<i>...-man!</i>

1198
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:41,389
The bitterest truth is better
than the sweetest lies.

1199
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:46,978
He has to go to Cape Canaveral.

1200
01:16:47,145 --> 01:16:49,898
He must deploy the Arc Net
as he did before.

1201
01:16:50,065 --> 01:16:51,566
There's no other way.

1202
01:16:52,150 --> 01:16:55,320
K is the only hope in saving Earth.

1203
01:16:56,154 --> 01:16:57,697
Can I save him?

1204
01:16:58,573 --> 01:17:02,369
Is there any future
where I save his life?

1205
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,623
Yes.

1206
01:17:08,166 --> 01:17:10,377
But where there is death...

1207
01:17:11,336 --> 01:17:13,755
...there will always be death.

1208
01:17:31,606 --> 01:17:33,441
According to you,
I've done this before.

1209
01:17:33,608 --> 01:17:35,026
So we know it's possible.

1210
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,154
If you're half the agent
you say you are...

1211
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,614
...you'll make sure
I don't get killed doing it.

1212
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:45,996
So are we partners? You tell me.

1213
01:17:48,874 --> 01:17:50,458
Let's go.

1214
01:18:03,555 --> 01:18:04,472
Agent K...

1215
01:18:04,639 --> 01:18:06,057
- ...how are you?
- I'm good.

1216
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:09,394
Okay, group hug on the way
to doing what we're doing.

1217
01:18:09,561 --> 01:18:13,773
<i>This morning, man is about to launch</i>
<i>himself on a trip to the moon...</i>

1218
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:16,443
<i>...with the expectation</i>
<i>of landing there.</i>

1219
01:18:16,610 --> 01:18:18,069
Look, I gotta ask you.

1220
01:18:18,236 --> 01:18:20,614
If we pull this off,
fix things the way they were...

1221
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:22,574
...O and I, are we...?

1222
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:23,950
A wise man once told me...

1223
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:26,912
...don't ask questions you don't
want to know the answer to.

1224
01:18:28,246 --> 01:18:30,916
- I said that, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

1225
01:18:35,587 --> 01:18:37,047
Here they are.

1226
01:18:37,923 --> 01:18:40,050
- What are they?
- Jetpacks.

1227
01:18:40,217 --> 01:18:41,760
Jetpacks?

1228
01:18:42,844 --> 01:18:45,597
No, no, no.
We're not doing jetpacks.

1229
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:48,099
There's a reason we don't
have these in the future.

1230
01:18:48,266 --> 01:18:49,267
K, we gotta drive.

1231
01:18:49,684 --> 01:18:52,646
Can't drive to Florida from Manhattan
in five hours, chief.

1232
01:18:52,938 --> 01:18:56,858
Yeah, we can. The red button,
standard issue in every MiB car.

1233
01:18:57,025 --> 01:18:58,902
Press the red button,
goes into hyperdrive.

1234
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:00,862
No red buttons yet, slick.

1235
01:19:02,614 --> 01:19:04,741
Come on, man.

1236
01:19:09,829 --> 01:19:10,664
Do you know...

1237
01:19:10,830 --> 01:19:12,123
...how to work this thing?

1238
01:19:12,290 --> 01:19:14,417
It's like with anything.

1239
01:19:14,584 --> 01:19:18,505
Just have to strap yourself in,
hope for the best.

1240
01:19:19,631 --> 01:19:20,924
Isn't that right, Miss O?

1241
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,302
Unfortunately, it is.

1242
01:19:35,480 --> 01:19:36,773
You ready, slick?

1243
01:19:38,650 --> 01:19:40,193
Let's get it.

1244
01:19:40,402 --> 01:19:42,237
This is gonna be interesting!

1245
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,460
<i>It's just minutes to the</i>

1246
01:19:57,669 --> 01:19:59,296
<i>...historic launch of Apollo 11...</i>

1247
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,798
<i>with all going well</i>

1248
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:21,359
I'm so glad this isn't
one of the times we explode.

1249
01:20:21,609 --> 01:20:23,320
One of the times?

1250
01:20:26,156 --> 01:20:27,699
Oh, we got company.

1251
01:20:32,245 --> 01:20:33,705
The hell?

1252
01:20:35,290 --> 01:20:37,250
Is that a battery belt?

1253
01:20:47,135 --> 01:20:48,678
All right, I got it.

1254
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:54,434
No, any reality
that gets the shield deployed...

1255
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,394
...is one where you tell the truth.

1256
01:20:56,770 --> 01:20:58,146
The truth?

1257
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:00,482
The truth is the only path.

1258
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:02,359
This is a restricted area!

1259
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:09,366
Yes, sir, it is.

1260
01:21:09,532 --> 01:21:12,494
Good day, gentlemen.
Great day for America, isn't it?

1261
01:21:12,660 --> 01:21:16,331
My name is Agent J.
This is Agent K. That's Griff.

1262
01:21:16,498 --> 01:21:18,583
We're from a secret government
organization...

1263
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:22,337
...that polices and monitors
alien activity on and off planet Earth.

1264
01:21:23,755 --> 01:21:24,881
Here's the thing.

1265
01:21:25,048 --> 01:21:27,509
We have this special
little metal thingy...

1266
01:21:27,675 --> 01:21:31,471
...that Griff gave us that we have
to get on top of that rocket...

1267
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:35,266
...to prevent an alien invasion.

1268
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:39,646
That worked.

1269
01:21:39,813 --> 01:21:42,524
- Like a charm.
- Sir, Delta Gate. We have a problem.

1270
01:21:42,857 --> 01:21:46,236
Three trespassers. No IDs,
but they've got weapons, sir.

1271
01:21:46,444 --> 01:21:48,613
Some kind I've never seen before.

1272
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:57,914
What breed of fool
do you have to be...

1273
01:21:58,081 --> 01:22:01,000
...to penetrate my site
on the day of the most massive feat...

1274
01:22:01,167 --> 01:22:02,419
...attempted by mankind?

1275
01:22:02,585 --> 01:22:05,505
Watched by God, the population
of the planet and my own...

1276
01:22:05,672 --> 01:22:06,798
- ...firstborn!
- Colonel?

1277
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:08,842
Colonel, they had these.

1278
01:22:10,009 --> 01:22:12,178
They said they needed
to put something on the rocket...

1279
01:22:12,345 --> 01:22:13,513
...for an invasion.

1280
01:22:17,725 --> 01:22:18,726
Thanks.

1281
01:22:18,935 --> 01:22:20,186
I got 10 minutes to launch.

1282
01:22:20,437 --> 01:22:24,482
If you pose a threat to that rocket,
you tell me now and do not lie to me.

1283
01:22:28,903 --> 01:22:30,905
I told the truth last time.

1284
01:22:35,910 --> 01:22:37,704
Sir, this man came here from...

1285
01:22:37,912 --> 01:22:39,289
...the future to protect me...

1286
01:22:39,456 --> 01:22:42,876
...so I can attach a shield to the top
of that rocket and save the world.

1287
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:45,003
I need your help to do that.

1288
01:22:48,173 --> 01:22:49,466
Take them to the brig.

1289
01:22:49,632 --> 01:22:51,134
You're slipping, Griff.

1290
01:22:51,676 --> 01:22:52,844
Sir, if I may.

1291
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:09,777
Corporal.

1292
01:23:11,196 --> 01:23:12,530
You men are no longer needed.

1293
01:23:13,031 --> 01:23:14,157
I'll take the prisoners.

1294
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:16,367
- Sir, are you...?
- Dismissed.

1295
01:23:25,210 --> 01:23:26,211
Follow me.

1296
01:23:33,593 --> 01:23:35,762
You did the future thing.
What did you show him?

1297
01:23:35,929 --> 01:23:38,056
Only what he needed to see.

1298
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:40,767
I have to go now.

1299
01:23:41,893 --> 01:23:43,311
What? No, no, no. Come on.

1300
01:23:43,728 --> 01:23:45,230
You don't need me anymore.

1301
01:23:45,647 --> 01:23:48,024
All right, Griff,
don't start flipping on me.

1302
01:23:48,191 --> 01:23:51,653
When Boris' arm is taken, the past
will be as it was. K will survive.

1303
01:23:51,819 --> 01:23:53,780
He will not know
you were ever here.

1304
01:23:55,490 --> 01:23:59,577
All right. Arm gone, got it.
Like a reset?

1305
01:23:59,744 --> 01:24:02,997
When that happens, go home.
Leave.

1306
01:24:03,164 --> 01:24:03,831
You coming?

1307
01:24:03,998 --> 01:24:06,000
Yeah, all right!

1308
01:24:07,961 --> 01:24:10,421
Thanks, man.
Hey, will I ever see you again?

1309
01:24:10,672 --> 01:24:12,465
Anything's possible.

1310
01:24:15,093 --> 01:24:16,469
Oh, Griff.

1311
01:24:22,767 --> 01:24:25,270
I can never bear to watch this part.

1312
01:24:27,188 --> 01:24:28,856
<i>Armstrong and Aldrin</i>
<i>are scheduled...</i>

1313
01:24:29,023 --> 01:24:30,942
<i>...to set foot on the moon...</i>

1314
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:35,071
<i>...on early Monday morning,</i>
<i>Eastern Daylight Time.</i>

1315
01:24:36,447 --> 01:24:37,198
Where's Griffin?

1316
01:24:37,407 --> 01:24:39,158
Doing his own thing.

1317
01:25:01,806 --> 01:25:02,515
Gentlemen.

1318
01:25:06,603 --> 01:25:08,855
This elevator
will take you to the top.

1319
01:25:09,022 --> 01:25:11,024
To get the Arc Net
outside the atmosphere...

1320
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,193
...you need to strap it to the escape
rocket above the capsule!

1321
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:15,737
You do not want to be...

1322
01:25:15,903 --> 01:25:18,156
...anywhere near this rocket
when it takes off!

1323
01:25:18,323 --> 01:25:20,700
- Questions?
- No. Thank you for this, colonel.

1324
01:25:20,867 --> 01:25:22,452
Some job you got there.

1325
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:23,870
Hey, thanks a lot, bro.

1326
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:26,539
What did Griff
show you back there?

1327
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:28,124
How important you are.

1328
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,043
You and your partner.

1329
01:25:38,301 --> 01:25:40,720
If everything goes right
the way we hope it does...

1330
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:43,640
...I'm gonna end up
getting out of here pretty quick...

1331
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:47,226
...so I'm not gonna have a chance
to say a proper goodbye.

1332
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:50,938
If things go wrong,
not gonna have a chance to, either.

1333
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,525
So I guess win or lose, this is it.

1334
01:25:59,072 --> 01:26:00,948
I see why I recruited you.

1335
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:04,911
You're a good man.

1336
01:26:08,414 --> 01:26:10,041
Good man.

1337
01:26:12,502 --> 01:26:14,754
Man, what the hell
happened to you?

1338
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,507
I told you,
it still hasn't happened yet.

1339
01:26:22,345 --> 01:26:24,055
I'll take this one!

1340
01:26:24,430 --> 01:26:25,556
Naught)'

1341
01:26:28,267 --> 01:26:30,311
Get a pedicure if you get a second.

1342
01:26:40,238 --> 01:26:42,365
And liftoff.

1343
01:27:23,823 --> 01:27:25,533
<i>Just passed the two-minute mark...</i>

1344
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:29,162
<i>...in the countdown, and all is still go</i>
<i>as we monitor our status board.</i>

1345
01:27:50,475 --> 01:27:53,269
<i>Astronauts report it feels good.</i>
<i>Power transfer is complete.</i>

1346
01:27:54,020 --> 01:27:56,981
<i>Neil Armstrong just reported back</i>
<i>it's been a smooth countdown.</i>

1347
01:28:09,577 --> 01:28:10,620
Hey!

1348
01:28:10,870 --> 01:28:12,497
Boris, can you give me a hand?

1349
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,457
Hey.

1350
01:28:19,170 --> 01:28:19,921
Hey!

1351
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:22,507
You hear me calling you?

1352
01:28:23,382 --> 01:28:24,884
Boris the Animal!

1353
01:28:25,384 --> 01:28:26,052
Hey!

1354
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:28,387
Boris the Animal!

1355
01:28:30,264 --> 01:28:32,642
It's just Boris!

1356
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:37,522
You're gonna lose.

1357
01:28:37,814 --> 01:28:39,065
Let's agree to disagree.

1358
01:28:58,709 --> 01:28:59,877
Hey!

1359
01:29:00,920 --> 01:29:02,547
Boris the Animal!

1360
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:13,307
Right.

1361
01:29:14,141 --> 01:29:14,809
Left.

1362
01:29:42,879 --> 01:29:43,796
You're gonna lose.

1363
01:29:43,963 --> 01:29:46,007
Let's agree to disagree.

1364
01:29:54,891 --> 01:29:56,267
Hey!

1365
01:29:56,976 --> 01:29:58,769
Boris the Animal!

1366
01:30:05,693 --> 01:30:06,402
Right.

1367
01:30:06,777 --> 01:30:08,321
Left. Left.

1368
01:30:09,405 --> 01:30:10,156
Right.

1369
01:30:14,243 --> 01:30:16,203
That's not possible.

1370
01:30:16,495 --> 01:30:18,414
Let's agree to disagree.

1371
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:26,797
That's not possible!

1372
01:30:36,098 --> 01:30:37,099
K!

1373
01:30:38,768 --> 01:30:41,103
I win! I'm better than me!

1374
01:30:48,527 --> 01:30:49,779
That's my partner.

1375
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:52,073
That's my partner!

1376
01:30:58,287 --> 01:30:59,330
If we call this in...

1377
01:30:59,497 --> 01:31:02,166
- ...they'll scrub the launch.
- I didn't see anything.

1378
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:38,744
- Where's your partner?
- He went home.

1379
01:31:38,911 --> 01:31:40,413
- How does that work?
- You got me.

1380
01:31:40,579 --> 01:31:41,872
Come on!

1381
01:31:56,721 --> 01:31:57,513
Get down!

1382
01:32:28,586 --> 01:32:29,920
Bingo.

1383
01:32:30,838 --> 01:32:32,923
Man, that is some next-level stuff.

1384
01:32:42,933 --> 01:32:44,268
You ever want to see more...

1385
01:32:44,477 --> 01:32:47,772
...I know a top-secret organization
that could use a man like you.

1386
01:32:49,690 --> 01:32:51,358
I wish I could.

1387
01:32:51,942 --> 01:32:52,902
Thank you.

1388
01:32:53,527 --> 01:32:55,404
I'll see you around, K.

1389
01:32:57,156 --> 01:32:57,823
Look out!

1390
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,789
Go ahead.

1391
01:33:05,039 --> 01:33:06,791
Arrest me.

1392
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:10,044
Not this time.

1393
01:33:20,054 --> 01:33:23,057
"Where there's death,
there will always be death."

1394
01:33:32,399 --> 01:33:35,653
Daddy! Daddy!

1395
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:40,533
Hey.

1396
01:33:41,575 --> 01:33:43,536
Hey, my name's K.
What's your name?

1397
01:33:44,078 --> 01:33:45,121
James.

1398
01:33:45,287 --> 01:33:47,832
James? That's a nice name.

1399
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,375
Where's my dad?

1400
01:33:52,253 --> 01:33:54,130
What have you got there?
What is that?

1401
01:33:54,296 --> 01:33:55,673
My dad gave it to me.

1402
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:58,092
We timed the launch.

1403
01:34:05,224 --> 01:34:07,017
Where is my daddy?

1404
01:34:11,105 --> 01:34:12,523
He...

1405
01:34:13,107 --> 01:34:16,861
He went to go do something
very special.

1406
01:34:17,027 --> 01:34:18,904
And he wanted me...

1407
01:34:19,071 --> 01:34:23,409
...to stay here and take care
of his best pal.

1408
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:30,457
When is he gonna be back?

1409
01:34:31,625 --> 01:34:33,002
He...

1410
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:49,268
James...

1411
01:34:50,644 --> 01:34:52,438
...if you look right here...

1412
01:34:52,605 --> 01:34:55,816
...I will tell you the only thing
you ever need to know.

1413
01:35:01,322 --> 01:35:03,115
Your daddy is a hero.

1414
01:35:03,324 --> 01:35:05,784
My daddy is a hero?

1415
01:35:08,996 --> 01:35:12,291
- Want to take a walk with me?
- Yes.

1416
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:23,135
James?

1417
01:36:05,511 --> 01:36:07,179
You're late.

1418
01:36:07,346 --> 01:36:09,598
Sorry. Lost track of time.

1419
01:36:11,558 --> 01:36:12,768
How do you know that song?

1420
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:15,187
Drink your coffee.
We got work to do.

1421
01:36:16,063 --> 01:36:17,856
What do you know
and what do you don't?

1422
01:36:18,023 --> 01:36:19,733
How do I know what I don't know?

1423
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:22,820
That's a really good question.
Did we go to Wu's last night?

1424
01:36:22,987 --> 01:36:23,737
Yeah.

1425
01:36:24,071 --> 01:36:24,947
Boglodites?

1426
01:36:25,114 --> 01:36:25,906
Extinct for 40 years.

1427
01:36:26,323 --> 01:36:28,575
Perfect. Did we talk
on the phone last night?

1428
01:36:28,742 --> 01:36:29,994
You hung up on me.

1429
01:36:30,411 --> 01:36:32,037
Yeah, I did.

1430
01:36:33,080 --> 01:36:35,249
But that was because
of all those secrets...

1431
01:36:35,791 --> 01:36:38,711
...the universe doesn't know about.

1432
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:44,216
But...

1433
01:36:44,591 --> 01:36:46,385
...I've realised that...

1434
01:36:46,552 --> 01:36:49,054
...last night was a long...

1435
01:36:49,221 --> 01:36:51,515
...long time ago.

1436
01:36:55,769 --> 01:36:58,522
And, really,
I just want to say thank you.

1437
01:36:59,106 --> 01:37:01,108
It's been my privilege.

1438
01:37:10,951 --> 01:37:13,370
You know, there's a really
high possibility now...

1439
01:37:13,537 --> 01:37:16,123
...that I might know some things
you don't know.

1440
01:37:16,290 --> 01:37:17,875
I doubt it.

1441
01:37:18,042 --> 01:37:20,002
I bet I know what went down
with you and O.

1442
01:37:20,169 --> 01:37:22,087
She's a fine lady,
but you know the rules.

1443
01:37:22,254 --> 01:37:24,423
There's no fraternizing
amongst agents.

1444
01:37:24,590 --> 01:37:27,301
I think y'all might have fraternized
a time or two.

1445
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:33,807
This is my new favourite moment
in human history.

1446
01:37:33,974 --> 01:37:37,227
Unless this is the one
where K forgot to leave a tip.

1447
01:37:51,825 --> 01:37:53,702
Almost forgot.

1448
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:03,962
That was a close one.
