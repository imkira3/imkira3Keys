1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,074

2
00:00:23,974 --> 00:00:25,476
Ho ho ho.

3
00:01:05,182 --> 00:01:07,976
All right, class,
if a reindeer leaves Elfsburg

4
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:10,104
flying west at 20 miles per hour,

5
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:13,941
and another reindeer flies east
travelling at 50 miles per hour,

6
00:01:14,024 --> 00:01:17,736
how many hours does it take
for them to be 210 miles apart?

7
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:20,989
Anyone?

8
00:01:22,866 --> 00:01:25,869
Anyone?

9
00:01:26,662 --> 00:01:28,414
Trish.

10
00:01:28,497 --> 00:01:30,749
How come we can't learn
things we want to?

11
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,835
- Like what?
- Like...

12
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:36,380
Was it weird when you married Santa
and had to move up to the Pole

13
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,173
and give up your old life?

14
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:41,260
Weirder than you can
possibly imagine.

15
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:43,971
But then something
so gigantic happened

16
00:01:44,054 --> 00:01:46,181
that it changed
Santa and me forever.

17
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:47,766
Like what?

18
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,520
OK.

19
00:01:51,645 --> 00:01:53,439
Baby Claus is on the way.

20
00:01:53,522 --> 00:01:56,608
Ladies, keep up.
Please, hot water and hot ointments.

21
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,944
You, think sugar plums.
Do not panic!

22
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:00,696
Do not panic!

23
00:02:00,779 --> 00:02:03,949
- Curtis, the baby's coming.
- Cocoa, the baby's coming.

24
00:02:04,074 --> 00:02:06,910
- Mrs Claus, the baby's coming.
- I know!

25
00:02:15,377 --> 00:02:16,670
Deep breaths.

26
00:02:17,629 --> 00:02:19,506
That's gonna leave a mark.

27
00:02:32,936 --> 00:02:34,146
Push.

28
00:02:38,984 --> 00:02:41,028
Oh.

29
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:43,697
- Oh, Scott.
- Everything's gonna be all right.

30
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:47,242
- Where's Dr Hismus?
- Oh, oh, Scott.

31
00:02:47,326 --> 00:02:48,911
I'm right here, babe.

32
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,871
I'm right here. It's all right.

33
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:52,873
Honey, it was a false alarm.

34
00:02:52,956 --> 00:02:54,583
Again?

35
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,877
I stopped a pedicure for this?

36
00:03:12,184 --> 00:03:14,144
Scott! Scott, come here.

37
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:16,521
Come here just for a second. Come here.

38
00:03:16,605 --> 00:03:19,942
Scott, come here.
Come here, come here, come here.

39
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:22,027
OK.

40
00:03:24,321 --> 00:03:26,239
Ready? Wait for the kick.

41
00:03:30,661 --> 00:03:31,995
- He's a genius.
- He?

42
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,831
She. She's brilliant like her mother,

43
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,043
- with rhythm like her dad.
- Yes. But not amazing timing.

44
00:03:38,126 --> 00:03:40,337
I wish the baby
had come this afternoon,

45
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,214
or last week like we thought.

46
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,675
I'm going crazy.
I'm really going crazy.

47
00:03:46,718 --> 00:03:49,680
- You need a diversion.
- No, no, Scott.

48
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:52,349
No more gifts.
You already gave me a necklace,

49
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:55,310
- oven mitts, the cheese wheel.
- This is not for you.

50
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,021
This is for the baby.
I'll be back in a jiff.

51
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,359
Ho ho!

52
00:04:02,484 --> 00:04:06,279
Ho!

53
00:04:06,405 --> 00:04:09,616
- Ho!
- That never gets old.

54
00:04:09,741 --> 00:04:12,369
OK, now what do we have
in the bag for a baby?

55
00:04:12,452 --> 00:04:15,789
Well, oddly enough,
we have a baby bag.

56
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,958
And inside that baby bag,

57
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,001
let's see what it is...
We have...

58
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,046
Oh.

59
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,592
Oh, Scott! Oh, honey,
it's beautiful!

60
00:04:27,676 --> 00:04:29,553
The baby's gonna love it.

61
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:31,847
Yeah. It spins around like this.

62
00:04:33,682 --> 00:04:36,560
Oh. Later. Come on in.

63
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:40,063
- Hey, doc.
- Dr Hismus, I'm glad you could come.

64
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:41,356
How are you today?

65
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,568
I'm a little concerned
because the baby hasn't come yet.

66
00:04:44,651 --> 00:04:46,194
No need to worry, Mrs Claus.

67
00:04:46,278 --> 00:04:50,657
Santa! Production has been so behind
we need you on the floor immediately.

68
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:55,120
I can't come down now. It's impossible.
I'm still mapping out the sleigh route.

69
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:58,540
- Got plenty of work here.
- Have you checked this list once?

70
00:04:58,623 --> 00:05:01,501
- I perused it.
- Help me help you. Help me help you.

71
00:05:01,585 --> 00:05:03,920
Let's start with
your blood pressure, OK?

72
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,549
Help me help you,
help you help you help me,

73
00:05:07,632 --> 00:05:10,510
- help me help you.
- Don't be nervous.

74
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:14,556
- It'll be done before you know it.
- Help you help me help you... help me.

75
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,932
Help you.

76
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:21,771
One more thing. The Council of Legendary
Figures called an emergency meeting.

77
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:24,483
I can't leave the North Pole
and go to a meeting.

78
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,818
- They know. That's why they came.
- Here?

79
00:05:26,902 --> 00:05:29,321
- Where? In the kitchen?
- In the kitchen.

80
00:05:29,404 --> 00:05:32,449
- Is there an echo in here?
- OK, OK. You know what?

81
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,910
Sweetheart, I'm feeling so much better.

82
00:05:34,993 --> 00:05:39,372
I think that I'm going to go...
on a walk, which is great for the baby.

83
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:43,376
You stay here and have
your blood pressure taken,

84
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,380
which is great, and I'm gonna go see
what's down the hall.

85
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,181
Hi, ladies.

86
00:05:57,766 --> 00:05:59,226
Honey?

87
00:06:00,393 --> 00:06:01,728
Honey.

88
00:06:03,688 --> 00:06:06,066
- Carol.
- Anything I can do for you, ma'am?

89
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,817
No, thanks.

90
00:06:10,195 --> 00:06:12,948
- Care for some company?
- Not from you, Mr Claus.

91
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:15,116
- Why not?
- You can't spend time with me

92
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:17,744
and get toys ready,
I understand completely.

93
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:19,913
- You do?
- Of course I do.

94
00:06:19,996 --> 00:06:23,708
I just hope you're not delivering
when I'm delivering.

95
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,795
I'm not gonna let that happen.

96
00:06:26,878 --> 00:06:28,797
Carol, there's no way I could...

97
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,092
Nice chrome work, Lenny.
That is so workin'!

98
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:34,469
- Thanks, Santa.
- Yeah, baby, yeah.

99
00:06:34,552 --> 00:06:35,720
All right.

100
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:40,517
Look, I know this is all
a bit overwhelming to you,

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,394
but... wait a minute. Stop.

102
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:45,230
Did you see this?
Amazing technology.

103
00:06:45,313 --> 00:06:48,358
Look at this. It's a duck.
It quacks in three languages.

104
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,151
<i>El ducko says "quacko."</i>

105
00:06:50,235 --> 00:06:53,279
<i>Le duck says "quack."
II duck-e say "quack-e."</i>

106
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:55,532
Things can't help me right now.

107
00:06:55,615 --> 00:06:58,910
<i>- Hey, come back-e.
- It's people that I need.</i>

108
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,246
You know, family.

109
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,623
Ho ho ho ho! Family?

110
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:06,584
We are your family.
Elves, we're her family, right?

111
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:10,422
We love you, Mrs Claus.

112
00:07:11,423 --> 00:07:13,216
Taller family.

113
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:19,556
Human family.

114
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:22,225
Oh, sweetheart, anything but the tears.

115
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:24,352
- I'm sorry. Thank you.
- It's OK.

116
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:28,023
It's an impossible situation.

117
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:31,067
If I didn't want to be with you
so much, I would go home.

118
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:33,236
But I can't have it both ways.

119
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,322
I guess I just...

120
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,201
Wait a minute.

121
00:07:41,369 --> 00:07:43,288
Hey. Maybe you can.

122
00:07:43,371 --> 00:07:46,249
- I can what?
- Have it both ways.

123
00:07:46,332 --> 00:07:48,585
- How?
- I can bring home here.

124
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,295
- You can?
- You can?

125
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:52,589
I'm gonna bring
your parents up here.

126
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:54,591
- My parents?
- Her parents?

127
00:07:54,674 --> 00:07:56,885
Elves!

128
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,678
Sir, the SOS.

129
00:07:58,762 --> 00:08:02,015
- Excuse me?
- SOS. Secret of Santa.

130
00:08:02,098 --> 00:08:04,142
There could be dire consequences.

131
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:07,520
The possibilities increase
exponentially that the secret

132
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:10,482
of the North Pole's location
could be compromised.

133
00:08:10,565 --> 00:08:14,027
Christmas would cease to exist,
crushing the hopes and dreams

134
00:08:14,152 --> 00:08:18,364
of the world's children and
extinguishing the joy of Santa's magic!

135
00:08:20,241 --> 00:08:22,452
There's that.

136
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:25,163
He has a point.
My parents can't keep a secret.

137
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:28,666
Listen, honey, the reason
you came up here was because of me.

138
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,085
I'll do what it takes
to make this right.

139
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:32,754
- You will?
- Yeah.

140
00:08:32,837 --> 00:08:35,423
Yes. Yeah, I will.

141
00:08:35,507 --> 00:08:38,259
You know why?
Cause what do they say about Santa?

142
00:08:38,343 --> 00:08:41,471
- He delivers!
- Yes!

143
00:08:41,554 --> 00:08:45,558
How will you pull it off? My parents
think you're a toymaker in Canada.

144
00:08:45,642 --> 00:08:47,310
How am I gonna pull this off?

145
00:08:55,652 --> 00:08:58,613
The answer is in the question.

146
00:08:58,696 --> 00:09:03,493
"How are we going to do this? My dad
thinks you're a toymaker in Canada."

147
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,703
- Canada?
- Canada.

148
00:09:05,787 --> 00:09:08,331
It's north, in North America, eh?

149
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,166
Vinegar on their French fries,

150
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:13,002
they sit on their chesterfield
to watch hockey.

151
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,838
Shoot the puck, daddy-o!
Come on, everybody!

152
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,882
Elves, everybody listen up.

153
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:54,043
Grab your hammers,
the in-laws are coming.

154
00:09:54,043 --> 00:09:56,587
Hey, Robbie.
Virgil, let me see your teeth.

155
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,965
That's good. Hiya, elves.

156
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:01,467
- Hi, Tooth Fairy.
- Open up. Let me see.

157
00:10:02,468 --> 00:10:03,469
Beautiful teeth.

158
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,853
Open the doors if
you want to fall in love!

159
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:14,188
Everybody, look,
Cupid in the house.

160
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:16,899
Oh, work, work, work.
That's nice to see.

161
00:10:17,025 --> 00:10:18,901
- Hi, Cupid.
- What'd I miss?

162
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,194
Where's fat boy?

163
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,280
Merry Christmas, everybody.

164
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,157
Cupid, what's up?
Hey, EB.

165
00:10:24,282 --> 00:10:26,576
- Santa.
- Molarnator.

166
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:29,245
Sandman.

167
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,039
Mother Nature, Father Time.

168
00:10:31,164 --> 00:10:34,125
Merry Christmas, again.
Good to see everyone.

169
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,295
You think it's necessary
to call an emergency meeting?

170
00:10:37,378 --> 00:10:40,131
I'm ready to ride the sleigh,
know what I mean?

171
00:10:40,214 --> 00:10:42,550
We thought you should see this.

172
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,761
Silver bells!

173
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,723
I found 270 of them at shopping malls
scattered across the Northwest.

174
00:10:48,806 --> 00:10:52,769
I hereby call this session of the
Council of Legendary Figures to order.

175
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,978
This is ridiculous.

176
00:10:54,062 --> 00:10:56,522
- Sandman!
- I'm up, I'm up!

177
00:10:56,606 --> 00:10:58,775
Hey, Cupid, nice skirt.

178
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:03,237
Easter Bunny.

179
00:11:03,321 --> 00:11:05,990
Our first and only
order of business

180
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:10,203
is the disciplinary action to be taken
against council member Jack Frost.

181
00:11:10,286 --> 00:11:13,164
Now that's what I'm talking about.

182
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:17,835
You love it. Am I right?

183
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:21,422
You guys finally woke up
and are giving me my own holiday.

184
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,176
Frostmas, of course,
is just a placeholder.

185
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:28,721
I'm wide open.
Frostgiving, the Frost of July.

186
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,724
Frosthog Day,
the possibilities are endless.

187
00:11:31,808 --> 00:11:34,310
Jack, you are hereby
charged with 273 counts

188
00:11:34,393 --> 00:11:37,146
of attempted upstaging of Santa Claus.

189
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,900
You froze a volcano in Hawaii,
you made it snow in the Amazon

190
00:11:40,983 --> 00:11:44,904
and you frosted Mexico, sending all
of the geese north for the winter.

191
00:11:44,987 --> 00:11:47,824
You violated
the Legendary Figures code of conduct

192
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,159
in a manner that is
wilful and malicious.

193
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:54,163
Excuse me. Did you just accuse me
of being skilful and delicious?

194
00:11:54,247 --> 00:11:55,915
- Please.
- Guilty as charged.

195
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:59,418
You herald the season.
You're not a holiday.

196
00:11:59,502 --> 00:12:01,963
You're the best friend,
not the leading man.

197
00:12:02,046 --> 00:12:03,756
And you kill fruit.

198
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:08,302
All in favour of suspending Jack Frost
from the Legendary Council, say...

199
00:12:08,386 --> 00:12:10,680
Wait a minute!
Father Time, wait a minute.

200
00:12:10,805 --> 00:12:14,642
You gotta understand,
I have enormous untapped potential.

201
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:18,062
But all I am year after year
is an opening act.

202
00:12:18,145 --> 00:12:19,855
A setup man for Mr Big.

203
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,816
- Why don't you let that go?
- No.

204
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,402
We have the same conversation
every year.

205
00:12:24,527 --> 00:12:26,737
You get the soda cans
and the TV specials.

206
00:12:26,862 --> 00:12:28,864
The postage stamps,
the billboards,

207
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,577
the beautiful adoring wife,
and the army of toy-building yes men.

208
00:12:32,702 --> 00:12:35,788
What do I get?
A few runny noses and some dead citrus.

209
00:12:35,871 --> 00:12:38,666
You know, Jack,
it's no picnic being me.

210
00:12:38,749 --> 00:12:43,462
Because of problems an entire continent
might go without toys. That's right.

211
00:12:43,546 --> 00:12:48,217
On top of that, I've got to protect the
secret of Santa because the in-laws...

212
00:12:48,301 --> 00:12:51,929
Mr and Mrs In-Bad-Mood-Every-Time-
l-Turn-Around are coming.

213
00:12:52,013 --> 00:12:54,765
Not supposed to,
gotta come up with a solution.

214
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:57,977
On top of that, I'm worried
about being a father again

215
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:01,272
because I wasn't all that good at it
the first time.

216
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,607
Oh, Santa.

217
00:13:03,691 --> 00:13:04,942
We had no idea.

218
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:07,278
Oh, Santa, I'm sorry.

219
00:13:07,361 --> 00:13:11,324
If it were me in the red suit, I'd
probably go right to the Escape Clause.

220
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:14,535
Oh, no, the Escape Clause.
Way too extreme. Really.

221
00:13:14,618 --> 00:13:17,121
Escape Clause?
What's up with that?

222
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:20,750
Maybe if you'd attend a meeting
once in a while you'd know.

223
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:24,628
You can manipulate time
but can't grow hair.

224
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:26,964
Legendary?
I don't think so.

225
00:13:28,299 --> 00:13:30,676
I am not evoking the Escape Clause.

226
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,928
I made a commitment.
I'll handle the toys

227
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:35,514
and be there when
my wife delivers that baby.

228
00:13:35,598 --> 00:13:37,850
- Let me help.
- You've done quite enough.

229
00:13:37,933 --> 00:13:40,061
No, no, no.
Instead of a suspension,

230
00:13:40,144 --> 00:13:42,396
- how about community service?
- Please.

231
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,398
What if... what if I...

232
00:13:44,482 --> 00:13:47,485
What if I tutor myself
at the elbow of the master?

233
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:51,405
Huh? I could lend a hand.
Make some toys, wrap a few presents.

234
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:56,202
And if I don't make it with the hefty
man, he says the word you suspend me.

235
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,538
Please, Santa.

236
00:13:59,622 --> 00:14:03,417
I know I don't deserve another chance,
but I am asking you for one.

237
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:08,047
I want to make things right.

238
00:14:15,137 --> 00:14:16,138
All right.

239
00:14:16,263 --> 00:14:20,101
You don't want to get suspended?
I'll give you one more chance.

240
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,770
But you have to be a
Jack-Frost-of-all-trades.

241
00:14:22,895 --> 00:14:25,272
- You have to listen to the elves.
- Uh-huh.

242
00:14:25,356 --> 00:14:27,566
Curtis is your boss.
And I mean it.

243
00:14:27,691 --> 00:14:30,444
If there's one,
one icicle out of place,

244
00:14:30,528 --> 00:14:34,156
- you are gone.
- I will not let you down.

245
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:48,504
Motion carried.

246
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:50,548
Ho ho ho!

247
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:53,509
Boys, boys, save it
for the stables, will you?

248
00:14:55,344 --> 00:14:57,096
Look there. They got a new roof.

249
00:14:57,179 --> 00:14:58,264
Easy, easy!

250
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:01,016
Uncle Scott is here!

251
00:15:02,393 --> 00:15:04,687
Lucy! Coat!

252
00:15:07,857 --> 00:15:09,191
Comet!

253
00:15:09,275 --> 00:15:12,486
Next time we fly, go easy
on the alfalfa, will you?

254
00:15:14,697 --> 00:15:17,324
- Uncle Scott.
- Hey, Luce. There we are.

255
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:19,952
- There it is.
- All warm?

256
00:15:20,035 --> 00:15:23,414
Just like magic.
You have the warmest hug in the world.

257
00:15:23,497 --> 00:15:26,542
- Hello.
- Hi, Comet!

258
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,669
- Hey, son.
- Hi, Dad.

259
00:15:28,752 --> 00:15:31,171
I missed you so much. Hi.

260
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:35,384
A few days early, aren't you?
Isn't that baby due any moment?

261
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:38,470
Oh, we got lots
to talk about. Hey, Neil.

262
00:15:38,554 --> 00:15:41,599
That's a...
That's a good-looking sweater vest.

263
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:43,809
- It's reversible.
- Of course it is.

264
00:15:43,892 --> 00:15:46,312
- Let's go inside.
- Lucy, come on.

265
00:15:52,443 --> 00:15:54,528
Look at that,
it's snowing in Hawaii.

266
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:57,656
Yeah. It's not really magical
like the one Charlie has,

267
00:15:57,740 --> 00:16:01,327
but I love it.
And now I have 12. See?

268
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:06,874
You know, I have
quite the snow globe collection myself.

269
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,586
- How's Danielle doing?
- Good.

270
00:16:10,669 --> 00:16:13,380
Thanks for letting me
go snowboarding with her.

271
00:16:13,464 --> 00:16:17,092
You're welcome.
Hey, I brought you something.

272
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,262
Just a little thing.
Oh, boy.

273
00:16:20,387 --> 00:16:22,097
What a mess in here.

274
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:34,443
There we are.

275
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,446
Wedged behind a wheelbarrow.

276
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,281
Dad! That's awesome!

277
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:41,950
- Thank goodness it wasn't a car.
- Thanks, Dad.

278
00:16:42,076 --> 00:16:43,827
Wow, this is beautiful.

279
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:46,080
Lucy, sweetheart,
what are you doing?

280
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,915
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

281
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,209
Come on out. Come out here. Come here.

282
00:16:50,292 --> 00:16:52,920
- Get out of the bag.
- Why can't I fit inside?

283
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:54,463
It takes a lot of practice.

284
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:57,174
I wish I could come
to the North Pole with you.

285
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:59,551
I could help Carol a lot
and she loves me.

286
00:16:59,635 --> 00:17:02,346
That's true. And hey,

287
00:17:02,429 --> 00:17:06,141
maybe I should be the one
there for Carol.

288
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,268
You know?
I mean, another mom.

289
00:17:08,352 --> 00:17:10,354
I could... I could help.

290
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:13,273
- Hey, maybe...
- Girls.

291
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:16,652
I've got a full sleigh.
You understand my situation.

292
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:18,987
Now, wait a minute, Scott.

293
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:20,989
Let's pause a moment here...

294
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:23,700
...and take a feelings inventory.

295
00:17:28,622 --> 00:17:33,168
Let's look at what you're doing as
an uncle from a therapeutic standpoint.

296
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:34,795
Charlie's been to the Pole.

297
00:17:34,878 --> 00:17:37,131
Your new baby's
being born at the Pole.

298
00:17:37,214 --> 00:17:40,008
Lucy's a member of
this family too, Scott.

299
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:44,346
And if you harshly exclude her
from this formative experience,

300
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,557
you could scar her for life.

301
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,892
And, consequently, her parents,

302
00:17:48,976 --> 00:17:52,229
who must accompany her
on long-distance journeys.

303
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:56,483
Please, Uncle Scott.

304
00:17:58,151 --> 00:18:00,487
Can I come to the North Pole, too?

305
00:18:05,826 --> 00:18:08,161
Please?

306
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,454
Oh, that's awfully good, isn't it?

307
00:18:51,955 --> 00:18:54,249
Guys, I've done it.

308
00:19:00,422 --> 00:19:03,342
What have you done?

309
00:19:03,425 --> 00:19:07,638
Is it going to clean itself up?
I don't think so. Quickly, quickly.

310
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:13,685
Curtis, I haven't seen
the bearded wonder around for a while.

311
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,229
- Where'd he go?
- None of your skis' wax.

312
00:19:16,313 --> 00:19:20,984
No need to be nippy. With all
the stress, I wouldn't blame the guy

313
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:24,029
- for doing that escape hatch thing.
- Escape Clause.

314
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:26,406
<i>Little elf woman, one cocoa, por favor.</i>

315
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:28,408
- Right away.
- Thank you.

316
00:19:28,492 --> 00:19:30,911
How does that Escape Clause work,
anyway?

317
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,705
Sorry, classified.
Elfland Security Act.

318
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:36,208
- That's just what I'd say.
- What?

319
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,960
If I didn't know anything.

320
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:42,547
Don't be embarrassed.
Makes perfect sense,

321
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:44,633
big guy would know important stuff.

322
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,260
For your information,
I'm elf number one.

323
00:19:47,344 --> 00:19:50,013
I know all there is
about the Hall of Snow Globes.

324
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:54,434
Everybody knows about the Hall
of Snow Globes. That's not special.

325
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:56,603
Not special?

326
00:19:58,397 --> 00:20:01,191
Not special?
It's the most top-secret,

327
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,777
hush-hush, amazing
place in the world.

328
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,948
It's where every Santa through history
has kept his personal snow globe.

329
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:10,951
How can you say that
that's not special?

330
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:12,244
Because it isn't.

331
00:20:12,327 --> 00:20:16,373
Unless you know what it has to do with
the Escape Clause, which you don't.

332
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:19,876
I bet Santa doesn't even trust you.

333
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:24,422
Now, you listen here, frostface.

334
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:28,552
Secret Santa snow globe.
Santa.

335
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,016
I wish that I had never
become Santa at all.

336
00:20:39,396 --> 00:20:41,189
Wait, wait, wait, what's this?

337
00:20:41,314 --> 00:20:43,859
This is where I'm transported
through time

338
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,444
and everything goes back
to the way it was,

339
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:49,364
like I'd never become Santa at all.

340
00:20:52,409 --> 00:20:54,286
Gets the snow globe,

341
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:57,080
puts his hands on it, says the words,

342
00:20:57,205 --> 00:20:59,040
and then whoosh!

343
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:00,917
Job opening: Santa Claus.

344
00:21:01,001 --> 00:21:02,586
Told you I know everything.

345
00:21:03,587 --> 00:21:04,838
Wow.

346
00:21:04,921 --> 00:21:09,259
I never dreamed I'd be so well-connected
to elves in high places.

347
00:21:09,342 --> 00:21:12,512
We really must party
in my condo in Gstaad sometime.

348
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:13,972
It'd be fun.

349
00:21:14,055 --> 00:21:18,184
Tell me, how do you get into
the Hall of Snow Globes, anyway?

350
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:21,021
Sorry, Jack. Now that's classified.

351
00:21:21,104 --> 00:21:22,606
I know that...

352
00:21:22,689 --> 00:21:24,691
...elf number one.

353
00:21:38,455 --> 00:21:41,249
- Did you bring the deep-dreamin' stuff?
- Got it.

354
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:45,921
It's important they sleep and dream
they're on a wonderful flight to Canada.

355
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:47,964
- I'm with the programme.
- Good.

356
00:21:48,048 --> 00:21:50,050
I may be sleepy, but I'm not stupid.

357
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,802
Yeah, well, take the hat off.

358
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:55,096
I get sniffly without my cap.

359
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,223
OK, OK.

360
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:58,725
All right, all right.

361
00:21:58,808 --> 00:22:01,227
Hey, Dad?

362
00:22:01,311 --> 00:22:04,314
Scott Calvin, as I live and breathe.

363
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,316
Good thing you called.

364
00:22:06,399 --> 00:22:09,736
Otherwise I don't know
if I would've remembered you.

365
00:22:09,819 --> 00:22:11,821
It's me, good old Scott Calvin.

366
00:22:11,905 --> 00:22:14,032
You look a little like Father Time.

367
00:22:14,115 --> 00:22:16,576
Doesn't look anything
like Father Time.

368
00:22:21,122 --> 00:22:23,875
Oh. That's a nice door.

369
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,503
Well, thank you. Yeah.
It was a little sticky,

370
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:28,171
but smooth as a baby's butt now.

371
00:22:28,254 --> 00:22:30,799
- Come, take a feel.
- Oh, why not, huh?

372
00:22:30,924 --> 00:22:32,384
Look at that.

373
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,844
Very butt-like.

374
00:22:34,928 --> 00:22:36,179
Who's your pal?

375
00:22:36,304 --> 00:22:39,891
Sandy. This is my associate.
He'll be taking us to the airport.

376
00:22:40,016 --> 00:22:43,603
- An associate? Business must be good.
- Busy as usual.

377
00:22:43,728 --> 00:22:47,565
So busy you can't bring our daughter
to visit her mother and father?

378
00:22:47,649 --> 00:22:49,192
Scott.

379
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:52,320
Oh, so nice to see you.

380
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,531
- You too, Sylvia.
- And your friend?

381
00:22:54,656 --> 00:22:56,866
- Sandy.
- Sandy.

382
00:22:56,991 --> 00:22:58,743
Nice to meet you.

383
00:22:58,868 --> 00:23:02,497
Do you know how excited
we were to get your phone call?

384
00:23:02,622 --> 00:23:06,126
See, we get so few,
and each one is special.

385
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:07,544
Oh, come on, you guys,

386
00:23:07,627 --> 00:23:09,546
you'll catch pneumonia out here.

387
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,216
It's so wonderful
to have you all here.

388
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,759
- Festive.
- Easy.

389
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:16,511
Please, please sit down.

390
00:23:16,594 --> 00:23:19,514
Oh, no, no, no. No.
We gotta get to the airport.

391
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:22,851
Kind of a hurry. Let's get
your bags and pop 'em in the car.

392
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,686
- I'm almost packed.
- Great!

393
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:30,024
Throw my underwear in a bag. It's not
like we're going to the North Pole.

394
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:31,901
- It's cold in Canada.
- Well...

395
00:23:31,985 --> 00:23:33,903
Remember when we went to Yosemite?

396
00:23:33,987 --> 00:23:35,738
Oh, here we go, Yosemite again.

397
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:38,366
It was freezing
and there were bears.

398
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,201
You never left the lodge.

399
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,579
Because it was freezing.

400
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:45,540
- And there were bears?
- Yes! And it was freezing.

401
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:49,085
- It was freezing weather?
- It was in the freezing weather.

402
00:23:49,169 --> 00:23:52,505
Let me understand.
You did not enjoy the trip to Yosemite?

403
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,424
- You heard me.
- I heard you.

404
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:11,191
What?

405
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:13,401
What part of our plan was not clear?

406
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:16,446
Let's put them to sleep
when they get into the car.

407
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:19,657
I couldn't stand to hear
the Yosemite story anymore.

408
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:23,036
OK. So let's figure how we'll
get in the car. We'll both...

409
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,871
Sandman, what are you doing?

410
00:24:28,041 --> 00:24:30,668
What? Sandman. Sandman!

411
00:24:32,879 --> 00:24:36,382
Great, I get to throw
his underwear in a bag.

412
00:25:01,407 --> 00:25:04,327
Hey, Mrs C. What you doing?

413
00:25:04,452 --> 00:25:06,329
Oh, hi, Jack.

414
00:25:06,454 --> 00:25:09,290
I'm trying to pick a tree
the whole family will love.

415
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,834
Ah, family.

416
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,380
You know, I cannot imagine
how hard it must be

417
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:18,132
keeping such a big secret
from your folks.

418
00:25:18,216 --> 00:25:20,760
Oh, you have no idea.

419
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:25,014
Tell me, Mrs Claus...

420
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:27,266
...being legendary by marriage,

421
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:30,895
do you ever find yourself wondering
if it's all really worth it?

422
00:25:32,897 --> 00:25:35,191
Well, it's definitely worth it.

423
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,239
I'm sure dropping your life,
schlepping all the way to the North Pole

424
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:43,574
- has been totally worthwhile.
- Yeah.

425
00:25:43,658 --> 00:25:46,911
Probably not one iota,
not even a scintilla, of regret?

426
00:25:46,994 --> 00:25:48,663
- Not one.
- Yeah.

427
00:25:48,746 --> 00:25:52,959
Look at that. Oh, dear.
A little sad, neglected maybe.

428
00:25:53,042 --> 00:25:55,169
Just needs a little tender loving care

429
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:58,715
that nobody's bothering to give,
don't you think?

430
00:26:02,051 --> 00:26:03,886
It's perfect.

431
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,931
I will give you all
the TLC that you need.

432
00:26:07,014 --> 00:26:09,058
Scott loves decorating the tree.

433
00:26:09,142 --> 00:26:12,812
He always insists on putting
the tree topper on himself.

434
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:15,398
Ho ho ho!

435
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:19,444
They're here!

436
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,655
This is so exciting.

437
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,974
I'm here! I cannot believe it!
I'm actually here!

438
00:26:50,057 --> 00:26:53,561
What a wonderful surprise.
I didn't know you were coming.

439
00:26:53,686 --> 00:26:56,063
- Uncle Scott brought me.
- Hey.

440
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:57,899
And we tagged along!

441
00:26:58,024 --> 00:27:00,568
Hey! Hey! Hi!

442
00:27:00,693 --> 00:27:03,529
Oh, it's tall people...
Not that you're not tall.

443
00:27:03,613 --> 00:27:04,864
Surprise!

444
00:27:04,989 --> 00:27:07,742
- Hello!
- Oh, you look wonderful.

445
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:10,077
- Really?
- You are glowing.

446
00:27:10,203 --> 00:27:13,706
- What did you think of my parents?
- They slept the entire trip.

447
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:16,500
This is amazing!
Can we see the workshop?

448
00:27:16,584 --> 00:27:18,252
Yes. Go right there.
Go ahead.

449
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:19,712
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

450
00:27:19,795 --> 00:27:23,925
My mom and dad can't know we're
at Santa's workshop in the North Pole.

451
00:27:24,008 --> 00:27:25,468
Where do they think we are?

452
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:27,011
Welcome to Canada!

453
00:27:28,554 --> 00:27:30,097
Eh?

454
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:34,018
An easy flight,
we cruised through customs.

455
00:27:34,101 --> 00:27:36,938
Oh, what a strange flight.

456
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,232
Go, go, go.

457
00:27:39,315 --> 00:27:41,400
It was like a dream.

458
00:27:43,277 --> 00:27:45,655
And such a nice meal.

459
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:47,240
They gave you a meal?

460
00:27:47,323 --> 00:27:49,450
I got four nuts in a pouch.

461
00:27:49,533 --> 00:27:51,744
And you had us sit in coach.

462
00:27:51,827 --> 00:27:54,497
No, that was first class.

463
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,416
And I got a chance to sit
next to Tony Bennett.

464
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,918
Mom! Dad!

465
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,796
Sweetheart! Sweetheart.

466
00:28:01,879 --> 00:28:03,798
- Come here.
- Oh, you!

467
00:28:03,881 --> 00:28:05,299
Look at you, look at you.

468
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:07,426
And look at this, look at this.

469
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,761
It could be twins.

470
00:28:08,844 --> 00:28:12,848
But since you married the toymaker,
we don't get a lot of information.

471
00:28:12,932 --> 00:28:15,059
Oh, honey, just stop it, OK?

472
00:28:15,142 --> 00:28:19,146
Sweetheart, I am just so happy
to see you, darling.

473
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,816
I'm so happy to see you, too, Mom.

474
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:24,151
I'm sure you have
a perfectly good reason

475
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,362
for shutting us out of your life.

476
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:42,253
Magnificent.

477
00:28:42,336 --> 00:28:44,088
It's amazing.

478
00:28:44,171 --> 00:28:45,965
Killer.

479
00:28:51,721 --> 00:28:54,265
Please remember,
you're welcome to observe,

480
00:28:54,348 --> 00:28:57,059
but don't touch
or interfere with toy-making.

481
00:28:57,143 --> 00:28:59,687
I'll make sure she
doesn't get into anything.

482
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,231
Look! Kobi the Magic Panda
and accessories!

483
00:29:02,356 --> 00:29:03,691
Lucy!

484
00:29:03,774 --> 00:29:05,901
Lucy, come back here.
Whoa!

485
00:29:05,985 --> 00:29:07,611
Trains.

486
00:29:07,695 --> 00:29:10,448
I'm... I'm just gonna go make a doll!

487
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,456
Oh, excellent job.

488
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:20,833
Bang, bang!

489
00:29:28,841 --> 00:29:30,134
Isn't that fun?

490
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:31,969
Faster, worker elves, faster.

491
00:29:38,476 --> 00:29:41,479
The Hall of Snow Globes, perhaps?

492
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:57,411
What might we have here.

493
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:02,750
It's a lot of beans.

494
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:04,793
How many beans can he eat?

495
00:30:05,878 --> 00:30:07,671
Who are you?

496
00:30:07,755 --> 00:30:09,256
Who are you?

497
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,051
You don't resemble
one of the red man's minions.

498
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:15,262
- What's the deal?
- I'm Lucy. Scott's my uncle.

499
00:30:15,346 --> 00:30:18,265
Ohh. I'm Frost.

500
00:30:18,349 --> 00:30:20,601
- Jack Frost.
- Who?

501
00:30:20,684 --> 00:30:25,105
Jack Frost.
You know, the Jack Frost?

502
00:30:25,189 --> 00:30:27,691
Never heard of you.

503
00:30:29,735 --> 00:30:31,862
Jack Frost.

504
00:30:31,946 --> 00:30:34,114
Legendary figure. Ring a bell?

505
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:36,659
No. But I know about Tooth Fairy

506
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:38,661
and Sandman and the Easter Bunny.

507
00:30:38,744 --> 00:30:43,040
You got to know about me, I'm
a legendary figure, with enormous power.

508
00:30:43,123 --> 00:30:46,710
- OK, OK, chill.
- I invented chill!

509
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:49,922
Sorry.

510
00:30:50,005 --> 00:30:51,590
Hey...

511
00:30:51,674 --> 00:30:53,968
How would you like to be
one of my elves?

512
00:30:54,051 --> 00:30:55,719
No.

513
00:30:56,929 --> 00:30:58,389
Hey, Mom?

514
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:01,350
No.

515
00:31:01,433 --> 00:31:03,811
What a quaint little village.

516
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,605
Everybody's just so petite.

517
00:31:06,689 --> 00:31:10,109
No. Tom Cruise is petite.
These people are short.

518
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:13,862
- What's the deal with them?
- Who? What?

519
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:16,115
Oh...

520
00:31:17,241 --> 00:31:18,867
Have you ever been to Canada?

521
00:31:18,951 --> 00:31:20,661
No. It's too far.

522
00:31:20,744 --> 00:31:23,956
We did go to Rochester, New York, once,
to visit her sister.

523
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:27,543
Very lovely place.
But it's not Canada, is it?

524
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:28,711
No.

525
00:31:28,836 --> 00:31:31,088
Well, this is...

526
00:31:32,172 --> 00:31:34,258
This is what Canadians look like.

527
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:45,728
And stretch.

528
00:31:45,811 --> 00:31:48,188
Stretch.

529
00:31:48,272 --> 00:31:50,983
Let all those packages go.

530
00:31:51,066 --> 00:31:54,445
Know that you're enough.

531
00:31:54,528 --> 00:31:56,488
And breathe.

532
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,122
Very good.

533
00:32:05,205 --> 00:32:09,251
Don't forget you can do this on your own
whenever you get stressed out.

534
00:32:09,334 --> 00:32:11,211
I won't always be here
to help you.

535
00:32:11,295 --> 00:32:15,299
Stress can reduce your life
by hundreds of years.

536
00:32:15,382 --> 00:32:17,092
Hundreds.

537
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:19,470
You take Christmas very seriously.

538
00:32:19,553 --> 00:32:22,055
- It's the most wonderful time of year.
- Yeah!

539
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:24,808
Honey, just because
you're not into Christmas

540
00:32:24,892 --> 00:32:27,311
doesn't mean others can't enjoy it.

541
00:32:27,394 --> 00:32:32,107
Kids won't enjoy their toys this year.
This should've been in stores weeks ago.

542
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:35,778
Oh. No worries. We have a unique
distribution system here.

543
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:39,823
In order to distribute this stuff
you're gonna have to freeze time.

544
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:43,202
Manipulating the space-time continuum

545
00:32:43,285 --> 00:32:46,121
for one-night global delivery
is the easy part.

546
00:32:46,205 --> 00:32:48,373
Who are you?

547
00:32:49,249 --> 00:32:50,584
Curtis.

548
00:32:51,835 --> 00:32:52,920
Eh?

549
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,215
- Who's hungry?
- Hey, guys, how you doing?

550
00:32:56,215 --> 00:32:59,134
- Who's hungry?
- Hey, guys, how you doing?

551
00:32:59,218 --> 00:33:01,178
Come here. Got some exciting news.

552
00:33:01,261 --> 00:33:04,223
Will put a little spring
into your elfin step.

553
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:07,476
Santa says he really
wants you to take a break.

554
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,020
So there's a delicious vat

555
00:33:10,145 --> 00:33:13,148
of steaming hot cocoa in the lounge

556
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:15,984
with your little names on it.

557
00:33:18,195 --> 00:33:20,614
Oh, it's a tantalising blend

558
00:33:20,739 --> 00:33:22,950
of full, rich cocoa

559
00:33:23,075 --> 00:33:25,536
with just a suggestion...

560
00:33:25,661 --> 00:33:27,871
...of vanilla.

561
00:33:29,581 --> 00:33:31,750
Get in there and try some, won't you?

562
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,418
It's got your names on it.

563
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,837
Enjoy.

564
00:33:58,694 --> 00:34:01,697
A sumptuous blend of Gold Coast
and Spanish cocoas.

565
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,908
Sweet to the palate,
but, oh, so warm to the tummy.

566
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,577
With a trickle of cinnamon
and orange essence,

567
00:34:07,661 --> 00:34:10,956
enough to drive
the taste buds mad!

568
00:34:12,916 --> 00:34:14,918
Go on.

569
00:34:34,396 --> 00:34:36,982
Look at this kitchen! Oh!

570
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:39,401
Look at the size of that oven.

571
00:34:39,484 --> 00:34:42,404
You could cook
a woolly mammoth in there.

572
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:45,532
- Let's have something to eat.
- You got some operation.

573
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:47,993
You've been holding out.
Why the secrecy?

574
00:34:48,076 --> 00:34:50,787
There's no secrets. We're family.

575
00:34:50,871 --> 00:34:54,958
Heavens sakes, you must be the in-laws.
So very pleased to meet you.

576
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:57,335
Hi.

577
00:34:57,419 --> 00:34:59,796
- Bud, Sylvia, this is...
- Jack Frost.

578
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:04,217
Not Jack Frost. He's playing Jack Frost
in our "Yippee, it's Canada!" parade.

579
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,552
Oh, yes, of course.

580
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:08,305
To bring frosty cheer
to the workers.

581
00:35:08,388 --> 00:35:11,558
I'm kind of like the team mascot, eh?

582
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,603
Who does your hair?

583
00:35:14,686 --> 00:35:17,647
You like it? It's... I freeze-dry it.

584
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,442
Sir, can I borrow you?

585
00:35:21,651 --> 00:35:23,361
Yeah. Excuse me just a minute.

586
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,952
We have a small paperwork problem.

587
00:35:31,077 --> 00:35:34,331
Go ahead. I'll make sure
everyone's as happy as a lark.

588
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:36,833
For that's why I'm here, eh?

589
00:35:36,958 --> 00:35:40,128
Cocoacchinos, anyone?

590
00:35:40,253 --> 00:35:44,466
- What's going on? What's going on?
- We're still trying to assess here.

591
00:35:46,134 --> 00:35:48,011
Somebody get me out of here.

592
00:35:48,094 --> 00:35:52,140
We've got a cache failure in the
motherboard. You gotta get a rerouter.

593
00:35:52,224 --> 00:35:54,351
- You need a solder gun...
- I can't see!

594
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:56,770
You need some scissors here.

595
00:35:57,771 --> 00:35:59,981
I'm off to help electrics.

596
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,961
Kitchen this size,
I can't find a sandwich.

597
00:36:21,044 --> 00:36:22,921
Oh, let me help you there.

598
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:25,840
For heaven... How does
something like that happen?

599
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:27,926
Oh, dear.

600
00:36:35,141 --> 00:36:39,896
- Cocoacchinos, anyone?
- Oh. Yes.

601
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,731
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

602
00:36:41,815 --> 00:36:43,650
Let me get you
this chair here.

603
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:46,736
There we go.
Isn't that lovely?

604
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:49,281
And here you go.
I hope you like it.

605
00:36:49,364 --> 00:36:51,741
- Oh, my.
- It's my own recipe.

606
00:36:51,825 --> 00:36:53,952
Yes.

607
00:36:55,537 --> 00:36:57,455
Minty.

608
00:36:57,539 --> 00:36:59,457
Doesn't it make you feel fresh?

609
00:36:59,541 --> 00:37:02,752
Oh, yes, it does.

610
00:37:02,836 --> 00:37:06,298
Oh, my, I just... I love your hair.

611
00:37:06,381 --> 00:37:07,966
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

612
00:37:08,049 --> 00:37:10,969
- I love yours.
- Really?

613
00:37:11,052 --> 00:37:14,723
- I've never seen anything like that.
- Oh, you're so adorable.

614
00:37:14,848 --> 00:37:17,976
You divine little kitten, you.

615
00:37:19,227 --> 00:37:22,147
- And I bet you sing, too.
- No, no, no, no. No.

616
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:23,773
Go on. I bet you can sing.

617
00:37:23,898 --> 00:37:26,651
- Maybe a little bit.
- I knew it, I knew it.

618
00:37:26,776 --> 00:37:29,779
- Sing something.
- What would you like to hear?

619
00:37:29,863 --> 00:37:31,239
How about...

620
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:42,167
Oh, I love it.

621
00:37:45,712 --> 00:37:48,590
No, no, go back to
the other line, the part before...

622
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,597
Oh, it gives me chills.

623
00:38:00,727 --> 00:38:02,020
Oh, what a lyric.

624
00:38:02,103 --> 00:38:05,190
- What's going on over here?
- Your mother is fabulous!

625
00:38:07,358 --> 00:38:09,194
Would you like to be my elf?

626
00:38:10,612 --> 00:38:11,696
You heard me.

627
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:15,408
Heads up! Heads up!
Coming through!

628
00:38:15,492 --> 00:38:18,828
- Fire!
- Back off! Back off!

629
00:38:18,912 --> 00:38:20,997
Back off!

630
00:38:21,081 --> 00:38:24,084
We got a dangerous situation.
Back off!

631
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:28,505
Back off! Don't breathe.
Don't breathe in.

632
00:38:32,175 --> 00:38:35,929
What's wrong with you people?
We were an inch away from Armageddon.

633
00:38:36,012 --> 00:38:38,765
- I'll get a mop.
- Oh, Dad, you did great.

634
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,642
- You all right?
- Had to be done.

635
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:43,353
- That was wonderful, honey.
- Hi, everyone.

636
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:46,022
- Oh, my!
- You're awake!

637
00:38:46,106 --> 00:38:48,900
Awake, yeah. Who are you?

638
00:38:48,983 --> 00:38:52,904
Oh. Mom and Dad, this is Scott's
ex-wife Laura and her husband Neil.

639
00:38:52,987 --> 00:38:54,614
- Hi.
- Their daughter, Lucy.

640
00:38:54,697 --> 00:38:56,741
Hi.

641
00:38:56,825 --> 00:39:00,203
They came to join us
for Christmas. Isn't that nice?

642
00:39:02,372 --> 00:39:04,707
If Scott is that close to his ex-wife,

643
00:39:04,791 --> 00:39:08,378
and you don't find that
incredibly threatening,

644
00:39:08,461 --> 00:39:10,797
I'm sure it's very nice.

645
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,758
Hi, everybody, I'm back.

646
00:39:16,594 --> 00:39:17,971
Hey, what happened?

647
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:22,141
You didn't tell your in-laws your
ex-wife is spending Christmas with you.

648
00:39:22,225 --> 00:39:24,102
More secrets.

649
00:39:30,942 --> 00:39:32,485
Nothing works in this joint.

650
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,530
Think this is something?
See the delivery room.

651
00:39:35,655 --> 00:39:36,865
Is there a problem?

652
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:38,992
I want to see the delivery room.

653
00:39:39,117 --> 00:39:40,410
What?

654
00:39:42,495 --> 00:39:45,832
- Heavy load! Coming through!
- Watch your backs, people.

655
00:39:45,957 --> 00:39:47,625
Set it down there.

656
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,712
This is the delivery room?
This is not a delivery room.

657
00:39:50,795 --> 00:39:52,797
This is a disaster. What's going on?

658
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,800
We're remodelling.
It'll be huge, comfortable.

659
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:59,012
This is a broom closet.
The oven in the kitchen's bigger.

660
00:39:59,095 --> 00:40:02,140
This isn't a broom closet...
Watch your back again!

661
00:40:02,223 --> 00:40:05,977
There we go. This is the hospital
for the entire toy factory.

662
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,270
How about that, Syl?

663
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:11,357
Our grandchild is being born in a
broom closet of a Canadian toy factory.

664
00:40:11,441 --> 00:40:16,154
You can be honest with us. Don't be
afraid. Are you held against your will?

665
00:40:16,237 --> 00:40:19,449
- Is there even a doctor here?
- Yes, there's a doctor...

666
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:22,785
Hello! I'm Dr Hismus.
Pleasure to meet you, eh?

667
00:40:22,869 --> 00:40:25,204
- This is the doctor?
- Very good doctor.

668
00:40:25,288 --> 00:40:28,082
- I see.
- Watch your backs. Excuse me.

669
00:40:28,166 --> 00:40:31,002
What are we supposed to do
with the wood in here?

670
00:40:31,085 --> 00:40:33,629
- Why do we have wood in here?
- I'm taking over.

671
00:40:33,713 --> 00:40:36,215
Don't be silly.
Let the tiny Canadians do it.

672
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:38,343
Somebody get me an apron
and a hammer.

673
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:40,470
Get him an apron and hammer.

674
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:44,682
<i>- What's happening?
- Emergency in the toy factory.</i>

675
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:48,686
- I'll be back in two minutes.
- OK, let's go to work.

676
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,732
I got this one.

677
00:40:52,815 --> 00:40:54,776
There it is! I got it!

678
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:59,155
Look out, coming through. I got it.

679
00:40:59,238 --> 00:41:01,949
Go. Boy, these bears...
We gotta make 'em stop.

680
00:41:02,033 --> 00:41:05,745
It's a great way to put out an eye.
Shut this place down!

681
00:41:05,828 --> 00:41:07,622
Hey, cut it off, cut it off.

682
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:09,874
Right there's the start. Cut it off.

683
00:41:12,835 --> 00:41:14,796
Where are the fire elves?

684
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:18,091
Help. Give me an aisle. Come on.

685
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:21,427
- Let the professionals at it.
- Hit the base of the flame.

686
00:41:30,645 --> 00:41:32,271
Sir, sir!

687
00:41:33,356 --> 00:41:37,110
Curtis, stop. If you're gonna
tell me our entire facility is in ruin,

688
00:41:37,235 --> 00:41:40,154
Christmas is tomorrow,
for the first time in history

689
00:41:40,238 --> 00:41:44,283
kids of the world won't get what they
asked for because I failed, stop it.

690
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:47,161
I can't stand one more
piece of bad news.

691
00:41:47,286 --> 00:41:49,080
- Then good news, sir.
- What?

692
00:41:49,205 --> 00:41:51,415
Your pants are on fire.

693
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,292
Fire in the hole!

694
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,419
- Captain.
- I'm on it, Curtis.

695
00:42:04,345 --> 00:42:07,265
Oh, my. Is there anything I can do?

696
00:42:07,348 --> 00:42:09,475
Put a chill on my bottom for me?

697
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:14,105
Go to the naughty and nice area,
help the elves clean up.

698
00:42:14,188 --> 00:42:16,399
- Go! Move, move!
- Quickly, move it!

699
00:42:16,482 --> 00:42:18,818
- Stop lollygagging!
- Status report.

700
00:42:18,901 --> 00:42:20,820
Springs on the pogo sticks melted.

701
00:42:20,903 --> 00:42:25,283
Let me see, let me see. I like that toy.
Glenda. Give me a status report.

702
00:42:25,366 --> 00:42:28,369
- Legs on the ironing board burned up.
- Let me see.

703
00:42:30,204 --> 00:42:32,665
Only the wheels are left
on the wooden truck.

704
00:42:32,748 --> 00:42:34,542
That was my favourite.

705
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,380
The rockets are in pieces,
but the launch motors are intact, sir.

706
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:42,049
Launch motors intact?
Get over here.

707
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,634
I think I got an idea.

708
00:43:08,951 --> 00:43:10,786
Jet-powered scooter board.

709
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:13,623
Way to go, Santa!

710
00:43:15,541 --> 00:43:17,793
That's how the men in red
get things done.

711
00:43:17,877 --> 00:43:20,338
We got a schedule to keep,
get back to work.

712
00:43:20,421 --> 00:43:22,548
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

713
00:43:22,632 --> 00:43:26,344
Whoa. You're just amazing.

714
00:43:26,427 --> 00:43:29,513
Can't keep a good Santa down, huh?

715
00:43:31,057 --> 00:43:33,768
So, doesn't anything bother you?

716
00:43:33,851 --> 00:43:35,728
You don't sweat the small stuff.

717
00:43:35,853 --> 00:43:39,607
Problem at work, that's a challenge.
Problem at home, a problem.

718
00:43:41,442 --> 00:43:44,862
Uncle Scott, that was the most
amazing thing I've ever seen.

719
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:49,075
Wait a minute.
You weren't worried, were you?

720
00:43:49,158 --> 00:43:51,577
- Not for a second.
- Neither was I.

721
00:43:51,702 --> 00:43:54,914
Uncle Scott, you know
what I've been dying to see?

722
00:43:55,039 --> 00:43:56,040
No.

723
00:43:56,165 --> 00:43:57,875
Your snow globe collection.

724
00:43:59,543 --> 00:44:01,921
You can see it,
if you can catch me.

725
00:44:02,838 --> 00:44:04,423
Watch out, coming through.

726
00:44:04,507 --> 00:44:06,634
Last one up is a glazed ham!

727
00:44:19,522 --> 00:44:22,525
Don't watch what I'm doing,
this is a very secret code.

728
00:44:22,608 --> 00:44:25,694
- Oh, come on, Uncle Scott.
- It is.

729
00:44:28,656 --> 00:44:29,990
Very secret.

730
00:44:35,162 --> 00:44:36,330
Watch what happens.

731
00:44:37,790 --> 00:44:39,917
Look out, look out!

732
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:12,158
Whoa.

733
00:45:13,534 --> 00:45:15,452
Where are we?

734
00:45:15,536 --> 00:45:18,789
I told you I have an amazing collection
of snow globes.

735
00:45:18,873 --> 00:45:21,542
This is the Hall of Snow Globes.

736
00:45:23,627 --> 00:45:25,129
Go on in.

737
00:45:29,508 --> 00:45:33,262
This is so beautiful, Uncle Scott.

738
00:45:35,973 --> 00:45:40,102
These are all the snow globes for
all the Santas that have ever been.

739
00:45:40,185 --> 00:45:41,687
And this one...

740
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:43,355
...that one's mine.

741
00:45:43,439 --> 00:45:46,275
It's my very favourite,
just like you gave Charlie.

742
00:45:46,358 --> 00:45:48,319
Yeah. You know,

743
00:45:48,444 --> 00:45:50,654
I'm kind of partial to this one myself.

744
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:52,239
Look, it's snowin'.

745
00:45:55,367 --> 00:45:57,953
Yeah. You got a good collection.

746
00:45:58,078 --> 00:46:00,539
Too bad you don't have one like this.

747
00:46:01,999 --> 00:46:05,294
- It's... It's me.
- Yeah.

748
00:46:07,796 --> 00:46:09,798
Hugging a snowman.

749
00:46:13,052 --> 00:46:15,638
Oh! And he turns pink!

750
00:46:15,721 --> 00:46:18,974
I told you your warm hugs were magical.

751
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:21,352
Thank you for my present, Santa.

752
00:46:21,435 --> 00:46:23,938
It's OK.

753
00:46:25,064 --> 00:46:26,774
Well, look at it this way.

754
00:46:26,857 --> 00:46:29,777
One down, 2.6 billion to go.

755
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:32,488
We better get out of here.

756
00:46:32,571 --> 00:46:34,239
Hold on, here we go.

757
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:19,201
Do you want me
to put on the tree topper?

758
00:47:19,284 --> 00:47:22,121
Save it for Scott.
He always puts the tree topper on.

759
00:47:22,204 --> 00:47:24,665
Of course.

760
00:47:26,583 --> 00:47:29,253
It's strange how much

761
00:47:29,336 --> 00:47:31,672
this resembles...

762
00:47:36,218 --> 00:47:39,138
- Hi, honey, I'm back.
- Oh, honey, are you OK?

763
00:47:39,221 --> 00:47:42,307
Great. Good news is
I get to spend time with you guys.

764
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,268
Scott.

765
00:47:44,351 --> 00:47:45,853
Sir.

766
00:47:45,936 --> 00:47:47,438
Sorry to interrupt.

767
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:52,443
There's something
you need to check twice.

768
00:47:55,279 --> 00:47:56,280
Two minutes?

769
00:48:00,451 --> 00:48:03,537
What? What?

770
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:10,252
We have a problem. This is unreadable.
Because it's all crinkled up.

771
00:48:10,377 --> 00:48:13,297
You gotta plan it out.
It's gotta be in my office.

772
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:15,507
Yeah, my office.

773
00:48:15,591 --> 00:48:17,551
- Neil?
- What?

774
00:48:17,634 --> 00:48:20,637
Let's go find Lucy,
get her washed up for dinner, OK?

775
00:48:20,721 --> 00:48:22,598
Leave that here.
Leave it.

776
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:24,808
We'll be right back.

777
00:48:30,147 --> 00:48:31,607
Don't worry, honey.

778
00:48:32,774 --> 00:48:34,109
That's not gonna work.

779
00:48:34,193 --> 00:48:36,236
It's busy season.

780
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,697
It's always his busy season.

781
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:53,128
That's Uncle Scott's snow globe.
You're not supposed to have that.

782
00:48:53,212 --> 00:48:56,757
- I know. Isn't it great?
- It's not great at all.

783
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,719
You've done a terrible thing.
You'll be on the naughty list for life.

784
00:49:00,802 --> 00:49:03,180
But naughty list people have more fun.

785
00:49:03,263 --> 00:49:06,850
- I'm going for help.
- I wouldn't do that.

786
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,063
Mom, Dad! Over here, quick!

787
00:49:11,146 --> 00:49:12,481
- Lucy!
- What?

788
00:49:14,191 --> 00:49:16,193
- Come on, hurry!
- What's wrong?

789
00:49:18,362 --> 00:49:19,404
What's wrong?

790
00:49:20,405 --> 00:49:22,157
Sweetheart, what is it?

791
00:49:23,158 --> 00:49:25,577
I told you not to do that.

792
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:29,790
Jack Frost took Uncle Scott's snow globe
and he knows that it's not his.

793
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:34,878
Stop!

794
00:49:37,047 --> 00:49:38,256
Stop!

795
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:43,261
Don't! What did you do?

796
00:49:43,345 --> 00:49:45,013
I froze them.

797
00:49:48,141 --> 00:49:51,561
Now, am I gonna have to do
the same thing to you?

798
00:49:51,687 --> 00:49:57,025
Or are you going to get in that closet
and stay there without saying a word?

799
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:06,952
Smart girl.

800
00:50:09,705 --> 00:50:12,624
Oh, smile, will you?

801
00:50:12,749 --> 00:50:16,044
I've had kids beg me
to freeze their parents.

802
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:21,883
And to think I asked you to be my elf.

803
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:26,346
Of course all those bears
are machine-washable.

804
00:50:26,430 --> 00:50:29,808
Right. Just put it on the card.
I can't be in two places at once.

805
00:50:29,891 --> 00:50:33,770
You gotta manage and stop
calling every time something goes wrong.

806
00:50:33,854 --> 00:50:36,231
I'm a little busy
with my family, Curtis.

807
00:50:36,314 --> 00:50:39,568
All I want to see is
busy, busy worker tushies.

808
00:50:39,651 --> 00:50:41,570
Hey, hey,
I'm rolling downhill.

809
00:50:41,653 --> 00:50:43,697
This is not up to code,
this building.

810
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,574
You're number one. Act like it.

811
00:50:45,657 --> 00:50:47,993
Why haven't you put
the tree topper on yet?

812
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:50,036
Scott's just been a little busy.

813
00:50:52,747 --> 00:50:54,749
Tell your dad to do it.

814
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:58,879
And then watch the suddenly displaced
Mr Claus run right over.

815
00:50:58,962 --> 00:51:00,547
Go ahead. It'll be fun.

816
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:03,175
Dad, do you wanna help me
with the tree topper?

817
00:51:03,258 --> 00:51:04,801
Yeah, in a minute.

818
00:51:08,013 --> 00:51:09,931
I don't know who he is anymore.

819
00:51:10,015 --> 00:51:11,933
I don't know who he is, either.

820
00:51:12,017 --> 00:51:14,644
Neil, Lucy and Laura
should be here for this.

821
00:51:14,728 --> 00:51:16,730
They left a while ago.

822
00:51:16,813 --> 00:51:19,274
Some Canadians invited them
over for cocoa.

823
00:51:19,357 --> 00:51:22,277
You know how they are.
Yak-yak, yak-yak, eh?

824
00:51:23,278 --> 00:51:26,823
Scott? Tree topper, what do you say?

825
00:51:26,907 --> 00:51:29,868
Scott, honey,
let's put the tree topper on.

826
00:51:29,951 --> 00:51:33,496
- We can make a toast.
- You built this place on a fault line.

827
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,375
Millions of kids in Australia go
without gifts. What can I do for you?

828
00:51:37,459 --> 00:51:40,712
- Tree topper.
- Oh, yeah, tree topper. Good.

829
00:51:40,795 --> 00:51:42,047
Scott? Toast.

830
00:51:43,632 --> 00:51:44,758
Just a second.

831
00:51:46,718 --> 00:51:48,303
Good.

832
00:51:48,386 --> 00:51:51,765
Bad. Well, good for goodness sakes.

833
00:51:51,848 --> 00:51:55,143
Yeah. Uh-huh.
Curtis, I can't talk right now,

834
00:51:55,227 --> 00:51:58,563
I'm putting the tree topper on.
It's important. Can't talk.

835
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:00,649
Curtis, please, please, I gotta go.

836
00:52:00,774 --> 00:52:01,942
Bye.

837
00:52:05,487 --> 00:52:08,323
Gonna put it in my pocket.
I'm not answering that.

838
00:52:08,448 --> 00:52:12,035
I'm putting the phone in my pocket.
Put it in my pocket. All done.

839
00:52:12,118 --> 00:52:16,039
OK, everybody, as I climb up
this beautiful tree,

840
00:52:16,164 --> 00:52:18,667
I know we've had our ups and downs.

841
00:52:18,792 --> 00:52:21,127
But as I place this tree topper

842
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:22,921
in the traditional place,

843
00:52:23,046 --> 00:52:25,006
I just want to say...

844
00:52:49,114 --> 00:52:51,032
Be careful, honey.

845
00:53:11,302 --> 00:53:13,680
Oh, honey.

846
00:53:14,931 --> 00:53:17,976
Honey... I think maybe I can fix that.

847
00:53:19,436 --> 00:53:20,687
I know you're upset.

848
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:22,689
You picked up on that, did you?

849
00:53:22,772 --> 00:53:26,317
Bud, what is that supposed to mean?

850
00:53:26,401 --> 00:53:28,987
If you weren't working
all the time you'd know.

851
00:53:29,070 --> 00:53:31,614
You don't understand
the pressure I'm under.

852
00:53:31,698 --> 00:53:35,285
Well, maybe it's not as bad
as being ripped away from your family

853
00:53:35,368 --> 00:53:37,787
- and told you can't see them anymore.
- Dad.

854
00:53:37,871 --> 00:53:40,707
Maybe I invited you here
so Carol can be surrounded

855
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:44,711
by family for love and support while
I do things you can't even imagine.

856
00:53:44,794 --> 00:53:47,964
Rather than make things work,
you make things worse.

857
00:53:48,047 --> 00:53:49,382
We're leaving.

858
00:53:49,466 --> 00:53:52,552
- What?
- Maybe we shouldn't have come.

859
00:53:54,596 --> 00:53:57,223
Maybe you're right.
You shouldn't have come.

860
00:53:58,475 --> 00:54:01,269
Maybe I should never have come either.

861
00:54:01,352 --> 00:54:03,897
Don't say anything you'll regret.

862
00:54:05,148 --> 00:54:08,318
I think we all need
to cool down for a second.

863
00:54:11,696 --> 00:54:13,573
Why don't you and I take a walk?

864
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:15,575
Let's go. Let's just go.

865
00:54:19,996 --> 00:54:21,873
Oh, sweetheart.

866
00:54:49,901 --> 00:54:51,528
It's over.

867
00:54:51,611 --> 00:54:57,242
I thought I had a second chance
at having a family, but I blew it again.

868
00:54:58,117 --> 00:55:01,913
Hey. There's no one I know who could
hold this all together but you.

869
00:55:01,996 --> 00:55:03,331
But I didn't.

870
00:55:04,499 --> 00:55:07,710
My in-laws resent me,
Christmas is a disaster,

871
00:55:07,794 --> 00:55:10,713
and my pregnant wife wishes
that she never had met me.

872
00:55:12,173 --> 00:55:15,051
I was gonna wait until tomorrow
to give you this,

873
00:55:15,134 --> 00:55:16,636
but...

874
00:55:16,719 --> 00:55:20,139
I think you need
a bit of a pick-me-up now.

875
00:55:20,223 --> 00:55:22,267
- I can't.
- Come on. Open it.

876
00:55:22,350 --> 00:55:25,311
- I don't feel like it.
- It'll make you feel better.

877
00:55:25,395 --> 00:55:29,816
- I don't feel like it.
- Come on, open it, please.

878
00:55:29,899 --> 00:55:31,776
Thanks.

879
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:36,656
So are there times when you wonder...

880
00:55:38,866 --> 00:55:40,118
Wonder what?

881
00:55:40,201 --> 00:55:42,954
- If this was even...
- Worth it?

882
00:55:43,037 --> 00:55:46,165
More than you know.

883
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,044
Tonight's one of these times, huh?

884
00:55:50,128 --> 00:55:52,422
Wish I'd never put that red coat on.

885
00:55:52,505 --> 00:55:56,134
So... you wish you'd
never become Santa at all?

886
00:55:56,217 --> 00:55:59,220
I wish I'd never become Santa.

887
00:56:00,221 --> 00:56:01,431
At all?

888
00:56:03,266 --> 00:56:05,727
At all. At all.

889
00:56:05,810 --> 00:56:07,770
Yeah, at all.

890
00:56:09,063 --> 00:56:12,233
I wished I'd never been
Santa at all. Happy?

891
00:56:13,818 --> 00:56:15,361
I am now.

892
00:56:18,906 --> 00:56:20,867
No!

893
00:56:37,675 --> 00:56:39,594
Ho ho ho.

894
00:56:45,266 --> 00:56:46,517
Hey, you!

895
00:56:46,601 --> 00:56:48,978
Ho ho... Uh-oh!

896
00:57:00,698 --> 00:57:02,575
Get off me, blubber ball!

897
00:57:02,658 --> 00:57:04,619
I will not let you put on that coat!

898
00:57:04,702 --> 00:57:05,995
Oh, yeah? Watch me!

899
00:57:06,078 --> 00:57:08,164
Don't even think about it, Jack.

900
00:57:18,674 --> 00:57:21,260
You hit me with a shovel!

901
00:57:25,014 --> 00:57:26,933
Adios, fatty!

902
00:57:27,808 --> 00:57:30,144
No, Frost, no!

903
00:57:31,812 --> 00:57:33,856
Oh, no.

904
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:53,834
OK, so, the Mississippi
factory needs to know

905
00:57:53,918 --> 00:57:57,630
if we want them to ship
100,000 units or 200,000.

906
00:57:57,713 --> 00:58:00,550
They won't ship tomorrow
because it's Christmas,

907
00:58:00,633 --> 00:58:03,636
but they will ship Thursday,
which means...

908
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:06,722
- They're not gonna ship tomorrow?
- Yes, sir.

909
00:58:06,806 --> 00:58:10,017
- This is Christmas Eve?
- Yes, sir.

910
00:58:10,977 --> 00:58:13,104
What are you doing?
Why are we working?

911
00:58:13,187 --> 00:58:14,897
We always work Christmas Eve.

912
00:58:16,107 --> 00:58:17,692
- We do?
- Of course.

913
00:58:17,775 --> 00:58:20,069
Well, that... that's ridiculous.

914
00:58:20,194 --> 00:58:23,364
Christmas Eve is when you
spend time with your family.

915
00:58:23,447 --> 00:58:27,994
- Where's my family tonight?
- I really don't know, Mr Calvin.

916
00:58:28,077 --> 00:58:29,620
What do you mean?

917
00:58:29,745 --> 00:58:31,122
Well, you rarely see them

918
00:58:31,247 --> 00:58:34,875
and you... don't mention them.

919
00:58:37,253 --> 00:58:38,713
Where are my car keys?

920
00:58:49,432 --> 00:58:50,933
Hey.

921
00:58:51,017 --> 00:58:53,102
What are you doing here?

922
00:58:53,185 --> 00:58:55,771
Well, I just came over to see...

923
00:58:55,855 --> 00:59:00,651
See what? Why on earth would you
drag yourself all the way over here?

924
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,154
- Is that Derek?
- No.

925
00:59:03,237 --> 00:59:06,073
- And you're not going out tonight.
- Yeah, OK.

926
00:59:06,574 --> 00:59:10,077
- What are you doing here?
- Came over to see you.

927
00:59:11,078 --> 00:59:12,204
Why?

928
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:16,042
Cause we don't see
each other enough.

929
00:59:17,626 --> 00:59:19,712
- What?
- Come on, Charlie.

930
00:59:19,795 --> 00:59:21,047
I'm outta here.

931
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:24,717
- Charlie, it's Christmas Eve.
- Like either of us care, Mom?

932
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,385
- Charlie.
- What?

933
00:59:26,469 --> 00:59:28,387
Come back here. Charlie!

934
00:59:28,471 --> 00:59:31,015
- Good night, Scott.
- Wait, wait!

935
00:59:32,141 --> 00:59:34,560
Can you help me find Carol?

936
00:59:34,643 --> 00:59:36,562
- Carol?
- Carol Newman.

937
00:59:37,772 --> 00:59:40,649
Carol Newman, the principal
of Charlie's school?

938
00:59:40,733 --> 00:59:44,528
- Yeah. Do you know where she is?
- I don't know. She moved away.

939
00:59:44,612 --> 00:59:47,990
Ran out of local kids to terrify,
I guess. I don't know.

940
00:59:48,074 --> 00:59:49,700
What is the matter with you?

941
00:59:49,784 --> 00:59:52,787
Neil. Neil and Lucy,
they'll understand.

942
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:56,207
- Where are they?
- At the North Pole.

943
00:59:56,290 --> 00:59:57,708
At the North Pole?

944
01:00:02,087 --> 01:00:04,840
Yeah. The North Pole.

945
01:00:05,466 --> 01:00:07,885
- Frost.
- What?

946
01:00:07,968 --> 01:00:10,763
Frost turned the North Pole
into a theme park.

947
01:00:11,889 --> 01:00:14,308
Neil has been taking Lucy
to the North Pole

948
01:00:14,391 --> 01:00:16,644
ever since he and I got our divorce.

949
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:19,647
Divorce?

950
01:00:21,649 --> 01:00:23,776
Are you sure you should be driving?

951
01:00:25,069 --> 01:00:28,572
I'm gonna make everything OK.
I'll make everything better.

952
01:00:30,157 --> 01:00:32,034
Yeah. OK.

953
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:42,938
Get a ticket. We were here first.

954
01:01:45,524 --> 01:01:47,109
I hate it. I'm not getting on.

955
01:01:47,192 --> 01:01:50,154
- I'm not made of money, all right?
- Let's go.

956
01:01:50,237 --> 01:01:54,116
<i>Try our gingerbread houses.
They're Santalicious.</i>

957
01:01:56,869 --> 01:01:59,538
<i>Don't forget to buy
a ticket for Santa's show.</i>

958
01:02:00,873 --> 01:02:03,208
Do I look like
a cash machine to you?

959
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:05,627
I want a dancing Santa!

960
01:02:09,256 --> 01:02:10,883
Keep moving. Come on.

961
01:02:10,966 --> 01:02:13,385
Forget it, that's it.

962
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:16,472
- I saw it first.
- No, you didn't.

963
01:02:16,555 --> 01:02:18,223
- I'm buying it.
- Give it to me!

964
01:02:18,307 --> 01:02:20,184
- No way!
- Mom!

965
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:25,814
- Dad, I don't like this.
- That's just too bad.

966
01:02:27,149 --> 01:02:28,776
Hey, stand somewhere else.

967
01:02:30,402 --> 01:02:32,863
You stay right here with me
and hold my hand!

968
01:02:36,158 --> 01:02:39,912
- I wanna see reindeer.
- Stop pushing!

969
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,208
- Why are we here?
- Because you wanted to...

970
01:02:44,333 --> 01:02:46,460
<i>Kids, how much your parents love you</i>

971
01:02:46,585 --> 01:02:49,338
<i>depends on how much
they spend on your present.</i>

972
01:02:49,463 --> 01:02:51,632
Hurry up, Dad, let's go!

973
01:02:52,966 --> 01:02:55,511
- Come on, I want a ride!
- Lucy!

974
01:02:55,636 --> 01:02:58,889
- Neil!
- Scott Calvin.

975
01:02:58,972 --> 01:03:00,724
Odd place to run into you.

976
01:03:03,185 --> 01:03:04,603
Luce?

977
01:03:04,686 --> 01:03:06,980
What's up, Mr Calvin?

978
01:03:07,064 --> 01:03:08,857
Can we please go?

979
01:03:09,691 --> 01:03:13,153
Wait, wait, wait. What happened
between you and Laura?

980
01:03:13,237 --> 01:03:17,324
I know you think therapy is like
witchcraft, but you might consider it.

981
01:03:17,407 --> 01:03:20,369
Please, please, just tell me.

982
01:03:22,913 --> 01:03:25,916
You don't really know
because you were never around.

983
01:03:25,999 --> 01:03:28,126
It shouldn't be any news to you, Scott.

984
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,212
You were never a father to Charlie.

985
01:03:30,295 --> 01:03:33,215
You put all the pressure on me,
and guess what?

986
01:03:33,298 --> 01:03:35,384
He didn't want me to be his father...

987
01:03:37,553 --> 01:03:41,014
...which messed things up pretty good
between me and Laura.

988
01:03:41,098 --> 01:03:42,891
Want me to go on, Scott?

989
01:03:42,975 --> 01:03:45,769
Come on, Dad, the line's getting longer.

990
01:03:50,983 --> 01:03:52,401
Excuse me, sir.

991
01:03:53,735 --> 01:03:55,112
- Curtis.
- Yes, sir.

992
01:03:55,195 --> 01:03:59,032
Can I offer you two tickets for a turn
to build a toy with Santa's elves?

993
01:03:59,116 --> 01:04:04,037
I'll throw in this commemorative pen,
voice-enhanced. Cash or credit card?

994
01:04:04,121 --> 01:04:06,290
<i>- Cash or credit card?
- That's silly.</i>

995
01:04:06,373 --> 01:04:09,209
Not sure, I'll throw in
a pass for the nice list.

996
01:04:09,293 --> 01:04:10,752
Walk with me, won't you?

997
01:04:10,836 --> 01:04:13,589
Curtis, it's me.
Oh, for the love of candy canes,

998
01:04:13,672 --> 01:04:15,257
what have you done here?

999
01:04:15,340 --> 01:04:19,803
Well, sir, this is a nice list kiosk.
The line ends by the petting zoo.

1000
01:04:19,886 --> 01:04:22,931
Parents pay to have
their kids put on the nice list?

1001
01:04:23,015 --> 01:04:26,226
Not right. I better change things
back the way they were.

1002
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:28,228
Who's your boss?

1003
01:04:28,312 --> 01:04:29,938
Where's Frost?

1004
01:04:30,772 --> 01:04:32,357
Curtis, where's Frost?

1005
01:04:32,441 --> 01:04:35,235
- Security!
- Bring Frost out here right now!

1006
01:04:35,319 --> 01:04:37,279
I'll take care of him.

1007
01:04:40,699 --> 01:04:42,326
Look, there's Santa.

1008
01:04:43,619 --> 01:04:46,705
<i>Nice to see you, mon frere.
I've been waiting.</i>

1009
01:04:46,830 --> 01:04:49,041
Has it been 12 years already?

1010
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:52,544
Frost. What have you done?

1011
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,379
Hey. Easy does it, Armani man.

1012
01:04:54,504 --> 01:04:57,090
No hello? Love what you've
done with the place?

1013
01:04:57,215 --> 01:04:59,384
<i>Shave a reindeer for five dollars.</i>

1014
01:04:59,509 --> 01:05:03,472
What about the secret of Santa?
How could you do this to the North Pole?

1015
01:05:03,555 --> 01:05:06,600
The whole thing is way too much work,
too much pressure.

1016
01:05:06,683 --> 01:05:09,061
No one even thanks you
for all the effort.

1017
01:05:09,144 --> 01:05:12,439
No thank yous? What about
the plates of cookies and milk?

1018
01:05:12,522 --> 01:05:14,608
Please, I'm cleansing.

1019
01:05:14,691 --> 01:05:17,027
I stopped the whole
toy delivery nonsense

1020
01:05:17,110 --> 01:05:19,905
and brought anyone
who could afford to pay up here.

1021
01:05:20,739 --> 01:05:24,409
Who needs magic? Who needs to be
crawling on roofs and chimneys?

1022
01:05:24,493 --> 01:05:27,079
I got everything I need right here.

1023
01:05:27,162 --> 01:05:31,833
Look around. This isn't how the North
Pole's supposed to be. This is wrong.

1024
01:05:31,917 --> 01:05:34,503
Why don't you chill out
and enjoy the swag, huh?

1025
01:05:34,586 --> 01:05:36,963
This junk is not
what Christmas is about.

1026
01:05:37,047 --> 01:05:39,800
- You're the one who gave it up.
- You tricked me.

1027
01:05:39,883 --> 01:05:43,136
- Give me a break.
- I didn't know you had my snow globe.

1028
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:46,515
Maybe not, but who said,
"I wish I'd never been Santa at all"?

1029
01:05:46,598 --> 01:05:47,641
What?

1030
01:05:47,724 --> 01:05:50,936
I said, "Who said
'I wish I'd never been Santa at all'?"

1031
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:53,105
Rudolph? Rudolph's mama?

1032
01:05:53,188 --> 01:05:56,066
Frost, switch back with me.
Now's your chance.

1033
01:05:56,149 --> 01:05:58,652
And this is your chance
to enjoy the show.

1034
01:05:58,735 --> 01:06:00,112
- Security.
- Yes, sir.

1035
01:06:00,195 --> 01:06:02,364
Take my guest to his seat, won't you?

1036
01:06:03,198 --> 01:06:04,491
Thanks so much.

1037
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:06,576
Come on, let's go.

1038
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:09,663
<i>Tickets on sale now
for the 6:00 elf toss.</i>

1039
01:06:18,922 --> 01:06:21,925
<i>Never too late to get tickets
to Santa's show.</i>

1040
01:06:47,158 --> 01:06:48,535
Hey, Luce.

1041
01:06:50,620 --> 01:06:53,290
I know something really
wonderful about you.

1042
01:06:54,374 --> 01:06:57,127
- You love snow globes.
- Yeah.

1043
01:06:57,252 --> 01:07:00,171
Well, if that's true,
I've got a surprise for you.

1044
01:07:00,297 --> 01:07:01,840
Just up those stairs,

1045
01:07:01,965 --> 01:07:04,634
behind the vending machine
is a secret room

1046
01:07:04,718 --> 01:07:07,762
filled with snow globes
like you've never seen before.

1047
01:07:07,846 --> 01:07:12,601
Beautiful snow globes. There's
a secret code to get in that room.

1048
01:07:12,684 --> 01:07:14,019
What's the code?

1049
01:07:21,902 --> 01:07:23,695
You grab the one in the middle

1050
01:07:23,778 --> 01:07:25,697
and bring it back down to me.

1051
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,657
I need your help.

1052
01:07:27,741 --> 01:07:31,119
But I don't want to go
up there all alone.

1053
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:34,247
Lucy...

1054
01:07:35,415 --> 01:07:36,708
...trust me.

1055
01:07:36,791 --> 01:07:38,793
This is really important.

1056
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:49,763
- OK.
- OK.

1057
01:07:49,846 --> 01:07:53,266
OK. I'll create a little diversion.

1058
01:07:54,601 --> 01:07:56,519
Boy, this show stinks.

1059
01:07:56,603 --> 01:07:58,146
Come on.

1060
01:07:58,229 --> 01:07:59,814
Hey, hold it!

1061
01:07:59,898 --> 01:08:02,984
- Coming through.
- You can't catch me. Come on, guys.

1062
01:08:03,068 --> 01:08:04,861
Can't catch an old dog like me?

1063
01:08:04,944 --> 01:08:06,738
Lucy? Lucy!

1064
01:08:12,619 --> 01:08:15,455
<i>Grab a seat, everybody.
The show's about to begin.</i>

1065
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:34,010
Thank you! Thank you!

1066
01:10:38,181 --> 01:10:41,935
I'm gonna kick the coal
out of whoever did that.

1067
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:46,564
- You.
- You're not Santa Claus.

1068
01:10:46,689 --> 01:10:49,317
That is an impostor. I'm Santa Claus.

1069
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:52,403
Guards! Guards, get him!

1070
01:10:53,905 --> 01:10:56,908
Bring it on! Who wants
some of this? Come here!

1071
01:10:57,825 --> 01:11:00,912
If you don't mind...

1072
01:11:00,995 --> 01:11:03,414
Where are you going?
Get down from there!

1073
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:05,416
Guess if you guys want me,

1074
01:11:05,541 --> 01:11:07,710
you're gonna have to come up here

1075
01:11:07,835 --> 01:11:09,796
and get me!

1076
01:11:42,870 --> 01:11:44,664
Get this through your head.

1077
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:47,250
You're not Santa anymore.

1078
01:11:47,333 --> 01:11:50,753
You're just a guy
who smells like a cookie.

1079
01:11:58,511 --> 01:12:00,805
Hey, how about a game of catch?

1080
01:12:00,888 --> 01:12:02,557
Lucy, toss it.

1081
01:12:18,614 --> 01:12:20,867
Nice try, compadre.

1082
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:26,831
And lovely teamwork.
There's only one problem.

1083
01:12:26,914 --> 01:12:29,167
You're never gonna get me to say...

1084
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:31,586
<i>I wish I'd never been Santa at all.</i>

1085
01:12:32,795 --> 01:12:35,381
Now who said that? Rudolph?

1086
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:37,717
Rudolph's mama?

1087
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:47,435
No!

1088
01:12:57,486 --> 01:12:59,447
Ho ho ho.

1089
01:13:02,658 --> 01:13:04,368
I gotta get my coat back.

1090
01:13:09,540 --> 01:13:10,708
Come here.

1091
01:13:11,959 --> 01:13:14,170
- Boy, you are just...
- Hey!

1092
01:13:22,762 --> 01:13:25,097
- Whoa. Freaky.
- Hey, you!

1093
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:27,516
Ho ho... Uh-oh!

1094
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,268
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1095
01:13:37,485 --> 01:13:39,403
Let me go! That coat belongs to me.

1096
01:13:39,487 --> 01:13:42,073
No, Frost, that coat belongs to him.

1097
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:44,200
You got him!

1098
01:13:44,283 --> 01:13:45,993
This guy was huge.

1099
01:13:46,077 --> 01:13:48,746
- I'm Santa now.
- You don't look like Santa.

1100
01:13:48,829 --> 01:13:51,332
- You killed him.
- Did not.

1101
01:13:51,415 --> 01:13:55,878
- I want my coat.
- Dad, you gotta see this.

1102
01:13:55,962 --> 01:13:58,798
Charlie, Charlie!
Stay away from those things.

1103
01:13:58,881 --> 01:14:00,383
I want the coat!

1104
01:14:00,466 --> 01:14:04,303
'Cause you make such a good Santa?
Because all the elves love you?

1105
01:14:04,387 --> 01:14:06,764
Those people you
took money from love you?

1106
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:11,435
Listen to me, listen to me. Being
Santa's not something you could take.

1107
01:14:11,519 --> 01:14:13,896
It's something that chooses you.

1108
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:17,108
Well... how do I look?
Nice?

1109
01:14:17,191 --> 01:14:18,734
And you're too late.

1110
01:14:25,074 --> 01:14:28,077
No!

1111
01:14:38,462 --> 01:14:40,131
Carol.

1112
01:14:41,424 --> 01:14:42,758
Carol!

1113
01:14:44,301 --> 01:14:46,804
Well, that didn't work out
the way I'd hoped.

1114
01:14:46,887 --> 01:14:49,098
Carol.

1115
01:14:49,181 --> 01:14:52,768
Oh, Scott.
We've been looking everywhere for you.

1116
01:14:52,852 --> 01:14:54,103
Come here.

1117
01:14:54,186 --> 01:14:56,105
Oh, Mrs Claus, I've missed you.

1118
01:14:56,188 --> 01:15:00,234
- I missed you so much, so much.
- Wait, it's just been a few minutes.

1119
01:15:02,319 --> 01:15:04,864
- It's only been a few minutes?
- Yes.

1120
01:15:04,989 --> 01:15:09,285
Of course. It only takes a few minutes
to see the truth of an entire lifetime.

1121
01:15:09,410 --> 01:15:11,954
- I don't understand.
- A man goes in the world,

1122
01:15:12,037 --> 01:15:14,790
and expects his dreams
to come true, and then...

1123
01:15:14,874 --> 01:15:18,127
...the unexpected happens.
Pick up a coat and become Santa.

1124
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:22,840
That's huge! A lot of pressure, taking
care of the children of the world,

1125
01:15:22,965 --> 01:15:25,926
and the elves and the SOS
and the North Pole,

1126
01:15:26,051 --> 01:15:30,473
but he loses sight of what's important:
The woman who falls in love with him...

1127
01:15:31,515 --> 01:15:35,269
...and gives him a baby.

1128
01:15:35,352 --> 01:15:38,439
- I love being Santa and I love you.
- I love you, too.

1129
01:15:38,522 --> 01:15:41,984
- Have you been drinking cocoa?
- No. I'm back.

1130
01:15:42,985 --> 01:15:45,863
- I've missed you very, very much.
- I missed you too.

1131
01:15:49,074 --> 01:15:50,534
Ohh.

1132
01:15:50,618 --> 01:15:52,578
Hey, you guys know what happened?

1133
01:15:52,661 --> 01:15:55,039
- No.
- We ticked each other off. That's it.

1134
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:58,042
Like families all over
the world do on Christmas Eve

1135
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,753
that love each other,
ticking each other off.

1136
01:16:00,836 --> 01:16:05,507
They don't have to be perfect to be good
families. We just have to be together.

1137
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:08,636
I'm still so very sorry

1138
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,680
that we added to all
this pressure that you're under.

1139
01:16:13,265 --> 01:16:15,726
I think that we should apologise.
Don't you?

1140
01:16:15,809 --> 01:16:19,772
No. It's good I'm tough on him.
I'm his father-in-law. It's my job.

1141
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:23,192
As long as you promise to do it
every Christmas, it's fine.

1142
01:16:23,275 --> 01:16:25,444
We'll see about that.
I'm a busy guy.

1143
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:28,280
And so am I. And I'd like
to show you guys what I do.

1144
01:16:28,364 --> 01:16:30,574
- The SOS.
- The SOS is about secrets,

1145
01:16:30,658 --> 01:16:34,662
secrets aren't for families. I'm tired
of keeping you from your family.

1146
01:16:34,745 --> 01:16:37,873
So if you guys would
follow me to my factory.

1147
01:16:58,018 --> 01:16:59,645
Elves?

1148
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:03,399
Elves! Stop working for a minute.

1149
01:17:03,524 --> 01:17:06,527
I'd like you all to say
hello to the in-laws.

1150
01:17:06,610 --> 01:17:09,697
Hello, in-laws!

1151
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:12,408
- Hello.
- How ya doin'?

1152
01:17:15,619 --> 01:17:17,329
- Elves.
- Oh, my.

1153
01:17:17,413 --> 01:17:19,790
They're not Canadians. They're elves.

1154
01:17:19,873 --> 01:17:21,417
Never said... in person...

1155
01:17:21,542 --> 01:17:23,585
Listen, if they're elves,

1156
01:17:23,669 --> 01:17:25,546
this is not a toy factory.

1157
01:17:25,671 --> 01:17:28,132
This is probably Santa's workshop.

1158
01:17:28,257 --> 01:17:31,802
- And if this is probably...
- If this is Santa's workshop,

1159
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:34,054
...then... he...
- Then he's the guy.

1160
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:38,517
Hey, you... you're the guy.
You're Father Christmas.

1161
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:41,729
It's a little freaky,
but... you'll get used to it.

1162
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,565
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1163
01:17:44,648 --> 01:17:45,941
Whoa!

1164
01:17:46,024 --> 01:17:48,944
If you're Father Christmas
that means

1165
01:17:49,027 --> 01:17:51,280
I'm Father Christmas' father-in-law.

1166
01:17:51,363 --> 01:17:55,492
That means I'm...
I'm Father-in-law Christmas.

1167
01:17:55,576 --> 01:17:58,245
And I'm Mother-in-law Christmas.

1168
01:17:58,328 --> 01:17:59,663
Whoa!

1169
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:02,416
Whoa!

1170
01:18:02,499 --> 01:18:05,002
Hi, Santa!

1171
01:18:05,085 --> 01:18:06,462
Hi, Bud!

1172
01:18:07,963 --> 01:18:10,090
Sylvia.

1173
01:18:11,175 --> 01:18:16,054
Oh, the little pellets behind me?
I'll clean those up later.

1174
01:18:16,138 --> 01:18:19,057
Santa, where do you keep
the Phillips screwdrivers?

1175
01:18:19,141 --> 01:18:21,769
Oh, elf construction. Talk to Irv, OK?

1176
01:18:21,852 --> 01:18:23,270
Oh, oh, Cupid!

1177
01:18:24,688 --> 01:18:27,691
At this altitude you might
consider an underdiaper.

1178
01:18:27,775 --> 01:18:29,193
I don't mind the draught.

1179
01:18:30,402 --> 01:18:32,779
- That was Cupid.
- Yeah.

1180
01:18:32,863 --> 01:18:34,406
Hello, Santa.

1181
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:37,784
- Father Time.
- Father Time. What next?

1182
01:18:37,868 --> 01:18:40,078
Well, hello, Santa.

1183
01:18:40,162 --> 01:18:42,289
This is a blast!

1184
01:18:42,372 --> 01:18:43,707
Mother Nature.

1185
01:18:44,958 --> 01:18:48,378
- How can I ever thank you for this?
- Oh, don't thank me.

1186
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:50,672
- He's the one who brought us here.
- Dad.

1187
01:18:50,756 --> 01:18:52,049
Charlie!

1188
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:53,675
- Hi, Santa!
- Hey, Tooth.

1189
01:18:53,759 --> 01:18:55,344
- Hi, Santa.
- Sandy.

1190
01:18:55,427 --> 01:18:59,014
Checked in with Curtis and found out you
were behind, so I called professionals.

1191
01:18:59,014 --> 01:18:59,932
Checked in with Curtis and found out you
were behind, so I called professionals.

1192
01:19:00,641 --> 01:19:02,142
Uncle Scott!

1193
01:19:03,393 --> 01:19:06,522
- Lucy, what's happened?
- I found her locked in a closet.

1194
01:19:06,605 --> 01:19:07,606
What's wrong?

1195
01:19:07,731 --> 01:19:10,734
You've got to see what Frost
did to my mom and dad.

1196
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:28,418
It's gonna be OK.

1197
01:19:41,056 --> 01:19:42,307
Yeah, and...?

1198
01:19:42,391 --> 01:19:44,685
Elficers, I have him.

1199
01:19:45,727 --> 01:19:47,980
Jack, this isn't funny.

1200
01:19:48,063 --> 01:19:50,107
Unfreeze the parents right now.

1201
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:54,069
No way, Claus. I can't unfreeze them
without unfreezing myself,

1202
01:19:54,152 --> 01:19:57,155
and that is something I'll never do.

1203
01:19:58,490 --> 01:20:00,033
Mother Nature, help me out.

1204
01:20:00,117 --> 01:20:02,661
- Can you thaw him out?
- I'm sorry, Santa.

1205
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:05,330
Our powers don't work
on legendary figures.

1206
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:07,624
Isn't that a shame?

1207
01:20:26,810 --> 01:20:30,230
- What do you say, Luce?
- Do you think it'll work?

1208
01:20:31,606 --> 01:20:34,276
The question is, do you?

1209
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,097
OK.

1210
01:21:04,181 --> 01:21:07,434
This is what you're all reduced to?

1211
01:21:09,144 --> 01:21:12,230
Sending a little girl in
to save the day, are we?

1212
01:21:13,482 --> 01:21:16,735
What you gonna do, adorablise me?

1213
01:21:16,818 --> 01:21:19,029
Sweet me into submission?

1214
01:21:19,154 --> 01:21:21,114
Cute me to death?

1215
01:21:22,282 --> 01:21:24,826
Make me change my... way!

1216
01:21:25,869 --> 01:21:27,245
Hey.

1217
01:21:27,329 --> 01:21:29,456
I feel so strange.

1218
01:21:31,082 --> 01:21:34,336
It's so gushy inside.

1219
01:21:36,713 --> 01:21:38,173
Do I smell suntan lotion?

1220
01:21:39,090 --> 01:21:40,884
I feel so tropical.

1221
01:21:44,930 --> 01:21:47,349
What's happening to me?

1222
01:21:47,432 --> 01:21:49,684
I'm warming your heart.

1223
01:21:49,768 --> 01:21:52,521
But they told me it couldn't be done.

1224
01:21:52,604 --> 01:21:55,941
But they didn't know
about magical hugs.

1225
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:03,949
I think I like it.

1226
01:22:25,136 --> 01:22:26,972
Mom, Dad!

1227
01:22:27,055 --> 01:22:28,515
- Lucy!
- Mom! Dad!

1228
01:22:31,726 --> 01:22:32,978
Group hug!

1229
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:42,988
- Feel the love.
- Yes.

1230
01:23:18,315 --> 01:23:21,985
- Oh, Scott. It's time.
- Oh, about 10:00.

1231
01:23:22,068 --> 01:23:23,945
It's time to deliver the package.

1232
01:23:24,070 --> 01:23:25,572
No. Midnight, as usual.

1233
01:23:25,655 --> 01:23:27,699
No, it's time to deliver the package.

1234
01:23:31,745 --> 01:23:35,248
- Yeah.
- It's time to deliver the package!

1235
01:23:35,373 --> 01:23:37,751
Baby Claus is on the way!

1236
01:23:48,511 --> 01:23:52,599
And then the most magical thing of all

1237
01:23:52,682 --> 01:23:54,934
is that I got to deliver

1238
01:23:55,060 --> 01:23:58,021
just before Santa had to deliver.

1239
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:01,483
Are you telling the stories again?

1240
01:24:01,566 --> 01:24:03,443
So cute!

1241
01:24:04,235 --> 01:24:07,947
Make sure you get to the part about
Santa changing a mean diaper.

1242
01:24:10,825 --> 01:24:12,494
So who got to pick out the name?

1243
01:24:12,577 --> 01:24:15,205
That was easy.
We named him after his grandpa.

1244
01:24:15,288 --> 01:24:19,000
That's right.
Say hello to Buddy Claus.

1245
01:24:20,627 --> 01:24:22,629
What's going on?

1246
01:24:52,116 --> 01:24:54,536
<i>- Keep rolling. Don't cut.
- Ready, boys?</i>

1247
01:24:54,619 --> 01:24:56,663
<i>- Ready?
- Calm down.</i>

1248
01:24:56,746 --> 01:24:59,707
We'll do it right, Marty. Mark!

1249
01:24:59,791 --> 01:25:01,417
Marker. Action!

1250
01:25:01,501 --> 01:25:03,336
Do you like carrot juice?

1251
01:25:04,212 --> 01:25:06,464
Beta carotene gives me a buzz.

1252
01:25:06,548 --> 01:25:08,049
Honey!

1253
01:25:08,132 --> 01:25:11,344
- I'm built for speed and comfort.
- Ohh.

1254
01:25:13,930 --> 01:25:16,307
You... You weird me out.

1255
01:25:16,391 --> 01:25:19,686
Oh, God.

1256
01:25:19,769 --> 01:25:22,313
Look, I'm not gonna... evoke?

1257
01:25:22,438 --> 01:25:24,190
Invoke.

1258
01:25:24,274 --> 01:25:26,484
- Look, I'm not gonna evoke...
- Invoke!

1259
01:25:26,609 --> 01:25:29,946
Easy!
I'm not gonna invoke...

1260
01:25:44,669 --> 01:25:48,006
Frost. He turned the North Pole
into an amusement park.

1261
01:25:48,131 --> 01:25:50,592
Why is that... Why is that funny?

1262
01:25:50,717 --> 01:25:52,594
North Pole?

1263
01:25:54,012 --> 01:25:55,263
Is my fly down?

1264
01:25:55,388 --> 01:25:57,682
Frost.

1265
01:25:59,517 --> 01:26:03,438
Is my acting somehow
humorous to you?

1266
01:26:08,443 --> 01:26:11,779
- Well, I'm Santa now.
- Really? You don't look like Santa.

1267
01:26:12,822 --> 01:26:14,615
Well, I am... I'm sorry.

1268
01:26:14,699 --> 01:26:16,743
- That was good.
- That was good.

1269
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:19,996
All of a sudden Rosemary Clooney
showed up. "Well, I am."

1270
01:26:29,505 --> 01:26:33,051
Mother Nature, can you thaw him out?

1271
01:26:34,093 --> 01:26:36,179
Can you thaw him...

1272
01:26:41,559 --> 01:26:43,269
- Tim!
- What?

1273
01:26:43,353 --> 01:26:45,605
I was laughing
'cause it was in the scene.

1274
01:26:45,688 --> 01:26:48,358
- There's no laughing in the scene.
- I was happy.

1275
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:52,131
