2
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:06,396
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

3
00:01:06,854 --> 00:01:07,940
Some kind of an animal.

4
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:09,943
WOMAN: Jesus!
Her water's broken!

5
00:01:10,318 --> 00:01:11,985
She's going into
uterine contractions!

6
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:14,365
We'll have to do
a C-section!

7
00:02:12,604 --> 00:02:13,730
What you got down there,
little man?

8
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,441
Oh, that's
my heat seeker.

9
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:17,527
I'll bet it is.

10
00:02:18,027 --> 00:02:18,610
Aah!

11
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:20,238
Ha ha ha!

12
00:02:20,696 --> 00:02:21,740
So, where are we going?

13
00:02:22,073 --> 00:02:23,410
It's a surprise,
baby.

14
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,202
Yeah, I like surprises.

15
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,082
Yeah.

16
00:02:30,502 --> 00:02:33,379
DENNIS: Whoo!
Oh, my God!

17
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:36,466
What the fuck
are we doing here?

18
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,555
Whoo! Look at all that.

19
00:02:40,931 --> 00:02:43,183
Ha ha ha!

20
00:02:43,726 --> 00:02:45,561
What the fuck is that?

21
00:02:51,484 --> 00:02:52,070
Hey!

22
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,576
What did you just say?

23
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:37,418
Wow.

24
00:03:51,728 --> 00:03:53,772
Whoo! Hey, what's up?

25
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,315
Unh! Man!

26
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,204
Whoo!

27
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:08,163
All right.

28
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,333
Ha ha ha!

29
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:16,258
Yeah.

30
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:18,220
Whoo!

31
00:04:29,483 --> 00:04:32,445
Ha ha ha!

32
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,654
What's happening?

33
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:36,156
Unh!

34
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,625
Whoa!

35
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,752
Man.

36
00:04:50,176 --> 00:04:51,176
Fuck.

37
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:04,359
Fuck. I need a drink.

38
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,683
Ahh!

39
00:05:51,628 --> 00:05:53,463
No! No!

40
00:05:56,883 --> 00:05:58,051
Aah!

41
00:05:58,553 --> 00:06:00,930
What's wrong, baby?

42
00:06:01,346 --> 00:06:03,935
Aah! Aah!

43
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:06,187
No! No!

44
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:09,482
Aah! No!

45
00:06:11,568 --> 00:06:12,610
Ha ha ha!

46
00:06:57,417 --> 00:06:58,378
Is that him?

47
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,129
Jesus, that's him.

48
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,340
It's Blade.
It's the daywalker.

49
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,621
Come on, daywalker!

50
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:38,594
Aah!

51
00:07:46,686 --> 00:07:49,273
Hey! I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

52
00:07:49,732 --> 00:07:50,733
Unh!

53
00:08:05,878 --> 00:08:07,588
Aah!

54
00:08:34,413 --> 00:08:35,999
Aah!

55
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,345
That's him!
That's him! Get him!

56
00:08:46,845 --> 00:08:47,678
Fuck him up!

57
00:08:48,138 --> 00:08:50,893
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

58
00:08:51,308 --> 00:08:53,477
Whoo!

59
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:58,025
Yaah!

60
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:42,872
Yaah!

61
00:09:56,808 --> 00:09:59,310
Quinn...

62
00:09:59,769 --> 00:10:02,940
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

63
00:10:07,445 --> 00:10:10,867
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

64
00:10:13,995 --> 00:10:15,789
Give my regards to Frost.

65
00:10:19,168 --> 00:10:21,464
No! Please don't!

66
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,983
Put him out.

67
00:10:37,525 --> 00:10:39,526
Yes, sir.
Paramedics.

68
00:11:01,222 --> 00:11:05,476
Got a charred cadaver here
for you. Still warm, too.

69
00:11:05,852 --> 00:11:07,562
1, 2,3.

70
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:14,947
Oh, Jesus, that's rank.

71
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:17,408
Paramedics said
he was still screaming

72
00:11:17,909 --> 00:11:21,286
when they found him
stapled to a wall.

73
00:11:21,704 --> 00:11:23,583
That's very pretty.

74
00:11:36,723 --> 00:11:37,724
CURTIS: Did you check
the chem count?

75
00:11:38,183 --> 00:11:39,810
His blood sugar's
3 times norm,

76
00:11:40,228 --> 00:11:41,605
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

77
00:11:42,105 --> 00:11:45,235
KAREN: You took this
off a D.O.A?

78
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:47,487
Yeah.

79
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,697
But this doesn't
make any sense.

80
00:11:52,702 --> 00:11:54,288
The red blood cells
are biconvex,

81
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:55,789
which is impossible.

82
00:11:56,332 --> 00:11:59,585
Look at the polys.
They're binucleated.

83
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:05,634
OK, Curtis, it's 3.00
in the morning...

84
00:12:06,094 --> 00:12:07,095
This is not a joke.

85
00:12:07,512 --> 00:12:10,725
I've got the body sitting
in the morgue right now.

86
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:13,520
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

87
00:12:14,062 --> 00:12:16,689
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

88
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,536
OK. Show me the body.

89
00:12:26,995 --> 00:12:29,205
And I don't want to hear
a word about us.

90
00:12:29,706 --> 00:12:32,251
Done. We've had
that conversation.

91
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,050
You haven't started on
the internal organs yet?

92
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:41,220
Just a blood sample
through the pericardium.

93
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:46,060
The maxilla looks
a little deformed.

94
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,855
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

95
00:12:49,315 --> 00:12:50,316
I'm going
to start the "Y"

96
00:12:50,775 --> 00:12:52,151
and check
the tracheal mucosa.

97
00:12:57,282 --> 00:13:00,118
Let me ask you
something.

98
00:13:00,578 --> 00:13:01,205
Honestly...

99
00:13:01,622 --> 00:13:03,958
you ever have second
thoughts about us?

100
00:13:07,672 --> 00:13:09,089
Sometimes.

101
00:13:11,173 --> 00:13:13,052
But then I remember how much
of an asshole you were.

102
00:13:13,553 --> 00:13:14,595
Want to cut me
some slack here?

103
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:17,474
You asked for some time off,
I gave you some time off.

104
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:18,517
Look, Curtis...

105
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,104
I'm trying.

106
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:21,480
It's over.

107
00:13:30,574 --> 00:13:33,578
Yaah!

108
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:40,670
Aah!

109
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:43,089
KAREN:
Call security!

110
00:13:57,442 --> 00:13:58,275
Aah!

111
00:13:58,734 --> 00:14:00,069
Came back
to finish you off.

112
00:14:00,528 --> 00:14:01,614
Get out of my way,
you freak!

113
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:11,167
Freeze!

114
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,090
Motherfucker, are you
out of your damn mind?

115
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:17,466
Aah!
Aah!

116
00:14:19,176 --> 00:14:22,054
Yaah!

117
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:28,021
Aah!

118
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:09,697
Hey, you! Freeze!

119
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,212
Aah!

120
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,255
Aah!

121
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:24,506
Aah!

122
00:15:28,304 --> 00:15:28,887
Freeze!

123
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,266
Hold it right there!

124
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:41,695
Aah! Aah!

125
00:15:46,535 --> 00:15:47,620
My shoulder.

126
00:15:48,746 --> 00:15:50,249
It's dislocated.

127
00:15:53,042 --> 00:15:54,753
Aah!

128
00:16:01,595 --> 00:16:01,596
Uhh!

129
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:40,760
BLADE: Whistler.

130
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,892
Whistler.

131
00:17:51,984 --> 00:17:53,735
Bringing home
strays now?

132
00:17:56,153 --> 00:17:57,365
She's been bitten.

133
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:03,164
Should've
killed her, then.

134
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,209
Yeah, I know.

135
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:09,171
But I didn't.

136
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:17,974
You watch her close.

137
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:21,227
If she starts to turn,
you finish her off.

138
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,818
Or I will.

139
00:18:29,781 --> 00:18:30,782
KAREN: Uhh.

140
00:18:34,035 --> 00:18:35,746
She's borderline.

141
00:18:37,456 --> 00:18:41,212
Another hour, she'd be
well into the change.

142
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,048
Dr Karen Jenson,

143
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,260
listen close.

144
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:48,595
I'm going to inject you
with Allium sativum...

145
00:18:49,096 --> 00:18:50,597
garlic.

146
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:52,934
This is going
to hurt... a lot.

147
00:18:53,351 --> 00:18:55,146
It was Quinn.

148
00:18:55,688 --> 00:18:57,606
Frost's little
errand boy?

149
00:18:58,107 --> 00:18:59,734
You get
a lead on him?

150
00:19:00,194 --> 00:19:00,778
No.

151
00:19:01,319 --> 00:19:03,906
Too bad.

152
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:06,159
Uhh!

153
00:19:06,535 --> 00:19:07,619
Hold her.

154
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:20,511
I give her fifty-fifty

155
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:24,474
if she makes it
through the night.

156
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,132
Blade...

157
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,217
the daywalker...

158
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:56,680
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

159
00:19:59,642 --> 00:20:01,110
How many died?

160
00:20:01,145 --> 00:20:04,190
We don't have
an exact count.

161
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:06,443
Apparently, he used
a lot of silver.

162
00:20:06,903 --> 00:20:08,154
We're having
difficulty...

163
00:20:08,653 --> 00:20:09,989
Send in Frost.

164
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:19,877
Deacon Frost.

165
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,384
You can come in now.

166
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,219
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

167
00:21:01,804 --> 00:21:03,222
Are they?

168
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:06,183
They draw needless
attention to our kind.

169
00:21:06,643 --> 00:21:07,435
You know our policy.

170
00:21:07,811 --> 00:21:09,562
Your policy,
not mine.

171
00:21:10,146 --> 00:21:11,731
GITANO:
Our livelihood...

172
00:21:12,232 --> 00:21:17,113
depends on our ability
to blend in

173
00:21:17,572 --> 00:21:19,574
and our discretion.

174
00:21:19,952 --> 00:21:23,372
Maybe it's time we forgot
about discretion.

175
00:21:23,831 --> 00:21:25,207
We should be ruling
the humans,

176
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,335
not running around

177
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:28,127
making back-alley treaties
with them.

178
00:21:28,545 --> 00:21:30,629
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food,

179
00:21:31,172 --> 00:21:31,674
not our allies.

180
00:21:32,133 --> 00:21:33,217
You're out of line, Frost.

181
00:21:33,594 --> 00:21:35,052
Am I?

182
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:36,930
Or maybe I'm just
the first to say out loud

183
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,474
what we've
all been thinking.

184
00:21:38,933 --> 00:21:40,393
We have existed this way

185
00:21:40,852 --> 00:21:43,188
for thousands of years.

186
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:44,230
Who are you

187
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,110
to challenge our ways?

188
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,740
You're not even
a pureblood.

189
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:55,453
Like it matters.

190
00:21:56,705 --> 00:22:00,126
I was born a vampire,

191
00:22:00,668 --> 00:22:03,756
as was every other member
of this house,

192
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,549
but you, Frost...

193
00:22:09,012 --> 00:22:11,640
you were merely turned.

194
00:22:13,893 --> 00:22:15,354
The world belongs to us,

195
00:22:15,813 --> 00:22:17,732
not the humans.

196
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:19,525
You know that.

197
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,617
Do we have any other
business to discuss?

198
00:22:27,076 --> 00:22:29,162
Well, uh...

199
00:22:29,746 --> 00:22:31,248
there's the matter of
our offshore accounts.

200
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:32,416
We're having
difficulty...

201
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,750
And have you made
the transfer to the...

202
00:22:34,169 --> 00:22:35,212
Gitano...

203
00:22:35,671 --> 00:22:39,382
you may wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.

204
00:23:12,717 --> 00:23:13,719
You're a week early.

205
00:23:14,177 --> 00:23:15,595
Yeah.

206
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,608
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

207
00:23:28,862 --> 00:23:31,406
Yeah, I figured
that might happen.

208
00:23:40,376 --> 00:23:43,046
You take care, all right?

209
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:29,262
WHISTLER: I must be getting
soft in my old age,

210
00:25:29,804 --> 00:25:32,684
letting you bring home
a stray like that.

211
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,310
It was damn stupid of you.

212
00:25:35,769 --> 00:25:37,729
Might've lucked out,
though.

213
00:25:39,108 --> 00:25:41,568
I checked her background.

214
00:25:44,114 --> 00:25:47,200
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

215
00:25:48,284 --> 00:25:51,248
She might be useful to us.

216
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,125
I doubt it.

217
00:25:54,792 --> 00:25:56,211
I'm serious.

218
00:25:56,712 --> 00:25:58,173
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

219
00:25:58,591 --> 00:26:00,800
She's onto something.

220
00:26:01,802 --> 00:26:04,973
I had to increase
the dose.

221
00:26:06,474 --> 00:26:08,143
It's over
50 milligrams now.

222
00:26:08,643 --> 00:26:09,605
That's getting
dangerous.

223
00:26:10,105 --> 00:26:11,147
Just do it,

224
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:13,359
old man.

225
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:16,237
Ahh.

226
00:26:26,499 --> 00:26:27,709
Uhh...

227
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:15,978
Wander off
the beaten path, Doctor?

228
00:27:18,022 --> 00:27:19,316
Who are you people?

229
00:27:19,692 --> 00:27:20,818
My name's
Abraham Whistler.

230
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:23,946
You've met Blade.

231
00:27:40,132 --> 00:27:41,635
So, am I
a prisoner here?

232
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,264
Not at all.

233
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:46,892
We just had to take
certain precautions

234
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,352
before we let you go.

235
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:51,314
You got to understand,

236
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:52,731
they're everywhere.

237
00:27:53,149 --> 00:27:54,985
Vampires...

238
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:56,905
the Hominus nocturna.

239
00:27:58,322 --> 00:27:59,491
We hunt them, you see...

240
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:01,577
moving from one city
to the next

241
00:28:01,612 --> 00:28:03,287
tracking
their migrations.

242
00:28:03,704 --> 00:28:04,872
They're hard to kill.

243
00:28:05,331 --> 00:28:06,749
They tend to regenerate.

244
00:28:07,251 --> 00:28:08,293
And I'm supposed
to believe all this?

245
00:28:08,752 --> 00:28:11,755
Well, you already met
Mr. Crispy at the hospital.

246
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:13,591
What do you think?

247
00:28:15,636 --> 00:28:17,179
So, what do you use, then?

248
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:19,265
Stakes? Crosses?

249
00:28:19,807 --> 00:28:21,267
Crosses don't do squat.

250
00:28:21,767 --> 00:28:24,396
Some of the legends
are true, though.

251
00:28:24,814 --> 00:28:27,609
Vampires are severely
allergic to silver.

252
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:29,654
Feed them garlic,

253
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:31,239
and they go into
anaphylactic shock.

254
00:28:31,698 --> 00:28:33,199
Then, of course,
there's always sunlight,

255
00:28:33,658 --> 00:28:35,119
ultraviolet rays.

256
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:38,247
I got this sucker
running.

257
00:28:38,749 --> 00:28:40,792
You want to give it
a try tonight?

258
00:28:46,882 --> 00:28:47,968
It's still heavy.

259
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:50,763
Well, you're so big.

260
00:28:53,224 --> 00:28:54,434
If you want to live
to see another day,

261
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:56,354
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

262
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:58,814
So where am I
supposed to go?

263
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:04,779
You've been exposed to them.

264
00:29:05,238 --> 00:29:08,578
One way or another, somebody's
going to take you out.

265
00:29:13,124 --> 00:29:15,961
There's a war going on
out there.

266
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,840
Blade, myself,
a few others,

267
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:20,301
we've tried to keep it
from spilling over

268
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,384
onto the streets.

269
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:23,929
Sometimes,
people like yourself

270
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,808
get caught
in the crossfire.

271
00:29:27,308 --> 00:29:29,311
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

272
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:32,273
They own the police.

273
00:29:32,774 --> 00:29:34,151
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

274
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:36,320
Chances are you've
seen them yourself

275
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:37,404
and didn't know it...

276
00:29:37,905 --> 00:29:39,741
on the subway
or in a bar.

277
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,288
So that's it?

278
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:47,750
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

279
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:53,174
Here.

280
00:29:53,717 --> 00:29:55,050
Vampire mace...

281
00:29:56,552 --> 00:29:58,222
silver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

282
00:29:58,765 --> 00:30:00,975
You keep your eyes open.

283
00:30:01,351 --> 00:30:03,313
Be careful.

284
00:30:07,483 --> 00:30:08,817
One other thing...

285
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,323
buy yourself a gun.

286
00:30:12,782 --> 00:30:16,371
If you start getting
sensitive to daylight...

287
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:18,580
if you find
you're thirsty

288
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,836
regardless of how much
you had to drink,

289
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:23,378
then I suggest
you take that gun

290
00:30:23,837 --> 00:30:26,423
and use it on yourself.

291
00:30:29,345 --> 00:30:31,679
Better that
than the alternative.

292
00:31:29,544 --> 00:31:31,296
You have been warned
before.

293
00:31:31,755 --> 00:31:32,798
These archives
are restricted

294
00:31:33,215 --> 00:31:36,261
to members
of the House of Erebus.

295
00:31:38,472 --> 00:31:40,015
You are wasting your time.

296
00:31:40,474 --> 00:31:42,144
It's a dead language.

297
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,357
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

298
00:31:46,816 --> 00:31:49,653
You wouldn't even
understand them.

299
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:52,740
Damn it, Frost!

300
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:54,283
I'm talking to you!

301
00:31:55,618 --> 00:31:57,912
Shh.

302
00:31:58,414 --> 00:32:00,792
Keep your voice down,
Gitano.

303
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:04,046
We're in a library.

304
00:32:04,504 --> 00:32:05,464
You don't need
to shout.

305
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,885
What are you up to,
Frost?

306
00:32:20,483 --> 00:32:23,652
What are you
going to do, hmm?

307
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,160
What?

308
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,294
You bore me.

309
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:06,539
Hey!

310
00:33:11,296 --> 00:33:13,799
BLADE: Remember
what we told you.

311
00:33:14,217 --> 00:33:16,093
You keep your eyes open.

312
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,178
They're everywhere.

313
00:33:19,389 --> 00:33:20,975
But it's daytime!

314
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,094
How you doing?

315
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:42,360
Hi there. Hey.

316
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:43,444
I'm sorry. Whoa, whoa!

317
00:35:43,986 --> 00:35:45,362
Whoa. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

318
00:35:45,821 --> 00:35:46,406
Police officer.

319
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,698
I'm sorry, OK?

320
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,285
Police officer. I didn't
mean to scare you.

321
00:35:49,743 --> 00:35:50,328
The front door was open.

322
00:35:50,703 --> 00:35:51,496
What are you doing in here?

323
00:35:51,872 --> 00:35:54,750
I'm just here
on a routine check.

324
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,336
Look, I'm...
I'm Officer Krieger,

325
00:35:56,835 --> 00:35:57,795
42nd precinct.

326
00:35:58,295 --> 00:36:00,799
You're Karen Jenson,
right?

327
00:36:01,258 --> 00:36:01,676
Yeah.

328
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:04,303
Your co-workers
at the hospital

329
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:07,974
said that you were
kidnapped last night.

330
00:36:08,433 --> 00:36:09,477
Are you OK?

331
00:36:09,853 --> 00:36:12,981
KAREN: What happened to
the other doctor I was with?

332
00:36:14,733 --> 00:36:15,526
Curtis Webb?

333
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:17,528
Um, he died.

334
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:19,615
No, look,

335
00:36:20,031 --> 00:36:21,116
don't worry about that
right now, OK?

336
00:36:21,576 --> 00:36:23,161
Why?

337
00:36:23,702 --> 00:36:26,956
Because you're dead,
too, you bitch.

338
00:36:27,374 --> 00:36:28,542
Aah!

339
00:36:30,293 --> 00:36:31,296
Bitch!
What is it?

340
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,593
What is this, garlic?

341
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:38,388
Yeah. He said it would
work against vampires.

342
00:36:38,763 --> 00:36:40,264
Vampires?

343
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:43,602
Who said I was
a vampire, huh?

344
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,982
Nobody.

345
00:36:51,987 --> 00:36:54,157
He's a familiar...

346
00:36:54,574 --> 00:36:56,243
a vampire wannabe.

347
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:59,456
If he's loyal enough

348
00:36:59,915 --> 00:37:04,461
and he proves himself, maybe
his master will turn him.

349
00:37:04,877 --> 00:37:06,840
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

350
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,051
Get over it.

351
00:37:13,723 --> 00:37:14,767
Is all that necessary?

352
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,650
BLADE: That's a glyph...

353
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,276
a vampire cattle brand.

354
00:37:23,651 --> 00:37:26,239
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

355
00:37:26,698 --> 00:37:28,367
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker,

356
00:37:28,826 --> 00:37:31,204
then they have to answer
to his owner.

357
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:34,915
Deacon Frost.

358
00:37:35,458 --> 00:37:37,378
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

359
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:39,256
All right.

360
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,007
Officer Krieger,

361
00:37:41,383 --> 00:37:43,886
you going to be a good
little bloodhound, huh?

362
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,764
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

363
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:46,931
Oh, great,
now you're robbing him.

364
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:48,391
You going
to rob me, too?

365
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:51,604
How do you think that we
fund this organization, huh?

366
00:37:52,063 --> 00:37:55,526
We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.

367
00:37:57,445 --> 00:37:58,779
It's fake.

368
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:01,867
Well...

369
00:38:03,285 --> 00:38:05,997
Looks like our friend here
has been blood running, huh?

370
00:38:06,331 --> 00:38:07,582
Hillbarn Clinic.

371
00:38:08,082 --> 00:38:09,126
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

372
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,419
Owned by vampires,

373
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:11,879
and there's one
in every city.

374
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:13,422
And they always deliver.

375
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,258
So, where were you
taking it?

376
00:38:15,633 --> 00:38:16,928
I don't know what
you're talking... aah!

377
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,970
Ooh!

378
00:38:18,388 --> 00:38:20,223
Look, take it easy.

379
00:38:20,723 --> 00:38:22,476
I'm only going to ask you
one more time.

380
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:25,146
Where were you taking it?

381
00:38:25,687 --> 00:38:26,980
Go fuck yourself.

382
00:38:27,439 --> 00:38:28,859
Fuck me?
No, you fuck this.

383
00:38:46,421 --> 00:38:48,133
You better wake up.

384
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,387
The world you live in is
just a sugarcoated topping.

385
00:38:51,887 --> 00:38:53,932
There is another world
beneath it...

386
00:38:54,391 --> 00:38:55,099
the real world.

387
00:38:55,601 --> 00:38:56,393
And if you want
to survive it,

388
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,773
you better learn
to pull the trigger.

389
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:04,486
Wait a minute.

390
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:05,530
I'm coming with you.

391
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:07,031
You're useless.

392
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,956
I have to stick with you.

393
00:39:13,414 --> 00:39:15,208
It's the only way that
I'll stay alive long enough

394
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,293
to find a cure for myself.

395
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:19,840
There is no cure.

396
00:39:28,432 --> 00:39:31,104
He's not going
to come back.

397
00:39:32,438 --> 00:39:33,856
Nobody's that stupid.

398
00:39:34,356 --> 00:39:37,152
When you understand
the nature of a thing,

399
00:39:37,612 --> 00:39:39,322
you know what
it's capable of.

400
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:57,928
It's Krieger.

401
00:39:58,470 --> 00:39:59,388
I'm at 16-0-0-9.

402
00:39:59,805 --> 00:40:00,514
DISPATCH: Yes?

403
00:40:01,015 --> 00:40:02,058
Get me through.

404
00:40:05,895 --> 00:40:07,982
KRIEGER: I got a delivery
in progress here,

405
00:40:08,357 --> 00:40:09,651
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

406
00:40:16,159 --> 00:40:18,787
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!

407
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,731
BLADE: Looks like
we hit pay dirt.

408
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:43,694
That's a vampire mark.

409
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,902
It means that
there's a safe house

410
00:40:45,404 --> 00:40:46,571
around here somewhere...

411
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:49,575
a place they can go
with donors coming.

412
00:40:50,034 --> 00:40:51,912
See the valets
over there?

413
00:40:52,287 --> 00:40:53,498
They're vampires.

414
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:56,001
So is the doorman

415
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,045
and the whore
on the corner.

416
00:40:59,505 --> 00:41:00,756
How can you tell?

417
00:41:01,298 --> 00:41:02,093
By the way they move...

418
00:41:03,385 --> 00:41:04,427
the way they smell.

419
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:05,888
Psst.

420
00:41:09,016 --> 00:41:10,601
It's like a bad dream.

421
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,063
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

422
00:41:13,563 --> 00:41:14,356
Like what?

423
00:41:14,816 --> 00:41:16,192
Like me.

424
00:41:17,902 --> 00:41:19,697
OK, Vampire Anatomy 101.

425
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:21,408
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick,

426
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:23,409
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

427
00:41:23,868 --> 00:41:25,788
You use a stake, silver,
or sunlight.

428
00:41:26,204 --> 00:41:27,707
You know how to use
one of these?

429
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:28,959
Nope...

430
00:41:29,459 --> 00:41:30,793
but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

431
00:41:31,294 --> 00:41:32,421
The safety's off,
rounds already chambered...

432
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:33,798
silver hollow point
filled with garlic.

433
00:41:34,173 --> 00:41:35,466
You aim for the head
or the heart.

434
00:41:35,924 --> 00:41:37,468
Anything else is your ass.

435
00:41:40,014 --> 00:41:41,390
Do you have
an invitation?

436
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,347
What you got?

437
00:42:30,618 --> 00:42:31,911
Kenji!

438
00:42:45,761 --> 00:42:46,931
Ohh!

439
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:48,475
Where's the entrance?

440
00:42:48,975 --> 00:42:49,683
I can't tell you
that, man.

441
00:42:50,142 --> 00:42:51,561
Uhh!

442
00:42:54,065 --> 00:42:55,442
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

443
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:57,317
Where's the entrance?

444
00:42:57,818 --> 00:42:59,696
OK. OK.

445
00:43:00,739 --> 00:43:01,783
It's in the freezer.

446
00:43:11,962 --> 00:43:13,255
Come on, man!
I told you!

447
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:15,757
It's in the fridge!

448
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:24,978
OK.

449
00:43:25,479 --> 00:43:27,272
You give Frost
a message from me.

450
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,816
You tell him it's
open season on suckheads.

451
00:44:12,703 --> 00:44:15,292
Some kind of archive.

452
00:44:19,212 --> 00:44:21,424
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

453
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,634
Isn't this just
a little high-tech?

454
00:44:24,052 --> 00:44:26,013
They've got their claws
into everything...

455
00:44:26,637 --> 00:44:28,098
politics, finance,
real estate.

456
00:44:28,557 --> 00:44:31,644
They already own
half of downtown.

457
00:44:54,923 --> 00:44:56,509
Frost throws a good party.

458
00:44:57,009 --> 00:44:58,052
WOMAN: Yeah...

459
00:44:58,593 --> 00:45:00,222
but where is he?

460
00:45:14,196 --> 00:45:15,448
Come on, baby.

461
00:45:25,002 --> 00:45:27,548
Don't keep everyone
waiting.

462
00:45:46,821 --> 00:45:47,823
MAN: Deacon,

463
00:45:48,281 --> 00:45:51,035
there's someone here
to see you.

464
00:45:53,537 --> 00:45:56,249
I got to talk to you,
Frost.

465
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:58,419
KRIEGER: I'm sorry.
I had to come here.

466
00:45:58,878 --> 00:46:00,547
It's a mistake
going to Pearl's.

467
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:02,133
I know that.
Dumb fucking me.

468
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:04,428
I know you're
disappointed.

469
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,511
Am I that
transparent?

470
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,554
You want
to meet him?

471
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:07,597
Yeah.

472
00:46:07,971 --> 00:46:08,849
I can get you guys
in with him,

473
00:46:09,265 --> 00:46:10,560
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

474
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:12,061
Fuck.

475
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,312
Aw, fuck. Frost.

476
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,813
Hey.
Yeah.

477
00:46:15,857 --> 00:46:17,318
Deac. Deac.

478
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:19,571
I've been telling these
bitches all about you, man.

479
00:46:20,028 --> 00:46:20,821
They've been dying
to meet you.

480
00:46:21,281 --> 00:46:21,864
They are so psyched.

481
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:23,409
Bad ass bitches.
They...

482
00:46:23,868 --> 00:46:24,785
Hi.

483
00:46:25,285 --> 00:46:25,828
Deac?

484
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:28,541
Frost, it's about Blade.

485
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,958
Aw, he's busy, you know?

486
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:31,794
Because, like, when
he's focused on business...

487
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:34,757
Look, Frost,
this is important.

488
00:46:35,216 --> 00:46:36,758
Blade was waiting for me,

489
00:46:37,217 --> 00:46:39,177
using the girl as bait.

490
00:46:39,678 --> 00:46:41,140
WOMAN: And you were stupid
enough to take it.

491
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:42,349
Shut up, bitch.

492
00:46:42,725 --> 00:46:43,768
I didn't know he was
going to be there.

493
00:46:44,309 --> 00:46:45,310
It was a trap, see?

494
00:46:45,728 --> 00:46:46,605
But don't worry
about it.

495
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,690
It's no problem. We can
still get the girl.

496
00:46:50,275 --> 00:46:51,568
Yeah!

497
00:46:58,202 --> 00:46:59,413
Whoo!

498
00:47:20,397 --> 00:47:21,439
Forget the girl.

499
00:47:21,898 --> 00:47:22,857
I want Blade.

500
00:47:23,274 --> 00:47:24,778
WOMAN:
I know you do.

501
00:47:25,236 --> 00:47:25,820
You hear me, Quinn?

502
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:28,155
I want him alive.

503
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:29,615
What?

504
00:47:32,411 --> 00:47:33,329
Wait a minute, man.

505
00:47:33,746 --> 00:47:35,581
You want him alive?

506
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:40,129
KAREN: What's that smell?

507
00:47:43,091 --> 00:47:44,926
HIGH-PITCHED VOICE:...image carefully, Frost.

508
00:47:45,428 --> 00:47:50,392
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

509
00:47:50,894 --> 00:47:52,436
Krieger, is that you?

510
00:47:52,895 --> 00:47:53,646
He... he's here!

511
00:47:54,146 --> 00:47:54,688
He's here!

512
00:47:55,188 --> 00:47:56,483
BLADE:
This must be Pearl,

513
00:47:56,942 --> 00:47:57,526
the record keeper.

514
00:47:59,819 --> 00:48:01,573
He's going to kill me!

515
00:48:01,989 --> 00:48:04,034
You need me, Frost!
You need me!

516
00:48:04,577 --> 00:48:05,787
Pearl, you're history.

517
00:48:06,245 --> 00:48:08,289
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.

518
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,082
PEARL: Frost.

519
00:48:10,541 --> 00:48:12,085
Ruthless bloodsucker.

520
00:48:12,585 --> 00:48:13,337
Congratulations, Blade.

521
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,964
Frost.

522
00:48:15,341 --> 00:48:16,508
I hear you've
been lookin' for me.

523
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:17,592
I'm flattered.

524
00:48:18,093 --> 00:48:19,471
It'll pass.

525
00:48:21,973 --> 00:48:22,515
Fuck.

526
00:48:25,478 --> 00:48:26,145
What is that?

527
00:48:26,604 --> 00:48:28,690
That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. Lamp.

528
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:29,774
We're gonna play

529
00:48:30,275 --> 00:48:31,611
a little game
of 20 questions.

530
00:48:32,027 --> 00:48:33,278
Depending on
how you answer,

531
00:48:33,822 --> 00:48:36,324
you may walk out
of here with a tan.

532
00:48:36,782 --> 00:48:37,658
What's that?

533
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:39,495
Oh, that?
Oh, it's nothing.

534
00:48:39,995 --> 00:48:41,456
It's routine research.
Heh heh.

535
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:43,583
Actually,
it's a video game.

536
00:48:54,889 --> 00:48:56,099
That must've hurt.

537
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,143
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

538
00:48:58,686 --> 00:48:59,479
What prophecy?

539
00:48:59,938 --> 00:49:01,439
Oh, I'm not really sure.

540
00:49:01,898 --> 00:49:03,567
There are so many out...

541
00:49:17,708 --> 00:49:21,256
And there is nothing you
can do about it, daywalker!

542
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:23,174
Is that so?

543
00:49:23,633 --> 00:49:26,303
Well, that's
what Frost says.

544
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:28,014
Then you won't mind me

545
00:49:28,431 --> 00:49:30,934
borrowing this
for a while, will you?

546
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:32,894
If he moves, fry him.

547
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:36,816
What's in here?

548
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:38,110
Nothing.
It's a... a storeroom.

549
00:49:38,611 --> 00:49:39,654
But you're
wasting your time.

550
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:41,739
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

551
00:49:42,198 --> 00:49:43,742
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

552
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:45,284
No!

553
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,274
He moved.

554
00:50:40,062 --> 00:50:42,273
What is this?

555
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:44,776
These are the pages

556
00:50:45,234 --> 00:50:47,155
from The Book
of Erebus,

557
00:50:47,572 --> 00:50:48,949
the Vampire Bible.

558
00:50:51,241 --> 00:50:53,955
It contains everything...

559
00:50:54,497 --> 00:50:55,873
their entire history.

560
00:50:57,125 --> 00:51:00,713
La Magra must be
one of their legends.

561
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:05,469
Why is Frost
so interested in La Magra?

562
00:51:06,012 --> 00:51:07,179
Shh!

563
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:45,977
Give me your hand.

564
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,817
Do you remember me?

565
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:11,468
QUINN: Give it to him!

566
00:52:27,404 --> 00:52:28,322
QUINN: Hey! Hey!

567
00:52:28,739 --> 00:52:30,490
Nice one.

568
00:52:30,908 --> 00:52:31,492
Heh.

569
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:32,619
Well, well, well.

570
00:52:33,077 --> 00:52:34,872
You took my arm, man.

571
00:52:35,372 --> 00:52:36,874
Remember?

572
00:52:37,332 --> 00:52:38,752
But it's cool.

573
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:41,213
I got a new one.

574
00:52:42,923 --> 00:52:44,592
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

575
00:52:46,637 --> 00:52:48,264
You can slice him,
you can dice him,

576
00:52:48,723 --> 00:52:50,350
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

577
00:52:50,809 --> 00:52:51,518
Check it out.

578
00:52:51,976 --> 00:52:53,770
I've got his pigsticker.

579
00:52:54,229 --> 00:52:55,564
Ah ha ha ha...

580
00:52:56,022 --> 00:52:56,732
Ohh! Aah!

581
00:52:57,232 --> 00:52:59,653
You're a fuck up, Crease!
Ha ha ha ha!

582
00:53:01,238 --> 00:53:02,031
You're a fuck up!

583
00:53:02,448 --> 00:53:03,658
"l got his pigsticker!"

584
00:53:04,117 --> 00:53:04,868
Ohh.

585
00:53:05,328 --> 00:53:07,328
You're just
full of surprises,

586
00:53:07,871 --> 00:53:09,164
isn't you, chief?

587
00:53:17,425 --> 00:53:19,427
Stay with me, sweetness...

588
00:53:19,802 --> 00:53:22,722
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

589
00:53:24,976 --> 00:53:26,810
Ah, looky here.

590
00:53:28,855 --> 00:53:30,358
Silver.

591
00:53:30,859 --> 00:53:32,026
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

592
00:53:32,485 --> 00:53:34,154
Probably cost you
a pretty penny.

593
00:53:34,571 --> 00:53:38,742
Now, this here is a man
who takes his job...

594
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,124
just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

595
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:49,715
Come to think of it, Blade,

596
00:53:50,132 --> 00:53:51,885
I owe you one.

597
00:53:56,224 --> 00:53:58,768
Actually, if you want
to get technical, Blade...

598
00:54:00,436 --> 00:54:01,812
I owe you two.

599
00:54:04,943 --> 00:54:07,028
Oh, what's so funny,
bright eyes?

600
00:54:10,282 --> 00:54:12,119
I'm expecting company.

601
00:54:27,678 --> 00:54:29,556
Catch you fuckers
at a bad time?

602
00:54:30,015 --> 00:54:31,266
No! No guns!

603
00:54:33,394 --> 00:54:34,855
No! No! No!

604
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:42,989
No! Fuckin' this way!

605
00:54:52,084 --> 00:54:53,253
Drop the guns!

606
00:54:53,712 --> 00:54:54,629
I need him!

607
00:54:55,130 --> 00:54:57,299
He wants Blade alive! Go!

608
00:55:01,804 --> 00:55:02,264
KAREN: You've been
listening in the whole time?

609
00:55:03,723 --> 00:55:04,683
Keeping
radio contact.

610
00:55:05,101 --> 00:55:07,980
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperon?

611
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:18,535
Christ!
I'm too old for this.

612
00:55:19,036 --> 00:55:21,205
Somebody get me
a god-damn wheelchair.

613
00:55:29,756 --> 00:55:30,842
Whistler!

614
00:55:31,259 --> 00:55:32,969
He can take care
of himself.

615
00:55:33,386 --> 00:55:34,388
Jump!

616
00:55:55,287 --> 00:55:57,332
Aah!

617
00:56:10,265 --> 00:56:11,641
QUINN: Aah!

618
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,049
Aah!

619
00:56:43,472 --> 00:56:45,267
Aah!

620
00:56:55,364 --> 00:56:57,074
What are you
gonna do?

621
00:56:58,158 --> 00:56:59,577
Oh, my God.

622
00:57:14,178 --> 00:57:15,721
What's wrong?

623
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,018
It's dislocated.

624
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,772
Ah!

625
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,606
Let me help you.

626
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,154
Aah!

627
00:57:35,246 --> 00:57:36,164
Let me give you...

628
00:57:36,666 --> 00:57:38,375
No! Get away.

629
00:57:54,103 --> 00:57:56,189
You're one of them,
aren't you?

630
00:57:59,067 --> 00:58:00,361
No.

631
00:58:00,861 --> 00:58:02,156
I'm something else.

632
00:58:09,998 --> 00:58:12,375
WHISTLER: I found him
when he was 13.

633
00:58:12,834 --> 00:58:14,337
He'd been livin'
on the streets,

634
00:58:14,838 --> 00:58:16,381
feedin' off
the homeless.

635
00:58:16,841 --> 00:58:19,300
His need for blood had
taken over at puberty.

636
00:58:19,842 --> 00:58:23,390
I took him
for a vampire at first.

637
00:58:23,891 --> 00:58:25,224
Almost killed him, too.

638
00:58:25,683 --> 00:58:28,313
Then I realized
what he was.

639
00:58:28,729 --> 00:58:31,482
Blade's mother was
attacked by a vampire

640
00:58:31,983 --> 00:58:33,318
while she was pregnant.

641
00:58:33,778 --> 00:58:36,281
She died, but he lived.

642
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,533
Unfortunately,

643
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:40,118
he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

644
00:58:40,577 --> 00:58:44,082
He can withstand
garlic, silver,

645
00:58:44,541 --> 00:58:45,666
even sunlight,

646
00:58:46,167 --> 00:58:47,670
and he's got
their strength.

647
00:58:48,754 --> 00:58:49,547
This time tomorrow,

648
00:58:50,048 --> 00:58:52,801
all those wounds of his
will be healed.

649
00:58:54,721 --> 00:58:56,848
He still ages
like a human, though.

650
00:58:57,349 --> 00:58:59,475
See, vampires
age slower than us.

651
00:58:59,893 --> 00:59:02,022
Unfortunately...

652
00:59:02,563 --> 00:59:05,442
he also inherited
their thirst.

653
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:09,447
I thought the serum was
supposed to suppress that.

654
00:59:09,905 --> 00:59:12,159
Time's runnin' out.

655
00:59:13,703 --> 00:59:16,664
His body's
startin' to reject it.

656
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:21,212
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

657
00:59:25,842 --> 00:59:27,677
Why do you hunt them?

658
00:59:29,846 --> 00:59:31,934
I had a family once...

659
00:59:32,393 --> 00:59:34,687
wife and two daughters.

660
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:39,400
Then a drifter came
callin' one evenin',

661
00:59:39,901 --> 00:59:40,902
a vampire.

662
00:59:43,031 --> 00:59:44,407
He toyed with 'em first,

663
00:59:44,783 --> 00:59:47,286
tried to make me decide

664
00:59:47,702 --> 00:59:49,414
which order
they'd die in.

665
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:56,130
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find,

666
00:59:56,631 --> 00:59:57,757
but it's gettin' worse.

667
00:59:58,216 --> 00:59:59,384
Because of Frost.

668
00:59:59,884 --> 01:00:00,469
There's somethin'
happenin'

669
01:00:00,504 --> 01:00:04,391
It's somethin' big...

670
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:06,225
and I'd stake my life

671
01:00:06,684 --> 01:00:10,230
that son of a bitch
is at the center of it.

672
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:14,988
KAREN: Blade.

673
01:00:32,885 --> 01:00:34,720
Whistler told me
what happened.

674
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:41,270
He told me
what you are.

675
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:45,859
You don't know me.

676
01:00:46,319 --> 01:00:48,236
You don't know
anything about me.

677
01:00:51,574 --> 01:00:53,535
I'm not human.

678
01:00:56,247 --> 01:00:57,499
You look human
to me...

679
01:00:57,958 --> 01:01:00,501
Humans don't
drink blood.

680
01:01:00,919 --> 01:01:02,046
That was
a long time ago.

681
01:01:02,546 --> 01:01:06,510
Maybe you should
let that go.

682
01:01:09,388 --> 01:01:10,932
I have spent
my whole life

683
01:01:11,350 --> 01:01:14,644
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

684
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,105
It made me what I am.

685
01:01:19,943 --> 01:01:23,531
And every time I take
one of those monsters out,

686
01:01:24,032 --> 01:01:26,493
I get a little piece
of that life back,

687
01:01:26,909 --> 01:01:30,414
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

688
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:35,379
...my fault he took us
by surprise!

689
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:37,674
Two of them against your
entire security force?

690
01:01:38,174 --> 01:01:40,177
Don't put that shit on me, OK,
'cause you were there, too!

691
01:01:40,677 --> 01:01:42,011
I'm sure Deacon
will appreciate...

692
01:01:42,429 --> 01:01:43,722
...stabbed in the balls
for it, all right?

693
01:01:44,265 --> 01:01:45,099
Aah! You little skeez!

694
01:01:45,557 --> 01:01:46,810
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

695
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:49,104
I should put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

696
01:01:49,605 --> 01:01:50,773
Face it, angel.
You were sloppy.

697
01:01:51,232 --> 01:01:53,068
You got
what you deserved.

698
01:01:56,072 --> 01:01:58,450
QUINN: Deac, let me
take this guy out, man.

699
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,285
Look. Look what
he fuckin' did!

700
01:02:00,785 --> 01:02:01,619
He took my hand again!

701
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:03,915
Listen to me.
I want him alive.

702
01:02:04,332 --> 01:02:05,917
What the fuck
are you talk...

703
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,502
you want him alive?

704
01:02:08,003 --> 01:02:10,047
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

705
01:02:10,548 --> 01:02:12,633
Are you out of
your fuckin' mind? Shh.

706
01:02:13,134 --> 01:02:14,560
Big guy, relax.

707
01:02:14,595 --> 01:02:15,554

Be patient.

709
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:22,186
Now, we got a lot
to do here.

710
01:02:22,688 --> 01:02:23,606
I need you, man.

711
01:02:24,106 --> 01:02:25,316
Heh.

712
01:02:25,859 --> 01:02:26,859
Heh.

713
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:28,612
I need you.

714
01:02:29,113 --> 01:02:30,114
Yeah.

715
01:03:13,376 --> 01:03:15,004
Morning.

716
01:03:15,379 --> 01:03:17,004
How you feelin'?

717
01:03:26,435 --> 01:03:27,436
Look at that.

718
01:03:31,690 --> 01:03:33,902
Whew. Gettin' a little
toasty out here, huh?

719
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:34,944
Heh heh.

720
01:03:36,488 --> 01:03:37,574
When was the last time

721
01:03:38,032 --> 01:03:40,368
you stopped to appreciate
a good sunrise?

722
01:03:40,910 --> 01:03:42,746
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire,

723
01:03:43,247 --> 01:03:45,373
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

724
01:03:45,832 --> 01:03:46,375
That's OK.

725
01:03:46,876 --> 01:03:47,501
It's all right.

726
01:03:48,002 --> 01:03:49,088
Least we're here together.

727
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:50,464
Share the moment,

728
01:03:50,923 --> 01:03:53,634
which means a lotto me,
by the way, really.

729
01:03:54,093 --> 01:03:55,514
I mean that.

730
01:03:57,389 --> 01:03:59,933
'Cause actually, you know,
when you get to know me,

731
01:04:00,350 --> 01:04:02,416
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

732
01:04:02,451 --> 01:04:04,481
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

733
01:04:07,903 --> 01:04:10,447
Do what you want,
Frost.

734
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:12,825
Doesn't make
any difference.

735
01:04:14,203 --> 01:04:17,205
You just don't
fuckin' get it.

736
01:04:18,499 --> 01:04:19,625
You're never
gonna be a pureblood.

737
01:04:20,042 --> 01:04:21,462
Hold him.

738
01:04:24,046 --> 01:04:26,133
You will never rule us.

739
01:04:27,761 --> 01:04:29,638
Aah!

740
01:04:33,394 --> 01:04:34,562
Aah!

741
01:04:37,647 --> 01:04:38,482
Ow.

742
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:40,569
Jesus Christ.

743
01:04:40,944 --> 01:04:41,736
Have a nice day.

744
01:04:42,195 --> 01:04:43,154
Sorry, you old dog.

745
01:04:43,613 --> 01:04:46,285
You just got a little
too long in the tooth.

746
01:04:47,827 --> 01:04:49,746
What, man?
That was funny.

747
01:04:50,163 --> 01:04:51,415
"Long, tooth."
Funny.

748
01:04:51,915 --> 01:04:54,210
Did I tell you
the one about...

749
01:04:56,504 --> 01:04:58,131
Aah!

750
01:05:23,956 --> 01:05:25,958
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

751
01:05:33,049 --> 01:05:35,344
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

752
01:05:35,803 --> 01:05:38,933
I need 12 volunteers.
Tkktkk.

753
01:05:44,981 --> 01:05:45,941
Whistler.

754
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:50,488
What is this?

755
01:05:52,324 --> 01:05:54,535
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

756
01:05:54,952 --> 01:05:56,163
I took it
from the archives.

757
01:05:56,705 --> 01:05:57,748
It's written in blood.

758
01:05:58,206 --> 01:06:00,709
It's from
The Book of Erebus.

759
01:06:04,924 --> 01:06:07,301
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

760
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:09,555
It's somethin'
about the Blood God,

761
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:11,349
the spirits of the 12.

762
01:06:11,848 --> 01:06:12,473
I... I don't know.

763
01:06:12,932 --> 01:06:14,268
I can't make out
the rest of it.

764
01:06:14,686 --> 01:06:15,937
Maybe this'll help.

765
01:06:17,021 --> 01:06:18,399
I'll figure out something.

766
01:06:19,983 --> 01:06:21,278
So what's all this?

767
01:06:21,736 --> 01:06:23,906
Took a trip to
the hospital last night,

768
01:06:24,406 --> 01:06:25,865
borrowed some equipment.

769
01:06:26,366 --> 01:06:28,996
For your
miracle cure?

770
01:06:30,914 --> 01:06:31,832
This is E.D.T.A.

771
01:06:32,291 --> 01:06:32,957
It's an anticoagulant.

772
01:06:33,418 --> 01:06:35,462
We use it
to treat blood clots.

773
01:06:35,963 --> 01:06:38,839
Now look what happens
when I introduce it

774
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:41,761
onto a sample
of vampire blood.

775
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,514
Take a step back.

776
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:46,517
The reaction's
energetic.

777
01:06:56,028 --> 01:06:56,696
Some cure.

778
01:06:57,154 --> 01:06:59,617
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
Was a cure.

779
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,619
But maybe
you could use it

780
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:04,289
to explode
some vampire heads.

781
01:07:06,751 --> 01:07:07,376
Wait a minute.

782
01:07:07,751 --> 01:07:09,545
I need a sample
of your blood.

783
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:10,755
Later.

784
01:07:11,172 --> 01:07:13,009
Gotta go downtown.

785
01:07:13,468 --> 01:07:14,261
Need some serum.

786
01:07:14,719 --> 01:07:15,678
Serum can wait.

787
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,682
This is important.

788
01:07:39,875 --> 01:07:41,209
Is he sick?

789
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:42,712
Cancer.

790
01:07:45,007 --> 01:07:47,675
You have a lot of love
for him, don't you?

791
01:07:48,176 --> 01:07:50,013
We have
a good arrangement.

792
01:07:50,388 --> 01:07:52,974
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

793
01:07:57,064 --> 01:07:58,815
You know,
my mother used to say,

794
01:07:59,316 --> 01:08:01,569
"A cold heart
is a dead heart."

795
01:08:19,674 --> 01:08:21,178
You don't look so good.

796
01:08:22,261 --> 01:08:23,596
I'm just a little tired.

797
01:08:24,014 --> 01:08:25,181
You know we've been...

798
01:08:25,724 --> 01:08:27,018
workin' all night.

799
01:08:29,687 --> 01:08:32,063
I guess we didn't
catch it in time.

800
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:34,819
You got another day,

801
01:08:35,278 --> 01:08:37,029
two at the most.

802
01:08:41,910 --> 01:08:43,829
For what it's worth,
I'm sorry.

803
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:47,417
You make it sound
like I'm already dead.

804
01:09:05,525 --> 01:09:06,525
Blade.

805
01:09:32,015 --> 01:09:33,558
How you doin', chief?

806
01:09:34,935 --> 01:09:35,561
Easy.

807
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,148
Wouldn't want
our little friend here

808
01:09:39,690 --> 01:09:42,654
to wind up on the back of
a milk carton, now would we?

809
01:09:44,071 --> 01:09:47,117
Ah, it's nice
to finally meet you, man.

810
01:09:47,535 --> 01:09:49,495
Had my eye on you
for years.

811
01:09:50,037 --> 01:09:51,163
I know all about you...

812
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:54,126
your serum, Whistler...
Everything.

813
01:09:54,584 --> 01:09:56,379
Sunblock.

814
01:09:56,754 --> 01:09:58,506
Hey, it's a start, right?

815
01:09:58,883 --> 01:10:01,511
The goal, of course,
is to be like you,

816
01:10:01,927 --> 01:10:02,595
the daywalker.

817
01:10:04,054 --> 01:10:06,183
You got the best
of both worlds, don't you?

818
01:10:06,724 --> 01:10:08,895
All our strengths...

819
01:10:09,354 --> 01:10:10,271
none of our weaknesses.

820
01:10:10,731 --> 01:10:13,399
Well, maybe I don't
see it that way.

821
01:10:13,901 --> 01:10:16,445
Oh, so it's back
to pretending we're human again?

822
01:10:16,904 --> 01:10:20,240
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

823
01:10:20,700 --> 01:10:23,496
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

824
01:10:23,914 --> 01:10:24,998
Heh. You think the humans

825
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:27,417
will ever accept
a half-breed like you?

826
01:10:27,876 --> 01:10:29,753
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

827
01:10:31,296 --> 01:10:32,547
And they should be.

828
01:10:33,050 --> 01:10:33,592
You're an animal.

829
01:10:34,092 --> 01:10:36,095
You're a fuckin'
maniac.

830
01:10:39,057 --> 01:10:40,225
Look at 'em.

831
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,520
They're cattle,

832
01:10:42,936 --> 01:10:44,479
pieces of meat.

833
01:10:44,938 --> 01:10:47,567
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

834
01:10:47,985 --> 01:10:48,611
Plague...

835
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:50,070
war...

836
01:10:50,612 --> 01:10:51,738
famine.

837
01:10:52,198 --> 01:10:54,159
Morality doesn't even
enter into it.

838
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:57,203
We're just a function
of natural selection, man,

839
01:10:57,705 --> 01:10:59,666
the new race.

840
01:11:01,293 --> 01:11:03,879
Looks like
your mascara's running.

841
01:11:11,055 --> 01:11:12,974
I'm offering you a truce.

842
01:11:13,433 --> 01:11:14,684
I want you with us.

843
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:17,020
What do you think,
I'm stupid?

844
01:11:25,574 --> 01:11:27,116
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

845
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:29,954
Frost...

846
01:11:30,371 --> 01:11:32,582
you're nothing
to me...

847
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:35,586
but another
dead vampire.

848
01:11:36,087 --> 01:11:37,630
You're an idiot.
You know that?

849
01:11:38,089 --> 01:11:40,717
I came down here
offering you an easy way out,

850
01:11:41,176 --> 01:11:44,180
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

851
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,849
Careful.

852
01:11:50,354 --> 01:11:52,690
What do I care?

853
01:11:53,190 --> 01:11:55,110
They're nothing
but cattle...

854
01:11:55,569 --> 01:11:56,945
just like you said.

855
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:59,907
If you want to take
the hard road, be my guest, pal,

856
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:01,954
but I promise you
by the time this is over,

857
01:12:02,496 --> 01:12:06,373
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's...

858
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:17,263
aah!

859
01:12:41,293 --> 01:12:42,503
Go home.

860
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:46,674
It was simple.

861
01:12:47,133 --> 01:12:49,094
Why do vampires
need to drink blood?

862
01:12:49,553 --> 01:12:51,555
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

863
01:12:51,973 --> 01:12:53,391
Right. So it's
a genetic defect,

864
01:12:53,892 --> 01:12:54,601
just like
haemolytic anaemia.

865
01:12:55,059 --> 01:12:57,146
That means that
we have to treat it

866
01:12:57,604 --> 01:12:58,439
with gene therapy,

867
01:12:58,982 --> 01:13:00,983
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

868
01:13:01,233 --> 01:13:02,402
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

869
01:13:03,945 --> 01:13:05,031
Are you sure
that's safe?

870
01:13:05,490 --> 01:13:06,532
I have no idea,

871
01:13:06,991 --> 01:13:09,411
but I don't have
a choice, do l?

872
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,915
You actually think
this could work?

873
01:13:13,415 --> 01:13:14,917
On me...

874
01:13:15,377 --> 01:13:16,670
yes.

875
01:13:17,129 --> 01:13:19,214
On Blade,
I'm not so sure.

876
01:13:19,799 --> 01:13:21,008
See, he didn't
contract vampirism

877
01:13:21,425 --> 01:13:22,886
from a bite
like I did.

878
01:13:23,303 --> 01:13:24,473
He was born with it.

879
01:13:24,931 --> 01:13:26,640
It's... it's part
of his DNA.

880
01:13:27,099 --> 01:13:29,560
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst,

881
01:13:30,062 --> 01:13:31,271
but it's gonna
take time.

882
01:13:31,730 --> 01:13:33,691
Ah, we're out of time.

883
01:13:34,192 --> 01:13:36,487
You saw what was
on that disc.

884
01:13:41,242 --> 01:13:42,661
Damn.

885
01:13:44,747 --> 01:13:45,830
Get out of here.

886
01:14:10,736 --> 01:14:12,948
I said get out of here!

887
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,581
Nice place.

888
01:14:20,166 --> 01:14:22,377
Took us a while
to find it!

889
01:14:29,595 --> 01:14:31,180
Bite me
and get it over with.

890
01:14:31,639 --> 01:14:33,432
I ain't gonna bite you.

891
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:47,784
Do your thing.

892
01:15:00,258 --> 01:15:01,467
Whistler.

893
01:16:09,219 --> 01:16:11,554
Frost took her.

894
01:16:19,397 --> 01:16:20,775
Listen to me.

895
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:24,946
The disc.

896
01:16:26,408 --> 01:16:27,534
He decoded it.

897
01:16:28,034 --> 01:16:30,661
Frost is trying to...

898
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:34,542
trigger a fuckin'
vampire apocalypse.

899
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:38,713
There's some kind of...

900
01:16:39,173 --> 01:16:42,343
Vampire God he's trying
to resurrect.

901
01:16:43,969 --> 01:16:45,556
La Magra.

902
01:16:48,934 --> 01:16:50,644
You're the key.

903
01:16:52,106 --> 01:16:53,816
He needs
your blood.

904
01:16:57,737 --> 01:16:59,824
The blood
of the daywalker.

905
01:17:02,408 --> 01:17:05,038
You're the chosen one.

906
01:17:08,625 --> 01:17:09,919
Listen to me, Blade.

907
01:17:11,463 --> 01:17:12,965
You can't
go after him.

908
01:17:13,423 --> 01:17:14,716
Bullshit.

909
01:17:15,259 --> 01:17:17,012
If Frost gets
his hands on you,

910
01:17:17,512 --> 01:17:19,931
it's all over.

911
01:17:22,852 --> 01:17:25,564
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

912
01:17:28,359 --> 01:17:29,318
Shit.

913
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,701
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

914
01:17:36,161 --> 01:17:39,497
Don't want me
coming back.

915
01:17:41,417 --> 01:17:43,210
We can treat
the wounds.

916
01:17:45,004 --> 01:17:46,298
It's too far gone.

917
01:17:46,757 --> 01:17:49,010
You know that.

918
01:17:52,305 --> 01:17:54,976
Give me your gun.

919
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,936
No.

920
01:17:59,188 --> 01:18:01,817
Give me
the god-damn gun.

921
01:18:26,848 --> 01:18:27,849
Now walk away,

922
01:18:28,308 --> 01:18:30,602
you stupid
son of a bitch.

923
01:18:35,442 --> 01:18:37,820
Walk the fuck away.

924
01:18:58,722 --> 01:18:59,639
By the time you watch this,

925
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:01,350
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

926
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:02,310
If it makes any
difference to you,

927
01:19:02,853 --> 01:19:05,062
he put up
quite a fight.

928
01:19:05,520 --> 01:19:08,191
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

929
01:20:46,439 --> 01:20:47,440
You seem a bit...

930
01:20:47,899 --> 01:20:48,566
tense.

931
01:20:49,025 --> 01:20:50,610
A bit pent-up maybe,

932
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,571
like you need to
release something.

933
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:54,406
You know?

934
01:20:54,783 --> 01:20:55,866
Blade not...

935
01:20:57,161 --> 01:20:59,372
givin' it to you
maybe.

936
01:21:00,582 --> 01:21:01,457
I don't know.
I just...

937
01:21:02,042 --> 01:21:05,005
I see such
a beautiful woman.

938
01:21:06,714 --> 01:21:07,966
Great skin.

939
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,514
I'd like to see you
happy, that's all.

940
01:21:12,930 --> 01:21:16,143
Is this the part where
you offer to turn me?

941
01:21:17,646 --> 01:21:19,771
Well, it's either that
or a body bag.

942
01:21:20,147 --> 01:21:21,523
Go ahead.

943
01:21:21,983 --> 01:21:23,026
Bite me.

944
01:21:23,527 --> 01:21:26,072
I'll just cure myself.

945
01:21:26,655 --> 01:21:27,573
I did it before,

946
01:21:28,074 --> 01:21:29,284
and I can do it again.

947
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:31,163
There is no cure,
baby.

948
01:21:31,621 --> 01:21:32,789
There is if you've
been bit,

949
01:21:33,246 --> 01:21:36,501
if you were once human.

950
01:21:41,925 --> 01:21:42,927
How'd you get
that scar, Deacon?

951
01:21:43,344 --> 01:21:44,387
A born vampire

952
01:21:44,803 --> 01:21:47,180
would have the power
to regenerate from birth.

953
01:21:47,682 --> 01:21:50,435
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

954
01:21:50,935 --> 01:21:51,853
Isn't that right?

955
01:21:52,311 --> 01:21:55,317
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

956
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:58,487
You're just... infected,
a virus...

957
01:21:58,988 --> 01:22:00,656
a sexually transmitted
disease.

958
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,200
I'll tell you
what we are, sister.

959
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:04,744
We're the top of
the fuckin' food chain.

960
01:22:05,245 --> 01:22:06,872
The Blood God's coming.
And after tonight,

961
01:22:07,374 --> 01:22:08,792
you people
are fuckin' history.

962
01:22:10,502 --> 01:22:11,587
He's a hurricane,

963
01:22:12,046 --> 01:22:13,756
an act of God.

964
01:22:14,131 --> 01:22:15,550
Anyone caught
in his path

965
01:22:16,009 --> 01:22:17,093
will instantly
be turned.

966
01:22:19,012 --> 01:22:20,348
Everyone you've
ever known,

967
01:22:20,848 --> 01:22:23,560
everyone you've ever
fucking loved.

968
01:22:24,062 --> 01:22:25,520
It won't matter
who's pureblood

969
01:22:26,104 --> 01:22:27,273
and who's not.

970
01:22:27,689 --> 01:22:30,319
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

971
01:22:32,029 --> 01:22:33,572
Hmm?

972
01:22:37,119 --> 01:22:39,122
And Blade's blood
is the key.

973
01:22:39,664 --> 01:22:41,249
We got an intruder.

974
01:23:10,369 --> 01:23:11,287
Deac, I don't think
you understand.

975
01:23:11,703 --> 01:23:12,621
I mean, this dude
is fuckin' bad. What?

976
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,749
He's, like, he had
20 guys around him...

977
01:23:15,208 --> 01:23:16,584
and he's got shit
he throws at you...

978
01:23:17,043 --> 01:23:18,253
Yeah, the swords.

979
01:23:18,713 --> 01:23:19,631
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

980
01:23:20,006 --> 01:23:21,340
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

981
01:23:21,799 --> 01:23:22,800
There's no
intruder where we are.

982
01:23:23,260 --> 01:23:24,677
Look, make it happen,
all right?

983
01:23:25,095 --> 01:23:26,263
It's one guy on foot.

984
01:23:30,935 --> 01:23:32,521
That's him!
Get him!

985
01:23:52,045 --> 01:23:53,671
Why am I hearing
gunfire? Huh?

986
01:23:54,005 --> 01:23:56,426
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

987
01:23:56,885 --> 01:23:57,929
I need him alive.

988
01:23:58,262 --> 01:23:59,430
No!

989
01:24:02,058 --> 01:24:04,018
Please!

990
01:24:04,477 --> 01:24:05,603
I just work for them!

991
01:24:07,941 --> 01:24:09,443
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

992
01:24:09,902 --> 01:24:10,903
Yes, sir!

993
01:24:47,739 --> 01:24:49,909
Aah!

994
01:24:50,368 --> 01:24:52,496
Aieee!
Aah!

995
01:25:58,244 --> 01:25:59,913
Eric?

996
01:26:11,135 --> 01:26:12,679
But you died.

997
01:26:14,056 --> 01:26:16,100
I came back, Eric.

998
01:26:16,559 --> 01:26:17,894
That very same night...

999
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:22,148
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

1000
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:32,036
Uhh!

1001
01:26:39,171 --> 01:26:41,715
Jesus Christ. I thought
you'd be happy.

1002
01:26:42,174 --> 01:26:43,217
You're finally being
reunited with your mother,

1003
01:26:43,676 --> 01:26:44,970
and you act like this?

1004
01:26:46,763 --> 01:26:48,682
Blade, give it up.
It's over.

1005
01:26:49,099 --> 01:26:50,852
She belongs to me,
buddy.

1006
01:26:51,227 --> 01:26:52,312
Uh! Uhh!

1007
01:26:54,231 --> 01:26:55,357
Don't look so surprised.

1008
01:26:55,816 --> 01:26:57,067
You spent your whole life

1009
01:26:57,652 --> 01:27:00,029
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

1010
01:27:00,488 --> 01:27:02,407
Well, here I am.

1011
01:27:04,702 --> 01:27:05,619
Who would ever guess

1012
01:27:06,078 --> 01:27:08,166
you'd survive
your mother's death?

1013
01:27:08,666 --> 01:27:09,583
But you did.

1014
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,211
And here we are...

1015
01:27:11,669 --> 01:27:14,047
one big happy
fuckin' family.

1016
01:27:25,478 --> 01:27:27,147
I need my serum.

1017
01:27:29,901 --> 01:27:30,818
Maybe when we
get outta this,

1018
01:27:31,236 --> 01:27:33,072
I'll take that
miracle cure of yours.

1019
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:35,115
There's one catch.

1020
01:27:39,077 --> 01:27:40,621
If it works,

1021
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:41,998
you'll lose
your strength

1022
01:27:42,457 --> 01:27:46,462
and your ability
to regenerate.

1023
01:27:46,921 --> 01:27:48,883
You'll be
completely human.

1024
01:28:10,117 --> 01:28:11,118
Uhh!

1025
01:28:50,833 --> 01:28:53,172
FROST: Blade, Karen,

1026
01:28:53,588 --> 01:28:55,173
glad you could make it.

1027
01:28:55,632 --> 01:28:57,928
Hey, man. Thanks
for the shades.

1028
01:28:59,262 --> 01:29:01,347
Our ancestors
called this place

1029
01:29:01,764 --> 01:29:04,018
the Temple
of Eternal Night.

1030
01:29:07,147 --> 01:29:08,689
Nice, isn't it?

1031
01:29:09,065 --> 01:29:11,569
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

1032
01:29:12,111 --> 01:29:14,404
Fortunately for us...

1033
01:29:14,906 --> 01:29:15,908
I'm what you
might call a...

1034
01:29:16,324 --> 01:29:18,870
student of history.

1035
01:29:32,219 --> 01:29:34,263
Why are we here?

1036
01:29:35,850 --> 01:29:39,895
This temple was built
for one glorious moment...

1037
01:29:40,354 --> 01:29:43,692
this night,
for the Blood God.

1038
01:29:51,952 --> 01:29:53,204
Thanks.

1039
01:29:58,543 --> 01:30:00,088
Let's see
this sword of yours.

1040
01:30:02,592 --> 01:30:04,760
Well.

1041
01:30:05,178 --> 01:30:05,887
Titanium, right?

1042
01:30:06,387 --> 01:30:08,306
Acid-etched?

1043
01:30:10,183 --> 01:30:12,853
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

1044
01:30:18,611 --> 01:30:19,236
What?

1045
01:30:19,738 --> 01:30:22,156
You look surprised.

1046
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:23,908
I told you, Blade,

1047
01:30:24,201 --> 01:30:26,203
I know everything
about you.

1048
01:30:27,288 --> 01:30:28,415
Hold out your arm,
Quinn.

1049
01:30:28,873 --> 01:30:29,666
Why, man?

1050
01:30:30,042 --> 01:30:30,750
These are... they're,
like, all better.

1051
01:30:31,168 --> 01:30:32,086
Hold out your arm.

1052
01:30:32,545 --> 01:30:33,547
Now.

1053
01:30:37,593 --> 01:30:38,636
Deac, l...

1054
01:30:43,892 --> 01:30:44,894
Just kidding.

1055
01:30:47,104 --> 01:30:48,773
Ha ha ha ha! He was fuckin' with me.

1056
01:30:49,191 --> 01:30:50,483
He was, like,
fuckin'...

1057
01:30:51,026 --> 01:30:51,568
Blade.

1058
01:30:52,069 --> 01:30:53,988
Blade.

1059
01:30:54,448 --> 01:30:55,156
He can't hear you,
honey.

1060
01:30:55,532 --> 01:30:57,159
The thirst has
got him now.

1061
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,668
What do we have here?

1062
01:31:05,127 --> 01:31:07,547
The precious serum.

1063
01:31:07,922 --> 01:31:11,386
Mm. How long's it been
since you shot up?

1064
01:31:11,844 --> 01:31:14,223
12, 13 hours maybe?

1065
01:31:14,723 --> 01:31:16,558
I bet you're just
dying for a drink,

1066
01:31:17,100 --> 01:31:18,227
aren't you?

1067
01:31:20,730 --> 01:31:21,939
What's it feel like?

1068
01:31:23,942 --> 01:31:25,487
Is your blood on fire?

1069
01:31:25,903 --> 01:31:27,906
Try some.

1070
01:31:28,406 --> 01:31:30,658
You might like it.

1071
01:31:31,076 --> 01:31:33,121
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

1072
01:31:33,662 --> 01:31:35,499
In any event,

1073
01:31:35,999 --> 01:31:38,044
I don't think you'll be
needing these any more.

1074
01:31:45,468 --> 01:31:46,887
It's a shame, you know?

1075
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:49,473
When I think of what
you've become,

1076
01:31:49,892 --> 01:31:52,186
what you should
have become.

1077
01:31:52,644 --> 01:31:54,273
I guess
I don't blame you.

1078
01:31:54,689 --> 01:31:56,024
I mean, with everything
that's happened,

1079
01:31:56,567 --> 01:31:57,525
it's the human
side of you

1080
01:31:57,984 --> 01:31:59,235
that's made you weak.

1081
01:31:59,778 --> 01:32:00,946
You should've listened
to your blood.

1082
01:32:01,405 --> 01:32:02,325
Say what you want,

1083
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:06,536
but I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

1084
01:32:07,080 --> 01:32:08,248
Ooh.

1085
01:32:10,708 --> 01:32:12,668
Get him outta here.

1086
01:32:17,092 --> 01:32:19,094
Get these fucks
downstairs. Now.

1087
01:32:19,595 --> 01:32:20,972
Come on. Let's go.

1088
01:32:21,515 --> 01:32:23,183
Let's go.

1089
01:32:27,188 --> 01:32:28,106
Don't worry,
sweetheart.

1090
01:32:28,606 --> 01:32:29,316
We haven't
forgotten about you.

1091
01:32:29,775 --> 01:32:30,692
QUINN: Oh, no, baby.

1092
01:32:31,151 --> 01:32:34,114
We got something real
special planned for you.

1093
01:32:35,365 --> 01:32:36,657
QUINN: That surfer boy
had a nice ass.

1094
01:32:37,158 --> 01:32:38,076
I sucked him dry.

1095
01:32:38,493 --> 01:32:39,870
And you'd figure
he'd turn, man.

1096
01:32:40,371 --> 01:32:41,246
Yeah, but he didn't
turn, did he?

1097
01:32:41,748 --> 01:32:42,706
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

1098
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:44,625
It happens
sometimes, cutie.

1099
01:32:46,587 --> 01:32:47,213
He was fuckin'
tripped out.

1100
01:32:47,713 --> 01:32:48,673
FROST: Pathetic.

1101
01:32:49,090 --> 01:32:50,757
QUINN: Yeah. These guys
are complete scums, man.

1102
01:32:51,217 --> 01:32:52,135
They'll eat anything...

1103
01:32:52,594 --> 01:32:56,264
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

1104
01:32:57,644 --> 01:32:58,603
They'll even
eat vampires.

1105
01:32:59,145 --> 01:33:00,313
That's a plus.

1106
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:01,773
And bearing that
all in mind,

1107
01:33:02,273 --> 01:33:04,108
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

1108
01:33:05,861 --> 01:33:07,070
Uh!

1109
01:33:08,822 --> 01:33:09,782
Uh!

1110
01:33:10,242 --> 01:33:10,909
It's too bad.

1111
01:33:11,368 --> 01:33:13,788
I kinda liked her.

1112
01:33:14,163 --> 01:33:15,330
What a waste.

1113
01:33:37,108 --> 01:33:38,985
I don't know what's
happening to me.

1114
01:33:40,236 --> 01:33:41,698
No pulse.

1115
01:33:42,198 --> 01:33:43,034
And, of course,

1116
01:33:43,492 --> 01:33:45,284
there's the question
of lividity.

1117
01:33:47,120 --> 01:33:48,331
Curtis?

1118
01:33:50,416 --> 01:33:51,709
Ahh.

1119
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:54,004
Karen?

1120
01:33:55,173 --> 01:33:56,215
Karen.

1121
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:59,678
I never thought
I would see you again.

1122
01:34:00,137 --> 01:34:01,639
Tell me, Karen,

1123
01:34:02,098 --> 01:34:04,141
do you ever have
second thoughts about us?

1124
01:34:22,456 --> 01:34:23,792
Karen!

1125
01:34:24,208 --> 01:34:26,170
Karen!

1126
01:34:26,670 --> 01:34:27,880
Karen!

1127
01:34:29,172 --> 01:34:31,217
Karen!

1128
01:34:31,676 --> 01:34:32,970
Karen.

1129
01:34:33,387 --> 01:34:35,430
Karen!

1130
01:35:40,428 --> 01:35:41,973
Poor child.

1131
01:35:43,808 --> 01:35:45,310
You're so sick.

1132
01:35:46,727 --> 01:35:48,480
So thirsty.

1133
01:35:48,938 --> 01:35:51,192
Don't touch me.

1134
01:35:53,736 --> 01:35:56,240
Eric, look at me.

1135
01:35:56,741 --> 01:35:58,994
Vampires are
my people now.

1136
01:35:59,494 --> 01:36:01,830
I'm one of them.

1137
01:36:02,206 --> 01:36:02,582
Can't be.

1138
01:36:05,126 --> 01:36:06,879
Yes, it can.

1139
01:36:09,257 --> 01:36:11,717
Try to understand,
Eric.

1140
01:36:12,886 --> 01:36:16,098
Your mother died
a long time ago.

1141
01:36:18,559 --> 01:36:19,894
I've hunted...

1142
01:36:21,605 --> 01:36:23,065
I've killed...

1143
01:36:25,443 --> 01:36:27,237
and I've enjoyed it.

1144
01:36:28,988 --> 01:36:30,157
Haven't you?

1145
01:36:31,908 --> 01:36:33,328
I know you have.

1146
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:36,749
Sooner or later,

1147
01:36:37,290 --> 01:36:39,336
the thirst
always wins.

1148
01:37:23,724 --> 01:37:24,934
Come on.

1149
01:37:31,692 --> 01:37:32,861
Spread them out.

1150
01:37:34,112 --> 01:37:36,615
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

1151
01:37:37,074 --> 01:37:38,825
Make it perfect.

1152
01:38:16,956 --> 01:38:18,251
Yeah.

1153
01:38:19,460 --> 01:38:21,170
FROST:
Bring the elevator up.

1154
01:39:00,594 --> 01:39:02,639
VAMPIRE:
You stupid girl.

1155
01:39:04,309 --> 01:39:04,850
La Magra?

1156
01:39:05,309 --> 01:39:06,226
The Blood God?

1157
01:39:06,644 --> 01:39:07,855
That's nothing more
than a fairy tale

1158
01:39:08,355 --> 01:39:10,024
for pretty
little vampires.

1159
01:39:10,482 --> 01:39:11,316
Then why are you
sweating, pureblood?

1160
01:39:11,775 --> 01:39:15,238
You're afraid we're
gonna steal your soul,

1161
01:39:15,697 --> 01:39:17,824
your pureblood spirit.

1162
01:39:18,283 --> 01:39:19,869
You should be.

1163
01:39:20,328 --> 01:39:21,579
Read the prophecy.

1164
01:39:22,038 --> 01:39:23,039
It's time you fucks

1165
01:39:23,457 --> 01:39:25,208
contributed something
to the cause.

1166
01:39:29,172 --> 01:39:30,382
SECOND VAMPIRE: Even
if Frost is right,

1167
01:39:30,799 --> 01:39:33,553
you really think
he cares about you?

1168
01:39:33,928 --> 01:39:34,762
You're gonna die,

1169
01:39:35,222 --> 01:39:36,514
just like
the rest of us.

1170
01:39:36,931 --> 01:39:37,933
Waah!

1171
01:40:02,047 --> 01:40:03,132
Blade.

1172
01:40:12,433 --> 01:40:15,689
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

1173
01:40:16,232 --> 01:40:17,398
No more compromises.

1174
01:40:17,857 --> 01:40:20,152
We're gonna be gods.

1175
01:40:21,779 --> 01:40:22,614
Of course we are.

1176
01:40:23,030 --> 01:40:25,910
Yeah!

1177
01:40:26,369 --> 01:40:27,412
I'm gonna be naughty.

1178
01:40:27,830 --> 01:40:29,748
I'm gonna be a naughty
Vampire God.

1179
01:40:30,124 --> 01:40:31,124
Ha ha ha!

1180
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,761
Gotta stop...

1181
01:40:41,429 --> 01:40:42,471
stop...

1182
01:40:42,889 --> 01:40:44,640
Save your strength.

1183
01:40:45,141 --> 01:40:46,101
Blue.

1184
01:40:47,478 --> 01:40:48,854
You're hypovolemic.

1185
01:40:49,314 --> 01:40:50,439
You're bleeding
to death.

1186
01:40:50,899 --> 01:40:52,484
Need...

1187
01:40:52,943 --> 01:40:53,778
serum.

1188
01:41:12,092 --> 01:41:13,094
Blade.

1189
01:41:14,928 --> 01:41:16,890
Blade.

1190
01:41:19,143 --> 01:41:20,227
Listen to me.

1191
01:41:21,937 --> 01:41:24,275
I want you to take
some of my blood.

1192
01:41:26,109 --> 01:41:27,485
No.

1193
01:41:29,823 --> 01:41:30,991
No.

1194
01:41:32,159 --> 01:41:34,495
Look, just do it.

1195
01:42:00,195 --> 01:42:01,279
Is everybody thirsty?

1196
01:42:01,738 --> 01:42:05,200
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

1197
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:25,935
KAREN: Ohh...

1198
01:42:26,435 --> 01:42:27,561
don't stop.

1199
01:42:30,732 --> 01:42:31,817
Don't stop.

1200
01:42:37,156 --> 01:42:38,200
Don't stop.

1201
01:42:52,842 --> 01:42:54,261
Don't stop.

1202
01:43:07,194 --> 01:43:09,237
Aah!

1203
01:43:46,409 --> 01:43:48,079
How was it?

1204
01:43:49,371 --> 01:43:50,457
Aah!

1205
01:43:56,297 --> 01:43:58,633
Aah!

1206
01:43:59,133 --> 01:44:00,636
Aah!

1207
01:44:01,137 --> 01:44:02,890
Aah!

1208
01:44:09,771 --> 01:44:11,608
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1209
01:44:14,277 --> 01:44:16,406
Uhh!

1210
01:44:23,747 --> 01:44:25,207
Aah!

1211
01:44:47,445 --> 01:44:49,070
Aah!

1212
01:44:53,326 --> 01:44:54,452
Aah!

1213
01:44:59,084 --> 01:45:00,461
Eric...

1214
01:45:01,544 --> 01:45:03,130
I'm your mother.

1215
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:07,803
You wouldn't hurt
your mother...

1216
01:45:08,303 --> 01:45:09,304
would you?

1217
01:45:12,058 --> 01:45:13,101
Come here.

1218
01:45:17,607 --> 01:45:19,776
I must release you.

1219
01:45:30,748 --> 01:45:31,708
Fuck!

1220
01:45:33,292 --> 01:45:35,380
Aah!

1221
01:45:50,397 --> 01:45:51,399
Aah!

1222
01:45:58,281 --> 01:45:59,282
Aah!

1223
01:46:28,986 --> 01:46:29,779
Uhh!

1224
01:46:30,281 --> 01:46:31,658
Unh!

1225
01:46:32,117 --> 01:46:33,117
Unh!

1226
01:46:36,788 --> 01:46:37,747
Deacon?

1227
01:46:38,166 --> 01:46:39,292
Not anymore.

1228
01:46:55,312 --> 01:46:56,940
Frost!

1229
01:46:57,440 --> 01:46:58,066
Kill him.

1230
01:46:58,608 --> 01:47:00,192
Wait! I owe you, man.

1231
01:47:00,693 --> 01:47:02,112
I got two new hands, Blade.

1232
01:47:02,613 --> 01:47:04,948
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with!

1233
01:47:05,365 --> 01:47:06,825
Aah!

1234
01:47:19,341 --> 01:47:21,595
Yaah!

1235
01:47:25,307 --> 01:47:27,143
Frost.

1236
01:47:29,230 --> 01:47:30,563
Yaah!

1237
01:47:44,289 --> 01:47:46,208
I got struck
by lightning

1238
01:47:47,626 --> 01:47:48,753
Aah!

1239
01:47:49,170 --> 01:47:50,673
Aah!

1240
01:48:13,075 --> 01:48:14,410
Aah!

1241
01:48:48,995 --> 01:48:51,206
I'm really going to
enjoy this now. Haah!

1242
01:49:16,155 --> 01:49:17,698
Yaah!

1243
01:49:23,956 --> 01:49:25,790
Aah!

1244
01:49:39,682 --> 01:49:41,312
FROST: Hey, Blade.

1245
01:49:43,272 --> 01:49:45,232
Let's do this.

1246
01:50:28,411 --> 01:50:29,787
Aah!

1247
01:50:30,330 --> 01:50:32,249
Aah! Aah!

1248
01:50:38,925 --> 01:50:40,634
You're too late, Blade.

1249
01:51:00,200 --> 01:51:01,368
My turn.

1250
01:51:27,902 --> 01:51:28,695
Look at you.

1251
01:51:29,154 --> 01:51:30,363
You're a little bitch.

1252
01:51:32,282 --> 01:51:33,826
What, your serum?

1253
01:51:34,242 --> 01:51:35,745
It can't help you
now, stud.

1254
01:51:43,212 --> 01:51:44,255
Nice shot.

1255
01:52:05,323 --> 01:52:07,659
BLADE: Aah!

1256
01:52:09,954 --> 01:52:11,707
Aah!

1257
01:52:12,123 --> 01:52:13,709
Aah! Aah!

1258
01:52:16,545 --> 01:52:17,254
Some motherfuckers

1259
01:52:17,755 --> 01:52:20,592
are always trying
to ice-skate uphill.

1260
01:52:26,767 --> 01:52:27,726
Uhh!

1261
01:52:37,363 --> 01:52:42,327
Aah!

1262
01:52:52,591 --> 01:52:54,218
KAREN: Blade!

1263
01:53:02,269 --> 01:53:03,147
Let's get out of here.

1264
01:53:40,274 --> 01:53:41,820
I need to get back
to the lab

1265
01:53:42,278 --> 01:53:44,822
if I'm going to cure you.

1266
01:53:45,322 --> 01:53:46,866
It's not over.

1267
01:53:47,368 --> 01:53:48,786
You keep your cure.

1268
01:53:49,912 --> 01:53:51,372
There's still
a war going on,

1269
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,876
and I have a job to do.

1270
01:53:54,335 --> 01:53:56,086
You want to help,

1271
01:53:56,545 --> 01:53:58,923
make me a better serum.

1272
01:53:59,305 --> 01:54:59,697
