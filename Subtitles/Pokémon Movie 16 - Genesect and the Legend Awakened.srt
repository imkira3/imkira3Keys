1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:12,574
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:36,064
pursuing his goal of
becoming a Pokémon Master!

3
00:09:45,818 --> 00:09:46,785
Pikachu?

4
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:48,953
Ew?

5
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:50,655
Axew!

6
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:52,090
Pika, Pika!

7
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,558
- Pika!
- Axew!

8
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:58,857
- Pika, Pika!
- Axew, Ew, Axew!

9
00:10:00,466 --> 00:10:01,433
Ash: Ah...

10
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,736
I feel awesome!

11
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,404
Me too!

12
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,007
I'm so happy,
I could fly!

13
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:11,567
The gentle warmth of
the sun filtering through

14
00:18:12,857 --> 00:18:14,825
So are you lost
or something?

15
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,128
Lost?

16
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:18,994
Don't know
where you are.

17
00:18:19,097 --> 00:18:21,327
I mean, lost!

18
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:25,462
How can
I explain this?

19
00:18:25,737 --> 00:18:28,035
When you're lost, it's
like, "Mommy, Mommy!

20
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:30,666
Where are you?"

21
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,168
You get it?

22
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:39,616
- Pika...
- Ash!

23
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,250
- Is that a Pokémon?
- Ew?

24
00:18:46,858 --> 00:18:48,155
I've never seen it!

25
00:18:48,426 --> 00:18:50,053
Yeah, I think
it's lost.

26
00:18:50,261 --> 00:18:51,728
But how do you know?

27
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,889
- It told me so.
- Yeah?

28
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,767
- It changed!
- Ew!

29
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,666
Hey, it's all right.

30
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:01,533
- They're friends of mine.
- Pikachu!

31
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:12,702
Do it!

32
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,836
Yes...

33
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,249
Ew!

34
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,180
Wait, stop!

35
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:32,213
Do it!

36
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:37,324
- I said stop!
- Pika!

37
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:42,024
- Do it!
- Yes, I must...

38
00:21:43,668 --> 00:21:45,966
Stop it, now!

39
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:02,915
Let's go!

40
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:31,675
- It just changed!
- Hold on.

41
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,817
You're...

42
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:34,084
I am Mewtwo.

43
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:35,986
Cilan: Mewtwo?

44
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,118
Are you all right?

45
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,390
- Yeah.
- Axew!

46
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:40,758
We're fine!

47
00:22:41,025 --> 00:22:42,993
I am not speaking
to you.

48
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:45,763
I am asking
Pikachu and Axew.

49
00:22:46,197 --> 00:22:47,164
- Ew?
- Pika, Pikachu!

50
00:22:50,201 --> 00:22:51,168
That was dangerous.

51
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,837
Pika, Pika!

52
00:22:54,172 --> 00:22:56,163
Thanks for getting us
out of that trouble!

53
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:57,901
I don't need
your gratitude.

54
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,709
I was only trying to
save the Pokémon.

55
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,779
Wait a minute!

56
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:06,272
Who was that Pokémon
we were with before?

57
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,681
Please tell me,
I've gotta know!

58
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:20,891
Hold on!

59
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:25,296
It didn't act like
that at all...

60
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,261
- But it attacked us.
- Right.

61
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:32,799
- Yeah, but...
- Pika, Pika!

62
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:37,207
I want you to forget
that you saw me.

63
00:24:47,852 --> 00:24:48,819
Mewtwo...

64
00:24:50,121 --> 00:24:51,748
You saw that,
didn't you?

65
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,153
With both my eyes!

66
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:01,676
(sirens wailing)

67
00:27:11,929 --> 00:27:12,896
Bello, Bell, Bello!

68
00:27:13,831 --> 00:27:14,798
- Ledy!
- Deerling, Deerling!

69
00:27:17,101 --> 00:27:18,728
- Saws!
- Herd, Herd, Herd, Herd!

70
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:20,971
Durant,
Durant, Durant!

71
00:27:43,127 --> 00:27:44,094
- Dwebble!
- Geodude, Geodude!

72
00:27:46,697 --> 00:27:49,757
- Dwebble, Dweb!
- Geodude!

73
00:27:50,768 --> 00:27:51,735
Surskit, Surskit!

74
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,427
Surskit, Surskit,
Surskit!

75
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,003
Gatr!

76
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:05,111
- Beau, Beautifly!
- Beautifly, Beautifly!

77
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:07,274
- Shroomish!
- Roserade!

78
00:28:12,423 --> 00:28:14,414
Masquerain, Masquerain!

79
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,493
Starly, Starly,
Starly, Starly!

80
00:28:20,531 --> 00:28:23,193
Starly, Starly,
Starly, Starly, Starly!

81
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:59,898
Sab, Sable...
Sableye!

82
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,907
Sab, Sab, Sab, Sab, Sableye,
Sableye, Sableye!

83
00:29:35,973 --> 00:29:36,940
- That's weird...
- Ee?

84
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:40,644
- Eevee...
- Watchog!

85
00:29:40,745 --> 00:29:42,110
- What's for dinner?
- Watch, Watchog!

86
00:29:42,213 --> 00:29:43,180
- I wanna have sandwiches!
- Watchog!

87
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,976
Woman: Okay, that
sounds great!

88
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:48,074
Soon as we're done, I could
go for some sandwiches myself!

89
00:29:48,185 --> 00:29:49,152
- Durr!
- Great!

90
00:29:49,353 --> 00:29:50,377
Man: You pick up the tab.

91
00:29:50,488 --> 00:29:51,455
Gurrdurr!

92
00:29:51,622 --> 00:29:54,455
Man: Not again!

93
00:29:55,192 --> 00:29:56,159
Hey!

94
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,557
Thanks a lot, Ampharos!

95
00:29:57,795 --> 00:29:59,763
So let's... get
this wrapped up!

96
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,691
Watchog!

97
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,030
All: Yay, time to eat!

98
00:30:09,373 --> 00:30:10,567
- Pikachu!
- Wow, this is so good!

99
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,642
- Yeah!
- Pika!

100
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:13,401
- Axew, Ew, Ew!
- It's the local specialty.

101
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:15,502
- Axew...
- It's delicious!

102
00:30:22,186 --> 00:30:23,153
What's going on?

103
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:25,155
Woo, Woobat, Woobat!

104
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,057
- Woobat.
- Swoobat, Swoobat!

105
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,226
Swoobat!

106
00:30:32,463 --> 00:30:33,760
What's all
the hubbub?

107
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,966
They're saying they were attacked by
some wacko Pokémon.

108
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,592
I'll bet you it's
the Genesect!

109
00:30:38,703 --> 00:30:40,000
You'd win that bet!

110
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:43,299
Ready or not, little
Genesect, here we come!

111
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:48,412
- Pika, Pika!
- Axew!

112
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:49,846
- Ew, Axew!
- Pika!

113
00:30:50,514 --> 00:30:52,345
- Ew, Axew, Ew!
- Pika, Pika, Pika!

114
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:53,417
- Axew, Ew!
- Pika!

115
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:55,712
- Axew, Axew, Axew, Axew!
- Pika?

116
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:57,884
Sab, Sableye,
Sableye, Sableye!

117
00:30:58,456 --> 00:30:59,423
Sableye, Sableye,
Sableye!

118
00:31:01,158 --> 00:31:02,125
- Sableye, what?
- Pikachu!

119
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:04,995
- Sableye!
- Pikachu!

120
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,166
Eye, Eye, Sableye!

121
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:11,134
It's Pokémon Hills.

122
00:31:11,402 --> 00:31:13,597
Something must
be wrong!

123
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,344
Sab, Sab, Sab!

124
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:21,611
Sableye, Sable,
Sableye.

125
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,747
Deerling, Deerling,
Deerling!

126
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,672
Something's up,
that's for sure!

127
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,809
- Sableye!
- Deer?

128
00:31:31,288 --> 00:31:33,153
Feraligatr!

129
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:35,258
Fer!

130
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:37,820
Eric: Feraligatr!

131
00:31:41,465 --> 00:31:42,432
It's Genesect...

132
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:44,425
So that's what
they look like...

133
00:31:44,535 --> 00:31:46,332
Why are they chasing
away the Pokémon?

134
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,598
Axew!

135
00:31:49,974 --> 00:31:50,941
Roserade.

136
00:31:51,142 --> 00:31:52,109
Roserade.

137
00:31:52,777 --> 00:31:54,335
This Ralts has been
badly hurt!

138
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:56,413
I'll run to
the Pokémon Center!

139
00:31:56,714 --> 00:31:58,682
Thank you!

140
00:32:04,121 --> 00:32:06,180
Eye!

141
00:32:10,161 --> 00:32:11,753
- What are you doing?
- Pika!

142
00:32:11,862 --> 00:32:13,159
We should turn back!

143
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:14,631
But why?

144
00:32:14,932 --> 00:32:16,627
There's no need
to upset them here.

145
00:32:16,734 --> 00:32:20,135
Ash!

146
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:25,842
This way!

147
00:32:26,076 --> 00:32:28,237
Sable, Sableye,
Sable, Sable!

148
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,554
Eric: The workers use
this corridor.

149
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,949
It connects to
Pokémon Hills.

150
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,805
What's up with that?

151
00:32:59,176 --> 00:33:00,143
Who cares?

152
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,710
Let's catch
them all pronto!

153
00:33:01,812 --> 00:33:03,780
Off we go!

154
00:33:20,397 --> 00:33:21,364
What's this?

155
00:33:22,132 --> 00:33:23,099
Power.

156
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,631
It's the transformer
substation.

157
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,901
It sends electricity
to the whole city.

158
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,406
Look...

159
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:32,035
Sable!

160
00:33:35,579 --> 00:33:38,139
(sirens wailing)

161
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,019
Mewtwo: I always thought
I was alone...

162
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:56,325
I rejected everything.

163
00:35:17,948 --> 00:35:18,915
- Ccino!
- Nido!

164
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:20,951
- Oddish!
- Furret, Furret?

165
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:24,080
- Tang, Tang?
- Tangrowth?

166
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:29,492
Ccino,
Ccino, Ccino...

167
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:31,628
- Whim!
- Lil!

168
00:35:33,697 --> 00:35:34,755
Whim!

169
00:35:46,243 --> 00:35:47,210
Mewtwo: But...

170
00:35:48,212 --> 00:35:50,908
I wasn't alone
after all.

171
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:57,053
- Swanna!
- Swanna!

172
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,752
Swanna!

173
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:01,992
- Vul, Vulpix?
- Tangrowth.

174
00:36:02,359 --> 00:36:03,326
- Ccino, Ccino.
- Teddiursa!

175
00:36:04,628 --> 00:36:06,493
Oddish!

176
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,526
Finally, I had discovered
a place where I belong.

177
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,902
The Genesect
deserve as much!

178
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:21,402
Starly, Star,
Star, Star!

179
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,479
Starly,
Starly, Starly!

180
00:36:22,813 --> 00:36:23,780
Starly, Starly,
Starly!

181
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:25,482
What?

182
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,914
I understand.

183
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,421
Starly, Starly,
Starly, Starly, Starly!

184
00:37:00,884 --> 00:37:02,374
Where did that
thing come from?

185
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,510
- Whoa, it's huge!
- Pika!

186
00:37:08,325 --> 00:37:09,519
Sable!

187
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:10,593
Sableye!

188
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:14,059
Sableye, Sableye!

189
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:17,834
Pikachu?

190
00:37:18,035 --> 00:37:19,002
Pikachu!

191
00:37:19,937 --> 00:37:21,234
- Hey, it's you!
- Pika!

192
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:24,774
Please... forgive me.

193
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,877
It's apologizing...

194
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:29,542
- Yeah, but why?
- Axew!

195
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:30,914
I know.

196
00:37:31,648 --> 00:37:34,947
It can't disobey
the red Genesect!

197
00:37:37,387 --> 00:37:39,753
Over here, this way!

198
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,665
I guess you must really
like this flower, huh?

199
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,297
I like this flower.

200
00:37:52,536 --> 00:37:53,503
- There.
- Pika?

201
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,065
It bloomed in our home...

202
00:37:57,007 --> 00:37:59,737
In your home?

203
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,746
I get it!

204
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,675
This has to be
the Genesect's nest!

205
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:05,749
Ew, Ew!

206
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:07,984
Of course!

207
00:38:08,218 --> 00:38:09,776
They thought it would
be perfect in here!

208
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:11,821
Pika!

209
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,034
Eye?

210
00:38:25,369 --> 00:38:27,064
Sableye!

211
00:38:38,749 --> 00:38:41,479
- This is bad!
- What's wrong?

212
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,250
It's out of control.

213
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:46,413
If we don't
fix this...

214
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,868
We've got to stop
the Genesect!

215
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:01,538
And not just for
Pokémon Hills.

216
00:39:01,638 --> 00:39:03,265
The entire city
is in danger!

217
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:04,670
We've gotta
do something!

218
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:07,535
- Yeah, but what?
- Pika, Pika!

219
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,042
Gatr...

220
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,826
Feraligatr!

221
00:39:24,094 --> 00:39:25,061
No way!

222
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,387
Gatr!

223
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:29,966
Gatr!

224
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:32,869
Ral?

225
00:39:34,204 --> 00:39:36,365
Feraligatr!

226
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:41,911
- Mewtwo!
- Pika?

227
00:39:42,479 --> 00:39:44,447
- Incredible!
- Sab!

228
00:39:45,582 --> 00:39:48,210
Tr, Gatr!

229
00:39:51,455 --> 00:39:52,422
Oh, no!

230
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:54,922
I'm off to
the substation!

231
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,493
All of you, get
out of here!

232
00:40:01,265 --> 00:40:04,234
You mustn't hurt the other
Pokémon in the city!

233
00:40:05,636 --> 00:40:07,934
I want you to
come with me!

234
00:40:08,105 --> 00:40:10,539
Don't give me orders!

235
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:14,173
Pika!

236
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:16,880
Pikachu, Iron Tail!

237
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,774
Chu, Pika!

238
00:40:21,985 --> 00:40:22,952
Pika.

239
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:25,121
Pika?

240
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:26,522
Pi... Pi, Pi!

241
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:29,885
Pika, Pika,
Pika, Pika!

242
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:34,731
Pikachu!

243
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:37,694
Axew!

244
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,479
You must
listen to me!

245
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:57,754
All right.

246
00:40:58,121 --> 00:41:00,180
If you refuse to
listen to reason,

247
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:03,088
I'll have no other choice
but to battle you.

248
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:14,731
Eevee?

249
00:41:20,944 --> 00:41:23,003
Vee...

250
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,617
Stop it!

251
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,115
People live
in there!

252
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:33,156
Interfere and you
will be destroyed!

253
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,399
I guess I'm simply
wasting my breath.

254
00:42:07,524 --> 00:42:08,855
What?

255
00:42:47,531 --> 00:42:48,828
Quick, Pikachu,
Electro Ball!

256
00:42:49,232 --> 00:42:52,497
Pika, Pika, Pika,
Pikachu, Pi!

257
00:42:55,172 --> 00:42:57,003
Pikachu!

258
00:43:01,144 --> 00:43:02,111
Pikachu!

259
00:43:07,517 --> 00:43:10,042
- Eye!
- Pika?

260
00:43:11,521 --> 00:43:13,546
Pika!

261
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:19,554
(alarm beeping)

262
00:43:26,703 --> 00:43:27,670
- Sable...
- Pika!

263
00:43:33,076 --> 00:43:35,010
Sab, Sab,
Sab, Sableye!

264
00:43:40,383 --> 00:43:42,851
Crustle!

265
00:43:47,858 --> 00:43:49,519
We came as fast
as we could!

266
00:43:49,626 --> 00:43:50,593
Golem!

267
00:43:50,994 --> 00:43:53,622
- Cilan!
- Pika!

268
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:57,533
- Saws, Saws!
- Breloom!

269
00:43:58,435 --> 00:43:59,402
- Loom, Loom!
- Golem!

270
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:01,404
Feraligatr!

271
00:44:03,607 --> 00:44:05,871
Gatr!

272
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,906
Genesect: Enemy!

273
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,819
Destroy them!

274
00:44:19,523 --> 00:44:21,650
We must destroy...

275
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:32,867
Ash: Stop it!

276
00:44:34,271 --> 00:44:35,238
You don't understand!

277
00:44:35,605 --> 00:44:37,664
All the Genesect want is
to have their own home!

278
00:44:37,774 --> 00:44:38,741
Pika, Pikachu!

279
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:40,976
So what does
that mean?

280
00:44:41,077 --> 00:44:43,068
Look!

281
00:44:49,953 --> 00:44:50,920
- Enemy.
- Destroy them.

282
00:44:52,055 --> 00:44:53,022
Destroy them!

283
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:56,256
Pika?

284
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,927
Pika!

285
00:45:21,117 --> 00:45:22,084
Are you okay?

286
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:24,550
Pikachu!

287
00:45:26,590 --> 00:45:28,558
Feral!

288
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,827
Gatr!

289
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,126
Breloom, Breloom!

290
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:39,702
Golem!

291
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:41,604
Ew!

292
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:45,771
Persian!

293
00:45:49,179 --> 00:45:51,306
Persian!

294
00:45:53,049 --> 00:45:54,016
- Geodude!
- Geodude, Dude!

295
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,052
Golem!

296
00:45:56,519 --> 00:45:58,544
Lem!

297
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:04,823
- Feral!
- Brel, Brel, Breloom!

298
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,458
Feraligatr!

299
00:46:09,866 --> 00:46:11,800
Sableye!

300
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,036
Ferali...

301
00:46:14,537 --> 00:46:16,835
Persian...

302
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,242
Sawsbuck!

303
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:29,885
Sawsbuck!

304
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,719
Get in formation.

305
00:46:34,624 --> 00:46:35,591
Destroy them!

306
00:46:36,026 --> 00:46:38,017
Pika!

307
00:46:39,162 --> 00:46:40,129
Saws!

308
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:41,197
Gatr!

309
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:42,698
Pika!

310
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:45,401
Sawsbuck,
Sawsbuck...

311
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:49,870
- Saw!
- Persian!

312
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,111
No...

313
00:46:55,211 --> 00:46:56,178
Don't do it!

314
00:46:57,347 --> 00:47:00,111
Please stop
it now!

315
00:47:07,724 --> 00:47:08,691
Sab, Sableye!

316
00:47:09,025 --> 00:47:09,992
- Bellossom!
- Deerling!

317
00:47:10,293 --> 00:47:11,260
- Saws!
- Sableye!

318
00:47:12,295 --> 00:47:13,262
Pika, Pi!

319
00:47:13,763 --> 00:47:16,027
Pika!

320
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:20,236
- Pika!
- Genesect!

321
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,997
You were trying
to protect me!

322
00:47:26,209 --> 00:47:29,337
I'm glad you're
all right...

323
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,082
Oh, no.

324
00:47:33,316 --> 00:47:36,080
- Genesect, wake up!
- Pika!

325
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:40,423
Pikachu?

326
00:47:41,491 --> 00:47:44,051
- Golem!
- Breloom!

327
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:53,268
Grav, Grav, Graveler!

328
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:56,964
- Saws, Saws?
- Deerling, Deerling!

329
00:47:59,909 --> 00:48:01,672
Pika!

330
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,468
- Grav, Gravel!
- Sawsbuck!

331
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:28,199
Golem!

332
00:48:34,878 --> 00:48:37,403
- It's Mewtwo!
- Pikachu!

333
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:49,358
The Genesect.

334
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:54,158
Maybe they don't
belong in this world.

335
00:48:58,668 --> 00:49:02,365
The very same as it
once was for me.

336
00:49:06,976 --> 00:49:08,603
I can't allow
this anymore.

337
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:13,382
If you do not stop now,
I will defeat you.

338
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:18,652
You cannot defeat us!

339
00:50:15,545 --> 00:50:17,843
- It's so fast!
- Ew!

340
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,086
Pika?

341
00:50:24,587 --> 00:50:25,918
- Sableye?
- Are you all right?

342
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:26,989
Pika?

343
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:29,058
The flowers...

344
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:39,090
- Sawsbuck.
- Feraligatr!

345
00:50:41,871 --> 00:50:43,463
Sableye!

346
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,147
Home.

347
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:55,477
I want to go home.

348
00:50:56,686 --> 00:50:57,653
- Ew.
- Pika...

349
00:50:58,121 --> 00:50:59,088
Eye...

350
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,257
- Herd.
- Gatr.

351
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:03,058
- Bello...
- Deerling, Deerling.

352
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,319
Kirlia...

353
00:51:31,788 --> 00:51:33,619
Now!

354
00:51:58,815 --> 00:52:01,045
Now what?

355
00:52:02,185 --> 00:52:03,152
- Pika?
- Ew!

356
00:52:04,587 --> 00:52:06,214
I don't see an exit!

357
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:09,049
Oy.

358
00:52:14,831 --> 00:52:15,798
Durant, Durant!

359
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:18,400
All: We're sorry!

360
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,996
Durant!

361
00:52:22,438 --> 00:52:26,374
All: We're blasting
off again!

362
00:52:28,878 --> 00:52:30,175
Nurse Joy: No light?

363
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:34,183
I'm going to go check
on the other Pokémon.

364
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:50,566
- Crust?
- Golem!

365
00:52:51,701 --> 00:52:53,430
Crustle?

366
00:53:02,945 --> 00:53:03,912
- Ew!
- Pika!

367
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,945
Oshawott, I choose you!

368
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:09,318
Osha!

369
00:53:09,552 --> 00:53:11,520
Quick, use Hydro Pump
and put out that fire!

370
00:53:11,621 --> 00:53:12,588
Oshawott!

371
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:15,149
Wott!

372
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:21,391
Osha, Osha,
Oshawott!

373
00:53:22,832 --> 00:53:23,799
Gatr!

374
00:53:24,267 --> 00:53:26,827
Feral!

375
00:53:29,038 --> 00:53:30,005
Oshawott!

376
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:32,408
Golem, Golem!

377
00:53:32,575 --> 00:53:33,542
Deerling, Deerling,
Deerling!

378
00:53:33,676 --> 00:53:36,076
Pika?

379
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:40,906
- Geo, Geodude.
- Golem!

380
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,019
Deerling,
Deerling, Deerling!

381
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:52,251
Sableye!

382
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,163
Everyone...

383
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:06,570
Feral!

384
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,382
Deerling, Deer!

385
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:15,643
Deer!

386
00:54:32,101 --> 00:54:34,592
Persian!

387
00:54:39,342 --> 00:54:41,708
Feral!

388
00:54:42,111 --> 00:54:43,078
- Gatr, Tr!
- Persian!

389
00:54:44,213 --> 00:54:46,977
- Ew, Axew!
- Pikachu!

390
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,392
- Ew!
- Pika!

391
00:55:00,062 --> 00:55:02,155
- Ew!
- Genesect!

392
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:05,964
Pika!

393
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,169
Pi?

394
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:14,672
- It was you three...
- Pika, Pika!

395
00:55:19,448 --> 00:55:22,383
- Hang in there, please!
- Pikachu!

396
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,726
Mewtwo!

397
00:56:06,495 --> 00:56:09,259
- Wait, stop!
- Pikachu!

398
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:16,164
The thing is, this place
isn't your home.

399
00:56:16,806 --> 00:56:19,274
But there's gotta be
a home for you somewhere,

400
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:21,775
I'm sure of it!

401
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:23,939
- Ash, run!
- Hurry up!

402
00:56:24,046 --> 00:56:25,343
Move away from there!

403
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,673
I will not!

404
00:56:33,122 --> 00:56:34,089
Tell you what.

405
00:56:34,323 --> 00:56:36,348
We'll help you get back
home, I promise.

406
00:56:36,459 --> 00:56:37,426
Pika, Pikachu!

407
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,829
You see...
I gave my word.

408
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:46,165
I promised I'd take
it back home!

409
00:56:48,437 --> 00:56:49,404
Mewtwo.

410
00:56:49,939 --> 00:56:51,236
All Pokémon
belong somewhere.

411
00:56:52,208 --> 00:56:55,371
There's a place
for every Pokémon!

412
00:56:56,946 --> 00:56:59,574
- Both of you stop fighting now!
- Pika, Pika!

413
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:03,114
Don't give me orders!

414
00:57:05,855 --> 00:57:09,256
- Stop...
- Pikachu!

415
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:13,829
Stop!

416
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:15,897
Enough!

417
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:17,833
How can you?

418
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:19,468
Pika, Pika...
Pikachu!

419
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:21,570
- Breloom!
- Sawsbuck, Sawsbuck!

420
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:23,538
- Golem!
- Graveler!

421
00:57:24,073 --> 00:57:26,564
- Breloom, Breloom!
- Bello, Bello, Bellossom!

422
00:57:29,545 --> 00:57:31,672
All of you.

423
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:34,182
All of you...

424
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,647
Enemies!

425
00:57:51,334 --> 00:57:54,792
You stubbornly refuse
to understand!

426
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,776
Mewtwo!

427
00:58:09,852 --> 00:58:12,650
I have only
one choice!

428
00:58:15,691 --> 00:58:19,388
To go, where no
one else exists!

429
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,357
Beyond the limit!

430
00:59:20,589 --> 00:59:21,556
Genesect: This place...

431
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:23,492
Yes.

432
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:26,453
This is the planet
we both come from.

433
00:59:26,562 --> 00:59:29,531
The planet on which you
and I were created.

434
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:34,164
Created because there is
a reason for us to be here...

435
00:59:35,337 --> 00:59:36,861
The inhabitants
of this planet,

436
00:59:36,972 --> 00:59:38,269
people and
Pokémon alike,

437
00:59:39,842 --> 00:59:41,139
live together
as friends.

438
00:59:42,111 --> 00:59:43,738
Here, we are
all friends.

439
00:59:45,714 --> 00:59:47,341
You and
I are friends.

440
00:59:48,451 --> 00:59:52,285
All... friends...

441
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:05,500
Let's return...

442
01:00:09,772 --> 01:00:12,206
to our home!

443
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:24,581
Genesect: Mewtwo!

444
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:31,819
Return... home...

445
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:47,876
- They're falling...
- Pika?

446
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,108
Iris: Mewtwo and Genesect?

447
01:00:59,255 --> 01:01:01,223
'K ay, Charizard,
go with them too!

448
01:01:03,058 --> 01:01:05,219
Char!

449
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,169
Dragonite!

450
01:01:14,436 --> 01:01:15,698
You go with
Charizard!

451
01:01:15,804 --> 01:01:17,601
Dragonite!

452
01:01:41,363 --> 01:01:43,729
- Dragonite!
- Char!

453
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:54,739
- Osha, Osha!
- Sableye, Sableye!

454
01:01:55,311 --> 01:01:57,404
Axew!

455
01:02:02,384 --> 01:02:05,820
- Dragonite!
- Charizard!

456
01:02:07,089 --> 01:02:09,455
- It's no good!
- Then we'll catch them!

457
01:02:09,558 --> 01:02:11,025
But how do
we do that?

458
01:02:11,126 --> 01:02:12,753
Some kind of
giant cushion?

459
01:02:14,129 --> 01:02:15,994
Cushion?

460
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,039
Feraligatr!

461
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:25,941
That's it!

462
01:02:26,041 --> 01:02:27,008
Pika, Pika!

463
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:30,236
- Ralts!
- Sableye!

464
01:02:48,697 --> 01:02:49,664
- Sawsbuck, Sawsbuck!
- Breloom!

465
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,064
Deerling!

466
01:02:56,805 --> 01:02:57,965
Pika!

467
01:03:02,244 --> 01:03:04,678
- Osha!
- Gatr!

468
01:03:14,323 --> 01:03:15,290
Osha, Osha!

469
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,753
- I'm all right.
- Osha?

470
01:03:44,119 --> 01:03:45,416
Everyone on my planet...

471
01:03:46,588 --> 01:03:47,555
is my friend.

472
01:03:48,624 --> 01:03:49,591
We're all friends.

473
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:51,526
Yeah, that's right!

474
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:53,521
Every one of us
is a friend!

475
01:03:53,629 --> 01:03:54,596
Pikachu!

476
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:56,524
Yes, we are
all friends!

477
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:57,766
Osha, Osha,
Oshawott!

478
01:03:58,400 --> 01:03:59,697
Starly, Star, Star, Starly!

479
01:03:59,935 --> 01:04:00,902
Starly, Starly, Starly!

480
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,864
Starly, Starly!

481
01:04:05,774 --> 01:04:09,369
- Axew, Ew!
- Pika!

482
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,411
Pika?

483
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:20,614
It bloomed in
our home...

484
01:04:22,691 --> 01:04:25,888
I know the place where
they can make a home!

485
01:04:28,497 --> 01:04:29,395
James: Brilliant!

486
01:04:29,498 --> 01:04:30,795
The sun also rises.

487
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:32,967
As surely as night
follows day.

488
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,997
Call me crazy, but for
some strange reason...

489
01:04:36,438 --> 01:04:38,736
all: Mornings can be
an absolute blast!

490
01:04:39,641 --> 01:04:41,541
Starly, Starly, Starly!

491
01:04:46,014 --> 01:04:48,073
We're safe.

492
01:04:58,026 --> 01:05:00,017
It looks like
the power's back on!

493
01:05:00,129 --> 01:05:02,290
Audino!

494
01:05:10,139 --> 01:05:11,538
Eric: You figured
it out, Ash.

495
01:05:11,640 --> 01:05:12,607
Good work!

496
01:05:13,942 --> 01:05:15,204
They say the Panna Lotus
has been around

497
01:05:15,310 --> 01:05:16,607
for 300 million years.

498
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,915
That's when the
Genesect were around!

499
01:05:23,285 --> 01:05:24,582
I like this place!

500
01:05:24,787 --> 01:05:25,754
- That's great!
- Ew!

501
01:05:26,688 --> 01:05:28,315
I like you all, too!

502
01:05:29,291 --> 01:05:30,417
And we like you!

503
01:05:30,526 --> 01:05:32,824
- Pika, Pika!
- Ew!

504
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:39,958
You've got enough
room in this park

505
01:05:40,068 --> 01:05:41,899
to build the biggest
home in the world!

506
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:42,971
Pika, Pika!

507
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,073
Mewtwo: Ash...

508
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:49,277
You found a place for
the Genesect to live.

509
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,345
Thank you.

510
01:05:50,479 --> 01:05:53,277
Well, I had
a lot of help!

511
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:57,515
I'm glad to have
met you all.

512
01:05:58,153 --> 01:05:59,450
- I'm glad too!
- Pikachu!

513
01:06:00,622 --> 01:06:01,919
- So am I!
- Axew!

514
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:04,986
A pleasure...

515
01:06:07,196 --> 01:06:08,493
We'll always
be friends!

516
01:06:09,898 --> 01:06:10,865
Yes, you're right.

517
01:06:12,234 --> 01:06:14,202
I trust in
those words, Ash.

518
01:06:14,470 --> 01:06:17,803
I do now, and will
forevermore!

519
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:26,414
- Ew, Ew!
- Pika!

520
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:28,650
Ax!

521
01:06:29,017 --> 01:06:30,644
Take care of
yourself, Mewtwo.

522
01:06:30,919 --> 01:06:32,216
- Pika, Pika!
- Maybe someday...

523
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,782
- We'll meet again.
- Ew, Ew!

524
01:06:36,525 --> 01:06:39,187
- Count on it!
- Pikachu!

525
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:23,734
Oh we had some fun
out there now didn't we

526
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:31,472
I never knew the world had
so much for us to see

527
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:43,097
We'll have to go
and say hello another day

528
01:10:44,706 --> 01:10:46,674
We're on our way

529
01:10:46,942 --> 01:10:48,910
Oh we're
coming home

530
01:10:51,012 --> 01:10:53,981
The only place that's
never too far

531
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:55,383
Oh

532
01:10:56,251 --> 01:10:57,878
We're coming home

533
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:01,355
It's time to listen
to their call

534
01:11:01,456 --> 01:11:03,549
When adventure
comes our way

535
01:11:03,658 --> 01:11:05,956
We'll go back
and play

536
01:11:06,194 --> 01:11:08,492
We'll go back and play

537
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:13,123
Oh we're
coming home

538
01:11:13,235 --> 01:11:16,204
The only place that's
never too far

539
01:11:16,638 --> 01:11:17,605
Oh

540
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,167
We're coming home
