2
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,963
Mortal Kombat
is not about death...

3
00:00:58,004 --> 00:01:01,462
but, rather,
the preservation of life.

4
00:01:01,506 --> 00:01:04,964
Liu Kang and few fighters
from the Earth Realm...

5
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:07,945
defeated Outworld sorcerer
Shang Tsung.

6
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:10,811
According to the rules
of Mortal Kombat...

7
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:15,617
their victory preserved earth's
safety for another generation.

8
00:01:16,356 --> 00:01:19,416
Our chosen ones
were returned to earth...

9
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:21,928
only to enjoy
a brief period of peace.

10
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:29,463
For someone from Outworld
has a different point of view.

11
00:02:49,054 --> 00:02:51,887
Shao-Kahn, emperor of Outworld.

12
00:02:52,792 --> 00:02:56,421
The earth
was created in six days...

13
00:02:56,462 --> 00:03:00,159
so shall it be destroyed.

14
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:07,066
On the seventh day,
mankind will rest in peace!

15
00:03:10,944 --> 00:03:12,468
This is not good.

16
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,242
Somehow he's opened gateways
to your world.

17
00:03:15,282 --> 00:03:17,876
Our Mortal Kombat victory
closed those portals.

18
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:19,816
What closes can open again.

19
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,377
What does that mean?

20
00:03:28,229 --> 00:03:29,423
Mother.

21
00:03:31,433 --> 00:03:32,661
You're alive.

22
00:03:32,701 --> 00:03:36,262
Too bad you... will die.

23
00:03:51,653 --> 00:03:55,145
As long as I have the power,
you will never rule this world.

24
00:03:55,224 --> 00:04:00,321
As long as the portal is open,
your world becomes mine!

25
00:04:19,951 --> 00:04:22,078
You will never win.

26
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,953
Master.

27
00:05:08,903 --> 00:05:10,427
This ends now!

28
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,336
You hide behind a human?

29
00:05:12,872 --> 00:05:15,272
Why not, Lord Rayden?

30
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:18,039
You hid behind them
your entire life.

31
00:05:20,781 --> 00:05:22,510
No, Johnny!

32
00:05:37,132 --> 00:05:40,124
Surrender, Rayden, or he dies.

33
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:43,695
I'll take your generals.

34
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,732
Earth does not bend
to the will of tyrants.

35
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:51,371
You would never let
one of your humans die.

36
00:05:59,556 --> 00:06:01,456
Trade me for Johnny Cage.

37
00:06:01,491 --> 00:06:05,222
Come bow at my feet.

38
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,560
You fool!

39
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:34,424
In six days, you will bow to me!

40
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,287
It has begun!

41
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,713
We can't let Kahn get away.

42
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:05,350
We can't win here.

43
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:07,452
Annihilate 'em!

44
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,533
We must go.

45
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:28,043
Move back!

46
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:35,654
Kahn opened the portal.

47
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,986
Your planet and Outworld
have begun to merge into one.

48
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,728
Think of it as hell on earth.

49
00:07:47,771 --> 00:07:50,137
My mother... resurrected.

50
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:52,935
How is that possible?

51
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:56,037
Your mother Sindel
may be the key.

52
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:58,343
This can't be!
We won the tournament!

53
00:07:58,382 --> 00:08:00,873
The rules say earth is safe
for another generation.

54
00:08:00,918 --> 00:08:03,443
Kahn has broken the rules.

55
00:08:03,486 --> 00:08:07,149
He resurrected Sindel to keep
these portals open indefinitely.

56
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:11,287
By reuniting you with her,
Kahn's spell will be broken...

57
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:14,859
your mother's soul
will be at peace...

58
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,458
and his portals closed.

59
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:18,526
How could the Elder Gods
allow this?

60
00:08:18,603 --> 00:08:19,968
They do not know.

61
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,972
Kahn must be stopped,
or your world will perish.

62
00:08:23,008 --> 00:08:25,442
We have six days
until annihilation.

63
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:28,446
I beat Shang Tsung.
I can beat Kahn.

64
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,540
You beat a great sorcerer...

65
00:08:32,452 --> 00:08:34,420
but you're no match for Kahn.

66
00:08:34,454 --> 00:08:37,514
If anyone's killing Kahn,
it's me.

67
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:38,717
Enough!

68
00:08:44,697 --> 00:08:46,289
You are far from ready.

69
00:08:46,332 --> 00:08:51,269
Kahn's extermination squads
will be everywhere, hunting.

70
00:08:51,338 --> 00:08:53,499
I am telling you this
for your own good.

71
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:56,566
Kahn knows I have no powers
in Outworld.

72
00:08:56,643 --> 00:09:00,807
As the two realms merge,
I will lose my powers on earth.

73
00:09:00,848 --> 00:09:04,215
You must grow stronger,
together.

74
00:09:05,119 --> 00:09:07,053
We are the only hope.

75
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:18,466
We couldn't even save Johnny.

76
00:09:22,471 --> 00:09:24,132
What do these do?

77
00:09:24,173 --> 00:09:28,633
Inside the velosphere, you can
go anywhere on earth in hours.

78
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,679
The inner winds propel you.

79
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:35,082
You'll move so fast, it'll be
like you're not moving.

80
00:09:38,555 --> 00:09:39,920
We need your help, Sonya.

81
00:09:39,956 --> 00:09:42,220
I'll take you
to your partner Jax.

82
00:09:42,259 --> 00:09:45,922
Forget it. If I die, fine,
but I'm not losing anybody else.

83
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:47,327
Alone, you are vulnerable...

84
00:09:47,364 --> 00:09:50,856
but if you work together,
you can do much.

85
00:09:50,901 --> 00:09:52,061
What about us?

86
00:09:52,102 --> 00:09:54,297
You two will travel
to the Hopi mesa.

87
00:09:54,338 --> 00:09:58,138
You did great last time,
but now you need help.

88
00:09:58,174 --> 00:10:00,404
Go deep into the night.

89
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:03,038
Seek the counsel of Nightwolf.

90
00:10:03,114 --> 00:10:05,912
You will not find him.
He will find you.

91
00:10:07,385 --> 00:10:12,687
I will speak with the Elder Gods
and demand answers.

92
00:10:12,724 --> 00:10:14,521
- Ready?
- Ready.

93
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:15,787
Here we go.

94
00:10:19,231 --> 00:10:21,461
They are faster than I remember.

95
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:22,798
I can't wait.

96
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,104
This is amazing.

97
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,045
It's the hot air
from earth's core.

98
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:37,549
We harness its energy.

99
00:10:44,491 --> 00:10:46,049
Where are we?

100
00:10:46,093 --> 00:10:48,084
The interchange.
Roll to your right.

101
00:10:53,301 --> 00:10:54,632
Hold on to me.

102
00:11:51,496 --> 00:11:54,192
Father, the merger has begun.

103
00:11:54,232 --> 00:11:56,223
Earth is under attack.

104
00:11:56,267 --> 00:11:58,861
It is glorious!

105
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:04,035
Did you make Rayden beg
before destroying him?

106
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:15,313
Rayden is of no concern.

107
00:12:19,024 --> 00:12:20,992
You let him live?

108
00:12:22,595 --> 00:12:24,085
He could not be stopped.

109
00:12:25,197 --> 00:12:27,665
I have no use for excuses.

110
00:12:28,635 --> 00:12:32,230
I have broken the sacred rules
to keep the portals open.

111
00:12:32,273 --> 00:12:34,639
If the Elder Gods
learn of our plot...

112
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:37,541
we shall both
suffer the consequences.

113
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:38,840
I do not understand.

114
00:12:38,879 --> 00:12:41,871
How can you fear the Elder Gods?

115
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:45,476
With control of earth,
our power will be absolute.

116
00:12:45,553 --> 00:12:48,681
Until the sixth day
has passed...

117
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:51,783
we can take no chances
with Rayden and his mortals.

118
00:12:54,596 --> 00:12:58,555
Do not underestimate
the power of the human spirit.

119
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:39,097
Liu, if anything happens to me...

120
00:13:39,676 --> 00:13:43,635
Kitana, I have lost everything.

121
00:13:47,818 --> 00:13:50,651
I am not going to lose you, too.

122
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,798
The missile!

123
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:25,945
You must go.

124
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,510
There will be others.

125
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,422
I killed you.

126
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,521
You killed my older brother.

127
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:37,125
Why did you help us?

128
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:38,962
I helped her.

129
00:16:39,033 --> 00:16:43,595
Legend says the princess
is the key to stopping Kahn.

130
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:46,163
You've been following us.
Why?

131
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,108
Kahn reprogrammed Smoke
to come after you...

132
00:16:50,145 --> 00:16:52,443
in order to keep you apart
from Queen Sindel.

133
00:16:54,483 --> 00:16:56,348
How do we get to Nightwolf?

134
00:16:56,385 --> 00:16:58,876
We have a common enemy,
Sub-Zero.

135
00:16:58,921 --> 00:17:02,755
You must help us
if you want to stop Kahn.

136
00:17:07,964 --> 00:17:09,932
Let's hope you succeed.

137
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:46,100
Get over here!

138
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:26,573
Take it!

139
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:32,077
Suckers!

140
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:41,549
I've got to find Kitana.

141
00:19:41,593 --> 00:19:44,027
Kahn wants you to go after her.

142
00:19:44,063 --> 00:19:45,621
Don't.

143
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,859
Without Kitana, it's over.

144
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,529
You alone are not ready
for what's ahead.

145
00:20:17,865 --> 00:20:21,824
You'll take the same track back
and turn where I showed you.

146
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,565
Don't worry about me.

147
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,935
Is it like this everywhere?

148
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,770
Each hour, the merger
of the realms grows closer.

149
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,576
More of the earth
will be destroyed.

150
00:20:43,191 --> 00:20:46,024
I will meet you
at the temple of the Elder Gods.

151
00:20:59,342 --> 00:21:00,969
Jax!

152
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:06,274
Thought I was supposed
to be rescuing you.

153
00:21:06,351 --> 00:21:08,114
I couldn't wait.

154
00:21:09,086 --> 00:21:11,577
What have you done
to yourself now?

155
00:21:11,656 --> 00:21:13,624
Cybernetic strength-enhancers.

156
00:21:13,691 --> 00:21:17,127
It quadruples
your muscle capacity.

157
00:21:17,195 --> 00:21:19,891
You've got a confidence problem.

158
00:21:23,968 --> 00:21:27,802
These locks must be
on some remote-access mechanism.

159
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,535
What you doing here?

160
00:21:29,575 --> 00:21:31,008
Everybody split.

161
00:21:31,043 --> 00:21:33,739
The facility will be trashed
by an extermination squad.

162
00:21:33,779 --> 00:21:36,942
What you mean,
extermination squad?

163
00:21:36,982 --> 00:21:39,678
They're trying to kill me,
probably you, too.

164
00:21:39,752 --> 00:21:41,583
I don't even know them.

165
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:46,953
Damn it!

166
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:48,620
I can't free you.

167
00:21:48,661 --> 00:21:51,221
Stand back.
Let's see what I'm made of.

168
00:21:58,171 --> 00:22:00,002
That's what I'm talking about.

169
00:22:06,614 --> 00:22:08,445
Wish I had these in high school.

170
00:22:08,482 --> 00:22:10,313
You'll wish
you were in high school.

171
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,045
Hurry!

172
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:28,268
What is that?

173
00:23:12,584 --> 00:23:15,382
Death is the only way out.

174
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:20,380
Major Briggs, Sonya Blade...
Shao-Kahn will be pleased.

175
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:21,755
Shao what?

176
00:23:23,229 --> 00:23:24,821
I'll take homeboy.

177
00:23:32,104 --> 00:23:35,403
I take it this ain't something
we can talk about.

178
00:24:17,419 --> 00:24:18,943
Heads up!

179
00:24:36,339 --> 00:24:37,966
Catch this!

180
00:25:06,238 --> 00:25:07,728
Now what?

181
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,841
Cybernetic strength-enhancers!

182
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,472
Nice look...

183
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,739
but I'd lose the wall.

184
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:48,043
I was just getting
a feel for it.

185
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:51,984
Watch out.

186
00:26:40,571 --> 00:26:42,334
You barbecued his ass.

187
00:26:43,907 --> 00:26:45,067
Look at this.

188
00:27:00,459 --> 00:27:02,188
Does this mean what I think?

189
00:27:02,227 --> 00:27:04,218
Too bad I didn't get new legs.

190
00:27:31,457 --> 00:27:35,450
My squads have claimed thousands
of innocent souls on earth.

191
00:27:35,496 --> 00:27:37,794
I will claim millions.

192
00:27:37,831 --> 00:27:41,323
By now, you'd be behind bars
in a zoo.

193
00:27:41,368 --> 00:27:45,099
If those bars kept me away
from you, Sheeva...

194
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,698
I would welcome them!

195
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:58,480
Silence!

196
00:28:03,825 --> 00:28:05,349
What is your report?

197
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:08,089
Two of earth's best warriors
have been taken...

198
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,995
Kabaal and Stryker.

199
00:28:10,032 --> 00:28:15,299
Did you make them beg
before you destroyed them?

200
00:28:15,337 --> 00:28:17,897
I thought if I let them live...

201
00:28:17,941 --> 00:28:19,465
I have no use for excuses!

202
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:33,889
Rain,
this will never happen again.

203
00:28:33,925 --> 00:28:36,359
It will never happen again.

204
00:28:43,434 --> 00:28:46,562
It is true
this will never happen again.

205
00:28:47,605 --> 00:28:49,766
I need a new general.

206
00:28:51,976 --> 00:28:55,434
You can die in duty
or by my hand.

207
00:28:55,481 --> 00:28:57,449
Centaurs are known
for their hunting prowess.

208
00:28:57,483 --> 00:29:01,317
As general, I will personally
hunt down every human soul...

209
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:03,321
and spare no one!

210
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:04,913
Motaro can't be trusted.

211
00:29:04,957 --> 00:29:08,723
Long ago, I proved myself
as the protector of Sindel.

212
00:29:08,761 --> 00:29:11,753
Your orders are mine to follow.

213
00:29:11,798 --> 00:29:14,494
The energies they waste
with their sniveling...

214
00:29:14,534 --> 00:29:17,628
I would use to capture souls.

215
00:29:19,205 --> 00:29:22,368
You are all too impetuous
for such important work.

216
00:29:23,744 --> 00:29:28,738
You are my new general,
Queen Sindel...

217
00:29:30,217 --> 00:29:34,051
unless anyone
has a different point of view.

218
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:19,629
Pretty cool, huh?

219
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,858
It's my animality.

220
00:31:21,902 --> 00:31:23,767
Who are you?

221
00:31:23,804 --> 00:31:25,396
Wouldn't you like to know?

222
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,172
So you're Rayden's prodigy.

223
00:31:29,277 --> 00:31:30,471
I've seen better.

224
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:32,872
Don't sweat it.

225
00:31:32,914 --> 00:31:34,882
I've seen worse, too.

226
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,910
If you are Nightwolf,
you know I won Mortal Kombat.

227
00:31:40,956 --> 00:31:43,015
Don't get cocky.

228
00:31:43,091 --> 00:31:44,683
The tournament had rules.

229
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,284
This time, anything goes.

230
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,090
It was a mistake coming here.

231
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:53,828
You think you're ready...

232
00:31:53,869 --> 00:31:56,394
but if you were,
would Kitana have been captured?

233
00:32:00,944 --> 00:32:02,536
Can you help me get her back?

234
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:05,807
Maybe.

235
00:32:05,848 --> 00:32:07,440
Kitana is important.

236
00:32:07,484 --> 00:32:10,214
To beat Shao-Kahn,
you've got to pass three tests.

237
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,387
First one's courage.

238
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:15,050
I don't have time
for these stupid games!

239
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:18,060
To test your courage
and find your animality...

240
00:32:18,095 --> 00:32:20,359
you've got to enter
a dream state.

241
00:32:20,965 --> 00:32:23,365
How am I supposed to do that?

242
00:32:26,704 --> 00:32:31,334
There's a slow way
and a fast way.

243
00:32:31,376 --> 00:32:33,537
No time for the slow way.

244
00:32:34,579 --> 00:32:36,046
That's what I thought you'd say.

245
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:40,948
Sweet dreams.

246
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:55,533
I had faith in you,
but you failed me.

247
00:32:56,436 --> 00:32:58,301
You are not the warrior
I thought you were.

248
00:32:59,505 --> 00:33:02,406
What if I fail everyone?

249
00:33:02,442 --> 00:33:04,603
Your brother's soul is mine!

250
00:33:10,717 --> 00:33:12,742
Fight from the inside.

251
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:17,053
It's the fire inside of you,
your faith in yourself...

252
00:33:17,458 --> 00:33:19,289
that can never be defeated.

253
00:33:20,962 --> 00:33:24,728
The fire inside you is killed.

254
00:33:24,766 --> 00:33:27,234
You lost Kitana.

255
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:28,735
You are not a leader.

256
00:33:28,804 --> 00:33:30,635
Find that power inside you.

257
00:33:31,606 --> 00:33:33,073
Feel your animality.

258
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:45,452
You will fail!

259
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:37,908
I am Jade.

260
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,811
I have searched the mesa
for you.

261
00:34:51,157 --> 00:34:54,251
Of all the horrors
darkness holds...

262
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,853
to die alone...

263
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:00,260
that is my worst fear.

264
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:11,511
With you, I'm not afraid.

265
00:35:15,382 --> 00:35:18,078
This is almost
too good to be true.

266
00:35:21,089 --> 00:35:23,353
The same
could be said about you.

267
00:35:35,037 --> 00:35:36,231
My heart...

268
00:35:38,407 --> 00:35:40,341
belongs to another.

269
00:35:54,424 --> 00:35:56,016
I can't.

270
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,618
There's not much time left.

271
00:36:12,543 --> 00:36:14,408
Is this just another dream?

272
00:36:24,790 --> 00:36:29,454
How can you beat Shao-Kahn
when I am too much for you?

273
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:58,284
First you betray me,
now you laugh?

274
00:36:58,325 --> 00:37:01,192
You are more pure and faithful
than I heard.

275
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,857
You have passed the test.

276
00:37:05,866 --> 00:37:07,128
A test?

277
00:37:11,105 --> 00:37:13,403
This was just another one
of Nightwolf's tests?

278
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:17,306
We could have killed each other!

279
00:37:17,379 --> 00:37:18,869
But we'll live.

280
00:37:25,987 --> 00:37:28,148
I will lead you to the temple
of the Elder Gods.

281
00:37:28,189 --> 00:37:30,157
I can't.

282
00:37:30,192 --> 00:37:32,490
If this was a test,
it was only his second.

283
00:37:32,528 --> 00:37:34,052
I'm not ready.

284
00:37:34,095 --> 00:37:36,256
Not ready to save Kitana?

285
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:39,497
Because she's the key.

286
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:42,003
I can take you to her.

287
00:37:42,039 --> 00:37:43,506
She's alive?

288
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:46,838
For now, yes.
For how long, I cannot say.

289
00:37:51,748 --> 00:37:53,215
We must go.

290
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:18,200
All your past betrayals
I can forgive.

291
00:38:19,845 --> 00:38:22,370
Please accept this offering.

292
00:38:22,448 --> 00:38:24,416
I do not want your death.

293
00:38:53,647 --> 00:38:56,377
You test my patience.

294
00:39:02,991 --> 00:39:04,856
You destroyed my family.

295
00:39:04,892 --> 00:39:07,520
You drove my mother
to kill herself.

296
00:39:07,562 --> 00:39:10,030
I am your enemy forever.

297
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:14,467
Kill me now... if you dare.

298
00:39:14,503 --> 00:39:17,495
Foolish child.

299
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:23,378
A struggling worm on a hook...

300
00:39:23,412 --> 00:39:26,074
lands a bigger catch
than a dead one.

301
00:39:40,731 --> 00:39:44,167
No trees, no animals.

302
00:39:45,067 --> 00:39:46,534
What's going on here?

303
00:39:48,772 --> 00:39:50,239
Nature's dying.

304
00:39:53,177 --> 00:39:55,577
The merger of the realms
is almost done.

305
00:39:55,612 --> 00:39:58,240
You keep talking
about mergers and realms...

306
00:39:58,283 --> 00:39:59,807
but it don't mean squat to me.

307
00:39:59,884 --> 00:40:01,977
I can't explain it.

308
00:40:02,053 --> 00:40:04,886
We've only got a few days.

309
00:40:04,923 --> 00:40:06,754
Use your imagination.

310
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:08,281
Use my imagination?

311
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:15,026
You keep talking like that,
and I'm gonna split.

312
00:40:16,836 --> 00:40:19,669
You dragged me out the base
with some killers after us...

313
00:40:19,705 --> 00:40:22,105
put me in a ball, take me
halfway around the world.

314
00:40:22,141 --> 00:40:24,200
If I'm gonna die today,
tell me why.

315
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:27,807
Nobody told me
why Johnny had to die.

316
00:40:28,714 --> 00:40:30,238
What is it with you?

317
00:40:30,283 --> 00:40:31,716
Who the hell is Johnny?

318
00:40:33,186 --> 00:40:34,778
I'm your partner.

319
00:40:34,855 --> 00:40:36,755
If you can't trust me,
who can you trust?

320
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:39,156
Nobody but me.

321
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:40,955
Nobody but you?

322
00:40:40,995 --> 00:40:43,828
Every time you needed me,
I was there.

323
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:46,526
I'm in the middle of nowhere
because of you!

324
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:51,032
I need to use the rest room.
I got no toilet tissue.

325
00:40:51,072 --> 00:40:53,632
I got metal on my hands!

326
00:41:34,183 --> 00:41:35,946
You wish.

327
00:43:00,775 --> 00:43:03,141
I told you these arms were good
for something.

328
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:10,550
Thanks.

329
00:43:13,523 --> 00:43:14,717
I owe you one.

330
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,953
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

331
00:43:16,992 --> 00:43:19,119
You look good in mud.

332
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:21,958
You do.

333
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:26,098
I got to find a river.

334
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,335
We better roll.

335
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:33,970
They don't use parachutes.

336
00:44:12,685 --> 00:44:15,586
I have come
to the eternal palace...

337
00:44:15,621 --> 00:44:18,385
because your sacred rules
have been broken.

338
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:26,157
Shao-Kahn has invaded the earth.

339
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:46,748
As always,
you are granted three questions.

340
00:44:50,158 --> 00:44:52,251
Why was this treachery allowed?

341
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:55,195
We do not control man's destiny.

342
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:58,666
Everyone can change their fate.

343
00:45:02,004 --> 00:45:04,472
You'll stand by and watch
the ruination of earth?

344
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,837
You are correct.

345
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:09,367
Kitana is the key
to closing Kahn's portals.

346
00:45:10,647 --> 00:45:13,275
If I reunite her with Sindel...

347
00:45:13,316 --> 00:45:16,808
how can I be sure Kahn's portals
will stay closed?

348
00:45:16,853 --> 00:45:21,119
Only when Shao-Kahn is destroyed
will the future be safe.

349
00:45:21,158 --> 00:45:25,595
Do you believe the humans
are worth saving?

350
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,326
More than anything I know.

351
00:45:28,365 --> 00:45:32,233
Do you love them enough
to sacrifice your immortality?

352
00:45:44,415 --> 00:45:46,440
I don't see street signs,
mailboxes.

353
00:45:46,485 --> 00:45:48,180
Which temple's the Elder Gods'?

354
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:49,744
Keep moving.

355
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:03,628
You know this dude?

356
00:46:08,408 --> 00:46:10,239
Is that Jax?

357
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:11,937
Who is she?

358
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:14,707
Jade, this is Sonya Blade.

359
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:17,813
Major Jackson Briggs.

360
00:46:18,785 --> 00:46:22,221
You've got incredible legs...
for kicking.

361
00:46:23,724 --> 00:46:25,316
Where Kitana?

362
00:46:27,361 --> 00:46:29,625
She was kidnapped by Scorpion.

363
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:31,893
You lost Kitana
and picked up her?

364
00:46:31,933 --> 00:46:33,491
She helped me get here.

365
00:46:35,102 --> 00:46:38,629
Thanks to you,
we got Kahn's squads on us.

366
00:46:38,673 --> 00:46:40,300
Can I make a suggestion?

367
00:46:40,375 --> 00:46:44,539
Let's worry about bigger things,
like staying alive.

368
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:14,875
He's not here, either.

369
00:47:14,945 --> 00:47:16,879
We're just gonna wait
for this dude?

370
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:18,438
Without Rayden, it's hopeless.

371
00:47:26,991 --> 00:47:28,754
Never give up hope.

372
00:47:32,430 --> 00:47:34,057
At least not so early.

373
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:36,400
It's a new look.

374
00:47:38,836 --> 00:47:41,464
Who's she? Can she fight
as good as she looks?

375
00:47:41,507 --> 00:47:42,997
Better.

376
00:47:43,042 --> 00:47:45,567
Good, because I was expecting
a team of fighters.

377
00:47:45,611 --> 00:47:48,102
Instead, I hear fighters
at war with each other.

378
00:47:48,147 --> 00:47:50,445
Give us a break.
We've been through hell.

379
00:47:50,516 --> 00:47:53,314
Compared to what lies ahead,
you've been through nothing.

380
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:55,948
Where's Kitana?

381
00:47:55,988 --> 00:47:58,582
Kahn took her.
It's all my fault.

382
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,593
This is not about blame.

383
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,322
We're together in this.

384
00:48:02,362 --> 00:48:06,822
Each of us must support
the others, like a family.

385
00:48:06,866 --> 00:48:08,094
What's with your arms?

386
00:48:08,134 --> 00:48:11,103
I've known you one minute,
and you're dissin' me already?

387
00:48:11,137 --> 00:48:13,002
I mean no disrespect.

388
00:48:13,039 --> 00:48:14,631
You have real skills.

389
00:48:14,675 --> 00:48:16,939
Those arms aren't your strength.
They're your weakness.

390
00:48:16,978 --> 00:48:18,343
Thanks for the tip.

391
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:21,576
These things
are state of the art.

392
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,584
Faith in yourself
is all you need.

393
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:26,484
I say that to all of you.

394
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:32,890
I'll try to open a portal
to Outworld.

395
00:48:32,928 --> 00:48:34,190
Follow me!

396
00:49:03,093 --> 00:49:04,958
My powers are leaving me.

397
00:49:07,964 --> 00:49:11,832
Who does he think he is,
Moses parting the Red Sea?

398
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,907
Destroy... everything!

399
00:49:37,997 --> 00:49:39,897
Whenever you're ready.

400
00:50:01,288 --> 00:50:02,846
Come on.

401
00:50:09,997 --> 00:50:12,090
That was fun.

402
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:16,229
They have taken the bait
and fallen into our trap.

403
00:50:16,270 --> 00:50:18,431
Proceed as planned.

404
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,805
I will await your arrival
in Outworld.

405
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:33,153
My skin is burning,
but I'm freezing inside.

406
00:50:33,188 --> 00:50:34,815
Feels like I got microwaved.

407
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:36,551
You never get used to that.

408
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:39,261
Is that what I think it is?

409
00:50:40,462 --> 00:50:42,589
The realms are merging.

410
00:50:42,632 --> 00:50:45,533
This will continue unless
Kahn's portals are closed.

411
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:48,361
Time is against us.

412
00:50:48,404 --> 00:50:51,134
- People in their cars...
- Torn between realms.

413
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:53,005
It's like a nightmare.

414
00:50:53,043 --> 00:50:54,704
We have to stop this.

415
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,707
To do that,
we must rescue Kitana.

416
00:51:00,084 --> 00:51:02,951
I know Kahn took Kitana
to his fortress.

417
00:51:02,986 --> 00:51:05,477
Hold up. Kahn?

418
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:07,081
You mean Mr. Bad Attitude?

419
00:51:07,124 --> 00:51:09,149
You want to check out his crib?

420
00:51:09,227 --> 00:51:11,195
No way.

421
00:51:11,228 --> 00:51:13,287
I ain't going
on no suicide mission.

422
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:16,364
Jax is right.

423
00:51:16,401 --> 00:51:18,835
That's probably
what Kahn wants us to do.

424
00:51:20,172 --> 00:51:22,106
There is a secret passageway.

425
00:51:22,841 --> 00:51:24,706
I used it to escape.

426
00:51:43,763 --> 00:51:46,323
How could you believe
the ruination of the temple...

427
00:51:46,399 --> 00:51:48,629
would not jeopardize our plan?

428
00:51:48,669 --> 00:51:50,899
It was necessary
to convince the mortals...

429
00:51:50,937 --> 00:51:53,098
their only hope lie in Outworld.

430
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:57,201
You seem confident that Sindel
will capture them in your trap.

431
00:51:57,244 --> 00:52:00,042
I promise you, on my soul.

432
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,379
All the millenniums of planning
will be rewarded.

433
00:52:03,418 --> 00:52:05,716
You will be proud.

434
00:52:05,753 --> 00:52:07,914
Know this...

435
00:52:07,955 --> 00:52:11,721
I will take your soul myself
if you fail.

436
00:52:14,830 --> 00:52:18,197
I will rally
the extermination squads...

437
00:52:18,233 --> 00:52:21,259
and prepare for victory.

438
00:52:21,337 --> 00:52:24,272
The merger
will soon be complete.

439
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:28,036
All your friends will be dead.

440
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:40,680
This must have been Edenia.

441
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:47,457
The royal family's temple.

442
00:52:47,531 --> 00:52:49,158
Kitana said I'd find it here.

443
00:52:54,805 --> 00:52:57,000
She's having a bad hair day.

444
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:11,851
They must have followed us.

445
00:53:16,094 --> 00:53:20,087
Perhaps, but it may be
a blessing in disguise.

446
00:53:20,133 --> 00:53:23,000
We need Sindel
to close Kahn's portals forever.

447
00:53:23,068 --> 00:53:26,196
- I'll take care of her.
- I'll rescue Kitana.

448
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:54,595
Something finally went right.
We won.

449
00:54:54,632 --> 00:54:56,600
Who finished off Sindel?

450
00:54:56,634 --> 00:55:00,400
After she blasted you,
I surprised her from behind.

451
00:55:01,406 --> 00:55:03,897
Maybe she came in handy
after all.

452
00:55:07,245 --> 00:55:13,707
You are witness to the dawning
of mankind's final day!

453
00:55:13,752 --> 00:55:17,711
The two realms will be one!

454
00:55:20,627 --> 00:55:25,030
Rayden and his mortals
have fallen for my trick...

455
00:55:25,063 --> 00:55:28,089
and failed to stop us.

456
00:55:28,134 --> 00:55:32,537
Bring Rayden and his mortals
to bow at my feet.

457
00:55:32,572 --> 00:55:38,568
With their dying breaths,
they can witness the birth...

458
00:55:38,646 --> 00:55:43,049
of the greatest army
in existence!

459
00:57:06,739 --> 00:57:08,707
It's a trap. Leave!

460
00:57:41,142 --> 00:57:42,609
Up there!

461
00:59:13,939 --> 00:59:15,804
The date's over.

462
00:59:36,463 --> 00:59:37,623
Only your love...

463
00:59:38,466 --> 00:59:40,457
can reunite her body and soul.

464
00:59:40,968 --> 00:59:42,128
Kitana...

465
00:59:42,471 --> 00:59:44,268
your love...

466
00:59:44,305 --> 00:59:46,773
can break the hold
Kahn has over your mother...

467
00:59:46,808 --> 00:59:48,776
and close his portals to earth.

468
01:00:23,247 --> 01:00:25,977
I have prayed for the day...

469
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:27,981
when our love...

470
01:00:28,018 --> 01:00:29,815
will bring us together again.

471
01:00:41,465 --> 01:00:44,332
I have never loved you.

472
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:47,827
With such a pathetic child,
what reason was there to love?

473
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:50,539
I knew it could not be true.

474
01:00:50,876 --> 01:00:52,173
It cannot be.

475
01:00:52,711 --> 01:00:56,477
But it can... and it is.

476
01:00:56,516 --> 01:00:59,883
And you are powerless...

477
01:00:59,919 --> 01:01:02,012
Thunder God.

478
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:09,923
It's over.

479
01:01:09,997 --> 01:01:11,589
You fools.

480
01:01:11,665 --> 01:01:13,257
You've been tricked.

481
01:01:13,333 --> 01:01:15,198
The legend was a lie.

482
01:01:15,235 --> 01:01:18,033
Kahn's portals stay open.

483
01:01:18,071 --> 01:01:21,529
Now the merger
is nearly complete.

484
01:01:21,576 --> 01:01:23,100
How could you do this?

485
01:01:25,445 --> 01:01:27,504
It was so easy.

486
01:01:29,417 --> 01:01:31,476
You will die for this, Jade.

487
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:10,992
That's it.

488
01:02:11,028 --> 01:02:12,325
We trusted you, man.

489
01:02:12,362 --> 01:02:13,727
And what happens?

490
01:02:13,763 --> 01:02:15,754
You take us
on a wild goose chase.

491
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,825
I don't understand.

492
01:02:17,902 --> 01:02:20,200
You were advised
by the other gods.

493
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,305
The gods must've lied to me.

494
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,967
Forget your gods...

495
01:02:24,008 --> 01:02:25,305
and immortals...

496
01:02:25,343 --> 01:02:27,140
and all that junk!

497
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:30,478
The only ones we can trust
from here on out are humans.

498
01:02:30,514 --> 01:02:32,948
Nobody else, not even Rayden.

499
01:02:32,985 --> 01:02:34,111
Don't you understand?

500
01:02:34,152 --> 01:02:37,451
By leading us here,
he is mortal now like you.

501
01:02:37,489 --> 01:02:39,582
All his powers
have been sacrificed.

502
01:02:39,625 --> 01:02:40,751
That's even worse.

503
01:02:40,792 --> 01:02:42,589
How do we stop Kahn now?

504
01:02:42,629 --> 01:02:44,654
There's more to this than Kahn.

505
01:02:45,831 --> 01:02:48,698
If Sindel is not the key
to closing Kahn's portals,

506
01:02:48,768 --> 01:02:50,736
then Kahn
has a higher allegiance.

507
01:02:52,204 --> 01:02:53,398
Wait a second.

508
01:02:53,873 --> 01:02:55,864
That tattoo.
I've seen it before.

509
01:02:56,242 --> 01:02:58,005
On a robot and a woman.

510
01:02:58,044 --> 01:02:59,841
They both tried to kill me.

511
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,871
And both of them
worked for Kahn.

512
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,288
This tattoo is a family crest...

513
01:03:08,788 --> 01:03:10,779
bestowed only to my bloodline.

514
01:03:12,126 --> 01:03:13,559
It is a permanent mark...

515
01:03:13,594 --> 01:03:15,755
that allows safe passage
through the portals...

516
01:03:15,797 --> 01:03:17,856
for the bearer
and his passengers.

517
01:03:17,898 --> 01:03:21,095
Did the tattoos you saw
flee the fighter upon death?

518
01:03:21,169 --> 01:03:22,727
Like a bat out of hell.

519
01:03:22,804 --> 01:03:24,431
Temporary passes.

520
01:03:24,506 --> 01:03:26,337
The did not share my bloodline.

521
01:03:26,374 --> 01:03:28,569
But if it's your family crest...

522
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:30,771
how can Kahn's side
have it, too?

523
01:03:31,513 --> 01:03:33,504
My father is an Elder God.

524
01:03:34,015 --> 01:03:36,279
And only they can bestow
such a marking.

525
01:03:36,851 --> 01:03:38,944
Your dad's an Elder God?

526
01:03:43,326 --> 01:03:45,988
Funny how you failed
to mention that before.

527
01:03:48,966 --> 01:03:51,161
If your father's an Elder God...

528
01:03:52,501 --> 01:03:54,128
what does that make Kahn?

529
01:04:02,212 --> 01:04:03,907
Shao-Kahn is my brother.

530
01:04:16,961 --> 01:04:18,428
It was not my fault.

531
01:04:18,463 --> 01:04:20,522
I did everything you ordered.

532
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,931
It was your job
to lure them to an ambush.

533
01:04:22,967 --> 01:04:26,198
If they escaped,
then you failed me!

534
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,603
We could never
have stopped them alone.

535
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:29,937
Listen to her.

536
01:04:30,008 --> 01:04:31,475
She speaks the truth.

537
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:33,407
We would've died trying.

538
01:04:33,445 --> 01:04:34,844
You.

539
01:04:35,848 --> 01:04:37,679
You are already dead!

540
01:04:39,852 --> 01:04:40,876
And you...

541
01:04:42,021 --> 01:04:43,511
will be soon.

542
01:04:57,504 --> 01:05:00,302
You will mount a defense
around my newest temple.

543
01:05:00,341 --> 01:05:03,139
Prepare for Rayden to make
one last attack.

544
01:05:03,209 --> 01:05:05,700
You said Rayden
was no longer to be feared.

545
01:05:05,780 --> 01:05:07,611
I am to be feared!

546
01:05:07,648 --> 01:05:09,013
If you fail me...

547
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:11,610
I will feed
your rotting corpse...

548
01:05:11,652 --> 01:05:12,983
to the worms!

549
01:05:17,392 --> 01:05:20,953
Your hallowed position
atop the worm pile...

550
01:05:20,996 --> 01:05:23,624
appears to be most tenuous.

551
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:29,002
Now your failure
will be my opportunity.

552
01:05:36,178 --> 01:05:38,840
Man, you got
one dysfunctional family.

553
01:05:38,915 --> 01:05:41,315
Years ago,
my father decreed...

554
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:44,786
his heir to the family throne
must be strong enough...

555
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:47,721
to kill his own brother
in battle if necessary.

556
01:05:48,926 --> 01:05:50,689
I beat my brother...

557
01:05:51,861 --> 01:05:53,385
but I could not kill him.

558
01:05:53,429 --> 01:05:55,329
Only one thing is certain.

559
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,933
Kahn must die.

560
01:05:58,836 --> 01:06:00,360
This time you'll kill him.

561
01:06:01,038 --> 01:06:02,528
I could not then.

562
01:06:03,507 --> 01:06:04,872
I cannot now.

563
01:06:04,909 --> 01:06:07,434
So what do we do?

564
01:06:07,479 --> 01:06:09,538
You will do your best.

565
01:06:09,947 --> 01:06:11,744
It is all that can be expected.

566
01:06:11,816 --> 01:06:13,408
I will pray for you all.

567
01:06:16,821 --> 01:06:18,083
Listen to me.

568
01:06:18,123 --> 01:06:19,784
Liu is our only hope.

569
01:06:22,828 --> 01:06:24,523
I want to fight Kahn...

570
01:06:24,562 --> 01:06:26,291
but I may not be ready.

571
01:06:26,331 --> 01:06:28,231
You must believe in yourself.

572
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,163
We believe in you.

573
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:10,937
My home.

574
01:07:12,781 --> 01:07:14,942
The Temple
of the Order of Light.

575
01:07:15,316 --> 01:07:16,613
Your family.

576
01:07:17,986 --> 01:07:19,954
There's so little time left.

577
01:07:20,989 --> 01:07:22,957
Whatever time we have...

578
01:07:22,991 --> 01:07:24,458
we must use well.

579
01:07:25,661 --> 01:07:27,822
Are we really ready to die here?

580
01:07:30,165 --> 01:07:31,325
If we die...

581
01:07:32,335 --> 01:07:33,825
we will die in battle.

582
01:07:35,471 --> 01:07:36,631
Together.

583
01:08:35,668 --> 01:08:39,229
Prepare for final battle!

584
01:08:46,713 --> 01:08:48,647
So good of you to join us, son.

585
01:08:50,351 --> 01:08:53,787
In under one hour, the merger
of realms will be complete.

586
01:08:53,820 --> 01:08:56,812
Father, you alone
have the power to end this.

587
01:08:56,858 --> 01:08:57,825
Stop!

588
01:08:58,359 --> 01:09:00,987
I do not want to remember you
this weak!

589
01:09:01,062 --> 01:09:03,462
It is not weak to value life!

590
01:09:05,467 --> 01:09:09,528
I offer you one final chance
to return to my side, Rayden.

591
01:09:10,305 --> 01:09:13,206
To rule all realms
with your family.

592
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:19,679
They are my family.

593
01:09:20,616 --> 01:09:24,712
Then you shall die with the rest
of your pathetic human race!

594
01:09:24,753 --> 01:09:25,742
Finish him!

595
01:09:26,956 --> 01:09:28,947
You should have killed me...

596
01:09:30,627 --> 01:09:32,618
when you had the chance...

597
01:09:33,463 --> 01:09:34,430
brother.

598
01:09:34,831 --> 01:09:37,163
My brother died a long time ago.

599
01:09:38,002 --> 01:09:39,469
His heart, anyway.

600
01:09:53,884 --> 01:09:55,374
I win...

601
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:56,819
brother.

602
01:10:12,538 --> 01:10:14,870
You cannot die.

603
01:10:16,042 --> 01:10:18,033
I am proud to die...

604
01:10:19,045 --> 01:10:20,205
a mortal.

605
01:10:23,683 --> 01:10:24,843
Like you.

606
01:10:46,707 --> 01:10:50,234
This is the beginning
of the end!

607
01:10:51,079 --> 01:10:53,047
Show them the way...

608
01:10:53,081 --> 01:10:55,049
to oblivion!

609
01:10:58,086 --> 01:10:59,610
Mr. Ed is mine.

610
01:11:03,558 --> 01:11:04,786
I'll take my mother.

611
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:10,730
Leftovers are fine with me.

612
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:19,868
I'll make you eat that thing.

613
01:11:32,355 --> 01:11:34,346
I can't take
too much more of this.

614
01:11:37,527 --> 01:11:38,994
Is that all you got?

615
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:51,641
Is that any way
to treat your mother?

616
01:11:51,676 --> 01:11:53,143
My mother's dead.

617
01:11:53,177 --> 01:11:55,111
As soon will be her daughter.

618
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:18,701
That just leaves
you and me, Kahn.

619
01:12:55,378 --> 01:12:57,710
Pathetic and weak.

620
01:12:57,746 --> 01:13:00,943
Clearly Rayden has molded you
in his image.

621
01:13:34,552 --> 01:13:36,179
Without your weapons...

622
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:38,051
you are no match for Motaro.

623
01:14:42,223 --> 01:14:44,555
Jax, help!

624
01:14:48,196 --> 01:14:50,187
I got everything I need
right here!

625
01:15:22,634 --> 01:15:23,828
Help!

626
01:15:25,302 --> 01:15:26,326
Get off her.

627
01:15:35,880 --> 01:15:37,211
Get down, Sonya.

628
01:15:39,451 --> 01:15:41,919
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

629
01:15:41,953 --> 01:15:44,353
So you finally got
your confidence back, huh?

630
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:46,221
Finally asked for help, huh?

631
01:15:47,059 --> 01:15:48,526
Whatever you are...

632
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,858
you will live
to see the end of Kahn...

633
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:53,558
to give my mother's soul peace.

634
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,638
Face it, Liu Kang.

635
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:09,813
You will fail!

636
01:16:17,358 --> 01:16:19,986
I can feel...

637
01:16:30,471 --> 01:16:32,063
Now I done seen everything.

638
01:16:35,410 --> 01:16:36,809
Impressive.

639
01:16:36,844 --> 01:16:38,505
You've come prepared.

640
01:16:39,081 --> 01:16:41,447
But not good enough.

641
01:17:53,626 --> 01:17:55,093
Your blood flows, Kahn.

642
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:57,392
Just like the blood of a mortal.

643
01:18:00,233 --> 01:18:01,723
How can this be?

644
01:18:02,402 --> 01:18:05,132
I warned you
there would be consequences...

645
01:18:05,172 --> 01:18:07,470
for breaking the sacred rules.

646
01:18:07,507 --> 01:18:09,805
But I did not expect this.

647
01:18:09,843 --> 01:18:11,970
Must I do everything for you?

648
01:18:33,535 --> 01:18:36,003
The fate of the universe...

649
01:18:36,038 --> 01:18:39,337
will be decided as it should be.

650
01:18:39,375 --> 01:18:42,173
In Mortal Kombat.

651
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:13,169
Nothing can alter your destiny,
nor mine!

652
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:18,310
I can, and I will!

653
01:21:25,717 --> 01:21:28,049
That was the longest week
of my life.

654
01:21:28,087 --> 01:21:29,679
Oh, come on, Jax.

655
01:21:29,722 --> 01:21:30,848
Could've been worse.

656
01:21:30,889 --> 01:21:33,084
Could've been the last week
of our lives.

657
01:21:33,125 --> 01:21:34,558
I guess that's right.

658
01:21:37,063 --> 01:21:38,724
What's up with that?

659
01:22:01,123 --> 01:22:02,215
Was I dead?

660
01:22:02,257 --> 01:22:04,384
It is only right
that Shinnok's son...

661
01:22:04,425 --> 01:22:07,986
be allowed to take his place
in the Eternal Palace.

662
01:22:08,029 --> 01:22:10,361
You've become one of us.

I will never forget
this moment, Liu.

664
01:22:29,085 --> 01:22:31,417
You've all made me very proud.

01:22:35,391 --> 01:22:36,881
I will be watching you...

666
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,050
so stay out of trouble.

667
01:22:41,398 --> 01:22:42,422
And remember...

668
01:22:43,399 --> 01:22:44,866
be there for one another.

01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:48,867
You're a family now.
