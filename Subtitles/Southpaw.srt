1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:29,055
There you go.

3
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:49,609
You go back to
the fuckin' shelter.

4
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:52,579
You smell like the fuckin'
third floor of the shelter.

5
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:56,148
Yeah, we back... we back
in the dressing room now, yeah.

6
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:58,250
The Commission in here.
They... wrap...

7
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,086
watch-watching 'em wrap
Billy hands.

8
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:03,656
Yeah, it's all right.

9
00:02:16,068 --> 00:02:17,804
Yeah, but once he gets
in the inside, it's over.

10
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:19,572
Make that step, it's over.

11
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:55,575
Yeah. I'll text you
as soon as he's done, okay?

12
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:56,909
Yeah. I love you, too.

13
00:02:56,943 --> 00:02:58,177
Hi, Jordan.

14
00:02:58,210 --> 00:02:59,846
Okay. Yeah. Do your homework.

15
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:01,280
Hey, y'all
give him a minute.

16
00:03:01,313 --> 00:03:03,850
- Hey, hey, guys.
- Hey, Mo. What's up?

17
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,184
What's up?

18
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:06,953
Yeah, let's get out.

19
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,098
Hey.

20
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,371
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

21
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:26,873
You're ready.

22
00:03:28,507 --> 00:03:30,810
Don't get hit too much.

23
00:03:47,193 --> 00:03:51,063
Hard shots from Darius Jones

24
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,099
to the body and the head,

25
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:55,401
as he continues putting distance

26
00:03:55,434 --> 00:04:00,106
between himself and Billy Hope
on the scorecards.

27
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:02,041
This kid Jones is super fast,

28
00:04:02,074 --> 00:04:05,244
and he's killing Billy
with just his left hand.

29
00:04:05,277 --> 00:04:08,147
Jones,
a longer, quicker fighter,

30
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,182
has appeared to win
most of the rounds

31
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,184
to this point in the fight.

32
00:04:12,218 --> 00:04:14,120
Keep them hands up!
Protect that eye!

33
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,455
Come on, chief!
Come on, move!

34
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,926
There you go!

35
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,895
And the crowd comes alive
as Hope lands a right and a left.

36
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,097
Okay, here we go,
here we go.

37
00:04:26,799 --> 00:04:28,735
Good body shots by Hope.

38
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,536
- Dance with me, bitch.
- Let him go.

39
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:31,838
There he goes
again with that attitude.

40
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,572
He never stops.

41
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,541
It's another
frustrating round for Hope.

42
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:37,844
He all right.
He ain't hurt him.

43
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,749
It's give and take,
ebb and flow,

44
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,316
here in this fight.

45
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,452
Come on, Billy,
turn the shit back!

46
00:04:46,485 --> 00:04:48,621
As Jones drives him back

47
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,556
- with another uppercut.
- Whoa, good uppercut.

48
00:04:50,589 --> 00:04:52,358
And now Jones again
going to the body...

49
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:54,060
Come on, baby,
get off those ropes!

50
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:55,695
...trying to set up the finish

51
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,797
as he drives Hope back
into the ropes again.

52
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,832
I got you, man. I got you.

53
00:04:59,866 --> 00:05:01,668
- Huh? That's all you got?
- Uh-huh.

54
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,803
That's all you got, huh?

55
00:05:05,371 --> 00:05:07,373
Watching,
close to Hope's corner,

56
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:10,342
his beautiful wife, Maureen,

57
00:05:10,376 --> 00:05:13,479
herself a product
of a Hell's Kitchen orphanage.

58
00:05:13,512 --> 00:05:16,515
- How's the eye?
- Take many more, it's gonna flow.

59
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:18,350
Yeah, just fix
the fuckin' eye.

60
00:05:18,384 --> 00:05:20,386
State Commission
doctor taking a good look

61
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:24,023
at Hope's left eye
in the corner.

62
00:05:24,056 --> 00:05:26,092
But the fight will continue.

63
00:05:26,125 --> 00:05:28,895
We've seen Billy Hope
win fights in the past

64
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:32,264
looking even more the worse
for wear than is the case here.

65
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:34,100
Nothing has changed tonight.

66
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,802
Seated at ringside,

67
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,370
light heavyweight contender
Miguel "Magic" Escobar,

68
00:05:38,404 --> 00:05:40,172
who would love
to fight the winner.

69
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,408
Okay, keep him on
the end of your stick.

70
00:05:42,441 --> 00:05:44,343
And don't stand
in front of him.

71
00:05:44,376 --> 00:05:47,680
Get yours, relocate. It's like
the bull and the matador.

72
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,382
This is your fuckin' ring.
You're the fuckin' champ, right?

73
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:52,051
Just go back in and do what
we do; you gotta end this.

74
00:05:52,084 --> 00:05:53,619
Hey, Billy. Billy.

75
00:05:53,652 --> 00:05:55,988
All right, do me a favor
and keep those hands up.

76
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,124
Billy, stay focused.

77
00:05:58,157 --> 00:06:01,060
End it. You don't have time
for this bullshit.

78
00:06:01,093 --> 00:06:02,494
Put an end to this
so we can go the fuck home.

79
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,163
What do you think
I'm trying to do, Eli?

80
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,698
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

81
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,566
Get the shit off my eye!
Let's go! Come on!

82
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,971
Round ten about to begin.

83
00:06:17,109 --> 00:06:19,345
Watch that jab, watch the jab.

84
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:23,716
Billy Hope still
with that bleeding left eye.

85
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:28,187
Those who love him would say,
"Defense? What is that?"

86
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,655
- And a hard right cross!
- Yeah, Hope hurt him!

87
00:06:29,688 --> 00:06:31,390
That's it, baby,
that's it.

88
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,159
Good body shot by Darius Jones.

89
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,727
Giving Hope
a little of his medicine,

90
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,595
he comes back to the body
a second time.

91
00:06:36,628 --> 00:06:38,430
He hurt Hope
with that body shot.

92
00:06:38,464 --> 00:06:40,632
Hard right by Hope
drives Jones

93
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:42,434
back into the ropes.

94
00:06:42,468 --> 00:06:44,203
Let him go. Let him go.

95
00:06:44,236 --> 00:06:45,805
That's one
of the best clean shots

96
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,474
Hope has landed
since the middle of the fight.

97
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,843
And down goes Jones
on a left hook.

98
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,611
Three...

99
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:55,481
- four, five...
- Tremendous turnaround

100
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:57,616
in favor of Hope,
here in round ten.

101
00:06:57,649 --> 00:07:00,119
- Come to me, come to me.
- Wow, what a shot!

102
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,054
You stay on him, Billy,
stay on him.

103
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,190
- Are you good? You good? All right.
- I'm good. I'm good.

104
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:05,758
Tony Weeks is
gonna let him keep fighting.

105
00:07:05,792 --> 00:07:07,659
- Oh!
- But not for long!

106
00:07:07,693 --> 00:07:12,364
And another right hand
may have ended the fight.

107
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,666
...six, seven...

108
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,802
eight...

109
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,269
nine...

110
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,805
That's it.

111
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,440
This is over!

112
00:07:21,473 --> 00:07:23,943
A comeback knockout win
for Billy Hope.

113
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,146
I told you, Jim,
as long as there's a Billy,

114
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,782
there is Hope...
He always has a chance.

115
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,517
So light heavyweight
champ Billy Hope

116
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,920
has a fourth consecutive
title defense

117
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,355
in Madison Square Garden.

118
00:07:36,388 --> 00:07:38,324
Let's go to David Diamante

119
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:40,626
for the official particulars
on the KO.

120
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:43,996
Ladies and gentlemen, from
the world's most famous arena,

121
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,599
Madison Square Garden, the
official time of the stoppage:

122
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:51,737
one minute and 18 seconds
of round number ten.

123
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,073
Your winner by knockout,

124
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,608
still undefeated and still

125
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,812
the undisputed WBC,

126
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:03,182
WBA, WBO,

127
00:08:03,215 --> 00:08:08,720
and IBF Light Heavyweight
Champion of the World...

128
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:14,293
Billy "The Great" Hope!

129
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:17,930
He reminds us of the
great, late Matthew Saad Muhammad.

130
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:22,101
Just when you think there's no
hope left, here comes Billy.

131
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:24,837
From an orphanage
in Hell's Kitchen

132
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:29,075
to a professional career fighting
in Madison Square Garden

133
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:34,480
is a distance of only a few blocks...
and a million miles.

134
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,583
But it's a journey Billy Hope
has made in his life.

135
00:08:37,616 --> 00:08:40,652
Billy! Billy! Billy!

136
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:52,932
Hey, Jon Jon,

137
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,267
take the belts out for
the press conference, yeah?

138
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:57,836
- The new one?
- With the other ones in the back of the car.

139
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,805
Yo, I'll bring that, Mikey.
You bring that one.

140
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:02,374
- See you at the press conference.
- Come on, Big Mike.

141
00:09:02,408 --> 00:09:05,611
- We got a press conference.
- All right, we'll see you there.

142
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,415
Thanks, Eli.

143
00:09:20,659 --> 00:09:21,894
Hey.

144
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,862
- No.
- I don't know what that is...

145
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,631
- Come here.
- I'm bleeding out of my mouth, baby.

146
00:09:25,664 --> 00:09:27,066
I don't know
when it's coming clean.

147
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,800
What's that, baby?

148
00:09:32,304 --> 00:09:33,739
- What'd you say?
- It's fine, babe.

149
00:09:33,772 --> 00:09:35,174
You want some water?

150
00:09:35,207 --> 00:09:37,609
Yeah. I'm just gonna
take a shower first.

151
00:09:37,643 --> 00:09:39,311
No, no, no.

152
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:40,846
Can you get
your socks off?

153
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:42,314
Yourself?

154
00:09:42,348 --> 00:09:44,716
Yeah. I'll just fuckin'
shower in 'em.

155
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,665
Billy!

156
00:09:59,698 --> 00:10:02,401
- Okay, Mike, go ahead.
- Billy, most of us here

157
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:04,170
had you winning this early.

158
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:05,938
Were you expecting
such a difficult fight?

159
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,674
Oh. Heh.
Yeah, I don't know, "expect"?

160
00:10:08,707 --> 00:10:11,043
I don't know.
You can't expect anything.

161
00:10:11,077 --> 00:10:14,680
Um, I-I was really looking
forward to just showing up,

162
00:10:14,713 --> 00:10:17,249
walk in the ring, and then
having him fall on the ground.

163
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:20,852
Billy. Hey, Billy.

164
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,688
No, man, I mean...

165
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:25,691
I expected a hard fight.
You know? Um...

166
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,060
I put my family
through a lot. Uh...

167
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,695
by the way, Leila,

168
00:10:29,728 --> 00:10:31,330
if you're watching,
go to sleep, baby.

169
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,334
Billy. Hey, Billy, Billy.

170
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:39,771
Billy. You're 43 and 0... undefeated.
Are you running out of legitimate...

171
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:41,974
Sorry, can you say that again?

172
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:44,510
It's impressive.

173
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:46,712
But who are you gonna fight?
Who are you gonna fight?

174
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:49,115
- Uh, you know, that's really Jordan and me...
- I think I know one!

175
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,782
Me!

176
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:55,921
I mean, all the fans around the
world, they want to see it.

177
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:58,690
Y'all tell me, who else is there?
Your crew knows it.

178
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,859
All these beautiful people
in here know it.

179
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:04,763
I know it. I just want to know
why you won't give me my shot.

180
00:11:04,796 --> 00:11:06,532
All I want is my shot.
I just want my shot.

181
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:08,667
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Who are you?

182
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,103
You know exactly
who I am, baby.

183
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,772
- He's just trying to make a fight.
- And you're that contender?

184
00:11:13,805 --> 00:11:15,741
You ain't never been hit
by a real man.

185
00:11:15,774 --> 00:11:17,509
All right?

186
00:11:17,543 --> 00:11:20,479
Who's got that...

187
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,815
It's pretty clear that he hasn't
really been hit at all yet, huh?

188
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,984
What are you drinking in that cup, man?

189
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,586
Hey, you know what?
You ain't no champ.

190
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:29,521
You're all show
and you know that.

191
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,357
Why you so scared
to fight me, Billy?

192
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,525
We all came and gave
a good show tonight,

193
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:37,029
didn't we, Jordan? Yeah? And I'm pretty
sure we did business, didn't we?

194
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:39,598
Yeah, all right.
Y'all have a good night, okay?

195
00:11:39,631 --> 00:11:42,134
Sign the contract, baby!

196
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,870
- Gonna be a fight, Billy?
- Just sign the contract, baby!

197
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:46,605
Is there going to be a fight?

198
00:11:46,638 --> 00:11:49,007
- I want you to line it up!
- Line it up?

199
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,442
Miguel's just
showboating, Billy.

200
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:52,378
I'm gonna shut him the fuck up.

201
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:54,580
Line it up.

202
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:56,682
Turay just makes sense.
If it makes money,

203
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,450
it makes sense. Two for the
bills, one for the belt.

204
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,419
The Turay fight
makes better sense.

205
00:12:00,452 --> 00:12:02,588
No, no, no. You think
Miguel's a better fighter?

206
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:04,656
No. I didn't say that.
I didn't say that.

207
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,858
What do I got to do? What do
I got to do, say it again?

208
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,927
- You want me to say it again?
- You want to fight me?

209
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,730
Do you want to say it again?
What do you want me to do?

210
00:12:11,763 --> 00:12:13,203
Why do you do this
in front of all...

211
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:16,968
What happened?

212
00:12:17,002 --> 00:12:20,206
- What's the problem, Billy?
- Hey, yo, yo, I'm sorry.

213
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:22,808
I'm sorry about that.

214
00:12:22,841 --> 00:12:24,576
- I'll just...
- Don't worry about it. Go on.

215
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:27,045
- Just, come on, man.
- Don't worry about this.

216
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:23,435
I want
to get you out of this dress.

217
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,671
Yeah, me, too.
You have no idea.

218
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,139
Hey, Lee,
put those in the office.

219
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,141
- Ugh!
- Come on. Come with me.

220
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:31,877
- Come with me. Where you going?
- What?

221
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,213
- Come with me.
- Let me put my stuff down.

222
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:35,647
I got to get
you some ice...

223
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,183
- Leila?
- And some food...

224
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,584
Leila?

225
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,085
Hey, hey. Shh.

226
00:13:40,118 --> 00:13:41,653
She might be sleeping.

227
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:43,355
- Leila...
- Hey.

228
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:45,324
- How's it going, Gloria?
- Congratulations, Mr. Billy.

229
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,025
Is she up? Is she up?

230
00:13:47,058 --> 00:13:49,595
Yeah, she's probably
still waiting up for you.

231
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,063
Tell me she didn't
watch that fight.

232
00:13:57,068 --> 00:13:58,870
Oh, I saw you.

233
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,105
I saw you.

234
00:14:00,138 --> 00:14:01,840
Don't try and fool me.

235
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:04,476
I'm coming for my hug.

236
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,479
Hey, wake up.

237
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,815
Aw! You... Yeah... Oh.

238
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:11,450
Hi, baby.

239
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:14,320
Oh, I missed you so much.

240
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,722
I missed you, Daddy.

241
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:21,227
Can I count?

242
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,694
Mm-hmm.

243
00:14:26,164 --> 00:14:28,133
That's a big one.

244
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,435
Yeah.

245
00:14:30,302 --> 00:14:32,070
Mm.

246
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,141
Eight.

247
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,476
Mm.

248
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,778
- You got hit a lot, Dad.
- Yeah,

249
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,079
you should see the other guy.

250
00:14:41,112 --> 00:14:42,514
No, she should not.

251
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:44,015
- Aw.
- She needs to go to bed.

252
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,751
And so do you. Come on.

253
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,953
Party's over. Come on.

254
00:14:47,986 --> 00:14:50,021
Why can't I go
see the fights?

255
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,623
Oh, 'cause your mother
thinks they're too...

256
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:53,325
Why can't she go
to your fights?

257
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,461
Your mom thinks they're
too violent, baby, come on.

258
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,629
But I see stuff like that
on TV all the time.

259
00:14:57,663 --> 00:14:59,465
- I know you do.
- What do you mean?

260
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:00,932
I watch "The Walking Dead"
with Gloria.

261
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,634
All right,
that's gonna stop.

262
00:15:02,668 --> 00:15:04,470
You, up. Come on,
this is your hint.

263
00:15:04,503 --> 00:15:06,805
- Okay, all right.
- Come on.

264
00:15:06,838 --> 00:15:08,507
Time for bed.
Please... no...

265
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,941
- Dad will let me.
- She has a phone?

266
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:11,610
She's had a phone
for two months.

267
00:15:11,643 --> 00:15:13,211
Why are you looking at me
like I'm crazy?

268
00:15:13,245 --> 00:15:15,146
'Cause you asked me
to get her the phone?

269
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,715
- Get a ten-year-old a phone?
- Out, out, out.

270
00:15:16,748 --> 00:15:18,183
Do you have
the pass code on it?

271
00:15:18,216 --> 00:15:19,818
Dad would say yes.

272
00:15:19,851 --> 00:15:22,821
Well, sometimes I think
your daddy confuses you

273
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:25,791
with the other children who
hang around him night and day.

274
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:27,459
You're talking
about Mikey and Jon Jon, right?

275
00:15:27,493 --> 00:15:28,960
That's right, baby.

276
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:30,529
Mm...
I love you so much.

277
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:31,663
I'm serious.

278
00:15:31,697 --> 00:15:33,465
Okay. Come on. Bedtime.

279
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,233
Hey, get away
from my daughter.

280
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,802
You, get out.
Get out.

281
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:38,404
Go away, Dad.

282
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:41,473
Good night.

283
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,309
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

284
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,010
What would you like?

285
00:15:45,043 --> 00:15:48,647
I want...
I want to take a break.

286
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,318
I was just thinking we could
maybe blow off the Turay match,

287
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,653
rethink things, pick a fight

288
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:57,856
- for later next year, you know.
- Wait a minute.

289
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,257
Why?

290
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,293
I didn't like
what I saw tonight.

291
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,229
What did you see tonight?
You saw me win tonight.

292
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:05,631
Baby, look at your face.

293
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:06,932
What are you talking about?

294
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,569
Look at your face.

295
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,239
Baby, what are you saying?

296
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:17,843
Hey, baby,
can I ask you something?

297
00:16:17,876 --> 00:16:19,745
- What?
- What if I said this...

298
00:16:19,778 --> 00:16:21,847
"Look at your face.
Look at your face,"

299
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,616
and then I started
crying? Okay?

300
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:27,353
I'm sorry.

301
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:28,820
Nah, it's-it's all good.

302
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:30,322
- I'm sorry, but...
- It's good.

303
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:31,723
...you fucking scared me.

304
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:33,525
You can't fight
like that anymore.

305
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,327
Baby, we... we won tonight.

306
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,229
Yeah, but it's the way
you're fighting.

307
00:16:40,131 --> 00:16:42,334
- What are you talking about?
- Oh...

308
00:16:43,935 --> 00:16:46,071
The way I fight
bought us this house

309
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,139
and bought you that
fucking beautiful dress.

310
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,675
Yes, I know. I know.

311
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,410
And it gave Leila
that fucking private school.

312
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:53,845
- I know, baby. I know.
- All the shit in this house.

313
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,847
Our fucking life,
that's what my fighting bought.

314
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,583
But I want to enjoy it.

315
00:16:57,616 --> 00:16:59,618
- Where is this coming from?
- With you.

316
00:17:03,955 --> 00:17:06,825
This is the talk you have when
you lose, not when you win.

317
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:10,896
The more you get hit,
the harder you fight. I get it.

318
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,364
I don't want to hear
this right now.

319
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,232
Only now you're taking
way too many hits

320
00:17:14,265 --> 00:17:16,234
- before you get off.
- Hey. Listen to me.

321
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,836
This was a good night...

322
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:20,672
I love you.
You are all I care about.

323
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,474
The three of us, that's it.

324
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,875
That's all that matters.

325
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:25,511
So I'm going to tell you
the truth.

326
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,447
You're going to be punch-drunk
in two years

327
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,348
if you keep this up.

328
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,821
Think about her.

329
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,790
When she graduates,
what do you want to look like?

330
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,994
Fuck me.

331
00:17:43,028 --> 00:17:44,663
Fuck.

332
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:49,034
Why do you got to lay

333
00:17:49,067 --> 00:17:51,102
the fucking truth right now?

334
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,138
Fuck.

335
00:17:53,171 --> 00:17:54,940
You say it,
I'll do it, all right?

336
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,008
You say it, I'll do it.

337
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:02,848
Come here, baby.

338
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,951
They're all gonna keep you in that
"Billy the Great" bubble, you know?

339
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,753
And they'll take
their pound of flesh,

340
00:18:07,786 --> 00:18:10,522
but, baby, when
that bubble pops,

341
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:14,560
they're all just gonna
scatter like roaches.

342
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:18,530
And me and Leila are gonna
be here to pick up the pieces.

343
00:18:18,564 --> 00:18:20,699
There are no pieces.

344
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:26,938
I know.

345
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:29,941
Hey, you know what?

346
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:31,777
- What?
- I wanna know...

347
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,045
- you know how I only went ten rounds?
- What's that?

348
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:37,549
I only went ten rounds tonight,
so do you know what that means?

349
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:40,085
Mmm... what does that mean?

350
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:43,121
That means that I still have...

351
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:47,759
...two rounds left in me.

352
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,294
Oh.

353
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:52,030
You want to go two rounds
with me, champ?

354
00:18:52,063 --> 00:18:52,898
Mm-hmm.

355
00:18:52,931 --> 00:18:55,200
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

356
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:57,402
- That's very impressive.
- Mmm.

357
00:18:57,435 --> 00:18:59,571
Very brave.

358
00:19:05,711 --> 00:19:07,278
- Good.
- Good.

359
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,714
Wow.

360
00:19:25,463 --> 00:19:27,766
Oh, fuck. Baby.

361
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,167
Ow...

362
00:19:31,637 --> 00:19:32,838
Fuck...

363
00:20:08,974 --> 00:20:11,409
Uncle J, watch!

364
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:15,446
That's another gold medal
in your future, missy.

365
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,583
- Flip a little higher.
- No, no, no!

366
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,718
No. No, no, no... no flips.

367
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:21,086
Not too high, baby.

368
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,954
- Yeah, she's good.
- Heh heh.

369
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:27,125
Oh, I got, uh,
got a few things for you.

370
00:20:27,158 --> 00:20:29,094
I put that together
for the people over at HBO.

371
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,196
It's a two-year,
three-fight deal.

372
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:32,363
Mm-hmm.

373
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,432
Hey, whoever wins...

374
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,801
whoever wins...

375
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,706
- ...gets one of these.
- Again with the gifts?

376
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,073
How much you spend
on this shit?

377
00:20:42,107 --> 00:20:43,742
Oh, shit, you all just won.

378
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:45,343
Oh, yo, I owe some shit
to the government.

379
00:20:45,376 --> 00:20:47,212
Let me hock this shit.
Nah, just playing.

380
00:20:47,245 --> 00:20:48,914
Yo, is this the shit
with the bezel right here?

381
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,548
Yo, this shit with the bezel?

382
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,217
Yeah, Gabe, it got the bezel
just like the last deal.

383
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,019
Ooh! Oh, this shit
got the bezel on it.

384
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:55,754
You don't got these shits
in, like, big-boy sizes?

385
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:57,956
- I win, you win. All right?
- That's too much.

386
00:20:57,989 --> 00:21:00,091
It's not gonna happen.

387
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,993
Maureen, Billy's been
my fighter for ten years.

388
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,995
I know what's best for him.

389
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:05,864
And I've been his wife
for, like, a hundred.

390
00:21:05,897 --> 00:21:07,565
I know what's better for him.

391
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,434
Come on, he needs time off.

392
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:11,502
To do what? Sit on a beach
and watch the sun go down?

393
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:13,805
- Yeah.
- How long he gonna do that, Mo?

394
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:17,375
One week? Two weeks? Then he's
gonna start looking around.

395
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:19,310
He'll fuck around
and bite his hand off

396
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:20,812
if you don't give him something
else to do with them.

397
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,480
Are you...

398
00:21:22,513 --> 00:21:24,015
Are you hustling me?

399
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:25,751
We've been friends a long time.

400
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:29,154
Look at this. He didn't have
to pay me a dime for this.

401
00:21:29,187 --> 00:21:31,156
You know, all of the
fighters is coming to me

402
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,158
and coming to me because of
my relationship with Billy.

403
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:35,060
- 'Cause we family, Mo.
- I know.

404
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,895
- Daddy!
- Oh, man,

405
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,264
we was talking about you
like a dog, champ.

406
00:21:39,297 --> 00:21:42,333
You should've heard the things Maureen was
saying about you. I said, "The champ?

407
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:43,902
Never!"

408
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,271
- Daddy, come jump with me!
- Okay.

409
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:48,774
You okay?

410
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,909
Yeah. How you doing?

411
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:53,244
- Took me too long to get here.
- You okay?

412
00:21:53,278 --> 00:21:55,180
- Don't look at me like that.
- You been icing?

413
00:21:55,213 --> 00:21:57,548
- Look, Billy, I told Maureen...
- Yeah?

414
00:21:57,582 --> 00:22:00,652
I got HBO to commit
to $30 million.

415
00:22:00,686 --> 00:22:02,087
Ten million per fight.

416
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,955
I just told you,
we're passing on Turay.

417
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,691
Yeah, man.

418
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:07,458
Daddy, come on!

419
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,761
Make sure she doesn't
break her neck.

420
00:22:11,196 --> 00:22:13,932
- He's laughing.
- Oh, boy.

421
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:16,868
- Come on.
- I'm coming.

422
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:24,075
"I just want to thank everybody
from the Children's Club

423
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:26,011
"'cause this place
saved my life.

424
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:28,179
"I grew up in the system.

425
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:31,516
My mother had me when she
was incarcerated."

426
00:22:31,549 --> 00:22:33,819
That... How do you spell
"incarcerated"?

427
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:36,421
- You should say "in jail."
- I-N-C-A-R-C-E-R...

428
00:22:36,454 --> 00:22:38,824
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter, babe.

429
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:41,760
"I got dumped into
foster care the..."

430
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:43,995
I don't want to do this.
I can't do this.

431
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:47,432
Hey, hey, come on.
It's okay, come here.

432
00:22:47,465 --> 00:22:49,534
- I don't want -to talk about this.
- What? What do you mean?

433
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:51,903
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't need to stand up there

434
00:22:51,937 --> 00:22:54,239
in front of a whole group of people
and tell them my fucking life story.

435
00:22:54,272 --> 00:22:57,442
- I don't want to tell them.
- Stop, you're acting crazy. It's okay.

436
00:22:57,475 --> 00:22:59,377
No, they're gonna
look at me like I'm an idiot.

437
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:01,379
No, they love you.
Those kids love you.

438
00:23:01,412 --> 00:23:03,048
And it's for them.
It's a charity, baby.

439
00:23:03,081 --> 00:23:05,583
Don't be nervous.
You're fine. Okay?

440
00:23:05,616 --> 00:23:07,118
Okay?

441
00:23:07,152 --> 00:23:08,987
Put your pants on.

442
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,156
Let's go,
so we can get home, okay?

443
00:23:11,189 --> 00:23:13,191
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

444
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,596
Hey, Leila.

445
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:22,834
I'm gonna tell you something.

446
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:24,269
And it is very important.

447
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,671
Okay? I want you to listen.

448
00:23:26,704 --> 00:23:27,839
- I love you.
- I...

449
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,340
I love you.

450
00:23:29,374 --> 00:23:30,742
So predictable.

451
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,776
Man.

452
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:36,014
The Children's Club of New York

453
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,648
would like to welcome

454
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,284
the Light Heavyweight Champion
of the world,

455
00:23:39,317 --> 00:23:40,986
Billy Hope.

456
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:49,427
Uh, um...

457
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,929
All right, all right,
all right.

458
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:52,530
I'd rather take
a couple punches

459
00:23:52,563 --> 00:23:54,565
than be up, be up here,
but, um...

460
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,678
Well, I wouldn't be
up here tonight,

461
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:11,649
uh, if it wasn't for the...
for... for the Children's Club.

462
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:13,451
They gave me a bed.

463
00:24:13,484 --> 00:24:16,154
They gave me
my first pair of gloves.

464
00:24:16,187 --> 00:24:18,689
Some gloves...
You know, smelly, ratty and...

465
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,192
all tattered.

466
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,094
They were mine.

467
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,963
You know?

468
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:27,365
You got your soul
in those gloves.

469
00:24:27,398 --> 00:24:29,400
Hey, hey, hey,

470
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:31,469
- They gave me a home.
- Hector, chill out.

471
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:34,372
Uh...
I met my boys.

472
00:24:34,405 --> 00:24:36,507
That whole table,

473
00:24:36,541 --> 00:24:38,844
- I would stay away from 'em if I was you.
- Billy!

474
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:41,037
Behave yourself... there are
a lot of rich people here.

475
00:24:42,713 --> 00:24:44,015
Um...

476
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,483
when I was...

477
00:24:45,516 --> 00:24:47,518
when I was...
when I was 12 years old,

478
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,354
there was this little girl.

479
00:24:49,387 --> 00:24:53,258
She was skinny.
She had ratty hair.

480
00:24:53,291 --> 00:24:56,862
She had been through it.
She stuck with me

481
00:24:56,895 --> 00:25:00,932
when I was, uh, um...
was incarcerated.

482
00:25:00,966 --> 00:25:02,333
A couple times.

483
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,839
And I knew she was there.
I wouldn't be here

484
00:25:07,873 --> 00:25:09,707
without my wife Maureen.

485
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,519
Now, you, with your fancy cars

486
00:25:21,552 --> 00:25:23,388
and... or your fancy dresses

487
00:25:23,421 --> 00:25:26,191
and your-your fancy suits

488
00:25:26,224 --> 00:25:29,127
and your beautiful hair,

489
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,761
take some of that money and...

490
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:34,399
and give it, give it...
give us that shit.

491
00:25:34,432 --> 00:25:37,202
All right.

492
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,780
Swagger? No, I got pizzazz.
That's a level above swagger.

493
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:51,682
That's that new shit.

494
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:53,618
Come on, everybody tired
of that old shit, man.

495
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:56,021
Miguel, Miguel. Bitch boy.
Here he comes.

496
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,722
Speaking of old shit.

497
00:25:57,755 --> 00:25:59,090
Watch this.

498
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:00,591
Hey, Billy,
why you leaving so soon?

499
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,928
Come on, baby, let's go.

500
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:05,230
I hope you're not taking everything
personal. I'm just trying to sell a fight.

501
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,665
- Get the fuck off me, man.
- Don't give him any press.

502
00:26:07,698 --> 00:26:09,834
What, I got to fuck your
bitch to talk to you?

503
00:26:09,867 --> 00:26:12,770
Billy, let that go. Come on, keep walking.
Come on. Let's go.

504
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:15,373
How about this? I'll take your
bitch, then I'll take your belt.

505
00:26:15,406 --> 00:26:17,608
Just let it go.
Baby...

506
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,644
- How about I take your belt...
- Let's go home.

507
00:26:19,677 --> 00:26:21,812
- ...then I take your bitch?
- Let it go. Baby.

508
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,181
There he is. There he is.

509
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:24,515
Let's go home.
Walk away.

510
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,918
Stop it. Stop. Billy.

511
00:26:26,952 --> 00:26:29,554
- Billy...
- I'll take your belt, bitch.

512
00:26:29,587 --> 00:26:31,722
Billy!

513
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,524
- Stop it! Stop!
- Get out of the way, Mo!

514
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:40,031
Billy! Billy!

515
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,371
Bitch-ass nigga!

516
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,242
Billy, stop!

517
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:53,044
Stop it!

518
00:26:54,579 --> 00:26:56,581
Fuckin' little bitch!

519
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,816
Get the fuck off me!

520
00:26:58,849 --> 00:27:01,719
- I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.
- Bitch-ass motherfucker!

521
00:27:01,752 --> 00:27:04,322
It wasn't me, man!
He shot my...

522
00:27:06,357 --> 00:27:08,693
Huh? Huh?

523
00:27:08,726 --> 00:27:09,894
Billy?

524
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:11,929
- Hey, hey. Hey, what's up?
- Billy?

525
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:13,464
What's up, baby?

526
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:15,666
What's wrong? What's wrong?

527
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,468
- What?
- I don't know.

528
00:27:17,502 --> 00:27:19,104
- What happened?
- Something happened.

529
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,439
Hey, I don't know what to do.

530
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,441
- Am I okay?
- Yeah, yeah, you're okay.

531
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:24,942
Fuck. Fuck, baby.

532
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,878
Okay. Okay. What do I do?
Do I lie her down?

533
00:27:27,912 --> 00:27:29,914
Do I lie her down?
I don't know what to do.

534
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:31,349
- Go get some help!
- Okay.

535
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:33,551
Hey, call 911, man! Come on!

536
00:27:33,584 --> 00:27:35,753
Hey, hey, hey, hey...
It's okay, it's okay.

537
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,888
- Hey, Jon Jon!
- No, baby, I don't want to lay down.

538
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:39,890
- No, no, no, stay up...
- I don't want to lay down.

539
00:27:39,924 --> 00:27:42,260
Hector did that shit!
It wasn't me! Get off me!

540
00:27:42,293 --> 00:27:43,894
Hector, what the fuck
are you doing?!

541
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,930
What are you fucking
thinking, man?!

542
00:27:45,963 --> 00:27:47,432
Get a doctor here!

543
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:50,501
Get a fucking ambulance!

544
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,103
Yeah? What's up?
What's up, baby?

545
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,005
- I want to go home.
- We're gonna go home.

546
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:56,274
- I want to go home, okay?
- We're gonna go home.

547
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,842
Baby, I want to go home.
I want to go home.

548
00:27:57,875 --> 00:28:00,311
Okay, okay, okay.
Just stay with me.

549
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,248
Hey, look at me, look at me
in the fucking eyes!

550
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:05,183
Look at me
in the eyes, baby!

551
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:07,618
Baby, look at me in the eye!

552
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:09,854
Look me in the eye,
there we go, yeah, yeah.

553
00:28:09,887 --> 00:28:12,090
It's not that bad.
It's not that bad, baby.

554
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,591
It's not that bad.

555
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:16,227
No, no, no, it's okay.
It's okay. No, no.

556
00:28:16,261 --> 00:28:18,029
- Just... that's a little blood.

557
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,730

00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,070
- No. No, no, no, no.

562
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:31,242
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

563
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:33,944
No, no, no!
Hey, hey! Oh, shit.

564
00:28:33,978 --> 00:28:36,447
No, no, baby, it's just

565
00:28:36,481 --> 00:28:37,815

00:28:43,321 --> 00:28:44,789

570
00:28:44,822 --> 00:28:46,757
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay, okay.

571
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,160
There you go, baby,
there you go.

572
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:50,995
There you go.
Cradled in your arms.

573
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:53,831
Wait, wait, wait.

574
00:28:53,864 --> 00:28:55,300
Hey. Hey.

575
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:57,034
No, baby, baby, baby,
wait, wait.

576
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,271
Wait, no.
Look me in the eye, baby.

577
00:29:00,305 --> 00:29:03,341
Baby, baby, stay, stay, stay.

578
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,476
Baby. Baby, stay, stay, stay.

579
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,445
Baby, no.

580
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,180
No, no, no...

581
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,116
Wait, baby, wait.

582
00:29:16,554 --> 00:29:18,623
Shit...

583
00:29:18,656 --> 00:29:20,791
Is there a doctor here?

584
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:22,026
Doctor?!

585
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:26,397
We need a doctor!
We need a doctor!

586
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:42,147
We're sorry
to hear about your loss.

587
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,249
We're gonna try
to make this

588
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:46,651
as, uh, simple and easy
as possible.

589
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,254
We need an eyewitness
to identify the shooter.

590
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,922
No one's talking or they don't
want to be involved.

591
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:55,059
- Do you remember anything?
- What... what time is it?

592
00:29:55,092 --> 00:29:57,928
It's 6:00 a.m. We know it's
been a long night for you,

593
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,664
but we got to ask
these questions.

594
00:29:59,697 --> 00:30:01,432
The housekeeper's there
with my, um,

595
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,268
with my daughter, so I...
Can I just...?

596
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,769
Uh, I can't find my phone.

597
00:30:04,802 --> 00:30:06,771
We just need another
moment of your time.

598
00:30:06,804 --> 00:30:09,740
Uh, one of your crew, uh,
had a weapon on him.

599
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:11,676
He said he was
your security detail.

600
00:30:11,709 --> 00:30:14,111
Unfortunately, he didn't
have a permit to carry.

601
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,347
My daughter wakes up at 6:00.

602
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,183
Okay.

603
00:30:18,216 --> 00:30:20,351
I tell you what, Mr. Hope.

604
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,387
Uh, if, uh,
you can remember

605
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,555
anything, anything at all,
like we said, sir,

606
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:26,624
don't hesitate
to give us a call.

607
00:30:26,657 --> 00:30:29,093
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr. Hope.

608
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:57,147
Hey, baby.

609
00:31:57,181 --> 00:31:58,716
You hungry or...?

610
00:31:58,749 --> 00:32:00,818
I-I could go down
to the kitchen

611
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:02,353
- and get you something to eat.
- No.

612
00:32:02,387 --> 00:32:04,389
All right.

613
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,591
Okay.

614
00:32:09,727 --> 00:32:11,896
Mommy leaves it on.

615
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:16,301
Okay.

616
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,568
Sorry, baby.

617
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,072
Daddy...

618
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,542
Yeah, baby?

619
00:32:28,212 --> 00:32:30,214
Never mind.

620
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:33,551
Okay. Sleep tight.

621
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,163
Lei.

622
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:21,165
Come on, honey.

623
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,538
It's gonna be all right.

624
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,206
It's gonna be
all right. Here.

625
00:33:55,265 --> 00:33:57,902
- What the fuck are you doing here, man?
- Where you been, Billy?

626
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:00,004
We been trying to get
in touch with you.

627
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:02,373
Please, please, can you just
talk to me for a second?

628
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,576
- Please, let me, let me go with you.
- No.

629
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,012
Just please talk to me
for two seconds, man, please.

630
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:11,315
- What do you wanna talk about?
- Just whatever's going on in your head.

631
00:34:11,348 --> 00:34:14,719
I just... I just hope you're not
trying to do anything stupid

632
00:34:14,752 --> 00:34:16,487
like going after
Miguel or Hector.

633
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:17,655
What do you wanna talk about?

634
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:19,356
You wanna fucking talk now?

635
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,726
Do you wanna fucking
talk to me now, huh?

636
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:25,730
- Talk to me, you fucking pussy.
- Geez, I'm sorry!

637
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:28,699
You were the one who's supposed
to fucking look after her.

638
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,868
You were the one...
you were the one

639
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:33,804
- that was supposed to look after her, huh?
- I'm sorry for Mo.

640
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:36,474
I'm sorry...
and for your little girl.

641
00:34:36,507 --> 00:34:37,875
Kid, no, no, no.

642
00:34:37,908 --> 00:34:39,710
Get the fuck
out of my house.

643
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,078
Get the fuck
out of my house!

644
00:34:41,111 --> 00:34:43,080
Get the fuck out!
Get the fuck out!

645
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,384
Ain't fuckin' nothing
needin' nothing, man.

646
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:49,687
No good fucking piece of shit.

647
00:35:23,153 --> 00:35:24,922
Hector!

648
00:35:24,955 --> 00:35:27,592
Hector ain't here.
Who is it?

649
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,226
Open the door.

650
00:35:29,259 --> 00:35:30,861
Who is it?!

651
00:35:30,895 --> 00:35:32,815
I'm looking for Hector.
I got some money for him.

652
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:36,934
I said move!

653
00:35:36,967 --> 00:35:39,136
You-you can give it to me.

654
00:35:39,169 --> 00:35:41,338
No, I need to g...
I need to give it to him.

655
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:47,144
Uh, hold... hold on.

656
00:35:54,118 --> 00:35:55,920
Hector ain't here.

657
00:35:55,953 --> 00:35:57,888
Where is he?
Is he out with Miguel?

658
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,858
I don't know.
You think he tells me shit?

659
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,528
Yo, you gonna give me
money or not?

660
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:05,530
- You got a hit?
- You his wife?

661
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:07,498
I don't have to be.

662
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,199
Not today.

663
00:36:10,467 --> 00:36:11,936
That ain't money.

664
00:36:11,969 --> 00:36:13,738
Yo, you got a hit?

665
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:15,506
Where the fuck is he?

666
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,542
- Hmm?
- Man...

667
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,211
I got kids, man.

668
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:22,547
Come on, baby.

669
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,081
Come on.

670
00:36:24,114 --> 00:36:26,551
What are you doing?
Are you fucking crazy?

671
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:28,619
Mommy's got you.

672
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,320
I've got kids.

673
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,122
Shit.

674
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,525
Hey, I need a hit, though.

675
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,826
Yo, you got a hit?

676
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,896
Hey. Hey!

677
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:40,330
I'm fucking talking to you!

678
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,299
Where the fuck you going?!

679
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:46,370
Fuck...

680
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,891
They're all gonna keep you

681
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:09,026
in that "Billy the Great"
bubble, you know?

682
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:11,361
Billy! Billy! Billy!

683
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:16,734
Billy "The Great"... Hope!

684
00:37:18,302 --> 00:37:19,970
Fuck!

685
00:37:26,276 --> 00:37:27,812
Hey, listen, Billy...

686
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,881
you've got a lot
of money going out.

687
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,382
You know,
with the mortgage

688
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,652
and your friend Gabe's
legal fees

689
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:36,186
and all your taxes
are due,

690
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,122
including your property taxes.

691
00:37:38,155 --> 00:37:40,124
Uh, it's, uh,
starting to add up.

692
00:37:40,157 --> 00:37:43,260
Um, a lot of these
are overdue.

693
00:37:43,293 --> 00:37:44,662
Months, in fact.

694
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:47,397
So... pay them.

695
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,134
- With what?
- With my fucking money, Simon.

696
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,769
That's why I'm here, Billy.

697
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:53,370
The money,
it's drying up.

698
00:37:53,403 --> 00:37:56,106
Look, you gotta see
what's happening here.

699
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,008
Um, you need to cut back.

700
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,777
I mean, they've already
taken two of the cars.

701
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,247
- What's it about, man?
- It... it's real simple.

702
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,616
What's it about,
you-you taking my money?

703
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,084
What?

704
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:10,087
- You stealing from me, Simon?
- No.

705
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,757
I'm-I'm just here
to help out.

706
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,992
- I can take care of this if you want me to.
- Please.

707
00:38:15,025 --> 00:38:17,227
This is fine.

708
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,929
- You can give me that and...
- Okay.

709
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,197
You can leave this with me.

710
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,699
I'll take care of it.

711
00:38:21,732 --> 00:38:23,567
Okay.

712
00:38:26,503 --> 00:38:28,505
Billy, I just want to say
I'm really sorry.

713
00:38:28,538 --> 00:38:31,541
About everything.

714
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,479
Hey, look, Billy.

715
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:37,147
You need this.

716
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,283
This solves all your problems.

717
00:38:39,316 --> 00:38:41,652
- What is that?
- It's the contract.

718
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:44,521
To fight Turay.
Look, I'm not gonna pretend

719
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:46,456
I... I know the pain
you're going through.

720
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,258
But I do know for you
to get through it,

721
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:49,960
you're gonna have
to get back in that ring.

722
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:51,361
No, Mo doesn't want me
to sign that.

723
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,197
No, Mo didn't want you
to sign it then.

724
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,132
Now she would want you
to actually sign the contract.

725
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:56,500
Why you say that?

726
00:38:56,533 --> 00:38:58,202
Billy, every time
I seen you fight,

727
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:00,137
you climb in there alone.

728
00:39:00,170 --> 00:39:02,773
Every time you bled,
you bled your blood.

729
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:04,608
When you sat down on that stool
and it felt like death

730
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:06,844
and you thought you couldn't
get up, but you got up?

731
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,679
You did that.

732
00:39:08,713 --> 00:39:11,782
You need to get back
to that.

733
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,318
You want Leila to grow up
the way you grew up?

734
00:39:14,351 --> 00:39:17,187
You want her in the streets?

735
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:19,256
It's a three-fight deal, Billy.

736
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:21,258
Got to get back to doing
what we do, man.

737
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:25,029
When you're in the ring, you're gonna
feel different. I'm telling you.

738
00:39:26,596 --> 00:39:29,066
It's not about
contracts, right?

739
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,802
It's about family.

740
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:33,476
I don't know what I'd do
without you, man.

741
00:39:33,503 --> 00:39:35,339
You ain't gotta worry
about that, man.

742
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:53,457
Nobody would've
expected Kalil Turay

743
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:57,661
to have his way throughout
the fight against Billy Hope.

744
00:39:57,694 --> 00:40:00,264
Billy, put them goddamn
hands up now!

745
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:02,599
Hope fighting in the wake

746
00:40:02,632 --> 00:40:04,869
- of his wife's unexpected death.
- Get off that rope!

747
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,570
No aggression...

748
00:40:06,603 --> 00:40:09,974
simply a will to continue
taking punishment...

749
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,175
Get off them goddamn ropes!

750
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,810
...and to allow Turay

751
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:15,045
to pound him with both fists

752
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,480
to the body and the head.

753
00:40:16,513 --> 00:40:18,883
Ending it, now!

754
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:23,153
But it's been a bloodletting
from the first bell onward.

755
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:26,323
Yes!

756
00:40:26,356 --> 00:40:28,692
Hope finally gets in a right hand.

757
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:31,095
Those have been
few and far between.

758
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:33,063
- By and large,
- Control your fighter!

759
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:38,435
It was a beat-down by Kalil
Turay, who appears to have scored

760
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:41,772
an upset victory
over Billy Hope

761
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:44,708
and perhaps has put
the finishing touches

762
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:46,576
on Hope's great career.

763
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:49,313
Focus, you hear me?
Huh? Billy, listen to me, man.

764
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:51,715
I'm not gonna watch this. I'm not
gonna watch this happen to you, man.

765
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:53,417
I'm not gonna watch
this happen to us.

766
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:55,085
Billy, if you don't
show me something here,

767
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,520
I'm gonna call it.
That's it. You hear me?

768
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:58,355
We're done.
Wake up, champ.

769
00:40:58,388 --> 00:41:00,657
Don't call it, man.
No, don't call it.

770
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,426
What the fuck
are we doing here, huh?

771
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:04,061
I gotta end
this shit, Billy.

772
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,830
You hear me?

773
00:41:05,863 --> 00:41:08,098
I'm not gonna watch this shit
happen to you, man, all right?

774
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,666
Remember when we were done,

775
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,535
when we were done,
you used to fight?

776
00:41:11,568 --> 00:41:13,804
Like, get up, get up.
Let's go.

777
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:15,739
Come on, champ.
Let's go.

778
00:41:17,474 --> 00:41:19,443
He keep looking
out the ring for Maureen.

779
00:41:19,476 --> 00:41:21,745
He's losing
his fucking mind, bro.

780
00:41:23,313 --> 00:41:24,815
Seconds out.

781
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,250
This guy is done.

782
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,018
He's not the champ anymore.
Finish him.

783
00:41:28,052 --> 00:41:30,921
Hands up. Fight back.
Focus. Come on.

784
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,722
Corner ready?

785
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,818
Get the damn hands up,
Billy! Now!

786
00:42:10,494 --> 00:42:12,462
Oh, man!

787
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:24,074
Billy Hope has
refused to compete here tonight.

788
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:25,709
...fuck you!

789
00:42:25,742 --> 00:42:28,979
Another giant shot from Turay

790
00:42:29,013 --> 00:42:30,915
and the referee
is gonna stop it.

791
00:42:30,948 --> 00:42:32,849
- It's gonna be the end of that.
- It's over.

792
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,518
No, don't call it.
No, don't call it.

793
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,286
- That's it, it's over.
- No...!

794
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,288
And Hope headbutts the referee!

795
00:42:40,557 --> 00:42:43,827
A horrible moment
as a final postscript

796
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,364
to what has been a horrible
night for Billy Hope,

797
00:42:47,397 --> 00:42:49,399
and a career which produced
so many thrills...

798
00:42:49,433 --> 00:42:52,769
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- ...and so much joyous glory,

799
00:42:52,802 --> 00:42:57,975
appears to have ended
ignominiously here tonight.

800
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,496
Eli?

801
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:25,702
Eli?

802
00:43:27,837 --> 00:43:29,506
Is Jordan here?

803
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,488
Is anybody still here?

804
00:43:47,857 --> 00:43:50,294
You headbutt a referee, man.

805
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,162
What the fuck kind of shit
was that, man?

806
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:55,932
Broke his nose. Shattered his
motherfucking cheekbone.

807
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,867
What got into you, man?

808
00:43:57,901 --> 00:44:00,971
We did the biggest deal
that we ever did, Billy,

809
00:44:01,005 --> 00:44:03,007
and you fucked it off, man.

810
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,809
It'll be a year before your
suspension is up for review,

811
00:44:05,842 --> 00:44:08,512
which means zero income. The fine
for the assault on the referee

812
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:10,714
will be in the six figures.
He's suing you

813
00:44:10,747 --> 00:44:12,882
for lost wages
and emotional trauma.

814
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:15,285
They're freezing all your
bank accounts immediately,

815
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,388
and to top that off the networks are
suing us for breach of contract, man.

816
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,424
Listen...

817
00:44:20,457 --> 00:44:23,360
you're gonna have to sell the
house to cover the debt.

818
00:44:23,393 --> 00:44:26,997
No, I don't wanna sell the house, man.
I'm not selling the house.

819
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:29,666
- That's Leila's home.
- You don't have a choice, Billy.

820
00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:32,569
If you don't, it's gonna
get repossessed anyway.

821
00:44:32,602 --> 00:44:34,538
- This is some serious shit.
- No, no, no.

822
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,042
I'll just train with Eli and then
we'll get ready for the next fight.

823
00:44:38,075 --> 00:44:40,610
I'm not even sure trainers
will take you on right now.

824
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,646
What? I don't need another trainer.
I can just use...

825
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:44,981
Eli's working
with another fighter.

826
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,717
- Who? Who is he? Who is he?
- Miguel Escobar.

827
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:51,088
- Are you working with him, too?
- Yeah.

828
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:53,623
Billy, you know if
it makes money, it makes sense.

829
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:57,761
- Oh, you...
- It's just business, Billy.

830
00:44:57,794 --> 00:45:01,431
I know you miss Maureen.
I miss Maureen, too, man.

831
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,468
Shit, if she was here, she'd
be disgusted with you, man.

832
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,137
We need you to pull yourself together.
You need help, Billy.

833
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:09,339
Don't talk about
my wife that way.

834
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:15,512
I fucking quit.
Fuck you.

835
00:45:15,545 --> 00:45:17,181
Can't do this anymore, Billy.

836
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:18,448
Fuck outta my way.

837
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:22,386
Scatter like roaches.

838
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,854
Y'all follow him, make sure he don't
break no shit on the way out.

839
00:45:31,928 --> 00:45:33,297
Just a bunch of roaches.

840
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,832
Now I fuckin' wrote you off.

841
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,682
Baby, let's go home.
Let's go home.

842
00:46:25,715 --> 00:46:29,353
Let it go.
Baby, baby, stop it... stop...

843
00:47:05,255 --> 00:47:07,224
I'm sorry.

844
00:47:10,927 --> 00:47:13,597
I'm sorry.

845
00:47:20,103 --> 00:47:22,105
Dad?

846
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:28,245
Dad?

847
00:47:28,278 --> 00:47:30,680
Dad! Daddy!

848
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,516
Daddy, what happened?

849
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:34,851
Daddy! Daddy!

850
00:47:34,884 --> 00:47:38,021
Somebody help me!
Somebody!

851
00:47:38,054 --> 00:47:39,923
Mr. Hope,
what did you take, sir?

852
00:47:39,956 --> 00:47:43,793
What did you take, Mr. Hope?
What'd you take?

853
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:46,796
What kind of medicine,
Mr. Hope? What did you take?

854
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:49,266
Mr. Hope?
What did you take, sir?

855
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:51,435
Leila...
Where's my baby?

856
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:55,038
Your daughter's fine. She's the one who
called 911. You were in an accident.

857
00:47:55,071 --> 00:47:56,873
- There's people looking after her.
- Leila?

858
00:47:56,906 --> 00:47:59,743
No, no, no. No, no.
She needs me.

859
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,711
We found you with
a loaded weapon, Mr. Hope,

860
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:03,780
under the influence,
with a minor present.

861
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:06,149
Where's my baby? Leila?

862
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:09,686
Where's Leila?
I gotta get outta here.

863
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:12,021
Your daughter's with Child Services.
They're looking after her right now.

864
00:48:12,055 --> 00:48:13,623
- No, no, no, no...
- Everything's okay.

865
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:15,359
No, no, no. No!

866
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,261
- They're looking after her.
- We just lost the IV.

867
00:48:17,294 --> 00:48:19,396
- Get him down. Get his legs.
- No, no, no, no!

868
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:21,164
- No!
- You got him?

869
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,832
Lay back for me, Mr. Hope.
You're gonna be just fine.

870
00:48:22,866 --> 00:48:24,801
- No!
- Come on, just breathe.

871
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:29,873
- Lay back. Everything's all right.
- Breathe.

872
00:48:29,906 --> 00:48:31,641
Just... just chill out
for a second.

873
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:33,543
You're gonna be okay,
Mr. Hope.

874
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:35,078
Just take a deep breath for me.

875
00:48:35,111 --> 00:48:36,880
Gonna be fine, all right?

876
00:48:38,282 --> 00:48:39,916
Gonna be fine.

877
00:48:39,949 --> 00:48:42,151
You're gonna be fine, Mr. Hope.

878
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:43,553
Just relax.

879
00:48:47,056 --> 00:48:48,992
Maureen... no...

880
00:48:49,025 --> 00:48:51,194
no... I was...

881
00:48:59,669 --> 00:49:00,970
Maureen...

882
00:49:12,682 --> 00:49:15,585
Okay, he wants his copies.
I'll provide that.

883
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,587
I promise.
By day's end.

884
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,523
- If it's okay with you.
- All right.

885
00:49:19,556 --> 00:49:22,091
What about
the, uh... this evidence?

886
00:49:22,125 --> 00:49:23,660
Daddy.

887
00:49:23,693 --> 00:49:26,830
- Baby!
- Sit down, Mr. Hope.

888
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,266
I just want to hug my dad.

889
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,268
Mr. Korman,
get your client, please.

890
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:33,837
Sit down.
Sit down, Billy.

891
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:36,306
Thank you.
We're ready to begin.

892
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,675
The matter this morning
is provisional custody

893
00:49:38,708 --> 00:49:40,944
of Leila Rae Hope, a minor...

894
00:49:40,977 --> 00:49:43,713
- When can I get her out?
- Don't interrupt, Mr. Hope.

895
00:49:43,747 --> 00:49:46,816
The child has no other
family, is that right?

896
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:49,953
Uh, no, Your Honor.
Uh, both my client

897
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,988
and his wife came up
through the system.

898
00:49:52,021 --> 00:49:54,190
I see.
So that's why

899
00:49:54,223 --> 00:49:56,760
these circumstances are a little
bit more painful for you.

900
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:59,563
I want my daughter back.
I'm her father.

901
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,598
Unfortunately,
that's not enough.

902
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:05,068
This court is aware of
the tragedy

903
00:50:05,101 --> 00:50:07,537
your family
has suffered, Mr. Hope.

904
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,272
Nonetheless,
you have chosen

905
00:50:09,305 --> 00:50:12,141
to demonstrate alarming
and dangerous behaviors,

906
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,644
while having
custody of your daughter.

907
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:19,115
Loaded weapons,
alcohol, violence...

908
00:50:19,148 --> 00:50:22,386
Mr. Hope will follow a case plan
that the court has designed.

909
00:50:22,419 --> 00:50:25,254
Said plan will include
individual counseling,

910
00:50:25,288 --> 00:50:28,425
as well as sobriety
and anger management classes.

911
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:33,329
And I order said child remanded into
the care of the Family Services,

912
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,765
until which time
the father can demonstrate

913
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:38,902
the abilities to perform duties
of a responsible parent.

914
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:41,104
- What?
- Parties back in 30 days

915
00:50:41,137 --> 00:50:42,906
- 30 days?!
- ...for a progress hearing.

916
00:50:42,939 --> 00:50:44,808
What the fuck does that mean?
30 days?

917
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:47,343
- Watch your language.
- 30 days is bullshit, man.

918
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,145
- That's bullshit!
- I will find you in contempt.

919
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:50,980
Please, please,
I don't want to...

920
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,649
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.
- My last warning.

921
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,451
I don't want to.
Please, Daddy!

922
00:50:54,484 --> 00:50:56,620
- Billy! Come on! Billy!
- Take the child out, please.

923
00:50:56,653 --> 00:50:58,021
Please, I want
to stay with you!

924
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:00,824
Let me just give
my daughter a hug!

925
00:51:00,857 --> 00:51:02,426
No, no, no...

926
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,528
Daddy! Please!

927
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,296
- He wants to see his daughter!
- Please, Dad...

928
00:51:07,330 --> 00:51:09,733
- Daddy!
- That's not necessary.

929
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,101
No! I want to live with you!

930
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:13,570
Please!

931
00:51:13,603 --> 00:51:15,672
- Get down there.
- Daddy! Daddy!

932
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,742
Mr. Hope, that's enough.
I will hold you in contempt.

933
00:51:45,301 --> 00:51:48,772
Everything goes to auction.

934
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,179
Hey, Evan, help me out
with this, will you?

935
00:51:56,212 --> 00:51:59,883
That'll go inside
the truck, towards the back.

936
00:52:03,286 --> 00:52:06,255
- Auction's tomorrow.
- No, it's all going to auction.

937
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:07,390
Sorry, champ.

938
00:53:04,313 --> 00:53:07,183
Yeah, it's just a house, yeah?

939
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:12,856
Hey, yo, thanks for, uh...
thanks for taking me.

940
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,558
No, Billy.

941
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,860
You know, I-I can't
really pay you right now.

942
00:53:16,893 --> 00:53:20,564
Well, fuck you.

943
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:21,931
No, I don't want
to get paid.

944
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,670
No, I was never here
for money, you know that.

945
00:53:26,703 --> 00:53:28,605
Never.

946
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:30,139
Hey, yo.

947
00:53:30,173 --> 00:53:31,808
Hmm?

948
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:36,512
I'm sorry, Billy.

949
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,715
Hey, hey, hey.

950
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,124
- This the place?
- Yeah.

951
00:53:48,157 --> 00:53:50,259
You, uh, you want me
to come with you?

952
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,061
No, man, no, no.

953
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:54,163
I got to do this alone.

954
00:53:57,901 --> 00:54:00,804
- It's yours.
- No, man, I'm not taking that shit.

955
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,606
- I'm re-gifting it.
- I'm not taking that shit.

956
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:03,907
I don't want it.

957
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,676
So, you stay safe,

958
00:54:06,710 --> 00:54:08,878
- all right?
- Yeah, you, too.

959
00:54:15,384 --> 00:54:16,886
Call me if you
need anything.

960
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,387
Yeah, all right, I will.

961
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:19,823
Yeah.

962
00:54:27,063 --> 00:54:29,032
- I'll be around!
- Hey, yo, Jon Jon,

963
00:54:29,065 --> 00:54:30,934
go say hi to Mikey
and Gabe, all right?

964
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:32,501
- You got it.
- Hey.

965
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,252
- That's Billy Hope.
- For real?

966
00:55:23,286 --> 00:55:24,754
I didn't know
Billy Hope...

967
00:55:27,123 --> 00:55:30,393
Boo! That's it. Good work.

968
00:55:30,426 --> 00:55:32,762
Hey, Hoppy, I want you
on the ropes.

969
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,698
I already did that shit.

970
00:55:34,731 --> 00:55:37,200
What'd you say?

971
00:55:38,735 --> 00:55:40,203
Give me 50.

972
00:55:40,236 --> 00:55:42,271
- Hey, T?
- Yes?

973
00:55:42,305 --> 00:55:44,173
You work with him
on one of those mitts?

974
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,110
Yo, T.

975
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:49,045
That's Billy Hope
over there.

976
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,515
Ramone, let's go!

977
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,234
You Tick Wills?

978
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,369
So, what brings Billy Hope...

979
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:14,838
into my gym?

980
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,341
I'm looking for a...
you know, a place to train.

981
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:21,077
And, you know,

982
00:56:21,110 --> 00:56:23,546
I don't know,
may-maybe a...

983
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:25,614
trainer?

984
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,651
I don't train
pro fighters anymore.

985
00:56:28,684 --> 00:56:31,988
Well, currently,
I am not a pro fighter.

986
00:56:32,021 --> 00:56:33,723
Do you think
I don't know that?

987
00:56:36,692 --> 00:56:41,097
Does it say in there that they
took my kid away from me?

988
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:45,201
- Yeah, it does.
- It's been... it's been

989
00:56:45,234 --> 00:56:48,404
kind of...
like a whole mess.

990
00:56:48,437 --> 00:56:51,240
I was, I-I-I,
I-I remember that Ni...

991
00:56:51,274 --> 00:56:54,177
that Night Train fight, you know
what I mean, and I remember...

992
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:57,180
I remember that-that,
you know...

993
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,816
that was one hell of a fight,
you know?

994
00:56:59,849 --> 00:57:01,851
You're one hell of a coach,
you know, and, uh...

995
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,487
man, he won that fight.

996
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,222
Excuse me,
but if I remember correctly...

997
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:09,058
And I do remember...
You won the fight.

998
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,327
You got the decision.
Don't you remember?

999
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,662
Yeah, I won that fight. I think
Jordan Mains paid it off.

1000
00:57:13,696 --> 00:57:15,832
- Anyway, y...
- Jordan Mains paid them off?

1001
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:19,202
Yeah, look, I don't know, man.
It's the fight game, you know?

1002
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:20,703
How you gonna come in here
and say something like that?

1003
00:57:20,736 --> 00:57:23,539
I'm just saying
that's why I'm here.

1004
00:57:23,572 --> 00:57:26,175
Night Train was the only
fighter that beat me.

1005
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:29,312
I know you were
his trainer, and...

1006
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:32,381
I don't know how you...
how you train, but...

1007
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:34,683
- So that's why I'm here.
- See, the thing is,

1008
00:57:34,717 --> 00:57:37,253
you couldn't handle
the rules here, man.

1009
00:57:37,286 --> 00:57:39,155
I can handle the rules, man,
I'll handle the rules.

1010
00:57:39,188 --> 00:57:41,457
Believe me, I grew up in the system.
I can handle the rules.

1011
00:57:41,490 --> 00:57:44,727
You saw that funny little kid had
to do 50 push-ups for swearing?

1012
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,963
- Yeah.
- That's one of the rules here.

1013
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,731
No drinking, no drugs,

1014
00:57:48,764 --> 00:57:51,167
no playing around,
no being late, none of that.

1015
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,369
No problems, you know what I'm saying?
I don't need that here.

1016
00:57:53,402 --> 00:57:55,238
It's my job
to protect these kids.

1017
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,373
I'm here to train them
so they can grow up

1018
00:57:57,406 --> 00:57:59,408
to be men.
You ready to work?

1019
00:57:59,442 --> 00:58:01,477
- Yeah, yeah. I'm ready to work.
- 'Cause the thing is,

1020
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,246
you're not gonna be able
to throw a punch,

1021
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:05,281
in or out of the ring,
until I tell you to.

1022
00:58:05,314 --> 00:58:07,016
- Yeah, fuck it, I'm in.
- No swearing.

1023
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:08,384
Did I tell you no swearing?

1024
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:09,986
Did I tell you no swearing?

1025
00:58:10,019 --> 00:58:11,187
No, no, no, I...
yeah, yeah, yeah.

1026
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,721
Yeah, no swearing.

1027
00:58:12,755 --> 00:58:15,791
Boxing is not about this;
boxing's about this.

1028
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,793
Boxing is like a chess game.

1029
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,662
Yeah, all right, fuck,
let's... uh, yes.

1030
00:58:19,695 --> 00:58:22,098
Uh, not, uh,
fu... not fuck. Yes.

1031
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:23,833
Whoa. Are you on drugs?

1032
00:58:25,869 --> 00:58:27,203
Are you intoxicated?

1033
00:58:27,236 --> 00:58:28,771
I'm good, man.
I'm-I'm straight.

1034
00:58:33,742 --> 00:58:35,078
Did you see this?

1035
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:37,613
All right.

1036
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:40,683
All right.

1037
00:58:40,716 --> 00:58:44,220
I also need a job.
Yeah, I need to...

1038
00:58:44,253 --> 00:58:47,456
I need to prove to the court
that I can hold a job.

1039
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:55,364
I got a...

1040
00:58:55,398 --> 00:58:57,833
a night man
who just had a stroke,

1041
00:58:57,867 --> 00:59:01,137
and he was cleaning
this whole place up.

1042
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,906
You could do that,
you can get your fees,

1043
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:04,740
and you can
make yourself a little check.

1044
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:07,443
Wow, you want me to clean
your fuckin' toilets?

1045
00:59:07,476 --> 00:59:09,678
- Just to clean the place.
- I'm supposed to clean up

1046
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:12,581
after these punks here?
Is that what you think of me?

1047
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:14,583
- But you need a job.
- Yo, come on, man,

1048
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:17,954
I'm not gonna clean your
fuckin' toilets. Come on.

1049
00:59:17,987 --> 00:59:20,156
Do you need a job or not?

1050
00:59:20,189 --> 00:59:22,558
Nah, fuck this. Nah.

1051
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:36,139
And rent...
First day of the month.

1052
00:59:36,172 --> 00:59:37,806
Where's the light?

1053
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:40,143
- First day, one of the month.
- Okay.

1054
00:59:40,176 --> 00:59:41,510
Okay, you pay rent? Huh?

1055
00:59:41,544 --> 00:59:43,412
- Yeah.
- Down this way.

1056
00:59:48,817 --> 00:59:51,654
Three keys...
This work, the other...

1057
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,375
I never thought I'd see

1058
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:14,877
one of these places
again, Billy.

1059
01:00:16,312 --> 01:00:18,614
All right, man.

1060
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:20,716
Hey, tell Leila
hi for me.

1061
01:00:20,749 --> 01:00:22,885
Can I help you?

1062
01:00:22,918 --> 01:00:24,753
My name is, uh, Billy Hope.

1063
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,523
Um, Leila... I'm here to,
I'm here to see my daughter.

1064
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:32,361
All right,
so the court is requiring

1065
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:34,463
drug screening twice a week?

1066
01:00:34,497 --> 01:00:37,866
And hair samples
once a month, right?

1067
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,803
If you fail or miss one,
then I have to report it.

1068
01:00:40,836 --> 01:00:42,571
When can I see Leila?

1069
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:45,574
Once we go
through this form.

1070
01:00:46,742 --> 01:00:48,644
What is your current address?

1071
01:00:48,677 --> 01:00:51,347
I'm staying at the Tassler
right now.

1072
01:00:51,380 --> 01:00:52,948
I'm staying there
till I can find,

1073
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,351
you know, a better...
better place to stay.

1074
01:00:55,384 --> 01:00:57,720
- You know, find a place of my own.
- Mm-hmm.

1075
01:00:57,753 --> 01:00:59,588
And have you
secured employment yet?

1076
01:00:59,622 --> 01:01:01,624
- Yeah.
- Where?

1077
01:01:01,657 --> 01:01:04,493
- A gy... at the gym.
- The gym?

1078
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:08,464
Wills Gym on 156th Street.

1079
01:01:08,497 --> 01:01:10,099
And who gave you
that employment?

1080
01:01:10,133 --> 01:01:12,368
I got it myself.

1081
01:01:12,401 --> 01:01:13,969
But who gave you the job?

1082
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:17,240
- The owner of the gym.
- And his name is?

1083
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:20,943
Tick Wills.

1084
01:01:20,976 --> 01:01:22,711
Does Tick Wills have a number
I could call?

1085
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,713
I don't know.
I don't have a phone.

1086
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,049
I don't know.

1087
01:01:26,082 --> 01:01:28,551
How much you get paid?

1088
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,454
We haven't discussed that
just yet.

1089
01:01:31,487 --> 01:01:33,789
So you haven't started
the job yet?

1090
01:01:33,822 --> 01:01:36,459
- Hmm?
- You haven't started the job yet?

1091
01:01:36,492 --> 01:01:38,461
No, you just...
you-you just asked

1092
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:40,463
- if I secured... it...
- Yeah.

1093
01:01:40,496 --> 01:01:42,265
And I tol...
I secured it.

1094
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,268
Have you taken drugs
or anything with alcohol today?

1095
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:47,603
No. I haven't slept
very well, though. No.

1096
01:01:47,636 --> 01:01:49,072
You on any form of medication?

1097
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,606
I took some Advil.

1098
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:52,908
You're gonna
write that down?

1099
01:01:52,941 --> 01:01:55,644
- Mm-hmm.
- "He took some Advil.

1100
01:01:55,678 --> 01:01:57,746
He can't see his kid."

1101
01:01:57,780 --> 01:01:59,648
These are the questions
on the form.

1102
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,517
That's just the protocol
that we have to go through.

1103
01:02:01,550 --> 01:02:03,852
- Go after the test.
- But I'm asking you,

1104
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,754
because we're
about to see Leila,

1105
01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:07,823
so I want to know
what kind of shape you're in.

1106
01:02:10,626 --> 01:02:13,028
I'm a fuckin' mess.

1107
01:02:15,164 --> 01:02:17,433
When can I see my daughter?

1108
01:02:17,466 --> 01:02:20,669
And you think I should let you see your
daughter when you're a fuckin' mess?

1109
01:02:23,772 --> 01:02:27,343
If I see my daughter, I'll
feel a lot better, all right?

1110
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:29,312
Will she feel a lot better?

1111
01:02:29,345 --> 01:02:31,080
- Yes.
- Do you feel

1112
01:02:31,114 --> 01:02:33,449
in a fit state
to see your daughter today?

1113
01:02:33,482 --> 01:02:35,518
You want to help me?
Is that what you want to do?

1114
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,753
- You want to help me?
- I want to help Leila.

1115
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:41,390
That's my first priority.

1116
01:02:45,194 --> 01:02:46,395
Hey.

1117
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,065
Hey, baby.

1118
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:55,904
Hey...

1119
01:02:59,041 --> 01:03:00,809
You okay?

1120
01:03:02,678 --> 01:03:04,513
Can you give us a second?

1121
01:03:04,547 --> 01:03:07,015
Leila, would you be
comfortable with that?

1122
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:09,952
- If I stand right over there?
- Sure.

1123
01:03:09,985 --> 01:03:11,920
Okay.

1124
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,489
All right.

1125
01:03:13,522 --> 01:03:15,558
I'm just over here.

1126
01:03:19,395 --> 01:03:20,696
What's wrong, baby?

1127
01:03:20,729 --> 01:03:22,431
Did somebody touch you?

1128
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:23,832
- Somebody hurt you?
- No...

1129
01:03:23,866 --> 01:03:25,734
- They put a hand on you?
- No.

1130
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,271
They put a hand on you, baby?
You can tell me.

1131
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,473
- Mm-mm.
- Leila...

1132
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:32,708
You talk to me?

1133
01:03:32,741 --> 01:03:35,110
There's nothing to say.

1134
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:36,912
You fucked up.

1135
01:03:36,945 --> 01:03:39,014
Don't use that
language with me.

1136
01:03:39,047 --> 01:03:41,884
Or what? You gonna
punish me or something?

1137
01:03:41,917 --> 01:03:44,253
Look, I know that you're
mad at me right now...

1138
01:03:44,287 --> 01:03:46,021
You don't know anything!

1139
01:03:46,054 --> 01:03:48,524
- Hey, hey. Hey, wait, wait...
- Can I go outside now?

1140
01:03:48,557 --> 01:03:49,825
Yes, you can.

1141
01:03:49,858 --> 01:03:51,694
- Yes, you can.
- Leila...

1142
01:03:51,727 --> 01:03:53,629
- just talk to me.
- Come on, Talia, let's go.

1143
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:55,598
Come on, we got a
couple minutes, baby.

1144
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,266
Is that your dad?

1145
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,134
I don't know anymore.

1146
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:04,373
Leila, will you come...
Leila, will you come back?

1147
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:17,152
What you doing here?

1148
01:04:18,554 --> 01:04:21,056
Could I buy you a beer?

1149
01:04:23,292 --> 01:04:25,127
I don't drink.

1150
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:31,934
I'll take that job.

1151
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,202
Step forward...
Step forward...

1152
01:05:07,236 --> 01:05:10,306
Step back.
Step back.

1153
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,040
Relax, relax, relax, relax.

1154
01:05:12,074 --> 01:05:13,576
One, two.

1155
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,077
To the right.

1156
01:05:16,144 --> 01:05:17,580
To the left.

1157
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:19,682
Don't cross your hands.

1158
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,785
Step forward...
Step back.

1159
01:05:22,818 --> 01:05:26,622
- Step back.
- Can I get that for you, champ?

1160
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:37,700
What's your name?

1161
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:40,803
- Hoppy.
- What's that from?

1162
01:05:40,836 --> 01:05:43,739
My mom liked bunnies, so...

1163
01:05:43,772 --> 01:05:46,609
...she named me Hoppy.

1164
01:05:46,642 --> 01:05:48,777
Man, to think that...

1165
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,779
Billy "The Great"
would walk in here.

1166
01:05:50,813 --> 01:05:53,349
Just trying to get
some work here, you know?

1167
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,984
Oh, yeah, sure thing.

1168
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,721
- No more.
- Can I get a picture with you later?

1169
01:05:58,754 --> 01:06:01,023
Yeah, if you finish
tying my... tying my shit...

1170
01:06:01,056 --> 01:06:05,461
Oh. I can't say "shit."

1171
01:06:05,494 --> 01:06:08,797
Step forward. You're being
too hard on yourself, son.

1172
01:06:08,831 --> 01:06:10,666
You can't learn everything
in one day.

1173
01:06:10,699 --> 01:06:12,200
- Hear me?
- Yes, sir.

1174
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:16,305
All right?

1175
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:17,906
All right?

1176
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,079
Mr. Hope?

1177
01:06:24,112 --> 01:06:26,749
Can I speak to you
for a moment, please?

1178
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,250
What's up?

1179
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:31,987
Yo, is Leila all right?

1180
01:06:34,557 --> 01:06:36,592
Where's Leila?

1181
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:41,597
Uh, she doesn't want
to see you today.

1182
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:43,699
What do you mean?

1183
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:46,635
She doesn't want
to see you today.

1184
01:06:46,669 --> 01:06:49,905
I'm sorry.

1185
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:52,908
But I think we're gonna have
to give her some space

1186
01:06:52,941 --> 01:06:54,777
and respect her wishes.

1187
01:06:57,480 --> 01:07:00,215
She said...
she-she said that?

1188
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:01,984
Yes, she did.

1189
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,559
...last night's
fight, Magic Escobar

1190
01:07:10,593 --> 01:07:12,260
defeated Kalil Turay

1191
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,129
by knockout in the fourth round.

1192
01:07:14,162 --> 01:07:17,132
An incredible knockout,
and Turay did not recover.

1193
01:07:17,165 --> 01:07:20,302
Miguel is now the new WBC
Light Heavyweight Champion

1194
01:07:20,335 --> 01:07:23,005
of the World,
a title once held by...

1195
01:07:28,243 --> 01:07:30,112
Come on, marry me?

1196
01:07:30,145 --> 01:07:32,515
Okay, how about...
let me check my schedule.

1197
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:34,149
I'll get back to you.

1198
01:07:34,182 --> 01:07:36,819
Hold my hand?

1199
01:07:36,852 --> 01:07:39,788
- I'll be waiting for you.
- Uh-huh.

1200
01:07:39,822 --> 01:07:41,624
What's up, man?

1201
01:07:41,657 --> 01:07:44,292
Thought you said
you didn't drink.

1202
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:46,629
What, you think a man
can't pick up a new habit?

1203
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:48,631
What are you doing here, man?

1204
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:50,566
Seriously, this is my spot.

1205
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:52,000
Can I get a wa... a water?

1206
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,637
Drinking's a solitary sport.

1207
01:07:54,670 --> 01:07:56,605
It's a solitary one.

1208
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,774
I'm just trying to...

1209
01:07:58,807 --> 01:08:00,476
I'm just trying
to connect here, man.

1210
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:03,779
- I just...
- I just didn't want to go home.

1211
01:08:03,812 --> 01:08:05,848
300 square feet of...

1212
01:08:05,881 --> 01:08:08,016
nothing, you know?

1213
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:12,955
You got plans?

1214
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:15,891
Uh, um, what you mean by that?

1215
01:08:15,924 --> 01:08:19,528
You know what you're gonna do with all this
training that you think you so desperately need?

1216
01:08:19,562 --> 01:08:21,196
What you gonna do with it?

1217
01:08:21,229 --> 01:08:23,198
I'm gonna fight, and then
I'm gonna get my kid back.

1218
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:25,601
Then you're gonna end up
right back here?

1219
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:28,070
- What are you saying?
- What do you think got you here?

1220
01:08:29,938 --> 01:08:32,174
Um, fuck...
some scumbag killed my wife.

1221
01:08:32,207 --> 01:08:35,310
What do you think you did...
to be sitting here?

1222
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,381
Why...

1223
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:41,617
- did your wife get killed?
- Look, man,

1224
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,151
all due respect, you know,

1225
01:08:43,185 --> 01:08:44,953
I haven't really gotten
much sleep, man.

1226
01:08:44,987 --> 01:08:46,455
- What are you try to ask me...
- What happened?

1227
01:08:46,489 --> 01:08:48,290
I don't fucking...
I just told you...

1228
01:08:48,323 --> 01:08:49,658
What did you do?!

1229
01:08:49,692 --> 01:08:50,926
Why you keep asking me
that question?

1230
01:08:50,959 --> 01:08:52,495
What happened?

1231
01:08:52,528 --> 01:08:55,230
- What happened?
- I just told you what happened.

1232
01:08:55,263 --> 01:08:58,601
- Why?
- I can't tell you why. What do you mean, why?

1233
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,503
Never mind.

1234
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:03,171
You can't even hear
the question.

1235
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,508
Why are you laughing?
What, is this funny to you?

1236
01:09:05,541 --> 01:09:07,342
Is that fucking funny to you?

1237
01:09:07,375 --> 01:09:08,911
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1238
01:09:08,944 --> 01:09:10,445
Piece of shit.
Fuck you.

1239
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,147
You see that?
That's what this...

1240
01:09:12,180 --> 01:09:13,582
that's why you here.

1241
01:09:13,616 --> 01:09:15,150
That's why you here.

1242
01:09:15,183 --> 01:09:18,086
- It's all good, Tick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1243
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:25,561
Yo, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1244
01:09:25,594 --> 01:09:27,763
- Hey, don't bring that shit back in here.
- I'm sorry.

1245
01:09:27,796 --> 01:09:30,633
That's okay. We don't need...

1246
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,467
Nobody wants your money.

1247
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,974
What do you want, man?

1248
01:09:39,007 --> 01:09:40,909
I never really had any plans,
all right?

1249
01:09:40,943 --> 01:09:42,945
My wife always made
the plans for me.

1250
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:45,681
And my daughter

1251
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:49,351
- Right.
- ...doesn't even want to see me right now.

1252
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:57,325
And I feel like
I broke her heart.

1253
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:07,502
Little kid, man,
she's a little girl.

1254
01:10:07,536 --> 01:10:10,172
She's trying to take care
of herself.

1255
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,876
She lost her mother, too.

1256
01:10:17,913 --> 01:10:19,582
Even if she hates you,

1257
01:10:19,615 --> 01:10:21,449
you got to let her hate you,

1258
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:24,219
so she can feel better
about it, she can get better.

1259
01:10:24,252 --> 01:10:26,088
This ain't
about how you feel.

1260
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:27,489
I mean,

1261
01:10:27,522 --> 01:10:31,994
you got to let her go
through her thing

1262
01:10:32,027 --> 01:10:35,898
and not think that thing
is your thing.

1263
01:10:38,967 --> 01:10:41,036
Then you can deal

1264
01:10:41,069 --> 01:10:45,507
with life, like that stuff.

1265
01:10:45,540 --> 01:10:47,910
Life...

1266
01:10:47,943 --> 01:10:50,112
boxing, whatever you want.

1267
01:11:26,682 --> 01:11:27,950
Hey, come on. Come here, Hoppy.

1268
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:29,785
Let's go.

1269
01:11:29,818 --> 01:11:31,419
Ready? Jab.

1270
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,955
Jab.

1271
01:11:32,988 --> 01:11:34,623
Slow it down. Jab.

1272
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:35,891
Yeah, make it accurate.

1273
01:11:36,992 --> 01:11:38,093
No pows, power, pop...

1274
01:11:38,126 --> 01:11:39,995
No power, no power yet.

1275
01:11:42,965 --> 01:11:44,266
What, what, what, what?

1276
01:11:44,299 --> 01:11:46,702
What, what, what,
what, what? Jab.

1277
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:48,737
There you go. That's... Bam!

1278
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:58,480
Hey.

1279
01:11:58,513 --> 01:12:00,282
Um... She...

1280
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:01,984
I don't wanna know...
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1281
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:03,919
I know. Um...

1282
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,187
She used to sleep with this.

1283
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,255
Would you give that to her?

1284
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:08,957
- Make sure she gets that?
- Yeah.

1285
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,059
I will.

1286
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:12,861
Tell her I love her.

1287
01:12:27,876 --> 01:12:29,211
We start tomorrow.

1288
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:31,113
What, like training?

1289
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:33,648
No, baking cookies.

1290
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:35,984
I'm going to the bar.

1291
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,086
I do not want to see you there.

1292
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:40,055
Yeah, all right.

1293
01:12:42,390 --> 01:12:44,026
A'ight.

1294
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,430
Shining so bright.

1295
01:12:50,565 --> 01:12:53,101
The way you fight...

1296
01:12:53,135 --> 01:12:54,937
anger's your biggest tool.

1297
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:58,040
Fighting angry, that drains you

1298
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:00,208
twice as fast.

1299
01:13:03,645 --> 01:13:06,514
The other guy...
in the ring is your enemy,

1300
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:10,252
but if all you trying to do
is kill him,

1301
01:13:10,285 --> 01:13:12,054
then you expose yourself.

1302
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:14,556
You leave yourself vulnerable.

1303
01:13:14,589 --> 01:13:16,491
Got to protect yourself.

1304
01:13:16,524 --> 01:13:20,428
Make his mistakes...
be his destruction.

1305
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:23,031
Right now, you got two weapons:

1306
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,200
a shotgun and a grenade.

1307
01:13:25,233 --> 01:13:28,036
All power, no precision.

1308
01:13:28,070 --> 01:13:30,939
I want you to use
your other arsenal.

1309
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:32,540
There you go, tap.

1310
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:37,079
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

1311
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:39,014
There you go.

1312
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:40,582
One, two.

1313
01:13:40,615 --> 01:13:42,217
Yeah... one, two, yeah.

1314
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:45,387
Pow, pow, yeah.
Pow, pow, yeah.

1315
01:13:45,420 --> 01:13:46,421
Yeah.

1316
01:13:47,522 --> 01:13:49,257
This is what we're gonna do.

1317
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,394
This is the wall, right here.

1318
01:13:52,427 --> 01:13:55,097
My back's against the wall.

1319
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:58,166
It's part of the wall.
Blocking my chin.

1320
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,701
Huh? Shielding yourself.

1321
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:02,604
A block,
anything that comes that way.

1322
01:14:02,637 --> 01:14:05,307
You're right here,
step and slide forward,

1323
01:14:05,340 --> 01:14:07,542
roll...

1324
01:14:07,575 --> 01:14:09,244
just step and slide.

1325
01:14:09,277 --> 01:14:11,213
Forward, roll.

1326
01:14:11,246 --> 01:14:13,782
This is the angle,
this is the angle.

1327
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:15,283
All right?

1328
01:14:15,317 --> 01:14:16,451
Let's do it real slow.

1329
01:14:16,484 --> 01:14:18,520
Take your time. Let's do it.

1330
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:23,758
My-my wife would've liked you.

1331
01:14:24,993 --> 01:14:26,294
I appreciate that.

1332
01:14:27,562 --> 01:14:29,097
Let's do this, all right?

1333
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:30,933
I'm serious.

1334
01:14:38,673 --> 01:14:40,142
Good, looking good.

1335
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:42,077
Good, good.

1336
01:14:42,110 --> 01:14:44,179
Good. Slide it.

1337
01:14:44,212 --> 01:14:45,848
Yeah, I hear it now.

1338
01:14:45,881 --> 01:14:47,149
Slide it.

1339
01:14:47,182 --> 01:14:49,484
Oh, yeah, I hear it now.

1340
01:14:49,517 --> 01:14:52,254
Step... step...

1341
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,056
Who that is?

1342
01:14:54,089 --> 01:14:56,024
See who that is...
There you go, aah!

1343
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:57,259
That's it. Jab.

1344
01:14:57,292 --> 01:14:58,626
Who that hate?

1345
01:14:58,660 --> 01:15:00,562
Who that hate?
Who that hate?

1346
01:15:00,595 --> 01:15:02,064
Who that hate?

1347
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,866
Who that hate?
Who that hate?

1348
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:06,434
Drop your hands, Don't even
worry about punching right now.

1349
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:08,837
Just back against the wall.
Okay? You're doing good.

1350
01:15:08,871 --> 01:15:10,138
You're doing good, all right?

1351
01:15:11,239 --> 01:15:13,641
Back. See my back? Okay.

1352
01:15:13,675 --> 01:15:15,844
Yeah, keep the back
against the wall.

1353
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,212
You feel that?

1354
01:15:17,245 --> 01:15:18,346
Remember to slide.

1355
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:19,915
Keep making him miss...

1356
01:15:19,948 --> 01:15:21,583
Keep making him miss.

1357
01:15:21,616 --> 01:15:23,585
I'm gonna
introduce you to something

1358
01:15:23,618 --> 01:15:27,655
that you never knew before
called defense.

1359
01:15:27,689 --> 01:15:29,224
- Hey, Ramone?
- Yes, Coach?

1360
01:15:29,257 --> 01:15:31,559
- Come over here.
- I have defense.

1361
01:15:31,593 --> 01:15:35,263
Stop punches with your face...
That's not defense.

1362
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,232
- I want you to spar with him.
- All right.

1363
01:15:37,265 --> 01:15:39,834
- T! Glove him up.
- Like, spar with him?

1364
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,170
Don't worry. He's not gonna
be hitting anything.

1365
01:15:42,204 --> 01:15:44,206
Wait, he's not gonna be hitting anything
or I'm not gonna be hitting anything?

1366
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:47,342
You're not gonna hit nothing.
You work on your defense.

1367
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:49,477
Like, don't hit anything?
Like with my glove?

1368
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:53,248
Don't touch him with your gloves.
Just block.

1369
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:57,119
Hey, champ.

1370
01:15:58,786 --> 01:16:00,855
Move your feet,
move your feet.

1371
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,325
Come on, champ. You got to
turn your body when you block.

1372
01:16:03,358 --> 01:16:06,194
You're just covering up.
Pivot out, pivot out.

1373
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:08,263
Step out, step out.

1374
01:16:08,296 --> 01:16:10,098
Get some distance so
you can move your head.

1375
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:12,734
Don't just stand in front of him.
Use your feet.

1376
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:14,702
Get off the rope.

1377
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,505
Come on, champ.

1378
01:16:17,539 --> 01:16:20,308
Let's see you move.

1379
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:24,446
It's like fighting
a fucking gnat!

1380
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,414
Taking you out
like a boss, motherfucker.

1381
01:16:26,448 --> 01:16:27,916
I heard that.

1382
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,817
And that's 50 for swearing.

1383
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,194
How you doing?

1384
01:16:41,729 --> 01:16:43,765
- Hey, Leila.
- Hey, Talia.

1385
01:16:47,735 --> 01:16:49,471
I need help.

1386
01:16:56,511 --> 01:16:59,281
Lei, what happened
to your glasses, baby?

1387
01:16:59,314 --> 01:17:01,749
They're not cool.

1388
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:03,185
Quiz me.

1389
01:17:03,218 --> 01:17:05,553
I may need
the definitions, too.

1390
01:17:13,095 --> 01:17:15,630
- Dismantle.
- Dismantle.

1391
01:17:15,663 --> 01:17:16,831
D-I-S-

1392
01:17:16,864 --> 01:17:18,666
M-A-N-T-L-E.

1393
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:20,768
You're so smart.

1394
01:17:27,775 --> 01:17:30,278
- Hopelessness.
- Hopelessness.

1395
01:17:30,312 --> 01:17:34,716
H-O-P-E-L-E-S-S-N-E-S-S.

1396
01:17:34,749 --> 01:17:37,819
- Gra... gra...
- That's all.

1397
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:50,832
Although
I see there has been progress,

1398
01:17:50,865 --> 01:17:53,801
unfortunately, Mr. Hope, legal
custody of the child shall remain

1399
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:57,005
with Family Services
until further evaluation.

1400
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,242
Court mandates that
your anger management program

1401
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:05,180
continue for another 30 days, and
visitation will still be supervised.

1402
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:07,549
30? Another 30,
another 30 days?

1403
01:18:07,582 --> 01:18:09,951
Yes, Mr. Hope.

1404
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,556
You're free to go.

1405
01:18:21,429 --> 01:18:23,565
It's too early for this.

1406
01:18:29,671 --> 01:18:31,439
Just a sip.

1407
01:18:34,642 --> 01:18:37,345
What were you doing there
in the courtroom today?

1408
01:18:37,379 --> 01:18:39,347
Take care
of some parking tickets.

1409
01:18:39,381 --> 01:18:41,049
You don't have a car.

1410
01:18:41,083 --> 01:18:42,884
Jaywalking.

1411
01:18:46,988 --> 01:18:49,257
You all right?
How's your eye?

1412
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:50,725
Yeah.

1413
01:18:50,758 --> 01:18:53,728
- How's your eye?
- Now you're being smart.

1414
01:18:53,761 --> 01:18:55,597
No, seriously, what's up
with your eye? What is that?

1415
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,966
Evil blue-eyed devil
just took it from me.

1416
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,035
You know, the thing with you
is that, like,

1417
01:19:01,069 --> 01:19:03,471
sometimes one eye is,
like, cloudy, right?

1418
01:19:03,505 --> 01:19:05,440
And the other one is,
like, sunny.

1419
01:19:05,473 --> 01:19:07,075
Like, cloudy, sunny,
cloudy, sunny.

1420
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:08,376
Close one eye, it's cloudy.

1421
01:19:08,410 --> 01:19:09,777
Close the other eye,
it's sunny.

1422
01:19:09,811 --> 01:19:11,479
I was fighting Buster Quigley.

1423
01:19:11,513 --> 01:19:12,953
Buster Quigley was
a nothing fighter.

1424
01:19:12,980 --> 01:19:14,782
We were in the
middle of a match,

1425
01:19:14,816 --> 01:19:17,385
and I was crushing him,
knocking him to the ground.

1426
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,421
Out of nowhere, he hit me.

1427
01:19:19,454 --> 01:19:21,289
Bam. With a right hand.

1428
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,091
I went down,

1429
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:25,493
my eye went dark.

1430
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:29,131
Doc told me I could
never fight again.

1431
01:19:29,164 --> 01:19:30,698
That's too bad.

1432
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,934
It was tough today in court.

1433
01:19:32,967 --> 01:19:34,769
With your kid.
Sorry about that.

1434
01:19:34,802 --> 01:19:37,905
She doesn't want
to see me, anyway, so...

1435
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:43,145
Don't give up on your kid.

1436
01:19:43,178 --> 01:19:47,182
Hey... that story
even true or is that...

1437
01:19:47,215 --> 01:19:48,950
- It's a fake eye.
- Yeah?

1438
01:19:48,983 --> 01:19:51,286
HMO screwed up,
sent me the wrong color.

1439
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:54,489
It's too much of a hassle
to get them to...

1440
01:19:54,522 --> 01:19:56,558
give it back.

1441
01:19:56,591 --> 01:19:59,361
I like that blue-eyed
devil story better.

1442
01:20:01,529 --> 01:20:03,064
Yeah, me, too.

1443
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:12,874
Hope!

1444
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:17,145
What's up?

1445
01:20:18,546 --> 01:20:20,515
- Give me that.
- Yeah.

1446
01:20:20,548 --> 01:20:21,716
Yo, thanks, Hop.

1447
01:20:21,749 --> 01:20:23,585
Be right back, Hop.

1448
01:20:25,553 --> 01:20:27,689
What's up?

1449
01:20:27,722 --> 01:20:30,492
Lou, uh, is working with
Keith "The Buzz Saw" Brady.

1450
01:20:30,525 --> 01:20:32,327
Light heavyweight kid,
won the Golden Gloves.

1451
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:33,728
Yeah, yeah,
I know him, yeah.

1452
01:20:33,761 --> 01:20:35,697
They're working
at Freddy's gym,

1453
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,532
and they're doing this,
uh, charity event

1454
01:20:37,565 --> 01:20:39,701
for wounded veterans.

1455
01:20:39,734 --> 01:20:42,337
And they want to know
if you want to go eight rounds,

1456
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,138
with Brady, for the cause.

1457
01:20:44,172 --> 01:20:46,508
Yeah, we think that you'd bring
in a lot of people, big crowd.

1458
01:20:46,541 --> 01:20:50,044
Raise a lot of money. It's your
opportunity if you want it, Billy.

1459
01:20:50,077 --> 01:20:52,714
You don't need a license
to fight for a charity, so...

1460
01:20:52,747 --> 01:20:54,582
Good seeing you, Tick.

1461
01:20:54,616 --> 01:20:56,117
- Let me know.
- Yeah.

1462
01:20:56,150 --> 01:20:57,670
- Nice meeting you, Billy.
- All right.

1463
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,726
What do you think?

1464
01:21:04,759 --> 01:21:06,328
It's got one condition.

1465
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:08,196
Better do
what we practiced here.

1466
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:09,931
That's all I ask.

1467
01:21:09,964 --> 01:21:13,268
It is kind of nice
to be wanted, yeah?

1468
01:21:16,137 --> 01:21:18,240
Hey, you know what? Um...

1469
01:21:18,273 --> 01:21:21,209
- Yo, I'm worried about Hoppy.
- What you mean?

1470
01:21:21,243 --> 01:21:24,045
He's been wearing the same set of
clothes for the past two days.

1471
01:21:24,078 --> 01:21:27,249
He said something about his mom and
dad getting in a fight last night,

1472
01:21:27,282 --> 01:21:29,551
and then his dad went out
after his mom left.

1473
01:21:29,584 --> 01:21:31,085
- His mom left?
- Yeah.

1474
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:38,793
His mom having some struggles.

1475
01:21:38,826 --> 01:21:40,695
You should find out
if he's got a place to stay.

1476
01:21:40,728 --> 01:21:42,564
If he's out on the street,
then we can figure out

1477
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,499
where we can put him,
what we need to do, all right?

1478
01:21:44,532 --> 01:21:46,133
All right.

1479
01:21:51,172 --> 01:21:53,441
"Kodug"? Is that a word?

1480
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:55,310
I feel like I've heard
someone say, like, kodug.

1481
01:21:55,343 --> 01:21:58,646
Or Kodug's like a country
or something like that.

1482
01:21:58,680 --> 01:22:01,649
Can we just
get out of here?

1483
01:22:01,683 --> 01:22:04,419
Baby, the, um...

1484
01:22:04,452 --> 01:22:06,721
the judge, um...

1485
01:22:06,754 --> 01:22:10,658
said it's gonna be
another month.

1486
01:22:13,595 --> 01:22:15,730
I'm gonna fight again.

1487
01:22:17,765 --> 01:22:21,269
- What?
- I mean, it's a charity thing, you know what I mean?

1488
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,605
It's not like a real,
like a professional fight.

1489
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:24,939
You know, it's an exhibition.

1490
01:22:24,972 --> 01:22:28,310
Um, but, um...

1491
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:30,545
I'm gonna fight again.

1492
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:32,580
- Can I go?
- Now, you know Mommy

1493
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:34,316
didn't like you
watching the fights.

1494
01:22:34,349 --> 01:22:35,917
Well, somebody has to be there.

1495
01:22:35,950 --> 01:22:38,386
Yeah, baby,
I'll, I'll, I'll be okay.

1496
01:22:38,420 --> 01:22:41,956
- But I want to go.
- I don't think I can work that out.

1497
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:44,191
Then-then you can't do it.

1498
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:46,328
Dad, you have to tell them
you can't do it.

1499
01:22:46,361 --> 01:22:47,929
Leila, I got, I got to do it.

1500
01:22:47,962 --> 01:22:49,964
No, you can't.
I have to be there, Dad.

1501
01:22:49,997 --> 01:22:51,599
Baby, I am trying
to get you out, just...

1502
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,900
- When?
- Leila...

1503
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:54,602
- When?!
- Leila, I'm trying.

1504
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,037
When?!

1505
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,345
You...

1506
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:04,546
I hate you.

1507
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,414
I hate you!

1508
01:23:06,448 --> 01:23:08,550
Why can't you just get me
out of this place?!

1509
01:23:08,583 --> 01:23:09,917
- Leila...
- Why are you not...

1510
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:12,654
I can't. I can't right now.

1511
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:14,356
- Baby, please.
- I don't trust you!

1512
01:23:14,389 --> 01:23:16,023
Just trust me.
Come on, baby!

1513
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:18,125
You keep making promises,
and you don't mean them!

1514
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,927
- That's not true.
- Leila, just calm down.

1515
01:23:19,961 --> 01:23:21,829
You should've been the one
that was killed.

1516
01:23:21,863 --> 01:23:24,399
- You, not Mom!
- It's okay, it's okay.

1517
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:25,767
- You!
- Come with me.

1518
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:27,569
- Let's calm down.
- You! You!

1519
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:29,571
I hate you!

1520
01:23:53,861 --> 01:23:55,630
Ooh, that defense
looking good, Billy!

1521
01:24:05,072 --> 01:24:07,308
Nice! That's the way
to block! Way to block!

1522
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,400
Keep that distance,
keep that distance.

1523
01:24:16,818 --> 01:24:18,252
Jab, jab, jab, jab...!

1524
01:24:18,285 --> 01:24:19,554
Good!

1525
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,656
Keep moving.

1526
01:24:26,994 --> 01:24:29,130
- He could last another round.
- You could be right.

1527
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:33,701
Time! Time.

1528
01:24:33,735 --> 01:24:35,870
To your corners. Corners.

1529
01:24:38,806 --> 01:24:42,076
Give me the towel,
give me the towel.

1530
01:24:42,109 --> 01:24:43,945
His jabs aren't quitting.

1531
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,513
Keep your hands up, 'cause
you're dropping your hands.

1532
01:24:45,547 --> 01:24:47,615
Just keep jabbing.
Keep jabbing.

1533
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,250
This round, this round...

1534
01:24:49,283 --> 01:24:50,885
I need you to be
a little more aggressive, okay?

1535
01:24:50,918 --> 01:24:52,554
Just for points, not for blood.

1536
01:24:52,587 --> 01:24:55,122
Keep your calm.
Tap, tap, tap.

1537
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:57,725
Seconds out.

1538
01:24:57,759 --> 01:25:00,027
Let's go, let's go.

1539
01:25:04,832 --> 01:25:06,133
Go the distance.

1540
01:25:11,506 --> 01:25:12,840
Box!

1541
01:25:17,645 --> 01:25:19,547
Keep your head moving.

1542
01:25:19,581 --> 01:25:21,382
Move the body!
Way to move the body!

1543
01:25:21,415 --> 01:25:22,495
There you go, there you go.

1544
01:25:25,687 --> 01:25:26,821
That's it!

1545
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:30,792
- Keep jabbing!
- Go!

1546
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:35,362
There you go!

1547
01:25:35,396 --> 01:25:36,798
That's it!

1548
01:25:38,365 --> 01:25:39,701
Jab, jab, jab, jab!

1549
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:43,663
Keep moving!

1550
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:46,273
Just jab, just jab!

1551
01:26:01,388 --> 01:26:02,724
That's it!

1552
01:26:02,757 --> 01:26:04,325
- Way to go! Way to go!
- Damn!

1553
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:09,196
Three! Four!

1554
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,365
Five! Six!

1555
01:26:11,398 --> 01:26:13,200
Seven!

1556
01:26:13,234 --> 01:26:15,570
- Eight! Nine!
- Way to go, baby!

1557
01:26:15,603 --> 01:26:16,904
Ten!

1558
01:26:16,938 --> 01:26:18,740
That's it!

1559
01:26:21,576 --> 01:26:23,978
Yeah, Billy!

1560
01:26:25,947 --> 01:26:28,115
All right, will you just
tell her that I called

1561
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:30,885
and that, uh,
tell Leila I'm okay,

1562
01:26:30,918 --> 01:26:33,655
and Daddy won.

1563
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:34,989
Yeah, oh, thanks, yeah.

1564
01:26:35,022 --> 01:26:37,925
Yeah, thank you.

1565
01:26:39,627 --> 01:26:41,529
Beautiful.

1566
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:43,364
Beautiful fight, man.

1567
01:26:45,700 --> 01:26:47,569
Beautiful fight, man.

1568
01:26:47,602 --> 01:26:50,337
You looked great,
like a whole 'nother fighter.

1569
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,073
Yeah, thanks.

1570
01:26:53,374 --> 01:26:55,442
Can I talk to you?

1571
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,682
What do you want to talk about?

1572
01:27:00,715 --> 01:27:02,183
I came to see you, man.

1573
01:27:02,216 --> 01:27:04,719
Well, you should
be looking at Brady.

1574
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:08,756
You know me, I like to stick
with the sure thing.

1575
01:27:08,790 --> 01:27:11,058
Congratulations
on that title fight.

1576
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:13,194
I heard Miguel didn't have
a hard time with Turay.

1577
01:27:13,227 --> 01:27:15,362
How'd you like to fight
for that title?

1578
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,865
Yeah, cut the bullshit,
all right?

1579
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:21,335
Look, you needed some time off. Now
it's time to get you back on top.

1580
01:27:21,368 --> 01:27:24,606
- What are you saying?
- I got some friends down at the FAC.

1581
01:27:24,639 --> 01:27:27,642
They owe me some favors. I think
I can get you a early review,

1582
01:27:27,675 --> 01:27:29,410
get your license back.

1583
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:31,512
The changes you've made in
the past couple of months,

1584
01:27:31,545 --> 01:27:33,848
I think the changes
speak for themselves.

1585
01:27:34,982 --> 01:27:36,718
What's the plan?

1586
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,953
Vegas, six weeks.

1587
01:27:38,986 --> 01:27:41,122
It's a big one.

1588
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:44,892
Hey, Tick.

1589
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:46,293
Jordan.

1590
01:27:46,327 --> 01:27:47,895
You did a great job
with your fighter.

1591
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:49,363
He works hard.

1592
01:27:49,396 --> 01:27:51,733
Coach, I'm gonna
put this stuff in the van.

1593
01:27:51,766 --> 01:27:53,067
- Yeah, thanks, Jon.
- Yeah.

1594
01:27:53,100 --> 01:27:55,036
It's a great opportunity, Billy.

1595
01:27:55,069 --> 01:27:57,138
I'll be in touch.

1596
01:28:02,009 --> 01:28:03,945
What's that about?

1597
01:28:03,978 --> 01:28:06,180
Title shot, Vegas, six weeks.

1598
01:28:06,213 --> 01:28:07,949
Really?

1599
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:09,751
Six weeks?

1600
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,085
You know what
that's about, right?

1601
01:28:11,118 --> 01:28:13,354
- Yeah.
- He's gonna sell it

1602
01:28:13,387 --> 01:28:16,357
like it's a-a revenge match
around the murder of your wife.

1603
01:28:16,390 --> 01:28:19,526
Yeah, it'll all be about Mo.

1604
01:28:19,560 --> 01:28:20,928
You're not considering it?

1605
01:28:20,962 --> 01:28:22,664
Yeah.

1606
01:28:22,697 --> 01:28:25,967
I got to make some money, man.

1607
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:28,502
I can't lose my girl.

1608
01:28:28,535 --> 01:28:30,805
This man right here...
You fell down to the ground,

1609
01:28:30,838 --> 01:28:32,373
he just stepped right over you.

1610
01:28:32,406 --> 01:28:34,108
He fixes fights.

1611
01:28:34,141 --> 01:28:35,643
He's a liar.

1612
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,111
Yeah, look, I'm not
talking about him.

1613
01:28:37,144 --> 01:28:38,345
I'm talking about you.

1614
01:28:38,379 --> 01:28:40,782
I can't do this without you.

1615
01:28:40,815 --> 01:28:42,583
I can't do this with you.

1616
01:28:42,616 --> 01:28:44,752
Why?

1617
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:46,420
I don't train pro fighters.

1618
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:48,656
What, you're saying to me
that someone came in

1619
01:28:48,690 --> 01:28:51,130
and offered the boys a pro shot,
you wouldn't give it to them?

1620
01:28:53,795 --> 01:28:56,664
All I need is the six weeks.

1621
01:28:56,698 --> 01:28:58,900
I need six weeks.

1622
01:28:58,933 --> 01:29:00,835
I'll give you my everything.

1623
01:29:00,868 --> 01:29:03,104
You get my everything.

1624
01:29:03,137 --> 01:29:05,206
This is about my family.

1625
01:29:08,976 --> 01:29:11,378
I can't lose my daughter.

1626
01:29:16,784 --> 01:29:18,119
Tick?

1627
01:29:19,553 --> 01:29:22,223
I got nothing
to say to you, man.

1628
01:29:51,919 --> 01:29:53,220
Tick.

1629
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:56,357
Who's winning?

1630
01:30:04,698 --> 01:30:07,334
You know Hoppy died?

1631
01:30:08,669 --> 01:30:10,071
What?

1632
01:30:10,104 --> 01:30:11,939
He tried to protect his mom,

1633
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:13,975
and his dad shot him.

1634
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,043
He's dead.

1635
01:30:42,736 --> 01:30:44,171
I should've known.

1636
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,273
When you told me
that his mom left,

1637
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,709
I should've known right then.

1638
01:30:52,646 --> 01:30:56,017
You're supposed to be able
to protect them, you know?

1639
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:58,519
These kids coming up in here,

1640
01:30:58,552 --> 01:31:01,222
I'm telling them a bunch
of stuff that's bullshit.

1641
01:31:01,255 --> 01:31:02,990
It's bullshit.

1642
01:31:03,024 --> 01:31:04,826
"It's gonna be all right."

1643
01:31:04,859 --> 01:31:06,693
"You can control your destiny."

1644
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:10,231
"You could control this,
you could control that."

1645
01:31:10,264 --> 01:31:12,633
You can't control shit.

1646
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,301
What the fuck, man?

1647
01:31:18,772 --> 01:31:21,608
The fuck?

1648
01:31:21,642 --> 01:31:24,311
What is this?

1649
01:31:24,345 --> 01:31:27,281
What kind of,
what kind of shit is this?

1650
01:31:31,252 --> 01:31:33,687
God must have some kind of plan

1651
01:31:33,720 --> 01:31:36,323
to teach me

1652
01:31:36,357 --> 01:31:38,492
some kind of lesson.

1653
01:31:38,525 --> 01:31:40,727
I just can't figure out
what it is.

1654
01:31:49,770 --> 01:31:51,705
You know what Hoppy told me?

1655
01:31:51,738 --> 01:31:56,743
- Hmm?
- "You're a dream crusher."

1656
01:31:56,777 --> 01:31:58,445
Uh...

1657
01:31:58,479 --> 01:32:00,247
it's like, it's like, when, uh,

1658
01:32:00,281 --> 01:32:03,384
one of them, one of them-them
games they play.

1659
01:32:03,417 --> 01:32:05,953
I-I'm the Dream Crusher.

1660
01:32:12,226 --> 01:32:15,096
That's like, you know,

1661
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:16,898
crazy stuff, right?

1662
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:21,635
So maybe I'm supposed to learn
how not to be a dream crusher.

1663
01:32:21,668 --> 01:32:24,071
You know what I'm saying?

1664
01:32:24,105 --> 01:32:27,508
Why stop now?

1665
01:32:29,376 --> 01:32:32,980
You think that you can, uh...

1666
01:32:33,014 --> 01:32:35,782
beat Magic?

1667
01:32:35,816 --> 01:32:37,851
No.

1668
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,686
I can't beat him.

1669
01:32:39,720 --> 01:32:41,488
Not without you.

1670
01:32:41,522 --> 01:32:43,958
Promise me something.

1671
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:46,660
- Mm-hmm.
- Whatever happens,

1672
01:32:46,693 --> 01:32:48,562
you'll still keep
taking care of yourself,

1673
01:32:48,595 --> 01:32:51,165
and you'll take care
of your daughter.

1674
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:54,635
Mr. Hope,

1675
01:32:54,668 --> 01:32:56,803
after careful review
of your file,

1676
01:32:56,837 --> 01:32:59,273
including the assessment
from your case worker,

1677
01:32:59,306 --> 01:33:02,209
I'm gonna remove
the visitation restrictions,

1678
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:04,678
and the reunification
can begin next week.

1679
01:33:04,711 --> 01:33:07,949
You attorney will receive
notification in the mail.

1680
01:33:07,982 --> 01:33:09,850
Good job, Mr. Hope.

1681
01:33:13,687 --> 01:33:15,856
Thank you.

1682
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:27,034
- You have new shoes?
- No, I've had these.

1683
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:28,669
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

1684
01:33:28,702 --> 01:33:31,305
Baby, I don't remember
those shoes. Remember...

1685
01:33:31,338 --> 01:33:34,175
I don't have that much food here,
baby, but I can make you an egg.

1686
01:33:34,208 --> 01:33:35,542
You want an egg?

1687
01:33:40,447 --> 01:33:42,816
No, why aren't you eating?
What's wrong, baby?

1688
01:33:42,849 --> 01:33:45,619
- Why didn't you eat anything?
- You think I'm a baby.

1689
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:49,090
- I don't think you're a baby.
- Then how come you won't let me come?

1690
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:51,959
Look, 'cause I told you,
I told you it wasn't up to me.

1691
01:33:51,993 --> 01:33:54,361
Well, it's up to you now.

1692
01:33:58,365 --> 01:34:01,768
Look, when Mom,
when Mom was... you...

1693
01:34:04,871 --> 01:34:06,740
...around, you know,

1694
01:34:06,773 --> 01:34:10,211
she was the one who always made
all the decisions, you know?

1695
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:12,913
For you, for me,
and...

1696
01:34:14,648 --> 01:34:18,252
me, I can't
make them, you know?

1697
01:34:18,285 --> 01:34:20,521
Not so much.

1698
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:22,456
I know.

1699
01:34:22,489 --> 01:34:24,958
What do you know?

1700
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:28,429
Mom always said
we had to take care of you.

1701
01:34:32,366 --> 01:34:35,402
No, baby, that's not how
it's supposed to work.

1702
01:34:35,436 --> 01:34:37,404
All right? I'm supposed
to take care of you.

1703
01:34:37,438 --> 01:34:40,007
But the truth is,
I'm hanging on

1704
01:34:40,041 --> 01:34:41,775
by a thread here.

1705
01:34:47,448 --> 01:34:49,283
You sure you don't want
to eat something?

1706
01:34:49,316 --> 01:34:50,984
Just, just...

1707
01:34:51,018 --> 01:34:52,519
No, Dad.

1708
01:34:58,225 --> 01:35:00,927
Can we go see her?

1709
01:35:30,457 --> 01:35:32,493
I miss you a lot, Mom.

1710
01:35:42,936 --> 01:35:45,072
More-more than ever.

1711
01:36:04,258 --> 01:36:06,026
Hey.

1712
01:36:07,528 --> 01:36:09,263
The guy that I'm fighting,

1713
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:12,699
he's the guy from the hotel
when-when Mommy was killed.

1714
01:36:14,067 --> 01:36:15,736
Okay?

1715
01:36:15,769 --> 01:36:18,105
They're gonna say
a lot of crazy things.

1716
01:36:18,139 --> 01:36:21,074
All right?

1717
01:36:21,108 --> 01:36:23,076
I have to be there.

1718
01:36:23,110 --> 01:36:25,479
It's gonna scare you.

1719
01:36:25,512 --> 01:36:28,749
Did Mommy get scared?

1720
01:36:31,118 --> 01:36:33,254
All the time.

1721
01:36:33,287 --> 01:36:35,422
Okay.

1722
01:36:36,590 --> 01:36:38,659
I'll wait in the dressing room.

1723
01:36:38,692 --> 01:36:41,362
But I have to be there.

1724
01:36:48,169 --> 01:36:50,871
Okay, you got a deal, baby.

1725
01:37:22,603 --> 01:37:24,037
You can do this.
You're stronger than that.

1726
01:37:24,070 --> 01:37:26,773
They say Billy Hope
can't make it.

1727
01:37:26,807 --> 01:37:28,842
They say Billy Hope is over.

1728
01:37:28,875 --> 01:37:31,712
You!
You define yourself.

1729
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:49,796
I want you to
switch and go southpaw.

1730
01:37:49,830 --> 01:37:51,898
Have the foot
move through with you.

1731
01:37:51,932 --> 01:37:54,868
Same time... it's like
it's connected by a string.

1732
01:37:54,901 --> 01:37:56,603
Same time that leg's
moving with that hand.

1733
01:37:56,637 --> 01:37:58,439
See how it's coming
at the same time?

1734
01:37:58,472 --> 01:38:00,874
You switch, then the right foot
has to land with a hook.

1735
01:38:03,310 --> 01:38:06,613
Do what you gotta do,
to do what you want to do.

1736
01:38:06,647 --> 01:38:08,181
That's Magic.

1737
01:38:14,721 --> 01:38:17,157
Time, time.
I need to see the shuttle.

1738
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:19,159
- Shuttle? All right.
- I need to see the pivot.

1739
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:32,239
Time!

1740
01:38:48,221 --> 01:38:50,691
Come on!

1741
01:39:21,422 --> 01:39:24,325
Hello again, I'm Jim Lampley,

1742
01:39:24,358 --> 01:39:27,027
along with the pound-for-pound
king of the '90s, Roy Jones,

1743
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,195
here in Las Vegas
at Caesar's Palace...

1744
01:39:29,229 --> 01:39:31,665
as we welcome you live
to our coverage

1745
01:39:31,698 --> 01:39:33,800
of the Light Heavyweight
Title showdown

1746
01:39:33,834 --> 01:39:37,270
between existing titlist
Miguel Escobar

1747
01:39:37,304 --> 01:39:39,306
and former champion Billy Hope.

1748
01:39:39,340 --> 01:39:41,975
Roy, throughout the boxing
world, there's hope...

1749
01:39:42,008 --> 01:39:43,977
You can't avoid saying it...

1750
01:39:44,010 --> 01:39:47,581
That this evening could produce
a great story

1751
01:39:47,614 --> 01:39:51,151
of redemption for Billy Hope, who's been
through so much, but realistically,

1752
01:39:51,184 --> 01:39:54,187
what chance is there that Hope
could come back and win

1753
01:39:54,220 --> 01:39:56,423
against such a skilled
and effective

1754
01:39:56,457 --> 01:39:58,158
young champion as Escobar?

1755
01:39:58,191 --> 01:40:00,160
The cards
are stacked against Hope.

1756
01:40:00,193 --> 01:40:02,262
Um, his age, um,
the fact that he's been off,

1757
01:40:02,295 --> 01:40:05,065
and this guy is probably
the best fighter

1758
01:40:05,098 --> 01:40:07,300
that will ever be put
in front of Hope.

1759
01:40:15,609 --> 01:40:17,678
Billy Hope, entering first,

1760
01:40:17,711 --> 01:40:20,347
with no entry music,

1761
01:40:20,381 --> 01:40:25,051
flanked by his new trainer,
Tick Wills.

1762
01:40:25,085 --> 01:40:27,421
The ultimate revenge motive
for Hope tonight,

1763
01:40:27,454 --> 01:40:29,556
'cause his heart, he believes

1764
01:40:29,590 --> 01:40:32,726
he's avenging the death of
his wife in a bizarre incident

1765
01:40:32,759 --> 01:40:34,695
in which Escobar was involved,

1766
01:40:34,728 --> 01:40:37,898
an incident for which no perpetrator
has ever paid the price.

1767
01:40:37,931 --> 01:40:41,167
What about the
choice of walking with no music, Roy?

1768
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:44,104
Anytime you've got
a crowd of this magnitude

1769
01:40:44,137 --> 01:40:46,673
and so much energy
in one building,

1770
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:48,709
really, you don't need music.

1771
01:40:48,742 --> 01:40:51,478
Billy Hope, in the
six-week build-up to this fight,

1772
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:53,980
has kept saying,
"All business, all business.

1773
01:40:54,014 --> 01:40:56,049
"This isn't about
all that other stuff.

1774
01:40:56,082 --> 01:40:58,452
It's just about
we're going to fight."

1775
01:41:05,025 --> 01:41:06,760
...the king of kings!

1776
01:41:06,793 --> 01:41:08,662
And here comes Miguel Escobar.

1777
01:41:08,695 --> 01:41:12,165
Escobar is a product
of Colombia.

1778
01:41:16,302 --> 01:41:19,740
In the past, Roy Jones, when we
spoke about fighters from Colombia,

1779
01:41:19,773 --> 01:41:24,711
almost always, they were big punchers.
This is a different story.

1780
01:41:24,745 --> 01:41:26,747
Yeah, this is
a whole different story.

1781
01:41:26,780 --> 01:41:28,715
Not often do we talk about
Colombian fighters

1782
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:30,451
and talk about
the full package.

1783
01:41:30,484 --> 01:41:32,352
Most of them come
with an astronomical amount

1784
01:41:32,385 --> 01:41:35,255
of punching power,
but not skills to match that.

1785
01:41:35,288 --> 01:41:38,224
Tonight we have a guy
who is just as good

1786
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:40,894
offensively, skill-wise,
as he is powerful.

1787
01:41:40,927 --> 01:41:43,830
I said, more recently,
Sergio Martinez,

1788
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:45,966
but Carlos Melzon was a beast,

1789
01:41:45,999 --> 01:41:48,168
but this kid
is a boxer-puncher

1790
01:41:48,201 --> 01:41:51,505
with great speed, great power...
Something to see, Jim.

1791
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:52,973
He's no champ!

1792
01:41:53,006 --> 01:41:55,141
And Escobar now promoted

1793
01:41:55,175 --> 01:41:56,577
by Jordan Mains,

1794
01:41:56,610 --> 01:42:01,347
the man who architected
Billy Hope's career.

1795
01:42:05,251 --> 01:42:06,753
You have a good fight.

1796
01:42:06,787 --> 01:42:09,422
I only gave him
six weeks to train.

1797
01:42:11,658 --> 01:42:13,059
- Jon Jon?
- Yeah?

1798
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:14,995
Slip it off.

1799
01:42:15,028 --> 01:42:17,998
You don't have to watch it if
you don't want to. You okay?

1800
01:42:18,031 --> 01:42:20,200
And if the defection

1801
01:42:20,233 --> 01:42:23,103
of Jordan Mains weren't enough,
Hope's longtime trainer,

1802
01:42:23,136 --> 01:42:27,407
Eli Frost, trains Escobar
against him tonight.

1803
01:42:27,440 --> 01:42:30,143
Okay,
gentlemen, you both received

1804
01:42:30,176 --> 01:42:32,178
your instructions
in the dressing room.

1805
01:42:32,212 --> 01:42:34,615
Okay, I want
a good, clean fight.

1806
01:42:34,648 --> 01:42:36,416
Obey my commands at all times.

1807
01:42:36,449 --> 01:42:38,752
Above all,
protect yourself at all times.

1808
01:42:38,785 --> 01:42:40,887
Let's go.

1809
01:42:40,921 --> 01:42:42,956
Tony Weeks says

1810
01:42:42,989 --> 01:42:44,925
he wants a good, clean fight.

1811
01:42:44,958 --> 01:42:47,160
Quite a number
of ring observers

1812
01:42:47,193 --> 01:42:50,697
expect that's the last thing we
have any chance of seeing here,

1813
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:53,900
given the rising tide
of emotions

1814
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:57,170
in both corners
as round one begins.

1815
01:42:57,203 --> 01:42:59,439
- You begin!
- Logic tells you

1816
01:42:59,472 --> 01:43:01,908
that in the casting
of this fight,

1817
01:43:01,942 --> 01:43:04,845
Escobar is the superior boxer,

1818
01:43:04,878 --> 01:43:08,214
Billy Hope
the more physical brawler.

1819
01:43:08,248 --> 01:43:09,850
You have to make him miss!
Make him miss!

1820
01:43:09,883 --> 01:43:11,685
Come on, son!

1821
01:43:11,718 --> 01:43:14,287
And early on,
Escobar getting off,

1822
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:17,357
but Hope comes back.

1823
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:19,259
Go to body shots! Go to
the body! Go to the body!

1824
01:43:19,292 --> 01:43:21,795
Come on! Apply that pressure!

1825
01:43:21,828 --> 01:43:23,263
Put it on him now!

1826
01:43:23,296 --> 01:43:26,066
Escobar with the showboat.
Look at him.

1827
01:43:26,099 --> 01:43:28,602
Trying to take
Billy's confidence.

1828
01:43:28,635 --> 01:43:30,336
Come on, Billy,
now, come on.

1829
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:32,338
Escobar energetic,
bouncing on his feet.

1830
01:43:32,372 --> 01:43:34,107
Escobar seems to be able to get

1831
01:43:34,140 --> 01:43:36,242
anything that he wants...
He can hit him

1832
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:39,580
with a straight right, he can
hit him with a left hook...

1833
01:43:39,613 --> 01:43:42,448
Nice slip! Nice slip!

1834
01:43:42,482 --> 01:43:45,385
Billy Hope already with a mark

1835
01:43:45,418 --> 01:43:48,454
- above the left eye.
- He's holding, ref! He's holding!

1836
01:43:48,488 --> 01:43:51,124
Let him go. I got you.
Let him go.

1837
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:57,497
Escobar is hitting him, and
Tony Weeks steps in, in the corner.

1838
01:43:57,530 --> 01:44:00,300
- You didn't see that?
- Let me see, let me see.

1839
01:44:00,333 --> 01:44:03,804
It appears that Escobar has
drawn blood right here in round one.

1840
01:44:03,837 --> 01:44:06,172
Well, Hope did his best

1841
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:08,141
to make Escobar pay
in round one.

1842
01:44:08,174 --> 01:44:10,977
What he wasn't able to do
was make him miss.

1843
01:44:11,011 --> 01:44:13,146
He's a fast motherfucker.

1844
01:44:13,179 --> 01:44:14,815
That's all right, that's all right.
You faster.

1845
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:17,450
Don't worry about that.
Just do what we worked on.

1846
01:44:17,483 --> 01:44:20,453
You make him miss, make him pay.
All right?

1847
01:44:20,486 --> 01:44:25,225
By now, fans well
aware of the difficult passage

1848
01:44:25,258 --> 01:44:28,428
Hope has been through...
The loss of everything, really,

1849
01:44:28,461 --> 01:44:30,463
that was valuable to him,
including the loss,

1850
01:44:30,496 --> 01:44:32,966
for a period of time,
of his hunger to fight.

1851
01:44:32,999 --> 01:44:34,601
Come on, Billy!

1852
01:44:34,635 --> 01:44:37,437
Round two begins, and it's Hope

1853
01:44:37,470 --> 01:44:40,106
who's the aggressor
at the beginning.

1854
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,643
Now Escobar counters back.

1855
01:44:42,676 --> 01:44:45,478
- Your defense! Come on!
- And Billy's doing

1856
01:44:45,511 --> 01:44:48,181
just the opposite of what
a boxer is supposed to do.

1857
01:44:48,214 --> 01:44:50,450
You're supposed to hit
and not get hit.

1858
01:44:50,483 --> 01:44:52,385
Billy is not hitting,

1859
01:44:52,418 --> 01:44:54,454
and getting the hell
knocked out of him.

1860
01:44:54,487 --> 01:44:56,327
Come on, Billy, move
your head, move your head!

1861
01:44:56,356 --> 01:44:58,659
Early on,
it looks like Escobar's jab

1862
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:00,894
is too quick for Billy Hope.

1863
01:45:00,927 --> 01:45:04,264
Escobar working
downstairs and up,

1864
01:45:04,297 --> 01:45:06,967
following the body shots
with hard punches upstairs.

1865
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:11,638
Good exchange right there

1866
01:45:11,672 --> 01:45:13,139
before Tony separated them.

1867
01:45:13,173 --> 01:45:15,842
Come on, baby,
you got this.

1868
01:45:15,876 --> 01:45:18,044
Watch that right.
Just keep the pace.

1869
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:19,680
Use your speed.
Work your way inside.

1870
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:21,481
Let's go, Billy!
Don't give up, boy!

1871
01:45:22,916 --> 01:45:24,317
First couple rounds

1872
01:45:24,350 --> 01:45:26,152
seem to have gone
Escobar's way.

1873
01:45:26,186 --> 01:45:28,621
Let's see if Hope
can raise his energy level

1874
01:45:28,655 --> 01:45:30,123
and make it more of a fight.

1875
01:45:30,156 --> 01:45:31,792
Move your head!
Move your head!

1876
01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:33,059
Keep, keep him up!

1877
01:45:49,375 --> 01:45:51,544
High time for Hope

1878
01:45:51,577 --> 01:45:54,681
to begin working to the body
and try to turn things around.

1879
01:45:54,715 --> 01:45:56,616
Three left hooks
to the ribcage.

1880
01:45:56,649 --> 01:45:58,819
Escobar catches him
with a right.

1881
01:45:58,852 --> 01:46:01,822
Down goes Hope.

1882
01:46:01,855 --> 01:46:03,423
First knockdown of the fight.

1883
01:46:03,456 --> 01:46:05,726
...three, four,

1884
01:46:05,759 --> 01:46:07,828
- Get up, baby!
- Five...

1885
01:46:07,861 --> 01:46:09,796
six...

1886
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:11,397
Get up! Get up!

1887
01:46:11,431 --> 01:46:14,000
That left eye
is bleeding freely.

1888
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:18,604
You all right? You okay?
All right, sit down.

1889
01:46:18,638 --> 01:46:20,040
No, no, no. His eye.

1890
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:21,507
He's hurt!

1891
01:46:21,541 --> 01:46:23,276
And it looks already as though

1892
01:46:23,309 --> 01:46:26,079
things may be slipping away
from Billy Hope.

1893
01:46:26,112 --> 01:46:28,148
You got to keep
the pressure on, baby.

1894
01:46:28,181 --> 01:46:30,250
Don't worry about
the eye, I got the eye.

1895
01:46:30,283 --> 01:46:32,285
That's a
gruesome-looking left eye...

1896
01:46:32,318 --> 01:46:33,954
If there was a problem,
they would stop the fight...

1897
01:46:33,987 --> 01:46:35,655
There's not a problem, okay?

1898
01:46:35,688 --> 01:46:37,323
- How's it look, Doc?
- I can see.

1899
01:46:37,357 --> 01:46:39,259
- He's all right.
- Yeah, he's good to go.

1900
01:46:39,292 --> 01:46:40,693
- Good! Good!
- Good to go.

1901
01:46:40,727 --> 01:46:42,662
Well, Hope's fans would say

1902
01:46:42,695 --> 01:46:45,031
it wouldn't be Billy
if he weren't bleeding.

1903
01:46:45,065 --> 01:46:47,267
Show him.
It's time to show him, baby.

1904
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:48,634
Time to show him this time.

1905
01:46:51,604 --> 01:46:55,041
Back in the center of the ring.

1906
01:46:55,075 --> 01:46:56,709
Hope unloading
right-hand leads.

1907
01:46:56,743 --> 01:46:58,745
- Come on, Billy, show up!
- Hope trying to tuck

1908
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:01,647
that injured left eye
behind his front shoulder.

1909
01:47:01,681 --> 01:47:05,251
And Tick must be like
his Freddie Roach to Miguel Cotto,

1910
01:47:05,285 --> 01:47:07,821
because Tick has done
a great job with his defense.

1911
01:47:07,854 --> 01:47:10,824
Almost as though, Roy,
Billy Hope didn't show up again

1912
01:47:10,857 --> 01:47:13,726
till the blood started to flow
from that left eye.

1913
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:15,728
Now Billy's showing up, Jim.

1914
01:47:15,762 --> 01:47:19,332
I have never seen
Billy Hope block a punch.

1915
01:47:19,365 --> 01:47:22,202
- This is unbelievable. Look at him.
- Nice!

1916
01:47:22,235 --> 01:47:26,339
What a good three-punch
combination out of the shoulder roll

1917
01:47:26,372 --> 01:47:28,274
right there, from Billy Hope.

1918
01:47:28,308 --> 01:47:31,077
Come on, Billy!

1919
01:47:31,111 --> 01:47:34,047
This is
Hope's best round so far.

1920
01:47:38,284 --> 01:47:40,353
That's it! That's it!

1921
01:47:40,386 --> 01:47:42,555
And they're talking
to each other

1922
01:47:42,588 --> 01:47:45,258
in the center of the ring.

1923
01:47:45,291 --> 01:47:47,093
Good.
Stay in the shell.

1924
01:47:47,127 --> 01:47:49,462
Protect yourself. He's
switching his style up on us.

1925
01:47:49,495 --> 01:47:51,331
- He's rolling his shoulder.
- I can't hit that motherfucker.

1926
01:47:51,364 --> 01:47:53,766
- How's it looking, Doc?
- We got this, we got this.

1927
01:47:53,800 --> 01:47:56,069
- I'm good, Doc.
- Okay, yeah, you're good to go.

1928
01:47:56,102 --> 01:47:57,337
Get the fuck...

1929
01:47:59,305 --> 01:48:01,474
You know who you are? You're a champion.
You can do it!

1930
01:48:01,507 --> 01:48:02,843
This is yours, all right?

1931
01:48:02,876 --> 01:48:03,844
You're a champion.

1932
01:48:03,877 --> 01:48:05,378
Let's go!

1933
01:48:05,411 --> 01:48:07,647
Halfway through
the 12-round fight

1934
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:11,651
in Las Vegas, now they're even: Hope
bleeding from above the left eye.

1935
01:48:11,684 --> 01:48:15,121
Escobar bleeding
from above the right.

1936
01:48:21,627 --> 01:48:23,629
Hope mounting
more and more offense now.

1937
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:27,600
And now he fires back
with a big right hand.

1938
01:48:30,436 --> 01:48:32,438
- We got this.
- And they're working hard

1939
01:48:32,472 --> 01:48:35,175
to keep that right eye together
for Escobar, in his corner.

1940
01:48:35,208 --> 01:48:37,410
They're working just as hard

1941
01:48:37,443 --> 01:48:39,645
to keep Billy Hope's left eye
in the fight.

1942
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:44,050
Hard right hand!

1943
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:45,651
Get off the rope!

1944
01:48:45,685 --> 01:48:47,387
Hope trapped in the corner.

1945
01:48:47,420 --> 01:48:49,655
Some of those shots
were blocked,

1946
01:48:49,689 --> 01:48:51,958
but it was another big rally
for Miguel Escobar.

1947
01:48:51,992 --> 01:48:54,094
Both men have been hurt

1948
01:48:54,127 --> 01:48:55,862
in this round.

1949
01:48:55,896 --> 01:48:59,832
Early rounds seemed to belong
to Miguel Escobar.

1950
01:48:59,866 --> 01:49:02,635
Middle rounds definitely
belonged to Billy Hope.

1951
01:49:02,668 --> 01:49:06,006
And now, as we come
to the 11th and 12th,

1952
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:11,177
it's a close fight on the table for
whichever fighter wants it most.

1953
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:12,913
- Shake it off, Billy!
- I'm fuckin' tired, man.

1954
01:49:12,946 --> 01:49:14,915
He's more tired than you are.

1955
01:49:14,948 --> 01:49:16,917
Two more, Billy... you just keep
doing what you're doing.

1956
01:49:16,950 --> 01:49:19,452
That fucker hits hard
as a motherfucker.

1957
01:49:19,485 --> 01:49:21,087
I need you to counter,
I need you to pivot.

1958
01:49:21,121 --> 01:49:23,623
I need you to stay
in the shell. Hear me?

1959
01:49:23,656 --> 01:49:25,458
You got to stay focused,
stay in this fight.

1960
01:49:25,491 --> 01:49:27,260
- Punch and move.
- You were his fuckin' trainer!

1961
01:49:27,293 --> 01:49:29,453
Why don't you tell me how to
fuckin' beat the guy, man?

1962
01:49:31,297 --> 01:49:33,266
You're ready for this.
You ain't tired.

1963
01:49:33,299 --> 01:49:35,535
You strong, you strong.
This is your time.

1964
01:49:35,568 --> 01:49:37,403
This is your moment, Billy.

1965
01:49:52,652 --> 01:49:54,687
Billy Hope! Billy Hope!

1966
01:49:56,122 --> 01:49:57,657
Now with two rounds to go,

1967
01:49:57,690 --> 01:50:00,927
let's see which man
can impose his will

1968
01:50:00,961 --> 01:50:02,228
in the championship rounds.

1969
01:50:02,262 --> 01:50:03,896
Come on, move, go!

1970
01:50:03,930 --> 01:50:06,899
Both men bleeding
badly from one eye.

1971
01:50:06,933 --> 01:50:08,734
Don't stay still! Let's go!

1972
01:50:08,768 --> 01:50:11,271
It has elevated
to a state of war.

1973
01:50:13,073 --> 01:50:15,241
That's right, Jim.

1974
01:50:20,146 --> 01:50:23,749
There are cuts everywhere,
there's blood everywhere.

1975
01:50:23,783 --> 01:50:26,286
Nothing to hold back now.

1976
01:50:26,319 --> 01:50:30,923
Underneath it all,
a subtext of hatred,

1977
01:50:30,957 --> 01:50:33,393
anger, revenge...

1978
01:50:33,426 --> 01:50:36,162
which may or may not
be relieved

1979
01:50:36,196 --> 01:50:38,731
by the violent combat

1980
01:50:38,764 --> 01:50:41,834
in which they
now immerse themselves.

1981
01:50:41,867 --> 01:50:43,769
That's it! That's what
I'm talking about! That's it!

1982
01:50:43,803 --> 01:50:45,905
At this point,
it's a war of attrition...

1983
01:50:45,938 --> 01:50:48,208
a fight to the finish.

1984
01:50:48,241 --> 01:50:52,078
Listen, now, your wife
can't save you now, bitch!

1985
01:50:52,112 --> 01:50:53,313
Yeah, she can't save you now.

1986
01:50:56,582 --> 01:50:58,251
What you doing?
Stick to the plan!

1987
01:50:58,284 --> 01:50:59,986
What are you trying to do?
Stick to the plan!

1988
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:01,821
Tony Weeks...

1989
01:51:01,854 --> 01:51:04,457
is caught between two monsters,

1990
01:51:04,490 --> 01:51:06,559
- as they fire away...
- What is he doing?

1991
01:51:06,592 --> 01:51:09,595
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

1992
01:51:09,629 --> 01:51:11,497
What did he do to my dad?

1993
01:51:11,531 --> 01:51:13,333
- What happened to him?
- It's okay, sweetie.

1994
01:51:13,366 --> 01:51:15,568
What's wrong with him?

1995
01:51:15,601 --> 01:51:17,703
Keep throwing them bars.
Just keep throwing them bars.

1996
01:51:17,737 --> 01:51:19,372
Come on, keep it
playing with his head.

1997
01:51:19,405 --> 01:51:21,007
Keep it playing...
Come on, Coach.

1998
01:51:22,708 --> 01:51:24,610
All right,
you're about to blow this.

1999
01:51:24,644 --> 01:51:27,047
You got to be calm,
you got to be calm.

2000
01:51:27,080 --> 01:51:28,481
Everybody else
is walking slow.

2001
01:51:28,514 --> 01:51:30,450
This world is yours,
this world is yours.

2002
01:51:30,483 --> 01:51:32,452
Your soul is here...
Give me a towel.

2003
01:51:32,485 --> 01:51:34,320
God is watching you.

2004
01:51:34,354 --> 01:51:36,156
Your wife is watching you.

2005
01:51:36,189 --> 01:51:38,158
I'm watching you.

2006
01:51:38,191 --> 01:51:39,692
Your daughter's watching you.

2007
01:51:39,725 --> 01:51:41,661
Don't let this man
control you.

2008
01:51:41,694 --> 01:51:43,496
Don't let him
control you.

2009
01:51:43,529 --> 01:51:45,831
This is exceptional to me.

2010
01:51:45,865 --> 01:51:47,433
And part of a resurgent career,

2011
01:51:47,467 --> 01:51:49,135
as Hope is trying to come back

2012
01:51:49,169 --> 01:51:51,171
from life-damaging
circumstances,

2013
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:52,738
including, of course,

2014
01:51:52,772 --> 01:51:55,475
the unexpected death
of his wife Maureen.

2015
01:51:55,508 --> 01:51:56,842
Don't let him get
into your head.

2016
01:51:56,876 --> 01:51:58,711
Don't let him
take this from you.

2017
01:51:58,744 --> 01:52:01,147
You got one shot. Go southpaw.
Go southpaw on his ass.

2018
01:52:01,181 --> 01:52:03,049
You go in there
and you kick his ass!

2019
01:52:03,083 --> 01:52:04,817
You hear me? You show up,
you show him... you show him

2020
01:52:04,850 --> 01:52:06,619
- Seconds out!
- You're Billy the Great!

2021
01:52:06,652 --> 01:52:08,554
I want to see Billy the Great!

2022
01:52:08,588 --> 01:52:11,357
You got to go out there
and you... beat his ass!

2023
01:52:11,391 --> 01:52:12,558
Clap now.

2024
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:15,961
Already tonight,

2025
01:52:15,995 --> 01:52:18,030
a lot of expectations
have been amended

2026
01:52:18,064 --> 01:52:20,300
by the style of the fight,
by the competitiveness

2027
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:22,102
of the fight, and now...

2028
01:52:22,135 --> 01:52:24,670
by the unexpected circumstance

2029
01:52:24,704 --> 01:52:26,806
of us entering the 12th round

2030
01:52:26,839 --> 01:52:29,309
of a fight that
no ringside expert

2031
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:33,446
ever dreamed could
possibly go the distance.

2032
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:35,581
- Come on, Billy!
- I'm not sure

2033
01:52:35,615 --> 01:52:37,883
who's winning
this fight right now.

2034
01:52:37,917 --> 01:52:43,022
Escobar tasted both of those
big punches, and now he's not throwing,

2035
01:52:43,055 --> 01:52:45,091
as Hope lines him up
and tries to tee off.

2036
01:52:45,125 --> 01:52:48,027
Escobar is in
trouble, he's in bad trouble.

2037
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:52,332
Now Escobar comes back
with his own combination!

2038
01:52:52,365 --> 01:52:54,700
- Protect yourself!
- They take turns

2039
01:52:54,734 --> 01:52:58,604
trading combinations
and covering up

2040
01:52:58,638 --> 01:53:01,274
as the momentum shifts
back and forth

2041
01:53:01,307 --> 01:53:04,244
from one fighter to the other.

2042
01:53:04,277 --> 01:53:07,513
Tremendous uppercut by Hope!
And down goes Billy!

2043
01:53:07,547 --> 01:53:09,582
Ref, come on! Come on!

2044
01:53:09,615 --> 01:53:11,951
Tony Weeks
is gonna call it a low blow.

2045
01:53:11,984 --> 01:53:13,919
He's hurting him.
He's hurting him.

2046
01:53:13,953 --> 01:53:15,993
- It's okay, sweetie, it's okay.
- He's hurting him.

2047
01:53:17,823 --> 01:53:19,525
Come on, Billy...!
Come on!

2048
01:53:19,559 --> 01:53:21,261
One point, low blow.
Hear that?

2049
01:53:21,294 --> 01:53:23,796
- One point, low blow...
- There's no count,

2050
01:53:23,829 --> 01:53:27,267
and Escobar is losing a point
for the low blow.

2051
01:53:27,300 --> 01:53:28,968
- Let me know when you're ready.
- I'm good.

2052
01:53:29,001 --> 01:53:30,370
You ready?
Okay, here we go. Time in.

2053
01:53:30,403 --> 01:53:31,904
Let's go.

2054
01:53:31,937 --> 01:53:33,806
This could be critical

2055
01:53:33,839 --> 01:53:38,678
for what should be very
close scores at this moment.

2056
01:53:38,711 --> 01:53:40,946
We're about a minute away
from putting this

2057
01:53:40,980 --> 01:53:43,149
in the hands
of three judges at ringside.

2058
01:53:43,183 --> 01:53:45,050
Let's go!

2059
01:53:45,084 --> 01:53:48,588
Hope needs one last big shot.
Both men all-out.

2060
01:53:48,621 --> 01:53:52,658
Escobar comes back
with a hard right hand.

2061
01:53:56,362 --> 01:53:57,630
Come on, man.

2062
01:53:57,663 --> 01:53:59,565
Now we near the last minute

2063
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,068
of what has become
a spectacular seesaw fight.

2064
01:54:06,439 --> 01:54:07,907
Switch up! Switch up!

2065
01:54:07,940 --> 01:54:10,075
Now's the time, Billy!
Now's the time!

2066
01:54:38,338 --> 01:54:41,140
Now Hope switches feet
for a southpaw uppercut,

2067
01:54:41,173 --> 01:54:43,175
and down goes Escobar!

2068
01:54:43,209 --> 01:54:45,311
Yeah, Billy! Yeah! Yeah!

2069
01:54:45,345 --> 01:54:47,913
- Yeah!
- Southpaw! Yes!

2070
01:54:47,947 --> 01:54:50,950
Tremendous left-hand
shot by Billy Hope.

2071
01:54:50,983 --> 01:54:53,653
What an unbelievable
left uppercut

2072
01:54:53,686 --> 01:54:54,854
from the southpaw position.

2073
01:54:54,887 --> 01:54:56,789
...five, six...

2074
01:54:56,822 --> 01:54:59,859
Wow! Who would've
ever seen this coming?

2075
01:54:59,892 --> 01:55:01,594
- Come here. You good?
- I'm good.

2076
01:55:01,627 --> 01:55:03,563
You good? Okay, fight's over.
Fight's over. It's over!

2077
01:55:03,596 --> 01:55:06,366
Escobar is saved
by the bell,

2078
01:55:06,399 --> 01:55:08,167
just as he was getting up.

2079
01:55:08,200 --> 01:55:11,203
And Billy Hope finishes
the fight with a flourish.

2080
01:55:11,237 --> 01:55:14,707
We'll see what that does
to the scorecards

2081
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:17,243
in what could have been
a very close fight.

2082
01:55:17,277 --> 01:55:20,880
That may have been the
two-point round to get him over the hump.

2083
01:55:20,913 --> 01:55:22,882
Whether he won
the fight or not,

2084
01:55:22,915 --> 01:55:24,650
he'll have
tremendous satisfaction

2085
01:55:24,684 --> 01:55:28,254
from having knocked
Miguel Escobar down.

2086
01:55:28,288 --> 01:55:31,223
Now let's go to ring announcer
Jimmy Lennon Jr.

2087
01:55:31,257 --> 01:55:34,327
To find out who's the winner.

2088
01:55:34,360 --> 01:55:36,862
Ladies and gentlemen,

2089
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:39,299
after 12 rounds of action,

2090
01:55:39,332 --> 01:55:41,501
we have a split decision.

2091
01:55:43,769 --> 01:55:46,205
Judge at ringside, Casey Borne,

2092
01:55:46,238 --> 01:55:49,775
scores the bout 115 to 113

2093
01:55:49,809 --> 01:55:53,846
for Miguel Escobar.

2094
01:55:53,879 --> 01:55:57,082
- No.
- Judge Raoul Fromes sees it...

2095
01:55:58,651 --> 01:56:01,987
...115 to 114

2096
01:56:02,021 --> 01:56:04,056
for Billy Hope.

2097
01:56:08,060 --> 01:56:11,030
And Judge Ricky Quiles
scores the bout

2098
01:56:11,063 --> 01:56:14,567
116 to 112...

2099
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:18,170
in favor of the winner...

2100
01:56:18,203 --> 01:56:19,805
and the new...

2101
01:56:19,839 --> 01:56:22,942
WBC Light Heavyweight Champion

2102
01:56:22,975 --> 01:56:25,478
- of the World, Billy...
- He did it!

2103
01:56:25,511 --> 01:56:27,246
He did it! He did it!
He did it!

2104
01:56:27,279 --> 01:56:29,549
Hope...!

2105
01:56:31,584 --> 01:56:33,486
Hope is back!

2106
01:56:33,519 --> 01:56:35,488
Hope is on top again!

2107
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:37,723
Billy Hope has regained

2108
01:56:37,757 --> 01:56:39,291
the Light Heavyweight
Championship of the World.

2109
01:56:39,325 --> 01:56:42,762
Yes, Jim, we still have Hope.

2110
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:44,597
- Yes!
- Yes, Dad!

2111
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:46,470
What a spectacular
story here in Vegas tonight.

2112
01:56:59,679 --> 01:57:01,246
No problem.
No problem.

2113
01:57:08,788 --> 01:57:10,155
We did it, baby.

2114
01:57:12,057 --> 01:57:14,660
What an amazing
moment of redemption

2115
01:57:14,694 --> 01:57:16,562
for Billy Hope.

2116
01:57:16,596 --> 01:57:18,330
Hey, baby...

2117
01:57:20,032 --> 01:57:22,535
I'm ready.
Yeah, I'm ready.

2118
01:57:22,568 --> 01:57:23,769
I'm ready.

2119
01:57:26,406 --> 01:57:28,040
I'm ready. I'm ready.

2120
01:57:29,842 --> 01:57:32,244
Hey, T. Come here.

2121
01:57:32,277 --> 01:57:33,779
What?

2122
01:57:33,813 --> 01:57:36,048
- It's your belt.
- It's for you, man.

2123
01:57:36,081 --> 01:57:37,550
No, no, no.
That's-that's yours.

2124
01:57:37,583 --> 01:57:38,818
Hey, hey, it's
too heavy, man!

2125
01:57:38,851 --> 01:57:40,319
No, no. No, no... no, no.

2126
01:57:43,723 --> 01:57:45,458
Everybody, great work.

2127
01:57:45,491 --> 01:57:47,026
Very nice. Thank you.

2128
01:57:47,059 --> 01:57:48,861
You got to hang that up
on the wall in the gym.

2129
01:57:48,894 --> 01:57:51,096
- Up there for the kids.
- Yeah!

2130
01:57:51,130 --> 01:57:53,332
Daddy!
Daddy! Daddy!

2131
01:57:53,365 --> 01:57:54,500
Baby...

2132
01:57:58,404 --> 01:58:03,108
Hey. Hey. Are you okay?

2133
01:58:03,142 --> 01:58:05,144
Huh? Hmm?

2134
01:58:05,177 --> 01:58:07,212
Yeah.

2135
01:58:09,615 --> 01:58:11,584
- Hmm?
- I was scared for you.

2136
01:58:11,617 --> 01:58:13,753
- Aw.
- It was so scary.

2137
01:58:13,786 --> 01:58:17,657
Aw, baby,
you're so brave.

2138
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:19,258
You guys take care
of each other.

2139
01:58:23,395 --> 01:58:25,297
I love you, Daddy.

2140
01:58:26,799 --> 01:58:29,268
Yeah, baby.

2141
01:58:32,104 --> 01:58:35,875
Your mother would be
so proud of you.

2142
01:58:41,914 --> 01:58:44,717
Let's just go home, okay?

2143
01:58:47,653 --> 01:58:49,622
Just go home, okay?

2144
01:58:49,655 --> 01:58:51,090
Let's go home.

2145
01:58:51,123 --> 01:58:54,193
Let's go home.

2146
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:59,064
I was so worried for you.

2147
01:58:59,098 --> 01:59:00,365
Mm.

2148
01:59:02,635 --> 01:59:04,637
Come here.

2149
01:59:19,485 --> 01:59:20,586
Back up. Back up.

2150
01:59:20,620 --> 01:59:22,087
Give the man some room.

2151
01:59:22,121 --> 01:59:23,656
Back up.

2152
01:59:24,305 --> 02:00:24,247
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
