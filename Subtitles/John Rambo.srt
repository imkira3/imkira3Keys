<i>...something they had never seen,
which liberated a yellow,</i>

3
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:33,617
<i>very pungent and acrid vapor.</i>

4
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,494
<i>The actions of the hard-line military regime</i>

5
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,580
<i>are the cause of increasing
international concern.</i>

6
00:00:38,664 --> 00:00:40,624
<i>The regime crushes all dissent.</i>

7
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:43,669
<i>Ethnic groups are being oppressed
in the east of the country,</i>

8
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,462
<i>and foreign journalists are rarely...</i>

9
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,507
<i>...claim tonight that some form
of chemical weapon</i>

10
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,676
<i>has been used in Burma by military rulers...</i>

11
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,427
<i>...has led to the national uprising.</i>

12
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:54,179
<i>Thousands took to the streets
and thousands were killed...</i>

13
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:57,432
<i>In Burma, many peaceful protesting monks
have been killed,</i>

14
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,102
<i>some burned alive, and others drowned.</i>

15
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>Foreign journalists
have been shot and killed.</i>

16
00:01:02,229 --> 00:01:04,189
<i>As thousands of villages
have been destroyed,</i>

17
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:06,233
<i>rape and torture are a daily occurrence.</i>

18
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,610
<i>In Burma, there are more land mines
than anywhere in the world.</i>

19
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:10,821
<i>Young men are beaten
and forced into the army,</i>

20
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,864
<i>many as young as 12 years old.</i>

21
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:15,075
<i>Beheadings and mutilations
are commonplace.</i>

22
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,995
<i>The Karen people, comprised mostly
of poor Christian farmers,</i>

23
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,246
<i>have been singled out for extermination.</i>

24
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:20,539
<i>The ruling military government</i>

25
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,792
<i>wants the abundant natural resources
on Karen land.</i>

26
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,628
<i>The bloody Burmese military campaign
against the Karen people</i>

27
00:01:26,712 --> 00:01:29,131
<i>has been going on for almost 60 years,</i>

28
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,467
<i>the longest running civil war in the world.</i>

29
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,629
<i>Two snake that you see,
they are Siamese cobra or common cobra.</i>

30
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:24,593
<i>He is not king cobra and not spitting cobra.</i>

31
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,731
Hey! Hey!

32
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:48,950
Fuck off, okay?

33
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,293
<i>They still have fang and still have poison.</i>

34
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,380
<i>He is small, dangerous, number one.</i>

35
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:05,675
<i>King cobra number two.</i>

36
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,887
<i>And now spitting cobra.</i>

37
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,556
<i>He can spit poison to your eye.</i>

38
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,477
<i>One color.</i>

39
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:20,357
<i>He's very, very dangerous.
Number one in Thailand.</i>

40
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,484
<i>Careful, my friend.</i>

41
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,862
Looks like dangerous work.

42
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,201
I'm Michael Burnett.
Do you have some time to talk?

43
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,828
Won't take long, I promise.

44
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,247
I was told it might be possible
to rent your boat.

45
00:07:36,331 --> 00:07:37,332
We'd like to do that.

46
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,918
Is that possible? We need to get upriver.

47
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,337
- Where you going?
-lnto Burma.

48
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,881
Burma's a war zone.

49
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:49,260
Well, that's what people call it,
but it's more like genocide than war.

50
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:55,058
Anyway, this will be my fifth trip in,
so we are aware of all the risks.

51
00:07:58,228 --> 00:07:59,688
I don't go that far north.

52
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,315
Let me explain our situation.

53
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:06,403
Our church is part of a Pan-Asian ministry
located in Colorado,

54
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,531
and we're all volunteers
who around this time of year

55
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:13,243
bring in medical supplies,
medical attention,

56
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,287
prayer books and support
for the Karen tribes people.

57
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,874
People say
you know the river better than anyone.

58
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:20,959
Well, they lied.

59
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,837
S0, what I'm asking is that
we compensate you

60
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,297
for a few hours of your time.

61
00:08:26,381 --> 00:08:28,383
It will help change people's lives.

62
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:34,681
- Are you bringing in any weapons?
- Of course not.

63
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,891
You're not changing anything.

64
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,769
Well...

65
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,649
It's thinking like that
that keeps the world the way it is.

66
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,067
Fuck the world.

67
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,822
- Let's go.
- Why?

68
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,991
He's not interested. Let's just go.

69
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:54,409
- Let me try.
- No, Sarah...

70
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,910
No, didn't you say
it was the only way up there?

71
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,787
- I know I did...
- All right, then what do we have to lose?

72
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,164
- I talked to the man...
- Just let me try, Michael.

73
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,415
- Sarah...
- Please.

74
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,431
Hello?

75
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,434
I'm Sarah Miller.

76
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:23,021
I hope you don't mind me
coming back here.

77
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,108
The man that you were talking to...

78
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:28,860
I wasn't talking to anybody.

79
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:32,697
All right.

80
00:09:32,781 --> 00:09:34,240
The man that was talking to you

81
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,619
asked if we could hire you
to take us up the river.

82
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,789
- You said no. Why?
- Can't help you out.

83
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,877
Well, if you have good reasons,
would you mind ifl heard them?

84
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,799
G0 home.

85
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,800
You shouldn't be in here.

86
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:00,178
Would you reconsider?

87
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,850
Look, I don't know anything about you,

88
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:09,520
and it seems like you don't care to know
anything about us.

89
00:12:09,604 --> 00:12:10,647
Sarah.

90
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,983
But you live so close
to what's going on over here.

91
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,987
I mean, doesn't it bother you at all?

92
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,447
It's not my business.

93
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,241
Sarah, we should go.

94
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:33,127
Do you believe that people are put here
to die for no reason?

95
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,717
Or believe in giving time to something
other than yourself?

96
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,386
I mean, do you believe in anything?

97
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,561
You really ought to go.

98
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:01,906
The man doesn't care.
We'll figure something out.

99
00:15:33,808 --> 00:15:35,059
Why'd you come back?

100
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:38,688
Waiting for you.

101
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,067
- I told you before, I can't help you.
- Why?

102
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:45,820
I don't want to.

103
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,744
- Where are your friends?
- At the hotel.

104
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,455
I can take care of myself.

105
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,832
- Is that so?
- Yes.

106
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:00,501
- I know you don't like us.
- I never said that.

107
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,752
Well, it looks that way.

108
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,715
We need to go and help these people.

109
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,300
Who are you helping?

110
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,636
Them or you?

111
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,555
- Does it matter?
- Yeah, it matters.

112
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,182
Them.

113
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:16,684
There's nothing missing
in our lives back home.

114
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,019
We're here to make a difference.

115
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,605
We believe all lives are special.

116
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,690
- Some lives, some, no.
- Really?

117
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:25,026
If everyone thought like you,
nothing would ever change.

118
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,110
Nothing does change.

119
00:16:26,194 --> 00:16:28,446
Of course it does. Nothing stays the same.

120
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,406
Live your life, 'cause you got a good one.

121
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,949
It's what I'm trying to do.

122
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,118
No, what you're trying to do
is change what is.

123
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:36,120
- And what is?
- That we're like animals.

124
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:40,875
It's in the blood. It's natural.

125
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:43,336
Peace, that's an accident.

126
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,588
It's what is.

127
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:51,302
When you're pushed,
killing is as easy as breathing.

128
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:56,807
Then the killing stops in one place
and it starts in another,

129
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:00,311
but that's okay
'cause you're killing for your country.

130
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:04,899
But it ain't your country who's asking.
It's a few men up top who want it.

131
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:08,945
Old men start it, young men fight it.

132
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:12,740
Nobody wins, everybody in the middle dies.

133
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,910
And nobody tells the truth.

134
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,372
God's gonna make all that go away?

135
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,974
Don't waste your life. I did.

136
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:43,938
G0 home.

137
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,442
Really. Go home.

138
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:09,171
- You care.
- What?

139
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:11,674
You care.

140
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:17,138
Because if you didn't,
you would have taken us there,

141
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,391
taken the money and be done with it.

142
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,811
But you didn't do that.

143
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:38,367
Maybe...

144
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,745
Maybe you've lost your faith in people,

145
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:44,498
but you must still be faithful to something.

146
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:51,130
Believe me, I'm scared.

147
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:55,926
And I love my life
and I don't want to lose it.

148
00:18:58,346 --> 00:19:03,100
But trying to save a life
isn't wasting your life, is it?

149
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:09,440
Will you help us?

150
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,701
All right.

151
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,122
Thank you.

152
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,393
As bad as these people are,
they will eventually lose.

153
00:19:45,893 --> 00:19:48,688
They can't keep it up against a united front.
They can't.

154
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,316
I mean, time alone will tell,
but in the meantime,

155
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,026
we just have to help hold it together.

156
00:19:54,819 --> 00:19:56,570
I mean, just the other day, I read...

157
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:57,822
Excuse me.

158
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,907
Sarah, where are you going?

159
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,451
To talk to him.

160
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,412
Well, he probably wants his privacy.

161
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:05,913
Michael, you shouldn't ignore him.

162
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,082
- He's helping us.
- He's been paid.

163
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,917
He didn't take anything.

164
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:21,721
Thank you, again, for doing this.
Really. From all of us.

165
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,020
It's like the same view goes on forever.

166
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,939
It's so empty out here.

167
00:20:33,107 --> 00:20:34,400
It just looks that way.

168
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,946
You know, you never told us your name.

169
00:20:40,281 --> 00:20:41,615
- John.
- John.

170
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,411
- Lived here a long time?
- Long time.

171
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,792
- Where you from?
- Bowie, Arizona. Small place.

172
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,795
What'd you do there?

173
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:58,632
Worked horses, mainly.

174
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:02,303
- Why'd you leave?
- I got drafted in Nam.

175
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:08,476
- Long time ago.
- Long time ago. Lot of years.

176
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,227
And you just stayed?

177
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,481
It's complicated.

178
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:18,027
- You have family back home?
- Father maybe. I don't know.

179
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,074
Aren't you curious to see
how things might've changed back home?

180
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,329
Got to have a reason for that.

181
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:42,676
- What do you do stateside?
- I teach. Sixth grade.

182
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,597
What?

183
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,599
Now I know why you ask
so many questions.

184
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:00,861
- Any idea how much longer?
- Yeah, just a few more hours.

185
00:22:03,197 --> 00:22:04,824
Maybe we should give the man his space.

186
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,538
We should go over the schedule, okay?

187
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,581
Okay.

188
00:22:19,547 --> 00:22:22,883
We're engaged. He's a good man.

189
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:25,386
That's good.

190
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,225
I know you think you live alone out here,
but there's always something pushing you.

191
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,870
- What is it? Who are they?
- Burmese pirates.

192
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,414
Tell everyone to stay down,
don't make a sound.

193
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,460
- Who are they?
-lt's all right, it's all right.

194
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,669
- Just keep...
- Don't talk!

195
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,003
- Any more of them?
- Maybe.

196
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,463
What do you wanna do?

197
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,840
We should keep going.
We made a commitment.

198
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,509
- What do you wanna do?
- We're a group here.

199
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:29,718
If they wanna vote...

200
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,223
- Sit down!
- If it's money they want...

201
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,354
Nobody talks. Heads down.

202
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,990
Keep your heads down
and nobody look them in the eye,

203
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:52,074
or they'll kill you.

204
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:44,728
No!

205
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,487
What did you do?

206
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,031
We came here to help stop the killing!

207
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,407
Who are you to...

208
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,785
- Who are you?
- Let him go!

209
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:03,705
They would've raped her 50 times,
and cut your heads off.

210
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,791
We're going back!

211
00:27:10,838 --> 00:27:13,423
No. No, we shouldn't go back.

212
00:27:13,507 --> 00:27:15,467
- What are you doing?
- Don't take us back.

213
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:17,261
- Look what just happened!
- We got through it.

214
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:20,222
- We'll come back next year.
- We are so close.

215
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:25,269
Michael, this was your idea.
We made a commitment.

216
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,273
I know you don't believe
in what we're doing,

217
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,859
but it's our life, our choice.

218
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:38,949
Please. Please, John.

219
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,576
Please.

220
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,207
You're not going to change anything.

221
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,428
Go sit down.

222
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,605
It's all right.

223
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,988
We'll be taking the overland route
on the way back,

224
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,615
so there's no need to wait around.

225
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,952
I have to report this.

226
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:09,206
I know you think what you did was right,
but taking a life is never right.

227
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,975
I don't know what to say.

228
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,398
Then you shouldn't say anything,
should you?

229
00:32:21,398 --> 00:32:22,482
Hey.

230
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:50,844
<i>What did you do?</i>

231
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,462
Good, good.

232
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,097
Through his spirit in your inner being.

233
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,646
So Christ may dwell
in your hearts with faith.

234
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,194
And I pray...

235
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:53,573
...you may have the power together...

236
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,912
Let me see if I can fix
this little problem, okay?

237
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,413
Okay.

238
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,761
Hey, you.

239
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,763
Hand me one of those bandages?

240
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:19,558
Okay.

241
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:21,142
Thank you.

242
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,270
Okay.

243
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:41,746
- Get out of here!
- What about them?

244
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,956
Go on! Take them!

245
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,687
<i>Maybe you've lost your faith in people,</i>

246
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,357
<i>but you must still be faithful to something.</i>

247
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,569
<i>Still care about something.</i>

248
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,263
<i>Company leader calling Raven.
Come on, Raven.</i>

249
00:39:52,432 --> 00:39:54,893
<i>What am I? You made me this way.</i>

250
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,853
<i>A full-blooded combat soldier.</i>

251
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,521
<i>You just don't turn it off.</i>

252
00:39:58,605 --> 00:39:59,647
<i>Talk to me, Johnny.</i>

253
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,024
<i>You just don't turn it offl</i>

254
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:03,318
<i>-/t's over.</i>
- Nothing is over!

255
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,322
<i>When are you gonna come full circle?</i>

256
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:09,949
<i>I know the reasons you're here, John.</i>

257
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:14,037
<i>Aren't you curious to see
how things might've changed back home?</i>

258
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,789
<i>You've done enough damage.</i>

259
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,209
<i>You're always going to be
tearing away at yourself</i>

260
00:40:20,293 --> 00:40:22,211
<i>until you come to terms with what you are.</i>

261
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,838
<i>Until you come full circle.</i>

262
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,882
<i>So you're just going to stay here forever?</i>

263
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:28,301
- John!
- I wanna go home!

264
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:29,510
John Rambo!

265
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,055
John?

266
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,432
John Rambo?

267
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,321
My name is Arthur Marsh,

268
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,367
pastor of the Christ Church of Colorado.

269
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,245
I need to talk with you. It's very important.

270
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,331
I wouldn't come here like this if it wasn't.

271
00:41:02,627 --> 00:41:05,672
The morning of the day the group left,

272
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:09,926
Michael Burnett notified me
that they were traveling from this location.

273
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:16,182
- What happened?
- No one knows exactly.

274
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:20,395
They were supposed to return 10 days ago,
but they never came back.

275
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,439
I requested help from the embassy,
but they can't help.

276
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:26,192
Not in Burma, and not in time.

277
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:27,944
How do you know they're alive?

278
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:31,447
Because we've been in contact
with the Karen freedom fighters

279
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,950
who say they think they know
where they were taken.

280
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:39,205
And I was given the name of an ex-military
American local from the embassy

281
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,667
who put me in touch with men
who say they have experience

282
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,210
in this part of the world.

283
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:45,420
Mercenaries.

284
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,296
Yes.

285
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:50,174
I don't have any other choice.

286
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:54,595
You know the exact spot.
We need you to take these men

287
00:41:56,097 --> 00:41:57,348
to where you let our people off.

288
00:41:57,765 --> 00:41:58,891
When are they ready to leave?

289
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:01,811
When you are.

290
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,022
Aren't you gonna say something?

291
00:42:06,274 --> 00:42:07,859
- I don't understand.
- You should.

292
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,611
You mean a prayer?

293
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:12,613
Not for me, for them.

294
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,699
Yes.

295
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,371
Lord,

296
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:24,375
make me your instrument of peace.

297
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,839
Where there is hatred, let me bring love.

298
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,718
Where there is injury, pardon.

299
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:39,057
<i>Where there is doubt, faith.</i>

300
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:44,270
<i>Where there is despair, hope.</i>

301
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,774
<i>Where there is darkness, light.</i>

302
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,612
<i>Where there is sadness, joy.</i>

303
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:58,367
<i>Grant that I may not seek to be consoled
as to console,</i>

304
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,623
<i>to be understood as to understand,</i>

305
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:07,502
<i>to be loved as to love,</i>

306
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:11,422
<i>for it is in giving that we receive.</i>

307
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:17,303
<i>It is in dying that we awake to eternal life.</i>

308
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,412
Look at this fucking place.
Only a fucking ape would live here.

309
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,706
What the fuck am I doing here?

310
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,002
Hey, knock that shit off.

311
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,421
En-Joo don't like the arts.

312
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,048
- En-Joo don't like shit.
- I like your sister, Diaz.

313
00:44:36,424 --> 00:44:37,884
She got a thing for retards.

314
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,553
So what did the Reverend say to you?

315
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,472
Some shit about part of his flock
going missing.

316
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,807
I said to him, "Look, mate.

317
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:47,894
"That's what you get when you go
trespassing into fucking Burma.

318
00:44:47,977 --> 00:44:50,730
"That's what you get when you go sniffing
around other people's garbage."

319
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,566
You know, those generals in there
are making a lot of money.

320
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,236
Millions cranking out meth more
than any other place on the fucking planet.

321
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,529
Bullshit.

322
00:44:58,613 --> 00:45:00,281
- Millions, moron.
- Hell, yeah, man.

323
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,491
How do you think they pay
for that shit army?

324
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,869
Fucking generals,
biggest junkies of all of them.

325
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,412
It's noble, Lewis.

326
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,623
You what?

327
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:10,917
Those people going in there
with no weapons,

328
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:14,503
just books and meds. It's noble.

329
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:15,838
Oi, School Boy.

330
00:45:16,339 --> 00:45:18,007
You stick your noble nose
into other people's business,

331
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,426
you get fucked up or you get dead.

332
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:23,137
The only reason I'm doing this
is for an ex-wife and three kids.

333
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,388
And after this shit is over,

334
00:45:24,472 --> 00:45:26,849
you can shove that soldiering
right up your arse.

335
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,771
Oi, boat man. Come on, chop-chop!

336
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:34,649
The quicker we get there,
the quicker we get back.

337
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,822
Lousy God-squadders.

338
00:45:43,616 --> 00:45:47,078
They come over here spouting all that shit,

339
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:51,374
and they expect the whole world to work
like their fucking neighborhood.

340
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,583
Well, it doesn't.

341
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,128
So they send in the devil

342
00:45:58,047 --> 00:46:00,299
to do God's work. It's ironic, isn't it?

343
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,804
Am I boring you, mate?

344
00:46:06,639 --> 00:46:10,142
What, is it... ls it the trip?
Has it got you nervous?

345
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,229
'Cause, really, you should
appreciate the action.

346
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,480
You know what I mean?

347
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:16,482
Got to be better than looking
at the arse end of a snake.

348
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:21,487
Oh, dear.

349
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,657
You really are an uptight bastard,
aren't you?

350
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:31,330
You can drop the 1,000-yard stare.
I've seen it all before,

351
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:33,749
and I'm not impressed.

352
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,974
He's old school SAS.

353
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:53,060
They're first-rate soldiers,
but total egomaniacs.

354
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:57,440
Now, us SBS boys,
we're not so heavy-handed.

355
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,650
We like to use our brains.
You know what I mean?

356
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:05,031
They call me School Boy.

357
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:09,702
The name stuck with me
since sniper school.

358
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:14,290
And me mates won't stop calling me it
no matter how many people I shoot.

359
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:45,738
What do you want from us?

360
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,565
One man and a kid.
You gotta be fucking joking.

361
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:23,359
This all the rebels they put up?

362
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:24,527
I'm not liking it.

363
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,696
You're in a fucking jungle, puss nuts.
There's nothing to like.

364
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,281
How you doing?

365
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,992
My name is Myint. This is Tha.

366
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,786
- Is this it?
- Yes.

367
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:36,747
- What's up with the kid, man?
- He good tracker.

368
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,250
We don't need a tracker.
We need a fucking guide.

369
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:41,627
You know the exact location, right?

370
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,047
Ten kilometers west,
two north, six to a walk.

371
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:47,675
- How many soldiers?
- Hundred, maybe.

372
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,427
- Hundred?
- What'd he say?

373
00:48:49,510 --> 00:48:51,720
More new soldiers come tomorrow.

374
00:48:51,804 --> 00:48:54,473
Yeah, I know I'm just a white trash grunt,
but I can count.

375
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:55,724
Fuck fucking with 100 strong.

376
00:48:55,808 --> 00:48:57,935
All right, all right, all right.
Let's get this straight.

377
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:00,062
We don't engage anybody.

378
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:01,981
If we can extract these people, good.

379
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:05,109
But it's in, out, clean, or we fuck off.

380
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:07,445
Somebody wanna tell me
what the boat man's doing?

381
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:11,323
Hey, why ain't you waiting with the boat?

382
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:13,409
My men are staying with the boat.

383
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:14,910
You're the boat man.
You stay with the boat.

384
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,288
- I won't slow you down.
- Yeah, I know you won't.

385
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,540
- It's not a fucking nature hike.
- Believe that.

386
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,209
- He can hang with me at the back.
- Hey, hey, he stays here.

387
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:25,254
He's the boat man.
He stays with the fucking boat.

388
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,339
I want a white man on,
and not some fucking dink.

389
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,842
Now who's got explosives? Tombstone?

390
00:49:30,009 --> 00:49:32,470
- None.
- A pound of C-4 and primer.

391
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:34,638
I got a claymore.

392
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,516
All right, let's get on with it.

393
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,477
Come on, move, move.

394
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:20,768
- What the fuck is that?
- Called Tallboy bomb.

395
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,271
English drop in World War ll.

396
00:50:46,085 --> 00:50:48,379
Your people taken from here.

397
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,177
Man, I have seen some shit.

398
00:50:56,929 --> 00:50:58,847
Brother, I ain't never seen no shit like this.

399
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:01,600
Armies come. Kill everything.

400
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,270
Leave our dead here as warning.

401
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:10,818
He see enough.

402
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:13,529
Mine everywhere.

403
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:16,323
Watch where you walking.

404
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,795
- All right, let's move on.
- To what?

405
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,382
They even killed the fucking dogs.
Those people are dead.

406
00:51:33,591 --> 00:51:34,633
I'm with En-Joo.

407
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,469
We at least have to go
and have a look-see, check it out.

408
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,971
I'm with you. Let's check it out.

409
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,598
Check what? They're 100 strong.

410
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:42,308
Hey, we took the man's money.

411
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,435
Hey, hey, hey, hey-

412
00:51:44,727 --> 00:51:46,312
Just calm down, calm down.

413
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,107
We'll go there, and we'll see what's what.

414
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:54,695
But if anything's wrong,
anything at all, we'll leave.

415
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:56,572
All right?

416
00:51:58,532 --> 00:51:59,658
Yeah.

417
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,995
- All right.
- Good.

418
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:05,789
- Which way?
- This way.

419
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,754
Army! Go! Go!

420
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:36,737
I'm going to fire on them.

421
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,406
No! They don't make it back
from wherever the hell they came from,

422
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,699
man, they are on to us.

423
00:52:58,550 --> 00:52:59,885
What the fuck are they doing, man?

424
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:34,605
Who are you, boat man?
Where'd you learn to kill like that?

425
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:36,148
Let's move.

426
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,483
They're gonna come
hunting our asses down

427
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:38,859
when these guys don't show up.

428
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,360
I got people to live for, man.

429
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:42,321
We don't need this shit.
We're going back to the boat.

430
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:43,614
No, you're not.

431
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:46,784
What did you say?

432
00:54:49,036 --> 00:54:50,746
I don't give a fuck who you are.

433
00:54:50,829 --> 00:54:52,956
You say another word
and I swear on my kids' eyes

434
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,166
I'll kill you.

435
00:54:57,169 --> 00:54:58,253
Let's go.

436
00:54:58,545 --> 00:54:59,755
Whoa! Hey, hey!

437
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,845
You're not going anywhere.

438
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,855
And there isn't one of us
that doesn't want to be someplace else,

439
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:22,194
but this is what we do, who we are.

440
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,617
Live for nothing,

441
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,495
or die for something.

442
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:38,377
Your call.

443
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:47,344
Let's move.

444
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,515
Once School Boy's on the tower,
we got 15 minutes.

445
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:37,394
Set your watches to 1:45.
In, out, no waiting around for nobody.

446
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,438
We meet at the base of the tower.

447
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:40,689
- All set?
- Yeah.

448
00:56:40,772 --> 00:56:41,773
Set.

449
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:47,255
We're in.

450
00:57:55,389 --> 00:57:56,598
Go.

451
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,227
Go.

452
00:58:07,776 --> 00:58:08,819
Go.

453
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:17,911
Go.

454
00:59:52,631 --> 00:59:54,716
Don't talk. We're getting you out.

455
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,677
- Where's the girl?
- She's over there.

456
00:59:57,761 --> 00:59:59,846
You untie him. We'll be back for you.

457
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,748
Here.

458
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:31,586
There's two of them in the cage,
near the pigs.

459
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:32,671
- Get them.
- Got it.

460
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,284
- Come on, come on.
- Do you have Sarah?

461
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:08,827
Shut up, come on.

462
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,594
Please, no. No.

463
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,791
We can't find shit. One minute.

464
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,543
- There's one of them in there.
- Leave them.

465
01:05:21,626 --> 01:05:24,462
- You leave.
- What the fuck are they to you, boat man?

466
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:28,383
Run.

467
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,396
- Let's move.
- Where's the boat man?

468
01:05:41,479 --> 01:05:43,231
- And Sarah.
- Fifteen minutes. That's the deal.

469
01:05:43,314 --> 01:05:44,566
- We're leaving.
- Let's go!

470
01:05:44,649 --> 01:05:45,775
- Five more minutes.
- Bullshit.

471
01:05:45,859 --> 01:05:46,860
He knew the deal.

472
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:48,778
Hey, we came together,
we fucking leave together!

473
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:51,322
- Your life. Let's go.
- Not without her!

474
01:05:54,993 --> 01:05:56,995
God didn't save your life, we did.

475
01:05:57,245 --> 01:05:59,205
And if you risk your life one more time,

476
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,916
I will fucking take your life right here.

477
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:03,835
Now fucking get up.

478
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,296
Get up. Move!

479
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:07,881
This way.

480
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,034
It's all right. I got you.

481
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,286
We're getting out of here. Come on.

482
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:56,531
- Where are they?
- They took off that way into the garden.

483
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:57,615
They must know another way out.

484
01:07:57,699 --> 01:07:59,867
We got an hour till the daylight.
We got to backtrack.

485
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:00,952
This way.

486
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:13,024
- Pull up.
- What's wrong?

487
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,944
- Lift your foot.
- No, I don't wanna slow you down.

488
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,321
Lift your foot.

489
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,241
She's not making it like this.

490
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:23,910
I don't want you to get caught
because of me.

491
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:24,994
Let's move out.

492
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,514
I feel like all this is my fault.

493
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:46,557
It's everybody's fault.

494
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:48,142
I was trying to help.

495
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:49,852
I told you, it's what is.

496
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:51,979
I don't wanna believe that.

497
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:57,443
You think they found Michael?

498
01:09:57,819 --> 01:10:00,780
I mean, they probably have found him.

499
01:10:02,615 --> 01:10:04,075
Yeah, probably.

500
01:10:07,412 --> 01:10:08,746
Let's go.

501
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:25,990
My leg! My leg! Jesus! God damn it!

502
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:38,252
Shut up. Shut up.
We got you. We're getting out.

503
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:42,423
- His leg is shredded.
- Shit.

504
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:43,841
Where's the guide?

505
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,428
- The son of a bitch is gone!
- Fuck him. I know the coordinates.

506
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:48,888
We're not making it to the river with him.

507
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,765
Would you shut the fuck up?
Come on and tie his leg.

508
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:52,850
- Take off his boot.
- No!

509
01:11:53,518 --> 01:11:57,230
Leave his boot on.
Let us in here, we're doctors.

510
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,689
- I need a knife.
- Here, here, here.

511
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,652
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

512
01:12:03,236 --> 01:12:05,655
- Is he gonna make it?
- I don't know. Make a stretcher.

513
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:06,823
Spread out!

514
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:32,557
Take the point.

515
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:46,904
Hear that?

516
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,782
They're tracking us.

517
01:12:50,533 --> 01:12:52,159
They're on our scent.

518
01:12:53,578 --> 01:12:55,454
- Turn around.
- What are you doing?

519
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,456
- Just move. Turn. Turn.
- All right.

520
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,420
I want you two to head
southeast to the river.

521
01:13:02,503 --> 01:13:03,713
And the boat will be waiting.

522
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:07,842
If it's not there, you keep following
the shoreline till I find you.

523
01:13:07,925 --> 01:13:09,468
What about you?

524
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,888
I'll be all right. Give me that claymore.

525
01:13:14,265 --> 01:13:16,350
- Now fire off a shot.
- What?

526
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,019
Fire off a shot!

527
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,448
You're gonna make it.

528
01:13:31,282 --> 01:13:32,950
G0! G0!

529
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:36,078
- Come on! Come on!
- Move! Move it!

530
01:13:36,162 --> 01:13:37,788
- Let's g0!
-| QOt you. I got you;

531
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,040
Grab it! Grab it!

532
01:16:24,914 --> 01:16:26,457
- I can't.
- Get up!

533
01:16:26,540 --> 01:16:27,541
I can't.

534
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:30,294
Come on. Come on.

535
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,986
- Down, down, down.
- Wait. What is it? What? What?

536
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,743
Son of a bitch. Look.

537
01:17:02,827 --> 01:17:04,161
What is it?

538
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:09,959
Oh, God!

539
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,887
God damn.

540
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:58,090
You gutless fuck! You fucking pussy!

541
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:05,598
Motherfucker.

542
01:18:06,891 --> 01:18:08,684
Gutless fuck!

543
01:18:08,767 --> 01:18:11,187
Come and have a go at me,
you lady-boy cunt!

544
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:13,856
Come on, you... Fucking have a go at me!

545
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,650
Fuck... You fucking... Do something...

546
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:19,778
Fucking Jesus!

547
01:18:20,237 --> 01:18:21,488
Oh, God.

548
01:18:48,933 --> 01:18:50,476
What do we do?

549
01:18:51,602 --> 01:18:53,270
Nothing we can do.

550
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,239
Oh, God.

551
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,643
No.

552
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,294
The Karen rebels.

553
01:24:56,341 --> 01:24:57,593
Michael?

554
01:25:00,721 --> 01:25:01,972
Michael?

555
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:06,476
Michael? Michael?

556
01:25:09,980 --> 01:25:11,189
Michael?

557
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:25,078
Michael! Michael!

558
01:25:33,253 --> 01:25:35,380
Michael! Michael!

559
01:25:40,677 --> 01:25:41,887
Michael!

560
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:44,222
Michael!

561
01:25:52,522 --> 01:25:54,983
It's okay. It's okay.

562
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,572
- Go help them, okay?
- Okay.

563
01:26:01,305 --> 01:27:01,822
