00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:51,818
<i>You think you know the truth
about him? You know nothing.</i>

3
00:00:55,823 --> 00:00:59,394
<i>His father was Zeus. The Zeus.</i>

4
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:02,094
<i>King of the gods.</i>

5
00:01:04,399 --> 00:01:09,401
<i>His mother, Alcmene, a mortal woman.</i>

6
00:01:10,538 --> 00:01:13,007
<i>Together, they had a boy.</i>

7
00:01:13,107 --> 00:01:17,609
<i>Half human, half god.</i>

8
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:24,785
<i>But Zeus' queen, Hera, saw this
bastard child as an insult,</i>

9
00:01:24,885 --> 00:01:28,356
<i>a living reminder of her
husband's infidelity.</i>

10
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:33,461
<i>Alcmene named the boy Hercules,
which means "glory of Hera,"</i>

11
00:01:33,561 --> 00:01:37,265
<i>but this failed to
appease the goddess.</i>

12
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,666
<i>She wanted him dead.</i>

13
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:02,588
<i>Luckily, he took after his father.</i>

14
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:08,596
<i>Once he reached manhood, the gods
commanded him to perform Twelve Labors,</i>

15
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:13,635
<i>twelve dangerous missions. If he
completed them all and survived,</i>

16
00:02:13,735 --> 00:02:17,803
<i>Hera agreed to finally
let him live in peace.</i>

17
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:39,091
<i>He fought the Lernean Hydra!</i>

18
00:02:51,506 --> 00:02:55,207
<i>He battled the Erymanthean Boar!</i>

19
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:11,259
<i>But his greatest Labor
was the Nemean Lion.</i>

20
00:03:16,097 --> 00:03:19,465
<i>This was no ordinary beast.</i>

21
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:25,938
<i>It had a hide so tough,
no weapon could penetrate it.</i>

22
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:42,521
<i>But even this monster was no
match for the son of Zeus.</i>

23
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:48,963
- What a load of crap!
- Every word is true.

24
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:57,372
You know what I think? This friend
of yours doesn't even exist.

25
00:03:57,872 --> 00:04:03,678
Laugh all you want. He's coming. And
be warned, Gryza, he despises pirates.

26
00:04:03,778 --> 00:04:06,013
Macedonia has been good to us.

27
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:08,983
Plenty of villages
ripe for pillaging.

28
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:12,484
We are here to stay. Finish him.

29
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,692
The more you struggle,
the faster you drop.

30
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:22,327
Indeed, your fleet is strong. I...

31
00:04:25,365 --> 00:04:29,971
Yet, as I was about to explain
before I was so rudely interrupted,

32
00:04:30,071 --> 00:04:34,842
the Nemean Lion was strong, too.
Yet, he still destroyed it.

33
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:39,678
And not with a sword or
a spear or arrows. No!

34
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:45,751
I did it with my bare hands!

35
00:04:48,422 --> 00:04:50,389
Or so they say.

36
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:55,997
- Hercules.
- Is this all the men you have?

37
00:04:56,097 --> 00:04:59,233
There's 40 of us. One of you.

38
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:03,471
The king of this land has offered
me gold to dispose of you.

39
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:08,707
So leave, or die.
I get paid either way.

40
00:05:08,843 --> 00:05:11,379
Make him bleed.

41
00:05:17,952 --> 00:05:20,020
Five men with a single blow.

42
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,957
Still think you can
destroy the son of Zeus?

43
00:05:23,057 --> 00:05:25,193
Bring me his head!

44
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,131
Seems they need more
convincing, Autolycus.

45
00:05:30,231 --> 00:05:32,364
That's why we're here.

46
00:05:33,634 --> 00:05:35,768
Atalanta.

47
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:40,439
Amphiaraus.

48
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,145
May Zeus forgive you.

49
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:45,945
Tydeus?

50
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,037
Die, Hercules!

51
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,910
Ah, good man.

52
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:31,992
Hurry! Hurry! Uncle!

53
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:37,229
Uncle, hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

54
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:41,135
Any longer, Uncle...

55
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:45,671
And the girls would finally
be safe from your attentions.

56
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,443
The rest of you may go.

57
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,912
But not you.

58
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,528
Thirteen,

59
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:10,398
14, 15, 16,

60
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:14,735
- 17, 18, 19, 20.
- That was fun.

61
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:18,172
Twenty pirates at two
gold pieces a head,

62
00:07:18,272 --> 00:07:20,875
minus the headless ones. Let's see.

63
00:07:20,975 --> 00:07:22,109
Not a bad night.

64
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:25,712
You see how the pirates ran?
My story softened their resolve.

65
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,015
Their resolve must be broken, Iolaus.

66
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,919
When you spread the legend of
Hercules, make it bigger, scarier.

67
00:07:32,019 --> 00:07:35,289
The more they believe Hercules
is truly the son of Zeus,

68
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,658
the less likely they are to fight.

69
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:39,758
Oh!

70
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:42,494
Aye.

71
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,765
- Amphiaraus?
- Mmm?

72
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,432
Care to join us here on Earth?

73
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:57,476
A lion and a crow in strange alliance,
fighting across a sea of corpses.

74
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:06,821
If you're going to use those herbs,
Amphiaraus, at least share.

75
00:08:06,921 --> 00:08:08,122
Huh?

76
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:17,798
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!

77
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,799
Fight it!

78
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,036
Keep practicing, boys!

79
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,840
So who's next? You? You?

80
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,539
Ah!

81
00:08:29,243 --> 00:08:30,611
That's a pretty sight.

82
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:33,046
One more payday, Autolycus,
that's all we need.

83
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:36,250
Then we get to live like
the kings we've served.

84
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,251
Or live simply.

85
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:42,989
You still dreaming
of barbarian lands?

86
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,759
Beyond the Aegean.
At the shores of the Black Sea.

87
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,563
That is where I will live out the
rest of my days in solitude.

88
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,882
- Boring, if you ask me.
- Maybe so, Autolycus.

89
00:08:52,982 --> 00:08:57,537
But I'll never find peace unless
I move as far away as possible.

90
00:08:58,139 --> 00:09:02,543
What of Tydeus? Without you to temper
his rage, I fear what he may become.

91
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:07,615
Tydeus will go with me. Civilization
has become too civilized for us.

92
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,582
Uncle!

93
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:13,485
Join us. The girls are
eager to welcome you.

94
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:24,529
See? I told you I knew Hercules.

95
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,602
- Are you his servant?
- I'm his nephew.

96
00:09:28,702 --> 00:09:31,338
- Are you, really?
- I tell of Hercules' Twelve Labors,

97
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:34,141
like the Nemean Lion,
the Apples of the Hesperides,

98
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:38,478
the Belt of Hippolyta with its buxom
naked Amazons and exciting bondage.

99
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:42,015
- I immortalize him...
- He talks, while the rest of us fight.

100
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:45,119
It is a wonder you share the
same blood as Hercules.

101
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,189
Have fun.

102
00:09:48,289 --> 00:09:50,489
- Ladies.
- Oh...

103
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:13,314
- What do you want with Hercules?
- My words are for him, not you.

104
00:10:13,414 --> 00:10:16,515
Atalanta, it's all right.

105
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:26,594
- You certainly are a hard man to find.
- Maybe I don't want anyone to find me.

106
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:31,631
I'm not just anyone. My name is
Ergenia, daughter to Lord Cotys.

107
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:35,333
Your father is most fortunate
to have such a beautiful heir.

108
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,575
My father is most unfortunate.
He battles a warlord, Rhesus.

109
00:10:41,675 --> 00:10:45,629
Our land is torn by civil war. Every day,
villages are destroyed, crops ruined,

110
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:49,115
- innocents slaughtered.
- We all have problems.

111
00:10:49,716 --> 00:10:55,287
Well, perhaps I can convince you
to make our problems your own.

112
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,927
Unfortunately, My Lady, Hercules is fully
committed till the Feast of Dionysus.

113
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:04,632
We could, however, advance you to
the front of the line, for the right price.

114
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:07,401
Hmm. I thought heroes
fight for glory.

115
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,570
But mercenaries fight for gold.

116
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:12,506
- Lord Cotys is a rich man.
- I like him already.

117
00:11:12,606 --> 00:11:17,208
If you agree to aid him,
he will pay your weight in gold.

118
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:22,447
Eat up.

119
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:30,491
"A lion and crow in
strange alliance."

120
00:11:30,591 --> 00:11:32,757
Told you.

121
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,165
Where are we going?

122
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,394
It is good to see you safe, My Lady.

123
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,737
This war claims more victims every day.
We were concerned, My Lady.

124
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:54,108
Thank you, General Sitacles.
I was well protected.

125
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,142
Ah.

126
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:59,310
The mighty Hercules. An honor.

127
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:03,250
Though not quite as big
an honor as I expected.

128
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:07,519
General, go tell my
father Hercules is here.

129
00:13:10,591 --> 00:13:14,194
Uncle? Hera. Impressive.

130
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:18,999
It's meant to be. It took five years and
a thousand men to build her temple.

131
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,700
Hera is the patron goddess of Thrace.

132
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,739
Everyone knows the legend,
how Hera seeks to destroy Hercules.

133
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,843
Perhaps the right cause
might finally reconcile you.

134
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,478
Mother!

135
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,411
Arius.

136
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,385
- You're Hercules.
- That's right.

137
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,854
My name is Arius. I know
all your Labors by heart.

138
00:13:40,954 --> 00:13:43,624
You killed the giant
Geryon with a single blow,

139
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:46,593
- cleaned the Augean stables in one night.
- Hercules is probably tired.

140
00:13:46,693 --> 00:13:48,295
And the Labor of the Hide,
and the Labor of the Mares.

141
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:50,798
That's enough, Arius. Come along.

142
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:55,101
Stay away from him. Men who
deal in violence attract violence.

143
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:59,337
But he's Hercules. He's no
mere mortal. He's the greatest!

144
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:04,375
Lord Cotys will see you now.

145
00:14:10,584 --> 00:14:13,585
Have you ever met royalty, Hercules?

146
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:16,554
Once or twice.

147
00:14:32,406 --> 00:14:34,275
Father!

148
00:14:39,546 --> 00:14:41,179
Megara.

149
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,850
Welcome home, my love.

150
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,858
Hercules!

151
00:14:56,663 --> 00:15:00,501
Whenever I'm here, I imagine this
is what Elysium must look like.

152
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:06,206
Well, men like us have the means to
create our own paradise on Earth.

153
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:09,841
Look. Magnificent, aren't they?

154
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:15,446
Well, do not keep us in suspense.
Are we safe from the monster Hydra?

155
00:15:17,684 --> 00:15:20,285
The Hydra's heads, Your Majesty.

156
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:30,363
The masks of serpents.

157
00:15:30,864 --> 00:15:33,100
No wonder men thought
they were monsters.

158
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,870
You've done your sovereign
a great service. Come.

159
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,838
Let the people have their hero.

160
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,377
All hail King Eurystheus.

161
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:48,947
And the mighty protector
of Athens, Hercules!

162
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:53,051
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

163
00:15:53,152 --> 00:15:58,456
A man faced with such adoration might
be tempted to think himself a god.

164
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:02,961
I only want to be a
husband and a father.

165
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,170
Lord Cotys awaits.

166
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,791
Hercules.

167
00:16:34,628 --> 00:16:36,494
Welcome.

168
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:40,200
An honor to host such a legend.

169
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,634
Lord Cotys.

170
00:16:43,036 --> 00:16:46,072
But in legend, you fight alone.

171
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:50,642
My reputation would not
exist without my comrades.

172
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,211
Autolycus of Sparta.

173
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,315
Tydeus of Thebes.

174
00:16:58,986 --> 00:17:04,188
Atalanta of Scythia.
Iolaus of Athens.

175
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:08,793
- And Amphiaraus of Argos.
- Amphiaraus?

176
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,698
The famed seer of Argos.

177
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,101
It is said you have
glimpsed your own death,

178
00:17:15,201 --> 00:17:19,773
so you fight each battle knowing
that it is not yet your time to die.

179
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,275
What else can you tell of the future?

180
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:25,279
Only what the gods see fit to reveal.

181
00:17:25,379 --> 00:17:29,516
A shame. It would have been a great
gift to know the outcome of this war.

182
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:33,353
The gods can be frustrating
sometimes, Lord Cotys.

183
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:45,132
With respect, I fear that the task ahead
might not be suitable for a woman,

184
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:48,466
even if she is an Amazon warrior.

185
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:56,710
I stand corrected.

186
00:17:59,645 --> 00:18:02,415
When the kings of yesteryear
built this citadel,

187
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:05,686
it was intended as the
high seat of all Thrace.

188
00:18:05,786 --> 00:18:10,890
- But now Thrace is divided.
- This war has depleted our forces.

189
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,661
We're left with nothing but farmers
and merchants to replenish our army.

190
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,996
It takes every one of
us to resist Rhesus.

191
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,867
People think that he cannot be
killed by an ordinary mortal.

192
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,301
Only by a god.

193
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,638
Rhesus is a sorcerer.

194
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:28,975
<i>His magic words confuse men,
bend them to his will.</i>

195
00:18:29,075 --> 00:18:33,711
<i>He leads an army of monsters,
half horse, half human.</i>

196
00:18:34,915 --> 00:18:36,049
Centaurs?

197
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:39,884
- You've actually seen them?
- They have been seen.

198
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:48,092
Come, Hercules. Let me show you
what misery Rhesus has brought us.

199
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:55,201
Every week, more refugees
arrive seeking my protection,

200
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:59,973
most of them covered in blood,
crippled or burnt by Rhesus' men.

201
00:19:00,073 --> 00:19:05,144
I feared nothing could ever be
good again, till you arrived.

202
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:08,412
I'm just a mercenary
fighting for gold.

203
00:19:08,882 --> 00:19:12,652
How we view ourselves
is of little consequence.

204
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:15,222
How others perceive us is important.

205
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:20,892
And your name, like it or
not, is a rallying cry.

206
00:19:26,632 --> 00:19:30,904
I have seen too much reality to trust
in legends, and I am not alone.

207
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,972
Nobody has any faith anymore.

208
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:39,713
The people need a hero.
They need someone to look up to.

209
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:44,048
My son believes in you.

210
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:50,655
Bring us peace, and...
I will believe in you, too.

211
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:00,733
I'm convinced these are good people.

212
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,136
I see. And who's more convincing,
Cotys or his daughter?

213
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,174
All the gold on Earth is not as
convincing as a pair of breasts.

214
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,509
Maybe, but gold never ages.

215
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,778
Which is why I got them
to double our price.

216
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:15,482
Double your weight in gold?
Well done.

217
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:18,051
- Amphiaraus?
- If it be the will of Zeus.

218
00:20:18,151 --> 00:20:22,029
Which title sounds more terrifying to
our enemies? "Hercules: Savior of Thrace"

219
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:26,625
- or "Hercules: A Legend is Born"?
- Both sound terrifyingly boring.

220
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,128
What are we supposed to
do with an army of farmers?

221
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,567
Train them.

222
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:36,435
Oh, shit.

223
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:47,180
In war, there is one thing
more important than killing.

224
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,286
Surviving. My companions and I
will show you how to stay alive,

225
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:58,055
so that you may return home
to your farms someday.

226
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,762
Autolycus.

227
00:21:01,862 --> 00:21:04,595
Shield wall! Form!

228
00:21:21,882 --> 00:21:24,450
Corpses! Every last one of you!

229
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,788
Because your shield wall was weak.

230
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:31,191
Dead. Dead.

231
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,090
Very dead.

232
00:21:34,327 --> 00:21:38,231
Soldier, many lives depend on you.

233
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:41,666
When attacked, lock your
feet in the ground.

234
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:47,007
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

235
00:21:47,107 --> 00:21:52,278
When a shield wall is strong,
nothing can ever defeat it!

236
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:55,814
You must learn to work together,
react together.

237
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:59,919
When you do, each individual
will become a link in a chain

238
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:03,054
that will be stronger than iron.

239
00:22:07,127 --> 00:22:09,894
I hope the enemy has
a sense of humor.

240
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:14,867
Right. Today's lesson,
how not to stab yourselves!

241
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:20,407
It is imperative that we strike now,
My Lord, given this opportunity.

242
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:22,742
Ah! There you are!

243
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:26,980
Hercules, my scouts have
brought news. Rhesus is on the move.

244
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,149
Archers who shoot lightning
from their bows.

245
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:33,119
And infantry 4,000-strong,
their minds bewitched.

246
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:36,956
- Demons march with them.
- So now we're fighting demons.

247
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,959
No stranger than the monsters
I hear you faced, Hercules.

248
00:22:40,059 --> 00:22:43,830
My Lord, Rhesus is preparing
to attack Bessi lands.

249
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:45,632
He will be on them within six days.

250
00:22:45,732 --> 00:22:49,402
If the Bessi fall, we're next.
Unless we intercept him.

251
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,839
Your men need weeks, if not months,
of training before they're ready.

252
00:22:52,939 --> 00:22:56,242
The Bessi are a fierce
but primitive tribe.

253
00:22:56,342 --> 00:22:59,913
If we do not protect them,
then there will be a bloodbath.

254
00:23:00,013 --> 00:23:03,483
Face Rhesus with an untrained army and you
risk losing far more than a single battle.

255
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:09,053
My Lord, Rhesus is coming.
I vouch my life on it.

256
00:23:09,322 --> 00:23:11,423
The longer Rhesus lives,

257
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:16,362
the more villages will be burnt and
the more innocents will be killed.

258
00:23:16,462 --> 00:23:20,798
Assemble your men. We march tomorrow.

259
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,506
Hercules, the gods have
offered us a gift.

260
00:23:26,606 --> 00:23:28,308
We must not squander it.

261
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:31,778
Are your gods going
to be fighting with us?

262
00:23:31,878 --> 00:23:36,347
No. The son of Zeus will.

263
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:54,098
I've seen how you
watch over Hercules.

264
00:23:55,869 --> 00:23:58,104
Tell me,

265
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,907
how did a woman,

266
00:24:01,007 --> 00:24:03,276
beautiful woman,

267
00:24:03,376 --> 00:24:06,780
fall in with these hardened men?

268
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,779
Killers?

269
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:15,388
Son of Zeus need a
woman's protection?

270
00:24:15,488 --> 00:24:18,088
I don't protect him.

271
00:24:18,992 --> 00:24:21,659
I protect you from him.

272
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:24,495
Hmm.

273
00:24:44,717 --> 00:24:48,886
General, from now on, maybe you
should favor the company of your men.

274
00:24:56,396 --> 00:25:00,433
- He pulled a knife?
- It was only a small prick.

275
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:44,244
Your mother told you to
stay away. You should listen.

276
00:25:44,344 --> 00:25:46,510
What's wrong with him?

277
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:52,449
Tydeus is my most loyal warrior.

278
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:59,723
He was born in war. When I found
him, he was more animal than human.

279
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:08,265
He never speaks of what he saw.
He never speaks at all.

280
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:11,935
But he relives it every night.

281
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,407
Come. Let's find your mother.

282
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:25,284
When I grow up, I want to
be a great hero like you.

283
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:28,488
- Like me?
- No hero is greater than Hercules.

284
00:26:28,588 --> 00:26:32,394
I know all your Labors. Like the Cretan
Bull, you wrestled it for seven days

285
00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:34,627
- and seven nights.
- Uh, that's a bit exaggerated.

286
00:26:34,727 --> 00:26:38,464
- And struck it 49 times with your club.
- Maybe not quite that many.

287
00:26:38,564 --> 00:26:42,835
Until it fell dead and Crete was saved.
It's my favorite Labor.

288
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:48,608
Also Queen Hippolyta's Belt, with its
buxom Amazons and exciting bondage.

289
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:52,743
- Do you even know what that means?
- No.

290
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:03,790
- Mother.
- Arius.

291
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:06,957
You're supposed to be in bed.

292
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:12,631
- Why are you in the hospice?
- My mother saves people's lives.

293
00:27:13,232 --> 00:27:15,134
Many of our physicians
were killed during battle.

294
00:27:15,234 --> 00:27:19,836
So, out of necessity, I taught
myself the art of healing.

295
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:24,877
If I could be like you, I would protect all
of Thrace and no one would ever get hurt.

296
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,287
Here.

297
00:27:37,056 --> 00:27:40,657
I was going to give
this to someone else,

298
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,128
but I never got the chance.

299
00:27:44,864 --> 00:27:46,966
Only a hero may wear this.

300
00:27:47,066 --> 00:27:50,901
But to become a hero,
you must grow strong.

301
00:27:53,473 --> 00:27:55,408
Is this the Nemean Lion's tooth?

302
00:27:55,508 --> 00:27:58,609
- It is.
- Thank you.

303
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:01,814
- Thank you.
- Good night.

304
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,181
Good night, Hercules.

305
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,855
Have no fear.

306
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:15,161
If you fall in the service of a just
cause, your souls will go to Elysium,

307
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:19,966
where they will dwell forever
among the shades of heroes,

308
00:28:20,066 --> 00:28:22,568
- like Theseus.
- Odysseus!

309
00:28:22,668 --> 00:28:24,303
And the great Achilles.

310
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:29,273
Or if you're lucky, you'll go to Hades,
where all the fun people are.

311
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:40,552
Iolaus. Your place is beside
Lord Cotys, where it's safe.

312
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:43,523
I've been giving it a lot of thought,
and I really feel I'm ready to fight.

313
00:28:43,623 --> 00:28:45,225
You're a storyteller, not a warrior.

314
00:28:45,325 --> 00:28:49,695
- We share the same blood.
- And I will not see it shed. Chariot.

315
00:28:49,795 --> 00:28:51,863
Now.

316
00:28:58,638 --> 00:29:03,576
Thracians, the shield wall
is your home. Your shelter.

317
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:07,580
When you sleep,
the wall is your blanket.

318
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,217
When you fight,
the wall is your armor.

319
00:29:11,317 --> 00:29:17,490
The shield wall will never break formation
as long as there is breath in your body.

320
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:20,390
Remember these words,

321
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:23,393
and you will taste victory.

322
00:29:23,996 --> 00:29:27,030
- Move the army out!
- Move out!

323
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:35,734
Halt!

324
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,202
Halt!

325
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:39,970
- Halt!
- Halt!

326
00:31:10,837 --> 00:31:16,206
We are too late. Rhesus
has already been here.

327
00:31:18,778 --> 00:31:22,980
Leave the chariots.
We'll go down on foot.

328
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:54,511
The lion and crow cross
a field of corpses.

329
00:31:55,381 --> 00:31:58,582
I hate being right all the time.

330
00:32:03,456 --> 00:32:04,156
Halt.

331
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:07,123
- Halt!
- Halt!

332
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,169
This head is rotting.

333
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:22,839
A week old, at least.

334
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:28,578
Yet some of these bodies are fresh.

335
00:32:42,762 --> 00:32:44,328
Uncle!

336
00:32:52,972 --> 00:32:56,840
And we've walked into a trap.

337
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:06,852
Shield wall! Form a single square!
Protect Lord Cotys! Iolaus, go!

338
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:09,086
Shield wall!

339
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,733
We're here to help them.
Why are they attacking?

340
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:24,704
This is Rhesus' doing. They say his
spells have the power to cloud minds.

341
00:33:24,804 --> 00:33:28,171
Turn comrades against each other.

342
00:33:35,447 --> 00:33:38,615
King's guards, around Lord Cotys!

343
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:49,428
Amphiaraus, do we die in this battle?

344
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:54,331
My time's not come yet.
Not sure about yours.

345
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,534
That's comforting.

346
00:34:04,844 --> 00:34:07,544
I think he wants a challenge.

347
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:30,603
Hercules' fists have been dipped
in the blood of the Hydra!

348
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:33,637
Lethal to anyone but him!

349
00:34:35,575 --> 00:34:37,441
Watch!

350
00:34:49,054 --> 00:34:52,489
- Did you see that?
- The gods fight on our side!

351
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,962
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

352
00:34:57,062 --> 00:35:00,332
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

353
00:35:00,432 --> 00:35:02,001
Hercules! Hercules!

354
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:05,769
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

355
00:35:19,085 --> 00:35:21,318
Battle position!

356
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:33,930
Lady Artemis, if I am to fall,
let me be judged...

357
00:36:07,299 --> 00:36:09,266
Stand fast!

358
00:36:24,116 --> 00:36:26,483
Hold your position!

359
00:36:41,567 --> 00:36:43,700
Do not yield!

360
00:37:39,158 --> 00:37:43,026
No retreat! Stay in the wall!

361
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:46,799
Hold the lines! Do not yield!

362
00:37:46,899 --> 00:37:50,300
Defend Lord Cotys!

363
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:19,161
The wall has been breached!

364
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:25,935
Seal up the shield wall!
Defend Lord Cotys!

365
00:38:31,577 --> 00:38:33,310
Whip!

366
00:38:43,288 --> 00:38:45,290
Hercules!

367
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,390
Bring the chariots!

368
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:57,000
Defend your Lord!

369
00:39:07,312 --> 00:39:10,046
No!

370
00:40:25,290 --> 00:40:26,658
Advance!

371
00:40:26,758 --> 00:40:28,992
Advance!

372
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,411
Make way!

373
00:40:59,358 --> 00:41:02,192
Where is Rhesus?

374
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,781
Lord Cotys.

375
00:41:25,017 --> 00:41:27,719
We came here to save this village,

376
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,721
but, no, they killed half my army.

377
00:41:32,057 --> 00:41:35,661
Rhesus. This is all his doing.

378
00:41:35,761 --> 00:41:38,396
And yours. I warned you.

379
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,300
Your men are brave,
but untrained, unprepared for battle.

380
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,734
Give me time to make warriors.

381
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:49,238
Very well.

382
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:57,047
Cover up, before your loyal army
sees you bleed like a mortal.

383
00:42:06,692 --> 00:42:09,928
Phineas. You plead your life.

384
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:12,695
And I gladly offer it.

385
00:42:13,732 --> 00:42:16,565
I failed to see this trap.
The fault is mine!

386
00:42:16,665 --> 00:42:19,770
- Spare the other scouts.
- General Sitacles.

387
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:23,641
I think we've lost enough
men for the day, don't you?

388
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,110
But just to avoid future
misunderstandings,

389
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,682
I'll be taking charge of
your scouts from now on.

390
00:42:29,782 --> 00:42:32,048
Is that clear?

391
00:42:37,189 --> 00:42:38,590
Thank you.

392
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:42,492
Another mistake, I'll end you myself.

393
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:16,861
I'm applying a salve of mint,
chamomile and clay to seal the wound.

394
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:21,032
This is extract of lithops for
the pain, a powerful sedative.

395
00:43:21,132 --> 00:43:25,103
It should rest you after consuming it.
It may have certain side effects.

396
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:26,838
I don't need it.

397
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,275
Ah, forgive me, I forgot.
No mortal can harm Hercules.

398
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:35,345
And, uh, your lion's
hide is indestructible?

399
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:39,348
Drink, son of Zeus.

400
00:43:41,419 --> 00:43:45,490
Arius' father was the same,
he distrusted medicines.

401
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:47,125
Where is he now?

402
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:50,829
Taken by the gods
before my son was born.

403
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,997
I'm sorry. I never knew my father.

404
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,470
Well, he must have been
very, very strong.

405
00:44:02,607 --> 00:44:06,878
- Tell me about Arius.
- Oh. He's a good boy.

406
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:10,449
And someday, he will
make a fine king.

407
00:44:10,549 --> 00:44:12,482
Do you have any children?

408
00:44:16,021 --> 00:44:20,156
- Do they live in Athens?
- Thank you for your care.

409
00:44:30,035 --> 00:44:32,769
The sedative will help you rest.

410
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:09,573
How could you do such a terrible thing?
By law, I should execute you,

411
00:45:09,673 --> 00:45:13,044
but I believe a more fitting
punishment would be to let you live.

412
00:45:13,144 --> 00:45:16,814
So you can walk the earth in
torment, haunted by the knowledge

413
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:22,184
that you alone are responsible for
the death of your loved ones.

414
00:45:22,921 --> 00:45:25,290
The great Hercules.

415
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:30,328
Hands forever stained
with innocent blood.

416
00:45:30,428 --> 00:45:33,165
Get out, you monster.

417
00:45:33,265 --> 00:45:35,365
Get out!

418
00:46:46,305 --> 00:46:49,040
No!

419
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:31,216
It happened again, didn't it, hmm?

420
00:47:31,316 --> 00:47:35,253
Another vision of Cerberus,
the three-headed beast of Hades?

421
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:39,124
The gods show you things they
don't share with others.

422
00:47:39,224 --> 00:47:42,660
There's a word for that. Madness.

423
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:46,417
When we were driven from Athens,
I consulted the Oracle of Delphi...

424
00:47:46,517 --> 00:47:49,634
on your behalf. Do you
remember her prophecy?

425
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:53,672
"Hercules must finish the Labor
that remains unfinished."

426
00:47:53,772 --> 00:47:56,240
And what is that, Hercules?

427
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,612
Confront the beast that haunts you.
Only then will you find peace.

428
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:03,837
I speak from experience. No matter how
far you run, no matter how fast you go,

429
00:48:03,937 --> 00:48:09,386
the beast will follow.
Man cannot escape his fate.

430
00:48:24,502 --> 00:48:27,137
Room for one more in your company?

431
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:31,743
It'd be a pleasure having female
companionship for a change.

432
00:48:31,843 --> 00:48:34,279
Atalanta doesn't quite count.
No offense.

433
00:48:34,379 --> 00:48:37,682
If only your manhood was
as long as your tongue.

434
00:48:37,782 --> 00:48:40,716
Both can satisfy in different ways.

435
00:48:43,287 --> 00:48:47,592
You're a famed storyteller, Iolaus.
Grace me with a story.

436
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:50,595
Any particular subject, My Lady?

437
00:48:50,695 --> 00:48:54,930
Murder, of a woman
and her three children.

438
00:48:56,567 --> 00:48:59,738
Is it true? Did Hercules
slaughter his own family?

439
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:02,741
- Who said so?
- Oh, soldiers talk.

440
00:49:02,841 --> 00:49:05,743
They say if Hercules
ever returns to Athens,

441
00:49:05,843 --> 00:49:08,711
King Eurystheus will
have him executed.

442
00:49:12,850 --> 00:49:16,121
Hercules had completed his Labors
and returned home. But Hera...

443
00:49:16,221 --> 00:49:19,024
No myths. I want the truth.

444
00:49:19,124 --> 00:49:21,590
No one knows the truth.

445
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:23,819
Not for sure.

446
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:28,733
We found Hercules alone. His wife,
Megara and the children, dead.

447
00:49:28,833 --> 00:49:32,969
- He remembers nothing.
- Do you believe he is innocent?

448
00:49:33,752 --> 00:49:38,543
We grew up together, both orphans,
trying to survive in the streets of Athens.

449
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:43,014
We found a home in the army.
Looked out for each other.

450
00:49:43,114 --> 00:49:47,284
Hercules' strength set him apart.

451
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:51,322
Kings of Athens started to send him
on all the most dangerous missions.

452
00:49:51,422 --> 00:49:54,993
- The Twelve Labors.
- And he took me with him.

453
00:49:55,093 --> 00:49:59,929
To fight by his side. And with
each mission, our numbers grew.

454
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:04,268
Scythia, the Amazon kingdom where
the royal family had been assassinated.

455
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,105
My family was gone.
Everyone was gone.

456
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,974
Hercules helped me
avenge their murder.

457
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:12,610
He became my brother-in-arms.

458
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:18,317
Thebes, the city of corpses,
where we found a single child,

459
00:50:18,417 --> 00:50:20,585
still alive.

460
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:26,355
Hercules took Tydeus in when everyone
else saw nothing but a wild animal.

461
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:30,228
You know how a rumor spreads.
How a legend grows.

462
00:50:30,328 --> 00:50:32,529
Hercules' deeds were so incredible,

463
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:36,267
they could not possibly have
been performed by a mere mortal.

464
00:50:36,367 --> 00:50:38,478
So we played along.

465
00:50:38,578 --> 00:50:43,108
We encourage people to think Hercules
was the son of Zeus. It's good.

466
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:46,745
Scares the enemy. Iolaus helps.

467
00:50:46,845 --> 00:50:49,144
He talks nice.

468
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:54,783
You're very loyal friends.
You're avoiding my question.

469
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,957
Hercules is a warrior. And there
is something that haunts warriors.

470
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:04,162
It can cloud their minds.
We call it the Blood Rage.

471
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:06,831
This rage afflicted Hercules.

472
00:51:06,931 --> 00:51:09,834
He made me vow to keep
the world away from him.

473
00:51:09,934 --> 00:51:12,837
To make sure that he would
never harm innocents again.

474
00:51:12,937 --> 00:51:16,474
And that, My Lady, is the truth.

475
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,276
The truth,

476
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:22,246
whatever the truth,

477
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:25,216
the death of his loved
ones haunts Hercules.

478
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:28,384
Only the gods can help him,

479
00:51:28,753 --> 00:51:31,253
if he listens.

480
00:51:37,161 --> 00:51:40,464
Come! Gather around,
soldiers of Thrace, and behold,

481
00:51:40,564 --> 00:51:43,902
when Hercules gives an order,
even the gods listen.

482
00:51:44,002 --> 00:51:48,505
Zeus' master ironsmith,
using the forges of your own citadel,

483
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:52,977
has crafted these divine weapons
that will make you invincible.

484
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:56,080
As steel is hewn into shields,

485
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,082
so, too, will you be
hewn into warriors.

486
00:52:01,652 --> 00:52:06,055
You shall carry the
shield of Hercules!

487
00:52:13,465 --> 00:52:14,665
It's lighter.

488
00:52:14,765 --> 00:52:19,670
Infused with the souls of Stymphalian
birds from Hercules' sixth Labor!

489
00:52:19,770 --> 00:52:23,939
Spirits of birds?
How does that work, exactly?

490
00:52:24,475 --> 00:52:28,997
Well, much as birds take flight, so,
too, are these shields lighter than air.

491
00:52:29,097 --> 00:52:31,580
It's in the fibers. Here.

492
00:52:31,716 --> 00:52:35,050
Try on the helmet of Hercules.

493
00:52:40,959 --> 00:52:42,356
It covers my whole face.

494
00:52:42,456 --> 00:52:47,225
Forged after Hercules' very own helmet,
when he defeated the demon Geryon.

495
00:52:47,325 --> 00:52:51,734
You sure it wasn't your horseshit
that frightened Geryon to death?

496
00:52:51,903 --> 00:52:52,537
Mmm?

497
00:52:52,637 --> 00:52:58,440
General Sitacles, perhaps you would
care to inspect the armor of Hercules?

498
00:53:13,091 --> 00:53:16,861
Leather armor? Mmm?

499
00:53:16,961 --> 00:53:19,197
We will be skewered like pigs.

500
00:53:23,034 --> 00:53:25,200
Linothorax.

501
00:53:25,569 --> 00:53:28,840
Hewn from the skin of
the Erymanthean Boar.

502
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:31,540
It's indestructible.

503
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:37,313
Wait. If it's indestructible,
how did Hercules cut it off the boar?

504
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:41,486
He used an indestructible blade.

505
00:54:01,006 --> 00:54:05,639
One, two.

506
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:12,849
Get up.

507
00:54:14,552 --> 00:54:15,784
Next!

508
00:54:22,927 --> 00:54:24,696
Again!

509
00:54:24,796 --> 00:54:26,895
Both eyes open.

510
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:30,232
Keep practicing.

511
00:54:31,802 --> 00:54:33,938
Firmer grip.

512
00:54:34,238 --> 00:54:36,205
Elbow up.

513
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:38,076
Good.

514
00:54:38,176 --> 00:54:40,542
Shield wall! Form!

515
00:54:45,316 --> 00:54:47,049
Stand tall.

516
00:54:49,821 --> 00:54:51,653
Excellent.

517
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,249
Careful you don't cut yourself, boy.

518
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,318
Again!

519
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:35,033
Rhesus is here. Close enough to
stick a blade between his ribs.

520
00:55:35,133 --> 00:55:37,050
- What did you see?
- Centaurs.

521
00:55:37,150 --> 00:55:40,135
Half man, half horse.
Hundreds of them.

522
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:42,244
He saw shadows in the night.

523
00:55:42,344 --> 00:55:47,777
My Lord, I will go ahead into the Rhesus
camp. I will bring word of his plans.

524
00:55:51,782 --> 00:55:56,821
If we let them get past Mount Asticus,
Thrace will fall. You want to stop Rhesus?

525
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:58,956
We'll go through the forest
and they'll never see us coming.

526
00:55:59,056 --> 00:56:03,025
It'll slow down
our chariots. A gamble.

527
00:56:03,161 --> 00:56:05,027
I have a plan.

528
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:12,332
The scouts have returned. Rhesus
has made his camp in Mount Asticus,

529
00:56:12,432 --> 00:56:17,273
72 leagues away. Once these
men are ready, we march.

530
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:21,178
So, have you seen if we win or lose?

531
00:56:21,479 --> 00:56:25,083
The gods have been annoyingly
silent on that matter.

532
00:56:25,183 --> 00:56:27,443
What they have told me is
that I'm soon to discover...

533
00:56:27,543 --> 00:56:30,043
there truly is a heaven or a hell.

534
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:32,797
When will you die?

535
00:56:32,897 --> 00:56:36,526
Within a week in a place that
looks an awful lot like hell.

536
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:40,398
As always, the gods are
generous with hints,

537
00:56:40,498 --> 00:56:43,365
but cheap on specifics.

538
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:46,853
Oh, cheer up, Hercules.

539
00:56:46,953 --> 00:56:51,740
I've lived, not always well,
but long enough.

540
00:56:52,777 --> 00:56:55,978
I'm ready for what's next.

541
00:57:00,952 --> 00:57:03,921
Thracians, halt!

542
00:57:05,122 --> 00:57:08,123
Shield wall! Form!

543
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:13,529
Battle positions!

544
00:57:16,034 --> 00:57:18,400
Tydeus?

545
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,791
There is no enemy camp.

546
00:58:05,891 --> 00:58:08,850
This is the right place.

547
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:29,938
Centaurs! They're real.

548
00:58:53,063 --> 00:58:55,464
It seems that we're expected.

549
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:12,414
Centaurs?

550
00:59:32,403 --> 00:59:33,742
Rhesus!

551
00:59:33,842 --> 00:59:38,974
You have come looking for a fight,
and we are happy to oblige.

552
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:44,515
Hercules. The son of Zeus.
Your legend ends here.

553
00:59:44,615 --> 00:59:46,448
Look at me.

554
00:59:46,984 --> 00:59:48,917
Do I look afraid?

555
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,760
Phineas.

556
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:03,000
Traitor! Hades will have you!

557
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:05,702
After it has you, My Lord.

558
01:00:05,903 --> 01:00:09,626
It is over, Cotys.
Mount Asticus on your front.

559
01:00:09,726 --> 01:00:14,011
The woods at your back. And my
troops outman you three to one.

560
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:18,881
Surrender now, and we shall
consider being merciful.

561
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:22,584
Men die who speak to my
lord in such a manner.

562
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,625
You've made your choice.

563
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:47,342
Go!

564
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:01,592
In this moment, on this day,

565
01:01:01,692 --> 01:01:05,528
become the man you were born to be!

566
01:01:05,929 --> 01:01:10,700
You have it within yourselves
to write your own legends!

567
01:01:10,901 --> 01:01:15,806
Let it be to death or victory!

568
01:01:19,277 --> 01:01:22,243
Charge!

569
01:01:29,153 --> 01:01:30,921
Shield wall!

570
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,989
Flanks out!

571
01:01:42,266 --> 01:01:44,699
Maybe today.

572
01:02:05,356 --> 01:02:07,455
Now!

573
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:28,012
Watch as the Amazon uses
the arrows of Artemis...

574
01:02:28,112 --> 01:02:30,545
Silence, boy!

575
01:02:34,819 --> 01:02:36,554
Spears forward!

576
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,572
Archers, ready!

577
01:02:57,909 --> 01:02:59,507
Loose!

578
01:03:50,995 --> 01:03:52,928
Advance!

579
01:04:01,405 --> 01:04:03,705
Set them aflame!

580
01:04:07,745 --> 01:04:09,878
Take cover!

581
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:12,547
Defend Lord Cotys!

582
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:32,903
Maybe not.

583
01:04:33,003 --> 01:04:35,470
Shield wall! Attack!

584
01:04:38,309 --> 01:04:40,575
Push forward!

585
01:04:53,457 --> 01:04:56,992
To kill a snake, cut off its head.

586
01:05:12,743 --> 01:05:15,679
Victory is yours, Lord Cotys!

587
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:18,813
It is not over yet!

588
01:05:51,748 --> 01:05:54,318
Fucking centaurs.

589
01:05:59,923 --> 01:06:03,727
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

590
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:08,365
Hail, Lord Cotys! Hail, Lord Cotys!

591
01:06:08,465 --> 01:06:11,201
Hail, Lord Cotys!

592
01:06:37,761 --> 01:06:40,095
Halt!

593
01:06:46,269 --> 01:06:47,303
Get up.

594
01:06:48,639 --> 01:06:50,272
Get up.

595
01:06:57,247 --> 01:06:59,414
- Up.
- Enough!

596
01:07:09,426 --> 01:07:12,461
You helped a tyrant enslave a nation.

597
01:07:12,562 --> 01:07:15,365
All I did was stop you from
burning more villages.

598
01:07:15,465 --> 01:07:18,702
- I burned no villages.
- Then who did?

599
01:07:18,802 --> 01:07:20,025
Ask yourself,

600
01:07:20,125 --> 01:07:23,440
if Cotys is beloved, why did he need to
hire mercenaries to do his dirty work?

601
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:25,107
Keep moving, dog.

602
01:07:25,508 --> 01:07:28,643
You've been fighting
on the wrong side.

603
01:08:01,678 --> 01:08:03,212
Where are you going?

604
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:06,347
I'm taking some water
to the prisoner.

605
01:08:07,951 --> 01:08:09,817
Sit down.

606
01:08:14,625 --> 01:08:16,891
It's time.

607
01:08:26,136 --> 01:08:30,004
Thrace is finally united.

608
01:08:31,342 --> 01:08:33,444
One land,

609
01:08:33,544 --> 01:08:35,743
one King,

610
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,613
one Thrace.

611
01:08:39,049 --> 01:08:43,086
One land! One King! One Thrace!

612
01:08:43,186 --> 01:08:48,025
Thrace is not a man, a king,
or a god! Thrace is her people!

613
01:08:55,298 --> 01:08:57,901
Who cares what Rhesus claims?
Our work is done.

614
01:08:58,001 --> 01:09:00,401
Let's collect our fee and be gone.

615
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:13,815
Don't do anything foolish.

616
01:09:16,053 --> 01:09:18,386
Where are you going?

617
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:28,265
I saw pity in your eyes
for Rhesus. Why?

618
01:09:28,365 --> 01:09:33,201
Look at me. Cotys is responsible
for this war, isn't he?

619
01:09:36,206 --> 01:09:40,410
You lie very well. Clearly,
your father's daughter.

620
01:09:40,510 --> 01:09:45,181
I didn't do it for my father.
I did it for my son.

621
01:09:45,281 --> 01:09:49,653
If I disobeyed Cotys or resisted in
any way, Arius would be executed.

622
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:54,155
I did what any mother would.
I protected my child.

623
01:09:54,591 --> 01:09:59,930
My husband was king. And Cotys
poisoned him to take his place.

624
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:02,599
Rhesus fought back.
Civil war broke out.

625
01:10:02,699 --> 01:10:06,334
Arius is the legitimate king.

626
01:10:07,504 --> 01:10:12,876
My father is old. He will not
live forever, and once he is gone,

627
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:17,013
my son will be a good king.

628
01:10:17,113 --> 01:10:21,416
- And he will heal this land.
- That's a dream.

629
01:10:22,386 --> 01:10:25,845
And you can help. Please,
when you leave Thrace,

630
01:10:25,945 --> 01:10:29,624
take Arius with you.
Please keep him safe.

631
01:10:29,760 --> 01:10:31,961
Find another savior.

632
01:10:32,162 --> 01:10:33,761
Hercules?

633
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,899
The King commands your presence.

634
01:10:42,506 --> 01:10:44,672
My Lady.

635
01:10:54,685 --> 01:10:57,086
Ah, champion of Thrace!

636
01:10:57,687 --> 01:10:59,957
Something tells me we're
not gonna get paid.

637
01:11:00,057 --> 01:11:03,625
- You could be right.
- Oh, shit.

638
01:11:05,996 --> 01:11:08,766
You wanted conquerors, not heroes.

639
01:11:08,866 --> 01:11:13,069
- You betrayed me, Cotys.
- Betrayed?

640
01:11:13,570 --> 01:11:17,140
A mercenary who has long since
sold his conscience for gold

641
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:20,544
can hardly presume to
judge his employers.

642
01:11:20,644 --> 01:11:23,344
Let's not quibble about details.

643
01:11:27,183 --> 01:11:31,455
We all know your legend, Hercules.
But here is mine.

644
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:37,327
When I was a general in the army of Thrace,
I had dreams of ruling this kingdom.

645
01:11:37,427 --> 01:11:43,632
But thanks to you, my dreams
have grown. I now crave an empire.

646
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:48,438
My thousands will train more
thousands, and they even more.

647
01:11:48,538 --> 01:11:50,674
The lessons of Hercules will spread.

648
01:11:50,774 --> 01:11:53,376
What you began here
can never be stopped.

649
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:58,679
And if you fear what
such an army may do,

650
01:11:59,049 --> 01:12:01,282
then lead it.

651
01:12:04,321 --> 01:12:08,158
You want me to serve you?

652
01:12:08,258 --> 01:12:11,795
Spare me the moral outrage.

653
01:12:11,895 --> 01:12:14,028
Child killer.

654
01:12:15,832 --> 01:12:19,967
Getting us all killed, bad idea.

655
01:12:22,972 --> 01:12:27,375
Well, I must take this as a "no."

656
01:12:27,577 --> 01:12:29,710
In that case,

657
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:33,748
your services are no longer required.

658
01:12:37,053 --> 01:12:40,788
You will be paid in full.
Bring them the gold.

659
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:26,000
If we hurry, we can be spending
our fortunes in Macedonia.

660
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:30,972
Take mine, too.

661
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,945
What do you think
you're doing? Let's go.

662
01:13:36,546 --> 01:13:38,248
There will be no more
innocent blood on my hands.

663
01:13:38,348 --> 01:13:41,716
I can't leave without
setting this right.

664
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:47,791
Oh, I see. And who's gonna be paying
us for this suicidal endeavor?

665
01:13:47,891 --> 01:13:51,826
- Thrace needs our help.
- To hell with Thrace. We have gold.

666
01:13:52,162 --> 01:13:55,540
You remember the Black Sea.
That beach you spoke of is within reach.

667
01:13:55,640 --> 01:13:58,299
Leave now, be free.

668
01:13:59,736 --> 01:14:02,503
I would never be free.

669
01:14:04,608 --> 01:14:07,575
In this fight, you're alone.

670
01:14:09,412 --> 01:14:11,013
Never saw that one coming.

671
01:14:11,414 --> 01:14:13,617
- How can you just walk away?
- You can't just leave.

672
01:14:13,717 --> 01:14:15,751
- Why not?
- It's all right.

673
01:14:16,052 --> 01:14:19,456
You've sacrificed your lives for me.
Now you can finally be free.

674
01:14:19,556 --> 01:14:22,359
Whatever debt you feel
you owe me is paid.

675
01:14:22,459 --> 01:14:24,525
Debt?

676
01:14:24,961 --> 01:14:28,796
You think we follow you
because we owe you?

677
01:14:29,032 --> 01:14:31,265
Look around, Hercules.

678
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:36,071
We're family.
All we have is each other.

679
01:14:36,672 --> 01:14:40,677
We will fight for you. And if it's
our time, we will die for you.

680
01:14:40,777 --> 01:14:43,444
Because you would die for us.

681
01:14:45,381 --> 01:14:48,316
Take that, too. I have no need of it.

682
01:14:48,418 --> 01:14:50,954
- This is madness.
- You want madness?

683
01:14:51,054 --> 01:14:55,423
Tonight, a spear of flame
will pierce my heart.

684
01:14:56,425 --> 01:15:00,161
Is that not the most insane
death you've ever heard of?

685
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:12,843
Crazy. The lot of you.

686
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:14,744
Autolycus.

687
01:15:14,844 --> 01:15:18,779
Iolaus. Go with Autolycus.

688
01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:21,017
- I think I'll stay.
- Nephew.

689
01:15:21,117 --> 01:15:26,887
Uncle, all I've ever done is tell stories
of great deeds performed by others.

690
01:15:27,590 --> 01:15:32,595
It's time I stopped telling their stories.
Started living my own.

691
01:15:32,695 --> 01:15:37,164
Well, you may have all completely
lost your minds, but not me.

692
01:15:37,834 --> 01:15:40,001
Not me.

693
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,605
Autolycus?

694
01:15:47,177 --> 01:15:50,011
Live like a king, my friend.

695
01:15:59,322 --> 01:16:01,322
What about Cotys?

696
01:16:03,526 --> 01:16:07,995
He paid us to save Thrace.
Let's not disappoint him.

697
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:38,926
Lay down your arms.

698
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:45,833
Lay down your arms!
Or your nephew dies first.

699
01:17:01,451 --> 01:17:05,255
I invite you to join me. You refuse.

700
01:17:05,355 --> 01:17:08,624
I order you to leave. You return.

701
01:17:09,324 --> 01:17:12,059
Get your hands off me.

702
01:17:13,196 --> 01:17:16,564
I overheard her
conspiring with Hercules.

703
01:17:16,665 --> 01:17:20,434
They were planning to remove the
young Prince from your protection.

704
01:17:25,341 --> 01:17:26,510
No.

705
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:29,612
Let go of him! Don't touch him!

706
01:17:32,916 --> 01:17:35,416
Arius! No!

707
01:17:38,855 --> 01:17:43,326
- No! You're hurting him! No!
- Hercules, no! Help me! Stop!

708
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:46,263
- Help! No!
- Arius. No.

709
01:17:46,363 --> 01:17:49,163
Arius! No!

710
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:38,746
Magnificent, aren't they?

711
01:18:39,015 --> 01:18:42,000
An extraordinary species.

712
01:18:42,100 --> 01:18:46,355
Incredibly loyal.
As long as they're fed.

713
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:49,490
- Remember them?
- Eurystheus.

714
01:18:50,326 --> 01:18:52,828
They remember you.

715
01:18:53,029 --> 01:18:55,831
Confused, Hercules?

716
01:18:56,632 --> 01:19:02,104
Kingdoms are won with armies,
but empires are made by alliances.

717
01:19:02,204 --> 01:19:07,908
King Eurystheus and I will
now rule all of Greece.

718
01:19:13,883 --> 01:19:17,818
Cerberus only exists in my mind.

719
01:19:18,588 --> 01:19:21,422
Speak a little louder, Hercules.

720
01:19:21,991 --> 01:19:24,925
I didn't quite catch that.

721
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:28,429
The wolves.

722
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,800
They were there that night.

723
01:19:33,036 --> 01:19:37,404
<i>The wolves were there.</i>
<i>You drugged me.</i>

724
01:19:53,122 --> 01:19:56,757
<i>The wolves were there the
night my family was murdered.</i>

725
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:03,264
My men told me how
your children screamed

726
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:07,001
as my wolves gnawed on their bones.

727
01:20:08,471 --> 01:20:14,209
As their fangs despoiled your
daughter's... pure flesh.

728
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:18,147
When the people called out
your name louder than mine,

729
01:20:18,247 --> 01:20:22,447
you see, when they saw
you as a god, how long...

730
01:20:22,547 --> 01:20:25,654
- before they saw you as their king?
- I wanted nothing!

731
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:29,425
Precisely! Your sin, Hercules,
was that you had no ambition!

732
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:32,061
I can deal with an ambitious man!
He can be bought!

733
01:20:32,161 --> 01:20:35,930
But a man who wants
nothing has no price!

734
01:20:37,399 --> 01:20:40,670
Killing you would have
turned Athens against me.

735
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:42,903
I had to ruin your name.

736
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:48,409
My wife!

737
01:20:48,878 --> 01:20:50,212
My children!

738
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:53,449
Well, you have our permission
to join them in death.

739
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:58,354
All of you! Starting with
my faithless daughter!

740
01:20:58,454 --> 01:21:00,924
No! Get off me!

741
01:21:01,024 --> 01:21:06,062
No! No! No! Unhand me! No!

742
01:21:06,162 --> 01:21:07,764
She's your own flesh and blood!

743
01:21:07,864 --> 01:21:10,466
I will raise Arius to be
my worthy successor!

744
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:12,820
You stay away from my boy!

745
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:17,216
You monster, you bastard!
You are a monster!

746
01:21:17,316 --> 01:21:19,174
- You are a monster!
- No!

747
01:21:19,374 --> 01:21:22,979
You are not a man! You're a demon!

748
01:21:23,079 --> 01:21:25,381
Who are you?

749
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:26,516
Are you a murderer?

750
01:21:26,616 --> 01:21:29,218
Damn you! I curse you!

751
01:21:29,318 --> 01:21:31,654
Are you a mercenary who
turns his back on the innocent?

752
01:21:31,754 --> 01:21:33,289
Stay away from my son!

753
01:21:33,389 --> 01:21:38,428
Are you only the legend? Or are
you the truth behind the legend?

754
01:21:38,528 --> 01:21:40,696
No! Father, please, please, please.

755
01:21:40,796 --> 01:21:42,763
We believe in you.

756
01:21:43,032 --> 01:21:46,669
We have faith in you.
Have faith in yourself.

757
01:21:46,769 --> 01:21:47,737
Save me!

758
01:21:47,837 --> 01:21:49,572
Remember the man that you are.

759
01:21:49,672 --> 01:21:53,676
Father, the gods will punish you!
You cannot escape this time!

760
01:21:53,776 --> 01:21:55,845
Remember the deeds
you have performed,

761
01:21:55,945 --> 01:21:58,048
the Labors you have accomplished!

762
01:21:58,148 --> 01:21:59,916
No! No!

763
01:22:00,016 --> 01:22:01,784
- Stop it!
- Leave her alone!

764
01:22:01,884 --> 01:22:03,953
Now, tell me!

765
01:22:04,053 --> 01:22:07,957
- Please!
- Who are you?

766
01:22:08,057 --> 01:22:12,760
I am Hercules!

767
01:22:22,071 --> 01:22:25,439
Unleash the wolves!

768
01:22:29,178 --> 01:22:30,413
Get away!

769
01:22:30,513 --> 01:22:32,479
Ahh!

770
01:22:39,188 --> 01:22:42,756
Three wolves should be more
than enough for one lion.

771
01:22:45,528 --> 01:22:47,494
Hurry!

772
01:22:53,069 --> 01:22:55,002
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

773
01:22:56,940 --> 01:22:58,672
No!

774
01:23:09,886 --> 01:23:11,785
Ahh!

775
01:23:25,201 --> 01:23:27,370
The gods have revealed
your innocence.

776
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:30,339
The final Labor is complete.

777
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:32,807
But I'm just getting started.

778
01:23:40,248 --> 01:23:43,383
Doesn't take a vision to know
what's waiting for us up there.

779
01:24:12,281 --> 01:24:14,248
My time.

780
01:24:24,727 --> 01:24:27,130
Excuse me. That was
my moment, my fate.

781
01:24:27,230 --> 01:24:29,130
You're welcome.

782
01:24:41,477 --> 01:24:44,045
I'm going after Eurystheus!

783
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:08,070
Hercules, listen to me.
None of this is my fault.

784
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:12,183
You see, Cotys poisoned my mind.
Turned me against you.

785
01:25:12,883 --> 01:25:15,210
I like you. No, stop.

786
01:25:16,011 --> 01:25:19,348
I command you to stop! I'm your King!
You took an oath to obey me!

787
01:25:19,448 --> 01:25:23,418
You swore to Zeus! Wait, wait, wait.

788
01:25:23,919 --> 01:25:27,823
You fight for gold. I have plenty
of gold. Name your price.

789
01:25:27,923 --> 01:25:30,958
Find it in your heart to forgive.

790
01:25:35,798 --> 01:25:38,498
You want forgiveness?

791
01:25:53,783 --> 01:25:56,950
Ask my family for forgiveness.

792
01:26:14,737 --> 01:26:17,704
I've never killed a god before.

793
01:26:26,815 --> 01:26:29,816
I really think I'm
ready to fight now.

794
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,489
Well done, warrior.

795
01:26:46,969 --> 01:26:48,271
- Eurystheus?
- Dead.

796
01:26:48,371 --> 01:26:51,505
- We need to find Arius.
- Follow me.

797
01:27:05,721 --> 01:27:07,089
Soldiers of Thrace!

798
01:27:07,189 --> 01:27:11,461
You followed me in battle.
Follow me now.

799
01:27:11,561 --> 01:27:17,133
Don't be fools!
Hercules is mortal! Not a god!

800
01:27:17,233 --> 01:27:21,835
Anyone who sides with him will die!

801
01:27:22,171 --> 01:27:26,740
And I will show you. Bring him.

802
01:27:30,246 --> 01:27:31,747
- Arius!
- Mama!

803
01:27:31,847 --> 01:27:34,550
No! He's your grandson!

804
01:27:34,650 --> 01:27:37,186
You failed to save your
children, Hercules.

805
01:27:37,286 --> 01:27:39,555
But you may yet save him.

806
01:27:39,655 --> 01:27:41,224
Please, Father! No!

807
01:27:41,324 --> 01:27:45,759
Admit defeat! Bow to me!

808
01:27:45,995 --> 01:27:49,496
You have until the count of three!

809
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:52,801
One!

810
01:27:54,237 --> 01:27:55,171
Two!

811
01:27:58,307 --> 01:28:00,974
Don't just stand there! Kill someone!

812
01:28:02,011 --> 01:28:04,044
Protect Lord Cotys!

813
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:09,783
- Arius, run!
- Mother!

814
01:28:10,453 --> 01:28:12,119
Get the boy!

815
01:29:04,807 --> 01:29:07,307
Tydeus!

816
01:29:09,645 --> 01:29:12,048
Attack!

817
01:29:12,148 --> 01:29:14,347
Hold them back!

818
01:29:29,432 --> 01:29:31,731
Spears!

819
01:29:36,238 --> 01:29:38,572
Go through the fire!

820
01:29:43,512 --> 01:29:46,880
Here! Here! Help! Come on!

821
01:29:50,553 --> 01:29:52,588
Easy, Tydeus.

822
01:30:22,785 --> 01:30:24,484
Hercules.

823
01:30:44,640 --> 01:30:46,840
Lock shields!

824
01:30:47,410 --> 01:30:49,376
March!

825
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:53,713
Find peace, my brother.

826
01:31:08,830 --> 01:31:14,537
As you said, Hercules, there is
no way to defeat a shield wall!

827
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:17,104
There is no way out!

828
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:20,640
Come out and face me!

829
01:31:27,182 --> 01:31:30,653
You're no hero! You're no god!

830
01:31:30,753 --> 01:31:33,488
You're nothing but a mercenary!

831
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:37,357
Your wife and children
deserved to die!

832
01:31:58,981 --> 01:32:01,951
What're you doing? Get back up there!

833
01:32:02,051 --> 01:32:05,152
Hercules must die!

834
01:32:07,923 --> 01:32:09,423
Come on!

835
01:32:11,060 --> 01:32:15,395
Kill that filthy bastard!

836
01:33:14,323 --> 01:33:17,726
Hercules! Hercules!

837
01:33:17,826 --> 01:33:21,230
Hercules! Hercules!

838
01:33:21,330 --> 01:33:26,735
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

839
01:33:26,835 --> 01:33:30,339
Hercules! Hercules!

840
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:35,644
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

841
01:33:35,744 --> 01:33:40,615
Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

842
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:43,852
<i>You want to know the
truth about Hercules?</i>

843
01:33:43,952 --> 01:33:46,288
<i>There it is.</i>

844
01:33:46,388 --> 01:33:50,158
<i>To be honest, I prefer
it to the legend.</i>

845
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:54,429
<i>The world needs a hero
they can believe in.</i>

846
01:33:54,730 --> 01:33:58,033
<i>Is he actually the son of Zeus?</i>

847
01:33:58,133 --> 01:34:00,935
<i>I don't think it really matters.</i>

848
01:34:01,236 --> 01:34:04,839
<i>You don't need to be a
demigod to be a hero.</i>

849
01:34:04,940 --> 01:34:08,209
<i>You just need to
believe you're a hero.</i>

850
01:34:08,410 --> 01:34:11,678
<i>It's what worked for him.</i>

851
01:34:12,414 --> 01:34:17,318
<i>But then again,
what the hell do I know?</i>

852
01:34:17,519 --> 01:34:20,854
<i>I'm supposed to be dead by now.</i>

853
01:34:21,305 --> 01:35:21,334
