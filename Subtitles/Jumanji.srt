2
00:00:53,138 --> 00:00:57,517
Don't worry. It's just a pack of wolves.
Come on, we're almost rid of it.

3
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,829
- Caleb, it's after me!
- Grab on!

4
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,249
Run! Run!

5
00:01:20,415 --> 00:01:22,668
No, Benjamin, we have to finish this.

6
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:25,212
Come on, help me bury it.

7
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:30,509
What if someone digs it up?

8
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:36,556
May God have mercy on his soul.

9
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,717
- Hi, Alan.
- Hi, Miss Magruder.

10
00:02:11,883 --> 00:02:14,428
- Afternoon, Alan.
- Hey, Frank.

11
00:02:22,394 --> 00:02:25,063
- All yours, Alan.
- Thanks, Bill.

12
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:40,912
Get him!

13
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:49,713
Prepare to die, Parrish!

14
00:02:51,423 --> 00:02:53,759
Hey, Parrish, what's the rush?

15
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,434
He's going to his dad's factory!

16
00:03:04,394 --> 00:03:07,356
He's going to Daddy now.

17
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:22,788
Go on, Parrish! Run to Daddy.

18
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,039
We'll be waiting.

19
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:45,936
Hey, Carl.

20
00:03:46,103 --> 00:03:49,773
Hey, Alan, my man. I gotta
show you something. Come here.

21
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,192
Now, I've been working on this
for almost a year.

22
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:54,653
And I got an appointment
with your father...

23
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:58,073
...to show him this.
Go ahead, take it.

24
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,160
So, what do you think?
You think he'll like it?

25
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:04,579
What is it?

26
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:09,167
What is it? This is the future. If I can get
Wilt Chamberlain to wear them...

27
00:04:09,334 --> 00:04:12,712
...there will be a pair of those
in every closet in America.

28
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,923
That's gonna be the height of fashion.

29
00:04:17,551 --> 00:04:19,052
What's wrong?

30
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:22,931
- Nothing.
- Alan!

31
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,518
Thanks, Bob. What are you doing here?

32
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:29,896
I've told you, this factory isn't
a playground. It's dangerous.

33
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:31,690
Dad, can I have a ride home?

34
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,400
Oh, Alan.

35
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:36,445
Is Billy Jessup picking on you again?

36
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:41,283
Son, you're gonna have
to face him sooner or later.

37
00:04:42,534 --> 00:04:46,246
Look, if you're afraid of something,
you've got to stand and face it.

38
00:04:46,413 --> 00:04:47,873
Now, run on, son.

39
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,419
Carl, you know better
than to let the boy play in here.

40
00:04:52,586 --> 00:04:54,254
Sorry, sir.

41
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:56,882
Oh, what was it
you wanted to show me?

42
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:58,884
Just a minute, sir.

43
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,019
What the devil...?

44
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:13,231
Get an extinguisher.
Bring it over here.

45
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,026
What is that?

46
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:25,494
Who did this?

47
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:27,704
Well?

48
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,001
I did, sir.

49
00:05:46,806 --> 00:05:50,477
Being a Parrish doesn't mean
you can hang around with my girlfriend.

50
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:52,437
We're just friends.

51
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,105
Not anymore.

52
00:05:54,689 --> 00:05:56,358
Get him!

53
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,155
- Let's go.
- Okay, I've got his bike!

54
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:10,121
Jerks!

55
00:08:56,788 --> 00:08:58,456
Neat.

56
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:06,965
Alan?

57
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,592
Are you home?

58
00:09:15,807 --> 00:09:20,311
Oh, Alan, not again. Come on.

59
00:09:23,356 --> 00:09:26,192
Hard work, determination,
cheerful outlook...

60
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:28,820
...attributes that have exemplified
the Brantford spirit...

61
00:09:28,987 --> 00:09:32,741
...since our forefathers
first settled this town.

62
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:37,162
Despite the harshness of our native clime
and the granite of our soil...

63
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,955
...we have...

64
00:09:39,497 --> 00:09:42,167
- Prospered.
- I knew the whole thing this morning.

65
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,461
You'll know the whole darn thing tonight.

66
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:48,673
- Right. Let's go.
- Sam, we have to talk to Alan.

67
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:57,849
Well, we're on our way.

68
00:09:58,016 --> 00:09:59,142
Okay.

69
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:03,521
I told your father what you told me this
afternoon, that it wasn't just Billy Jessup.

70
00:10:03,688 --> 00:10:07,984
- Look, if I'd known that, I wouldn't have...
- It's okay, Dad.

71
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:10,111
But I'm proud of you.

72
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:13,072
You faced them,
even though you were outnumbered.

73
00:10:13,239 --> 00:10:18,036
And, since you took it like a man,
your mother and I have decided...

74
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:21,372
...that you're ready to go
to the Cliffside School for Boys.

75
00:10:21,539 --> 00:10:24,042
- There.
- Congratulations, sweetheart.

76
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:28,755
You don't want me living here anymore?

77
00:10:28,922 --> 00:10:30,381
Alan.

78
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,718
It's always been the plan
that you'd go to Cliffside.

79
00:10:33,885 --> 00:10:38,097
I mean, Parrishes have been going
to Cliffside ever since the 1700s.

80
00:10:38,264 --> 00:10:40,266
Even your Uncle Skylar went there.

81
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,144
Look at this. Parrish Hall?

82
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:44,896
It's the main dormitory.

83
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:52,445
This is great. Kids are on my case here
because I'm a Parrish.

84
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:56,115
Just wait till I'm living
in a building named after me.

85
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,618
It was named after my father.

86
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,079
Good. Why don't you live in it?

87
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:05,250
I did. I wouldn't be who I am today
if it weren't for my years there.

88
00:11:06,292 --> 00:11:08,628
Maybe I don't want to be who you are.

89
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:10,630
Maybe I don't even want
to be a Parrish.

90
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:15,927
You won't be.
Not till you start acting like one.

91
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:18,137
- Sam...
- Get your coat.

92
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:24,769
I guess I'm not ready for Cliffside, then.

93
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:29,566
We're taking you there next Sunday!
And I don't want to hear another word!

94
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:30,942
You won't!

95
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:33,987
I'm never talking to you again!

96
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,327
- Sam...
- Don't.

97
00:11:41,494 --> 00:11:43,830
- Sam.
- What?

98
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:45,290
Nothing. Just...

99
00:12:12,108 --> 00:12:13,401
What are you doing here?

100
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:15,987
I brought your bike back.

101
00:12:16,154 --> 00:12:17,822
You didn't have to.

102
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:20,074
I was going over
to Billy's to get it myself.

103
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:23,328
I told Billy to stop picking on you.

104
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:28,041
You shouldn't have wasted your breath.
We gotta talk about this some other time.

105
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,335
What was that?

106
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:35,006
- You heard it too?
- Of course I heard it.

107
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:39,510
Come on. I found
this really weird game in the factory.

108
00:12:39,677 --> 00:12:41,512
A game?

109
00:12:58,363 --> 00:12:59,530
"Jumanji.

110
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:04,202
A game for those who seek to find
a way to leave their world behind.

111
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:07,997
You roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles gets another turn.

112
00:13:08,164 --> 00:13:11,209
The first player to reach the end wins."
You wanna play?

113
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,046
I quit playing board games
five years ago.

114
00:13:18,675 --> 00:13:20,218
Sarah!

115
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,393
It's gotta be magnetized or something.

116
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:29,811
Alan, look.

117
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:35,650
"At night they fly, you better run.

118
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:40,238
These winged things are not much fun."

119
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:47,745
What was that?

120
00:13:48,496 --> 00:13:50,081
I don't know.

121
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:53,084
- Put it away, Alan.
- Okay.

122
00:14:00,508 --> 00:14:01,843
Oh, no.

123
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,594
The game thinks I rolled.

124
00:14:04,387 --> 00:14:06,764
What do you mean, "the game thinks"?

125
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,769
"In the jungle you must wait...

126
00:14:12,311 --> 00:14:15,231
...until the dice read five or eight."

127
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:20,653
"In the jungle you must wait"?
What does that mean?

128
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:38,546
Sarah!

129
00:14:38,713 --> 00:14:42,216
Roll the dice!

130
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:44,177
Sarah!

131
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,008
I think a bed-and-breakfast is just
what this town needs.

132
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:27,929
Well, it was pretty hard to pass up.
Especially full of furniture.

133
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:29,305
Oh, boy.

134
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:32,100
I keep forgetting
how big this place is.

135
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,811
Judy, Peter, come look at this.

136
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:38,022
I'm gonna put a reception area
right over here.

137
00:15:39,023 --> 00:15:41,526
And a bar over here in the parlor.

138
00:15:45,363 --> 00:15:47,156
That sounds lovely.

139
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:50,076
I'm sure you and your kids
are gonna be very happy here.

140
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,036
Well...

141
00:15:52,203 --> 00:15:54,705
Actually, they're my late brother's.

142
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,708
He and his wife passed away
just last winter.

143
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:03,548
Is this something, or what?

144
00:16:05,049 --> 00:16:06,884
It sure is.

145
00:16:21,107 --> 00:16:24,068
So, what do you think, young man?
Is it big enough for you?

146
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:39,125
Peter hasn't spoken a word
since it happened.

147
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:42,628
Oh, my.

148
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:45,923
I'm so sorry. How terribly awful.

149
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:48,342
It's okay.

150
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:52,138
We barely even knew our parents.
They were always away.

151
00:16:52,305 --> 00:16:55,516
Skiing in St. Moritz,
gambling in Monte Carlo...

152
00:16:55,683 --> 00:16:59,353
...safariing in darkest Africa.

153
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,440
We didn't even know if they loved us.

154
00:17:02,982 --> 00:17:06,027
But when the sheik's yacht went down...

155
00:17:06,194 --> 00:17:08,946
...they managed to write us
a beautiful goodbye note...

156
00:17:09,113 --> 00:17:13,242
...that was found floating in
a champagne bottle amongst the debris.

157
00:17:14,118 --> 00:17:15,203
Excuse me.

158
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:26,964
They were very devoted parents.
It was a car crash in Canada.

159
00:17:27,131 --> 00:17:30,301
- So you'll send me those escrow papers?
- First thing tomorrow.

160
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,086
I'll have to get a locksmith out
for this one.

161
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:08,172
Peter, pick up your toys, please.

162
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:17,890
Peter, take this suitcase up to the attic.

163
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:21,769
Then we can all have ice cream.
And bourbon.

164
00:18:48,504 --> 00:18:50,798
What? What is it?

165
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,384
I'm going to Motel 6.

166
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:55,761
Oh, for heaven's sake.

167
00:19:21,871 --> 00:19:24,332
I don't see any guano.

168
00:19:28,544 --> 00:19:30,004
He said it looked like that.

169
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:35,092
That's an African bat. Some kid said
she saw some back in the '60s...

170
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,596
...but we don't get bats
like that in New England.

171
00:19:38,763 --> 00:19:39,930
That's what he saw.

172
00:19:40,097 --> 00:19:44,435
Well, whatever it was, it's gone now.

173
00:19:45,019 --> 00:19:49,315
Bats aren't what I'd worry about
in this house, anyways.

174
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:51,108
What would you worry about?

175
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,069
Well, personally...

176
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,864
...I wouldn't wanna live in a house
where someone was murdered.

177
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:00,284
- Murdered?
- Yep.

178
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:03,496
Little Alan Parrish.
I say his father did it.

179
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:09,085
There's 1001 places he could've hid
the body in this house.

180
00:20:09,668 --> 00:20:12,338
Especially if he chopped it up first.

181
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,548
Hey up there!

182
00:20:14,715 --> 00:20:18,052
You kids don't wanna be late
for your first day of school.

183
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:24,517
- Not a bat in sight, ma'am.
- Do you hear that?

184
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:28,646
There is nothing to be afraid of
in this house.

185
00:20:54,505 --> 00:20:58,175
I can't believe I have to see
your principal after the first day.

186
00:20:58,342 --> 00:20:59,927
What am I gonna do?

187
00:21:02,346 --> 00:21:04,432
Now, let's just try to relax
and finish dinner.

188
00:21:05,099 --> 00:21:07,017
Talk about something else.

189
00:21:07,476 --> 00:21:09,520
We found out why you got
this house so cheap.

190
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:13,816
Twenty-six years ago, a kid named
Alan Parrish used to live here.

191
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:16,444
Then one day, he just disappeared.

192
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:20,531
Because his parents chopped him up
in little pieces and hid him in the walls.

193
00:21:20,698 --> 00:21:24,535
Okay, that's it. I am sick and tired
of your lies, young lady. You're grounded.

194
00:21:27,913 --> 00:21:31,625
Fine, there's nowhere to go
in this stupid town anyway.

195
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:35,754
But just for your information,
that wasn't a lie.

196
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,460
Did you hear anything a little while ago?

197
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,175
Do you miss Mom and Dad?

198
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,220
No.

199
00:22:24,762 --> 00:22:25,763
Liar.

200
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,433
If you don't cut that out,
they'll send you to a shrink.

201
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,270
Where do you think they're gonna
send you if you don't start talking?

202
00:22:51,288 --> 00:22:53,916
If I get held up at
the permit office, I'll call.

203
00:22:54,083 --> 00:22:56,627
The school bus should be here
any minute.

204
00:22:59,588 --> 00:23:01,298
You guys still have your house keys?

205
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:04,385
Are you guys listening to me?

206
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,263
Hello?

207
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:09,974
Hello?

208
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,392
What?

209
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:15,521
Maybe I should wait with you
till the bus comes.

210
00:23:16,063 --> 00:23:18,857
Did your parents used
to put you on the bus?

211
00:23:19,483 --> 00:23:21,193
No... No.

212
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,028
Are you sure?

213
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:25,155
I could drop you off.

214
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:29,243
No, don't worry about us.
The bus will be here any minute.

215
00:23:29,702 --> 00:23:33,247
Okay. Please be good today.

216
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:44,174
You do hear it.

217
00:23:44,675 --> 00:23:46,510
Hear what?

218
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:03,527
Where's it coming from?

219
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,854
Let's bring it over here.

220
00:24:51,158 --> 00:24:53,243
Weird. They're stuck.

221
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:56,330
"Jumanji, a game for those
who seek to find...

222
00:24:56,497 --> 00:24:58,457
...a way to leave their world behind.

223
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:01,335
Roll the dice to move your token.
Doubles get another turn.

224
00:25:01,502 --> 00:25:03,587
The first player to reach the end wins."

225
00:25:10,177 --> 00:25:12,763
It's gotta be microchips or something.

226
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,600
You go first.

227
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:19,561
Okay.

228
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,358
Six.

229
00:25:37,663 --> 00:25:41,625
"A tiny bite can make you itch,
make you sneeze, make you twitch."

230
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,914
Don't!

231
00:26:26,128 --> 00:26:28,505
"This will not be an easy mission.

232
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:31,258
Monkeys slow the expedition."

233
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:36,346
What is that?

234
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,057
I bet those monkeys came
from the game.

235
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,226
The mosquitoes too.

236
00:27:25,604 --> 00:27:27,898
I didn't see this part.

237
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:33,153
"Adventurers, beware."

238
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:43,413
"Adventurers, beware. Do not begin
unless you intend to finish.

239
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,666
The exciting consequences
of the game...

240
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:49,419
...will vanish only when a player has
reached Jumanji and called out its name."

241
00:27:49,586 --> 00:27:51,755
- The monkeys are gone.
- Good.

242
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:53,924
- Put it away.
- Wait!

243
00:27:54,091 --> 00:27:56,593
If we finish the game, it'll all go away.

244
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,054
We'd better do it,
or Aunt Nora will pitch a fit.

245
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:03,475
We should just get through it quickly.
I mean, there's no skill involved.

246
00:28:05,269 --> 00:28:07,354
No, you rolled doubles.

247
00:28:07,521 --> 00:28:09,231
You get another turn.

248
00:28:09,398 --> 00:28:10,941
Roll.

249
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,277
Five.

250
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:20,826
"His fangs are sharp.
He likes your taste.

251
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:25,330
Your party better move posthaste."

252
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,041
I don't like the sound of that.

253
00:28:30,544 --> 00:28:32,004
Judy, someone's in here.

254
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:56,653
It's not real, Peter. It's a hallucination.

255
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:02,492
Run, Peter!

256
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,004
I'm back.

257
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,012
My bike.

258
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:33,643
Somebody roll a five or an eight?

259
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:36,897
He did.

260
00:31:44,529 --> 00:31:46,907
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

261
00:31:47,074 --> 00:31:49,785
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

262
00:31:49,951 --> 00:31:50,994
Thank you.

263
00:31:51,161 --> 00:31:54,122
Sorry if I scared you.
Sorry if I scared you.

264
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:55,332
Thank you.

265
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:57,000
I'm back!

266
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:59,503
Mom! Dad!

267
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm home!

268
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:06,426
I'm back!

269
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:10,680
It's me! It's me, Alan, Mom and Dad!

270
00:32:10,847 --> 00:32:14,643
I'm home! I'm back!

271
00:32:15,018 --> 00:32:17,187
Are you my little sister?

272
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,231
No.

273
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,191
I'm Judy and he's Peter.

274
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:23,860
Where's Mom? Is Dad at the factory?

275
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:26,571
Are you...

276
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:28,698
...Alan Parrish?

277
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,868
Yeah. Who are you?

278
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:33,870
We live here now.

279
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:37,040
Where's my mom and dad?

280
00:32:37,666 --> 00:32:39,042
We don't know.

281
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:43,296
This house has been empty for years.

282
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:46,299
Everyone thought you were dead.

283
00:32:57,352 --> 00:32:58,645
Sorry.

284
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:04,067
...Said they're about 2 feet tall,
red fur, long tail.

285
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,987
- Give me that description again.
- Red fur and long tail.

286
00:33:17,247 --> 00:33:22,085
Get down off of my car, please,
and get up on the sidewalk.

287
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:27,090
- What year is it?
- It was brand-new.

288
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:32,512
- No. What year is it?
- 1995, remember?

289
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:34,639
- Ninety-five...
- You got some ID?

290
00:33:34,806 --> 00:33:37,934
Let me guess,
it's in your other Tarzan outfit, right?

291
00:33:38,101 --> 00:33:40,937
- Twenty-six years.
- Are you from around here?

292
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:42,647
I was.

293
00:33:42,814 --> 00:33:44,316
But I've been in Jumanji.

294
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:47,194
Indonesia. He was in the Peace Corps.

295
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:57,746
- Carl Bentley, the Sole Man.
- Is this man related to you?

296
00:33:57,913 --> 00:34:01,791
- Yes, sir, he's our uncle.
- Does he always dress like that?

297
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:04,794
Well, yeah, he's a vegetarian.

298
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:07,005
Get out of there!

299
00:34:12,761 --> 00:34:15,639
Monkeys. Monkeys.

300
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,308
Is he all right upstairs?

301
00:34:19,226 --> 00:34:22,520
He suffered a head injury
a few months ago.

302
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,993
Don't you move!

303
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,579
Thief! Hey!

304
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,665
- Stop! Stop!
- Don't move, don't move.

305
00:34:42,332 --> 00:34:44,167
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?

306
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:46,753
To find my parents!

307
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,422
Come on.

308
00:35:16,199 --> 00:35:17,617
Wait!

309
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:14,924
My dad used to make shoes here.

310
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,511
They were the best shoes
in New England.

311
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:23,183
Hey!

312
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,107
Sorry.

313
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,112
Easy, girl.

314
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,786
Do you know what happened
to the shoe factory?

315
00:36:43,953 --> 00:36:48,333
Yeah, it folded up.
Like everything else in this town.

316
00:36:48,792 --> 00:36:52,170
It's pretty cold out there.
How about some coffee?

317
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:55,507
Why would they close Parrish Shoes?

318
00:36:56,257 --> 00:37:00,720
When his kid ran away, Sam put
everything he had into trying to find him.

319
00:37:00,887 --> 00:37:02,847
His time, his money...

320
00:37:03,014 --> 00:37:04,516
Everything.

321
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:08,144
After a while, he stopped coming to work.

322
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:10,522
He just quit caring.

323
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:15,902
I don't think anybody loved his boy
more than Sam did.

324
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:18,947
Here.

325
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,535
You're gonna freeze out there.

326
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:28,832
Thank you.
Are the Parrishes still around?

327
00:37:29,707 --> 00:37:32,836
- I see them now and then.
- Yeah?

328
00:37:33,878 --> 00:37:35,588
They're over on Adams Street.

329
00:37:54,524 --> 00:37:56,818
Our parents are dead too.

330
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:02,449
They were in the Middle East
negotiating peace when...

331
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:11,249
Our dad was in advertising.

332
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,211
Bet you miss him, huh?

333
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:17,380
Me too.

334
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:23,636
There he goes again.

335
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:29,601
Listen, I know you're upset and all,
but we should finish the game.

336
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,978
We? Why do you need me?

337
00:38:32,145 --> 00:38:35,106
Well, just in case
any other scary stuff comes out.

338
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:37,901
Plus there's a lion in my aunt's bedroom.

339
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:39,903
Do I look like a Ringling Brother?

340
00:38:40,528 --> 00:38:41,696
She'll be home soon.

341
00:38:41,863 --> 00:38:45,575
Won't she be surprised?
I hope she's not allergic to cats.

342
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:03,510
Larry, we need the wheels.
Give me a hand.

343
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:08,640
- Did we hit her that hard?
- No, it looks like another weird bite.

344
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:19,817
- Yeah, it's another one, all right.
- Jeez, over 50. What the hell's going on?

345
00:39:20,151 --> 00:39:21,861
- Easy, now. Easy.
- Hey, look.

346
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,113
- Isn't that Mrs. Thomas?
- Who's that?

347
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,407
- The Realtor.
- Quiet.

348
00:39:26,574 --> 00:39:27,992
Listen.

349
00:39:28,451 --> 00:39:29,744
You hear that?

350
00:39:29,911 --> 00:39:31,621
Hear what?

351
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:33,790
Get in the car.

352
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:43,383
Okay, think. What came out
of the game before me?

353
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,928
There was a lion,
a bunch of monkeys and...

354
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,596
That!

355
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:55,228
It's okay, it's okay.
It's just a bug, but we're safe in here.

356
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:57,146
See? We're fine.

357
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,194
As long as we stay low,
he can't get through there too far, okay?

358
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,905
Don't you worry. We're fine.

359
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:09,200
Okay. He can't get us in here.
He can't get through the glass.

360
00:40:09,909 --> 00:40:11,536
We're safe.

361
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:16,374
Either one of you know how to drive?

362
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:18,501
No? Well, that's no problem.

363
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:21,879
My dad used to let me
back the car down the driveway.

364
00:40:22,046 --> 00:40:23,590
Once.

365
00:40:24,007 --> 00:40:25,341
So, what's the big deal?

366
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:27,176
- Buckle up.
- Here we go!

367
00:40:31,848 --> 00:40:34,350
Wait a minute. What? Wait.

368
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:41,441
Alan, the top!

369
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,668
Piece of cake.

370
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:03,880
Yeah.

371
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,437
Alan.

372
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:23,983
Keep that thing away from me!

373
00:41:25,318 --> 00:41:27,236
When are you gonna help us play?

374
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:30,114
We've gotta hurry.
Our aunt's gonna be home soon.

375
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:34,452
Well, good. You can inform her
that she's the ex-owner of this house.

376
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,582
I hope you realize, with my parents gone,
this home belongs to me.

377
00:41:42,418 --> 00:41:44,837
Oh, thank you.

378
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,757
No more banana leaves.

379
00:41:47,924 --> 00:41:48,966
Yes.

380
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:58,351
What do you think those monkeys
are gonna do to the ecosystem?

381
00:41:59,977 --> 00:42:01,729
Hello?

382
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,555
What happened to you?
You shave with a piece of glass?

383
00:42:35,722 --> 00:42:39,100
What happened to you?
The Clampetts have a yard sale?

384
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:41,811
What do you want?
I've never shaved before.

385
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:43,813
Where are you going?

386
00:42:44,605 --> 00:42:48,901
How about Peter and I play,
and you just sort of watch?

387
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:50,486
Thanks, I've seen it.

388
00:42:51,738 --> 00:42:54,657
So if you're not gonna help us,
what are you gonna do?

389
00:42:54,824 --> 00:42:58,286
I don't know.
Pretty much take up where I left off.

390
00:42:58,453 --> 00:43:01,497
I wonder if Mrs. Niedermeyer's
still teaching sixth grade.

391
00:43:11,048 --> 00:43:13,843
Come on, Judy, he's not gonna help us.
He's afraid.

392
00:43:14,844 --> 00:43:16,763
What did you say?

393
00:43:18,181 --> 00:43:20,850
You're afraid. It's okay to be afraid.

394
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:26,856
Let's go set it up in the living room.

395
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,695
You have no idea
what you're getting yourself into.

396
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:36,199
Whatever it is, we'll handle it
by ourselves. We don't need your help.

397
00:43:36,365 --> 00:43:39,035
I don't think so.

398
00:43:39,577 --> 00:43:43,623
You think monkeys,
mosquitoes and lions are bad?

399
00:43:43,790 --> 00:43:45,750
That's just the beginning.

400
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:50,171
I've seen things you've only seen
in your nightmares.

401
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:53,216
Things you can't even imagine.

402
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:56,427
Things you can't even see.

403
00:43:56,886 --> 00:44:00,765
There are things
that hunt you in the night.

404
00:44:00,932 --> 00:44:05,228
Then something screams.
Then you hear them eating.

405
00:44:05,645 --> 00:44:08,940
And you hope to God
that you're not dessert.

406
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:11,651
Afraid?

407
00:44:11,943 --> 00:44:14,946
You don't even know what afraid is.

408
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:18,074
You will not last five minutes without me.

409
00:44:18,741 --> 00:44:20,368
So...

410
00:44:20,827 --> 00:44:22,995
...you're gonna help us?

411
00:44:25,373 --> 00:44:27,291
I'll watch...

412
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:33,464
...but I'm not afraid.

413
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:46,352
Peter, that was very cool.

414
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:50,940
It's reverse psychology.
Dad used to pull it on me all the time.

415
00:44:51,524 --> 00:44:53,192
Ready?

416
00:44:53,651 --> 00:44:55,111
Yeah.

417
00:44:55,903 --> 00:44:57,488
Alan, ready?

418
00:44:57,655 --> 00:44:59,657
There is no "ready."

419
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,710
I'll try it again.

420
00:45:19,677 --> 00:45:21,220
Alan, it's not working.

421
00:45:30,187 --> 00:45:31,647
Oh, no.

422
00:45:31,814 --> 00:45:33,149
It's not your turn.

423
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:36,819
Yeah, I rolled first. Then Peter twice
because he got doubles.

424
00:45:36,986 --> 00:45:38,237
Now it's my turn again.

425
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,159
No, look.
Two of those pieces are yours, right?

426
00:45:43,326 --> 00:45:44,660
Who's the other pieces?

427
00:45:48,706 --> 00:45:50,958
The elephant was mine.

428
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:56,339
You're playing the game
I started in 1969.

429
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,051
I'm gonna have to play.

430
00:46:04,347 --> 00:46:06,223
It's not my turn.

431
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:09,018
Whose turn is it?

432
00:46:12,563 --> 00:46:15,358
Sarah Whittle.

433
00:46:22,531 --> 00:46:25,117
This is where she used to live.

434
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:28,704
This place gives me the creeps.

435
00:46:39,548 --> 00:46:42,093
We used to play on this porch.

436
00:46:44,929 --> 00:46:46,889
I knew she still wouldn't live here.

437
00:46:47,056 --> 00:46:49,600
Probably married Billy Jessup
and living in a trailer park.

438
00:46:49,767 --> 00:46:51,268
- Come on.
- Let's at least ask.

439
00:46:51,435 --> 00:46:55,564
- Maybe she'll know where Sarah went.
- Of course she'll know. She's a psychic.

440
00:46:55,731 --> 00:46:57,316
Good point.

441
00:47:00,403 --> 00:47:02,405
I remember the porch being a lot bigger.

442
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:04,115
Hello?

443
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:07,910
- Can you help us?
- Do you have an appointment?

444
00:47:08,077 --> 00:47:12,248
- No, we're just trying to find someone.
- Madam Serena can't see anyone now.

445
00:47:12,415 --> 00:47:14,583
Well, maybe you can help us.

446
00:47:18,212 --> 00:47:19,755
What is it?

447
00:47:19,922 --> 00:47:22,133
We're looking for someone
who used to live here.

448
00:47:22,675 --> 00:47:24,802
No, I've lived here my whole life.

449
00:47:24,969 --> 00:47:27,346
Well, then you must know Sarah Whittle.

450
00:47:32,184 --> 00:47:34,311
What do you want with Sarah Whittle?

451
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:37,481
Sarah?

452
00:47:39,108 --> 00:47:41,736
No, I don't go by that name anymore.

453
00:47:42,778 --> 00:47:44,780
Sarah Whittle?

454
00:47:45,489 --> 00:47:47,033
What do you want?

455
00:47:48,993 --> 00:47:53,789
Twenty-six years ago, you played a game
with a little boy down the street.

456
00:47:55,624 --> 00:47:58,127
A game with drums.

457
00:48:02,673 --> 00:48:04,008
How do you know that?

458
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,554
I was that little boy, Sarah.

459
00:48:11,557 --> 00:48:13,309
Alan?

460
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:22,485
You killed her.

461
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:26,447
Leave a message
and the doctor will call you back...

462
00:48:26,614 --> 00:48:28,991
...at his earliest convenience.

463
00:48:29,366 --> 00:48:33,829
Dr. Boorstein, it's Sarah Whittle. Listen,
if you could call me as soon as you can.

464
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:36,832
I think I need to have
my dosage checked.

465
00:48:36,999 --> 00:48:40,669
That event we've been discussing,
the one that didn't really happen?

466
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:43,089
Oh, boy.
I'm having an episode here today...

467
00:48:43,255 --> 00:48:45,841
...with the little boy
that didn't really disappear.

468
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:48,844
I'm sitting in his living room,
drinking lemonade.

469
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:52,473
If you could call me, I'd really be
interested in your interpretation.

470
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,266
Thank you so much.

471
00:48:54,433 --> 00:48:57,186
- He'll call me back.
- While we're waiting...

472
00:48:58,437 --> 00:48:59,897
- God! No, no, no!
- Sarah. Sarah.

473
00:49:00,064 --> 00:49:02,233
- Oh, no, no, no.
- It's okay. Sarah. Please.

474
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:06,278
I have spent over 2000 hours in therapy
convincing myself that that doesn't exist.

475
00:49:06,445 --> 00:49:09,073
What happened to you was so awful,
I made up this thing...

476
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:11,534
Sarah, it was awful. It was awful.

477
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:13,119
It was awful, it really was.

478
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:16,705
But it was real. Real.

479
00:49:16,872 --> 00:49:21,043
No, no, it wasn't real, Alan. Your father
murdered you, and he chopped you up.

480
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,504
Sarah, come on.

481
00:49:23,671 --> 00:49:25,881
My dad did that?

482
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:29,510
My father could barely hug me...

483
00:49:29,677 --> 00:49:32,596
...let alone cut me into little pieces.

484
00:49:33,055 --> 00:49:38,060
Twenty-six years ago,
we started playing a little game.

485
00:49:38,227 --> 00:49:39,520
And now...

486
00:49:39,687 --> 00:49:44,150
...we're all gonna sit down
and we're gonna finish it.

487
00:49:44,316 --> 00:49:46,193
And guess what.

488
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:48,028
It's your turn.

489
00:49:53,284 --> 00:49:54,743
No.

490
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:56,662
Here.

491
00:49:58,664 --> 00:49:59,915
Play the game, Sarah.

492
00:50:00,249 --> 00:50:02,918
- Oh, no, no.
- Fine.

493
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:08,841
Just give me the dice and you can
go home. You don't have to play.

494
00:50:09,008 --> 00:50:10,759
Thank you, Alan.

495
00:50:12,219 --> 00:50:14,638
Oh, my God! How could you do that?

496
00:50:14,972 --> 00:50:17,933
It's the law of the jungle, Sarah.
You'll get used to it.

497
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:22,188
When I think of all the energy I spent
visualizing you as a radiant spirit...

498
00:50:22,354 --> 00:50:23,939
Go on, read it.

499
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:31,614
"They grow much faster than bamboo.

500
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:34,617
Take care or they'll come after you."

501
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:38,537
Oh, great.

502
00:50:39,163 --> 00:50:42,499
Oh, God. Tell me this isn't happening.

503
00:50:42,666 --> 00:50:46,045
Oh, it is. Stay away from the walls.
Don't touch anything.

504
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,299
No quick movements.

505
00:50:55,763 --> 00:50:58,015
- They're beautiful.
- Oh, yeah, they're beautiful.

506
00:50:58,182 --> 00:51:01,310
Don't touch the purple ones.
They shoot poisonous barbs.

507
00:51:01,644 --> 00:51:05,689
And definitely stay away from the pods.
The big yellow ones.

508
00:51:06,148 --> 00:51:07,399
What big yellow ones?

509
00:51:11,403 --> 00:51:13,364
Peter!

510
00:51:13,530 --> 00:51:15,366
I got you! Get his arms!

511
00:51:15,532 --> 00:51:17,660
Get it off me! Get it off me!

512
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,378
Oh, my God!

513
00:51:34,343 --> 00:51:37,638
- Hang on, boy.
- Got him? I'll be right back.

514
00:51:37,805 --> 00:51:39,348
Oh, my God.

515
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,517
Sorry, Angus.

516
00:51:46,855 --> 00:51:47,898
Harvest time!

517
00:51:56,073 --> 00:51:57,658
Are you okay?

518
00:51:57,825 --> 00:51:59,243
Peter.

519
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,543
Oh, my God!

520
00:52:08,544 --> 00:52:12,256
My car. Oh, my car.

521
00:52:12,423 --> 00:52:13,549
Carl, come in, please.

522
00:52:13,882 --> 00:52:16,135
Come in, please, Carl.
Has anybody seen Carl?

523
00:52:16,302 --> 00:52:20,431
I can't believe this.
Start, start, please. Yes!

524
00:52:20,597 --> 00:52:23,892
- Carl? Come in, Carl.
- Carl here.

525
00:52:24,059 --> 00:52:27,688
Where in heaven's name have you been?
We've got an Animal Control situation.

526
00:52:27,855 --> 00:52:29,189
Get Stan and Willy on it.

527
00:52:29,356 --> 00:52:33,569
I'm heading over to the old Parrish place
to check out a suspicious character.

528
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,655
I should've been a fireman.

529
00:52:44,705 --> 00:52:45,748
Yeah.

530
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:47,207
Sarah!

531
00:52:50,586 --> 00:52:51,754
Get your hands off me!

532
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,757
- The game is not over yet, Sarah.
- Well, it is for me.

533
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:56,759
You are not in the jungle anymore.

534
00:52:56,925 --> 00:53:00,220
Stop this!
You don't treat people like this.

535
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:08,103
Okay.

536
00:53:14,443 --> 00:53:17,780
Anybody up for iced tea?
I'm gonna make some tea.

537
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:26,955
Alan, please, last time I played
this game it ruined my life.

538
00:53:28,332 --> 00:53:31,168
- It ruined your life?
- Yes.

539
00:53:31,335 --> 00:53:36,131
"In the jungle you must wait
till the dice read five or eight."

540
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:39,301
I was a little girl, Alan.

541
00:53:39,635 --> 00:53:41,512
You disappeared.

542
00:53:42,638 --> 00:53:47,476
And a bunch of bats surrounded me
and chased me down the street.

543
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:49,478
I was afraid.

544
00:53:50,771 --> 00:53:52,648
I'm sorry, Alan.

545
00:53:53,482 --> 00:53:55,484
No one believed me. I was all alone.

546
00:53:55,651 --> 00:54:00,489
So was I, for 26 years, Sarah.

547
00:54:02,116 --> 00:54:03,826
Me too.

548
00:54:04,993 --> 00:54:08,914
It's okay, Sarah. We're scared too.

549
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:12,376
But if we finish the game,
it'll all go away.

550
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,129
What if I get stuck in the game?

551
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,922
You won't.

552
00:54:18,424 --> 00:54:20,717
Because I won't stop playing.

553
00:54:20,884 --> 00:54:22,344
And neither will I.

554
00:54:22,511 --> 00:54:24,638
I won't either.

555
00:54:32,396 --> 00:54:33,981
Come on, Sarah.

556
00:54:34,148 --> 00:54:35,357
Please?

557
00:54:44,450 --> 00:54:46,034
I knew this was gonna be a bad day.

558
00:54:47,536 --> 00:54:50,122
Hey, come on, we're gonna be fine.

559
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:52,374
We just have to keep our heads.

560
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:56,086
And roll with the punches.

561
00:55:14,563 --> 00:55:19,067
"A hunter from the darkest wild...

562
00:55:19,735 --> 00:55:23,280
...makes you feel just like a child."

563
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:25,073
What is it?

564
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,701
Van Pelt.

565
00:55:33,916 --> 00:55:38,086
You miserable coward!
Come back and face me like a man.

566
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:48,597
Not good enough, Sonny Jim.

567
00:55:49,598 --> 00:55:52,017
Coming, ready or not.

568
00:56:10,118 --> 00:56:11,787
Hey, you!

569
00:56:16,041 --> 00:56:18,669
Drop your gun
and get your hands in the air!

570
00:56:44,486 --> 00:56:47,322
Man, I don't believe this.

571
00:56:55,247 --> 00:56:57,332
So even if Alan gets out
of this situation...

572
00:56:57,499 --> 00:56:59,918
...same kind of thing will happen
over and over again.

573
00:57:00,335 --> 00:57:04,840
When you carry around repressed anger,
it attracts a lot of negative energy...

574
00:57:05,007 --> 00:57:08,927
...and things happen, like ending up
in the jungle. That was no accident.

575
00:57:09,094 --> 00:57:10,345
There are no accidents.

576
00:57:10,512 --> 00:57:11,597
Whose turn is it?

577
00:57:12,723 --> 00:57:15,267
- It's my turn.
- Really? Great.

578
00:57:15,434 --> 00:57:18,186
You might've told us
there was a man that hunts people.

579
00:57:18,353 --> 00:57:21,189
Well, I didn't know, okay?
It's just the roll of the dice.

580
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:24,276
Is he the reason you didn't wanna play?

581
00:57:26,236 --> 00:57:28,155
You didn't wanna play either?

582
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:32,367
Mr. We-Started-Something-26-Years-
Ago-and-Now-We-Gotta-Finish-It?

583
00:57:35,203 --> 00:57:36,413
What's with this guy?

584
00:57:36,580 --> 00:57:41,084
He's a hunter. He kills things. That's what
he does. Right now, he wants to kill me.

585
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:42,586
- Why you?
- Why me?

586
00:57:42,753 --> 00:57:46,715
I don't know. You'd think
it'd be a waste of his time.

587
00:57:46,882 --> 00:57:48,759
Maybe he needs something for his wall.

588
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:50,385
- A Parrish.
- It's your turn.

589
00:57:50,552 --> 00:57:53,555
Have you ever talked with him
about your differences?

590
00:57:53,722 --> 00:57:59,019
- Are you crazy? The man has a gun...
- Don't ever call me crazy, Alan! Ever.

591
00:57:59,186 --> 00:58:03,148
Everyone's called me crazy ever since
I said you were sucked into a game.

592
00:58:03,899 --> 00:58:06,568
- Maybe I should roll.
- Yeah.

593
00:58:06,735 --> 00:58:08,654
I was the girl who saw you murdered.

594
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,239
Do you think anybody showed up
at my birthday party?

595
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:14,660
- Hello, I'm rolling now. I'm gonna roll.
- Billy who?

596
00:58:15,118 --> 00:58:18,914
What are you, an owl? Come on, Madam
Serena, dig into your consciousness.

597
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:20,749
- Here, just roll.
- Find the memory...

598
00:58:20,916 --> 00:58:22,626
...of your old boyfriend Billy.

599
00:58:22,793 --> 00:58:26,797
- The little kid who'd steal your bicycle?
- The big kid who took you to the movies.

600
00:58:26,963 --> 00:58:31,301
"Don't be fooled, it isn't thunder.
Staying put would be a blunder."

601
00:58:31,468 --> 00:58:33,136
- No, you're immature. No...
- You are.

602
00:58:33,303 --> 00:58:36,848
- I know you are, but what am I?
- You are. I don't have to fall for this.

603
00:58:37,015 --> 00:58:38,600
Do you feel that?

604
00:59:03,792 --> 00:59:05,127
Run.

605
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:07,754
It's a stampede!

606
00:59:07,921 --> 00:59:10,549
- Come on.
- The game!

607
00:59:16,847 --> 00:59:17,973
Don't look back!

608
00:59:45,333 --> 00:59:47,252
Not the game!

609
00:59:55,802 --> 00:59:58,054
Why didn't you grab the game, Peter?

610
00:59:58,221 --> 00:59:59,890
Just ignore him, honey. He's a Libra.

611
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:02,684
- Where are you going?
- He'll head for water!

612
01:00:02,851 --> 01:00:04,436
Here we go. Come on.

613
01:00:05,771 --> 01:00:08,023
- Hello?
- It's Aunt Nora. Where have you been?

614
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:11,234
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
You have the wrong number.

615
01:00:14,237 --> 01:00:15,280
Wait for me!

616
01:00:33,757 --> 01:00:36,885
- What can I do for you?
- I'll have a gross of these.

617
01:00:37,302 --> 01:00:40,430
You know, they stopped
making these in 1903.

618
01:00:40,597 --> 01:00:44,226
Damn. Then I shall need
a replacement weapon.

619
01:00:44,392 --> 01:00:45,811
Well, there's a waiting period.

620
01:00:46,394 --> 01:00:50,065
And you'll have to fill out these.

621
01:00:52,150 --> 01:00:54,194
Or I could fill these out.

622
01:00:54,361 --> 01:00:55,946
Louise.

623
01:01:00,659 --> 01:01:04,412
Now, anyone asks,
you didn't get this here.

624
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,503
You're not a postal worker, are you?

625
01:01:14,965 --> 01:01:16,925
Alan!

626
01:01:19,427 --> 01:01:20,428
Quiet.

627
01:01:31,815 --> 01:01:33,441
Okay.

628
01:01:37,863 --> 01:01:39,281
Here, boy.

629
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:44,327
No!

630
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,459
- Peter!
- Peter!

631
01:02:56,024 --> 01:02:58,610
- Peter, are you okay?
- That was great!

632
01:02:58,777 --> 01:03:01,237
I can't believe you did that.
That was so cool.

633
01:03:01,404 --> 01:03:04,866
- You gave me chills. Oh, my God.
- It was great.

634
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:07,369
Alan.

635
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:10,872
It's nice work.
Come on, give me the game. Let's go.

636
01:03:29,099 --> 01:03:30,809
Oh, no.

637
01:03:31,559 --> 01:03:33,728
Act natural.

638
01:03:37,357 --> 01:03:38,733
Hey!

639
01:03:39,275 --> 01:03:40,944
Hide the game.

640
01:03:45,740 --> 01:03:48,910
I don't believe this.
Every time there's trouble, I run into you.

641
01:03:49,536 --> 01:03:51,663
Me? I don't know
what you're talking about.

642
01:03:51,830 --> 01:03:54,749
- All right. I'm taking you in.
- I'm not going anywhere.

643
01:03:55,834 --> 01:03:56,918
Just...

644
01:03:57,377 --> 01:03:58,795
All right.

645
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:02,757
Just a second. You can't take him, he's...

646
01:04:02,924 --> 01:04:05,510
- Her fiancé.
- Wait. You said, he's your uncle.

647
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:09,764
It's all right. I'll be back soon.

648
01:04:14,227 --> 01:04:15,437
Blast.

649
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:18,273
Remember, you said
you'd never abandon your friends.

650
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,151
- We'll finish the game later. Okay?
- Later?

651
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:23,653
Van Pelt. Van Pelt.

652
01:04:24,112 --> 01:04:26,865
I suggest you all go home now.

653
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:28,450
Okay.

654
01:04:33,288 --> 01:04:36,124
Now how are we supposed
to finish the game?

655
01:04:36,291 --> 01:04:39,044
We can't.
We can't finish it without him.

656
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,295
Judy!

657
01:04:41,171 --> 01:04:42,630
What?

658
01:04:45,133 --> 01:04:46,176
What happened?

659
01:04:46,342 --> 01:04:49,471
I thought I could end the game myself.
I was only 10 spaces away.

660
01:04:49,929 --> 01:04:52,307
"A law of Jumanji having been broken...

661
01:04:52,474 --> 01:04:54,684
...you will slip back
even more than your token."

662
01:04:56,144 --> 01:04:57,520
You tried to cheat?

663
01:04:57,687 --> 01:05:00,815
No, I tried to drop the dice
so they'd land on 12.

664
01:05:00,982 --> 01:05:03,193
Oh, okay, honey.
Well, that would be cheating.

665
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:07,655
Peter, your hands! Look at your hands!

666
01:05:34,224 --> 01:05:38,436
Come in, this is Willy.
They cleaned out Larry's Hardware.

667
01:05:38,603 --> 01:05:42,315
I can't stop them.
Get the National Guard down here now.

668
01:05:42,482 --> 01:05:45,110
All right. What is this about?
I know you know.

669
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:49,030
Yes, I do. But you wouldn't
believe me even if I told you, Carl.

670
01:05:49,197 --> 01:05:52,575
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
How do you know my name is Carl?

671
01:05:52,742 --> 01:05:54,536
I know a lot more than that.

672
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:57,622
I know you used to work
on the stamping line at Parrish Shoes.

673
01:05:57,789 --> 01:06:00,083
They used to call you Sole Man.

674
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:02,418
Sole Man, yeah, that's right.

675
01:06:02,585 --> 01:06:05,672
I was in there too, man,
till old man Parrish fired me.

676
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:08,007
- He fired you?
- Yeah, man.

677
01:06:08,174 --> 01:06:11,594
And I had something, I could've turned
this whole town around.

678
01:06:11,761 --> 01:06:14,055
- Your shoes.
- Right.

679
01:06:14,556 --> 01:06:16,391
Listen, Carl?

680
01:06:17,392 --> 01:06:20,228
I know it doesn't mean much
after 26 years...

681
01:06:20,395 --> 01:06:22,230
...but I'm sorry.

682
01:06:22,397 --> 01:06:23,731
I'm sorry.

683
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:26,818
Sorry for what?

684
01:06:27,402 --> 01:06:28,570
It's me, Alan.

685
01:06:32,782 --> 01:06:35,243
Thank you. Come on.

686
01:06:35,410 --> 01:06:36,452
What's going on?

687
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:39,998
Well, apparently, there's a sale, honey.

688
01:06:45,253 --> 01:06:47,839
You just saw three monkeys
on a motorcycle, didn't you?

689
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:49,591
- Yes.
- Good girl. Come on.

690
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:54,262
Well, maybe we can bail him out
with a check.

691
01:06:54,429 --> 01:06:56,014
Thank you.

692
01:06:56,181 --> 01:06:58,933
You tell that sniveling coward from me,
if he wants...

693
01:07:04,814 --> 01:07:06,399
Boy!

694
01:07:06,941 --> 01:07:09,277
Get out of my way!

695
01:07:12,155 --> 01:07:14,657
Hey, kid! What are you doing?

696
01:08:00,328 --> 01:08:02,664
- Give me that, boy!
- No!

697
01:08:03,498 --> 01:08:05,083
Hey!

698
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:07,168
- Peter!
- Help me!

699
01:08:07,877 --> 01:08:09,837
Get me out of here!

700
01:08:10,004 --> 01:08:12,674
- It's all right.
- Oh, my God, Peter. Come on.

701
01:08:25,019 --> 01:08:26,521
All right.

702
01:08:41,452 --> 01:08:44,372
- There it is.
- Wait here.

703
01:08:53,298 --> 01:08:54,882
Gotcha, girlie.

704
01:08:55,717 --> 01:08:56,759
No.

705
01:08:56,926 --> 01:08:59,470
When Alan hears of your predicament,
he'll come.

706
01:08:59,637 --> 01:09:03,266
He doesn't even know I'm here.
It won't work. Your plan's ruined.

707
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:08,730
- Don't move or I'll blow your brains out!
- Okay.

708
01:09:08,896 --> 01:09:10,648
- Okay.
- Call the cops!

709
01:09:10,815 --> 01:09:12,734
- That should do the trick.
- Oh, yeah.

710
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:20,241
Price check!

711
01:09:23,995 --> 01:09:26,956
If you let me go, I can stop all this.

712
01:09:28,082 --> 01:09:30,293
It sounds like The Twilight Zone,
but it's true.

713
01:09:30,752 --> 01:09:33,212
Please, you gotta help me on this.

714
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:36,049
I know I'm gonna regret this.

715
01:09:36,215 --> 01:09:39,177
All right. Just hold still.

716
01:09:40,595 --> 01:09:43,097
- Okay.
- There, I let you go.

717
01:09:43,264 --> 01:09:45,600
Now what are we gonna do? Hey.

718
01:09:45,767 --> 01:09:47,435
- You are gonna stay here.
- My keys!

719
01:09:47,602 --> 01:09:49,103
It's for your own good. Stay there.

720
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:52,565
- My handcuff keys. Wait!
- This is something I have to do!

721
01:09:52,732 --> 01:09:54,734
- Alan!
- You'll thank me someday.

722
01:09:54,901 --> 01:09:56,110
Come in, Carl, code red.

723
01:09:56,277 --> 01:09:59,530
Hostage situation at Sir Sav-a-lot.
A woman and two children.

724
01:09:59,697 --> 01:10:03,117
Sounds like the armed perpetrator
in the pith helmet you reported.

725
01:10:03,284 --> 01:10:05,453
Carl? Come in, Carl.

726
01:10:05,620 --> 01:10:07,538
- Lorraine? Come in.
- What's Sir Sav-a-lot?

727
01:10:07,705 --> 01:10:09,457
- It's a discount store.
- Move over.

728
01:10:09,624 --> 01:10:13,252
- Wait, wait, wait. Gently, gently.
- Okay. All right, all right.

729
01:10:13,419 --> 01:10:15,129
Don't worry, I've done this before.

730
01:10:15,296 --> 01:10:16,964
Once.

731
01:10:41,364 --> 01:10:42,782
Where's Sir Sav-a-lot?

732
01:10:42,949 --> 01:10:44,784
- Monroe and Elm.
- The Episcopal church.

733
01:10:44,951 --> 01:10:47,203
It's not the church anymore.
It's a Speedy Burger.

734
01:10:47,370 --> 01:10:51,165
Or at least it was. I don't know
what's left of it. People are going loopy.

735
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:53,209
Judy!

736
01:11:04,679 --> 01:11:05,680
We got company.

737
01:11:05,847 --> 01:11:08,599
No. It's all right. That's a traffic cop.
He'll back us up.

738
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:04,405
- Here's the game.
- Come on. Get out of here.

739
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:10,870
Rats.

740
01:12:30,765 --> 01:12:34,602
- Turn the siren off. Right there! Okay.
- Okay, I got it.

741
01:12:41,484 --> 01:12:44,445
Stop your cringing, woman.
I could have shot you at any moment.

742
01:12:44,612 --> 01:12:45,821
Then why didn't you?

743
01:12:45,988 --> 01:12:48,616
You didn't roll the dice, Alan did.

744
01:12:48,783 --> 01:12:50,952
There it is, there it is. Hit the brakes.

745
01:12:51,118 --> 01:12:54,330
- Hit the brakes!
- I'm hitting them. I'm hitting the brakes!

746
01:12:54,497 --> 01:12:57,708
- Hit the brakes!
- The brakes! I am hitting the brakes!

747
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,293
He should be here any moment.

748
01:13:20,147 --> 01:13:21,774
Sarah!

749
01:13:22,984 --> 01:13:24,318
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

750
01:13:24,819 --> 01:13:27,697
- Where's Peter?
- I'm here.

751
01:13:29,699 --> 01:13:31,576
Oh, great.

752
01:13:34,328 --> 01:13:39,542
So remember, circumstances are
never, ever out of your control.

753
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:42,503
End of tape three.

754
01:13:43,671 --> 01:13:47,049
Update on the extraordinary events
unfolding in Brantford, New Hampshire.

755
01:13:47,216 --> 01:13:50,052
Ninety-eight people have been
hospitalized with symptoms...

756
01:13:50,219 --> 01:13:53,931
...ranging from inexplicable fevers
and rashes to violent seizures.

757
01:13:54,098 --> 01:13:56,726
Local resources have been strained
to the breaking point.

758
01:13:56,892 --> 01:14:02,857
And state health officials are now asking
those with such symptoms to dial 911.

759
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:49,820
I got it.

760
01:14:51,781 --> 01:14:54,408
Alan, talk to him. Please?

761
01:14:54,575 --> 01:14:56,827
What? We don't have time for this, okay?

762
01:14:56,994 --> 01:15:00,081
I know, but he's a kid
and he was trying to help.

763
01:15:00,873 --> 01:15:02,750
- All right, come on.
- Thank you.

764
01:15:02,917 --> 01:15:05,086
Judy, come on.

765
01:15:07,213 --> 01:15:09,590
I warned you about this, Peter.

766
01:15:10,424 --> 01:15:12,760
No, you wanted to play the game.

767
01:15:14,428 --> 01:15:18,015
What, are you crying? You don't cry,
all right? You keep your chin up.

768
01:15:18,182 --> 01:15:20,267
Come on, keep your chin up.

769
01:15:21,227 --> 01:15:23,688
Crying never helped
anybody do anything, okay?

770
01:15:24,980 --> 01:15:28,192
You have a problem,
you face it like a man.

771
01:15:34,865 --> 01:15:36,784
Hey. Hey.

772
01:15:38,035 --> 01:15:41,997
I'm sorry. Twenty-six years buried
in the deepest, darkest jungle...

773
01:15:42,164 --> 01:15:43,999
...and I still became my father.

774
01:15:44,166 --> 01:15:48,170
It's okay. Come here, I'm sorry.
Hey, it's all right.

775
01:15:48,796 --> 01:15:51,173
Remember what you said?
It's all right to be afraid.

776
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:53,467
It's not that.

777
01:15:53,968 --> 01:15:55,553
What is it?

778
01:16:07,898 --> 01:16:09,400
Okay.

779
01:16:09,900 --> 01:16:11,318
Ready?

780
01:16:13,904 --> 01:16:18,784
Don't worry, we're gonna have you turned
back into your old self in no time flat.

781
01:16:18,951 --> 01:16:21,370
Because we're gonna go in here
and together...

782
01:16:21,537 --> 01:16:24,206
...we're gonna sit down,
we're gonna finish that game.

783
01:16:24,373 --> 01:16:25,791
No matter...

784
01:16:25,958 --> 01:16:27,334
...what.

785
01:16:39,138 --> 01:16:42,266
Suddenly, I feel right at home.

786
01:17:15,007 --> 01:17:16,592
Lorraine, this is Carl.

787
01:17:16,759 --> 01:17:18,302
I think I know who's behind this.

788
01:17:18,469 --> 01:17:21,388
I'm heading over to the Parrish place.
Give me some backup.

789
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,558
Lorraine?

790
01:17:29,355 --> 01:17:30,981
Wait. Wait!

791
01:17:31,398 --> 01:17:32,566
Now what?

792
01:17:32,733 --> 01:17:33,901
Stop!

793
01:17:34,318 --> 01:17:36,237
Wait! Stop!

794
01:17:39,490 --> 01:17:40,783
Is there a problem, ma'am?

795
01:17:41,116 --> 01:17:43,577
- Oh, can I have a ride home?
- Where do you live?

796
01:17:43,744 --> 01:17:46,455
Jefferson Street. The old Parrish place.

797
01:17:46,622 --> 01:17:49,250
Do you have children? A boy and a girl?

798
01:17:49,416 --> 01:17:51,085
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Get in.

799
01:17:51,252 --> 01:17:53,295
I'll explain it all on the way.

800
01:18:22,950 --> 01:18:25,286
Fine! Take it!

801
01:18:25,452 --> 01:18:27,454
We gotta get to that house.

802
01:18:33,127 --> 01:18:35,462
- Shouldn't we play someplace else?
- No.

803
01:18:35,629 --> 01:18:38,883
I grew up in this.
It's out there that scares me.

804
01:18:40,259 --> 01:18:44,346
- Okay, it's my turn.
- Sarah, if you roll a 12, you win.

805
01:18:47,099 --> 01:18:49,059
Okay, ready? Here I go.

806
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:55,274
It's okay.

807
01:18:55,441 --> 01:19:00,154
"Every month at the quarter moon,
there'll be a monsoon...

808
01:19:00,321 --> 01:19:01,906
...in your lagoon."

809
01:19:02,072 --> 01:19:03,824
Monsoon.

810
01:19:03,991 --> 01:19:05,367
Well, at least we're inside.

811
01:19:07,828 --> 01:19:09,663
Yeah, right.

812
01:19:31,477 --> 01:19:34,188
Well, a little rain never hurt anybody.

813
01:19:34,355 --> 01:19:35,940
Yeah, but a lot can kill you.

814
01:19:36,857 --> 01:19:38,525
Come on.

815
01:19:39,693 --> 01:19:41,195
This way!

816
01:19:46,450 --> 01:19:49,119
- What do we do now?
- We get to higher ground.

817
01:19:49,286 --> 01:19:52,373
- Okay.
- Come on! Stay together!

818
01:19:52,539 --> 01:19:53,874
Peter, go!

819
01:20:08,555 --> 01:20:09,723
You all right, Peter?

820
01:20:12,142 --> 01:20:13,477
- Judy!
- Alan?

821
01:20:13,644 --> 01:20:14,895
- What?
- What is that?

822
01:20:16,230 --> 01:20:19,733
Swim! Go! Go!

823
01:20:24,321 --> 01:20:27,157
- Alan!
- Judy! Swim! Go! Move!

824
01:20:30,077 --> 01:20:31,662
Keep going!

825
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,623
Stay on the table!

826
01:20:34,915 --> 01:20:37,376
Peter! Feet out of the water!

827
01:20:40,421 --> 01:20:42,464
On the chandelier!

828
01:20:44,174 --> 01:20:46,010
Stay with Peter!

829
01:20:51,265 --> 01:20:52,933
Come on, Sarah.

830
01:20:59,606 --> 01:21:01,150
Peter!

831
01:21:07,156 --> 01:21:08,949
Hang on, Sarah!

832
01:21:12,453 --> 01:21:13,787
Are you okay? Are you okay?

833
01:21:28,677 --> 01:21:30,054
Where...?

834
01:21:31,472 --> 01:21:33,640
- Alan!
- Alan!

835
01:21:40,147 --> 01:21:42,316
Judy? Peter!

836
01:21:42,483 --> 01:21:45,027
Ma'am, step back
and let me handle this, please.

837
01:21:45,194 --> 01:21:48,155
It's probably nothing.
They probably left the TV on too loud.

838
01:21:48,322 --> 01:21:51,075
Peter? Judy?

839
01:21:52,826 --> 01:21:56,038
I always wanted to do this.
Could you step back, please?

840
01:22:15,682 --> 01:22:18,519
- Alan, give me your hand!
- Alan!

841
01:22:21,647 --> 01:22:24,191
- Grab my hand!
- I got it.

842
01:22:26,110 --> 01:22:28,695
Alan!

843
01:22:45,671 --> 01:22:47,047
Take the game.

844
01:22:47,214 --> 01:22:49,466
Here. Here you go.

845
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:57,099
- You okay?
- Yeah.

846
01:23:02,521 --> 01:23:05,232
Alan, you wrestled an alligator for me.

847
01:23:08,777 --> 01:23:09,903
It was a crocodile.

848
01:23:10,779 --> 01:23:14,449
Alligators don't have
that little fringe on their hind leg.

849
01:23:14,908 --> 01:23:16,577
Come on.

850
01:23:19,705 --> 01:23:21,540
My mistake.

851
01:23:31,675 --> 01:23:33,177
It's okay.

852
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:43,270
Come on.

853
01:23:48,734 --> 01:23:51,028
Okay, it's my turn.

854
01:23:51,195 --> 01:23:53,113
I've got it.

855
01:23:53,447 --> 01:23:56,450
Colonel Mustard in the library
with the wrench.

856
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:00,370
Clue.

857
01:24:01,622 --> 01:24:03,040
Okay.

858
01:24:12,257 --> 01:24:15,344
"Beware the ground on which you stand.

859
01:24:15,510 --> 01:24:18,388
The floor is quicker than the sand."

860
01:24:20,641 --> 01:24:23,477
- Alan! Okay.
- Help me!

861
01:24:24,019 --> 01:24:26,146
- Help me.
- Okay. Okay. Stay calm.

862
01:24:26,313 --> 01:24:27,981
Don't struggle. Stay calm.

863
01:24:28,148 --> 01:24:29,316
- I'm calm.
- Alan!

864
01:24:30,567 --> 01:24:32,527
- Grab on!
- Okay. Pull!

865
01:24:32,945 --> 01:24:36,406
Okay. I got it. Pull!

866
01:24:39,910 --> 01:24:41,828
Stay calm!

867
01:24:42,496 --> 01:24:43,538
Come on!

868
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:47,000
Oh, good! All right.

869
01:24:49,711 --> 01:24:51,338
I got you...

870
01:24:52,005 --> 01:24:54,258
Stop giving me things that come apart!

871
01:24:56,677 --> 01:24:58,262
"There is a lesson..."

872
01:24:58,428 --> 01:24:59,888
All right.

873
01:25:02,808 --> 01:25:04,518
"There is lesson you will learn."

874
01:25:05,519 --> 01:25:06,561
Oh, I got you.

875
01:25:09,356 --> 01:25:12,192
"Sometimes you must go back a turn."

876
01:25:15,070 --> 01:25:16,947
- Oh, did I hurt you?
- Oh, no.

877
01:25:17,114 --> 01:25:18,740
Oh, dear.

878
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,037
Thank you, Judy. Thank you.
That was very quick thinking.

879
01:25:24,204 --> 01:25:26,873
Sarah and I would like
to get out of the floor.

880
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:28,875
So it's your turn, Peter.

881
01:25:29,293 --> 01:25:30,794
Okay.

882
01:25:37,718 --> 01:25:39,594
I thought I'd lost you again.

883
01:25:39,761 --> 01:25:41,972
Thanks for sticking around this time.

884
01:25:47,728 --> 01:25:50,230
"Need a hand? Why, you just wait.

885
01:25:50,647 --> 01:25:54,234
We'll help you out. We each have eight."

886
01:26:03,410 --> 01:26:04,911
What's that? What is it?

887
01:26:05,078 --> 01:26:07,122
- Nothing.
- You don't go... for nothing.

888
01:26:10,751 --> 01:26:14,171
Peter, my dad kept an ax
in the woodshed. Go get it!

889
01:26:14,338 --> 01:26:17,007
- Okay.
- Hurry! Go, go, go!

890
01:26:27,934 --> 01:26:29,603
Sarah!

891
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:01,468
Judy?

892
01:27:01,968 --> 01:27:03,637
Peter?

893
01:27:04,638 --> 01:27:05,847
No...

894
01:27:10,769 --> 01:27:12,354
There's a...

895
01:27:20,654 --> 01:27:23,156
- Peter!
- Judy! Behind you, get it!

896
01:27:26,410 --> 01:27:29,204
Aunt Nora, it's me. Peter.

897
01:27:34,835 --> 01:27:38,004
Sorry. I can't talk right now.
I'll explain later.

898
01:27:38,171 --> 01:27:39,673
- Sarah.
- What?

899
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:42,509
It's your turn.
You can finish if you roll a seven.

900
01:27:42,676 --> 01:27:45,429
- I can't roll.
- Put the dice in your mouth.

901
01:27:45,595 --> 01:27:48,515
Judy! Bring the game. Hurry!

902
01:27:53,061 --> 01:27:55,105
Judy!

903
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:04,239
Judy, are you okay?

904
01:28:04,406 --> 01:28:06,533
I'm fine. Help them.

905
01:28:10,704 --> 01:28:12,205
Come on, Judy. Come on.

906
01:28:12,372 --> 01:28:14,499
- Judy!
- Judy.

907
01:28:15,709 --> 01:28:17,043
Give me the dice.

908
01:28:26,219 --> 01:28:29,055
"You're almost there, with much at stake.

909
01:28:29,222 --> 01:28:31,391
But now the ground begins to quake."

910
01:28:31,558 --> 01:28:33,059
Judy!

911
01:28:35,061 --> 01:28:36,771
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

912
01:28:42,402 --> 01:28:45,071
I wish Mom and Dad were here.

913
01:28:45,864 --> 01:28:47,073
So do I.

914
01:28:58,460 --> 01:29:01,171
Her only chance is if we finish the game!

915
01:29:01,338 --> 01:29:03,131
It's your turn!

916
01:29:03,298 --> 01:29:04,758
Oh, my God!

917
01:29:18,021 --> 01:29:20,273
Get the game! The game!

918
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,192
No, I won't let you go!

919
01:29:31,034 --> 01:29:32,202
Alan!

920
01:29:50,512 --> 01:29:52,430
Don't move.

921
01:29:56,518 --> 01:29:58,144
Stand up.

922
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:04,985
What's in your hand?

923
01:30:07,529 --> 01:30:08,655
Drop it.

924
01:30:19,165 --> 01:30:20,917
End of the line, Sonny Jim.

925
01:30:21,084 --> 01:30:23,712
Game's up. Start running.

926
01:30:26,131 --> 01:30:27,173
No.

927
01:30:28,758 --> 01:30:30,385
Aren't you afraid?

928
01:30:31,219 --> 01:30:32,429
I'm terrified.

929
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,223
But my father told me...

930
01:30:36,474 --> 01:30:38,893
...you should always face
what you're afraid of.

931
01:30:43,732 --> 01:30:47,861
Good lad.
You're finally acting like a man.

932
01:30:49,362 --> 01:30:50,697
Any last words?

933
01:31:00,999 --> 01:31:03,043
Jumanji.

934
01:31:05,629 --> 01:31:07,047
It's Jumanji.

935
01:31:09,549 --> 01:31:11,259
No, Alan, no!

936
01:31:28,401 --> 01:31:29,819
What...?

937
01:32:40,390 --> 01:32:42,142
Forgot my speech notes.

938
01:32:46,146 --> 01:32:48,732
Dad, I'm so glad you're back.

939
01:32:49,649 --> 01:32:51,526
I've only been gone five minutes.

940
01:32:53,445 --> 01:32:56,156
It seems like a lot longer to me.

941
01:32:57,657 --> 01:33:00,702
Hey, I thought you told me
you were never gonna talk to me again.

942
01:33:04,497 --> 01:33:08,501
Whatever I said, Dad, I'm sorry.

943
01:33:11,504 --> 01:33:13,339
Look, Alan...

944
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,592
I was angry.

945
01:33:16,009 --> 01:33:18,845
I'm sorry too, son.

946
01:33:22,557 --> 01:33:27,562
Look, you don't have to go to Cliffside
if you don't want to.

947
01:33:30,565 --> 01:33:34,068
Let's talk it over tomorrow. Man to man.

948
01:33:36,738 --> 01:33:38,865
How about father to son?

949
01:33:39,866 --> 01:33:41,659
Great.

950
01:33:42,994 --> 01:33:46,539
Hey, I've gotta get going.
I'm the guest of honor.

951
01:33:48,500 --> 01:33:49,876
Dad?

952
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:58,218
Back in 196...
I mean, today in the factory...

953
01:33:58,885 --> 01:34:00,553
...it wasn't Carl Bentley's fault.

954
01:34:01,054 --> 01:34:03,765
I put the shoe on the conveyer belt.

955
01:34:06,184 --> 01:34:08,561
Glad you told me, son.

956
01:34:09,229 --> 01:34:10,897
Thanks.

957
01:34:11,898 --> 01:34:13,358
Bye, Dad.

958
01:34:14,192 --> 01:34:15,568
Goodbye.

959
01:34:25,453 --> 01:34:29,082
- Holy smokes! Judy and Peter!
- Alan.

960
01:34:29,874 --> 01:34:31,584
They're not there.

961
01:34:32,418 --> 01:34:35,088
It's 1969.

962
01:34:35,255 --> 01:34:37,841
They don't even exist yet.

963
01:35:07,662 --> 01:35:10,331
I'm starting to forget
what it's like to be a grown-up.

964
01:35:10,707 --> 01:35:14,294
That's okay,
as long as we don't forget each other.

965
01:35:14,711 --> 01:35:16,170
Or Judy and Peter.

966
01:35:17,755 --> 01:35:20,341
Alan, there's something
I've been wanting to do.

967
01:35:21,593 --> 01:35:25,054
And I better do it
before I feel too much like a kid.

968
01:35:44,407 --> 01:35:48,494
They probably don't teach driver training
in the sixth grade, huh?

969
01:36:03,426 --> 01:36:05,053
Merry Christmas.

970
01:36:06,012 --> 01:36:07,931
Do you want any of these?

971
01:36:14,687 --> 01:36:17,357
No, Dad. It's a new cross-trainer.
It's doing fabulous.

972
01:36:17,523 --> 01:36:20,693
- No, it's not a bra, it's a shoe.
- Honey, they're here.

973
01:36:20,860 --> 01:36:24,405
Listen, Dad, I gotta run. Merry Christmas.
We'll pick you up tomorrow, okay?

974
01:36:24,572 --> 01:36:27,867
You'll be the best Christmas gift of all.
Bye-bye! Bye-bye.

975
01:36:28,034 --> 01:36:31,371
- They're here? Let's go.
- Yeah, come on. Okay.

976
01:36:31,537 --> 01:36:32,914
- Hi.
- Lisa, hi.

977
01:36:33,289 --> 01:36:34,874
Pardon me.

978
01:36:35,041 --> 01:36:37,043
Jim! Glad you could make it.

979
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:40,088
- Thanks. This is my wife, Martha.
- Hi, Martha. This is Sarah.

980
01:36:40,254 --> 01:36:42,298
- Hi, Sarah.
- Where are the kids?

981
01:36:43,299 --> 01:36:45,134
Oh, my God, there they are.

982
01:36:46,386 --> 01:36:47,804
How'd you know?

983
01:36:48,888 --> 01:36:51,349
A guess. A guess, of course.
They're your kids.

984
01:36:51,516 --> 01:36:53,559
Well, you're right, these are our children.

985
01:36:54,102 --> 01:36:56,896
Judy and Peter.
Kids, say hi to Mr. and Mrs. Parrish.

986
01:36:57,063 --> 01:36:58,398
Nice to meet you.

987
01:36:58,564 --> 01:37:00,400
Nice to meet you.

988
01:37:02,026 --> 01:37:04,320
You're just like we remembered you.

989
01:37:06,739 --> 01:37:09,158
I feel like we know so much about them.

990
01:37:09,909 --> 01:37:11,077
Because, you know...

991
01:37:11,244 --> 01:37:14,414
- You've told Alan so much about them.
- Yeah, and I told her.

992
01:37:15,289 --> 01:37:17,834
- I'll go get the presents.
- Sure, honey.

993
01:37:18,001 --> 01:37:19,752
Well, we love children.

994
01:37:19,919 --> 01:37:22,588
- Merry Christmas.
- Cool.

995
01:37:25,675 --> 01:37:26,801
So when can you start?

996
01:37:26,968 --> 01:37:31,472
We were thinking of taking a skiing
holiday up in the Canadian Rockies.

997
01:37:31,639 --> 01:37:33,016
- No!
- No!

998
01:37:35,268 --> 01:37:36,352
Sorry.

999
01:37:36,811 --> 01:37:38,730
We... We just...

1000
01:37:38,896 --> 01:37:41,983
Need you to get that marketing done
on the new line, pronto.

1001
01:37:43,026 --> 01:37:45,778
It's no problem. You know,
I could probably start next week.

1002
01:37:45,945 --> 01:37:50,908
That'd be great. Let me introduce you to
the rest of the folks you'll be working with.

1003
01:37:51,075 --> 01:37:55,747
Come on in. Our house was your house.
Is. Anytime you'd like.

1004
01:38:06,507 --> 01:38:08,009
What's that noise?

1005
01:38:09,305 --> 01:39:09,274
