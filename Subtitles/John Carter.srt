1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:36,913
<i>Mars,</i>

3
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:40,792
<i>so you name it,
and think that you know it.</i>

4
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,044
<i>The Red Planet.</i>

5
00:00:43,127 --> 00:00:45,171
<i>No air, no life.</i>

6
00:00:45,338 --> 00:00:50,843
<i>But you do not know Mars,
for its true name is Barsoom.</i>

7
00:00:52,095 --> 00:00:54,597
<i>And it is not airless, nor is it dead,</i>

8
00:00:56,933 --> 00:00:58,977
<i>but it is dying.</i>

9
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:02,438
<i>The city of Zodanga saw to that.</i>

10
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:08,319
<i>Zodanga, the predator city,</i>

11
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:10,989
<i>moving, devouring,</i>

12
00:01:11,823 --> 00:01:14,325
<i>draining Barsoom of energy and life.</i>

13
00:01:17,287 --> 00:01:21,416
<i>Only the great city of Helium
dared resist, stood strong,</i>

14
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,876
<i>matched Zodanga airship for airship,</i>

15
00:01:24,002 --> 00:01:26,337
<i>holding fast for a thousand years.</i>

16
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:31,259
<i>Until one day the ruler of Zodanga</i>

17
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,845
<i>became cornered in a sandstorm.</i>

18
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,348
<i>And everything changed.</i>

19
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:41,436
I need clean lights!

20
00:01:41,519 --> 00:01:42,520
Full loft, aye!

21
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:45,773
Full loft!

22
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:00,705
Intensity full!

23
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:03,333
- Hard turn! Come about!
- Facing new plot!

24
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,835
No time! Hard turn now!

25
00:02:15,219 --> 00:02:16,721
There!

26
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,685
- Shadow!
- Shadow!

27
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,281
Death to Helium!

28
00:03:28,292 --> 00:03:30,878
Being a fool is a great luxury, Sab Than.

29
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:34,257
Get up.

30
00:03:36,592 --> 00:03:39,220
Who... What are you?

31
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,639
We serve the Goddess.

32
00:03:43,141 --> 00:03:46,310
And she has chosen you
to receive this weapon.

33
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:51,232
Do as we command
and you will rule all of Barsoom.

34
00:03:52,817 --> 00:03:54,902
With none to defy you.

35
00:03:56,112 --> 00:03:57,697
And nothing to stand in your way.

36
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:20,261
New York City, 1881

37
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:48,498
- Ma'am.

38
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,677
Ten words a minimum.

39
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:04,722
That's 50 cents,
unless you want special delivery.

40
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,519
Special delivery it is.

41
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,354
Name of sender?

42
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,231
Carter.

43
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:15,191
John Carter.

44
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,867
Croton-on-Hudson!

45
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,604
Mr. Burroughs? I'm Thompson,
Captain Carter's butler.

46
00:05:54,397 --> 00:05:58,109
Sir, I'm afraid I bring sad tidings.

47
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:17,461
Mr. Burroughs, Noah Dalton,
your uncle's attorney.

48
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:19,839
My deepest sympathies.

49
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:22,466
His death came as a shock to all of us.

50
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:26,137
He was a model of health and vigor.

51
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:27,889
He just dropped dead in his study

52
00:06:27,972 --> 00:06:31,684
not five minutes after sending
word for me and the doctor.

53
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,062
When I arrived he was already gone.

54
00:06:43,237 --> 00:06:45,573
The man never stopped digging.

55
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:47,491
All over the world.

56
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:52,413
No soon he started digging one hole
than he was off to Java

57
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:54,957
or the Orkney Islands to dig another.

58
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,418
He said it was pure research,

59
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:01,964
but it always seemed to me
like he was looking for something.

60
00:07:05,009 --> 00:07:07,136
Oh, and God grant me
he's found it now.

61
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:23,361
Every inch a cavalry man,
to the very end.

62
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:27,031
Mother always said that Jack
never really came back from the war.

63
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,201
That it was only his body
that went west.

64
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:37,124
He used to tell me
the most wondrous stories.

65
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:44,465
I'd like to pay my respects.

66
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,470
You won't find a keyhole.

67
00:07:49,553 --> 00:07:52,139
Thing only opens from the inside.

68
00:07:52,223 --> 00:07:53,891
He insisted.

69
00:07:54,016 --> 00:07:56,852
No embalming,
an open coffin, no funeral.

70
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,147
You don't acquire the kind of
wealth your uncle commanded

71
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:02,400
by being like the rest of us.

72
00:08:02,817 --> 00:08:04,902
Come. Let's go inside.

73
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:25,548
"And lastly, I hereby direct"

74
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:29,343
"that my estate
shall be held in trust for 25 years,"

75
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:32,096
"the income to benefit
my beloved nephew,"

76
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:34,098
"Edgar Rice Burroughs,"

77
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:37,601
"at the end of which term
the principal will revert to him."

78
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:41,063
"In full."

79
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:51,449
Of course I always adored
him, but it's been so long.

80
00:08:52,283 --> 00:08:53,951
Why me?

81
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:57,580
He never offered an explanation,
I never asked him for one.

82
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,711
It was his private journal.

83
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:06,714
He was most explicit that you,

84
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,717
and only you, would read its contents.

85
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,637
Now, you might possibly find
some kind of explanation in here.

86
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:18,309
I'll leave you now.

87
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:23,647
Again, my condolences.

88
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:55,930
<i>My dear Edgar,</i>

89
00:09:56,013 --> 00:09:57,932
<i>I remember how
I used to take you on my knee</i>

90
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,767
<i>and tell you wild tales,</i>

91
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:02,686
<i>which you always
did me the great courtesy of believing.</i>

92
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,855
<i>Now you are grown.</i>

93
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,607
<i>Time and space have parted us,</i>

94
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,776
<i>but I reach out across that distance</i>

95
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:10,402
<i>to that same wide-eyed boy</i>

96
00:10:10,486 --> 00:10:12,571
<i>and ask him to believe me once more.</i>

97
00:10:13,364 --> 00:10:16,492
<i>This wild tale begins 13 years ago</i>

98
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,285
<i>in the Arizona Territory</i>

99
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:21,038
<i>between the Pinaleño Mountains</i>

100
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:22,706
<i>and the backside of hell.</i>

101
00:10:23,124 --> 00:10:27,753
Fort Grant Outpost, 1868

102
00:10:43,811 --> 00:10:45,479
Ah.

103
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,857
Coming to load up on spider bait.

104
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:53,237
No more, Carter.

105
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:56,740
Is there a problem, Mr. Dix?

106
00:10:57,283 --> 00:10:59,368
- Yes, you're a goddamn loon!

107
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,412
I done took all your money, Carter.

108
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,372
Your tab's $100 in arrears.

109
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,748
I'll pray.

110
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:08,502
This old Yavapai I met
said he'd seen a cave...

111
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:12,673
No. Stop! Not one more word
about your cave of gold.

112
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:14,091
Oh, now, now.

113
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:16,218
Show some respect!

114
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:20,973
It's the evil spider cave of gold.

115
00:11:22,683 --> 00:11:24,768
You're cutoff, Carter.

116
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,979
Now get on home.

117
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:32,193
Now, I do believe

118
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,445
he done told you to get on out of here.

119
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:37,948
I'll leave when these bags are full.

120
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,793
I found that two days ago up by Bonita.

121
00:11:52,296 --> 00:11:54,423
That ought to cover my tab
and then some.

122
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:00,638
Beans.

123
00:12:00,721 --> 00:12:04,099
The first item is beans.

124
00:12:05,309 --> 00:12:06,852
John Carter?

125
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,480
Your presence
is requested up at the fort.

126
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:12,024
I suggest you come peaceably.

127
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:19,615
Do you, now?

128
00:12:26,497 --> 00:12:31,502
You are a difficult man to find,
Captain John Carter.

129
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,672
First Virginia Cavalry,

130
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:37,091
Army of Northern Virginia,

131
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:39,051
Confederate States of America.

132
00:12:40,344 --> 00:12:42,137
I'm Colonel Powell.

133
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,849
Welcome to the 7th Cavalry
of the United States...

134
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,398
Excellent horseman.

135
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:55,901
Fine swordsman.

136
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,197
Decorated six times,
including the Southern Cross of Honor.

137
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:06,370
At Five Forks, the company under
your command nearly turned the tide.

138
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:13,210
In short, a born fighter.

139
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,047
And in the eyes of Uncle Sam,

140
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,509
a necessary man for the defense
of the Arizona Territory.

141
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,969
No.

142
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:24,722
Son, we are up to
our chinstraps in Apaches.

143
00:13:24,805 --> 00:13:26,015
Ain't my concern.

144
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,642
I believe it is your concern, Captain.

145
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,478
Folks are being attacked
in their own homes. Slain.

146
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:34,189
You started it. You finish it.

147
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,152
You've gone native, have you?

148
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,362
Apaches can go to hell, too.

149
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:44,116
We're nothing but a warring species,
and I want no part of it.

150
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,200
You're a cavalry man.

151
00:13:45,284 --> 00:13:48,370
That makes you valuable
to our country and our cause.

152
00:13:48,454 --> 00:13:51,874
Colonel Powell, sir,

153
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,960
whatever it is you suppose I owe you,

154
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:58,839
our country or any other beloved cause,

155
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:01,091
I have already paid.

156
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:06,388
I have paid in full, sir.

157
00:14:12,895 --> 00:14:14,938
So let me tell you what I will do.

158
00:14:15,773 --> 00:14:17,566
I will break me out of this cell.

159
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:20,486
I will claim my gold and get filthy rich.

160
00:14:21,612 --> 00:14:26,700
Rich enough to buy your flat,
righteous blue behind

161
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:31,914
just so I can kick it all day long.

162
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:42,341
Captain, I'm finding it difficult to
reconcile the man on this piece of paper

163
00:14:42,758 --> 00:14:44,176
with the one I'm looking at.

164
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,429
I suggest you find
the horse sense to accept my offer

165
00:14:47,513 --> 00:14:49,973
before I give in to my better judgment.

166
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:56,939
Private, the man stays in the bull pit
till further notice.

167
00:14:57,481 --> 00:14:58,482
Yes, sir!

168
00:15:01,819 --> 00:15:03,404
John?

169
00:15:03,487 --> 00:15:05,614
- John?

170
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,158
Sleepy-head.

171
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,701
Supper's waiting for you.

172
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:25,926
Hey, hey, hey!

173
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,928
Hey! I gave you a bucket.

174
00:15:28,011 --> 00:15:29,596
I ain't going to tell you again.

175
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,140
Use the...

176
00:15:36,145 --> 00:15:37,604
- Colonel Powell!
- Argh!

177
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,022
Colonel Powell!

178
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:41,483
Colonel Powell!

179
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,611
Colonel Powell!

180
00:15:44,695 --> 00:15:47,406
Sir, he stole your horse.

181
00:15:51,034 --> 00:15:53,537
No. Son of a...

182
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,581
Carter!

183
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:24,234
That's Domingo's band!

184
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:25,986
Shut your damn mouth, Corporal.

185
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,000
What's he saying, Carter?

186
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:46,548
The hell's he saying now?

187
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:49,343
What the hell's he saying, Carter?

188
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,511
- He's saying...

189
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,061
Carter!

190
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:01,104
Agh!

191
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:18,455
I thought you didn't care!

192
00:17:18,914 --> 00:17:20,123
I don't!

193
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,066
Get up! Come on.

194
00:17:56,076 --> 00:17:57,828
Give me a gun. Give me a gun!

195
00:18:14,136 --> 00:18:15,429
I've got to look.

196
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:16,513
Cover me.

197
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,702
The spider.

198
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,423
This place sure ain't Apache.

199
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:55,677
It sure ain't.

200
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:12,569
Gold.

201
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:20,410
Carter!

202
00:19:20,494 --> 00:19:22,162
Right behind you!

203
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:31,505
Carter!

204
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:46,978
Ock ohem ocktei

205
00:19:48,438 --> 00:19:49,606
wies

206
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:57,823
Barsoom.

207
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,285
- What?
- Barsoom.

208
00:20:03,328 --> 00:20:04,329
Barsoom?

209
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,597
Oh, gee!

210
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,477
What the...

211
00:21:34,878 --> 00:21:36,379
No, no, no!

212
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,474
Wha...

213
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:11,474
Where the hell am I?

214
00:23:57,187 --> 00:23:58,313
What the...

215
00:23:59,522 --> 00:24:00,649
...hell are you?

216
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,447
Don't shoot him!

217
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,782
Don't shoot!

218
00:24:12,661 --> 00:24:14,037
Don't shoot him!

219
00:24:14,788 --> 00:24:16,748
We should kill it, Jeddak.

220
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:17,874
Move away.

221
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,225
Hello.

222
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:38,520
Don't run.

223
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,730
Don't run away.

224
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:43,400
Hello.

225
00:24:44,275 --> 00:24:45,652
Don't run.

226
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,114
Alright.

227
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:53,076
Alright.

228
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:03,378
All right.

229
00:25:04,045 --> 00:25:05,755
You've got me.

230
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:08,383
I surrender.

231
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,052
Jeddak.

232
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:14,597
- Jeddak?
- Jeddak.

233
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,934
Tars Tarkas.

234
00:25:19,436 --> 00:25:22,772
Tars Tarkas?

235
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,784
Captain John Carter, Virginia.

236
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,040
Vorginia.

237
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:43,460
Vorginia!

238
00:25:45,462 --> 00:25:47,213
No.

239
00:25:47,297 --> 00:25:50,633
My name is John Carter.

240
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,219
I'm from Virginia.

241
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:55,680
Virginia.

242
00:25:56,806 --> 00:25:57,807
Jump.

243
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:00,143
Jump like you jumped before.

244
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:01,770
Sack...

245
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:04,355
Jump, yeah?

246
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:06,149
Jump.

247
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:08,985
Sack.

248
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,695
Jump.

249
00:26:10,779 --> 00:26:12,155
Sack.

250
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:13,698
Jump!

251
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:18,161
Yes, sir.

252
00:26:22,832 --> 00:26:25,502
Virginia. Virginia.

253
00:26:26,669 --> 00:26:27,670
Don't!

254
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:30,924
Don't shoot him!

255
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,009
Don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!

256
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,768
What is this place? Where am I?

257
00:26:42,936 --> 00:26:44,270
It's alright, Virginia. Be still.

258
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,022
Where's my damn gold?

259
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,858
Eighteen have yet to hatch, Jeddak.

260
00:26:48,942 --> 00:26:53,196
Then they are weak and not Thark.

261
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:56,199
Leave nothing for the white apes.

262
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,916
Where on Earth am I?

263
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:10,338
Barsoom, a world on the brink.

264
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:15,051
For Zodanga's new power
threatens to destroy our city of Helium.

265
00:27:15,885 --> 00:27:19,848
And if Helium falls, so does Barsoom.

266
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,061
Rubbish.

267
00:27:25,228 --> 00:27:27,147
Goddess, help me, I'm hopeless.

268
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,899
I always come on too strong.

269
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:32,819
Your Highness.

270
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,112
My Jeddak.

271
00:27:38,074 --> 00:27:40,201
My Jeddak.

272
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:46,541
After years of tireless research,
I present to you

273
00:27:49,419 --> 00:27:51,546
the answer.

274
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,094
I hope.

275
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,974
My Jeddak, after years of...

276
00:28:03,057 --> 00:28:05,018
I'm sorry, Princess.

277
00:28:05,101 --> 00:28:07,145
The presentation will have to wait.

278
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,440
- Father, what's happened?
- Dejah!

279
00:28:16,988 --> 00:28:20,658
I know the terms set by Sab Than.

280
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:23,912
What I want to know
is can we afford to reject them?

281
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:28,708
Admiral Kantos Kan.

282
00:28:29,584 --> 00:28:32,128
The eastern border is a wasteland.

283
00:28:32,462 --> 00:28:34,130
<i>Sab Than has burned
through our defenses,</i>

284
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:36,132
<i>and the border folk will be massacred.</i>

285
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,302
<i>Our best troops and fleetest ships</i>

286
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:41,304
<i>are proven less than useless</i>

287
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:45,016
and now comes word that
our last remaining squadron

288
00:28:45,308 --> 00:28:46,684
has been lost.

289
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,485
Helium is lost.

290
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,445
My people.

291
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:00,156
I have failed them all.

292
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:02,492
No, my Jeddak, you haven't!

293
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,580
Forgive me, my lady,
but you have not seen this weapon.

294
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:10,500
It radiates the most intense, baleful

295
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:14,003
blue light.

296
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:21,511
When I read our reports
on Sab Than's weapon, I knew.

297
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,847
Somehow that idiotic brute
had discovered it first.

298
00:29:25,223 --> 00:29:26,307
Discovered what?

299
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,476
The Ninth Ray.

300
00:29:29,686 --> 00:29:31,104
Unlimited power.

301
00:29:32,313 --> 00:29:34,691
Sab Than only uses it for slaughter.

302
00:29:35,858 --> 00:29:39,487
But think of what Helium might
accomplish with such power.

303
00:29:40,321 --> 00:29:42,824
Transform the deserts, restore the seas.

304
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:45,868
Is this what you saw, Kantos?

305
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:48,997
It's starting to look very close.

306
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:51,124
Give it time.

307
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:52,917
It Will work.

308
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,727
Everyone, leave us.

309
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:32,582
Dejah, ever since you were a little girl,

310
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,753
you've always met the expectations
placed on you.

311
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:44,927
It's Sab's terms.

312
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,513
What are they?

313
00:30:49,599 --> 00:30:52,060
He will spare Helium

314
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,606
if you accept his hand in marriage.

315
00:30:58,524 --> 00:30:59,859
No!

316
00:30:59,942 --> 00:31:00,985
He is a monster!

317
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,528
You must refuse him!

318
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:04,364
He's already on his way here.

319
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:08,368
But all of my work...

320
00:31:08,451 --> 00:31:09,952
I just need a little more time.

321
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,829
- Dejah!
- How can you...

322
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,289
You can't just bow down to Zodanga!

323
00:31:13,498 --> 00:31:16,000
A wedding will save the city.

324
00:31:16,084 --> 00:31:17,877
Perhaps, but it could lose you Barsoom.

325
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,045
Dejah!

326
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,381
With no one to stop Zodanga,
it will be the beginning of the end!

327
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:24,384
- We do not have the luxury...
- You are the Jeddak of Helium!

328
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:25,885
You must find another way!

329
00:31:25,968 --> 00:31:27,553
There is no other way!

330
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:47,156
If there were,
I would risk anything to seize it.

331
00:31:48,616 --> 00:31:51,494
This is the chance we have been given.

332
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:56,332
Perhaps it is the will of the Goddess.

333
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,086
No.

334
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:02,964
It is your will.

335
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,472
So, when I was little,
and we would look up at the stars

336
00:32:12,515 --> 00:32:16,185
and you would tell me of the heroes
whose glory was written in the sky,

337
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:19,772
how there was a star up there for me,

338
00:32:25,695 --> 00:32:28,531
is this what you imagined
would be written on it?

339
00:32:37,123 --> 00:32:38,458
My Jeddak.

340
00:32:38,541 --> 00:32:40,543
Sab Than's corsair approaches the city.

341
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:44,505
They signal for permission to land.

342
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:49,051
Granted.

343
00:32:53,306 --> 00:32:56,934
And let us prepare ourselves
for a wedding.

344
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:08,237
I have destroyed the device,
Matai Shang.

345
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,448
She was on the verge of discovery.

346
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,993
<i>All is in place.
They will consent to the wedding.</i>

347
00:33:14,076 --> 00:33:16,204
Keep close watch over her.

348
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:19,081
We don't want anything to interfere
with our next move.

349
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,490
Sarkoja!

350
00:34:35,074 --> 00:34:36,367
Let Sola have a hatchling.

351
00:34:51,549 --> 00:34:53,676
Sola can take the little white worm.

352
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:58,389
Be still.

353
00:34:58,514 --> 00:34:59,599
Let go!

354
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,684
Be still!

355
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,069
What happened to you?

356
00:35:13,529 --> 00:35:15,156
Be still.

357
00:35:23,748 --> 00:35:26,125
Now we kill it.

358
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,378
Step away, Tal Hajus.

359
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:32,798
You prize this more
highly than my judgment?

360
00:35:33,215 --> 00:35:34,884
Step...

361
00:35:35,426 --> 00:35:37,178
...away.

362
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,433
I claim the right of challenge!

363
00:35:42,558 --> 00:35:45,269
And who supports your challenge?

364
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:55,404
Who will pledge their metal to mine?

365
00:36:07,083 --> 00:36:10,753
You are blind as a white ape, Tal Hajus.

366
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:13,381
You will not rule today.

367
00:36:15,424 --> 00:36:16,717
Not today.

368
00:36:17,426 --> 00:36:22,598
See the prize your Jeddak has found!

369
00:36:23,182 --> 00:36:25,309
Is it... a baby white ape?

370
00:36:25,393 --> 00:36:26,852
No!

371
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,063
It is a rare and valuable animal!

372
00:36:29,146 --> 00:36:31,732
It is called...

373
00:36:31,816 --> 00:36:33,275
It is called... Virginia!

374
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:38,114
Virginia!

375
00:36:42,743 --> 00:36:44,120
Watch. Everyone, step back.

376
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,207
Show them, Virginia.

377
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,417
Jump.

378
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:54,755
Jump!

379
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:12,273
By Issus, you will jump tomorrow, Virginia.

380
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,986
Sola, chain him.

381
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:20,573
Tell Sarkoja to initiate him
with the other hatchlings.

382
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,158
Wait, wait, wait!

383
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:57,193
I know. I know... Drink... Good...

384
00:38:06,577 --> 00:38:08,412
What's in that stuff?

385
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,791
The voice of Barsoom.

386
00:38:17,046 --> 00:38:19,215
You can hear it if you choose.

387
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,043
Easy.

388
00:38:58,379 --> 00:39:00,798
Nice monster dog.

389
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:32,830
How the hell did you...

390
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,020
Quit it!

391
00:40:22,963 --> 00:40:24,006
Stop it!

392
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:36,018
You killed him with one blow.

393
00:40:36,894 --> 00:40:38,062
I...

394
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,230
Wait.

395
00:40:40,481 --> 00:40:41,690
I understood you.

396
00:40:47,446 --> 00:40:49,531
What have you done?

397
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,118
Get off!

398
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:56,789
Get Off him!

399
00:40:57,539 --> 00:40:58,666
How did this happen?

400
00:41:00,417 --> 00:41:02,252
Who is to blame?

401
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,048
Woola.

402
00:41:27,736 --> 00:41:29,947
Do that again and I...

403
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:53,679
Enough!

404
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:05,983
There is no room
for another mark, Sola.

405
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:10,904
Your next offense will be your last.

406
00:42:25,044 --> 00:42:27,129
You will jump, Virginia.

407
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:28,797
Now.

408
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:30,799
Jeddak! Fliers!

409
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:32,801
You are the stones, the sand!

410
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,655
Sir, they continue to ignore our signals.

411
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:57,159
Enough! I've been patient.
I'll not be mocked.

412
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,327
Let them die!

413
00:43:01,455 --> 00:43:04,458
If that's how you plan
to treat your future bride,

414
00:43:04,541 --> 00:43:06,585
it's no wonder she ran from you.

415
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,630
Dejah Thoris must live.

416
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:10,756
In range, sir.

417
00:43:11,423 --> 00:43:12,674
You need only cripple the ship.

418
00:43:12,966 --> 00:43:15,594
A pulse to the radium drive
will be sufficient.

419
00:43:15,886 --> 00:43:18,680
Quick, clean, and precise.

420
00:43:19,098 --> 00:43:20,974
Jeddak, shall we destroy her?

421
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:22,810
No.

422
00:43:22,893 --> 00:43:24,436
We need only cripple her.

423
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,729
Now bring us around.

424
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:27,189
Zodanga.

425
00:43:27,272 --> 00:43:29,358
- Helium.
- Helium.

426
00:43:29,441 --> 00:43:30,692
Helium.

427
00:43:30,776 --> 00:43:32,152
Zodanga.

428
00:43:32,236 --> 00:43:34,530
They are the red flag, Helium the blue.

429
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:36,782
Zodanga's winning the war,

430
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:41,161
but I say let red men kill red men
until only Tharks remain.

431
00:43:52,339 --> 00:43:54,049
That don't look like a fair fight.

432
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:56,051
Zodanga never fights fair.

433
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,309
Where is she?

434
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,811
My Jeddak, that's all of them.

435
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,646
She can't have just
vanished into thin air.

436
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:09,273
- Check the dead.
- We have, sire.

437
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:11,066
Then check them again.

438
00:44:19,908 --> 00:44:21,076
To the bridge, now!

439
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:29,042
Look out!

440
00:44:42,848 --> 00:44:44,016
She's a human!

441
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,270
Sola!

442
00:44:56,111 --> 00:44:57,154
Who is that?

443
00:44:57,946 --> 00:44:59,823
I bet Virginia.

444
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:04,870
Beg your pardon, ma'am.

445
00:45:05,245 --> 00:45:07,289
If you'll kindly just stand behind me.

446
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:09,124
This might get dangerous.

447
00:45:28,894 --> 00:45:31,104
Or maybe I ought to get behind you.

448
00:45:35,901 --> 00:45:37,986
You let me know
when it gets dangerous.

449
00:46:24,366 --> 00:46:25,784
No.

450
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:27,911
Take him alive.

451
00:46:28,245 --> 00:46:31,373
What's the point of having this thing
if I don't get to use it?

452
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:35,961
Leave him!

453
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,275
What are you?

454
00:46:59,151 --> 00:47:01,820
You aren't red man nor quite white ape!

455
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:05,699
No matter.

456
00:47:05,782 --> 00:47:07,075
You can still bleed like...

457
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:09,828
Tharks!

458
00:47:10,037 --> 00:47:12,039
Fire!

459
00:47:20,922 --> 00:47:22,257
I surrender.

460
00:47:22,632 --> 00:47:24,718
You may take me captive.

461
00:47:33,977 --> 00:47:35,437
Prepare to turn about!

462
00:47:45,364 --> 00:47:47,157
Did I not tell you he could jump?

463
00:47:47,449 --> 00:47:49,159
Oh, my God.

464
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,038
Let go! Bad dog!

465
00:47:53,121 --> 00:47:56,291
You are ugly, but you are beautiful.

466
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,877
And you fight like a Thark.

467
00:48:02,255 --> 00:48:04,466
You lost your wager. You must pay.

468
00:48:05,967 --> 00:48:08,011
Jeddak of the Tharks.

469
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:12,641
I am Dejah Thoris,

470
00:48:12,933 --> 00:48:15,560
regent of the Royal Helium
Academy of Science.

471
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:18,397
- My research vessel...
- Your share of the spoils.

472
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,649
Sola! Tend to Virginia's property.

473
00:48:20,774 --> 00:48:21,858
Yes, my Jeddak!

474
00:48:22,025 --> 00:48:24,111
You know once Sab Than
has conquered us,

475
00:48:24,194 --> 00:48:25,987
he will turn his weapon upon you!

476
00:48:26,154 --> 00:48:29,741
I know that Zodanga
has found a way to defeat you

477
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:33,453
and now you seek
a mighty weapon of your own.

478
00:48:33,787 --> 00:48:36,873
But Virginia fights for us!

479
00:48:37,874 --> 00:48:41,169
- He'll fight the Torquas in the south...

480
00:48:41,753 --> 00:48:44,131
the Warhoon in the north

481
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:48,051
and he will be called Dotar Sojat,

482
00:48:48,135 --> 00:48:49,428
my right arms!

483
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,722
No.

484
00:48:56,393 --> 00:48:58,478
I don't fight for anyone.

485
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:09,030
Virginia, reject this honor

486
00:49:09,406 --> 00:49:13,243
and I cannot guarantee
the safety of your red girl.

487
00:49:24,337 --> 00:49:27,883
I am

488
00:49:30,177 --> 00:49:32,262
Dotar Sojat!

489
00:49:34,681 --> 00:49:36,725
To the plunder!

490
00:50:05,587 --> 00:50:07,714
War is a shameful thing.

491
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,472
Not when a noble cause is taken up
by those who can make a difference.

492
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:22,020
You made a difference today, Virginia.

493
00:50:24,356 --> 00:50:25,774
Okay.

494
00:50:25,857 --> 00:50:28,527
See, my name is John Carter.

495
00:50:29,277 --> 00:50:31,196
Virginia is where I'm from.

496
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,907
Where did you learn to jump that way?

497
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,951
I don't know.

498
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:37,661
How'd you learn to fly?

499
00:50:38,745 --> 00:50:42,457
Your ships cannot sail
on light in Virginia?

500
00:50:42,958 --> 00:50:44,459
No, Professor.

501
00:50:45,001 --> 00:50:46,670
See, our ships sail the seas.

502
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:52,342
Endless water everywhere.

503
00:50:59,266 --> 00:51:00,600
Skeletal structure normal.

504
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,227
What are you doing?

505
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:04,396
Must be the density of your bones.

506
00:51:05,188 --> 00:51:07,190
- Jump for me.
- Enough!

507
00:51:07,482 --> 00:51:09,693
There will be time for playfulness later.

508
00:51:09,776 --> 00:51:11,861
I want no playfulness from him.

509
00:51:11,945 --> 00:51:13,196
I want his help.

510
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:15,991
Explain to me how you do it.

511
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:20,078
If it's a skill, teach it to Helium.

512
00:51:20,954 --> 00:51:24,291
- Name your price.
- I'm not for hire.

513
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:29,212
I've got a cave of gold of my own.

514
00:51:29,629 --> 00:51:30,797
Somewhere.

515
00:51:32,090 --> 00:51:34,884
Only a madman would rave
about the time of oceans.

516
00:51:34,968 --> 00:51:37,012
Is that your expert view?

517
00:51:37,095 --> 00:51:39,431
- I'm mad?
- Or a liar.

518
00:51:39,681 --> 00:51:41,933
She is a good match for you,
Dotar Sojat.

519
00:51:42,017 --> 00:51:43,310
Don't call me that.

520
00:51:43,727 --> 00:51:45,562
There are no seas on the planet.

521
00:51:49,065 --> 00:51:50,525
You said "planet."

522
00:51:53,987 --> 00:51:55,947
Sun, then Rasoom.

523
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,198
Mercury.

524
00:51:57,282 --> 00:51:59,367
Then Cosoom.

525
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:02,287
Venus.

526
00:52:02,370 --> 00:52:03,830
Then Earth... us.

527
00:52:05,749 --> 00:52:07,834
That is Jasoom.

528
00:52:08,251 --> 00:52:11,212
You are on Barsoom, John Carter.

529
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:13,923
Mars.

530
00:52:14,841 --> 00:52:16,217
I'm on Mars?

531
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:31,024
Good God.

532
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:33,193
I'm on Mars.

533
00:52:35,945 --> 00:52:38,907
So, now home is Jasoom

534
00:52:39,282 --> 00:52:41,368
and you came on one
of your sailing ships

535
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:43,495
across millions
of karads of empty space?

536
00:52:43,620 --> 00:52:46,247
No. Not like that.

537
00:52:46,956 --> 00:52:49,668
Go on, shock me.

538
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:50,919
How?

539
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:55,799
That brought me here.

540
00:53:04,641 --> 00:53:05,809
Oh.

541
00:53:06,935 --> 00:53:09,145
Well, that explains everything, then.

542
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:13,066
- It does?
- Yes.

543
00:53:13,149 --> 00:53:14,359
You're a Thern

544
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,070
and you simply
wish to return to your rightful place.

545
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:18,154
Isn't that it?

546
00:53:18,363 --> 00:53:19,489
Yes.

547
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,491
Then let's sort this out right now.

548
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,785
Come along!

549
00:53:32,127 --> 00:53:33,712
Where are you going?

550
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:34,963
To your temple.

551
00:53:36,965 --> 00:53:39,050
No. No, you cannot enter here.

552
00:53:41,136 --> 00:53:42,804
It is forbidden!

553
00:53:43,471 --> 00:53:44,889
You are not Thark!

554
00:53:46,558 --> 00:53:47,726
Woola, stay!

555
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:08,913
Dotar Sojat.

556
00:54:08,997 --> 00:54:10,165
It is forbidden.

557
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,291
It is forbidden!

558
00:54:12,834 --> 00:54:15,503
Well, you speak for the Goddess.

559
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:18,631
What does she say?

560
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:23,595
You called me a Thern.

561
00:54:24,137 --> 00:54:25,513
Is that what she is?

562
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:28,433
No, she is Issus.

563
00:54:28,516 --> 00:54:30,894
Therns are holy messengers
of the Goddess.

564
00:54:30,977 --> 00:54:33,855
In the time of oceans,
they walked among us, guiding us.

565
00:54:34,606 --> 00:54:35,607
We must not offend.

566
00:54:36,149 --> 00:54:37,734
Let us go.

567
00:54:40,278 --> 00:54:42,238
There's some kind of writing up there.

568
00:54:58,004 --> 00:55:00,757
- Can you read it?
- It's old scripture.

569
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,801
There it is again.

570
00:55:02,884 --> 00:55:05,470
- What's it mean?
- Don't rush me.

571
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:08,056
"Those who seek the solace of eternity"

572
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,059
"may journey down the river"

573
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,977
"through the sacred Gates of Iss"

574
00:55:13,061 --> 00:55:15,522
"and find everlasting peace"

575
00:55:15,605 --> 00:55:17,065
"in the bosom of Issus."

576
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,444
The Gates of Iss.

577
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:28,409
What if I could take you there?

578
00:55:34,582 --> 00:55:36,709
What if I didn't trust you?

579
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:40,672
Then we'd be even.

580
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:46,177
I can take you to the Gates,
to the answers that you seek.

581
00:55:47,762 --> 00:55:49,013
A way back to Jasoom.

582
00:55:49,097 --> 00:55:50,932
- Earth.
- Earth.

583
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:53,935
It's the least I could do
to repay you for getting us out of here.

584
00:55:56,271 --> 00:55:57,689
Assuming that you can.

585
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:05,363
Deal.

586
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,286
Go on.

587
00:56:11,369 --> 00:56:12,787
You shake it.

588
00:56:12,871 --> 00:56:13,913
As a sign of trust.

589
00:56:17,417 --> 00:56:18,835
Good enough.

590
00:56:24,757 --> 00:56:28,636
Now all I need to do
is get this medallion off Tars Tarkas.

591
00:56:29,888 --> 00:56:31,764
Dotar Sojat?

592
00:56:33,308 --> 00:56:35,351
Useless she-calot.

593
00:56:38,646 --> 00:56:39,814
I told you.

594
00:56:39,939 --> 00:56:41,649
It is forbidden.

595
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:50,408
What in the name of Issus is going on?

596
00:56:50,491 --> 00:56:51,993
Issus has been profaned.

597
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:54,829
We found this one and the red wench
plotting in the temple.

598
00:56:54,996 --> 00:56:56,915
In the temple? How did they get...

599
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,875
Sola led them there.

600
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:01,044
Sola tried to stop us.

601
00:57:01,461 --> 00:57:03,588
I meant no disrespect
to your goddess, Tars.

602
00:57:03,671 --> 00:57:05,006
I'm just trying to get home.

603
00:57:05,089 --> 00:57:07,342
Your right arms were planning
to rob you of the medallion

604
00:57:07,759 --> 00:57:11,346
and use it to commit greater blasphemy
down the River Iss.

605
00:57:11,429 --> 00:57:13,431
They must all die in the arena.

606
00:57:14,432 --> 00:57:17,518
How could you do this?
I spared your life.

607
00:57:18,311 --> 00:57:22,023
I made you Dotar Sojat
yet her life means nothing to you.

608
00:57:22,482 --> 00:57:26,235
You knew... You knew
she had no room for another mark.

609
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:29,530
Now Sola will die because of you.

610
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:34,077
She's your daughter, isn't she?

611
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:43,169
Who told you that?

612
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,129
Call it a father's intuition.

613
00:57:45,380 --> 00:57:47,215
A Thark has no parent but the horde.

614
00:57:47,548 --> 00:57:48,883
But how do you know?

615
00:57:51,260 --> 00:57:53,137
Her mother kept her egg

616
00:57:53,221 --> 00:57:56,182
and Sola's the last flicker
of her ancient greatness.

617
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,892
You can't just stand here
and let her be killed.

618
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,269
Argh!

619
00:58:01,396 --> 00:58:03,106
My right arms offend me.

620
00:58:03,189 --> 00:58:04,857
I Will cut them Off.

621
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:09,654
No.

622
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:14,993
You must hurry. I mean to release you.

623
00:58:16,244 --> 00:58:18,246
I make one condition.

624
00:58:18,705 --> 00:58:21,624
You take Sola with you
down the River Iss.

625
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,917
My Jeddak.

626
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,295
I'd rather you died
in the arms of the Goddess

627
00:58:26,379 --> 00:58:28,965
than as food
for wild banths in the arena.

628
00:58:29,966 --> 00:58:31,926
Where you go, she goes.

629
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:33,511
What's gonna happen to you, Tars?

630
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:37,098
Leave a Thark his head and one hand
and he may yet conquer.

631
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:43,980
Is it done, my Jeddak?

632
00:58:48,609 --> 00:58:50,611
Tars Tarkas betrays us.

633
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:55,116
Woola!

634
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,868
You belong to him.

635
00:58:57,118 --> 00:58:59,620
Woola would follow you
anywhere on Barsoom.

636
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:02,707
It's three days' ride. Follow me.

637
00:59:17,472 --> 00:59:19,432
What happened to this place?

638
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,642
Zodanga happened.

639
01:00:09,690 --> 01:00:11,317
Sailing on light.

640
01:00:14,070 --> 01:00:16,072
Still playing the madman?

641
01:00:17,698 --> 01:00:19,200
Or the liar.

642
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:35,925
Keep moving! We'll get there!

643
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,476
Why pursue this wedding
any longer? I've already won.

644
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:48,604
Not yet. You must aim past the horizon,
Sab Than.

645
01:00:49,063 --> 01:00:53,067
To truly demoralize a nation requires a
public spectacle on the grandest scale.

646
01:00:53,151 --> 01:00:56,237
Staging this wedding will ensure
your rule goes unchallenged.

647
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,947
If you insist.

648
01:00:58,406 --> 01:01:02,326
If you cannot see the wisdom in that,
then we will find another who can.

649
01:01:17,049 --> 01:01:19,051
Dotar Sojat.

650
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,346
Carter!

651
01:01:22,430 --> 01:01:24,390
I do not think she leads us to the Iss.

652
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:33,232
All right, then, Sola.

653
01:01:33,399 --> 01:01:35,401
Just play along.

654
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,740
What do you think I'd do
once I saw your city and not some river?

655
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:42,700
- What do you mean?
- Cluros and Thuria.

656
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,286
They should be at our backs by now.

657
01:01:45,369 --> 01:01:47,246
You lead us toward Helium!

658
01:01:51,417 --> 01:01:53,252
Once we reach there,

659
01:01:53,836 --> 01:01:56,380
you would see for yourself
the virtue of our cause.

660
01:01:57,757 --> 01:02:01,260
Everyone thinks
their cause is virtuous... Professor.

661
01:02:01,761 --> 01:02:03,471
What are you doing?

662
01:02:08,392 --> 01:02:09,560
No!

663
01:02:09,810 --> 01:02:11,312
John Carter!

664
01:02:11,812 --> 01:02:13,439
You can't!

665
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:14,899
I like this plan better.

666
01:02:15,274 --> 01:02:16,817
Just wait.

667
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:18,319
She'll come around.

668
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:20,363
You mad fool!

669
01:02:20,571 --> 01:02:23,824
You're not from Earth!
There are no Therns!

670
01:02:24,158 --> 01:02:26,786
I only told you what you wanted to hear
so you'd get us out!

671
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:28,913
Stop!

672
01:02:28,996 --> 01:02:29,997
I can't!

673
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:32,416
I cannot marry him!

674
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:37,713
Can't marry who?

675
01:02:40,258 --> 01:02:42,343
The Zodangan Jeddak you fought.

676
01:02:42,426 --> 01:02:44,428
Sab Than.

677
01:02:44,679 --> 01:02:47,932
He offered a truce to my father
in exchange for my hand.

678
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:49,976
Your father?

679
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:52,103
Tardos Mors.

680
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:55,356
The Jeddak of Helium.
She is a princess!

681
01:02:57,275 --> 01:02:58,776
A princess of Mars.

682
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,362
How about that?

683
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:06,450
A princess who didn't want
to get married, so she ran away.

684
01:03:06,617 --> 01:03:08,035
No.

685
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:10,871
Is that all there is to the story?

686
01:03:11,038 --> 01:03:13,833
No, I didn't run away!

687
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:17,253
- I escaped!
- From what, his breath?

688
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:19,547
So marry the guy and save your people.

689
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:22,216
A life of oppression! That's not living!

690
01:03:32,518 --> 01:03:34,478
If you had the means to save others,

691
01:03:34,562 --> 01:03:37,231
would you not take
any action possible to make it so?

692
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:41,027
No good will come
out of me fighting your war.

693
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:45,740
I would lay down my life for Helium.

694
01:03:50,578 --> 01:03:53,247
Yes, I ran away.

695
01:03:53,706 --> 01:03:55,708
I was afraid,

696
01:03:56,709 --> 01:03:58,085
weak.

697
01:04:00,921 --> 01:04:02,923
Maybe I should have married.

698
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:10,765
But I so feared that it would somehow
be the end of Barsoom.

699
01:04:14,602 --> 01:04:18,064
I tell you truly, John Carter of Earth,

700
01:04:19,732 --> 01:04:21,609
there are no Gates of Iss.

701
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:23,903
They are not real.

702
01:04:31,285 --> 01:04:33,287
I'm sorry, Princess.

703
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:39,126
But this, this is real.

704
01:04:43,464 --> 01:04:45,466
And so is my cave of gold.

705
01:04:57,645 --> 01:04:59,688
Prudence demands you take an escort.

706
01:04:59,772 --> 01:05:01,065
No.

707
01:05:01,148 --> 01:05:03,150
I go alone, General.

708
01:05:04,485 --> 01:05:05,569
But, Jeddak...

709
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:08,948
In one sweep, I can
put an end to 1,000 years of civil war

710
01:05:09,031 --> 01:05:11,158
and bring Helium to its knees forever.

711
01:05:11,909 --> 01:05:16,372
But my general, in his superior wisdom,
objects. Is that right?

712
01:05:20,668 --> 01:05:22,711
I'm starting to talk like you.

713
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,474
<i>Hekkador, they have reached the Iss.</i>

714
01:05:35,558 --> 01:05:37,059
It took them longer than I thought.

715
01:05:37,143 --> 01:05:38,185
<i>If they reach the Gates...</i>

716
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:39,478
<i>They can breach the sanctuary.</i>

717
01:05:39,562 --> 01:05:41,480
<i>Her knowledge
of the Ninth Ray is already...</i>

718
01:05:41,564 --> 01:05:43,399
As advanced as it will ever be.

719
01:05:43,482 --> 01:05:44,650
Patience, brothers.

720
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:46,902
It is under my control.

721
01:05:47,945 --> 01:05:49,697
I'm already there.

722
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,963
The Iss.

723
01:06:06,297 --> 01:06:09,175
Here, pilgrims must leave
behind all they have,

724
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:13,179
all they know,

725
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:15,014
never to return.

726
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:20,436
May the Goddess find me worthy.

727
01:06:28,152 --> 01:06:29,487
Wait!

728
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:33,407
What do you think you're doing?

729
01:06:33,824 --> 01:06:36,911
It is my way, Dotar Sojat, not yours.

730
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:39,997
I must honor my Jeddak
and redeem my unworthiness!

731
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:43,542
You want to honor your father?
Then stay alive and help me.

732
01:06:47,087 --> 01:06:48,506
My father?

733
01:06:50,758 --> 01:06:52,009
Sola...

734
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,762
Why would you say that?

735
01:06:55,137 --> 01:06:57,223
That's what drives your compassion,

736
01:06:57,765 --> 01:07:00,893
the blood of your father, Tars Tarkas.

737
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:05,940
And of all the Tharks,
you're the only one worthy of him.

738
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:19,828
Your duty to your father
demands that you see me through.

739
01:07:22,039 --> 01:07:24,041
Just help me find the Gates.

740
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:27,002
Then you can decide
what honor requires.

741
01:07:31,382 --> 01:07:33,300
Just to the Gates, then.

742
01:07:35,970 --> 01:07:37,805
Woola, stay!

743
01:08:14,341 --> 01:08:16,343
Other pilgrims.

744
01:08:29,523 --> 01:08:30,774
Professor.

745
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:36,697
Impossible.

746
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:46,290
I've never seen
this kind of structure before.

747
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:50,711
I want to get a better look.

748
01:09:05,643 --> 01:09:08,062
Carter, your feet.

749
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:01,949
This is not the work of gods.

750
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:05,953
These are machines.

751
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:19,842
Your medallion.

752
01:10:41,780 --> 01:10:43,782
A spider.

753
01:10:51,790 --> 01:10:52,916
Nine.

754
01:10:54,293 --> 01:10:55,794
Nine rays.

755
01:10:56,587 --> 01:10:57,838
Nine.

756
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,423
The Ninth Ray is real.

757
01:10:59,506 --> 01:11:00,883
It can be harnessed. Do you see?

758
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:03,844
This entire structure runs
on Ninth Ray isolates.

759
01:11:04,636 --> 01:11:06,597
Mother Issus!

760
01:11:06,805 --> 01:11:08,807
Such power.

761
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:12,352
And somehow Zodanga has it.

762
01:11:16,607 --> 01:11:18,609
The Therns.

763
01:11:20,027 --> 01:11:22,029
They must be real.

764
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:23,697
And you

765
01:11:27,284 --> 01:11:29,495
are John Carter of Earth?

766
01:11:31,205 --> 01:11:32,581
Yes, ma'am.

767
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,129
And the ships

768
01:11:40,172 --> 01:11:42,174
that sail on the sea.

769
01:11:44,218 --> 01:11:46,220
You've seen them.

770
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,432
That must be a beautiful sight.

771
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:52,518
It truly is.

772
01:12:01,318 --> 01:12:03,654
It's our solar system.

773
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:18,794
- What's it say?
- I'm not sure.

774
01:12:18,877 --> 01:12:20,462
What do you think it says?

775
01:12:20,546 --> 01:12:23,966
It appears to be
a kind of technical diagram.

776
01:12:24,758 --> 01:12:27,261
Here is Barsoom. There is Jasoom.

777
01:12:28,136 --> 01:12:29,346
This glyph here,

778
01:12:29,429 --> 01:12:33,350
it's like our symbol
for a transcription, a copy,

779
01:12:33,767 --> 01:12:36,854
sent along these lines here,
between the worlds.

780
01:12:36,937 --> 01:12:38,146
Like...

781
01:12:38,230 --> 01:12:40,232
A telegram.

782
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:43,151
You're saying I was telegraphed here.

783
01:12:44,444 --> 01:12:46,405
I'm a copy of myself.

784
01:12:46,488 --> 01:12:50,367
Possibly, making these words
here the command for travel.

785
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,666
I don't like guessing.

786
01:12:57,791 --> 01:13:00,836
I need more information.
I need charts, codices.

787
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:03,505
Right.

788
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:05,591
And where might we find those?

789
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,428
In the Hall of Science.

790
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:13,181
And where's that?

791
01:13:13,932 --> 01:13:15,392
Helium.

792
01:13:15,642 --> 01:13:19,479
Then quick, let's just head on
and turn on back to Helium.

793
01:13:19,855 --> 01:13:20,981
What do you take me for?

794
01:13:21,064 --> 01:13:23,400
I take you for a man who's lost.

795
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:26,028
I won't be lost if you just tell me
how to work this thing!

796
01:13:26,111 --> 01:13:27,154
I will!

797
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:29,990
But everything I need to understand
that medallion is in Helium.

798
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,993
I'm trying to get you back
to your cave of gold.

799
01:13:33,243 --> 01:13:34,620
Isn't that what you want?

800
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:36,038
Yes.

801
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:40,542
No.

802
01:13:42,127 --> 01:13:44,129
I don't believe you.

803
01:13:45,422 --> 01:13:47,716
We may have been born worlds apart,

804
01:13:50,177 --> 01:13:52,888
but I know you, John Carter.

805
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:57,434
From the moment
you caught me in the sky, I knew.

806
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:02,898
I felt the heart of a man
willing to lay down his life for others,

807
01:14:05,150 --> 01:14:07,819
a man willing to fight for a cause.

808
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,573
Here.

809
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:15,202
On Barsoom.

810
01:14:36,974 --> 01:14:39,226
Don't you see, Carter?

811
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,647
I fled to find another way.

812
01:14:49,778 --> 01:14:52,114
You are the other way.

813
01:14:55,075 --> 01:14:57,077
Dotar Sojat!

814
01:15:06,420 --> 01:15:07,921
Warhoon!

815
01:15:18,265 --> 01:15:19,599
Dotar Sojat!

816
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:28,942
Pursue them to the Aoolian Plain.

817
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:32,112
Then overtake them
and capture the red woman alive.

818
01:15:32,446 --> 01:15:34,364
The one who jumps?

819
01:15:34,448 --> 01:15:36,408
Let's see what he's capable of.

820
01:16:26,625 --> 01:16:27,834
Sarah!

821
01:16:32,798 --> 01:16:34,758
- Whoa!
- Dotar Sojat!

822
01:16:34,841 --> 01:16:37,344
- What are you doing?
- Sola, get her out of here.

823
01:16:37,427 --> 01:16:39,513
Carter!

824
01:16:39,638 --> 01:16:41,556
I was too late once.

825
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,642
I won't be again.

826
01:16:43,767 --> 01:16:45,727
No! No!

827
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,355
No!

828
01:16:49,356 --> 01:16:50,857
No!

829
01:16:54,528 --> 01:16:55,862
Woola, go.

830
01:16:57,364 --> 01:16:58,615
Go, damn you!

831
01:18:22,407 --> 01:18:23,575
Father!

832
01:18:26,661 --> 01:18:28,455
Thank the Goddess!

833
01:18:28,622 --> 01:18:29,789
Carter.

834
01:18:34,461 --> 01:18:36,046
Oh, thank Issus.

835
01:18:36,129 --> 01:18:37,464
Who is he?

836
01:18:37,631 --> 01:18:40,508
His name's John Carter.
He saved my life.

837
01:18:43,178 --> 01:18:44,763
He's from Jasoom.

838
01:18:46,139 --> 01:18:47,265
Jasoom!

839
01:18:47,891 --> 01:18:50,977
Zodanga's closer.
He'll have my personal physician.

840
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,688
He shot me out of the sky!

841
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:55,815
Daughter, listen to me! Listen.

842
01:18:56,650 --> 01:18:58,818
Sab has admitted to everything.

843
01:18:59,277 --> 01:19:01,905
He came to me, alone,
without an escort.

844
01:19:02,656 --> 01:19:03,865
I could have had him imprisoned.

845
01:19:03,949 --> 01:19:05,742
I could have had him killed.

846
01:19:05,867 --> 01:19:08,328
Yet, it was clear he only cared
about your safety.

847
01:19:08,745 --> 01:19:12,999
I feared you'd be tortured by the Tharks
and condemned to die in their arena.

848
01:19:14,459 --> 01:19:16,711
I could not live with that
on my conscience.

849
01:19:17,003 --> 01:19:18,380
I do have one, Princess.

850
01:19:19,256 --> 01:19:20,340
Really?

851
01:19:20,423 --> 01:19:22,384
I thought you had it
removed along with...

852
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,595
She does not trust me, Jeddak.

853
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,222
And why should she?

854
01:19:27,347 --> 01:19:30,100
There's never been trust
between Zodanga and Helium.

855
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:31,935
Therefore, Princess,

856
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:34,938
I offer you this small
but sincere token of my goodwill.

857
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:43,863
My life.

858
01:19:54,374 --> 01:19:56,376
You hold the power, Princess.

859
01:19:57,294 --> 01:20:01,214
The power of life over me
and over all Barsoom.

860
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:06,678
With our two cities united,
anything is possible.

861
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:11,349
All you have to do is marry me.

862
01:20:44,007 --> 01:20:45,342
Is this Helium?

863
01:20:45,508 --> 01:20:47,302
No.

864
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:54,142
Ah, Zodanga, where the men
are as limited as the menu

865
01:20:54,768 --> 01:20:57,687
and the women are as hard as the beds.

866
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:59,606
What's your business here?

867
01:20:59,856 --> 01:21:01,191
He is my business.

868
01:21:01,274 --> 01:21:04,194
The Jasoomian is to be taken
to more secure accommodation.

869
01:21:04,277 --> 01:21:06,029
We've received no such orders!

870
01:21:06,237 --> 01:21:07,614
You're receiving them now!

871
01:21:08,615 --> 01:21:11,618
Straight from the laughing lips
of Sab Than himself.

872
01:21:14,204 --> 01:21:19,667
I hear that you
are incredibly dangerous.

873
01:21:20,293 --> 01:21:21,795
Take me hostage.

874
01:21:22,462 --> 01:21:24,839
- What?
- Take me hostage.

875
01:21:27,467 --> 01:21:28,968
Are you all right?

876
01:21:32,138 --> 01:21:34,224
No! The white imbecile
has taken my sword!

877
01:21:39,062 --> 01:21:40,355
Guards!

878
01:21:41,815 --> 01:21:42,941
Carter! Run!

879
01:21:43,441 --> 01:21:46,236
There's a crazy man
running amok with a sword!

880
01:21:46,319 --> 01:21:47,320
Carter, this way!

881
01:21:53,910 --> 01:21:55,620
Right, your turn.

882
01:21:55,829 --> 01:21:57,497
- My turn?
- Yeah.

883
01:21:57,705 --> 01:22:00,083
- Who are you?
- My name is Kantos Kan.

884
01:22:00,166 --> 01:22:01,709
I serve Princess Dejah.

885
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:03,086
- Dejah?
- Uh-huh.

886
01:22:03,169 --> 01:22:08,508
And from what she tells me,
you can get us over there.

887
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:15,849
She said I could make that?

888
01:22:17,183 --> 01:22:18,518
We could always surrender.

889
01:22:18,643 --> 01:22:19,602
Quickly!

890
01:22:19,686 --> 01:22:21,688
Is that what you do on Jasoom?

891
01:22:22,605 --> 01:22:24,274
Come on!

892
01:22:41,124 --> 01:22:42,250
Hello, ladies.

893
01:22:54,637 --> 01:22:57,807
You are expected
to bow in my presence, Captain Carter.

894
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:02,687
Bow.

895
01:23:08,151 --> 01:23:10,153
I suppose that will do.

896
01:23:12,363 --> 01:23:14,365
I fetched him, as you commanded.

897
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:15,825
Thank you, Kantos.

898
01:23:15,909 --> 01:23:18,495
I wish to speak to Captain Carter alone.

899
01:23:19,078 --> 01:23:20,413
Keep watch outside.

900
01:23:23,208 --> 01:23:25,210
Now, girls. Off you go!

901
01:23:39,682 --> 01:23:41,184
You look beautiful.

902
01:23:41,267 --> 01:23:43,311
It's traditional Zodangan,

903
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,313
worn by the groom's mother, I'm told.

904
01:23:46,189 --> 01:23:47,524
A little vulgar for my taste,

905
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:49,609
but my opinions
are about to become irrelevant.

906
01:23:49,776 --> 01:23:51,778
You can't seriously be considering this.

907
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:54,197
- What other choice do I have?
- Don't marry him.

908
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:56,282
Give me a reason not to.

909
01:23:58,076 --> 01:24:00,078
Will you stay and fight for Helium?

910
01:24:02,956 --> 01:24:06,292
Will you stay and fight for Helium?

911
01:24:18,888 --> 01:24:19,931
Dejah.

912
01:24:21,724 --> 01:24:23,851
We have a saying on Barsoom.

913
01:24:25,645 --> 01:24:30,441
A warrior may change his metal,
but not his heart.

914
01:24:35,321 --> 01:24:36,823
You were right.

915
01:24:39,242 --> 01:24:41,160
I could decipher the command.

916
01:24:42,161 --> 01:24:43,538
It's a set of sounds.

917
01:24:44,831 --> 01:24:46,833
A simple phrase.

918
01:24:48,418 --> 01:24:50,336
Repeat after me.

919
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,548
Ock, ohem, ocktei...

920
01:24:53,923 --> 01:24:55,925
Open the door!

921
01:24:59,262 --> 01:25:02,181
Say it now. Ock, ohem, ocktei.

922
01:25:03,850 --> 01:25:06,436
Are you all right, Dejah?

923
01:25:06,519 --> 01:25:07,520
Ock,

924
01:25:07,604 --> 01:25:09,606
ohem,

925
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:14,360
ocktei.

926
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:15,570
Wies.

927
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:20,825
- Wies.
- Jasoom.

928
01:25:21,034 --> 01:25:22,619
Jasoom. Say it.

929
01:25:22,702 --> 01:25:24,662
- Say it. Say it!
- Ja...

930
01:25:25,955 --> 01:25:28,041
Dejah? Are you alone?

931
01:25:40,345 --> 01:25:41,888
Yes.

932
01:25:44,057 --> 01:25:45,850
I am alone.

933
01:25:51,856 --> 01:25:53,858
Well, my Jeddak.

934
01:25:55,234 --> 01:25:57,236
The moons will soon be rising.

935
01:25:58,863 --> 01:26:01,240
Let us not delay
the proceedings any further.

936
01:26:04,535 --> 01:26:05,870
Yes.

937
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:09,082
Yes, of course.

938
01:26:46,285 --> 01:26:47,787
Ssh.

939
01:26:49,414 --> 01:26:51,416
We'll have plenty of time to talk.

940
01:26:56,796 --> 01:26:57,797
Now.

941
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,762
Who are you?

942
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:07,432
- American.
- Who are you, sir?

943
01:27:09,142 --> 01:27:11,811
"Sir." Definitely the South.

944
01:27:13,146 --> 01:27:15,398
The Carolinas? Virginia?

945
01:27:17,108 --> 01:27:19,068
It's Virginia, isn't it?

946
01:27:19,152 --> 01:27:21,487
- Lovely place.
- Do you know it?

947
01:27:21,571 --> 01:27:24,615
Not as well as I should. But I will.

948
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:32,915
Padwar, what's the hold-up?

949
01:27:32,999 --> 01:27:34,792
Sorry, sir. The streets are blocked.

950
01:27:34,876 --> 01:27:36,169
It's the wedding procession.

951
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:42,842
Increased strength and agility.

952
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:46,429
Simple matter
of gravitation and anatomy,

953
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:48,097
one we ought to have foreseen.

954
01:27:48,264 --> 01:27:49,640
We?

955
01:27:50,349 --> 01:27:52,685
No apparent increase in intelligence.

956
01:27:53,519 --> 01:27:56,898
Still, this Will not do at all.

957
01:27:57,857 --> 01:28:00,860
We can't have Earthmen
projecting themselves over here,

958
01:28:00,985 --> 01:28:03,696
leaping about, causing
all manner of disruption.

959
01:28:05,406 --> 01:28:06,991
You're a Thern.

960
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:09,285
Therns are a myth.

961
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:12,538
Padwar, we'll go on foot.

962
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:13,790
Yes, sir.

963
01:28:23,633 --> 01:28:27,386
My name is Matai Shang,
and I do not exist.

964
01:28:28,763 --> 01:28:31,224
Indeed, I work very hard at it.

965
01:28:34,060 --> 01:28:36,896
Excuse me, excuse me.

966
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:45,863
Many pardons, many pardons.

967
01:29:01,712 --> 01:29:03,172
It's a shame, really.

968
01:29:03,256 --> 01:29:06,717
She's a remarkable creature,
and she came very close indeed.

969
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:09,136
You mean the Ninth Ray.

970
01:29:11,389 --> 01:29:13,391
It's of no consequence now.

971
01:29:14,058 --> 01:29:15,726
After tonight's ceremony,

972
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:19,105
when the two moons meet
and vows are exchanged,

973
01:29:19,564 --> 01:29:22,191
she and anyone else with
knowledge of the Ninth Ray

974
01:29:22,275 --> 01:29:24,277
will be eliminated.

975
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:27,405
In effect, cutting the head off the beast.

976
01:29:28,114 --> 01:29:31,075
Quick, clean and precise.

977
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:37,206
Shame there's no one to warn her.

978
01:29:53,306 --> 01:29:55,308
The balance must be restored.

979
01:30:03,649 --> 01:30:05,526
What gives you the right to interfere?

980
01:30:05,610 --> 01:30:08,529
What do you care?
This is not your home.

981
01:30:08,988 --> 01:30:11,574
You have no obligation to these people.

982
01:30:13,284 --> 01:30:15,620
You don't have a dog in this fight.

983
01:30:15,995 --> 01:30:18,164
Is that how you would say it in Virginia?

984
01:30:18,789 --> 01:30:20,291
Man without a cause.

985
01:30:30,843 --> 01:30:32,845
So what is your cause?

986
01:30:35,723 --> 01:30:37,725
We have none.

987
01:30:38,809 --> 01:30:41,520
We're not haunted by mortality
as you are.

988
01:30:43,356 --> 01:30:45,983
We are eternal.

989
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:48,611
I don't understand.

990
01:30:48,694 --> 01:30:50,863
The wedding, this little stroll.

991
01:30:51,822 --> 01:30:53,991
Why not just kill me, kill Dejah?

992
01:30:54,075 --> 01:30:57,203
History will follow
the course we have set, Earthman.

993
01:30:57,912 --> 01:31:00,414
And we've chosen
Sab Than to rule next.

994
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:04,168
The Ninth Ray
must remain in the hands

995
01:31:04,251 --> 01:31:06,545
of mindless brutes we can control.

996
01:31:08,547 --> 01:31:12,343
And the infamy of Dejah Thoris's
wedding death will seal his reign.

997
01:31:14,679 --> 01:31:17,890
We've been playing this game
since before the birth of this planet.

998
01:31:18,057 --> 01:31:21,310
And we'll continue to do so,
long after the death of yours.

999
01:31:23,396 --> 01:31:26,691
We don't cause the destruction
of a world, Captain Carter.

1000
01:31:27,483 --> 01:31:29,485
We simply manage it,

1001
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:32,238
feed off it, if you like.

1002
01:31:33,823 --> 01:31:37,576
But on every host planet, it always
plays out exactly the same way.

1003
01:31:38,577 --> 01:31:42,415
Populations rise, societies divide,

1004
01:31:43,582 --> 01:31:45,584
wars spread.

1005
01:31:47,086 --> 01:31:49,088
And all the while

1006
01:31:49,880 --> 01:31:52,508
the neglected planet slowly fades.

1007
01:32:00,558 --> 01:32:03,811
Prep a two-man flier immediately
for prisoner transport.

1008
01:32:03,894 --> 01:32:05,604
Yes, sir.

1009
01:32:15,948 --> 01:32:17,116
Argh!

1010
01:32:22,038 --> 01:32:23,289
Immortal ain't bulletproof.

1011
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:25,791
I shot one of you back on Earth.

1012
01:32:32,214 --> 01:32:33,799
Oh, come on.

1013
01:32:39,472 --> 01:32:41,891
I'm trying! I'm Wing!

1014
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:44,101
Guards! After him!

1015
01:33:53,170 --> 01:33:55,172
Ohh, Woola!

1016
01:33:56,090 --> 01:33:58,676
I told you Woola would
follow you anywhere.

1017
01:34:00,177 --> 01:34:02,179
He did a lot more than just that.

1018
01:34:05,182 --> 01:34:06,892
Wait! Wait!

1019
01:34:06,976 --> 01:34:08,561
Where are you going?

1020
01:34:08,686 --> 01:34:10,312
To save Dejah.

1021
01:34:10,396 --> 01:34:11,522
And I'll need an army to do it.

1022
01:34:12,898 --> 01:34:14,066
Get on.

1023
01:34:15,109 --> 01:34:17,820
No! Tharks do not fly.

1024
01:34:40,301 --> 01:34:42,011
<i>Gayor.</i>

1025
01:34:51,312 --> 01:34:52,938
Tars! They're going to kill

1026
01:34:55,149 --> 01:34:56,442
Dejah.

1027
01:34:56,775 --> 01:34:59,403
Issus truly rewards the just.

1028
01:35:13,667 --> 01:35:15,419
- I see the dead.
- Tars?

1029
01:35:18,464 --> 01:35:20,466
The Virginia I knew

1030
01:35:22,176 --> 01:35:24,178
traveled the Iss.

1031
01:35:26,305 --> 01:35:27,306
What have they done to you?

1032
01:35:28,557 --> 01:35:30,559
Tal challenged.

1033
01:35:31,268 --> 01:35:32,436
I lost.

1034
01:35:34,605 --> 01:35:36,190
Virginia.

1035
01:35:37,316 --> 01:35:40,152
When I saw you leap into the sky,

1036
01:35:40,986 --> 01:35:43,989
I wished to believe it was a sign

1037
01:35:44,240 --> 01:35:47,201
that something new
can come into this world,

1038
01:35:48,035 --> 01:35:52,957
that the greatness of our Thark race
might rise again.

1039
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:57,002
But it is too late.

1040
01:35:59,296 --> 01:36:01,298
- Tars.
- No matter.

1041
01:36:02,049 --> 01:36:04,468
My daughter is with
her mother in Paradise.

1042
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:06,553
There is comfort in that.

1043
01:36:09,265 --> 01:36:11,809
Tars, it's Sola.

1044
01:36:14,478 --> 01:36:16,480
Actually, she's here with me.

1045
01:36:16,814 --> 01:36:17,815
Argh!

1046
01:36:21,944 --> 01:36:25,531
This is how you repay your debt to me?

1047
01:36:25,614 --> 01:36:26,907
I need my sword.

1048
01:36:26,991 --> 01:36:30,119
Then it would harvest
your thoughtless head from your body!

1049
01:36:43,966 --> 01:36:45,968
Up now! We go!

1050
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:52,516
It is done.

1051
01:36:52,599 --> 01:36:54,059
Nonsense.

1052
01:36:54,143 --> 01:36:57,521
"Leave a Thark his head and one hand,
and he may yet conquer."

1053
01:36:57,604 --> 01:36:59,023
Right?

1054
01:36:59,106 --> 01:37:01,108
Your spirit annoys me.

1055
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:19,835
All this your work?

1056
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:22,046
Banths.

1057
01:37:29,261 --> 01:37:30,637
Weakness.

1058
01:37:30,721 --> 01:37:32,681
Sentiment.

1059
01:37:32,765 --> 01:37:37,394
Allowing this white worm
to contaminate the horde.

1060
01:37:38,479 --> 01:37:41,648
These are the crimes of Tars Tarkas.

1061
01:37:43,525 --> 01:37:46,737
We are united
because we cull our freaks.

1062
01:37:48,030 --> 01:37:51,367
We are strong
because we despise weakness.

1063
01:37:57,289 --> 01:38:01,877
Let them be crushed
like unhatched eggs.

1064
01:38:19,186 --> 01:38:20,938
Is that a banth?

1065
01:38:21,063 --> 01:38:22,398
No.

1066
01:38:22,481 --> 01:38:24,191
It is a white ape.

1067
01:38:26,318 --> 01:38:28,320
- Run!

1068
01:38:30,489 --> 01:38:33,117
Tars! Get up! Tars!

1069
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:35,035
Give me your hand!
You have four damn hands!

1070
01:38:35,119 --> 01:38:36,286
Give me one!

1071
01:38:40,457 --> 01:38:42,459
- Father!
- Father?

1072
01:38:46,880 --> 01:38:48,590
Tars! Tars!

1073
01:38:49,425 --> 01:38:50,634
Hey!

1074
01:38:52,219 --> 01:38:55,681
Hey! Hey, over here, you blind monkey!

1075
01:39:14,700 --> 01:39:16,702
Release the other one.

1076
01:39:34,178 --> 01:39:38,015
Watch your father die
like the whimpering calot he is!

1077
01:39:40,100 --> 01:39:42,311
No! Let us watch you!

1078
01:39:51,236 --> 01:39:53,739
Sola! Are you mad?

1079
01:39:53,822 --> 01:39:56,533
No. The blood of my father drives me.

1080
01:40:51,004 --> 01:40:52,047
Sola!

1081
01:41:21,326 --> 01:41:24,329
Virginia! Virginia!
Virginia! Virginia!

1082
01:41:32,838 --> 01:41:35,507
I claim the right of challenge!

1083
01:41:42,097 --> 01:41:44,057
You have no right to challenge!

1084
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:45,767
You are not Thark!

1085
01:41:46,602 --> 01:41:48,604
He is Thark!

1086
01:41:48,687 --> 01:41:51,106
He is Dotar Sojat!

1087
01:41:51,607 --> 01:41:55,944
Dotar Sojat! Dotar Sojat!

1088
01:41:56,361 --> 01:42:00,198
Dotar Sojat! Dotar Sojat!

1089
01:42:04,036 --> 01:42:06,455
Who will pledge their metal to mine?

1090
01:42:41,281 --> 01:42:45,452
The Jeddak of Zodanga
means to crush Helium this very night.

1091
01:42:45,911 --> 01:42:47,913
And if Helium falls,

1092
01:42:49,665 --> 01:42:51,667
so does Barsoom.

1093
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:55,087
We must throw off
the yoke of old hatreds.

1094
01:42:56,088 --> 01:42:57,923
Tharks did not cause this.

1095
01:42:59,257 --> 01:43:02,427
But, by Issus, Tharks will end it!

1096
01:43:06,848 --> 01:43:08,934
We ride for Zodanga!

1097
01:43:33,041 --> 01:43:36,294
I know that this is not the fate
you would have chosen for yourself,

1098
01:43:36,795 --> 01:43:38,255
or for Helium,

1099
01:43:38,338 --> 01:43:42,134
but choice is a luxury
even for a Jeddak of Barsoom.

1100
01:43:43,635 --> 01:43:45,387
Even if, in your heart...

1101
01:43:45,470 --> 01:43:47,472
A heart is a luxury.

1102
01:43:51,476 --> 01:43:52,978
Steady.

1103
01:43:55,647 --> 01:43:57,649
Remember, she is not the prize.

1104
01:43:59,901 --> 01:44:01,903
The prize is Barsoom.

1105
01:44:23,550 --> 01:44:24,843
You!

1106
01:44:24,926 --> 01:44:26,720
Why is Zodanga undefended?

1107
01:44:27,179 --> 01:44:28,680
Where is everyone?

1108
01:44:28,764 --> 01:44:31,266
The army has been repositioned
outside Helium.

1109
01:44:31,349 --> 01:44:33,143
Only a small contingent remains.

1110
01:44:33,226 --> 01:44:35,353
Sab and Dejah Thoris. Where are they?

1111
01:44:36,021 --> 01:44:38,356
They're at the wedding in Helium!

1112
01:44:38,648 --> 01:44:40,150
Helium?

1113
01:45:00,045 --> 01:45:02,339
No! I have made my decision.

1114
01:45:02,422 --> 01:45:04,174
It's the only way to get there in time.

1115
01:45:04,549 --> 01:45:06,802
Tharks do not fly.

1116
01:45:08,553 --> 01:45:09,888
So be it.

1117
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:18,480
This is madness, Dotar Sojat. You'll die!

1118
01:45:21,233 --> 01:45:23,401
Then I'll see you down the River Iss.

1119
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,696
Follow the canal!

1120
01:45:26,780 --> 01:45:29,825
Be careful!
The moonlight will force you to fly low!

1121
01:45:40,669 --> 01:45:43,338
Like our ancestors before us,

1122
01:45:43,839 --> 01:45:48,593
we gather under the mingled light
of Barsoom's first lovers,

1123
01:45:49,135 --> 01:45:51,555
Cluros and Thuria.

1124
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:19,124
As the moons
are joined in celestial union,

1125
01:46:19,207 --> 01:46:23,670
so do we unite
Sab Than and Dejah Thoris,

1126
01:46:24,254 --> 01:46:27,007
Zodanga and Helium.

1127
01:46:41,688 --> 01:46:43,815
No! You'll raise the alarm.
It's one of ours.

1128
01:46:53,867 --> 01:46:55,410
In the time of oceans,

1129
01:46:55,493 --> 01:46:58,830
the celestial lovers
rose from the sea each night

1130
01:46:58,914 --> 01:47:00,874
to consummate their love in the sky.

1131
01:47:00,999 --> 01:47:04,336
Drink now
of this holy water and be wed.

1132
01:47:04,419 --> 01:47:06,421
So may it be again.

1133
01:47:07,839 --> 01:47:09,841
I am yours forever.

1134
01:47:16,932 --> 01:47:18,934
And I am yours

1135
01:47:21,061 --> 01:47:22,187
forever.

1136
01:47:28,026 --> 01:47:29,235
Carter!

1137
01:47:31,237 --> 01:47:33,323
It's a trap! Zodanga's at your walls!

1138
01:47:33,406 --> 01:47:34,741
Now! Do it now!

1139
01:47:34,866 --> 01:47:37,243
- No!
- Helium falls!

1140
01:47:54,260 --> 01:47:56,096
Zodanga!

1141
01:48:12,195 --> 01:48:13,196
Dejah!

1142
01:48:14,322 --> 01:48:15,407
Argh!

1143
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:23,748
If you'll just get behind me, sir.

1144
01:48:30,171 --> 01:48:31,631
Carter!

1145
01:48:44,936 --> 01:48:47,272
- It was such a nice wedding.
- Yeah, that.

1146
01:48:57,949 --> 01:49:00,035
Helium's fate is sealed, Earthman.

1147
01:49:00,118 --> 01:49:01,619
As is yours.

1148
01:49:10,462 --> 01:49:12,464
Thank the Goddess that's over with.

1149
01:49:21,306 --> 01:49:22,849
Virginia!

1150
01:49:28,146 --> 01:49:29,856
It is good to fly!

1151
01:49:34,527 --> 01:49:36,488
By Issus, they fight with us!

1152
01:49:54,839 --> 01:49:55,840
Brother!

1153
01:49:55,924 --> 01:49:57,926
Heliumite, huh?

1154
01:50:15,193 --> 01:50:17,570
You're going to tell me everything
you know about the Therns.

1155
01:50:17,654 --> 01:50:20,615
You spare me and I'll tell you.

1156
01:50:51,020 --> 01:50:55,358
A fitting solution for your setback,
wouldn't you say, Captain?

1157
01:50:56,901 --> 01:50:58,486
Dejah Thoris survives her assassins

1158
01:50:58,570 --> 01:51:00,155
but will fail to prove
her misguided theory

1159
01:51:00,238 --> 01:51:02,240
of the Ninth Ray.

1160
01:51:02,323 --> 01:51:03,658
Yes.

1161
01:51:04,409 --> 01:51:06,411
I'll enjoy playing that out.

1162
01:51:06,786 --> 01:51:08,079
Carter!

1163
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:13,001
Dejah!

1164
01:51:14,752 --> 01:51:16,171
I'm getting away!

1165
01:51:31,269 --> 01:51:32,353
Tars.

1166
01:51:32,478 --> 01:51:34,022
The medallion.

1167
01:51:34,606 --> 01:51:36,274
Give it to me, my Jeddak.

1168
01:51:44,324 --> 01:51:45,450
No!

1169
01:52:05,178 --> 01:52:06,763
I'll explain later.

1170
01:52:13,811 --> 01:52:16,564
You have won, my Jeddak.

1171
01:52:18,983 --> 01:52:20,818
All is finished.

1172
01:52:25,490 --> 01:52:26,950
Not quite.

1173
01:52:35,875 --> 01:52:37,418
A Jeddak.

1174
01:52:37,502 --> 01:52:39,504
I see you have changed your metal.

1175
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:43,383
And my heart.

1176
01:52:53,893 --> 01:52:55,353
Dejah Thoris,

1177
01:52:58,523 --> 01:53:01,359
would a princess of Mars
ever consider marriage

1178
01:53:01,442 --> 01:53:05,071
to a wayward Virginia cavalryman

1179
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:09,617
with nothing to offer?

1180
01:53:09,701 --> 01:53:10,910
Yes,

1181
01:53:12,954 --> 01:53:14,956
John Carter.

1182
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:17,375
Yes!

1183
01:53:26,092 --> 01:53:29,012
By the ancient rite
of moons and water

1184
01:53:30,430 --> 01:53:32,432
are you bound together,

1185
01:53:34,392 --> 01:53:36,394
husband and wife.

1186
01:54:02,503 --> 01:54:04,505
John?

1187
01:54:26,819 --> 01:54:28,946
Homesick for the Thark nursery?

1188
01:54:30,448 --> 01:54:32,533
I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep.

1189
01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:36,120
I had that feeling you get, suddenly,

1190
01:54:37,872 --> 01:54:40,792
that you left a light burning

1191
01:54:43,169 --> 01:54:45,296
or a door open.

1192
01:54:51,052 --> 01:54:53,137
Go back to bed.

1193
01:54:53,513 --> 01:54:55,640
I won't be long.

1194
01:55:03,689 --> 01:55:05,733
Be back in one xat,

1195
01:55:06,234 --> 01:55:08,319
John Carter of Earth.

1196
01:55:24,210 --> 01:55:26,212
Come.

1197
01:55:56,701 --> 01:55:58,703
John Carter of Earth.

1198
01:56:12,383 --> 01:56:13,634
Yup.

1199
01:56:15,428 --> 01:56:19,557
John Carter of Mars
sounds much better.

1200
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:28,566
Sire, I must express the deepest
of gratitude for saving Helium.

1201
01:56:28,649 --> 01:56:30,610
Please. The honor is mine.

1202
01:56:30,735 --> 01:56:32,945
Fair enough, Earthman.
Now it's your move.

1203
01:56:33,154 --> 01:56:35,907
Ock ohem ocktei wies Jasoom.

1204
01:56:55,426 --> 01:56:57,512
No, no.

1205
01:57:00,014 --> 01:57:01,849
No.

1206
01:57:02,183 --> 01:57:03,476
Powell?

1207
01:57:12,777 --> 01:57:13,861
No!

1208
01:57:26,123 --> 01:57:30,962
Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.

1209

Ock ohem ocktei wies Barsoom.

1210
01:57:42,515 --> 01:57:45,309
Bars... Barsoom.

1211
01:57:50,648 --> 01:57:54,777
<i>50 million miles apart
and no way to bridge the gap.</i>

1212
01:57:54,860 --> 01:57:58,322
<i>No way to return my body
and my soul to their true home.</i>

1213
01:57:59,240 --> 01:58:02,076
<i>Like a fool,
I had thrown away my medallion.</i>

1214
01:58:04,829 --> 01:58:06,872
<i>Then I recalled Matai Shang.</i>

1215
01:58:06,998 --> 01:58:09,500
<i>His knowledge of Earth, of my history.</i>

1216
01:58:09,667 --> 01:58:11,919
<i>It meant Therns
were a presence on this world.</i>

1217
01:58:12,169 --> 01:58:14,005
<i>The cave in Arizona was proof.</i>

1218
01:58:15,047 --> 01:58:17,800
<i>There might be other such proofs,
other Thern way stations</i>

1219
01:58:17,883 --> 01:58:19,719
<i>hidden all around the world.</i>

1220
01:58:19,844 --> 01:58:23,097
<i>I knew now what the cave
of gold must be used for.</i>

1221
01:58:23,347 --> 01:58:26,183
<i>So for ten bitter years, I searched.</i>

1222
01:58:26,350 --> 01:58:28,019
<i>On the trail of rumor and legend</i>

1223
01:58:28,102 --> 01:58:31,105
<i>I ferreted out every possible
evidence of the Therns,</i>

1224
01:58:31,188 --> 01:58:33,065
<i>but I found no medallion.</i>

1225
01:58:35,234 --> 01:58:38,237
<i>And then it came to me.</i>

1226
01:58:43,075 --> 01:58:45,786
I've got it!

1227
01:58:46,787 --> 01:58:48,497
I've found it!

1228
01:58:56,839 --> 01:58:59,008
<i>And once it came,
there were many plans</i>

1229
01:58:59,091 --> 01:59:00,968
<i>I had to make in secret.</i>

1230
01:59:01,052 --> 01:59:03,179
<i>I could trust no one else.</i>

1231
01:59:03,554 --> 01:59:07,892
<i>I had long suspected that the Therns
were following my movements.</i>

1232
01:59:14,565 --> 01:59:16,567
Sir.

1233
01:59:16,692 --> 01:59:18,903
I feel remarkably unwell, Thompson.

1234
01:59:19,904 --> 01:59:23,074
- Please send for the doctor.
- Yes, sir.

1235
01:59:23,240 --> 01:59:25,242
And, Thompson...

1236
01:59:26,243 --> 01:59:28,204
My attorney as well.

1237
01:59:29,955 --> 01:59:31,582
Of course, sir.

1238
01:59:37,588 --> 01:59:40,591
<i>Now you will understand
the cause of my sudden death.</i>

1239
01:59:46,430 --> 01:59:49,266
<i>The reason
for my bizarre funeral instructions.</i>

1240
01:59:52,812 --> 01:59:56,482
<i>Why the door can only be opened
from the inside.</i>

1241
01:59:58,234 --> 02:00:03,239
<i>For if my body dies on Earth,
then my copy dies on Mars.</i>

1242
02:00:05,449 --> 02:00:06,701
<i>You are the key.</i>

1243
02:00:06,784 --> 02:00:10,037
<i>This is the task I entrust to you
along with all my fortune.</i>

1244
02:00:10,121 --> 02:00:13,374
<i>Protect my body.
The Therns will attempt to destroy it.</i>

1245
02:00:13,457 --> 02:00:15,584
<i>In the time it has taken you
to read these pages,</i>

1246
02:00:15,668 --> 02:00:17,753
<i>they may have already done so.</i>

1247
02:00:25,928 --> 02:00:27,930
I am the key. I am the key.

1248
02:00:28,013 --> 02:00:30,141
I, Edgar.

1249
02:00:31,976 --> 02:00:33,978
Ed... Ed...

1250
02:00:34,103 --> 02:00:36,105
E...D...

1251
02:00:36,188 --> 02:00:37,523
Ed!

1252
02:00:37,606 --> 02:00:39,734
It should work!

1253
02:00:49,994 --> 02:00:51,787
Dear Ned.

1254
02:00:53,831 --> 02:00:55,833
You sneaky devil!

1255
02:00:55,958 --> 02:00:59,462
You never called me Edgar!
You... You called me Ned!

1256
02:01:21,066 --> 02:01:22,359
Hello, Ned.

1257
02:01:27,072 --> 02:01:30,075
Toxin. Derived from the puffer fish.

1258
02:01:30,159 --> 02:01:32,036
Simulates death.

1259
02:01:38,042 --> 02:01:40,002
You never found the medallion.

1260
02:01:40,085 --> 02:01:41,378
No.

1261
02:01:42,713 --> 02:01:45,800
That's why I'm so grateful
to you for bringing me one.

1262
02:01:47,384 --> 02:01:50,888
I... I was just bait?

1263
02:01:51,055 --> 02:01:54,391
No. You're far more than that.

1264
02:01:54,725 --> 02:01:56,852
I really do need a protector.

1265
02:01:58,896 --> 02:02:01,065
That is, if you're willing.

1266
02:02:09,782 --> 02:02:11,200
Goodbye, Ned.

1267
02:02:15,746 --> 02:02:17,873
Oh, and, Ned...

1268
02:02:18,916 --> 02:02:20,501
Take up a cause.

1269
02:02:20,584 --> 02:02:22,545
Fall in love.

1270
02:02:22,628 --> 02:02:24,255
Write a book.

1271
02:02:26,257 --> 02:02:28,300
It's time I went home.
