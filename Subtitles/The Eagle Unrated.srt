2
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,954 
IN 120 AD

3
00:00:45,058 --> 00:00:46,956 
THE NINTH LEGION OF THE ROMAN ARMY

4
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:52,003 
MARCHED INTO THE UNCONQUERED
TERRITORY OF NORTHERN BRITAIN

5
00:00:52,326 --> 00:00:55,006 
THEY WERE NEVER SEEN AGAIN

6
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:02,118 
ALL 5,000 MEN VANISHED
TOGETHER WITH THEIR TREASURED STANDARD.

7
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:23,203 
THE EAGLE

8
00:01:24,715 --> 00:01:27,531 
SHAMED BY THIS GREAT LOSS

9
00:01:27,572 --> 00:01:28,674 
THE EMPEROR HADRIAN

10
00:01:28,709 --> 00:01:30,690 
ORDERED THE CONSTURCTION OF GIANT WALL

11
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:34,653 
TO CUT THE NORTH OF BRITAIN FOREVER

12
00:01:35,498 --> 00:01:40,409 
HADIRAN'S WALL MARKED
THE END OF THE KNOWN WORLD

13
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:30,868 
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

14
00:03:30,903 --> 00:03:33,218 
Fourth cohort of Gauls,
second legion.

15
00:03:33,253 --> 00:03:34,632 
Come to relieve the command.

16
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:38,411 
Lutorius Drusillus Salinator,
acting senior officer.

17
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:42,290 
- Where's the garrison commander?
- He left this morning, sir.

18
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:45,523 
Couldn't wait to get away.

19
00:03:57,567 --> 00:04:02,155 
The duty-roster,
and the keys to the pay-chest.

20
00:04:03,334 --> 00:04:05,419 
- No paymaster?
- We're too small a garrison.

21
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:07,943 
Unfortunately,
that job falls to you.

22
00:04:09,288 --> 00:04:11,078 
As you probably noticed,

23
00:04:11,113 --> 00:04:13,376 
we've had a little trouble
with the latrines,

24
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:15,200 
but we have someone
working on it.

25
00:04:15,235 --> 00:04:17,380 
- Unsuccessfully.
- So far.

26
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:22,552 
- This you're first command, sir?
- It is.

27
00:04:23,783 --> 00:04:25,263 
What made you choose Britain?

28
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:29,487 
You have family connections,
I believe.

29
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,438 
No.

30
00:04:33,157 --> 00:04:36,400 
I've noticed the fort,
it's in a poor state of repair.

31
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,716 
We'll need to do something
about that.

32
00:04:42,188 --> 00:04:43,961 
Yes, sir. Sure.

33
00:04:53,106 --> 00:04:54,931 
Move, move, move.

34
00:04:56,589 --> 00:05:01,563 
Get in line, soldier!
Now! Fall in!

35
00:05:12,418 --> 00:05:16,256 
Our new commander,
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

36
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:40,985 
Where's our
newly minted commander?

37
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,504 
Probably unpacking
his rule book.

38
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:04,287 
You mark my words.
Marcus Aquila is tainted.

39
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,767 
Well, you know
who is father was.

40
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,644 
The man who lost
the Eagle of the Ninth.

41
00:06:07,679 --> 00:06:09,914 
Not to mention, 5000 men.

42
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,857 
That was a little absent minded.

43
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:20,377 
I heard,
he asked to be sent here.

44
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:22,667 
- To this shit hole?
- Yeah.

45
00:06:22,702 --> 00:06:25,059 
I'm telling you. I've marched
with the Eagles 23 years.

46
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:27,228 
I know a bad omen,
when I see one.

47
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:29,720 
The boy's a bad omen.

48
00:06:30,752 --> 00:06:32,150 
Mithras, lord of light.

49
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:37,082 
Please, help me.
Father of our fathers.

50
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,962 
Help me lead my men well.

51
00:06:45,518 --> 00:06:47,938 
Do not let me
dishonour my legion.

52
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:57,229 
Please, help me regain
my family's honour.

53
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:29,639 
Dig in deep, boys.

54
00:07:31,547 --> 00:07:34,352 
Your lives depend
on these defences.

55
00:07:42,496 --> 00:07:44,957 
You must be answerable
to your instructions!

56
00:08:02,507 --> 00:08:05,150 
It's been told,
the grain delivery hasn't arrived.

57
00:08:05,185 --> 00:08:07,759 
I want you to send out a patrol
to investigate.

58
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:11,277 
I wouldn't worry, sir. One day late,
is nothing here.

59
00:08:11,312 --> 00:08:14,708 
Well, it is to me.
Send out the patrol.

60
00:08:14,743 --> 00:08:16,905 
Believe me sir,
too dangerous.

61
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:19,380 
We've had reports of a Druid
roaming the villages.

62
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,091 
Right now,
I would not send out a patrol.

63
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,439 
The men,
they need to eat too.

64
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:31,726 
Patrol!
Forward! March!

65
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,968 
Left, right, march.

66
00:09:26,827 --> 00:09:29,215 
- Wake Lutorius.
- Yes, sir.

67
00:09:41,458 --> 00:09:44,200 
- Did you hear that?
- Sir?

68
00:09:52,449 --> 00:09:55,024 
I hope the patrol's all right.

69
00:10:01,448 --> 00:10:03,148 
It seems I may have got you up
for nothing.

70
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:05,459 
What did you hear?

71
00:10:05,494 --> 00:10:07,298 
It's a cattle, most likely.

72
00:10:09,894 --> 00:10:14,524 
There. That.
Did you hear it?

73
00:10:18,122 --> 00:10:19,530 
Damn the dark.

74
00:10:22,001 --> 00:10:23,749 
Should I call the men to arms?

75
00:10:23,784 --> 00:10:26,589 
If it's only cattle,
they won't thank you.

76
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:31,772 
Better angry than dead.

77
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,416 
Call them out.

78
00:10:33,451 --> 00:10:38,581 
- But in silence.
- Yes, sir.

79
00:10:40,719 --> 00:10:42,304 
Soldier, wake up!

80
00:10:52,617 --> 00:10:54,401 
Bloody helmets!

81
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,970 
Come on, come on!
Move, move, move!

82
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:24,570 
Bring me a torch!

83
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:30,608 
Hold! Steady!

84
00:12:42,152 --> 00:12:43,862 
Hold your lines!

85
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,790 
- Sir.
- Well done, sir.

86
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:13,959 
- Well done.
- Sir.

87
00:14:29,507 --> 00:14:31,707 
The light of the sun be with you,
brother.

88
00:14:35,711 --> 00:14:38,558 
Many more of us
would be lyng there, sir.

89
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:46,515 
Is there any sign of the patrol?

90
00:14:59,998 --> 00:15:01,802 
Sir!

91
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:01,940 
Today, the god of victory, we will take it to us.

92
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,581 
On your knees, seed of evil

93
00:16:22,378 --> 00:16:24,881 
You have stolen our lands

94
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,905 
and killed our sons

95
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:32,493 
You have defiled our daughters

96
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:35,934 
I curse you!

97
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:41,983 
You wicked

98
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,151 
Die!

99
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,671 
I'm not leaving them to die.

100
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:24,007 
Muster fifty of the reserves
and hold them at the gate.

101
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:27,052 
Sir...
Let me lead them.

102
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,294 
It was my decision
to send out the patrol.

103
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,682 
It's my responsibility
to bring them back.

104
00:17:43,361 --> 00:17:45,947 
move away! move out!

105
00:17:46,677 --> 00:17:50,327 
Prepare to battle!

106
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:09,963 
Mithras, lord of light,
father of our fathers,

107
00:18:10,171 --> 00:18:12,736 
let me not bring misfortune
to my Legion.

108
00:18:13,988 --> 00:18:15,402 
Mithras, lord of light,
father of our fathers,

109
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:18,816 
accept whatever sacrifice
that I may not bring misfortune to my Legion.

110
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,770 
On my command!

111
00:18:26,126 --> 00:18:27,481 
We form Testudo!

112
00:18:32,007 --> 00:18:34,204 
Ready!

113
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,914 
Open the gate!

114
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:39,338 
Legion!
Dopuble time, March!

115
00:19:02,644 --> 00:19:04,865 
Testudo!

116
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,087 
Form!

117
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:30,309 
- Move forward!
- Move forward!

118
00:19:30,344 --> 00:19:32,259 
Move forward!

119
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:50,977 
Locking Testudo!
Move!

120
00:19:51,012 --> 00:19:53,136 
Hold the circle!

121
00:19:58,934 --> 00:20:00,759 
Hold the circle!

122
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:04,075 
- Hold the circle!
- Hold the circle!

123
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:10,957 
Here!
Cut that's free!

124
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:19,373 
Hold the circle!

125
00:20:20,384 --> 00:20:23,492 
Hold the circle!
Hold!

126
00:20:31,052 --> 00:20:32,877 
Hold the circle!

127
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:00,928 
Fall back!

128
00:21:00,963 --> 00:21:02,544 
Run!

129
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:10,573 
Run!

130
00:21:49,334 --> 00:21:51,159 
Father, where are you?

131
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:27,792 
Father.

132
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:37,187 
Rest now.
Lie still, still.

133
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:41,824 
where am I?

134
00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:45,665 
You still in Britain.
Calleva.

135
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,923 
Calleva?

136
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,660 
Your fort surgeon
had you transferred here.

137
00:22:50,695 --> 00:22:54,567 
Two hundred leagues
in a mule cart.

138
00:22:54,602 --> 00:22:57,574 
A few are wounded,
so I wonder you didn't die.

139
00:22:58,804 --> 00:23:03,059 
I'm your uncle,
in your father's side. Aquila.

140
00:23:05,614 --> 00:23:08,009 
These are not the best circumstances,
under which to meet,

141
00:23:08,044 --> 00:23:12,517 
but... assuming you gonna live
so you'll have a plenty of time to make your acquaintance.

142
00:23:14,571 --> 00:23:18,690 
Don't. Please, lie still.
The patient must rest.

143
00:23:20,901 --> 00:23:23,571 
I hope the medicine, he's gonna
give you does you some good.

144
00:23:23,675 --> 00:23:26,762 
It smells repellent,
like one of his farts.

145
00:23:27,387 --> 00:23:28,493 
My men?

146
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,319 
What happened to my men?

147
00:23:32,153 --> 00:23:33,394 
Your men were saved.

148
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:35,531 
Thanks to your effort.

149
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:45,563 
Rest now.

150
00:24:05,439 --> 00:24:06,554 
Marcus.

151
00:24:08,004 --> 00:24:09,130 
Marcus.

152
00:24:10,225 --> 00:24:12,050 
You have a visitor.

153
00:24:12,728 --> 00:24:15,262 
- Lutorius.
- Sir.

154
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:20,799 
The men have been asking
after you.

155
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,286 
And how are they?

156
00:24:22,321 --> 00:24:25,189 
Anxious to know
how their Commander fares.

157
00:24:29,663 --> 00:24:31,362 
You have some news
for my nephew?

158
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:33,309 
Yes, sorry.

159
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:36,030 
We have received
word from Rome.

160
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:37,984 
For holding the fort
under extreme duress,

161
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:39,690 
the Fourth Cohort of Gauls,

162
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:42,673 
has been awarded
the gilded laurel.

163
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:46,441 
From today, their standard
will carry its first wreath.

164
00:24:49,809 --> 00:24:52,041 
Tell the men
I could not be more proud.

165
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:53,866 
And that's not all, sir.

166
00:24:55,242 --> 00:25:01,040 
They've awarded you,
a military armilla for conspicuous gallantry.

167
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:06,296 
And an honourable discharge,

168
00:25:07,495 --> 00:25:09,601 
because of your wounds.

169
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:20,206 
The citation reads
"honour and faithfulness".

170
00:25:23,147 --> 00:25:25,531 
Honour and faithfulness.

171
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:29,435 
May I be the first to offer
my congratulations.

172
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:39,060 
It was good of you
to come so far.

173
00:25:43,846 --> 00:25:45,286 
Sir.

174
00:25:48,497 --> 00:25:50,854 
Thank you, Lutorius.

175
00:26:06,225 --> 00:26:10,674 
Stephanos. Leave him.

176
00:26:10,709 --> 00:26:13,305 
There's no medicine for that.

177
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:22,244 
Ease him down.

178
00:27:23,766 --> 00:27:25,383 
careful.

179
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,604 
Gently.

180
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:34,559 
Fun.

181
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,528 
What was my father like?

182
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:48,063 
Your father?

183
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,294 
Your father was
the perfect Roman,

184
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:56,948 
with everything that that implies.

185
00:27:57,605 --> 00:28:00,817 
The man who lost the Eagle
was the perfect Roman?

186
00:28:01,922 --> 00:28:04,805 
How the Eagle was lost,
no one knows.

187
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:07,689 
But if your father died
defending it,

188
00:28:07,724 --> 00:28:10,094 
he died honourably.

189
00:28:10,129 --> 00:28:12,871 
That's what we tell ourselves.
But what if he didn't?

190
00:28:12,906 --> 00:28:14,004 
What?

191
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:16,041 
What if he was a coward
and ran?

192
00:28:28,982 --> 00:28:32,215 
And now...
a fight to the death!

193
00:28:59,442 --> 00:29:00,825 
It's a slay.

194
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,979 
A gladiator and a slave's
never a fair contest. Never.

195
00:29:09,672 --> 00:29:12,998 
Come on. Come on.

196
00:29:15,845 --> 00:29:19,453 
- Come on!
- Come on!

197
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:31,070 
There's bravery.
He's gonna give himself his death.

198
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,478 
Come on, fight!

199
00:29:48,005 --> 00:29:50,820 
Look at that,
look at that!

200
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,536 
Fight!

201
00:30:00,935 --> 00:30:02,412 
Fight!

202
00:30:02,447 --> 00:30:04,992 
- Get up, son!
- Fight him! - Fight!

203
00:30:05,027 --> 00:30:07,251 
- Fight steady!
- Get up!

204
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:09,455 
- Get up and fight!
- Get up!...

205
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:13,532 
Get up!
Fight!

206
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,755 
- Come on!
- Fight!

207
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:35,160 
Come on! Get up!

208
00:30:40,843 --> 00:30:55,150 
Kill! Kill! Kill!

209
00:30:55,185 --> 00:30:56,558 
Kill him!

210
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:06,402 
Life! Life!

211
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,192 
Life!
Come on, what is this?

212
00:31:10,227 --> 00:31:12,384 
Come on,
get your thumbs up!

213
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:15,526 
Come on, you fools! Life!
All of you, life!

214
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:17,910 
- Kill, kill!
- Better be, it's life!

215
00:31:17,945 --> 00:31:20,260 
Get your thumbs up!
Get your thumbs up!

216
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,304 
- Life!
- Come on you fools!

217
00:31:22,339 --> 00:31:23,430 
Get your thumbs up!

218
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,516 
Life!

219
00:31:26,225 --> 00:31:27,351 
Life!

220
00:31:36,163 --> 00:31:38,134 
- Life!
- Life!

221
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:40,355 
Come on!

222
00:31:50,021 --> 00:31:52,868 
No doubt
that was not expecting.

223
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:57,842 
Why did you save him?

224
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:19,908 
Stephanos!

225
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:23,537 
Stephanos!

226
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,296 
I've decided Stephanos
is too old to serve two masters.

227
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:35,393 
I've bought you
your own body slave.

228
00:32:35,428 --> 00:32:37,301 
I don't need my own slave.

229
00:32:37,336 --> 00:32:39,477 
Marcus.

230
00:32:39,512 --> 00:32:42,541 
I should have been consulted.

231
00:32:42,576 --> 00:32:45,571 
Yeah, well...
you weren't.

232
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:47,604 
Slave!

233
00:32:57,292 --> 00:32:59,669 
His name's Esca.

234
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:07,292 
- I have no use for you.
- I had no wish to be bought.

235
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:08,929 
You should've run.

236
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:11,745 
My uncle wouldn't stop you.

237
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,570 
You saved my life.

238
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,978 
I have a debt of honour
to you.

239
00:33:16,013 --> 00:33:17,803 
Against your wish.

240
00:33:19,253 --> 00:33:22,068 
No man should have to beg
for his life.

241
00:33:22,103 --> 00:33:24,884 
You didn't. I did,
on your behalf, and...

242
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:26,000 
I meant nothing by.

243
00:33:31,193 --> 00:33:33,591 
I'm the son of the Brigantes,

244
00:33:33,626 --> 00:33:35,990 
who never broke his word.

245
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,566 
My father's dagger
is my bond.

246
00:33:42,424 --> 00:33:45,208 
I hate everything
you stand for.

247
00:33:45,243 --> 00:33:47,033 
Everything you are.

248
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:50,140 
But you saved me.

249
00:33:52,111 --> 00:33:54,218 
And for that
I must serve you.

250
00:34:00,756 --> 00:34:02,518 
Who searched this wound?

251
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:04,245 
The surgeon at the fort.

252
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,804 
Was he drunk?
Never seen such a mess.

253
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:09,293 
You must have been
in constant pain.

254
00:34:09,328 --> 00:34:13,311 
Sent him two hundred leagues
in a mule cart, nearly killed him.

255
00:34:13,346 --> 00:34:15,237 
I'm going to have
to re-open it.

256
00:34:15,272 --> 00:34:17,093 
There's still metal in there.

257
00:34:17,128 --> 00:34:20,444 
Well...
I guess, it's gonna be time.

258
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:22,098 
You're gonna do it, right?

259
00:34:22,133 --> 00:34:25,011 
- Yeah.
- It'll be over before you know it.

260
00:34:25,046 --> 00:34:27,472 
I've the best knives
in the business.

261
00:34:35,762 --> 00:34:37,170 
Some wine.

262
00:34:51,237 --> 00:34:53,636 
- Ready?
- Ready.

263
00:34:59,287 --> 00:35:01,401 
You can go.

264
00:35:01,436 --> 00:35:04,877 
No. I'm gonna need the slave
to hold you down.

265
00:35:05,857 --> 00:35:09,799 
- Can't my uncle do it?
- Me? No...

266
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:13,706 
I've grown to hate
the sight of blood,

267
00:35:13,741 --> 00:35:17,192 
especially, the blood of someone
I'm quite fond of.

268
00:35:18,537 --> 00:35:19,935 
Be strong.

269
00:35:24,043 --> 00:35:26,150 
Quickly now.
Hold him down.

270
00:35:28,694 --> 00:35:30,801 
Put your weight on him, slave!

271
00:35:31,593 --> 00:35:32,719 
Harder!

272
00:35:34,502 --> 00:35:35,938 
Take a deep breath.

273
00:35:35,973 --> 00:35:38,548 
When I say "now",
let it out.

274
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:40,571 
Now!

275
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,324 
Did I shame myself?

276
00:36:50,699 --> 00:36:52,096 
Thank you.

277
00:37:00,459 --> 00:37:01,867 
There he is.

278
00:37:05,298 --> 00:37:07,780 
Spear! Now!

279
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,929 
Cut him off!
Turn around!

280
00:37:46,342 --> 00:37:49,835 
As I remember it,
they seem to be fond of you.

281
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,103 
Marcus.
May I present my nephew,

282
00:37:56,138 --> 00:37:58,685 
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

283
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,428 
Claudius Marcellus
is my old friend,

284
00:38:01,463 --> 00:38:04,330 
and the esteemed Legate
of the Sixth Legion.

285
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:07,094 
Your uncle is an old
sparring partner.

286
00:38:07,129 --> 00:38:09,765 
Tribune Servius Placidus,
and...

287
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,401 
indispensable member
of my staff.

288
00:38:12,436 --> 00:38:13,493 
pleasure.

289
00:38:13,528 --> 00:38:15,884 
Ah... Supper's ready.

290
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,241 
Boiled eggs and fish.

291
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,974 
Don't all rush at once.

292
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:27,835 
If it was my choice,
I'd be a soldier all my life.

293
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:31,245 
However, my father will insist
I go into politics.

294
00:38:32,027 --> 00:38:34,863 
Have we met before?
Your name sounds familiar.

295
00:38:34,898 --> 00:38:36,236 
Oh, I doubt it.

296
00:38:36,271 --> 00:38:38,544 
The Tribune's Club,
in Rome?

297
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,236 
No, I was only
a cohort centurion.

298
00:38:42,271 --> 00:38:44,676 
Ah. Right.
I remember now.

299
00:38:44,711 --> 00:38:45,850 
Flavius Aquila...

300
00:38:45,885 --> 00:38:48,336 
Your father marched
with the Eagles, too, did he not?

301
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,506 
He commanded
the First Cohort of the Ninth.

302
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,204 
Of course. The Ninth.

303
00:38:55,239 --> 00:38:57,710 
Every Roman
remembers the Ninth.

304
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,878 
Talking of the Ninth,

305
00:39:01,913 --> 00:39:03,707 
there's been a rumour recently
along the Wall.

306
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:06,497 
Rumours, rumours.

307
00:39:06,532 --> 00:39:09,619 
Britain's full of nothing
but rumours.

308
00:39:09,654 --> 00:39:12,963 
They say
the Eagle's been seen,

309
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:16,684 
receiving divine honours in some
tribal temple in the far north.

310
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:20,370 
An Eagle in the hands of the
Painted People, a potent weapon.

311
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:23,123 
One has to wonder
how any Roman could let it go.

312
00:39:24,051 --> 00:39:26,509 
If this were to be true,

313
00:39:26,544 --> 00:39:31,274 
surly, we should act.
What would Rome say?

314
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:35,585 
Eagle lost, honour lost.
Honour lost, all lost.

315
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,451 
Rome would love to get
the Eagle back,

316
00:39:37,486 --> 00:39:39,731 
but politics being politics,

317
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:43,760 
no Senator's going to risk
thousands of lives, on a tainted Legion.

318
00:39:44,626 --> 00:39:47,145 
My hands are tied.

319
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,933 
Not if you sent one man.

320
00:39:49,968 --> 00:39:53,058 
North of the wall?

321
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:55,945 
No Roman could survive
up there.

322
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,762 
- Has anyone ever tried?
- No...

323
00:39:58,797 --> 00:40:02,363 
but that's the point, militarily.
To try, would be to fail.

324
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:03,955 
How do you know?

325
00:40:03,990 --> 00:40:06,367 
One man can hide
where an army can't.

326
00:40:06,402 --> 00:40:08,778 
No one would even know
he was there.

327
00:40:08,813 --> 00:40:11,119 
- It's too risky.
- Quite right.

328
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:13,417 
The loss of the Ninth
was humiliating enough,

329
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,659 
without adding
another pointless death.

330
00:40:19,184 --> 00:40:21,300 
Marcus.

331
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:30,706 
Marcus.

332
00:40:32,166 --> 00:40:35,555 
You can't let the likes of him
do this to you.

333
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:40,550 
He has no notion
how you and I, lived our lives.

334
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:44,815 
Ever since I can remember,

335
00:40:47,652 --> 00:40:51,009 
all I've ever worked to be
was a soldier. like my father.

336
00:40:51,044 --> 00:40:52,125 
I know.

337
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:56,547 
I can still see him now,
riding away for the last time.

338
00:40:56,582 --> 00:40:59,863 
I can still feel
how proud I was.

339
00:41:02,741 --> 00:41:04,618 
My father...

340
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:08,017 
Centurion of the First Cohort
of the Ninth Legion!

341
00:41:08,122 --> 00:41:13,252 
Can you imagine anything
more magnificent, than to be a soldier?

342
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:16,266 
And to serve Rome,
with courage and faithfulness.

343
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:21,136 
- But you did, son.
- For what? For what?!

344
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:26,475 
- An honourable discharge?
- That's fate.

345
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,581 
That's in the hands of the Gods.

346
00:41:30,531 --> 00:41:33,426 
When I made Centurion,

347
00:41:33,461 --> 00:41:36,855 
they asked me,
where I wanted to be posted.

348
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:40,250 
I knew the answer
before they'd even asked.

349
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:41,647 
Britain.

350
00:41:42,408 --> 00:41:43,865 
This is where my father
lost the Eagle.

351
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,856 
This is where I was going
to win so much glory,

352
00:41:45,891 --> 00:41:49,687 
that no Roman would ever dare
bring up his name again.

353
00:41:49,722 --> 00:41:50,872 
And what all I do now?

354
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:56,444 
What all I do? I sit, and I listen to
some silk-arsed politician's son, pisses on our family's name!

355
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:03,097 
I will not sit in some villa,
for the rest of my days,

356
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:04,933 
rotting and remembering.

357
00:42:07,143 --> 00:42:10,063 
If I can't win back
my family's honour,

358
00:42:10,098 --> 00:42:13,292 
by being a soldier,

359
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:16,424 
then I'll do it by finding
the lost Eagle.

360
00:42:16,459 --> 00:42:18,297 
You can't.

361
00:42:18,332 --> 00:42:21,899 
No Roman can survive
north of the wall alone.

362
00:42:21,934 --> 00:42:23,230 
You can't.

363
00:42:23,265 --> 00:42:25,441 
Then I'll take Esca.

364
00:42:25,476 --> 00:42:27,613 
I can use his knowledge,
he speaks their language.

365
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:29,939 
- Esca?
- Why not?

366
00:42:31,284 --> 00:42:33,804 
Because he's a Britain.

367
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:37,228 
He may not be
from north of the wall,

368
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,664 
but he's a Britain.

369
00:42:39,699 --> 00:42:42,880 
And he will slit your throat
the minute you're alone.

370
00:42:42,915 --> 00:42:44,715 
- He wouldn't do that.
- How do you know?

371
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,751 
- He gave me his word.
- His word?

372
00:42:48,786 --> 00:42:50,158 
He's a slave.

373
00:42:51,566 --> 00:42:55,748 
He says what he says,
and he does what he does, because he has to.

374
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:01,076 
Once you be on their territories.

375
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,038 
If I'm wrong...

376
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:04,966 
then I'll die.

377
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:09,283 
And that's how it should be.

378
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:28,754 
Where are you heading?

379
00:44:28,789 --> 00:44:30,464 
North.

380
00:44:35,397 --> 00:44:38,660 
Didn't they tell you,
this is the end of the world?

381
00:44:38,695 --> 00:44:40,756 
Just open the gates, soldier.

382
00:44:48,077 --> 00:44:50,173 
See you in the afterlife, Roman.

383
00:45:52,865 --> 00:45:54,888 
Who did this?

384
00:45:56,244 --> 00:45:59,070 
Rogue warriors.

385
00:46:23,627 --> 00:46:26,825 
You know, sometimes, I...

386
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:31,375 
I dream that I'll
find my father alive up here.

387
00:46:31,410 --> 00:46:34,180 
And that he survived
in some hidden place?

388
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:38,690 
Is that why you're here?

389
00:46:38,725 --> 00:46:41,125 
To find your father?

390
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:42,304 
No.

391
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:45,463 
We're here to find the Eagle.

392
00:46:46,548 --> 00:46:49,353 
How can a piece of metal
mean so much to you?

393
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:54,630 
The Eagle is not
a piece of metal.

394
00:46:54,665 --> 00:46:56,454 
The Eagle is Rome.

395
00:46:58,029 --> 00:46:59,885 
It's a symbol of our honour.

396
00:47:00,949 --> 00:47:03,545 
Every victory,
every achievement.

397
00:47:05,892 --> 00:47:09,103 
Wherever the Eagle is,
we can say that...

398
00:47:09,138 --> 00:47:10,532 
Rome did that.

399
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:22,107 
You wouldn't understand.
How could you?

400
00:47:28,823 --> 00:47:31,012 
My father was Cunoval,

401
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:35,100 
bearer of the Blue War Shield's
the Brigantes.

402
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:37,446 
Lord of five hundred spears.

403
00:47:40,439 --> 00:47:43,505 
Seven years ago,
you took our lands.

404
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:45,330 
And we rose against you.

405
00:47:48,125 --> 00:47:50,231 
My father
and two brothers died.

406
00:47:53,318 --> 00:47:55,143 
My mother also.

407
00:47:56,613 --> 00:48:00,117 
My father killed her before
the Legionaries broke through.

408
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,894 
He knew
what they would do to her.

409
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:11,462 
She knelt in front of him
and he slit her throat.

410
00:48:15,779 --> 00:48:17,875 
Rome also did that.

411
00:48:47,011 --> 00:48:48,836 
The Highlands.

412
00:48:50,202 --> 00:48:53,090 
- Which way?
- It's up to you.

413
00:48:55,249 --> 00:48:58,753 
Five thousand men could
disappear in a single glen.

414
00:49:00,776 --> 00:49:02,882 
There are thousands of glens.

415
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:07,293 
You could search for months
and still find nothing.

416
00:49:24,593 --> 00:49:25,719 
North.

417
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:32,685 
Whoever we meet,
let me do the talking.

418
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,656 
If they find out
you're a Roman,

419
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:36,408 
they'll kill you. And me.

420
00:50:48,767 --> 00:50:50,796 
Don't look.

421
00:50:50,831 --> 00:50:53,616 
There's three Rogue warriors
behind you, across the river.

422
00:50:56,129 --> 00:50:57,954 
How many behind me?

423
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,120 
I don't see anyone.

424
00:51:08,788 --> 00:51:11,218 
They're there.

425
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:16,651 
Are you ready?

426
00:52:44,454 --> 00:52:46,873 
Next time,
don't hesitate.

427
00:53:26,301 --> 00:53:27,698 
Stay back.

428
00:53:50,358 --> 00:53:53,090 
He remembers seeing
the Legion march north.

429
00:53:53,125 --> 00:53:54,863 
but they never came back
this way.

430
00:53:55,603 --> 00:53:57,678 
He must know
more than that.

431
00:53:57,713 --> 00:53:58,769 
He says not.

432
00:53:58,804 --> 00:54:02,162 
- Ask him again.
- No.

433
00:54:44,499 --> 00:54:46,934 
What're you doing?

434
00:54:46,969 --> 00:54:49,334 
Enough!
Enough!

435
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,731 
No more games,
no more lies!

436
00:54:51,766 --> 00:54:54,093 
Ask him
where the legion went.

437
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,117 
Ask him!

438
00:56:04,575 --> 00:56:05,972 
Kill him!

439
00:56:08,173 --> 00:56:09,497 
Kill him.

440
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:10,926 
Do it, now!

441
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:12,017 
Chin-strap scar.

442
00:56:12,052 --> 00:56:14,148 
Only a Roman helmet
does that.

443
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:19,278 
He's a Legionary.

444
00:56:26,411 --> 00:56:28,914 
What do you want from me?

445
00:56:32,709 --> 00:56:34,534 
What's your name?

446
00:56:40,916 --> 00:56:42,741 
What's your name?

447
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:48,706 
I'm called Guern.

448
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,164 
My name...

449
00:56:52,199 --> 00:56:55,157 
is Lucius Caius Metellus.

450
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:57,934 
First Cohort
of the Ninth Legion.

451
00:57:13,232 --> 00:57:15,485 
How did you survived
up here for so long?

452
00:57:16,715 --> 00:57:19,548 
My tribe is called
the Selgovae.

453
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:22,117 
They took me in,
made me one of their own.

454
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:27,268 
I have a woman,
two sons.

455
00:57:27,303 --> 00:57:29,562 
My life is here now.

456
00:57:33,994 --> 00:57:35,819 
I don't trust him.

457
00:57:36,966 --> 00:57:39,761 
- He's a deserter.
- We don't know that.

458
00:57:40,428 --> 00:57:42,253 
He's still a Roman.

459
00:57:43,275 --> 00:57:45,746 
He was a Roman
when he ran.

460
00:57:57,665 --> 00:58:03,057 
I don't know what your
father's orders were, but...

461
00:58:04,777 --> 00:58:06,904 
All I know...

462
00:58:09,105 --> 00:58:11,201 
is that we had it coming.

463
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,757 
Why did they have
to come north?

464
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:18,740 
There's nothing here
worth taking.

465
00:58:21,504 --> 00:58:24,309 
Couldn't they be satisfied
with what they had?

466
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:31,337 
They always have to punish
and push on, looking for more conquests,

467
00:58:31,441 --> 00:58:34,872 
more territories, more wars.

468
00:58:36,207 --> 00:58:38,313 
Just tell me
what happened.

469
00:58:44,330 --> 00:58:49,075 
When the order came
for the Ninth to march north, it was autumn.

470
00:58:49,617 --> 00:58:52,172 
Worst weather
they had in years.

471
00:58:53,569 --> 00:58:58,074 
For weeks we marched,
no sign of them.

472
00:58:59,607 --> 00:59:02,412 
Suddenly, they just appeared
out of the mist.

473
00:59:06,917 --> 00:59:10,608 
We can hear them,
picking the men off at the back, one by one.

474
00:59:13,539 --> 00:59:18,189 
Finally, we just stopped trying to find open ground
and we turned and faced them.

475
00:59:24,863 --> 00:59:27,668 
Those last few days
in the Legion,

476
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:31,266 
I've never been so frightened.

477
00:59:32,642 --> 00:59:35,552 
We fought back to back.

478
00:59:35,587 --> 00:59:37,196 
No sleep,

479
00:59:37,231 --> 00:59:39,202 
pissing where we stood.

480
00:59:42,737 --> 00:59:44,833 
They came as if like animals.

481
00:59:55,678 --> 00:59:57,805 
This is the killing ground.

482
01:00:03,718 --> 01:00:05,824 
All the northern tribes
were here.

483
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,772 
But their worst,

484
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:13,009 
were the painted warriors
of the Seal People.

485
01:00:15,491 --> 01:00:17,416 
They hacked the feet
off the dead.

486
01:00:17,451 --> 01:00:20,871 
so their souls couldn't walk
into the afterlife.

487
01:00:30,267 --> 01:00:33,927 
They used those stones
as Altars, to kill the officers.

488
01:00:39,016 --> 01:00:42,363 
They ripped their hearts off
while they were still alive.

489
01:00:46,044 --> 01:00:48,870 
We could hear them
being sacrificed.

490
01:01:01,384 --> 01:01:03,904 
And my father?

491
01:01:03,939 --> 01:01:05,763 
What happened to him?

492
01:01:07,672 --> 01:01:12,396 
The last time, I saw your father,
he was surrounded by the warriors of the Seal People.

493
01:01:14,158 --> 01:01:15,962 
Did he die fighting?

494
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:21,624 
- Did he die fighting?
- I don't know.

495
01:01:25,013 --> 01:01:30,175 
I ran before the end.
A lot of us did.

496
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:33,272 
- You coward.
- No.

497
01:01:34,597 --> 01:01:36,421 
You weren't here.

498
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,509 
You don't what it was like.

499
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:46,324 
Who has the Eagle?

500
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:49,227 
They say the Seal People
have it.

501
01:01:49,262 --> 01:01:52,188 
How do I find them?

502
01:01:52,223 --> 01:01:53,596 
He knows.

503
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:58,095 
He's Brigantes.

504
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,645 
They fought here.

505
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:15,881 
You always knew
that place existed, didn't you?

506
01:02:16,433 --> 01:02:18,525 
We've wasted weeks
searching for it.

507
01:02:18,560 --> 01:02:20,365 
And all this time
you could have told me.

508
01:02:20,400 --> 01:02:21,894 
Your tribe was there.

509
01:02:21,929 --> 01:02:24,098 
And they butchered
my father's men like dogs.

510
01:02:24,133 --> 01:02:26,340 
Your father came to kill!

511
01:02:27,727 --> 01:02:30,991 
He came to punish us,
cause we were not bowed to the name of Rome.

512
01:02:31,658 --> 01:02:33,957 
Yes, I've heard of this place.

513
01:02:33,992 --> 01:02:36,222 
To me and to all my people,

514
01:02:36,257 --> 01:02:38,436 
- it is the place of heroes.
- How dare you?

515
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:39,527 
You're still my slave!

516
01:02:39,562 --> 01:02:42,357 
- And you'd be dead in a ditch without me!
- I saved your miserable life!

517
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:19,053 
Who are you?

518
01:03:21,086 --> 01:03:23,335 
I am Esca.

519
01:03:23,370 --> 01:03:25,921 
Son of Cunoval.

520
01:03:25,956 --> 01:03:28,761 
Slain Chief of the Brigantes.

521
01:03:33,516 --> 01:03:37,395 
Who is he that you talk to
in the Roman tongue?

522
01:03:42,359 --> 01:03:44,580 
My slave.

523
01:03:50,628 --> 01:03:51,744 
My slave.

524
01:04:02,276 --> 01:04:03,402 
It's true.

525
01:04:06,374 --> 01:04:11,317 
Their god marks them all
with the same scar.

526
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:19,086 
My father would like to see
such a slave.

527
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,036 
You will be my guest.

528
01:04:24,696 --> 01:04:28,972 
You must teach your slave
not to talk to you as he does.

529
01:04:29,007 --> 01:04:30,744 
We will help you.

530
01:04:36,052 --> 01:04:38,252 
No! What's happening?

531
01:04:39,128 --> 01:04:41,767 
No!
Esca?

532
01:04:41,802 --> 01:04:43,734 
Esca?

533
01:04:43,769 --> 01:04:46,970 
Esca? Esca!

534
01:07:06,339 --> 01:07:08,972 
The hunting was good?

535
01:07:09,007 --> 01:07:11,605 
It was good, father.

536
01:07:13,013 --> 01:07:16,537 
You wish me to eat
these people, too?

537
01:07:18,685 --> 01:07:21,047 
I bring a guest, Esca.

538
01:07:21,082 --> 01:07:23,374 
Eldest son to Cunoval,

539
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:27,153 
the slain Chief
of the Brigantes.

540
01:07:27,188 --> 01:07:29,614 
And his slave.

541
01:07:29,649 --> 01:07:31,011 
A Roman.

542
01:07:40,824 --> 01:07:43,792 
Does the slave have a name?

543
01:07:43,827 --> 01:07:49,322 
- Marcus Flavius Aquila.
- Marcus Flavius Aquila.

544
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:53,827 
I have brought many Romans
back to my village,

545
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:56,921 
Marcus Flavius Aquila.

546
01:07:56,956 --> 01:08:01,773 
but never with their head
attached to their body.

547
01:08:03,994 --> 01:08:07,707 
You're welcome Esca,
son of Cunoval.

548
01:08:10,209 --> 01:08:12,208 
Come. Eat with us.

549
01:08:12,243 --> 01:08:14,328 
Esca.
Esca, what's happening?

550
01:08:16,268 --> 01:08:18,719 
You're my slave.

551
01:08:22,243 --> 01:08:24,068 
Show him where to go.

552
01:10:52,905 --> 01:10:55,053 
How do you know
he’s not a spy?

553
01:10:56,889 --> 01:10:59,700 
He swore allegiance to me.

554
01:10:59,735 --> 01:11:03,437 
He would not dare
to disobey me.

555
01:11:03,472 --> 01:11:08,286 
And never to abandon me.

556
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:13,109 
I've seen many Romans,

557
01:11:13,144 --> 01:11:16,086 
he's not savage as them.

558
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:40,800 
You!

559
01:11:42,062 --> 01:11:44,367 
Take your eyes off her, slave!

560
01:11:45,524 --> 01:11:46,845 
What is it?

561
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,986 
He was looking at my sister.

562
01:11:49,841 --> 01:11:52,956 
All Romans are savages.

563
01:11:52,991 --> 01:11:55,744 
I have seen what they do
to their prisoners.

564
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:59,727 
Such people
are not to be trusted.

565
01:12:02,417 --> 01:12:04,420 
Kneel.

566
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:07,673 
Kneel!

567
01:12:13,002 --> 01:12:15,004 
Get on your knees!

568
01:12:15,963 --> 01:12:17,746 
Do it!

569
01:12:24,024 --> 01:12:26,214 
If it pleases you...

570
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:28,425 
kill him.

571
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,813 
No.

572
01:12:44,848 --> 01:12:49,802 
You are my honoured guest,
and he is your property.

573
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:52,774 
As long as you trust him,

574
01:12:52,809 --> 01:12:54,984 
he lives.

575
01:13:03,327 --> 01:13:06,997 
When I get the chance,

576
01:13:07,032 --> 01:13:09,479 
I will kill you.

577
01:13:22,170 --> 01:13:24,683 
Now is the time to strike.

578
01:13:24,718 --> 01:13:27,196 
Bring the great bird south,

579
01:13:28,030 --> 01:13:32,284 
and complete the victory of our
clan brothers fifteen years ago.

580
01:13:32,319 --> 01:13:36,539 
At the ceremony of the New Spears,
we will ask The Horned One.

581
01:13:36,574 --> 01:13:40,700 
If he blesses your request,
we will march south.

582
01:15:38,024 --> 01:15:42,404 
Behold, the great Eagle!

583
01:16:26,055 --> 01:16:28,085 
Marcus.

584
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,311 
Marcus!
Marcus!

585
01:16:32,572 --> 01:16:34,606 
It’s time.

586
01:16:35,690 --> 01:16:37,515 
We have to do this now.

587
01:16:38,933 --> 01:16:41,551 
It’s our only chance.
while they sleep.

588
01:16:44,439 --> 01:16:46,264 
I thought I’d lost you.

589
01:16:48,996 --> 01:16:50,404 
Quickly.

590
01:18:39,094 --> 01:18:42,118 
There’s no time now.
Let’s go.

591
01:18:47,499 --> 01:18:49,053 
We have to go now!

592
01:19:43,486 --> 01:19:45,499 
Where did you get
my father’s ring?

593
01:19:45,534 --> 01:19:50,584 
Just another dead Roman.

594
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:57,480 
The coward knelt before me
and begged for his life.

595
01:20:05,291 --> 01:20:07,116 
What did he say?

596
01:20:08,346 --> 01:20:09,754 
We have to go.

597
01:20:27,502 --> 01:20:28,764 
Esca?

598
01:20:39,724 --> 01:20:42,831 
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

599
01:20:42,866 --> 01:20:45,393 
Can I go with you?

600
01:20:45,428 --> 01:20:47,623 
Go back to your family.

601
01:20:47,658 --> 01:20:49,818 
My father will be angry.

602
01:20:53,624 --> 01:20:55,798 
You tell him,

603
01:20:55,833 --> 01:20:57,937 
when he wakes,

604
01:20:57,972 --> 01:21:01,924 
Esca’s sorry
but he has to go now.

605
01:21:01,959 --> 01:21:05,877 
Not until he wakes.
You understand?

606
01:21:05,912 --> 01:21:08,741 
Esca?

607
01:21:08,776 --> 01:21:11,550 
If he wakes them, we’re dead.
And you know it.

608
01:21:11,585 --> 01:21:12,926 
He has no reason
to protect us.

609
01:21:12,961 --> 01:21:14,751 
Do you trust me?

610
01:21:16,565 --> 01:21:18,390 
He won’t betray us.

611
01:22:08,934 --> 01:22:11,479 
They’ve gone?

612
01:22:13,575 --> 01:22:15,598 
They’ve gone!

613
01:22:22,876 --> 01:22:24,691 
Come on, come on!

614
01:22:46,735 --> 01:22:51,032 
- How many days to the wall?
- If we ride hard, four, maybe five.

615
01:22:52,053 --> 01:22:54,417 
They’ll never catch us on foot.

616
01:22:54,452 --> 01:22:57,924 
- Have you seen them run?
- Come on, come on.

617
01:23:23,212 --> 01:23:25,951 
You’re wounded.
Why didn’t you say?

618
01:23:25,986 --> 01:23:29,385 
- It's nothing.
- It's your bad leg. Sit down.

619
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:32,190 
- We don't have time.
- Just sit down.

620
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:46,769 
In the cave... the chief.
What did he say?

621
01:23:47,759 --> 01:23:50,564 
Come on,
there's no time right now.

622
01:24:11,535 --> 01:24:13,617 
They’re coming.

623
01:24:13,652 --> 01:24:17,260 
Half a day behind.
The wind always lies.

624
01:25:07,272 --> 01:25:10,265 
No fires.
It's too risky.

625
01:25:18,023 --> 01:25:22,820 
I’m not eating that.
I’m not a savage.

626
01:25:24,113 --> 01:25:25,938 
Then die a Roman.

627
01:25:28,513 --> 01:25:30,620 
You've lost a lot of blood.

628
01:25:32,215 --> 01:25:34,259 
You need to keep
your strength up.

629
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:39,025 
Eat.

630
01:26:23,573 --> 01:26:25,397 
It's time to go.

631
01:26:26,649 --> 01:26:28,755 
They can take shortcuts
that the horses can't.

632
01:26:36,534 --> 01:26:40,466 
Come on, keep going.
Come on!

633
01:26:42,395 --> 01:26:43,803 
Come on!

634
01:26:46,410 --> 01:26:47,525 
No!

635
01:28:30,355 --> 01:28:33,942 
We need to stick to the river.
They'll double back soon enough.

636
01:29:50,055 --> 01:29:52,610 
- Rest.
- We can't.

637
01:29:53,183 --> 01:29:55,008 
You need to rest!

638
01:29:56,552 --> 01:29:58,606 
Marcus!

639
01:30:01,004 --> 01:30:02,819 
You need to rest.

640
01:30:05,801 --> 01:30:07,209 
Come on.

641
01:30:09,764 --> 01:30:11,171 
Come on.

642
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:29,271 
I can’t go on.

643
01:30:29,306 --> 01:30:32,090 
Yes, you can.
You just need to rest.

644
01:30:35,072 --> 01:30:38,659 
Take the Eagle.
If you find horses come back.

645
01:30:40,901 --> 01:30:44,453 
If not,
just keep south!

646
01:30:44,488 --> 01:30:46,626 
Make sure,
this gets back to Rome.

647
01:30:46,661 --> 01:30:49,010 
I’m not leaving you here.

648
01:30:49,045 --> 01:30:52,309 
Do not dishonour me.
Take it.

649
01:30:52,344 --> 01:30:54,610 
I came this far with you,

650
01:30:54,645 --> 01:30:56,877 
I won't leave you now.

651
01:30:58,514 --> 01:31:02,800 
Esca, I order you.

652
01:31:02,835 --> 01:31:04,281 
Take it.

653
01:31:06,439 --> 01:31:08,952 
I swore an oath of honour,

654
01:31:08,987 --> 01:31:10,767 
never to abandon you!

655
01:31:13,551 --> 01:31:16,794 
If you want me to leave,

656
01:31:16,829 --> 01:31:19,203 
set me free.

657
01:31:20,569 --> 01:31:22,550 
Give me my freedom.

658
01:31:39,266 --> 01:31:41,164 
You’re free.

659
01:31:45,304 --> 01:31:47,588 
You’re free my friend.

660
01:31:54,950 --> 01:31:57,755 
- Take it.
- No.

661
01:32:04,283 --> 01:32:06,514 
I will return.

662
01:35:52,956 --> 01:35:55,948 
Legion! Halt!

663
01:35:58,117 --> 01:36:01,058 
Your father’s Legionaries.

664
01:36:01,093 --> 01:36:03,442 
You were wrong.

665
01:36:03,477 --> 01:36:05,792 
The dead can live.

666
01:36:07,794 --> 01:36:11,767 
My shame would not allow me
to tell you this before,

667
01:36:11,802 --> 01:36:14,301 
but I watched your father die.

668
01:36:16,085 --> 01:36:20,078 
Whatever anyone tells you,
he was not a coward.

669
01:36:21,121 --> 01:36:24,750 
He stood his ground,
to the very end.

670
01:36:26,669 --> 01:36:29,189 
I saw it.

671
01:36:29,224 --> 01:36:32,728 
The last Roman to hold the Eagle
was your father.

672
01:36:35,731 --> 01:36:38,056 
The order, sir.

673
01:36:39,839 --> 01:36:43,437 
You’ve honoured
my father’s memory enough.

674
01:36:43,472 --> 01:36:46,336 
- You don’t have to do this.
- No.

675
01:36:46,371 --> 01:36:48,442 
When I ran from your father,

676
01:36:52,144 --> 01:36:53,969 
I ran from myself.

677
01:37:00,789 --> 01:37:02,603 
Give the order, sir.

678
01:37:11,978 --> 01:37:14,564 
Prepare to defend the Eagle!

679
01:37:50,947 --> 01:37:52,271 
Esca!

680
01:37:54,169 --> 01:37:58,153 
To those who would betray their own kind,
I'll show you how to deal with them.

681
01:38:39,687 --> 01:38:42,471 
Out swords!

682
01:42:18,506 --> 01:42:23,052 
Let us remember the men
who fought and die, in the name of honour

683
01:42:23,865 --> 01:42:27,067 
Romans and Britains.

684
01:42:28,589 --> 01:42:30,810 
My father and yours.

685
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,849 
Fathers...

686
01:42:48,340 --> 01:42:49,737 
Brothers...

687
01:42:51,520 --> 01:42:53,116 
Sons...

688
01:42:55,785 --> 01:42:58,460 
May peace and honour follow you.

689
01:42:58,495 --> 01:43:01,135 
May you know no more strife.

690
01:43:02,887 --> 01:43:06,317 
May your souls
take flight and soar.

691
01:43:07,235 --> 01:43:10,207 
With the Eagle of the Ninth.

692
01:44:41,826 --> 01:44:44,016 
For my father.

693
01:44:52,327 --> 01:44:54,590 
My dear boy!

694
01:44:57,958 --> 01:45:01,650 
I congratulate you,
Rome congratulate you.

695
01:45:01,685 --> 01:45:04,455 
Your family's
good name is restored.

696
01:45:05,863 --> 01:45:09,877 
The senate will want
to reform the Ninth,

697
01:45:11,160 --> 01:45:14,810 
perhaps they can reward you
with its command.

698
01:45:16,655 --> 01:45:18,998 
I don't know
how did you do it.

699
01:45:19,033 --> 01:45:22,631 
- With only a slave to help you.
- He's not a slave.

700
01:45:24,341 --> 01:45:27,980 
And he knows more about honour
and freedom, than you ever will.

701
01:45:39,138 --> 01:45:40,817 
So, what now?

702
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,665 
You decide.

703
01:45:45,000 --> 01:45:48,051
