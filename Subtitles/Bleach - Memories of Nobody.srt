1
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,390
Hey!

2
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,160
Uh...hi.

3
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:29,080
What is the status?

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,450
The area has been expanding at constant rate.

5
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,580
The Stealth Force is on its way to investigate.

6
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,290
They should be entering shortly.

7
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,950
l've established contact.

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:44,810
They'll be passing by the Dangai Precipice World in ten seconds.

9
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:46,700
Opening communication lines.

10
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:52,290
<i>Hey! What–?! The exit!</i>

11
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,100
<i>We have an emergency!</i>

12
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,390
<i>We've failed to infiltrate the area!</i>

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,180
<i>Requesting immediate back-up! l repeat!</i>

14
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:05,680
Research Technology Comm center here. We copy your back-up request.

15
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,810
Requesting emergency opening of Senkaimon.

16
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,010
They have been left behind in the Dangai Precipice World.

17
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,010
Notify Central 46 immediately!

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,970
Hey! Can you hear me?

19
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:21,930
Why can't you infiltrate the area? Tell us!

20
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,470
Get ready!

21
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:28,220
Right!

22
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:31,850
Hey!

23
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:48,850
You're not getting away!

24
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:25,760
Not so easy!

25
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,180
lchigo.

26
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,010
Yeah?

27
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,970
lt seems that Hollow was after this child.

28
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:57,140
lt's all right. He only looks scary.

29
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,100
Shut up!

30
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,640
All right then, let's go.

31
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:07,600
Don't worry. Soul Society is not a scary place.

32
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,270
lt's where all the souls come from.

33
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,010
But...

34
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,680
lf you stay here, another monster like that will come after you.

35
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,260
ls it over already?

36
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:10,850
Yes.

37
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,510
Thanks.

38
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,850
lchigo.

39
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,470
Huh?

40
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,810
Don't use your Combat Pass so freely.

41
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,720
Huh? Why?

42
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,680
Oww!

43
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,430
What's the big idea?!

44
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,850
You have him.

45
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,970
You keep leaving your body here and there, and thanks to that,

46
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,510
l'm the one who has to deal with the messy aftermath.

47
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,510
Why's that?

48
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:41,140
For example...

49
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,180
A passerby approaches.

50
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,140
"Excuse me, is something wrong?"

51
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,350
"Oh no, this man isn't breathing!"

52
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,220
"Ambulance. No, if he's dead, l must get a hearse!"

53
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,140
Get the idea?

54
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,560
Like they'd call a hearse!

55
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,810
That's not the point!

56
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,310
ln any case, it's a big hassle if there's a commotion.

57
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,260
Hurry! He's in cardiac arrest!

58
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,470
Too late...

59
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,680
M-My body!

60
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:17,220
You...!

61
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,180
Uh, hi.

62
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:20,220
Are you all right?

63
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:23,510
You still need to lie down!

64
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,010
l'm telling you, l'm fine!

65
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:27,430
Hey, hold him down! He's delirious!

66
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,430
Stop it!

67
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:28,760
Really...

68
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:39,600
Man, that was bad.

69
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,060
That's my line!

70
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,930
You're lucky l had a Memory Replacement to switch everyone's memory.

71
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:46,470
Kon.

72
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:48,140
Yes, yes!

73
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,930
Hey...

74
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,850
What's with you?!

75
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:53,720
There's no point unless you hold him!

76
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,100
Why do l wanna...!

77
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,760
Nee-san, l absolutely...!

78
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,720
Shut up!

79
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:00,890
What?

80
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,810
S-Stop! l'll get dirty!

81
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,390
Shut up!

82
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:05,180
There's dog poop over there!

83
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,430
Hope it sticks to you!

84
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,850
What's the meaning of this?

85
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:11,100
What? Another Hollow?

86
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,100
Take this!

87
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,930
lt got in my mouth!

88
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:15,600
lchigo.

89
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,810
Serves you right!

90
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,510
You've done it this time!

91
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:21,930
Hey!

92
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,220
Wait! l'm dealing with him...

93
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,140
The train station!

94
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:28,890
Hey!

95
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,890
What's with this Spiritual Pressure?

96
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:37,220
l don't know. l've never experienced this kind of Spiritual Pressure before.

97
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:20,890
What the hell are they?

98
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,140
White ghosts?!

99
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:27,100
No one else can see them.

100
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:29,890
They must be spirit beings.

101
00:08:29,890 --> 00:08:32,770
But they don't have chains on their chests.

102
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,220
What's...

103
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,510
We have no choice.

104
00:08:36,810 --> 00:08:37,970
What? Again?

105
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,640
Use him!

106
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,640
Disgusting...

107
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,350
Kon! Go hide somewhere!

108
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,850
Hey, don't leave me.. !

109
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
Hey, what are you doing?!

110
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,810
This is Squad 13's Kuchiki Rukia in World of the Living area 3888!

111
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,640
Rukia!

112
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,930
lchigo, try performing a Konso!

113
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,260
What?! A Konso?!

114
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,600
Unidentified spirit beings...

115
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,970
What the hell... lt's worth a try.

116
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,850
lt's not working on these guys...

117
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,850
Wait!

118
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:27,890
My connection with Soul Society...

119
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:36,560
What's going on?!

120
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:40,850
Stop!

121
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,560
Rukia!

122
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,100
What's this all of a sudden?!

123
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,430
Stop! Stop!

124
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,010
What's the deal with you guys?! Move it!

125
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,060
What'll we do?

126
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,970
Well...

127
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,390
What the–?!

128
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,220
A shinigami?!

129
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,720
What are you doing?!

130
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,390
Hey!

131
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,930
Oww! Oww! Hey, don't step on me!

132
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,390
What's that?

133
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,560
She's going to release her zanpakuto!

134
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,140
What?

135
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,600
Call forth the Twilight...

136
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,350
lchigo!

137
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:59,850
Stop! What the hell are you doing?!

138
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:02,350
Those things aren't Hollows!

139
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,850
Shut your mouth, stupid!

140
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:04,470
Stu...?!

141
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:11,390
Hey! You stepped on my face...

142
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,640
Call Forth the Twilight!

143
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,060
Mirokumaru!

144
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,020
What?!

145
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,680
Now what?

146
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,640
Huh? What happened to that other guy?

147
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,310
Sorry to keep you waiting!

148
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:55,220
Wasn't that wind so strong?

149
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,390
What's going on?

150
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,060
They vanished.

151
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,060
Yes! That was awesome!

152
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,510
That felt so good!

153
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,930
Oh, it's you.

154
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,390
YOU!

155
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:20,970
How'd you change into gigai so quickly?

156
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:21,970
l dunno.

157
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,930
Just who are you?

158
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:25,350
l'm a shinigami.

159
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,260
l know that!

160
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,470
lf you want to know someone's name, shouldn't you introduce yourself first?

161
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,100
l'm Kurosaki Ichigo.

162
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,720
Oh, you're pretty obedient.

163
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,310
My name is Senna.

164
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,010
 Later!

165
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:42,390
Don't "Later" me! Why'd you do such a thing?

166
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,220
Why not?

167
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,100
Do you know something about those things?

168
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,970
Hey! What's the matter?

169
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,350
This is bad! l knew it!

170
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,310
What is it?!

171
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,510
Hmm... yellow just isn't my color.

172
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,850
Never mind that. Come!

173
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,260
lchigo, right?

174
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,180
Yeah.

175
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,680
Over there!

176
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:09,600
There's an unconscious man...

177
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:11,260
Kon!

178
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,680
Not again!

179
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,930
See, you better hurry!

180
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,520
Not so fast!

181
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,260
Come with me!

182
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,850
Hey!

183
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:20,390
l just want to ask you some questions!

184
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,310
The fool...

185
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,350
Give up already?

186
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,850
You gotta be kidding!

187
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:54,970
You really think it's okay for a lieutenant to be drinking in the middle of the day?

188
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:59,350
What're you saying? This is like drinking water.

189
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,640
Hey! lt's empty already.

190
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,970
What?! Already?!

191
00:14:03,970 --> 00:14:06,970
You drink too much, you shaded geezer!

192
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,930
Shut up, baldie!

193
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:12,060
What?! Wanna go another round?!

194
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,930
Fine! Whoever loses gets the sake.

195
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,310
Got it ?!

196
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,470
Taking the high ground again?

197
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,310
The quicker one gets it!

198
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,720
Whatever. Here l...

199
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,810
What's the matter?!

200
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,260
What is that thing?

201
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,060
A Ferris wheel! Look!

202
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,140
l didn't know they had one of these here.

203
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,350
Anyway, what were you saying?

204
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,890
What squad do you belong to?!

205
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:06,350
l don't remember such things.

206
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,060
Hmm... what squad did l belong to?

207
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,310
Listen here. You wield a zanpakuto and know how to release it.

208
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:17,010
There is no question that you are a shinigami.

209
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,640
And if you are a shinigami, you must belong to a squad!

210
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,640
How can you not remember that?

211
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,310
Question, please!

212
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:27,390
Why are you here?

213
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,680
Well, that's...

214
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,010
Hey!

215
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:32,850
l said l forgot!

216
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,430
What does it matter, anyway?

217
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:39,350
Then do you know what those guys were back there?

218
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:41,510
Don't know that either.

219
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,640
Oh, he's so cute! Can l pet him?

220
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,430
Sure.

221
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:48,430
But l thought l should take care of them that way.

222
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,810
lnstinct.

223
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,930
You know what l mean?

224
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,260
What's with her?!

225
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:00,180
lchigo, l'm going to Soul Society.

226
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,220
l'm having trouble contacting them.

227
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,430
And l'm concerned about the phenomenon earlier, too.

228
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:10,810
Do not let that girl out of your sight!

229
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:13,220
Hey you! Trying to dump it on me.. !

230
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,810
Ahhh... nee-san... not again...

231
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,060
l'm counting on you.

232
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,600
Boy, what's she so uptight about?

233
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,470
Hey, lchigo!

234
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,810
Stupid, don't shout like that here!

235
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:25,720
She's gone!

236
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,680
Damm!

237
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,220
Hey!

238
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,010
Jeez, you're so persistent!

239
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,310
Hey, wait!

240
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:58,180
Remember when you told me that if l answered your questions, you'd do anything l asked you to?

241
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,680
l never said anything like that!

242
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,810
Let's play tag!

243
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,180
Hey! l told you! l never said such thing.

244
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:09,310
Wait!

245
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:15,810
Jeez!

246
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,930
Hey, come on out!

247
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Where'd you go?

248
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,220
Hey, what's with all the fun and games?

249
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:27,930
Rangiku-san? Toshiro?

250
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,140
lt's been a while...

251
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:32,350
lt's not Toshiro. It's Captain Hitsugaya!

252
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,560
What're you two doing here anyway?

253
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,220
Wait up!

254
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,140
We need to talk.

255
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,180
Err, well, now's not...

256
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,760
Just come!

257
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,470
Hey!

258
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:46,430
Hey! Dammit!

259
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,680
l'll come back. You wait!

260
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,260
That man is talking to himself.

261
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:04,060
l see... Kuchiki-san went to Soul Society?

262
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,350
You just missed her then.

263
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,390
Well, where shall we start?

264
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,010
At 12:50AM today, above the Seireitei suddenly appeared a town from the World of the Living.

265
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:20,680
We also detected a trail of spiritual waves flowing into this world.

266
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:24,060
One minute later, we lost all communication between the two worlds.

267
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,970
What're you talking about?

268
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:28,560
Don't you even understand this much?

269
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,890
Now now...

270
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:32,350
l'll explain it to you in a simple manner.

271
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:38,560
First off, there are the World of the Living and the Soul Society.

272
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:45,850
Between them is the Dangai Precipice World, to keep these worlds from colliding.

273
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:48,680
You ran through it once. Remember?

274
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,970
However, about three days ago,

275
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:56,970
a new dimension appeared between the Soul Society and the World of the Living.

276
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,060
lt began to expand, bridging the gap and adhering to both worlds.

277
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,180
At this point, it appears the area that attached itself is acting like a lens

278
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,970
and the World of the Living is being visible

279
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,600
from the Soul Society, which is in a different dimension.

280
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,390
l guess you can say it's like a mirage.

281
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:18,970
The Stealth Force was sent out to investigate this newly created dimension, but they failed.

282
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,260
Our only choice now is...

283
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,850
to check out the influx of spiritual waves into the World of the Living.

284
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,180
lt was decided that l would head up the operation.

285
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,910
Why you?

286
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,910
The other captains backed out.

287
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,470
Never mind that!

288
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,450
Then it was probably those guys.

289
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,910
You saw something?

290
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:41,080
Yeah...

291
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,640
hoards of 'em, all white wearing pointy red hats.

292
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,410
Blanks...

293
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:49,390
As suspected, the Valley of Screams.

294
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,930
All right then. Explanation Number Two. Ready?

295
00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,550
As you know, souls migrate between World of the Living and Soul Society.

296
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:08,050
From time to time however, some may encounter accidents and become detached from this Cycle of Transmigration.

297
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:13,930
These souls wander aimlessly through the Dangai Precipice World and are slowly drawn together.

298
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,260
As the souls come together, it causes a new dimension.

299
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,010
lt is known as the Valley of Screams.

300
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:26,470
There, the souls separate into memory and energy in preparation to return to the Cycle of Transmigration.

301
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,890
Are you following me?

302
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,100
l'm following!

303
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,350
Kurosaki-san, the ones you saw were the souls with no memory, Blanks.

304
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,720
What happens to the memories?

305
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,930
The memories merge into one entity and return to the World of the Living.

306
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,890
Hence, it is called a Shinenju.

307
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:50,640
That is the name for the collective of memories.

308
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,220
The appearance of the Valley of Screams is a natural phenomenon.

309
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,930
And it's existence has been verified a number of times...

310
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,100
But the problem is...

311
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:06,390
the Valley of Screams has connected World of the Living and Soul Society.

312
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,580
ls it that unnatural?

313
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,580
There's no way a tunnel connecting two stars can be created naturally!

314
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,350
This is the same thing!

315
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:18,870
There's no doubt that someone is doing this deliberately.

316
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,660
Hey! Speaking of which...!

317
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,620
Huh? What is it?

318
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:28,700
There were some guys wearing strange armor with those white monsters!

319
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,870
l saw it!

320
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,410
Armor?

321
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:34,240
Do you remember it in more detail?

322
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,280
Of course, l remember!

323
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,700
Uhh... now let's see.

324
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,910
l remember... l mean...

325
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,200
Let me analyze this.

326
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,160
Yes, please do.

327
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:56,370
Anyway, if this is being done intentionally, then it is done with a grudge.

328
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,830
What do they want?

329
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,030
Well, l don't know.

330
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:00,870
lt's just...

331
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:03,450
l have this feeling...

332
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:08,310
that they're looking for the Shinenju returned to the World of the Living.

333
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,870
That's my hunch.

334
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:17,120
We'll try to identify the enemy.

335
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,870
Kurosaki-san, please keep watch over the town.

336
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:22,780
They are bound to appear again.

337
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:26,680
And, if possible... find the Shinenju.

338
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:30,990
Yeah, but... l still have to find that girl, too...

339
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,370
Oh, sorry!

340
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,410
What should l do?

341
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,200
Wow! You really came back?!

342
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,740
Over here! Over here!

343
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:00,120
Of course! l still have questions l wanna ask.

344
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,310
Fine! Let's pick up where we left off! You're it!

345
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,450
Hey, listen.. !

346
00:23:09,030 --> 00:23:10,350
That little.. !

347
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,160
All right... here goes with the legendary performance!

348
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,350
Take a deep breath...!

349
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:26,120
Ready, and go!

350
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,030
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

351
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,120
lt's all gone!

352
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,370
Well done!

353
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,700
Wasn't that too fast?!

354
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,830
No such thing. lt's good!

355
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,990
Over there! Up there!

356
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,830
Senna...!

357
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,370
What's that?

358
00:23:59,370 --> 00:23:59,910
Huh?!

359
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,280
What's she doing?

360
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,680
ls it some kind of act?

361
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:26,700
This feels so nice.

362
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,330
Where'd she go?

363
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,410
She disappeared!

364
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,580
No, in the back!

365
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:58,160
How was that, everyone?!

366
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,370
C'mon, join me!

367
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:02,660
Err... Later.

368
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,740
No fair, they're getting more attention than us!

369
00:25:07,970 --> 00:25:09,100
Achoo!

370
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,990
Itadakimasu!

371
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,200
lf you'd said you were treating, l'd have answered anything!

372
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,030
You didn't have any money?

373
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,910
So what about it?

374
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,910
What about what?

375
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,830
l just explained it to you.

376
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:34,990
ls there anything you know about the Blanks and the Shinenju?

377
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:37,450
Nope, l don't know anything.

378
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:42,450
So someone used those pointy-hat things to look for...

379
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,740
Shinen...what was it?

380
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,080
Shinenju.

381
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,410
Look for that thing, right?

382
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,530
Yeah.

383
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,850
So who is this someone?

384
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,160
We're checking into that, too.

385
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,560
For what?

386
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,450
l dunno.

387
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,390
Have you got any idea what this Shinenju looks like?

388
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,770
Not a clue.

389
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:04,530
You're no help at all.

390
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:08,740
You just have to wait until the pointy-hats appear again, right?

391
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:13,240
Oh well, l'll help.

392
00:26:15,410 --> 00:26:17,200
But in return...

393
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,910
l knew it!

394
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:19,830
That!

395
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:20,700
That?

396
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,030
Take me for a ride on that and l'll help you with whatever you want!

397
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,410
l'm not fallin' for that again.

398
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:28,240
Hey!

399
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,770
You love heights, don't you?

400
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:34,910
lf you look at things from above,

401
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:39,220
all the things that seem confusing or messed up... suddenly become clear.

402
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,490
Hey, that ribbon.

403
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:42,950
Oh, you noticed?

404
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:46,080
Don't you think red is cuter?

405
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,450
l don't mean that. How'd you get it?

406
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,870
l saw it in some shop, tried it on...

407
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:55,200
and forgot about it.

408
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,450
lt happens often, doesn't it?

409
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,740
No way! Come with me!

410
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,030
What about the tab here?

411
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,620
l'd like to buy this.

412
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,370
A present for your girlfriend?

413
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,200
No!

414
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
l'll gift wrap it for you.

415
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,870
l'll take it as is!

416
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:22,410
Thank you!

417
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,620
Here.

418
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:30,660
You're unexpectedly uptight, actually going back to pay for it.

419
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,330
Shut up!

420
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:35,200
l hate that kind of thing.

421
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,330
Thank you! What about the Ferris wheel?

422
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:38,830
Absolutely not.

423
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:39,870
Meany!

424
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,240
High-schoolers don't have that much money.

425
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,530
Hey!

426
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,700
Shut up. l'm just going to the restroom!

427
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,910
He's quite nice.

428
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,950
There! All right!

429
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:19,240
<i>That river...</i>

430
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,580
<i>Dad!</i>

431
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,740
Welcome home!

432
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,990
<i>Dad..?</i>

433
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:50,030
<i>Mom, l'm hungry!</i>

434
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,370
<i>l know. Take your seat.</i>

435
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,580
<i>Okay then, cheers!</i>

436
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,280
What's taking so long?!

437
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,830
This place was so crowded a minute ago.

438
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,780
<i>This... is my...</i>

439
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,080
<i>This is my funeral?</i>

440
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:08,370
<i>Dad? Mom?</i>

441
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,280
<i>Those things from earlier...</i>

442
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:22,200
<i>What?!</i>

443
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,990
Now what?!

444
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,950
You've got better reflexes than l expected.

445
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,370
What do you want with me?

446
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:39,030
Come with us.

447
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:42,280
Our lord, Ganryu-sama, summons you!

448
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,700
Ganryu? Never heard of him.

449
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:51,160
There's no need for you to know him, since you are the...

450
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,160
Jai!

451
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,030
l told you not to blab.

452
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:59,160
Jumping out like that...

453
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,030
l'll catch her in an instant.

454
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,950
Oh, that tickles.

455
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,030
Don't crush her.

456
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:20,120
Hurry it up. Let's go.

457
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,910
Now then, let's go.

458
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,200
Hold it!

459
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,660
Where do you think you're going?

460
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:38,280
You... where did you come from?!

461
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:45,030
My arm...my arm!

462
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,830
What's with all the wandering off?

463
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:51,080
lchigo... That's my own business!

464
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,240
No way. You're gonna keep your promise.

465
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,030
Hey, big guy. Sorry about that.

466
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,580
You won't get away with this! l won't let you!

467
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,410
Jai! Enough.

468
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,330
lt is not yet the time.

469
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,200
Time? What're you talking about?

470
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,410
Dammit!

471
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:13,910
Hey, hold on!

472
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,330
Hey!

473
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,950
You let someone treat you, then run off?

474
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:23,620
l didn't run away!

475
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,580
Then what?

476
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,740
My family grave is here.

477
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,950
Cut the crap.

478
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,580
lt's true. l remember it.

479
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,870
lt's hazy, but l remember when l was alive.

480
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:40,200
That's why l came here for a look.

481
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,950
My house used to be around here, too.

482
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:49,160
l'll help you tomorrow for sure. l'm not lying.

483
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,330
See you!

484
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,990
You idiot. Like l can abandon someone who was just attacked.

485
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:03,490
That's fishy.

486
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,970
Bad guys are after her?

487
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,240
Well, at any rate, it's just for one night.

488
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,370
l'm Senna.

489
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:12,990
l'm Kurosaki Yuzu. Welcome.

490
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:14,580
Thanks for having me.

491
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,660
Hey Yuzu, let her sleep in your room.

492
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,870
And let her bathe, too.

493
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,740
Okay.

494
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,200
What's the matter, Dad?

495
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,620
Hey! Yuzu, you too?

496
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,620
Come in until your bed's ready.

497
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,240
Hmm... boys' rooms are always so drab and boring.

498
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Don't start.

499
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,780
You seem to have a nice family.

500
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,660
You think?

501
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,030
My dad too. He was...

502
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,780
Hey!

503
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,780
What's the matter?

504
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:03,410
Oh, nothing.

505
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:07,030
By the way, why were those guys after you?

506
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,030
Did they say anything?

507
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:13,950
Hmm... something about Gan-whatever wanted me brought to him.

508
00:34:13,950 --> 00:34:14,700
And?

509
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,030
That's all.

510
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,450
lf you hadn't come by, l might've learned more.

511
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:22,030
What?! Hey, don't sleep in my bed!

512
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,410
Why? There's nothing wrong with it.

513
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,370
Of course there is!

514
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,450
<i>Hey, don't lift your legs up!</i>

515
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,580
<i>You're such a bother!</i>

516
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,450
<i>No, l'm not!</i>

517
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,660
Stop it!

518
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,990
She says she's gonna sleep in his bed!

519
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:33,990
Well, lchigo-nii is a man, after all.

520
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,240
Oh, Masaki, it's the day we've been dreading!

521
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,220
What am l to do?

522
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,890
Hey! What's goin' on out here?

523
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:43,740
See, he's all mad.

524
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:45,780
The bath is ready.

525
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,830
Cripes!

526
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:51,580
Hey Senna, take a bath and then go to sleep.

527
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:53,910
Hey!

528
00:35:05,410 --> 00:35:08,240
<i>Kurosaki-san, it's me Urahara.</i>

529
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:11,990
<i>Any leads on the Shinenju?</i>

530
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:13,450
Nope.

531
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:17,200
But l encountered the enemy Kon was talking about.

532
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,660
<i>Are you hurt?</i>

533
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,660
l'm fine. They took off right away.

534
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,910
l see.

535
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,830
About that, we were able to turn up a few things up on our end.

536
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:28,600
<i>What?</i>

537
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,620
<i>After analyzing the visual images taken from Kon's memories...</i>

538
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:37,740
<i>We identified the armor as belonging to the clan</i>

539
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:44,990
<i>that was banished a long time ago from the Soul Society after their take-over attempt failed.</i>

540
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:49,740
<i>So we know for sure that they hold a grudge against us.</i>

541
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,490
<i>But we still don't know what they're after.</i>

542
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,030
Urahara-san, can l ask you one thing?

543
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,160
<i>What is it?</i>

544
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:04,140
Can a shinigami have memories of when they were alive?

545
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:08,200
Let's see... l doubt that very much.

546
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,560
Why do you ask?

547
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:14,490
No reason... just curious.

548
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:26,530
Say, do you really think they'll show up again?

549
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:27,830
l dunno...

550
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,200
But the only lead we have is that we saw the Blanks here.

551
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,080
Aww, this is boring.

552
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,450
Man, why so many people?

553
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,240
lt's usually less crowded around this time of hour...

554
00:36:47,530 --> 00:36:50,280
Senna, don't go too far from my side.

555
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,030
Hey!

556
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,410
Hey Senna!

557
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,200
Over here!

558
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,990
You were just attacked yesterday!

559
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,620
Don't go wandering off like that!

560
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,280
A soul?

561
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,740
Hey, what's the matter?

562
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,700
You're scaring him.

563
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,990
My name's Senna. What's yours?

564
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:27,370
Tomoya.

565
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:29,030
Tomoya-kun, huh?

566
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:31,990
Will you tell me what's wrong?

567
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:37,450
Umm... my dad's gone...

568
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:40,030
You were with your dad?

569
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,330
Uh-huh. We were driving to the festival,

570
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,330
but when l looked, he was gone.

571
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,580
l see...

572
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:53,740
Well then... your dad is probably in heaven and...

573
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:55,660
That's not true!

574
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,240
Dad is looking for me!

575
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,280
Okay! Then we'll help you find your dad.

576
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,200
Really?

577
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,680
Really! Really!

578
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,160
Tomoya-kun, which way did you come from?

579
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,120
Over that way!

580
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,370
Then let's go.

581
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:09,850
Hey!

582
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:12,780
Hey! Right now, we have to...

583
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,870
But we have no leads, right?

584
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,450
Let's go.

585
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:16,560
No sense in hanging around here.

586
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,080
Okay!

587
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,870
Hey, how long're you gonna keep at it?

588
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,330
There's no festival around here.

589
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:29,990
Besides, there's no guarantee that his father is still on this side.

590
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,870
We'll find him.

591
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:35,740
That boy has to leave this world soon.

592
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,330
And a long journey awaits him...

593
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:43,950
lt's his last wish. How sad if it doesn't come true.

594
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,370
l can't bring myself to perform a Konso like this.

595
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,580
l want to at least give him...

596
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:58,240
a good last memory.

597
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,950
Nee-chan!

598
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,160
What is it?

599
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:05,370
Onee-chan! This way! This way!

600
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,490
Onee-chan... my dad...

601
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:30,870
Let's find him.

602
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,180
Don't worry.

603
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:31,620
Okay.

604
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:37,910
l'm so glad this place is still here.

605
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:40,120
l came here a lot as a child.

606
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,870
You...

607
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,100
Tomoya.

608
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,720
Tomoya!

609
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,240
Dad!

610
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:52,330
Dad...

611
00:40:56,530 --> 00:40:59,740
l'm sorry... l'm so sorry.

612
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:04,910
l don't believe this...

613
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,870
Thank you so much!

614
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,200
l'm happy for you.

615
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,080
Uh-huh.

616
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:14,200
lt's all thanks to you.

617
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,830
No, l didn't do anything.

618
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:22,950
l see. Could it be that you haven't noticed?

619
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:27,620
All these souls gathered around you here.

620
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:32,830
l was able to find this place thanks to them.

621
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,280
These people...?

622
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,910
Uh-huh...all of them here.

623
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:44,080
How weird. You're the one who called them here.

624
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,740
Tomoya...

625
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,660
Now we can go on our journey.

626
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,270
{\fad(0,1590)}Bye bye.

627
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,080
Hey!

628
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,950
Wait a minute.

629
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,280
These guys...?!

630
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:11,910
Why...

631
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:18,910
Why do they come around me?

632
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,580
lchigo...

633
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,660
actually...

634
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:27,930
l'm...

635
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,520
actually...

636
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,080
Senna...

637
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,910
Ukitake-san?

638
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,660
What's wrong?

639
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,370
Rukia, what happened?

640
00:42:55,830 --> 00:42:56,780
Well...

641
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:02,120
This is a Level One order from Central 46.

642
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,990
lchigo, hand over that girl!

643
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,030
What?!

644
00:43:06,030 --> 00:43:06,890
lchigo,

645
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:10,030
l went through every record of the Thirteen Court Guard Squads,

646
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:14,810
the Stealth Force, the Kido Force, and the Shinigami Academy...

647
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:16,830
There is no Senna listed anywhere!

648
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:21,450
And the zanpakuto the girl uses, Mirokumaru...

649
00:43:21,450 --> 00:43:24,530
lt has been verified that it was swallowed up by the Restrictive Current

650
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:26,740
in the Dangai Precipice World 100 years ago along with its owner.

651
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:31,640
ln other words, it cannot possibly exist today.

652
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,160
Wait a minute! What are you saying?

653
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:37,580
l'm a shinigami...

654
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,990
Then when did you come to the World of the Living?

655
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,410
Well...

656
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:47,160
Two days ago l woke up by the banks of that river.

657
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:50,620
But l remember my own name clearly.

658
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:54,990
And that river... l've known it since l was a child...

659
00:43:54,990 --> 00:43:57,080
But... why?

660
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,910
l'm supposed to be just me...

661
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,580
See? All kinds of memories are mixed up in your head, right?

662
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:06,030
lt's hard to believe...

663
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:10,330
But the collective of memories you are searching for, the Shinenju,

664
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:11,060
is you.

665
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:15,200
l'm...

666
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:19,490
The Valley of Screams became visible twenty-four hours ago...

667
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:23,600
Soul Society has concluded that Ganryu wants to destroy the worlds...

668
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:28,530
and that a crucial element in his plans is the Shinenju.

669
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:30,870
The Shinenju Senna!

670
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:36,160
Soul Society will now take you into custody!

671
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,450
That's ridiculous?!

672
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:44,200
What are you saying? l'm...

673
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,160
Even l'm...!

674
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:49,740
Hold it. lt just doesn't sit well with me.

675
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:52,180
lchigo, what are you..?!

676
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:57,910
No matter what this girl is, she exists at this moment.

677
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:00,240
She gets mad, she gets happy, she gets hurt...

678
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,560
she has feelings, doesn't she?

679
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,100
But you're gonna ignore that and take her into custody?!

680
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:08,490
Then you're no different from them!

681
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:12,180
l'm not handing Senna over to you.

682
00:45:13,370 --> 00:45:16,870
Sorry, but this is not the time to debate.

683
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,700
Move, lchigo!

684
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,490
Can't do that.

685
00:45:25,910 --> 00:45:27,660
What's that?!

686
00:45:38,870 --> 00:45:39,990
Renji!

687
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:41,700
Matsumoto!

688
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,330
These guys!

689
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,740
Behind you!

690
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,520
Hey kid... today, you will turn the Shinenju over to us.

691
00:46:12,490 --> 00:46:16,080
Hah! You wanna lose your other arm too?!

692
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,080
lchigo!

693
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,240
Kon, take care of her!

694
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,740
Right!

695
00:46:32,530 --> 00:46:35,100
He has much more power than yesterday!

696
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,830
Protect the Shinenju!

697
00:46:46,030 --> 00:46:47,580
What are these things?!

698
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:52,060
Sit Upon the Frozen Heavens! Hyorinmaru!

699
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:05,770
Howl! Zabimaru!

700
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,240
What?!

701
00:47:12,220 --> 00:47:14,160
Sogyo no Kotowari!

702
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:15,780
Go, Kuchiki!

703
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,370
Yes, sir!

704
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,370
Get outta the way!

705
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,030
Nee-san!

706
00:47:21,030 --> 00:47:23,770
Hado 33: Sokatsui!

707
00:47:24,450 --> 00:47:25,370
You're in my way!

708
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:26,950
Hey!

709
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:29,870
l am a shinigami!

710
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:38,140
Call Forth the Twilight!

711
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:39,580
Don't!

712
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,240
Mirokumaru!

713
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:51,490
Senna!

714
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,830
That pattern on the armor belongs to the banished clan...

715
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,160
The once noble House of Ryodoji!

716
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,620
l wouldn't know.

717
00:48:05,830 --> 00:48:08,870
We are from the Clan of Darkness, the Dark One.

718
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:11,270
What?!

719
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,390
You won't get away!

720
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:29,450
Let's go.

721
00:48:40,620 --> 00:48:42,410
You've got some nerve!

722
00:48:45,450 --> 00:48:47,120
Hey, let go of me!

723
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:48,850
Senna!

724
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:50,780
l'm coming for you!

725
00:48:57,780 --> 00:48:59,560
Senna, l won't hand her over!

726
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:06,990
You're mine...!

727
00:49:16,430 --> 00:49:17,450
lchigo!

728
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,430
lchigo?

729
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:28,280
lchigo!

730
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,700
He's okay now.

731
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,830
Thank you. l'm glad you all came to help.

732
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:11,490
Sheesh, he's hopeless.

733
00:50:11,490 --> 00:50:13,740
No such thing.

734
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:18,780
lt was a surprise attack, even three squad captains couldn't fend them off.

735
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:20,160
lt couldn't be helped.

736
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,200
Boss...

737
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,830
What about the squad members?

738
00:50:22,830 --> 00:50:25,830
Unfortunately, they lost track of the enemy.

739
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,620
Have you been able to learn anything else?

740
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:33,530
lt seems they plan to use the power of the Shinenju

741
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:37,740
to pull the World of the Living and the Soul Society together

742
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,780
to make them collide.

743
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:41,950
No way...!

744
00:50:41,950 --> 00:50:44,410
lt's hard to believe.

745
00:50:44,410 --> 00:50:46,370
But that's the only explanation.

746
00:50:46,870 --> 00:50:48,740
What about the Soul Society?

747
00:50:48,740 --> 00:50:52,780
They should be working on the next plan of action. Just...

748
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:57,180
From the Soul Society it's not possible to access the Valley of Screams.

749
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,620
Without an entryway, it's impossible to enter another world.

750
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:04,870
lsn't there any other way?

751
00:51:04,870 --> 00:51:12,030
Well, there should be an entrance in the World of the Living, which was created when the Shinenju appeared.

752
00:51:12,030 --> 00:51:13,700
l see.

753
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:14,950
lchigo!

754
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,740
lf we find the entrance, we can go after them.

755
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,850
Right, Urahara-san?

756
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:24,990
Yes.

757
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,200
Let's go!

758
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:30,490
lchigo!

759
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:35,780
We have no choice. Let's go and search, too.

760
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,740
Right!

761
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:45,200
<i>There are no traces of any gunpowder or chemical residue.</i>

762
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:48,390
<i>What is going on here?!</i>

763
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:15,430
lchigo... l...

764
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:20,620
It's not really your fault.

765
00:52:20,620 --> 00:52:23,740
She's self-centered and stubborn and a little crazy...

766
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:27,830
But she was trembling.

767
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:36,740
Deep down, she was frightened that she didn't know who she really was.

768
00:52:39,830 --> 00:52:43,240
And yet...

769
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:45,240
And yet, l couldn't protect her.

770
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:48,910
<i>Oh, you noticed?</i>

771
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,910
<i>Don't you think red is cuter?</i>

772
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,410
<i>lf l answered your questions, you'd do anything l asked you to?</i>

773
00:52:58,030 --> 00:53:00,410
<i>lf you look at things from above,</i>

774
00:53:00,410 --> 00:53:04,910
<i>all the things that seem confusing or messed up suddenly become clear.</i>

775
00:53:06,370 --> 00:53:09,160
Why'd she say that...?

776
00:53:13,810 --> 00:53:15,870
lchigo, what's wrong?

777
00:53:15,870 --> 00:53:17,870
Rukia, come with me.

778
00:53:17,870 --> 00:53:18,660
O-Okay.

779
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:52,280
<i>l remember when l was alive.</i>

780
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:54,490
<i>My house used to be around here, too.</i>

781
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:57,910
There... in the river.

782
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,240
What is that?!

783
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:21,990
This is the same phenomenon that's visible from the Soul Society!

784
00:54:21,990 --> 00:54:23,490
We can go through it!

785
00:54:23,490 --> 00:54:26,030
Rukia, contact Urahara-san.

786
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:28,830
W-Wait, lchigo! You can't go alone...

787
00:54:28,830 --> 00:54:29,950
l'm going!

788
00:54:31,370 --> 00:54:35,020
l'm gonna save her no matter what!

789
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:36,160
lchigo!

790
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,950
What is this place...?

791
00:55:34,950 --> 00:55:37,850
l thought you wanted me to do something for you!

792
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:41,770
We just need you to be the instrument through which...

793
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,530
...we fulfill our dream.

794
00:55:44,530 --> 00:55:45,660
What are you talking about?!

795
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,910
Lower your voice!

796
00:55:47,910 --> 00:55:53,280
Ganryu-sama is the rightful ruler of Soul Society!

797
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,780
lt's all right. l abandoned such formalities long ago.

798
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:04,740
One thousand years have passed since my grandfather was banished from Soul Society.

799
00:56:04,740 --> 00:56:08,830
We wandered in exile in this Dangai Precipice World...

800
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:13,830
and survived by evading the Restrictive Current, which swallows up everything that touches it.

801
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:19,620
We learned to use the souls who had strayed from the Cycle of Transmigration

802
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:27,160
and turned into wandering ghosts in the Dangai Precipice World as a source of power.

803
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,490
The number of souls is always constant.

804
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:41,830
lf these souls, or "Blanks" who have strayed from the Cycle of Transmigration

805
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,120
reach a certain number...

806
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:48,700
they generate a dimension known as the Valley of Screams.

807
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:53,490
ln other words, this space was created by countless Blanks.

808
00:56:53,490 --> 00:57:00,530
And at the same time, all the memories of these lost souls merge and return to the World of the Living.

809
00:57:00,530 --> 00:57:02,620
That is the Shinenju...

810
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:04,990
ln other words... you!

811
00:57:04,990 --> 00:57:09,370
However, the Blanks do not lose their individuality right away.

812
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,080
Even though the Blanks are basically empty vessels,

813
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:15,280
they still wander for a time, searching for their memories.

814
00:57:21,870 --> 00:57:24,450
This is where the problem begins.

815
00:57:24,450 --> 00:57:27,580
Placing the Shinenju at the center of the Valley of Screams

816
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:31,120
will activate the Blanks' natural desire to seek their memories...

817
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:37,200
and will drive them to rush towards the Shinenju, causing the Valley of Screams to contract.

818
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,910
This force will be strong enough to pull the World of the Living

819
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:46,030
and Soul Society, separated by the Dangai Precipice World, into a collision.

820
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:47,100
What?!

821
00:57:47,950 --> 00:57:50,740
That's a disturbing thought...

822
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:54,030
Furthermore, the contraction has already begun.

823
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:56,660
Never mind all the details.

824
00:57:56,660 --> 00:57:59,330
So what's going to happen?

825
00:57:59,330 --> 00:58:01,120
Who knows...?

826
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:04,240
But two worlds that must stay apart are going to collide.

827
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:07,530
If we are lucky only one will be destroyed .

828
00:58:07,530 --> 00:58:09,450
Perhaps, both worlds will be destroyed.

829
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:12,240
How much time do we have?

830
00:58:12,830 --> 00:58:16,120
l don't have enough data, so l can't say with certainty...

831
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:18,520
But l'd guess... about one hour.

832
00:58:19,410 --> 00:58:22,700
l'll mobilize the Punishment Force and enter the Valley of Screams immediately!

833
00:58:22,700 --> 00:58:24,120
lt's useless.

834
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:29,410
There is no Senkaimon that connects the Soul Society to this place,

835
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,410
therefore we have no way to enter.

836
00:58:32,410 --> 00:58:34,530
Any effort will be for naught.

837
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:38,620
The situation is critical!

838
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:40,120
Prepare the Kido Cannon!

839
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:45,830
We must destroy the Valley of Screams and the entire dimension connected to it.

840
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:50,410
But if we do that, it will cause massive damage to the both worlds!

841
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,560
There is no other choice.

842
00:58:56,530 --> 00:58:58,490
<i>No! Please stand back!</i>

843
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:07,240
What is the meaning of this?! This is a captains' meeting!

844
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:08,120
Be gone!

845
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:10,910
My deepest apologies, sir!

846
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:14,410
l will gladly accept any punishment later.

847
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:18,530
However, l have crucial information to report!

848
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:22,990
Substitute Shinigami Kurosaki Ichigo, has discovered an entryway to the Valley of Screams...

849
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:27,180
and has gone there in order to rescue Senna the Shinenju!

850
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:29,530
lchigo...

851
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,990
Please send reinforcements to assist Kurosaki Ichigo!

852
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:36,200
Well... but...

853
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:40,330
l cannot allow that.

854
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:41,990
Why is that?

855
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,530
Mind you, l am not taking the Substitute Shinigami's skills lightly...

856
00:59:46,530 --> 00:59:49,200
However, we have only one hour,

857
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:52,870
and there is no guarantee that the Thirteen Court Guard Squads

858
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:58,390
could defeat the enemy and rescue the Shinenju in that time.

859
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,780
Do not think poorly of me.

860
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,200
This meeting is now over.

861
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,660
All Squads will begin emergency procedures.

862
01:00:05,660 --> 01:00:07,740
Prepare the Kido Cannon!

863
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,700
l'm...

864
01:00:46,330 --> 01:00:47,700
l'm...

865
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,490
going, too!

866
01:00:49,490 --> 01:00:52,200
l'm not about to let him take all the glory.

867
01:01:14,990 --> 01:01:18,660
Ganryu-sama, the Blanks have latched onto the Shinenju.

868
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:20,620
Yes.

869
01:01:28,530 --> 01:01:29,990
Humph! A small fry...

870
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:34,240
Senna!

871
01:01:35,330 --> 01:01:36,740
l'm coming!

872
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:51,660
Have you returned for another beating?

873
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,490
Give Senna back!

874
01:01:59,890 --> 01:02:03,990
Just when we were trying to awaken her as Shinenju...

875
01:02:04,740 --> 01:02:06,740
Because of you,

876
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:09,370
she will now suffer pain and fear as a human being.

877
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,450
lchigo...

878
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,620
What?!

879
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:18,580
No... no!

880
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,740
Senna!

881
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:25,580
Nooo!

882
01:02:26,080 --> 01:02:28,780
You bastards–! Get outta my way!

883
01:02:47,410 --> 01:02:51,410
Maybe we should all go after Kurosaki-kun.

884
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:53,240
You better not.

885
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,780
The Valley of Screams is somewhat similar to the Soul Society...

886
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:59,490
lt's a spiritual world where humans cannot go.

887
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:07,870
Kuchiki-san?

888
01:03:08,530 --> 01:03:10,370
Abarai-kun?

889
01:03:10,910 --> 01:03:12,030
How was it?

890
01:03:13,120 --> 01:03:19,580
No good. Soul Society intends to use the Kido Cannon to destroy the entire Valley of Screams.

891
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,830
lf they do that, Kurosaki-kun will...

892
01:03:23,780 --> 01:03:25,490
l won't let that happen.

893
01:03:26,280 --> 01:03:30,660
Before they fire the Kido Cannon, we'll go and finish the job.

894
01:03:31,330 --> 01:03:32,950
But...

895
01:03:32,950 --> 01:03:34,620
Don't worry.

896
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:36,490
We'll figure something out.

897
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:39,160
You wouldn't stand a chance alone.

898
01:03:40,830 --> 01:03:43,580
We've already put the team together.

899
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,990
We'll settle this ourselves!

900
01:03:45,990 --> 01:03:47,490
l'm coming, too!

901
01:03:48,490 --> 01:03:50,870
There's no time. Let's go!

902
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,200
Yes, sir!

903
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:54,200
Yes, sir!

904
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:57,370
Kuchiki-san... please take care of Kurosaki-kun.

905
01:03:58,410 --> 01:03:59,530
l know.

906
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,530
Let go!

907
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:36,580
Damn!

908
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:48,280
Kenpachi!

909
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:49,740
lt's dangerous, over there.

910
01:04:56,740 --> 01:04:57,740
You too...!

911
01:05:01,950 --> 01:05:03,490
What was that?

912
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,870
What's taking you so long?!

913
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,620
You guys!

914
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,780
You're not getting away with this... coming all by yourself!

915
01:05:20,780 --> 01:05:24,410
Thought we'd join in for some fun.

916
01:05:25,450 --> 01:05:28,700
Look how many people volunteered to the call.

917
01:05:28,700 --> 01:05:30,870
Leave this side to us!

918
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:33,780
Now go, Kurosaki!

919
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:36,700
l'm counting on you guys!

920
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:39,830
Let's do it!

921
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:40,530
Right!

922
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,660
Grow! Hozukimaru!

923
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,740
Growl! Haineko!

924
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:07,450
Raise Your Head!

925
01:06:07,450 --> 01:06:08,830
Wabisuke!

926
01:06:18,950 --> 01:06:20,950
Take that! You pesky brat!

927
01:06:31,030 --> 01:06:32,580
What's going on?!

928
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:33,780
Hey!

929
01:06:36,330 --> 01:06:38,120
ls this what you're looking for?

930
01:06:39,990 --> 01:06:40,990
Why you–!

931
01:06:59,530 --> 01:07:00,330
You little–!

932
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:16,490
lt's too late! There!

933
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:41,100
Ridiculous...

934
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:44,410
What?!

935
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:49,740
but l'm not bad at it!

936
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:48,680
l don't like playing tag,

937
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:56,280
Go, Ken-chan!

938
01:07:57,830 --> 01:07:59,660
Can l cut you already?

939
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:08,660
You might just turn out to be some fun, after all.

940
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:33,450
Sit Upon the Frozen Heavens!

941
01:08:33,450 --> 01:08:34,950
Hyorinmaru!

942
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,990
Hanging in there, huh, kid?

943
01:08:47,990 --> 01:08:51,450
Let's see who'll last longer, shall we?

944
01:08:52,160 --> 01:08:55,740
Well, l don't mind if this keeps up forever.

945
01:08:55,740 --> 01:08:56,780
Take this!

946
01:09:29,330 --> 01:09:31,120
Looks like it's over–

947
01:09:39,870 --> 01:09:41,120
Bankai!

948
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,490
Daiguren Hyorinmaru!

949
01:09:45,740 --> 01:09:47,910
Dammit! l can't believe he still has that kind of power left!

950
01:09:49,910 --> 01:09:50,910
What's going on?!

951
01:09:51,410 --> 01:09:52,330
What?!

952
01:10:09,950 --> 01:10:13,370
Third chant complete. We are ready to fire.

953
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:19,950
The target will pass out of critical range in five minutes.

954
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:25,410
Head Captain!

955
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:26,740
l understand.

956
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:29,700
l will wait until the very last second.

957
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,700
However...

958
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:43,160
l said l won't let you get to the Shinenju!

959
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:48,490
lchigo, grab on!

960
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:01,780
Renji!

961
01:11:02,330 --> 01:11:03,740
Go! lchigo!

962
01:11:06,910 --> 01:11:07,830
What?!

963
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,410
You're not going anywhere!

964
01:11:15,620 --> 01:11:18,780
Then we'll finish you two first!

965
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:30,200
What?!

966
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:46,370
Senna!

967
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:51,700
You still believe you can save the Shinenju?

968
01:11:51,700 --> 01:11:54,780
Damn right! l'm gonna save Senna!

969
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:02,490
lt's too late!

970
01:12:03,080 --> 01:12:07,350
The Shinenju has already begun to merge with the Valley of Screams.

971
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,740
No one can stop it now.

972
01:12:10,740 --> 01:12:12,490
Shaddup!

973
01:12:12,490 --> 01:12:15,910
You just wait, Senna! l'll get you outta here real soon!

974
01:12:16,410 --> 01:12:19,120
You still don't seem to understand.

975
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,080
How useless it is.

976
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,240
Getsuga Tensho!

977
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:30,560
Why you–!

978
01:12:31,330 --> 01:12:33,370
So you finally showed yourself!

979
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:37,310
l'll beat you and save Senna!

980
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:39,870
Go ahead, bring it on!

981
01:12:40,330 --> 01:12:41,370
Let's go!

982
01:12:41,370 --> 01:12:43,700
Ban...kai!

983
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,030
Tensa Zangetsu!

984
01:13:40,950 --> 01:13:49,530
For a millennium, our clan was forced to nest in the crevices of the Dangai Precipice World in disgrace.

985
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:54,120
We were able to endure that suffering until this day...

986
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,030
because of our hatred...

987
01:13:56,030 --> 01:14:00,120
our desire to destroy Soul Society!

988
01:14:00,120 --> 01:14:03,950
And that moment is about to happen!

989
01:14:04,410 --> 01:14:06,240
l will not let you interfere!

990
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:19,450
Why are you so determined?

991
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:22,830
The Shinenju is just a collective of memories.

992
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,240
The mere remains of what used to be alive.

993
01:14:26,950 --> 01:14:29,240
That's not true!

994
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:33,080
Senna is here and she's alive!

995
01:14:39,410 --> 01:14:43,240
She was confused and afraid, looking for help...

996
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:45,740
l'm going to protect her...

997
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:51,120
l swore it on my soul!

998
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,370
<i>l get it now...</i>

999
01:15:13,370 --> 01:15:16,580
<i>All of you are just...</i>

1000
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:20,080
lchigo!

1001
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,910
We pass out of critical range in two minutes!

1002
01:15:32,410 --> 01:15:35,280
No word yet? What are they doing?!

1003
01:15:36,830 --> 01:15:39,700
l can wait no longer!

1004
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:41,390
Sensei!

1005
01:15:43,990 --> 01:15:46,200
Fire the Kido Cannon!

1006
01:16:14,180 --> 01:16:15,240
Captain!

1007
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:18,160
The cannon's been fired! The entire dimension will collapse!

1008
01:16:25,870 --> 01:16:26,700
What?!

1009
01:16:31,120 --> 01:16:34,120
My zanpakuto is pretty tough.

1010
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:37,490
That kind of attack won't change a thing!

1011
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:50,830
You're not getting away!

1012
01:16:51,330 --> 01:16:52,910
There's no need to run away!

1013
01:16:52,910 --> 01:16:54,580
You impudent–!

1014
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:57,660
Dance! Sode no Shirayuki!

1015
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,530
lt's useless!

1016
01:17:02,200 --> 01:17:03,330
Some no mai.

1017
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:06,780
Tsukishiro!

1018
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:32,200
What?!

1019
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:35,490
Like l said, it's useless!

1020
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:36,120
Take this!

1021
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:44,870
Nii-sama!

1022
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:49,830
Be honored...

1023
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:52,490
that you will perish by my Bankai.

1024
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:56,370
Scatter! Senbonzakura Kageyoshi.

1025
01:18:03,370 --> 01:18:05,120
Nii-sama!

1026
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,200
Let's go.

1027
01:18:10,990 --> 01:18:12,200
Senna!

1028
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:38,100
Here l come!

1029
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,120
Come on!

1030
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:19,830
Hey, you're awfully quiet.

1031
01:19:20,410 --> 01:19:22,120
What's the matter, cat got your tongue?

1032
01:19:28,780 --> 01:19:30,080
Shut up.

1033
01:19:39,620 --> 01:19:41,080
They're coming back.

1034
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:10,450
Shinenju has been successfully retrieved!

1035
01:20:10,450 --> 01:20:12,240
The Valley of Screams is disintegrating!

1036
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:42,620
Welcome home!

1037
01:20:42,620 --> 01:20:44,280
Nee-san!

1038
01:20:44,950 --> 01:20:46,620
Kurosaki, you did it!

1039
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,620
Well done. You did it!

1040
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:51,370
Quite impressive.

1041
01:20:51,990 --> 01:20:54,280
l'm so glad everyone is all right.

1042
01:20:54,910 --> 01:20:57,780
Thanks! Rukia! Renji!

1043
01:20:57,780 --> 01:21:01,200
Stupid! We didn't do it for you.

1044
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,330
l must admit, not bad for the freeloader.

1045
01:21:04,330 --> 01:21:05,390
What?!

1046
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:07,780
You can stay and eat.

1047
01:21:07,780 --> 01:21:10,280
Senna! l forgot, your ribbon...

1048
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:14,410
lchigo.

1049
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:26,080
What is it? Why won't the alarm stop?

1050
01:21:28,660 --> 01:21:32,330
lt's no good! The dimension passed beyond the critical zone!

1051
01:21:32,330 --> 01:21:36,240
World of the Living and Soul Society are together on a collision course!

1052
01:21:36,990 --> 01:21:38,180
At this rate...!

1053
01:21:42,950 --> 01:21:43,990
What's going on?!

1054
01:21:45,030 --> 01:21:47,240
lt's not stopping?!

1055
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,530
Then what'll happen?

1056
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,780
This is not good.

1057
01:21:52,330 --> 01:21:53,030
Wait!

1058
01:21:58,330 --> 01:21:59,990
Why?!

1059
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:05,740
This is bad.

1060
01:22:05,740 --> 01:22:08,120
Damn! ls it too late?

1061
01:22:26,870 --> 01:22:29,370
lchigo... l'm scared.

1062
01:22:30,530 --> 01:22:31,700
Senna?

1063
01:22:32,330 --> 01:22:34,660
But... but...

1064
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:39,620
l won't let it happen. Not when it's such a wonderful world.

1065
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:43,780
Not when... so many people live in it.

1066
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:46,160
Not when...

1067
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,530
You live here, lchigo...!

1068
01:22:56,080 --> 01:23:00,120
lt's okay. The Blanks are still near me.

1069
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:04,490
lf l release their energy all at once,

1070
01:23:04,490 --> 01:23:07,580
the two worlds can probably be returned to normal.

1071
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,560
Senna?!

1072
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,450
lf there's no world, you'll be gone, too...

1073
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,370
l don't want that.

1074
01:23:25,830 --> 01:23:27,780
Stop! You still have...

1075
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:33,200
l don't want you to die instead of me!

1076
01:23:36,370 --> 01:23:37,120
Senna...

1077
01:23:37,990 --> 01:23:39,370
Senna!

1078
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:50,330
Explosions in the Dangai Precipice World have been confirmed!

1079
01:23:50,330 --> 01:23:55,200
Both worlds are moving towards their respective stable positions.

1080
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,410
The collision has been averted!

1081
01:23:59,830 --> 01:24:03,030
lchigo, l have a favor to ask.

1082
01:24:41,660 --> 01:24:44,990
l want you to check... my family grave...

1083
01:24:46,620 --> 01:24:50,030
Remember yesterday, l told you it was here?

1084
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:56,780
l was alive once... and l lived in this town...

1085
01:24:56,780 --> 01:24:58,200
So...

1086
01:24:58,200 --> 01:24:59,520
Yeah.

1087
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:05,530
l must've had a family, too.

1088
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,950
l... existed.

1089
01:25:11,330 --> 01:25:14,740
So there should be a name on the grave...

1090
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:20,080
Was it around here?

1091
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,520
The fourth one from the end.

1092
01:25:30,410 --> 01:25:32,410
ls there... a name?

1093
01:25:33,780 --> 01:25:37,430
I don't know why, but my vision is blurred...

1094
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:45,950
ls it there?

1095
01:25:48,370 --> 01:25:50,280
Yeah, it's here.

1096
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,830
You did live in this town.

1097
01:25:56,830 --> 01:25:58,490
And you had a family, too.

1098
01:26:04,990 --> 01:26:06,240
l'm glad...

1099
01:26:15,990 --> 01:26:17,080
lt feels so warm.

1100
01:26:19,490 --> 01:26:23,450
We'll... meet again, won't we?

1101
01:26:23,450 --> 01:26:26,910
What're you saying? Of course...

1102
01:27:02,620 --> 01:27:05,620
The energy of the Blanks will soon be depleted...

1103
01:27:07,370 --> 01:27:10,030
And everything about Senna...

1104
01:27:10,030 --> 01:27:13,580
will fade from our memories.

1105
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:17,950
Memories of those that never existed can't possibly remain...

1106
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:29,770
l know she'll be gone soon, but right now, l can still hear her voice.

1107
01:27:43,530 --> 01:27:46,830
l want to be loved, but don't try to love,

1108
01:27:46,830 --> 01:27:50,580
repeating and wandering through

1109
01:27:50,580 --> 01:27:54,620
The single answer l've found is

1110
01:27:54,620 --> 01:28:00,990
no matter how scared, or hurt l become,

1111
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:04,990
l tell the person l love, "l love you"

1112
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:30,620
l don't care

1113
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:33,830
Whether you "do love me, or do not love me"

1114
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:36,030
No matter how hard you wish

1115
01:28:36,030 --> 01:28:40,580
ln this world, there are way too many things that cannot be changed,

1116
01:28:40,580 --> 01:28:43,280
And the fact

1117
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:46,740
That l love you

1118
01:28:46,740 --> 01:28:49,990
ls the truth that cannot be changed by anyone

1119
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:58,490
Crossing over a thousand nights, l want to tell you

1120
01:28:58,490 --> 01:29:03,080
l have to tell you

1121
01:29:03,080 --> 01:29:05,830
l want to be loved, but don't try to love,

1122
01:29:05,830 --> 01:29:09,200
Repeating and wandering

1123
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:13,660
The single answer l've found is

1124
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:19,580
No matter how scared, or hurt l become,

1125
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:23,910
l tell the person l love, "l love you"

1126
01:29:24,580 --> 01:29:30,580
lt is scary to put feelings into words,

1127
01:29:30,580 --> 01:29:35,490
but l'll tell the person l love, "l love you"

1128
01:29:46,490 --> 01:29:49,950
There is no way to express in words,

1129
01:29:49,950 --> 01:29:52,780
The joy of coming across each other in this vast world

1130
01:29:52,780 --> 01:29:55,830
That is why we smile,

1131
01:29:55,830 --> 01:30:00,200
singing the passing colorful autumn in sol-fa,

1132
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:03,910
Facing back against the winter, waiting for the spring sunlight

1133
01:30:03,910 --> 01:30:08,830
ln order to be reborn so that we can protect someone

1134
01:30:09,490 --> 01:30:14,830
The path l came, and the path l go, whenever l turn back

1135
01:30:14,830 --> 01:30:19,330
l had cowardly eyes

1136
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:22,120
l want to face it, but cannot be honest about it

1137
01:30:22,120 --> 01:30:25,490
Repeating over the days of

1138
01:30:25,490 --> 01:30:32,740
not being able to love the person

1139
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:35,950
But hating to be by myself,

1140
01:30:35,950 --> 01:30:40,330
l tried to love someone without getting hurt

1141
01:31:06,620 --> 01:31:08,740
Crossing over a thousand nights,

1142
01:31:08,740 --> 01:31:11,990
l shall go to you now,

1143
01:31:11,990 --> 01:31:16,580
There is something l must tell you

1144
01:31:16,580 --> 01:31:19,160
l want to be loved, but don't try to love,

1145
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:22,740
Repeating and wandering

1146
01:31:22,740 --> 01:31:27,160
The single answer l've found is

1147
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:33,120
no matter how scared, or hurt l become,

1148
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:37,240
l tell the person l love, "l love you"

1149
01:31:37,950 --> 01:31:43,990
Even if that feeling is denied,

1150
01:31:43,990 --> 01:31:46,450
Telling the person l love...

1151
01:31:46,450 --> 01:31:51,030
ls the most wonderful thing in this world.

1152
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:01,270
Wow, what strong wind!

1153
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:21,870
Oh shut up. Who cares about that, it's the same either way!

1154
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,990
No, we'll get scolded!

1155
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:25,740
Yeah yeah, l'm out!

1156
01:32:26,330 --> 01:32:28,780
Hey wait!
