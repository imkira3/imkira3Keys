1
00:00:05,738 --> 00:00:10,639


2
00:01:14,303 --> 00:01:15,827
Are you the guys from Washington?

3
00:01:15,938 --> 00:01:17,735
You get many other visitors out here?

4
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,398
How long you been on-site?

5
00:01:19,508 --> 00:01:20,873
Since this morning.

6
00:01:20,976 --> 00:01:23,604
A Russian oil team
called it in about 18 hours ago.

7
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:26,212
How come nobody spotted it before?

8
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,010
It's really not that surprising.

9
00:01:28,484 --> 00:01:30,611
This landscape's changing all the time.

10
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,550
You got any idea
what this thing is exactly?

11
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:34,713
I don't know.
It's probably a weather balloon.

12
00:01:34,823 --> 00:01:36,154
I don't think so.

13
00:01:36,258 --> 00:01:38,283
You know, we don't have
the equipment for a job like this.

14
00:01:38,627 --> 00:01:41,027
How long before
we can start craning it out?

15
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,025
I don't think you quite understand.

16
00:01:43,398 --> 00:01:46,060
You guys are gonna need
one hell of a crane.

17
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:34,582
<i>Base, we're in.</i>

18
00:02:40,689 --> 00:02:41,986
<i>What is this?</i>

19
00:02:57,306 --> 00:02:58,432
<i>Careful.</i>

20
00:03:19,328 --> 00:03:20,625
<i>Lieutenant!</i>

21
00:03:23,732 --> 00:03:25,029
<i>What is it?</i>

22
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,697
<i>My God.</i>

23
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,470
<i>Base, get me a line to the Colonel.</i>

24
00:03:30,205 --> 00:03:31,638
<i>It's 3:00 a.m., sir.</i>

25
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,302
<i>I don't care what time it is.
This one's waited long enough.</i>

26
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,239
Open it!

27
00:04:51,153 --> 00:04:52,711
Quickly, before he...

28
00:05:04,766 --> 00:05:08,566
It has taken me a long time
to find this place.

29
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,835
You should be commended.

30
00:05:12,941 --> 00:05:13,930
Help him up.

31
00:05:18,447 --> 00:05:21,848
I think that you are
a man of great vision.

32
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,380
And, in this way, we are much alike.

33
00:05:24,486 --> 00:05:25,919
I am nothing like you.

34
00:05:26,021 --> 00:05:27,545
No, of course, but

35
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:33,183
what others see as superstition,
you and I know to be a science.

36
00:05:33,762 --> 00:05:35,559
What you seek is just a legend.

37
00:05:35,664 --> 00:05:38,189
Then why make such an effort
to conceal it?

38
00:05:58,587 --> 00:06:03,388
The Tesseract was the jewel
of Odin's treasure room.

39
00:06:08,463 --> 00:06:11,091
It is not something one buries.

40
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,894
But I think it is close, yes?

41
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,968
I cannot help you.

42
00:06:18,273 --> 00:06:22,676
No. But maybe
you can help your village.

43
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:28,038
You must have some friends out there.
Some little grandchildren, perhaps?

44
00:06:28,784 --> 00:06:31,150
I have no need for them to die.

45
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,891
Yggdrasil.

46
00:06:47,702 --> 00:06:50,170
Tree of the world.

47
00:06:52,007 --> 00:06:54,134
Guardian of wisdom.

48
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,079
And fate, also.

49
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:33,707
<i>And the Führer digs for trinkets
in the desert.</i>

50
00:07:37,152 --> 00:07:40,121
You have never seen this, have you?

51
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:44,184
It's not for the eyes of ordinary men.

52
00:07:44,426 --> 00:07:45,893
Exactly.

53
00:07:49,264 --> 00:07:51,391
Give the order to open fire.

54
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,765
Fool!

55
00:07:54,402 --> 00:07:56,700
You cannot control the power you hold.

56
00:07:56,805 --> 00:07:57,829
You will burn!

57
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,669
I already have.

58
00:08:13,121 --> 00:08:15,089
<i>O'Connell, Michael.</i>

59
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:17,949
Kaminsky, Henry.

60
00:08:18,293 --> 00:08:20,284
Boy, a lot of guys
getting killed over there.

61
00:08:20,595 --> 00:08:22,222
Rogers, Steven.

62
00:08:23,298 --> 00:08:26,096
It kind of makes you think twice
about enlisting, huh?

63
00:08:26,635 --> 00:08:27,761
Nope.

64
00:08:30,739 --> 00:08:32,206
Rogers.

65
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,040
- What did your father die of?
- Mustard gas.

66
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:45,080
He was in the 107th Infantry.
I was hoping I could be assigned...

67
00:08:45,186 --> 00:08:47,882
- Your mother?
- She was a nurse in a TB ward.

68
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:50,080
Got hit. Couldn't shake it.

69
00:08:54,663 --> 00:08:56,688
- Sorry, son.
- Look, just give me a chance.

70
00:08:56,798 --> 00:08:59,358
You'd be ineligible
on your asthma alone.

71
00:08:59,834 --> 00:09:00,858
Is there anything you can do?

72
00:09:01,369 --> 00:09:02,666
I'm doing it.

73
00:09:03,104 --> 00:09:04,366
I'm saving your life.

74
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:10,878
<i>War continues to ravage Europe.</i>

75
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,881
<i>But help is on the way.</i>

76
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:19,279

78
00:09:25,026 --> 00:09:26,994
<i>collecting scrap metal.</i>

79
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:28,217
<i>Nice work, Timmy!</i>

80
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,592
Who cares?

81
00:09:30,765 --> 00:09:32,357
Play the movie already!

82
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,162
Hey, you wanna show some respect?

83
00:09:34,436 --> 00:09:35,630
<i>Meanwhile, overseas,</i>

84
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,797
<i>our brave boys are showing

85
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:40,636
<i>of freedom is never too high.</i>

86
00:09:40,742 --> 00:09:43,040
Let's go! Get on with it!

87
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:45,708
Hey, just start the cartoon!

88
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:46,940
Hey, you wanna shut up?

89
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:50,510
<i>Together with Allied forces,
we'll face any threat,</i>

90
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:51,949
<i>no matter the size.</i>

91
00:10:09,404 --> 00:10:11,167
You just don't know when to give up,
do you?

92
00:10:11,906 --> 00:10:13,703
I can do this all day.

93
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,341
Hey!

94
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:20,914
Pick on someone your own size.

95
00:10:29,157 --> 00:10:32,126
Sometimes I think
you like getting punched.

96
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:34,454
I had him on the ropes.

97
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,695
How many times is this?

98
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:40,059
You're from Paramus now?

99
00:10:40,335 --> 00:10:43,065
You know it's illegal to lie
on the enlistment form.

100
00:10:43,171 --> 00:10:44,638
And seriously, Jersey?

101
00:10:46,474 --> 00:10:47,873
You get your orders?

102
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:51,536
The 107th.

103
00:10:51,946 --> 00:10:53,345
Sergeant James Barnes,

104
00:10:53,448 --> 00:10:55,814
shipping out for England
first thing tomorrow.

105
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,812
I should be going.

106
00:11:04,426 --> 00:11:05,415
Come on, man.

107
00:11:06,194 --> 00:11:09,095
My last night!
I got to get you cleaned up.

108
00:11:09,197 --> 00:11:10,721
Why? Where are we going?

109
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,162
The future.

110
00:11:17,038 --> 00:11:19,063
I don't see what the problem is.

111
00:11:19,174 --> 00:11:21,768
You're about to be
the last eligible man in New York.

112
00:11:22,043 --> 00:11:24,375
You know there's
three and a half million women here?

113
00:11:24,479 --> 00:11:25,707
Well, I'd settle for just one.

114
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:28,147
Good thing I took care of that.

115
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:29,841
Hey, Bucky!

116
00:11:32,187 --> 00:11:34,246
What'd you tell her about me?

117
00:11:34,489 --> 00:11:36,320
Only the good stuff.

118
00:11:37,525 --> 00:11:40,585

Hey, Steve, what do you say
we treat these girls...

133
00:13:16,457 --> 00:13:18,254
Come on, soldier.

134
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:25,325
Come on. You're kind of
missing the point of a double date.

135
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:26,900
We're taking the girls dancing.

136
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,026
You go ahead. I'll catch up with you.

137
00:13:32,006 --> 00:13:33,997
You're really going to do this again?

138
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,598
Well, it's a fair. I'm gonna try my luck.

139
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:37,405
As who, Steve from Ohio?

140
00:13:37,512 --> 00:13:39,844
They'll catch you.
Or worse, they'll actually take you.

141
00:13:40,548 --> 00:13:41,845
Look, I know
you don't think I can do this.

142
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:43,315
This isn't a back alley, Steve. It's war.

143
00:13:43,618 --> 00:13:45,381
- I know it's a war.
- Why are you so keen to fight?

144
00:13:45,486 --> 00:13:47,317
- There are so many important jobs.
- What do you want me to do?

145
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:49,356
Collect scrap metal
in my little red wagon?

146
00:13:49,457 --> 00:13:51,049
- Yes. Why not?
- I'm not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.

147
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,719
Bucky, come on.
There are men laying down their lives.

148
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,856
I got no right to do any less than them.

149
00:13:56,965 --> 00:13:59,593
That's what you don't understand.
This isn't about me.

150
00:14:00,068 --> 00:14:03,162
Right. 'Cause you got nothing to prove.

151
00:14:06,074 --> 00:14:08,907
Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?

152
00:14:10,178 --> 00:14:11,941
Yes, we are.

153
00:14:17,785 --> 00:14:20,015
Don't do anything stupid until I get back.

154
00:14:20,121 --> 00:14:21,145
How can I?

155
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:23,454
You're taking all the stupid with you.

156
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,788
- You're a punk.
- Jerk.

157

Be careful.

158
00:14:34,636 --> 00:14:36,160
Don't win the war till I get there!

159
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:44,210
Come on, girls.
They're playing our song.

160
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:04,993
Wait here.

161
00:15:06,034 --> 00:15:08,434
- Is there a problem?
- Just wait here.

162
00:15:27,388 --> 00:15:28,685
Thank you.

163
00:15:32,527 --> 00:15:33,585
So,

164
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:37,765
you want to go overseas.
Kill some Nazis.

165
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:40,430
Excuse me?

166
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:42,394
Dr. Abraham Erskine.

167
00:15:42,503 --> 00:15:45,199
I represent
the Strategic Scientific Reserve.

168
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,632
Steve Rogers.

169
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,703
Where are you from?

170
00:15:53,147 --> 00:15:57,277
Queens. 73rd Street
and Utopia Parkway.

171
00:15:57,752 --> 00:15:59,720
Before that, Germany.

172
00:16:00,755 --> 00:16:02,620
- This troubles you?
- No.

173
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:05,751
Where are you from, Mr. Rogers?

174
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:07,789
Is it New Haven?

175
00:16:08,896 --> 00:16:10,295
Or Paramus?

176
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:13,562
Five exams in five different cities.

177
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:14,692
That might not be the right file.

178
00:16:14,802 --> 00:16:16,633
No, it's not the exams I'm interested in.

179
00:16:16,738 --> 00:16:18,865
It's the five tries.

180
00:16:19,941 --> 00:16:24,071
But you didn't answer my question.
Do you want to kill Nazis?

181
00:16:27,048 --> 00:16:28,037
Is this a test?

182
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,747
Yes.

183
00:16:33,855 --> 00:16:35,482
I don't want to kill anyone.

184
00:16:36,257 --> 00:16:39,351
I don't like bullies.
I don't care where they're from.

185
00:16:41,129 --> 00:16:42,357
Well, there are already

186
00:16:42,463 --> 00:16:44,397
so many big men fighting this war.

187
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:46,462
Maybe what we need now is a little guy.

188
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,303
I can offer you a chance.

189
00:16:51,706 --> 00:16:53,571
Only a chance.

190
00:16:53,674 --> 00:16:55,403
- I'll take it.
- Good.

191
00:16:56,644 --> 00:17:00,444
So where is
the little guy from? Actually?

192
00:17:01,482 --> 00:17:02,779
Brooklyn.

193
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:07,420
Congratulations, soldier.

194
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,706
Are you ready, Dr. Zola?

195
00:17:35,183 --> 00:17:38,812
My machine requires
the most delicate calibration.

196
00:17:40,421 --> 00:17:42,412
Forgive me if I seem overcautious.

197
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,117
Are you certain
that those conductors of yours

198
00:17:45,226 --> 00:17:49,287
can withstand the energy surge
long enough for transference?

199
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,963
With this artifact

200
00:17:51,632 --> 00:17:52,963
I am certain of nothing.

201
00:17:53,267 --> 00:17:55,633
I fear it may not work at all.

202
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:33,967
Twenty percent.

203
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,541
Forty.

204
00:18:40,248 --> 00:18:41,579
Sixty.

205
00:18:44,452 --> 00:18:46,283
Stabilizing at 70%.

206
00:18:48,489 --> 00:18:52,118
I have not come all this way
for safety, Doctor.

207
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:12,236
What was that?

208
00:19:12,847 --> 00:19:15,941
I must congratulate you, Arnim.

209
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:19,213
Your designs do not disappoint.

210
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,620
Though they may require
some slight reinforcement.

211
00:19:24,392 --> 00:19:26,622
The exchange is stable.

212
00:19:27,194 --> 00:19:28,661
Amazing!

213
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:31,355
The energy we have just collected

214
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:34,400
could power my designs.
All my designs.

215
00:19:36,571 --> 00:19:39,369
This will change the war.

216
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,836
Dr. Zola,

217
00:19:43,244 --> 00:19:46,179
this will change the world.

218
00:19:48,716 --> 00:19:50,581
Ready, exercise!

219
00:19:50,685 --> 00:19:52,448
Recruits, attention!

220
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:54,978
Gentlemen, I am Agent Carter.

221
00:19:55,356 --> 00:19:57,950
I supervise all operations
for this division.

222
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,190
What's with the accent, Queen Victoria?

223
00:20:01,395 --> 00:20:03,386
I thought I was signing up
for the U.S. Army.

224
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:04,622
What's your name, soldier?

225
00:20:05,066 --> 00:20:06,727
Gilmore Hodge, Your Majesty.

226
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,529
Step forward, Hodge.

227
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:11,669
Put your right foot forward.

228
00:20:13,107 --> 00:20:14,438
We gonna wrassle?

229
00:20:16,277 --> 00:20:18,643
'Cause I got a few moves
I know you'll like.

230
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:22,777
Agent Carter!

231
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,515
Colonel Phillips.

232
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:27,588
I can see that you are
breaking in the candidates. That's good!

233
00:20:28,322 --> 00:20:29,584
Get your ass up out of that dirt

234
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:32,420
and stand in that line at attention till
somebody comes tells you what to do.

235
00:20:32,526 --> 00:20:33,959
Yes, sir!

236
00:20:37,298 --> 00:20:39,596
General Patton has said

237
00:20:40,167 --> 00:20:43,796
that wars are fought with weapons,
but they are won by men.

238
00:20:43,904 --> 00:20:47,431
We are going to win this war
because we have the best men.

239
00:20:51,846 --> 00:20:54,007
And because they are
going to get better.

240
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:56,083
Much better.

241
00:20:56,917 --> 00:21:00,648
<i>The Strategic Scientific Reserve
is an Allied effort</i>

242
00:21:00,788 --> 00:21:03,780
<i>made up of
the best minds in the free world.</i>

243
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,385
<i>Our goal is
to create the best army in history.</i>

244
00:21:07,962 --> 00:21:09,827
<i>But every army starts with one man.</i>

245
00:21:10,264 --> 00:21:12,061
Rogers! Get off of there!

246
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,259
<i>At the end of this week,
we will choose that man.</i>

247
00:21:14,835 --> 00:21:18,464
He will be the first
in a new breed of super-soldier.

248
00:21:24,745 --> 00:21:27,111
Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!

249
00:21:27,214 --> 00:21:31,844
And they will personally escort
Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell.

250
00:21:32,186 --> 00:21:34,313
Pick up the pace, ladies!

251
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:38,447
Let's go, let's go! Double time!

252
00:21:38,793 --> 00:21:41,591
Come on! Faster! Faster!

253
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:44,361
Move! Move!

254
00:21:44,732 --> 00:21:46,700
Squad, halt!

255
00:21:47,368 --> 00:21:49,598
That flag means
we're only at the halfway point.

256
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:53,738
First man to bring it to me
gets a ride back with Agent Carter.

257
00:21:53,841 --> 00:21:55,536
Move, move!

258
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,307
Come on! Get up there!

259
00:21:58,579 --> 00:22:01,275
If that's all you got,
this army's in trouble!

260
00:22:01,382 --> 00:22:02,940
Get up there, Hodge!

261
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:05,582
Come on! Get up there!

262
00:22:07,254 --> 00:22:09,688
Nobody's got that flag in 17 years!

263
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:14,653
Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in!

264
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,026
Let's go! Get back into formation!

265
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,762
Rogers! I said fall in!

266
00:22:38,052 --> 00:22:39,576
Thank you, sir.

267
00:22:48,395 --> 00:22:50,590
Faster, ladies! Come on.

268
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:53,196
My grandmother has more life in her,
God rest her soul.

269
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:55,657
Move it!

270
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,897
You're not really thinking
about picking Rogers, are you?

271
00:22:58,005 --> 00:23:00,906
I'm more than just thinking about it.
He is the clear choice.

272
00:23:01,008 --> 00:23:04,307
When you brought a 90-pound
asthmatic onto my army base,

273
00:23:04,411 --> 00:23:05,810
I let it slide. I thought, "What the hell."

274
00:23:05,913 --> 00:23:07,608
Maybe he'd be useful to you,
like a gerbil.

275
00:23:07,715 --> 00:23:08,739
I never thought you'd pick him.

276
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:10,009
Up.

277
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,852
You stick a needle in that kid's arm,
it's gonna go right through him.

278
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,423
- Come on, girls.
- Look at that.

279
00:23:18,392 --> 00:23:19,757
He's making me cry.

280
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,420
I am looking for qualities
beyond the physical.

281
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:25,124
Do you know how long it took
to set up this project?

282
00:23:25,232 --> 00:23:26,324
All the groveling I had to do

283
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:27,593
in front of Senator
What's-His-Name's committees?

284
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,896
Brandt. Yes, I know.
I am well aware of your efforts.

285
00:23:30,004 --> 00:23:33,235
Then throw me a bone.
Hodge passed every test we gave him.

286
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:35,240
He's big, he's fast. He obeys orders.

287
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:36,775
- He's a soldier.
- He is a bully.

288
00:23:37,044 --> 00:23:39,774
You don't win wars
with niceness, Doctor.

289
00:23:43,117 --> 00:23:45,915
You win wars with guts.

290
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:49,215
Grenade!

291
00:23:53,761 --> 00:23:55,058
Get away!

292
00:23:55,596 --> 00:23:56,961
Get back!

293
00:24:04,271 --> 00:24:05,795
It was a dummy grenade.

294
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:08,898
All clear. Back in formation.

295
00:24:13,214 --> 00:24:14,272
Is this a test?

296
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,176
He's still skinny.

297
00:24:25,726 --> 00:24:27,387
- May I?
- Yeah.

298
00:24:30,731 --> 00:24:32,028
Can't sleep?

299
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,497
I got the jitters, I guess.

300
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:36,366
Me, too.

301
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,696
Can I ask you a question?

302
00:24:39,807 --> 00:24:41,172
Just one?

303
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,809
Why me?

304
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:50,646
I suppose that is
the only question that matters.

305
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:56,823
This is from Augsburg. My city.

306
00:24:59,526 --> 00:25:00,550
So many people forget

307
00:25:00,661 --> 00:25:03,129
that the first country the Nazis invaded
was their own.

308
00:25:03,864 --> 00:25:07,265
You know, after the last war,
my people struggled.

309
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:10,269
They felt weak. They felt small.

310
00:25:10,371 --> 00:25:12,100
And then Hitler comes along
with the marching

311
00:25:12,206 --> 00:25:15,198
and the big show and the flags.

312
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:20,536
And he hears of me. My work.
And he finds me.

313
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:21,945
And he says, "You."

314
00:25:22,883 --> 00:25:24,646
He says, "You will make us strong."

315
00:25:25,419 --> 00:25:28,047
Well, I am not interested.

316
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:31,822
So he sends the head of Hydra,

317
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:34,261
his research division.

318
00:25:34,561 --> 00:25:37,189
A brilliant scientist by the name
of Johann Schmidt.

319
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,898
Now, Schmidt is
a member of the inner circle.

320
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,297
And he is ambitious.

321
00:25:41,735 --> 00:25:47,002
<i>He and Hitler share a passion for
occult power and Teutonic myth.</i>

322
00:25:47,775 --> 00:25:50,767
Hitler uses his fantasies
to inspire his followers.

323
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:52,641
But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy.

324
00:25:53,147 --> 00:25:56,139
For him, it is real.
He has become convinced

325
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,775
that there is a great power
hidden in the earth,

326
00:25:58,886 --> 00:26:00,114
<i>left here by the gods,</i>

327
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,018
waiting to be seized by a superior man.

328
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:08,618
So when he hears about my formula
and what it can do, he cannot resist.

329
00:26:11,665 --> 00:26:14,225
<i>Schmidt must become
that superior man.</i>

330
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,032
Did it make him stronger?

331
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,503
Yes.

332
00:26:22,943 --> 00:26:25,844
But there were other effects.

333
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:31,443
The serum was not ready.

334
00:26:32,686 --> 00:26:35,655
But more important, the man.

335
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:38,887
The serum amplifies
everything that is inside,

336
00:26:38,993 --> 00:26:42,121
so good becomes great.

337
00:26:42,229 --> 00:26:43,924
Bad becomes worse.

338
00:26:49,236 --> 00:26:50,828
This is why you were chosen.

339
00:26:51,972 --> 00:26:55,499
Because a strong man
who has known power all his life

340
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:57,543
may lose respect for that power,

341
00:26:57,644 --> 00:27:00,807
but a weak man knows
the value of strength.

342
00:27:01,315 --> 00:27:03,180
And knows

343
00:27:03,717 --> 00:27:05,014
compassion.

344
00:27:08,222 --> 00:27:10,952
Thanks. I think.

345
00:27:16,897 --> 00:27:19,798
Whatever happens tomorrow,
you must promise me one thing.

346
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:25,096
That you will stay who you are.

347
00:27:27,641 --> 00:27:29,609
Not a perfect soldier,

348
00:27:29,977 --> 00:27:30,966
but

349
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:33,446
a good man.

350
00:27:38,652 --> 00:27:40,119
To the little guys.

351
00:27:42,756 --> 00:27:44,189
No, no. Wait, wait. What I am doing?

352
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:46,418
No, you have procedure tomorrow.
No fluids.

353
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:49,525
All right. We'll drink it after.

354
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:53,197
No, I don't have procedure tomorrow.
Drink it after? I drink it now.

355
00:28:08,749 --> 00:28:11,582
Is there something in particular
you need?

356
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:20,256
I understand you found him.

357
00:28:21,095 --> 00:28:22,722
See for yourself.

358
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:36,365
You disapprove.

359
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:40,103
I just don't see
why you need concern yourself.

360
00:28:40,214 --> 00:28:41,943
I can't imagine he will succeed.

361
00:28:44,985 --> 00:28:46,179
Again.

362
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:50,580
His serum is the Allies' only defense
against this power we now possess.

363
00:28:50,691 --> 00:28:54,286
If we take it away from them,
then our victory is assured.

364
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:59,125
Shall I give the order?

365
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:02,134
It has been given.

366
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:05,635
Good.

367
00:29:08,308 --> 00:29:09,275
Dr. Zola!

368
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,877
What do you think?

369
00:29:21,755 --> 00:29:23,655
A masterpiece.

370
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:35,662
I know this neighborhood.

371
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,565
I got beat up in that alley.

372
00:29:40,207 --> 00:29:41,231
And that parking lot.

373
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:45,444
And behind that diner.

374
00:29:45,946 --> 00:29:48,346
Did you have something against
running away?

375
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:53,518
You start running,
they'll never let you stop.

376
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,679
You stand up, you push back.

377
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:57,086
They can't say no forever, right?

378
00:29:57,891 --> 00:30:01,349
I know a little of what that's like,
to have every door shut in your face.

379
00:30:02,729 --> 00:30:04,629
I guess I just don't know
why you'd want to join the Army

380
00:30:04,731 --> 00:30:06,096
if you were a beautiful dame.

381
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,733
Or a... A woman.

382
00:30:07,935 --> 00:30:09,232
An agent. Not a dame.

383
00:30:09,636 --> 00:30:11,160
You are beautiful, but...

384
00:30:11,972 --> 00:30:14,167
You have no idea
how to talk to a woman, do you?

385
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:16,709
I think this is the longest conversation
I've had with one.

386
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:21,705
Women aren't exactly lining up
to dance with a guy they might step on.

387
00:30:22,115 --> 00:30:23,412
You must have danced.

388
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:26,179
Well, asking a woman to dance
always seemed so terrifying.

389
00:30:27,254 --> 00:30:29,245
And the past few years, it just

390
00:30:29,356 --> 00:30:32,223
didn't seem to matter that much.
I figured I'd wait.

391
00:30:32,593 --> 00:30:33,787
For what?

392
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:36,828
The right partner.

393
00:30:51,378 --> 00:30:52,777
This way.

394
00:30:56,049 --> 00:30:58,415
- What are we doing here?
- Follow me.

395
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:14,460
Wonderful weather this morning,
isn't it?

396
00:31:14,568 --> 00:31:16,798
Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.

397
00:32:14,461 --> 00:32:15,951
Good morning.

398
00:32:17,197 --> 00:32:18,824
Please, not now.

399
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,796
Are you ready?

400
00:32:26,873 --> 00:32:30,434
Good. Take off your shirt, your tie,
and your hat.

401
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:37,776
Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.

402
00:32:37,884 --> 00:32:39,476
Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?

403
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:41,451
We needed access to
the city's power grid.

404
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:43,682
Of course, if you'd given me
the generators I requisitioned...

405
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:45,951
A lot of people are
asking for funds, Colonel.

406
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:47,458
This is...

407
00:32:47,561 --> 00:32:49,222
Fred Clemson, State Department.

408
00:32:49,329 --> 00:32:50,796
If this project of yours comes through,

409
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:53,525
we'd like to see it used
for something other than headlines.

410
00:32:53,633 --> 00:32:57,364
Jesus. Somebody get that kid
a sandwich.

411
00:33:10,384 --> 00:33:11,442
Comfortable?

412
00:33:13,553 --> 00:33:14,679
It's a little big.

413
00:33:17,023 --> 00:33:18,581
You save me any of that schnapps?

414
00:33:19,593 --> 00:33:22,460
Not as much as I should have. Sorry.

415
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:24,160
Next time.

416
00:33:25,232 --> 00:33:27,359
Mr. Stark, how are your levels?

417
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,697
- Levels at 100%.
- Good.

418
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:31,771
We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn,

419
00:33:32,239 --> 00:33:35,037
but we are ready as we'll ever be.

420
00:33:36,042 --> 00:33:37,066
Agent Carter?

421
00:33:37,177 --> 00:33:39,441
Don't you think you would be
more comfortable in the booth?

422
00:33:39,546 --> 00:33:41,138
- Yes, of course. Sorry.
- Good.

423
00:33:53,994 --> 00:33:55,359
<i>Do you hear me? Is this on?</i>

424
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:57,455
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

425
00:33:58,198 --> 00:34:01,634
<i>today we take not another step
towards annihilation,</i>

426
00:34:02,068 --> 00:34:03,262
<i>but the first step</i>

427
00:34:03,637 --> 00:34:05,662
<i>on the path to peace.</i>

428
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:11,068
<i>We begin with a series
of microinjections into</i>

429
00:34:11,178 --> 00:34:14,944
<i>the subject's major muscle groups.
The serum infusion</i>

430
00:34:15,315 --> 00:34:18,113
<i>will cause immediate cellular change.</i>

431
00:34:18,685 --> 00:34:21,654
<i>And then, to stimulate growth,</i>

432
00:34:21,855 --> 00:34:25,256
<i>the subject will be
saturated with Vita-Rays.</i>

433
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:34,091
That wasn't so bad.

434
00:34:34,768 --> 00:34:36,065
That was penicillin.

435
00:34:39,706 --> 00:34:41,901
Serum infusion beginning in

436
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:43,298
five,

437
00:34:44,377 --> 00:34:45,366
<i>four,</i>

438
00:34:46,813 --> 00:34:47,802
three,

439
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:50,739
two,

440
00:34:52,185 --> 00:34:53,174
one.

441
00:35:03,763 --> 00:35:05,094
Now, Mr. Stark.

442
00:35:28,522 --> 00:35:31,491
Steven? Can you hear me?

443
00:35:31,925 --> 00:35:35,053
It's probably too late
to go to the bathroom, right?

444
00:35:36,496 --> 00:35:38,191
We will proceed.

445
00:35:50,744 --> 00:35:51,733
That's 10%.

446
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:53,902
Twenty percent.

447
00:35:54,314 --> 00:35:55,440
Thirty.

448
00:35:58,084 --> 00:35:59,142
<i>That's 40%.</i>

449
00:36:00,654 --> 00:36:01,643
Vital signs are normal.

450
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:02,877
That's 50%.

451
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:04,679
Sixty.

452
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:07,655
Seventy.

453
00:36:12,265 --> 00:36:13,254
Steven!

454
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,800
- Steven!
- Shut it down!

455
00:36:17,137 --> 00:36:18,161
Shut it down!

456
00:36:18,872 --> 00:36:19,998
Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark!

457
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,798
Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!

458
00:36:21,908 --> 00:36:23,205
No!

459
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:26,203
Don't! I can do this!

460
00:36:33,153 --> 00:36:34,177
Eighty.

461
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:35,877
Ninety.

462
00:36:37,324 --> 00:36:39,258
That's 100%.

463
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,780
Mr. Stark?

464
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,560
Steven. Steven.

465
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:19,628
The son of a bitch did it.

466
00:37:26,106 --> 00:37:27,437
- I did it.
- Yeah, yeah.

467
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,266
I think we did it.

468
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:30,569
You actually did it.

469
00:37:34,547 --> 00:37:36,139
How do you feel?

470
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:40,576
Taller.

471
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:44,921
You look taller.

472
00:37:45,191 --> 00:37:46,818
How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?

473
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:51,128
I can think of some folks in Berlin
who are about to get very nervous.

474
00:37:53,667 --> 00:37:55,794
Congratulations, Doctor.

475
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:57,563
Thank you, sir.

476
00:38:08,815 --> 00:38:10,282
Stop him!

477
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,910
What are you doing?
Buddy, are you all right?

478
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:18,643
Hey, this guy's been shot!

479
00:39:29,896 --> 00:39:30,885
I had him!

480
00:39:31,564 --> 00:39:33,191
Sorry!

481
00:39:53,052 --> 00:39:54,417
I'm sorry!

482
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:09,554
No! No! Not my son!

483
00:41:10,496 --> 00:41:11,963
- Stop it!
- Don't hurt him!

484
00:41:13,967 --> 00:41:15,229
Get back!

485
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:17,734
Let me go!

486
00:41:20,807 --> 00:41:22,172
Let go of my son!

487
00:41:24,878 --> 00:41:26,140
Don't hurt him!

488
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:32,211
Wait, don't! Don't!

489
00:41:33,987 --> 00:41:35,011
No! Don't!

490
00:41:41,094 --> 00:41:43,062
Go get him! I can swim!

491
00:42:35,381 --> 00:42:37,576
- Who the hell are you?
- The first of many.

492
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,680
Cut off one head,

493
00:42:41,688 --> 00:42:43,553
two more shall take its place.

494
00:42:45,992 --> 00:42:47,857
Hail Hydra.

495
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,708
<i>The Führer is not accustomed
to being ignored, Herr Schmidt.</i>

496
00:43:09,816 --> 00:43:12,717
He funds your research because
you promised him weapons.

497
00:43:12,819 --> 00:43:14,719
You serve at his pleasure.

498
00:43:14,821 --> 00:43:17,688
He gave you this facility
as a reward for your injuries.

499
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:20,281
Reward? Call it what it is. Exile.

500
00:43:20,426 --> 00:43:23,054
I no longer reflect his image
of Aryan perfection.

501
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:25,562
You think this is about appearances?

502
00:43:25,665 --> 00:43:30,068
Your Hydra division has failed to deliver
so much as a rifle in over a year.

503
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:32,569
And we had learned
through local intelligence

504
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:35,732
you had mounted a full-scale incursion
into Norway.

505
00:43:35,842 --> 00:43:37,742
<i>The Führer feels... How does he put it?</i>

506
00:43:37,844 --> 00:43:41,075
"The Red Skull has been indulged
long enough!"

507
00:43:53,126 --> 00:43:54,593
Gentlemen,

508
00:43:57,196 --> 00:44:00,654
you have come to see
the results of our work.

509
00:44:01,968 --> 00:44:03,265
Let me show you.

510
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:07,599
Hitler speaks of a 1,000-year Reich,

511
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:09,607
but he cannot feed his armies
for a month.

512
00:44:09,709 --> 00:44:13,042
His troops spill their blood
across every field in Europe,

513
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:17,173
but still he is no closer to
achieving his goals.

514
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,813
And I suppose you still aim
to win this war through magic?

515
00:44:21,554 --> 00:44:25,354
Science. But I understand
your confusion.

516
00:44:25,825 --> 00:44:28,623
Great power has always
baffled primitive men.

517
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:32,991
Hydra is assembling an arsenal
to destroy my enemies in one stroke,

518
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:36,531
wherever they are, regardless of
how many forces they possess,

519
00:44:36,636 --> 00:44:37,728
all in a matter of hours.

520
00:44:38,071 --> 00:44:39,368
Your enemies?

521
00:44:39,472 --> 00:44:42,100
My weapons contain
enough destructive power

522
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:44,836
to decimate
every hostile capital on Earth.

523
00:44:47,346 --> 00:44:48,973
Quite simply, gentlemen,

524
00:44:49,916 --> 00:44:52,407
I have harnessed the power of the gods.

525
00:44:54,454 --> 00:44:55,512
Thank you, Schmidt.

526
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,588
For what?

527
00:44:57,056 --> 00:45:00,287
For making it clear
how obviously mad you are.

528
00:45:00,393 --> 00:45:01,792
Berlin is on this map!

529
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,252
So it is.

530
00:45:06,365 --> 00:45:08,959
You will be punished for your insolence!

531
00:45:09,068 --> 00:45:11,593
<i>You will be brought
before the Führer himself!</i>

532
00:45:20,813 --> 00:45:22,781
Schmidt...

533
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:29,687
My apologies, Doctor,

534
00:45:29,789 --> 00:45:34,749
but we both knew Hydra could grow
no further in Hitler's shadow.

535
00:45:36,129 --> 00:45:37,153
Hail Hydra.

536
00:45:37,964 --> 00:45:39,659
Hail Hydra!

537
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,999
Hail Hydra!

538
00:45:57,650 --> 00:45:59,242
Think you got enough?

539
00:46:00,786 --> 00:46:04,916
Any hope of reproducing the program
is locked in your genetic code.

540
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:08,186
But without Dr. Erskine,
it would take years.

541
00:46:09,529 --> 00:46:11,224
He deserved more than this.

542
00:46:12,632 --> 00:46:16,090
If it could work only once,
he'd be proud it was you.

543
00:46:19,005 --> 00:46:21,906
Colonel Phillips,
my committee is demanding answers.

544
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:23,832
Great. Why don't we start with how

545
00:46:23,943 --> 00:46:27,106
a German spy got a ride to
my secret installation in your car?

546
00:46:27,213 --> 00:46:28,703
What have we got here?

547
00:46:28,814 --> 00:46:31,840
Speaking modestly, I'm the best
mechanical engineer in this country.

548
00:46:32,185 --> 00:46:34,847
But I don't know what's inside this thing
or how it works.

549
00:46:35,321 --> 00:46:36,788
We're not even close to this technology.

550
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:38,516
- Then who is?
- Hydra.

551
00:46:39,158 --> 00:46:40,523
I'm sure you've been
reading our briefings.

552
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:43,051
I'm on a number of
committees, Colonel.

553
00:46:43,162 --> 00:46:45,357
Hydra is the Nazi deep-science division.

554
00:46:45,464 --> 00:46:49,059
It's led by Johann Schmidt.
But he has much bigger ambitions.

555
00:46:49,168 --> 00:46:50,362
Hydra is practically a cult.

556
00:46:50,469 --> 00:46:52,061
They worship Schmidt.
They think he's invincible.

557
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:53,732
So, what are you going to do about it?

558
00:46:54,807 --> 00:46:56,035
I spoke to the President this morning.

559
00:46:56,542 --> 00:46:59,568
- As of today, the SSR is being retasked.
- Colonel?

560
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:02,978
We are taking the fight to Hydra.
Pack your bags, Agent Carter.

561
00:47:03,082 --> 00:47:04,379
You, too, Stark.

562
00:47:04,784 --> 00:47:06,411
We're flying to London tonight.

563
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,817
Sir? If you're going after Schmidt,
I want in.

564
00:47:09,121 --> 00:47:11,089
You're an experiment.
You're going to Alamogordo.

565
00:47:11,691 --> 00:47:12,749
The serum worked.

566
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:14,655
I asked for an army
and all I got was you.

567
00:47:15,261 --> 00:47:17,855
You are not enough.

568
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:23,331
With all due respect to the Colonel,

569
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:25,800
I think we may be missing the point.

570
00:47:26,172 --> 00:47:30,472
I've seen you in action, Steve.
More importantly, the country's seen it.

571
00:47:30,843 --> 00:47:31,810
Paper.

572
00:47:32,778 --> 00:47:34,473
The enlistment lines
have been around the block

573
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,411
since your picture hit the newsstands.

574
00:47:37,283 --> 00:47:40,377
You don't take a soldier,
a symbol like that,

575
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,415
and hide him in a lab.

576
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:46,891
Son, do you want to serve your country

577
00:47:46,993 --> 00:47:49,962
on the most important battlefield
of the war?

578
00:47:51,264 --> 00:47:53,255
Sir, that's all I want.

579
00:47:53,866 --> 00:47:57,267
Then, congratulations.
You just got promoted.

580
00:48:00,406 --> 00:48:01,600
I don't know if I can do this.

581
00:48:01,707 --> 00:48:06,337
Nothing to it. You sell a few bonds.
Bonds buy bullets. Bullets kill Nazis.

582
00:48:06,746 --> 00:48:08,270
You're an American hero.

583
00:48:08,514 --> 00:48:10,675
It's just not how I pictured getting there.

584
00:48:11,317 --> 00:48:13,376
The Senator has got
a lot of pull up on the Hill.

585
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:14,612
You play ball with us,

586
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,654
you'll be leading your own platoon
in no time.

587
00:48:16,756 --> 00:48:18,246
Take the shield.

588
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:20,650
Go.

589
00:48:22,028 --> 00:48:26,658
<i>Who's strong and brave
Here to save the American way?</i>

590
00:48:27,933 --> 00:48:30,663
Not all of us can storm a beach
or drive a tank.

591
00:48:30,770 --> 00:48:32,465
But there's still a way all of us can fight.

592
00:48:32,571 --> 00:48:37,235
<i>Who vows to fight like a man
For what's right, night and day?</i>

593
00:48:37,643 --> 00:48:39,235
Series E Defense Bonds.

594
00:48:39,345 --> 00:48:43,042
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

595
00:48:43,182 --> 00:48:46,640
<i>Who will campaign door-to-door
for America?</i>

596
00:48:46,752 --> 00:48:50,017
<i>Carry the flag shore to shore
for America?</i>

597
00:48:50,122 --> 00:48:53,182
<i>From Hoboken to Spokane</i>

598
00:48:53,292 --> 00:48:59,288
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

599
00:49:01,667 --> 00:49:04,397
Cut. Guys, don't look at the camera.

600
00:49:04,537 --> 00:49:08,530
<i>We can't ignore there's a threat
and a war we must win</i>

601
00:49:08,641 --> 00:49:11,439
Each one you buy is a bullet in
the barrel of your best guy's gun.

602
00:49:11,544 --> 00:49:17,005
<i>Who'll hang a noose on the
goose-stepping goons from Berlin?</i>

603
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:21,783
<i>Who will redeem
Heed the call for America?</i>

604
00:49:22,021 --> 00:49:25,081
<i>Who'll rise or fall
Give his all for America?</i>

605
00:49:25,658 --> 00:49:28,491
<i>Who's here to prove that we can?</i>

606
00:49:28,594 --> 00:49:34,658
<i>The star-spangled man with a plan</i>

607
00:49:35,134 --> 00:49:37,432
We all know this is about
trying to win the war.

608
00:49:37,536 --> 00:49:40,699
We can't do that without bullets
and bandages, tanks and tents.

609
00:49:40,806 --> 00:49:43,001
That's where you come in.
Every bond you buy

610
00:49:43,109 --> 00:49:44,337
will help protect someone you love.

611
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:47,310
- Turn around! He's right behind you!
- Keep our boys armed and ready,

612
00:49:47,413 --> 00:49:50,143
and the Germans will think twice about
trying to get the drop on us.

613
00:49:54,053 --> 00:49:59,753
<i>Stalwart and steady and true</i>

621
00:50:22,415 --> 00:50:25,782
<i>Who waked the giant

623
00:50:30,055 --> 00:50:31,022
Hi.

<i>Who'll finish what they began?</i>

<i>How many of you are ready to
help me sock old Adolf on the jaw?</i>

629
00:51:02,888 --> 00:51:04,014
<i>Okay.</i>

630
00:51:07,593 --> 00:51:08,992
<i>I need a volunteer.</i>

631
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:11,289
I already volunteered!
How do you think I got here?

632
00:51:12,798 --> 00:51:14,823
Bring back the girls!

633
00:51:18,871 --> 00:51:21,169
<i>I think they only know the one song, but</i>

634
00:51:21,907 --> 00:51:23,374
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

635
00:51:23,709 --> 00:51:25,370
You do that, sweetheart.

636
00:51:25,878 --> 00:51:28,506
Nice boots, Tinker Bell!

637
00:51:29,582 --> 00:51:31,948
<i>Come on, guys,
we're all on the same team here.</i>

638
00:51:32,151 --> 00:51:34,312
Hey, Captain! Sign this!

639
00:51:45,164 --> 00:51:47,029
Bring back the girls!

640
00:51:51,670 --> 00:51:54,298
Don't worry, pal. They'll warm up to you.
Don't worry.

641
00:52:02,681 --> 00:52:04,046
Hello, Steve.

642
00:52:05,417 --> 00:52:06,543
Hi.

643
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,815
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

644
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:12,117
Officially, I'm not here at all.

645
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,491
That was quite a performance.

646
00:52:14,894 --> 00:52:15,861
Yeah.

647
00:52:17,096 --> 00:52:18,723
I had to improvise a little bit.

648
00:52:19,098 --> 00:52:21,566
The crowds I'm used to
are usually more

649
00:52:23,168 --> 00:52:24,135
twelve.

650
00:52:24,236 --> 00:52:26,170
I understand you're
"America's New Hope."

651
00:52:26,272 --> 00:52:28,832
Bond sales take a 10% bump
in every state I visit.

652
00:52:28,941 --> 00:52:30,465
Is that Senator Brandt I hear?

653
00:52:32,111 --> 00:52:34,170
At least he's got me doing this.

654
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,804
Phillips would have had me
stuck in a lab.

655
00:52:36,115 --> 00:52:38,583
And these are your only two options?

656
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:41,249
A lab rat or a dancing monkey?

657
00:52:41,954 --> 00:52:44,582
You were meant for more than this,
you know.

658
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:51,486
What?

659
00:52:52,865 --> 00:52:55,698
You know, for the longest time,
I dreamed about

660
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:59,601
coming overseas
and being on the front lines,

661
00:52:59,972 --> 00:53:01,439
serving my country.

662
00:53:02,308 --> 00:53:04,276
I finally got everything I wanted

663
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:08,837
and I'm wearing tights.

664
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:18,956
They look like they've been through hell.

665
00:53:19,792 --> 00:53:20,986
These men more than most.

666
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:29,790
Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano.
Two hundred men went up against him,

667
00:53:30,669 --> 00:53:32,796
and less than 50 returned.

668
00:53:33,706 --> 00:53:36,106
Your audience contained
what was left of the 107th.

669
00:53:37,009 --> 00:53:38,874
The rest were killed or captured.

670
00:53:39,078 --> 00:53:40,670
The 107th?

671
00:53:40,779 --> 00:53:41,746
What?

672
00:53:42,214 --> 00:53:43,545
Come on.

673
00:53:44,650 --> 00:53:45,617
Colonel Phillips.

674
00:53:45,718 --> 00:53:47,549
Well, if it isn't
the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan.

675
00:53:47,653 --> 00:53:48,915
What's your plan today?

676
00:53:49,088 --> 00:53:50,248
I need the casualty list from Azzano.

677
00:53:50,356 --> 00:53:51,653
You don't get to give me orders, son.

678
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:54,885
I just need one name,
Sergeant James Barnes from the 107th.

679
00:53:55,494 --> 00:53:57,985
You and I are gonna have a
conversation later that you won't enjoy.

680
00:53:58,097 --> 00:54:01,191
- Please tell me if he's alive, sir. B-A-R...
- I can spell.

681
00:54:07,239 --> 00:54:11,699
I have signed more of these condolence
letters today than I would care to count.

682
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,103
But the name does sound familiar.

683
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:15,737
I'm sorry.

684
00:54:19,952 --> 00:54:22,386
What about the others?
Are you planning a rescue mission?

685
00:54:22,721 --> 00:54:24,018
Yes, it's called "winning the war."

686
00:54:25,557 --> 00:54:27,047
But if you know where they are,
why not at least...

687
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,888
They're 30 miles behind the lines

688
00:54:29,028 --> 00:54:31,792
through some of the most
heavily fortified territory in Europe.

689
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:33,364
We'd lose more men than we'd save.

690
00:54:33,465 --> 00:54:36,127
But I don't expect you to understand that
because you're a chorus girl.

691
00:54:38,404 --> 00:54:39,803
I think I understand just fine.

692
00:54:40,339 --> 00:54:41,966
Well, then understand it
somewhere else.

693
00:54:42,307 --> 00:54:46,505
If I read the posters correctly,
you got someplace to be in 30 minutes.

694
00:54:51,383 --> 00:54:54,011
Yes, sir. I do.

695
00:54:58,123 --> 00:55:03,117
If you have something to say, right now
is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.

696
00:55:06,365 --> 00:55:08,230
What do you plan to do, walk to Austria?

697
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:09,732
If that's what it takes.

698
00:55:09,835 --> 00:55:11,928
You heard the Colonel.
Your friend is most likely dead.

699
00:55:12,037 --> 00:55:13,004
You don't know that.

700
00:55:13,105 --> 00:55:15,073
Even so, he's devising a strategy.
If he detects...

701
00:55:15,174 --> 00:55:17,972
By the time he's done that,
it could be too late.

702
00:55:18,077 --> 00:55:19,101
Steve!

703
00:55:25,584 --> 00:55:29,680
You told me you thought I was meant
for more than this. Did you mean that?

704
00:55:31,390 --> 00:55:32,687
Every word.

705
00:55:34,426 --> 00:55:35,415
Then you got to let me go.

706
00:55:39,031 --> 00:55:40,828
I can do more than that.

707
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:44,202
On stage, girls. Five minutes!

708
00:55:45,704 --> 00:55:46,966
Where's my helmet?

709
00:55:47,072 --> 00:55:48,471
Anyone seen Rogers?

710
00:55:52,411 --> 00:55:54,379
<i>The Hydra camp is in Krausberg,</i>

711
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:56,471
tucked between
these two mountain ranges.

712
00:55:56,582 --> 00:55:57,640
It's a factory of some kind.

713
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,980
We should be able to
drop you right on the doorstep.

714
00:56:00,085 --> 00:56:01,780
Just get me as close as you can.

715
00:56:01,887 --> 00:56:03,548
You two are gonna be
in a lot of trouble when you land.

716
00:56:03,655 --> 00:56:04,622
And you won't?

717
00:56:04,723 --> 00:56:07,191
Where I'm going, if anybody yells at me,
I can just shoot them.

718
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:08,919
They will undoubtedly shoot back.

719
00:56:09,027 --> 00:56:10,995
Well, let's hope it's good for something.

720
00:56:11,096 --> 00:56:12,120
Agent Carter?

721
00:56:12,231 --> 00:56:13,528
If we're not in too much of a hurry,

722
00:56:13,632 --> 00:56:17,159
I thought we could stop off in Lucerne
for a late-night fondue.

723
00:56:22,441 --> 00:56:25,239
Stark is the best civilian pilot
I've ever seen.

724
00:56:25,511 --> 00:56:27,979
He's mad enough to brave this airspace.
We're lucky to have him.

725
00:56:29,748 --> 00:56:31,511
So, are you two... Do you...

726
00:56:33,952 --> 00:56:35,078
...fondue?

727
00:56:36,288 --> 00:56:38,449
This is your transponder.
Activate it when you're ready

728
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:40,990
and the signal will lead us
straight to you.

729
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,959
Are you sure this thing works?

730
00:56:44,062 --> 00:56:46,326
It's been tested more than you, pal.

731
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,995
Get back here!
We're taking you all the way in!

732
00:56:55,808 --> 00:56:58,777
As soon as I'm clear, you turn this thing
around and get the hell out of here!

733
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:01,012
You can't give me orders!

734
00:57:01,313 --> 00:57:03,941
The hell I can't! I'm a Captain!

735
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:26,604
<i>As you can see, production of
the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule,</i>

736
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:29,003
even with components of this size.

737
00:57:29,341 --> 00:57:32,037
Increase the output by 60%

738
00:57:32,344 --> 00:57:35,973
and see to it our other facilities
do the same.

739
00:57:36,515 --> 00:57:40,815
But these prisoners,
I'm not sure they have the strength.

740
00:57:41,186 --> 00:57:44,155
Then use up what strength
they have left, Doctor.

741
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,488
There are always more workers.

742
00:57:49,528 --> 00:57:50,654
Not now!

743
00:58:06,044 --> 00:58:07,841
You know, Fritz,

744
00:58:08,881 --> 00:58:11,179
one of these days,
I'm gonna have a stick of my own.

745
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:45,442
Fellas.

746
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:48,336
Who are you supposed to be?

747
01:00:48,707 --> 01:00:51,972
I'm Captain America.

748
01:00:53,245 --> 01:00:54,678
I beg your pardon?

749
01:00:58,116 --> 01:00:59,913
What, are we taking everybody?

750
01:01:00,285 --> 01:01:01,843
I'm from Fresno, Ace.

751
01:01:02,054 --> 01:01:04,784
Is there anybody else? I'm looking
for a Sergeant James Barnes.

752
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:08,092
There's an isolation ward in the factory,
but no one's ever come back from it.

753
01:01:08,193 --> 01:01:09,285
All right.

754
01:01:09,394 --> 01:01:11,419
The tree line is northwest,
80 yards past the gate.

755
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,725
Get out fast and give 'em hell.

756
01:01:13,832 --> 01:01:15,527
I'll meet you guys in the clearing
with anybody else I find.

757
01:01:15,634 --> 01:01:18,159
Wait. You know what you're doing?

758
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:21,103
Yeah. I've knocked out Adolf Hitler
over 200 times.

759
01:01:46,131 --> 01:01:47,860
You know how to use that thing?

760
01:01:51,870 --> 01:01:52,837
Okay.

761
01:01:55,173 --> 01:01:56,640
What is happening?

762
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,918
Hey. Not exactly a Buick.

763
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,354
<i>- That one. "Zündung."
- Zündung?</i>

764
01:02:11,289 --> 01:02:12,256
Get this thing going, Dugan!

765
01:02:12,357 --> 01:02:13,688
I didn't know you spoke German.

766
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:16,989
Three semesters at Howard,
switched to French, girls much cuter.

767
01:02:17,095 --> 01:02:18,062
Didn't ask for the resume.

768
01:02:30,842 --> 01:02:32,207
- On your left!
- Up top!

769
01:02:49,828 --> 01:02:52,126
No, no! What are you doing?

770
01:02:53,231 --> 01:02:56,200
Our forces are outmatched.

771
01:03:20,859 --> 01:03:23,555
Keep moving! Grab those grenades!

772
01:04:03,168 --> 01:04:06,160
Sergeant. Three-two-five-five-seven.

773
01:04:07,272 --> 01:04:08,239
Bucky?

774
01:04:09,374 --> 01:04:10,341
Oh, my God.

775
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,947
- Is that...
- It's me.

776
01:04:17,182 --> 01:04:19,013
- It's Steve.
- Steve?

777
01:04:19,117 --> 01:04:20,550
- Come on.
- Steve.

778
01:04:24,723 --> 01:04:25,849
I thought you were dead.

779
01:04:26,791 --> 01:04:28,156
I thought you were smaller.

780
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:37,125
Come on.

781
01:04:39,571 --> 01:04:42,369
- What happened to you?
- I joined the Army.

782
01:04:48,747 --> 01:04:50,806
- Did it hurt?
- A little.

783
01:04:51,249 --> 01:04:52,546
Is this permanent?

784
01:04:52,751 --> 01:04:53,809
So far.

785
01:05:23,848 --> 01:05:25,475
Captain America!

786
01:05:25,703 --> 01:05:27,330
How exciting!

787
01:05:27,872 --> 01:05:30,841
I am a great fan of your films!

788
01:05:32,543 --> 01:05:36,502
So, Dr. Erskine managed it after all.

789
01:05:36,881 --> 01:05:38,678
Not exactly an improvement,

790
01:05:38,783 --> 01:05:42,082
but still, impressive.

791
01:05:44,889 --> 01:05:46,356
You've got no idea.

792
01:05:49,460 --> 01:05:50,518
Haven't I?

793
01:06:06,210 --> 01:06:09,202
No matter what lies Erskine told you,

794
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:12,677
you see, I was his greatest success!

795
01:06:26,164 --> 01:06:27,961
You don't have one of those, do you?

796
01:06:28,266 --> 01:06:30,564
You are deluded, Captain.

797
01:06:31,269 --> 01:06:33,897
You pretend to be a simple soldier,

798
01:06:34,005 --> 01:06:36,405
but in reality, you are just afraid

799
01:06:36,507 --> 01:06:40,136
to admit that
we have left humanity behind.

800
01:06:41,946 --> 01:06:44,642
Unlike you, I embrace it proudly.

801
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:46,908
Without fear!

802
01:06:47,185 --> 01:06:48,482
Then how come you're running?

803
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:02,623
Come on, let's go. Up.

804
01:07:05,603 --> 01:07:07,935
Sir? Are we going to the roof?

805
01:07:11,476 --> 01:07:12,773
What about me?

806
01:07:13,010 --> 01:07:14,807
Where will I sit?

807
01:07:15,446 --> 01:07:17,141
Not a scratch, Doctor.

808
01:07:17,315 --> 01:07:18,782
Not a scratch.

809
01:07:51,849 --> 01:07:54,010
Let's go. One at a time.

810
01:08:22,713 --> 01:08:25,682
- Gotta be a rope or something!
- Just go! Get out of here!

811
01:08:25,783 --> 01:08:27,148
No! Not without you!

812
01:08:28,085 --> 01:08:29,382
Hell.

813
01:08:50,575 --> 01:08:53,908
Senator Brandt, I regret to report that

814
01:08:54,011 --> 01:08:58,812
Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing
behind enemy lines on the third.

815
01:08:58,916 --> 01:09:01,043
Aerial reconnaissance
has proven unfruitful.

816
01:09:01,152 --> 01:09:05,111
As a result,
I must declare Captain Rogers

817
01:09:05,990 --> 01:09:08,117
killed in action. Period.

818
01:09:12,163 --> 01:09:13,892
The last surveillance flight is back.

819
01:09:16,334 --> 01:09:18,302
No sign of activity.

820
01:09:19,103 --> 01:09:21,867
- Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

821
01:09:24,509 --> 01:09:25,635
I can't touch Stark.

822
01:09:25,776 --> 01:09:28,574
He's rich and he's the Army's
number one weapons contractor.

823
01:09:28,679 --> 01:09:30,169
You are neither one.

824
01:09:30,281 --> 01:09:32,749
With respect, sir,
I don't regret my actions.

825
01:09:32,850 --> 01:09:34,511
And I don't think
Captain Rogers did, either.

826
01:09:34,619 --> 01:09:37,417
What makes you think
I give a damn about your opinions?

827
01:09:37,522 --> 01:09:39,319
I took a chance with you, Agent Carter.

828
01:09:39,423 --> 01:09:42,984
And now America's golden boy
and a lot of other good men are dead

829
01:09:43,094 --> 01:09:44,061
'cause you had a crush.

830
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:46,493
It wasn't that. I had faith.

831
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:51,593
Well, I hope that's a big comfort to you
when they shut this division down.

832
01:09:54,138 --> 01:09:55,435
What the hell's going on out there?

833
01:10:38,382 --> 01:10:40,145
Look who it is!

834
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:09,438
Some of these men
need medical attention.

835
01:11:09,547 --> 01:11:11,447
- Medic, we got wounded.
- Right over here.

836
01:11:11,549 --> 01:11:14,109
I'd like to surrender myself
for disciplinary action.

837
01:11:15,553 --> 01:11:17,180
That won't be necessary.

838
01:11:21,058 --> 01:11:22,286
Yes, sir.

839
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:25,328
Faith, huh?

840
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:33,331
You're late.

841
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:38,869
Couldn't call my ride.

842
01:11:41,178 --> 01:11:42,611
Hey!

843
01:11:42,913 --> 01:11:44,540
Let's hear it for Captain America!

844
01:12:01,565 --> 01:12:04,864
<i>I am honored
to present this medal for valor</i>

845
01:12:05,002 --> 01:12:08,597
to my personal friend, Captain America!

846
01:12:11,242 --> 01:12:12,869
Captain America!

847
01:12:14,478 --> 01:12:16,446
Captain, that's your cue!

848
01:12:20,251 --> 01:12:22,276
I thought he'd be taller.

849
01:12:34,298 --> 01:12:37,358
The fifth one was here in Poland,
right near the Baltic.

850
01:12:37,468 --> 01:12:39,595
And the sixth one was

851
01:12:40,137 --> 01:12:45,097
about here, 30, 40 miles west
of the Maginot Line.

852
01:12:46,911 --> 01:12:48,776
I just got a quick look.

853
01:12:49,480 --> 01:12:51,448
Well, nobody's perfect.

854
01:12:54,752 --> 01:12:57,118
These are the weapon factories
we know about.

855
01:12:57,588 --> 01:12:59,419
Sergeant Barnes said
that Hydra shipped

856
01:12:59,523 --> 01:13:02,048
all the parts to another facility
that isn't on this map.

857
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:03,786
Agent Carter, coordinate with Ml6.

858
01:13:03,894 --> 01:13:06,556
I want every Allied eyeball
looking for that main Hydra base.

859
01:13:06,664 --> 01:13:07,688
What about us?

860
01:13:07,798 --> 01:13:10,562
We are going to set a fire
under Johann Schmidt's ass.

861
01:13:10,668 --> 01:13:12,636
What do you say, Rogers? It's your map.

862
01:13:12,737 --> 01:13:16,332
- You think you can wipe Hydra off it?
- Yes, sir. I'll need a team.

863
01:13:16,774 --> 01:13:18,799
We're already putting together
the best men.

864
01:13:19,176 --> 01:13:21,974
With all due respect, sir, so am I.

865
01:13:23,347 --> 01:13:24,712
So, let's get this straight.

866
01:13:24,815 --> 01:13:26,806
We barely got out of there alive,
and you want us to go back?

867
01:13:28,552 --> 01:13:29,780
Pretty much.

868
01:13:29,887 --> 01:13:32,185
Sounds rather fun, actually.

869
01:13:33,891 --> 01:13:34,858
I'm in.

870
01:13:47,538 --> 01:13:48,835
We're in.

871
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:53,037
Hell, I'll always fight.
But you got to do one thing for me.

872
01:13:53,144 --> 01:13:54,133
What's that?

873
01:13:56,313 --> 01:13:57,337
Open a tab.

874
01:14:01,218 --> 01:14:02,685
Well, that was easy.

875
01:14:03,053 --> 01:14:05,487
- Another round.
- Where are they putting all this stuff?

876
01:14:09,560 --> 01:14:11,687
See? I told you.

877
01:14:12,329 --> 01:14:14,297
They're all idiots.

878
01:14:14,899 --> 01:14:16,196
How about you?

879
01:14:17,001 --> 01:14:20,027
You ready to follow Captain America
into the jaws of death?

880
01:14:20,337 --> 01:14:21,463
Hell, no.

881
01:14:21,572 --> 01:14:26,032
That little guy from Brooklyn who was
too dumb not to run away from a fight.

882
01:14:27,244 --> 01:14:28,871
I'm following him.

883
01:14:32,416 --> 01:14:33,781
But you're keeping the outfit, right?

884
01:14:36,754 --> 01:14:37,880
You know what?

885
01:14:39,056 --> 01:14:40,182
It's kind of growing on me.

886
01:14:51,669 --> 01:14:53,068
- Captain.
- Agent Carter.

887
01:14:55,806 --> 01:14:56,773
Ma'am.

888
01:14:56,874 --> 01:14:59,843
Howard has some equipment for you
to try. Tomorrow morning?

889
01:14:59,944 --> 01:15:01,241
Sounds good.

890
01:15:05,950 --> 01:15:08,646
I see your top squad
is prepping for duty.

891
01:15:09,119 --> 01:15:10,086
You don't like music?

892
01:15:10,187 --> 01:15:11,552
I do, actually.

893
01:15:13,357 --> 01:15:16,815
I might even,
when this is all over, go dancing.

894
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:18,491
Then what are we waiting for?

895
01:15:19,463 --> 01:15:20,987
The right partner.

896
01:15:22,132 --> 01:15:23,429
0800, Captain.

897
01:15:24,635 --> 01:15:26,933
Yes, ma'am. I'll be there.

898
01:15:27,304 --> 01:15:28,828
I'm invisible.

899
01:15:29,373 --> 01:15:32,433
I'm turning into you.
It's like a horrible dream.

900
01:15:33,043 --> 01:15:36,103
Don't take it so hard.
Maybe she's got a friend.

901
01:15:37,815 --> 01:15:40,443
Emission signature is unusual.

902
01:15:40,985 --> 01:15:42,953
Alpha and beta ray neutral.

903
01:15:44,388 --> 01:15:46,788
Though I doubt
Rogers picked up on that.

904
01:15:48,492 --> 01:15:49,789
Seems harmless enough.

905
01:15:51,161 --> 01:15:53,026
Hard to see what all the fuss is about.

906
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:03,870
Write that down.

907
01:16:05,843 --> 01:16:08,539
Excuse me. I'm looking for Mr. Stark.

908
01:16:08,646 --> 01:16:10,705
He's in with Colonel Phillips.

909
01:16:15,519 --> 01:16:18,317
Of course, you're welcome to wait.

910
01:16:25,729 --> 01:16:27,060
I read about what you did.

911
01:16:27,431 --> 01:16:29,058
Oh, the... Yeah.

912
01:16:29,867 --> 01:16:31,391
Well, that's, you know.

913
01:16:33,037 --> 01:16:34,436
Just doing what needed to be done.

914
01:16:34,772 --> 01:16:37,605
Sounded like more than that.
You saved nearly 400 men.

915
01:16:43,948 --> 01:16:45,916
Really, it's not a big deal.

916
01:16:46,817 --> 01:16:48,944
Tell that to their wives.

917
01:16:52,323 --> 01:16:53,915
I don't think they were all married.

918
01:16:54,124 --> 01:16:55,682
You're a hero.

919
01:16:55,793 --> 01:16:58,284
Well, that depends
on the definition, really.

920
01:16:58,395 --> 01:17:01,694
The women of America,
they owe you their thanks.

921
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:05,835
And seeing as they're not here...

922
01:17:14,511 --> 01:17:15,500
Captain!

923
01:17:15,612 --> 01:17:18,240
We're ready for you,
if you're not otherwise occupied.

924
01:17:19,383 --> 01:17:20,850
Agent Carter, wait.

925
01:17:21,151 --> 01:17:23,278
Looks like finding a partner
wasn't that hard after all.

926
01:17:23,387 --> 01:17:24,979
Peggy, that's not
what you thought it was.

927
01:17:25,089 --> 01:17:27,683
I don't think anything, Captain,
not one thing.

928
01:17:27,992 --> 01:17:31,621
You always wanted to be a soldier,
and now you are, just like all the rest.

929
01:17:31,895 --> 01:17:32,987
Well, what about you and Stark?

930
01:17:33,097 --> 01:17:35,565
How do I know you two
haven't been fondue-ing?

931
01:17:40,504 --> 01:17:42,802
You still don't know
a bloody thing about women.

932
01:17:44,408 --> 01:17:46,399
<i>Fondue is just cheese and bread,
my friend.</i>

933
01:17:46,510 --> 01:17:49,308
- Really? I didn't think...
- Nor should you, pal.

934
01:17:49,413 --> 01:17:51,404
The moment you think you know
what's going on in a woman's head

935
01:17:51,515 --> 01:17:53,881
is the moment your goose
is well and truly cooked.

936
01:17:53,984 --> 01:17:56,646
Me, I concentrate on work,
which at the moment

937
01:17:56,754 --> 01:17:59,587
is about making sure you and your men
do not get killed.

938
01:17:59,857 --> 01:18:01,552
Carbon polymer.

939
01:18:02,226 --> 01:18:04,592
Should withstand
your average German bayonet.

940
01:18:04,695 --> 01:18:08,153
Although Hydra's not going to
attack you with a pocket knife.

941
01:18:08,532 --> 01:18:11,262
I hear you're kind of attached.

942
01:18:11,368 --> 01:18:12,767
It's handier than you might think.

943
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:14,997
I took the liberty
of coming up with some options.

944
01:18:15,706 --> 01:18:16,730
This one's fun.

945
01:18:17,574 --> 01:18:20,099
She's been fitted with electrical relays
that allow you to...

946
01:18:20,210 --> 01:18:21,768
- What about this one?
- No, no, that's just a prototype.

947
01:18:21,879 --> 01:18:24,006
- What's it made of?
- Vibranium.

948
01:18:25,115 --> 01:18:27,743
It's stronger than steel
and a third the weight.

949
01:18:28,385 --> 01:18:31,183
It's completely vibration absorbent.

950
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:34,748
How come it's not standard issue?

951
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:36,189
That's the rarest metal on Earth.

952
01:18:36,293 --> 01:18:37,954
What you're holding there,
that's all we've got.

953
01:18:38,062 --> 01:18:40,257
You quite finished, Mr. Stark?

954
01:18:40,364 --> 01:18:42,195
I'm sure the Captain
has some unfinished business.

955
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:44,199
What do you think?

956
01:18:54,078 --> 01:18:56,046
Yes, I think it works.

957
01:19:05,355 --> 01:19:07,482
I had some ideas about the uniform.

958
01:19:07,758 --> 01:19:09,248
Whatever you want, pal.

959
01:21:13,951 --> 01:21:16,283
You are failing!

960
01:21:17,187 --> 01:21:20,452
We are close to an offensive
that will shake the planet,

961
01:21:20,557 --> 01:21:22,491
yet we are continually delayed

962
01:21:22,593 --> 01:21:25,255
because you cannot outwit
a simpleton with a shield!

963
01:21:25,362 --> 01:21:27,330
This is hardly my area of expertise.

964
01:21:27,431 --> 01:21:31,128
I merely developed the weapons.
I cannot fire them.

965
01:21:32,436 --> 01:21:35,701
Finish your mission, Doctor,
before the American finishes his.

966
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:37,462
Sir!

967
01:21:39,776 --> 01:21:40,800
<i>I'm sorry, Herr Schmidt.</i>

968
01:21:42,379 --> 01:21:44,176
We fought to the last man.

969
01:21:47,484 --> 01:21:49,452
Evidently not.

970
01:22:01,665 --> 01:22:04,862
Remember when I made you ride
the Cyclone at Coney Island?

971
01:22:04,968 --> 01:22:06,595
Yeah, and I threw up?

972
01:22:07,938 --> 01:22:09,405
This isn't payback, is it?

973
01:22:09,506 --> 01:22:11,235
Now why would I do that?

974
01:22:11,341 --> 01:22:14,071
We were right. Dr. Zola's on the train.

975
01:22:14,177 --> 01:22:17,704
Hydra dispatcher gave him permission
to open up the throttle.

976
01:22:17,814 --> 01:22:19,714
Wherever he's going,
they must need him bad.

977
01:22:26,823 --> 01:22:29,189
Let's get going,
because they're moving like the devil.

978
01:22:29,826 --> 01:22:31,521
We only got about a 10-second window.

979
01:22:31,628 --> 01:22:34,188
You miss that window,
we're bugs on a windshield.

980
01:22:34,831 --> 01:22:35,798
Mind the gap.

981
01:22:35,899 --> 01:22:37,764
Better get moving, bugs!

982
01:23:45,602 --> 01:23:47,695
Stop him! Fire again!

983
01:24:40,323 --> 01:24:42,883
- I had him on the ropes.
- I know you did.

984
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:44,584
Get down!

985
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:48,161
Fire again!

986
01:24:48,932 --> 01:24:50,456
<i>Kill him! Now!</i>

987
01:24:57,741 --> 01:24:58,708
Bucky!

988
01:25:02,813 --> 01:25:04,246
Hang on!

989
01:25:05,982 --> 01:25:06,949
Grab my hand!

990
01:26:12,549 --> 01:26:13,846
Sit down.

991
01:26:20,323 --> 01:26:22,621
- What is this?
- Steak.

992
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:24,686
What is in it?

993
01:26:25,829 --> 01:26:27,126
Cow.

994
01:26:30,233 --> 01:26:33,225
Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is

995
01:26:33,336 --> 01:26:36,134
to get ahold of a prime cut like that
out here?

996
01:26:37,574 --> 01:26:38,973
I don't eat meat.

997
01:26:39,910 --> 01:26:41,036
Why not?

998
01:26:41,144 --> 01:26:42,805
It disagrees with me.

999
01:26:42,913 --> 01:26:45,814
How about cyanide? Does that give you
the rumbly tummy, too?

1000
01:26:48,752 --> 01:26:51,915
Every Hydra agent that
we've tried to take alive

1001
01:26:52,022 --> 01:26:56,823
has crunched a little pill before
we can stop him. But not you.

1002
01:26:57,861 --> 01:27:00,659
So, here is my brilliant theory.

1003
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:04,230
You want to live.

1004
01:27:05,602 --> 01:27:07,729
You're trying to intimidate me, Colonel.

1005
01:27:08,371 --> 01:27:09,963
I bought you dinner.

1006
01:27:15,211 --> 01:27:18,271
"Given the valuable information
he has provided

1007
01:27:19,049 --> 01:27:22,610
"and in exchange for
his full cooperation,

1008
01:27:23,053 --> 01:27:25,920
"Dr. Zola is being remanded
to Switzerland"?

1009
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:29,981
I sent that message to Washington
this morning, of course it was encoded.

1010
01:27:30,694 --> 01:27:34,289
You guys haven't broken those codes,
have you? That would be awkward.

1011
01:27:34,397 --> 01:27:36,365
Schmidt will know this is a lie.

1012
01:27:36,466 --> 01:27:40,027
He's going to kill you anyway, Doc.
You're a liability.

1013
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:42,438
You know more about Schmidt
than anyone.

1014
01:27:42,806 --> 01:27:47,937
And the last guy you cost us
was Captain Rogers' closest friend,

1015
01:27:48,044 --> 01:27:50,979
so I wouldn't count on
the very best of protection.

1016
01:27:51,748 --> 01:27:54,376
It's you or Schmidt.

1017
01:27:54,985 --> 01:27:57,044
It's just the hand you've been dealt.

1018
01:27:59,656 --> 01:28:02,750
Schmidt believes he walks
in the footsteps of the gods.

1019
01:28:04,494 --> 01:28:07,292
Only the world itself will satisfy him.

1020
01:28:07,397 --> 01:28:09,592
You do realize that's nuts, don't you?

1021
01:28:09,699 --> 01:28:10,666
What?

1022
01:28:11,701 --> 01:28:13,896
The sanity of the plan
is of no consequence.

1023
01:28:14,004 --> 01:28:16,131
- And why is that?
- Because he can do it!

1024
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:18,137
What's his target?

1025
01:28:19,442 --> 01:28:21,774
His target

1026
01:28:23,346 --> 01:28:24,404
is everywhere.

1027
01:28:45,235 --> 01:28:46,862
Tomorrow,

1028
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:50,936
Hydra will stand master of the world,

1029
01:28:51,708 --> 01:28:54,176
<i>borne to victory on the wings
of the Valkyrie.</i>

1030
01:28:55,345 --> 01:28:59,247
Our enemies' weapons
will be powerless against us.

1031
01:28:59,883 --> 01:29:04,843
If they shoot down one plane,
hundreds more will rain fire upon them!

1032
01:29:09,359 --> 01:29:11,725
If they cut off one head,

1033
01:29:12,262 --> 01:29:15,026
two more shall take its place.

1034
01:29:15,398 --> 01:29:16,695
Hail Hydra.

1035
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:17,967
- Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra!

1036
01:29:18,668 --> 01:29:21,296
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!
- Hail Hydra! Hail Hydra!

1037
01:29:33,283 --> 01:29:36,081
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1038
01:29:36,453 --> 01:29:38,421
<i>Please wait for the all-clear.</i>

1039
01:29:38,788 --> 01:29:43,748
<i>Your attention, please. All citizens shall
remain indoors until further notice.</i>

1040
01:29:44,461 --> 01:29:47,521
<i>Blackout is still in effect
throughout the London area.</i>

1041
01:29:55,538 --> 01:29:57,506
Dr. Erskine said that

1042
01:29:57,874 --> 01:30:00,342
the serum wouldn't
just affect my muscles,

1043
01:30:00,443 --> 01:30:02,502
it would affect my cells.

1044
01:30:03,546 --> 01:30:07,346
Create a protective system
of regeneration and healing.

1045
01:30:07,450 --> 01:30:09,077
Which means

1046
01:30:11,387 --> 01:30:13,014
I can't get drunk.

1047
01:30:14,824 --> 01:30:16,121
Did you know that?

1048
01:30:16,559 --> 01:30:20,791
Your metabolism burns four times faster
than the average person.

1049
01:30:22,532 --> 01:30:25,160
He thought it could be
one of the side effects.

1050
01:30:30,173 --> 01:30:32,141
It wasn't your fault.

1051
01:30:33,309 --> 01:30:34,936
- Did you read the report?
- Yes.

1052
01:30:36,146 --> 01:30:37,443
Then you know that's not true.

1053
01:30:37,547 --> 01:30:39,276
You did everything you could.

1054
01:30:42,685 --> 01:30:44,812
Did you believe in your friend?

1055
01:30:44,921 --> 01:30:46,388
Did you respect him?

1056
01:30:48,024 --> 01:30:49,924
Then stop blaming yourself.

1057
01:30:50,293 --> 01:30:52,625
Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice.

1058
01:30:53,029 --> 01:30:54,519
He damn well must have thought
you were worth it.

1059
01:30:57,133 --> 01:30:58,657
I'm going after Schmidt.

1060
01:31:00,303 --> 01:31:03,602
I'm not gonna stop until all of Hydra
is dead or captured.

1061
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:07,169
You won't be alone.

1062
01:31:09,813 --> 01:31:12,976
Johann Schmidt belongs in a bughouse.
He thinks he's a god,

1063
01:31:13,082 --> 01:31:15,016
and he's willing to blow up
half the world to prove it,

1064
01:31:15,118 --> 01:31:16,676
starting with the USA.

1065
01:31:16,786 --> 01:31:19,880
Schmidt's working with powers
beyond our capabilities.

1066
01:31:19,989 --> 01:31:21,718
He gets across the Atlantic,

1067
01:31:21,825 --> 01:31:24,225
he will wipe out
the entire Eastern Seaboard in an hour.

1068
01:31:28,698 --> 01:31:30,290
How much time we got?

1069
01:31:30,400 --> 01:31:32,664
According to my new best friend,
under 24 hours.

1070
01:31:32,769 --> 01:31:35,738
- Where is he now?
- Hydra's last base is here.

1071
01:31:36,606 --> 01:31:40,007
In the Alps, 500 feet below the surface.

1072
01:31:42,045 --> 01:31:43,444
So what are we supposed to do?

1073
01:31:43,546 --> 01:31:46,106
I mean, it's not like
we can just knock on the front door.

1074
01:31:46,783 --> 01:31:48,080
Why not?

1075
01:31:53,189 --> 01:31:55,350
That's exactly what we're going to do.

1076
01:34:00,984 --> 01:34:05,080
Arrogance may not be
a uniquely American trait,

1077
01:34:05,188 --> 01:34:07,281
but I must say,
you do it better than anyone.

1078
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:12,854
But there are limits

1079
01:34:13,229 --> 01:34:15,493
to what even you can do, Captain.

1080
01:34:15,999 --> 01:34:19,230
Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?

1081
01:34:19,335 --> 01:34:20,768
He told me you were insane.

1082
01:34:25,508 --> 01:34:27,476
He resented my genius

1083
01:34:27,577 --> 01:34:31,138
and tried to deny me
what was rightfully mine.

1084
01:34:31,247 --> 01:34:32,805
But he gave you everything.

1085
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:36,479
So,

1086
01:34:38,287 --> 01:34:40,847
what made you so special?

1087
01:34:44,060 --> 01:34:45,186
Nothing.

1088
01:34:46,396 --> 01:34:47,920
I'm just a kid from Brooklyn.

1089
01:34:59,475 --> 01:35:01,033
I can do this all day.

1090
01:35:01,144 --> 01:35:03,135
Of course you can, of course.

1091
01:35:03,246 --> 01:35:06,545
But, unfortunately,
I am on a tight schedule.

1092
01:35:12,255 --> 01:35:13,620
So am I.

1093
01:35:26,102 --> 01:35:28,730
Rogers! You might need this!

1094
01:35:29,205 --> 01:35:30,172
Thanks!

1095
01:35:41,417 --> 01:35:43,908
We're in! Assault team, go!

1096
01:35:44,153 --> 01:35:45,450
Move out!

1097
01:35:46,389 --> 01:35:48,118
Move!

1098
01:35:54,030 --> 01:35:56,055
Keep your spacing!

1099
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:37,832
Cut off one head, two more shall...

1100
01:36:39,375 --> 01:36:41,036
Let's go find two more!

1101
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:08,737
You're late.

1102
01:37:11,774 --> 01:37:13,742
- Weren't you about to...
- Right.

1103
01:38:28,417 --> 01:38:29,406
Get in!

1104
01:38:58,114 --> 01:38:59,411
- Keep it steady!
- Wait!

1105
01:39:04,987 --> 01:39:06,181
Go get him.

1106
01:39:08,157 --> 01:39:09,818
I'm not kissing you!

1107
01:42:49,311 --> 01:42:52,439
- You don't give up, do you?
- Nope!

1108
01:44:01,317 --> 01:44:03,877
You could have the power of the gods!

1109
01:44:04,587 --> 01:44:09,217
Yet you wear a flag on your chest
and think you fight a battle of nations!

1110
01:44:10,125 --> 01:44:12,252
I have seen the future, Captain!

1111
01:44:13,228 --> 01:44:16,254
- There are no flags!
- Not my future!

1112
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:31,169
What have you done?

1113
01:44:32,147 --> 01:44:33,114
No!

1114
01:45:41,417 --> 01:45:43,476
<i>Come in. This is Captain Rogers.
Do you read me?</i>

1115
01:45:43,752 --> 01:45:44,912
Captain Rogers, what is your...

1116
01:45:45,020 --> 01:45:46,419
Steve, is that you? Are you all right?

1117
01:45:46,522 --> 01:45:48,012
<i>Peggy, Schmidt's dead!</i>

1118
01:45:48,724 --> 01:45:50,248
<i>What about the plane?</i>

1119
01:45:52,127 --> 01:45:53,594
That's a little bit tougher to explain.

1120
01:45:54,063 --> 01:45:56,429
Give me your coordinates.
I'll find you a safe landing site.

1121
01:45:57,733 --> 01:45:59,826
There's not gonna be a safe landing.

1122
01:46:00,102 --> 01:46:01,694
<i>But I can try and force it down.</i>

1123
01:46:01,804 --> 01:46:03,772
I'll get Howard on the line.
He'll know what to do.

1124
01:46:03,872 --> 01:46:04,861
<i>There's not enough time.</i>

1125
01:46:04,973 --> 01:46:07,567
<i>This thing's moving too fast
and it's heading for New York.</i>

1126
01:46:12,181 --> 01:46:13,944
I got to put her in the water.

1127
01:46:14,416 --> 01:46:17,112
Please, don't do this.
We have time. We can work it out.

1128
01:46:17,419 --> 01:46:18,545
Right now I'm in the middle of nowhere.

1129
01:46:18,654 --> 01:46:21,054
If I wait any longer,
a lot of people are gonna die.

1130
01:46:26,595 --> 01:46:27,789
Peggy,

1131
01:46:29,598 --> 01:46:30,860
this is my choice.

1132
01:46:55,124 --> 01:46:56,250
Peggy?

1133
01:46:57,126 --> 01:46:58,423
<i>I'm here.</i>

1134
01:47:01,296 --> 01:47:04,094
I'm gonna need a rain check
on that dance.

1135
01:47:12,307 --> 01:47:13,433
All right.

1136
01:47:16,478 --> 01:47:18,844
A week, next Saturday,
at the Stork Club.

1137
01:47:20,315 --> 01:47:21,612
You got it.

1138
01:47:23,552 --> 01:47:27,511
<i>8:00 on the dot.
Don't you dare be late. Understood?</i>

1139
01:47:29,892 --> 01:47:31,951
You know,
I still don't know how to dance.

1140
01:47:38,167 --> 01:47:41,136
I'll show you how. Just be there.

1141
01:47:42,504 --> 01:47:44,131
We'll have the band
play something slow.

1142
01:47:48,243 --> 01:47:49,801
<i>I'd hate to step on your...</i>

1143
01:47:52,848 --> 01:47:53,815
Steve?

1144
01:47:56,351 --> 01:47:57,648
Steve?

1145
01:48:01,023 --> 01:48:02,217
Steve?

1146
01:49:01,283 --> 01:49:02,750
To the Captain.

1147
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:15,897
Sir?

1148
01:49:26,041 --> 01:49:28,009
Take us to the next grid point.

1149
01:49:28,277 --> 01:49:30,336
But there's no trace of wreckage.

1150
01:49:31,046 --> 01:49:33,674
And the energy signature stops here.

1151
01:49:34,783 --> 01:49:36,512
Just keep looking.

1152
01:50:45,120 --> 01:50:47,645
<i>Curve ball,
high and outside for ball one.</i>

1153
01:50:48,957 --> 01:50:51,653
<i>So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4.</i>

1154
01:50:52,561 --> 01:50:54,927
<i>And the crowd well knows that
with one swing of his bat,</i>

1155
01:50:55,030 --> 01:50:57,897
<i>this fellow's capable of making it
a brand-new game again.</i>

1156
01:50:59,368 --> 01:51:02,496
<i>Just an absolutely gorgeous day
here at Ebbets Field.</i>

1157
01:51:03,372 --> 01:51:06,535
<i>The Phillies have managed
to tie it up at 4-4.</i>

1158
01:51:07,376 --> 01:51:09,674
<i>But the Dodgers have three men on.</i>

1159
01:51:14,216 --> 01:51:17,014
<i>Pearson beaned Reiser
in Philadelphia last month.</i>

1160
01:51:17,152 --> 01:51:20,280
<i>Wouldn't the youngster like a hit here
to return the favor?</i>

1161
01:51:20,722 --> 01:51:22,849
<i>Pete leans in. Here's the pitch.</i>

1162
01:51:23,225 --> 01:51:26,285
<i>Swung on. A line to the right.
And it gets past Rizzo.</i>

1163
01:51:28,230 --> 01:51:29,527
<i>Three runs will score.</i>

1164
01:51:29,898 --> 01:51:33,356
<i>Reiser heads to third.
Durocher's going to wave him in.</i>

1165
01:51:34,403 --> 01:51:36,701
<i>Here comes the relay,
but they won't get him.</i>

1166
01:51:38,173 --> 01:51:39,140
Good morning.

1167
01:51:41,176 --> 01:51:42,871
Or should I say afternoon?

1168
01:51:44,012 --> 01:51:45,036
Where am I?

1169
01:51:45,847 --> 01:51:47,838
You're in a recovery room
in New York City.

1170
01:51:49,751 --> 01:51:53,209
<i>The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4.
Oh, Dodgers!</i>

1171
01:51:53,588 --> 01:51:55,385
<i>Everyone is on their feet.</i>

1172
01:51:55,757 --> 01:51:59,090
<i>What a game we have here today, folks.
What a game, indeed.</i>

1173
01:51:59,194 --> 01:52:00,422
Where am I really?

1174
01:52:01,763 --> 01:52:03,731
I'm afraid I don't understand.

1175
01:52:04,533 --> 01:52:05,830
The game.

1176
01:52:06,034 --> 01:52:08,901
It's from May 1941.
I know, 'cause I was there.

1177
01:52:12,941 --> 01:52:14,909
Now, I'm going to ask you again.

1178
01:52:15,477 --> 01:52:16,444
Where am I?

1179
01:52:17,813 --> 01:52:19,110
- Captain Rogers...
- Who are you?

1180
01:52:26,755 --> 01:52:28,382
Captain Rogers, wait!

1181
01:52:30,225 --> 01:52:31,920
All agents, code 13!

1182
01:52:32,427 --> 01:52:35,260
<i>I repeat. All agents, code 13!</i>

1183
01:52:55,917 --> 01:52:57,441
At ease, soldier!

1184
01:53:06,027 --> 01:53:08,928
Look, I'm sorry about that little show
back there,

1185
01:53:10,265 --> 01:53:13,234
but we thought it best
to break it to you slowly.

1186
01:53:13,435 --> 01:53:14,732
Break what?

1187
01:53:17,172 --> 01:53:18,799
You've been asleep, Cap.

1188
01:53:19,307 --> 01:53:21,332
For almost 70 years.

1189
01:53:35,957 --> 01:53:37,151
You gonna be okay?

1190
01:53:38,293 --> 01:53:39,317
Yeah.

1191
01:53:39,694 --> 01:53:40,991
Yeah, I just...

1192
01:53:44,432 --> 01:53:45,922
I had a date.

1193
02:03:07,595 --> 02:03:09,222
Trouble sleeping?

1194
02:03:12,100 --> 02:03:13,397
You're here with a mission, sir?

1195
02:03:14,368 --> 02:03:15,357
I am.

1196
02:03:16,104 --> 02:03:17,901
Trying to get me back in the world?

1197
02:03:19,140 --> 02:03:20,368
Trying to save it.

1198
02:03:29,450 --> 02:03:31,213
<i>You think you're the only hero
in the world?</i>

1199
02:03:45,466 --> 02:03:46,592
Gentlemen?

1200
02:03:47,401 --> 02:03:48,459
You're up.

1201
02:03:54,892 --> 02:03:55,859
Got a mean swing.
