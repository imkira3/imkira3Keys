- Uh-huh.

And I suppose you'd want me to
take my clothes off too, right?

There is just one
little problem.

What's that?

64
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:52,577
You'd have to figure out how
to take the lens cap off.

65
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,946
- I'd have figured that out.
- Oh.

66
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,649
Eventually.

67
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:03,556
This is Claire.

68
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:27,647
When was the last time
you saw your brother?

69
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:33,952
It had been awhile.

70
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,888
He moved around a lot.

71
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,857
He ever say why?

72
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:41,460
When you have a rough childhood,

73
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,196
it's hard to feel comfortable.

74
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,066
Any idea what he
was doing upstate?

75
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:50,902
Is this about my brother's
death or my brother?

76
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:52,505
Answer the question.

77
00:07:53,906 --> 00:07:57,175
No. No idea.

78
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:59,478
And you had no contact with him?

79
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,047
Every once in a while I
would get an email, okay?

80
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,182
That's it.

81
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,719
What is this about? Did
he do something wrong?

82
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,230
Parker, Arizona.

83
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:22,134
Crawford, Colorado.

84
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:27,272
Farmington, New Mexico.

85
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:31,009
Each of these were taken when
your brother was either living

86
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:35,213
or staying within five
miles of the scene.

87
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,582
Now, I'm gonna ask you again.

88
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:41,521
Do you have any idea what your
brother was doing upstate?

89
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:53,299
All right.

90
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,169
I think we're done here.

91
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:01,706
Do me a favor.

92
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,642
Stay available...

93
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,812
just in case we have
any more questions.

94
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,181
Wait.

95
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:14,719
My brother's daughter, Madison.

96
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,856
Where is she?

97
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:20,592
The child is exhibiting

98
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,328
extreme signs of
post-traumatic stress.

99
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:25,130
It's not surprising,
given the circumstances.

100
00:09:25,131 --> 00:09:26,765
The police interviewed
her at length,

101
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,033
regarding the death
of her father,

102
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,201
but she was uncooperative.

103
00:09:30,202 --> 00:09:32,871
Has she said anything
about that night?

104
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,173
Madison thinks someone
named "The Sandman"

105
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:37,142
is responsible for the
death of her father.

106
00:09:37,143 --> 00:09:38,577
The Sandman?

107
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:39,744
Children often make up boogeymen

108
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,746
to deal with their
real life fears.

109
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,115
Fear of the dark,
fear of the unknown.

110
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,751
I think this Sandman
is Madison's way

111
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:50,622
of dealing with the
death of her parents.

112
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:53,124
Is this for her protection?

113
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,094
Ours.

114
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,631
No! Let go of me!

115
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:01,199
I don't wanna be here anymore!

116
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,735
- I wanna go home!
- Be still!

117
00:10:03,736 --> 00:10:05,237
No! No!

118
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,907
- Be still!
- Let go of me!

119
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,009
How about I give you
something to calm you down?

120
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,746
No!

121
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,407
Hey!

122
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:48,146
Madison!

123
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,349
Madison!

124
00:10:54,353 --> 00:10:55,888
- Grab her.
- Come on!

125
00:10:57,957 --> 00:11:00,292
Take her back to the room!

126
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:03,962
Like I said.

127
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:06,265
Uncooperative.

128
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,887
Her eyes are so soulful.

129
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,689
I'm Mrs. Farmer.

130
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,958
Department of
Children's Services.

131
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:35,795
Claire.

132
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,465
My brother told me she
was born en-caul.

133
00:11:40,466 --> 00:11:44,270
It's where the amniotic
sac is still intact.

134
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,706
Apparently, it's special.

135
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:52,277
It's supposed to
be a sign of luck.

136
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:55,980
Madison is a lot things.

137
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:58,950
I wouldn't say
lucky's one of them.

138
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,419
Miss Blake, do you have a
moment where we could...

139
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,888
go somewhere and chat?

140
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,993
Yeah.

141
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:14,966
The good news, Miss Blake,
is we have a system in place

142
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:20,105
to help children like your niece
receive the care that she needs.

143
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,174
You mean with someone other
than with her family.

144
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:27,445
I assumed, with your background,
you wouldn't be seeking custody.

145
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,948
- What does that mean?
- Miss Blake...

146
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:33,818
Don't you think we should be
talking about this first?

147
00:12:33,819 --> 00:12:36,821
Do you have any experience
raising a child?

148
00:12:36,822 --> 00:12:38,056
No.

149
00:12:38,057 --> 00:12:40,859
- Are you married?
- No.

150
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,293
What about your career?

151
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,764
Okay, look.

152
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:49,100
I understand that I'm not a
perfect housewife, okay?

153
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,003
But my brother would have
never wanted his daughter

154
00:12:52,004 --> 00:12:53,338
raised by strangers.

155
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:54,939
Even if those strangers
were better equipped

156
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,475
to see that his daughter
received a proper upbringing?

157
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,945
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

158
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:03,282
Can you afford one?

159
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:10,155
Miss Blake, because you are the
girl's only living relative,

160
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:14,526
no one can prevent you from
taking custody temporarily.

161
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:19,865
Permanent guardianship,
however, is another matter.

162
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,522
Daddy?

163
00:14:29,335 --> 00:14:32,270
Help! Somebody!

164
00:14:32,271 --> 00:14:35,473
What's happening? Madison?

165
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:37,442
- She's having a nightmare!
- Madison?

166
00:14:37,443 --> 00:14:39,511
Get away from me!

167
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,185
Four milligrams of ketamine.

168
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:49,320
Madison, hey, can you hear me?

169
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:51,323
Can you hear me?

170
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:57,896
Hey.

171
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,398
There you are. It's all right.

172
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,901
It's just a dream.

173
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,137
Is he gone?

174
00:15:06,138 --> 00:15:08,206
Who?

175
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:10,542
The Sandman.

176
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:16,047
Yeah.

177
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,348
He's gone.

178
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,551
You're safe.

179
00:15:23,289 --> 00:15:27,026
Hey, do you know who I am?

180
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:31,996
Aunt Claire?

181
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,199
You can just call
me Claire, okay?

182
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,102
Hopefully you're gonna come
live with me really soon.

183
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,505
How does that sound?

184
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,607
Don't make promises.

185
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,010
She's just a little girl.
She needs some hope.

186
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:49,580
She needs to stay here
for further examination.

187
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,083
Indefinitely.

188
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,223
He's scary.

189
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,127
He just wants what's
best for you.

190
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:08,132
Can you stay with me
till I fall back asleep?

191
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:12,270
I'll do even better and stay
with you while you're asleep.

192
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,974
How's that sound?

193
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:27,218
Shortly after she arrived,

194
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:32,023
Madison started exhibiting
symptoms of night terrors.

195
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:33,624
After one of the
orderlies was hurt,

196
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:37,295
we started a policy of
restraining her at bedtime.

197
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:41,632
Typical patient might suffer
one to two episodes a week.

198
00:16:41,633 --> 00:16:45,703
Madison suffers three
to four a night.

199
00:16:45,704 --> 00:16:48,206
We recommend that Madison
remain in our care

200
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,777
for further observation.

201
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,238
Miss Duffy?

202
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,444
You know you're not supposed to
be out of your room after 11.

203
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:03,148
Miss Duffy?

204
00:18:04,516 --> 00:18:07,319
I know you're in here somewhere.

205
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:17,695
Megan, what are you
doing down there?

206
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:21,632
He... He...

207
00:18:21,633 --> 00:18:25,104
He was... there.

208
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:16,387
Oh, don't worry about him.

209
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:18,256
That's just Stanley.

210
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:19,892
Hi, Stanley!

211
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:22,794
Let's go.

212
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:32,436
It's just right through there.

213
00:19:32,437 --> 00:19:36,307
Hey! There she is!

214
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:38,743
Wyatt, this is Madison.

215
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,479
Madison, this is my...
This is Wyatt.

216
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,681
Hi, Madison.

217
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:48,352
So what do you think?

218
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:52,757
I painted the walls,
I got some toys.

219
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:55,693
Oh. Bow and arrow
for a little girl?

220
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,228
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

221
00:19:57,229 --> 00:19:59,497
Where'd you get all this stuff?

222
00:19:59,498 --> 00:20:00,765
Goodwill.

223
00:20:00,766 --> 00:20:03,267
I had like a $5 budget. Come on.

224
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,837
Yeah, you're right.

225
00:20:09,274 --> 00:20:11,342
I'm gonna...

226
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,378
Yeah.

227
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:21,953
Oh, this is a good song, right?

228
00:20:21,954 --> 00:20:23,454
♪

229
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,924
When can I go home?

230
00:20:30,629 --> 00:20:32,898
Well, um...

231
00:20:36,868 --> 00:20:39,804
This is your home.

232
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,540
It's your new home.

233
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,543
Here with me.

234
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,480
Um, what about Wyatt?

235
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,017
Wyatt? Sometimes.

236
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,690
I know this is a big change.

237
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:02,393
It's really different.

238
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:05,429
I know I can't replace your dad,

239
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,832
but I promise you,

240
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:10,968
no matter what, I'm...

241
00:21:10,969 --> 00:21:13,972
I'm gonna try my best.

242
00:21:16,475 --> 00:21:19,544
You wanna get settled, and
I'll make us some dinner?

243
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,383
See you in a minute, okay?

244
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,913
Hello?

245
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,616
Claire?

246
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,010
Hello?

247
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,348
Claire?

248
00:24:21,526 --> 00:24:25,763
- Help! Help me!
- Hey, Madison, hey.

249
00:24:25,764 --> 00:24:27,798
You're okay.

250
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,034
It's just a bad dream.

251
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:32,003
That's it.

252
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,743
Is he gone?

253
00:24:39,744 --> 00:24:41,779
Who?

254
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,647
The Sandman.

255
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,249
He followed me.

256
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,786
Honey, it's just
you and me here.

257
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:50,121
I promise.

258
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,058
What happened?

259
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,861
He grabbed me.

260
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:59,797
Madison...

261
00:24:59,798 --> 00:25:01,799
Can I sleep in your bed tonight?

262
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,569
Of course, come on.

263
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:21,585
The investigation suffered
another setback today

264
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,087
when this man, Colton Blake,

265
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:24,822
previously named a
person of interest,

266
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:27,224
was found dead himself
last weekend,

267
00:25:27,225 --> 00:25:28,959
apparently of a heart attack.

268
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,095
Police found his body
at the general store.

269
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,697
Investigation is looking
further into it.

270
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:36,967
Blake is survived by sister
Claire and daughter Madison.

271
00:25:36,968 --> 00:25:39,236
Madison is currently in
the custody of her aunt,

272
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:41,138
who lives in Los Angeles.

273
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:43,841
Now, the unusually hot weather
looks like it's gonna continue

274
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:46,544
through the end of the
week, and DWP is...

275
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,614
Whatever it is, she thinks
it followed her here.

276
00:25:50,615 --> 00:25:55,587
All of the nightmares about her
parents and the boogeyman...

277
00:25:57,622 --> 00:25:59,790
I don't know. It feels like
it's just Madison's way

278
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,093
of working through her grief.

279
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,336
Yeah, and last night, get...

280
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:18,042
Get this, she woke up last
night with bruises on her arm.

281
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,812
I swear they weren't
there before.

282
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,189
No, you should see the
way she kicks and flails

283
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,891
in her sleep.

284
00:26:33,892 --> 00:26:37,262
It's a wonder she doesn't
put me in the hospital.

285
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:41,366
No, I know.

286
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,636
I understand.

287
00:26:45,637 --> 00:26:47,839
All right, I'll
talk to you later.

288
00:26:50,909 --> 00:26:53,844
Madison? Madison,
it isn't funny.

289
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:58,382
You're gonna give
me a heart attack!

290
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,884
There was an old woman
who lived in a shoe.

291
00:27:00,885 --> 00:27:04,121
She had so many children,
she didn't know what to do.

292
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,225
She gave them some broth
without any bread.

293
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:11,328
There was an old woman
who lived in a shoe.

294
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,932
She had so many children,
she didn't know what to do.

295
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:47,965
What'd I tell you about
getting out, boy?

296
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:51,935
What'd I tell you about that?
Sit down.

297
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:57,408
You know, I saw a girl
on the news last night.

298
00:27:57,409 --> 00:28:00,110
Looked just like you.

299
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:02,913
Your daddy killed
them, didn't he?

300
00:28:02,914 --> 00:28:04,982
Yeah.

301
00:28:04,983 --> 00:28:07,284
That's why you were running.

302
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,954
Yeah, go ahead, run away.

303
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,791
Hey.

304
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:14,858
What's going on?

305
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,227
Here she comes
again, that woman.

306
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:19,730
Hey, what the hell
was that about?

307
00:28:19,731 --> 00:28:21,932
The police were looking
for her father, you know.

308
00:28:21,933 --> 00:28:25,235
He's dead. Don't you think
she's suffered enough?

309
00:28:25,236 --> 00:28:26,904
What the hell you doing
with a kid anyway, huh?

310
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,205
All that loud music,

311
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,007
people coming in and out
all hours of the night

312
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:31,275
I work out of my house.

313
00:28:31,276 --> 00:28:35,012
Well, not for long,
which, incidentally,

314
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:38,817
is what I told that woman who
came by your house today.

315
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:17,989
Yeah.

316
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,501
What?

317
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:34,305
What the hell?

318
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,548
Goddamn it!

319
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,456
Ah.

320
00:29:57,195 --> 00:29:58,396
Come on.

321
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,874
What the...

322
00:30:27,926 --> 00:30:28,959
Start.

323
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,829
Start, come on, start!

324
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,431
Start!

325
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,035
Come on!

326
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,844
Damn straight. Okay.

327
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:02,025
Ahh...

328
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:07,898
Good. Let's check your arms.
Raise your left arm for me.

329
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:12,636
Does that hurt?
Let's take a look.

330
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:16,506
Madison, can you tell
me what happened here?

331
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,943
Can your aunt?

332
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,446
I'm, uh...

333
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:25,182
I'm renting an old house, so...

334
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:27,118
You know kids.

335
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:33,557
Try to be more careful, okay?

336
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:35,192
I'd like to see her
again in a week,

337
00:31:35,193 --> 00:31:36,960
see how they're healing.

338
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,228
Sure.

339
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,663
Ms. Blake, let's make
sure there aren't

340
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:42,634
any more accidents, okay?

341
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,453
Go inside, okay?

342
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:05,623
I'll be in in a minute.

343
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:23,240
Whoa, whoa. Stay off
the property, please.

344
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:24,574
I live across the street.

345
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:26,510
Can't you just tell
me what's going on?

346
00:32:26,511 --> 00:32:28,145
Carbon monoxide poisoning.

347
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:31,114
Looks like the garage door
may have malfunctioned.

348
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,218
All this for an accident?

349
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,391
Hey! Hey, I've seen you before.

350
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:44,127
Who are you? What
are you doing here?

351
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,996
Ma'am, is there
gonna be a problem?

352
00:32:45,997 --> 00:32:49,133
No! There's no problem.
I'm going.

353
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,551
So did something
happen to Stanley?

354
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:11,756
Um, there was an accident.

355
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,225
Are they sure?

356
00:33:15,226 --> 00:33:17,227
Sure about what?

357
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:19,097
That it was an accident.

358
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,167
Madison...

359
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:27,238
do you know something about
what happened to Stanley?

360
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:32,643
Madison.

361
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:40,317
- Madison!
- Go away!

362
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:43,320
Madison, do you know what
happened to Stanley?

363
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:46,324
I said go away!

364
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:57,602
All right, Colton, let's see
what you've been up to.

365
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,707
Oh, Jesus.

366
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,787
So you think your brother is
responsible for all of this.

367
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:53,323
The police were asking
a lot of questions,

368
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,258
and then Stanley...

369
00:34:55,259 --> 00:35:00,163
Okay, look, even if your brother
was responsible for any of this,

370
00:35:00,164 --> 00:35:01,798
he's dead.

371
00:35:01,799 --> 00:35:04,401
- I know.
- I thought you saw the body.

372
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:06,103
I know.

373
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:08,538
Okay, so what did
Madison have to say?

374
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,307
Nothing.

375
00:35:10,308 --> 00:35:12,542
She won't talk to me.

376
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,712
I don't know what to do.

377
00:35:16,481 --> 00:35:18,116
I do.

378
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:25,388
Madison?

379
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:27,358
You in here?

380
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:30,328
Honey, wait, no.

381
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:39,169
Madison, we need you
to tell us something,

382
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:45,575
and I want you to try to be
really honest with me, okay?

383
00:35:45,576 --> 00:35:48,845
Did your daddy ever...

384
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:51,382
Did he ever hurt anyone?

385
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,922
Honey, please, you can trust us.

386
00:36:00,858 --> 00:36:03,660
He said he was
trying to protect me

387
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,862
from the bad people.

388
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:10,500
That's what he
said he was doing?

389
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,302
Trying to protect you?

390
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,738
Daddy never hurt anyone.

391
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,440
Who did, Madison?

392
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,342
Who killed all those people?

393
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,378
Wyatt.

394
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,647
Please don't be mad.

395
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:26,483
Sweetheart, I'm not mad.

396
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:30,755
I just need you to tell me.
I promise you can trust me.

397
00:36:43,768 --> 00:36:48,505
Sometimes, when I
get really scared,

398
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:51,208
he comes out and hurts people.

399
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,842
What do you mean, he comes out?

400
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,579
I can't control it.

401
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,948
It just happens.

402
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:01,918
Like with Stanley and Daddy.

403
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:05,755
Honey, your dad had
a heart attack.

404
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:09,259
And Stanley was an accident. I
spoke to the police myself.

405
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,462
He wanted to get rid of me.

406
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,398
Look, are you saying...

407
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,769
that you think that
you made this guy

408
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:22,405
come out and kill people?

409
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,241
I didn't mean to!

410
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,409
I didn't want to
hurt any of them!

411
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,677
I just got scared.

412
00:37:27,678 --> 00:37:29,980
The Sandman is a
character in a book.

413
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,581
You can't bring it to life.

414
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,416
I can!

415
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,919
Ever since I was little,

416
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,754
Daddy said I could
make things happen,

417
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,757
but he said it's okay 'cause
it's gonna be over soon.

418
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,993
What did he mean by "over soon?"

419
00:37:42,994 --> 00:37:45,562
All right, cool. I've
heard enough of this.

420
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,998
Madison, we're trying to
have a serious conversation,

421
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:49,799
and you're not playing.

422
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,636
I don't think that you should
have this book anymore, okay?

423
00:37:52,637 --> 00:37:53,804
Come on.

424
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,007
I'm not lying!

425
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,343
Why don't you just sit here,
and you think about it!

426
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:02,045
- Wyatt?
- When you're ready to talk,

427
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:03,713
we'll come in, and we'll listen.

428
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,382
I told you!

429
00:38:05,383 --> 00:38:07,584
Yeah, yeah, I heard.
The Sandman, okay?

430
00:38:07,585 --> 00:38:11,454
Why don't you pay a semblance
of respect to your aunt,

431
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,290
after everything's
she's done for you!

432
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,591
But you don't wanna do that

433
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:17,327
because you're acting
like a spoiled child

434
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,764
who wants to make up things out
of books and kills people.

435
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:23,534
Stop yelling at me!

436
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:39,616
- Look, this isn't a good time.
- I hope I'm not interrupting.

437
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:42,619
Mrs. Farmer, please,
it's been a long day.

438
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,787
And you are?

439
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,058
I'm Wyatt, her
sometimes boyfriend.

440
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:49,726
Can I ask what this is about?

441
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,961
This afternoon, I received
a rather alarming call

442
00:38:51,962 --> 00:38:53,563
from your pediatrician.

443
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,066
He said your niece had a
number of bruises on her arm.

444
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,334
What's she talking about?

445
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,902
Nothing. Look, I
explained to him

446
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:00,337
that she was playing
in the house.

447
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,372
- She fell.
- He also told me

448
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,508
he was unable to rule
out physical abuse.

449
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,812
Okay, hold on. Claire
would never hurt a child.

450
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,847
Maybe it wasn't Claire.

451
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,384
Unfortunately, even the
suspicion of abuse

452
00:39:14,385 --> 00:39:16,419
is enough to suspend
temporary custody

453
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,655
until an investigation
can be completed.

454
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:20,857
I have a letter from the
state authorizing me

455
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,826
to remove Madison
from your home.

456
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:24,728
- Wait, what?
- Ms. Blake,

457
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,531
don't make this any harder
than it needs to be.

458
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,501
Okay, just hold...

459
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:34,738
Maybe we ought to consider
this a good thing.

460
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:35,905
No! You're not taking her.

461
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:39,075
Ms. Blake, allow
me to remind you

462
00:39:39,076 --> 00:39:41,945
that if you don't
participate willingly,

463
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,914
I will be forced to
take punitive action.

464
00:39:44,915 --> 00:39:47,417
Fine, go ahead.

465
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,453
Have it your way, Ms. Blake,

466
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:55,458
because I will be back with
the proper authorities.

467
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:59,562
Great! And we'll be here!

468
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,698
Claire, seriously.

469
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:05,001
Madison, honey, Wyatt
and I are gonna outside

470
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:09,707
and have a little adult
conversation, okay?

471
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:20,049
It's me.

472
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,453
No. Unfortunately the
aunt's being stubborn.

473
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,524
We're probably gonna
have to call the police.

474
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,597
You know what?

475
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:37,535
I'm gonna have to call you back.

476
00:40:42,006 --> 00:40:43,706
- Are you out of your mind?
- What?

477
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:46,543
You know she could come back
with the police and arrest you.

478
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,878
Do you what would happen if
they got their hands on her?

479
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:51,781
Claire, this isn't some
kid who just wets the bed

480
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,616
or plays with matches, okay?

481
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:56,187
You are way, way out
of your league here.

482
00:41:03,527 --> 00:41:06,029
My brother spent a long
time trying to protect her.

483
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,666
Ever think maybe he was trying
to protect peopfrom her?

484
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:11,601
There's a big difference
there, don't you think?

485
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:14,938
Our whole childhood, we
were just shuffled around.

486
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:16,606
My mom was a drunk.

487
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:20,109
My dad was gone before
I was even born.

488
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,779
All we had was each other.

489
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,849
I owe it to him to protect her.

490
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,822
Madison?

491
00:41:36,794 --> 00:41:39,596
Are you in here, sweetie?

492
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,931
Don't you think it's better
that she's with someone

493
00:41:41,932 --> 00:41:43,099
that knows how to handle her?

494
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,668
Who? The bad people?

495
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,036
Wyatt, that's what
she calls them.

496
00:41:47,037 --> 00:41:49,539
How many people has she hurt?

497
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,040
Because what I think
we should be doing

498
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,711
is talking about the
definition of "bad" here.

499
00:41:55,913 --> 00:41:58,581
Madison, I wanna help.

500
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:02,720
Go away.

501
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,834
It's not safe for you here.

502
00:42:17,835 --> 00:42:20,537
I'm gonna to take you
someplace better,

503
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,005
where you'll be happy.

504
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,574
I'm happy here!

505
00:42:24,575 --> 00:42:26,643
You can't stay here, Madison.

506
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:29,178
I know you don't
understand right now,

507
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,014
but one day you will.

508
00:42:31,015 --> 00:42:35,318
There's no need to worry.

509
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:38,656
I'm not the one I'm
worried about.

510
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:55,272
Hey, what's going on?

511
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:25,803
I'm sorry.

512
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:53,296
You're doing fine.
Remember your breathing.

513
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,099
You're doing great.

514
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,368
Something's wrong.

515
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:00,670
What's happening?

516
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:03,906
What is going on? No!
What is happening?

517
00:44:03,907 --> 00:44:05,308
Breathe, breathe.

518
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,679
Female, 28, intrapartum.
She's crowning!

519
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,954
Wyatt doesn't like me.

520
00:45:26,090 --> 00:45:28,458
That's not true.

521
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:30,427
Right?

522
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:45,409
Madison, I think we should talk
about what happened last night.

523
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:50,379
You said it was all
gonna be over soon.

524
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:53,016
What did you mean by that?

525
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,257
Is that what you were doing
when your daddy died?

526
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:07,531
Did your dad find a
way to stop this?

527
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,467
We gotta call the police.

528
00:46:11,468 --> 00:46:13,936
And say what? There's
nothing left.

529
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,905
There's no body,
there's no evidence.

530
00:46:15,906 --> 00:46:18,374
What do you suggest? I'm
not just gonna sit around

531
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:20,476
while she wishes everyone
into a cornfield.

532
00:46:20,477 --> 00:46:22,979
I told you how important
she is to me.

533
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:25,314
And you saw what she
did to that woman.

534
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,416
What she almost did to you.

535
00:46:27,417 --> 00:46:29,452
I'm... I'm worried about you.

536
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,954
She wouldn't hurt me.

537
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,023
Like she wouldn't
hurt your brother?

538
00:46:34,024 --> 00:46:36,926
The detectives were asking
what he doing upstate.

539
00:46:36,927 --> 00:46:39,495
What if my brother found a
way to help her stop this?

540
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:42,933
More like he was wishing
not to get thrown in jail.

541
00:46:44,034 --> 00:46:46,035
Would you watch her
for a couple hours?

542
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,504
- Are you serious?
- Please, I just...

543
00:46:48,505 --> 00:46:50,306
I don't want her to go outside.

544
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:54,076
That's the smartest thing
I've heard you say all day.

545
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,580
Are you gonna help me or not?

546
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:06,222
Couple hours.

547
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,859
That's it.

548
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:11,929
Okay.

549
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,870
Thanks for letting
me take a look.

550
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:23,372
You know, she hasn't
stopped crying about it.

551
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:25,474
I gotta say, Ms. Blake,

552
00:47:25,475 --> 00:47:27,543
we've been over this car
half a dozen times,

553
00:47:27,544 --> 00:47:30,246
and no one's come up
with a stuffed animal.

554
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:34,550
I know. I just figured if I
looked, maybe I'd find it.

555
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:37,486
She hasn't said
anything, has she?

556
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:41,357
She's an eight-year-old little
girl who lost her father,

557
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:44,962
spends most of her time
crying in her room.

558
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:08,652
Detective.

559
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,923
I'll need you to sign
this access form.

560
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,184
Hi, you've reached Dr. Amanda.

561
00:48:42,185 --> 00:48:44,453
Please leave a message.

562
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:46,989
Hi, my name is Claire Blake.

563
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:48,624
I believe you spoke
to my brother Colton

564
00:48:48,625 --> 00:48:52,528
about my niece Madison.

565
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:54,531
Call me, please.

566
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:00,971
Hello?

567
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,479
Wyatt?

568
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,548
Where are we?

569
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,718
Well, it's a surprise.

570
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:52,221
Is Claire coming?

571
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:55,558
I thought that this should be
something we could do together.

572
00:49:55,559 --> 00:49:59,028
Get to know each other
a little better, hmm?

573
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:01,197
Okay.

574
00:50:01,198 --> 00:50:03,132
Why don't you go ahead?

575
00:50:03,133 --> 00:50:05,268
I'll be out there.

576
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:28,325
You can do this.

577
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,602
Are you coming?

578
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,601
Pretty cool, huh?

579
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:16,605
Yeah.

580
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,676
Hey, how about that
doll right over there?

581
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,345
Where?

582
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:25,581
Right over by the...

583
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,383
the truck.

584
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:30,252
You see it?

585
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,421
Just to the right.

586
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,325
I don't see anything
but old junky cars.

587
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,300
What are you doing?

588
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:45,735
Madison.

589
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,807
- Were you gonna hurt me?
- Calm down.

590
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,677
This is why you didn't
bring Claire, isn't it?

591
00:51:54,678 --> 00:51:58,114
Do you want her to get hurt?

592
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,683
I don't.

593
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:05,222
Madison, okay.

594
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:09,159
Okay, I need you to calm down.

595
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:12,896
Madison, okay, look, I
made a mistake, okay?

596
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,668
Madison?

597
00:52:20,203 --> 00:52:21,371
Please.

598
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:25,675
I think you should run now.

599
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:57,474
What? Wha...

600
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:41,784
- Sir.
- Bring her in, Heller.

601
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:43,453
Yes, sir.

602
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:08,510
♪ Yo-ho, all aboard
'cause here we go ♪

603
00:54:08,511 --> 00:54:12,581

anchor and sail off ♪

606
00:54:21,391 --> 00:54:23,559
Extra whipped cream,
just like you asked.

607
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,894
Thanks.

608
00:54:35,305 --> 00:54:36,639
Thank God.

609
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,908
I was so worried about you.

610
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:42,444
I'm sorry.

611
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:45,614
It's okay.

612
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,051
Where's Wyatt?

613
00:54:53,423 --> 00:54:54,557
Madison?

614
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,830
What did you do to Wyatt?

615
00:55:01,831 --> 00:55:04,534
I'm ready to go home now.

616
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:08,471
Sure.

617
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:14,444
Can we stop somewhere
on the way home?

618
00:55:15,578 --> 00:55:18,415
Yeah, okay.

619
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:47,811
I need to take this. I'll
meet you there, okay?

620
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:58,387
- Hi.
- Claire?

621
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,788
Yes. Um...

622
00:55:59,789 --> 00:56:01,524
Is she with you now?

623
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:07,062
- Can you help her?
- Yes.

624
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:12,468
Are you familiar with the theory
of hypnotic image therapy?

625
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:15,938
Well, it started as a
way to treat soldiers

626
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:18,540
who were suffering
from acute PTSD.

627
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,677
Doctors used hypnosis to
rewrite their nightmares,

628
00:56:21,678 --> 00:56:24,613
so they no longer
felt threatening.

629
00:56:24,614 --> 00:56:27,416
You want to hypnotize my niece?

630
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:30,586
Your brother believed she was
using the power of the caul

631
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:33,389
to manifest a
nightmarish figure.

632
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,823
The Sandman.

633
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,592
However, if we could remove

634
00:56:36,593 --> 00:56:39,061
this so-called Sandman
from her mind...

635
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,130
She wouldn't be able
to bring it to life.

636
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:42,564
Exactly.

637
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,434
You haven't seen what
she's capable of.

638
00:56:45,435 --> 00:56:48,904
I don't know if messing with
her mind is such a good idea.

639
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:51,974
Your brother believed it
was a risk worth taking.

640
00:56:51,975 --> 00:56:56,679
All I want is to give Madison
a chance at a normal life.

641
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:05,187
I'm so sorry for
everything I've done.

642
00:57:05,188 --> 00:57:07,489
I know people say I'm special,

643
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:12,127
but I don't want to
be special anymore.

644
00:57:12,128 --> 00:57:16,565
I don't want anyone
else to get hurt,

645
00:57:16,566 --> 00:57:18,868
especially not Claire.

646
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:29,446
Do you think they
know I'm sorry?

647
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:34,750
Honey, yes.

648
00:57:34,751 --> 00:57:36,519
Of course they do.

649
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,245
Madison?

650
00:58:04,547 --> 00:58:07,851
Your father may have found
someone that can help you.

651
00:58:09,652 --> 00:58:13,722
I don't know anything about
her, but if there's a chance...

652
00:58:13,723 --> 00:58:17,793
Yes, yes.

653
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:19,262
Yes.

654
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,212
Look out!

655
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,115
Get the girl! Move!

656
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:51,528
You shouldn't have hurt Claire.

657
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,205
Careful.

658
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,043
We got movement.

659
00:59:08,578 --> 00:59:11,614
Multiple bogeys. Repeat,
multiple bogeys.

660
00:59:20,156 --> 00:59:22,325
Negative on visual, sir.

661
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,195
Careful.

662
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:39,242
What just happened?

663
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,613
I'm having trouble
with my scope.

664
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,819
Where's your signal?

665
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,357
Damn thing!

666
00:59:55,358 --> 00:59:57,727
Night vision's out.

667
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,772
I got nothing.

668
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,489
Target secured.

669
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,033
Where is she?

670
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:19,835
- What have you done to her?
- Don't worry.

671
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:22,872
I have absolutely no intention
of hurting your niece.

672
01:02:25,808 --> 01:02:29,177
My department has studied
a lot of caul children

673
01:02:29,178 --> 01:02:30,913
over the years.

674
01:02:32,048 --> 01:02:34,449
But none of them as powerful

675
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:38,120
or as dangerous as Madison.

676
01:02:38,121 --> 01:02:40,188
No.

677
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:45,494
Now, can you imagine having
the abilities that she has,

678
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:48,797
without the patience or the
discipline to control them?

679
01:02:48,798 --> 01:02:51,967
Please, please, just
let me see her.

680
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:56,873
She mentioned something to
the doctor called "Sandman."

681
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,544
She ever mention that to you?

682
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,382
You wanna know
about the Sandman?

683
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,188
That's a children's book.

684
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,391
Her father read it to her
when she was a little girl.

685
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:20,029
She says it gave her bad dreams.

686
01:03:22,365 --> 01:03:25,834
I truly believe
that in her fear,

687
01:03:25,835 --> 01:03:29,005
she literally brought
her nightmare to life.

688
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:33,308
Extraordinary.

689
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:37,379
Look, she's just a little girl.

690
01:03:37,380 --> 01:03:40,315
All she wants is for it to stop.

691
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:43,451
But I don't want it to stop.

692
01:03:43,452 --> 01:03:46,988
I wanna nurture it,
I wanna develop it,

693
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,358
and I wanna train it.

694
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,528
You've seen what
she's capable of.

695
01:03:53,529 --> 01:03:56,999
Come here. I wanna
show you something.

696
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:04,073
Madison!

697
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,481
What is this?

698
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:18,120
We're completely
shielded from her.

699
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,123
Makes it safer.

700
01:04:35,371 --> 01:04:39,642
I'd like to start with
a levitation test.

701
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:42,912
We can begin.

702
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,953
Our most successful
subject to date

703
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:56,024
was able to levitate this
ball more than three inches.

704
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:59,629
Let's see how young
Madison can do.

705
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:06,134
Madison, I'd like you to
try levitating the ball.

706
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:07,269
No.

707
01:05:07,270 --> 01:05:10,472
Madison, please.

708
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,574
The sooner that you
cooperate with us,

709
01:05:12,575 --> 01:05:14,609
the sooner I can let
you see Claire.

710
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,178
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

711
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,415
Good.

712
01:05:20,416 --> 01:05:22,418
Then, please.

713
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:32,428
Concentrate.

714
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:37,033
Focus on the ball.

715
01:05:54,583 --> 01:05:56,986
Extraordinary.

716
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,627
I want to go home.

717
01:06:06,262 --> 01:06:07,429
Soon, Madison.

718
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,499
I want to go home now!

719
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,173
What's going on?

720
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,755
Sedate her! Now!

721
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:46,001
I believe that with
the proper regimen,

722
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:49,271
we can train her to
control her impulses.

723
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,641
So you want me to go
before the committee

724
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:56,111
and explain what?

725
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:58,780
That we're going to tame an
eight-year-old mass murderer?

726
01:06:58,781 --> 01:07:00,715
She's not malicious.

727
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:03,184
Neither is the sweet
family pit bull,

728
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:06,221
until it mauls your
three-month-old child.

729
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:08,623
I believe in her potential.

730
01:07:08,624 --> 01:07:10,258
Sorry, Dr. Valentine.

731
01:07:10,259 --> 01:07:12,594
I'm initiating cleanup protocol.

732
01:07:12,595 --> 01:07:15,430
Give me a chance with her.

733
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:17,499
She's too valuable.

734
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:19,235
No.

735
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,572
I'm sorry, Dr. Valentine.

736
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,775
We've been asked
to clear the room.

737
01:08:01,644 --> 01:08:03,111
No.

738
01:08:03,112 --> 01:08:05,213
- We have to leave now.
- No.

739
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:07,115
No, no, please!

740
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,117
- No!
- We have to leave now.

741
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:11,352
- It's out of my hands!
- Please!

742
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:12,488
It's out of my hands.

743
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:01,303
Lock it down!

744
01:09:06,542 --> 01:09:10,713
No, no, please! I
have to help her!

745
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,340
Go to the end of the hall,
down to sublevel five.

746
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:42,377
Follow the steam pipes.
That'll get you out of here.

747
01:09:42,378 --> 01:09:43,678
Take my car.

748
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:44,946
You drive away from here

749
01:09:44,947 --> 01:09:47,616
and never look back, understand?

750
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:53,722
Hey!

751
01:10:42,471 --> 01:10:43,739
Let's go.

752
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:55,451
She went down this way!

753
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,537
Stay here.

754
01:11:25,781 --> 01:11:27,382
Here!

755
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:28,917
Madison.

756
01:11:30,786 --> 01:11:32,388
Madison.

757
01:11:40,396 --> 01:11:42,298
Easy, now, easy.

758
01:11:44,533 --> 01:11:46,535
Don't do it, kid.

759
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,343
Madison, no.

760
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,626
Oh! Wha...

761
01:12:11,627 --> 01:12:13,629
No!

762
01:12:17,366 --> 01:12:18,934
Let's go.

763
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,638
Which car is it?

764
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:53,195
I want you to watch
the pendulum.

765
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:00,034
Empty your mind.

766
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:02,203
There is nothing
but the pendulum

767
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:04,739
and the sound of my voice.

768
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:07,141
You see nothing else.

769
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:11,447
You feel nothing else,
just the pendulum.

770
01:14:12,681 --> 01:14:18,886
Back and forth.

771
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:22,623
Your eyelids are feeling heavy.

772
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:26,561
You feel yourself
drowning in the darkness.

773
01:14:26,562 --> 01:14:28,763
Let go, Madison.

774
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:33,935
Let your body sink deeper...

775
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,170
and deeper.

776
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:38,539
I'll count down from five.

777
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:42,677
When I reach one,
you will be asleep.

778
01:14:42,678 --> 01:14:44,045
Five.

779
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:46,180
Watch the pendulum.

780
01:14:46,181 --> 01:14:47,849
Four.

781
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,617
Hear my voice.

782
01:14:49,618 --> 01:14:50,785
Three.

783
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:53,788
Your body is sinking.

784
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,656
Two.

785
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,725
One.

786
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:04,532
Hello?

787
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:07,768
Where are you?

788
01:15:07,769 --> 01:15:10,905
I'm in the office.

789
01:15:10,906 --> 01:15:14,610
Go to the door and
tell me what you see.

790
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:52,147
I'm in the morgue.

791
01:16:00,155 --> 01:16:02,990
This is important.

792
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:06,794
I need you to find the Sandman.

793
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:09,597
I don't want to.

794
01:16:09,598 --> 01:16:12,767
I'll be right here
with you, I promise.

795
01:16:12,768 --> 01:16:14,135
I can't.

796
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:18,239
I need you to find him,
so I can pull him out.

797
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,308
Do you understand me?

798
01:16:20,309 --> 01:16:22,209
Please.

799
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,278
It's important.

800
01:16:24,279 --> 01:16:26,682
Do what she says, Madison.

801
01:17:05,954 --> 01:17:07,054
Hello?

802
01:17:07,055 --> 01:17:10,058
Anyone in here?

803
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,062
He's here.

804
01:17:51,733 --> 01:17:52,901
Okay.

805
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:57,406
Okay, listen, this is important.

806
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,460
I need you to grab him.

807
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:22,129
And no matter what happens,
do not let him go.

808
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,397
I can't!

809
01:18:23,398 --> 01:18:27,202
Yes, you can, Madison, grab him!

810
01:18:33,008 --> 01:18:34,309
I got him!

811
01:18:37,846 --> 01:18:38,914
Hurry!

812
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,017
Heed these words.

813
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:44,819
When this nightmare ends,

814
01:18:44,820 --> 01:18:48,256
you will be free of
this child forever.

815
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:55,296
You will be bound to
this child no more!

816
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:58,899
I can't hold on!

817
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,269
I can't hold on anymore!

818
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,475
When I snap my
fingers, you'll awake.

819
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:08,977
Wake, Madison!

820
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,862
You okay?

821
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,531
I'm fine.

822
01:19:31,900 --> 01:19:34,302
Do you think it worked?
You think he's gone?

823
01:19:35,837 --> 01:19:36,972
You okay?

824
01:19:46,248 --> 01:19:48,083
Is something wrong?

825
01:20:23,485 --> 01:20:25,053

826
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:49,144
Claire!

827
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:52,614
Run!

828
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:54,509
Five, four, three, two, one.

829
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:16,231
Leave her alone!

830
01:22:24,105 --> 01:22:25,206
Claire!

831
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:11,752

Come on. I have an idea.

834
01:23:33,441 --> 01:23:35,510
You stay.

835
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:50,525

I was thinking maybe
somewhere new.

Hawaii?

01:26:10,665 --> 01:26:14,434
I was thinking
more like Arizona.

Which reminds me, little lady,

860
01:26:16,204 --> 01:26:18,672
we need to talk about you
going back to school.

Get some takeout?

865
01:26:29,918 --> 01:26:32,352
Can we get ramen noodles?

866
01:26:32,353 --> 01:26:36,391
Or we could splurge and get
some real Japanese food.
