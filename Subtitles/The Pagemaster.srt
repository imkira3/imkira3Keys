1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,828
Alan, every ten-year-old
is afraid of something.

3
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,498
The kid's afraid of
tuna-fish sandwiches.

4
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,375
Mercury levels in the tuna.

5
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,418
Whatever.

6
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,755
Alan, the world is a frightening
place to him right now.

7
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,129
I think we could be a
little more supportive.

8
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,927
Supportive? I'm the most
supportive father on earth,

9
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,179
but I'm running out of
supportive things to do.

10
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,640
I signed him up for Little
League, he drove everybody crazy

11
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,975
with statistics about how
you can develop tumors

12
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,144
from being hit in the
head with a ball.

13
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,691
Did you know that shin splints can
lead to blood clots in the legs?

14
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,945
Claire, he brought in a medical journal.
Nobody wanted to play after that.

15
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:20,447
And now I'm building him a tree
house, in a tree he refuses to climb.

16
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,994
You know he hates heights.

17
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:27,995
I don't know. I just want
to be a good father.

18
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,166
But you are a good father.

19
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,636
I'm OK! I'm OK!

20
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,266
Aah! No, I'm not!

21
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,152
Hey. Rich!

22
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,571
Well?

23
00:03:58,572 --> 00:03:59,947
You like it?

24
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,445
Uh, yeah, it's great, Dad.

25
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,990
Hey, how about bringing
me up that bag of nails?

26
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,574
No, come on up!

27
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:11,000
Look. Solid as a rock.

28
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,172
Dad, eight percent of all household
accidents involve ladders.

29
00:04:15,173 --> 00:04:17,757
Another three percent
involve trees.

30
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:20,586
We're looking at 11
percent probability here.

31
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:24,719
Fine. Just put the bag
in the bucket, OK?

32
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:38,194
- Rich.
- Huh?

33
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,814
Ow!

34
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,449
Oh! Oh!

35
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:46,035
Dad! Do you have
feeling in your toes?

36
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,204
Yes, I have feeling in my toes.

37
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,955
Oh, Alan, honey, are you OK?

38
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,081
Yeah, I'm fine.

39
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,501
Fine. Oh!

40
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,749
Can't argue with statistics, Dad.

41
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:59,215
Statistics. Here's
something you can do,

42
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:02,593
go down to Gutman's Hardware
Store, buy a pound of these.

43
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:03,719
But, Dad...

44
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,680
Son, you can't live your
life based on statistics.

45
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,679
You've gotta take some chances.

46
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,226
Now come on, buddy.

47
00:05:10,227 --> 00:05:12,225
You can do this.

48
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:22,524
This is not good.
Definitely not good.

49
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:52,601
- All right!
- Whoa! Good one!

50
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,354
You went further that time.

51
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,650
- All right! Way to go, dude!
- All right, line it up.

52
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,448
Hey, guys, look, it's Richie Tyler.

53
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:11,287
Hey, check out his clothes. Hey,
Tyler, where you going, the moon?

54
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,955
Get cable in that thing, Tyler?

55
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:16,667
Hey, what's the
matter, you chicken?

56
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,542
What's the matter, wuss,
forgot your training wheels?

57
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,240
Uhh!

58
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,913
Uhh!

59
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,449
No cranial damage.

60
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,461
Oh!

61
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,491
Hello?

62
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,246
Welcome to the library, young man.

63
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:03,459
Don't tell me. You're
here for a special book.

64
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,795
- Mister...
- Stop, stop, stop. Allow me to guess.

65
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,965
I have a talent for
guessing what people need.

66
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:13,427
You're in need of...

67
00:09:13,428 --> 00:09:15,304
a fantasy.

68
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,598
Brave knights,

69
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:21,935
mythical fairies,
ferocious dragons.

70
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,312
Look, all I want is...

71
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,605
Adventure!

72
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:29,068
Of course. You're a boy
who loves adventure!

73
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,320
Brimming with wicked demons,

74
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:32,905
cutthroat pirates...

75
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:34,656
No, no, that's not it.

76
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,905
Horror!

77
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:42,498
Horror! Evil demons!

78
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,085
Wretched monsters! Haunted houses!

79
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,171
Graveyards!

80
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,090
Yes.

81
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,802
It's horror for you, boy.

82
00:09:54,803 --> 00:09:57,846
I'm sure of it.

83
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,390
Your library card, please.

84
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,517
I don't have one.

85
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,016
You do now.

86
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,400
Sign here.

87
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,445
Richard Tyler.

88
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,696
Consider this your passport

89
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:23,407
to the wonderful, quite
unpredictable world of books.

90
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,290
But I don't want any books.

91
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,128
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
I only came in here 'cause of the storm.

92
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,797
You mean you don't need...

93
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,006
Oh.

94
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:35,710
I see.

95
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,844
Is there a phone where
I can call my parents?

96
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,516
Through there.

97
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,232
Proceed in a
northeasterly direction

98
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:57,030
until you get to the rotunda, and from there
head west through the fiction section.

99
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:02,783
And you'll find it. A public
telephone. You can't miss it.

100
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:16,425
Don't be afraid, boy.
If you lose your way,

101
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:21,632
merely direct yourself
back to the exit sign.

102
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:00,553
Wow!

103
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:35,880
Jeez!

104
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,601
Whoa! Oh!

105
00:13:02,824 --> 00:13:04,199
Hello?

106
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,212
Uh-oh.

107
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:33,596
Huh?

108
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,703
Oh! Uhh!

109
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:12,806
Uhh!

110
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,188
Help!

111
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:19,814
Mister, mister, where's the exit?

112
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,823
Help!

113
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:38,794
Wha...

114
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,216
Huh?

115
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:48,138
I'm... I'm a cartoon!

116
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:52,888
You... are an illustration.

117
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,811
Who... who are you?

118
00:14:57,105 --> 00:14:59,898
I am the Pagemaster,

119
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,696
keeper of the books and
guardian of the written word.

120
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,408
You're the guy from up there!

121
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,159
Where are the others?

122
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:17,499
Why, they're here,
of course! And all around.

123
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,001
Maybe you can show me the way out?

124
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:22,379
Follow me.

125
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,965
I-Is that the way?

126
00:15:24,966 --> 00:15:27,669
Oh, the only way.

127
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:35,100
Fiction, A to Z!
Where all is possible!

128
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:42,059
Where a boy's imagination can take
root and grow to incredible heights!

129
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,701
Where a boy's courage is a wind
that moves him to discovery!

130
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,004
And where your journey begins!

131
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,130
Uhh!

132
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,715
Whoa!

133
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:10,760
To find your way home,
you must face three tests,

134
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:14,682
horror, adventure and fantasy.

135
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,561
And remember this, when in doubt,

136
00:16:19,562 --> 00:16:22,606
look to the books!

137
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:24,900
Aah! How do you stop this thing?

138
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:28,111
<i>I am the ghost of Christmas past...</i>

139
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:30,610
<i>All the pirates shared a grave.</i>

140
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,791
<i>Due to the storm, all lines have
been temporarily disconnected.</i>

141
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,752
<i>Please try your call again later.</i>

142
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:46,957
Oh! Ow!

143
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:52,719
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

144
00:16:54,931 --> 00:16:59,768
Where's the son of a sea biscuit
knocked me from me crow's nest?

145
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:02,893
Where's he be? Where's he be?

146
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:09,655
So here be the lubber who knocked me on
me poop deck, and with no apologies too!

147
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,317
You fiction or nonfiction?

148
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,994
I'm... Richard. Richard Tyler.

149
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,331
- What kind of a book would that be?
- Uh, I'm not a book.

150
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:24,626
Got any proof?

151
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:26,962
See? Here's my name!

152
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:30,423
A library card!

153
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:34,128
Oh, begging your pardon, lad.
I didn't know you was a customer!

154
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,889
Uh, look, all I wanna
do is get outta here.

155
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:42,561
Of course you do, matey! We all do.

156
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:46,517
But this is a library, mate.
Not everything's as it seems.

157
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:52,862
<i>Look to the books.
Look to the books.</i>

158
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,076
You... you said you
knew the way out?

159
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:02,247
I know these waters like
the back of me hook!

160
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,622
Uh... Uh...

161
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:07,919
This way.

162
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,754
I gotta get home.

163
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,757
My parents are probably
worried sick about me.

164
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:16,177
Well, I'm afeared
I've been dry-docked

165
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:19,306
in this library far longer
than I'd like to remember.

166
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:23,059
As I sees it, you with your library
card are me ticket out of here!

167
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,728
Is it a deal, matey?

168
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:26,521
Ooh, I'm naked.

169
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,357
Uh, yeah, I guess so.

170
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,861
That's the spirit, lad!

171
00:18:32,862 --> 00:18:34,863
Can we get going now?

172
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:38,283
Aye aye! Let's scale this
mast and get our bearings!

173
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:44,205
Mast? That's a ladder. I kind
of have this thing about heights.

174
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,918
Huh. I'll take care of that.

175
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,463
<i>Mysterious Island. Yes.</i>

176
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:52,797
<i>Kidnapped.</i>

177
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:57,218
Ah, here we be! 20,000
<i>Leagues Under the Sea.</i>

178
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,423
Ah, the squid, yes, that's it!

179
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,393
It's a giant squid!

180
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,264
Ah!

181
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,107
Whoa!

182
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,651
Ohh!

183
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,027
Jump, boy!

184
00:19:14,028 --> 00:19:15,904
It's jump for your life!

185
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:19,070
Ohh!

186
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,409
Uhh!

187
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,459
Let go of my face! I can't breathe!

188
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:41,257
What are you doing, grabbing me like
that and messing up my pantyhose?

189
00:19:42,473 --> 00:19:46,267
Hmph! Now I gotta straighten out
my <i>Little Mermaid</i> underwear.

190
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,395
Who... who are you?

191
00:19:48,396 --> 00:19:50,980
I'm Fantasy. Oh!

192
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,399
I'm Fantasy! What is this?

193
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,945
Hm.

194
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,988
It's a library card.

195
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,949
I'm a book, honey. I can read.

196
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,702
Now tell me,

197
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:07,539
what's the one thing you wish for
more than anything in the world?

198
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,663
Anything in the world?

199
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,793
L-I'd like to get out of here.

200
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:16,798
I'll grant your wish, child. But you
must do me one small kindness in return.

201
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,758
You gotta check me outta here!

202
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,594
That's it? OK, let's go!

203
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:24,305
Do I have to click my
heels or something?

204
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,600
Honey, you in the wrong story.

205
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:31,229
That was a close one, lad. Lad?

206
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,984
Hold on there, missis!
The lad's with me!

207
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,279
- You know that short story?
- Yeah, he's adventure.

208
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,656
Honey, that's what they all say.

209
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:45,285
I heard that! I'll have
you know I'm a classic!

210
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:48,204
Mm-hm. A classic... misprint.

211
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:53,710
Why, you old sea serpent! I'll rip out
your pages and use them for... Oh, no!

212
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,211
Do something!

213
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:56,337
Hm.

214
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:06,014
Oops! I forgot. My wand doesn't always
work outside the fantasy section.

215
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,933
You mean you can't
wish us to the exit?

216
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:13,438
That overdue shrew's never
even seen the exit.

217
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:15,231
More than you have, shorty!

218
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:19,110
In fact, the exit's just beyond
my fantasy section. Hmph!

219
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,112
Then what are ye doing
in these parts?

220
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,573
There a witches' convention
around here, maybe?

221
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:27,869
Look, I was misshelved.

222
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,124
But that's over, now that young Prince
Charming here has come to check me out.

223
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,211
My good eye, he is.
The lad's checking me out!

224
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:39,214
Come on, boy, we're wasting
time chumming off this dinghy.

225
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:41,090
It's on to the exit for us!

226
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:45,678
If he thinks the exit's in that direction,
you know it's got to be in this one!

227
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,681
Don't listen to her, mate. She's
not sailing with a full crew!

228
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,101
Ah-ah-ah!

229
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:55,688
Fantasy! She's a bloody nightmare.

230
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:59,275
Let's leave him. He doesn't
even know where we are now!

231
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,403
Bilge water! Of course I
know where we are! We're...

232
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:06,491
<i>Hound of the Baskervilles.</i>
We're in Baskervilles.

233
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,784
Have a look-see!

234
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,577
Hm. Huh?

235
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,711
Hey, this way! Through here!

236
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,839
Nice doggy! Good doggy!

237
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,417
Hurry!

238
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,605
Oh, baby.

239
00:22:37,606 --> 00:22:39,858
Are we still in the library?

240
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,610
Aye, lad. The horror section.

241
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,863
It looks pretty scary.

242
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:49,410
That it does. Just stay close to me and...
and you got nothing to worry about.

243
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,203
Mm-hm.

244
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:08,504
There it is! The exit!

245
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:20,648
Looks like the only way to reach the
exit is through that there house.

246
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:22,817
No way I'm going in there.

247
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:26,487
It's your only chance, boy.
It's just a house.

248
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:31,194
Yeah, but 70 percent of all
accidents are household-related.

249
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:42,209
Dr. Jekyll. Mr. Hyde.
Must be a duplex.

250
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,630
Whoa!

251
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:47,210
Go ahead, matey. I'm...
I'm right behind ye.

252
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,011
Well? Ring the bell.

253
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,522
Ohh!

254
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,194
- Good catch!
- Here, take it.

255
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:09,572
Isn't he sweet?

256
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,241
Oh, I scared you.

257
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,785
I'm sorry!

258
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:16,162
You mustn't judge a
book by its cover.

259
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:19,287
Look, he's smiling!

260
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,669
That's a smile?

261
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,295
All right, teatime's over.

262
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,674
Let's start navigating this house.

263
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:30,551
Huh? No, wait! Don't go in there!

264
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,846
It's scary inside!

265
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:35,723
Ha! I ain't afeared of nothing!

266
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:36,891
I'm afraid.

267
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:37,976
Of what?

268
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,103
Or, of...

269
00:24:40,104 --> 00:24:42,146
And... Aah!

270
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,232
And...

271
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:46,356
And...

272
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,779
Uh, I know how you feel.

273
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:53,741
Horror always has sad endings.

274
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,160
I come from a world
of happy endings.

275
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,954
Why don't you come with us?

276
00:24:57,955 --> 00:25:00,999
Yeah! And maybe you could
help us through the house.

277
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,623
Through the house? Hm.

278
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,288
Uh.

279
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:06,921
You can do it.

280
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,715
'Kay.

281
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,759
Friend?

282
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,057
Oops!

283
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,103
Come on!

284
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,143
Hm?

285
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,119
He-hello?

286
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,123
A-anybody home?

287
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,639
What was that?

288
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:02,852
Nevermore!

289
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,851
Get me out of here!

290
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,659
May I assist you in some way?

291
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,453
Oh. Hello there, Mr...?

292
00:26:20,454 --> 00:26:24,079
Doctor. Dr. Jekyll.

293
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:30,505
Well, sir, we did ring the bell.

294
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:32,924
It's all my fault. I was
trying to help them

295
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:35,343
find their way to the
other side of the house.

296
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,762
The other side?

297
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:43,684
My boy, I derive no pleasure in telling
you that you are in extreme danger.

298
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:46,104
- Danger?
- Even as we speak.

299
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:52,904
Lurking in this very room, waiting
to strike, are forces of evil.

300
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,822
Wait for me! Wait for me!

301
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:10,751
Every man is possessed
of both good... and evil.

302
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,674
Oh, yes.

303
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:17,970
But enough of that.
Anyone care for a drink?

304
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,421
Hm?

305
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,225
Ah.

306
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:30,983
I'll have a go with you, doc.

307
00:27:31,817 --> 00:27:33,067
Ooh!

308
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:35,316
Stay back! This is a man's drink!

309
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:39,240
Can I have the olive?

310
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:40,488
Oh!

311
00:27:40,576 --> 00:27:41,826
Uh-oh.

312
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,779
Now look what you've done!

313
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,206
Whoa!

314
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:48,454
Ooh!

315
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:55,090
No! No, no! Don't drink it!
Don't, don't!

316
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:27,702
Dr... Jekyll?

317
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:30,082
Dr. J?

318
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:35,004
My name is... Mr. Hyde!

319
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,677
Easy, there!

320
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,486
The stairs, mateys, the stairs!

321
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,779
Ahh!

322
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:04,367
Help, master! Don't leave me!

323
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:08,496
This is no way to treat a
library book. Sanctuary!

324
00:29:08,497 --> 00:29:10,244
Sanctuary!

325
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,005
Sanctuary!

326
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,007
Honey, you got to help him!

327
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,384
But I... I...

328
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,882
Oh!

329
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:28,179
At least this wand is
good for something.

330
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,432
Come on!

331
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,693
Which way?

332
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:41,028
Down. Definitely down.

333
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,904
No, up. Definitely up! Up, up, up!

334
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:46,569
Come on!

335
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,344
What's going on?

336
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:08,472
Ghost stories.

337
00:30:10,726 --> 00:30:12,098
Ha ha!

338
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,598
Get me outta here!

339
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,067
Aah!

340
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,986
Close the door!

341
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:24,614
Whoa!

342
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,277
Down there? I... I can't.

343
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,747
Come on, boy! Even
books have spines.

344
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,248
Come, master!

345
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,076
I can do this. I can do this.

346
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,997
Aah!

347
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,624
Uhh! Uhh!

348
00:30:45,886 --> 00:30:48,846
<i>Reach deep within
yourself, Richard.</i>

349
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,431
<i>Seize the courage.</i>

350
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:51,929
Uhh! Uhh!

351
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,727
Whoa!

352
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:59,023
- Yay! You did it! You did it!
- Grand, boy!

353
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:04,484
Hooray, hooray, hooray.

354
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,653
Wow.

355
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:22,172
Do ya smell it?
Breathe it in, mateys.

356
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,925
Ha ha!

357
00:31:25,926 --> 00:31:29,178
The land of adventure!

358
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,677
Look! There's the exit!

359
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:51,239
Hey! Wait for me!

360
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:54,829
Ha ha ha!

361
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:58,124
Home, sweet home!

362
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:02,000
There's only room for one up here.

363
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:07,251
From now on, it'll
be smooth sailin'!

364
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,720
What are ya laughin' at?

365
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:15,508
Whoa!

366
00:32:16,143 --> 00:32:17,390
Uhh!

367
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,771
A boat!

368
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:24,316
Is it... safe?

369
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:29,023
I wrote the book on sailin'. In
fact, I am the book on sailin'.

370
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,575
I'm impressed.

371
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,371
We're sinking. We're going down!

372
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,039
Somebody do something!

373
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,331
Thank you.

374
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:48,417
Shove off, lads!

375
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:58,017
Jeez, the water looks
kind of choppy.

376
00:32:58,018 --> 00:33:01,597
Maybe we should've stayed
back there where it was safe.

377
00:33:10,197 --> 00:33:11,865
Whalin' men.

378
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,696
It's Cap'n Ahab, it is!

379
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:21,957
Another guy with a peg leg.

380
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:26,086
Mm-hm. Seems to be a fashion
statement around here.

381
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:29,423
- Did you see it?
- See what?

382
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,301
The devil of the deep.
The white whale.

383
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,470
- Hm?
- Moby Dick!

384
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,936
Thar she blows!

385
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:48,108
I grin at thee,
thou grinning whale!

386
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,152
He's possessed!

387
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,605
He's insane!

388
00:33:51,655 --> 00:33:53,949
He's my kind of guy!

389
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,118
Look!

390
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,037
It's headed straight for them!

391
00:34:00,121 --> 00:34:03,541
Thou damned whale!

392
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:06,835
Thus, I give up the spear!

393
00:34:13,802 --> 00:34:16,050
So, you think I scared it?

394
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:20,849
He shouldn't swim right after
eating, you know. He'll get cramps.

395
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,677
Where did he go?

396
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,812
Aah!

397
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,357
Row! Row for your lives!

398
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:54,710
Guys! Where are you?

399
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:09,976
Adventure? Boy, am I
ever glad to see you.

400
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,237
Huh?

401
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,657
All right, all right!

402
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,408
Where's Horror?

403
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:22,032
And Fantasy?

404
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,375
Where are they?

405
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,878
I searched for 'em as
much as I could, mate.

406
00:35:30,879 --> 00:35:35,550
I'm afraid... I'm afraid they've
gone below with Davy Jones.

407
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,424
No. It can't be.

408
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:49,438
You guys are the only
friends I've ever had.

409
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:55,937
She's a cruel sea, lad.

410
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,033
They gotta be out there.

411
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,487
Horror!

412
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,039
Fantasy!

413
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,251
Sharks!

414
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,833
We may be joining them other
two sooner than you think.

415
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,299
Hey, look!

416
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:23,722
Help, help! Over here!

417
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,017
Careful, mate. Not all
sharks are in the water.

418
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,641
Get us out of here!

419
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:31,939
This way! Help!

420
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:40,364
It's a good thing you
guys came along.

421
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:45,285
Ohh! We're missing two others
about his size. Did you see 'em?

422
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,739
He's all the catch we've had today.

423
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,380
Huh?

424
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,823
I knew it! It's him!

425
00:37:22,824 --> 00:37:24,074
Who?

426
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,530
The meanest, black-hearted pirate
that ever sailed the seven seas.

427
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,748
Long John Silver!

428
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,210
Just set your keel down, mate.

429
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,796
John Silver's expecting
live company.

430
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,762
Uhh!

431
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:59,151
Give the word, Cap'n Silver, sir, and
I'll show you the color of his insides.

432
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:01,696
Red! Red! They're red!

433
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,699
Stow your cutlass, Tom Morgan.

434
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,619
I want a better look
at his outsides first.

435
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,621
Long John Silver!

436
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,790
Aye, lad, the very same.

437
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:18,623
Well, seeing as how me men plucked you out
of the water like a drownin' field rat,

438
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:21,840
you'll be joinin' our happy family

439
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:25,090
as our new cabin boy.

440
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:28,722
Thanks, but I already
have a family.

441
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,641
I really should be
getting home now.

442
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,436
Oh, I think you are home.
Heh heh heh heh.

443
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:39,852
John Silver! Touch one hair on that boy's
head, and you'll be answerin' to me!

444
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,773
Well, come aboard, matey! Ha ha.

445
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,407
Uhh!

446
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:54,581
You wouldn't happen to be going
after me treasure, would you, now?

447
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,751
You ain't got any treasure
worth goin' after!

448
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,920
- No treasure?
- No treasure?

449
00:38:59,921 --> 00:39:03,173
He's lyin'! There's plenty
of treasure for all of ya!

450
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,341
Search him!

451
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,343
The boy, too.

452
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,479
Hm.

453
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,897
Why, looky here.

454
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,191
Here he be, Cap'n.

455
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,443
What might this here be?

456
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,612
Money! It's yours! Keep it!

457
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,241
- Money, he says!
- Keep it, he says!

458
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:36,164
- Hm. Library card.
- Library card?

459
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:38,750
A cabin boy don't
need no library card.

460
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,007
I'd like to get out of here!

461
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,304
Land ho!

462
00:39:50,305 --> 00:39:53,930
Land ho!

463
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,933
There she be, mateys!

464
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,477
Treasure Island!

465
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:19,291
Stay on your toes, mate. When they go
for the gold, we'll make our break.

466
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,959
Quit your squawkin'!

467
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,295
Look to the map. What's it say?

468
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,421
It's, uh, in the middle,
by the waterfall.

469
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:30,719
No, it's east by some broccoli.

470
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,721
- Give me that!
- Broccoli.

471
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:36,017
You half-wits!
It's west, by a tree!

472
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,519
East, by broccoli!

473
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,644
They're all idiots.

474
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:48,946
What sort of way is
that for bones to lie?

475
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:51,073
It ain't natural.

476
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,242
This island's haunted.
It's accursed, it is!

477
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,662
Oh, you're all yellow dogs.

478
00:40:56,663 --> 00:41:01,118
Open your eyes. The bones is the compass
pointin' the way to the doubloons.

479
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,878
It's gone!

480
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,721
Dig deeper, boys!

481
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:19,059
I say, dig deeper!
Find the treasure!

482
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:23,730
One gold piece. This is
your treasure, is it?

483
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,400
Let's kill him and eat his parrot.

484
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,068
Stand by for trouble.

485
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:31,571
We mighta known you'd
double-cross us.

486
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:36,368
Throw down your
weapons, John Silver!

487
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:39,955
Why, you pack of back-bitin' dogs!

488
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,958
You'll be regrettin'
this, George Merry.

489
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:47,539
Save your speeches.
Dead men don't bite.

490
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:55,595
16 men on a dead man's stomach...

491
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:57,931
No! No! Chest! Chest!

492
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,433
Chest! Chest!

493
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:05,939
Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum!

494
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,814
Evil spirits.

495
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,902
Sanctuary!

496
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,447
Ohh.

497
00:42:13,448 --> 00:42:15,782
Horror! You're alive!

498
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,702
Not for long. Hee hee hee hee hee!

499
00:42:18,703 --> 00:42:20,155
Aah!

500
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,865
Ohh!

501
00:42:22,707 --> 00:42:24,159
Ohh-Ohh!

502
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,085
Ahchoo!

503
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:33,213
Fantasy!

504
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:39,264
Naturally. Well, who were you
expecting, honey, the tooth fairy?

505
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,512
Get them!

506
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,845
Ha ha! At last, a good fight!

507
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:45,312
Aah!

508
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:46,560
Uhh!

509
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:48,857
Get me outta here!

510
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,243
Hey!

511
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,912
Why, you...

512
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:11,380
Uhh!

513
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:18,428
Get the boat, boy. We're
gonna be shovin' off.

514
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,097
I'm not going with you.

515
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,432
The sword, honey. Get the sword.

516
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:26,770
Don't even think it, boy.
He ain't got the heart.

517
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,733
Hyah! Uhh!

518
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,860
Stay back!

519
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,862
Avast there, laddie.

520
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:39,157
Somebody could get hurt with
that blade you got thar.

521
00:43:39,158 --> 00:43:40,951
Be careful, master.

522
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,120
In the boat.

523
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:47,207
Huh? Easy now, matey.
Easy. I'm goin'.

524
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:50,919
Right ye are.
Into the boat, aye aye.

525
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,670
Ye be a hard lad, Richard Tyler.

526
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,558
Good sailin' to ya, shipmate.

527
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:08,270
<i>15 men on a dead man's chest</i>

528
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,600
<i>Yo, ho, ho and a bottle of rum</i>

529
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:15,986
- Way to go, honey.
- Yes!

530
00:44:17,697 --> 00:44:21,322
Whew. Oh, I wish my
dad coulda seen me.

531
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,698
Boy, I thought you two were goners.

532
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:25,162
We almost were,

533
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:28,498
until this enchanting fellow
discovered he could float.

534
00:44:28,499 --> 00:44:31,501
It's hollow.

535
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:35,922
- Who's there?
- Adventure!

536
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,382
Adventure who?

537
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:41,963
What do you mean, Adventure who?
Open the blasted door, you dog-eared...

538
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:43,510
Aah!

539
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:47,431
Perfect timing.

540
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,021
I was just thanking these
guys for saving us.

541
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,359
I coulda taken the lot of 'em with
one hand tied behind me back!

542
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:59,484
That's just his way
of saying thanks.

543
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:04,452
You're welcome!

544
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,664
Ahoy, matey!

545
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,085
Aye, we're lusty adventurous men.

546
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:16,713
Go away. You don't know
what you're talkin' about.

547
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,883
L-I know I'm not your
favorite kind of book,

548
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:21,635
but I could be just like you.

549
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:23,511
You'll never be Adventure!

550
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,972
Ye ain't got the spine for it.

551
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:28,475
And take that stupid thing off!

552
00:45:28,476 --> 00:45:30,393
Sorry.

553
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:32,392
Thinks he can be a pirate!

554
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:52,959
<i>Seize the courage, Richard,
then you will reach the exit.</i>

555
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,787
I'll never get home.

556
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,414
You did good, honey.

557
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:04,344
I lost the library card.
I can't check anybody out.

558
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,388
We'll never get to the exit now.

559
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:09,763
Honey, never say "never"
around Fantasy,

560
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:14,145
because sometimes you've got to
fight to make a wish come true.

561
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:17,357
So come on. Don't quit on me now.

562
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,026
Yeah.

563
00:46:20,361 --> 00:46:23,154
Huh! That crazy hunchbook. Ahh.

564
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,733
You don't see me
pretending to be Horror.

565
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:39,921
Why are you sittin' around like a
bunch of 0l' wenches at teatime?

566
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,548
Pick one.

567
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,921
Mmm...

568
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,051
That one.

569
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:48,013
My library card!

570
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:51,599
I wrestled it away from three sharks
who was eyein' it for breakfast.

571
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,144
At no small threat
to me life, neither.

572
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:55,600
Mm-hm.

573
00:46:55,730 --> 00:46:58,940
Where's Horror? Wasn't he with you?

574
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:02,987
He was, but he, uh... I mean,
I sort of, uh... He, uh...

575
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:05,071
What did you say to him now?

576
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:08,196
Well, I, uh... I, uh...
I just, uh, uh...

577
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,576
I'll go find him.

578
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,872
Yeah, you better go find him.
And be quick about it!

579
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:16,958
Horror!

580
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,794
Horror!

581
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,588
Horror!

582
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,923
Horror.

583
00:47:33,142 --> 00:47:36,144
Hang on, mate! I'm coming!

584
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:43,815
You're lucky I was published
with a thick hide!

585
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,145
Hm?

586
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:51,201
Come back, ya jellyfish!

587
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:59,584
Speak to me, mate.

588
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:05,918
Ye had a good heart and ye
was braver than ye knew.

589
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:13,056
I... I'd walk the plank if I
thought it would bring ye back.

590
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,308
That's beautiful.

591
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,476
Huh?

592
00:48:16,477 --> 00:48:18,600
This is too cute.

593
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,480
Uhh!

594
00:48:20,481 --> 00:48:21,815
Are you OK?

595
00:48:21,816 --> 00:48:24,025
Thanks to my friend here.

596
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:26,604
Get off me!

597
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,613
Did you see that?

598
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,906
See what?

599
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,158
My wand! It's blinkin'!

600
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,952
That can only mean one thing.

601
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:35,078
The exit!

602
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:37,497
- The checkout!
- A happy ending.

Ohh!

604
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:48,042
Let's go! Come on!

605
00:48:48,676 --> 00:48:52,846
Are you sure that swizzle stick
of yours is workin' right?

606
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:53,930
Hm.

607
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,975
I don't know. Maybe
we should test it.

608
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,688

00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,241
Be careful.

656
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,243
Huh? Hm.

657
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,827
You really are a classic.

658
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,676
Mmm!

659
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:11,891
How would you like to
curl up with a good book?

660
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:16,395
Oh, me binding!

661
00:55:16,396 --> 00:55:19,023
In your dreams!

662
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,271
Ooh!

663
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:23,270
Adventure, up here!

664
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:26,989
Go on, lad! Save yourself!

665
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,368
You think a bag of hot air
is enough to stop me?

666
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:34,745
Dragon? He's more like
a dragonfly, he is!

667
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:36,450
Look out!

668
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:48,886
Uhh.

669
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:51,806
Happy birthday.

670
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:14,113
Hang on, guys! I'm coming!

671
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,372
A sword.

672
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,510
Yes!

673
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:46,228
Ha ha! That's it, boy!
Go for the gizzard!

674
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,823
Bite him, bite him!

675
00:56:56,455 --> 00:56:57,702
Aah!

676
00:56:59,708 --> 00:57:01,000
Yah!

677
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,836
- Watch out for his tail!
- You've got him on the run!

678
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:08,254
Aah!

679
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,144
I'm not scared of you!

680
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,392
Aah!

681
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,812
Aah!

682
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,692
Huh?

683
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,538
Aah!

684
00:57:42,751 --> 00:57:45,211
I gotta get out of here.

685
00:57:47,214 --> 00:57:49,792
Aah!

686
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,462
Fantasy's wand!

687
00:57:57,808 --> 00:58:01,686
This is not good.
Definitely not good at all.

688
00:58:01,687 --> 00:58:02,853
Uh-oh.

689
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,357
<i>Look to the books.
Look to the books.</i>

690
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,442
Look to the books.

691
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:10,194
Look to the books!

692
00:58:10,195 --> 00:58:13,319
<i>Alice in Wonderland.</i>

693
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,784
Off with his head!

694
00:58:16,785 --> 00:58:18,202
Sheesh!

695
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,948
Mnh-mnh.

696
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,457
Mnh-mnh.

697
00:58:24,001 --> 00:58:26,544
<i>Jack and the Beanstalk.</i>

698
00:58:26,545 --> 00:58:28,964
Yeah! This is it!

699
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,850
I hate heights!

700
00:58:47,983 --> 00:58:49,275
Aah!

701
00:58:49,735 --> 00:58:51,610
Matey!

702
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,404
He's alive!

703
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:54,652
Aah!

704
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:58,034
Come on, guys!

705
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:00,411
Uhh!

706
00:59:16,178 --> 00:59:17,344
Whew.

707
00:59:17,345 --> 00:59:19,305
Are you all right?

708
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,057
Wh... wha...

709
00:59:21,058 --> 00:59:23,886
Master, you saved us!

710
00:59:24,019 --> 00:59:26,688
That ya did, matey.

711
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:32,568
Baby, you're the greatest.

712
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,986
Mm-wah!

713
01:00:01,014 --> 01:00:02,841
Who's there?

714
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:09,514
The Pagemaster.

715
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,650
Hey! How'd you get here?

716
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:17,029
Quit it! We're in the
presence of the Pagemaster.

717
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:21,325
I know who he is! He's the
guy who did all this to me!

718
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,203
Do you have any idea
what I've been through?

719
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:25,871
Tell me.

720
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:29,542
I was nearly torn apart
by a crazy doctor.

721
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:33,003
I was made a slave by a
bunch of mangy pirates,

722
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:37,508
and eaten, got that, eaten
by a fire-breathing dragon!

723
01:00:37,509 --> 01:00:41,554
He don't mean it, my
Pagemaster. He don't mean it.

724
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:47,888
Not to mention being tossed, squashed
and scared practically to death.

725
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:51,230
Yet you stand before me.

726
01:00:52,232 --> 01:00:55,276
Well... yeah.

727
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:59,196
Think, boy! What kind of an
adventure would you have had

728
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:02,741
if I'd brought you here
with the turn of a page?

729
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,289
You prevailed over evil.

730
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:19,008
Ah, you looked Moby
Dick in the eye, boy.

731
01:01:21,303 --> 01:01:28,309
Ah, you had pirates tough, me lad, and
don't no one speak any different.

732
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,811
If I had brought you
here from the start,

733
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:35,313
you never would have found the
courage to face your own fears.

734
01:01:43,909 --> 01:01:49,866
And in doing so, you
triumph here and always.

735
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,837
Hey, is that... That's me!

736
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:59,840
That was you.

737
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,426
I'm ready to go home now.

738
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:08,342
I mean, we're ready.

739
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:14,146
The world awaits.

740
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,481
Whoa!

741
01:02:15,482 --> 01:02:17,983
Godspeed to you, boy!

742
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,687
Wait for me!

743
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,577
Aah!

744
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:00,647
You took quite a spill, young man.

745
01:03:01,528 --> 01:03:03,230
Huh?

746
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,233
Are you all right?

747
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:18,919
Careful! You'll slip again!

748
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:25,926
Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!

749
01:03:25,927 --> 01:03:28,721
Wait! Uh, I forgot something.

750
01:03:28,763 --> 01:03:31,261
Here.

751
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,185
I'm afraid you can
only check out two.

752
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:41,981
Horror? But I promised him.

753
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,905
You promised whom?

754
01:03:46,573 --> 01:03:50,027
- Look, I need... Just this once?
- Shh.

755
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:55,115
I have a talent for
guessing what people need.

756
01:03:57,083 --> 01:03:59,581
Just this once.

757
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:02,459
Shh.

758
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:56,759
Yes!

759
01:05:02,273 --> 01:05:06,148
Good. That was definitely good.

760
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:13,826
I can't imagine where he could be.
Maybe we should call the police.

761
01:05:13,827 --> 01:05:15,700
Alan!

762
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,866
He's home.

763
01:05:24,504 --> 01:05:26,505
Alan.

764
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,132
It's impossible.

765
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:38,638
Rich?

766
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,157
We probably should
put him in his bed.

767
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,531
Let's let him sleep
up here tonight.

768
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:12,260
Love you, Richie.

769
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:29,273
Good night, son.

770
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:45,327
It's dark out here. I wish
there was a night-light.

771
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:48,125
Honey, wish granted.

772
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:50,623
Ooh.

773
01:06:54,093 --> 01:06:56,387
Hooray! Hooray!

774
01:06:57,472 --> 01:07:00,390
Breathe it in, mateys.

775
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:04,971
This be the land of adventure.
You can lay to that.

776
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:14,780
Come here, handsome.
Why you cryin'?

777
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:18,781
Because I have friends.

778
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,872
That you do, matey.

779
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:27,167
Aye, that you do.

780
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,377
Ahem.

781
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:31,797
You know what would make
this a happy ending?

782
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,715
A kiss.

783
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:35,300
OK.

784
01:07:38,513 --> 01:07:40,889
I meant from her!

785
01:07:45,353 --> 01:07:47,772
<i>When this world</i>

01:07:55,989 --> 01:08:00,659
<i>For you to take</i>

01:08:00,660 --> 01:08:03,329
<i>When you find</i>

791

<i>Too many troubles on your mind</i>

01:08:08,167 --> 01:08:10,711
<i>And feel just like</i>

01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:14,128
<i>There's no escape</i>

794
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,175
<i>And it seems your heart's forgotten</i>

795
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:20,554

01:08:20,555 --> 01:08:23,348
<i>Turn a page in your soul</i>

01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:27,895

798
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:32,190
<i>Close your eyes and let your heart</i>

814
01:09:20,782 --> 01:09:22,574
<i>Remember when</i>

01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,242
<i>Remember when</i>

816
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:27,204

01:09:28,581 --> 01:09:31,291
<i>Just a wish</i>

<i>Anything could be</i>

820
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:40,759
<i>When the farthest star was one
more star you could reach</i>

821
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:43,595
<i>Take a look in your heart</i>

822
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:48,600
<i>'Cause that's where
