1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,928
I'm going to tell you a story

3
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,771
about a boy who would never grow up,

4
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,931
about the pirate who wished to kill him,

5
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,290
about the island where fairies roamed.

6
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,286
But this isn't the story
you've heard before,

7
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,763
because sometimes
friends begin as enemies,

8
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,281
and enemies begin as friends.

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,603
Sometimes to truly understand
how things end,

10
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,804
we must first know how they begin.

11
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,881
Come on.

12
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,529
I love you, my son.

13
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,131
I love you, my Peter.

14
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,844
Wakey, wakey!

15
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,844
Rise and shine!

16
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,491
Come on, now.

17
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,091
That's it. Come on.

18
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,004
Move along. Come on, quickly now.

19
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:29,491
Peter, we'll miss breakfast.

20
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,691
The heroes have risen.
They must now feed!

21
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,687
Quiet over there!

22
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,921
I said quiet!

23
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,685
Eat that up! Now.

24
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,608
I won't tell you again!

25
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,887
Where's the bacon?

26
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,487
We always have bacon rind of a weekend.

27
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,609
There's a war on, Peter. Rationing.

28
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,646
You're lucky to have any food at all.

29
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,847
Oh! Mother Barnabas, forgive me.

30
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,041
Get over there.

31
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,886
How much you wanna bet
she's nickin' all the rations?

32
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,531
Shh. She'll hear ya.

33
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,290
She's got ears like an elephant.

34
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,323
Bum like one, too.

35
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,167
Look.

36
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,209
More empty seats.

37
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,721
Nelson and Billy both got evacuated.

38
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:19,961
Lucky sods.

39
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,801
Both of them?

40
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,166
- When?
- Don't know.

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,203
When I woke up, they were both gone.

42
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,687
Off to some family in Canada
until the war's over.

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,481
I wouldn't mind goin' there.

44
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,489
Don't be daft. You gotta stay put.

45
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,489
For when our mums come fetch us?

46
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:34,727
Exactly.

47
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,770
We hunker down here. Hold the fort.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,604
Wait for the cavalry.

49
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,484
Now, get on that roof and
clean those filthy gutters.

50
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,045
Is it safe, Mother Barnabas?

51
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,964
Well, I've not tested it meself, like.

52
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,361
You know, not recently.

53
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,530
But all the necessary
paperwork is in order

54
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,007
should an orphan perish in a fall.

55
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,850
Now get up there!

56
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,891
And while you're aloft
and closer to our Lord,

57
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,128
you may reflect on your festering souls.

58
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,608
Your souls that fester as do the leaves.

59
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,327
See! I was right!

60
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,887
She's hoarding all the rations.

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,566
Where's she hiding all the grub?

62
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,491
Her office. No one's ever been in there.

63
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,808
I heard a rumor it's booby trapped.

64
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,567
Silence, I said! Quiet!

65
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,444
Everyone, down to the shelters!

66
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,005
In chaos is death!

67
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,841
- Come on.
- I don't like this.

68
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,644
Fort Knox.

69
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,371
The lair of the dragon.

70
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,560
Whoa!

71
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,806
Come here.

72
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,004
So put your hands there.

73
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,801
I need your shoe, fella.

74
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,003
- Could you just...
- Quiet!

75
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,281
Right.

76
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,970
Nineteen.

77
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,286
Twenty.

78
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,924
Peter.

79
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,001
Ugh. What a dirty old nun.

80
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,881
Ugh.

81
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,806
This is so unhygienic.

82
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,646
Why is the Virgin Mary so clean?

83
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,249
- Nibs?
- Down here!

84
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,283
Nibsy!

85
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,481
I told ya.

86
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,886
Booby trapped.

87
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,849
It's a treasure trove.

88
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,086
Flippin' heck!

89
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,491
Peter!

90
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,369
It's the records.

91
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,806
Peter!

92
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,610
It's your file.

93
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,441
Is it from your mum?

94
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,521
What does she say?

95
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,806
I can't.

96
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,246
Will you read it?

97
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,844
- I meant aloud.
- Oh.

98
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,124
"My dearest Peter.

99
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:02,608
"Everything I have done,
I have done because I love you.

100
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,447
"I long for the day that
I can come back for you

101
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,529
"and explain everything.

102
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,890
"Don't doubt me

103
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,044
"nor most importantly,
don't doubt yourself.

104
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,644
"You are extraordinary."

105
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,087
"More than you can imagine."

106
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,489
I promise that you will see me again,
in this world or another.

107
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:32,287
Come on!

108
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,882
That's my private property!
Give it back!

109
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,563
You know, Peter, every little
orphan dreams he's special.

110
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:52,409
That he'll be the one whose mother
comes a-skipping back for him.

111
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,682
But your mammy's not for skipping.

112
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,769
And why is that, hmm?

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,367
Because you're not special, Peter.

114
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,403
You're not even special

115
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,648
in your own way.

116
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:08,603
You're just a nasty little creature
abandoned by a feckless mammy

117
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,491
who's forgotten you exist.

118
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,801
Oh! You little savage!

119
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,766
Hands! The both of ya!

120
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,041
He never did nothin'!

121
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,164
He's guilty by association.

122
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,405
It is time for the pine.

123
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,005
Oi, Skinny.

124
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,643
Arnold and the twins, when did they go?

125
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,888
Me guess it were last night.

126
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,809
All the missing children,

127
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,964
all that dough hidden in her office.

128
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,730
What's Barnabas up to?

129
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,485
She's selling orphans.

130
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,210
I knew it!

131
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:52,405
I mean, is she? That's not nice.

132
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,411
But who in the world
buys orphans at night?

133
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,051
That's what we have to find out.

134
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,604
Now, come on,
let's make a plan. It'll be fun.

135
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,290
I've heard that one before.

136
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,768
Cor! Who guffed one?

137
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,481
Nibsy!

138
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,841
I never.

139
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,364
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

140
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,165
This was a stupid plan.
I'm going back to bed.

141
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,285
Come on.

142
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,965
- Night.
- Night.

143
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,850
- Nibs!
- Peter!

144
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,486
I told you it would happen tonight.

145
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,886
I was right!

146
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,970
What?

147
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,010
Head for the stairs.

148
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,805
Go!

149
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,285
Nibs!

150
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,201
Goodbye, Peter!

151
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,806
- You're comin' with me!
- Let go!

152
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,609
Peter.

153
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,761
Holy pudding!

154
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,291
Prepare to set sail!

155
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,410
We've gotta get out of here.

156
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,601
We'll have to jump.

157
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,847
I can't!

158
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,526
We have to!

159
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,926
Come on!

160
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,801
Nibs!

161
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,809
And away we go!

162
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,371
Come on!

163
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,564
Friends till death!

164
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,205
Peter!

165
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,008
Damnation. You've sunk my frigate.

166
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,680
Ma'am. Luftwaffe. Inbound.

167
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,331
Ladies.

168
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,483
Sector 6, sector 8, sector 12.

169
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,011
Incoming!

170
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,526
Spitfire!

171
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,684
- Clear the deck!
- Ready your swords!

172
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,201
Oh, come on!

173
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,849
Ma'am, regarding identification

174
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,047
of the enemy, um, aircraft,
it rather resembles a, um...

175
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,526
Spit it out, man.

176
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,166
It looks like a pirate ship, ma'am.

177
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,447
Come again?

178
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,686
Fire!

179
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,601
Whoa!

180
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,401
Get off.

181
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,931
Don't go dying.

182
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,246
You're precious cargo.

183
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,404
- Am I?
- Somebody thinks so.

184
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,484
Is it my mother?

185
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,567
Going up!

186
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,806
Whoa.

187
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,802
Get out here! You little rat!

188
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,041
Make your move!

189
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,045
Come on, hurry up!

190
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,242
Move it! Come on!

191
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,289
- Right this ship for docking.
- Haul away!

192
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,641
Come on, fellas.

193
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,289
Look! It's daylight.

194
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,561
I wanna see this!

195
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,649
- What is that?
- Move, I can't see.

196
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,811
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

197
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:09,484
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

198
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,763
Is this Canada?

199
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,646
Turn the lights out

200
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,490
It's less dangerous

201
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,603
Here we are now

202
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,444
Entertain us

203
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,325
I feel stupid

204
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,965
And contagious

205
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,605
Here we are now

206
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,603
Entertain us

207
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:29,841
Hey!

208
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,802
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

209
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,721
Sing!

210
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,167
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

211
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,531
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

212
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,166
Kneel!

213
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,010
I don't kneel to anyone.

214
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,645
Oh, you'll kneel to him.

215
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,811
He's the pirate all pirates fear!

216
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,849
The original nightmare!

217
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:59,365
The man they call Blackbeard!

218
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,805
And I forget just why I taste

219
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,209
Oh, yeah, I guess it makes me smile

220
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,046
I found it hard, so hard to find

221
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,325
Oh, well, whatever, never mind

222
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,161
Hello, hello, hello, how low?

223
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,929
With the lights out

224
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,083
It's less dangerous

225
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,010
Here we are now

226
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,929
Entertain us

227
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,446
I feel stupid and contagious

228
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,887
Sing for your master!

229
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,010
Here we are now

230
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,282
Entertain us

231
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,127
Sweet, gentle children.

232
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,408
You who weep molten pearls
of innocent tears,

233
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,606
dry them, dear nippers.

234
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,362
For I have sprung you
from life's cruel dungeon,

235
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,927
and hereby grant you liberty!

236
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,723
Suffer no more.

237
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,720
Come unto me. You are home.

238
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:18,965
Here you join orphans alike
from every corner of the globe,

239
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,402
every race, creed, and color.

240
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,481
Every age and era.

241
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,801
You are pioneers.

242
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,645
Brave creators of a new society.

243
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,329
For this, my poppets,
is a land of opportunity!

244
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,487
My justice is divine.

245
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:43,000
My laws are so simple you could
write them on a pig's ear.

246
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,480
In fact, I have.

247
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,607
Law number one, "Those who
work with bright, honest vigor

248
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,603
"will be rewarded with prizes

249
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,809
"and trophies

250
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,010
"and confectionery!"

251
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,809
Law number two,

252
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,606
"Those who fail to work hard,

253
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,282
"those who skive or malinger,

254
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:16,601
"will hereby know the brooding
majesty of my disapproval."

255
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,451
Mark me well.

256
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,965
I know no pity.

257
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,044
No second chances. I don't do mercy.

258
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,850
But remember,

259
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,481
don't forget to help yourselves

260
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:34,644
to lots and lots of jolly old fun!

261
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,121
Hey, kiddiewinks,

262
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:43,321
welcome to Neverland!

263
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,367
Put some effort into it.

264
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,245
You better find me some Pixum!

265
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,530
Harder! Work harder!

266
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,163
Uh, Sam Smiegel, supervisor.

267
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,527
No, thank you. Take it off.

268
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,888
- Whoa!
- Excuse me.

269
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,081
What are we digging for?

270
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,005
Did no one explain?

271
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,521
We are mining

272
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,522
for these little chaps.

273
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,206
Fairy dust, otherwise known as Pixum.

274
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,841
Fairies are real?

275
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,121
Mmm. They were real, yeah.

276
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,283
There were millions of them
all over the island.

277
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,726
What happened to 'em?

278
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,042
Oh, Blackbeard hunted them
into extinction.

279
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,844
- Why?
- For the fairy dust.

280
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,280
You know, the old Pixum.

281
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,567
What does he want it for?

282
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,124
I don't have no idea.

283
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,045
No one knows. No one's allowed to know.

284
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,726
Well, you best not dwell on it. Just...

285
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,931
Get a move on!

286
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,043
Real, actual fairies.

287
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,565
Hey, new kid,

288
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,329
you just got here
on a flying pirate ship.

289
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:05,131
"Real" should be a very fluid
concept for you right now.

290
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,762
Get to diggin'.

291
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,002
Give me your pick, kid.

292
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,562
Your hand's all messed up
because your blade is blunted.

293
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,243
If you keep swingin' like that,
you're gonna break your wrist.

294
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,646
I'm Peter.

295
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,566
How long have you been here?

296
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,967
Forever.

297
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,129
Do you know why they want it
so badly? The Pixum?

298
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,289
You ask too many questions, kid.

299
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,126
They kill for it.
We die for it. End of story.

300
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,243
- Thanks very much.
- Don't thank me.

301
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,000
I don't care about you.

302
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,009
I'm not your friend,
and I haven't got your back.

303
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,289
Simple as that.

304
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,331
Shoo, kid.

305
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,009
Fairy dust.

306
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,285
I found some.

307
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,481
That's mine!

308
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,681
No!

309
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,001
I found some!

310
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,328
Oi, thief! I found it!

311
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,168
Oi, small fry, button it.

312
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,361
Move!

313
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,641
Give it to me.

314
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,042
It was me! I found the fairy Pixum!

315
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,327
This bogey stole it.

316
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,646
He said he found it.

317
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,043
That means he found it. Clear?

318
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,725
Clear as the scar on your ugly face!

319
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,167
Take him to the Captain!
Disorder and verbals.

320
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:01,521
Move out of the way. Move it.

321
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,727
Get out of the way!

322
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,003
There... There is a procedure
for this, you know.

323
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,321
You're not supposed to...

324
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,204
- Shut it, Mr. Clipboard.
- Oh!

325
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,841
Let's see what Blackbeard makes
of this nasty little thief.

326
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,724
Oh, what you lookin' at?
I was tryin' my best.

327
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,207
Well, go on, then.
Back to work. Thank you.

328
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,209
Did you find the natives' camp?

329
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,368
They found us, sir.

330
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,401
They sprang from the trees and laid
waste to 40 of our most formidable men.

331
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,325
Then they disappeared back into
the forest as if they were never there.

332
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,682
- Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
- We will get them, Captain.

333
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,491
Given the proper time.

334
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,566
Time?

335
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,761
Mmm.

336
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,764
I have sucked these mines dry.

337
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,241
There's almost nothing left.
I must have their lands.

338
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,404
But these savages
continue to ambush my ships,

339
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,445
operating from some hidden camp,
which no one can seem to find.

340
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,241
And yet you assure me all will
be well given the proper time.

341
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,408
There is no time! None!

342
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,681
Oh...

343
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,241
Excuse me, Captain.

344
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,410
Hey ho.

345
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,250
The show must go on.

346
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,884
How do the miners seem?

347
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,923
Dirty, feverish,
on the brink of collapse, sir.

348
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,091
Why must it be so hard?

349
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,246
So...

350
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,649
Who are we making an example of today?

351
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,802
Hey ho, let's go!

352
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,202
Hey ho, let's go!

353
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,930
They're forming in a straight line

354
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,560
They're going through a tight wind

355
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,285
No, no!

356
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,330
What's going on?

357
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,164
What do you think?

358
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,243
They're piling in the backseat

359
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,283
They're generating steam heat

360
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,009
Pulsating to the backbeat

361
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,730
The Blitzkrieg Bop

362
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,971
Any clearer now?

363
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,248
Hey ho, let's go!

364
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:02,290
Hey ho, let's go!

365
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,169
Yeah!

366
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,481
Brave heroes of Neverland,

367
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,648
behold these traitors.

368
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,084
I entrust their fate
to your gracious whim.

369
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,809
This barbarian...

370
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,490
...caught stealing from the grain store.

371
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,966
...was caught squealing
from the grain store.

372
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,161
Stealing.

373
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,361
- Stealing.
- Twice.

374
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,601
Twice!

375
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,162
- Will you spare him?
- No!

376
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,681
Or do you lust for justice?

377
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,200
Justice!

378
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,681
- Yes!
- Justice!

379
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,366
- Do they ever have mercy?
- Oh, yes. They do.

380
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,887
Often?

381
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,121
Uh...

382
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,970
Let's go!

383
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,489
Don't answer that.

384
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,330
This boy has been
in our mines but one day

385
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,530
and has already proven himself
to be a thief,

386
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,040
a rabble rouser, and a Pixum fraudster.

387
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,367
- I never!
- I ask,

388
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,404
shall you have mercy
for the willful child?

389
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,051
No!

390
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,043
Or do ye be nasty?

391
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,366
Nasty!

392
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,046
Nasty! Nasty! Nasty!

393
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,726
Alack.

394
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,682
The people have spoken.

395
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,848
Think a happy thought.

396
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,451
I'll be darned.

397
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,200
I don't believe it! I can fly!

398
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,088
Neverland is a dream
from which you never wake.

399
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,487
Ever had that one?

400
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,841
A dreadful nightmare
you know is not real,

401
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,287
but your sleep is so heavy,

402
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,922
so deep, so delicious

403
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,087
that you just can't wake up.

404
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,490
Drowning in sleep.

405
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,084
Slow dream

406
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,609
drowning in the soft, black sea.

407
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,011
Do you know that sea, Peter?

408
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,482
It's death, boy.

409
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,169
Murmuring to you.

410
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,368
It's where we end.

411
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,649
Most of us.

412
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,491
Would you like some chocolate?

413
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,366
Childhood ain't so jolly.

414
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,641
In fact, it's rather frightening.

415
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,206
Agree?

416
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,003
Are you brave, Peter?

417
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,250
I try to be.

418
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,723
Yes, of course.

419
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,087
Are you scared?

420
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,521
Yes.

421
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,722
Have you ever flown before?

422
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,206
No.

423
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:17,962
Beyond that wall,
there are savage people.

424
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,690
They have an ancient prophecy

425
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:23,367
from when the fairy kingdoms
reigned on this island.

426
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:28,282
The prophecy tells of a boy
born of the love

427
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,404
between a fairy prince and a human girl.

428
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,642
A boy who would be
disappeared from this world

429
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:42,482
until he was old enough to return
and lead an uprising against me.

430
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,127
A boy, so says the prophecy,

431
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:51,801
who could fly.

432
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,809
Have you come to kill me, Peter?

433
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,327
I don't believe in bedtime stories.

434
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,640
"Me... Me.

435
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,603
"Huh... Eh...

436
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,920
"Er..."

437
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,525
I promise that you will see me again,

438
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,365
in this world or another.

439
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,120
"Or another."

440
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,167
Go on! Get in there!

441
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,325
"Or another."

442
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,042
- Hey, flyboy.
- Yeah?

443
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:07,363
That was some little airshow
you put on out there.

444
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,210
Could you do that again?

445
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,561
Who wants to know?

446
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,567
Of course I can fly. You saw me.

447
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,241
Hmm.

448
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,646
Good.

449
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,881
Put your ear to that wall over there.

450
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,560
Now that's the sound of a blast cap
I stuck to the other side.

451
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,842
Set to go off in 30 seconds.

452
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,410
If I fly, you'll help me find my mother?

453
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,604
I reckon she's here on the island.

454
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,042
It's not a negotiation, kid.

455
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,049
Without me, you're stuck in this cell.

456
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,049
Without me, you're stuck in these mines.

457
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,762
Okay, then we'll talk about it.

458
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,924
Just move away from that wall before
you get yourself blown up, all right?

459
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,440
- So, what's it gonna be?
- Kid!

460
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,204
Tick

461
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,441
tock.

462
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,041
Okay, we have a deal, just...

463
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,691
Flyboy?

464
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,922
Hurry! Slide down.
They'll be comin' for us.

465
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:16,411
If I'm gonna trust you,
I need to know your name.

466
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,967
It's Hook. The name's James Hook.

467
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,804
- Happy?
- No!

468
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,726
Left foot in front of the other,
put the right one in front of the other.

469
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,604
That's it. It's called walking.
Off you go. Go on.

470
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,961
Smee.

471
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,607
Well, go on, then. Carry on.

472
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:34,801
- Smee. Down here!
- Whoa.

473
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,769
Six o'clock.

474
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,166
I don't... Yes...

475
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,965
Darn it, Smee, in the basket.

476
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,805
Please don't call me Smee.

477
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:47,321
Smee, can you get me to the surface?

478
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,004
There is no use.

479
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,924
Once you're up there,
you can't get anywhere else.

480
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,009
Not today.

481
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,001
Good knowing ya.

482
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,651
You've been a true friend.

483
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,649
Someday I'll find a way to repay you.

484
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,524
Now, send us up.

485
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,167
What the heck?

486
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,681
You just said someday
you'll find a way to repay me.

487
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:25,366
Someday, not today. Get out!

488
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,206
I think that's a very
minor technicality.

489
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:30,522
Someday could be today,
if you think about it.

490
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,761
- And, moreover...
- Smee!

491
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,047
Yes.

492
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,486
That's where we're headed.

493
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,484
The Skyport.

494
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,882
We can take one of
the cable cars up to the dock.

495
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,042
Then you'll fly us to a ship.

496
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,725
Okay?

497
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,485
Huh?

498
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,410
Keep your head down, kid.

499
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,443
Go! Go!

500
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,449
See? They anchor the galleons
far enough off the dock,

501
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,523
so they're impossible to steal.

502
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,445
So you want me to fly from the
dock, over to one of the...

503
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,450
What? Speak now,
or forever hold your peace.

504
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,484
Are we meant to have stopped?

505
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,041
Whoa.

506
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,963
Heave! Heave!

507
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,644
Forget the Skyport.
You have to do it now.

508
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,649
Are you waiting for a formal invitation?

509
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,644
- Go! Now!
- I'm afraid of heights!

510
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,291
What? You can fly!

511
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,925
Yesterday was my first time.

512
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:38,005
Well, you better fly again, or we're
all gonna fall for the last time.

513
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,969
Might we bicker about this later?

514
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,446
Smee! The sword!

515
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:46,005
Yeah, that's gonna work, kid.

516
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,606
Get up there and wave it at 'em.

517
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,441
Heave!

518
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,851
That was close.

519
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,483
Do you know how to work a ship?

520
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,648
How hard could it be?

521
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,202
- Smee! The rope!
- Yes! Yes!

522
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,883
- Clear!
- Boy!

523
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,530
Whoa!

524
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,724
This is a lot harder than it looks!

525
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,725
Yeah! We're sailin' now!

526
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,365
Well, do you have anything to say?

527
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,564
I worked really hard
setting up that table.

528
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:12,240
What? Forget the table.
Pick them up later.

529
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,845
If that boy makes it to the natives,

530
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,451
you can forget any chance
of us winning this war.

531
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,681
All will be lost.

532
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,326
We'll find them, sir.
They can't have gone far.

533
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:21,642
Well, then where are they?

534
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,281
Get me that boy before the savages do!

535
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,169
Dead ahead!

536
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,001
Ahhh!

537
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,170
Smee! Get off my leg!

538
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,723
I think I'm gonna be sick!

539
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,405
The wall! The wall!

540
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,171
Somebody, please help me!

541
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,686
Turn!

542
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,131
Smee! Get the sails up!

543
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,845
We need a strong headwind
to make the jump!

544
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,481
What jump?

545
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:43,684
Home! We're gettin'
the heck off this island!

546
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,207
No-ho!

547
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:46,771
You said we'd find my mother!

548
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:50,006
I'm not leaving Neverland!

549
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,528
Well, not now, anyway!

550
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,449
Get the sails up!

551
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,926
The sails!

552
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,650
This is gonna be a little rough!

553
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:05,564
Put the sails up!

554
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,521
How many times...

555
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:55,805
I am not to be disturbed
when I'm at the Rejuvenator!

556
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,121
Yes?

557
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,006
I am sorry, Captain,
but it's about the boy.

558
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,247
Mmm-hmm?

559
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,568
The stolen ship went down
in the Neverwood.

560
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:06,841
So the boy is lost?

561
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:08,889
Yes, sir. He is a lost boy.

562
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,003
But our best men
are searching for him now.

563
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,568
I am surrounded by imbeciles.
Must I do everything myself?

564
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,802
Sir, you can't really believe
that this pipsqueak is the one.

565
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,331
He hardly seems capable.

566
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:23,406
His mother hardly seemed capable
either, and yet, here we are.

567
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,808
The deal was to help me find my mother.

568
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,929
You were gonna break it.
That's very wrong.

569
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:31,282
No, you broke the deal first.
You lied to us.

570
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:34,563
No, I fibbed. I can fly.
Just not every day.

571
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,165
Whoa!

572
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,201
Our only way off this island

573
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,482
and now it's in pieces. Satisfied?

574
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,484
Well, yes. I'm quite content.

575
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,250
'Cause I don't wanna
get off this island.

576
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,450
All the years that I've wasted
planning to get out.

577
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:57,051
All gone.

578
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:01,685
Hey! Quit messing around.
It's not safe in here.

579
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,606
Every ship has one.

580
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,847
A what?

581
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,646
A map.

582
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:12,046
What does that say?

583
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,126
"Tribal Territory."

584
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:17,930
Exactly.

585
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:21,329
The prophecy said,
"A boy would lead the tribe."

586
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,400
So what? You don't care.

587
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,843
I do. Keep going.

588
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:30,010
Well, Blackbeard thinks
the prophecy is about me,

589
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,850
which means my mum is from here,

590
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:33,565
which means the natives
might know where she is.

591
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:35,521
Are you insane?

592
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,882
Those savages would just
as soon kill you as help you.

593
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,286
- Ever met one?
- No!

594
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,527
And I don't plan to.

595
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,371
Well, they might be very nice.
I'm not afraid of 'em.

596
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,801
There's a fine line between
bravery and suicide, kid.

597
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:49,522
I'm off to go find the
Tribal Territory. Oh, goodbye!

598
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,245
He won't last an hour out there.

599
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,442
His problem. Not ours.

600
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,729
Thing is, if he was the chosen one...

601
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:59,531
If that prophecy is real,
trust me, he ain't it.

602
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,569
But if they thought he was...

603
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,525
They believed he was...

604
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:06,361
I bet they'd handsomely reward
anyone who brought him to them.

605
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,886
Well, they haven't got a ship.

606
00:47:08,080 --> 00:47:09,889
Yeah, but they could get one.

607
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,129
Who's fought the pirates
more than the natives?

608
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,681
If anyone could find a way, it's them.

609
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:41,609
Just remember, when we find
those oh-so-sweet-natured locals,

610
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,002
true or not, you tell them
you're their savior.

611
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,646
Then, we'll go
our separate ways. Got it?

612
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,402
Why would you want to leave
a place like this?

613
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,926
Where will you go?

614
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,487
I don't know. Somewhere
I'm a little higher up

615
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,444
on the food chain, for starters.

616
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:00,281
What was that?

617
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:03,290
Somethin' a little higher up
on the food chain.

618
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:12,487
Oh.

619
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,723
Oh, that is pretty, Hook.
Do you see that?

620
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,084
We got pirates tryin'
to shoot us down with cannons.

621
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:20,521
Nearly falling a thousand feet
to our deaths.

622
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:22,125
Twice. Shipwrecked.

623
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:25,409
And you see something like that
and you think to yourself,

624
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,489
"Oh, worth it."

625
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,764
Are you an orphan?

626
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,406
My ma left me. That count?

627
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,045
Well, do you remember her?

628
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:45,291
I'm not wasting tears missing
someone who never missed me.

629
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,045
Maybe she does.

630
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,925
How can you know?

631
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,326
- Do you really believe your mum's here?
- Well, she left me a note saying...

632
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:54,124
Oh, well, if she left you a note, sure.

633
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:55,526
Just 'cause yours never loved you...

634
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,721
Stop.

635
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,007
...doesn't mean my mum never loved me.

636
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,645
Stop talking right now.

637
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,371
Did you hear that?

638
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,050
It was a deafening nightmare shriek.

639
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:08,920
- How can anyone not have heard...
- Shh.

640
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,921
That's a Neverbird.

641
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,164
And so is that.

642
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,361
What're we gonna do?

643
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:48,047
We need a plan. We need a plan!

644
00:49:49,067 --> 00:49:50,884
Run!

645
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:53,326
We'll lose them in the mist! Go!

646
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:55,324
Go!

647
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,130
Run, Smee!

648
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:01,561
Their faces are terrible,
but their feathers are quite lovely.

649
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,091
Shut up and run!

650
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,560
Go!

651
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,447
Smee!

652
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,840
Peter!

653
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,962
Hook? Is that you?

654
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,046
Peter.

655
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,004
Hook, they've got Smee.

656
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,486
No.

657
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,407
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right!

658
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,208
I knew we'd find the natives.

659
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,931
We're saved.

660
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,129
Please! I'm ready
to go home now, please.

661
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,842
Let me handle this.

662
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:34,521
Good fair lady. We come in peace.

663
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:36,563
And with treasure.

664
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:39,726
May I proudly present to you...

665
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,245
Pan!

666
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:13,687
Pan!

667
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:15,041
Pan!

668
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,601
Pan! Pan!

669
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:18,967
Pan!

670
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,602
Pan! Pan!

671
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:26,287
Pan!

672
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,926
Smee!

673
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,565
- Smee!
- What?

674
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,807
What are they singing about?

675
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,325
Search me!

676
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:56,490
Pan! Pan!

677
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:02,760
What's going on? What's "Pan"?

678
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,287
The Pan is our tribe's bravest warrior.

679
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,926
It's our tradition
to grant you the chance to win

680
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:10,088
your freedom before
we kill you and your friends.

681
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,884
Kill? What do you mean, "kill"?

682
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,844
You are our sworn enemy. You're pirates.

683
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:16,407
Pirates? We're not pirates. Hold on!

684
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:21,442
The kid is the one
you've been waiting for.

685
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,241
Listen!

686
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,811
Your chance to live,

687
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,083
your fiercest fighter
against ours. Our Pan.

688
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,486
You win, you live.

689
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,603
- You lose...
- I get the idea.

690
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:37,847
Huh?

691
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:39,166
Bye for now.

692
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,604
Pan!

693
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,961
So how do we know when to start?

694
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,007
Whoa.

695
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,321
Whoa!

696
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,651
Whoa!

697
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,489
- Smee!
- What?

698
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,768
We have to tell them about my mother.

699
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,883
No one cares about your darn mother!

700
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,528
Sorry, that was a bit harsh.

701
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,287
Ahh!

702
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,566
Okay.

703
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,527
Your Highness.

704
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,569
I was hoping to get you alone.

705
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,566
Stop!

706
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:17,851
The little one.

707
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,971
He wears the Pan.

708
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,808
He's a boy that can fly.

709
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,882
I've seen it. It's terrific.

710
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:57,567
We call this the Memory Tree.

711
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,844
It was a time of war.

712
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:10,241
Blackbeard destroyed everything
in pursuit of the Pixum.

713
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:15,331
But then, the chief made a pact
with the great fairy king,

714
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,091
uniting our peoples against the pirates.

715
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:21,561
One night, the king's son,
the fairy prince,

716
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,928
found his way onto Blackbeard's ship.

717
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,849
Her name was Mary,
the love of Blackbeard's life

718
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,929
and his most prized possession.

719
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,600
Night after night,
the prince visited Mary.

720
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:36,282
But when Blackbeard discovered them,
he flew into a jealous rage.

721
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:39,729
So in order to save her,
the prince took human form.

722
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,929
But though fairies can live
many thousands of years,

723
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:49,570
in human flesh,
they can live only one day.

724
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:53,771
The prince sacrificed his life
for the girl he loved.

725
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:59,011
And the child of that love was you.

726
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:01,926
Our people helped your mother
hide you in the other world.

727
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,441
And they made you this totem,

728
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,007
so that when you returned,
we would know it was you.

729
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,606
What happened to my mother?

730
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:10,491
She returned to the Neverwood
and fought for us many years.

731
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,881
And?

732
00:58:12,080 --> 00:58:13,764
The pirates were winning the war,

733
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:16,884
and the fairies had to retreat
to a hidden kingdom.

734
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,491
They've remained there, in hiding,

735
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,729
unknown by Blackbeard until a time
when they can reemerge and fight.

736
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,406
And my mother?

737
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,803
- She's with them.
- She's alive?

738
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,127
Are you sure? I have to go to her!

739
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,010
- Please, take me now!
- No.

740
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,131
You must be patient.

741
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,560
But she's waiting for me.

742
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:46,685
The fairy kingdom is the
greatest secret of this land.

743
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,167
Our duty is to protect it.

744
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:56,250
Before we take you there, you must
prove yourself to be Mary's son.

745
00:58:56,920 --> 00:58:58,604
The one we've been waiting for.

746
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,808
When the third moon rises,

747
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:05,085
he must fly.

748
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:10,766
If he lives, he's the one.

749
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,521
One second.

750
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,926
And if he dies?

751
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:16,525
He's an imposter.

752
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:18,803
His death will be justified.

753
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:21,050
Three days!

754
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:23,929
I've got the necklace.
Isn't that enough?

755
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,360
You could've stolen it.

756
00:59:25,560 --> 00:59:27,528
But I didn't. Tell her!

757
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,285
Kid's always had that thing.

758
00:59:29,960 --> 00:59:31,086
How long have you known him?

759
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,691
- Three days.
- All my life.

760
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:35,128
The flying thing is a stupid detail.

761
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:36,685
Why can't they just see that?

762
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,360
If you don't believe, Peter,
then neither will they.

763
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,842
But if you do, they will, too.
I promise.

764
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,761
Are you who they think you are?

765
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:46,724
- I don't know.
- Hey.

766
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:50,041
They think you're their messiah,
that you're here to liberate them.

767
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:51,327
Are they right?

768
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,329
I said, I don't know!

769
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,331
Rabbits.

770
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:35,411
I believe.

771
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:39,846
I can fly!

772
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,125
If only Nibs was here.

773
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:49,531
He'd know how to help.

774
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:17,361
I believe.

775
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,606
Have you seen Smee?

776
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,286
These things they expect me to do,

777
01:01:34,480 --> 01:01:35,766
I can't do them, Hook. I've tried.

778
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:37,007
- Hey. Stop. Hey!
- I can't do the things,

779
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,326
so I can't be the one!

780
01:01:38,920 --> 01:01:39,921
Listen.

781
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,326
Hook, what the bloody hell am I?

782
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,131
You can go feeling sorry for
yourself all you want, kid.

783
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:47,649
But knowing where you're from,
that's half of knowing who you are.

784
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,769
That's more than most of us
here will ever know.

785
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,646
But you said that your mother left you.

786
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:54,411
Yeah. I lied. I do that sometimes.

787
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:55,931
It's called being a grown-up!

788
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,370
Least you know where you come from.

789
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:20,642
Born to a warrior, heir to a prince.

790
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,008
Does that mean you're the one?
I don't know.

791
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,364
I don't know if there is a "one."

792
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,731
But I do know

793
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:31,245
that if you aren't the guy,

794
01:02:34,520 --> 01:02:36,363
and you are just you,

795
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:40,571
maybe that's enough.

796
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:11,886
Where's the boy?

797
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,809
Spill the beans,
or I'll spill your blood.

798
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,400
I'll never tell.

799
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:18,851
He's right over there.

800
01:03:19,720 --> 01:03:21,449
Nope, nope. Wait, my mistake.

801
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,526
Pretty sure it's that way. No!

802
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,688
No. Right the first time.

803
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,407
Definitely, maybe definitely, this way.

804
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,005
The point is, we're very close.

805
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,051
Ready the ships. Bishop, kill him.

806
01:03:37,240 --> 01:03:39,208
No! Just wait!

807
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:40,561
Wait!

808
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:41,961
You might not wanna kill me just yet.

809
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,491
For I hold the crown jewels, you know.

810
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:44,761
- Informationally.
- Speak.

811
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:46,007
Sorry, a bit nervous.
You are quite intimidating.

812
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,201
Speak!

813
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,246
Now, you know the so-called
extinct fairy kingdom, hmm?

814
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:53,967
Speak.

815
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:16,691
Sorry.

816
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:18,684
I was just lookin' for you.

817
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:22,204
Well, you found me.

818
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,407
Don't see things like that in the mines.

819
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,651
Kinda beautiful.

820
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,568
So, do you like sunrises?

821
01:04:37,640 --> 01:04:39,130
What is it you think you're doing?

822
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,202
Well, I think it's called flirting,

823
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,487
but if you have to ask,
I might be doin' it wrong.

824
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,843
You're not like the men from my tribe.

825
01:04:51,160 --> 01:04:52,207
Thank you.

826
01:04:52,480 --> 01:04:53,845
No, they're honest.

827
01:04:54,080 --> 01:04:55,081
Oh.

828
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:57,044
- Strong. Brave.
- Brave.

829
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,241
That what you call it?

830
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,488
Letting my little buddy
take a leap to his death.

831
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:03,126
When he ceases
to doubt himself, he will fly.

832
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:05,521
How do we know there are any fairies
still left on this island

833
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:08,207
or that they'll come help fight
just 'cause they see him fly?

834
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:09,481
You have to trust us.

835
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:11,848
Why should we?
You certainly don't trust us.

836
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:13,201
There's a map to the fairy kingdom.

837
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:14,640
We guard it with our lives.

838
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,841
Of course there is.

839
01:05:16,040 --> 01:05:18,407
Why wouldn't there be a secret
map to the secret kingdom?

840
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,840
This isn't a game.

841
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:22,520
You've seen what Blackbeard
has done to Neverland already.

842
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:26,291
He'll reduce the rest of it to nothing
but mine pits if we don't stop him.

843
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:28,920
Has anybody ever told you
you have really beautiful eyes?

844
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:42,086
Fire on the foredeck,
prepare to come around.

845
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,201
Tiger Lily!

846
01:05:52,680 --> 01:05:53,727
You missed.

847
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:35,921
Ha-ha!

848
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,086
We must find Peter!

849
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,086
Shoot her!

850
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:24,244
- Peter!
- Where's Hook?

851
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,809
All of this because of you.

852
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:32,281
No, Kwahu, wait!

853
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,649
You're welcome. Now, come on.

854
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:49,081
Keep moving!

855
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:10,926
Well, well, well.

856
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,364
The princess, I presume.

857
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:17,646
Oh, well, actually, I'm just a miner,
but I appreciate the compliment.

858
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,086
Bishop.

859
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,686
Go on.

860
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,806
Line them up.

861
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:37,521
Down here.

862
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:49,210
All these years digging our hands raw
for tiny lumps of Pixum,

863
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:52,968
and now I learn from Mr. Smee you know
where there's a mountain of the stuff.

864
01:08:58,440 --> 01:08:59,487
Nice as pie.

865
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:05,331
Tell me where the boy is and how to find
the fairy kingdom, and you may live.

866
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,962
Death is the greatest adventure.

867
01:09:16,160 --> 01:09:17,286
Bon voyage.

868
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,843
All hail the new Chiefette.

869
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:35,205
Princess Tiger Lily.

870
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,402
All hail!

871
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:43,725
Tell him. He'll kill you.

872
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:45,447
He's right, you know.

873
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,521
Nice birdie.

874
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:05,570
- There's a map.
- Traitor.

875
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:06,761
Don't shoot her.

876
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:08,041
She told me there's a map
to the fairy kingdom.

877
01:10:08,240 --> 01:10:09,321
Traitor! How dare you betray us, pirate?

878
01:10:09,560 --> 01:10:10,846
I'm trying to save
your lives, sweetheart.

879
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:12,087
It won't happen again.

880
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,890
Oh, it won't, I guarantee it.

881
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:15,847
Captain.

882
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:20,727
Go, kid.

883
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:24,846
Yeah!

884
01:10:25,080 --> 01:10:26,411
Kill them all!

885
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:33,566
Whoa!

886
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,845
Attack. Attack!

887
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:53,000
No!

888
01:11:02,840 --> 01:11:05,241
Can I tell you something, Peter?

889
01:11:05,600 --> 01:11:07,443
You'll never find your mother.

890
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,171
Yes, I will find her.

891
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,124
No, you really, really won't.

892
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,568
You'll never find your mother.
Do you know why?

893
01:11:22,040 --> 01:11:23,246
Because I killed her.

894
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:29,161
She died at my hand. By this very blade.

895
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:31,966
As you will, too.

896
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:39,606
Close your eyes, Peter,
and think a happy thought.

897
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,365
Bad form, sir!

898
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:47,926
We have to run, now!

899
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,889
No. We have to jump.

900
01:12:10,560 --> 01:12:12,767
Peter, are you hurt?

901
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,361
Well, I'm fine, too. Thanks for asking.

902
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:16,721
Don't speak to me.

903
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:18,803
Because of you, everything my
people have fought to protect

904
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:20,331
- will be destroyed.
- Hey...

905
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:21,885
Because of you, the Chief is dead.

906
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,923
- Smee was the rat.
- He was your friend.

907
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,685
- How was I supposed to know?
- You should've known.

908
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,166
- I'm sorry.
- You should've known.

909
01:12:27,360 --> 01:12:29,522
I'm sorry if I did something wrong!

910
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:33,965
Where's Peter?

911
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:37,281
Peter.

912
01:12:42,240 --> 01:12:43,321
You lied.

913
01:12:43,560 --> 01:12:45,483
- You all lied.
- I'm sorry.

914
01:12:45,720 --> 01:12:46,767
So, it's true?

915
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:49,250
It's complicated.

916
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,442
Is my mother alive or isn't she?

917
01:12:52,920 --> 01:12:54,490
Blackbeard spoke the truth.

918
01:12:56,240 --> 01:12:57,241
And you lied to me.

919
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,444
Had we told you she was dead, you'd
have walked away from your destiny.

920
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:04,643
Whoever it is you think I am,
whatever it is you expect me to be,

921
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:06,771
I'm not.

922
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:08,485
And I can't.

923
01:13:11,360 --> 01:13:12,691
I couldn't...

924
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,760
I didn't wanna watch you die.

925
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:20,964
You should've closed your eyes.

926
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,845
Blackbeard won't stop
searching for Peter.

927
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:40,681
There's only one place on this island
he wouldn't dare look.

928
01:13:41,000 --> 01:13:43,765
Mermaid Lagoon? Sounds pretty.

929
01:13:45,040 --> 01:13:48,169
So pirates are afraid of mermaids?

930
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,162
Because of what we will pass
through to get there.

931
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,566
Yeah?

932
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:53,841
Crocodiles.

933
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:55,971
Afraid?

934
01:13:57,400 --> 01:13:58,640
No, ma'am.

935
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:06,882
Find the map. Keep looking.

936
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,005
Does Smee please thee?

937
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:10,281
Pull the place apart!

938
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:12,960
- So may Smee be free?
- No, you're too useful.

939
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:14,161
But Smee was promised...

940
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,089
Smee should cease to talk of
himself in the third person,

941
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,282
- or Smee will be a non-person.
- Yes.

942
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,086
I found it.

943
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,569
It's a map to the fairy kingdom.

944
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,000
Ready the ships!

945
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,685
We must get there before Peter.

946
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:31,167
Grab the torches.
They're afraid of the light.

947
01:15:36,200 --> 01:15:37,850
Did we scare 'em off?

948
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,570
Oh, come on. They can fly?

949
01:15:52,040 --> 01:15:53,610
Keep waving the torches.

950
01:16:00,240 --> 01:16:01,321
There!

951
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,445
Peter!

952
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:10,446
Peter!

953
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,246
I think I see him.

954
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,771
Where?

955
01:16:14,320 --> 01:16:16,129
- Reach for my hand!
- Help! Help!

956
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:11,486
Peter.

957
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:12,966
What happened?

958
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,524
What the heck are those?

959
01:17:16,720 --> 01:17:18,961
I don't know, but I think
you're gonna like 'em.

960
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,481
You could say that again.

961
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,561
Hey, hey, hey. Don't go.

962
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,329
- I'm gonna check it out.
- Be careful.

963
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:00,370
Who's more careful than me?

964
01:18:03,840 --> 01:18:06,684
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
what happened to your mother.

965
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:11,924
But Blackbeard didn't tell you
the whole truth either.

966
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:15,250
Let me show you.

967
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:18,606
The mermaids charged
these waters with memories.

968
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:20,731
You can see the past.

969
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:24,691
Deep breath.

970
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:35,921
There's no time.

971
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,088
Blackbeard's men nearly have us.

972
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,166
Go to the fairy kingdom. Hide.
Keep our people safe.

973
01:18:59,480 --> 01:19:01,209
You should never have come back, Mary.

974
01:19:03,080 --> 01:19:04,809
And yet, here you are.

975
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,121
Ready to die for them
rather than live with me.

976
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:25,524
No. Mary.

977
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,370
No! No.

978
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:29,562
No!

979
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,086
She was a warrior.

980
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,887
A great warrior.
Her sacrifice still inspires us.

981
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:43,640
Did you know her?

982
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,371
She trained me.

983
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:48,370
Would she have been proud of me?

984
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:50,411
Yes.

985
01:19:50,680 --> 01:19:51,841
Very.

986
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:56,768
But what if I can't do what she did?

987
01:19:57,160 --> 01:19:59,322
What if I fail to fulfill the prophecy?

988
01:19:59,520 --> 01:20:01,568
And what if you fail to try, Peter?

989
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:03,967
What are you then?

990
01:20:07,680 --> 01:20:08,841
Hey!

991
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:12,441
You've gotta see this.

992
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:16,769
Now, the hull's a little banged up.

993
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,890
And see those teeth marks?
Boy, those crocs can jump.

994
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,244
But once I get her fixed up,
she's gonna be in good shape.

995
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:24,885
For what?

996
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:26,884
To get us the hell off this island.

997
01:20:27,040 --> 01:20:28,405
You're going to run like a coward?

998
01:20:28,640 --> 01:20:31,041
Well, I never really thought
of it in those exact terms,

999
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,730
but, generally speaking, yes.

1000
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,281
And where will you go?

1001
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,088
Home. It's, you know,

1002
01:20:37,880 --> 01:20:39,962
where I come from.

1003
01:20:41,040 --> 01:20:43,042
Home's not where you come from.
It's where you make it.

1004
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:44,606
So help me do that.

1005
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,724
Anyone that survived Blackbeard's attack
is in the mine by now.

1006
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,490
And I've been there,
and I'm not going back.

1007
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:54,165
Not for anything or anyone.

1008
01:20:54,440 --> 01:20:56,920
Well, if you have
no reason to stay, then go.

1009
01:20:57,400 --> 01:20:58,561
Go now. Leave us to die.

1010
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:00,769
I don't want you to die.

1011
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:04,766
I want you to come with me.

1012
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:06,246
And if I don't?

1013
01:21:08,120 --> 01:21:11,090
Then that's your decision. Not mine.

1014
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,161
Well, kid.

1015
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,761
Looks like the old gang's back together.

1016
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,523
Let's get this ship in the air.

1017
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,284
Let's get one thing straight.

1018
01:21:46,720 --> 01:21:51,842
I'm not the chosen one, and the prophecy
wasn't about me if it was ever real at all.

1019
01:21:54,120 --> 01:21:55,963
But I am my mother's son.

1020
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:59,801
And if Blackbeard is going to destroy
everything my parents died for,

1021
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:04,125
I'll stand against him to the last.
Just like they did.

1022
01:22:06,960 --> 01:22:10,209
Now, take me to the fairy kingdom.

1023
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:45,931
It's just as the Chief described it.

1024
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:51,727
These are words.

1025
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,887
- What language is it?
- Must be fairy.

1026
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,761
I can read.

1027
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:09,521
I can read it.

1028
01:23:10,120 --> 01:23:11,246
What does it say?

1029
01:23:11,640 --> 01:23:14,564
"Only the prince
who bears the key shall pass."

1030
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:16,721
Just that.

1031
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,642
Then some boring stuff about
the great fallen dead.

1032
01:23:21,560 --> 01:23:23,210
It means we need a key.

1033
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,040
Then this was all for nothing.

1034
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:26,565
No, I wouldn't say that.

1035
01:23:28,600 --> 01:23:30,648
"The prince who bears the key."

1036
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:32,561
Don't you see, Peter?

1037
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,960
- I am the...
- You bear the key.

1038
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:37,881
I do?

1039
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,005
You've had it all along.

1040
01:23:49,440 --> 01:23:51,442
- She knew I'd come for her.
- Yes.

1041
01:23:52,080 --> 01:23:54,924
Mum tries to protect the kingdom
by giving son the key.

1042
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,611
I kill Mum, but fail to kill the son.

1043
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,609
In turn, son fails to protect the kingdom
by giving me the key.

1044
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,769
Mum would be very disappointed.

1045
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:09,760
Wouldn't she?

1046
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,644
Eternity beckons.

1047
01:24:42,280 --> 01:24:43,645
I will live forever.

1048
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:03,485
Wakey, wakey! Rise and shine!

1049
01:25:08,160 --> 01:25:09,366
That's where we're going.

1050
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,486
The fairy hive.

1051
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,571
Destroy that, and we destroy them all.

1052
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:20,001
Yes!

1053
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:23,331
Yes! Oh! Come!

1054
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:29,368
Come on. Come.

1055
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,166
Yes.

1056
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:44,725
Her name's Tinkerbell.

1057
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:46,691
I can hear her.

1058
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,451
They've been waiting for you, Peter.

1059
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:54,211
You have to get away from here!

1060
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,771
He's going to destroy you all.

1061
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,802
I know what I was meant to do,
but I failed.

1062
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:02,891
I'm sorry.

1063
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,370
I'm sorry!

1064
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,726
All right, boys, let's burn them!

1065
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:18,246
Burn them!

1066
01:26:19,560 --> 01:26:21,881
Burn them, burn them, burn them!

1067
01:26:27,640 --> 01:26:29,324
- Burn them all!
- No!

1068
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:37,085
Please, I'll do anything!

1069
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:40,920
- Please!
- Oh, don't beg.

1070
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,401
Anything.

1071
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,410
No. It's bad form to beg.

1072
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,924
Where's your sense of honor, boy?

1073
01:26:53,600 --> 01:26:54,761
Now, kneel.

1074
01:26:56,640 --> 01:26:57,801
I said kneel!

1075
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,441
I am the son of a warrior and a prince.

1076
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,205
I will never bow to you.

1077
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:07,605
If you're gonna kill me,
then get on with it.

1078
01:27:07,960 --> 01:27:09,007
As you wish.

1079
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,486
You don't have to do this.

1080
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,126
No.

1081
01:27:12,440 --> 01:27:14,204
But I really want to.

1082
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:21,965
Did you miss me?

1083
01:27:23,640 --> 01:27:24,971
Why is it always him?

1084
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:50,801
Jump!

1085
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,648
You came back!
I thought you didn't care!

1086
01:28:00,040 --> 01:28:02,168
Like I said, sometimes I lie.

1087
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,367
Come on!

1088
01:28:09,760 --> 01:28:12,081
I can't let Blackbeard get to the hive!

1089
01:28:15,680 --> 01:28:17,011
Hard to port!

1090
01:28:35,360 --> 01:28:36,521
Mind if I cut in?

1091
01:29:09,080 --> 01:29:10,127
We've gotta help her!

1092
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:11,726
Take the wheel!

1093
01:29:18,160 --> 01:29:20,242
You're gonna get this puppy
as close to them as you can.

1094
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,568
- Okay!
- And I'll jump across!

1095
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,091
Hold on!

1096
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,531
Captain!

1097
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:12,121
No.

1098
01:31:13,240 --> 01:31:14,287
Peter, no!

1099
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,161
No.

1100
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,046
It's over, boy.

1101
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:47,041
Come.

1102
01:33:15,640 --> 01:33:17,165
You! Grab that girl!

1103
01:33:43,680 --> 01:33:44,761
Pan!

1104
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:52,280
I can fly!

1105
01:33:52,520 --> 01:33:53,681
Look at me, Hook, I'm flying!

1106
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,729
All right, you don't have to
crow about it.

1107
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,046
Whoa!

1108
01:33:57,280 --> 01:33:59,851
Crow all you want! Just don't drop me!

1109
01:34:09,360 --> 01:34:10,407
Go on.

1110
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:32,643
If we're gonna beat him,
we're gonna do it together.

1111
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:34,451
Do you hear me?

1112
01:34:36,440 --> 01:34:37,601
Good!

1113
01:34:37,960 --> 01:34:39,405
Now, come on, then.

1114
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:47,721
Fire!

1115
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:17,006
Ready?

1116
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,126
Go!

1117
01:36:25,840 --> 01:36:27,046
Got you!

1118
01:36:33,760 --> 01:36:35,046
Think a happy thought.

1119
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:55,920
No!

1120
01:36:56,120 --> 01:36:57,406
Boy!

1121
01:37:13,360 --> 01:37:14,600
Hello

1122
01:37:47,080 --> 01:37:48,241
Peter.

1123
01:37:55,960 --> 01:37:57,246
Peter.

1124
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:01,646
Mum?

1125
01:38:03,160 --> 01:38:05,083
You found me.

1126
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:06,806
I have your eyes.

1127
01:38:07,600 --> 01:38:09,523
You have my heart.

1128
01:38:11,320 --> 01:38:13,926
I've imagined this moment
my whole life, and now...

1129
01:38:15,320 --> 01:38:17,971
I love you, Mum. So much.

1130
01:38:18,680 --> 01:38:21,604
I don't know how you can miss
someone you've never met,

1131
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,001
but I've missed you every day.

1132
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:25,440
Every day?

1133
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,444
Without you, I'm lost again.
What do I do now?

1134
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:31,281
You're not lost.

1135
01:38:33,000 --> 01:38:34,650
You are home.

1136
01:38:35,120 --> 01:38:37,168
On this island, with these people.

1137
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:38,961
Your people.

1138
01:38:39,320 --> 01:38:40,685
Your family.

1139
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,970
You must never give up on them,
as you never gave up on me.

1140
01:38:45,680 --> 01:38:46,841
But, Mum,

1141
01:38:47,960 --> 01:38:49,803
I don't want to lose you again.

1142
01:38:50,160 --> 01:38:51,810
You'll never lose me.

1143
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:55,246
I'll always be part of this Neverland.

1144
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:57,650
And a part of you.

1145
01:38:59,040 --> 01:39:01,407
I love you, my son.

1146
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:03,526
My Peter.

1147
01:39:04,400 --> 01:39:06,004
My Peter Pan.

1148
01:40:07,920 --> 01:40:09,410
Peter.

1149
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:17,607
Peter?

1150
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:19,930
You thought I'd leave you here.

1151
01:40:20,240 --> 01:40:22,163
- No, I never.
- Feel like some fun?

1152
01:40:22,480 --> 01:40:23,720
Yes, please.

1153
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,286
All right, gentlemen.

1154
01:40:52,600 --> 01:40:54,090
- Hold on tight.
- Peter!

1155
01:40:54,600 --> 01:40:55,647
You don't have a rope.

1156
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:58,162
We have a lot to talk about.

1157
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,520
I thought you were leaving.

1158
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:24,849
Change of heart.

1159
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:29,963
Will you take the wheel, please?

1160
01:41:42,400 --> 01:41:44,209
You don't want to go home?

1161
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,240
I already am.

1162
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:01,684
Is he a pirate, too?

1163
01:42:02,320 --> 01:42:03,321
No.

1164
01:42:06,000 --> 01:42:07,161
Not yet, anyway.

1165
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,081
Which way shall we go?

1166
01:42:12,360 --> 01:42:13,407
- Set a course!
- Set a course!

1167
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:14,886
Hey, who's in charge here?

1168
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:16,206
Well, I'm the captain.

1169
01:42:16,360 --> 01:42:17,407
And I'm the chosen one.

1170
01:42:17,680 --> 01:42:19,921
We'll have plenty of time
to argue about that later, flyboy.

1171
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:22,282
Suit yourself, Captain Hook.

1172
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:26,407
Set a course.

1173
01:42:28,280 --> 01:42:31,204
Second to the right
and straight on till morning.

1174
01:42:38,400 --> 01:42:40,050
Neverland!

1175
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:44,362
Neverland!

1176
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,722
We'll always be friends, Hook. Won't we?

1177
01:42:54,880 --> 01:42:57,486
Always. What could possibly go wrong?

1178
01:42:58,305 --> 01:43:58,309
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
