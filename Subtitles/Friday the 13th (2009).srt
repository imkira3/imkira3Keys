Come here. Come here now.

00:01:47,097 --> 00:01:49,463
You're the last one.

4
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:52,195
I've killed all the others.

5
00:01:52,235 --> 00:01:55,736
It'll be easier for you
than it was for Jason.

6
00:01:55,739 --> 00:01:57,468
Why are you doing this?

7
00:01:57,469 --> 00:02:01,132
You need to be punished
for what you did to him.

8
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:04,296
- I didn't do anything.
- You let him drown.

9
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:09,277
- Jason was my son.
- I didn't do anything.

10
00:02:10,925 --> 00:02:13,960
No. No. No. Please.

11
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,856
You should have been watching him.

12
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:20,854
Every minute.

13
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,100
Jason.

14
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,940
My special, special boy.

15
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,743
They must be punished, Jason,
for what they did to you.

16
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:17,035
For what they did to me.

17
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,350

WADE: I'm serious.

19

fuck up. I'm calling bullshit.

- WADE: Richie's calling bullshit.

24
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,110
- I'm not bullshitting.
- RICHIE: Bullshit.

25

one more time for Daddy?

- Yeah, Daddy does like it. A lot.

Whitney? Where are you right now?

32
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:15,713
- I'm here.
- Are you?

33
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,950
I'm here. Right in the
middle of nowhere.

- No, we're not, act...
- Yes.

39
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:41,781
No, we're not. Not everything
shows up on GPS, Richie.

40
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,534
A sign said there was a mine
here. Did that come up?

41
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,577
No. We're close, I think.

42
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,330
You think? Dude, you don't
know how to use this thing.

43
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,499
It's almost dark. Do
you know where it is?

44
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,294
Look, I didn't plant
this shit, Richie, okay?

45
00:04:54,295 --> 00:04:57,380
I got this tip from a secondhand
source. We should be close.

46
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,507
Look, we're gonna stop here.

47
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:03,261
Tomorrow morning, you and me, we get
up at dawn. We go, we find the crop.

48
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:06,347
We cut down as much as we can.
We ditch it in the truck.

49
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,516
- Back here before breakfast, okay?
- Hey.

50
00:05:08,517 --> 00:05:10,977
- Guys. Guys.
- Nobody knows a thing.

51
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,855
There's a perfect spot here.
It's already been cleared.

52
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,858
Perfect. We'll camp here.

53
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:20,570
Hey. Do you know how much money
we're gonna make selling this weed?

54
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:24,574
- A lot of fucking money.
- Yeah, okay? So listen to me. Relax.

55
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,326
- I am. You wanna know why?
- Why?

56
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:28,286
- You know what rich people do?
- What?

57
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:30,872
They relax. You need
to fucking relax.

- WADE: You need to relax.

Hey, guys. Guys.

60
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:50,516
I just found some broken-down cabins
over there. It's gotta be the old camp.

61
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,435
Who wants to go check it out?

62
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:54,729
Is this all we brought
to drink? No Heineken?

63
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,105
Fuck that Euro shit.

64

This is Pabst Blue American
Ribbon, my friend.

65

You do realize this camp was
closed down, like, 20 years ago?

66
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,449
Some woman, she went fucking nuts.

67
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,201
Killed all these counselors.

68
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,787
Blamed them for her son's
drowning. He was like...

69
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,498
deformed or retarded or something.

70
00:06:13,499 --> 00:06:15,525

72
00:06:18,337 --> 00:06:20,755
Apparently there was one survivor.

73
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:22,632
This girl...

74
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,968
she cut that lady's head
off with a machete.

75
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:27,553

76

00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:33,543
Her son, Jason...

78
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:37,047
he came back.

79
00:06:39,608 --> 00:06:41,384
He was actually there.

80
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:45,388
He watched his mom being beheaded.

81
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,991
A friend of mine, he went
to camp around here...

82
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,035
- RICHIE: Oh, jeez.
- He went to camp around here.

83
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:54,288
He said the cops came. They were
looking for that Jason guy.

84
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,233
All right, you know what?

85
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:59,085
- Don't believe me.
- RICHIE: Nobody does.

86
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,337
WADE: But I'm pretty sure,
the way the story goes...

87
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,840
the place was called
Camp Crystal Lake.

88
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:06,884
Do you know how many lakes are
probably called Crystal Lake?

89
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:10,179
It's like Crystal Geyser, Crystal
Water. Go to a supermarket.

90
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,807
Every single bottle of water
is "Crystal" something.

91
00:07:12,808 --> 00:07:14,142
- Aquafina.
- The...

92
00:07:14,143 --> 00:07:15,601
- Okay, fine.
- Okay.

93
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:19,856
The story could have happened anywhere.
It's how they get kids to shit themselves.

94
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:22,650
- How's that beer, beer-snob?
- Better than my own piss.

95
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:26,487
You can drink that, by the way. Yours,
hers, mine. I swear, piss is sterile.

96
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:29,282
- You will never drink my piss.
- That's what you think.

97
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:31,351
What about me?

98
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,981
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Mm-hm.

99
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,208
I got marshmallow on my knee.

you gotta do to survive.

to death and you were dead...

- Thank you.

teach you how to fish. Just go fishing.

00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:05,580
- Technology, right?
- See you.

473
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:08,900
- Have fun.
- Later.

474
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:12,753
Don't drive my boat.

475
00:36:12,754 --> 00:36:15,298
I'm the only one that
drives the boat, okay?

476
00:36:15,299 --> 00:36:16,966
Aye, aye, captain.

477
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,618
Damn straight.

(CHELSEA SCREAMS)

479
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:25,474
What does that say about me
that the second Trent said...

480
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:28,561
"Don't take my boat out," it
was guaranteed that I would.

481
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:30,438
It means you're a sociopath.

482
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,967
Now, what does it say about
me that I find that hot?

(KNOCKING)

484
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,184
Hi, I'm sorry to bother you, but
I'm looking for my sister and...

485
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,062
Hey.

486
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:51,026
- No luck?
- No. No, not yet.

487
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,086
- May I?
- Yeah.

488
00:36:54,087 --> 00:36:55,922
- Thank you.
- Sure.

489
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,866
She's pretty.

490
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,037
Thanks.

491
00:37:02,137 --> 00:37:04,222
Do you wanna come in for
a second, grab a drink?

492
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:06,166
Uh...

493
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,769
I don't think your boyfriend
would like that too much.

494
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,687
Don't worry. He'll be fine.

495
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:16,051
And here we have the stoned
American male, foraging for food.

496
00:37:16,944 --> 00:37:18,845
Thanks.

497
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,560
This should be interesting.

498
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,565
Hey, Trent, you remember...

499
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,942
Clay.

500
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:37,004
Yeah. Of course I remember Clay.

501
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,657
Why is he in my house?

502
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,634
Hey, new guy. Beer?

503
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:46,514
No, no. He's gotta get going.
You got flyers to pass out, right?

504
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,416
Yeah.

505
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:49,892
Right.

506
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:52,687
- Look, if you're hungry, we...
- Okay.

507
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:57,066
Look, Clay, obviously she's
just trying to be nice.

508
00:37:57,067 --> 00:38:00,569
But you can't stay here. No offense,
but this is a private party.

509
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,989
- I don't know you.
- No, you don't know me.

510
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,199
That's so funny, I just said that.

511
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,618
Like two seconds ago,
that I don't know you.

512
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,289
I would probably leave soon before
I get pissed off and, you know...

513
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,666
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

514
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,042
What happens then?

515
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:18,947
Hey, look. Take it easy, Trent, all right?
I'll just... I'll walk you out.

516
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,715
Yeah.

517
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:23,702
Jenna. Jenna, come on.
Where you going?

518
00:38:31,351 --> 00:38:33,102
JENNA: Sorry about that.

519
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:36,105
That's all right. It's
his house, you know?

520
00:38:36,106 --> 00:38:37,523
Where's your car?

521
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:40,192
I do not have a car,
but I do have her.

522
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:42,445
- Nice.
- Thanks.

523
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:46,324
- This thing runs?
- Yeah. Yeah, it runs.

524
00:38:46,325 --> 00:38:48,576
So where you off to next?

525
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:52,788
I haven't been to the other side of the
lake, so I was gonna go check that out.

526
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:56,151
- Do you want some company?
- I'd love some company.

It's a big motherfucker, huh?

528

Fuck, yeah.

00:39:48,011 --> 00:39:50,455
You hot bitch.

530
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,045
Let Daddy have a little lick.

531
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:04,844
You like that, bitch?
You know you do.

the kerosene up there.

It's just you, baby.

539

It's been a long time, Gina.

540
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:33,699
You remember that
special night we had?

541
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:36,076
You remember when you
took my virginity?

542
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,478
You're sexy.

543
00:41:37,704 --> 00:41:42,150
You're still tight as ever. I'm
gonna fucking pound you so hard.

That shit ain't fucking right,
dude. What the fuck?

You think we should take the
boat out? He's gonna find out.

550
00:42:50,068 --> 00:42:51,819
- I knew it.
- What?

551
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:56,156
You're inhibited. You talk a big game, but
inside you're just a scared little girl.

really scared? Let's do it.

00:43:07,502 --> 00:43:10,697
JENNA: So you and your
sister must be pretty close.

556
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:14,133
We were pretty close when we
were younger. We kind of drifted.

557
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:17,662
I mean, I bailed when I was 17,
and she stayed with my mom.

558
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,707
She kind of had to, I guess.

559
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,335
I don't know, she's always
been the responsible one.

560
00:43:26,229 --> 00:43:28,589
So when's the last time
you talked to her?

561
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:33,527
About six months ago. We
got in a fight, actually.

562
00:43:33,528 --> 00:43:37,698
She called and said she wanted to see
me, said she was counting on me...

563
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,450
and I never showed.

564
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,519
Excuse me.

Is that the one?
