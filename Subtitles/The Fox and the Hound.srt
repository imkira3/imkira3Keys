00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,683
You poor little fella.

3
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:44,895
It's all right.

4
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,938
Big Mama's here.

5
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:07,581
You know, you're gonna
need some caring for.

6
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,629
Now... Now, let's see, darlin'.

7
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,542
You need, um...

8
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,423
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

9
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,430
Not me. Not Big Mama, now.

10
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,187
Now I'm thinkin', though.

11
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,774
Mm-hmm. Oh, uh-huh.

12
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,899
Now... Now don't...
Don't you move, honey.

13
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,153
Big Mama's gonna be right back.

14
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,957
Good work, Boomer.
We'll get him this time.

15
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,299
Shh! I think he's in there.

16
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,967
Whew!

17
00:06:58,043 --> 00:07:00,717
Am I glad I found you boys.

18
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,799
There's no time to lose.
I need your help. Now come on.

19
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:06,226
- Come on.
- Let's go, Boomer. Come on.

20
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,350
Yeah, but... Oh, shucks.

21
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,697
Oh, poor little guy.

22
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:33,037
Don't you worry now. We're going
to find someone to look after you.

23
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,757
Hmm.

24
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,178
Hmm.

25
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,765
Hey, I think I got an idea.

26
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:55,650
OK, Boomer, now you
know what to do.

27
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,227
Yeah, leave it to me.
Leave it to me.

28
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:05,535
Who is it?

29
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,249
Well, I was sure I heard
someone knocking.

30
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,703
Oh, dear! My laundry!

31
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,751
Oh, here! Stop it!

32
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:28,596
Oh, you pesky birds!
Will you come back here?

33
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,598
Oh, stop!

34
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:38,152
Well, I wonder what
got into those birds.

35
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,066
Well, bless my soul!

36
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,570
Why, it's...

37
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,030
It's a baby fox.

38
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,533
Oh.

39
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,539
Hello, little fella.

40
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,087
I wonder where its mother is.

41
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,044
Come on, now. I'm not
going to harm you.

42
00:09:04,127 --> 00:09:07,222
Now, now. Oh, isn't that...?

43
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:11,552
Oh, my, my. You're a feisty
little rascal, aren't you?

44
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,684
There, there, now. Calm down.

45
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,564
No, I just can't leave
you out here all alone.

46
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:21,986
Oh, isn't he darling?

47
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:25,945
Now, not so fast.

48
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:29,403
Now, now, not so fast.

49
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:36,668
Oh, my. You're such
a little toddler.

50
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:42,541
Say, that's what I'm
going to call you.

51
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,960
Tod.

52
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,217
You know, Tod,

53
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:51,550
I'm not going to be
so lonesome anymore.

54
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,954
I got a surprise for
you, Chief, old boy.

55
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:21,538
Now, now, now, take it easy.

56
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:28,546
Well, how's this for a huntin' dog?

57
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:33,558
He's just a little runt
now, but he'll grow.

58
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:48,607
You may as well get
used to him, Chief.

59
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,163
He's for you to look
after from now on.

60
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:59,644
Tod, stop pestering Abigail.

61
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:05,025
Abigail, you're going to
have to be patient with Tod.

62
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,898
He's one of the family now.

63
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:17,075
Oh, of course. Now I know.

64
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,460
I declare, I never will
get my chores done.

65
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,179
Oh, mercy!

66
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:42,812
Tod! Tod, stop it!

67
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:44,935
Abigail! Abigail!

68
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,644
Oh, no! There goes my milk! Oh, no!

69
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,192
Easy, easy, Abigail.

70
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:55,446
Steady, old girl. Steady.

71
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:57,368
There, there.

72
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,038
Tod, you come here.

73
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,916
I said come here!

74
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:14,548
Just look what you've done.

75
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:26,185
Now, don't try to butter me up.

76
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,479
Oh, Tod, I just can't
stay angry with you.

77
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:36,157
You little imp. Now
run along and play.

78
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,825
Go on.

79
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,369
And try to stay out of mischief.

80
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:56,044
Hey, it's Dinky and Boomer.
Maybe they wanna play.

81
00:13:59,172 --> 00:14:00,970
Is this it, Boomer?

82
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:02,767
Sure, Dinky. This is the place.

83
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,766
I never forget a tree.
I never forget a tree.

84
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:09,520
He won't get away this time.

85
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,777
Hold it, Boomer. I think
I hear somethin'.

86
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,700
That's him, all right, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

87
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:23,326
Shh, shh. Get ready, Boomer.

88
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,375
Hey, I can hear him movin'. Listen.

89
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,418
That's funny. I don't hear nothin'.

90
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:31,788
Shh! Quiet.

91
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,795
Oh, that's him, Dinky.
That's him, all right.

92
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,301
Button your beak, will ya?

93
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,179
I'll check it out.

94
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,227
Would you look at that?

95
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:53,901
OK, Boomer, he's right... there.

96
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,944
Yikes! Watch it!

97
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:06,656
Why, you...

98
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,330
Nail him, Boomer! Sock it to him!

99
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,916
Hiya, fellas.

100
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:19,002
What ya doin'? Wanna play?

101
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:22,339
Stay outta this, kid.
This don't concern you.

102
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,511
Let him have it!

103
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:35,022
Don't let the creep get away!
You can take him, Boomer!

104
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:39,780
Give him a left! A right!
Let him have it!

105
00:15:43,234 --> 00:15:44,360
Aaah!

106
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:48,031
- Which way did he go?
- This way.

107
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,377
There he is!

108
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:08,681
What happened to ya? Golly!

109
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:12,354
Oh, shucks! I think
I bent my b-b-beak.

110
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,354
Now see what you done?
You cost us our breakfast.

111
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,686
I cost us our breakfast?
It was your fault.

112
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,363
- What are you talkin', my fault?
- Yeah, yeah.

113
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:24,113
A worm? For breakfast?

114
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,240
Yuck! Blecch!

115
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,603
Hey, there, Copper,
what ya sniff in' at?

116
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:59,231
Somethin'... I never smelled...

117
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,779
before, Chief.

118
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,447
Huh. Let me see.

119
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:08,320
Ah, shucks, that's easy.

120
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:12,327
The master's just cookin' grits and
fatback. You oughta know that.

121
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,749
Mm-mmm.

122
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:15,542
That's not what I smell.

123
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,167
I don't know, Chief.

124
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,544
It's something else.

125
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:25,049
Sonny, you got a lot of learnin' to
do about a-sniffin' and a-smellin'.

126
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,550
Hey, where you goin'?

127
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,884
I want to find out
what that smell is.

128
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,017
OK, Copper, but the master ain't
gonna like you wanderin' off.

129
00:17:35,096 --> 00:17:39,067
I won't get lost, Chief.
I can smell my way back.

130
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,690
Can't tell these young
whippersnappers anything.

131
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,513
What ya smellin'?

132
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,680
I'm on the trail of somethin'.

133
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:16,854
Trail of what?

134
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,394
I don't know yet.

135
00:18:23,394 --> 00:18:25,488
Why, it's... it's you!

136
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,655
What do you do that for?

137
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:34,990
We're supposed to do that when
we find what we've been trackin'.

138
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:36,870
I'm a fox.

139
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,247
My name's Tod. What's
your name, kid?

140
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:43,252
Mine's Copper. I'm a hound dog.

141
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,175
Gee, I bet you'd be good
playin' hide-and-seek.

142
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,173
Wanna try it, Copper?

143
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,300
Can I use my nose?

144
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,515
Sure. OK.

145
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,969
Now go ahead and close
your eyes and count.

146
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,856
One, two, three...

147
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,525
No, Copper! You can't peek!

148
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,855
- Oh.
- Now start again.

149
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:11,192
One, two, three, four,

150
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,869
five, six, seven...

151
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,494
My, my. Look at that.

152
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:21,328
A fox and a hound,
playin' together.

153
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,883
<i>When you're the best of friends</i>

154
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,434
<i>Having so much fun together</i>

155
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,855
<i>You're not even aware
you're such a funny pair</i>

156
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:44,355
<i>You're the best of friends</i>

157
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,982
<i>Life's a happy game</i>

158
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:52,362
<i>You could clown around forever</i>

159
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:56,867
<i>Neither one of you sees
your natural boundaries</i>

160
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:59,790
<i>Life's one happy game</i>

161
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,415
Copper!

162
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,462
Gee, I've gotta go.

163
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,299
<i>If only the world
wouldn't get in the way</i>

164
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:16,929
<i>If only people would
just let you play</i>

165
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,637
<i>They say you're both being fools</i>

166
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,270
<i>You're breaking all the rules</i>

167
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:28,311
<i>They can't understand</i>

168
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:33,199
<i>The magic of your wonderland</i>

169
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,912
<i>When you're the best of friends</i>

170
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,577
Copper!

171
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,585
<i>Sharing all that you discover</i>

172
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:53,465
<i>When these moments have passed
Will that friendship last?</i>

173
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:55,546
<i>Who can say?</i>

174
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:57,597
There's a way

175
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,926
<i>Oh, I hope</i>

176
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,603
<i>I hope it never ends</i>

177
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,601
Come on, Copper!

178
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:10,608
<i>'Cause you're the best of friends</i>

179
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,460
Copper, you're my very best friend.

180
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,583
And you're mine too, Tod.

181
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:32,917
And we'll always be friends
forever, won't we?

182
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,798
Yeah, forever.

183
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,051
Hey, let's go swimmin'!

184
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,553
Give me a head start
and I can beat ya!

185
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,819
Whoo!

186
00:21:57,525 --> 00:22:00,995
Dagnabit! That Copper pup's
gone and strayed off again.

187
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,697
Come on, Chief.

188
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,000
If that little rascal's gonna
make me a good huntin' dog,

189
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:07,793
he's gotta learn to mind.

190
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:16,093
Copper! Get over here!

191
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,297
Copper!

192
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,930
Uh-oh. I gotta go home.

193
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,761
Do ya have to? We're
havin' too much fun.

194
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:30,900
I gotta. He sounds awful mad.

195
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,898
I'll see ya tomorrow!

196
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:35,275
- And don't forget!
- I won't!

197
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:51,587
Hey, Copper, what happened to ya?

198
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:53,539
Why didn't you...?

199
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,250
Golly! You're all tied up.

200
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,552
Yeah, and it's no fun either.

201
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:00,925
The master says I gotta stay home.

202
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:03,884
Well, we can play around here then.

203
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,847
Oh, no. Not with old
Chief over there.

204
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:13,525
Is that him making
that awful noise?

205
00:23:13,601 --> 00:23:15,854
He keeps me awake at night.

206
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:22,739
Oh, don't go in there!
He can get awful mean!

207
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,240
He's cranky.

208
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:28,913
Gee-whillikers, is he ever big.

209
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,875
His ears isn't as big
as yours, Copper.

210
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,924
That's not the part you
gotta worry about.

211
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,546
Wow! Look at those teeth.

212
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:44,257
That's the part you
gotta worry about!

213
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,552
I'm gainin' on him.

214
00:23:47,635 --> 00:23:49,933
- He won't get away now.
- He's wakin' up!

215
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,223
Get out, Tod!

216
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:56,732
No. He's havin' a dream.
He's chasin' somethin'.

217
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,734
When I get him cornered...

218
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:04,068
It's... It's... It's
a big old badger.

219
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,746
Copper, he's chasin' a badger.

220
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:10,449
No, no, it ain't a badger.

221
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,704
It's a... It's a f...

222
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,044
It's a fox. A fox?

223
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:31,725
Run, Tod! Run!

224
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,797
Tod!

225
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:51,452
Amos Slade, you
trigger-happy lunatic!

226
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,370
Give me that gun!

227
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,290
My radiator!

228
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,626
Why, you blasted female.

229
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,429
- I'll... I'll...
- Hold it right there!

230
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:12,973
Watch it! That thing's loaded!

231
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,062
Now it ain't loaded!

232
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:25,111
Dagnabit, woman! Your thievin'
fox was after my chickens!

233
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:27,483
Rubbish and poppycock!

234
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:30,487
I don't believe it. He
wouldn't hurt a thing.

235
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:34,161
You callin' me a liar,
you muddleheaded female?

236
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,160
- I saw it happen!
- Amos Slade, that temper of yours

237
00:27:37,239 --> 00:27:39,492
is going to get you
into a lot of trouble.

238
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,827
Temper?

239
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:44,038
Temper, woman? You
ain't seen my temper!

240
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,836
If I ever catch that fox on my
property again, I'll blast him!

241
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,967
And next time, I won't miss!

242
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,932
Poor little tyke.

243
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:07,111
It's a shame I have to
keep him cooped up.

244
00:28:11,607 --> 00:28:15,202
Tod, stop looking at me like that.

245
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:17,746
It's not my fault, you know.

246
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,449
You caused a lot of
trouble yesterday.

247
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:29,629
Oh, now what are they up to?

248
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,304
Why, it looks like Amos is
going on a hunting trip.

249
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,891
A long one, from the looks of it.

250
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:40,936
Hmm. Well, good riddance!

251
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:55,989
Doggone meddlin' female,

252
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,617
shootin' up my radiator!

253
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:01,289
Dad blame it. Get goin'!

254
00:29:01,365 --> 00:29:05,962
There. Well, that's more like it.
Keep runnin', old girl.

255
00:29:08,038 --> 00:29:12,259
Well, Copper, me and old Chief are
gonna teach you all about huntin'.

256
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,679
Yes, sir. It's about time too.

257
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,387
Attaboy.

258
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:23,471
Yeah, you're gonna like trackin'
down those varmints for me.

259
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,523
Uh-uh. Get in the back, half-pint.

260
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:36,609
You gotta earn your
right to sit up front.

261
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,915
Well, boys, we're gettin'
outta here till next spring.

262
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:24,532
Tod, honey, what are
you doin' over here?

263
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,494
Gee, I just wanted to
say goodbye to Copper,

264
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,204
but I'm too late.

265
00:30:30,287 --> 00:30:33,257
Well, what did you plan to
do if you ran into old Chief?

266
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:40,013
Ah, Chief. I can outfox
that dumb old dog anytime.

267
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,386
Tod, now hold it just one minute.

268
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:45,185
Didn't you learn
anything yesterday?

269
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,228
Now you listen good, Tod,

270
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:49,898
because it's either
education or elimination.

271
00:30:51,308 --> 00:30:54,528
Now if you're so foxy and
old Chief's so dumb,

272
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:57,197
then why does that hound
get the fox on the run?

273
00:30:57,272 --> 00:31:00,697
'Cause he's got the hunter, and
the hunter's got the gun. Ka-bam!

274
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,120
Elimination. Lack of education.

275
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,750
<i>If you pal around with
that Copper hound</i>

276
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,203
<i>You'll wind up hangin' on the wall</i>

277
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,914
<i>Keep your nose to the wind
You'll keep your skin</i>

278
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:17,297
<i>'Cause you won't be home when
the hunter comes to call...</i>

279
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:23,014
Oh, Big Mama, I know Copper
would never track me down.

280
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:26,390
Why, old Copper,
he's my best friend.

281
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:28,391
Your best friend.

282
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:30,939
Now, Copper's gonna do
what he's been told.

283
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:34,018
Supposed to chase the little
old fox into the old foxhole,

284
00:31:34,101 --> 00:31:36,900
then along comes the hunter
with a buckshot load.

285
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,573
- Ka-ka-ka-bam!
- Elimination.

286
00:31:41,775 --> 00:31:43,903
Lack of education.

287
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,079
You better believe it, Tod.

288
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,031
Yes, sirree!

289
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:51,119
You mean Copper is
gonna be my enemy?

290
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,794
Hey!

291
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:56,794
Kid, you better step over
here and take a good look.

292
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,343
Why... Why, that's awful.

293
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,684
Those poor things.

294
00:32:12,806 --> 00:32:15,104
I'm sorry, Tod.

295
00:32:15,183 --> 00:32:20,110
Honey, Copper's gonna come
back a trained huntin' dog.

296
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,691
A real killer.

297
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,948
Oh, no, not my friend Copper.

298
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,995
He won't ever change.

299
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:30,324
I hope you're right, Tod.

300
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:34,002
And we'll keep on being
friends forever.

301
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,671
Um, won't we, Big Mama?

302
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:41,673
Darlin', forever is
a long, long time,

303
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:45,130
and time has a way
of changin' things.

304
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:52,365
Oh, Jiminy. It sure turned cold.

305
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,542
- I'm freezin' my b...
- Hey!

306
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:58,541
It's that fuzzy worm!
Let's get him!

307
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:00,755
Charge!

308
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,548
Hey, Dinky! Dinky,
quick! Over here!

309
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,553
I got him! I got him!

310
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:17,685
Do I look like a worm?
That's who we're after.

311
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:20,896
Come on!

312
00:34:25,272 --> 00:34:27,445
Look at that little creep,

313
00:34:27,524 --> 00:34:30,744
warm and cozy by the fire.

314
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:33,197
Let me take a look.

315
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,033
Now how do you like that guy?

316
00:34:36,116 --> 00:34:38,414
Snug as a bug,

317
00:34:39,452 --> 00:34:43,173
while we're out here freezin'
our b-b-b-beaks off.

318
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:47,378
Well, yackin' and shiverin'
ain't gettin' us anywhere.

319
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:51,840
We'll get that no-good
worm when we come back.

320
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,515
Oh, sh-sh-sh-shucks.

321
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:00,853
So long, Big Mama.

322
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,811
Yeah, we're goin'
s-s-south for the winter.

323
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:06,988
Goodbye, boys. See ya next spring.

324
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,886
Well, look who's here.

325
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,138
Oh, my goodness.

326
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,642
I'm sorry, Tod, honey.

327
00:38:28,056 --> 00:38:29,774
- I hope...
- Hiya, Big Mama.

328
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,022
We're back. We flew all the way.

329
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,024
Yeah, we did. We did.

330
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,821
Welcome home, boys!

331
00:38:35,897 --> 00:38:39,777
It's been kind of lonesome around
here without you little rascals.

332
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:42,495
Hi, fellas!

333
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,368
Hey, who's that? Who's that?

334
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,870
This can't be that
scrawny little squirt

335
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,375
we found by the fence
post, can it? Come on.

336
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,047
I... I can't believe my eyes.

337
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:56,171
Oh, it's me, all right.

338
00:38:56,251 --> 00:39:00,176
Hey, looky there. He's got
himself a real fancy collar.

339
00:39:00,255 --> 00:39:04,761
Hey, hey, hey. Just
look at this bushy tail.

340
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:07,062
Beautiful.

341
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:13,602
Aw, come on. Cut it out. You
guys are always teasin' me.

342
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,902
Hey, it's him, it's him. Squeeks.

343
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,953
We'll see ya later, kid.

344
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:26,952
We gotta take care of
some unfinished business.

345
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,623
I can't understand.

346
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:33,956
It was so healthy.

347
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,259
There. That oughta perk it up.

348
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,564
Now, where'd he go? Where'd he go?

349
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,064
He's goin' up the drainpipe!
I'll head him off.

350
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:59,398
OK, Boomer, we got him
trapped! Let him have it!

351
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,159
Aah!

352
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,914
- Did you get him?
- No, I didn't.

353
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,415
Neither did I.

354
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:16,506
Come on! Look!

355
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:27,475
A caterpillar under glass. Oh, boy!

356
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,275
- Holy!
- Smoke!

357
00:40:48,071 --> 00:40:51,826
Hey, hey, how's he do that,
Dinky? How's he do that?

358
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,883
<i>I ain't got no job
I'm a huntin' man</i>

359
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:02,961
<i>And I'd rather have
a dog than a dollar</i>

360
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:06,048
<i>So let's go banjo
ring-a-ling-a-ding-ho</i>

361
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,883
<i>Give a little hoot and a holler</i>

362
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,479
Aw, come on, Chief.

363
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,730
Just 'cause you're not sittin' up front,
that ain't no reason to be a sorehead.

364
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:19,311
Shucks, if it weren't for you,

365
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:22,318
Copper'd never have turned
into a good huntin' dog.

366
00:41:23,523 --> 00:41:25,275
Yes, sirree.

367
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:29,079
Now I got me the best
two dogs there is.

368
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,826
Right, Copper?

369
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,498
Isn't he somethin', Chief?

370
00:41:48,089 --> 00:41:50,683
Look, Big Mama! Copper's back!

371
00:41:52,427 --> 00:41:54,521
Boy, has he grown big.

372
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:57,436
Uh-huh.

373
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,564
And look at that big pile of
skins he helped track down.

374
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,196
I know, Big Mama. He's
a huntin' dog now.

375
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:07,401
You're right. And you're a fox.

376
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:12,493
Ah, that won't make any difference.
Copper's gonna be glad to see me.

377
00:42:12,572 --> 00:42:15,451
Well, honey, just don't
get your hopes too high.

378
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:19,128
Look, don't worry. I'll be careful.

379
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,127
I'll go tonight when Chief
and the hunter are asleep.

380
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,977
Boy, it's great to be back
home, isn't it, Chief?

381
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:41,109
Aw, come on, Chief. You
aren't still sore, are ya?

382
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:43,152
Hey, hey, come on. Let's scuffle.

383
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,480
We ain't scuffled in a long time.

384
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,112
Come on, Chief!
Let's have some fun!

385
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:52,162
Oh, lay off, Copper, you
overgrown pup, you.

386
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,080
Oh, let go!

387
00:42:58,159 --> 00:43:00,002
Dagnabit! Let go, I say!

388
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,206
Oh, OK, OK.

389
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,211
That was your trouble on the hunt.

390
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:07,009
Aw, come on, old-timer.

391
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09,338
You treat me like a
pup, you know that?

392
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,799
Why, I think I done real good
trackin' down them varmints for ya.

393
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:16,386
Smellin' and trackin' ain't enough.

394
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,222
You gotta think nasty.

395
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,109
OK, OK, I know.

396
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:24,606
I know.

397
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:42,127
Copper.

398
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:44,126
Hey, Copper.

399
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,503
It's me, Tod.

400
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:50,507
I thought that was you,
Tod. I heard ya comin'.

401
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:52,509
Boy, you've really grown.

402
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,636
You have too, Copper.

403
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:57,685
I saw you comin' back with
Chief and the hunter.

404
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:02,015
It's great to see ya, Tod.

405
00:44:02,098 --> 00:44:05,477
But, you know, you...
You shouldn't be over here.

406
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,188
You're gonna get us both
into a lot of trouble.

407
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,650
Hey, look, I... I just
wanted to see ya.

408
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:14,576
We're... We're still
friends, aren't we?

409
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:20,534
Tod, those days are over.

410
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,914
I'm... I'm a huntin' dog now.

411
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:34,423
You'd better get outta here
before old Chief wakes up.

412
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:38,430
Oh, Chief. He doesn't worry me.

413
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:40,432
Tod, I'm serious. You're...

414
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:43,435
You're fair game as far
as he's concerned.

415
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:52,190
It's that fox again!

416
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:01,915
Oh, no! No!

417
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,914
They're after Tod!

418
00:45:03,993 --> 00:45:06,462
After him, boys! Go get him!

419
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,692
Copper!

420
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:17,116
Copper! Copper!

421
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,622
Tod, I...

422
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,167
I don't wanna see you get killed.

423
00:46:26,242 --> 00:46:28,119
Track him down, boy!

424
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:33,132
I'll let you go this one time.

425
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:40,890
Don't lose him!

426
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:00,864
There they are! Old Chief's
got him on the run!

427
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,499
Jump, Chief! Jump!

428
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,893
Chief!

429
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:34,777
Chief?

430
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:43,027
Oh, no!

431
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:44,703
No!

432
00:47:57,166 --> 00:48:00,511
Tod, if it's the last
thing I do, I'll...

433
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:03,840
I'll get you for this!

434
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:11,980
Tod!

435
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,976
Tod? Tod!

436
00:48:18,187 --> 00:48:19,780
Oh, Tod!

437
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:22,324
Thank heaven you're safe.

438
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:44,217
Oh, poor Chief.

439
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,182
And it's all my fault.

440
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:51,182
I shouldn't have let Tod go.

441
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,776
Big Mama! Wake up! Wake up!

442
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:03,858
There's trouble!

443
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:17,338
Tod! Well, what is it?

444
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,882
What on earth?

445
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:24,428
Widow, get out here!

446
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,631
Why, Amos! What are you...?

447
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:29,513
Where is he? Where is he?

448
00:49:29,592 --> 00:49:31,515
I know he's in there.

449
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,346
Now just a minute.

450
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:37,309
You can't come bargin' onto
my property, Amos Slade!

451
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:40,520
That fox of yours
almost killed Chief,

452
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,822
and I'm gonna get him!

453
00:49:43,856 --> 00:49:47,326
You can't keep him
locked up forever!

454
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,823
<i>We met, it seems</i>

455
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:10,151
<i>Such a short time ago</i>

456
00:51:11,652 --> 00:51:14,872
<i>You looked at me</i>

457
00:51:14,947 --> 00:51:16,915
<i>Needing me so</i>

458
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:21,538
<i>Yet from your sadness</i>

459
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:24,544
<i>Our happiness grew</i>

460
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:28,844
<i>And I found out I needed you too</i>

461
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:34,930
<i>I remember how we used to play</i>

462
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:42,433
<i>I recall those rainy days</i>

463
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:47,233
<i>The fire's glow</i>

464
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:49,657
<i>That kept us warm</i>

465
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:54,862
<i>And now I find</i>

466
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,448
<i>We're both alone</i>

467
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:01,536
<i>Goodbye may seem forever</i>

468
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,919
<i>Farewell is like the end</i>

469
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:09,510
<i>But in my heart's the memory</i>

470
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:15,637
<i>And there... you'll always be</i>

471
00:53:08,060 --> 00:53:12,941
<i>Goodbye may seem forever</i>

472
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:16,948
<i>Farewell is like the end</i>

473
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:21,578
<i>But in my heart's the</i> memory

474
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:27,289
<i>And there you'll always be</i>

475
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:08,181
Hold it, sonny! Back off!

476
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,733
Consarn it! Where...? Where
do you think you're goin'?

477
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:15,063
Oh, oh, excuse me, I...
I was just trying to...

478
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,069
You barge in on somebody's
house like you own it.

479
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,116
Tarryhootin' around them woods,

480
00:55:20,192 --> 00:55:23,116
wakin' up folks in the
middle of the night.

481
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:27,120
I honestly didn't know
anybody lived here, and I...

482
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:30,294
Well, you know it now.
Now get off my property!

483
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,167
Go on! Beat it!

484
00:55:34,832 --> 00:55:38,553
I've been watching you, sir. You
can stay with me if you want to.

485
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:41,847
- That's very nice of you.
- Come with me.

486
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:11,084
She dropped that fox off
at the game preserve.

487
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,129
We'll get him. We'll get him.

488
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,776
Well, now, if you gotta
have a busted leg,

489
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,104
ah, this is the way to do it.

490
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:42,032
Good food, soft pillow,

491
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,451
warm stove.

492
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,779
Sure beats sleepin' in that barrel.

493
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:56,380
Well, now, here comes
visitors to see the invalid.

494
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:11,220
How do you like that? They
didn't even ask how I'm feelin'.

495
00:57:18,894 --> 00:57:23,274
Chief, get back in there
before I break your other leg.

496
00:57:26,902 --> 00:57:29,701
Copper, Copper, lookit here.

497
00:57:32,157 --> 00:57:35,661
Now, when that fox
comes traipsin' along,

498
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,712
suspectin' nothin'...

499
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:56,060
Tod?

500
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,567
Tod?

501
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:05,115
Oh, boy. These old wings
ain't what they used to be.

502
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:11,367
Big Mama, you better
lose a few pounds.

503
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,324
Uh-oh, uh-oh, there
he is, there he is.

504
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:16,747
Tod!

505
00:58:18,036 --> 00:58:19,754
Tod!

506
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,753
Oh, hi, Big Mama.

507
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:23,709
Oh, it's you, Vixey.

508
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:25,715
Hey, what brings you way out here?

509
00:58:25,794 --> 00:58:28,468
I'm lookin' for a fox named Tod.

510
00:58:28,547 --> 00:58:32,393
- He's new here in the forest.
- Oh, new? Um...

511
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,186
Well, what does he look like?

512
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:39,608
Oh, he's young. About your age.

513
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,189
And handsome.

514
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:45,273
Handsome? Oh, say.

515
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:48,404
Gee, uh, he sure sounds nice.

516
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,111
Uh, I'm not doing anything.

517
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,196
I'll help you find him.

518
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,909
Come on. He's gotta be
around here somewhere.

519
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,892
Wham?

520
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,478
What happened? Where am I?

521
00:59:39,493 --> 00:59:42,542
So, it's you again, hmm?

522
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,249
You barged in on me last
night, and now you...

523
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:46,424
I... I didn't mean to.

524
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:50,300
Just look at the... mess you made.

525
00:59:53,173 --> 00:59:56,347
Dagnabit, you clumsy bonehead!

526
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,474
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

527
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,555
Excuses, excuses.

528
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,358
Mr. Digger, sir? It was
so too an accident.

529
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:06,312
You keep out of this,
you walkin' pincushion.

530
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:11,317
You shouldn't be so grumpy to
someone who's new in the neighborhood.

531
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:13,948
A stranger, eh?

532
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:16,655
Why don't you go back
where you came from?

533
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,620
Wham?

534
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,966
Well, go on.

535
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,294
Get goin'. Git!

536
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,361
Aww.

537
01:00:56,444 --> 01:01:00,745
Gosh, he seems so... I don't
know, so downhearted, Big Mama.

538
01:01:00,824 --> 01:01:04,203
Well, you can't blame him, honey.

539
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:08,416
He was dropped out here and left all
alone without a friend in the world.

540
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,796
Well, maybe there's
something I could do.

541
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:12,844
You know, cheer him up.

542
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:16,469
Honey, you just said
the magic words.

543
01:01:21,511 --> 01:01:22,934
Now...

544
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:27,268
What? But Big Mama, I don't...

545
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:31,196
Darlin', don't move.
You look beautiful.

546
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,693
Thank you.

547
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,490
Mornin', Tod.

548
01:01:36,026 --> 01:01:37,369
Hello, Big Mama.

549
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,994
Last night was pretty miserable
for you, wasn't it, honey?

550
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,369
Just terrible.

551
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:45,749
Cheer up and look around.

552
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:48,501
The forest is beautiful
this morning.

553
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:51,584
After last night, nothin'
looks beautiful.

554
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,718
Wow!

555
01:01:58,506 --> 01:02:01,100
Who...? Who is that?

556
01:02:01,176 --> 01:02:03,804
Oh, just another fox.

557
01:02:05,639 --> 01:02:07,937
A lady fox.

558
01:02:08,016 --> 01:02:09,643
Golly!

559
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,779
Is she beautiful!

560
01:02:14,356 --> 01:02:16,279
I wonder what her name is.

561
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:20,613
Well, why don't you go ask her?

562
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:24,700
Yeah. Yeah, guess... Guess I will.

563
01:02:26,034 --> 01:02:29,914
I'll... I'll go up to her and I'll
say, "You're the most gorgeous...

564
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,715
The most beautiful...

565
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:38,256
Never seen anyone,
anywhere..." I'll say...

566
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,845
Hi.

567
01:02:42,509 --> 01:02:43,806
Hello.

568
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,764
- Big Mama told me, you know...
- I just happened to be...

569
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:51,693
May I call you by your first name?

570
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,193
Oh. Sure. Why not?

571
01:02:56,439 --> 01:03:00,160
Thanks, but what...?
What is your first name?

572
01:03:00,235 --> 01:03:02,658
- Vixey.
- Vixey.

573
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:04,159
Uh-huh.

574
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:08,164
My name is... is... uh, Tod.

575
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,961
Tod?

576
01:03:11,371 --> 01:03:15,171
That's a... That's
a nice name, Tod.

577
01:03:15,250 --> 01:03:18,595
It looks like that farm boy is
makin' it b-b-big with her.

578
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:21,674
Shh! Now just keep it down.

579
01:03:21,756 --> 01:03:24,384
Well, Tod, you know something?

580
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,845
This stream is just full of trout.

581
01:03:26,928 --> 01:03:29,101
Do you think you could catch one?

582
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:33,026
- One what?
- One what? Fish, silly!

583
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:35,354
Oh, oh, yeah! Oh, yeah.

584
01:03:35,437 --> 01:03:38,611
My dear young lady...

585
01:03:39,733 --> 01:03:43,829
you happen to be looking
at an expert... fisher fox.

586
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:47,874
Oh, Tod, Tod. Don't overdo it.

587
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:52,204
I know all the tricks.
In fact, I... I never miss.

588
01:03:52,287 --> 01:03:54,665
Please let him catch a fish.

589
01:03:54,748 --> 01:03:57,467
Here comes a whopper!

590
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:59,886
Now, watch closely.

591
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:10,104
Tod, do you need help?

592
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:15,186
No. No, I... I do it this way

593
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:17,691
all... all the... all the time!

594
01:04:21,441 --> 01:04:22,943
I got him.

595
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:27,702
Oh, that farm boy, he don't
know nothin' about f-f-fishin'.

596
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:29,954
He ain't gonna hook her that way.

597
01:04:30,033 --> 01:04:32,035
Oh, gosh!

598
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:36,168
Tod, you're the funniest
thing I ever saw!

599
01:04:36,247 --> 01:04:40,218
Go ahead! Go ahead and laugh!

600
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,921
You're like everyone
else around here.

601
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:48,014
I'm sorry. I can't help it.
You are so funny.

602
01:04:48,093 --> 01:04:51,188
So I can't fish!

603
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,230
You're a silly,

604
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:56,560
empty-headed... female!

605
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,020
Now just a minute.

606
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,947
I mean, you've got a nerve.
Why don't you grow up?

607
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:06,073
Tod, that's no way
to talk to Vixey.

608
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:10,453
Oh, raspberries! I've had it.

609
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,829
Honey, don't stay mad.

610
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:18,293
You gotta be natural. That's
the trick. Can't you see?

611
01:05:18,373 --> 01:05:23,630
<i>When you have a natural attraction</i>

612
01:05:23,632 --> 01:05:29,309
<i>You deserve a mutual reaction</i>

613
01:05:29,384 --> 01:05:32,137
<i>You're gonna get a whole lot</i>

614
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,349
<i>Of satisfaction</i>

615
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:40,487
<i>Here's all you gotta do</i>

616
01:05:40,562 --> 01:05:42,485
<i>When you feel that</i>

617
01:05:42,564 --> 01:05:47,161
<i>Natural affection</i>

618
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:52,207
<i>Leads you in the positive direction</i>

619
01:05:52,282 --> 01:05:55,331
<i>You gotta stop showin' off</i>

620
01:05:55,410 --> 01:05:57,788
<i>Start showin' up</i>

621
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:01,717
<i>With little old natural you</i>

622
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:08,219
<i>Yes, you gotta appreciate the lady</i>

623
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:13,725
<i>And now that is a natural fact</i>

624
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:18,892
<i>'Cause when you be yourself</i>

625
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:23,863
<i>With the lady, yeah</i>

626
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:29,991
<i>You gonna get appreciated</i>

627
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:32,948
<i>Right back</i>

628
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:45,927
Shh.

629
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,928
- But Big Mama...
- It's just getting interesting.

630
01:07:01,392 --> 01:07:03,315
Tod, I...

631
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:06,568
I just know you're
gonna love the forest.

632
01:07:06,648 --> 01:07:08,992
Listen, come on. Let
me show you around.

633
01:07:09,067 --> 01:07:10,694
Sure.

634
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:13,033
Come on.

635
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:31,472
Look. One, two, three,
four, five, six.

636
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:35,219
Seven.

637
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:41,183
I think six would be just right.

638
01:07:42,267 --> 01:07:43,519
Six?

639
01:07:46,813 --> 01:07:48,736
Six what?

640
01:08:30,440 --> 01:08:32,488
"No hunting."

641
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:37,869
Well, now, we ain't gonna do
none of that, are we, Copper?

642
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:41,542
We're just gonna get
us a no-good fox.

643
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,461
All right, boy, get trackin'.

644
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:49,167
Smell him out.

645
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:55,108
What ya got there, Copper?

646
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,572
Good work, boy.

647
01:10:00,655 --> 01:10:03,909
He'll be comin' right through
here, headin' for water.

648
01:10:04,492 --> 01:10:06,961
But he won't be drinkin' any.

649
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:22,427
What a beautiful morning, Vixey.

650
01:10:22,510 --> 01:10:24,808
You know, I've never been happier.

651
01:10:24,887 --> 01:10:26,981
Oh, Tod, me too.

652
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,661
That does it.

653
01:10:39,736 --> 01:10:42,159
Amos, you crafty old coot.

654
01:10:43,740 --> 01:10:46,539
The devil himself couldn't
have done no better.

655
01:10:52,123 --> 01:10:53,750
Tod?

656
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,086
- Tod, wait a minute.
- What is it, Vixey?

657
01:10:56,169 --> 01:10:59,423
I don't wanna go in
there. It's too quiet.

658
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:01,348
Oh, Vixey.

659
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,225
What?

660
01:11:13,019 --> 01:11:14,942
Tod, be careful.

661
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:01,530
Dad blast it! He's gettin' away!

662
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:03,407
Quick, Vixey!

663
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:12,120
Go on, head for the burrow.

664
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:51,284
Quick, Vixey. Out the back.

665
01:12:57,582 --> 01:12:58,583
Tod!

666
01:13:05,631 --> 01:13:07,599
Oh, no, Tod.

667
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:27,737
Cooper! Copper!

668
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:31,996
We got 'em now for sure.
This is their only way out.

669
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,169
Steady, boy. Steady. Get ready.

670
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:37,292
Tod!

671
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,123
We're trapped!

672
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,384
Tod, I'm scared.

673
01:13:45,463 --> 01:13:48,763
Quick, Vixey! This
is our only chance!

674
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:52,520
Whoa! No! I don't believe it!

675
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,895
Copper, we've trapped him now!

676
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,088
Ow!

677
01:15:11,549 --> 01:15:13,222
Copper!

678
01:15:49,170 --> 01:15:50,968
Tod!

679
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:55,888
Tod?

680
01:18:17,318 --> 01:18:20,868
Come on, Copper. Get outta the way.

681
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,164
Well...

682
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,205
come on, boy.

683
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:09,412
Let's go home.

684
01:20:24,486 --> 01:20:27,410
Shh, Shh. This is it.

685
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:29,491
We got him for sure now.

686
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:34,163
Oh, my g-g-gosh!

687
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,248
- Whoa!
- Yoww!

688
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,716
What happened?

689
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:43,509
Hey, there's somethin'

690
01:20:43,589 --> 01:20:47,560
very familiar about
those eyes, Dinky.

691
01:20:51,305 --> 01:20:53,683
Nah, it couldn't be.

692
01:20:55,309 --> 01:20:57,107
Could it?

693
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,159
Bye, Squeeks. Bye.

694
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:09,160
Good luck, honey.

695
01:21:16,372 --> 01:21:20,093
Ouch! You're killin' me! Ouch!

696
01:21:21,335 --> 01:21:24,464
Amos Slade, will you hold still?

697
01:21:24,546 --> 01:21:26,389
You're behaving like a child.

698
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:29,765
Well, for gosh sakes, you're
hurtin' my foot, woman!

699
01:21:29,843 --> 01:21:33,598
- Nonsense! Your foot is mendin' fine.
- Ow!

700
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,603
You'll soon be yourself.

701
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:39,653
Oh, land sakes. I don't
know if I like that.

702
01:21:41,688 --> 01:21:45,613
Ow! Be careful! Ouch!

703
01:21:45,692 --> 01:21:50,823
He's sure makin' a big fuss
over a little old hurt leg.

704
01:22:07,923 --> 01:22:09,516
<i>Copper?</i>

705
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:14,271
<i>You're my very best friend.</i>

706
01:22:14,346 --> 01:22:16,565
<i>And you're mine too, Tod.</i>

707
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:20,736
<i>And we'll always be friends
forever, won't we?</i>

708
01:22:20,811 --> 01:22:22,654
<i>Yeah, forever.</i>

708
01:22:23,305 --> 01:23:23,826
