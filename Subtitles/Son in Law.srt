1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

00:00:15,516 --> 00:00:21,189
* yee-Ee
yee-Ee **

3
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,903
as your principal,

4
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:39,707
I watched you all start out
here at lincoln high...

5
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:43,043
Caterpillars in our cocoon
of stability.

6
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:47,081
Over the last four years,
your chrysalis has hardened.

7
00:00:47,115 --> 00:00:50,951
And now if i listen closely,

8
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:53,721
I can almost hear
your cocoons opening.

9
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:57,191
I see before me
monarch butterflies...

10
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:00,728
Ready to take off into
that great adventure...

11
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,131
That i like to call "life."

12
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:07,268
and now...

13
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:10,271
I'm proud to present
your valedictorian...

14
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:12,706
Rebecca warner.

15
00:01:15,843 --> 00:01:18,246
Rebecca! Whoo!

16
00:01:18,279 --> 00:01:22,116
Today i would like
to talk about change.

17
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,285
It's all around us.

18
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:29,056
Change. It happens
whether we want it or not.

19
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:32,960
Change.
Are we ready for it?

20
00:01:32,993 --> 00:01:35,229
I think so.

21
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:38,932
We are poised
and prepared for the future,

22
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:42,170
Ready to embrace new people,
places and ideas.

23
00:01:44,205 --> 00:01:48,075
In short, we are ready
for the challenge of life.

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,145
Ladies and gentlemen, take a good look at us.
wake up!

25
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:55,048
We are the future.
We are the lincoln tigers.

26
00:01:59,153 --> 00:02:03,023
Hear us roar!
Whoo! We did it!

27
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:06,260
i give you the class of 1993!

28
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:08,262
Rebecca!
Zack, get up.

29
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,264
Why don't you let me take the picture?
No, no, no, dad, i'll take it.

30
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,300
Don't worry about it.
All right, okay. Do what you want.

31
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,968
Hold still there. Rebecca!
Give me that camera, walter.

32
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:17,104
If we wait much longer,
it will be my graduation.

33
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,106
Travis, would you please take our picture?
Come on!

34
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,041
Oh, yeah.
Mom, where do you want me?

35
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:24,111
Now look here, travis,
you ever work one of these? Come on, dad!

36
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:27,881
Just a minute, please.
In my day, all ya did was push a button.

37
00:02:27,915 --> 00:02:30,117
In his day, dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Okay, walter,

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,221
We're ready. Look,
i'm just tryin' to get a good one, damn it.

39
00:02:33,254 --> 00:02:35,856
Mom, it's fine.
It will be fine.

40
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,193
All right, all right, is everybody ready?
Yes!

41
00:02:39,227 --> 00:02:42,296
All right, everybody say, "cheese."
Cheese!

42
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,033
travis, did you press
that little thing...

43
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:49,237
California is a long way
off just to go to school.

44
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:52,906
Are you sure you don't wanna
reconsider state? no, dad.

45
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,810
You know i wanna do this.
Yeah.

46
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:59,146
Oh. Rebecca.

47
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,849
I-I'm not sure
that i've...

48
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:04,418
Really prepared you for what
you're gonna run into out there.

49
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:08,222
What i mean is...

50
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:10,358
The boys are different
than they are here.

51
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,860
They, um, uh...

52
00:03:12,893 --> 00:03:16,029
W-W-What i'm tryin'
to say is that the...

53
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:19,400
Well, the lifestyle's
a lot faster.

54
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:23,036
- Are you tryin' to tell me not to have sex, dad?
- Huh?

55
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,172
Daddy.

56
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,174
I'll be fine.

57
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:30,177
You know me.
well, it's, uh...

58
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,914
It's pretty late.
Uh, guess we'll get a little shut-Eye, huh?

59
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:36,984
Yeah.
Okay.

60
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,153
Good night.
Good night.

61
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:03,411
Travis?
What?

62
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:06,280
Slow down.
Why?

63
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:10,284
'Cause i-I want it
to be right.

64
00:04:10,318 --> 00:04:15,289
Well, when's it gonna be right?
You're leaving tomorrow.

65
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:17,958
You act like
it's forever.

66
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:21,228
Well, i'm not gonna see you
for three months.

67
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,131
What if everything changes?

68
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:27,267
Nothing is going
to change.

69
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,338
I'll go to school,
you'll work at the co-Op...

70
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:34,475
And we'll see each other
every single vacation.

71
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,978
And when i'm done,

72
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,315
We'll be together.

73
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,885
Promise?
Promise.

74
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,288
Okay.

75
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:50,924
I guess i can wait.

76
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,961
Now... where were we?

77
00:04:57,398 --> 00:05:01,869
That's no way to pack a truck, junior.
These bags should be back there.

78
00:05:01,902 --> 00:05:04,938
Oh, come on, dad. I know what i'm doin'.
All right, all right.

79
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:08,141
But don't come cryin'
to me when my granddaughter's clothes...

80
00:05:08,175 --> 00:05:11,144
Are scattered all up and down the highway.
Watch your hands.

81
00:05:11,178 --> 00:05:13,714
Zack, where's your sister?
What?

82
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:16,984
I don't know. Maybe she's
still in the barn with...

83
00:05:17,017 --> 00:05:19,987
zack.
What?

84
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,321
rebecca! Let's go!
Just a minute.

85
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:24,024
Okay!

86
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:37,705
Learn a lot, shortcake!

87
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:40,307
how long 'til
we get there?

88
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,143
two days, zack,
so you might as well relax.

89
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,212
shit.
what did you say?

90
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:48,315
I said, "shoot."
Hmm, walter, isn't that the long way?

91
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,018
you wanna drive? I'm sorry.
I'm trying to help.

92
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:53,020
next stop,
sunny california.

93
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:56,323
Stop!
I'm doin' the drivin' here, connie.

94
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:04,331
all freshman must report
for registration by 6:00 p.M.

95
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,168
If you don't register,
you don't exist.

96
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,170
quit it, you little...
i don't have to.

97
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,205
Fine, i'm ignoring you now.
if you kids don't shut up,

98
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:15,108
I'm gonna turn this car around.
We're gonna go right back home.

99
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:19,146
you don't have to freak, dad.
Speaking of freaks, hey, how ya doin'?

100
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:24,418
look at that idiot.
great school, rebecca.

101
00:06:24,452 --> 00:06:26,420
You need a lobotomy to get in here?
Shut up!

102
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:28,422
Don't say
shut up.

103
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,124
Coming through!

104
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:34,227
Oh, my god. We're never
gonna get through here.

105
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,797
- Zack, come on.
- Zack, do your share.

106
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,434
- I'm not a bellboy.
- Hey, pick up the trunk!

107
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:43,771
Mom...
walter, don't you yell at him in public!

108
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:47,274
- Your father's a little out of his element.
- Can we just go to my room?

109
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:49,977
I'll take the trunk.
Connie!

110
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,946
- You take this or you're not going to disneyland.
- What?

111
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,416
Wait a minute, will ya?
Wait a minute! I can do it.

112
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:01,054
Look at them two.
They're fresh off the farm, aren't they?

113
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:04,157
**

114
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,326

115
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,962
Hey, hey, hey, come on now.
Stop fighting, please!

116
00:07:08,996 --> 00:07:12,132
**

117
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:14,768
excuse us.

118
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,170
Hey, t.J.!
Watch out!

119
00:07:18,472 --> 00:07:21,809
Excuse me, dude.
Excuse me. Goddamn!

120
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,179
Rebecca, come on.
Let's just keep movin', everybody. Come on.

121
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:34,121
This is the, uh, opportunity that
you wanted for your daughter?

122
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,156
This is it.

123
00:07:37,357 --> 00:07:40,994
Go! Shut up.
Zack, okay, that's it.

124
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,131
God!

125
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,767
Zack, be care...
Ohh! Mom!

126
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,003
Oh, here they are.

127
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,305
At least she's gonna be across the
hall from somebody who's in charge.

128
00:07:52,339 --> 00:07:57,344
Sensible white cotton briefs, rebecca.
Must be a real thrill seeker.

129
00:07:57,377 --> 00:08:00,013
Zack. Zack!
Would you just stop it, both of you! Stop it!

130
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:02,149
Hey, hey.

131
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:05,285
Oh, honey, look how
wrinkled everything is.

132
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,455
- Now this is underwear.
- Zack!

133
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:12,693
Stay out of her drawer.
Oh, zack, can you gimme the key, please?

134
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:15,328
I don't have it. What do you mean?
I told you to bring it.

135
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:18,365
Damn it, zack, i swear,
i think your brain produces...

136
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:23,303
- A chemical that blocks out my voice.
- Excuse me, i can't hear you.

137
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,239
Stop it!

138
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,843
Hi. I'm carol.
I'm your new roommate. Roommate. Hi.

139
00:08:29,877 --> 00:08:33,881
I know you two are just gonna
be the best of friends. Mom.

140
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:36,316
Well, i'll leave you two
to get acquainted.

141
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,320
Ah! Hi, i'm rebecca.
I, uh...

142
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,857
I think there's some law
that says your family's...

143
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:47,427
Supposed to embarrass you on the first
day of school. I think it's murphy's.

144
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,330
I'm sorry.
My family's the same way.

145
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:55,202
Hey, carol, phone!
Ah, communal living. Excuse me.

146
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:57,871
Oh, bye-Bye.

147
00:08:57,905 --> 00:09:01,408
- What a nice girl.
- So guess that's it, huh?

148
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:05,779
Nope, nope. I gotta find a screwdriver
so i can get this trunk open for ya.

149
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:19,459
**

150
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:21,895
Hello?

151
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,167
Hello?

152
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:30,738
Anybody home?

153
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:34,141

Ah, i'm sorry.

156
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:46,319
Oh, no, no, no. I-I-I need
to borrow a real screwdriver...

157
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:49,289
Uh, to open my...

158
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:52,926
Uh, uh, my, uh,

159
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,831
Oh, you have a daughter.
Ha! Is she hot?

160
00:09:57,865 --> 00:10:00,834

161
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:05,172
My name's crawl.

across the hall from that, uh,

167
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,789
That, that thing over there!
Who?

168
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:25,192
- I told you i didn't like this coed business.
- Calm down, walter.

169
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:28,361
Hey! Oh.

170
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:32,265
Rebecca, everyone,
i'd like you to meet my girlfriend lisa.

171
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:35,335
Hi.
hi.

172
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,672
Nice to meet you.
I'm really sorry about that.

173
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:41,675
- Aren't you, zack?
- speak for yourself.

174
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,711
Well, i'm sure
i'll see you again soon.

175
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:47,881
- Yeah.
- And i'll see you next weekend.

176
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,231
Oh, dad. Dad, do you have
your camera handy? Ohh!

177
00:11:04,264 --> 00:11:08,869
Now you just remember. If you don't like
this damn place, you can go to state.

178
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:11,972
She's gonna love it, walter.
Aren't you, dear?

179
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:14,875
- You guys, i'll be fine.
- Stay out of trouble, okay?

180
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,977
I will as long as you
stay out of my room.

181
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,213
Oh, and give your roommate
a big kiss for me.

182
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:23,250
In the shower.
Get in the car, zack.

183
00:11:23,283 --> 00:11:25,819
Let's just get the rules
straight here.

184
00:11:25,853 --> 00:11:29,422
There will be absolutely no partying
in this hall between the hours...

185
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:33,260
Of 5:00 and 6:00 in the morning without
my expressed written permission.

186
00:11:33,293 --> 00:11:35,395
Okay, cool.
Carry on.

187
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:43,270
I'm a carnivore
and i smell freshman meat, uh!

188
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,278
Pappy.

189
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,884
undiscovered country.

190
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:59,753
Moving in for the close-Up.

191
00:11:59,787 --> 00:12:01,889
Show me love!

192
00:12:01,922 --> 00:12:03,924
And... cut.

193
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:06,659
You have got charisma!

194
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:11,865
What is that?
It's a special quality of leadership...

195
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:16,403
That captures the popular imagination
and inspires allegiance and devotion.

196
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:19,406
I mean the thing
in your hand.

197
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,409
It's a tool.
It's for your trunk.

198
00:12:24,344 --> 00:12:27,314
Oh. Thanks.

199
00:12:27,347 --> 00:12:30,283
My name is crawl and
i'm the r.A. And you're, uh...

200
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:32,820

Don't tell me. Sally?

201
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:36,656
Jessie? Raphael?

202
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:42,062
Rebecca. Oh, bec-Ca.

203
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,998
- So where ya from?
- Uh, south dakota.

204
00:12:45,032 --> 00:12:48,969
Fresh off the farm.
Oh, my god, i can't believe it.

205
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:52,439
Right across the hallway.
Hallelujah.

206
00:12:52,472 --> 00:12:54,975
So you're inbred.
Excuse me?

207
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:58,745
You know, where your mom's your
dad and your dad's your brother.

208
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:01,081
No, i am not inbred.

209
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:06,954
Hmm. Prime usda choice
teriya-Ki.

210
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:08,956
I have to go
to orientation.

211
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,959
Well, if you need anything,
i'll be...

212
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:15,863
Ooh, hey, charisma.

213
00:13:15,896 --> 00:13:20,700
It's a special quality of leadership
that captures popular imagination...

214
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,937
And inspires
allegiance.

215
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,976
Damn it, tracy.

216
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,811
I said i'd be right there.
Travis?

217
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:34,447

220
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:44,457

221
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:47,995

223
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,000

224
00:13:53,033 --> 00:13:55,735

"let the grunions live" march,

228
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:09,716
We're announcing the formation of the
"save the veal" committee.

229
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:13,420
Now you gotta make mommy and daddy proud,

230
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:16,990
Hmm. Blondie,

You miss your mom, dad,

274
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:06,093
Basically everything you can
think of back at home, right?

275
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:11,164
How do you know that?

276
00:17:11,198 --> 00:17:14,867

Grew the do,

284
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,196
This is college, man.

285
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:47,200
I mean, look at it. This is supposed
to be the best years of our lives.

286
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:51,070
- How many years have you been here?

287
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:53,940
But, hey, it's cool. I've

291
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:07,320
But, i just...
I don't fit in here.

292
00:18:07,354 --> 00:18:12,292
How do you know? You're not even here now.
You're still back there.

293
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,262
Why'd you come here
in the first place, bec?

294
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:19,799
To try something new, right?
Yeah.

295
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:24,804
Well, how can you try anything new
if you haven't even left campus yet?

296
00:18:24,837 --> 00:18:26,806
Busted.

297
00:18:26,839 --> 00:18:28,975
I know. You're right.

298
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:32,279
You gotta mingle with
the people. Come on, bec.

299
00:18:32,312 --> 00:18:35,315
What have you got to lose?

300
00:18:35,348 --> 00:18:39,085

00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,269
Come on.
Now i know this place.

306
00:18:56,303 --> 00:18:58,305
First things first.
Wardrobe.

307
00:18:58,338 --> 00:19:02,742
Now you've got
your weasel wear.

308
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,114
Crawl,

309
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:31,771
I beat you!

310
00:19:38,878 --> 00:19:41,180

Kravitz.

311
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:43,850
What's up?
Come on.

312
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:47,186
Come on, bud-Dy.

313
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,991
Ow!
Oh!

314
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,394
Does it hurt?
It's better...

315
00:19:54,427 --> 00:19:58,064
Than a kick in the face
with a golf shoe.

316
00:19:58,097 --> 00:20:00,400
So, crawl,
what do you think?

317
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,902
It's permanent.

318
00:20:02,935 --> 00:20:06,273
Crawl, i'm mingling.
It's up to you.

319
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,408
ow-Ow. Hey.
Okay.

320
00:20:08,441 --> 00:20:12,279
So what i want
is something feminine.

321
00:20:12,312 --> 00:20:14,847
He's standing
right next to me.

322
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:17,384
You see that, huh?
You see what happens? The ink soaks...

323
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:21,954
In the system and the guy's freaked out.
Look at him! What are you, you freak?

324
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:24,891
That's a good point.
So?

325
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:28,928
You pick it,
i stick it.

326
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:33,866
* in a perfect world

327
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:37,804
* it would never end like this ** hey,
that is enough.

328
00:20:37,837 --> 00:20:40,139
Oh, i'm sorry.
God!

329
00:20:40,172 --> 00:20:43,410
You didn't like it?

330
00:20:43,443 --> 00:20:46,946
So what about yours?
What's your family like?

331
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,149
Sadie's a pit boss in vegas.
She's on her fourth marriage.

332
00:20:50,182 --> 00:20:52,285
Fourth? My god.
To frank.

333
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:55,288
Frank sells
plastic catheters, bedpans,

334
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:57,290
Stuff to hospitals.

335
00:20:57,324 --> 00:20:59,959
You'll probably see some of his work
wash up here onshore from time to time.

336
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,995
Really, you will.

337
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:05,898
Wow!
She is fantastic!

338
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:08,968
Let me see her. Hey, hey, hey.
Oh, oh! Touch me!

339
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,338
Touch me.
Hey, over here!

340
00:21:11,371 --> 00:21:14,341
Somethin' just came up!
She's a hottie.

341
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:17,344
That's the kind of girl i'm gonna marry,
rebecca. I promise.

342
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,145
Oh, you could do much better than that?
Better than that?

343
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:22,248
Well, i never seen
no one better than her.

344
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,317
Oh, my god.
No one likes me like her ever.

345
00:21:24,351 --> 00:21:27,987
Look at that guy.
What happened to him?

346
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,090
Steroids.
His cones are bigger than mine.

347
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,193
Becca...
travis.

348
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:37,296
What? I'm just looking.

349
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:39,966
hollywood's got her set up
for the body slam and oh!

350
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:43,703
That's gotta hurt, boys. Lightning comes
back with a shoulder hook for the escape.

351
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:45,972
Whoo!
Get her for big daddy now.

352
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:47,974
Come on, for big daddy,
big daddy.

353
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,279
Yeah!

354

Those are my kind of girls!
Let's just go. Let's just...

355
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:59,352
Fake cones, lee press-Ons, hair extensions.
That's the girl i'm gonna marry.

356
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,721
let's hear some noise
for hollywood and lightning,

357
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:04,391
With hollywood taking that one
in three falls, gentlemen.

358
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:08,395
Three falls. Hollywood and lightning.
Here. Resident advisor.

359
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,731
all right, sports fans,
are you ready to rumble?

360
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,900
We've got a challenge match
this evening.

361
00:22:13,933 --> 00:22:18,471
And in the far corner, the resident advisor!
Crawl.

362
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:22,409
Let's hear it for crawl!

364
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,981
And his worthy opponent,
the queen of the ring,

365
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:34,086
A ton of fun,
the brawlin' bunny, thumper!

366
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,155
Aha! Yeah!

367
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,726
I hope the resident advisor
hasn't been ditching p.E. Aah!

368
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:43,730
Thumper's got him up in a full helicopter.
He's twirlin', he's twirlin'!

369
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:47,033
Oh! And down he goes
with a body slam, boys!

370
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:49,268
Oh, geez!

00:23:05,251 --> 00:23:08,054
Whoo! Thumper!

Our ton of fun,

00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:19,398
The reigning champion, thumper!
You...

488
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:53,860
You have no clue on how huge you

489
00:29:53,893 --> 00:29:57,296
We love
your wine coolers.

Fine. I'll sleep in the barn.
Stop whining.

493
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:10,476

Hey, warners?
Look, i'm sorry i snapped back there.

502
00:30:34,366 --> 00:30:36,869
I just never been
in a place so pure.

503
00:30:36,903 --> 00:30:40,006
So if i'm being an inconvenience,

Not at all.
Please just make yourself at home. Really?

505
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,677
Um-Hmm.
Where's the kitchen?

506
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:48,881
It's right back there.
I'm gonna go munching on some grindage...

507
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:51,017

Ha! Ooh-Ooh!

509
00:30:56,355 --> 00:30:59,025
Look at this place.

510
00:30:59,058 --> 00:31:01,493
spectacular quarters, me matey.

511
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:05,331
Did you design it yourself?
Look what i got for you, buddy.

512
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,766
A sandwich too.

513
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,436
That's okay.
I'll pass. You sure?

514
00:31:10,469 --> 00:31:14,173
Yeah. I'll put it over there just
in case you get hungry later.

515
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:17,376
Since we're
gonna be roommates.

516
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:20,046
the 2-Cjx! Look at this.
hello, zack.

517
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:23,449
Don't touch that.
I just wanted to take a peep.

518
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,718
Maybe now's a good time to talk
about the rules in my room.

519
00:31:26,752 --> 00:31:29,121
Rules?
Yeah.

520
00:31:29,155 --> 00:31:32,391
Rule number one:
don't touch anything.

521
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,861
And what's rule number two?
There's only one rule.

522
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:40,432
Don't touch...
Anything!

523
00:31:40,466 --> 00:31:42,801
Got it.

524
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:44,937
I'm takin' this back.

525
00:31:46,438 --> 00:31:49,075
You ever meet the tooth fairy?
No.

526
00:31:49,108 --> 00:31:50,977
Never?
No.

527
00:31:55,181 --> 00:31:58,917
I wouldn't fall asleep if i were you.
Mom!

528
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:01,120
I'm just kidding!
Mom!

529
00:32:01,153 --> 00:32:03,655
Relax, bro.
Come on.

530
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:07,459
I'm becca's friend, dude.
Puffy cheeks, chill.

531
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:10,129
There, girl.

532
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:15,134

533
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18,971

534
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:23,942
- I mean, who is he?
- Oh, travis, i'm sorry. He's my neighbor.

535
00:32:23,976 --> 00:32:28,747
He-He was alone for thanksgiving.
He's just a friend.

536
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,849
Oh.

537
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:38,124
Oh, i'm so glad
you're finally here.

538
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:41,127
You know what?
I gotta get back in.

539
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:45,097
Oh, no, wait.
Uh, before you go, um, uh... What?

540
00:32:45,131 --> 00:32:47,133
What?

541
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:50,269
Well, i-I've been thinkin'
a lot about us lately, you know?

542
00:32:50,302 --> 00:32:53,972
I mean, you've been gone for
three months and i realized...

543
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,275
How much i love you.
Travis.

544
00:32:56,308 --> 00:33:00,046
And i guess what
i'm tryin' to say is...

545
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:04,283
Rebecca, will you...
Oh, god.

546
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:06,985
Wh-What is it?
I'm feeling just a little, um...

547
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:09,988
I'm just a little dizzy, that's all.
Are you okay?

548
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:12,858
Yeah, yeah. You know, i think with
the plane and all the excitement,

549
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,161
I'm just a little worn out.
Well, that's okay. That's okay.

550
00:33:15,194 --> 00:33:18,164
It's no problem.
We got all week, right?

551
00:33:18,197 --> 00:33:21,133
Right. Why don't
you take a nap?

552
00:33:21,167 --> 00:33:24,803
Okay. And i'll see ya tonight
at the country club, right?

553
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,906
Right, right. Okay.
Okay.

554
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:31,243
Oh!

555
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:34,146
Oh, rebecca,
don't worry about your hair.

556
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:37,183
It'll grow back.

557
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:41,153
error. Error. Error.
- Damn it.

558
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:44,823
Error. Error.
Can i show you a shortcut?

559
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,825
You show me a shortcut?
Yeah,

560
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:48,827
Me show you a shortcut.
Error. Error.

561
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:53,732
Can i... I have to touch your computer,
though. Be my guest.

562
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:59,037
Error. Error.
Error. Error.

563
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,039
Error.

564
00:34:01,073 --> 00:34:04,110
See that?

565
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:11,183
loading.
- Ta-Da!

566
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:15,687
It's gone.
How'd you do it?

567
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:19,057
Your pc got harshed, right, 'cause your
system heaps at the wrong parameter.

568
00:34:19,091 --> 00:34:22,761
So i toasted the dated directory,
tweaked the p-Ram...

569
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:24,863
And reglazed your subroutine.

570
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:29,034
- How'd someone like you get into computers?
- Grew up at caesar's palace.

571
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:33,805
Right? In vegas?
Gambling, cones, the whole package, right?

572
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:37,075
Didn't have any friends,
so i just pounded away on the old keyboard...

573
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:40,812
For a couple of years,
solo mission. I don't know.

574
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:44,049
So you're just an old hacker like
me but disguised as an idiot.

575
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:48,120
yeah, basically.
Zack, can you please leave?

576
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:50,822
- We're busy.
- Zack, please.

577
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,991
No, it's my room.

578
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,060
Our room.
Our.

579
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,062
I'll tell mom where
all your playboys are.

580
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:01,300
- So? I'll tell dad you got a tattoo.
- Go ahead. I don't care.

581
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,102
Playboys? Dude, don't hold out on me, bro.
What month?

582
00:35:04,136 --> 00:35:06,738
I'm a subscriber.

583
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:12,077
Whoa.

584
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,281
Crawl, we have to talk. Yeah,
i could see that. What's the problem, becca?

585
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:18,150
Travis is gonna ask me to marry him.
What?

586
00:35:18,184 --> 00:35:21,953
he got down on one knee.

587
00:35:21,987 --> 00:35:24,856
I thought he was what i wanted, but now
i just can't see myself settling down.

588
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,093
You know, i think i'm really too young...
hey, hey, hey, hey!

589
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,262
To be thinking about these things.
What? Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

590
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:33,031
Sit down.
Relax. What?

591
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,967
Hey, you don't have to do
anything you don't wanna do.

592
00:35:36,001 --> 00:35:38,337
Crawl, it's not
that easy.

593
00:35:41,006 --> 00:35:45,777
You know, we've been
together for a long time.

594
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,847
I just don't wanna hurt him.

595
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,816
Just remember, the longer you wait,
the more painful it's gonna be.

596
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,319
I know.

597
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:57,389
i'll tell him tonight.

598
00:35:57,423 --> 00:36:00,759
Listen, i-I gotta tell you somethin'.
What?

599
00:36:02,394 --> 00:36:05,297
My gear, man.
I'm feelin' really out of place.

600
00:36:05,331 --> 00:36:09,868
You gotta hook me up
with some rustic wear.

601
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,304
I could take your style with my
style and just interweave 'em.

602
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,940
get your hat.
Let's cruise. Come on.

603
00:36:22,348 --> 00:36:26,051

Come on, bud-Dy. You

608
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:45,070
Hey, miss pucket.
Hi, i think. Hi.

609
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:50,108
Inbreeders.

610
00:36:51,977 --> 00:36:54,280
Okay, we need the hat for the "do-Saver."
Charlene, get away from them!

611
00:36:54,313 --> 00:36:57,283
Oh, boots!
I'm mingling. Mommy!

612
00:36:57,316 --> 00:36:58,950
Okay, crawl, the dressing room's over there.
I need more stuff.

613
00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:00,286
No, you don't. No, you don't.
Okay. Right here?

614
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:04,189
Yes. Take these. Okay, okay.
Okay, okay, okay.

615
00:37:09,328 --> 00:37:12,464
Rebecca?
Hi, tracy.

616
00:37:12,498 --> 00:37:17,436
Wow! You look great.
I hardly recognized you. Thanks.

617
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,938
When did you get back?

618
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,974
Um, uh, this morning.

619
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:26,312
You're still here. I thought you
were going to new york or something.

620
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:29,381
Well, i still am.
I just need to save some money first.

621
00:37:29,415 --> 00:37:31,417
You're still working at the bar, though?
Yeah.

622
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,153
You should come by.
Yeah, definitely. I'd like that.

623
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:40,659
Introduce me.
Uh... Tracy, this is my friend crawl.

624
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:43,895
What's happenin'?
Nice to meet you. Likewise.

625
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:47,399
Have you ever done any acting?
Crawl, what are you wearing?

626
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:49,968
Chaps? Cheek chillers.
You likes?

627
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:53,038
I hates.
Okay.

628
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:57,175
- Not bad.
- What... Oh!

629
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:00,178
Crawl, that is disgusting!

630
00:38:03,148 --> 00:38:05,116
Hi, how ya doin'?

631
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,252
Hi.

632
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,355
Hi, travis.

633
00:38:11,357 --> 00:38:14,125
Thank you, dad.
Zack, help your sister.

634
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:17,963
Zack.
Now, if junior would get here...

635
00:38:17,996 --> 00:38:19,398
where'd... Why'd
ya go so fast?

636
00:38:27,205 --> 00:38:30,141
Hello.
My name is crawl.

637
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:32,711
Hello. Real people!

638
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:35,213
Down-Home-Cookin'
people.

639
00:38:35,246 --> 00:38:37,983
Hey, cool goatee,
buddy.

640
00:38:38,016 --> 00:38:40,218
What's up, pal? Whoa!

641
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,989
Look at him.

642
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:47,058
Aha!
Listen, you guys, i was feelin'...

643
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:51,162
Really, like, out of place,
but, hey, check it.

644
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:53,965
- Now i fit in.
- It's great.

645
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,334
Hmph!

646
00:38:56,368 --> 00:38:59,405
It's okay.
so, uh...

647
00:38:59,438 --> 00:39:01,306
- Cramp...
- Crawl.

648
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,310
Oh, right, um... what kind
of name is that anyway?

649
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:09,915
Nickname. They gave it to me my freshman year
'cause that's how i always got home.

650
00:39:15,421 --> 00:39:18,189
- En garde!
- Zack, grow up.

651
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:21,092
I can't wait
'til i grow up.

652
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:23,429
- Then i can get a tattoo just like you.
- Tattoo?

653
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:25,697
tattoo?

654
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:33,439
As you all know, rebecca warner and i have
been courting for almost five years now.

655
00:39:33,472 --> 00:39:36,708
- Oh, shit!
- He's doing it right now?

656
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:40,045
And since i think
of you all as family,

657
00:39:40,078 --> 00:39:41,112
I thought it was important that we include
you on this very special occasion.

658
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:43,181
- Crawl.
- What am i supposed...

659
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:47,753
- Honey.
- Rebecca, will you marry me?

660
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:55,293
- Do something. Do something!
- Ow!

661
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:59,465
Ow, ow, ow! Wait. I just
wanted to say something.

662
00:39:59,498 --> 00:40:03,435
Huh! I just wanted to say,
um, that travis is too late.

663
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:06,404
Whoa, this is getting good.

664
00:40:06,438 --> 00:40:10,776
Yeah, um, 'cause a couple weeks ago at
school, i already asked bec to marry me.

665
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:13,211
oh, no.

666
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:16,982
And she said yes.

667
00:40:17,015 --> 00:40:20,151
- Oh, my god.
- Here. I almost forgot, sweetie.

668
00:40:20,185 --> 00:40:25,123
Here's your little ringie.
Look it, she's nervous.

669
00:40:27,993 --> 00:40:31,963
Oh, hey, dude, don't worry.
She never cheated on you. Travis?

670
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:35,433
Travis!
Mom, dad.

671
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:39,437
Maybe now is a good time to start thinkin'
about a bachelor party.

672
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:41,973
Be back in a sec.

673
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:45,744
Travis! Travis!

674
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,481
Will you just stop?
I'm sorry.

675
00:40:49,515 --> 00:40:52,350
Just a friend.
I'm sorry.

676
00:40:52,383 --> 00:40:54,786
Alone
at thanksgiving.

677
00:40:56,387 --> 00:41:00,692
Why didn't you just tell me the truth?
Because there wasn't time.

678
00:41:00,726 --> 00:41:03,695
Your timing was perfect tonight, rebecca.
bec, are you okay?

679
00:41:03,729 --> 00:41:06,197
Yes, we're fine.
No, we are not fine!

680
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:10,035
Listen, i understand if you're pissed.
If you wanna talk about it, it's...

681
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,370
Ow! Ohh!

682
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,439
Oh!

683
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:17,676
why did you do that?

684
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,755
Get up!

685
00:41:32,357 --> 00:41:34,726
my god, i can't believe
you just did that, crawl.

686
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,163
What was i supposed to do, huh?
You stomped on my foot.

687
00:41:38,196 --> 00:41:40,498
I stood up. I said the first thing that
came to me. This is a total disaster.

688
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:42,868
You know we've destroyed travis, right?
Forget travis!

689
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:46,772
Look! Look at my nose.
Crawl, this is serious.

690
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:51,209
What do you think their
kids are gonna look like?

691
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:54,813
Zack! Zack!
I was just asking.

692
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:57,248
So what do you wanna do?
Do you wanna tell him the truth?

693
00:41:57,282 --> 00:41:59,751
No, no, n-No, w-We can't.
It'll just make it worse.

694
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:03,254
We just have to ride this out until
the end of the week, that's it.

695
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:08,226
Hmm. So you wanna stay engaged?
Please.

696
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:11,329
Okay. Can i get some tongue?
Oh, you...

697
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:13,865
Ah!
Oh, i'm sorry.

698
00:42:13,899 --> 00:42:16,334
I'm sorry.
Are you okay? Sorry.

699
00:42:25,243 --> 00:42:28,246
We just can't let this happen.
What can we do?

700
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,082
Well, uh,
we can ground her.

701
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:34,753
- What?
- Well, we're still her parents. Can't we do that?

702
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,455
She's rebelling, walter.
If we forbid it,

703
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,891
She'll run off with him
and we'll never see her again.

704
00:42:39,925 --> 00:42:43,461
Let's just calm down and
deal with this like adults.

705
00:42:43,494 --> 00:42:46,464
Right, right.

706
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:49,267
You distract him. I'm gonna hit
him over the head with a shovel.

707
00:42:50,468 --> 00:42:54,873
Theo. Hey, i guess
it's miller time, huh?

708
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:57,709
Dude, you should
be drinkin' lite.

709
00:42:57,743 --> 00:43:00,912
look, you little
son of a bitch,

710
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,749
I can smell your shitty
stink a mile away,

711
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05,651
So just stay clear
of me, all right?

712
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,287
So basically we're not
gonna be hanging out?

713
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,257
Okay, i'm sorry.

714
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:17,763
Hey, can i whittle wood with you?
No.

715
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:20,265
Okay.

716
00:43:24,836 --> 00:43:28,173
Honey, would you please tell
me what's going on? What?

717
00:43:28,206 --> 00:43:32,410
You bring home this boy you say you're marrying.
You don't tell us anything. Are you pregnant?

718
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:36,147
No! Well, tell me please then.
I really want to understand.

719
00:43:36,181 --> 00:43:39,150
It's not what you think.
Great! What is it then?

720
00:43:39,184 --> 00:43:41,753
Look, it's not that big a deal.
Not that big a deal?

721
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:43,689
Getting married's
not that big a deal?

722
00:43:43,722 --> 00:43:46,257
Honey, getting married
is a very big deal.

723
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,961
We sent you away to college so you
could have choices for your future,

724
00:43:49,995 --> 00:43:52,964
Not to go and marry the first
thing that comes along. Thing?

725
00:43:52,998 --> 00:43:56,702
Well, yes.
He's... weird.

726
00:43:56,735 --> 00:43:59,805
You are so out of it, connie.
I am not...

727
00:43:59,838 --> 00:44:01,840
What is this "connie" business?
I'm your mother! And i'm an adult!

728
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:04,843
Oh, well, uh, uh...

729
00:44:04,876 --> 00:44:07,979
oh, perfect timing. Listen.

730
00:44:08,013 --> 00:44:12,818
- I got some amazing thoughts about this bachelor party.
- Never mind about that.

731
00:44:12,851 --> 00:44:15,286
I need to know
what your plans are.

732
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:18,156
Well, actually, sir, i was thinkin' about
stayin' in school for a couple more years.

733
00:44:18,189 --> 00:44:21,159
You know, goin' into
european studies, buddy.

734
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:25,163
I mean, cruisin' around europe, backpacking,
right? Munchin' that ch-Ch-Ch-Cheese,

735
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:27,699
- A little vino.
- yeah, yeah, yeah.

736
00:44:27,733 --> 00:44:31,870
Now just a minute here.
How do you propose...

737
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:35,340
To support
my daughter?

738
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:39,745
Well, what do you do?

739
00:44:39,778 --> 00:44:43,882
- I run this farm.
- There. I could do that.

740
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,184
Huh?
I mean, since i'm part of this family now.

741
00:44:46,217 --> 00:44:50,255
It's tough, but i'll probably
take over when you retire.

742
00:44:50,288 --> 00:44:54,259
- You wanna be a farmer?
- I think i'm gonna be sick.

743
00:44:54,292 --> 00:44:56,427
now look here, son.

744
00:44:56,461 --> 00:45:00,899
Farmin' is not like sittin'
on your butt in school.

745
00:45:00,932 --> 00:45:06,004
Farming is hard work. Yeah, i know.
I'm gonna do the nine-To-Fiver.

746
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:09,374
- Nine-To-Fiver.
- Uh-Huh. Huh!

747
00:45:09,407 --> 00:45:13,779
Nine to five.
You hear that, theo?

748
00:45:13,812 --> 00:45:17,883
I think we got ourselves a farmer.
You think you could show him...

749
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:22,020
The ropes a little bit tomorrow?
Oh, yeah.

750
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:25,290
it would be my pleasure.
- Now remember,

751
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:28,927
- We get started first thing in the morning.
- Cock-A-Doodle-Doo!

752
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:53,251
Rise and shine, valentine.

753
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:00,325
Shh!
Oh, i thought you were a burglar.

754
00:46:00,358 --> 00:46:04,062
You have got
to stop doin' that.

755
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:07,999
You gotta admit, man, it's kinda wild that
i'm weizin' on the farmer's daughter.

756
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:10,902
Mmm, steam.

757
00:46:10,936 --> 00:46:14,272
like a jacuzzi.
Yeah, sort of.

758
00:46:14,305 --> 00:46:17,843
- Hop in!
- Ow!

759
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:22,380
How you like that smell?

760
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:25,917
dig in.

761
00:46:25,951 --> 00:46:28,686
okay.

762
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:31,857
Put that grain into this trough.
Uh-Huh.

763
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:35,393
All the way to the end.
All the way to the end?

764
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:40,331
ain't farmin' fun?

765
00:46:40,365 --> 00:46:42,700
piggy! Piggy!
hey.

766
00:46:42,733 --> 00:46:44,702
Pour that slop right
in the trough there, son.

767
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,772
Right here? Yeah, right there.
Whoa, whoa! Wait a minute!

768
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,240
Get on the other side.
You don't wanna get trampled. Thank you.

769
00:46:49,274 --> 00:46:54,812
There you go. Don't get none of that on ya.
Get over there, hoss! Baby!

770
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:58,049
Ooh, yeah.
I'm farmin' it now, theo.

771
00:46:58,083 --> 00:47:01,119
Ooh, you just love your foody!
Yah, pig!

772
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,154
yah!

773
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,991
Aah! Nice piglet!
Piggy! Piggy!

774
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:12,730
How you like farmin',
city boy?

775
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:15,666
All right, city,
just climb up on this tractor here.

776
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:18,736
I used to have one of these when i
was a little fella. That's wonderful.

777
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:21,672
Get up there. I want you to fire it up.
You gotta pull out the silver button,

778
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,741
Push the black 'un.
The blacken?

779
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:26,011
Come on.
I ain't got all day.

780
00:47:26,044 --> 00:47:28,980
Ooh!
All right. Now,

781
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:32,884
Drop it down into first gear there,
down to your right. Yeah?

782
00:47:32,918 --> 00:47:35,887
And then bring her on back in.
Give it plenty of gas. Okay.

783
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:39,157
stop, theo! Theo, stop it!

784
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,160
Help!
I forgot to tell ya there.

785
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:44,729
That first gear can be
just a little tricky.

786
00:47:44,762 --> 00:47:48,033
Kinda saggy there, elsie.

787
00:47:48,066 --> 00:47:50,001
I know a killer doctor
in beverly hills...

788
00:47:50,035 --> 00:47:52,703
that will nip and tuck ya.

789
00:47:52,737 --> 00:47:57,342
Oh, just chill, buddy. Here we go.
A little milk-Age. Check it.

790
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:06,417
Oops, wrong button.

791
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,055
Lunch!

792
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:14,459
Old theo told me
the cow pissed on his head.

793
00:48:14,492 --> 00:48:17,963
**

794
00:48:17,996 --> 00:48:21,399
Mmm, smells
like down-Home cookin'.

795
00:48:21,432 --> 00:48:23,935
- You okay?
- Hey, hey, hey, i'm okay.

796
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,937
First day, first day.

797
00:48:25,971 --> 00:48:28,974
This barnyard stuff is not
as easy as i thought, though.

798
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:33,044
I gotta hand it to you mr. Warner.
You farm guys got it goin' on.

799
00:48:33,078 --> 00:48:36,714
Yeah, well,
i guess your farm days are about over, huh?

800
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,085
Nope. Just haven't found
my groove yet.

801
00:48:40,118 --> 00:48:43,121
Groove?
You destroyed my fence.

802
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:46,091
I lost half my chickens.
You messed up my tractor.

803
00:48:46,124 --> 00:48:49,794
Listen, i figure your "groove"
cost me about close to $1,000 this morning.

804
00:48:49,827 --> 00:48:53,231
Sir, i plan on paying
you back for the damages.

805
00:48:53,264 --> 00:48:57,768
How are you gonna do that?
You don't even have a job.

806
00:48:57,802 --> 00:49:00,405
Well, yes, i do.
I'm a farmer.

807
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,674
Don't be callin' yourself
a farmer.

808
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:07,412
And i gotta tell ya somethin' else.
I mean, i'm sorry,

809
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,815
But you, you just stink
to high heaven.

810
00:49:10,848 --> 00:49:14,152
- Walter!
- Well, i've lost my appetite.

811
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:17,122
- Will you just stop it?
- I don't believe i was talkin' to you, young lady.

812
00:49:17,155 --> 00:49:21,126
- Just leave him alone, walter.
- Don't call me... walter!

813
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:23,128
Walter.
I'm your father.

814
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:26,131
I should be treated with
a little respect around here.

815
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:29,267
Well, then how about treating me
with some respect? Out of control.

816
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,137
Well, look what you do when you make
decisions. You throw it all away.

817
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,205
- Walter, hush!
- How would you know what i did?

818
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,807
Well, that tattoo gives me
a pretty good idea.

819
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:38,809
Come on, dad,
it's just a butterfly.

820
00:49:38,843 --> 00:49:41,679
- Out of control.
- It's not like she killed anyone.

821
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:44,849
- You just stay out of this.
- Oh, i can't have an opinion?

822
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,052
The day you make a contribution around
here is the day you can have an opinion.

823
00:49:47,085 --> 00:49:49,887
- Walter!
- I contribute.

824
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:51,189
These children
are out of control.

825
00:49:51,222 --> 00:49:54,159
- These children are not out of control...
- What's the deal?

826
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,961
And they are my children,
and you just stay out of this. I'm sorry.

827
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,165
All right, let's just
all settle down.

828
00:50:00,198 --> 00:50:02,967
- I'm not gonna settle down.
- Walter, i want you to stop this right now.

829
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,971
- I should have stopped it, but i listened to you.
- I didn't have a say in this?

830
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:09,240
- We made that decision together.
- No, we don't make anything together.

831
00:50:09,274 --> 00:50:13,711
And that's my fault?

832
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:18,049
Shh! Eh, eh, eh! Shh! Please!
Please! What happened to my family?

833
00:50:18,083 --> 00:50:20,151
Calm down.
You people are being so mean.

834
00:50:20,185 --> 00:50:22,753
Look at you. Listen.

835
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:26,724
Becca always told me about
what a great family she had.

836
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:31,162
And then i get here and i meet you guys
and she's right. You guys are great.

837
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:35,166
You're like the waltons.
And then i come in.

838
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,904
And i wrecked your whole harmonious vibe.
Look, it's obvious what the problem is.

839
00:50:39,937 --> 00:50:42,940
So i'm just gonna go.

840
00:51:06,831 --> 00:51:09,800
Forgot my stuff's
upstairs.

841
00:51:09,834 --> 00:51:12,303
Fine.
I'm going too, then.

842
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:17,275
Wait. Now this has gotten completely
out of hand. Come back in here. Walter.

843
00:51:17,308 --> 00:51:20,077
All right, look,
nobody's goin' anywhere.

844
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:22,913
We're all just gettin'
a little bit out of, uh,

845
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:25,783
Uh, control here.
Uh, crotch...

846
00:51:25,816 --> 00:51:27,952
crawl!
All right, all right! Crawl.

847
00:51:27,985 --> 00:51:31,122
- Crawl, we want you to stay.
- Are you sure?

848
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:33,991
Pretty sure. I mean,
i'm sure. I'm sure.

849
00:51:34,024 --> 00:51:36,794
Okay, well, if you insist.
No, no, no, i insist.

850
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,298
Well, i'd love to stay and chat,
but i've got a lot of work to do.

851
00:51:40,331 --> 00:51:42,833
I'm gonna grab a couple little
drumsticks for the road.

852
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:44,969
Sir, you're not gonna
be disappointed.

853
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:47,305
wait. I'll give
ya a hand.

854
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:50,308
really? Well, all right.
Yeah.

855
00:51:50,341 --> 00:51:54,011
Thanks.
* old macwalter had a farm

856
00:51:54,044 --> 00:51:57,081
* ee-Yi-Ee-Yi-Oh

857
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:59,984
* and on this farm he had a kid
with squishy, puffy cheeks *

858
00:52:00,017 --> 00:52:02,320
* with a fft-Fft here
and a fft-Fft there *

859
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:04,289
* there a fft, here a fft
everywhere a fft-Fft **

860
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:06,324
I'm going to my room.

861
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:20,971
Okay, now look.
Watch out for...

862
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:23,941
That button right there.
Buddy, it is dangerous.

863
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,811
Don't worry.
I've done this before.

864
00:52:26,844 --> 00:52:29,146
Come on. Try it.

865
00:52:29,180 --> 00:52:31,148
Try it.

866
00:52:31,182 --> 00:52:34,285
Look, i can't.
I'm bashful.

867
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,323
It's kind of like feelin' a cone for the
first time. It's not like a real tit.

868
00:52:38,356 --> 00:52:43,160
Huh! I've had my hands on some pretty
freaky cones back in I.A., Man.

869
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,830
Have you had your hands
on my sister's?

870
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,999
Don't talk about your sister like that, man.
Come on. Sorry.

871
00:52:49,033 --> 00:52:50,968
Geez.

872
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:54,138
Whoa!

873
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,807
Yeah!

874
00:52:56,841 --> 00:53:00,878
You're pretty good at this, zack.
Great. My life's ambition.

875
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,148
Okay, now let me try it.
Okay.

876
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:06,317
What... Is there, like, a special technique,
man? Yeah, start at the top...

877
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:10,321
Uh-Huh.
And squeeze it, and then go down all the way.

878
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:14,925
Wow, you're right.
It's not like a real tit. Yeah.

879
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:23,368
* yee-Ee

880
00:53:34,078 --> 00:53:38,283
Here it is!
These are your vittles!

881
00:53:38,316 --> 00:53:42,953
Come and get it, baby!
It's chow time!

882
00:53:42,987 --> 00:53:45,122
Soo-Ey!

00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:55,199
Oh! Hey, boys!
Come on, eat 'em up! * yee-Ee

884
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:59,937
* yee-Ee *

885
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:02,307
- Sic him, pig!
- Come on, porky!

886
00:54:08,846 --> 00:54:12,082
Back it, dude. Reverse.
Towards that way.

887
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:14,118
Come on.

888
00:54:14,151 --> 00:54:17,288
theo!

889
00:54:17,322 --> 00:54:20,325
Check on it, buddy!
Sometimes that boy just chaps my hide.

890
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,963
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

891
00:54:37,174 --> 00:54:40,311
What... is that?

892
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,857
Hmm. Mischief.

893
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:55,292
Huh! Ah, look at this thing.

894
00:54:55,326 --> 00:54:57,928
It's like a big video game.

895
00:54:57,962 --> 00:55:00,865
Stick shift.
One, two, three.

896
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:05,970
A little music.
"John denver."

897
00:55:06,003 --> 00:55:07,972
Hmm.

898
00:55:08,005 --> 00:55:10,375
Where can i stick this?

899
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:14,178
Oh, yeah, there it is. Uh-Huh.
Just slide it right there.

900
00:55:14,211 --> 00:55:17,314
Doesn't work.
Gotta turn it on.

901
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:20,284
And then up.

902
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,319
Oh, cool.

903
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:26,223
* i pull out my fiddle

1071
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,780
Step up to bat,
brother.

1072
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:19,083
Go with it, man.
Just do it.

1073
01:05:19,116 --> 01:05:21,952
Feel the breeze
and let it fly.

1074
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:24,121
Ah, yeah, 747.

1075
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,957
horace, are you okay?

1076
01:05:31,195 --> 01:05:35,732
Yeah! Oh, horse,
you're the man!

1077
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:38,468
oh, bull.

1078
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:43,974
Oh, dad, you missed
one heck of a party.

1079
01:05:44,008 --> 01:05:47,477
what was it,
a halloween party?

1080
01:05:47,511 --> 01:05:51,081
Dad. Yeah, i tell you,
i'm sure worn out.

1081
01:05:51,115 --> 01:05:54,118
Think i'm gonna go on upstairs
and get a little shut-Eye.

1082
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:56,120
you coming up?

1083
01:05:56,153 --> 01:05:59,256
Yeah.
We need to talk, junior.

1084
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:04,028
Uh, uh, dad,
give me a little rain check on that, okay?

1085
01:06:12,136 --> 01:06:14,938
Ah, what...
Oh! Whew!

1086
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:16,973
Did you see
that horacey, man?

1087
01:06:17,007 --> 01:06:19,843
You had wasco rockin'!

1088
01:06:19,876 --> 01:06:22,479
Forget about wasco.
Think about your parents right now.

1089
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:24,481
I mean, you dad's
gettin' busy.

1090
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:28,452
I know.
I have never seen them like this before.

1091
01:06:28,485 --> 01:06:32,122
Oh... thanks, crawl.

1092
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:36,860
You really saved me this week.
Becca, i'm a friend...

1093
01:06:36,893 --> 01:06:38,862
And i'm
at your service.

1094
01:06:38,895 --> 01:06:42,099
If it wasn't for you, i'd
probably be engaged right now.

1095
01:06:44,101 --> 01:06:47,737
You are engaged.

1096
01:06:47,771 --> 01:06:50,074
Oh, yeah.

1097
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:58,748
Don't mind me,
nobody else does.

1098
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:02,986
Good night, crawl.

1099
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,723
Oh. Thank you, pappy.

1100
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:11,061
- Good night, pappy.
- Good night, shortcake.

1101
01:07:17,967 --> 01:07:20,270
Oh, shit.

1102
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:34,918
Can i please
whittle wood with you?

1103
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:38,054
All right.

1104
01:07:38,088 --> 01:07:41,191
Grab a piece
of wood.

1105
01:07:41,225 --> 01:07:44,294
You know i majored in creative woods, right?
Uh-Huh.

1106
01:07:44,328 --> 01:07:47,897
Second freshman year.
Here.

1107
01:07:49,166 --> 01:07:51,835
Huh!

1108
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:12,122
Sounded like you and walter were gettin'
busy. Rebecca!

1109
01:08:12,156 --> 01:08:14,224
Mm-Hmm.

1110
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:17,161
What?

1111
01:08:17,194 --> 01:08:21,131
Oh, honey,
i don't believe you.

1112
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:26,236
Crawl!
Thanks for leaving me with a semi last night.

1113
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:29,306
It's okay, it's okay.
Zack hooked me up...

1114
01:08:29,339 --> 01:08:32,142
With last month's issue...
The poisons have left the building.

1115
01:08:32,176 --> 01:08:35,279
- Thank god.
- Good morning, everybody.

1116
01:08:35,312 --> 01:08:37,314
Morning, dad.

1117
01:08:37,347 --> 01:08:39,816
Beautiful day.
Oh!

1118
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:42,819
- Bull!
- Ooh, walter.

1119
01:08:44,020 --> 01:08:46,823
What is that one?
Fishing.

1120
01:08:46,856 --> 01:08:48,091
It's called "whopper."
walt!

1121
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:52,362
- Dig the gear. Big fishing expedition, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

1122
01:08:52,396 --> 01:08:55,131
Mmm.
Can i come?

1123
01:08:55,165 --> 01:08:57,201
Um, oh,
i don't think so.

1124
01:08:57,234 --> 01:08:59,969
Oh, come on, honey. Let him go with you.
Well, now wait a minute.

1125
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:03,373
I gave dad a rain check on a talk we
were supposed to have this morning.

1126
01:09:03,407 --> 01:09:08,178
Well, that's okay, sir, 'cause i'm just
gonna stay here and take the combine out.

1127
01:09:08,212 --> 01:09:13,283
let him go with you.
- All right, you can come.

1128
01:09:13,317 --> 01:09:18,388
Well, all right, sir. I think, i think,
i, well, i think you made a right choice.

1129
01:09:18,422 --> 01:09:20,390
Zack, i threw your gear
in the truck out there.

1130
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,892
Come on.
Let's go fishin'.

1131
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:25,395
I don't feel like it.

1132
01:09:25,429 --> 01:09:28,865
Well, suit yourself.

1133
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,167
Bring me a big one.

1134
01:09:31,201 --> 01:09:35,305
Ow! Let's go,
hotshot.

1135
01:09:35,339 --> 01:09:39,976
- Nasty!
- Girlfriend, girlfriend, aaaaaahh.

1136
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:44,180
So, walter, don't hold out on me, dude.
Did you get her?

1137
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:56,826
No, no, no, no.
No, look.

1138
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,162
It's all in the wrist.
See? You just pop it up,

1139
01:09:59,195 --> 01:10:02,065
Pop it out there,
flick it a couple of times.

1140
01:10:02,098 --> 01:10:05,001
Just drives those trout wild.
No, no, no, no.

1141
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:09,005
You got your...
You got your rod upside down.

1142
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,041
Turn it over.
Turn your rod... That's right. All right.

1143
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:14,878
Now, go ahead. Pop it out.
No, just one hand.

1144
01:10:14,911 --> 01:10:16,880
Just do it with one hand.
That's right. Go ahead.

1145
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:24,187
Ah, shit.

1146
01:10:24,220 --> 01:10:28,292
Look, i'll tell you what. Why don't you
put the fish that dad and i catch...

1147
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:30,460
Into the bucket 'til you
get the hang of it.

1148
01:10:30,494 --> 01:10:32,429
Look, i'm really sorry.
It's all right.

1149
01:10:32,462 --> 01:10:35,131
I got one!
He got one!

1150
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:37,901
See, junior?
That's how you do it.

1151
01:10:37,934 --> 01:10:43,139
Yeah, over the head.
That's the way to do it.

1152
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:47,243
I never could understand that
sidearm business of yours.

1153
01:10:47,277 --> 01:10:49,279
Yeah, well,
that's the way i like to do it.

1154
01:10:49,313 --> 01:10:54,318
Yeah, well, it don't make it right.
Yeah, well, whatever.

1155
01:10:54,351 --> 01:10:59,088
You get some kind of pleasure
out of not listenin' to me?

1156
01:10:59,122 --> 01:11:02,125
Aw, look, dad, i just don't want to
have this conversation anymore, okay?

1157
01:11:02,158 --> 01:11:05,329
I got a particular way i like
to do things and that's it.

1158
01:11:05,362 --> 01:11:08,398
Just give me a little room.
A little room, huh?

1159
01:11:08,432 --> 01:11:12,469
Room you want?
You got it! I tell you,

1160
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:15,839
It never fails...
I try to help him, every time.

1161
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:17,907
Try to teach him something, and what happens?
Every single time.

1162
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:20,344
He turns on me
like a viper in the grass.

1163
01:11:20,377 --> 01:11:26,316
He is one ungrateful son of a bitch and
i'm gonna tell it to him to his face.

1164
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:33,156
- You know, i kind of feel sorry for you, mr. Warner.
- What?

1165
01:11:33,189 --> 01:11:36,326
Well, your dad, you know. I've been
noticing the way he's always treatin' you.

1166
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,263
Oh, he's been like that as long as
i can remember the son of a bitch.

1167
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:44,300
Kind of like the way you get down on zack
for the way he does things, too, huh?

1168
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:48,304
I'm sorry.

1169
01:11:52,308 --> 01:11:55,144
You talkin' about the way he plays with
those stupid computer games all day?

1170
01:11:55,178 --> 01:11:57,146
Those aren't just games to him.

1171
01:11:57,180 --> 01:12:02,018
That's what he's into. He's not
asking you to do it, is he?

1172
01:12:02,051 --> 01:12:05,121
He just wants
some room too.

1173
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:09,292
Yeah, well, uh, uh...
who asked you?

1174
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,461
I'm sorry.

1175
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:15,131
Dad!

1176
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:18,167
Dad!

1177
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:24,073
dad, come here.
Lay down here.

1178
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:26,410
Where are your pills?

1179
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:29,679
In, in my jacket in the truck.

1180
01:12:30,514 --> 01:12:32,416
Help.

1181
01:12:32,449 --> 01:12:35,151
Assess the situation.
Gramps is dying.

1182
01:12:35,184 --> 01:12:39,489
Okay. C.P.R.
Right! Okay.

1183
01:12:39,523 --> 01:12:42,492
Tilt the head back.

1184
01:12:42,526 --> 01:12:47,030
Plug the nostrils.

1185
01:12:47,063 --> 01:12:51,234
And administer
mouth-To-Mouth.

1186
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:58,742
What happened?
What happened? Geez.

1187
01:12:58,775 --> 01:13:01,945
He tried to kiss me. Dude,
i was doin' c.P.R. I know what i'm doin'.

1188
01:13:01,978 --> 01:13:05,949
I majored in it for a half semester.
Here.

1189
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:10,186
Well, if it's
between my dyin'...

1190
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,456
Or him kissin' me,

1191
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:16,059
I'd rather die.

1192
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:24,734
Hey, guys.

1193
01:13:24,768 --> 01:13:27,136
Catch anything?

1194
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:31,207
Come on. Here, let me help you.
Is he okay?

1195
01:13:31,240 --> 01:13:33,142
Come on, dad.
You're gonna be okay, all right?

1196
01:13:33,176 --> 01:13:35,445
Just shake it out.
You're not dizzy or anything, are you?

1197
01:13:35,479 --> 01:13:39,082
Dad, are you okay? Something happen?
Nothing to be alarmed about.

1198
01:13:39,115 --> 01:13:40,984
Are you sure?
He just had a spell.

1199
01:13:41,017 --> 01:13:43,319
I'm okay. I'm all right.
Let's go inside.

1200
01:13:43,352 --> 01:13:45,321
Crazy kid nearly kissed me.
Listen, um, um, crawl, i just...

1201
01:13:45,354 --> 01:13:48,124
Want you to know how much i appreciate
what you did for my dad back there.

1202
01:13:48,157 --> 01:13:50,994
Look, it's no problem.

1203
01:13:55,799 --> 01:13:58,134
What did you do
out there?

1204
01:13:58,167 --> 01:14:01,004
We need to talk.

1205
01:14:03,773 --> 01:14:07,243
So what happened
out there today?

1206
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,445
Crawl?

1207
01:14:10,480 --> 01:14:13,116
Crawl?

1208
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:16,085
Would you
just talk to me?

1209
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:24,794
What?
Rebecca, i don't want to lie to 'em anymore.

1210
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:27,697
Oh, crawl, you're not
doing this to me now.

1211
01:14:27,731 --> 01:14:29,666
I told you, we're gonna get
back to school and i'll call...

1212
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:32,802
And i'll tell 'em we broke up.
Yeah, but your dad took me fishing.

1213
01:14:32,836 --> 01:14:35,271
All right?
We bonded. Finally.

1214
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:37,473
I like your family, rebecca.
I like 'em a whole bunch.

1215
01:14:37,507 --> 01:14:39,776
And that's why
i don't want to ruin it.

1216
01:14:39,809 --> 01:14:42,311
We just have
two more days.

1217
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:44,280
Look, i don't care, rebecca.
Oh, god.

1218
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:48,384
Either you tell 'em
or i'm gonna tell 'em.

1219
01:14:48,417 --> 01:14:51,154
Okay.

1220
01:14:51,187 --> 01:14:55,692
Okay, i'll tell 'em. Yes!
Are you gonna tell 'em?

1221
01:15:22,185 --> 01:15:24,821
Hey, city.
Hey, theo.

1222
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:27,824
Ever pick out your own
turkey for thanksgiving?

1223
01:15:27,857 --> 01:15:32,061
Yeah, stouffers,
swansons and butterballs.

1224
01:15:32,095 --> 01:15:35,164
This ain't no
supermarket, boy.

1225
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:39,335
Uh, hey. How ya doin', man?
Gobble, gobble, man.

1226
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:41,337
All right, partner.

1227
01:15:41,370 --> 01:15:43,406
You should do some aerobics
and bail the belly, man.

1228
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:46,342
Yeah, okay, cool. Listen, take this.
Sometimes these things can be vicious.

1229
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:48,177
Are you gonna cruise in with me?
Oh, i don't think so.

1230
01:15:48,211 --> 01:15:50,079
Ow.

1231
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:55,084
Get on over there and get dinner, boy.
Chop its head off?

1232
01:15:55,118 --> 01:15:59,455
Yeah, if you can
catch him.

1233
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:02,125
No, no, no, no!

1234
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:10,233
I'm innocent!
Theo told me to do it!

1235
01:16:10,266 --> 01:16:12,201
Stay back!
I was just kidding!

1236
01:16:12,235 --> 01:16:14,771
Help! Stop!

1237
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:26,816
The turkey had a heart attack?

1238
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:29,719
I don't know. I never
killed anything before.

1239
01:16:29,753 --> 01:16:33,389
Maybe he should give the turkey
a little kiss.

1240
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:36,660
that's real funny, guys.

1241
01:16:36,693 --> 01:16:38,662
well, you know
what they say, crawl.

1242
01:16:38,695 --> 01:16:40,764
If you kill 'em,
you gotta clean 'em.

1243
01:16:40,797 --> 01:16:42,331
Why are you
making me do this?

1244
01:16:42,365 --> 01:16:45,234
It's all part
of being a farmer.

1245
01:16:45,268 --> 01:16:48,237
Now, reach down there and grab them tail
feathers, start jerking them out...

1246
01:16:48,271 --> 01:16:50,807
And work yourself forward.
Jerk 'em on out of there.

1247
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:56,245
It's a miracle!

1248
01:17:04,387 --> 01:17:07,924
Oh, there's my ride.
Like to hang, gotta go. Bye.

1249
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,760
whoa!
Junior!

1250
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:17,300
drink that beer, boy!

1251
01:17:17,333 --> 01:17:19,803
That's it!
Bottoms up!

1252
01:17:19,836 --> 01:17:22,338
Okay, crawl, drink it down!
Yeah!

1253
01:17:22,371 --> 01:17:27,310
dude, you should invest
in a beer bong, bro.

1254
01:17:27,343 --> 01:17:30,179
The thing with
the funnel, the hoo.

1255
01:17:30,213 --> 01:17:32,348
You throw the whole case in there,
man.

1256
01:17:32,381 --> 01:17:35,785
Hey, dude, you shoot the whole thing out.
Toast, buddy!

1257
01:17:35,819 --> 01:17:38,287
you know, i didn't
like you much at first,

1258
01:17:38,321 --> 01:17:40,724
But now that i got to know ya,
you're okay.

1259
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:45,328
I still think you suck,
but you're a hell of a drinker, pard.

1260
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:48,497
This is it!
A toast!

1261
01:17:48,531 --> 01:17:49,999
To crawl!
to crawl!

1262
01:17:50,033 --> 01:17:53,870
And rebecca, your ex-Chick,
my new fiancee.

1263
01:17:56,706 --> 01:18:00,877
Hey, city.
Yeah! Get down!

1264
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,979
All right, man, this is it.
Go, go, go!

1265
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:08,017
Go! Go on! Go! Go on!
Suck it up, buddy!

1266
01:18:08,051 --> 01:18:11,320
I'm gonna go sing.

1267
01:18:11,354 --> 01:18:14,023
great. All right.

1268
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:20,329
hello. Hi, how ya doin'?

1269
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:24,834
Cool. Okay, this is a song
that really means a lot to me.

1270
01:18:24,868 --> 01:18:29,739
** * well,

1293
01:19:55,458 --> 01:19:58,094
Uh! I was just
getting started.

1294
01:19:58,127 --> 01:20:02,431
No, baby, baby, baby!
Y'all can take me on!

1295
01:20:02,465 --> 01:20:06,669
That was great, tracy.
That was great. That was great.

1296
01:20:06,702 --> 01:20:09,973
No, no, no! Come on, it's a party!
Let's go. Drink up.

1297
01:20:16,712 --> 01:20:19,315
Ah, morning. Happy turkey day.
Is the coffee ready?

1298
01:20:19,348 --> 01:20:21,350
Help yourself, theo.

1299
01:20:21,384 --> 01:20:24,687
Zack, can you bring those spices
over here please, sir?

1300
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,990
So, uh,
where's mr. Farmer this morning?

1301
01:20:27,023 --> 01:20:29,993
Oh, i imagine he's up there in his
room sleeping it off, huh, zack?

1302
01:20:30,026 --> 01:20:32,996
Not in my room.
He never came home last night.

1303
01:20:33,029 --> 01:20:34,697
Really?
might check out in the barn.

1304
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:37,901
Heard a lot of huffin' and
puffin' out there last night.

1305
01:20:37,934 --> 01:20:41,770
Oh, crawl, poor guy.
That's how he got his nickname.

1306
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:50,813
Crawl?

1307
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,102
Oops.

1308
01:21:13,136 --> 01:21:15,838
What?

1309
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:18,041
Sorry, you guys,
i didn't mean to...

1310
01:21:18,074 --> 01:21:22,378
I'm sorry.
I'm just gonna be going now.

1311
01:21:22,411 --> 01:21:25,114
Wait! Becca!
It... Ow.

1312
01:21:25,148 --> 01:21:28,051
It's not what you think!

1313
01:21:28,084 --> 01:21:30,753
I don't think.
Do you think?

1314
01:21:32,821 --> 01:21:35,959
Oh, the wedding is off!
Stop!

1315
01:21:35,992 --> 01:21:39,862
Good mornin'.
Becca, please, just wait.

1316
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:44,968
Just...
These are the days of our lives.

1317
01:21:54,110 --> 01:21:56,980
Oh, god!

1318
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:02,885
becca?

1319
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:05,654
Look, i'm sorry.

1320
01:22:05,688 --> 01:22:08,391
Oh, forget it.
It was all a big joke anyway, right? No.

1321
01:22:08,424 --> 01:22:10,960
Not for me.
I'm into you.

1322
01:22:10,994 --> 01:22:15,431
Yeah, until tracy shows up.
You into her too? Listen, last night...

1323
01:22:15,464 --> 01:22:19,102
I'm at the bachelor party, i'm doin'
karaoke and then i wake up in the barn.

1324
01:22:19,135 --> 01:22:21,104
That's all i remember
what happened, i swear.

1325
01:22:21,137 --> 01:22:25,674
Oh, crawl!
You are such a hypocrite!

1326
01:22:25,708 --> 01:22:28,144
God, you waltz in here telling
everyone to be honest with each other,

1327
01:22:28,177 --> 01:22:29,979
And the least you could do
is be honest with me.

1328
01:22:30,013 --> 01:22:32,115
I'm being honest.

1329
01:22:32,148 --> 01:22:37,786
that you blacked out
and woke up with tracy?

1330
01:22:37,820 --> 01:22:41,124
My god, you must think
i'm stupid. I am stupid.

1331
01:22:41,157 --> 01:22:45,128
I never should have brought
you here in the first place.

1332
01:22:45,161 --> 01:22:48,097
Why did you
bring me here, becca?

1333
01:22:48,131 --> 01:22:51,100
Because it was thanksgiving
and you were alone.

1334
01:22:51,134 --> 01:22:53,969
You knew travis was gonna
propose to you, huh?

1335
01:22:54,003 --> 01:22:58,674
Oh, please. I felt sorry for you.
"Please" to you.

1336
01:22:58,707 --> 01:23:02,811
Spare me. You needed someone
to shield you from travis...

1337
01:23:02,845 --> 01:23:06,149
Because you couldn't even deal with
it yourself. That is not true.

1338
01:23:06,182 --> 01:23:09,185
Have you told
anybody the truth?

1339
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,292
Talk about hypocrites.

1340
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:19,695
Hey, i don't even want
to be your friend.

1341
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:22,498
Fine.

1342
01:23:22,531 --> 01:23:25,701
Here's your ring.

1343
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:33,942
Fits better on my finger
anyways. See?

1344
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:09,212
What are you
doin' here?

1345
01:24:11,147 --> 01:24:16,051
I don't know.
What happened last night?

1346
01:24:16,085 --> 01:24:19,888
You tell me.

1347
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:25,761
Well, i woke up in the barn, but
i, i can't remember anything.

1348
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:29,098
Yeah, well, i'll tell you
what happened.

1349
01:24:29,132 --> 01:24:32,901
You and crawl were all over each other
when you left the bar last night.

1350
01:24:32,935 --> 01:24:35,104
Why don't you
take it from there.

1351
01:24:35,138 --> 01:24:37,906
I was only gonna dance for him.

1352
01:24:37,940 --> 01:24:40,075
After what
we had together?

1353
01:24:40,109 --> 01:24:42,911
Man, i thought i knew you.

1354
01:24:47,950 --> 01:24:50,986
You are so low.

1355
01:25:01,130 --> 01:25:03,132
honey, you okay?
Fine.

1356
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:05,968
Where are you going?
Out.

1357
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:10,806
Becca,
what happened?

1358
01:25:10,839 --> 01:25:12,808
everything.

1359
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,144
Wait up!
Wait!

1360
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:27,256
So i take it there's not going to
be a wedding? You got that right.

1361
01:25:27,290 --> 01:25:30,759
It's too bad.
Believe it or not,

1362
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:34,197
I was looking forward to having
you as a brother-In-Law.

1363
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:38,201
So where are
you heading?

1364
01:25:38,234 --> 01:25:40,836
Back to california...

1365
01:25:40,869 --> 01:25:42,871
Where it's normal.

1366
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:48,844
Okay. Well, if you find
a baby-Fresh nug out there,

1367
01:25:48,877 --> 01:25:50,879
Send her my way.

1368
01:25:50,913 --> 01:25:53,882
you got it.

1369
01:25:54,883 --> 01:25:56,985
Take care, all right?
Be good.

1370
01:25:57,019 --> 01:26:00,189
Okay.

1371
01:26:00,223 --> 01:26:03,125
hmm,
you made the sound well.

1372
01:26:03,158 --> 01:26:07,162
You can have my hat only
if i could squeeze your cheeks.

1373
01:26:07,196 --> 01:26:09,332
Squeeze.
Yeah.

1374
01:26:09,365 --> 01:26:13,402
take care, buddy.

1375
01:26:13,436 --> 01:26:15,904
Later.
Thanks for the cot.

1376
01:26:21,043 --> 01:26:24,313
Look, we all make mistakes.

1377
01:26:24,347 --> 01:26:27,149
I'm just so confused.
Listen, it's natural.

1378
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:29,084
You go away from home
the first time,

1379
01:26:29,117 --> 01:26:31,320
You, you try new things.

1380
01:26:31,354 --> 01:26:34,823
Yeah, i just, i mean, you know,
i thought i knew him and...

1381
01:26:34,857 --> 01:26:38,827
Look, those I.A. People are slick.
I mean, they are not like us.

1382
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:41,364
They're on a different
wavelength.

1383
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:47,336
I tried to tell ya.

1384
01:27:16,265 --> 01:27:18,233
Ah, ah, ah.

1385
01:27:20,269 --> 01:27:24,239
Get in. I think we spent enough
time together, don't you?

1386
01:27:24,273 --> 01:27:27,943
Look,
we need to talk, now.

1387
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:31,347
All right.

1388
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:39,455
Look, about last night. I think there's
something you should know about.

1389
01:27:39,488 --> 01:27:45,127
Yeah. I just wish i could
remember if i was good or not.

1390
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:48,297
Well...

1391
01:27:48,331 --> 01:27:52,100
Shit. Everybody, sit down.
Here comes our bird.

1392
01:27:52,134 --> 01:27:55,971
it's really great,
you all inviting me.

1393
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:59,141
Oh, that's a beautiful bird, mrs. Warner.
Thank you, travis.

1394
01:27:59,174 --> 01:28:01,977
You always were a great cook.
Hmm.

1395
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:04,980
Before i sit down,
i'd like to say that it's really great...

1396
01:28:05,013 --> 01:28:06,982
Having everybody together
for the holidays.

1397
01:28:07,015 --> 01:28:09,418
Matter of fact,
i'd like to make a toast. To rebecca,

1398
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:12,087
The sweetest girl
i know.

1399
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:14,357
I know we've been through
a lot the last couple of days,

1400
01:28:14,390 --> 01:28:18,861
But i still love you as much as ever,
and i think you still love me.

1401
01:28:18,894 --> 01:28:21,096
So rebecca warner,

1402
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:25,701
- Will you marry me?
- I, uh...

1403
01:28:25,734 --> 01:28:28,971
Don't even think about it, becca.
Oh, man.

1404
01:28:29,004 --> 01:28:31,139
Listen, you guys, i'm sorry
for interrupting your meal,

1405
01:28:31,173 --> 01:28:33,275
But there's something that everybody
needs to know before i go.

1406
01:28:33,308 --> 01:28:35,277
Can't you take a hint,
you idiot?

1407
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,013
Look, mr. Warner, if you don't mind,
i'd like to take this guy outta here.

1408
01:28:38,046 --> 01:28:40,215
walter, you gotta
hear this one, man.

1409
01:28:40,248 --> 01:28:42,317
Well, uh, uh, okay, crawl.
You go ahead.

1410
01:28:42,351 --> 01:28:45,153
Go ahead, tracy.
Tra...

1411
01:28:45,187 --> 01:28:48,691
Hi.
Look, rebecca,

1412
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:51,226
I woke up in the barn
with crawl this morning...

1413
01:28:51,259 --> 01:28:53,295
And i thought i did
something really stupid.

1414
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:56,999
- Mmm.
- How can you come in here and insult this family...

1415
01:28:57,032 --> 01:29:02,170
After what you did? Look, i don't remember
what i did, and i think i know why.

1416
01:29:04,206 --> 01:29:07,242
Oh. I found
these in my car.

1417
01:29:08,711 --> 01:29:11,146
Now, you said you saw me drive
off with crawl last night,

1418
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:15,150
But when i got in my car this morning,
the seat was so far back...

1419
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,152
I couldn't even
reach the pedals.

1420
01:29:17,185 --> 01:29:21,424
Somebody awfully big must have
been driving, huh, hoss?

1421
01:29:21,457 --> 01:29:26,328
Theo, you know anything
about this?

1422
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:29,331
You want to pass those
mashed potatoes there, hon?

1423
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:32,200
No, no, no, no,
now just to hell with those mashed potatoes.

1424
01:29:32,234 --> 01:29:34,703
Now, you better speak up.
Your job depends on it.

1425
01:29:37,305 --> 01:29:39,307
- Theo?
- Theo?

1426
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:45,047
Aw, hell, walter,
it was just a joke.

1427
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:49,785
- Oh...
- We took those two out there and we put 'em in the barn.

1428
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:52,020
I didn't think everybody
was gonna get so upset about it.

1429
01:29:52,054 --> 01:29:55,458
So i didn't bone her.
So he didn't bone me.

1430
01:29:55,491 --> 01:29:57,426
So you guys didn't bone.

1431
01:29:57,460 --> 01:29:59,962
Oh, now, wait a minute.
You can't really believe...

1432
01:29:59,995 --> 01:30:02,064
No, you wait a minute.

1433
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:04,700
I gotta tell you, travis,

1434
01:30:04,733 --> 01:30:09,104
It really tweaks my melon to see
a buff bro like crawl here...

1435
01:30:09,137 --> 01:30:13,809
Get weized on by a greasy
scumbag like you.

1436
01:30:13,842 --> 01:30:18,981
So you just chill.

1437
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:22,217
No, travis.
You just get out.

1438
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:25,087
Hey, you can't talk to me like that.
No, but i can.

1439
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:31,326
Majored in karate
for two semesters.

1440
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:36,799
i gotta say something here.
Theo, now,

1441
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:40,102
I appreciate your honesty,
but you're fired.

1442
01:30:40,135 --> 01:30:42,137
What?
That a boy, junior!

1443
01:30:42,170 --> 01:30:45,140
Now, just take your ass on outta
here and take him with you.

1444
01:30:45,173 --> 01:30:48,777
You take him.
I don't work here anymore.

1445
01:30:48,811 --> 01:30:51,313
He's gonna need
a lot of food stamps.

1446
01:30:51,346 --> 01:30:54,783
i'll do it.
Ah, you are so low.

1447
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,187
tracy.

1448
01:31:02,791 --> 01:31:05,260
Would you like
to join us for dinner?

1449
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:08,363
- Are, are you sure?
- Oh, definitely.

1450
01:31:08,396 --> 01:31:11,133
Great.

1451
01:31:11,166 --> 01:31:16,038
Come on, sit down here, tracy. We'd be real
proud to have you join us for thanksgiving.

1452
01:31:16,071 --> 01:31:19,708
Now, how about...

1453
01:31:19,742 --> 01:31:23,211
Having my future,
um, uh, well,

1454
01:31:23,245 --> 01:31:27,449
Son-In-Law
carve up this bird for us?

1455
01:31:27,482 --> 01:31:30,686
Oh, uh, wait.

1456
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:36,158
There's, um, there's something
that i need to tell you guys.

1457
01:31:36,191 --> 01:31:40,162
See, crawl and i
were never actually, really...

1458
01:31:40,195 --> 01:31:43,231
Sure about
the wedding date.

1459
01:31:43,265 --> 01:31:46,401
So we're gonna put things on hold for just a
little bit and we'll see how things develop.

1460
01:31:46,434 --> 01:31:48,704
Hey, i can respect that.

1461
01:31:48,737 --> 01:31:51,807
Oh, yeah, that's a hell
of an idea. Hell of an idea.

1462
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,677
No use rushing
into these things.

1463
01:31:54,710 --> 01:31:56,411
All right, all right, all right.
Enough of that. Yeah.

1464
01:31:56,444 --> 01:31:59,147
Now, let's chow down here...

1465
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:05,153
And munch on some grindage!

1466
01:32:05,187 --> 01:32:08,156
shut up!

1467
01:32:08,190 --> 01:32:10,425
We got the point!

1468
01:32:10,458 --> 01:32:13,395
Everybody say, "cheesy."
