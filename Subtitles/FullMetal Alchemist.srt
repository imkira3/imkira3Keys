00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,843
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM

2
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,198
Mom! Mom!

3
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,243
Look what I made, Mom!

4
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,704
Me, too!
But mine's cooler than Al's.

5
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,169
Edward, Alphonse, that's great!

6
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:31,049
You both manage to make
such amazing things with alchemy.

7
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,845
Do you think Dad would be proud of us?

8
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:37,514
Mm-hm.

9
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:40,934
One day, he'll come home
and tell you how proud you make him.

10
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,186
Yeah! All right!

11
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,854
Be good boys!

12
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,065
Watch out for--

13
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,240
Mother?

14
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,249
Mother!

15
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,545
I'm hungry, brother.

16
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,924
I'm cold, too.

17
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,680
I want to see Mom.

18
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:09,647
There's a passage about homunculi
in the alchemy book.

19
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,567
You mean the artificial humans?

20
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,406
I wonder if we can bring Mom back.

21
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:24,287
But creating humans
with alchemy isn't allowed.

22
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,585
Okay,
so we'll just keep it to ourselves.

23
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:42,263
<i>35 liters of water.</i>
<i>20 kilograms of carbon.</i>

24
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:47,227
<i>Four liters of ammonia.</i>
<i>1,5 kilograms of lime.</i>

32
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,725
<i>According to</i>
<i>the Law of Equivalent Exchange of alchemy,</i>

33
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,561
<i>we have everything that we need.</i>

34
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,606
<i>That's the last ingredient,</i>

35
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,817
<i>the makeup of a human soul.</i>

36
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:38,987
Hey. Is this really okay?

37
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,989
Don't say that now!

38
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,702
Yes, but the alchemy book says
it's absolutely prohibited to--

39
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,455
Don't you wanna be able to see Mom again?

40
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,040
I do…

41
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,750
Good. Then let's go!

42
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,921
Ready, Al?

43
00:05:00,091 --> 00:05:01,009
Ready.

44
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,178
Something is wrong!

45
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,328
Al!

46
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,121
Brother!

47
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,916
Al!

48
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,626
Brother!

49
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,546
Brother!

50
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,256
Al!

51
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,508
Brother!

52
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,179
Brother!

53
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,640
Al!

54
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,085
{\an8}REOLE

55
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,274
Hmm.

56
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,668
Hey, Gramps.
Why don't you just gimme that ring?

57
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,465
That's the Philosopher's Stone
all right.

58
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,105
Oh.

59
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:19,475
Give it up!

60
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,995
Whoa! Awesome!

61
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,747
That's what
the Philosopher's Stone can do.

62
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,335
It must be the real thing.

63
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,398
You can do alchemy
without a transmutation circle?

64
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,569
You saved my ass!

65
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:17,927
You're hollow inside!

66
00:11:19,303 --> 00:11:22,056
What are you? Who are… you two?

67
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:31,107
Ow.

68
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,567
Oh, no. That hurts.

69
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,362
Take this!

70
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,164
That…

71
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,459
prosthetic arm…

72
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,923
and prosthetic leg!

73
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,884
You're…

74
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,263
the FullMetal Alchemist!

75
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,645
I'm honored that you've heard of me.

76
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:19,238
Now that that's out of the way,
hand over the Stone!

77
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,189
Come on!

78
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,398
Hmm?

79
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,327
Oh!

80
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,830
-Pastor?
-Pastor?

81
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,293
Hey, hey, what…

82
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,753
Oh.

83
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,300
-Huh?
-Now you know the truth!

84
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,387
He's not a pastor
who can perform miracles.

85
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:29,683
He's just a lowlife conman
who's been deceiving you.

86
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,019
What's going on?

87
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:33,562
Oh…

88
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,484
Stay away!

89
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,819
Or she'll meet her maker!

90
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,405
Know your limit, third-grade alchemist.

91
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,575
I'll show you what separates us.

92
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,164
Oh!

93
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:05,886
-Huh?
-Huh?

94
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,846
Gotcha!

95
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,554
It's been a while, FullMetal.

96
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,472
Colonel?

97
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,182
Whoa! The Flame Alchemist.

98
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,897
-Arrest him!
-Hup!

99
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,906
Hey, what's going on? Let me go!

100
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,075
I just happened to be in town
for an inspection,

101
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:14,705
when I heard talk about
a puny alchemist who was causing havoc.

102
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:18,375
Who do you think you're calling puny? Huh!

103
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:22,671
What in the devil
have you made here?

104
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,797
Let go of me!

105
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,134
Do you know what it took for me
to find that stone?

106
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:48,155
The Philosopher's Stone is
a perfect object, and is indestructible.

107
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,949
Is that correct?

108
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,126
Looks like it's another fake, brother.

109
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,588
I'm sorry, Al.

110
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,678
Wait!

111
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,480
-Take him to Eastern Headquarters.
-Yes.

112
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,986
Ed.

113
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,093
Reole!

114
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,430
Reole!

115
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,566
Ooh!

116
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,867
Wow!

117
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:22,124
Hey, now. You must be
the famous FullMetal Alchemist!

118
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,462
Oh, wow! You became a state-certified
alchemist when you were just 12!

119
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:32,051
Oh! That armor that you wear.
That must be how you got your nickname.

120
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,096
I think you must mean my brother.

121
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:37,931
Not me.

122
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,309
Huh? You mean the short guy?

123
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,644
Yes.

124
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,480
No way!

125
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,193
But it's true!

126
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,403
My brother is so good

127
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,865
that he can perform alchemy
without drawing a transmutation circle.

128
00:17:55,824 --> 00:18:00,287
Sure, he might be short,
but he has a big heart.

129
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:04,083
Well, whoever. What I want to know is,

130
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,627
can you ask your shrimpy brother

131
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,923
to replace my food stall
with one that's made of marble?

132
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:13,967
Alchemy is not magic.

133
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,677
It's science.

134
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,846
We can't do that.

135
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,349
Don't be stingy. Come on!

136
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:23,018
Do this!

137
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,647
Alchemy follows
the Law of Equivalent Exchange.

138
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,316
You can only materialize things
of the same value.

139
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:34,238
It also follows the conservation
of mass laws, and natural providence.

140
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,366
Then there's the three major elements,
and the four protyles…

141
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,618
Aah.

142
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,370
Okay…

143
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:44,540
If I have one portion of something,

144
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,376
I can only create
the same amount of something else.

145
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,294
If I had water, I would only be able

146
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,755
to create something
that was similar in nature.

147
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,673
Huh.

148
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,716
Nothing you say makes sense.

149
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,345
But, in short,
you can't make marble out of wood.

150
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,472
I'm really sorry.

151
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,809
Al!

152
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,482
Winry!

153
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:14,528
Oooh!

154
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,531
It's been so long!

155
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,242
Huh? Where's Ed?

156
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:37,801
I'll find it no matter what!

157
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:42,514
Listen to me!
The Philosopher's Stone is just a myth.

158
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:45,475
Yeah? Well, what about the red stone?

159
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,769
That wasn't the work of standard alchemy!

160
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,815
Like I already told you,
the stone was an amplifier.

161
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,028
The military has also researched
how to amplify alchemy.

162
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:59,698
To disappointing results.
Twice, maybe three times greater.

163
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,826
How much would you need
for human transmutation?

164
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,245
A thousand times? Ten thousand?

165
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:11,126
Regardless, the state denies
the existence of the Philosopher's Stone.

166
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,921
The military would love to believe that!

167
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,923
What's that?

168
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:20,219
You're a state alchemist.
Would you defy its position?

169
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,848
Without the Philosopher's Stone…

170
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,186
Al will never be able
to get his body back.

171
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,440
I became a state alchemist
so I could access valuable information

172
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,816
about the Philosopher's Stone.

173
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,612
I'll be the military's dog
as long as I can get Al's body!

174
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,532
And find a way to recover your lost limbs.

175
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,287
Don't you get it? I don't care about that!

176
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,665
Al comes first.

177
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,628
I only want to get my brother's body back.

178
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:02,427
And you would… destroy a whole city
in the pursuit of this goal?

179
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,349
I would do anything.…

180
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,562
to get Al's body back.

181
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,534
Whatever the reason,
your duty is to follow orders.

182
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:32,207
My advice to you? Forget
about the Philosopher's Stone,

183
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,834
and explore other options.

184
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,255
Excuse me, Colonel.

185
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,965
Hey!

186
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:41,633
Captain Hughes!

187
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,012
You're looking good, Edward.

188
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,645
General Hakuro.

189
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:05,532
Aah. So you're the FullMetal Alchemist.

190
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,873
I've been looking forward to meeting you.

191
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,251
I heard you've been causing
some chaos lately.

192
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:23,383
And what about your younger brother?
In the armor.

193
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,636
Uh, well…
He's fixing up the town right now.

194
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,931
He's picking up after you!

195
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,561
I would love to meet
this armored brother of yours.

196
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,189
I'd also love
to hear about your adventures some time.

197
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:39,524
Yeah!

198
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:45,238
"Whatever the reason,
your duty is to follow orders."

199
00:22:45,739 --> 00:22:48,241
Hah! He acts so superior.

200
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,870
Every time I meet the Colonel,
he's more obnoxious.

201
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,955
We joined the military at the same time.

202
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,167
But I guess he has what it takes
to get promoted to command.

203
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,669
And are you saying
you don't, Captain?

204
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,046
Hey!

205
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:02,923
Watch it!

206
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,009
So, why are you at Eastern Headquarters?

207
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,136
I wasn't demoted,
if that's what you're thinking.

208
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,057
I'm just here for an inspection.

209
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:15,185
I just got in from Central City,
and I am beat!

210
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,439
Edward!

211
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,985
Winry…

212
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,864
Oh!

213
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,408
Oh. Oh!

214
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:36,790
What did-- Are you kidding me?

215
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:41,837
Do you know how much time I put
into this top-notch automail arm?

216
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,213
Sorry.

217
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,007
What did you do this time
to ruin it like this?

218
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:49,469
-I don't know. There was this stone dog…
-A what?

219
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,304
-"Raaarrr!"
-This is beyond repair!

220
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,557
I need to make a brand new one.

221
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,894
Your peer showed up
without notice from Central.

222
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,357
You're here for an inspection?

223
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,317
Right this minute?

224
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,694
Yes, I am.

225
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,240
Pardon me asking,
but do you have an ulterior motive?

226
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,784
Do you have reason to think I do?

227
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,244
No.

228
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,872
Hmm.

229
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,958
As you know,
the Führer works in mysterious ways.

230
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,468
I expect great things from you, young man.

231
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:35,265
But watch your back.
Elites like you are easy targets.

232
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,274
Shou Tucker. Have you ever heard of him?

233
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:50,989
Yes. Isn't he the alchemist
who specializes in transmutating chimeras?

234
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:54,868
That's Tucker, yes.
Could you introduce the brothers to him?

235
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,454
You mean Ed and Al, sir?

236
00:24:58,538 --> 00:25:01,541
I want to…
do something to help those boys.

237
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,336
Affirmative, sir.

238
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,262
Hey-- Hey! Wait a minute!

239
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:18,016
I still have those townspeople
in the palm of my hand!

240
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,946
Listen!

241
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:35,033
Everything got screwed up
because of your Philosopher's Stone!

242
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,701
Which was a fake!

243
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,703
Hmm. A fake, you say?

244
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,707
Do you think there's
a real Philosopher's Stone?

245
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:49,047
Unless there was a real one,
there couldn't be a fake one, right, Envy?

246
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,450
Look at that.

247
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,911
Now there's no real Cornello.

248
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:26,126
Well, then, I suppose
I can't be called the fake one, then.

249
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,963
Hey! Hey, Lust.

250
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:32,465
Can I eat this? Please?

251
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,217
Aaah!

252
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,511
Not this one, Gluttony.

253
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,890
If you eat this one,
he'll… upset your tummy.

254
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,871
Miss Gracia, are you sure it's okay
for us to stay the night?

255
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,373
Be my guest. The more the merrier.

256
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:07,375
We're here for a month.

257
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,918
But the house is huge for us.

258
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,590
So, the military wastes money
and resources on captains, huh?

259
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,551
Ugh!

260
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:21,598
Winry, as a mechanic, I bet you have
all kinds of trouble with this guy.

261
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,769
Ugh! Ed is the only person
who manages to break the automail I make.

262
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,687
Yeah, well, it's not like it's on purpose.

263
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,814
Doesn't matter!
Don't go breaking it again!

264
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,525
Otherwise it looks like
the work I do is cheap and shoddy.

265
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,111
You really shouldn't
put down your client, okay?

266
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,155
And you really shouldn't talk back!

267
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,573
Huh?

268
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:40,325
She's worried about you.

269
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:46,331
You can tell how much danger Ed was in
by the damage done to his automail, right?

270
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,168
No, I don't really worry about him…

271
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,134
So, you've all been friends
since you were kids?

272
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:01,763
Oh, right. We were born in Resembool
and grew up there.

273
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,517
We've known each other forever.
We're almost like siblings.

274
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,352
Hmm.

275
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,564
Uh, and now,
how did the two of you meet each other?

276
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,400
-Huh?
-Whoa! Cut to the chase?

277
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:14,693
-Get right into it!
-Yeah!

278
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,028
Okay, where do I begin?

279
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:21,866
Once he gets started, he'll go on forever.
Let me get you a little more food.

280
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,160
Ah, don't get up. I'll do it.

281
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,913
You need to take care of our little one.

282
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,790
Aah!

283
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,959
Mmm.

284
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,406
Hey, Al?

285
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,297
Edward!

286
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,426
Al!

287
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,604
Uh…

288
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,690
What was I doing?

289
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,135
<i>Hello!</i>

290
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:16,397
Who is it?

291
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,902
<i>I am who you call the world.</i>

292
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,030
<i>The universe.</i>

293
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,282
<i>God.</i>

294
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,493
<i>The truth.</i>

295
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,703
<i>The one.</i>

296
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,289
<i>And all.</i>

297
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,417
<i>And I am you.</i>

298
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:39,629
<i>I'll show you…</i>

299
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,383
<i>…that which you have always wanted…</i>

300
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,385
<i>I'll show you the truth.</i>

301
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,661
<i>My head is splitting apart!</i>

302
00:31:11,744 --> 00:31:13,162
<i>Don't break me!</i>

303
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:14,289
<i>Please don't!</i>

304
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,916
<i>Please, make it stop!</i>

305
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,136
<i>Mother.</i>

306
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,224
<i>Mother!</i>

307
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,571
<i>How'd you like it?</i>

308
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:54,787
I understand it now.

309
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:58,583
Huh.

310
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,669
I saw the truth.

311
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:07,759
My theory of human transmutation,
it wasn't wrong!

312
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:13,723
I was this close
to the truth of human transmutation.

313
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,853
I have to go back. Please show me again.

314
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,272
<i>No, you can't do that.</i>

315
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,277
<i>You've seen as much as you can</i>

316
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:28,863
<i>for the toll that you paid.</i>

317
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,573
Toll?

318
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,617
<i>Yes.</i>

319
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,705
<i>The toll.</i>

320
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:46,172
<i>You remember equivalent exchange.</i>

321
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:52,387
<i>Right? Don't you, alchemist?</i>

322
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,446
Al!

323
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:16,744
Damn it. He took it.

324
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,372
Somebody help me.

325
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,044
Please, Mom.

326
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,594
Mother?

327
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:02,040
I'm sorry!

328
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,753
This isn't what I wanted.

329
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,340
Al.

330
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,012
This is all my fault.

331
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,604
Give me….

332
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:29,108
my brother back.

333
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:35,865
I don't care what the toll is.
You can take my leg or my arm.

334
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,453
Take my heart if you want.

335
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,542
Just give him back! He's all I have!

336
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,299
<i>You're back again.</i>

337
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,676
<i>How foolish of you.</i>

338
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:11,651
Again?

339
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,904
Was it the same nightmare?

340
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,247
In the dream,
it's always the same, reliving that day.

341
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,043
Every detail.

342
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,556
The Sewing-Life Alchemist?

343
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,723
That's right.

344
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,976
His name is Shou Tucker.

345
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:48,020
A pioneer in biological alchemy.

346
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:55,153
Lately, he's been attempting to transmute
chimera with the ability to speak.

347
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,196
Chimera who can communicate?

348
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,698
That I want to see!

349
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,659
Two years ago, he transmuted a chimera.

350
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,619
It said one thing.

351
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,038
"Please kill me." And then it died.

352
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,502
Okay. But why are we meeting with him?

353
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,379
General Hakuro told us to.

354
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,466
He thinks he might have an idea
about how to get Al's body back.

355
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,641
This house is huge!

356
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:30,062
-Edward?
-Brother?

357
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,526
Dad! Look at all the visitors we have!

358
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,945
Hey, Alexander!

359
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,197
Whoa! Oh…

360
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,207
Yeah. Sorry for the mess.

361
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:54,086
It's pretty much been like this
since my wife left two years ago.

362
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,214
Thanks for seeing us. You must be busy.

363
00:36:56,297 --> 00:37:01,510
No problem! It really is a privilege
to meet the famous Fullmetal Alchemist.

364
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,012
The pleasure is all mine.

365
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:06,557
So, then. If General Hakuro
is behind your visit,

366
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:08,935
I will make you my top priority.

367
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,354
-Please.
-Thank you very much.

368
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,064
Al! This way!

369
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,860
-Al! Over here?
-Where are you?

370
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,529
-Oh!
-Here he comes!

371
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,909
Nina is… happy
to have someone to play with.

372
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,622
Sadly, I haven't had much time lately.

373
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,542
Because your state evaluation
is coming up.

374
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:39,465
Honestly, the progress reports
I submit every year to Central Command

375
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:41,884
really take a lot out of me.

376
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:44,095
Hmm.

377
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:47,098
I'm certainly not a genius like you.

378
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:54,021
It's just that my credentials
could be revoked this year.

379
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,402
I just can't let that happen.

380
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,916
You think I'm not telling you
why I'm here?

381
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,419
If I'm being perfectly honest, yes.

382
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,341
Since the Ishvalan Civil War,

383
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,969
things just haven't been the same.

384
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:28,306
The upheavals and riots
have been relentless.

385
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,475
Suspicion's rising among the citizens.

386
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,729
You think I'm suspicious too.

387
00:38:35,229 --> 00:38:36,689
I'm not suspicious of you.

388
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,358
But at Central Command,

389
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:42,653
some people are suspicious
of what Eastern Headquarters is up to.

390
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,950
So because we're friends,
they sent you here to keep an eye on me?

391
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:56,042
Roy. If you want to get to the top…

392
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,338
you'd better watch out for yourself.

393
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,507
Not everyone in the state military
will be supportive.

394
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,013
Should I watch you?

395
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,310
Yes, you should.

396
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,207
Whoa!

397
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:42,296
They call me
the pioneering creator of chimera,

398
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,841
but really, many of them are imperfect.

399
00:39:50,638 --> 00:39:54,433
But you did manage
to create a chimera that speaks.

400
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:58,062
Yes. Just once, two years ago.

401
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:02,149
You really did it. That's so impressive!

402
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:07,655
Yes, but… it only spoke three words,

403
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,407
and shortly after, died.

404
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:14,412
But those three words were enough
to earn my state alchemist credentials.

405
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:21,127
So, then, your mom's not around.

406
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,923
But it's okay. I still have
my dad and Alexander here with me.

407
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,092
Although…

408
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:33,472
lately, my dad is spending
a lot of time in his lab.

409
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,475
So it's sometimes just me.

410
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:43,858
Well, now you have us to play with.
As much as you want!

411
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,609
-You sure?
-Uh-huh!

412
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,404
Yay! It'll be fun, Alexander!

413
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,115
Come on!

414
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:01,542
In the end, I managed
to return to the Gate of Truth,

415
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,713
but all I was able to do
was get back Al's soul.

416
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,760
So you transmuted Al's soul

417
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,222
and you harnessed it
to the suit of steel armor.

418
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,020
The price that I had to pay
for returning Al's soul was my right arm.

419
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,231
But I…

420
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,153
I would have gladly given my life

421
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,781
if it meant getting back Al's body.

422
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,370
It must have crushed you.

423
00:41:41,624 --> 00:41:42,666
Mr. Tucker.

424
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,378
Is it possible for you
to get Al's body back?

425
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,424
I'm afraid…

426
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,094
it's beyond my capabilities.

427
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,225
Yeah, I… I didn't think so.

428
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:05,981
Although…

429
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,612
I'd like to do an experiment.

430
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:20,704
Hey, Edward!

431
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,750
Oh! No. No, no. Oh! Oh, oh, oh!

432
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:27,044
Ah!

433
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:30,256
-I made it!
-Sorry we had to leave so quickly.

434
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,551
Yeah, I got caught up in some paperwork
and i almost missed you.

435
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,053
For you. Gracia made it.

436
00:42:36,136 --> 00:42:39,014
Wow! Please, tell her thank you for us.

437
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,768
Oh, hey, where's Al?

438
00:42:42,851 --> 00:42:46,063
Oh, Mr. Tucker wanted Al to stay there.

439
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:49,400
He thinks he might be able
to do something for him.

440
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:53,362
That's good.
So, did you get some information from him?

441
00:42:54,947 --> 00:42:57,157
He told us about a man named Dr. Marcoh,

442
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:59,577
who's been researching
the Philosopher's Stone.

443
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,705
Right. It seems that
Dr. Marcoh disappeared a year ago,

444
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:05,666
but recently, someone said
they saw him in the Barns.

445
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:12,548
Ed, I hope that this time,
you find the Stone.

446
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,592
Mmm.

447
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,554
Hmm.

448
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:21,724
My research
wasn't very highly regarded last year.

449
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:29,356
If I don't do well this year, I'm at risk
of them revoking my state credentials.

450
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,984
You'll be okay. Cheer up, Dad.

451
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,571
Because you always study so hard.

452
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:43,412
I love you, Dad.

453
00:43:47,416 --> 00:43:48,500
You just watch.

454
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,254
I'll pull it off.

455
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:13,442
You seem worried.

456
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,196
Don't worry.

457
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,323
Al's not a child anymore.

458
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:22,117
I'm not worried about him.

459
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:26,038
It's just…
I'm not used to being without him.

460
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,375
Yeah, I know.
The two of you are always together.

461
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,546
Anyway, Mr. Tucker seems nice,
and Nina and Alexander are there.

462
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,340
That's right. So cheer up!

463
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:41,804
Oh, by the way, Nina seemed
to really take a liking to you.

464
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:43,263
Come on, Ed!

465
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,182
Mmm!

466
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:48,769
Come on, Ed! Play with me! Please!

467
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:55,442
-Yeah, little kids always seem to like me.
-Right, because you're their size.

468
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:57,152
Uh--

469
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,826
Apple pie!

470
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,620
-Are you gonna eat it already?
-It's okay?

471
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,249
Gracia baked this for us to eat it.
You know what I mean?

472
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,334
Have a piece.

473
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:22,845
Al couldn't eat… any of this,
even if he wanted to.

474
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,226
He doesn't sleep.

475
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:32,020
He doesn't feel pain or anything.

476
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:41,780
Remember, Mr. Tucker said
he'd use hypnotism on Al,

477
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,950
so he could study him
and learn everything about him.

478
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:48,495
It'll just be like he's sleeping.
Maybe Al's dreaming now.

479
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,999
Yeah, right.

480
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,878
In his dreams, he'd be eating
a huge apple pie all to himself.

481
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,089
Sure, sure! An extra-large pie
baked just for him.

482
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,508
-A tall pie's weird.
-Huh?

483
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,385
Wouldn't it be big sideways?

484
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,262
Think so?

485
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:08,849
You want another slice? Have a tiny one.

486
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:10,559
Hey!

487
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,953
I feel like… like I'm hot all over.

488
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:34,958
Maybe your soul is being
drawn back into your body.

489
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,211
Maybe. Or…

490
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,130
Or what?

491
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:42,549
It's possible that your…

492
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,638
artificially implanted memories
are just being harnessed.

493
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,266
Artificially implanted memories?

494
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,771
It's very rare for an alchemist to succeed

495
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:59,858
in harnessing a living soul
to an inanimate object.

496
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:03,695
Are you suggesting
that my memories are made up?

497
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,741
It would be a logical explanation…

498
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,080
But you might also be a rare exception.

499
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,707
I feel… dizzy.

500
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,003
Artificial memories.

501
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,562
-We're getting off!
-Uh--

502
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,189
Winry! Your bag!

503
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,653
What's going on?
We're not in the Barns yet.

504
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:45,612
The photo!

505
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,948
-What?
-Show me the photo Mr. Tucker gave you!

506
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:51,952
Here.

507
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,206
It's really him.

508
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,376
Doctor Marcoh!

509
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,544
Winry!

510
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,672
Hey, wait up, Winry.

511
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,803
Oh, hello. Excuse me!

512
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,558
Excuse me. Did you see this man just now?

513
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,310
No.

514
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,773
Just a minute.

515
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:25,027
-Can I see that again?
-Of course.

516
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:32,242
Ah, this is Dr. Mauro.
Uh, he works in that hospital.

517
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,537
I didn't recognize him,
because he looks younger in the photo.

518
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,440
Excuse me?

519
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,657
Dr. Marcoh? Are you here?

520
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,043
Why are you here?

521
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,089
How do you know my real name?

522
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,093
Please calm down, Dr. Marcoh.

523
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,012
I won't ever go back there.

524
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,769
Uh…

525
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,521
Hmm.

526
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,657
I'm sorry about that.

527
00:49:56,868 --> 00:50:00,330
I thought, when I saw you,
that they had come to take me back.

528
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:02,249
Who are they?

529
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,717
I heard you did research on
the Philosopher's Stone with the military.

530
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,303
Is it something that's related to that?

531
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:23,353
We didn't come here
to investigate for the military.

532
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:26,815
Please.

533
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:30,068
You have to tell me this one thing.

534
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,032
Does the Philosopher's Stone really exist?

535
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:48,128
You should go now.

536
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,629
What?

537
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:54,676
With the shotgun. I saw you
perform alchemy without a circle.

538
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,097
You've attempted human transmutation.

539
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,185
And as a result,
you accessed the Gate of Truth.

540
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,480
That's why I'm looking
for the Philosopher's Stone.

541
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:08,815
Please believe me.

542
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,819
You should stay away from the Stone,
for your own sake.

543
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:18,325
I need to find it,
even if it costs me my life!

544
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,244
Any involvement with the Stone
is playing with the devil.

545
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:22,871
Pursuing it will land you in hell.

546
00:51:25,832 --> 00:51:27,667
I've already been to hell.

547
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,398
How dare you?

548
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:52,901
You actually killed me.

549
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:09,417
But how is-- What is she?

550
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:14,297
Nice to see you again, Marcoh.

551
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,510
So you've been hiding out here
all these years?

552
00:52:19,845 --> 00:52:20,846
Lust.

553
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:23,265
I'm not coming with you.

554
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:28,562
You won't have to,
because you're no longer needed.

555
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,028
-You witch!
-Shut up.

556
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,739
Ed!

557
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,116
Winry!

558
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,326
Winry!

559
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:46,371
Stop your squeaking…

560
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:48,999
…FullMetal boy.

561
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,211
If you can keep quiet, I'll let you live.

562
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,674
You'll make a fine sacrifice.

563
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:06,016
But you, Marcoh, are worthless.

564
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:09,769
Don't kill him!

565
00:53:39,758 --> 00:53:40,759
I'm okay.

566
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,553
Dr. Marcoh!

567
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,392
Keep this.

568
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,565
It's the circle.

569
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,739
To transmute… the Stone.

570
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:09,246
You actually transmuted
a Philosopher's Stone?

571
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:13,083
Laboratory…

572
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:18,672
Number 5.

573
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,757
Laboratory Number 5.

574
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,597
Dr. Marcoh? Dr. Marcoh?

575
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,243
<i>Go, it's fine.</i>

576
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,870
I'll take care of the mess
and catch up with you after.

577
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:51,955
But, Winry, it…

578
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:55,875
Don't worry, I've got it.
I'll ask the local authorities for help.

579
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,213
You finally got a good lead
on the Philosopher's Stone

580
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:01,381
Be safe.

581
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,637
Go make sure
everything's all right with Al.

582
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:34,039
The Philosopher's Stone.

583
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,666
It exists.

584
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,512
Mr. Tucker!

585
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:58,480
Mr. Tucker?

586
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,566
Huh?

587
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,445
Hey, Al?

588
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:09,741
Nina?

589
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,676
Oh, hi, Ed.

590
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,554
I just got back.

591
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,225
Mr. Tucker, I have something to tell you.

592
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,523
Hey, where's Al?

593
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,068
Oh… don't worry. He'll wake up soon.

594
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,446
I've finally completed it.

595
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,739
Look at it, Ed.

596
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,369
A chimera who understands human language.

597
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:00,917
Listen.

598
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,836
That person is…

599
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:05,088
Edward.

600
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:08,591
Ed…

601
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:10,093
…ward.

602
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,596
That's right. That is very good.

603
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,645
Wow! It can really speak.

604
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:22,313
Yes.

605
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,317
I managed to make it
in time for the evaluation.

606
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:36,494
Now the military will have no choice
but to recognize my true talent.

607
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,746
Edward.

608
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,332
Edward!

609
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:45,086
Ed, play with me! Please?

610
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:54,637
Mr. Tucker.

611
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,727
Yes?

612
00:58:02,562 --> 00:58:05,732
Do you really think it's possible
to get back Al's body?

613
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,360
When did you get the state credentials
for your chimera research?

614
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,280
Well, it was…

615
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:14,365
two years ago.

616
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:19,078
And when did you say your wife left you?

617
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,211
Two years ago.

618
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,673
One more question, if you don't mind.

619
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,763
Nina and Alexander…

620
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:43,520
where are they?

621
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:51,110
I hate insightful little brats like you.

622
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:52,987
Bastard!

623
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,080
Two years ago, you used your wife.

624
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:07,252
And now, you've transmuted another chimera
using your dog and your own daughter!

625
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,675
It makes sense. There's only so much
you can do with animals.

626
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,886
But experimenting on humans?

627
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,305
Why are you so upset?

628
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:23,476
Without human experimentation,
mankind would have never progressed.

629
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:26,145
Have you completely lost your mind?

630
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:31,234
Do you think you'll be forgiven
for toying with human lives?

631
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,237
I toyed?

632
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:41,369
That's right. And what about the things
that you did to you and your brother?

633
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:43,496
You also toyed with human life!

634
00:59:44,497 --> 00:59:47,792
You and I, we're exactly the same.

635
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:49,877
Shut up!

636
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,011
FullMetal Alchemist!

637
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,221
There's nothing that separates us.

638
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:01,389
Shut up!

639
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,349
Shut up!

640
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,560
Shut up! Shut up!

641
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:11,441
-Shut up!
-Brother.

642
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,156
If you keep that up, you'll kill him.

643
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,542
Sometimes, you've gotta
get your hands dirty.

644
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,793
Mr. Tucker.

645
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:36,758
If you say another word,
I'll be the one to lose control.

646
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,552
Dad…

647
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,180
What's wrong

648
01:00:42,847 --> 01:00:43,723
Dad?

649
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:59,072
Nina. I'm sorry.

650
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,408
There's no way to turn you back.

651
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,495
We're not capable of helping you.

652
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,332
We…

653
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,627
can't trust anyone anymore.

654
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:17,757
I'm sorry.

655
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:22,011
Play with… me?

656
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,181
Play with me?

657
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:54,419
We're revoking
your state alchemist credentials.

658
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,088
Once at Central,
you'll be court-martialed.

659
01:01:58,172 --> 01:01:59,090
Take him away.

660
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,226
Do you think the two of them will be okay?

661
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,696
Alphonse! You and I got so close
to finding the truth!

662
01:02:22,488 --> 01:02:23,740
See you soon!

663
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,172
How long will you sit there
and feel bad for yourself?

664
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:43,509
Leave me alone.

665
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:49,265
You do realize
that you are a state alchemist?

666
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:51,517
You joined to use that privilege

667
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:54,353
to find a way to mend
your and your brother's bodies.

668
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:56,981
And they call us devils!

669
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,151
Don't let something like this stop you.

670
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:04,864
"Something like this…"

671
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:11,078
Yeah, you're right.

672
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:17,335
I don't care if they call me
the military's lapdog. Or a devil.

673
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,213
As long as Al and I get our bodies.

674
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,720
But the thing is…

675
01:03:31,349 --> 01:03:32,642
we're not really devils.

676
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,685
We're not gods, either.

677
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,115
We're just humans…

678
01:03:56,123 --> 01:03:58,543
We're just puny humans
who can't do anything!

679
01:04:05,132 --> 01:04:06,759
Even save a little girl.

680
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,145
Go back and rest.

681
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:20,773
Before you catch a cold.

682
01:04:48,426 --> 01:04:52,763
So, Ed's been locked up
in the library for three days now.

683
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,308
He's hardly eaten anything.

684
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:57,810
Yeah.

685
01:04:59,645 --> 01:05:01,439
He won't let me help him.

686
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,191
He says it's too dangerous.

687
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,993
What happened when you two were away?

688
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,359
What are you doing
in this dungeon all by yourself?

689
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:47,443
Captain Hughes.

690
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:51,113
Did you find what you're looking for?

691
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:56,953
Why do this alone?

692
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,038
We are friends, aren't we?

693
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:03,042
Hey, Ed! Aren't we friends?

694
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:06,754
Of course.

695
01:06:09,548 --> 01:06:11,467
And friends help each other out.

696
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:15,262
Please, come in!

697
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:20,768
Meet Lieutenant Ross and the sandwiches.

698
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,441
Eat some, or you'll collapse.

699
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,738
Thank you,
but she works for Colonel Mustang.

700
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,617
She's a highly trusted officer.
She's also a good friend.

701
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:39,578
Can't go wrong
with friends of friends, right?

702
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:45,042
-I said, can't go wrong with friends--
-Yeah, I heard you!

703
01:06:47,086 --> 01:06:48,254
Eat something.

704
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:51,549
Then we'll talk
about the transmutation circle.

705
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:53,384
-And Laboratory Number 5.
-What?

706
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:59,140
Winry! I told her not to tell anyone.

707
01:06:59,223 --> 01:07:02,560
Ah, you can't blame her.
I'm very persuasive.

708
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:03,728
Huh.

709
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:13,404
But… this all falls under
the category of classified information.

710
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,203
Dr. Marcoh was murdered.

711
01:07:22,329 --> 01:07:25,207
-Anyone involved runs that risk.
-You must not have heard.

712
01:07:29,003 --> 01:07:29,962
I'll say it again.

713
01:07:30,796 --> 01:07:32,131
We are friends.

714
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:51,108
I don't know.
We haven't found anything related

715
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:54,195
to Marcoh's transmutation circle
for the Philosopher's Stone.

716
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:58,532
It seems like they have destroyed
any of Marcoh's remaining documents.

717
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:06,040
The question is… who's behind it?
And why did they do it?

718
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,544
It's looking to me like an inside job.

719
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,715
I think you're probably right.

720
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:19,178
The military, the stone.

721
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,598
And the mysterious woman with the tattoo.

722
01:08:24,391 --> 01:08:25,559
She's not human.

723
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,979
I can't believe that woman is human.

724
01:08:33,609 --> 01:08:35,027
What about Laboratory Number 5?

725
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,075
Marcoh belonged to a lab,
but it was Laboratory Number 3.

726
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,620
There's a total of four
official military laboratories.

727
01:08:44,703 --> 01:08:47,873
But there's no record anywhere
of Laboratory Number 5.

728
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,960
But I'm sure I heard him say
Laboratory Number 5.

729
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,298
-Is this a special meeting?
-General Hakuro!

730
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,552
Oh! Hughes is here too.

731
01:08:59,635 --> 01:09:01,720
Uh… we were… looking…

732
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:05,850
Oh, that's right. That was what
a select group of people used to call it.

733
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:07,184
Sir?

734
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,396
I'm talking about your lab. Laboratory 5.

735
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,731
Do you know where it is?

736
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,942
It was before I was stationed here.

737
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:17,987
I think it's this one.

738
01:09:20,030 --> 01:09:21,282
It's a cannery.

739
01:09:22,783 --> 01:09:26,078
Why did they call a cannery
Laboratory Number 5?

740
01:09:26,620 --> 01:09:27,454
Hmm.

741
01:09:27,538 --> 01:09:29,081
The cannery is not operating.

742
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:30,708
It's in ruins now.

743
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,880
Thank you very much,
General Hakuro!

744
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:36,922
Hey, Ed!

745
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:39,383
General! Emergency!

746
01:09:40,467 --> 01:09:42,803
It's Reole, sir.
Full-scale riots are underway.

747
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:46,473
Reole?
Where the sham priest was operating.

748
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:49,727
Sir,
there has been a report of casualties.

749
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,811
I'll leave now.

750
01:09:51,312 --> 01:09:53,898
-Lieutenant Ross, return to your station.
-Sir.

751
01:09:54,982 --> 01:09:56,901
-You're our guest, Captain.
-Uh… but, sir…

752
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,235
I'm in command at Reole.

753
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:02,656
Mustang will need to be at Headquarters,
leaving you to stay here and help out.

754
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:10,331
There's already been so much
bloody violence in this country.

755
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,667
First in Ishval, now it's Reole.

756
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,295
This is the last one.

757
01:10:59,546 --> 01:11:01,799
There's no sign of a laboratory left.

758
01:11:11,767 --> 01:11:12,810
Oh damn!

759
01:11:26,115 --> 01:11:28,951
I know we're so close to the secret
of the Philosopher's Stone!

760
01:11:43,590 --> 01:11:47,219
Cheer up, Al.
We're really close to the secret.

761
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,472
Once we discover it,
we'll get your body back--

762
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:53,350
Tell me what happened
when you were with Dr. Marcoh.

763
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:54,977
Al.

764
01:11:56,478 --> 01:11:59,315
Is there something
that you've been keeping from me?

765
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:00,899
Uh… No.

766
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:09,116
We don't even know for sure
that my body actually exists.

767
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:13,120
How can you be so sure that we're ever
going to be able to get it back?

768
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:17,541
You say you transmuted my soul.

769
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,210
But maybe it's not really a soul.

770
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,796
Maybe it's just
some made-up memories you created.

771
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:25,841
What are you talking about?

772
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:30,763
Tucker told me that transmuting a soul
and harnessing it within an object

773
01:12:31,263 --> 01:12:34,266
would be virtually impossible,
especially for a kid.

774
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:37,144
That bastard Tucker…

775
01:12:38,270 --> 01:12:42,107
Whatever that lunatic said to you,
he wasn't telling you the truth.

776
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:47,071
You have to trust me.

777
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:49,531
I have to trust you?

778
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:54,036
Look at me. I'm hollow!
How can I trust anyone?

779
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:59,541
Maybe I never even existed.

780
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,002
Al…

781
01:13:02,086 --> 01:13:04,630
Maybe everything is just made up!

782
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,177
I know you're all deceiving me.

783
01:13:12,012 --> 01:13:13,680
Ed, you're a liar!

784
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:14,598
Ed!

785
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,353
No.

786
01:13:21,021 --> 01:13:23,107
Maybe you're not even my real brother!

787
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:01,687
What do you think you're doing?
Just stop it, you two!

788
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:22,499
Brother, use your right hand.

789
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:25,794
You're going to ruin your left one.

790
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:04,708
Al, you idiot!

791
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,339
Al, you idiot!

792
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,382
Ed cares about you more than anything!

793
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:16,845
Edward is…

794
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,182
always, constantly thinking about you.

795
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,312
Even when it's just the two of us,

796
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,941
all he does is talk about you.

797
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:31,902
Winry…

798
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:38,283
He believes that…

799
01:15:39,368 --> 01:15:42,496
it's entirely his fault
you lost your body.

800
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:45,541
He's always blamed himself.

801
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:49,545
Don't you know that's the reason

802
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,381
he does all those dangerous things?

803
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:55,592
To get your body back!

804
01:16:00,097 --> 01:16:01,014
Hey!

805
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,851
What idiot would risk his life

806
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:09,147
just to create a fake brother
to torment himself with?

807
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,782
The two of you…

808
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,869
are the only thing the other one has!

809
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:41,722
Hey, Al.

810
01:16:42,264 --> 01:16:43,557
I'm not finished!

811
01:16:54,651 --> 01:16:55,485
Brother.

812
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,446
That hurts.

813
01:16:58,780 --> 01:16:59,740
Liar!

814
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:02,784
You don't feel pain!

815
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:10,959
Brother.

816
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,961
It hurts…

817
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:15,797
to see you hurt.

818
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,819
I'll get your body back, Al.

819
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:41,281
No matter what the cost is.

820
01:17:47,663 --> 01:17:48,622
I promise.

821
01:18:07,599 --> 01:18:09,267
Ishvalan Civil War.

822
01:18:12,145 --> 01:18:13,605
And riots in Reole.

823
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,694
There were riots in the north and the west
as well as border conflicts.

824
01:18:27,452 --> 01:18:28,495
Oh God.

825
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:31,581
Hold on a second.
Now, think. Who's behind this?

826
01:18:33,917 --> 01:18:35,085
Wait a minute.

827
01:18:52,602 --> 01:18:53,937
That's what I thought.

828
01:18:54,855 --> 01:18:57,524
The position of the four laboratories
is strategic.

829
01:18:59,192 --> 01:19:01,278
So it makes sense for Number 5 to be…

830
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:17,753
There you are.

831
01:19:21,298 --> 01:19:22,924
Now you know too much.

832
01:19:35,771 --> 01:19:37,564
The Ouroboros tattoo!

833
01:19:38,899 --> 01:19:42,652
You're the one
who attacked and killed Dr. Marcoh.

834
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:45,155
Hmm.

835
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,241
Nice to meet you.

836
01:19:50,327 --> 01:19:53,038
Or would "goodbye" be more appropriate?

837
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,744
I mistook him for the brainy type.

838
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,665
That was a good fight, Captain.

839
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:44,798
I'm calling from outside
because the internal lines aren't secure!

840
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:48,635
-<i>May I have the security code?</i>
<i>-</i>What a pain in the ass!

841
01:20:48,718 --> 01:20:51,221
Uncle, Sugar, Oliver, eight, zero, zero.

842
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:53,682
<i>Security confirmed, thank you.</i>

843
01:20:53,765 --> 01:20:55,892
<i>I'll put you through to Colonel Mustang.</i>

844
01:20:59,479 --> 01:21:03,358
Damn it, Roy, pick up the phone!
We're all in trouble.

845
01:21:23,879 --> 01:21:24,963
Roy?

846
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,686
What is it?

847
01:21:43,356 --> 01:21:47,068
Come with us. We have orders to escort you
back to Eastern Headquarters.

848
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,450
Is this some kind of an emergency?

849
01:21:57,203 --> 01:21:58,914
What do you think is going on?

850
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:00,415
Brother.

851
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:06,671
Don't worry.
I'll contact you when I know what it is.

852
01:22:33,239 --> 01:22:34,658
What's goin' on?

853
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:41,122
Stand by in this room
until otherwise instructed, sir.

854
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:42,582
What?

855
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,461
You're treating me like a criminal.

856
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,965
I'm not gonna use alchemy in here!

857
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:55,011
They got you too, huh?

858
01:22:56,304 --> 01:22:57,430
Lieutenant.

859
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:00,767
What's goin' on?

860
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:08,149
It's Captain Hughes…

861
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:11,903
He was murdered.

862
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:32,048
All personnel have orders
to arrest the suspect.

863
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,177
Who was the killer?

864
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:46,312
Tell me!

865
01:23:50,775 --> 01:23:52,068
Colonel Mustang.

866
01:24:00,201 --> 01:24:01,786
There were witnesses.

867
01:24:18,928 --> 01:24:23,558
Anyone close to the colonel has been
put under surveillance or detained.

868
01:24:29,564 --> 01:24:30,899
There's one more thing.

869
01:24:32,817 --> 01:24:34,027
Tucker got out.

870
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:40,450
Alphonse! You and I got so close
to finding the truth!

871
01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,952
See you soon!

872
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:46,039
Al…

873
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:52,587
Did Mustang help Tucker escape?

874
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:57,383
Where is he?

875
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:00,637
Where is Colonel Mustang?

876
01:25:02,722 --> 01:25:05,058
No! Don't do it!

877
01:25:11,731 --> 01:25:12,899
Sorry about that.

878
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:17,570
Found it.

879
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:22,742
So Mustang said, "Laboratory Number 5"?

880
01:25:23,243 --> 01:25:25,662
After he finished talking with Hughes,
he hurried out

881
01:25:25,745 --> 01:25:28,164
saying he'd head
for the old prisoner-of-war camp.

882
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:31,584
I thought Lab Number 5
was in that abandoned cannery.

883
01:25:32,168 --> 01:25:35,213
No. Colonel Mustang said that researchers

884
01:25:35,296 --> 01:25:37,966
used to call the prisoner-of-war camp
"Lab Number 5."

885
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:49,394
Fall in!

886
01:25:51,729 --> 01:25:53,481
-Attention!
-Hup!

887
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:11,541
I figured.

888
01:26:18,256 --> 01:26:20,508
Colonel, come with me, please.

889
01:26:22,385 --> 01:26:24,971
It's you, Lieutenant Ross…

890
01:26:25,805 --> 01:26:29,184
I'm under orders to arrest you
for the murder of Captain Hughes.

891
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:33,730
Heavy security detail
for an abandoned prison.

892
01:26:35,440 --> 01:26:37,650
I wonder how you knew I'd come here.

893
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:42,280
Don't move, or I shoot.

894
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,536
Please don't make me.
It's shoot to kill if you resist.

895
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,209
Colonel, last warning! Don't!

896
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:03,927
Colonel, don't do it!

897
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:50,265
Ross…

898
01:27:52,517 --> 01:27:53,810
Don't panic.

899
01:27:58,022 --> 01:27:59,524
That was damn hot.

900
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:24,173
How did you know?

901
01:28:26,009 --> 01:28:29,387
The mole on Ross's face. Wrong side.

902
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:34,183
Ah, is that right?

903
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,271
I got that wrong.

904
01:28:51,617 --> 01:28:54,329
Hey! I've been exposed, Lust.

905
01:28:55,455 --> 01:28:56,664
So I see.

906
01:28:57,957 --> 01:28:59,042
Yes, you have.

907
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,758
Hey, wait! I know you!

908
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,178
Oh. Hi, Fullmetal boy.

909
01:29:12,638 --> 01:29:13,848
Thanks for remembering.

910
01:29:17,435 --> 01:29:19,062
The Ouroboros tattoos.

911
01:29:21,814 --> 01:29:24,609
FullMetal, they aren't really human.

912
01:29:25,902 --> 01:29:26,986
Homunculi.

913
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:31,032
They are… artificial humans.

914
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:34,327
Homunculi?

915
01:29:38,331 --> 01:29:40,541
You did your homework well.

916
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:45,171
Do you know Maes Hughes, by chance?

917
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,174
I know him well.

918
01:29:49,967 --> 01:29:52,512
He was a smart man, and very gifted.

919
01:29:53,596 --> 01:29:54,514
It's a shame…

920
01:29:55,973 --> 01:29:58,601
I didn't get the chance
to finish him off myself.

921
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:15,201
<i>Hello? Is this Hughes?</i>
<i>What's wrong?</i>

922
01:30:16,285 --> 01:30:17,120
<i>Answer me.</i>

923
01:30:20,373 --> 01:30:21,332
Who are you?

924
01:30:23,167 --> 01:30:24,085
Tell me.

925
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:33,511
Nice touch, isn't it?

926
01:30:39,934 --> 01:30:42,228
<i>Hughes, what's wrong?</i>

927
01:30:48,609 --> 01:30:50,820
<i>Hold on. I'll be right there. Hughes!</i>

928
01:30:51,654 --> 01:30:54,240
Lab… Number 5.

929
01:30:57,326 --> 01:31:00,788
Old… prisoner-of-war camp.

930
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:03,249
<i> Hughes…</i>

931
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,126
<i>Hughes!</i>

932
01:31:06,377 --> 01:31:07,670
<i>Answer me! Hughes!</i>

933
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,506
<i>Hughes. Hughes!</i>

934
01:31:11,382 --> 01:31:12,842
<i>Hughes!</i>

935
01:31:17,597 --> 01:31:22,268
My plan was to frame you,
as the military conspirator,

936
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:27,190
and then afterwards, finish you off,
like your friend Hughes.

937
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:32,320
Get on your knees!

938
01:31:36,449 --> 01:31:39,285
I would never kneel down before you.

939
01:31:47,585 --> 01:31:48,961
No mercy.

940
01:31:50,296 --> 01:31:53,007
No wonder you're a hero
of the Ishvalan Civil War.

941
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:07,271
You're the ones
who helped Shou Tucker escape!

942
01:32:10,066 --> 01:32:11,484
So, what is it you want?

943
01:32:12,527 --> 01:32:13,528
Tucker?

944
01:32:15,404 --> 01:32:17,365
The chimera professor broke out?

945
01:32:19,283 --> 01:32:22,995
Damn it. That bastard deserved to rot.

946
01:32:24,121 --> 01:32:25,122
Envy!

947
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:36,634
Gluttony. You can eat all of them,

948
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:39,637
except FullMetal boy.

949
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,644
She said that I could eat you all!

950
01:33:17,049 --> 01:33:18,634
Colonel!

951
01:33:24,974 --> 01:33:28,477
Even the Flame Alchemist has a soft spot.

952
01:33:38,654 --> 01:33:39,614
FullMetal.

953
01:33:40,239 --> 01:33:41,657
You have to stop them.

954
01:33:43,284 --> 01:33:46,329
We'll be fine. Just go!

955
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,224
-Al!
-Brother, don't come up here!

956
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,023
Not so fast, Ed.

957
01:34:59,652 --> 01:35:01,278
If you come any closer…

958
01:35:05,157 --> 01:35:07,326
I'll put a hole in her forehead.

959
01:35:08,536 --> 01:35:11,330
I'm sorry, Ed. I couldn't protect her.

960
01:35:13,416 --> 01:35:15,334
Tucker, you bastard.

961
01:35:16,335 --> 01:35:18,754
I'll rip you into pieces if you hurt them!

962
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:26,262
You're always so violent!

963
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:31,100
First, I'll ask you
to remove your right arm.

964
01:35:31,767 --> 01:35:32,852
Huh?

965
01:35:35,062 --> 01:35:37,857
Your alchemy is too dangerous
for me to ignore.

966
01:35:43,154 --> 01:35:44,029
Stop.

967
01:35:44,113 --> 01:35:45,489
Hurry up!

968
01:36:17,104 --> 01:36:19,315
I really should start by thanking you.

969
01:36:20,065 --> 01:36:24,069
I mean, after all, I learned the secret
of harnessing a soul to an object.

970
01:36:24,153 --> 01:36:25,571
by studying your handiwork.

971
01:36:27,448 --> 01:36:28,407
I, uh--

972
01:36:29,700 --> 01:36:34,246
I guess actually, I should be thanking
your younger brother over here.

973
01:36:36,957 --> 01:36:38,834
I asked him to take a look for me,

974
01:36:40,211 --> 01:36:41,587
inside the Gate of Truth.

975
01:36:48,302 --> 01:36:49,678
You've got what you want.

976
01:36:51,722 --> 01:36:53,224
Why don't you let them go?

977
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,234
Can you tell what this is?

978
01:37:06,612 --> 01:37:08,030
The Philosopher's Stone.

979
01:37:09,824 --> 01:37:10,991
That's correct.

980
01:37:12,660 --> 01:37:13,994
I hold in my hand

981
01:37:14,954 --> 01:37:16,872
the true Philosopher's Stone,

982
01:37:17,373 --> 01:37:19,291
the object of your obsession.

983
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:28,050
Look down at the floor,
what you're standing on.

984
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,403
The circle to transmute the stone.

985
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:50,447
But that says…

986
01:37:53,409 --> 01:37:54,535
Oh, no.

987
01:37:58,706 --> 01:37:59,957
That's impossible!

988
01:38:05,462 --> 01:38:07,006
That's why you're a genius.

989
01:38:08,257 --> 01:38:11,510
Just like that, you understand
precisely what this circle means.

990
01:38:11,594 --> 01:38:14,263
-It can't be.
-Yes, it can, and it is.

991
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:19,518
This place has an abundance of material.

992
01:38:20,436 --> 01:38:24,523
You know, of course,
this used to be a prisoner-of-war camp.

993
01:38:26,734 --> 01:38:27,860
It's…

994
01:38:28,819 --> 01:38:31,530
To transmute
the Philosopher's Stone…

995
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:36,535
you need living humans!

996
01:39:32,633 --> 01:39:36,720
These are the Philosopher's Stones
that Marcoh and his colleagues transmuted!

997
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,814
What have you done?

998
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:52,486
You accused me
of toying with lives.

999
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:58,200
But when you compare it to what they did,
I'm just tinkering!

1000
01:39:59,368 --> 01:40:02,204
See? Isn't that right?

1001
01:40:03,330 --> 01:40:05,290
Am I right, FullMetal Alchemist?

1002
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:09,795
But why?

1003
01:40:12,548 --> 01:40:14,842
What would they ever do this for?

1004
01:40:16,218 --> 01:40:17,428
I wondered, too.

1005
01:40:18,595 --> 01:40:20,806
And there are so many of them!

1006
01:40:24,768 --> 01:40:25,978
I'm not interested…

1007
01:40:28,188 --> 01:40:30,816
in the slightest in these little pebbles.

1008
01:40:32,901 --> 01:40:37,114
But I do have one personal wish.

1009
01:40:39,366 --> 01:40:44,163
I'd like to see you fail
to fulfill your brilliant promises.

1010
01:40:46,749 --> 01:40:53,547
It would be the kind of supreme pleasure
only a superior man could enjoy!

1011
01:40:54,673 --> 01:41:00,637
My gift to you is to put an end
to your miserable little quest.

1012
01:41:16,695 --> 01:41:18,697
Is anything worse than a chatty man?

1013
01:41:43,680 --> 01:41:45,891
This is not what I ordered you to do.

1014
01:41:51,146 --> 01:41:53,899
You know, looking down at a lady
the way you're doing

1015
01:41:55,025 --> 01:41:56,693
is very unsophisticated.

1016
01:42:10,415 --> 01:42:11,500
General Hakuro.

1017
01:42:12,751 --> 01:42:15,879
I showed you the secret
of how to make the Philosopher's Stone.

1018
01:42:16,672 --> 01:42:18,966
But I won't show you how to use them.

1019
01:42:20,259 --> 01:42:21,218
You won't?

1020
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:23,679
I don't need you to.

1021
01:42:24,555 --> 01:42:27,933
The brilliant Mr. Tucker
solved that particular mystery for me.

1022
01:42:29,351 --> 01:42:30,310
Oh, did he, now?

1023
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:35,107
The government deemed him worthless,

1024
01:42:35,858 --> 01:42:38,694
but I was smart enough to know
that they were incorrect.

1025
01:42:42,573 --> 01:42:45,159
General Hakuro, what's goin' on here?

1026
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:52,124
Do you know why the military
prohibited human transmutation?

1027
01:42:52,833 --> 01:42:56,336
Of course.
Because it's immoral and unethical.

1028
01:42:57,796 --> 01:42:59,798
Correct, that's the official reason.

1029
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:02,551
The real reason is

1030
01:43:03,051 --> 01:43:07,264
because it would allow a person
to create an infinite amount of soldiers.

1031
01:43:08,473 --> 01:43:10,058
If you were to do that,

1032
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:13,187
a single person could form
a powerful military force.

1033
01:43:17,024 --> 01:43:20,694
Let me show you
what the military feared the most.

1034
01:43:43,258 --> 01:43:45,844
I seriously doubt
you can handle those babies.

1035
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:49,598
Well, I assure you that I can.

1036
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:52,559
I saw Tucker doing a wonderful job.

1037
01:43:54,144 --> 01:43:55,646
And what about your plan?

1038
01:43:56,271 --> 01:43:59,942
Did you think you could rule over humans
with those, homunculus?

1039
01:44:02,069 --> 01:44:04,279
Are you thinking of disobeying orders?

1040
01:44:05,822 --> 01:44:08,992
I know that you are controlling
some higher-ups in the military,

1041
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:11,870
but no one gives me orders anymore.

1042
01:44:12,913 --> 01:44:17,125
Now, each Philosopher's Stone
injects a soul into each dummy,

1043
01:44:17,668 --> 01:44:20,295
and they become
the world's toughest soldiers.

1044
01:44:20,879 --> 01:44:23,090
They feel no fear, they feel no pain.

1045
01:44:23,173 --> 01:44:27,511
And when I am finished,
I will have an unstoppable army,

1046
01:44:27,594 --> 01:44:29,513
made of invincible soldiers!

1047
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:32,724
Crazy, selfish bastard!

1048
01:44:33,976 --> 01:44:38,480
All those human lives, so you can
build an army with these dummies.

1049
01:44:39,648 --> 01:44:41,108
Well, I won't let you.

1050
01:46:18,747 --> 01:46:22,042
With my army, I will rule the world!

1051
01:46:37,015 --> 01:46:38,934
Papa. Papa.

1052
01:46:40,394 --> 01:46:41,395
That's right.

1053
01:46:42,604 --> 01:46:44,356
Come to your papa, my children.

1054
01:46:45,857 --> 01:46:47,192
Papa.

1055
01:46:47,692 --> 01:46:48,860
Papa.

1056
01:46:48,944 --> 01:46:50,946
Papa. Papa.

1057
01:46:56,827 --> 01:46:58,328
Papa.

1058
01:46:59,246 --> 01:47:00,831
Papa.

1059
01:47:01,748 --> 01:47:03,458
Papa.

1060
01:47:22,936 --> 01:47:26,356
I told you. Now, what are you gonna do
with all these dummies, huh?

1061
01:47:26,440 --> 01:47:28,733
Ugh, that guy really screwed up our plan.

1062
01:47:30,318 --> 01:47:31,403
Hmph.

1063
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:34,489
There really is no end
to their foolishness.

1064
01:47:36,366 --> 01:47:38,243
Papa…

1065
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:42,873
Gluttony.

1066
01:47:45,500 --> 01:47:47,002
Can I eat them?

1067
01:47:47,502 --> 01:47:48,336
Yes.

1068
01:47:51,131 --> 01:47:53,383
And don't leave any leftovers.

1069
01:48:03,685 --> 01:48:04,811
Stand back!

1070
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:15,614
Inform the soldiers outside.
Stop them. Do not let them escape.

1071
01:48:16,448 --> 01:48:19,242
If any get out,
the public will be at risk.

1072
01:48:19,910 --> 01:48:20,952
But how?

1073
01:48:21,036 --> 01:48:23,038
Papa. Papa.

1074
01:48:24,539 --> 01:48:25,624
Target their heads.

1075
01:48:26,583 --> 01:48:28,627
Papa. Papa.

1076
01:48:29,252 --> 01:48:32,130
Target their heads. Now go!

1077
01:48:32,214 --> 01:48:33,548
Papa. Papa.

1078
01:48:52,192 --> 01:48:54,903
Papa. Papa. Papa.

1079
01:48:56,196 --> 01:48:59,324
I… can't move my body.

1080
01:49:03,328 --> 01:49:04,454
Move it!

1081
01:49:09,209 --> 01:49:11,002
Stay away from my brother!

1082
01:49:11,586 --> 01:49:12,796
Brother!

1083
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:25,976
Papa. Papa…

1084
01:49:26,059 --> 01:49:27,727
-Ed, I'm sorry.
-Papa…

1085
01:49:27,811 --> 01:49:29,020
I messed up…

1086
01:49:30,188 --> 01:49:31,982
-No, you didn't.
-Winry!

1087
01:49:34,734 --> 01:49:37,362
It's 'cause I got caught that Al couldn't…

1088
01:49:39,531 --> 01:49:43,201
Later. I've got to get those homunculi.

1089
01:49:43,285 --> 01:49:45,745
Al, can you stop those creatures
from gettin' out?

1090
01:49:45,829 --> 01:49:46,913
I'll try.

1091
01:49:47,539 --> 01:49:50,625
Winry, remount this. Do your best.

1092
01:49:53,962 --> 01:49:54,796
You got it.

1093
01:50:11,646 --> 01:50:12,480
Damn it!

1094
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,733
Now you've pissed me off.

1095
01:50:18,320 --> 01:50:21,448
You won't get away with what you've done!

1096
01:50:28,955 --> 01:50:32,000
So you seared your wound
to stop the breeding.

1097
01:50:32,083 --> 01:50:33,627
Very resourceful.

1098
01:50:34,961 --> 01:50:37,631
I almost fainted
a few times doing it.

1099
01:50:38,798 --> 01:50:42,677
But I can't die until…
the last of you is down.

1100
01:50:44,429 --> 01:50:46,598
How many times do I have to stab you

1101
01:50:47,766 --> 01:50:49,726
before you shut up and die?

1102
01:51:16,127 --> 01:51:18,838
No leftovers, she said!

1103
01:51:23,259 --> 01:51:24,344
Attention!

1104
01:51:28,181 --> 01:51:30,433
Target their heads.
That's how you kill them.

1105
01:51:31,309 --> 01:51:32,852
Do not let any of them out!

1106
01:51:33,353 --> 01:51:34,270
Yes!

1107
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,336
Fire!

1108
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:25,196
This time,
I'll punch so many holes in you,

1109
01:52:26,698 --> 01:52:29,951
you'll have to sear your whole body
to stop the bleeding.

1110
01:52:55,643 --> 01:52:58,188
Well done, FullMetal boy.

1111
01:53:00,732 --> 01:53:03,485
I'll reveal my secret as a reward.

1112
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,830
We're man-made.

1113
01:53:16,748 --> 01:53:20,168
The Philosopher's Stone
is the core of our existence.

1114
01:53:20,251 --> 01:53:23,797
No matter how many times we die,
the Stone resurrects us.

1115
01:53:25,423 --> 01:53:26,883
So you're immortal.

1116
01:53:30,136 --> 01:53:31,554
You monsters.

1117
01:53:33,181 --> 01:53:34,599
Don't be rude.

1118
01:53:35,725 --> 01:53:38,019
We don't look any different
compared to you.

1119
01:53:38,520 --> 01:53:42,482
We have senses, emotions,
affection for our creator.

1120
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:46,861
We're human.

1121
01:53:49,030 --> 01:53:50,365
You bastard.

1122
01:53:51,825 --> 01:53:54,494
You burned me to death, over and over.

1123
01:53:57,413 --> 01:53:59,749
But that's not enough to kill me yet.

1124
01:54:01,000 --> 01:54:04,295
You're an important candidate
for the sacrifice, FullMetal boy.

1125
01:54:05,004 --> 01:54:06,381
But unfortunately,

1126
01:54:06,965 --> 01:54:08,216
we can't let you live.

1127
01:54:23,231 --> 01:54:24,190
Colonel.

1128
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:25,984
You noticed too?

1129
01:54:29,904 --> 01:54:33,783
Looks to me like it's taking longer
and longer for the skinny one to recover.

1130
01:54:34,492 --> 01:54:36,369
I was wondering why
the woman with the tattoo

1131
01:54:36,452 --> 01:54:38,746
was stalling me
with meaningless explanations.

1132
01:54:40,832 --> 01:54:42,542
You said, "Not enough to kill me yet."

1133
01:54:43,501 --> 01:54:47,964
Now, to me, that makes it sound like
you have a limited number of lives.

1134
01:54:50,675 --> 01:54:52,260
Perhaps your slow recovery

1135
01:54:53,136 --> 01:54:56,139
implies that you're gettin' close
to reaching your limit.

1136
01:55:00,685 --> 01:55:01,895
Am I right?

1137
01:55:02,854 --> 01:55:06,441
I bet you're on… your last life.

1138
01:56:12,507 --> 01:56:14,550
I won't go easy on you now.

1139
01:56:15,385 --> 01:56:16,302
Damn it.

1140
01:56:19,722 --> 01:56:21,724
Go ahead.
I'm taking FullMetal boy with me.

1141
01:56:49,961 --> 01:56:52,880
How about that? You have a weakness too.

1142
01:56:56,968 --> 01:56:58,177
Take this!

1143
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:13,192
I finally brought you to your knees,
homunculus.

1144
01:57:17,822 --> 01:57:21,451
How many times do I have to burn you
before you shut up and die?

1145
01:57:26,122 --> 01:57:28,541
I'll kill you until you're dead for good!

1146
01:57:49,687 --> 01:57:51,564
This one is for Hughes.

1147
01:58:06,454 --> 01:58:07,622
<i>I can…</i>

1148
01:58:09,999 --> 01:58:10,958
<i>die.</i>

1149
01:58:14,295 --> 01:58:15,880
<i>I can die, just…</i>

1150
01:58:18,508 --> 01:58:19,759
<i>like a human.</i>

1151
01:58:40,988 --> 01:58:42,240
Colonel!

1152
01:58:48,162 --> 01:58:49,455
FullMetal.

1153
01:59:17,024 --> 01:59:19,152
Lust is dead.

1154
02:00:03,029 --> 02:00:06,157
Brother? Is that the…

1155
02:00:19,003 --> 02:00:19,837
Yeah.

1156
02:00:20,922 --> 02:00:22,840
This is the Philosopher's Stone.

1157
02:00:25,551 --> 02:00:27,803
We've looked for it relentlessly
for so long.

1158
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:30,848
We finally have it.

1159
02:00:33,726 --> 02:00:35,061
And now that it's ours…

1160
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:43,194
I can't believe…

1161
02:00:47,114 --> 02:00:49,075
I can't believe how they made it!

1162
02:01:09,262 --> 02:01:10,263
Brother.

1163
02:01:12,556 --> 02:01:15,518
Please, Ed, no. Don't do it!

1164
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:18,604
That stone is human life!

1165
02:01:21,482 --> 02:01:22,984
Brother!

1166
02:01:32,702 --> 02:01:35,579
<i>How have you been, alchemist?</i>

1167
02:01:43,170 --> 02:01:45,589
<i>So, you came back</i>
<i>with the proper toll this time.</i>

1168
02:02:00,271 --> 02:02:04,025
Al. So you were here the whole time.

1169
02:02:07,403 --> 02:02:08,863
You've gotten so thin.

1170
02:02:17,788 --> 02:02:20,958
<i>Now, let's make the exchange.</i>

1171
02:02:44,774 --> 02:02:48,319
Al. I'll come back for you,
no matter what.

1172
02:02:49,570 --> 02:02:50,613
I promise.

1173
02:03:08,422 --> 02:03:11,384
Al!

1174
02:03:28,401 --> 02:03:29,402
<i>Brother?</i>

1175
02:03:31,445 --> 02:03:32,405
<i>Brother!</i>

1176
02:03:54,385 --> 02:03:55,261
Al.

1177
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,974
I'm sorry.

1178
02:04:03,436 --> 02:04:04,645
Please forgive me.

1179
02:04:09,775 --> 02:04:11,777
It's okay, You did the right thing.

1180
02:04:18,242 --> 02:04:20,494
I don't want it
at the price of another life.

1181
02:04:21,579 --> 02:04:23,289
I'd rather stay like this.

1182
02:04:26,208 --> 02:04:27,126
Yeah…

1183
02:04:43,309 --> 02:04:44,351
But, Al…

1184
02:04:47,605 --> 02:04:49,315
your body was actually there.

1185
02:04:51,108 --> 02:04:52,318
Really.

1186
02:04:55,321 --> 02:04:57,031
It's really there. I saw it.

1187
02:04:59,742 --> 02:05:00,868
That's great.

1188
02:05:02,411 --> 02:05:03,871
It really exists?

1189
02:05:06,999 --> 02:05:08,959
Did I… look all right?

1190
02:05:12,630 --> 02:05:13,464
Yeah.

1191
02:05:15,716 --> 02:05:17,927
You were all grown up there,
I was surprised.

1192
02:05:20,304 --> 02:05:22,681
Ed, was I taller than you?

1193
02:05:25,476 --> 02:05:26,435
Hmm.

1194
02:05:27,895 --> 02:05:29,688
Uh-huh.

1195
02:05:30,981 --> 02:05:32,399
You're taller than me.

1196
02:05:34,777 --> 02:05:35,819
I am?

1197
02:05:37,696 --> 02:05:38,948
Aren't I great?

1198
02:06:17,027 --> 02:06:21,657
Colonel. I want you to climb the ranks.

1199
02:06:23,158 --> 02:06:26,829
All the way up,
so you can get to the bottom of this.

1200
02:06:28,622 --> 02:06:30,291
Hughes would want the same thing.

1201
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:36,255
That's always been my intention.

1202
02:07:23,052 --> 02:07:26,138
-Eeny, meeny, minie, mo.
-Oh. Oops!

1203
02:07:27,765 --> 02:07:29,475
-I choose you!
-All right!

1204
02:07:31,727 --> 02:07:32,936
Yes!

1205
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,314
Oh, man.

1206
02:07:41,612 --> 02:07:43,113
<i>I'll keep my promise, Al.</i>

1207
02:07:44,406 --> 02:07:45,866
<i>I'll find another way</i>

1208
02:07:47,201 --> 02:07:49,119
<i>to get your body back.</i>
