1
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,875
OK, I'll go first.

2
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:44,212
Let me say, we don't really need to be here.

3
00:00:45,422 --> 00:00:48,633
- See, we've been married five years.
- Six.

4
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:53,638
Five, six years.
And this is like a check-up for us.

5
00:00:54,639 --> 00:00:59,603
Chance to poke around the engine,
maybe change the oil.

6
00:00:59,686 --> 00:01:03,773
- Replace a seal or two.
- Yeah, that's it.

7
00:01:04,733 --> 00:01:07,110
Very well, then. Let's pop the hood.

8
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,489
On a scale of one to ten,
how happy a couple are you?

9
00:01:11,573 --> 00:01:13,867
- Eight.
- Wait.

10
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,371
Ten being perfectly happy
and one being totally miserable, or...

11
00:01:18,455 --> 00:01:21,625
- Just respond instinctively.
- OK.

12
00:01:22,626 --> 00:01:24,085
Ready?

13
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:25,503
Eight.

14
00:01:28,548 --> 00:01:31,217
How often do you have sex?

15
00:01:31,301 --> 00:01:34,262
I don't understand the question.

16
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:37,307
Yeah, I'm lost. Is this a one to ten thing?

17
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,519
But, because, is, like, one very little,
or is one nothing? Because...

18
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:46,066
You know, technically speaking,
the zero would be nothing.

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,405
How about this week?

20
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:58,536
- Including the weekend?
- Sure.

21
00:02:04,751 --> 00:02:07,254
Describe how you first met.

22
00:02:07,337 --> 00:02:11,299
- It was in Colombia.
- Bogotá.

23
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:13,510
Five years ago.

24
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:15,220
Six.

25
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,639
Right. Five or six years ago.

26
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,407
<i>... todas las habitaciones.</i>

27
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:37,951
<i>Hey. ¿ Qué pasa?</i>

28
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:48,753
<i>Vamos, muchachos.
Registren los elevadores y los escalones.</i>

29
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:55,010
<i>¿Anda solo?</i>

30
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,390
<i>Papeles.</i>

31
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:01,933
<i>Señora.</i>

32
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:09,608
<i>- ¿Está sola?
- No.</i>

33
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:14,237
<i>- No, no, no, no, no.
- Está bien.</i>

34
00:03:14,321 --> 00:03:17,115
<i>She's with me. Está bien.</i>

35
00:03:19,242 --> 00:03:21,995
<i>Abren. Sus papeles.</i>

36
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,460
I'm Jane.

37
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:32,005
- John.
- Nice to meet you.

38
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:34,424
Nice to meet you.

39
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,181
- To dodging bullets.
- Dodging bullets.

40
00:03:46,603 --> 00:03:49,022
So it speaks.

41
00:03:49,105 --> 00:03:51,399
But does it dance?

42
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:40,967
Hiya, stranger.

43
00:05:41,051 --> 00:05:43,428
Hiya back.

44
00:05:44,971 --> 00:05:47,182
I think room service fled.

45
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:49,893
I did what I could.

46
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,312
Thank you.

47
00:05:55,273 --> 00:05:57,567
Oh, that's good.

48
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:00,946
I hope so. I had to milk a goat to get it.

49
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:41,695
Hey, step right up,
ladies and gentlemen. Try your luck.

50
00:06:41,778 --> 00:06:46,533
How about you, little lady?
Wanna try your luck? Win a prize?

51
00:06:46,616 --> 00:06:48,994
Yeah, all right.

52
00:06:51,329 --> 00:06:54,624
- Two.
- We got two over here.

53
00:06:55,542 --> 00:06:58,753
- You know how to hold it?
- Step right up, have a shot.

54
00:06:58,837 --> 00:06:59,838
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

55
00:06:59,921 --> 00:07:01,923
Yeah.

56
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:06,678
- You gotta aim it.
- I am.

57
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:10,015
Don't laugh, I'll kill you.

58
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:13,727
You didn't blink.

59
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:22,777
Do we still get something?

60
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,155
Beginner's luck.

61
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:29,242
- I want to go again.
- Going again.

62
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:43,924
Where'd you learn to shoot like that?

63
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,301
Beginner's luck.

64
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,556
Stop. Stop,
you've only known the girl for six weeks.

65
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,476
I'm in love. She's smart, sexy.

66
00:07:55,018 --> 00:08:00,899
She's uninhibited, spontaneous, complicated.
She's the sweetest thing I've ever seen.

67
00:08:00,982 --> 00:08:04,027
I knew Gladys two and a half years
before I asked her to marry me.

68
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:10,075
You have to have a foundation of friendship,
brother. The other stuff fades.

69
00:08:10,158 --> 00:08:11,201
Hi.

70
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:21,044
So you don't think
this is all happening a little fast?

71
00:08:21,127 --> 00:08:24,130
You know I never do anything
without thinking it through.

72
00:08:24,214 --> 00:08:29,719
- What does he do?
- He's in construction. Big-time contractor.

73
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:35,392
A server goes down on Wall Street.
She's there, anytime, day or night.

74
00:08:38,144 --> 00:08:40,438
She's like Batman for computers.

75
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:44,359
He's gone as much as I am, so it's perfect.

76
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,530
I give the whole thing six months, tops.

77
00:08:48,613 --> 00:08:50,448
Eddie?

78
00:08:50,532 --> 00:08:52,784
I asked her to marry me.

79
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,744
What?

80
00:08:54,828 --> 00:08:58,456
- I'm getting married!
- What? I can't hear you.

81
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,667
- Getting married.
- I can't hear.

82
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:04,170
- Stop hitting him, he said something crazy.
- I'm getting married.

83
00:09:45,921 --> 00:09:49,382
- Gotta get these filters changed.
- What did you think of Dr Wexler?

84
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,093
His questions were a bit wishy-washy.

85
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:56,014
Yeah. Watch your arm.
Not the most insightful.

86
00:09:57,015 --> 00:09:59,267
And his office is clear across town.

87
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:04,856
Well, you know the four o'clock means
we hit rush hour. Not crazy about that.

88
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:07,525
- So that's settled then, yeah?
- OK.

89
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:12,906
OK.

90
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:15,033
Dinner's at seven.

91
00:10:15,116 --> 00:10:17,452
Yup. I'll be there. Here.

92
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,771
Anybody calls,
I'm in with the boss. OK?

93
00:10:44,854 --> 00:10:49,067
Got a call from the man. Big highline
assignment, Steve. You know how it is.

94
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,444
Actually, you probably don't.
Sweetie?

95
00:10:51,528 --> 00:10:55,198
Could you grab me a coffee?
I like it with lots of sugar. Thanks a lot.

96
00:10:55,282 --> 00:10:57,617
Hey there.

97
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:03,206
And where do you think you're going?

98
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:07,043
Well, I was... The boss wants to see me.

99
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:09,170
Well, he sees you.

100
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:13,717
<i>Look, kid, people who've been
working here for 25 years</i>

101
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,094
have never seen inside of that elevator.

102
00:11:16,177 --> 00:11:18,096
Here.

103
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:25,437
This is the assignment?

104
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,897
Now get outta here.

105
00:12:22,702 --> 00:12:24,788
- Hey, babe.
- Perfect timing.

106
00:12:24,871 --> 00:12:27,207
It's pissing rain out there.

107
00:12:29,501 --> 00:12:32,170
Gardener left the lawnmower out.

108
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:38,802
- How was work?
- Ah, so-so.

109
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,096
Oh, I got new curtains.

110
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:43,014
Did you?

111
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:45,850
Well?

112
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,272
What do you think?

113
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:58,363
There was a struggle over the material.
This tea sandwich of a man,

114
00:12:58,446 --> 00:13:00,448
he got his hands on them first.

115
00:13:00,532 --> 00:13:02,534
- But I won.
- Of course you did.

116
00:13:02,617 --> 00:13:07,330
They're a bit green, so we have to reupholster
the sofas and get a new rug. Maybe a Persian.

117
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:12,669
Yeah, or we can just keep the old ones,
then we don't have to change a thing.

118
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:15,672
We talked about this. You remember?

119
00:13:18,967 --> 00:13:22,512
I remember.
I remember cos we said we'd wait.

120
00:13:23,847 --> 00:13:27,058
If you don't like 'em, we can take 'em back.

121
00:13:27,142 --> 00:13:30,270
OK. I don't like 'em.

122
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:33,481
You'll get used to 'em.

123
00:13:33,565 --> 00:13:34,941
Yeah.

124
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,269
Zero per cent APR till March.

125
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:16,399
So, part two. Here we are.

126
00:14:16,483 --> 00:14:19,736
Only this time, you came back alone.
Why did you come back?

127
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:22,113
I'm not sure, really.

128
00:14:23,031 --> 00:14:25,408
Let me clarify, I love my wife.

129
00:14:26,952 --> 00:14:29,246
I want her to be happy.

130
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:31,665
I want good things for her.

131
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,252
But there are times...

132
00:14:54,604 --> 00:14:57,732
- Honey, would you just...
- Five more minutes.

133
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:02,070
There's this huge space between us.

134
00:15:02,153 --> 00:15:07,867
And it just keeps filling up with
everything that we don't say to each other.

135
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:11,079
- What is that called?
- Marriage.

136
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,708
What don't you say to each other?

137
00:15:20,797 --> 00:15:23,842
<i>James of the Yukon got three stars.</i>

138
00:15:24,718 --> 00:15:27,804
This looks nice.
Did you do something new?

139
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,724
Yeah?

140
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,436
- I added peas.
- Yeah, peas.

141
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:39,774
Yeah, it's the green.

142
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:43,653
Sweetheart, will you pass the salt?

143
00:15:43,737 --> 00:15:46,406
It's in the middle of the table.

144
00:15:47,365 --> 00:15:52,787
- Is that the middle of the table?
- Yeah, it's between you and me.

145
00:15:55,457 --> 00:15:58,627
- How honest are you with him?
- Pretty honest.

146
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:00,170
I mean...

147
00:16:00,253 --> 00:16:04,341
It's not like I lie to him or anything.
We just...

148
00:16:04,424 --> 00:16:08,219
I have little secrets.
Everybody has secrets.

149
00:16:29,491 --> 00:16:32,452
Jesus! Honey, you scared me.

150
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:35,830
I'm sorry, hon. I was looking for the...

151
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:38,875
You going out?

152
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:44,005
Yes. Some clown crashed a server in a law
firm downtown and ended the world, so yes.

153
00:16:47,217 --> 00:16:49,803
We promised the Colemans.

154
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:51,346
- I know.
- OK.

155
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:54,975
I'll be there. In and out. Just a quickie.

156
00:17:04,276 --> 00:17:07,821
Probably feels like
you're the only people going through this,

157
00:17:07,904 --> 00:17:13,201
but there are millions of couples
that are experiencing the same problems.

158
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:59,664
- We got a plane in an hour.
- All right.

159
00:17:59,748 --> 00:18:03,877
- Who's Al Gore? "Quotes", 800.
- Prodded about possible insider trading,

160
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,465
she remarked on national television,
"I want to focus on my salad." Ryan?

161
00:18:08,548 --> 00:18:10,550
- Martha Stewart.
- Martha Stewart?

162
00:18:10,634 --> 00:18:14,262
- "Quotes" for 1000.
- Regarding Mick Jagger's knighthood,

163
00:18:14,346 --> 00:18:19,059
he scoffed, "It's a paltry honour, mate.
Hold out for the lordship."

164
00:18:40,956 --> 00:18:45,252
- 40.
- All right. I'll match you...

165
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:48,046
What the hell?
What's this shite?

166
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:52,926
Sorry. Where's the can around here?
Chrissake...

167
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:55,345
Take a... Hey, you guys playing poker?

168
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:59,349
- Private game. Piss off.
- Could I sit in? You think I could...

169
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:01,977
What part of "piss off'
do you not understand?

170
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,063
Guys... Whoa, be a little friendly.
I got the cash...

171
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:07,274
Easy, big feller.

172
00:19:07,983 --> 00:19:10,777
That's cool, man. You're cool.

173
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,780
Lis... Look, see?
You see what I'm saying?

174
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:17,701
See what I'm saying?
Anyone interested?

175
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:21,955
Nah. Cos I'll clean you out.
I understand. Fine.

176
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:26,585
Listen, I want...
Those are really nice shoes, man.

177
00:19:30,088 --> 00:19:31,881
Jesus!

178
00:19:31,965 --> 00:19:35,594
- Here's an empty chair. I could sit here...
- That is Lucky's chair.

179
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:38,138
Where's Lucky? I don't see Lucky.

180
00:19:38,221 --> 00:19:41,641
- Lucky's not back yet.
- Then I'll sit here.

181
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:43,852
Unless...

182
00:19:43,935 --> 00:19:45,979
I'm too hot for you.

183
00:20:25,518 --> 00:20:28,647
- Solid silver.
- Ooh, very sweet.

184
00:20:30,148 --> 00:20:32,359
"To dodging bullets. Love, Jane."

185
00:20:32,442 --> 00:20:34,736
In the pot. Put it in the pot.

186
00:20:36,363 --> 00:20:39,115
Oh, he's pulled something.

187
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:40,575
You're in trouble now.

188
00:20:40,659 --> 00:20:44,246
- $60, eh?
- In.

189
00:20:45,497 --> 00:20:49,542
Look at the big man over there!

190
00:20:49,626 --> 00:20:51,962
Let's play some poker!

191
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:56,383
- Fives.
- He's got 14 different tells!

192
00:20:56,466 --> 00:20:58,677
You are bleeding William Tell.

193
00:21:04,182 --> 00:21:07,018
- What the hell is this?
- Sorry, Lucky.

194
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,521
You're done, pal.
Thanks for the memories.

195
00:21:09,604 --> 00:21:11,856
Oh, you Lucky? No kidding.

196
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,567
What is it, kid?
You looking for ajob or something?

197
00:21:14,651 --> 00:21:16,695
You are the job.

198
00:21:32,168 --> 00:21:34,546
Pair of threes.

199
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:41,761
- Have you been a bad boy?
- Yes.

200
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:50,103
You know what happens to bad boys?

201
00:21:51,605 --> 00:21:55,108
- They get punished.
- Ooh, yeah. Punish me.

202
00:21:59,195 --> 00:22:02,365
Have you been selling
big guns to bad people?

203
00:22:10,248 --> 00:22:12,417
Mister Racin?

204
00:22:13,293 --> 00:22:15,629
Mister Racin? You OK?

205
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,591
Oh, the Colemans.

206
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,307
He's down!

207
00:22:44,783 --> 00:22:47,118
Taxi?

208
00:23:07,347 --> 00:23:12,394
- Hey, hon.
- Hey, baby. I didn't hear you downstairs.

209
00:23:12,477 --> 00:23:15,897
Yeah, I went to the sports bar.
Put some money on the game.

210
00:23:15,981 --> 00:23:18,692
Yeah? How'd you do?

211
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:21,111
I got lucky.

212
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:27,659
Welcome, neighbours!

213
00:23:27,742 --> 00:23:30,203
- Hi, Susan.
- Good to see you, John.

214
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:32,539
- There you go.
- Oh, this is wonderful.

215
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:35,417
Thank you.

216
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:39,421
- What a lovely dress.
- Thank you very much. So is yours.

217
00:23:40,422 --> 00:23:44,092
- Come on, let's go see the girls.
- Don't stray too far, guys.

218
00:23:44,175 --> 00:23:46,177
You want a Cuban?

219
00:23:46,261 --> 00:23:48,638
No, I don't smoke.

220
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:51,725
- Clean body, clean soul, Suzy says.
- Ain't that the truth.

221
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,311
- You guys have any vices?
- Well, you know.

222
00:23:54,394 --> 00:23:58,064
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yes. Chardonnay, please.

223
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,401
- Girls?
- Chardonnay.

224
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:06,197
- Daddy!
- I'll be up here at the filling station.

225
00:24:06,281 --> 00:24:08,825
<i>- ...stock's getting butchered.
- Hey, boys. Scotch?</i>

226
00:24:08,909 --> 00:24:11,286
- Yes, sir.
- It's a bloodbath over there.

227
00:24:11,369 --> 00:24:13,747
How'd you make out last quarter?
Take a beating?

228
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:18,001
Actually, I got all my dough
buried under the tool shed.

229
00:24:18,084 --> 00:24:22,631
- So, Chuck got the promotion.
- Oh, my God, that is so great.

230
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:25,759
So excited. We can finally
put the addition on the kitchen.

231
00:24:25,842 --> 00:24:28,553
Oh, shoot. Not again.

232
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:31,306
Shoulda worn a raincoat.

233
00:24:31,389 --> 00:24:34,809
You know what? Would...
Can you hold her for a second?

234
00:24:34,893 --> 00:24:37,395
- What? No...
- It's all over the appliqué.

235
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:40,023
- Oh, no, I...
- No, please, just...

236
00:24:40,106 --> 00:24:42,400
Sure.

237
00:24:44,152 --> 00:24:46,655
Seltzer.

238
00:24:48,907 --> 00:24:51,743
Aw, she likes you.

239
00:25:04,798 --> 00:25:07,926
I liked your dress tonight.

240
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,345
It was nice.

241
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:12,764
Thank you.

242
00:26:42,812 --> 00:26:46,316
Good morning, Mr Smith.
There's trouble in Atlanta again.

243
00:26:46,399 --> 00:26:50,946
- That's what I hear. What you got?
- I've got your boarding pass, taxi receipts...

244
00:26:51,029 --> 00:26:53,365
Get rid of that gum.

245
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:56,493
- You got a tissue?
- And your hotel bill.

246
00:26:56,576 --> 00:26:59,621
- Thanks.
- Don't lose those. Keep them in the envelope.

247
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:01,706
We've got the new specs for the dam.

248
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:04,292
- Great, Louie. I'll check those out.
- Here.

249
00:27:04,376 --> 00:27:08,338
- Is Eddie here?
- The door's unlocked.

250
00:27:08,421 --> 00:27:10,799
- Morning, pal.
- How you doing?

251
00:27:10,882 --> 00:27:13,677
Same old same old.
People need killing.

252
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,387
Oh, Johnny.

253
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,223
Little get-together this weekend at my house.

254
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:22,018
Barbecue, no ladies, dudes only.
It's gonna be awesome.

255
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:24,437
Yeah, I'll talk to the missus.

256
00:27:24,521 --> 00:27:27,232
You want to use my cellphone?
Maybe give her a call,

257
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:30,610
in case you decide to scratch your ass
or use the head later.

258
00:27:30,694 --> 00:27:34,614
- Make sure she thinks it's OK.
- You live with your mother.

259
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:37,659
Why bring her into this?
She's a first-class lady.

260
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:42,497
And I don't have to check in with her when I
want to do something. She cooks, she cleans.

261
00:27:42,581 --> 00:27:45,542
She makes me snacks.
I'm the dumb guy?

262
00:28:02,309 --> 00:28:04,311
John Smith.

263
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:11,276
- Hello, John.
- Morning, Atlanta.

264
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:16,656
Quite the body count this week. We have
a priority one, so I need your expertise.

265
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,536
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
aka "The Tank".

266
00:28:22,037 --> 00:28:26,124
He's a direct threat to the firm.
DIA custody.

267
00:28:26,207 --> 00:28:31,755
They're making a ground-to-air handoff
to heli, ten miles north of the Mexican border.

268
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:35,634
I need you to make sure
the target does not change hands.

269
00:28:35,717 --> 00:28:37,010
"The Tank"?

270
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:03,161
- I-Temp technology...
- Jane Smith confirmed.

271
00:29:03,245 --> 00:29:05,580
Stand by for contact.

272
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:08,083
Sorry to interrupt, but we have a situation.

273
00:29:08,166 --> 00:29:12,879
You know the competition would love to see
us burn. I need you to handle this personally.

274
00:29:12,963 --> 00:29:15,090
- Target?
- Benjamin Danz.

275
00:29:15,173 --> 00:29:19,761
I'm rolling the specs now.
We need this quick, clean, and contained.

276
00:29:19,844 --> 00:29:20,971
Yes, sir.

277
00:29:29,437 --> 00:29:31,273
- Ladies.
- Morning.

278
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:33,108
- Morning.
- Hello, Jane.

279
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:38,196
Yesterday's op: One kill,
one agent in protective custody.

280
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,824
- We'll get him out tomorrow.
- Two cases of G-40s.

281
00:29:40,907 --> 00:29:43,243
- The grenade launchers are here.
- Order more.

282
00:29:43,326 --> 00:29:45,537
All right. Go, Jas.

283
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:48,665
The target's name is Benjamin Danz,
aka "The Tank".

284
00:29:48,748 --> 00:29:50,709
- You serious?
- Yeah.

285
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,670
He's being moved across the border
to a federal facility.

286
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:57,716
The only point of vulnerability
is just south of the border.

287
00:29:57,799 --> 00:30:02,220
I want GPS and SAC of the canyon,
and the weather report for the last three days.

288
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:09,561
He'll rendezvous with the helicopter at a
deserted airstrip. We've one chance to strike.

289
00:30:12,355 --> 00:30:14,649
Oh, look. More desert.

290
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:50,769
- Are we green?
- Perimeter is armed. We are up and running.

291
00:31:04,324 --> 00:31:08,245
Red team, red team, this is Broadway Joe.
Half-time is approaching.

292
00:31:08,328 --> 00:31:10,664
Copy that, Broadway Joe.

293
00:31:46,199 --> 00:31:48,535
Oh, come on...

294
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:00,922
- You getting this?
- Affirmative. Is it a threat?

295
00:32:03,592 --> 00:32:06,761
Countdown's initiated.
The convoy is not in the zone yet.

296
00:32:06,845 --> 00:32:09,472
An idiot's in the field.
He'll blow the charges.

297
00:32:32,913 --> 00:32:34,956
OK.

298
00:32:42,756 --> 00:32:45,091
You gotta be kidding me.

299
00:32:48,386 --> 00:32:50,221
Civilians.

300
00:33:02,943 --> 00:33:05,445
Let's get a tune out of this trombone.

301
00:33:10,158 --> 00:33:12,244
Picking up a weapon signature.

302
00:33:12,327 --> 00:33:14,621
Shit. Not a civilian.

303
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:19,709
Aw, man...

304
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:20,794
Asshole.

305
00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:33,139
Countdown is initiated.

306
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,332
You should so not be allowed
to buy these things.

307
00:34:08,091 --> 00:34:09,342
Abort!

308
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:54,095
I think I got ID'd on that hit.
You ever been ID'd on a hit?

309
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:57,349
- Not that I'm aware of, no.
- Right. I'm in trouble.

310
00:34:57,432 --> 00:35:02,312
- You get a look at him?
- Little thing. Buck ten, buck fifteen tops.

311
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:05,065
Maybe he's Filipino.

312
00:35:05,148 --> 00:35:07,484
I'm not even sure it was a him.

313
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:12,239
You saying that you had
your ass handed to you by some girl?

314
00:35:12,322 --> 00:35:14,950
I think so. A pro.

315
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:21,164
Well, it shouldn't be that difficult. I mean,
how many chicks are hitters out there?

316
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:24,167
- You guys want any dessert?
- What do you have, honey?

317
00:35:24,251 --> 00:35:27,420
- Ice cream.
- Delicious. What flavours?

318
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:30,215
- Chocolate and vanilla.
- I don't like those.

319
00:35:30,298 --> 00:35:33,927
But mixed together,
that could be nice, you know what I mean?

320
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,764
And not just the little pink spoon,
I like the whole sundae.

321
00:35:37,847 --> 00:35:39,891
- That could be arranged.
- Perfect.

322
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:44,813
"Could be arranged." You hear that? I'd like
to have her kick my ass, know what I mean?

323
00:35:44,896 --> 00:35:48,608
- Any other details besides her weight class?
- Laptop.

324
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,860
Sorry? You're in a whole zone right now...

325
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:52,779
- Laptop.
- OK, laptop.

326
00:35:53,196 --> 00:35:55,991
I want to know who that bitch is.
Get me that tape.

327
00:35:56,074 --> 00:35:58,785
- Jane.
- Get me that tape.

328
00:35:58,868 --> 00:36:01,204
- What?
- It's Father.

329
00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:11,339
The FBI secured the package.
The window's closed, sir.

330
00:36:11,423 --> 00:36:15,010
- I told you we couldn't afford mistakes.
- There was another player.

331
00:36:15,093 --> 00:36:21,808
We do not leave witnesses.
If this player ID'd you... You know the rules.

332
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:24,853
You have 48 hours to clean the scene, Jane.

333
00:36:24,936 --> 00:36:27,272
Looking forward to it, sir.

334
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:34,195
All right, we have a new target.
Let's find out who he is.

335
00:36:36,281 --> 00:36:39,743
Jesus... What did you do to it?

336
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,787
Put a campfire out with it?

337
00:36:42,871 --> 00:36:45,081
Buy a new one.

338
00:36:45,165 --> 00:36:48,627
This one has sentimental value for its owner.

339
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:53,131
- Who's that?
- Well, Gwen, I'm just hoping you can tell me.

340
00:36:54,716 --> 00:36:58,303
So, why you gotta know so bad, anyway?

341
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:02,057
You know, just trying
to return some lost property.

342
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:05,060
- Hey, Phil.
- Hey, John.

343
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:08,521
- You a vegan?
- No.

344
00:37:08,605 --> 00:37:10,774
My girlfriend is.

345
00:37:12,442 --> 00:37:14,861
Here we go.

346
00:37:14,945 --> 00:37:18,031
Upgraded RAM module.

347
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,286
Chip's Chinese.

348
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:28,250
Imported by Dynamix. Retailed by...

349
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,756
You know, I might be able
to get you a billing address.

350
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,634
All right? No name, just an address.

351
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:42,222
<i>570 Lexington Avenue, Suite 5003.</i>

352
00:37:42,305 --> 00:37:44,391
New York.

353
00:37:44,474 --> 00:37:46,810
You know the place?

354
00:38:22,637 --> 00:38:25,056
Sweet Jesus! Mother of God...

355
00:38:43,283 --> 00:38:46,369
Why don't you both go make some coffee?

356
00:39:07,015 --> 00:39:09,726
Jane, it's your husband.

357
00:39:10,936 --> 00:39:15,941
He's back from Atlanta
and he wants to know about dinner.

358
00:39:16,024 --> 00:39:19,069
Tell him... Dinner's at seven.

359
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:23,490
Hi, John.
Yeah, she says dinner's at seven.

360
00:39:23,573 --> 00:39:25,909
It always is.

361
00:40:35,895 --> 00:40:38,023
Perfect timing.

362
00:40:38,106 --> 00:40:40,901
As always.

363
00:40:45,113 --> 00:40:48,074
- This is a nice surprise.
- I hope so.

364
00:40:48,158 --> 00:40:51,202
- You're home early.
- I missed you.

365
00:40:52,245 --> 00:40:54,664
I missed you, too.

366
00:40:54,748 --> 00:40:57,250
- Shall we?
- Yes.

367
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:16,311
- Thought these were for special occasions.
- This is a special occasion.

368
00:41:47,217 --> 00:41:50,011
Pot roast. My favourite.

369
00:41:54,099 --> 00:41:56,643
Allow me, sweetheart.

370
00:41:56,726 --> 00:41:59,020
Been on your feet all day.

371
00:41:59,104 --> 00:42:01,231
Thank you.

372
00:42:01,314 --> 00:42:03,650
Sure.

373
00:42:18,373 --> 00:42:21,251
So how's work?

374
00:42:23,378 --> 00:42:27,007
Actually, we had a little trouble
with a commission.

375
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,134
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

376
00:42:30,218 --> 00:42:33,680
Double booking with another firm.

377
00:42:33,763 --> 00:42:36,433
- Green beans?
- No, thank you.

378
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:38,852
You'll have some.

379
00:42:42,814 --> 00:42:44,983
Well, I hope everything worked out OK.

380
00:42:45,066 --> 00:42:47,110
It hasn't yet.

381
00:42:47,193 --> 00:42:50,071
But it will.

382
00:42:57,454 --> 00:42:59,915
Pot roast is my favourite.

383
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:02,918
Sweetheart, could you pass the salt?

384
00:43:39,746 --> 00:43:42,165
Tried something new?

385
00:43:59,224 --> 00:44:01,351
How was Atlanta?

386
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:07,065
Had a few problems ourselves.
Some figures didn't add up.

387
00:44:07,148 --> 00:44:09,943
- Big deal?
- Life or death. Wine?

388
00:44:34,134 --> 00:44:36,344
- I got it.
- I'll get a towel.

389
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,442
Janie?

390
00:44:53,987 --> 00:44:56,072
Honey?

391
00:45:04,039 --> 00:45:05,957
Jane!

392
00:45:12,547 --> 00:45:14,257
Jane!

393
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:19,554
How could I be so stupid?

394
00:45:30,649 --> 00:45:32,067
Jane!

395
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:34,152
Jane!

396
00:45:53,421 --> 00:45:55,924
Oh, dear God...

397
00:46:03,598 --> 00:46:06,184
Wait. No, no. Accident.

398
00:46:06,268 --> 00:46:08,520
Honey? Accident.

399
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:11,439
Jane, stop the car, now.

400
00:46:12,315 --> 00:46:14,526
Jane?

401
00:46:14,609 --> 00:46:16,611
You're overreacting.

402
00:46:17,821 --> 00:46:19,906
Let's not get carried away.

403
00:46:19,990 --> 00:46:22,742
We don't want to go to sleep angry.
We can talk this out.

404
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:24,035
God!

405
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:25,870
Pull over.

406
00:46:25,954 --> 00:46:28,582
Pull over! Pull over!

407
00:46:30,792 --> 00:46:32,752
Now, look...

408
00:46:37,716 --> 00:46:40,051
We need to talk!

409
00:46:50,562 --> 00:46:54,733
- OK, I'm coming. Who is it?
- Open up.

410
00:46:57,068 --> 00:47:00,155
- What the hell happened to you?
- My wife.

411
00:47:06,369 --> 00:47:08,955
- She tried to kill me.
- Yes. And you know what?

412
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:13,418
Gladys tried to kill me. Not with a car.
At least Jane was a man about it.

413
00:47:13,501 --> 00:47:18,965
But they all try to kill you. Slowly, painfully,
cripplingly. And then, wham! They hurt you.

414
00:47:19,049 --> 00:47:22,594
You know how hurt I used to be?
I used to beat myself up. Now I'm great.

415
00:47:22,677 --> 00:47:26,056
I got dates all the time.
I just woke up from a thing, I'm in my robe.

416
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:28,224
- You live with your mom.
- I choose to.

417
00:47:28,308 --> 00:47:32,228
Because that's the only woman
I've ever trusted.

418
00:47:34,397 --> 00:47:37,901
- It's unbelievable.
- Look, I know exactly what you're thinking.

419
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:41,029
If she lied about that,
what else has she lied about?

420
00:47:41,112 --> 00:47:44,324
I mean, herjob is a spy,
to get information from people.

421
00:47:44,407 --> 00:47:49,329
French Riviera. A yacht. An Iranian prince.

422
00:47:49,412 --> 00:47:53,959
She's supposed to get close to him
and gain his trust. It's disgusting.

423
00:47:54,042 --> 00:47:56,127
What? What are you saying?

424
00:47:56,211 --> 00:48:00,173
What? Your husband is the shooter?

425
00:48:00,257 --> 00:48:02,592
That's impossible.

426
00:48:03,969 --> 00:48:05,095
Really?

427
00:48:05,178 --> 00:48:09,266
This was probably planned from
the beginning. Operation Stakeout Johnny.

428
00:48:09,349 --> 00:48:14,187
A six-year stakeout to get information
from you. Mission accomplished.

429
00:48:16,731 --> 00:48:18,191
OK.

430
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:21,444
Here's the upside.

431
00:48:21,528 --> 00:48:23,530
- You don't love him.
- No.

432
00:48:23,613 --> 00:48:28,076
You'll kill him, and nobody's
better at that than you are.

433
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:31,621
- Thank you.
- And then it'll be over.

434
00:48:37,711 --> 00:48:41,548
Lookit, I know you're embarrassed,
but it's Eddie you're talking to.

435
00:48:41,631 --> 00:48:44,968
The guys we work with,
they don't know, I'm never gonna tell 'em.

436
00:48:45,051 --> 00:48:49,931
The people she works with probably got
a big laugh over this, but that's not important.

437
00:48:50,015 --> 00:48:53,768
<i>Lookit, it's like 150 pages
of a book have been written.</i>

438
00:48:53,852 --> 00:48:57,606
<i>In the first 150 pages, Johnny's been a clown.</i>

439
00:48:57,689 --> 00:49:04,446
Well, you can write the last ten pages. You
been smoked, but you can write the last ten.

440
00:49:04,529 --> 00:49:08,450
Great talk, man. We should do it more often.
It was great, I'm proud of you.

441
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:11,745
- I'm gonna borrow this.
- I like where your head's at, man.

442
00:49:11,828 --> 00:49:13,830
- I'll do it in the morning.
- Yeah.

443
00:49:15,373 --> 00:49:16,708
- You OK?
- Yeah.

444
00:49:16,791 --> 00:49:19,502
- OK. Good night.
- Night.

445
00:49:34,893 --> 00:49:36,853
You don't love him.

446
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:39,898
- Night, Johnny.
- Night, Eddie.

447
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:42,317
Good night, Mom.

448
00:50:30,282 --> 00:50:31,950
OK, girls. Let's go.

449
00:50:32,033 --> 00:50:35,745
Pocket litter, receipts, matchbooks.
You know the drill.

450
00:50:54,848 --> 00:50:58,184
This is nice. Who picked this out?

451
00:51:00,770 --> 00:51:03,398
- What is this?
- It looks like your wedding.

452
00:51:03,481 --> 00:51:06,985
- I know what it is. What are you doing?
- Research on the target.

453
00:51:07,068 --> 00:51:09,446
This room is wrapped. Thank you.

454
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:16,745
<i>...to have and to hold,
to love and to cherish, till death do us part.</i>

455
00:51:16,828 --> 00:51:19,414
I promise.

456
00:51:19,497 --> 00:51:24,753
I, John, take you, Jane, to be my lawfully
wedded wife, to have and to h...

457
00:51:32,469 --> 00:51:34,804
What's going on, Mrs Smith?

458
00:51:35,764 --> 00:51:37,223
Garden party, girls.

459
00:51:46,191 --> 00:51:49,069
Howdy, neighbour.

460
00:51:55,450 --> 00:51:59,996
Wow. I can't believe I've never
been in here before. This is great.

461
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:03,500
- Start with the living room.
- Oh, yeah.

462
00:52:03,583 --> 00:52:08,755
- I love the floors. What are they, teak?
- Red oak, Martin. Red oak.

463
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:14,552
And you won the Golf Masters trophy
this year.

464
00:52:14,636 --> 00:52:18,139
- Again.
- Again. That'll be on your mantel next year.

465
00:52:49,629 --> 00:52:50,922
Bitch.

466
00:52:55,885 --> 00:52:58,471
Target profile is our main priority.

467
00:52:59,472 --> 00:53:01,516
Utilise all means necessary.

468
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:05,729
Phone taps. Credit cards.
Audio scan civilian frequencies.

469
00:53:05,812 --> 00:53:08,148
With what, Jane?

470
00:53:10,275 --> 00:53:13,445
You've reached the Smiths.
We can't take your call,

471
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:16,948
but leave a message after the tone
and we'll get back to you.

472
00:53:17,032 --> 00:53:21,328
- And search the database.
- For what? John Smith?

473
00:53:24,164 --> 00:53:27,751
- Find him.
- Jane?

474
00:53:27,834 --> 00:53:29,419
What?

475
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:32,047
- I think I found him.
- Where?

476
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:34,466
Here.

477
00:53:36,468 --> 00:53:39,095
Heat sensor breach in the perimeter.

478
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:42,641
Commence scanning all floors.

479
00:53:45,477 --> 00:53:48,104
I told you not to bother me
at the office, honey.

480
00:53:48,188 --> 00:53:54,069
- Well, you are still Mrs Smith.
- Well, so are a lot of girls.

481
00:53:54,152 --> 00:53:56,821
Careful. I can push the button
any time, anywhere.

482
00:53:56,905 --> 00:54:00,408
Baby, you couldn't find the button
with both hands and a map.

483
00:54:02,619 --> 00:54:05,580
Last warning. You need to disappear.

484
00:54:05,664 --> 00:54:06,873
- No.
- Now.

485
00:54:06,957 --> 00:54:08,458
D sector clear.

486
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:12,837
- You expect me to roll over and play dead?
- Should be used to it after five years.

487
00:54:12,921 --> 00:54:17,384
- Six. And I'm not leaving.
- E sector clear.

488
00:54:19,678 --> 00:54:21,554
Anywhere, any time.

489
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:24,391
Intruder detected.

490
00:54:24,474 --> 00:54:28,812
- Evacuate plan C.
- Evacuation in progress.

491
00:54:30,855 --> 00:54:33,650
Evacuation in progress.

492
00:54:35,443 --> 00:54:37,571
Evacuation in progress.

493
00:54:51,835 --> 00:54:54,129
Evacuation in progress.

494
00:55:49,267 --> 00:55:51,019
Chickenshit!

495
00:55:52,270 --> 00:55:53,897
Pussy!

496
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:03,031
You tell me you had a shot at her
and you didn't take it?

497
00:56:03,365 --> 00:56:08,078
We got all this stuff here, and you're trying
to tell me you couldn't take her out?

498
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:13,500
Well, now she's a problem for both of us.
Now my house is priority one.

499
00:56:13,959 --> 00:56:15,961
Just gimme a hand, will you?

500
00:56:16,044 --> 00:56:20,257
You're driving me crazy with the tongs
and the furnace. You're like an insane man.

501
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:24,052
All right, they gave you 48 hours.
What we got left here?

502
00:56:24,135 --> 00:56:27,639
- 23? 22?
- 18 and change.

503
00:56:27,722 --> 00:56:31,017
- 18 hours until they close the book on you?
- Eddie?

504
00:56:31,101 --> 00:56:35,814
Mom, we're on high alert here!
I almost killed you right then.

505
00:56:35,897 --> 00:56:40,068
- You do not even realise!
- Never mind.

506
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:43,363
I am so done playing games with this broad.

507
00:56:43,446 --> 00:56:46,950
- You gotta take her out head-on.
- Don't tell me how to handle my wife.

508
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:50,412
She's not your wife, she's the enemy.
She could be outside now!

509
00:56:50,495 --> 00:56:52,372
Eddie.

510
00:56:52,455 --> 00:56:54,708
Got it.

511
00:56:55,584 --> 00:56:59,129
Now we're talking. Only question is,
how much is it to buy a vowel?

512
00:57:05,343 --> 00:57:08,305
- Blackbow Realty.
- Hi, I'm from I-Temp.

513
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:10,890
Great!
How's our new penthouse working out?

514
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:14,019
Well, just fine, thank you for asking.

515
00:57:41,588 --> 00:57:44,966
This is security.
There's a problem with your elevator, sir.

516
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:47,969
Do you want an engineer
to come see what the problem is?

517
00:57:48,053 --> 00:57:51,014
Take your time, I'm really quite comfortable.

518
00:57:51,097 --> 00:57:53,975
Are you really comfortable?

519
00:57:54,059 --> 00:57:55,894
Jane?

520
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:59,564
Is that you, sweetheart?

521
00:57:59,648 --> 00:58:02,734
First and last warning, John.
Get out of town.

522
00:58:03,568 --> 00:58:05,904
You know I'm not going anywhere.

523
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:09,699
Well, so you say. But right now,
you're trapped in a steel box

524
00:58:09,783 --> 00:58:12,285
hanging 70 floors over nothing but air.

525
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:15,956
- Oh, so this is a trap?
- He's in car three.

526
00:58:16,039 --> 00:58:18,250
It's never gonna work, honey.

527
00:58:18,333 --> 00:58:23,088
It's never gonna work,
because you constantly underestimate me.

528
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:26,216
- Do I?
- You have no idea who I am.

529
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:29,135
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

530
00:58:30,136 --> 00:58:33,348
- Well, back at you, baby.
- Let me guess...

531
00:58:34,099 --> 00:58:39,396
Shaped charge on the counterbalance cable,
two on the primary and secondary brakes?

532
00:58:39,479 --> 00:58:40,981
Maybe?

533
00:58:41,064 --> 00:58:43,650
- He found them.
- Yes, thank you.

534
00:58:43,733 --> 00:58:48,154
Did you also get the base charge
on the principle cable?

535
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:52,284
Promise to leave town, or I'll blow it.

536
00:58:57,831 --> 00:59:00,667
OK. I give up.

537
00:59:01,918 --> 00:59:04,713
Blow it.

538
00:59:04,796 --> 00:59:08,300
- What?
- Go on, blow it.

539
00:59:08,383 --> 00:59:12,470
- You think I won't?
- I think you won't.

540
00:59:13,555 --> 00:59:15,974
OK.

541
00:59:16,057 --> 00:59:18,643
Five, four...

542
00:59:19,102 --> 00:59:22,480
- Any last words?
- The new curtains are hideous.

543
00:59:22,564 --> 00:59:23,648
Goodbye, John.

544
00:59:35,201 --> 00:59:40,040
- What the hell was that?
- What? You said goodbye.

545
00:59:51,134 --> 00:59:53,553
The gas! Cut off the gas!

546
01:00:16,868 --> 01:00:18,870
Jane?

547
01:01:29,065 --> 01:01:31,943
Madame.

548
01:01:32,027 --> 01:01:35,405
Thought of a number of lines
for this moment.

549
01:01:35,488 --> 01:01:40,410
"Thought I'd just drop in."
"Hey, doll, thanks for giving me the shaft."

550
01:01:40,493 --> 01:01:44,164
Nice. So what did you decide?

551
01:01:44,915 --> 01:01:47,167
I want a divorce.

552
01:01:47,626 --> 01:01:51,546
I like it. You proposed to me here,
so it has agreeable symmetry.

553
01:01:51,630 --> 01:01:53,965
Coat, sir?

554
01:01:55,258 --> 01:01:57,594
- May I sit?
- No.

555
01:02:12,984 --> 01:02:15,987
- Champagne?
- No, champagne's for celebrating.

556
01:02:16,071 --> 01:02:19,241
- I'll have a martini.
- I'm fine, thank you.

557
01:02:23,286 --> 01:02:26,414
So what do you want, John?

558
01:02:26,498 --> 01:02:29,167
We have an unusual problem, Jane.

559
01:02:30,168 --> 01:02:35,048
You obviously want me dead. And I'm
less and less concerned of your wellbeing.

560
01:02:35,131 --> 01:02:37,384
So what do we do?

561
01:02:38,551 --> 01:02:42,097
Do we shoot it out here? Hope for the best?

562
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:48,562
Well, that would be a shame, because they'd
probably ask me to leave once you're dead.

563
01:02:51,773 --> 01:02:54,109
Dance with me.

564
01:02:55,944 --> 01:02:59,573
- You don't dance.
- That was just part of my cover, sweetheart.

565
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:02,075
Was sloth part of it too?

566
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,960
Think this'll have a happy ending?

567
01:03:12,043 --> 01:03:16,798
Happy endings are just
stories that haven't finished yet.

568
01:03:37,319 --> 01:03:39,404
Satisfied?

569
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:41,948
Not for years.

570
01:03:48,788 --> 01:03:51,124
It's all John, sweetheart.

571
01:04:09,142 --> 01:04:12,771
Why is it you think we failed?
Cos we were leading separate lives?

572
01:04:12,854 --> 01:04:15,065
Or was it all the lying that did us in?

573
01:04:15,148 --> 01:04:18,276
I have a theory. Newly formed.

574
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,279
- I'm breathless to hear it.
- You killed us.

575
01:04:21,363 --> 01:04:23,698
Provocative.

576
01:04:24,532 --> 01:04:29,329
You approached our marriage like ajob,
to be reconned, planned and executed.

577
01:04:29,412 --> 01:04:31,623
And you avoided it.

578
01:04:31,706 --> 01:04:34,292
What do you care, if I was just a cover?

579
01:04:34,376 --> 01:04:37,587
Well, who said you were just a cover?

580
01:04:37,671 --> 01:04:40,507
- Wasn't I?
- Wasn't I?

581
01:04:47,514 --> 01:04:49,891
I have to... Excuse me.

582
01:04:50,684 --> 01:04:53,019
No exits up there, Jane.

583
01:04:57,023 --> 01:04:59,943
Be cold, John. She's a liar.

584
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:07,075
Be super cold.

585
01:05:19,754 --> 01:05:22,090
Come on, madam, this way.

586
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:41,067
Do you know that you're ticking?

587
01:05:45,697 --> 01:05:48,158
Get back!

588
01:05:53,288 --> 01:05:55,498
Limo, sir?

589
01:06:11,306 --> 01:06:12,432
Jane Smith.

590
01:06:12,891 --> 01:06:16,603
- That's the second time you tried to kill me.
- It was just a little bomb.

591
01:06:16,686 --> 01:06:19,773
I'm going home to burn
everything I ever bought you.

592
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:22,567
I'll race you there, baby.

593
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:39,960
You there yet?

594
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:43,463
First time we met,
what was your first thought?

595
01:06:44,047 --> 01:06:46,007
You tell me.

596
01:06:46,091 --> 01:06:48,385
I thought...

597
01:06:51,346 --> 01:06:54,474
I thought you looked like Christmas morning.

598
01:06:55,475 --> 01:06:58,270
I don't know how else to say it.

599
01:06:58,353 --> 01:07:00,981
And why are you telling me this now?

600
01:07:01,898 --> 01:07:06,403
Guess in the end
you start thinking about the beginning.

601
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:11,491
So there it is.
I thought you should know.

602
01:07:13,410 --> 01:07:16,288
So how about it, Jane? Hm?

603
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:19,874
I thought...

604
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:30,719
I thought that you were
the most beautiful mark I'd ever seen.

605
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:36,600
- So it was all business, yeah?
- All business.

606
01:07:36,683 --> 01:07:39,019
- From the go.
- Cold, hard math.

607
01:07:40,604 --> 01:07:43,815
Thank you.
That's what I needed to know.

608
01:07:46,151 --> 01:07:48,320
OK.

609
01:08:39,246 --> 01:08:41,248
Hey, John.

610
01:08:41,331 --> 01:08:42,540
Hey, Bill.

611
01:08:43,166 --> 01:08:45,710
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

612
01:08:45,794 --> 01:08:47,796
OK.

613
01:08:49,339 --> 01:08:54,427
Uh, by the way, John, your car
is hanging out over the sidewalk here.

614
01:08:54,511 --> 01:08:57,138
- Yeah, thanks, Bill.
- OK. Have a good night.

615
01:08:57,222 --> 01:08:59,099
Good night.

616
01:09:00,225 --> 01:09:02,227
Shit.

617
01:09:50,275 --> 01:09:52,611
Shit.

618
01:11:38,758 --> 01:11:40,635
You still alive, baby?

619
01:12:56,002 --> 01:12:59,714
Your aim's as bad as your cooking,
sweetheart.

620
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:04,010
And that's saying something.

621
01:13:38,253 --> 01:13:40,839
Come on, honey.

622
01:13:40,922 --> 01:13:43,675
Come to Daddy.

623
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:53,393
Who's your daddy now?

624
01:15:23,275 --> 01:15:25,610
Can't do it.

625
01:15:28,238 --> 01:15:31,241
Don't! Come on.

626
01:15:31,324 --> 01:15:34,035
Come on!

627
01:15:35,078 --> 01:15:37,330
You want it?

628
01:15:37,414 --> 01:15:39,457
It's yours.

629
01:16:52,948 --> 01:16:55,867
Hi, stranger.

630
01:16:55,951 --> 01:16:58,286
Hiya back.

631
01:17:08,213 --> 01:17:12,092
- Yeah?
- Everything OK? We heard an awful ruckus.

632
01:17:12,175 --> 01:17:16,972
- No, everything's fine here. Yeah, it's great.
- So you guys are fine?

633
01:17:17,055 --> 01:17:19,349
Yeah, couldn't be better.

634
01:17:21,685 --> 01:17:23,687
Nice. You guys are...

635
01:17:23,770 --> 01:17:25,814
- Suzy, Martin.
- Have a nice night.

636
01:17:25,897 --> 01:17:30,402
Looks like you're redecorating, it's very...
Yeah. Shame about the red oak...

637
01:17:36,783 --> 01:17:39,160
Five more minutes, Mom...

638
01:17:51,256 --> 01:17:55,510
Tempting. But I don't get out of bed
for less than half a million dollars.

639
01:18:59,282 --> 01:19:02,410
- That left of yours... A thing of beauty.
- You take it well.

640
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:04,746
Thank you.

641
01:19:07,249 --> 01:19:09,584
That vacation in Aspen?

642
01:19:10,794 --> 01:19:13,171
You left early. Why?

643
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:17,050
- Jean-Luc Gaspard.
- Oh, God!

644
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:19,302
- Yeah.
- I wanted him.

645
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:21,805
Forget it.

646
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:27,394
You didn't hear me that night the chopper
dropped me off for our anniversary dinner.

647
01:19:27,477 --> 01:19:30,063
- No.
- No?

648
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:34,901
Percussion grenades.
I was partially deaf that night.

649
01:19:40,407 --> 01:19:42,659
I'm slightly colour blind.

650
01:19:42,742 --> 01:19:47,581
- Retinal scarring.
- I can't feel anything in these three fingers.

651
01:19:57,215 --> 01:20:02,470
Three ribs. Broken eye socket.
Perforated eardrum.

652
01:20:06,433 --> 01:20:09,686
You ever have trouble sleeping after?

653
01:20:11,104 --> 01:20:13,440
- Nope.
- Yeah, me neither.

654
01:20:46,264 --> 01:20:49,184
Go, go, go.
Look out.

655
01:20:50,936 --> 01:20:52,729
Move it.

656
01:20:53,480 --> 01:20:56,107
Shoes.

657
01:20:59,402 --> 01:21:01,780
I was given 48 hours to take you out.

658
01:21:01,863 --> 01:21:03,448
Same.

659
01:21:03,531 --> 01:21:05,951
Jesus, where's the trust?

660
01:21:06,034 --> 01:21:08,370
What do you expect?

661
01:21:13,416 --> 01:21:16,169
Why do I get the girl gun?

662
01:21:18,964 --> 01:21:21,591
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

663
01:22:55,143 --> 01:22:57,479
We need a car.

664
01:23:02,025 --> 01:23:03,526
Colemans.

665
01:23:06,738 --> 01:23:09,491
Guy's had my barbecue set for months.

666
01:23:10,492 --> 01:23:14,079
- I was never in the Peace Corps.
- What?

667
01:23:14,162 --> 01:23:16,206
I really liked that about you.

668
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:20,085
Maybe this honesty thing
isn't such a good idea.

669
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:22,587
- I didn't go to MIT.
- Really?

670
01:23:22,671 --> 01:23:25,840
Notre Dame. Art History major.

671
01:23:27,092 --> 01:23:29,719
- Art?
- History.

672
01:23:29,803 --> 01:23:32,347
- It's reputable.
- OK.

673
01:23:52,659 --> 01:23:55,245
Fuckers get younger every year.

674
01:24:01,001 --> 01:24:05,046
I have to tell you,
I never really liked your cooking.

675
01:24:06,047 --> 01:24:08,133
It's not your gift.

676
01:24:08,216 --> 01:24:11,386
Baby, I've never cooked a day in my life.

677
01:24:12,554 --> 01:24:14,931
I-Temp girls cooked.

678
01:24:16,933 --> 01:24:19,352
Web of lies!

679
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:24,274
I don't know how you do it

680
01:24:24,357 --> 01:24:27,068
Making love

681
01:24:27,152 --> 01:24:28,778
Out of nothing at all

682
01:24:28,862 --> 01:24:30,864
Making love...

683
01:24:31,990 --> 01:24:33,658
I like it. Deal with it.

684
01:24:38,288 --> 01:24:40,707
- We got company.
- What?

685
01:24:42,375 --> 01:24:44,753
Shit.

686
01:24:54,304 --> 01:24:59,976
- Baby, hold steady now!
- It's called evasive driving, sweetheart.

687
01:25:02,020 --> 01:25:04,064
Hold still.

688
01:25:10,487 --> 01:25:13,823
This thing's all over the place.
How do you drive these things?

689
01:25:13,907 --> 01:25:14,950
Honey!

690
01:25:21,831 --> 01:25:24,000
- Honey, let me drive.
- I got it.

691
01:25:24,084 --> 01:25:27,420
Move over. Move.

692
01:25:27,504 --> 01:25:29,923
I'm the suburban housewife, sweetheart.

693
01:25:30,006 --> 01:25:32,300
- You move.
- Fine. Go.

694
01:25:34,511 --> 01:25:36,680
- Go.
- Go.

695
01:25:46,523 --> 01:25:48,900
They're bulletproof.

696
01:25:48,984 --> 01:25:51,319
They're bulletproof!

697
01:26:00,370 --> 01:26:03,331
I think I should probably tell you.

698
01:26:03,415 --> 01:26:06,710
I was married once before.

699
01:26:12,841 --> 01:26:16,052
- What is wrong with you?
- You're what's wrong with me.

700
01:26:16,136 --> 01:26:20,056
- It was a drunken Vegas thing.
- That's better. That's much better. Great.

701
01:26:20,140 --> 01:26:22,142
Stop it.

702
01:26:29,774 --> 01:26:30,984
Go, go, go!

703
01:26:39,367 --> 01:26:43,705
- Her name and social security number?
- No, you're not gonna kill her.

704
01:27:11,733 --> 01:27:14,194
These doors are handy.

705
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:23,662
You know, sweetheart,
you're being a bit hypocritical.

706
01:27:23,745 --> 01:27:27,123
It's not like you're some beacon of truth.

707
01:27:29,626 --> 01:27:31,962
John, my parents...

708
01:27:33,129 --> 01:27:35,799
They died when I was five.
I'm an orphan.

709
01:27:35,882 --> 01:27:39,094
Who was that kindly fellow
who gave you away at our wedding?

710
01:27:39,177 --> 01:27:41,429
Paid actor.

711
01:27:43,139 --> 01:27:45,934
<i>I said I saw your dad on Fantasy Island.</i>

712
01:27:46,017 --> 01:27:47,894
I know.

713
01:27:47,978 --> 01:27:49,980
I don't even want to talk about it.

714
01:28:05,579 --> 01:28:07,747
- You got it?
- Got it.

715
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,750
- Any time.
- I got it.

716
01:28:52,918 --> 01:28:58,006
We're gonna have to redo
every conversation we've ever had.

717
01:28:58,089 --> 01:28:59,716
I'm Jewish.

718
01:29:02,260 --> 01:29:05,096
Can't believe I brought
my real parents to our wedding.

719
01:29:05,388 --> 01:29:07,515
Disgusting.
How could you serve this?

720
01:29:07,599 --> 01:29:13,521
Ma'am, is it possible to get this reheated?
Miss? Miss, I'm talking to you. Excuse me?

721
01:29:14,564 --> 01:29:16,566
Jesus, Johnny.

722
01:29:16,650 --> 01:29:19,277
- Good morning, Eddie.
- Morning.

723
01:29:19,361 --> 01:29:21,696
It's good to see you're OK.

724
01:29:23,156 --> 01:29:26,409
Tell me you got smart
and that you killed that lying bitch.

725
01:29:26,493 --> 01:29:29,079
This lying bitch?

726
01:29:29,162 --> 01:29:31,706
Guess it was just wishful thinking.

727
01:29:31,790 --> 01:29:32,999
- I'm sorry.
- Eddie.

728
01:29:33,083 --> 01:29:37,254
- Nice to see you, Jane.
- Eddie. Eddie! Focus. We got problems.

729
01:29:37,337 --> 01:29:41,466
Problems? Crack addicts got problems,
my friend. You two are smoked.

730
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,842
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

731
01:29:42,926 --> 01:29:47,097
You got the entire agency gunning for you.
Probably her agency, too.

732
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:51,059
- And what about you? Where you at?
- Me? Where am I at?

733
01:29:52,018 --> 01:29:55,730
I find myself dragging my feet this morning.

734
01:29:55,814 --> 01:29:58,692
I think you owe me a little money, anyway.

735
01:30:02,070 --> 01:30:04,573
- So what do...
- We don't understand each other.

736
01:30:04,656 --> 01:30:07,826
But I don't need those looks, OK?
I been in his life a long time.

737
01:30:07,909 --> 01:30:10,245
- Focus, Eddie, focus.
- A long time.

738
01:30:10,328 --> 01:30:15,625
I'm pissed off. They blew up my house,
they shot at my wife. My own company.

739
01:30:15,709 --> 01:30:19,212
If she works for
who the street says that she works for...

740
01:30:21,006 --> 01:30:26,261
<i>...you're Macy's and Gimbel's. Then she would
be the WE channel, and you would be...</i>

741
01:30:26,344 --> 01:30:30,348
Whatever channel competes against
the WE channel. Know what I'm saying?

742
01:30:30,432 --> 01:30:34,311
The point is simple. Once you guys
get off the reservation, that's it.

743
01:30:34,394 --> 01:30:37,355
- Then you're off the reservation.
- Eddie, how bad?

744
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:39,941
How bad is it?

745
01:30:40,025 --> 01:30:42,277
You remember Canada.

746
01:30:42,694 --> 01:30:45,030
- Kids' stuff next to this.
- That was you?

747
01:30:45,113 --> 01:30:48,241
Is that a turn-on?
Didn't she try to kill you with a car?

748
01:30:48,325 --> 01:30:51,369
A good friend stays out of it.
This is the facts.

749
01:30:51,453 --> 01:30:57,083
If you two separate from each other, you got
a shot. Not a great shot, Johnny, but a shot.

750
01:30:57,167 --> 01:31:00,962
You two stay together, you're dead.

751
01:31:01,046 --> 01:31:05,717
Unless you can find something they want
more than they want you.

752
01:31:10,138 --> 01:31:14,309
Found him. He's being held
in sub-basement D of the federal courthouse.

753
01:31:14,392 --> 01:31:19,606
High security, motion and thermal.
Power's on the city grid.

754
01:31:20,398 --> 01:31:23,485
This is as far as we go, Jane.

755
01:31:23,568 --> 01:31:27,489
- Right. Thanks for everything.
- Good luck, baby.

756
01:31:30,408 --> 01:31:36,039
<i>...and this north-westerly blow coming
down from the middle of the country...</i>

757
01:31:36,122 --> 01:31:38,458
Do you guys mind changing the channel?

758
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:40,669
<i>...one is moving in now...</i>

759
01:31:40,752 --> 01:31:46,216
Nick? Would you please get off
your fat ass and change the channel?

760
01:31:46,299 --> 01:31:52,722
<i>- I know it's tough. Thank you.
- ...tomorrow, that's going to make things...</i>

761
01:32:18,582 --> 01:32:23,169
30 second window. I cut the power,
you grab the kid. Simple and clean. Got it?

762
01:32:23,253 --> 01:32:25,630
Got it.

763
01:32:25,714 --> 01:32:28,300
Tell me, how many?

764
01:32:30,010 --> 01:32:32,178
Does it matter?

765
01:32:32,262 --> 01:32:34,931
- Should I go first?
- OK.

766
01:32:35,432 --> 01:32:38,101
I don't exactly keep count, but...

767
01:32:39,060 --> 01:32:41,229
I would say...

768
01:32:41,313 --> 01:32:43,648
<i>High 50s, low 60s.</i>

769
01:32:45,692 --> 01:32:48,987
I've been around the block,
but the important thing is...

770
01:32:49,070 --> 01:32:51,239
312.

771
01:32:52,574 --> 01:32:54,910
312?

772
01:32:56,745 --> 01:32:59,289
- How?
- Some were two at a time.

773
01:33:05,879 --> 01:33:08,632
- Honey?
- I'm...

774
01:33:15,096 --> 01:33:18,600
- You monitoring the perimeter?
- I checked the perimeter.

775
01:33:18,683 --> 01:33:21,603
- What about the police bands?
- I'm on the police bands.

776
01:33:21,686 --> 01:33:23,855
- Connected...
- This is not my first time.

777
01:33:25,148 --> 01:33:27,943
Think we've established that.

778
01:33:31,238 --> 01:33:32,280
All right.

779
01:33:34,324 --> 01:33:36,618
Turn left.

780
01:33:36,701 --> 01:33:38,453
Left, John.

781
01:33:39,162 --> 01:33:40,747
Left.

782
01:33:41,289 --> 01:33:45,335
You don't need to talk to me like that.
OK? Be nice.

783
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:48,380
- Left, please.
- I can't go left.

784
01:33:48,463 --> 01:33:51,967
See? There is no left. Look.

785
01:33:52,050 --> 01:33:54,511
I have straight, or back the way I came.

786
01:33:54,594 --> 01:33:56,805
There's no left.
Which way do you want?

787
01:33:56,888 --> 01:34:00,225
- Just stay there and wait for my mark.
- See what I'm sitting in?

788
01:34:00,308 --> 01:34:02,310
You see that?

789
01:34:03,311 --> 01:34:05,647
- Take your time.
- Yeah, all right! Stay.

790
01:34:05,730 --> 01:34:08,525
Stay there, wait for my mark. I'll find it.

791
01:34:10,318 --> 01:34:12,487
Wait for my mark.

792
01:34:16,825 --> 01:34:21,246
Almost there.
I don't know what happened. Just hold on.

793
01:34:28,253 --> 01:34:32,716
John, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

794
01:34:32,799 --> 01:34:35,552
Cut the lights on my signal.

795
01:34:36,511 --> 01:34:38,972
Now. Kill the lights.

796
01:34:40,348 --> 01:34:42,767
- Jane, kill the lights.
- What's that?

797
01:34:42,851 --> 01:34:47,689
- Where?
- Turn 'em back on! Idiot!

798
01:34:49,190 --> 01:34:51,359
- Here they come.
- Uncuff me.

799
01:34:51,985 --> 01:34:55,864
Turn 'em back on.
Turn 'em back on!

800
01:34:57,324 --> 01:34:59,534
- Turn 'em back on!
- All right!

801
01:35:00,285 --> 01:35:03,246
- Give me the light!
- Shut up!

802
01:35:06,124 --> 01:35:08,335
- Nick!
- Shut up.

803
01:35:12,339 --> 01:35:15,550
Give me a gun.
Nick, give me a gun!

804
01:35:15,634 --> 01:35:17,636
Zip it!

805
01:35:35,654 --> 01:35:38,031
This guy's a wily one.

806
01:35:48,541 --> 01:35:51,753
- You didn't wait for my signal.
- I improvised.

807
01:35:51,836 --> 01:35:54,256
- You deviated from the plan.
- Plan was flawed.

808
01:35:54,339 --> 01:35:57,926
- The plan was not flawed.
- Anal.

809
01:35:58,009 --> 01:36:00,887
- Organised.
- Jane, 90 per cent of this job is instinct.

810
01:36:00,971 --> 01:36:05,225
- Your instincts set off the alarms.
- And got the job done. Not The Jane Show...

811
01:36:05,308 --> 01:36:09,396
No, it was The John Show. Half-assed.
Like Christmas, our anniversary,

812
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:12,440
the time you forgot to bring
my mother's birthday present.

813
01:36:12,524 --> 01:36:17,195
- Your fake mother's birthday.
- You are always the first to break team.

814
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:20,198
You don't want a team,
you want a servant for hire.

815
01:36:20,282 --> 01:36:23,118
I want someone I can count on.

816
01:36:23,201 --> 01:36:27,956
- Jane, there's no air around you any more.
- OK, what is that supposed to mean?

817
01:36:28,039 --> 01:36:32,711
It means there's no room for mistakes,
no mistakes whatsoever. No spontaneity.

818
01:36:32,794 --> 01:36:35,338
- Who can answer to that?
- Well, you don't have to.

819
01:36:35,422 --> 01:36:38,258
Cos this isn't even a real marriage.

820
01:36:39,259 --> 01:36:42,262
- Who are you people?
- Shut up!

821
01:36:48,184 --> 01:36:50,395
OK. So, now I realise

822
01:36:50,478 --> 01:36:54,608
you witnessed the missus and I
working through some domestic issues.

823
01:36:54,691 --> 01:36:57,027
That's regrettable.

824
01:36:58,278 --> 01:37:01,907
But don't take that as a sign of weakness.
That would be a mistake.

825
01:37:01,990 --> 01:37:04,576
Now, tell us what you know.

826
01:37:04,659 --> 01:37:07,621
Why do both our bosses want you dead?

827
01:37:09,372 --> 01:37:12,334
You underst... Honey.

828
01:37:12,417 --> 01:37:14,586
Please?

829
01:37:15,629 --> 01:37:16,838
Wrap it up.

830
01:37:16,922 --> 01:37:20,800
Maybe it's not a good idea
to undermine me in front of the hostage.

831
01:37:20,884 --> 01:37:23,178
Sends a mixed message.

832
01:37:23,929 --> 01:37:25,639
Sorry.

833
01:37:25,722 --> 01:37:27,807
Girls.

834
01:37:29,142 --> 01:37:31,895
OK. Where was I?

835
01:37:31,978 --> 01:37:34,481
- A mistake on your part.
- Shut up. Options.

836
01:37:34,564 --> 01:37:37,567
I'm gonna lay out your options for you, OK?
Option A...

837
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:40,028
- If I could...
- Shut up.

838
01:37:40,111 --> 01:37:43,907
Option A. You talk, we listen, no pain.

839
01:37:43,990 --> 01:37:46,451
Option B. You don't talk.

840
01:37:46,534 --> 01:37:50,163
I remove your thumbs with my pliers.
It will hurt.

841
01:37:50,997 --> 01:37:53,166
Option C.

842
01:37:53,250 --> 01:37:57,420
I like to vary the details a bit,
but the punch line is, you die.

843
01:38:00,507 --> 01:38:04,469
Benjamin?
We're impatient people, Benjamin.

844
01:38:10,600 --> 01:38:14,187
Can I get a soda? Or ajuice, or some...

845
01:38:15,021 --> 01:38:17,732
A, option A!

846
01:38:17,816 --> 01:38:21,236
- Ow, that hurt!
- OK, that was a nice shot.

847
01:38:26,533 --> 01:38:28,535
What's... You got a spasm?

848
01:38:28,618 --> 01:38:32,372
I'm tied up.
Why don't you check my back pocket?

849
01:38:40,964 --> 01:38:44,092
I'm not the target.
You are. Both of you.

850
01:38:45,093 --> 01:38:50,015
They found out you're married, so they
teamed up and sent you to the same hit.

851
01:38:50,098 --> 01:38:52,267
It was ajoint task force, both companies.

852
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:56,479
Two competing agents living under
the same roof? It's bad for business.

853
01:38:56,563 --> 01:39:01,192
- They wanted you to take each other out.
- You were bait.

854
01:39:01,276 --> 01:39:04,279
Well, it's entry level.
Toehold into the company.

855
01:39:04,362 --> 01:39:08,074
Couple hits, they bump me up to a desk.
It's pretty cool, actually.

856
01:39:08,158 --> 01:39:11,411
- You keep the photo in your pocket?
- Was I supposed to frame it?

857
01:39:11,494 --> 01:39:14,581
You get rid of it. You burn it.
Tradecraft 101.

858
01:39:14,664 --> 01:39:19,878
Guess I skipped that day. I guess you skipped
the day about not marrying the enemy.

859
01:39:19,961 --> 01:39:22,255
You were bait or you are bait?

860
01:39:26,468 --> 01:39:28,845
Belt! Belt, belt, dude.

861
01:39:37,187 --> 01:39:39,689
Two minutes.

862
01:39:40,273 --> 01:39:42,609
One minute.

863
01:40:07,342 --> 01:40:09,010
- A little help?
- Clear.

864
01:40:09,094 --> 01:40:11,388
Clear.

865
01:40:30,782 --> 01:40:33,952
My way out is a boat standing by in La Paz.

866
01:40:36,871 --> 01:40:40,000
Cargo drop, Atlas Mountains. So what?

867
01:40:40,083 --> 01:40:42,711
So at least apart we know what the odds are.

868
01:40:45,213 --> 01:40:47,716
Let's just call this what it is.

869
01:40:48,758 --> 01:40:51,344
And what it isn't.

870
01:40:55,265 --> 01:40:57,517
All right, so it's a crap marriage.

871
01:40:57,601 --> 01:41:01,313
All right, I'm a mess, you're a disaster.

872
01:41:01,396 --> 01:41:03,690
We're both liars.

873
01:41:05,150 --> 01:41:08,194
But you run, you'll always be running.

874
01:41:10,238 --> 01:41:12,908
I say we stay and fight.

875
01:41:12,991 --> 01:41:15,994
We finish this thing.

876
01:41:16,077 --> 01:41:18,288
Then if you want to go, you can go.

877
01:41:18,371 --> 01:41:20,582
Well, thank you.

878
01:41:20,665 --> 01:41:25,629
What? "Let's call this what it is."
Jesus Christ...

879
01:41:25,712 --> 01:41:28,048
- Stop...
- Don't.

880
01:42:20,475 --> 01:42:22,978
This is a really good store.

881
01:43:34,966 --> 01:43:38,929
- See you in the next life, Jane.
- Likewise, John.

882
01:45:21,239 --> 01:45:23,450
Sorry.

883
01:45:26,328 --> 01:45:29,623
We'll talk about this later.

884
01:45:43,345 --> 01:45:45,722
Jesus!

885
01:45:47,766 --> 01:45:51,394
- I didn't touch a thing.
- Yes, you did.

886
01:46:30,642 --> 01:46:34,938
- Sorry about the knife in the...
- I don't want to talk about it.

887
01:46:39,651 --> 01:46:42,028
- I'll fly.
- I'll be bait.

888
01:46:43,154 --> 01:46:46,116
I'm going clockwise. Watch my six.

889
01:47:34,789 --> 01:47:36,791
Go! Move!

890
01:48:51,741 --> 01:48:54,077
How's it look?

891
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:59,416
It's a piece of cake.

892
01:49:08,049 --> 01:49:10,468
Watch these, they tend to jam.

893
01:49:10,552 --> 01:49:12,888
So watch 'em.

894
01:49:13,763 --> 01:49:18,184
You favour your left,
sweetheart, so I'll cover right.

895
01:49:30,530 --> 01:49:35,952
Damn, that boat in La Paz is looking
pretty good right now, isn't it?

896
01:49:38,205 --> 01:49:41,499
Well, it rains a lot this time of year.

897
01:49:48,173 --> 01:49:53,178
There's nowhere I'd rather be
than right here, with you.

898
01:49:55,764 --> 01:49:57,766
Shut up.

899
01:51:26,771 --> 01:51:30,775
I'm interested in the progress
you've made in the last few weeks.

900
01:51:30,859 --> 01:51:35,947
Doing all right, aren't we? I'm not gonna lie
to you, there were times when I wanted to...

901
01:51:36,031 --> 01:51:38,575
<i>- ...kill her, but...
- Likewise.</i>

902
01:51:38,658 --> 01:51:41,202
- Couldn't take the shot.
- That's a good sign.

903
01:51:41,286 --> 01:51:43,997
- Who'd have thought?
- You have to battle through.

904
01:51:44,080 --> 01:51:48,877
- That's marriage, right?
- Yeah. Take your best shot, and...

905
01:51:48,960 --> 01:51:52,505
- Oh, we redid the house.
- We did. Yes, we did.

906
01:51:53,256 --> 01:51:56,718
You know there will always be challenges?
Threats out there?

907
01:51:56,801 --> 01:51:58,470
Yup.

908
01:51:58,553 --> 01:52:01,348
But you can handle it together.

909
01:52:01,431 --> 01:52:04,476
- So far.
- Yes, we can... So far?

910
01:52:05,518 --> 01:52:07,896
What is that?

911
01:52:07,979 --> 01:52:11,191
- I'm leaving room for the unknown.
- So far.

912
01:52:12,192 --> 01:52:16,029
And do you feel your relationship styles
are more conducive to this...

913
01:52:16,112 --> 01:52:18,990
Ask us the sex question.

914
01:52:19,074 --> 01:52:21,034
John.

915
01:52:22,035 --> 01:52:23,703
Well, that...

916
01:52:23,787 --> 01:52:26,498
Ten.

917
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,072
