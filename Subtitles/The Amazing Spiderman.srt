1
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,523
Five, four, three...

2
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:07,317
...two, one.

3
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,944
Ready or not, here I come.

4
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:25,646
Hey, Dad?

5
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:28,857
Dad!

6
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,213
<i>You'll stay with Aunt May...</i>

7
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,174
...and Uncle Ben for a little while.

8
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,509
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

9
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,016
Doesn't like crust
on his sandwiches...

10
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,435
...and he likes to sleep
with a little light on.

11
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:48,729
- Mary. Come on, come on.
- Oh, God.

12
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:54,443
Dad.

13
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:56,987
Be good.

14
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:15,589
Sorry.

15
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:17,591
Morning, Flash.

16
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,638
Good morning, Parker.

17
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,979
Hey. It's Peter, right?

18
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,233
I really like your photos.

19
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,026
Oh, thanks. Thanks.

20
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,152
Listen...

21
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,654
...are you busy Friday night?

22
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:47,162
Cool. Can you take pictures
of my boyfriend's car?

23
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,331
You know, I really wanna frame
a good one...

24
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,582
...for his birthday.

25
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,836
That's really nice of you.
Wow, that's such a nice thought.

26
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,338
Yeah, I'll have a look at the old...

27
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:58,257
- The old schedule.
- Okay.

28
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,551
Parker.

29
00:05:00,676 --> 00:05:02,761
- Yes, sir?
- You want to keep that skateboard?

30
00:05:02,928 --> 00:05:04,429
- Yeah.
- Keep it off the ground.

31
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:05,931
- Sure. Yeah.
- Wheels up.

32
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,224
Like that?

33
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,101
- That's it.
- Okay.

34
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:36,628
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

35
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,172
<i>Eat it! Eat it!</i>

36
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,883
<i>Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!</i>

37
00:05:41,049 --> 00:05:43,468
Eat your vegetables, Gordon.
Come on!

38
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,095
Come on!

39
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:46,430
Hey, Parker, come on.

40
00:05:46,597 --> 00:05:47,973
Get a picture of this.

41
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:51,310
No, I'm not gonna take a picture of it.
Put him down, man.

42
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:53,437
- Come on.
- Gordon, don't eat it.

43
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:54,646
Take the picture.

44
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:56,273
Put him down, Flash.

45
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,025
Take the picture.

46
00:05:58,192 --> 00:06:00,777
Put him down, Eugene!

47
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,157
Hey, man.

48
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,659
Come on!

49
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,493
Get up, Parker!

50
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:11,914
Get up!

51
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,707
Come on! Come on!

52
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:14,541
Get up!

53
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:18,837
Still not taking the picture.

54
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,672
Stay down, Parker!

55
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:22,674
Who wants one more?

56
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,426
- One more!
- Flash!

57
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,303
Flash...

58
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,347
...we still on for after school today?

59
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:29,640
My house, 3:30?

60
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,016
I hope you did homework.

61
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,684
Last time, I was...

62
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:34,478
...disappointed in you.

63
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,730
- Okay, move.
- No, how about we go to class?

64
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,106
How about it?

65
00:06:40,943 --> 00:06:42,486
Whatever.

66
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,471
I thought that was great
what you did.

67
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:11,473
It was stupid...

68
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,225
...but it was great.

69
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,102
You should go to...

70
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,020
...the nurse.
You might have a concussion.

71
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,065
What's your name?

72
00:07:20,649 --> 00:07:21,733
You don't know my name?

73
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,902
No, I know your name.

74
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:25,779
I want to know
if you know your name.

75
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,074
Peter.

76
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,327
- Parker. Peter Parker.
- Okay. Okay, good.

77
00:07:39,793 --> 00:07:41,587
I'd still go to the nurse though.

78
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,005
You're Gwen, right?

79
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:44,381
Gwen Stacy.

80
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,383
All right.

81
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,303
Hey.

82
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,387
I'm making...

83
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:52,264
...spaghetti and meatballs tonight.

84
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:55,100
You're serious?
Spaghetti and meatballs.

85
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,979
Since when don't you like
spaghetti and meatballs, huh?

86
00:07:59,438 --> 00:08:01,190
- Oh, my God.
- What's up?

87
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,900
What happened to your face?

88
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,444
I'm all right. Just-- I fell, skating.

89
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,196
It's all right.

90
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:09,907
Ben Parker, don't you even...

91
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,035
...think about leaving
that filthy box in my kitchen.

92
00:08:13,202 --> 00:08:14,244
My bowling trophies.

93
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:15,954
Oh, well, then, by all means...

94
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,623
...leave that box in my kitchen.

95
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,249
- What happened to you?
- He fell.

96
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,211
Why you kids ride those things,
I'll never know.

97
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:23,962
Because it's stupid and dangerous.

98
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:25,756
Remember when we were stupid?

99
00:08:25,923 --> 00:08:26,924
No.

100
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,218
- Trust me, we were.
- All right. Good to know.

101
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:30,302
Where's the flood?

102
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:31,970
Follow me. I'll show you.

103
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,347
- You serious?
- Yes.

104
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:35,140
All right.

105
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:37,976
<i>It's the condenser tray.</i>

106
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:41,730
Too much water for the condenser tray
or the heat exchange tubing.

107
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,815
This has got to be the fill line.

108
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,360
That's the only thing
that makes any sense.

109
00:08:46,527 --> 00:08:47,861
Can you fix it?

110
00:08:48,445 --> 00:08:51,281
No, not tonight.
I'll go by the hardware store tomorrow.

111
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:53,867
Good deal. And meanwhile,
put this on your face.

112
00:08:55,827 --> 00:08:57,579
How's the other guy look?

113
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,292
Come on.
I know a right cross when I see one.

114
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,255
Yes or no?
Do I have to call somebody's father?

115
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,714
No, no.

116
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,966
All right.

117
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,218
Well, I wouldn't tell your Aunt May.

118
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:14,680
I pity the poor kid
who'd have to suffer her wrath.

119
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,933
Before you come up, see if...

120
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,519
...there's anything else worth saving.
- Okay.

121
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,663
- Plumbers don't fix appliances.
- Yes, they do.

122
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,415
They fix pipes and pump things.

123
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,417
If you ask them to--

124
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:50,382
I forgot all about that thing.

125
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:51,425
It was your dad's.

126
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,427
- Yeah.
- He asked us to keep it safe.

127
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,851
He saw it in the window of that
leather shop over on 9th Avenue.

128
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,688
He was 19. What does a 19-year-old kid
need with a briefcase?

129
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,648
And guess who sold it to him.

130
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,483
- I don't know.
- Your mother.

131
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:09,735
That's how they met.

132
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,695
He asked you to...

133
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,822
...keep this safe?
There's nothing in here.

134
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:15,741
Have you looked?
There's nothing here.

135
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:18,035
Your father was
a very secretive man, Peter.

136
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,704
Yeah, I know.

137
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:27,711
Who's that?

138
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:29,421
Do you know who that is?

139
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,923
Some guy who worked with...

140
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,216
...your dad, I guess.

141
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,014
Just take this off the table, all right?

142
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:42,226
We're gonna eat. Off.
And wash your hands.

143
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,269
- Now.
- All right.

144
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,437
Go on.

145
00:11:21,265 --> 00:11:22,683
<i>I need you to be a good boy.</i>

146
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,976
Where are you going?

147
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:25,310
There's something...

148
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,479
...your mom and I have to do.

149
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:25,871
What is this?

150
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,001
"Zero, zero, decay rate algorithm."

151
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,422
Yeah, one sec, one sec.

152
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,224
Come in.

153
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:46,725
You okay?

154
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,228
- Yeah. What's up?
- Oh, my God.

155
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,687
You look just like him.

156
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,649
- Can I come in?
- Yeah.

157
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,988
Listen...

158
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:01,615
...I don't have much education.

159
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:03,242
You know that, Peter.

160
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,079
Hell, I stopped being able to help
with your homework when you were 10.

161
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,831
What I'm trying to say is...

162
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,751
...I know it's been rough
for you without your dad.

163
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,087
And I know we don't talk
much about them.

164
00:13:15,254 --> 00:13:17,172
- Yeah, it's all right.
- No, it is not...

165
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:18,715
...all right.

166
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:22,386
I wish I could change it, but I can't.

167
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:25,639
Curt Connors.

168
00:13:26,265 --> 00:13:29,059
That's the name of the guy
in the picture with your dad.

169
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,562
They worked together for years
and they were close.

170
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,106
But after that night,
we never saw him again.

171
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:36,233
He never even called.

172
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,609
Not once.

173
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:41,738
Go figure.

174
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:46,326
She's pretty.

175
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,791
Uncle Ben.

176
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,209
What?

177
00:13:54,793 --> 00:13:56,295
You're a pretty great dad.

178
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:53,644
Excuse me.

179
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:54,603
What?

180
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,355
Can I help you?

181
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,190
I don't know. I'm here to see...

182
00:14:58,357 --> 00:14:59,816
...Dr. Connors.
- Right.

183
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,860
You'll find yourself to the left.

184
00:15:03,695 --> 00:15:05,447
You are here for the internship?

185
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,699
Yeah. Yeah.

186
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:08,951
Okay.

187
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:10,994
You'll find your badge to the left.

188
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,876
Having trouble finding yourself?

189
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:19,545
No. Yeah, I got it.

190
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,881
Okay...

191
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,925
...Mr. Guevara.

192
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,180
<i>Welcome to Oscorp.</i>

193
00:15:30,347 --> 00:15:33,183
<i>Born from the mind of our founder,
Norman Osborn...</i>

194
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:37,020
<i>...the Oscorp Tower houses
108 floors of innovation.</i>

195
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:42,192
<i>Our scientific minds are pushing the
boundaries of defence, biomedical...</i>

196
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,153
<i>...and chemical technologies.
The future lies within.</i>

197
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:46,613
Welcome to Oscorp.

198
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,073
I'm Gwen Stacy, a senior...

199
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,116
...at Midtown Science...

200
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:50,701
...and head intern to Dr. Connors.

201
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:53,036
I'll be with you
for the duration of your visit.

202
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:54,872
Where I go, you go.

203
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,748
That's the rule. Remember that...

204
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:58,375
...all will be fine.
- Come on!

205
00:15:58,542 --> 00:15:59,918
- If you forget that--
- Listen!

206
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,003
Look, listen.

207
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,754
Tell them Rodrigo Guevara is here.

208
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:04,006
Just tell them...

209
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:05,215
...Rodrigo Guevara is here!

210
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,550
My name's Rodrigo!

211
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:09,553
I guess I don't need to tell you
what happens if you forget.

212
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:11,096
Shall we?

213
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:20,731
Come around this way.

214
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,111
Good afternoon, Gwen.

215
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:27,237
Dr. Connors.

216
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,156
Welcome.

217
00:16:29,323 --> 00:16:32,117
My name is Dr. Curtis Connors.

218
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,536
Yes, in case you're wondering,
I'm a southpaw.

219
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,954
I'm not a cripple...

220
00:16:36,121 --> 00:16:39,458
...I'm a scientist, and the world's
foremost authority on herpetology.

221
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:42,377
That's reptiles,
for those of you who don't know.

222
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,004
Like the Parkinson's patient...

223
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,882
...who watches on in horror
as her body...

224
00:16:47,049 --> 00:16:50,469
...slowly betrays her, or the man
with macular degeneration...

225
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:54,473
...whose eyes grow dimmer each day,
I long to fix myself.

226
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:58,477
I want to create a world
without weakness.

227
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,605
Anyone care to venture a guess
just how?

228
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:02,981
Yes.

229
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,107
Stem cells?

230
00:17:04,274 --> 00:17:05,859
Promising. But the solution...

231
00:17:06,026 --> 00:17:08,820
...I'm thinking of is more radical.

232
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,658
- No one?
- Cross-species genetics.

233
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:22,125
Person gets Parkinson's...

234
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,670
...when the brain cells
that produce dopamine...

235
00:17:24,837 --> 00:17:26,839
...start to disappear.

236
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,674
But a zebra fish has the ability...

237
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:31,051
...to regenerate cells on command.

238
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,136
If you could give this ability...

239
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:36,181
...to the woman you're talking about,
that's that. She's...

240
00:17:37,224 --> 00:17:38,559
She's curing herself.

241
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,603
Yeah, you just have to look past
the gills on her neck.

242
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,358
And you are...?

243
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,404
He's one of Midtown Science's...

244
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:52,072
...best and brightest.
- Really?

245
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,240
Second in his class.

246
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,201
- Second?
- Yeah.

247
00:17:56,368 --> 00:17:57,202
Sure about that?

248
00:17:57,369 --> 00:17:58,829
I'm pretty sure.

249
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,211
I'm afraid duty calls. I'll leave you in the
more-than-capable hands of Miss Stacy.

250
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,255
Nice meeting you all.

251
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:12,885
If you'd like to gather round.

252
00:18:13,051 --> 00:18:15,053
<i>Welcome to Oscorp's tree of life.</i>

253
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:18,640
<i>Our planet's tree of life is immense.</i>

254
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,350
<i>At Oscorp's...</i>

255
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:22,227
<i>-...Cross-Species Division...
- Hi.</i>

256
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:25,397
<i>...we endeavour to explore
exciting new methods...</i>

257
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,025
What are you doing, "Rodrigo"?

258
00:18:31,069 --> 00:18:32,321
Oh, yeah.

259
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,739
What are you doing here?

260
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,073
I work here. I don't.

261
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,825
I was gonna say I work here...

262
00:18:36,992 --> 00:18:40,204
...but it seems like you do work here.
So you know that I don't.

263
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,246
You following me?

264
00:18:41,413 --> 00:18:44,541
No, I'm not following you, no.
I had no idea you worked here.

265
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,918
Why would you be here?

266
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:47,920
I just snuck in because...

267
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,505
I love science.

268
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:51,465
- You love it.
- I'm passionate about it.

269
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:53,258
So you snuck in--?

270
00:18:53,425 --> 00:18:55,594
- I have to lead this tour group.
- I know.

271
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,680
I'll ask you more about this later.
Do not get me in trouble.

272
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:01,099
- I promise you I won't.
- Stay with the group.

273
00:19:01,767 --> 00:19:05,229
All right, guys? I'm gonna take you
to the bioreactor room now.

274
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,526
Sorry. Yo.

275
00:19:11,944 --> 00:19:13,028
Sorry.

276
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:40,050
We received the results from
the mRNA sequences this morning.

277
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:43,011
They were disappointing.

278
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,935
Define "disappointing."

279
00:21:50,102 --> 00:21:51,436
Another dead end.

280
00:21:51,603 --> 00:21:53,272
It's the decay rate algorithm.

281
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,941
- And this is to be expected.
- Expected?

282
00:21:56,108 --> 00:21:57,442
You said you were close.

283
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,778
We are close,
but it's gonna take time.

284
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:01,154
He doesn't have time.

285
00:22:01,321 --> 00:22:03,615
Norman Osborn is dying,
Dr. Connors.

286
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,409
Save him.

287
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:09,580
Or we'll both lose our heads.

288
00:22:27,973 --> 00:22:29,433
All right, give me the badge.

289
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:32,978
Give it to me.

290
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,025
Sorry.

291
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:41,296
Disgusting. Now I smell like beer.

292
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:44,049
I didn't mean to do that.

293
00:23:44,216 --> 00:23:45,634
I didn't mean to...

294
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:47,553
ldidn't-- I didn't--

295
00:23:48,887 --> 00:23:50,055
Get your hand off her!

296
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,890
I'm trying to get my...

297
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,478
Are you kidding?

298
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:57,437
I'm sorry.

299
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,814
Are you kidding me?

300
00:23:59,398 --> 00:24:01,108
- Hey, get him, Rudy!
- Hey!

301
00:24:04,403 --> 00:24:05,571
Ma". I'm sorry!

302
00:24:05,737 --> 00:24:06,822
Man, are you all right?

303
00:24:09,741 --> 00:24:11,285
- Take him down!
- Come on.

304
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:15,497
Get him, man! Get him!

305
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:19,543
No, man, no. Not my board.

306
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:21,003
Please, dude, don't--

307
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:24,006
Sorry!

308
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,969
Sorry. Sorry.

309
00:24:29,136 --> 00:24:30,429
I'm so sorry.

310
00:24:34,433 --> 00:24:36,935
<i>Coney Island, next stop.</i>

311
00:24:37,102 --> 00:24:39,062
<i>Next and final stop, Coney Island.</i>

312
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:51,742
Hey.

313
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,244
Hey. HEY-

314
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:55,621
Sorry. I'm late.

315
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,456
- I got--
- We've been so worried.

316
00:24:57,623 --> 00:24:58,749
I know. I'm sorry.

317
00:24:58,916 --> 00:25:00,250
Watch out!

318
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:08,509
That's a fly, Peter.

319
00:25:12,638 --> 00:25:14,223
Yeah.

320
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,687
I'm so sorry...

321
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:22,022
...I kept you guys UP-

322
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:25,526
I'm insensitive, I'm irresponsible...

323
00:25:26,068 --> 00:25:27,486
...and I'm hungry.

324
00:25:31,907 --> 00:25:33,575
Meatloaf.

325
00:25:36,119 --> 00:25:37,329
Drinking?

326
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:38,539
What's this?

327
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,082
I don't think so.

328
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:41,917
This is your meatloaf.

329
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,171
This beats all other meat loafs.

330
00:25:47,464 --> 00:25:49,466
Something is very wrong.

331
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:51,134
Yeah.

332
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:53,345
Nobody likes your meatloaf.

333
00:25:59,518 --> 00:26:01,019
I got it.

334
00:26:04,523 --> 00:26:06,859
He took the frozen
macaroni and cheese.

335
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:08,861
I noticed that.

336
00:26:09,945 --> 00:26:12,656
Why didn't you tell me
you didn't like my meatloaf?

337
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:15,117
You could have said that to me
37 years ago.

338
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:17,953
How many meat loafs
have I made for you?

339
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:09,875
Peter.

340
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,377
What are you doing?

341
00:29:12,544 --> 00:29:14,046
'M...

342
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,131
Homework.

343
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:17,841
Be careful.

344
00:29:18,008 --> 00:29:19,593
Sure.

345
00:29:28,769 --> 00:29:30,229
Dr. Connors.

346
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,732
You don't remember me. I--

347
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:35,150
The intern from the other day.

348
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,402
Yeah, yeah. That's right, yeah.

349
00:29:37,569 --> 00:29:39,863
I'm sure you're very nice,
but this is a home.

350
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,366
I ask you to make an appointment
with my office.

351
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:43,909
I'm Richard Parker's son.

352
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:52,376
Peter?

353
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:55,671
I'm afraid...

354
00:29:55,838 --> 00:29:59,132
...I can't help you much. I don't know
why they left or where they...

355
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,050
...were going.

356
00:30:02,845 --> 00:30:04,304
Good reflexes.

357
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:05,848
Thank you.

358
00:30:10,853 --> 00:30:12,938
- Thank you.
- I read your book.

359
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,565
Yeah.

360
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:15,899
It's something, you know.

361
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:17,860
So you really think...

362
00:30:18,026 --> 00:30:20,737
...it's possible, cross-species genetics?
- Yes, of course.

363
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:23,365
Your father and I
were mocked for our theories.

364
00:30:23,532 --> 00:30:26,285
Not just in the community at large,
but at Oscorp, as well.

365
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:28,579
They called us mad scientists.

366
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:32,082
And then your father
bred the spiders...

367
00:30:32,249 --> 00:30:33,625
...and everything changed.

368
00:30:33,792 --> 00:30:35,460
The results were
beyond encouraging.

369
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,588
They were spectacular.

370
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,718
We were gonna change
the lives of millions.

371
00:30:42,885 --> 00:30:44,845
Including my own.

372
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,930
Then it was over.

373
00:30:47,806 --> 00:30:50,726
He was gone.

374
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:53,395
Took his research with him.

375
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:57,065
And I knew without him, I...

376
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:06,241
I----

377
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,995
I was angry.

378
00:31:12,748 --> 00:31:14,249
So I stayed away from you...

379
00:31:14,416 --> 00:31:16,335
...and your family.

380
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:18,420
And for that, I'm truly sorry.

381
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,430
Say...

382
00:31:29,056 --> 00:31:30,182
Say it worked.

383
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,518
Say you got it to work.

384
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:36,980
Like, how much would
the foreign species take over?

385
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:40,025
What could the side effects be?

386
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:46,823
It's hard to say,
considering no subject survived.

387
00:31:47,282 --> 00:31:48,617
The problem was always--

388
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:50,202
The decay rate algorithm?

389
00:31:53,121 --> 00:31:54,665
- Right.
- Right.

390
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:57,209
Can I...?

391
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,044
Of course.

392
00:32:21,567 --> 00:32:22,901
Extraordinary.

393
00:32:23,569 --> 00:32:25,362
How did you come up with this?

394
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:34,663
Peter, how about coming
to see me at the Tower...

395
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,748
...one day after school?
- Yeah.

396
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:40,711
Thank you.

397
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:02,357
Number one, Reggie.

398
00:33:02,524 --> 00:33:03,442
Run it, buddy.

399
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:05,152
Let's go. Reggie-

400
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:09,323
Rejected!

401
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:13,702
You did that on purpose, Flash!

402
00:33:13,869 --> 00:33:15,954
I should've.
You better watch your back.

403
00:33:19,917 --> 00:33:21,585
Hey.

404
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:24,421
All right?

405
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:31,970
Give it up.

406
00:33:37,476 --> 00:33:38,560
Come on, man.

407
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:41,480
One sec.

408
00:33:44,816 --> 00:33:47,277
- Come on, man.
- Why don't you take it from me?

409
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,699
That's right. Take it.

410
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:54,493
Go ahead. Take it.

411
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:16,306
Just take it.

412
00:34:18,684 --> 00:34:20,853
All right, how about this?

413
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:22,688
All right?

414
00:34:22,855 --> 00:34:23,772
How about that?

415
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:30,153
- Come on, Flash.
- Flash, stop playing, man.

416
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,447
- Take it from him!
- Come on, Flash. Take it.

417
00:34:32,614 --> 00:34:33,949
Yo, Flash, let's go.

418
00:34:34,116 --> 00:34:35,617
- Let's go!
- Do it, Flash.

419
00:34:35,784 --> 00:34:37,536
- Stop playing, man.
- Let's go, Flash.

420
00:34:37,703 --> 00:34:39,371
- What are you doing?
- What's up?

421
00:34:41,123 --> 00:34:41,915
What you doing?

422
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,045
All right, bring it!
Come on, Parker! Come on!

423
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:02,227
Peter's behaviour is just...

424
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:03,187
...unacceptable.

425
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:04,229
<i>They won't make us pay...</i>

426
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:07,232
-...for the backboard.
- I don't care about the backboard.

427
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,109
- Was that true?
- What?

428
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:11,069
What I heard in there just now.

429
00:35:11,236 --> 00:35:14,198
Did you humiliate that boy?

430
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:16,241
Yeah, I did.

431
00:35:17,409 --> 00:35:18,410
- But--
- But what?

432
00:35:18,577 --> 00:35:20,037
- This guy deserved it.
- Did he?

433
00:35:20,204 --> 00:35:21,914
- Yeah.
- Is he the kid that hit you?

434
00:35:24,249 --> 00:35:25,501
Is he?

435
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:27,503
Yeah, yeah, but...

436
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:29,755
So all this is about getting even.

437
00:35:30,255 --> 00:35:33,759
If so, I guess you must feel pretty good
about yourself now, right?

438
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:34,927
Am I right or wrong?

439
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,514
Yeah, I thought so.

440
00:35:39,139 --> 00:35:41,475
Well, thanks to this
little escapade of yours...

441
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:43,602
...I had to change shifts at work...

442
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:47,439
...so you have to pick up Aunt May
tonight at 9:00. Understood?

443
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,399
- Is that understood?
- Yeah.

444
00:35:49,566 --> 00:35:51,276
Okay, good.

445
00:35:53,612 --> 00:35:54,738
She looks familiar.

446
00:35:57,282 --> 00:35:58,742
The girl on your computer.

447
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:00,577
Yeah.

448
00:36:00,702 --> 00:36:03,705
He's got you on his computer.
I'm his probation officer.

449
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,124
Don't forget Aunt May.

450
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:11,630
Okay.

451
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,219
He's a character.

452
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:18,387
That's my uncle.

453
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:20,597
He's a pathological liar.

454
00:36:20,764 --> 00:36:22,140
He thought you were someone else.

455
00:36:22,307 --> 00:36:24,810
Oh, man, you don't have me
on your computer?

456
00:36:24,977 --> 00:36:28,105
I took a photo of the debate team,
and you're in the debate team.

457
00:36:28,272 --> 00:36:29,982
- Right.
- So...

458
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:32,484
...he must have seen--
I was touching up stuff.

459
00:36:33,318 --> 00:36:34,820
- Touching up stuff?
- Come on.

460
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:37,656
I was... I'm not gonna answer that.

461
00:36:39,741 --> 00:36:42,244
- Did you get expelled?
- No, no.

462
00:36:42,369 --> 00:36:44,621
I didn't get expelled.
I got community service.

463
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:50,878
So you want to-- I don't know...?

464
00:36:52,379 --> 00:36:53,172
Want to what?

465
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:55,048
I don't know.

466
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:56,925
Just...

467
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:04,641
I don't know-- We could...

468
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:07,603
We could do something else,
or we could--

469
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:10,230
- If you don't feel like, we could--
- Yeah.

470
00:37:10,397 --> 00:37:11,940
- Yeah?
- Yeah, either one.

471
00:37:13,358 --> 00:37:15,485
- Really?
- Sure.

472
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,196
Okay.

473
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,697
All right, good. Sounds good.

474
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:19,823
Cool.

475
00:37:20,365 --> 00:37:21,867
Okay.

476
00:37:22,034 --> 00:37:24,369
- I can't right now, I can't right now.
- Yeah, no.

477
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,705
- I'm so busy right now.
- I know, me too.

478
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:31,877
But maybe...

479
00:37:32,044 --> 00:37:34,213
- Yeah, just, you know...
- Some other...

480
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,048
- Time, all right.
- Okay.

481
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:37,883
- Bye.
- All right.

482
00:39:05,846 --> 00:39:08,515
We have protein structure, rDNA...

483
00:39:08,682 --> 00:39:10,767
...chromatography,
transgenics testing...

484
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,188
...that's X-ray video. That's the only
one on the planet. We have...

485
00:39:14,605 --> 00:39:17,149
- Human line testing over--
- I remember that.

486
00:39:17,316 --> 00:39:18,984
I've seen that before.

487
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,444
The Ganali device.

488
00:39:20,611 --> 00:39:23,322
Yeah, I remember a picture of that
in my dad's office.

489
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,991
The idea was so simple.
You load it with an antigen.

490
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:29,620
It creates a cloud which can be dispersed
over a neighbourhood, even a city.

491
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:33,165
Theoretically, you could
cure polio in an afternoon.

492
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,334
That's incredible.

493
00:39:35,459 --> 00:39:38,754
Well, others disagreed. What if
the device were loaded with a toxin?

494
00:39:38,921 --> 00:39:40,923
What if you wanted to opt out?
You can't...

495
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,510
...run away from a cloud after all,
so here it lies, gathering dust.

496
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,971
What you see here
is a computer model of a lizard.

497
00:39:48,138 --> 00:39:51,350
Many of these wonderful creatures
have so brilliantly adapted...

498
00:39:51,517 --> 00:39:54,019
...that they can regenerate
entire limbs at will.

499
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:56,021
You can imagine my envy.

500
00:39:56,188 --> 00:39:58,106
We're trying to harness
this capability...

501
00:39:58,273 --> 00:40:00,526
...and transfer it
into our host subject:

502
00:40:00,692 --> 00:40:02,945
Freddy the three-legged mouse.

503
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:06,156
Enter the algorithm now.

504
00:40:09,368 --> 00:40:10,327
Need to take that?

505
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:17,125
<i>System ready...</i>

506
00:40:17,292 --> 00:40:18,877
<i>...for gene insertion.</i>

507
00:40:19,044 --> 00:40:20,671
Okay.

508
00:40:21,213 --> 00:40:22,589
Check.

509
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:25,676
See what I'm trying to do?

510
00:40:25,843 --> 00:40:27,719
- Preempt the proteins.
- The immune response.

511
00:40:27,886 --> 00:40:29,054

525
00:40:58,876 --> 00:41:00,752
And thank you.

526
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:02,629
Meet Fred and Wilma...

527
00:41:02,838 --> 00:41:04,089
...our three-legged...

528
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,382
...mice.

529
00:41:08,468 --> 00:41:09,511
Here you go.

530
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,015
HEY. buddy. I got you.

531
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:15,642
Okay.

532
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:17,895
Careful, don't want to stick you
by mistake.

533
00:41:18,061 --> 00:41:19,938
Human trials aren't until next week.

534
00:41:22,858 --> 00:41:23,734
There.

535
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:32,868
Hey.

536
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:35,412
Hey, I thought you...

537
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:37,497
Didn't you forget something?

538
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:39,416
What?

539
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:43,420
Now, don't answer that,
but I'm glad to know it's working.

540
00:41:44,463 --> 00:41:48,383
You owe your aunt
an apology bigtime.

541
00:41:50,469 --> 00:41:51,386
Be a man.

542
00:41:51,512 --> 00:41:53,263
Get in there and apologise.

543
00:41:56,725 --> 00:41:58,227
I'm sorry, Aunt May, I...

544
00:41:58,352 --> 00:41:59,686
Honestly, you don't have...

545
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:01,438
...to apologise to me. It's your--

546
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:03,398
- The hell he doesn't.
- Ben.

547
00:42:04,274 --> 00:42:06,151
Look, I'm sorry, I got distracted.

548
00:42:06,318 --> 00:42:08,237
- Oh, he got distracted.
- Yeah.

549
00:42:08,403 --> 00:42:11,532
Your aunt, my wife,
had to walk 12 blocks alone...

550
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:15,160
...in the middle of the night and then
wait in a deserted subway station...

551
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:16,578
...because you got distracted.

552
00:42:16,745 --> 00:42:18,413
Ben, sweetheart, honestly...

553
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:20,624
...I am completely capable
of walking home--

554
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:22,835
You will not defend this boy!

555
00:42:23,001 --> 00:42:24,294
- I'm not defending--
- You are!

556
00:42:24,419 --> 00:42:26,964
- Listen to me, son.
- Yeah, go ahead.

557
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,674
You're a lot like your father.

558
00:42:28,841 --> 00:42:31,343
You really are, Peter,
and that's a good thing...

559
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:34,638
...but your father lived by a philosophy,
a principle, really.

560
00:42:34,805 --> 00:42:38,141
He believed that if you could do
good things for other people...

561
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:40,769
...you had a moral obligation
to do those things.

562
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,521
That's what's at stake here.

563
00:42:42,646 --> 00:42:43,689
Not choice.

564
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:45,858
Responsibility.

565
00:42:48,026 --> 00:42:50,529
That is nice. That's great.

566
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:53,657
That's all well and good.
So where is he?

567
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:56,743
- What?
- Where is he?

568
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:58,871
Where's my dad?

569
00:42:59,037 --> 00:43:02,541
He didn't think it was his responsibility
to be here to tell me himself?

570
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,042
Oh, come on, how dare you?

571
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:05,919
How dare I? How dare you?

572
00:43:10,549 --> 00:43:11,550
Where you going?

573
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:13,510
Peter, come back here, please.

574
00:43:23,061 --> 00:43:26,190
Ben, leave him alone for a little while.
He'll be all right.

575
00:43:39,203 --> 00:43:40,204
Peter!

576
00:43:42,873 --> 00:43:44,416
Peter?

577
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:51,423
Peter!

578
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:57,471
It's $2.07.

579
00:44:00,933 --> 00:44:01,975
It's $2.07.

580
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:03,477
Yeah. No, I know.

581
00:44:03,644 --> 00:44:06,480
Yeah, you're holding up the line. No.

582
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:08,941
You can leave a penny,
you can't take a penny.

583
00:44:10,025 --> 00:44:11,276
- What?
- You can leave...

584
00:44:11,485 --> 00:44:14,112
...a penny anytime,
you have to spend 10 dollars...

585
00:44:14,279 --> 00:44:16,198
...to take a penny.
It's store policy.

586
00:44:16,365 --> 00:44:18,784
- You're holding up my line.
- I don't have 2 cents.

587
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,619
You can't afford milk, step aside.

588
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:23,038
Daddy didn't give you
enough milk money today?

589
00:44:23,205 --> 00:44:24,540
We're talking about 2 cents.

590
00:44:24,706 --> 00:44:25,749
Just step aside, kid.

591
00:44:32,589 --> 00:44:33,674
Really?

592
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:48,438
Yo, not cool, bro.

593
00:44:51,149 --> 00:44:52,317
Hey, man, stop!

594
00:44:52,442 --> 00:44:53,944
Somebody stop that guy!

595
00:44:54,111 --> 00:44:55,487
Hey, kid, little help?

596
00:44:55,612 --> 00:44:57,030
Not my policy.

597
00:44:57,447 --> 00:44:58,657
Somebody stop that dude!

598
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:00,325
Hey!

599
00:45:00,492 --> 00:45:01,785
Hey, stop!

600
00:45:02,911 --> 00:45:04,580
Somebody stop that dude!

601
00:45:13,255 --> 00:45:14,131
Hey!

602
00:45:44,661 --> 00:45:46,538
Oh, God, oh, God.

603
00:45:46,705 --> 00:45:48,248
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

604
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:50,501
Call an ambulance!

605
00:45:50,667 --> 00:45:53,086
Someone call an ambulance!
Uncle Ben, Uncle Ben.

606
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:55,380
Oh, God, oh, my God.

607
00:45:59,051 --> 00:46:00,761
On, God.

608
00:46:04,139 --> 00:46:05,516
No.

609
00:46:07,684 --> 00:46:09,645
Oh, Jesus.

610
00:46:13,565 --> 00:46:17,528
Witnesses gave a description to the
sketch artist. I need you to take a look.

611
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:23,742
No, I don't know him.

612
00:46:24,701 --> 00:46:27,454
I didn't expect you would, ma'am.
Homicide detectives...

613
00:46:27,621 --> 00:46:29,581
...are on it.
We'll see what they turn up.

614
00:46:29,748 --> 00:46:31,416
Okay.

615
00:46:36,964 --> 00:46:38,382
Can I have that?

616
00:46:38,549 --> 00:46:39,925
Sure.

617
00:46:42,261 --> 00:46:44,221
There's one other thing.
He has a star...

618
00:46:44,388 --> 00:46:45,138
<i>tattooed...</i>

619
00:46:45,305 --> 00:46:46,557
<i>...on his left hand.</i>

620
00:47:14,042 --> 00:47:18,547
<i>Peter, I know things
have been difficult lately...</i>

621
00:47:19,006 --> 00:47:20,841
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

622
00:47:21,425 --> 00:47:23,635
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

623
00:47:39,776 --> 00:47:41,445
Hey, Parker.

624
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:44,573
- Not today.
- Come on, I just want to talk.

625
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,663
It feels better, right?

626
00:47:52,664 --> 00:47:54,166
Look, your uncle died.

627
00:47:54,833 --> 00:47:56,293
I'm sorry.

628
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:57,920
I get it.

629
00:47:58,337 --> 00:47:59,880
I'm sorry.

630
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,840
Okay?

631
00:48:08,138 --> 00:48:09,389
Peter.

632
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:54,059
Stay away from him.

633
00:48:54,226 --> 00:48:55,227
- You understand?
- Hey!

634
00:48:55,394 --> 00:48:56,812
- Stay away from Joey.
- Hey!

635
00:48:59,064 --> 00:49:00,357
You like beating on girls?

636
00:49:00,691 --> 00:49:02,067
You like beating on old men?

637
00:49:02,234 --> 00:49:02,901
Hey, pal...

638
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:03,861
...keep walking.

639
00:49:04,027 --> 00:49:06,446
- You're in the wrong place.
- When were you in Queens?

640
00:49:07,072 --> 00:49:08,282
I asked you a question.

641
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,366
Nicky, no!

642
00:49:09,533 --> 00:49:10,242
That the gun?

643
00:49:10,409 --> 00:49:11,493
You gonna kill me too?

644
00:49:13,495 --> 00:49:14,621
Hey! Stop it!

645
00:49:15,539 --> 00:49:16,456
Hey. get off!

646
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,876
Wait, oh, don't hit Nicky!

647
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:20,252
Back up!

648
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,046
This guy is crazy!

649
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:24,923
Get him!

650
00:49:29,428 --> 00:49:31,680
Get back here, man! Get him!

651
00:49:38,437 --> 00:49:39,271
Follow him!

652
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,651
- Go around, man!
- I'll follow you!

653
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:54,786
Go, go, go!

654
00:49:56,121 --> 00:49:57,331
There he is!

655
00:49:57,497 --> 00:49:58,332
Can't get away!

656
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:16,808
<i>He has a star tattooed
on his left hand.</i>

657
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:29,571
Oh, yeah?

658
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:30,739
Come on!

659
00:50:38,163 --> 00:50:39,706
I know what you look like!

660
00:50:39,873 --> 00:50:41,667
You hear me?

661
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:44,461
I've seen your face!

662
00:51:22,207 --> 00:51:23,876
Is that all you got?

663
00:51:25,544 --> 00:51:27,045
Just take it, take it.

664
00:51:32,384 --> 00:51:35,220
<i>Engineered from
genetically enhanced spiders...</i>

665
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:39,808
<i>...Oscorp's BioCable tensile strength
is unparalleled. We're just beginning...</i>

666
00:51:39,975 --> 00:51:43,729
<i>...to understand all the potential
industrial applications.</i>

667
00:51:43,896 --> 00:51:47,399
<i>A single pellet can safely store
several hundred metres...</i>

668
00:51:47,566 --> 00:51:49,401
<i>...of the lightweight cable.</i>

669
00:51:58,368 --> 00:51:59,161
Mother...

670
00:52:56,677 --> 00:53:01,348
<i>Attention, all units in the confines
of Precinct 13, receiving a 10-30...</i>

671
00:53:01,515 --> 00:53:03,809
<i>...on West 19th Street
and Broadway.</i>

672
00:53:03,976 --> 00:53:06,728
<i>Assailant is Caucasian male,

673
00:53:06,895 --> 00:53:09,815
<i>...170 to 180 pounds...</i>

674
00:53:09,982 --> 00:53:11,358
<i>...shoulder-length blond hair.</i>

675
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,152
<i>Last seen on foot
heading eastbound on 19th Street.</i>

676
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,047
Hey.

677
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:43,849
You got a description?

678
00:53:44,016 --> 00:53:45,225
Well, no, he wears a mask.

679
00:53:45,851 --> 00:53:47,019
A mask?

680
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:48,353
Most of his victims...

681
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:51,899
...are suspects with serious rap sheets.
They're calling him a vigilante.

682
00:53:52,065 --> 00:53:54,443
Okay, he's not a vigilante,
he's an anarchist.

683
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:57,237
Help me, somebody! Arrest me!

684
00:53:57,404 --> 00:53:58,530
Get me out of here.

685
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:01,283
Hey, look!

686
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:14,379
Spandex. Spandex.

687
00:54:15,172 --> 00:54:16,173
Everything...

688
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:17,216
...spandex.

689
00:54:17,549 --> 00:54:19,718
Extraordinary velocity vector
is a function...

690
00:54:19,885 --> 00:54:21,720
...of both mass and acceleration.

691
00:54:21,887 --> 00:54:23,680
Come on,
you know better than anyone...

692
00:54:23,847 --> 00:54:26,308
...the weight on any pendulum
has no effect on speed.

693
00:54:26,475 --> 00:54:30,229
It doesn't affect frequency,
but it's totally a factor in momentum.

694
00:55:06,598 --> 00:55:08,058
Hey, Aunt May.

695
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,561
Yeah.Eggs?

696
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:11,979
Organic, got it.

697
00:55:12,020 --> 00:55:12,437


698
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:46,722
In the future,
if you're gonna steal cars...

699
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,849
...don't dress like a car thief, man.

700
00:55:49,016 --> 00:55:50,559
What are you? You a cop?

701
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:55,647
Really? You seriously think I'm a cop?
Cop in a skin-tight red-and-blue suit?

702
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:57,316
You know, you're...

703
00:55:58,066 --> 00:55:59,484
You've got a mind...

704
00:55:59,651 --> 00:56:01,111
...of the true scholar, sir.

705
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,655
I was going more for the guys
who do the luge.

706
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:05,324
Good thinking.

707
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,034
Get out the window.

708
00:56:07,201 --> 00:56:08,493
There you go. You got it.

709
00:56:16,919 --> 00:56:18,337
Crotch!

710
00:56:21,173 --> 00:56:23,509
- Just let me go.
- Is that a real knife?

711
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:24,843
Yes, it's a real knife.

712
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:26,512
My weakness, it's small knives.

713
00:56:26,678 --> 00:56:28,263
- Just let me go.
- Anything but...

714
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:30,349
...knives! Oh, it's so simple.

715
00:56:30,516 --> 00:56:31,975
- That was cool.
- What is this?

716
00:56:32,142 --> 00:56:34,728
Webbing I developed.
I don't think you want to know.

717
00:56:34,895 --> 00:56:35,562
Let me go!

718
00:56:37,481 --> 00:56:39,191
Okay, one second.
Hold on, one second.

719
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:40,484
Knock it off, man. No!

720
00:56:41,735 --> 00:56:44,029
Come on, let me go. Stop it!

721
00:56:44,863 --> 00:56:45,906
That isn't funny.

722
00:56:46,073 --> 00:56:47,533
- It is kind of funny.
- Help!

723
00:56:58,418 --> 00:56:59,878
This could've gone a lot worse.

724
00:57:00,045 --> 00:57:02,005
Now hold still.

725
00:57:07,553 --> 00:57:08,887
Boys in blue here.

726
00:57:09,054 --> 00:57:11,557
- Yo, I got him.
- Freeze!

727
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:13,559
- He's not going anywhere.
- Don't move.

728
00:57:13,725 --> 00:57:14,726
You serious?

729
00:57:14,893 --> 00:57:16,061
Who are you?

730
00:57:16,478 --> 00:57:18,188
No one grasps
the concept of the mask.

731
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:19,147
Freeze!

732
00:57:22,150 --> 00:57:23,735
I just did 80 percent of your job.

733
00:57:24,278 --> 00:57:25,028
And that?

734
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:26,113
That's how you repay me?

735
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:30,909
Hold it right there!

736
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:52,973
Well, that was fun.

737
00:57:54,433 --> 00:57:56,059
Bus! Hey there, everybody.

738
00:58:00,022 --> 00:58:01,148
What are you doing?

739
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:06,820
Hey, watch out.

740
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:08,113
I'm swinging here.

741
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:09,781
I'm swinging here.

742
00:58:24,922 --> 00:58:27,674
So 38 of New York's finest...

743
00:58:27,841 --> 00:58:31,011
...versus one guy in a unitard.

744
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:33,138
Am I correct?

745
00:58:47,152 --> 00:58:48,695
You don't have to wait up for me.

746
00:58:48,862 --> 00:58:50,155
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

747
00:58:50,322 --> 00:58:51,323
Yes, I do.

748
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,824
- Okay.
- Where were you?

749
00:58:52,991 --> 00:58:54,034
I was out.

750
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:56,161
Did you get the eggs?

751
00:58:57,704 --> 00:58:59,206
Nope. Forgot the eggs.

752
00:58:59,373 --> 00:59:00,582
I'm gonna get them now.

753
00:59:00,749 --> 00:59:02,334
No, you most certainly will not.

754
00:59:02,501 --> 00:59:04,503
Not at this hour.

755
00:59:06,338 --> 00:59:08,215
Look at me, Peter.

756
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:12,553
Take off the damn hood
and look at me.

757
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:23,355
Peter. Where do you go?

758
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:24,982
Who does this to you?

759
00:59:25,148 --> 00:59:26,942
Please go to sleep, Aunt May.

760
00:59:27,109 --> 00:59:29,111
- Please tell me.
- Aunt May, please...

761
00:59:29,278 --> 00:59:31,321
...please, please go to sleep.

762
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,533
I can't sleep.
Don't you understand? I can't sleep.

763
00:59:46,044 --> 00:59:48,547
Peter, listen to me.

764
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:50,465
Secrets have a cost.

765
00:59:50,632 --> 00:59:52,176
They're not for free.

766
00:59:52,342 --> 00:59:54,553
Not now, not ever.

767
01:00:02,269 --> 01:00:04,229
Cross-species genetics
is finally working.

768
01:00:04,563 --> 01:00:07,733
I've used the lizard DNA
to help Freddy regrow that limb.

769
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,484
It's a miracle.

770
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:11,236
No, it's hard work and promise.

771
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:15,324
- It's a step closer to the primate lab.
- He doesn't have time for every little step.

772
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:16,408
Little?

773
01:00:16,575 --> 01:00:18,118
I just mean he can't wait.

774
01:00:18,285 --> 01:00:19,953
Well, he'll have to.

775
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:22,039
Unless he wants to be a lab rat.

776
01:00:22,206 --> 01:00:23,081
That's not what...

777
01:00:23,248 --> 01:00:24,082
...I'm saying-

778
01:00:24,249 --> 01:00:25,417
So, what are you saying?

779
01:00:26,084 --> 01:00:28,378
You have to start human trials.

780
01:00:29,087 --> 01:00:29,838
Now.

781
01:00:30,005 --> 01:00:32,174
No, I don't, and no, I won't.

782
01:00:32,341 --> 01:00:34,301
- Well, then he's going to die.
- People die.

783
01:00:35,594 --> 01:00:37,513
Even Norman Osborn.

784
01:00:37,679 --> 01:00:38,680
We are not finished.

785
01:00:38,847 --> 01:00:40,432
Human trials?

786
01:00:40,599 --> 01:00:43,185
Where are you going
to find the people to volunteer?

787
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:45,938
As far as anyone's concerned,
it's for a flu shot.

788
01:00:46,104 --> 01:00:48,982
I might think the Veterans Hospital
is a place to start.

789
01:00:49,149 --> 01:00:50,484
You've gotta be kidding me.

790
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:52,694
I don't think I am.

791
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:01,453
It's a little late for
shock and indignation.

792
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:02,746
About 15 years late.

793
01:01:02,955 --> 01:01:04,790
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

794
01:01:04,957 --> 01:01:06,458
Richard Parker wore it well.

795
01:01:06,625 --> 01:01:09,461
On you, it's a cheap suit,
as it was then.

796
01:01:09,628 --> 01:01:11,088
I had nothing to do with that.

797
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:12,798
Is that what you told his son?

798
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:19,763
I don't know what you're saying.

799
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:22,474
You don't know,
or you don't wanna know?

800
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,311
I'll remind you what happened.

801
01:01:26,478 --> 01:01:29,940
Richard Parker said just about the same
thing then that you are saying now.

802
01:01:32,317 --> 01:01:35,487
The clock is ticking, Dr. Connors.

803
01:01:36,488 --> 01:01:38,240
I----

804
01:01:45,873 --> 01:01:47,499
I won't.

805
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,336
Fine.

806
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:58,635
The formula is ours now anyway.

807
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,598
Say goodbye to that arm
you have dreamed of.

808
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,308
I'm shutting you down.

809
01:02:04,474 --> 01:02:07,394
Have your office cleared out
by the morning.

810
01:02:07,561 --> 01:02:11,064
Your toys can be taken away too,
you know.

811
01:02:13,192 --> 01:02:14,276
Right, Freddy?

812
01:02:29,499 --> 01:02:30,542
- Hey.
- Hi.

813
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:31,502
How's it going?

814
01:02:31,668 --> 01:02:32,878
Where you headed?

815
01:02:33,879 --> 01:02:36,423
- Monday, B track.
- Oh, it's Thursday.

816
01:02:36,924 --> 01:02:38,550
- It's Thursday?
- What happened?

817
01:02:38,717 --> 01:02:40,385
- What?
- Your eye, it looks bruised.

818
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:41,803
Oh, yeah, no, I don't...

819
01:02:41,970 --> 01:02:43,597
Maybe I got a rash or...

820
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:45,557
It's bad.
Have you gone to the nurse?

821
01:02:47,809 --> 01:02:49,520
Do you like branzino?

822
01:02:50,562 --> 01:02:51,897
Like, a fish

823
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:53,899
No, no. I know. I know.

824
01:02:54,066 --> 01:02:56,276
Well, if you want...

825
01:02:56,443 --> 01:03:00,948
...you can come to this address
at 8:00 tonight.

826
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,408
My mom's making branzino.

827
01:03:03,909 --> 01:03:05,327
So...

828
01:03:05,536 --> 01:03:06,370
It's apartment...

829
01:03:06,537 --> 01:03:08,872
...2016. I didn't write that part down.

830
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,374
I don't know why I...

831
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,376
- I'll remember it.
- Oh, okay.

832
01:03:12,543 --> 01:03:13,919
2016.

833
01:04:21,987 --> 01:04:23,322
Hi.

834
01:04:24,656 --> 01:04:25,908
How did you get out there?

835
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:28,327
The fire escape.

836
01:04:29,494 --> 01:04:30,996
Your doorman's intimidating.

837
01:04:31,914 --> 01:04:33,540
It's 20 storeys.

838
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,334
Yeah. It's all right.

839
01:04:39,505 --> 01:04:41,507
- This is your room.
- Yes, this is my room.

840
01:04:41,673 --> 01:04:43,342
Books.

841
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,010
Shoes.

842
01:04:45,636 --> 01:04:47,137
Oh, hey...

843
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:49,556
I got your mom...

844
01:04:49,723 --> 01:04:51,099
...these.

845
01:04:51,350 --> 01:04:52,351
Oh, lovely.

846
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:54,186
- Beautiful, right?
- Beautiful.

847
01:04:54,353 --> 01:04:55,729
They were nice.

848
01:04:55,896 --> 01:04:57,689
- No, they're beautiful.
- I'm sorry.

849
01:04:57,856 --> 01:05:00,609
No, it's impressive.
They actually held together very well.

850
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:02,319
I'm gonna keep these.

851
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:04,530
You have your suit in there?

852
01:05:07,574 --> 01:05:09,243
My Suit?

853
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:11,787
It's for dinner. Are you gonna--?

854
01:05:11,954 --> 01:05:13,080
Are you gonna wear that?

855
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:14,248
- That's--
- Hey, hon.

856
01:05:19,878 --> 01:05:20,796
You must be Peter.

857
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:22,798
Dad, this is Peter.

858
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:26,677
Nice to meet you, sir.

859
01:05:27,886 --> 01:05:29,012
Nice to meet you.

860
01:05:29,179 --> 01:05:30,764
Dinner's ready.

861
01:05:31,557 --> 01:05:32,891
Hope you like branzino.

862
01:05:33,058 --> 01:05:34,601
Who doesn't?

863
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:35,454
<i>Emma, it's Curt.</i>

864
01:06:36,205 --> 01:06:38,415
<i>- Is he there?
- I'm afraid not, doctor.</i>

865
01:06:38,582 --> 01:06:41,418
<i>The car is taking him
to the Veterans Hospital in Brooklyn.</i>

866
01:06:41,585 --> 01:06:42,794
No. He can't, Emma.

867
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:45,255
You have to stop him. He--

868
01:06:45,422 --> 01:06:47,841
<i>I would, but I always lose him
on the bridge.</i>

869
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:50,969
<i>I'll make sure Dr. Ratha returns
your call as soon as possible.</i>

870
01:07:00,979 --> 01:07:04,316
I'm going to Holton Avenue,
across the river. I'm in a hurry.

871
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:06,527
You want me to take
the tunnel or the bridge?

872
01:07:06,693 --> 01:07:07,945
Bridge! Take the bridge.

873
01:07:08,111 --> 01:07:09,446
All right, we'll do that.

874
01:07:09,613 --> 01:07:10,697
Hey, you all right...

875
01:07:10,864 --> 01:07:11,615
...back there?

876
01:07:12,533 --> 01:07:13,200
You tweaking...

877
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:14,576
...man?

878
01:07:15,702 --> 01:07:17,329
Just drive.

879
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:19,122
Okay.

880
01:07:25,379 --> 01:07:26,880
You're having trouble there?

881
01:07:27,047 --> 01:07:28,715
The head goes on the other--

882
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:30,425
Help Gwen's friend with his fish.

883
01:07:30,592 --> 01:07:31,802
On, I...

884
01:07:31,969 --> 01:07:33,053
I got no idea.

885
01:07:33,220 --> 01:07:34,763
First time.

886
01:07:34,930 --> 01:07:36,515
- Branzino.
- George.

887
01:07:36,682 --> 01:07:39,434
- Tell us about your day.
- Did you catch that spider guy yet?

888
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:41,186
No, we didn't catch him yet.

889
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:43,230
But we will. He's an amateur...

890
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:46,108
...who's assaulting civilians
in the dead of night.

891
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,151
He's clumsy, he leaves clues...

892
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:49,695
...but he's still dangerous.

893
01:07:50,571 --> 01:07:52,030
He's assaulting people?

894
01:07:53,866 --> 01:07:54,867
I'm not sure.

895
01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:56,493
I mean, I saw that video...

896
01:07:56,660 --> 01:07:58,620
...with him and the car thief, and...

897
01:07:58,787 --> 01:08:01,915
I think most people
would say that he was...

898
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,042
...providing a public service.

899
01:08:04,751 --> 01:08:06,712
Most people would be wrong.

900
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:11,466
If I wanted the car thief off the street,
he'd already be off the street.

901
01:08:11,633 --> 01:08:12,885
So why wasn't he then?

902
01:08:16,889 --> 01:08:17,931
Let me illuminate you.

903
01:08:18,098 --> 01:08:20,726
The car thief was leading us
to the people who run...

904
01:08:20,893 --> 01:08:23,103
...the operation.
It's a six-month-long sting.

905
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:26,273
It's called strategy.
I'm sure you're aware of the term?

906
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,942
- You've heard about that in school?
- Yeah.

907
01:08:29,109 --> 01:08:29,985
Good.

908
01:08:30,152 --> 01:08:31,403
<i>I know.</i>

909
01:08:31,570 --> 01:08:34,239
- He didn't know you had a plan.
- You seem to know...

910
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:36,158
...a lot about this.
Know something we don't?

911
01:08:36,325 --> 01:08:38,619
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm not on anyone's side.

912
01:08:38,785 --> 01:08:40,162
I saw a video on the lnternet--

913
01:08:40,329 --> 01:08:41,872
You saw the video on the Internet.

914
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:44,249
- Well, then the case is closed.
- Well, no.

915
01:08:44,416 --> 01:08:45,375
If you watch the video--

916
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:47,002
Maybe send you a link?

917
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:48,837
It looks like he's trying to help.

918
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:51,882
On the Internet he's being made out
to look like a hero.

919
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:52,716
No, no.

920
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:54,593
I'm not saying he's a hero.

921
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,095
- What are you trying to say?
- He's trying to help.

922
01:08:57,262 --> 01:08:58,597
He's trying to do something
the police can't.

923
01:08:58,764 --> 01:09:00,140
Something the police can't?

924
01:09:00,307 --> 01:09:01,850
- I don't know.
- What do you think we do?

925
01:09:02,017 --> 01:09:03,560
Sit around eating doughnuts...

926
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:05,521
...with our thumbs
planted up our asses?

927
01:09:05,687 --> 01:09:07,731
- George. George.
- Daddy.

928
01:09:07,940 --> 01:09:08,649
- Up your what?
- Howard.

929
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:10,651
He stands for what you stand for.

930
01:09:10,817 --> 01:09:12,361
Protecting innocent people
from bad guys.

931
01:09:12,528 --> 01:09:14,613
I stand for law and order.
That's what I stand for.

932
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:16,365
Okay? I wear a badge.

933
01:09:16,532 --> 01:09:19,576
This guy wears a mask
like an outlaw.

934
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,287
He's hunting down criminals
that all look the same...

935
01:09:22,454 --> 01:09:24,623
...like he's got some sort
of personal vendetta.

936
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:27,793
But he's not protecting
innocent people, Mr. Parker.

937
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:29,795
Let's get some air, Peter.

938
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:32,589
- Dad, we need to talk.
- Yes, we do.

939
01:09:34,967 --> 01:09:36,802
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry...

940
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:39,221
...if I insulted you.
It was not my intention.

941
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:42,724
- You're welcome.
- Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.

942
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:44,977
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

943
01:09:46,687 --> 01:09:49,231
- Dad.
- Yeah?

944
01:09:55,988 --> 01:09:57,906
Well, that was something.

945
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:02,452
I'm sorry. I thought he was
going to arrest me at one point.

946
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:05,247
No, I wouldn't
have let him arrest you

947
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:12,713
- What happened to your face?
- I wanna tell you something.

948
01:10:14,590 --> 01:10:15,841
Okay.

949
01:10:20,971 --> 01:10:22,264
I've been bitten...

950
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,477
So have I.

951
01:10:32,941 --> 01:10:34,359
Okay.

952
01:10:35,861 --> 01:10:38,363
Okay, okay, okay.
I gotta tell you this one thing.

953
01:10:38,530 --> 01:10:40,282
I gotta tell you this thing about...

954
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:43,285
...the vigilante and the car thief.
- Oh, okay.

955
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,120
What?

956
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:47,539
- No, no, no.
- I don't want to talk about that.

957
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:49,374
Forget that.
I won't talk about that.

958
01:10:49,541 --> 01:10:51,793
- I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
- What about you?

959
01:10:51,960 --> 01:10:55,797
It's impo-- I wish I could just--

960
01:10:55,964 --> 01:10:57,216
I can't. It's hard to say.

961
01:10:57,382 --> 01:10:58,383
Just say it.

962
01:10:58,550 --> 01:11:00,677
- I don't know.
- Say it.

963
01:11:03,514 --> 01:11:04,806
What? What?

964
01:11:08,268 --> 01:11:09,978
What?

965
01:11:14,024 --> 01:11:15,901
Okay, then forget it.

966
01:11:24,034 --> 01:11:25,494
You...?

967
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:36,255
- You're Spider-Man.
- Shut up.

968
01:11:41,260 --> 01:11:42,761
Gwen?

969
01:11:44,012 --> 01:11:45,347
Gwen...

970
01:11:46,390 --> 01:11:48,308
Your father wants you to come inside.

971
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:49,935
Okay.

972
01:11:50,102 --> 01:11:51,103
- Okay?
- Yeah.

973
01:11:53,897 --> 01:11:54,940
Gwen.

974
01:11:55,065 --> 01:11:56,775
I'm coming.

975
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:30,058
Oh, I'm in trouble.

976
01:12:30,100 --> 01:12:30,517


977
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,458
Will you please...

978
01:12:54,583 --> 01:12:56,502
...find out what is going on, Alfred?

979
01:13:03,926 --> 01:13:04,801
Excellent.

980
01:13:08,096 --> 01:13:09,097
Hey!

981
01:13:11,892 --> 01:13:13,227
Hey! What is that?

982
01:13:13,352 --> 01:13:15,270
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know!

983
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:16,855
Get back in the car!

984
01:13:21,944 --> 01:13:23,320
Help!

985
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:25,906
Help!

986
01:14:06,029 --> 01:14:08,240
Incoming!

987
01:14:29,219 --> 01:14:29,928
Somebody help!

988
01:14:30,762 --> 01:14:32,431
Help me! My kid is trapped!

989
01:14:42,191 --> 01:14:43,358
I want my dad!

990
01:14:43,692 --> 01:14:44,735
Dad!

991
01:14:44,902 --> 01:14:46,278
'HeY,hey,hey
- Help!

992
01:14:46,445 --> 01:14:47,112
L-ley, buddy.

993
01:14:47,237 --> 01:14:48,447
- It's okay.
- Get away.

994
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:50,532
- Help!
- Hey, look.

995
01:14:52,075 --> 01:14:53,952
Just a normal guy, all right?

996
01:14:55,662 --> 01:14:56,538
Wanna hold this?

997
01:14:58,248 --> 01:14:59,041
Hold my mask.

998
01:14:59,625 --> 01:15:00,584
All right.

999
01:15:02,127 --> 01:15:03,587
What's your name?

1000
01:15:03,754 --> 01:15:04,546
Jack?

1001
01:15:05,464 --> 01:15:07,132
- Yes.
- Let's get you out of here.

1002
01:15:08,509 --> 01:15:10,260
Okay, stay very still.

1003
01:15:10,427 --> 01:15:11,261
All right.

1004
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:12,679
Okay, I got you.

1005
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:17,768
Okay, look.

1006
01:15:17,935 --> 01:15:19,561
I'll undo the belt. You hold on...

1007
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:21,772
...to that seat in front of you.
On three?

1008
01:15:22,022 --> 01:15:24,691
- All right.
- Okay, one, two, three.

1009
01:15:26,818 --> 01:15:28,987
See how easy that was?
You did a great job.

1010
01:15:29,154 --> 01:15:30,864
All right, okay.

1011
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:45,838
Jack, climb now.

1012
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,631
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

1013
01:15:53,011 --> 01:15:55,013
Put it on, the mask.

1014
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,598
It's gonna make you strong.

1015
01:15:57,182 --> 01:15:58,517
Jack, trust me.

1016
01:15:58,684 --> 01:15:59,643
Put it on.

1017
01:16:00,435 --> 01:16:03,063
There you go. That's it.
That's it, buddy.

1018
01:16:03,230 --> 01:16:04,356
Okay, now, climb.

1019
01:16:04,523 --> 01:16:05,524
Come on, Jack.

1020
01:16:09,278 --> 01:16:09,945
Do me a favour.

1021
01:16:10,112 --> 01:16:11,613
A little faster, okay, bud?

1022
01:16:11,864 --> 01:16:14,199
You're doing great, buddy.
You're doing great.

1023
01:16:14,366 --> 01:16:15,450
That's it. Keep coming.

1024
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:17,035
Keep it coming.

1025
01:16:17,202 --> 01:16:18,245
Keep coming.

1026
01:16:19,162 --> 01:16:20,497
No!

1027
01:16:35,137 --> 01:16:36,847
Jack. Oh, God.

1028
01:16:37,014 --> 01:16:38,515
Thank God.

1029
01:16:40,225 --> 01:16:41,560
You okay?

1030
01:16:44,605 --> 01:16:46,064
My son. My son.

1031
01:16:46,899 --> 01:16:48,025
Oh, my son.

1032
01:16:48,150 --> 01:16:49,943
My son.

1033
01:16:54,406 --> 01:16:55,490
Who are you?

1034
01:16:57,910 --> 01:16:59,411
Spider-Man.

1035
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,460
Beautiful.

1036
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:57,678
Settle down, guys.

1037
01:17:58,679 --> 01:18:00,305
Settle down, boys. Settle down.

1038
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:02,641
- Come on.
- Listen. At approximately...

1039
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:06,270
...9 p.m. last night, an incident
took place on the Williamsburg Bridge.

1040
01:18:06,812 --> 01:18:08,647
<i>Much of what occurred
is speculation...</i>

1041
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:11,608
<i>...at this point.
However, several eyewitnesses...</i>

1042
01:18:11,775 --> 01:18:15,195
<i>...to the crime, as well as
our own preliminary findings, have...</i>

1043
01:18:15,362 --> 01:18:16,488
<i>...positively placed...</i>

1044
01:18:16,655 --> 01:18:18,323
<i>...one individual at the scene.</i>

1045
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,950
<i>Which is why, this morning...</i>

1046
01:18:20,117 --> 01:18:21,535
<i>...I am issuing a warrant...</i>

1047
01:18:21,702 --> 01:18:25,038
<i>...for the masked vigilante
known as Spider-Man.</i>

1048
01:18:30,961 --> 01:18:34,673
<i>And lastly, city council members met
with homeowners and airport officials...</i>

1049
01:18:34,840 --> 01:18:36,508
<i>...in the first of four meetings...</i>

1050
01:18:43,807 --> 01:18:45,184
It's so beautiful.

1051
01:18:45,350 --> 01:18:47,186
Knows how to bite though.

1052
01:18:47,352 --> 01:18:49,104
Who else knows about this?

1053
01:18:49,271 --> 01:18:50,147
Just you.

1054
01:18:50,314 --> 01:18:51,565
Really?

1055
01:18:54,026 --> 01:18:55,944
Hey, you don't...

1056
01:18:56,695 --> 01:18:59,281
You don't believe what the police
are saying, do you?

1057
01:19:00,157 --> 01:19:01,658
Of course not.

1058
01:19:03,660 --> 01:19:05,037
Does it scare you?

1059
01:19:05,204 --> 01:19:07,039
What you can do?

1060
01:19:09,541 --> 01:19:10,876
No.

1061
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,086
No.

1062
01:19:14,046 --> 01:19:16,173
What did that thing
on the bridge look like?

1063
01:19:16,715 --> 01:19:19,176
It was real big.
Too big to be human.

1064
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,094
You gotta lay low.

1065
01:19:21,887 --> 01:19:23,263
No, can't do that.

1066
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:25,015
You've got to.

1067
01:19:25,849 --> 01:19:27,351
I mean, why...?

1068
01:19:27,643 --> 01:19:30,145
Because of last night.

1069
01:19:30,312 --> 01:19:32,314
Those people on the bridge.

1070
01:19:32,481 --> 01:19:36,485
Whatever was attacking them
would have killed them.

1071
01:19:38,111 --> 01:19:38,820
So...

1072
01:19:38,987 --> 01:19:40,656
...I gotta go after it.

1073
01:19:42,157 --> 01:19:43,200
That's not your job.

1074
01:19:44,618 --> 01:19:46,203
Maybe it is.

1075
01:19:51,124 --> 01:19:52,668
I really liked kissing you.

1076
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:56,797
You're an amazing kisser.

1077
01:19:59,591 --> 01:20:00,759
Well, you know, it was--

1078
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:02,928
It was good for me too.

1079
01:20:05,597 --> 01:20:07,224
Yeah?

1080
01:20:16,608 --> 01:20:17,776
Who did that?

1081
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:40,507
Hello!

1082
01:20:50,100 --> 01:20:52,352
It's not nice to snoop.

1083
01:20:55,230 --> 01:20:57,149
I gave everyone the week off.

1084
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:00,068
Yeah.

1085
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:02,654
Shouldn't you be at school?

1086
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,450
No, I got a free track.

1087
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:08,619
I wanted to ask you a question.

1088
01:21:09,328 --> 01:21:10,370
How would a predator...

1089
01:21:10,537 --> 01:21:11,830
...track a reptile?

1090
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:14,833
Oh, they don't.
Most reptiles are at the top...

1091
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,251
...of their food chain.

1092
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:17,920
Kings of their domain.

1093
01:21:18,086 --> 01:21:19,588
They gotta have vulnerabilities.

1094
01:21:19,755 --> 01:21:22,299
Why the sudden interest
in the cold-blooded?

1095
01:21:25,844 --> 01:21:27,137
Just asking a question.

1096
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:30,140
I got school stuff.

1097
01:21:30,307 --> 01:21:32,309
Biology profiles to do.

1098
01:21:32,726 --> 01:21:34,978
So because of the cold blood...

1099
01:21:35,145 --> 01:21:37,064
...would they react to changes
in temperatures?

1100
01:21:37,231 --> 01:21:38,607
You'd have to catch one first.

1101
01:21:39,525 --> 01:21:42,819
Did you know there's a rumour
of a new species in New York?

1102
01:21:42,986 --> 01:21:44,488
Beautiful and quite large.

1103
01:21:45,656 --> 01:21:47,616
What do you know about it?
You seen it?

1104
01:21:47,783 --> 01:21:49,785
No, it's not yet classified.

1105
01:21:52,746 --> 01:21:54,748
But it can be aggressive...

1106
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:56,583
...if threatened.

1107
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:05,592
Doc, you all right?

1108
01:22:05,759 --> 01:22:08,387
Never been better, Peter.
Never been better.

1109
01:22:08,554 --> 01:22:10,097
Now, if you'll excuse me.

1110
01:22:10,264 --> 01:22:13,016
Afraid I have to ask you to leave.
I have a new project...

1111
01:22:13,183 --> 01:22:15,602
...I'm working on.
I need to be alone.

1112
01:22:16,228 --> 01:22:18,522
Good. Good, good.

1113
01:22:19,064 --> 01:22:20,899
Good.

1114
01:22:21,483 --> 01:22:24,403
Don't worry, Mr. Parker.
I'll be back.

1115
01:22:25,404 --> 01:22:27,531
Wonderful things are coming.

1116
01:22:28,782 --> 01:22:30,576
Wonderful things.

1117
01:22:45,132 --> 01:22:46,425
Fred?

1118
01:22:51,221 --> 01:22:53,432
Mr. Mayor,
if there was a giant dinosaur...

1119
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,101
...running around
you would be the first to know.

1120
01:22:56,226 --> 01:22:58,812
So tell your son
he can rest easy, all right?

1121
01:22:58,979 --> 01:23:01,023
Yeah. You and me both, sir.

1122
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:03,400
Okay. Bye-bye-

1123
01:23:03,525 --> 01:23:05,444
Mr. Parker, why are you...

1124
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:07,446
...not in school?
- Got a free track.

1125
01:23:07,613 --> 01:23:08,864
Okay, well, I do not.

1126
01:23:09,031 --> 01:23:10,282
So make your point quickly.

1127
01:23:10,449 --> 01:23:12,826
Fine, there may not be a dinosaur
running around.

1128
01:23:12,951 --> 01:23:15,287
There is something more dangerous,
and I know who.

1129
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:17,039
- You know who?
- Dr. Curtis Connors.

1130
01:23:17,206 --> 01:23:18,582
- He's a biochemist.
- Of Oscorp?

1131
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,250
- That's right.
- Dr. Connors...

1132
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:22,419
...who's my daughter's mentor.
Is that who?

1133
01:23:22,586 --> 01:23:23,795
- That's the one.
- Okay.

1134
01:23:23,962 --> 01:23:27,257
Recently, Dr. Connors gave Gwen
a college recommendation.

1135
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:29,468
It was beautiful.
When I read it, I cried.

1136
01:23:29,593 --> 01:23:31,803
You would have me believe
that he...

1137
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:34,181
...is running around dressed up
like a dinosaur?

1138
01:23:34,348 --> 01:23:38,018
Not dressing up and not a dinosaur.
He has transformed himself into a lizard.

1139
01:23:41,271 --> 01:23:42,814
Let me ask you a question.

1140
01:23:42,981 --> 01:23:46,109
Do I look like the mayor
of Tokyo to you?

1141
01:23:46,235 --> 01:23:48,737
I'm telling you the absolute truth.

1142
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:51,949
This man has worked for his whole life
on cross-species genetics.

1143
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:55,661
He lost an arm, he tried to grow it back,
but the equation was imbalanced.

1144
01:23:55,827 --> 01:23:58,288
He has turned into a lizard.
He's using lizard DNA.

1145
01:23:58,455 --> 01:24:02,167
He is dangerous, and he is planning
something horrific. I know. I know.

1146
01:24:02,334 --> 01:24:04,795
Okay. All right, I get it.

1147
01:24:05,671 --> 01:24:06,713
Here's what we'll do.

1148
01:24:07,172 --> 01:24:09,967
You'll go back to hanging out
with the citizens of Tokyo.

1149
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:12,344
I'm gonna go back
to protecting the citizens...

1150
01:24:12,511 --> 01:24:14,555
...of this fine, fair city of ours.

1151
01:24:14,721 --> 01:24:16,974
Sergeant Butler,
please escort Mr. Parker...

1152
01:24:17,140 --> 01:24:20,102
...back to school.
- Captain Stacy, I'm not messing around.

1153
01:24:20,269 --> 01:24:23,313
Just bring him in. Just call him in.
You have to call him in.

1154
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:25,107
He is a danger to everybody.

1155
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:27,526
- Just, please, listen to me.
- Let's go.

1156
01:24:31,864 --> 01:24:33,198
Jimmy.

1157
01:24:34,408 --> 01:24:37,286
Get me everything we have
on Dr. Curtis Connors.

1158
01:24:37,411 --> 01:24:39,997
- Okay? Right away.
- Yeah.

1159
01:24:40,038 --> 01:24:40,455


1160
01:25:05,397 --> 01:25:07,357
Subject: Dr. Curtis Connors.

1161
01:25:07,524 --> 01:25:09,067
Current temperature: 89.7.

1162
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:10,694
Steady for 48 hours.

1163
01:25:10,861 --> 01:25:13,363
Blood panels reveal
lymphocyte and monocyte readings...

1164
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,199
...consistent with subject's past.

1165
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,623
Clotting rate vastly improved.

1166
01:25:22,789 --> 01:25:24,291
Marked enhancement...

1167
01:25:24,458 --> 01:25:25,792
...in muscle response...

1168
01:25:25,959 --> 01:25:27,336
...strength and elasticity.

1169
01:25:35,177 --> 01:25:37,262
Eyesight similarly improved.

1170
01:25:37,429 --> 01:25:39,932
Subject no longer requires
corrective lenses.

1171
01:25:45,270 --> 01:25:47,189
This is no longer about curing ills.

1172
01:25:47,731 --> 01:25:49,107
This is about...

1173
01:25:49,233 --> 01:25:50,359
...finding perfection.

1174
01:25:59,618 --> 01:26:01,703
In attempt to redress
regenerative relapse...

1175
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:05,624
...dosage has been increased
to 200 milligrams.

1176
01:27:40,427 --> 01:27:42,179
You stopped me once.

1177
01:27:43,013 --> 01:27:45,390
You won't stop me again.

1178
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:50,395
I'm getting stronger every day!

1179
01:28:29,142 --> 01:28:30,686
Oh, that sucked.

1180
01:28:42,114 --> 01:28:43,782
Peter Parker.

1181
01:29:01,466 --> 01:29:03,010
Come in.

1182
01:29:05,470 --> 01:29:06,805
You should maybe...

1183
01:29:06,972 --> 01:29:08,807
...consider coming in
through the lobby.

1184
01:29:10,434 --> 01:29:13,478
Also, my father is under
the impression...

1185
01:29:13,604 --> 01:29:16,481
...that you require psychiatric attention.
- Oh, really?

1186
01:29:16,732 --> 01:29:18,317
Peter.

1187
01:29:18,817 --> 01:29:19,860
What happened?

1188
01:29:19,985 --> 01:29:21,361
You should see the other guy.

1189
01:29:23,197 --> 01:29:27,618
The other guy, in this instance,
being a giant mutant lizard.

1190
01:29:27,784 --> 01:29:28,785
Hey, Gwen, honey.

1191
01:29:28,952 --> 01:29:29,870
Do you want cocoa?

1192
01:29:30,037 --> 01:29:31,163
Howard's making some.

1193
01:29:35,751 --> 01:29:37,169
No, Dad, I do not want cocoa.

1194
01:29:37,336 --> 01:29:39,004
Honestly, I'm 17 years old.

1195
01:29:39,171 --> 01:29:40,005
Okay.

1196
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:44,218
I remembered somebody saying her
fantasy was to live in a chocolate house.

1197
01:29:44,384 --> 01:29:45,844
Well, that's impractical.

1198
01:29:45,969 --> 01:29:47,429
And fattening.

1199
01:29:50,682 --> 01:29:51,767
Chocolate house.

1200
01:29:54,645 --> 01:29:56,438
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's good.

1201
01:29:56,605 --> 01:29:59,399
I can't have cocoa right now
because I'm work--

1202
01:29:59,525 --> 01:30:02,653
I'm doing this...

1203
01:30:02,819 --> 01:30:04,446
I have cramps.

1204
01:30:05,322 --> 01:30:07,366
I feel kind of pukey and just sort of...

1205
01:30:07,533 --> 01:30:09,826
- Like, emotional. I keep crying.
- It's okay. Good.

1206
01:30:09,952 --> 01:30:11,703
- Good.
- It's brutal.

1207
01:30:12,579 --> 01:30:13,914
You don't want to know.

1208
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:15,249
- It's, like, bad.
- Got it.

1209
01:30:15,415 --> 01:30:17,376
- Thanks, Daddy.
- All right.

1210
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:44,903
Easy, Bug BOY

1211
01:30:45,654 --> 01:30:47,072
What'd you call me?

1212
01:30:52,160 --> 01:30:53,996
I'm going to be all right.

1213
01:30:54,162 --> 01:30:56,874
- No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

1214
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,752
I know what this is.

1215
01:31:00,919 --> 01:31:02,254
What is it?

1216
01:31:03,172 --> 01:31:06,341
Every day, for as long
as I can remember, my father...

1217
01:31:06,508 --> 01:31:07,968
...has left every morning...

1218
01:31:08,135 --> 01:31:10,804
...and he's put a badge on his chest...

1219
01:31:10,971 --> 01:31:13,265
...and strapped a gun to his hip.

1220
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:18,312
And every day,
for as long as I can remember...

1221
01:31:18,478 --> 01:31:20,939
...I haven't known if he was
gonna make it home.

1222
01:31:30,490 --> 01:31:32,326
<i>L</i> 901 you

1223
01:31:33,577 --> 01:31:34,745
Okay?

1224
01:31:37,456 --> 01:31:38,457
Okay?

1225
01:31:40,042 --> 01:31:42,127
I gotta stop him, though.

1226
01:31:42,794 --> 01:31:45,714
I have to, because I created him.

1227
01:31:49,009 --> 01:31:50,469
What do you mean?

1228
01:31:51,887 --> 01:31:53,972
I gave him an equation...

1229
01:31:56,517 --> 01:31:58,644
...that made all of this possible.

1230
01:32:06,276 --> 01:32:09,154
Something my father
had been working on, you know.

1231
01:32:09,321 --> 01:32:12,324
Secretly. Now I realise
why he kept it a secret.

1232
01:32:15,118 --> 01:32:17,579
Point is, this is my responsibility.

1233
01:32:20,916 --> 01:32:23,085
I have to fix it.

1234
01:32:26,171 --> 01:32:27,840
Peter.

1235
01:32:28,882 --> 01:32:30,592
Hey.

1236
01:32:33,887 --> 01:32:36,014
Let's get out of here.

1237
01:32:36,181 --> 01:32:37,975
Let's just get out of here.

1238
01:32:38,141 --> 01:32:39,852
Just for a minute. Can we?

1239
01:32:40,561 --> 01:32:42,521
- No. No.
- Yeah. Yes.

1240
01:32:42,688 --> 01:32:43,856
- Yes.
- No.

1241
01:32:44,022 --> 01:32:45,190
Yes.

1242
01:32:45,357 --> 01:32:47,860
If my parents see me leaving,
I'm dead.

1243
01:32:52,447 --> 01:32:54,533
Your parents aren't
gonna see you leaving.

<i>...humanity on an evolutionary scale.</i>

Go. Go!

1264
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:07,541
Nowhere to hide, Peter.

1265
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,101
All these souls...

1266
01:35:26,268 --> 01:35:27,519
...lost and alone.

1267
01:35:27,686 --> 01:35:28,562
I can save them.

1268
01:35:28,729 --> 01:35:30,355
I can cure them.

1269
01:35:30,522 --> 01:35:32,107
There's no need to stop me...

1270
01:35:32,274 --> 01:35:33,192
...Peter.

1271
01:35:42,743 --> 01:35:44,828
You're not thinking straight, doc.

1272
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:50,167
Stop this. This isn't you.

1273
01:35:55,339 --> 01:35:56,298
Let's talk this out.

1274
01:35:57,424 --> 01:35:58,175
Doc!

1275
01:36:04,264 --> 01:36:05,307
Oh, boy.

1276
01:36:10,896 --> 01:36:11,939
You don't want to talk?

1277
01:36:12,773 --> 01:36:14,316
There you go.

1278
01:36:17,945 --> 01:36:19,154
Don't...

1279
01:36:19,947 --> 01:36:21,532

...hurt you!

1282
01:36:32,042 --> 01:36:33,377
That is disgusting.

1283
01:36:43,428 --> 01:36:44,805
Gwen.

1284
01:37:08,745 --> 01:37:10,956
- I'm gonna throw you out the window.
- What?

1285
01:37:24,178 --> 01:37:25,220
Somebody's been...

1286
01:37:25,387 --> 01:37:27,055
...a bad lizard.

1287
01:38:13,936 --> 01:38:16,021
This is Lieutenant Williams
from the New York City...

1288
01:38:16,188 --> 01:38:19,650
...Police Department.
We've got this building surrounded.

1289

Alpha, let's move ahead. Go!

1290
01:38:42,464 --> 01:38:43,757
- Hey.
- Where are you?

1291
01:38:43,924 --> 01:38:44,842
I'm fine. I'm okay.

1292
01:38:45,008 --> 01:38:48,387
I'm in the sewer, tracking him. I gotta
stop him before anyone gets hurt.

1293
01:38:48,554 --> 01:38:49,680
But we need an antidote.

1294

Okay, I need you to go to Oscorp.

1300
01:39:35,142 --> 01:39:38,770

01:39:54,369 --> 01:39:55,204
<i>...much more?</i>

1309
01:39:55,370 --> 01:39:57,664
<i>Faster. Stronger.</i>

1310
01:39:57,831 --> 01:39:59,249
<i>Smarter.</i>

1311
01:39:59,416 --> 01:40:02,252
<i>This is my gift to you.</i>

1312
01:40:10,761 --> 01:40:12,429
Oscorp.

1313
01:40:14,681 --> 01:40:15,807
- Captain Stacy!
- What?

1314
01:40:15,974 --> 01:40:18,435
We have a confirmed sighting, sir.
The Lizard's headed...

1315
01:40:18,602 --> 01:40:20,812
...toward Canal Street.
- What about Spider-Man?

1316
01:40:20,979 --> 01:40:22,189
Inside the high school.

1317
01:40:22,356 --> 01:40:24,274
I want that Spider-Man off the street.

1318
01:42:10,881 --> 01:42:13,759
<i>The lizard creature
has released a biological agent.</i>

1319
01:42:13,926 --> 01:42:15,719
<i>All efforts to stop him have failed...</i>

1320
01:42:15,886 --> 01:42:19,097
<i>...and he is now proceeding
north on 7th Avenue. Over.</i>

1321
01:42:23,101 --> 01:42:23,977
- Hi.
- Where are you?

1322
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:25,437
<i>Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp.</i>

1323
01:42:25,604 --> 01:42:27,356
You have to get out of there now.

1324
01:42:27,523 --> 01:42:29,900
- The antidote is cooking.
- No, no, no.

1325
01:42:30,067 --> 01:42:32,528
<i>Connors is on the way.
He's coming to you right now.</i>

1326
01:42:32,694 --> 01:42:35,239
He needs the device.
He's gonna infect the whole city!

1327
01:42:35,405 --> 01:42:36,573
Eight minutes left.

1328
01:42:36,740 --> 01:42:39,284
<i>You're gonna wait eight minutes
after what I told you?</i>

1329
01:42:39,451 --> 01:42:40,786
You leave right now.

1330
01:42:40,953 --> 01:42:41,995
<i>That is an order, okay?</i>

1331
01:42:42,162 --> 01:42:43,247
I'll get everybody out.

1332
01:42:43,413 --> 01:42:44,915
<i>Did you hear wh--?</i>

1333
01:42:45,082 --> 01:42:48,126
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard.
Are you serious?

1334
01:43:04,643 --> 01:43:05,811
He's heading south.

1335
01:43:16,572 --> 01:43:18,574
Stand down now, or we will open fire.

1336
01:43:18,740 --> 01:43:20,492
You are surrounded. There is...

1337
01:43:20,659 --> 01:43:21,994
...l"IO BSCBPB

1338
01:43:22,452 --> 01:43:23,871
Go, go!

1339
01:44:25,807 --> 01:44:27,184
Clear!

1340
01:44:27,351 --> 01:44:28,477
Clear up top!

1341
01:44:30,312 --> 01:44:31,563
Clear, sir!

1342
01:44:31,730 --> 01:44:32,898
All clear here, sir!

1343
01:44:58,382 --> 01:44:59,925
Freeze!

1344
01:45:00,592 --> 01:45:01,760
Down on the ground.

1345
01:45:01,927 --> 01:45:03,387
Your hands behind your head.

1346
01:45:03,554 --> 01:45:05,180
Now!

1347
01:45:08,559 --> 01:45:10,018
Parker.

1348
01:45:11,895 --> 01:45:12,896
It's headed to Oscorp!

1349
01:45:13,063 --> 01:45:15,440
And your daughter's there right now.

1350
01:45:28,203 --> 01:45:29,496
You gotta let me go.

1351
01:45:44,094 --> 01:45:44,845
Hold your fire!

1352
01:45:51,935 --> 01:45:54,438
Well, Paul, if I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

1353
01:45:54,605 --> 01:45:57,024
I won't venture to say
what it is crawling up...

1354
01:45:57,191 --> 01:45:59,109
...the north side
of the Oscorp Tower...

1355
01:45:59,276 --> 01:46:02,529
...but clearly it is not human
and it is very, very strong.

1356

<i>Time remaining: one minute.</i>

<i>We're getting the latest details.
This is just coming in.</i>

1360

<i>The New York Police Department...</i>

1361

<i>...has called for

<i>...everything south of 54th Street.</i>

1363

<i>If you are south of 54th Street...</i>

1364
01:48:02,191 --> 01:48:04,651
<i>...you have to move out
of the area immediately.</i>

1365
01:48:14,119 --> 01:48:16,705
<i>Spider-Man appears
to be heading towards Oscorp.</i>

1366
01:48:16,872 --> 01:48:17,915
<i>He looks injured...</i>

1367
01:48:18,081 --> 01:48:20,751
<i>...and it's really not clear
if he's gonna make it.</i>

1368
01:48:20,918 --> 01:48:22,002
<i>That's the guy who...</i>

1369
01:48:22,169 --> 01:48:23,545
...saved my boy on the bridge.

1370
01:48:23,712 --> 01:48:25,088
Troy, they're clearing us out.

1371
01:48:25,255 --> 01:48:27,674
Something bad's
going down in Midtown.

1372
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:30,427
Still friends with Matthews,
that crane operator on 6th?

1373
01:48:30,594 --> 01:48:32,513
- Yeah.
- Get him on the phone for me.

1374
01:48:32,679 --> 01:48:34,765
The cops are evacuating everybody.

1375
01:48:34,932 --> 01:48:37,142
Get him on the phone for me.

1376
01:48:54,743 --> 01:48:57,371
Hey, Charlie, get me Enrique:
on 54th Street!

1377
01:48:57,538 --> 01:48:59,623
- You got it.
- Angelo, get your mug over here.

1378
01:48:59,790 --> 01:49:02,125
Wolski! You're getting some overtime!

1379
01:49:03,502 --> 01:49:05,462
<i>All tower cranes on 6th...</i>

1380
01:49:05,629 --> 01:49:09,341
swing your jib arms over the avenue
Boom angles at 90 degrees.

1381

<i>Let's give him a clear approach. Over.</i>

1383

Come on, Parker.

1384
01:51:45,205 --> 01:51:45,914
Hey.

1385
01:51:46,206 --> 01:51:47,291
Dad!

1386
01:51:47,457 --> 01:51:49,626
- I have to get this to Spider-Man.
- Get in.

1387
01:51:49,793 --> 01:51:51,628
- It can stop the Lizard.
- Get in the car.

1388
01:51:51,795 --> 01:51:54,673
- You don't understand!
- Yes, I do.

1389
01:51:54,840 --> 01:51:57,092
Your boyfriend
is a man of many masks.

1390
01:51:57,259 --> 01:51:58,427
I get it.

1391
01:51:58,594 --> 01:51:59,678

01:53:51,999 --> 01:53:55,794
No mother, no father...

1398

...no uncle.

1399

All alone.

1400
01:54:02,968 --> 01:54:03,969
He's not alone.

<i>Detonation in T-minus 45 seconds.</i>

Look at me. Stay with me.

- Help's on the way, okay?
- You need to...

1430
01:57:31,260 --> 01:57:34,763
You need to be gone

You're gonna make enemies.

So I want you to promise me
something, okay?

1441
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:13,677
Leave Gwen out of it.

...rifles and they made speeches.

Two of my teachers showed up.

1467

02:02:25,429 --> 02:02:28,056
Everyone was there but you.

1469
02:02:42,654 --> 02:02:44,781
Can't do this. Can't do this.

1470
02:02:47,034 --> 02:02:49,077
I'm sorry. I can't...

1471
02:02:49,244 --> 02:02:50,662
What are you saying?

1472
02:02:50,829 --> 02:02:52,664
I can't see you any more.

1473
02:02:54,625 --> 02:02:56,084
I can't.

1474
02:03:21,693 --> 02:03:23,695
He made you promise, didn't he?

1475
02:03:27,699 --> 02:03:31,578
To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.

1476
02:03:58,063 --> 02:03:58,897
What a pretty...

1477
02:03:59,064 --> 02:03:59,940
...girl.

1478
02:04:00,107 --> 02:04:01,275
Yeah.

1479
02:04:01,441 --> 02:04:03,235
That's what Uncle Ben said.

1480
02:04:04,278 --> 02:04:05,946
Did you ask her out?

1481
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:11,034
Why?

1482
02:04:12,119 --> 02:04:13,579
Can't.

1483
02:04:14,872 --> 02:04:16,248
Why?

1484
02:04:18,834 --> 02:04:20,544
I'm just no good for her.

1485
02:04:23,714 --> 02:04:27,176
Peter Parker, if there's
one thing you are, it's good.

1486
02:04:28,218 --> 02:04:29,386
Anyone has a problem...

1487
02:04:29,553 --> 02:04:31,263
...with that can talk to me.

1488
02:04:48,989 --> 02:04:52,034
<i>Peter, I know things have been...</i>

1489
02:04:52,201 --> 02:04:53,410
<i>...difficult lately...</i>

1490
02:04:53,577 --> 02:04:55,662
<i>...and I'm sorry about that.</i>

1491
02:04:56,079 --> 02:04:59,041
<i>I think I know what you're feeling.</i>

1492
02:04:59,208 --> 02:05:01,793
<i>Ever since you were a little boy...</i>

1493
02:05:01,960 --> 02:05:06,381
<i>...you've been living with
so many unresolved things.</i>

1494
02:05:07,591 --> 02:05:09,885
<i>Well, take it from an old man:</i>

1495
02:05:10,469 --> 02:05:13,555
<i>Those things send us
down a road.</i>

1496
02:05:13,722 --> 02:05:14,806
<i>They make us...</i>

1497
02:05:14,973 --> 02:05:16,058
<i>...who we are.</i>

1498
02:05:16,308 --> 02:05:21,563
<i>And if anyone's destined for greatness,
it's you, son.</i>

1499
02:05:22,147 --> 02:05:24,566
<i>You owe the world your gifts.</i>

1500
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:28,028
<i>You just have to figure out
how to use them.</i>

1501
02:05:28,570 --> 02:05:31,907
<i>And know that wherever
they take you...</i>

1502
02:05:32,074 --> 02:05:34,368
<i>...we'll always be here.</i>

1503
02:05:35,202 --> 02:05:37,788
<i>So come on home, Peter.</i>

1504
02:05:38,664 --> 02:05:40,499
<i>You're my hero.</i>

1505
02:05:40,666 --> 02:05:42,167
<i>And I love you.</i>

1506
02:05:50,592 --> 02:05:52,302
- What's up, Parker?
- What's up?

1507
02:05:52,469 --> 02:05:53,929
Hey. How's it going?

1508
02:05:54,888 --> 02:05:56,265
You coming along, man?

1509
02:05:57,850 --> 02:05:58,684
Cool shirt.

1510
02:06:00,561 --> 02:06:01,687
Yeah.

1511
02:06:01,854 --> 02:06:03,355
Dude's crazy.

1512
02:06:03,522 --> 02:06:04,898
But chicks dig him.

1513
02:06:07,693 --> 02:06:10,404
Come on, guys, you heard the bell.
Get to class.

1514
02:06:19,872 --> 02:06:22,749
<i>I had a professor once
who liked to tell his students...</i>

1515
02:06:22,916 --> 02:06:26,170
...that there were only 10 different plots
in all of fiction.

1516
02:06:27,129 --> 02:06:29,214
Well, I'm here to tell you
he was wrong.

1517
02:06:29,381 --> 02:06:30,799
There is only one:

1518
02:06:31,717 --> 02:06:33,218
"Who am I"?

1519
02:06:33,927 --> 02:06:35,846
Mr. Parker.

1520
02:06:36,013 --> 02:06:37,014
Tardy again.

1521
02:06:38,974 --> 02:06:40,809
At least we can always count on you.

1522
02:06:40,976 --> 02:06:43,729
Sorry, Miss Ritter,
won't happen again, I promise.

1523
02:06:43,896 --> 02:06:45,981
Don't make promises you can't keep.

1524
02:06:48,233 --> 02:06:50,402
Yeah, but those are the best kind.

1525
02:06:50,569 --> 02:06:52,404
Okay, class, open your books.

1526
02:06:52,571 --> 02:06:54,573
Let's begin on page one.

1527
02:09:49,831 --> 02:09:52,417
Hello, doctor.

1528
02:09:52,584 --> 02:09:53,919
Did you tell the boy?

1529
02:09:54,086 --> 02:09:55,128
Tell him what?

1530
02:09:55,295 --> 02:09:59,049
Did you tell the boy
the truth about his father?

1531
02:10:00,717 --> 02:10:01,593
No.

1532
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,345
Well, that's very good.

1533
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:04,763
So we'll let him be...

1534
02:10:04,930 --> 02:10:05,889
...for now.

1535
02:10:06,932 --> 02:10:09,017
You should leave him alone!
