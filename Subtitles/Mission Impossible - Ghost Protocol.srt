1
00:03:39,036 --> 00:03:42,147
Let's give you a few friends to play with.

2
00:03:55,036 --> 00:03:56,922
Sorry.

3
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:14,012
Okay, I'm set. How is things going down below?

4
00:04:14,047 --> 00:04:15,782
How do you think? I am in a sewer.

5
00:04:33,845 --> 00:04:35,897
Damn!

6
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:49,032
I'm in position.

7
00:04:49,434 --> 00:04:51,592
Move to phase two.

8
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,070
Wha,what are you doing? What are you doing?

9
00:05:46,105 --> 00:05:48,015
What's wrong? What's happening, Benji?

10
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,676
O God! He is not gonna be in the extraction point.

11
00:05:49,776 --> 00:05:52,976
Stay focus. He knows where he's going.

12
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:03,060
No,  no, I'm not. No, I wouldn't, I would not open that door, please.

13
00:06:03,251 --> 00:06:05,078
Go to the  extraction point, Ethan.

14
00:06:05,113 --> 00:06:09,156
I know, I know what this means, but I, I can't. I'm not authorized...

15
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,462
Go to the extraction point, Ethan. Go to the extraction point!

16
00:06:14,172 --> 00:06:17,694
O, we gonna, each we gonna wait, we gonna wait ,we gonna wait. Right, I can wait.

17
00:06:27,925 --> 00:06:30,261
Okay fine! fine! fine!

18
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,754
There! You just, just screw the whole thing up, on purposed.

19
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:43,370
ah..Jane, we gonna have a slight delay.

20
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,778
Why do you wanna go in there?

21
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,906
I don't know what he's doing, and for some reasons I'm helping him

22
00:07:26,941 --> 00:07:29,838
As long as he's in his ways should be in the song end

23
00:07:33,976 --> 00:07:36,220
ah, we have a passenger.

24
00:08:02,378 --> 00:08:04,254
Sergei!

25
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,166
Open all!

26
00:08:29,981 --> 00:08:31,433
Come on!

27
00:09:21,351 --> 00:09:22,488
Go ahead.

28
00:09:22,523 --> 00:09:25,411
- Agent Hunt?
- And you're?

29
00:09:25,485 --> 00:09:27,550
Agent Carter.

30
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,449
Okay.

31
00:09:30,076 --> 00:09:32,595
- Who's your pal?
- I tell you on the way.

32
00:09:36,697 --> 00:09:38,861
Light the fuse!

33
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:05,285
Mission Impossible 4:  GHOST PROTOCOL

35
00:11:37,418 --> 00:11:40,660
- Sergei, what happens here?
- Everything is fine, Bogdan.

36
00:11:40,695 --> 00:11:43,902
I don't mean to bring up elephant in the room, but what's the big hairy Russian?

37
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:44,915
Who, Bogdan?

38
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,374
He said me intel. If I left him there, they would kill him.

39
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:50,083
So we're gonna give him his freedom. Did you call these sweepers?

40
00:11:50,118 --> 00:11:52,485
- Yeah, they're on their way
- Good, good.

41
00:11:54,691 --> 00:11:57,115
Benji, how is it you're here?

42
00:11:57,553 --> 00:12:00,970
Oh, I passed a few exam. Crazy, right?

43
00:12:01,772 --> 00:12:03,428
Yeah, it's crazy.

44
00:12:03,463 --> 00:12:04,918
- DNA test.
- It's me.

45
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,726
It's procedure. I'm just confirming it's you.

46
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:08,581
You're very thorough.

47
00:12:08,616 --> 00:12:10,401
Sergei, are you not Russian?

48
00:12:10,436 --> 00:12:13,980
- Yes perhaps.
- Sweeps are approaching, brooms are edged.

49
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,164
- Roger that.

50
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,731
Sergei, are you not Sergei?

51
00:12:24,145 --> 00:12:27,102
You'll be fine. Bogdan ...

52
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:30,308
- I always take care of my friends.
- My friend ...

53
00:12:36,852 --> 00:12:39,948
- Messy bringing him along?
- I thought it went rather well.

54
00:12:39,983 --> 00:12:42,175
You want telling me what are you doing in Russian prison?

55
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,661
Wanna tell me why you brought me up?

56
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:47,420
This wasn't a rescue mission?

57
00:12:47,455 --> 00:12:49,279
Let me put it this way...

58
00:12:49,314 --> 00:12:52,128
If The Secretary wanted me out of there,

59
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:55,578
must be pretty bad out here.

60
00:12:58,233 --> 00:13:01,626
We were after a file. We lost it.

61
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,415
We? Who lost it, you?

62
00:13:09,641 --> 00:13:12,840
- Agent Hanaway.
- Where is Hanaway?

63
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,832
<i>It was a little drop

64
00:13:25,284 --> 00:13:27,097
<i>... classified file.

65
00:13:27,402 --> 00:13:29,825
<i>It should've been a simple intercept.

66
00:13:37,918 --> 00:13:39,904
<i>They knew, which train the courier was on.</i>

67
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:41,781
ETA 2 minutes on the courier.

68
00:13:41,816 --> 00:13:44,767
<i>- But there is one thing we didn't know.</i>
- Wild Cat.

69
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:45,768
your train six minutes at.

70
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,034
<i>Who the courier was.</i>

71
00:14:00,846 --> 00:14:02,639
Now or never, Bob Cat.

72
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:05,733
Hurry! Who's delivering the file, what's his name?

73
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:09,761
- Go ahead, shoot.
- We're out of time.

74
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:19,563
I need a name, folks. You can't track all these people at once.

75
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:23,924
Aargh, Marek..Stefanski. For the love of God..

76
00:14:24,271 --> 00:14:26,957
- You got it?
- Marek Stefanski.

77
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:32,094
Searching...

78
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:46,263
I'll take it from here.

79
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:57,445
Are you allright, buddy?

80
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,636
Hanaway dropped Marek, and grab his bag.

81
00:14:59,637 --> 00:15:03,384
Sit down. Get your breath.

82
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:07,508
He had the file in his in hands. Easy in easy out.

83
00:15:07,543 --> 00:15:09,946
file's secured.

84
00:15:10,244 --> 00:15:13,044
But we weren't the only ones after it.

85
00:15:13,265 --> 00:15:16,147
Bob Cap, someone else is scratched this party.

86
00:15:17,979 --> 00:15:20,423
I'm not alone.

87
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,201
- Local police?
- No. Armed hostils.

88
00:15:30,918 --> 00:15:34,265
Maintain, I'm coming. I will get him backing up.

89
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:37,923
Negative, Operator. Broad the route southwest corner, 60 seconds.

90
00:15:40,104 --> 00:15:42,931
Hanaway's lens came to a facial matched...
and triggered a warning.

91
00:15:46,596 --> 00:15:49,037
But it was too late.

92
00:15:54,947 --> 00:15:56,701
No!

93
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:03,294
You're gonna be okay.

94
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,925
You're so beautiful.

95
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:13,330
I should've told you..

96
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:19,724
It was my op.

97
00:16:20,656 --> 00:16:23,147
I put him in the field.

98
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,254
And she left him just alive enough for me to see him die.

99
00:16:44,063 --> 00:16:46,596
I'm sorry.

100
00:16:48,636 --> 00:16:52,705
- You know her?
- Sabine Moreau. Contract killer.

101
00:16:53,664 --> 00:16:56,036
Works for diamonds.

102
00:16:56,696 --> 00:16:58,786
Who is in the file?

103
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:09,342
Russian nuclear launch codes.

104
00:17:15,989 --> 00:17:19,763
IMF's been looking for emerging extremist, codenamed Cobalt .

105
00:17:19,798 --> 00:17:22,996
He's determined to detonate a nuclear weapon however he can.

106
00:17:23,031 --> 00:17:25,166
We know Moreau works for him before.

107
00:17:25,382 --> 00:17:28,200
What else did IMF know about him?

108
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,209
As much as you do now.

109
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,087
But if Moreau has nuclear launch codes,

110
00:17:32,088 --> 00:17:37,161
you can bet Cobalt's confirmed person of interest to enemy number one .

111
00:17:37,197 --> 00:17:39,616
We're here.

112
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:05,513
- Agent confirmed.
- Why was he in prison?

113
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:10,276
He disobeyed. After he and his wife ... you know.

114
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:14,562
I thought he just been transferred. Or on leave.

115
00:18:15,342 --> 00:18:17,564
There were rumours then...

116
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:19,341
to work on the unsanctioned hit.

117
00:18:19,376 --> 00:18:21,049
<i>Welcome back, Mr. Hunt.

118
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:24,347
<i>In your absence, IMF has learnt that Cobalt is, or was,

119
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:27,611
<i>a level one nuclear strategist for Russian Intelligent.

120
00:18:27,612 --> 00:18:30,670
<i>Therefore, the only way to uncover his actual identity

121
00:18:30,705 --> 00:18:33,531
<i>is to infiltrate the Kremlin itself.

122
00:18:33,676 --> 00:18:35,116
<i>In order to get passed their checkpoints,

123
00:18:35,151 --> 00:18:38,181
<i>you'll be impersonating General Anatoly Fedorov.

124
00:18:38,182 --> 00:18:42,060
<i>We believe Cobalt will do everything he can to destroy any record of his identity.

125
00:18:42,345 --> 00:18:44,672
<i>Your mission, should you choose to accept it,

126
00:18:44,707 --> 00:18:47,855
<i>is to penetrate the highly secured archive inside the Kremlin.

127
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:50,427
<i>And retrieve Cobalt's file, before he can destroy it.

128
00:18:50,772 --> 00:18:53,605
<i>New intel suggests Cobalt is already in route,

129
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:56,937
<i>leaving you... 4 hours 52 minutes

130
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:58,471
<i>to infiltrate.

131
00:18:58,506 --> 00:19:01,196
<i>To save time, we've chosen your team for you.

132
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:04,229
Agent Carter and Dunn.

133
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:10,163
<i>As always, should you or any member of your team, be caught or killed.

134
00:19:10,198 --> 00:19:12,948
<i>The Secretary will disavow any knowledge of your actions.

135
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:16,952
<i>This message will self-destruct in 5 seconds.
Good luck, Ethan.</i>

136
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,364
What do you got?

137
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:49,299
We're going into the Kremlin.

138
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:53,826
I thought you said "the Kremlin".

139
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,529
I thought you said "the Kremlin".

140
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,211
Okay.

141
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,683
This is very exciting.

142
00:20:41,081 --> 00:20:44,289
Being on the field ... with you, you know.

143
00:20:44,939 --> 00:20:47,527
It's a bit of a dream ... for me.

144
00:20:49,105 --> 00:20:52,196
I love your disguise by the way. You look just like him.

145
00:20:53,514 --> 00:20:57,292
It's a shame would wear a masks. You know like a full masks.

146
00:20:58,137 --> 00:21:00,823
Everybody get to wear a mask, but Benji.

147
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:04,769
Sorry. I'm dead. I babbled when I am nervous.

148
00:21:04,804 --> 00:21:07,322
When doing it again, shut up it.

149
00:21:20,754 --> 00:21:23,505
Okay, settle secure to go, that's x-ray machines, cameras...

150
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,256
metal detectors. Just what we expected.

151
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,032
We can do this.

152
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:35,685
Releasing in three, two, one.

153
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:44,810
Going fast, going fast, Kremlin going fast.

154
00:23:06,856 --> 00:23:08,455
I think might not going well.

155
00:23:08,902 --> 00:23:11,594
- Relax.
- Sorry.

156
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,073
I'm sorry, by the way ...

157
00:24:40,108 --> 00:24:42,267
About you and Julia.

158
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,853
You know ... not working if i may ...

159
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:50,659
I wanted to say something before you ran away but I,..I liked it.

160
00:24:51,178 --> 00:24:53,846
here, he's off the phone now.

161
00:28:29,883 --> 00:28:33,874
It's empty. The disks are empty.

162
00:28:48,797 --> 00:28:51,406
Check in, team leader.

163
00:28:51,471 --> 00:28:54,254
Over. Repeat, check in, team leader.

164
00:28:54,289 --> 00:28:56,023
Have you made it to the archive room?

165
00:28:56,058 --> 00:28:59,100
Captain, one is in the archive!

166
00:29:01,371 --> 00:29:03,648
Someone is pickybacking our frequency.

167
00:29:03,956 --> 00:29:08,851
Team leader, awaiting your go sign. Standing by to detonate.

168
00:29:09,082 --> 00:29:11,136
Abort!

169
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:15,570
Rendezvous nod 2.

170
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:19,948
What is it?

171
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,237
Close the gate!

172
00:30:38,681 --> 00:30:41,186
Immediately!

173
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,551
Our media is no more thruthful than yours ...

174
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:35,398
...American.

175
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,167
But we both know, that there'll cause of the explosion was you.

176
00:32:46,412 --> 00:32:51,638
Awaiting your go sign, Team leader. Standing by to detonate.

177
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:55,546
The worst part for you, team leader...

178
00:32:56,211 --> 00:33:02,886
is I'm the man assigned to make you suffer for it,
for what you did to my country.

179
00:34:39,474 --> 00:34:41,346
Not a good idea.

180
00:34:42,499 --> 00:34:44,837
Seem like one ... a minute ago.

181
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:41,538
All units, we have a fugitive. He took her to the west.

182
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,987
<i>Insolidated insurance. How may I help you?</i>

183
00:36:04,522 --> 00:36:07,811
Search 20. Agent A2 delta echo requesting immediate "evac".

184
00:36:07,902 --> 00:36:10,156
Rendezvous Alpha 1-1-3.

185
00:36:10,191 --> 00:36:14,084
<i>Confirmed. Alpha 1-1-3.</i>

186
00:36:48,269 --> 00:36:51,269
Anna, Anna, Anna.

187
00:36:51,502 --> 00:36:54,134
I told myself ...

188
00:37:00,274 --> 00:37:02,751
We should leave town for a couple of days.

189
00:37:02,786 --> 00:37:05,796
Alex, you, me. Vacation.

190
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:08,289
- Now?
- Tonight.

191
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:13,978
just, just the three of us.

192
00:37:20,485 --> 00:37:22,503
Where will we go?

193
00:37:26,407 --> 00:37:28,706
Leonid?

194
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:31,736
<i>(news) ...has been transported to anear hospital for treatment.

195
00:37:33,063 --> 00:37:34,807
<i>While Russian Officials continue to blame

196
00:37:34,808 --> 00:37:36,023

202
00:37:51,816 --> 00:37:54,806
Anna, pack a bag for Alex.

203
00:37:55,791 --> 00:37:58,342
We're leaving now.

204
00:37:58,598 --> 00:38:00,942
Anna.

205
00:38:01,556 --> 00:38:03,698
Anna.

206
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:17,799
We have work to do.

207
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:49,010
Mr. Secretary.

208
00:38:51,849 --> 00:38:53,474
There's in no way you're in Russia.

209
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:57,379
I'm not. Not since a bomb blew up the Kremlin.

210
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:06,162
Yesterday I flew in to accept the order of friendship from Russian Prime Minister.

211
00:39:06,276 --> 00:39:09,126
Now I'm headed back to Washington,

212
00:39:09,161 --> 00:39:11,977
to hand the President my resignation.

213
00:39:14,246 --> 00:39:17,518
My chief analyst, William Brandt.

214
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:21,348
- A pen
- Pardon me?
- A pen.

215
00:39:21,349 --> 00:39:22,400
Here.

216
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:28,086
Ethan, what happened in the Kremlin?

217
00:39:28,543 --> 00:39:30,080
Chief analyst you say?

218
00:39:30,115 --> 00:39:32,597
- I'm implying that I made about a call ...
- Europian male.

219
00:39:33,024 --> 00:39:37,513
Fifties, about 6 foots, 180 pounds, blue eyes. Who is he?

220
00:39:39,313 --> 00:39:41,553
Crude drawing, but by your description..

221
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:43,791
... that could be Kurt Hendricks.

222
00:39:43,892 --> 00:39:47,600
190 IQ, served in Swedish Special Forces.

223
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,948
Professor of Physics, Stockholm University

224
00:39:49,983 --> 00:39:52,262
Specialist in nuclear and game theory.

225
00:39:52,381 --> 00:39:54,427
Asked to resign ...

226
00:39:55,322 --> 00:39:58,000
... Well, because he's crazy.

227
00:39:58,052 --> 00:40:00,533
Cobalt.

228
00:40:02,425 --> 00:40:04,253
You have to allert the Kremlin that one of their strategist

229
00:40:04,254 --> 00:40:05,836
has a nuclear launch device.

230
00:40:06,484 --> 00:40:09,172
And what if his operative has the code activated

231
00:40:09,272 --> 00:40:11,588
What makes you say that?

232
00:40:11,941 --> 00:40:13,531
I saw him.

233
00:40:13,566 --> 00:40:16,022
Leaving the executive armory bag in hand,

234
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:18,474
he set off that explosion to cover his tracks.

235
00:40:18,509 --> 00:40:21,078
It maybe weeks before the Russians know it's missing.

236
00:40:21,823 --> 00:40:23,487
- Unless we tell them.
- They won't listen to us.

237
00:40:23,853 --> 00:40:28,197
As far as the Russian has concerned, we just bombed the Kremlin.

238
00:40:28,272 --> 00:40:31,726
Tension between United States and Russia, hasn't been this high

239
00:40:31,727 --> 00:40:33,307
since the Cuban Missile Crisis.

240
00:40:33,887 --> 00:40:38,247
And the blame, right or wrong, points to IMF.

241
00:40:43,123 --> 00:40:47,072
President has innitiated Ghost Protocol.

242
00:40:47,107 --> 00:40:51,337
The entire IMF has been disavowed.

243
00:40:53,276 --> 00:40:55,228
So what's happened now?

244
00:40:55,394 --> 00:40:58,802
Now I've been ordered to take you back to Washington.

245
00:40:58,837 --> 00:41:02,086
Where D.O.D  will labelled you as rough extremist,

246
00:41:02,121 --> 00:41:05,335
and hang the Kremlin bombing on you and your team.

247
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:07,490
Unless ...

248
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:12,554
... you were to escape somewhere between here and the airport

249
00:41:12,672 --> 00:41:16,479
airing on assaulted Mr. Brandt and me.

250
00:41:16,689 --> 00:41:18,071
Sir?

251
00:41:18,106 --> 00:41:23,152
You will then illegally scrounge
whatever material you could from backup supply cash..

252
00:41:23,187 --> 00:41:25,907
that I've overlooked the same cash..

253
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,627
- ..for your team awaiting for further orders.
- Sir, you may wanna read ...

254
00:41:28,662 --> 00:41:30,545
You will then disappeared.

255
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:33,563
And this conversation never having taken place..

256
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:36,786
but your intention would be unclear.

257
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:40,190
But if anyone of your team is caught or killed,

258
00:41:40,225 --> 00:41:42,375
they will be branded terrorists,

259
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,011
out to incite a global nuclear war.

260
00:41:53,016 --> 00:41:54,861
Your mission.

261
00:41:55,395 --> 00:41:58,481
Should you choose to accept it.

262
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:05,384
Ethan, you're my best man.

263
00:42:05,596 --> 00:42:07,755
And I'm sorry it's come to this,

264
00:42:07,790 --> 00:42:10,652
after all the sacrifices you've made.

265
00:42:12,213 --> 00:42:15,174
We don't meet again, I just want you to know ...

266
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:18,467
I will always consider you a friend ...

267
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,767
Stay down. Drive, drive, drive!

268
00:42:47,724 --> 00:42:50,423
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

269
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:53,144
Take deep breaths, stay with me.

270
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,194
- ready?
- yes

271
00:43:19,193 --> 00:43:21,175
What do we do?

272
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:24,215
Wait here.

273
00:43:25,418 --> 00:43:27,954
Where else to might I go?

274
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,632
Hey! hey, hey, hey.. There!

275
00:43:58,231 --> 00:44:00,552
Stop! Hold your fire!

276
00:44:01,376 --> 00:44:05,034
Hold your fire!

277
00:44:05,069 --> 00:44:06,596
Enough!

278
00:44:07,662 --> 00:44:09,911
Perhaps more are still alive.

279
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,615
Today, in a nearby prison two inmates escaped.

280
00:44:41,957 --> 00:44:45,425
Who is this? What we know about him?

281
00:44:49,073 --> 00:44:51,259
Why would that work?

282
00:44:52,183 --> 00:44:54,621
- Why what work?
- The flare on the body.

283
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:56,849
- What watt were they work?
- They did work.

284
00:44:56,884 --> 00:45:00,269
- Yeah, I know that...
- Hey!
- But why?

285
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:04,177
- I mean, how did you know that would draw their fire?
- I didn't.

286
00:45:04,287 --> 00:45:06,456
I played a hunch.

287
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:10,422
okay?
All right. What was your scenario?

288
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:13,483
Right, there was a guy being shot at the water.

289
00:45:13,518 --> 00:45:16,977
All the sudden, such a light out of a flare, turn around?

290
00:45:17,646 --> 00:45:19,976
I mean, what you assume maybe thinking

291
00:45:20,403 --> 00:45:22,940
- thinking?
- yeah.

292
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:24,860
I didn't assume they were thinking.

293
00:45:24,895 --> 00:45:27,032
I assumed they were shooting at anything to move

294
00:45:27,067 --> 00:45:29,383
and that just give them a target. But these ...

295
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:32,399
These guys are not schollars, you know?

296
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,256
- This is really happening, isn't it?
- Yeah.

297
00:45:41,489 --> 00:45:44,645
- Okay. You know what that sound is?
- It's our ride out of here.

298
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:48,187
Our ride's green car, with 47.

299
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:53,202
I see three.

300
00:45:53,653 --> 00:45:55,641
Okay, Let's do it! go, go, go, go!

301
00:45:58,991 --> 00:46:01,720
- All right. Forty-seven.
- I don't see it.
- Forty seven.

302
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:04,094
Oh shit!

303
00:46:10,190 --> 00:46:12,541
This is it. Where's the pass?

304
00:46:12,851 --> 00:46:14,447
Enter your code.

305
00:46:20,754 --> 00:46:22,730
Press ENTER.

306
00:46:24,718 --> 00:46:27,274
Retinal scanner.

307
00:46:29,188 --> 00:46:31,699
Retinal scan required.

308
00:46:31,734 --> 00:46:33,712
Watch out.

309
00:46:34,155 --> 00:46:36,016
Retinal scan required.

310
00:46:36,112 --> 00:46:38,603
Agent confirmed.

311
00:46:51,317 --> 00:46:53,850
Ethan?
Geez, I thought you were died.

312
00:46:54,183 --> 00:46:55,894
- We are.
- Who's this?

313
00:46:55,929 --> 00:46:59,494
Agent. Dunn and Carter.
William Brandt, chief analyst.

314
00:46:59,529 --> 00:47:01,564
Analyst.

315
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,919
Agent confirmed.

316
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:17,554
<i>Power of the world finally end.

317
00:47:19,252 --> 00:47:21,969
<i>It is my job to predict the unthinkable.

318
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:27,115
<i>To treat the death of billions as a game.

319
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,566
<i>After 20 years of this, I was none.

320
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:35,435
<i>Until a new question crossed my mind.

321
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:39,029
<i>What happens after the end of the world?</i>

322
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,820
Are you sure your line is secure?

323
00:47:41,063 --> 00:47:43,006
<i>Every 2 or 3 million years ...<i>

324
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,694
Are you certain your line is secure?

325
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:49,896
<i>... some natural catastrophy devastates all life on earth.

326
00:47:50,169 --> 00:47:52,101
<i>But life goes on.

327
00:47:52,377 --> 00:47:55,760
<i>And what little remain is made stronger.

328
00:47:56,094 --> 00:47:59,668
<i>Put simply world destruction, isn't unpleasant..

329
00:47:59,703 --> 00:48:02,768
<i>..but necessary part of evolution.

330
00:48:05,097 --> 00:48:07,072
<i>What happens then, I wondered.

331
00:48:07,212 --> 00:48:10,078
<i>When mankind faces the next end of the world.</i>

332
00:48:10,113 --> 00:48:12,799
I don't care what you have to do, to get him to Dubai.

333
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:15,486
<i>I'll make you worse as well. Just do it.

334
00:48:15,579 --> 00:48:19,337
<i>- I look to Hiroshima, Nagasaki.</i>
- Well, I'll be waiting for your call.

335
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:22,126
<i>Thriving cities, rebuilt from the ashes.

336
00:48:22,161 --> 00:48:24,354
<i>Monuments to unimaginable

337
00:48:24,389 --> 00:48:27,142
<i>dedicated to the concept of peace.

338
00:48:27,143 --> 00:48:30,044
<i>It's occured to me here, that nuclear war..

339
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,815
<i>might have a place in the natural order.

340
00:48:33,188 --> 00:48:35,658
<i>But only if it could be controlled.

341
00:48:35,744 --> 00:48:40,181
<i>Only if attached every living song equally.</i>

342
00:48:41,994 --> 00:48:46,402
IMF and I believe this man, Kurt Hendricks, is a nuclear extremist.

343
00:48:46,437 --> 00:48:48,279
Codename, Cobalt.

344
00:48:48,314 --> 00:48:50,737
Today he was seen leaving the Kremlin, that would most likely

345
00:48:50,738 --> 00:48:51,738
a nuclear launch device.

346
00:48:55,159 --> 00:48:58,106
A few days ago, Sabine Moreau killed one of our agents in Budapest.

347
00:48:58,141 --> 00:49:00,745
We believe him off Russian nuclear launch code.

348
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:05,341
Intel indicates she would check in the Burj Hotel in Dubai
in 36 hours.

349
00:49:06,574 --> 00:49:09,087
Mariusz Wistrom is known operative of Cobalt.

350
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,690
Wistrom is currently on route to Dubai.

351
00:49:11,725 --> 00:49:15,384
For the launch device to work, Cobalt needs the activation codes.

352
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:18,627
He's sending Wistrom, to buy them from Moreau.

353
00:49:19,416 --> 00:49:23,395
The Secretary is dead.

354
00:49:28,707 --> 00:49:31,627
The President has invoked Ghost Protocol.

355
00:49:32,329 --> 00:49:34,006
We're shut down.

356
00:49:34,041 --> 00:49:37,942
No satellites, safehouse, support or extraction.

357
00:49:37,943 --> 00:49:39,460
The four of us ...

358
00:49:39,712 --> 00:49:44,295
... and the content of this car
are all that remain of the IMF.

359
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:46,303
And as if this moment any actions are unsanctioned.

360
00:49:46,338 --> 00:49:50,225
So if you want out, speak now.

361
00:50:06,390 --> 00:50:07,919
Our mission is Hendricks.

362
00:50:07,954 --> 00:50:11,335
We're all  distance between him and his goal,
nothing can be left to chance.

363
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:14,716
Everyone connected with this man is considered an asset

364
00:50:14,751 --> 00:50:16,447
with valuable information about our target.

365
00:50:16,482 --> 00:50:18,108
No one can know we're still online.

366
00:50:18,143 --> 00:50:20,664
We lose Hendricks now, we lose him forever.

367
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:22,188
So, what's the plan?

368
00:50:22,223 --> 00:50:24,816
Wistrom  will take delivery from Moreau in 36 hours.

369
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:27,136
Now we can not let the launch codes leave the hotel.

370
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:30,255
But we need Wistrom to lead us to Hendricks.

371
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:32,590
Yeah, we only do that if he has the codes

372
00:50:32,625 --> 00:50:34,891
- Or if he thinks he has it.
- Objective. ..

373
00:50:34,926 --> 00:50:36,575
... is to intercept the sale.

374
00:50:36,704 --> 00:50:38,453
Place the authentic codes with counterfeits.

375
00:50:38,488 --> 00:50:41,704
- and follow Wistrom to Hendricks.
- Well, that's, that's simple enough.

376
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:43,941
We just, we snatch the codes, we generate some fakes.

377
00:50:44,055 --> 00:50:47,391
Jane, you double Moreau and sell the codes to Wistrom.

378
00:50:47,426 --> 00:50:48,600
And bob your ankle.

379
00:50:48,635 --> 00:50:52,450
And how do you propose, that we just snatch the code from Moreau?

380
00:50:52,554 --> 00:50:54,473
You take her out.

381
00:50:55,641 --> 00:50:58,674
Yeah, we take her out,but you know, discreetly.

382
00:50:58,883 --> 00:51:01,182
- Discreetly?
- Yeah.

383
00:51:02,346 --> 00:51:04,224
- Right, she's an asset.
- Right.

384
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:06,068
I get it. Sorry. Nothing left to chance, he said.

385
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:08,481
I'm just, I'm a spit bowling. You know, it's not all gonna be go.

386
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:11,893
- We don't touch Wistrom.. .
- All right.
-..or Moreau.

387
00:51:13,726 --> 00:51:16,723
As you asked for Hanaway, but it has to be when I say.

388
00:51:16,758 --> 00:51:19,365
After we had Hendricks.

389
00:51:24,307 --> 00:51:26,258
- Only pack what we need.
- Yeah absolutely.

390
00:51:26,293 --> 00:51:28,210
Only pack what we need. You never know.

391
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,222
DUBAI

392
00:51:56,035 --> 00:51:59,152
So even if we can double Wistrom and Moreau,

393
00:51:59,187 --> 00:52:01,649
How do we keep them in separate rooms,

394
00:52:01,684 --> 00:52:04,112
Or having they think they are in the same room?

395
00:52:04,378 --> 00:52:06,372
We give the hotel a facelift.

396
00:52:06,407 --> 00:52:09,077
Wistrom will think he's arriving at Moreau's suite.

397
00:52:09,428 --> 00:52:11,782
But really, he will be walking into our decoy room.

398
00:52:11,817 --> 00:52:13,391
Where I'll double Moreau.

399
00:52:13,426 --> 00:52:15,393
Downstairs Benji will double Wistrom...

400
00:52:15,428 --> 00:52:17,883
- a masks!
- And meet with real Moreau.

401
00:52:17,959 --> 00:52:21,476
And eh, huh, What am I doing?

402
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,745
You? You're the helper.

403
00:52:27,468 --> 00:52:29,989
Help ... okay.

404
00:52:30,104 --> 00:52:33,498
So, to the extent understand what are you talking about here  ...

405
00:52:34,622 --> 00:52:37,065
uhm, Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.

406
00:52:37,348 --> 00:52:39,488
And you want to alter its infrastructure,

407
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:41,556
with the hopes of convincing two people that

408
00:52:42,362 --> 00:52:45,591
they had a meeting, which actually really never happened ...

409
00:52:46,644 --> 00:52:48,685
Right?

410
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,226
Camels.

411
00:53:44,397 --> 00:53:46,710
ETA on dry cleaning.

412
00:53:46,968 --> 00:53:49,061
I'm on my way out.

413
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:53,928
Okay, 34 minutes to doorknock.

414
00:54:00,501 --> 00:54:04,732
wow,.. ehm, okay. this, this is a slight wrinkle,.. nothing, nothing to worry about.

415
00:54:04,767 --> 00:54:08,478
We're just gonna have to go into server room, from the outside.

416
00:54:09,797 --> 00:54:14,473
- What?
- Well, the firewalls in this building serve a  military grade.

417
00:54:14,508 --> 00:54:17,467
I mean, this would be a synched if I could call Yusuf back at headquarter,

418
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:19,882
but Yusuf doen't exist anymore, and neither do we.

419
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:21,488
I could hack it, but it would take too long.

420
00:54:21,523 --> 00:54:22,636
Their hardware in.

421
00:54:22,637 --> 00:54:25,383
And there's four layers of an exchange security because not in server-in.

422
00:54:25,418 --> 00:54:27,871
and there is no way we can get into it from inside.

423
00:54:28,193 --> 00:54:32,770
If we can't get through the server, we don't control the elevators, we don't control security cameras.

424
00:54:32,961 --> 00:54:34,977
This operation is over even before it begins.

425
00:54:35,012 --> 00:54:36,994
I'm telling you we can get to it from outside.

426
00:54:37,029 --> 00:54:38,865
We?

427
00:54:39,051 --> 00:54:41,589
I'm,  I'm on the computer.

428
00:54:42,497 --> 00:54:46,328
I'm just a ... the helper.

429
00:54:49,364 --> 00:54:52,218
- What floor is it now?
- 130.

430
00:54:52,783 --> 00:54:55,525
130 ?

431
00:54:58,343 --> 00:54:59,632
- Vent out?
- pressure's unstiff.

432
00:54:59,633 --> 00:55:00,633
don't have enough time.

433
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:02,008
- Elevator shaft.
- infrared sensors.

434
00:55:02,009 --> 00:55:03,009
don't have enough time.

435
00:55:06,924 --> 00:55:09,610
How am I suppose to do this?

436
00:55:15,017 --> 00:55:16,967
Dammit!

437
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:21,907
Oh, that's high.

438
00:55:26,686 --> 00:55:30,607
Okay, now remember, it's a rolling off motion, that disengages the bond.

439
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,840
When the emitter is blue, that's full adhesion.

440
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:34,880
Easy way to remember. "Blue is glue."

441
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,821
- And when it's red?
- Dead.

442
00:55:36,921 --> 00:55:39,555
ah, here's your cutter, okay?
And your server interface.

443
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:40,711
Both going back here.

444
00:55:40,746 --> 00:55:42,391
One, two.

445
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:45,091
Okay Ethan, holds-all service, 11 stories up

446
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,327
and 7 units over.

447
00:55:46,841 --> 00:55:47,762
Okay?

448
00:55:48,075 --> 00:55:51,011
- Com check?
- Yeah, copy.

449
00:55:52,859 --> 00:55:54,616
So ...

450
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:01,007
It's 26 minutes to doorknock.

451
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:15,007

452
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:17,700
Yeah ...

453
00:56:57,771 --> 00:57:00,082
25 minutes to doorknock.

454
00:57:15,062 --> 00:57:17,055
What the hell is that?

455
00:57:31,498 --> 00:57:34,263
Hell, what the hell is that?

456
00:57:35,456 --> 00:57:37,805
It's a sandstorm.

457
00:57:39,331 --> 00:57:41,925
It's a long way off, Ethan. There's shouldn't be a problem.

458
00:57:44,847 --> 00:57:47,335
24 minutes to doorknock.

459
00:57:50,481 --> 00:57:52,450
Where is Ethan?

460
00:57:54,459 --> 00:57:56,748
You gotta be kidding me.

461
00:58:45,696 --> 00:58:48,534
23 minutes to doorknock.

462
00:59:07,051 --> 00:59:09,169
I'm in the server level.

463
00:59:31,505 --> 00:59:34,093
23 minutes to doorknock.

464
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:37,163
Your countdown is not helping.

465
00:59:38,770 --> 00:59:40,676
I'm just saying.

466
01:00:10,138 --> 01:00:12,918
- I'm in.
- That's great, Ethan. You're half way home.

467
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,655
Located server.

468
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:30,361
Please tell me we're online.

469
01:00:30,468 --> 01:00:32,415
All right, we're live.

470
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:34,362
Okay, now I have control of the elevators.

471
01:00:34,462 --> 01:00:37,056
- And the security cameras.
- Time to evacuate.

472
01:00:37,091 --> 01:00:39,918
Okay. You drive, and look out for Wistrom and Moreau.

473
01:00:54,981 --> 01:00:58,063
Moreau is at the elevator. It has resceduled.

474
01:00:58,266 --> 01:00:59,749
Go.

475
01:01:04,972 --> 01:01:08,201
- We can't open this door, can  we?
- That door? No.

476
01:01:08,236 --> 01:01:10,743
Ethan you gotta get down here now.

477
01:01:11,262 --> 01:01:14,346
Ethan. Ethan. Is there a problem?

478
01:01:15,061 --> 01:01:16,667
Ethan?

479
01:01:22,952 --> 01:01:25,650
- We're not gonna make it.
- We have to make it.

480
01:01:26,529 --> 01:01:28,320
Where is Ethan?

481
01:01:50,040 --> 01:01:54,534
- Your line is not long enough!
- No, shit!

482
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,812
That was not easy, but I, I did it.

483
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:49,689
What I missed?

484
01:02:55,556 --> 01:02:59,066
The lense might be a little uncomfortable.

485
01:02:59,101 --> 01:03:02,609
It captures images and transmits them to the printer in the briefcase.

486
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:04,887
- All right?
- hmm...

487
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:07,273
I can't see, one eye right of it, fine.

488
01:03:07,308 --> 01:03:09,461
Blinks twice to activate the shutter.

489
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:13,357
Notice, the numbers are in order.

490
01:03:16,068 --> 01:03:18,504
A perfect copy.

491
01:03:18,937 --> 01:03:21,501
But the numbers are scrambled.

492
01:03:22,294 --> 01:03:25,489
Masks? ah, 60 seconds.
Are you sure that I shouldn't wear a mask?

493
01:03:25,524 --> 01:03:27,767
You know, cause I'm not exactly Omar Sharif.

494
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:30,135
I'll play a french. This is you tracking device.

495
01:03:30,135 --> 01:03:31,990
- This is what you're tracking.
- paper clip?

496
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,697
No, it's a paper. It's in the briefcase.

497
01:03:33,697 --> 01:03:35,781
It's caught to be isotops, which should give a unique  ...

498
01:03:35,781 --> 01:03:38,157
- It just means that you can track documents, even if they switch briefcases.
- Range?

499
01:03:38,157 --> 01:03:40,596
- Not that good, like a half a mile (800 meters).

500
01:03:40,596 --> 01:03:42,884
Safest thing to do not let Wistrom out of your sight.

501
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:44,534
Is that Wistrom?

502
01:03:48,981 --> 01:03:49,980
Who's out with him?

503
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,391
- I don't know.
- We don't have an uplink, so there's no facial recognition.

504
01:03:52,391 --> 01:03:54,843
Who's out with him?

505
01:03:55,228 --> 01:03:57,838
That's Leonid Lisenker. Polish phone cryptographer.

506
01:03:57,838 --> 01:04:01,097
He redesigned Russia's nuclear security at the Cold War.

507
01:04:01,098 --> 01:04:03,376
He set off to authenticate the launch codes.

508
01:04:03,376 --> 01:04:05,105
- yeah shit, we are blown.
- No, no, no.

509
01:04:05,105 --> 01:04:07,941
Well, we'll would be as soon as he sees the counterfeit launch codes.

510
01:04:07,941 --> 01:04:10,290
- We're not alone.
- He's in the elevator.

511
01:04:10,290 --> 01:04:12,467
Delay it.

512
01:04:20,767 --> 01:04:22,975
Benji, how long would take it reprogram the case?

513
01:04:22,975 --> 01:04:24,950
Ah, a couple seconds. Wow, What for that?

514
01:04:24,950 --> 01:04:27,969
- To make an exact copy of the launch codes.
- What?!

515
01:04:27,969 --> 01:04:30,060
- You can't do that.
- Wistrom's on 22.

516
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:32,427
- Slow him down.
- I do what I can.

517
01:04:34,365 --> 01:04:37,534
wait, wait, Ethan! Hey! Hang on now, hang on, just a second!

518
01:04:37,534 --> 01:04:41,033
You, you're talking about handing over active nuclear launch code to Wistrom?

519
01:04:41,033 --> 01:04:43,772
- the case, reprogram the case.
- Listen, listen, stop! Listen, listen.

520
01:04:43,966 --> 01:04:46,512
You're saying you're fixating, you're thinking clearly.

521
01:04:46,512 --> 01:04:48,333
Listen, that's not gonna happened!

522
01:04:48,560 --> 01:04:50,691
- I won't allow it.
- 33, and climbing.

523
01:04:50,691 --> 01:04:54,066
Brandt, use your head. The mission is not the code, the mission is Hendricks.

524
01:04:54,066 --> 01:04:56,273
And this little play out, give him back codes neutralize it.

525
01:04:56,273 --> 01:04:58,269
You know that won't do it. Failure to a terrorist...

526
01:04:58,269 --> 01:05:00,260
...just a rehearsal for success.

527
01:05:00,260 --> 01:05:01,529
41!

528
01:05:01,529 --> 01:05:03,928
We lose Hendricks today, he shows up somewhere else tomorrow.

529
01:05:03,928 --> 01:05:06,632
He finds another way. With no IMF to stop him.

530
01:05:06,632 --> 01:05:08,950
Now, it's now or never. Now hand me the case.

531
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:11,115
Nothing left to chance. You said that !

532
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,800
You're the analyst. Now tell me..

533
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:14,419
..there's another way for Hendricks to get those codes.
- 50!

534
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:18,226
You tell me that this is only happened
right here, right now. Today!

535
01:05:18,226 --> 01:05:20,073
You tell me that, I'll walk away.

536
01:05:28,197 --> 01:05:29,953
- We go without!
- Without masks?

537
01:05:29,954 --> 01:05:31,500
- Changes to go.
- Ethan!

538
01:05:31,501 --> 01:05:34,263
- We have no choice.
- Ethan, you will be walking on Moreau unarmed.

539
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,986
- Face first. Literally.
- How do we know they've met?

540
01:05:36,987 --> 01:05:38,862
- How do we know they haven't?
- It doesn't matter!

541
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,848
Damn! We have no choice.

542
01:06:34,374 --> 01:06:35,822
Goggles.

543
01:06:38,003 --> 01:06:40,096
What if they have met?

544
01:06:41,991 --> 01:06:44,143
Come in.

545
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:21,393
Which of one you is Wistrom?

546
01:07:21,954 --> 01:07:24,419
Which one of you is Wistrom?

547
01:07:26,318 --> 01:07:28,210
I am.

548
01:07:29,064 --> 01:07:31,571
I admire your work.

549
01:07:46,356 --> 01:07:48,369
Sit.

550
01:07:56,554 --> 01:07:58,618
Where are my codes?

551
01:07:59,546 --> 01:08:01,240
Where are my diamonds?

552
01:08:02,210 --> 01:08:04,039
close by.

553
01:08:04,648 --> 01:08:07,857
- You have my payment?
- When I see the codes.

554
01:08:08,763 --> 01:08:11,025
Not to worry. Come in!

555
01:08:11,368 --> 01:08:14,012
I thought we could have tea.

556
01:08:15,567 --> 01:08:17,993
Madam moiselle.

557
01:08:18,182 --> 01:08:20,386
Misseur.

558
01:08:20,386 --> 01:08:22,967
No diamonds, no codes.

559
01:08:23,152 --> 01:08:26,180
No codes, no diamonds.

560
01:08:29,795 --> 01:08:32,485
- Kill this one!
- We didn't came alone.

561
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,700
That hole I lay out there is killbox.

562
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,511
- You know who we work for.
- We come back for its codes,

563
01:08:37,609 --> 01:08:40,058
or we don't come back.

564
01:08:40,558 --> 01:08:43,476
- How good is your backup ?
- The best.

565
01:08:47,066 --> 01:08:49,201
Kill them the best.

566
01:08:50,069 --> 01:08:52,657
Do you care for some sugar?

567
01:08:56,083 --> 01:08:57,966
Enough. Let's get this done.

568
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,969
You want payment? I want guarantees.

569
01:09:01,071 --> 01:09:04,373
When he's authenticated the codes, I'll  make a call and get your diamonds.

570
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:07,170
That, or ...

571
01:09:07,308 --> 01:09:09,680
We alll go home in buckets.

572
01:09:10,222 --> 01:09:13,224
Nobody leaves this hotel alive.

573
01:09:16,628 --> 01:09:19,279
Get the papers .

574
01:09:32,232 --> 01:09:35,605
- Is there a problem?
- It's locked.

575
01:09:39,644 --> 01:09:42,518
Ah, forgive me.

576
01:09:42,518 --> 01:09:45,886
There must be a key. For momento.

577
01:09:49,372 --> 01:09:51,886
Misseur.

578
01:10:44,098 --> 01:10:47,983
My mistake. It is a combination. Not a key.

579
01:10:48,717 --> 01:10:51,449
You tell me the numbers!

580
01:10:56,342 --> 01:10:57,676
We're good.

581
01:10:57,676 --> 01:10:59,940
Zero

582
01:11:00,141 --> 01:11:02,048
zero

583
01:11:03,228 --> 01:11:04,922
zero

584
01:11:21,245 --> 01:11:23,272
Come on, come on, come on, came on, came on.

585
01:12:06,017 --> 01:12:08,194
It was a pleasure doing business with ...

586
01:12:08,194 --> 01:12:10,668
Wistrom has launch codes and he's on the move.

587
01:12:11,002 --> 01:12:13,574
Hey, I did what you asked, I did!

588
01:12:13,574 --> 01:12:16,479
- Now let my family go.
- Release Leonid's family.

589
01:12:16,596 --> 01:12:19,747
- Thank God!
- You can thank me in person.

590
01:12:34,546 --> 01:12:37,385
It was a pleasure doing business with you.

591
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:46,259
Kill him!

592
01:12:53,936 --> 01:12:55,873
Moreau's on the move!

593
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:58,190
I've got her.

594
01:12:58,837 --> 01:13:01,010
Jane, she's an asset.

595
01:13:01,010 --> 01:13:03,567
I need her alive.

596
01:13:04,492 --> 01:13:06,591
Acknowledge!

597
01:13:06,888 --> 01:13:09,026
Acknowledge!

598
01:13:19,633 --> 01:13:23,731
Ah, Ethan, Wistrom is in the elevator. I can't see Leonid there.

599
01:13:24,336 --> 01:13:27,852
Benji, slow it down. Give me an elevator.

600
01:13:39,636 --> 01:13:41,504
I'll handle it.

601
01:13:54,169 --> 01:13:58,023
Benji, I got a lot call of Wistrom, but I can't tell. Is he still in the elevator?

602
01:13:58,551 --> 01:14:01,505
- Wistrom ... elevator ...
- Benji?

603
01:14:05,021 --> 01:14:08,499
- Ethan, over!
- Benji. Benji, I lost.

604
01:14:08,499 --> 01:14:11,564
Ethan, can you hear me?
Ethan, can you hear me? over!

605
01:14:12,913 --> 01:14:14,625
Geez!

606
01:14:23,008 --> 01:14:24,874
- Watch her!
- Why, why me?

607
01:14:24,874 --> 01:14:27,579
If I'd do it, I'll kill her.

608
01:14:57,599 --> 01:15:02,066
Hold it, Team Leader.
Do you really think I wouldn't catch up of you?

609
01:15:02,066 --> 01:15:03,996
You and I are not enemies. It was a setup.

610
01:15:03,996 --> 01:15:08,029
We'll find out your lies soon enough. Move it!

611
01:15:09,716 --> 01:15:12,425
I'm sorry about this.

612
01:15:33,902 --> 01:15:34,823
Leonid!

613
01:15:34,824 --> 01:15:36,699
- Benji?
- Cover Benji!

614
01:15:36,700 --> 01:15:38,935
I've got Leonid by the elevator, he's been shot.

615
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:40,506
What?

616
01:15:51,188 --> 01:15:53,448
Hey, hey, stay with me, stay with me!

617
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:14,273
"No, no no no no no no no no no...

618
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:22,815
Jane, don't!

619
01:22:19,675 --> 01:22:21,218
Now what happened with Moreau, Jane?

620
01:22:21,218 --> 01:22:24,014
- She couldn't help us with...
- Yeah, so let's throw her off the building?

621
01:22:24,114 --> 01:22:26,161
- I didn't throw her!
- That's throw her off the building!

622
01:22:26,161 --> 01:22:28,687
She was not the mission, Jane.

623
01:22:28,687 --> 01:22:32,313
The mission was to track the file back to Hendricks.

624
01:22:32,680 --> 01:22:35,586
Whose in the wind ...

625
01:22:56,686 --> 01:22:59,866
Better have good news for me. Is he here?

626
01:23:01,694 --> 01:23:04,816
I got it. Talk to you later. I'll be there.

627
01:23:04,816 --> 01:23:08,094
But no one will be following me. Just make sure no one's following you.

628
01:23:08,194 --> 01:23:10,852
- And how the hell that the Russians find us?
- Why do you ask me for?

629
01:23:11,009 --> 01:23:13,610
Because you are in communication. You in charge covering our tracks.

630
01:23:13,611 --> 01:23:16,647
We can not afford to make mistakes like that now, Benji.

631
01:23:16,647 --> 01:23:19,038
You are  not a technician anymore. You're field agent.

632
01:23:19,038 --> 01:23:21,127
And you're just an analyst?!

633
01:23:22,014 --> 01:23:24,526
Right? Right?

634
01:23:26,144 --> 01:23:29,127
Who are you really, Brandt?

635
01:23:29,649 --> 01:23:31,520
- What do you ask me?
- What am I asking?

636
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,413
Let me see if I can put in another ...

637
01:23:40,857 --> 01:23:45,179
How does an agent whose skills like that, end up an analyst?

638
01:23:52,896 --> 01:23:55,541
What if we all have secrets?

639
01:23:56,539 --> 01:23:59,223
tell me, Ethan.

640
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:05,983
You tell me yours, I tell you mine.

641
01:24:18,374 --> 01:24:20,519
I'm all clear.

642
01:24:25,350 --> 01:24:28,980
I have friends in the region. Just sit tight. I'll send someone to get you out of here.

643
01:24:29,192 --> 01:24:31,155
What about Hendricks? What's the plan?

644
01:24:31,156 --> 01:24:34,077
The plan was first to stop him together.

645
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:37,402
- And what would you gonna do?
- Change the plan.

646
01:24:37,402 --> 01:24:39,510
Wait, that's it?

647
01:24:39,659 --> 01:24:41,996
What we gonna do? go after him alone?

648
01:24:43,907 --> 01:24:46,540
You can explain yourself, agent Brandt?

649
01:25:50,687 --> 01:25:53,513
I was in a protection detail in Croatia.

650
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:57,101
Shadowing the assets, husband and wife.

651
01:25:58,151 --> 01:26:02,035
We were never suppose to know we were there. Whole things routines as in no crap.

652
01:26:05,275 --> 01:26:11,521
Three years in,we caught wind that this Serbian hit squad was after our couple.

653
01:26:11,757 --> 01:26:15,654
But my team had it under control, I knew that they would coming.

654
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:21,315
But I couldn't shake this feeling that I should warn the couple somehow.

655
01:26:21,315 --> 01:26:24,383
I wanted to..  find the way to let them know

656
01:26:26,007 --> 01:26:29,133
But you know, orders are oders, so I didn't.

657
01:26:33,836 --> 01:26:38,210
One day, the husband decides to leave the hotel and go for a run.

658
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:39,798
So I followed him.

659
01:26:40,374 --> 01:26:43,113
And leave two men with the wife.

660
01:26:43,921 --> 01:26:46,058
When I get back,

661
01:26:46,058 --> 01:26:48,951
my guys were unconscious and the wife is gone.

662
01:26:49,875 --> 01:26:52,765
Local police found her body three days later.

663
01:26:53,881 --> 01:26:56,553
What was left over anyway.

664
01:27:01,502 --> 01:27:04,215
It was my last day on the field.

665
01:27:05,112 --> 01:27:08,461
I couldn't face another life or death situations after that.

666
01:27:08,461 --> 01:27:10,281
So, what happened with her husband?

667
01:27:10,495 --> 01:27:13,240
Never saw him again.

668
01:27:13,819 --> 01:27:18,653
Until two days ago, in Moscow, when the Secretary introduced me to Ethan Hunt.

669
01:27:22,285 --> 01:27:25,628
No, that's not what happened. She left him, you know.

670
01:27:25,622 --> 01:27:28,597
I heard that one too, Benji.

671
01:27:28,853 --> 01:27:32,481
But, unfortunately, I was there.

672
01:27:33,227 --> 01:27:36,953
Just like I was there when the Secretary got the phone call..

673
01:27:36,954 --> 01:27:41,491
..that Ethan was in custody for killing 6 Serbian nationals  in cold blood.

674
01:27:41,609 --> 01:27:43,690
- ah, I'm sorry, shouldn't hit?
- Yeah.

675
01:27:43,734 --> 01:27:46,769
Disavowed.

676
01:27:54,153 --> 01:27:58,629
Last thing I know ... I am on the plane to Dubai.

677
01:27:59,977 --> 01:28:03,776
Wondering the old time ... Do I tell him?

678
01:28:05,766 --> 01:28:08,512
How do I tell him?

679
01:28:09,457 --> 01:28:12,185
That I'm responsible.

680
01:28:13,926 --> 01:28:17,093
I could've warned him. I should've warned him.

681
01:28:19,652 --> 01:28:21,915
But I didn't.

682
01:28:22,956 --> 01:28:25,210
And she died.

683
01:28:30,846 --> 01:28:34,435
Sergei! Sergei, my friend!

684
01:28:34,435 --> 01:28:37,498
I told you, I was gathered here. Didn't I say?

685
01:28:37,498 --> 01:28:39,669
- I don't know it's him?
- Yes, it's him.

686
01:28:39,791 --> 01:28:42,004
You trust me, I trust you, right?

687
01:28:42,728 --> 01:28:47,024
This is the guy! This is the guy,
the one I told you about.

688
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:49,988
So, we can take these things off.

689
01:28:54,455 --> 01:28:57,637
Sorry, he's a great guy, but he doesn't know you like I do,
you understand.

690
01:28:57,637 --> 01:29:00,611
So, you work for American government?

691
01:29:01,835 --> 01:29:05,737
- And you are an arm stealer.
- No, no! Sergei, Sergei!

692
01:29:06,423 --> 01:29:10,517
He's independent defense coordinator, right?

693
01:29:11,589 --> 01:29:13,591
That's right, very classic job.

694
01:29:13,591 --> 01:29:16,337
- Listen, he's a friend.
- Those diamonds are for Bogdan.

695
01:29:16,338 --> 01:29:18,278
No, no, it's okay. He can have it.

696
01:29:18,593 --> 01:29:22,049
Whatever arrangements you made with my cousin, it's between you and him.

697
01:29:22,140 --> 01:29:24,795
You want something from me, you pay.

698
01:29:24,795 --> 01:29:27,700
You misunderstand. I am not buying.

699
01:29:27,794 --> 01:29:29,606
I'm selling.

700
01:29:29,743 --> 01:29:31,830
You selling?

701
01:29:32,009 --> 01:29:34,873
- Selling what?
- The future.

702
01:29:35,523 --> 01:29:37,513
Yeah, I got all I need, thank you.

703
01:29:37,513 --> 01:29:40,033
Our countries are on the break of war.

704
01:29:40,033 --> 01:29:42,322
War is very good for business.

705
01:29:42,322 --> 01:29:45,022
Nuclear war?

706
01:29:54,207 --> 01:29:55,415
Go on.

707
01:29:55,415 --> 01:29:58,571
I'm looking for a man named Kurt Hendricks. You may know him as Cobalt.

708
01:29:58,671 --> 01:30:01,538
In this case, I think you know what he wants.

709
01:30:01,720 --> 01:30:04,764
I bet he even try to buy it from you at some point.

710
01:30:05,819 --> 01:30:09,277
- Go on.
- He has a case, he has codes.

711
01:30:09,608 --> 01:30:12,656
But they're worthless without tactical satellite.

712
01:30:13,186 --> 01:30:16,080
I want to know where he get it.

713
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:19,990
A man with information like that would be a potential terrorist.

714
01:30:20,565 --> 01:30:27,106
And to your government, a potential terrorist is a terrorist.

715
01:30:29,499 --> 01:30:32,019
Do you help me?

716
01:30:32,019 --> 01:30:36,004
My friends become your friends.

717
01:30:38,082 --> 01:30:41,949
Sorry. I can not help you.

718
01:30:47,585 --> 01:30:52,164
I certainly can not tell you that, Russia quitely sold an obselete technical satellite...

719
01:30:52,164 --> 01:30:55,656
to a certain telecom in Mumbai.

720
01:30:56,387 --> 01:30:59,500
And who ever gave them that idea?

721
01:31:00,109 --> 01:31:02,559
An enterprising third party.

722
01:31:02,559 --> 01:31:04,040
Working on commission.

723
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:07,793
Helping old friends, making new ones.

724
01:31:07,793 --> 01:31:11,399
- Can the satellite be shut down?
- That would take a special skills then.

725
01:31:12,319 --> 01:31:14,642
You can not do it alone.

726
01:31:39,915 --> 01:31:42,727
- What's in the bags?
- It's our gear.

727
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:46,533
- How'd you get it?
- Made a friend.

728
01:31:47,339 --> 01:31:50,083
- I'm glad we could help.
- You can help now.

729
01:31:50,986 --> 01:31:53,600
- Look Ethan, before...
- Whatever happened, happened.

730
01:31:53,601 --> 01:31:59,083
We still have a chance to clean this up.
But we have to do it now, we have to do it together.

731
01:32:05,913 --> 01:32:08,403
Yeah sure, where are we going?

732
01:32:09,215 --> 01:32:11,363
India.

733
01:32:14,793 --> 01:32:17,442
- India? India?
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

734
01:32:21,176 --> 01:32:23,180
Love the jet!

735
01:32:23,180 --> 01:32:25,602
Where do you see the car?

736
01:33:09,620 --> 01:33:10,740
Brij Nath.

737
01:33:10,740 --> 01:33:13,161
Brij Nath. Playboy. Multimedia tycoon.

738
01:33:13,566 --> 01:33:16,700
On the surface, this turn network as state of the art

739
01:33:16,814 --> 01:33:20,150
but its  build time illegally acquired Cold War cast off

740
01:33:20,150 --> 01:33:22,095
including this,the Novosti satellite.

741
01:33:22,289 --> 01:33:24,087
Hendricks needs it to launch a nuclear strike,

742
01:33:24,087 --> 01:33:27,020
and we have to shut it down, before he gets that chance.

743
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:29,807
And to do that we need to get the acess codes from him,

744
01:33:29,807 --> 01:33:31,838
one way or another.

745
01:33:32,112 --> 01:33:34,398
And if I don't ...

746
01:33:34,624 --> 01:33:37,381
None of this works.

747
01:33:37,381 --> 01:33:40,122
- You can do this.
- Yeah.

748
01:33:40,528 --> 01:33:43,305
A week ago I would've believed you.

749
01:33:48,538 --> 01:33:51,412
I don't blame you for what happened.

750
01:33:55,807 --> 01:33:58,975
She took someone you cared about. That just not something ...

751
01:34:00,097 --> 01:34:01,920
...you just, let go.

752
01:34:02,559 --> 01:34:06,163
Did that make you feel better?

753
01:34:07,061 --> 01:34:10,045
When you kill the man who killed your wife?

754
01:34:18,042 --> 01:34:20,684
We can't get them back.

755
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:31,354
Okay, to shut down the satellite we have to manually tap into the central server.

756
01:34:31,521 --> 01:34:35,150
And you'll enter through the exhaust vent wearing this under your suit.

757
01:34:35,150 --> 01:34:37,346
I'll drop down into the computer ray

758
01:34:37,346 --> 01:34:39,727
and I'll catch you, and we have you along the relay room

759
01:34:39,727 --> 01:34:41,911
and you jack into the panel.

760
01:34:45,119 --> 01:34:47,805
Okay, so we enter the party separately as guests

761
01:34:47,805 --> 01:34:50,537
Ethan quarterbacks, while Jane gets the codes ...

762
01:34:50,538 --> 01:34:53,398
from billionaire, I switch off the vent, you jump into the computer,

763
01:34:53,398 --> 01:34:55,422
and I'll catch you, you plug in the transmitter,

764
01:34:55,422 --> 01:34:59,081
Ethan feeds me the codes, which I then use to pinpoint Hendricks' location.

765
01:34:59,081 --> 01:35:02,470
okay, you breach over something,

766
01:35:02,470 --> 01:35:07,387
I think it really important to computer array, part,..
or I just,.. jump?

767
01:35:08,015 --> 01:35:09,870
- And I catch you.
- Yeah.

768
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:12,070
I don't,.. Why is it so hard to grasp?

769
01:35:12,266 --> 01:35:16,355
what, why? it, it's 25 foot drop..

770
01:35:16,893 --> 01:35:19,086
- and it's using magnets.
- Yeah

771
01:35:20,176 --> 01:35:23,630
In lye of our recent efforts, the technology is. ..

772
01:35:23,630 --> 01:35:27,276
Science is sign. I'd be more worried about the heat.

773
01:35:28,454 --> 01:35:30,692
And then there is that... What heat?

774
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,850
Well it's like any computer, isn't it?
If you switch off the fan,

775
01:35:34,030 --> 01:35:36,040
it's gonna get really hot.

776
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:38,160
- Of course.
- Relatively, you know.

777
01:35:39,978 --> 01:35:43,637
Of course it will. So I'm jumping into a ...

778
01:35:44,962 --> 01:35:48,053
... an oven.
acentually.

779
01:35:48,419 --> 01:35:50,042
Yeah, acentually.

780
01:35:50,306 --> 01:35:53,599
But ...uhm, I'll catch you.

781
01:35:54,559 --> 01:35:56,767
Great.

782
01:36:01,349 --> 01:36:06,440
MUMBAI

783
01:37:18,401 --> 01:37:20,390
Com check?

784
01:37:20,490 --> 01:37:22,953
Saturn got you 5 by 5, Jupiter.

785
01:37:24,892 --> 01:37:26,814
This is Pluto.

786
01:37:28,450 --> 01:37:30,888
I have arrived at the party.

787
01:37:34,151 --> 01:37:36,572
There he is.

788
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:50,235
Get us that code.

789
01:37:57,786 --> 01:38:00,195
Venus is moving-in on target.

790
01:38:11,305 --> 01:38:13,557
Hook's in.

791
01:38:14,795 --> 01:38:17,409
you do make an impression.

792
01:38:20,583 --> 01:38:22,933
Why am I Pluto? It's even not a planet anymore.

793
01:38:23,547 --> 01:38:26,124
I think Uranus is available.

794
01:38:26,222 --> 01:38:28,256
Hehehe..
It's funny cause you said "anus".

795
01:38:42,302 --> 01:38:44,808
- I'm in position.
- Sending in the robot.

796
01:38:50,085 --> 01:38:52,753
He's moving to you. In your back.

797
01:38:53,839 --> 01:38:57,261
- Don't wanna make it too easy for him.
- We can be talking all the time.

798
01:38:58,399 --> 01:39:01,960
In 20 minutes I want a glass of Cuvée Louis on every guest's hand.

799
01:39:02,081 --> 01:39:04,897
And make sure all of them have  a bottle take home by the end of the night.

800
01:39:09,659 --> 01:39:11,885
Impressed yet?

801
01:39:12,099 --> 01:39:14,477
I'm more a Bourbon girl.

802
01:39:19,606 --> 01:39:23,283
I am Brij Nath. Welcome to my humble home.

803
01:39:45,995 --> 01:39:48,290
And.. robot's in position.

804
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,350
spinning down the turbine.

805
01:39:58,390 --> 01:40:02,712
He's emailing. Venus, V Venus, V Venus.

806
01:40:11,259 --> 01:40:14,545
Husband? Boyfriend?

807
01:40:15,111 --> 01:40:19,175
More of the co-worker.

808
01:40:19,175 --> 01:40:21,827
Saturn, take the lead.

809
01:40:25,598 --> 01:40:27,960
Okay.

810
01:40:36,523 --> 01:40:39,813
- jump now?
- Yes, commit jump!

811
01:40:39,951 --> 01:40:41,100
- Jump?
- Jump!

812
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:44,011
- And I catch you.
- Now!

813
01:40:47,012 --> 01:40:50,515
So, ah, you sure about the suit, right, Benji?

814
01:40:50,515 --> 01:40:52,796
Pretty sure.

815
01:40:53,024 --> 01:40:55,259
Now you're pretty sure?

816
01:40:56,035 --> 01:40:57,768
Jump!

817
01:40:58,305 --> 01:41:00,444
O God!

818
01:41:01,331 --> 01:41:03,222
Jump!

819
01:41:03,636 --> 01:41:05,319
Jump!

820
01:41:22,708 --> 01:41:24,949
Jupiter, he's gone.

821
01:41:29,711 --> 01:41:32,707
- Did you jump?
- Should I not in jump?

822
01:41:33,691 --> 01:41:36,179
Cause I jumped!

823
01:41:36,913 --> 01:41:39,031
Stand by.

824
01:41:46,299 --> 01:41:50,376
I'm playing a hunch. Don't hit me.

825
01:42:07,628 --> 01:42:08,910
Hello?

826
01:42:08,910 --> 01:42:12,992
My God, you are a passionate creature.

827
01:42:14,650 --> 01:42:17,772
I would like to show you my collection of art.

828
01:42:18,306 --> 01:42:22,038
- I was waiting for you to ask.
- Then you have to find me.

829
01:42:22,642 --> 01:42:25,404
- come on.
- I'm heading upstairs.

830
01:42:43,634 --> 01:42:46,459
All right, and be careful.
It probably getting a bit hot.

831
01:42:47,149 --> 01:42:49,866
You have to get to that satellite, before Hendricks does.

832
01:43:06,406 --> 01:43:10,504
<i>Look left, look up.
<i>I find your complicious passion intriguing.

833
01:43:11,356 --> 01:43:17,686
<i>You can keep repeat telling anyone, but he's not your type.completely not your type.
<i>He's completely cold, I'm hot.

834
01:43:18,969 --> 01:43:21,487
<i>Like all Indian men are very hot.<i>

835
01:43:21,587 --> 01:43:25,667
8 o'clock, he's at your 8 o'clock.

836
01:43:25,667 --> 01:43:28,855
<i>As you walk toward me, you're getting hotter.</i>

837
01:43:32,318 --> 01:43:34,740
It's too much! too much, too much!

838
01:43:38,841 --> 01:43:40,923
I see you.

839
01:43:41,943 --> 01:43:45,463
I heard you have one of the finest private collections in the world.

840
01:43:45,463 --> 01:43:48,406
Well, of the very licensed private  .

841
01:44:07,130 --> 01:44:09,222
Saturn, how are we doing in Relay room?

842
01:44:09,222 --> 01:44:11,390
in position.

843
01:44:12,962 --> 01:44:15,078
I see the satellite .

844
01:44:20,737 --> 01:44:23,640
- Can I help you gentlemen?
- I don't think so.

845
01:44:29,991 --> 01:44:32,260
I need those codes, guys.

846
01:44:40,463 --> 01:44:43,540
All originals from Shatpur district

847
01:44:46,781 --> 01:44:49,257
You know the tantrics believe ...

848
01:44:50,528 --> 01:44:54,844
That there's lust chakra hide on most subconscious of desires..

849
01:45:47,126 --> 01:45:51,319
Uplink to satellite. Reboot to original military specs.

850
01:45:51,363 --> 01:45:53,921
Download the virus.

851
01:46:01,132 --> 01:46:03,367
What hell is that?

852
01:46:04,304 --> 01:46:06,543
- What the hell is that?
- What the hell's what?

853
01:46:06,640 --> 01:46:09,851
- It's going haywire!
- It downloaded the virus from the satellite.

854
01:46:09,851 --> 01:46:12,888
Hendricks is killing the server, before we can count the satellite.

855
01:46:12,888 --> 01:46:14,787
Hendricks is reprogramming the satellite.

856
01:46:14,787 --> 01:46:17,523
He's gonna lost its capabilty in five minutes.

857
01:46:18,181 --> 01:46:20,600
- Is something wrong?
- No.

858
01:46:20,706 --> 01:46:23,359
Jane, you gotta move. We need that code.

859
01:46:23,359 --> 01:46:26,137
Finally we are alone.

860
01:46:32,813 --> 01:46:36,317
Venus, now is your turn.
You kick his ass and get the code.

861
01:46:37,187 --> 01:46:40,866
We are alone, aren't we?

862
01:46:40,876 --> 01:46:44,387
No one will interrupt us.

863
01:46:47,755 --> 01:46:49,803
Move and I break your neck!

864
01:46:49,803 --> 01:46:52,298
The override sequence for the relay station.

865
01:46:52,412 --> 01:46:55,040
Say it now, and never speak again!

866
01:46:56,014 --> 01:46:57,927
The codes!

867
01:46:58,049 --> 01:47:02,882
46-82-123.

868
01:47:05,693 --> 01:47:08,679
- Benji, what happened?
- The system crashed, we're too late.

869
01:47:08,761 --> 01:47:10,371
No, no, no. He reveals himself.

870
01:47:10,371 --> 01:47:12,510
Benji, can you pinpoint Hendricks location?

871
01:47:13,522 --> 01:47:17,331
Hendricks is signaling at a state room tv station 6.7 miles from here.

872
01:47:17,333 --> 01:47:20,381
Send me the coordinates. Good work Brandt.
Now, get the hell out of there.

873
01:47:20,416 --> 01:47:21,471
Back me up!

874
01:47:21,471 --> 01:47:24,741
Jane, time over on Nath. Meet me at the rally point.

875
01:47:29,421 --> 01:47:31,157
Sweet love.

876
01:47:31,434 --> 01:47:33,977
Faster, Benji. Just through it trough.

877
01:47:37,510 --> 01:47:40,367
Wait, stop! Take me through.

878
01:47:40,602 --> 01:47:44,023
It's not responding.
A liitle bit of patient would be appreciated.

879
01:47:59,600 --> 01:48:01,881
ah, can't reach the top!

880
01:48:03,243 --> 01:48:06,399
more fan, more fan, more fan!

881
01:48:06,645 --> 01:48:08,883
There's nothing I can do, it maxed out.

882
01:48:27,169 --> 01:48:29,203
Brandt?

883
01:48:29,759 --> 01:48:33,482
Next time, I gonna seduce the rich guy.

884
01:48:44,514 --> 01:48:46,852
Satellite's weaponized and online.

885
01:48:46,946 --> 01:48:49,206
Upload the new authentication codes.

886
01:48:49,206 --> 01:48:51,598
Lock Russian Central Command out of the system.

887
01:48:51,739 --> 01:48:55,096
Isolate the sub, with fire just one missile.

888
01:48:55,096 --> 01:48:58,148
An apparent retaliation for the Kremlin.

889
01:48:58,387 --> 01:49:00,338
That should start the ball running.

890
01:49:00,451 --> 01:49:01,951
I am here, Ethan.

891
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:04,472
How long it till Hendricks can launch the missile?

892
01:49:04,473 --> 01:49:06,403
Less than 30 seconds.

893
01:49:07,812 --> 01:49:09,802
Find another route.

894
01:49:10,717 --> 01:49:13,147
Turn left, up ahead, take the highway on the right.

895
01:49:27,516 --> 01:49:29,369
We have uplink.

896
01:49:39,392 --> 01:49:41,817
Ethan, Hendricks has started launch sequence.

897
01:49:41,817 --> 01:49:44,622
- How much time till the missiles are flight ?
- Three minutes!

898
01:49:48,785 --> 01:49:51,203
We're three  and half minutes out.

899
01:49:53,685 --> 01:49:55,790
We can make it.

900
01:49:56,641 --> 01:49:58,020
We can make it.

901
01:49:58,238 --> 01:50:01,658
Magellan Strait Pacific Ocean

902
01:50:26,231 --> 01:50:28,336
Next left.

903
01:51:02,747 --> 01:51:05,084
Ethan, we're too late.

904
01:51:05,217 --> 01:51:07,319
The missile's in the air.

905
01:51:19,499 --> 01:51:21,489
There has to be a way to abort the warhead.

906
01:51:21,489 --> 01:51:23,253
If there is a wild on the launch device.

907
01:51:23,253 --> 01:51:25,721
We gonna get that case!

908
01:51:35,201 --> 01:51:38,563
May there be peace on Earth.

909
01:51:42,807 --> 01:51:45,234
Disable the relay!

910
01:51:45,737 --> 01:51:47,905
Get Wistrom!
Inside, inside!

911
01:52:22,431 --> 01:52:24,206
Wistrom destroyed the relay.

912
01:52:24,206 --> 01:52:26,584
- Ethan ran after Hendricks and case, but..
- It doesn't matter if he has the case.

913
01:52:26,584 --> 01:52:28,200
We can't transmit the abort codes.

914
01:52:28,200 --> 01:52:32,022
- Can you fix it?
- ah yeah, but it's gonna be pointless we don't have any power.

915
01:52:32,057 --> 01:52:33,602
Wistrom!

916
01:52:35,034 --> 01:52:37,418
- Jane?
- I'm okay.

917
01:52:38,780 --> 01:52:40,835
oh, you are not okay, she's hit.

918
01:52:41,098 --> 01:52:42,635
You stay here and cover Benji.

919
01:52:42,635 --> 01:52:45,956
- Benji, get the single wire back online!
- I get the power on.

920
01:52:45,956 --> 01:52:47,130
We can do this.

921
01:56:01,576 --> 01:56:05,031
I'm taking that briefcase!

922
01:56:08,267 --> 01:56:10,315
No, no!

923
01:56:57,046 --> 01:56:58,826
- He's been gone too long.
- Dammit!

924
01:56:58,826 --> 01:57:02,862
Listen, when the power comes on,
this two drives are going to this bay, okay?

925
01:57:46,822 --> 01:57:49,707
Mission...
accomplished!

926
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:01,808
Damn!

927
01:58:30,667 --> 01:58:32,541
Do not shoot!

928
01:58:38,732 --> 01:58:40,889
This one is mine.

929
01:58:52,651 --> 01:58:56,170
So we are not enemies?

930
01:58:57,268 --> 01:59:00,735
There a phone call from that arm stealer in Dubai.

931
01:59:00,735 --> 01:59:03,798
You wanted me to find you.

932
01:59:06,069 --> 01:59:09,048
How else to deal with all these?

933
01:59:15,851 --> 01:59:18,807
hospital?

934
01:59:21,488 --> 01:59:25,463
SEATTLE

935
01:59:25,463 --> 01:59:28,090
<i>(news) ...some sort of aircraft.

936
01:59:28,090 --> 01:59:31,737
<i>but officials of Department of Defense  insisted was simply
a meteor...

937
01:59:31,737 --> 01:59:34,271
<i>large enough to be visible during daylight.<i>

938
01:59:34,271 --> 01:59:36,423
You actually said that?

939
01:59:36,423 --> 01:59:39,742
Outloud?
Mission accomplished?

940
01:59:40,142 --> 01:59:43,365
- I said it.
- You're still cornered Ethan.

941
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,486
And I can't imagine the look on that guy's face.

942
01:59:48,135 --> 01:59:50,382
- Hey
- These must be them.

943
01:59:50,291 --> 01:59:53,991
Luther Stickell, the affirmative,  Carter, Dunn and Brandt.

944
01:59:55,220 --> 01:59:58,971
I borrowed an entire week in the bottom of the San Francisco bay

945
02:00:00,012 --> 02:00:02,277
Well thanks to you class..

946
02:00:04,647 --> 02:00:06,908
Men, you know I got this ...

947
02:00:06,908 --> 02:00:10,055
I know. I see you in Kandahar.

948
02:00:13,327 --> 02:00:15,627
Hey thanks for meeting me.

949
02:00:15,627 --> 02:00:18,284
So, I heard the insurance companies refused into pay the claim

950
02:00:18,285 --> 02:00:20,283
on that car you crashed, Ethan.

951
02:00:20,284 --> 02:00:24,102
Something about intentional a hundred meters that could drop not being covered.

952
02:00:24,111 --> 02:00:25,834
Go figured.

953
02:00:28,762 --> 02:00:31,748
- How's the leg?
- Still working.

954
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:35,182
- You?
- Healing.

955
02:00:37,276 --> 02:00:39,530
I'm fine, by the way.

956
02:00:39,530 --> 02:00:43,215
But I'm not actually sleeping per say, you know.

957
02:00:43,215 --> 02:00:44,937
Caught sweats, middle of the night.

958
02:00:45,787 --> 02:00:48,537
All these people are just happy and smiling,

959
02:00:48,537 --> 02:00:52,766
and they are completely oblivious,
for the fact they were almost...vaporized.

960
02:00:53,604 --> 02:00:56,908
- and if I've been inferred...
- Dumb luck?

961
02:00:57,431 --> 02:00:58,744
Was it?

962
02:00:59,747 --> 02:01:03,490
I mean, look, we were unprepared, in the dark,

963
02:01:03,490 --> 02:01:05,562
disavowed.

964
02:01:06,070 --> 02:01:08,341
The only thing that functioned properly

965
02:01:08,817 --> 02:01:11,090
on that mission,

966
02:01:11,549 --> 02:01:13,714
was this team.

967
02:01:14,830 --> 02:01:17,478
I don't know how we ended up together,

968
02:01:19,374 --> 02:01:21,754
but I'm glad we did.

969
02:01:28,168 --> 02:01:30,468
Your missions.

970
02:01:30,468 --> 02:01:33,019
Choose to accept them.

971
02:01:37,677 --> 02:01:39,336
all right ... you know, I am in.

972
02:01:39,629 --> 02:01:43,412
Seriously, this is not as hard as any mission gonna rougher than the last one, is it?

973
02:01:45,154 --> 02:01:48,128
It's just ... a bomb, is it?

974
02:02:06,414 --> 02:02:09,078
- Thanks, Ethan.
- I thank you.

975
02:02:11,210 --> 02:02:14,122
- Agent Hunt.
- Agent Carter.

976
02:02:22,462 --> 02:02:24,607
Brandt.

977
02:02:26,702 --> 02:02:31,267
I'm not picking up that phone Ethan, because I don't think you want me the field

978
02:02:34,022 --> 02:02:36,693
I know your wife is dead.

979
02:02:38,340 --> 02:02:41,262
I was there in Croatia.

980
02:02:42,156 --> 02:02:44,867
I was there for one reason. One.

981
02:02:45,892 --> 02:02:48,224
And I failed.

982
02:02:51,652 --> 02:02:53,893
It was my job to protect her.

983
02:02:53,893 --> 02:02:56,826
How do you know she's dead?

984
02:02:58,524 --> 02:03:03,444
- where's the body?
- Did you see it?

985
02:03:05,190 --> 02:03:08,286
- You killed those Serbians.
- I had to get her back.

986
02:03:08,286 --> 02:03:10,132
You sent out to rankout prison.

987
02:03:10,132 --> 02:03:12,051
That was a sacrifice I'm willing to make.

988
02:03:12,051 --> 02:03:15,436
IMF suspected that Hendricks had people in rankout.

989
02:03:17,733 --> 02:03:20,799
And six dead Serbians was your idea of cover?

990
02:03:22,067 --> 02:03:24,846
I always not one, not

991
02:03:40,849 --> 02:03:43,611
Secretary never told me.

992
02:03:46,865 --> 02:03:50,257
I accepted the direct call prison mission on one condition.

993
02:03:50,257 --> 02:03:53,494
No one can know she's still alive.

994
02:03:54,018 --> 02:03:57,068
But ... you telling me.

995
02:04:04,425 --> 02:04:07,445
When did you find out that I was in Croatia?

996
02:04:07,546 --> 02:04:11,900
- I put your file, after India.
- Great.

997
02:04:13,766 --> 02:04:16,859
So, you had to fake your wife's death.

998
02:04:17,411 --> 02:04:20,658
As long as we're together, she can never be safe.

999
02:04:21,426 --> 02:04:24,244
It wasn't your job to protect her, Brandt.

1000
02:04:26,714 --> 02:04:28,923
It's mine.

1001
02:04:35,108 --> 02:04:39,039
- So we're good?
- We're good.

1002
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:02,878
<i>Good evening, Mr. Hunt.

1003
02:06:02,878 --> 02:06:06,824
<i>36 hours ago, there was a breach on military's communication network.

1004
02:06:06,824 --> 02:06:11,482
<i>Now, an emerging terror organization known as the Syndicate,

1005
02:06:11,482 --> 02:06:12,858
has control over entire drone fleet.

1006
02:06:12,858 --> 02:06:19,593
<i>Your targets: unknown.
Your mission, should you choose to accept it...</i>
