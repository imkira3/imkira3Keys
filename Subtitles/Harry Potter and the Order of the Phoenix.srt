1
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,856
I don't know about you,
it's just too hot today, isn't it?

2
00:00:57,023 --> 00:01:01,360
And it's going to get even worse.
Temperatures in the mid-30s Celsius...

3
00:01:01,527 --> 00:01:05,239
...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit,
tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100.

4
00:01:05,406 --> 00:01:08,075
So, please, remember to cover up
and stay cool...

5
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:11,078
...with the hottest hits on your FM dial.

6
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:13,998
Come on, guys, time to go home.

7
00:01:14,749 --> 00:01:16,876
Come on, love, off you get.

8
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:22,256
- Do we have to?
- Yes, we do.

9
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:25,802
I'll make you your favorite dinner
to compensate.

10
00:01:27,178 --> 00:01:28,846
He squealed like a pig, didn't he?

11
00:01:29,013 --> 00:01:32,558
Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D.
Did you see his face?

12
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,560
Hey, Big D.

13
00:01:35,436 --> 00:01:37,063
Beat up another 10-year-old?

14
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:39,732
- This one deserved it.
- Yeah.

15
00:01:40,316 --> 00:01:44,570
- Five against one, very brave.
- Well, you're one to talk.

16
00:01:44,737 --> 00:01:49,992
Moaning in your sleep every night?
At least I'm not afraid of my pillow.

17
00:01:52,161 --> 00:01:54,997
"Don't kill Cedric."

18
00:01:55,414 --> 00:01:57,083
Who's Cedric, your boyfriend?

19
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:02,421
- Shut up.
- "He's going to kill me, Mum."

20
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:05,091
Where is your mum?

21
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:08,553
Where is your mum, Potter?

22
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:10,763
She dead?

23
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,599
Is she dead?

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,434
Is she a dead Pott...?

25
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:31,450
- Dudley.
- Dudley, let's go.

26
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,205
- What's going on?
- What are you doing?

27
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:39,333
- I'm not doing anything.
- We're getting out of here, Dudley.

28
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,043
Come on, Dudley, hurry up.

29
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:33,347
Dudley, run.

30
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,384
Expecto Patronum.

31
00:04:40,247 --> 00:04:42,040
Mrs. Figg.

32
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,005
Don't put away your wand, Harry.

33
00:04:48,297 --> 00:04:50,674
They might come back.

34
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:54,928
Dementors in Little Whinging,
whatever next?

35
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:59,057
- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy.
- I don't understand. How do you know...?

36
00:04:59,224 --> 00:05:01,435
Dumbledore asked me
to keep an eye on you.

37
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,980
Dumbledore asked you?
You know Dumbledore?

38
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:08,984
After You-Know-Who
killed that poor Diggory boy last year...

39
00:05:09,151 --> 00:05:11,820
...did you expect him to let you
go wandering on your own?

40
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:14,656
Good Lord, boy.
They told me you were intelligent.

41
00:05:14,823 --> 00:05:17,951
Now, get inside and stay there.

42
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:22,790
Expect someone will be in touch soon.
Whatever happens, don't leave the house.

43
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:34,593
It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere.

44
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,887
There's sweat. There's stifling.

45
00:05:37,054 --> 00:05:38,972
Diddykins?

46
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:41,308
Is that you?

47
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,648
Duddy. Vernon, come quick.

48
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,859
We're going to have to
take him to a hospital.

49
00:05:51,026 --> 00:05:53,153
Who did this to you, boy?

50
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,326
Happy, are we, now?

51
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:03,330
You've finally done it.
You've finally driven him loopy.

52
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:06,333
Vernon, don't say that.

53
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,838
Well, just look at him, Petunia.
Our boy has gone yumpy.

54
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:13,173
I've reached my limit, do you hear?

55
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:17,177
This is the last I'm gonna take
of you and your nonsense.

56
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,193
- Dear Mr. Potter.
- What?

57
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,615
The Ministry has received intelligence
that at 6:23 this evening...

58
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:43,537
...you performed the Patronus Charm
in the presence of a Muggle.

59
00:06:43,745 --> 00:06:45,789
As a clear violation...

60
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:50,043
...of the Decree for the Reasonable
Restriction of Underage Sorcery...

61
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,337
...you are hereby expelled...

62
00:06:52,754 --> 00:06:56,216
...from Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

63
00:06:56,925 --> 00:07:01,346
Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk.

64
00:07:05,476 --> 00:07:07,811
Justice.

65
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,242
He's not very well.

66
00:07:34,797 --> 00:07:36,590
Sorry, Hedwig.

67
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:45,577
Very clean, these Muggles.

68
00:08:45,952 --> 00:08:48,830
- Tonks, for God's sake.
- Unnatural.

69
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:54,335
Professor Moody.

70
00:08:54,794 --> 00:08:57,839
- What are you doing here?
- Rescuing you, of course.

71
00:09:00,717 --> 00:09:03,428
But where are we going?
The letter said I've been expelled.

72
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:06,014
You haven't been. Not yet.
Kingsley, you take point.

73
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:07,223
But the letter said...

74
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,393
Dumbledore persuaded the minister
to suspend your expulsion...

75
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,729
...pending a formal hearing.
- A hearing?

76
00:09:12,896 --> 00:09:16,274
Don't worry. We'll explain everything
when we get back to headquarters.

77
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,735
Not here, Nymphadora.

78
00:09:18,902 --> 00:09:22,739
Don't call me Nymphadora.

79
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:32,207
Stay in formation, everyone.
Don't break ranks if one of us is killed.

80
00:10:21,965 --> 00:10:24,050
Come on, you, around the corner.

81
00:10:26,094 --> 00:10:27,554
Come on.

82
00:11:06,968 --> 00:11:08,761
In you go, son.

83
00:11:10,305 --> 00:11:11,806
There've been no sightings.

84
00:11:11,973 --> 00:11:13,683
No deaths. No proof.

85
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:16,728
He almost killed Harry.
If that isn't proof enough...

86
00:11:16,895 --> 00:11:20,815
Yes, but guarding you-know-what
is the most important...

87
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:25,528
We must trust Dumbledore on this.

88
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:30,116
Was he able to protect Harry last year?
Tonight I say it's time to take action.

89
00:11:30,283 --> 00:11:33,495
Cornelius Fudge is a politician first
and a wizard second.

90
00:11:33,661 --> 00:11:36,831
- His instinct would be to ignore it...
- Keep your voices down.

91
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:41,419
He's getting stronger and stronger
by the minute. We have to act now.

92
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:47,675
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

93
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:52,847
Heavens, you're all right.

94
00:11:56,351 --> 00:12:00,063
Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait
until after the meeting's finished.

95
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:05,360
Nope. No time to explain.
Straight upstairs, first door on the left.

96
00:12:05,735 --> 00:12:07,195
Yeah.

97
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:14,661
Mudblood, werewolves,
traitors, thieves.

98
00:12:14,828 --> 00:12:19,707
If my poor mistress
knew the scum they let into her house...

99
00:12:19,874 --> 00:12:22,168
...what would she say to old Kreacher?

100
00:12:23,211 --> 00:12:26,214
Oh, the shame.

101
00:12:38,601 --> 00:12:41,312
- Freaks.
- There, there, mistress.

102
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:44,899
Scum of the earth.
Not like it was in the days of my fathers.

103
00:12:45,066 --> 00:12:47,694
Kreacher is here.

104
00:12:51,739 --> 00:12:53,199
Oh, Harry.

105
00:12:55,994 --> 00:12:59,831
Are you all right? We overheard them
talking about the Dementor attack.

106
00:12:59,998 --> 00:13:02,834
- You must tell us everything.
- Let the man breathe, Hermione.

107
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:07,213
And this hearing at the Ministry.
It's just outrageous.

108
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:09,549
I've looked it up.
They simply can't expel you.

109
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:12,427
- It's completely unfair.
- Yeah.

110
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:15,555
There's a lot of that
going round at the moment.

111
00:13:17,432 --> 00:13:19,392
So, what is this place?

112
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:22,270
- It's headquarters.
- Of the Order of the Phoenix.

113
00:13:23,062 --> 00:13:24,564
It's a secret society.

114
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,275
Dumbledore formed it back when
they fought You-Know-Who.

115
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:30,028
Couldn't have put any of this
in a letter, I suppose?

116
00:13:30,695 --> 00:13:32,906
I've gone all summer
without a scrap of news.

117
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:37,119
We wanted to write, mate.
Really, we did.

118
00:13:37,286 --> 00:13:38,329
- Only...
- Only what?

119
00:13:38,496 --> 00:13:41,707
Only Dumbledore made us swear
not to tell you anything.

120
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:45,211
Dumbledore said that?

121
00:13:47,004 --> 00:13:49,757
But why would he keep me in the dark?
Maybe I could help.

122
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:51,884
I'm the one
who saw Voldemort return...

123
00:13:52,051 --> 00:13:54,887
...the one who fought him,
who saw Cedric Diggory get killed.

124
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:57,264
- Harry.
- Thought we heard your dulcet tones.

125
00:13:57,431 --> 00:14:01,477
- Don't bottle it up, though. Let it out.
- If you're all done shouting...

126
00:14:01,644 --> 00:14:04,146
Do you wanna hear something
a little more interesting?

127
00:14:05,481 --> 00:14:08,818
If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry.
If it wasn't for Harry...

128
00:14:08,984 --> 00:14:11,028
...we wouldn't even know
Voldemort was back.

129
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:12,780
He's not a child, Molly.

130
00:14:12,947 --> 00:14:15,324
But he's not an adult either.

131
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:18,536
- He's not James, Sirius.
- Well, he's not your son.

132
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:20,871
He's as good as.

133
00:14:21,247 --> 00:14:22,957
- Who else has he got?
- Hey, Ginny.

134
00:14:23,124 --> 00:14:25,543
- He's got me.
- How touchingly paternal, Black.

135
00:14:25,709 --> 00:14:28,838
Perhaps Potter will grow up
to be a felon, just like his godfather.

136
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,756
Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus.

137
00:14:30,923 --> 00:14:33,008
- Snape's part of the Order?
- Git.

138
00:14:33,175 --> 00:14:35,010
About your supposed reformation.

139
00:14:35,177 --> 00:14:37,930
- I know better.
- So why don't you tell him?

140
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:39,807
- Get off it.
- Quick.

141
00:14:39,974 --> 00:14:41,600
- Get it up.
- Crookshanks.

142
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:44,186
- Stop it.
- Get off, you bloody cat.

143
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:46,605
- Crookshanks. Leave it alone.
- Get it up.

144
00:14:48,566 --> 00:14:52,236
- Hermione, I hate your cat.
- Bad Crookshanks.

145
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:56,157
Well, we'll be eating
down in the kitchen.

146
00:14:57,074 --> 00:14:59,410
Just because you're allowed
to use magic now...

147
00:14:59,577 --> 00:15:02,621
...does not mean you have to
whip your wands out for everything.

148
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,373
Hi, Mum.

149
00:15:05,374 --> 00:15:07,084
You hungry, Harry?

150
00:15:07,251 --> 00:15:09,879
You sure you're all right, Harry?
Gave us quite a turn.

151
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:12,214
Harry Potter.

152
00:15:14,425 --> 00:15:16,218
Sirius.

153
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:24,226
This is very, very peculiar.

154
00:15:24,393 --> 00:15:28,063
It seems your hearing in the Ministry
is to be before the entire Wizengamot.

155
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:31,692
I don't understand. What has
the Ministry of Magic got against me?

156
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:36,030
Show him. He'll find out soon enough.

157
00:15:46,415 --> 00:15:49,418
He's been attacking Dumbledore as well.

158
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:56,258
Fudge is using all his power, including
his influence at the Daily Prophet...

159
00:15:56,592 --> 00:15:59,595
...to smear anyone who claims
the Dark Lord has returned.

160
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,055
Why?

161
00:16:01,222 --> 00:16:03,182
He thinks Dumbledore's after his job.

162
00:16:03,349 --> 00:16:05,476
No one in their right mind
could believe that...

163
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:08,521
Exactly the point.
Fudge isn't in his right mind.

164
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:11,232
It's been twisted and warped by fear.

165
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,319
Now, fear makes people
do terrible things, Harry.

166
00:16:15,486 --> 00:16:17,947
The last time
Voldemort gained power...

167
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:21,450
...he almost destroyed
everything we hold most dear.

168
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:25,538
Now he's returned, and I'm afraid
the minister will do almost anything...

169
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:28,624
...to avoid facing that terrifying truth.

170
00:16:29,917 --> 00:16:34,588
We think Voldemort
wants to build up his army again.

171
00:16:35,714 --> 00:16:38,384
Fourteen years ago,
he had huge numbers at his command.

172
00:16:38,551 --> 00:16:43,139
And not just witches and wizards,
but all manner of dark creatures.

173
00:16:43,722 --> 00:16:47,768
He's been recruiting heavily, and we've
been attempting to do the same.

174
00:16:48,686 --> 00:16:52,481
But gathering followers
isn't the only thing he's interested in.

175
00:16:55,401 --> 00:16:57,236
We believe...

176
00:16:58,195 --> 00:17:00,156
...Voldemort may be after something.

177
00:17:00,322 --> 00:17:01,448
Sirius.

178
00:17:05,077 --> 00:17:07,955
Something he didn't have last time.

179
00:17:09,415 --> 00:17:11,459
You mean like a weapon?

180
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:15,671
No. That's enough. He's just a boy.

181
00:17:15,838 --> 00:17:18,674
You say more and you might as well
induct him into the Order.

182
00:17:18,841 --> 00:17:22,636
Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's
raising an army, then I want to fight.

183
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,984
Harry.

184
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,403
You are hereby expelled.

185
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,364
Before the entire Wizengamot.

186
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:53,501
Trains. Underground.

187
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,961
Ingenious, these Muggles.

188
00:18:13,145 --> 00:18:14,980
Here we are.

189
00:18:16,774 --> 00:18:21,237
I've never used the visitors' entrance
before. Should be fun.

190
00:18:21,946 --> 00:18:26,283
Right. Good.
I'll just get my Muggle money.

191
00:19:06,283 --> 00:19:09,202
Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons
trading on the potions market.

192
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:12,664
Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen.
Anybody for Daily Prophet?

193
00:19:12,831 --> 00:19:15,834
Dumbledore: Is he daft,
or is he dangerous?

194
00:19:37,814 --> 00:19:40,609
- Morning, Arthur.
- Morning, Bob.

195
00:19:43,236 --> 00:19:44,821
Interdepartmental memos.

196
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:48,950
We used to use owls.
Mess was unbelievable.

197
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,501
Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley.

198
00:19:57,667 --> 00:19:59,503
They've changed the time
of your hearing.

199
00:19:59,669 --> 00:20:01,046
When is it?

200
00:20:01,463 --> 00:20:03,340
In five minutes.

201
00:20:11,014 --> 00:20:14,226
Department of Mysteries.

202
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:20,899
And I'm confident, minister,
that you will do the right thing.

203
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:23,193
Yes, but we must be...

204
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:33,745
Remember, during the hearing,
speak only when you're spoken to.

205
00:20:33,912 --> 00:20:37,457
Keep calm.
You've done nothing wrong.

206
00:20:37,749 --> 00:20:41,044
As the Muggles say, truth will out.

207
00:20:41,545 --> 00:20:42,879
Yes?

208
00:20:44,047 --> 00:20:46,383
I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid.

209
00:20:48,009 --> 00:20:49,761
Good luck, Harry.

210
00:20:53,723 --> 00:20:56,226
Disciplinary hearing
of the 12th of August...

211
00:20:56,393 --> 00:20:59,354
...into offenses committed
by Harry James Potter...

212
00:20:59,521 --> 00:21:03,150
...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive,
Little Whinging, Surrey.

213
00:21:03,316 --> 00:21:06,403
Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge,
Minister of Mag...

214
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,405
Witness for the defense.

215
00:21:08,572 --> 00:21:11,741
Albus Percival Wulfric...

216
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:15,495
...Brian Dumbledore.

217
00:21:15,787 --> 00:21:19,082
You got our message
that the time and place of the hearing...

218
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:21,793
...had been changed, did you?
- I must have missed it.

219
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,922
But by a happy mistake, I arrived
at the Ministry three hours early.

220
00:21:28,884 --> 00:21:30,093
The charges?

221
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,762
The charges against the accused
are as follows:

222
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:34,598
"That he did knowingly...

223
00:21:34,764 --> 00:21:38,310
...and in full awareness
of the illegality of his actions...

224
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:41,480
...produce a Patronus Charm...

225
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:44,900
...in the presence of a Muggle."

226
00:21:45,066 --> 00:21:48,361
- Do you deny producing said Patronus?
- No, but...

227
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:51,990
And you were aware that you were
forbidden to use magic outside school...

228
00:21:52,157 --> 00:21:55,035
...while under the age of 17?
- Yes, I was, but...

229
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:58,580
Witches and wizards
of the Wizengamot...

230
00:21:58,747 --> 00:22:00,957
I was only doing it
because of the Dementors.

231
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,337
Dementors?

232
00:22:05,962 --> 00:22:07,631
In Little Whinging?

233
00:22:07,798 --> 00:22:10,133
That's quite clever.

234
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,470
Muggles can't see Dementors,
can they, boy?

235
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,847
- Highly convenient.
- I'm not lying.

236
00:22:16,014 --> 00:22:18,600
- There were two of them, if I hadn't...
- Enough.

237
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:22,979
I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure
would be a very well-rehearsed story...

238
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:27,651
...but since you can produce
no witnesses of the event...

239
00:22:27,818 --> 00:22:32,405
Pardon me, minister,
but as it happens, we can.

240
00:22:35,742 --> 00:22:38,829
Please describe the attack.

241
00:22:41,623 --> 00:22:43,416
What did they look like?

242
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,422
Well, one of them was very large
and the other rather skinny.

243
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:53,343
Not the boys. The Dementors.

244
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:57,180
Oh, right, right. Well, big.

245
00:22:58,348 --> 00:23:02,978
Cloaked. Then everything went cold...

246
00:23:03,603 --> 00:23:07,023
...as though all the happiness
had gone from the world.

247
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:12,279
Now, look here. Dementors don't just
wander into a Muggle suburb...

248
00:23:12,445 --> 00:23:16,074
...and happen across a wizard.
The odds are astronomical.

249
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:17,993
I don't think anyone would believe...

250
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,204
...the Dementors were there
by coincidence, minister.

251
00:23:23,707 --> 00:23:26,585
I'm sure I must have misunderstood you,
professor.

252
00:23:26,751 --> 00:23:32,257
Dementors are, after all, under
the control of the Ministry of Magic.

253
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:36,636
And it's so silly of me, but it sounded
for a moment as though...

254
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:40,807
...you were suggesting that the Ministry
had ordered the attack on this boy.

255
00:23:40,974 --> 00:23:43,768
That would be disturbing indeed,
Madam Undersecretary...

256
00:23:43,935 --> 00:23:48,107
...which is why I'm sure the Ministry
will be mounting a full-scale inquiry...

257
00:23:48,274 --> 00:23:51,652
...into why the two Dementors
were so very far from Azkaban...

258
00:23:51,819 --> 00:23:55,198
...and why they mounted an attack
without authorization.

259
00:23:56,073 --> 00:23:58,284
Of course, there is someone...

260
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:01,245
...who might be behind the attack.

261
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:08,878
Cornelius, I implore you to see reason.

262
00:24:09,045 --> 00:24:13,591
The evidence that the Dark Lord
has returned is incontrovertible.

263
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:16,552
He is not back.

264
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,644
In the matter of Harry Potter...

265
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:27,647
...the law clearly states...

266
00:24:27,897 --> 00:24:32,276
...that magic may be used before
Muggles in life-threatening situations.

267
00:24:32,443 --> 00:24:35,363
Laws can be changed if necessary,
Dumbledore.

268
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:38,699
Clearly. Has it become practice
to hold a full criminal trial...

269
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:41,744
...to deal with a simple matter
of underage magic?

270
00:24:50,128 --> 00:24:53,714
Those in favor of conviction?

271
00:25:02,515 --> 00:25:07,478
Those in favor
of clearing the accused of all charges?

272
00:25:21,576 --> 00:25:23,828
Cleared of all charges.

273
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,624
Professor.

274
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:44,640
Padfoot. Are you barking mad?

275
00:25:44,807 --> 00:25:47,185
You'll blow the entire operation.

276
00:25:55,568 --> 00:25:58,196
Sirius, what are you doing here?
If somebody sees you...

277
00:25:58,362 --> 00:26:00,990
I had to see you off, didn't I?

278
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:05,286
What's life without a little risk?

279
00:26:05,495 --> 00:26:07,830
I don't wanna see you
get chucked back in Azkaban.

280
00:26:07,997 --> 00:26:09,457
Don't worry about me.

281
00:26:09,874 --> 00:26:14,879
Anyway, I wanted you to have this.

282
00:26:20,259 --> 00:26:23,304
Original Order of the Phoenix.

283
00:26:23,846 --> 00:26:25,556
Marlene McKinnon.

284
00:26:25,723 --> 00:26:28,309
She was killed
two weeks after this was taken.

285
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:31,854
Voldemort wiped out her entire family.

286
00:26:32,271 --> 00:26:34,065
Frank and Alice Longbottom.

287
00:26:34,232 --> 00:26:35,733
Neville's parents.

288
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,570
They suffered a fate worse than death,
you ask me.

289
00:26:41,531 --> 00:26:43,991
It's been 14 years.

290
00:26:44,826 --> 00:26:49,038
And still a day doesn't go by
I don't miss your dad.

291
00:26:53,709 --> 00:26:56,379
Do you really think
there's going to be a war, Sirius?

292
00:26:59,048 --> 00:27:02,093
It feels like it did before.

293
00:27:06,305 --> 00:27:08,099
You keep it.

294
00:27:08,599 --> 00:27:12,979
Anyway, I suppose
you're the young ones now.

295
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:17,024
I'll see you at the train.

296
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,235
Bye-bye, darling.

297
00:27:20,111 --> 00:27:21,612
I love you.

298
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:24,365
Hold my hand, lovey.

299
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:26,909
There they are.
They're in the far carriage.

300
00:27:27,076 --> 00:27:28,369
Bye.

301
00:28:10,578 --> 00:28:13,498
I'm surprised the Ministry's
still letting you walk around free.

302
00:28:13,664 --> 00:28:15,166
Better enjoy it while you can.

303
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:18,628
I expect there's a cell in Azkaban
with your name on it.

304
00:28:21,214 --> 00:28:25,176
- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter.
- Just stay away from me!

305
00:28:26,385 --> 00:28:28,221
It's only Malfoy.

306
00:28:29,055 --> 00:28:30,890
What'd you expect?

307
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,037
Hi, guys.

308
00:28:52,204 --> 00:28:53,872
- Hey, Neville.
- Hey there, Neville.

309
00:29:06,927 --> 00:29:08,470
What is it?

310
00:29:10,639 --> 00:29:13,892
- What's what?
- That. Pulling the carriage.

311
00:29:14,726 --> 00:29:17,062
Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry.

312
00:29:17,688 --> 00:29:19,898
It's pulling itself, like always.

313
00:29:33,537 --> 00:29:35,747
You're not going mad.

314
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,586
I can see them too.

315
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:44,423
You're just as sane as I am.

316
00:29:49,261 --> 00:29:51,305
Everyone, this is Loony Love...

317
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,018
Luna Lovegood.

318
00:29:59,938 --> 00:30:02,274
What an interesting necklace.

319
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:04,985
It's a charm, actually.

320
00:30:06,361 --> 00:30:07,946
Keeps away the Nargles.

321
00:30:11,742 --> 00:30:13,243
Hungry.

322
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:15,871
I hope there's pudding.

323
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:20,459
- What's a Nargle?
- No idea.

324
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:34,807
Good evening, children.

325
00:30:36,099 --> 00:30:38,811
Now, we have two changes
in staffing this year.

326
00:30:38,977 --> 00:30:42,022
We're pleased to welcome back
Professor Grubbly-Plank...

327
00:30:42,189 --> 00:30:44,775
...who'll be taking
Care of Magical Creatures...

328
00:30:44,942 --> 00:30:48,403
...while Professor Hagrid
is on temporary leave.

329
00:30:49,238 --> 00:30:53,242
We also wish to welcome our new
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher...

330
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:56,578
...Professor Dolores Umbridge.

331
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,624
And I'm sure you'll all join me
in wishing the professor good luck.

332
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:06,421
Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

333
00:31:17,516 --> 00:31:20,227
She was at my hearing.
She works for Fudge.

334
00:31:20,394 --> 00:31:26,108
Thank you, headmaster,
for those kind words of welcome.

335
00:31:27,484 --> 00:31:31,155
And how lovely to see all your bright...

336
00:31:31,321 --> 00:31:34,158
...happy faces smiling up at me.

337
00:31:34,533 --> 00:31:39,705
I'm sure we're all going
to be very good friends.

338
00:31:39,872 --> 00:31:42,124
- That's likely.
- That's likely.

339
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,921
The Ministry of Magic
has always considered...

340
00:31:48,088 --> 00:31:53,719
...the education of young witches
and wizards to be of vital importance.

341
00:31:54,052 --> 00:31:56,346
Although each headmaster...

342
00:31:56,513 --> 00:32:01,351
...has brought something new
to this historic school...

343
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:09,067
...progress for the sake of progress
must be discouraged.

344
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:13,614
Let us preserve
what must be preserved...

345
00:32:13,781 --> 00:32:17,284
...perfect what can be perfected...

346
00:32:17,451 --> 00:32:24,082
...and prune practices
that ought to be prohibited.

347
00:32:31,131 --> 00:32:35,260
Thank you, Professor Umbridge.
That really was most illuminating.

348
00:32:35,427 --> 00:32:39,765
- Illuminating? What a load of waffle.
- What's it mean?

349
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:42,684
Magic is forbidden in the corridors...

350
00:32:42,851 --> 00:32:46,438
It means the Ministry's
interfering at Hogwarts.

351
00:33:06,208 --> 00:33:07,960
Dean, Seamus.

352
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:10,379
- Good holiday?
- All right.

353
00:33:10,754 --> 00:33:12,965
Better than Seamus', anyway.

354
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:16,635
Me mum didn't want me
to come back this year.

355
00:33:16,802 --> 00:33:20,097
- Why not?
- Let me see. Because of you.

356
00:33:20,514 --> 00:33:23,892
The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot
of things about you and Dumbledore.

357
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:25,394
What, your mum believes them?

358
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,479
Nobody was there
the night Cedric died.

359
00:33:27,646 --> 00:33:30,732
I guess you should read the Prophet,
then, like your stupid mother.

360
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,403
- Don't talk about my mother.
- I'll have a go at anyone calling me a liar.

361
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,072
- What's going on?
- He's mad, is what's going on.

362
00:33:37,239 --> 00:33:40,325
Do you believe the rubbish he's
come out with about You-Know-Who?

363
00:33:40,492 --> 00:33:42,161
Yeah. I do.

364
00:33:43,162 --> 00:33:45,122
Has anyone else
got a problem with Harry?

365
00:33:54,548 --> 00:33:56,968
- You all right?
- Fine.

366
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,929
Seamus was bang out of order, mate.

367
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:04,267
- But he'll come through, you'll see.
- I said, I'm fine, Ron.

368
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:12,358
Right. I'll just leave you
to your thoughts, then.

369
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:41,805
Harry.

370
00:34:57,237 --> 00:34:59,405
Bring it over here. Over here.

371
00:35:00,323 --> 00:35:03,201
Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it.

372
00:35:18,842 --> 00:35:20,260
Good morning, children.

373
00:35:22,262 --> 00:35:27,433
Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations.

374
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,186
O- W-Ls.

375
00:35:30,353 --> 00:35:34,941
More commonly known as OWLs.

376
00:35:35,108 --> 00:35:38,236
Study hard and you will be rewarded.

377
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:43,825
Fail to do so,
and the consequences may be severe.

378
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:54,461
Your previous instruction in this subject
has been disturbingly uneven.

379
00:35:54,627 --> 00:35:56,796
But you'll be pleased to know,
from now on...

380
00:35:56,963 --> 00:36:00,467
...you will be following a carefully
structured, Ministry-approved...

381
00:36:00,633 --> 00:36:03,303
...course of defensive magic. Yes?

382
00:36:04,637 --> 00:36:07,265
There's nothing in here
about using defensive spells?

383
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:08,975
Using spells?

384
00:36:09,142 --> 00:36:12,604
Well, I can't imagine why you would
need to use spells in my classroom.

385
00:36:14,314 --> 00:36:15,899
We're not gonna use magic?

386
00:36:16,065 --> 00:36:21,070
You'll be learning about defensive spells
in a secure, risk-free way.

387
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:23,990
What use is that?
If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free.

388
00:36:24,157 --> 00:36:27,118
Students will raise their hands
when they speak in my class.

389
00:36:30,747 --> 00:36:33,166
It is the view of the Ministry...

390
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,085
...that a theoretical knowledge
will be sufficient...

391
00:36:36,252 --> 00:36:38,213
...to get you through
your examinations...

392
00:36:38,379 --> 00:36:40,840
...which, after all,
is what school is all about.

393
00:36:41,007 --> 00:36:43,802
And how's theory supposed
to prepare us for what's out there?

394
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,012
There is nothing out there, dear.

395
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:49,182
Who do you imagine
wants to attack children like yourself?

396
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:52,644
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe Lord Voldemort.

397
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:07,826
Now, let me make this quite plain.

398
00:37:08,368 --> 00:37:09,828
You have been told...

399
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:15,375
...that a certain dark wizard
is at large once again.

400
00:37:15,542 --> 00:37:20,672
- This is a lie.
- It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him.

401
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:22,465
Detention, Mr. Potter.

402
00:37:22,632 --> 00:37:24,801
Cedric Diggory dropped dead
of his own accord?

403
00:37:24,968 --> 00:37:27,387
Cedric Diggory's death
was a tragic accident.

404
00:37:27,554 --> 00:37:29,722
It was murder. Voldemort killed him.

405
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,391
Enough!

406
00:37:32,058 --> 00:37:33,726
Enough.

407
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:38,231
See me later, Mr. Potter. My office.

408
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,174
Come in.

409
00:38:09,429 --> 00:38:11,347
Good evening, Mr. Potter.

410
00:38:11,973 --> 00:38:13,266
Sit.

411
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:24,861
You're going to be doing some lines
for me today, Mr. Potter.

412
00:38:25,028 --> 00:38:26,905
No, not with your quill.

413
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:30,325
Going to be using
a rather special one of mine.

414
00:38:35,455 --> 00:38:36,873
Now...

415
00:38:37,832 --> 00:38:43,713
...I want you to write,
"I must not tell lies."

416
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:47,675
How many times?

417
00:38:48,134 --> 00:38:52,806
Well, let's say for as long as it takes
for the message to sink in.

418
00:38:54,808 --> 00:38:56,476
You haven't given me any ink.

419
00:38:56,643 --> 00:38:58,144
Oh, you won't need any ink.

420
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:50,865
Yes?

421
00:39:58,205 --> 00:40:01,584
- Nothing.
- That's right.

422
00:40:02,501 --> 00:40:06,464
Because you know, deep down...

423
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,716
...you deserve to be punished.

424
00:40:09,884 --> 00:40:12,052
Don't you, Mr. Potter?

425
00:40:16,265 --> 00:40:17,892
Go on.

426
00:40:26,901 --> 00:40:29,195
- Skiving Snackboxes.
- Sweets that make you ill.

427
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:30,988
Get out of class whenever you like.

428
00:40:31,155 --> 00:40:34,909
Obtain hours of pleasure
from unprofitable boredom.

429
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,244
Care for another?

430
00:40:37,411 --> 00:40:39,955
- I'm not asking you to write all of it.
- Please.

431
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:43,083
I've been busy studying
for these stupid OWL exams.

432
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:45,377
I'll do the introduction. That's all.

433
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:49,298
Hermione, you're honestly the most
wonderful person I've ever met.

434
00:40:49,465 --> 00:40:53,719
- And if I'm ever rude to you again...
- I'll know you've gone back to normal.

435
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:00,851
What's wrong with your hand?

436
00:41:01,393 --> 00:41:02,853
Nothing.

437
00:41:04,104 --> 00:41:06,023
The other hand.

438
00:41:08,526 --> 00:41:10,361
- You've got to tell Dumbledore.
- No.

439
00:41:10,528 --> 00:41:12,738
Dumbledore's got enough
on his mind right now.

440
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:15,032
I don't want to give
Umbridge the satisfaction.

441
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,618
Bloody hell, Harry.
The woman's torturing you.

442
00:41:17,785 --> 00:41:21,747
- If the parents knew about this...
- I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron?

443
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:27,002
Harry, you've got to report this.

444
00:41:27,169 --> 00:41:30,714
- It's perfectly simple. You're being...
- No, it's not.

445
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:33,717
Hermione, whatever this is,
it's not simple.

446
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,804
You don't understand.

447
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,308
Then help us to.

448
00:41:56,031 --> 00:41:57,908
Dear Padfoot...

449
00:41:58,451 --> 00:42:00,161
...I hope you're all right.

450
00:42:00,327 --> 00:42:04,957
It's starting to get colder here.
Winter is definitely on the way.

451
00:42:07,585 --> 00:42:12,339
In spite of being back at Hogwarts,
I feel more alone than ever.

452
00:42:13,174 --> 00:42:16,510
I know you, of all people,
will understand.

453
00:42:50,586 --> 00:42:52,797
Hello, Harry Potter.

454
00:42:55,424 --> 00:43:00,054
- Your feet. Aren't they cold?
- Bit.

455
00:43:00,971 --> 00:43:05,017
Unfortunately, all my shoes
have mysteriously disappeared.

456
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:08,646
I suspect Nargles are behind it.

457
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:18,614
- What are they?
- They're called Thestrals.

458
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:24,370
They're quite gentle, really, but people
avoid them because they're a bit...

459
00:43:27,289 --> 00:43:28,916
Different.

460
00:43:32,044 --> 00:43:34,421
But why can't the others see them?

461
00:43:34,588 --> 00:43:38,092
They can only be seen
by people who've seen death.

462
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,847
So you've known someone
who's died, then?

463
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:44,640
My mum.

464
00:43:45,182 --> 00:43:50,104
She was quite an extraordinary witch,
but she did like to experiment...

465
00:43:50,271 --> 00:43:53,566
...and one day,
one of her spells went badly wrong.

466
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:56,110
- I was 9.
- I'm sorry.

467
00:43:56,694 --> 00:43:58,904
Yes, it was rather horrible.

468
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:04,410
I do feel very sad about it sometimes,
but I've got Dad.

469
00:44:06,621 --> 00:44:09,291
We both believe you, by the way.

470
00:44:12,335 --> 00:44:15,338
That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named
is back, and you fought him...

471
00:44:15,505 --> 00:44:18,633
...and the Ministry and the Prophet
are conspiring against you.

472
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:23,138
Thanks. It seems you're about
the only ones that do.

473
00:44:23,305 --> 00:44:24,639
I don't think that's true.

474
00:44:27,017 --> 00:44:30,145
But I suppose
that's how he wants you to feel.

475
00:44:30,312 --> 00:44:32,105
What do you mean?

476
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:34,608
Well, if I were You-Know-Who...

477
00:44:35,066 --> 00:44:38,653
...I'd want you to feel cut off
from everyone else...

478
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,531
...because if it's just you alone...

479
00:44:42,365 --> 00:44:44,701
...you're not as much of a threat.

480
00:45:02,344 --> 00:45:07,098
- Do you ever stop eating?
- What? I'm hungry.

481
00:45:10,477 --> 00:45:11,520
Harry.

482
00:45:13,355 --> 00:45:14,606
Can I join you?

483
00:45:16,525 --> 00:45:19,653
Pardon me, professor,
but what exactly are you insinuating?

484
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,572
I am merely requesting
that when it comes to my students...

485
00:45:22,739 --> 00:45:27,035
...you conform to the prescribed
disciplinary practices.

486
00:45:27,202 --> 00:45:28,870
So silly of me, but it sounds...

487
00:45:29,037 --> 00:45:33,166
...as if you're questioning my authority
in my own classroom...

488
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,668
...Minerva.

489
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:39,297
Not at all, Dolores,
merely your medieval methods.

490
00:45:39,548 --> 00:45:42,050
I am sorry, dear.

491
00:45:42,217 --> 00:45:45,554
But to question my practices
is to question the Ministry...

492
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:48,849
...and by extension,
the minister himself.

493
00:45:49,015 --> 00:45:50,600
I am a tolerant woman...

494
00:45:50,767 --> 00:45:55,856
...but the one thing
I will not stand for is disloyalty.

495
00:45:57,607 --> 00:45:59,401
Disloyalty.

496
00:46:01,111 --> 00:46:05,073
Things at Hogwarts
are far worse than I feared.

497
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,743
Cornelius will want
to take immediate action.

498
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:22,048
What's happened to Dumbledore?

499
00:46:22,215 --> 00:46:24,759
Having already revolutionized...

500
00:46:24,926 --> 00:46:27,596
...the teaching
of Defense Against the Dark Arts...

501
00:46:29,264 --> 00:46:32,767
...Dolores Umbridge will,
as high inquisitor, have powers...

502
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:39,441
...to address the seriously falling
standards at Hogwarts School.

503
00:46:47,199 --> 00:46:49,367
Just one question, dear.

504
00:46:49,534 --> 00:46:53,747
You've been in this post
how long, exactly?

505
00:47:00,545 --> 00:47:05,634
You applied first for the Defense Against
the Dark Arts post, is that correct?

506
00:47:05,801 --> 00:47:07,803
Yes.

507
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:10,847
But you were unsuccessful?

508
00:47:12,057 --> 00:47:14,476
Obviously.

509
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:50,262
Could you please predict something
for me?

510
00:47:52,013 --> 00:47:53,181
I'm sorry?

511
00:47:58,436 --> 00:48:00,647
Move those mouths.

512
00:48:06,778 --> 00:48:09,865
One teensy little prophecy?

513
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:17,205
Pity.

514
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:20,167
No, wait. Wait, no.
I think I do see something.

515
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,544
Yes, I do. Something dark.

516
00:48:22,794 --> 00:48:27,340
You are in grave danger.

517
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,552
Lovely.

518
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:42,898
Cho. What's going on?

519
00:48:43,064 --> 00:48:45,400
It's Professor Trelawney.

520
00:49:15,223 --> 00:49:18,726
Sixteen years I've lived
and taught here.

521
00:49:18,893 --> 00:49:21,813
Hogwarts is my home.

522
00:49:23,731 --> 00:49:25,608
You can't do this.

523
00:49:27,068 --> 00:49:29,320
Actually, I can.

524
00:49:38,204 --> 00:49:39,580
Something you'd like to say?

525
00:49:39,747 --> 00:49:42,416
Oh, there are several things
I would like to say.

526
00:49:42,959 --> 00:49:44,544
There...

527
00:49:58,474 --> 00:50:03,146
Professor McGonagall, might I ask you
to escort Sybil back inside?

528
00:50:04,438 --> 00:50:06,899
Sybil, dear. This way.

529
00:50:07,066 --> 00:50:08,568
Thank you.

530
00:50:09,735 --> 00:50:13,781
Dumbledore, may I remind you
that under the terms...

531
00:50:13,948 --> 00:50:17,201
...of Educational Decree Number 23,
as enacted by the minister...

532
00:50:17,368 --> 00:50:20,538
You have the right
to dismiss my teachers.

533
00:50:20,705 --> 00:50:24,292
You do not, however, have the authority
to banish them from the grounds.

534
00:50:24,459 --> 00:50:27,503
That power remains
with the headmaster.

535
00:50:29,505 --> 00:50:30,756
For now.

536
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,182
Don't you all have studying to do?

537
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:40,516
Professor.

538
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:43,478
Professor?

539
00:50:43,936 --> 00:50:46,731
Professor Dumbledore. Professor!

540
00:50:46,898 --> 00:50:49,025
Professor Dumbledore.

541
00:50:59,702 --> 00:51:01,829
That foul, evil, old gargoyle.

542
00:51:02,371 --> 00:51:04,540
We're not learning
how to defend ourselves.

543
00:51:04,707 --> 00:51:07,376
We're not learning
how to pass our OWLs.

544
00:51:07,752 --> 00:51:09,796
She's taking over the entire school.

545
00:51:09,962 --> 00:51:14,634
Security has been and will remain
the Ministry's top priority.

546
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:17,637
Furthermore,
we have convincing evidence...

547
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:20,681
...that these disappearances
are the work...

548
00:51:20,848 --> 00:51:24,227
...of notorious
mass murderer Sirius Black.

549
00:51:24,977 --> 00:51:26,562
Harry.

550
00:51:26,771 --> 00:51:28,481
Sirius.

551
00:51:29,232 --> 00:51:31,901
- What are you doing here?
- Answering your letter.

552
00:51:32,068 --> 00:51:34,987
You said you were worried
about Umbridge. What's she doing?

553
00:51:35,154 --> 00:51:37,073
Training you to kill half-breeds?

554
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:40,243
- She's not letting us use magic at all.
- Well, I'm not surprised.

555
00:51:40,576 --> 00:51:44,622
The latest intelligence is that Fudge
doesn't want you trained in combat.

556
00:51:44,789 --> 00:51:45,832
Combat?

557
00:51:46,332 --> 00:51:49,252
What does he think,
we're forming some sort of wizard army?

558
00:51:49,418 --> 00:51:50,795
That's exactly what he thinks.

559
00:51:50,962 --> 00:51:54,924
That Dumbledore is assembling
his own forces to take on the Ministry.

560
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:58,761
He's becoming more paranoid
by the minute.

561
00:51:59,095 --> 00:52:02,598
The others wouldn't want me
telling you this, Harry...

562
00:52:03,099 --> 00:52:05,935
...but things aren't going at all well
with the Order.

563
00:52:06,102 --> 00:52:08,771
Fudge is blocking the truth
at every turn...

564
00:52:08,938 --> 00:52:12,942
...and these disappearances
are just how it started before.

565
00:52:13,734 --> 00:52:17,071
Voldemort is on the move.

566
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:18,865
Well, what can we do?

567
00:52:19,449 --> 00:52:20,908
Someone's coming.

568
00:52:21,075 --> 00:52:23,286
I'm sorry I can't be of more help.

569
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:28,458
But for now, at least,
it looks like you're on your own.

570
00:52:39,969 --> 00:52:42,305
He really is out there, isn't he?

571
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,809
We've got to be able
to defend ourselves.

572
00:52:47,393 --> 00:52:51,147
And if Umbridge refuses to teach us
how, we need someone who will.

573
00:53:08,164 --> 00:53:10,333
Harry.

574
00:53:19,926 --> 00:53:22,303
This is mad.
Who'd wanna be taught by me?

575
00:53:22,470 --> 00:53:23,679
I'm a nutter, remember?

576
00:53:23,846 --> 00:53:28,351
Look on the bright side: You can't be
any worse than old toad face.

577
00:53:28,601 --> 00:53:32,063
- Thanks, Ron.
- I'm here for you, mate.

578
00:53:32,563 --> 00:53:34,899
Who's supposed to be meeting us, then?

579
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:37,193
Just a couple of people.

580
00:53:42,198 --> 00:53:43,658
Lovely spot.

581
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:49,497
Thought it would be safer
off the beaten track.

582
00:53:49,664 --> 00:53:51,833
Matey, come back here.

583
00:54:00,258 --> 00:54:01,425
Hi.

584
00:54:01,843 --> 00:54:04,720
So you all know why we're here.

585
00:54:04,887 --> 00:54:06,139
We need a teacher.

586
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,017
A proper teacher.

587
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:13,479
One who's had experience defending
themselves against the Dark Arts.

588
00:54:13,646 --> 00:54:15,399
- Why?
- Why?

589
00:54:15,566 --> 00:54:17,651
Because You-Know-Who's back,
you tosspot.

590
00:54:17,818 --> 00:54:19,403
- So he says.
- So Dumbledore says.

591
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,697
So Dumbledore says because he says.

592
00:54:21,864 --> 00:54:24,241
The point is, where's the proof?

593
00:54:25,617 --> 00:54:28,662
If Potter could tell us more
about how Diggory got killed...

594
00:54:31,748 --> 00:54:35,544
I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if
that's why you're here, clear out now.

595
00:54:35,711 --> 00:54:39,131
Come on, Hermione. They're here
because they think I'm some freak.

596
00:54:39,298 --> 00:54:41,925
Is it true you can produce
a Patronus Charm?

597
00:54:45,262 --> 00:54:46,680
Yes.

598
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:49,600
I've seen it.

599
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,894
Blimey, Harry.
I didn't know you could do that.

600
00:54:52,561 --> 00:54:56,690
And he killed a basilisk, with the sword
in Dumbledore's office.

601
00:54:56,857 --> 00:54:58,108
It's true.

602
00:54:58,275 --> 00:55:01,028
Third year, he fought off
about a hundred Dementors at once.

603
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:05,115
Last year, he really did fight off
You-Know-Who in the flesh.

604
00:55:05,282 --> 00:55:06,617
Wait.

605
00:55:07,284 --> 00:55:11,830
Look, it all sounds great
when you say it like that...

606
00:55:11,997 --> 00:55:15,584
...but the truth is,
most of that was just luck.

607
00:55:15,834 --> 00:55:19,588
I didn't know what I was doing
half the time. I nearly always had help.

608
00:55:19,755 --> 00:55:23,258
- He's just being modest.
- No, Hermione, I'm not.

609
00:55:25,803 --> 00:55:30,474
Facing this stuff in real life
is not like school.

610
00:55:31,517 --> 00:55:34,978
In school, if you make a mistake,
you can just try again tomorrow.

611
00:55:35,145 --> 00:55:36,647
But out there...

612
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:40,526
...when you're a second away
from being murdered...

613
00:55:40,692 --> 00:55:44,404
...or watching a friend die
right before your eyes...

614
00:55:47,157 --> 00:55:48,992
You don't know what that's like.

615
00:55:58,752 --> 00:56:00,671
You're right, Harry, we don't.

616
00:56:01,421 --> 00:56:03,507
That's why we need your help.

617
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:06,593
Because if we're going to have
any chance at beating...

618
00:56:08,804 --> 00:56:09,972
...Voldemort...

619
00:56:13,392 --> 00:56:15,144
He's really back.

620
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:39,126
Right. First we need to find
a place to practice...

621
00:56:39,293 --> 00:56:40,711
...where Umbridge won't find out.

622
00:56:40,878 --> 00:56:43,046
- The Shrieking Shack.
- It's too small.

623
00:56:43,213 --> 00:56:46,175
- Forbidden Forest?
- Not bloody likely.

624
00:56:46,341 --> 00:56:48,427
Harry, what happens
if Umbridge does find out?

625
00:56:48,594 --> 00:56:49,761
Who cares?

626
00:56:50,387 --> 00:56:55,225
I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it,
breaking the rules?

627
00:56:55,392 --> 00:56:57,686
Who are you and what have you done
with Hermione?

628
00:56:58,395 --> 00:57:02,065
Anyway, at least we know
one positive thing that came from today.

629
00:57:02,232 --> 00:57:03,525
What's that?

630
00:57:05,235 --> 00:57:07,905
Cho couldn't take her eyes off you,
could she?

631
00:57:10,657 --> 00:57:13,744
Right. Over the next few days,
we should each come up...

632
00:57:13,911 --> 00:57:16,747
...with a couple of possibilities
of places we can practice.

633
00:57:16,914 --> 00:57:20,751
We've got to make sure, wherever it is,
there's no chance she can find us.

634
00:57:20,918 --> 00:57:22,753
Will do, Harry.

635
00:57:31,470 --> 00:57:35,599
All student organizations
are henceforth disbanded.

636
00:57:35,766 --> 00:57:39,394
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

637
00:57:39,603 --> 00:57:42,064
Watch where you're going,
Longbottom.

638
00:58:17,766 --> 00:58:22,020
You've done it, Neville.
You found the Room of Requirement.

639
00:58:22,187 --> 00:58:23,313
The what?

640
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,899
It's also known as
the Come and Go Room.

641
00:58:26,066 --> 00:58:29,486
The Room of Requirement only appears
when a person has real need of it.

642
00:58:29,653 --> 00:58:32,322
And it's always equipped
for the seeker's needs.

643
00:58:32,489 --> 00:58:36,243
So say you really needed the toilet...

644
00:58:37,411 --> 00:58:42,249
Charming, Ronald.
But, yes, that is the general idea.

645
00:58:42,416 --> 00:58:47,296
It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts
wants us to fight back.

646
00:58:58,348 --> 00:58:59,850
Expelliarmus.

647
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,356
I'm hopeless.

648
00:59:06,523 --> 00:59:10,319
You're just flourishing your wand
too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus.

649
00:59:13,697 --> 00:59:17,701
You will please copy
the approved text four times...

650
00:59:17,868 --> 00:59:20,872
...to ensure maximum retention.

651
00:59:21,247 --> 00:59:24,959
- There will be no need to talk.
- No need to think's more like it.

652
00:59:25,126 --> 00:59:27,170
- Expelliarmus.
- Wands away.

653
00:59:40,099 --> 00:59:43,186
Stunning is one of the most useful spells
in your arsenal.

654
00:59:43,353 --> 00:59:45,563
It's a wizard's bread and butter, really.

655
00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:49,317
So come on, then, Nigel.
Give it your best shot.

656
00:59:55,824 --> 00:59:57,242
Stupefy!

657
01:00:02,122 --> 01:00:06,584
Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done.

658
01:00:11,923 --> 01:00:14,050
Don't worry. I'll go easy on you.

659
01:00:14,425 --> 01:00:16,427
Thanks, Ronald.

660
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:21,266
- Come on, Ron.
- Come on, Ron.

661
01:00:21,432 --> 01:00:24,310
- You can do it.
- Come on, Ron.

662
01:00:24,853 --> 01:00:26,896
- One Sickle.
- You're on.

663
01:00:33,945 --> 01:00:35,280
Stupefy.

664
01:00:40,952 --> 01:00:42,954
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

665
01:00:43,329 --> 01:00:47,959
I let her do that.
It's good manners, isn't it?

666
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:52,714
It was completely intentional.

667
01:01:18,323 --> 01:01:21,284
Up you come.
Would you like a cup of tea?

668
01:01:23,578 --> 01:01:27,540
Now, focus on a fixed point
and try again.

669
01:01:28,124 --> 01:01:30,084
Expelliarmus.

670
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:34,214
Very good. Keep your concentration.

671
01:01:36,341 --> 01:01:37,842
Great.

672
01:01:39,093 --> 01:01:40,678
A little higher.

673
01:01:49,187 --> 01:01:52,023
I'm okay. I'm okay.

674
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,669
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

675
01:02:14,212 --> 01:02:17,590
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

676
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:20,635
...may sign up
in the high inquisitor's office.

677
01:02:20,802 --> 01:02:22,428
Diminuendo.

678
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:32,647
Working hard is important, but there's
something that matters even more:

679
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:35,024
Believing in yourself.

680
01:02:35,191 --> 01:02:37,318
- Expelliarmus.
- Levicorpus. Got it.

681
01:02:37,485 --> 01:02:39,070
Think of it this way.

682
01:02:39,237 --> 01:02:43,241
Every great wizard in history
has started out...

683
01:02:43,575 --> 01:02:47,454
...as nothing more
than what we are now: Students.

684
01:02:47,620 --> 01:02:50,582
If they can do it, why not us?

685
01:03:00,717 --> 01:03:02,510
- Stupefy.
- Expelliarmus.

686
01:03:04,679 --> 01:03:06,055
Expelliarmus.

687
01:03:08,766 --> 01:03:10,268
Expelliarmus.

688
01:03:15,774 --> 01:03:17,108
Reducto.

689
01:03:30,622 --> 01:03:33,625
- Expelliarmus.
- Expelliarmus.

690
01:03:33,792 --> 01:03:36,127
Expelliarmus.

691
01:03:40,048 --> 01:03:42,133
Expelliarmus.

692
01:03:45,970 --> 01:03:49,349
Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man.

693
01:03:50,975 --> 01:03:53,144
So that's it for this lesson.

694
01:03:53,311 --> 01:03:56,689
Now, we're not gonna be meeting again
until after the holidays.

695
01:03:57,107 --> 01:04:00,151
So just keep practicing on your own
as best you can.

696
01:04:00,318 --> 01:04:03,655
And well done, everyone.
Great, great work.

697
01:04:08,493 --> 01:04:09,911
Well done, mate.

698
01:04:10,078 --> 01:04:11,496
Thanks.

699
01:04:17,168 --> 01:04:19,546
See you after Christmas.

700
01:04:29,014 --> 01:04:31,058
See you in the Common Room, Harry.

701
01:04:32,476 --> 01:04:35,187
- Thanks a lot, Harry.
- No worries.

702
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:39,316
- Thank you so much.
- Not at all. Merry Christmas.

703
01:04:39,775 --> 01:04:42,153
- Thank you, Harry.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

704
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,196
- Merry Christmas.
- Have a good Christmas.

705
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:46,949
- Have a great Christmas, Luna.
- We've been thinking.

706
01:04:47,116 --> 01:04:49,535
We could always slip Umbridge
some Puking Pastilles.

707
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:52,371
Or Fever Fudge. They give you
massive, pus-filled boils...

708
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:55,040
Sounds great, guys.
Would you excuse me?

709
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:10,723
Are you all right? I heard Umbridge
gave you a rough time the other day.

710
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:13,267
Yeah. I'm okay.

711
01:05:13,976 --> 01:05:16,770
Anyway, it's worth it.

712
01:05:22,109 --> 01:05:25,279
It's just, learning all this...

713
01:05:26,071 --> 01:05:29,533
...makes me wonder whether,
if he'd known it...

714
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:32,411
Cedric did know this stuff.

715
01:05:32,995 --> 01:05:35,414
He was really good.

716
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,751
It's just, Voldemort was better.

717
01:05:43,297 --> 01:05:45,090
You're a really good teacher, Harry.

718
01:05:46,383 --> 01:05:49,261
I've never been able
to stun anything before.

719
01:05:58,437 --> 01:06:00,106
Mistletoe.

720
01:06:03,609 --> 01:06:05,528
Probably full of Nargles, though.

721
01:06:06,612 --> 01:06:08,280
What are Nargles?

722
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:10,741
No idea.

723
01:06:32,763 --> 01:06:34,974
Well, how was it?

724
01:06:35,724 --> 01:06:37,476
Wet.

725
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:39,645
I mean, she was sort of crying.

726
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,981
That bad at it, are you?

727
01:06:42,148 --> 01:06:44,900
I'm sure Harry's kissing
was more than satisfactory.

728
01:06:47,736 --> 01:06:49,905
Cho spends half her time
crying these days.

729
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:52,324
You'd think a bit of snogging
would cheer her up.

730
01:06:53,826 --> 01:06:56,662
Don't you understand
how she must be feeling?

731
01:07:01,083 --> 01:07:04,545
Well, obviously
she's feeling sad about Cedric...

732
01:07:04,712 --> 01:07:07,798
...and confused about liking Harry
and guilty about kissing him...

733
01:07:07,965 --> 01:07:11,177
...conflicted because Umbridge might
sack her mum from the Ministry...

734
01:07:11,343 --> 01:07:15,097
...and frightened of failing her OWLs
because she's worrying about everything.

735
01:07:17,016 --> 01:07:20,603
One person couldn't feel all that.
They'd explode.

736
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:24,023
Just because you've got
the emotional range of a teaspoon...

737
01:07:39,997 --> 01:07:41,540
Harry.

738
01:07:50,299 --> 01:07:53,385
Voldemort may be after something.

739
01:07:54,053 --> 01:07:57,056
Something he didn't have last time.

740
01:07:57,890 --> 01:07:59,141
Harry.

741
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:02,019
Harry.

742
01:08:33,134 --> 01:08:36,554
In the dream,
were you standing next to the victim...

743
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,222
...or looking down at the scene?

744
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,642
Neither. It was like I...

745
01:08:42,226 --> 01:08:44,311
Will you please just tell me
what's happening?

746
01:08:44,478 --> 01:08:46,814
Everard, Arthur's on guard duty
tonight.

747
01:08:46,981 --> 01:08:49,358
Make sure he's found
by the right people.

748
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:51,152
- Sir.
- Phineas.

749
01:08:51,318 --> 01:08:53,612
You must go to your portrait
at Grimmauld Place.

750
01:08:53,779 --> 01:08:56,407
Tell them that Arthur Weasley
is gravely injured...

751
01:08:56,574 --> 01:09:00,744
...and his children will be arriving there
soon by Portkey.

752
01:09:00,911 --> 01:09:03,998
They've got him, Albus. It was close,
but they think he'll make it.

753
01:09:04,165 --> 01:09:06,625
What's more,
the Dark Lord failed to acquire it.

754
01:09:06,834 --> 01:09:08,752
Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to...

755
01:09:08,919 --> 01:09:10,129
Look at me!

756
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:18,846
What's happening to me?

757
01:09:26,729 --> 01:09:28,607
You wished to see me, headmaster?

758
01:09:28,774 --> 01:09:33,695
Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait.
Not even till the morning.

759
01:09:34,070 --> 01:09:36,990
Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable.

760
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:43,371
It appears there's a connection...

761
01:09:43,538 --> 01:09:45,874
...between the Dark Lord's mind
and your own.

762
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:50,212
Whether he is, as yet, aware of this
connection is, for the moment, unclear.

763
01:09:50,545 --> 01:09:53,590
Pray he remains ignorant.

764
01:09:53,757 --> 01:09:57,052
You mean, if he knows about it, then...

765
01:09:57,511 --> 01:10:01,890
...he'll be able to read my mind?
- Read it, control it...

766
01:10:02,057 --> 01:10:03,934
...unhinge it.

767
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,479
In the past, it was often
the Dark Lord's pleasure...

768
01:10:07,646 --> 01:10:09,898
...to invade the minds of his victims...

769
01:10:10,065 --> 01:10:13,652
...creating visions designed
to torture them into madness.

770
01:10:14,778 --> 01:10:19,574
Only after extracting the last exquisite
ounce of agony...

771
01:10:19,741 --> 01:10:24,037
...only when he had them literally
begging for death, would he finally...

772
01:10:24,204 --> 01:10:25,372
...kill them.

773
01:10:26,414 --> 01:10:28,792
Used properly,
the power of Occlumency...

774
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:32,504
...will help shield you
from access or influence.

775
01:10:32,671 --> 01:10:37,425
In these lessons, I will attempt
to penetrate your mind.

776
01:10:38,009 --> 01:10:41,096
You will attempt to resist.

777
01:10:41,388 --> 01:10:42,848
Prepare yourself.

778
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:46,810
Legilimens.

779
01:10:54,943 --> 01:10:58,530
Concentrate, Potter. Focus.

780
01:11:24,431 --> 01:11:26,057
Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas.

781
01:11:27,267 --> 01:11:29,936
Here we go.

782
01:11:30,103 --> 01:11:32,272
Daddy's back.

783
01:11:35,442 --> 01:11:39,070
Sit down, everybody, sit down.
That's it. Now, presents.

784
01:11:39,237 --> 01:11:43,617
- And a nice big box for Ron.
- Big box for you. And...

785
01:11:46,411 --> 01:11:48,622
Fred and George. Come on, open up.

786
01:11:48,789 --> 01:11:51,082
- I want to see your faces.
- Yes.

787
01:11:51,249 --> 01:11:53,627
- Try it on.
- Thanks, Mum. It's perfect.

788
01:11:53,835 --> 01:11:58,131
- Just what he wanted, actually.
- Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum.

789
01:11:58,298 --> 01:12:01,176
Come on, then, everybody.
Let's clear this away.

790
01:12:01,343 --> 01:12:03,345
Oh, Harry, Harry.

791
01:12:03,512 --> 01:12:05,430
There you are.

792
01:12:06,431 --> 01:12:08,266
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you.

793
01:12:08,850 --> 01:12:10,685
- Lovely to have you with us.
- Thank you.

794
01:12:10,852 --> 01:12:12,854
Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy.

795
01:12:13,021 --> 01:12:14,731
- Thank you.
- Has everybody got?

796
01:12:14,898 --> 01:12:16,274
Fred? George?

797
01:12:16,441 --> 01:12:18,985
- Hermione.
- A Christmas toast.

798
01:12:19,152 --> 01:12:21,029
To Mr. Harry Potter...

799
01:12:22,030 --> 01:12:24,866
...without whom I would not be here.

800
01:12:28,453 --> 01:12:30,789
- Harry.
- Harry.

801
01:12:30,956 --> 01:12:32,207
Harry.

802
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,752
That is delicious.
I shall be needing some more of that.

803
01:12:35,961 --> 01:12:38,338
Daddy, don't forget last Christmas.

804
01:12:39,256 --> 01:12:42,008
I can't understand
why you don't want to wear it, Ronald.

805
01:12:43,468 --> 01:12:45,303
I look like a bloody idiot, that's why.

806
01:12:45,470 --> 01:12:47,305
No more than usual, Ron.

807
01:12:47,514 --> 01:12:49,349
I don't know why...

808
01:12:55,355 --> 01:12:59,943
Nasty brat, standing there
as bold as brass.

809
01:13:00,110 --> 01:13:04,865
Harry Potter,
the boy who stopped the Dark Lord.

810
01:13:05,031 --> 01:13:08,034
Friend of Mudbloods
and blood-traitors alike.

811
01:13:08,452 --> 01:13:11,079
- If my poor mistress only knew...
- Kreacher!

812
01:13:11,246 --> 01:13:14,082
That's enough of your bile.
Away with you!

813
01:13:14,249 --> 01:13:16,251
Of course, master.

814
01:13:16,418 --> 01:13:21,089
Kreacher lives to serve
the noble house of Black.

815
01:13:23,425 --> 01:13:25,302
Sorry about that.

816
01:13:25,886 --> 01:13:29,556
He never was very pleasant,
even when I was a boy.

817
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:31,975
Not to me, anyway.

818
01:13:32,809 --> 01:13:34,769
What, you grew up here?

819
01:13:34,936 --> 01:13:37,189
This is my parents' house.

820
01:13:37,522 --> 01:13:41,359
I offered it to Dumbledore
as headquarters for the Order.

821
01:13:42,486 --> 01:13:45,781
About the only useful thing
I've been able to do.

822
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:49,534
This is the Black family tree.

823
01:13:50,452 --> 01:13:52,579
My deranged cousin.

824
01:13:52,746 --> 01:13:55,457
I hated the lot of them.

825
01:13:55,624 --> 01:14:00,337
My parents with their pure-blood mania.

826
01:14:03,548 --> 01:14:07,344
My mother did that after I ran away.

827
01:14:09,679 --> 01:14:11,556
Charming woman.

828
01:14:12,808 --> 01:14:14,476
I was 16.

829
01:14:15,310 --> 01:14:16,728
Where did you go?

830
01:14:18,814 --> 01:14:20,065
Round your dad's.

831
01:14:21,566 --> 01:14:24,111
I was always welcome at the Potters'.

832
01:14:24,986 --> 01:14:27,739
I see him so much in you, Harry.

833
01:14:28,365 --> 01:14:30,575
You are so very much alike.

834
01:14:31,493 --> 01:14:33,496
I'm not so sure.

835
01:14:34,539 --> 01:14:35,998
Sirius, when I was...

836
01:14:38,835 --> 01:14:43,339
When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked,
I wasn't just watching.

837
01:14:44,507 --> 01:14:46,008
I was the snake.

838
01:14:46,843 --> 01:14:49,804
And afterwards,
in Dumbledore's office...

839
01:14:49,971 --> 01:14:54,183
...there was a moment
when I wanted to...

840
01:14:59,313 --> 01:15:02,191
This connection
between me and Voldemort.

841
01:15:02,859 --> 01:15:06,446
What if the reason for it
is that I am becoming more like him?

842
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:12,702
I just feel so angry all the time.

843
01:15:12,869 --> 01:15:17,415
And what if, after everything
that I've been through...

844
01:15:17,582 --> 01:15:21,169
...something's gone wrong inside me?
What if I'm becoming bad?

845
01:15:23,796 --> 01:15:27,049
I want you to listen to me
very carefully, Harry.

846
01:15:28,217 --> 01:15:31,220
You're not a bad person.

847
01:15:32,054 --> 01:15:36,392
You're a very good person
who bad things have happened to.

848
01:15:37,018 --> 01:15:38,102
You understand?

849
01:15:40,229 --> 01:15:45,276
Besides, the world isn't split
into good people and Death Eaters.

850
01:15:45,443 --> 01:15:49,906
We've all got both light and dark
inside of us.

851
01:15:50,656 --> 01:15:53,910
What matters
is the part we choose to act on.

852
01:15:55,870 --> 01:15:58,164
That's who we really are.

853
01:16:01,918 --> 01:16:03,669
Harry, time to go.

854
01:16:05,421 --> 01:16:09,717
When all this is over,
we'll be a proper family.

855
01:16:09,884 --> 01:16:11,469
You'll see.

856
01:16:12,595 --> 01:16:13,971
Come on.

857
01:16:51,425 --> 01:16:52,593
Really?

858
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,388
Harry. Harry.

859
01:16:55,555 --> 01:16:57,473
Hagrid's back.

860
01:17:00,434 --> 01:17:02,270
I'm sorry.

861
01:17:16,492 --> 01:17:19,662
I will say this one last time.

862
01:17:19,954 --> 01:17:22,331
I'm ordering you to tell me
where you've been.

863
01:17:22,498 --> 01:17:25,501
I told you. I've been away
for me health.

864
01:17:25,835 --> 01:17:30,006
- Your health?
- Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know.

865
01:17:30,173 --> 01:17:35,011
Oh, yes. As gamekeeper,
fresh air must be difficult to come by.

866
01:17:37,054 --> 01:17:39,557
If I were you,
I shouldn't get too used to being back.

867
01:17:39,724 --> 01:17:43,019
In fact, I mightn't bother
unpacking at all.

868
01:18:01,954 --> 01:18:05,041
This is top-secret, right?

869
01:18:05,958 --> 01:18:08,336
Dumbledore sent me
to parley with the giants.

870
01:18:08,503 --> 01:18:10,004
Giants?

871
01:18:11,214 --> 01:18:12,256
You found them?

872
01:18:12,423 --> 01:18:16,260
Well, they're not that hard to find, to be
perfectly honest. They're so big, see?

873
01:18:17,178 --> 01:18:20,223
I tried to convince them
to join the cause.

874
01:18:20,389 --> 01:18:23,059
But I wasn't the only one
that was trying to win them over.

875
01:18:23,768 --> 01:18:25,686
- Death Eaters?
- Yes.

876
01:18:26,145 --> 01:18:29,482
Trying to persuade them
to join You-Know-Who.

877
01:18:29,982 --> 01:18:32,360
- Did they?
- I gave them Dumbledore's message.

878
01:18:32,527 --> 01:18:36,614
Suppose some of them remember
he was friendly to them. I suppose.

879
01:18:40,243 --> 01:18:41,494
And they did this to you?

880
01:18:42,245 --> 01:18:43,996
Not exactly, no.

881
01:18:44,497 --> 01:18:48,417
Oh, go on, you have it, then,
you dozy dog.

882
01:19:02,390 --> 01:19:04,517
It's changing out there.

883
01:19:04,934 --> 01:19:06,519
Just like last time.

884
01:19:07,979 --> 01:19:09,605
There's a storm coming, Harry.

885
01:19:10,356 --> 01:19:13,443
We'd all best be ready when she does.

886
01:19:50,439 --> 01:19:53,484
We have confirmed
that 10 high-security prisoners...

887
01:19:53,650 --> 01:19:56,487
...in the early hours of yesterday evening
did escape.

888
01:19:56,653 --> 01:20:00,324
And of course, the Muggle prime minister
has been alerted to the danger.

889
01:20:00,491 --> 01:20:02,576
We strongly suspect...

890
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:05,412
...that the breakout was engineered...

891
01:20:05,579 --> 01:20:09,792
...by a man with personal experience
in escaping from Azkaban...

892
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:14,171
...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black...

893
01:20:15,631 --> 01:20:20,010
...cousin of escapee
Bellatrix Lestrange.

894
01:20:30,312 --> 01:20:32,606
Dumbledore warned Fudge
this could happen.

895
01:20:32,773 --> 01:20:35,943
He's gonna get us all killed
just because he can't face the truth.

896
01:20:36,110 --> 01:20:37,236
Harry.

897
01:20:40,948 --> 01:20:42,950
I wanted to apologize.

898
01:20:43,534 --> 01:20:47,704
Now even me mum says the Prophet's
version of things don't add up.

899
01:20:47,871 --> 01:20:53,794
So, what I'm really trying to say
is that I believe you.

900
01:21:00,717 --> 01:21:02,344
Neville?

901
01:21:14,898 --> 01:21:17,067
Fourteen years ago...

902
01:21:17,234 --> 01:21:21,488
...a Death Eater
named Bellatrix Lestrange...

903
01:21:21,655 --> 01:21:24,867
...used a Cruciatus Curse
on my parents.

904
01:21:25,409 --> 01:21:29,413
She tortured them for information...

905
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,748
...but they never gave in.

906
01:21:33,417 --> 01:21:35,919
I'm quite proud to be their son.

907
01:21:36,879 --> 01:21:40,716
But I'm not sure I'm ready
for everyone to know just yet.

908
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:50,809
We're gonna make them proud, Neville.
That's a promise.

909
01:21:55,063 --> 01:21:58,734
Make it a powerful memory,
the happiest you can remember.

910
01:21:58,942 --> 01:22:02,362
Allow it to fill you up.
Keep trying, Seamus.

911
01:22:02,529 --> 01:22:03,947
George, your turn now.

912
01:22:05,282 --> 01:22:07,618
Expecto Patronum.

913
01:22:08,535 --> 01:22:11,955
A full-bodied Patronus
is the most difficult to produce...

914
01:22:12,122 --> 01:22:15,959
...but shield forms can also be equally
useful against a variety of opponents.

915
01:22:16,126 --> 01:22:17,377
Wow, that was really good.

916
01:22:18,086 --> 01:22:19,630
Fantastic, Ginny.

917
01:22:19,797 --> 01:22:23,842
Just remember, your Patronus can only
protect you for as long as you stay focused.

918
01:22:24,009 --> 01:22:26,303
So focus, Luna.

919
01:22:30,015 --> 01:22:31,725
Think of the happiest thing you can.

920
01:22:31,892 --> 01:22:33,852
Expecto Patronum.

921
01:22:34,019 --> 01:22:36,897
- I'm trying.
- I know. It's good.

922
01:22:37,064 --> 01:22:41,318
This is really advanced stuff, guys.
You're doing so well.

923
01:22:42,069 --> 01:22:44,446
Expecto Patronum.

924
01:23:26,321 --> 01:23:28,866
I'll make short work of this.

925
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,202
Bombarda Maxima.

926
01:23:50,471 --> 01:23:51,847
Get them.

927
01:23:52,264 --> 01:23:53,724
Been watching them for weeks.

928
01:23:53,891 --> 01:23:55,851
And see, "Dumbledore's Army"...

929
01:23:56,268 --> 01:23:59,938
...proof of what I've been telling you
right from the beginning, Cornelius.

930
01:24:01,356 --> 01:24:03,400
All your fear-mongering
about You-Know-Who...

931
01:24:03,567 --> 01:24:05,110
...never fooled us for a minute.

932
01:24:05,277 --> 01:24:07,362
We saw your lies for what they were:

933
01:24:07,529 --> 01:24:11,283
A smokescreen for your bid
to seize control of the Ministry.

934
01:24:11,492 --> 01:24:12,534
Naturally.

935
01:24:12,701 --> 01:24:15,245
No, professor.
He had nothing to do with it. It was me.

936
01:24:15,412 --> 01:24:19,082
Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me,
but as has been pointed out...

937
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:24,087
...the parchment clearly says
"Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's."

938
01:24:24,254 --> 01:24:26,882
I instructed Harry
to form this organization.

939
01:24:27,049 --> 01:24:30,511
And I, and I alone,
am responsible for its activities.

940
01:24:30,677 --> 01:24:32,513
Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet.

941
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:35,224
If we hurry, we should still make
the morning edition.

942
01:24:35,390 --> 01:24:40,187
Dawlish, Shacklebolt,
you will escort Dumbledore...

943
01:24:40,354 --> 01:24:41,772
...to Azkaban...

944
01:24:43,024 --> 01:24:48,154
...to await trial
for conspiracy and sedition.

945
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:51,282
I thought we might hit this little snag.

946
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:55,912
You seem to be laboring
under the delusion that I'm going to...

947
01:24:56,454 --> 01:24:57,914
What was the phrase?

948
01:24:58,081 --> 01:24:59,666
Come quietly.

949
01:24:59,833 --> 01:25:01,543
Well, I can tell you this:

950
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:04,295
I have no intention
of going to Azkaban.

951
01:25:04,462 --> 01:25:05,713
Enough of this.

952
01:25:06,214 --> 01:25:07,298
Take him.

953
01:25:20,145 --> 01:25:24,524
Well, you may not like him, minister...

954
01:25:24,691 --> 01:25:26,818
...but you can't deny...

955
01:25:27,360 --> 01:25:30,113
...Dumbledore has got style.

956
01:25:54,179 --> 01:25:58,850
Boys and girls are not permitted
to be within eight inches of each other.

957
01:25:59,017 --> 01:26:02,437
Those wishing to join
the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit...

958
01:26:02,604 --> 01:26:07,650
Students will be submitted to questioning
about suspected illicit activities.

959
01:26:07,817 --> 01:26:12,113
Any student in noncompliance
will be expelled.

960
01:27:23,309 --> 01:27:24,936
Harry.

961
01:27:31,860 --> 01:27:35,280
You did everything you could.
No one could win against that old hag.

962
01:27:35,447 --> 01:27:37,782
Even Dumbledore
didn't see this coming.

963
01:27:38,700 --> 01:27:40,869
Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours.

964
01:27:41,035 --> 01:27:43,121
Yeah, we talked you into it.

965
01:27:43,288 --> 01:27:45,290
Yeah, but I agreed.

966
01:27:45,832 --> 01:27:49,961
I tried so hard to help,
and all it's done is make things worse.

967
01:27:52,005 --> 01:27:54,466
Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore.

968
01:27:55,508 --> 01:27:59,721
Because I don't want to play anymore.
All it does is make you care too much.

969
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:02,557
And the more you care,
the more you have to lose.

970
01:28:02,724 --> 01:28:05,894
- So maybe it's just better to...
- To what?

971
01:28:08,146 --> 01:28:10,064
To go it alone.

972
01:28:16,404 --> 01:28:18,072
Hagrid.

973
01:28:21,826 --> 01:28:24,204
Any idea where he's taking us?

974
01:28:24,412 --> 01:28:27,499
Hagrid, why can't you just tell us?

975
01:28:35,799 --> 01:28:38,468
I've never seen the centaurs so riled.

976
01:28:38,635 --> 01:28:41,179
And they're dangerous
at the best of times.

977
01:28:42,138 --> 01:28:44,474
The Ministry restricts
their territory much more...

978
01:28:44,641 --> 01:28:46,851
...they'll have a full uprising
on their hands.

979
01:28:47,018 --> 01:28:48,686
Hagrid, what's going on?

980
01:28:48,853 --> 01:28:51,064
I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three.

981
01:28:51,231 --> 01:28:56,194
I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it,
but with Dumbledore gone...

982
01:28:56,861 --> 01:29:00,031
...I'll likely be getting the sack
any day now.

983
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:03,701
And I just couldn't leave
without telling someone about him.

984
01:29:07,872 --> 01:29:09,541
Grawpy.

985
01:29:11,918 --> 01:29:14,045
Down here, you great buffoon.

986
01:29:20,385 --> 01:29:22,053
Grawpy.

987
01:29:22,846 --> 01:29:24,556
Brought you some company.

988
01:29:36,901 --> 01:29:39,154
I couldn't just leave him, because...

989
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:41,072
Because he's my brother.

990
01:29:41,239 --> 01:29:42,365
Blimey.

991
01:29:42,532 --> 01:29:44,576
Well, half brother, really.

992
01:29:44,742 --> 01:29:49,957
He's completely harmless, just like I said.
Little high-spirited, is all.

993
01:29:52,126 --> 01:29:54,462
- Grawpy, that is not polite.
- Hagrid, do something.

994
01:29:54,628 --> 01:29:57,006
We talked about this.
You do not grab, do you?

995
01:29:57,214 --> 01:29:59,467
That's your new friend, Hermione.

996
01:29:59,633 --> 01:30:00,885
Grawpy.

997
01:30:05,264 --> 01:30:06,432
Grawp.

998
01:30:08,476 --> 01:30:11,562
Put me down.

999
01:30:15,232 --> 01:30:16,776
Now.

1000
01:30:28,954 --> 01:30:30,039
You all right?

1001
01:30:31,332 --> 01:30:33,000
Fine.

1002
01:30:33,417 --> 01:30:35,711
Just needs a firm hand, is all.

1003
01:30:35,878 --> 01:30:38,255
I think you've got an admirer.

1004
01:30:40,800 --> 01:30:42,968
You just stay away from her, all right?

1005
01:31:13,082 --> 01:31:15,835
He gets his own food and all.

1006
01:31:17,086 --> 01:31:20,172
It's company he'll be needing
when I'm gone.

1007
01:31:21,507 --> 01:31:23,717
You will look after him, won't you?

1008
01:31:24,218 --> 01:31:26,929
I'm the only family he's got.

1009
01:31:40,526 --> 01:31:42,361
Feeling sentimental?

1010
01:31:45,656 --> 01:31:49,493
- That's private.
- Not to me.

1011
01:31:49,785 --> 01:31:53,289
And not to the Dark Lord,
if you don't improve.

1012
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:58,878
Every memory he has access to
is a weapon he can use against you.

1013
01:31:59,044 --> 01:32:03,215
You won't last two seconds
if he invades your mind.

1014
01:32:04,383 --> 01:32:06,635
You're just like your father.

1015
01:32:06,802 --> 01:32:08,596
Lazy, arrogant.

1016
01:32:08,762 --> 01:32:11,015
- Don't say a word against my father.
- Weak.

1017
01:32:11,182 --> 01:32:13,350
- I'm not weak.
- Then prove it.

1018
01:32:13,976 --> 01:32:15,895
Control your emotions.

1019
01:32:16,061 --> 01:32:19,023
Discipline your mind.

1020
01:32:21,859 --> 01:32:23,027
Legilimens.

1021
01:32:30,242 --> 01:32:31,368
Harry.

1022
01:32:31,535 --> 01:32:33,245
Sirius.

1023
01:32:33,913 --> 01:32:35,247
I may vomit.

1024
01:32:35,581 --> 01:32:36,624
Stop it.

1025
01:32:37,750 --> 01:32:40,044
Is this what you call control?

1026
01:32:40,544 --> 01:32:43,589
We've been at it for hours.
If I could just rest.

1027
01:32:43,756 --> 01:32:47,176
The Dark Lord isn't resting.

1028
01:32:48,803 --> 01:32:50,721
You and Black, you're two of a kind.

1029
01:32:50,888 --> 01:32:54,809
Sentimental children forever whining
about how unfair your lives have been.

1030
01:32:55,017 --> 01:32:58,395
Well, it may have escaped your notice,
but life isn't fair.

1031
01:32:58,562 --> 01:33:02,483
Your blessed father knew that.
In fact, he frequently saw to it.

1032
01:33:02,691 --> 01:33:05,736
- My father was a great man.
- Your father was a swine.

1033
01:33:06,779 --> 01:33:08,280
- Legilimens.
- Protego.

1034
01:33:13,828 --> 01:33:15,371
Come on, Moony, Padfoot.

1035
01:33:15,538 --> 01:33:17,623
Snape. Expelliarmus.

1036
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:19,625
Nice one, James.

1037
01:33:19,959 --> 01:33:22,294
- Dad.
- Impedimenta.

1038
01:33:22,461 --> 01:33:24,463
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1039
01:33:24,630 --> 01:33:27,299
Right. Who wants to see me
take off Snivelly's trousers?

1040
01:33:27,466 --> 01:33:29,718
Snivellus Greasy.
Snivellus Greasy.

1041
01:33:29,885 --> 01:33:31,095
Enough.

1042
01:33:33,055 --> 01:33:34,640
Enough.

1043
01:33:43,149 --> 01:33:45,776
Your lessons are at an end.

1044
01:33:45,943 --> 01:33:47,027
I...

1045
01:33:47,236 --> 01:33:50,489
Get out.

1046
01:34:07,715 --> 01:34:09,884
- What's your name?
- Michael.

1047
01:34:10,050 --> 01:34:11,969
Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael.

1048
01:34:12,136 --> 01:34:15,181
Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See?

1049
01:34:15,347 --> 01:34:17,349
It's fading already.

1050
01:34:17,516 --> 01:34:22,271
You can hardly see ours anymore,
and the pain stops after a while.

1051
01:34:29,653 --> 01:34:32,364
As I told you once before, Mr. Potter...

1052
01:34:32,531 --> 01:34:36,327
...naughty children
deserve to be punished.

1053
01:34:39,371 --> 01:34:40,706
You know, George...

1054
01:34:40,873 --> 01:34:44,543
...I've always felt our futures lay outside
the world of academic achievement.

1055
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:49,298
Fred, I've been thinking
exactly the same thing.

1056
01:36:01,246 --> 01:36:02,914
All right, professor!

1057
01:36:11,673 --> 01:36:13,467
Here you go.

1058
01:36:38,408 --> 01:36:40,243
Ready when you are.

1059
01:38:05,996 --> 01:38:09,249
I need that prophecy.

1060
01:38:09,416 --> 01:38:11,251
You'll have to kill me.

1061
01:38:12,085 --> 01:38:16,673
Oh, I will.
But first, you will fetch it for me.

1062
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:18,550
Crucio.

1063
01:38:21,094 --> 01:38:22,846
Crucio.

1064
01:38:34,232 --> 01:38:35,692
Sirius.

1065
01:38:35,859 --> 01:38:36,902
Harry, are you sure?

1066
01:38:37,068 --> 01:38:39,488
I saw it. It's just like
with Mr. Weasley.

1067
01:38:39,654 --> 01:38:41,531
It's the door I've been dreaming about.

1068
01:38:41,698 --> 01:38:43,784
I couldn't remember
where I'd seen it before.

1069
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:45,869
Sirius said Voldemort
was after something.

1070
01:38:46,036 --> 01:38:49,331
Something he didn't have the last time,
in the Department of Mysteries.

1071
01:38:49,498 --> 01:38:51,458
Harry, please, just listen.

1072
01:38:52,959 --> 01:38:54,961
What if Voldemort
meant for you to see this?

1073
01:38:56,254 --> 01:38:59,382
What if he's only hurting Sirius
because he's trying to get to you?

1074
01:38:59,549 --> 01:39:03,053
What if he is?
I'm supposed to just let him die?

1075
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:06,723
Hermione,
he's the only family I've got left.

1076
01:39:09,267 --> 01:39:10,268
What do we do?

1077
01:39:11,728 --> 01:39:13,355
We'll have to use the Floo Network.

1078
01:39:13,522 --> 01:39:15,607
Umbridge has the chimneys
under surveillance.

1079
01:39:15,774 --> 01:39:17,317
Not all of them.

1080
01:39:20,153 --> 01:39:21,488
Alohomora.

1081
01:39:32,707 --> 01:39:34,417
Alert the Order if you can.

1082
01:39:34,584 --> 01:39:38,171
- Are you mental? We're going with you.
- It's too dangerous.

1083
01:39:38,338 --> 01:39:41,967
When are you going to get it
into your head? We're in this together.

1084
01:39:42,134 --> 01:39:45,345
That you are.

1085
01:39:45,512 --> 01:39:48,390
Caught this one
trying to help the Weasley girl.

1086
01:39:53,395 --> 01:39:55,522
You were going to Dumbledore,
weren't you?

1087
01:39:55,689 --> 01:39:57,692
- No.
- Liar.

1088
01:39:57,859 --> 01:40:00,695
- You sent for me, headmistress?
- Snape, yes.

1089
01:40:00,862 --> 01:40:04,365
The time has come for answers, whether
he wants to give them to me or not.

1090
01:40:04,782 --> 01:40:06,325
Have you brought the Veritaserum?

1091
01:40:06,492 --> 01:40:09,370
I'm afraid you've used up
all my stores interrogating students.

1092
01:40:09,537 --> 01:40:12,707
The last of it on Miss Chang.

1093
01:40:16,752 --> 01:40:18,212
Unless you wish to poison him...

1094
01:40:18,379 --> 01:40:22,842
And I assure you, I would have
the greatest sympathy if you did.

1095
01:40:23,426 --> 01:40:25,386
I cannot help you.

1096
01:40:27,805 --> 01:40:29,515
He's got Padfoot.

1097
01:40:30,558 --> 01:40:34,061
He's got Padfoot at the place
where it's hidden.

1098
01:40:34,520 --> 01:40:36,647
Padfoot? What is Padfoot?
Where what is hidden?

1099
01:40:36,814 --> 01:40:38,357
What is he talking about, Snape?

1100
01:40:45,031 --> 01:40:47,033
No idea.

1101
01:40:51,537 --> 01:40:53,080
Very well.

1102
01:40:54,081 --> 01:40:56,417
You give me no choice, Potter.

1103
01:40:56,793 --> 01:40:59,754
As this is an issue
of Ministry security...

1104
01:40:59,921 --> 01:41:02,006
...you leave me with...

1105
01:41:02,757 --> 01:41:04,717
...no alternative.

1106
01:41:05,510 --> 01:41:07,720
The Cruciatus Curse
ought to loosen your tongue.

1107
01:41:07,887 --> 01:41:08,888
That's illegal.

1108
01:41:09,096 --> 01:41:12,433
What Cornelius doesn't know
won't hurt him.

1109
01:41:19,941 --> 01:41:21,442
Tell her, Harry!

1110
01:41:22,944 --> 01:41:24,403
Tell me what?

1111
01:41:25,613 --> 01:41:27,615
Well, if you won't tell her where it is...

1112
01:41:28,282 --> 01:41:30,034
...I will.

1113
01:41:31,661 --> 01:41:33,454
Where what is?

1114
01:41:34,664 --> 01:41:36,958
Dumbledore's secret weapon.

1115
01:41:41,963 --> 01:41:43,506
How much further?

1116
01:41:43,673 --> 01:41:45,341
Not far.

1117
01:41:47,343 --> 01:41:51,013
It had to be somewhere
students wouldn't find it accidentally.

1118
01:41:55,393 --> 01:41:56,853
What are you doing?

1119
01:41:57,019 --> 01:41:58,813
Improvising.

1120
01:42:07,321 --> 01:42:08,948
Well?

1121
01:42:10,241 --> 01:42:12,368
Where is this weapon?

1122
01:42:17,290 --> 01:42:19,542
There isn't one, is there?

1123
01:42:22,336 --> 01:42:24,505
You were trying to trick me.

1124
01:42:28,676 --> 01:42:30,261
You know...

1125
01:42:31,679 --> 01:42:33,681
...I really hate children.

1126
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:53,701
You have no business here, centaur.
This is a Ministry matter.

1127
01:42:56,370 --> 01:42:58,039
Lower your weapons.

1128
01:42:58,206 --> 01:43:03,753
I warn you, under the law, as
creatures of near-human intelligence...

1129
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:05,171
Protego.

1130
01:43:05,421 --> 01:43:06,506
How dare you?

1131
01:43:07,215 --> 01:43:08,716
Filthy half-breed.

1132
01:43:09,467 --> 01:43:10,510
Incarcerous.

1133
01:43:23,731 --> 01:43:26,275
Please. Please stop it. Please.

1134
01:43:26,484 --> 01:43:31,155
Now, enough. I will have order.

1135
01:43:39,997 --> 01:43:42,542
You filthy animal.

1136
01:43:42,750 --> 01:43:45,711
Do you know who I am?

1137
01:43:45,878 --> 01:43:48,714
Leave him alone. It's not his fault.

1138
01:43:48,881 --> 01:43:50,758
No, he doesn't understand.

1139
01:43:58,433 --> 01:44:01,894
Potter, do something.
Tell them I mean no harm.

1140
01:44:02,061 --> 01:44:03,980
I'm sorry, professor.

1141
01:44:04,147 --> 01:44:05,940
But I must not tell lies.

1142
01:44:06,107 --> 01:44:07,150
What are you doing?

1143
01:44:07,316 --> 01:44:11,070
I am Senior Undersecretary
Dolores Jane Umbridge.

1144
01:44:11,612 --> 01:44:13,781
Let me go!

1145
01:44:16,451 --> 01:44:18,286
Thank you, Grawp.

1146
01:44:18,453 --> 01:44:21,956
Hermione. Hermione, Sirius.

1147
01:44:30,214 --> 01:44:33,801
- How'd you get away?
- Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty.

1148
01:44:33,968 --> 01:44:36,095
Told them I was hungry,
wanted some sweets.

1149
01:44:36,262 --> 01:44:38,806
They told me to bugger off
and ate the lot themselves.

1150
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:41,142
That was clever, Ron.

1151
01:44:41,976 --> 01:44:44,437
- Has been known to happen.
- It was brilliant.

1152
01:44:44,645 --> 01:44:46,481
So how are we getting to London?

1153
01:44:47,815 --> 01:44:51,360
Look, it's not that I don't appreciate
everything you've done, all of you...

1154
01:44:52,195 --> 01:44:54,906
...but I've got you
into enough trouble as it is.

1155
01:44:55,072 --> 01:44:58,034
Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be
about doing something real.

1156
01:44:58,367 --> 01:45:00,495
Or was that all just words to you?

1157
01:45:02,372 --> 01:45:05,584
Maybe you don't have to do this
all by yourself, mate.

1158
01:45:10,506 --> 01:45:12,633
So how are we going to get to London?

1159
01:45:14,051 --> 01:45:16,303
We fly, of course.

1160
01:46:07,354 --> 01:46:09,523
Department of Mysteries.

1161
01:46:18,365 --> 01:46:20,075
This is it.

1162
01:47:13,045 --> 01:47:15,339
Ninety-two. Ninety-three.

1163
01:47:17,090 --> 01:47:18,467
Ninety-four.

1164
01:47:19,718 --> 01:47:20,719
Ninety-five.

1165
01:47:33,315 --> 01:47:36,068
- He should be here.
- Harry.

1166
01:47:38,779 --> 01:47:40,030
It's got your name on it.

1167
01:48:05,264 --> 01:48:09,643
The one with the power
to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches.

1168
01:48:10,477 --> 01:48:12,855
And the Dark Lord
shall mark him as his equal...

1169
01:48:13,063 --> 01:48:15,858
...but he shall have power
the Dark Lord knows not.

1170
01:48:21,530 --> 01:48:26,869
For neither can live
while the other survives.

1171
01:48:29,371 --> 01:48:30,456
Harry.

1172
01:48:40,966 --> 01:48:42,468
Where's Sirius?

1173
01:48:42,634 --> 01:48:47,681
You know, you really should learn
to tell the difference between dreams...

1174
01:48:50,642 --> 01:48:52,770
...and reality.

1175
01:48:54,062 --> 01:48:59,026
You saw only what the Dark Lord
wanted you to see.

1176
01:48:59,735 --> 01:49:01,236
Now, hand me the prophecy.

1177
01:49:01,403 --> 01:49:03,489
If you do anything to us, I'll break it.

1178
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:08,786
He knows how to play.

1179
01:49:08,994 --> 01:49:12,748
Itty, bitty baby.

1180
01:49:12,956 --> 01:49:14,208
Potter.

1181
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:16,627
Bellatrix Lestrange.

1182
01:49:16,794 --> 01:49:19,755
Neville Longbottom, is it?
How's Mum and Dad?

1183
01:49:19,922 --> 01:49:21,757
Better, now they're
about to be avenged.

1184
01:49:24,593 --> 01:49:29,389
Now, let's everybody
just calm down...

1185
01:49:29,890 --> 01:49:31,391
...shall we?

1186
01:49:31,558 --> 01:49:34,019
All we want is that prophecy.

1187
01:49:34,186 --> 01:49:36,396
Why did Voldemort
need me to come and get this?

1188
01:49:36,563 --> 01:49:38,190
You dare speak his name?

1189
01:49:39,733 --> 01:49:41,318
You filthy half-blood!

1190
01:49:41,485 --> 01:49:44,113
It's all right.
He's just a curious lad, aren't you?

1191
01:49:46,031 --> 01:49:51,495
Prophecies can only be retrieved
by those about whom they are made.

1192
01:49:51,662 --> 01:49:54,414
Which is lucky for you, really.

1193
01:49:58,168 --> 01:50:00,129
Haven't you always wondered...

1194
01:50:00,629 --> 01:50:05,759
...the reason for the connection
between you and the Dark Lord?

1195
01:50:06,553 --> 01:50:09,013
Why he was unable to kill you...

1196
01:50:09,222 --> 01:50:11,766
...when you were just an infant?

1197
01:50:13,143 --> 01:50:17,939
Don't you want to know
the secret of your scar?

1198
01:50:18,857 --> 01:50:23,278
All the answers are there, Potter,
in your hand.

1199
01:50:24,487 --> 01:50:26,489
All you have to do...

1200
01:50:27,031 --> 01:50:28,992
...is give it to me.

1201
01:50:29,284 --> 01:50:32,579
Then I can show you everything.

1202
01:50:41,337 --> 01:50:43,131
I've waited 14 years.

1203
01:50:43,715 --> 01:50:44,966
I know.

1204
01:50:46,342 --> 01:50:49,262
I guess I can wait a little longer.
Now. Stupefy.

1205
01:50:49,429 --> 01:50:50,847
Stupefy.

1206
01:51:06,988 --> 01:51:07,989
Levicorpus.

1207
01:51:14,537 --> 01:51:16,581
Petrificus Totalus.

1208
01:51:16,748 --> 01:51:18,541
Well done, Neville.

1209
01:51:27,008 --> 01:51:28,551
Stupefy.

1210
01:51:30,303 --> 01:51:31,554
- Stupefy.
- Stupefy.

1211
01:51:42,690 --> 01:51:44,567
Stupefy.

1212
01:51:52,117 --> 01:51:54,410
Reducto.

1213
01:52:10,426 --> 01:52:12,554
Get back to the door.

1214
01:52:47,839 --> 01:52:52,343
Department of Mysteries.
They got that bit right, didn't they?

1215
01:52:57,557 --> 01:52:59,476
The voices.

1216
01:53:00,018 --> 01:53:02,061
Can you tell what they're saying?

1217
01:53:03,730 --> 01:53:05,857
There aren't any voices, Harry.

1218
01:53:06,649 --> 01:53:08,401
Let's get out of here.

1219
01:53:08,568 --> 01:53:10,153
I hear them too.

1220
01:53:13,281 --> 01:53:15,909
Harry, it's just an empty archway.

1221
01:53:18,661 --> 01:53:20,079
Please, Harry.

1222
01:53:20,830 --> 01:53:22,707
Get behind me.

1223
01:54:09,254 --> 01:54:11,965
Did you actually believe...

1224
01:54:12,132 --> 01:54:16,719
...or were you truly naive enough
to think...

1225
01:54:17,345 --> 01:54:22,475
...that children stood a chance
against us?

1226
01:54:25,979 --> 01:54:29,732
I'll make this simple for you, Potter.

1227
01:54:33,403 --> 01:54:36,739
Give me the prophecy now...

1228
01:54:36,906 --> 01:54:40,910
...or watch your friends die.

1229
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:55,258
Don't give it to him, Harry.

1230
01:55:21,535 --> 01:55:24,288
Get away from my godson.

1231
01:55:54,401 --> 01:55:56,946
Now, listen to me.
Take the others and get out of here.

1232
01:55:57,321 --> 01:55:59,156
What? No, I'm staying with you.

1233
01:55:59,323 --> 01:56:02,159
You've done beautifully.

1234
01:56:02,827 --> 01:56:04,453
Now, let me take it from here.

1235
01:56:04,620 --> 01:56:05,621
Black.

1236
01:56:32,815 --> 01:56:34,150
Expelliarmus!

1237
01:56:34,316 --> 01:56:35,651
Nice one, James.

1238
01:56:42,867 --> 01:56:44,368
Avada Kedavra.

1239
01:57:04,555 --> 01:57:06,849
No. No.

1240
01:57:30,915 --> 01:57:33,459
I killed Sirius Black.

1241
01:57:34,460 --> 01:57:36,420
- You coming to get me?
- Crucio.

1242
01:57:48,766 --> 01:57:51,936
You've got to mean it, Harry.

1243
01:57:52,103 --> 01:57:55,856
She killed him. She deserves it.

1244
01:57:59,693 --> 01:58:02,905
You know the spell, Harry.

1245
01:58:14,458 --> 01:58:16,085
Do it.

1246
01:58:23,759 --> 01:58:26,720
So weak.

1247
01:58:33,477 --> 01:58:36,689
It was foolish of you
to come here tonight, Tom.

1248
01:58:36,856 --> 01:58:38,607
The Aurors are on their way.

1249
01:58:38,774 --> 01:58:42,987
By which time I shall be gone,
and you...

1250
01:58:44,488 --> 01:58:46,615
...shall be dead.

1251
02:01:00,917 --> 02:01:02,794
You've lost, old man.

1252
02:01:22,939 --> 02:01:23,940
Harry.

1253
02:01:28,111 --> 02:01:29,613
So weak.

1254
02:01:30,113 --> 02:01:32,324
So vulnerable.

1255
02:01:36,620 --> 02:01:37,621
Look at me.

1256
02:01:40,165 --> 02:01:44,419
Harry, it isn't how you are alike.

1257
02:01:44,586 --> 02:01:47,047
It's how you are not.

1258
02:01:52,010 --> 02:01:53,512
Harry?

1259
02:02:25,919 --> 02:02:27,379
You're the weak one...

1260
02:02:28,004 --> 02:02:32,134
...and you'll never know
love or friendship.

1261
02:02:35,554 --> 02:02:38,432
And I feel sorry for you.

1262
02:03:01,496 --> 02:03:04,958
You're a fool, Harry Potter.

1263
02:03:05,917 --> 02:03:11,047
And you will lose everything.

1264
02:03:25,979 --> 02:03:27,647
He's back.

1265
02:04:35,382 --> 02:04:37,050
I know how you feel, Harry.

1266
02:04:37,217 --> 02:04:38,844
No, you don't.

1267
02:04:44,474 --> 02:04:45,851
It's my fault.

1268
02:04:46,017 --> 02:04:49,312
No, the fault is mine.

1269
02:04:50,313 --> 02:04:52,065
I knew it was only a matter of time...

1270
02:04:52,232 --> 02:04:55,318
...before Voldemort made the connection
between you.

1271
02:04:56,111 --> 02:05:00,365
I thought by distancing myself from you,
as I have done all year...

1272
02:05:00,532 --> 02:05:05,745
...he'd be less tempted, and therefore
you might be more protected.

1273
02:05:08,582 --> 02:05:11,918
The prophecy said:

1274
02:05:12,544 --> 02:05:16,465
"Neither one can live
while the other one survives."

1275
02:05:17,841 --> 02:05:23,890
It means one of us is gonna
have to kill the other, in the end.

1276
02:05:25,892 --> 02:05:27,477
Yes.

1277
02:05:27,935 --> 02:05:29,520
Why didn't you tell me?

1278
02:05:29,687 --> 02:05:33,274
For the same reason
you tried to save Sirius.

1279
02:05:33,441 --> 02:05:35,902
The same reason your friends saved you.

1280
02:05:36,736 --> 02:05:40,239
After all these years,
after all you've suffered...

1281
02:05:40,406 --> 02:05:43,326
...I didn't want to cause you
any more pain.

1282
02:05:44,786 --> 02:05:46,913
I cared too much about you.

1283
02:06:11,771 --> 02:06:14,065
How come you're not at the feast?

1284
02:06:14,273 --> 02:06:18,820
Lost all my possessions. Apparently
people have been hiding them.

1285
02:06:18,986 --> 02:06:19,987
That's awful.

1286
02:06:20,196 --> 02:06:22,073
Oh, it's all good fun.

1287
02:06:22,240 --> 02:06:25,660
But as it's the last night,
I really do need them back.

1288
02:06:25,868 --> 02:06:28,246
Do you want any help finding them?

1289
02:06:31,124 --> 02:06:34,335
I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry.

1290
02:06:41,384 --> 02:06:43,469
Are you sure you don't want
any help looking?

1291
02:06:43,636 --> 02:06:45,304
That's all right.

1292
02:06:45,471 --> 02:06:47,598
Anyway, my mum always said...

1293
02:06:47,807 --> 02:06:51,644
...the things we lose have a way
of coming back to us in the end.

1294
02:06:54,897 --> 02:06:58,151
If not always in the way we expect.

1295
02:06:59,652 --> 02:07:02,363
Think I'll just go have some pudding.

1296
02:07:38,024 --> 02:07:40,943
I've been thinking about something
Dumbledore said to me.

1297
02:07:41,110 --> 02:07:42,820
What's that?

1298
02:07:43,404 --> 02:07:46,199
That even though
we've got a fight ahead of us...

1299
02:07:46,365 --> 02:07:49,452
...we've got one thing
that Voldemort doesn't have.

1300
02:07:49,619 --> 02:07:51,120
Yeah?

1301
02:07:53,039 --> 02:07:55,333
Something worth fighting for.
