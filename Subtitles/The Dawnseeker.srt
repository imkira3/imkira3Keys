Subtitles by explosiveskull

3
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:34,082
Our sun is dying.

4
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:39,625
And Union Corp controls all
of the remaining safe zones.

5
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,707
The last safe haven from
our dying star's wrath.

Those who are strong
enough to fight

7
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:53,038

00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,665
in unknown galactic
solar systems

in search of stardust.

Citizen, you are in possession
of government property.

14
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Stay, do not resist,
do not resist,

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,998
or I will use lethal force.

You are in possession of Code
two eight ba dess eight nine.

00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:28,250
Union City, now accepting
armed, unallied humans.

26
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:33,830
Proper build for a new tomorrow.

27
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:36,625
A better today, a
brighter future.

28
00:02:38,165 --> 00:02:40,290
It all starts with Union.

29
00:03:00,582 --> 00:03:04,288
In this city, come join a
thousand lucky soldiers who are

30
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:06,000
fighting for our future.

31
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,790
Help get started.

32
00:03:57,415 --> 00:03:59,455
You look scared.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
sweetheart.

34
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,291
Huh?

35
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:30,913
Union Corp
invites you on a journey

36
00:06:30,915 --> 00:06:33,413
unlike anything in the universe.

37
00:06:33,415 --> 00:06:36,288
All non-accepted will
have a chance to enlist.

38
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:38,288
The world needs you.

39
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,913
Help join the fight
to save our world.

40
00:06:40,915 --> 00:06:42,582
awaits you.

41
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,414
Dawnseeker.

42
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:14,539
It's one of the meanest,
nastiest sumbitches

43
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,583
we ever laid eyes on.

44
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:20,790
Now Omnia Prime is home
to many, many surprises.

45
00:10:25,457 --> 00:10:28,664
Most of which are
designed to do one thing,

46
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:30,041
and one thing very, very well,

47
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:34,833
and that's kill humans.

48
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:41,164
Or anything that doesn't
eat, breathe, or even shit

49
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,458
the way they are used to.

50
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,789
Now am I making
myself crystal clear

51
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,375
as to what we are up against?

52
00:10:55,832 --> 00:10:59,125
Good, now the Dawnseeker
has one objective.

53
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,875
One objective only.

54
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,664
That is to find, extract
the precious asset

55
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,541
known as stardust,

56
00:11:09,582 --> 00:11:11,289
which is the only thing that's
keeping that piece of shit

57
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,830
floating rock we call
Earth from reverting back

58
00:11:13,832 --> 00:11:15,040
to the dark ages.

59
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,455
So I'm not gonna have to
tell you how important it is

60
00:11:20,457 --> 00:11:23,914
that we locate the Stardust
and hightail our candy asses

61
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,500
back to base straight
to Nemean, understood?

62
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:35,457
Now as long as we have
this, we have him.

63
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,832
You rise at oh five hundred.

64
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:47,916
Get some rest, boys.

65
00:12:48,457 --> 00:12:49,664
It has like five
eyes or some shit.

66
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:51,123
What do you think, Evo?

67
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:51,957
Yeah.

68
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,875
Miles to go.

69
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,248
I'm gonna get you.

70
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,498
Yeah, you know he gets it.

71
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,375
The hierarchy.

72
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,915
It's best you don't forget that.

73
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,291
'Cause if you do?

74
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,916
Ooh, remember this face.

75
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,914
That's enough.

76
00:13:25,916 --> 00:13:27,330
Excuse me?

77
00:13:27,332 --> 00:13:29,125
That's enough, Otto.

78
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:37,915
I'll be seeing you
around.

79
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:14,623
Attention,
the reactor sector

80
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,164
is being isolated.

81
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:20,080
Repeat, the reactor
sector is being isolated.

82
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,664
Attention, the reactor
sector is being isolated.

83
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:09,375
Repeat, the reactor
sector is being isolated.

84
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:04,415
I can't do this, Father.

85
00:17:06,415 --> 00:17:10,124
Fenix, you're more
important than you know.

86
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:14,413
Look at your target and focus.

87
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:17,081
You really think
I can do this?

88
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:21,374
Fenix, one day you will be
called upon to change the world,

89
00:17:22,874 --> 00:17:27,333
and everything I have built
for mankind will belong to you.

90
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:12,038
How many with you?

91
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,873
Just me.

92
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,288
Darby...

93
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,332
Darby didn't make it.

94
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,956
Shit!

95
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,373
Where are the others?

96
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,623
What happened to our ship?

97
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:22,750
The others?

98
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,998
I've been pinned down
here for over a week.

99
00:20:37,125 --> 00:20:39,500
Rendezvous at
these coordinates.

100
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,913
Who are you?

101
00:22:39,915 --> 00:22:41,373
Name's York.

102
00:22:41,375 --> 00:22:42,873
York?

103
00:22:42,875 --> 00:22:45,456
Third battalion,
ninth level infantry.

104
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:48,541
My planet has been mining
here in peace for generations.

105
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,456
I don't follow.

106
00:22:51,458 --> 00:22:53,873
You are from Planet
Beta Four, right?

107
00:22:53,875 --> 00:22:55,623
Beta Four?

108
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,123
You mean Earth.

109
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,706
No, Planet Beta Four.

110
00:22:59,708 --> 00:23:02,498
I wouldn't know what you call
your planet, now would I?

111
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:05,581
Tell me who sent you!

112
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,375
Who sent me?

113
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,456
What did they tell you?

114
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:14,748
That you were on
some great mission?

115
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,875
Some save the
world kind of shit?

116
00:23:18,165 --> 00:23:20,163
Nemean has been
stripping the resources

117
00:23:20,165 --> 00:23:22,623
from this planet for decades.

118
00:23:22,625 --> 00:23:24,413
It's time he learned to share.

119
00:23:24,415 --> 00:23:25,831
What are you talking about?

120
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:31,583
We need him!

121
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,873
We need him!

122
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,706
Give me something!

123
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,750
If we are to make it to
the rendezvous, we need him.

124
00:23:41,958 --> 00:23:44,498
He's been trying to
kill me for over a week

125
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,123
and all you have is we need him.

126
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:51,500
What she's saying is, if
I'd have wanted you dead,

127
00:23:53,083 --> 00:23:54,125
you already would be.

128
00:24:02,208 --> 00:24:04,288
You have a rescue party.

129
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,332
I ain't gon' be here.

130
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,875
The fuck are
you talking about?

131
00:24:11,165 --> 00:24:13,290
We were never meant
to leave this place.

132
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,790
I'm impressed.

133
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,375
Stiffen up and let's play?

134
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:24,916
Yours cowboy.

135
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:37,125
Show you guys something.

136
00:24:55,583 --> 00:24:57,623
Happened when your vessel
broke through the sky.

137
00:24:57,625 --> 00:24:59,288
What happened to him?

138
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,790
I was hoping
you could tell me.

139
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,123
How the fuck would we know?

140
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,123
He was wearing
this fancy wristband,

141
00:25:06,125 --> 00:25:07,540
figured it meant something.

142
00:25:14,415 --> 00:25:15,250
Galen?

143
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:17,541
Not far from your crash site.

144
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,956
See, I figured his mono-pod
must've malfunctioned

145
00:25:21,958 --> 00:25:23,000
in the crash.

146
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:26,291
No, pods couldn't
have caused this.

147
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:30,750
This was done to him.

148
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:37,875
How can you be so sure.

149
00:25:39,415 --> 00:25:42,625
Because, it is a perfect kill.

150
00:25:44,915 --> 00:25:47,415
Whoever did this wanted
us to find him this way.

151
00:25:50,333 --> 00:25:51,625
You get all that
from a dead body?

152
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:56,581
No, and the fact that his
wristband is still intact,

153
00:25:56,583 --> 00:25:58,541
they were clearly
only after one thing.

154
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:00,666
Which is what?

155
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:03,750
Recognition.

156
00:26:10,915 --> 00:26:12,540
It says I am here.

157
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:22,873
What about the mission.

158
00:26:22,875 --> 00:26:24,913
Hey, how will we get paid?

159
00:26:24,915 --> 00:26:28,163
A man is dead, our entire
purpose here is at stake,

160
00:26:28,165 --> 00:26:30,082
and you're worried
about your credits?

161
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,707
Hey, he's dead, ain't he.

162
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:42,956
It's more credits for me.

163
00:26:42,958 --> 00:26:44,708
And York, York.

164
00:26:45,915 --> 00:26:47,663
Say, tell me, they got credits

165
00:26:47,665 --> 00:26:49,665
on whatever the fuck
planet you're from?

166
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:51,831
Huh?

167
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:53,288
Why don't you and I go
get the stardust ship

168
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,790
and double the price?

169
00:26:55,665 --> 00:26:56,665
Make that money.

170
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,498
Huh?

171
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,875
You hear me, are you deaf?

172
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,831
I heard you?

173
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:06,081
Then what's the problem.

174
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:06,916
Let's get paid.

175
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,707
There's only one problem.

176
00:27:10,915 --> 00:27:13,413
With your skills and
mine, we can make it

177
00:27:13,415 --> 00:27:14,832
all the way to the solar
fields, you know that.

178
00:27:15,875 --> 00:27:17,663
Come on.

179
00:27:17,665 --> 00:27:20,248
It's not what I found at
the crash that concerns me.

180
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:21,500
It's what I didn't find.

181
00:27:23,583 --> 00:27:25,708
The Dawnseeker.

182
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:29,038
Dead!

183
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,165
How can you be sure?

184
00:27:31,415 --> 00:27:34,206
Because no one
could've survived that.

185
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:35,623
Nothing!

186
00:27:35,625 --> 00:27:37,581
Whatever's shielding
us from what lies

187
00:27:37,583 --> 00:27:40,956
beneath the safe area,
it's the solar fields.

188
00:27:40,958 --> 00:27:42,000
What are those?

189
00:27:42,958 --> 00:27:45,913
Designed, created,
whatever they are,

190
00:27:45,915 --> 00:27:47,790
they protect us from
what's out there.

191
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:51,663
Is that why they
built a city here?

192
00:27:51,665 --> 00:27:53,750
Different regimes
like to converge, trade.

193
00:27:57,415 --> 00:27:58,707
And what of your regime?

194
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,790
Who do you fight for?

195
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,915
I guess we're
about to find out.

196
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:35,163
Jax, you're giving
away our position.

197
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:36,582
To who, Evo?

198
00:28:38,665 --> 00:28:41,707
Face it, Jax,
we're on our own.

199
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:47,956
Did you hear that?

200
00:28:47,958 --> 00:28:49,083
Yeah.

201
00:28:55,583 --> 00:28:57,166
Did you hear that?

202
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:01,041
Don't move!

203
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,125
It's us!

204
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,208
How many with you?

205
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,081
Anyone?

206
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:11,916
Just us, why?

207
00:29:14,375 --> 00:29:16,375
Did you see anyone, anything?

208
00:29:20,415 --> 00:29:21,290
It's not possible.

209
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,333
Jax.

210
00:29:24,375 --> 00:29:25,208
Just us.

211
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,041
Jax!

212
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:40,163
You ain't sending
us your location.

213
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:41,000
But why?

214
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,915
Evo, Evo, Evo!

215
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,498
Hope that's looking
for something bigger.

216
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,333
Shit!

217
00:30:40,165 --> 00:30:41,000
Grenade!

218
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,040
Evo!

219
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,831
Evo!

220
00:31:36,833 --> 00:31:37,788
Evo!

221
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,625
Evo!

222
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:52,206
What did this?

223
00:31:52,208 --> 00:31:54,581
Nothing I wanna
meet anytime soon.

224
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:56,250
We need to get to the Space Ark.

225
00:32:00,165 --> 00:32:01,706
That's a lot of credits.

226
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:03,913
The Space Ark doesn't sound
like it equals credits

227
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:06,040
in my account, so I say
fuck it and fuck you.

228
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:08,582
Let's go get some stardust.

229
00:32:13,458 --> 00:32:14,788
He has a transponder.

230
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:16,665
Without it, no one's
calling a ride home.

231
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,415
Hey, where you going?

232
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,500
I said where are you going?

233
00:32:28,708 --> 00:32:30,333
Whoever took Evo
laid a trap for us.

234
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,498
You aren't even
gonna look for him?

235
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,998
Why?

236
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,750
I can't grant him
passage to the afterlife.

237
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,625
She's a princess.

238
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,165
You're wasting your time.

239
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,540
Yeah, I know who you are.

240
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,375
Nemean Chord's very own.

241
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,375
What?

242
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,748
You think we wouldn't
recognize the boss's daughter?

243
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,498
Tell me, since we're
all so expendable,

244
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,663
how long before you
leave us all behind, huh?

245
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,706
You wanna find your
boyfriend, go find him yourself.

246
00:33:13,708 --> 00:33:15,413
Otherwise, go to hell.

247
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:16,250
You go first.

248
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:22,623
Now here's what's gonna happen.

249
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,081
We're gonna search
that trail over there.

250
00:33:25,083 --> 00:33:26,625
We're gonna get
that transponder.

251
00:33:27,833 --> 00:33:29,206
And then we're gonna
go find some stardust

252
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,458
because I didn't travel
50 years for nothing.

253
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:37,665
You, go grab the
stardust container.

254
00:33:48,665 --> 00:33:50,250
After you, princess.

255
00:34:34,166 --> 00:34:38,039
Stay back!

256
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:38,874
Evo!

257
00:34:39,958 --> 00:34:41,374
Where is your transponder?

258
00:35:08,375 --> 00:35:09,208
Stay back!

259
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:15,250
Help me.

260
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,206
One of your faction members?

261
00:35:53,208 --> 00:35:55,206
No, I've never seen
energy like that.

262
00:35:55,208 --> 00:35:57,206
Felt like it was
toying with us.

263
00:35:57,208 --> 00:36:00,456
Thought you said this planet was
void of intelligent life forms?

264
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:01,458
Void?

265
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:04,208
What did they tell you this
place was back on Beta Four.

266
00:36:05,375 --> 00:36:07,331
Best to mine
stardust, nothing more.

267
00:36:07,333 --> 00:36:08,375
Mine?

268
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,206
Stardust can only be
found in one place

269
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:14,458
and one place only, and that's
where your dawnseeker breed.

270
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:18,123
See they're born in tubes.

271
00:36:18,125 --> 00:36:19,998
They harvest the energy
from the stardust

272
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,208
to hatch their larva.

273
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:24,456
If they're as powerful
as I've read about,

274
00:36:24,458 --> 00:36:26,456
we got much larger problems.

275
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:27,291
Hey!

276
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:32,416
Look what I found.

277
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:40,666
We have to figure out
what we're up against.

278
00:36:41,708 --> 00:36:43,123
You said twos.

279
00:36:43,125 --> 00:36:44,166
Pairs.

280
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:47,000
Manipulating matter,
cloaking, energy,

281
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:50,250
basically the ultimate
goddamn killing machine.

282
00:36:52,416 --> 00:36:53,458
Helmet was a dampener.

283
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,373
What are you thinking?

284
00:36:57,375 --> 00:37:00,416
That it may still be figuring
out what it's capable of.

285
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:04,331
And that's why it
didn't try to kill us?

286
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:05,375
Nah.

287
00:37:06,916 --> 00:37:08,583
It's why it didn't
try to kill her.

288
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:15,416
Where's the other one?

289
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,208
Jax?

290
00:37:24,416 --> 00:37:25,956
Jax?

291
00:37:25,958 --> 00:37:26,791
Jax!

292
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,083
Jax?

293
00:37:42,541 --> 00:37:43,375
Jax!

294
00:37:57,041 --> 00:37:58,333
Where'd she go?

295
00:39:33,666 --> 00:39:36,916
Oh, I got you.

296
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:40,583
Get off me!

297
00:40:42,208 --> 00:40:43,291
No need to thank me.

298
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,583
And who the hell are you?

299
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,581
Do you have a ship?

300
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,541
What?

301
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:55,708
A ship?

302
00:40:58,916 --> 00:40:59,831
Ugh.

303
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,083
Why'd you stop me?

304
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:03,750
I almost had it?

305
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:06,623
Going after a
dawnseeker is suicide.

306
00:41:06,625 --> 00:41:08,081
Not this one.

307
00:41:08,083 --> 00:41:09,706
It hasn't fully developed yet.

308
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:11,206
How would you know?

309
00:41:11,208 --> 00:41:13,039
Because we brought
it from Earth.

310
00:41:13,041 --> 00:41:13,875
Earth?

311
00:41:16,166 --> 00:41:17,664
Terminus hasn't
destroyed it yet?

312
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,206
Terminus ended centuries ago.

313
00:41:19,208 --> 00:41:20,708
How long have you been here?

314
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:28,583
Okay, I say we follow it
through the north quadrant,

315
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,664
wait for it to get thirsty,

316
00:41:30,666 --> 00:41:32,000
and then we'll find a way to.

317
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,416
Jax!

318
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:45,458
Jax!

319
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:54,875
She was just here!

320
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,416
Lieutenant Thane
of the Black Suns.

321
00:43:18,666 --> 00:43:21,416
Fenix, from Beta Four.

322
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,750
We're searching
for a fugitive,

323
00:43:25,833 --> 00:43:27,875
highly skilled and dangerous.

324
00:43:30,791 --> 00:43:32,208
Can't say it rings any bells.

325
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,083
What are you other men?

326
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:42,125
We're just out on a
stroll, taking in the sights.

327
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:48,208
And you?

328
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,375
I'm, uh, I'm their guide.

329
00:43:55,708 --> 00:43:56,750
Hey!

330
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:59,831
We haven't seen her.

331
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,041
I will have answers.

332
00:44:02,541 --> 00:44:04,750
No honest mercenary'd be
caught dead in these parts.

333
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:07,875
Unless you're trying
to hide something

334
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:11,291
or looking for something
that needs to be hidden.

335
00:44:13,958 --> 00:44:15,748
Arrest them!

336
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,414
Stripping and mining
this planet's resources

337
00:44:18,416 --> 00:44:19,791
is against galactic law!

338
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:34,414
Call in the coordinates.

339
00:44:34,416 --> 00:44:36,333
Get a transport out
here immediately.

340
00:44:45,458 --> 00:44:47,831
You are making a big mistake.

341
00:44:47,833 --> 00:44:49,206
Dawnseeker has
breached your wall.

342
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,289
He has adapted to
the magnetic pulse.

343
00:44:51,291 --> 00:44:52,998
We had similar gear in our tech.

344
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,623
The only thing that
breached our walls

345
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,914
is staring right back at me,

346
00:44:56,916 --> 00:45:00,206
and if you don't stop flapping
them two things on your face,

347
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:01,541
I'm not gonna be so nice.

348
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:05,331
Good!

349
00:45:05,333 --> 00:45:06,833
I wouldn't have done that.

350
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,123
I want a pawn to rook
formation from corner to corner.

351
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,873
Nothing moves out here
without me knowing about it.

352
00:45:17,875 --> 00:45:19,331
Is that clear?

353
00:45:19,333 --> 00:45:20,873
Sir, yes sir!

354
00:45:20,875 --> 00:45:22,166
Sir, yes sir!

355
00:45:29,708 --> 00:45:32,458
Defensive positions.
To the right!

356
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,208
Cut us loose!

357
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:42,166
Cut us loose!

358
00:46:04,333 --> 00:46:05,916
Defensive positions!

359
00:46:07,041 --> 00:46:08,581
To the right!

360
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:10,456
I said cut us loose!

361
00:46:54,208 --> 00:46:56,000
Watch out!

362
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:39,041
Go!

363
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:40,875
Fall back!

364
00:48:42,166 --> 00:48:43,000
Fall back!

365
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,166
E.M.P.!

366
00:49:09,458 --> 00:49:11,664
Oh, that seemed...

367
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,873
different.

368
00:49:12,875 --> 00:49:15,623
That's because it was.

369
00:49:15,625 --> 00:49:17,456
It learned fast.

370
00:49:17,458 --> 00:49:21,083
No, this one was more
skilled, more adept.

371
00:49:22,291 --> 00:49:24,914
So got another one
of those on Beta Four?

372
00:49:27,541 --> 00:49:29,039
I think we may have
found his counterpart.

373
00:49:29,041 --> 00:49:30,331
What?

374
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:31,248
You shitting me?

375
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:32,208
There's another one out there?

376
00:49:33,166 --> 00:49:34,166
God!

377
00:49:39,208 --> 00:49:40,791
It's pinned us in.

378
00:49:42,708 --> 00:49:44,750
Because it didn't
try to harm any of us?

379
00:49:54,583 --> 00:49:57,875
Pulse wave knocked
out the solar fields.

380
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,791
What's that mean?

381
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:06,123
Whatever was on the
other side of the Space Ark

382
00:50:06,125 --> 00:50:08,833
just got an open invitation.

383
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:12,456
We need to get to the
other side of the Ark.

384
00:50:12,458 --> 00:50:13,958
The other side.

385
00:50:16,291 --> 00:50:18,041
We need to set up a perimeter.

386
00:50:22,083 --> 00:50:23,373
We need to cross over.

387
00:50:23,375 --> 00:50:24,789
I thought you
said it wasn't safe

388
00:50:24,791 --> 00:50:26,539
on the other side of the Ark.

389
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:29,248
That's before it was
less safe on this side.

390
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:33,164
If I've learned nothing,
I've learned nothing's safe

391
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:36,000
when the solar fields are down.

392
00:50:38,833 --> 00:50:39,791
Let's get the pikes.

393
00:50:45,666 --> 00:50:49,708
The way I see it is, Otto
is looking out for himself.

394
00:50:53,375 --> 00:50:56,331
And Thane only cares
about his men, so,

395
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:59,791
so it's just you and
me, what do you say?

396
00:51:01,333 --> 00:51:02,791
Let's just try and make
it through the night.

397
00:52:22,250 --> 00:52:24,125
You know, I had a family once.

398
00:52:28,625 --> 00:52:29,458
Daughter.

399
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,208
You remind me of her.

400
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:47,791
Smart.

401
00:52:49,458 --> 00:52:50,291
Stubborn.

402
00:52:55,250 --> 00:52:56,458
Till we were low on credits.

403
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:05,333
I did something I...

404
00:53:07,166 --> 00:53:10,166
Promised my wife
I'd never do again.

405
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:27,208
There's a few truths
in this world.

406
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:34,791
And never change, no matter
how much you want to.

407
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:40,583
You can never trust
anyone but yourself.

408
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,541
You just gotta ask
yourself one question.

409
00:53:56,250 --> 00:53:58,458
What do you think
they'll do to us by dawn?

410
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:13,956
Know if my men are
compromised in any way,

411
00:54:13,958 --> 00:54:15,958
I will kill you myself.

412
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:20,708
I caught this one
tampering with the pikes.

413
00:54:26,375 --> 00:54:30,250
Zan Desai, last
of the eternals.

414
00:54:31,541 --> 00:54:33,833
We've searched the galaxy
far and wide for you.

415
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:35,875
The stories are true.

416
00:54:52,708 --> 00:54:55,539
I made my name taming dogs!

417
00:54:55,541 --> 00:54:58,041
You're wanted for the
destruction of planet Demo,

418
00:54:59,291 --> 00:55:00,706
the killing of the
alpha group known

419
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:04,914
as the eternal Beta Four,
and numerous other charges

420
00:55:04,916 --> 00:55:08,041
of treason and evasion.

421
00:55:12,875 --> 00:55:14,500
Why'd you tamper with the pikes?

422
00:55:17,166 --> 00:55:18,333
How did you escape?

423
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,456
I didn't mess with the pike.

424
00:55:21,458 --> 00:55:22,541
I activated it.

425
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,623
You can't run
from the Black Suns.

426
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:29,125
We always get our mark.

427
00:55:31,166 --> 00:55:32,333
I wasn't running.

428
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:35,333
They have what I need.

429
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:52,875
Thane, I think
we have movement.

430
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:24,500
Check it out, now!

431
00:56:35,958 --> 00:56:37,041
Is it back?

432
00:57:11,708 --> 00:57:13,123
Move in!

433
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,458
Go, go!

434
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:11,166
Sucker punching piece of shit!

435
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,625
Like I said, let's get to
the other side of the Ark.

436
00:58:17,583 --> 00:58:18,625
Hey.

437
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:24,414
Why you always getting
your ass kicked?

438
00:58:24,416 --> 00:58:25,666
You're such a bad ass.

439
00:58:27,666 --> 00:58:28,914
Seriously, everybody
that meets you wants

440
00:58:28,916 --> 00:58:31,539
to beat the shit out of you.

441
00:58:31,541 --> 00:58:32,375
Let's go!

442
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:01,373
In order for us to
cross over, we need to know

443
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:03,789
what frequency the
Ark is vibrating at.

444
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:05,541
Frequency, what's that matter?

445
00:59:06,833 --> 00:59:09,248
Well, we're operating
at a different frequency,

446
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,208
it could trigger our
matter as hostile.

447
00:59:12,375 --> 00:59:14,916
Turn the would be
portal into a microwave.

448
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,623
Precisely.

449
00:59:17,625 --> 00:59:20,164
And I believe there
are other mercenaries

450
00:59:20,166 --> 00:59:21,625
trapped just on the other side.

451
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:24,414
You think they
left their ship.

452
00:59:24,416 --> 00:59:25,791
That's the idea.

453
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,414
But what about
the Earth's sun?

454
00:59:31,416 --> 00:59:32,250
Stardust?

455
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:38,250
Do they know?

456
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:41,873
Know that you're a criminal,

457
00:59:41,875 --> 00:59:44,081
a treacherous
backstabbing snake?

458
00:59:44,083 --> 00:59:45,750
I think that was
made clear, yeah.

459
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:47,956
Funny how
people never seem

460
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,500
to ask the right questions.

461
00:59:50,791 --> 00:59:53,583
I suggested gagging you
but decided against it.

462
00:59:56,708 --> 00:59:58,333
How's Father doing nowadays?

463
01:00:04,166 --> 01:00:06,706
Father couldn't care less
about saving the planet

464
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,833
and even less if you were alive.

465
01:00:10,458 --> 01:00:13,039
So you had to come
see for yourself.

466
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,583
You're welcome.

467
01:00:16,125 --> 01:00:18,081
Some rescue.

468
01:00:18,083 --> 01:00:20,914
Don't look like
you needed rescuing.

469
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:23,708
Do they know you sabotaged
the ship to crash land here?

470
01:00:25,625 --> 01:00:26,831
No more than they know
what you're truly doing

471
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:28,083
on this side of the Ark.

472
01:00:29,666 --> 01:00:32,125
How long are you going to
keep up this little charade?

473
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,498
As long as it takes.

474
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,914
I have no intentions
of saving Beta Four.

475
01:00:38,916 --> 01:00:41,081
Although I wish
your planet well,

476
01:00:41,083 --> 01:00:44,039
my job is to keep you
at bay while my employer

477
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:46,498
obtains the stardust
for his self.

478
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,333
Hold me at bay?

479
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:50,666
You son of a bitch!

480
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:52,833
You could've fucking killed me!

481
01:00:54,291 --> 01:00:56,623
York's a galactic legend.

482
01:00:56,625 --> 01:00:59,791
Singlehandedly took down the
prison, ice prison in Pompeii.

483
01:01:01,166 --> 01:01:02,958
That's not a man
who's easily bested.

484
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,541
Now tell me, what of
this other dawnseeker.

485
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:21,248
It isn't a weapon.

486
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:24,664
It's a living species,
and from what I gather,

487
01:01:24,666 --> 01:01:25,750
not from this planet.

488
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:27,500
What do you mean?

489
01:01:29,166 --> 01:01:32,375
This Space Ark is a ripple
in time caught between realms.

490
01:01:34,041 --> 01:01:36,539
On their planet, the
dawnseeker's no different

491
01:01:36,541 --> 01:01:37,375
from you and I.

492
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,833
A species with
multiple layers.

493
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,081
That's why I'm on this side.

494
01:01:46,083 --> 01:01:48,581
In order to save Earth,
you must save the sun

495
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:50,373
on the other side of the Ark.

496
01:01:50,375 --> 01:01:52,708
The Earth will exist in a
different ideal of time.

497
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:57,289
So you're gonna keep those
things as trophies or what?

498
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:59,581
Each member of the Black
Suns is born and bred

499
01:01:59,583 --> 01:02:00,458
on the battlefield.

500
01:02:01,791 --> 01:02:05,625
Where I come from, war
has no peace after it.

501
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:20,416
Go.

502
01:02:24,041 --> 01:02:24,875
Go!

503
01:02:25,666 --> 01:02:26,500
Now!

504
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:29,666
The Space Ark's right ahead.

505
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:53,083
I knew you would be here.

506
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:10,916
York?

507
01:03:11,791 --> 01:03:12,998
Are you alright?

508
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:14,000
We need a plan.

509
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,081
What are you talking about?

510
01:03:17,083 --> 01:03:17,998
The Space Ark's right up there?

511
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,831
Yeah, but there's one problem.

512
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:21,000
See, I have my transponder.

513
01:03:22,291 --> 01:03:27,291
Fenix has Evo's, and I'm
fairly certain, yeah,

514
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:29,875
there's no doubt,
you've got one.

515
01:03:31,208 --> 01:03:33,623
And I don't have to tell you
that without a transponder

516
01:03:33,625 --> 01:03:35,373
you can't cross over
the magnetic field

517
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:36,208
to the Space Ark.

518
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,000
So...

519
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:52,081
Hey no, what are you doing?

520
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:02,583
The way I see it,
someone's gotta be bait.

521
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:05,123
If you destroy
the transponders,

522
01:04:05,125 --> 01:04:06,500
none of us can cross
through the Ark.

523
01:04:08,125 --> 01:04:09,708
You think I
wanna survive this?

524
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,123
No.

525
01:04:12,125 --> 01:04:14,916
See, I know why the
dawnseeker won't harm you.

526
01:04:16,875 --> 01:04:18,083
'Cause you set it free!

527
01:04:22,583 --> 01:04:25,208
Why don't you be a
doll and hand it over.

528
01:04:35,041 --> 01:04:36,039
What are you doing?

529
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:37,664
No!

530
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:45,791
Stop!

531
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:49,916
You're next, sweetheart.

532
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:51,833
Now you.

533
01:04:58,791 --> 01:04:59,708
I said you!

534
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:19,125
Go!

535
01:08:13,291 --> 01:08:14,331
We have to hurry up
and get the stardust

536
01:08:14,333 --> 01:08:17,246
before sun burns up
while we're not there.

537
01:08:17,248 --> 01:08:19,371
The order predicted
that the space time ratio

538
01:08:19,373 --> 01:08:22,414
between what's left of
Earth and the dying sun

539
01:08:22,416 --> 01:08:24,666
shouldn't be a
concern until 2240.

540
01:08:27,582 --> 01:08:29,414
Exactly.

541
01:08:29,416 --> 01:08:31,371
What year is it?

542
01:08:31,373 --> 01:08:33,039
It's July 2245.

543
01:08:33,041 --> 01:08:35,121
We have a very short
window to find the stardust

544
01:08:35,123 --> 01:08:36,621
and deliver it before we
have to seal ourselves

545
01:08:36,623 --> 01:08:38,791
into hibernation pods
again for the winter.

546
01:09:07,457 --> 01:09:08,290
Look.

547
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:11,123
What's that?

548
01:09:12,248 --> 01:09:13,455
Is that?

549
01:09:13,457 --> 01:09:14,290
The Ark?

550
01:09:26,666 --> 01:09:29,166
This used to be
a portal to the other side?

551
01:09:30,748 --> 01:09:33,166
Transfusion fiber.

552
01:09:36,041 --> 01:09:38,705
This isn't just a gateway.

553
01:09:38,707 --> 01:09:40,623
This is a time machine.

554
01:10:03,750 --> 01:10:04,582
Careful.

555
01:10:07,082 --> 01:10:08,705
Dawnseeker!

556
01:10:23,582 --> 01:10:24,415
Hey!

557
01:10:50,041 --> 01:10:51,330
We have to cross
through the Ark!

558
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,373
Go!

559
01:10:52,375 --> 01:10:53,332
The Ark may close!

560
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,833
You need to get the stardust!

561
01:15:45,916 --> 01:15:47,750
The ship.

562
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,207
Fenix!

563
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:46,748
We need power to
the main console.

564
01:17:06,375 --> 01:17:07,291
Stardust.

565
01:17:08,582 --> 01:17:10,873
I've never seen
this type before.

566
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:13,375
It's pure,
not from this planet.

567
01:17:14,791 --> 01:17:16,000
How do you know that?

568
01:17:18,457 --> 01:17:19,665
'Cause I brought it.

569
01:17:25,791 --> 01:17:27,291
We need to get off this ship

570
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:31,666
and fly it directly
into the sun.

571
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:39,875
Last chance?

572
