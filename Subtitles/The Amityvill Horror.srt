<i>Catch them. </i>

3
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,295
<i>Kill them. </i>

4
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,034
What's wrong, Ronnie?

5
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:01,974
I love you, Jodie.

6
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:20,826
<i>Suffolk County police. 
May I help you?</i>

7
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,524
<i>Everybody's dead. </i>

8
00:03:22,902 --> 00:03:24,665
<i>What do you mean,
"everybody's dead"?</i>

9
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,905
<i>A guy come running
into the bar and says... </i>

10
00:03:27,073 --> 00:03:29,439
<i>... his mother and father are shot. </i>

11
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,338
I've been to a lot of crime scenes,
never seen one like this.

12
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:35,003
<i>Six members of the family
were found last night... </i>

13
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,214
...in bed, shot...

14
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,178
...and killed.

15
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:44,950
<i>Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,
his wife and four of their children. </i>

16
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,751
<i>The sole survivor of the family... </i>

17
00:03:46,926 --> 00:03:49,190
<i>... 23-year-old
Ronald "Butch" Defeo Jr... </i>

18
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:51,262
<i>... is said to have discovered
the bodies. </i>

19
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,422
<i>The police state
that for his own safety... </i>

20
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,761
<i>... they're holding him
in protective custody. </i>

21
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:58,699
<i>Five of the victims were found
shot facedown on their beds. </i>

22
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,034
The sixth was found in a closet.

23
00:04:02,942 --> 00:04:05,410
No one seemed to stir in their sleep.
It's strange.

24
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:09,446
<i>Suffolk County police have charged
23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr. </i>

25
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,607
<i>The accused told police
he heard voices... </i>

26
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:15,083
<i>... coming from within the house,
telling him to murder his family. </i>

27
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:31,860
Oh, God!

28
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,896
Damn it.

29
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:45,150
Hi, Michael.

30
00:04:45,485 --> 00:04:47,146
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?

31
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,311
George, what are you doing
to my mom?

32
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,715
Nothing.

33
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:53,654
- Yet.
- You perv.

34
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,728
Come on up here, little man.

35
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,872
You can make it.

36
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,540
Oh, you're getting heavy.

37
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:19,045
Did you meet my dad?

38
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,981
No...

39
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:23,654
...never had the pleasure, pal.

40
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,819
Do I have to call you "Dad" now?

41
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:29,321
- Guess what.
- What?

42
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,392
- You can call me whatever you want.
- Anything?

43
00:05:32,565 --> 00:05:34,556
- Yep.
- Cool.

44
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,634
- Anything.
- Cool.

45
00:05:36,803 --> 00:05:38,430
Yeah.

46
00:05:39,038 --> 00:05:40,903
- Stinky.
- Sure.

47
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,632
- Poopy-head.
- Yeah.

48
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:44,640
Crap-monkey-fart.

49
00:05:44,811 --> 00:05:48,110
Okay, we gotta draw the line
somewhere, pal, that does it.

50
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,484
All right.

51
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:04,722
- This sucks.
- You're not kidding.

52
00:06:04,897 --> 00:06:06,364
Billy.

53
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,768
Look, maybe we'll grab you
something on the way to school.

54
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:12,905
- What do you say, huh?
- I'm not hungry. I can walk to school.

55
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,632
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.

56
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:18,369
I'll drop you a couple blocks away.
Nobody'd see.

57
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,512
- Mom, I'm 12 years old.
- Before you plan...

58
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,513
...your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at school.

59
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,617
We got a big day.

60
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,778
Why? Where are you guys going?

61
00:06:30,523 --> 00:06:33,219
- Mom, can you help me?
- Oh, Michael.

62
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,324
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.

63
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,195
Not according to this.

64
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:45,963
- Well, then it's gotta be true.
- Think positive, babe.

65
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,597
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.

66
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:53,775
Look, when the business
is going good...

67
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:55,174
...we're gonna...
- There.

68
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,576
- What?
- That's it.

69
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,444
- Look.
- Honey.

70
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,415
Baby, look, 412 Ocean Avenue.

71
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:08,760
- It's beautiful.
- What?

72
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,245
Look at how friendly they are here,
honey.

73
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,938
They get like that when they think
they'll make a sale.

74
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:34,280
Let's just play it cool, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.

75
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:36,545
Or not.

76
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:46,088
- Hi there.
- I'm Katherine Lutz.

77
00:07:46,265 --> 00:07:48,426
Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?

78
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:51,069
- George.
- This is an amazing house.

79
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:55,264
You are going to love it.
Just follow me in here.

80
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,700
Careful on the steps there.

81
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,722
Holy shit.

82
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,157
Excuse me.

83
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,700
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

84
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,904
This... This is a mistake.

85
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,370
How's that?

86
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,702
No, I mean your ad in the paper.

87
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,502
This is...

88
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,840
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...

89
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,415
...and I know what a place
like this should cost.

90
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,881
And, you know, if this is...

91
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:43,681
Well, if this is true, then this is a...
The deal of a lifetime.

92
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,217
And what is wrong with that?

93
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,890
- Come on.
- I love it.

94
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,965
- There's a vibrant history here.
- Vibrant history, George.

95
00:08:57,136 --> 00:09:00,867
In fact, the house was built
in 1692, at least the basement.

96
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:03,875
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.

97
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,534
It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials
in Long Island.

98
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:08,077
Wow, that's impressive.

99
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,375
This room would be perfect
for children, if you have any.

100
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:15,612
And the view's...
Well, have a look for yourselves.

101
00:09:18,357 --> 00:09:19,984
There's a boathouse.

102
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:22,127
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?

103
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:25,321
Actually, George has a speedboat.

104
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,334
This place sounds
like it's made for you.

105
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:42,705
And this is your basement.

106
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,045
As you can see,
it's very spacious.

107
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:48,846
It can be a game room,
a playroom.

108
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,852
Well, let's... Let's have a look.

109
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:59,688
I'll just wait up here.

110
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,534
Yep, looks like a basement.

111
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,731
So, what do you guys think?

112
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:14,209
- I think you look foxy in that skirt.
- Will you stop it? Come on.

113
00:10:25,891 --> 00:10:28,018
Yes, yes, okay?

114
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:31,353
It's a value. It's a value
for people with money.

115
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,624
Okay, look, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.

116
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,461
We deserve this, George.

117
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,729
You deserve this.

118
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,600
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so little.

119
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,436
- Kathy...
- Maybe today is the day it all pays off.

120
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:47,337
- We'll make sacrifices.
- Huge sacrifices.

121
00:10:47,513 --> 00:10:50,505
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...

122
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:52,947
...this is the life we want.

123
00:11:08,534 --> 00:11:10,695
- We're happy?
- Yes, we're happy.

124
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,395
She's happy. I'm broke.

125
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,874
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

126
00:11:17,076 --> 00:11:21,308
So look, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?

127
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,746
There's always a catch.

128
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:30,679
There was a tragedy, a crime...

129
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,586
...a murder.
- I'm sorry, what?

130
00:11:33,826 --> 00:11:35,691
In the house?

131
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,996
Several people, a family.

132
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,633
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whole town.

133
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,498
It is a distant memory now.

134
00:11:46,272 --> 00:11:48,502
And the house is fine.

135
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:50,198
Really.

136
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:53,037
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?

137
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,407
Well, houses don't kill people.

138
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,912
People kill people.

139
00:11:59,185 --> 00:12:02,211
Just... Excuse us.

140
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,121
Do you think we can make it work?

141
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,361
You know what?

142
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:16,962
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.

143
00:12:17,136 --> 00:12:19,297
- Really?
- I'll work out of the basement...

144
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:21,269
...and you can, well...

145
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,141
...sell one of the kids.
- Hey.

146
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:26,334
A little one.

147
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:43,124
We're rich! We're rich!

148
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:46,393
We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.

149
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:50,401
Wait.

150
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,973
- You say your prayers?
- Yep, said them twice.

151
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:37,979
- What did you pray for?
- Lf I tell you, it won't come true.

152
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:40,814
Why don't you tell him the truth.

153
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:43,477
- What?
- Praying doesn't do any good.

154
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,322
William.

155
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:49,051
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept alive.

156
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,165
Don't say that.

157
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,662
Sometimes things happen in life
that can't be explained, Billy.

158
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,371
Billy, look at me.

159
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:12,716
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?

160
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:17,016
You're not being disloyal
to Dad by liking George.

161
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:21,018
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...

162
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,425
...and maybe one day
something more.

163
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,055
Nobody will ever
replace your dad, honey.

164
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,196
For you too?

165
00:14:31,971 --> 00:14:33,632
For me too.

166
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,817
How's Billy?

167
00:14:51,323 --> 00:14:52,984
He'll be fine.

168
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:56,553
- First call.
- First call.

169
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:02,790
<i>- Lutz residence, how may I help you?
- Can I talk to my daughter, please?</i>

170
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:07,300
Yeah, sure, she's...
She's right here. Okay.

171
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:10,234
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriously.

172
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,343
It's embarrassing now.

173
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:14,641
<i>Hello?</i>

174
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,542
<i>- Hey, Ma.
- Hi. </i>

175
00:15:18,817 --> 00:15:21,047
No, we're all moved in.

176
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:25,316
- Yeah, Ma.
- Are you cold?

177
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,390
No, Ma.

178
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,126
Yeah.

179
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:39,415
- What is it, baby?
- Nothing.

180
00:17:41,126 --> 00:17:44,152
- Are you okay, baby?
- No.

181
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,664
I don't feel well.

182
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,149
- Give me a kiss.
- I can do it, I can do it.

183
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:05,840
No, you can't.

184
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,148
Come here, come here.

185
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:13,890
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.

186
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:24,559
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

187
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,272
- Chelsea?
- Hey, Mommy.

188
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,706
Hi, hon. Who are you talking to?

189
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:36,439
- The girl who lives in my closet.
- Oh, yeah?

190
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,913
- And what's her name?
- Jodie.

191
00:18:39,918 --> 00:18:43,445
You know there are plenty of other
little girls to play with in town too?

192
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,852
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.

193
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,255
Is that Jodie?

194
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,424
No, that's someone else.

195
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,093
Who?

196
00:18:59,271 --> 00:19:02,001
I'm not supposed to say who.

197
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,367
She says it's an A-hole.

198
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,036
You are not allowed
to say that word.

199
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:31,429
George, George.

200
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,634
- Look what I found.
- What is that? Where'd you find that?

201
00:19:34,806 --> 00:19:36,034
Harry and I found it.

202
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,307
- Where?
- In the basement.

203
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,436
Not the basement.

204
00:19:41,613 --> 00:19:43,672
My office.

205
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:47,885
You listen to me.
You don't go down there.

206
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:50,246
Understand?

207
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,626
Guys, would you help me
with the groceries?

208
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,934
Go on, go help your mom.

209
00:20:09,975 --> 00:20:11,772
I'm sorry.

210
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,970
Go on.

211
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,420
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

212
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,196
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.

213
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,596
Billy will love that.

214
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,760
How about we call her
the young-adult-sitter?

215
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,704
Where's Chelsea?

216
00:20:45,777 --> 00:20:47,369
Where's Chelsea?

217
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:58,786
Chelsea?

218
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,659
Chelsea?

219
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,900
Chelsea!

220
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:17,640
Chelsea.

221
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:19,299
Hey, give me your hand.

222
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,839
Give me your hand, sweetie.

223
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,414
- Chelsea, go to George.
- Come on. Hey, give me your hand.

224
00:21:30,155 --> 00:21:32,885
What were you thinking?
You could have fallen in the water.

225
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,958
Jodie wanted to see the boat.

226
00:21:38,096 --> 00:21:40,189
Somebody should have been
watching you.

227
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:43,190
Billy, get up.

228
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,320
Billy, I gotta go pee.

229
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,403
Chelsea.

230
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,778
Goddamn it, Harry.

231
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,720
Seriously. You trying to kill me?

232
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,614
Come on, get away from there.

233
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,622
Hey, that's enough.

234
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,755
Hey!

235
00:27:20,438 --> 00:27:22,872
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?

236
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:27,007
It's the only place
that's warm in this damn house.

237
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,306
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.

238
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,648
What is that?

239
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,490
You tell me.

240
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:44,928
- Why don't you come back to bed.
- No, I can't sleep.

241
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,757
I'm sorry, baby.

242
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,728
Don't...

243
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,630
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your kids, okay?

244
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:54,363
- What?
- That goddamn dog woke me up.

245
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,737
Billy's dog.

246
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:01,144
Found him in the boathouse.

247
00:28:02,447 --> 00:28:04,938
- But you locked it.
- Yeah.

248
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:07,676
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.

249
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:18,087
You ready to talk
about those keys?

250
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,460
There's not a lot in this world can't
be solved with an apology, Billy.

251
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:24,033
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do...

252
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,499
...George.

253
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,874
Get to work, buddy.

254
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,044
"Get to work, buddy. "

255
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,544
"Katch 'em... "

256
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,386
George?

257
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,756
George?

258
00:29:22,393 --> 00:29:24,486
George, you down there?

259
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:27,965
George?

260
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:31,730
What?

261
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,393
What's the matter?

262
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,839
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?

263
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,579
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.

264
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:17,276
You look hideous.

265
00:30:17,448 --> 00:30:20,042
You're rather repulsive yourself,
Mr. Lutz.

266
00:30:20,218 --> 00:30:22,709
- Where's the babysitter?
- Babysitter?

267
00:30:22,887 --> 00:30:24,684
Told you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.

268
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:26,983
- I'm old enough.
- Baby, I know you can...

269
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,094
I'm not letting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't let her. I won't.

270
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,697
- She's not coming in.
- Billy, listen to me.

271
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:37,028
- I won't leave you alone.
- I can't believe you hired a babysitter.

272
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:38,794
- I told you I was old enough.
- Hi.

273
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,666
- I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
- Great.

274
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,207
Can I take your coat?

275
00:30:44,475 --> 00:30:46,067
Okay.

276
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,775
Hi.

277
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:52,911
I'm Billy.

278
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:05,155
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?

279
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:07,387
Would you like me
to show you around?

280
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:08,862
No, it's okay.

281
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,695
I know it already.
I used to sit for the Defeos.

282
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,840
Kind of freaky being back here.

283
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,868
I'm Billy.

284
00:31:20,078 --> 00:31:22,012
Yeah, I got you the first time.

285
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,941
Have a good night, Billy.

286
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:35,082
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?

287
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,922
Yeah. Definitely.

288
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:40,030
You feeling all right?

289
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,923
You know what?

290
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,931
I feel better.

291
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:47,371
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.

292
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,301
Come on, drink up.

293
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,408
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?

294
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,807
That's the appeal of marriage, hon.

295
00:31:54,979 --> 00:31:56,776
Hopefully, I won't have to.

296
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,985
Be right out.

297
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,296
Hungry?

298
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:21,430
Kid, you read my mind.

299
00:32:21,973 --> 00:32:23,235
The kids, they're...

300
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,569
They're going through
a tough time.

301
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,109
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.

302
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,304
Yeah, well, we all are.

303
00:32:32,183 --> 00:32:34,117
Do you feel different?

304
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,248
What do you mean?

305
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,186
About us.

306
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,726
About me.

307
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:48,626
Yeah.

308
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,028
Yeah, I do.

309
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:56,133
I feel like for the first time in my life,
I'm sure about something.

310
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,839
And that's you.

311
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,806
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life making you happy.

312
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,416
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.

313
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,687
Some people say his tongue is fake.

314
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,559
I think it's all him.

315
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,504
Got this at a pinball arcade.

316
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:31,398
Cool.

317
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:35,809
So do you French?

318
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,939
Do I what?

319
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,676
Kissing, tongues.

320
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,281
No.

321
00:33:45,556 --> 00:33:48,116
Did your family know the Defeos?

322
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,692
- The who?
- The family that lived here before you.

323
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,826
No, we just moved here.

324
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,398
Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?

325
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:01,802
No.

326
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,668
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

327
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,869
Your parents are gonna be pissed.

328
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,343
It's okay.

329
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:19,253
Stop. That's not how you play.

330
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,884
- I can't hear you.
- Stop it. Let me try.

331
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:27,092
You're killing him.

332
00:34:28,966 --> 00:34:31,958
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that lived here.

333
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:35,739
People in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.

334
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:40,207
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.

335
00:34:40,378 --> 00:34:41,743
So he kills it.

336
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,609
A few days later, he thinks his family
is a bunch of demons.

337
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,642
So you know what he did?

338
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,283
Wasted them.

339
00:34:51,556 --> 00:34:53,285
How did he do it?

340
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:56,559
Do what?

341
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,287
You are way too young to hear this.

342
00:34:59,464 --> 00:35:01,557
So cover your ears.

343
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,459
And don't listen.

344
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,397
A rifle.

345
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,971
He went room to room,
splattering their heads as they slept.

346
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,341
He killed his brothers
in this very room.

347
00:35:17,882 --> 00:35:19,679
Right here.

348
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,710
In these beds.

349
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:33,192
It's kind of gross
you guys still sleep in here.

350
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:38,601
Actually, it's fucking sick.

351
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:41,468
Yeah.

352
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:43,668
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.

353
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:47,876
I suck at babysitting.

354
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,519
This was the little brat's room.

355
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,989
Jodie's.

356
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,357
You know, they found her in there.

357
00:36:04,128 --> 00:36:06,688
- Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
- Yeah?

358
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,229
Well, Jodie's...
What's the word? Dead.

359
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:12,359
Is not.

360
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,232
That little shit got me fired.

361
00:36:18,142 --> 00:36:19,871
Dare you to go in there.

362
00:36:21,812 --> 00:36:23,837
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?

363
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:27,517
Okay.

364
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,181
Okay.

365
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:34,686
You're going to make her mad.

366
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,564
Come on, guys.

367
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,230
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.

368
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:50,840
Billy, Michael.

369
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:55,273
It's not opening. I can't open it.

370
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,380
- Unlock the fucking door.
- There's no lock.

371
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,277
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.

372
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,441
Billy, Michael.

373
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:04,611
Let me out. Let me out of here.

374
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:06,951
Let me out of here!

375
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,093
What's going on?

376
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,827
Let me out.

377
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,692
Hi, Lisa.

378
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:22,098
Look what Ronnie did.

379
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:43,287
Let me out!

380
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,962
Let me out of here!

381
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,465
Let me out!

382
00:37:48,633 --> 00:37:51,067
Help me. Let me out!

383
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,303
I saw Jodie.

384
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:04,778
I saw Jodie.

385
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,473
Who's Jodie?

386
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:08,776
The little girl.

387
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:12,149
She's dead.

388
00:38:12,323 --> 00:38:14,655
She's supposed to be dead.

389
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:23,890
- It's one thing to pull a prank.
- We didn't pull a prank.

390
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,536
- It's another one to hurt someone.
- It was this house.

391
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,399
Shut up!

392
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,366
- George.
- I got this under control.

393
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,340
You don't have you under control.

394
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,212
What you guys did was wrong.

395
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:41,942
Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...

396
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:44,053
...whatever you're saying
doesn't work.

397
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:48,148
From now on, I'm doing the
disciplining around here, end of story.

398
00:38:48,526 --> 00:38:50,619
This house is bad, Mommy.

399
00:38:51,228 --> 00:38:52,718
Michael, honey.

400
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,832
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad people.

401
00:38:58,536 --> 00:39:01,630
Why didn't you tell us
about the people who died here?

402
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:07,074
- Where did you hear that?
- The babysitter told me...

403
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,543
...that two little boys died
in our room.

404
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,312
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.

405
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:22,185
Get to bed. We'll deal with this
in the morning.

406
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,590
No, I'm not sleeping in that room.
It's gross.

407
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:27,128
- Me neither.
- Wipe that stupid look off your face...

408
00:39:27,298 --> 00:39:28,788
...and go to bed.

409
00:39:31,936 --> 00:39:33,528
Run.

410
00:39:56,193 --> 00:39:58,388
Why all the yelling, Mommy?

411
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:03,360
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.

412
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:09,036
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.

413
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,073
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.

414
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,642
So Jodie hurt her.

415
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,573
- Jodie.
- It's okay, Mommy.

416
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,449
Jodie won't hurt you.

417
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:21,749
She thinks you're a good mommy.

418
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,954
But the man who lives here...

419
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:30,654
...she says he's bad.

420
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,359
She wants him to go away.

421
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:38,157
He makes her do bad things.

422
00:40:45,209 --> 00:40:46,574
Move it...

423
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:48,644
...from there to there.

424
00:40:48,813 --> 00:40:50,144
Go.

425
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,652
And, Billy, don't come in
until you're finished.

426
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:38,885
What?

427
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:42,797
Is this discipline or torture?

428
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:45,128
Thought it was meat loaf.

429
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:55,172
When the body suffers,
the spirit flowers.

430
00:41:55,446 --> 00:41:57,573
It's what my dad taught me.

431
00:41:57,748 --> 00:42:01,115
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?

432
00:42:11,595 --> 00:42:15,053
Billy, why is George such a jerk?

433
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:19,032
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.

434
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,495
And a weirdo.

435
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:24,538
And a doofus and a dipstick.

436
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:26,869
<i>Catch them. </i>

437
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,035
<i>Kill them. </i>

438
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:34,107
<i>Catch them. </i>

439
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,617
<i>Kill them. </i>

440
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:46,622
<i>Catch them. Kill them. </i>

441
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,333
<i>Catch them. </i>

442
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,401
<i>Kill them. </i>

443
00:43:09,486 --> 00:43:11,477
Kill them.

444
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:29,958
- No! No!
- Look at me.

445
00:44:30,134 --> 00:44:32,432
- No!
- What's the matter?

446
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,096
- God!
- It's me.

447
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,399
- It's me.
- God!

448
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:44,077
Baby, it's all right.

449
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,288
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?

450
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:55,652
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...

451
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,657
...some serious thought.

452
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,589
Suffer from headaches, nausea?

453
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:07,601
Actually, I feel great now.

454
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,333
Weird as that may sound.

455
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,207
Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.

456
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,005
No sign of any bruising at all.

457
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:21,740
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.

458
00:45:22,786 --> 00:45:25,983
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.

459
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:29,182
- Do I look nuts to you?
- I'm not trying to offend you here.

460
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:31,793
I'm just trying to help you
figure out the problem.

461
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:41,934
I feel like it's my fault, George.

462
00:45:42,106 --> 00:45:44,199
- Kath.
- I was the one who wanted this place.

463
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,740
- I put too much pressure on you.
- This is the life...

464
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,434
...that I want too, okay?

465
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:53,273
We got the old American dream here.

466
00:45:53,517 --> 00:45:55,576
Okay? There's no way in hell...

467
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,687
...that I'm letting that get away now.

468
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,820
I love you, George.

469
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,826
Billy, can I get my teddy?

470
00:46:12,002 --> 00:46:13,970
She's real hungry.

471
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:17,164
Okay, go. And hurry up.

472
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:20,105
Mom finds out I let you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.

473
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,266
Hi, Mommy.

474
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,734
Look at me, Mommy.

475
00:46:48,939 --> 00:46:50,338
Hi, Mommy.

476
00:46:53,777 --> 00:46:55,768
Hi, Mommy.

477
00:46:56,713 --> 00:46:58,078
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

478
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:01,581
- Chelsea.
- Chelsea, don't move. Just sit down.

479
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,276
Chelsea.

480
00:47:11,395 --> 00:47:13,056
Chelsea.

481
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:17,924
Hold the ladder.

482
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,863
Honey, stay there.

483
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,871
Chelsea.

484
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,507
Chelsea.

485
00:47:29,646 --> 00:47:32,080
- Chelsea.
- Goddamn it, Chelsea.

486
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:35,412
Which way?
Which way did they go?

487
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,476
Going left.

488
00:47:47,497 --> 00:47:49,362
Chelsea.

489
00:48:08,285 --> 00:48:09,877
What are you doing up here?

490
00:48:12,856 --> 00:48:14,289
I have to go with Jodie, Mommy.

491
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:16,115
Baby...

492
00:48:16,293 --> 00:48:18,284
...you come to Mommy.

493
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:20,558
No!

494
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,227
George.

495
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,529
- Hang on.
- Hurry.

496
00:48:30,774 --> 00:48:32,469
George!

497
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,873
George, please, God, I'm slipping.

498
00:48:36,546 --> 00:48:38,036
George!

499
00:48:38,715 --> 00:48:40,683
George!

500
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:46,088
<i>Chelsea. </i>

501
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:48,521
What would you...?
Why would you do that?

502
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:50,785
Sorry. I'm sorry.

503
00:48:50,994 --> 00:48:52,586
You can't do that to Mommy.

504
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,130
- Jodie wanted to show me something.
- There is no Jodie, okay?

505
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,234
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't!

506
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,303
- You have to stop this!
- Jodie's real.

507
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,840
- Jodie's real. She's...
- She is not real!

508
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,977
Liar! Liar!

509
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,806
Liar!

510
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:13,807
I've seen her.

511
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:18,212
She was gonna show me Daddy.

512
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,856
I just wanted to see Daddy.

513
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:24,152
Jodie promised to take me to Daddy.

514
00:49:24,328 --> 00:49:26,819
She says I can stay here
so we can play together...

515
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,760
...forever and ever.

516
00:49:30,701 --> 00:49:32,760
Do you miss your daddy?

517
00:49:32,936 --> 00:49:34,426
Yes.

518
00:49:34,604 --> 00:49:37,903
- Do you miss your daddy a lot?
- Yes.

519
00:49:39,710 --> 00:49:41,974
I know you miss your daddy, baby.

520
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,009
But no one can see him because...

521
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:47,616
...he's in heaven.

522
00:49:48,952 --> 00:49:50,476
He's with the angels.

523
00:49:51,922 --> 00:49:54,288
He's with the angels.

524
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:00,657
I just got so scared.

525
00:50:11,274 --> 00:50:12,866
What's the matter with you people?

526
00:50:22,919 --> 00:50:24,853
Wacko family.

527
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,876
Father Callaway?

528
00:50:57,487 --> 00:50:59,045
Father.

529
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,686
Kathy Lutz.

530
00:51:01,858 --> 00:51:03,325
Hello.

531
00:51:03,927 --> 00:51:05,861
Do you have a moment?

532
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:13,536
It's my family.

533
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:16,336
We've changed. It's...

534
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,701
It's like we've grown apart.

535
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,801
I don't think I understand.

536
00:51:25,282 --> 00:51:28,615
There's something...

537
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:32,412
There's something evil in my house.

538
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:38,487
I know it sounds...

539
00:51:38,662 --> 00:51:40,926
...crazy, I know that.

540
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,328
I would think the same.

541
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:45,964
I just don't know where else to go.

542
00:51:52,709 --> 00:51:54,802
There was a family...

543
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:56,610
...lived here some time ago.

544
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,446
They had a similar problem.

545
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,084
The Defeos.

546
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,615
You knew them?

547
00:52:07,657 --> 00:52:09,420
I'm living in their house.

548
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:18,929
Now, hold it steady.

549
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:22,037
Because if you get shaky,
I get shaky.

550
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,741
Go!

551
00:52:37,120 --> 00:52:38,485
What, are you crying?

552
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:42,386
Why are you crying?
That wasn't so bad.

553
00:52:42,893 --> 00:52:44,827
Pick up another log.

554
00:52:45,195 --> 00:52:46,662
Hurry up, pick up another log.

555
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:48,457
Hurry up.

556
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:52,998
Put your hands up there.
Put your hands up there.

557
00:52:53,370 --> 00:52:54,632
No.

558
00:52:55,105 --> 00:52:56,732
Put...

559
00:52:57,707 --> 00:53:00,733
We're friends.
We're having fun, right?

560
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:02,378
Put your hands up there.

561
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:12,821
Go!

562
00:54:10,981 --> 00:54:13,211
Come here, little girl.

563
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,182
You're my favorite girl.

564
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:43,869
<i>Catch them. </i>

565
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,912
<i>Kill them. </i>

566
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:38,714
George.

567
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:44,686
I think there's something
seriously wrong here.

568
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:48,022
Something's not right.

569
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:51,297
What's not right?

570
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:56,532
We need to get out of here.

571
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,937
To just go. Just pack up and go.

572
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:03,505
No, no, no.

573
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,941
You know, you can't run away
from your problems, Kath.

574
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,612
Please, let's go, George.

575
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:14,356
- Somewhere. Anywhere.
- Did you hear that?

576
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:19,026
Do you hear that squeak?
I gotta fix that squeak.

577
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:23,230
Because, you know, these houses,
they're big...

578
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,833
Big projects. Kath, and you
can't just walk away from it.

579
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,242
How did you get so fucking stupid?

580
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,346
What?

581
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:46,411
Everything we have is in this house.
Everything.

582
00:58:46,589 --> 00:58:48,580
I'm not worried
about our goddamn money.

583
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,224
Oh, our money.

584
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,594
George, we're losing each other.

585
00:58:53,763 --> 00:58:55,697
Don't you see that?

586
00:58:56,466 --> 00:58:58,991
We stay here,
we'll have a house for the family...

587
00:58:59,168 --> 00:59:01,329
...only there won't be a family.

588
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:06,834
It's always so cold in here.

589
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,438
Would you let the stove alone
and pay attention to me?

590
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,377
I'm not going anywhere,
neither are you.

591
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,017
So shut up about that!

592
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:17,177
Just shut up!

593
00:59:17,587 --> 00:59:19,077
Goddamn it.

594
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:21,887
You're the one who wanted
this godforsaken house.

595
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:23,389
Well, now you got it.

596
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,289
Mom! Mom!

597
00:59:25,595 --> 00:59:27,688
Home sweet home.

598
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:32,962
What is it, sweetie?

599
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,400
We can't find Harry anywhere.
He's gone.

600
00:59:37,307 --> 00:59:39,298
I'll help you look in a sec, sweetie.

601
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:41,500
You seen Harry, George?

602
00:59:42,211 --> 00:59:44,202
No, I haven't, Billy.

603
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,911
Maybe he ran away.

604
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,552
Harry never runs away, George.

605
00:59:51,621 --> 00:59:53,714
What's the matter with you, William?

606
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:55,448
Get out of here now.

607
00:59:55,625 --> 00:59:59,721
- Now!
- Fine. Come on, Michael.

608
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:30,853
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

609
01:00:45,541 --> 01:00:47,270
- Hello?
- Is your mommy home?

610
01:00:47,443 --> 01:00:48,842
Hold on a second.

611
01:00:49,345 --> 01:00:51,438
Mommy, there's someone
at the door.

612
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:53,138
Who is it, honey?

613
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:56,181
Come in, Father.

614
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,858
This is gonna sound strange...

615
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:11,831
...but you know the doll with one eye
that your daughter is holding?

616
01:01:12,135 --> 01:01:15,298
Well, that belonged to the little girl
who lived here before you.

617
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,572
Yes, it was left here.

618
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:20,709
No, Mrs. Lutz, it was not left here.

619
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:25,971
Father, what exactly
are you trying to tell me?

620
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:29,744
I knew the Defeos very well.
I presided over their funeral.

621
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:32,878
Jodie Defeo was buried
with that doll.

622
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:44,761
Oh, heavenly Father.

623
01:01:46,502 --> 01:01:48,493
Almighty God...

624
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,376
...we ask you to bless...

625
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:59,607
...and sanctify this house.

626
01:02:01,684 --> 01:02:06,712
To bless all who live here...

627
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:12,092
...and to bring them the abundance
of all thy fruits.

628
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:08,311
<i>Get out. </i>

629
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,016
Father!

630
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,851
Father!

631
01:03:19,095 --> 01:03:20,585
Why are you leaving us?

632
01:03:21,264 --> 01:03:23,027
What's the matter?

633
01:03:28,938 --> 01:03:32,772
It's okay. I'm here.

634
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,390
<i>Catch them. </i>

635
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,091
<i>Kill them. </i>

636
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,275
Oh, goddamn it, Harry!

637
01:04:10,246 --> 01:04:11,838
<i>Catch them. </i>

638
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:15,510
<i>Kill them. </i>

639
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,437
<i>Catch them. </i>

640
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:47,874
<i>Kill them. </i>

641
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,811
<i>Catch them. </i>

642
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:27,580
<i>There was a crime. A murder. </i>

643
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,290
<i>You know, the town has moved on. </i>

644
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:34,361
<i>And it is a distant memory now,
and the house is fine. </i>

645
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,467
We don't open
for a few more minutes.

646
01:06:03,125 --> 01:06:05,320
"Voices told him to do it. "

647
01:06:09,332 --> 01:06:12,130
"He just moved into the basement. "

648
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:16,502
"Twenty-eights days later
he killed them all. "

649
01:06:30,052 --> 01:06:31,280
Oh, my God.

650
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:25,069
"Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham. "

651
01:07:35,918 --> 01:07:38,580
"He started a mission for Indians. "

652
01:08:25,201 --> 01:08:27,328
"He slaughtered them all. "

653
01:08:39,982 --> 01:08:43,418
"Over 20 bodies were found
in the lake. "

654
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:02,633
<i>Catch them. </i>

655
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:06,965
<i>Kill them. </i>

656
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,565
Father.

657
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:39,733
Why did you run away
from my house?

658
01:09:42,745 --> 01:09:44,736
Why did you abandon us?

659
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:48,646
Your house frightens me, Mrs. Lutz.

660
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:55,584
I just read about this man,
Ketcham...

661
01:09:56,158 --> 01:10:00,390
...who tortured Indians on my land.
On my basement.

662
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:08,297
I read about how he slit his throat...

663
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,030
...so that his presence
would live forever.

664
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:13,539
Do you believe this could be true?

665
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:17,175
Ronnie Defeo came to me
weeks before the murders...

666
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:22,374
...and he spoke about hearing voices
and seeing things in the house.

667
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,216
I didn't believe him until yesterday.

668
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:31,683
Mrs. Lutz, get you and your family
out of that house...

669
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:33,191
...right now.

670
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:47,837
<i>- Hello?
- George. </i>

671
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:50,308
<i>George, I've just been to see
Father Callaway. </i>

672
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:53,471
<i>Listen to me, you gotta get you
and the kids out of the house. </i>

673
01:10:54,617 --> 01:10:56,084
<i>George?</i>

674
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:58,943
<i>Are you there? George?</i>

675
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:16,937
Billy! Michael! Where's George?

676
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:19,233
He's in the boathouse.

677
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:40,156
George, we have
to get out of here now.

678
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,921
George!

679
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:23,671
Are you fucking crazy, George?

680
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:25,498
Have you lost your mind?

681
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,232
You tried to kill me.

682
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:35,314
- Chelsea!
- Mommy! Mommy!

683
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:36,849
I'm down here, Mommy!

684
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,747
Chelsea, honey,
what are you doing down here?

685
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:10,511
I think she misses her daddy.

686
01:13:13,822 --> 01:13:15,380
Don't you?

687
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,590
Give me back my daughter.

688
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:28,133
I wanna talk to you. Wait.
I wanna talk to you!

689
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,438
Kids, get down here, now!

690
01:13:31,607 --> 01:13:33,438
Kids, get down here!

691
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:35,975
- Billy, help me push this!
- Mom, where are you going?

692
01:13:39,481 --> 01:13:41,039
Billy!

693
01:13:42,284 --> 01:13:43,546
- Hurry. Go.
- Billy!

694
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:46,951
Mom, why are you wet?

695
01:13:48,290 --> 01:13:50,554
Mommy! Mommy!

696
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:54,491
Come on, Mom!

697
01:13:56,031 --> 01:13:57,362
Hurry.

698
01:13:58,100 --> 01:14:00,534
Billy, come on!

699
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:16,545
Run! Go, go, go!

700
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:20,981
You're stuck! You're stuck!

701
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:23,050
Stay here!

702
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:26,855
Great!

703
01:14:27,696 --> 01:14:31,496
Let go of my mom, you bastard!
Let go right now! Let go.

704
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,767
- What the hell is your problem?
- Let's go.

705
01:14:39,775 --> 01:14:41,538
These kids are out of control.

706
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:47,011
- Mom, it's stuck!
- It won't open!

707
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,149
Where's Chelsea? Chelsea!

708
01:15:04,666 --> 01:15:09,126
- Hurry, hurry, Billy. Hurry.
- Come on. Let's go. Be quiet, be quiet.

709
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:55,747
Billy!

710
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:43,794
I want you to hold on tight.

711
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,305
Jump, baby.

712
01:16:58,680 --> 01:17:00,011
- Come on, honey.
- Come on.

713
01:17:00,182 --> 01:17:01,809
- Come on, Michael.
- No, Mommy.

714
01:17:01,984 --> 01:17:03,975
- No.
- Hurry, baby.

715
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:07,353
Come on, Michael.
Come on, Michael.

716
01:17:08,557 --> 01:17:10,286
- Come on, hurry.
- Let's get out of here.

717
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,653
- Come here. Come here.
- No.

718
01:17:18,467 --> 01:17:20,799
You leave him alone.

719
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:26,532
<i>Kill them. </i>

720
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:29,138
Don't hurt him!

721
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,307
Back the fuck up!

722
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:16,656
<i>Kill them. </i>

723
01:18:24,633 --> 01:18:27,329
Hurry. Let's grab some rope.

724
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:31,171
<i>Kill them. </i>

725
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:52,692
Kathy, kill me!

726
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,420
You kill me, or I'll kill you!

727
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,961
Nobody's dying today.

728
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:22,755
Okay, let's get him in the boat.

729
01:19:46,915 --> 01:19:49,076
Why are we taking him?
Let's just leave him here.

730
01:19:49,251 --> 01:19:52,618
I can't explain it to you right now. We
have to get him away from the house.

731
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:53,574
Don't even look at it, Kathy.

732
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,305
Let's get out of here.

733
