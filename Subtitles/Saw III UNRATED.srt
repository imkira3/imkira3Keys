1
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:36,831
Game over.

2
00:00:36,935 --> 00:00:39,403
I'll fuckin' kill you!

3
00:00:39,504 --> 00:00:41,734
You fuckin' bitch!

4
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:44,241
You bitch!

5
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,069
I'll fuckin' kill you!

6
00:02:16,868 --> 00:02:18,995
Daniel!

7
00:05:15,213 --> 00:05:18,649
Secure the flank!
Left side clear?

8
00:05:18,749 --> 00:05:20,182
We're clear!

9
00:05:20,284 --> 00:05:22,718
Left side's clear.
Let's move!

10
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,267
Oh, my God.

11
00:05:39,804 --> 00:05:41,328
Someone call Kerry.

12
00:05:41,439 --> 00:05:45,239
The call came in at 11:45.
The woman heard an explosion.

13
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,674
The fire department was
the first on the scene.

14
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:47,869
Kerry.

15
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:50,209
- Is it him?
- Before you go in there--

16
00:05:50,314 --> 00:05:52,441
Eric. Is it him?

17
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,744
We don't know yet.

18
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,955
It's not Detective Matthews.

19
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:18,675
What happened?

20
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:22,177
The victim was held
in place by these chains.

21
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:04,712
Hello, Troy.

22
00:07:04,822 --> 00:07:07,347
I wanna play a game.

23
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,722
This game will take place
in a room not much bigger

24
00:07:09,827 --> 00:07:12,557
than the room you've
spent most of your life in.

25
00:07:12,663 --> 00:07:14,290
A prison cell.

26
00:07:14,398 --> 00:07:16,832
Despite all of the advantages
and privileges

27
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,561
that you were given at birth,

28
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:22,867
you have returned
to prison again and again.

29
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:26,273
More comfortable in chains
than you are in freedom.

30
00:07:26,377 --> 00:07:29,904
Tonight we will see how
far you are willing to go

31
00:07:30,014 --> 00:07:32,539
to break those chains
once and for all.

32
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,140
Live or die, Troy.

33
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,378
Make your choice.

34
00:07:55,373 --> 00:07:57,773
This was the bomb.

35
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:03,438
All he had to do was release himself
from each of the chains...

36
00:08:03,547 --> 00:08:07,506
walk out the door before it went off.

37
00:08:09,553 --> 00:08:11,180
All he had to do?

38
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,564
Oh, God.

39
00:09:33,704 --> 00:09:36,070
Fuck! Fuck!

40
00:09:53,324 --> 00:09:55,724
I really had this feeling
it was going to be him.

41
00:09:55,826 --> 00:10:01,230
Kerry, Eric is a missing persons case,
not a homicide case.

42
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,959
I've been having nightmares
where I see him.

43
00:10:11,842 --> 00:10:14,743
I'm never going to be able
to forgive myself for what happened.

44
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:17,245
Listen.
It's not your fault.

45
00:10:17,348 --> 00:10:18,645
It's always somebody's fault.

46
00:10:18,749 --> 00:10:20,216
That somebody isn't you.

47
00:10:20,317 --> 00:10:22,581
That someone is still out there.

48
00:10:22,686 --> 00:10:26,588
Put all your anger into finding them
and putting them away.

49
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,987
All right?

50
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:31,760
What I don't understand is

51
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:33,420
how the hell could Jigsaw
do all of this?

52
00:10:33,531 --> 00:10:36,159
He was damn near on his deathbed
the last time we saw him.

53
00:10:39,036 --> 00:10:40,298
I'm not so sure he did.

54
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:42,668
So far this doesn't follow
any of his patterns.

55
00:10:42,773 --> 00:10:44,104
Meaning?

56
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:46,870
Well... how'd you get in here?

57
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:49,241
- We cut the door down.
- Why?

58
00:10:49,346 --> 00:10:52,406
Because somebody heard
an explosion and called us.

59
00:10:52,516 --> 00:10:54,814
I mean, why did you
have to cut the door down?

60
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,648
It was welded shut.

61
00:10:56,754 --> 00:10:58,119
Bloody truck couldn't get in here.

62
00:10:58,222 --> 00:10:59,484
Exactly.

63
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,558
I don't follow.

64
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:04,025
If the aim of Jigsaw's game was
to get out before the bomb went off,

65
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:05,891
then why was the door
welded shut?

66
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,294
The guy couldn't get out if he wanted to.

67
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,596
You won't believe this.
We got the tape out clean.

68
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:07,151
Hello, Troy.
I wanna play a game.

69
00:12:09,426 --> 00:12:12,918
Live or die, Troy.
Make your choice.

70
00:14:12,082 --> 00:14:13,106
Hello, Kerry.

71
00:14:14,585 --> 00:14:16,075
I want to play a game.

72
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:20,452
Up until now you have spent
your life among the dead

73
00:14:20,557 --> 00:14:22,149
piecing together
their final moments.

74
00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:25,558
You are good at this because you,
like them,

75
00:14:25,662 --> 00:14:26,959
are also dead.

76
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:29,726
Dead on the inside.

77
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:33,997
You identify more
with a cold corpse

78
00:14:34,104 --> 00:14:36,004
than you do
with a living human.

79
00:14:36,106 --> 00:14:39,234
I believe you want
to join your true family,

80
00:14:39,343 --> 00:14:42,437
indeed, your only family,
in death.

81
00:14:43,881 --> 00:14:45,508
The device you are wearing

82
00:14:45,616 --> 00:14:48,210
is hooked into your ribcage.

83
00:14:48,318 --> 00:14:50,377
And by the time
this tape is finished,

84
00:14:50,487 --> 00:14:53,684
you will have one minute
to find a way out.

85
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:57,158
At the end of that minute,
you should know

86
00:14:57,261 --> 00:15:00,355
better than anyone
what happens then.

87
00:15:00,464 --> 00:15:03,558
There is a simple key
that will unlock the harness, Kerry.

88
00:15:03,667 --> 00:15:05,225
It is right in front of you.

89
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:09,101
All you have to do is
reach in and take it.

90
00:15:10,307 --> 00:15:11,797
But do it quickly.

91
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:16,937
The acid will dissolve the key
in a matter of seconds.

92
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:19,413
Make your choice.

93
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,536
You.

94
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:36,112
I gotta be at the hospital by 9.

95
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:41,223
It's Tuesday.
I thought you started at 11.

96
00:17:41,325 --> 00:17:45,159
Yeah, well, they change
things on me last minute.

97
00:17:45,262 --> 00:17:46,752
Well, you better head off, then.

98
00:17:54,504 --> 00:17:55,664
You're not gonna take a shower?

99
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,474
Nah. I'm just gonna take
a shower at the hospital.

100
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:06,311
Can we just...
talk for five minutes?

101
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:10,284
How about we just make eye contact
for five seconds?

102
00:18:10,387 --> 00:18:11,479
What's wrong?

103
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:16,753
Nothing.
Just... everything.

104
00:18:19,429 --> 00:18:20,987
Lynn.

105
00:18:21,098 --> 00:18:22,827
What is it you want from me, Chris?

106
00:18:24,801 --> 00:18:25,790
A divorce.

107
00:18:35,145 --> 00:18:36,134
MPA.

108
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:39,276
Car skidded into oncoming traffic.

109
00:18:40,851 --> 00:18:41,749
Pressure?

110
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,046
80 over, palp.
Pulse is thready.

111
00:18:43,153 --> 00:18:44,984
Ready? 1, 2, 3.

112
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:47,818
- Where's Lynn?
- Page Dr. Denlon.

113
00:18:47,924 --> 00:18:48,822
Set up an art-line.

114
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:49,892
Dr. Lynn Denlon,

115
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,324
please report
to trauma immediately.

116
00:18:51,862 --> 00:18:54,296
Dr. Lynn Denlon, please
report to trauma immediately.

117
00:18:56,199 --> 00:18:57,166
Lynn!

118
00:18:59,136 --> 00:19:00,933
Check this out.
Hermaphony.

119
00:19:01,038 --> 00:19:04,098
Pressure down to 70.
He's going into shock.

120
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,198
Get an OR ready.
We gotta crack his chest.

121
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,902
Do we get a bolus?
500 wide open?

122
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:08,978
No.

123
00:19:10,647 --> 00:19:12,239
What?

124
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,546
- No air entry on the right side.
- And?

125
00:19:17,654 --> 00:19:19,519
Let's get a chest tube in him.

126
00:19:19,623 --> 00:19:22,558
We gotta get him to OR now.

127
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,559
His stats are dropping.
He's gonna code.

128
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,097
I'm doin' it.

129
00:19:38,575 --> 00:19:40,133
I'm getting a rush of air.

130
00:19:40,243 --> 00:19:43,269
Stats are improving.
Pressure back to 80.

131
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,848
Pressure normal.

132
00:20:02,699 --> 00:20:04,530
If you got something on your mind,
go upstairs to psych.

133
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,261
Just don't bring it in here.

134
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:07,997
We don't have any seconds to spare, Lynn.

135
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,699
The woman standing in front of me
had to be dragged

136
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:13,640
from the locker room
to put a chest tube in a trauma patient?

137
00:20:13,744 --> 00:20:15,678
Lynn Denlon should have been
the first one there.

138
00:20:19,483 --> 00:20:20,450
Lynn.

139
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:22,452
Lynn!

140
00:20:56,486 --> 00:20:57,783
What the hell?

141
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,618
I'm locked in!

142
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:01,714
Is anybody there?

143
00:21:01,825 --> 00:21:03,053
Hello?

144
00:21:11,168 --> 00:21:12,795
Anybody here?

145
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:40,051
Help! Help me!

146
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:44,492
Help!

147
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,894
Who are you?
Who are you?

148
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:53,799
What is this?

149
00:22:56,106 --> 00:22:59,837
What are you doing?

150
00:23:04,648 --> 00:23:05,910
Are you gonna behave?

151
00:23:13,757 --> 00:23:15,122
Let's go.

152
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:19,855
What is this place?
What is this place?

153
00:23:28,972 --> 00:23:31,668
What is... this place?

154
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:41,410
Who are you?
Who are you?

155
00:23:46,389 --> 00:23:47,947
Hello, Dr. Denlon.

156
00:23:48,058 --> 00:23:52,791
You may not remember me,
but I most certainly remember you.

157
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:58,459
I was a guest at your hospital once.

158
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:02,638
Where am I?

159
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:07,809
Do you remember me?

160
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,617
I've seen you on television.

161
00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:22,891
Lawrence Gordon was your doctor.

162
00:24:22,993 --> 00:24:26,485
I was his patient,
and he was mine.

163
00:24:27,998 --> 00:24:29,761
As you can see from that report,

164
00:24:29,866 --> 00:24:31,731
my prognosis isn't good.

165
00:24:33,436 --> 00:24:35,495
Would you agree?

166
00:24:42,412 --> 00:24:44,812
There's no preventative treatment
for what you have.

167
00:24:44,914 --> 00:24:47,883
I remember you saying that
to me once before

168
00:24:47,984 --> 00:24:50,544
in almost the exact same tone.

169
00:24:50,654 --> 00:24:54,317
Leave it to a doctor to find such a cold,
clinical way

170
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:57,518
of saying I'm a dead man walking.

171
00:24:57,627 --> 00:25:00,289
Looking at me,
how long would you say I have left?

172
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:03,525
I'd have to examine you.

173
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:06,500
Even then,
a frontal lobe tumor is unpredictable.

174
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:10,004
The growth depends on the rate of mitosis
versus apoptosis--

175
00:25:10,106 --> 00:25:14,543
I'm sorry, but there's all this crude
medical equipment around me

176
00:25:14,644 --> 00:25:18,102
causing you to believe
that you're still inside a hospital.

177
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:19,511
No.

178
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,083
Then why are you speaking to me

179
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:24,244
in that graduate school
medical jargon?

180
00:25:26,823 --> 00:25:27,721
Look at me!

181
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:32,124
Now, you look at me.

182
00:25:32,228 --> 00:25:34,753
I asked you a simple question.

183
00:25:34,864 --> 00:25:36,593
Based on your experience,

184
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,227
how long do you think I have left?

185
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:42,463
It's not a simple answer.

186
00:25:42,572 --> 00:25:47,532
Based on your file,
I'd say... not long.

187
00:25:56,152 --> 00:25:58,347
Death is a surprise party.

188
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:04,189
Unless, of course,
you're already dead on the inside.

189
00:26:07,464 --> 00:26:08,954
Unless you're the type of person

190
00:26:09,065 --> 00:26:12,933
who swallows antidepressants
to hide the pain, huh?

191
00:26:13,036 --> 00:26:15,197
Turns their back on their husband.

192
00:26:15,305 --> 00:26:17,364
Neglects their child.

193
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:20,034
Who has every possible
advantage in life

194
00:26:20,143 --> 00:26:22,611
but chooses not to advance.

195
00:26:22,712 --> 00:26:24,612
What do you want from me?

196
00:26:26,182 --> 00:26:27,945
What do I want?

197
00:26:30,053 --> 00:26:31,452
I want to play a game.

198
00:26:34,924 --> 00:26:38,416
The rules of the game are simple.

199
00:26:38,528 --> 00:26:42,123
The consequences
for breaking them are great.

200
00:26:42,232 --> 00:26:43,199
Death.

201
00:26:45,802 --> 00:26:48,464
You're being tested.
Your will is being tested.

202
00:26:48,571 --> 00:26:50,505
Your will to keep someone alive.

203
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:51,767
Can you do that?

204
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:54,605
Can you follow the rules
and grant someone the gift of life?

205
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:57,646
What is this?
No! Get it--

206
00:26:57,747 --> 00:27:03,276
No! No! What is this!
What are you doing to me?

207
00:27:09,058 --> 00:27:13,119
The device that you're wearing
is linked to my heart rate monitor.

208
00:27:13,229 --> 00:27:18,030
The second that heart rate monitor flatlines
or you move out of range,

209
00:27:18,134 --> 00:27:21,001
an explosion will go off in that collar.

210
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:25,507
Your life and my life
will end simultaneously.

211
00:27:26,743 --> 00:27:28,802
Please.
Please don't do this to me.

212
00:27:28,912 --> 00:27:31,745
I have a family.
I have a family.

213
00:27:31,848 --> 00:27:34,214
Let me give you
the simple version.

214
00:27:35,752 --> 00:27:39,381
You will keep him alive,
whatever it takes.

215
00:27:39,489 --> 00:27:44,017
No excuses.
No equivocations.

216
00:27:44,127 --> 00:27:45,924
No crying.

217
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:48,759
What do you mean,
keep him alive?

218
00:27:51,601 --> 00:27:56,402
Out there, on those screens,
we have another test subject.

219
00:27:56,506 --> 00:27:58,565
A man.

220
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:04,507
He will face a series of tests.

221
00:28:04,614 --> 00:28:09,813
You have to keep John alive
until he makes it through.

222
00:28:10,854 --> 00:28:14,915
If he completes all of his tests
and John is still breathing,

223
00:28:15,024 --> 00:28:17,584
then I will remove your collar...

224
00:28:19,462 --> 00:28:21,123
and you're free to go.

225
00:28:22,398 --> 00:28:24,889
You're a vital piece
of my puzzle, Dr. Denlon.

226
00:28:25,001 --> 00:28:28,767
A critical part of what could be
my final test.

227
00:28:30,573 --> 00:28:34,373
Amanda,
it's time to start our game.

228
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:06,706
Help!

229
00:29:13,182 --> 00:29:14,149
Hello!

230
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,988
Is there anybody out there?

231
00:29:28,731 --> 00:29:30,995
Hello, Jeff.

232
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,727
Over the past few years,

233
00:29:32,835 --> 00:29:35,770
you have become a shell
of your former self...

234
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,069
consumed with hatred
and vengeance.

235
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:42,975
Vengeance against the drunk driver
who killed your only son.

236
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:48,415
Vengeance against the killer,
who to your surprise and dismay,

237
00:29:48,518 --> 00:29:52,716
was set free after a hasty trial.

238
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:57,122
Today, however,
it is you who will be put on trial.

239
00:29:57,226 --> 00:30:02,163
To escape from where you are,
you will have to face a series of tests.

240
00:30:02,265 --> 00:30:06,565
You will have to suffer
to move forward through each of them.

241
00:30:06,669 --> 00:30:10,935
But with each one,
you will also have a chance...

242
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,168
a chance to forgive.

243
00:30:14,277 --> 00:30:15,539
When you complete the tests,

244
00:30:15,645 --> 00:30:19,081
I promise you
you will finally come face to face

245
00:30:19,182 --> 00:30:22,083
with the man responsible
for the loss of your child.

246
00:30:22,185 --> 00:30:25,245
That will be your ultimate test.

247
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,915
Can you forgive him?

248
00:30:29,459 --> 00:30:30,551
You better hurry, though.

249
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:33,891
In two hours, the doors will lock,

250
00:30:33,997 --> 00:30:37,160
and this place
will become your tomb.

251
00:30:37,266 --> 00:30:40,793
This is what you've
been waiting for, Jeff.

252
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:42,495
Let the game begin.

253
00:30:42,605 --> 00:30:44,505
Help!

254
00:31:11,167 --> 00:31:13,727
You fucking killed my son.

255
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:16,566
Don't you fuckin' beg.

256
00:31:16,672 --> 00:31:20,802
Do you know who I am?

257
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:24,906
I'll fuckin' teach you,
you motherfucker.

258
00:31:34,457 --> 00:31:36,584
This is what you fuckin' deserve.

259
00:31:57,647 --> 00:31:59,171
Where is it?

260
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:00,909
What?

261
00:32:02,985 --> 00:32:04,179
Where is it?

262
00:32:11,694 --> 00:32:13,093
How many times?

263
00:32:14,597 --> 00:32:16,326
How many times
do I have to tell you

264
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:17,865
before you get it in your head?

265
00:32:17,967 --> 00:32:20,765
I just wanted
to sleep with something.

266
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:22,770
No. No. You just-- nothin'.

267
00:32:22,872 --> 00:32:27,832
You don't... touch things in Dylan's room.

268
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:32,636
Okay?

269
00:33:23,566 --> 00:33:24,760
I'm sorry, Daddy.

270
00:33:33,843 --> 00:33:35,435
You know I love you, don't you?

271
00:33:39,215 --> 00:33:43,242
What do you think Mommy would say
if she saw us like this?

272
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:48,757
I'm gonna go get ready for school.

273
00:34:11,747 --> 00:34:12,736
Daddy!

274
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:33,094
Hello?

275
00:34:38,908 --> 00:34:40,773
Hello?

276
00:34:56,826 --> 00:34:58,623
Hey!

277
00:36:15,037 --> 00:36:17,232
All right, John.
I need you to look at my nose.

278
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,398
Right here.

279
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:22,036
Look at my nose, please?

280
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,806
Follow my flashlight.

281
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,980
Tell me if you feel any pain, all right?

282
00:36:35,091 --> 00:36:36,058
That hurt?

283
00:36:42,064 --> 00:36:43,588
It's begun.

284
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:46,894
He's out of the box.

285
00:36:52,808 --> 00:36:53,797
So?

286
00:36:55,378 --> 00:36:57,812
My 20-second analysis
without any medical equipment

287
00:36:57,913 --> 00:36:59,278
is that his brain's herniating.

288
00:37:01,484 --> 00:37:04,817
He needs to go to the hospital
and have an operation

289
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,785
to decompress his brain.

290
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:08,652
Come here.

291
00:37:08,758 --> 00:37:11,556
- No, really. Come here.
- What?

292
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,718
- Come here.
- No.

293
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:15,319
- Let me ask you something.
- Oh, God!

294
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:18,127
Did I bring John to you...

295
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:21,863
or did I bring your self-centered ass to him?

296
00:37:21,971 --> 00:37:25,737
You better start
fuckin' paying attention.

297
00:37:25,841 --> 00:37:28,810
No one's going to any hospital.

298
00:37:31,647 --> 00:37:33,080
I can't perform miracles.

299
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:35,013
You're-- You're giving him painkillers.

300
00:37:35,117 --> 00:37:37,312
For a tumor like this,
he needs steroids, Prednisone.

301
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,409
Oh, good. Yeah.

302
00:37:38,521 --> 00:37:40,318
Maybe we could try
some corticoid steroids,

303
00:37:40,423 --> 00:37:42,288
you know,
like Dexamethasone.

304
00:37:42,391 --> 00:37:44,723
Why don't you fuckin' tell me something
that I don't know,

305
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:47,318
you stupid cunt?

306
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:52,163
The only place that he can get
those drugs is in a hospital.

307
00:37:54,637 --> 00:37:55,968
Or else he's gonna die.

308
00:37:58,741 --> 00:38:01,676
You are not a good listener.

309
00:38:01,777 --> 00:38:05,269
I think you missed the part
that if he dies...

310
00:38:06,415 --> 00:38:07,973
you die.

311
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:11,109
You're asking me
to do the impossible.

312
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:14,519
I'm not asking you. He is.

313
00:38:14,623 --> 00:38:17,023
He chose you.

314
00:38:19,995 --> 00:38:21,758
- Not me.
- Amanda!

315
00:38:23,098 --> 00:38:26,499
Our doctor can't do
what's being asked of her

316
00:38:26,602 --> 00:38:28,661
if you're threatening her.

317
00:38:28,771 --> 00:38:32,571
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

318
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:35,838
You need to abide by those rules.

319
00:38:35,945 --> 00:38:36,912
Sorry.

320
00:38:56,699 --> 00:38:59,862
Amanda!
Amanda, I need your help!

321
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:02,494
Amanda, he needs oxygen!

322
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:04,698
Oxygen, Amanda!

323
00:39:04,807 --> 00:39:06,240
Put the mask on his face.

324
00:39:10,846 --> 00:39:12,177
Okay, now hold him down.

325
00:39:13,349 --> 00:39:15,749
Tip his head to the side.
You got it?

326
00:39:32,868 --> 00:39:34,130
What are you doing?

327
00:39:34,236 --> 00:39:37,000
Ativan!
Do you have Ativan?

328
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:38,334
No!

329
00:39:40,209 --> 00:39:41,176
Back off! Back off!

330
00:39:41,277 --> 00:39:42,904
Back off! Back off!

331
00:39:45,381 --> 00:39:46,746
Stay with me, John.

332
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:48,783
You're almost through this.
Stay with me.

333
00:39:53,656 --> 00:39:55,988
Stay with me.
We're almost done with this.

334
00:40:20,783 --> 00:40:22,478
Was that enough for you?

335
00:40:22,585 --> 00:40:24,382
Are you ready to go
to the hospital now?

336
00:40:26,689 --> 00:40:31,126
He needs to have an operation.

337
00:40:31,226 --> 00:40:33,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

338
00:40:33,929 --> 00:40:36,124
But we do it here.

339
00:40:36,231 --> 00:40:37,858
- We do it here.
- What?

340
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,958
What do you need?

341
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:42,560
I need anesthetic
for a procedure like this.

342
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:43,695
Anesthetic.
What else?

343
00:40:43,806 --> 00:40:45,296
Even with an anesthetic--

344
00:40:45,407 --> 00:40:47,068
Anesthetic!
What else?

345
00:40:50,145 --> 00:40:51,612
A power drill.

346
00:42:39,388 --> 00:42:42,016
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

347
00:42:43,959 --> 00:42:48,328
Please, please.
Let me go.

348
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:53,060
Please. Why... Why are you
doing this to me?

349
00:42:53,168 --> 00:42:56,797
Don't... Don't kill me.
Okay? Please!

350
00:42:56,905 --> 00:42:58,429
Wait. The key. Key.

351
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,270
Key. Okay.
Come on.

352
00:43:01,376 --> 00:43:02,468
Fuck!

353
00:43:03,512 --> 00:43:05,241
Fuck!

354
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:11,381
Please. I'm so cold.
I can't feel my arms.

355
00:43:19,061 --> 00:43:21,325
Welcome to your first test, Jeff.

356
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:24,627
For the past three years,
you've cursed the name

357
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,701
of all those you thought
were responsible

358
00:43:26,802 --> 00:43:29,202
for the death of your son.

359
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:33,434
You fantasize those accountable will pay.

360
00:43:33,542 --> 00:43:37,410
Well, you will find a woman in front of you
chained in place.

361
00:43:37,513 --> 00:43:39,606
This will prevent her from running...

362
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:42,946
much like she did
on the day your son was hit.

363
00:43:46,989 --> 00:43:49,116
Her name is Danica Scott.

364
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:50,782
She was the only witness present

365
00:43:50,893 --> 00:43:53,657
at the scene
of your son's untimely demise.

366
00:44:00,302 --> 00:44:04,102
If not for her own self-absorption
and cowardice,

367
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:08,609
she could have brought
your son's killer to justice.

368
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,113
Now it is you who has a chance
to bring her to justice.

369
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:19,420
You alone can grant her the gift of life
before she freezes to death.

370
00:44:19,521 --> 00:44:21,955
Behind the pipes
on the back wall

371
00:44:22,057 --> 00:44:24,821
you will find the key that
will free her and bring you

372
00:44:24,927 --> 00:44:26,326
one step closer to the man

373
00:44:26,428 --> 00:44:29,090
responsible for the loss
of your child.

374
00:44:30,032 --> 00:44:33,331
Will you claim the key
to save only yourself?

375
00:44:33,435 --> 00:44:35,062
Help me!

376
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,833
Or can you find it within you
to save another?

377
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:41,471
Make your choice.

378
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:12,399
I didn't do anything.

379
00:45:13,976 --> 00:45:16,035
I didn't do anything to you!

380
00:45:16,144 --> 00:45:18,772
That's exactly it.
You didn't do anything.

381
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:23,977
I'm fucking... dying.

382
00:45:24,086 --> 00:45:25,417
He died!

383
00:45:27,089 --> 00:45:28,181
In my arms.

384
00:45:29,324 --> 00:45:33,317
My eight-year-old son
died in my arms.

385
00:46:00,822 --> 00:46:04,417
I made a m-m-mistake.

386
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,223
I'm so sorry.

387
00:46:07,329 --> 00:46:09,194
I'm human.

388
00:46:09,298 --> 00:46:12,756
I'm human,
just like your son was. Okay?

389
00:46:16,038 --> 00:46:17,005
Look at me.

390
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:20,804
I said, look at me.
Look...

391
00:46:23,979 --> 00:46:25,606
Oh, my God.

392
00:46:25,714 --> 00:46:26,806
Oh, my God.

393
00:46:26,915 --> 00:46:29,076
It's so cold.

394
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:48,287
Oh, God!

395
00:49:49,251 --> 00:49:53,153
Amanda, if you really care about John,

396
00:49:53,255 --> 00:49:55,120
you won't let me do this to him.

397
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:56,451
You're a smart woman,

398
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:57,786
and you know what's right for him.

399
00:49:57,893 --> 00:49:58,951
I'm sorry.

400
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:00,789
I know it's hard to concentrate

401
00:50:00,896 --> 00:50:03,626
when you're surrounded by so many things
you could kill me with,

402
00:50:03,732 --> 00:50:06,166
like this ax I saw you lookin' at.

403
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:09,127
Take it.

404
00:50:09,237 --> 00:50:11,000
Please, it's yours.

405
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,029
Come on.

406
00:50:15,010 --> 00:50:16,136
I'd go for the neck,

407
00:50:16,244 --> 00:50:18,405
but I'm not the brain surgeon.

408
00:50:18,513 --> 00:50:20,981
Just do it quietly
so John doesn't hear me die.

409
00:50:21,082 --> 00:50:22,549
Otherwise he's likely
to get upset,

410
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:24,243
rip off his heart rate monitor.

411
00:50:24,352 --> 00:50:25,182
Boom.

412
00:50:25,287 --> 00:50:28,256
Then you just have to
find the sensor and disarm it

413
00:50:28,356 --> 00:50:30,756
so you can walk more
than 30 feet out that door

414
00:50:30,859 --> 00:50:32,850
without the collar detonating.

415
00:50:32,961 --> 00:50:36,419
Or you could try and take
the collar off yourself.

416
00:50:36,531 --> 00:50:37,793
But that could be tricky.

417
00:50:37,899 --> 00:50:41,335
The slightest knock
in the wrong place could trigger it.

418
00:50:41,436 --> 00:50:42,425
I should know.

419
00:50:46,041 --> 00:50:47,008
I built it.

420
00:50:50,845 --> 00:50:55,145
So, do you have
everything you need?

421
00:50:56,551 --> 00:50:58,712
I have the instruments
to cut someone open.

422
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:02,620
I don't have the tools
to save a life.

423
00:51:02,724 --> 00:51:05,522
You'd be surprised
what tools can save a life.

424
00:51:52,574 --> 00:51:54,565
Hello, Amanda.

425
00:51:54,676 --> 00:51:58,237
You don't know me, but...
I know you.

426
00:52:00,115 --> 00:52:01,514
I want to play a game.

427
00:52:03,985 --> 00:52:06,920
There is only one key
to open the device.

428
00:52:11,092 --> 00:52:13,390
It's in the stomach
of your dead cellmate.

429
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:19,926
Look around, Amanda.

430
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:23,368
Know that I'm not playing.

431
00:52:23,471 --> 00:52:25,405
Live or die.

432
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:27,372
Make your choice.

433
00:52:33,581 --> 00:52:35,173
Congratulations.

434
00:52:35,283 --> 00:52:37,080
You are still alive.

435
00:52:37,986 --> 00:52:42,320
Most people are so ungrateful
to be alive,

436
00:52:42,424 --> 00:52:46,121
but not you, not anymore.

437
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:50,493
Amanda, do not be afraid.

438
00:52:50,598 --> 00:52:52,725
Your life has just begun.

439
00:53:10,652 --> 00:53:13,120
He made it through
the freezer room.

440
00:53:16,458 --> 00:53:18,085
He tried to save her.

441
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:37,003
There are some things
I need you to do for me.

442
00:53:37,112 --> 00:53:42,049
In my desk...
in the center drawer,

443
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:44,050
an envelope...

444
00:53:44,152 --> 00:53:46,279
with your name on it.

445
00:53:50,158 --> 00:53:53,559
She's gonna do a procedure on you.

446
00:53:53,661 --> 00:53:55,060
Yeah.

447
00:53:55,163 --> 00:53:56,630
To relieve the pressure
on your brain.

448
00:53:56,731 --> 00:53:57,629
Yeah.

449
00:53:57,732 --> 00:53:59,632
And help with the headaches.

450
00:54:09,010 --> 00:54:10,068
I can't do this.

451
00:54:10,178 --> 00:54:12,408
Amanda... you can.

452
00:54:12,514 --> 00:54:14,448
You can.

453
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:16,141
You're stronger now.

454
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,844
And I believe in you.

455
00:54:26,027 --> 00:54:28,587
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?

456
00:54:30,698 --> 00:54:32,825
That's one reason I chose her.

457
00:56:22,977 --> 00:56:25,104
Damn it!

458
00:56:25,213 --> 00:56:27,272
Hello?

459
00:56:27,382 --> 00:56:29,509
Help me, please!

460
00:56:33,254 --> 00:56:35,017
Please, help me!

461
00:56:37,926 --> 00:56:39,894
I'm in here!

462
00:56:42,764 --> 00:56:44,561
Please get me out of here.

463
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:47,601
Help me. I--

464
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,331
Hello?

465
00:56:54,709 --> 00:56:55,733
I know you're there.

466
00:56:55,843 --> 00:56:58,573
Please!
Please help me!

467
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:05,944
I-- I can hear you.
Please, answer me!

468
00:57:06,054 --> 00:57:07,817
Help me!

469
00:57:10,258 --> 00:57:11,520
Please!

470
00:57:12,226 --> 00:57:13,955
Help me.

471
00:57:16,831 --> 00:57:18,822
Get me out of here, please.

472
00:57:18,933 --> 00:57:19,900
Please help me.

473
00:57:20,001 --> 00:57:21,468
Get me out of here!

474
00:57:21,569 --> 00:57:22,558
Please!

475
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:25,030
Don't just stand there!

476
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:26,538
Help me!

477
00:57:30,745 --> 00:57:34,203
Jeff, when the judge
presiding over your case

478
00:57:34,315 --> 00:57:37,716
sentenced your boy's
murderer so lightly,

479
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:39,787
your soul never recovered.

480
00:57:39,887 --> 00:57:44,290
Now you have the power to sentence
his soul straight to Hell.

481
00:57:44,392 --> 00:57:46,553
Or you can forgive.

482
00:57:46,661 --> 00:57:51,564
The key that will free him
is hidden inside your son's possessions--

483
00:57:51,666 --> 00:57:55,033
Possessions you have clung to
for far too long.

484
00:57:55,136 --> 00:57:59,732
Now, if you flip the switch
on the incinerator underneath you,

485
00:57:59,841 --> 00:58:02,207
a fire will cleanse you
of this obsession

486
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,902
and destroy them all,

487
00:58:04,012 --> 00:58:06,572
leaving only the key remaining.

488
00:58:06,681 --> 00:58:08,615
It is also the key
that will bring you closer

489
00:58:08,716 --> 00:58:12,243
to the man accountable
for taking your child.

490
00:58:12,353 --> 00:58:14,583
He doesn't have much time, Jeff.

491
00:58:14,689 --> 00:58:15,621
Let the game begin.

492
00:58:15,723 --> 00:58:16,621
Please, get me out of here.

493
00:58:16,724 --> 00:58:18,282
Please!

494
00:58:22,196 --> 00:58:23,823
What is that?

495
00:58:30,038 --> 00:58:31,164
What's that sound?

496
00:59:10,411 --> 00:59:13,312
I'm a criminal court judge,
for Christ's sake!

497
00:59:13,414 --> 00:59:14,540
You can't do this to me!

498
00:59:17,085 --> 00:59:18,245
You don't remember me?

499
00:59:22,757 --> 00:59:25,225
Well, maybe you remember
Timothy Young?

500
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,633
He was the driver
who killed my son.

501
00:59:35,737 --> 00:59:37,864
You gave him six months!

502
00:59:38,573 --> 00:59:40,370
Okay. All right.

503
00:59:40,475 --> 00:59:41,703
We can talk about your case.

504
00:59:41,809 --> 00:59:44,039
Obviously you want answers.

505
00:59:44,145 --> 00:59:46,238
I can't give them to you like this.

506
00:59:47,248 --> 00:59:48,408
This hurts!

507
00:59:50,017 --> 00:59:52,212
You gave more for
fuckin' parking tickets!

508
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,480
Listen to me.

509
00:59:53,588 --> 00:59:56,887
I can see that you're
in a great deal of pain,

510
00:59:56,991 --> 01:00:00,188
but there are ways that we can have
his sentence extended.

511
01:00:00,294 --> 01:00:01,488
I can help you!

512
01:00:01,596 --> 01:00:03,791
It's too late!

513
01:00:03,898 --> 01:00:05,866
They let him go!

514
01:00:05,967 --> 01:00:07,730
Don't become what he is!

515
01:00:09,303 --> 01:00:11,203
Don't become a killer!

516
01:00:11,305 --> 01:00:14,433
Please!
I have a son, too.

517
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:24,679
Where are you going?

518
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:29,212
You gotta help me!

519
01:00:33,828 --> 01:00:35,386
I'm so sorry!

520
01:00:40,368 --> 01:00:41,733
Oh, God.

521
01:00:43,171 --> 01:00:44,798
You're killing me!

522
01:00:46,674 --> 01:00:49,973
Don't do this to me!
I'm gonna die!

523
01:00:56,684 --> 01:00:57,480
Fuck you!

524
01:00:58,986 --> 01:01:00,613
Fuck you, you--

525
01:01:01,122 --> 01:01:02,282
You gotta help me!

526
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,823
Shut the fuck up.

527
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,407
Help!

528
01:02:44,492 --> 01:02:45,550
Come on!

529
01:03:38,145 --> 01:03:41,603
He made it through
the second test.

530
01:03:41,716 --> 01:03:44,981
The judge is alive.

531
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:46,644
Faster than I expected.

532
01:03:46,754 --> 01:03:49,780
All right, John, I need you
to keep your head to the side

533
01:03:49,890 --> 01:03:51,881
and keep still.

534
01:03:51,993 --> 01:03:53,824
What's goin' on here
is that your brain

535
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:55,555
is pushing
against your skull.

536
01:03:55,663 --> 01:03:58,496
I'm gonna try
to relieve the pressure

537
01:03:58,599 --> 01:04:00,226
by cutting away
a little bit of your skull.

538
01:04:00,334 --> 01:04:02,894
It should help you
with your headaches

539
01:04:03,004 --> 01:04:05,495
and drastically improve
your motor skills.

540
01:04:05,606 --> 01:04:06,732
Do you understand?

541
01:04:06,841 --> 01:04:10,106
All too well.

542
01:04:18,452 --> 01:04:22,354
All right, you're gonna feel
some slight discomfort.

543
01:04:22,456 --> 01:04:24,617
Are you gonna give him
a general anesthetic?

544
01:04:24,725 --> 01:04:26,215
For a procedure like this,

545
01:04:26,327 --> 01:04:28,295
the patient needs to be
fully alert.

546
01:04:36,504 --> 01:04:37,835
Okay.

547
01:05:17,878 --> 01:05:19,505
Amanda, I need you here.

548
01:05:21,248 --> 01:05:22,237
Amanda.

549
01:05:24,385 --> 01:05:29,152
All right, John,
you're gonna feel some pressure.

550
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:42,298
Let's clamp this.
Stop the bleeding.

551
01:05:55,349 --> 01:05:57,510
Fill that syringe
with alcohol from that bowl.

552
01:06:02,957 --> 01:06:04,151
Hurry.

553
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:15,861
All right, John,
I need you to keep your mouth closed.

554
01:06:15,970 --> 01:06:17,767
You're gonna hear
a lot of noise.

555
01:07:16,864 --> 01:07:17,922
John, how you doin'?

556
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:19,932
Never better.

557
01:07:22,069 --> 01:07:23,036
All right.

558
01:07:33,647 --> 01:07:36,707
All right,
you're gonna hear a lot of ringing.

559
01:07:36,817 --> 01:07:39,217
I need you to stay very still.

560
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:41,288
Here I go.

561
01:08:25,032 --> 01:08:28,331
All right, John,
I'm gonna remove the skull.

562
01:08:54,061 --> 01:08:55,585
He's stabilized.

563
01:08:57,898 --> 01:08:59,126
John, I need you
to raise your hand

564
01:08:59,233 --> 01:09:00,598
and flex your fingers.

565
01:09:07,808 --> 01:09:09,400
John?

566
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:11,307
John, raise your hand...
hand...

567
01:09:14,181 --> 01:09:15,648
John, can you hear me?

568
01:09:18,185 --> 01:09:19,516
What's happening?

569
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,012
John.

570
01:09:23,123 --> 01:09:24,454
What's happening to him?

571
01:09:24,558 --> 01:09:26,651
What's happening?

572
01:09:28,696 --> 01:09:29,993
What's wrong?

573
01:09:37,037 --> 01:09:38,334
What's wrong?

574
01:09:40,374 --> 01:09:43,104
Why isn't he moving?

575
01:09:43,210 --> 01:09:44,905
Do something!

576
01:09:45,012 --> 01:09:46,502
Please.

577
01:09:50,217 --> 01:09:51,343
Stay with me, John.

578
01:09:54,888 --> 01:09:57,288
Good.

579
01:09:57,391 --> 01:09:59,120
- I love you.
- I love you.

580
01:09:59,226 --> 01:10:02,252
Breathe!
Breathe, damn it.

581
01:10:02,363 --> 01:10:03,955
Breathe, John.

582
01:10:04,064 --> 01:10:05,395
I love...

583
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:07,126
Breathe.

584
01:10:11,905 --> 01:10:14,465
I...

585
01:10:14,575 --> 01:10:16,873
I love you.

586
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:52,078
You will give everything to me.

587
01:10:54,615 --> 01:10:56,082
Every cell in your body.

588
01:10:58,452 --> 01:10:59,476
Is that understood?

589
01:11:00,788 --> 01:11:01,777
Yes.

590
01:11:05,459 --> 01:11:10,123
The marks on your arms...
they're from another life.

591
01:11:10,230 --> 01:11:12,790
We'll leave that life behind.

592
01:11:15,969 --> 01:11:17,937
When you go down
that corridor...

593
01:11:23,143 --> 01:11:24,701
there is no turning back.

594
01:11:24,812 --> 01:11:26,643
Do you understand that?

595
01:11:28,315 --> 01:11:29,839
Yes.

596
01:11:31,151 --> 01:11:32,618
Then start with this.

597
01:11:44,498 --> 01:11:45,795
Go.

598
01:12:09,356 --> 01:12:11,586
Who is that?

599
01:12:11,692 --> 01:12:12,886
Who's in there?

600
01:12:14,194 --> 01:12:15,661
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

601
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:19,666
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

602
01:13:32,873 --> 01:13:34,966
Put his left leg in the shackle.

603
01:15:00,427 --> 01:15:02,793
It's time to start our game.

604
01:15:31,358 --> 01:15:32,655
What's that?

605
01:15:32,759 --> 01:15:35,284
Slow my heart rate.

606
01:15:35,395 --> 01:15:37,556
Relax my muscles.

607
01:15:42,069 --> 01:15:43,627
It's time.

608
01:15:47,374 --> 01:15:49,706
Close the door behind you.

609
01:17:29,776 --> 01:17:31,676
He can't hear you.

610
01:17:31,778 --> 01:17:34,008
He doesn't even know you're there.

611
01:17:43,924 --> 01:17:45,414
Amanda.

612
01:17:46,159 --> 01:17:48,127
Put... it... away.

613
01:17:48,228 --> 01:17:49,855
Trust me.

614
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:52,495
Put it away.

615
01:17:56,603 --> 01:17:58,468
Leave us alone.

616
01:17:59,906 --> 01:18:01,931
Now.

617
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:03,771
You fucking freak.

618
01:18:05,345 --> 01:18:07,939
I apologize for her behavior.

619
01:18:09,549 --> 01:18:11,483
She swims in my sea.

620
01:18:12,986 --> 01:18:15,216
In the end,
she will be the closest

621
01:18:15,322 --> 01:18:18,223
I've ever come to a connection,

622
01:18:18,325 --> 01:18:19,792
to being understood.

623
01:18:22,662 --> 01:18:27,122
But her emotion
is also her... weakness.

624
01:19:14,547 --> 01:19:15,514
Adam.

625
01:19:17,550 --> 01:19:18,608
Adam.

626
01:19:27,294 --> 01:19:28,955
Come here.

627
01:19:29,062 --> 01:19:30,359
I'm gonna help you.

628
01:19:31,898 --> 01:19:33,195
I'm gonna help you.

629
01:19:38,071 --> 01:19:39,698
I'm gonna free you.

630
01:20:09,235 --> 01:20:10,429
Adam!

631
01:21:05,892 --> 01:21:08,622
I'm so sorry about your son, Jeff.

632
01:21:10,563 --> 01:21:13,225
But let me tell you something that I...

633
01:21:13,333 --> 01:21:14,561
that I know for sure.

634
01:21:14,667 --> 01:21:18,603
No sentence I gave him,
not 500 years,

635
01:21:18,705 --> 01:21:23,574
not even death, nothing,
will take your pain away.

636
01:21:23,676 --> 01:21:26,736
And vengeance doesn't
solve anything.

637
01:21:26,846 --> 01:21:29,974
It only makes
the pain greater, Jeff.

638
01:21:52,038 --> 01:21:53,903
What the...
What the fuck?

639
01:21:55,708 --> 01:21:57,039
Somebody, help me!

640
01:21:58,745 --> 01:22:00,440
What the fuck?

641
01:22:03,550 --> 01:22:04,847
Help.

642
01:22:10,390 --> 01:22:13,188
What the fu--
What the fuck are you doin'?

643
01:22:15,495 --> 01:22:16,462
Please help me.

644
01:22:18,898 --> 01:22:20,126
Hello, Jeff.

645
01:22:20,233 --> 01:22:21,860
If you are listening to this,

646
01:22:21,968 --> 01:22:26,803
that means that the confrontation
you so long dreamed of

647
01:22:26,906 --> 01:22:28,464
is finally unfolding.

648
01:22:28,575 --> 01:22:30,304
Do something!

649
01:22:30,410 --> 01:22:33,140
In your head he is a cipher,

650
01:22:33,246 --> 01:22:35,407
a symbol of your life changing,

651
01:22:35,515 --> 01:22:36,812
a symbol of death.

652
01:22:36,916 --> 01:22:42,320
I present him to you now
as a simple human being.

653
01:22:42,422 --> 01:22:43,821
His name is Timothy Young.

654
01:22:43,923 --> 01:22:45,652
He's 27 years old,

655
01:22:45,758 --> 01:22:48,318
a medical student
with a mother and a father

656
01:22:48,428 --> 01:22:50,225
just like you,

657
01:22:50,330 --> 01:22:54,096
a man whose life also changed
the day your son died.

658
01:22:58,638 --> 01:23:01,004
That day he made
a terrible mistake.

659
01:23:06,746 --> 01:23:08,577
You believed he didn't pay
for that mistake,

660
01:23:08,681 --> 01:23:11,980
and now is your chance
to make him pay.

661
01:23:12,085 --> 01:23:16,920
The device Timothy is strapped to
is my personal favorite.

662
01:23:17,023 --> 01:23:18,320
I call it the rack.

663
01:23:24,063 --> 01:23:27,590
The human body
is a miraculous creation.

664
01:23:27,700 --> 01:23:31,431
Ever wonder how far
the arm can twist?

665
01:23:31,538 --> 01:23:34,439
This device is going
to start twisting.

666
01:23:34,541 --> 01:23:37,271
There is a chance he might live,
though, with your help.

667
01:23:37,377 --> 01:23:38,275
Please...

668
01:23:38,378 --> 01:23:41,108
To your right is a box.

669
01:23:41,214 --> 01:23:43,148
At the back of the box is a key.

670
01:23:43,249 --> 01:23:45,945
It's tied to the trigger of a shotgun.

671
01:23:46,052 --> 01:23:48,452
The question you have to
ask yourself is this...

672
01:23:50,657 --> 01:23:51,624
Are you willing...

673
01:23:51,724 --> 01:23:53,123
Have mercy!

674
01:23:53,226 --> 01:23:56,718
...to take a bullet for the man
who killed your son?

675
01:23:56,829 --> 01:23:59,457
Does "Do unto others as you
would have them do unto you"

676
01:23:59,566 --> 01:24:01,329
apply here, Jeff?

677
01:24:01,434 --> 01:24:02,924
Make your choice.

678
01:24:52,285 --> 01:24:53,718
My God.

679
01:25:03,096 --> 01:25:05,257
You've got to help him, Jeff!

680
01:25:12,505 --> 01:25:13,529
Fuck me!

681
01:25:13,640 --> 01:25:15,665
Please stop! Stop!

682
01:25:15,775 --> 01:25:18,107
Stop! Please stop!

683
01:25:33,259 --> 01:25:34,556
Jeff!

684
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:40,529
Jeff!

685
01:25:40,633 --> 01:25:43,966
Just standing there
you're an accomplice to murder!

686
01:25:44,070 --> 01:25:45,094
Are you a murderer?

687
01:25:46,139 --> 01:25:48,471
I've wanted
to kill him every day.

688
01:25:48,574 --> 01:25:49,541
Oh, my God!

689
01:25:49,642 --> 01:25:53,305
For three years,
I wanted to kill you.

690
01:25:53,413 --> 01:25:54,880
Yeah, maybe I am.

691
01:25:54,981 --> 01:25:56,414
You'll lose your family.

692
01:25:56,516 --> 01:25:57,574
Oh, my God!

693
01:25:57,684 --> 01:25:58,912
Your wife, your daughter.

694
01:25:59,018 --> 01:26:01,009
I killed him.

695
01:26:02,855 --> 01:26:04,288
Fuck!

696
01:26:15,001 --> 01:26:15,968
Oh, God.

697
01:26:18,938 --> 01:26:20,803
Okay.

698
01:26:23,242 --> 01:26:24,573
Hold on, son.

699
01:26:47,433 --> 01:26:49,867
Hold on. Don't give up.

700
01:26:49,969 --> 01:26:50,993
Come on, son.

701
01:26:52,939 --> 01:26:55,134
Oh, God! Oh, God!

702
01:26:55,808 --> 01:26:57,070
Son.

703
01:27:08,621 --> 01:27:09,952
Got the key.

704
01:27:25,405 --> 01:27:27,498
Help me!

705
01:27:27,607 --> 01:27:28,665
Help me!

706
01:27:37,150 --> 01:27:38,117
Help me!

707
01:27:38,217 --> 01:27:39,206
Stop!

708
01:27:40,586 --> 01:27:42,053
I forgive him!

709
01:27:45,091 --> 01:27:47,855
I forgive him! No!

710
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:51,088
No!

711
01:27:51,197 --> 01:27:52,221
God!

712
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,594
God damn you!

713
01:28:29,936 --> 01:28:31,961
Don't you think it would be wise

714
01:28:32,071 --> 01:28:36,474
to engage me in conversation
for your own sake?

715
01:28:36,576 --> 01:28:38,066
I asked you to tell me
about your husband.

716
01:28:42,482 --> 01:28:44,746
It's like we're strangers now.

717
01:28:44,851 --> 01:28:47,183
And?

718
01:28:47,286 --> 01:28:51,882
The last time I saw him,
we were so disconnected.

719
01:28:51,991 --> 01:28:53,151
But now...

720
01:28:55,862 --> 01:28:59,923
I'd give anything in the world...

721
01:29:03,636 --> 01:29:06,002
...to see my husband.

722
01:29:06,105 --> 01:29:08,437
Matrimony's always
fascinated me.

723
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:10,975
Husbands barely able
to look at their wives,

724
01:29:11,077 --> 01:29:12,442
wives on their backs

725
01:29:12,545 --> 01:29:15,878
in motel rooms
with perfect strangers,

726
01:29:15,982 --> 01:29:18,644
people who bear children
only to neglect them.

727
01:29:18,751 --> 01:29:21,379
Till death do us part, indeed.

728
01:29:21,487 --> 01:29:24,718
I don't know
what you think you know,

729
01:29:24,824 --> 01:29:27,554
but my marriage has
survived more suffering

730
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:30,128
than someone like you
could ever grasp.

731
01:29:30,229 --> 01:29:31,196
Suffering?

732
01:29:32,832 --> 01:29:34,459
You haven't seen anything yet.

733
01:29:37,603 --> 01:29:39,264
Someone like me?
Who am I?

734
01:29:39,372 --> 01:29:41,738
A monster.

735
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:42,773
A murderer.

736
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:44,399
I don't condone murder,

737
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:48,105
and I... despise murderers.

738
01:29:48,214 --> 01:29:50,739
Please.

739
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:58,850
Please... let me go.

740
01:30:05,798 --> 01:30:06,730
We're fine, Amanda.

741
01:30:06,832 --> 01:30:08,766
We don't need you.

742
01:30:13,172 --> 01:30:14,264
I said, we're fine.

743
01:30:27,520 --> 01:30:29,078
If you make it through this, Lynn,

744
01:30:29,188 --> 01:30:31,622
you're gonna thank me one day
just as Amanda did.

745
01:30:39,465 --> 01:30:42,195
Please, let me go.

746
01:30:42,301 --> 01:30:45,759
I saved your life.

747
01:30:45,871 --> 01:30:48,931
Maybe my life isn't the one
you were saving after all.

748
01:30:53,379 --> 01:30:55,108
Tell me about your daughter.

749
01:30:55,214 --> 01:30:57,682
I understand she's quite
a little athlete.

750
01:31:04,256 --> 01:31:06,781
Or we could talk about your son.

751
01:31:06,892 --> 01:31:08,223
What did you say?

752
01:31:12,164 --> 01:31:13,631
Why are you living with the dead

753
01:31:13,733 --> 01:31:15,826
when you have such
a beautiful family,

754
01:31:15,935 --> 01:31:20,133
a husband who is indeed alone,

755
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:22,571
a daughter who needs her mother,

756
01:31:22,675 --> 01:31:26,133
patients who need
a competent physician

757
01:31:26,245 --> 01:31:28,110
who looks them in the eye

758
01:31:28,214 --> 01:31:30,444
and treats them
like human beings?

759
01:31:30,549 --> 01:31:32,574
He's completed the third test.

760
01:31:32,685 --> 01:31:35,051
Congratulations, Lynn.

761
01:31:35,154 --> 01:31:36,246
You're free to go.

762
01:31:37,990 --> 01:31:40,151
Yeah, but he's not
all the way out yet.

763
01:31:41,794 --> 01:31:44,763
Undo her collar, Amanda,
and let her go.

764
01:31:44,864 --> 01:31:47,492
No, he's not finished.

765
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:49,158
He's not all the way.

766
01:31:49,268 --> 01:31:53,170
Amanda, Lynn is more important
than you know.

767
01:31:53,272 --> 01:31:57,265
Unlock her collar and let her go.

768
01:31:57,376 --> 01:31:59,606
I said no.

769
01:32:03,783 --> 01:32:05,341
Amanda, there are rules.

770
01:32:05,451 --> 01:32:06,679
I said no!

771
01:32:08,788 --> 01:32:10,688
She doesn't deserve to go free.

772
01:32:10,790 --> 01:32:11,757
You promised.

773
01:32:11,857 --> 01:32:13,290
I didn't promise you shit.

774
01:32:13,392 --> 01:32:15,883
Amanda, even with that gun,

775
01:32:15,995 --> 01:32:21,058
it is Lynn who holds
your life in her hand.

776
01:32:21,167 --> 01:32:22,156
Fuck you.

777
01:32:22,268 --> 01:32:24,498
You give her control over me?

778
01:32:24,603 --> 01:32:25,968
Fuck you!

779
01:32:26,072 --> 01:32:28,165
I won't tell anyone.
I promise I won't.

780
01:32:28,274 --> 01:32:29,571
Please, I have a family.

781
01:32:29,675 --> 01:32:32,337
Shut up, shut up,
shut up, shut up!

782
01:32:32,445 --> 01:32:34,470
And stop fuckin' moving around!

783
01:32:34,580 --> 01:32:38,016
And what about the other
test subjects that we left alive?

784
01:32:38,117 --> 01:32:38,947
Game over.

785
01:32:39,051 --> 01:32:40,780
I'll fucking kill you!

786
01:32:40,886 --> 01:32:42,285
What about them?

787
01:32:42,388 --> 01:32:44,618
Was that how you felt about them?

788
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:49,894
Was that how you felt
about Eric Matthews?

789
01:32:49,995 --> 01:32:51,019
Eric Matthews.

790
01:32:51,130 --> 01:32:52,290
<i>Let me go.</i>

791
01:32:52,398 --> 01:32:56,095
I'll tell you how I felt
about Eric Matthews.

792
01:33:24,764 --> 01:33:26,527
Daniel!

793
01:33:31,103 --> 01:33:31,899
Fuck.

794
01:33:32,004 --> 01:33:33,869
Daniel!

795
01:33:46,018 --> 01:33:47,781
Daniel?

796
01:34:17,750 --> 01:34:18,944
Fuck!

797
01:35:26,518 --> 01:35:27,951
Where's my son?

798
01:35:30,356 --> 01:35:32,722
Where is he, you junkie bitch?

799
01:35:36,729 --> 01:35:38,196
Where is he?

800
01:35:51,911 --> 01:35:53,811
Tell me where he is.

801
01:35:53,913 --> 01:35:55,574
Tell me where he is.

802
01:35:55,681 --> 01:35:57,342
Right fuckin' here.

803
01:36:16,101 --> 01:36:17,625
You bitch!

804
01:36:22,341 --> 01:36:24,366
You're nothin', bitch!

805
01:36:26,645 --> 01:36:28,772
You're nothing!

806
01:36:34,086 --> 01:36:35,781
You're not Jigsaw.

807
01:36:39,892 --> 01:36:42,383
You're not Jigsaw, bitch!

808
01:36:52,137 --> 01:36:54,002
You hear me?

809
01:36:54,907 --> 01:36:56,431
You're nothing!

810
01:36:59,011 --> 01:37:01,275
You're not Jigsaw, bitch.

811
01:37:04,683 --> 01:37:06,275
You're nothin'!

812
01:37:09,855 --> 01:37:12,619
I'll fuckin' kill you!

813
01:37:12,725 --> 01:37:13,692
No!

814
01:37:14,059 --> 01:37:15,492
That's right.

815
01:37:15,594 --> 01:37:17,892
I'm a murderer.

816
01:37:17,997 --> 01:37:20,522
He took my life from me,

817
01:37:20,632 --> 01:37:22,862
so I just returned
the fuckin' favor.

818
01:37:22,968 --> 01:37:25,869
No, Amanda,
that's what you thought,

819
01:37:25,971 --> 01:37:28,439
but I know different.

820
01:37:28,540 --> 01:37:31,031
You left him for dead, didn't you?

821
01:37:31,143 --> 01:37:32,542
Stop fucking with me.

822
01:37:32,644 --> 01:37:35,875
But I cleaned up
your mistakes.

823
01:37:35,981 --> 01:37:38,245
I forgave you for them.

824
01:37:40,319 --> 01:37:42,116
Let me go! Please!

825
01:37:42,221 --> 01:37:45,213
What you do
is no different than murder.

826
01:37:45,324 --> 01:37:48,157
You torture people.
You watch them die.

827
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:51,229
But now you're begging me
not to kill this worthless bitch

828
01:37:51,330 --> 01:37:53,059
on the grounds of some game?

829
01:37:53,165 --> 01:37:55,395
You are walking us
toward a precipice, Amanda.

830
01:37:55,501 --> 01:37:57,059
Step back.

831
01:37:57,169 --> 01:37:58,466
It's bullshit.

832
01:37:58,570 --> 01:38:01,061
Nobody changes.

833
01:38:01,173 --> 01:38:02,140
It's all a lie.

834
01:38:02,241 --> 01:38:04,141
If you fail in this, we all fail.

835
01:38:04,243 --> 01:38:06,404
Succeed, and we all succeed.

836
01:38:06,512 --> 01:38:08,139
It's a lie!

837
01:38:13,519 --> 01:38:16,454
I'll tell you,
she hasn't changed,

838
01:38:16,555 --> 01:38:18,853
because nobody fuckin' changes.

839
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:22,254
Nobody is reborn.

840
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:23,487
It's all bullshit!

841
01:38:23,595 --> 01:38:25,586
It's all a fuckin' lie!

842
01:38:25,697 --> 01:38:28,495
And I'm just a pawn
in your stupid games.

843
01:38:41,547 --> 01:38:43,538
I don't mean anything to you.

844
01:38:43,649 --> 01:38:46,277
No, you mean everything to me.

845
01:38:46,385 --> 01:38:48,114
Fuck you!

846
01:38:48,220 --> 01:38:49,983
Our fates are linked.

847
01:38:51,457 --> 01:38:53,550
I've tried to help you, Amanda.

848
01:38:53,659 --> 01:38:55,524
So, help me!

849
01:38:55,627 --> 01:38:57,185
Fix me!

850
01:38:58,831 --> 01:39:00,423
Fix me, motherfucker!

851
01:39:02,167 --> 01:39:09,039
I'm standin' right here.

852
01:39:09,141 --> 01:39:10,438
Why is she so important to you?

853
01:39:11,944 --> 01:39:14,003
She's not important to me.

854
01:39:15,848 --> 01:39:17,372
She's important to you.

855
01:39:17,483 --> 01:39:19,713
She's not important to me.

856
01:39:19,818 --> 01:39:23,447
I beg you to reconsider that.

857
01:39:29,261 --> 01:39:31,126
This is your last chance, Amanda.

858
01:39:31,230 --> 01:39:32,492
She's nothing.

859
01:39:49,381 --> 01:39:51,349
Your time's running out.

860
01:39:54,987 --> 01:39:56,648
Now, you think about
what you're doing.

861
01:40:00,626 --> 01:40:02,924
Think about everything
that you've done.

862
01:40:10,469 --> 01:40:13,267
You think about
what you promised me.

863
01:40:13,372 --> 01:40:16,034
Think about our dreams.

864
01:40:16,141 --> 01:40:17,768
Think about tomorrow.

865
01:40:20,779 --> 01:40:22,246
Lynn?

866
01:40:22,347 --> 01:40:23,974
Jeff! Jeff--

867
01:40:25,117 --> 01:40:26,175
Lynn.

868
01:40:28,820 --> 01:40:30,788
Lynn.

869
01:40:30,889 --> 01:40:32,015
- Lynn.
- Jeff.

870
01:40:32,925 --> 01:40:34,586
You just destroyed four lives.

871
01:40:35,861 --> 01:40:37,556
You just murdered Jeff's wife.

872
01:40:57,549 --> 01:40:59,210
Baby.

873
01:40:59,318 --> 01:41:00,683
Amanda.

874
01:41:03,422 --> 01:41:04,389
It's okay.

875
01:41:10,529 --> 01:41:11,689
This was your test...

876
01:41:13,232 --> 01:41:14,824
...your game.

877
01:41:17,035 --> 01:41:18,400
What do I want?

878
01:41:18,503 --> 01:41:20,164
I want to play a game.

879
01:41:22,808 --> 01:41:23,934
You're being tested.

880
01:41:24,042 --> 01:41:25,168
Your will is being tested--

881
01:41:25,277 --> 01:41:27,177
Your will to keep someone alive.

882
01:41:27,279 --> 01:41:28,246
Can you do that?

883
01:41:28,347 --> 01:41:32,147
Can you follow the rules
and grant someone the gift of life?

884
01:41:34,553 --> 01:41:36,214
I was testing you.

885
01:41:36,321 --> 01:41:38,186
I took you in.

886
01:41:38,290 --> 01:41:40,281
You will give everything to me.

887
01:41:40,392 --> 01:41:41,381
Yes.

888
01:41:41,493 --> 01:41:42,551
Every cell in your body.

889
01:41:42,661 --> 01:41:47,655
I selected you for the honor
of carrying on my life's work.

890
01:41:47,766 --> 01:41:49,631
But you didn't.

891
01:41:49,735 --> 01:41:50,702
That's right.

892
01:41:52,671 --> 01:41:53,660
I'm a murderer.

893
01:41:53,772 --> 01:41:54,966
I despise murderers.

894
01:41:55,073 --> 01:41:57,303
You didn't test anyone's will to live.

895
01:41:57,409 --> 01:41:58,774
Game over.

896
01:42:00,078 --> 01:42:02,638
Instead you took away
their only chance.

897
01:42:02,748 --> 01:42:05,376
Your games were unwinnable.

898
01:42:05,484 --> 01:42:07,213
Your subjects merely victims.

899
01:42:07,319 --> 01:42:08,877
You.

900
01:42:09,821 --> 01:42:10,947
There is no turning back.

901
01:42:11,056 --> 01:42:13,047
Do you understand that?

902
01:42:13,158 --> 01:42:18,596
In my desperation,
I decided to give you one last chance.

903
01:42:18,697 --> 01:42:21,495
So I put everything in place.

904
01:42:22,868 --> 01:42:24,597
You chose her 'cause
she's the best, right?

905
01:42:24,703 --> 01:42:26,500
That's one reason I chose her.

906
01:42:26,605 --> 01:42:30,666
You didn't know that Lynn and Jeff
were husband and wife.

907
01:42:30,776 --> 01:42:35,975
I had to keep that from you
for the purposes of my game.

908
01:42:36,081 --> 01:42:38,276
I had to leave out
the ruined marriage,

909
01:42:38,383 --> 01:42:41,546
the cheating wife,

910
01:42:41,653 --> 01:42:46,386
the vengeful husband,
the neglected daughter.

911
01:42:46,491 --> 01:42:51,394
And I let you make
your own choices.

912
01:42:51,496 --> 01:42:54,693
I wanted you to succeed.

913
01:42:54,800 --> 01:42:57,826
Amanda, put it away.

914
01:42:57,936 --> 01:43:00,166
Trust me, even with that gun,

915
01:43:00,272 --> 01:43:03,935
it's Lynn who holds
your life in her hands.

916
01:43:04,042 --> 01:43:05,600
She's not important to me.

917
01:43:05,711 --> 01:43:08,236
I beg you to reconsider that.

918
01:43:08,347 --> 01:43:10,178
Unlock her collar
and let her go.

919
01:43:10,282 --> 01:43:12,614
I said no!

920
01:43:12,718 --> 01:43:14,845
The rules of our game
have been made very clear.

921
01:43:14,953 --> 01:43:17,251
You need to abide by those rules.

922
01:43:19,324 --> 01:43:20,291
You couldn't.

923
01:43:26,631 --> 01:43:28,326
God.

924
01:43:44,316 --> 01:43:45,442
Game over.

925
01:43:57,996 --> 01:44:00,055
You haven't learned anything tonight,
have you?

926
01:44:00,165 --> 01:44:04,363
Your rage and your vengeance
will only hurt the ones you love.

927
01:44:04,469 --> 01:44:07,734
Killing me will only add
to your misery.

928
01:44:07,839 --> 01:44:10,501
It will not bring back your son.

929
01:44:10,609 --> 01:44:12,577
Think of your daughter, Jeff.

930
01:44:12,677 --> 01:44:16,670
She needs you now
more than ever.

931
01:44:16,782 --> 01:44:18,773
You can't kill me, Jeff.

932
01:44:28,427 --> 01:44:30,486
Your wife's dying, Jeff.

933
01:44:30,595 --> 01:44:34,031
Her time's running out.

934
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,771
Jeff, do not miscalculate.

935
01:44:45,877 --> 01:44:47,538
Your fate is in my hands.

936
01:44:47,646 --> 01:44:50,444
Your wife's fate is in my hands.

937
01:44:50,549 --> 01:44:52,779
I love you.

938
01:44:52,884 --> 01:44:54,511
I love you.

939
01:44:58,390 --> 01:45:00,950
I'm taking you home. Okay?

940
01:45:01,059 --> 01:45:04,620
Though you may not
see any threat...

941
01:45:04,729 --> 01:45:06,993
there are threats all around you.

942
01:45:07,098 --> 01:45:09,965
Jeff, if you try to move your wife,
she will die.

943
01:45:10,068 --> 01:45:12,832
I can have an ambulance here
in four minutes.

944
01:45:12,938 --> 01:45:15,634
Would you like to take your wife
out of here tonight?

945
01:45:15,740 --> 01:45:17,230
Would you like
to take her to safety?

946
01:45:17,342 --> 01:45:18,468
Stay.

947
01:45:18,577 --> 01:45:20,101
Stand and face me, Jeff.

948
01:45:20,212 --> 01:45:23,409
- Stay with me, please.
- Right now.

949
01:45:23,515 --> 01:45:26,848
Would you like to get your life back?

950
01:45:26,952 --> 01:45:27,850
Would you, Jeff?

951
01:45:27,953 --> 01:45:29,545
I can make that happen.

952
01:45:32,057 --> 01:45:34,048
Which is it, Jeff?

953
01:45:34,159 --> 01:45:36,354
Come on... yes or no?

954
01:45:36,461 --> 01:45:37,450
Yes.

955
01:45:40,665 --> 01:45:41,927
What do you want?

956
01:45:42,033 --> 01:45:43,625
One final test.

957
01:45:43,735 --> 01:45:45,566
The rules are simple.

958
01:45:45,670 --> 01:45:49,902
Over on that table,
there's a host of vicious implements...

959
01:45:51,243 --> 01:45:54,804
which you can use
to exact your pound of flesh,

960
01:45:54,913 --> 01:45:56,244
to take your vengeance,

961
01:45:56,348 --> 01:45:59,579
to indulge your obsession.

962
01:45:59,684 --> 01:46:04,849
Or you can choose to put
your vengeance aside,

963
01:46:04,956 --> 01:46:06,981
and you can forgive.

964
01:46:08,693 --> 01:46:12,094
You can forgive me for the pain

965
01:46:12,197 --> 01:46:14,893
that I've caused you
and your wife tonight.

966
01:46:16,368 --> 01:46:17,426
Jeff.

967
01:46:17,536 --> 01:46:19,163
Which is it gonna be, Jeff?

968
01:46:23,608 --> 01:46:25,599
Honey, don't do it.

969
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:27,837
Jeff...

970
01:46:29,714 --> 01:46:31,272
It's up to you.

971
01:46:31,383 --> 01:46:32,441
I need you.

972
01:46:32,551 --> 01:46:35,611
Live or die, Jeff?

973
01:46:35,720 --> 01:46:37,517
Make our choice.

974
01:46:55,106 --> 01:46:56,198
I forgive you.

975
01:47:03,114 --> 01:47:05,480
Jeff...

976
01:47:05,584 --> 01:47:08,178
Jeff. Jeff!

977
01:47:17,195 --> 01:47:18,287
Jeff, no.

978
01:47:32,577 --> 01:47:34,670
I forgive you.

979
01:47:47,025 --> 01:47:48,788
Hello, Jeff.

980
01:47:48,893 --> 01:47:53,353
I made this tape
as an insurance policy, if you will.

981
01:47:53,465 --> 01:47:54,523
Jeff!

982
01:47:56,501 --> 01:47:59,937
And if you're listening to it,
then it's time to collect.

983
01:48:02,507 --> 01:48:05,601
I was your final test of forgiveness.

984
01:48:05,710 --> 01:48:07,405
And if you are listening to this,

985
01:48:07,512 --> 01:48:09,446
then you failed.

986
01:48:10,782 --> 01:48:14,047
Now you must pay the price...

987
01:48:14,152 --> 01:48:16,712
the price for living
for nothing but vengeance.

988
01:48:16,821 --> 01:48:20,985
Now I will give you
something to live for.

989
01:48:21,092 --> 01:48:23,822
I told you that
you couldn't kill me, Jeff,

990
01:48:23,928 --> 01:48:26,294
but I didn't tell you why,

991
01:48:26,398 --> 01:48:27,558
and the answer is simple.

992
01:48:27,666 --> 01:48:32,501
I am the person responsible
for the loss of your child.

993
01:48:32,604 --> 01:48:38,201
I am the only person who knows
where your daughter is.

994
01:48:39,110 --> 01:48:42,079
She only has a limited supply of air, Jeff,

995
01:48:42,180 --> 01:48:43,442
and if you want to get her back,

996
