1
00:01:07,947 --> 00:01:09,615
Come on!

2
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,497
<i>Look out girls, here we go. </i>

3
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:18,415
<i>Look to the left.</i>

4
00:01:18,457 --> 00:01:19,875
Paddle!

5
00:01:19,917 --> 00:01:22,336
- Can you see her?
- Mummy!

6
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:32,680
Come on!

7
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,724
Hold on!

8
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:53,576
Christ!

9
00:01:55,995 --> 00:01:57,163
Yes!

10
00:02:00,875 --> 00:02:02,251
<i>- Mummy!
- Hi, guys!</i>

11
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:04,795
Oh, Jessie. Yeah!

12
00:02:04,837 --> 00:02:06,839
That was amazing.

13
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:13,762
- Oh, you girls were screaming.
- All right, Jessie?

14
00:02:13,804 --> 00:02:16,765
- That wasn't so bad, was it?
- No, it was a piece of piss.

15
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:20,769
Whoo!

16
00:02:27,026 --> 00:02:28,986
Bitch!

17
00:02:33,491 --> 00:02:36,118
- Bit more, bit more.
- Go on, Paul. Fish her out.

18
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,620
There. Got you.

19
00:02:37,661 --> 00:02:39,622
- You all right?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:41,332 --> 00:02:43,250
It's freezing. I can't feel my fingers.

21
00:02:44,335 --> 00:02:45,586
Heave!

22
00:02:48,047 --> 00:02:49,632
<i>Jessie, Jessie.</i>

23
00:02:49,673 --> 00:02:52,384
Ah, come here. Oh, babe.

24
00:02:57,139 --> 00:03:00,476
<i>It was just amazing.
Would you like to do that?</i>

25
00:03:01,602 --> 00:03:04,313
Come on, Jessie, it's freezing.
Let's go back to the car.

26
00:03:04,355 --> 00:03:05,898
<i>Go with your Daddy.</i>

27
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,025
- I'll just help the girls.
- All right.

28
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,277
It's OK, you go on. We can finish up here.

29
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,780
You sure? Thanks, guys.
I'll see you at the hotel.

30
00:03:12,822 --> 00:03:14,448
See you.

31
00:03:27,002 --> 00:03:29,171
Jess, shall I phone Rachel's mum?

32
00:03:29,213 --> 00:03:32,091
See if Rachel wants
to come to dinner on Thursday?

33
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,135
Yeah? OK.

34
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:38,264
<i>When she comes round,
she can help us plan your birthday party.</i>

35
00:03:38,305 --> 00:03:41,517
Are you going to invite any boys this time?

36
00:03:46,397 --> 00:03:48,357
Are you OK? You seem a bit distant.

37
00:03:49,441 --> 00:03:50,901
I'm fine.

38
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:06,101
Jess?

39
00:05:13,901 --> 00:05:14,944
Jessie!

40
00:05:39,844 --> 00:05:40,886
Jessie!

41
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,641
Sh, sh. I'm sorry. She's gone.

42
00:05:45,683 --> 00:05:48,394
- I'm sorry.
- No!

43
00:05:48,435 --> 00:05:49,770
No, no.

44
00:05:49,812 --> 00:05:52,022
No, no, no.

45
00:05:52,064 --> 00:05:54,608
She's gone, Sarah. Shh.

46
00:05:55,734 --> 00:05:57,820
Shh.

47
00:07:05,596 --> 00:07:08,724
Well, it's mud, blood and beer...

48
00:07:08,766 --> 00:07:11,101
or sweet Jesus.

49
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:13,229
Great. Turn that shite off.

50
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:25,699
That's frightening.

51
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:29,912
Listen, we don't have to do this, you know.

52
00:07:30,913 --> 00:07:33,207
We can head back and stay in town.

53
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,669
Get wasted, go to a barn dance.

54
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:39,713
Now that is frightening.

55
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,181
You're right, we don't have to do this.
But I'm not going to be the one to tell Juno.

56
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:54,436
She's a piece of work, man.
She always brings us out into the middle of...

57
00:07:54,478 --> 00:07:55,980
Well, look at it.

58
00:07:56,021 --> 00:07:59,942
- She came to Scotland last year.
- Yeah, and left pretty quickly.

59
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:39,815
Sarah! Beth!

60
00:08:40,775 --> 00:08:42,485
Juno.

61
00:08:42,526 --> 00:08:44,612
You look fantastic.

62
00:08:46,906 --> 00:08:49,158
Ah, come here. Oh.

63
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,368
Let me look at you. Wow!

64
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,245
Everything is going to be fine.

65
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:54,955
Better. It's going to be great.

66
00:08:54,997 --> 00:08:57,750
Becca and Sam can't wait to see you.
Why don't you go in?

67
00:08:57,792 --> 00:09:00,085
- Give me these.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:01,170
Thanks.

69
00:09:01,212 --> 00:09:03,464
- OK?
- Yeah, OK.

70
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:08,385
<i>Ooh, very nice.</i>

71
00:09:08,427 --> 00:09:11,263
- How is she?
- Well, she's here.

72
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,766
One step at a time, eh?

73
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,478
<i>Hey, hey, hey!
Who are you calling a fucking cheater?</i>

74
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,230
<i>I'm calling you a fucking cheater.</i>

75
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,065
<i>Hello!</i>

76
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,608
<i>Hey!</i>

77
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,985
Hello.

78
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:28,948
- You do look really good.
- Oh, you look amazing.

79
00:09:28,989 --> 00:09:31,242
- Hey!
- Let me put the bags down.

80
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:37,164
Oh, so nice to see you.

81
00:09:37,998 --> 00:09:39,875
- We're starving.
- OK, go, go.

82
00:09:39,917 --> 00:09:42,670
- What have you got?
- Er, well, there's a bit of...

83
00:09:42,711 --> 00:09:44,088
Sam. Sam.

84
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:46,715
Thank you so much for your letter.
It meant a lot to me.

85
00:09:46,757 --> 00:09:49,677
Oh, Sarah, look,
I'm so sorry that I couldn't be there.

86
00:09:49,718 --> 00:09:51,804
You know, mid-terms and...

87
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:56,267
You know, Sam is going to be Doctor Van Ney
in like a year's time.

88
00:09:56,308 --> 00:09:57,351
No!

89
00:09:57,393 --> 00:10:01,564
- Please tell me it's longer than that?
- I am so proud of my little sister.

90
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:04,567
- Who wants a drink?
- Yes! Me!

91
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:07,319
- Brandy shot?
- Yeah, yeah.

92
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:09,196
- So, Beth...
- Mm-hm?

93
00:10:09,238 --> 00:10:12,533
I hear it all starts falling apart past 25?

94
00:10:13,617 --> 00:10:17,037
Is that what they teach you
at medical school, yeah? To take the piss?

95
00:10:17,079 --> 00:10:19,123
- Cheeky bitch!
- Ow!

96
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:21,333
Can anyone make me feel any older?

97
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:23,752
<i>- Oh, here we go.
- Hello.</i>

98
00:10:23,794 --> 00:10:27,590
- Hi, you must be the teacher.
- Beth, Sarah, this is Holly.

99
00:10:27,631 --> 00:10:29,925
Juno's protégé.

100
00:10:29,967 --> 00:10:33,387
- I always thought Juno would eat her young.
- Oh, nice.

101
00:10:33,429 --> 00:10:35,848
I'm well able to handle myself,
thanks very much.

102
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,435
I've heard about you.
You're that mentalist that jumps off buildings.

103
00:10:39,477 --> 00:10:43,314
- Base jumping. You should try it, seriously.
- So you live in America now?

104
00:10:43,355 --> 00:10:45,900
Ran out of things to jump off in Galway,
you know.

105
00:10:45,941 --> 00:10:48,486
I'm always searching for the next big high.

106
00:10:48,569 --> 00:10:50,863
- Sure you'd know all about that.
- Sorry?

107
00:10:50,905 --> 00:10:53,824
Juno showed me a photo
of when you used to climb together.

108
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:57,536
I found this classic picture. Ah!

109
00:10:57,578 --> 00:10:59,789
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

110
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:03,834
- Look at the state of us!
- Oh, my God. That's bad.

111
00:11:03,876 --> 00:11:05,753
<i>Sexy!</i>

112
00:11:07,171 --> 00:11:08,881
Love each day.

113
00:11:10,716 --> 00:11:13,177
Used to be something Paul used to say.

114
00:11:15,554 --> 00:11:17,681
Anyway... cheers.

115
00:11:17,723 --> 00:11:20,601
Here's to our adventure.

116
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,562
- Skol.
- Cheers.

117
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,569
Come on, light, you bastard.

118
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:36,867
So, have you done Boreham Caverns before?

119
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:40,162
I saw it in a book once.
It's for tourists. It's not adventure.

120
00:11:40,204 --> 00:11:43,791
Might as well have hand rails
and a fucking gift shop.

121
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,210
If you're a caver, jumper, climber...

122
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:49,588
<i>...you just do it and not give a shite.</i>

123
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,299
Or the thing that's bigger than you will get you.

124
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:01,433
<i>You want adventure, Holly?
When have I ever let you down?</i>

125
00:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,229
What?

126
00:12:05,271 --> 00:12:08,315
Holly, tomorrow is going to be awesome. OK?

127
00:12:09,984 --> 00:12:12,903
Take this. You need it.

128
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,541
<i>What about Josh, Sam?
Are you guys still together?</i>

129
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:28,210
<i>Kind of. Sort of.</i>

130
00:12:28,252 --> 00:12:30,546
Different... shifts.

131
00:12:31,255 --> 00:12:33,507
Oh, my God.

132
00:12:34,967 --> 00:12:38,053
- Oh, my Jesus!
- What do you think, eh?

133
00:12:40,764 --> 00:12:43,225
Don't say a fucking word, all right?

134
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,019
It was a Christmas present.

135
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:52,693
Shut up.

136
00:12:54,236 --> 00:12:56,697
- What about you Holly? Got a man?
- Oh...

137
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,282
I'm a sports fuck like Juno.

138
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:01,076
- What?
- Rebecca, too, I think.

139
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:07,917
<i>But when I'm older,
I want to have lots of babies.</i>

140
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:12,338
<i>Beth, did Sarah tell you that...</i>

141
00:14:58,736 --> 00:15:00,821
Oh!

142
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:03,657
Wakey.

143
00:15:03,699 --> 00:15:05,075
<i>Wakey.</i>

144
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:08,204
I feel like road kill. Give me five minutes.

145
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:10,122
Five minutes.

146
00:15:27,515 --> 00:15:30,601
Good morning, my little ones.
Wakey, wakey.

147
00:15:31,268 --> 00:15:35,606
- Good morning.
- Is that what you call it? It's fucking freezing!

148
00:15:35,648 --> 00:15:37,108
Holly!

149
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:45,616
We're leaving at seven. Don't be late.

150
00:15:45,658 --> 00:15:47,118
Try that.

151
00:15:48,661 --> 00:15:50,746
The queen is dead.

152
00:15:50,788 --> 00:15:53,874
Long live... the fucking queen.

153
00:16:03,551 --> 00:16:05,219
<i>Beth, you're not driving.</i>

154
00:16:05,261 --> 00:16:08,222
- If you drive we'll never get there.
- Paper, scissors, stone.

155
00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,057
- Come on.
- Oh, you're a dick.

156
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,392
- Go on.
- OK.

157
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,854
- There you go.
- No, wait, babe. Best of three.

158
00:16:14,895 --> 00:16:16,355
I'll drive. Right?

159
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:18,023
Ladies, group photo.

160
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:20,192
You'd better hurry it up. We're running late.

161
00:16:20,234 --> 00:16:23,946
- I look like shit.
- We all look like shit. Just give me a smile.

162
00:16:23,988 --> 00:16:25,739
- Hat? No hat?
- No hat.

163
00:16:25,781 --> 00:16:27,241
<i>- No hat, no hat.
- All right.</i>

164
00:16:27,283 --> 00:16:30,119
- Run, run, run, run.
- Say "sausage"!

165
00:16:30,161 --> 00:16:31,954
Sausage!

166
00:17:00,691 --> 00:17:03,819
- Sarah, slow down a bit.
- I'm having fun.

167
00:17:03,861 --> 00:17:05,488
She's having fun.

168
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:07,281
Whoa! Turn, turn, turn there.

169
00:17:07,323 --> 00:17:09,200
- Let's off road.
- Great.

170
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:14,455
You should have some water.

171
00:17:14,497 --> 00:17:18,626
Trying to set this watch is impossible.
The buttons are too fucking small.

172
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,753
- Leave it alone.
- Why do you wear it, anyway?

173
00:17:20,795 --> 00:17:24,215
- My boyfriend gave it to me, it's sentimental.
- It's fucking mental.

174
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:26,550
Any guy that gave that to me, I'd dump him.

175
00:17:29,345 --> 00:17:31,472
<i>Juno, are you sure this is the right way?</i>

176
00:17:31,514 --> 00:17:34,892
- Relax, I've never been lost in my life.
- Marvellous.

177
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:49,824
- So have you done these caves before?
- No.

178
00:17:49,865 --> 00:17:52,535
But they are only level two.
Quite safe, don't worry.

179
00:17:52,576 --> 00:17:56,038
- I wasn't.
- The only danger is that I might fall asleep.

180
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,958
Boreham Caves.
More like boredom caves.

181
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:28,988
- Nice parking.
- Thanks.

182
00:18:38,873 --> 00:18:42,376
<i>This one time in Galway.
When I free-climbed the cathedral,</i>

183
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:45,588
<i>a priest chased me
down the whole of the ground floor.</i>

184
00:18:45,629 --> 00:18:47,965
<i>That was brilliant.</i>

185
00:18:48,007 --> 00:18:51,552
<i>- I shouldn't have wasted the effort, though.
Holly, shut up.</i>

186
00:18:51,594 --> 00:18:53,721
Rebecca, leave her alone.

187
00:18:53,762 --> 00:18:56,599
OK, guys, let's get moving. We're running late.

188
00:19:04,982 --> 00:19:07,485
Come on, keep up.

189
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:12,156
Hey, Holly, wait up.
Move it, short arse.

190
00:19:15,743 --> 00:19:19,455
Oi, Carter, get to the back.
Come on, you lazy bastard.

191
00:19:26,587 --> 00:19:28,672
You finally caught up with me.

192
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:37,056
- Juno, are we there yet?
- There's a river about half a mile ahead.

193
00:19:37,097 --> 00:19:40,267
When we reach it,
we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?

194
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:43,270
How does she know there's a river up ahead?
I can't hear a thing.

195
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:44,814
She can probably smell it.

196
00:19:44,855 --> 00:19:47,441
She came up here last week
to check the route out.

197
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:50,903
<i>It's rule number one -
file a flight plan and stick to it.</i>

198
00:19:50,945 --> 00:19:53,697
- And rule number two?
- Don't go wandering off.

199
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:58,494
You think it's dark when you turn out the lights.
Well, down there it's pitch black.

200
00:19:59,703 --> 00:20:03,290
- You can get dehydration, disorientation...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

201
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,251
<i>- ...claustrophobia...
- Blah, blah.</i>

202
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:09,338
<i>...panic attacks, paranoia, hallucinations,</i>

203
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:12,049
visual and aural deterioration...

204
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:32,820
Hey!

205
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:35,990
Eurgh.

206
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:40,578
Yeah, lovely, Holly. A real Kodak moment.

207
00:20:40,619 --> 00:20:43,539
- Don't touch it.
- You wouldn't want to piss it off.

208
00:20:43,581 --> 00:20:46,167
What do you think did that, Sam? A bear?

209
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,377
What is this? Nature Detectives?

210
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,965
- It could have been Big Foot. Come on.
- Sam, stop poking it with a fucking stick.

211
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:15,905
This is it.

212
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:22,244
- You're having a laugh!
- Afraid not.

213
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:26,832
I'm an English teacher,
not fucking Tomb Raider.

214
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,919
You'll be fine.

215
00:21:36,801 --> 00:21:40,137
<i>OK, Sarah, Beth, you're up next.
Sam, stay with Becca.</i>

216
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:41,972
<i>Do what she does and you'll be fine.</i>

217
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:45,476
Holly, safety first.
I don't want any stunts this time.

218
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,020
- You OK? See you down there.
- No.

219
00:21:48,062 --> 00:21:52,441
<i>Make sure your cow's tail is locked
there and there. You hold on to this like that.</i>

220
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,568
Look, I have done this before, you know?

221
00:21:54,610 --> 00:21:59,031
- I'm only looking after you.
- And I appreciate it, in small doses.

222
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:24,682
<i>You gotta see this place.</i>

223
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:27,059
It's beautiful!

224
00:22:27,101 --> 00:22:30,729
<i>You won't believe this, Beth.
- Oh, shit!</i>

225
00:22:30,771 --> 00:22:32,440
Shit, shit, shit.

226
00:22:37,486 --> 00:22:39,822
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die.

227
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,165
Ah, piece of piss.

228
00:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,419
Oh, my God!

229
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:54,920
<i>It's incredible.</i>

230
00:22:54,962 --> 00:22:56,464
<i> Clear!</i>

231
00:23:03,554 --> 00:23:05,973
It's Holly.

232
00:23:06,015 --> 00:23:07,308
Shit, move!

233
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:13,439
Holly, you do this safely,
in order, following my lead. OK?

234
00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:15,191
Take it slow and easy.

235
00:23:24,533 --> 00:23:27,161
<i>Juno.
- Smart arse.</i>

236
00:23:59,110 --> 00:24:00,528
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

237
00:24:00,569 --> 00:24:03,322
They're gone. They're gone now. Look.

238
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:09,245
<i> One bat, two bats.</i>

239
00:24:09,286 --> 00:24:10,704
50 bats.

240
00:24:12,414 --> 00:24:14,542
Holly, fuck off.

241
00:24:18,629 --> 00:24:20,381
Which way?

242
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:23,717
There's only one way out of this chamber
and that's down the pipe.

243
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:35,479
OK.

244
00:25:20,983 --> 00:25:22,443
It's a drop.

245
00:25:27,948 --> 00:25:29,200
OK?

246
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:34,955
Holly, chuck us your bag.

247
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,933
Oh, my God!

248
00:27:17,308 --> 00:27:19,560
<i> Find anything good?</i>

249
00:27:19,602 --> 00:27:22,688
- Jesus Christ!
- Come on, let's eat.

250
00:27:28,194 --> 00:27:32,198
- Holly, would you take a break?
- I just want to take a few more shots.

251
00:27:32,239 --> 00:27:34,992
This cave is a lot cooler than I thought.

252
00:27:39,455 --> 00:27:40,498
Hey?

253
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,541
Not hungry.

254
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,835
Are you OK?

255
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,380
Juno, I won't break. I'm fine.

256
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,675
- I asked you for this.
- I know.

257
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:56,889
Um, Sarah?

258
00:27:57,640 --> 00:28:00,726
<i>I haven't had a chance to say that I'm...</i>

259
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:03,979
really sorry I didn't stay around longer
after the accident.

260
00:28:09,944 --> 00:28:11,821
Anyway...

261
00:28:13,239 --> 00:28:15,116
<i>...we're all here for you now, OK?</i>

262
00:28:15,908 --> 00:28:17,535
Yeah.

263
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,621
Look, sorry. I'm feeling a bit out of it.
It's probably jet lag.

264
00:28:20,663 --> 00:28:23,916
- So I'm just going to take a look around, OK?
- Yeah, OK.

265
00:28:23,958 --> 00:28:26,544
Why don't you try and find us
the way through, huh?

266
00:28:26,585 --> 00:28:28,838
Hey, don't go too far.

267
00:28:36,137 --> 00:28:39,140
What's up with her?
She looks like she's seen a ghost.

268
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,599
She's fine.

269
00:28:59,201 --> 00:29:01,287
I've found the next passage!

270
00:29:10,004 --> 00:29:13,257
- That's it? It's a bit small, isn't it?
- Hey, hey, hey!

271
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:16,218
- I don't get this.
- What?

272
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,971
This is not how I imagined it
from reading the book.

273
00:29:19,013 --> 00:29:22,558
That's why I don't trust books.
Leaves too much room for interpretation.

274
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,143
Something wrong?

275
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:25,436
- No.
- It's nothing.

276
00:29:26,812 --> 00:29:28,355
<i>I'm taking point, guys.</i>

277
00:29:29,815 --> 00:29:33,152
Careful. Just find the way through.
We'll wait here.

278
00:32:27,993 --> 00:32:29,036
Sarah?

279
00:32:30,162 --> 00:32:32,331
<i>- Shit.
- Are you still behind me?</i>

280
00:32:32,373 --> 00:32:33,791
Yes.

281
00:32:35,668 --> 00:32:36,710
Shit!

282
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:39,213
Shit!

283
00:32:39,255 --> 00:32:42,967
Sarah?
Guys, it's Sarah, I think she might be stuck.

284
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,760
<i>I am stuck!</i>

285
00:32:45,511 --> 00:32:47,763
<i>All right, Sarah.
Calm down, just relax.</i>

286
00:32:49,682 --> 00:32:52,101
I can't fucking relax.

287
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:53,477
Fuck, fuck!

288
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:57,773
Sarah, you have to calm down and the only way
you're going to do that is to breathe.

289
00:32:57,815 --> 00:33:01,485
<i>OK, breathe slowly. Just keep breathing.</i>

290
00:33:04,321 --> 00:33:07,074
I can't. I can't.

291
00:33:07,116 --> 00:33:11,287
<i>- I can't fucking breathe.
- Sarah, OK, listen to me.</i>

292
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:13,247
Just listen to my voice, yeah?

293
00:33:14,331 --> 00:33:18,043
Sarah, I'm coming. I'm coming back.
OK? OK.

294
00:33:18,878 --> 00:33:21,046
Sarah, OK?

295
00:33:21,088 --> 00:33:24,884
Listen to me, keep breathing. OK? Hey.

296
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:28,721
Hey, hey.

297
00:33:28,762 --> 00:33:32,308
OK. OK. OK.

298
00:33:32,349 --> 00:33:36,562
<i>- Look here at me, Sarah, hey?
- Help me.</i>

299
00:33:36,604 --> 00:33:39,940
What are you so worried about, Sarah?
Look at me.

300
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:42,067
OK, breathe. Breathe, OK?

301
00:33:42,109 --> 00:33:44,487
Hey, hey, hey. Listen to me.

302
00:33:44,528 --> 00:33:48,824
- Listen to me. What are you so afraid of?
- I can't fucking move!

303
00:33:48,866 --> 00:33:52,077
<i>You can move. Sarah, look at me, look at me.</i>

304
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,750
The worst thing that could have happened to
you has already happened and you're still here.

305
00:33:57,792 --> 00:34:01,921
This is just a poxy cave and there's nothing left
to be afraid of, I promise.

306
00:34:01,962 --> 00:34:03,798
OK? OK?

307
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,925
Hey. Hey, listen, listen.

308
00:34:05,966 --> 00:34:09,887
Listen to me, you'll love this one.
How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

309
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:13,891
God damn it, let me hear you say it.
How do you give a lemon an orgasm?

310
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:16,393
What do you do? You tickle its citrus.

311
00:34:16,435 --> 00:34:18,187
OK, that's better. Come on.

312
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:22,066
OK, OK. All right, we're going to move now.
Take hold of my arm, all right?

313
00:34:22,108 --> 00:34:24,860
We're going to move slowly.
That's it, grab my arm, OK?

314
00:34:24,902 --> 00:34:26,153
OK, come on.

315
00:34:26,195 --> 00:34:28,864
Just slowly. Pull on me, OK?
OK, come on.

316
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:34,662
The rope bag. I forgot the rope bag.

317
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:35,579
OK.

318
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:45,798
OK, fuck the rope bag. OK, move, now!

319
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,924
Now!

320
00:34:46,966 --> 00:34:48,050
Hurry up!

321
00:34:49,135 --> 00:34:51,011
Sarah, come on!

322
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,806
Sarah, keep hold of the rope!

323
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:16,412
Sarah?

324
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:17,580
Oh, ah.

325
00:35:17,621 --> 00:35:19,540
- Are you OK?
- I'm all right.

326
00:35:19,582 --> 00:35:22,460
Is everybody OK? Is everybody OK?

327
00:35:22,501 --> 00:35:24,462
- Don't fucking touch me.
Rebecca?

328
00:35:24,503 --> 00:35:26,881
I'm here, I'm OK.
Beth, are you injured?

329
00:35:26,922 --> 00:35:28,174
No, I'm fine.

330
00:35:28,215 --> 00:35:32,720
- Nobody move until the dust has settled.
- Don't worry, Juno, we're not going anywhere.

331
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:38,100
<i>You might be right about that.</i>

332
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:39,894
Jesus.

333
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,273
So what's the story now?

334
00:35:45,107 --> 00:35:48,778
According to the guidebook,
this cave system has three ways out.

335
00:35:48,819 --> 00:35:52,198
This is just one of them.
Isn't that right, Juno?

336
00:35:52,948 --> 00:35:54,700
<i>Juno, that's right, isn't it?</i>

337
00:35:55,618 --> 00:35:57,077
Check the book.

338
00:35:58,954 --> 00:36:01,040
- I didn't bring it.
- What?

339
00:36:02,333 --> 00:36:03,834
No point.

340
00:36:04,919 --> 00:36:07,046
For Christ's sake, Juno.

341
00:36:07,087 --> 00:36:09,590
<i>I knew it. I knew this wasn't right.</i>

342
00:36:09,632 --> 00:36:14,094
You filed a flight plan to mountain rescue?
If we don't report in, they'll come looking for us.

343
00:36:14,136 --> 00:36:18,974
That's how it's supposed to work
except I put in a flight plan for Boreham Caverns

344
00:36:19,016 --> 00:36:21,894
and this isn't Boreham Caverns, is it, Juno?

345
00:36:21,936 --> 00:36:23,813
We're in the wrong fucking cave?

346
00:36:23,854 --> 00:36:26,732
Holly was right.
Boreham Caverns was a tourist trap.

347
00:36:26,774 --> 00:36:32,655
- Don't try and pin this fucking shite on me!
- This is not caving. This is an ego trip.

348
00:36:32,696 --> 00:36:35,491
Rebecca,
I didn't know this was going to happen.

349
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:37,284
This is exactly what we believe in.

350
00:36:37,326 --> 00:36:39,745
We said, if there's no risk, what's the point?

351
00:36:39,787 --> 00:36:42,123
Don't try and justify this.

352
00:36:42,164 --> 00:36:44,041
Where... Where are we?

353
00:36:44,750 --> 00:36:47,586
It hasn't got a name. It's a new system.

354
00:36:47,628 --> 00:36:50,256
I wanted us all to discover it.

355
00:36:50,297 --> 00:36:53,050
No-one's ever been down here before.

356
00:36:53,092 --> 00:36:55,761
- You're fucking kidding me.
- Oh, God!

357
00:36:57,346 --> 00:37:00,724
<i>How the hell do we get out?
There may not be a way out.</i>

358
00:37:00,766 --> 00:37:03,394
<i>Look, there's no going back now.</i>

359
00:37:03,436 --> 00:37:06,605
We have to find a way out of this chamber
and keep pushing forward.

360
00:37:06,647 --> 00:37:08,983
<i>What the fuck do you think you're doing?</i>

361
00:37:09,024 --> 00:37:12,486
<i>We all trusted you. You told me
this was going to be good for Sarah.</i>

362
00:37:13,404 --> 00:37:16,031
<i>Have you any idea what she's been through?</i>

363
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:18,909
<i>No, cos you couldn't get away fast enough,
you selfish cow.</i>

364
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:20,953
<i>You know what, Beth?</i>

365
00:37:20,995 --> 00:37:24,457
We all lost something in that crash.

366
00:37:28,836 --> 00:37:30,921
Just get us out of here.

367
00:37:33,424 --> 00:37:38,554
<i>Look, cave systems
sometimes break ground. It's a small chance.</i>

368
00:37:38,596 --> 00:37:40,765
But if we stay here, we'll die.

369
00:37:40,806 --> 00:37:42,808
<i>Let's go.</i>

370
00:38:14,924 --> 00:38:16,300
<i>Wait!
- What?</i>

371
00:38:16,342 --> 00:38:18,636
Don't move, Sam. Just don't move.

372
00:38:18,677 --> 00:38:20,554
Stay right there.

373
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,792
Oh, shit. No more.

374
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,764
Thanks, Beth.

375
00:39:03,848 --> 00:39:06,434
Now I know how far down it is.

376
00:39:06,475 --> 00:39:08,269
So, what now?

377
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:12,815
One of us has to get all the way across there
so they can rig a line for you guys.

378
00:39:14,608 --> 00:39:19,071
I have three cams, I need at least three more.
Where's the other rope bag?

379
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:21,657
Where is it?

380
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,785
We lost it, when the cave collapsed.

381
00:39:26,036 --> 00:39:27,079
Sorry.

382
00:39:45,181 --> 00:39:46,640
Help me.

383
00:40:13,834 --> 00:40:15,419
<i>Come on, Becca.</i>

384
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:39,235
- Aargh!
- You got it.

385
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:50,412
Come on, come on.

386
00:40:51,247 --> 00:40:53,666
<i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

387
00:40:53,707 --> 00:40:55,835
<i>Come on, Rebecca.</i>

388
00:40:55,876 --> 00:40:57,962
<i>What are you waiting for?</i>

389
00:41:00,631 --> 00:41:02,007
<i>- Fuck.
- Are you OK?</i>

390
00:41:02,049 --> 00:41:03,884
What's wrong?

391
00:41:03,926 --> 00:41:06,679
It's nothing. I'm all right.

392
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,972
OK.

393
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,569
All right, more slack.

394
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:24,447
More slack, thanks.

395
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:31,245
Fuck!

396
00:41:39,545 --> 00:41:41,797
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

397
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:46,051
<i>- OK.
Well done.</i>

398
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:51,599
OK.
Throw me the right rope.

399
00:41:55,269 --> 00:41:56,312
OK.

400
00:41:58,272 --> 00:41:59,315
OK.

401
00:42:06,071 --> 00:42:07,281
Come on.

402
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,961
Yeah!

403
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:25,382
- Now, you make it look easy.
- Yeah, well, you make it look hard.

404
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:34,266
<i>- Oh.
Don't look down, Beth. Keep going.</i>

405
00:42:34,308 --> 00:42:37,269
- Just keep going.
You're OK. You're safe.

406
00:42:41,065 --> 00:42:43,818
Good. There you go.

407
00:42:50,825 --> 00:42:52,910
Was this about me or you?

408
00:42:55,704 --> 00:42:59,125
It's about us,
getting back to what we used to be.

409
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:02,419
I wanted us to claim this place, name it.

410
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:05,673
I thought maybe your name.

411
00:43:05,714 --> 00:43:07,174
Or maybe yours.

412
00:43:13,472 --> 00:43:15,558
You're doing well. Come on.

413
00:43:16,308 --> 00:43:17,768
Come on.

414
00:43:20,146 --> 00:43:22,773
There you are. Come on, give me your hand.

415
00:43:38,038 --> 00:43:39,081
Juno?

416
00:43:40,166 --> 00:43:42,543
We'll need everything we've got.

417
00:43:43,961 --> 00:43:45,963
<i>Haul it in.</i>

418
00:44:06,984 --> 00:44:08,027
Fuck.

419
00:44:27,296 --> 00:44:28,339
Yes!

420
00:44:32,301 --> 00:44:33,719
Reach.

421
00:44:33,761 --> 00:44:35,387
<i>Reach out.</i>

422
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:37,223
Aargh!

423
00:44:38,099 --> 00:44:39,683
Juno!

424
00:44:39,725 --> 00:44:40,768
No!

425
00:44:57,076 --> 00:44:59,411
<i>Juno, it's OK, we've got you.</i>

426
00:44:59,453 --> 00:45:00,871
<i>OK, pull!</i>

427
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,794
Sam!
Holly, let me pass.

428
00:45:07,837 --> 00:45:09,547
<i>Rebecca, show me your hand.</i>

429
00:45:24,812 --> 00:45:26,397
Let go, let go.

430
00:45:26,439 --> 00:45:29,358
- What does it mean?
- It means we're not the first.

431
00:45:30,109 --> 00:45:32,153
It's a piton, right?

432
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:35,406
If cavers were here,
there's a better chance of us getting out.

433
00:45:35,448 --> 00:45:39,702
This equipment is at least 100 years old.
No-one uses stuff like this any more.

434
00:45:39,743 --> 00:45:42,746
Besides, if anyone had been down here
and made it out,

435
00:45:42,788 --> 00:45:44,498
they would have named it already.

436
00:45:45,624 --> 00:45:48,169
<i>Becca, are you OK?</i>

437
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:49,336
I'll live.

438
00:45:53,841 --> 00:45:56,218
Holly, how does it look?

439
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,345
<i>It's tight again, but I can get through.</i>

440
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:00,890
OK, keep going. We'll be right behind you.

441
00:46:14,028 --> 00:46:16,113
Hey, there's something down here.

442
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:51,857
Guys, it's amazing,
but the batteries on our lights will run out.

443
00:46:51,899 --> 00:46:55,319
<i>- So I suggest we keep moving.
- Wait a minute. Wait.</i>

444
00:46:55,361 --> 00:46:58,864
- What is it, Beth?
- Juno, light up one of your flares.

445
00:46:58,906 --> 00:47:02,368
- We don't have time for this.
- Just light a flare.

446
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:18,050
- Really lovely, Beth, but it's fucking useless.
- No, look at it. What do you see?

447
00:47:18,092 --> 00:47:20,177
<i>You've got the mountain, the cave...</i>

448
00:47:20,219 --> 00:47:22,763
and there's two entrances.

449
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:29,645
- You are a fucking genius.
- I have my moments.

450
00:47:29,687 --> 00:47:32,565
- This means there's another way out?
- Let's find out.

451
00:47:33,774 --> 00:47:35,109
Come on!

452
00:47:54,170 --> 00:47:56,255
- Bastard!
- Which way?

453
00:47:56,297 --> 00:47:58,382
Holly, give me your lighter.

454
00:48:00,259 --> 00:48:01,969
- Come on.
- Here.

455
00:48:06,724 --> 00:48:07,892
Fuck!

456
00:48:08,976 --> 00:48:11,937
- Come on! Come on!
- Shit!

457
00:48:15,232 --> 00:48:18,110
- That one!
- Hey! Holly!

458
00:48:20,154 --> 00:48:22,323
Holly, slow down!

459
00:48:25,075 --> 00:48:28,621
<i>Holly! Careful!</i>

460
00:48:29,705 --> 00:48:31,874
Daylight! I can see daylight!

461
00:48:34,877 --> 00:48:37,838
<i>Holly! Careful! Slow down!</i>

462
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:40,716
<i>Holly, it's not daylight!</i>

463
00:48:47,181 --> 00:48:48,432
- Help me!
- Hold on!

464
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:51,852
Guys! Hold...

465
00:48:52,561 --> 00:48:54,480
Holly!

466
00:49:01,028 --> 00:49:03,239
Sam! Get down here!

467
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:04,532
Holly!

468
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:07,827
<i>Holly!</i>

469
00:49:21,507 --> 00:49:23,801
<i>Holly! Answer me!</i>

470
00:49:31,392 --> 00:49:32,852
I think I hurt my leg!

471
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:36,105
<i>Don't move! We're coming down to you.</i>

472
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:40,109
Oh, fuck!

473
00:49:44,697 --> 00:49:47,700
No! Fuck!

474
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:57,918
Someone better get down here!

475
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,806
- Oh, that's fucking disgusting.
- Beth! Not here, not now!

476
00:50:10,848 --> 00:50:14,435
We need help. Everybody grab a corner.
We need to move her out of the water.

477
00:50:15,686 --> 00:50:19,023
Nice and easy now. And... lift!

478
00:50:19,064 --> 00:50:20,149
Argh!

479
00:50:22,318 --> 00:50:25,488
- You fuckers!
- Juno, find something to make a splint out of.

480
00:50:25,529 --> 00:50:28,532
- It's OK, I've got her.
- Hey, Juno, use one of the ice axes.

481
00:50:28,574 --> 00:50:30,367
You'll be all right, sweetheart.

482
00:50:43,464 --> 00:50:45,549
OK.

483
00:50:47,093 --> 00:50:49,720
- Sarah!
- Juno, I'm gonna need your help here.

484
00:50:49,762 --> 00:50:51,472
- Sarah!
- Juno!

485
00:50:52,306 --> 00:50:54,809
Take hold of her arm.
You'll have to hold her down.

486
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:56,310
What are you gonna do?

487
00:50:56,352 --> 00:51:00,356
I need to dress the wound and rig up a splint,
but I can't while the bone is protruding.

488
00:51:00,397 --> 00:51:02,358
I need to push it back in.

489
00:51:03,442 --> 00:51:06,153
- I hate you.
- I know.

490
00:51:06,195 --> 00:51:07,238
Do it.

491
00:51:22,336 --> 00:51:24,630
Bite down on this.

492
00:51:24,672 --> 00:51:27,466
- Keep hold of her.
- Just fucking bite down, OK?

493
00:51:27,508 --> 00:51:29,593
Go!

494
00:51:33,139 --> 00:51:34,765
<i>Come on!</i>

495
00:51:42,189 --> 00:51:44,358
Just keep biting down, baby.

496
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,527
Come on.

497
00:51:48,362 --> 00:51:51,073
OK, someone get me a medical kit.

498
00:51:52,908 --> 00:51:56,162
OK, OK, OK. Calm down. It'll be all right.

499
00:52:32,448 --> 00:52:34,533
What are you doing?

500
00:52:34,575 --> 00:52:36,952
I just saw something ahead in the tunnel.

501
00:52:39,914 --> 00:52:42,917
Sarah, I promise you,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

502
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:45,127
But I can't do it unless you're with me.

503
00:52:45,169 --> 00:52:47,254
<i>Sarah?</i>

504
00:52:48,297 --> 00:52:50,257
Sarah!

505
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:53,385
Sarah, look at me.

506
00:52:54,178 --> 00:52:56,263
There's nothing there.

507
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,103
That's the best I can do.

508
00:53:02,144 --> 00:53:06,023
It'll hurt like hell and you can't put any weight
on it, but at least you can move.

509
00:53:06,065 --> 00:53:10,027
They combed these mountains centuries ago.
Anyone trapped would be a skeleton now.

510
00:53:10,069 --> 00:53:12,029
- That is just what it looked like.
- What?

511
00:53:12,071 --> 00:53:14,198
- Sarah thinks she saw someone.
- Saw what?

512
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,784
<i>I don't think I saw someone, I saw someone.</i>

513
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:19,578
No, you heard something
and saw what you wanted to see.

514
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:23,332
- It's the dark. It plays tricks on people.
- I can describe exactly what I saw.

515
00:53:23,374 --> 00:53:26,460
- What did you see?
- A man. I saw a man.

516
00:53:26,502 --> 00:53:28,587
<i>Are you sure?
- Yes!</i>

517
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:32,299
And it's not the first time. I thought
I saw someone before, but now I'm sure.

518
00:53:32,341 --> 00:53:36,137
Look, if there is somebody down here,
then maybe they can help get us out.

519
00:53:36,178 --> 00:53:38,848
Sarah, there's no-one down here.
Forget about it!

520
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:41,183
Hey, we have to get Holly out of here.

521
00:53:41,225 --> 00:53:43,436
OK? This is all that matters right now.

522
00:53:44,603 --> 00:53:47,273
- Beth!
- It's OK.

523
00:53:47,314 --> 00:53:49,400
Is it? Fuck!

524
00:53:51,193 --> 00:53:52,528
Fuck me.

525
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:54,655
<i>You've got to keep warm.</i>

526
00:53:55,948 --> 00:53:58,909
Why are we walking away?
There was daylight back there.

527
00:53:58,951 --> 00:54:01,245
It wasn't. It was phosphorus in the rock.

528
00:54:01,287 --> 00:54:04,415
We're two miles underground,
the only light down here is ours.

529
00:54:04,457 --> 00:54:07,585
Argh! Well, it looked like fucking daylight to me.

530
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:23,642
Right tunnel!

531
00:54:40,868 --> 00:54:43,412
I got you. OK?

532
00:55:53,065 --> 00:55:56,193
Jesus! What is this place?

533
00:55:56,235 --> 00:55:59,321
Holly, where's the infrared button?

534
00:56:07,496 --> 00:56:08,914
<i>Dead animals.</i>

535
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:11,292
<i>Hundreds of them.</i>

536
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,877
This is not good, guys.

537
00:56:12,918 --> 00:56:15,004
Can we get out of here? Which way?

538
00:56:15,045 --> 00:56:17,131
Come on.

539
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:22,094
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you don't know?

540
00:56:22,136 --> 00:56:26,265
There's no breeze. It could be
any one of these tunnels. Take your pick.

541
00:56:26,307 --> 00:56:28,851
Oh, fuck it! Hello!

542
00:56:28,893 --> 00:56:32,938
- Please!
- Is there anybody there?

543
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,065
Hello!

544
00:56:41,155 --> 00:56:44,325
It's there! It's up there!
It's there on the roof!

545
00:56:51,665 --> 00:56:55,211
Fucking hell, did you see...?
What the fuck was that?

546
00:56:55,252 --> 00:56:57,880
I don't know!
It moved so fast, I could barely see it!

547
00:56:57,922 --> 00:57:01,217
- I've never seen anyone climb like that!
- I told you I saw someone!

548
00:57:01,258 --> 00:57:03,469
- That was not a human being!
- Screw this.

549
00:57:03,511 --> 00:57:06,138
Let's take our chances and pick a tunnel. Move!

550
00:57:16,607 --> 00:57:18,692
What's happening?

551
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:21,403
Oh, shit! It's circling us.

552
00:57:29,703 --> 00:57:33,457
- Where is it?
- This way! Move!

553
00:57:33,499 --> 00:57:38,421
- Holly! We've got to move. We've got to move.
- Come on! Move it!

554
00:57:38,462 --> 00:57:41,841
<i>Come on, Holly! Move it! Let's go!</i>

555
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:45,970
- Juno, the flare! Get rid of it!
- Fuck!

556
00:57:46,971 --> 00:57:50,558
Holly, keep moving, come on!

557
00:58:05,698 --> 00:58:07,700
Holly! Holly!

558
00:58:08,576 --> 00:58:10,035
Sarah!

559
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,831
Holly!

560
00:58:25,843 --> 00:58:27,720
Sarah!

561
00:58:29,221 --> 00:58:31,682
<i>Sarah! Run!</i>

562
00:58:34,977 --> 00:58:36,896
Sarah!

563
00:58:48,991 --> 00:58:50,743
Get off!

564
00:58:50,785 --> 00:58:52,703
Get away, you fucker!

565
01:00:25,963 --> 01:00:27,882
<i>Don't leave me.</i>

566
01:00:51,822 --> 01:00:54,742
Oh, fuck. My battery's gone dead.

567
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:57,745
Where are they?

568
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:02,875
What's happened to the others?

569
01:01:02,917 --> 01:01:05,920
Becca, please say we're gonna get out of here.

570
01:01:07,213 --> 01:01:09,298
OK. OK.

571
01:01:09,340 --> 01:01:11,425
OK.

572
01:01:15,888 --> 01:01:17,973
Go. Go!

573
01:01:34,281 --> 01:01:37,076
<i>Mummy. Mummy.</i>

574
01:01:37,118 --> 01:01:38,786
<i>If you're really ready...</i>

575
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,126
Oh, fuck. Fuck.

576
01:04:24,952 --> 01:04:27,037
Turn the light off.

577
01:04:32,835 --> 01:04:34,920
Quiet.

578
01:05:08,162 --> 01:05:09,997
<i>Sarah! Sarah!</i>

579
01:05:11,999 --> 01:05:13,250
Sarah!

580
01:06:28,784 --> 01:06:30,870
It can't see us.

581
01:06:54,351 --> 01:06:56,395
Sam? Becca?

582
01:06:58,189 --> 01:07:00,816
Becca!

583
01:07:01,692 --> 01:07:03,152
<i>- Becca!
- It's Juno.</i>

584
01:07:03,194 --> 01:07:04,445
<i>Becca!</i>

585
01:07:04,528 --> 01:07:08,324
The noise she's making, she'll bring
every one of those things down on her head.

586
01:07:08,365 --> 01:07:10,826
As long as it's not on mine.

587
01:07:17,124 --> 01:07:19,210
Becca!

588
01:07:22,797 --> 01:07:24,882
<i>Sam!</i>

589
01:08:18,352 --> 01:08:20,438
<i>Sam!</i>

590
01:08:22,773 --> 01:08:24,859
<i>Sam!</i>

591
01:08:26,444 --> 01:08:28,529
Anyone?

592
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,072
Sam!

593
01:08:52,595 --> 01:08:54,764
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

594
01:08:56,307 --> 01:08:57,641
Oh...

595
01:08:57,683 --> 01:08:59,602
I'm sorry.

596
01:10:23,269 --> 01:10:25,354
Fuck. OK.

597
01:10:28,524 --> 01:10:29,859
OK.

598
01:10:34,655 --> 01:10:36,031
OK.

599
01:10:36,073 --> 01:10:38,159
It's all clear.

600
01:11:10,149 --> 01:11:11,650
Sam, run!

601
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,988
We heard you crying for Sarah.

602
01:12:01,575 --> 01:12:03,202
Where are the others?

603
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:07,498
They... They took Holly.

604
01:12:09,125 --> 01:12:11,210
Beth...

605
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:15,339
Beth's dead.

606
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,731
Sam...

607
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:35,943
<i>...what is that thing?</i>

608
01:12:40,948 --> 01:12:43,951
I don't know. Well, it does look human.

609
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:48,414
Come on, we need to find the way out
before those things find us.

610
01:12:48,456 --> 01:12:49,999
No.

611
01:12:50,165 --> 01:12:53,544
Sam, tell us what we're fighting.

612
01:12:54,378 --> 01:12:56,088
Well...

613
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:59,341
<i>...they're totally blind.</i>

614
01:12:59,383 --> 01:13:04,680
And judging from what we've seen,
I'd say they use sound to hunt with. Like a bat.

615
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:10,269
And they've evolved perfectly
to live down here in the dark.

616
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:17,776
Whatever they are,
they go to the surface to hunt.

617
01:13:17,818 --> 01:13:21,780
And they bring their food back down here to eat,
through an entrance.

618
01:13:22,990 --> 01:13:27,828
Listen, if we can stay quiet enough
and evade these fuckers...

619
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,956
<i>...I think I found the way out.</i>

620
01:13:30,998 --> 01:13:32,666
You think?

621
01:13:32,708 --> 01:13:38,422
The climbing gear we found - whoever
brought that down here marked their route.

622
01:13:39,548 --> 01:13:42,593
- I found those markings.
- Well, what are we waiting for?

623
01:13:42,635 --> 01:13:44,678
Sarah.

624
01:13:46,972 --> 01:13:49,058
I'm not leaving without Sarah.

625
01:14:11,288 --> 01:14:13,374
Sarah!

626
01:14:14,959 --> 01:14:17,044
Oh, God.

627
01:14:17,920 --> 01:14:19,672
Oh, God.

628
01:14:21,048 --> 01:14:23,133
Oh, God. No.

629
01:14:24,009 --> 01:14:25,261
Sarah...

630
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,639
I'm getting you out of here.

631
01:14:31,267 --> 01:14:33,644
Don't touch me. Don't touch me.

632
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,732
I heard Juno calling me.

633
01:14:37,774 --> 01:14:41,027
I'm gonna go and find her,
and we're gonna come back and get you out.

634
01:14:41,069 --> 01:14:43,154
No, stay away from her.

635
01:14:43,196 --> 01:14:46,199
- What?
- She did this to me.

636
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:49,160
<i>- What?
- She left me.</i>

637
01:14:49,202 --> 01:14:50,828
No, she didn't. No.

638
01:14:50,870 --> 01:14:52,956
- Shh.
- Sarah...

639
01:14:54,707 --> 01:14:56,793
Don't trust her.

640
01:14:57,794 --> 01:15:00,046
You find your own way out.

641
01:15:00,088 --> 01:15:02,173
It's OK. It's all right.

642
01:15:02,215 --> 01:15:05,760
I'm not gonna leave you, Beth.
I'm not gonna leave you.

643
01:15:05,802 --> 01:15:07,887
I'm not leaving you here, OK?

644
01:15:07,929 --> 01:15:10,223
Come here. Beth!

645
01:15:17,355 --> 01:15:19,440
This is Juno's.

646
01:15:23,027 --> 01:15:25,113
It's from Paul.

647
01:15:26,906 --> 01:15:28,992
Oh, no.

648
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:41,087
Sorry.

649
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:54,976
Please... Oh, that's them. Please, come with me.

650
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:56,728
Please.

651
01:15:56,769 --> 01:15:58,354
Sarah...

652
01:15:59,439 --> 01:16:02,567
<i>...don't leave me like this.</i>

653
01:16:04,611 --> 01:16:07,780
No, please don't ask me to do that.

654
01:16:07,822 --> 01:16:10,450
- Please.
- I can't. I can't do that.

655
01:16:10,491 --> 01:16:12,201
I can't do that.

656
01:16:12,243 --> 01:16:14,329
Please.

657
01:16:26,382 --> 01:16:28,843
OK. Ssh.

658
01:16:28,885 --> 01:16:30,511
Close your eyes.

659
01:20:20,116 --> 01:20:22,201
Hurry! Move!

660
01:20:26,539 --> 01:20:28,625
Sarah?

661
01:20:29,792 --> 01:20:31,878
Sarah?

662
01:20:33,087 --> 01:20:34,547
Sarah?

663
01:20:34,589 --> 01:20:38,509
Look, she's dead, Juno. We can't wait for her.

664
01:20:38,593 --> 01:20:39,928
Come on!

665
01:20:41,220 --> 01:20:43,932
<i>Sarah!</i>

666
01:20:44,974 --> 01:20:46,851
<i>Sarah!</i>

667
01:20:56,527 --> 01:20:58,613
Sarah?

668
01:21:00,198 --> 01:21:02,283
Sarah?

669
01:21:06,579 --> 01:21:09,040
Run!

670
01:21:37,443 --> 01:21:39,529
Oh, fuck!

671
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:14,397
Fuck.

672
01:22:14,439 --> 01:22:17,650
- Come on!
- Juno, stop her! I'll be right behind you!

673
01:22:40,089 --> 01:22:43,051
Sam! What are you doing?

674
01:22:43,092 --> 01:22:44,636
<i>Come back!</i>

675
01:22:44,677 --> 01:22:46,346
Becca!

676
01:22:46,387 --> 01:22:48,431
You haven't got enough rope!

677
01:22:48,473 --> 01:22:51,225
<i>Sam! Turn around!</i>

678
01:22:53,061 --> 01:22:55,396
- What are you doing? Turn around!
- Sam, baby!

679
01:22:55,438 --> 01:22:59,776
<i>- Sam! Sam!
- Sam, turn around. You can come back.</i>

680
01:22:59,817 --> 01:23:03,488
<i>Please, baby, listen to me. Please!</i>

681
01:23:07,241 --> 01:23:08,034
Sam!

682
01:23:11,537 --> 01:23:12,956
No!

683
01:23:13,957 --> 01:23:16,125
<i>What are you doing?</i>

684
01:23:26,344 --> 01:23:27,971
Sam!

685
01:23:34,727 --> 01:23:37,689
Sam! No!

686
01:25:52,865 --> 01:25:54,325
What happened to you?

687
01:25:58,371 --> 01:26:00,039
Rebecca?

688
01:26:06,004 --> 01:26:07,505
What about Beth?

689
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:12,844
Didn't make it.

690
01:26:19,267 --> 01:26:20,852
You saw her die?

691
01:26:33,656 --> 01:26:34,908
Come on.

692
01:27:32,715 --> 01:27:35,260
Come on. Come on.

693
01:30:43,615 --> 01:30:46,326
<i>No! No!</i>

694
01:32:26,467 --> 01:32:27,885
Oh, God!
