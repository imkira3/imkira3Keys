2
00:04:09,573 --> 00:04:12,534
It's gettin' cold.

3
00:04:15,704 --> 00:04:17,915
That is one fine frame.

4
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:21,502
One fine frame that is.

5
00:04:23,003 --> 00:04:25,005
How much...

6
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:30,761
does a fine frame like that cost,
do you think?

7
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:36,959
I never told you, but you sound a little
like Dr Seuss when you're drunk.

8
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:40,379
Anna. I'm serious.

9
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,481
Serious I am, Anna.

10
00:04:44,775 --> 00:04:48,220
I'd say it cost at least a couple hundred.

11
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,682
- I'm gonna read it for you.
- Do I really sound like Dr Seuss?

12
00:04:51,782 --> 00:04:54,894
"In recognition of his
outstanding achievement...

13
00:04:54,994 --> 00:04:59,356
in the field of child psychology,
his dedication to his work...

14
00:04:59,456 --> 00:05:03,485
and his continuing efforts
to improve the quality of life..."

15
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:06,197
Will you concentrate?

16
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:09,491
"...his continuing efforts to
improve the quality of life...

17
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:12,620
for countless children
and their families...

18
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,540
the city of Philadelphia
proudly bestows upon its son...

19
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,376
Dr Malcolm Crowe..." that's you...

20
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:22,521
"...the Mayor's Citation
for professional excellence."

21
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:27,343
They called you their son.

22
00:05:27,443 --> 00:05:30,137
Wow.

23
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:32,740
We should hang it in the bathroom.

24
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:39,772
This is an important night for us.

25
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:44,151
Finally, someone is recognizing
the sacrifices you've made...

26
00:05:44,251 --> 00:05:48,739
that you have put everything second,
including me...

27
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:52,009
for those families that
they're talking about.

28
00:05:55,804 --> 00:05:58,849
They're also saying that
my husband has a gift.

29
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:04,838
You have a gift that teaches children
how to be strong in situations...

30
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:07,775
where most adults
would piss on themselves.

31
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:11,695
I believe what they wrote is real.

32
00:06:15,991 --> 00:06:17,993
Thank you.

33
00:06:21,538 --> 00:06:24,233
I would like some wine in a glass.

34
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:28,545
I would not like it in a mug.
I would not like it in a jug.

35
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,947
Look.

36
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:40,743
Anna, don't move. Don't make a sound.

37
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:48,334
This is 47 Locus Street.

38
00:07:50,085 --> 00:07:52,112
You've broken a window
and entered a private residence.

39
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:54,423
You don't know so many things.

40
00:07:56,842 --> 00:08:00,929
There are no needles or prescription
drugs of any kind in this house.

41
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:12,799
Do you know why you're afraid
when you're alone?

42
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:21,208
- I do. I do.
- What do you want?

43
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:24,920
What he promised me!
I want what he promised.

44
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:27,547
- Oh, my God.
- Do I know you?

45
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,218
Don't you know me, hero?

46
00:08:31,318 --> 00:08:33,445
Don't you even remember your own patients?

47
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:40,685
Downtown clinic.

48
00:08:40,785 --> 00:08:43,246
Single-parent family.

49
00:08:44,831 --> 00:08:47,542
Possible mood disorder.

50
00:08:48,835 --> 00:08:51,029
I was afraid!

51
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:56,201
You told me I was having trouble
coping with my parents' divorce.

52
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:58,637
You were wrong. You were wrong.

53
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:04,417
Now look at me!

54
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:08,338
- I don't want to be afraid no more.
- Please, just give me a minute to think.

55
00:09:08,438 --> 00:09:11,174
I waited ten years for you!

56
00:09:11,274 --> 00:09:16,012
- I'm not giving you nothin'!
- Ben Friedkin?

57
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:20,433
Some people, they call me "freak."

58
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,435
Ryan Sumner?

59
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:25,246
I am. I am a freak. Look at...

60
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,708
Vincent.

61
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,461
Vincent Grey.

62
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:39,703
- No, you don't.
- I do remember you.

63
00:09:39,803 --> 00:09:42,097
Quiet, very smart.

64
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:46,209
Compassionate.

65
00:09:46,309 --> 00:09:48,812
Unusually compassionate.

66
00:09:50,855 --> 00:09:53,066
You forgot cursed.

67
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:58,847
You failed me.

68
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:00,949
You failed me!

69
00:10:04,619 --> 00:10:08,398
Vincent, I'm sorry if I wasn't...
if I didn't help you.

70
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:12,152
But if you just let me try...

71
00:10:12,252 --> 00:10:14,629
If you just give me a chance...

72
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:24,581
Oh, God! Oh, God, honey.

73
00:10:24,681 --> 00:10:26,683
- Did Vincent...
- Don't talk.

74
00:12:58,126 --> 00:13:00,237
It's okay, Cole.

75
00:13:00,337 --> 00:13:03,615
My name is Dr Malcolm Crowe.

76
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:07,911
We were supposed to meet today,
but I missed our appointment.

77
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:09,554
I'm sorry.

78
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:23,343
You know, in the olden days in Europe,
people used to hide out in churches.

79
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:25,737
They would claim sanctuary.

80
00:13:30,867 --> 00:13:33,828
What were they hiding from?

81
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:38,692
Bad people, mostly.

82
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:43,254
People that wanted to
put them in jail, hurt them.

83
00:13:45,674 --> 00:13:50,370
I noticed your eyeglasses.
They don't have any lenses in them.

84
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:54,349
They're my dad's. The lenses hurt my eyes.

85
00:13:55,892 --> 00:14:00,355
What were you talking about with
your soldiers when I came in? Day...

86
00:14:04,818 --> 00:14:07,362
It's called Latin.

87
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:13,268
All your soldiers speak Latin?

88
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:16,329
No. Just one.

89
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,735
Are you a good doctor?

90
00:14:21,835 --> 00:14:23,461
Well...

91
00:14:24,587 --> 00:14:27,574
I used to be.

92
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:30,677
I won an award once from the mayor.

93
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,139
It had an expensive frame.

94
00:14:48,403 --> 00:14:53,116
- I'm gonna see you again, right?
- If that's okay with you.

95
00:15:27,275 --> 00:15:29,277
It's me.

96
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:18,829
Pennsylvania Turnpike westbound
slows at Valley Forge 24.

97
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:22,265
On the Blue Ridge, both directions generally
slow between number three and number two...

98
00:17:26,144 --> 00:17:28,146
Hey, good morning.

99
00:17:35,612 --> 00:17:37,614
Cole.

100
00:17:41,117 --> 00:17:44,020
Cole!

101
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,748
Hey, your Cocoa Puffs are gettin' soggy.

102
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:52,988
Let me see you. Oh, honey, you got a spot.

103
00:17:53,088 --> 00:17:55,090
Head up.

104
00:18:01,763 --> 00:18:03,765
Okay, here we go.

105
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:19,197
Something you were looking for, baby?

106
00:18:22,117 --> 00:18:24,119
Pop-Tarts?

107
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,081
They're right here.

108
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:31,418
Oh.

109
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:39,843
Well, what are you thinking, Mama?

110
00:18:41,636 --> 00:18:44,998
Lots of things.

111
00:18:45,098 --> 00:18:47,083
Anything bad about me?

112
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:50,170
Hey, look at my face.

113
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,981
I was not thinkin'
somethin' bad about you.

114
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:56,192
Got it?

115
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,405
Got it.

116
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,725
Here, head up.

117
00:19:03,825 --> 00:19:05,685
- That's Tommy, Mama.
- That's okay. You tuck it in.

118
00:19:05,785 --> 00:19:08,580
Hey, Cole, you want this?

119
00:19:38,818 --> 00:19:42,347
Hey, freak, how'd you like that
"arm around the shoulder" bit?

120
00:19:42,447 --> 00:19:44,891
I just made that up. I went with it.

121
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:47,786
It's what great actors do.
It's called improv.

122
00:20:26,574 --> 00:20:28,576
Hey, baby.

123
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,955
How was your day?

124
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:40,797
You know, you can tell me things
if you need to.

125
00:20:46,219 --> 00:20:49,331
Well, you know what I did today?

126
00:20:49,431 --> 00:20:53,810
I, uh, I won the Pennsylvania Lottery
in the morning...

127
00:20:55,186 --> 00:20:59,466
I quit my jobs, and I ate
a big picnic in the park...

128
00:20:59,566 --> 00:21:01,760
with lots of chocolate mousse pie.

129
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,180
And then I swam
in the fountain all afternoon.

130
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,074
What'd you do?

131
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:15,899
I was picked first for
kickball teams at recess.

132
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:18,401
I hit a grand slam to win the game.

133
00:21:18,501 --> 00:21:22,047
Everybody lifted me up on their shoulders
and carried me around, cheering.

134
00:21:26,927 --> 00:21:29,971
Well, in that case, I am gonna
make you some triangle pancakes.

135
00:21:31,097 --> 00:21:33,099
You got an hour.

136
00:21:38,939 --> 00:21:41,024
Hi.

137
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,405
Wanna sit?

138
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,245
Don't feel like talking today?

139
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,570
Wanna play a game?

140
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,905
It's a mind-reading game.

141
00:22:04,005 --> 00:22:06,032
Here's how it works.

142
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:08,535
I read your mind.

143
00:22:08,635 --> 00:22:11,872
If what I say is right,
you take one step towards the chair.

144
00:22:11,972 --> 00:22:18,003
If what I say is wrong, you take
one step back towards the doorway.

145
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,673
If you reach the chair, you sit down.

146
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:25,568
If you reach the door, you can go.

147
00:22:27,153 --> 00:22:29,155
Wanna play?

148
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:38,248
Okay.

149
00:22:54,014 --> 00:22:57,375
When your mother and father
were first divorced...

150
00:22:57,475 --> 00:23:02,714
your mom went to see a doctor like me,
and he didn't help her.

151
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:05,150
So you think I'm not going
to be able to help you.

152
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:25,654
You're worried that she said
she told him things...

153
00:23:25,754 --> 00:23:28,089
things she couldn't tell anyone else.

154
00:23:29,424 --> 00:23:31,343
Secrets.

155
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,810
You have a secret,
but you don't want to tell me.

156
00:23:54,741 --> 00:23:58,286
Your dad gave you that watch
as a present just before he went away.

157
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,741
He forgot it in a drawer.

158
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:13,593
Doesn't work.

159
00:24:25,647 --> 00:24:29,050
You keep pretty quiet in school, but...

160
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:33,989
you're a good student, you've never
really been in any serious trouble.

161
00:24:41,329 --> 00:24:43,982
We were supposed to draw a picture.

162
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:46,084
Anything we wanted.

163
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:51,406
I drew a man.

164
00:24:51,506 --> 00:24:54,426
He got hurt in the neck by
another man with a screwdriver.

165
00:24:58,054 --> 00:25:00,265
You saw that on TV, Cole?

166
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:07,756
Everyone got upset.

167
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:10,634
They had a meeting.

168
00:25:10,734 --> 00:25:13,470
Mom started crying.

169
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:15,780
I don't draw like that any more.

170
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,451
How do you draw now?

171
00:25:21,578 --> 00:25:24,039
I draw people smiling...

172
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:27,167
dogs running...

173
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,587
rainbows.

174
00:25:31,713 --> 00:25:34,883
They don't have meetings about rainbows.

175
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:39,220
No. I guess they don't.

176
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,466
What am I thinking now?

177
00:25:51,566 --> 00:25:54,319
I don't know what you're thinking now.

178
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:04,412
I was thinking you're nice...

179
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,084
but you can't help me.

180
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:29,271
I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.

181
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,321
I'm so sorry, Anna.

182
00:26:39,656 --> 00:26:42,450
I just can't seem to keep track of time.

183
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,123
And I didn't have
a very good session today. I...

184
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,363
They're both so similar.

185
00:26:55,463 --> 00:27:00,051
The same mannerisms, same expressions,
same things hanging over their head.

186
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,432
I think it might be some kind of abuse.

187
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:10,253
Cole has scratches on his arm.

188
00:27:10,353 --> 00:27:12,964
I think they might be fingernail cuts.

189
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:15,358
Defensive cuts, maybe. I don't know.

190
00:27:17,902 --> 00:27:20,347
Maybe a teacher or a neighbour.

191
00:27:20,447 --> 00:27:23,642
I don't think it's the mother.
I've seen her with him, and...

192
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,827
it doesn't seem to fit.

193
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:33,710
Or I could just be wrong. Maybe he's
just a kid who likes to climb trees a lot.

194
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,554
Anna.

195
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,376
I know that I've been
a little distant, all right?

196
00:27:49,476 --> 00:27:53,129
I know that it makes you mad.
I just feel like I've been given...

197
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:55,982
a second chance,
and I don't want it to slip away.

198
00:27:58,193 --> 00:28:00,195
Anna.

199
00:28:01,404 --> 00:28:03,406
Happy anniversary.

200
00:28:13,124 --> 00:28:18,071
Stop looking at me. I don't like
when people look at me like that.

201
00:28:18,171 --> 00:28:19,547
Okay.

202
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:24,703
I walk this way to school
with Tommy Tammisimo.

203
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:28,707
- He your best buddy?
- He hates me.

204
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:31,209
Do you hate him?

205
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,311
No.

206
00:28:34,854 --> 00:28:37,257
Did your mom set that up?

207
00:28:37,357 --> 00:28:39,359
Yes.

208
00:28:41,319 --> 00:28:43,346
Did you ever talk to your mom
about how things are with Tommy?

209
00:28:43,446 --> 00:28:46,600
- I don't tell her things.
- Why not?

210
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,935
'Cause she doesn't look at me like
everybody else, and I don't want her to.

211
00:28:49,035 --> 00:28:52,147
- I don't want her to know.
- Know what?

212
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:54,691
That I'm a freak.

213
00:28:54,791 --> 00:28:56,902
Hey.

214
00:28:57,002 --> 00:29:00,947
You are not a freak. Okay?

215
00:29:01,047 --> 00:29:05,785
Don't you believe anybody that tries to
convince you of that. That's bullshit.

216
00:29:05,885 --> 00:29:08,305
You don't have to go through
your life believing that.

217
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:11,891
Okay?

218
00:29:14,394 --> 00:29:16,396
Come on.

219
00:29:19,566 --> 00:29:23,637
- You said the "S" word.
- Yeah, I know.

220
00:29:23,737 --> 00:29:25,739
Sorry.

221
00:30:33,223 --> 00:30:36,559
So your dad lives in Pittsburgh
with a lady that works in a tollbooth.

222
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:43,049
I wonder if she has to pee
when she's working.

223
00:30:43,149 --> 00:30:45,177
Think she just holds it?

224
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,571
I don't know. I was just
thinking about that myself.

225
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:52,350
You asked a lot of questions
about Dad today.

226
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,644
How come?

227
00:30:54,744 --> 00:30:59,399
Well, sometimes we do things
to draw attention...

228
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:03,737
to express our feelings
about certain issues...

229
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:07,157
divorce, whatever.

230
00:31:07,257 --> 00:31:09,326
For example, a person might
leave something on a desk...

231
00:31:09,426 --> 00:31:12,012
for someone else to find.

232
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:18,101
Do you know what free-association
writing is, Cole?

233
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:21,588
No.

234
00:31:21,688 --> 00:31:26,635
Free-association writing is when you
take a pencil in your hand, and...

235
00:31:26,735 --> 00:31:31,223
you put the pencil to a piece
of paper and you start writing.

236
00:31:31,323 --> 00:31:33,808
And you don't look at what you're writing
or think about what you're writing.

237
00:31:33,908 --> 00:31:37,687
You just keep your hand moving.

238
00:31:37,787 --> 00:31:41,525
And after a while, if you keep
your hand moving long enough...

239
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:45,862
words and thoughts start coming out that
you didn't even know you had in you.

240
00:31:45,962 --> 00:31:49,825
It could be something
you heard somewhere else...

241
00:31:49,925 --> 00:31:53,929
or feelings you had deep inside of you.

242
00:31:57,599 --> 00:32:00,185
Have you ever done any
free-association writing, Cole?

243
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,799
Yes.

244
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:08,068
What did you write?

245
00:32:09,611 --> 00:32:11,613
Upset words.

246
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,743
Did you ever write any upset words
before your father left?

247
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:20,080
I don't remember.

248
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,209
Can you do something for me?

249
00:32:26,544 --> 00:32:30,824
I want you to think about what you
wanna get out of our time together...

250
00:32:30,924 --> 00:32:33,493
what our goal should be.

251
00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:35,637
Something I want?

252
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,583
If you could change something
in your life, anything at all...

253
00:32:39,683 --> 00:32:41,793
what would it be?

254
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:45,480
Instead of something I want,
can it be something I don't want?

255
00:32:47,274 --> 00:32:49,968
Okay.

256
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:52,696
I don't want to be scared any more.

257
00:33:05,125 --> 00:33:07,127
You gonna get that?

258
00:33:13,842 --> 00:33:15,844
Are you gonna get that?

259
00:33:21,016 --> 00:33:22,918
- Hi.
- Hi.

260
00:33:23,018 --> 00:33:25,295
- Don't you see enough of me at the store?
- Yeah, I'm on my way...

261
00:33:25,395 --> 00:33:27,380
out to the flea market
in the Amish country.

262
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,841
I thought maybe you'd wanna come along
and show me how to buy...

263
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,385
at one of these things.

264
00:33:32,485 --> 00:33:34,471
I don't know if I can deal
with the Amish today.

265
00:33:34,571 --> 00:33:38,892
I can't curse or spit
or anything around them.

266
00:33:38,992 --> 00:33:41,394
I just figured maybe you'd just want
to get out and get some air...

267
00:33:41,494 --> 00:33:43,830
because you've seemed kind of down lately.

268
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,335
Um, I'm okay.

269
00:33:49,753 --> 00:33:52,072
All right. Do you think that maybe
I should stop by on my way back?

270
00:33:52,172 --> 00:33:55,700
Show you what I've got?
'Cause that wouldn't be a problem.

271
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,079
No, I... You know, I can see it on Monday.

272
00:33:59,179 --> 00:34:02,040
Sure, yeah, that's fine. I'm just...

273
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,915
Okay, so I guess I'm gonna get going then,
and I'll speak to you later.

274
00:34:06,015 --> 00:34:08,688
- Don't step in the horse manure.
- Thank you very much.

275
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:21,201
Keep moving, cheese dick.

276
00:34:44,975 --> 00:34:49,629
Can anybody guess what city was capital
of the United States of America...

277
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:53,900
from 1790 to 1800?

278
00:34:57,153 --> 00:35:00,682
I'll give you a hint:
It's the city you live in.

279
00:35:00,782 --> 00:35:03,727
- Philadelphia!
- Right, right.

280
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:06,062
Philadelphia is one of
the oldest cities in this country.

281
00:35:06,162 --> 00:35:09,232
Lot of generations have
lived here and died here.

282
00:35:09,332 --> 00:35:13,445
Almost any place you go in this city
has a history and a story behind it...

283
00:35:13,545 --> 00:35:16,698
even this school
and the grounds it sits on.

284
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:21,244
Can anyone guess what this building
was used for a hundred years ago...

285
00:35:21,344 --> 00:35:25,181
before you went to school here,
before I went to this school even?

286
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:34,649
Yes, Cole.

287
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:39,070
They used to hang people here.

288
00:35:43,867 --> 00:35:48,313
No, uh, that... Mm-mm. That's not correct.
Where'd you hear that?

289
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:52,692
They pulled the people in,
crying and kissing their families bye.

290
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:56,546
People watching spit at them.

291
00:35:58,381 --> 00:36:02,828
Uh, Cole, this... this building
was a legal courthouse.

292
00:36:02,928 --> 00:36:06,206
Laws were passed here... some of
the very first laws of this country.

293
00:36:06,306 --> 00:36:09,417
This whole building was full of,
uh, lawyers, lawmakers.

294
00:36:09,517 --> 00:36:11,811
They were the ones that hanged everybody.

295
00:36:14,022 --> 00:36:16,216
Uh... Look, I do...

296
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:18,635
I don't know which one
of these guys told you that...

297
00:36:18,735 --> 00:36:21,947
but, uh, they were
just trying to scare you.

298
00:36:31,873 --> 00:36:34,793
I don't like people
looking at me like that.

299
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,282
- Like what?
- Stop it!

300
00:36:40,382 --> 00:36:43,802
I, uh, I don't know how else to look. I...

301
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:48,223
You're Stuttering Stanley!

302
00:36:51,017 --> 00:36:52,284
Excuse me?

303
00:36:52,384 --> 00:36:55,839
You talked funny when you went to school.
You talked funny all the way to high school.

304
00:36:56,273 --> 00:36:57,256
What?

305
00:36:57,356 --> 00:36:59,986
You shouldn't look at people.
It makes them feel bad.

306
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:02,095
- How did you...
- Stop looking at me!

307
00:37:02,195 --> 00:37:06,683
- Who have you been speaking-ing to?
- Stuttering Stanley!

308
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:10,228
- Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
- Stop it.

309
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:13,940
- Stop it! Stop that!
- Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!

310
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:17,486
- Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
- Stop it!

311
00:37:17,586 --> 00:37:22,424
- Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering...
- Shut up, you freak!

312
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,482
Hey, big guy.

313
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,489
How's it goin'?

314
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:48,475
I don't wanna talk
about anything right now.

315
00:37:48,575 --> 00:37:50,577
Okay.

316
00:38:05,258 --> 00:38:07,260
You like magic?

317
00:38:13,475 --> 00:38:17,796
Observe: The magic penny.

318
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:20,340
Looks like an ordinary penny.

319
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,901
But I do my little magic shake, and...

320
00:38:24,444 --> 00:38:26,721
now it's in my right hand.

321
00:38:26,821 --> 00:38:29,850
But that's not the end of the magic trick.

322
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:32,702
I do another little shake, and...

323
00:38:35,205 --> 00:38:38,441
right there in the vest pocket.

324
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,902
But that's not the end of the magic trick.

325
00:38:41,002 --> 00:38:43,530
I do another little shake...

326
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,632
and...

327
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:50,095
right back in the left hand
where it started.

328
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:55,749
- That isn't magic.
- What are you talking about?

329
00:38:55,849 --> 00:38:57,544
Of course it's magic.

330
00:38:57,644 --> 00:39:00,313
You just kept the penny
in that hand the whole time.

331
00:39:05,402 --> 00:39:07,028
Think so?

332
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:11,616
I didn't know you were funny.

333
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,425
Malcolm, sit your cute
butt down and listen up.

334
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,164
No doubt about it. Anna is like my sister.

335
00:39:34,264 --> 00:39:37,459
And you better make her happy.
And I'm not talkin' about no...

336
00:39:37,559 --> 00:39:40,170
"Mmm, this taste like real butter"
kind of happy.

337
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,048
I'm talkin' about... Just let it go.

338
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:45,634
'Julie Andrews, mm-hmm,
twirling around like...

339
00:39:45,734 --> 00:39:48,386
a mental patient on a mountaintop"
kind of happy.

340
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,031
Now, that's the kind of happy
I'm talkin' about.

341
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:56,186
Come here. Don't tell her I told you...

342
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:59,564
but she said she knew she love you...

343
00:39:59,664 --> 00:40:02,709
from the first time
she met you on the street.

344
00:40:04,044 --> 00:40:06,212
He'd do anything for you.

345
00:40:08,548 --> 00:40:11,343
I love you guys.

346
00:40:13,386 --> 00:40:16,264
My nose is running. Turn it...

347
00:41:34,634 --> 00:41:37,662
And then you do the magic shake.

348
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:40,207
The penny has moved from my pocket...

349
00:41:40,307 --> 00:41:42,684
all the way back
to the hand it started in.

350
00:41:45,395 --> 00:41:47,397
That's stupid.

351
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:51,927
It's supposed to be funny.

352
00:41:52,027 --> 00:41:55,363
It's stupid. I want my penny back.

353
00:41:58,074 --> 00:42:01,394
- He doesn't get invited places, so...
- It's our pleasure.

354
00:42:01,494 --> 00:42:04,981
Last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party
a year ago.

355
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:08,944
He hid in one of those purple
plastic tunnels and didn't come out.

356
00:42:09,044 --> 00:42:13,114
- Chuck E. Who?
- Cheese. It's a kids' place.

357
00:42:13,214 --> 00:42:15,300
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

358
00:42:49,876 --> 00:42:51,962
Is someone out there?

359
00:42:53,171 --> 00:42:55,490
Open this door, please. Come on.

360
00:42:55,590 --> 00:43:00,453
I can't breathe.
If you can hear me, open this door.

361
00:43:00,553 --> 00:43:04,708
I swear on my life I didn't
take the master's horse.

362
00:43:04,808 --> 00:43:08,461
Open this door,
or I'll break through it and grab you!

363
00:43:08,561 --> 00:43:11,943
The star of the commercial
always gets his own trailer.

364
00:43:12,043 --> 00:43:13,049
For what?

365
00:43:13,149 --> 00:43:16,219
He needs a place to think
about his character, alone.

366
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,655
You only had one line.

367
00:43:21,241 --> 00:43:23,368
Derrick, check it out.

368
00:43:24,619 --> 00:43:27,956
Oh, yeah. My dad made me invite him.

369
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:49,069
Happy birthday, Derrick.

370
00:43:49,753 --> 00:43:51,281
Is there somethin'
you want to see in there?

371
00:43:51,381 --> 00:43:53,208
No.

372
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,678
We're gonna put on a pretend play.

373
00:43:58,778 --> 00:44:02,933
- Wanna be in it?
- Okay.

374
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:05,685
It's called "Locked in the Dungeon."

375
00:44:05,785 --> 00:44:09,122
Yeah, Cole, and, uh, you get to be
the one locked in the dungeon.

376
00:44:13,168 --> 00:44:15,462
Don't! Don't! Don't! Don't!

377
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:18,698
Don't!

378
00:44:18,798 --> 00:44:21,159
Let me out! No! No! No!

379
00:44:21,259 --> 00:44:23,261
No! No! No!

380
00:44:42,155 --> 00:44:44,933
Mom!

381
00:44:45,033 --> 00:44:47,269
No, no, no!

382
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:49,371
Cole?

383
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:54,985
Cole!

384
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:57,571
Is there a key for this door? Cole?

385
00:44:57,671 --> 00:45:00,131
Honey, honey, can you hear me?

386
00:45:05,595 --> 00:45:10,600
- Oh, my God! Cole!
- Oh, my God! Help me! Help! Help!

387
00:45:22,654 --> 00:45:26,016
The tests would indicate
he did not have a seizure.

388
00:45:26,116 --> 00:45:28,101
He's doing fine.

389
00:45:28,201 --> 00:45:30,620
After some rest, he can go home tonight.

390
00:45:37,544 --> 00:45:41,072
There are some cuts
and bruises on your son...

391
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,425
- that are concerning me.
- Oh, man.

392
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:48,513
Yeah, those are from sports.

393
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:56,521
You think I hurt my child?

394
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:02,010
You think I'm a bad mother?

395
00:46:02,110 --> 00:46:04,346
Mrs Sloan over there...

396
00:46:04,446 --> 00:46:06,848
she's a social worker with the hospital...

397
00:46:06,948 --> 00:46:10,894
and she's gonna ask you a couple
procedural questions.

398
00:46:10,994 --> 00:46:14,439
What happened to my child today?

399
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:18,877
Something was happening to him, physically
happening. Something was very wrong!

400
00:46:23,298 --> 00:46:25,300
Hey.

401
00:46:36,603 --> 00:46:39,022
Did your father used to
tell you bedtime stories?

402
00:46:49,616 --> 00:46:53,520
Once upon a time
there was this young prince...

403
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:57,399
and he decided that
he wanted to go for a drive.

404
00:46:57,499 --> 00:47:03,113
And he got his driver,
and they started driving.

405
00:47:03,213 --> 00:47:05,215
Driving, driving.

406
00:47:06,883 --> 00:47:10,220
Driving a lot. And, uh, um...

407
00:47:11,346 --> 00:47:14,708
they drove so much that he fell asleep.

408
00:47:14,808 --> 00:47:16,810
And...

409
00:47:19,938 --> 00:47:23,884
then he woke up, and he realized
they were still driving.

410
00:47:23,984 --> 00:47:26,278
- This was a very long trip.
- Dr Crowe?

411
00:47:27,821 --> 00:47:30,765
You haven't told bedtime stories before.

412
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:33,059
Uh, not too many, no.

413
00:47:33,159 --> 00:47:35,620
You have to add some twists and stuff.

414
00:47:37,414 --> 00:47:39,583
Okay. Some twists.

415
00:47:41,585 --> 00:47:44,421
Like what kind of twists?
Give me an example.

416
00:47:46,298 --> 00:47:49,784
- Maybe they run out of gas.
- They run out of gas?

417
00:47:49,884 --> 00:47:52,954
That's good, 'cause they're
driving, right? Okay, so...

418
00:47:53,054 --> 00:47:55,432
Tell me the story about why you're sad.

419
00:47:58,435 --> 00:48:00,437
You think I'm sad?

420
00:48:03,273 --> 00:48:05,275
What makes you think that?

421
00:48:07,444 --> 00:48:09,446
Your eyes told me.

422
00:48:11,239 --> 00:48:13,825
Not supposed to talk
about stuff like that.

423
00:48:25,337 --> 00:48:29,199
Once upon a time, there was
this person named Malcolm.

424
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:31,426
He worked with children.

425
00:48:32,552 --> 00:48:35,080
He loved it.

426
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:38,141
He loved it more than anything else.

427
00:48:40,602 --> 00:48:43,880
And then one night,
he found out that he made a...

428
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,508
mistake with one of them.

429
00:48:46,608 --> 00:48:48,777
He couldn't help that one.

430
00:48:50,111 --> 00:48:54,866
And he can't stop thinking about it.
He, uh, can't forget.

431
00:48:58,244 --> 00:49:00,538
Ever since then,
things have been different.

432
00:49:02,332 --> 00:49:05,335
He's not the same person
that he used to be.

433
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:13,201
And his wife doesn't like
the person that he's become.

434
00:49:13,301 --> 00:49:15,845
They barely speak any more.
They're like strangers.

435
00:49:19,224 --> 00:49:22,961
And then one day, Malcolm meets
this wonderful little boy.

436
00:49:23,061 --> 00:49:26,715
A really cool little boy.

437
00:49:26,815 --> 00:49:29,567
He reminds him a lot of the other one.

438
00:49:31,945 --> 00:49:35,198
And Malcolm decides
to try and help this new boy...

439
00:49:37,325 --> 00:49:41,938
'cause he feels that
if he could help this new boy...

440
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:46,167
it'd be like helping that other one too.

441
00:49:49,713 --> 00:49:51,798
How does the story end?

442
00:49:53,842 --> 00:49:55,844
I don't know.

443
00:50:13,403 --> 00:50:15,739
I wanna tell you my secret now.

444
00:50:20,785 --> 00:50:22,662
Okay.

445
00:50:29,711 --> 00:50:32,255
I see dead people.

446
00:50:35,342 --> 00:50:37,844
In your dreams?

447
00:50:39,721 --> 00:50:42,057
While you're awake?

448
00:50:47,062 --> 00:50:51,341
Dead people, like, in graves, in coffins?

449
00:50:51,441 --> 00:50:53,777
Walking around like regular people.

450
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:57,389
They don't see each other.

451
00:50:57,489 --> 00:51:00,200
They only see what they wanna see.

452
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:04,454
They don't know they're dead.

453
00:51:06,039 --> 00:51:08,291
How often do you see them?

454
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:14,214
All the time.

455
00:51:16,591 --> 00:51:18,593
They're everywhere.

456
00:51:21,554 --> 00:51:24,624
You won't tell anyone my secret, right?

457
00:51:24,724 --> 00:51:27,143
No. I promise.

458
00:51:29,312 --> 00:51:32,148
Will you stay here until I fall asleep?

459
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:36,695
Of course.

460
00:51:46,913 --> 00:51:52,335
Cole has pathologies more severe
than initially assessed.

461
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:56,323
He's suffering from
visual hallucinations...

462
00:51:56,423 --> 00:51:59,117
paranoia...

463
00:51:59,217 --> 00:52:03,388
some kind of school-age schizophrenia.

464
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:09,144
Medication, hospitalization
may be required.

465
00:52:15,358 --> 00:52:17,611
And I'm not helping him.

466
00:53:44,906 --> 00:53:47,575
Hi. This is Lynn Sear, Cole's mom.

467
00:53:49,077 --> 00:53:52,314
Yeah, uh... Yeah, I'd like
to talk to you about...

468
00:53:52,414 --> 00:53:56,585
your boy and his friends keeping
their goddam hands off my son.

469
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:35,767
Mama?

470
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:40,839
No, dinner is not ready!

471
00:55:40,939 --> 00:55:44,442
What are you gonna do?
You can't hurt me any more!

472
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:49,764
Neddy! You're a terrible husband! Neddy!

473
00:55:49,864 --> 00:55:53,034
Look what you made me do! Neddy!

474
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:17,392
Once there was a boy,
very different from all the other boys.

475
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:21,338
He lived in the jungle...

476
00:56:21,438 --> 00:56:23,940
and he could speak to the animals.

477
00:56:39,331 --> 00:56:41,666
Did you think the play sucked big time?

478
00:56:43,376 --> 00:56:44,903
What?

479
00:56:45,003 --> 00:56:48,281
Tommy Tammisimo acted
in a cough syrup commercial.

480
00:56:48,381 --> 00:56:51,159
He said everyone was self-conscious
and unrealistic.

481
00:56:51,259 --> 00:56:53,370
He said the play sucked big time.

482
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,181
This Tommy kid sounds like a real punk.

483
00:56:58,141 --> 00:57:00,894
I thought the play was excellent.
Better than Cats.

484
00:57:02,020 --> 00:57:04,397
- Cats?
- Never mind.

485
00:57:07,192 --> 00:57:10,428
Cole, I was really interested
in what you told me at the hospital.

486
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:12,614
I'd like to hear more about it.

487
00:57:23,208 --> 00:57:25,210
Cole?

488
00:57:28,755 --> 00:57:30,757
What?

489
00:57:42,894 --> 00:57:44,896
Is something up there?

490
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:51,444
Cole?

491
00:57:55,073 --> 00:57:57,075
I don't see anything.

492
00:58:01,496 --> 00:58:03,498
Be real still.

493
00:58:08,086 --> 00:58:10,322
Sometimes you feel it inside...

494
00:58:10,422 --> 00:58:13,158
like you're falling down real fast...

495
00:58:13,258 --> 00:58:16,027
but you're really just standing still.

496
00:58:20,807 --> 00:58:23,977
You ever feel the prickly things
on the back of your neck?

497
00:58:25,270 --> 00:58:26,896
Yes.

498
00:58:28,189 --> 00:58:32,052
And the tiny hairs on your arm,
you know, when they stand up?

499
00:58:32,152 --> 00:58:33,570
Yes.

500
00:58:36,489 --> 00:58:38,074
That's them.

501
00:58:41,870 --> 00:58:43,872
They get mad.

502
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,961
It gets cold.

503
00:59:07,187 --> 00:59:10,231
I don't see anything.
Are you sure they're there?

504
00:59:12,651 --> 00:59:14,235
Cole.

505
00:59:16,738 --> 00:59:19,474
Please make them leave.

506
00:59:19,574 --> 00:59:21,576
I'm working on it.

507
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:26,081
Come on.

508
01:00:11,042 --> 01:00:13,044
Mommy, Daddy?

509
01:00:16,464 --> 01:00:18,550
My throat hurts.

510
01:00:27,517 --> 01:00:29,519
Run. Run!

511
01:00:31,146 --> 01:00:32,964
Pedia Ease cough suppressant.

512
01:00:33,064 --> 01:00:36,009
Gentle, fast, effec...

513
01:00:36,109 --> 01:00:37,569
Cole.

514
01:00:38,820 --> 01:00:41,448
I don't care what they say.
This thing is broken.

515
01:00:49,623 --> 01:00:51,625
Take 'em off.

516
01:00:55,462 --> 01:00:57,464
I don't want them on my table.

517
01:01:02,469 --> 01:01:05,580
I saw what was in your bureau drawer
when I was cleaning.

518
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,766
Got something you want to confess?

519
01:01:12,437 --> 01:01:15,482
The bumblebee pendant?
Why do you keep taking it?

520
01:01:20,695 --> 01:01:22,848
It was Grandma's.

521
01:01:22,948 --> 01:01:25,408
You know, what if it broke?
You know how sad I'd be.

522
01:01:28,411 --> 01:01:30,622
You cry 'cause you miss Grandma so much.

523
01:01:32,374 --> 01:01:34,376
That's right.

524
01:01:38,713 --> 01:01:41,883
Sometimes people think they lose things...

525
01:01:44,177 --> 01:01:47,013
and they really didn't lose them,
it just gets moved.

526
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:50,225
So did you move the bumblebee pendant?

527
01:01:58,858 --> 01:02:00,886
Don't get mad.

528
01:02:00,986 --> 01:02:03,054
So who moved it this time?

529
01:02:03,154 --> 01:02:06,808
Maybe someone came in our house, took
the bumblebee pendant out of my closet...

530
01:02:06,908 --> 01:02:08,910
and placed it nicely in your drawer.

531
01:02:10,370 --> 01:02:13,607
- Maybe.
- God, I am so tired, Cole.

532
01:02:13,707 --> 01:02:16,234
I'm tired in my body,
I'm tired in my mind...

533
01:02:16,334 --> 01:02:19,237
I'm tired in my heart.

534
01:02:19,337 --> 01:02:21,615
I need some help.

535
01:02:21,715 --> 01:02:24,676
You know, I don't know if you notice,
but our little family isn't doin' so good.

536
01:02:25,969 --> 01:02:29,306
I mean, I've been prayin'.
I must not be prayin' right.

537
01:02:31,182 --> 01:02:34,227
Looks like we're just gonna
have to answer each other's prayers.

538
01:02:37,606 --> 01:02:39,733
If we can't talk to each other,
we're not gonna make it.

539
01:02:44,237 --> 01:02:47,933
Now, tell me, baby.
I won't get mad, honey.

540
01:02:48,033 --> 01:02:50,035
Did you take the bumblebee pendant?

541
01:02:59,002 --> 01:03:00,462
No.

542
01:03:03,256 --> 01:03:06,301
You've had enough roast beef.
You need to leave the table.

543
01:03:08,637 --> 01:03:10,221
Go!

544
01:03:33,828 --> 01:03:37,707
Hey, come on. I'll show you
where my dad keeps his gun. Come on.

545
01:03:45,090 --> 01:03:47,492
Sebastian, come on.

546
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:49,094
Mama?

547
01:03:56,101 --> 01:03:58,587
If you're not very mad...

548
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:00,855
could I sleep in your bed tonight?

549
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,927
Look at my face.

550
01:04:06,027 --> 01:04:08,029
I'm not very mad.

551
01:04:13,201 --> 01:04:15,287
Baby, why are you shaking?

552
01:04:16,746 --> 01:04:19,065
Cole, what's wrong?

553
01:04:19,165 --> 01:04:22,861
Oh, God! Please tell me!

554
01:04:22,961 --> 01:04:24,963
Oh, please.

555
01:04:28,425 --> 01:04:30,010
Oh.

556
01:04:39,394 --> 01:04:42,214
It's Edwardian, beautifully worked...

557
01:04:42,314 --> 01:04:46,276
with mine-cut diamonds
and an actual colour Burmese sapphire.

558
01:04:47,485 --> 01:04:50,905
- It's timeless.
- Oh.

559
01:04:53,158 --> 01:04:56,703
Have you, uh, got anything
a little plainer?

560
01:04:58,121 --> 01:05:02,859
"Plainer"? You want a plain ring to go
with your plain fiancée, is that how it is?

561
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:05,754
No, baby, don't... don't get in a tizzy.

562
01:05:09,007 --> 01:05:11,968
Uh, you're so beautiful.

563
01:05:13,762 --> 01:05:17,415
Uh, you're like a Burmese sapphire
all by yourself.

564
01:05:17,515 --> 01:05:20,126
- You don't need all that.
- Uh-huh.

565
01:05:20,226 --> 01:05:24,773
Why don't you try it on
and see how you both feel about it.

566
01:05:30,570 --> 01:05:32,656
There. How does that feel?

567
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:38,395
I think this piece, um,
communicates a longing.

568
01:05:38,495 --> 01:05:43,708
I imagine that the woman who owned it
loved a man that she couldn't be with.

569
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:49,239
Did he have wavy hair and chestnut eyes?

570
01:05:49,339 --> 01:05:53,493
Um, I don't know, but...

571
01:05:53,593 --> 01:05:55,829
a lot of the pieces
in this store communicate...

572
01:05:55,929 --> 01:05:59,057
and I think you should choose
a piece that speaks to you.

573
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:05,230
I think maybe when people own things
and then they pass away...

574
01:06:06,439 --> 01:06:09,843
a part of themselves
gets printed on those things...

575
01:06:09,943 --> 01:06:13,029
like... like fingerprints.

576
01:06:15,657 --> 01:06:17,659
I'll just wrap it up.

577
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:26,985
You don't need a guy with a Master's.

578
01:06:27,085 --> 01:06:30,113
You need a wrestler with a neck
larger than his head.

579
01:06:30,213 --> 01:06:32,507
No, I need a wrestler with a Master's.

580
01:06:34,175 --> 01:06:36,703
- What's this?
- Happy birthday.

581
01:06:36,803 --> 01:06:38,805
- From you?
- Mm-hmm.

582
01:06:46,688 --> 01:06:49,858
It's a first edition.

583
01:06:50,984 --> 01:06:52,235
Wow.

584
01:06:53,528 --> 01:06:56,348
- You know, this is too much.
- No.

585
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:58,450
Took it out of your Christmas bonus.

586
01:07:00,035 --> 01:07:02,037
It's perfect, Anna.

587
01:07:02,954 --> 01:07:04,414
Thanks.

588
01:07:10,837 --> 01:07:12,839
What do you want more than anything?

589
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,826
I don't know.

590
01:07:15,926 --> 01:07:17,928
I told you what I want.

591
01:07:21,556 --> 01:07:23,558
I know what I want.

592
01:07:25,727 --> 01:07:27,729
I want to be able
to talk to my wife again.

593
01:07:30,607 --> 01:07:32,609
The way we used to talk to each other.

594
01:07:34,277 --> 01:07:36,863
Like there was no one else
in the world except us.

595
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:40,909
How are you gonna do that?

596
01:07:46,456 --> 01:07:48,458
Can't be your doctor any more.

597
01:07:49,793 --> 01:07:51,962
I haven't paid
enough attention to my family.

598
01:07:53,088 --> 01:07:55,257
Bad things happen when you do that.

599
01:07:57,008 --> 01:07:59,995
Do you understand?

600
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:02,122
I'm gonna transfer you.
I know two psychologists...

601
01:08:02,222 --> 01:08:04,307
Don't fail me.

602
01:08:05,976 --> 01:08:08,561
Don't give up. You're the only one
who can help me. I know it.

603
01:08:10,188 --> 01:08:12,190
I can't help you.

604
01:08:15,193 --> 01:08:17,429
You...

605
01:08:17,529 --> 01:08:19,531
Someone else can help you.

606
01:08:22,742 --> 01:08:24,828
You believe me, right?

607
01:08:29,499 --> 01:08:31,876
Dr Crowe, you believe my secret, right?

608
01:08:34,254 --> 01:08:36,339
I don't know how to answer that, Cole.

609
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:49,019
How can you help me...

610
01:08:50,312 --> 01:08:52,314
if you don't believe me?

611
01:08:57,527 --> 01:08:59,529
Some magic's real.

612
01:09:16,004 --> 01:09:18,632
Do you know why you're afraid
when you're alone?

613
01:09:21,593 --> 01:09:24,095
I do. I do.

614
01:09:31,311 --> 01:09:33,855
I'm sorry about that, Vincent. I hope
I didn't leave you alone too long.

615
01:09:35,523 --> 01:09:37,859
Whew. It's cold in here.

616
01:09:41,446 --> 01:09:44,074
Vincent, why are you crying?

617
01:09:50,705 --> 01:09:52,707
You won't believe.

618
01:09:57,629 --> 01:10:00,674
I'm sorry about that, Vincent. I hope
I didn't leave you alone too long.

619
01:10:01,841 --> 01:10:04,261
Whew. It's cold in here.

620
01:10:07,722 --> 01:10:09,307
Vincent...

621
01:10:10,892 --> 01:10:13,228
Whew. It's cold in here.

622
01:10:21,319 --> 01:10:24,139
No, you know what?
I never liked 'em either.

623
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,600
When I was a kid, I had
this blood test done...

624
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:30,412
and I threw up chili cheese fries
all over this male nurse.

625
01:10:32,372 --> 01:10:35,192
Excuse me. Dr Reed is on line two.

626
01:10:35,292 --> 01:10:37,277
Vincent, will you excuse me?
I have to take this.

627
01:10:37,377 --> 01:10:40,046
- Um, just give me a minute, okay?
- Okay.

628
01:12:09,552 --> 01:12:10,845
Oh, my God.

629
01:12:18,979 --> 01:12:20,981
You been running around?

630
01:12:24,693 --> 01:12:26,945
Make you feel better?

631
01:12:28,363 --> 01:12:30,949
I like to run around. It's good exercise.

632
01:12:34,744 --> 01:12:36,830
Do you want to ask me questions now?

633
01:12:38,999 --> 01:12:42,611
Wanna be a lance corporal in Company M,
Third Battalion, Seventh Marines?

634
01:12:42,711 --> 01:12:45,697
We're being dispatched
into the Quang Nam province.

635
01:12:45,797 --> 01:12:48,258
Maybe later.

636
01:12:50,510 --> 01:12:52,512
Something happened, didn't it?

637
01:12:55,724 --> 01:12:56,975
You wiggin' out?

638
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:02,897
Yes, I think I am.

639
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:08,929
You know what "Yo no quiero morir" means?

640
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:12,365
It's Spanish. It means
"I don't want to die."

641
01:13:14,993 --> 01:13:17,495
What do you think these ghosts want
when they talk to you?

642
01:13:25,754 --> 01:13:27,797
I want you to think about it, Cole.

643
01:13:29,466 --> 01:13:31,551
I want you to think about it
really carefully.

644
01:13:33,053 --> 01:13:35,055
What do you think they want?

645
01:13:39,559 --> 01:13:41,837
- Just help.
- That's right.

646
01:13:41,937 --> 01:13:43,922
That's what I think too.

647
01:13:44,022 --> 01:13:46,341
They just want help, even the scary ones.

648
01:13:46,441 --> 01:13:49,719
And I think I might know
a way to make them go away.

649
01:13:49,819 --> 01:13:51,279
How?

650
01:13:52,405 --> 01:13:55,075
Listen to them.

651
01:13:56,409 --> 01:13:58,728
What if they don't want help?

652
01:13:58,828 --> 01:14:02,190
What if they're just angry
and they just wanna hurt somebody?

653
01:14:02,290 --> 01:14:06,419
- I don't think that's the way it works.
- How do you know for sure?

654
01:14:08,797 --> 01:14:10,799
I don't.

655
01:14:31,528 --> 01:14:33,154
Hey!

656
01:14:34,281 --> 01:14:36,366
Hey! Hey!

657
01:14:56,177 --> 01:14:57,762
What's happening?

658
01:14:59,347 --> 01:15:00,974
What's happening?

659
01:15:03,268 --> 01:15:04,853
Cole.

660
01:15:18,366 --> 01:15:21,144
What's happening to you?

661
01:15:21,244 --> 01:15:24,397
Is someone hurting you?
I'll kick their ass.

662
01:15:24,497 --> 01:15:26,499
Cole, if they're hurting you...

663
01:15:30,045 --> 01:15:32,047
Mom?

664
01:15:40,055 --> 01:15:42,140
Mama, you sleep now.

665
01:17:49,809 --> 01:17:51,811
I'm feeling much better now.

666
01:17:56,816 --> 01:17:59,277
Do you want to tell me something?

667
01:18:35,897 --> 01:18:38,316
She came a long way
to visit me, didn't she?

668
01:18:40,235 --> 01:18:42,320
I guess she did.

669
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:30,952
Can you get some water?

670
01:19:34,915 --> 01:19:36,917
That's her sister.

671
01:19:54,726 --> 01:19:57,854
You know, when I went through this
with my father's cancer, I...

672
01:19:59,189 --> 01:20:02,467
I just can't imagine a child
being in bed for two years.

673
01:20:02,567 --> 01:20:05,095
How many... How many doctors?

674
01:20:05,195 --> 01:20:07,973
- I think it was six.
- Six different doctors?

675
01:20:08,073 --> 01:20:10,075
I think so, yes.

676
01:20:16,414 --> 01:20:19,751
I just heard the, uh,
little one is falling ill now.

677
01:20:20,919 --> 01:20:22,587
God help them.

678
01:20:42,691 --> 01:20:44,276
Don't go home, okay?

679
01:20:45,443 --> 01:20:47,028
I definitely won't.

680
01:22:46,273 --> 01:22:47,941
Mister?

681
01:22:51,653 --> 01:22:53,655
Excuse me, mister.

682
01:22:58,243 --> 01:23:00,245
Are you Kyra's daddy?

683
01:23:14,259 --> 01:23:16,261
It's for you.

684
01:23:18,221 --> 01:23:20,348
She wanted to tell you something.

685
01:23:59,095 --> 01:24:01,723
Oh, no, here he comes.
He's coming my way. Psst!

686
01:24:06,353 --> 01:24:09,256
Would you like to dance?

687
01:24:09,356 --> 01:24:13,176
Um, well, actually,
I just came with my friends.

688
01:24:13,276 --> 01:24:15,762
Oh, well, how about this?

689
01:24:15,862 --> 01:24:17,848
We can dance for a little bit, and...

690
01:24:17,948 --> 01:24:21,451
if you don't like the way I dance,
you can kick me.

691
01:24:22,452 --> 01:24:24,454
Oh, okay, then.

692
01:25:33,398 --> 01:25:35,400
It's time for lunch, Kyra.

693
01:25:40,906 --> 01:25:42,557
I'm feeling much better now.

694
01:25:42,657 --> 01:25:46,077
That's so great, honey.
It's time for your food.

695
01:25:47,996 --> 01:25:50,273
Can I go outside if I eat this?

696
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:54,294
I don't know. You know how you get sick
in the afternoons. We'll see.

697
01:25:57,213 --> 01:26:00,342
Don't say that it tastes funny.
You know I don't like to hear that.

698
01:26:03,803 --> 01:26:05,305
Tami's mom called.

699
01:26:23,448 --> 01:26:25,450
You were keeping her sick.

700
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,762
You liked it, she said.

701
01:26:48,348 --> 01:26:50,350
She looked out for you.

702
01:26:51,685 --> 01:26:53,979
Is Kyra coming back?

703
01:26:57,065 --> 01:26:58,650
Not any more.

704
01:27:07,492 --> 01:27:09,936
Yeah. Got it? That's enough.
That's enough make-up.

705
01:27:10,036 --> 01:27:11,855
Okay.

706
01:27:11,955 --> 01:27:13,940
They're calling for the stable boy.

707
01:27:14,040 --> 01:27:16,126
Oh, we have to hurry.

708
01:27:19,129 --> 01:27:21,631
Who, uh, who were you talkin' to?

709
01:27:28,430 --> 01:27:30,432
Just practising my lines.

710
01:27:34,728 --> 01:27:37,339
Thanks for giving me
this part, Mr Cunningham.

711
01:27:37,439 --> 01:27:41,176
You know, when I went to school here, there was
a terrible fire in this section of the theatre.

712
01:27:41,276 --> 01:27:44,571
- They rebuilt the whole thing.
- Yeah, I know.

713
01:27:56,499 --> 01:28:00,086
Only he who is pure of heart
can take the sword from the stone.

714
01:28:01,463 --> 01:28:03,465
Let the boy try.

715
01:28:11,348 --> 01:28:14,292
But he's a stable boy.
He cleans up after the horses.

716
01:28:14,392 --> 01:28:16,144
Silence, village idiot.

717
01:28:17,771 --> 01:28:19,856
Let the boy step forward.

718
01:28:47,384 --> 01:28:49,803
Hail, King Arthur!

719
01:28:55,767 --> 01:28:59,688
Yea! Hip, hip, hooray!

720
01:29:23,169 --> 01:29:25,238
I thought you were really great
in the play, Cole.

721
01:29:25,338 --> 01:29:27,616
- Really?
- Yeah.

722
01:29:27,716 --> 01:29:30,535
- You know what else?
- What?

723
01:29:30,635 --> 01:29:32,721
I thought Tommy Tammisimo sucked big time.

724
01:29:41,855 --> 01:29:44,190
I got an idea
how you can talk to your wife.

725
01:29:46,067 --> 01:29:48,512
Wait till she's asleep.

726
01:29:48,612 --> 01:29:51,656
Then she'll listen to you,
and she won't even know it.

727
01:29:59,497 --> 01:30:01,499
I'm not gonna see you any more, am I?

728
01:30:04,753 --> 01:30:07,672
I think we said everything
we needed to say.

729
01:30:09,132 --> 01:30:12,177
Maybe it's time to say things
to someone closer to you.

730
01:30:14,095 --> 01:30:16,806
Maybe we can pretend like we're gonna
see each other tomorrow.

731
01:30:19,517 --> 01:30:21,561
Just for pretend.

732
01:30:27,943 --> 01:30:29,486
Okay.

733
01:30:34,699 --> 01:30:36,284
I'm gonna go now.

734
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:45,710
I'll see you tomorrow, Cole.

735
01:31:13,113 --> 01:31:15,198
I'm okay, Officer. I'm okay.

736
01:31:16,449 --> 01:31:18,451
I don't know what happened. I...

737
01:31:27,210 --> 01:31:29,421
Geez, I hope nobody got hurt.

738
01:31:33,508 --> 01:31:35,510
You're very quiet.

739
01:31:36,720 --> 01:31:38,722
You're mad I missed the play, aren't you?

740
01:31:40,181 --> 01:31:44,477
You know, I have two jobs, baby.
You know how important they are for us.

741
01:31:47,606 --> 01:31:49,733
I'd give anything to have been there.

742
01:32:02,037 --> 01:32:04,247
I'm ready to communicate with you now.

743
01:32:09,419 --> 01:32:10,795
"Communicate"?

744
01:32:13,173 --> 01:32:15,216
Tell you my secrets.

745
01:32:17,093 --> 01:32:18,720
What is it?

746
01:32:23,308 --> 01:32:25,310
You know the accident up there?

747
01:32:26,269 --> 01:32:27,854
Yeah.

748
01:32:29,272 --> 01:32:31,258
Someone got hurt.

749
01:32:31,358 --> 01:32:33,426
They did?

750
01:32:33,526 --> 01:32:35,153
A lady.

751
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:38,865
She died.

752
01:32:39,783 --> 01:32:41,868
Oh, my God. What, you can see her?

753
01:32:43,578 --> 01:32:45,105
Yes.

754
01:32:45,205 --> 01:32:46,873
Where is she?

755
01:32:50,126 --> 01:32:52,212
Standing next to my window.

756
01:33:00,178 --> 01:33:01,763
Cole, you're scaring me.

757
01:33:03,265 --> 01:33:05,558
They scare me, too, sometimes.

758
01:33:08,103 --> 01:33:09,479
"They"?

759
01:33:13,441 --> 01:33:15,277
Ghosts.

760
01:33:19,489 --> 01:33:21,157
You see ghosts, Cole?

761
01:33:24,202 --> 01:33:26,329
They want me to do things for them.

762
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:32,127
They... They talk to you?

763
01:33:33,086 --> 01:33:35,297
They tell you to do things?

764
01:33:36,339 --> 01:33:38,425
They're the ones that used to hurt me.

765
01:33:40,802 --> 01:33:42,804
What are you thinking, Mama?

766
01:33:44,389 --> 01:33:48,251
- You think I'm a freak?
- Look at my face.

767
01:33:48,351 --> 01:33:51,354
I would never think that about you, ever.

768
01:33:52,731 --> 01:33:54,858
- Got it?
- Got it.

769
01:34:02,324 --> 01:34:04,492
Just let me think for a minute.

770
01:34:08,330 --> 01:34:10,457
Grandma says hi.

771
01:34:13,919 --> 01:34:16,988
She says she's sorry
for taking the bumblebee pendant.

772
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,132
She just likes it a lot.

773
01:34:22,135 --> 01:34:23,411
What?

774
01:34:23,511 --> 01:34:26,181
Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.

775
01:34:28,475 --> 01:34:31,211
Cole, that's very wrong.

776
01:34:31,311 --> 01:34:33,964
- Grandma's gone. You know that.
- I know.

777
01:34:34,064 --> 01:34:36,466
- She wanted me to tell you...
- Cole, please stop.

778
01:34:36,566 --> 01:34:39,236
She wanted me to tell you
she saw you dance.

779
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:45,308
She said when you were little...

780
01:34:45,408 --> 01:34:47,477
you and her had a fight...

781
01:34:47,577 --> 01:34:50,330
right before your dance recital.

782
01:34:54,209 --> 01:34:57,254
You thought she didn't come
to see you dance.

783
01:35:01,174 --> 01:35:03,176
She did.

784
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:11,142
She hid in the back so you wouldn't see.

785
01:35:12,769 --> 01:35:15,063
She said you were like an angel.

786
01:35:20,527 --> 01:35:22,304
She said...

787
01:35:22,404 --> 01:35:24,906
you came to the place
where they buried her...

788
01:35:28,159 --> 01:35:30,203
asked her a question?

789
01:35:33,039 --> 01:35:35,292
She said the answer is...

790
01:35:37,460 --> 01:35:39,462
every day.

791
01:35:42,007 --> 01:35:44,050
What did you ask?

792
01:35:52,559 --> 01:35:53,935
Do...

793
01:35:55,770 --> 01:35:58,189
Do I make her proud?

794
01:36:02,861 --> 01:36:04,487
Mama.

795
01:36:33,892 --> 01:36:35,335
Hi, everybody.

796
01:36:35,435 --> 01:36:38,880
As most of you know,
I'm not used to doing this...

797
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:42,843
and I promised Anna that I'd try
not to embarrass her.

798
01:36:42,943 --> 01:36:44,945
I'll leave that to her mother.

799
01:36:46,988 --> 01:36:49,141
But we do want to thank
all of you for coming...

800
01:36:49,241 --> 01:36:52,227
and for sharing
this wonderful day with us.

801
01:36:52,327 --> 01:36:54,521
It's, uh, bittersweet, almost, for me...

802
01:36:54,621 --> 01:36:57,399
because I hate giving her up,
but Malcolm's going to be...

803
01:36:57,499 --> 01:36:59,084
Anna?

804
01:37:09,803 --> 01:37:11,429
I miss you.

805
01:37:17,227 --> 01:37:18,812
I miss you too.

806
01:37:20,689 --> 01:37:22,816
Why, Malcolm?

807
01:37:23,942 --> 01:37:25,318
What?

808
01:37:27,404 --> 01:37:31,074
- What is it? What...
- Why did you leave me?

809
01:37:32,075 --> 01:37:34,077
I didn't leave you.

810
01:37:55,181 --> 01:37:57,183
I see people.

811
01:37:59,477 --> 01:38:01,438
They don't know they're dead.

812
01:38:05,525 --> 01:38:07,527
How often do you see them?

813
01:38:08,945 --> 01:38:10,322
All the time.

814
01:38:13,533 --> 01:38:14,910
They're everywhere.

815
01:38:25,712 --> 01:38:27,756
They only see what they wanna see.

816
01:38:34,179 --> 01:38:36,181
Okay, Mikey.

817
01:38:37,766 --> 01:38:40,143
Come on. Give me a minute.

818
01:39:19,182 --> 01:39:21,434
Oh, God! Oh, God, honey.

819
01:39:22,352 --> 01:39:25,188
- Let me see. Let me see.
- It doesn't even hurt.

820
01:39:27,774 --> 01:39:30,969
Let me see. Take your hand off...

821
01:39:31,069 --> 01:39:32,279
Oh, God.

822
01:39:39,703 --> 01:39:41,746
Okay.

823
01:39:43,456 --> 01:39:45,625
No. Oh...

824
01:39:59,097 --> 01:40:01,166
I th... I think I'm okay.

825
01:40:01,266 --> 01:40:04,711
Really, I think it just went...
went in and out.

826
01:40:04,811 --> 01:40:06,271
I...

827
01:40:08,899 --> 01:40:11,026
It doesn't even hurt any more.

828
01:40:41,514 --> 01:40:43,516
I think I can go now.

829
01:40:47,771 --> 01:40:49,856
I just needed to do a couple things.

830
01:40:55,320 --> 01:40:57,364
I needed to help someone.

831
01:41:00,408 --> 01:41:02,410
I think I did.

832
01:41:08,792 --> 01:41:10,877
And I needed to tell you something.

833
01:41:16,258 --> 01:41:18,260
You were never second.

834
01:41:19,636 --> 01:41:21,179
Ever.

835
01:41:24,391 --> 01:41:25,976
I love you.

836
01:41:32,607 --> 01:41:34,609
You sleep now.

837
01:41:36,611 --> 01:41:38,738
Everything'll be different in the morning.

838
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:47,622
Good night, Malcolm.

839
01:41:53,253 --> 01:41:55,338
Good night, sweetheart.

839
01:41:56,305 --> 01:42:56,659
