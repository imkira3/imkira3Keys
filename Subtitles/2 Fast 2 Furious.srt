00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:14,765
Yo, Jimmy. Give me the status.
Tell me we good.

3
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,601
- You got it, man.
- Beautiful.

4
00:01:17,059 --> 00:01:19,812
It's gonna be an all-timer tonight.

5
00:01:23,983 --> 00:01:26,903
All right, fire them up!

6
00:01:27,445 --> 00:01:29,238
We go live in five!

7
00:01:30,239 --> 00:01:33,451
It's time for ignition
and straight automobile pimping.

8
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:07,026
- Girl!
- Sorry! My bad!

9
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:14,492
All right, ladies! We're good.

10
00:02:15,284 --> 00:02:16,619
We're good.

11
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,913
That's it, babies.

12
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,543
Come on, Tej!
Let's get this race going!

13
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:27,338
Wait a second, man.

14
00:02:27,421 --> 00:02:30,174
You cats are first wave.
Where's your fourth at?

15
00:02:53,864 --> 00:02:55,699
Whoa, wait a second.

16
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:59,829
Why don't I find you a fourth
and we settle this on the streets?

17
00:02:59,912 --> 00:03:02,248
- Bring him on.
- Anybody I want?

18
00:03:02,623 --> 00:03:04,625
No matter who it is?

19
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:05,876
Yeah.

20
00:03:11,424 --> 00:03:12,508
Yeah?

21
00:03:12,591 --> 00:03:14,510
Yeah, man. You want to race tonight?

22
00:03:14,593 --> 00:03:17,513
I could use the money.
You got four minutes.

23
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:53,340
All right, girls, let's do this.

24
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:07,313
- You think you'll win, baby?
- What do you think?

25
00:04:08,189 --> 00:04:10,900
- You better. We got rent to pay.
- I know this.

26
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,261
I'll get you when you
get a car worth racing.

27
00:04:48,437 --> 00:04:49,813
There's our fourth.

28
00:04:49,897 --> 00:04:51,607
Shit. It's Brian.

29
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,138
- What's up, Tej?
- What's happening, dude?

30
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:26,266
- Thanks for the invite.
- No problem at all, man.

31
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,852
Just remember me
when you wax, all right?

32
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,855
They got deep pockets?

33
00:05:33,065 --> 00:05:34,191
Real deep.

34
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:39,113
- What's up, Suki?
- What's up, Bullitt?

35
00:05:39,196 --> 00:05:40,948
What do you say we kick it a nickel?

36
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:44,618
Nobody mentioned raising stakes.

37
00:28:42,535 --> 00:28:43,620
Stay.

38
00:28:45,955 --> 00:28:47,999
What's going on here?
Tell me.

39
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,544
Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

40
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:55,089
My red Ferrari was confiscated.

41
00:28:55,173 --> 00:28:57,717
It sits in an impound lot
in Little Haiti.

42
00:28:58,092 --> 00:29:00,094
It's about 20 miles from here.

43
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:04,515
The car isn't important. The package
I left in the glove box is.

44
00:29:04,599 --> 00:29:07,018
The first team back here
with the package...

45
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:09,187
will have an opportunity
to work for me.

46
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,439
What are you saying?
We got to audition?

47
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,650
Nobody has a gun to your head.

48
00:29:16,069 --> 00:29:17,403
That's it.

49
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:20,740
Driver's licenses. Pass them up.

50
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:23,993
Before Christmas, guys.

51
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:28,873
Let's go!

52
00:29:48,643 --> 00:29:49,894
Come on, cuz!

53
00:29:53,147 --> 00:29:54,982
Let's see what this thing can do.

54
00:30:11,666 --> 00:30:14,293
Agent Markham.
They're heading south on I-95.

55
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:15,712
I got it.

56
00:30:16,337 --> 00:30:18,548
They're running. What a surprise.

57
00:30:29,225 --> 00:30:30,768
Stick with me, Rome.
