1
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:13,177
Morning, Scott.
Morning, Wells.

2
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:22,283
Ghost Rider, we have an unknown
aircraft. Vector 090 for bogey.

3
00:04:33,264 --> 00:04:37,428
- Who's up there?
- Cougar, Merlin, Maverick and Goose.

4
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:40,503
Great. Maverick and Goose.

5
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:55,480
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Roger, I got them. 900 knots closure.

6
00:04:55,653 --> 00:04:59,145
- Cougar, you hear that?
- Roger.

7
00:04:59,323 --> 00:05:02,588
- Merlin, you got them?
- I've got radar contact.

8
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:08,221
- I'll get a visual ID. You hook them.
- I'll clean them and fry them.

9
00:05:14,806 --> 00:05:22,508
Ghost Rider, 203. I have them inbound,
bogey heading 270 at 10 miles.

10
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,242
- 900 knots closure.
- Take angels 10, left, 3, 0.

11
00:05:27,418 --> 00:05:30,945
- Are we expecting visitors?
- Negative, sir.

12
00:05:37,895 --> 00:05:42,059
- Merlin, see if he's a single.
- Roger.

13
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:47,865
Do you see a trailer?
Looks like he's a single.

14
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:54,706
- I'm gonna go head-to-head with him.
- Take it easy. I'll see if he's really alone.

15
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:19,436
- He's coming right at us, Mav.
- Okay, buddy. What's on your mind?

16
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:29,304
- Shit, there's two of them. MiG-28s!
- What? What's their position?

17
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:33,348
- 250 miles out, sir.
- Get them out of here!

18
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:40,012
Cougar, you've got MiG one.
I'm going after MiG two.

19
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:46,653
I lost him in the sun! Shit, what's
he doing? You got him, Merlin?

20
00:06:48,699 --> 00:06:51,759
He's coming around on our tail!

21
00:06:51,936 --> 00:06:55,804
Goddamn it. This bogey's all over me.

22
00:06:57,942 --> 00:07:04,370
What's their range now? If they break
150 miles, launch the alert five aircraft.

23
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:11,753
- Airspeed 300. Go get them, Mav!
- I'm going for missile lock.

24
00:07:11,923 --> 00:07:18,692
Let's see if we can scare him
out of here. Lock up, baby.

25
00:07:18,863 --> 00:07:22,731
I've got him locked. Bingo!

26
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:33,567
- We got him, Mav. He's bugging out.
- Mustang, MiG two is headed home.

27
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:37,840
- What's their position?
- 180 miles and bearing 010, sir.

28
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:46,179
- He's got missile lock on us!
- He's engaging me.

29
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:52,393
Goddamn it. Mustang,
this bogey's all over me.

30
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:56,897
- Do I have permission to fire?
- Do not fire until fired upon.

31
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:04,740
- There they are.
- The MiG's in perfect firing position.

32
00:08:04,909 --> 00:08:10,472
- No way. He would have fired by now.
- Maverick, get this asshole off me!

33
00:08:13,184 --> 00:08:19,453
Easy, Cougar. Bring him back,
hard right. Help me engage.

34
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,252
I'm on my way.

35
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:41,076
I can't shoot, so let's have a little fun.

36
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,808
Is this your idea of fun?

37
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:55,555
Greetings.

38
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,520
Watch the birdie.

39
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:02,461
Geez, I crack myself up.

40
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:12,100
Great shot.
I should be a photographer.

41
00:09:12,276 --> 00:09:15,370
Cougar, your tail is clear.
MiG one has bugged out.

42
00:09:26,657 --> 00:09:31,458
Cougar, we've had enough fun
for one day, don't you think?

43
00:09:31,629 --> 00:09:35,463
I'm getting low on fuel,
so we're heading home.

44
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,198
We'll see you on deck.

45
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:51,877
We're running low on gas.

46
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:57,379
Cougar?

47
00:09:57,555 --> 00:10:01,286
We're on vapour.
Let's do it.

48
00:10:03,327 --> 00:10:06,125
Cougar, come on!

49
00:10:14,105 --> 00:10:20,874
- Let's take it back to the ship, man.
- Get him on deck as soon as possible.

50
00:10:23,147 --> 00:10:28,483
Cougar, we've got to land this thing.
We are way low on gas.

51
00:10:28,652 --> 00:10:30,347
Are you all right?

52
00:10:37,027 --> 00:10:41,964
- Maverick, call the ball.
- Roger. Maverick has the ball.

53
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,368
- Cougar's in trouble.
- Come on, we're getting low on gas.

54
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:53,374
- Let's land this sucker.
- Cougar!

55
00:11:00,851 --> 00:11:04,150
- Goddamn it!
- We've got no fuel for this.

56
00:11:04,321 --> 00:11:07,051
We're going after Cougar.

57
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:14,392
- Tell him to land. That's an order!
- You're instructed to land immediately.

58
00:11:19,036 --> 00:11:22,062
Have you boys seen an aircraft carrier?

59
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,576
That MiG really screwed him up.
I don't think he can make it back.

60
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:38,115
You're okay, Cougar. Just stay on
my wing. I'll take you all the way in.

61
00:11:52,736 --> 00:11:57,173
Easy, Cougar.
Just a walk in the park, buddy.

62
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:03,371
You're a little low. You're a little low.
Come on, buddy, pull up.

63
00:12:03,547 --> 00:12:06,175
Pull up, Cougar.

64
00:12:07,651 --> 00:12:11,280
That's it. Almost there.

65
00:12:11,455 --> 00:12:15,516
A little below glide path. Call the ball.

66
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:19,824
Roger ball.

67
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:34,042
You're too low. Increase power!

68
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:48,223
Come in.

69
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:57,633
- What's on your mind?
- My wife and kid, sir.

70
00:12:57,801 --> 00:13:02,670
I almost orphaned him today.
I've never even seen him.

71
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:07,243
- I was so scared.
- We've seen this before.

72
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,936
No, sir.

73
00:13:10,114 --> 00:13:16,212
I'm holding on too tight.
I've lost the edge. I'm sorry, sir.

74
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,858
Cougar?

75
00:13:30,334 --> 00:13:33,929
Thanks, Maverick.

76
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:38,768
- Maverick, Goose, come in here.
- What the hell's going on?

77
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,606
- I don't know.
- Shit.

78
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:50,481
Maverick,
you just did an incredibly brave thing.

79
00:13:52,356 --> 00:13:57,817
What you should have done was land
your plane. It belongs to the taxpayers!

80
00:13:57,995 --> 00:14:01,089
Your ego's writing cheques
your body can't cash.

81
00:14:01,265 --> 00:14:06,066
You've lost your qualifications
as section leader three times.

82
00:14:06,236 --> 00:14:10,605
Put in hack twice by me
with a history of high-speed passes -

83
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:14,801
- over five air control towers
and one admiral's daughter!

84
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:21,578
- Penny Benjamin?
- You, asshole, you're lucky to be here.

85
00:14:21,752 --> 00:14:26,086
Let's not bullshit. Your family name
ain't the best in the Navy.

86
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:30,852
You need to be doing it
better and cleaner than the other guy.

87
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:35,829
- Just want to serve my country, sir.
- Don't screw around with me.

88
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,596
You're a hell of a pilot. Maybe too good.
I'd like to bust your butt -

89
00:14:40,771 --> 00:14:46,903
- but I have another problem here.
I have to send somebody to Miramar.

90
00:14:47,077 --> 00:14:53,016
I've got to do something. I can't believe
it. I have to give you your dream shot.

91
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,780
I have to send you up against the best.
You characters are going to Top Gun.

92
00:15:00,624 --> 00:15:03,991
For five weeks,
you're going to fly against the best.

93
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:09,531
You were number two. Cougar was
number one. He turned in his wings.

94
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:14,865
You guys are number one.
But you remember one thing:

95
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:21,035
You screw up, you'll be flying
a cargo plane full of rubber dog shit.

96
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,237
Yes, sir!

97
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,976
That is all.

98
00:15:28,152 --> 00:15:32,452
Tell me about the MiG some other time.
Gentlemen?

99
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:37,185
- Good luck, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

100
00:16:18,168 --> 00:16:24,073
During Korea, we shot down 12
of their jets for every one of ours.

101
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:31,409
During Vietnam, that ratio fell to 3-1.
Our pilots were dependant on missiles.

102
00:16:31,582 --> 00:16:37,020
Top Gun was created to teach ACM.
Air Combat Manoeuvring. Dogfighting.

103
00:16:37,187 --> 00:16:41,556
- This gives me a hard-on.
- By the end of Vietnam, it was 12-1.

104
00:16:41,725 --> 00:16:44,888
- Don't tease me.
- Blinds, please.

105
00:16:45,062 --> 00:16:50,967
Our commanding officer was the very
first man to win the Top Gun trophy.

106
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:56,402
You won't find a finer fighter pilot
anywhere. Commander Mike Metcalf.

107
00:16:56,573 --> 00:17:00,669
- Call sign, Viper.
- Gentlemen...

108
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:05,178
You're the top one percent
of all naval aviators.

109
00:17:07,251 --> 00:17:12,314
The elite. The best of the best.
We'll make you better.

110
00:17:14,091 --> 00:17:19,654
You fly at least two combat missions
a day, attend classes and evaluations.

111
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:27,066
On each combat sequence you're
gonna meet a different challenge.

112
00:17:27,237 --> 00:17:34,234
We'll teach you to fly the F-14
faster than you've ever flown before.

113
00:17:34,411 --> 00:17:40,680
Now, we don't make policy here.
Elected officials, civilians, do that.

114
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:48,690
We are their instruments and must
always act as though we are at war.

115
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:54,024
- What are you doing?
- Just wondering who's the best.

116
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:59,363
In case some of you wonder
who the best is, they're on this plaque.

117
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:04,564
The best driver and his RIO
from each class has his name on it.

118
00:18:04,741 --> 00:18:10,543
They have the option to come back here
and be Top Gun instructors.

119
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:16,152
- You think you will be on the plaque?
- Yes, sir.

120
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:21,223
That's pretty arrogant,
considering the company you're in.

121
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,425
- Yes, sir.
- I like that in a pilot.

122
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:34,502
Remember, when it's over out there,
we're all on the same team.

123
00:18:35,839 --> 00:18:42,335
This school is about combat.
There are no points for second place.

124
00:18:42,512 --> 00:18:46,175
- Dismissed.
- Nice going.

125
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:53,652
The plaque for the alternates
is down in the ladies' room.

126
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:57,350
Jesus... You kill me.

127
00:18:57,527 --> 00:19:02,624
You really do...
There's two O's in Goose, boys.

128
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:23,175
- This I call a target-rich environment.
- You live your life between your legs.

129
00:19:23,353 --> 00:19:26,413
Even you could get laid in here.

130
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:30,185
I'd be happy to find a girl
who'd talk dirty to me.

131
00:19:33,664 --> 00:19:38,863
You wanted to know who the best is?
That's him. Iceman.

132
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,129
He flies ice-cold. No mistakes.

133
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:49,246
Wears you down. You get bored,
do something stupid, and he's got you.

134
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:56,876
- I thought you wanted to be a pilot.
- Whose butt did you kiss to get here?

135
00:19:57,054 --> 00:20:00,717
- The list is long but distinguished.
- So is my johnson.

136
00:20:00,891 --> 00:20:05,419
- So you're flying with Iceman?
- Hey, Mother Goose, how's it going?

137
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:09,759
Tom, this is Pete Mitchell.
Tom Kazansky.

138
00:20:09,933 --> 00:20:15,997
Congratulations on Top Gun. Sorry to
hear about Cougar. He was a good man.

139
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,974
- Still is a good man.
- Yeah, that's what I meant.

140
00:20:21,144 --> 00:20:27,276
You need any help?
You figured it out yet?

141
00:20:27,451 --> 00:20:32,479
- What's that?
- Who's the best pilot.

142
00:20:32,656 --> 00:20:37,218
- I can figure that one out on my own.
- I heard that about you.

143
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:41,455
You like to work alone.

144
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:46,193
You're lucky. First the MiG
and then you slide into Cougar's spot.

145
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,998
We didn't slide into Cougar's spot.

146
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:54,337
Some pilots wait a whole career to see
a MiG up close. Lucky and famous?

147
00:20:54,511 --> 00:21:01,110
- You mean notorious. See you later.
- You can count on it.

148
00:21:01,284 --> 00:21:06,847
- They were abused children.
- We're gonna have a good time.

149
00:21:10,861 --> 00:21:16,527
Okay, I guess it's my turn, isn't it?
All right, the bet is 20 dollars.

150
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:22,263
You have to have carnal knowledge,
of a lady this time, on the premises.

151
00:21:22,439 --> 00:21:26,739
- On the premises.
- Come on, a bet's a bet.

152
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:33,042
I don't know, it just doesn't seem fair...
for you, I mean. But...

153
00:21:33,216 --> 00:21:36,617
She's lost that loving feeling.

154
00:21:36,787 --> 00:21:40,120
No, she hasn't. She has not lost...

155
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:44,727
- She's lost it, man. Come on.
- I hate it when she does that.

156
00:21:50,834 --> 00:21:55,396
- Excuse me, miss.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of this.

157
00:22:44,187 --> 00:22:47,748
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

158
00:22:55,499 --> 00:23:02,166
I love that song. That's a new approach.
How long have you been doing this act?

159
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,799
- I don't know. Since...
- Puberty?

160
00:23:06,977 --> 00:23:10,504
- I'm Charlotte Blackwood.
- I'm Maverick.

161
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:16,312
- Did your mother not like you?
- No, it's my call sign.

162
00:23:16,486 --> 00:23:21,423
- You're a pilot?
- That's right. A naval aviator.

163
00:23:21,591 --> 00:23:26,927
- Actually, we've only done this twice.
- How did you do?

164
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:31,796
- Crashed and burned on the first one.
- And the second?

165
00:23:31,968 --> 00:23:36,837
I'll tell you tomorrow.
But it's looking good so far.

166
00:23:38,508 --> 00:23:46,176
Well, Maverick. My friend just arrived,
so it's been great talking to you. Perry.

167
00:23:46,349 --> 00:23:50,376
I'll be with you in just a second.

168
00:23:51,421 --> 00:23:57,951
- Can I ask you a personal question?
- That depends.

169
00:23:58,128 --> 00:24:04,158
- Are you a good pilot?
- I can hold my own.

170
00:24:04,334 --> 00:24:11,206
Great. Then I won't have to worry about
you making your living as a singer.

171
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:23,680
I'm gonna need a beer to put these
flames out. Great, Mav. Real slick.

172
00:24:47,577 --> 00:24:51,911
- A long cruise, was it, sailor?
- Too long.

173
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:55,950
You want to just drop down on the tile
and go for it?

174
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,953
I actually had this counter in mind.

175
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:05,891
- That would be very comfortable, yeah.
- It could be.

176
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:14,131
I came in here to save you from making
a big mistake with that older guy.

177
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:20,868
Really? So I could go on to a bigger one
with a young guy like yourself?

178
00:25:21,044 --> 00:25:24,377
Maybe.

179
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:30,081
- I have to get up early in the morning.
- What are you doing?

180
00:25:31,755 --> 00:25:36,158
Your friend was magnificent.

181
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:46,198
You'll also be trained and evaluated
by civilian specialists.

182
00:25:46,369 --> 00:25:51,329
They are our best source of information
on enemy aircraft.

183
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:57,071
One of the most qualified is call sign
Charlie, with a Ph.D. In astrophysics.

184
00:25:57,247 --> 00:26:04,278
Listen to her, because the Pentagon
listens to her about your proficiency.

185
00:26:04,454 --> 00:26:07,981
All yours, Charlie.

186
00:26:08,158 --> 00:26:14,620
Hello. We will be dealing with F-5s
and A-4s as our MiG simulators.

187
00:26:14,798 --> 00:26:20,828
As you know, the F-5 doesn't have
the thrust-to-weight ratio of the MiG-28.

188
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:25,634
And it doesn't bleed energy
below 300 knots like the MiG-28.

189
00:26:25,809 --> 00:26:31,509
However, the MiG-28 does have
a problem with its inverted flight tanks.

190
00:26:31,681 --> 00:26:35,014
It won't do a negative G push-over.

191
00:26:35,185 --> 00:26:40,817
The latest intelligence tells us
the most it will do is...

192
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,551
Excuse me, Lieutenant.
Is there something wrong?

193
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:50,098
- The data on the MiG is inaccurate.
- How's that?

194
00:26:50,266 --> 00:26:55,431
Well, I just happened to see a MiG-28...
Sorry, Goose.

195
00:26:55,605 --> 00:27:01,373
We happened to see a MiG-28
do a four G negative dive.

196
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:04,274
Where did you see this?

197
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:10,716
That's classified. I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

198
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:13,981
I have Top Secret clearance.

199
00:27:14,157 --> 00:27:18,651
The Pentagon sees to it
that I know more than you.

200
00:27:18,828 --> 00:27:26,792
- Well, it doesn't seem to be the case.
- So, where exactly were you?

201
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:33,876
We started up on his six when he pulled
through the clouds. I went above him.

202
00:27:34,043 --> 00:27:38,377
If you were directly above him,
how could you see him?

203
00:27:38,548 --> 00:27:42,348
- Because I was inverted.
- Bullshit.

204
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,011
No, he was, man.
It was a really great move.

205
00:27:46,189 --> 00:27:51,491
You were in a four G inverted dive
with a MiG-28?

206
00:27:51,661 --> 00:27:54,630
- Yes, ma'am.
- At what range?

207
00:27:54,798 --> 00:28:00,703
- About two metres?
- 1 1/2. I have a great Polaroid of it.

208
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:04,306
- It was a nice picture.
- Lieutenant?

209
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:11,774
- What were you doing there?
- Communicating.

210
00:28:11,948 --> 00:28:15,645
Keeping up foreign relations.

211
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:19,880
- I was, you know, giving him the bird.
- You know, the finger.

212
00:28:20,056 --> 00:28:25,756
- I know the finger.
- I hate it when it does that. I'm sorry.

213
00:28:25,929 --> 00:28:29,763
- Excuse me.
- So you're the one?

214
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:34,768
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right, we have a hop to take.

215
00:28:34,938 --> 00:28:40,376
The hard-deck on this is 10,000 feet.
There'll be no engagement below that.

216
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:42,306
Move it!

217
00:28:46,649 --> 00:28:50,050
Lieutenant!

218
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:55,157
Don't be late again.
You look great, honey.

219
00:28:55,325 --> 00:28:59,659
Why didn't you tell me
you were the famous MiG Insulter?

220
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:05,028
- Would it have made any difference?
- Not in the ladies' room.

221
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:12,198
I see 20 new hotshots every eight
weeks. I'm sure you can figure that out.

222
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:18,712
I'd just really like
to hear about the MiG sometime.

223
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:24,115
You've got security clearance.
You can read about it.

224
00:29:28,825 --> 00:29:33,785
Maverick?
I'm curious.

225
00:29:33,963 --> 00:29:40,994
Who was covering Cougar while you
were showboating with his MiG?

226
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:43,502
Cougar was doing just fine.

227
00:29:48,044 --> 00:29:50,877
This is your first hop. The jets you're
flying against are smaller and faster, -

228
00:29:51,047 --> 00:29:56,075
- just like the enemy MiGs.
As of now we are keeping score.

229
00:29:56,252 --> 00:30:00,712
- I lost him, Goose.
- Show me what you've got, kid.

230
00:30:01,991 --> 00:30:05,552
- I lost him.
- I'm looking.

231
00:30:06,996 --> 00:30:11,262
- He's on our tail, coming hard.
- I got him. Here we go.

232
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:29,180
- Talk to me, Goose.
- He's still back there. Closing in on us.

233
00:30:29,352 --> 00:30:33,846
You can run, kid, but you can't hide.

234
00:30:35,825 --> 00:30:40,819
All right, Jester,
I'll give you a run for your money here.

235
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,493
Watch the mountains!

236
00:30:57,046 --> 00:31:02,416
He's still back there. Come on, Mav,
do some of that pilot shit.

237
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:17,255
- Come on, bring it right.
- I've had about enough of this shit.

238
00:31:19,402 --> 00:31:22,565
- I'll hit the brakes, he'll fly right by.
- You're mine.

239
00:31:30,246 --> 00:31:32,271
Jesus Christ!

240
00:31:35,952 --> 00:31:39,683
- Let's see what you've got now, Jester.
- Let's turn and burn.

241
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:02,501
- He's going vertical. So am I.
- We're going ballistic. Go get him!

242
00:32:11,687 --> 00:32:14,986
He's going for the hard-deck.
Let's nail him.

243
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:19,686
No way, Jester. You're mine.

244
00:32:33,976 --> 00:32:36,001
I've got you now!

245
00:32:38,347 --> 00:32:43,410
- Jester's dead.
- Jester's dead.

246
00:32:45,054 --> 00:32:49,354
Get your butts above the hard-deck
and return to base.

247
00:32:52,128 --> 00:32:55,393
Yes, sir!

248
00:33:00,002 --> 00:33:06,430
- This is Ghost Rider requesting a fly-by.
- Negative. The pattern is full.

249
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:12,104
- No, Mav. This is not a good idea.
- Sorry, but it's time to buzz the tower.

250
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:26,360
Goddamn son of a bitch!

251
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:32,424
Great balls of fire.

252
00:33:36,105 --> 00:33:38,938
- Jester's dead.
- You won? Bullshit.

253
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:44,842
- Didn't everybody?
- We got our butts kicked.

254
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:50,281
I said to Hollywood, "Where did he go?"
He said, "Where did who go?"

255
00:33:50,453 --> 00:33:55,618
- And he's laughing at us on the radio.
- That was me, dickhead. We won.

256
00:33:55,791 --> 00:34:00,023
- All right!
- They won too, man.

257
00:34:00,196 --> 00:34:03,962
- That's not what I heard.
- We got Jester.

258
00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:08,661
- Below the hard-deck doesn't count.
- We nailed that son of a bitch.

259
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:13,673
- You guys really are cowboys.
- What's your problem, Kazansky?

260
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:18,473
You're everyone's problem.
Every time you fly, you're unsafe.

261
00:34:18,648 --> 00:34:24,177
- I don't like you. You're dangerous.
- That's right, Iceman.

262
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:28,449
I am dangerous.

263
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,626
Maverick? You and Goose
get your butts up to Viper's office, now!

264
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:42,834
Remember, no points for second place.

265
00:34:43,005 --> 00:34:47,533
- You're a lot brighter than you look.
- You shut up.

266
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:55,583
Two of your snot-nosed jockeys flew by
by at over 400 knots. I want their butts!

267
00:34:57,386 --> 00:35:02,187
Damn it, that's twice.
I want some butts!

268
00:35:02,992 --> 00:35:08,453
- That just about covers the fly-bys.
- Follow me.

269
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:18,296
Gentlemen. You had a hell of a first day.

270
00:35:21,644 --> 00:35:27,412
The hard-deck for this hop was
10,000 feet. You knew it. You broke it.

271
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:34,887
You followed Commander Heatherly
below after he lost sight of you. Why?

272
00:35:35,057 --> 00:35:41,724
Sir, I had him in my sights.
He saw me move in for the kill.

273
00:35:41,897 --> 00:35:48,735
He proceeded below the hard-deck.
We were below for just a few seconds.

274
00:35:48,904 --> 00:35:52,533
I had the shot.
There was no danger, so I took it.

275
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:58,709
You took it,
and broke a major rule of engagement.

276
00:35:58,881 --> 00:36:04,945
Then you broke another one
with that circus stunt fly-by.

277
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:10,081
Top Gun rules of engagement exist
for your safety and for that of your team.

278
00:36:10,259 --> 00:36:16,858
They're not flexible, nor am I. Obey them
or you're history. Is that clear?

279
00:36:19,035 --> 00:36:22,266
Yes, sir!

280
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,940
Dismissed.

281
00:36:36,018 --> 00:36:41,456
I really enjoyed that, Mav,
thanks a lot. Holy shit.

282
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:52,131
Maybe I could be a truck driver. You got
the number of that truck-driving school?

283
00:36:52,301 --> 00:36:57,329
Fitness report says it all.
He's a wild card.

284
00:36:57,506 --> 00:37:01,306
Completely unpredictable.

285
00:37:01,477 --> 00:37:05,743
- He got you, didn't he?
- Yeah.

286
00:37:05,915 --> 00:37:10,852
Maverick. I flew with his old man.

287
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:21,459
Tell me, if you had to go into battle,
would you want him with you?

288
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:25,396
I just don't know.

289
00:37:35,478 --> 00:37:38,675
- Still awake?
- Yeah.

290
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:44,810
- What's up?
- I can't sleep.

291
00:37:46,856 --> 00:37:53,284
When I realised we were off to Top Gun,
all I could think about was that trophy.

292
00:37:53,462 --> 00:37:59,059
I've got to be straight with you, Mav.
Right now, I just hope we graduate.

293
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:06,264
I got a family to think about.
I can't afford to blow this.

294
00:38:08,444 --> 00:38:13,313
I guess that fly-by
wasn't such a big hit, huh?

295
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:21,852
I know it's tough. The Academy rejected
you because you're Duke Mitchell's kid.

296
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:30,261
You have to live with that reputation.
But it's like you're flying against a ghost.

297
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:34,392
It makes me nervous.

298
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:44,008
You're the only family I've got.
I'm not gonna let you down. I promise.

299
00:38:52,755 --> 00:38:57,192
Get out of here.

300
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:15,866
A rolling reversal
would work well in that situation.

301
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:20,038
If I reversed on a hard cross,
I could go to guns on him.

302
00:39:20,216 --> 00:39:25,313
But at that speed, it's too fast.
It's a little bit too aggressive.

303
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:29,948
Too aggressive?

304
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:34,926
I guess when I see something,
I go right after it.

305
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:41,468
- You didn't tell me who you were.
- I didn't get a chance. You deserved it.

306
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:51,205
I know... but you were tempted
to ask me out for dinner.

307
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,079
No. I don't date students.

308
00:40:05,794 --> 00:40:11,596
I can see it's dangerous for you.
But if the government trusts me...

309
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:15,669
...maybe you could.

310
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:24,870
It takes a lot more than just fancy flying.

311
00:40:37,626 --> 00:40:41,960
Crash and burn, huh, Mav?

312
00:40:43,799 --> 00:40:46,393
Slider...

313
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:51,233
You stink.

314
00:40:59,882 --> 00:41:02,009
Let's go!

315
00:42:22,031 --> 00:42:26,525
Come on, Mav. Just one more game.
That evens it up.

316
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:31,139
- I got some things to take care of.
- Just one more game.

317
00:42:31,306 --> 00:42:35,936
Please? For me?
Come on... For me?

318
00:43:10,012 --> 00:43:13,379
Damn it.

319
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:26,695
Lieutenant?

320
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:36,163
- What? No singing?
- Look, I'm...

321
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:39,899
No apologies.

322
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:51,216
If you don't mind, I'll just take a quick
shower while you're finishing up here.

323
00:43:53,222 --> 00:43:57,921
I do mind. I'm hungry.

324
00:44:00,996 --> 00:44:04,762
And then I thought about it.

325
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:09,495
I thought,
"You know, he's a smart guy."

326
00:44:09,671 --> 00:44:15,667
"Why don't you just tell him
why you've got him here?"

327
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,904
It's the MiG.

328
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:29,921
The MiG. You're the only pilot
who's been up against a MiG-28.

329
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:36,823
I'm trying for this big promotion.
If I get it, I won't be here much longer.

330
00:44:36,999 --> 00:44:41,060
Seems to me you've got it all figured out.

331
00:44:42,838 --> 00:44:48,037
Except you did forget the wine.

332
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,610
Sorry.

333
00:44:50,779 --> 00:44:56,240
- You always get what you want?
- No, not always. Yeah, maybe.

334
00:44:56,418 --> 00:45:00,878
Then relax about the MiG.

335
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:17,736
This music...

336
00:45:17,906 --> 00:45:21,342
An old friend?

337
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:27,506
My folks loved it.
I haven't heard this in years.

338
00:45:27,683 --> 00:45:32,814
My mother used to call from her room
and have me play this over and over.

339
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:37,482
I got so sick of it.

340
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:44,258
But not her. She'd sit up there alone,
just listening for hours.

341
00:45:44,433 --> 00:45:50,531
Just listening.
She died shortly after him.

342
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:55,810
What happened to your father?

343
00:45:59,114 --> 00:46:05,883
I figured with your security clearance
you'd know more about it than I do.

344
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:11,424
Well, I didn't get that far.

345
00:46:11,593 --> 00:46:14,926
It's a big mystery.

346
00:46:15,097 --> 00:46:19,898
He disappeared in an F-4,
November 5th, 1965.

347
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:27,740
The stink of it was... he screwed up.

348
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:33,348
No way.
My old man was a great fighter pilot.

349
00:46:36,151 --> 00:46:42,147
But who the hell knows?
It's all classified.

350
00:46:42,324 --> 00:46:46,886
- Somebody must know.
- Yeah, somebody knows everything.

351
00:46:47,062 --> 00:46:52,090
Is that why
you're always second best up there?

352
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:56,761
You are direct, aren't you.

353
00:47:02,744 --> 00:47:06,874
I'm sorry I was late.

354
00:47:07,049 --> 00:47:13,318
- I'm sorry for being direct.
- No apologies.

355
00:47:13,488 --> 00:47:18,755
This is going to be complicated.

356
00:47:28,337 --> 00:47:32,933
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna take a shower.

357
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:42,346
Thank you. I enjoyed being here.

358
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:24,047
It looks like you need another shower.

359
00:48:24,226 --> 00:48:27,718
Right.

360
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:35,364
I'm gonna be honest with you.

361
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:40,702
Your MiG sighting
is really important to my work, but...

362
00:48:44,646 --> 00:48:49,845
I don't normally invite students
to my house. You're...

363
00:48:57,993 --> 00:49:01,622
But please understand,
I still have a job to do.

364
00:49:27,556 --> 00:49:33,119
I'm glad we got that straight.

365
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:53,570
I told her how tough it is here.
My ass dragging like an old tired dog.

366
00:49:53,748 --> 00:49:56,979
I told her you didn't even have a woman.

367
00:49:57,152 --> 00:50:01,088
She said, "He probably
doesn't have one, but eight."

368
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:11,629
- Hi!
- Daddy.

369
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:23,011
Goose tells me you're in love
with one of your instructors.

370
00:50:23,178 --> 00:50:28,639
I didn't tell her that. I can't believe
you said that. That was a secret.

371
00:50:36,057 --> 00:50:41,552
The bogey has good position right here.
Freeze frame. A moment of choice.

372
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:46,099
The F-14 is defensive.
He has a chance to bug out right here.

373
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:52,798
Better to retire and save your aircraft
than push a bad position.

374
00:50:52,974 --> 00:50:58,241
Charlie, jump in here any time. You stay
in that diamond another three seconds, -

375
00:50:58,413 --> 00:51:03,316
- the bogey's gonna blow you away.
You take a hard right, select zone five...

376
00:51:03,485 --> 00:51:08,479
You can extend an escape.
You made a bad choice.

377
00:51:08,657 --> 00:51:15,927
- Charlie?
- Aircraft one performs a split S?

378
00:51:16,097 --> 00:51:20,329
That's the last thing you should do.
The MiG's right on your tail.

379
00:51:20,502 --> 00:51:27,101
Freeze there. The MiG has you in
his gunsight. What were you thinking?

380
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:31,939
You don't have time to think up there.
If you think, you're dead.

381
00:51:32,113 --> 00:51:37,949
That's a big gamble
with a $30 million plane.

382
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:48,360
Unfortunately, it worked.
The MiG never got a clean shot.

383
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:55,299
Maverick makes an aggressive vertical
move and defeats him with a missile.

384
00:51:55,470 --> 00:52:00,908
The encounter was a victory, but we
show it as an example of what not to do.

385
00:52:02,677 --> 00:52:05,077
Next.

386
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:08,774
Gutsiest move I ever saw, man.

387
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:16,714
Now then, this is a perfect example
of a textbook manoeuvre.

388
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,503
Lieutenant?

389
00:52:43,184 --> 00:52:48,212
My review of your performance was
right on, in my professional opinion.

390
00:52:48,390 --> 00:52:52,417
I can't hear you.

391
00:53:10,578 --> 00:53:16,983
Jesus! And you call me reckless? When
I fly, my crew and my plane come first.

392
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:23,819
I'm gonna finish my sentence. My review
of your performance was right on.

393
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:29,726
I see some real genius in your flying,
but I can't say that in there.

394
00:53:29,898 --> 00:53:33,595
I was afraid they'd see right through me.

395
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:39,536
I don't want anyone to know
that I've fallen for you.

396
00:55:24,412 --> 00:55:27,848
- Hey, Maverick? Hear about Ice?
- What's that?

397
00:55:28,016 --> 00:55:32,248
- He won another one.
- Really?

398
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:38,086
I fell the need...
the need for speed.

399
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:46,861
This is hop 19. Multiple aircraft, multiple
bogeys. Your training is half over.

400
00:55:47,035 --> 00:55:51,904
The competition for the trophy
remains tight. First place, Iceman.

401
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:55,406
Second, Maverick, two points behind.

402
00:55:55,577 --> 00:55:59,172
There they are. Three miles, 10 o'clock.

403
00:55:59,347 --> 00:56:04,216
I see them. Two A-4s.
Left 10 o'clock level. Continue left turn.

404
00:56:13,228 --> 00:56:20,964
- Good morning. The temperature is 110.
- Viper's up here? Great. Oh, shit.

405
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:26,471
He's probably saying,
"Holy shit, it's Maverick and Goose."

406
00:56:30,545 --> 00:56:36,313
- I've got my eye on the northern bogey.
- Roger, I've got the southern guy.

407
00:56:36,484 --> 00:56:40,443
Hollywood, you lead. I'll cover you.

408
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:53,599
Break now, Jester.

409
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:00,770
We're losing Viper.
Let's just stay on Jester.

410
00:57:05,146 --> 00:57:12,552
- Goose, find Viper. He's out there.
- Stay with Hollywood.

411
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:17,487
- There's Viper. Three o'clock low.
- We're Hollywood's cover.

412
00:57:17,659 --> 00:57:21,857
- Don't you leave me.
- Hollywood, you're looking good.

413
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,123
I'm going after Viper.

414
00:57:26,634 --> 00:57:29,694
- Goddamn you!
- Don't leave him.

415
00:57:29,871 --> 00:57:33,967
Hollywood's okay. I want Viper.

416
00:57:36,277 --> 00:57:39,178
Viper's coming down.

417
00:57:45,286 --> 00:57:48,813
Holy shit. We're head-to-head.

418
00:58:02,837 --> 00:58:06,329
Rock and roll! Here's our big chance.

419
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:12,106
Come on, goddamn it.

420
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:17,150
Come on, keep coming.

421
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:24,023
Okay, sidewinder missile selected.
Come on, baby.

422
00:58:24,192 --> 00:58:26,990
Come around. That's it.

423
00:58:32,934 --> 00:58:40,602
- Jesus, he's good. Where's he going?
- Come on, come on. Keep coming.

424
00:58:43,411 --> 00:58:47,040
Come on, baby.

425
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:53,085
Damn, this kid's good.

426
00:58:53,254 --> 00:58:56,917
He's too close for missiles.
I'm switching to guns.

427
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:02,496
Come on, come on.

428
00:59:03,231 --> 00:59:06,257
Stick with it...

429
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:13,267
- Hold it. Check our tail.
- Shit, there's Jester!

430
00:59:13,441 --> 00:59:18,344
Bingo, Maverick's dead.
You're out of there, kid.

431
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:25,681
The Defence Department regrets to
inform you your sons died of stupidity.

432
00:59:25,853 --> 00:59:29,914
Knock it off, gentlemen.
Let's go home. Viper has the lead.

433
00:59:36,531 --> 00:59:40,729
- 30 seconds, Wolfman. I'm coming in.
- Shut up!

434
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:46,671
That was some of the best flying
I've seen yet. Until you got killed.

435
00:59:46,841 --> 00:59:51,574
You never, never leave your wingman.

436
00:59:56,551 --> 01:00:02,547
Maverick... It's not your flying,
it's your attitude.

437
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:11,257
The enemy's dangerous, but right now
you're worse. Dangerous and foolish.

438
01:00:11,432 --> 01:00:18,565
You may not like who's flying with you,
but whose side are you on?

439
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:32,710
At least Viper got Iceman before
he got us. We've still got a shot at it.

440
01:00:32,887 --> 01:00:39,053
That was stupid, I know better than that.
That will never happen again.

441
01:00:41,796 --> 01:00:45,197
I know...

442
01:00:48,469 --> 01:00:52,235
I know.

443
01:01:40,254 --> 01:01:44,588
Go fetch him.
Doesn't he ever embarrass you?

444
01:01:44,759 --> 01:01:51,028
- Hell no. Well, there was the time...
- Admiral's daughter.

445
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:56,364
He told me all about the time
you went ballistic with Penny Benjamin.

446
01:01:56,537 --> 01:01:59,097
Did he? Great.

447
01:01:59,207 --> 01:02:04,736
He tells me about all of them. My angel
Goose goes home early for church.

448
01:02:04,912 --> 01:02:09,542
- You go home with the hot women.
- Thank you, Carole.

449
01:02:09,717 --> 01:02:15,155
I'm gonna go embarrass myself
with Goose for a while.

450
01:02:30,438 --> 01:02:36,434
I'd love to be able to warn you off about
Maverick, but I just love him to death.

451
01:02:37,578 --> 01:02:42,675
I've known Pete for a lot of years.
One thing's for certain.

452
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:48,254
There are hearts breaking wide open
all over the world tonight.

453
01:02:48,422 --> 01:02:52,882
Unless you are a fool,
that boy is off the market.

454
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:58,464
He is 100% prime time in love with you.

455
01:02:58,633 --> 01:03:04,367
Hey, Goose, you big stud.
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

456
01:03:04,538 --> 01:03:08,235
Show me the way home, honey.

457
01:03:08,409 --> 01:03:11,310
Come on, brother, sing with the family.

458
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:47,572
Maverick, you big stud...

459
01:03:47,748 --> 01:03:52,185
Take me to bed or lose me forever.

460
01:04:04,699 --> 01:04:07,793
This is hop 31.
Two weeks to graduation.

461
01:04:07,969 --> 01:04:11,803
The Top Gun trophy
is still up for grabs.

462
01:04:55,149 --> 01:04:58,846
The score is tied. Time for the big one.

463
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:05,152
- Are you up for this one, Maverick?
- Just a walk in the park.

464
01:05:06,994 --> 01:05:11,761
Contact. Multiple bogeys. Two miles.
Looks like they're going away from us.

465
01:05:11,932 --> 01:05:15,959
- I see them. Right, two o'clock. I'm in.
- I'm in.

466
01:05:35,990 --> 01:05:39,585
That son of a bitch cut me off.

467
01:05:46,467 --> 01:05:52,463
Come on. Jesus Christ, Ice.
Take the shot. Get the hell out of there.

468
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:56,508
I can't get the angle. I'm too close.
I'm switching to guns.

469
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:59,874
Fire or clear!

470
01:06:04,385 --> 01:06:10,483
- Christ, I can take a shot right here.
- 20 seconds and I've got him.

471
01:06:16,397 --> 01:06:20,561
- I'm moving in. I've got the shot.
- Come on, Mav.

472
01:06:22,203 --> 01:06:25,900
- He's getting impatient. Take the shot.
- 10 more seconds.

473
01:06:27,942 --> 01:06:32,743
Get the hell out of there.
Come off my right. I'm in.

474
01:06:32,913 --> 01:06:35,905
- Five more seconds.
- I'm in.

475
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:38,779
I'm off. Shit.

476
01:06:40,788 --> 01:06:43,586
We're in a jetwash. Shit!

477
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:52,532
This is not good. We've got a flame-out.
Engine one is out... Engine two is out.

478
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,794
I'm losing control. I can't control it!

479
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:03,842
It's coupling up. This is not good!

480
01:07:04,011 --> 01:07:09,540
Mayday, mayday. Mav's in trouble.
He's in a flat spin heading out to sea!

481
01:07:11,352 --> 01:07:14,947
Altitude 8,000... 7,000...

482
01:07:15,122 --> 01:07:17,955
We're at 6,000!

483
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:22,656
I can't reach the ejection handle!

484
01:07:24,732 --> 01:07:30,728
- You're gonna have to punch us out.
- I can't reach the ejection handle!

485
01:07:30,905 --> 01:07:35,239
- Eject...
- Watch the canopy!

486
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:54,217
Goose... Oh, no!

487
01:07:57,765 --> 01:08:00,529
Oh, God.

488
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:51,411
Sir, let go of him.
You've got to let him go, sir.

489
01:09:34,662 --> 01:09:40,532
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.

490
01:09:40,701 --> 01:09:44,831
- Goose is dead.
- I know.

491
01:09:47,875 --> 01:09:52,608
You fly jets long enough,
something like this happens.

492
01:09:52,780 --> 01:09:57,183
He was my RIO, my responsibility.

493
01:09:59,253 --> 01:10:05,249
In my squadron in Vietnam,
we lost 8 of 18 aircraft. 10 men.

494
01:10:05,459 --> 01:10:11,796
The first one dies, you die too.
But there will be others.

495
01:10:11,965 --> 01:10:15,492
You can count on it.

496
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:19,503
You've got to let him go.

497
01:10:20,674 --> 01:10:24,474
You've got to let him go.

498
01:10:40,494 --> 01:10:44,624
I think maybe it was my fault.

499
01:10:44,798 --> 01:10:48,199
I don't know.

500
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:52,328
I don't know what the hell went wrong.

501
01:10:52,506 --> 01:10:57,569
I'd like to help. I know it's difficult.

502
01:11:03,083 --> 01:11:07,247
God, I want him back.

503
01:11:11,392 --> 01:11:15,988
I'll be here if you need me, okay?

504
01:13:07,207 --> 01:13:11,200
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

505
01:13:28,428 --> 01:13:34,162
He would have flown anyway...
without you.

506
01:13:34,334 --> 01:13:39,966
He'd have hated it,
but he would have done it.

507
01:13:59,092 --> 01:14:05,520
The spin was induced by the disruption
of air flow into the starboard engine.

508
01:14:05,699 --> 01:14:09,692
This disruption stalled the engine, -

509
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:14,364
- which produced enough yaw rate
to induce a spin -

510
01:14:14,541 --> 01:14:17,977
- which was unrecoverable.

511
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:23,777
There was no way Lieutenant Mitchell
could see or avoid the jetwash.

512
01:14:23,951 --> 01:14:29,116
The Board of Inquiry finds that he was
not at fault in the accident of 29 July.

513
01:14:29,289 --> 01:14:36,058
His record will be cleared. He's restored
to flight status without further delay.

514
01:14:37,130 --> 01:14:40,657
These proceedings are closed.

515
01:14:48,108 --> 01:14:51,635
Get him up flying, soon.

516
01:15:17,104 --> 01:15:22,940
- Come on, kid. Get in there. Engage.
- You've got a bogey at two o'clock.

517
01:15:27,414 --> 01:15:31,043
Take the shot, kid.

518
01:15:31,218 --> 01:15:34,779
You can engage any time, Maverick.

519
01:15:43,263 --> 01:15:48,030
- Where the hell are you going?
- It doesn't look good.

520
01:15:48,201 --> 01:15:53,571
What do you mean? It doesn't get
to look any better than that.

521
01:16:04,084 --> 01:16:08,214
Hey, man. We could have had him...

522
01:16:10,323 --> 01:16:16,057
I'll fire when I'm goddamn
good and ready. You got that?

523
01:16:33,814 --> 01:16:39,150
- He won't engage.
- It's only been a few days.

524
01:16:39,319 --> 01:16:45,781
- He just might not make it back.
- Keep sending him up.

525
01:17:05,946 --> 01:17:08,676
Mitchell?

526
01:17:08,849 --> 01:17:13,343
I'm sorry about Goose.

527
01:17:14,621 --> 01:17:18,182
Everybody liked him.

528
01:17:22,095 --> 01:17:25,531
I'm sorry.

529
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:47,550
Hi, it's Wolfman.

530
01:17:47,721 --> 01:17:49,655
Maverick just quit.

531
01:18:12,879 --> 01:18:16,042
Excuse me...

532
01:18:17,384 --> 01:18:20,319
- May I?
- Please.

533
01:18:29,329 --> 01:18:34,824
I'll have what he's having.
Hemlock, is it?

534
01:18:35,001 --> 01:18:39,665
Ice water.

535
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:45,300
You weren't gonna say goodbye?

536
01:18:45,478 --> 01:18:50,347
I heard you got that job in Washington.
Congratulations.

537
01:18:50,517 --> 01:18:57,389
Thanks. But I wasn't gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

538
01:19:01,194 --> 01:19:05,790
- It's good to see you.
- Thanks.

539
01:19:07,367 --> 01:19:13,636
Where are you going?
You don't even have a ticket, do you?

540
01:19:13,807 --> 01:19:20,975
I've seen all the evidence, and it's not
your responsibility. It's not your fault.

541
01:19:22,048 --> 01:19:25,882
You're one of the best pilots in the Navy.

542
01:19:26,052 --> 01:19:30,546
What you do up there... It's dangerous.

543
01:19:30,724 --> 01:19:35,684
- But you've got to go on.
- You don't understand.

544
01:19:36,863 --> 01:19:42,324
When I first met you,
you were larger than life.

545
01:19:44,170 --> 01:19:47,162
Look at you.

546
01:19:47,340 --> 01:19:52,471
You're not gonna be happy unless you're
going Mach 2 with your hair on fire.

547
01:19:52,646 --> 01:19:55,581
No, that's over. It's just over.

548
01:19:55,749 --> 01:20:02,086
To be the best of the best means you
make mistakes and then you go on.

549
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:06,089
You don't think I know that?

550
01:20:06,259 --> 01:20:09,490
I'm here to help.

551
01:20:09,663 --> 01:20:17,627
Look, thank you. If I'd wanted help,
I would have asked for it.

552
01:20:23,777 --> 01:20:27,611
So, I'm too late.

553
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:31,444
You've already left.

554
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:38,649
You didn't learn a damn thing, did you?
Except to quit.

555
01:20:40,160 --> 01:20:45,097
You've got that manoeuvre down
real well.

556
01:20:50,570 --> 01:20:54,028
So long, Pete Mitchell.

557
01:21:18,631 --> 01:21:24,866
Hi, Maverick, come on in. How are you?
Sure you're feeling okay?

558
01:21:25,038 --> 01:21:29,566
- Great.
- Jamie, come on. Can I get you a drink?

559
01:21:29,743 --> 01:21:34,806
Make yourself comfortable.
Mike will be right down.

560
01:21:54,134 --> 01:22:00,073
I flew with your old man.
VF-51, the Oriskany.

561
01:22:01,408 --> 01:22:08,007
You're a lot like he was.
Only better... and worse.

562
01:22:09,949 --> 01:22:14,079
He was a natural heroic son of a bitch.

563
01:22:17,557 --> 01:22:21,550
So he did do it right.

564
01:22:23,596 --> 01:22:27,896
Yeah, he did it right.

565
01:22:35,742 --> 01:22:40,907
Is that why you fly the way you do?
Trying to prove something?

566
01:22:42,282 --> 01:22:46,082
Yeah, your old man did it right.

567
01:22:46,252 --> 01:22:50,450
What I'm about to tell you is classified.
It could end my career.

568
01:22:50,623 --> 01:22:53,888
We were in the worst dogfight ever.

569
01:22:54,060 --> 01:23:00,056
Bogeys like fireflies all over the sky.
His F-4 was hit, -

570
01:23:00,233 --> 01:23:03,259
- he was wounded, but he stayed.

571
01:23:03,436 --> 01:23:10,171
- Saved three planes before he bought it.
- How come I never heard that before?

572
01:23:10,343 --> 01:23:17,408
The battle occurred
over the wrong line on some map.

573
01:23:17,584 --> 01:23:21,418
- So you were there?
- I was there.

574
01:23:21,588 --> 01:23:27,959
- What's on your mind?
- My options, sir.

575
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:32,588
Simple.
You've acquired enough points -

576
01:23:32,765 --> 01:23:37,964
- to show up tomorrow and graduate
with your class. Or you could quit.

577
01:23:39,973 --> 01:23:44,273
There'll be no disgrace.
That spin was hell.

578
01:23:44,444 --> 01:23:49,313
- So you think I should quit?
- I didn't say that.

579
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:54,647
You feel responsible for Goose.
And you have a confidence problem.

580
01:23:56,389 --> 01:23:59,722
I won't blow sunshine up your ass.

581
01:23:59,893 --> 01:24:04,262
A good pilot is compelled
to evaluate what's happened -

582
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:12,360
- and apply what he's learned. Up there,
we've got to push it. That's our job.

583
01:24:15,074 --> 01:24:19,602
It's your option, Lieutenant.
All yours.

584
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:34,783
Sorry to bother you on a Sunday, sir.
Thank you for your time.

585
01:24:34,961 --> 01:24:38,897
No problem. Good luck.

586
01:25:26,613 --> 01:25:31,107
- Gentlemen...
- Where's Maverick?

587
01:25:31,284 --> 01:25:37,018
- I don't know where he is.
- You know what he's planning to do?

588
01:25:38,091 --> 01:25:43,085
It's got to be hard on the guy though.

589
01:26:11,991 --> 01:26:15,427
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

590
01:26:16,496 --> 01:26:20,262
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Mav.

591
01:26:22,769 --> 01:26:29,265
Gentlemen, I hate to break up the party
before it gets out of hand...

592
01:26:29,442 --> 01:26:34,607
Some of you have to depart
immediately. We have a crisis situation.

593
01:26:34,781 --> 01:26:38,649
Ice, Slider...
Hollywood, Wolfman.

594
01:26:40,887 --> 01:26:45,449
- Maverick.
- Sir.

595
01:26:47,026 --> 01:26:52,589
Maverick, you'll get your RIO
when you get to the ship. If you don't...

596
01:26:52,765 --> 01:26:56,326
...give me a call. I'll fly with you.

597
01:27:11,150 --> 01:27:16,816
The SS Layton has become disabled
and has wandered into foreign territory.

598
01:27:16,989 --> 01:27:22,825
A rescue operation will soon begin.
Your mission is to give it air support.

599
01:27:22,995 --> 01:27:29,867
There are MiGs in the area. If you
witness a hostile act, return fire.

600
01:27:30,937 --> 01:27:36,534
They carry the Exocet anti-ship missile.
They can fire it from 100 miles away.

601
01:27:36,709 --> 01:27:43,012
This is the real thing.
This is what you've been trained for.

602
01:27:43,182 --> 01:27:48,176
Make us proud.
Ice... Hollywood, sector two.

603
01:27:48,354 --> 01:27:52,586
Maverick, you back them up with Merlin
on ready five.

604
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:56,024
- Yes, sir.
- Rise.

605
01:27:57,964 --> 01:28:01,058
Excuse me, sir. This is not personal.

606
01:28:01,234 --> 01:28:07,298
- But is Maverick the best pilot to?
- I know what's on your mind. Get on it.

607
01:29:26,219 --> 01:29:29,677
You've got a pair of bogeys,
12 o'clock, 15 miles.

608
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:35,658
Voodoo One, 090, radar contact
15 miles. They're doing 500 knots.

609
01:29:35,828 --> 01:29:38,729
Roger, that's your bogey.

610
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,398
Dead ahead, 15 miles, 600 knots.

611
01:29:52,278 --> 01:29:56,339
They're at 15,000 feet now, 10 miles.

612
01:29:56,516 --> 01:30:00,816
800 knots. Dead ahead now, eight miles.

613
01:30:00,987 --> 01:30:05,424
Wood, you got them? They must
be close. I'm getting a hard-on.

614
01:30:12,665 --> 01:30:19,901
- I'm taking the lead. Let's identify them.
- Roger. I'm on your left side, a little low.

615
01:30:20,072 --> 01:30:23,064
Maverick's up and ready in alert five.

616
01:30:25,811 --> 01:30:30,612
My bogey's still locked up.
He's drifting to the left.

617
01:30:30,783 --> 01:30:37,086
- Still manoeuvring, course 090.
- Let's bring it to the right.

618
01:30:46,766 --> 01:30:52,068
Ice, we've got a problem. I have four
aircraft on radar. Four bogeys.

619
01:30:52,238 --> 01:30:55,105
Wood, we've got four bogeys.

620
01:30:56,709 --> 01:31:00,873
- Wrong, make that five!
- There's five, sir.

621
01:31:02,982 --> 01:31:06,315
- Oh, shit!
- He's got a radar lock on us.

622
01:31:08,688 --> 01:31:12,920
Get out of there, Hollywood!

623
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:25,727
I'm hit. We're coming apart.
I can't control it! We're going down.

624
01:31:25,905 --> 01:31:28,897
Wood's been hit. Wood's been hit!

625
01:31:29,075 --> 01:31:32,408
Voodoo One, Wood's been hit.
We've lost Hollywood!

626
01:31:32,578 --> 01:31:35,809
- We've lost Hollywood.
- Launch Maverick.

627
01:31:35,982 --> 01:31:41,113
Get a bearing on Hollywood and
Wolfman. Launch the rescue helicopter.

628
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:11,442
- Iceman, what's your position?
- 090 at 180 miles.

629
01:32:11,617 --> 01:32:16,213
- They're coming in left.
- Three MiGs dead ahead.

630
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:23,159
I'm going after them.
I'm bringing it around to the left.

631
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:27,823
We have four on our tail.
That makes six of them!

632
01:32:32,238 --> 01:32:38,234
- He's firing. Break right.
- This is Voodoo One. We are defensive.

633
01:32:38,411 --> 01:32:43,041
- Launch the alert fighters!
- 160 miles and closing in fast, sir.

634
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:44,978
Ready Willard and Simkin.

635
01:32:47,987 --> 01:32:53,721
- I'll be there in 30 seconds.
- I'm engaged with five. I'm in deep shit.

636
01:32:56,429 --> 01:33:01,628
- Willard and Simkin?
- We can't launch any aircraft yet, sir.

637
01:33:01,801 --> 01:33:06,238
How long? 10 minutes?
It's over in two minutes!

638
01:33:08,774 --> 01:33:12,870
One MiG 12 o'clock high...
Watch your back!

639
01:33:18,718 --> 01:33:23,382
- Break right!
- Shit, that was close.

640
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:27,253
- Maverick, get your butt down here!
- Hang in there.

641
01:33:29,361 --> 01:33:32,956
Jesus Christ!

642
01:33:33,132 --> 01:33:37,296
How about some help? Engage!

643
01:33:37,470 --> 01:33:41,406
We've got a MiG on our tail.

644
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:44,975
Watch out!

645
01:33:46,345 --> 01:33:50,714
We just flew right through his jetwash!

646
01:33:50,883 --> 01:33:53,750
Get control!

647
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:05,926
- Good recovery.
- Let's get in there and help Ice.

648
01:34:06,098 --> 01:34:10,899
- Let's get back in the game.
- No, it's no good.

649
01:34:13,839 --> 01:34:19,004
- Goddamn it. Maverick's disengaging.
- I knew it. Shit!

650
01:34:22,181 --> 01:34:27,778
Get in there, come on.
What the hell are you doing?

651
01:34:27,953 --> 01:34:33,823
- Ice won't last down there alone...
- Talk to me, Goose.

652
01:34:33,993 --> 01:34:37,622
Maverick!

653
01:34:39,532 --> 01:34:42,194
Maverick's re-engaging, sir.

654
01:34:46,972 --> 01:34:51,602
- I can't get him off my tail.
- I've got your MiG dead ahead.

655
01:34:53,078 --> 01:34:56,878
I got tone. Firing!

656
01:35:07,293 --> 01:35:10,729
- Where are they?
- 155 miles.

657
01:35:10,896 --> 01:35:16,300
- Two MiGs dead ahead.
- I see them. I'll take it left.

658
01:35:17,403 --> 01:35:19,735
Oh, my God.

659
01:35:22,074 --> 01:35:26,841
Ice is right below with a MiG on his tail.

660
01:35:27,012 --> 01:35:29,708
He's firing. Break left!

661
01:35:31,951 --> 01:35:34,920
He overshot!

662
01:35:35,087 --> 01:35:40,582
Coming in, Ice.
I got two MiGs, dead ahead.

663
01:35:42,361 --> 01:35:45,159
One MiG passing between us.

664
01:35:48,434 --> 01:35:52,336
You've got a MiG on your left.
He's gonna fire!

665
01:36:00,212 --> 01:36:03,306
Check the guy to the north!

666
01:36:05,651 --> 01:36:08,882
Banking left.

667
01:36:10,089 --> 01:36:15,721
- There he is. Get him, Ice!
- Okay, you guys, I'm coming in.

668
01:36:19,031 --> 01:36:23,195
- A MiG's coming round on our tail.
- I can't leave Ice.

669
01:36:23,369 --> 01:36:28,238
- He's gonna get behind us!
- I'm not leaving my wingman.

670
01:36:31,010 --> 01:36:36,038
I'm on his tail. I'm going
for the shot right now. Roger, engaged!

671
01:36:39,051 --> 01:36:43,545
- I've got radar lock.
- I'm taking the shot. Fire!

672
01:36:48,327 --> 01:36:51,922
- Bingo!
- Watch out, there's a MiG to your right.

673
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:54,930
He's firing!

674
01:36:55,100 --> 01:37:01,369
- I'm hit. We're hit in the right engine.
- I'm shutting it down.

675
01:37:06,245 --> 01:37:09,772
Coming in, Ice.

676
01:37:11,617 --> 01:37:16,486
That bogey's still behind you.
I'm manoeuvring for a shot.

677
01:37:16,655 --> 01:37:19,749
- Take the shot.
- I can't get a tone.

678
01:37:19,925 --> 01:37:23,224
Shoot. I can't get him off my tail.

679
01:37:26,632 --> 01:37:30,159
- We're hit again.
- We're okay.

680
01:37:30,336 --> 01:37:33,203
On the count of three, break hard right.

681
01:37:33,372 --> 01:37:37,775
Three... two... one... break right!

682
01:37:40,212 --> 01:37:43,511
Firing!

683
01:37:45,751 --> 01:37:49,380
- Damn it, I missed.
- Don't let him go.

684
01:37:49,555 --> 01:37:53,651
I got him. Here comes the shot.

685
01:37:59,665 --> 01:38:02,828
Strike three.

686
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:07,837
- There's a MiG on your tail.
- We've only got one missile left.

687
01:38:08,007 --> 01:38:10,874
110 miles, sir.

688
01:38:11,043 --> 01:38:13,807
I got him. He's on our tail.

689
01:38:21,153 --> 01:38:25,146
He's still with us.

690
01:38:27,459 --> 01:38:32,419
- You're slowing down.
- I'm bringing him in closer.

691
01:38:37,703 --> 01:38:42,333
- This is it.
- I'll hit the brakes. He'll fly right by us.

692
01:38:46,178 --> 01:38:48,578
Now!

693
01:38:52,484 --> 01:38:55,112
I've got a good lock. Firing.

694
01:38:58,724 --> 01:39:01,192
Strike four!

695
01:39:04,797 --> 01:39:10,258
This is Voodoo Three.
Remaining MiGs are bugging out.

696
01:39:23,515 --> 01:39:29,215
- This is Maverick, requesting fly-by.
- Negative, the pattern is full.

697
01:39:31,824 --> 01:39:34,793
Is there something I should know about?

698
01:39:53,245 --> 01:39:56,009
Goddamn that guy.

699
01:40:50,836 --> 01:40:53,999
You!

700
01:40:55,274 --> 01:40:59,267
You are still dangerous.

701
01:41:01,346 --> 01:41:04,782
But you can be my wingman anytime.

702
01:41:04,950 --> 01:41:09,853
Bullshit. You can be mine.

703
01:42:00,072 --> 01:42:05,374
Maverick? You're on the front pages
of all the English-speaking world.

704
01:42:05,544 --> 01:42:09,537
Even though the other side
denies the incident, congratulations.

705
01:42:09,715 --> 01:42:16,211
They gave you your choice of duty, son.
Where do you think you want to go?

706
01:42:16,388 --> 01:42:20,984
- I thought of being an instructor, sir.
- Top Gun?

707
01:42:21,159 --> 01:42:24,788
- Yes, sir.
- God help us.

708
01:43:45,177 --> 01:43:48,237
Hello, Pete Mitchell.

709
01:43:51,350 --> 01:43:57,084
I heard the best of the best
were gonna be back here, so...

710
01:44:00,759 --> 01:44:04,217
This could be complicated.

711
01:44:04,396 --> 01:44:08,696
You know,
on the first one, I crashed and burned.

712
01:44:08,867 --> 01:44:13,031
And the second?

713
01:44:18,610 --> 01:44:22,876
I don't know.

714
01:44:22,948 --> 01:44:27,214
But it's looking good so far.

715
01:49:21,312 --> 01:49:26,301
