1
00:01:34,573 --> 00:01:36,741
Tina.

2
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,707
Tina.

3
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:50,714
Tina.

4
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:48,190
Tina. Tina.

5
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:41,394
You okay, Tina?

6
00:03:42,395 --> 00:03:44,023
Just a dream, Ma.

7
00:03:45,274 --> 00:03:47,026
Some dream, judging from that.

8
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:57,120
- You coming back to the sack or what?
- Hold your horses.

9
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,918
Tina, honey, you gotta cut your fingernails

10
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:05,087
or you gotta stop that kind of dreaming.

11
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:06,922
One or the other.

12
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:21,701
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

13
00:04:21,868 --> 00:04:26,707
Three, four
Better lock your door

14
00:04:26,874 --> 00:04:31,628
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

15
00:04:31,796 --> 00:04:36,300
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

16
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:39,845
Nine, 10
Never sleep again

17
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,972
It was so scary.

18
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:45,225
When I woke up, it seemed like he was
still in the room.

19
00:04:45,393 --> 00:04:49,104
Sounds like a real boogeyman.
"One, two, Freddy's coming for you. "

20
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,232
That's what it reminded me of:
that old jump-rope song.

21
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,943
The worst nightmare I ever had.
You wouldn't believe it.

22
00:04:55,111 --> 00:04:57,612
Matter of fact,
I had a bad dream last night myself.

23
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,282
I had a hard-on this morning
when I woke up, Tina.

24
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:03,910
- Had your name written all over it.
- There's four letters in my name, Rod.

25
00:05:04,078 --> 00:05:06,246
How could there be room
on your joint for four letters?

26
00:05:07,582 --> 00:05:10,250
Hey, up yours
with a twirling lawn mower.

27
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:12,252
Nyah! Rod says the sweetest things.

28
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,171
- Oh, he's nuts about you.
- Yeah, nuts.

29
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:17,925
Anyway, I couldn't go
back to sleep last night.

30
00:05:18,969 --> 00:05:21,095
- So, what did you dream?
- Forget it, Tina.

31
00:05:21,263 --> 00:05:23,973
The point is that everyone
has a bad dream once in a while.

32
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:25,433
It's no biggie.

33
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:28,436
Just tell yourself that's all it is
while you're having it.

34
00:05:28,604 --> 00:05:33,107
Once you do that, you wake right up.
At least it works for me.

35
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:38,404
Hey! Did you have a nightmare too?

36
00:05:42,576 --> 00:05:47,955
Maybe we're gonna have a big earthquake.
They say things get really weird just before.

37
00:05:54,296 --> 00:05:56,381
I'm so glad you guys
could come over tonight.

38
00:05:56,548 --> 00:05:59,342
When Mom said she was taking off
for two days, I almost died.

39
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,303
No problem, Tina.
Nancy and Glen to the rescue.

40
00:06:03,806 --> 00:06:06,140
Can't believe his mother's letting him
spend the night.

41
00:06:06,308 --> 00:06:10,353
Right, well, she's not, exactly.

42
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:14,483
I got this cousin who lives near the airport.
It's okay for me to stay with him.

43
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:17,027
And I got this sound-effects tape
from Rod, and...

44
00:06:17,195 --> 00:06:19,071
Hello, Mom?

45
00:06:19,989 --> 00:06:22,783
Yeah. Out here at Barry's.

46
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,123
Huh? Yeah, noisy as usual.
Glad we don't live here, huh?

47
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:32,584
Yeah, Aunt Eunice says hello.

48
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,588
Right, right, I'll call you in the morning.
Yeah. Yeah, sure...

49
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:42,010
Just some kids drag-racing outside,
I think, Mom.

50
00:06:44,806 --> 00:06:47,057
Listen, Ma. I gotta go.
I think there's been an accident out front.

51
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,352
Right.

52
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,398
All right, I'll call the police.

53
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:57,693
Right, I'll call the police.

54
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,697
No. Just some neighbors
having a fight, I guess.

55
00:07:01,865 --> 00:07:04,032
I'll call you in the morning.

56
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,459
It worked like a charm.

57
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:13,877
Smooth.

58
00:07:14,044 --> 00:07:15,086
Jesus.

59
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:19,549
See? I told you you'd be feeling better.

60
00:07:20,885 --> 00:07:24,721
All day long,
I've been seeing that guy's weird face...

61
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:26,848
...and hearing those fingernails.

62
00:07:27,266 --> 00:07:29,309
Fingernails?

63
00:07:29,477 --> 00:07:31,227
That's amazing, you saying that.

64
00:07:31,395 --> 00:07:34,731
That made me remember
the dream I had last night.

65
00:07:34,899 --> 00:07:36,399
What did you dream?

66
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:40,403
I dreamed about a guy
in a dirty red and green sweater.

67
00:07:42,031 --> 00:07:44,491
Well, what about the fingernails?

68
00:07:45,993 --> 00:07:49,078
Oh, he scraped
his fingernails along things.

69
00:07:49,246 --> 00:07:51,915
Actually, they were more like
finger-knives or something.

70
00:07:52,082 --> 00:07:55,627
Something he made himself,
but they made a horrible sound.

71
00:07:56,212 --> 00:07:57,462
It was like:

72
00:07:59,215 --> 00:08:04,428
Nancy, you dreamed
about the same creep I did.

73
00:08:05,388 --> 00:08:06,972
That's impossible.

74
00:08:09,768 --> 00:08:10,768
What?

75
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:13,771
Nothing.

76
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:17,942
- There's something out there, isn't there?
- I didn't hear anything.

77
00:08:18,109 --> 00:08:20,945
Well, I heard something.

78
00:08:54,563 --> 00:08:58,149
I'm gonna punch out your ugly lights,
whoever you are.

79
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,446
Kitty, kitty.

80
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,664
Chow, chow, chow.

81
00:09:18,504 --> 00:09:22,465
It's Rod Lane bringing Lantz down
just three yards from the goal line!

82
00:09:22,633 --> 00:09:25,176
What a brilliant tackle,
and the fans go wild.

83
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:29,681
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Came to make up. No big deal.

84
00:09:29,849 --> 00:09:32,601
- Your mom home?
- Course.

85
00:09:32,768 --> 00:09:35,562
- Oh, what's that?
- Intense, huh?

86
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:41,776
So, what's going on here,
an orgy or something?

87
00:09:41,944 --> 00:09:43,695
Maybe a funeral, dickhead.

88
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:46,281
It's just a sleepover date, Rod.

89
00:09:46,449 --> 00:09:49,409
Tina and me. Glen was just leaving.

90
00:09:51,747 --> 00:09:54,206
- You see his face?
- "You see his face?"

91
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,710
Your mom ain't home, is she?

92
00:09:57,878 --> 00:10:00,463
Me and Tina got stuff to discuss.

93
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,214
Rod.

94
00:10:03,884 --> 00:10:07,928
We got her mother's bed.
You guys got the rest.

95
00:10:11,224 --> 00:10:14,101
I think we should get out of here.

96
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:17,063
Hey, you guys are gonna
hang around, right?

97
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:20,024
I mean, don't leave me alone
with this lunatic.

98
00:10:20,192 --> 00:10:21,567
Please, Nancy?

99
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,826
Glen, not now.

100
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:34,413
We're here for Tina now, not ourselves.

101
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:40,628
Why is she so bothered
by a stupid nightmare, anyway?

102
00:10:40,796 --> 00:10:43,839
Because he was scary, that's why.

103
00:11:00,942 --> 00:11:02,359
Yeah.

104
00:11:06,197 --> 00:11:07,447
Oh, Rod!

105
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:10,117
Yeah. Yeah, Tina!

106
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,454
Oh, God! Oh, God!

107
00:11:16,791 --> 00:11:18,208
Oh, God!

108
00:11:18,376 --> 00:11:21,128
Oh, God! Oh, Rod!

109
00:11:23,923 --> 00:11:26,258
Morality sucks.

110
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,648
I knew there was something about you
I liked.

111
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:44,819
- You feel better now, right?
- Jungle man fix Jane.

112
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:47,822
No more fights?

113
00:11:50,075 --> 00:11:51,159
No more fights.

114
00:11:51,326 --> 00:11:53,161
Good.

115
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:55,872
No more nightmares
for either one of us, then.

116
00:11:57,666 --> 00:12:00,293
When did you have a nightmare?

117
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,006
Guys can have nightmares too,
you know.

118
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:08,176
You ain't got a corner
on the market or something.

119
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,197
Rod?

120
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:18,747
Tina.

121
00:13:42,982 --> 00:13:44,816
Tina.

122
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:49,195
Who do you think you are?

123
00:13:50,114 --> 00:13:52,407
Whoever you are.

124
00:15:03,271 --> 00:15:04,897
Somebody there?

125
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:06,899
Tina.

126
00:15:24,794 --> 00:15:26,544
Tina.

127
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:29,214
Who the hell is that?

128
00:15:54,407 --> 00:15:55,740
Tina.

129
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:59,244
Shit.

130
00:16:08,963 --> 00:16:10,130
Please, God...

131
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:12,133
This...

132
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,467
...is God.

133
00:16:22,769 --> 00:16:26,397
No! No! No!

134
00:16:27,441 --> 00:16:29,150
Yes!

135
00:16:32,696 --> 00:16:34,572
Tina!

136
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:37,366
Watch this.

137
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,504
Nancy! Open the door!

138
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:52,465
Nancy!

139
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:09,649
Rod, help me! Oh, God!

140
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:11,777
No! No!

141
00:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,445
Help me, Rod!

142
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:16,823
Help me! Rod! Rod!

143
00:17:17,742 --> 00:17:21,328
- Help me!
- Tina!

144
00:17:40,515 --> 00:17:42,140
Tina!

145
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:46,937
Tina! Tina!

146
00:17:47,105 --> 00:17:49,397
Tina!

147
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:53,527
- Tina!
- Rod! Rod!

148
00:17:55,571 --> 00:17:57,364
Tina!

149
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,540
- Tina? Tina?
Who did this? I'll kill you.

150
00:18:05,707 --> 00:18:08,626
- Who did this?
- Aaagh! Oh, God, you scared me!

151
00:18:26,728 --> 00:18:27,770
What have you got?

152
00:18:27,938 --> 00:18:30,398
Her name was Tina Gray.
It's her home.

153
00:18:30,566 --> 00:18:33,693
Father abandoned 10 years ago,
mother's in Vegas with her boyfriend.

154
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:36,237
- We're trying to reach her.
- What's the coroner got?

155
00:18:36,405 --> 00:18:40,741
Something like a razor was the weapon,
but nothing was found at the scene.

156
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:42,952
It looks like the victim's boyfriend.

157
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,328
Lieutenant.
- Where is she?

158
00:18:44,496 --> 00:18:48,583
- I put her in your office.
- His name's Rod Lane. He's a musician type.

159
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:53,254
- Arrests for drugs, brawling.
- Terrific. What the hell was she doing there?

160
00:18:53,422 --> 00:18:54,422
She lived there.

161
00:18:55,508 --> 00:18:57,634
I don't mean her.

162
00:18:58,511 --> 00:19:00,679
I mean you.

163
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:03,765
What was she doing there?

164
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,018
Hello to you too, Donald.

165
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,438
Marge. Okay.

166
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:16,195
How you doing, baby?

167
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:18,697
I'm okay, Dad.

168
00:19:19,866 --> 00:19:21,700
Look, I don't wanna
get into this now...

169
00:19:21,868 --> 00:19:24,620
...God knows you need time,
but I sure would like to know...

170
00:19:24,787 --> 00:19:28,957
...what the hell you were doing shacking up
with three kids in the middle of the night...

171
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,335
...especially a lunatic delinquent
like Lane.

172
00:19:31,961 --> 00:19:34,171
Rod is not a lunatic, Dad.

173
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:37,132
You have a sane explanation
for what he did?

174
00:19:39,385 --> 00:19:41,637
Apparently, he was crazy jealous.

175
00:19:41,804 --> 00:19:45,140
- Nancy said they'd had a fight.
- It wasn't that serious.

176
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:47,226
Maybe you don't think murder is serious.

177
00:19:47,393 --> 00:19:50,688
How can you say I don't take
her death seriously?

178
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,319
Look, all I meant...

179
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,949
...was that their fights
weren't that serious.

180
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,330
You know, Tina...

181
00:20:07,498 --> 00:20:09,499
...she dreamed this was gonna happen.

182
00:20:10,501 --> 00:20:12,126
What?

183
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:18,049
She had a nightmare
that someone was trying to kill her.

184
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:24,347
That's why we were there, Mom.
She just didn't wanna sleep alone.

185
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:34,065
Police say the victim,
15-year-old Christina Gray...

186
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,734
...had quarreled earlier
with her boyfriend, Rod Lane.

187
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,238
Lane is now the subject
of a citywide manhunt.

188
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:44,493
The murder weapon, a straight razor
or similar sharp object, has not yet...

189
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:50,332
Where do you think you're going?

190
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,210
School.

191
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,671
You were tossing and turning
all night last night.

192
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,048
You have no business
going to school today.

193
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:02,011
I've gotta go to school, Mother.
Otherwise I'll sit up there and go crazy.

194
00:21:02,178 --> 00:21:04,179
Did you sleep?

195
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:07,224
I'll sleep in study hall.

196
00:21:07,726 --> 00:21:10,561
I'd rather keep busy, you know?

197
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:14,231
- Right home after?
- Right home after.

198
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,691
Okay.

199
00:21:16,401 --> 00:21:18,819
- See you.
- See you.

200
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:59,319
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

201
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,784
- They're gonna kill me for sure.
- Nobody's gonna kill you.

202
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:09,454
Did you do it?

203
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:14,459
- I never touched her.
- You were screaming like crazy.

204
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:16,461
There was somebody else there.

205
00:22:16,629 --> 00:22:18,797
The door was locked from your side.

206
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:22,092
Don't look at me like I'm some
fucking fruitcake or something!

207
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:26,012
- I'm warning you.
- Just move away from her, son.

208
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,140
Real easy,
like your ass depended on it.

209
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:30,642
Hold it!

210
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:33,521
- No!
- Jesus Christ.

211
00:22:42,322 --> 00:22:43,364
Hold it right there.

212
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:45,991
Watch it. Hold them.
- All right. I'm cool, I'm cool.

213
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,285
Okay, I got him.
On the ground, now.

214
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:51,414
Come on. Get down.
- Lieutenant, look at this. A switchblade.

215
00:22:51,581 --> 00:22:54,291
I didn't do it! I didn't kill her, Nancy!

216
00:22:54,459 --> 00:22:55,709
Daddy?

217
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,837
You used me.

218
00:22:58,338 --> 00:23:01,173
What the hell were you doing
going to school today for anyway?

219
00:23:02,968 --> 00:23:04,385
Nancy.

220
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:06,053
Nancy!

221
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,348
- Nancy!
Come on, let go of my arm.

222
00:23:09,516 --> 00:23:13,352
What is seen is not always what is real.

223
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:18,190
According to Shakespeare,
there was something operating in nature...

224
00:23:18,650 --> 00:23:22,736
...perhaps inside human nature itself,
that was rotten.

225
00:23:23,196 --> 00:23:26,031
A canker, as he put it.

226
00:23:26,658 --> 00:23:29,035
Now, of course,
Hamlet's response to this...

227
00:23:29,203 --> 00:23:35,375
...and to his mother's lies,
was to continually probe and dig.

228
00:23:35,626 --> 00:23:38,253
Just like the gravediggers...

229
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:41,715
...always trying to get
beneath the surface.

230
00:23:42,216 --> 00:23:46,553
The same is true in a different way
in Julius Caesar. John, go ahead, please.

231
00:23:54,687 --> 00:24:00,233
In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
a little ere the mightiest Julius fell.

232
00:24:00,401 --> 00:24:03,320
The graves stood tenantless,
and the sheeted dead...

233
00:24:03,488 --> 00:24:06,615
...did squeak and gibber
in the Roman streets:

234
00:24:06,782 --> 00:24:09,409
As stars with trains of fire
and dews of blood...

235
00:24:09,577 --> 00:24:11,745
...disasters in the sun, and the moist star...

236
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:14,748
...upon whose influence
Neptune's empire stands...

237
00:24:14,916 --> 00:24:17,250
Nancy.

238
00:24:20,254 --> 00:24:21,630
Nancy.

239
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:29,931
O God! I could be bounded in a nutshell...

240
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:34,060
...and count myself a king
of infinite space...

241
00:24:34,978 --> 00:24:40,024
...were it not that I have bad dreams.

242
00:25:00,754 --> 00:25:19,982
Tina?

243
00:25:26,531 --> 00:25:30,325
- Where's your pass?
- Screw your pass.

244
00:25:33,871 --> 00:25:35,789
Hey, Nancy.

245
00:25:36,374 --> 00:25:39,167
No running in the hallway.

246
00:25:58,021 --> 00:25:59,688
Tina?

247
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:29,010
Tina?

248
00:26:48,947 --> 00:26:54,535
Tina?

249
00:27:00,584 --> 00:27:01,626
Who are you?

250
00:27:49,092 --> 00:27:51,135
Gonna get you.

251
00:28:00,312 --> 00:28:04,232
- It's only a dream!
- Come to Freddy.

252
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,859
Goddamn you!

253
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:14,242
No! No!

254
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,746
Okay! Okay, okay! Thompson!

255
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:20,331
I'll call your mother.

256
00:28:20,666 --> 00:28:22,834
Everything is all right now.

257
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:25,837
- Come on. Sit down.
- No.

258
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:31,217
I'm okay. I'm fine.

259
00:28:31,385 --> 00:28:35,096
You sure?
- Yeah. I'll go straight home.

260
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,391
You'll need a hall pass.

261
00:28:41,103 --> 00:28:43,188
Back to work.

262
00:29:07,547 --> 00:29:09,465
God!

263
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:40,579
- And then what happened?
- I told you.

264
00:29:41,122 --> 00:29:44,041
It was dark, but I'm sure
there was somebody in there...

265
00:29:44,209 --> 00:29:45,626
...under the covers with her.

266
00:29:46,086 --> 00:29:49,881
How could somebody be under the covers
with you without you knowing about it?

267
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:51,925
How the fuck do I know?

268
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,970
I don't expect you to believe me anyway.

269
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:59,474
What did he look like?

270
00:30:01,227 --> 00:30:02,602
Did you get a look at him?

271
00:30:04,939 --> 00:30:06,565
No.

272
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:10,485
Well, then how do you know
that somebody else was there?

273
00:30:11,445 --> 00:30:13,613
Because somebody cut her
while I watched.

274
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:18,702
- And you didn't get a look at him?
- I couldn't even see the fucker.

275
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:20,996
You could just see...

276
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:23,957
...cuts happening...

277
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:25,166
...all at once.

278
00:30:25,877 --> 00:30:28,420
What do you mean all at once?

279
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:35,302
I mean, it was as if
there were four razors...

280
00:30:35,761 --> 00:30:38,638
...cutting her at the same time...

281
00:30:39,056 --> 00:30:40,974
...but invisible ones.

282
00:30:42,143 --> 00:30:45,229
You know,
I probably could have saved her...

283
00:30:46,523 --> 00:30:48,274
...if I'd have moved sooner...

284
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:53,779
...but I thought it was
just another nightmare...

285
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:56,866
...like the one I had the night before.

286
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:02,163
There was this... There was this guy.

287
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,668
He had knives for fingers.

288
00:31:18,305 --> 00:31:19,889
Hey, you think I did it?

289
00:31:22,017 --> 00:31:23,809
No.

290
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:44,665
One, two
Freddy's coming for you

291
00:31:45,249 --> 00:31:50,504
Three, four
Better lock your door

292
00:31:50,713 --> 00:31:56,218
Five, six
Grab your crucifix

293
00:31:56,386 --> 00:32:02,349
Seven, eight
Gonna stay up late

294
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:11,316
Nine, 10
Never sleep again

295
00:32:25,498 --> 00:32:28,583
Nancy?
- What, Mother?

296
00:32:28,751 --> 00:32:30,460
Don't fall asleep in there.

297
00:32:30,628 --> 00:32:33,798
- You could drown, you know.
- Oh, for Pete's sakes.

298
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:35,299
It happens all the time.

299
00:32:35,467 --> 00:32:37,301
I've heated up some warm milk for you.

300
00:32:37,761 --> 00:32:40,805
Warm milk? Gross.

301
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,963
Help!

302
00:33:21,013 --> 00:33:22,847
Nancy!

303
00:33:29,481 --> 00:33:32,316
- Hold on, baby!
- Mom!

304
00:33:37,572 --> 00:33:38,655
I'm okay.

305
00:33:38,823 --> 00:33:41,325
- You're okay?
- I'm okay.

306
00:33:41,493 --> 00:33:43,827
But I heard you screaming.
You were calling me.

307
00:33:43,995 --> 00:33:47,623
I just slipped
getting out of the tub, Mom.

308
00:33:47,791 --> 00:33:51,335
I told you hundreds of people a year
get killed like that, honey.

309
00:33:51,503 --> 00:33:54,922
I know, but I'm okay, Mother.
I'm sorry for scaring you.

310
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,632
It's okay.

311
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,509
I'll turn down your bed, okay?

312
00:33:58,676 --> 00:34:00,385
All right. I'll get my pajamas on.

313
00:34:00,553 --> 00:34:01,845
Okay.

314
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:26,287
all-consuming act
of bodily dismemberment.

315
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:29,040
No! No!

316
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,287
Hi.
- God!

317
00:35:08,497 --> 00:35:11,291
I'm sorry. Your light was on.
I thought I'd see how you were.

318
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:14,085
Sometimes I wish
you didn't live right across the street.

319
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:17,339
Will you shut up and let me in?
Ever stand on a trellis in your bare feet?

320
00:35:17,507 --> 00:35:19,049
Get inside before somebody sees you.

321
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21,594
I hit my head.

322
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:24,388
Gotta be quiet.
Mom's not even asleep yet.

323
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:30,269
If you don't mind.

324
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:41,488
I heard you freaked out
in English class today.

325
00:35:41,656 --> 00:35:45,618
- Yeah, I guess I did.
- You haven't slept yet, have you?

326
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:49,622
- Not really.
- What did you do to your arm?

327
00:35:50,624 --> 00:35:52,166
I burned it in English class.

328
00:35:57,464 --> 00:36:00,799
Oh, God. I look 20 years old.

329
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,639
Did you have
any weird dreams last night?

330
00:36:06,806 --> 00:36:08,265
Slept like a rock.

331
00:36:08,808 --> 00:36:12,145
Do you believe that people can dream
about what's going to happen?

332
00:36:16,108 --> 00:36:18,318
- No.
- Do you believe in the boogeyman?

333
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:19,736
No.

334
00:36:19,904 --> 00:36:22,614
Rod killed Tina, and you know that.

335
00:36:23,991 --> 00:36:26,034
I've got a crazy favor to ask you.

336
00:36:26,661 --> 00:36:28,870
- uh-oh.
- It's nothing hard or anything.

337
00:36:30,498 --> 00:36:33,500
I'm gonna go and look for somebody...

338
00:36:33,668 --> 00:36:38,505
...and I want you to stand
like a sort of a guard, okay?

339
00:36:40,216 --> 00:36:43,051
- Okay?
- Okay.

340
00:36:44,303 --> 00:36:48,515
Now, you can't mess up.
A lot might depend on this.

341
00:36:48,683 --> 00:36:50,350
I won't screw up.

342
00:36:50,851 --> 00:36:52,060
Okay, turn off the light.

343
00:36:57,233 --> 00:37:00,527
- Okay, here's what we're gonna do.
- It's dark in here.

344
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,280
And it's not what you're thinking.

345
00:37:54,374 --> 00:37:56,083
Glen?

346
00:37:56,918 --> 00:37:57,960
Are you still watching?

347
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:03,175
- Yeah, so?
- I'm just checking.

348
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:37,353
Glen!

349
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:40,356
Glen?

350
00:39:43,026 --> 00:39:45,111
Glen!

351
00:39:49,784 --> 00:39:54,746
Rod! Watch out! Rod! Watch out!

352
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,416
Glen!

353
00:40:03,715 --> 00:40:07,885
- Glen!
Nancy.

354
00:40:09,888 --> 00:40:12,473
Nancy.

355
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,859
Glen!

356
00:40:24,777 --> 00:40:27,112
Wake up!

357
00:40:28,448 --> 00:40:30,824
Are you there?

358
00:40:30,992 --> 00:40:33,494
I'm here.

359
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:05,818
Nancy, help me, please.

360
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:07,737
- Save me from...
- Freddy.

361
00:41:12,743 --> 00:41:14,702
Glen!

362
00:41:19,458 --> 00:41:24,921
This is just a dream. This isn't real.
This is just a dream. He isn't real. He isn't...

363
00:41:42,732 --> 00:41:44,441
Glen!

364
00:41:48,822 --> 00:42:00,207
No!

365
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:01,834
Glen, no!

366
00:42:15,765 --> 00:42:18,851
Glen, you bastard.

367
00:42:19,686 --> 00:42:20,853
What did I do?

368
00:42:21,021 --> 00:42:24,857
I just asked you to do one thing,
just stay awake and watch me...

369
00:42:25,025 --> 00:42:28,944
...just wake me up if it looked
like I was having a bad dream...

370
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:33,408
...and what did you do?
You shithead. You fell asleep.

371
00:42:33,576 --> 00:42:35,035
Nancy?
Oh, shit.

372
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:37,746
Hurry.

373
00:42:39,165 --> 00:42:41,583
Shut up and stay there.
Don't go away.

374
00:42:47,381 --> 00:42:49,132
Are you okay?

375
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,761
Yeah. It was just a little dream.
I'm going right back to sleep.

376
00:42:52,928 --> 00:42:55,597
Okay. Call me if you need anything, okay?

377
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:57,599
Okay.

378
00:43:05,274 --> 00:43:06,900
Glen.

379
00:43:14,909 --> 00:43:17,911
- You mind telling me what's going on?
- Oh, just come on.

380
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,079
Yeah.

381
00:43:20,122 --> 00:43:23,500
Garcia, I've gotta see Rod Lane again.

382
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:27,046
You know, I took the night shift
so I could get some peace and quiet.

383
00:43:27,214 --> 00:43:28,422
Look, it's urgent!

384
00:43:45,357 --> 00:43:48,818
We have reason to believe there might
be something strange going on here.

385
00:43:48,985 --> 00:43:50,444
Got no argument with that.

386
00:43:51,154 --> 00:43:52,279
What are you doing here?

387
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,366
There's an unsolved murder,
and I don't like unsolved murders.

388
00:43:55,534 --> 00:43:57,660
Especially ones that my daughter's
mixed up in.

389
00:43:57,828 --> 00:43:59,120
What are you doing here?

390
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:02,998
- At this hour, you should be home in bed.
- I just wanna see if he's okay.

391
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:06,293
Nancy, take my word for it.
The guy's sleeping like a baby.

392
00:44:06,461 --> 00:44:07,586
He's not going anywhere.

393
00:44:15,804 --> 00:44:17,638
Just go down and look at him.

394
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,476
Please, Daddy.

395
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:27,023
All right. Garcia, give me the keys.

396
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:29,317
All right.

397
00:44:30,403 --> 00:44:32,028
Where the hell did I put the keys?

398
00:44:41,372 --> 00:44:43,331
Hey, hey!

399
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:55,010
Help! Help! Help!

400
00:45:02,643 --> 00:45:04,019
Jesus!

401
00:45:04,812 --> 00:45:06,354
Rod!

402
00:45:10,735 --> 00:45:11,777
Hurry. Cut him down.

403
00:45:13,863 --> 00:45:15,823
Grab his legs.
I got him.

404
00:45:15,991 --> 00:45:17,992
God!

405
00:45:18,786 --> 00:45:21,204
Goddamn crazy kid.

406
00:45:22,122 --> 00:45:24,165
Grab his back, would you?
- Got it.

407
00:45:24,333 --> 00:45:26,501
Lower him.

408
00:45:50,108 --> 00:45:52,902
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

409
00:45:53,695 --> 00:45:56,614
May God be
with this young man's soul.

410
00:45:58,158 --> 00:46:03,162
His life and his death
attest to the scriptures' warning...

411
00:46:03,372 --> 00:46:06,749
...that he who lives by the sword
shall die by the sword.

412
00:46:08,418 --> 00:46:12,256
But let us recall also
our Lord's admonition...

413
00:46:12,423 --> 00:46:16,301
...that we judge not, lest we be judged.

414
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:19,304
And may Rod Lane rest in peace.

415
00:46:25,144 --> 00:46:27,437
Time to go, honey.

416
00:46:33,736 --> 00:46:35,445
Hop in.

417
00:46:38,283 --> 00:46:39,950
The killer's still loose, you know.

418
00:46:41,202 --> 00:46:44,454
You're saying somebody else
killed Tina. Who?

419
00:46:45,456 --> 00:46:47,833
I don't know who he is...

420
00:46:48,543 --> 00:46:52,170
...but he's burned,
and he wears a weird hat...

421
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,842
...and a red and green sweater,
really dirty...

422
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:01,638
...and he uses these knives,
like giant fingernails.

423
00:47:04,977 --> 00:47:08,980
Better keep her home for a few days,
until she gets over the shock of this.

424
00:47:09,148 --> 00:47:12,483
I've got something better.
I'm going to get her some help.

425
00:47:37,509 --> 00:47:41,054
I don't see why you couldn't just
give me a pill to keep me from dreaming.

426
00:47:41,221 --> 00:47:45,141
Everyone's got to dream, young lady.
If you don't dream, you go.

427
00:47:46,226 --> 00:47:48,394
Okay, all set?

428
00:47:49,229 --> 00:47:53,358
- No.
- Please, Nancy, trust us.

429
00:47:53,525 --> 00:47:56,694
It's not you I don't trust. It's just...

430
00:48:02,035 --> 00:48:03,994
Okay.

431
00:48:05,038 --> 00:48:07,039
Let's do it.

432
00:48:12,921 --> 00:48:15,047
Thank you, nurse.

433
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:35,567
How long has this been going on?
- Since the murders.

434
00:48:35,735 --> 00:48:37,820
She was fine before that.

435
00:48:38,446 --> 00:48:40,322
Now she thinks her dreams are real.

436
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,493
Well, there's no sign of pathology
in her EEG.

437
00:48:44,661 --> 00:48:47,079
I'd guess that what we have
is just a normal girl...

438
00:48:47,247 --> 00:48:50,082
...who happens to have gone
through two days of hell.

439
00:48:56,924 --> 00:48:58,258
Okay.

440
00:48:59,427 --> 00:49:00,760
She's asleep now.

441
00:49:01,595 --> 00:49:02,929
Thank God.

442
00:49:06,308 --> 00:49:09,269
What the hell are dreams anyway?

443
00:49:09,603 --> 00:49:12,731
Mysteries. Incredible body hocus-pocus.

444
00:49:12,898 --> 00:49:18,319
The truth is we still don't know
what they are or where they come from.

445
00:49:24,994 --> 00:49:29,664
Okay. She's going into deep sleep now.

446
00:49:31,959 --> 00:49:35,128
Heart rate is a little high.
It's just due to anxiety.

447
00:49:35,296 --> 00:49:37,964
Otherwise she's nicely relaxed.

448
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:42,469
All signs are normal.
She could dream at any time now.

449
00:49:46,265 --> 00:49:48,184
Beta waves are slowing.

450
00:49:52,981 --> 00:49:55,649
She's into REMs now.

451
00:49:56,026 --> 00:49:58,986
She's definitely dreaming now.

452
00:49:59,154 --> 00:50:02,823
It's a good one too.
Typical dream parameter.

453
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:08,079
A nightmare now
would be plus or minus five or six.

454
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,415
She's about three.

455
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:20,841
- Doctor, what's she doing now?
- I'm not...

456
00:50:21,009 --> 00:50:22,176
Is she asleep or awake?

457
00:50:22,344 --> 00:50:24,720
Something's wrong.
It never gets this high.

458
00:50:25,847 --> 00:50:28,265
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.

459
00:50:28,433 --> 00:50:29,725
Is she dreaming?

460
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,026
Listen...
- Nancy! Nancy, it's Mom, it's Mom.

461
00:50:39,194 --> 00:50:40,361
Nancy. It's Mom.

462
00:50:44,283 --> 00:50:46,993
What? Her hair.

463
00:50:47,161 --> 00:50:49,246
- Excuse me.
This'll help you sleep.

464
00:50:50,206 --> 00:50:52,040
No!

465
00:50:52,208 --> 00:50:54,709
Oh, my God, her arm!
Get something.

466
00:50:56,087 --> 00:50:58,338
What happened, baby? What happened?

467
00:51:01,717 --> 00:51:04,136
It's okay, it's okay.

468
00:51:06,264 --> 00:51:09,057
I brought something out from my dream.

469
00:51:09,225 --> 00:51:11,268
Where did you get that?

470
00:51:13,938 --> 00:51:15,480
I grabbed it off his head.

471
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:33,039
Donald, she said she grabbed it
off his head in her dream.

472
00:51:33,207 --> 00:51:34,749
No, I'm not crazy.

473
00:51:34,917 --> 00:51:37,628
I'm holding the damn thing
right here in my hand.

474
00:51:37,796 --> 00:51:42,091
I don't know where she really found it.
I gotta go.

475
00:51:53,353 --> 00:51:56,272
You didn't sleep at all last night,
did you?

476
00:51:57,774 --> 00:52:01,652
- The doctor says you have to sleep, or...
- I'll go even crazier?

477
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:06,574
I don't think you're crazy,
and stop drinking that damn coffee.

478
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:14,457
So did you ask Daddy
to have the hat examined?

479
00:52:14,875 --> 00:52:18,002
I threw that filthy thing away.

480
00:52:18,503 --> 00:52:21,464
I don't know where you found it
or what you're trying to prove...

481
00:52:21,632 --> 00:52:26,052
What I learned in the dream clinic,
that's what I'm trying to prove, Mother.

482
00:52:26,637 --> 00:52:31,307
Rod didn't kill Tina,
and he didn't hang himself.

483
00:52:32,185 --> 00:52:33,769
It's this guy.

484
00:52:34,979 --> 00:52:37,314
He's after us in our dreams.

485
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:43,320
That's just not reality, Nancy.

486
00:52:43,488 --> 00:52:45,656
It's real, Mama.

487
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:46,949
Feel it.

488
00:52:47,659 --> 00:52:51,328
- Give me that damn thing.
- It even has his name written in it.

489
00:52:51,496 --> 00:52:53,580
Fred Krueger, Mom.

490
00:52:53,748 --> 00:52:55,832
Fred Krueger.

491
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:59,378
Do you know who that is, Mother?
Because if you do, you better tell me...

492
00:52:59,545 --> 00:53:01,213
...because he's after me now.

493
00:53:01,381 --> 00:53:04,925
Nancy, trust your mother
for once, please.

494
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:07,261
You'll feel better
when you get some sleep.

495
00:53:07,428 --> 00:53:09,304
Feel better?

496
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:12,224
You call this feeling better?

497
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:16,853
Or maybe I should grab that bottle
and veg out with you.

498
00:53:17,021 --> 00:53:20,732
Avoid everything happening to me
by just getting good and loaded.

499
00:53:28,158 --> 00:53:30,910
Fred Krueger can't come
after you, Nancy.

500
00:53:31,078 --> 00:53:35,456
He's dead. Believe me. I know.

501
00:53:35,624 --> 00:53:39,043
You knew about him all this time...

502
00:53:39,211 --> 00:53:42,547
...and you've been acting
like it was something I made up?

503
00:53:42,715 --> 00:53:45,216
Nancy, you're sick.

504
00:53:45,384 --> 00:53:48,886
There's something wrong with you.
You're imagining things.

505
00:53:49,054 --> 00:53:53,474
You'll feel better when you sleep.
It's just as simple as that.

506
00:53:53,642 --> 00:53:55,310
Screw sleep!

507
00:54:00,858 --> 00:54:03,943
Nancy, it's just a nightmare.

508
00:54:04,111 --> 00:54:06,571
That's enough.

509
00:54:15,289 --> 00:54:17,582
Whenever I get nervous, I eat.

510
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,586
And if you can't do that, you sleep.

511
00:54:20,754 --> 00:54:22,713
I used to.

512
00:54:22,881 --> 00:54:24,590
Not anymore.

513
00:54:28,011 --> 00:54:31,263
Did you ever read about
the Balinese way of dreaming?

514
00:54:32,390 --> 00:54:34,558
No.

515
00:54:34,893 --> 00:54:38,270
They got this whole system
they call dream skills.

516
00:54:38,897 --> 00:54:42,858
So if you have a nightmare, for instance,
like falling, right?

517
00:54:43,026 --> 00:54:45,569
- Right.
- Well...

518
00:54:45,737 --> 00:54:48,781
...instead of screaming
and getting all nuts...

519
00:54:48,948 --> 00:54:52,117
...you say, "Okay, I'm gonna
make up my mind...

520
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:54,119
...that I fall into a magic world. "

521
00:54:54,287 --> 00:54:58,457
Make it something special
like a poem or a song.

522
00:54:59,376 --> 00:55:01,460
They get their art and literature
from dreams.

523
00:55:01,628 --> 00:55:05,381
Just wake up and write it down.
Dream skills.

524
00:55:05,548 --> 00:55:08,342
Well, what if they meet a monster
in their dreams? Then what?

525
00:55:08,510 --> 00:55:11,804
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy and it disappears.

526
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:15,141
But what happens
if they don't do that?

527
00:55:16,477 --> 00:55:19,312
Well, I guess those people
don't wake up to tell what happens.

528
00:55:19,480 --> 00:55:21,147
Great.

529
00:55:24,944 --> 00:55:27,695
"Booby Traps and Improvised
Anti-personnel Devices"?

530
00:55:29,365 --> 00:55:31,074
Well, what are you reading that for?

531
00:55:32,326 --> 00:55:34,577
I'm into survival.

532
00:55:35,538 --> 00:55:39,249
- See you.
You're starting to scare me.

533
00:55:50,177 --> 00:55:52,554
Oh, gross.

534
00:56:21,543 --> 00:56:23,377
Mother!

535
00:56:28,216 --> 00:56:29,925
What's with the bars?

536
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:34,638
- Security.
- Security?

537
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:39,310
- Security from what?
- Not from what, from whom.

538
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:44,773
Come down to the cellar with me
and I'll tell you.

539
00:57:05,963 --> 00:57:08,298
You wanna know who Fred Krueger was?

540
00:57:09,258 --> 00:57:13,887
He was a filthy child murderer who killed
at least 20 kids in the neighborhood.

541
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,680
Kids we all knew.

542
00:57:17,808 --> 00:57:19,559
Oh, Mom.

543
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:22,938
It drove us crazy
when we didn't know who it was...

544
00:57:23,105 --> 00:57:25,982
...but it was even worse
after they caught him.

545
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:36,618
Did they put him away?

546
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:39,412
The lawyers got fat
and the judge got famous...

547
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,874
...but somebody forgot to
sign the search warrant in the right place...

548
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,960
...and Krueger was free, just like that.

549
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:47,963
What did you do, Mother?

550
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:53,593
A bunch of us parents tracked him down
after they let him out.

551
00:57:54,428 --> 00:57:58,891
We found him in an old abandoned
boiler room where he used to take his kids.

552
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,978
Go on.

553
00:58:03,772 --> 00:58:05,856
We took gasoline...

554
00:58:06,692 --> 00:58:11,612
...we poured it all around the place
and made a trail of it out the door...

555
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:15,866
...then lit the whole thing up
and watched it burn.

556
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,459
But he can't get you now.

557
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,380
He's dead, honey,
because Mommy killed him.

558
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,760
I even took his knives.

559
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:45,479
So it's okay now.

560
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:51,110
You can sleep.

561
00:59:01,873 --> 00:59:03,373
- Hello.
Hi.

562
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:07,044
- Oh, hi, how you doing?
- Fine.

563
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:10,589
Stand by your window so I can see you.
You sound a million miles away.

564
00:59:15,928 --> 00:59:17,054
That's much better.

565
00:59:17,889 --> 00:59:20,557
I see your mom went ape
at the security store today.

566
00:59:20,725 --> 00:59:22,643
You look like the Prisoner of Zenda.

567
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,271
- How long's it been since you slept?
- It's coming up on the seventh day.

568
00:59:26,731 --> 00:59:29,483
It's okay. I checked Guinness.
The record's 11.

569
00:59:30,485 --> 00:59:33,236
Listen, Glen. I know who he is.

570
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,447
- Who?
- The killer.

571
00:59:35,615 --> 00:59:37,074
- You do?
- Yes.

572
00:59:37,575 --> 00:59:39,868
And if he gets me,
I'm pretty sure you're next.

573
00:59:40,036 --> 00:59:42,329
Me? Why would anybody wanna kill me?

574
00:59:42,497 --> 00:59:46,208
Don't ask.
Just give me some help nailing the guy...

575
00:59:46,376 --> 00:59:47,584
...when I bring him out.

576
00:59:48,003 --> 00:59:50,672
- Bring him out of what?
- My dream.

577
00:59:52,424 --> 00:59:54,926
- How do you plan to do that?
- Just like I did the hat.

578
00:59:55,094 --> 00:59:57,428
Have a hold of the sucker
when you wake me up.

579
00:59:58,138 --> 00:59:59,514
What...? Wait a minute.

580
00:59:59,682 --> 01:00:01,516
You can't bring somebody
out of a dream.

581
01:00:01,684 --> 01:00:05,978
If I can't, then you can all relax,
because it's just a case of me being nuts.

582
01:00:06,146 --> 01:00:09,440
Yeah, well, I can save you the trouble.
You're nutty as a fruitcake.

583
01:00:09,608 --> 01:00:12,652
- I love you anyway.
- Good.

584
01:00:13,112 --> 01:00:16,280
Then you won't mind cold-cocking this guy
when I bring him out.

585
01:00:16,448 --> 01:00:18,491
- What?
- You heard me.

586
01:00:18,659 --> 01:00:22,328
I grab the guy in my dream.
You see me struggling, so you wake me up.

587
01:00:22,496 --> 01:00:25,498
We both come out, you whack the fucker,
and we got him.

588
01:00:25,666 --> 01:00:27,417
Are you crazy? Hit him with what?

589
01:00:27,584 --> 01:00:30,795
You're the jock.
You have a baseball bat or something.

590
01:00:32,423 --> 01:00:35,049
Just meet me at my porch at midnight.

591
01:00:35,217 --> 01:00:38,010
- Oh, and meanwhile...
- Meanwhile?

592
01:00:38,554 --> 01:00:43,559
Whatever you do, don't fall asleep.

593
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:48,731
Midnight?

594
01:00:58,158 --> 01:01:00,075
Oh, man.

595
01:01:00,243 --> 01:01:01,869
Midnight.

596
01:01:02,036 --> 01:01:04,288
Baseball bats and boogeymen.

597
01:01:05,498 --> 01:01:07,249
Beautiful.

598
01:01:33,693 --> 01:01:36,570
Glen. Honey?

599
01:01:38,532 --> 01:01:40,700
Glen.

600
01:01:43,621 --> 01:01:45,580
Glen. Glen.

601
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:52,712
How can you listen to television
and hear your records at the same time?

602
01:01:53,297 --> 01:01:56,549
Oh, I wasn't listening to the tube, Ma.
Just watching.

603
01:01:56,717 --> 01:01:59,093
Miss Nude America
is gonna be on tonight.

604
01:01:59,845 --> 01:02:03,556
- How can you hear what she's going to say?
- Who cares what she says?

605
01:02:04,266 --> 01:02:06,309
Don't be such a smart guy.

606
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:10,522
I want you to go to bed.
It's almost midnight.

607
01:02:10,689 --> 01:02:13,942
Goodness knows we've all
had a lot to deal with these last few days.

608
01:02:14,109 --> 01:02:19,405
- I will, Mom. You guys turning in?
- Pretty soon. Now get to bed.

609
01:02:30,167 --> 01:02:34,046
It's over now, baby.
The nightmare's over.

610
01:02:34,214 --> 01:02:35,923
Please.

611
01:02:37,425 --> 01:02:39,385
Okay.

612
01:03:56,672 --> 01:03:58,924
You shouldn't stare.

613
01:03:59,884 --> 01:04:01,927
You know what I think?

614
01:04:02,094 --> 01:04:05,305
I think that kid is some kind of lunatic
or something.

615
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:10,060
Oh, you shouldn't talk that way
about that poor child.

616
01:04:10,227 --> 01:04:12,354
You mean those bars?

617
01:04:12,521 --> 01:04:16,483
Marge is just being cautious,
what with her being all alone...

618
01:04:16,651 --> 01:04:21,197
...and Nancy acting so nervous lately.

619
01:04:21,365 --> 01:04:22,865
I don't care what you say.

620
01:04:23,033 --> 01:04:26,285
I don't want that kid
hanging around with our son anymore.

621
01:05:16,754 --> 01:05:18,672
Glen, answer the phone.

622
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:22,259
Hello.

623
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:29,933
Just a minute. It's her.
She wants to talk to Glen.

624
01:05:30,101 --> 01:05:31,977
About what?

625
01:05:32,437 --> 01:05:35,272
What's this about, Nancy?

626
01:05:36,482 --> 01:05:38,108
Just a minute.

627
01:05:38,276 --> 01:05:43,321
She says it's private, very private
and very important.

628
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:46,950
Give me that. Glen's asleep.
You'll have to talk to him tomorrow.

629
01:05:47,118 --> 01:05:50,078
You've just gotta be firm
with these kids, that's all. Let's go.

630
01:05:50,246 --> 01:05:52,289
As a matter of fact...

631
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,468
Damn.

632
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:12,727
Glen. Don't fall asleep.

633
01:06:23,489 --> 01:06:25,031
Glen?

634
01:06:30,329 --> 01:06:32,413
No!

635
01:06:36,543 --> 01:06:38,669
Oh, brilliant.

636
01:06:40,005 --> 01:06:43,132
What if Glen tries to call?

637
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:20,712
- Hello.
I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy.

638
01:07:32,267 --> 01:07:34,476
My boyfriend.

639
01:07:41,109 --> 01:07:46,071
- Mom!
- Locked, locked, locked, locked.

640
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:49,199
I locked it all up. I had to.

641
01:07:49,367 --> 01:07:54,079
Nancy, you are going to
get some sleep tonight if it kills me.

642
01:07:54,247 --> 01:07:57,082
Give me the key, Mother.

643
01:07:57,250 --> 01:08:01,087
I can't. I don't even have it on me. See?

644
01:08:01,255 --> 01:08:02,255
Damn it!

645
01:08:10,723 --> 01:08:12,599
ANNOuNCER
It is now 12 midnight...

646
01:08:12,766 --> 01:08:17,145
...and this is Station KRGR
leaving the air.

647
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:26,196
No! No! No! Ma!

648
01:08:30,993 --> 01:08:34,287
Glen! Glen!

649
01:09:07,405 --> 01:09:10,574
Come on, Frankie.
Give me a hand. Come on.

650
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:15,371
You won't need a stretcher up there.
You'll need a mop.

651
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:20,417
Let's go. Let's go.

652
01:09:22,921 --> 01:09:24,546
Hey!

653
01:09:26,174 --> 01:09:27,800
Don't tell me it's another one.

654
01:09:27,968 --> 01:09:29,677
Lieutenant, I'm sorry to wake you...

655
01:09:29,844 --> 01:09:32,179
...but I've never seen anything
like this before...

656
01:09:32,347 --> 01:09:35,766
...and this is your neighborhood,
so I thought I'd better call right away.

657
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:38,686
The coroner's upstairs now,
but I don't think he's gonna...

658
01:09:53,953 --> 01:09:55,870
Would have woke me up.

659
01:09:57,915 --> 01:09:59,958
Oh, my God.

660
01:10:01,210 --> 01:10:03,670
Hello?

661
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:05,714
Yeah, I'll get him right away.

662
01:10:06,549 --> 01:10:08,842
Lieutenant, it's your daughter.

663
01:10:17,101 --> 01:10:20,478
- Nancy.
- Hi, Daddy.

664
01:10:21,272 --> 01:10:25,191
- I know what happened.
- I haven't been upstairs yet.

665
01:10:25,359 --> 01:10:28,028
Yeah, but you know he's dead, right?

666
01:10:28,195 --> 01:10:30,280
Yeah. Apparently he's dead.

667
01:10:32,199 --> 01:10:35,702
Listen, Daddy.
I've got a proposition for you.

668
01:10:36,495 --> 01:10:39,289
- Listen very carefully, please.
- Nancy.

669
01:10:39,457 --> 01:10:42,001
I'm gonna go
and get the guy who did it...

670
01:10:43,045 --> 01:10:46,422
...and I want you to be there to arrest him
when I bring him out, okay?

671
01:10:46,590 --> 01:10:48,758
Just tell me who did it.
I'll go get him, baby.

672
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:53,471
Fred Krueger did it, Daddy,
and only I can get him.

673
01:10:53,638 --> 01:10:56,432
It's my nightmare he comes to.

674
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:01,937
Just come here and break the door down
in exactly 20 minutes.

675
01:11:02,105 --> 01:11:05,107
- Can you do that?
- Yeah, sure.

676
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:08,986
That'll be exactly half past midnight.

677
01:11:10,822 --> 01:11:14,658
Time... Time enough for me
to fall asleep and find him.

678
01:11:14,826 --> 01:11:17,411
Honey, look, you just do that.
Get yourself some sleep.

679
01:11:17,579 --> 01:11:20,456
- That's what I've been telling you.
- But you'll be here?

680
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:24,085
- They're waiting for you upstairs.
- Yeah. Sure, I'll be there, sweetheart.

681
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:28,214
Now, look, you just get yourself
some rest, please. Deal?

682
01:11:28,382 --> 01:11:31,384
- Deal.
- I love you, sweetheart.

683
01:11:34,679 --> 01:11:37,974
Look, go outside
and watch my daughter's house.

684
01:11:38,142 --> 01:11:41,436
- If you see anything funny, call me.
- Anything funny? Like what?

685
01:11:41,604 --> 01:11:45,774
I don't know. One thing for sure,
I don't want her coming over here.

686
01:11:45,942 --> 01:11:48,902
She's too far gone
to be able to handle this.

687
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:11,944
- What the hell did that, lieutenant?
- I don't know.

688
01:13:12,112 --> 01:13:16,949
- What's the coroner got to say?
- He's in the john puking since he saw it.

689
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:24,123
I guess I should have
told you about him then.

690
01:13:25,042 --> 01:13:28,504
Let's just get some sleep, Mom.
It's gonna be okay.

691
01:13:28,671 --> 01:13:31,673
I was just trying to protect you.

692
01:13:32,509 --> 01:13:35,636
I didn't see
how much you needed to know.

693
01:13:37,722 --> 01:13:42,267
You face things. That's your nature.

694
01:13:42,435 --> 01:13:43,852
That's your gift...

695
01:13:45,605 --> 01:13:48,649
...but sometime
you have to turn away too.

696
01:14:00,578 --> 01:14:01,870
I love you.

697
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:08,126
I love you too, baby.

698
01:14:22,977 --> 01:14:24,477
Night.

699
01:14:29,525 --> 01:14:32,026
Okay, Krueger.

700
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:34,862
We play in your court.

701
01:14:50,546 --> 01:14:55,049
And now I lay me down to sleep.
I pray the Lord my soul to keep...

702
01:14:55,217 --> 01:15:02,015
...and if I die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

What if they meet a monster
in their dreams? Then what?

705
01:15:25,123 --> 01:15:28,250
They turn their back on it.
Take away its energy and it disappears.

706
01:15:28,418 --> 01:15:30,252
But what happens if they don't do that?

707
01:15:30,420 --> 01:15:33,672
Well, then I guess those people
don't wake up to tell what happens.

708
01:16:50,918 --> 01:16:53,586
Nancy.

709
01:17:02,471 --> 01:17:05,766
You dreamed about the same creep I did.

710
01:17:06,810 --> 01:17:09,395
Gonna get you.

711
01:17:17,696 --> 01:17:22,533
No! No! No!

712
01:17:30,333 --> 01:17:33,002
Nancy.

713
01:18:08,372 --> 01:18:10,499
Krueger!

714
01:18:13,169 --> 01:18:15,128
I'm here!

715
01:20:01,070 --> 01:20:05,490
Come out and show yourself,
you bastard!

716
01:20:10,204 --> 01:20:11,747
Shit.

717
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:18,295
Come on, Krueger! Follow me!

718
01:20:24,802 --> 01:20:26,762
Damn it!

719
01:20:27,639 --> 01:20:29,848
Where are you?

720
01:20:30,099 --> 01:20:32,893
Where are you, Krueger?

721
01:20:33,561 --> 01:20:36,355
I know you're here.

Nancy.

725
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:49,327
I got you now!

726
01:21:18,065 --> 01:21:20,900
I'm crazy after all.

727
01:21:34,039 --> 01:21:35,958
It's on, Krueger!

728
01:21:36,126 --> 01:21:39,712
Take it down! Come and get me!

729
01:21:42,090 --> 01:21:44,299
Help! I've got him! Hey, Daddy!

730
01:21:44,467 --> 01:21:48,303
I've got him trapped!
Help! Where are you?

731
01:21:48,471 --> 01:21:52,266
Everything's gonna be all right!
Everything's under control!

732
01:21:52,434 --> 01:21:54,852
Get my dad, you asshole!

733
01:21:58,523 --> 01:22:00,524
Daddy!

734
01:22:04,988 --> 01:22:07,698
Come on! He's in here!

735
01:22:07,866 --> 01:22:09,658
Don't let him kill me too!

736
01:22:25,133 --> 01:22:27,342
Come on, Freddy. Can't you catch me?

737
01:22:30,389 --> 01:22:32,515
I'm gonna split you in two.

738
01:22:40,483 --> 01:22:44,235
Help! Daddy, help me, please!

739
01:22:44,653 --> 01:22:46,488
Maybe I better go tell the lieutenant.

740
01:22:57,041 --> 01:22:59,834
I'll kill you slow.

741
01:23:02,838 --> 01:23:04,839
Now, where are you?

742
01:23:05,007 --> 01:23:06,508
Hey!

743
01:23:07,051 --> 01:23:11,262
No! No, no! No!

744
01:23:38,875 --> 01:23:42,211
Daddy, I did it! Please hurry!

745
01:23:43,088 --> 01:23:45,005
Daddy!

746
01:23:45,173 --> 01:23:47,424
Where are you?

747
01:23:49,970 --> 01:23:52,012
Parker, I need some help here!

748
01:23:52,180 --> 01:23:55,307
Okay, you guys. Come on, let's go.
Let's go. Al, Jim, get over here.

749
01:23:55,475 --> 01:23:58,060
- Nancy!
Daddy!

750
01:23:58,228 --> 01:24:00,688
- Daddy!
Get you out.

751
01:24:00,856 --> 01:24:04,191
Open the door!
Watch yourself, lieutenant.

752
01:24:04,359 --> 01:24:05,401
I got it.

753
01:24:05,569 --> 01:24:08,445
Dad, it's Krueger!
Get out of the way.

754
01:24:10,365 --> 01:24:11,991
Nancy.

755
01:24:14,244 --> 01:24:16,203
This way, guys. Come down here.

756
01:24:16,371 --> 01:24:19,081
What the hell came through here?
As if I know.

757
01:24:19,249 --> 01:24:20,584
Oh, my God.

758
01:24:20,751 --> 01:24:22,711
Nancy, what the hell is going on?

759
01:24:22,879 --> 01:24:24,504
Parker, get up here!

760
01:24:24,672 --> 01:24:28,967
- We got a fire up here too.
Okay, yeah, we're on our way up.

761
01:24:31,762 --> 01:24:34,181
What the hell is going on, Nancy?

762
01:24:34,348 --> 01:24:36,308
He's after Mother!

763
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:51,781
Daddy! Watch out! He's under there!

764
01:25:09,634 --> 01:25:13,678
Mother! Mother, Mother!

765
01:25:18,685 --> 01:25:20,353
Now do you believe me?

766
01:25:21,063 --> 01:25:23,689
They've got the fires out downstairs.

767
01:25:23,857 --> 01:25:25,816
Everything okay up here?

768
01:25:36,703 --> 01:25:38,746
I'm okay.

769
01:25:40,332 --> 01:25:42,792
You go downstairs.

770
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:45,628
I'll be there in a minute.

771
01:25:49,508 --> 01:25:51,425
Lieutenant, is everything all right?

772
01:25:51,593 --> 01:25:54,136
I don't know. I don't know.

773
01:26:26,254 --> 01:26:27,796
I know you're there, Freddy.

774
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:35,595
You think you was
gonna get away from me?

775
01:26:35,763 --> 01:26:37,973
I know you too well now, Freddy.

776
01:26:39,976 --> 01:26:42,769
Now you die.

777
01:26:44,605 --> 01:26:46,898
It's too late, Krueger.

778
01:26:47,066 --> 01:26:49,860
I know the secret now.

779
01:26:50,236 --> 01:26:54,781
This is just a dream. You're not alive.

780
01:26:54,949 --> 01:26:58,660
This whole thing is just a dream.

781
01:27:00,913 --> 01:27:03,082
I want my mother and friends again.

782
01:27:03,667 --> 01:27:05,001
You what?

783
01:27:05,711 --> 01:27:09,756
I take back every bit of energy
I gave you.

784
01:27:11,008 --> 01:27:12,925
You're nothing.

785
01:27:15,429 --> 01:27:16,471
You're shit.

786
01:27:29,443 --> 01:27:31,319
God.

787
01:27:32,488 --> 01:27:34,739
It's bright.

788
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:39,327
It's gonna burn off soon,
or it wouldn't be so bright.

789
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:43,456
- Feeling better?
- Oh, I feel like a million bucks.

790
01:27:43,624 --> 01:27:47,585
They say you've bottomed out
when you can't remember the night before.

791
01:27:47,753 --> 01:27:52,715
You know, baby, I'm gonna stop drinking.
I just don't feel like it anymore.

792
01:27:52,883 --> 01:27:55,009
Did I keep you awake last night?

793
01:27:55,177 --> 01:27:57,888
You look a little bit peaked.

794
01:27:58,139 --> 01:28:02,434
No. I guess I just slept heavy.

795
01:28:02,977 --> 01:28:06,397
