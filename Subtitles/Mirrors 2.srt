1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,510
It was my fault.
I was the one driving when it happened.

3
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,369
After the accident, I started seeing things,
things that couldn't be real.

4
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,419
But I'm not crazy.

5
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:23,259
I know.

6
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,269
Your father knows.

7
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,356
Anyone who knows you knows that.

8
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,038
Look, Max, I've seen you every day
for the past two months.

9
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,271
Maybe you're starting to let go
of your misplaced guilt.

10
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,154
Maybe you're ready to stop blaming
yourself for what happened.

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,513
But there's no one else to blame.

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,798
It's gotten to the point
where I look in the mirror...

13
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,100
and I'm not even sure
what's real anymore.

14
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,719
Fancy mirror.

15
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,999
Whoo

16
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,796
You're a lady-killer, Schow.

17
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,198
Lady-killer.

18
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,772
What's goin' on?

19
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,868
Hey! What-

20
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,279
No!

21
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,295
Yeah.

22
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,369
Max.

23
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,278
- Who's this?
- Are you still sleeping?

24
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,873
- Dad? Is that you?
- Of course it's me.

25
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,797
Yeah. Is everything all right?

26
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,217
Yeah. Did I wake you up?
You don't sound good.

27
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,152
- Thank you.
- I'm fine. I'm just getting some sleep.

28
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:03,999
Careful over there.

29
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,818
Just getting to the point where I can
sleep through the night again.

30
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,456
Good, good. You gotta get your rest.

31
00:09:10,362 --> 00:09:12,582
- Keller.
- Yeah?

32
00:09:12,634 --> 00:09:15,954
- Five minutes.
- Okay, that's great.

33
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,488
That is the Mayflower
signature right there.

34
00:09:22,198 --> 00:09:24,098
That glass has been through so much.

35
00:09:24,132 --> 00:09:26,432
You can see the care
that went into making it.

36
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,370
Even the base came
from the original store.

37
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,216
So that gives us the- its spirit.

38
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,476
I think it's perfect.

39
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,020
Look, Max, for the last two months
the police have been all over us...

40
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:41,129
Iooking for that missing girl.

41
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,214
Max, we may not be able
to open on time.

42
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,496
Really? I didn't know that, Dad.

43
00:09:46,622 --> 00:09:49,322
And then last week
our night security guard goes crazy.

44
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,489
He cuts himself up bad and he quits.

45
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:56,342
Max, I've got weeks of work to do
and two weeks out from opening.

46
00:09:56,518 --> 00:09:58,418
The last thing I need to be doing...

47
00:09:58,499 --> 00:10:00,899
is looking for a new night watchman.

48
00:10:00,901 --> 00:10:04,601
I'm just not sure I'm ready yet, Dad,
after all that's happened this year and...

49
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:07,958
Max. This is what you need.

50
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:10,569
And, honestly,
right now I need you, Max.

51
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:13,450
I know it'll help you
take your mind off things.

52
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:15,104
- Yeah.
- Look.

53
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:18,789
- I think it's gonna be good.
- All right, Dad. I'll do it.

54
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:21,727
Thanks for the opportunity.

55
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:24,837
No, no, no, thank you, Max.
I tell you what.

56
00:10:24,923 --> 00:10:29,523
Why don't you come in to work
a little early and find me...

57
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,650
so that we can say hello
before you clock in. Okay?

58
00:10:32,723 --> 00:10:36,223
- Yeah. Sure. I'll come find you.
- All right.

59
00:10:36,486 --> 00:10:38,486
- We'll see you in a little bit.
- Okay, Dad.

60
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:40,621
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

61
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:05,925
Shoot.

62
00:11:16,531 --> 00:11:17,931
I got it.

63
00:11:19,284 --> 00:11:21,104
Just trying to help.

64
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:32,802
Well you know. That may or may not be the case...

65
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:37,761
but I think that you should put that on your punch list,
then try to take care of that first thing tomorrow.

66
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:38,512
Would you do that?

67
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:43,074
Jenna, will you take care
of the accessories? That'll be great.

68
00:11:45,893 --> 00:11:49,393
Ladies and gentlemen, the thing
I am most proud of in the entire store.

69
00:11:49,473 --> 00:11:51,573
- This is my son Max.
- Hi.

70
00:11:52,067 --> 00:11:54,167
- How are ya, son?
- Good.

71
00:11:54,235 --> 00:11:56,055
Yeah? Get some rest?

72
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,880
- Yeah.
- Okay.

73
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,984
I wanna introduce you
to a few people.

74
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,310
This is Keller Landreaux.

75
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:04,865
He's gonna be our store manager
when we open in a few weeks.

76
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:08,172
Keller told us that we could buy
property down here in New Orleans...

77
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:09,303
for a song and a dime.

78
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:12,192
That's exactly what we did.
Smart man.

79
00:12:13,634 --> 00:12:15,454
Glad to meet you, Max.

80
00:12:15,546 --> 00:12:18,346
My pleasure.
Thanks for having me.

81
00:12:18,617 --> 00:12:21,717
And this beautiful young lady
we have right here...

82
00:12:21,811 --> 00:12:23,231
this is Jenna McCarty.

83
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:26,125
And Jenna is the head buyer
for the store...

84
00:12:26,222 --> 00:12:29,322
and she has promised to bring us
a little bit of that Fifth Avenue flair...

85
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:31,099
to Bourbon Street, yes?

86
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:33,292
Sure.
Nice to meet you, Max.

87
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,370
You too.

88
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:37,316
You know, Max,
ladies love a man in uniform.

89
00:12:38,195 --> 00:12:43,395
Yeah, Dad, I'm sure the polyester pants
really help seal the deal.

90
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:49,132
And last but not least
I'd like to introduce you to Ryan P-

91
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:52,011
- What was your last name?
- Parker.

92
00:12:52,052 --> 00:12:55,252
I'm just kidding you. Ryan Parker,
our vice president in charge of operations.

93
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:56,567
- Good to meet you, Max.
- Likewise.

94
00:12:57,077 --> 00:13:00,597
Now while you're out there on your rounds,
you see something that doesn't look right...

95
00:13:00,598 --> 00:13:03,798
you got a problem
with plumbing or electric, fire...

96
00:13:03,801 --> 00:13:07,601
or you get a candy bar stuck
in the vending machine, you call Ryan.

97
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,119
That's after you call me.

98
00:13:12,738 --> 00:13:15,738
- Hey listen. I'm gonna let you go.
- I know you got a job to do.

99
00:13:15,824 --> 00:13:17,624
And we need to continue on our rounds. OK?

100
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,316
- Ok. 
 - Good luck out there.

101
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,760
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.

102
00:13:21,985 --> 00:13:23,385
Shall we?

103
00:14:47,277 --> 00:14:48,677
You all right?

104
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,970
Sorry. First night.

105
00:15:05,157 --> 00:15:08,657
So, Max, you say you've been
having those visions again?

106
00:15:08,893 --> 00:15:10,013
Yeah.

107
00:15:11,338 --> 00:15:15,338
Were you taking drugs or had you been
drinking when you had this episode?

108
00:15:15,951 --> 00:15:20,351
No. It was last night at my new job.

109
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:24,769
I saw a woman
in one of the mirrors at my work.

110
00:15:25,831 --> 00:15:27,651
You saw a woman?

111
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:32,183
Yeah. She was looking back at me
from the other side.

112
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:35,748
Her reflection looked like a corpse.

113
00:15:36,862 --> 00:15:39,662
She probably reminded you
of Kayla in some way.

114
00:15:41,215 --> 00:15:44,015
Your mind's way of
processing the mental shock.

115
00:15:45,415 --> 00:15:47,515
And the pills I prescribed?

116
00:15:48,236 --> 00:15:50,056
Yeah, I took one.

117
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,152
- That's all?
- Yeah.

118
00:15:53,378 --> 00:15:54,498
Good.

119
00:15:55,115 --> 00:15:57,915
I wanted to take more,
but I decided not to.

120
00:15:58,741 --> 00:16:00,141
Very good.

121
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,346
So should we put
the straitjacket on me now...

122
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,990
or should we wait until my time's up?

123
00:16:05,185 --> 00:16:07,285
I'm not worried about you, Max

124
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:09,261
- No?
- Not at all.

125
00:16:09,477 --> 00:16:12,277
What you're telling me,
it's a good thing.

126
00:16:12,914 --> 00:16:14,034
Yeah?

127
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:18,658
These representations of Kayla,
hallucinations or not...

128
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:22,607
are a sign that you're starting
to get your life back in order...

129
00:16:23,341 --> 00:16:28,241
that maybe you're starting to let go of
your misplaced guilt about her death...

130
00:16:29,034 --> 00:16:32,534
that you're ready to stop blaming yourself
for what happened.

131
00:16:34,006 --> 00:16:35,226
What intrigues me...

132
00:16:35,262 --> 00:16:38,762
is that now that you've stopped wallowing
in the drugs and the alcohol...

133
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:41,307
now that you're sober...

134
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:44,947
your mind is ready to begin
processing the tragedy in earnest.

135
00:16:49,128 --> 00:16:51,228
You wanna come see me again
next week...

136
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:54,049
get back to a regular
appointment type thing?

137
00:16:55,602 --> 00:16:56,722
Sure.

138
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:30,649
Uhum.
I'll run the numbers tomorrow.

139
00:17:30,748 --> 00:17:33,348
Okay. And then I'm gonna have the orders
for the size 8 through 12.

140
00:17:33,361 --> 00:17:35,461
- No. No!
- Why? But

141
00:17:35,741 --> 00:17:39,941
Look. It's like I told you earlier. I don't
want to order any of the larger sizes.

142
00:17:40,488 --> 00:17:41,588
But I don't.
Why, Jenna?

143
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:42,207
Why?

144
00:17:42,233 --> 00:17:45,733
Because this Mayflower has to convey
the message that it's a boutique.

145
00:17:46,022 --> 00:17:48,222
And boutique
implies skin and bones.

146
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,100
Yeah. Ok.  I'm really sure.
Right right. right. Okay.

147
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,045
So, if we do the research...

148
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,073
and it shows that the demographic
is full of heifers...

149
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,420
then we'll order accordingly.

150
00:17:58,467 --> 00:18:02,467
But listen to me- Until then, four is
the new eight. Do you understand me?

151
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:06,024
- Yeah, I got it.
- Thank you. Talk to you later.

152
00:20:10,856 --> 00:20:12,676
Camera in the bathroom?

153
00:20:21,066 --> 00:20:22,886
Henry, you dirty dog.

154
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:28,993
-Hey!
-Hey!

155
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:31,463
Just want to check in
on my new favorite employee.

156
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:34,987
I'm good. Just happy to be here,
Mr. Landreaux.

157
00:20:35,011 --> 00:20:36,711
Awww!. We're happy to have you, Max.

158
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:41,005
You know your dad entrusted me with the opening
of the new Mayflower as my top priority.

159
00:20:42,436 --> 00:20:45,236
You seem committed,
being here so late.

160
00:20:45,545 --> 00:20:49,045
Yeah. I can't let anything
interfere with our grand opening.

161
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,222
Yeah. I should do my rounds.

162
00:20:52,136 --> 00:20:54,236
Hey, Max,
will you do me a favor?

163
00:20:55,551 --> 00:20:59,051
Call me Keller.
We're all family here at the Mayflower.

164
00:21:00,607 --> 00:21:01,727
Okay.

165
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:19,475
Jenna?

166
00:23:19,841 --> 00:23:21,241
What are you-

167
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,200
No!

168
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:00,281
Fuck!

169
00:25:28,165 --> 00:25:29,985
Mornin', rookie.

170
00:25:30,314 --> 00:25:32,414
So, how did that last night go?

171
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,430
Everything all right?

172
00:25:38,859 --> 00:25:40,259
Hahahaha!

173
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:01,425
Dr. Beaumont's office.

174
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,940
Hi! This is Max Matheson. I need to see
Dr. Beaumont as soon as possible.

175
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,430
Okay, let me see what I have.

176
00:26:15,038 --> 00:26:17,138
How do you think this happened?

177
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:18,992
I don't know.

178
00:26:21,276 --> 00:26:24,076
Looks more like a-
just a terrible accident...

179
00:26:24,588 --> 00:26:26,688
but maybe someone killed her.

180
00:26:27,525 --> 00:26:29,625
Homicide by handmade guillotine?

181
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:33,364
That would impress even yours truly.

182
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:35,201
Yeah, me too, Pete.

183
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:36,872
Me too.

184
00:26:49,611 --> 00:26:51,711
- Dr. Beaumont?
- Yes?

185
00:26:53,464 --> 00:26:57,664
Do you really believe all that, your
explanation for what's happening to me?

186
00:26:58,122 --> 00:27:01,622
Well, of course.
There's really no other explanation.

187
00:27:02,314 --> 00:27:04,914
And the fact that it's
all related to the mirrors...

188
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,724
that that's how
I'm seeing these visions?

189
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,850
<i>Méconnaissance.</i>

190
00:27:09,936 --> 00:27:10,936
What's that?

191
00:27:11,032 --> 00:27:15,632
It's a French term from Jacques Lacan's
mirror stage of psychoanalytic theory.

192
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:19,169
The ego is a product
of false reflections.

193
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:21,011
<i>Méconnaissance-</i>

194
00:27:21,022 --> 00:27:24,522
when the subject is alienated
from his or her self.

195
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,237
In English?

196
00:27:29,319 --> 00:27:32,119
Nobody sees anything in a mirror...

197
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,300
that isn't simply a part of them...

198
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:37,191
not even things
they think they're seeing.

199
00:27:37,742 --> 00:27:41,242
Every culture has its own particular
myth set regarding mirrors.

200
00:27:41,958 --> 00:27:43,578
In Korea, for example...

201
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:48,202
it's believed that a person's soul
can be trapped inside of a mirror...

202
00:27:48,289 --> 00:27:50,109
as it leaves the body.

203
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:55,127
You've heard the old adage, a cracked
mirror brings seven years bad luck.

204
00:27:55,165 --> 00:27:57,965
And even here
in the South's recent past...

205
00:27:58,118 --> 00:28:02,118
it was not uncommon to cover
all of the mirrors in a house...

206
00:28:02,144 --> 00:28:05,244
where the wake of a deceased person
was being held.

207
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:08,090
There's even a clinical diagnosis...

208
00:28:08,116 --> 00:28:11,616
for an intense fear of mirrors
called spectrophobia.

209
00:28:13,073 --> 00:28:15,873
Lots of psychic baggage
in them there mirrors huh!

210
00:28:17,017 --> 00:28:19,317
So I guess
I'm doing pretty well, then?

211
00:28:19,329 --> 00:28:20,629
In light of all you've been through...

212
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:23,884
combined with all the superstitions
we hold regarding mirrors...

213
00:28:23,934 --> 00:28:26,734
I'd say you're doing
pretty good indeed.

214
00:29:23,033 --> 00:29:24,853
How are ya holdin' up?

215
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,319
Fine.

216
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:32,179
Your father didn't tell you.

217
00:29:33,091 --> 00:29:34,491
Tell me what?

218
00:29:34,612 --> 00:29:38,112
Jenna McCarty,
the woman you met the other day...

219
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:40,317
She died last night.

220
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:42,917
They found her in her apartment.

221
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,004
How did she die?

222
00:29:47,008 --> 00:29:49,508
The police said she fell through glass.

223
00:29:49,555 --> 00:29:51,375
It ripped her head off.

224
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:54,011
It was a horrible accident.

225
00:29:55,548 --> 00:29:57,368
Such a tragedy.

226
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,868
Hey! Are you all right?

227
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,690
Yeah. I'm... just surprised.

228
00:30:08,978 --> 00:30:10,378
You sure?

229
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:11,947
Yeah.

230
00:30:12,773 --> 00:30:15,573
- Will you call me if you need anything?
- Yeah.

231
00:30:18,097 --> 00:30:19,497
Thanks.

232
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:22,141
I still can't believe it.

233
00:30:55,203 --> 00:30:56,603
Hello?

234
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,570
Are you here? It's me.

235
00:31:18,475 --> 00:31:19,595
Hello?

236
00:31:26,503 --> 00:31:27,903
Oh, God.

237
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:31,508
I'm really starting to lose it again.

238
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:57,129
<i>"P." "P." Parker.</i>

239
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,320
What? What?

240
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,820
No!

241
00:35:15,624 --> 00:35:16,744
No!

242
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,103
No!

243
00:35:22,019 --> 00:35:23,139
NO!

244
00:35:59,703 --> 00:36:00,823
FUCK!

245
00:36:05,984 --> 00:36:07,804
Where's the number?

246
00:36:21,229 --> 00:36:22,349
God!

247
00:36:37,591 --> 00:36:38,711
God!

248
00:36:57,263 --> 00:36:58,963
Hi. You've reached Ryan's
answering machine.

249
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,499
I'm unable to get up
and get the phone right now...

250
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:03,301
so leave me a message with your name

251
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:06,239
- Come on, goddamn it.
- and your phone number... and I will get back to you shortly.

252
00:37:06,281 --> 00:37:08,101
Take care.

253
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:34,190
No! Nooooo!

254
00:38:31,162 --> 00:38:33,262
You ever seen a 10-56 like that?

255
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,512
I'm not sure.

256
00:38:36,671 --> 00:38:37,491
One thing I do know that

257
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:41,070
This is the second death of an employee
who worked at the Mayflower.

258
00:38:41,089 --> 00:38:44,589
The third, if you count the girl
who went missing two months ago.

259
00:38:57,871 --> 00:38:59,591
- Officer.
- Yes, sir.

260
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:02,474
The witnesses.
Where'd you put 'em?

261
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:07,266
Hey, Pic.

262
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:11,885
Check out the badge.

263
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:20,871
He's definitely a person of interest.

264
00:39:37,332 --> 00:39:38,452
Hello?

265
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:40,757
Yeah, hi, Dad.

266
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:44,959
What time is it?

267
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:47,110
Ahhh...I don't know. It's late.

268
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,810
What's going on, Max?

269
00:39:51,902 --> 00:39:54,702
I'm just, I'm calling
to let you know that I'm

270
00:39:55,606 --> 00:39:58,606
I'm gonna be quitting my job.

271
00:39:59,273 --> 00:40:00,793
Are you all right?

272
00:40:00,829 --> 00:40:02,649
No, not really.

273
00:40:04,651 --> 00:40:06,751
I can't keep working there.

274
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:10,094
It's too much.

275
00:40:11,744 --> 00:40:13,144
Too much?

276
00:40:13,446 --> 00:40:16,246
Yeah.
I think I'm seeing things again.

277
00:40:16,818 --> 00:40:18,338
I'm really sorry.

278
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:20,576
I don't care about the job.
Just-

279
00:40:20,616 --> 00:40:24,116
- I need to know that you're okay.
- Yeah.

280
00:40:26,802 --> 00:40:28,202
I'm okay.

281
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,149
Okay. Uhmm

282
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:36,512
Stop by tomorrow and drop off
your ID badge and all that, you know.

283
00:40:38,029 --> 00:40:41,529
Yeah, I will.
Thank you for understanding, Dad.

284
00:40:42,303 --> 00:40:44,203
Max, I'm your father...

285
00:40:44,216 --> 00:40:46,036
and I do support you.

286
00:40:46,714 --> 00:40:48,114
You know that.

287
00:40:48,185 --> 00:40:49,585
Yeah, I do.

288
00:40:49,979 --> 00:40:51,379
Okay.

289
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:53,248
Get some rest.

290
00:40:53,292 --> 00:40:54,412
Okay.

291
00:43:15,672 --> 00:43:16,792
Dad!

292
00:43:25,098 --> 00:43:26,218
Dad!

293
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:30,605
Max, what are you doing here?

294
00:43:31,641 --> 00:43:33,741
I know what I need to do.

295
00:43:36,097 --> 00:43:37,497
I came by-

296
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:38,500
uhm...

297
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:41,287
- I changed my mind.
- Good for you.

298
00:43:41,356 --> 00:43:43,456
I wanna stay at the Mayflower.

299
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:46,785
Come here.
Give me one.

300
00:43:48,286 --> 00:43:49,686
Thank you.

301
00:43:50,883 --> 00:43:52,703
It's gonna be okay.

302
00:43:53,061 --> 00:43:54,461
Yeah, I know.

303
00:43:55,664 --> 00:43:58,664
We don't know why things happen
the way that they do...

304
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:01,991
but they have a tendency
to work themselves out.

305
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,379
Everything happens for a reason, Max.

306
00:44:04,438 --> 00:44:05,838
Yeah. Right.

307
00:44:12,187 --> 00:44:14,007
Are you hungry?

308
00:44:16,196 --> 00:44:17,596
Want a slice?

309
00:44:17,803 --> 00:44:19,203
I'm good.

310
00:44:25,564 --> 00:44:26,684
Hey!

311
00:44:27,484 --> 00:44:31,284
- Can you hold up a sec?
- Just need a minute.

312
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:34,151
May I help you?

313
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:38,600
Detective Huston, Homicide.

314
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:41,476
Detective Piccirilli.
What he said.

315
00:44:42,390 --> 00:44:43,790
Homicide?

316
00:44:43,874 --> 00:44:45,674
We just come by to ask you
a few questions...

317
00:44:45,756 --> 00:44:47,656
about some fellow employees
at the Mayflower...

318
00:44:47,737 --> 00:44:51,937
see if you might know anything about 'em
that might be of interest to us.

319
00:44:51,946 --> 00:44:53,566
We went by your house.

320
00:44:53,648 --> 00:44:55,468
You weren't there.

321
00:44:56,963 --> 00:44:58,363
Okay. And?

322
00:44:59,323 --> 00:45:01,423
And... why don't you tell us.

323
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,640
Tell you what?

324
00:45:04,706 --> 00:45:07,506
You heard about one
Miss Jenna McCarty, correct?

325
00:45:09,788 --> 00:45:10,708
Yes.

326
00:45:10,802 --> 00:45:12,902
And you were also at the home...

327
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,800
of Mr. Ryan Parker earlier tonight,
weren't you?

328
00:45:18,923 --> 00:45:21,623
Yeah. But-

329
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,460
Then certainly you must have
gathered that he was dead, right?

330
00:45:24,516 --> 00:45:25,536
Right.

331
00:45:25,618 --> 00:45:28,418
Brutally murdered, as a matter of fact.

332
00:45:28,446 --> 00:45:30,266
Hence, homicide.

333
00:45:31,372 --> 00:45:33,192
Plural, actually, Pic.

334
00:45:34,463 --> 00:45:36,283
Homicides, with an S.

335
00:45:36,468 --> 00:45:38,088
You're right, man.

336
00:45:38,144 --> 00:45:40,244
There've been two homicides...

337
00:45:40,701 --> 00:45:43,001
involving employees
of the Mayflower this week.

338
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,139
Since you were
at the scene of the crime tonight-

339
00:45:45,185 --> 00:45:46,485
And in charge of security-

340
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:50,690
it stands to reason that you might have
an opinion or two about these matters.

341
00:45:56,264 --> 00:45:58,084
Am I a suspect?

342
00:46:03,236 --> 00:46:04,356
No.

343
00:46:04,668 --> 00:46:06,488
- Not yet.
- Not yet?

344
00:46:06,932 --> 00:46:08,752
Not officially.

345
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:11,021
What, not officially?

346
00:46:11,555 --> 00:46:13,655
At this point son the only thing
you're suspected of...

347
00:46:13,714 --> 00:46:17,214
is being a lousy security guard.

348
00:46:19,496 --> 00:46:24,996
So, why were you out front
of the deceased's home earlier tonight?

349
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:28,110
Kind of a creepy coincidence,
don't you think?

350
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:31,517
No.

351
00:46:33,014 --> 00:46:35,814
I don't think
it was a creepy coincidence.

352
00:46:36,173 --> 00:46:37,573
Not at all.

353
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:41,961
And I might be a lousy security guard,
but it seems to me that the two of you are...

354
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:44,789
not too much better
at the detective stuff.

355
00:46:46,067 --> 00:46:48,267
If you'd have done your homework,
you would've seen that...

356
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,671
Mr. Parker is
the vice president of operations...

357
00:46:50,709 --> 00:46:54,209
here at this particular branch
of the Mayflower Department Store.

358
00:46:54,475 --> 00:46:57,975
And per protocol,
if anything goes wrong, it is my duty...

359
00:46:58,174 --> 00:47:00,474
to contact Mr. Parker immediately.

360
00:47:01,346 --> 00:47:03,166
Why not just call him?

361
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:06,151
As soon as you stop badgering me
and you get back to your work...

362
00:47:06,234 --> 00:47:09,734
you'll be happy to see that the phone
records indicate that I did, in fact...

363
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,564
try to call Mr. Parker.

364
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:17,396
Probably, I might add, during the time at
which Mr. Parker was being, as you say...

365
00:47:17,443 --> 00:47:19,263
brutally murdered.

366
00:47:21,033 --> 00:47:24,533
Might be kind of hard for me
to have been the one killing him too.

367
00:47:24,962 --> 00:47:29,162
So you ran over
to the deceased's home...

368
00:47:29,497 --> 00:47:32,297
to let him know you were
having a problem with-

369
00:47:33,114 --> 00:47:34,934
With the mirrors.

370
00:47:41,395 --> 00:47:44,995
So unless there are any other questions,
I'd really like to get back to my work.

371
00:47:44,996 --> 00:47:47,896
- No more questions.
- For now.

372
00:47:48,489 --> 00:47:51,289
- We just wanted to stop by.
- Say hi.

373
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,359
And let you know that
we got our eye out on you.

374
00:47:57,649 --> 00:47:59,749
I feel so much safer knowing that.

375
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,941
Thank you very much, Detectives.

376
00:48:20,576 --> 00:48:22,396
I don't understand.

377
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,720
Who are you?

378
00:48:35,952 --> 00:48:37,772
What do you want?

379
00:50:04,047 --> 00:50:05,867
She worked here.

380
00:51:56,657 --> 00:52:00,157
- Hello?
- Hi. Is this Elizabeth Reigns?

381
00:52:11,081 --> 00:52:12,481
Hi. Elizabeth.

382
00:52:13,095 --> 00:52:14,495
Hi. I'm Max.

383
00:52:15,284 --> 00:52:16,404
Hi.

384
00:52:17,952 --> 00:52:22,152
So.. uh, You wanna talk about my sister?

385
00:52:22,636 --> 00:52:24,336
You said you might have some information.

386
00:52:24,411 --> 00:52:25,531
Yeah.

387
00:52:27,657 --> 00:52:32,557
I think maybe I've seen her recently.

388
00:52:32,628 --> 00:52:33,748
Wha- Where?

389
00:52:35,515 --> 00:52:37,335
At the Mayflower.

390
00:52:37,930 --> 00:52:39,750
Where at the Mayflower?

391
00:52:42,779 --> 00:52:44,599
In the mirrors.

392
00:52:46,725 --> 00:52:49,525
What- In the mirrors?
What do you mean, in the mirrors?

393
00:52:49,598 --> 00:52:52,798
Yeah, I know I know this, it sounds crazy...

394
00:52:52,815 --> 00:52:56,915
but I- I see her reflection
in the mirrors.

395
00:52:56,966 --> 00:53:01,366
And l-
Then I turn around and she's gone.

396
00:53:01,651 --> 00:53:03,471
She's not there anymore.

397
00:53:04,013 --> 00:53:06,613
I don't know
who put you up to this.

398
00:53:06,694 --> 00:53:10,594
My sister, my little sister Eleanor has
been missing for almost two months now.

399
00:53:10,649 --> 00:53:12,949
And you just turn this
into some kind of joke.

400
00:53:12,974 --> 00:53:16,694
No, Hey! it's not a joke.

401
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:20,349
Listen to me.

402
00:53:20,485 --> 00:53:23,285
- Listen, I'm serious.
- Don't touch me!

403
00:53:25,018 --> 00:53:26,838
Just don't touch me.

404
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:29,797
I know what I said, it sounds crazy.

405
00:53:31,865 --> 00:53:33,685
It's the truth.

406
00:53:35,497 --> 00:53:38,997
So this started happening the first night
that you were working there?

407
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:42,160
How can that be?

408
00:53:42,235 --> 00:53:45,335
How is it that out of everyone
that works there...

409
00:53:45,390 --> 00:53:48,190
you're the only one
that can see my sister?

410
00:53:49,365 --> 00:53:53,665
A year ago,
I was driving with my fiancée.

411
00:54:12,049 --> 00:54:13,169
Hey!

412
00:54:15,079 --> 00:54:16,199
What?

413
00:54:16,871 --> 00:54:18,271
Nothin'.

414
00:54:21,803 --> 00:54:22,923
Okay.

415
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,529
Hey! uh-
 Can you reach into the backpack,

416
00:54:29,567 --> 00:54:30,787
grab my phone for me?

417
00:54:30,820 --> 00:54:33,820
- Yeah.
- I need to call my dad.

418
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,237
Okay, hang on. Drive safe.

419
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:39,419
- Okay, Max?
- Yeah. I got it.

420
00:54:39,638 --> 00:54:41,738
- Please. Thank you.
- I can see.

421
00:54:41,741 --> 00:54:43,141
Perfectly?

422
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:46,159
- Come on, I'm a great driver.
- Yeah.

423
00:54:46,838 --> 00:54:47,958
Okay.

424
00:54:49,681 --> 00:54:51,381
Where did you say it was?

425
00:54:51,881 --> 00:54:53,701
In the front there.

426
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,028
Front. Front.

427
00:54:58,434 --> 00:55:01,234
- Are you sure?
- Honey, it's right there.

428
00:55:10,892 --> 00:55:12,292
Any luck?

429
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,599
Oh, my God.

430
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:20,822
Max Matheson,
is this what I think it is?

431
00:55:21,376 --> 00:55:24,176
- Well, what do you think it is?
- I don't know.

432
00:55:54,595 --> 00:55:56,415
A drunk driver.

433
00:55:57,169 --> 00:55:58,569
He hit you?

434
00:55:58,649 --> 00:56:01,069
I swerved to avoid him.

435
00:56:01,075 --> 00:56:03,875
I wrapped my car
around a telephone pole.

436
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,328
Technically, it was my fault.

437
00:56:08,694 --> 00:56:10,514
And your fiancée, she-

438
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:13,450
she died in the accident?

439
00:56:15,701 --> 00:56:17,101
We both did.

440
00:58:14,215 --> 00:58:15,615
Start an IV.

441
00:58:16,406 --> 00:58:18,226
Stay still, sir.

442
00:58:28,758 --> 00:58:30,578
They brought you back.

443
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:36,183
Maybe I brought back
something with me...

444
00:58:36,197 --> 00:58:40,797
some ability to see
the other side or something.

445
00:58:45,038 --> 00:58:48,438
Afterward, I just got pretty
screwed up for a while-

446
00:58:48,445 --> 00:58:50,065
drugs, alcohol...

447
00:58:50,162 --> 00:58:52,262
whatever I could put into me.

448
00:58:53,672 --> 00:58:57,172
Like I was trying to get
closer to her or something.

449
00:58:57,263 --> 00:59:00,063
- Wasn't your fault.
- I was the one driving.

450
00:59:00,082 --> 00:59:04,282
You were trying to swerve to get out
of the way. You were trying to save her.

451
00:59:06,574 --> 00:59:08,394
Yeah, but I couldn't.

452
00:59:09,669 --> 00:59:11,489
I couldn't save her.

453
00:59:12,489 --> 00:59:14,589
You wanted to see her again.

454
00:59:15,946 --> 00:59:18,746
Yeah. More than you could ever know.

455
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:28,144
How long's your sister been missing?

456
00:59:29,181 --> 00:59:31,001
About two months.

457
00:59:32,834 --> 00:59:34,934
And you still think she's-

458
00:59:36,594 --> 00:59:37,714
Dead?

459
00:59:43,054 --> 00:59:47,254
Of course, the cops say that young women
up and leave all the time to start new lives.

460
00:59:51,228 --> 00:59:53,048
But Eleanor and I...

461
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:56,675
we weren't just sisters, we were
best friends, we were soul mates.

462
00:59:57,684 --> 00:59:59,684
And the night that she...

463
00:59:59,766 --> 01:00:01,166
disappeared...

464
01:00:02,569 --> 01:00:06,969
I woke up from a deep sleep,
screaming for no reason.

465
01:00:08,311 --> 01:00:11,811
My heart was beating so fast,
I thought it was gonna explode.

466
01:00:13,944 --> 01:00:16,044
I knew right then and there.

467
01:00:18,345 --> 01:00:21,845
What was your sister doing
the day she disappeared?

468
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,344
Working at the Mayflower.

469
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:30,013
There was some sort of party that night
and she was- she'd just been hired on.

470
01:00:30,082 --> 01:00:32,882
They were having
a groundbreaking celebration.

471
01:00:44,476 --> 01:00:46,896
I gotta get to work.

472
01:00:47,528 --> 01:00:51,028
Yeah, I gotta get some sleep.
I gotta work again tonight.

473
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:54,261
Call me if anything else comes up.

474
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,640
Absolutely.

475
01:00:57,293 --> 01:00:59,113
Thank you, Max.

476
01:01:01,564 --> 01:01:04,864
I haven't done anything.
Not yet, anyway.

477
01:01:05,414 --> 01:01:07,234
But you're trying.

478
01:01:07,937 --> 01:01:11,437
That's more than anyone else
has been willing to do around here.

479
01:01:54,918 --> 01:01:56,318
Eleanor.

480
01:01:59,727 --> 01:02:01,547
I'm trying my best.

481
01:02:02,101 --> 01:02:04,201
I'm trying my best. Really.

482
01:02:10,506 --> 01:02:14,226
Please. Stop doing this.

483
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,100
Wait. What are you doing?

484
01:02:24,457 --> 01:02:26,857
Please, don't- don't do this.

485
01:02:27,914 --> 01:02:29,034
Please.

486
01:02:30,319 --> 01:02:31,439
No.

487
01:02:31,754 --> 01:02:36,354
Tell me what I need to do.
Please, tell me. Just-

488
01:02:36,620 --> 01:02:39,340
What is it? What?

489
01:03:09,799 --> 01:03:10,499
Hello.

490
01:03:10,579 --> 01:03:12,099
-Hey!
-Hey!

491
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,200
What night did she disappear?

492
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:16,632
It was a Wednesday night.

493
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:18,819
What was the specific date?

494
01:03:19,118 --> 01:03:20,318
How come?

495
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,570
Well, it's a long shot,
but I thought maybe...

496
01:03:23,572 --> 01:03:27,072
if something happened to Eleanor while
she was working here at the Mayflower...

497
01:03:27,114 --> 01:03:29,914
maybe the security cameras
caught something.

498
01:03:30,479 --> 01:03:33,779
uh- It was a Wednesday, September 2

499
01:03:39,137 --> 01:03:40,537
The 22nd.

500
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,932
It's not here.

501
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:50,800
What?

502
01:03:50,874 --> 01:03:52,594
It's missing.

503
01:03:52,661 --> 01:03:54,461
- Missing?
- Yup.

504
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,310
Somebody erased it.

505
01:03:56,845 --> 01:03:59,645
- Who?
- Well, give me a minute.

506
01:04:01,339 --> 01:04:05,139
Yeah, last viewed September 24.

507
01:04:05,603 --> 01:04:07,703
Two days after she disappeared.

508
01:04:08,365 --> 01:04:11,565
Who was the last person
to view those files?

509
01:04:11,631 --> 01:04:15,431
Yeah, last viewed,
Henry David Schow.

510
01:04:15,494 --> 01:04:16,294
Who's that?

511
01:04:16,381 --> 01:04:21,581
He's the security guard I replaced.
The guy cut himself up and then quit.

512
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:24,165
They say he's gone totally crazy.

513
01:04:24,208 --> 01:04:27,008
All after my sister went missing.

514
01:04:27,302 --> 01:04:29,122
Can you pick me up?

515
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:45,480
Henry Schow?

516
01:04:47,081 --> 01:04:48,901
Henry, you in there?

517
01:04:51,722 --> 01:04:55,222
- Henry, is that you?
- Stay away from me.

518
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:58,168
Hey! Come on.
Henry, open the door.

519
01:04:58,962 --> 01:05:01,062
Henry!

520
01:05:02,449 --> 01:05:04,169
I said stay away.

521
01:05:04,219 --> 01:05:07,719
Henry, we're not here to hurt you.
We just wanna ask you a couple questions.

522
01:05:07,724 --> 01:05:09,124
That's all.

523
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,309
Don't shut- Henry!

524
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:16,230
Who are you?

525
01:05:16,346 --> 01:05:20,546
I'm your replacement at the Mayflower.
I'm the new night security guard.

526
01:05:22,643 --> 01:05:24,463
You've seen her then?

527
01:05:26,038 --> 01:05:27,238
Seen who?

528
01:05:27,337 --> 01:05:28,457
Her.

529
01:05:31,378 --> 01:05:32,778
Eleanor.

530
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,540
What do you know about Eleanor?

531
01:05:36,719 --> 01:05:38,819
Nothin'. I don't know nothin'.

532
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:41,026
Henry, you don't have to lie to us.

533
01:05:41,085 --> 01:05:45,985
- I'm not lying!
- Yes, you are! What are you hiding? huh!

534
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:48,549
She wants to kill me.

535
01:05:50,945 --> 01:05:53,745
Why does my sister want to kill you?

536
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:56,364
Your sister?

537
01:06:06,385 --> 01:06:08,485
Henry! Henry!

538
01:06:11,643 --> 01:06:15,543
Henry, did you kill my sister?

539
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:23,150
No. I don't know
what happened to her.

540
01:06:26,655 --> 01:06:28,655
But why do you think
she wants to kill you?

541
01:06:28,687 --> 01:06:30,087
I don't know.

542
01:06:30,811 --> 01:06:32,631
What about the files?

543
01:06:34,041 --> 01:06:35,041
What files?

544
01:06:35,088 --> 01:06:36,788
The digitized security camera files.

545
01:06:36,847 --> 01:06:38,947
The one from the night
she went missing.

546
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:41,113
The ones you erased, Henry.

547
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:45,517
I was just following orders!

548
01:06:45,989 --> 01:06:48,789
Henry, who told you
to erase those files?

549
01:06:49,063 --> 01:06:51,163
Mr. Landreaux, Keller Landreaux...

550
01:06:51,736 --> 01:06:54,136
asked me to get rid of 'em,
said it was important.

551
01:06:54,167 --> 01:06:57,567
- Keller.
- That's when your sister first showed up.

552
01:06:57,652 --> 01:06:59,052
That night.

553
01:06:59,311 --> 01:07:02,111
That's when she started
haunting all my mirrors.

554
01:07:02,892 --> 01:07:05,192
Henry, there's something
you're not telling us.

555
01:07:05,260 --> 01:07:06,780
I told you everything.

556
01:07:06,838 --> 01:07:09,938
Henry, now, my sister
went missing the next day.

557
01:07:09,999 --> 01:07:12,699
And somebody asked you to erase
those security files from the cameras...

558
01:07:12,726 --> 01:07:15,126
and you didn't think that
was a little bit suspicious?

559
01:07:15,155 --> 01:07:17,955
No, no, I didn't.
I didn't think that. I-

560
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:22,484
I just didn't wanna know.

561
01:07:22,773 --> 01:07:26,973
Henry, you need to tell us everything
that happened that night. Everything.

562
01:07:29,194 --> 01:07:31,394
I just want her to leave me alone.

563
01:07:31,439 --> 01:07:34,939
She's not gonna stop this
until she gets what she wants.

564
01:07:34,999 --> 01:07:37,099
Until she gets the truth, Henry!

565
01:07:38,031 --> 01:07:39,851
I don't know the truth.

566
01:07:40,740 --> 01:07:45,040
Keller threatened my job, so I just-
I went along with him.

567
01:07:45,830 --> 01:07:47,650
We were in the basement.

568
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:50,458
He said we had to erase the files

569
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:54,051
I'm sorry!

570
01:07:54,145 --> 01:07:55,545
The basement.

571
01:07:57,216 --> 01:08:00,716
We have to go back to the Mayflower.
We have to check the basement.

572
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:04,767
Basement.

573
01:08:07,626 --> 01:08:09,026
I'm sorry!

574
01:09:38,940 --> 01:09:40,340
What is it?

575
01:09:41,691 --> 01:09:43,791
There's rust on the ground.

576
01:09:47,968 --> 01:09:50,768
I think it came from that.
It's been moved.

577
01:09:54,943 --> 01:09:56,763
Give me a hand?

578
01:10:13,021 --> 01:10:14,841
It's a crawl space.

579
01:11:14,143 --> 01:11:15,963
You okay in there?

580
01:11:17,873 --> 01:11:20,873
- Max?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

581
01:11:34,783 --> 01:11:37,583
Don't say a word
or you're both dead.

582
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:57,810
I'm gonna be right back.

583
01:12:02,488 --> 01:12:05,308
Max, we need to talk.

584
01:12:22,414 --> 01:12:23,814
Just come out.

585
01:12:24,151 --> 01:12:25,271
Max!

586
01:12:26,542 --> 01:12:29,562
- Max, He's got a gun.
- Oh shit.

587
01:12:31,761 --> 01:12:32,881
Fuck!

588
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,799
Really need to loosen that one up.

589
01:12:54,177 --> 01:12:56,777
Look out, world.
Jenna McCarty's up to her old tricks.

590
01:12:56,820 --> 01:13:00,320
Now, now. The only way to keep
the new hires under your thumb...

591
01:13:00,548 --> 01:13:03,048
is to make sure
you have dirt on them.

592
01:13:03,102 --> 01:13:06,902
And nothing commands more respect
than knowing that you..

593
01:13:06,979 --> 01:13:12,379
have made a complete and total asshole
of yourself in front of the higher-ups.

594
01:13:13,897 --> 01:13:15,297
You're bad.

595
01:13:18,255 --> 01:13:20,155
- So where you from originally?
- So anyway-

596
01:13:20,190 --> 01:13:23,090
- There's the guy right there.
- Here you go, miss.

597
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,748
You know that girl right there?
She's in accounting?

598
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:30,648
uhmm... I've seen her before, but I haven't
really met that many people yet, so-

599
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:31,800
And what about you?

600
01:13:31,854 --> 01:13:34,554
I'm in operations, so,
pretty much the day-to-day stuff.

601
01:13:34,623 --> 01:13:36,023
Oh! Okay!

602
01:13:37,563 --> 01:13:39,263
- I think she's got something for you.
- Hey!

603
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:41,719
-Oh!  Thank you.
- You're welcome. You're drinking water right?

604
01:13:41,754 --> 01:13:44,554
- Yes. I've been so thirsty.
- Driving.

605
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:20,021
Elizabeth!

606
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,160
Help!

607
01:14:22,297 --> 01:14:25,797
Look, I didn't wanna hurt your sister!
I don't wanna hurt you!

608
01:14:26,783 --> 01:14:30,183
Why are you making me do this?
Why won't you listen to me!

609
01:14:30,240 --> 01:14:31,640
Get off me!

610
01:14:38,126 --> 01:14:39,526
What the fuck?

611
01:14:44,178 --> 01:14:45,578
What the fuck?

612
01:14:51,921 --> 01:14:53,741
Honey, are you okay?

613
01:14:54,065 --> 01:14:55,665
- I just-
- What happened?

614
01:14:55,727 --> 01:14:57,827
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, boss.

615
01:14:58,071 --> 01:14:59,771
She's, you know, been drinking.

616
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:03,356
Oh, no. Looks like somebody
had a little too much to drink.

617
01:15:05,745 --> 01:15:08,945
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Keller's gonna take you home, sweetie.

618
01:15:09,007 --> 01:15:12,507
Yeah, that won't be a problem.
Here, come here, baby. Here.

619
01:15:12,969 --> 01:15:15,069
- Just get her arm.
- There we go.

620
01:15:15,148 --> 01:15:16,348
- You'll be fine.
- There we go.

621
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:20,430
You'll be fine.
Just drink a lot of water.

622
01:15:22,194 --> 01:15:23,594
Have fun.

623
01:15:25,835 --> 01:15:26,735
Want a shot?

624
01:15:26,759 --> 01:15:29,279
- Yes, please.
- Two.

625
01:15:31,559 --> 01:15:34,659
- I left my purse at work.
- Okay, we'll go back. No problem.

626
01:15:34,742 --> 01:15:36,142
My keys.

627
01:15:37,485 --> 01:15:38,605
Wait.

628
01:15:39,878 --> 01:15:40,598
Wait.

629
01:15:40,645 --> 01:15:43,445
- Where are we going?
- There you go.

630
01:15:49,080 --> 01:15:51,880
I'm gonna get you home
safe and sound.

631
01:15:52,543 --> 01:15:54,363
I have to go home?

632
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:13,565
And here we are.
Let's get your keys and get you home.

633
01:16:16,291 --> 01:16:18,111
I just feel so-

634
01:16:46,684 --> 01:16:50,284
- No, no, no.
- Get off me!

635
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:53,236
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Stop it

636
01:16:56,924 --> 01:16:58,044
Heey!

637
01:17:07,493 --> 01:17:12,293
We need to talk about this!
Eleanor, we need to talk about this!

638
01:17:14,101 --> 01:17:16,901
Eleanor! Where are you going?
Come here!

639
01:17:17,485 --> 01:17:19,585
I just wanna talk to you!

640
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:30,326
I just wanna talk to you!

641
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,735
Eleanor!

642
01:17:42,284 --> 01:17:43,404
What?

643
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:50,644
Help! Max!

644
01:17:57,160 --> 01:17:58,280
Stop!

645
01:18:00,138 --> 01:18:02,958
Don't move, bitch.

646
01:18:03,676 --> 01:18:06,476
- Why are you doing this?
- Shut up!

647
01:18:07,498 --> 01:18:09,598
I can't let this happen.

648
01:18:10,857 --> 01:18:11,977
Walk!

649
01:18:25,384 --> 01:18:27,484
I just wanna talk to you!

650
01:18:29,552 --> 01:18:30,952
Eleanor!

651
01:18:34,447 --> 01:18:37,247
I swear to Christ,
I'm not gonna hurt you!

652
01:18:41,096 --> 01:18:42,916
I just wanna talk.

653
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:47,050
I just think you're
a little confused, that's all.

654
01:18:47,056 --> 01:18:48,456
Eleanor!

655
01:19:22,033 --> 01:19:24,033
Get down there, Eleanor!

656
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:27,120
- Eleanor?
- I just want to talk.

657
01:19:27,352 --> 01:19:29,452
You're gonna ruin everything!

658
01:19:30,808 --> 01:19:32,628
Get off of me!

659
01:19:37,944 --> 01:19:40,044
This is your fault, Eleanor!

660
01:19:40,858 --> 01:19:42,958
All you had to do was talk to me!

661
01:20:12,664 --> 01:20:13,784
Fuck.

662
01:20:24,728 --> 01:20:26,548
I'm so stupid!

663
01:20:29,057 --> 01:20:29,377
I'm so stupid!

664
01:20:29,439 --> 01:20:31,359
Help! Get off-

665
01:20:31,783 --> 01:20:33,183
Get off me!

666
01:20:35,309 --> 01:20:36,429
Max!

667
01:20:36,804 --> 01:20:37,904
Elizabeth!

668
01:20:37,985 --> 01:20:39,105
Help! Get off me.

669
01:20:39,639 --> 01:20:40,759
Please! Sto-

670
01:20:54,680 --> 01:20:56,500
Get back, Elizabeth!

671
01:20:58,812 --> 01:21:00,632
Drop it, Keller.

672
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:18,630
Eleanor!

673
01:21:30,542 --> 01:21:32,362
It's over, Keller.

674
01:21:44,681 --> 01:21:46,081
Oh, my God!

675
01:22:36,917 --> 01:22:38,317
It's over.

676
01:22:46,528 --> 01:22:48,348
We did it, Max.

677
01:23:18,113 --> 01:23:20,013
So let me get this straight.

678
01:23:20,015 --> 01:23:22,815
So even after you helped
Keller Landreaux...

679
01:23:23,497 --> 01:23:26,297
cover up the crawl space hole
with a furnace...

680
01:23:26,681 --> 01:23:30,181
and erase all the digital files
from the security cameras...

681
01:23:30,847 --> 01:23:34,347
you didn't think something was,
I don't know...

682
01:23:34,405 --> 01:23:35,805
fishy?

683
01:23:38,434 --> 01:23:40,254
No, sir, I didn't.

684
01:23:46,669 --> 01:23:49,469
But you'd heard the girl went missing.

685
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:51,399
Yes, sir, I did.

686
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:58,050
And you're willing to sign a confession
admitting everything you've told us?

687
01:24:01,250 --> 01:24:02,370
Yes.

688
01:24:02,552 --> 01:24:04,172
Which you understand...

689
01:24:04,193 --> 01:24:05,893
will be admitting to your role...

690
01:24:05,924 --> 01:24:09,424
in the conspiracy to cover up
the murder of Eleanor Reigns.

691
01:24:20,926 --> 01:24:23,026
What say we get this man a pen.

692
01:24:24,678 --> 01:24:27,478
You took the words
right out of my mouth, Pic.

693
01:24:43,166 --> 01:24:45,266
Okay, what gives, Pete?

694
01:24:46,497 --> 01:24:48,897
That was the easiest
interrogation ever.

695
01:24:48,908 --> 01:24:50,528
I don't know, Pic.

696
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:54,080
First time I ever played
good cop, good cop though

697
01:24:58,919 --> 01:25:00,739
Must be some catch.

698
01:25:00,912 --> 01:25:02,732
Always a catch.

699
01:25:55,187 --> 01:25:57,007
Hello, Eleanor.

699
01:25:58,305 --> 01:26:58,385
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
