<i>If I could reach the
top of the world</i>

3
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,063
<i>Be all I am It'd be so beautiful</i>

4
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:33,570
<i>If only I could be brave
and I could be strong</i>

5
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:35,554
<i>I would know where I belong</i>

6
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,058
<i>If only</i>

7
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:43,121
<i>I wanna feel free to be who I am</i>

8
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:46,774
<i>What I'm about is
more than I've been</i>

9
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,318
<i>Ready to show the world who I am</i>

10
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,461
Oh!

11
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:53,197
A little bit of sun.

12
00:01:53,198 --> 00:01:54,299
Oh, look!

13
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:56,217
Hey, Zarina!

14
00:01:58,703 --> 00:01:59,929
Oh.

15
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:03,207
Out of pixie dust again, sug?

16
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,643
You know me, Rosetta.

17
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:09,439
I could give you some tips
on conserving your supply.

18
00:02:11,132 --> 00:02:13,818
I may just take you
up on that, Dessa.

19
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:21,367
A Dust Keeper Fairy
who's always out of pixie dust.

20
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,369
Ironic, isn't it?

21
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,961
Right there. Nice. Okay.

22
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:34,172
Rinse time!

23
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:36,507
Time to dry!

24
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:40,511
Hey, Z! Wings okay?

25
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:43,431
Just enjoying a stroll.
But thanks, Fawn.

26
00:02:43,498 --> 00:02:44,849
Nice wind, Vidia.

27
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:47,810
Thanks. What's a "stroll"?

28
00:02:49,254 --> 00:02:50,605
Oh, no!

29
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,800
<i>So I could be who I am</i>

30
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:56,903
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

31
00:02:57,554 --> 00:03:00,597
<i>I'm closer to where I'm meant to be</i>

32
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:04,184
<i>If I try I know that
I can get there</i>

33
00:03:04,185 --> 00:03:07,372
<i>I'm not gonna stop 'cause I believe</i>

34
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,876
<i>That there's so much more to me</i>

35
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,488
<i>So much more</i>

36
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:23,537
<i>I wanna feel free to be who I am</i>

37
00:03:23,538 --> 00:03:26,957
<i>What I'm about is
more than I've been</i>

38
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:30,103
<i>Ready to show the world who I am</i>

39
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:33,523
<i>Started it out, but I'm holding in</i>

40
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:36,592
<i>Find my own place to stay</i>

41
00:03:36,593 --> 00:03:38,569
<i>So I can be who I am</i>

42
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:39,737
Uh...

43
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:44,117
We put the dust in the bags
and they stay there, right?

44
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,895
And yet, we sprinkle dust
on top of something,

45
00:03:47,896 --> 00:03:49,313
and it floats.

46
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,460
Well, that's just how
pixie dust works.

47
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,631
Well, yes, I know,
but "Why?" is the question.

48
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,592
Know what I mean?

49
00:04:01,868 --> 00:04:03,553
Not even a little?

50
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,847
Never once had the thought?

51
00:04:06,456 --> 00:04:07,497
Good morning,

52
00:04:07,498 --> 00:04:08,790
- Dust Keepers!
- Oh!

53
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:10,667
Good morning, Fairy Gary!

54
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,562
All right, let's see.

55
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:16,482
On blue dust duty
today we have, uh...

56
00:04:16,674 --> 00:04:18,401
- What were we on?
- "Y."

57
00:04:18,426 --> 00:04:20,802
Ah! Yes. Yvette.

58
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,846
Yvette is out for the
day, Fairy Gary.

59
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:25,140
Dust-Keeper elbow flared up again.

60
00:04:25,141 --> 00:04:27,076
That's fantastic!

61
00:04:30,271 --> 00:04:33,624
I mean, poor, poor Yvette.

62
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,462
Well, um, that brings us to...

63
00:04:41,824 --> 00:04:44,302
Zarina, you're up!

64
00:04:46,204 --> 00:04:47,555
Uh-oh.

65
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,641
Can you believe it?
I mean, one day early.

66
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,000
It's so exciting!

67
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,603
Uh... Six clicks to the right.

68
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,563
Yes, thank you.

69
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,486
- Wow.
- Careful, now!

70
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,137
After last time,
I'm sure I don't have to remind you

71
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:05,555
just how potent and powerful...

72
00:05:05,556 --> 00:05:08,493
- No touching, I promise.
- Attagirl!

73
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:12,354
All right, then. Exactly 26 specks.

74
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,831
But why 26?

75
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:16,316
- And here we go.
- Why not 25?

76
00:05:16,317 --> 00:05:19,236
What would happen
if we put in, say, 27?

77
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:21,923
- We put in 26.
- But why?

78
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:26,284
Ah, Zarina, you're the most
inquisitive fairy I've ever known.

79
00:05:26,285 --> 00:05:28,179
Correction, it's a tie.

80
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:31,832
Let's just say, you're the
Tinker Bell of Dust Keepers.

81
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:34,001
But why do you say it
like it's a bad thing?

82
00:05:34,002 --> 00:05:36,979
Because we don't work
with twigs and acorn caps.

83
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,900
We work with pixie dust.
It's our lifeblood.

84
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:43,194
There's no room for error.

85
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,750
Blue dust.

86
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,629
One of nature's
mightiest multipliers.

87
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:06,592
It takes the golden dust
from a trickle to a roar.

88
00:06:07,869 --> 00:06:12,598
No matter how many times
I see it, just... Wow!

89
00:06:12,665 --> 00:06:14,142
Indeed.

90
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,961
Okay, but if there's blue dust,
why can't there be other colors?

91
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:19,212
Because there aren't.

92
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:22,132
And maybe those other colors
do other things.

93
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:25,927
What if there was,
I don't know, purple?

94
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:27,530
What if there's pink?

95
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,349
The day someone finds
pink pixie dust

96
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:34,704
is the day I trade in
my kilt for trousers.

97
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,748
Well, what if we don't find it?
What if we make it?

98
00:06:38,483 --> 00:06:40,376
Listen carefully, Zarina.

99
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,588
We do not tamper with pixie dust.

100
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:45,464
It is far too powerful.

101
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,865
But if we don't,

102
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,992
we'll never fully understand
what it's capable of.

103
00:06:48,993 --> 00:06:51,846
That is not our job.
We're Dust Keepers.

104
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,808
We nurture the dust, maintain it,

105
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:57,935
measure it, package it,

106
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:00,188
and distribute it.

107
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:04,341
A beautiful tradition,
day in, day out,

108
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:06,444
passed from one generation...

109
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:10,323
- ...to the next, to the next, to the next.
- Oh!

110
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,286
- Oh! Ahh!
- Oh, no!

111
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,871
Fairy Gary!

112
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:19,165
Are you okay?

113
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:22,460
Technically, I didn't
touch it this time.

114
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,170
The cap?

115
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:29,717
Let me be absolutely clear, Zarina.

116
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:34,055
Dust Keepers are forbidden
to tamper with pixie dust.

117
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,992
Hmm.

118
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,163
No result.

119
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,916
No result. No result.

120
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,710
No result. Ugh!

121
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,674
Huh?

122
00:08:16,914 --> 00:08:18,099
Hmm.

123
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:21,727
Two parts sunflower seed,
a dash of moonflower.

124
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:47,920
Huh.

125
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:01,267
It worked!

126
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,837
Oh! Hey, Zarina!

127
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,380
- What brings you...
- Tinker Bell...

128
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,506
- ...here?
- Remember how you were

129
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:09,716
the first one to use lost things,

130
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,635
and everyone thought
you were kind of crazy?

131
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:13,970
I believe Fairy Mary
called them "junk."

132
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:18,117
Exactly! But now, even she uses them
and tinkering is better than ever.

133
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:19,226
Well, that's nice of...

134
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:20,977
And remember how you crossed
the Winter border

135
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,395
when you knew it wasn't allowed,

136
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:24,147
but you just had to anyway?

137
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:27,001
I like to think it was
more of a grey area.

138
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:29,795
- Good. Now, keep that in mind.
- Whoa!

139
00:09:31,656 --> 00:09:32,864
You...

140
00:09:32,865 --> 00:09:36,969
You're bending light.
You're bending light?

141
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:40,205
But you're not a Light Fairy.
You're a Dust Keeper.

142
00:09:40,206 --> 00:09:41,891
Amazing, right?

143
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,517
Uh, but, how?

144
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,545
Whoa!
You found orange pixie dust?

145
00:09:47,546 --> 00:09:50,941
No, Tink. I made
orange pixie dust.

146
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,652
That's never been done before.

147
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:57,114
Exactly! I knew you'd understand.

148
00:09:57,473 --> 00:10:01,535
Now, I can finally figure out
everything pixie dust is capable of.

149
00:10:01,602 --> 00:10:03,853
Oh, what does Fairy Gary
think about all this?

150
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:04,980
Uh...

151
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:08,000
- He doesn't exactly know.
- What?

152
00:10:08,067 --> 00:10:10,795
He doesn't really think
we should tamper with pixie dust.

153
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,881
- Do you mind stirring?
- Uh, okay.

154
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,134
I guess he thinks it's
just too powerful.

155
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,261
- Oh! You can't stop.
- Oh! Uh...

156
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,915
Is that blue dust?

157
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,792
You're doing this with blue dust?

158
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,794
Yes, and it just takes
the tiniest bit.

159
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,230
Can you believe it?

160
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:30,981
- Back up a little.
- Uh...

161
00:10:32,091 --> 00:10:33,484
Huh.

162
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:39,490
- Wow.
- Purple pixie dust.

163
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,536
Wind!

164
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:49,482
Purple equals fast-flying talent!

165
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,984
Huh.

166
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:52,235
Uh...

167
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:54,338
- Garden talent next!
- Uh...

168
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,989
- Zarina?
- Pink pixie dust...

169
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,658
Maybe you should, you know,
slow down a bit.

170
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:01,095
Five pieces of petal
for every three drops of extract.

171
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:05,808
- Uh, should it be bubbling like that?
- Mmm-hmm.

172
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:13,256
Two? This time you're adding two?

173
00:11:13,257 --> 00:11:14,924
Uh-huh.

174
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,654
Zarina! Are you okay?

175
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:23,033
Tinker Fairy Gary some trousers,
because I just made pink pixie dust.

176
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,828
Zarina, this seems
kind of dangerous.

177
00:11:25,895 --> 00:11:29,498
Do you know what this means, Tink?
I've finally found my "lost things."

178
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:31,191
Dust-keeping will change forever!

179
00:11:31,192 --> 00:11:32,776
Zarina, I really think
you should stop!

180
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,712
What?

181
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,019
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no.

182
00:11:51,087 --> 00:11:52,837
Whoa! Look out!

183
00:12:02,306 --> 00:12:03,491
Huh?

184
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,038
Oh, no!

185
00:12:09,688 --> 00:12:11,248
No!

186
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,001
OW! Oh!

187
00:12:15,319 --> 00:12:17,129
Oh, no!

188
00:12:17,488 --> 00:12:18,589
Whoa!

189
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:38,526
Huh?

190
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:43,614
No...

191
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,782
Hmm?

192
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,665
Oh!

193
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,333
How did this happen?

194
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,170
Oh, no!

195
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,280
What happened?

196
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,365
- Tink, are you okay?
- Oh, my.

197
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:04,534
- Yeah.
- Who grew these?

198
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:13,585
I'm so sorry. I'll help
rebuild the depot.

199
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:15,086
I'll come in early, I'll stay late!

200
00:13:15,087 --> 00:13:19,316
You were told not
to tamper with pixie dust.

201
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:23,571
I think it's best
if you don't come in at all.

202
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,408
What are you saying?

203
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,995
You are no longer a Dust Keeper.

204
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:34,915
It's simply too dangerous.

205
00:13:37,109 --> 00:13:40,045
We'll start rebuilding in
the morning, Queen Clarion.

206
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:44,300
<i>Welcome one, welcome all</i>

207
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,737
<i>to the Four Seasons Festival!</i>

208
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:48,721
<i>Tonight, every talent</i>

209
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,890
<i>from every season
will gather together</i>

210
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:54,203
<i>to celebrate all the realms
of Pixie Hollow.</i>

211
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,145
Wow! Can you believe it?

212
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:58,106
Everyone in Pixie Hollow is here!

213
00:14:58,107 --> 00:15:01,025
It's so great to have
the Winter Fairies join us.

214
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:02,336
I'll say it is.

215
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:05,488
It's enough to give you the vapors.

216
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:10,469
Tinker Bell, don't you Tinkers
ever stop tinkering?

217
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:15,599
Can't seem to get
this latch to open!

218
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:17,625
It had better not stick like that

219
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,210
for our grand finale.

220
00:15:19,211 --> 00:15:22,231
- Is it starting?
- No, that's just Clank.

221
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:28,737
The thing is pretty
loud, eh, Bobble?

222
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,805
Indeed, my bugling buddy.

223
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,075
Sure makes me thirsty, though.

224
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:37,955
It's starting!

225
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,488
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
Bobble...

226
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:49,717
Oh, no! Already?

227
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,159
Hold these!

228
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,785
But the show just started!

229
00:15:52,786 --> 00:15:54,596
Ask them to wait!

230
00:16:00,377 --> 00:16:02,896
Hey, guys, I can't see!

231
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:06,049
Oh! It's Periwinkle!

232
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,800
- Beautiful.
- Oh, look at that.

233
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:08,986
Hi, Peri!

234
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:12,322
That's my sister.

235
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,374
All right!

236
00:16:31,367 --> 00:16:32,968
Oh, wow!

237
00:16:36,413 --> 00:16:38,331
- Yeah!
- Yay!

238
00:16:38,332 --> 00:16:40,225
Go, fairies!

239
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,562
R0, did you do those?
That wasn't in rehearsal.

240
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:45,606
Wasn't me.

241
00:16:45,881 --> 00:16:49,193
I never work with poppies.
The pollen makes me sleepy.

242
00:16:50,469 --> 00:16:51,820
Wait. Is that...

243
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,722
Zarina?

244
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:55,866
- Zarina?
- Hmm.

245
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:56,974
She's back?

246
00:16:56,975 --> 00:16:59,161
What's with that wild hair?

247
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,024
Oh, look at those flowers!

248
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,376
Ooh!

249
00:17:06,402 --> 00:17:09,404
Spring must be next!
That's my favorite.

250
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:11,322
Oh, I hope Clanky doesn't miss it.

251
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,549
Oh!

252
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:23,894
- Wow! Oh!
- Huh?

253
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,485
Oh, lovely! Oh!

254
00:17:31,719 --> 00:17:34,780
- Guys, guys! We gotta hide!
- Oh!

255
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:36,198
Now, now, now!

256
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:41,853
They've really outdone
themselves this year.

257
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,958
What a show.

258
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,734
Whoo!

259
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,700
Excuse me. Sorry.
Yes, me again. Coming through.

260
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:21,934
No, no, don't get up.

261
00:18:21,935 --> 00:18:23,675
Oh, sorry, I should have flown.

262
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:26,957
- Thank you, Bobble.
- What did I miss?

263
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:45,851
Wake up!

264
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:47,102
Wake up!

265
00:18:47,169 --> 00:18:49,670
Please! Anyone?

266
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:52,357
Clank, help us! Down here!

267
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:53,901
Clank!

268
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:56,385
- In here! In the box!
- Oh! Oh, oh...

269
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,572
- Ms. Bell?
- Help, we're stuck.

270
00:18:58,639 --> 00:19:00,949
Right. How does it open?

271
00:19:01,016 --> 00:19:03,285
Push the button!

272
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,978
Thank you so much.

273
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,206
You've got to see this.

274
00:19:13,403 --> 00:19:14,796
Oh, no.

275
00:19:17,658 --> 00:19:19,909
- Are they...
- No. Goodness, no.

276
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:23,579
They're in a deep sleep.

277
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,349
For how long?

278
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:27,768
At least a couple of days.

279
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,437
Why would Zarina do this?

280
00:19:30,504 --> 00:19:32,564
Clank, did you see her?

281
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:34,608
No, no.

282
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,904
Yes, yes, I saw her
flying towards the dust depot.

283
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:43,659
The blue pixie dust.

284
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:45,268
Ooh, this is bad.

285
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:46,435
Uh, yeah.

286
00:19:46,436 --> 00:19:49,647
Without it, the tree
can't make pixie dust.

287
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,376
And if the tree
can't make pixie dust...

288
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,794
We can't fly.

289
00:19:53,861 --> 00:19:55,653
On! Can't... Can't fly...

290
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:57,113
- Deep breaths.
- Can't fly...

291
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,782
- Okay. Okay.
- That's it. Deep breaths.

292
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,785
What could she want it for?

293
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:05,389
I don't know. But we
have to find her.

294
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,332
Clank, stay here
and watch over everyone.

295
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,584
I'm on it.

296
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,252
Especially the Winter Fairies.

297
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,271
Make sure they get
a steady stream of snow.

298
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,815
Right!

299
00:20:16,258 --> 00:20:17,609
Right.

300
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,865
The blue dust has a strong glow.
If we can just spot it...

301
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:31,206
There!

302
00:20:35,861 --> 00:20:37,462
Whoa, she's moving fast!

303
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,216
Oh, sorry!

304
00:20:43,493 --> 00:20:45,661
Where is all this fog coming from?

305
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:47,973
It's mist. We must be
getting near the coast.

306
00:20:48,874 --> 00:20:51,018
We're losing her!

307
00:20:51,752 --> 00:20:53,353
Over there!

308
00:20:57,174 --> 00:20:58,442
Oh, my!

309
00:20:58,508 --> 00:20:59,943
Oh, no.

310
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,703
It's...

311
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,937
Pirates.

312
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:13,081
Great, now there's pirates.

313
00:21:13,148 --> 00:21:15,125
Maybe they're nice pirates.

314
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:16,734
Right.

315
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:19,987
They must have captured her,
forced her to take the dust.

316
00:21:19,988 --> 00:21:21,614
Well, we have to rescue her.

317
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,324
But they're...

318
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:26,577
Deep breaths. Deep
breaths.

319
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,745
- Okay.
- Hmm.

320
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:32,875
- Magnificent!
- Quite right.

321
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,644
A fine haul.

322
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,439
We got their blue dust!

323
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:39,632
Well, it's not theirs anymore.

324
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:42,134
It is theirs no longer.

325
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:45,054
I just said that,
you daft potato muncher.

326
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,555
Potato...

327
00:21:46,556 --> 00:21:47,974
They're holding her
in the bottom of the boat.

328
00:21:47,975 --> 00:21:50,017
You've got a right
wee brain, you know that?

329
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,394
Still smart enough

330
00:21:51,395 --> 00:21:54,122
to know we got their dust!

331
00:21:54,189 --> 00:21:58,734
Let me just say that your plan
worked perfectly, Captain.

332
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,505
"Captain"?

333
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,239
Here's to perfect plans.

334
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:05,300
Ave! Perfect!

335
00:22:05,367 --> 00:22:07,410
Guess she doesn't need rescuing.

336
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,346
But now the hair makes sense.

337
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,889
What do we do now?

338
00:22:10,956 --> 00:22:13,600
Let's just get the dust
and get out of here.

339
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:16,335
A little bit of pillage,
a little bit of plunder.

340
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,479
Oh!

341
00:22:21,842 --> 00:22:23,527
Fairies!

342
00:22:24,177 --> 00:22:25,946
Ahh!

343
00:22:27,097 --> 00:22:29,491
Get her! Get her!

344
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,118
Whoa!

345
00:22:33,145 --> 00:22:34,287
Got it.

346
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,605
- Here!
- She's getting away!

347
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,458
They took the blue dust!

348
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,086
Captain!

349
00:22:44,406 --> 00:22:45,865
Give me back that dust!

350
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:47,884
Zarina, why are you doing this?

351
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:49,761
Fawn!

352
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:54,999
If you give it to me,
I'll give you quarter.

353
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,602
Quarter? I think we need all of it.

354
00:22:57,669 --> 00:22:58,961
"Quarter" means mercy!

355
00:22:58,962 --> 00:23:00,296
Ooh.

356
00:23:00,297 --> 00:23:02,774
This dust belongs to Pixie Hollow.

357
00:23:02,966 --> 00:23:04,943
You had your chance.

358
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,211
Wake up.

359
00:23:23,403 --> 00:23:25,130
Tink, wake up.

360
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,034
What happened?

361
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:33,930
The last thing I remember was
Zarina throwing that dust at us.

362
00:23:36,124 --> 00:23:37,666
Your dress.

363
00:23:37,667 --> 00:23:39,060
I know. Um...

364
00:23:43,006 --> 00:23:44,590
ls everyone all right?

365
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,026
I guess so.

366
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:49,029
I'm not. Look at my outfit!

367
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,971
Orange is not my color.

368
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,139
She's right.

369
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:55,101
Listen, we have to get out of here
and go after Zarina.

370
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,745
Silvermist, can you part the...

371
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,689
Shut it Off! Shut it Off!

372
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,417
I didn't do anything. I just...

373
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:04,044
Tink!

374
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:07,238
Tink, could you stop
not doing anything?

375
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,989
It's okay, I got this.

376
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,074
Whoa!

377
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,867
Silvermist, are you okay?

378
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:12,952
Whoa!

379
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:16,705
That's weird.
Here, let me help you.

380
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:18,916
It's so bright!

381
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:20,644
- Bright!
- Fawn, I can't see!

382
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:24,189
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

383
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:25,714
Ew, ew, ew, ew.

384
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:27,455
Get them off. Get them off!
Get them off!

385
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:28,634
Get them off!

386
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:30,010
Wait a minute.

387
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:31,863
Do you realize what this means?

388
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:35,951
Oh, my gosh!
Zarina switched our heads!

389
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:37,977
No. No, no, no.

390
00:24:37,978 --> 00:24:39,854
She switched our talents.

391
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:41,564
- Excuse me?
- What?

392
00:24:41,565 --> 00:24:43,667
I must be a Water Fairy now.

393
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,627
Oh, so, that's why
your dress is blue.

394
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,112
And I guess you're a
Fast-Flying Fairy.

395
00:24:48,113 --> 00:24:50,548
I'm a... I'm a Light Fairy.

396
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,408
Ow.

397
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:54,636
- Garden Fairy!
- Oh.

398
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:58,664
Looks like I'm an
Animal Fairy now. Huh.

399
00:24:58,665 --> 00:25:00,016
Lucky me.

400
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:03,061
No, no, no, it can't be.

401
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:06,255
- You're a...
- Don't say it.

402
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,526
Tinker Bell, take these things
back right now!

403
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:11,010
Okay.

404
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:13,571
Tinker.

405
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,574
Guys, come on,
we gotta get out of here.

406
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:20,662
Well, you're the Water Fairy.
Part the waters.

407
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:25,375
Um, use both hands this time.

408
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,504
Well, you don't see that every day.

409
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,675
You guys better hurry!
I can't hold it!

410
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:47,338
Oops!

411
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:51,342
Guys, are you...

412
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:56,656
.“okay?

413
00:25:56,723 --> 00:25:58,116
Yeah.

414
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,785
Guys, I think I broke something.

415
00:26:04,147 --> 00:26:05,248
Whoa!

416
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:06,398
Uh...

417
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,859
Nice, little, harmless,

418
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,504
sharp-toothed, hungry croco...

419
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:15,759
dile.

420
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:17,260
Fawn!

421
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,495
It's okay. When babies are born,

422
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:21,973
they imprint on the
first thing they see.

423
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:26,794
Uh, guys, sorry to interrupt
whatever that is,

424
00:26:26,795 --> 00:26:28,837
but the pirate ship is gone.

425
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,440
- What?
- Oh, no.

426
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:32,633
Sil, Fast Flyer, check it out.

427
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,110
Oh, yeah.

428
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:43,703
Where is she?

429
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:49,042
You guys, I saw it, up the coast!
Let's go!

430
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:55,006
Oh, right, you can't fly.

431
00:26:55,073 --> 00:26:56,716
Wet wings.

432
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:59,594
Still, there's got to
be a way to... Ah!

433
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,014
Excuse me, Ro.

434
00:27:03,331 --> 00:27:05,642
Hmm. Structurally sound enough.

435
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:07,852
Strength-to-weight
ratio seems good.

436
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,087
If I had some rope...

437
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,648
Oh!

438
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,651
You're thinking like a Tinker.

439
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,487
Okay, fine.

440
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,489
Get me some vines.

441
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,890
Not a problem.

442
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,912
Will these do?

443
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,708
Okay, ready?

444
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:32,502
Wait for me!

445
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,113
Sorry. Gotta...

446
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,174
Can I please have that?

447
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:40,593
- Oh!
Go!

448
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:53,857
There's the pirate ship!

449
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:58,135
You can slow down now!

450
00:27:58,136 --> 00:28:00,697
Easy for you to say.

451
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:03,741
Hold on!

452
00:28:08,438 --> 00:28:10,665
Well, at least our wings are dry.

453
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,066
Yeah.

454
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,942
Twenty-one
gun salute to the captain!

455
00:28:13,943 --> 00:28:15,879
Right, 21.

456
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:21,176
- Nice boom!
- Oh, yes! Nice!

457
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,886
Ohh!

458
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:26,806
Music to my ear!

459
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:28,349
That's right!

460
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:29,601
Encore!

461
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:31,126
Beautiful!

462
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,770
Yes, yes, yes!

463
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:35,273
Cease fire!

464
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:38,151
What? Cease fire?
What for?

465
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:39,819
That was only seven.

466
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,865
I say 21.

467
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:47,643
Right!

468
00:28:47,644 --> 00:28:52,165
Twenty-one, obviously, on the
metric system, which is fine.

469
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,084
Come on,
we've got to find that dust.

470
00:28:55,151 --> 00:28:58,529
If I may, good sirs, I believe

471
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,216
the proper acknowledgment
would be a toast.

472
00:29:01,741 --> 00:29:04,385
A toast it is!

473
00:29:04,411 --> 00:29:06,787
Now, there is a good cabin boy.

474
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,455
A beautiful suggestion.

475
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,749
- Quite thirsty, myself.
- Uh-uh!

476
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,353
If it pleases the captain.

477
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:21,135
You tell those scurvy
scallywags that...

478
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:23,780
What did she say?

479
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,115
She said, it does!

480
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:30,811
What is better
than a good mug of grog?

481
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:32,497
Two mugs!

482
00:29:33,565 --> 00:29:36,960
Your tea, Captain. Earl Grey, hot.

483
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:39,379
Please, sir, may I have some more?

484
00:29:40,155 --> 00:29:42,173
To our cunning captain.

485
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,717
Okay, you gotta love the boots.

486
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,970
Just one year ago,
we'd lost everything.

487
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:50,223
Our ship turned adrift, and then

488
00:29:50,415 --> 00:29:53,333
we found her.

489
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:58,147
Exactly. We needed a captain.

490
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:01,467
And when we humbly asked
if she could make us fly...

491
00:30:01,468 --> 00:30:03,427
She didn't stop there.

492
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,655
No! She did one better, she did.

493
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:07,139
Better indeed!

494
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,684
Soon, she's going to
make the whole ship fly!

495
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:11,894
To flying!

496
00:30:13,229 --> 00:30:14,706
Fly?

497
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,107
<i>First the Tower of London, arr!</i>

498
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,793
<i>The guards won't know what hit it</i>

499
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,153
<i>We'll swoop right down
and take the crown</i>

500
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,131
<i>And the Crown Jewels with it</i>

501
00:30:23,198 --> 00:30:24,907
<i>And when we fly to Paris</i>

502
00:30:24,908 --> 00:30:27,135
<i>Oh, the treasures I'll be grabbin'</i>

503
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:29,411
<i>The Mona Lisa will look lovely</i>

504
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:31,347
<i>Hanging in me cabin</i>

505
00:30:31,414 --> 00:30:32,623
Hey-ho

506
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:34,350
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go</i>

507
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,477
<i>No one can stop us When we're so</i>

508
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,439
<i>High in the stratosphere!</i>

509
00:30:39,506 --> 00:30:40,898
Hey-ho

510
00:30:40,965 --> 00:30:42,424
<i>We'll be the freighter
that plunders</i>

511
00:30:42,425 --> 00:30:44,444
<i>Every one of the world's
seven wonders</i>

512
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:45,677
<i>When we're up in the skies</i>

513
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:47,780
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

514
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:51,659
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

515
00:30:51,726 --> 00:30:53,852
<i>Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads</i>

516
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:55,705
<i>And here's what I'll be stealin'</i>

517
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,731
<i>I'll rob the Sistine Chapel</i>

518
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:59,834
<i>Of the Sistine Chapel's cieilin'</i>

519
00:30:59,901 --> 00:31:01,902
<i>And for all the folks in Egypt</i>

520
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,796
<i>It will be a dismal day</i>

521
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:06,031
<i>They'll be crying for their mummies</i>

522
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,176
<i>When we take their mummies away!</i>

523
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:09,368
Hey-ho

524
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:11,304
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go</i>

525
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,931
<i>No can stop us when we're so high!</i>

526
00:31:13,998 --> 00:31:16,392
<i>They will all cower in fear</i>

527
00:31:16,459 --> 00:31:19,419
<i>Hey-ho, from Delhi to Rio to Venice</i>

528
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,081
<i>There's no city that
we will not menace</i>

529
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:22,798
<i>When we're up in the skies</i>

530
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,841
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

531
00:31:24,842 --> 00:31:28,845
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

532
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,325
<i>- Oh, how high we will be!
- We will be</i>

533
00:31:32,392 --> 00:31:36,144
<i>'Cause the blue fairy dust
Surely packs a mighty wallop</i>

534
00:31:36,145 --> 00:31:37,563
<i>Only takes a dollop</i>

535
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,500
<i>- Soon it will set us free
- We'll be free</i>

536
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:42,752
<i>From the chains of gravity</i>

537
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,028
<i>Then we'll hoist up the sail</i>

538
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,298
<i>And we'll set course for the sun</i>

539
00:31:47,365 --> 00:31:48,949
<i>'Cause when you've got wings</i>

540
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,243
<i>No wicked deed cannot be done</i>

541
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:53,036
<i>And we owe it all</i>

542
00:31:53,037 --> 00:31:56,891
<i>To our great and glorious captain</i>

543
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,376
Although, now that you mention it,

544
00:31:59,377 --> 00:32:02,814
why are we taking orders
from some fairy, anyway?

545
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,442
Heh, heh, heh...

546
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:08,319
Two, three, four!

547
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,239
<i>Hey-ho, imagine the
places that we'll go</i>

548
00:32:11,306 --> 00:32:13,765
<i>No one can stop us
when we're so high</i>

549
00:32:13,766 --> 00:32:16,577
<i>- Givin' a pirate cheer
Arr!</i>

550
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:19,396
<i>Hey-ho, we'll be
the freighter that plunders</i>

551
00:32:19,397 --> 00:32:21,398
<i>Every one of the world's
seven wonders</i>

552
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,774
<i>When we're up in the skies</i>

553
00:32:22,775 --> 00:32:24,836
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

554
00:32:24,902 --> 00:32:27,463
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a town or a county</i>

555
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:30,425
<i>That will not yield its bounty up</i>

556
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:32,927
<i>When our ship draws near</i>

557
00:32:32,994 --> 00:32:36,038
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a city or village</i>

558
00:32:36,039 --> 00:32:37,789
<i>That we will not plunder or pillage</i>

559
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,249
<i>When we're up in the skies</i>

560
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,935
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

561
00:32:41,002 --> 00:32:45,398
<i>And every nation
will give a donation</i>

562
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:48,675
<i>When they see us sail the skies</i>

563
00:32:48,676 --> 00:32:50,778
<i>In a frigate that flies!</i>

564
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:51,970
<i>Hey!</i>

565
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:55,575
Ah!

566
00:33:16,788 --> 00:33:18,246
- Whoa.
- Tink.

567
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:23,102
It looks like...

568
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:25,462
The Pixie Dust Tree back home.

569
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,273
Zarina must have grown it.

570
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:29,525
So, that's how they're
going to fly.

571
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:32,195
She's going to make pixie dust.

572
00:33:34,931 --> 00:33:37,533
Ahoy, you biscuit-eating
bilge rats!

573
00:33:38,518 --> 00:33:40,536
Prepare to dock starboard!

574
00:33:40,603 --> 00:33:42,312
Docking starboard!

575
00:33:42,313 --> 00:33:45,023
Captain says, raise the sails
and step lively!

576
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:46,650
Raise the sails!

577
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:48,151
Heave!

578
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:50,755
Bring her around, Mr. Yang!

579
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,883
Bringing her around!

580
00:33:58,079 --> 00:33:59,705
- Let go anchor!
- Let go anchor!

581
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:01,665
- Get out all lines!
- Get out all lines!

582
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,166
Casting lines!

583
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:06,854
- Come on, get moving.
- Are you talking to me?

584
00:34:06,921 --> 00:34:09,047
Captain says, restock the ship.

585
00:34:09,048 --> 00:34:10,298
We set sail at dawn.

586
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,944
Yes, Captain.
Load ship, right away.

587
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,011
Hey, watch where
you're swinging that thing!

588
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:16,989
Work faster, now!

589
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:19,391
That's it!

590
00:34:19,392 --> 00:34:20,660
Come on.

591
00:34:25,356 --> 00:34:26,666
Locked.

592
00:34:26,691 --> 00:34:27,816
Come on, you lubber,
get on with it.

593
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:28,984
Someone's coming!

594
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,110
Pirate!

595
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:31,462
Hide!

596
00:34:38,369 --> 00:34:40,412
Animal Fairy, you're up.

597
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:44,141
Excuse me, mouse. Uh...

598
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,709
Mr. Mouse.

599
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:48,187
Would you mind terribly moving on?

600
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,422
We need this space to
do a little hiding.

601
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:52,191
Oh!

602
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:54,610
Much obliged.

603
00:34:55,178 --> 00:34:56,678
Bye-bye!

604
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:58,823
Aw, what a cute little mouse.

605
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,867
It was a rat.

606
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,142
Ew!

607
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:03,494
Hey, shoo, rat!

608
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:10,668
Uh, permission to enter, Captain.

609
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:12,295
This is our chance.

610
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:14,463
Now!

611
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,258
No!

612
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:20,177
I had Oppenheimer
make you your favorite.

613
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,139
The dust.

614
00:35:23,956 --> 00:35:26,541
I know how much you like a little
something sweet while you work.

615
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,896
Well, you're quite welcome.

616
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:31,880
Hmm? Oh, uh...

617
00:35:31,881 --> 00:35:34,191
Uh, yes, of course. Sorry.

618
00:35:34,425 --> 00:35:36,569
Ah, right, second drawer.

619
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,659
Look at that.

620
00:35:43,726 --> 00:35:46,871
It sparkles like a
thousand sapphires.

621
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:51,167
You're quite the little genius.

622
00:35:51,943 --> 00:35:56,172
It's hard to believe the other fairies
didn't appreciate your talent.

623
00:35:57,406 --> 00:35:59,717
- Sil?
- She looks seasick.

624
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:04,347
This never happened
when I was a Water Fairy.

625
00:36:04,372 --> 00:36:06,206
You know,
I remember when I couldn't

626
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:08,083
- understand a single jingle.
- Oh, no!

627
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,310
Huh?

628
00:36:15,967 --> 00:36:17,443
I'm fine.

629
00:36:23,558 --> 00:36:24,867
Fawn!

630
00:36:27,687 --> 00:36:30,230
- Sorry!
- What are you doing?

631
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:33,066
- What Dess does.
- That's not what I do.

632
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,359
Well, stop it!

633
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,088
You shouldn't take
light so lightly.

634
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,426
- What?
- What, what? What?

635
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:44,637
No, nothing, nothing!

636
00:36:44,829 --> 00:36:46,097
Ooh.

637
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,065
It's still so hard to believe that
this blue dust can make flying dust.

638
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:58,943
Yes, but only if you...

639
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:00,802
Ah!

640
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:05,866
So, the secret is the infusion of the
blue dust directly into the tree.

641
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,851
You okay?

642
00:37:07,852 --> 00:37:09,829
Start throwing out the line.

643
00:37:09,896 --> 00:37:12,397
All right, Tink, open the drawer
as much as you can.

644
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:14,538
So, once the golden
dust has been produced...

645
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:16,318
Sil, hold the line.

646
00:37:16,319 --> 00:37:18,445
The sluice will coat the
ship with the perfect amount,

647
00:37:18,446 --> 00:37:21,799
and at that point,
we take to the skies!

648
00:37:23,659 --> 00:37:25,928
Very impressive, Captain.

649
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:29,557
No pirate I know could
have imagined such a scheme.

650
00:37:29,624 --> 00:37:30,933
Whoa!

651
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:32,268
Ahh!

652
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:34,210
- Oh.
- Vidia!

653
00:37:34,211 --> 00:37:37,523
You've turned out to be quite
the pint-sized prodigy,

654
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,774
if I may say.

655
00:37:40,051 --> 00:37:42,820
It's been an adventure
and an honor.

656
00:37:42,887 --> 00:37:45,364
Your sword, Captain.

657
00:37:47,934 --> 00:37:49,035
Hmm.

658
00:37:56,859 --> 00:37:58,193
Y'all okay?

659
00:37:58,194 --> 00:37:59,569
Yeah. They're headed for the tree.

660
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,755
Come on!

661
00:38:00,821 --> 00:38:02,447
Whoa! What is up with your...

662
00:38:02,448 --> 00:38:05,200
Hey, hey, we should
catch up with Tink.

663
00:38:05,201 --> 00:38:06,385
Shh.

664
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,472
All right, just give me the strap.

665
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:12,040
That's it, hold it in place.

666
00:38:12,041 --> 00:38:14,810
Right, watch the
angle of the flume.

667
00:38:14,877 --> 00:38:17,104
Too much pitch,
and she'll overflow.

668
00:38:17,296 --> 00:38:18,421
Aye aye, Captain!

669
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:20,465
Make sure the seams are sealed.

670
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,550
Captain doesn't want
to lose a single grain

671
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,344
of that precious dust.

672
00:38:24,345 --> 00:38:26,030
Oh, that golden dust.

673
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,103
Dess! Quiet!

674
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,873
Sorry. I barely touched it.

675
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:37,691
Well, don't touch it at all.

676
00:38:37,692 --> 00:38:40,360
- Just hover.
- Yeah, hover.

677
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,629
All right, all right.

678
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:49,011
As soon as she's gone, we'll grab
the dust and get out of here.

679
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:51,329
Maybe we should try
and talk to her.

680
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:54,975
Yeah, because that worked out
so well back at the waterfall.

681
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,357
Hey, shoo.

682
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,383
Hey!

683
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:04,860
Shoo, shoo!

684
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,987
Hey, hey, hey...

685
00:39:07,304 --> 00:39:09,031
Go, go, go!

686
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,742
Oh, no. No!
No, no, no, no, no!

687
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,120
Stop growing. Stop growing.
Please, branch, no!

688
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:20,984
We 9011 you!

689
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:23,445
Did you really think
by switching our talents,

690
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:24,779
you could beat us?

691
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,948
Looks that way.

692
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:28,408
Got them!

693
00:39:28,409 --> 00:39:29,635
Zarina!

694
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:34,140
Well done. Got them all
in one swell foop, I did.

695
00:39:37,835 --> 00:39:40,170
Zarina, don't do this.

696
00:39:40,171 --> 00:39:42,982
Come back with us. Come back home.

697
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:50,447
I'll never go back to Pixie Hollow.

698
00:39:50,598 --> 00:39:52,307
You don't belong here.

699
00:39:52,308 --> 00:39:55,035
This is exactly where
I belong, Tink.

700
00:39:55,394 --> 00:39:57,955
We appreciate what she can do.

701
00:39:58,022 --> 00:40:00,040
We treasure it, actually.

702
00:40:03,277 --> 00:40:06,505
Put them below,
and keep your eye on them.

703
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,508
Oh, right.
Maybe I'll use, uh, this one?

704
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,635
While you still have it.

705
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:15,806
Captain, are you all right?

706
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,770
Captain says, back
to work, gentlemen.

707
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:24,273
All righty, mates, you heard him.

708
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:28,527
And, right.

709
00:40:29,428 --> 00:40:30,678
Perfect fit.

710
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:33,181
Welcome to your new cabin.

711
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:34,849
Oh.

712
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,643
Me stock is ready.

713
00:40:41,315 --> 00:40:44,859
- Oh, well, now, look at that.
- Oh, lovely.

714
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:46,694
Oh, that is good
eating right there.

715
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:49,089
Isn't it, Mum?
"Yes, it is, darling."

716
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:53,844
Oh, let me see.
What shall I make tonight?

717
00:40:53,911 --> 00:40:57,705
Well, I've still got some lard
and some old cabbage.

718
00:40:57,706 --> 00:41:00,434
Okay, we need a plan.

719
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,275
Here we go.

720
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,751
- Whoa!
- Mmm.

721
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,382
- Ah!
- Oh!

722
00:41:31,657 --> 00:41:33,008
It worked!

723
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:35,761
- Yes, she did it!
- It worked!

724
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,222
- it's working!
- Pixie dust!

725
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,892
Look at it! Amazing!

726
00:41:42,501 --> 00:41:44,770
We're going to fly!

727
00:41:44,795 --> 00:41:48,089
From a trickle to a roar.

728
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,276
Fly like a happy bird!

729
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:53,487
Cold gruel, with a
little bit of sawdust.

730
00:41:53,554 --> 00:41:56,490
A dash of rodent,
sauteed of course.

731
00:41:56,515 --> 00:41:58,701
Some carrots? No.

732
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:01,269
Hey, where you think
you're going, little fella?

733
00:42:02,855 --> 00:42:04,415
Now is our chance. Go, go, go, go!

734
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,608
Come on, all together.

735
00:42:06,609 --> 00:42:08,252
I'm going as fast as I can!

736
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:11,880
Oh, not today, my darlings.

737
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:15,801
Would you be kind enough
to hold this for me?

738
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,720
Perfect.

739
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,931
Anybody else got an idea?

740
00:42:24,627 --> 00:42:26,878
Absolutely astonishing.

741
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,840
Just imagine, flying like a bird.

742
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:35,112
Of course,
you do that all the time.

743
00:42:36,055 --> 00:42:38,824
What's it like?
How do you even steer?

744
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:41,285
It's pretty simple, actually.
Lean left.

745
00:42:42,269 --> 00:42:44,455
Lean right, fly right.

746
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,757
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

747
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:59,053
This is...

748
00:42:59,245 --> 00:43:01,013
Are you afraid?

749
00:43:01,163 --> 00:43:02,598
Hmm?

750
00:43:02,665 --> 00:43:04,224
Afraid?

751
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,101
Lead on, Captain.

752
00:43:16,345 --> 00:43:18,846
Oh, I'm doing it.

753
00:43:18,847 --> 00:43:20,199
I'm...

754
00:43:20,683 --> 00:43:22,368
I'm flying!

755
00:43:23,811 --> 00:43:25,454
Look out, mates!

756
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:28,835
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Look at him go.

757
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:31,835
What's so funny? Whoa!
Whoa, whoa...

758
00:43:32,194 --> 00:43:35,464
You can't fly like that.
Put your legs together.

759
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:48,435
Whoo!

760
00:43:48,919 --> 00:43:50,687
Oh!

761
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,608
On.

762
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:07,996
Just try to keep up.

763
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,461
Whoo-hoo!

764
00:44:15,529 --> 00:44:17,506
Whoo.

765
00:44:17,614 --> 00:44:18,990
Ave ave, Captain!

766
00:44:18,991 --> 00:44:20,783
The lad is flying!

767
00:44:23,871 --> 00:44:26,890
It works! It really works.

768
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:30,335
And pretty soon, we'll have enough
dust to make the whole ship fly.

769
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:32,104
Right, Zarina?

770
00:44:32,755 --> 00:44:37,008
And as long as we have the blue dust,
we'll never run out of flying dust.

771
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,403
- Right again?
- Right again, James.

772
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,492
Well, then, we won't
need you anymore.

773
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:51,165
Our plan worked perfectly.

774
00:44:52,024 --> 00:44:54,650
Fairies are such
gullible creatures.

775
00:44:54,651 --> 00:44:56,253
Aren't they, lads?

776
00:44:57,112 --> 00:45:00,239
No match for an Eton education
such as mine.

777
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,532
He's a smart one, isn't he?

778
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:04,619
The power of the pixie dust
is finally ours.

779
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:10,708
We've had enough kissing up
to that pint-sized prima donna.

780
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,126
No quarter for her.

781
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:14,045
Let's make her walk a
tiny little plank.

782
00:45:14,046 --> 00:45:15,713
- Yes, tiny!
- A tiny plank!

783
00:45:15,714 --> 00:45:18,317
She can fly, you cretins.

784
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,801
- Oh!
- You know, he's right.

785
00:45:19,802 --> 00:45:21,427
That is why he is the captain.

786
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:22,637
She'd just fly away. I get it.

787
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:24,490
<i>Mi capitan.</i>

788
00:45:24,515 --> 00:45:26,766
What if we tie her wings together?

789
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,352
There's no stopping us.

790
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:32,605
We'll plunder every port
in all the seven seas.

791
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:38,236
Prepare to get under way,
you scurvy scallywags.

792
00:45:38,237 --> 00:45:40,321
We've got a ship to fly.

793
00:45:43,075 --> 00:45:48,764
Ha. And as for you, you'll
make a fine little nightlight.

794
00:46:07,057 --> 00:46:08,951
Swoggle me eyes.

795
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,287
Now, there's a sight.

796
00:46:13,981 --> 00:46:16,482
Oh, don't feel foolish.

797
00:46:16,483 --> 00:46:18,961
I was just too clever for you.
That's all.

798
00:46:22,823 --> 00:46:25,700
Ah! Yes.

799
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:27,869
Now, you see, my little fairy,

800
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:30,764
navigating the Never
Seas is one thing.

801
00:46:30,998 --> 00:46:33,517
But to chart a course for the sky,

802
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:36,728
not only do you need
longitude and latitude,

803
00:46:36,795 --> 00:46:39,714
but you also need altitude.

804
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:41,483
Hmm. Oh...

805
00:46:41,717 --> 00:46:44,152
Now, let's not be a sore loser.

806
00:46:46,221 --> 00:46:50,325
Once we're past the second star,
the world will be my oyster.

807
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:52,226
And I don't even like oysters.

808
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:57,273
We'll be in and out of every port so fast,
they won't even know what hit them.

809
00:46:58,442 --> 00:47:00,026
No, no, no.

810
00:47:00,027 --> 00:47:02,504
Nice try, but it's fairy-proof.

811
00:47:02,571 --> 00:47:03,922
Brilliant, right?

812
00:47:07,951 --> 00:47:10,012
Oppenheimer!

813
00:47:10,746 --> 00:47:13,289
That ticking is driving me mad!

814
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,892
Right. It's just a clock, you know.

815
00:47:16,293 --> 00:47:17,835
Well, not to worry.

816
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:19,879
Pretty soon,
we'll be flying so high

817
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,400
it'll make these high seas
look downright low!

818
00:47:23,842 --> 00:47:25,343
- Crazy.
- Like we have a choice.

819
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:27,428
Come on, guys,
we're gonna get out of this.

820
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:29,013
Well, we wouldn't even be in it

821
00:47:29,014 --> 00:47:31,766
if our new Garden Fairy didn't
grow branches willy-nilly!

822
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,267
You're not saying this is my fault.

823
00:47:33,393 --> 00:47:34,893
Hmm. If the flower fits.

824
00:47:34,895 --> 00:47:39,941
How can I cook with all that
infernal jingle-jangling?

825
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:42,109
There's only one thing to do.

826
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:47,883
Oh, much better.
Don't you think, Mum?

827
00:47:48,075 --> 00:47:49,242
None of it would've happened

828
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:50,785
if you would have come over
to help me with the bee!

829
00:47:50,786 --> 00:47:52,828
Are you saying this is my fault?

830
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,455
Well, if the rose fits.

831
00:47:54,456 --> 00:47:57,083
Let's not point fingers.
It's Zarina's fault.

832
00:47:57,084 --> 00:47:58,918
- Guys? Guys?
- Right, what about her?

833
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:00,670
Yeah, let's talk about that.

834
00:48:00,671 --> 00:48:01,813
Guys, look!

835
00:48:03,090 --> 00:48:05,734
Great. Just what I need.

836
00:48:07,511 --> 00:48:11,448
Uh-uh-uh. Bad crocodile. Bad croc.

837
00:48:11,765 --> 00:48:13,766
I am not your mother!

838
00:48:13,767 --> 00:48:16,310
Wait. Rosetta,
he can get us out of here.

839
00:48:16,311 --> 00:48:17,746
You're right.

840
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:21,291
Good. Good crocodile. Come here.

841
00:48:21,316 --> 00:48:22,984
<i>Come here, stocky.</i>

842
00:48:22,985 --> 00:48:24,586
Come to Mama.

843
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,546
Shh! Quiet.

844
00:48:27,197 --> 00:48:29,949
Okay. Now, pull us off the table.

845
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,577
Come here. Come to Mama.

846
00:48:32,578 --> 00:48:34,388
That's right, sugar.

847
00:48:35,956 --> 00:48:37,891
What is going on here?

848
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:39,333
A stowaway, is it?

849
00:48:39,334 --> 00:48:40,602
Oh, no!

850
00:48:40,669 --> 00:48:42,396
Oh, no, you don't.

851
00:48:42,462 --> 00:48:43,772
Hello.

852
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:45,607
Hurry! Hurry!

853
00:48:45,716 --> 00:48:47,442
- Gotcha!
- Rosetta!

854
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:49,361
A little extra flavor.

855
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:55,283
Ooh!

856
00:48:55,309 --> 00:48:57,077
Good job, crocky.

857
00:48:57,144 --> 00:48:59,854
You are such a good little boy.
Yes, you are.

858
00:48:59,855 --> 00:49:01,188
What a good little
widdle snuggle wuggums.

859
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,356
That's his mama.

860
00:49:02,357 --> 00:49:04,609
Okay, enough.
Let's get out of here.

861
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,069
Wait, Vidia.
We can't just race out there.

862
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:08,255
They'll see us.

863
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,216
Hmm.

864
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:14,368
Make ready to sail!

865
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,595
Aye aye, Captain!

866
00:49:15,954 --> 00:49:18,039
I love the life of a pirate.

867
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,083
But I hate rats.

868
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,418
Move it, Port.

869
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:24,128
I'll move it in me own good time.

870
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:25,814
Huh, see anything?

871
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:28,358
Nope. All clear up here.

872
00:49:28,842 --> 00:49:32,011
Well, it's not clear down here.
It stinks!

873
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:33,780
I know, isn't it great?

874
00:49:33,847 --> 00:49:35,991
- Smells just like skunk.
- Huh.

875
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:37,725
Spoken like a true Animal Fairy.

876
00:49:37,726 --> 00:49:38,910
I Wish.

877
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:42,313
All right, you guys. Remember,
right arm, left foot. Got it?

878
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:43,439
Aye aye.

879
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,940
Sil, I'm right, you're left.

880
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,108
- Right.
- No, left.

881
00:49:46,109 --> 00:49:47,234
- I mean, left.
- What?

882
00:49:47,235 --> 00:49:49,070
- And you're right.
- Let's go.

883
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:50,172
AYE aye!

884
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:54,176
Big pole.

885
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:55,409
Back, back, back.

886
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:56,702
Forward, forward, forward.

887
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,306
Hey, you swabs, work faster!

888
00:50:00,290 --> 00:50:01,433
Hey!

889
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:03,435
Oppenheimer!

890
00:50:04,086 --> 00:50:06,021
Don't forget the kippers.

891
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:09,316
And you, back to work.

892
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:10,650
<i>Ah, muy bien.</i>

893
00:50:10,926 --> 00:50:13,695
Ah, we're gonna fly, mate!
We're gonna fly!

894
00:50:13,762 --> 00:50:15,179
It's a do-si-do.

895
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:16,448
I can't dance!

896
00:50:20,310 --> 00:50:21,519
Uh-Oh.

897
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,871
Look out!

898
00:50:23,355 --> 00:50:24,522
Fly!

899
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:25,648
Would you watch where I'm going?

900
00:50:25,649 --> 00:50:26,750
Go, go!

901
00:50:28,276 --> 00:50:29,795
Come on!

902
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,655
- Hurry UP!
- Okay.

903
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:34,090
We got it!

904
00:50:37,244 --> 00:50:39,137
Return that blue dust!

905
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:45,060
Or your friend is done for.

906
00:50:49,005 --> 00:50:50,357
That's right.

907
00:50:50,382 --> 00:50:54,069
Captain Zarina
has been relieved of duty.

908
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:12,737
Ha.

909
00:51:12,738 --> 00:51:16,132
You truly are a talented fairy.

910
00:51:41,391 --> 00:51:43,684
Prepare to cast off!

911
00:51:43,685 --> 00:51:46,187
Weigh anchor and get ready to fly,
me hearties!

912
00:51:46,188 --> 00:51:47,789
Casting off!

913
00:51:51,234 --> 00:51:52,526
It's working!

914
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:55,839
I can't believe my eye!

915
00:51:57,157 --> 00:51:59,217
Weigh anchor!

916
00:52:02,287 --> 00:52:04,747
We're flying!

917
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,516
We're flying!

918
00:52:07,375 --> 00:52:08,918
It's perfect.

919
00:52:08,919 --> 00:52:10,770
We can fly!

920
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,189
Oh, my! Up, up and away!

921
00:52:14,883 --> 00:52:18,361
Shiver me timbers, we're flying!

922
00:52:21,807 --> 00:52:24,951
Bon voyage, little captain.

923
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:29,039
No!

924
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:39,382
Come on, hurry!

925
00:52:39,449 --> 00:52:40,842
Hurry!

926
00:52:44,496 --> 00:52:46,848
Help! Please!

927
00:52:46,873 --> 00:52:48,224
Help!

928
00:52:52,629 --> 00:52:54,421
Help me!

929
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,322
Here, I'll dry you off.

930
00:53:06,226 --> 00:53:07,827
We're flying!

931
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,706
Are you okay?

932
00:53:13,483 --> 00:53:15,377
You saved me.

933
00:53:15,569 --> 00:53:16,878
Why?

934
00:53:16,945 --> 00:53:20,548
Let's just say,
we're offering you quarter.

935
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,347
I'm so sorry.

936
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:31,768
They're headed for the second star.

937
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,438
If they make it past
we'll never find them.

938
00:53:36,006 --> 00:53:38,566
The blue dust will be gone forever.

939
00:53:40,176 --> 00:53:43,321
Then let's stop them
before they get there.

940
00:53:43,889 --> 00:53:45,407
Captain.

941
00:53:54,441 --> 00:53:57,484
Port, Starboard, get up the mizzen
and raise the royal.

942
00:53:57,485 --> 00:54:00,130
Aye aye, Captain!
Raising the royal!

943
00:54:04,075 --> 00:54:05,593
More pixie dust!

944
00:54:08,830 --> 00:54:11,349
Who's in the mood to plunder?

945
00:54:17,631 --> 00:54:19,232
You guys turn the ship around.

946
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:22,777
- I'm getting back that blue dust.
- Right.

947
00:54:26,306 --> 00:54:29,743
Look alive, men!
The second star, dead ahead.

948
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,956
Nothing but smooth sailing.

949
00:54:35,607 --> 00:54:36,875
Huh?

950
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,376
Yeah!

951
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:41,546
Fairies! Fairies!

952
00:54:41,613 --> 00:54:43,381
It's the fairies!

953
00:54:43,448 --> 00:54:46,843
She's back?
Well, get them off my ship.

954
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:48,720
Gladly.

955
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:57,645
It's actually quite amusing.

956
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:01,274
Stand your ground, men!

957
00:55:09,057 --> 00:55:11,183
Yang, the helm!

958
00:55:11,184 --> 00:55:12,786
Ave ave, Captain!

959
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:15,646
Ladies, until we meet again.

960
00:55:17,065 --> 00:55:19,566
- Great.
- Ha.

961
00:55:19,567 --> 00:55:22,212
You dare to fight the
captain, do you?

962
00:55:22,278 --> 00:55:24,130
Only until I get that dust.

963
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:27,342
Well, this should be fun.

964
00:55:29,828 --> 00:55:32,013
Come here, you little cuties.

965
00:55:32,497 --> 00:55:34,849
Okay, this isn't working.

966
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,418
Fawn, the spyglass!

967
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:38,895
Brilliant!

968
00:55:41,673 --> 00:55:43,024
You tiny thing.

969
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:48,446
No!

970
00:55:49,597 --> 00:55:52,200
Man overboard!

971
00:55:52,434 --> 00:55:53,952
I did it!

972
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:57,497
Stop them, you imbeciles.
They're six-inch fairies!

973
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,709
Fawn, the wheel!

974
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:07,549
Sil, whirlwind!

975
00:56:15,498 --> 00:56:17,308
Take that! Whoa, whoa...

976
00:56:19,878 --> 00:56:22,021
Blast it. The second star!

977
00:56:22,088 --> 00:56:23,756
They turned the ship around!

978
00:56:23,757 --> 00:56:25,900
Yup, we sure did.

979
00:56:26,009 --> 00:56:28,111
Get this ship back on course!

980
00:56:28,178 --> 00:56:30,655
Aye aye, Captain!

981
00:56:30,722 --> 00:56:31,823
Now!

982
00:56:34,726 --> 00:56:35,893
Why you...

983
00:56:35,894 --> 00:56:37,120
Bull's-eye!

984
00:56:39,189 --> 00:56:41,166
No fair! Come back here!

985
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:45,128
Fairies, fairies,
nothing but fairies!

986
00:56:45,612 --> 00:56:48,256
Stop moving so fast.

987
00:56:48,323 --> 00:56:51,426
Ha-ha! Just one more, pirate.

988
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:53,511
Jingle-jingle. Ha!

989
00:56:56,915 --> 00:56:59,100
Uh-oh!

990
00:57:00,543 --> 00:57:03,771
- Nice work.
- Just thinking like a Tinker.

991
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:05,940
No, no, no!
Take that, you little...

992
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:08,401
Oh, my!

993
00:57:08,468 --> 00:57:11,154
Avast, crocky! Charge!

994
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:12,721
No!

995
00:57:12,722 --> 00:57:15,057
Get it away, get it away,
get it away, get it away!

996
00:57:15,058 --> 00:57:16,451
Yeah, that's it.

997
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:19,037
Don't make me use my teaspoon.

998
00:57:19,104 --> 00:57:20,805
Oh, no. Oh, no,
you don't, you little...

999
00:57:21,981 --> 00:57:25,400
Oh! You ate my mummy's clock?

1000
00:57:25,401 --> 00:57:28,004
What was wrong with the spatula?

1001
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:31,758
Sic him!

1002
00:57:37,622 --> 00:57:39,933
Oh!
That's my crocky.

1003
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:44,419
There's nothing I
revel quite as much

1004
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,439
as a worthy opponent.

1005
00:57:49,217 --> 00:57:51,486
You're stronger than you look.

1006
00:57:53,138 --> 00:57:55,073
Hey, need some help?

1007
00:57:55,890 --> 00:57:57,659
Anchor's away!

1008
00:57:57,809 --> 00:57:59,786
Grow some seaweed, sunflower.

1009
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:10,713
Whoa!

1010
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:12,924
Ahh!

1011
00:58:14,701 --> 00:58:17,762
Now, that's some seaweed!

1012
00:58:18,997 --> 00:58:21,432
I've had just about
enough of this.

1013
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,521
Ha!

1014
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:33,719
You, too!

1015
00:58:37,265 --> 00:58:39,033
You're not going anywhere.

1016
00:58:41,394 --> 00:58:44,205
These ought to fetch
a hefty price, eh?

1017
00:58:49,736 --> 00:58:51,004
Back on course.

1018
00:59:15,053 --> 00:59:16,303
Give me that dust!

1019
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:17,530
No!

1020
00:59:36,908 --> 00:59:38,760
The dust! Not my dust!

1021
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,388
No!

1022
00:59:55,176 --> 00:59:56,760
I got the dust.

1023
00:59:56,761 --> 00:59:57,844
Oh, you're okay.

1024
00:59:57,845 --> 00:59:59,447
Oh, thank goodness.

1025
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:03,493
Let's get you out of there.

1026
01:00:05,645 --> 01:00:07,080
Lean right,

1027
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:09,231
fly right.

1028
01:00:09,232 --> 01:00:11,542
I'll take that!

1029
01:00:12,026 --> 01:00:13,961
Now, where was I?

1030
01:00:14,028 --> 01:00:17,322
Ah, yes. The second star.

1031
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:23,012
You simply don't give up.

1032
01:00:31,045 --> 01:00:33,564
Well, I guess I'm
stronger than I look.

1033
01:00:36,884 --> 01:00:37,985
The second star.

1034
01:00:44,851 --> 01:00:46,119
Oh...

1035
01:00:46,477 --> 01:00:47,578
Zarina!

1036
01:00:49,731 --> 01:00:51,916
You fought well, little fairy.

1037
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:53,793
But it's over.

1038
01:00:53,943 --> 01:00:55,545
The dust is mine.

1039
01:00:56,029 --> 01:00:58,005
The ship is mine.

1040
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:02,802
Your adventure has come to an end.

1041
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,640
Oh, go ahead, take it.

1042
01:01:07,707 --> 01:01:10,309
What's one speck between friends?

1043
01:01:13,880 --> 01:01:17,859
No, really, I think you
should have it all!

1044
01:01:17,884 --> 01:01:19,360
Huh?

1045
01:01:19,469 --> 01:01:21,529
From a trickle to a roar.

1046
01:01:25,350 --> 01:01:27,368
Whoa!

1047
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:33,940
We're free!

1048
01:01:35,526 --> 01:01:36,860
Look at him go!

1049
01:01:36,861 --> 01:01:38,296
He's very fast.

1050
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:40,214
Yeah, you think?

1051
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:45,077
Is it time to get
that blue dust back?

1052
01:01:45,078 --> 01:01:46,554
Watch this.

1053
01:01:56,297 --> 01:01:58,232
Can't fly without dust.

1054
01:01:58,299 --> 01:01:59,650
Blast!

1055
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:06,866
Goodbye, James.

1056
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:09,243
Curse you, fairies!

1057
01:02:09,644 --> 01:02:11,746
Curse you!

1058
01:02:11,813 --> 01:02:14,874
Tiny she-devils they are, really.

1059
01:02:14,899 --> 01:02:16,459
Huh?

1060
01:02:20,863 --> 01:02:23,323
Oh, no, no, no!

1061
01:02:23,324 --> 01:02:25,635
I am not a codfish!

1062
01:02:26,536 --> 01:02:28,554
I'm a pirate!

1063
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:32,225
All right.

1064
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:34,894
You got the dust!

1065
01:02:35,753 --> 01:02:37,188
We did it!

1066
01:02:38,089 --> 01:02:39,941
We can go home!

1067
01:02:40,007 --> 01:02:43,444
Oh, I'm gonna soak in a nice,
hot milkweed bath.

1068
01:02:43,845 --> 01:02:46,364
Get the smell of pirates off me.

1069
01:02:46,431 --> 01:02:47,514
That was what I was thinking.

1070
01:02:47,515 --> 01:02:49,283
You said it, Ro.

1071
01:02:51,561 --> 01:02:55,623
Here, please,
take this back to Pixie Hollow.

1072
01:03:07,326 --> 01:03:08,803
Uh, Zarina,

1073
01:03:09,412 --> 01:03:12,306
we didn't just come for the dust.

1074
01:03:17,295 --> 01:03:19,689
Oh!

1075
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:30,432
Um, Ro? There's something
you should know.

1076
01:03:30,433 --> 01:03:32,368
It's about your hair.

1077
01:03:34,103 --> 01:03:37,063
First, I lose my talent,
then I become a mother.

1078
01:03:37,064 --> 01:03:40,358
I do-si-doed in a stinky shoe,
and now, my hair?

1079
01:03:41,903 --> 01:03:45,238
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah</i>

1080
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:47,908
<i>Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah</i>

1081
01:03:47,909 --> 01:03:50,052
<i>Well, you don't know who you are</i>

1082
01:03:50,077 --> 01:03:54,015
<i>Sky is the limit
And I just wanna flow</i>

1083
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:57,542
<i>Free as a spirit on
a journey of hope</i>

1084
01:03:57,543 --> 01:03:59,395
Hang on, guys!

1085
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:02,356
<i>Cut the strings and let me go</i>

1086
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:07,278
<i>I'm weightless, I'm weightless</i>

1087
01:04:07,303 --> 01:04:10,555
<i>Millions of balloons
tethered to the ground</i>

1088
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:12,658
Hey! There it is.

1089
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:14,160
Home.

1090
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:30,885
And... now!

1091
01:04:58,854 --> 01:04:59,980
Bobble!

1092
01:05:01,607 --> 01:05:02,917
You're awake!

1093
01:05:20,459 --> 01:05:22,478
This is the best show yet!

1094
01:05:32,388 --> 01:05:33,722
Uh, girls?

1095
01:05:33,723 --> 01:05:36,784
Queen Clarion,
we got the blue dust back.

1096
01:05:37,810 --> 01:05:40,663
Which I didn't know was missing.

1097
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,582
We also got Zarina.

1098
01:05:44,358 --> 01:05:45,658
Zarina!

1099
01:05:49,572 --> 01:05:51,424
Oh, you're home!

1100
01:05:52,074 --> 01:05:54,534
Yeah. And from now on, I promise...

1101
01:05:54,535 --> 01:05:56,911
You know, Zarina's
pretty much mastered

1102
01:05:56,912 --> 01:05:58,288
that pixie dust thing of hers.

1103
01:05:58,289 --> 01:06:00,957
Yeah, she even grew
a pixie dust tree.

1104
01:06:00,958 --> 01:06:03,185
Now, we've got an extra.

1105
01:06:04,587 --> 01:06:07,148
Does this talent of
yours have a name?

1106
01:06:07,340 --> 01:06:08,774
"Alchemy."

1107
01:06:08,924 --> 01:06:10,925
Pixie dust alchemy.

1108
01:06:10,926 --> 01:06:12,927
You should really
see her in action.

1109
01:06:12,928 --> 01:06:15,823
- Oh, you definitely should.
- Very impressive.

1110
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:19,660
Hmm.

1111
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,997
Well, we do have an audience.

1112
01:06:30,905 --> 01:06:32,339
Oh!

1113
01:06:40,247 --> 01:06:41,640
Wow!

1114
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:45,478
Thanks.

1115
01:06:57,723 --> 01:06:59,742
Well, how's my hair?

1116
01:07:00,184 --> 01:07:01,494
L'£'S good!

1117
01:07:10,277 --> 01:07:11,712
Yeah!

1118
01:07:16,117 --> 01:07:17,718
Oh!

1119
01:07:42,143 --> 01:07:43,619
Whoo-hoo!

1120
01:07:59,368 --> 01:08:00,845
All right!

1121
01:08:14,258 --> 01:08:15,943
Gorgeous.

1122
01:08:19,889 --> 01:08:23,641
<i>If I could reach the
top of the world</i>

1123
01:08:23,642 --> 01:08:27,288
<i>Be all I am
It'd be so beautiful</i>

1124
01:08:28,189 --> 01:08:33,693
<i>If only I could be brave
and I could be strong</i>

1125
01:08:33,694 --> 01:08:36,529
<i>I would know where I belong</i>

1126
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,092
<i>If only</i>

1127
01:08:40,993 --> 01:08:43,620
<i>I wanna feel free to be who I am</i>

1128
01:08:43,621 --> 01:08:46,915
<i>What I'm about is
more than I've been</i>

1129
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:50,251
<i>Ready to show the world who I am</i>

1130
01:08:50,252 --> 01:08:53,713
<i>Started it out, but I'm holding in</i>

1131
01:08:53,714 --> 01:08:56,925
<i>And find my own place to stay</i>

1132
01:08:56,926 --> 01:09:00,303
<i>I can be who I am</i>

1133
01:09:05,976 --> 01:09:09,079
<i>I'm closer to what I'm meant to be</i>

1134
01:09:09,230 --> 01:09:12,458
<i>If I try I know that
I can get there</i>

1135
01:09:12,608 --> 01:09:15,502
<i>I'm not gonna stop 'cause I believe</i>

1136
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:19,965
<i>That there's so much more to me</i>

1137
01:09:23,202 --> 01:09:24,637
Man in the water!

1138
01:09:24,703 --> 01:09:26,138
Oh, dear.

1139
01:09:26,455 --> 01:09:27,806
<i>Oh, my.</i>

1140
01:09:27,915 --> 01:09:29,475
Oh!

1141
01:09:29,583 --> 01:09:31,435
That's a very nice hook.

1142
01:09:33,379 --> 01:09:35,689
Just give me a hand.

1143
01:09:35,756 --> 01:09:38,692
<i>I wanna feel free to be who I am</i>

1144
01:09:38,717 --> 01:09:42,095
<i>What I am about is
more than I've been</i>

1145
01:09:42,096 --> 01:09:45,390
<i>Ready to show the world who I am</i>

1146
01:09:45,391 --> 01:09:48,726
<i>Started it out, but I am holding in</i>

1147
01:09:48,727 --> 01:09:52,021
<i>Find my own place to stay</i>

1148
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:55,084
<i>So I can be who I am</i>

1149
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:03,342
<i>I can be who I am</i>

1150
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:06,637
<i>I can be who I am</i>

1151
01:12:10,828 --> 01:12:12,870
<i>First the Tower of London, arr!</i>

1152
01:12:12,871 --> 01:12:14,914
<i>The guards won't know what hit it</i>

1153
01:12:14,915 --> 01:12:17,083
<i>We'll swoop right down
and take the crown</i>

1154
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:18,918
<i>And the Crown Jewels with it</i>

1155
01:12:18,919 --> 01:12:20,753
<i>And when we fly to Paris</i>

1156
01:12:20,754 --> 01:12:23,089
<i>Oh, the treasures I'll be grabbin'</i>

1157
01:12:23,090 --> 01:12:25,299
<i>The Mona Lisa will look lovely</i>

1158
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,343
<i>Hanging in me cabin</i>

1159
01:12:27,344 --> 01:12:28,428
<i>Hey-ho</i>

1160
01:12:28,429 --> 01:12:30,346
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go</i>

1161
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:32,432
<i>No one can stop us
When we're so</i>

1162
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:35,601
<i>High in the stratosphere!</i>

1163
01:12:35,602 --> 01:12:36,644
<i>Hey-ho</i>

1164
01:12:36,645 --> 01:12:38,396
<i>We'll be the freighter
that plunders</i>

1165
01:12:38,397 --> 01:12:40,440
<i>Every one of the world's
seven wonders</i>

1166
01:12:40,441 --> 01:12:41,774
<i>When we're up in the skies</i>

1167
01:12:41,775 --> 01:12:43,776
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

1168
01:12:43,777 --> 01:12:47,655
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

1169
01:12:47,656 --> 01:12:49,782
<i>Next we'll roam to Rome, me lads</i>

1170
01:12:49,783 --> 01:12:51,868
<i>And here's what I'll be stealin'</i>

1171
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:53,578
<i>I'll rob the Sistine Chapel</i>

1172
01:12:53,579 --> 01:12:55,830
<i>Of the Sistine Chapel's cieilin'</i>

1173
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:57,874
<i>And for all the folks in Egypt</i>

1174
01:12:57,875 --> 01:12:59,917
<i>It will be a dismal day</i>

1175
01:12:59,918 --> 01:13:01,961
<i>They'll be crying for their mummies</i>

1176
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:04,297
<i>When we take their mummies away!</i>

1177
01:13:04,298 --> 01:13:05,590
<i>Hey-ho</i>

1178
01:13:05,591 --> 01:13:07,425
<i>Imagine the places that we'll go</i>

1179
01:13:07,426 --> 01:13:09,969
<i>No can stop us when we're so high!</i>

1180
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:12,513
<i>They will all cower in fear</i>

1181
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:15,183
<i>Hey-ho, from Delhi to Rio to Venice</i>

1182
01:13:15,184 --> 01:13:17,143
<i>There's no city that
we will not menace</i>

1183
01:13:17,144 --> 01:13:18,686
<i>When we're up in the skies</i>

1184
01:13:18,687 --> 01:13:20,730
<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

1185
01:13:20,731 --> 01:13:24,692
<i>No one can fight a
frigate that flies</i>

1186
01:13:24,693 --> 01:13:28,446
<i>- Oh, how high we will be!
- We will be</i>

1187
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:32,366
<i>'Cause the blue fairy dust
Surely packs a mighty wallop</i>

1188
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:33,576
<i>Only takes a dollop</i>

1189
01:13:33,577 --> 01:13:36,662
<i>- Soon it will set us free
- We'll be free</i>

1190
01:13:36,663 --> 01:13:38,873
<i>From the chains of gravity</i>

1191
01:13:38,874 --> 01:13:40,958
<i>Then we'll hoist up the sail</i>

1192
01:13:40,959 --> 01:13:43,086
<i>And we'll set course for the sun</i>

1193
01:13:43,087 --> 01:13:44,921
<i>'Cause when you've got wings</i>

1194
01:13:44,922 --> 01:13:47,006
<i>No wicked deed cannot be done</i>

1195
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,008
<i>And we owe it all</i>

1196
01:13:49,009 --> 01:13:53,280
<i>To our great and glorious captain</i>

1197
01:13:53,931 --> 01:13:55,640
<i>Two, three, four!</i>

1198
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:58,601
<i>Hey-ho, imagine the
places that we'll go</i>

1199
01:13:58,602 --> 01:14:01,229
<i>No one can stop us
when we're so high</i>

1200
01:14:01,230 --> 01:14:03,815
<i>- Givin' a pirate cheer
- Arr!</i>

1201
01:14:03,816 --> 01:14:06,567
<i>Hey-ho, we'll be the
freighter that plunders</i>

1202
01:14:06,568 --> 01:14:08,611
<i>Every one of the
world's seven wonders</i>

<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

1205
01:14:11,990 --> 01:14:14,951
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a town or a county</i>

1206
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:17,620
<i>That will not yield its bounty up</i>

1207
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:20,164
<i>When our ship draws near</i>

1208
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:23,126
<i>Hey-ho, there's not
a city or village</i>

1209
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:25,128
<i>That we will not plunder or pillage</i>

1210
01:14:25,129 --> 01:14:26,420
<i>When we're up in the skies</i>

1211

<i>For who can fight a
frigate that flies?</i>

1212
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:32,552
<i>And every nation
will give a donation</i>

1213
01:14:32,553 --> 01:14:35,805
<i>When they see us sail the skies</i>

1214
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:38,015
<i>In a frigate that flies!</i>

1215
01:14:38,016 --> 01:14:39,409
<i>Hey!</i>
