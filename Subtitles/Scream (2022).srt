Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

00:01:40,134 --> 00:01:42,003
- Hello?
- <i>Hello.</i>

4
00:01:42,502 --> 00:01:43,804
<i>Is Cristina there?</i>

5
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,606
No, she's not available.
May I take a message?

6
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,375
<i>Uh, yeah, well, um...</i>

7
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,409
<i>Yeah, sorry. I'm a friend
from her group...</i>

8
00:01:49,542 --> 00:01:51,411
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

9
00:01:51,544 --> 00:01:53,180
From her shit?

10
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,616
<i>Um...
Look, just tell her I'm from group.</i>

11
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,919
<i>I'm Charlie.
She's got my number.</i>

12
00:01:58,052 --> 00:01:59,754
Oh, she goes to your group?

13
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:01,856
<i>I shouldn't have, um...</i>

14
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,424
<i>Look, just tell her
Charlie called.</i>

15
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:06,394
And I will do
exactly that, Charlie,

16
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:08,696
once you tell me what kind
of group we're talking about.

17
00:02:08,829 --> 00:02:10,898
- Is it AA? NA?
- <i>Look...</i>

18
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:13,500
<i>You sound exactly like
she describes you.</i>

19
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:15,535
Uh,
does she talk about me in group?

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,239
<i>I don't think I
can really talk about that.</i>

21
00:02:18,372 --> 00:02:20,408
What does she say about me?

22
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:22,310
<i>Well, she loves you very much.</i>

23
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,211
What does she love about me?

24
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:27,480
<i>Oh, okay. Well...</i>

25
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,582
<i>She loves that you're creative.</i>

26
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:32,086
<i>You love art
and TV and movies.</i>

27
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,554
Okay, well,
lots of people love movies.

28
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:37,725
<i>Yeah, but she says
you love scary movies</i>

29
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:39,994
<i>and that you guys
have that in common.</i>

30
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:42,697
<i>She's proud
of making a fan out of you.</i>

31
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,099
- She is?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

32
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,501
<i>Well, she told me the other
day, she wonders...</i>

33
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:51,072
<i>what's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

34
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,606
Uh... <i>The Babadook.</i>

35
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,976
It's an amazing meditation
on motherhood and grief.

36
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:59,847
<i>Isn't that
a little fancy pants?</i>

37
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:01,649
Well, it's elevated horror.

38
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:05,518
<i>Uh-huh.
What does that mean, "Elevated horror"?</i>

39
00:03:05,653 --> 00:03:09,423
You know, it's scary but with complex
emotional and thematic underpinnings.

40
00:03:09,556 --> 00:03:13,894
It's not just some schlocky, cheeseball
nonsense with wall-to-wall jump scares.

41
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:17,431
<i>Hmm.
Sounds kind of boring to me.</i>

42
00:03:17,564 --> 00:03:19,867
<i>Have you ever seen</i> Stab?

43
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:22,770
Once, I think.

44
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:25,239
At a sleepover
when I was, like, 12.

45
00:03:26,407 --> 00:03:30,277
<i>You live in Woodsboro
and you don't know</i> Stab?

46
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:31,679
<i>Your mother loves that movie.</i>

47
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,415
<i>She talks about it
all the time in group.</i>

48
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,717
<i>How well do you remember
the original?</i>

49
00:03:36,851 --> 00:03:38,319
I don't know.

50
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,721
I mean, it was super '90s.

51
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:44,557
It was really over-lit
and everyone had weird hair.

52
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:48,195
<i>Uh-huh.
Do you remember the beginning?</i>

53
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,930
Not really.

54
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:51,465
It started with
a kill scene, right?

55
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,000
They always started
with a kill scene.

56
00:03:53,134 --> 00:03:55,568
<i>Yeah, that's right.
That's right.</i>

57
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:58,005
<i>It's a girl at home, alone.</i>

58
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:01,675
<i>She answers a wrong number and
starts talking with the killer</i>

59
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:04,145
<i>who makes her play a game.</i>

60
00:04:05,146 --> 00:04:07,882
<i>Would you like to
play a game...</i>

61
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,917
<i>Tara?</i>

62
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,599
<i>All systems armed.</i>

63
00:05:34,902 --> 00:05:37,104
This isn't fucking funny, Amber.

64
00:05:37,238 --> 00:05:40,908
<i>I told you, this isn't Amber.</i>

65
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,415
<i>Amber's looking
particularly fetching tonight.</i>

66
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:53,654
<i>She really shouldn't leave her phone
lying around for anyone to clone.</i>

67
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:55,422
What do you want?

68
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:59,026
<i>I told you,
I want to play a game.</i>

69
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,895
Stab <i>movie trivia,</i>
<i>three rounds.</i>

70
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,563
<i>You call the cops,
she dies.</i>

71
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:04,598
<i>You get a question wrong,
she dies.</i>

72
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:06,133
<i>Her parents aren't home.</i>

73
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:09,003
<i>I can be in that room
in 15 seconds.</i>

74
00:06:09,136 --> 00:06:11,906
<i>You want a warmup question?</i>

75
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:14,808
I told you
I don't know these movies!

76
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,377
Ask me about something
I do know.

77
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:19,480
Ask me about <i>It Follows.</i>
Ask me about <i>Hereditary.</i>

78
00:06:19,614 --> 00:06:20,881
Ask me about <i>The Witch.</i>

79
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:23,050
<i>In the first</i> Stab <i>movie,</i>

80
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,952
<i>what Woodsboro native
was introduced</i>

81
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:27,888
<i>as the franchise's
main character?</i>

82
00:06:28,856 --> 00:06:30,357
It's Sidney Prescott!

83
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,459
It's Sidney Prescott
and she lived on Elm.

84
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:35,664
<i>Correct. You see,
you're gonna do great at this.</i>

85
00:06:35,796 --> 00:06:37,798
<i>Okay, question one...</i>

86
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,201
No, I got that one right.
It should count.

87
00:06:40,334 --> 00:06:42,002
<i>Anyone could have
gotten that one right.</i>

88
00:06:42,136 --> 00:06:44,572
<i>Sidney's in every movie
but the last one.</i>

89
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,906
<i>Question one:</i>

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,908
<i>Who wrote the original book</i>

91
00:06:48,042 --> 00:06:50,978
<i>that the</i> Stab <i>movies</i>
<i>are based on?</i>

92
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,983
Um... Um...

93
00:06:56,116 --> 00:06:58,052
The... The chick from TV!

94
00:06:58,185 --> 00:07:01,889
<i>"The chick from TV"
is not gonna cut it, Tara.</i>

95
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,792
Gale Weathers!

96
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,994
It is Gale Weathers,
you motherfucker!

97
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,329
<i>Correct.</i>

98
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:10,564
<i>Amber might live
to see the sunrise.</i>

99
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:14,768
<i>Question two: Who played the dumb
bitch in the beginning of</i> Stab 1

100
00:07:14,902 --> 00:07:19,039
<i>who answers the phone and
gets carved up by the killer?</i>

101
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,341
Fuck you.

102
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,509
<i>Is that the answer
you're going with?</i>

103
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,916
<i>A non-answer
counts as a wrong answer, Tara.</i>

104
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,451
<i>Time's running out.</i>

105
00:07:30,584 --> 00:07:36,457
<i>Ticktock, ticktock,
ticktock, ticktock...</i>

106
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:38,525
Heather Graham!

107
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:42,429
<i>Correct!
You pulled that one out.</i>

108
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:45,065
<i>Now for the final question:</i>

109
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:49,870
<i>Who was the killer in</i> Stab 1?

110
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,440
Oh, I know this one, you fuck.

111
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,476
It's Billy Loomis!

112
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,411
It's Billy Loomis,
and he was Sidney's boyfriend,

113
00:07:57,544 --> 00:08:00,547
he was played by Luke Wilson,
and I got you, asshole!

114
00:08:01,382 --> 00:08:04,985
I got it! I got it right!

115
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,057
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, Tara,
but that's just not correct.</i>

116
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:11,760
What?

117
00:08:11,892 --> 00:08:14,495
No, no, it is. It is.
That is right.

118
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,532
<i>The correct answer
is Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.</i>

119
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:21,502
<i>There are two killers</i>
<i>in the original</i> Stab.

120
00:08:21,636 --> 00:08:24,905
<i>I'm afraid someone's
got to die now.</i>

121
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,841
No, no, no.
Amber, I'm coming.

122
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:32,146
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

123
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,598
<i>All systems armed.</i>

124
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:01,308
The police are on their way,
asshole!

125
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:13,187
<i>All systems disarmed.</i>

126
00:09:15,289 --> 00:09:17,224
<i>All systems armed.</i>

127
00:09:20,194 --> 00:09:22,162
- <i>All systems disarmed.</i>
- Oh, my God. No.

128
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,064
<i>All systems armed.</i>

129
00:09:24,198 --> 00:09:27,501
<i>All systems disarmed.
All systems armed.</i>

130
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:28,837
<i>All systems disarmed.</i>

<i>All systems armed.</i>

132
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,038
Hello?

133
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,075
<i>Bonus question, Tara.</i>

134
00:10:09,143 --> 00:10:10,612
Please stop.

135
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:13,180
<i>Do you think
I made it inside your house</i>

136
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,249
<i>before you could rearm?</i>

137
00:10:56,457 --> 00:10:57,692
Help!

138
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:12,973
No! No, no, no!

139
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:45,339
Excuse me, miss?

140
00:11:45,472 --> 00:11:47,842
- What'd you just take?
- Your boner pills.

141
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,344
Good luck getting it up now.

142
00:11:50,979 --> 00:11:52,279
You, um...

143
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,749
You are my boner pills.

144
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:59,086
No. No.

145
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:10,597
You okay?

146
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:12,232
Yes.

147
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:15,302
You don't have to check on me all the time.
I'm not breakable.

148
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,170
Yeah, this I know.

149
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:22,710
Shit.

150
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:32,486
- <i>Sam?</i>
- Hey. What's going on?

151
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:37,457
<i>Uh, Tara...

152
00:12:38,793 --> 00:12:40,127
What? Is she...

00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,263
<i>She's alive,

154

<i>She was...</i>

155
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,301
<i>stabbed.</i>

156
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:49,938
- Stabbed? What the fuck?
- <i>She made it through surgery</i>

157
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,706
<i>and the doctor
said it went well.</i>

158
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,440
<i>She's resting now.</i>

159
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:55,610
<i>I know you guys
aren't on the best terms, but...</i>

160
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,077
I'm on my way.

161
00:12:57,210 --> 00:13:00,048
<i>She's gonna be okay, Sam.
We'll see you soon.</i>

162
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,784
- Hey, wait, Wes!
- <i>Yeah?</i>

163
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:05,787
Do they know who did this?

164
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,122
<i>It's probably better
if you just come here.</i>

165
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:10,557
Wes.

166
00:13:10,692 --> 00:13:12,192
<i>She said it was someone</i>

167
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:14,394
<i>in a fucking Ghostface mask.</i>

168
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:23,738
My sister was attacked.

169
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,674
I gotta go.

170
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:29,209
Wait, hey! Hey, hey hey.
I'm... I'm going with you.

171
00:13:29,343 --> 00:13:33,180
- No. No, Richie...
- No, Sam. I'm coming with you.

172
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,850
- Okay.
- Okay. Yeah.

173
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:39,887
<i>Attention, Panthers.</i>

174
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:43,256
<i>A reminder that all classes
and school activities</i>

175
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,761
<i>are canceled tomorrow
due to public safety concerns.</i>

176
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:47,862
That was Sam.

177
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:50,497
- She's coming?
- Yeah.

178
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,934
Watch everything get worse.

179
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,737
All I'm saying is,
with everything going on right now,

180
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:00,273
I think it's time we take our relationship
to the next, most intimate level.

181
00:14:00,407 --> 00:14:02,644
He wants me to accept
his Find My Fam request.

182
00:14:02,777 --> 00:14:05,647
It's the smartest option with
a would-be killer on the loose.

183
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:08,281
You know exactly where I am and
I know exactly where you are.

184
00:14:08,415 --> 00:14:10,283
Aw, you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend.

185
00:14:10,417 --> 00:14:12,285
And you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend.

186
00:14:13,855 --> 00:14:15,522
Is this because you two
aren't having sex yet?

187
00:14:15,657 --> 00:14:17,190
You bring up a very good point.

188
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:19,393
Not that I want to sound
like a stereotypical jock

189
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,561
- trying to get into his girl's pants...
- Great!

190
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,965
Don't do it, Liv.
There's a psycho out there.

191
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:25,365
You make yourself
harder to find.

192
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:26,901
Delete social media,
tape over your phone camera,

193
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,201
disable GPS.

194
00:14:28,335 --> 00:14:30,170
Yes, thank you very much,
Edward Snowden.

195
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:33,173
Actually, your mother just interrogated
me about Tara's attempted murder,

196
00:14:33,306 --> 00:14:34,942
which was very fun.

197
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,846
I'm sure she's asking everybody.
I mean, Ghostface is back.

198
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,514
The press
still isn't saying Ghostface.

199
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:41,949
My mom doesn't want
to cause a panic.

200
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:43,851
It'll get out by the second
or third killing.

201
00:14:43,985 --> 00:14:47,789
Jesus, Mindy, there wasn't
a first killing. Tara's alive.

202
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:50,792
- Mmm. I mean, she could still die.
- What the fuck?

203
00:14:50,925 --> 00:14:52,225
Or the killer
could come back for her.

204
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,493
Fuck! Mindy, come on.

205
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:55,262
I'm just telling you,
arm up, okay?

206
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,397
Pepper spray, check.
Taser, check.

207
00:14:57,531 --> 00:14:58,866
Girlfriend repellent, check.

208
00:15:00,168 --> 00:15:01,969
Nice. Thank you.

209
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:05,740
Holy shit.
Is that... Vince?

210
00:15:05,873 --> 00:15:08,142
Wait. The creep
you hooked up with last summer?

211
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:12,446
- Yeah. He worked with me and Tara.
- He worked with Tara?

212
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,315
He's been stalking my Instagram
the last couple weeks,

213
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,418
posting the creepiest shit.

214
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:20,655
Probably time to introduce him
to Hobbs and Shaw.

215
00:15:20,788 --> 00:15:23,290
Maybe not the best idea
to incite violence

216
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,093
right in front
of the sheriff.

217
00:15:25,225 --> 00:15:26,861
Looks like he's leaving.

218
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,930
Thanks anyways, boys.

219
00:15:29,063 --> 00:15:30,530
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

220
00:15:30,665 --> 00:15:33,266
Hmm. Tara says
she fought back hard.

221
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,635
You've got bruises.

222
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:36,236
It's from football practice.

223
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:39,473
- Oh, sure.
- Tara's awake. She just texted.

224
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,374
I'm going to the hospital.
You guys coming?

225
00:15:41,508 --> 00:15:42,977
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

226
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:44,578
Oh, uh...
I can't,

227
00:15:44,712 --> 00:15:46,080
but I'll meet
you guys there.

228
00:15:46,214 --> 00:15:47,749
All right.

229
00:15:57,024 --> 00:16:00,027
- I've actually never seen <i>Stab.</i>
- You've never seen <i>Stab?</i>

230
00:16:00,161 --> 00:16:03,030
- Mmm.
- Not even the one that came out last year?

231
00:16:03,164 --> 00:16:05,099
I've never seen
<i>Gone with the Wind</i> either,

232
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,803
but I don't consider it, like,
a huge hole in my cinematic education.

233
00:16:08,936 --> 00:16:12,640
Most of the <i>Stab</i> movies are based
on things that happened here.

234
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:14,742
Define "things."

235
00:16:14,876 --> 00:16:15,810
Things like...

236
00:16:15,943 --> 00:16:18,311
a guy named Billy Loomis
and his friend

237
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,148
carved up a bunch
of high-school kids

238
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,050
while wearing
this Halloween ghost mask.

239
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:24,986
You mean like
in <i>Halloween?</i>

240
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,455
- No. Not like in <i>Halloween.</i>
- Oh.

241
00:16:29,523 --> 00:16:30,958
Sounds a lot
like <i>Halloween.</i>

242
00:16:31,092 --> 00:16:32,994
- All right, it's a little like <i>Halloween.</i>
- Okay.

243
00:16:33,127 --> 00:16:37,098
And every decade or so,
some idiot gets the bright idea

244
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:40,234
to put on the mask, kill his
friends, and get famous too.

245
00:16:40,367 --> 00:16:42,469
The last time it happened
was in 2011.

246
00:16:42,603 --> 00:16:44,504
And we came here
voluntarily?

247
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,041
Well, I got to make sure
Tara's okay.

248
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:48,810
Right. Yes, of course.

249
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:50,945
And I got to make sure we don't
get sliced up by some lunatic

250
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:53,047
who saw <i>Friday the 13th</i> and
thought, "You know what?

251
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:57,084
That Jason guy,
he's got some pretty solid ideas."

252
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:00,587
Can I ask you
one question though?

253
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:01,454
Yeah.

254
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,090
Do you have any idea why

255
00:17:03,224 --> 00:17:06,761
someone wearing that mask
would want to kill your sister?

256
00:17:07,762 --> 00:17:08,963
No.

257
00:17:29,516 --> 00:17:31,085
How are you feeling?

258
00:17:31,953 --> 00:17:32,887
You came.

259
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,655
Of course I came.

260
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,158
This is my boyfriend,
Richie.

261
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:40,127
It's so nice to meet you.
I'm so sorry if I'm intruding.

262
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:41,796
Nice to meet you too.

263
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,432
Hi.

264
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,636
- Thank you for calling.
- Of course.

265
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:52,572
Look at your hair!
I like it.

266
00:17:52,707 --> 00:17:55,610
These are Chad and Mindy,
the twins. And Wes.

267
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:56,944
I used to babysit them all.

268
00:17:57,078 --> 00:17:59,247
Which is always how
I like to be introduced.

269
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:02,850
And Amber. Hey.

270
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,518
Hi. Nice to see you.

271
00:18:05,653 --> 00:18:07,587
Hi. I'm Richie.

272
00:18:07,722 --> 00:18:08,890
Hi.

273
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,124
Where's Mom?

274
00:18:10,258 --> 00:18:11,391
She's stuck
at a conference in London.

275
00:18:11,524 --> 00:18:12,627
She called me earlier.

276
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,929
Yeah, for all of ten minutes.

277
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:18,299
Uh, look, guys,
Tara's really tired.

278
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:20,001
Maybe we should
just give her some space.

279
00:18:20,134 --> 00:18:21,302
Yeah.

280
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:23,004
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

281
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:26,473
Not you, Sam.

282
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:28,876
I want you to stay.

283
00:18:29,409 --> 00:18:30,344
Okay.

284
00:18:30,477 --> 00:18:32,046
- But the rest.
- Yeah.

285
00:18:33,915 --> 00:18:37,985
If it's okay with you,
I could sleep here tonight.

286
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:39,854
I'd really like that.

287
00:18:39,987 --> 00:18:41,088
Okay.

288
00:18:41,222 --> 00:18:43,791
- Do you have your extra inhaler?
- I'll be fine.

289
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:44,959
Okay.

290
00:18:48,029 --> 00:18:49,096
Bye.

291
00:18:49,230 --> 00:18:50,865
- Okay, I'll be right outside.
- Thank you.

292
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:52,199
Bye.

293
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:03,811
Sam,
I was so scared.

294
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:07,248
I know. It's okay.

295
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,088
<i>So what is she like,
the sister?</i>

296
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,957
Sam?
Oh, Sam is so cool.

297
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,725
You only say that
because she let you

298
00:19:17,858 --> 00:19:19,492
wear Pokémon onesies
to bed for a year.

299
00:19:19,627 --> 00:19:21,963
True. That's a true statement.

300
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:25,666
No, trust me. Sam is not cool.
Her dad left her mom, right?

301
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,669
Walks right out when Tara's
eight, Sam's 13.

302
00:19:28,803 --> 00:19:31,238
Sam started acting out,
getting in trouble with the cops.

303
00:19:31,372 --> 00:19:35,343
And then, on Sam's 18th
birthday, she leaves.

304
00:19:35,475 --> 00:19:36,576
Ghosts them all.

305
00:19:36,711 --> 00:19:38,612
Maybe Sam's changed.

306
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,381
I just don't want
to see Tara hurt again.

307
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:44,018
So what, you're protecting Tara
from her own sister now?

308
00:19:44,151 --> 00:19:45,585
Well, someone has to.

309
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,855
Okay, so no guys
are good enough for her,

310
00:19:47,989 --> 00:19:49,623
and now her family's
off-limits too?

311
00:19:49,757 --> 00:19:51,558
Mmm, motive.

312
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,394
"If I can't have her,
no one can."

313
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:54,561
What?

314
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:56,163
We know
you have a crush on Tara.

315
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:57,597
Okay.
Come on, Mindy.

316
00:19:57,732 --> 00:19:59,867
But we're all suspects.

317
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,740
- Except maybe Liv.
- Thank you.

318
00:20:05,873 --> 00:20:07,274
You're way too boring
to be a psycho.

319
00:20:07,408 --> 00:20:09,810
Yo, Liv.
You want a real drink?

320
00:20:09,944 --> 00:20:12,413
Or are you happy sitting
at this kids' table?

321
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,816
Listen up, uglier Michael
Myers, it was a summer fling.

322
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,685
- It meant nothing.
- Was I talking to you?

323
00:20:17,818 --> 00:20:18,986
I don't care
who you're talking to.

324
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,621
- Liv, let's go.
- Don't talk to her!

325
00:20:20,755 --> 00:20:22,356
I don't want to hear
your voice.

326
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,724
- Shut the fuck up.
- Hey!

327
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:26,160
Get out of here
or I'm calling the cops.

328
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,695
Go!

329
00:20:27,828 --> 00:20:29,864
- I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
- Hey, man, fuck you.

330
00:20:29,997 --> 00:20:32,166
You kids too! Let's go!

331
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:34,969
Do you see this shit?

332
00:20:37,772 --> 00:20:39,974
Fuck this bar, man.

333
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:45,913
Fuck you.

334
00:20:50,051 --> 00:20:51,285
Fuck it!

335
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,923
What the fuck?

336
00:21:09,103 --> 00:21:10,771
What the fuck?

337
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,178
Is that you, pretty boy? Huh?

338
00:21:17,311 --> 00:21:19,713
Get out of my fucking car!

339
00:22:10,498 --> 00:22:11,866
Hey.

340
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,136
- You okay?
- Yeah.

341
00:22:15,636 --> 00:22:17,204
Just a bad dream.

342
00:22:17,771 --> 00:22:19,340
What are you watching?

343
00:22:19,473 --> 00:22:22,042
Oh, <i>Stab</i> is on Netflix.

344
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:26,147
What?
I want to be prepared.

345
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:28,749
I got to go
find something to eat.

346
00:22:28,883 --> 00:22:30,317
Yeah, okay.

347
00:22:53,674 --> 00:22:55,009
How you doing, Sam?

348
00:22:57,811 --> 00:23:02,449
Mmm. Antipsychotics aren't working
as well as they used to, are they?

349
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:03,817
Fuck you.

350
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:07,054
You can't run
from who you are, Sam.

351
00:23:07,188 --> 00:23:08,989
I'm just trying to help.

352
00:23:10,024 --> 00:23:14,428
Hey, when are you gonna tell her
why all this is happening?

353
00:23:18,699 --> 00:23:22,870
<i>Blue team, ICU.</i>

354
00:23:29,276 --> 00:23:30,444
Hello.

355
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:32,880
<i>Hello, Samantha.</i>

356
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:37,284
Who is this?

357
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:40,487
<i>Someone who knows
your little family secret.</i>

358
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:44,058
You're the fuck
who hurt my sister?

359
00:23:44,191 --> 00:23:46,994
<i>Oh, she's not
the only one I'm gonna hurt.</i>

360
00:23:47,127 --> 00:23:51,899
<i>I had to get you to come
back here somehow, didn't I?</i>

361
00:23:52,032 --> 00:23:54,201
You want to fuck with me,
asshole?

362
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:56,605
I'm right here. Come and get me.

363
00:23:56,737 --> 00:23:58,505
<i>With pleasure.</i>

364
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:14,989
Help!

365
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,865
Help! Help!

366
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:27,935
Somebody help me!
He's trying to kill me!

367
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,871
What's going on?
You're okay.

368
00:24:31,005 --> 00:24:33,140
Somebody tried to kill me
in the break room!

369
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:46,721
I've got a body
outside a bar on Main,

370
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,289
and now you get attacked here.

371
00:24:48,422 --> 00:24:50,090
You said the call came
from Amber's number?

372
00:24:50,224 --> 00:24:53,027
So? We know he cloned my phone
before when he attacked Tara.

373
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,497
Or, and I'm just
spit-balling here...

374
00:24:56,631 --> 00:24:57,798
you're the killer.

375
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,933
And where were you
when all this happened?

376
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:02,903
I was...
watching Netflix.

377
00:25:03,037 --> 00:25:06,340
- Yeah. Super-solid alibi, bro.
- So where were you?

378
00:25:06,473 --> 00:25:08,942
I was questioning her
at the sheriff's station.

379
00:25:09,076 --> 00:25:10,477
Yeah,
I came as soon as I heard.

380
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:12,379
But, you know,
the Netflix alibi is good, too.

381
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:13,615
Both of you,
stop it.

382
00:25:13,748 --> 00:25:15,449
You're gonna put more cops
on her room, right?

383
00:25:15,582 --> 00:25:16,950
Yes.

384
00:25:17,084 --> 00:25:18,620
And I can move you
to a private floor.

385
00:25:18,753 --> 00:25:20,988
Deputy Vinson knows what he's doing.
You'll be safe.

386
00:25:21,121 --> 00:25:22,556
Like we've been so far?

387
00:25:24,191 --> 00:25:26,193
Samantha,
let's step outside.

388
00:25:30,164 --> 00:25:32,866
Nice to see you,
Deputy Hicks.

389
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,469
- So many fun memories.
- It's "Sheriff" Hicks.

390
00:25:35,603 --> 00:25:37,338
I remember you too...

391
00:25:37,471 --> 00:25:40,140
and all the trouble
you used to cause your family.

392
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,110
Your presence here
is not helping.

393
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:44,878
So maybe when the sun comes up,

394
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:46,580
you and your boyfriend
can hit the road

395
00:25:46,715 --> 00:25:49,516
and leave it to people who
actually care about this community.

396
00:26:03,097 --> 00:26:04,699
Well,
she remains a delight.

397
00:26:04,833 --> 00:26:06,133
Are you okay?

398
00:26:06,266 --> 00:26:08,435
Um, would you mind
giving us a second?

399
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,003
I need to talk to Tara.

400
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,405
Come on, Netflix.
Let's go.

401
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,991
Do you remember
when Dad left?

402
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:33,527
Parts, sure.

403
00:26:35,496 --> 00:26:37,464
I was eight. I don't know what
that has to do with anything.

404
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:39,400
It has to do with it.

405
00:26:43,671 --> 00:26:45,439
Do you remember how...

406
00:26:45,572 --> 00:26:48,142
Mom used to keep those boxes
up in the attic?

407
00:26:49,276 --> 00:26:50,944
Well, I was up there once,

408
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:54,616
when I was 13,
looking for Christmas presents.

409
00:26:54,749 --> 00:26:57,985
And I found these old diaries
that she kept from high school.

410
00:26:58,118 --> 00:27:00,087
- Sam, what is...
- Please.

411
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,022
I just... I have to do this.

412
00:27:02,156 --> 00:27:03,825
So I found these old diaries.

413
00:27:04,692 --> 00:27:07,594
And I knew it was wrong,
but I read some anyway

414
00:27:07,729 --> 00:27:09,898
because Mom got pregnant
with me in high school,

415
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,333
and I thought it could be cool to
find out how she and Dad got together.

416
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:15,536
How romantic
it must have been.

417
00:27:16,671 --> 00:27:18,172
So I read some.

418
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,308
Only it wasn't romantic.

419
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,978
Mom was dating Dad, but...

420
00:27:26,013 --> 00:27:28,883
she was in love
with this other guy...

421
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:31,084
and he got her pregnant.

422
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,020
She told Dad it was his,

423
00:27:33,153 --> 00:27:34,354
and that's why
he proposed senior year.

424
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:35,589
Sam, what are you talking about?

425
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:38,058
And I'm sitting there,
in this attic,

426
00:27:38,626 --> 00:27:40,160
and I'm 13...

427
00:27:40,294 --> 00:27:44,097
and I just found out
my dad isn't my dad.

428
00:27:45,667 --> 00:27:50,103
So I go find Mom in her bedroom,
and I'm screaming at her

429
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:52,841
and shoving this diary
in her face,

430
00:27:52,973 --> 00:27:55,008
and I didn't even realize...

431
00:27:55,142 --> 00:27:57,578
that Dad was standing
right behind me.

432
00:27:59,647 --> 00:28:01,415
He didn't know.

433
00:28:04,051 --> 00:28:06,420
He found out right then from me.

434
00:28:09,891 --> 00:28:11,558
He left that night.

435
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:14,261
I'm the reason he left.

436
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:15,730
No.

437
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:17,966
- No, Sam...
- Mom never forgave me.

438
00:28:18,098 --> 00:28:22,135
Then she made me promise never to
tell you because you were so young.

439
00:28:23,403 --> 00:28:25,372
And that's why I changed

440
00:28:25,506 --> 00:28:30,143
and I got distant
and weird with you.

441
00:28:32,012 --> 00:28:34,214
And I went out
and I started doing

442
00:28:34,348 --> 00:28:37,217
every drug
that I could get my hands on

443
00:28:37,351 --> 00:28:40,087
until I couldn't take it anymore
and I left town.

444
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:43,257
I just couldn't be
around you anymore, Tara.

445
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:46,026
Not only because I destroyed
our family that night,

446
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,427
but because...

447
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:51,064
those diaries told me
who my real father was.

448
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:56,136
It was Billy Loomis.

449
00:28:57,104 --> 00:28:58,272
And somebody knows,

450
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:00,107
and I think
that's why you got hurt.

451
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,878
And I'm so fucking sorry that I
never told you and that I ran away.

452
00:29:04,012 --> 00:29:05,345
- I'm so sorry.
- Get out.

453
00:29:05,479 --> 00:29:06,814
Tara.

454
00:29:06,948 --> 00:29:09,149
You're gone
for five years...

455
00:29:09,717 --> 00:29:10,785
Five whole years.

456
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,820
And then I get stabbed
and you want to come back

457
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:14,421
and drop
all this shit on me?

458
00:29:14,555 --> 00:29:17,625
- I thought I was protecting you.
- Protecting me from what?

459
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:21,228
The truth?

460
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,096
No.

461
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,633
- No, I... Please, Tara.
- Sam.

462
00:29:25,767 --> 00:29:28,903
- I need you to get the fuck out.
- I'm so sorry.

463
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:30,203
- Sam.
- Please.

464
00:29:30,337 --> 00:29:32,339
Get the fuck out!

465
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:54,227
Hey, hey. It's okay, it's me.

466
00:29:55,997 --> 00:29:57,665
Were you listening
at the door?

467
00:29:58,298 --> 00:30:00,200
No, no,
of course not.

468
00:30:01,134 --> 00:30:03,605
Okay, yeah,
I was listening at the door.

469
00:30:04,204 --> 00:30:05,740
It doesn't freak you out...

470
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:08,876
that my real father
was a serial killer?

471
00:30:09,576 --> 00:30:10,678
I mean...

472
00:30:11,144 --> 00:30:12,446
yeah.

473
00:30:12,981 --> 00:30:14,348
A great deal, yeah.

474
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:17,384
Okay, well, then go.
I get it.

475
00:30:18,585 --> 00:30:20,454
I just got to stay
and figure it out.

476
00:30:20,587 --> 00:30:22,356
I'm not leaving you here, Sam.

477
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,892
You know that part
in horror movies

478
00:30:25,026 --> 00:30:27,194
where you want to yell
at the characters to be smart

479
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,896
and get the fuck out?

480
00:30:29,964 --> 00:30:32,332
This is that part, Richie.

481
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:34,368
You should get the fuck out.

482
00:30:38,405 --> 00:30:39,641
But I'm staying.

483
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,612
I love you.

484
00:30:48,983 --> 00:30:52,552
- You're such a dumbass.
- I'm such a dumbass.

485
00:30:53,788 --> 00:30:54,956
So...

486
00:30:55,089 --> 00:30:57,290
your sister won't talk to you.

487
00:30:58,059 --> 00:30:59,861
The police aren't gonna help.

488
00:30:59,994 --> 00:31:01,629
What's our next move?

489
00:31:04,164 --> 00:31:05,867
We go talk to an expert.

490
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:11,806
<i>...temperatures
here Tuesday, Wednesday in the mid-50s,</i>

491
00:31:11,939 --> 00:31:14,876
<i>and then finally we'll see those
mid-60s returning next week.</i>

492
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:18,345
<i>Just one night after a
local teen was attacked in her home</i>

493
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,715
<i>by an assailant
wearing a Ghostface costume,</i>

494
00:31:20,848 --> 00:31:23,785
<i>Sheriff Judy Hicks has now confirmed
two more late-night attacks</i>

495
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,820
<i>that have left Woodsboro
reeling.</i>

496
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,587
<i>The first victim,
Vincent Schneider,</i>

497
00:31:27,722 --> 00:31:30,158
<i>was found dead behind
the Corner Pocket Pool Hall.</i>

498
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,126
<i>A second victim,
as yet unnamed,</i>

499
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:36,430
<i>was attacked inside Woodsboro General
Hospital, but escaped without injuries.</i>

500
00:31:36,563 --> 00:31:39,133
<i>Needless to say, Woodsboro
is on high alert today...</i>

501
00:31:39,266 --> 00:31:42,502
<i>Live from Studio
1-A in Rockefeller Plaza...</i>

502
00:31:42,637 --> 00:31:44,271
<i>Good morning.
I'm Gale Weathers.</i>

503
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:47,675
<i>Before we dive in,
I want to tell you a little story</i>

504
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:50,377
<i>that happened on the way
into the studio this morning.</i>

505
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:52,680
<i>I stopped to get a bacon...</i>

506
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:55,515
<i>...at a bodega, already
a quintessentially New York...</i>

507
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:56,718
Go away!

508
00:31:56,851 --> 00:31:59,219
Sorry to bother you,
Mr. Riley!

509
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:01,656
We just want to ask you
a few questions.

510
00:32:02,355 --> 00:32:04,391
I don't give interviews.

511
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:05,927
We're not looking
for an interview.

512
00:32:07,795 --> 00:32:09,764
Give me one good reason
why I should talk to you.

513
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:12,299
I'm Billy Loomis's daughter.

514
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:16,369
That's a terrible reason
for me to talk to you.

515
00:32:17,071 --> 00:32:18,673
My name is Samantha Carpenter.

516
00:32:18,806 --> 00:32:20,808
I was attacked last night
at the hospital.

517
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:24,244
The night before that,
my sister was stabbed seven times.

518
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:25,947
I know you know
what that's like.

519
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,050
I'm just trying
to protect my family.

520
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:32,954
Five minutes.
That's all I'm asking.

521
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,624
I'll give you
two minutes.

522
00:32:36,758 --> 00:32:38,291
I'm missing a show I like.

523
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:40,393
<i>...bangs again,
stage an intervention.</i>

524
00:32:40,527 --> 00:32:41,996
Gale Weathers.

525
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:45,265
- Weren't you two, um...
- Yeah.

526
00:32:54,142 --> 00:32:55,176
Who's he?

527
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:57,377
Oh, this is Richie,
my boyfriend.

528
00:32:57,511 --> 00:32:59,247
How long have
you known him?

529
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:00,547
Six months?

530
00:33:00,681 --> 00:33:02,917
Did he know who your dad was
when you met?

531
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,318
Express any interest
in Woodsboro

532
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,420
or the Ghostface killings?

533
00:33:07,554 --> 00:33:09,090
What the hell
are you talking about?

534
00:33:09,223 --> 00:33:11,993
Your killer's obsessed
with the <i>Stab</i> movies, right?

535
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:16,831
Well, there are certain rules
to surviving a <i>Stab</i> movie.

536
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:19,432
Believe me, I know.

537
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,170
Rule number one:

538
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:24,038
Never trust
the love interest.

539
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:27,507
They seem sweet, caring, supportive.
Then welcome to act 3,

540
00:33:27,642 --> 00:33:28,943
where they're trying
to rip your head off.

541
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:31,746
I was with Sam in Modesto
when Tara was attacked.

542
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,915
And let me guess,
you were just in the other room,

543
00:33:34,048 --> 00:33:37,185
conveniently unaccounted for when
she was attacked at the hospital.

544
00:33:37,317 --> 00:33:40,655
Okay, do I have to take this from
shitty Sam Elliott over here, or what?

545
00:33:40,788 --> 00:33:43,157
Rule number two...

546
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:47,695
...the killer's motive is always
connected to something in the past.

547
00:33:48,763 --> 00:33:50,430
- I'm related to Billy.
- Right,

548
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:53,333
but then why kill
that random Vince guy?

549
00:33:53,466 --> 00:33:54,969
That's for you
to figure out.

550
00:33:55,102 --> 00:33:58,306
And rule number three,
and this is the most important rule:

551
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:03,110
The first victim always has a friend
group that the killer is a part of.

552
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:06,280
Does your sister have a
close-knit group of friends?

553
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:07,882
Yeah.

554
00:34:09,283 --> 00:34:10,517
She does.

555
00:34:10,651 --> 00:34:12,352
Then look for the killer there.

556
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,189
If you can find out
why they're doing this,

557
00:34:15,323 --> 00:34:16,891
you can figure out
who's next.

558
00:34:17,925 --> 00:34:19,093
So help us.

559
00:34:19,927 --> 00:34:21,896
Help us figure out
who is behind this.

560
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:24,799
You kidding me?
I've been stabbed nine times.

561
00:34:24,932 --> 00:34:27,400
I've got permanent nerve damage
and a fun little limp.

562
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:29,469
You think I want
to do that again?

563
00:34:29,604 --> 00:34:33,440
You just said it always goes
back to the past, right?

564
00:34:34,709 --> 00:34:37,477
So if I'm in danger...

565
00:34:38,246 --> 00:34:39,981
that means you're in danger.

566
00:34:41,148 --> 00:34:42,515
Come on.

567
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:45,052
Let's do this together.

568
00:34:48,189 --> 00:34:49,156
Your time's up.

569
00:34:49,290 --> 00:34:50,691
Jesus!

570
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,996
Yeah, he's way more fun
in the movies.

571
00:34:57,832 --> 00:34:59,499
Okay, uh,
what's next?

572
00:34:59,634 --> 00:35:01,035
The friends.

573
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,404
<i>Thanks so much for that, Kevin.</i>

574
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:05,873
<i>Coming up after
our local weather,</i>

575
00:35:06,007 --> 00:35:08,910
<i>the pros and cons of
reuniting with old friends.</i>

576
00:35:37,338 --> 00:35:38,505
Hello?

577
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:40,440
<i>Hey, Sid, it's me.</i>

578
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:42,944
Dewey?

579
00:35:43,077 --> 00:35:45,478
Oh, my God.
How long has it been?

580
00:35:45,613 --> 00:35:48,349
I'm just trying to get a run in
before I take the girls to school.

581
00:35:48,481 --> 00:35:49,417
How are you?

582
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:51,419
I'm good,
really good.

583
00:35:51,551 --> 00:35:53,120
How are you?
How's Mark?

584
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:54,722
I think I'll keep him.

585
00:35:54,855 --> 00:35:56,657
How are things
in the sheriff's business?

586
00:35:56,791 --> 00:35:58,392
Uh, they're...

587
00:35:58,525 --> 00:36:02,196
- They're fine. But, Sid...
- <i>Have you talked to Gale lately?</i>

588
00:36:03,798 --> 00:36:05,598
No. Not in a couple years.

589
00:36:05,733 --> 00:36:08,769
I know things didn't end well
with you guys, but...

590
00:36:08,903 --> 00:36:09,971
Sid...

591
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:11,872
it's happening again.

592
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:17,345
What are you talking about?

593
00:36:17,477 --> 00:36:19,947
<i>Some idiot in a Ghostface mask.</i>

594
00:36:20,081 --> 00:36:22,750
<i>Three attacks so far.
One dead.</i>

595
00:36:22,883 --> 00:36:25,786
Something about this one
just feels different.

596
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:29,156
Are you okay?

597
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,459
<i>I'm fine,
you know me.</i>

598
00:36:31,591 --> 00:36:33,361
Yeah.

599
00:36:33,493 --> 00:36:35,029
I do. That's why I'm asking.

600
00:36:35,629 --> 00:36:37,298
I'm fine.

601
00:36:37,431 --> 00:36:38,699
I just...

602
00:36:38,833 --> 00:36:40,901
want you to be safe up there.
Do you have a gun?

603
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:44,472
I'm Sidney fucking Prescott.
Of course I have a gun.

604
00:36:46,707 --> 00:36:48,075
Good. That's good.

605
00:36:48,209 --> 00:36:50,144
Does Gale know?

606
00:36:50,277 --> 00:36:52,079
No, she's my next call.

607
00:36:52,646 --> 00:36:53,981
But, Sid, promise me:

608
00:36:54,115 --> 00:36:57,151
<i>No matter what you hear
or what you see on the news,</i>

609
00:36:57,284 --> 00:36:58,486
<i>don't come here.</i>

610
00:36:58,619 --> 00:36:59,854
No offense, Dewey.
I have no intention

611
00:36:59,987 --> 00:37:01,889
of ever setting foot
in that town again.

612
00:37:02,423 --> 00:37:03,657
Good.

613
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,460
Dewey...

614
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:09,830
<i>whoever this killer's after,
I'm glad they have you to protect them.</i>

615
00:37:11,165 --> 00:37:12,565
But...

616
00:37:13,501 --> 00:37:15,136
you be safe, okay?

617
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:17,671
Will do.

618
00:37:17,805 --> 00:37:19,807
<i>It's good to hear your voice.</i>

619
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:21,675
You too, Sid.

620
00:37:24,544 --> 00:37:27,448
Come on.
Get it together, Dewey.

621
00:37:49,403 --> 00:37:52,306
Probably shouldn't
have sent the smiley face.

622
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,383
Holy shit. He came.

623
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:43,290
I've decided to temporarily
assist you in your investigation.

624
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:44,892
Thank you.

625
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:48,662
Look, just because
that guy showered

626
00:38:48,796 --> 00:38:50,731
doesn't mean
he should have a gun.

627
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:53,634
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

628
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:59,507
How do you know
so much about the <i>Stab</i> movies?

629
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,242
Runs in her family.

630
00:39:01,842 --> 00:39:03,077
Randy was our uncle.

631
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:05,045
RIP.

632
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:08,749
You said to bring everybody.

633
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:10,217
Hey.

634
00:39:11,552 --> 00:39:14,188
Ooh, suspects!

635
00:39:15,122 --> 00:39:17,358
My brother
would be so proud.

636
00:39:17,825 --> 00:39:19,059
Hey, Martha.

637
00:39:20,161 --> 00:39:22,396
Dewey! Hi!

638
00:39:22,530 --> 00:39:24,031
You look...

639
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,168
Yeah.

640
00:39:27,768 --> 00:39:28,736
How's the wife?

641
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:30,538
Mom, we're good.
Thank you.

642
00:39:30,671 --> 00:39:33,807
All right, kids,
have fun.

643
00:39:36,377 --> 00:39:39,079
I asked Mindy to call everybody
here, because...

644
00:39:41,248 --> 00:39:43,317
there's something
I have to tell you.

645
00:39:44,653 --> 00:39:46,187
Let me get this straight.

646
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,556
You're saying that you're
the daughter of Billy Loomis,

647
00:39:48,722 --> 00:39:50,791
and, what,
that one of us is the killer?

648
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:53,561
The killer told me
he knew my secret.

649
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:56,096
He attacked Tara
to lure me back here.

650
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:58,599
But then why
immediately go and murder

651
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,768
some douche-nozzle
that was stalking Liv?

652
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,403
And why
does it have to be one of us?

653
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:05,839
What about Deputy Dewey here?
Maybe he's the killer.

654
00:40:06,307 --> 00:40:07,208
No offense.

655
00:40:07,341 --> 00:40:09,543
None taken,
but what's my motive?

656
00:40:09,678 --> 00:40:11,478
You got stabbed a billion times,

657
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:14,548
got dumped by your famous wife
and crawled into a bottle.

658
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,884
I think it's safe to say
you're on the suspect list.

659
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,019
Well, maybe you're the killer.

660
00:40:19,954 --> 00:40:21,355
Because that cut deep.

661
00:40:21,488 --> 00:40:24,258
That douche-nozzle
is connected.

662
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:27,161
I googled him.
His mom is Leslie Macher.

663
00:40:27,995 --> 00:40:30,064
- Stu Macher's sister.
- Who's Stu Macher?

664
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:32,466
He's Billy Loomis's accomplice.

665
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:34,268
A real loony tune.

666
00:40:34,401 --> 00:40:36,036
Okay. Okay.

667
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:40,642
So the first three attacks are all on
people related to the original killers.

668
00:40:40,774 --> 00:40:43,344
Oh, my God.
He's making a requel!

669
00:40:43,477 --> 00:40:44,345
A what?

670
00:40:44,478 --> 00:40:45,512
Or a legacyquel.

671
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:46,681
Fans are torn
on the terminology.

672
00:40:46,814 --> 00:40:47,815
Please speak English.

673
00:40:47,948 --> 00:40:49,016
Remember the <i>Stab</i> movie

674
00:40:49,149 --> 00:40:50,284
that came out last year?

675
00:40:50,417 --> 00:40:51,418
Oh, yeah!

676
00:40:51,552 --> 00:40:52,920
The one the <i>Knives Out</i> guy
directed?

677
00:40:53,053 --> 00:40:54,656
I actually really liked
that one.

678
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:56,423
Of course you did.
You have terrible taste.

679
00:40:56,557 --> 00:40:57,858
I hate you.

680
00:40:57,992 --> 00:41:00,662
The point is, the hard-core
<i>Stab</i> fans hated it.

681
00:41:00,794 --> 00:41:02,029
You go on 4chan
and Dreadit,

682
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:03,665
all they're talking about
is how <i>Stab 8</i>

683
00:41:03,797 --> 00:41:05,199
pissed on their childhoods.

684
00:41:05,332 --> 00:41:07,334
How they crammed in social
commentary just to elevate it.

685
00:41:07,468 --> 00:41:09,136
How the main character's
a Mary Sue.

686
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:10,804
- What's a Mary Sue?
- You really don't want to know.

687
00:41:10,938 --> 00:41:12,940
What's wrong
with elevated horror?

688
00:41:13,073 --> 00:41:14,975
I mean,
Jordan Peele fucking rules.

689
00:41:15,109 --> 00:41:17,278
Uh, obviously,
but that's not <i>Stab.</i>

690
00:41:17,411 --> 00:41:22,082
Real <i>Stab</i> movies are meta
slasher whodunits, full stop.

691
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:24,551
- Come on. It's just a movie.
- No, it's not.

692
00:41:24,686 --> 00:41:27,955
To some people, the original is
their favorite thing in the world.

693
00:41:28,088 --> 00:41:30,424
The movie that made them
love horror.

694
00:41:30,557 --> 00:41:33,762
That Mom or Dad showed them when they
were ten that bonded them together.

695
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:37,364
And God help anyone who slightly
fucks with that special memory.

696
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:39,533
Who makes a movie
they think disrespects it.

697
00:41:39,668 --> 00:41:43,937
It sounds like our killer is
writing his own version of <i>Stab 8,</i>

698
00:41:44,071 --> 00:41:46,573
but doing it as a requel.

699
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:47,742
Which is?

700
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:51,545
See, you can't just reboot a
franchise from scratch anymore.

701
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,980
The fans won't stand for it.

702
00:41:53,113 --> 00:41:55,617
<i>Black Christmas, Child's Play,
Flatliners...</i>

703
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,084
That shit doesn't work.

704
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:59,621
But you can't just do
a straight sequel, either.

705
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:01,188
You got to build something new.

706
00:42:01,322 --> 00:42:04,024
But not too new,
or the Internet goes bug-fucking nuts.

707
00:42:04,158 --> 00:42:06,026
It got to be part
of an ongoing story line,

708
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,530
even if the story shouldn't have
been ongoing in the first place.

709
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,098
New main characters, yes,

710
00:42:11,231 --> 00:42:14,835
but supported by and related to
legacy characters.

711
00:42:14,968 --> 00:42:16,970
Not quite a reboot,
not quite a sequel.

712
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:18,572
Like the new <i>Halloween, Saw,</i>

713
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:20,841
<i>Terminator, Jurassic
Park, Ghostbusters...</i>

714
00:42:20,974 --> 00:42:22,176
fuck, even <i>Star Wars!</i>

715
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:25,979
It always, always goes back
to the original!

716
00:42:26,113 --> 00:42:30,984
Are you telling me that I'm caught
in the middle of fan-fucking-fiction?

717
00:42:31,585 --> 00:42:34,488
Not just in the middle, Sam.

718
00:42:34,922 --> 00:42:36,590
You're the star.

719
00:42:38,859 --> 00:42:41,763
So, not to put
too fine a point on it,

720
00:42:41,895 --> 00:42:45,432
but, according
to requel rules...

721
00:42:46,266 --> 00:42:48,369
...who's next?

722
00:42:48,936 --> 00:42:50,504
Going by the pattern,

723
00:42:50,638 --> 00:42:54,274
whoever it is has to be connected
to someone that came before.

724
00:42:58,345 --> 00:43:00,514
I'm starting
to regret coming here.

725
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,282
Jesus, my mom was
a character in one of them.

726
00:43:02,416 --> 00:43:04,918
No one cares about the shitty
inferior sequels, Wes.

727
00:43:05,052 --> 00:43:06,019
You're safe.

728
00:43:06,153 --> 00:43:07,554
With Randy as our uncle, though,

729
00:43:07,689 --> 00:43:08,790
you and I are probably screwed.

730
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:10,524
- Wait. What?
- Or you're the killer,

731
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:14,361
and this whole elaborate monologue
is just to cover your tracks.

732
00:43:14,495 --> 00:43:18,232
I think it's pretty clear
who the killer is at this point.

733
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:19,400
Who?

734
00:43:20,334 --> 00:43:21,502
You.

735
00:43:21,636 --> 00:43:22,704
What...

736
00:43:22,837 --> 00:43:24,706
It makes perfect
requel sense.

737
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,074
- That actually does make sense.
- Yeah.

738
00:43:31,813 --> 00:43:33,180
Fuck this.

739
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,950
- Meet you back at the motel.
- Sam, wait.

740
00:43:37,084 --> 00:43:38,352
Sam, wait.

741
00:43:39,821 --> 00:43:43,157
The first fucking rule of
these movies is don't split up!

742
00:43:48,162 --> 00:43:49,930
The nerve of that girl,
right?

743
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:54,101
Really not
in the mood right now.

744
00:43:54,234 --> 00:43:55,269
Sam, Sam, Sam.

745
00:43:55,402 --> 00:43:57,471
There is a killer
on the loose.

746
00:43:57,605 --> 00:43:59,573
He's threatening you.
He's threatening your sister.

747
00:43:59,707 --> 00:44:02,476
Are you gonna run away from
who you are like you always do,

748
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:03,944
or are you gonna use it?

749
00:44:04,077 --> 00:44:05,446
I'm not like you.

750
00:44:05,579 --> 00:44:06,447
Really?

751
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:08,683
Then how else
are you gonna survive?

752
00:44:08,817 --> 00:44:12,620
I say accept who you are, let's get
out there, find out who's doing this,

753
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:14,689
and cut some
fucking throats!

754
00:44:14,823 --> 00:44:16,089
No!

755
00:44:22,262 --> 00:44:26,333
Mmm. And extra edamame.
Please.

756
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:30,037
Thank you.
I'll be there in ten minutes.

757
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:32,406
Bye.

758
00:44:39,848 --> 00:44:41,315
That you, tiger?

759
00:45:18,887 --> 00:45:21,188
Jesus!

760
00:45:24,391 --> 00:45:25,827
Are you being safe out there,
honey?

761
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,329
To the point that
all my friends mock me, yes.

762
00:45:29,463 --> 00:45:30,297
Good boy.

763
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:31,933
What's for dinner?

764
00:45:32,065 --> 00:45:34,134
Sushi. I was just leaving
to pick it up.

765
00:45:34,268 --> 00:45:36,436
Oh. Why don't you
just Postmates it?

766
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:38,973
Oh, it gets all smooshy
by the time it's here.

767
00:45:39,106 --> 00:45:41,009
I know you hate that.

768
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:42,977
- Go shower. I'll be back soon.
- Okay.

769
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,579
- Can you put this away for me?
- Yes.

770
00:45:46,848 --> 00:45:48,348
Okay.

771
00:45:49,017 --> 00:45:50,150
- Love you.
- Love you.

772
00:45:50,284 --> 00:45:52,252
- Lock the door.
- I will.

773
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:30,992
Sheriff Hicks.

774
00:46:31,124 --> 00:46:33,761
<i>Hello, Sheriff Judy.</i>

775
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:36,631
- Who is this?
- <i>I think you know.</i>

776
00:46:36,764 --> 00:46:40,534
<i>I'm a fan of scary movies.
And knives.</i>

777
00:46:40,668 --> 00:46:43,938
<i>What's your favorite
scary movie?</i>

778
00:46:44,072 --> 00:46:46,373
I prefer animated films
and musicals.

779
00:46:46,506 --> 00:46:48,408
Why are you doing this?

780
00:46:48,542 --> 00:46:52,847
<i>I'll tell you all about it.
I'm calling to turn myself in.</i>

781
00:46:52,981 --> 00:46:54,348
I think that's a great idea.

782
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:55,950
<i>We'll sit down at the station,</i>

783
00:46:56,084 --> 00:46:59,020
<i>and I'll tell you about
the two people I've killed.</i>

784
00:46:59,152 --> 00:47:00,487
You've only killed one person.

785
00:47:00,622 --> 00:47:03,156
<i>By the time I see you,</i>

786
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,893
<i>I'll have gutted your baby boy.</i>

787
00:47:06,027 --> 00:47:07,829
No.

788
00:47:07,962 --> 00:47:09,296
Whoa.

789
00:47:11,032 --> 00:47:12,599
Fuck you!

790
00:47:16,871 --> 00:47:18,039
Pick up, Wes!

791
00:47:29,549 --> 00:47:30,718
This is Sheriff Hicks.

792
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:32,586
I need units to converge
on my house ASAP.

793
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:35,089
<i>Copy that. We're on it.</i>

794
00:47:36,124 --> 00:47:38,225
<i>Can't get him
on the phone, can you?</i>

795
00:47:38,358 --> 00:47:39,794
<i>He must be busy.</i>

796
00:47:39,927 --> 00:47:42,130
How do I know
you're anywhere near him?

797
00:47:42,262 --> 00:47:45,165
<i>Ever seen the movie</i> Psycho?

798
00:47:56,811 --> 00:47:57,879
Please...

799
00:47:59,047 --> 00:48:00,247
don't hurt my boy.

800
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,515
<i>Why not?</i>

801
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:04,786
- He's a good kid.
- <i>Is he, now?</i>

802
00:48:04,919 --> 00:48:06,386
He never hurt anyone.

803
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,355
<i>That's not enough.</i>

804
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:10,658
Please! I'll do anything!

805
00:48:10,792 --> 00:48:14,962
<i>You're not gonna
make it in time, Sheriff Judy.</i>

806
00:48:32,947 --> 00:48:33,948
Wes!

807
00:48:34,414 --> 00:48:35,850
I'm coming!

808
00:48:36,617 --> 00:48:37,819
Wes!

809
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:46,928
Help!

810
00:48:49,197 --> 00:48:50,732
Help!

811
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:22,522
Okay.

812
00:51:22,083 --> 00:51:23,450
Mom?

813
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:48,175
Mom?

814
00:52:33,486 --> 00:52:36,090
Fuck... you!

815
00:53:22,236 --> 00:53:24,605
Miss, you can't be here.
You can't be here.

816
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:26,073
No, I'm sorry.
I know her son.

817
00:53:26,207 --> 00:53:29,542
- Her son, Wes. Is he...
- I'm sorry.

818
00:53:36,516 --> 00:53:38,019
I'm sorry.

819
00:53:49,463 --> 00:53:50,965
Excuse me.

820
00:53:53,601 --> 00:53:54,835
Oh, my God.

821
00:53:55,403 --> 00:53:56,504
You're...

822
00:53:56,937 --> 00:53:59,006
Well, you're you.

823
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:00,573
Last time I checked.

824
00:54:01,642 --> 00:54:04,645
Are you okay? You seem like
you're having a bit of a moment.

825
00:54:04,779 --> 00:54:06,013
Did you know the sheriff?

826
00:54:07,081 --> 00:54:08,249
Sort of.

827
00:54:09,016 --> 00:54:10,851
She didn't like me very much.

828
00:54:11,519 --> 00:54:12,653
She didn't like me either.

829
00:54:12,787 --> 00:54:16,589
Um... I'm Samantha.
Sam. Carpenter.

830
00:54:16,724 --> 00:54:18,225
My sister and I were attacked.

831
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:21,395
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

832
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,164
I'm Gale...

833
00:54:27,935 --> 00:54:28,969
Riley.

834
00:54:29,103 --> 00:54:31,939
Weathers. I'm Gale Weathers.
Excuse me.

835
00:54:34,708 --> 00:54:35,643
Gale?

836
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:36,911
- A text?
- Ow.

837
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,646
You tell me the killer is back
in a text?

838
00:54:38,779 --> 00:54:40,681
- Ow, that hurts.
- Good!

839
00:54:40,815 --> 00:54:43,583
- You were on the air.
- How do you know?

840
00:54:44,552 --> 00:54:45,986
A hunch.

841
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:48,722
You look good.
Are you still writing?

842
00:54:50,024 --> 00:54:51,158
No time.

843
00:54:51,292 --> 00:54:53,227
You were always happiest
when you were writing.

844
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,429
Well, sir, it's okay.
We're here with Gale.

845
00:54:55,563 --> 00:54:58,598
I'd give you a hand,
but I can't release anybody right now.

846
00:54:58,732 --> 00:55:00,468
Couldn't resist a good story,
could you?

847
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:01,802
Don't be an idiot, Dewey.

848
00:55:01,936 --> 00:55:03,737
I'm here
because I was worried about you.

849
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:05,339
Okay, yes.

850
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:08,843
My producers wanted me to cover
this, for obvious reasons,

851
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:11,078
but 90% is because of you.

852
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:13,781
Well, I feel 90% better.

853
00:55:13,914 --> 00:55:15,549
Don't be so sensitive.

854
00:55:15,683 --> 00:55:17,518
Since when did you care
about my feelings?

855
00:55:17,651 --> 00:55:19,420
Especially not
in the last couple years.

856
00:55:19,553 --> 00:55:22,423
All right, listen. Let's not pretend
I'm the one who ended things.

857
00:55:22,556 --> 00:55:26,127
No one's pretending, Gale.
I remember what happened.

858
00:55:27,695 --> 00:55:29,830
Why aren't you in uniform?

859
00:55:30,831 --> 00:55:32,133
I retired.

860
00:55:32,266 --> 00:55:33,834
Since when?

861
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:36,370
Since they asked me to.

862
00:55:37,705 --> 00:55:38,672
Oh, Dewey.

863
00:55:38,806 --> 00:55:40,774
I don't need your pity, Gale.

864
00:55:41,742 --> 00:55:43,944
I made my choices.
So did you.

865
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:47,047
It was my turn.
It was a great opportunity.

866
00:55:47,181 --> 00:55:49,216
- You said you'd try.
- And I did.

867
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:50,284
For two whole months!

868
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:52,386
Listen, if you want to make me
feel worse

869
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:54,221
than I already do,
good luck.

870
00:55:54,355 --> 00:55:57,591
The mornings aren't so bad,
'cause I get to see you.

871
00:55:57,758 --> 00:56:00,261
Pretend I'm still back there
in New York.

872
00:56:01,428 --> 00:56:02,930
But then I remember...

873
00:56:04,532 --> 00:56:05,866
that I couldn't hack it.

874
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,068
I left
in the middle of the night...

875
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:10,204
like a coward.

876
00:56:10,938 --> 00:56:13,007
Why wouldn't you
tell me that then?

877
00:56:13,541 --> 00:56:15,242
It would have mattered.

878
00:56:16,744 --> 00:56:19,346
You are a lot of things,
Dewey...

879
00:56:20,814 --> 00:56:22,883
but you are not a coward.

880
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:24,552
You just...

881
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:26,854
You just were meant to be
in Woodsboro.

882
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:29,023
And you weren't?

883
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:33,794
Promise me you'll leave
as soon as you can.

884
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:35,796
You know I can't promise that.

885
00:56:40,501 --> 00:56:42,136
I'm sorry about Judy.

886
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:44,772
Yeah, me too.

887
00:56:46,373 --> 00:56:49,243
But she'll make a great chapter
in your next book.

888
00:56:51,512 --> 00:56:53,080
<i>And don't even get me started</i>

889
00:56:53,214 --> 00:56:55,249
<i>on Ghostface's
signature new weapon.</i>

890
00:56:55,382 --> 00:56:57,051
<i>That shit is lit.</i>

891
00:56:57,184 --> 00:56:59,688
<i>And can we talk about</i>
<i>the title?</i> Stab?

892
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:01,322
<i>What, just like the original?</i>

893
00:57:01,455 --> 00:57:03,625
<i>Just call it</i> Stab 8.
<i>It's fucking</i> Stab 8.

894
00:57:03,757 --> 00:57:05,759
<i>You're not fooling anyone.</i>

895
00:57:05,893 --> 00:57:06,994
<i>It's such bullsh...</i>

896
00:57:07,127 --> 00:57:08,663
<i>Where have you been? You okay?</i>

897
00:57:08,796 --> 00:57:09,797
Yeah, I'm fine.

898
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:10,931
<i>That Mindy girl wasn't kidding.</i>

899
00:57:11,065 --> 00:57:12,933
<i>Stab 8</i> is not like the others.

900
00:57:13,067 --> 00:57:15,102
I mean, no connection
to the other movies.

901
00:57:15,236 --> 00:57:17,238
- No legacy characters at all.
- <i>Richie.</i>

902
00:57:17,371 --> 00:57:19,807
If you ask me, this franchise goes
off the rails with number five.

903
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:24,245
Richie, listen to me.
He killed two more people.

904
00:57:24,378 --> 00:57:25,479
Wes and his mother.

905
00:57:25,614 --> 00:57:28,082
<i>He killed the sheriff?
You can do that?</i>

906
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:30,584
<i>I mean, are you okay?
Where are you?</i>

907
00:57:31,485 --> 00:57:34,623
- I'll call you right back.
- <i>No, Sam...</i>

908
00:57:34,755 --> 00:57:36,290
Who's at the hospital?

909
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,193
Who's watching my sister?

910
00:57:39,326 --> 00:57:41,362
I just heard about the sheriff.

911
00:57:42,763 --> 00:57:44,565
They needed me here!

912
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:47,334
- Where are you going?
- My sister's in trouble!

913
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:52,172
...where Judy Hicks
has just been brutally murdered.

914
00:57:57,679 --> 00:58:00,781
What are you waiting for?
Drive!

915
00:58:01,448 --> 00:58:03,183
Come on. Let's go!

916
00:58:03,317 --> 00:58:05,252
- <i>Are the doors locked?</i>
- <i>Yeah, we should check.</i>

917
00:58:05,386 --> 00:58:08,623
<i>Joey and Pacey, check the front door.
Jen and Cliff, get flashlights...</i>

918
00:58:11,892 --> 00:58:13,827
- <i>Where you going?</i>
- Hello?

919
00:58:13,961 --> 00:58:15,129
<i>You stay there.</i>

920
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:16,964
<i>No, I'm coming with you.</i>

921
00:58:17,097 --> 00:58:18,733
<i>Okay.</i>

922
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:20,267
<i>He's got you.</i>

923
00:58:20,401 --> 00:58:21,235
Hello?

924
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:22,704
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

925
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:24,171
<i>Please. Quit tripping out.</i>

926
00:58:24,305 --> 00:58:26,240
<i>This is just Dawson
up to his old tired tricks.</i>

927
00:58:26,373 --> 00:58:28,075
<i>There's no psychopath
in this house.</i>

928
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:30,277
<i>Yes, there is.
And you brought her.</i>

929
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:32,212
Fuck this.

930
00:58:42,956 --> 00:58:44,191
Fuck!

931
00:58:45,292 --> 00:58:46,327
Oh!

932
00:59:35,744 --> 00:59:37,144
Goddamn it!

933
00:59:37,277 --> 00:59:39,012
Should you really be making
a phone call right now?

934
00:59:39,146 --> 00:59:41,148
Please, please.

935
01:00:08,777 --> 01:00:12,881
Stop! You know we have to live
through this to help her, right?

936
01:00:13,013 --> 01:00:14,181
Just hold on.

937
01:01:00,461 --> 01:01:03,363
Holy shit.

938
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,778
Ow! Ow.

939
01:01:16,911 --> 01:01:19,246
- Goddamn it!
- Richie?

940
01:01:19,379 --> 01:01:20,748
What are you doing here?

941
01:01:21,749 --> 01:01:22,917
Sam called. She said that...

942
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:24,451
you were in trouble.

943
01:01:24,585 --> 01:01:26,987
- Did you hit me with the phone?
- Look out!

944
01:02:07,996 --> 01:02:09,329
Richie!

945
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:12,065
- <i>Are you at the hospital?</i>
- Hello, Samantha.

946
01:02:13,066 --> 01:02:16,136
Richie can't come
to the phone right now.

947
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,906
He's finding out what happens
to people

948
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:21,141
who stick their noses in business
that doesn't concern them.

949
01:02:21,275 --> 01:02:24,344
- <i>Please don't hurt him.</i>
- Tell you what. You can choose.

950
01:02:24,478 --> 01:02:26,213
I'll only kill one.

951
01:02:26,346 --> 01:02:28,482
<i>What? What? Tera!</i>

952
01:02:28,616 --> 01:02:30,652
Who do you want to hear die?

953
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:33,587
<i>No. Please! I'm begging you.
Please don't hurt them.</i>

954
01:02:33,721 --> 01:02:35,623
Really?
You can't save your own sister?

955
01:02:35,757 --> 01:02:38,125
All you have to do is say,
"Kill Richie."

956
01:02:38,258 --> 01:02:40,327
<i>No!</i>

957
01:02:41,128 --> 01:02:42,462
<i>Tara! Don't touch her!</i>

958
01:02:42,596 --> 01:02:44,298
<i>Please, please, please.
I'm begging you.</i>

959
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:46,034
Or say, "Kill Tara,"

960
01:02:46,166 --> 01:02:49,771
and I'll make sure to hit all
the organs I missed last time.

961
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:51,405
- <i>No!</i>
- Fuck you!

962
01:02:51,538 --> 01:02:54,107
<i>I'm begging you.
Please don't hurt her.</i>

963
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:57,210
Last chance to save one.
Choose!

964
01:02:57,344 --> 01:02:59,781
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

965
01:02:59,914 --> 01:03:01,481
You want to know why, Sam?

966
01:03:01,616 --> 01:03:03,517
Maybe it's because
you're a selfish bitch

967
01:03:03,651 --> 01:03:07,454
who can't even make a decision to
save the life of someone you love.

968
01:03:08,388 --> 01:03:12,060
Maybe you're too weak
for this franchise.

969
01:03:13,061 --> 01:03:14,461
<i>Maybe you're right.</i>

970
01:03:15,562 --> 01:03:17,932
<i>Or maybe I'm just
stalling for time, fuckhead.</i>

971
01:03:23,771 --> 01:03:24,839
I'll get Richie.

972
01:03:24,973 --> 01:03:26,239
Tara!

973
01:03:27,274 --> 01:03:28,610
Oh, my God!

974
01:03:31,244 --> 01:03:32,379
Come on.

975
01:03:32,512 --> 01:03:34,314
It's okay. I got you.

976
01:03:36,149 --> 01:03:37,819
It's gonna be all right.

977
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,888
Get the elevator!

978
01:04:03,878 --> 01:04:05,345
Not today.

979
01:04:19,894 --> 01:04:21,194
Richie.

980
01:04:29,971 --> 01:04:31,806
- Come on, hurry up.
- Oh!

981
01:04:34,042 --> 01:04:35,643
- The head.
- What?

982
01:04:35,777 --> 01:04:38,245
You have to shoot 'em in the
head, or they always come back.

983
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:40,615
Dewey!
Who gives a fuck?

984
01:04:41,481 --> 01:04:43,685
- I do.
- No! Dewey!

985
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:24,926
Yes, today.

986
01:05:46,546 --> 01:05:48,582
It's an honor.

987
01:06:32,827 --> 01:06:34,294
No!

988
01:06:34,427 --> 01:06:37,297
No! No!

989
01:07:17,171 --> 01:07:18,538
I'm sorry.

990
01:07:21,408 --> 01:07:23,410
I didn't know him well, but...

991
01:07:24,511 --> 01:07:25,746
he helped me.

992
01:07:27,547 --> 01:07:29,884
That's what he did.

993
01:07:30,017 --> 01:07:31,351
He helped people.

994
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:34,421
I should've stopped him.

995
01:07:35,756 --> 01:07:38,025
If you had,
my sister would be dead.

996
01:07:41,128 --> 01:07:43,931
Samantha, your sister's awake.

997
01:08:01,381 --> 01:08:02,717
Gale.

998
01:08:03,184 --> 01:08:04,384
Sidney.

999
01:08:07,288 --> 01:08:08,823
I came as soon as I heard.

1000
01:08:11,959 --> 01:08:13,828
I'm so sorry.

1001
01:08:23,838 --> 01:08:25,405
You shouldn't be here.

1002
01:08:25,538 --> 01:08:27,141
You shouldn't be here either.

1003
01:08:29,210 --> 01:08:32,246
- Mark and the kids are okay?
- Yeah, they're safe for now.

1004
01:08:32,847 --> 01:08:34,782
I'm here to make sure of that.

1005
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:37,517
Come here.

1006
01:08:51,232 --> 01:08:52,266
How you feeling?

1007
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,868
Every time I get attacked,

1008
01:08:54,001 --> 01:08:55,870
they give me better painkillers.

1009
01:08:56,503 --> 01:08:58,039
So there's that.

1010
01:09:00,708 --> 01:09:02,143
I'm sorry.

1011
01:09:02,276 --> 01:09:04,211
For what?
You saved my life.

1012
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:09,750
For not telling you
sooner.

1013
01:09:11,252 --> 01:09:12,853
For being the reason Dad left.

1014
01:09:12,987 --> 01:09:14,889
You're not the reason Dad left.

1015
01:09:15,022 --> 01:09:18,693
You didn't choose where you
came from. Or who you came from.

1016
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:20,560
I don't blame you for that.

1017
01:09:22,396 --> 01:09:24,265
I blame you for leaving me too.

1018
01:09:24,398 --> 01:09:26,934
That's never gonna happen again.

1019
01:09:28,602 --> 01:09:29,870
I know.

1020
01:09:31,672 --> 01:09:33,641
But why didn't you
come to me back then?

1021
01:09:33,774 --> 01:09:35,810
I could've helped.

1022
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:37,111
Because...

1023
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:40,982
I was scared.

1024
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,050
Of what?

1025
01:09:44,285 --> 01:09:47,989
I was scared that I would
turn out just like him.

1026
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:50,658
So I ran.

1027
01:09:51,759 --> 01:09:53,427
To protect you.

1028
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,162
From me.

1029
01:09:55,997 --> 01:09:57,031
Sam...

1030
01:09:58,265 --> 01:10:00,167
you could never be like him.

1031
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:09,377
- You're so high right now.
- I'm so high right now.

1032
01:10:09,509 --> 01:10:12,013
I'm not even gonna lie.

1033
01:10:16,283 --> 01:10:17,852
I love you.

1034
01:10:18,786 --> 01:10:20,054
I love you too.

1035
01:10:23,758 --> 01:10:25,092
So what do we do now?

1036
01:10:26,093 --> 01:10:29,230
What nobody ever does
in these situations.

1037
01:10:30,931 --> 01:10:33,566
We're gonna get the fuck
out of Woodsboro.

1038
01:10:40,307 --> 01:10:41,876
- That's her?
- Yeah.

1039
01:10:45,046 --> 01:10:46,080
Samantha?

1040
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:49,750
It's Sam.

1041
01:10:49,884 --> 01:10:51,786
- I'm...
- I know who you are.

1042
01:10:53,687 --> 01:10:55,156
I hope you're okay.

1043
01:10:56,057 --> 01:10:58,726
- Listen, I'm sorry...
- You're Billy's daughter.

1044
01:11:00,428 --> 01:11:02,263
We'll bring the car around.

1045
01:11:05,833 --> 01:11:07,935
Yeah. I'm his daughter.

1046
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:10,371
I'm sorry
if that's weird for you.

1047
01:11:10,504 --> 01:11:12,239
No, no, it's...

1048
01:11:13,641 --> 01:11:16,811
I've been through this.
A lot.

1049
01:11:17,545 --> 01:11:18,846
You want to talk?

1050
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,148
I appreciate it.

1051
01:11:22,249 --> 01:11:23,384
And I'm...

1052
01:11:23,984 --> 01:11:26,253
I'm really sorry about Dewey.

1053
01:11:26,387 --> 01:11:29,156
But I'm taking my sister away
from all this.

1054
01:11:32,193 --> 01:11:33,761
I tried running too.

1055
01:11:33,894 --> 01:11:35,663
It doesn't work,
it always follows.

1056
01:11:35,796 --> 01:11:37,597
All due respect,
that's your life, not mine.

1057
01:11:37,731 --> 01:11:40,401
- I'm not so sure about that.
- What do you want from me, lady?

1058
01:11:40,534 --> 01:11:42,803
Hey! Watch your tone,
new girl.

1059
01:11:42,937 --> 01:11:45,739
You know how they always say
it goes back to the original?

1060
01:11:45,873 --> 01:11:47,374
Here's the original.

1061
01:11:47,508 --> 01:11:48,843
I want your help.

1062
01:11:48,976 --> 01:11:50,377
Because you're wrong,
this is your life now.

1063
01:11:50,511 --> 01:11:53,080
Which means whoever this is
will keep coming for you.

1064
01:11:53,214 --> 01:11:55,416
- So?
- So I want you to help us kill him.

1065
01:11:55,549 --> 01:12:00,788
You want me to help you and the host
of a morning show commit murder?

1066
01:12:00,921 --> 01:12:01,956
- Correct.
- Yeah.

1067
01:12:02,089 --> 01:12:04,658
And I'm what
in this scenario?

1068
01:12:04,792 --> 01:12:07,194
The bait?
The helpless victim?

1069
01:12:07,328 --> 01:12:10,197
- If the shoe fits...
- You're not helpless, Sam.

1070
01:12:10,331 --> 01:12:12,333
He killed your friend,
he killed ours.

1071
01:12:12,466 --> 01:12:15,669
And I have kids, which means I won't
sleep until he's in the ground.

1072
01:12:17,037 --> 01:12:19,940
Look, I'm sorry about what
this has done to your lives.

1073
01:12:20,074 --> 01:12:23,477
But no matter what you
or the killer or anyone says,

1074
01:12:23,612 --> 01:12:25,312
this isn't my story.

1075
01:12:25,446 --> 01:12:26,580
All right!

1076
01:12:26,714 --> 01:12:28,415
Let's get the fuck out of town,
huh?

1077
01:12:29,416 --> 01:12:31,385
Sorry.
That's my boyfriend, Richie.

1078
01:12:31,519 --> 01:12:33,220
Nice to meet... We met.

1079
01:12:33,354 --> 01:12:35,890
Sam, please get in the car so we
never have to see these people again.

1080
01:12:36,023 --> 01:12:39,193
- Sam...
- No. We're leaving.

1081
01:12:39,326 --> 01:12:41,695
That's the only way
I can protect Tara.

1082
01:12:43,297 --> 01:12:44,331
Okay, good luck.

1083
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:49,203
You too.

1084
01:12:54,008 --> 01:12:55,409
Well,
that went fucking horribly.

1085
01:12:55,543 --> 01:12:58,078
Don't worry, I have a plan.
She seems really tough.

1086
01:12:58,212 --> 01:13:00,414
Honestly, Sid,
who gives a shit?

1087
01:13:00,548 --> 01:13:02,483
You said it yourself,
he's gonna go after her.

1088
01:13:02,617 --> 01:13:04,018
I put a tracker
on her car.

1089
01:13:04,151 --> 01:13:05,753
- You did what?
- It seemed like something

1090
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:07,721
Gale Weathers would do.

1091
01:13:07,855 --> 01:13:10,090
Take that as a compliment.

1092
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:14,428
I left a message for Mom.
I told her where we're going.

1093
01:13:18,399 --> 01:13:19,634
Fuck, where is it?

1094
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:20,968
Where's what?

1095
01:13:21,101 --> 01:13:23,470
My inhaler.
I usually keep an extra one.

1096
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:25,472
Should we go back?

1097
01:13:25,607 --> 01:13:26,907
Whoa. Okay.

1098
01:13:27,041 --> 01:13:28,976
I vote for not going back
to the murder hospital.

1099
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:31,312
- You want to stop at a pharmacy?
- I'd need a prescription.

1100
01:13:31,445 --> 01:13:33,714
But I left an extra one
at Amber's.

1101
01:13:33,847 --> 01:13:36,750
- Her house is on the way.
- No. No. No, no, no.

1102
01:13:36,884 --> 01:13:38,118
I'd be in and out.

1103
01:13:38,252 --> 01:13:39,787
Could you hold out
till Modesto?

1104
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:42,022
- I don't think so.
- Okay, what's the address?

1105
01:13:42,156 --> 01:13:43,824
123 No Fucking Way Lane.

1106
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,627
Richie, she needs it.

1107
01:13:45,759 --> 01:13:49,263
And I need to keep all the
blood inside my body. So do you.

1108
01:13:49,396 --> 01:13:50,331
Richie, please.

1109
01:13:51,465 --> 01:13:52,766
It's okay.

1110
01:13:54,301 --> 01:13:57,404
Okay, yeah. Fuck.
What's the goddamn address?

1111
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:19,526
Keep pouring, Wheeler.
Thank you.

1112
01:14:20,427 --> 01:14:21,428
Hey.

1113
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:22,631
To Wes!

1114
01:14:22,763 --> 01:14:24,431
To Wes!

1115
01:14:24,565 --> 01:14:25,866
Beautiful son of a bitch.

1116
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:27,334
We love you, buddy!

1117
01:14:27,468 --> 01:14:29,837
Shots, really?
This is supposed to be a memorial.

1118
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,438
Well, this is how I mourn

1119
01:14:31,572 --> 01:14:35,843
and distract myself from
the looming specter of Death.

1120
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:37,478
Hey, we're low on beer.

1121
01:14:37,612 --> 01:14:40,114
There's more in the basement.
I'll go get some.

1122
01:15:19,754 --> 01:15:22,624
What the fuck, Mindy?
Jesus!

1123
01:15:22,757 --> 01:15:24,558
That was a test.
And you failed.

1124
01:15:24,693 --> 01:15:27,127
Never go off on your own
with a masked killer around.

1125
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:29,163
You're the one that said
we needed more beer.

1126
01:15:29,296 --> 01:15:31,332
And you should have asked me
to come with you.

1127
01:15:33,300 --> 01:15:35,002
You know what else
you shouldn't do

1128
01:15:35,135 --> 01:15:36,705
when there's
a masked killer around?

1129
01:15:36,837 --> 01:15:38,339
What?

1130
01:15:38,472 --> 01:15:43,077
Follow someone into
a dark, creepy basement alone.

1131
01:15:44,612 --> 01:15:45,846
I mean...

1132
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:49,149
...how do you know
I'm not the killer?

1133
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:54,088
Because I am.

1134
01:15:57,792 --> 01:15:59,126
I'm not, actually.

1135
01:15:59,259 --> 01:16:03,765
But let that be a lesson.
Don't trust anyone.

1136
01:16:03,897 --> 01:16:07,401
Then how can I trust you when
you say you're not the killer?

1137
01:16:07,534 --> 01:16:08,636
Exactly.

1138
01:16:09,738 --> 01:16:10,772
You're learning.

1139
01:16:11,405 --> 01:16:13,006
Now let's go back
upstairs.

1140
01:16:20,414 --> 01:16:21,448
You first.

1141
01:16:22,817 --> 01:16:24,051
Very good.

1142
01:16:34,863 --> 01:16:38,198
I think... Think I'm ready.

1143
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:41,101
I mean, I think we should.

1144
01:16:41,235 --> 01:16:44,271
Like now.
You want to go upstairs?

1145
01:16:45,005 --> 01:16:46,373
Like... Like upstairs?

1146
01:16:46,507 --> 01:16:48,342
Uh-huh. Right now.

1147
01:16:49,778 --> 01:16:51,145
Um...

1148
01:16:52,946 --> 01:16:57,719
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I think I have to pass on that.

1149
01:16:58,185 --> 01:16:59,420
What?

1150
01:17:01,522 --> 01:17:02,724
Why?

1151
01:17:04,591 --> 01:17:10,297
You know, I'm not like entirely
sure that you're not the...

1152
01:17:11,398 --> 01:17:12,433
killer.

1153
01:17:12,566 --> 01:17:14,401
"Don't take this
the wrong way"?

1154
01:17:14,535 --> 01:17:18,807
No, no, look. I'm almost 100%
certain that you are not,

1155
01:17:18,939 --> 01:17:22,744
but the safest option
is to be down here

1156
01:17:22,877 --> 01:17:23,878
with all the people...

1157
01:17:24,011 --> 01:17:25,312
Fuck you.

1158
01:17:25,446 --> 01:17:26,815
...and the potential witnesses.

1159
01:17:26,947 --> 01:17:29,583
That is a completely valid
emotional response to have.

1160
01:17:30,417 --> 01:17:32,553
- That too.
- Fucking asshole.

1161
01:17:33,922 --> 01:17:35,155
Good job.

1162
01:17:36,825 --> 01:17:37,892
Fuck you, Mindy.

1163
01:17:38,992 --> 01:17:41,863
If I hadn't have written
that book about your mother,

1164
01:17:41,995 --> 01:17:44,064
- none of this would've happened.
- Gale.

1165
01:17:44,198 --> 01:17:47,201
- I started all of this.
- No, you didn't.

1166
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:50,437
Billy Loomis started this,
and we're gonna end it.

1167
01:17:51,104 --> 01:17:52,439
After tonight,
no more books,

1168
01:17:52,573 --> 01:17:56,009
no more movies,
no more fucking Ghostface.

1169
01:17:56,143 --> 01:17:59,079
- <i>Don't you know the rules?</i>
- <i>What rules?</i>

1170
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,719
<i>There are specific rules</i>

1171
01:18:04,853 --> 01:18:08,656
<i>that one must abide by to
successfully survive a horror movie.</i>

1172
01:18:08,790 --> 01:18:09,791
<i>For instance,</i>

1173
01:18:09,924 --> 01:18:11,325
<i>number one...</i>

1174
01:18:11,458 --> 01:18:14,094
Don't do it.
Don't go outside after her.

1175
01:18:14,228 --> 01:18:15,262
She's not texting me back.

1176
01:18:15,395 --> 01:18:16,664
Because she's probably dead.

1177
01:18:16,798 --> 01:18:17,966
Jesus, Mindy.

1178
01:18:18,098 --> 01:18:19,634
That's my girlfriend,
and I love her.

1179
01:18:19,767 --> 01:18:21,568
Was your girlfriend.

1180
01:18:21,703 --> 01:18:23,738
You're just gonna sit and watch a
movie about our uncle getting stabbed?

1181
01:18:23,872 --> 01:18:26,473
It calms me down, okay?
I'm also gonna smoke some weed

1182
01:18:26,608 --> 01:18:29,176
and possibly
hook up with Frances.

1183
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:31,646
Have fun.

1184
01:18:31,779 --> 01:18:34,448
Oh, my God, at least take
some sort of weapon.

1185
01:18:34,983 --> 01:18:36,250
Here you go.

1186
01:18:50,097 --> 01:18:51,431
All right.

1187
01:18:55,003 --> 01:18:57,805
What?

1188
01:19:05,212 --> 01:19:07,214
Ah.

1189
01:19:20,628 --> 01:19:21,796
Liv?

1190
01:19:27,401 --> 01:19:28,603
Liv?

1191
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,796
All right.
Okay, yeah, no.

1192
01:19:56,597 --> 01:19:57,598
Shit!

1193
01:20:07,775 --> 01:20:09,744
Fuck!

1194
01:20:33,433 --> 01:20:35,737
Please, please, please.

1195
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:10,138
Whoa! Stop! Wait!

1196
01:21:23,718 --> 01:21:26,486
Oh, perfect.
She's having a party.

1197
01:21:26,621 --> 01:21:28,623
Who has a party in the
middle of a killing spree?

1198
01:21:28,756 --> 01:21:31,025
- Look, I'm aborting the plan.
- No, we're already here.

1199
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:33,961
I'll go in quickly and get it.
I'll be back in five.

1200
01:21:34,095 --> 01:21:35,195
I'm coming too.

1201
01:21:35,328 --> 01:21:36,864
If you think I'm waiting
out here

1202
01:21:36,998 --> 01:21:39,433
just to get murdered,
you're out of your mind.

1203
01:21:49,711 --> 01:21:50,912
Tara!

1204
01:21:52,479 --> 01:21:54,082
What are you doing
out of the hospital?

1205
01:21:54,214 --> 01:21:55,650
Should you even be up
and around?

1206
01:21:55,783 --> 01:21:58,552
- I need my spare inhaler.
- Why? Where are you going?

1207
01:22:01,789 --> 01:22:05,392
It's fine. Don't tell me.
I get it. Just be safe, okay?

1208
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:08,261
I think it's in my room.

1209
01:22:09,362 --> 01:22:10,564
All right, everyone!

1210
01:22:10,698 --> 01:22:13,601
Thanks for coming,
but the party's over!

1211
01:22:14,434 --> 01:22:15,636
- Time to go!
- Why?

1212
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:18,106
But it's so early!

1213
01:22:18,238 --> 01:22:19,607
Let's go.

1214
01:22:21,575 --> 01:22:25,079
Hey, hey, hey! Hello!
Can we cut the music, please?

1215
01:22:26,379 --> 01:22:29,516
Uh, hi... Gen Z.
How are you? Um...

1216
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:33,386
Both Sam and Tara here have been
attacked by the killer twice.

1217
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:37,390
And now they're here, which makes
this place a huge murder target, so...

1218
01:22:37,524 --> 01:22:39,426
if I were you,
I would probably leave.

1219
01:22:40,928 --> 01:22:42,429
Okay, I tried to be nice.
Get the fuck out!

1220
01:22:42,562 --> 01:22:44,331
Please get the fuck out.

1221
01:22:44,464 --> 01:22:46,601
- Sincerely, get the fuck out.
- Buzzkill!

1222
01:22:46,734 --> 01:22:48,535
Thank you. Thank you all.

1223
01:22:48,669 --> 01:22:51,505
I'm saving your life. I promise.

1224
01:22:51,639 --> 01:22:55,275
Thanks, teens.

1225
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:57,044
Thank you so much.

1226
01:22:57,178 --> 01:22:59,647
Thank you for leaving the cup.

1227
01:22:59,781 --> 01:23:01,082
Thank you.

1228
01:23:01,215 --> 01:23:02,650
Saving your life.

1229
01:23:03,283 --> 01:23:04,786
I'm saving your life.

1230
01:23:06,220 --> 01:23:07,822
Saving your life, thank you.

1231
01:23:08,923 --> 01:23:10,625
<i>And number three:</i>

1232
01:23:10,758 --> 01:23:13,161
<i>Never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances,</i>

1233
01:23:13,293 --> 01:23:15,129
<i>say, "I'll be right back."</i>

1234
01:23:15,263 --> 01:23:16,964
<i>'Cause you won't be back.</i>

1235
01:23:17,098 --> 01:23:20,101
Hey,
somebody's goofy-ass dad's kicking us out.

1236
01:23:20,234 --> 01:23:21,636
Goddamn it.

1237
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:22,603
Thank you.

1238
01:23:22,737 --> 01:23:24,337
Thanks, guys,
have a good night.

1239
01:23:24,471 --> 01:23:25,773
- You have my number.
- Bye.

1240
01:23:25,907 --> 01:23:27,642
Bye.

1241
01:23:38,585 --> 01:23:40,121
Hi. Uh...

1242
01:23:40,254 --> 01:23:42,657
Is there any beer left?
There's none in the kitchen.

1243
01:23:42,790 --> 01:23:45,726
Yes, Richie,
there's beer in the basement.

1244
01:23:46,459 --> 01:23:48,562
Right behind you.
Basement.

1245
01:23:48,996 --> 01:23:49,864
Yeah.

1246
01:23:49,997 --> 01:23:51,933
Do you want to, uh,
come with me?

1247
01:23:52,066 --> 01:23:55,102
No. But you were right to ask.

1248
01:23:55,236 --> 01:23:57,337
Yeah. Um...

1249
01:23:58,806 --> 01:24:00,842
Okay, I'll be right back...
Aha!

1250
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:04,912
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Okay.

1251
01:24:06,013 --> 01:24:07,581
Well, he's dead.

1252
01:24:08,783 --> 01:24:10,885
The goddamn fucking Uber
canceled on me!

1253
01:24:11,018 --> 01:24:11,953
Great.

1254
01:24:12,086 --> 01:24:13,553
Now I can't have sex,

1255
01:24:13,688 --> 01:24:15,388
and I can't get a ride home.

1256
01:24:15,522 --> 01:24:18,125
Could this night
get any shittier?

1257
01:24:18,259 --> 01:24:20,228
Liv, where's my brother?

1258
01:24:20,360 --> 01:24:21,863
What? I don't know, Mindy.

1259
01:24:21,996 --> 01:24:24,665
Probably off accusing everyone
of being the killer!

1260
01:24:24,799 --> 01:24:27,602
He actually went looking
for you.

1261
01:24:28,903 --> 01:24:31,038
I didn't see him.
Okay?

1262
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:33,975
Why are you looking at me
like that?

1263
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:37,845
Just revising my suspect list.

1264
01:24:40,547 --> 01:24:41,816
Fuck this!

1265
01:24:48,623 --> 01:24:50,725
Are you afraid of me,
Mindy?

1266
01:24:52,660 --> 01:24:56,563
You think I did something
to your brother? Huh?

1267
01:24:56,697 --> 01:24:59,667
You think I'm gonna...
cut you up?

1268
01:25:00,668 --> 01:25:03,536
A little bit now...
yeah.

1269
01:25:03,671 --> 01:25:07,540
I thought you said I was
too boring to be the killer.

1270
01:25:07,675 --> 01:25:10,144
Maybe that's the twist.

1271
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:15,415
What do you think, huh?
You're the expert.

1272
01:25:16,651 --> 01:25:20,922
You know what eventually happens
to the expert?

1273
01:25:21,822 --> 01:25:22,957
What?

1274
01:25:29,297 --> 01:25:30,998
Enjoy your stupid movie.

1275
01:25:33,433 --> 01:25:36,370
Fucking psycho.

1276
01:25:36,503 --> 01:25:38,005
They stopped.

1277
01:25:38,139 --> 01:25:40,174
- Gas station?
- No. I...

1278
01:25:40,308 --> 01:25:42,575
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1279
01:25:45,478 --> 01:25:47,547
Oh, shit. How far are we?

1280
01:25:47,682 --> 01:25:49,317
Too far.

1281
01:25:49,449 --> 01:25:50,651
Damn it.

1282
01:25:50,785 --> 01:25:52,954
Tara, we're leaving!

1283
01:25:58,591 --> 01:25:59,794
Hello.

1284
01:25:59,927 --> 01:26:01,594
You need to get out
of that house right now.

1285
01:26:01,729 --> 01:26:02,730
How do you know where I am?

1286
01:26:02,863 --> 01:26:04,497
You're in Stu Macher's house,

1287
01:26:04,632 --> 01:26:05,866
<i>where your dad and Stu
killed everyone.</i>

1288
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:07,401
<i>Someone planned
to get you there.</i>

1289
01:26:07,534 --> 01:26:09,536
<i>You need to get the fuck out,
Sam!</i>

1290
01:26:17,477 --> 01:26:19,512
<i>No, Jamie. Watch out.</i>

1291
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:21,849
<i>Watch out, Jamie.</i>

1292
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:23,985
<i>You know he's around.</i>

1293
01:26:24,819 --> 01:26:26,020
- What?
- <i>There he is.</i>

1294
01:26:26,153 --> 01:26:30,124
Come on, man, turn around!
Turn around! Dude!

1295
01:26:30,257 --> 01:26:31,926
<i>I told you.</i>

1296
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:34,729
<i>I told you, he's around the corner.
Jamie.</i>

1297
01:26:34,862 --> 01:26:37,832
- <i>Look behind you.</i>
- No, Randy, look behind you.

1298
01:26:37,965 --> 01:26:39,834
Come on, man,
turn around!

1299
01:26:39,967 --> 01:26:43,304
Dude, what are you doing?
You can do it!

1300
01:26:43,437 --> 01:26:46,374
These are your rules!
Own that shit.

1301
01:26:46,506 --> 01:26:48,442
<i>Behind you! Turn around.</i>

1302
01:26:48,575 --> 01:26:50,711
Look behind...

1303
01:26:52,313 --> 01:26:53,614
Oh, shit!

1304
01:27:12,166 --> 01:27:14,702
- Mindy.
- That's a lot of blood, Sam.

1305
01:27:14,835 --> 01:27:16,837
No, Mindy, stay with me.

1306
01:27:16,971 --> 01:27:19,807
What did you do to her?

1307
01:27:19,940 --> 01:27:21,942
Nothing.
No, I didn't do anything.

1308
01:27:22,076 --> 01:27:24,378
- The killer, he...
- Mindy!

1309
01:27:24,812 --> 01:27:25,746
What the fuck?

1310
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:27,348
Richie, where the fuck were you?

1311
01:27:27,481 --> 01:27:28,816
I went into the basement
to get beer.

1312
01:27:28,949 --> 01:27:30,084
You went to the basement alone?

1313
01:27:30,217 --> 01:27:31,919
I asked her to come with me!
She said no!

1314
01:27:32,053 --> 01:27:33,521
Fuck!

1315
01:27:33,654 --> 01:27:35,022
Stay the fuck back.

1316
01:27:35,156 --> 01:27:36,290
Jesus Christ!

1317
01:27:36,424 --> 01:27:37,590
I was with Tara,

1318
01:27:37,725 --> 01:27:39,026
but the rest of you
were wandering around.

1319
01:27:39,160 --> 01:27:40,728
One of you
is the fucking killer!

1320
01:27:40,861 --> 01:27:43,297
Fuck you, Amber. Fuck you!

1321
01:27:43,431 --> 01:27:44,932
Why is there blood
on your hands?

1322
01:27:45,066 --> 01:27:46,133
What?

1323
01:27:48,235 --> 01:27:49,136
I found Chad.

1324
01:27:49,270 --> 01:27:51,372
- I found Chad and he's...
- Chad?

1325
01:27:51,505 --> 01:27:53,741
- You're fucking lying.
- No.

1326
01:27:53,874 --> 01:27:55,910
- You're the killer.
- No, I'm not.

1327
01:27:56,043 --> 01:27:56,977
Liv, stop.

1328
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:59,180
- Fuck you!
- Liv, just stop!

1329
01:27:59,313 --> 01:28:03,050
Fuck you, Amber.
I'm not the fucking killer!

1330
01:28:03,184 --> 01:28:04,285
I know.

1331
01:28:07,621 --> 01:28:08,956
Welcome to act three.

1332
01:28:09,090 --> 01:28:10,224
Run!

1333
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,527
Holy shit!

1334
01:28:13,661 --> 01:28:14,962
- Sam, come on!
- No...

1335
01:28:15,096 --> 01:28:17,865
Run! Go, go, go! Go!

1336
01:28:19,366 --> 01:28:20,701
Oh, my God.
Holy shit!

1337
01:28:20,835 --> 01:28:22,937
- Oh, my God... Tara!
- Wait, no, Sam.

1338
01:28:23,070 --> 01:28:24,004
- She has a gun.
- Richie.

1339
01:28:24,138 --> 01:28:26,674
There are always
two killers.

1340
01:28:35,015 --> 01:28:37,184
Sam, please put the knife down.

1341
01:28:39,253 --> 01:28:40,821
Look, I think...

1342
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:43,224
- The other killer might be Tara.
- What?

1343
01:28:43,357 --> 01:28:44,792
She's the one
that brought us here,

1344
01:28:44,925 --> 01:28:47,061
and you two have been
estranged for years.

1345
01:28:48,629 --> 01:28:49,930
I mean,

1346
01:28:50,664 --> 01:28:52,666
how well
do you really know her?

1347
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:54,301
Better than I know you.

1348
01:28:57,438 --> 01:28:59,273
Sam, wait, whoa. Sam!

1349
01:29:15,789 --> 01:29:17,291
Sounds about right.

1350
01:29:17,825 --> 01:29:18,792
You ready?

1351
01:29:18,926 --> 01:29:20,995
For this? Never.

1352
01:29:21,695 --> 01:29:23,030
Here we go.

1353
01:29:29,470 --> 01:29:32,641
Help me, help me! He stabbed me!

1354
01:29:32,773 --> 01:29:34,542
- What do you think?
- Trap.

1355
01:29:34,675 --> 01:29:36,177
Fuck it.

1356
01:29:36,310 --> 01:29:37,378
Ow!

1357
01:29:39,747 --> 01:29:41,315
Gale! Gale!

1358
01:29:41,448 --> 01:29:42,716
Wait. Let me see.

1359
01:29:42,850 --> 01:29:43,884
Let me see.

1360
01:29:44,018 --> 01:29:46,253
- You got to go to the hospital.
- No.

1361
01:29:46,387 --> 01:29:49,690
You said we were gonna finish
this. Go finish it, Sidney.

1362
01:29:50,324 --> 01:29:51,525
Gale.

1363
01:29:51,892 --> 01:29:53,127
For Dewey.

1364
01:30:33,901 --> 01:30:35,604
Anyone hiding,
killer or not,

1365
01:30:35,736 --> 01:30:38,239
you have five seconds
to show yourself!

1366
01:31:11,939 --> 01:31:13,240
Oh, Tara.

1367
01:31:13,374 --> 01:31:14,408
Oh, my God.

1368
01:31:22,684 --> 01:31:24,251
Sam.

1369
01:31:24,885 --> 01:31:26,253
Sam, please.

1370
01:31:36,096 --> 01:31:38,667
<i>Hello, Sidney!</i>

1371
01:31:38,799 --> 01:31:40,901
Hello there.
Where'd you go?

1372
01:31:41,035 --> 01:31:44,538
<i>Oh, this isn't Amber.
I'm the other one.</i>

1373
01:31:45,172 --> 01:31:48,575
Oh. There's two of you. Again.

1374
01:31:48,710 --> 01:31:50,277
I've seen this movie before.

1375
01:31:50,411 --> 01:31:52,179
<i>Not this movie, Sidney.</i>

1376
01:31:52,313 --> 01:31:54,515
You really need
some new material.

1377
01:31:55,549 --> 01:31:58,218
<i>I got you here, didn't I?</i>

1378
01:31:58,352 --> 01:32:00,689
You might actually be
the most derivative one of all.

1379
01:32:00,821 --> 01:32:02,222
I mean, Christ,
the same house?

1380
01:32:02,356 --> 01:32:04,626
<i>Maybe so.
But you forgot the first rule</i>

1381
01:32:04,759 --> 01:32:06,661
<i>of surviving a</i> Stab <i>movie.</i>

1382
01:32:06,795 --> 01:32:07,796
<i>Never answer the...</i>

1383
01:32:07,928 --> 01:32:09,563
- I'm bored.
- <i>Wait!</i>

1384
01:32:13,934 --> 01:32:15,502
Put your hands up!
Show me your hands!

1385
01:32:15,637 --> 01:32:17,037
What are you doing in there?

1386
01:32:17,171 --> 01:32:19,373
- Hiding from murderers.
- I told you to come out!

1387
01:32:19,506 --> 01:32:22,509
I'm not gonna come out!
You're shooting everything!

1388
01:32:23,177 --> 01:32:25,312
Holy shit,
it's Ghostface!

1389
01:32:41,161 --> 01:32:43,030
Richie! Gun. Get the gun.

1390
01:32:43,163 --> 01:32:45,566
Yeah, kind of hard
since you shot me in the leg.

1391
01:32:45,700 --> 01:32:47,968
Fuck. Fuck.

1392
01:32:56,110 --> 01:32:58,278
- Yes! Yes!
- Shoot him!

1393
01:33:01,048 --> 01:33:02,216
Thank God you're okay.

1394
01:33:06,186 --> 01:33:08,122
'Cause I really,

1395
01:33:08,255 --> 01:33:10,625
really wanted to be
the one to kill you.

1396
01:33:14,829 --> 01:33:16,563
Sit the fuck down, Prescott!

1397
01:33:38,452 --> 01:33:41,054
I can't believe this worked.

1398
01:33:45,492 --> 01:33:48,362
I know.
It's a bummer it's me.

1399
01:33:52,065 --> 01:33:56,136
But it really was
the best choice for the movie.

1400
01:33:57,204 --> 01:33:59,540
This isn't a fucking movie!

1401
01:34:00,642 --> 01:34:02,576
No. But it will be.

1402
01:34:03,778 --> 01:34:06,580
- That's the point, right, Amber?
- Right, hon!

1403
01:34:06,714 --> 01:34:10,517
Third act bloodbath, check.
Killers revealed, check.

1404
01:34:10,652 --> 01:34:12,486
Time for the big finale!

1405
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:17,558
- Richie...
- Shh, shh...

1406
01:34:18,992 --> 01:34:21,028
Okay. Okay.

1407
01:34:21,161 --> 01:34:22,596
Let's get 'em
into the kitchen.

1408
01:34:24,131 --> 01:34:25,332
Let's go, bitch!

1409
01:34:25,466 --> 01:34:27,568
Someone has to
save the franchise.

1410
01:34:27,702 --> 01:34:32,607
You see, no one has made a great
<i>Stab</i> movie since the first one.

1411
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:34,107
Not really.

1412
01:34:34,241 --> 01:34:35,476
Hey, baby, you want to go get

1413
01:34:35,610 --> 01:34:38,979
- the very ex-Mrs. Riley?
- Yeah, I do.

1414
01:34:40,080 --> 01:34:41,048
Hey, hey!

1415
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:43,718
Whoa... whoa.

1416
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:46,053
Sidney Prescott.

1417
01:34:46,186 --> 01:34:47,988
You know...

1418
01:34:49,223 --> 01:34:50,557
I'm a really big fan.

1419
01:34:50,692 --> 01:34:51,458
Go fuck yourself.

1420
01:34:51,592 --> 01:34:53,393
You see the last <i>Stab</i> movie?

1421
01:34:53,527 --> 01:34:55,262
Not really a fan
of scary movies.

1422
01:34:55,395 --> 01:34:57,632
That checks out.
Anyway, it sucked balls.

1423
01:34:57,765 --> 01:35:00,067
Because nobody takes
the true fans seriously.

1424
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:01,669
Not really.

1425
01:35:02,302 --> 01:35:04,806
They just laugh at us, and why?

1426
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:06,975
Because we love something?

1427
01:35:07,107 --> 01:35:09,009
We're just a fucking joke
to them?

1428
01:35:09,911 --> 01:35:13,547
How can fandom be toxic?

1429
01:35:13,681 --> 01:35:15,282
It's about love!

1430
01:35:15,415 --> 01:35:18,987
They don't fucking understand that
these movies are important to people.

1431
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,788
- Richie...
- We're gonna help them!

1432
01:35:21,623 --> 01:35:23,925
Hollywood's
totally fucking out of ideas,

1433
01:35:24,057 --> 01:35:27,361
so we decided we'd give them some
new source material to follow.

1434
01:35:27,494 --> 01:35:29,329
You know,
bring it back to basics.

1435
01:35:29,463 --> 01:35:31,699
Because that's how you make
a great <i>Stab</i> movie, Sam.

1436
01:35:32,767 --> 01:35:34,769
"Based on actual events."

1437
01:35:37,005 --> 01:35:38,272
- Gale.
- Shh, shh.

1438
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:41,108
Back up. Back up.

1439
01:35:46,346 --> 01:35:48,850
You did all this
just to make me the hero

1440
01:35:48,983 --> 01:35:50,217
of your fucked-up movie?

1441
01:35:50,350 --> 01:35:53,487
Sweetie, you're not the hero.

1442
01:35:55,422 --> 01:35:57,190
You're the villain.

1443
01:35:57,859 --> 01:35:59,027
The daughter of Billy Loomis

1444
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:01,295
who sees fucked-up visions
of her dead dad?

1445
01:36:01,428 --> 01:36:03,463
Sidney Prescott
killed your father.

1446
01:36:03,597 --> 01:36:04,799
You...

1447
01:36:04,933 --> 01:36:08,736
did all this just to get her
back to Woodsboro.

1448
01:36:10,004 --> 01:36:11,438
You know what the biggest
problem

1449
01:36:11,572 --> 01:36:13,574
with the <i>Stab</i> movies is?

1450
01:36:13,708 --> 01:36:16,878
There's no Michael Myers
or Jason Voorhees.

1451
01:36:17,011 --> 01:36:19,714
No bad guy to keep coming back.

1452
01:36:19,847 --> 01:36:23,150
But the illegitimate daughter
of the original mastermind?

1453
01:36:23,283 --> 01:36:25,620
Now that's a fucking villain.

1454
01:36:25,753 --> 01:36:28,690
- How did you know?
- About your father?

1455
01:36:29,691 --> 01:36:33,093
It's a small town,
and your mom's a drunk!

1456
01:36:33,226 --> 01:36:36,163
I met Richie
on the <i>Stab</i> subreddit.

1457
01:36:36,296 --> 01:36:40,500
I've been obsessed ever since
my parents bought this house.

1458
01:36:40,635 --> 01:36:43,337
We realized pretty quickly
we had similar ideas.

1459
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:45,907
Wasn't that hard for me
to find you in Modesto.

1460
01:36:46,808 --> 01:36:49,109
It wasn't that hard for me
to fuck you, either.

1461
01:36:49,242 --> 01:36:50,612
But I guess
being a sexually available woman

1462
01:36:50,745 --> 01:36:52,647
is supposed to be empowering
these days.

1463
01:36:52,780 --> 01:36:53,848
Fuck you!

1464
01:36:53,982 --> 01:36:55,515
Well, now you're just
quoting the original.

1465
01:36:57,184 --> 01:36:59,586
But it wouldn't work
with just you, Sam.

1466
01:36:59,721 --> 01:37:03,457
See, we had to bring the legacy
characters back to make it matter.

1467
01:37:04,358 --> 01:37:07,127
Can't have a bona fide Halloween
without Jamie Lee!

1468
01:37:07,260 --> 01:37:08,261
Nope!

1469
01:37:08,395 --> 01:37:09,731
Dewey had to die
to make it real.

1470
01:37:09,864 --> 01:37:12,199
To show that this
wasn't just some bullshit,

1471
01:37:12,332 --> 01:37:16,004
cash-in, run-of-the-mill sequel.

1472
01:37:16,136 --> 01:37:19,707
Because our movie
has fucking stakes!

1473
01:37:20,608 --> 01:37:23,176
'Cause anyone can die
in a requel.

1474
01:37:23,310 --> 01:37:25,579
No!

1475
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:29,316
Goddamn it. Whoa, whoa!

1476
01:37:29,449 --> 01:37:31,786
No, hey! Sit the fuck down.

1477
01:37:35,222 --> 01:37:37,257
I'm so sorry, Sid.

1478
01:37:37,391 --> 01:37:39,226
We can't let you live either.

1479
01:37:39,359 --> 01:37:41,328
I mean,
surviving this many times...

1480
01:37:41,461 --> 01:37:43,665
that would just be ridiculous.

1481
01:37:43,798 --> 01:37:46,968
This time the fans are gonna be
the ones who win.

1482
01:37:49,637 --> 01:37:52,572
- That about cover it?
- Nailed it, baby.

1483
01:37:53,373 --> 01:37:54,709
Get Tara out of the closet.

1484
01:37:54,842 --> 01:37:57,477
We got to start staging
the bodies!

1485
01:37:57,612 --> 01:38:01,381
Stay with me, Sid.
Stay with me.

1486
01:38:01,515 --> 01:38:04,251
You really
should've listened to Dewey.

1487
01:38:04,384 --> 01:38:07,755
He nailed it in one!
Dude, look at the love interest!

1488
01:38:07,889 --> 01:38:08,956
Are you fucking stupid?

1489
01:38:09,090 --> 01:38:11,159
I even had you convinced
it could be your sister.

1490
01:38:13,493 --> 01:38:15,830
Um, she's not here.

1491
01:38:18,498 --> 01:38:20,835
What the fuck do you mean,
"She's not here"?

1492
01:38:20,968 --> 01:38:22,136
She's not here!

1493
01:38:22,269 --> 01:38:24,371
I untied her.

1494
01:38:25,405 --> 01:38:27,875
Guess you're not
as persuasive as you thought.

1495
01:38:34,015 --> 01:38:35,950
That's for you.

1496
01:38:36,084 --> 01:38:37,551
Yeah.

1497
01:38:37,685 --> 01:38:39,654
Like your gimpy little sister's
gonna make a difference.

1498
01:38:39,787 --> 01:38:41,455
She's our fucking pincushion
at this point.

1499
01:38:41,588 --> 01:38:44,625
Amber! Fan out.
She couldn't have gotten far.

1500
01:38:44,759 --> 01:38:46,493
I can't find her!

1501
01:38:52,934 --> 01:38:54,468
Amber?

1502
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:20,862
Sam! Where you going?
Your big scene's coming up!

1503
01:39:28,870 --> 01:39:30,303
Fucking kill you!

1504
01:39:32,740 --> 01:39:35,308
The fucking hand sanitizer?

1505
01:39:40,982 --> 01:39:43,618
No, no, no, it's not my fault!
It's not my fault!

1506
01:39:43,751 --> 01:39:45,552
Let me guess,
the movies made you do it?

1507
01:39:45,686 --> 01:39:48,256
No, it was the message boards!
I was radicalized.

1508
01:39:48,388 --> 01:39:50,524
- By movie fans?
- Yes, they're so mad!

1509
01:39:50,658 --> 01:39:52,292
Please, it's not my fault.
I'm just a dumb kid.

1510
01:39:52,425 --> 01:39:53,694
I wanted to be
a part of something.

1511
01:39:53,828 --> 01:39:57,098
"A part of something"?
You killed my best friend!

1512
01:39:57,231 --> 01:39:59,200
Yeah, and he died like a pussy.

1513
01:40:12,579 --> 01:40:14,982
That's the thing about slashers,
Sam.

1514
01:40:17,018 --> 01:40:18,820
So many blood trails.

1515
01:40:18,953 --> 01:40:20,554
This one yours?

1516
01:40:21,521 --> 01:40:23,456
Only one way to find out!

1517
01:40:29,730 --> 01:40:32,465
I was the last thing Dewey saw
before he died too.

1518
01:40:32,599 --> 01:40:34,836
I can't believe
I get to do you both.

1519
01:40:36,170 --> 01:40:39,640
No last-minute saves this time.
Your story's over!

1520
01:40:45,146 --> 01:40:46,981
Time to pass the torch.

1521
01:40:47,581 --> 01:40:49,349
It's all yours, bitch!

1522
01:40:53,020 --> 01:40:55,790
- You want to do the honors?
- This one's yours.

1523
01:41:00,628 --> 01:41:03,331
No, stop, stop, stop!
I'm sorry about Dewey.

1524
01:41:03,496 --> 01:41:04,832
Fuck you.

1525
01:41:19,013 --> 01:41:20,648
Enjoy that torch.

1526
01:41:36,764 --> 01:41:39,100
Stop...

1527
01:41:39,233 --> 01:41:40,400
fucking up...

1528
01:41:40,533 --> 01:41:42,569
my ending!

1529
01:41:48,042 --> 01:41:49,076
Sam?

1530
01:41:51,478 --> 01:41:52,813
Sam!

1531
01:42:01,656 --> 01:42:03,057
Okay.

1532
01:42:09,931 --> 01:42:11,766
What are you gonna do now, huh?

1533
01:42:11,899 --> 01:42:14,101
Make a scary phone call to me?

1534
01:42:14,235 --> 01:42:17,738
Pop out of that closet
in a Ghostface mask?

1535
01:42:18,339 --> 01:42:19,407
No.

1536
01:42:19,974 --> 01:42:21,976
Because you're the villain!

1537
01:42:22,910 --> 01:42:25,646
And the villain dies at the end.

1538
01:42:25,780 --> 01:42:27,715
Those are the rules.

1539
01:42:28,816 --> 01:42:30,550
I'm introducing
a new rule.

1540
01:42:31,819 --> 01:42:33,854
And what would that be? Huh?

1541
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:36,157
Well?

1542
01:42:38,893 --> 01:42:41,796
Never fuck with
the daughter of a serial killer.

1543
01:43:04,752 --> 01:43:06,519
Wait!

1544
01:43:09,690 --> 01:43:12,525
What about... my ending?

1545
01:43:17,665 --> 01:43:19,033
Here it comes.

1546
01:43:19,166 --> 01:43:20,735
No!

1547
01:43:56,370 --> 01:43:58,538
Careful,
they always come back.

1548
01:44:09,316 --> 01:44:10,851
Okay, then.

1549
01:44:18,926 --> 01:44:23,264
I still prefer <i>The Babadook.</i>

1550
01:44:35,309 --> 01:44:36,444
Are you okay?

1551
01:44:36,576 --> 01:44:38,145
- Are you good?
- Mm-hmm.

1552
01:44:48,422 --> 01:44:49,890
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me.

1553
01:44:52,126 --> 01:44:53,661
Excuse me, sir.

1554
01:44:55,595 --> 01:44:57,765
- Hey.
- Hey.

1555
01:44:57,898 --> 01:44:59,733
She's gonna be okay.

1556
01:45:11,479 --> 01:45:14,215
Can you take us to a
different hospital this time?

1557
01:45:14,348 --> 01:45:15,683
Of course.

1558
01:45:18,352 --> 01:45:19,854
You ready to go?

1559
01:45:24,758 --> 01:45:26,861
I'll be right back, yeah?

1560
01:45:33,267 --> 01:45:34,869
Your vitals look good.

1561
01:45:35,569 --> 01:45:37,471
Just sit tight
for a draft, okay?

1562
01:45:37,606 --> 01:45:39,874
Sidney. Gale.

1563
01:45:42,510 --> 01:45:43,978
Thank you both.

1564
01:45:44,678 --> 01:45:45,980
For everything.

1565
01:45:47,781 --> 01:45:49,183
Are you gonna be all right?

1566
01:45:50,017 --> 01:45:52,920
I'll survive.
I always do.

1567
01:45:53,487 --> 01:45:54,822
You were right...

1568
01:45:55,322 --> 01:45:56,957
about not running.

1569
01:45:57,525 --> 01:45:59,059
Sorry about that.

1570
01:46:00,861 --> 01:46:02,129
How are you doing?

1571
01:46:03,864 --> 01:46:05,399
Ask me in a few days.

1572
01:46:07,101 --> 01:46:09,403
But at least I know
what I'm gonna write about.

1573
01:46:09,537 --> 01:46:11,138
What's that?

1574
01:46:12,106 --> 01:46:13,207
Not this.

1575
01:46:13,340 --> 01:46:15,543
Those fuckers can die
in anonymity.

1576
01:46:16,343 --> 01:46:18,212
But maybe something
about a good man

1577
01:46:18,345 --> 01:46:20,381
who used to be
the sheriff here once.

1578
01:46:21,749 --> 01:46:23,450
I'd like to read that story.

1579
01:46:24,852 --> 01:46:26,954
Can I ask you a weird question?

1580
01:46:27,488 --> 01:46:29,023
Yeah.

1581
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:31,926
Am I gonna be okay?

1582
01:46:34,395 --> 01:46:35,896
Eventually.

1583
01:47:00,187 --> 01:47:02,389
- Hey.
- Wait. Sam, Sam, Sam!

1584
01:47:03,390 --> 01:47:04,858
Thank you.

1585
01:47:07,228 --> 01:47:09,797
Well, you're not going
anywhere without me.

1586
01:47:10,864 --> 01:47:12,166
Don't worry.

1587
01:47:12,299 --> 01:47:14,802
I'm gonna hold your hand
all the way there.

1588
01:47:18,172 --> 01:47:20,274
I can take care of her
and her sister.

1589
01:47:20,407 --> 01:47:22,509
She's all ready
for transportation.

1590
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:36,357
Twenty-five years ago,
almost to the day, in this very house

1591
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:38,058
a tragic story ended.

1592
01:47:38,192 --> 01:47:41,095
Tonight, a new chapter
came to a close.

1593
01:47:41,228 --> 01:47:43,364
Police do not have
a lot of information right now,

1594
01:47:43,497 --> 01:47:45,366
as they are still
collecting evidence.

1595
01:47:45,499 --> 01:47:48,402
As you can see, this is
a very active crime scene here.

1596
01:47:48,535 --> 01:47:51,238
An unknown number of fatalities,
several injuries,

1597
01:47:51,372 --> 01:47:54,842
some people being taken off by
ambulance right now as we speak.

1598
01:47:54,975 --> 01:47:56,777
This is a developing story...

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
