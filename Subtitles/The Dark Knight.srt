1
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:47,940
Three of a kind, let's do this.
That's it? Three guys?

2
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,443
Two guys on the roof.
Every guy gets a share. Five shares is plenty.

3
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:54,071
Six shares.
Don't forget the guy who planned the job.

4
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,532
He thinks he can sit it out
and still take a slice.

5
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,827
-I know why they call him the Joker.
Why do they call him the Joker?

6
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,829
I heard he wears makeup.
Makeup?

7
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,956
Yeah, to scare people.
You know, war paint.

8
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,721
All right, everybody,
hands up, heads down!

9
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:22,891
I said, hands up, heads down!

10
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,019
Let's go, pal,
I'm making a withdrawal here.

11
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,729
-I said, hands up!
-No!

12
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:30,357
Here comes the silent alarm.

13
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,859
And there it goes.

14
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,235
Heads down!

15
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:35,737
All right, tootsie,
you're taking a dive with me.

16
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,574
-Down! I said, stay down there!
Don't hurt me!

17
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,827
Funny, it didn't dial 911.
It was trying to reach a private number.

18
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,912
Is it a problem?
No, I'm done here.

19
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,674
Sit down! Down!

20
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,343
Down! I said, stay down there!

21
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,434
Obviously we don't want you
doing anything with your hands...

22
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:08,520
...other than holding on for dear life.

23
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,280
On the ground! Stay on the ground!

24
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:22,117
Nobody make a move!
Nobody! Stay down!

25
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,593
Yeah!

26
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,514
You have any idea
who you're stealing from?

27
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:48,393
-You and your friends are dead.
He's out, right?

28
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,731
What--?

29
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:02,324
Where did you learn to count?

30
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:08,580
They wired this thing up with like
5000 volts. What kind of bank does that?

31
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,792
A Mob bank.
I guess the Joker's as crazy as they say.

32
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,001
Where's the alarm guy?

33
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,671
Boss told me when the guy
was done, I should take him out.

34
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,172
One less share, right?

35
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,342
Funny, he told me something similar.

36
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,969
He what? No! No!

37
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,065
That's a lot of money.

38
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,944
If this Joker guy was so smart,
he'd have had us bring a bigger car.

39
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:44,283
I'm betting the Joker told you to kill me
soon as we loaded the cash.

40
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:48,996
No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

41
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:50,831
Bus driver?

42
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,543
What bus driver?

43
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,549
School's out. Time to go.

44
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,968
That guy's not getting up, is he?

45
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,387
That's a lot of money.

46
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:11,226
What happened to the rest of the guys?

47
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,360
You think you're smart, huh?

48
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,696
The guy that hired youse...

49
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,824
...he'll just do the same to you.

50
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:29,077
Oh, criminals in this town
used to believe in things.

51
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,537
Honor...

52
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,414
...respect.

53
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,916
Look at you.
What do you believe in, huh?

54
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,376
What do you believe in?!

55
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:41,631
I believe whatever doesn't kill you
simply makes you...

56
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:44,760
...stranger.

57
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,638
Mr. Mayor, you were elected
in a campaign to clean up the city.

58
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,973
-When are you gonna start?
I already have.

59
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,977
Like this Batman. We're hearing he's
doing good, criminals are running scared.

60
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,856
-No, man. I don't like it tonight.
-What are you, superstitious?

61
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:43,110
You got more chance of winning
the Powerball than running into him.

62
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:46,655
That's not true. Our men in the
Major Crimes Unit are close to an arrest.

63
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,783
Hey, Wuertz, mayor says
you're closing in on the Batman.

64
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,077
The investigation is ongoing.

65
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,663
The process of cleaning up
the streets is a long one.

66
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,832
I pledged in my campaign, uh, to have....

67
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,463
Ever intending to see your wife again,
lieutenant?

68
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,299
I thought you had to
go look after your mother, detective.

69
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,427
Checked her back into the hospital.

70
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:10,512
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:14,307
-So he hasn't shown up?
-He often doesn't.

72
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,853
-I like reminding everybody he's out there.
-Why wouldn't he come?

73
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,021
Hopefully...

74
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,065
...because he's busy.

75
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,710
That's why we bring dogs.

76
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,212
-My little princes.
Please.

77
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,966
Please, they're crawling in my mouth.
Please, I beg you, get them off.

78
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,886
Look what your drugs
do to my customers.

79
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,679
Buyer beware.

80
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,057
I told you my compound
would take you places.

81
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:58,977
I never said they'd be places
you wanted to go.

82
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:01,688
My business, repeat customers.

83
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:05,484
You don't like what I have
to offer, you can buy from someone else.

84
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,403
Assuming Batman left anyone
to buy from.

85
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,744
My dogs are hungry.

86
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,750
Pity there's only one of you.

87
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,384
What--?
That's not him.

88
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,516
Loose the dogs!

89
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:51,780
That's more like it.

90
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,620
Don't let me find you out here again.

91
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,623
-We're trying to help you.
I don't need help.

92
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,124
Not my diagnosis.

93
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,878
What gives you the right?
What's the difference between you and me?

94
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,922
I'm not wearing hockey pads.

95
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,386
Everybody back now!

96
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,725
He can't resist showing us his face.

97
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,148
What's he hiding under that makeup?

98
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:00,533
Uh, can we get a minute, people, please?

99
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,330
Him again. Who are the others?

100
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,082
Another bunch of smalltimers.

101
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,168
Some of the marked bills I gave you.

102
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,629
My detectives have been
making drug buys with them.

103
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,382
This bank was another drop for the Mob.
That makes five.

104
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:18,134
-We found the bulk of their dirty cash.
-Time to move in.

105
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:22,097
We'd have to hit all banks simultaneously.
SWAT teams, backup.

106
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,099
What about this Joker guy?

107
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:27,227
One man or the entire Mob? He can wait.

108
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,729
When the new DA hears about this,
he'll want in.

109
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:32,440
-Do you trust him?
-Be hard to keep him out.

110
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:36,069
I hear he's as stubborn as you are.

111
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,574
Be nice when Wayne Manor's rebuilt.

112
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,452
You can swap
not sleeping in a penthouse...

113
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,162
...for not sleeping in a mansion.

114
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,082
Whenever you stitch yourself up,
you do make a bloody mess.

115
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,252
Yeah. It makes me learn
from my mistakes.

116
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,839
You ought to be pretty knowledgeable
by now, then.

117
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,592
My armor.

118
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,345
I'm carrying too much weight.
I need to be-- I need to be faster.

119
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,182
I'm sure Mr. Fox can oblige.

120
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:49,851
-Did you get mauled by a tiger?
-It was a dog.

121
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,562
-Huh?
-It was a big dog.

122
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:56,608
There were more copycats last night,
Alfred, with guns.

123
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,693
Why not hire them,
take the weekend off?

124
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:01,696
That wasn't exactly
what I had in mind...

125
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,700
-...when I said I wanted to inspire people.
-I know.

126
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:07,368
But things have improved.

127
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,038
Look at the new district attorney.

128
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,707
I am, closely.

129
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,793
Need to know if he can be trusted.

130
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:19,005
Are you interested in his character
or his social circle?

131
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:25,220
Who Rachel spends her time with
is her business.

132
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,265
I trust you don't have me followed
on my day off.

133
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,518
If you ever took one, I might.

134
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,230
Know your limits, Master Wayne.

135
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:38,525
Batman has no limits.

136
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:41,736
-Well, you do, sir.
-Well, can't afford to know them.

137
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,405
And what's gonna happen
on the day that you find out?

138
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:47,283
We all know how much you like to say
"I told you so."

139
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:50,787
On that day, Master Wayne,
even I won't want to.

140
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:52,413
Probably.

141
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,922
Sorry I'm late, folks.

142
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,053
-Where were you?
-Worried you'd have to step up?

143
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,223
-Harvey, I know these briefs backwards.
-Well, then...

144
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:12,392
...fair's fair.

145
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,602
Heads, I'll take it. Tails, he's all yours.

146
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,855
Yeah? You wanna
flip a coin to see who leads?

147
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,441
My father's lucky coin. As I recall,
it got me my first date with you.

148
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,778
I wouldn't leave something like that
up to chance.

149
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,198
I don't. I make my own luck.

150
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,745
All rise.
The Honorable Judge Freel presiding.

151
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,582
I thought the DA just
played golf with the mayor.

152
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:39,460
Teeoff's 1:30. More than enough time
to put you away for life, Sally.

153
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,170
With Carmine Falcone in Arkham...

154
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:44,340
...someone must have stepped up
to run the so-called family.

155
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:47,468
Is that man in this courtroom today?

156
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,640
-Could you identify him for us, please?
-You win, counselor.

157
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,477
It was me.

158
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,983
I have a sworn statement from you
that this man...

159
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,862
...Salvatore Maroni, is the new head
of the Falcone crime family.

160
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:10,158
Maroni? He's a fall guy.
I'm the brains of the organization.

161
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,828
Order.
-Permission to treat the witness as hostile?

162
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,705
-Granted.
-Hostile? I'll show you hostile!

163
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:24,672
Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China.

164
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,760
If you wanna kill a public servant,
Mr. Maroni, I recommend you buy American.

165
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,305
Get him out of here.
-But, Your Honor, I'm not done.

166
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:39,312
We'll never be able to link the gun
to Maroni, so we can't charge him.

167
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,273
But they're trying to kill you,
means we're getting to them.

168
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,568
I'm glad you're so pleased, Rachel.
I'm fine, by the way.

169
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,445
Come on, Harvey. You're Gotham's DA.

170
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,448
You're not getting shot at,
you're not doing your job right.

171
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,824
But, you know...

172
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,328
...if you said you were rattled,
we could take the rest of the day off.

173
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,414
Can't. I dragged the head of
the Major Crimes Unit down here.

174
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:03,336
Oh, Jim Gordon? He's a friend, actually.
Try to be nice.

175
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:15,181
I hear you got a hell of a right cross.

176
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,603
It's a shame Sal's going to walk.

177
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,816
Yeah, well, good thing about the Mob
is they keep giving you second chances.

178
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,323
Lightly irradiated bills.

179
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,076
Fancy stuff for a city cop. Have help?

180
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:37,245
We liaise with various agencies--

181
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,163
Save it, Gordon. I wanna meet him.

182
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,917
Official policy is to arrest the vigilante
known as Batman on sight.

183
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,253
Mm-hm. What about that floodlight
on the top of MCU?

184
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,839
If you got problems
with malfunctioning equipment...

185
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:51,217
...I suggest you take them up
with Maintenance, counselor.

186
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,053
I've put every money launderer
in Gotham behind bars...

187
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,597
...but the Mob
is still getting its money out.

188
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,226
I think you and your friend
have found the last game in town.

189
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,104
You're trying to hit them
where it hurts, their wallets.

190
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,439
It's bold.

191
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,524
You gonna count me in?

192
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,445
In this town, the fewer people know
something, the safer the operation.

193
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:12,864
I don't like that you got
your own special unit...

194
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,950
...and it's full of cops
I investigated at Internal Affairs.

195
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,953
If I didn't work with cops
you'd investigated while at IA...

196
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,371
...I'd be working alone.

197
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:25,626
I don't get political points for being an
idealist. I do the best I can with what I have.

198
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:32,967
You want me to back warrants
for search and seizure on five banks...

199
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,969
...without telling me what we're after.

200
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,639
I can give you the names of the banks.

201
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,725
Well, that's a start.

202
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,436
I'll get you your warrants,
but I want your trust.

203
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:47,440
Oh, you don't have to sell me, Dent.
We all know you're Gotham's white knight.

204
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:52,153
Yeah, well, I heard they have
a different name for me down at MCU.

205
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,072
I wouldn't know about that.

206
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:58,993
In China, Lau Security Investments
stands for dynamic new growth.

207
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:03,456
A joint Chinese venture with
Wayne Enterprises will be a powerhouse.

208
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,541
Well, Mr. Lau...

209
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,669
...I speak for the rest of the board...

210
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,173
...and Mr. Wayne,
in expressing our own excitement.

211
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:20,681
Sir, I know Mr. Wayne is curious about
how his trust fund gets replenished...

212
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:23,351
...but, frankly, this is embarrassing.

213
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:26,104
You worry about the diligence,
Mr. Reese.

214
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:28,564
I'll worry about Bruce Wayne.

215
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,274
It's done.

216
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,193
The numbers are solid.

217
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,903
Do them again.

218
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:37,156
Wouldn't want the trust fund to run out,
now, would we?

219
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,494
Another long night?

220
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,622
This joint venture was your idea,
and the consultants love it.

221
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,541
But I'm not convinced.

222
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:50,378
Lau's company has grown by
8 percent annually like clockwork.

223
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,964
His revenue stream
must be off the books...

224
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,549
...maybe even illegal.

225
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,384
Okay. Cancel the deal.

226
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,886
You already knew.

227
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:02,140
Just needed a closer look at their books.

228
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,350
Anything else you can trouble me for?

229
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,352
I need a new suit.

230
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,021
Yeah. Three buttons
is a little '90s, Mr. Wayne.

231
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,316
I'm not talking fashion, Mr. Fox,
so much as function.

232
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,069
You wanna be able to turn your head.

233
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,321
Sure make backing out
of the driveway easier.

234
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,323
I'll see what I can do.

235
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,038
Took three weeks
to get a reservation here.

236
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,332
I had to tell them
I work for the government.

237
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,169
-Really?
-Health inspector's not afraid to pull strings.

238
00:19:31,336 --> 00:19:33,546
Rachel. Fancy that.

239
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,215
Yeah, Bruce. Fancy that.

240
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,718
Rachel, Natascha. Natascha, Rachel.

241
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:44,265
-Natascha. Are you the prima--?
-Prima ballerina for the Moscow Ballet.

242
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,768
-Wow. Harvey's taking me next week.
-Really? So you're into ballet?

243
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,271
Bruce. This is Harvey Dent.

244
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:54,358
The famous Bruce Wayne.
Rachel's told me everything about you.

245
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,735
I certainly hope not.

246
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,405
-Let's put a couple tables together.
-I'm not sure that they'll let us.

247
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,617
Oh, they should. I own the place.

248
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:06,037
How could you want to raise children
in a city like this?

249
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,916
-Well, I was raised here. I turned out okay.
-Is Wayne Manor in the city limits?

250
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,584
Is--? Heh-heh.

251
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,294
The Palisades? Sure.

252
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:17,924
You know, as our new DA, you might wanna
figure out where your jurisdiction ends.

253
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:22,053
I'm talking about the kind of city
that idolizes a masked vigilante.

254
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,598
Gotham City is proud of an ordinary citizen
standing up for what's right.

255
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,017
Gotham needs heroes like you,
elected officials...

256
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:31,479
-...not a man who thinks he's above the law.
-Who appointed the Batman?

257
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:35,483
We did. All of us who stood by
and let scum take control of our city.

258
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,401
But this is a democracy, Harvey.

259
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,320
When their enemies were at the gates...

260
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,199
...the Romans would suspend democracy
and appoint one man to protect the city.

261
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,952
It wasn't considered an honor,
it was a public service.

262
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:50,248
Harvey, the last man that they appointed to
protect the republic was named Caesar...

263
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:53,834
-...and he never gave up his power.
-Okay, fine.

264
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,336
You either die a hero...

265
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,547
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

266
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:02,218
Whoever the Batman is, he doesn't
wanna do this for the rest of his life.

267
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,638
How could he? Batman is looking for
someone to take up his mantle.

268
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:08,099
Someone like you, Mr. Dent?

269
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:11,018
Maybe. If I'm up to it.

270
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:16,440
What if Harvey Dent
is the Caped Crusader? Hm?

271
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,862
If I were sneaking out every night,
someone would've noticed by now.

272
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:28,369
Well, I'm sold, Dent,
and I'm gonna throw you a fundraiser.

273
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:31,372
That's nice, but I'm not
up for reelection for three years.

274
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,457
No, you don't understand.

275
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,419
One fundraiser with my pals...

276
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,213
...you'll never need another cent.

277
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:56,022
What the hell is this?

278
00:21:57,357 --> 00:22:00,484
As you're all aware,
one of our deposits was stolen.

279
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:04,030
A relatively small amount, 68 million.

280
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,741
Who's stupid enough to steal from us?

281
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:10,619
Two-bit wackjob,
wears a cheap purple suit and makeup.

282
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,747
He's not the problem. He's a nobody.

283
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:16,292
The problem is our money
being tracked by the cops.

284
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,961
Thanks to Mr. Maroni's
well-placed sources...

285
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:22,923
...we know that police have indeed
identified our banks using marked bills...

286
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,593
...and are planning to
seize your funds today.

287
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,764
And since the enthusiastic new DA has
put all my competitors out of business...

288
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,893
-...I'm your only option.
So, what are you proposing?

289
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:37,730
Moving all deposits to
one secure location, not a bank.

290
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,857
-Where, then?
-No one can know but me.

291
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:43,361
If the police were to gain leverage
over one of you...

292
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:45,321
...everyone's money would be at stake.

293
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,615
What stop them getting to you?

294
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:50,868
I go to Hong Kong,
far from Dent's jurisdiction...

295
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:54,121
...and the Chinese will not extradite
one of their own.

296
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,915
How soon can you move the money?

297
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,291
I already have.

298
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:02,296
For obvious reasons, I couldn't wait
for your permission.

299
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,592
Rest assured, your money is safe.

300
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:18,771
Oh, hee-hee, aha.
Ha, ooh, hee, ha-ha, ha-ha.

301
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:21,190
And I thought my jokes were bad.

302
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:24,443
Give me one reason why I shouldn't
have my boy pull your head off.

303
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:25,903
How about a magic trick?

304
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,575
I'm gonna make this pencil disappear.

305
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,995
Ta-da!

306
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:36,664
It's--

307
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:39,125
It's gone.

308
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,836
Oh, and by the way,
the suit, it wasn't cheap.

309
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,839
-You ought to know, you bought it.
Sit.

310
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,968
I want to hear proposition.

311
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,181
Let's wind the clocks back a year.

312
00:23:54,516 --> 00:24:00,187
These cops and lawyers
wouldn't dare cross any of you.

313
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,482
I mean, what happened?

314
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,445
Did your balls drop off? Hm?

315
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,655
You see, a guy like me....

316
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,867
-A freak.
Damn right.

317
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:16,162
A guy like me-- Look, listen.

318
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:21,000
I know why you choose
to have your little, ahem...

319
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,878
...group-therapy sessions
in broad daylight.

320
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,173
I know why you're afraid
to go out at night.

321
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,051
The Batman.

322
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:36,474
See, Batman has shown Gotham
your true colors, unfortunately.

323
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:40,144
Dent, he's just the beginning.

324
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:45,483
And as for the television's
so-called plan...

325
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,818
...Batman has no jurisdiction.

326
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,571
He'll find him and make him squeal.

327
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:53,741
I know the squealers when I see them...

328
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:55,576
...and....

329
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,828
What do you propose?

330
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,414
It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

331
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,710
If it's so simple, why haven't
you done it already?

332
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,588
If you're good at something,
never do it for free.

333
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,548
How much you want?

334
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,259
Uh, half.

335
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:17,223
You're crazy.
-No, I'm not.

336
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,517
No, I'm not.

337
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:24,522
If we don't deal with this now...

338
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:26,315
...soon...

339
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:31,445
...little Gambol here won't be able
to get a nickel for his grandma.

340
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,572
Enough from the clown!

341
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,700
Ah, ta-ta-ta. Let's not blow...

342
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,411
Shit!
-...this out of proportion.

343
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,081
You think you can steal from us
and just walk away?

344
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,791
-Yeah.
I'm putting the word out.

345
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:46,252
Five hundred grand for this clown dead.

346
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,463
A million alive, so I can teach him
some manners first.

347
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,342
All right. So, listen,
why don't you give me a call...

348
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:57,263
...when you wanna start taking things
a little more seriously?

349
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,306
Here's my card.

350
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,396
Mm-mm.

351
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,787
You're a hard man to reach.

352
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:27,084
Lau's halfway to Hong Kong.

353
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:31,213
If you'd have asked,
I could have taken his passport.

354
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,049
All that was left in the vaults
were marked bills.

355
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:37,511
They knew we were coming.
As soon as your office got involved--

356
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,679
My office?

357
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:42,558
You're sitting down there with scum like
Wuertz and Ramirez and you're talking--

358
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,853
Oh, yeah. I almost had your rookie
cold on a racketeering beat.

359
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:50,566
Don't try and cloud the fact that clearly
Maroni's got people in your office, Dent.

360
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,321
We need Lau back...

361
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:59,450
...but the Chinese won't extradite
a national under any circumstances.

362
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,494
If I get him to you,
can you get him to talk?

363
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,871
I'll get him to sing.

364
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:06,790
We're going after the Mob's life savings.

365
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:08,208
Things will get ugly.

366
00:27:08,376 --> 00:27:10,669
I knew the risk when I took this job,
lieutenant.

367
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,379
How will you get him back, any--?

368
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,383
He does that.

369
00:27:16,551 --> 00:27:20,054
Our Chinese friends left town
before I could tell them the deal was off.

370
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,724
Well, I'm sure that you've always wanted
to go to Hong Kong.

371
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,060
What's wrong with a phone call?

372
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:29,855
I think Mr. Lau deserves
a more personal touch.

373
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:35,861
Now, for high-altitude jumps,
you're going to need oxygen and stabilizers.

374
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:39,657
Well, I must say,
compared to your usual requests...

375
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,409
...jumping out of an airplane
is pretty straightforward.

376
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,162
What about getting back into the plane?

377
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,166
-I'd recommend a good travel agent.
-Without it landing.

378
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:53,087
Now, that's more like it, Mr. Wayne.

379
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:56,256
The CIA had a program back in the '60s...

380
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,760
...for getting their people out of hot spots
called Sky Hook.

381
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,596
-We could look into that.
-Yeah.

382
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,431
Okay. Now....

383
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:10,938
Hardened Kevlar plates over titanium-dipped
tri-weave fibers for flexibility.

384
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,941
You'll be lighter, faster, more agile.

385
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:19,613
Perhaps you should
read the instructions first?

386
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,782
-Yeah.
-Now, there is a tradeoff.

387
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,452
Separation of the plates makes you
more vulnerable to knives and gunfire.

388
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:28,580
We wouldn't wanna make things
too easy, now, would we?

389
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,791
How will it hold up against dogs?

390
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,085
We talking Rottweilers or Chihuahuas?

391
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,797
Should do fine against cats.

392
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,091
I found one in Arizona.

393
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,429
A very nice man said he could have it up
and running in a week, and he takes cash.

394
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,432
-What about the flight crew?
-South Korean smugglers.

395
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,809
They run flights into Pyongyang,
below radar.

396
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,729
-Did you think of an alibi?
-Oh, yes.

397
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,125
I believe this is your plane, sir.

398
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,841
You look tired, Alfred.
You'll be all right without me?

399
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,013
If you can tell me the Russian for
"apply your own bloody suntan lotion."

400
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,986
Yo, Gambol, somebody here for you.
They say they've just killed the Joker.

401
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:42,988
They brought the body.

402
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,882
So, dead, that's 500.

403
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,636
How about alive? Hm?

404
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,017
You wanna know how I got these scars?

405
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,939
My father was...

406
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,565
...a drinker...

407
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:19,983
...and a fiend.

408
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,988
And one night,
he goes off crazier than usual.

409
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:28,200
Mommy gets the kitchen knife
to defend herself.

410
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,910
He doesn't like that...

411
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,539
...not one bit.

412
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,250
So, me watching...

413
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:41,004
...he takes the knife to her,
laughing while he does it.

414
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:44,258
He turns to me and he says:

415
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:48,095
"Why so serious?"

416
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,930
He comes at me with the knife.

417
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,516
"Why so serious?"

418
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,646
He sticks the blade in my mouth.

419
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,900
"Let's put a smile on that face."

420
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,320
And....

421
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,241
Why so serious?

422
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,789
Now...

423
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,208
...our operation is small...

424
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,295
...but there is a lot of potential...

425
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:24,006
...for aggressive expansion.

426
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,384
So which of you fine gentlemen
would like to join our team?

427
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:31,972
Oh. There's only one spot open right now,
so we're gonna have...

428
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,808
...tryouts.

429
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,398
Make it fast.

430
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,242
Welcome to Hong Kong, Mr. Fox.

431
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,120
Mr. Lau regrets he is unable
to greet you in person today.

432
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,205
I understand.

433
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,594
For security purposes, I'm gonna have to
ask you to check in your mobile.

434
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,346
Of course.

435
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,810
I must apologize for leaving Gotham
in the middle of our negotiations.

436
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:22,522
This misunderstanding
with the Gotham police force...

437
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:25,233
-...I couldn't let it threaten my company.
-Of course.

438
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:28,570
A businessman of your stature
will understand and...

439
00:32:28,738 --> 00:32:32,699
...with you here now, we can continue.

440
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:36,620
Well, I do appreciate you bringing me
out here in such style, Mr. Lau, but I re--

441
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,998
We do not allow cell phones in here.

442
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,876
I'm sorry. Forgot I had it.

443
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,673
No, I really came to tell you that
our business deal has to be put on hold.

444
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,301
You see, we can't afford
to be seen to do business with...

445
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,388
...whatever it is you're accused of being.

446
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,140
I'm sure a businessman of your stature
will understand.

447
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:01,228
I think, Mr. Fox, a simple phone call
might have sufficed.

448
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,773
Mr. Wayne didn't want you to think
he was deliberately wasting your time.

449
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:06,566
Just accidentally wasting it.

450
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:11,738
That's very good, Mr. Lau.
"Accidentally." Very good.

451
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,865
Hey, sir.

452
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:34,094
There's a better view from the peak tram.

453
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,096
How's the view from LSI Holdings?

454
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,931
Restricted.

455
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,100
Lau is holed up in there good and tight.

456
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,185
-What's this?
-I had R & D work it up.

457
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,021
Sends out a high-frequency pulse...

458
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:47,024
...records the response time
for mapping an environment.

459
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,110
Sonar. Just like a....

460
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:52,446
Submarine, Mr. Wayne. Like a submarine.

461
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,781
-And the other device?
-It's in place.

462
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,742
Mr. Wayne?

463
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,244
Good luck.

464
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:52,394
Look, give us the money
and we'll talk about making a deal.

465
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:55,855
The money is the only reason
I'm still alive.

466
00:37:56,023 --> 00:38:00,151
Oh, you mean, when they find out that
you've helped us, they're gonna kill you?

467
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,028
-Are you threatening my client?
-No.

468
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:06,408
I'm just assuming your client's
cooperation with this investigation.

469
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,703
As will everyone.

470
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,374
No? Okay.

471
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,836
Enjoy your time in County, Mr. Lau.

472
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:19,504
Wait!

473
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,715
I won't give you the money...

474
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:24,884
...but I will give you my clients,
all of them.

475
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:27,387
You were a glorified accountant.

476
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:31,391
What could you possibly have
on all of them that we could charge?

477
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:35,395
I'm good with calculation.
I handled all their investments.

478
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:37,147
One big pot.

479
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:39,858
Got it.

480
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:42,110
One minute.

481
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:47,574
RICO. If they pooled their money, we can
charge them as one criminal conspiracy.

482
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,908
Charge them with what?

483
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,953
In a RICO case, if you can charge
one of them with a felony--

484
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:54,706
You can charge all of them with it.
That's great.

485
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,001
Mr. Lau.

486
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:03,006
What kind of details do you have
about this communal fund?

487
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,799
-Ledgers--?
-Immunity, protection...

488
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:08,428
-...a chartered plane back to Hong Kong.
-After you testify in open court.

489
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,930
I'm just curious.
With all your clients locked up...

490
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:13,475
...what's gonna happen
with all that money?

491
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,770
Like I said, I'm good with calculation.

492
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:21,608
He can't go to County.
I'll keep him here in the holding cells.

493
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,319
What is this, Gordon, your fortress?

494
00:39:24,612 --> 00:39:27,280
Well, you trust them over at County?

495
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,282
I don't trust them here.

496
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,535
Lau stays.

497
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:37,540
Well, I don't know about Mr. Lau's travel
arrangements, but I'm sure glad he's back.

498
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,168
Put word out. We hire the clown.

499
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:46,800
He was right.
We have to fix real problem.

500
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,426
Batman.

501
00:39:52,973 --> 00:39:56,893
-I'm not aware of any participation....
-Our boy looks good on the tube.

502
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:00,146
You sure you wanna embarrass me
in front of my friends?

503
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,983
Oh, don't worry. They're coming too.

504
00:40:10,825 --> 00:40:12,659
Have a nice trip. See you next fall.

505
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,661
Seven hundred twelve counts of extortion.

506
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:17,247
Eight hundred and forty-nine
counts of racketeering.

507
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:22,961
Two hundred and forty-six counts of fraud.
Eighty-seven counts of conspiracy murder.

508
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:27,006
Five hundred and twenty-seven
counts of obstruction of justice.

509
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,800
How do the defendants plead?

510
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,016
Order in the court.

511
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,686
Five hundred and forty-nine
criminals at once.

512
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:42,355
How did you convince Surrillo
to hear this farce?

513
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:46,651
She shares my enthusiasm for justice.
After all, she is a judge.

514
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,863
Even if you blow enough smoke
to get convictions out of Surrillo...

515
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,615
...you're gonna set
a new record at appeals.

516
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,285
It won't matter.
The head guys make bail, sure.

517
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,871
But the midlevel guys, they can't.

518
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:02,167
They can't afford to be off the streets.
They'll cut deals that include some jail time.

519
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:05,336
Think of all you could do
with 18 months of clean streets.

520
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,008
Mr. Mayor, you can't--
-No, get out. Both of you.

521
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,722
Sit down.

522
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,688
The public likes you.
That's the only reason that this might fly.

523
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,190
But that means it's on you.

524
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:28,401
They're all gonna come after you now,
and not just the Mob.

525
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,405
Politicians, journalists, cops.

526
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:35,074
Anyone whose wallet's
about to get lighter.

527
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,911
Are you up to it? You'd better be.

528
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,205
Because they get anything on you...

529
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:45,168
...and those criminals are back on the
streets, followed swiftly by you and me.

530
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:46,628
Jesus!

531
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:10,235
I think your fundraiser
will be a great success, sir.

532
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,071
And why do you think I wanna
hold a party for Harvey Dent?

533
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,324
I assumed it was your usual reason
for socializing beyond myself...

534
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,535
...and the scum of Gotham's underbelly:

535
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,495
To try to impress Miss Dawes.

536
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:24,749
Very droll, but very wrong.
Actually, it's Dent.

537
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,794
Police released
video footage found concealed on the body.

538
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:30,588
Sensitive viewers, be aware.
The image is disturbing.

539
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,966
Tell them your name.

540
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,801
Brian Douglas.

541
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,721
And are you the real Batman?

542
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:39,931
No.
No?

543
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,058
-No.
-No?

544
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,935
Then why do you dress up like him?

545
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,479
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

546
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:50,775
Because he's a symbol that we
don't have to be afraid of scum like you.

547
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:54,279
Yeah. You do, Brian. You really do.

548
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:58,074
Huh? Yeah. Oh, shh, shh, shh.

549
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:02,704
So you think Batman's
made Gotham a better place? Hm?

550
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,455
Look at me.

551
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,916
Look at me!

552
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:14,173
You see, this is how crazy
Batman's made Gotham.

553
00:43:14,341 --> 00:43:16,634
You want order in Gotham...

554
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:21,389
...Batman must take off his mask
and turn himself in.

555
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:25,351
Oh, and every day he doesn't,
people will die.

556
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,812
Starting tonight.

557
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:30,440
I'm a man of my word.

558
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,543
Harvey Dent,
scourge of the underworld...

559
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,796
...scared stiff by the trust-fund brigade.

560
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,214
-I'll be back.
-Rachel.

561
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,217
A little liquid courage, Mr. Dent?

562
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,803
-Thank you. Alfred, right?
-That's right, sir.

563
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,265
Rachel talks about you all the time.
You've known her her whole life.

564
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:05,683
Not yet, sir.

565
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,229
Any psychotic ex-boyfriends
I should be aware of?

566
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,649
Oh, you have no idea.

567
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:35,546
I'm sorry that I'm late. I'm glad
to see that you all got started without me.

568
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:39,425
Now, where is Harvey? Where--?

569
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:42,011
Harvey Dent, the man of the hour.

570
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,513
Where's Rachel Dawes?

571
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:46,057
She is my oldest friend. Come here.

572
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:50,103
When Rachel first told me she was dating
Harvey Dent, I had one thing to say:

573
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,730
"The guy from those God-awful
campaign commercials?"

574
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:56,734
"I believe in Harvey Dent."
Yeah, nice slogan, Harvey.

575
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,903
But it caught Rachel's attention.

576
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:02,073
And then I started to pay attention
to Harvey...

577
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,785
...and all that he's been doing
as our new DA.

578
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,745
And you know what?

579
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:11,290
I believe in Harvey Dent.

580
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:15,044
I believe that on his watch,
Gotham can feel...

581
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,881
...a little safer, a little more optimistic.

582
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,637
Look at this face. This is the face
of Gotham's bright future.

583
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:26,973
To Harvey Dent. Let's hear it for him.

584
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,891
Harvey.

585
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,988
Harvey may not know you well enough
to understand you're making fun of him...

586
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,157
-...but I do.
-No, I meant every word.

587
00:45:45,492 --> 00:45:48,411
You know that day
that you once told me about...

588
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,663
...when Gotham would no longer
need Batman?

589
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,749
-It's coming.
-Bruce.

590
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:59,172
-You can't ask me to wait for that.
-It's happening now. Harvey is that hero.

591
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:03,801
He locked up half of the city's criminals,
and he did it without wearing a mask.

592
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,179
Gotham needs a hero with a face.

593
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,307
You can throw a party, Wayne,
I'll give you that.

594
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,602
Thanks again.

595
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,104
You mind if I borrow Rachel?

596
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:22,862
Lieutenant, that joker card pinned to the
body? Forensics found three sets of DNA.

597
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,447
-Any matches?
-All three.

598
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:28,117
The DNA belongs to Judge Surrillo,
Harvey Dent and Commissioner Loeb.

599
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,286
The Joker's telling us who he's targeting.

600
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,331
Get a unit over to Surrillo's house.
Tell Wuertz to find Dent.

601
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:35,541
Protective custody.
Where's the commissioner?

602
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,210
-City hall.
-Seal the building.

603
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,378
-No one in or out till I get there.
-Got it.

604
00:46:51,683 --> 00:46:54,060
Gordon. What are you up to?

605
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:57,480
We're secure. I want a floor-by-floor search
of the entire building.

606
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,233
We believe the Joker's
made a threat against your life.

607
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,818
These are dangerous people.

608
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:05,863
-You're not giving me a lot of information.
-Even we don't know where you're going.

609
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:09,367
Take the envelope, get in, open it.
It'll tell you where you're headed.

610
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:15,122
You can't leave me alone
with these people.

611
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:18,334
The whole Mob's after you
and you're worried about these guys?

612
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,461
Compared to this,
the Mob doesn't scare me.

613
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,215
Gordon, you're unlikely to discover this
for yourself, so...

614
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,469
...take my word, the police commissioner
earns a lot of threats.

615
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:34,183
I found the appropriate response
to these situations a long time ago.

616
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,644
Them gunning for you
makes you see things clearly.

617
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,145
Yeah, I bet.

618
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:42,608
Yeah. It makes you think about things
you couldn't stand losing...

619
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,777
...about who you wanna
spend your life with.

620
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,947
-That's a pretty big commitment.
-Not if the Mob has their way.

621
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:55,872
You get to explain to my wife...

622
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:58,374
...why I'm late for dinner.

623
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,711
Sir, the joker card
had traces of your DNA on it.

624
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,923
-Don't do that.
-All right.

625
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:09,385
-Let's be serious, then.
-Okay.

626
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,761
What's your answer?

627
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:18,436
I don't have an answer.

628
00:48:20,606 --> 00:48:21,647
How'd they get my DNA?

629
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,983
Somebody with access
to your office or house...

630
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,777
...must have lifted a tissue
or a glass-- Wait! Wait!

631
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:29,864
-Well, I guess no answer is a no.
-Harvey.

632
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,158
-It's someone else, isn't it?
-Harvey.

633
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:35,494
Just tell me it's not Wayne.
The guy's a complete f--

634
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,455
What are you doing?

635
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,675
Oh, shit.

636
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,600
Get a medic!

637
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,146
They've come for him.

638
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:04,815
We made it.

639
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,444
Stay hidden.

640
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:14,033
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

641
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:20,873
We are tonight's entertainment.

642
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:24,043
I only have one question:

643
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,797
Where is Harvey Dent?

644
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:39,350
You know where Harvey is?
You know who he is?

645
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,810
Hands up, pretty boy.

646
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,736
Do you know where I can find Harvey?
I need to talk to him.

647
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:53,739
Just something little, huh? No.

648
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:58,786
What's going on out there? Wayne!

649
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,957
-Oh, thank God, you've got a panic room.
Hey, wait--

650
00:50:03,542 --> 00:50:05,334
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

651
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,628
You know, I'll settle for his loved ones.

652
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:11,298
We're not intimidated by thugs.

653
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:13,968
You know...

654
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:18,597
...you remind me of my father.

655
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:20,891
I hated my father.

656
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,102
Okay, stop.

657
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:29,775
Well, hello, beautiful.

658
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,781
You must be Harvey's squeeze. Hm?

659
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,659
And you are beautiful.

660
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:49,462
You look nervous. Is it the scars?

661
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,590
You wanna know how I got them?

662
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,343
Come here. Hey.

663
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,429
Look at me.

664
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:03,642
So I had a wife.
She was beautiful, like you...

665
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:08,105
...who tells me I worry too much...

666
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,192
...who tells me I ought to smile more...

667
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:16,864
...who gambles and gets in deep
with the sharks. Hey.

668
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:19,700
One day they carve her face.

669
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:24,455
And we have no money for surgeries.
She can't take it.

670
00:51:24,831 --> 00:51:28,334
I just wanna see her smile again. Hm?

671
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:31,587
I just want her to know
that I don't care about the scars.

672
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:33,672
So...

673
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,927
...I stick a razor in my mouth
and do this...

674
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,762
...to myself.

675
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:45,142
And you know what?
She can't stand the sight of me.

676
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,852
She leaves.

677
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:49,980
Now I see the funny side.

678
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,441
Now I'm always smiling.

679
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:59,198
You got a little fight in you. I like that.

680
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,699
Then you're gonna love me.

681
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:30,062
Drop the gun.

682
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:35,234
Oh, sure. You just take off your little mask
and show us all who you really are. Hm?

683
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,074
Let her go.

684
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:44,285
Very poor choice of words.

685
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,976
Are you all right?

686
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:13,606
Let's not do that again.

687
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,400
-Is Harvey okay?
-He's safe.

688
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:19,278
Thank you.

689
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,613
Jim, it's over.

690
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,449
As long as they don't get to Lau,
we've cut off their funds.

691
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:26,660
The prosecution's over.
Nobody's standing up in front of a judge...

692
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,080
...while judges and police commissioners
are getting blown away.

693
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:33,292
-What about Dent?
-He's got any sense, Dent's halfway to Mex--

694
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,044
So where do you keep your trash?

695
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:40,341
You're due in court. I need you alive
long enough to get you on the record.

696
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:43,552
You can't protect me.
You can't even protect yourselves.

697
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,056
You refuse to cooperate, you're not
coming back here, you go to County.

698
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,683
How long do you calculate
you'll last in there?

699
00:53:51,102 --> 00:53:54,605
Targeting me won't get their money.
I knew the Mob wouldn't go down easily...

700
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:58,275
-...but this is different. They crossed a line.
-You crossed the line first.

701
00:53:58,443 --> 00:54:01,862
You squeezed them, you hammered them
to the point of desperation.

702
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:07,034
And in their desperation, they turned to
a man they didn't fully understand.

703
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,079
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

704
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,456
We just need to figure out
what he's after.

705
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,041
With respect, Master Wayne...

706
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,169
...perhaps this is a man
you don't fully understand either.

707
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,673
A long time ago, I was in Burma...

708
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,260
...and my friends and I were working
for the local government.

709
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,012
They were trying to buy
the loyalty of tribal leaders...

710
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:30,015
...by bribing them with precious stones...

711
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:34,770
...but their caravans were being raided
in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

712
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,232
So we went looking for the stones.

713
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:43,737
But in six months, we never
met anyone who traded with him.

714
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:48,367
One day, I saw a child
playing with a ruby...

715
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:51,578
...the size of a tangerine.

716
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:55,207
The bandit had been
throwing them away.

717
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:58,585
-So why steal them?
-Because he thought it was good sport.

718
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:03,716
Because some men aren't looking
for anything logical, like money.

719
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:08,137
They can't be bought, bullied,
reasoned or negotiated with.

720
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:12,391
Some men just wanna
watch the world burn.

721
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,996
Your name, sir?

722
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:37,333
Eighth and Orchard.
You'll find Harvey Dent there.

723
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,680
Check the names.

724
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,980
"Richard Dent."

725
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:03,275
"Patrick Harvey."

726
00:56:03,610 --> 00:56:04,610
Harvey Dent.

727
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,780
I need 10 minutes with the scene
before your men contaminate it.

728
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:11,909
-It's because of you these guys are dead--
-Detective!

729
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,163
Give us a minute, guys.

730
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,957
That's brick underneath.

731
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,960
-Gonna take ballistics off a shattered bullet?
-No.

732
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:26,131
Fingerprints.

733
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,600
Whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

734
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:43,107
Because we found his next target.
He's put it in tomorrow's paper.

735
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,709
I'm not sure
you made it loud enough, sir.

736
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:17,933
What can I do for you, Mr. Reese?

737
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,895
You wanted me to do the diligence
on the LSI Holdings deal again.

738
00:57:22,564 --> 00:57:24,857
Well, I found some irregularities.

739
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,359
Their CEO is in police custody.

740
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:30,446
No, not with their numbers, with yours.

741
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:35,576
Applied Sciences. Whole division of Wayne
Enterprises just disappeared overnight.

742
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:39,997
I went down to the archives
and I started pulling some old files.

743
00:57:41,124 --> 00:57:46,795
Don't tell me you didn't recognize your baby
pancaking cop cars on the evening news.

744
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:50,299
Now you got the entire R & D Department
burning through cash...

745
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:53,802
...claiming it's related to
cell phones for the Army?

746
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:57,055
What are you building for him now,
a rocket ship?

747
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,684
I want...

748
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,771
...$10 million a year
for the rest of my life.

749
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,401
Let me get this straight.

750
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:13,071
You think that your client...

751
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:18,076
...one of the wealthiest, most powerful men
in the world, is secretly a vigilante...

752
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:22,915
...who spends his nights beating criminals
to a pulp with his bare hands...

753
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,251
...and your plan
is to blackmail this person?

754
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,010
Good luck.

755
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,306
When--

756
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:42,184
Keep that.

757
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,318
This is your original scan.

758
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,030
Here it is reengineered.

759
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:06,792
And there's the thumbprint he left
when he pushed the round in the clip.

760
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:09,962
I'll get you a copy.

761
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,966
Mr. Wayne, did you reassign R & D?

762
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:16,635
Yeah. Government
telecommunications project.

763
00:59:16,803 --> 00:59:18,845
Wasn't aware
we had any government contracts.

764
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:22,099
You know, Lucius, I'm playing this one
pretty close to the chest.

765
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,935
Fair enough.

766
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:30,983
With no word from the Batman,
even as they mourn Commissioner Loeb...

767
00:59:31,150 --> 00:59:34,528
...these cops have to wonder if
the Joker will make good on his threat...

768
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:37,906
...in the obituary column of
The Gotham Times to kill the mayor.

769
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:43,370
I've checked all the databases.
There are four possibles.

770
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:45,664
Cross-reference the addresses.

771
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:49,835
Look for Parkside,
overlooking the parade.

772
00:59:51,045 --> 00:59:52,170
I got one.

773
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:56,341
Melvin White,
1502 Randolph Apartments.

774
00:59:56,718 --> 01:00:00,804
Aggravated assault,
moved to Arkham twice.

775
01:00:39,886 --> 01:00:41,470
What do you got on the roof?

776
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,182
We're tight, but frankly,
there's a lot of windows up here.

777
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:57,778
Commissioner Loeb dedicated his life
to law enforcement...

778
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,238
...and to the protection
of his community.

779
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:02,199
I remember when I first took office...

780
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:04,910
...and I asked if he wanted
to stay on as commissioner.

781
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:10,332
And he said he would, provided
I kept my politics out of his office.

782
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,255
Clearly he was not a man who minced
words, nor should he have been.

783
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:21,927
A number of policies that he enacted
as commissioner were unpopular.

784
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:25,347
Policies that flooded my office
with angry calls and letters....

785
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,395
-Who's that?
-What happened?

786
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:34,314
They took our guns.

787
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,274
And our uniforms.

788
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:45,617
And as we recognize the sacrifice
of this man...

789
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:49,746
...we must remember that vigilance
is the price of safety.

790
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,416
Stand by. Honor guard.

791
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:56,211
Attention. Port arms.

792
01:01:57,422 --> 01:02:01,800
Ready! Aim! Fire!

793
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:04,136
Ready! Aim!

794
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,142
Ready! Aim!

795
01:02:18,568 --> 01:02:19,985
Stay down! Don't move!

796
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:23,488
Mr. Mayor. Get him out of here.

797
01:02:32,707 --> 01:02:34,958
-I'll see you later.
-Why are you going back?

798
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,638
Get out of here.

799
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,436
Tell me what you know about the Joker.

800
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:26,802
No.

801
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:28,553
I'm sorry, Barbara.

802
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,724
Jimmy, go play with your sister.
Go ahead, honey.

803
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:37,062
If there's anything we can do,
anything you need, we're here for you.

804
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:40,565
Shh.

805
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,983
Are you out there?

806
01:03:43,319 --> 01:03:47,823
Are you? You brought this
craziness on us. You did!

807
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,367
You brought this on us!

808
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:55,997
Switch it off, he ain't coming.
He doesn't wanna talk to us.

809
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:59,417
God help whoever he does wanna talk to.

810
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,005
Can't we go someplace quieter?
We can't hear each other talk.

811
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,008
What makes you think
I wanna hear you talk?

812
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,218
What?

813
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:39,249
-Yeah?
Second.

814
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,458
Okay.

815
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:42,794
-Harvey, where are you?
Where are you?

816
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,798
I'm where you should be, at Major Crimes.
I'm trying to deal with all of this mess.

817
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:50,552
-Can I get the fingerprint analysis?
-Rachel, listen. You're not safe there.

818
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,512
-This is Gordon's unit.
-Gordon's gone.

819
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,266
He vouched for these men.
-And he's gone.

820
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,981
The Joker's named you next.

821
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,151
God, is there someone, is there anyone
in this town we can trust?

822
01:05:06,319 --> 01:05:08,028
Bruce.

823
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,487
We can trust Bruce Wayne.

824
01:05:09,655 --> 01:05:13,241
-No. Rachel, I know you're his friend, but--
-Harvey, trust me.

825
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:16,161
Bruce's penthouse is now
the safest place in the city.

826
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,662
Then you go straight there.

827
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,956
Don't tell anybody
and I'll find you there.

828
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,833
I love you.

829
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:37,098
I want the Joker.

830
01:05:38,309 --> 01:05:39,976
From one professional to another...

831
01:05:40,144 --> 01:05:42,687
...you're trying to scare somebody,
pick a better spot.

832
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,440
From this height,
the fall wouldn't kill me.

833
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,192
-I'm counting on it.
-Huh!

834
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:57,702
-Where is he?
-I don't know where he is. He found us.

835
01:05:57,870 --> 01:05:59,162
He must have friends.

836
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:01,790
Friends? Have you met this guy?

837
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,541
Someone knows where he is.

838
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:06,211
Nobody's gonna tell you nothing.

839
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:07,712
They're wise to your act.

840
01:06:07,880 --> 01:06:11,883
You got rules.
The Joker, he's got no rules.

841
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:16,930
Nobody's gonna cross him for you.
If you want this guy, you got one way.

842
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,890
But you already know what that is.

843
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,851
Just take off that mask,
let him come find you.

844
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:27,565
Or you can let a couple more people
get killed while you make up your mind.

845
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:31,236
You wanna play games?

846
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,576
How's that feel?

847
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:41,371
-You wouldn't.
-I wouldn't!

848
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,499
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

849
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:46,710
-You don't think I will?
-Mm-mm.

850
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:51,297
No. No, I wouldn't.

851
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,051
That's why I'm not
gonna leave it up to me.

852
01:06:56,053 --> 01:06:59,055
Heads, you get to keep your head.

853
01:06:59,473 --> 01:07:01,099
Tails...

854
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:03,101
...not so lucky.

855
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:07,022
So you wanna tell me about the Joker?

856
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:20,118
-Let's go again.
-I don't know anything! God, don't!

857
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,662
You're not playing the odds, friend.

858
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:25,790
Let's do it again.

859
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:30,462
You'd leave a man's life to chance?

860
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:34,799
-Not exactly.
-His name's Schiff, Thomas.

861
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,969
He's a paranoid schizophrenic,
former patient at Arkham.

862
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:42,766
The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
What do you expect to learn from him?

863
01:07:46,103 --> 01:07:48,897
The Joker killed Gordon.
He's gonna kill Rachel.

864
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,858
You're the symbol of hope
I could never be.

865
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,860
Your stand against organized crime...

866
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:57,238
...is the first legitimate ray of light
in Gotham in decades.

867
01:07:57,406 --> 01:08:01,034
If anyone saw this,
everything would be undone.

868
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:03,495
The criminals you arrested
would be released...

869
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:06,748
...and Jim Gordon
will have died for nothing.

870
01:08:07,374 --> 01:08:09,626
You're gonna hold
a press conference tomorrow.

871
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:12,170
-Why?
-No one else will die because of me.

872
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:14,672
Gotham's in your hands now.

873
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:16,549
You can't.

874
01:08:16,717 --> 01:08:18,093
You can't give in.

875
01:08:18,385 --> 01:08:20,929
You can't give in!

876
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,529
Harvey called.

877
01:08:37,696 --> 01:08:40,740
He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.

878
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,033
I have no choice.

879
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,286
You honestly think that's gonna
keep the Joker from killing people?

880
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:48,915
Maybe not. But I have enough blood
on my hands.

881
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:54,212
And I've seen now what I would
have to become to stop men like him.

882
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,216
You once told me that
if the day came when I was finished...

883
01:08:58,384 --> 01:09:00,468
...that we'd be together.

884
01:09:01,178 --> 01:09:04,347
Bruce, don't make me
your one hope for a normal life.

885
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,225
Did you mean it?

886
01:09:08,727 --> 01:09:10,562
Yes.

887
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:29,622
Bruce.

888
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:34,502
If you turn yourself in,
they're not gonna let us be together.

889
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:48,099
Logs as well?
Everything.

890
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,644
Anything that could lead back
to Lucius or Rachel.

891
01:09:56,984 --> 01:10:00,278
People are dying, Alfred.
What would you have me do?

892
01:10:00,446 --> 01:10:04,199
Endure, Master Wayne. Take it.

893
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:08,077
They'll hate you for it,
but that's the point of Batman.

894
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:13,791
He can be the outcast. He can make
the choice that no one else can make.

895
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,293
The right choice.

896
01:10:15,794 --> 01:10:18,838
No, today I found out
what Batman can't do.

897
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:20,256
He can't endure this.

898
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:23,426
Today you get to say "I told you so."

899
01:10:24,011 --> 01:10:27,180
Today, I don't want to.

900
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,479
But I did bloody tell you.

901
01:10:37,524 --> 01:10:40,526
I suppose they're gonna
lock me up as well...

902
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,570
...as your accomplice.

903
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:47,492
Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
the whole thing was your idea.

904
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:55,291
Ladies and gentlemen, I've called
this press conference for two reasons.

905
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,502
Firstly, to assure the citizens
of Gotham...

906
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,339
...that everything that can be done
over the Joker killings is being done.

907
01:11:02,716 --> 01:11:05,802
Secondly, because the Batman
has offered to turn himself in.

908
01:11:05,970 --> 01:11:07,679
But let's consider the situation.

909
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,682
Should we give in
to this terrorist's demands?

910
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:12,308
Do we really think he's gonna--?

911
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:15,853
You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
than the lives of citizens?

912
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,398
The Batman is an outlaw.

913
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:23,027
That's not why we demand he turn himself
in, we're doing it because we're scared.

914
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:25,989
We've been happy to let Batman
clean up our streets till now.

915
01:11:26,156 --> 01:11:29,117
Things are worse than ever!
Amen.

916
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,370
Yes, they are.

917
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:37,875
But the night is darkest
just before the dawn.

918
01:11:40,337 --> 01:11:42,422
And I promise you...

919
01:11:43,215 --> 01:11:44,632
...the dawn is coming.

920
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:49,345
One day, the Batman will have to answer
for the laws he's broken. But to us...

921
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:51,264
...not to this madman.

922
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,766
-No more dead cops!
Yeah!

923
01:11:57,062 --> 01:11:58,646
He should turn himself in!

924
01:11:58,814 --> 01:12:01,524
Give us the Batman! Come on!
Where is he?

925
01:12:04,403 --> 01:12:06,571
So be it. Take the Batman into custody.

926
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,990
What?
Is he here?

927
01:12:09,742 --> 01:12:10,742
I am the Batman.

928
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:14,078
What?
Come on.

929
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:24,380
Alfred.

930
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:27,508
Why is he letting Harvey do this?

931
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,678
-He went down to the press conference.
-I know. He just stood by.

932
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,930
Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent...

933
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:36,100
...believe that Batman stands for
something more important...

934
01:12:36,268 --> 01:12:38,603
...than the whims of a terrorist,
Miss Dawes...

935
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,772
...even if everyone hates him for it.

936
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,066
That's the sacrifice he's making.

937
01:12:43,233 --> 01:12:46,861
He's not being a hero.
He's being something more.

938
01:12:47,404 --> 01:12:49,030
Yeah, you're absolutely right.

939
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:52,283
Letting Harvey take the fall for this
is not heroic at all.

940
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,579
You know him better than anyone.

941
01:12:56,997 --> 01:12:58,039
I do.

942
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:04,462
Will you give this to him for me?
When the time is right?

943
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:07,131
How will I know?

944
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,800
It's not sealed.

945
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,761
Goodbye, Alfred.

946
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,683
Bye, Rachel.

947
01:13:25,567 --> 01:13:27,443
I didn't have time to talk this through.

948
01:13:27,611 --> 01:13:31,072
-What are you doing?
-They're transferring me to Central Holding.

949
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:35,034
This is the Joker's chance, and when he
attacks, the Batman will take him down.

950
01:13:35,202 --> 01:13:36,744
Listen. This is too dangerous.

951
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:40,623
We get this guy to County, he's their
problem. The streets will be cleared...

952
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:44,502
...so let's go.
The convoys stop for no reason.

953
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,129
I hope you got some moves, pal.

954
01:13:46,296 --> 01:13:50,466
He's using you as bait. He doesn't know
if he can get the Joker. He's failed so far.

955
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:54,846
-How do you know what he's thinking?
-I just do. Anyway, this isn't just about you.

956
01:13:55,013 --> 01:14:00,017
What about the people depending on you to
clean the city up and do it honorably and--?

957
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:08,317
Harvey. Tell everyone the truth.

958
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,570
Heads, I go through with it.

959
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:14,699
This is your life. You can't
leave something like that to chance.

960
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:16,200
I'm not.

961
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,998
You make your own luck.

962
01:14:43,812 --> 01:14:45,813
Hey, you wait like everybody else, pal.

963
01:14:53,447 --> 01:14:55,781
What the hell is that?

964
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:58,159
Obstruction ahead, obstruction ahead!

965
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,537
Damn it! All units divert down
onto Lower Fifth. I repeat, exit down.

966
01:15:01,955 --> 01:15:03,080
Exit down!

967
01:15:03,248 --> 01:15:05,583
Lower Fifth? We'll be
like turkeys on Thanksgiving.

968
01:15:38,283 --> 01:15:40,618
Jesus. Come on, get us out of here.
Let's go.

969
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:45,164
Listen, we need backup.
We've got company.

970
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,874
We got trouble, guys.

971
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,878
Lock and load!

972
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,474
The hell was that?

973
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,999
-These are built for that, right?
-He'll need something...

974
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,959
...a lot bigger to get through this.

975
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,461
What is that?

976
01:16:33,797 --> 01:16:35,131
What is that, a bazooka?

977
01:16:43,765 --> 01:16:45,474
I didn't sign up for this!

978
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,159
Look out.

979
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:05,119
Look out!

980
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,462
Hmm.

981
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:28,517
Come on, let's go!

982
01:18:15,107 --> 01:18:17,316
Harvey, Harvey, Harvey Dent.

983
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:20,319
Oh, excuse me. I wanna drive.

984
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:28,828
Scanning all systems.
Scanning all systems.

985
01:18:36,294 --> 01:18:38,421
We gotta get topside.
We need air support, now!

986
01:18:43,927 --> 01:18:45,803
I like this job. I like it.

987
01:18:48,056 --> 01:18:50,683
Damage catastrophic.
Eject sequence initiated.

988
01:19:04,656 --> 01:19:06,157
Goodbye.

989
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:18,461
We're on point, ready to give them
some of their own medicine.

990
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,303
That's what I'm talking about. Air cav.

991
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,568
Okay, rack them up.

992
01:19:42,736 --> 01:19:45,112
Rack them up, rack them up,
rack them up.

993
01:20:10,847 --> 01:20:12,014
That's not good.

994
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:16,727
Okay, that's not good!

995
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,939
Now, there's a Batman.

996
01:21:06,236 --> 01:21:07,444
Ooh, you wanna play. Come on.

997
01:21:10,365 --> 01:21:11,490
Come on.

998
01:21:20,625 --> 01:21:21,876
He missed!

999
01:21:35,807 --> 01:21:38,225
You can't stop here.
We're like sitting ducks!

1000
01:21:55,243 --> 01:21:56,327
Come on, come on.

1001
01:21:59,456 --> 01:22:02,833
Come on. Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on!

1002
01:22:05,378 --> 01:22:06,837
Come on.

1003
01:22:07,505 --> 01:22:10,841
Come on. I want you to do it,
I want you to do it. Come on, hit me.

1004
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,635
Come on, hit me. Come on, hit me!

1005
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:15,804
Hit me!

1006
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,041
Come on, come on. Aah!

1007
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:46,460
Could you please just give me a minute?

1008
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:50,381
We got you, you son of a bitch.

1009
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:57,596
Gor-- You do like to play things
pretty close to the chest.

1010
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,765
We got him, Harvey.

1011
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:03,394
Mr. Dent! How does it feel
to be the biggest hero in Gotham?

1012
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:06,855
No, I'm no hero.
Gotham's finest, they're the heroes.

1013
01:23:07,023 --> 01:23:10,192
But you and your office have
been working with the Batman all along.

1014
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,195
-No, but I trusted him to do the right thing.
Which was?

1015
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:14,405
Saving my ass.

1016
01:23:14,572 --> 01:23:17,491
All right, people, that's enough.
Let him be. Let him be.

1017
01:23:17,659 --> 01:23:19,576
Thank you, detective.

1018
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,912
I've got a date
with a pretty upset girlfriend.

1019
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,456
-I figured, counselor.
Mr. Dent, sir...

1020
01:23:24,624 --> 01:23:28,752
-...how about one for the front page, sir?
Mr. Dent.

1021
01:23:40,098 --> 01:23:43,267
Stand away! All of you!

1022
01:23:43,435 --> 01:23:46,937
I don't want anything for his Mob lawyer
to use, you understand?

1023
01:23:49,190 --> 01:23:51,066
Back from the dead.

1024
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,277
I, uh...

1025
01:23:53,445 --> 01:23:55,362
...couldn't risk my family's safety.

1026
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:58,490
What do we got?

1027
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:04,121
Nothing. No matches on prints,
DNA, dental.

1028
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:07,041
Clothing is custom, no labels.

1029
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:09,376
Nothing in his pockets
but knives and lint.

1030
01:24:09,544 --> 01:24:11,462
No name.

1031
01:24:11,796 --> 01:24:13,756
-No other alias.
Go home, Gordon.

1032
01:24:13,923 --> 01:24:17,009
The clown'll keep till morning.
Go get some rest.

1033
01:24:17,177 --> 01:24:19,011
You're gonna need it.

1034
01:24:19,262 --> 01:24:21,847
Tomorrow you take the big job.

1035
01:24:22,515 --> 01:24:25,684
You don't have any say in the matter.
Commissioner Gordon.

1036
01:24:41,534 --> 01:24:43,660
I'm sorry, I couldn't risk your safety.

1037
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:51,585
Look at these ugly bastards.

1038
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:53,629
-I don't feel good.
You're a cop killer.

1039
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:56,131
You're lucky to be feeling anything
below the neck.

1040
01:24:56,299 --> 01:24:57,883
-Please!
-Step away from the bars!

1041
01:24:58,051 --> 01:25:00,219
My insides hurt.

1042
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:16,193
Did Batman save you, Daddy?

1043
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,656
Actually, this time...

1044
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:22,991
...I saved him.

1045
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:35,963
Has he said anything yet?

1046
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:47,766
Evening, commissioner.

1047
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,609
Harvey Dent never made it home.

1048
01:25:57,777 --> 01:25:59,903
-Of course not.
-What have you done with him?

1049
01:26:00,822 --> 01:26:02,573
Me?

1050
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:06,326
I was right here.

1051
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:09,580
Who did you leave him with?

1052
01:26:09,747 --> 01:26:12,583
Hm? Your people?

1053
01:26:13,710 --> 01:26:17,045
Assuming, of course,
that they are still your people...

1054
01:26:17,213 --> 01:26:19,923
...and not Maroni's.

1055
01:26:22,135 --> 01:26:24,511
Does it depress you, commissioner...

1056
01:26:24,929 --> 01:26:29,892
...to know just how alone you really are?

1057
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:36,773
Does it make you feel responsible
for Harvey Dent's current predicament?

1058
01:26:36,941 --> 01:26:39,610
-Where is he?
-What's the time?

1059
01:26:40,111 --> 01:26:41,612
What difference does that make?

1060
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:47,326
Well, depending on the time,
he may be in one spot or several.

1061
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:56,668
-If we're gonna play games...
-Mm-hm?

1062
01:26:59,839 --> 01:27:01,798
...I'm gonna need a cup of coffee.

1063
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:06,053
Ah, the "good cop, bad cop" routine?

1064
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:07,763
Not exactly.

1065
01:27:18,274 --> 01:27:22,319
Never start with the head. The victim
gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next--

1066
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:26,615
See?

1067
01:27:26,783 --> 01:27:29,117
You wanted me. Here I am.

1068
01:27:30,161 --> 01:27:32,287
I wanted to see what you'd do.

1069
01:27:32,830 --> 01:27:35,415
And you didn't disappoint.

1070
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,418
You let five people die.

1071
01:27:39,379 --> 01:27:43,048
Then you let Dent take your place.

1072
01:27:43,216 --> 01:27:45,842
-Even to a guy like me, that's cold.
-Where's Dent?

1073
01:27:46,010 --> 01:27:50,806
Those Mob fools want you gone so
they can get back to the way things were.

1074
01:27:51,307 --> 01:27:56,061
But I know the truth. There's no going back.
You've changed things.

1075
01:27:56,229 --> 01:27:58,647
-Forever.
-Then why do you wanna kill me?

1076
01:28:01,609 --> 01:28:03,026
I don't wanna kill you.

1077
01:28:03,528 --> 01:28:08,073
What would I do without you?
Go back to ripping off Mob dealers? No, no.

1078
01:28:08,241 --> 01:28:10,617
No. No, you....

1079
01:28:10,785 --> 01:28:13,203
You complete me.

1080
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:17,708
-You're garbage who kills for money.
-Don't talk like one of them. You're not.

1081
01:28:17,875 --> 01:28:20,294
Even if you'd like to be.

1082
01:28:21,546 --> 01:28:23,380
To them, you're just a freak...

1083
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,632
...like me.

1084
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,093
They need you right now...

1085
01:28:28,678 --> 01:28:30,721
...but when they don't...

1086
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:34,308
...they'll cast you out like a leper.

1087
01:28:34,475 --> 01:28:38,395
You see, their morals, their code...

1088
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,814
...it's a bad joke.

1089
01:28:41,065 --> 01:28:44,401
Dropped at the first sign of trouble.

1090
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:49,072
They're only as good as the world
allows them to be. I'll show you.

1091
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:52,409
When the chips are down, these--

1092
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,828
These civilized people...

1093
01:28:54,996 --> 01:28:57,080
...they'll eat each other.

1094
01:28:57,790 --> 01:29:00,167
See, I'm not a monster.

1095
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:02,836
I'm just ahead of the curve.

1096
01:29:05,089 --> 01:29:06,173
Where's Dent?

1097
01:29:06,341 --> 01:29:09,259
You have all these rules,
and you think they'll save you.

1098
01:29:12,347 --> 01:29:14,765
-He's in control.
-I have one rule.

1099
01:29:14,932 --> 01:29:18,018
Oh. Then that's the rule you'll have to break
to know the truth.

1100
01:29:18,186 --> 01:29:19,353
Which is?

1101
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:21,938
The only sensible way to live
is without rules.

1102
01:29:22,106 --> 01:29:24,775
And tonight you're gonna break
your one rule.

1103
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:25,984
I'm considering it.

1104
01:29:26,152 --> 01:29:28,779
There's only minutes left,
so you'll have to play my game...

1105
01:29:28,946 --> 01:29:31,531
...if you wanna save one of them.

1106
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:33,075
"Them"?

1107
01:29:33,242 --> 01:29:37,287
You know, for a while there,
I thought you really were Dent.

1108
01:29:37,455 --> 01:29:40,082
The way you threw yourself after her.

1109
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:47,464
Look at you go.

1110
01:29:53,096 --> 01:29:56,681
Does Harvey know
about you and his little bunny?

1111
01:29:57,600 --> 01:29:58,975
Where are they?!

1112
01:29:59,143 --> 01:30:01,144
Killing is making a choice.

1113
01:30:01,312 --> 01:30:04,398
-Where are they?!
-Choose between one life or the other.

1114
01:30:05,149 --> 01:30:09,403
Your friend the district attorney,
or his blushing bride-to-be.

1115
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:18,662
You have nothing,
nothing to threaten me with.

1116
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:22,582
Nothing to do with all your strength.

1117
01:30:22,792 --> 01:30:26,211
Don't worry, I'm gonna tell you
where they are, both of them.

1118
01:30:26,379 --> 01:30:29,423
And that's the point.
You'll have to choose.

1119
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:33,009
He's at 250 52nd Street...

1120
01:30:33,177 --> 01:30:36,513
...and she's on Avenue X at Cicero.

1121
01:30:38,599 --> 01:30:40,350
-Which one you going after?
-Rachel.

1122
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:43,186
We're getting Dent!

1123
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,316
250 52nd Street!

1124
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:53,029
Hello?

1125
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,366
Can anybody hear me?

1126
01:30:58,786 --> 01:31:01,413
Hello!

1127
01:31:05,418 --> 01:31:07,669
-Rachel?
-Harvey.

1128
01:31:07,837 --> 01:31:10,046
Oh, Harvey, thank God. Are you okay?

1129
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:11,798
I'm all right. I'm in a--

1130
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:15,552
I'm in a warehouse.
They got me wired to these oil drums.

1131
01:31:16,596 --> 01:31:17,804
I am too.

1132
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:20,056
Harvey.

1133
01:31:27,315 --> 01:31:29,774
I want my phone call.

1134
01:31:29,942 --> 01:31:32,736
I want it. I want it. I want my phone call.

1135
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:35,238
That's nice.

1136
01:31:36,741 --> 01:31:41,578
How many of your friends have I killed?

1137
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:46,416
I'm a 20-year man...

1138
01:31:46,584 --> 01:31:50,045
...and I know the difference between
punks who need a lesson in manners...

1139
01:31:50,213 --> 01:31:53,089
...and the freaks like you
who would just enjoy it.

1140
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:56,426
And you killed six of my friends.

1141
01:31:56,594 --> 01:31:57,594
Six?

1142
01:31:57,762 --> 01:32:00,263
Please. My insides hurt.

1143
01:32:00,431 --> 01:32:02,182
I don't really care. Back away.

1144
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:05,519
The boss said he'd make the voices
go away.

1145
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:09,231
He said he'd go inside
and replace them with bright lights...

1146
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:10,524
...like Christmas.

1147
01:32:10,691 --> 01:32:13,235
You're out of your mind, pal. Back off.

1148
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:16,238
Medic to the holding tank.
Come on. Get the door open.

1149
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:17,614
You guys, back off!

1150
01:32:17,782 --> 01:32:19,950
Listen, we don't have a lot of time.

1151
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:24,120
They told me that only one of us
was gonna make it...

1152
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,624
...and that they were gonna
let our friends choose.

1153
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:32,462
Okay, Rachel.

1154
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:36,174
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be all right.
They're coming for you.

1155
01:32:36,342 --> 01:32:40,637
Listen to me. I'll help you. Just talk me
through what's going on with you.

1156
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:44,307
-Can you find something, anything, sharp?
-I'm trying.

1157
01:32:44,475 --> 01:32:46,643
-What's--?
-Shit.

1158
01:32:46,811 --> 01:32:48,311
Harvey?

1159
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,733
Harvey, what's happening?

1160
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:06,913
All available units,
converge at 250 52nd Street.

1161
01:33:07,248 --> 01:33:11,334
Do you wanna know why I use a knife?

1162
01:33:13,629 --> 01:33:14,963
Guns are too quick.

1163
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:18,508
You can't savor all the...

1164
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:22,012
...little emotions.

1165
01:33:23,931 --> 01:33:28,810
You see, in their last moments...

1166
01:33:28,978 --> 01:33:31,271
...people show you who they really are.

1167
01:33:32,356 --> 01:33:38,028
So in a way, I knew your friends
better than you ever did.

1168
01:33:41,782 --> 01:33:45,201
Would you like to know
which of them were cowards?

1169
01:33:51,709 --> 01:33:53,376
What's that?
Jeez.

1170
01:33:53,586 --> 01:33:55,629
He's got some kind of a...

1171
01:33:55,796 --> 01:33:59,007
-...contusion.
-I know you're gonna enjoy this.

1172
01:34:00,384 --> 01:34:04,137
I'm gonna have to try and enjoy it
even more.

1173
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,644
Whoa, whoa!

1174
01:34:11,687 --> 01:34:12,729
Just put it down.

1175
01:34:12,897 --> 01:34:15,690
Take it easy. Take it easy.
Drop the weapon now!

1176
01:34:15,858 --> 01:34:19,819
-It's my own damn fault, just shoot him!
-Let him go now! Drop it!

1177
01:34:20,112 --> 01:34:23,114
-What? Sorry?
-What do you want?

1178
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:26,076
I just want my phone call.

1179
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,748
What--? What--? What's happening?

1180
01:34:31,916 --> 01:34:34,751
Just talk to me, just for one second.

1181
01:34:37,088 --> 01:34:39,756
-All right?
-Right.

1182
01:34:41,676 --> 01:34:43,093
Ow.

1183
01:34:44,011 --> 01:34:45,595
-Ow.
-Shh, shh, shh.

1184
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,603
Is that a phone?

1185
01:35:03,280 --> 01:35:04,614
Mount the curb!

1186
01:35:12,623 --> 01:35:16,626
Harvey, just in case,
I wanna tell you something, okay?

1187
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:18,586
Don't think like that. They're coming.

1188
01:35:18,754 --> 01:35:21,047
I know they are,
but I don't want them to.

1189
01:35:25,469 --> 01:35:29,556
I don't wanna live without you,
and I do have an answer for you.

1190
01:35:29,974 --> 01:35:31,725
My answer is yes.

1191
01:35:34,478 --> 01:35:37,230
No! No! No!

1192
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:40,024
Not me! Why are you coming for me?

1193
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:41,234
No!

1194
01:35:42,903 --> 01:35:44,487
Rachel! Rachel!

1195
01:35:44,697 --> 01:35:47,031
-Harvey.
-No! No! Rachel!

1196
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:48,241
Okay.

1197
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,492
Rachel!

1198
01:35:49,910 --> 01:35:51,453
No! No!

1199
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:55,749
Harvey, it's okay. It's all right. Listen.

1200
01:35:55,916 --> 01:35:57,250
Somewh--

1201
01:36:03,132 --> 01:36:04,340
No, commissioner!

1202
01:36:04,508 --> 01:36:07,177
Rachel! No!

1203
01:36:21,525 --> 01:36:22,650
Hello there.

1204
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:32,035
Back at the MCU, the Joker's gone.

1205
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:34,662
With Lau?

1206
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:40,043
The Joker planned to be caught.

1207
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:42,545
He wanted me to lock him up
in the MCU.

1208
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:04,234
Dear Bruce:

1209
01:37:05,986 --> 01:37:08,530
I need to be honest and clear.

1210
01:37:10,574 --> 01:37:13,117
I'm going to marry Harvey Dent.

1211
01:37:13,285 --> 01:37:17,205
I love him, and I wanna spend
the rest of my life with him.

1212
01:37:17,748 --> 01:37:22,168
When I told you that if Gotham no longer
needed Batman, we could be together...

1213
01:37:22,336 --> 01:37:24,546
...I meant it.

1214
01:37:24,797 --> 01:37:29,551
But now I'm sure the day won't come
when you no longer need Batman.

1215
01:37:30,594 --> 01:37:32,512
I hope it does.

1216
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:35,431
And if it does, I will be there...

1217
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:37,392
...but as your friend.

1218
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:40,353
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1219
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:42,897
I'm sorry to let you down.

1220
01:37:43,065 --> 01:37:48,069
If you lose your faith in me,
please keep your faith in people.

1221
01:37:48,654 --> 01:37:53,074
Love, now and always, Rachel.

1222
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:03,376
Prepared a little breakfast.

1223
01:38:07,506 --> 01:38:09,424
-Very well, then.
-Alfred.

1224
01:38:09,592 --> 01:38:10,758
Yes, Master Wayne?

1225
01:38:12,136 --> 01:38:14,387
Did I bring this on her?

1226
01:38:15,431 --> 01:38:17,640
I was meant to inspire good...

1227
01:38:17,808 --> 01:38:20,184
...not madness, not death.

1228
01:38:20,352 --> 01:38:24,981
You have inspired good. But you spat
in the faces of Gotham's criminals.

1229
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:27,233
Didn't you think
there might be casualties?

1230
01:38:27,401 --> 01:38:29,819
Things always get worse
before they get better.

1231
01:38:30,154 --> 01:38:31,613
But Rachel, Alfred.

1232
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:35,575
Rachel believed in what you stood for...

1233
01:38:35,743 --> 01:38:37,660
...what we stand for.

1234
01:38:37,828 --> 01:38:39,287
Gotham needs you.

1235
01:38:39,830 --> 01:38:42,790
No, Gotham needs its true hero...

1236
01:38:43,292 --> 01:38:47,420
...and I let that murdering psychopath
blow him half to hell.

1237
01:38:47,588 --> 01:38:49,923
Which is why, for now...

1238
01:38:50,716 --> 01:38:52,634
...they're gonna have to
make do with you.

1239
01:38:54,845 --> 01:38:56,679
She was gonna wait for me, Alfred.

1240
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,725
Dent doesn't know.

1241
01:39:00,893 --> 01:39:02,185
He can never know.

1242
01:39:04,605 --> 01:39:06,230
What's that?

1243
01:39:06,398 --> 01:39:09,359
-It can wait.
-That bandit...

1244
01:39:09,818 --> 01:39:11,945
...in the forest in Burma.

1245
01:39:12,112 --> 01:39:14,155
-Did you catch him?
-Yes.

1246
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:15,657
How?

1247
01:39:17,076 --> 01:39:18,701
We burned the forest down.

1248
01:39:57,908 --> 01:40:00,576
He's credible, an M & A lawyer
from a leading consultancy.

1249
01:40:00,744 --> 01:40:04,122
He says he's waited as long as he can
for Batman to do the right thing.

1250
01:40:04,289 --> 01:40:06,374
Now he's taking matters
into his own hands.

1251
01:40:06,542 --> 01:40:09,502
We'll be live at 5 with
the true identity of the Batman.

1252
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:27,562
I'm sorry about Rachel.

1253
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:35,111
The doctor says you're in agonizing pain,
but that you won't accept medication.

1254
01:40:36,155 --> 01:40:38,114
That you're refusing to...

1255
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:40,033
...accept skin grafts.

1256
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:42,618
Remember that name...

1257
01:40:43,203 --> 01:40:45,538
...you all had for me...

1258
01:40:45,998 --> 01:40:48,833
...when I was at Internal Affairs?

1259
01:40:51,295 --> 01:40:52,587
What was it, Gordon?

1260
01:40:53,255 --> 01:40:54,630
Harvey, I....

1261
01:40:54,798 --> 01:40:56,299
Say it.

1262
01:40:57,718 --> 01:40:59,635
Say it!

1263
01:41:07,311 --> 01:41:10,396
Two-Face. Harvey Two-Face.

1264
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:16,277
Why should I hide who I am?

1265
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:18,821
I know you tried to warn me.

1266
01:41:19,698 --> 01:41:20,907
I'm sorry.

1267
01:41:21,533 --> 01:41:24,160
Wuertz picked you up.
Was he working for them?

1268
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:28,831
Do you know who picked up Rachel?

1269
01:41:29,666 --> 01:41:32,668
Harvey, I need to know
which of my men I can trust.

1270
01:41:33,045 --> 01:41:35,171
Why would you listen to me now?

1271
01:41:36,298 --> 01:41:37,965
I'm sorry, Harvey.

1272
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:42,303
No.

1273
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:44,889
No, you're not.

1274
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:47,183
Not yet.

1275
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:55,149
This craziness, it's too much.

1276
01:41:55,359 --> 01:41:58,611
Should've thought about that
before you let the clown out of the box.

1277
01:41:58,779 --> 01:42:00,530
You want him?

1278
01:42:02,991 --> 01:42:05,368
I can tell you
where he'll be this afternoon.

1279
01:42:13,377 --> 01:42:15,670
Not so crazy as you look.

1280
01:42:15,838 --> 01:42:19,590
I told you, I'm a man of my word.

1281
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:24,053
Where is the Italian?

1282
01:42:24,221 --> 01:42:27,348
All tactical units will converge
on the location in 20 minutes.

1283
01:42:27,516 --> 01:42:30,977
I want auxiliary units to cover
all possible getaway routes.

1284
01:42:31,562 --> 01:42:32,728
Please.

1285
01:42:32,896 --> 01:42:36,232
Joker-man, what you do
with all your money?

1286
01:42:36,900 --> 01:42:39,569
You see, I'm a guy of simple taste.

1287
01:42:39,736 --> 01:42:41,404
I enjoy...

1288
01:42:41,572 --> 01:42:42,947
...dynamite...

1289
01:42:43,115 --> 01:42:44,657
...and gunpowder...

1290
01:42:45,117 --> 01:42:47,535
...and gasoline.

1291
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:51,247
-What the--?
-Ah, ah, ah.

1292
01:42:53,083 --> 01:42:55,918
And you know the thing
that they have in common?

1293
01:42:56,420 --> 01:42:57,712
They're cheap.

1294
01:42:57,880 --> 01:43:00,548
How much are they
paying you to say who Batman is?

1295
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:04,677
This is our chance. I want Lau alive.
The Joker, either way.

1296
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:06,262
Hey, Jim. Get a load of this.

1297
01:43:06,430 --> 01:43:07,763
Let's take the next caller.

1298
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:10,099
Harvey Dent didn't wanna
give in to this maniac.

1299
01:43:10,267 --> 01:43:11,559
You think you know better?

1300
01:43:11,727 --> 01:43:15,104
I think that if we could talk to Dent today,
he may feel differently.

1301
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:19,358
And we wish him a speedy recovery.
Because God knows, we need him now.

1302
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,736
You said you were a man of your word.

1303
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:24,071
Oh, I am.

1304
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:28,451
I'm only burning my half.

1305
01:43:29,786 --> 01:43:31,913
All you care about is money.

1306
01:43:32,080 --> 01:43:35,541
This town deserves
a better class of criminal...

1307
01:43:35,709 --> 01:43:37,960
...and I'm gonna give it to them.

1308
01:43:38,754 --> 01:43:41,255
Tell your men they work for me now.

1309
01:43:41,423 --> 01:43:43,799
This is my city.

1310
01:43:44,468 --> 01:43:47,011
They won't work for a freak.

1311
01:43:47,179 --> 01:43:48,888
"Freak."

1312
01:43:49,056 --> 01:43:51,515
Why don't we cut you up into little pieces...

1313
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:53,142
...and feed you to your pooches? Hm?

1314
01:43:53,310 --> 01:43:56,187
And then we'll see how loyal
a hungry dog really is.

1315
01:43:58,190 --> 01:44:00,524
It's not about money...

1316
01:44:00,692 --> 01:44:03,903
...it's about sending a message.

1317
01:44:04,696 --> 01:44:07,156
Everything burns.

1318
01:44:09,660 --> 01:44:11,827
-Who is this?
I had a vision...

1319
01:44:11,995 --> 01:44:14,747
...of a world without Batman.

1320
01:44:14,915 --> 01:44:17,166
The Mob ground out a little profit...

1321
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:21,254
...and the police tried to shut them down
one block at a time.

1322
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:24,715
And it was so boring.

1323
01:44:24,883 --> 01:44:26,842
I've had a change of heart.

1324
01:44:27,010 --> 01:44:29,637
I don't want Mr. Reese
spoiling everything...

1325
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:34,517
...but why should I have all the fun?
Let's give someone else a chance.

1326
01:44:34,685 --> 01:44:39,522
If Coleman Reese
isn't dead in 60 minutes...

1327
01:44:39,690 --> 01:44:41,774
...then I blow up a hospital.

1328
01:44:41,942 --> 01:44:43,526
Call in every officer.

1329
01:44:43,694 --> 01:44:47,029
Tell them to head to their nearest hospital
and start evac and search.

1330
01:44:47,197 --> 01:44:51,117
Call the transit authority, school board,
prisons. Get every bus down to a hospital.

1331
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:55,871
The priority is Gotham General. Wheel
everybody out of that place right now.

1332
01:44:56,039 --> 01:44:57,707
You, you and you, you come with me.

1333
01:44:57,874 --> 01:44:59,792
-Where are we going, sir?
-To get Reese.

1334
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:03,170
I need you plugged in,
checking Gordon's men and their families.

1335
01:45:03,338 --> 01:45:05,548
-Looking for?
-Hospital admissions.

1336
01:45:05,716 --> 01:45:07,383
Will you be wanting the Batpod?

1337
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,510
In the middle of the day?
Not very subtle.

1338
01:45:09,678 --> 01:45:10,970
The Lamborghini, then.

1339
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:13,014
Much more subtle.

1340
01:45:26,862 --> 01:45:29,363
Excuse me. Let me through.
Excuse me. Okay.

1341
01:45:29,531 --> 01:45:33,034
Sir, could you help, please?

1342
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:34,910
I'm gonna find a bus for him.

1343
01:45:36,872 --> 01:45:38,748
Sir? Commissioner, do you really think...

1344
01:45:38,915 --> 01:45:41,083
...an ordinary citizen
would try to kill this man?

1345
01:45:45,589 --> 01:45:47,923
Sir. Commissioner.

1346
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:52,219
Get the cars around the back!

1347
01:45:54,598 --> 01:45:55,931
Go. Keep rolling, Sam.

1348
01:46:01,897 --> 01:46:03,856
I see O'Brien and Richards.

1349
01:46:04,441 --> 01:46:07,943
No immediate family member
admitted to a Gotham hospital.

1350
01:46:09,237 --> 01:46:12,782
They're trying to kill me.
-Well, maybe Batman can save you.

1351
01:46:25,921 --> 01:46:28,547
Davis, they got space. Bring him out.

1352
01:46:30,217 --> 01:46:32,009
Davis.

1353
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,475
I saw Burns and Zachary.

1354
01:46:39,643 --> 01:46:40,851
Nothing on them.

1355
01:46:41,019 --> 01:46:42,478
And a patrolman I don't know.

1356
01:46:43,688 --> 01:46:45,606
Okay, so, what now?

1357
01:46:46,483 --> 01:46:48,734
What do we do now?
Where are we going?

1358
01:46:51,488 --> 01:46:53,155
Send the information to Gordon.

1359
01:47:00,997 --> 01:47:02,581
Get out of here.

1360
01:47:04,626 --> 01:47:06,419
Davis.

1361
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:12,007
Ma'am, we're gonna have to
move him now.

1362
01:47:23,687 --> 01:47:26,021
It's Berg, isn't it?
-Commissioner.

1363
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:28,607
You okay, son?

1364
01:47:46,626 --> 01:47:48,210
Hi.

1365
01:47:53,049 --> 01:47:54,550
You know...

1366
01:47:55,385 --> 01:47:58,471
....I don't want there to be
any hard feelings between us, Harvey.

1367
01:47:58,638 --> 01:48:01,765
-When you and--
-Rachel!

1368
01:48:01,933 --> 01:48:04,226
--Rachel were being abducted...

1369
01:48:04,394 --> 01:48:07,396
...I was sitting in Gordon's cage.

1370
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:09,648
I didn't rig those charges.

1371
01:48:09,858 --> 01:48:12,318
Your men, your plan.

1372
01:48:12,527 --> 01:48:14,987
Do I really look like a guy with a plan?

1373
01:48:15,405 --> 01:48:18,199
You know what I am?
I'm a dog chasing cars.

1374
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:21,285
I wouldn't know what to do with one
if I caught it.

1375
01:48:21,453 --> 01:48:24,580
You know? I just do things.

1376
01:48:24,956 --> 01:48:28,667
The Mob has plans. The cops have plans.

1377
01:48:28,835 --> 01:48:31,045
Gordon's got plans.

1378
01:48:31,213 --> 01:48:34,173
You know, they're schemers.

1379
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:38,093
Schemers trying to control
their little worlds.

1380
01:48:38,261 --> 01:48:39,762
I'm not a schemer.

1381
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,555
I try to show the schemers...

1382
01:48:41,723 --> 01:48:47,019
...how pathetic their attempts
to control things really are.

1383
01:48:47,979 --> 01:48:51,023
So when I say-- Ah. Come here.

1384
01:48:51,525 --> 01:48:55,069
When I say that you and your girlfriend
was nothing personal...

1385
01:48:56,613 --> 01:48:58,822
...you'll know that I'm telling the truth.

1386
01:49:01,326 --> 01:49:04,119
-I'm gonna need your weapon.
-What?

1387
01:49:07,874 --> 01:49:09,708
Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

1388
01:49:10,418 --> 01:49:11,961
Yeah, that'd be why.

1389
01:49:12,879 --> 01:49:16,090
It's the schemers
that put you where you are.

1390
01:49:16,258 --> 01:49:20,052
You were a schemer, you had plans...

1391
01:49:20,220 --> 01:49:22,388
...and look where that got you.

1392
01:49:33,149 --> 01:49:35,526
Police are taking every precaution...

1393
01:49:35,694 --> 01:49:37,820
...urging people not to
take matters into their hands.

1394
01:49:37,988 --> 01:49:40,531
I just did what I do best.

1395
01:49:40,699 --> 01:49:44,326
I took your little plan
and I turned it on itself.

1396
01:49:44,494 --> 01:49:49,832
Look what I did to this city with
a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets.

1397
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:53,294
Hm? You know what I noticed?

1398
01:49:53,461 --> 01:49:57,006
Nobody panics when
things go "according to plan."

1399
01:49:57,173 --> 01:49:58,841
Even if the plan is horrifying.

1400
01:49:59,467 --> 01:50:04,513
If tomorrow I tell the press that, like,
a gangbanger will get shot...

1401
01:50:04,681 --> 01:50:08,142
...or a truckload of soldiers
will be blowing up...

1402
01:50:08,435 --> 01:50:09,518
...nobody panics.

1403
01:50:10,228 --> 01:50:13,314
Because it's all part of the plan.

1404
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:18,402
But when I say that
one little old mayor will die...

1405
01:50:18,653 --> 01:50:21,071
...well, then, everyone loses their minds.

1406
01:50:24,492 --> 01:50:27,411
Introduce a little anarchy...

1407
01:50:28,580 --> 01:50:30,831
...upset the established order...

1408
01:50:30,999 --> 01:50:35,544
...and everything becomes chaos.

1409
01:50:37,380 --> 01:50:40,132
I'm an agent of chaos.

1410
01:50:40,508 --> 01:50:42,843
Oh, and you know the thing
about chaos?

1411
01:50:44,888 --> 01:50:46,513
It's fair.

1412
01:50:55,732 --> 01:50:58,901
-You live.
-Mm-hm.

1413
01:50:59,402 --> 01:51:01,028
You die.

1414
01:51:01,237 --> 01:51:03,238
Mmm. Now we're talking.

1415
01:51:12,582 --> 01:51:14,083
Mr. Reese.

1416
01:51:32,268 --> 01:51:34,436
That's Mr. Wayne, isn't it?

1417
01:51:34,604 --> 01:51:37,606
-That was a very brave thing you did.
-Trying to catch the light?

1418
01:51:37,941 --> 01:51:40,776
-You weren't protecting the van?
-Why? Who's in it?

1419
01:51:46,241 --> 01:51:48,325
Don't you think
I should go to the hospital?

1420
01:51:48,493 --> 01:51:50,994
Don't watch a whole lot of news,
do you, Mr. Wayne?

1421
01:52:57,145 --> 01:52:58,979
Southeast.

1422
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:01,356
It's Gotham General.

1423
01:53:02,108 --> 01:53:03,776
-Did you clear the building?
Yeah.

1424
01:53:06,780 --> 01:53:10,032
You must know how many
were inside. You have patient lists, roll call.

1425
01:53:10,200 --> 01:53:12,534
Right now we're showing
50 people missing. One bus.

1426
01:53:12,702 --> 01:53:15,871
The other buses were heading off to
hospitals. I guess we missed one.

1427
01:53:16,039 --> 01:53:18,165
What's your guess
about where Harvey Dent is?

1428
01:53:18,333 --> 01:53:22,795
Keep looking. And keep it to yourself.
Anybody asks, we got him out.

1429
01:53:25,381 --> 01:53:27,800
Get me the mayor's office on the line.

1430
01:53:28,968 --> 01:53:30,719
We're gonna need the National Guard.

1431
01:53:30,887 --> 01:53:33,889
--people are still
missing, including GCN's own Mike Engel.

1432
01:53:34,057 --> 01:53:37,309
I'm now being told that we're cutting to
a video GCN has just received.

1433
01:53:37,477 --> 01:53:39,394
I'm Mike Engel for Gotham Tonight.

1434
01:53:39,896 --> 01:53:43,232
"What does it take
to make you people wanna join in?

1435
01:53:43,399 --> 01:53:45,984
You failed to kill the lawyer.
I've gotta get you off the bench...

1436
01:53:46,152 --> 01:53:47,903
-...and into the game.
Bench. Game.

1437
01:53:50,073 --> 01:53:52,199
Come nightfall, this city is mine.
Mine.

1438
01:53:52,367 --> 01:53:55,118
-And anyone left here plays by my rules.
-Rules.

1439
01:53:55,411 --> 01:53:58,747
Mr. Fox? Security is showing
a break-in at the R & D Department.

1440
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,041
If you don't wanna be in the game...

1441
01:54:01,209 --> 01:54:02,584
-...get out now.
-Get out now.

1442
01:54:04,754 --> 01:54:07,714
But the bridge-and-tunnel crowd
are sure in for a surprise.

1443
01:54:08,091 --> 01:54:09,800
Ha-ha, ha-ha."

1444
01:54:43,459 --> 01:54:45,711
Gotham P.D. has shut down...
Sweet Jesus.

1445
01:54:45,879 --> 01:54:47,379
...the area's bridges and tunnels.

1446
01:54:47,547 --> 01:54:50,966
Shouldn't you be out there,
you know, doing something?

1447
01:54:51,134 --> 01:54:53,093
It's my day off.

1448
01:54:53,720 --> 01:54:55,304
I gotta take a leak.

1449
01:54:55,471 --> 01:54:57,806
Keep an eye out for me, will you?

1450
01:55:03,396 --> 01:55:05,355
Now what?
Need someone to shake it for you?

1451
01:55:05,523 --> 01:55:07,107
Hello.

1452
01:55:07,817 --> 01:55:09,318
Dent.

1453
01:55:09,485 --> 01:55:11,695
Jesus. I thought you was dead.

1454
01:55:11,863 --> 01:55:13,530
Half.

1455
01:55:19,579 --> 01:55:21,163
Who picked up Rachel, Wuertz?

1456
01:55:21,331 --> 01:55:23,332
-It must've been Maroni's men.
-Shut up!

1457
01:55:25,084 --> 01:55:29,129
Are you telling me that you're gonna
protect the other traitor in Gordon's unit?

1458
01:55:29,297 --> 01:55:30,756
I don't know, he never told me.

1459
01:55:30,924 --> 01:55:34,551
Listen, Dent, I swear to God, I didn't know
what they were gonna do to you.

1460
01:55:36,095 --> 01:55:37,262
That's funny...

1461
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:41,767
...because I don't know
what's gonna happen to you either.

1462
01:55:45,855 --> 01:55:47,814
Beautiful, isn't it?

1463
01:55:48,191 --> 01:55:49,858
Beautiful.

1464
01:55:50,401 --> 01:55:51,526
Unethical.

1465
01:55:52,695 --> 01:55:54,237
Dangerous.

1466
01:55:54,447 --> 01:55:57,950
You've turned every cell phone in Gotham
into a microphone.

1467
01:55:58,117 --> 01:56:00,535
And a high-frequency generator-receiver.

1468
01:56:00,703 --> 01:56:05,791
You took my sonar concept
and applied it to every phone in the city.

1469
01:56:05,959 --> 01:56:10,545
With half the city feeding you sonar,
you can image all of Gotham.

1470
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:13,840
This is wrong.

1471
01:56:14,008 --> 01:56:16,051
I've gotta find this man, Lucius.

1472
01:56:18,054 --> 01:56:19,346
At what cost?

1473
01:56:19,514 --> 01:56:22,307
The database is null-key encrypted.

1474
01:56:22,475 --> 01:56:24,685
It can only be accessed by one person.

1475
01:56:26,020 --> 01:56:28,188
This is too much power for one person.

1476
01:56:28,356 --> 01:56:30,524
That's why I gave it to you.

1477
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:32,192
Only you can use it.

1478
01:56:32,360 --> 01:56:36,154
Spying on 30 million people
isn't part of my job description.

1479
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:42,077
This is an audio sample. If he talks
within range of any phone in the city...

1480
01:56:42,245 --> 01:56:44,454
...you can triangulate his position.

1481
01:56:44,914 --> 01:56:47,416
I'll help you this one time.

1482
01:56:47,875 --> 01:56:49,668
But consider this my resignation.

1483
01:56:49,836 --> 01:56:54,423
As long as this machine is
at Wayne Enterprises, I won't be.

1484
01:56:55,174 --> 01:56:57,092
When you're finished...

1485
01:56:57,760 --> 01:56:58,885
...type in your name.

1486
01:57:07,478 --> 01:57:10,564
My officers are going over
every inch of the tunnels and bridges...

1487
01:57:10,732 --> 01:57:13,942
...but with the Joker's threat,
they're not an option.

1488
01:57:14,110 --> 01:57:16,945
-And land routes east?
-Backed up for hours.

1489
01:57:17,113 --> 01:57:20,741
Which leaves the ferries
with 30,000 ready to board.

1490
01:57:20,908 --> 01:57:23,952
I wanna use the ferries so I can
get those prisoners off the island.

1491
01:57:24,287 --> 01:57:27,080
The men you put away?
Those aren't people I'm worried about.

1492
01:57:27,248 --> 01:57:29,374
You should be.
Whatever the Joker's planning...

1493
01:57:29,542 --> 01:57:34,046
...it's a good bet Harvey's prisoners are
involved. I wanna get them out of here.

1494
01:57:35,506 --> 01:57:36,715
So where is Harvey?

1495
01:57:37,300 --> 01:57:40,469
-We haven't found him.
-Oh, Jesus.

1496
01:57:44,307 --> 01:57:46,391
How long can you keep this quiet?

1497
01:58:00,490 --> 01:58:03,158
Don't stop for lights, cops, nothing.

1498
01:58:03,993 --> 01:58:06,161
Going to join your wife?

1499
01:58:09,665 --> 01:58:12,167
-You love her?
-Yes.

1500
01:58:13,044 --> 01:58:16,004
You ever imagine what it would be like
to listen to her die?

1501
01:58:16,172 --> 01:58:17,672
Look, take it up with the Joker.

1502
01:58:17,840 --> 01:58:21,093
He killed your woman. He made you...

1503
01:58:21,260 --> 01:58:22,302
...like this.

1504
01:58:22,678 --> 01:58:25,680
The Joker's just a mad dog.

1505
01:58:25,848 --> 01:58:28,475
I want whoever let him off the leash.

1506
01:58:29,185 --> 01:58:32,521
I took care of Wuertz, but who was
your other man inside Gordon's unit?

1507
01:58:32,688 --> 01:58:35,315
Who picked up Rachel?
Must have been someone she trusted.

1508
01:58:36,526 --> 01:58:38,652
Look, if I tell you...

1509
01:58:38,820 --> 01:58:39,861
...will you let me go?

1510
01:58:40,613 --> 01:58:41,947
Can't hurt your chances.

1511
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:46,368
It was Ramirez.

1512
01:58:51,791 --> 01:58:55,043
-But you said--
-I said it couldn't hurt your chances.

1513
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:00,757
You're a lucky man.

1514
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:05,971
-But he's not.
-Who?

1515
01:59:08,891 --> 01:59:10,308
Your driver.

1516
01:59:23,573 --> 01:59:24,573
Stand back.

1517
01:59:24,740 --> 01:59:27,075
Hey, that ain't right.
We should be on that boat.

1518
01:59:27,243 --> 01:59:29,828
You wanna ride across
with them? Be my guest.

1519
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,769
Sir, they've stopped their engines.

1520
01:59:54,937 --> 01:59:55,937
Right, get on the radio.

1521
01:59:56,105 --> 01:59:59,774
Tell them we'll come back and pick them up
once we dump the scumbags.

1522
01:59:59,942 --> 02:00:02,319
Liberty, this is Spirit. Come in.

1523
02:00:04,363 --> 02:00:05,572
What the heck was that?

1524
02:00:07,491 --> 02:00:08,950
What the--?

1525
02:00:09,493 --> 02:00:12,787
Liberty, come in,
please. This is Spirit. Come in.

1526
02:00:14,373 --> 02:00:16,291
Liberty, we have the same thing.
We've lost both engines.

1527
02:00:16,459 --> 02:00:17,959
-Liberty, come in.
Fox.

1528
02:00:18,127 --> 02:00:20,629
There's something going on
on the ferries.

1529
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:23,673
Get down to the engine room now.

1530
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:26,509
Hey, buddy, what's happening?

1531
02:00:35,102 --> 02:00:38,563
Captain, we got a hundred barrels
down there rigged to blow. And this.

1532
02:00:51,661 --> 02:00:52,744
Oh, my God.

1533
02:00:52,912 --> 02:00:54,746
Looks like some kind of detonator.

1534
02:00:54,914 --> 02:00:57,791
Why would they give us
the detonator to our own bomb?

1535
02:01:00,711 --> 02:01:04,005
Tonight, you're all
gonna be a part of a social experiment.

1536
02:01:07,843 --> 02:01:11,680
Through the magic of diesel fuel
and ammonium nitrate...

1537
02:01:11,847 --> 02:01:15,934
...I'm ready right now
to blow you all sky-high.

1538
02:01:16,102 --> 02:01:18,186
Liberty, come in, over.

1539
02:01:19,647 --> 02:01:20,689
It's dead.

1540
02:01:21,023 --> 02:01:25,527
If anyone attempts
to get off their boat, you all die.

1541
02:01:25,861 --> 02:01:27,153
I'm zeroing in.

1542
02:01:27,321 --> 02:01:31,866
Each of you has a remote
to blow up the other boat.

1543
02:01:32,034 --> 02:01:34,494
His voice is on the ferry...

1544
02:01:34,662 --> 02:01:36,705
...but it's not the source.

1545
02:01:38,958 --> 02:01:40,083
West.

1546
02:01:47,341 --> 02:01:49,634
-Gordon.
I have the Joker's location.

1547
02:01:49,802 --> 02:01:50,885
Prewitt Building.

1548
02:01:51,053 --> 02:01:53,513
Assemble on the building opposite.

1549
02:01:54,890 --> 02:01:57,684
At midnight, I blow you all up.

1550
02:01:57,852 --> 02:02:03,023
If, however, one of you presses the button,
I'll let that boat live.

1551
02:02:03,190 --> 02:02:05,317
So who's it gonna be?

1552
02:02:05,484 --> 02:02:08,028
Harvey Dent's most-wanted
scumbag collection...

1553
02:02:08,195 --> 02:02:11,531
...or the sweet and innocent civilians?

1554
02:02:11,699 --> 02:02:14,242
You choose.

1555
02:02:14,410 --> 02:02:16,328
Oh, and you might wanna
decide quickly...

1556
02:02:16,495 --> 02:02:20,832
...because the people on the other boat
may not be quite so noble.

1557
02:02:28,257 --> 02:02:29,257
Stay back.

1558
02:02:29,425 --> 02:02:33,219
Well, now, who are you to decide?
We ought to talk this over, at least.

1559
02:02:33,596 --> 02:02:37,182
We don't all have to die.
Those men had their chance.

1560
02:02:37,808 --> 02:02:41,603
-We are not going to talk about this.
-Why aren't we talking about it?

1561
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:44,356
They're talking over the same thing
on the other boat.

1562
02:02:44,523 --> 02:02:46,816
-Let's put it to a vote.
Yes!

1563
02:02:52,114 --> 02:02:54,699
-Hello?
Barbara, it's Anna Ramirez.

1564
02:02:54,867 --> 02:02:57,911
Jim needs you to pack up
and put the kids in the car right away.

1565
02:02:58,079 --> 02:02:59,788
But the units outside....

1566
02:02:59,955 --> 02:03:01,539
Those cops can't be trusted.

1567
02:03:01,707 --> 02:03:04,667
Jim needs you away from them
as soon as possible.

1568
02:03:04,835 --> 02:03:07,796
I'll call them off for 10 minutes,
and you'll have to move fast.

1569
02:03:07,963 --> 02:03:11,800
-But where am I supposed to take them?
-250 52nd Street.

1570
02:03:11,967 --> 02:03:14,386
-Leave as soon as the patrol car pulls out.
-Okay.

1571
02:03:15,763 --> 02:03:17,555
She believe you?

1572
02:03:17,765 --> 02:03:19,808
It's because she trusts you...

1573
02:03:20,142 --> 02:03:21,226
...just like Rachel did.

1574
02:03:21,394 --> 02:03:23,478
-I didn't know--
-Didn't know what they'd do?

1575
02:03:23,646 --> 02:03:26,398
You're the second cop to say that to me.

1576
02:03:26,649 --> 02:03:28,775
What exactly did you think
they were gonna do?

1577
02:03:28,943 --> 02:03:31,194
They got me early on.
My mother's hospital bills....

1578
02:03:31,362 --> 02:03:34,406
-Don't!
-I'm sorry.

1579
02:03:34,949 --> 02:03:37,409
You live to fight another day, officer.

1580
02:03:41,205 --> 02:03:43,039
We found the missing hospital bus.

1581
02:03:43,207 --> 02:03:44,916
Then we have a hostage situation.

1582
02:03:47,002 --> 02:03:49,003
It's a shooting gallery.

1583
02:03:49,380 --> 02:03:51,673
Why would he choose a spot
with such big windows?

1584
02:03:51,841 --> 02:03:53,675
We have clear shots on five clowns.

1585
02:03:53,843 --> 02:03:56,594
Snipers take them out,
smash the windows, a team rappels in.

1586
02:03:57,012 --> 02:03:58,513
Team moves in by the stairwells.

1587
02:03:58,681 --> 02:04:00,807
Two, three casualties max.

1588
02:04:00,975 --> 02:04:02,851
-Let's do it.
It's not that simple.

1589
02:04:03,018 --> 02:04:05,353
-With the Joker, it never is.
-What's simple is...

1590
02:04:05,521 --> 02:04:08,690
...every second, those people on the ferries
get closer to blowing--

1591
02:04:08,858 --> 02:04:11,401
-That won't happen.
-Then he'll blow both of them up!

1592
02:04:11,569 --> 02:04:15,321
-We don't have time for paper ballots.
-I want everybody to put their votes...

1593
02:04:15,489 --> 02:04:17,490
...on this piece of paper.

1594
02:04:18,534 --> 02:04:21,369
If anyone's got pens, pass it along.

1595
02:04:21,704 --> 02:04:25,498
Thank you. Anybody else?
Coming through. Anybody else? Thank you.

1596
02:04:25,666 --> 02:04:28,543
We need to get these votes in quickly.

1597
02:04:28,711 --> 02:04:30,253
Come on.

1598
02:04:32,256 --> 02:04:34,382
What are you waiting for?
Push the button!

1599
02:04:34,550 --> 02:04:36,509
We're running out of time!

1600
02:04:37,803 --> 02:04:39,637
I need five minutes alone.

1601
02:04:39,805 --> 02:04:41,639
No! There's no time!

1602
02:04:41,807 --> 02:04:43,224
We have clear shots!

1603
02:04:43,392 --> 02:04:46,311
Dent is in there with them.
We have to save Dent!

1604
02:04:46,479 --> 02:04:48,438
I have to save Dent.

1605
02:04:48,606 --> 02:04:49,731
Get ready.

1606
02:04:52,568 --> 02:04:55,236
Two minutes, then we breach.

1607
02:05:00,826 --> 02:05:02,327
Fox, I need picture.

1608
02:05:05,372 --> 02:05:07,832
-Hello?
Jim, we're in trouble.

1609
02:05:09,084 --> 02:05:11,377
Okay, you got POV on alpha...

1610
02:05:12,421 --> 02:05:14,380
...omni on beta.

1611
02:05:15,841 --> 02:05:19,219
Looks like clowns and hostages
on two floors.

1612
02:05:19,386 --> 02:05:21,804
There's a SWAT team on the stairwell.

1613
02:05:25,100 --> 02:05:27,727
Another SWAT team on the roof.

1614
02:05:29,271 --> 02:05:30,480
Line's clear.

1615
02:05:32,233 --> 02:05:34,943
-Barbara, calm down.
-He has the kids!

1616
02:05:35,110 --> 02:05:38,363
Hello, Jim.
-Harvey?

1617
02:05:39,156 --> 02:05:42,367
-Where's my family?
-Where my family died.

1618
02:05:45,454 --> 02:05:47,121
Blue team, acquire the target.

1619
02:05:48,791 --> 02:05:51,376
Entry team, set your charge.

1620
02:06:07,309 --> 02:06:10,812
Fox, the SWATs are targeting the
wrong people. The clowns are the hostages.

1621
02:06:11,522 --> 02:06:13,314
Red team, go! Red team, go!

1622
02:06:17,069 --> 02:06:18,486
Entry team, blow and go!

1623
02:06:22,575 --> 02:06:23,992
Don't move.

1624
02:06:25,160 --> 02:06:26,536
Take the shot.

1625
02:06:32,167 --> 02:06:33,835
Those SWATs are coming in hot.

1626
02:06:34,003 --> 02:06:35,837
Clowns, put down your guns.

1627
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:38,965
Drop your weapons!
On the ground, now!

1628
02:06:39,174 --> 02:06:42,343
Doctors, get down!
Clear the line of fire. Drop your weap--

1629
02:07:06,952 --> 02:07:08,119
Freeze!

1630
02:07:08,287 --> 02:07:10,663
Stand down or you will be--

1631
02:07:14,209 --> 02:07:15,668
Look up.

1632
02:07:16,253 --> 02:07:18,838
See those bad guys on the floor above?

1633
02:07:19,006 --> 02:07:22,008
They're waiting to ambush the SWAT team
coming up the elevator.

1634
02:07:22,468 --> 02:07:23,509
Sixty seconds.

1635
02:07:31,810 --> 02:07:36,397
The tally is 140 against, 396 for.

1636
02:07:44,531 --> 02:07:47,075
So go ahead. Do it.

1637
02:07:47,242 --> 02:07:49,243
We're still here.

1638
02:07:50,412 --> 02:07:53,373
And that means they haven't
killed us yet either.

1639
02:07:54,833 --> 02:07:56,584
Go, go, go!

1640
02:07:56,752 --> 02:07:58,544
Blue team, cover!

1641
02:08:01,507 --> 02:08:02,548
Uh-oh.

1642
02:08:04,051 --> 02:08:05,718
Trouble on the floor above.

1643
02:08:15,062 --> 02:08:16,437
Get down on the ground now!

1644
02:08:24,863 --> 02:08:27,281
Freeze! Stop or we will shoot.

1645
02:08:27,449 --> 02:08:29,450
We will shoot you. Drop the officer.

1646
02:08:29,618 --> 02:08:33,287
-Release the officer right now.
Let him go now! On your knees!

1647
02:08:33,872 --> 02:08:35,957
We got him. He's out of the game.

1648
02:08:36,125 --> 02:08:38,626
Keep your hands in the air!
Step away from the edge!

1649
02:08:46,677 --> 02:08:48,302
Halt!

1650
02:09:01,608 --> 02:09:02,984
Stay down!
Don't move!

1651
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:07,447
Be advised.
Clowns are hostages, doctors are targets.

1652
02:09:13,746 --> 02:09:15,913
Ah, you made it. I'm so thrilled.

1653
02:09:16,081 --> 02:09:19,250
-Where's the detonator?
-Go get him.

1654
02:09:32,639 --> 02:09:35,725
Put down your weapon!
Don't move!

1655
02:10:07,132 --> 02:10:09,008
You don't wanna die...

1656
02:10:09,176 --> 02:10:12,220
...but you don't know how to take a life.

1657
02:10:12,387 --> 02:10:14,055
Give it to me.

1658
02:10:14,348 --> 02:10:18,684
These men will kill you
and take it anyway.

1659
02:10:22,105 --> 02:10:24,607
No one wants to get their hands dirty.

1660
02:10:24,775 --> 02:10:27,735
Fine. I'll do it.

1661
02:10:29,404 --> 02:10:32,114
Those men on that boat?
They made their choices.

1662
02:10:32,282 --> 02:10:34,575
They chose to murder and steal.

1663
02:10:34,743 --> 02:10:37,954
It doesn't make any sense
for us to have to die too.

1664
02:10:47,422 --> 02:10:49,882
All the old familiar places.

1665
02:10:56,181 --> 02:10:57,265
Stand by.

1666
02:11:07,609 --> 02:11:11,195
Red team, floor secure.
Hostages are safe.

1667
02:11:11,405 --> 02:11:13,489
Give it to me.

1668
02:11:14,908 --> 02:11:18,661
You can tell them I took it by force.

1669
02:11:19,162 --> 02:11:24,083
Give it to me, and I'll do what
you should've did 10 minutes ago.

1670
02:11:46,148 --> 02:11:49,483
We really should stop this fighting,
otherwise we'll miss the fireworks.

1671
02:11:49,651 --> 02:11:51,485
There won't be any fireworks.

1672
02:11:51,904 --> 02:11:55,114
And here we go.

1673
02:12:34,446 --> 02:12:36,364
What were you trying to prove?

1674
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:39,492
That deep down,
everyone's as ugly as you?

1675
02:12:40,619 --> 02:12:41,661
You're alone.

1676
02:12:48,251 --> 02:12:53,756
Can't rely on anyone these days.
You gotta do everything yourself. Don't we?

1677
02:12:53,966 --> 02:12:56,801
That's okay. I came prepared.

1678
02:12:57,010 --> 02:13:01,472
It's a funny world we live in. Speaking of
which, you know how I got these scars?

1679
02:13:01,640 --> 02:13:04,475
No, but I know how you got these.

1680
02:13:22,285 --> 02:13:25,037
Oh, you.

1681
02:13:25,205 --> 02:13:28,249
You just couldn't let me go, could you?

1682
02:13:29,376 --> 02:13:33,295
This is what happens
when an unstoppable force...

1683
02:13:33,463 --> 02:13:37,925
...meets an immovable object.

1684
02:13:38,510 --> 02:13:43,931
You truly are incorruptible, aren't you?

1685
02:13:44,099 --> 02:13:46,809
Huh? You won't kill me...

1686
02:13:46,977 --> 02:13:53,232
...out of some misplaced sense
of self-righteousness.

1687
02:13:53,400 --> 02:13:56,610
And I won't kill you...

1688
02:13:56,778 --> 02:14:00,573
...because you're just too much fun.

1689
02:14:01,616 --> 02:14:05,786
I think you and I are destined
to do this forever.

1690
02:14:05,954 --> 02:14:07,955
You'll be in a padded cell forever.

1691
02:14:08,123 --> 02:14:09,957
Maybe we could share one.

1692
02:14:10,125 --> 02:14:14,295
You know, they'll be doubling up, the rate
this city's inhabitants are losing their minds.

1693
02:14:14,463 --> 02:14:17,590
This city just showed you...

1694
02:14:17,758 --> 02:14:21,802
...that it's full of people
ready to believe in good.

1695
02:14:21,970 --> 02:14:25,139
Until their spirit breaks completely.

1696
02:14:26,016 --> 02:14:30,853
Until they get a good look
at the real Harvey Dent...

1697
02:14:31,021 --> 02:14:33,814
...and all the heroic things he's done.

1698
02:14:35,484 --> 02:14:40,529
You didn't think I'd risk losing the battle
for Gotham's soul...

1699
02:14:40,697 --> 02:14:43,616
...in a fistfight with you?

1700
02:14:44,159 --> 02:14:45,701
No.

1701
02:14:45,869 --> 02:14:49,288
You need an ace in the hole.

1702
02:14:49,456 --> 02:14:51,082
Mine's Harvey.

1703
02:14:51,458 --> 02:14:53,167
What did you do?

1704
02:14:53,335 --> 02:14:56,337
I took Gotham's white knight...

1705
02:14:56,505 --> 02:15:00,132
...and I brought him down to our level.

1706
02:15:00,550 --> 02:15:03,511
It wasn't hard.
See, madness, as you know...

1707
02:15:03,678 --> 02:15:06,722
...is like gravity.

1708
02:15:06,890 --> 02:15:09,225
All it takes is a little push.

1709
02:15:26,159 --> 02:15:27,910
Dent!

1710
02:15:48,890 --> 02:15:53,227
This is where they brought her,
Gordon, after your men handed her over.

1711
02:15:53,979 --> 02:15:55,563
This is where she died.

1712
02:15:55,730 --> 02:15:58,065
I know, I was here...

1713
02:15:59,109 --> 02:16:01,861
-...trying to save her.
-But you didn't.

1714
02:16:02,154 --> 02:16:05,573
-I couldn't.
-Yes, you could've. If you'd listened to me.

1715
02:16:05,740 --> 02:16:08,367
If you stood up against corruption...

1716
02:16:08,535 --> 02:16:10,744
...instead of doing your deal
with the devil.

1717
02:16:10,912 --> 02:16:12,538
I was trying to fight the Mob!

1718
02:16:13,039 --> 02:16:17,877
You wouldn't dare try to justify yourself
if you knew what I'd lost.

1719
02:16:19,171 --> 02:16:22,298
Have you ever had to talk to the person
you loved most...

1720
02:16:22,465 --> 02:16:26,343
...tell them it's gonna be all right,
when you know it's not?

1721
02:16:28,013 --> 02:16:31,891
Well, you're about to know
what that feels like, Gordon.

1722
02:16:32,642 --> 02:16:36,520
Then you can look me in the eye
and tell me you're sorry.

1723
02:16:38,273 --> 02:16:41,859
-You're not going to hurt my family.
-No.

1724
02:16:42,027 --> 02:16:44,737
Just the person you love most.

1725
02:16:52,746 --> 02:16:55,789
So is it your wife?

1726
02:16:56,875 --> 02:16:58,542
Put the gun down, Harvey.

1727
02:16:58,919 --> 02:17:00,586
Harvey, put down the gun.

1728
02:17:00,754 --> 02:17:04,298
Please. Please, Harvey. Please.

1729
02:17:05,675 --> 02:17:06,967
Oh, goddamn it.

1730
02:17:07,135 --> 02:17:09,303
Will you stop pointing that gun
at my family?

1731
02:17:09,804 --> 02:17:11,472
No!
-We have a winner.

1732
02:17:11,640 --> 02:17:13,140
No, Jim, stop him!

1733
02:17:13,642 --> 02:17:15,476
Harvey.
Don't let him--

1734
02:17:15,644 --> 02:17:16,769
Harvey!

1735
02:17:18,146 --> 02:17:20,022
I'm sorry!

1736
02:17:21,816 --> 02:17:22,900
For everything.

1737
02:17:25,487 --> 02:17:27,696
Please don't hurt my son.

1738
02:17:37,832 --> 02:17:39,416
You brought your cops?

1739
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:42,461
All they know is there's a situation.

1740
02:17:42,629 --> 02:17:45,631
They don't know who or what.
They're just creating a perimeter.

1741
02:17:45,799 --> 02:17:48,467
You think I wanna escape from this?

1742
02:17:48,635 --> 02:17:51,387
There is no escape from this.

1743
02:17:51,554 --> 02:17:53,681
You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey.

1744
02:17:55,976 --> 02:17:59,186
It's not about what I want,
it's about what's fair!

1745
02:17:59,938 --> 02:18:04,149
You thought we could be decent men
in an indecent time.

1746
02:18:06,945 --> 02:18:08,028
But you were wrong.

1747
02:18:08,738 --> 02:18:12,533
The world is cruel. And the only morality
in a cruel world...

1748
02:18:13,285 --> 02:18:15,202
...is chance.

1749
02:18:15,370 --> 02:18:17,079
Unbiased.

1750
02:18:17,289 --> 02:18:18,539
Unprejudiced.

1751
02:18:19,916 --> 02:18:21,041
Fair.

1752
02:18:21,209 --> 02:18:23,460
His son's got the same chance she had.

1753
02:18:24,212 --> 02:18:25,504
Fifty-fifty.

1754
02:18:25,672 --> 02:18:29,133
What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
We decided to act.

1755
02:18:29,467 --> 02:18:30,801
We three.

1756
02:18:30,969 --> 02:18:34,388
Then why was it me who was
the only one who lost everything?

1757
02:18:36,891 --> 02:18:39,518
-It wasn't.
-The Joker chose me.

1758
02:18:39,686 --> 02:18:41,979
Because you were the best of us.

1759
02:18:42,147 --> 02:18:47,151
He wanted to prove that
even someone as good as you...

1760
02:18:47,319 --> 02:18:49,069
...could fall.

1761
02:18:49,404 --> 02:18:50,696
And he was right.

1762
02:18:50,864 --> 02:18:53,115
You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey.

1763
02:18:53,283 --> 02:18:56,327
So point it at the people responsible.

1764
02:18:57,287 --> 02:18:59,121
Fair enough.

1765
02:19:02,459 --> 02:19:04,335
You first.

1766
02:19:16,848 --> 02:19:18,515
My turn.

1767
02:19:25,440 --> 02:19:27,441
Harvey, you're right.

1768
02:19:28,485 --> 02:19:31,111
Rachel's death was my fault.

1769
02:19:34,199 --> 02:19:36,658
Please don't punish the boy.

1770
02:19:37,744 --> 02:19:40,954
-Please, punish me.
-I'm about to.

1771
02:19:42,916 --> 02:19:44,875
Tell your boy
he's gonna be all right, Gordon.

1772
02:19:45,335 --> 02:19:46,960
Lie...

1773
02:19:47,462 --> 02:19:48,587
...like I lied.

1774
02:19:52,342 --> 02:19:53,926
It's going to be all right, son.

1775
02:20:32,340 --> 02:20:35,175
Dad? Daddy, is he okay?

1776
02:20:51,693 --> 02:20:53,861
-Thank you.
-You don't have to thank me.

1777
02:20:54,487 --> 02:20:56,280
Yes, I do.

1778
02:21:00,535 --> 02:21:01,869
The Joker won.

1779
02:21:04,289 --> 02:21:07,166
Harvey's prosecution,
everything he fought for...

1780
02:21:07,709 --> 02:21:09,460
...undone.

1781
02:21:09,961 --> 02:21:14,882
Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
our city dies with Harvey's reputation.

1782
02:21:15,049 --> 02:21:16,216
We bet it all on him.

1783
02:21:17,552 --> 02:21:20,429
The Joker took the best of us
and tore him down.

1784
02:21:21,014 --> 02:21:22,431
People will lose hope.

1785
02:21:22,599 --> 02:21:24,349
They won't.

1786
02:21:26,853 --> 02:21:28,729
They must never know what he did.

1787
02:21:28,897 --> 02:21:30,731
Five dead.

1788
02:21:31,024 --> 02:21:34,943
-Two of them cops. You can't sweep that--
-No.

1789
02:21:39,741 --> 02:21:42,576
But the Joker cannot win.

1790
02:21:47,832 --> 02:21:51,043
Gotham needs its true hero.

1791
02:21:57,425 --> 02:22:00,469
-No.
-You either die a hero...

1792
02:22:00,637 --> 02:22:05,098
...or you live long enough
to see yourself become the villain.

1793
02:22:05,266 --> 02:22:07,100
I can do those things...

1794
02:22:07,519 --> 02:22:10,562
...because I'm not a hero, not like Dent.

1795
02:22:13,566 --> 02:22:16,443
I killed those people.
That's what I can be.

1796
02:22:16,611 --> 02:22:18,529
No, no, you can't. You're not.

1797
02:22:18,696 --> 02:22:21,281
I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.

1798
02:22:22,951 --> 02:22:24,076
Call it in.

1799
02:22:27,372 --> 02:22:29,122
A hero.

1800
02:22:29,290 --> 02:22:32,543
Not the hero we deserved,
but the hero we needed.

1801
02:22:33,127 --> 02:22:35,671
Nothing less than a knight...

1802
02:22:36,214 --> 02:22:37,923
...shining.

1803
02:22:38,550 --> 02:22:40,175
They'll hunt you.

1804
02:22:40,343 --> 02:22:42,135
You'll hunt me.

1805
02:22:42,637 --> 02:22:44,596
You'll condemn me.

1806
02:22:45,306 --> 02:22:47,599
Set the dogs on me.

1807
02:22:51,354 --> 02:22:53,647
Because that's what needs to happen.

1808
02:22:54,816 --> 02:22:56,733
Because sometimes...

1809
02:22:56,901 --> 02:22:59,069
...the truth isn't good enough.

1810
02:22:59,946 --> 02:23:02,239
Sometimes people deserve more.

1811
02:23:05,702 --> 02:23:09,621
Sometimes people deserve
to have their faith rewarded.

1812
02:23:28,016 --> 02:23:29,683
Batman.

1813
02:23:31,603 --> 02:23:33,353
Batman!

1814
02:23:34,147 --> 02:23:36,106
Why's he running, Dad?

1815
02:23:37,150 --> 02:23:38,483
Because we have to chase him.

1816
02:23:38,651 --> 02:23:41,528
Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!

1817
02:23:47,619 --> 02:23:49,202
He didn't do anything wrong.

1818
02:23:51,956 --> 02:23:57,544
Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,
but not the one it needs right now.

1819
02:23:58,963 --> 02:24:00,005
So we'll hunt him...

1820
02:24:03,134 --> 02:24:05,218
...because he can take it.

1821
02:24:07,722 --> 02:24:10,223
Because he's not a hero.

1822
02:24:17,774 --> 02:24:18,982
He's a silent guardian...

1823
02:24:20,151 --> 02:24:22,027
...a watchful protector.

1824
02:24:24,530 --> 02:24:25,822
A dark knight.

1825
02:32:07,910 --> 02:32:09,911
