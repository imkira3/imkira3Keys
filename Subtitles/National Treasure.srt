2
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,119
Grandpa!

3
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:34,205
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

4
00:01:34,712 --> 00:01:36,835
I just wanted to know.

5
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,462
Well, you're old enough, I suppose.

6
00:01:41,343 --> 00:01:44,131
You should know the story.

7
00:01:45,765 --> 00:01:48,053
OK, here we go.

8
00:01:49,018 --> 00:01:52,102
It was 1832.

9
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:56,397
On a night much like this.

10
00:02:03,324 --> 00:02:09,611
Charles Carroll was the last surviving
signer of the Declaration of Independence.

11
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:14,115
He was also a member
of a secret society known as the Masons.

12
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,664
And he knew he was dying.

13
00:02:18,422 --> 00:02:20,913
He woke up his stable boy
in the middle of the night

14
00:02:21,008 --> 00:02:25,670
and ordered him to take him to
the White House to see Andrew Jackson,

15
00:02:25,763 --> 00:02:28,930
because it was urgent
that he speak to the president.

16
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:31,470
Did he talk to him?

17
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:34,764
No. He never got the chance.

18
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:37,221
The president wasn't there that night.

19
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:41,848
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

20
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,187
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

21
00:02:46,277 --> 00:02:49,231
my grandfather's grandfather,

22
00:02:49,989 --> 00:02:51,816
Thomas Gates.

23
00:02:51,908 --> 00:02:54,114
What was the secret?

24
00:02:56,955 --> 00:02:57,951
A treasure.

25
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,203
A treasure beyond all imagining.

26
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:10,423
A treasure that had been
fought over for centuries

27
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:14,923
by tyrants, pharaohs,
emperors, warlords.

28
00:03:15,223 --> 00:03:18,722
And every time it changed hands
it grew larger.

29
00:03:21,688 --> 00:03:24,261
And then suddenly...

30
00:03:24,607 --> 00:03:26,683
it vanished.

31
00:03:28,528 --> 00:03:31,648
It didn't reappear
for more than a thousand years,

32
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,566
when knights from the First Crusade

33
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:37,110
discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.

34
00:03:37,203 --> 00:03:39,694
You see, the knights who found the vaults

35
00:03:39,789 --> 00:03:44,167
believed that the treasure
was too great for any one man -

36
00:03:44,252 --> 00:03:46,245
not even a king.

37
00:03:46,337 --> 00:03:52,672
They brought the treasure back to Europe
and took the name "the Knights Templar".

38
00:03:55,138 --> 00:03:58,222
Over the next century
they smuggled it out of Europe

39
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:01,225
and they formed a new brotherhood
called the Freemasons,

40
00:04:01,311 --> 00:04:04,098
in honour of
the builders of the great temple.

41
00:04:05,482 --> 00:04:06,940
War followed.

42
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:10,969
By the time of the American Revolution
the treasure had been hidden again.

43
00:04:11,065 --> 00:04:13,223
By then the Masons included

44
00:04:13,317 --> 00:04:17,445
George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere.

45
00:04:18,447 --> 00:04:20,274
They knew they had to make sure

46
00:04:20,366 --> 00:04:23,781
the treasure would never fall
into the hands of the British.

47
00:04:23,869 --> 00:04:27,997
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

48
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,869
Over time the clues were lost or forgotten,

49
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:33,118
until only one remained -

50
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:39,215
and that was the secret that Charles Carroll
entrusted to young Thomas Gates.

51
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:46,338
Charlotte.

52
00:04:47,184 --> 00:04:50,635
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

53
00:04:51,355 --> 00:04:53,146
Who's Charlotte?

54
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:56,897
Oh, not even Mr Carroll knew that.

55
00:04:56,985 --> 00:04:58,777
Now look here, Ben.

56
00:04:58,862 --> 00:05:03,275
The Freemasons
among our Founding Fathers left us clues.

57
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:04,861
Like these.

58
00:05:04,952 --> 00:05:08,237
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

59
00:05:08,747 --> 00:05:12,994
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

60
00:05:13,752 --> 00:05:18,877
- They're speaking to us through these.
- You mean laughing at us.

61
00:05:18,966 --> 00:05:21,753
You know what that dollar represents?

62
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,417
The entire Gates family fortune.

63
00:05:24,513 --> 00:05:28,890
Six generations of fools...
chasing after fool's gold.

64
00:05:28,976 --> 00:05:32,392
It's not about the money, Patrick.
It's never been about the money.

65
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,638
Come on, son. Time to go.

66
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:38,061
You can... say your goodbyes.

67
00:05:45,534 --> 00:05:47,159
Grandpa?

68
00:05:50,324 --> 00:05:52,032
Are we knights?

69
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,487
Do you want to be?

70
00:05:57,582 --> 00:06:00,998
All right. Um... kneel.

71
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,554
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

72
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:20,264
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

73
00:06:20,355 --> 00:06:23,272
and the family Gates.

74
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:26,064
Do you so swear?

75
00:06:26,152 --> 00:06:28,145
I so swear.

76
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:53,085
I was thinking about
Henson and Peary,

77
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:57,758
crossing this kind of terrain with nothing
more than dog sleds and on foot.

78
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,520
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

79
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,525
We getting closer?

80
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:12,609
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

81
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:15,403
we should be getting very close.

82
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:19,111
But don't go by me -
I broke a shoelace this morning.

83
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:26,040
- It's... it's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

84
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:29,295
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

85
00:07:31,169 --> 00:07:32,367
OK.

86
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:36,080
Riley, you're not missing that little
windowless cubicle we found you in?

87
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,297
No, no. Absolutely not.

88
00:07:56,403 --> 00:07:59,238
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

89
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:03,367
- I don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

90
00:08:13,628 --> 00:08:17,080
Look... this is a waste of time.

91
00:08:17,174 --> 00:08:20,175
How could a ship wind up way out here?

92
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,427
Well, I'm no expert, but...

93
00:08:23,513 --> 00:08:26,598
it could be that the hydrothermic properties
of this region

94
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:29,257
produce hurricane-force ice storms

95
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:33,433
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze,

96
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:38,150
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

97
00:08:38,236 --> 00:08:41,937
that would land a ship right around here.

98
00:09:30,908 --> 00:09:32,735
Hello, beautiful.

99
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,376
Have Viktor
check the fuel in the generators.

100
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:49,714
Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real,

101
00:09:49,802 --> 00:09:52,127
I don't know
if I ever would have found Charlotte.

102
00:09:52,221 --> 00:09:54,973
You would have found it, I have no doubt.

103
00:09:55,057 --> 00:09:59,435
That's why I didn't think it was
as crazy an investment as everyone said.

104
00:09:59,812 --> 00:10:04,023
I'm just relieved that I'm not as crazy
as everyone says. Or said my dad was.

105
00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:07,526
Or my granddad. Or my great-granddad.

106
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:10,988
OK!

107
00:10:11,073 --> 00:10:13,113
Let's go!

108
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:17,907
- Let's go find some treasure.
- Yeah, bring us back something.

109
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:58,944
Oh, God!

110
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:03,695
You handled that well.

111
00:11:04,788 --> 00:11:07,195
This is it.

112
00:11:07,624 --> 00:11:09,533
It's the cargo hold.

113
00:11:21,888 --> 00:11:24,640
Do you think it's in the barrels?

114
00:11:43,493 --> 00:11:45,071
Gunpowder.

115
00:11:48,331 --> 00:11:49,909
OK...

116
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:57,753
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

117
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:24,858
I found something!

118
00:12:31,452 --> 00:12:33,444
What is it?

119
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:53,136
Do you guys know what this is?

120
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,929
Is it a billion-dollar pipe?

121
00:12:57,728 --> 00:13:01,144
It's a meerschaum pipe.
Ah, that is beautiful.

122
00:13:01,231 --> 00:13:04,647
Look at the intricacy of the scrollwork
on the stem.

123
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:08,898
- Is it a million-dollar pipe?
- No, it's a clue.

124
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,741
Let me see that.

125
00:13:12,743 --> 00:13:14,949
No, don't break it!

126
00:13:15,037 --> 00:13:17,658
We are one step closer to the treasure,
gentlemen.

127
00:13:17,748 --> 00:13:20,321
Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the Charlotte.

128
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:22,955
No, "The secret lies with Charlotte."

129
00:13:23,045 --> 00:13:25,121
I said it could be here.

130
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,650
It's Templar symbols.

131
00:13:51,115 --> 00:13:53,154
"The legend writ."

132
00:13:53,242 --> 00:13:55,365
"The stain effected."

133
00:13:55,452 --> 00:13:58,489
"The key in Silence undetected."

134
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:02,082
"Fifty-five in iron pen."

135
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:05,541
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

136
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,327
It's a riddle.

137
00:14:14,507 --> 00:14:16,215
I need to think.

138
00:14:19,762 --> 00:14:21,755
"The legend writ."

139
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:23,805
"The stain effected."

140
00:14:24,726 --> 00:14:26,718
What legend?

141
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:32,022
There's the legend of the Templar treasure,
and the stain effects the legend.

142
00:14:32,108 --> 00:14:34,184
How?

143
00:14:34,277 --> 00:14:36,684
"The key in Silence undetected."

144
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:39,690
Wait.

145
00:14:40,575 --> 00:14:44,619
The legend and the key...
Now there's something.

146
00:14:44,704 --> 00:14:46,163
A map.

147
00:14:46,247 --> 00:14:49,034
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

148
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,283
It's a map, an invisible map.
So now...

149
00:14:51,377 --> 00:14:55,042
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible" - "an invisible map"?

150
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:59,425
"The stain effected"
could refer to a dye or a reagent

151
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:02,048
used to bring about a certain result.

152
00:15:02,138 --> 00:15:04,973
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected",

153
00:15:05,058 --> 00:15:10,099
the implication is that the effect is to make
what was undetectable detectable.

154
00:15:10,813 --> 00:15:15,025
Unless...
"The key in Silence" could be...

155
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:17,600
Prison.

156
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:20,154
Albuquerque.

157
00:15:20,239 --> 00:15:22,813
See, I can do it too.
Snorkel.

158
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:25,660
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen."

159
00:15:25,745 --> 00:15:27,204
"Iron pen" is a prison.

160
00:15:27,288 --> 00:15:32,709
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

161
00:15:32,794 --> 00:15:35,711
the "pen" is... just a pen.

162
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:40,209
But then why not say a pen?
Why... why say "iron pen"?

163
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:43,091
Cos it's a prison.

164
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:47,307
Wait a minute. "Iron pen" - the "iron"
does not describe the ink in the pen,

165
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:51,013
it describes what was penned.

166
00:15:51,098 --> 00:15:54,348
It was "iron" -
it was firm, it was mineral...

167
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:56,094
No, no, no, that's stupid.

168
00:15:56,186 --> 00:16:01,607
It was... It was firm,
it was adamant, it was resolved.

169
00:16:03,402 --> 00:16:05,394
It was resolved.

170
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,153
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

171
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,905
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

172
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:16,287
Calligrapher, not writer. And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

173
00:16:16,373 --> 00:16:20,157
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

174
00:16:20,252 --> 00:16:24,166
a resolution that 55 men signed.

175
00:16:26,925 --> 00:16:29,760
The Declaration of Independence.

176
00:16:36,435 --> 00:16:40,847
Come on, there's no invisible map on the
back of the Declaration of Independence.

177
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:43,395
That's clever, really.
A document of that importance

178
00:16:43,483 --> 00:16:45,725
would ensure the map's survival.

179
00:16:45,819 --> 00:16:48,571
And you said there were several Masons
signed it, yeah?

180
00:16:48,655 --> 00:16:51,941
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

181
00:16:53,285 --> 00:16:56,820
We'll have to arrange a way to examine it.

182
00:16:56,913 --> 00:17:00,080
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

183
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:04,544
They're not just gonna let us waltz in there
and run chemical tests on it.

184
00:17:04,629 --> 00:17:07,167
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

185
00:17:11,011 --> 00:17:13,217
We could borrow it.

186
00:17:14,181 --> 00:17:16,173
Steal it?

187
00:17:17,601 --> 00:17:20,471
- I don't think so.
- Ben...

188
00:17:20,562 --> 00:17:24,013
the treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

189
00:17:24,107 --> 00:17:26,812
Oh, I didn't know that.
Really?

190
00:17:27,653 --> 00:17:32,024
Look, Ben... I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

191
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,436
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

192
00:17:34,528 --> 00:17:36,735
only to have
the respected historical community

193
00:17:36,822 --> 00:17:40,654
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

194
00:17:40,743 --> 00:17:43,234
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

195
00:17:43,329 --> 00:17:45,998
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

196
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,577
How?

197
00:17:48,959 --> 00:17:51,747
We all have our areas of expertise.

198
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,373
You don't think mine are limited
to writing cheques, do you?

199
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:58,673
In another life...

200
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:05,259
I arranged a number of operations of...
questionable legality.

201
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:10,226
I'd take his word for it, if I were you.

202
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:16,403
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

203
00:18:18,114 --> 00:18:19,193
No.

204
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,575
I'd really need your help here.

205
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:33,205
Lan... I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

206
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:35,502
OK.

207
00:18:35,589 --> 00:18:38,923
From this point on
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

208
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:42,503
Hey!

209
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:46,546
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

210
00:18:47,184 --> 00:18:49,936
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

211
00:18:50,021 --> 00:18:53,271
Information you don't have. I do.

212
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:56,394
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

213
00:18:56,485 --> 00:18:58,811
He's bluffing.

214
00:18:58,904 --> 00:19:01,574
We played poker together, lan.
You know I can't bluff.

215
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:03,982
Tell me what I need to know, Ben,

216
00:19:04,076 --> 00:19:06,365
or I'll shoot your friend.

217
00:19:06,454 --> 00:19:07,864
Hey!

218
00:19:07,955 --> 00:19:10,274
Quiet, Riley!
Your job's finished here.

219
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:19,168
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

220
00:19:19,252 --> 00:19:23,084
You shoot me,
I drop this, we all go up.

221
00:19:24,507 --> 00:19:25,836
Ben...

222
00:19:27,135 --> 00:19:30,255
What happens when the flare burns down?

223
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:34,469
Tell me what I need to know, Ben.

224
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:38,102
You need to know...

225
00:19:38,188 --> 00:19:40,145
if Shaw can catch.

226
00:19:46,029 --> 00:19:47,689
Nice try, though.

227
00:19:59,042 --> 00:20:01,035
Get out, Shaw!

228
00:20:09,678 --> 00:20:11,338
Fool!

229
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:17,517
Riley, get over here!

230
00:20:22,983 --> 00:20:25,520
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

231
00:20:31,074 --> 00:20:32,485
Move! Get out of here!

232
00:20:32,575 --> 00:20:34,200
- What?
- Move! Get out!

233
00:20:35,412 --> 00:20:37,404
Follow me.

234
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,869
Let's go, let's go!
She's gonna blow!

235
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,127
Get down.

236
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:26,613
OK, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

237
00:21:57,321 --> 00:22:00,357
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

238
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:04,494
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

239
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:13,034
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

240
00:22:13,128 --> 00:22:17,458
No, I meant about lan. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

241
00:22:18,717 --> 00:22:20,342
We stop him.

242
00:22:38,481 --> 00:22:39,761
Is it really so hard to believe

243
00:22:39,857 --> 00:22:42,313
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

244
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:44,857
The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.

245
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,318
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

246
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:49,945
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

247
00:22:50,034 --> 00:22:53,154
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

248
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:58,038
We don't need someone crazy. But one
step short of crazy, what do you get?

249
00:22:58,126 --> 00:22:59,786
Obsessed.

250
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,537
Passionate.

251
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:11,670
Excuse me.

252
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:18,884
- Dr Chase can see you now, Mr Brown.
- Thank you.

253
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,260
Mr Brown?

254
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:23,690
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

255
00:23:23,776 --> 00:23:25,852
Huh. Being kept down by the man.

256
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,190
A very cute man.

257
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:32,572
Thank you.

258
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,867
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

259
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,578
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

260
00:23:37,665 --> 00:23:40,037
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

261
00:23:40,501 --> 00:23:42,624
Nice to meet you, Bill.

262
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,962
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

263
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:48,172
Saxony German.

264
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,887
- You're not American?
- Oh, I am an American.

265
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:55,008
I just wasn't born here.
Please don't touch that!

266
00:23:55,099 --> 00:23:58,682
Sorry. A neat collection.
George Washington's campaign buttons.

267
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,391
You're missing the 1789 inaugural, though.

268
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:04,482
- I found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

269
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,521
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

270
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,735
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:12,568
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

272
00:24:14,237 --> 00:24:17,523
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

273
00:24:20,077 --> 00:24:22,200
It's true.

274
00:24:23,789 --> 00:24:25,912
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

275
00:24:25,999 --> 00:24:27,873
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

276
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,329
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

277
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,995
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

278
00:24:34,091 --> 00:24:38,040
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document...

279
00:24:38,845 --> 00:24:42,795
we would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

280
00:24:42,891 --> 00:24:44,931
What do you think you're gonna find?

281
00:24:45,018 --> 00:24:51,520
We believe that there's an...
encryption on the back.

282
00:24:52,025 --> 00:24:54,896
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.

283
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:56,979
Of what?

284
00:24:57,072 --> 00:25:00,073
A... cartograph.

285
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:02,400
- A map.
- Yes, ma'am.

286
00:25:02,911 --> 00:25:05,663
A map of what?

287
00:25:05,747 --> 00:25:07,740
The location of...

288
00:25:08,417 --> 00:25:16,329
...of hidden items
of historic and intrinsic value.

289
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:21,425
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

290
00:25:21,513 --> 00:25:24,431
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

291
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:26,841
We're more like treasure-protectors.

292
00:25:27,477 --> 00:25:32,020
Mr Brown, I have personally seen the back
of the Declaration of Independence,

293
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:36,401
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads,

294
00:25:36,486 --> 00:25:38,444
"Original Declaration of Independence,
dated...

295
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:41,365
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

296
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:43,276
But no map.

297
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,742
It's invisible.

298
00:25:58,836 --> 00:26:00,627
Oh! Right.

299
00:26:00,963 --> 00:26:05,091
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

300
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:08,379
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

301
00:26:08,804 --> 00:26:11,805
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

302
00:26:11,891 --> 00:26:14,298
Owned by Freemasons.

303
00:26:14,393 --> 00:26:18,687
- May I see the pipe?
- We don't have it.

304
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:24,184
- Did Big Foot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

305
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,855
Nice to meet you, too.

306
00:26:27,573 --> 00:26:29,945
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

307
00:26:30,034 --> 00:26:33,367
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

308
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,703
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

309
00:26:40,795 --> 00:26:43,250
It's not.

310
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:47,123
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

311
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:51,595
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

312
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:55,513
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare lan away.

313
00:26:56,686 --> 00:27:00,137
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

314
00:27:00,231 --> 00:27:02,804
Of all the words
written here about freedom,

315
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,565
there's a line here
that's at the heart of all the others.

316
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:10,153
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

317
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:12,910
pursuing invariably the same object,

318
00:27:12,994 --> 00:27:16,943
evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism,

319
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,954
it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

320
00:27:21,043 --> 00:27:24,543
and provide new guards
for their future security."

321
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,582
People don't talk that way any more.

322
00:27:28,676 --> 00:27:30,709
Beautiful, huh?

323
00:27:32,257 --> 00:27:35,293
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

324
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:39,714
those who have the ability to take action
have the responsibility to take action.

325
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,727
I'm gonna steal it.

326
00:27:50,025 --> 00:27:51,768
What?

327
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,110
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

328
00:28:00,327 --> 00:28:02,070
Ben?

329
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:05,404
This is... huge.

330
00:28:05,999 --> 00:28:08,620
It's prison huge.

331
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:11,035
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

332
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:13,537
Yeah, probably.

333
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,169
So that would bother most people.

334
00:28:16,801 --> 00:28:21,510
Lan's gonna try and steal it. And if he
succeeds, he'll destroy the Declaration.

335
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:24,967
The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.

336
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,633
It's upside down.

337
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:31,430
I don't think there's a choice.

338
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:34,647
Ben, for God's sakes,

339
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:38,354
it's like stealing a national monument. OK?

340
00:28:38,448 --> 00:28:40,606
It's like stealing him.

341
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:45,446
It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.

342
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:49,245
Let me prove it to you.

343
00:28:49,334 --> 00:28:52,003
OK, Ben, pay attention.

344
00:28:52,087 --> 00:28:54,957
I've brought you to the Library of Congress.

345
00:28:55,048 --> 00:28:58,666
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

346
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,918
Over 20 million books.

347
00:29:01,012 --> 00:29:03,468
And they're all saying
the same exact thing:

348
00:29:03,556 --> 00:29:05,882
Listen to Riley.

349
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:10,715
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

350
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:13,263
Short of builders' blueprints.

351
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:17,397
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

352
00:29:18,274 --> 00:29:21,109
water and sewage -
it's all here.

353
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:24,277
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, OK,

354
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:27,946
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

355
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:31,983
and a little family from lowa and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.

356
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:36,824
And beneath an inch of bulletproof glass
is an army of sensors and heat monitors

357
00:29:36,917 --> 00:29:40,251
that will go off if someone gets too close
with a high fever.

358
00:29:41,088 --> 00:29:43,709
Now, when it's not on display,

359
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:51,846
it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...

360
00:29:52,516 --> 00:29:56,977
that happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

361
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:59,102
and biometric access-denial systems.

362
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:02,938
You know, Thomas Edison tried and failed
nearly 2,000 times

363
00:30:03,027 --> 00:30:06,941
to develop the carbonised cotton-thread
filament for the incandescent light bulb.

364
00:30:07,031 --> 00:30:08,406
Edison?

365
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,566
When asked about it,
he said, "I didn't fail,

366
00:30:10,659 --> 00:30:13,446
I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb."

367
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:16,906
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

368
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,251
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

369
00:30:24,173 --> 00:30:26,960
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

370
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:29,542
Delicious jams and jellies?

371
00:30:29,637 --> 00:30:32,306
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

372
00:30:32,389 --> 00:30:34,216
all the documents
and the storage housings

373
00:30:34,308 --> 00:30:36,514
when they're not on display or in the vault.

374
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:40,896
Now, when the case needs work they take
it out of the vault, directly across the hall

375
00:30:40,981 --> 00:30:42,773
and into the Preservation Room.

376
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:46,772
The best time for us, or lan, to steal it
would be during the gala this weekend

377
00:30:46,862 --> 00:30:49,976
when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.

378
00:30:50,068 --> 00:30:56,153
But we'll make our way to the Preservation
Room, where there's much less security.

379
00:30:59,035 --> 00:31:01,407
Well, if lan...

380
00:31:03,581 --> 00:31:05,704
Preservation...

381
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,290
The gala, huh?

382
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:12,663
This might be possible.

383
00:31:13,424 --> 00:31:15,216
It might.

384
00:31:49,043 --> 00:31:51,415
And we are in.

385
00:32:03,266 --> 00:32:06,101
There you are. Hello.

386
00:32:10,148 --> 00:32:12,140
The hallway.

387
00:32:18,406 --> 00:32:20,066
That's what I want.

388
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:35,741
Game on.

389
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:11,487
I'll buy that.

390
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,202
Cool.

391
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:52,364
This just came for you.

392
00:33:52,995 --> 00:33:55,486
I hope it's not from Stan.

393
00:33:57,583 --> 00:34:02,209
"For the woman who has everything else...
Thanks for listening. Paul Brown."

394
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,542
Abigail Chase.

395
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,723
Hey, Mike.

396
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,610
- Let's do this by the book.
- Hallway is secure.

397
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,065
- Keep the document level.
- No problem.

398
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:16,859
What have you got?

399
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,905
The heat sensor went off
in the Declaration frame.

400
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:22,574
Run full diagnostics,
then I want them all changed out.

401
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:25,331
Our evil plan is working.

402
00:36:05,031 --> 00:36:07,071
Ben, are you sure that we should...?

403
00:36:10,537 --> 00:36:11,865
Riley.

404
00:36:12,414 --> 00:36:14,786
- Can you hear me?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

405
00:36:14,874 --> 00:36:16,582
We're all set in here.

406
00:36:16,668 --> 00:36:19,954
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

407
00:36:20,046 --> 00:36:22,881
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead, man.

408
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:29,301
Howdy.

409
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:37,350
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

410
00:36:55,582 --> 00:36:57,824
How do you look?

411
00:36:57,918 --> 00:37:01,002
- Not bad.
- Mazel tov.

412
00:37:08,303 --> 00:37:10,342
This is it.

413
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,578
For you.

414
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:48,040
- Oh, Mr Brown.
- Dr Chase.

415
00:37:48,128 --> 00:37:51,497
- What are you doing here?
- Is that that hot girl?

416
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:56,667
- How does she look?
- I made a last-minute donation. A big one.

417
00:37:56,762 --> 00:37:59,431
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

418
00:37:59,515 --> 00:38:02,469
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

419
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:06,688
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but...

420
00:38:06,772 --> 00:38:08,765
I really want it.

421
00:38:08,857 --> 00:38:12,108
- Well, you needed it.
- Come on, Romeo, get outta there.

422
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:16,192
I have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

423
00:38:16,282 --> 00:38:18,025
on the pipe that Big Foot took.

424
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:19,528
Hi.

425
00:38:19,952 --> 00:38:24,246
- Here you go.
- Oh, Dr Herbert, this is Mr Brown.

426
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:25,446
- Hi.
- Hi there.

427
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:29,040
- Who's the stiff?
- Here, why don't you let me take that?

428
00:38:29,128 --> 00:38:32,710
- So you can take that off his hands.
- Thank you.

429
00:38:33,799 --> 00:38:35,957
A toast, yeah?

430
00:38:36,051 --> 00:38:38,174
To high treason.

431
00:38:38,262 --> 00:38:41,631
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

432
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:46,966
Had we lost the war, they would have been
hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered,

433
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:51,523
and - Oh! Oh, my personal favourite -
and had their entrails cut out and burned!

434
00:38:53,736 --> 00:38:58,694
So, here's to the men
who did what was considered wrong

435
00:38:58,782 --> 00:39:01,902
in order to do what they knew was right.

436
00:39:03,203 --> 00:39:05,030
What they knew was right.

437
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,418
Well, good night.

438
00:39:18,504 --> 00:39:20,711
- Good night.
- Good night.

439
00:39:36,814 --> 00:39:39,187
Yeah!

440
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:42,017
OK, go! Go!

441
00:39:54,832 --> 00:39:56,540
This better work.

442
00:40:02,924 --> 00:40:03,624
Clear!

443
00:40:09,097 --> 00:40:12,596
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

444
00:40:21,442 --> 00:40:23,482
How does it look?

445
00:40:25,572 --> 00:40:28,857
It's working.
It's working...

446
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,325
Unbelievable.

447
00:40:51,425 --> 00:40:53,298
Second door. 90 seconds.

448
00:41:06,231 --> 00:41:08,901
Well done, boys. Let's go.

449
00:41:21,955 --> 00:41:24,446
- We're in the elevator.
- OK.

450
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:26,748
I'm gonna turn off
the surveillance cameras. Ready?

451
00:41:27,377 --> 00:41:29,785
In five, four,

452
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,038
three... Now.

453
00:41:33,884 --> 00:41:35,164
Ben Gates,

454
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:37,930
you are now the Invisible Man.

455
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,847
- I'm here.
- Give me the letters for her password.

456
00:41:45,938 --> 00:41:48,096
What do you got for me?

457
00:41:50,817 --> 00:41:52,525
Hit me with it.

458
00:41:52,611 --> 00:41:54,568
A-E-F-G...

459
00:41:54,655 --> 00:41:57,656
L-O-R-V-Y.

460
00:41:58,116 --> 00:42:01,117
Anagrams being listed.

461
00:42:01,203 --> 00:42:03,242
OK.

462
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:05,999
Top results: "A glove fry."

463
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,625
"A very golf."

464
00:42:07,709 --> 00:42:09,583
"Fargo levy."

465
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:11,911
"Gravy floe. Valey frog."

466
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:14,923
Also "Ago fly rev."

467
00:42:15,759 --> 00:42:17,337
"Grove fly a."

468
00:42:17,427 --> 00:42:19,254
"Are fly gov."

469
00:42:19,346 --> 00:42:21,552
"Era fly gov."

470
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,012
- "Elf gov ray."
- It's "Valley Forge".

471
00:42:24,935 --> 00:42:27,508
"Valley For..."
I don't have that on my computer.

472
00:42:27,604 --> 00:42:29,680
It's "Valley Forge" -
she pressed the E and L twice.

473
00:42:29,770 --> 00:42:32,602
Valley Forge was a turning point
in the American Revolution.

474
00:42:32,687 --> 00:42:35,225
Can I marry your brain?

475
00:42:39,610 --> 00:42:41,603
We're in.

476
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:47,117
Hello.

477
00:42:52,873 --> 00:42:54,950
Ben, you're doing great.

478
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:05,757
Ben, pick it up.

479
00:43:14,478 --> 00:43:16,471
You got about one...

480
00:43:21,152 --> 00:43:22,527
We own video.

481
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:25,859
- I lost my feed.
- What?

482
00:43:25,948 --> 00:43:27,775
I lost my feed, Ben.

483
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:29,906
I don't know where anyone is.
I have nothing.

484
00:43:29,994 --> 00:43:31,536
Ben, I have no...
Ben, I have nothing.

485
00:43:31,621 --> 00:43:34,325
Get out of there.
Get out of there now.

486
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:36,953
I'm taking the whole thing.
I'll get it out in the elevator.

487
00:43:37,043 --> 00:43:39,794
What are you talking about?
Is it heavy?

488
00:43:45,301 --> 00:43:47,874
Shaw. Door three, one minute.

489
00:44:03,819 --> 00:44:05,362
Gates.

490
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:12,020
What was that?

491
00:44:14,115 --> 00:44:15,989
Who's shooting?

492
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:19,861
- Damn.
- He's got the bloody map!

493
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,999
Are you still there? Ben?

494
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,707
I'm in the elevator.

495
00:44:25,293 --> 00:44:30,501
- Lan's here. There was, uh, shooting.
- I hate that guy.

496
00:44:35,178 --> 00:44:39,721
Hey, Rebecca.
Do you have a Paul Brown on that list?

497
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:41,267
Paul Brown?

498
00:44:41,351 --> 00:44:42,929
No. Not here.

499
00:44:56,616 --> 00:44:58,490
Have a good night.

500
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:08,538
Are you trying to steal that?

501
00:45:13,592 --> 00:45:15,300
It's $35.

502
00:45:16,887 --> 00:45:19,128
- For this?
- Yeah.

503
00:45:19,222 --> 00:45:22,389
- That's a lot.
- Hey, I don't make the prices.

504
00:45:25,312 --> 00:45:26,426
It's...

505
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:31,399
I have $32...

506
00:45:35,614 --> 00:45:37,440
57 c.

507
00:45:38,116 --> 00:45:40,607
We take Visa.

508
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:52,588
This is Mike. Sublevel three.
I have an alert.

509
00:45:52,677 --> 00:45:55,382
Where are you, Ben?

510
00:46:19,954 --> 00:46:22,527
- Where are you?
- Stop talking.

511
00:46:24,041 --> 00:46:26,283
Start the van.

512
00:46:32,508 --> 00:46:37,716
Ben, the...
the mean Declaration lady's behind you.

513
00:46:42,518 --> 00:46:44,262
Hey.

514
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:46,891
Oh, it's you. Hello.

515
00:46:46,981 --> 00:46:49,733
Mr Brown, what's going on?
What's that?

516
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,898
- It's a souvenir.
- Really?

517
00:46:52,987 --> 00:46:55,027
Stop chatting and get in the van.

518
00:47:00,828 --> 00:47:02,785
Code red. Code red.
We have a break-in.

519
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:06,739
Lock it down. Nobody leaves the building.
Get the FBI on the phone.

520
00:47:10,922 --> 00:47:13,543
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Yeah.

521
00:47:17,553 --> 00:47:20,554
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You did not...?

522
00:47:21,224 --> 00:47:23,347
- No...
- Security! Over here!

523
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:25,427
- Give me that!
- It's yours. Take it.

524
00:47:26,103 --> 00:47:27,811
Security!

525
00:47:27,897 --> 00:47:31,805
- Over here! Security!
- Got you.

526
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:33,558
Go.

527
00:47:33,647 --> 00:47:35,686
Viktor! Move!

528
00:47:35,774 --> 00:47:37,850
- We can't just let her go!
- We can. Go!

529
00:47:39,236 --> 00:47:41,905
- Security, over here!
- Wait. No, hold it.

530
00:47:41,988 --> 00:47:43,613
Hold it!

531
00:47:45,826 --> 00:47:46,821
- Wha...?
- Oh, bad.

532
00:47:46,910 --> 00:47:48,369
- What do you want?
- Give me the document.

533
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:50,446
Bad, bad, bad!

534
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,042
- Let me go!
- Just bring her!

535
00:47:56,128 --> 00:47:57,538
No! No!

536
00:48:04,636 --> 00:48:06,427
- That's...
- Go! Go!

537
00:48:16,314 --> 00:48:18,390
And just who might you be?

538
00:48:21,987 --> 00:48:24,941
- Once we catch them what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

539
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:28,277
Right turn, right turn.

540
00:48:29,995 --> 00:48:33,743
Why don't you just pass me that
document? Then we can all go home.

541
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:47,469
Oh, no.

542
00:49:02,152 --> 00:49:03,646
Skidding, skidding, skidding.

543
00:49:10,321 --> 00:49:12,527
- Oh, no!
- Holy Lord!

544
00:49:16,994 --> 00:49:20,861
- Help!
- No! If she falls, the document falls.

545
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:24,081
Get me next to her.

546
00:49:45,064 --> 00:49:46,973
- Thank you.
- No!

547
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:49,687
Got it. Go on.

548
00:49:50,653 --> 00:49:52,396
Abigail!

549
00:49:54,115 --> 00:49:56,072
Come on. Jump.

550
00:50:05,251 --> 00:50:09,794
- We lost them.
- That's all right. This... is what we need.

551
00:50:20,057 --> 00:50:22,726
Well done, Gates. Well done.

552
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:27,809
- Are you all right?
- No! Those lunatics...

553
00:50:27,898 --> 00:50:30,436
- You're not hurt, are you?
- You are all lunatics!

554
00:50:30,526 --> 00:50:32,068
- Are you hungry?
- What?

555
00:50:32,153 --> 00:50:33,528
Are you all right?

556
00:50:33,612 --> 00:50:37,562
Still a little on edge from being shot at,
but I'll be OK. Thanks for asking.

557
00:50:37,658 --> 00:50:41,359
Yeah, well, I'm not all right. Those men
have the Declaration of Independence!

558
00:50:41,454 --> 00:50:44,657
- She lost it?
- They don't have it.

559
00:50:46,417 --> 00:50:49,994
See? OK?
Now could you please stop shouting?

560
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:54,617
- Give me that!
- You're still shouting. It's starting to annoy.

561
00:50:55,170 --> 00:50:58,621
You'd do well, Dr Chase,
to be a bit more civilised in this instance.

562
00:50:58,923 --> 00:51:01,628
If this is the real one, what did they get?

563
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:03,801
A souvenir.

564
00:51:03,887 --> 00:51:07,505
I thought it'd be a good idea to have
a duplicate. It turned out I was right.

565
00:51:07,932 --> 00:51:14,302
I actually had to pay for the souvenir and
the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.

566
00:51:14,773 --> 00:51:17,690
- Genius.
- Who were those men?

567
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:20,183
Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

568
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:22,152
And you didn't believe us.

569
00:51:22,238 --> 00:51:24,812
We did the only thing we could do
to keep it safe.

570
00:51:26,034 --> 00:51:27,528
Verdammt! Give me that!

571
00:51:27,619 --> 00:51:29,907
You know something?
You're shouting again.

572
00:51:29,996 --> 00:51:31,953
I'm pretty sure she was swearing, too.

573
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:35,124
Well, we probably deserve that.

574
00:51:41,674 --> 00:51:43,833
Ladies and gentlemen...

575
00:51:43,927 --> 00:51:48,256
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Peter Sadusky. I'm the agent in charge.

576
00:51:48,348 --> 00:51:51,432
I wanna reassure you,
you are not in danger in any way.

577
00:51:51,518 --> 00:51:56,310
If we all cooperate, we'll get through this
with as little frustration as possible.

578
00:51:56,773 --> 00:51:58,765
Thank you.

579
00:52:00,026 --> 00:52:04,735
Get positive IDs. Search everyone,
including the security staff.

580
00:52:04,823 --> 00:52:07,610
If they refuse,
detain them and get warrants.

581
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:10,191
Yes, Agent Hendricks?
You have something?

582
00:52:10,954 --> 00:52:11,618
Um...

583
00:52:11,704 --> 00:52:16,165
- This isn't a day for "Um..."
- We got a tip several days ago

584
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:19,287
that someone was going to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

585
00:52:19,379 --> 00:52:22,296
Do we have a name on the tipster?

586
00:52:22,382 --> 00:52:25,965
There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

587
00:52:27,595 --> 00:52:29,303
How about now?

588
00:52:29,389 --> 00:52:33,427
There is not a treasure map on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

589
00:52:33,512 --> 00:52:37,426
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

590
00:52:38,434 --> 00:52:41,803
I levelled with you 100 per cent.
Everything I told you was the truth.

591
00:52:41,895 --> 00:52:44,102
I want that document, Mr Brown.

592
00:52:44,481 --> 00:52:47,186
OK, my name's not Brown.
It's Gates.

593
00:52:47,276 --> 00:52:49,648
I levelled with you 98 per cent.

594
00:52:49,736 --> 00:52:52,406
Wait a minute, did you just say "Gates"?

595
00:52:53,449 --> 00:52:55,073
Gates?

596
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:58,693
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

597
00:52:58,787 --> 00:53:02,121
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

598
00:53:02,207 --> 00:53:06,039
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

599
00:53:06,128 --> 00:53:08,334
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

600
00:53:08,422 --> 00:53:10,580
- Yes, we decided to...
- Leave it there.

601
00:53:10,674 --> 00:53:13,295
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

602
00:53:13,385 --> 00:53:16,552
They got him with a Taser at the service
entrance. He doesn't remember a thing.

603
00:53:16,638 --> 00:53:18,761
Also, we found bullet casings.

604
00:53:18,849 --> 00:53:20,473
Did we get a description
from the other guards?

605
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,560
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

606
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:27,773
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

607
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:30,267
So...

608
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,564
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

609
00:53:33,655 --> 00:53:35,981
and why weren't they getting along?

610
00:53:36,074 --> 00:53:38,910
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

611
00:53:38,994 --> 00:53:42,161
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

612
00:53:42,247 --> 00:53:43,907
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

613
00:53:43,999 --> 00:53:47,202
EDS suits, a particulate air filtration
system, the whole shebang.

614
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:49,832
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

615
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,665
What? Why not?

616
00:53:51,757 --> 00:53:55,589
This is the guy. Dr Herbert said
Dr Chase introduced him as Mr Brown.

617
00:53:55,677 --> 00:53:56,958
Not on the guestlist.

618
00:53:57,054 --> 00:54:01,182
Now, the gift-store clerk - she said
he seemed... Well, she said "flustered".

619
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:04,220
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

620
00:54:04,311 --> 00:54:06,268
without paying.

621
00:54:06,355 --> 00:54:08,312
He paid with a Visa.

622
00:54:08,398 --> 00:54:11,559
"Charge to Benjamin Gates."

623
00:54:11,646 --> 00:54:14,351
A credit-card slip?

624
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,100
Dude, we're on the grid.

625
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:19,027
They'll have your records from forever.
They'll have my records from forever.

626
00:54:19,112 --> 00:54:22,646
I know. I know. It's only a matter of minutes
before the FBI shows up at my front door.

627
00:54:22,740 --> 00:54:24,780
What do we do?

628
00:54:24,867 --> 00:54:27,785
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

629
00:54:30,081 --> 00:54:32,038
You know, get off the road,
take a right.

630
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:33,951
What letters?

631
00:54:34,836 --> 00:54:39,877
You have the original Silence Dogood
letters? Did you steal those, too?

632
00:54:39,966 --> 00:54:42,042
We have scans of the originals.

633
00:54:42,135 --> 00:54:44,970
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

634
00:54:45,054 --> 00:54:48,589
Oh, I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

635
00:54:51,644 --> 00:54:56,021
- Why do you need them?
- She really can't shut her mouth, can she?

636
00:54:56,107 --> 00:54:59,807
I'll tell you what, look.
I will let you hold onto this

637
00:54:59,902 --> 00:55:02,689
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

638
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:05,318
Thank you.

639
00:55:06,033 --> 00:55:08,441
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- I know what to do.

640
00:55:08,536 --> 00:55:11,241
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

641
00:55:11,330 --> 00:55:14,035
Well, not to be a... nudge,

642
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:18,123
but you do realise how many people
we have after us.

643
00:55:18,212 --> 00:55:21,498
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

644
00:55:22,675 --> 00:55:28,132
It took you all of two seconds to decide
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

645
00:55:28,222 --> 00:55:32,137
Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

646
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:34,896
Hey, not cool! Not cool!

647
00:55:34,979 --> 00:55:37,055
Let me go!

648
00:55:37,148 --> 00:55:39,437
OK. You're let go. Go, shoo.

649
00:55:39,525 --> 00:55:41,814
I'm not going. Not without the Declaration.

650
00:55:41,903 --> 00:55:44,820
You're not going with the Declaration.

651
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:48,571
Yes, I am. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

652
00:55:48,659 --> 00:55:51,857
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

653
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:55,234
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

654
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,492
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind,

655
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:02,031
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

656
00:56:17,724 --> 00:56:19,717
Clear.

657
00:56:20,435 --> 00:56:22,724
What the...

658
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:26,899
Now we're getting somewhere.

659
00:56:27,859 --> 00:56:31,691
They're digital scans of letters
to the editor of The New England Courant.

660
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:34,485
Written 1722.

661
00:56:34,574 --> 00:56:38,904
They're all from the same person.
"Your humble servant, Silence Dogood."

662
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,468
Gentlemen...

663
00:56:56,555 --> 00:57:00,766
why is this word capitalised?

664
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:04,645
Because it's important?

665
00:57:06,857 --> 00:57:09,182
Because it's a name.

666
00:57:09,276 --> 00:57:12,277
OK, I got it.
When Ben Franklin was only 15 years old

667
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,280
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

668
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:19,030
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

669
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:21,824
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

670
00:57:28,795 --> 00:57:31,161
Looks OK.

671
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,871
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- Well, how long do you think we got?

672
00:57:33,961 --> 00:57:37,544
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. I hope.

673
00:57:37,631 --> 00:57:41,629
What do we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

674
00:57:41,719 --> 00:57:43,961
No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.

675
00:57:44,054 --> 00:57:47,258
- Promise you won't be any trouble.
- I promise.

676
00:57:47,349 --> 00:57:49,307
See? She's curious.

677
00:57:53,105 --> 00:57:57,601
Here's what I got on Gates. A degree
in American History from Georgetown,

678
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:59,852
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT,

679
00:57:59,945 --> 00:58:04,488
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Centre.

680
00:58:05,201 --> 00:58:07,905
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

681
00:58:07,995 --> 00:58:09,988
We keep our focus on Gates.

682
00:58:10,081 --> 00:58:12,369
Run him to ground.

683
00:58:12,458 --> 00:58:16,242
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

684
00:58:16,712 --> 00:58:19,464
I want to find out who this guy is.

685
00:58:28,182 --> 00:58:29,462
Dad.

686
00:58:31,852 --> 00:58:33,845
Where's the party?

687
00:58:34,396 --> 00:58:38,180
Well... I'm in a little trouble.

688
00:58:39,235 --> 00:58:41,856
- Is she pregnant?
- Well, if she is,

689
00:58:41,946 --> 00:58:46,406
are you gonna leave the woman carrying
your grandchild standing out in the cold?

690
00:58:46,492 --> 00:58:48,864
I look pregnant?

691
00:58:53,582 --> 00:58:56,832
This better not be about
that dumb treasure.

692
00:59:02,091 --> 00:59:04,712
Well, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

693
00:59:04,802 --> 00:59:08,669
There's some pizza.
It's still warm, I think.

694
00:59:08,764 --> 00:59:10,300
Dad...

695
00:59:12,303 --> 00:59:17,215
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
Yeah, it's about the treasure.

696
00:59:17,308 --> 00:59:19,348
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

697
00:59:19,436 --> 00:59:21,891
- Literally.
- I volunteered.

698
00:59:21,980 --> 00:59:25,183
Well, unvolunteer,
before you waste your life.

699
00:59:25,275 --> 00:59:28,311
- Knock it off, Dad.
- Sure, sure, I know, I'm the family kook.

700
00:59:28,403 --> 00:59:30,645
I have a job, a house, health insurance.

701
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:34,902
At least I had your mother, for however
brief a time. At least I had you.

702
00:59:34,993 --> 00:59:37,282
What do you have? Him?

703
00:59:39,497 --> 00:59:42,664
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

704
00:59:42,751 --> 00:59:44,660
You disappoint me, Ben.

705
00:59:44,753 --> 00:59:49,829
Well, maybe that's the real Gates-family
legacy. Sons who disappoint their fathers.

706
00:59:51,342 --> 00:59:53,964
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

707
00:59:59,392 --> 01:00:01,883
I found the Charlotte.

708
01:00:06,316 --> 01:00:08,308
The Charlotte?

709
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:12,022
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah, she was beautiful.

710
01:00:12,113 --> 01:00:13,109
It was amazing, Dad.

711
01:00:13,198 --> 01:00:15,949
And the treasure?

712
01:00:16,034 --> 01:00:18,786
No, no. But we found another clue
that led us here.

713
01:00:18,870 --> 01:00:21,539
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

714
01:00:21,623 --> 01:00:24,196
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue. Don't you get it, Ben?

715
01:00:24,292 --> 01:00:25,751
I finally figured it out.

716
01:00:25,835 --> 01:00:29,038
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

717
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,882
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

718
01:00:31,966 --> 01:00:36,213
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

719
01:00:36,304 --> 01:00:39,554
The treasure is a myth.

720
01:00:39,641 --> 01:00:41,966
I refuse to believe that.

721
01:00:47,190 --> 01:00:51,431
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person. What am I doing?

722
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:54,772
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

723
01:00:56,276 --> 01:01:01,022
He's probably right. You don't even know
if there is another clue.

724
01:01:03,075 --> 01:01:07,571
Well, I can think of a way where we could
find out. And we can find out right now.

725
01:01:25,722 --> 01:01:27,799
Looks like animal skin.

726
01:01:28,475 --> 01:01:31,595
- How old is it?
- At least 200 years.

727
01:01:31,687 --> 01:01:35,387
- Really? You sure?
- Pretty darn.

728
01:01:35,482 --> 01:01:37,973
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how do we look at it?

729
01:01:38,068 --> 01:01:39,349
Throw it in the oven.

730
01:01:39,445 --> 01:01:41,022
- No.
- Uh-uh.

731
01:01:41,113 --> 01:01:43,782
Ferrous sulphate inks
can only be brought out with heat.

732
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,032
- Yes, but this...
- It's very old.

733
01:01:47,119 --> 01:01:52,825
This is very old, and we can't
risk compromising the map.

734
01:01:52,916 --> 01:01:54,079
You need a reagent.

735
01:01:54,168 --> 01:01:56,872
Dad, it's really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

736
01:01:56,962 --> 01:01:59,453
I'm fine.

737
01:01:59,548 --> 01:02:01,375
Lemons.

738
01:02:07,973 --> 01:02:10,298
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

739
01:02:10,392 --> 01:02:14,639
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

740
01:02:15,647 --> 01:02:17,557
OK.

741
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:21,109
OK.

742
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:25,280
Now, if there is a secret message,

743
01:02:25,365 --> 01:02:30,698
it'll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

744
01:02:30,782 --> 01:02:32,359
That's right.

745
01:02:36,162 --> 01:02:38,570
I am so getting fired for this.

746
01:03:10,029 --> 01:03:12,816
I told you. You need heat.

747
01:03:30,842 --> 01:03:32,550
See?

748
01:03:35,221 --> 01:03:37,344
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

749
01:03:51,863 --> 01:03:54,235
That's not a map.

750
01:03:54,323 --> 01:03:57,443
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

751
01:03:57,535 --> 01:03:59,195
Are those latitudes and longitudes?

752
01:03:59,287 --> 01:04:01,825
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

753
01:04:01,914 --> 01:04:04,999
- That's the key?
- Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected."

754
01:04:05,084 --> 01:04:06,709
Dad, can we have the letters now?

755
01:04:06,794 --> 01:04:11,249
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

756
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:13,742
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

757
01:04:13,837 --> 01:04:15,664
Oh, OK.

758
01:04:15,756 --> 01:04:18,673
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

759
01:04:18,759 --> 01:04:23,088
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

760
01:04:23,180 --> 01:04:25,967
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

761
01:04:26,058 --> 01:04:28,180
In this case,
the Silence Dogood letters.

762
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:30,676
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

763
01:04:30,771 --> 01:04:34,056
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

764
01:04:34,149 --> 01:04:36,770
So, Dad, where are the letters?

765
01:04:36,860 --> 01:04:41,855
You know, it's just by sheer happenstance
that his grandfather...

766
01:04:41,948 --> 01:04:43,111
- Dad.
...even found them.

767
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:45,488
They were in an antique desk
from the press room...

768
01:04:45,577 --> 01:04:47,237
- Dad.
...of The New England Courant.

769
01:04:47,329 --> 01:04:50,365
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad, where are the letters?

770
01:04:50,457 --> 01:04:53,209
I don't have them, son.

771
01:04:53,293 --> 01:04:56,045
- What?
- I don't have them.

772
01:05:02,928 --> 01:05:04,303
Where are they?

773
01:05:04,388 --> 01:05:07,887
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

774
01:05:08,475 --> 01:05:10,468
Time to go.

775
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:16,146
I still can't believe it. All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

776
01:05:16,233 --> 01:05:17,691
The back of what?

777
01:05:17,776 --> 01:05:19,899
No!

778
01:05:19,986 --> 01:05:22,477
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know.

779
01:05:22,572 --> 01:05:25,146
Oh, my God. What have you done?
This is... this is the...

780
01:05:25,242 --> 01:05:27,993
- I know!
- This is the Declaration of Independence.

781
01:05:28,078 --> 01:05:31,245
Yes. And it's very delicate.

782
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,537
You stole it?

783
01:05:33,625 --> 01:05:38,964
Dad, I can explain, but I don't have time.
It was necessary. And you saw the cipher.

784
01:05:39,047 --> 01:05:41,752
And that will lead to another clue,
and that will lead to another clue!

785
01:05:41,842 --> 01:05:45,211
There is no treasure.
I wasted 20 years of my life.

786
01:05:45,303 --> 01:05:48,139
And now you've destroyed yours.

787
01:05:48,974 --> 01:05:51,174
And you pulled me into all this.

788
01:05:51,971 --> 01:05:54,758
Well, we can't have that.

789
01:05:59,395 --> 01:06:01,968
Come in!

790
01:06:02,064 --> 01:06:04,057
I'm in here.

791
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:07,018
FBI, right?

792
01:06:10,906 --> 01:06:13,279
You gonna untie me?

793
01:06:15,953 --> 01:06:18,444
And you have no idea where he's going?

794
01:06:18,539 --> 01:06:22,584
- Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?
- Would you?

795
01:06:22,668 --> 01:06:24,791
He tied me to a chair.

796
01:06:24,879 --> 01:06:28,923
The garage is empty, but there's a Cadillac
De Ville registered to Patrick Gates.

797
01:06:29,008 --> 01:06:31,084
And he stole my car.

798
01:06:31,510 --> 01:06:35,175
Don't worry, Mr Gates, we'll find your car.
And your son.

799
01:06:37,808 --> 01:06:40,134
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

800
01:06:40,227 --> 01:06:43,062
I think we should change clothes.

801
01:06:43,147 --> 01:06:45,685
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

802
01:06:45,775 --> 01:06:48,775
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

803
01:06:48,861 --> 01:06:50,854
Here, I took this from his house.

804
01:06:50,946 --> 01:06:54,647
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

805
01:06:54,742 --> 01:06:58,905
- Common Sense. How appropriate.
- When are we gonna get there?

806
01:06:58,996 --> 01:07:02,579
I'm hungry. This car smells weird.

807
01:07:47,038 --> 01:07:49,197
Excuse me.

808
01:07:49,290 --> 01:07:52,208
Excuse me. Oops, sorry, sir. Excuse me.

809
01:07:52,293 --> 01:07:54,286
That's OK.

810
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,883
S-S-A-N-D.

811
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:04,631
OK.

812
01:08:06,057 --> 01:08:08,809
You're sure this is right?

813
01:08:10,186 --> 01:08:11,562
OK.

814
01:08:11,646 --> 01:08:13,473
S-S-A...

815
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:16,315
No, N.

816
01:08:16,401 --> 01:08:19,651
- That is an N.
- It doesn't look like an N.

817
01:08:21,573 --> 01:08:24,858
You know what? Here. Last one. OK?

818
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:28,408
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

819
01:08:28,913 --> 01:08:31,072
Go get the last four letters.

820
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:33,573
Go get 'em, chief. Come on.

821
01:08:51,686 --> 01:08:56,099
OK. "The vision to see the treasured past

822
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:02,609
comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and..."

823
01:09:02,697 --> 01:09:05,366
"Pass and..." what?

824
01:09:18,832 --> 01:09:21,502
"Pass and..."

825
01:09:47,569 --> 01:09:50,060
What's going on?

826
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:54,108
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

827
01:09:56,620 --> 01:10:00,071
So you show up at your father's door
and say you're in trouble

828
01:10:00,165 --> 01:10:03,997
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

829
01:10:04,086 --> 01:10:06,458
Is there a question in there?

830
01:10:06,547 --> 01:10:09,085
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

831
01:10:09,174 --> 01:10:13,219
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

832
01:10:13,303 --> 01:10:16,008
- I see.
- Let me ask you something.

833
01:10:16,098 --> 01:10:19,015
Have you ever told someone -
not a relative - "I love you"?

834
01:10:19,101 --> 01:10:21,307
Yes.

835
01:10:21,395 --> 01:10:24,064
More than one someone?

836
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:26,399
Yes.

837
01:10:26,483 --> 01:10:28,357
Oh. Well, then my father would say

838
01:10:28,444 --> 01:10:31,813
you've been a little too cavalier
in your personal life, too.

839
01:10:31,905 --> 01:10:35,357
So you get your sense of absolute certainty
from him, do you?

840
01:10:35,451 --> 01:10:37,360
Well, I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

841
01:10:37,453 --> 01:10:42,198
Well, you're certain the treasure is real,
despite what anyone else thinks.

842
01:10:42,291 --> 01:10:43,785
No, but I hope it's real.

843
01:10:43,876 --> 01:10:48,372
I mean, I've dreamt it's real
since my grandfather told me about it.

844
01:10:48,464 --> 01:10:51,708
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I'm so close, I can taste it.

845
01:10:51,794 --> 01:10:56,540
But I just... I just want to know it's not just
something in my head or in my heart.

846
01:11:00,470 --> 01:11:03,387
People don't really talk that way, you know.

847
01:11:03,473 --> 01:11:07,091
I know. But they think that way.

848
01:11:13,232 --> 01:11:14,146
Hey.

849
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:16,226
- Did you get it? Riley?
- Oh, I got it.

850
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:20,019
"The vision to see
the treasured past comes

851
01:11:20,114 --> 01:11:25,453
as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of Pass and Stow."

852
01:11:25,536 --> 01:11:28,371
Now, "Pass and Stow", of course,
referring to...

853
01:11:28,456 --> 01:11:31,291
- The Liberty Bell.
- Why do you have to do that?

854
01:11:31,376 --> 01:11:33,913
Well, John Pass and John Stow
cast the bell.

855
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:37,170
OK. Well, then, what does
the rest of this mean?

856
01:11:37,256 --> 01:11:41,965
Wait..."The vision to see the treasured
past" must refer to a way to read the map.

857
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:43,595
Well, I thought the cipher was the map.

858
01:11:43,679 --> 01:11:46,550
No, the cipher was a way
to find the way to read the map.

859
01:11:46,641 --> 01:11:48,265
And the way to read the map can be found

860
01:11:48,351 --> 01:11:52,894
where the "timely shadow" crosses
in front of the Liberty Bell.

861
01:11:52,980 --> 01:11:56,266
Crosses in front of the "house"
of the Liberty Bell. Independence Hall.

862
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:59,810
Right, so "timely shadow" -
it's a specific time.

863
01:12:00,363 --> 01:12:02,402
- Right.
- What time?

864
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:05,277
What time? What time?

865
01:12:05,993 --> 01:12:09,160
Wait a minute, wait.
You're gonna love this.

866
01:12:09,247 --> 01:12:12,912
Excuse me, can I see one of those
hundred-dollar bills I paid you with?

867
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:14,578
No.

868
01:12:15,044 --> 01:12:18,544
Oh. Well, here,
I have this diver's watch.

869
01:12:18,631 --> 01:12:21,383
It's called a Submariner. I dive with it.
It's actually quite valuable.

870
01:12:21,467 --> 01:12:23,543
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.

871
01:12:23,636 --> 01:12:25,130
Thank you.

872
01:12:25,221 --> 01:12:27,926
On the back of a hundred-dollar bill
is an etching of Independence Hall

873
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,639
- based on a painting done in...
- Hello.

874
01:12:29,723 --> 01:12:32,008
Thank you.
...in the 1780s, who...

875
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:35,513
The artist was actually a friend
of Benjamin Franklin's. It's wonderful.

876
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:37,225
- Fascinating.
- Hold this.

877
01:12:37,310 --> 01:12:39,350
OK.

878
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:41,930
I'm not going anywhere.

879
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:46,017
Now, I think that if we look
at this clock tower...

880
01:12:47,154 --> 01:12:49,858
...we may find the specific time.

881
01:12:52,659 --> 01:12:55,826
- What do you see?
- 2:22.

882
01:12:55,912 --> 01:12:59,281
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.

883
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,828
- We missed it.
- No, we didn't.

884
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:06,756
We didn't miss it because...

885
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:11,134
You don't know this? L-I know something
about history that you don't know.

886
01:13:11,219 --> 01:13:13,259
I'd be very excited to learn about it, Riley.

887
01:13:13,346 --> 01:13:16,632
Well, hold on one second, let me just...
let me just take in this moment.

888
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,263
This is... this is cool.

889
01:13:19,352 --> 01:13:23,136
Is this how you feel all the time? Because,
you know... Except for now, of course.

890
01:13:23,231 --> 01:13:25,271
- Riley!
- All right.

891
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:30,697
What I know is that daylight savings
wasn't established until World War I.

892
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:36,404
If it's 3pm now, OK, that means
in 1776, it would be 2pm.

893
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:38,452
- Let's go.
- Riley, you're a genius.

894
01:13:38,538 --> 01:13:40,827
Yeah.

895
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:44,498
Do you actually know who the first person
to suggest daylight savings was?

896
01:13:44,586 --> 01:13:47,373
- Benjamin Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin.

897
01:13:47,964 --> 01:13:50,087
Is this real?

898
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,464
Just tell me what you told my friend.

899
01:13:52,552 --> 01:13:56,253
Just a bunch of letters.
I can't remember.

900
01:13:56,348 --> 01:14:00,809
Can you remember which ones
you were gonna tell him next?

901
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:03,681
Yeah, here. S-T-O-W.

902
01:14:11,691 --> 01:14:16,068
Top results: Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall.

903
01:14:19,407 --> 01:14:22,941
Imagine its impact
back in the 18th century.

904
01:14:23,035 --> 01:14:27,115
It could have been seen for miles around,
which was exactly its purpose,

905
01:14:27,206 --> 01:14:32,164
because it served as a beacon, as it were,
for people to collect and hear...

906
01:14:46,892 --> 01:14:47,841
Good stuff.

907
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:52,680
It gained a place in history
on July 8, 1776,

908
01:14:52,773 --> 01:14:55,181
when the Liberty Bell tolled
for the first public reading

909
01:14:55,276 --> 01:14:57,897
of the Declaration of Independence.

910
01:14:57,987 --> 01:15:00,110
Eventually, it was moved from its place

911
01:15:00,197 --> 01:15:02,653
in Independence Hall steeple
and given its own...

912
01:15:02,742 --> 01:15:05,363
- Idiot.
- Who?

913
01:15:05,453 --> 01:15:06,947
- Me.
- What?

914
01:15:07,038 --> 01:15:10,074
It's not here. It's there.

915
01:15:10,958 --> 01:15:12,951
Come on.

916
01:15:21,469 --> 01:15:23,794
- What bell is this?
- It's the Centennial Bell.

917
01:15:23,888 --> 01:15:27,339
It replaced the Liberty Bell in 1876.

918
01:15:35,024 --> 01:15:37,063
There it is.

919
01:15:37,151 --> 01:15:40,520
All right. I'm gonna go down there,
and you meet me in the signing room.

920
01:15:40,613 --> 01:15:42,938
- OK? All right.
- OK.

921
01:15:43,032 --> 01:15:45,404
All right, let's go.

922
01:15:45,493 --> 01:15:48,826
3:22. My idea.

923
01:16:56,474 --> 01:16:58,384
Hey. What'd you score?

924
01:16:58,476 --> 01:16:59,971
I found this.

925
01:17:00,061 --> 01:17:02,552
Some kind of ocular device.

926
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:06,063
"The vision to see the treasured past."
Let me take this.

927
01:17:06,151 --> 01:17:09,851
Aw, they're like early American
X-ray specs.

928
01:17:09,946 --> 01:17:14,074
Benjamin Franklin invented
something like these.

929
01:17:14,159 --> 01:17:16,447
I think he invented these.

930
01:17:16,536 --> 01:17:18,576
So, what do we do with them?

931
01:17:19,080 --> 01:17:21,203
We look through it.

932
01:17:24,085 --> 01:17:26,125
Here, help me.

933
01:17:27,505 --> 01:17:30,169
- Careful.
- You think?

934
01:17:36,216 --> 01:17:40,677
- What?
- It's just that the last time this was here

935
01:17:40,763 --> 01:17:43,088
it was being signed.

936
01:17:45,726 --> 01:17:49,344
- Ben, there's another tour coming.
- Turn it over.

937
01:17:49,438 --> 01:17:52,107
- Careful.
- Spectacles.

938
01:18:04,411 --> 01:18:06,368
What do you see?

939
01:18:09,208 --> 01:18:11,829
What is it? Is it a treasure map?

940
01:18:11,919 --> 01:18:16,830
It says, "Heere at the wall",
spelled with two E's.

941
01:18:16,924 --> 01:18:18,916
Take a look.

942
01:18:22,930 --> 01:18:24,554
Wow.

943
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,218
Why can't they just say, "Go to this place,
and here's the treasure, spend it wisely"?

944
01:18:29,311 --> 01:18:31,767
Oh, no.

945
01:18:32,481 --> 01:18:34,853
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

946
01:18:35,859 --> 01:18:37,354
How'd they find us?

947
01:18:37,444 --> 01:18:40,979
Well, lan has nearly unlimited resources.
And he's smart.

948
01:18:41,073 --> 01:18:43,694
I don't think we can get out of here
without being spotted.

949
01:18:43,784 --> 01:18:46,701
Well, we don't want them to have
the Declaration, or the glasses.

950
01:18:46,787 --> 01:18:49,408
Âtt we especiaìíx don't want them
to have them both together.

951
01:18:49,498 --> 01:18:52,452
- So what do we do?
- We separate the lock from the key.

952
01:18:52,543 --> 01:18:54,582
- We're splitting up.
- Good idea.

953
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:55,832
Really?

954
01:18:55,921 --> 01:18:58,127
I'll take this.

955
01:18:58,215 --> 01:19:01,880
And those. You keep that. Meet me at the
car and call me if you have any problems.

956
01:19:01,969 --> 01:19:04,923
Like if we get caught and killed?

957
01:19:05,014 --> 01:19:08,548
Yeah. That would be a big problem.
Take care of her.

958
01:19:08,642 --> 01:19:10,925
- I will.
- I will.

959
01:19:19,564 --> 01:19:21,272
We're on him.

960
01:19:23,776 --> 01:19:25,603
There he is.

961
01:19:29,657 --> 01:19:32,065
- Let's walk this way.
- Wait up.

962
01:19:32,827 --> 01:19:36,243
- Shaw, look. There's the others.
- I got it.

963
01:19:37,665 --> 01:19:42,742
Viktor, meet me at Fifth and Chestnut. Fifth
and Chestnut. They're heading your way.

964
01:20:07,904 --> 01:20:09,481
- Look out! Look out!
- Riley!

965
01:20:09,572 --> 01:20:12,490
- There they are! Move!
- Move!

966
01:20:13,368 --> 01:20:16,072
- Time to run.
- Keep up, Viktor! Move. Come on.

967
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:25,333
In here.

968
01:20:30,301 --> 01:20:32,508
- Come on.
- Follow me.

969
01:20:37,809 --> 01:20:39,801
That way.

970
01:20:46,651 --> 01:20:49,895
If you're not a steak,
you don't belong here.

971
01:20:50,399 --> 01:20:53,649
I'm just trying to hide
from my ex-husband.

972
01:20:53,735 --> 01:20:56,522
- Who, baldy?
- Yes.

973
01:20:57,197 --> 01:20:59,320
Honey, stay as long as you like.

974
01:20:59,408 --> 01:21:01,696
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

975
01:21:01,785 --> 01:21:03,778
You want something?

976
01:21:09,835 --> 01:21:12,504
- Do you want something?
- Shut up.

977
01:21:15,257 --> 01:21:17,333
I see why you left him.

978
01:21:22,889 --> 01:21:24,882
Go around. Go around.

979
01:21:30,564 --> 01:21:32,307
Gates!

980
01:21:58,258 --> 01:22:00,583
Aw, come on!

981
01:22:10,103 --> 01:22:12,559
- Where were you?
- Hiding.

982
01:22:12,647 --> 01:22:14,889
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

983
01:22:20,030 --> 01:22:23,031
Lan. Lan, I've got 'em.
They're heading toward City Hall.

984
01:22:23,116 --> 01:22:26,201
- OK, I'm on my way.
- Out of the way!

985
01:22:55,267 --> 01:22:56,975
They're headed for the breezeway
on the north side.

986
01:22:57,061 --> 01:22:57,974
I'll be right there.

987
01:23:07,446 --> 01:23:09,439
Hey, Gates!

988
01:23:15,287 --> 01:23:18,703
Enough, man! Give me the document.

989
01:23:19,792 --> 01:23:21,998
All right, Phil.

990
01:23:38,853 --> 01:23:41,854
Watch out! Get out of my way!

991
01:23:45,526 --> 01:23:47,353
Watch it!

992
01:24:29,522 --> 01:24:31,729
Leave them! Let 'em go.

993
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,314
We've got it.

994
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:40,987
- FBI. Have you seen this guy?
- No.

995
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:43,618
Nope, I haven't seen him.

996
01:24:43,703 --> 01:24:46,657
Ted. Philadelphia police
found Gates's car.

997
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,120
It's close.
We got surveillance there now.

998
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:51,960
Let's go. Tell the boss
we got the car.

999
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,042
- What?
- We lost it.

1000
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:59,751
- What?
- We lost the Declaration. Lan took it.

1001
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:05,091
Yeah, OK. You all right?
You both all right?

1002
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:07,259
Yeah, yeah, we're all right.

1003
01:25:07,352 --> 01:25:10,555
- Ben, I'm sorry.
- We'll be fine.

1004
01:25:10,647 --> 01:25:13,185
Meet me at the car.

1005
01:25:19,072 --> 01:25:20,815
Suspect has arrived.

1006
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:26,284
Hello, Mr Gates.

1007
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:30,742
Mr Gates, face your father's car and
put your hands behind your back, please.

1008
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:34,416
- We got one in custody.
- Gates, you're a hard man to find.

1009
01:25:34,504 --> 01:25:36,082
Could you please be careful?

1010
01:25:50,347 --> 01:25:53,882
Riley, do you know
how to get in touch with lan?

1011
01:25:55,936 --> 01:25:57,763
Excuse me?

1012
01:26:02,234 --> 01:26:03,397
That's some story.

1013
01:26:03,485 --> 01:26:07,150
Well, it's the same story I tried to tell you
guys before the Declaration was stolen.

1014
01:26:07,239 --> 01:26:11,071
- By you.
- No, by lan. I stole it to stop him.

1015
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:14,410
I did it alone.
Dr Chase was not involved.

1016
01:26:14,997 --> 01:26:18,330
And lan still ended up with
the Declaration of Independence.

1017
01:26:18,417 --> 01:26:20,456
Because of you.

1018
01:26:21,086 --> 01:26:24,004
So here's your options.

1019
01:26:24,089 --> 01:26:28,169
Door number one,
you go to prison for a very long time.

1020
01:26:28,677 --> 01:26:33,719
Door number two, we are going to get back
the Declaration of Independence,

1021
01:26:33,807 --> 01:26:38,600
you help us find it, and you still
go to prison for a very long time,

1022
01:26:38,687 --> 01:26:41,095
but you feel better inside.

1023
01:26:41,190 --> 01:26:44,606
Is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?

1024
01:26:45,402 --> 01:26:48,522
- Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.
- Yeah.

1025
01:26:51,033 --> 01:26:53,322
So what are these for?

1026
01:26:53,410 --> 01:26:55,403
It's a way to read the map.

1027
01:26:55,496 --> 01:26:57,204
Right.

1028
01:26:57,289 --> 01:26:58,783
Knights Templar.

1029
01:26:58,874 --> 01:27:00,333
Freemasons.

1030
01:27:00,417 --> 01:27:02,908
Invisible treasure map.

1031
01:27:03,545 --> 01:27:07,294
- So what'd it say?
- "Heere at the wall."

1032
01:27:07,383 --> 01:27:09,874
Nothing else.

1033
01:27:09,968 --> 01:27:12,460
It's just another clue.

1034
01:27:12,554 --> 01:27:15,128
It looks like lan Howe
could be a false identity.

1035
01:27:15,224 --> 01:27:17,893
Follow up with ATF and INS.

1036
01:27:18,435 --> 01:27:20,891
There's more to it.

1037
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:23,471
- Standard tap procedure.
- Let's check the signal, folks.

1038
01:27:23,565 --> 01:27:25,891
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?

1039
01:27:25,985 --> 01:27:29,104
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.

1040
01:27:32,235 --> 01:27:33,480
Yes.

1041
01:27:33,569 --> 01:27:36,239
Hello, Ben. How are you?

1042
01:27:36,322 --> 01:27:39,738
- Um, chained to a desk.
- Sorry to hear that.

1043
01:27:40,284 --> 01:27:42,906
I want you to meet me on the flight deck
of the USS Intrepid.

1044
01:27:42,996 --> 01:27:45,072
- You know where that is?
- New York.

1045
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,532
Meet me there at ten o'clock
tomorrow morning.

1046
01:27:47,625 --> 01:27:51,124
And bring those glasses
you found at Independence Hall.

1047
01:27:51,212 --> 01:27:53,584
Yeah, I know about the glasses.

1048
01:27:54,549 --> 01:27:58,463
We can take a look at the Declaration,
and then you can be on your way.

1049
01:27:58,553 --> 01:28:00,344
And I'm supposed to believe that.

1050
01:28:00,430 --> 01:28:03,134
I told you from the start,
I only wanted to borrow it.

1051
01:28:03,641 --> 01:28:05,550
You can have it. And the glasses.

1052
01:28:05,643 --> 01:28:09,427
I'll even throw in the pipe
from the Charlotte.

1053
01:28:09,522 --> 01:28:11,230
I'll be there.

1054
01:28:11,316 --> 01:28:14,352
And tell the FBI agents
listening in on this call

1055
01:28:14,444 --> 01:28:18,358
if they want the Declaration back,
and not just a box of confetti,

1056
01:28:18,448 --> 01:28:20,820
then you'll come alone.

1057
01:28:33,838 --> 01:28:36,625
- Take positions.
- Perimeter looks normal.

1058
01:28:36,716 --> 01:28:40,085
- Can I get a status report?
- Crow's nest in position. Port side is quiet.

1059
01:28:40,178 --> 01:28:41,672
Copy that.

1060
01:28:51,773 --> 01:28:55,391
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.

1061
01:28:55,485 --> 01:28:58,688
- Do not lose sight of primary mark.
- Brian, you're clear with NYPD.

1062
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:01,318
- I have a visual.
- Gates.

1063
01:29:01,407 --> 01:29:02,605
Stay with the program.

1064
01:29:02,700 --> 01:29:05,986
I hope your agents are all under four feet
tall and wearing little scarves.

1065
01:29:06,079 --> 01:29:07,988
Otherwise lan's gonna know they're here.

1066
01:29:08,081 --> 01:29:10,910
As soon as he shows you the Declaration,
we'll move in.

1067
01:29:10,994 --> 01:29:13,568
Don't try anything.
Just let us handle it.

1068
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:17,827
You know, Agent Sadusky,
something I've noticed about fishing:

1069
01:29:17,918 --> 01:29:20,705
It never works out so well for the bait.

1070
01:29:27,260 --> 01:29:32,136
Sir, we've got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.

1071
01:29:32,224 --> 01:29:34,596
Unit two,
get an eyeball on that chopper.

1072
01:29:34,685 --> 01:29:38,136
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans
and authorization records on that craft.

1073
01:29:38,230 --> 01:29:41,563
If that's not Mr Howe,
I want to know who it is.

1074
01:29:41,650 --> 01:29:45,861
- I got him. He's coming from the north.
- Gates. Are you with me?

1075
01:29:45,946 --> 01:29:49,778
Well, I'm sure not against you,
if that's what you're asking.

1076
01:30:12,973 --> 01:30:15,380
We've got some interference
on Gates's mike, sir.

1077
01:30:15,475 --> 01:30:16,673
This I know.

1078
01:30:18,145 --> 01:30:20,683
Hello, Ben.

1079
01:30:20,772 --> 01:30:24,224
Thomas Edison needed only one way
to make a light bulb.

1080
01:30:24,318 --> 01:30:26,690
Sound familiar?

1081
01:30:28,739 --> 01:30:30,945
- Keep sightlines clear.
- What's the devil's going on?

1082
01:30:31,033 --> 01:30:32,693
There's a lot of commotion.
We can't see Gates.

1083
01:30:32,784 --> 01:30:37,577
Go to the starboard observation point
behind the F-16 and here's what you do.

1084
01:30:39,124 --> 01:30:40,499
Gates? Gates?

1085
01:30:40,584 --> 01:30:44,202
Air Tour helicopter,
you are in controlled airspace.

1086
01:30:44,296 --> 01:30:45,873
Vacate immediately.

1087
01:30:45,964 --> 01:30:47,542
Who's got Gates?

1088
01:30:47,633 --> 01:30:49,952
- All agents, report in.
- I can't see anything.

1089
01:30:50,046 --> 01:30:53,379
- Did Gates speak to anybody?
- Target is moving.

1090
01:30:53,466 --> 01:30:57,415
- He's heading towards the stern.
- I've got him. He's coming this way.

1091
01:30:57,511 --> 01:30:59,634
Anyone got a view of our friend lan Howe?

1092
01:30:59,722 --> 01:31:01,596
Lan Howe is not at the stern, sir.

1093
01:31:01,682 --> 01:31:04,885
Then why is he heading there?

1094
01:31:04,977 --> 01:31:08,144
He's at the observation deck.

1095
01:31:08,230 --> 01:31:09,310
Sadusky.

1096
01:31:09,732 --> 01:31:11,641
I'm still not against you.

1097
01:31:11,734 --> 01:31:15,566
But I found door number three.
And I'm taking it.

1098
01:31:15,655 --> 01:31:17,694
- What's he talking about?
- Move in!

1099
01:31:17,782 --> 01:31:20,023
Move in! Move in on Gates!

1100
01:31:30,044 --> 01:31:31,040
Divers are a go.

1101
01:31:31,128 --> 01:31:33,833
- Snipers, go to action zebra.
- All teams, move in. Pursue at own risk.

1102
01:31:33,923 --> 01:31:36,675
- I repeat, pursue at own risk.
- You first.

1103
01:31:36,759 --> 01:31:39,332
Holy mackerel. He set us up.

1104
01:32:01,701 --> 01:32:05,449
Agent Dawes, do you have a visual?
Can you see Gates in the water?

1105
01:32:05,538 --> 01:32:08,243
Sir, it's the Hudson. Nothing is visible.

1106
01:32:09,083 --> 01:32:11,076
Smart fish.

1107
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:33,049
Hello, Ben. Welcome to New Jersey.

1108
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,598
- What'd you do with Abigail and Riley?
- Hope these fit.

1109
01:32:36,688 --> 01:32:38,230
We had to guess your sizes.

1110
01:32:38,315 --> 01:32:40,307
I said, what'd you do
with Abigail and Riley?

1111
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,642
He's the only one who could've
told you that line about Edison.

1112
01:32:42,736 --> 01:32:44,693
Did you bring the glasses?

1113
01:32:44,779 --> 01:32:46,606
I don't know.
Tell me what's happening here.

1114
01:32:46,698 --> 01:32:49,271
Ask your girlfriend.

1115
01:32:49,367 --> 01:32:51,823
She's the one calling all the shots now.

1116
01:32:51,911 --> 01:32:54,663
She won't shut up.

1117
01:32:57,959 --> 01:33:00,415
Yeah, hello.

1118
01:33:00,503 --> 01:33:02,792
It's for you.

1119
01:33:03,256 --> 01:33:07,170
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetie. How's your day going?

1120
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:09,336
Uh, interesting, dear.

1121
01:33:09,429 --> 01:33:11,885
So, what, you working with lan now?

1122
01:33:12,515 --> 01:33:16,465
It turns out helping someone escape
from FBI custody is a criminal act.

1123
01:33:16,561 --> 01:33:18,055
And he's the only criminal we knew.

1124
01:33:18,146 --> 01:33:21,100
- So we called him and made a deal.
- Well, you're...

1125
01:33:22,609 --> 01:33:25,278
You're... you're... you're all right, yeah?
I mean you're safe?

1126
01:33:25,362 --> 01:33:27,650
Yeah, we both are.

1127
01:33:27,739 --> 01:33:31,155
Riley's right here, doing
something clever with a computer.

1128
01:33:31,242 --> 01:33:33,318
I'm tracking him through the... Hey!

1129
01:33:33,411 --> 01:33:35,819
I'm tracking you through the GPS
in Shaw's phone.

1130
01:33:35,914 --> 01:33:39,164
They take a turn anywhere we don't want,
we'll know it. So don't worry.

1131
01:33:39,250 --> 01:33:44,755
If lan tries to double-cross us, we can call
the FBI and tell them right where you are.

1132
01:33:44,839 --> 01:33:47,627
- And where to find lan.
- And where is that?

1133
01:33:47,717 --> 01:33:49,924
Right across the street
from where we're hiding,

1134
01:33:50,011 --> 01:33:51,968
at the intersection
of Wall Street and Broadway.

1135
01:33:52,555 --> 01:33:54,928
Well, you figured out the clue.

1136
01:33:55,016 --> 01:33:58,266
Simple. "Heere at the wall."
Wall Street and Broadway.

1137
01:34:01,523 --> 01:34:03,599
Ben, there is a catch.

1138
01:34:03,692 --> 01:34:06,728
We made lan believe
he could have the treasure.

1139
01:34:06,820 --> 01:34:08,777
It was the only way
we could get this far.

1140
01:34:08,863 --> 01:34:11,099
He's here.

1141
01:34:18,492 --> 01:34:20,485
Here we go.

1142
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:26,238
Ben.

1143
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:31,458
You all right? No broken bones?
A jump like that could kill a man.

1144
01:34:31,547 --> 01:34:34,298
Naw, it was cool.
You should try it sometime.

1145
01:34:36,802 --> 01:34:40,586
The Declaration of Independence.
And the meerschaum pipe.

1146
01:34:41,181 --> 01:34:43,174
All yours.

1147
01:34:44,059 --> 01:34:47,475
- That's it?
- That's it.

1148
01:34:47,563 --> 01:34:51,774
I knew you'd keep your promise.
Now, where is it? Where's my treasure?

1149
01:34:51,859 --> 01:34:53,602
It's right here.

1150
01:34:53,694 --> 01:34:56,944
The map said "Heere at the wall",
spelled with two E's.

1151
01:34:57,031 --> 01:34:59,735
Wall Street follows the path
of an actual wall

1152
01:34:59,825 --> 01:35:02,909
that the original Dutch settlers built
as a defence to keep the British out.

1153
01:35:02,995 --> 01:35:07,538
The main gate was located at a street
called De Heere, also two E's.

1154
01:35:07,625 --> 01:35:10,294
Later De Heere Street was renamed
Broadway after the British got in.

1155
01:35:10,377 --> 01:35:12,915
So, "Heere at the wall."

1156
01:35:13,005 --> 01:35:16,421
Broadway, Wall Street.

1157
01:35:16,508 --> 01:35:18,335
Cheerio.

1158
01:35:19,762 --> 01:35:21,422
Just a moment, Ben.

1159
01:35:21,513 --> 01:35:26,306
Lan, if you break our deal, the FBI
will be only a few minutes behind you.

1160
01:35:26,393 --> 01:35:29,311
You might get away, you might not.

1161
01:35:32,816 --> 01:35:35,023
Is that all the map said?

1162
01:35:37,029 --> 01:35:39,187
Every word.

1163
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:43,483
Oh, Ben.

1164
01:35:43,577 --> 01:35:46,827
You know the key
to running a convincing bluff?

1165
01:35:46,914 --> 01:35:50,858
Every once in a while
you've got to be holding all the cards.

1166
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,250
Dad.

1167
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,595
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

1168
01:36:12,684 --> 01:36:16,053
Trinity Church. We have to go
inside Trinity Church.

1169
01:36:19,482 --> 01:36:21,771
Good. Excellent.

1170
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:24,860
Well, why don't you ask Dr Chase
and Riley to join us?

1171
01:36:24,946 --> 01:36:28,113
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

1172
01:36:33,329 --> 01:36:35,820
Are you all right?

1173
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,453
What do you think? I'm a hostage.

1174
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:42,208
Sit. Sit down.

1175
01:36:42,297 --> 01:36:45,416
- Let him go, lan.
- When we find the treasure.

1176
01:36:45,508 --> 01:36:49,837
No, now. Or you can figure out
the clues for yourself.

1177
01:36:49,929 --> 01:36:51,756
Good luck.

1178
01:36:51,848 --> 01:36:53,259
Ben.

1179
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:57,217
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

1180
01:37:05,695 --> 01:37:08,103
Let's have a look at that map.

1181
01:37:44,269 --> 01:37:45,763
It's...

1182
01:37:47,814 --> 01:37:50,484
It's... it's really quite something. It's...

1183
01:37:50,567 --> 01:37:52,939
It really is remarkable. Take a look.

1184
01:37:59,493 --> 01:38:03,537
- "Parkington Lane."
- "Beneath Parkington Lane."

1185
01:38:03,622 --> 01:38:07,620
But why would the map lead us here,
then take us somewhere else?

1186
01:38:07,709 --> 01:38:10,200
- What's the purpose?
- Just another clue.

1187
01:38:10,295 --> 01:38:15,004
Dad. No, you're right. Parkington Lane
has to be here somewhere.

1188
01:38:16,134 --> 01:38:18,756
A street inside the church?

1189
01:38:18,845 --> 01:38:21,419
Not inside. Beneath.

1190
01:38:21,515 --> 01:38:23,554
Beneath the church.

1191
01:38:28,021 --> 01:38:30,512
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

1192
01:38:30,607 --> 01:38:31,722
- I co...
- Come on.

1193
01:38:41,451 --> 01:38:42,862
Look.

1194
01:38:44,288 --> 01:38:48,237
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

1195
01:38:48,333 --> 01:38:53,244
As soon as this guy gets to wherever this
thing ends, he won't need you any more.

1196
01:38:53,338 --> 01:38:54,619
Or... or any of us.

1197
01:38:54,715 --> 01:38:58,499
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favour.

1198
01:38:58,593 --> 01:39:02,508
- How?
- I'm still working on it.

1199
01:39:02,598 --> 01:39:05,717
Well, I guess I better
work on it too, then.

1200
01:39:05,809 --> 01:39:08,514
Hey! Par... Hey, I found it!

1201
01:39:08,604 --> 01:39:10,389
- Him!
- Ben!

1202
01:39:10,933 --> 01:39:12,926
It's a name.

1203
01:39:15,813 --> 01:39:17,556
Parkington Lane.

1204
01:39:17,648 --> 01:39:21,313
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue Lo...

1205
01:39:21,402 --> 01:39:23,691
Hey! Stop!

1206
01:39:38,002 --> 01:39:39,544
Easy.

1207
01:39:43,132 --> 01:39:45,125
Careful no one steps in him.

1208
01:39:45,217 --> 01:39:47,376
All right, put it down.

1209
01:39:54,268 --> 01:39:59,429
OK. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?

1210
01:40:00,399 --> 01:40:04,812
Right. McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

1211
01:40:05,363 --> 01:40:10,653
And if anyone should come out without me,
well... use your imagination.

1212
01:40:13,579 --> 01:40:15,572
Shall we?

1213
01:40:33,307 --> 01:40:36,142
You got a light?

1214
01:40:52,737 --> 01:40:55,109
Careful.

1215
01:40:55,198 --> 01:40:57,440
Watch your step.

1216
01:41:03,248 --> 01:41:05,240
Come here.

1217
01:41:14,593 --> 01:41:16,965
Why does that never happen to me?

1218
01:41:23,018 --> 01:41:25,010
What's this?

1219
01:41:40,493 --> 01:41:42,533
It's a chandelier.

1220
01:41:51,713 --> 01:41:53,041
Here.

1221
01:42:08,980 --> 01:42:11,815
- Wow.
- Look at the elevators.

1222
01:42:11,900 --> 01:42:13,477
A dumbwaiter system.

1223
01:42:13,568 --> 01:42:16,190
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools
build all this?

1224
01:42:16,279 --> 01:42:19,862
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

1225
01:42:19,950 --> 01:42:23,069
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

1226
01:42:23,161 --> 01:42:25,367
Right, let's go. What are we waiting for?

1227
01:42:25,789 --> 01:42:29,946
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

1228
01:42:30,037 --> 01:42:33,038
Dad, do what he says.

1229
01:42:52,351 --> 01:42:54,557
Watch your step.

1230
01:42:56,438 --> 01:42:58,348
We're right under the Trinity graveyard.

1231
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,062
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

1232
01:43:05,781 --> 01:43:07,774
What is that?

1233
01:43:12,162 --> 01:43:14,155
Subway.

1234
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:22,412
Shaw! Oh, God, Shaw!

1235
01:43:33,100 --> 01:43:35,009
Oh, my God.

1236
01:43:39,565 --> 01:43:42,186
Hold on! Hold on!

1237
01:43:44,653 --> 01:43:46,978
OK, get on the elevator. Jump!

1238
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,365
Ben! Grab my hand.

1239
01:43:54,371 --> 01:43:55,996
- Come on.
- Lan!

1240
01:43:56,081 --> 01:43:58,833
Abigail! Get on!

1241
01:44:02,588 --> 01:44:04,545
Jump!

1242
01:44:14,010 --> 01:44:15,125
Here.

1243
01:44:23,353 --> 01:44:25,013
Ben!

1244
01:44:25,772 --> 01:44:28,393
Get down there.
Get down there!

1245
01:44:33,821 --> 01:44:35,481
The Declaration.

1246
01:44:38,701 --> 01:44:40,908
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

1247
01:44:55,051 --> 01:44:56,878
Oh, no! Ben!

1248
01:45:03,101 --> 01:45:05,058
Hang on!

1249
01:45:13,778 --> 01:45:15,272
Son!

1250
01:45:22,328 --> 01:45:26,373
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
I had to save the Declaration.

1251
01:45:26,457 --> 01:45:31,000
No, don't be. I would have done
exactly the same thing to you.

1252
01:45:31,087 --> 01:45:33,210
Really?

1253
01:45:33,298 --> 01:45:36,916
I would have dropped you both.
Freaks.

1254
01:45:44,434 --> 01:45:46,640
Get on.

1255
01:45:46,728 --> 01:45:48,519
Lan...

1256
01:45:48,605 --> 01:45:51,006
it's not worth it.

1257
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:55,763
Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

1258
01:45:55,856 --> 01:45:57,136
We go on.

1259
01:45:58,942 --> 01:46:02,892
The status quo.
Keep the status quo.

1260
01:46:10,621 --> 01:46:13,871
- Now what?
- This is...

1261
01:46:13,957 --> 01:46:16,828
This is where it all leads.

1262
01:46:26,303 --> 01:46:28,296
OK, let's go.

1263
01:47:11,223 --> 01:47:13,761
What is this?

1264
01:47:13,850 --> 01:47:16,258
So where's the treasure?

1265
01:47:19,189 --> 01:47:20,518
Well?

1266
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:24,439
This is it?

1267
01:47:24,528 --> 01:47:26,935
We came all this way
for a dead end?

1268
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:29,648
Yes.

1269
01:47:32,863 --> 01:47:35,699
- There's gotta be something more.
- Riley, there's nothing more.

1270
01:47:35,783 --> 01:47:38,155
- Another clue, or...
- No, there are no more clues!

1271
01:47:38,244 --> 01:47:39,868
That's it, OK? It's over!

1272
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:44,082
End of the road. The treasure's gone.
Moved. Taken somewhere else.

1273
01:47:45,418 --> 01:47:49,367
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Ben? Hm?

1274
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:52,417
You know where it is.

1275
01:47:52,508 --> 01:47:54,252
No.

1276
01:47:57,972 --> 01:48:00,214
OK, go.

1277
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:03,095
Hey, wait a minute.

1278
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:05,719
- Hey! Lan, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait!

1279
01:48:05,813 --> 01:48:07,521
- Lan...
- We'll be trapped.

1280
01:48:07,607 --> 01:48:10,062
- Don't do this.
- You can't just leave us here.

1281
01:48:10,151 --> 01:48:14,065
Yes, I can.
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.

1282
01:48:14,155 --> 01:48:16,397
There isn't another clue.

1283
01:48:16,490 --> 01:48:20,903
Lan, why don't you come back down here
and we can talk through this together?

1284
01:48:20,995 --> 01:48:23,533
- Don't speak again.
- OK.

1285
01:48:24,957 --> 01:48:29,085
The clue. Where's the treasure?

1286
01:48:30,171 --> 01:48:31,285
Ben?

1287
01:48:34,383 --> 01:48:36,376
- The lantern.
- Dad...

1288
01:48:37,845 --> 01:48:40,134
The status quo has changed, son.

1289
01:48:40,222 --> 01:48:41,847
Don't.

1290
01:48:44,852 --> 01:48:48,684
It's part of freemason teachings.

1291
01:48:48,773 --> 01:48:52,189
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

1292
01:48:52,276 --> 01:48:58,231
It signified the journey that had to be made
to find the light of truth.

1293
01:48:58,324 --> 01:49:02,156
- The lantern is the clue.
- And what does it mean?

1294
01:49:02,245 --> 01:49:04,736
Boston. It's Boston.

1295
01:49:04,830 --> 01:49:06,490
The Old North Church in Boston,

1296
01:49:06,582 --> 01:49:10,111
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

1297
01:49:10,205 --> 01:49:14,119
to signal Paul Revere that the British
were coming. One if by land, two if by sea.

1298
01:49:14,209 --> 01:49:19,369
One lantern. Under the winding staircase
of the steeple, that's where we have to look.

1299
01:49:19,464 --> 01:49:22,833
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

1300
01:49:22,926 --> 01:49:26,093
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

1301
01:49:26,179 --> 01:49:29,797
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

1302
01:49:29,891 --> 01:49:32,098
What if we lied?

1303
01:49:32,185 --> 01:49:33,430
Did you?

1304
01:49:33,520 --> 01:49:36,272
What if there's another clue?

1305
01:49:36,356 --> 01:49:38,562
Then I'll know right where to find you.

1306
01:49:40,193 --> 01:49:42,186
See you, Ben.

1307
01:49:44,739 --> 01:49:46,483
- No!
- There's no other way out!

1308
01:49:46,575 --> 01:49:48,614
- Come back!
- You're gonna need us, lan!

1309
01:49:49,619 --> 01:49:51,991
We're all gonna die.

1310
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:56,125
It's gonna be OK, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

1311
01:49:56,209 --> 01:49:58,285
It's OK, kiddo.

1312
01:49:58,378 --> 01:50:04,048
OK, boys, what's going on? The British
came by sea. It was two lanterns, not one.

1313
01:50:04,134 --> 01:50:07,254
Lan needed another clue,
so we gave it to him.

1314
01:50:07,345 --> 01:50:10,263
It was a fake.
It was a fake clue.

1315
01:50:10,348 --> 01:50:12,886
The all-seeing eye.

1316
01:50:12,976 --> 01:50:15,467
"Through the all-seeing eye."

1317
01:50:16,229 --> 01:50:19,230
That means... by the time lan
figures it out and comes back here,

1318
01:50:19,316 --> 01:50:23,016
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

1319
01:50:23,570 --> 01:50:26,239
Either way, we're gonna die.

1320
01:50:27,032 --> 01:50:30,365
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

1321
01:50:30,911 --> 01:50:31,990
Where?

1322
01:50:32,078 --> 01:50:34,652
Through the treasure room.

1323
01:50:41,463 --> 01:50:43,455
Here.

1324
01:50:53,219 --> 01:50:54,962
Riley.

1325
01:51:21,580 --> 01:51:25,032
Looks like someone got here first.

1326
01:51:26,252 --> 01:51:28,825
I'm sorry, Ben.

1327
01:51:28,921 --> 01:51:30,748
It's gone.

1328
01:51:33,217 --> 01:51:35,922
- Listen, Ben...
- It may have even been gone

1329
01:51:36,011 --> 01:51:39,879
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

1330
01:51:41,100 --> 01:51:43,223
It doesn't matter.

1331
01:51:43,310 --> 01:51:46,264
I know. Cos you were right.

1332
01:51:46,355 --> 01:51:49,226
No, I wasn't right.

1333
01:51:49,316 --> 01:51:51,986
This room is real, Ben.

1334
01:51:52,069 --> 01:51:54,394
And that means the treasure is real.

1335
01:51:54,905 --> 01:51:57,692
We're in the company of
some of the most brilliant minds in history,

1336
01:51:57,783 --> 01:52:01,615
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

1337
01:52:01,704 --> 01:52:04,277
and understood the meaning of it.

1338
01:52:04,373 --> 01:52:07,290
You did it, Ben. For all of us.

1339
01:52:08,294 --> 01:52:11,627
Your grandfather, and all of us.

1340
01:52:12,089 --> 01:52:16,087
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

1341
01:52:26,478 --> 01:52:28,601
I just...

1342
01:52:28,689 --> 01:52:31,767
really thought
I was gonna find the treasure.

1343
01:52:33,730 --> 01:52:35,639
OK.

1344
01:52:35,732 --> 01:52:38,483
Then we just keep looking for it.

1345
01:52:41,779 --> 01:52:43,772
I'm in.

1346
01:52:48,494 --> 01:52:50,286
OK.

1347
01:52:51,915 --> 01:52:55,034
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

1348
01:52:55,126 --> 01:52:58,460
Because as far as I can see,
we're still trapped down here.

1349
01:52:58,546 --> 01:53:00,254
Yeah.

1350
01:53:01,132 --> 01:53:03,006
Now, Ben,
where is this other way out?

1351
01:53:03,092 --> 01:53:05,168
Well, that's it.
It doesn't make any sense,

1352
01:53:05,261 --> 01:53:08,464
because the first thing the builders
would have done after getting down here

1353
01:53:08,556 --> 01:53:11,593
was cut a secondary shaft back out for air...

1354
01:53:11,684 --> 01:53:14,804
- Right.
...and in case of cave-ins.

1355
01:53:37,043 --> 01:53:40,163
Could it really be that simple?

1356
01:53:44,634 --> 01:53:46,792
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

1357
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:17,761
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.

1358
01:55:19,890 --> 01:55:21,764
Could this be possible?

1359
01:55:41,286 --> 01:55:46,328
It's a big... bluish-green man,

1360
01:55:46,416 --> 01:55:49,287
with a strange-looking goatee.

1361
01:55:49,378 --> 01:55:52,159
I'm guessing that's significant.

1362
01:56:41,549 --> 01:56:42,545
Yes!

1363
01:56:54,312 --> 01:56:57,063
Riley, are you crying?

1364
01:56:57,148 --> 01:56:59,187
Look.

1365
01:56:59,275 --> 01:57:01,433
Stairs.

1366
01:57:17,752 --> 01:57:19,791
Hi.

1367
01:57:19,879 --> 01:57:22,121
Do you have a cell phone I could borrow?

1368
01:57:35,013 --> 01:57:38,014
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

1369
01:57:38,099 --> 01:57:41,385
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

1370
01:57:41,478 --> 01:57:44,763
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

1371
01:57:44,856 --> 01:57:46,564
Not to me.

1372
01:57:46,650 --> 01:57:48,393
Have a seat.

1373
01:57:48,860 --> 01:57:51,232
So what's your offer?

1374
01:57:51,821 --> 01:57:54,739
How about a bribe? Say...

1375
01:57:55,742 --> 01:57:59,028
ten billion dollars?

1376
01:57:59,120 --> 01:58:00,745
I take it you found the treasure?

1377
01:58:00,830 --> 01:58:03,452
It's about five stories
beneath your shoes.

1378
01:58:07,254 --> 01:58:09,377
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

1379
01:58:09,464 --> 01:58:14,173
that the treasure was too great
for any one man to have, not even a king.

1380
01:58:14,261 --> 01:58:18,009
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

1381
01:58:18,098 --> 01:58:20,470
That's right.

1382
01:58:20,559 --> 01:58:24,093
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

1383
01:58:24,187 --> 01:58:27,473
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

1384
01:58:27,941 --> 01:58:29,020
Give it to the people.

1385
01:58:29,109 --> 01:58:34,186
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre, the Cairo museum...

1386
01:58:34,281 --> 01:58:37,400
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

1387
01:58:37,492 --> 01:58:41,905
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

1388
01:58:41,997 --> 01:58:45,697
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

1389
01:58:46,334 --> 01:58:50,961
OK, here's what I want.
Dr Chase gets off completely clean,

1390
01:58:51,047 --> 01:58:53,170
not even a little Post-it
on her service record.

1391
01:58:53,258 --> 01:58:54,123
OK.

1392
01:58:54,217 --> 01:59:00,386
I want the credit for the find
to go to the entire Gates family,

1393
01:59:00,473 --> 01:59:03,261
with the assistance of Mr Riley Poole.

1394
01:59:03,351 --> 01:59:05,677
And what about you?

1395
01:59:05,770 --> 01:59:07,810
I'd really love not to go to prison.

1396
01:59:07,898 --> 01:59:12,850
I can't even begin to describe
how much I would love not to go to prison.

1397
01:59:14,064 --> 01:59:17,149
Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.

1398
01:59:17,234 --> 01:59:22,442
Well, if you've got a helicopter,
I think I can help with that.

1399
01:59:30,873 --> 01:59:33,198
Freeze! FBI!

1400
01:59:35,336 --> 01:59:37,542
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

1401
01:59:39,381 --> 01:59:42,881
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.

1402
01:59:46,513 --> 01:59:48,387
You're under arrest, Mr Howe.

1403
01:59:48,474 --> 01:59:51,843
We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder...

1404
01:59:51,936 --> 01:59:54,937
and trespassing on government property.

1405
02:00:03,280 --> 02:00:06,067
Yeah. You got it, chief.
Thank you. Bye.

1406
02:00:07,243 --> 02:00:10,243
They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

1407
02:00:10,329 --> 02:00:12,203
They're sending a private jet.

1408
02:00:12,289 --> 02:00:13,487
That's fun.

1409
02:00:13,582 --> 02:00:17,414
Yeah, big whoop. We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

1410
02:00:17,503 --> 02:00:20,670
Ten per cent, Ben. They offered you
ten per cent and you turned it down.

1411
02:00:20,756 --> 02:00:24,207
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

1412
02:00:24,301 --> 02:00:28,465
I still have this splinter that's been festering
for three months from an old piece of wood.

1413
02:00:28,556 --> 02:00:29,587
OK, I'll tell you what.

1414
02:00:29,682 --> 02:00:33,514
Next time we find a treasure
that redefines history for all mankind,

1415
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:35,595
you make the call on the finder's fee.

1416
02:00:35,688 --> 02:00:38,143
That's not as funny.

1417
02:00:38,232 --> 02:00:40,271
What do you care?
You got the girl.

1418
02:00:41,277 --> 02:00:42,985
- It's true.
- It's true.

1419
02:00:46,407 --> 02:00:48,530
Rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils...

1420
02:00:48,617 --> 02:00:51,102
while I sit on one per cent.

1421
02:00:52,699 --> 02:00:55,569
One stinkin' per cent.
Half of one per cent, actually.

1422
02:00:56,119 --> 02:00:58,526
One per cent. Unbelievable.

1423
02:00:58,621 --> 02:01:00,614
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.

1424
02:01:00,707 --> 02:01:05,084
For the record, Ben,
I like the house.

1425
02:01:05,169 --> 02:01:08,585
You know, I chose this estate
because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...

1426
02:01:08,673 --> 02:01:13,465
Yeah, someone that did something
in history and had fun. Great. Wonderful.

1427
02:01:13,553 --> 02:01:15,296
Could have had a bigger house.

1428
02:01:24,063 --> 02:01:27,764
- I made something for you.
- You did? What?

1429
02:01:27,859 --> 02:01:29,851
- A map.
- A map?

1430
02:01:31,362 --> 02:01:33,272
Where does it lead to?

1431
02:01:33,364 --> 02:01:36,235
You'll figure it out.
