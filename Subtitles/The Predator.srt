00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,341
<i>Picket One, copy.</i>

4
00:02:31,343 --> 00:02:32,977
<i>Do you got eyes
on the hostages?</i>

5
00:02:33,244 --> 00:02:34,445
Still negative.

6
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:37,082
<i>20 bucks
says they don't show.</i>

7
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,880
You two morons
really making bets

8
00:02:38,882 --> 00:02:41,718
on whether a drug cartel
has executed these hostages?

9
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:42,840
<i>Abso-fucking-lutely.</i>

10
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,286
<i>I believe
that was implied. Yeah.</i>

11
00:02:44,288 --> 00:02:46,090
Just checking. I'm in for 20.

12
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,612
I got two hostages.

13
00:03:12,383 --> 00:03:13,719
No crosswind.

14
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:17,089
I'm not waiting. 10-50, out.

15
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,835
Bluebill Two,
are you out there?

16
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:06,572
Over.

17
00:05:13,738 --> 00:05:14,973
Goddamn it!

18
00:05:17,041 --> 00:05:18,342
Dupree, Jesus!

19
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:21,142
Where's Haines?

20
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:23,147
Don't know.
Comm's not fucking working.

21
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,283
Give me the pack.

22
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:31,953
It's evidence.

23
00:05:31,955 --> 00:05:34,058
Ain't nobody
gonna believe this one.

24
00:05:39,397 --> 00:05:40,966
The fuck is that, Cap?

25
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,368
It's above our pay grade.

26
00:05:45,536 --> 00:05:47,839
Haines! Come in. Over.

27
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,945
Haines, goddamn it,
come in. Over!

28
00:05:56,947 --> 00:05:57,983
Sir?

29
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,683
The fuck is that, Cap?

30
00:06:01,685 --> 00:06:02,784
The fuck is that, Cap?

31
00:06:02,786 --> 00:06:04,356
Comm's not fucking working.

32
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:14,933
Haines?

33
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:19,137
Light it up!

34
00:08:10,014 --> 00:08:12,016
Gentlemen, remember...

35
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:13,884
they're large, they're fast,

36
00:08:14,185 --> 00:08:16,421
and fucking you up's
their idea of tourism!

37
00:08:17,255 --> 00:08:18,255
Go!

38
00:08:18,455 --> 00:08:19,890
Eyes up! Come on!

39
00:08:20,425 --> 00:08:22,623
I want the passenger.
I want the pod.

40
00:08:22,625 --> 00:08:23,592
If it's not from here...

41
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:24,963
- You want it.
- ...I want it.

42
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,389
I need help.

43
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:54,289
And I have money.

44
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:56,693
Why should I help
a man with a gun, eh?

45
00:08:58,595 --> 00:08:59,597
All right.

46
00:09:17,147 --> 00:09:19,715
I need you
to mail this for me.

47
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,651
You send it to this address.

48
00:09:21,951 --> 00:09:25,022
Mail what's in the pack,
not the backpack.

49
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:26,490
<i>Ahora.</i> Go!

50
00:09:34,599 --> 00:09:35,633
Okay.

51
00:09:44,342 --> 00:09:45,573
Back up!

52
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:47,342
It was so amazing!

53
00:09:47,344 --> 00:09:48,579
Yeah, it was.

54
00:09:50,915 --> 00:09:52,117
Bye, Mom!

55
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:22,544
- Do it, man.
- No, you do it.

56
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:23,580
Okay.

57
00:10:24,214 --> 00:10:25,880
Do it.

58
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:43,667
Oh, shit.

59
00:10:45,136 --> 00:10:47,202
Looky, looky, loo.

60
00:10:47,204 --> 00:10:48,904
Hey, EJ, you hungry?

61
00:10:48,906 --> 00:10:51,506
I'm hungry for an ass-burger.

62
00:10:51,508 --> 00:10:52,810
Mmm. Sounds delicious.

63
00:10:53,076 --> 00:10:55,244
A nice, big, juicy ass-burger.

64
00:10:55,246 --> 00:10:57,515
Oh, yeah.

65
00:10:59,483 --> 00:11:01,051
The hell are you doing?

66
00:11:02,185 --> 00:11:04,288
- He's a goner.
- All right.

67
00:12:22,999 --> 00:12:24,034
Hi, there.

68
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:26,570
Does, uh, Quinn McKenna
live here?

69
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,773
His post office box payments
are past due.

70
00:12:31,608 --> 00:12:32,843
Department of Defense.

71
00:12:33,477 --> 00:12:35,313
He works for the government,
does he?

72
00:12:35,945 --> 00:12:38,749
MOS-1-1-B-3-V-W-3.

73
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,018
Military designation.

74
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,720
- Ah.
- He kills people...

75
00:12:45,156 --> 00:12:46,657
so you can be a mailman.

76
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:01,439
Dr. Brackett?

77
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:11,483
I understand
you enjoy stargazing?

78
00:13:14,118 --> 00:13:15,550
My men
will take care of your dog.

79
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,887
Will you come with me, please?

80
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,700
What am I looking at?

81
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:33,537
It's exactly
what you think it is. Yeah.

82
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,773
They've been here before.

83
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,911
'87. '97.

84
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,717
Lately, the visits
are increasing in frequency.

85
00:13:56,326 --> 00:13:59,596
Rory, I'm home!
Hey, I got you something.

86
00:14:00,765 --> 00:14:01,766
Hey.

87
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,371
Did you do
one of these after school?

88
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:08,873
I did all of them.

89
00:14:09,706 --> 00:14:11,374
Oh. Okay.

90
00:14:11,941 --> 00:14:15,345
Well, I got you two options.

91
00:14:16,513 --> 00:14:17,614
We have...

92
00:14:18,282 --> 00:14:20,450
pirate, or...

93
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,854
Frankenstein.

94
00:14:26,256 --> 00:14:28,059
Frankenstein,
you know, green skin?

95
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,594
Threw a girl
to see if she would float?

96
00:14:32,696 --> 00:14:33,627
No. Okay.

97
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:36,200
Well, let's go with pirate.
Yeah?

98
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,734
This is dumb.

99
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,805
The guys will...

100
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:43,340
They will still
be able to see.

101
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:45,676
See what?

102
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:47,678
That it's me.

103
00:14:49,946 --> 00:14:52,215
You were once
quoted as saying,

104
00:14:52,416 --> 00:14:54,484
"I dropped
from my mother's womb...

105
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,487
I hit the floor...

106
00:14:56,853 --> 00:14:57,952
and I started crawling

107
00:14:57,954 --> 00:15:00,755
through hostile territory
toward my grave."

108
00:15:02,892 --> 00:15:03,792
<i>About right, yeah.</i>

109
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:06,062
- That's badass.
- It's pretty morbid.

110
00:15:06,064 --> 00:15:07,332
It's pretty dark.

111
00:15:07,998 --> 00:15:10,598
What's with the polygraph?

112
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,034
I thought
this was a psych eval.

113
00:15:12,335 --> 00:15:14,437
We need to know
if you pose a threat.

114
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:15,772
Oh, I'm a sniper.

115
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,709
Isn't posing a threat
kind of the fucking point?

116
00:15:19,377 --> 00:15:22,613
You spend most of your time
now in-country...

117
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:24,916
estranged from your wife
and son?

118
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:32,189
Look, I get it.

119
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:36,191
Something went down in Mexico
and nobody wants any witnesses.

120
00:15:36,193 --> 00:15:37,193
Excuse me?

121
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:39,863
You're not here
to find out if I'm crazy.

122
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:42,496
You wanna make sure
the label sticks.

123
00:15:42,498 --> 00:15:44,067
So, you feel
you're being railroaded?

124
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,704
I can see the tracks
on the floor!

125
00:15:48,039 --> 00:15:50,040
I don't see tracks
on the floor, for the record.

126
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:51,840
You feel
like you're a stranger

127
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:53,578
on your own planet,
don't you, Captain?

128
00:15:55,146 --> 00:15:57,448
Like an alien, you mean?

129
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,387
That's what you wanted.

130
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:06,023
<i>Do I get a cookie now?</i>

131
00:16:06,824 --> 00:16:07,990
He saw something.

132
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:09,294
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

133
00:16:54,772 --> 00:16:56,074
Wow!

134
00:17:08,818 --> 00:17:09,886
Ow.

135
00:17:40,784 --> 00:17:43,121
You shove me again,
I'm gonna break your neck.

136
00:17:43,988 --> 00:17:45,456
Did I say that out loud?

137
00:17:49,594 --> 00:17:51,429
McKenna.

138
00:17:54,131 --> 00:17:55,264
Last one.

139
00:17:55,266 --> 00:17:56,868
Thanks for your kindness.
Thank you.

140
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:15,719
Oh, yeah?

141
00:18:23,126 --> 00:18:24,192
You all right over there?

142
00:18:24,194 --> 00:18:26,026
No, don't worry about him.
He's just got Tourettes.

143
00:18:26,028 --> 00:18:28,228
- He can't control it.
- Fuck you, Coyle.

144
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,767
You get used to it, bro.

145
00:18:35,038 --> 00:18:36,571
Welcome to Group Two.

146
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,140
Oh, yeah? What's that?

147
00:18:38,142 --> 00:18:39,274
Like a unit?

148
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:40,978
No, group. Group Two.

149
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:42,947
Group therapy, room two.

150
00:18:44,114 --> 00:18:45,313
Oh.

151
00:18:45,315 --> 00:18:47,082
- McKenna.
- Nebraska Williams.

152
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,216
That's your real name?

153
00:18:48,218 --> 00:18:49,253
Gaylord.

154
00:18:49,453 --> 00:18:51,373
- That's a good call, then.
- Yeah, I thought so.

155
00:18:52,722 --> 00:18:54,157
Where did you serve?

156
00:18:54,624 --> 00:18:56,559
Operation
Enduring Freedom, '03.

157
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:00,030
Went for the Taliban,
stayed for the opium.

158
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,336
That's Coyle.
Friendly fire incident.

159
00:19:06,636 --> 00:19:09,506
Got turned around, fired
at one of his own vehicles.

160
00:19:10,473 --> 00:19:11,706
Now, he tells jokes.

161
00:19:12,843 --> 00:19:14,946
That's Lynch.

162
00:19:15,313 --> 00:19:17,782
Got a medal for blowing up
half a mountain in Mosul.

163
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,684
Entropy.

164
00:19:20,317 --> 00:19:21,718
That's my game.

165
00:19:22,151 --> 00:19:23,752
Things like to fall apart

166
00:19:23,754 --> 00:19:25,990
and I... make it happen.

167
00:19:27,157 --> 00:19:28,823
Just... Just like that.

168
00:19:28,825 --> 00:19:31,228
Ooh! Wow! Oh.

169
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:34,130
- Hey.
- Hey. Don't.

170
00:19:36,132 --> 00:19:37,133
Don't.

171
00:19:37,401 --> 00:19:38,535
That's Nettles.

172
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,072
Okay, I'm Nettles.

173
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,005
Did three tours flying Hueys.

174
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,439
He loves his Bible.
Hey, Netty?

175
00:19:45,441 --> 00:19:47,175
Is it end times yet?

176
00:19:47,177 --> 00:19:48,409
Yeah, laugh all you want.

177
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:50,612
But when you're standing at
attention before your Maker...

178
00:19:50,614 --> 00:19:52,647
I always stand at attention
before I make her.

179
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,086
God makes shitty people.

180
00:19:56,819 --> 00:19:57,719
Yeah.

181
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,955
I mean, why do you think
people make war?

182
00:19:59,957 --> 00:20:01,555
Why, Baxley?
Why do we make war?

183
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:03,891
- Come on, Baxley!
- Because fuck-cock-cock!

184
00:20:03,893 --> 00:20:05,893
- Because we fuck cock-cock?
- Yes, we fuck cocks.

185
00:20:05,895 --> 00:20:07,329
That's it,
because we fuck cocks,

186
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:08,565
that's why. We get upset.

187
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:11,234
How'd you snag a ticket
on this shitmobile?

188
00:20:11,768 --> 00:20:13,570
Put a bullet in a CO.

189
00:20:14,404 --> 00:20:15,972
Any particular reason?

190
00:20:17,574 --> 00:20:18,942
He was an asshole.

191
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:43,300
Keep your head down.

192
00:20:51,674 --> 00:20:53,009
Here, throw this on.

193
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:02,920
Is it just your imagination?

194
00:21:03,254 --> 00:21:06,724
Or is this haunted room
actually stretching?

195
00:21:08,191 --> 00:21:09,359
Every fucking time?

196
00:21:11,928 --> 00:21:13,795
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

197
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:17,498
<i>The GRC meeting has been moved
to section 3, room A.</i>

198
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,769
Aha! There you are!

199
00:21:20,836 --> 00:21:23,440
Welcome.
I'm Sean Keyes.

200
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:26,174
Wow. I heard you basically
wrote the book

201
00:21:26,176 --> 00:21:27,542
on evolutionary biology.

202
00:21:27,544 --> 00:21:29,278
Um, I'm sorry, can I just...

203
00:21:29,513 --> 00:21:30,781
Is that...?

204
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:34,986
Oh, my God!

205
00:21:36,452 --> 00:21:39,021
Holy shit.

206
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:41,057
That's alien technology.

207
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,028
This is what
you brought me here to see?

208
00:21:45,629 --> 00:21:47,331
Well, yeah.

209
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:50,801
Can I... Can I see this?
Can I get into this?

210
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,103
Doc.

211
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:53,900
Let's go.

212
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:08,652
<i>- Everything good?
- Yes, sir.</i>

213
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,988
<i>What is it?</i>

214
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,056
<i>Dr. Brackett.</i>

215
00:22:14,557 --> 00:22:16,326
<i>Would you like
to meet a Predator?</i>

216
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,429
<i>Come on.</i>

217
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,402
<i>Please observe</i>

218
00:22:28,404 --> 00:22:30,240
<i>decontamination protocol.</i>

219
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,742
So, how'd they
rope you into this?

220
00:22:33,043 --> 00:22:35,444
I wrote a letter to
the president when I was six.

221
00:22:35,446 --> 00:22:36,777
Told him how much
I loved animals,

222
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:38,459
and that if NASA
ever found a space animal,

223
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:39,815
they should call me.

224
00:22:40,182 --> 00:22:42,918
Couple years ago,
I was put on a short list

225
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,721
for a paper
I wrote on hybrid strains.

226
00:22:44,955 --> 00:22:48,459
Computer cross-referenced
the letter, and... here I am.

227
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,401
Dr. Brackett.

228
00:22:58,468 --> 00:22:59,867
Thanks for coming.

229
00:22:59,869 --> 00:23:01,304
I'm sure you have questions.

230
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:04,175
- Oh. Just two, actually.
- Okay.

231
00:23:04,575 --> 00:23:06,142
Why do you call it
"the Predator"?

232
00:23:06,776 --> 00:23:08,344
It's a nickname.

233
00:23:08,978 --> 00:23:11,748
You know, the data suggests
that it tracks its prey.

234
00:23:11,949 --> 00:23:13,417
Exploits weakness.

235
00:23:13,651 --> 00:23:15,186
Seems to...

236
00:23:15,652 --> 00:23:16,920
well, enjoy it.

237
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:18,253
Like a game.

238
00:23:18,255 --> 00:23:20,487
That's not a predator,
that's a sports hunter.

239
00:23:20,489 --> 00:23:21,590
Sorry?

240
00:23:21,592 --> 00:23:23,624
A predator
kills its prey to survive.

241
00:23:23,626 --> 00:23:27,528
I mean, what you're describing
is more like a bass fisherman.

242
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:29,730
Well, we took a vote.
Predator's cooler, right?

243
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:31,634
- Fuck yeah.
- Fuck yeah.

244
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:33,802
Found his escape pod
in Mexico.

245
00:23:33,804 --> 00:23:35,739
Still looking
for the ship he came in.

246
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,975
He's heavily sedated.

247
00:23:43,646 --> 00:23:45,849
You are
one beautiful motherfucker.

248
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:49,886
I'm gonna guess your second
question is, why are you here?

249
00:23:51,889 --> 00:23:55,159
Our test results yielded
something a little... odd.

250
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:58,461
Is this a joke?

251
00:23:58,996 --> 00:24:01,396
We ran the genome
sequence ten times.

252
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,331
This specimen has...

253
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,099
- Human DNA?
- Yeah.

254
00:24:05,101 --> 00:24:05,902
Yeah.

255
00:24:06,103 --> 00:24:08,903
Look, we know
about spontaneous speciation.

256
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,371
Mostly plants and insects,
but...

257
00:24:10,373 --> 00:24:13,341
But some mammals,
sheep, goats, uh...

258
00:24:13,343 --> 00:24:14,044
Yeah.

259
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:15,909
The red wolf
is known to be a hybrid

260
00:24:15,911 --> 00:24:17,178
between the coyote
and the grey wolf...

261
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,680
Or possibly some form of
recombinant technology...

262
00:24:19,682 --> 00:24:22,118
Guys, guys, guys.
I get it, I get it.

263
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:24,789
You wanna know
if someone fucked an alien?

264
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,125
Yeah.

265
00:24:30,293 --> 00:24:32,861
Okay, it's got some kind of
atmospheric mask,

266
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:33,863
biohelmet, and...

267
00:24:34,198 --> 00:24:36,363
What are these? Like,
some kind of wrist gauntlets?

268
00:24:36,365 --> 00:24:37,401
Exactly.

269
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:40,101
So, where's the helmet
and the other gauntlet?

270
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,305
We've looked, believe me.

271
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,075
Who is this?

272
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:47,678
He made first contact
with the Predator.

273
00:24:47,878 --> 00:24:49,546
Great.
I'd like to talk to him.

274
00:24:50,046 --> 00:24:52,982
Well, he's
being evaluated, so...

275
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,185
Okay.

276
00:24:57,187 --> 00:24:58,686
Well, before
you lobotomize him,

277
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:00,457
I'd like to ask him
a few questions.

278
00:25:03,324 --> 00:25:04,292
<i>We have a request to reroute.</i>

279
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:06,897
Read you
five-by-five. Destination?

280
00:25:07,163 --> 00:25:09,096
<i>Starkweather Dam.
Proceed at once.</i>

281
00:25:09,098 --> 00:25:11,167
<i>You'll be met
by military personnel. Over.</i>

282
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,205
Hey, Baxley!

283
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:15,769
Question for ya.

284
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,104
All right, here we go.

285
00:25:17,106 --> 00:25:19,407
How do you circumcise
a homeless man?

286
00:25:19,409 --> 00:25:20,307
Here it comes.

287
00:25:20,309 --> 00:25:22,243
Kick your mom in the chin.

288
00:25:22,245 --> 00:25:23,978
Fuck your mother...
Fuck your mother...

289
00:25:25,882 --> 00:25:27,948
- Shut the fuck up!
- All right.

290
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,383
You shut the fuck up.

291
00:25:31,121 --> 00:25:33,588
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Y'all going too fucking much.

292
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,792
I just wanna know
who this motherfucker is.

293
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,360
Why are you here?

294
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,963
Come on, man,
this is the loony bus.

295
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:43,698
- Look at this motherfucker.
- Loonies!

296
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,067
Loonies, yeah.

297
00:25:45,302 --> 00:25:46,570
Ah...

298
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:49,403
I had a run-in
with a space alien.

299
00:25:49,405 --> 00:25:51,605
Oh, shit!

300
00:25:53,509 --> 00:25:54,942
- No, let him...
- Okay, that guy wins.

301
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,277
That's the best story
I've ever heard.

302
00:25:56,279 --> 00:25:57,012
Classic story...

303
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,146
That's the winner right there.
Fuckin' hell.

304
00:25:59,148 --> 00:26:01,251
Would you shut the fuck up?

305
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:02,518
Oh.

306
00:26:05,121 --> 00:26:06,657
They want to put a lid on it,

307
00:26:07,725 --> 00:26:09,056
so here I am.

308
00:26:09,058 --> 00:26:10,526
Stuck in Group Two.

309
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:12,662
The sequel to Group One,
only stupider.

310
00:26:13,729 --> 00:26:14,998
Oh, huh.

311
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:19,534
Give this man
a fuckin' cigar.

312
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,601
Shut the fuck up.

313
00:26:20,603 --> 00:26:22,536
"Would you shut the fuck up?"

314
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:27,175
It's a conspiracy.

315
00:26:27,177 --> 00:26:29,613
The goddamn space aliens, huh?

316
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:14,425
What are you
doing down there, Rory?

317
00:27:15,223 --> 00:27:18,359
Uh, just... just playing games.

318
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:20,130
Well,
dinner's getting cold.

319
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:24,934
Major?

320
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,870
Weird-ass bogey, sir.

321
00:27:27,536 --> 00:27:30,373
One second it's on the grid,
the next it's ghosting.

322
00:27:30,707 --> 00:27:32,342
Damn it.

323
00:27:32,709 --> 00:27:34,443
We need something in the air.

324
00:27:34,777 --> 00:27:35,844
Get me NORAD.

325
00:27:36,345 --> 00:27:38,545
I feel like I'm missing
something in the research.

326
00:27:38,547 --> 00:27:40,027
There's something
I'm just not seeing.

327
00:27:40,415 --> 00:27:43,352
Look, if this is
the blood, okay, I think...

328
00:27:43,952 --> 00:27:45,553
can you just tell me
what that is?

329
00:27:45,555 --> 00:27:47,054
Because I was trying

330
00:27:47,056 --> 00:27:48,989
to get into this earlier,
but somebody stopped me.

331
00:27:48,991 --> 00:27:50,524
He gave me the hairy eyeball.

332
00:27:50,526 --> 00:27:52,561
- That guy actually.
- Hold that thought.

333
00:27:52,563 --> 00:27:54,361
Sir, NORAD's reporting
a 202 anomaly

334
00:27:54,363 --> 00:27:55,832
possibly heading
our direction.

335
00:27:56,065 --> 00:27:57,498
Is it coming here?

336
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
God, I hope not.

337
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:08,842
Holy shit!

338
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:15,195
How far away
are we talking about?

339
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,084
<i>Unknown. But it's
definitely heading your way.</i>

340
00:28:17,086 --> 00:28:18,854
<i>Level two alert.</i>

341
00:28:19,088 --> 00:28:21,022
- <i>Level two alert.</i>
- Shit!

342
00:28:21,024 --> 00:28:22,092
Hey, what's happening?

343
00:28:22,292 --> 00:28:24,158
Proximity alert. Bogey's
inbound. Range 200 miles.

344
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,226
Lock it down.

345
00:28:25,228 --> 00:28:27,861
He's awake!
He's awake! He's awake!

346
00:28:27,863 --> 00:28:30,232
Hey!

347
00:28:30,967 --> 00:28:33,034
Hey, hold him down!
Keep him down!

348
00:28:33,036 --> 00:28:34,203
Hold him down!

349
00:28:36,439 --> 00:28:37,439
Oh, shit!

350
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,445
Doc, on me, now!

351
00:28:41,878 --> 00:28:43,514
Move! Move!

352
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,282
Church, Thomas, J.

353
00:29:07,437 --> 00:29:08,439
Move!

354
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:16,110
<i>Please observe</i>

355
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:17,514
<i>decontamination protocol.</i>

356
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,186
<i>Chamber secure.
Remove outer garments.</i>

357
00:29:49,711 --> 00:29:51,278
Church, Thomas, J.

358
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,782
Church, Thomas, J.

359
00:30:20,776 --> 00:30:23,313
<i>Please observe
decontamination protocol.</i>

360
00:31:11,361 --> 00:31:13,160
<i>All personnel, Code Orange.</i>

361
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,294
<i>Code Orange.</i>

362
00:31:14,296 --> 00:31:16,200
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

363
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,469
Sit tight.
There's been a breach.

364
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:21,703
Do you have an estimate?

365
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:23,105
Not right now.

366
00:31:23,539 --> 00:31:24,859
I'll give you cover fire.

367
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,274
Get him out!

368
00:31:26,276 --> 00:31:28,478
Movement, twelve o'clock!

369
00:31:40,723 --> 00:31:42,925
Hey. Hey.

370
00:31:51,133 --> 00:31:52,969
Don't let him get away.

371
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:57,274
Not my space animal.

372
00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:12,388
What the fuck?

373
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,228
Alien.

374
00:32:18,428 --> 00:32:19,796
Your green boy?

375
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:21,430
Yep.

376
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:23,398
Goddamn space aliens.

377
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,532
What? What?

378
00:32:24,534 --> 00:32:26,300
Did you not just
fucking see that, man?

379
00:32:26,302 --> 00:32:27,435
Am I going fucking mad?

380
00:32:27,437 --> 00:32:28,505
- Hey.
- Shut up.

381
00:32:28,805 --> 00:32:30,839
- Take it easy, man.
- I didn't fucking see it.

382
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:31,805
Nettles, be quiet.

383
00:32:31,807 --> 00:32:33,507
Where the fuck is it?
I wanna see it.

384
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:34,509
Hey!

385
00:32:37,514 --> 00:32:39,148
That's the thing
that killed my men.

386
00:32:39,347 --> 00:32:40,916
Yeah, they'll do that.

387
00:32:41,418 --> 00:32:43,686
We gotta get off this thing.
We gotta move.

388
00:32:44,053 --> 00:32:45,889
Brother, it's a bus.

389
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,958
It moves.

390
00:32:52,295 --> 00:32:53,396
Hey, Baxley!

391
00:32:53,863 --> 00:32:55,862
If your mom's vagina
were a video game,

392
00:32:55,864 --> 00:32:58,801
it'd be rated "E"
for "Everyone."

393
00:32:59,201 --> 00:33:00,469
Hey!

394
00:33:01,171 --> 00:33:02,238
Knock it off.

395
00:33:02,471 --> 00:33:03,771
What's the difference between

396
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:06,409
five big black guys
and a joke?

397
00:33:06,976 --> 00:33:09,879
Baxley's mom
can't take a joke.

398
00:33:10,246 --> 00:33:11,547
What, motherfucker!

399
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:15,719
Come on, bitch!

400
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:20,623
Everyone, on the floor,
face down!

401
00:33:21,524 --> 00:33:24,026
Face down! Now!
Come on!

402
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:32,869
Keys!

403
00:33:36,072 --> 00:33:37,407
Gun!

404
00:33:40,709 --> 00:33:42,842
Hey! Nettles! Nettles!
Wait, hey! Hey!

405
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:44,604
You got him, all right?
You got him, brother.

406
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,432
Hey, Nebraska,
you mind, uh, making a detour?

407
00:34:05,434 --> 00:34:06,794
What, for your green boy?

408
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:09,705
I'm a sniper,
just get me close, baby.

409
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,306
- You wanna kill him?
- Oh, yeah!

410
00:34:12,308 --> 00:34:13,607
Why didn't you just
say so, man?

411
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:15,176
You're gonna kill
a fucking alien?

412
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,178
Hey. Hold on.

413
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:20,617
Fuck!

414
00:35:13,102 --> 00:35:15,037
Yo, what the fuck is that?

415
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:57,781
Easy, easy. Hey! Hey!

416
00:36:04,254 --> 00:36:05,518
- Hey.
- Take cover!

417
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,920
Behind the fucking bus!

418
00:36:06,922 --> 00:36:09,290
What are you doing up there?
Come on. Come on, I got you.

419
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,792
- Yep. I got you, lady.
- Okay.

420
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,328
Let's go! Hey.
Come on, come on.

421
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,065
Goddamn it.

422
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:16,596
- Sorry.
- Move!

423
00:36:16,598 --> 00:36:17,834
Damn.

424
00:36:19,134 --> 00:36:20,504
Get to the choppers!

425
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,661
Stargazer, I got eyes
on the woman.

426
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,830
Instructions?

427
00:36:48,832 --> 00:36:50,563
<i>- Eliminate her.</i>
- Hey.

428
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:51,832
<i>Retrieve any contraband.</i>

429
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:53,636
Roger that, Stargazer.

430
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:05,649
That's it, that's it, girl.

431
00:37:06,116 --> 00:37:07,480
Hey, Nebraska!

432
00:37:07,482 --> 00:37:08,785
Got it.

433
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:27,203
Everything okay back there?

434
00:37:31,506 --> 00:37:33,142
You fucking guys.

435
00:38:07,609 --> 00:38:09,243
We found the one place
to hide out

436
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,647
where we don't look crazy.

437
00:38:15,785 --> 00:38:18,451
It's been a long time since
I had a gun in my hand.

438
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:19,722
What's it feel like?

439
00:38:21,189 --> 00:38:22,725
Like a gun.

440
00:38:23,893 --> 00:38:26,129
Hey, you think she's safe
in there with them?

441
00:38:26,962 --> 00:38:27,997
The girl?

442
00:38:28,897 --> 00:38:30,299
They're soldiers, man.

443
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,836
Sleeping ladies? Nah, bro.

444
00:38:35,605 --> 00:38:36,906
Sit down.

445
00:38:41,143 --> 00:38:42,145
Here.

446
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:45,414
It's the end of times, huh?

447
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,885
Worst thing
about the end times...

448
00:38:50,685 --> 00:38:52,221
they never fucking are.

449
00:38:55,024 --> 00:38:56,292
So, um...

450
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,195
did he live?

451
00:38:59,495 --> 00:39:00,529
Say again?

452
00:39:00,863 --> 00:39:03,129
The CO? The asshole you shot,
did he live?

453
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:04,166
Ah.

454
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,369
Yeah. He did.

455
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,238
Yeah, and where is he at now?

456
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:14,007
You're shitting me.

457
00:39:14,009 --> 00:39:15,111
I missed.

458
00:39:16,913 --> 00:39:18,511
Why did you do that?

459
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:20,616
- Miss?
- No, shoot yourself.

460
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:23,018
Doctors asked me
the same thing.

461
00:39:24,853 --> 00:39:27,256
Walked to the hospital with
a bullet in my skull.

462
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:29,893
- Good times.
- Hey.

463
00:39:31,593 --> 00:39:32,961
Should I be worried?

464
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:42,171
Probably.

465
00:39:42,504 --> 00:39:44,170
- There we go.
- Did you get that?

466
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:45,906
- That's too close to her hand.
- Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

467
00:39:45,908 --> 00:39:47,373
But then
she's gonna drop that there.

468
00:39:47,375 --> 00:39:48,544
Guys!

469
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:51,277
What the hell are you doing?
What is all that shit?

470
00:39:51,279 --> 00:39:53,181
We're trying
to make her feel comfortable.

471
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:54,183
Come on.

472
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,748
She's gonna wake up and see

473
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,317
a bunch of motherfuckers.
Come on.

474
00:39:57,319 --> 00:39:58,386
What are you doin'?

475
00:39:58,886 --> 00:40:00,788
Nettles! Nettles!

476
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,156
Move!

477
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,323
Move!

478
00:40:03,325 --> 00:40:04,761
Get out of there!

479
00:40:18,908 --> 00:40:20,243
Morning, sunshine.

480
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,850
I really wish people
would stop calling me that.

481
00:40:28,183 --> 00:40:29,317
Chill, hey!

482
00:40:30,285 --> 00:40:33,254
I told you
she'd grab it. Ten bucks!

483
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,754
Pay up! Whoo!

484
00:40:34,756 --> 00:40:36,757
Fuck it, fuck it.

485
00:40:36,759 --> 00:40:38,725
- Where's my phone?
- You're not gonna need that.

486
00:40:40,161 --> 00:40:42,295
Oh, that's not cool.

487
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:43,299
It's okay.

488
00:40:43,866 --> 00:40:45,235
I said it's okay.

489
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:47,567
Give me the gun.

490
00:40:47,569 --> 00:40:49,372
- Give me the gun.
- No. No.

491
00:40:55,042 --> 00:40:56,710
Oh, she pulled...

492
00:40:56,712 --> 00:40:59,846
Oh! Shit, I told you
she'd pull the trigger!

493
00:40:59,848 --> 00:41:01,080
I should have bet you
that time!

494
00:41:01,082 --> 00:41:02,248
I like her.
I like her.

495
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:03,583
I should have bet you
that time!

496
00:41:03,585 --> 00:41:04,851
- I like her.
- I like her.

497
00:41:04,853 --> 00:41:06,187
I like her. I like her a lot.

498
00:41:06,189 --> 00:41:07,721
Give me that,
ding-dong.

499
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:10,326
Oh, shit! Attagirl.

500
00:41:10,558 --> 00:41:14,028
What? You're a scientist, huh?
What they got you working on?

501
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,966
You're not gonna last a day
out there!

502
00:41:18,966 --> 00:41:20,702
What, you think you're special?

503
00:41:21,169 --> 00:41:23,605
Back at the dam, they were gonna
put a bullet in your head.

504
00:41:24,073 --> 00:41:25,505
They were gonna shoot her?

505
00:41:25,507 --> 00:41:26,509
Yes.

506
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:28,444
Oh, I'm sorry.

507
00:41:28,843 --> 00:41:31,079
Get out of the way.
See you around.

508
00:41:33,149 --> 00:41:34,951
Eat your pussy.

509
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:36,616
Wait, what?

510
00:41:36,618 --> 00:41:37,917
How you doing?

511
00:41:37,919 --> 00:41:39,518
No, you just said,
"Eat your pussy."

512
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,256
Hey...

513
00:41:40,522 --> 00:41:42,121
- How you doing?
- No, you said, "Eat my pussy."

514
00:41:42,123 --> 00:41:43,357
What the fuck
is wrong with him?

515
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:45,091
- I said you're pushy.
- He said you're pushy.

516
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:46,158
No, you said,
"Eat your pussy."

517
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,928
No. I said,
"Sheesh! You're pushy!"

518
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,161
No, you said,
"Eat my pussy."

519
00:41:49,163 --> 00:41:50,663
No, that's what he said,
I heard it.

520
00:41:50,665 --> 00:41:52,498
- He said... pushy.
- What the fuck?

521
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,033
Which is also fucking rude.

522
00:41:54,035 --> 00:41:55,669
He doesn't mean your pussy
in particular.

523
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:57,036
You're insane, right?

524
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:58,571
- Are you fucking insane?
- Probably.

525
00:41:58,573 --> 00:41:59,573
Well, what's it gonna be?

526
00:41:59,774 --> 00:42:01,375
- He's fucking crazy.
- Fuck you, Baxley.

527
00:42:01,377 --> 00:42:02,411
I feel fine.

528
00:42:02,911 --> 00:42:04,247
They were gonna
shoot me?

529
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:05,748
Why?

530
00:42:06,181 --> 00:42:09,953
Uh, maybe 'cause of this?

531
00:42:14,756 --> 00:42:16,225
Well, I guess I'm in.

532
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:19,161
Stay the fuck away from me.

533
00:42:22,564 --> 00:42:23,932
What the fuck is this?

534
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,165
What is this?

535
00:42:26,167 --> 00:42:28,736
- What is that? Like a unicorn?
- A unicorn.

536
00:42:28,738 --> 00:42:30,205
- It's a unicorn.
- A unicorn.

537
00:42:30,439 --> 00:42:31,938
I made a unicorn...

538
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,540
I'm sorry,
it's a piece of shit.

539
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:36,609
So, what's the upside to me
staying here with you guys?

540
00:42:36,611 --> 00:42:38,411
Uh, maybe staying alive?

541
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:39,712
We are soldiers.

542
00:42:39,714 --> 00:42:40,948
We're the good guys, okay?

543
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:42,283
Well, that's debatable.

544
00:42:42,285 --> 00:42:46,554
I read your file.
The guys in Mexico it killed?

545
00:42:46,556 --> 00:42:47,590
They yours?

546
00:42:48,024 --> 00:42:49,623
They're gonna need
a patsy for that.

547
00:42:49,625 --> 00:42:50,760
You're looking at him.

548
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,128
Yeah, I figured.

549
00:42:52,328 --> 00:42:54,828
Ex-sniper with PTSD? That's
actually kind of perfect.

550
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:56,031
How about you telling us

551
00:42:56,265 --> 00:42:58,098
what you were doing
in a secret base.

552
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,169
Surrounded by
trained soldiers. Mercs.

553
00:43:02,437 --> 00:43:06,341
I'm a biologist, and they have
me on call in case there's...

554
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,379
contact.

555
00:43:10,846 --> 00:43:12,045
What did I tell you?

556
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,948
End days. End days.

557
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:15,582
Nettles, if you don't stop
with this Bible shit,

558
00:43:15,584 --> 00:43:16,817
I'm gonna set you on fire.

559
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:18,217
Guys, if we wanna
keep breathing,

560
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:20,020
we need to find this thing.

561
00:43:20,022 --> 00:43:21,290
Expose it.

562
00:43:21,924 --> 00:43:23,426
It's called the Predator.

563
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:25,326
It hunts people for sport.

564
00:43:25,328 --> 00:43:27,761
Technically, that's not
a predator. That's like...

565
00:43:27,763 --> 00:43:28,862
Thank you.

566
00:43:28,864 --> 00:43:30,297
- It's a hunter.
- I said the same thing.

567
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:31,998
A sportsman,
or a hunter, or a fisherman.

568
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,080
Well, look at you...

569
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,602
I was there when it escaped.
It's looking for something.

570
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:37,973
Equipment. Weapons.

571
00:43:40,509 --> 00:43:41,710
I took its gear.

572
00:43:42,777 --> 00:43:43,810
What?

573
00:43:43,812 --> 00:43:45,011
You took something
from the thing?

574
00:43:45,013 --> 00:43:47,049
- What?
- So, I'd have evidence.

575
00:43:48,317 --> 00:43:50,152
I think I know
where it's going.

576
00:44:23,652 --> 00:44:24,754
What?

577
00:44:48,277 --> 00:44:50,112
Oh, hi, honey, you're home.

578
00:44:50,678 --> 00:44:53,346
- I'm looking for a package.
- A package?

579
00:44:53,348 --> 00:44:54,149
Rory!

580
00:44:54,348 --> 00:44:56,116
Hey! This is
not your house anymore!

581
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:57,384
Rory!

582
00:44:57,386 --> 00:45:00,256
Hey, buddy. Where are ya?

583
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:01,956
He's not here.

584
00:45:02,223 --> 00:45:03,692
What do you mean,
he's not here?

585
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,225
Oh, shit!

586
00:45:06,227 --> 00:45:08,161
What? So we
ordered some video games.

587
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:10,163
No! No! No!

588
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,399
The whole fucking reason
I sent it to a P.O. box,

589
00:45:12,401 --> 00:45:14,069
was so
I didn't put you in danger.

590
00:45:14,536 --> 00:45:15,902
Goddamn it,
we need to find him.

591
00:45:15,904 --> 00:45:17,264
Wait, Quinn,
you're scaring me now.

592
00:45:27,183 --> 00:45:28,348
I specifically said

593
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,250
no first-person shooter.
No combat games.

594
00:45:30,252 --> 00:45:32,018
Did you ever think that
maybe he plays them

595
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,118
to connect with his father?

596
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,420
Oh, my God.
We're doing this again.

597
00:45:34,422 --> 00:45:36,325
Hey! Can you
stop taking all my...

598
00:45:38,294 --> 00:45:39,859
Who are these people
in my house?

599
00:45:39,861 --> 00:45:41,995
Emily, loonies.
Loonies, Emily.

600
00:45:41,997 --> 00:45:43,362
Good evening.

601
00:45:43,364 --> 00:45:44,765
Uh, the brushstrokes on this

602
00:45:44,767 --> 00:45:46,567
are really dynamic.
It's a wonderful piece.

603
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,268
Okay, you need
to put that down.

604
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,203
What exactly is she doing
with her right hand?

605
00:45:50,205 --> 00:45:51,638
They're my unit.
They're soldiers.

606
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:54,075
Marines. There's his unit.

607
00:45:54,310 --> 00:45:55,775
Hi. You seem like
a really nice...

608
00:45:55,777 --> 00:45:57,409
Oh, no, don't touch me. No.

609
00:45:57,411 --> 00:45:59,580
Hang on. Back up.
Your unit?

610
00:45:59,582 --> 00:46:01,717
What happened
to Haines and Dupree?

611
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:04,018
They're dead.

612
00:46:04,486 --> 00:46:06,185
And the thing that killed them
is out there looking for Rory.

613
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:07,453
What are you talking about?

614
00:46:07,455 --> 00:46:08,723
There's something out there.

615
00:46:09,457 --> 00:46:11,692
It tore my friends apart.
What is it?

616
00:46:12,828 --> 00:46:14,895
Like, it's a creature.
Seriously, it's not a person.

617
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,897
Like from the Bible.

618
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,498
- Revelations.
- From the Bible?

619
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,699
That's the most ridiculous
thing I've ever heard.

620
00:46:19,701 --> 00:46:20,701
It's a space alien.

621
00:46:21,102 --> 00:46:22,437
Know who Whoopi Goldberg is?

622
00:46:22,672 --> 00:46:24,407
It's like
an alien Whoopi Goldberg.

623
00:46:25,408 --> 00:46:26,542
Oh, shit!

624
00:46:27,009 --> 00:46:28,007
Shit.

625
00:46:28,009 --> 00:46:29,509
I want a grid search.

626
00:46:29,511 --> 00:46:30,578
Three teams.

627
00:46:32,348 --> 00:46:33,348
Hey!

628
00:46:34,082 --> 00:46:36,083
- No.
- No, no, I'm coming with you.

629
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:37,518
No, nix that.

630
00:46:41,823 --> 00:46:43,258
Is there a problem?

631
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:46,259
Thing is, we're
kind of moving targets.

632
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,627
Yeah, in case you haven't
noticed, we're fugitives.

633
00:46:48,629 --> 00:46:50,563
Yeah. Plus, like where are we
gonna get our meds and stuff?

634
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:52,299
I get it. Fine,
stay here and watch TV.

635
00:46:52,301 --> 00:46:55,435
You know what? If you try
to split? Or draw the Feds?

636
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,703
Or if you jeopardize my son

637
00:46:56,705 --> 00:46:59,071
by your half-assed
yardbird bullshit...

638
00:46:59,073 --> 00:47:00,540
I will come back here,
and I will happily

639
00:47:00,542 --> 00:47:02,511
kill every single
fucking one of you.

640
00:47:08,384 --> 00:47:10,419
Come on,
brothers. Let's go.

641
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,323
Seriously?

642
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,259
It's not our fight.

643
00:47:21,096 --> 00:47:22,899
Is your husband
the man I think he is?

644
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,000
Excuse me?

645
00:47:25,734 --> 00:47:27,436
Tell me
about your husband, please?

646
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:31,237
He's a security
counter-sniper.

647
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,707
- Mmm.
- Army Rangers.

648
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:34,875
He supervised

649
00:47:35,011 --> 00:47:37,844
23 close precision engagements
across five continents

650
00:47:37,846 --> 00:47:40,114
and he has 13 confirmed kills.

651
00:47:40,549 --> 00:47:43,415
And he is one of only 14
captains in the armed forces,

652
00:47:43,417 --> 00:47:45,317
to ever receive
a Distinguished Service Medal

653
00:47:45,319 --> 00:47:46,622
and the Silver Star.

654
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,321
So, he might be
a lousy husband,

655
00:47:49,323 --> 00:47:50,892
but he is a good soldier.

656
00:47:52,794 --> 00:47:55,895
Well, sounds like he can
probably take care of himself.

657
00:47:55,897 --> 00:47:57,330
- Yeah.
- Jesus Christ.

658
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,634
That's what I thought.

659
00:47:59,602 --> 00:48:00,770
Fucking pussies.

660
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,674
Where you going, Nettles?

661
00:48:07,442 --> 00:48:10,044
I didn't like your speech.
It didn't really inspire me.

662
00:48:10,611 --> 00:48:13,513
But... he called me a pussy

663
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:15,515
and nobody
calls me a pussy, so...

664
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,150
- Fuck off, pussy.
- Okay...

665
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:23,357
Come on, Bax, let's go.
Let's get some.

666
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:25,895
Before these army fuckers
screw up the whole thing.

667
00:48:30,165 --> 00:48:31,531
Come on, what are you doing?
Let's move.

668
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,332
Hey!

669
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:33,400
You too, lucky charms.

670
00:48:33,402 --> 00:48:34,670
Coyle, you wanker.

671
00:48:36,906 --> 00:48:38,138
I'd like to watch TV

672
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:39,438
- with you sometime.
- Okay.

673
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,574
I liked your speech.

674
00:48:40,576 --> 00:48:41,978
I liked the couch.

675
00:48:44,011 --> 00:48:45,948
Whoa, what's happening? What?

676
00:48:46,448 --> 00:48:48,716
Well, we're finding my son,
that's what.

677
00:48:49,417 --> 00:48:51,118
All right,
when all this is over...

678
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:53,219
Fuck me in the face
with an aardvark.

679
00:48:56,325 --> 00:48:57,458
I just want to be famous.

680
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,460
Ostensibly,

681
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,993
if Forrest Gump
just read the side of the box,

682
00:48:59,995 --> 00:49:01,694
it would tell him exactly
what he would get.

683
00:49:01,696 --> 00:49:03,330
You're using
"ostensibly" incorrectly.

684
00:49:03,332 --> 00:49:04,431
Is this for me?

685
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:06,034
This is like the reverse
of a clown car.

686
00:49:06,368 --> 00:49:07,467
All right, Nebraska,

687
00:49:07,469 --> 00:49:08,902
let's find some wheels,
nothing flashy.

688
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:09,969
Copy.

689
00:49:09,971 --> 00:49:12,741
All right. Find my son.

690
00:49:12,973 --> 00:49:14,509
Casey, you're with me.

691
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,978
Let's go.

692
00:49:17,145 --> 00:49:18,613
Hey, ass-burger.

693
00:49:22,017 --> 00:49:23,415
What are you supposed to be?

694
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:24,486
Leave me alone.

695
00:49:24,786 --> 00:49:27,786
Or what? You'll wash our
hands five hundred times?

696
00:49:31,158 --> 00:49:32,627
Trick or treat?

697
00:49:37,531 --> 00:49:39,066
What's the matter, dude?

698
00:49:40,535 --> 00:49:42,437
Here's a treat,
you little shit.

699
00:49:42,805 --> 00:49:43,973
Oh!

700
00:50:20,274 --> 00:50:21,940
<i>I got a male juvenile.</i>

701
00:50:21,942 --> 00:50:23,408
<i>10 to 12 years old.</i>

702
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:24,643
<i>Metal cast on his arm.</i>

703
00:50:24,645 --> 00:50:25,779
Yo, McKenna, do you hear that?

704
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:27,483
<i>Ran right in front of my car.</i>

705
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:29,415
<i>Moving east on Woodruff.</i>

706
00:50:29,417 --> 00:50:31,687
<i>Repeat, moving
east on Woodruff.</i>

707
00:50:40,027 --> 00:50:41,694
Nebraska, you got wheels?

708
00:50:41,696 --> 00:50:43,832
<i>Yeah, I got wheels.
Something flashy.</i>

709
00:50:45,299 --> 00:50:47,801
Listen, the kid's spooked,
he's rabbiting.

710
00:50:47,803 --> 00:50:50,772
Where's he headed?
Where's some place he knows?

711
00:51:45,993 --> 00:51:46,995
There he is.

712
00:51:53,134 --> 00:51:54,203
Dad!

713
00:51:58,040 --> 00:51:59,973
How you doing, buddy, huh?

714
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,009
I'm good.

715
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:14,457
Move! Move!

716
00:52:15,223 --> 00:52:17,026
Hey, Doc, come get my kid.

717
00:52:22,864 --> 00:52:24,767
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Come on!

718
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,869
Oh, shit!

719
00:52:36,245 --> 00:52:37,310
McKenna!

720
00:52:40,348 --> 00:52:42,214
Take cover!
Take cover!

721
00:53:01,437 --> 00:53:03,136
Williams!
Get the fuck out of there!

722
00:53:04,772 --> 00:53:06,908
What are you doing?
Get out of there!

723
00:53:07,375 --> 00:53:08,709
Oh, shit!

724
00:53:13,147 --> 00:53:14,616
Oh. Okay.

725
00:53:23,292 --> 00:53:25,991
Doc, the dreads.
What's that all about?

726
00:53:25,993 --> 00:53:28,661
I don't know.
Maybe, like, sensor receptors.

727
00:53:28,663 --> 00:53:29,998
Kind of like cat whiskers.

728
00:53:30,732 --> 00:53:32,866
Whoa! What the...
I'm getting a sample.

729
00:53:32,868 --> 00:53:34,303
It's a fucking space dog.

730
00:53:35,671 --> 00:53:36,906
You okay? Huh?

731
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,241
What, is your mom
cutting your hair now?

732
00:53:41,243 --> 00:53:42,403
You kidding me?
This is

733
00:53:42,444 --> 00:53:43,777
- a once-in-a-lifetime moment.
- Shut up. Please shut up.

734
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:44,978
All I wanted
was a little sample.

735
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,681
Please shut up.

736
00:53:45,913 --> 00:53:47,080
All I wanted was
a goddamn fucking sample.

737
00:53:47,082 --> 00:53:48,083
Come here.

738
00:53:51,285 --> 00:53:52,351
Sample.

739
00:53:52,353 --> 00:53:53,420
- There you go.
- Thank you.

740
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:55,020
- You're welcome.
- Fucking space dog, man.

741
00:53:55,022 --> 00:53:56,522
- My man, you need to...
- It's a fucking...

742
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,656
I can't. I can't.

743
00:53:57,658 --> 00:53:59,561
- Get it together.
- I can't do this.

744
00:54:00,227 --> 00:54:01,563
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa!

745
00:54:02,163 --> 00:54:03,631
Fucking hell!

746
00:54:07,234 --> 00:54:09,037
Fuck!

747
00:54:09,638 --> 00:54:11,906
Go now! Please!

748
00:54:12,274 --> 00:54:13,275
Rory!

749
00:54:14,509 --> 00:54:16,945
Shoot him! Shoot him!

750
00:54:17,145 --> 00:54:19,181
Hey!
No! No! No!

751
00:54:20,482 --> 00:54:21,917
No! No! No!

752
00:54:24,285 --> 00:54:27,121
Oh, fuck, fuck. No, no, no!

753
00:54:28,756 --> 00:54:30,190
Cock! Cock! Fuck! Dick!

754
00:54:30,192 --> 00:54:32,692
Suck! Suck my cock!
Fuck! Goddamn it!

755
00:54:34,196 --> 00:54:35,527
Go! Go! Go!

756
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:36,728
I got him! I got him!

757
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,067
Go, go, go!
On Williams! On Williams!

758
00:54:40,602 --> 00:54:41,804
Rory!

759
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,977
- Take cover!
- Move!

760
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:52,379
Go! Go!

761
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:53,446
Come on!

762
00:54:53,448 --> 00:54:54,683
Come on!

763
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,783
FYI, back at Stargazer,

764
00:54:57,785 --> 00:55:00,085
I was naked and unarmed,
it walked right past me.

765
00:55:00,087 --> 00:55:02,825
Can you tell your kid to tone
down the psychosis, please?

766
00:55:07,495 --> 00:55:09,629
All right, let's do this.
Let's do this.

767
00:55:09,631 --> 00:55:10,631
Wait, and do what?

768
00:55:11,031 --> 00:55:12,098
You know,
we could keep running,

769
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,699
or we give him back
what he wants.

770
00:55:18,506 --> 00:55:20,142
What, this is it?

771
00:55:23,178 --> 00:55:24,611
Oh, my God. Shit.

772
00:55:30,252 --> 00:55:31,317
Shit.

773
00:55:31,319 --> 00:55:33,118
No, no, no! Move! Move! Move!

774
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:34,122
Hey, come on.

775
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:35,453
You good?

776
00:55:35,455 --> 00:55:36,455
Fucked!

777
00:55:36,591 --> 00:55:37,656
Let's get
the fuck out of here.

778
00:55:37,658 --> 00:55:38,792
Netty, get the vehicle.

779
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,460
- The rest of you on me.
- Copy.

780
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,864
Move back.

781
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,277
No! No! No!

782
00:55:58,279 --> 00:55:59,281
No!

783
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:16,998
Incoming!

784
00:56:20,201 --> 00:56:21,402
What the fuck?

785
00:56:51,165 --> 00:56:53,501
Come here!
Roll out! Roll out, let's go!

786
00:56:53,768 --> 00:56:55,203
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

787
00:56:55,569 --> 00:56:57,105
- Move!
- Move out, move out!

788
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:01,176
Move! Move out!

789
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:03,479
- Let's go!
- Let's move!

790
00:57:05,413 --> 00:57:07,013
Go, go, go! Let's go!

791
00:57:07,015 --> 00:57:08,183
Let's go!

792
00:57:08,482 --> 00:57:09,582
Move!

793
00:57:09,584 --> 00:57:10,850
Come on!

794
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:12,819
Move! Come on,
get in! Come on!

795
00:57:12,821 --> 00:57:14,254
Sit down!

796
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:16,524
Good! Good! Good!

797
00:57:19,627 --> 00:57:20,995
Go! Last man!

798
00:57:22,163 --> 00:57:23,165
Go! Go! Go!

799
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:42,047
What's the big one?

800
00:57:42,049 --> 00:57:43,951
What's the big one, Doc?
Is that like the male?

801
00:57:44,185 --> 00:57:45,784
He didn't even
give a shit about us.

802
00:57:45,786 --> 00:57:47,055
Just wanted
to kill that thing.

803
00:57:50,459 --> 00:57:52,024
You saw that, right?

804
00:57:52,026 --> 00:57:54,393
Guys! Did you see that? He...

805
00:57:54,395 --> 00:57:57,166
He grew an exoskeleton
under his fucking skin.

806
00:57:59,667 --> 00:58:01,370
What, are they hunting
each other now?

807
00:58:34,502 --> 00:58:36,571
We're still sorting
through it right now.

808
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:47,080
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>
- Tell me he's okay.

809
00:58:47,082 --> 00:58:48,880
He's fine.
I'm going to bring him back.

810
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:50,082
It's okay, don't say anything,
just be safe.

811
00:58:50,084 --> 00:58:52,020
Hey, no! Don't do that!

812
00:58:52,252 --> 00:58:54,957
What? Hello?

813
00:58:59,328 --> 00:59:00,393
Damn it.

814
00:59:00,395 --> 00:59:02,564
You guys fucked
with the wrong family.

815
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,766
- How tall?
- Witnesses say 11 feet.

816
00:59:07,768 --> 00:59:09,303
That's
pretty fucking tall.

817
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:10,605
Okay.

818
00:59:13,774 --> 00:59:15,943
- Fucked that nigga up.
- Sir?

819
00:59:16,743 --> 00:59:18,012
Nothing.

820
00:59:19,647 --> 00:59:21,149
I'd be careful with that, sir.

821
00:59:23,049 --> 00:59:24,250
You know what I think?

822
00:59:24,252 --> 00:59:26,687
I think this one
went rogue. A runner.

823
00:59:26,953 --> 00:59:28,554
Hmm. And the big one?

824
00:59:28,556 --> 00:59:29,721
He's a tracker.

825
00:59:29,723 --> 00:59:30,959
Sent to take that one out.

826
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:33,861
Some kind of interstellar
cops and robbers.

827
00:59:34,294 --> 00:59:36,630
Now he's going after
that missing ship.

828
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:38,567
And whatever's on board.

829
00:59:39,201 --> 00:59:41,500
I want that fucking ship.

830
00:59:41,502 --> 00:59:42,637
We're in the ballpark.

831
00:59:43,036 --> 00:59:44,573
Captain McKenna's son?

832
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:45,973
Mother confirms.

833
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,806
He has the operating system.

834
00:59:47,808 --> 00:59:49,975
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Thought it was a video game.

835
00:59:49,977 --> 00:59:51,478
So, we find the kid,
we find the ship.

836
00:59:51,480 --> 00:59:53,615
What the fuck we
still standing here for?

837
00:59:53,948 --> 00:59:55,380
You don't want to know
what that one is?

838
00:59:55,382 --> 00:59:57,250
I know what it is.
Our big boy's a hunter.

839
00:59:57,252 --> 00:59:58,687
He brought his dogs with him.

840
01:00:03,491 --> 01:00:04,790
No, it had to be like

841
01:00:04,792 --> 01:00:06,560
a government experiment
or some shit.

842
01:00:07,228 --> 01:00:08,495
Like a robot, or whatever.

843
01:00:08,497 --> 01:00:10,228
Nettles, are you
fucking retarded, man?

844
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,065
Use another word, would ya?

845
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:14,100
Yeah, man.
Show a little sensitivity.

846
01:00:14,102 --> 01:00:15,569
His son's retarded.

847
01:00:16,004 --> 01:00:17,504
Here you go.

848
01:00:17,506 --> 01:00:18,573
Here you go.

849
01:00:18,973 --> 01:00:20,542
He does this from time to time.

850
01:00:21,176 --> 01:00:22,411
Just give him a minute.

851
01:00:22,877 --> 01:00:24,446
Hey, Lynch.

852
01:00:25,379 --> 01:00:27,145
What's the deal
with these two?

853
01:00:27,147 --> 01:00:28,982
Coyle lit up
one of his own vehicles?

854
01:00:28,984 --> 01:00:31,686
Back in '09, yeah.
It was bad business. Six dead.

855
01:00:31,953 --> 01:00:33,152
What, no survivors?

856
01:00:33,154 --> 01:00:35,056
Yeah, there was one.

857
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:41,096
It's fucking romantic.

858
01:00:41,529 --> 01:00:43,629
Are you kidding me,
they're friends?

859
01:00:43,631 --> 01:00:44,631
Picture it.

860
01:00:44,665 --> 01:00:46,466
Military inquiries,
sitting outside courtroom,

861
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:48,268
waiting to go in,
side by side,

862
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,338
- day after fucking day.
- After fucking day.

863
01:00:50,672 --> 01:00:51,703
Unbelievable.

864
01:00:51,705 --> 01:00:53,107
It's the loonies.

865
01:01:02,149 --> 01:01:03,417
All right, kid.

866
01:01:04,051 --> 01:01:05,419
I've talked to your mother.

867
01:01:05,953 --> 01:01:07,255
She's doing fine.

868
01:01:07,922 --> 01:01:09,457
Mom says you're a killer.

869
01:01:10,725 --> 01:01:13,326
Well, I'm a soldier.

870
01:01:13,694 --> 01:01:15,130
What's the difference?

871
01:01:18,500 --> 01:01:19,768
Well, when you like it,

872
01:01:20,201 --> 01:01:21,636
that's when you're a killer.

873
01:01:24,205 --> 01:01:25,741
Are you good?

874
01:01:28,243 --> 01:01:29,678
Sorry I never grew up.

875
01:01:31,046 --> 01:01:33,515
You know...
the way you wanted.

876
01:01:39,687 --> 01:01:40,721
Tell you a secret.

877
01:01:43,091 --> 01:01:44,359
Truth is, kid,

878
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:47,362
I never grew up
the way I wanted.

879
01:01:50,397 --> 01:01:53,433
Are we gonna get killed?

880
01:01:57,471 --> 01:01:58,473
Nope.

881
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:01,543
Come on.
Get up.

882
01:02:01,743 --> 01:02:04,045
I'm single.
I don't know if you knew that.

883
01:02:04,344 --> 01:02:06,314
No, I could tell
that you're single.

884
01:02:06,982 --> 01:02:09,315
We got so much stuff
in common, you know...

885
01:02:09,783 --> 01:02:12,618
You like music, I like music.
You like music, right?

886
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:14,489
- Shit.
- What?

887
01:02:15,422 --> 01:02:17,022
This is more than spinal fluid.

888
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:18,192
What does that mean?

889
01:02:18,493 --> 01:02:19,527
If I'm right,

890
01:02:20,627 --> 01:02:22,862
they're trying
to upgrade themselves.

891
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,365
McKenna, I got something.

892
01:02:24,899 --> 01:02:26,232
I think I know
what they're up to

893
01:02:26,234 --> 01:02:27,435
on Predator World these days.

894
01:02:27,634 --> 01:02:30,837
You see this? They found this
in the Predator's plexus.

895
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,205
So, remember how I told you

896
01:02:32,207 --> 01:02:33,741
how they take
people's spines, right?

897
01:02:34,276 --> 01:02:35,641
Yeah, for trophies.

898
01:02:35,643 --> 01:02:38,243
Yes! Yes!
From the strongest, smartest,

899
01:02:38,245 --> 01:02:41,246
most dangerous species
on every planet they visit.

900
01:02:41,248 --> 01:02:42,448
Collecting survival traits

901
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:43,951
from the most
high-end specimens.

902
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:46,520
I think they're
attempting hybridization.

903
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:49,487
You're just pulling this
out of your ass.

904
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:51,625
Did you not see
the new Predator?

905
01:02:53,462 --> 01:02:54,596
It's evolving.

906
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,330
Or being upgraded.

907
01:03:03,837 --> 01:03:05,069
That little boy

908
01:03:05,071 --> 01:03:07,374
managed to figure out
alien technology.

909
01:03:08,408 --> 01:03:10,308
You know,
a lot of experts say that

910
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,413
being on the spectrum
isn't really a disorder.

911
01:03:12,980 --> 01:03:15,515
It's actually the next step
in the evolutionary chain.

912
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:17,283
Hey, yo!
What the fuck?

913
01:03:17,285 --> 01:03:18,683
Get the fuck away from me!

914
01:03:18,685 --> 01:03:20,855
Yo! Casey!

915
01:03:21,790 --> 01:03:23,291
Casey, get inside.

916
01:03:23,924 --> 01:03:24,926
Casey!

917
01:03:25,192 --> 01:03:27,694
Hey, hey, hey! Calm down!
Calm down! Calm down!

918
01:03:27,696 --> 01:03:28,826
Casey! Look.

919
01:03:28,828 --> 01:03:31,230
I think this thing's
been following us, all right?

920
01:03:31,232 --> 01:03:34,000
- Move, Netty!
- Hey, hey, hey!

921
01:03:34,002 --> 01:03:35,768
- Space dog!
- Move, Netty!

922
01:03:39,841 --> 01:03:40,940
Fuck that.

923
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,375
Hey! You had
your fucking chance.

924
01:03:43,712 --> 01:03:46,444
Look, I'm just saying,
what the fuck is it gonna do?

925
01:03:46,446 --> 01:03:48,380
You know, maybe we can
use it, or something?

926
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:50,415
Okay, what are we doing?
What are we doing with it?

927
01:03:50,417 --> 01:03:52,652
We're gonna study it. That's
what we're gonna do with it.

928
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:54,252
What's to learn?
Except Williams sucks

929
01:03:54,254 --> 01:03:55,654
at shooting shit in the head.

930
01:03:55,656 --> 01:03:57,556
Williams, you lobotomized him.

931
01:03:57,558 --> 01:04:00,092
Okay, new rule.
No one shoots my fucking dog.

932
01:04:01,161 --> 01:04:02,328
There it is.
It's official.

933
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:04,165
You were right,
we can use this.

934
01:04:08,136 --> 01:04:09,137
Shit.

935
01:04:09,569 --> 01:04:11,172
Netty, what is that?

936
01:04:13,408 --> 01:04:14,648
Everybody, tighten up.

937
01:04:14,709 --> 01:04:16,375
- Little man, come here.
- That's an EC-130.

938
01:04:16,377 --> 01:04:17,710
That's not civilian.

939
01:04:17,712 --> 01:04:18,712
Hey, hey, hey!

940
01:04:18,812 --> 01:04:21,145
You are not starting
a firefight with my kid here.

941
01:04:21,147 --> 01:04:22,182
There you go.

942
01:04:22,517 --> 01:04:25,183
Do you wanna help? Go get
a helicopter and some pyro.

943
01:04:25,185 --> 01:04:27,020
All right! On me!

944
01:04:27,221 --> 01:04:28,386
Now go!

945
01:04:28,388 --> 01:04:30,855
- Casey! I'll be right back!
- No, you won't.

946
01:04:30,857 --> 01:04:32,525
Hold on. Hey. See this?

947
01:04:32,527 --> 01:04:34,863
Come on. Let's go!
Let's go! Come on!

948
01:04:35,062 --> 01:04:36,765
Fetch!

949
01:05:00,221 --> 01:05:01,456
Where is it?

950
01:05:01,656 --> 01:05:02,657
Where's what?

951
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:04,925
The device.

952
01:05:05,259 --> 01:05:07,728
It goes, right in here.

953
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:15,402
Okay, so, the first Predator,
Thing One.

954
01:05:15,636 --> 01:05:17,772
Why'd he come here? To Earth?

955
01:05:18,038 --> 01:05:20,105
The "Thing One",
as you called him,

956
01:05:20,107 --> 01:05:22,509
arrived in
a hijacked spacecraft.

957
01:05:22,944 --> 01:05:24,411
We think there's
something on it.

958
01:05:24,745 --> 01:05:26,614
Something he didn't want
his enemies to have.

959
01:05:27,181 --> 01:05:28,283
Wait, enemies?

960
01:05:28,582 --> 01:05:30,815
Other Predators.
Like that big one.

961
01:05:30,817 --> 01:05:33,618
So, he brought some what?
Gift for the human race?

962
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,254
I'll help you find it.
We can analyze it...

963
01:05:35,256 --> 01:05:36,690
Shut the fuck up!

964
01:05:40,361 --> 01:05:41,796
Why are they here?

965
01:05:43,797 --> 01:05:46,633
You remember a few years back
when Hostess went bust?

966
01:05:47,167 --> 01:05:49,069
There was a run on Twinkies?

967
01:05:49,303 --> 01:05:51,237
Snapped up
from coast-to-coast.

968
01:05:51,239 --> 01:05:52,941
Get 'em while they still last.

969
01:05:53,808 --> 01:05:54,809
Remember?

970
01:05:55,810 --> 01:05:59,314
How long before climate change
renders this planet unlivable?

971
01:06:00,649 --> 01:06:01,815
Two generations?

972
01:06:02,850 --> 01:06:03,848
One?

973
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,951
That's why their visits
are increasing?

974
01:06:05,953 --> 01:06:06,919
They're trying to snap up

975
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:08,489
all of our best DNA
before we're gone.

976
01:06:08,756 --> 01:06:12,125
Adapt themselves with it
and then move in.

977
01:06:12,627 --> 01:06:15,426
We're an endangered species,
and they know it.

978
01:06:15,428 --> 01:06:17,131
They thrive
in a hothouse environment.

979
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:19,500
Maybe they want
to move into ours.

980
01:06:20,234 --> 01:06:21,466
And that dead Predator

981
01:06:21,468 --> 01:06:23,437
was bringing us
a way to stop them.

982
01:06:25,806 --> 01:06:28,306
You've hidden this thing
before in the mail.

983
01:06:29,542 --> 01:06:31,176
So, where is it this time?

984
01:06:31,178 --> 01:06:32,713
Your mother's ass.

985
01:06:33,080 --> 01:06:34,783
Wait, did I say that out loud?

986
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:41,520
Hey! Hey! Hey! No, no, no.
That is not for you.

987
01:06:41,522 --> 01:06:42,522
That is my son's,

988
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:44,223
and you are violating
his privacy reading that.

989
01:06:44,225 --> 01:06:45,505
You both need
to leave right now.

990
01:06:45,558 --> 01:06:47,460
Ma'am, I don't wanna
restrain you.

991
01:06:47,727 --> 01:06:49,863
Really? Well,
why don't you try?

992
01:07:41,982 --> 01:07:43,716
<i>You haven't
found the spacecraft?</i>

993
01:07:43,718 --> 01:07:45,551
<i>Why are we trying
to crack the entry code?</i>

994
01:07:45,553 --> 01:07:47,618
Because when we do
find it, wouldn't it be great

995
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:48,987
if we could
get into the fucking thing?

996
01:07:48,989 --> 01:07:50,125
What's that?

997
01:07:50,957 --> 01:07:52,059
A map.

998
01:07:52,493 --> 01:07:53,493
A map to what?

999
01:07:53,893 --> 01:07:55,839
<i>...give us
a clue of where this place is,</i>

1000
01:07:55,863 --> 01:07:57,596
<i>maybe we can try
to get into it.</i>

1001
01:07:57,598 --> 01:07:59,734
<i>But if you don't give us
anything, we can't get in!</i>

1002
01:08:12,980 --> 01:08:15,183
Hey, Rory, I'm Will.

1003
01:08:15,849 --> 01:08:16,849
How you doing?

1004
01:08:17,117 --> 01:08:19,453
I understand you know
where the spaceship is.

1005
01:08:33,268 --> 01:08:34,469
Golf tomorrow?

1006
01:08:34,769 --> 01:08:35,837
Why not?

1007
01:08:36,403 --> 01:08:38,605
You two never read
my file, did ya?

1008
01:08:39,105 --> 01:08:40,105
What makes you say that?

1009
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:42,777
'Cause you two morons
are making plans for tomorrow.

1010
01:08:44,278 --> 01:08:45,379
The worst part is,

1011
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,849
you're making me lie to my son.

1012
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:50,919
What lie did you
tell him, hmm?

1013
01:08:52,219 --> 01:08:53,755
That I won't enjoy this.

1014
01:09:02,462 --> 01:09:04,031
Hey, please, don't.

1015
01:09:04,864 --> 01:09:06,798
Look, I don't know
what they told you...

1016
01:09:06,800 --> 01:09:09,302
Can you just wait
for a second? Just wait!

1017
01:09:09,304 --> 01:09:10,839
No, no, no!

1018
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,272
No.

1019
01:09:17,478 --> 01:09:19,344
Jeez!

1020
01:09:19,346 --> 01:09:20,614
Oh, my God.

1021
01:09:57,885 --> 01:09:58,885
Nebraska!

1022
01:09:58,919 --> 01:10:00,785
- Yeah?
- You just kill somebody?

1023
01:10:00,787 --> 01:10:02,120
Well, he ain't well.

1024
01:10:02,122 --> 01:10:03,355
Untie my friend.

1025
01:10:03,357 --> 01:10:04,858
They got Rory. We gotta move.

1026
01:10:05,325 --> 01:10:06,559
Shit, they rough you up?

1027
01:10:06,859 --> 01:10:08,893
Did worse on myself,
back in the day.

1028
01:10:10,130 --> 01:10:11,965
What do you want to do
with this guy?

1029
01:10:14,702 --> 01:10:16,468
Sorry, buddy,
that was a dumb question.

1030
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:17,805
Yeah, that was
a dumb question.

1031
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,020
Casey!

1032
01:10:34,888 --> 01:10:37,091
Can I interest you in getting
the fuck out of here?

1033
01:10:37,724 --> 01:10:39,727
"Getting the fuck out of here"
is my middle name.

1034
01:10:40,394 --> 01:10:42,093
And I thought Gaylord was bad.

1035
01:10:44,799 --> 01:10:46,768
What? What's wrong?

1036
01:10:50,104 --> 01:10:51,773
Whew! All right.

1037
01:10:51,973 --> 01:10:54,071
Hey! Just let me unpack this.

1038
01:10:54,073 --> 01:10:55,841
You're saying my son's headed
towards a spaceship

1039
01:10:55,843 --> 01:10:57,308
and so is a 10-foot alien.

1040
01:10:57,310 --> 01:10:58,610
Uh, 11, actually.

1041
01:10:58,612 --> 01:10:59,880
Used to be a contractor.

1042
01:11:00,113 --> 01:11:01,813
This thing is a hybrid?
What does that mean?

1043
01:11:01,815 --> 01:11:03,915
Meaning it's the Chinese menu
of DNA.

1044
01:11:03,917 --> 01:11:05,950
Comprised of the deadliest
species in the entire...

1045
01:11:05,952 --> 01:11:07,386
In the entire universe, yeah?

1046
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:08,786
- Galaxy.
- What?

1047
01:11:08,788 --> 01:11:10,856
Galaxy. 250 billion stars.

1048
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:12,726
Why go universe? Just saying.

1049
01:11:26,607 --> 01:11:28,606
Jesus Tap-Dancing Christ!

1050
01:11:28,608 --> 01:11:29,674
That's what you asked for?

1051
01:11:29,676 --> 01:11:30,877
Yeah, that'll do.

1052
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,748
Saddle up!

1053
01:11:37,151 --> 01:11:38,853
It's the best
we could do, man.

1054
01:11:41,788 --> 01:11:42,853
Go ahead. Go!

1055
01:11:42,855 --> 01:11:44,356
That's it? Another one.

1056
01:11:44,358 --> 01:11:45,490
The other one!

1057
01:11:45,492 --> 01:11:47,060
Come on.
Let's go get my kid.

1058
01:11:50,264 --> 01:11:52,834
Figured something out.
I think we're gonna die.

1059
01:11:53,701 --> 01:11:55,734
We're gonna go hunt and fight
the what, the army?

1060
01:11:55,736 --> 01:11:57,002
We're not gonna
fight the army...

1061
01:11:57,004 --> 01:11:58,771
And some
fucking people from space!

1062
01:11:58,773 --> 01:12:00,341
You wanna talk survival, huh?

1063
01:12:00,974 --> 01:12:01,874
Fine!

1064
01:12:01,876 --> 01:12:04,209
You, yesterday,
you were on a prison bus

1065
01:12:04,211 --> 01:12:05,410
barking to yourself,

1066
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:07,279
now you got a gun
in your hand.

1067
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,649
Who's a survivor now?

1068
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:11,717
We put bullets in our head

1069
01:12:11,719 --> 01:12:13,287
and walk
to the fucking hospital.

1070
01:12:13,755 --> 01:12:15,023
We're soldiers!

1071
01:12:16,523 --> 01:12:17,991
Nettles, what's our 20?

1072
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:20,025
I can follow
your boy's chopper.

1073
01:12:20,027 --> 01:12:21,429
I locked into its frequency.

1074
01:12:35,742 --> 01:12:37,044
Fence is hot!

1075
01:12:56,930 --> 01:12:58,299
What do you say, buddy?

1076
01:12:59,065 --> 01:13:00,535
You think you can get us
in there?

1077
01:13:01,234 --> 01:13:03,403
Because I'm not sure
that you can.

1078
01:13:03,836 --> 01:13:05,272
Nice reverse psychology.

1079
01:13:05,773 --> 01:13:07,207
I can do that, too.

1080
01:13:07,407 --> 01:13:08,776
Don't go fuck yourself.

1081
01:13:11,912 --> 01:13:13,480
That's good. Come on.

1082
01:13:13,880 --> 01:13:16,248
Good. Almost up and running.
Five minutes.

1083
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:17,115
Right on.

1084
01:13:17,117 --> 01:13:18,618
It's a translator unit, Rory.

1085
01:13:18,885 --> 01:13:20,052
Been trying to figure out

1086
01:13:20,054 --> 01:13:21,518
what these
bird-chirping motherfuckers

1087
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,855
been saying since '87.

1088
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:24,655
Gave the Harvard School
of Linguistics

1089
01:13:24,657 --> 01:13:25,957
a billion-dollar grant.

1090
01:13:25,959 --> 01:13:28,328
Voila. Watch your step,
come on.

1091
01:13:40,474 --> 01:13:43,176
Goddamn, kid, I don't know
where you get it from.

1092
01:14:10,403 --> 01:14:12,570
Put the translator
into the mainframe.

1093
01:14:12,572 --> 01:14:13,907
Download everything.

1094
01:14:20,647 --> 01:14:22,047
What the hell's
inside there?

1095
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,781
It's property
of Project Stargazer.

1096
01:14:23,783 --> 01:14:26,019
That's what the fuck it is.

1097
01:14:27,854 --> 01:14:29,353
<i>Code three. Code three.</i>

1098
01:14:29,355 --> 01:14:30,875
<i>We have motion
at the south fence line.</i>

1099
01:14:31,224 --> 01:14:32,692
Send a fireteam
to check it out.

1100
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,263
That's my dad.
He's gonna come save me now.

1101
01:14:35,696 --> 01:14:36,930
Oh, is he?

1102
01:14:37,965 --> 01:14:39,466
Is that what he's gonna do?

1103
01:14:40,065 --> 01:14:41,501
I'll tell you what, buddy...

1104
01:14:42,636 --> 01:14:43,836
if it is your daddy,

1105
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:46,206
and I truly hope that it is...

1106
01:14:46,739 --> 01:14:48,440
he's gotta be just about

1107
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:51,979
the dumbest motherfucker
I've ever met.

1108
01:14:53,947 --> 01:14:57,382
I mean, a Ranger sniper
tripping wire sensors?

1109
01:14:57,384 --> 01:14:58,586
He's gotta be...

1110
01:15:00,321 --> 01:15:01,619
creating a diversion.

1111
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:03,123
It's a fucking diversion.

1112
01:15:04,558 --> 01:15:05,824
Oh, shit!

1113
01:15:05,826 --> 01:15:07,094
Wow. Howdy.

1114
01:15:07,327 --> 01:15:09,407
What, are you gonna kill us
with a fucking tranq gun?

1115
01:15:09,862 --> 01:15:11,565
You took my boy, so yeah.

1116
01:15:12,332 --> 01:15:13,334
Told you.

1117
01:15:14,268 --> 01:15:15,268
Take this, son.

1118
01:15:15,502 --> 01:15:18,136
You outta your mind? We
literally have you surrounded.

1119
01:15:18,138 --> 01:15:19,503
That's why
you're coming with me.

1120
01:15:19,505 --> 01:15:21,373
I just want the boy.
Nobody's got to die.

1121
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,375
Dad?

1122
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:26,143
From here forward.

1123
01:15:26,145 --> 01:15:27,915
Don't look at the dead guy.

1124
01:15:48,402 --> 01:15:49,668
That was pretty good.

1125
01:15:49,670 --> 01:15:50,835
You all right? Did I get you?

1126
01:15:50,837 --> 01:15:52,038
No, I'm good.

1127
01:15:52,773 --> 01:15:53,937
Welcome back.

1128
01:15:53,939 --> 01:15:55,242
Fuck you. I never left.

1129
01:15:58,045 --> 01:15:59,244
You open your mouth,

1130
01:15:59,246 --> 01:16:01,079
I'm gonna blow your brains
right through it.

1131
01:16:01,081 --> 01:16:02,215
Come on, just get behind me.

1132
01:16:02,616 --> 01:16:04,548
<i>All units. They got Traeger.</i>

1133
01:16:04,550 --> 01:16:05,585
<i>They got Traeger.</i>

1134
01:16:07,019 --> 01:16:08,354
Let's go. Let's go.

1135
01:16:08,889 --> 01:16:10,625
Just tell them
to put the guns down.

1136
01:16:20,434 --> 01:16:21,469
Tell them!

1137
01:16:23,237 --> 01:16:24,802
If Captain McKenna
doesn't lower his weapon

1138
01:16:24,804 --> 01:16:25,804
in the next 10 seconds...

1139
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:27,838
shoot the kid's knees out.
That work for you?

1140
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:29,108
Oh, that's a really bad idea.

1141
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,642
My guys got this place covered
on every angle.

1142
01:16:31,644 --> 01:16:33,611
That's a funny story.
See, I don't give a shit.

1143
01:16:33,613 --> 01:16:34,613
10.

1144
01:16:35,815 --> 01:16:37,050
Nine.

1145
01:16:37,617 --> 01:16:38,618
Eight.

1146
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:40,921
Seven.

1147
01:16:41,455 --> 01:16:43,621
Come on, you just give
the fucking word, man.

1148
01:16:43,623 --> 01:16:44,688
Six. Five.

1149
01:16:59,907 --> 01:17:01,442
Oh, shit!

1150
01:17:03,077 --> 01:17:04,345
Come on, son!

1151
01:17:06,846 --> 01:17:08,081
Take them down!

1152
01:17:13,987 --> 01:17:15,119
Get down, sir.

1153
01:17:15,121 --> 01:17:16,754
Let's go, son. Go!

1154
01:17:16,756 --> 01:17:18,091
Come on. Come on.

1155
01:17:23,863 --> 01:17:25,565
Okay, take this.

1156
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:27,966
You wanna vanish,

1157
01:17:27,968 --> 01:17:29,603
you really vanish, son,
you understand?

1158
01:17:29,903 --> 01:17:32,339
All right, we're going home.
I promise you.

1159
01:17:42,049 --> 01:17:43,250
It's here.

1160
01:17:49,822 --> 01:17:51,424
No! No! No!

1161
01:17:57,363 --> 01:17:59,083
Come on,
go around the end there!

1162
01:17:59,264 --> 01:18:00,599
Stay on him!
Stay on him!

1163
01:18:00,901 --> 01:18:02,167
Move, move, move!

1164
01:18:02,169 --> 01:18:03,671
- You got him?
- Yeah!

1165
01:18:15,114 --> 01:18:16,815
Stay back.

1166
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,152
Get down! Get down!

1167
01:18:20,386 --> 01:18:24,491
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1168
01:18:51,117 --> 01:18:52,718
- Huh?
- All right.

1169
01:18:52,986 --> 01:18:54,086
Hey, McKenna.

1170
01:18:54,287 --> 01:18:57,223
Be reasonable. There's six
of you, seven of us.

1171
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:00,258
Fuck!

1172
01:19:00,260 --> 01:19:01,829
Who taught you math?

1173
01:19:02,062 --> 01:19:04,265
You ain't the only
fucking sniper, white boy.

1174
01:19:06,032 --> 01:19:08,334
You can walk away
from this, Captain.

1175
01:19:08,902 --> 01:19:10,334
I just want the ship.

1176
01:19:10,336 --> 01:19:12,736
- Dad, he's lying.
- Yeah.

1177
01:19:12,738 --> 01:19:14,974
McKenna! I don't like this.

1178
01:19:15,341 --> 01:19:16,743
What's he doing in there?

1179
01:19:28,656 --> 01:19:30,357
It's using the translator.

1180
01:19:32,358 --> 01:19:34,327
<i>Hello. I have enjoyed</i>

1181
01:19:34,528 --> 01:19:36,096
<i>watching you kill each other.</i>

1182
01:19:36,496 --> 01:19:38,931
<i>I came here
to destroy this vessel.</i>

1183
01:19:39,232 --> 01:19:41,031
<i>You cannot have it.</i>

1184
01:19:41,033 --> 01:19:43,169
<i>What you can do is run.</i>

1185
01:19:43,702 --> 01:19:46,839
<i>I detect one among you
who is a true warrior.</i>

1186
01:19:47,206 --> 01:19:49,309
<i>The one called McKenna.</i>

1187
01:19:51,144 --> 01:19:52,580
<i>He will be your leader.</i>

1188
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:54,580
<i>He will be my prize.</i>

1189
01:19:54,915 --> 01:19:56,783
<i>I offer time advantage.</i>

1190
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:58,752
<i>Go.</i>

1191
01:19:59,118 --> 01:20:00,752
What the fuck
is time advantage?

1192
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:01,822
Like a head start?

1193
01:20:05,325 --> 01:20:06,894
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1194
01:20:07,861 --> 01:20:09,296
I'm gonna wake up on a bus.

1195
01:20:12,065 --> 01:20:13,265
Hey!

1196
01:20:13,599 --> 01:20:14,634
I'm coming out!

1197
01:20:24,178 --> 01:20:25,379
We're in.

1198
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,579
- Baxley!
- Shit!

1199
01:20:27,581 --> 01:20:29,421
Watch where the fuck you're
throwing, dickhead.

1200
01:20:29,616 --> 01:20:31,318
Will do.

1201
01:20:32,118 --> 01:20:34,319
Okay, so we split up.
12 different directions.

1202
01:20:34,321 --> 01:20:36,221
- McKenna's the one he wants.
- No, no, no!

1203
01:20:36,223 --> 01:20:38,490
We stay together,
or it'll take us one by one.

1204
01:20:38,492 --> 01:20:39,924
He's right. It's their MO.

1205
01:20:39,926 --> 01:20:41,927
- Grow a dick, will you?
- Nothing's starting!

1206
01:20:41,929 --> 01:20:44,197
Son of a bitch. He must have
hacked the vehicles.

1207
01:20:44,397 --> 01:20:46,798
If we can get to the helicopter,
go two klicks north.

1208
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:47,800
- Got you.
- Hey?

1209
01:20:47,867 --> 01:20:49,935
When this is over, you and me,
we're gonna dance.

1210
01:20:49,937 --> 01:20:51,102
I got my shoes all picked out.

1211
01:20:51,104 --> 01:20:52,306
All right.

1212
01:21:00,179 --> 01:21:02,248
- Fuck.
- No, no, no! Don't.

1213
01:21:02,983 --> 01:21:04,885
Here, boy. Fetch.

1214
01:21:06,053 --> 01:21:07,652
Here, boy.

1215
01:21:07,654 --> 01:21:08,656
Here you go.

1216
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:13,194
That was a valuable weapon.

1217
01:21:15,062 --> 01:21:16,830
Let's go.
He'll be coming for us.

1218
01:21:55,434 --> 01:21:56,903
Give me the goody bag.

1219
01:21:58,438 --> 01:22:01,105
Hey. On Halloween,
this blew up a whole house.

1220
01:22:01,107 --> 01:22:02,707
- How do you shoot it?
- You don't.

1221
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,976
It just fires by itself
when it's being attacked.

1222
01:22:04,978 --> 01:22:06,547
Seriously? Oh, shit.

1223
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:16,254
I heard something.

1224
01:22:16,256 --> 01:22:18,558
Hey, man.
That's Predator technology.

1225
01:22:19,725 --> 01:22:20,892
Fuck.

1226
01:22:20,894 --> 01:22:22,393
That... It's gonna come back.

1227
01:22:22,395 --> 01:22:24,398
You got, uh, a catcher
on the wrist.

1228
01:22:24,965 --> 01:22:26,267
That's gonna come back.

1229
01:22:27,667 --> 01:22:28,669
No!

1230
01:22:29,501 --> 01:22:31,604
Quiet. Quiet.

1231
01:22:32,404 --> 01:22:34,204
- Let me see. Let me see.
- My fucking hand.

1232
01:22:34,206 --> 01:22:35,709
- Shit.
- My fucking hand.

1233
01:22:38,011 --> 01:22:39,279
Gotta be quiet.

1234
01:22:57,964 --> 01:22:59,065
Moving!

1235
01:23:14,980 --> 01:23:17,451
No, no, no!
This way. This way. This way.

1236
01:23:18,550 --> 01:23:19,819
There's a clearing up ahead.

1237
01:23:20,187 --> 01:23:22,520
Lynch left some pyro up there.
To cover our retreat.

1238
01:23:22,522 --> 01:23:24,321
Let's find it
and trap the motherfucker.

1239
01:23:24,323 --> 01:23:26,826
You guys go set it up.
We'll lure him in.

1240
01:23:27,126 --> 01:23:28,826
- Who?
- You and me.

1241
01:23:28,828 --> 01:23:29,828
Yeah? All right.

1242
01:23:30,095 --> 01:23:31,698
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1243
01:23:32,732 --> 01:23:33,734
Come on.

1244
01:23:35,469 --> 01:23:37,133
Can I talk to you
for a second?

1245
01:23:37,135 --> 01:23:38,369
What's this "we" shit?

1246
01:23:38,371 --> 01:23:39,670
What, are you gonna
live forever, Coyle?

1247
01:23:39,672 --> 01:23:41,338
- Just calm down.
- Calm down?

1248
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:44,275
Me, calm down?
Yeah, okay, thanks, twitchy.

1249
01:23:44,277 --> 01:23:46,480
Move, move, move!
Up here. Up, up, up.

1250
01:24:08,468 --> 01:24:10,504
Shit!

1251
01:24:13,139 --> 01:24:14,407
Okay, fuck this.

1252
01:24:15,475 --> 01:24:17,009
Hey! Asshole!

1253
01:24:17,410 --> 01:24:18,443
What the fuck was that?

1254
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:20,414
It's a chance for you
to survive.

1255
01:24:21,114 --> 01:24:22,181
Go! I got this.

1256
01:24:22,482 --> 01:24:24,518
That's the stupidest fucking
thing I've ever heard.

1257
01:24:30,690 --> 01:24:32,593
Come and get us, asshole!

1258
01:24:34,794 --> 01:24:35,893
Contact!

1259
01:24:35,895 --> 01:24:37,163
- Alien!
- Contact!

1260
01:24:39,265 --> 01:24:40,765
- Contact!
- Alien!

1261
01:24:40,767 --> 01:24:41,969
- Contact!
- He's coming!

1262
01:24:47,407 --> 01:24:49,309
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1263
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:48,902
Light him up!

1264
01:26:04,184 --> 01:26:05,786
Coyle!

1265
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:07,721
Bax, no!

1266
01:26:12,692 --> 01:26:14,928
Traeger!

1267
01:26:22,434 --> 01:26:23,869
Baxley!

1268
01:26:23,871 --> 01:26:24,872
Die!

1269
01:26:43,889 --> 01:26:45,725
Oh, shit.

1270
01:26:45,992 --> 01:26:47,060
Fuck.

1271
01:27:09,515 --> 01:27:10,817
Move, move!

1272
01:27:16,389 --> 01:27:17,924
- Nettles!
- Let's go!

1273
01:27:24,263 --> 01:27:25,899
McKenna.

1274
01:27:28,835 --> 01:27:29,937
Rory.

1275
01:27:30,536 --> 01:27:31,537
I love you.

1276
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:34,204
Hey! I'm the one you want.

1277
01:27:34,206 --> 01:27:36,642
Right here! Come on! You...

1278
01:27:37,544 --> 01:27:39,110
Dad!

1279
01:27:39,112 --> 01:27:40,113
No!

1280
01:27:44,184 --> 01:27:45,185
Dad!

1281
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:57,229
- No! No! No!
- McKenna

1282
01:27:58,331 --> 01:27:59,663
No! No!

1283
01:27:59,665 --> 01:28:02,031
I hate you,
you stupid fucking...

1284
01:28:02,033 --> 01:28:03,804
No! No!

1285
01:28:04,336 --> 01:28:05,571
He said he wanted me.

1286
01:28:05,837 --> 01:28:07,538
He said he wanted me!

1287
01:28:07,540 --> 01:28:09,874
No. He said he wanted McKenna.

1288
01:28:09,876 --> 01:28:12,479
The next step
in the evolutionary chain.

1289
01:28:12,813 --> 01:28:15,047
Not you. Your son.

1290
01:28:32,031 --> 01:28:33,300
Yo, he's taking off.

1291
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:41,708
No!

1292
01:28:43,876 --> 01:28:45,642
Come on, man. Come on.

1293
01:28:45,644 --> 01:28:46,979
Come on.

1294
01:28:57,523 --> 01:28:58,825
Let's take it down!

1295
01:28:59,125 --> 01:29:00,193
Come on!

1296
01:29:18,278 --> 01:29:19,446
Hang on!

1297
01:29:22,814 --> 01:29:25,685
Fuck! Nebraska!

1298
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:43,870
I got you!

1299
01:29:51,178 --> 01:29:54,480
Dad, there's a force field
coming online. Look out!

1300
01:29:58,451 --> 01:30:00,787
Guys! Something's coming!

1301
01:30:03,156 --> 01:30:04,224
Go!

1302
01:30:11,663 --> 01:30:12,866
Netty!

1303
01:30:17,237 --> 01:30:19,172
Fuck!

1304
01:30:19,639 --> 01:30:20,741
Netty!

1305
01:30:30,349 --> 01:30:31,516
Hey, hey, hey.

1306
01:30:31,518 --> 01:30:33,086
No, no, no! Bro!

1307
01:30:34,086 --> 01:30:35,087
Bro.

1308
01:30:43,129 --> 01:30:44,430
No.

1309
01:30:54,006 --> 01:30:55,075
Fuck!

1310
01:32:51,690 --> 01:32:52,893
Shit!

1311
01:32:59,866 --> 01:33:01,067
Rory!

1312
01:33:58,190 --> 01:33:59,392
Toss it!

1313
01:34:53,380 --> 01:34:54,578
What are you?

1314
01:34:56,648 --> 01:34:57,648
Shut the fuck up.

1315
01:35:18,336 --> 01:35:19,538
My unit.

1316
01:35:21,873 --> 01:35:23,175
Nettles.

1317
01:35:25,411 --> 01:35:26,578
Coyle.

1318
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:30,816
I see you saw Lynch's card.

1319
01:35:33,251 --> 01:35:35,421
Baxley had this
the whole time.

1320
01:35:38,757 --> 01:35:40,225
Nebraska's bad habit.

1321
01:35:41,727 --> 01:35:42,796
Son...

1322
01:35:43,095 --> 01:35:45,431
these are the ones
that no one's gonna remember.

1323
01:35:46,599 --> 01:35:47,800
Just us.

1324
01:35:48,434 --> 01:35:50,370
What do you say
we put them to rest?

1325
01:36:34,147 --> 01:36:35,547
Captain McKenna.

1326
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:39,517
Hiroshi Yamada.

1327
01:36:39,519 --> 01:36:41,387
- Sir.
- First things first.

1328
01:36:41,586 --> 01:36:43,920
I want to say thank you
for having such a great kid.

1329
01:36:43,922 --> 01:36:44,989
He loves it here.

1330
01:36:45,224 --> 01:36:47,091
Yeah, he's something else.
What do we got, Doctor?

1331
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:49,161
Well, I assume
that you know by now,

1332
01:36:49,461 --> 01:36:52,130
but the first Predator,
it didn't come here to hunt us.

1333
01:36:52,364 --> 01:36:54,298
- He brought something.
- Exactly.

1334
01:36:54,300 --> 01:36:55,835
Now, you want
to hear the good news?

1335
01:36:57,069 --> 01:36:58,470
The cargo survived.

1336
01:36:59,237 --> 01:37:00,771
With some sort of fail-safe.

1337
01:37:00,773 --> 01:37:03,007
Before the upgrade Predator
blew up the ship,

1338
01:37:03,242 --> 01:37:04,475
a pod escaped.

1339
01:37:04,477 --> 01:37:06,246
Jettisoned.
Saved itself.

1340
01:37:07,313 --> 01:37:10,783
It seems that our boy
wasn't taking any chances.

1341
01:37:11,216 --> 01:37:13,350
He wanted us to have this.

1342
01:37:27,065 --> 01:37:29,068
What is it again
you do here, exactly?

1343
01:37:29,635 --> 01:37:32,605
He's the world's number one
authority on cybernetics.

1344
01:37:34,706 --> 01:37:36,175
Hey, kiddo.

1345
01:37:38,243 --> 01:37:39,409
Pretty cool, huh?

1346
01:37:39,411 --> 01:37:40,944
Pretty cool.
You got your own desk.

1347
01:37:40,946 --> 01:37:42,448
I'll make sure to tell Mom.

1348
01:37:43,515 --> 01:37:47,386
So, this is his gift
to humankind?

1349
01:38:03,236 --> 01:38:05,235
- Get back!
- Look out!

1350
01:38:05,237 --> 01:38:06,669
Everyone, stand back!

1351
01:38:06,671 --> 01:38:07,991
Stand back!
Clear the area!

1352
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,382
Dad, the pod
sent me a message.

1353
01:38:18,550 --> 01:38:20,886
- Rory, what's in that pod?
- Don't know!

1354
01:38:22,321 --> 01:38:23,788
Oh, wow... Oh, shit!

1355
01:38:23,790 --> 01:38:25,757
- It's got a name!
- Name? What name?

1356
01:38:26,090 --> 01:38:28,025
I guess you'd call it,

1357
01:38:28,027 --> 01:38:29,362
the Predator Killer.

1358
01:38:29,694 --> 01:38:31,854
- Get him out of here!
- Come with me. Let's go.

1359
01:38:33,299 --> 01:38:35,132
Get back.
Clear the area.

1360
01:38:35,134 --> 01:38:36,368
Eyes on it.

1361
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,403
Whatever it is,
it appears to be dormant.

1362
01:39:10,870 --> 01:39:13,369
I assume it needs to be...

1363
01:39:13,371 --> 01:39:15,941
Eyes on.
Keep your weapons trained.

1364
01:39:16,274 --> 01:39:18,777
Get it off!
Get it off me!

1365
01:39:51,844 --> 01:39:53,145
What the hell is that?

1366
01:39:53,511 --> 01:39:55,380
That's my new suit, bubba.

1367
01:39:57,517 --> 01:39:59,551
I hope they got it
in a 42 long.
