1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:06,878
Baba...

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,256
<i>Yes, my son.</i>

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:09,903
<i>Tell me a story.</i>

4
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:12,089
<i>Which one?</i>

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:14,341
<i>The story of home.</i>

6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,091
<i>Millions of years ago...</i>

7
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,851
<i>a meteorite made of vibranium...</i>

8
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,354
<i>the strongest substance
in the universe...</i>

9
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,436
<i>struck the continent of Africa...</i>

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:30,479
<i>affecting the plant life around it.</i>

11
00:00:30,656 --> 00:00:32,648
<i>And when the time of man came...</i>

12
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:36,659
<i>five tribes settled on it
and called it Wakanda.</i>

13
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:41,956
<i>The tribes lived in constant
war with each other...</i>

14
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:44,287
<i>until a warrior shaman...</i>

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:47,420
<i>received a vision from
the Panther Goddess Bast...</i>

16
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,627
<i>who led him
to the Heart-Shaped Herb...</i>

17
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,112
<i>a plant that granted him</i>

18
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:57,130
<i>superhuman strength,
speed and instincts.</i>

19
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,718
<i>The warrior became king...</i>

20
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,259
<i>and the first Black Panther...</i>

21
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:04,019
<i>the protector of Wakanda.</i>

22
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,023
<i>Four tribes agreed to live
under the king's rule...</i>

23
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:11,527
<i>but the Jabari Tribe isolated
themselves in the mountains.</i>

24
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,315
<i>The Wakandans used vibranium
to develop technology...</i>

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,735
<i>more advanced
than any other nation.</i>

26
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,574
<i>But as Wakanda thrived...</i>

27
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:24,161
<i>the world around it descended
further into chaos.</i>

28
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,545
<i>To keep vibranium safe...</i>

29
00:01:29,715 --> 00:01:32,674
<i>the Wakandans vowed
to hide in plain sight...</i>

30
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,572
<i>keeping the truth of their power</i>

31
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:37,588
<i>from the outside world.</i>

32
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,965
<i>And we still hide,</i> Baba?

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,016
<i>Yes.</i>

34
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,893
<i>Why?</i>

36
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:57,107
Lucky shot!
That ain't lucky!

37
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,616
Whatever!
Get outta here!

38
00:01:58,744 --> 00:01:59,804
Check up.

39
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:01,990
Pick your man up! He open.

40
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,201
Where you at?

41
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:06,161
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

42
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:07,496
Pass! Pass!

43
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,785
Got you, E.
E, hurry up!

44
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,453
Watch me get this.

45
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,484
Tim Hardaway style.
That's what I call it, baby.

46
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,569
Come on.

47
00:02:14,593 --> 00:02:15,653
What you got?

48
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:16,667
You ain't got nothing.

49
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,781
Hey, look, if we get in and out quick,

50
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,795
won't be no worries.

51
00:02:19,973 --> 00:02:21,930
You in the van,
come in through from the west.

52
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,328
Come around the corner.

53
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:24,513
Land right here.
Mmm-hmm.

54
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,302
Me and the twins
are pulling up right here.

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,708
We're leaving this car behind,
okay? We come this...

56
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:34,018
Hide the straps.

57
00:02:42,371 --> 00:02:44,363
Yo, is it the Feds?

58
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,366
No.

59
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,298
It's these two
Grace Jones-looking chicks.

60
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,008
They're holding spears.

61
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:06,592
Open it.

62
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,470
You serious?

63
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,181
They won't knock again.

64
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:30,033
Who are you?

65
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,247
Prince N'Jobu, son of Azzuri.

66
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,464
Prove to me you are one of us.

67
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,264
My King.

68
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:49,268
Leave us.

69
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:52,431
This is James. I trust him
with my life. He stays...

70
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,724
with your permission,
King T'Chaka.

71
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:57,314
As you wish.

72
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,603
At ease.

73
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,165
Come, baby brother.

74
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:13,041
Let me see
how you are holding up.

75
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,214
You look strong.

76
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,366
Glory to Bast,
I am in good health.

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,380
How is home?

78
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,684
Not so good.

79
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,644
Baby brother.

80
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,180
There has been an attack.

81
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,815
This man...

82
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,897
Ulysses Klaue...

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,317
stole a quarter ton of
vibranium from us...

84
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,733
and triggered a bomb
at the border to escape.

85
00:04:47,037 --> 00:04:48,528
Many lives were lost.

86
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,907
He knew where we hid
the vibranium...

87
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,619
and how to strike.

88
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:56,710
He had someone on the inside.

89
00:04:57,589 --> 00:04:58,875
Why are you here?

90
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:02,341
Because I want you
to look me in the eyes...

91
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,424
and tell me
why you betrayed Wakanda.

92
00:05:05,597 --> 00:05:08,214
I did no such thing.

93
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:12,177
Tell him who you are.

94
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,687
Zuri, son of Badu...

95
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:15,846
What?

96
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,133
James. James, you lied to me?

97
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,218
Leave him.

98
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:26,302
You were Wakandan this whole time?

99
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,386
You betrayed Wakanda!

100
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,471
How could you lie to me like...

101
00:05:28,495 --> 00:05:30,452
Stand down.

102
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:37,327
Did you think that you were
the only spy we sent here?

103
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,557
Prince N'Jobu...

104
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,342
you will return home at once...

105
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,386
where you will face
the Council...

106
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:58,227
and inform them of your crimes.

107
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:02,755
Check up!

108
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,404
Guard your man, guard your man!

109
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,691
Yo.

110
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,730
<i>The tiny nation of Wakanda</i>

111
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:03,622
<i>is mourning the death
of its monarch, King T'Chaka.</i>

112
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,290
<i>The beloved ruler was one of
many confirmed dead...</i>

113
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:07,612
<i>after a terrorist attack</i>

114
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,298
<i>at the United Nations
a week ago.</i>

115
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:12,700
<i>The suspect
has since been apprehended.</i>

116
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:13,826
<i>Though it remains one of</i>

117
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:14,966
<i>the poorest countries
in the world...</i>

118
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,884
<i>fortified by mountain ranges...</i>

119
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,678
<i>and an impenetrable
rainforest...</i>

120
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,000
<i>Wakanda does not engage</i>

121
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:23,687
<i>in international trade
or accept aid.</i>

122
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,101
<i>The succession of the throne...</i>

123
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,547
<i>is expected to fall
to the oldest</i>

124
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,857
<i>of the king's two children...</i>

125
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,363
<i>Prince T'Challa.</i>

126
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,233
My Prince...

127
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,322
coming up on them now.

128
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,761
No need, Okoye.
I can handle this alone.

129
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,012
Hmm.

130
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:08,937
I will get Nakia out
as quickly as possible.

131
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,196
Just don't freeze
when you see her.

132
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:16,906
What are you talking about?

133
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,697
I never freeze.

134
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,826
What's going on?

135
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:40,389
It's the car.
It lost power. It won't start.

136
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,678
The car no start.

137
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:44,166
What happened?

138
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,522
The engine failed.

139
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:48,184
Ours, too.

140
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,482
What is it, Captain?

141
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,479
Defense positions.

142
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,869
Defense positions.

143
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,379
Are we under attack?

144
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,959
Defense positions.

145
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,258
Get around to the side.

146
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,302
Defense positions.

147
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:19,632
Hey. Defense positions!

148
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,681
No games.

149
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:46,204
What do you see?

150
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,822
Come in. Come in.

151
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,257
Over there! Look back!

152
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,089
Watch out!

153
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,325
T'Challa, no!

154
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:29,744
This one's just a boy.

155
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,317
He got kidnapped as well.

156
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:34,331
Nakia...

157
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:39,924
I...

158
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,640
I wanted...
Hey!

159
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,473
I have her!
Don't move! I will shoot!

160
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,391
I will shoot her right now.

161
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,150
You froze.

162
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,148
Ah...

163
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,992
Why are you here?
You've ruined my mission.

164
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:08,370
My father is dead, Nakia.

165
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,540
I will be crowned king tomorrow.

166
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,585
And I wish for you to be there.

167
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,451
Carry yourselves home now.

168
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,536
Thank you.

169
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,051
And take the boy.
Get him to his people.

170
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,514
Thank you oh.

171
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,396
You will speak
nothing of this day.

172
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,897
Yes.

173
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,773
Thank you.

174
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,817
Thank you.

175
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,566
Sister Nakia...

176
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:22,531
My Prince...

177
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,942
we are home.

178
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:02,855
This never gets old.

179
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,036
Queen Mother...

180
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,958
Princess...

181
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,048
My comfort for your loss.

182
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,253
Thank you, Nakia.

183
00:14:04,427 --> 00:14:07,044
It is so good
to have you back with us.

184
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,366
Take her to the River Province

185
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:10,597
to prepare her for the ceremony.

186
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:11,928
Yes, General.

187
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:22,226
Did he freeze?

188
00:14:22,737 --> 00:14:24,757
Like an antelope in headlights.

189
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,322
Are you finished?

190
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,350
So surprised
my little sister came

191
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:36,286
to see me off
before our big day.

192
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,519
You wish!

193
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,286
I'm here for the EMP beads.
I've developed an update.

194
00:14:40,463 --> 00:14:42,625
Update? No.
It worked perfectly.

195
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:44,256
How many times
do I have to teach you?

196
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,694
Just because something works

197
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,425
doesn't mean
that it cannot be improved.

198
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,757
You are teaching me?
What do you know?

199
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,055
More than you.

200
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,722
I can't wait to see what kind
of update you make...

201
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,807
to your ceremonial outfit.

202
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,396
Shuri!

203
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,183
Sorry, Mother!

204
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:05,026
How are you feeling today, Mama?

205
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:06,566
Proud.

206
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,325
Your father and I would talk
about this day all the time.

207
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,862
He is with us...

208
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:18,077
and it is your time to be king.

209
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,893
Good morning.

210
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,561
How can I help you?

211
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,668
I was just checking out
these artifacts.

212
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:43,919
They tell me you're the expert.

213
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,230
Ah. You could say that.

214
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,066
They're beautiful.

215
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,691
Where's this one from?

216
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:54,326
The Bobo Ashanti tribe...

217
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:55,736
present day Ghana...

218
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:56,994
19th century.

219
00:15:57,165 --> 00:15:58,155
For real?

220
00:15:59,417 --> 00:16:01,158
What about this one?

221
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,961
That one's from the Edo people of Benin...

222
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,997
16th century.

223
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:13,091
Now, tell me about this one.

224
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:17,119
Also from Benin,
seventh century.

225
00:16:17,143 --> 00:16:19,226
Fula tribe, I believe.

226
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:21,770
Nah.

227
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:23,597
I beg your pardon?

228
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,711
It was taken by
British soldiers in Benin

229
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:26,896
but it's from Wakanda.

230
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,560
And it's made out of vibranium.

231
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,426
Don't trip.

232
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,907
I'mma take it
off your hands for you.

233
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:37,285
These items aren't for sale.

234
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,034
How do you think
your ancestors got these?

235
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,699
You think they paid
a fair price?

236
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:44,038
Or did they take it, like they
took everything else?

237
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,190
Sir, I'm going to have to

238
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,671
ask you to leave.

239
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,359
You got
all this security in here

240
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,874
watching me
ever since I walked in.

241
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,488
But you ain't checking for

242
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:54,615
what you put in your body.

243
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,949
All right, mate.
Let's have it.

244
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,509
Come on, mate. Time.

245
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,140
I think she might not
be feeling too good.

246
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,684
Somebody get some help!
Come here!

247
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,562
Call a doctor, please!
Please, somebody, come help!

248
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:05,834
Medical emergency right away

249
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,224
in the West African Exhibit,
please, right away.

250
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:08,462
Look out.

251
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:11,103
Step back, please.
Step back. Thank you.

252
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,988
Coming through over there.
Medics coming through.

253
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:16,491
I'm gonna take a break.

254
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,868
Let's give the
lady some space, please.

255
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,143
Step back, please, gents.

256
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:24,453
Step back, please.

257
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,213
Hey, come here.

258
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:33,251
Come here. It's okay.

259
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:37,137
You can go, but just don't
tell anyone, all right?

260
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,873
Bro, why you ain't just
shoot him right here?

261
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:45,958
Because it's better to leave

262
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,018
the crime scene more spread out.

263
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,899
Makes us look like amateurs.

264
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,938
Now then, let's see if you know

265
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:09,544
what you're talking about.

266
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:18,428
That's just a taste.

267
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,147
You're gonna be a rich boy.
You better sell that quick.

268
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:38,941
It's already sold!

269
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:40,804
Whatever you try,

270
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,930
the Wakandans'll
probably show up.

271
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,473
That'll make my day.

272
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,783
I can kill two birds
with one stone.

273
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:49,250
You're not telling me
that's vibranium, too?

274
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,207
Nah, I'm just feeling it.

275
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:33,874
Onward!

276
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,331
Onward!

277
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,871
I, Zuri...

278
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:57,170
son of Badu...

279
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,081
give to you...

280
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,420
Prince T'Challa...

281
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,363
the Black Panther!

282
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,803
The prince...

283
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:14,597
will now have the strength
of the Black Panther...

284
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:17,016
stripped away.

285
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:50,845
Praise the ancestors.

286
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,308
Praise the ancestors.

287
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,480
Victory in ritual combat...

288
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,188
comes by yield or death.

289
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,900
If any tribe wishes to
put forth a warrior...

290
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,905
I now offer...

291
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,596
a path to the throne.

292
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:18,021
The Merchant Tribe
will not challenge today.

293
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:24,110
The Border Tribe
will not challenge today.

294
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:29,825
The River Tribe
will not challenge today.

295
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,725
The Mining Tribe
will not challenge today.

296
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,808
Is there any member
of a royal blood...

297
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,892
who wishes to challenge
for the throne?

298
00:22:45,656 --> 00:22:48,490
This corset
is really uncomfortable...

299
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,902
so could we all just
wrap it up and go home?

300
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,574
Mother!

301
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:20,476
Are they Jabari?
Yes.

302
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:32,193
M'Baku, what are you doing here?

303
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,321
It's challenge day.

304
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:43,161
We have watched...

305
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,293
and listened from the mountains!

306
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:48,424
We have watched with disgust...

307
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,448
as your
technological advancements

308
00:23:51,472 --> 00:23:53,555
have been overseen by a child!

309
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:59,599
Who scoffs at tradition!

310
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,335
And now you want to
hand the nation

311
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,271
over to this prince...

312
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:11,407
who could not keep
his own father safe.

313
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,988
Mmm?

314
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:18,079
We will not have it.

315
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:22,333
I said, we will not have it, oh!

316
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,995
I, M'Baku...

317
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,252
leader of the Jabari...

318
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:32,715
I accept your challenge, M'Baku.

319
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,926
Glory to Hanuman.

320
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,201
Jabari!

321
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:57,902
Dora Milaje!

322
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,325
Onward!

323
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,248
Let the challenge begin!

324
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,847
Oh!

325
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:25,638
Stand up!

326
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,615
Come!

327
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:46,209
T'Challa!

328
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,882
Where is your god now?

329
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,810
Yes!

330
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,441
No powers.

331
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,239
No claws.

332
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,195
No special suit, oh!

333
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,407
Just a boy not fit to lead!

334
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,643
Show him who you are!

335
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,849
I am Prince T'Challa...

336
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,601
son of King T'Chaka!

337
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:47,457
You can do this, T'Challa!

338
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,193
Yes!

339
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:03,736
Come on!

340
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:06,076
Yield! Don't make me kill you.

341
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:07,832
I would rather die!

342
00:27:11,255 --> 00:27:12,245
T'Challa!

343
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,455
T'Challa!

344
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:16,207
T'Challa!

345
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,209
T'Challa!

346
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,115
T'Challa!

347
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:21,255
You have fought with honor!

348
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,014
Now yield!
Your people need you.

349
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,174
T'Challa!

350
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:26,663
T'Challa!

351
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,848
Yield, man!

352
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,262
T'Challa!

353
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:30,680
T'Challa!

354
00:27:32,526 --> 00:27:35,018
Yes! Yes!

355
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,175
I now present to you...

356
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,677
King T'Challa...

357
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:06,258
the Black Panther.

358
00:28:12,274 --> 00:28:13,390
Zuri.

359
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:15,525
My King.

360
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:27,821
Wakanda forever!

361
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:30,081
Wakanda forever!

362
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,028
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

363
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,365
to restore the powers
of the Black Panther...

364
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:11,406
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

365
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:15,998
T'Chaka...

366
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:19,164
we call on you.

367
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,209
Come here to your son.

368
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,184
Praise the ancestors.

369
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:07,063
Father.

370
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,735
My son.

371
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,583
I'm sorry.

372
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,540
Stand up.

373
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,921
You are a king.

374
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,847
What is wrong my son?

375
00:31:41,274 --> 00:31:43,607
I am not ready.

376
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,777
Have you not prepared

377
00:31:46,947 --> 00:31:51,157
to be king your whole life?

378
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,865
Have you not trained
and studied,

379
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:57,868
been by my side?

380
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,285
That is not
what I am talking about.

381
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:09,422
I am not ready
to be without you.

382
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,658
A man who has not prepared
his children

383
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,218
for his own death...

384
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:17,554
has failed as a father.

385
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,265
Have I ever failed you?

386
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,313
Never.

387
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,563
Tell me how to
best protect Wakanda.

388
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,281
I want to be a great king, <i>Baba.</i>

389
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,241
Just like you.

390
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,827
You're going to struggle.

391
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,895
So you'll need to
surround yourself

392
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,626
with people you trust.

393
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:48,039
You're a good man
with a good heart.

394
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:51,547
And it's hard
for a good man to be king.

395
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,343
Breathe.

396
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:00,054
T'Challa, breathe.

397
00:33:01,897 --> 00:33:03,229
Breathe.

398
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,773
He was there.

399
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:10,528
He was there. My father.

400
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,369
Just one?

401
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,053
Come home, Nakia.

402
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,464
I'm right here.

403
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,098
Stay.

404
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:43,261
I came to support you
and to honor your father...

405
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,804
but I can't stay.

406
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,808
I found my calling out there.

407
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,437
I've seen too many in need
just to turn a blind eye.

408
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,446
I can't be happy here...

409
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,324
knowing that there's people
out there who have nothing.

410
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,370
What would you have
Wakanda do about it?

411
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,664
Share what we have.

412
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,324
We could provide aid...

413
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,562
and access to technology

414
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:07,793
and refuge to those who need it.

415
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,413
Other countries do it,
we could do it better.

416
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,005
We are not like
these other countries, Nakia.

417
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,087
If the world found out
what we truly are...

418
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:19,756
what we possess...

419
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:21,595
we could lose our way of life.

420
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:24,121
Wakanda is strong enough
to help others

421
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,977
and protect ourselves
at the same time.

422
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,687
If you were not so stubborn,
you would make a great queen.

423
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,318
I would make a great queen
because I am so stubborn.

424
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:36,981
Ah! See, you admit it!
If that's what I wanted.

425
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,743
Is that him?

426
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:50,999
Glory to Bast, man.
Is he still growing?

427
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:53,497
Of course.

428
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,334
I see Nakia is back.

429
00:34:57,846 --> 00:34:59,007
You guys going to work it out?

430
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,469
T'Challa...

431
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,724
what's wrong?

432
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,480
Nakia thinks
we should be doing more.

433
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,640
More, like what?

434
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,060
Foreign aid, refugee programs.

435
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,069
You let the refugees in...

436
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,697
they bring their problems
with them.

437
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:21,154
And then Wakanda
is like everywhere else.

438
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,864
Now if you said
you wanted me and my men...

439
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,603
to go out there
and clean up the world,

440
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:30,243
then I'll be all for it.

441
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,690
But waging war
on other countries

442
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,296
has never been our way.

443
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,044
You, too, huh?

444
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,883
Bast! We're in trouble.

445
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,009
<i>My King.</i>

446
00:35:46,936 --> 00:35:47,926
<i>My love.</i>

447
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,563
<i>You will never guess who just
popped up on our radar.</i>

448
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:57,149
A misidentified
Wakandan artifact...

449
00:35:57,322 --> 00:35:59,985
was stolen yesterday
from a British museum.

450
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:04,277
We have learned Ulysses Klaue...

451
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:07,288
plans to sell the vibranium
to an American buyer...

452
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:08,789
in South Korea...

453
00:36:08,958 --> 00:36:10,369
tomorrow night.

454
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:15,956
Klaue has escaped our pursuits
for almost 30 years.

455
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:20,384
Not capturing him is, perhaps,
my father's greatest regret.

456
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,637
I wish to bring Klaue
back here to stand trial.

457
00:36:23,807 --> 00:36:28,427
Wakanda does not need
a warrior right now.

458
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:29,843
We need a king.

459
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,684
My parents were killed
when he attacked.

460
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,628
Not a day goes by
when I do not think

461
00:36:35,652 --> 00:36:37,735
about what Klaue took from us.

462
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:40,354
From me.

463
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:43,445
It's too great
an opportunity to pass.

464
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:44,804
Take me with you.

465
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,820
We'll take him down together,
side by side.

466
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:50,034
I need you here
protecting the border.

467
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,449
Then I ask...

468
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,743
you kill him where he stands...

469
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,003
or you bring him back to us.

470
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,292
You have my word.

471
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:02,168
I will bring him back.

472
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,675
We will proceed
with the mission.

473
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,718
My King!

474
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:54,637
Stop it. Stop it.

475
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,813
I've already sent a car ahead
to Busan for you.

476
00:38:00,445 --> 00:38:02,311
Who are you taking with you
to Korea?

477
00:38:02,739 --> 00:38:03,820
Okoye.

478
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:06,398
And Nakia as well.

479
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:12,030
You sure it's a good idea
to take your ex on a mission?

480
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:13,580
Yes.

481
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:15,853
We'll be fine.

482
00:38:15,877 --> 00:38:17,789
Besides, you'll be on call
should we need backup.

483
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,123
Yes!

484
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,664
I have great things
to show you, Brother.

485
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:24,208
Here are your communication
devices for Korea.

486
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:26,781
Unlimited range,

487
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,548
also equipped with
audio surveillance system.

488
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,056
Check these out.

489
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:35,386
Remote access Kimoyo Beads.

490
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:38,351
Updated to interface directly
with my sand table.

491
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:40,058
Ah.

492
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,191
And what are these?

493
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,341
The real question is
what are those?

494
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,906
Why do you have
your toes out in my lab?

495
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,068
What, you don't like
my royal sandals?

496
00:38:50,245 --> 00:38:53,033
I wanted to go old school
for my first day.

497
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,184
I bet the Elders loved that.

498
00:38:56,376 --> 00:38:57,366
Try them on.

499
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,500
Fully automated.

500
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:05,236
Like the old American movie
<i>Baba</i> used to watch.

501
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,320
Mmm.

502
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,506
And I made them
completely sound absorbent.

503
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,672
Interesting.

504
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:13,591
Guess what I call them.

505
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,134
Sneakers.

506
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,096
Because you...

507
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,434
Never mind.

508
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:22,316
If you're going to take
on Klaue...

509
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,650
you'll need the best
the design group has to offer.

510
00:39:26,823 --> 00:39:27,939
Exhibit A.

511
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,652
My design.
Old tech.

512
00:39:29,826 --> 00:39:32,068
Old?
Functional, but old.

513
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,973
"Hey, people are shooting at me.

514
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,954
"Wait, let me put on
my helmet."

515
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:37,706
Enough.

516
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,750
Now, look at these.

517
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,713
Do you like that one?

518
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:46,169
Tempting.

519
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,384
But the idea
is to not be noticed.

520
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,212
This one.

521
00:39:59,272 --> 00:40:00,934
Now tell it to go on.

522
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,486
Ooh!

523
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,695
The entire suit sits within
the teeth of the necklace.

524
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,988
Strike it.

525
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,161
Anywhere?
Mmm-hmm.

526
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:21,287
Not that hard, genius!

527
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,669
You told me to strike it.
You didn't say how hard.

528
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:25,190
I invite you to my lab,

529
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,671
and you just kick things around?

530
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,612
Well, maybe you should make it
a little stronger.

531
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,738
Hey.

532
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,298
Wait a minute.

533
00:40:32,472 --> 00:40:35,180
The nanites absorb
the kinetic energy...

534
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,763
and hold it in place
for redistribution.

535
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,268
Very nice.

536
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,100
Strike it again
in the same spot.

537
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:46,267
You're recording?

538
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,602
For research purposes.

539
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,244
Delete that footage.

540
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:18,845
This way.

541
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,470
Bast willing,
this will go quickly...

542
00:41:23,648 --> 00:41:26,641
and I can get this ridiculous
thing off my head.

543
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:30,027
It looks nice.
Just whip it back and forth.

544
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,859
What? It's a disgrace.

545
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,488
Hello Sophia.

546
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,994
Good to see you.

547
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,871
Who are these two?

548
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,144
My friends from Kenya.

549
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:46,626
Very deep pockets.
They're good.

550
00:41:47,046 --> 00:41:49,504
Good for trouble...

551
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,256
like you?

552
00:42:00,101 --> 00:42:01,558
Thank you!

553
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,661
Spread out.

554
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:28,202
The buyer
is likely already here.

555
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,805
The woman outside.

556
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,003
What trouble
was she referring to?

557
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:53,881
Ah... I got into
a disagreement

558
00:42:53,905 --> 00:42:55,737
with some ivory traders.

559
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,010
Made a bit of a mess.
Hmm.

560
00:42:58,034 --> 00:43:00,262
And will there be
any trouble tonight,

561
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,198
Ms. Kenyan Heiress?

562
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:03,532
Depends...

563
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,914
on how quickly we finish
the mission.

564
00:43:06,084 --> 00:43:07,916
<i>Can we please focus?</i>

565
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:10,956
Thank you.

566
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,580
Over here.

567
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,132
One whiskey, please.

568
00:43:26,771 --> 00:43:29,559
Eyes up. Americans.

569
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,355
I count three.

570
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,730
Five.

571
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,301
How could you miss
Greased Lightning

572
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,566
there behind you?

573
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,859
Six.

574
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:45,450
Just spotted an old friend
who works for the CIA.

575
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:48,206
It just got
a little more complicated.

576
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:52,620
Agent Ross.

577
00:43:52,797 --> 00:43:53,913
Your Highness.

578
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,005
You are buying from Klaue.

579
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,710
What I'm doing or not doing...

580
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,365
on behalf of
the U.S. government

581
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,596
is none of your concern.

582
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,427
Now, whatever the hell
you're up to...

583
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,683
do me a favor,
stay out of my way.

584
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,139
I gave you Zemo.

585
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,678
Didn't I keep it under wraps...

586
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,542
that the king of
a third world country

587
00:44:11,566 --> 00:44:13,523
runs around
in a bulletproof cat suit?

588
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:15,059
I'd say we were even.

589
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,818
You really need to leave, now.

590
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:20,780
Klaue is leaving
out that door with me.

591
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,484
You've been warned.

592
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:26,449
Three, craps.

593
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,322
Hey, you won!

594
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,162
You know what?

595
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,327
I think I'll just take these...

596
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:35,274
bring them over here

597
00:44:35,298 --> 00:44:37,631
and hold on for safekeeping.
Mmm-hmm.

598
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:43,345
Okay, heads up.
The king of Wakanda is here.

599
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,221
He cannot leave with Klaue.

600
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,757
All right.

601
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,371
Vibranium from the attack on Sokovia

602
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:50,385
links back to a person...

603
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:51,748
that I'm not actually saying

604
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:52,762
I'm here to make a deal with...

605
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,307
but that deal
will not be called off.

606
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,795
When the dust settles,

607
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:58,355
you and me can work
something out.

608
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,395
I'm not here to make a deal.

609
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:29,303
Klaue, plus eight!

610
00:45:29,644 --> 00:45:30,634
General.

611
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,677
In position to secure our exit.

612
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:33,845
And the vibranium?

613
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,643
I don't see it yet.

614
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,399
<i>I thought there were
no weapons allowed in here.</i>

615
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,310
There's not supposed to be.

616
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,855
Somebody did not get the memo.

617
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:45,365
Definitely armed.

618
00:45:46,202 --> 00:45:48,068
Well, that is quite
the entourage.

619
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,407
You got a mixtape coming out?

620
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,197
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, actually, there is one.

621
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,241
I'll send you the SoundCloud
link, if you like.

622
00:45:54,418 --> 00:45:55,704
Hey, Dave, can you get
the link to the tape?

623
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:57,460
Please, don't make me
listen to your music.

624
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,371
I just meant you got a lot of
people with you.

625
00:46:00,216 --> 00:46:01,957
You think they're for you?

626
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:04,255
Don't worry.

627
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,365
I can do a deal with you
all by myself,

628
00:46:06,389 --> 00:46:07,550
thank you very much.

629
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:17,473
<i>Six more. It's a setup.</i>

630
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,728
You got the diamonds?

631
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:22,185
Okay. That's enough.

632
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,690
We need to move on Klaue.
<i>Stand down.</i>

633
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,780
We can't afford a shootout.

634
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:29,943
Vibranium?

635
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,372
I was going to buy
a fancy suitcase...

636
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:44,041
but I thought
I'd save myself some money.

637
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,126
It's now or never.

638
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,420
Stand down!

639
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:48,720
Hey!

640
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:04,027
Wakandans!
They're here!

641
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,072
Get outta here!
Kill 'em all!

642
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,318
Diamonds, quick!

643
00:48:08,094 --> 00:48:09,154
Murderer!

644
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:18,038
You know, you look just like
your old man.

645
00:48:27,488 --> 00:48:29,925
I made it rain!

646
00:48:29,949 --> 00:48:31,656
Let's get out of here, boss!

647
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,364
That was awesome!
That was awesome!

648
00:48:38,541 --> 00:48:41,079
Let's go! Go, go, go, come on!

649
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:45,420
Do we just leave him?
He'll catch up.

650
00:48:53,681 --> 00:48:54,797
Shuri!

651
00:48:58,394 --> 00:48:59,384
Yes!

652
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:01,975
<i>Remote driving system activated.</i>

653
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,584
Wait! Which side of
the road is it?

654
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:05,724
<i>For Bast's sake!</i>

655
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,233
<i>Just drive!</i>
Okay, calm down!

656
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,201
Whoo! Let's go!

657
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,579
Put some music on. What do you
think this is, a funeral?

658
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:24,667
Which one is he in now?

659
00:49:26,964 --> 00:49:28,296
Hey, split up!

660
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,628
They're trying to lose us.
I'll take the right.

661
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:36,463
We'll take the other two!
I see a shortcut.

662
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,772
We're not going to make it!

663
00:49:55,451 --> 00:49:56,532
Keep going!

664
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:04,616
Whoo! Brother!

665
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,593
Hey, what was that?

666
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,755
Don't worry about it.
You're doing great.

667
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,309
Guns.

668
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,853
So primitive!

669
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,925
It's a vibranium car,
you idiots!

670
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,110
The bullets won't penetrate!

671
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:39,363
What are you doing?

672
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:40,744
Just drive.

673
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:58,799
Whoo!
Shit!

674
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,814
Hey, look at your suit.

675
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:15,173
You've been taking bullets,

676
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:17,063
charging it up
with kinetic energy.

677
00:51:18,951 --> 00:51:20,158
Pull around the truck.

678
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,206
Where'd he go?

679
00:51:35,593 --> 00:51:36,925
You show-off.

680
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,168
There he is!

681
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:42,589
Hold tight!

682
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,556
All right.
Let's have some fun!

683
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:16,914
Hop in.

684
00:52:17,426 --> 00:52:19,793
Put that spear in the trunk.

685
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,133
Faster, Shuri.

686
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,926
I'm going as fast as I can!

687
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:30,812
Take a right! Take a right!

688
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,608
No, no, no!

689
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,067
Brother!

690
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,591
Klaue!

691
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:08,349
Did you think we would forget?

692
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,360
Look at me, murderer!

693
00:53:20,406 --> 00:53:21,772
Where did you get this weapon?

694
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:24,678
You savages didn't deserve it.

695
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:30,746
Oh, mercy, King. Mercy.

696
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,033
Every breath you take
is mercy from me.

697
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,451
King!

698
00:53:35,087 --> 00:53:36,953
The world watches.

699
00:53:37,131 --> 00:53:39,109
Come on. Guys.
Let's go, huh?

700
00:53:44,805 --> 00:53:45,795
Yeah.

701
00:54:00,529 --> 00:54:01,770
Hello.

702
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,512
I can see you! I can.
I can see you.

703
00:54:15,669 --> 00:54:17,376
So this is a big mess, huh?

704
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:19,754
I figured we could go
good cop, bad cop.

705
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,209
I'll talk to him first,
then you guys go in.

706
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:25,176
We can't let him
talk to Klaue alone.

707
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,286
Better to let him talk to
Klaue alone for 5 minutes

708
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:34,223
than to make a scene here.

709
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,791
After your questioning,

710
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:38,727
we will take him back
to Wakanda with us.

711
00:54:38,901 --> 00:54:41,439
What? No.
Look, I like you, a lot.

712
00:54:41,612 --> 00:54:44,400
But he's in my custody now.
He's not going anywhere.

713
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:46,301
Listen, I'm doing you guys
a favor

714
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:47,907
by letting you even be in here.

715
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,737
If he touches you again,

716
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,664
I'm going to impale him
to this desk.

717
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,917
Does she speak English?

718
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,002
When she wants to.

719
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:01,941
Huh.

720
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:03,067
I'm going in.

721
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,253
When I'm done, you guys are up.

722
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:07,168
Agent Ross.
Yeah?

723
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,634
I do appreciate your help
in Busan.

724
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:12,390
You see that?

725
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:14,137
It's called diplomacy.

726
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,331
You're welcome.

727
00:55:16,355 --> 00:55:17,415
(KLAUE SINGS <i>WHAT IS LOVE</i>

728
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:20,668
Okoye.

729
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:21,773
Play nice.

730
00:55:21,944 --> 00:55:23,025
Americans.

731
00:55:35,082 --> 00:55:36,994
You know, you really shouldn't
trust the Wakandans.

732
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:38,453
I'm much more your speed.

733
00:55:38,627 --> 00:55:40,459
I don't trust anybody,
not in this job.

734
00:55:40,629 --> 00:55:43,121
But what I am interested in
is that arm cannon out there.

735
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:44,459
Where'd you get that?

736
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:46,340
It's an old mining tool that
I made some adjustments to.

737
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:48,877
But I can get you one,
if you like.

738
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,949
Why don't you give me the name
of your supplier,

739
00:55:50,973 --> 00:55:52,009
and I'll ask them.

740
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:53,639
He's right outside.

741
00:55:53,809 --> 00:55:55,391
Why don't you ask him yourself?

742
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:57,052
What? T'Challa?

743
00:55:57,229 --> 00:56:00,563
You're telling me that weapon
on your arm is from Wakanda?

744
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:01,722
Bingo.

745
00:56:03,026 --> 00:56:06,064
What do you actually know
about Wakanda?

746
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:07,479
Um...

747
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:10,740
Shepherds, textiles,
cool outfits.

748
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,195
<i>It's all a front.</i>

749
00:56:12,828 --> 00:56:15,411
<i>Explorers searched for it
for centuries.</i>

750
00:56:15,581 --> 00:56:18,039
<i>El Dorado, the Golden City.</i>

751
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:20,541
<i>They thought they could
find it in South America...</i>

752
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:23,579
but it was in Africa
the whole time.

753
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,542
A technological marvel.

754
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,194
All because it was built
on a mound

755
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:30,255
of the most valuable metal
known to man.

756
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,513
<i>Isipho,</i> they call it.
The gift.

757
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,215
Vibranium.

758
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,554
Vibranium, yeah,
strongest metal on earth.

759
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:38,935
It's not just a metal.

760
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,642
They sew it into their clothes.

761
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,603
It powers their city,
their tech...

762
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,017
their weapons.

763
00:56:46,695 --> 00:56:47,776
Weapons?

764
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,007
Yeah.

765
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,444
Makes my arm cannon
look like a leaf blower.

766
00:56:51,617 --> 00:56:52,969
That's a nice fairy tale,

767
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,905
but Wakanda is
a third world country...

768
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:57,536
and you stole
all their vibranium.

769
00:56:57,706 --> 00:56:58,992
I stole...

770
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,618
All of it?

771
00:57:04,922 --> 00:57:07,505
I took a tiny piece of it.

772
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,381
They have a mountain full of it.

773
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,759
<i>They've been mining it
for thousands of years...</i>

774
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:14,171
<i>and they still haven't
scratched the surface.</i>

775
00:57:14,348 --> 00:57:16,367
<i>I'm the only outsider
who's seen it</i>

776
00:57:16,391 --> 00:57:17,973
<i>and got out of there alive.</i>

777
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,871
<i>If you don't believe me,</i>

778
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:23,138
<i>you ask your friend
what his suit is made of.</i>

779
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:26,065
What his claws are made of.

780
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:50,756
Your father told the UN...

781
00:57:50,926 --> 00:57:53,839
that Klaue stole
all the vibranium you had.

782
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,548
But now he's telling me
you have more.

783
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,200
And you believe the word

784
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:59,786
of an arms dealer
strapped to a chair?

785
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:19,611
Where is that?

786
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,371
Back there.

787
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,509
How much more are you hiding?

788
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,838
Something is happening out back.

789
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,099
Get down!

790
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,021
Stand down!

791
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:56,564
Cover!

792
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,690
Grenade!

793
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:03,571
I see you took your time,
didn't you?

794
00:59:23,393 --> 00:59:24,554
My King!

795
00:59:27,856 --> 00:59:29,017
My King.

796
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,307
Nakia.

797
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,922
He just jumped in front of me.

798
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,427
I don't think
he'll make it here.

799
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,817
It hit his spine.

800
00:59:43,455 --> 00:59:45,162
Give me a Kimoyo Bead.

801
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,481
This will stabilize him for now.

802
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,962
Give him to us.

803
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:03,381
We can save him.

804
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:14,809
Our mission was to bring back Klaue.

805
01:00:15,946 --> 01:00:17,278
We failed.

806
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,656
This man is a foreign
intelligence operative.

807
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,364
How do we justify
bringing him into our borders?

808
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:24,778
He took a bullet for me.

809
01:00:24,955 --> 01:00:26,662
That was his choice.

810
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,366
So now we are just supposed to
let him die?

811
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,375
Let us consider
that we heal him.

812
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,791
It is his duty to report back
to his country.

813
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,624
And as king, it is your duty
to protect ours.

814
01:00:37,801 --> 01:00:40,214
I'm well aware of
my duties, General.

815
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:44,010
I cannot just let him die...

816
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:47,217
knowing we can save him.

817
01:00:47,394 --> 01:00:49,807
Where exactly are we taking him?

818
01:00:57,445 --> 01:01:00,233
Great! Another broken
white boy for us to fix.

819
01:01:00,407 --> 01:01:02,364
This is going to be fun.

820
01:01:09,457 --> 01:01:10,698
He will live.

821
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:16,332
W'Kabi is here.

822
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,973
What's going on, brother?
Where is Klaue?

823
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:30,009
He's not here.

824
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,102
He slipped through our hands.

825
01:01:37,694 --> 01:01:38,901
"Slipped"?

826
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:44,653
For 30 years, your father was
in power and did nothing.

827
01:01:44,826 --> 01:01:47,034
With you,
I thought it'd be different.

828
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,911
But it's more of the same.

829
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:11,433
Let's get going, boss.

830
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,811
You always sell to the CIA?

831
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:16,893
I sell to the highest bidder.

832
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:19,184
But don't you worry.
When I get back to Joburg...

833
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:20,713
and I lay low for a bit,

834
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,148
I'll make sure
both you guys get paid.

835
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,091
Oh, I ain't worried
about the money, bro.

836
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,105
I know you good for it.

837
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,929
On our way back,
just drop us off in Wakanda.

838
01:02:27,953 --> 01:02:29,013
You don't want to go there, boy.

839
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:30,027
Yeah, I do.

840
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:33,989
Drop it!

841
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,687
Or your little
Bonnie and Clyde routine

842
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,997
ends today.

843
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:39,537
Put your gun down now!

844
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:41,296
I'm sorry.

845
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,708
Sorry, Erik.
It's gonna be okay.

846
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:14,617
You really want to go
to Wakanda?

847
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,124
They're savages.

848
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:21,208
This is what they do
to people like us.

849
01:03:21,381 --> 01:03:22,542
I ain't worried about no brand.

850
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:24,173
Check these out.

851
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:26,876
Each one is for a kill.

852
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,053
You can scar yourself as much
as you'd like.

853
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,011
To them,
you'll just be an outsider.

854
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,471
You're crazy to think
that you can walk in there.

855
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:45,381
Ah, to think I saw you
as some crazy American.

856
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,913
Leave us!

857
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:15,341
So your mission did not go
as planned.

858
01:04:16,436 --> 01:04:20,100
What happened
to my uncle N'Jobu?

859
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:23,603
My father told me
he disappeared.

860
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,143
There was a man today...

861
01:04:27,072 --> 01:04:31,032
wearing a ring
identical to this one.

862
01:04:32,577 --> 01:04:34,569
That is not possible.

863
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:38,448
He helped Klaue escape from us
and he was wearing this ring!

864
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:40,867
My grandfather's ring!

865
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,646
Do not tell me what is possible.

866
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,706
Tell me the truth!

867
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:50,001
Some truths...

868
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,465
are too much to bear, T'Challa.

869
01:04:57,477 --> 01:04:59,969
That is not your choice to make.

870
01:05:00,855 --> 01:05:01,916
What happened to him?

871
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:03,476
I promised the king
to say nothing.

872
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:05,482
I am your king now!

873
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:23,413
Your uncle took...

874
01:05:24,671 --> 01:05:28,585
a War Dog assignment in America.

875
01:05:31,386 --> 01:05:32,593
Your father...

876
01:05:33,388 --> 01:05:35,095
placed me there...

877
01:05:35,974 --> 01:05:36,964
<i>to observe...</i>

878
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:40,643
unbeknownst to him.

879
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:43,725
Your uncle fell in love
with an American woman.

880
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,522
They had a child.

881
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,276
The hardships he saw there...

882
01:05:50,655 --> 01:05:52,738
radicalized your uncle.

883
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,115
I observed
for as long as I could.

884
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:57,943
Their leaders
have been assassinated.

885
01:05:58,121 --> 01:06:00,534
Communities flooded with drugs
and weapons.

886
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:03,074
They are overly policed
and incarcerated.

887
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,284
All over the planet...

888
01:06:05,462 --> 01:06:06,814
our people suffer because

889
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:08,830
they don't have the tools
to fight back.

890
01:06:09,841 --> 01:06:11,193
With vibranium weapons,

891
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,799
they could overthrow
every country...

892
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,822
and Wakanda could rule them all

893
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:16,132
the right way.

894
01:06:16,306 --> 01:06:19,845
He knew your father
would not support this.

895
01:06:20,727 --> 01:06:23,811
So, your uncle betrayed us.

896
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,187
No!

897
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,599
<i>He helped Klaue
steal the vibranium.</i>

898
01:06:30,153 --> 01:06:31,564
No, no, no.

899
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:33,320
You will return home at once...

900
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,322
where you will face
the Council...

901
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:38,451
and inform them of your crimes.

902
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,327
<i>He drew his weapon on me.</i>

903
01:06:40,497 --> 01:06:42,739
No!

904
01:06:57,847 --> 01:07:01,591
<i>Your father killed his own brother...</i>

905
01:07:01,768 --> 01:07:05,637
to save my life.

906
01:07:09,526 --> 01:07:12,644
Speak nothing of this.

907
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,316
And the child?

908
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,699
We left him.

909
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,292
We had to...

910
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:35,586
maintain...

911
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,339
the lie.

912
01:08:03,830 --> 01:08:05,241
What is this?

913
01:08:05,790 --> 01:08:07,281
Just a little gift.

914
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,310
Who are you?

915
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,190
All right, where am I?

916
01:09:23,743 --> 01:09:25,985
Don't scare me like that,
colonizer!

917
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,320
What?
My name is Everett.

918
01:09:28,748 --> 01:09:31,616
Yes, I know. Everett Ross...

919
01:09:31,793 --> 01:09:34,581
former air force pilot
and now CIA.

920
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,124
Right.

921
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,254
Okay, is this Wakanda?

922
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,044
No, it's Kansas.

923
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:48,887
How long ago was Korea?

924
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,176
Yesterday.

925
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,413
I don't think so.

926
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:53,791
Bullet wounds don't just
magically heal overnight.

927
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:56,023
They do here.

928
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:59,435
But not by magic, by technology.

929
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:07,072
Don't touch anything.
My brother will return soon.

930
01:10:30,810 --> 01:10:33,268
These train things...

931
01:10:33,438 --> 01:10:35,680
that's magnetic levitation,
right?

932
01:10:35,857 --> 01:10:36,893
Obviously.

933
01:10:37,066 --> 01:10:41,310
Obviously, but I've never
seen it this efficient.

934
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,067
The light panels, what are they?

935
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,741
<i>Sonic stabilizers.
Sonic what?</i>

936
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,405
In its raw form...

937
01:10:49,579 --> 01:10:51,265
vibranium is too dangerous

938
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,030
to be transported
at that speed...

939
01:10:53,207 --> 01:10:56,291
so I developed a way
to temporarily deactivate it.

940
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,911
<i>There's vibranium on those trains?</i>

941
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:01,296
There's vibranium all around us.

942
01:11:03,050 --> 01:11:04,632
That's how I healed you.

943
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:14,180
<i>Where is T'Challa?</i>

944
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,345
<i>His Kimoyo Beads
have been switched off.</i>

945
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:18,764
Well, we are not
joined at the hip, Okoye.

946
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,294
<i>A man showed up at the border</i>

947
01:11:20,318 --> 01:11:21,604
<i>who claims to have killed Klaue.</i>

948
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:22,838
What?

949
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,400
<i>W'Kabi is transporting him,
as we speak, to the palace.</i>

950
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,405
<i>We need to find your brother!</i>

951
01:11:27,575 --> 01:11:28,565
An outsider?

952
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:30,359
<i>No, a Wakandan.</i>

953
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:31,947
He's not a Wakandan.

954
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:35,789
He's one of ours.

955
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:50,842
He killed his own brother...

956
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:53,177
and left a child behind...

957
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:54,592
with nothing.

958
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:58,178
What kind of king...

959
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:02,269
What kind of man does that?

960
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:04,651
No man is perfect.

961
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:06,862
Not even your father.

962
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:09,739
He didn't even give him
a proper burial.

963
01:12:11,619 --> 01:12:14,703
My uncle N'Jobu betrayed us,
but my father...

964
01:12:16,123 --> 01:12:18,160
he may have created something
even worse.

965
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,574
Hey.

966
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,581
Look at me.

967
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:29,710
You can't let your father's
mistakes define who you are.

968
01:12:31,347 --> 01:12:35,967
You get to decide what kind of
king you are going to be.

969
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:44,649
<i>Brother, you need to
get here now!</i>

970
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:46,355
Erik Stevens.

971
01:12:47,071 --> 01:12:49,028
Graduated Annapolis age 19...

972
01:12:49,198 --> 01:12:51,110
MIT for grad school.

973
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,446
Joined the SEALs and went
straight to Afghanistan...

974
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,097
where he wrapped up
confirmed kills,

975
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:56,202
like it was a video game.

976
01:12:56,664 --> 01:12:58,405
Started calling him Killmonger.

977
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:01,246
He joined a JSOC ghost unit.
Now these guys are serious.

978
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,830
They will drop off the grid...

979
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,314
so they can
commit assassinations

980
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:05,454
and take down governments.

981
01:13:06,299 --> 01:13:09,667
Did he reveal anything
about his identity?

982
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:11,502
He has a War Dog tattoo...

983
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:14,762
but we have no record of him.

984
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,312
Is this man Wakandan or not?

985
01:13:24,567 --> 01:13:26,354
Tell us what is going on.

986
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:46,832
Speak.

987
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:48,246
Speak.

988
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:52,459
I'm standing in your house...

989
01:13:52,637 --> 01:13:54,072
serving justice to a man

990
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,383
who stole your vibranium
and murdered your people.

991
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,510
Justice your king
couldn't deliver.

992
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,606
I don't care
that you brought Klaue.

993
01:14:06,776 --> 01:14:09,171
Only reason I don't kill you
where you stand

994
01:14:09,195 --> 01:14:11,232
is because I know who you are.

995
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:14,193
Now, what do you want?

996
01:14:15,743 --> 01:14:17,512
I want the throne.

997
01:14:18,955 --> 01:14:20,223
My goodness.

998
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,958
Y'all sittin' up here
comfortable.

999
01:14:25,586 --> 01:14:27,077
Must feel good.

1000
01:14:27,797 --> 01:14:29,358
It's about two billion people

1001
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:30,998
all over the world
that looks like us.

1002
01:14:31,592 --> 01:14:33,549
But their lives
are a lot harder.

1003
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:36,006
Wakanda has the tools
to liberate 'em all.

1004
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,388
And what tools are those?

1005
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,638
Vibranium. Your weapons.

1006
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:45,430
Our weapons will not be used
to wage war on the world.

1007
01:14:45,731 --> 01:14:49,350
It is not our way to be judge,
jury and executioner...

1008
01:14:49,527 --> 01:14:51,359
for people who are not our own.

1009
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:53,403
Not your own?

1010
01:14:53,572 --> 01:14:56,030
But didn't life start
right here on this continent?

1011
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,611
So ain't all people your people?

1012
01:14:57,785 --> 01:15:01,404
I am not king of all people.
I am king of Wakanda.

1013
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,226
And it is my responsibility

1014
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,116
to make sure
our people are safe...

1015
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,563
and that vibranium does not fall

1016
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:10,374
into the hands
of a person like you.

1017
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:11,538
Mmm...
Son.

1018
01:15:12,091 --> 01:15:14,486
We have entertained
this charlatan for too long.

1019
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,342
Reject his request.

1020
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,004
Oh, I ain't requesting nothing.

1021
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:21,844
Ask who I am.
You're Erik Stevens.

1022
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:24,676
An American black operative.

1023
01:15:24,854 --> 01:15:26,623
A mercenary
nicknamed Killmonger.

1024
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:27,637
That's who you are.

1025
01:15:27,815 --> 01:15:29,351
That's not my name, Princess.

1026
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,100
Ask me, King.

1027
01:15:31,277 --> 01:15:32,438
No.

1028
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:34,687
Ask me.

1029
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,444
Take him away.

1030
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:40,900
Who are you?

1031
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:45,364
I am N'Jadaka,
son of Prince N'Jobu.

1032
01:15:46,500 --> 01:15:47,536
Son of N'Jobu?

1033
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:48,729
I found my daddy

1034
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:49,855
with Panther claws in his chest!

1035
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:51,962
You ain't the son of a king.
You a son of a murderer.

1036
01:15:52,131 --> 01:15:53,247
You're lying!

1037
01:15:53,424 --> 01:15:55,381
Lies!
I'm afraid not, Queen Mother.

1038
01:15:57,678 --> 01:15:58,964
What?

1039
01:16:01,432 --> 01:16:02,593
The descendent of N'Jobu.

1040
01:16:02,892 --> 01:16:04,303
Hey, Auntie.

1041
01:16:07,813 --> 01:16:09,791
I'm exercising my blood right

1042
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,477
to challenge
for the mantles of king...

1043
01:16:11,650 --> 01:16:13,232
and Black Panther.

1044
01:16:17,948 --> 01:16:19,314
Do not do this, T'Challa.

1045
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,720
As the son of Prince N'Jobu,

1046
01:16:21,744 --> 01:16:23,360
he is within his rights.

1047
01:16:23,537 --> 01:16:24,823
He has no rights here!

1048
01:16:24,997 --> 01:16:27,080
The challenge will take weeks
to prepare.

1049
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:30,458
Weeks? I don't need weeks.

1050
01:16:30,628 --> 01:16:32,870
The whole country ain't gotta
be there. I just need him.

1051
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:35,209
And somebody to get me
outta these chains.

1052
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:42,129
T'Challa,
what do you know of this?

1053
01:16:43,432 --> 01:16:45,890
I accept your challenge.

1054
01:17:04,036 --> 01:17:05,402
He'll never beat T'Challa.

1055
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:07,724
He should've just come
to the first challenge

1056
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:09,489
and gotten it over with.

1057
01:17:15,506 --> 01:17:17,943
The king will now have the strength

1058
01:17:17,967 --> 01:17:20,710
of the Black Panther
stripped away.

1059
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,996
Where is Agent Ross?

1060
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,913
I locked him in the office.
He's not going anywhere.

1061
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,297
This is your last chance.

1062
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,200
Throw down your weapons,

1063
01:18:07,224 --> 01:18:09,841
and we can handle this
another way.

1064
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:21,194
I lived my entire life
waitin' for this moment.

1065
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:25,073
I trained, I lied, I killed...

1066
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:26,949
just to get here.

1067
01:18:27,745 --> 01:18:31,329
I killed in America,
Afghanistan...

1068
01:18:33,209 --> 01:18:34,245
Iraq.

1069
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,772
I took life from
my own brothers and sisters

1070
01:18:37,796 --> 01:18:38,957
right here on this continent.

1071
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:43,086
And all this death...

1072
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:46,670
just so I could kill you.

1073
01:18:54,313 --> 01:18:57,522
Let the challenge begin.

1074
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,095
Yield!

1075
01:19:58,877 --> 01:20:00,209
Snap out of it, T'Challa!

1076
01:20:20,607 --> 01:20:21,597
Come on, get up.

1077
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:23,933
Come here.

1078
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:28,942
This is for my father.

1079
01:20:30,409 --> 01:20:31,695
Erik!

1080
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:34,118
Zuri, no.
Stop!

1081
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:35,703
Zuri!
Zuri, don't!

1082
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,865
I am the cause of
your father's death.

1083
01:20:38,042 --> 01:20:39,249
Not him.

1084
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:40,954
Take me.

1085
01:20:42,296 --> 01:20:43,878
I'll take you both, Uncle James.

1086
01:20:44,798 --> 01:20:46,443
No!

1087
01:20:46,467 --> 01:20:48,925
No! No!

1088
01:20:50,596 --> 01:20:51,632
Zuri, no!

1089
01:20:52,973 --> 01:20:53,963
No!

1090
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:57,809
No! No! Zuri! Zuri!

1091
01:20:58,312 --> 01:21:00,144
No! No!

1092
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,646
Is this your king? Huh?

1093
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,191
Is this your king?

1094
01:21:15,537 --> 01:21:17,098
The Black Panther,

1095
01:21:17,122 --> 01:21:18,909
who's supposed to
lead you into the future?

1096
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,574
Come on, Brother!

1097
01:21:20,751 --> 01:21:22,037
Is there nothing
that can be done?

1098
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:25,537
Him?

1099
01:21:26,632 --> 01:21:27,668
He's supposed to protect you?

1100
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:41,686
No.
No!

1101
01:21:49,196 --> 01:21:51,108
No!

1102
01:21:54,284 --> 01:21:56,697
Nah. I'm your king.

1103
01:21:56,870 --> 01:21:58,532
No! No!
We have to go now!

1104
01:21:58,705 --> 01:22:00,788
Queen Mother, let's go!

1105
01:22:36,618 --> 01:22:38,325
The Queen Mother and Shuri,
they are safe?

1106
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:40,223
Yes.

1107
01:22:40,247 --> 01:22:41,613
Thank you.

1108
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:44,157
We should get
to them immediately.

1109
01:22:44,585 --> 01:22:46,201
I cannot.

1110
01:22:46,378 --> 01:22:46,959
What?

1111
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:48,540
Though my heart is with you.

1112
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:52,318
We cannot turn over
our nation to a man

1113
01:22:52,342 --> 01:22:54,112
who showed up here
only hours ago.

1114
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,126
He is of royal blood.

1115
01:22:55,262 --> 01:22:57,549
He killed T'Challa!
In ritual combat.

1116
01:22:57,723 --> 01:22:59,555
Does that really matter?

1117
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,140
You are the greatest warrior
Wakanda has.

1118
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:09,311
Help me overthrow him
before he becomes too strong.

1119
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:10,601
Overthrow?

1120
01:23:11,528 --> 01:23:12,644
Nakia!

1121
01:23:14,114 --> 01:23:16,857
I'm not a spy who can come
and go as they so choose!

1122
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:23,080
I am loyal to that throne,
no matter who sits upon it.

1123
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,414
What are you loyal to?

1124
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,290
I loved him.

1125
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,002
I loved my country, too.

1126
01:23:34,176 --> 01:23:36,213
Then you serve your country.

1127
01:23:36,386 --> 01:23:39,550
No. I save my country.

1128
01:23:48,607 --> 01:23:49,643
What's wrong?

1129
01:23:49,983 --> 01:23:51,394
The king is dead.

1130
01:23:52,778 --> 01:23:54,690
Come with me,
unless you want to join him.

1131
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,007
First <i>Baba.</i>

1132
01:24:17,511 --> 01:24:19,093
And now my brother.

1133
01:24:21,932 --> 01:24:24,766
Mama, we didn't
even get to bury him.

1134
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:35,018
It's me.
Nakia. Who is this man?

1135
01:24:35,195 --> 01:24:37,027
He's a friend of T'Challa's.
He saved my life.

1136
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,300
Where's Okoye?

1137
01:24:39,324 --> 01:24:40,405
Okoye is not coming.

1138
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,319
She and the Dora Milaje
will serve the new king.

1139
01:24:49,251 --> 01:24:50,583
Wait here.

1140
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:56,964
What has happened
to our Wakanda?

1141
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:01,461
Allow the Heart-Shaped Herb...

1142
01:25:01,638 --> 01:25:04,597
to give you the powers
of the Black Panther...

1143
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:07,554
and take you
to the Ancestral Plane.

1144
01:26:42,739 --> 01:26:45,527
What did I tell you
about going into my things?

1145
01:26:45,909 --> 01:26:46,899
Hmm?

1146
01:26:52,833 --> 01:26:55,120
What did you find?

1147
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,455
Your home.

1148
01:26:59,798 --> 01:27:02,791
I gave you a key hoping that
you might see it someday.

1149
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:06,906
Yes. The sunsets there

1150
01:27:06,930 --> 01:27:08,717
are the most beautiful
in the world.

1151
01:27:11,059 --> 01:27:13,142
But I fear you still may not
be welcome.

1152
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:16,887
Why?

1153
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,729
They will say you are lost.

1154
01:27:21,319 --> 01:27:22,981
But I'm right here.

1155
01:27:26,908 --> 01:27:29,742
No tears for me?

1156
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,281
Everybody dies.

1157
01:27:37,335 --> 01:27:39,076
It's just life around here.

1158
01:27:43,508 --> 01:27:45,374
Well, look at what I have done.

1159
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:49,462
I should've taken you back
long ago.

1160
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,722
Instead, we are both
abandoned here.

1161
01:27:59,858 --> 01:28:02,441
Well, maybe your home
is the one that's lost.

1162
01:28:04,446 --> 01:28:06,859
That's why they can't find us.

1163
01:28:13,872 --> 01:28:16,285
Breathe!
Breathe, My King, breathe.

1164
01:28:16,458 --> 01:28:18,825
Breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

1165
01:28:35,644 --> 01:28:37,431
The Heart-Shaped Herb
did that?

1166
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:41,518
This all of it?

1167
01:28:41,691 --> 01:28:43,628
Yes. So when it comes time
for another king,

1168
01:28:43,652 --> 01:28:44,768
we will be ready.

1169
01:28:45,445 --> 01:28:46,686
Another king?

1170
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,941
Yeah, go ahead
and burn all that.

1171
01:28:51,117 --> 01:28:53,700
My King, we cannot do that.
It is our tradition...

1172
01:28:57,374 --> 01:29:00,333
When I tell you to do
something, I mean that shit.

1173
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,792
Burn it all!

1174
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,422
You know, where I'm from...

1175
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,579
when black folks
started revolutions,

1176
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,344
they never had the firepower...

1177
01:30:01,521 --> 01:30:03,604
or the resources
to fight their oppressors.

1178
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:05,848
Where was Wakanda?

1179
01:30:08,445 --> 01:30:09,435
Hmm?

1180
01:30:11,990 --> 01:30:13,697
Yeah, all that ends today.

1181
01:30:13,867 --> 01:30:16,985
We got spies embedded
in every nation on Earth.

1182
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,869
Already in place.

1183
01:30:19,039 --> 01:30:20,371
I know how colonizers think.

1184
01:30:20,540 --> 01:30:23,078
So we're gonna use their own
strategy against 'em.

1185
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:26,953
We're gonna send vibranium
weapons out to our War Dogs.

1186
01:30:27,130 --> 01:30:29,838
They'll arm oppressed people
all over the world...

1187
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,421
so they can finally rise up
and kill those in power.

1188
01:30:32,594 --> 01:30:34,322
And their children.

1189
01:30:34,346 --> 01:30:36,087
And anyone else
who takes their side.

1190
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,722
It's time they know
the truth about us!

1191
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,508
We're warriors!

1192
01:30:40,685 --> 01:30:43,849
The world's gonna start over,
and this time, we're on top.

1193
01:30:45,398 --> 01:30:48,766
The sun will never set
on the Wakandan empire.

1194
01:30:49,527 --> 01:30:52,190
Wakanda has survived for so long...

1195
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:55,653
by fighting when only
absolutely necessary.

1196
01:30:55,825 --> 01:30:58,442
Wakanda survived
in the past this way, yes.

1197
01:30:59,996 --> 01:31:02,204
But the world is changing,
General.

1198
01:31:02,958 --> 01:31:06,372
Elders, it is getting smaller.

1199
01:31:06,544 --> 01:31:08,410
The outside world
is catching up...

1200
01:31:08,588 --> 01:31:10,650
and soon it will be
the conquerors

1201
01:31:10,674 --> 01:31:12,757
or the conquered.

1202
01:31:14,719 --> 01:31:16,381
I'd rather be the former.

1203
01:31:18,556 --> 01:31:21,173
You heard your orders.
Let's get to it.

1204
01:31:22,936 --> 01:31:24,143
<i>So where are we going again?</i>

1205
01:31:24,312 --> 01:31:25,998
<i>We're taking the Heart-Shaped Herb</i>

1206
01:31:26,022 --> 01:31:27,012
<i>to Jabariland.</i>

1207
01:31:27,190 --> 01:31:28,806
Heart-Shaped Herb?
What is that?

1208
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:31,397
It gives whoever takes it
heightened abilities.

1209
01:31:31,569 --> 01:31:34,152
It's what made T'Challa
so strong.

1210
01:31:34,698 --> 01:31:35,734
Nakia.

1211
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,986
I don't like this.

1212
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:43,904
The Herb belongs to us.

1213
01:31:44,082 --> 01:31:47,291
We may be creating
a bigger monster with M'Baku.

1214
01:31:53,383 --> 01:31:57,127
Nakia, you should
take it yourself.

1215
01:31:57,721 --> 01:32:01,089
I am a spy with no army.

1216
01:32:02,475 --> 01:32:04,286
I wouldn't stand a chance.

1217
01:32:06,021 --> 01:32:07,512
We'll go.

1218
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,506
Oh, boy.

1219
01:32:20,744 --> 01:32:22,076
Oh, shit.

1220
01:32:23,204 --> 01:32:25,070
Look down. Stay calm.

1221
01:32:25,248 --> 01:32:26,238
Shuri.

1222
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:28,953
Look down.

1223
01:33:04,287 --> 01:33:05,573
My son...

1224
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:10,245
was murdered in ritual combat.

1225
01:33:10,710 --> 01:33:12,872
Were the odds fair?
Yes, but...

1226
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:14,628
So it was less a murder
than a defeat.

1227
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,664
Do not rub our noses in it!
Silence!

1228
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:20,425
I make
the pronouncements here, girl.

1229
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:23,324
Look, uh, Your Highness,
the new king is a U.S...

1230
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,223
The new king...

1231
01:33:35,068 --> 01:33:37,276
You cannot talk!

1232
01:33:37,445 --> 01:33:38,881
One more word,

1233
01:33:38,905 --> 01:33:41,147
and I will feed you
to my children.

1234
01:33:45,328 --> 01:33:47,536
I'm kidding.
We are vegetarians.

1235
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:58,047
Great Gorilla M'Baku...

1236
01:34:00,552 --> 01:34:03,841
this is why we are here.

1237
01:34:04,639 --> 01:34:06,801
To offer this to you.

1238
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,926
An outsider sits on our throne.

1239
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:11,935
Only you can help us stop him.

1240
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,825
Come with me.

1241
01:34:47,182 --> 01:34:49,219
Impossible!

1242
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,142
Is he breathing?

1243
01:34:56,316 --> 01:34:59,059
He's in a coma.
Barely clinging to life.

1244
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:01,172
<i>One of our fishermen found him</i>

1245
01:35:01,196 --> 01:35:02,812
<i>at the edge of the river border.</i>

1246
01:35:02,989 --> 01:35:04,275
<i>He brought him to me.</i>

1247
01:35:04,449 --> 01:35:06,190
Why do you have him in the snow?

1248
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:07,595
It is the only thing keeping him

1249
01:35:07,619 --> 01:35:08,655
from joining the ancestors.

1250
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:11,366
We need to get him to my lab.
I can heal him there.

1251
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,075
Take him.
He'll be dead in seconds.

1252
01:35:14,792 --> 01:35:16,408
Nakia, the Herb.

1253
01:35:33,311 --> 01:35:35,268
I call upon the ancestors.

1254
01:35:35,730 --> 01:35:37,687
I call upon Bast.

1255
01:35:38,191 --> 01:35:41,150
I am here with my son, T'Challa.

1256
01:35:42,195 --> 01:35:43,652
Heal him.

1257
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:58,542
We must bury him.
Cover him. Cover him!

1258
01:35:58,711 --> 01:35:59,952
Okay.

1259
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,390
Praise the ancestors.

1260
01:36:13,559 --> 01:36:14,549
Praise the ancestors.

1261
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:17,144
Praise the ancestors.

1262
01:36:18,189 --> 01:36:19,600
Praise the ancestors.

1263
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,107
Wake up, T'Challa.

1264
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,693
<i>Wake up.</i>

1265
01:36:27,198 --> 01:36:28,530
My son.

1266
01:36:34,956 --> 01:36:37,824
The time has come
for you to come home...

1267
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,414
and be reunited with me.

1268
01:36:51,389 --> 01:36:52,800
Why?

1269
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,018
Why didn't you
bring the boy home?

1270
01:36:59,772 --> 01:37:01,263
Why, <i>Baba?</i>

1271
01:37:03,109 --> 01:37:04,316
He...

1272
01:37:05,278 --> 01:37:08,567
He was the truth
I chose to omit.

1273
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:12,316
You were wrong to abandon him.

1274
01:37:12,493 --> 01:37:14,359
I chose my people.

1275
01:37:15,204 --> 01:37:17,742
I chose Wakanda.

1276
01:37:17,915 --> 01:37:19,781
Our future depended...

1277
01:37:19,959 --> 01:37:21,495
You were wrong!

1278
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:23,911
All of you were wrong!

1279
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,877
To turn your backs
on the rest of the world!

1280
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:32,197
We let the fear of our discovery

1281
01:37:32,221 --> 01:37:34,804
stop us from doing
what is right!

1282
01:37:35,892 --> 01:37:37,224
No more!

1283
01:37:41,022 --> 01:37:44,766
I cannot stay here with you.

1284
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:50,813
I cannot rest
while he sits on the throne.

1285
01:37:51,324 --> 01:37:54,362
He is a monster
of our own making.

1286
01:37:56,037 --> 01:37:59,371
I must take the mantle back.
I must!

1287
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:04,080
I must right these wrongs.

1288
01:38:14,931 --> 01:38:16,593
Do you have a blanket?

1289
01:38:19,394 --> 01:38:21,288
Killmonger has the full support

1290
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:22,473
of our military.

1291
01:38:24,607 --> 01:38:26,769
And he burned the garden
of the Heart-Shaped Herb.

1292
01:38:27,860 --> 01:38:29,046
Of course he did.

1293
01:38:29,070 --> 01:38:30,857
That's what he was
trained to do.

1294
01:38:31,030 --> 01:38:32,716
His unit used to work
with the CIA

1295
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:34,572
to destabilize
foreign countries.

1296
01:38:34,742 --> 01:38:36,825
They would always strike
at transitions of power...

1297
01:38:36,994 --> 01:38:39,156
like an election year,
or the death of a monarch.

1298
01:38:39,330 --> 01:38:41,697
You get control of government,
the military...

1299
01:38:41,874 --> 01:38:43,957
Our resources.
Right.

1300
01:38:45,086 --> 01:38:46,076
The Great Mound.

1301
01:38:46,254 --> 01:38:47,916
Our vibranium,
all of my designs.

1302
01:38:48,089 --> 01:38:50,752
He will send our weapons
all over the world.

1303
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,382
You must get them
out of Wakanda safely.

1304
01:38:56,556 --> 01:38:57,546
What?
What about you?

1305
01:38:58,474 --> 01:39:00,431
The challenge
will have to continue.

1306
01:39:00,601 --> 01:39:03,890
T'Challa, we will not
leave Wakanda.

1307
01:39:04,063 --> 01:39:06,055
It is my duty to keep you safe.

1308
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:08,794
If he gets control
of our technology,

1309
01:39:08,818 --> 01:39:10,150
nowhere will be safe.

1310
01:39:30,798 --> 01:39:32,710
The Black Panther lives.

1311
01:39:33,676 --> 01:39:35,759
And when he fights
for the fate of Wakanda...

1312
01:39:35,928 --> 01:39:38,466
I will be right there
beside him.

1313
01:39:39,599 --> 01:39:40,806
As will I.

1314
01:39:41,267 --> 01:39:42,508
I'm in, too.

1315
01:39:44,270 --> 01:39:46,353
What? You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

1316
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:51,061
Are you done?

1317
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:54,273
Are you done?

1318
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:58,987
Could you give me
and Lord M'Baku a moment?

1319
01:40:07,502 --> 01:40:08,618
Thank you.

1320
01:40:09,295 --> 01:40:11,537
I owed you a great debt.

1321
01:40:12,340 --> 01:40:13,922
A life for a life.

1322
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:15,627
Consider it paid.

1323
01:40:16,302 --> 01:40:18,510
Please allow my mother
to stay here.

1324
01:40:19,305 --> 01:40:22,218
No harm will come to her.
I give you my word.

1325
01:40:23,392 --> 01:40:26,055
You know, I could use
an army as well.

1326
01:40:26,229 --> 01:40:28,916
I bet you could.

1327
01:40:28,940 --> 01:40:30,181
But no.

1328
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:34,476
I will give no Jabari lives
towards your cause.

1329
01:40:34,654 --> 01:40:36,316
It is our cause.

1330
01:40:36,781 --> 01:40:39,239
It is for all of us.
Oh, us?

1331
01:40:39,408 --> 01:40:41,650
Us? You are the first king
to come here in centuries...

1332
01:40:41,827 --> 01:40:45,787
and now you speak of "us"?

1333
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,746
I cannot speak for past kings.

1334
01:40:50,378 --> 01:40:53,246
But an enemy sits
on the throne right now.

1335
01:40:53,422 --> 01:40:56,290
We both know the power
of vibranium.

1336
01:40:56,968 --> 01:40:59,112
If Killmonger
gains control of it,

1337
01:40:59,136 --> 01:41:01,093
who do you think
he will come for next?

1338
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:12,102
We will not help you.

1339
01:41:40,720 --> 01:41:41,881
Everything is on schedule.

1340
01:41:42,054 --> 01:41:43,215
Have the spies been alerted?

1341
01:41:43,389 --> 01:41:45,506
Yes. Some resistance
to our new mission.

1342
01:41:45,891 --> 01:41:47,452
But the War Dogs in London,

1343
01:41:47,476 --> 01:41:49,263
New York and Hong Kong
are standing by.

1344
01:41:50,938 --> 01:41:52,554
We'll strike there first.

1345
01:41:52,732 --> 01:41:54,519
The others'll come around.

1346
01:41:54,692 --> 01:41:56,058
Look at this.

1347
01:41:56,235 --> 01:41:57,379
A handheld sonic cannon,

1348
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:58,769
powerful enough
to stop a tank...

1349
01:41:58,946 --> 01:42:00,562
untraceable by metal detectors.

1350
01:42:00,740 --> 01:42:02,777
And we got thousands of them.

1351
01:42:04,952 --> 01:42:08,070
The world's gonna find out
exactly who we are.

1352
01:42:39,612 --> 01:42:40,819
He lives.

1353
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:46,779
N'Jadaka!

1354
01:42:47,995 --> 01:42:49,236
Wassup?

1355
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:51,154
I never yielded!

1356
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:55,626
And as you can see,
I am not dead!

1357
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,315
All that challenge shit
is over with!

1358
01:42:58,339 --> 01:42:59,455
I'm the king now!

1359
01:42:59,632 --> 01:43:01,840
Get those planes in the air!
Carry out the mission!

1360
01:43:10,309 --> 01:43:11,891
Shuri, now.
<i>Copy that.</i>

1361
01:43:15,272 --> 01:43:17,980
Go, go, go!
Come on, Ross!

1362
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:20,608
W'Kabi, man, kill this clown.

1363
01:43:21,737 --> 01:43:24,821
W'Kabi, the challenge
is not complete.

1364
01:43:28,869 --> 01:43:30,030
What will we do?

1365
01:43:31,455 --> 01:43:32,599
Border Tribe!

1366
01:43:46,595 --> 01:43:47,585
You!

1367
01:43:47,763 --> 01:43:50,096
Your heart
is so full of hatred...

1368
01:43:50,266 --> 01:43:52,098
you are not fit to be a king!

1369
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:57,596
Come on!

1370
01:43:57,773 --> 01:43:58,763
Ayo, the king!

1371
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,409
Shields!

1372
01:44:46,071 --> 01:44:47,061
Ah!

1373
01:44:50,534 --> 01:44:51,866
W'Kabi, stop this!

1374
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:54,611
Stop this now!

1375
01:44:58,793 --> 01:44:59,783
No!

1376
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:30,613
Nakia and I will get control
of the <i>Royal Talon</i> with this.

1377
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:32,240
So what do I do?

1378
01:45:32,409 --> 01:45:33,490
You'll have to fly it.

1379
01:45:34,370 --> 01:45:36,282
What?
You were a great pilot.

1380
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:38,492
Don't worry,
I'll guide you through it.

1381
01:45:38,666 --> 01:45:40,783
It's just like riding a hoverbike.

1382
01:45:41,502 --> 01:45:43,164
What? You guys
have hoverbikes?

1383
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:45,124
Hey, Nakia, take that.

1384
01:45:45,297 --> 01:45:48,040
I'm not a Dora.
Just put it on, it's armor!

1385
01:45:49,552 --> 01:45:50,588
Come!

1386
01:45:53,013 --> 01:45:54,174
Good luck, Agent Ross!

1387
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:55,784
Yeah, I don't know
what I'm doing with this.

1388
01:45:55,808 --> 01:45:57,174
We're counting on you.

1389
01:46:09,864 --> 01:46:11,299
Wakanda forever.

1390
01:46:19,456 --> 01:46:20,517
Come on!

1391
01:46:30,968 --> 01:46:32,084
Go, go!

1392
01:46:37,975 --> 01:46:40,843
<i>Remote piloting system activated.</i>

1393
01:46:41,896 --> 01:46:42,886
My God.

1394
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:46,101
<i>I made it American
style for you. Get in.</i>

1395
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:47,878
All right.

1396
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:54,981
Yes!

1397
01:46:57,077 --> 01:46:59,785
Go! We can't let those weapons
get beyond Wakanda.

1398
01:47:01,790 --> 01:47:02,826
All right, I'm on it.

1399
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:21,286
Lock!

1400
01:47:22,394 --> 01:47:23,601
Get him down!

1401
01:47:23,812 --> 01:47:25,394
Get the necklace!

1402
01:47:25,856 --> 01:47:27,438
Get the necklace!

1403
01:47:34,114 --> 01:47:36,197
Wakanda forever!

1404
01:47:43,999 --> 01:47:46,241
Okay, Shuri. I got 'em.
What do I do?

1405
01:47:46,418 --> 01:47:47,784
Shoot them down, genius!

1406
01:47:47,962 --> 01:47:48,952
All right.

1407
01:47:50,589 --> 01:47:51,625
Here goes nothing.

1408
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,005
All right, got them.

1409
01:48:04,353 --> 01:48:05,594
Oh, shit.

1410
01:48:06,563 --> 01:48:08,304
Shit, shit, shit.

1411
01:48:28,585 --> 01:48:29,666
Nice!

1412
01:49:04,913 --> 01:49:06,016
Shuri!

1413
01:49:10,252 --> 01:49:11,618
What's up, Princess?

1414
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:13,878
You'll never be a true king.

1415
01:49:16,842 --> 01:49:17,832
Brother!

1416
01:49:50,000 --> 01:49:51,286
Shuri.

1417
01:49:51,710 --> 01:49:52,700
Brother!

1418
01:49:53,587 --> 01:49:55,249
Turn on the train
on the bottom track.

1419
01:49:55,422 --> 01:49:57,459
<i>The stabilizers
will deactivate your suit!</i>

1420
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:58,965
You won't have protection!

1421
01:49:59,134 --> 01:50:00,466
Neither will he.

1422
01:50:00,636 --> 01:50:02,072
Okay!

1423
01:50:26,078 --> 01:50:28,320
I don't need a suit to kill you.

1424
01:50:28,497 --> 01:50:29,704
Your reign is over!

1425
01:50:29,873 --> 01:50:31,455
You sat up here,
safe and protected.

1426
01:50:31,625 --> 01:50:33,103
You want to see us become

1427
01:50:33,127 --> 01:50:35,039
just like the people
you hate so much.

1428
01:50:35,212 --> 01:50:36,953
Divide and conquer the land
as they did!

1429
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:39,544
Nah, I learn from my enemies.
Beat them at they own game.

1430
01:50:39,716 --> 01:50:40,957
You have become them!

1431
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:43,627
You will destroy the world,
Wakanda included!

1432
01:50:43,804 --> 01:50:45,545
The world took
everything away from me!

1433
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,213
Everything I ever loved!

1434
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:48,848
But I'mma make sure we're even.

1435
01:50:49,017 --> 01:50:50,203
I'mma track down
anyone who would

1436
01:50:50,227 --> 01:50:51,718
even think
about being loyal to you!

1437
01:50:51,895 --> 01:50:53,289
And I'm gonna put
they ass in the dirt

1438
01:50:53,313 --> 01:50:54,457
right next to Zuri!

1439
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,978
Nakia!

1440
01:51:01,113 --> 01:51:02,900
Are you all right?
I'm okay. You?

1441
01:51:03,073 --> 01:51:04,814
Yes.
Let's go.

1442
01:51:11,957 --> 01:51:14,244
Shuri, I've lost one of them,
but two are on my tail.

1443
01:51:16,670 --> 01:51:17,877
Shit. What the hell was that?

1444
01:51:18,046 --> 01:51:19,440
<i>The lab is under attack.</i>

1445
01:51:19,464 --> 01:51:20,567
What? Where?

1446
01:51:20,591 --> 01:51:22,503
<i>Deactivating hologram.</i>

1447
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:29,389
<i>Ross, you have to
get out of there, now!</i>

1448
01:51:29,975 --> 01:51:31,341
How long have I got?

1449
01:51:32,060 --> 01:51:35,098
<i>Glass integrity is at 50%.</i>

1450
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:36,934
Put me back in.

1451
01:51:37,107 --> 01:51:38,814
<i>Ross! Ross!</i>

1452
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:59,202
Surrender now!

1453
01:51:59,671 --> 01:52:02,539
You have three seconds
to lay down your weapon!

1454
01:52:02,716 --> 01:52:03,832
One!

1455
01:52:03,967 --> 01:52:04,957
Two!

1456
01:52:15,020 --> 01:52:19,334
Witness the might
of the Jabari firsthand!

1457
01:53:00,357 --> 01:53:02,690
<i>Glass integrity is at 15%.</i>

1458
01:53:11,576 --> 01:53:13,533
<i>Critical weapons failure.</i>
Shit!

1459
01:53:18,750 --> 01:53:20,436
Hey, Shuri!
The last cargo ship

1460
01:53:20,460 --> 01:53:21,701
is almost at the border...

1461
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,039
but they got me trapped
with some kind of cables.

1462
01:53:23,213 --> 01:53:24,499
Make an X with your arms!

1463
01:53:25,299 --> 01:53:27,507
<i>Sonic Overload initiated.</i>

1464
01:53:28,302 --> 01:53:29,509
Now break it!

1465
01:53:38,437 --> 01:53:40,349
<i>System rebooting in five...</i>

1466
01:53:40,814 --> 01:53:42,897
<i>four, three...</i>

1467
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,682
<i>two, one.</i>

1468
01:53:45,277 --> 01:53:46,393
<i>System rebooted.</i>

1469
01:53:58,707 --> 01:54:00,039
Yes! We did it!

1470
01:54:00,208 --> 01:54:01,744
<i>Great! Now get out of there!</i>

1471
01:54:12,929 --> 01:54:14,215
Charge!

1472
01:54:34,034 --> 01:54:36,367
Drop your weapon!

1473
01:54:37,913 --> 01:54:40,075
Would you kill me, my love?

1474
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:41,705
For Wakanda?

1475
01:54:45,003 --> 01:54:46,710
Without question!

1476
01:55:30,715 --> 01:55:32,251
This is it for you, Cousin.

1477
01:55:57,993 --> 01:55:59,529
Hell of a move!

1478
01:56:20,724 --> 01:56:22,368
My pop said Wakanda was

1479
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:23,974
the most beautiful thing
he ever seen.

1480
01:56:27,689 --> 01:56:30,181
He promised he was gonna
show it to me one day.

1481
01:56:31,860 --> 01:56:33,442
You believe that?

1482
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:35,506
Kid from Oakland,

1483
01:56:35,530 --> 01:56:37,396
running around
believing in fairy tales.

1484
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:27,701
It's beautiful.

1485
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:44,301
Maybe we can still heal you.

1486
01:57:46,726 --> 01:57:47,887
Why?

1487
01:57:49,688 --> 01:57:51,896
So you can just lock me up?

1488
01:57:55,151 --> 01:57:56,483
Nah.

1489
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,359
Just bury me in the ocean...

1490
01:58:00,532 --> 01:58:03,070
with my ancestors
that jumped from the ships.

1491
01:58:03,910 --> 01:58:07,278
'Cause they knew
death was better than bondage.

1492
01:59:31,831 --> 01:59:32,821
Thank you.

1493
01:59:34,834 --> 01:59:36,416
You saved me.

1494
01:59:37,337 --> 01:59:39,454
You saved my family.

1495
01:59:41,675 --> 01:59:43,086
Our nation.

1496
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:45,592
There's nothing to thank me for.

1497
01:59:45,762 --> 01:59:47,298
It is our duty to...

1498
01:59:50,934 --> 01:59:53,597
It was my duty to fight
for what I love.

1499
01:59:54,646 --> 01:59:55,636
I should've...

1500
02:00:02,362 --> 02:00:04,570
You can't blame me,
I almost died.

1501
02:00:08,243 --> 02:00:09,484
Stay.

1502
02:00:11,955 --> 02:00:13,265
I think I know a way

1503
02:00:13,289 --> 02:00:15,531
you can still fulfill
your calling.

1504
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:18,121
Please stay.

1505
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:52,985
Oh, he moves it!
He moves it!

1506
02:00:53,163 --> 02:00:54,825
Who man is that?
Bucket!

1507
02:00:54,998 --> 02:00:55,988
Easy.

1508
02:00:59,002 --> 02:01:00,396
When you said you would take me

1509
02:01:00,420 --> 02:01:02,332
to California
for the first time...

1510
02:01:02,505 --> 02:01:04,462
I thought you meant Coachella...

1511
02:01:04,632 --> 02:01:06,089
or Disneyland.

1512
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,171
Why here?

1513
02:01:11,306 --> 02:01:14,765
This is where our father
killed our uncle.

1514
02:01:19,981 --> 02:01:21,722
They're tearing it down.

1515
02:01:22,817 --> 02:01:23,807
Good.

1516
02:01:23,985 --> 02:01:25,977
They are not tearing it down.

1517
02:01:27,113 --> 02:01:28,729
I bought this building.

1518
02:01:30,784 --> 02:01:32,696
And that building.

1519
02:01:33,536 --> 02:01:35,277
And that one over there.

1520
02:01:36,498 --> 02:01:37,850
This will be the first

1521
02:01:37,874 --> 02:01:40,207
Wakandan International
Outreach Center.

1522
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:44,124
Nakia will oversee
the social outreach.

1523
02:01:44,881 --> 02:01:46,192
And you will spearhead

1524
02:01:46,216 --> 02:01:48,378
the science
and information exchange.

1525
02:01:49,093 --> 02:01:51,050
You're kidding.

1526
02:01:51,429 --> 02:01:52,715
Eh?

1527
02:02:01,981 --> 02:02:03,083
Oh...

1528
02:02:03,107 --> 02:02:06,020
Hey, yo.
Man, what the hell is that?

1529
02:02:06,194 --> 02:02:07,901
That's like a Bugatti spaceship!

1530
02:02:08,071 --> 02:02:10,654
Bro, it came out of nowhere.
Did y'all see that?

1531
02:02:13,785 --> 02:02:14,946
What?

1532
02:02:16,788 --> 02:02:17,778
Check it out, bro.

1533
02:02:17,956 --> 02:02:19,322
We can take this back
to the house.

1534
02:02:20,625 --> 02:02:21,769
Pull up to school in this.

1535
02:02:21,793 --> 02:02:23,813
Look, we can break it apart.
We can sell it.

1536
02:02:23,837 --> 02:02:24,897
On eBay.

1537
02:02:24,921 --> 02:02:26,002
Everybody get,
like, a million apiece.

1538
02:02:26,172 --> 02:02:27,483
I wouldn't do
that if I were you guys.

1539
02:02:27,507 --> 02:02:28,692
Where you come from?
From Wakanda.

1540
02:02:28,716 --> 02:02:29,902
What is a Wakanda?

1541
02:02:29,926 --> 02:02:30,916
Hey, yo!

1542
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:32,843
This yours?

1543
02:02:36,641 --> 02:02:37,973
Who...

1544
02:02:38,351 --> 02:02:39,512
Who are you?

1545
02:05:25,518 --> 02:05:27,680
<i>My name is King T'Challa...</i>

1546
02:05:27,854 --> 02:05:29,971
<i>son of King T'Chaka.</i>

1547
02:05:30,148 --> 02:05:34,483
<i>I am the sovereign ruler
of the nation of Wakanda.</i>

1548
02:05:34,652 --> 02:05:37,395
<i>And for the first time
in our history...</i>

1549
02:05:37,572 --> 02:05:40,781
<i>we will be sharing
our knowledge and resources...</i>

1550
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:42,816
<i>with the outside world.</i>

1551
02:05:42,994 --> 02:05:46,362
<i>Wakanda will no longer
watch from the shadows.</i>

1552
02:05:46,539 --> 02:05:47,950
<i>We cannot.</i>

1553
02:05:49,083 --> 02:05:50,574
<i>We must not.</i>

1554
02:05:50,918 --> 02:05:53,535
<i>We will work to be an example
of how we...</i>

1555
02:05:53,713 --> 02:05:55,955
<i>as brothers and sisters
on this earth...</i>

1556
02:05:56,132 --> 02:05:58,169
<i>should treat each other.</i>

1557
02:05:58,342 --> 02:06:00,174
<i>Now, more than ever...</i>

1558
02:06:01,429 --> 02:06:05,844
<i>the illusions of division
threaten our very existence.</i>

1559
02:06:06,267 --> 02:06:08,179
<i>We all know the truth.</i>

1560
02:06:08,352 --> 02:06:11,766
<i>More connects us
than separates us.</i>

1561
02:06:11,939 --> 02:06:13,646
<i>But in times of crisis...</i>

1562
02:06:13,816 --> 02:06:16,274
<i>the wise build bridges...</i>

1563
02:06:16,444 --> 02:06:19,232
<i>while the foolish
build barriers.</i>

1564
02:06:19,405 --> 02:06:21,442
<i>We must find a way...</i>

1565
02:06:21,616 --> 02:06:24,233
<i>to look after one another...</i>

1566
02:06:24,410 --> 02:06:29,121
<i>as if we were one, single tribe.</i>

1567
02:06:29,290 --> 02:06:30,747
<i>With all due respect,
King T'Challa...</i>

1568
02:06:30,917 --> 02:06:32,227
<i>what can a nation of farmers</i>

1569
02:06:32,251 --> 02:06:34,117
<i>have to offer
the rest of the world?</i>

1570
02:13:33,714 --> 02:13:35,775
Are you playing around
with that man again?

1571
02:13:35,799 --> 02:13:36,789
No.
You're teasing him again.

1572
02:13:38,219 --> 02:13:40,336
Don't wake him. He must rest.
No, I'm not.

1573
02:13:41,305 --> 02:13:42,671
No, I'm not.

1574
02:13:43,641 --> 02:13:44,848
Thabo, you're doing that.

1575
02:13:45,017 --> 02:13:46,383
He's doing it.
He's lying.

1576
02:13:46,560 --> 02:13:47,971
No, he's resting.

1577
02:13:48,270 --> 02:13:49,477
Go, go!

1578
02:13:49,647 --> 02:13:51,434
White Wolf!

1579
02:13:51,565 --> 02:13:52,601
Stop that!

1580
02:13:52,733 --> 02:13:53,849
White Wolf!

1581
02:13:56,612 --> 02:13:58,228
Good morning, Sergeant Barnes.

1582
02:13:59,740 --> 02:14:00,730
Bucky.

1583
02:14:02,368 --> 02:14:03,404
How are you feeling?

1584
02:14:04,036 --> 02:14:05,026
Good.

1585
02:14:07,665 --> 02:14:08,808
Thank you.

1586
02:14:08,832 --> 02:14:10,368
Come.

1587
02:14:11,877 --> 02:14:13,743
Much more for you to learn.

1587
02:14:14,305 --> 02:15:14,745
