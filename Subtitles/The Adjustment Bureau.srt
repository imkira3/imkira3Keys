and the next senator
from the state of New York,

3
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,475
David Norris!

4
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,895
Thank you. Thank you.

5
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,647
Well, hi, there.

6
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:06,315
My name is David Norris,

7
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,569
and I'd like to be the
next senator from the
great state of New York.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,072
Look at you.
What's your name?

9
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,574
I'm going to go
through Yonkers,
door to door

10
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:16,701
and take the city that way.
We love you.

11
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:18,453
The recent endorsement
by the fire fighter's union

12
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:19,912
is another boost to Norris

13
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:21,706
who already had
a six-point lead

14
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,249
over his opponent,
Roger Linfield.

15
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:27,211
Whenever I see
you on C-Span,
and you stand,

16
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,672
I always think you're
about to go, "Chug!”

17
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:32,258
Congressman,
you certainly started
your career off,

18
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:35,553
eight years ago, with a bang
or should I say, a bust.

For the last eight years,

21
00:01:56,033 --> 00:02:00,620
David Norris has
represented Brooklyn,
New York City and America.

22
00:02:00,704 --> 00:02:02,872
This is my
campaign chairman,
Charlie Traynor.

23

These are voters.

24

Latest polls have
you up 10 points.

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,752
DAVID: We're 10 points up?

26
00:02:07,878 --> 00:02:09,670
This is not going to be
easy getting there.

27
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,172
I have some
real opposition,

28
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,507
and what they're
saying about me

29
00:02:12,591 --> 00:02:14,592
is that I'm too young
to hold this office.

30
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,177
Win big, but run
like you're 20 down.

31
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,386
Okay, you got it.

32
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,471
Thank you, Gary.

33
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:20,306
DAVID:
But that's okay because
these are the same people

34
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,517
who say that young
people don't vote,

35
00:02:22,601 --> 00:02:24,894
young people don't
care about politics,

36
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,479
but I'm here to tell you,

37
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:29,482
your future is about
your choices, not theirs.

38
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,818
So, today I'd like
to put them on notice

39
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:34,737
because come November,
I want them to know

40
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:36,739
that it was young
people like you,

41
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:38,825
who kicked their asses.

NEWSCASTER: David Norris,

55
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:54,525
until recently,
he was way ahead
in the polls.

56
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,111
Mary Matalin and
James Carville are here.

00:03:57,195 --> 00:03:59,655
Mary, this is a surprise.

58
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,741
MARY: It is a surprise.
Such political promise.

59
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:04,410
This compelling story,
he grew up in a rough
neighborhood in Brooklyn.

60
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,454
He overcame the loss
of his entire family,

61
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,331
his mom and his brother
when he was 10,

62
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:10,917
his father before
he got to high school,
he got over that.

63
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:12,168
He had such promise.

64
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,879
And he was the
youngest person

65
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,881
ever elected to the
House of Representatives.

66
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,675
JAMES: Yeah, he was elected
when he was actually 24,

67
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,803
but he gets in
a bar room fight
the night that he's elected.

68
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,263
I like this, all right.

69
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,724
Then you have this
photo coming out
of the New York Post.

70
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,935
I think the accretion
of this stuff

71
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,395
was just too much
for the voters.

72
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,440
It reeked of some
level of immaturity here,

73
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:35,733
of impulsiveness.

74

they want adults in Congress.

You should take a vacation
when all this is finished.

You've earned it.

I'm not sure the
kind of tired I am

81
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:07,890
can be fixed by a vacation.

I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

I just didn't know
what to do.

132
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,415
I heard you come in
and say, "Hello,"

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,126
and I probably should
have said, "Hi,"

but then I thought
that would be weird

135
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:43,838
because it's the men's.

136
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:47,133
Then you started
talking to yourself

00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,759
and it was obviously
very personal.

got to be too much,

mooning your friends

is no big deal.

used you on my team

171
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,212

172
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:07,379

out of your mouth
before you say it.

stuff I can relate to.

176

pants down?

wouldn't even get elected

Oh, I wish.

00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:27,900
That would have been
my other favorite moment
of your campaign.

183

Do you still
have a chance?

you're never really alone

just looking forward

been more convincing.

When you got in a fight,

It's bullshit.

240

We didn't have that saying
in my neighborhood.

241
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,419
It's just one
of those phrases

242
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,089
that had some traction
with the focus group

243
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,134
and so we kept using it,
but it's not true.

cover story for GQ.

The title was
"Youngest Congressman Ever."

246
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:48,183
And since then,
every story has tried

247
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:51,145
to explain how
I got here so fast.

248

people kept using
was "authentic."

Go get Jim for me.
This tie was selected for me

253
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,460
by a group of specialists
in Tenafly, New Jersey

who chose it over
56 other ties we tested.

In fact, our data suggests
that I have to stick to

256
00:13:23,094 --> 00:13:26,847
either a tie that is red
or a tie that is blue.

257
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:30,559
A yellow tie made it look
as if I was taking
my situation lightly,

and I may in fact,
pull my pants down
again at any moment.

A silver tie meant that
I'd forgotten my roots.

My shoes...

262

high-priced lawyers
and bankers.

If you want to get
a working man's vote,

265
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,164
you need to scuff up
your shoes a little bit.

266
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,665
But you can't scuff
them up so much

267
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,334
that you alienate
the lawyers
and the bankers

268
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:58,587
because you need them
to pay for the specialists
back in Tenafly.

269
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,757
So, what is the proper
scuffing amount?

270
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,969
Do you know we actually paid
a consultant $7,300...

Was it $7,300, Charlie?

Nice. What an asshole.

273

00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,550
(PANTING)

479
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:55,094
I don't really know
what's going on here.

480
00:25:55,304 --> 00:25:56,596
You've just seen
behind a curtain

481
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,765
that you weren't supposed
to know existed.

482
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,059
Must be jarring.

483
00:26:01,143 --> 00:26:02,602
It's not your fault.

484
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,062
Your path through
the world this morning

485
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,688
was supposed
to have been adjusted.

486
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:07,607
You were supposed
to spill your coffee

487
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,651
as you entered
the park this morning.

488
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,277
You would have gone
upstairs to change,

489
00:26:11,362 --> 00:26:12,737
you would have
missed the bus,

490
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:15,073
and you would have
arrived at work

491
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:17,075
10 minutes later
than you did,

492
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,785
and we would
have been gone.

493
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,745
I was supposed
to spill my coffee?

494
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,997
We call that
an adjustment.

495
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,124
See, sometimes, when
people spill their coffee

496
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,459
or their Internet goes out

497
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:29,170
or they misplaced their keys,
they think it's chance.

498
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,089
And sometimes it is.

499
00:26:31,215 --> 00:26:33,341
Sometimes it's us...
(TIRES SQUEALING)

500
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,718
...nudging people
back on plan.

501
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,013
Sometimes when
nudging isn't enough,

502
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,100
management authorizes
a recalibration.

503
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:44,894
We deploy our
Intervention Team

504
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,146
and they change
your mind for you,

505
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,691
like we did with
your friend Charlie.

506
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,361
He's fine, by the way.

507
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:54,946
You don't need
to worry about him.

508
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,447
Now...

509
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,618
There is something
I need you to understand
if I'm going to let you go.

510
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:02,453
Okay.

511
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:04,247
Very few humans have seen
what you've seen today,

512
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:05,707
and we're determined
to keep it that way.

513
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:09,252
So, if you ever
reveal our existence,

514
00:27:10,004 --> 00:27:11,838
we'll erase your brain.

515
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:14,382
The Intervention
Team will reset you.

516
00:27:14,717 --> 00:27:16,884
Your emotions,
your memories,

517
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:19,721
your entire personality
will be expunged.

518
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,973
Your friends and family will
think you've gone crazy.

519
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,852
You won't think anything.

520
00:27:31,442 --> 00:27:33,234
You understand?

521
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:37,739
Not one word about us.

522
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,158
Okay.

523
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:43,870
Oh, one more thing,
you bumped into a woman
this morning on the bus.

524
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:45,038
Elise?

525
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:47,874
What does that have
to do with anything?

526
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,001
You were never supposed
to see her again.

527
00:27:52,046 --> 00:27:54,088
What does that matter?

528
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:55,923
Because it matters.

529
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:59,344
McCRADY: It's in his wallet.
Hey, hey. God! Hey!

530
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,264
What's with you guys?
Jesus!

531
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,354
Oh, come on. No! No!

532
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,564
What the hell?

533
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:14,275
Really?

534
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:17,528
What the hell?

535
00:28:18,572 --> 00:28:20,198
Okay.

536
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:23,993
Okay.
Take him back.

537
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,119
Enjoy the rest
of your day.

538
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,622
I can walk.
I'm capable of walking.

539
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:42,136
Dude, what are you
doing on my floor?

540
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,972
You know,
I called you like 10 times,
you could have picked up.

541
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,937
Christine, I found him.
He's in my office.

542
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,355
What the hell
are you doing?

543
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:57,235
Round up the guys,
we're going to do
the meeting now.

544
00:28:58,487 --> 00:28:59,654
You have a headache?

545
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,489
What is wrong with you?

546
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:07,954
Hey, we're in
the big conference room
on 17. Let's go.

547
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,506
Morning, Congressman.

548
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:21,217
You sure you're okay?

549
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,927
Yeah, you?

550
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:24,137
I'm great, why?

551
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,847
You don't have
a headache or anything?

552
00:29:25,931 --> 00:29:27,765
No, I feel fantastic, man.

553
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:30,351
Is it me or this
an odd conversation?

554
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:32,145
WOMAN: On David's
solar panel deal,

555
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,563
our tech guy has
serious doubts

556
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:35,690
about the efficiency
ratings they're claiming.

557
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,984
They'd need
a 20-fold improvement
over anything anyone else

558
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:41,571
has been able to manufacture
at that price point to really
be a game-changer.

559
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,866
MAN: You're opposed
to this anyway, Charlie.
And with these financials...

560
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:47,034
CHARLIE: Whoa, whoa.
I know it's a risk,

561
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,205
but if our company doesn't
take a chance on something
like this, then who will?

562
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:55,293
I mean, I'm willing to take
a fire on something that
could change the world.

563
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:59,547
Not to mention,
be incredibly lucrative.

564
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,304
David?

565
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,561
Yeah, I mean, it's why
I took the job here.

566
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,481
CHARLIE: All right.

567
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,399
Let's do it.

568
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,322
Come into my office
for a second.

569
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,953
Something is wrong.

570
00:30:31,413 --> 00:30:34,499
A couple of hours ago
you miraculously reunite
with the girl of your dreams.

571
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,418
Explain to me why
you don't have an
ear-to-ear grin right now.

572
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,344
I lost her number.

573
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,512
What?

574
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:51,474
The woman on the bus.

575
00:30:51,558 --> 00:30:56,562
I lost her phone number
and all I had was
her first name, so,

576
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,483
I'm never going
to see her again.

577
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:04,445
I'm sorry.

578
00:31:05,113 --> 00:31:07,114
Wow, I'm really sorry.

579
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:54,787
HARRY: Your entire world
is turned upside down

580
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,123
and you're thinking
about a woman.

581
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,751
Even if you could
remember the number,

582
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:02,336
you'll never get through.

583
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,630
Lost cell phone,
changed numbers,

584
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:07,008
whatever creates
the fewest ripples.

585
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,260
My name is Harry,
by the way.

586
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:12,722
The fewest ripples?

587
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,352
You freeze people.
You froze my friend.

588
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:20,313
We need special
authorization to...

589
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:21,939
Poke around in
people's brains.

590
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,107
You make them think
whatever you want...

591
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,400
Be quiet, David.

592
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:25,526
Can I get you something?

593
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,528
Just some water, please.

594
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:29,655
Your friend will be fine.

595
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:34,076
Recalibrations make
tiny changes in the
way people reason.

596
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:36,787
It doesn't work on
emotion or personality.

597
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,456
That's too intrusive.

598
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,916
You said authorization.
Authorization from who?

599
00:32:41,001 --> 00:32:42,251
The Chairman.

600
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,336
The Chairman?

601
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,462
(SHUSHING)

602
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,797
That's just
a name we use.

603
00:32:47,424 --> 00:32:49,634
You use many other names.

604
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,430
We can't talk here.

605
00:32:56,391 --> 00:33:00,186
Meet me on the 4:00 p.m. boat
and I'll answer what I can.

606
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,649
If you reveal us,
even if it's
unintentional...

607
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,484
I know. You'll bump
me on the head.

608
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:10,571
Richardson has automatic
authority to reset you.

609
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,491
You mean lobotomize me?

610
00:33:13,575 --> 00:33:15,534
Try not to forget it.

611
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:17,411
Be on the 4:00 p.m. boat.

612
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:37,390
Ask your questions,
I'll tell you what I can.

613
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,267
What were they
doing to Charlie?

614
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,187
Just changing the way
he weighs investment risks

615
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:47,441
which will subtly shift
the direction of his company
in the way upstairs wants.

616
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,694
So, Richardson could
read my mind?

617
00:33:49,778 --> 00:33:51,654
Richardson was trying
to scare you.

618
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,365
No, he knew the number
I was thinking of,
the color.

619
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,200
Because he set it up
as a choice.

620
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,452
"Choose a color,
choose a number."

621
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:01,497
We can't read your mind
or hear your thoughts.

622
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:05,209
When you make a decision,
your mind weighs options.

623
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,627
We can perceive them.

624
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,338
We know when
you're going to go off
the plan or not because

625
00:34:09,423 --> 00:34:10,965
if we're close enough,

626
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,967
we can sense when
it's going to happen.

627
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:15,136
We're just here
to keep you on plan.

628
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,096
That's all we're
authorized to do.

629
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:19,390
Are you allowed to be
telling me this stuff?

630
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,350
Are they following me now?

631
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,477
We have to monitor
the entire world.

632
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,523
We don't have
the manpower to follow
everyone all the time.

633
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,526
And there is
something about water.

634
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,487
It blocks our ability
to read your decision tree.

635
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,614
Are you an angel?

636
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,825
We've been called that.

637
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,202
We're more like
case officers

638
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:43,038
who live a lot longer
than humans.

639
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:44,707
Why are you helping me?

640
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,417
I have my reasons.

641
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,670
And why won't they
let me be with Elise?

642
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,758
All I know is
the amount of resources
they've used

643
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:57,511
keeping you from her
is pretty damn
important to them.

644
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,807
You're going to look
for her, aren't you?

645
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,643
You won't find her.

646
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:06,854
They'll make sure of it.

647
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,940
Even if they weren't
trying to stop you,

648
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:13,110
there are nine million
people in this city.

649
00:35:13,195 --> 00:35:15,196
You'll never find her.

650
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:18,282
Forget about her.

651
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:20,367
Move on with your life.

652
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,465
(ALARM BEEPING)

653
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,700
Stop!
Stop the bus!

654
00:36:56,965 --> 00:36:58,966
Elise? Elise, hi.

655
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,759
David.

656
00:37:00,844 --> 00:37:04,805
You know, I rode
the M6 to work every
day for three years

657
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:07,474
hoping that I'd
bump into you.

658
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,936
Listen, is there a place
we could go and talk?

659
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:12,688
(SIGHING)

660
00:37:12,814 --> 00:37:15,399
Don't you have to get
to work or something?

661
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
I just got sick.

662
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,485
"I haven't seen you
in three years,
you make me sick."

663
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,446
That's not an ideal come-on,
just so you know.

664
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:21,697
What are you looking for?
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

665
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,657
I felt like someone
was watching us.

666
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,327
Hey, Charlie,
I'm going to have
to skip breakfast,

667
00:37:26,411 --> 00:37:29,330
and I probably have to
postpone the speech, too.
I just bumped into Elise.

668
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:30,915
You just hung up
on your friend.

669
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:32,374
We've known each other
since we were kids.

670
00:37:32,459 --> 00:37:33,751
What speech?
It doesn't matter.

671
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:35,753
You want to take a walk?
No.

672
00:37:35,837 --> 00:37:36,879
We have a lot
to catch up on.

673
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,255
I don't think you should
cancel your speech.

674
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,341
What if I don't like you
at the end of our walk?

675
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:41,800
I'll take my chances.

676
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:43,427
Seriously, my number
hasn't changed,

677
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,512
just call me like
you didn't last time.

678
00:37:45,597 --> 00:37:48,349
Look, if you take
a walk with me,
I'll explain why.

679
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,645
It's been years.
How do you know I don't
have a nice boyfriend?

680
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,605
Do you have
a nice boyfriend?

681
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,023
Would it matter if I did?

682
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,107
Yeah.

683
00:37:57,192 --> 00:37:59,109
So you don't have any
real conviction then?

684
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,486
Okay, it wouldn't
matter at all.

685
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,613
So, you don't mind
being a home-wrecker?

686
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,781
MAN: Congressman!

687
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,283
How are you doing, man?
I'm from Red Hook.
You're the best.

688
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,327
Thank you.
Good to see you.

689
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:11,789
If you were married,
then it would bother me.

690
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,959
But now you're
just saying what you
think I want to hear.

691
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,961
I'm single.

692
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,964
Now let's hear
your bullshit excuse
for not calling me.

693
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,090
I didn't have your number.

694
00:38:21,174 --> 00:38:22,758
I gave it you on the bus.
Handed it to you.

695
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,760
I was mugged.
It was taken from me.

696
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,011
No, come on.

697
00:38:26,096 --> 00:38:28,389
My wallet was taken.
Come on.

698
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,349
Why else would I fawn
all over you on a bus

699
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,809
three years ago and
then never call you?

700
00:38:31,893 --> 00:38:34,812
Because, I don't know!
You have a girlfriend
and you felt terrible.

701
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:38,607
Listen, I swear to you
that I did not have
your number.

702
00:38:38,692 --> 00:38:39,733
All right.

703
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:42,361
No, on my
parents' graves.

704
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,445
That's heavy.

705
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:44,905
That's too heavy,
I know, but it's true.

706
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,573
I didn't have your number.

707
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,492
And I didn't even have
a last name to go by.

708
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,619
If you google just "Elise,"

709
00:38:50,704 --> 00:38:53,914
you get 757,000 hits.
You did not.

710
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:55,457
And none of them are you.

711
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,220
We have a problem.

712
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,596
What?

713
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,140
David Norris is off plan.

714
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,977
(SIGHS) Son of a bitch.
How did he find her?

715
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,813
Chance. Just spotted
her on the street.

716
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:20,065
We never should
have let him meet her
in the first place.

717
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,359
We followed protocol
to the letter.

718
00:39:22,444 --> 00:39:25,070
Guy rides the same bus
every day for three years.

719
00:39:25,155 --> 00:39:26,655
Who does that?

720
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,244
Three years later,
I'm still cleaning up
your mess.

721
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,543
(CHATTERING)

722
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:42,504
Let's cut the power
at her dance studio.

723
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:44,506
I'm a dancer.

724
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:45,591
Oh.

725
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,301
Not like that,
you pervert.

726
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:49,053
I'm in a contemporary
ballet company.

727
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,763
I think you have
the wrong idea about me.

728
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:53,432
No, I think that was
the first thing that
crossed your mind, actually.

729
00:39:53,558 --> 00:39:55,976
I think you should
invite me to one
of your performances.

730
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:57,853
The company is
called Cedar Lake,

731
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:01,065
and there is actually
a show tomorrow
night, if you want.

732
00:40:01,149 --> 00:40:03,192
Is that an invitation?
No, it's information.

733
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:05,027
We're covering the girl's
artistic director

734
00:40:05,153 --> 00:40:07,071
and we're still working
on Charlie Traynor.

735
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,989
This whole thing will
be over in an hour.

736
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,158
DAVID: Hi, how are you?
Paul, right?

737
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,409
PAUL: How did
you remember that?

738
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:13,911
DAVID: I'm a politician,
I'm good with names.

739
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,121
Her decision tree
is diverging
from our models.

740
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:17,206
PAUL: It's just
the two of you?

741
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,499
DAVID: Yes.

742
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,042
RICHARDSON:
Thirty-six hours
without contact,

743
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:21,376
she'll never speak
to him again.

744
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:22,503
Look at her file.

745
00:40:22,587 --> 00:40:24,838
It's the last thing
in the world
she'll put up with.

746
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,050
No, something's wrong.
I'm already seeing
inflection points.

747
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,510
(RICHARDSON SIGHING)

748
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,471
You okay?

749
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,847
Yeah.

750
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,937
We're in motion on
changing the location
of her rehearsal.

751
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,065
You have to be born
with the right body

752
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,110
like very flexible hips
and shoulders and long neck.

753
00:40:46,194 --> 00:40:47,194
And you weren't?

754
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,946
No, I was.
I was lucky.

755
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:52,533
But after 15 years
of that precision
and the training...

756
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:53,784
How is everything
over here?

757
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,202
It's great. Thank you.

758
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:57,037
It's good,
thank you.

759
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,126
ELISE: So, I wanted
to try something else
just on my own,

760
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,878
open-ended and
human, I guess.

761
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,713
DAVID: What do you mean?

762
00:41:07,757 --> 00:41:08,882
Look.

763
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,469
What's this?

764
00:41:12,554 --> 00:41:14,012
If they kiss.

765
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,807
A kiss?
That's all it takes?

766
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:17,975
A real kiss.

767
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,685
If that happens,
every possible
adjustment

768
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:20,853
strong enough
to break them up

769
00:41:20,937 --> 00:41:23,522
will cause ripples
over your limit.

770
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:24,648
(SIGHING)

771
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,191
I think that everything
you go through in life

772
00:41:26,276 --> 00:41:28,318
should come out
in the way that
you dance.

773
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:30,279
I haven't found
that to be the case
with my dancing.

774
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:31,655
(LAUGHING)

775
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,448
ELISE: It's a shame.

776
00:41:33,867 --> 00:41:36,493
David,
hate to interrupt.

777
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,495
Hi.
Hi, nice to see
you again, Elise.

778
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,663
How did you find me?

779
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:40,914
Does it matter?

780
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:42,833
Nice work.

781
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,169
CHARLIE: There's a crowd
of people waiting for your
announcement speech

782
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,545
at the Brooklyn Bridge
right now.

783
00:41:46,629 --> 00:41:48,672
You're announcing today?
You can't skip this for me.

784
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:51,341
I know. I told you
I'm not going to let
you out of my sight.

785
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,302
David, what the hell?
Do you want to come?

786
00:41:53,386 --> 00:41:54,511
Do you want to watch?

787
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,097
No. I can't, I have
to go and rehearse.

788
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:59,016
Actually, I just heard
that they're moving
my rehearsal

789

All he needs to do is
see her dance and you're
at your ripple limit.

949
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:34,197
What? All right,
block the door.

950
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,407
He's already
through it.

951
00:50:35,491 --> 00:50:36,700
Not that one,
the next one.

952
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:37,951
Excuse me.

953
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,786
David Norris,
I'm here to see Elise.

954
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:41,663
I'm blocking them all.

955
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,499
Hat! Hat!

956
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,710
Is she here?
Yeah, she's in the studio.

957
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:54,300
McCRADY: It's too late.
He's already seen her.

958
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:57,554
You hit your ripple limit.

959
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,931
Celebrate now.

960
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,225

to kick it upstairs.

It's Donaldson.

962
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,818
He has no idea

00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,990
Let's take a walk.

965
00:52:04,872 --> 00:52:07,582
The intense chemistry
between them,

966
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:09,542
the constant
inflection points,

967
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:12,128
and the kicker,
you pulling them
apart twice

968
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,881
only to have chance
put them back together.

969
00:52:15,716 --> 00:52:17,550
Yeah, all that
seemed a little much.

970
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,346
So, I asked Burdensky
to do some research
this morning.

971
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,474
Have you been
in here before?

972
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:26,184
No, of course not.

973
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,436
It seems
like David Norris
and Elise Sellas

974
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:29,521
were meant to be together

975
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:32,440
because they were
meant to be together.

976
00:52:33,317 --> 00:52:34,651
Wait, what?

977
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,069
DONALDSON:
In the '70s
when he was born,

978
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:37,487
they were meant
to be together,

979
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,948
same thing
in the '80s, '90s.

980
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:42,575
Wasn't till 2005
that the plan changed

981
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,787
and she was supposed
to stay with Adrian.

982
00:52:51,752 --> 00:52:54,879
The problem here
is there are remnants
from all those old plans

983
00:52:54,964 --> 00:52:57,423
that keep pushing
them together.

984
00:52:57,508 --> 00:53:00,718
They still feel like
they belong with each other
even though they don't,

985
00:53:00,803 --> 00:53:03,513
and we're about to tear
them apart again.

986
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:19,821
You spend
your whole career

987
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,074
hoping, someday,
you'll get a red-letter case.

988
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:26,119
Something you can
really make a name
for yourself with.

989
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,163
Finally you get one,

990
00:53:29,582 --> 00:53:31,040
and it's booby-trapped.

991
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,792
What?

992
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:35,628
I'm saying,
it wasn't your fault.

993
00:53:36,797 --> 00:53:38,339
They were meant
to be together.

994
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:39,883
What?

995
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:42,468
Were. In an earlier
version of the plan.

996
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,804
Actually, a dozen
earlier versions.

997
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,267
I always wondered
how we had such bad luck

998
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:53,980
that she was on
that particular bus
on that particular day.

999
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:56,608
How could a plan
just change like that?

1000
00:53:56,734 --> 00:53:58,651
I don't know.

1001
00:53:58,736 --> 00:54:01,446
It's above my pay grade.

1002
00:54:01,822 --> 00:54:03,323
So, we're going
operational.

1003
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:04,908
This is exciting.
It's been a while.

1004
00:54:05,034 --> 00:54:08,369
We're not
going operational.

1005
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:12,999
No one ever made it
to my job by taking
stupid risks.

1006
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:14,792
So, what are
we going to do?

1007
00:54:14,877 --> 00:54:16,711
We're going to kick
this case upstairs

1008
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,797
to someone with
the latitude
to clean up this mess

1009
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,466
without breaking
into a sweat.

1010
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:23,635
We're going to bring
this to Thompson.

1011
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,969
Thompson?

1012
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,764
When he was in the field,
his nickname was...

1013
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:29,474
"The Hammer," yes.

1014
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:32,852
He'll crush this
little romance with
a flick of his hand

1015
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:34,562
and force them
back on plan again.

1016
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,606
I want to go to a club.

1017
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,775
Oh! Why ruin
a really nice day?

1018
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:40,610
Come on.
No, I don't dance.

1019
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,613
Everyone can dance.
You just feel the music.

1020
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:46,407
Well, I've been
told that I have
trouble feeling.

1021
00:54:46,492 --> 00:54:47,951
Who told you that?

1022
00:54:48,035 --> 00:54:49,953
A long list of women.

1023
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:51,204
That's gross.

1024
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,538

1031

00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,143

in those shoes?

Okay, fine. I can't.

of each other.

You know how I always
tell that story

00:56:43,192 --> 00:56:45,818
about how I got inspired
to go into politics

1068
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,029
because my dad took me
to the Senate Gallery

1069
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,656
and we sat together
and that's true.

1070
00:56:51,158 --> 00:56:53,076
But what I leave out is

1071
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,161
he did that right
after they died.

1072

And I was bottoming out.

1073

So, he wanted
to get me out of here
for a little while

1074
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:05,296
and he planned
this road trip to DC,

1075
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,507
and I think it's because
JFK was his idol.

And we went and
sat in the gallery.

00:59:52,381 --> 00:59:53,422
Right.

1106
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:56,175
You know,
we broke up
a while ago,

1107
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,679
and it's over and
then he calls four
times in one morning.

1108
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,392
He called you four
times this morning?

1109
01:00:04,476 --> 01:00:05,601
Mmm-hmm.

1110
01:00:07,688 --> 01:00:09,689
How long have you guys
been broken up?

1111
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:11,023
Um...

1112
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,817
Three months.

1113
01:00:13,777 --> 01:00:15,945
It's like he knew
I was with someone else.

1114
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:20,950
Was it serious?

1115
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,868
We were engaged.

1116
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,289
So, not really
that serious?

1117
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:27,707
(LAUGHS) Right.

1118
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,376
Well, what happened?

1119
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,044
(EXHALES HEAVILY)

1120
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,462
Do you want to know this?

1121
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:34,672
Yeah.

1122
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:40,720
He was a great guy.

1123
01:00:40,804 --> 01:00:43,556
Brilliant choreographer
and dancer,

1124
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:47,893
and we had the same
group of friends.

1125
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,062
We had known each
other a long time.

1126
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:55,484
Well, he sounds great.
Why didn't you marry him?

1127
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,908
Because of you.

1128
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,496
I'm not some
hopeless romantic.

1129
01:01:07,581 --> 01:01:09,874
I've never allowed myself
to be that way.

1130
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:13,294
But once I felt,

1131
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:17,089
even for a moment,
what I felt with you.

1132
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:23,429
You ruined me.
I didn't want
to settle for less.

1133
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,349
I know the feeling.

1134
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,976
It scares the
shit out of me.

1135
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,103
I'm not going
to hurt you.

1136
01:01:32,773 --> 01:01:34,023
You don't need to say that.

1137
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,192
I'm not going
to hurt you.

1138
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,573
This is the first time

1139
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,743
in 25 years that I don't
feel like I'm by myself.

1140
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,996
(EXHALES) That's a lot of
responsibility for me.

1141
01:01:49,081 --> 01:01:51,999
I don't know if I'm quite
comfortable with that.

1142
01:01:53,502 --> 01:01:55,127
Well, too late.

1143
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:03,969
You know, I'm supposed to go
to an interview right now.

1144
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:10,476
What if I told you
I wasn't ready to let you
out of my sight quite yet?

1145
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:12,728
Sounds good.
You want to go?

1146
01:02:12,813 --> 01:02:14,772
Yeah.
All right.

1147
01:02:14,856 --> 01:02:14,980
Are you handsome

1148
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,650
Are you handsome

1149
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:21,445
or is it that Washington
is so populated by

1150
01:02:21,780 --> 01:02:25,074
I don't want to say,
hideous abnormalities...

1151
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:26,742
DAVID:
This is getting
a little weird.

1152
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:28,035
(STUDIO AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

1153
01:02:28,578 --> 01:02:30,287
David Norris,
everybody.

1154
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:31,872
(CHEERING)

1155
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:38,587
MAN: Excuse me, ma'am.
Yes?

1156
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:40,714
Congressman Norris asked me
to give you a message.

1157
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:41,924
He was just called
into a meeting.

1158
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,342
He says it's urgent.
Okay.

1159
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:45,010
He said he'll call you
as soon as he's out

1160
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:46,429
and he'll see you
at the show tonight.

1161
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:48,597
Okay, thank you.
Thanks.

1162
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,524
This way, Congressman.

1163
01:03:13,707 --> 01:03:15,916
Hello?

1164
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,715
Frustrating, isn't it?

1165
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:25,843
My name is Thompson.

1166
01:03:28,096 --> 01:03:29,972
Whatever happened
to free will?

1167
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,766
We actually tried
free will before.

1168
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,394
After taking you from
hunting and gathering

1169
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,979
to the height
of the Roman Empire,

1170
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:41,734
we stepped back
to see how you would
do on your own.

1171
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:46,071
You gave us the Dark Ages
for five centuries

1172
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:49,825
until finally we decided
we should come back in.

1173
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:53,662
The Chairman thought
that maybe we just needed
to do a better job

1174
01:03:53,747 --> 01:03:55,748
with teaching you
how to ride a bike

1175
01:03:55,916 --> 01:03:57,833
before taking
the training
wheels off again.

1176
01:03:58,585 --> 01:04:00,878
So, we gave you
the Renaissance,

1177
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,422
the Enlightenment,
scientific revolution.

1178
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:05,174
For 600 years
we taught you

1179
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,510
to control your
impulses with reason.

1180
01:04:07,761 --> 01:04:12,181
Then in 1910,
we stepped back again.

1181
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:16,936
Within 50 years,
you had brought us
World War I,

1182
01:04:17,604 --> 01:04:20,981
the Depression,
Fascism, the Holocaust,

1183
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:23,317
and capped it off by
bringing the entire planet

1184
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,777
to the brink of destruction

1185
01:04:24,903 --> 01:04:26,612
in the Cuban missile crisis.

1186
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,490
At that point
a decision was taken
to step back in again

1187
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:33,661
before you did something
that even we couldn't fix.

1188
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:37,831
You don't have
free will, David.

1189
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,335
You have the appearance
of free will.

1190
01:04:42,671 --> 01:04:43,837
You expect me
to believe that?

1191
01:04:43,922 --> 01:04:45,130
I make decisions
every day.

1192
01:04:45,215 --> 01:04:47,550
You have free will over
which toothpaste you use

1193
01:04:47,634 --> 01:04:49,552
or which beverage
to order at lunch.

1194
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:52,846
But humanity just
isn't mature enough

1195
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,765
to control the
important things.

1196
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:57,101
So, you handle
the important things?

1197
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:59,562
The last time I checked,
the world is a pretty
screwed-up place.

1198
01:04:59,688 --> 01:05:01,981
It's still here.

1199
01:05:02,065 --> 01:05:04,650
If we had left things
in your hands,
it wouldn't be.

1200
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,569
Tell me why
I can't be with Elise?

1201
01:05:07,696 --> 01:05:09,154
Because the last
guy didn't know.

1202
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:12,908
Meeting Elise
at the Waldorf three
years ago wasn't chance.

1203
01:05:12,993 --> 01:05:14,451
That was us.

1204
01:05:14,536 --> 01:05:17,413
We knew she
would inspire you
to give that speech.

1205
01:05:17,539 --> 01:05:20,749
That speech that
brought you back from
the edge of oblivion

1206
01:05:20,834 --> 01:05:24,628
and overnight made
you the frontrunner
in this coming election.

1207
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:26,714
What are you saying?
You want me to
win the election?

1208
01:05:26,798 --> 01:05:30,050
This one and
four more after it.

1209
01:05:30,844 --> 01:05:34,305
And I'm not just
talking about
elections for Senate.

1210
01:05:35,390 --> 01:05:38,350
You can matter, David.
Really matter.

1211
01:05:39,019 --> 01:05:41,812
What your father wanted
when he took you
to the Senate Gallery

1212
01:05:41,896 --> 01:05:43,856
when you were 10.

1213
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:46,025
What your brother wanted
when he made you promise

1214
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:47,860
the day before he overdosed

1215
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,987
that you wouldn't
be like him.

1216
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:54,742
Why do you think
you have that yearning
to be in front of people?

1217
01:05:56,453 --> 01:05:59,330
That terrible emptiness
when you're not.

1218
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:00,831
Don't do that.

1219
01:06:00,915 --> 01:06:03,459
David, you can
change the world,

1220
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:06,837
but that doesn't happen
if you stay with her.

1221
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,131
Why do you people
care who I love?

1222
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,176
It's not about her,
it's about you.

1223
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:14,970
What being with her
does to you.

1224
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,472
What it does to me?

1225
01:06:16,556 --> 01:06:17,765
I'm better when
I'm with her!

1226
01:06:17,849 --> 01:06:19,558
Even you said it.
The speech.

1227
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:22,811
In small doses,
Elise was the cure.

1228
01:06:22,896 --> 01:06:24,521
But in large doses,

1229
01:06:24,606 --> 01:06:25,939
she rubs off on you.

1230
01:06:26,024 --> 01:06:26,982
Stop.

1231
01:06:27,067 --> 01:06:31,028
David, the president
can't be a loose cannon.

1232
01:06:31,112 --> 01:06:32,529
Stop talking.
It's not working.

1233
01:06:32,614 --> 01:06:36,533
Why do you refuse
to accept what should be
completely obvious by now?

1234
01:06:36,618 --> 01:06:38,827
You've seen
what we can do.

1235
01:06:38,912 --> 01:06:41,705
You can't doubt we are
who we say we are.

1236
01:06:44,876 --> 01:06:49,588
Look, it's not
about who you are,
it's about who I am.

1237
01:06:50,674 --> 01:06:52,508
Can't outrun
your fate, David.

1238
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:56,011
I just disagree with you
about what my fate is.

1239
01:06:56,930 --> 01:07:00,933
I know what I feel
for her and it's not
going to change.

1240
01:07:02,143 --> 01:07:05,896
All I have are
the choices that I make.

1241
01:07:06,773 --> 01:07:08,107
And I choose her

1242
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:10,734
come what may.

1243
01:07:15,782 --> 01:07:17,866
It's 6:20.

1244
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:21,453
If you leave now,
you can make Elise's show.

1245
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:23,414

(TRIBAL MUSIC PLAYING)

01:07:52,694 --> 01:07:54,319
(SLOW MUSIC PLAYING)

1249
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,860
She's a beautiful dancer.

1250
01:08:36,321 --> 01:08:38,405
I thought I made
myself clear.

1251
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,825
There is one
more piece to this
I haven't mentioned.

1252
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:46,038
I guess I just didn't
have the heart.

1253
01:08:50,043 --> 01:08:51,794
If you stay with her,

1254
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:54,880
it not only kills your
dreams, it kills hers.

1255
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,383
What?

1256
01:08:59,511 --> 01:09:03,096
Elise is about to become
one of the most famous
dancers in the country

1257
01:09:03,181 --> 01:09:05,891
and eventually
one of the world's

If she stays with you,

she ends up teaching
dance to six-year-olds.

When you look back
at all this, David,

1261
01:09:29,791 --> 01:09:31,583
just remember

1262
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:35,379
we tried
to reason with you.

1266
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,202
I always hear
people saying,

1267
01:10:50,163 --> 01:10:54,333
"You can't blame yourself
for what happens
to other people,"

1268
01:10:54,459 --> 01:10:57,753
but in this case,
really, you can.

1269
01:11:06,554 --> 01:11:08,430
This is what
you do, David.

1270
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,974
This is what you did
getting into a bar fight

It doesn't take
a genius to see Elise

1276
01:11:27,075 --> 01:11:30,661
isn't exactly
helping you with this.

1277
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:34,122
It's a sprain, David,

1278
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,707
but if you stay with her,

1279
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,418
you'll take away the only
thing she ever cared about.

1280
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:39,711
It's up to you.

1281

It's just a sprain.

Yeah.

it's going to be better

I know.

You can't let it
get to you

with his family.

We only see part of it.

I was talking to some friends
of ours over in Monroe
County this morning,

1307
01:14:25,044 --> 01:14:27,087
and I said something
to them that I think

1308
01:14:27,171 --> 01:14:30,215
a lot of you may have
heard me say before
but it bears repeating.

1309
01:14:30,383 --> 01:14:34,261
David Norris, who has spent
the last two days campaigning
in the Tri-Lakes area

1310
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:37,931
received some welcome
news yesterday when the
latest New York Times poll

1311
01:14:38,015 --> 01:14:40,392
gave him a 16-point
lead over his opponent

1312
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,727
less than a month
before election day.

1313

Since his announcement
11 months ago,

1314
01:14:45,314 --> 01:14:47,524
Norris has had
a significant lead...

1315
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:50,193
Hi. Thanks.
Thanks a lot.

1316
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:52,279
Yeah, thank you.
I need it. Thank you.

Hey.

1325
01:15:11,924 --> 01:15:14,593
I want to show you this,
because you would
find out eventually.

1326
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:16,428
I want to be here
when you do.

1327
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:24,311
She's getting married
to that guy she was
engaged to.

1328
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,732
You okay?

1329
01:15:29,609 --> 01:15:31,109
I think I'm going to...

1330
01:15:31,444 --> 01:15:32,903
Take a day off.

1331
01:15:32,987 --> 01:15:35,614
Hell, take a couple.
We're 16 points up.

1332
01:15:36,532 --> 01:15:38,450

blow a lead that big.

good to see you again.

1334
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,773
Your friend
just left you this.

1335
01:16:51,857 --> 01:16:53,358
He said you would
be stopping by.

1336
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:16,715
Why would you
want to see me?

1337
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,219
Thompson was
lying when he said

1338
01:17:21,304 --> 01:17:24,097
you couldn't be with Elise
because she brings out
your reckless side.

1339
01:17:24,682 --> 01:17:27,559
Then why? Why do
they care so much?

1340
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,854
Because she's enough, David.

1341
01:17:31,605 --> 01:17:32,731
If you have her,

1342
01:17:32,815 --> 01:17:34,899
you won't need to fill
that void inside of you

1343
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,527
with applause and votes

1344
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:40,030
and dreams of one day
making it to the White House.

1345
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,950
That's important,
but it's not the only
thing that matters.

1346
01:17:45,828 --> 01:17:47,495
Why are you so
different from them?

1347
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,548
Your dad

1348
01:17:59,759 --> 01:18:02,260
was a very smart man.

1349
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,640
He could have
been a lot more.
Wanted to be.

1350
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:11,186
Your brother, too.

1351
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,938
But the plan
didn't call for it.

1352
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,524
What about my mother?

1353
01:18:16,609 --> 01:18:17,942
That wasn't me.

1354
01:18:18,486 --> 01:18:20,403
That wasn't us at all.

1355
01:18:20,905 --> 01:18:22,572
It was just chance?

1356
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:27,660
I'm sorry.

1357
01:18:31,582 --> 01:18:33,875
You know,
Thompson is not lying.

1358
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:38,296
They're already
talking about me being
a presidential candidate.

1359
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:41,508
I'm phoning in my speeches
and I'm 16 points up.

1360
01:18:41,592 --> 01:18:43,468
The public loves you.

1361
01:18:43,803 --> 01:18:46,596
Before I met Elise,
that's all I cared about.

1362
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,642
I don't even notice it now.

1363
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:58,483
I can't stop
thinking about her.

1364
01:19:05,991 --> 01:19:07,867
Do you know where
she's getting married?

1365
01:19:10,037 --> 01:19:12,997
In front of a judge
tomorrow morning.

1366
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,166
Is she happy?

1367
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:20,547
Thompson won't let you
anywhere near her.

1368
01:19:20,631 --> 01:19:23,091
Not tonight,
not tomorrow, not ever.

1369
01:19:23,175 --> 01:19:24,884
Harry.

1370
01:19:25,970 --> 01:19:27,011
Is she happy?

1371
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:29,013
(SIGHS)

1372
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:32,684
I got to try
and get her back.

1373
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:37,021
Will you help me?
Will you just help
me get to her?

1374
01:19:37,106 --> 01:19:39,274
They'll sense you
coming a mile away.

1375
01:19:40,109 --> 01:19:42,235
What if I could move
as fast as you?

1376
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:45,989
Teach me about the doors.

1377
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:47,574
HARRY:
The rain will stop
in the next hour,

1378
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:49,492
HARRY:
The rain will stop
in the next hour,

1379
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:52,287
and that's the only thing
keeping them from
seeing us right now.

1380
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,081
If we're going to do this,
we'll need all
night to do it

1381
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:57,876
and a place surrounded
by water to do it in.

1382
01:19:59,044 --> 01:20:01,671
Always turn the
doorknob clockwise.

1383
01:20:02,214 --> 01:20:03,965
What happens
if I turn it
the other way?

1384
01:20:04,049 --> 01:20:06,843
You don't want to do that.
That's only for us.

1385
01:20:08,304 --> 01:20:09,762
Put your hand
on my shoulder

1386
01:20:09,847 --> 01:20:12,182
and don't let go
until we cross
the threshold.

1387
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:13,808
Are these ever locked?

1388
01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:16,478
Not when
you're wearing
one of our hats.

1389
01:20:20,900 --> 01:20:21,941
Keep moving, David.

1390
01:20:27,948 --> 01:20:29,365
Is this...

1391
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,075
It's the Museum
of Modern Art.

1392
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:32,327
Yeah.

1393
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:44,923
Close the door.

1394
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:55,183
This is the city's
main pumping station
for downtown Manhattan.

1395
01:20:56,101 --> 01:20:58,269
We're 10 blocks
from the courthouse.

1396
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,026
Wait here.

1397
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:26,839
Hi, is the floor open?

1398
01:21:26,924 --> 01:21:28,007
You okay, sweetie?

1399
01:21:28,092 --> 01:21:30,093
Yeah, I just...

1400
01:21:31,053 --> 01:21:34,305
I just feel like
being on the floor.

1401
01:21:41,438 --> 01:21:44,357
Lower Manhattan
is layer upon layer
of substrate.

1402
01:21:44,441 --> 01:21:47,360
That's what we call
the doors that have
been added over time.

1403
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:51,823
Makes it a lot more
complex to navigate
downtown than it is uptown

1404
01:21:51,907 --> 01:21:53,324
and a lot slower.

1405
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:58,413
Your destination,
60 Centre Street,
Courtroom 300.

1406
01:22:03,419 --> 01:22:04,752
There are thousands
of different ways

1407
01:22:04,837 --> 01:22:07,130
to get to the courthouse
using the doors.

1408
01:22:07,298 --> 01:22:09,549
I want you
to learn how to stay
in the substrate

1409
01:22:09,633 --> 01:22:12,135
so Thompson won't be able
to get a fix on you.

1410
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:15,305
DAVID:
Okay. Just south of
the diner, it's a red door.

1411
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,807
I come out on Broadway,
right by Leonard Street.

1412
01:22:17,891 --> 01:22:19,726
That's good.
Keep going.

1413
01:22:19,935 --> 01:22:22,186
From Leonard,
half a block down.

1414
01:22:22,271 --> 01:22:23,896
Okay, suppose
Thompson's there?

1415
01:22:23,981 --> 01:22:26,357
Okay, I go east
to Lafayette.

1416
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:28,192
No, it's Crosby
Street there.

1417
01:22:28,319 --> 01:22:30,278
Eight doors?
I'm zigzagging
all over the place.

1418
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:31,446
That will take me
too long.

1419
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:32,947
But every time you
go through a door,

1420
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:35,742
their plan books
will lose track of you,
so it's safer.

1421
01:22:36,118 --> 01:22:39,245
HARRY: Look, I need you
to understand this has
never been done before.

1422
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:42,790
So, the minute you go
through that first door,
all hell will break loose.

1423
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:45,710
Assume everyone with
a hat on is a threat.

1424
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:47,170
I don't care if
it's a Yankee cap,

1425
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,047
a bowler, or
even a yarmulke.

1426
01:22:49,131 --> 01:22:51,924
Assume everyone in a hat
is working with Thompson.

1427
01:22:52,051 --> 01:22:54,761
Even you guys can't
get through the doors
without your hats on, right?

1428
01:22:54,845 --> 01:22:55,970
Right.

1429
01:22:56,055 --> 01:22:58,431
It's one of the
ways the Chairman
limits our power.

1430
01:22:58,515 --> 01:22:59,682
Water is another way.

1431
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:02,268
And you said before,
what if Thompson's in front
of me on Crosby Street?

1432
01:23:02,353 --> 01:23:03,394
Right.

1433
01:23:03,479 --> 01:23:05,355
Why don't I just knock
the hat off his head

1434
01:23:05,439 --> 01:23:07,815
and then run by him
before he has time
to pick it up?

1435
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:10,318
That's good, improvisation.
We have trouble with that.

1436
01:23:10,819 --> 01:23:13,404
DAVID: The fastest way
is actually if I go right
for the blue door.

1437
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,490
Yeah, but then
you're exposed the
entire way there.

1438
01:23:15,574 --> 01:23:17,742
That's a lot more
dangerous than
leapfrogging through doors.

1439
01:23:17,826 --> 01:23:19,827
But if I make it,
I'll take them
completely by surprise.

1440
01:23:19,912 --> 01:23:20,953
If you make it.

1441
01:23:26,293 --> 01:23:28,961
Come on, we have
a lot more to get through.

1442
01:23:29,046 --> 01:23:30,922
Whatever it takes.

1443
01:23:33,467 --> 01:23:36,219
Your father used
to say that.

1444
01:23:43,310 --> 01:23:46,187
I guess you're not
supposed to identify
with your subjects.

1445
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:47,772
You're not supposed
to feel guilt.

1446
01:23:48,565 --> 01:23:51,651
We're not built to lead
with our emotions
like you are,

1447
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:55,196
but that doesn't mean
we don't have them.

1448
01:23:56,949 --> 01:23:58,408
Some more than others.

1449
01:24:16,552 --> 01:24:18,302
(RAIN PATTERING)

1450
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,474
You're lucky,
it started raining again.

1451
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:25,518
We need to get going.
The wedding is in 10 minutes.

1452
01:24:25,602 --> 01:24:28,855
We have time.
Being early is just
as bad as being late.

1453
01:24:32,317 --> 01:24:33,443
Is your fiancée here?

1454
01:24:33,527 --> 01:24:35,236
She's on her way in.

1455
01:24:36,196 --> 01:24:38,322
Courtroom 300.

1456
01:24:42,327 --> 01:24:44,328
You okay?
Yeah.

1457
01:24:49,209 --> 01:24:50,835
This is it.
Okay.

1458
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:54,922
I'm going to go
for the blue door.

1459
01:24:55,007 --> 01:24:56,174
Of course.

1460
01:24:58,302 --> 01:25:01,095
Here is your
way through it.
Don't lose it.

1461
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,390
Thanks, Harry.

1462
01:25:04,475 --> 01:25:06,184
Good luck.

1463
01:25:11,648 --> 01:25:13,274
Okay.

1464
01:25:31,210 --> 01:25:34,378
It looks like Mr. Norris
is using the rain
to make a run for it.

1465
01:25:34,463 --> 01:25:36,839
Call the proctor
at the wedding.

1466
01:25:38,884 --> 01:25:41,385
What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm just
nervous, I guess.

1467
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:44,388
I just need a minute
in the bathroom, okay?

1468
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:08,162
Sir, he's got a hat.
He's in the substrate.

1469
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:09,956
He just went into
the substrate.

1470
01:26:28,016 --> 01:26:29,350
Whoa, whoa.
No, no, no.

1471
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,352
It's an emergency. Sorry.

1472
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:34,188
Docket number 22,
please come forward.

1473
01:26:34,273 --> 01:26:35,731
We're next.
Will you go
check on her?

1474
01:26:35,816 --> 01:26:37,149
Yeah.

1475
01:26:44,241 --> 01:26:45,741
You're David Norris!
Yeah, I got to go.

1476
01:26:50,038 --> 01:26:51,122
Nothing in the hat.

1477
01:26:51,206 --> 01:26:52,290
SECURITY OFFICER:
Go ahead.

1478
01:27:08,015 --> 01:27:09,640
She's not even
in there.

1479
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:13,311
Where is she?
Where is she?

1480
01:27:15,147 --> 01:27:16,731
Elise.

1481
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:20,234
You're not
marrying that guy.

1482
01:27:20,319 --> 01:27:21,694
(PANTING)

1483
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,113
I'm so sorry,

1484
01:27:24,197 --> 01:27:27,408
and I don't know what
you must think of me,
but you can't marry him.

1485
01:27:27,576 --> 01:27:29,702
You don't love him.
I've been terrible, I know.

1486
01:27:29,786 --> 01:27:31,746
I'm getting married.
No, you can't.

1487
01:27:31,830 --> 01:27:34,081
Don't touch me!
What are you doing?

1488
01:27:34,166 --> 01:27:36,792
Do you know that
no one has ever hurt me
as much as you did?

1489
01:27:36,877 --> 01:27:38,586
I'm so sorry that
I left you the way
that I did.

1490
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:41,339
David, you know what?
You left me in
a fucking hospital.

1491
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:42,506
What are you doing?

1492
01:27:42,591 --> 01:27:44,675
I know it seems terrible
but there was a reason.

1493
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,385
You don't know
anything about me

1494
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,637
and what makes me happy.

1495
01:27:47,721 --> 01:27:49,513
I'm sorry that I hurt you.

1496
01:27:51,642 --> 01:27:52,683
Oh, my God.

1497
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,644
Don't worry about him,
he's with them.

1498
01:27:54,728 --> 01:27:56,604
Just listen to me.
Oh, my God, what did you do?

1499
01:27:56,772 --> 01:27:58,522
Forget about him.
What are you doing?

1500
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:02,610
Look at me, I know
that you love me.

1501
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:09,617
Okay, this says
that you love me

1502
01:28:09,743 --> 01:28:12,203
and that I love you
and that we're not
supposed to be together.

1503
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:13,454
Because of this book.

1504
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:15,247
But I know that
I'm supposed
to be with you

1505
01:28:15,332 --> 01:28:16,499
because of the way I feel.

1506
01:28:16,583 --> 01:28:18,376
I love you and I don't
care what happens.

1507
01:28:18,460 --> 01:28:21,504
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you even
if it's only a little while.

1508
01:28:23,131 --> 01:28:25,091
He just revealed us.

1509
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:26,801
Call the Intervention Team.

1510
01:28:26,885 --> 01:28:29,303
Tell them it's
a square-one reset.

1511
01:28:35,394 --> 01:28:38,312
Mr. Thompson has deployed
the Intervention Team.

1512
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:40,690
He's requesting
an emergency
Reset Authorization.

1513
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,233
I'll carry it in.

1514
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:49,615
(PANTING)

1515
01:28:50,617 --> 01:28:52,243
Why are they chasing you?

1516
01:28:54,621 --> 01:28:56,330
They're going to reset me.

1517
01:28:56,415 --> 01:28:57,915
What are you
talking about?

1518
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,584
I never lied to you.

1519
01:29:00,669 --> 01:29:02,169
MAN: Down here.

1520
01:29:02,587 --> 01:29:04,672
He's down here.

1521
01:29:04,756 --> 01:29:06,632
I love you, Elise.

1522
01:29:08,552 --> 01:29:10,511
I'm going to show
you something.

1523
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,638
You deserve to know.

1524
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,473
What's going on?

1525
01:29:23,608 --> 01:29:26,444
We got to keep moving.
There is another door here.

1526
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,642
Got them.
Sixth Avenue.

1527
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:00,478
Contain this.

1528
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,857
Oh, my God.
What's happening to me?

1529
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,068
All you need to know,
we're being chased.

1530
01:30:07,152 --> 01:30:09,361
I need you to trust me.

1531
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:10,488
I need you to trust me.

1532
01:30:10,989 --> 01:30:12,698
Okay.
Okay, come on.

1533
01:30:23,794 --> 01:30:25,503
Door, door, door!

1534
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:29,507
Find another door!

1535
01:30:29,591 --> 01:30:30,925
(GASPS)

1536
01:30:34,012 --> 01:30:35,930
What the hell is going on?

1537
01:30:36,014 --> 01:30:37,681
What the hell is
going on, David?

1538
01:30:37,766 --> 01:30:38,808
Okay, I'm sorry.

1539
01:30:38,892 --> 01:30:40,101
How did we
just do that?

1540
01:30:40,185 --> 01:30:41,644
I'm so sorry.

1541
01:30:41,728 --> 01:30:44,063
These doors belong
to the people
who are chasing us.

1542
01:30:44,189 --> 01:30:46,232
Who are they?
I don't know
what to call them,

1543
01:30:46,316 --> 01:30:47,900
but they want to take
you away from me.

1544
01:30:47,984 --> 01:30:49,693
Why do they
care about us?

1545
01:30:49,778 --> 01:30:51,320
They hurt your ankle,
Elise.

1546
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:53,197
Everything you've worked
for your entire life,

1547
01:30:53,281 --> 01:30:55,116
it doesn't happen
if you stay with me.

1548
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:56,826
That's why I left you
in the hospital.

1549
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:58,410
I don't understand.

1550
01:30:59,621 --> 01:31:01,539
I don't understand.

1551
01:31:02,582 --> 01:31:03,999
This can't be wrong.

1552
01:31:05,877 --> 01:31:08,003
This can't be wrong.

1553
01:31:09,548 --> 01:31:11,882
Why do they
think it's wrong?

1554
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:14,301
The book... Their book.

1555
01:31:15,011 --> 01:31:16,887
But what if I can
find who wrote it?

1556
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:26,939
Okay, I can go
through this door alone.

1557
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,441
You'll never see me
or the people
chasing us again.

1558
01:31:32,404 --> 01:31:36,407
Or you could come with me,
and I don't know what's
on the other side,

1559
01:31:37,159 --> 01:31:38,450
but I know you
would be next to me,

1560
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:40,494
and that's all I've wanted
since the minute I met you.

1561
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:54,008
I'm coming with you.

1562
01:31:57,971 --> 01:31:59,513
Okay.

1563
01:32:02,434 --> 01:32:03,434
Take the other one.

1564
01:32:04,394 --> 01:32:05,978
Turn it to the left.

1565
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:07,563
To the left.

1566
01:32:16,823 --> 01:32:17,948
Oh, my God.

1567
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,543
(SIGHS)

1568
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,303
MAN: Hey!
You can't be in here.

1569
01:32:39,387 --> 01:32:40,846
MAN 2: Stop, sir!

1570
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:42,848
MAN 3: Hold them up!

1571
01:32:45,018 --> 01:32:46,143
Come on.

1572
01:32:48,480 --> 01:32:49,813
MAN 4: Stop them!

1573
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:18,008
Harry Mitchell,
they want you in
the Chairman's office.

1574
01:33:18,093 --> 01:33:19,635
Immediately.

1575
01:33:39,698 --> 01:33:40,948
Come on.

1576
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:55,629
Hey! Hey!

1577
01:33:56,006 --> 01:33:57,840
How did you get in here?

1578
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:17,151
Search the room!

1579
01:34:34,711 --> 01:34:35,919
Shit!

1580
01:34:36,921 --> 01:34:38,130
Go back.

1581
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:04,448
No.

1582
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:06,742
Oh, my God.

1583
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,542
I love you.
I love you.

1584
01:36:01,506 --> 01:36:03,924
Did you really think
you could reach
the Chairman?

1585
01:36:04,676 --> 01:36:06,468
And change your
fate if you did?

1586
01:36:06,553 --> 01:36:08,679
Or write your own?

1587
01:36:09,013 --> 01:36:11,974
It doesn't work like that
and I told you why.

1588
01:36:14,686 --> 01:36:17,229
I've got a message for you.

1589
01:36:26,698 --> 01:36:28,157
I understand.

1590
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:40,043
Even Thompson has a boss.

1591
01:36:40,670 --> 01:36:41,837
Harry?

1592
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:45,799
You're the Chairman?

1593
01:36:45,884 --> 01:36:47,301
(LAUGHS) No.

1594
01:36:48,011 --> 01:36:50,554
You've met him
though, or her.

1595
01:36:50,638 --> 01:36:52,139
Everybody has.

1596
01:36:53,016 --> 01:36:55,434
The Chairman comes
in a different form
to everyone

1597
01:36:55,518 --> 01:36:58,061
so people rarely realize
when it happens.

1598
01:37:01,232 --> 01:37:04,485
Is this some
sort of test?

1599
01:37:04,569 --> 01:37:06,737
In a way, it's all a test,

1600
01:37:07,614 --> 01:37:11,074
for everybody,
even the members
of the Adjustment Bureau.

1601
01:37:12,410 --> 01:37:15,078
David, you risked
everything for Elise.

1602
01:37:15,663 --> 01:37:18,540
And Elise, when you
came through that door
at the Statue of Liberty,

1603
01:37:18,625 --> 01:37:20,167
you risked everything, too.

1604
01:37:21,211 --> 01:37:22,711
But you inspired me.

1605
01:37:23,296 --> 01:37:25,589
It seems like
you inspired the
Chairman, too.

1606
01:37:28,843 --> 01:37:30,177
Is that about us?

1607
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:31,720
Yes.

1608
01:37:33,515 --> 01:37:34,681
What does it say?

1609
01:37:34,766 --> 01:37:37,017
It says that this situation
between the two of you

1610
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:39,686
is a serious deviation
from the plan.

1611
01:37:43,107 --> 01:37:45,275
So, the Chairman
rewrote it.

1612
01:37:53,493 --> 01:37:54,618
Okay.

1613
01:37:55,787 --> 01:37:57,454
Now what?

1614
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,872
Now...

1615
01:38:02,585 --> 01:38:04,169
You can take the stairs.

1616
01:38:17,976 --> 01:38:20,477
HARRY: Most people live life
on the path we set for them.

1617
01:38:21,604 --> 01:38:23,272
Too afraid
to explore any other.

1618
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:27,526
But once in a while,
people like you come along

1619
01:38:27,610 --> 01:38:31,280
who knock down
all the obstacles
we put in your way.

1620
01:38:31,781 --> 01:38:35,576
People who realize
free will is a gift you'll
never know how to use

1621
01:38:35,660 --> 01:38:37,536
until you fight for it.

1622
01:38:38,496 --> 01:38:41,123
I think that's the
Chairman's real plan

1623
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:42,874
that maybe one day

1624
01:38:44,168 --> 01:38:46,336
we won't write the plan.

1625
01:38:47,171 --> 01:38:48,589
You will.
