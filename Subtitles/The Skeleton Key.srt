<i>"I lost no time, of course, in
telling my mother all that I knew...</i>

3
00:00:27,332 --> 00:00:31,378
<i>"and we saw ourselves at once in
a difficult and dangerous position.</i>

4
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:34,798
<i>"Something must speedily be resolved
upon, and it occurred to us...</i>

5
00:00:34,923 --> 00:00:36,425
"at last to go forth together...

6
00:00:36,508 --> 00:00:38,886
"and seek help
in the neighboring hamlet.

7
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:42,514
"No sooner said than done.
Bare-headed as we were...

8
00:00:42,765 --> 00:00:46,643
"we ran out at once in the gathering
evening and the frosty fog.

9
00:00:46,935 --> 00:00:49,438
"The hamlet lay not many
hundred yards away...

10
00:00:49,605 --> 00:00:52,566
<i>"though out of view, on the other
side of the next cove...</i>

11
00:00:52,691 --> 00:00:54,359

12
00:00:54,526 --> 00:00:56,111

"from that whence the blind man
had made his appearance.

"And I shall never forget
how much I was cheered...

15
00:01:01,784 --> 00:01:04,703
"to see the yellow shine in doors
and windows...

<i>"but that, as it proved...</i>

17
00:01:05,954 --> 00:01:09,374
<i>"was the best of the help we were
likely to get in that quarter.</i>

00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:10,793
<i>"For you would have thought...</i>

19
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:12,753

21
00:01:37,736 --> 00:01:39,279
Audrey? Sorry.

22
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:43,325
Mr. Talcott's gone.

23
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,869
Okay.

24
00:02:01,677 --> 00:02:04,096
Front desk, in case anyone shows.

25
00:02:12,855 --> 00:02:15,399
I think you'll be waiting
a while, hon.

26
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:18,318
No. Didn't we call? He said he had family.

27
00:02:18,444 --> 00:02:19,403
Yeah.

28
00:02:19,528 --> 00:02:22,698
But they don't want to have anything
to do with him.

29
00:02:22,865 --> 00:02:25,117
You can dump it out back.

30
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:39,608
Okay, take a look.

31
00:03:42,111 --> 00:03:43,904
I interview tomorrow.

32
00:03:44,029 --> 00:03:45,072
What about your job?

33
00:03:45,197 --> 00:03:46,615
I had enough of that place.

34
00:03:46,698 --> 00:03:49,451
- What happened?
- Here's your beer.

35
00:03:49,535 --> 00:03:50,911
- Thanks.
- Sure.

36
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,540
I lost a patient today. Mr. Talcott.

37
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,792
- I'm sorry.
- You should have seen it.

38
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,377
The second he died, it was like...

39
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,087
they couldn't wait to get him out of there.

40
00:04:00,212 --> 00:04:01,422
It's just a business to them.

41
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:03,215
It is a business, but at least he had you.

42
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:05,717
No. It's supposed to be
a business about caring.

43
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,511
They couldn't care less.

44
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:12,015
Wait. This is Terrebonne Parish.
It's the freaking swamps.

45
00:04:13,058 --> 00:04:16,603
I get the hours I need to start
nursing school, and I get paid.

46
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:19,815
And I get to help somebody, my way.

47
00:04:19,982 --> 00:04:23,402
They got gators in the swamps,
and guys missing teeth.

48
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:25,904
Are we dancing here, or what?

49
00:04:27,072 --> 00:04:28,449
Cary, look.

50
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:31,452
This work you're doing,
are you sure it's not changing you?

51
00:04:31,577 --> 00:04:34,538
I'm 25 years old.
What's wrong with a little change?

52
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:08,465
Oh, my God.

53
00:06:41,206 --> 00:06:42,332
Hello?

54
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:48,505
Hello?

55
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:47,398
Now that right there
is what love is all about.

56
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:50,401
Old-fashioned devotion,
like what you read about.

57
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,361
You must be Caroline.

58
00:07:52,444 --> 00:07:55,155
I'm sorry, the door was open,
so I just walked in.

59
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,950
Oh, no. It's a big house. I didn't hear you.

60
00:07:59,451 --> 00:08:00,828
It's okay.

61
00:08:02,454 --> 00:08:04,998
So much for getting their affairs in order.

62
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,545
I'm sorry. I'm Luke Marshall. Estate lawyer.

63
00:08:09,962 --> 00:08:11,463
We talked on the phone.

64
00:08:11,547 --> 00:08:12,881
Oh, right.

65
00:08:14,216 --> 00:08:17,386
The docs figure a month maybe.
He's pretty far gone.

66
00:08:17,553 --> 00:08:18,595
I understand.

67
00:08:18,721 --> 00:08:21,849
His wife's having kind of
a rough time with it.

68
00:08:22,391 --> 00:08:23,809
Most people do.

69
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:30,023
Violet, you have a visitor.

70
00:08:33,235 --> 00:08:35,028
May I present Miss Caroline Ellis?

71
00:08:35,154 --> 00:08:36,864
She works down at the hospice
in New Orleans.

72
00:08:36,989 --> 00:08:39,158
Caroline, this is Violet Devereaux.

73
00:08:40,576 --> 00:08:42,453
You have a lovely home.

74
00:08:49,501 --> 00:08:52,129
I'm sorry. It's just hard.
The idea of a stranger living here--

75
00:08:52,254 --> 00:08:53,589
I understand, really.

76
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:57,009
She's Old South, you know.
She thinks women still curtsey.

77
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:02,181
So, he can't talk at all?

78
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:04,933
No. Stroke pretty much paralyzed him.

79
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,352
- Which side was affected?
- Both.

80
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:11,065
It happened about a month ago,
up in the attic.

81
00:09:11,273 --> 00:09:13,317
That's where she found him.

82
00:09:13,442 --> 00:09:14,526
Ben?

83
00:09:15,944 --> 00:09:18,947
You have a visitor. Meet Miss Caroline Ellis.

84
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,825
Hello, Ben. I'm Caroline.

85
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:27,372
She's not from around here.
She not going to understand my house.

86
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:28,624
She's from New Orleans.

87
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:31,960
She wasn't raised in New Orleans.
You hear how she talks?

88
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:36,131
- Who knows where she comes from?
- Hoboken, New Jersey.

89
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,592
What do you want a Southern accent?

90
00:09:38,717 --> 00:09:40,761
The last one left, Violet.

91
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:42,638
All right.

92
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:46,809
But she's not going to understand the house.

93
00:09:47,726 --> 00:09:49,186
The last girl left, huh?

94
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,814
Wait. Let me talk to her,
we can straighten things out.

95
00:09:51,897 --> 00:09:53,941
I can't help anybody
who doesn't want my help.

96
00:09:54,066 --> 00:09:56,193
She does want help. She's just scared.

97
00:09:56,318 --> 00:09:57,903
Of what? Politeness?

98
00:09:58,028 --> 00:10:00,197
No. He's the love of her life and he's dying.

99
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,824
They've been together forever.

100
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:03,617
She's losing her soul mate here.

101
00:10:03,742 --> 00:10:06,286
I don't know about you, but that'd
put some sandpaper up my ass.

102
00:10:06,412 --> 00:10:08,288
Aren't you a romantic?

103
00:10:10,332 --> 00:10:11,417
Look.

104
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:12,876
The last girl quit.

105
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:15,170
You're the fifth interview since.
She shoots down everyone.

106
00:10:16,755 --> 00:10:18,340
It's not personal.

107
00:10:18,424 --> 00:10:21,051
But you being here means he's really dying.

108
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,223
He's dying whether I'm here or not.

109
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:29,518
What'd she mean about the house?

110
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:31,103
What?

111
00:10:31,186 --> 00:10:35,023
She said I wouldn't understand
the house. Why'd she said that?

112
00:10:36,024 --> 00:10:38,318
All I know is her cheques clear.

113
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:40,904
Look, forget it.

114
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,325
If it makes you feel any better, I'm
still looking for my dream job, too.

115
00:10:46,118 --> 00:10:47,161
All right.

116
00:10:48,787 --> 00:10:51,540
So if you talked to her, what would you say?

117
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:55,377
I'd say she could look all she wants...

118
00:10:55,502 --> 00:10:58,088
but I doubt she'd find any better than you.

119
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,008
So she'd do well to treat you like it.

120
00:11:02,843 --> 00:11:06,013
Okay, here are my rules. No knitting.

121
00:11:07,139 --> 00:11:09,058
No joining a bridge club.

122
00:11:09,391 --> 00:11:10,976
And no playing bingo.

123
00:11:11,393 --> 00:11:13,437
Okay, good. Good rules.

124
00:11:13,979 --> 00:11:17,107
I'm serious, they'll try and suck
you into their elderly ways.

125
00:11:17,232 --> 00:11:19,485
It's less than an hour away.
I'll be back all the time.

126
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:21,111
Yeah, well, you better.

127
00:11:21,236 --> 00:11:24,364
Whenever you want to talk to someone
who wasn't around for World War II.

128
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,742
Jeez, what is it with you and old people?

129
00:11:26,909 --> 00:11:27,951
Come here.

130
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,330
He'd be proud of you. You know he would.

131
00:11:59,274 --> 00:12:00,442
Hello?

132
00:12:06,698 --> 00:12:08,784
I need to pay for some gas.

133
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:17,000
Hello?

134
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:39,815
Is somebody back there?

135
00:12:56,582 --> 00:12:57,875
I'm sorry.

136
00:12:58,917 --> 00:13:01,712
Excuse me. I just need to pay for some gas.

137
00:13:16,185 --> 00:13:17,519
Jesus.

138
00:13:29,948 --> 00:13:31,700
$17 for the gas.

139
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:36,205
Keep the change.

140
00:14:24,002 --> 00:14:25,546
Mrs. Devereaux?

141
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,340
I'm unpacked.

142
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,283
Hi, Ben. Remember me? I'm Caroline.

143
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:57,369
I'll be taking care of you for a while.

144
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:06,754
There's not a lot of light in here
for you, is there?

145
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:12,885
So you're a fan of the blues, huh?
Well, so was--

146
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,846
You have to let go.

147
00:15:16,472 --> 00:15:18,223
Ben, you're hurting me.

148
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,349
Ouch.

149
00:15:19,475 --> 00:15:20,976
There you are.

150
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,936
Time for his remedies.

151
00:15:23,812 --> 00:15:25,481
Scoot over, child.

152
00:15:26,398 --> 00:15:28,859
9:00 in the morning and 7:00 at night.

153
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:32,321
He takes his pills in powder form.
I'll show you how.

154
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:34,490
Be sure he drinks it all down.

155
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:37,493
- What's he taking?
- Oh, Coumadin and such.

156
00:15:37,576 --> 00:15:41,080
He gets the tremors sometimes.
Don't let that frighten you.

157
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:45,000
And a kiss to make it taste better.

158
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:50,130
You're scrawnier than I'd hoped.
Prettier, though.

159
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:54,093
I bet you're all marked up, aren't you?

160
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,595
- Marked up?
- Written on.

161
00:15:56,929 --> 00:15:58,389
I know you young people are always...

162
00:15:58,514 --> 00:16:01,183
jabbing yourselves with ink and needles.

163
00:16:01,517 --> 00:16:03,310
You're written on, aren't you?

164
00:16:03,435 --> 00:16:05,312
Not where you can see.

165
00:16:05,437 --> 00:16:06,688
Well.

166
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:09,983
He's to be bathed daily, his linens changed.

167
00:16:10,442 --> 00:16:14,196
Don't bother with the housework.
I'm the only one that knows how.

168
00:16:15,697 --> 00:16:18,075
How long have you two lived here?

169
00:16:19,701 --> 00:16:21,036
Let's see.

170
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:24,915
We came over from Savannah in '62.

171
00:16:25,791 --> 00:16:28,752
We bought this house
from a brother and a sister.

172
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:32,172
They'd inherited it a long time ago,
from their parents.

173
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:34,800
Lived here since they were children.

174
00:16:34,883 --> 00:16:37,428
There they are. Martin and Grace.

175
00:16:38,053 --> 00:16:39,763
Charming people.

176
00:16:40,723 --> 00:16:43,976
But they fell on hard times, had to sell.

177
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,270
You keep their picture?

178
00:16:46,395 --> 00:16:50,190
Yes. I like to pay my respects
to the memories of this house.

179
00:17:05,831 --> 00:17:07,583
All right. Come along now.

180
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:16,133
This is the dining room.

181
00:17:16,258 --> 00:17:17,968
We only use about half of the rooms.

182
00:17:18,093 --> 00:17:20,429
The others are for Ben's antique business.

183
00:17:20,512 --> 00:17:23,223
What he couldn't sell, we stored here.

184
00:17:23,348 --> 00:17:25,267
Except for the attic.

185
00:17:25,517 --> 00:17:27,519
That has crystal and china.

186
00:17:27,603 --> 00:17:31,273
And I keep a very close account
on that, just so as you know.

187
00:17:34,526 --> 00:17:37,029
There are more than 30 rooms in all.

188
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,824
In the old days, they made
a separate key for each room.

189
00:17:40,949 --> 00:17:44,078
For the owner, they made a skeleton key.

190
00:17:45,037 --> 00:17:47,081
This will open every door.

191
00:17:47,706 --> 00:17:49,333
This one is yours.

192
00:17:50,709 --> 00:17:52,086
I have mine.

193
00:17:53,587 --> 00:17:55,339
Now, the pantry's right out here.

194
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:59,218
You know, we may have to ask you
to go into town now and then.

195
00:17:59,385 --> 00:18:01,220
Was there a mirror here once?

196
00:18:03,806 --> 00:18:06,475
I noticed in the bathrooms also
there are no mirrors.

197
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:09,645
Child, when you get as worn-out
and wrinkled as we are...

198
00:18:09,728 --> 00:18:11,438
you don't need any reminding.

199
00:18:11,563 --> 00:18:13,690
If you want a small one
for your own purposes...

200
00:18:13,774 --> 00:18:14,858
that's fine with me.

201
00:18:14,942 --> 00:18:17,736
- What'd you do with them?
- Put them away.

202
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:25,953
The boy tells me you don't smoke.

203
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:29,164
I do smoke. I smoke a lot
and I enjoy it very much.

204
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:30,666
I trust that won't be an issue.

205
00:18:30,749 --> 00:18:31,834
It won't be.

206
00:18:31,917 --> 00:18:34,378
Good. Then for the most part
just realize that...

207
00:18:34,503 --> 00:18:36,630
I'll live here as if you're not in residence.

208
00:18:36,755 --> 00:18:40,175
After all, we're not kin.
Are your parents still alive?

209
00:18:41,427 --> 00:18:45,806
My mom left when I was little. My
dad raised me and he died last year.

210
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:49,351
Oh, my. So you cared for him as well?

211
00:18:50,936 --> 00:18:52,438
I would have.

212
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:55,023
I just thought I had more time.

213
00:18:58,235 --> 00:18:59,278
Yeah.

214
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,532
You think too much about the time
you have left...

215
00:19:04,116 --> 00:19:06,118
you don't spend it living.

216
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:09,455
Be good to my husband.
Be good to his house.

217
00:19:10,122 --> 00:19:11,498
Remedies at 9:00.

218
00:19:11,665 --> 00:19:13,667
One, two, three.

219
00:19:33,145 --> 00:19:36,982
You don't see gardens like this
back in New Jersey, I expect.

220
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:40,652
Actually, it's the Garden State.

221
00:19:41,153 --> 00:19:43,280
I doubt that very much.

222
00:19:44,907 --> 00:19:47,451
Nothing more glorious than a garden.

223
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:50,120
Gone every winter, back every spring.

224
00:19:53,624 --> 00:19:55,417
You religious at all?

225
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:58,754
I try to keep an open mind.

226
00:19:59,088 --> 00:20:01,131
That's good. That's very good.

227
00:20:02,424 --> 00:20:04,134
Where are my trilliums?

228
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:07,513
Oh, fiddlesticks. Do me a blessing, child.

229
00:20:07,971 --> 00:20:09,807
Will you run up to the attic for me?

230
00:20:09,932 --> 00:20:13,602
I have some seed packets in a box
right next to the stairs.

231
00:23:06,024 --> 00:23:07,526
What took you?

232
00:23:08,694 --> 00:23:10,070
I'm sorry.

233
00:23:11,196 --> 00:23:13,657
I thought the key opens everything.

234
00:23:14,032 --> 00:23:16,076
The key? What key?

235
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:18,120
The key you gave me for the house.

236
00:23:18,203 --> 00:23:21,039
There's a door in the attic
it doesn't work for.

237
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:24,376
Oh, no, the attic, it's never opened that.

238
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:28,130
- I got my Dixie-Johns.
- Why not?

239
00:23:29,214 --> 00:23:31,592
- What's in there?
- I have no idea.

240
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:34,928
It's been shut ever since we moved in.

241
00:23:35,054 --> 00:23:38,974
I have to get these in the ground,
because there's rain coming.

242
00:23:39,058 --> 00:23:40,684
Mrs. Devereaux...

243
00:23:40,809 --> 00:23:44,313
Ben was in the attic, wasn't he,
when he had his stroke?

244
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,694
What was he doing in there?

245
00:23:50,903 --> 00:23:53,113
You'll have to ask him, child.

246
00:23:54,323 --> 00:23:56,992
Be a dear and go see to him, won't you?

247
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,746
I wonder if he wouldn't like some iced tea.

248
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,632
His door was locked.

249
00:26:19,385 --> 00:26:20,427
Ben!

250
00:26:28,977 --> 00:26:30,312
Ben!

251
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:33,524
Ben!

252
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:39,780
Stop right there, Ben! Don't move!

253
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:48,664
Stop!

254
00:26:50,249 --> 00:26:51,708
Ben!

255
00:26:55,087 --> 00:26:56,630
Mrs. Devereaux!

256
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:05,055
Ben!

257
00:27:06,849 --> 00:27:09,184
Ben, what are you doing? It's me!

258
00:27:11,937 --> 00:27:13,772
Mother of mercy, what's he done?

259
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,275
He got out of the window. I thought
you said he was bedridden.

260
00:27:16,358 --> 00:27:17,443
He's having spasms.

261
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:19,153
- Didn't you give him his remedies?
- Yes.

262
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:20,487
Did you make sure he drank them down?

263
00:27:20,612 --> 00:27:21,697
I thought so.

264
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,991
- Ben, what'd they make you do?
- His door was locked.

265
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:27,035
Just go get the wheelchair.
We've got to get him out of this.

266
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:28,203
What about a doctor?

267
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,290
In the morning,
just get that wheelchair now.

268
00:27:43,552 --> 00:27:44,928
Caroline!

269
00:27:52,728 --> 00:27:54,146
Caroline!

270
00:27:56,148 --> 00:27:58,150
What in damnation took you so long?

271
00:27:58,233 --> 00:27:59,693
I came as fast as I could.

272
00:27:59,818 --> 00:28:03,113
We're just going to have to double his
remedies. That's all I can think of.

273
00:28:03,238 --> 00:28:05,657
Caroline, help me here. Help me get him.

274
00:28:09,828 --> 00:28:11,789
Come on. That's it.

275
00:28:37,439 --> 00:28:39,983
Where did you think you were going?

276
00:28:47,533 --> 00:28:51,161
You're here two days and
he already tried to kill himself.

277
00:28:51,286 --> 00:28:53,831
Must have some kind of
bedside manner, huh?

278
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,542
One of my many charms.

279
00:28:58,043 --> 00:29:01,213
So, what exactly happened?
I came to update her will...

280
00:29:01,964 --> 00:29:04,466
she's up with the doc, says he fell?

281
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:06,343
He did fall.

282
00:29:07,302 --> 00:29:09,555
Like what, from his wheelchair?

283
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,938
You cannot be serious. From
up there? He fell from up there?

284
00:29:18,313 --> 00:29:20,232
How? He can't even walk.

285
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:25,696
Please don't tell me you're quitting.
I have to start over again.

286
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:29,032
Will you shut the door?
I want to show you something.

287
00:29:30,826 --> 00:29:32,911
You know what my mama used to say?

288
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:36,749
If a lady invites you into her room,
she probably isn't much of a lady.

289
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:41,128
Homespun Southern wisdom grows
on trees around here, doesn't it?

290
00:29:41,503 --> 00:29:43,714
I found this in Ben's room...

291
00:29:43,922 --> 00:29:45,299
last night.

292
00:29:45,424 --> 00:29:47,176
Found what? His laundry?

293
00:29:47,342 --> 00:29:48,927
No, it had a...

294
00:29:49,011 --> 00:29:51,221
- There was...
- Had a what?

295
00:29:51,346 --> 00:29:53,474
There was a... It had a...

296
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:57,186
Forget it.

297
00:29:58,437 --> 00:30:00,022
I thought it...

298
00:30:00,105 --> 00:30:02,232
I don't know what I thought.

299
00:30:03,442 --> 00:30:04,943
I admire you.

300
00:30:05,444 --> 00:30:07,321
You know, what you do.

301
00:30:08,197 --> 00:30:10,491
Hell, I wouldn't be able
to take care of my own parents.

302
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:11,867
You'd regret it.

303
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:15,454
I quit college to help out
with some friends' bands.

304
00:30:15,954 --> 00:30:18,373
Out all night, always on the road.

305
00:30:19,041 --> 00:30:22,086
My father thought
I was throwing my life away.

306
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,713
So we didn't talk, didn't visit.

307
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,549
Stubborn and proud,
and that's how we left it.

308
00:30:27,883 --> 00:30:29,343
You mean...

309
00:30:30,052 --> 00:30:31,095
Yeah.

310
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:36,558
He was gone before
I even knew he was sick.

311
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:44,733
I guess he wanted to spare me from all this.

312
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,152
Is that so wrong?

313
00:30:49,405 --> 00:30:51,740
No one should have to die alone.

314
00:30:55,077 --> 00:30:56,954
So tell me what you were going to tell me.

315
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,247
About Ben.

316
00:31:06,004 --> 00:31:07,965
Do you ever feel like...

317
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:11,593
he's asking you for help?

318
00:31:11,677 --> 00:31:13,887
- Asking me?
- With a look or...

319
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,181
a touch.

320
00:31:16,932 --> 00:31:18,392
Mr. Marshall?

321
00:31:18,517 --> 00:31:21,729
Where in damnation is that boy? Caroline...

322
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:24,189
have you seen Mr...

323
00:31:27,025 --> 00:31:28,277
Well...

324
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:31,989
I see the children are getting acquainted.

325
00:31:32,865 --> 00:31:34,366
Now, Violet...

326
00:31:34,867 --> 00:31:36,869
you know you're the only woman in my life.

327
00:31:36,952 --> 00:31:40,289
I know no such things,
and remove your perspirations.

328
00:31:41,206 --> 00:31:43,667
The doctor has departed, so I'm ready...

329
00:31:43,792 --> 00:31:47,004
to discuss estate matters,
if you have finished...

330
00:31:47,129 --> 00:31:49,423
soliciting your new business.

331
00:31:59,224 --> 00:32:00,267
All right.

332
00:32:01,143 --> 00:32:03,187
Whenever you get the time.

333
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:08,080
Caroline?

334
00:35:09,248 --> 00:35:11,291
I'm making some sweet tea.

335
00:35:12,418 --> 00:35:14,169
Are you interested?

336
00:35:18,674 --> 00:35:20,008
Caroline?

337
00:35:37,443 --> 00:35:38,861
"Sacrifice."

338
00:35:40,195 --> 00:35:41,947
Are you in the house?

339
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,758
Caroline?

340
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:49,973
You're forgetful, child.

341
00:37:47,156 --> 00:37:49,241
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

342
00:37:49,324 --> 00:37:50,951
<i>From the dry dust...</i>

343
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:52,995
<i>out of these chains...</i>

344
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:55,205
<i>from the devil's house.</i>

345
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,125
<i>It is time, Lord...</i>

346
00:37:58,417 --> 00:37:59,752
<i>to take me...</i>

347
00:38:00,461 --> 00:38:04,506
<i>from the dry dust,
break me from these chains.</i>

348
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:07,801
<i>Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

349
00:38:07,926 --> 00:38:10,429
<i>Take me out of darkness.</i>

350
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,807
<i>Walk me out of blindness.</i>

351
00:38:13,932 --> 00:38:16,393
<i>Lift me out of sadness.</i>

352
00:38:16,685 --> 00:38:19,021
<i>Save me from my damned-ness.</i>

353
00:38:19,188 --> 00:38:20,606
<i>Please, Lord.</i>

354
00:38:21,815 --> 00:38:23,317
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

355
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:27,071
<i>Take me from the dry dust. Break me...</i>

356
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:32,159
<i>out of these chains.
Bring me from the devil's house.</i>

357
00:38:32,242 --> 00:38:34,119
<i>Take me out of--</i>

358
00:38:38,624 --> 00:38:40,334
Just a local band.

359
00:38:44,463 --> 00:38:46,382
How about you buy me a drink?

360
00:38:48,425 --> 00:38:51,345
Whatever it is, it's not your average attic.

361
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:54,848
She says it's been locked up
ever since they first moved in.

362
00:38:56,308 --> 00:38:58,560
You found yourself a hoodoo room.

363
00:39:01,897 --> 00:39:05,317
- A what?
- Hoodoo. You know what hoodoo is?

364
00:39:06,235 --> 00:39:07,945
It's like voodoo, right?

365
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:10,864
Wrong. Voodoo's a religion.

366
00:39:11,365 --> 00:39:13,450
Slaves brought it to Haiti from Africa.

367
00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:15,828
You worship God, heaven and hell.

368
00:39:15,994 --> 00:39:17,830
- How's hoodoo different?
- It's magic.

369
00:39:17,996 --> 00:39:21,208
American folk magic.
God doesn't have much to do with it.

370
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:22,793
- Magic?
- Yeah.

371
00:39:22,918 --> 00:39:26,213
It's part African, part European,
part Native American.

372
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:28,340
And New Orleans is its home.
It started here.

373
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:31,760
My Aunt Nola's into it.
She shops at a place in Algiers.

374
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:35,889
Look, you said the house
had a history, right?

375
00:39:36,014 --> 00:39:38,767
- Hoodoo is pretty harmless.
- Harmless how?

376
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:41,603
It's psychological, like a lot of that stuff.

377
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:44,356
It can't hurt you if you don't believe.

378
00:39:45,357 --> 00:39:47,860
So this place your aunt shops at...

379
00:39:48,193 --> 00:39:49,695
Ever seen it?

380
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:55,117
It's either this street or the next one...

381
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:57,536
or the next one.

382
00:40:00,205 --> 00:40:01,331
There.

383
00:40:02,708 --> 00:40:04,501
There? That's a Laundromat.

384
00:40:04,626 --> 00:40:07,713
Look, that's all I know.
That's where she goes.

385
00:40:10,966 --> 00:40:12,634
So you coming in or what?

386
00:40:13,135 --> 00:40:14,303
I'm not.

387
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,305
I thought you don't believe in this stuff.

388
00:40:16,472 --> 00:40:17,514
I don't.

389
00:40:17,639 --> 00:40:19,475
But I'm not just going
to mess around with it.

390
00:40:19,558 --> 00:40:21,602
So, you want to go in, go ahead.

391
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:24,563
You're scared.

392
00:40:24,646 --> 00:40:27,399
- Jill the Thrill is scared.
- Kiss my ass.

393
00:40:27,483 --> 00:40:30,152
You're never going to live this down.
We come all the way out here--

394
00:40:30,235 --> 00:40:31,779
I'm not scared.

395
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:28,377
Good night, Caroline.

396
00:41:30,838 --> 00:41:32,214
Good night.

397
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:23,724
I told you about the mirrors.

398
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:24,933
I don't understand.

399
00:42:25,059 --> 00:42:26,602
This is not your house.

400
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:29,229
I found them.
I needed a mirror for my bathroom--

401
00:42:29,354 --> 00:42:32,566
I told you, and you heard me. No mirrors.

402
00:42:33,859 --> 00:42:35,194
No mirrors!

403
00:42:39,198 --> 00:42:40,824
I've seen the room.

404
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:45,746
- What room?
- The room you say you've never seen.

405
00:42:49,041 --> 00:42:50,417
It's not locked anymore.

406
00:42:50,542 --> 00:42:53,045
No, child, you don't know
what you've seen.

407
00:42:53,128 --> 00:42:55,255
You're going to tell me right now.

408
00:42:55,714 --> 00:42:57,257
Or I'm leaving.

409
00:43:07,976 --> 00:43:09,978
You're not from the South.

410
00:43:10,938 --> 00:43:12,689
You won't understand.

411
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:16,276
That room up there,
you just don't go in and...

412
00:43:16,402 --> 00:43:18,904
throw things out of a room like that.

413
00:43:19,655 --> 00:43:22,408
You leave them just where you found them.

414
00:43:24,201 --> 00:43:26,995
The house is theirs just as much as ours.

415
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:31,542
The house is whose?
Whose things are in that room?

416
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,377
All right.

417
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,714
About 90 years ago...

418
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:40,843
there was a banker here,
his name was Thorpe.

419
00:43:41,593 --> 00:43:43,762
He made his fortune cheating the poor.

420
00:43:43,929 --> 00:43:46,724
He was a mean man. He was a cruel man.

421
00:43:47,015 --> 00:43:50,060
It was him, and his family,
and couple of servants...

422
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:54,523
name of Mama Cecile and Papa Justify.

423
00:43:55,774 --> 00:43:57,025
Sit down.

424
00:43:57,192 --> 00:43:58,485
Now...

425
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:02,406
the way I heard it, old man Thorpe,
he didn't know...

426
00:44:03,282 --> 00:44:06,243
that Papa Justify was
a "two-headed doctor."

427
00:44:07,286 --> 00:44:10,956
He was a conjure man. So was Cecile.

428
00:44:12,458 --> 00:44:14,585
- They believed in--
- Hoodoo.

429
00:44:16,962 --> 00:44:18,047
Yeah.

430
00:44:21,884 --> 00:44:23,677
That was their room.

431
00:44:28,849 --> 00:44:31,643
<i>They were famous
all through the bayous.</i>

432
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:35,147
<i>They healed the sick
and they hurt the mean.</i>

433
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:39,485
"Hit a straight lick with a crooked
stick," as the coloreds say.

434
00:44:39,985 --> 00:44:43,781
But old Thorpe, he just saw them as help.

435
00:44:44,573 --> 00:44:46,825
And he worked them to the bone.

436
00:44:47,409 --> 00:44:48,994
He abused them.

437
00:44:50,329 --> 00:44:53,290
Until one night, as the story goes...

438
00:44:55,209 --> 00:44:56,668
there was a party.

439
00:44:59,171 --> 00:45:03,467
<i>It was the bank's anniversary,
all the big mucketymucks were here.</i>

440
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:06,804
<i>Politicians, sugar barons, riverboat tycoons.</i>

441
00:45:07,513 --> 00:45:10,349
<i>There was a lot of drinking and dancing...</i>

442
00:45:11,266 --> 00:45:13,727
<i>and a couple of trysts, I'm sure.</i>

443
00:45:16,438 --> 00:45:19,483
<i>And then, finally,
when it was time to say farewell...</i>

444
00:45:19,608 --> 00:45:23,278
<i>some of the guests wanted
to wish goodbye to the children.</i>

445
00:45:23,362 --> 00:45:26,865
<i>But nobody could find them.
They hadn't seen them in hours.</i>

446
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,660
<i>So, being all full of brandy,
they made it a game.</i>

447
00:45:29,785 --> 00:45:31,787
<i>"Let's Find the Children."</i>

448
00:45:32,204 --> 00:45:34,331
<i>Room after room after room.</i>

449
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:38,127
<i>Finally, someone heard music...</i>

450
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:39,837
Martin? Grace?

451
00:45:39,962 --> 00:45:42,381
<i>...and voices and shouting...</i>

452
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:44,758
<i>up in the attic.</i>

453
00:45:44,883 --> 00:45:46,927
<i>From the devil's house.</i>

454
00:45:47,970 --> 00:45:49,680
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

455
00:45:49,805 --> 00:45:52,725
<i>The servants were up there
with the children.</i>

456
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:56,228
<i>They were trying to teach them
how to conjure hoodoo.</i>

457
00:45:56,311 --> 00:45:58,021
And take his head.

458
00:45:59,481 --> 00:46:03,110
<i>Thorpe went about insane,
and so did the rest of the guests.</i>

459
00:46:05,404 --> 00:46:08,282
<i>I mean, how long had this blasphemy
been going on?</i>

460
00:46:09,324 --> 00:46:13,162
<i>The children said it was their
fault, that they'd wanted to learn.</i>

461
00:46:13,746 --> 00:46:16,081
<i>But they weren't having any of that.</i>

462
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:42,733
<i>All that power and rage and insanity.</i>

463
00:46:52,618 --> 00:46:54,244
<i>The party was over.</i>

464
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,718
It was a terrible thing.

465
00:47:10,803 --> 00:47:12,054
Terrible.

466
00:47:16,308 --> 00:47:19,436
Rumors got out, but no arrests, no trial.

467
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:23,065
Money had its way.

468
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:28,320
What happened to the family?

469
00:47:28,404 --> 00:47:30,114
The bank went under.

470
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:34,576
Thorpe shot his wife to death,
and then turned the gun on himself.

471
00:47:37,246 --> 00:47:41,041
People in the bayou say
it was Justify and Cecile's revenge.

472
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,169
The children stayed here till '62.

473
00:47:45,671 --> 00:47:49,925
But they never, ever, told us
why that room was locked.

474
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:54,763
Or why there were no mirrors
in the whole house.

475
00:47:57,349 --> 00:47:58,726
Now we know.

476
00:47:59,184 --> 00:48:00,686
You know what?

477
00:48:03,105 --> 00:48:05,899
You see them in the mirrors.

478
00:48:07,526 --> 00:48:08,610
Who?

479
00:48:08,861 --> 00:48:10,195
The servants.

480
00:48:11,029 --> 00:48:14,116
I've gone and read
some hoodoo books, and they say...

481
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:17,202
- putting brick dust down'll keep harm away.
- Mrs. Devereaux.

482
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:20,205
So I made a big circle of it around
the whole house.

483
00:48:20,289 --> 00:48:24,126
You can't expect me to believe
you see ghosts in your mirrors.

484
00:48:27,546 --> 00:48:29,506
The ghosts are here now.

485
00:48:32,301 --> 00:48:34,553
But whatever they did to him...

486
00:48:35,387 --> 00:48:38,057
I am not going to let them do it to me.

487
00:48:45,147 --> 00:48:46,899
Now you'll leave...

488
00:48:48,484 --> 00:48:50,527
like all the rest of them.

489
00:49:50,963 --> 00:49:54,216
That's some superstitious wife
you got there, Ben.

490
00:49:54,717 --> 00:49:57,428
She thinks you have ghosts in the attic.

491
00:49:58,387 --> 00:49:59,722
Spooky, huh?

492
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:01,765
Ouch.

493
00:50:03,308 --> 00:50:05,811
Hold on. I'll be right back.

494
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:25,164
She says you see them in the mirrors.

495
00:50:26,832 --> 00:50:28,709
Ghosts in the mirrors.

496
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,538
I'm sorry, Ben.

497
00:51:10,292 --> 00:51:11,752
Ben, stop it.

498
00:51:14,463 --> 00:51:17,007
Relax. I'm so...

499
00:51:17,883 --> 00:51:19,301
I'm so sorry.

500
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,222
I'm so sorry.

501
00:51:25,557 --> 00:51:27,142
You see them, too.

502
00:51:36,735 --> 00:51:38,362
I'm going to town.

503
00:51:38,737 --> 00:51:39,905
Shopping.

504
00:51:40,823 --> 00:51:42,616
What for, Caroline?

505
00:51:45,494 --> 00:51:47,454
Caroline, what for?

506
00:51:47,746 --> 00:51:49,415
We'll just have to see.

507
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:35,085
He won't beat you again.

508
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:37,880
Mama Cynthia,
he beat me last night.

509
00:52:38,047 --> 00:52:41,175
You use the potion
that I'm going to fix for you...

510
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,719
and it won't happen again.
I will promise you that.

511
00:52:43,886 --> 00:52:46,388
- I'm scared.
- Don't be afraid.

512
00:52:46,555 --> 00:52:47,973
Are you sure that I can do it?

513
00:52:48,057 --> 00:52:49,600
I know it will. It will work.

514
00:52:49,725 --> 00:52:52,061
Just do as I say. Don't be afraid.

515
00:52:52,144 --> 00:52:54,855
It will work, and it won't happen again, ever.

516
00:52:55,064 --> 00:52:57,775
Don't worry about it. He won't hit you again.

517
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:02,029
Just use this potion I mixed up.
I have a lot of things in here.

518
00:53:02,404 --> 00:53:04,281
And you use it as I told you.

519
00:53:04,406 --> 00:53:07,076
- Okay, I'll trust you, Mama.
- You'll do fine.

520
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,003
That brick dust at the door,
how does it work?

521
00:53:18,670 --> 00:53:20,422
You lay a line down.

522
00:53:20,589 --> 00:53:24,093
Nobody that means you harm can cross it.

523
00:53:24,593 --> 00:53:27,221
It's how you tell who your enemies are.

524
00:53:29,431 --> 00:53:31,517
It's like hypnotism, right?

525
00:53:32,351 --> 00:53:33,602
Suggestion?

526
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,232
And when this stuff works, it's
because someone believes it works?

527
00:53:39,691 --> 00:53:42,444
And if you thought, you know...

528
00:53:43,195 --> 00:53:45,072
magic made you sick...

529
00:53:45,948 --> 00:53:48,450
you might believe in a magic cure, right?

530
00:53:49,034 --> 00:53:50,869
Even though it's all in your head.

531
00:53:50,953 --> 00:53:52,579
Somebody been working roots on you.

532
00:53:52,705 --> 00:53:55,374
Say I knew someone
who believed he'd been...

533
00:53:55,708 --> 00:53:57,918
- Crossed.
- Crossed.

534
00:54:00,045 --> 00:54:02,381
Would he believe he could be uncrossed?

535
00:54:02,548 --> 00:54:04,508
What's the nature of his condition?

536
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:07,428
He can't speak. Barely moves.
He had a stroke...

537
00:54:08,637 --> 00:54:10,973
but he seems to think
someone else made him that way.

538
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:13,308
And you want to know
what happened to him?

539
00:54:13,475 --> 00:54:14,601
Yes.

540
00:54:26,989 --> 00:54:29,867
<i>You went in there.
You actually went in.</i>

541
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:31,118
Are you out of your mind?

542
00:54:31,243 --> 00:54:33,996
Come on. Haven't you ever heard
of psychosomatic treatment?

543
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:36,957
Yeah. But this is not that.

544
00:54:37,082 --> 00:54:40,961
How much of a patient's recovery
depends on his believing he can?

545
00:54:41,086 --> 00:54:43,005
What recovery? This is hospice.

546
00:54:43,088 --> 00:54:44,965
You're just supposed to help this guy die.

547
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:46,633
He believes in this stuff.

548
00:54:46,759 --> 00:54:48,677
So what? Who is he to you?

549
00:54:48,927 --> 00:54:49,970
Forget it.

550
00:54:50,095 --> 00:54:52,848
No, you forget it. He's not your dad.

551
00:54:52,931 --> 00:54:54,558
Not this one, the last, or the one before.

552
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:56,852
Why are the two of you so attached?

553
00:54:58,687 --> 00:55:00,439
I'm sorry, Cary.

554
00:55:00,522 --> 00:55:02,316
Just so you know,
if I'm not attached to him...

555
00:55:02,441 --> 00:55:03,901
I'm abandoning him.

556
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:05,944
Attached is better.

557
00:55:06,111 --> 00:55:09,656
I know. Cary, I'm sorry. Okay?

558
00:55:10,032 --> 00:55:11,950
But would you look at yourself?

559
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:15,120
You want to be a nurse and you
just walked out of a witch doctor's.

560
00:55:15,204 --> 00:55:16,663
It's not for me.

561
00:55:26,298 --> 00:55:28,509
<i>Forecasters are calling
for up to a foot of rain...</i>

562
00:55:28,634 --> 00:55:29,718
<i>in the coastal areas...</i>

563
00:55:29,885 --> 00:55:33,180
<i>as this storm makes its way across
the delta, starting overnight.</i>

564
00:55:33,305 --> 00:55:36,308
<i>Radar already shows
increasing precipitation...</i>

565
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:39,436
<i>across the coastal areas and moving
rather quickly to the north.</i>

566
00:55:39,561 --> 00:55:42,731
<i>The main forecast concerns
centers around potential...</i>

567
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:48,779
Hi, Ben.

568
00:55:51,907 --> 00:55:53,909
I'm going to show you something.

569
00:55:56,245 --> 00:56:00,666
It's going to be our secret. You and me.

570
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:07,756
Violet says you didn't have a stroke...

571
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:11,885
in the attic. She said some ghosts...

572
00:56:12,177 --> 00:56:14,555
made you this way with a spell.

573
00:56:16,098 --> 00:56:17,933
Is that what you think?

574
00:56:19,268 --> 00:56:21,520
Because I know a spell, too, Ben.

575
00:56:23,355 --> 00:56:25,107
One that makes you better.

576
00:56:36,952 --> 00:56:39,413
All you have to do is believe it.

577
00:57:08,984 --> 00:57:10,319
Backwards.

578
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:16,116
Cleanse this man.

579
00:57:17,159 --> 00:57:18,869
Cleanse this room.

580
00:57:19,995 --> 00:57:21,663
Cleanse this house.

581
00:57:26,668 --> 00:57:30,339
His words have gotten lost,
lost and wandering in his mind.

582
00:57:31,006 --> 00:57:32,966
Let the water run down...

583
00:57:33,842 --> 00:57:36,136
and wash away this condition.

584
00:57:40,349 --> 00:57:44,978
His tongue has gotten tied,
tied and tangled in his throat.

585
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:47,648
Let the water run down...

586
00:57:49,024 --> 00:57:51,235
and wash away this affliction.

587
00:57:55,114 --> 00:57:58,158
Send his voice to go free.

588
00:57:59,368 --> 00:58:01,328
Let the water run down...

589
00:58:01,704 --> 00:58:02,746
and wash away--

590
00:58:17,553 --> 00:58:19,555
Caroline.

591
00:58:28,564 --> 00:58:30,399
Caroline.

592
00:58:32,651 --> 00:58:35,362
It's all in your head.

593
00:58:36,905 --> 00:58:39,074
Help. Help.

594
00:58:40,993 --> 00:58:43,704
Ben, talk to me. Keep talking.

595
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:45,289
Help me.

596
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:50,210
Help you? Help you how, Ben?

597
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,839
Get me out of here.

598
00:58:55,007 --> 00:58:56,425
Caroline?

599
00:58:58,677 --> 00:59:01,180
Get me out of here!

600
00:59:02,848 --> 00:59:03,932
Shit!

601
00:59:04,016 --> 00:59:06,060
- Caroline!
- Just a second.

602
00:59:06,185 --> 00:59:08,103
Caroline, open this door!

603
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:10,564
What are you doing to him?

604
00:59:10,689 --> 00:59:12,691
Ben, why? Get out of here, why?

605
00:59:12,775 --> 00:59:15,152
- Caroline!
- One second!

606
00:59:15,611 --> 00:59:16,737
Caroline, open this door!

607
00:59:16,862 --> 00:59:18,822
I'll help you, I promise. Just talk to me.

608
00:59:18,947 --> 00:59:22,618
What happened to you in that attic?
Tell me who you're afraid of.

609
00:59:25,204 --> 00:59:26,872
What have you done?

610
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:30,959
What is this?

611
00:59:31,043 --> 00:59:32,294
He was...

612
00:59:32,461 --> 00:59:35,255
- He was struggling in his sleep--
- Get away from him.

613
00:59:35,381 --> 00:59:37,716
- Get away from him.
- He was struggling.

614
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:40,219
It's all right.

615
00:59:40,552 --> 00:59:41,595
I brought water.

616
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,055
You were talking to him?

617
00:59:43,138 --> 00:59:46,475
I was just telling him a story
to settle him down.

618
00:59:46,558 --> 00:59:49,019
- About what?
- Just a story.

619
00:59:51,980 --> 00:59:53,357
No ghosts.

620
00:59:54,983 --> 00:59:57,653
That'll be all tonight, Caroline. Thank you.

621
00:59:59,154 --> 01:00:00,531
I'll come back to check on him--

622
01:00:00,656 --> 01:00:04,535
No, that won't be necessary.
That's all for tonight. Good night.

623
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:37,317
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

624
01:00:57,880 --> 01:00:59,381
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

625
01:01:00,883 --> 01:01:02,051
Grace.

626
01:01:02,134 --> 01:01:03,385
<i>Caroline?</i>

627
01:01:04,136 --> 01:01:05,387
Caroline.

628
01:01:50,099 --> 01:01:51,683
Mrs. Devereaux?

629
01:02:17,126 --> 01:02:19,586
Her and her ghost shit.

630
01:02:41,316 --> 01:02:43,819
<i>That attic is filled
with this stuff.</i>

631
01:02:43,902 --> 01:02:47,156
Recipes. Spells. Books of them.
Records of them.

632
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:49,533
I understand your cause of concern...

633
01:02:50,242 --> 01:02:53,537
but my family is superstitious, too.
We're called Baptists.

634
01:02:53,912 --> 01:02:55,748
- This is different.
- It's charming.

635
01:02:55,914 --> 01:02:56,957
Local color.

636
01:02:57,082 --> 01:02:59,918
You said yourself
you were worried about him.

637
01:03:00,002 --> 01:03:04,048
Well, now I'm worried about you.
You know?

638
01:03:04,173 --> 01:03:06,175
Are you a nurse or a detective?

639
01:03:09,595 --> 01:03:11,930
When did you first meet the Devereauxs?

640
01:03:12,097 --> 01:03:13,807
Just before he had his stroke.

641
01:03:13,932 --> 01:03:16,018
They were looking for a lawyer
to update their wills.

642
01:03:16,185 --> 01:03:18,437
Did you ever think that
maybe she knew something...

643
01:03:18,604 --> 01:03:19,897
was going to happen to him?

644
01:03:20,022 --> 01:03:24,359
How? Like tarot cards in the attic?
A séance in her sleep?

645
01:03:25,444 --> 01:03:28,072
I want to know why the last girl quit.

646
01:03:28,697 --> 01:03:31,116
Hallie. Some folks to see you.

647
01:03:32,451 --> 01:03:34,661
<i>You a superstitious person?</i>

648
01:03:34,787 --> 01:03:36,288
Not per se.

649
01:03:36,372 --> 01:03:38,165
I told my mama
where I was working.

650
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,959
She said that house has been
nothing but blood and tears.

651
01:03:41,043 --> 01:03:44,546
That the last owners were
some rich brother and sister.

652
01:03:44,713 --> 01:03:46,632
Crazy people, supposedly.

653
01:03:47,466 --> 01:03:50,511
They died of strokes
right after they sold the place.

654
01:03:50,636 --> 01:03:53,180
Maybe they found something they shouldn't.

655
01:03:53,889 --> 01:03:55,808
Maybe now Ben did, too.

656
01:03:56,642 --> 01:03:59,103
It may be their mess in that room...

657
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:02,689
but ain't no ghosts
put a spell on that old man.

658
01:04:03,148 --> 01:04:04,358
She did.

659
01:04:04,733 --> 01:04:06,944
- Do you believe that?
- Don't you?

660
01:04:07,069 --> 01:04:08,904
But I heard it can't hurt you.

661
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:11,865
I mean, it can't hurt you if you don't believe.

662
01:04:12,241 --> 01:04:15,619
Then I suggest you leave that house
before you do.

663
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:22,459
For God's sake, this is insane.
The man had a stroke.

664
01:04:22,584 --> 01:04:23,794
That isn't what he thinks.

665
01:04:23,919 --> 01:04:26,296
And you're going to take him away
from her? From his own wife?

666
01:04:26,422 --> 01:04:29,800
- How can you believe--
- I don't believe. I don't.

667
01:04:29,925 --> 01:04:31,802
The point is, he does.

668
01:04:32,594 --> 01:04:33,762
Stop the car.

669
01:04:33,929 --> 01:04:35,472
- Stop the car.
- Why?

670
01:04:35,597 --> 01:04:39,226
I've been here before.
I'll show you. It's not just them.

671
01:04:46,775 --> 01:04:49,653
See the line across the doorway?
It's brick dust.

672
01:04:49,778 --> 01:04:51,780
Hoodoo. Keeps your enemies
from coming across.

673
01:04:51,947 --> 01:04:53,323
See the bones hanging?

674
01:04:53,449 --> 01:04:55,117
This stuff's got a hold on people out here.

675
01:04:55,284 --> 01:04:57,202
Yeah, but it's not real.

676
01:04:58,037 --> 01:05:01,331
It doesn't matter if it's not real.
It's real to them.

677
01:05:04,126 --> 01:05:05,502
What's wrong?

678
01:05:07,129 --> 01:05:09,840
This music. I know this music.

679
01:05:10,382 --> 01:05:12,468
You sure this is a good idea?

680
01:05:14,219 --> 01:05:15,345
Hello?

681
01:05:20,809 --> 01:05:22,728
Mama raised a gentleman.

682
01:05:26,648 --> 01:05:28,025
Hello?

683
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:29,985
Excuse me. Ma'am?

684
01:05:33,405 --> 01:05:35,657
We heard the music, your record.
I was wondering--

685
01:05:35,824 --> 01:05:38,327
There's no record for anyone here.

686
01:05:39,995 --> 01:05:43,916
How about records by a man named Justify?

687
01:05:48,337 --> 01:05:50,130
How do you know that name?

688
01:05:50,923 --> 01:05:52,383
Who sent you?

689
01:05:55,761 --> 01:05:57,429
Who else is in here?

690
01:05:57,846 --> 01:06:00,391
- Someone else in here?
- It's just me, ma'am.

691
01:06:00,516 --> 01:06:02,351
Stop now. Don't you go touching--

692
01:06:02,434 --> 01:06:05,521
<i>Do you know a record called
the Conjure of Sacrifice?</i>

693
01:06:08,941 --> 01:06:11,026
Because I have it, if you do.

694
01:06:11,777 --> 01:06:14,738
You had that, you wouldn't say so.

695
01:06:14,863 --> 01:06:16,323
You do know it.

696
01:06:17,366 --> 01:06:22,287
The strongest conjuration of all.
They say Justify discovered it...

697
01:06:22,705 --> 01:06:25,791
but he got killed
before he learned to work it.

698
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:30,879
Him and his poor wife both.
It's never been found.

699
01:06:31,547 --> 01:06:32,923
What does it do?

700
01:06:33,048 --> 01:06:34,967
It keeps you from dying.

701
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:38,262
Not forever, but for a while.

702
01:06:39,138 --> 01:06:40,180
How?

703
01:06:40,305 --> 01:06:42,933
You have to sacrifice somebody...

704
01:06:43,392 --> 01:06:46,019
and take the years that they have left.

705
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:56,280
Hurry up! He's alone with her!

706
01:06:56,405 --> 01:06:59,700
Hang on, Caroline! Wait! Shit!

707
01:07:00,993 --> 01:07:02,077
Now you got me spooked.

708
01:07:02,161 --> 01:07:04,788
If I get proof that she's out
to hurt him, will you stick by me--

709
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:07,249
- By "hurt him," you mean kill him.
- Will you or won't you?

710
01:07:07,416 --> 01:07:09,001
Just listen to yourself.

711
01:07:09,168 --> 01:07:10,210
Fine. Goodbye.

712
01:07:10,335 --> 01:07:11,795
What are you going to do here, kidnap him?

713
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,965
You know something's wrong
between them. You know it.

714
01:07:15,090 --> 01:07:17,426
Let me make some calls.
See about grounds for...

715
01:07:17,593 --> 01:07:19,344
a restraining order, protective custody.

716
01:07:19,511 --> 01:07:21,597
You're not going to get a search
warrant till tomorrow anyhow.

717
01:07:21,764 --> 01:07:23,682
Then that'll give me tonight.

718
01:07:25,017 --> 01:07:27,436
I'm all he's got, Luke. Me.

719
01:07:29,271 --> 01:07:31,148
Get the proof. Okay?

720
01:07:39,948 --> 01:07:41,909
Mrs. Devereaux, I'm back.

721
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:11,897
No. Where's the record?

722
01:08:14,149 --> 01:08:15,734
It was right here.

723
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:02,781
Mrs. Devereaux,
could you come here for a second?

724
01:09:05,117 --> 01:09:07,119
Caroline, I was beginning to worry
about you...

725
01:09:07,202 --> 01:09:08,662
you were gone such a long while.

726
01:09:08,787 --> 01:09:10,372
It's really raining out there.

727
01:09:10,456 --> 01:09:12,166
It's supposed to pour all night.

728
01:09:12,291 --> 01:09:14,418
Keeps up like this,
that swamp's going to rise...

729
01:09:14,543 --> 01:09:16,420
and ruin my flowerbeds.

730
01:09:17,796 --> 01:09:19,465
Did you want to see me?

731
01:09:19,798 --> 01:09:21,842
Yeah, I was wondering if
you could take a look at this?

732
01:09:21,967 --> 01:09:23,343
There's a leak up here.

733
01:09:23,469 --> 01:09:26,430
They're all over the house.
They're just rainwater.

734
01:09:28,223 --> 01:09:30,559
Yes, but if you look up close...

735
01:09:32,311 --> 01:09:35,105
Come on in. I could show it to you better.

736
01:09:46,075 --> 01:09:49,036
Actually, I have supper on the stove.

737
01:09:50,579 --> 01:09:52,331
I shouldn't leave it.

738
01:09:52,498 --> 01:09:55,834
- It'll just take a second.
- I can see perfectly from here.

739
01:09:56,001 --> 01:09:57,753
You want this for the sill?

740
01:09:58,587 --> 01:09:59,922
All right.

741
01:10:02,424 --> 01:10:05,677
Could you come into the room please,
just for a second?

742
01:10:06,345 --> 01:10:08,764
So I can show you what I'm seeing.

743
01:10:13,602 --> 01:10:15,771
You're a funny one, Caroline.

744
01:10:19,608 --> 01:10:21,193
I'll make us some tea.

745
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,702
And, Caroline?

746
01:10:30,035 --> 01:10:32,496
After you've given Mr. Devereaux
his remedies...

747
01:10:32,621 --> 01:10:35,708
would you be so kind
as to join an old lady for supper?

748
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:37,418
- Well, I--
- Wonderful!

749
01:10:37,543 --> 01:10:39,545
We should have done it days ago.

750
01:10:39,712 --> 01:10:41,880
I've made something real nice.

751
01:10:54,059 --> 01:10:55,853
We're leaving tonight.

752
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,988
Caroline!

753
01:11:07,740 --> 01:11:08,907
Supper.

754
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,557
How's your gumbo?

755
01:11:34,099 --> 01:11:35,601
I haven't started.

756
01:11:35,684 --> 01:11:38,062
Would you like sugar for your tea?
I put it out for you.

757
01:11:38,187 --> 01:11:40,439
No, I don't think I'll have any sugar tonight.

758
01:11:40,564 --> 01:11:42,608
But I thought you liked it.

759
01:11:43,692 --> 01:11:45,778
You always have sugar in your tea.

760
01:11:46,612 --> 01:11:48,614
You think I'm senile, don't you?

761
01:11:49,114 --> 01:11:51,658
Ghosts in the attic. Spells on my husband.

762
01:11:51,784 --> 01:11:53,702
I just don't understand.

763
01:11:54,078 --> 01:11:56,497
These ghosts, why would they put
a spell on him and not me?

764
01:11:56,622 --> 01:11:58,457
I've been in that room, too.

765
01:11:58,832 --> 01:12:01,251
Maybe because you don't believe in them.

766
01:12:01,919 --> 01:12:04,421
Maybe all houses have spirits...

767
01:12:04,546 --> 01:12:07,508
but we just don't see them
until we believe we can.

768
01:12:11,345 --> 01:12:13,347
I'm really not that hungry.

769
01:12:15,974 --> 01:12:18,894
Don't move. I'll fetch the candles.

770
01:12:19,144 --> 01:12:22,022
Eat your gumbo. Oh, fiddlesticks.

771
01:12:43,335 --> 01:12:45,212
Dinner by candlelight.

772
01:12:46,213 --> 01:12:47,423
There.

773
01:13:03,105 --> 01:13:05,649
So, was that the storm or the ghosts?

774
01:13:06,775 --> 01:13:09,069
Well, say what you will about spirits.

775
01:13:09,194 --> 01:13:11,238
I've always wondered
if there wasn't something...

776
01:13:11,363 --> 01:13:13,073
we could learn from them.

777
01:13:13,365 --> 01:13:14,783
Like a spell?

778
01:13:17,494 --> 01:13:20,164
I have great respect for your husband.

779
01:13:20,289 --> 01:13:23,250
And whatever he thinks
happened to him, he's fighting it.

780
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,210
What did happen to him, Violet?

781
01:13:25,377 --> 01:13:27,129
You haven't touched your gumbo.

782
01:13:27,296 --> 01:13:28,338
What have you done to him?

783
01:13:28,464 --> 01:13:31,425
I made that special for you,
and you haven't even touched it.

784
01:13:31,592 --> 01:13:32,551
What have you done?

785
01:13:32,676 --> 01:13:35,387
He is my husband, and I am his wife...

786
01:13:35,471 --> 01:13:37,890
and I will do to him whatever I wish to do!

787
01:13:38,057 --> 01:13:40,059
He's not safe in this house.

788
01:13:40,225 --> 01:13:42,102
What, what...

789
01:13:42,227 --> 01:13:43,604
What is this?

790
01:13:44,063 --> 01:13:45,355
You've done something.

791
01:13:45,481 --> 01:13:48,150
He's not safe in this house. Not with you.

792
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:50,235
- This is my house.
- I'm taking him, Violet.

793
01:13:50,402 --> 01:13:51,528
No!

794
01:13:57,493 --> 01:13:59,661
Too late. Not again.

795
01:14:00,496 --> 01:14:03,415
You little whore. He's mine.

796
01:14:05,584 --> 01:14:08,921
Keep him in this house.

797
01:14:09,505 --> 01:14:10,923
Keep him in this--

798
01:14:11,507 --> 01:14:12,883
He's mine!

799
01:14:18,013 --> 01:14:19,223
"Protection."

800
01:14:32,361 --> 01:14:34,071
Where's the record?

801
01:14:43,372 --> 01:14:44,581
Oh, God.

802
01:14:50,879 --> 01:14:52,047
Got it.

803
01:14:57,469 --> 01:14:58,804
You bitch.

804
01:15:09,898 --> 01:15:11,191
Time to go.

805
01:15:26,665 --> 01:15:28,000
Come on, Ben.

806
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:30,836
I'm going to get you out of here.
Just hold on.

807
01:15:56,570 --> 01:15:57,780
Damn it!

808
01:15:59,031 --> 01:16:00,699
Keep him in this house.

809
01:16:05,704 --> 01:16:06,872
Hold on.

810
01:16:23,472 --> 01:16:24,765
Caroline?

811
01:16:37,236 --> 01:16:38,445
Oh, shit!

812
01:16:54,169 --> 01:16:55,462
Caroline.

813
01:16:59,925 --> 01:17:01,385
Come on, Ben!

814
01:17:04,513 --> 01:17:06,265
We've got to hide you, Ben.

815
01:17:24,199 --> 01:17:26,952
I'm going to get help. I won't leave you.

816
01:17:29,872 --> 01:17:30,956
Okay?

817
01:17:42,551 --> 01:17:43,844
Caroline?

818
01:17:50,225 --> 01:17:53,145
You think you can take him
out of this house?

819
01:17:53,729 --> 01:17:56,065
You think you're stronger than me?

820
01:17:57,316 --> 01:18:00,486
You've no idea how strong I am, Caroline.

821
01:18:06,367 --> 01:18:07,576
Caroline!

822
01:18:11,914 --> 01:18:14,875
You're just making it harder on yourself!

823
01:18:16,752 --> 01:18:18,212
Where are you?

824
01:18:25,094 --> 01:18:27,179
You can't get away, Caroline.

825
01:18:28,430 --> 01:18:30,140
You understand me?

826
01:18:30,766 --> 01:18:33,185
You'll never get out of here, child.

827
01:18:34,770 --> 01:18:35,979
Caroline?

828
01:18:39,274 --> 01:18:40,359
Caroline!

829
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:42,736
Stop right there!

830
01:19:37,082 --> 01:19:38,625
Thank you.

831
01:19:43,088 --> 01:19:44,173
Luke!

832
01:19:45,424 --> 01:19:46,884
Jesus Christ.

833
01:19:49,261 --> 01:19:51,513
She tried to kill me.

834
01:19:53,015 --> 01:19:54,516
She had a gun.

835
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:57,311
She knows I know. Ben's in trouble.

836
01:19:57,436 --> 01:20:01,148
He's still at the house.
Call the police, Luke. I left him.

837
01:20:01,357 --> 01:20:03,067
We got to get back out there.

838
01:20:03,150 --> 01:20:04,526
The hell we do.

839
01:20:04,693 --> 01:20:06,278
I left him there.

840
01:20:07,446 --> 01:20:10,199
You didn't leave anyone. Okay? Slow down.

841
01:20:10,532 --> 01:20:13,452
Tell me what happened.
She tried to kill you?

842
01:20:15,454 --> 01:20:16,580
Sorry.

843
01:20:18,707 --> 01:20:20,209
Mrs. Devereaux.

844
01:20:20,334 --> 01:20:22,086
To what do I owe the--

845
01:20:23,379 --> 01:20:26,090
Heard from Caroline? Why would she have--

846
01:20:27,549 --> 01:20:29,093
What's going on?

847
01:20:31,470 --> 01:20:33,597
Okay. What happened tonight?

848
01:20:35,224 --> 01:20:36,850
Hang on a second.

849
01:20:37,226 --> 01:20:39,061
We need to record this.

850
01:20:42,898 --> 01:20:45,025
Hurting him? Hurting him how?

851
01:20:48,237 --> 01:20:51,240
What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

852
01:20:53,575 --> 01:20:55,202
I am listening to you.

853
01:22:04,897 --> 01:22:06,565
Good night, child.

854
01:22:30,506 --> 01:22:32,591
A hell of a thing, isn't it?

855
01:22:33,592 --> 01:22:35,344
See, everywhere you look...

856
01:22:36,512 --> 01:22:38,722
it's a whole new world all around you.

857
01:22:38,847 --> 01:22:41,266
It's like being born.

858
01:22:41,934 --> 01:22:44,770
Or dying. Of course, I wouldn't know.

859
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:09,670
Hush, darling. I know it's hard.

860
01:23:13,298 --> 01:23:14,550
We're home!

861
01:23:14,633 --> 01:23:17,386
He's missing. She's hidden him somewhere.

862
01:23:18,387 --> 01:23:20,180
Where is he, Caroline?

863
01:23:22,141 --> 01:23:24,518
It's not him, it's me.

864
01:23:25,811 --> 01:23:28,147
You want to sacrifice me.

865
01:23:28,897 --> 01:23:30,065
Where is he, Caroline?

866
01:23:30,149 --> 01:23:32,026
Why are you helping her?

867
01:23:34,570 --> 01:23:36,447
- Is everything ready?
- No.

868
01:23:36,572 --> 01:23:38,824
I can't start anything till I know where he is.

869
01:23:38,991 --> 01:23:41,076
What's our tale if he gets away?

870
01:23:41,994 --> 01:23:43,537
Caroline...

871
01:23:43,662 --> 01:23:46,874
you will tell me exactly
where my husband is.

872
01:23:47,291 --> 01:23:51,336
There's nothing anybody can do
for him, so there's no need to try.

873
01:23:52,254 --> 01:23:53,672
Where is he?

874
01:23:55,340 --> 01:23:57,301
Where is he, Caroline?

875
01:24:01,972 --> 01:24:03,932
He's in the garden shed.

876
01:24:08,187 --> 01:24:11,315
Don't scratch her up any more
than she already is.

877
01:24:14,943 --> 01:24:16,612
She's teaching you.

878
01:24:17,071 --> 01:24:20,324
You help her kill me,
and she'll teach you how.

879
01:24:20,449 --> 01:24:21,492
Ben knew, too, didn't he?

880
01:24:21,617 --> 01:24:22,993
That's enough, Caroline.

881
01:24:23,118 --> 01:24:25,454
You want to shoot me, shoot me.

882
01:24:25,621 --> 01:24:27,623
Stop right there, Caroline!

883
01:24:37,383 --> 01:24:39,468
I want my father's picture.

884
01:24:42,096 --> 01:24:43,680
I want it with me.

885
01:24:44,556 --> 01:24:45,766
Please.

886
01:25:01,407 --> 01:25:02,741
Jesus. All right.

887
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:05,994
You want your picture,
I'll get your goddamn picture.

888
01:25:28,684 --> 01:25:29,685
Fuck!

889
01:25:36,692 --> 01:25:38,819
Violet, she's going outside!

890
01:25:47,119 --> 01:25:48,287
Violet!

891
01:26:00,799 --> 01:26:02,176
She's here!

892
01:26:03,427 --> 01:26:05,637
Quick! Go get her! Help me!

893
01:26:08,140 --> 01:26:09,391
Come on.

894
01:26:21,987 --> 01:26:23,739
She's fixed the door!

895
01:26:34,583 --> 01:26:36,919
Violet, I can't get up the stairs!

896
01:26:51,517 --> 01:26:53,769
You try to use my tricks on me?

897
01:26:59,024 --> 01:27:00,150
On me, huh?

898
01:27:28,345 --> 01:27:30,180
No!

899
01:28:02,421 --> 01:28:03,881
<i>911 emergency.</i>

900
01:28:04,006 --> 01:28:06,175
My name is Caroline Ellis.

901
01:28:06,341 --> 01:28:08,427
I'm at 1750...

902
01:28:09,428 --> 01:28:11,597
Bayou Chapelet in Terrebonne Parish.

903
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,891
I need police and paramedics.

904
01:28:14,016 --> 01:28:16,518
There are people hurt here. We're trapped.

905
01:28:16,935 --> 01:28:18,312
Please hurry.

906
01:28:25,444 --> 01:28:26,612
<i>- What time is it?
- Jill.</i>

907
01:28:26,737 --> 01:28:28,655
<i>- Jill.
- Cary?</i>

908
01:28:28,781 --> 01:28:30,282
Jill, I'm in trouble.

909
01:28:30,407 --> 01:28:31,450
Caroline?

910
01:28:31,533 --> 01:28:32,701
It's real.

911
01:28:33,369 --> 01:28:35,829
<i>- It's all real.
- You're where? What?</i>

912
01:28:36,455 --> 01:28:38,207
I'm in the Devereaux house.

913
01:28:39,124 --> 01:28:41,210
<i>What's real? What--</i>

914
01:28:42,544 --> 01:28:43,629
Jill?

915
01:28:51,887 --> 01:28:53,305
Caroline!

916
01:28:54,473 --> 01:28:56,683
You can't get away, Caroline.

917
01:29:06,068 --> 01:29:07,444
Oh, God, no.

918
01:29:08,445 --> 01:29:09,822
Caroline.

919
01:29:17,329 --> 01:29:21,375
"Chalk, sulfur, blood, hair."

920
01:29:33,011 --> 01:29:34,179
Sulfur.

921
01:29:36,849 --> 01:29:38,016
Candle.

922
01:29:38,350 --> 01:29:39,476
Chalk.

923
01:29:58,287 --> 01:29:59,413
Hurry!

924
01:30:01,373 --> 01:30:02,541
Circle.

925
01:30:04,293 --> 01:30:05,335
Eyes.

926
01:30:06,712 --> 01:30:08,922
Four eyes. North, south.

927
01:30:09,715 --> 01:30:12,176
Hurry! Oh, God, please.

928
01:30:12,885 --> 01:30:14,219
What's next?

929
01:30:18,474 --> 01:30:19,516
Hair.

930
01:30:29,860 --> 01:30:31,236
My child...

931
01:30:32,154 --> 01:30:34,239
I believe you broke my legs.

932
01:30:37,117 --> 01:30:38,786
You can't touch me.

933
01:30:39,328 --> 01:30:44,249
You can't get near me. See this?
This is your spell of protection.

934
01:30:44,750 --> 01:30:46,710
Is that what that is now?

935
01:30:48,045 --> 01:30:50,923
And who exactly gave you that spell?

936
01:30:51,423 --> 01:30:54,218
All that circle protects is you...

937
01:30:55,386 --> 01:30:56,762
from leaving it.

938
01:31:03,435 --> 01:31:04,937
You stay back!

939
01:31:05,104 --> 01:31:07,022
I'll kill you! You stay away!

940
01:31:07,439 --> 01:31:09,983
We've been waiting for you, Caroline.

941
01:31:10,275 --> 01:31:12,403
Waiting for you to believe.

942
01:31:13,112 --> 01:31:15,614
It doesn't work if you don't believe.

943
01:31:18,117 --> 01:31:20,160
<i>It is time, Lord.</i>

944
01:31:20,285 --> 01:31:22,830
<i>From the dry dust out of these chains.</i>

945
01:31:22,955 --> 01:31:24,748
I don't believe.

946
01:31:26,792 --> 01:31:28,001
I don't.

947
01:31:31,296 --> 01:31:32,798
I think you do.

948
01:31:32,965 --> 01:31:37,511
The weakness is the flesh.
The flesh, the flesh.

949
01:31:37,636 --> 01:31:39,930
I don't believe.

950
01:31:42,057 --> 01:31:43,308
I don't...

951
01:31:46,145 --> 01:31:48,022
I don't believe in it.

952
01:31:56,822 --> 01:31:59,116
The flesh. The coil.

953
01:31:59,241 --> 01:32:00,451
I don't believe.

954
01:32:00,576 --> 01:32:02,703
The frail. The weak.

955
01:32:03,328 --> 01:32:04,830
I don't believe.

956
01:32:06,915 --> 01:32:08,042
I don't...

957
01:32:09,168 --> 01:32:10,419
No.

958
01:32:13,088 --> 01:32:14,423
Oh, my God.

959
01:32:19,928 --> 01:32:21,513
I don't believe!

960
01:32:23,682 --> 01:32:25,309
I don't believe!

961
01:32:25,934 --> 01:32:27,519
I don't believe!

962
01:32:28,103 --> 01:32:29,605
I don't believe!

963
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,193
Thank you, child.

964
01:34:08,287 --> 01:34:09,538
Cecile?

965
01:34:10,789 --> 01:34:12,332
You all right?

966
01:34:14,043 --> 01:34:15,878
I'm fine now, Justify.

967
01:34:18,964 --> 01:34:21,050
A fair bit harder than the lawyer,
wasn't she?

968
01:34:21,133 --> 01:34:23,010
It's harder every time.

969
01:34:23,886 --> 01:34:26,346
They just don't believe like they used to.

970
01:34:26,472 --> 01:34:28,140
Got to get them riled up.

971
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:36,315
I told you I wanted a black one this time.

972
01:34:36,732 --> 01:34:38,942
You know the black ones never stay.

973
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:42,363
Beggars can't be choosers.

974
01:34:43,322 --> 01:34:45,699
I think it fits you beautifully.

975
01:34:46,408 --> 01:34:49,495
It's better than Violet, or Grace, even.

976
01:34:51,830 --> 01:34:54,958
We'll get used to it. We always do.

977
01:35:10,182 --> 01:35:13,310
The thing folks don't understand
about sacrifice...

978
01:35:15,104 --> 01:35:16,855
Get me out of here.

979
01:35:18,357 --> 01:35:20,359
...sometimes it's more of a trade.

980
01:35:20,526 --> 01:35:22,194
Get me out of here.

981
01:35:24,697 --> 01:35:26,615
No!

982
01:35:26,699 --> 01:35:28,575
There, there, Caroline.

983
01:35:41,797 --> 01:35:46,176
We thought it was just a fall, but
now she can't move or even speak.

984
01:35:46,552 --> 01:35:47,928
Like a stroke or something.

985
01:35:48,053 --> 01:35:49,179
Cary?

986
01:35:50,305 --> 01:35:51,807
Dearie me.

987
01:35:55,477 --> 01:35:56,770
You called me.

988
01:35:56,895 --> 01:35:58,313
I called you?

989
01:36:01,316 --> 01:36:03,527
For help. Don't you remember?

990
01:36:04,486 --> 01:36:07,573
Cary's not herself right now.
I'm Luke Marshall.

991
01:36:08,240 --> 01:36:11,493
- Devereauxs' lawyer.
- Hi. Jill Dupay, her roommate.

992
01:36:11,910 --> 01:36:14,121
Jill, yes, I did call you.

993
01:36:14,830 --> 01:36:17,499
Fiddlesticks.
I don't know what possessed me.

994
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,419
It's all right. I'm here.

995
01:36:22,171 --> 01:36:24,089
They need real care now.

996
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,425
They can't stay here.

997
01:36:26,592 --> 01:36:28,343
This is all my fault.

998
01:36:28,427 --> 01:36:30,137
No, Cary. No, it's not.

999
01:36:31,096 --> 01:36:32,306
It's not.

1000
01:36:42,858 --> 01:36:46,320
Someone should ride
to the hospital with them. Maybe...

1001
01:36:47,112 --> 01:36:50,741
Jill, would you mind? And we'll meet you.

1002
01:36:52,701 --> 01:36:54,620
Of course. Whatever you need.

1003
01:37:01,960 --> 01:37:05,547
She meant so much to them, her being here.

1004
01:37:06,882 --> 01:37:09,009
I know it wasn't for long, but...

1005
01:37:10,552 --> 01:37:12,137
they really loved her.

1006
01:37:13,305 --> 01:37:14,848
Why do you say that?

1007
01:37:20,145 --> 01:37:21,814
It's in their wills.

1008
01:37:22,648 --> 01:37:24,566
They left her the house.
