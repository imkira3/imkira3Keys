But not to find the Hammer,

We have to stop Szorlok.

- Hammerhead?

going to give another piece

to Szorlok before you bow out?

Just walk away, we'll take it from here.

Hammerhead hired them
because we keep failing.

We take the Darkspore to Hammerhead

and we get a big sack of god.

we hand over the Darkspore

to that snake of an innkeeper for money?

- Go on.

633
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:34,585
- He's more likely to sell it to Szorlok

634
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:36,166
than to hide it from him.

635
00:38:36,166 --> 00:38:38,353

636
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:40,342
the Darkspore for the Iron Crown.

637
00:38:40,342 --> 00:38:41,725
- The Iron Crown.

638
00:38:41,725 --> 00:38:43,724
- The Iron Crown that would
make him king of the dwarves.

639
00:38:43,724 --> 00:38:45,047
- Well that's very lovely for Hammerhead,

640
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:46,711
but I don't see what it has
to do with the Darkspore.

641
00:38:46,711 --> 00:38:48,588
- When the Golgotians
conquered and scattered

642
00:38:48,588 --> 00:38:50,745
- the dwarves centuries ago.
- [Dagen} Golgotians?

643
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,910
- They captured the Iron Crown.

644
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:53,668
- Golgotians are Szorlok's people.

645
00:38:53,668 --> 00:38:56,185
- No, not his people, allies.

646
00:38:56,185 --> 00:38:57,028
- Oh.

647
00:38:57,028 --> 00:38:59,066
- But in any case,

648
00:38:59,066 --> 00:39:00,711
Szorlok may have the Iron Crown.

649
00:39:00,711 --> 00:39:02,992
- You think Szorlok want's
to be king of the dwarves?

650
00:39:02,992 --> 00:39:04,850
- Dagen, let me finish.

651
00:39:05,901 --> 00:39:07,096
There's a legendary hammer.

652
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:08,291
The Hammer of Tek.

653
00:39:08,291 --> 00:39:10,190
- The Hammer that forged the world?

654
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,049
- Legend has it that the Hammer of Tek

655
00:39:13,049 --> 00:39:15,268
cannot be held by any mortal hands,

656
00:39:15,268 --> 00:39:17,657
except one who wears the Iron Crown.

657
00:39:17,657 --> 00:39:18,895
- It's a wonderful children's story.

658
00:39:18,895 --> 00:39:20,655
- Yes, well assuming that it's real,

659
00:39:20,655 --> 00:39:22,009
Tek's Hammer could destroy anything.

660
00:39:22,009 --> 00:39:23,172
Which includes the Darkspore,

661
00:39:23,172 --> 00:39:25,529
so maybe Hammerhead wants
to get the Iron Crown

662
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,492
so that he can get the Hammer,

663
00:39:27,492 --> 00:39:29,177
and destroy the Darkspore
for once and for all.

664
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:31,738
Which on all accounts,
is a very real plan.

665
00:39:31,738 --> 00:39:33,082
No more running and hiding.

666
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:34,309
- You're talking about
handing over the last piece

667
00:39:34,309 --> 00:39:35,578
of the Darkspore.

668
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:38,458
Now unless I'm mistaken, that
makes Szorlok the Lich King.

669
00:39:38,458 --> 00:39:40,774

me of that one time.

1004
01:02:42,959 --> 01:02:44,443
- How do you use it?

1005
01:02:44,443 --> 01:02:47,804
- You don't, it uses you.

1006
01:02:47,804 --> 01:02:50,150
It's a piece of the Lich Kings heart,

1007
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,361
and it's power can only
be used by a necromancer.

1008
01:02:53,361 --> 01:02:55,025
Like me.

1009
01:02:55,025 --> 01:02:57,546
- Hammerhead's no necromancer.

1010
01:02:57,546 --> 01:02:59,381
- He'll trade it to a necromancer,

1011
01:02:59,381 --> 01:03:02,271
for the Iron Crown of the Dwarves.

1012
01:03:03,141 --> 01:03:06,183
- I've known Hammerhead a
long time, he's no fool.

1013
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,137
- He's no fool,

1014
01:03:09,907 --> 01:03:12,451
but he may not believe there's
any way to stop Szorlok,

1015
01:03:12,451 --> 01:03:15,332
so he'll profit any way he can.

1016
01:03:15,332 --> 01:03:19,152
- Yes, that is his way.

1017
01:03:19,152 --> 01:03:21,146
- Know this.

1018
01:03:21,146 --> 01:03:25,264
The Darkspore is a
weapon with one purpose.

1019
01:03:25,264 --> 01:03:26,906
Death.

1020
01:03:26,906 --> 01:03:29,510
If Szorlok gets that last piece,

1021
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,346
nothing will matter.

1022
01:03:31,346 --> 01:03:35,037

1026
01:03:42,951 --> 01:03:45,833
- We can't let Szorlok get the Darkspore.

1027

We're all responsible for it.

Hammerhead's ways may not
be in line with yours,

01:03:57,770 --> 01:04:00,353
but what would you do that's any better?

1033
01:04:00,353 --> 01:04:02,678
- We're taking it to a
temple to keep it safe.

1034
01:04:02,678 --> 01:04:06,049
Anything's better than
letting Szorlok have it.

he was stuck down at the
hill known as Battlegrave.
