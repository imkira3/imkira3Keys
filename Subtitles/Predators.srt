1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:02:58,846 --> 00:02:59,846
Don't.

3
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:02,098
Calm down.

4
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,683
Hey, fuck you.

5
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,685
Calm down.

6
00:03:05,978 --> 00:03:07,603
Fuck you.

7
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:23,953
Looks like
his chute didn't open.

8
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,350
Single shooter.

9
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,561
How do you know?

10
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,545
Please stop doing that.

11
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:23,179
You're shooting at
the wrong people.

12
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,515
How do I know?

13
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:31,520
Because otherwise,
we wouldn't be having
this conversation.

14
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:42,865
All right.

15
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,076
You wanna show me
the right ones?

16
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,207
Nikolai.

17
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,542
I mean, l'm Nikolai.

18
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,383
What's the last thing
you remember, Nikolai?

19
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,595
War. Yeah.

20
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,138
I was with the Chechnya.

21
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:09,558
And there was a light.

22
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,895
And then I. . .
Then I woke up
and I was. . .

23
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,563
Falling.

24
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:18,567
Yeah, same thing.
I was in Baja.

25
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,569
And then
there was a light.

26
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,780
And then ch ingao.

27
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,499
Where are we?

28
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,586
Maybe she knows.

29
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,090
Shit.

30
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,597
You wanna
lower the weapon?

31
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,269
I've never seen
this jungle.

32
00:05:53,937 --> 00:05:55,938
And I've seen most.

33
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,275
All right, you think
this is Asia?

34
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:00,860
Maybe Africa?

35
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,320
Too hot for
this time of year.

36
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:05,781
And the topography
is all wrong.

37
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,451
Amazon, maybe.

38
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:10,953
I saw more parachutes.

39
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,539
Which way?

40
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,291
Why?

41
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:24,050
So I can figure out
who threw me out of
a fucking airplane.

42
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,310
Fuck.
Where's he going?

43
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:40,316
All right, let's hit
the fucking road.

44
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,077
Fuck.

45
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,624
You remember a plane?

46
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,504
I woke up in freefall.

47
00:07:43,755 --> 00:07:45,381
You?

48
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,883
Same.

49
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:51,262
You're IDF?

50
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:52,638
Yeah.

51
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,723
Are you in
the service?

52
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,059
Not exactly.

53
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,229
You motherfucker.

54
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:02,982
Come on,
you motherfucker.

55
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:21,834
You with him?

56
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,960
No.

57
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,135
Then why don't you mind
your own fucking business?

58
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:34,513
We have
bigger problems
right now.

59
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:38,809
Okay, boss.
Whatever you say.

60
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:45,232
I will finish
what you started.

61
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:53,449
Strength in numbers, huh?

62
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,367
Something like that.

63
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,452
Yeah?

64
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,288
Maybe we should
get that guy
hanging in the tree?

65
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,790
Help me!

66
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,334
Fuck!

67
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:06,795
Help me! Somebody!

68
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,549
Fuck. Help!

69
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
Hello?

70
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:16,931
I'm trapped in a parachute
in a fucking tree.

71
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,599
Hey, man,
why don't you
shut the fuck up?

72
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,643
Oh. Thank God.

73
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,311
I think I can. . .

74
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,480
Stop moving.
You're breaking
the branch.

75
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,191
You have anything
to cut yourself
down with?

76
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,026
Why would I. . .
No, I don't.

77
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,111
Look, if we get rope
from one of the chutes. . .

78
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:32,321
Do something.

79
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:39,286
Help!

80
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:40,913
It was taking too long.

81
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,665
Help!

82
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,464
Who the hell are you?

83
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:53,008
I'm a doctor.

84
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,761
I was on
my way to work.

85
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,266
Can someone please
just tell me, uh,

86
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:05,062
what the fuck
is going on here?

87
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:37,052
Your ass is awesome.

88
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:48,605
Look.

89
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:58,157
Goddamn.
Who the hell
is this guy?

90
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,717
What the hell
is that?

91
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,104
Who would do this?

92
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:33,067
Whoever they are,
they take trophies.

93
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,111
In my culture

94
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,489
the warrior with
the greatest trophies

95
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,115
commands
the most respect.

96
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:42,242
Whatever.

97
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:45,996
It's a test.

98
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,917
To see how we do
under pressure.

99
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:53,879
If this were a test,
you'd all be military.

100
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,255
Total strangers.

101
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,091
Live rounds.

102
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,760
This is something else.

103
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,762
Maybe it's ransom.

104
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:06,100
Back in Tijuana,
we kidnap you,

105
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,435
put you in
an oil drum.

106
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,105
The ransom's not paid,

107
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:14,149
we light you on fire.

108
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:16,402
I hear these stories

109
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:18,862
about these experiments
they run on cons.

110
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,280
They stick drugs
in your food

111
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:22,324
and they sit back
and watch what happens.

112
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,076
Well, it's not drugs.

113
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:26,537
If it was
a psychotropic compound,

114
00:12:26,621 --> 00:12:28,330
we'd be feeling
the residual side effects.

115
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:32,167
Loss of motor skills,
blurry vision.

116
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,797
And if it was
a behavioral experiment. . .
I mean, there. . .

117
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,340
There'd be a point.

118
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:43,220
What if we are dead?

119
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,937
I was going to be
executed in two days.

120
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,772
And I was in combat.

121
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,859
So was I.

122
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,611
This is hell.

123
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,739
Last time I looked,
you didn't need
a parachute to get there.

124
00:13:04,284 --> 00:13:06,535
It doesn't matter
what happened, or why.

125
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:08,829
We're here.

126
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,542
Only question is,
how do we get out?

127
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,464
Where you going?

128
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,340
To high ground.

129
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,050
We need to
stick together.

130
00:13:24,387 --> 00:13:26,889
Then you should
follow me.

131
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,553
Uh, yeah,
I wouldn't do that.

132
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:15,729
Yep.

133
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,441
Archaefructus
liaoningensis.

134
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,611
That is really,
really poisonous.

135
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,780
Wouldn't take more
than one scratch

136
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,990
to cause
total paralysis.

137
00:14:30,245 --> 00:14:34,289
Thank you.
I'll watch for you
out here.

138
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,294
You made a buddy.

139
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,596
Hey.

140
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,558
We need to rest.

141
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:55,644
So rest.

142
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,314
You look like
you could use it, too.

143
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,819
You got a name?

144
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,533
Look.

145
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,911
I'm sorry.
You want to play
scout leader, great.

146
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,706
All right? You wanna
follow me, fine.

147
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:17,791
But I'm not doing this.

148
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,460
I'm better on my own.

149
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,214
Wanna see
something fucked up?

150
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,655
Well, between that
and the sun,

151
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,783
I'd say we have
a real problem.

152
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,619
What about the sun?

153
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:56,997
Hasn't moved
since we got here.

154
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,089
What do you think
is really going on?

155
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,553
What do I think?

156
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,266
Spetsnaz.

157
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:18,101
Alpha Group.

158
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:21,271
Los Zetas,
cartel enforcer.

159
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:23,649
RUF.

160
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:26,318
It's a death squad
from Sierra Leone.

161
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,779
Yakuza, Inagawa-kai.

162
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,948
And the FBI's
Most Wanted.

163
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,160
And him.

164
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,748
They're all
heavy-hitters.
He doesn't belong.

165
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,334
Belong to what?

166
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,839
I'd say we were chosen.

167
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:54,971
What about you?

168
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,100
What about me?

169
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:05,023
You know the jungle.
Know the players.

170
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:10,028
I'm guessing ex-military.
Black ops.

171
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:12,906
Probably a mercenary.

172
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,991
You got a problem
with that?

173
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:20,580
Not at the moment.

174
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,875
Good.

175
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,355
Something was
dropped here.

176
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,233
Same as us.

177
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:14,861
Not the same as us.

178
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,620
You said
we were chosen.

179
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,874
Chosen for what?

180
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,295
Oh, shit.

181
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,706
Looking good there, boss.

182
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,505
Look out!

183
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,673
Down !

184
00:20:20,136 --> 00:20:21,511
Shit!

185
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:42,741
Help!

186
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:43,825
Shit.

187
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,962
Damn it.

188
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,577
12 o'clock.
110 meters.

189
00:21:27,662 --> 00:21:29,496
Take him. Take him.

190
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,331
I don't have to.

191
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:36,044
Don't have to.

192
00:21:43,177 --> 00:21:45,679
We triggered
a dead man's trap.

193
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:52,936
It's two weeks, judging from
the rate of decomposition.

194
00:21:54,063 --> 00:21:55,563
He took up
a position here.

195
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,736
Shooting in all directions.

196
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,406
This was a last stand.

197
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:14,290
United States
Special Forces.

198
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,543
This is strange.

199
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,588
He is supposed
to be deployed
in Afghanistan.

200
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:23,425
What's he doing here,
setting traps for us?

201
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:25,802
They weren't meant for us.

202
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:29,097
He was hunting
something else.

203
00:22:29,432 --> 00:22:31,016
Something a lot bigger.

204
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,892
Bigger?

205
00:22:33,978 --> 00:22:35,854
The trunk was a deadfall.

206
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,397
Rule of thumb
with a deadfall

207
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:40,483
is you set the weight
five times that of
the target animal.

208
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:43,945
Whatever it was,
it got through
the trip wires.

209
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,780
And it did this.

210
00:22:51,162 --> 00:22:52,912
Let's move.

211
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:15,852
What is it?

212
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,314
What is it?

213
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,365
Nothing.

214
00:23:40,211 --> 00:23:44,339
What is it?
Nothing. Nothing.

215
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,965
Nothing.

216
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,204
We're gonna need
a new plan.

217
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,642
Hey, where are we going?

218
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:22,020
Someone put us
on this rock.

219
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:24,522
There's got to be
a way off it.

220
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,734
What the fuck?

221
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,200
You know what?
Fuck this.

222
00:25:35,284 --> 00:25:36,993
This is bullshit, man.

223
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,620
I want a gun.

224
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,331
Come on, man,
you got two
motherfucking guns, man.

225
00:25:41,415 --> 00:25:43,124
Somebody give me a gun.

226
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:47,921
Come on, Russian.
You got a big fucking gun.

227
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,259
Come on, man.

228
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,720
Give me a gun.

229
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:58,765
Give me your gun.
Right now.

230
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:02,101
Give me your gun.

231
00:26:08,651 --> 00:26:10,818
I'm ready to die.

232
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,155
Are you?

233
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,604
Oh.

234
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,237
Help!

235
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:47,749
Oh, shit!

236
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,168
Oh.

237
00:27:51,045 --> 00:27:52,211
Shit! Fuck!

238
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,106
Help!

239
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:17,945
Fuck you ! Fuck you !

240
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,371
Looking good there, boss.

241
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:42,720
Go! Go!

242
00:28:42,805 --> 00:28:44,639
Come on. Come on.

243
00:28:54,066 --> 00:28:55,483
Oh, shit!

244
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:05,535
Come on !

245
00:29:08,664 --> 00:29:09,705
No!

246
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,030
As bad as you are,

247
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:46,492
those things are worse.

248
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,889
So they. . .
They just,
what, left?

249
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,183
No.

250
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,018
The whistle.

251
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,228
They were called.

252
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,647
All right, listen up.

253
00:30:16,732 --> 00:30:18,941
Everybody do
a shell count.

254
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:21,486
We got to
conserve ammunition.

255
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:24,405
Reload. Do it now.

256
00:30:24,907 --> 00:30:28,493
Excuse me.
Just what the hell
is going on here?

257
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,287
We're being hunted.

258
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:38,211
The cages.
The soldier.
All of us.

259
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:42,423
All brought here
for the same purpose.

260
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,802
This planet is
a game preserve.

261
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:49,388
And we're the game.

262
00:30:53,143 --> 00:30:55,436
In case you didn't notice,

263
00:30:55,521 --> 00:30:58,231
we just got flushed out.

264
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,817
They sent the dogs in,

265
00:31:01,902 --> 00:31:04,612
just like you would
if you were stalking boar

266
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,947
or shooting quail.

267
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:09,450
They split us apart
and they watched.

268
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,618
Testing us.

269
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,126
How do you know this?

270
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,796
Because

271
00:31:22,506 --> 00:31:24,340
that's what I would do.

272
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,386
Fantastic.

273
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:30,471
Wait.

274
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:34,183
There are only
seven of us.

275
00:31:34,810 --> 00:31:37,353
Help me!

276
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,990
Help!

277
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,310
Help.

278
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,732
Wait.
What?

279
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:25,943
It's a trap.

280
00:32:35,746 --> 00:32:38,164
Help me.

281
00:32:52,596 --> 00:32:53,888
Fuck me.

282
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,266
Help.

283
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,730
Wound one man.

284
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,151
Make him suffer.

285
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:10,404
Make him bleed.

286
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:15,159
Make him
call out for help,

287
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:18,996
and set a trap
and kill those
who come.

288
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,378
I know because
I have done this.

289
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,174
So we're gonna
leave him here,
right?

290
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,929
Come on,
look at him.
He's done.

291
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:39,058
There's nothing else
we can do, right?

292
00:33:39,142 --> 00:33:40,643
Right?

293
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,568
We leave him.

294
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,655
I can't.

295
00:33:53,657 --> 00:33:55,658
Then, that's on you.

296
00:34:12,092 --> 00:34:15,177
Help me.

297
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:41,620
Help me.

298
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,799
Help me. Help me.

299
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:56,260
It's a trap. It's a trap.
It's a trap.

300
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,408
What are we gonna do?

301
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:23,037
We should go to
higher ground.

302
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,497
Really?

303
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,791
We're trapped on
an alien hunting planet.

304
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:30,002
You really think
the solution is
to walk more?

305
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,383
It wants us to run.

306
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,387
That's how it hunts.

307
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,185
This is its jungle.

308
00:35:47,187 --> 00:35:49,021
Its game.

309
00:35:50,232 --> 00:35:52,066
Its rules.

310
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,070
We run,

311
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,031
we die.

312
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,077
What's
the alternative?

313
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:06,997
We need to know
who we're dealing with.

314
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,668
Dog tracks go that way.

315
00:36:13,213 --> 00:36:15,214
We go after it.

316
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,859
Well?

317
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,778
No movement.

318
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:17,151
It looks like
we're not the only
things being hunted.

319
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:44,298
Holy shit!

320
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:46,675
What the fuck?

321
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,427
What the fuck
is that thing?

322
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:52,473
This is a mistake.
We have to leave. Now.

323
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,267
Where is
the tough guy?

324
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,648
He left us.

325
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,902
He's here.

326
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:24,880
Run!

327
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,840
Run ! Run ! Run !

328
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,828
You set us up.

329
00:43:03,456 --> 00:43:05,832
He led us into
that death camp,

330
00:43:05,917 --> 00:43:08,502
then hid and waited
for that thing to strike.

331
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,004
We were bait.

332
00:43:12,507 --> 00:43:15,175
I needed to know
who we were up against.

333
00:43:16,344 --> 00:43:17,511
Now I do.

334
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,846
A man is dead
because of that.

335
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:23,350
This morning you were
ready to kill him.

336
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,019
It ain't this
goddamn morning, is it?

337
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,938
At least he didn't
die in vain.

338
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:30,148
Why? So we could
find out firsthand

339
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:32,734
what it feels like
to have our asses kicked?

340
00:43:32,819 --> 00:43:35,445
No. We found out
that there's more
than one of them.

341
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,407
That they use projectile
and energy-based weapons.

342
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:40,617
That they have some sort
of cloaking device.

343
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,536
That they're bigger than us,

344
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,372
stronger,
but also heavier.

345
00:43:47,709 --> 00:43:50,377
You put us at risk
for yourself.

346
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,046
You want to be
on your own,

347
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,881
you got it.

348
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,050
Why don't you tell
them the truth?

349
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,802
I don't know what
you're talking about.

350
00:43:58,886 --> 00:43:59,886
You know what
I'm talking about.

351
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:01,722
The way you
looked at that thing
that was strung up,

352
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:04,099
the way you reacted.

353
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:08,812
She knows what it is.
Don't you?

354
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,000
We don't have
a name for them.

355
00:44:35,131 --> 00:44:37,507
'87, Guatemala.

356
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:43,013
A spec ops team
went into the jungle.

357
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,598
High end.

358
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,476
Six men plus
a CIA liaison.

359
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:50,228
Only one made it out.

360
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:53,106
In his debrief,

361
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:56,151
he said
they came in contact
with something.

362
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,737
He gave a detailed
description.

363
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:02,407
The thing
on the totem.

364
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:09,373
It wore some kind of
camouflage that adjusted
to ambient light.

365
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:12,334
Made it nearly invisible
in our spectrum.

366
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:15,837
It could see
in infrared.

367
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:18,048
Heat signatures.

368
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,259
He used mud
to block his.

369
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,512
That's how
he beat it.

370
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,226
It hunted and
killed his team,

371
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,314
one by one.

372
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,860
Whatever it is,

373
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:42,072
wherever they're from,

374
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:46,118
we're going to
kill them all.

375
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,621
We set up
a defensive perimeter.

376
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,998
Make it look like
we are holing up.

377
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:53,917
That'll bring them to us.

378
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,503
We force them into
a choke point.

379
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:59,464
We get them in
overlapping fields
of fire.

380
00:46:00,341 --> 00:46:01,800
It can be done.

381
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:06,346
I can't do it alone.

382
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:44,676
You know, man,
if we ever
make it home,

383
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:48,180
I'm gonna do so much
fucking cocaine.

384
00:46:49,474 --> 00:46:51,850
I'm gonna rape
so many fine bitches.

385
00:46:53,436 --> 00:46:55,979
I'll be like,
"What time is it?
5:00?

386
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,148
"Damn.

387
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:01,067
"Time to go rape me
some fine bitches."

388
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:02,444
You know what
I'm saying?

389
00:47:02,612 --> 00:47:04,821
Oh, yeah. Totally.

390
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:07,574
Like, 5:00,

391
00:47:08,743 --> 00:47:10,494
it's bitch-raping time.

392
00:47:10,912 --> 00:47:11,953
Mmm.

393
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:13,330
Yeah.

394
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:24,966
You should
stay away from him.
Yeah.

395
00:47:36,646 --> 00:47:37,896
You still pissed?

396
00:47:39,023 --> 00:47:40,440
Fuck you.

397
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:56,122
You know what the difference
between you and me is?

398
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,210
We both do
the same thing.

399
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:01,878
You just do it
for a country,

400
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,381
so you don't
have to admit
you like it.

401
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,385
What happened to you?

402
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,637
What made you
so fucked up?

403
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,978
"There is no hunting
like the hunting of a man.

404
00:48:18,354 --> 00:48:21,398
"And those who've hunted
armed men long enough,

405
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:23,984
"and like it,

406
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:27,153
"never really care
for anything else
thereafter."

407
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,158
That's pretty poetic.

408
00:48:33,703 --> 00:48:36,496
Did you come up with
that all by yourself?

409
00:48:36,581 --> 00:48:38,582
No, actually.

410
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:42,168
That was Hemingway.

411
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:21,291
Fuck.

412
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:25,712
Why isn't it coming?

413
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:31,134
They see our traps.

414
00:49:48,444 --> 00:49:49,819
Hey, Doc.

415
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:51,529
Hey.

416
00:49:51,614 --> 00:49:55,075
I think I just
figured out a way
you can be useful.

417
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,628
Shit. Shit.

418
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:10,382
I hate this.
I hate this.
I hate this.

419
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,758
Oh!

420
00:50:16,806 --> 00:50:18,682
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

421
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,227
Oh, shit!

422
00:50:22,311 --> 00:50:23,436
Come on. Come on.

423
00:50:23,521 --> 00:50:25,271
Fucking shoot!

424
00:50:26,774 --> 00:50:27,941
Shoot already!

425
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,453
Fuck

426
00:50:41,664 --> 00:50:43,665
all of you !

427
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:56,302
Is he dead? Why ain't
you smiling? Oh, shit.

428
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,805
The thing
from the cages.

429
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,725
Maybe it thought
we're the ones
who dropped it here.

430
00:51:06,814 --> 00:51:08,690
Good shot, though.

431
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:13,153
I missed.

432
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,371
(WHISPERING)
Over here.

433
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:29,252
Over here.

434
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,553
Over here.

435
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,561
Turn around.

436
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:00,366
What the fuck are you?

437
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,379
I'm alive.

438
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,764
You talk too loud.

439
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:32,482
Smelled you
since you got here.

440
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:36,986
If I can smell you,

441
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:39,239
if I can hear you,

442
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:41,825
they can, too.

443
00:52:46,914 --> 00:52:49,833
Storm coming soon.
This way.

444
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,460
Wait.

445
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:56,756
Who are you?

446
00:52:58,926 --> 00:53:01,344
Noland,

447
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,847
run away,

448
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,975
live to fight
another day.

449
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:13,523
I'm the one
that got away.

450
00:53:15,526 --> 00:53:17,777
The one you
don't fuck with.

451
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:47,659
Come on.

452
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:50,244
Feel the vibe
of this place.

453
00:55:05,052 --> 00:55:06,302
Where are we?

454
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:09,389
It's a drill
somebody left behind.

455
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:14,018
The machine is dead,
but the power source ain't.

456
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,375
Wow,
what a shithole.

457
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:20,710
You live here?

458
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:25,590
Oh, no. No.
This is my summer home.

459
00:56:25,674 --> 00:56:27,842
I winter in the Riviera.

460
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:31,054
The schools are
so much nicer there.

461
00:56:31,138 --> 00:56:32,346
And the men. . .

462
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:34,348
Ooh, la, la!

463
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,352
By the way,
you're welcome.

464
00:56:39,021 --> 00:56:41,355
How have you survived?

465
00:56:46,153 --> 00:56:50,239
Salvaging what I can,
when I can,

466
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:53,326
from whatever I can.

467
00:56:55,287 --> 00:56:56,412
Oh.

468
00:56:57,956 --> 00:57:00,416
Noland, Ronald.

469
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:02,919
Air Cav.

470
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:04,921
They. . . (CHUCKLING)

471
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:06,798
They drop you
all in, too?

472
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:09,634
Yeah.

473
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,886
Hmm. (CHUCKLING)

474
00:57:12,638 --> 00:57:14,388
What a rush.

475
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:24,148
Hey.

476
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:25,942
Yeah, I'll tell him.

477
00:57:26,026 --> 00:57:30,696
Hey, Agent Orange,
you wanna put that down?

478
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:31,948
Certain people
around here

479
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,157
are particular
about other people

480
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:34,367
messing with their shit.

481
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,453
Very important, though.

482
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:40,957
Disrupts the
heat signature.

483
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:42,834
You motherfuckers.

484
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,380
So, you killed one?

485
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:49,215
Uh-uh.

486
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,384
I killed two.

487
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:54,220
Maybe three.

488
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:57,557
I can't remember. Anyway,

489
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,186
there's two different types
of them out there.

490
00:58:02,271 --> 00:58:04,856
Hmm? Now they're similar,
but they're different.

491
00:58:04,940 --> 00:58:07,775
It's kind of like
the difference between
dogs and wolves.

492
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:11,154
The ones that
are running things
up there,

493
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,990
the larger ones,
hunt the smaller ones.

494
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:16,993
It's some kind of
blood feud, I guess.

495
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:19,453
Been going on
for a long time.

496
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:23,499
They do this
just for sport?

497
00:58:23,584 --> 00:58:27,587
Oh, yeah,
they bring in fresh meat
season after season.

498
00:58:27,671 --> 00:58:30,173
I mean, shit you
wouldn't believe.

499
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,842
Bring it in,

500
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:37,221
and hunt it
and kill it.
In that order.

501
00:58:39,308 --> 00:58:41,475
How long you
been here, man?

502
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:43,936
Uh. . .

503
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,107
Seven seasons, I think.

504
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:51,194
What? Ten?

505
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,112
Damn.

506
00:58:53,197 --> 00:58:57,116
Anyway, every once
in a while, one of us
kills one of them.

507
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,704
And, let me tell you,
that's when they get
real interested.

508
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,958
See, they learn quick.
They adapt.

509
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,921
They develop
a whole new set
of skills.

510
00:59:10,005 --> 00:59:14,800
They come back
the next season in threes,
always in threes.

511
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:16,928
Their armor
might've changed,

512
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:19,764
or their weapons
have changed,

513
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:22,141
or their tactics
have changed.

514
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:25,144
It's amazing.

515
00:59:25,729 --> 00:59:27,688
So, it's like evolution.

516
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:32,568
They're trying
to make themselves
into better killers.

517
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:34,320
Mmm-hmm.

518
00:59:35,322 --> 00:59:37,698
You said they come back.

519
00:59:39,868 --> 00:59:41,077
How?

520
00:59:41,370 --> 00:59:43,162
They got a ship.

521
00:59:43,497 --> 00:59:44,664
A ship?

522
00:59:44,748 --> 00:59:45,748
Yeah.

523
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:48,125
It's 30 yards
from their camp.

524
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,838
I told you
they wouldn't see it.

525
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,882
I told you
they wouldn't.

526
00:59:54,967 --> 00:59:56,092
You were there.

527
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,347
You could've helped us.

528
01:00:04,685 --> 01:00:06,727
How do we kill them?

529
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:10,856
However you can.

530
01:00:12,693 --> 01:00:14,026
They must have
a weakness.

531
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:17,571
Not many.

532
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:23,619
You want to survive?
You dig in deep.
You stay hid.

533
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,706
Yeah, well,
we're gonna go with
door number two.

534
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,708
How do we get out
of this valley?

535
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:30,251
Oh.

536
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:32,545
Ten seasons.

537
01:00:33,547 --> 01:00:35,881
First two seasons. . .
No, three seasons
I was here,

538
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,634
I was walking
in the same direction,

539
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:42,054
trying to reach
the edge of
the preserve.

540
01:00:47,269 --> 01:00:48,269
Let me tell you something,

541
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:50,980
there ain't no edge
of the preserve.

542
01:00:53,859 --> 01:00:57,028
Maybe you and your friend
wanna tell me about that ship?

543
01:00:59,323 --> 01:01:00,948
Let's see.

544
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:06,370
That's a brilliant idea.
Brilliant.

545
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:11,667
The whole time
I've been here,
it never occurred to me

546
01:01:11,752 --> 01:01:13,794
to commandeer
the alien spacecraft.

547
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:18,090
But I wouldn't know
how to fly it.

548
01:01:19,468 --> 01:01:21,052
He would.

549
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:23,387
Of course,
you know how to fly.

550
01:01:23,889 --> 01:01:25,681
I'll give it a shot.

551
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:30,811
Well. . .

552
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:34,482
I'm gonna get
some sleep.

553
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,069
No noise.
They're out there.

554
01:01:39,071 --> 01:01:41,072
They're always
out there.

555
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:45,659
Water in there.

556
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:50,915
Help yourself.
All of you.

557
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,773
Who's that?

558
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,734
My kids.

559
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:24,698
Big one, Ilya.
And that's Sascha.

560
01:02:31,248 --> 01:02:32,373
Uh. . .

561
01:02:34,501 --> 01:02:37,586
This is, uh, Candy Lee.

562
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:41,215
Tits like howitzers.

563
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,344
Is that your girlfriend?

564
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:49,098
No. It's my sister.

565
01:03:07,993 --> 01:03:10,327
This is old.

566
01:03:10,412 --> 01:03:12,538
Very old.

567
01:03:12,622 --> 01:03:15,583
They've been doing this
for a long time.

568
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:18,043
You speak English.

569
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:20,713
Yes.

570
01:03:21,673 --> 01:03:23,883
Why don't you
say more?

571
01:03:29,264 --> 01:03:31,390
Because I talk too much.

572
01:03:56,041 --> 01:03:57,458
Thanks.

573
01:04:09,638 --> 01:04:12,473
Do you know
what I was doing
when I was taken?

574
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,021
Isaac, my spotter.

575
01:04:19,898 --> 01:04:21,607
He was caught.

576
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:23,943
I could have
done something,

577
01:04:24,027 --> 01:04:26,153
but then I would have been
slaughtered along with him.

578
01:04:27,489 --> 01:04:29,240
So, I hid.

579
01:04:30,659 --> 01:04:32,660
I watched him die.

580
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:40,501
I wish I pulled
that trigger.

581
01:04:40,585 --> 01:04:43,087
You do what you have to,
to survive.

582
01:04:44,256 --> 01:04:46,632
You said we were chosen.

583
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,219
I asked, "For what?"

584
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,890
I should've asked why.

585
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,018
It's because
we are predators.

586
01:04:59,938 --> 01:05:01,105
Just like them.

587
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,442
We're the monsters
of our own world.

588
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,239
It's probably better
that we're never
going back.

589
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,116
I am going back.

590
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,123
I'm going
after that ship.

591
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:24,336
You learn how to
fly it in the last hour
and not tell me?

592
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,088
No.

593
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:29,758
That thing strung up
at the camp might know.

594
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:33,971
My guess is,
it'd do just about
anything to get free.

595
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,017
Enemy of my enemy.

596
01:05:38,435 --> 01:05:40,853
That doesn't
make it a friend.

597
01:05:46,318 --> 01:05:48,360
So what
do I call you?

598
01:05:55,535 --> 01:05:57,036
Smoke.

599
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,121
Hey, smoke.

600
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,457
Fuck.

601
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:08,964
Where's Noland?

602
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,719
He's a scavenger.

603
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,346
He wants what we have.

604
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,900
Come on !
There must be a way out!

605
01:06:30,362 --> 01:06:32,112
- Damn it.
- - Do it!

606
01:06:32,197 --> 01:06:34,073
You see the shit
you've gotten us
into, man?

607
01:06:35,075 --> 01:06:36,825
I told you that.
You never listen
to me, though.

608
01:06:37,243 --> 01:06:39,244
Six more. Six more fucking
mouths to feed.

609
01:06:40,038 --> 01:06:41,580
I can barely stand
living with you.

610
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,208
How am I gonna
live with them, too?

611
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,086
Damn it!

612
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,587
What?

613
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,714
Say goodbye to
your little friend.

614
01:06:53,093 --> 01:06:55,761
You're in my house,
motherfucker!

615
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,683
Get down.

616
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:08,565
Yeah, that didn't
open up shit.

617
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:11,819
Wasn't meant to, asshole.

618
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:13,946
I'm calling in
the cavalry.

619
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:23,956
How the fuck
can we get out of here?

620
01:07:26,710 --> 01:07:28,502
Open up,
you hanky fucker.

621
01:07:49,941 --> 01:07:51,483
Come on !

622
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,115
Oh.

623
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,617
Finally found me,
huh, big dog?

624
01:08:01,786 --> 01:08:04,747
Well, what took
you so long?

625
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,753
It's not gonna open !

626
01:08:12,672 --> 01:08:14,923
God damn it!

627
01:08:46,206 --> 01:08:47,664
It's toying with us.

628
01:10:28,975 --> 01:10:30,017
Guys?

629
01:10:30,935 --> 01:10:32,227
Oh, shit.

630
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,367
Hey!

631
01:11:34,874 --> 01:11:36,625
This way.

632
01:11:40,171 --> 01:11:44,216
Hey!

633
01:11:46,219 --> 01:11:48,261
I lost you guys!

634
01:11:52,058 --> 01:11:53,767
You got to get me
out of here, man.

635
01:11:54,060 --> 01:11:56,269
Come on. Come on.

636
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:58,730
Let's move.

637
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:28,510
Oh. . .

638
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:19,936
Oh !

639
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:30,590
We killed it.

640
01:14:31,759 --> 01:14:33,969
We killed it!
We fucking. . .

641
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:37,806
We fucking killed it.

642
01:14:37,890 --> 01:14:39,808
We killed it. Whoo!

643
01:14:39,892 --> 01:14:42,018
We fucking killed it.
Huh?

644
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:46,356
Who's your daddy now,
motherfucker?

645
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:47,899
Hunt my dick, bitch !

646
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,334
Die, you space faggot!

647
01:15:06,419 --> 01:15:08,003
Who do you think
you're dealing with, hoss?

648
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:09,337
Is that all you've got?

649
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:11,590
Go! Go!

650
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:24,853
Come on.

651
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,522
Come on !

652
01:16:02,391 --> 01:16:04,309
Let's get to
that ship.

653
01:19:27,638 --> 01:19:30,390
We're close. Come on.

654
01:19:31,976 --> 01:19:33,726
Ow! Shit!

655
01:19:35,688 --> 01:19:36,771
Shit.

656
01:19:42,194 --> 01:19:43,528
Fuck!

657
01:19:49,243 --> 01:19:52,245
Another inch,
it would've hit
my tibial artery.

658
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:53,997
I guess this
is my lucky day.

659
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:57,208
It isn't. That trap
wasn't meant to kill.

660
01:19:58,169 --> 01:19:59,544
It was meant to maim.

661
01:20:00,754 --> 01:20:02,255
He's dead weight.
Come on.

662
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:03,631
Uh, um. . .

663
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:07,635
No, I can still walk.

664
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:10,388
Oh ! !
Shit. God.

665
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:12,140
No, he can't. Look.

666
01:20:12,224 --> 01:20:14,100
He's done.

667
01:20:14,185 --> 01:20:15,935
You're gonna beg us
to slow down.

668
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,605
No, no, no.
To carry you.

669
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:23,359
You can't leave me here.

670
01:20:23,444 --> 01:20:26,196
You can't.
I have a family.

671
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,240
I got kids.

672
01:20:30,284 --> 01:20:31,367
I'm sorry.

673
01:20:34,163 --> 01:20:35,830
We need to go.

674
01:20:35,915 --> 01:20:37,290
No. No!

675
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,417
You are taking me
with you !

676
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:40,793
Look, you and I
can still make it.

677
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,837
We use him.

678
01:20:42,922 --> 01:20:44,422
We booby-trap him.

679
01:20:45,758 --> 01:20:46,799
No.

680
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,385
They'll go to him
to take trophies.

681
01:20:49,470 --> 01:20:51,429
This is our last chance.

682
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,556
This isn't right.
He's one of us!

683
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:54,641
He is.

684
01:20:54,725 --> 01:20:56,392
That's what
they're counting on.

685
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:59,020
They want you
to feel something
for this man.

686
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:00,730
To be human.

687
01:21:01,190 --> 01:21:03,358
And what are you?

688
01:21:04,485 --> 01:21:05,652
Alive.

689
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,906
What's that worth?

690
01:21:09,990 --> 01:21:11,950
You can't. Please.

691
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:13,785
Please,
I'm begging you.

692
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,537
Please.

693
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:16,746
You should go.

694
01:21:24,547 --> 01:21:25,964
Shit.

695
01:21:32,179 --> 01:21:34,180
You should've
gone with him.
I know.

696
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:02,667
Hey.

697
01:22:28,068 --> 01:22:30,528
I want off this planet.

698
01:22:33,532 --> 01:22:35,199
You understand me?

699
01:22:37,578 --> 01:22:39,871
I'll cut you down.

700
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,874
You take me
to the ship.

701
01:22:43,792 --> 01:22:45,209
Ship.

702
01:22:48,422 --> 01:22:50,798
You understand me,
don't you?

703
01:22:54,053 --> 01:22:55,178
Huh?

704
01:23:29,088 --> 01:23:30,380
I'm sorry.

705
01:23:30,464 --> 01:23:32,090
We're not dead yet.

706
01:23:35,010 --> 01:23:36,302
Shit.

707
01:27:21,111 --> 01:27:22,486
I guess he made it.

708
01:27:36,835 --> 01:27:39,253
If you could
do it over again,

709
01:27:40,756 --> 01:27:43,174
would you make
the same choice?

710
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,179
Yes.

711
01:28:02,361 --> 01:28:03,861
Thank you.

712
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:08,282
When the time comes,

713
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:11,202
I'll do us both.

714
01:28:12,663 --> 01:28:14,747
I promise
it'll be quick.

715
01:28:16,083 --> 01:28:17,083
No.

716
01:28:19,503 --> 01:28:21,837
It won't.

717
01:28:37,562 --> 01:28:38,813
Cool.

718
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:42,858
That's right.

719
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:46,237
It's a neurotoxin.

720
01:28:46,780 --> 01:28:48,698
There's so many
to choose from
around here.

721
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,575
But don't worry.
It's not fatal.

722
01:28:52,035 --> 01:28:55,329
You'll be able to
experience everything.

723
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:31,907
I guess now you realize
why they chose me.

724
01:29:33,452 --> 01:29:36,370
I was right in front of
you guys the whole time.

725
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:38,706
Just watching you.

726
01:29:39,833 --> 01:29:41,834
Earning your trust.

727
01:29:45,714 --> 01:29:48,466
You couldn't see me
for what I really am.

728
01:29:49,843 --> 01:29:51,886
You see, back home,

729
01:29:51,970 --> 01:29:53,888
I'm a murderer.

730
01:29:56,433 --> 01:29:57,808
I'm a freak.

731
01:29:59,269 --> 01:30:00,478
But here,

732
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:03,481
among the monsters,

733
01:30:07,402 --> 01:30:09,487
I'm normal.

734
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:12,323
I like it here.

735
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:14,784
I wanna stay.

736
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,557
Oh ! You came back.

737
01:30:39,434 --> 01:30:41,519
I missed my ride.

738
01:30:42,354 --> 01:30:44,146
Oh, thank God.

739
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:45,689
Help us get out of here.

740
01:31:06,211 --> 01:31:07,878
She's paralyzed.

741
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:11,465
It gave her something.
I don't know what,

742
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:13,801
but it paralyzed her.

743
01:31:17,681 --> 01:31:19,056
Come on.

744
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:40,578
You're so busy
taking care of others,

745
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,454
you forgot
to look out
for yourself.

746
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:45,916
We're getting
out of here.

747
01:31:46,001 --> 01:31:48,085
You just hang
tight, okay?

748
01:31:48,587 --> 01:31:50,379
I didn't think
you'd come back.

749
01:31:52,132 --> 01:31:54,008
But she,

750
01:31:54,092 --> 01:31:56,385
she never lost
faith in you.

751
01:31:57,304 --> 01:31:59,138
I guess I owe you
an apology.

752
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:03,767
You are a good man
after all.

753
01:32:05,437 --> 01:32:06,604
No.

754
01:32:07,439 --> 01:32:08,647
I'm not.

755
01:32:13,278 --> 01:32:14,820
But I'm fast.

756
01:32:30,378 --> 01:32:31,712
Come here.

757
01:32:36,885 --> 01:32:40,179
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me.

758
01:32:40,722 --> 01:32:42,056
I won't.

759
01:33:57,173 --> 01:33:58,674
Help me.

760
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:02,011
I'm one of you.

761
01:34:34,419 --> 01:34:35,502
Yes.

762
01:34:35,587 --> 01:34:37,921
Come on. Come on.

763
01:34:38,923 --> 01:34:41,633
Come on.
Come on. Do it.

764
01:34:42,385 --> 01:34:43,844
I'm here. Kill me.

765
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:47,681
Come on.

766
01:34:47,766 --> 01:34:49,266
Do it now. Kill me!

767
01:36:00,505 --> 01:36:01,547
Oh, shit.

768
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:56,930
Did you get it?

769
01:38:57,724 --> 01:38:59,057
Yeah.

770
01:39:12,155 --> 01:39:13,822
I'm Royce.

771
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:19,036
Nice to meet you, Royce.

772
01:39:21,372 --> 01:39:23,040
I'm Isabelle.

773
01:40:49,794 --> 01:40:51,128
Now,

774
01:40:52,171 --> 01:40:55,340
let's find a way off
this fucking planet.

775
01:41:18,823 --> 01:41:20,407
Don't tell Aunt Mary
about Uncle John

776
01:41:20,491 --> 01:41:22,784
He claims he has the music
But he has a lot of fun

777
01:41:22,869 --> 01:41:26,747
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

778
01:41:26,831 --> 01:41:32,544
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

779
01:41:32,628 --> 01:41:35,255
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet

780
01:41:35,339 --> 01:41:37,924
She's got everything
that Uncle John needs

781
01:41:38,009 --> 01:41:41,928
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

782
01:41:42,013 --> 01:41:47,768
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

783
01:41:47,852 --> 01:41:50,771
Well, I saw Uncle John
with bald-head Sally

784
01:41:50,855 --> 01:41:53,148
He saw Aunt Mary coming and
he ducked back in the alley

785
01:41:53,232 --> 01:41:57,152
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

786
01:41:57,236 --> 01:42:02,616
Oh, baby, having me
some fun tonight, yeah

787
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:03,825
Ahhh!

788
01:42:17,298 --> 01:42:20,091
Well, long, tall Sally
She's built sweet

789
01:42:20,176 --> 01:42:22,969
She's got everything
that Uncle John needs

790
01:42:23,054 --> 01:42:26,973
Oh, baby, yeah, baby

791
01:42:27,058 --> 01:42:31,770
Ooh, baby, having me
some fun tonight

792
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:35,440
Have some fun
Having me some fun tonight

793
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:51,863
ENGLISH - US - PSDH

Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
