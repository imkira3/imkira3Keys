2
00:01:13,582 --> 00:01:14,925
<i>Don't know
how many times</i>

3
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,254
<i>I've been crossed off the list
and left for dead.</i>

4
00:01:19,213 --> 00:01:22,308
<i>Guess when it first happens
the day you were born,</i>

5
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:25,053
<i>you're gonna lose count.</i>

6
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:31,350
<i>So this,</i>

7
00:01:32,601 --> 00:01:34,603
<i>this ain't nothing new.</i>

8
00:10:54,496 --> 00:10:56,419
<i>There are bad days,</i>

9
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:01,177
<i>and then there are
legendary bad days.</i>

10
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:06,015
<i>Whole damn planet
wanted a piece of me.</i>

11
00:11:10,387 --> 00:11:12,435
<i>Can't stay in the open.</i>

12
00:11:14,349 --> 00:11:16,067
<i>Can't risk another attack.</i>

13
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,175
<i>It's always the punch you don't
see coming that puts you down.</i>

14
00:11:43,628 --> 00:11:45,505
<i>But why didn't I see it?</i>

15
00:11:45,922 --> 00:11:48,016
<i>But why didn't I see it?</i>

16
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,223
<i>Of course they were
gonna try to kill me.</i>

17
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:56,854
<i>Death is what
they do for a living.</i>

18
00:12:02,313 --> 00:12:04,611
<i>So the question
ain't ”What happened?”</i>

19
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,947
<i>The question is</i>

20
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:11,035
<i>"What happened to me?”</i>

21
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,384
You are
the Lord Marshal now.

22
00:12:32,802 --> 00:12:34,975
<i>How did they get so close?</i>

23
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,812
<i>How did I let them
blindside me like that?</i>

24
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:45,153
Threshold!
Take us to the threshold!

25
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,989
<i>Necromongers.</i>

26
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:51,488
<i>Some wanted to put
a crown on my head.</i>

27
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:56,500
<i>Some wanted to put
a noose around my neck.</i>

28
00:12:59,496 --> 00:13:01,965
<i>Okay, more nooses than crowns.</i>

29
00:13:05,335 --> 00:13:07,178
<i>I needed a way out.</i>

30
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:11,178
<i>Some new place.</i>

31
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:16,188
<i>Or maybe just an old one.</i>

32
00:13:21,476 --> 00:13:24,446
<i>But how do you find something
you've never seen?</i>

33
00:13:26,564 --> 00:13:29,534
Please, come back to bed.

34
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:04,061
Sometimes I think you never
sleep, Lord Marshal.

35
00:14:06,271 --> 00:14:09,070
How can I sleep
when I have so many...

36
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,067
Distractions?

37
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:16,911
So what is the best way
to a man's heart?

38
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:20,706
Between the fourth
and fifth rib.

39
00:14:22,245 --> 00:14:23,918
That's where I usually go.

40
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:28,923
I'll put a twist at the end
if I wanna make sure.

41
00:14:31,087 --> 00:14:35,763
They'll never let you stand at the threshold
of Underverse without embracing the faith.

42
00:14:36,342 --> 00:14:40,313
That's why they come
after you, these assassins.

43
00:14:41,347 --> 00:14:43,816
They think of you
as something wrong.

44
00:14:44,267 --> 00:14:47,567
Cursed.
Illegitimate.

45
00:14:50,106 --> 00:14:52,609
What are you gonna do
when you're born that way?

46
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,031
Did you hear?

47
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:02,376
Do you think the guards
are still there?

48
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:15,298
Lord Marshal!

49
00:15:18,134 --> 00:15:19,761
Something like that?

50
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:35,660
I said between
the fourth and fifth.

51
00:15:37,987 --> 00:15:41,491
Fifth and sixth?
Body cavity.

52
00:16:03,388 --> 00:16:05,311
Making more friends,
I see.

53
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:07,813
But who put her up to it?

54
00:16:08,893 --> 00:16:10,520
Which commander?

55
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:13,614
It could be any of many.

56
00:16:15,525 --> 00:16:17,277
Don't doubt it for a second,

57
00:16:18,945 --> 00:16:20,162
Commander Vaako.

58
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:23,367
Lord Marshal.

59
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,343
They say you lost
your nerve, Vaako,

60
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,343
after that big swing
and a miss.

61
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,552
Is that what they say?

62
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,729
Now what are you gonna
do to get that cred back?

63
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,107
What's the big play?

64
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,823
Something splashy.

65
00:17:00,653 --> 00:17:01,654
Actually,

66
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,416
I had in mind
something different.

67
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:16,503
I've been thinking
about an early campaign.

68
00:17:17,712 --> 00:17:20,591
My very first.
I was but a boy.

69
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:25,061
We dropped from the sky
and did what Necromongers do.

70
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:30,896
Destruction was breathtaking.

71
00:17:33,436 --> 00:17:35,279
But then we met resistance.

72
00:17:36,898 --> 00:17:39,401
Ferocious like
a storm of lions.

73
00:17:42,278 --> 00:17:45,282
Each one of them killed
over a hundred Necro

74
00:17:46,115 --> 00:17:47,958
before their weapons failed.

75
00:17:50,787 --> 00:17:53,040
And then they killed
another 30 more.

76
00:17:53,956 --> 00:17:55,208
Barehanded.

77
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,634
Our firepower
and strength in numbers

78
00:18:00,755 --> 00:18:02,553
eventually won us the day.

79
00:18:03,966 --> 00:18:07,891
I can still see him, the last
of those magnificent warriors,

80
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:10,311
standing on a pile
of his own.

81
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:14,527
And he looked at me.

82
00:18:18,064 --> 00:18:21,113
And I will never
forget those eyes.

83
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:31,752
His eyes were just like yours.

84
00:18:36,499 --> 00:18:39,343
The planet was Furya.

85
00:18:40,211 --> 00:18:42,384
I know what it's called.

86
00:18:43,131 --> 00:18:45,225
You just don't
know where it is.

87
00:18:45,716 --> 00:18:48,185
I need charts. I need maps.

88
00:18:48,302 --> 00:18:50,054
Impossible.
I need a direction.

89
00:18:50,138 --> 00:18:52,266
Purged from all records,
as you well know.

90
00:18:52,348 --> 00:18:54,021
But you remember where.

91
00:18:57,854 --> 00:18:59,197
So many worlds...

92
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,823
The only map left in existence

93
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,535
is the one that's
in my head, Riddick.

94
00:19:14,537 --> 00:19:16,414
So what do you want?

95
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,292
The crown?

96
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,056
Transcendence.

97
00:19:30,303 --> 00:19:31,304
Krone.

98
00:19:32,513 --> 00:19:34,186
Break off a ship.

99
00:19:35,725 --> 00:19:37,568
Riddick's going home.

100
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:41,439
<i>Transcendence.</i>

101
00:19:42,565 --> 00:19:47,822
<i>I guess that was Necro speak for "Get the
fuck off our ship and make it forever."</i>

102
00:19:48,905 --> 00:19:50,248
<i>Fine by me.</i>

103
00:19:54,994 --> 00:19:57,838
<i>You can't blame him
for dangling Furya.</i>

104
00:19:59,081 --> 00:20:01,175
<i>Home has a certain equity.</i>

105
00:20:04,378 --> 00:20:08,178
<i>But I do blame him
for what came next.</i>

106
00:20:23,105 --> 00:20:25,233
It's along way to come.

107
00:20:26,067 --> 00:20:27,410
For this.

108
00:20:28,903 --> 00:20:32,203
<i>This guy with
the fucked-up face, Krone,</i>

109
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:35,626
<i>he was supposed to
be our ride home.</i>

110
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:42,675
<i>But instead of Furya,
we wind up someplace called...</i>

111
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,507
<i>Not Furya.</i>

112
00:20:54,595 --> 00:20:57,769
<i>Yet again, someone
was trying to play me.</i>

113
00:21:00,268 --> 00:21:01,736
<i>So yet again,</i>

114
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,028
<i>we play for blood.</i>

115
00:22:38,157 --> 00:22:40,876
You keep what
you kill, Riddick!

116
00:22:41,786 --> 00:22:43,880
You keep what you kill!

117
00:22:49,627 --> 00:22:52,597
<i>Somewhere along
the way, I lost a step.</i>

118
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:55,053
<i>I got sloppy.</i>

119
00:22:55,675 --> 00:22:57,518
<i>Dulled my own edge.</i>

120
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:02,607
<i>Maybe I went and did
the worst crime of all...</i>

121
00:23:04,225 --> 00:23:06,319
<i>I got civilized.</i>

122
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,949
<i>So now we zero the clock.</i>

123
00:23:17,863 --> 00:23:21,208
<i>Just me and
this no-name world.</i>

124
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:26,630
<i>Gotta find that
animal side again.</i>

125
00:25:02,718 --> 00:25:07,895
<i>Before long, I realized there was
</i> a <i>whole other world over there,</i>

126
00:25:09,016 --> 00:25:12,065
<i>of water, grass and life.</i>

127
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:17,115
<i>Just had one thing in my way.</i>

128
00:26:29,346 --> 00:26:31,565
Hey.

129
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:19,601
Come on, show me some teeth.

130
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:34,967
Escape artist, huh?

131
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:20,303
What you got over there?

132
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,817
Thought we shared everything.

133
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:58,716
Drop it.

134
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,572
Stay.

135
00:35:34,307 --> 00:35:35,729
Bounty hunters.

136
00:35:51,241 --> 00:35:52,458
Wait.

137
00:35:54,202 --> 00:35:55,545
Wait...

138
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:57,626
Steady...

139
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,050
Okay, now.

140
00:36:05,922 --> 00:36:07,139
Sounds good.

141
00:36:10,469 --> 00:36:11,470
Mmm...

142
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,601
Mmm!

143
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,233
All yours.

144
00:36:27,444 --> 00:36:29,572
It says "dog food" on it.

145
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,157
If you could read.

146
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,830
Come on.

147
00:36:45,128 --> 00:36:47,347
All right.
Bring me my reserve.

148
00:37:01,311 --> 00:37:02,733
Where's yours?

149
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:34,223
Rain.

150
00:37:34,302 --> 00:37:36,054
It's a good thing.

151
00:37:37,097 --> 00:37:40,977
Just because you've never seen it
before doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

152
00:37:41,434 --> 00:37:43,186
Hey, easy.

153
00:37:57,951 --> 00:38:00,420
Looks like our
time is up here.

154
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,707
Nothing.

155
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:04,877
Look again, Diaz.

156
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,544
Somebody should teach this
Riddick asshole how to count.

157
00:40:11,835 --> 00:40:16,181
"Leave one ship"? Like we've got
a fucking spare laying around.

158
00:40:16,756 --> 00:40:18,383
Let's crank it up.

159
00:40:29,269 --> 00:40:31,397
Good morning, Cyclops.

160
00:40:55,295 --> 00:40:56,421
Hey, Luna.

161
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:00,391
Yeah.

162
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:02,302
Wake her up,
kick her out of bed.

163
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,596
What do you mean?

164
00:41:04,929 --> 00:41:06,556
We're running heavy.

165
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:08,478
She's a prisoner. Wasn't she
gonna pay our way back?

166
00:41:08,558 --> 00:41:10,276
We're going
big now.

167
00:41:10,643 --> 00:41:13,943
Okay?
Cut that 60 kilos loose.

168
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:31,957
Get away!
Get away from me!

169
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:33,549
Stop, just stop!

170
00:41:33,625 --> 00:41:35,252
What do you want now?

171
00:41:35,335 --> 00:41:38,088
I'm gonna take off
the restraints. Okay?

172
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:41,181
I don't want them off.

173
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:42,304
No, it's not like that.

174
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,019
Nobody is gonna
touch you now.

175
00:41:45,428 --> 00:41:47,271
Santana's head is
into other stuff now.

176
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:50,354
Your lucky day.

177
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,491
Get the fuck away from me.

178
00:41:58,650 --> 00:41:59,993
Okay.

179
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,078
What planet is this?
Where are we?

180
00:42:03,154 --> 00:42:04,781
It's got air and water.
That's all you've got to know.

181
00:42:10,161 --> 00:42:12,084
But how am I supposed to survive...
Just go.

182
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:14,632
Before he changes his mind.

183
00:42:40,525 --> 00:42:42,778
I was getting attached to her.

184
00:42:45,405 --> 00:42:47,453
Now where is my box at?

185
00:43:10,388 --> 00:43:13,392
The name is Santana!

186
00:43:14,601 --> 00:43:17,400
Shot-caller for
this crew right here!

187
00:43:18,646 --> 00:43:21,069
I am the guy who knows all,

188
00:43:21,566 --> 00:43:24,490
sees all, beats all...

189
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,323
Spitting it kind
of strong, ain't he?

190
00:43:29,073 --> 00:43:30,916
Got to bait the trap.

191
00:43:31,326 --> 00:43:35,672
I've come all this way
to collect your head in a box!

192
00:43:35,914 --> 00:43:37,541
Right here!

193
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:41,128
So have yourself
a fine day now,

194
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:43,133
Mr. Richard B. Riddick!

195
00:43:44,297 --> 00:43:45,674
I suspect

196
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:50,812
it will be one
of your very last!

197
00:43:51,596 --> 00:43:55,772
Yeah, well, you don't need to agitate
Riddick any more than, you know.

198
00:43:57,143 --> 00:44:00,613
Any more than bringing his
head back in a box would?

199
00:44:25,922 --> 00:44:29,802
Shit.
Here comes the neighborhood.

200
00:44:34,973 --> 00:44:36,475
Small world.

201
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:48,616
Unidentified vessel, this is
Clan Vagos out of Ursa Five.

202
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,948
Be advised that we
are on the ground now

203
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:53,408
and have responded to
an emergency signal.

204
00:44:53,533 --> 00:44:57,037
No distress found,
no need to land.

205
00:44:57,662 --> 00:45:02,338
I repeat, there is no reason for you
to land at this location at this time.

206
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:03,967
<i>Is that clear?</i>

207
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:08,139
<i>No reason for you to land at
this location at this time.</i>

208
00:45:10,717 --> 00:45:12,890
What the fuck
did I just say?

209
00:45:30,403 --> 00:45:32,531
It was a long haul.
We could take on some water.

210
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:36,455
Wouldn't mind a little
true-gravity time either.

211
00:45:36,909 --> 00:45:40,209
Like I was saying,
I've got this.

212
00:45:46,753 --> 00:45:50,257
You knew who that was, right?
On the emergency beacon?

213
00:45:52,675 --> 00:45:54,268
Wouldn't be here
if I didn't.

214
00:45:56,345 --> 00:45:58,768
The concept of back-up
still has no appeal to you?

215
00:45:59,182 --> 00:46:01,731
My besties here
can ball with anyone.

216
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:04,069
No disrespect for
your crew, of course,

217
00:46:04,145 --> 00:46:08,150
who look strong, too,
in those matchy-matchy outfits.

218
00:46:09,275 --> 00:46:11,573
Shit. Didn't know
there was a dress code.

219
00:46:12,153 --> 00:46:13,200
Yeah, right?

220
00:46:13,488 --> 00:46:16,583
Well, it's not my intention
to jump another man's claim.

221
00:46:17,158 --> 00:46:18,751
If you don't mind, maybe
we'll just pull up a chair

222
00:46:18,826 --> 00:46:20,544
and spectate for a while.

223
00:46:22,163 --> 00:46:23,585
What if I do?

224
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:27,419
Well, this is a co-op station, pal.
It's open to all Mercs.

225
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,469
By the way, my name is...
"Too late."

226
00:46:31,672 --> 00:46:34,642
That's your name.
"Too Late."

227
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:38,184
And I don't need you stepping all
over my dick here, my friend.

228
00:46:39,305 --> 00:46:41,148
Well, I'll tell you what.

229
00:46:42,016 --> 00:46:46,271
I won't lift a finger to help until
you come ask me for it. How's that?

230
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:05,210
I was scoping
this out earlier.

231
00:47:05,331 --> 00:47:07,299
It's a cave system.
Five clicks south.

232
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,172
Might be worth a look.

233
00:47:10,503 --> 00:47:12,130
Hey, Too Late.

234
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:14,303
Need to pull a node
from your ship

235
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:16,138
and store it right here
next to mine. Okay?

236
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:17,719
Really? Why is that?

237
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:21,272
Riddick triggered the beacon
to get off-world, right?

238
00:47:21,806 --> 00:47:25,902
Basically,
he was calling a taxi.

239
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:28,942
And...

240
00:47:29,397 --> 00:47:31,991
And a ship would make
a sweet trap, right?

241
00:47:32,316 --> 00:47:36,366
Confined space,
metal walls, jail cell.

242
00:47:37,697 --> 00:47:38,869
Is cool, huh?

243
00:47:39,157 --> 00:47:40,830
Is it true half
the people you meet

244
00:47:40,908 --> 00:47:42,581
are below average
intelligence?

245
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:45,413
Got to make sure the ship stays
grounded when he comes for them, okay?

246
00:47:45,496 --> 00:47:47,214
Come on.

247
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:50,509
Dahl, pull a node
from the ship.

248
00:48:15,193 --> 00:48:16,285
I'll do it...

249
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,407
Ooh!

250
00:48:17,486 --> 00:48:18,487
Ooh...

251
00:48:37,965 --> 00:48:39,888
Any time now, Riddick.

252
00:49:03,658 --> 00:49:05,581
I'm telling you,
this is total overkill.

253
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,620
What? Eleven of us
out here now?

254
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,623
Should have been
a four-man op, tops.

255
00:49:10,873 --> 00:49:13,717
You are jinxing our janx, man.
And that ain't cool.

256
00:49:13,793 --> 00:49:17,172
Hey, I don't give a shit what they say.
He's one guy.

257
00:49:19,548 --> 00:49:21,266
Whatever you say, man.

258
00:49:22,093 --> 00:49:23,766
He's one guy.

259
00:49:27,098 --> 00:49:28,270
Man...

260
00:49:39,068 --> 00:49:41,992
So I guess that's what passes for
a fucking moon on this planet.

261
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:45,375
It's gonna be
a dark night.

262
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:47,497
Advantage, him.

263
00:49:48,786 --> 00:49:52,836
Maybe he's gonna wear you down first.
Force you to go without sleep.

264
00:49:52,915 --> 00:49:54,792
Can't you see I'm busy?

265
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:57,845
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

266
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:00,594
Well, now that you have,

267
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,553
can I politely invite you to

268
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:07,058
step off my fucking porch?

269
00:50:09,765 --> 00:50:11,688
I'll start rotating down.

270
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:13,189
You let me know, huh?

271
00:50:13,269 --> 00:50:16,899
As soon as I have his head in
a box, I will let you know.

272
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:43,678
Grid 29D.
Stand by, stand by.

273
00:50:48,804 --> 00:50:50,431
What you got, cuz?

274
00:50:52,308 --> 00:50:55,733
Aha, some dingo-dongo thing.

275
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:01,826
Yeah. I see it now.

276
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:03,410
<i>You want me to pop it?</i>

277
00:51:03,486 --> 00:51:06,035
Knock it down.
One shot suppressed.

278
00:51:11,118 --> 00:51:13,712
Nice work, Diaz.
Encouraging.

279
00:51:14,622 --> 00:51:16,295
Had something in my eye.

280
00:51:16,749 --> 00:51:18,342
<i>It's called a scope.</i>

281
00:51:18,501 --> 00:51:20,094
<i>Try next time.</i>

282
00:51:20,336 --> 00:51:21,883
<i>You got this, right?</i>

283
00:51:23,130 --> 00:51:25,724
Will you get off
my freaking frequency!

284
00:51:49,532 --> 00:51:51,000
What the fuck
is going on here?

285
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,183
<i>Thank fucking God!</i>

286
00:52:15,933 --> 00:52:17,230
Fuck off!

287
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:23,900
Rubio, coming your way now.
Gotta swap out a bad sensor.

288
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:30,448
What was here
versus what was found.

289
00:52:30,781 --> 00:52:32,454
How does it square?

290
00:52:32,533 --> 00:52:34,376
Pretty good. I mean,
the morphine's gone,

291
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:37,126
but that's always
the first thing to go.

292
00:52:37,913 --> 00:52:40,007
That was a bit weird, though.

293
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:44,049
"A predator restraint
with 42-inch offset jaws."

294
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:46,590
Six listed, zero found.

295
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:49,759
That is an odd thing
to go for a walk.

296
00:52:50,092 --> 00:52:52,845
Yeah, but, Boss, you know how shit
goes missing from these stations.

297
00:52:52,928 --> 00:52:56,148
One bad year and guys are
ripping shit off for salvage.

298
00:53:04,482 --> 00:53:05,950
Hey, Santana?

299
00:53:06,734 --> 00:53:09,237
You did sweep the area
before I got here, right?

300
00:53:09,570 --> 00:53:11,288
Sweep for what?

301
00:53:11,572 --> 00:53:13,791
<i>I just want to make sure
no one has set any traps for us.</i>

302
00:53:13,866 --> 00:53:15,118
5Q.

303
00:53:18,078 --> 00:53:19,671
Understand what I'm saying?

304
00:53:19,872 --> 00:53:22,045
Traps?
What kind of traps?

305
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:24,093
<i>The kind with jaws.</i>

306
00:53:31,217 --> 00:53:32,890
Don't touch
that fucking thing!

307
00:53:39,350 --> 00:53:40,351
What?

308
00:53:44,563 --> 00:53:45,610
Up-armor.

309
00:53:56,492 --> 00:53:57,539
Shit!

310
00:53:57,868 --> 00:53:59,370
Ready. Ready.

311
00:54:02,456 --> 00:54:05,380
Stay put, stay
put, stay put, stay put!

312
00:54:08,963 --> 00:54:10,180
Oopah!

313
00:54:14,843 --> 00:54:17,642
<i>Who the hell was
that screaming and why?</i>

314
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:22,735
Nunez, break out
the sweep gear.

315
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:27,152
And figure out how many
of these big-ass traps

316
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:29,199
we got out here, okay?

317
00:54:30,276 --> 00:54:32,654
I'm thinking maybe
the whole upper left quad

318
00:54:32,778 --> 00:54:35,122
is some kind of
fucking mine field.

319
00:54:35,656 --> 00:54:37,909
You got to do that now,
okay, Nunez?

320
00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:41,537
<i>Copy that, Nunez?</i>

321
00:54:46,208 --> 00:54:47,755
Nunez?

322
00:54:49,837 --> 00:54:52,431
This is bad.
This is very bad.

323
00:54:54,592 --> 00:54:55,889
Nunez?
Nunez?

324
00:54:55,968 --> 00:54:57,436
Shut the fuck up, <i>puto!</i>

325
00:54:57,511 --> 00:55:00,105
His radio just crapped out.
Someone get eyes on him.

326
00:55:00,472 --> 00:55:03,521
<i>Make sure he's right where he
should be, 13-H. Go, go, go!</i>

327
00:55:10,816 --> 00:55:11,942
Right here.

328
00:55:12,026 --> 00:55:14,154
13-H. He's supposed
to be right fucking...

329
00:55:20,659 --> 00:55:24,163
So this was overkill, huh?
Eleven of us, too many. Yeah.

330
00:55:24,246 --> 00:55:26,089
You know all
about Riddick, right?

331
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:29,089
Well, maybe you need
to take that shit back!

332
00:55:29,293 --> 00:55:32,263
Take the jinx off our janx.
You understand me?

333
00:55:32,963 --> 00:55:34,590
That's what you
need to do, Falco.

334
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:37,517
You need to unjinxelate
our fucking janx!

335
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,736
Don't mess with me now.

336
00:55:48,854 --> 00:55:49,946
Hey. Hey, what is it?
What is it?

337
00:55:50,022 --> 00:55:51,239
Get back!
It's me, it's me.

338
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:52,737
He's got Falco!

339
00:56:01,575 --> 00:56:03,794
Jock up,
but you're staying home.

340
00:56:04,703 --> 00:56:07,252
No one's going out
there until I say so.

341
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:08,878
<i>Man down,
he's got Falco.</i>

342
00:56:08,999 --> 00:56:10,216
<i>Compromise, compromise.</i>

343
00:56:10,292 --> 00:56:11,259
<i>How the fuck did he do that?</i>

344
00:56:11,335 --> 00:56:13,303
<i>Never ever saw him, man.
He was right here and I never...</i>

345
00:56:13,379 --> 00:56:14,426
<i>What about</i>
<i>the ship? Is he on it?</i>

346
00:56:14,505 --> 00:56:16,507
<i>He's not coming for the
ships, he's coming for fucking us!</i>

347
00:56:16,590 --> 00:56:18,183
<i>Just fucking shoot!
Shoot!</i>

348
00:56:26,517 --> 00:56:28,269
One night, three dead.

349
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,737
Not sure
I'm loving this trend.

350
00:56:31,438 --> 00:56:32,610
Two dead, one missing.

351
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:34,158
Exactly.
Three dead.

352
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:36,861
Well, look at it
this way, boys.

353
00:56:39,238 --> 00:56:41,115
We might all fit
on one ship now.

354
00:56:41,198 --> 00:56:42,290
Diaz!

355
00:56:46,954 --> 00:56:48,831
Get those other
traps back there.

356
00:56:49,456 --> 00:56:53,632
Luna, say something Bible-like
over these bodies.

357
00:57:03,846 --> 00:57:05,598
Okay, maybe,

358
00:57:07,266 --> 00:57:09,109
we zero this out.

359
00:57:11,186 --> 00:57:12,733
What is your tag anyway?

360
00:57:13,272 --> 00:57:15,195
So now you wanna know my name.

361
00:57:17,985 --> 00:57:19,737
Well, I'm not sure
I'm gonna say.

362
00:57:19,903 --> 00:57:22,907
Because everyone you know by
name, Santana, winds up dead.

363
00:57:26,118 --> 00:57:27,586
You gonna clean this shit up?

364
00:57:37,171 --> 00:57:38,844
Excuse me.
Wow.

365
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,429
Watch out for
surprise attacks.

366
00:57:42,301 --> 00:57:43,393
Maybe...

367
00:57:44,136 --> 00:57:48,061
Maybe it's time to start
merging assets, right?

368
00:57:50,684 --> 00:57:52,607
So this is you
asking for my help?

369
00:57:53,020 --> 00:57:56,399
This is me saying that I may
need some of your gear.

370
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:01,905
If some of your guys happen to
come attached to that gear,

371
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:06,618
I will understand
that's the way it's gotta be.

372
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,995
So you're asking
for my gear's help?

373
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:12,210
More like that.

374
00:58:13,290 --> 00:58:14,507
Moss...

375
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:24,101
The gear's saying, "Nah."
Bitch.

376
00:58:24,968 --> 00:58:26,436
There's your answer.

377
00:58:26,512 --> 00:58:28,640
What the fuck
do you want, man?

378
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:32,106
You know what? I'm gonna
fold you in, Santana.

379
00:58:32,476 --> 00:58:36,447
But I give orders to Dahl. And
Delhi's gonna give orders to you.

380
00:58:36,730 --> 00:58:39,609
And that's the chain of command
from this point forward.

381
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:42,824
Why am I not
loving this plan so far?

382
00:58:44,029 --> 00:58:46,657
Oh, I know, I know.
You know why?

383
00:58:46,824 --> 00:58:49,293
Because it sucks ass
and swallows!

384
00:58:49,827 --> 00:58:52,376
I'm not taking orders
from your pet whore

385
00:58:52,454 --> 00:58:53,922
who thinks I won't
smack her right back...

386
00:58:56,667 --> 00:58:58,294
I don't fuck guys.

387
00:58:59,336 --> 00:59:01,839
Occasionally I fuck 'em up
if they need it.

388
00:59:04,508 --> 00:59:07,728
Here's what's gonna happen, Santana.
You're gonna take a back seat.

389
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:09,854
We'll track Riddick
down, I promise.

390
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:12,016
But I want him alive.

391
00:59:12,349 --> 00:59:16,229
You give me a day, and after
that he's yours to kill.

392
00:59:16,854 --> 00:59:18,606
You're giving me the bounty?

393
00:59:18,689 --> 00:59:22,739
You pay my crew, fuel costs,
the rest is yours. That's the deal.

394
00:59:24,361 --> 00:59:28,457
What is Riddick for you?
Not just some convict.

395
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:31,494
What do you want?
Why are you here?

396
00:59:31,952 --> 00:59:33,078
Who are you?

397
00:59:34,454 --> 00:59:35,706
My name is Johns.

398
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:38,425
Lock down those ships,
get those hogs on deck.

399
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:40,423
I will ride with
Moss and Lockspur.

400
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:44,723
I want a non-lethal load-out, L.O.D.'s
and phosphor frags to start with.

401
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:48,723
This is a man that hunts by night.
We'll take it to him by day.

402
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:53,398
Diaz! Vargas! Show me the
spot of the last kill.

403
00:59:56,727 --> 00:59:58,229
Some kind of canine.

404
01:00:11,241 --> 01:00:13,710
Hey, Diaz, I got a dog here.

405
01:00:14,202 --> 01:00:17,172
Is it the same dingo-dongo
thing from last night?

406
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:19,128
Nah, I'm pretty sure
we killed that one.

407
01:00:26,757 --> 01:00:28,259
Could be the same one.

408
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:29,889
The same.

409
01:00:29,968 --> 01:00:32,687
Dahl, get your sniper rifle
and barium rounds now.

410
01:00:44,483 --> 01:00:45,951
1,500 meters.

411
01:01:58,807 --> 01:02:00,855
Could be just the first hole it found.

412
01:02:01,435 --> 01:02:04,609
A stressed animal is gonna
run to ground it knows.

413
01:02:06,106 --> 01:02:08,950
Besides,
I'm getting human pheromones.

414
01:03:32,317 --> 01:03:33,660
Riddick!

415
01:03:40,951 --> 01:03:42,999
Dial down,
dial down, dial down!

416
01:03:50,961 --> 01:03:52,213
Santana's guy.

417
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:53,342
Falco.

418
01:03:53,421 --> 01:03:55,389
Shit.
Did we just kill a hostage?

419
01:03:55,465 --> 01:03:57,217
I've been hunting
Riddick for 10 years.

420
01:03:57,467 --> 01:04:00,311
The concept of a hostage
has no appeal to him.

421
01:04:00,387 --> 01:04:02,264
Falco was already dead.

422
01:04:02,764 --> 01:04:05,859
This is just some fucking
sideshow to buy more time.

423
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:10,568
Whoa! Fuck...

424
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:12,991
Shit.

425
01:04:16,403 --> 01:04:18,246
Just dropped some
mud right there.

426
01:04:19,406 --> 01:04:21,500
So if Riddick isn't here...

427
01:05:01,948 --> 01:05:05,703
Dahl? Dahl, do you copy?
Does anyone copy?

428
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:07,958
Dahl, you there?

429
01:06:03,927 --> 01:06:05,099
Boom.

430
01:06:09,057 --> 01:06:11,025
Were you just perving out
on me somehow?

431
01:06:11,768 --> 01:06:14,612
May all your dreams
come true, baby.

432
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:19,698
You've got two minutes. I want
you out on fucking watch.

433
01:06:25,573 --> 01:06:26,699
Luna!

434
01:06:31,788 --> 01:06:35,634
Don't watch me. Watch my back.
That's what you're here for.

435
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:38,928
Take two steps forward.
Two.

436
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,691
Remember,
he could be anywhere.

437
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,744
<i>This is Johns to
any-goddamn-body at the station.</i>

438
01:07:45,362 --> 01:07:49,492
<i>I want you to keep an eye on that locker.
Keep an eye on the node.</i>

439
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:52,327
<i>Riddick may have
made an end run.</i>

440
01:07:52,911 --> 01:07:56,757
<i>My ETA is seven minutes.
But watch your back.</i>

441
01:08:06,424 --> 01:08:08,301
All right,
you little bitch.

442
01:08:10,470 --> 01:08:13,269
Your two minutes are up. You
gonna do what I tell you to do?

443
01:08:14,265 --> 01:08:16,893
Rumor is Riddick
might be in the vicinity.

444
01:08:17,102 --> 01:08:19,651
Thought I should just
check on the locker.

445
01:08:21,356 --> 01:08:25,827
Get outside, get on your optics,
and get after this fucker!

446
01:08:26,444 --> 01:08:28,538
You're not
gonna find him here.

447
01:08:41,543 --> 01:08:45,764
Actually, Dahl, I think we
have something in common.

448
01:08:46,714 --> 01:08:49,558
I don't fuck guys either.

449
01:09:34,929 --> 01:09:36,727
You need to see this.

450
01:09:45,398 --> 01:09:46,524
He wrote that?

451
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:50,988
He took out our deep space
communications. All of it.

452
01:09:51,779 --> 01:09:55,079
And whose blood is that?
There... Here...

453
01:09:55,783 --> 01:09:57,410
Over there...

454
01:10:02,707 --> 01:10:05,460
I had to kick
his ass again. Sorry.

455
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:07,962
Not really.

456
01:10:16,012 --> 01:10:17,104
Fuck it.

457
01:10:18,515 --> 01:10:20,734
Let's take a look at this.

458
01:10:32,153 --> 01:10:33,370
Stop.

459
01:10:36,032 --> 01:10:37,534
That key leave your neck?

460
01:10:39,536 --> 01:10:40,537
Never.

461
01:10:40,954 --> 01:10:42,706
Well, the only reason
to write "fair trade"

462
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:46,635
is if he got into that locker
and he took something out.

463
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:50,054
Something that we need,
like a power node,

464
01:10:50,171 --> 01:10:53,266
which he could then swap
for something he needs.

465
01:10:54,217 --> 01:10:56,515
All that?
Wow.

466
01:10:57,053 --> 01:10:59,226
Highly unlikely.

467
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,108
Let me join the fucking dots
for you, Santana.

468
01:11:03,184 --> 01:11:04,902
Here's what I'm saying. If
he did get in there somehow,

469
01:11:04,978 --> 01:11:08,903
he was in a position to
relock it and change the code.

470
01:11:10,358 --> 01:11:12,235
Could be entering
the wrong shit, Santana.

471
01:11:14,529 --> 01:11:15,746
So,

472
01:11:17,240 --> 01:11:21,541
do you think sometime
during the last few hours

473
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:25,791
he got this off my neck
without me noticing,

474
01:11:25,873 --> 01:11:28,877
did whatever he did,
put the fucking key back

475
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:31,930
on my fucking neck
without me fucking noticing?

476
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:33,757
Is that what you're saying?

477
01:11:34,048 --> 01:11:37,769
Where did you get that theory from?
A unicorn's ass?

478
01:11:37,969 --> 01:11:40,017
There's a reason
he is who he is.

479
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:43,976
He's a convict.
Not some Zulu warlock.

480
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:46,732
You know what you know.

481
01:12:02,118 --> 01:12:03,586
This is crazy.

482
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:07,461
This is fucking crazy.
The first three clicks were good.

483
01:12:07,999 --> 01:12:09,376
It did not go off.

484
01:12:09,459 --> 01:12:12,053
You can get three clicks
in Russian roulette.

485
01:12:12,128 --> 01:12:14,051
Doesn't mean you get four,
motherfucker.

486
01:12:14,130 --> 01:12:15,382
You know what, Santana?

487
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:17,388
For once I actually agree with you.
I think you're good.

488
01:12:18,343 --> 01:12:19,469
Shut up.

489
01:12:22,680 --> 01:12:24,978
You. Do you think we're good?

490
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:27,101
Yeah.

491
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,153
I think you're good, cuz.

492
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,527
You're fucking good.
Just butch up.

493
01:12:32,732 --> 01:12:35,952
Sounds like your department,
lesbo.

494
01:12:36,486 --> 01:12:37,578
I'm not opening that thing.

495
01:12:37,654 --> 01:12:38,871
Oh, yes, you fucking are!

496
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:40,160
I'm so fucking not!

497
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,836
Hey, hey, hey!
Use your fucking brains!

498
01:12:45,036 --> 01:12:48,085
We are not gonna do
Riddick's work for him!

499
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,504
Put your weapons down.

500
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,343
And have a look at that.

501
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:54,925
He was here.

502
01:12:55,380 --> 01:12:56,848
Right fucking there.

503
01:12:57,382 --> 01:13:00,056
Santana,
put your fucking sword away.

504
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,227
Don't fucking open it, then.

505
01:13:05,515 --> 01:13:08,610
Well, the problem with that,
Santana, we never open that locker,

506
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:10,437
and we never leave.

507
01:13:31,457 --> 01:13:33,209
The strength of my life
of Whom shall I be afraid.

508
01:13:38,631 --> 01:13:39,632
Four.

509
01:13:40,717 --> 01:13:42,219
Try five.

510
01:13:48,099 --> 01:13:49,316
Five.

511
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:56,824
And...

512
01:14:03,406 --> 01:14:04,532
Oops.

513
01:14:05,616 --> 01:14:07,539
Wish I'd have thought of that.

514
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,887
Six!

515
01:14:22,467 --> 01:14:23,639
Six.

516
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:25,428
Huh.

517
01:14:28,264 --> 01:14:29,436
Six.

518
01:14:31,601 --> 01:14:35,105
You are a shit storm trooper, Santana.
I'll give you that.

519
01:14:35,438 --> 01:14:37,566
You beat
the devil this time.

520
01:14:37,648 --> 01:14:40,026
Didn't actually
think he was gonna do it.

521
01:14:40,568 --> 01:14:42,286
This is a sign.

522
01:14:43,446 --> 01:14:47,121
Ah, sweet.

523
01:14:47,450 --> 01:14:49,293
I believe this is a sign.

524
01:14:51,996 --> 01:14:54,795
It may be that the good Lord
wants us to take these nodes

525
01:14:55,082 --> 01:14:58,302
and flee this planet
just as soon as we can.

526
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:04,805
That's my good luck charm.

527
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:09,977
Wrong business, kid.

528
01:15:11,098 --> 01:15:14,648
You know, I was kind of
hoping the bomb would go off.

529
01:15:23,486 --> 01:15:28,083
So we sealed up his cave with some
phosphor frags here, so he can't go back.

530
01:15:28,157 --> 01:15:31,127
And just like an animal, he's
gonna head to known ground.

531
01:15:31,202 --> 01:15:34,206
But we're gonna find he's got
three or four lairs out there.

532
01:15:34,288 --> 01:15:37,167
So we'll radius out
from this point, here.

533
01:15:37,708 --> 01:15:41,554
Now radio comms... I saw three
repeaters listed in inventory.

534
01:15:41,629 --> 01:15:44,508
Find them. Set them up
at regular intervals.

535
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:47,430
I never want to be
out of touch like that again.

536
01:16:22,712 --> 01:16:24,555
Are you scared of me?

537
01:16:26,674 --> 01:16:27,800
Yeah.

538
01:16:31,846 --> 01:16:33,769
Are they scared of me?

539
01:16:35,433 --> 01:16:37,652
Yes, they're scared of you.

540
01:16:43,566 --> 01:16:46,365
Maybe you're all
scared of the wrong thing.

541
01:16:46,903 --> 01:16:49,156
Lockspur, I want you to lock
down those hogs, all right?

542
01:16:49,238 --> 01:16:52,412
I don't want this guy any more
mobile than he already is.

543
01:16:52,491 --> 01:16:55,165
Now, Dahl, I spotted
a nice little nest for you.

544
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,167
Right here and in
these low hills.

545
01:17:03,878 --> 01:17:04,970
Moss?

546
01:17:08,466 --> 01:17:10,093
I just saw him.

547
01:17:11,594 --> 01:17:13,221
Say again?

548
01:17:14,055 --> 01:17:15,682
I just saw him.

549
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:27,993
Dahl, I want you
to sit on this ship!

550
01:17:28,069 --> 01:17:30,538
Diaz, make sure your
ship is locked down!

551
01:17:30,613 --> 01:17:32,581
The rest of you get on
the fucking perimeter

552
01:17:32,698 --> 01:17:34,666
and keep your
eyes on each other!

553
01:17:34,742 --> 01:17:38,121
Santana!
He got the fucking nodes!

554
01:18:25,876 --> 01:18:28,379
I know. It's coming.

555
01:18:31,716 --> 01:18:33,309
So then we just combine nodes.

556
01:18:33,384 --> 01:18:35,478
Pull one from that ship, put
it in this ship, you know?

557
01:18:35,553 --> 01:18:36,645
Amps is amps, right?

558
01:18:36,721 --> 01:18:39,270
It's not about amps. It's about
What each ship is rated to handle.

559
01:18:39,473 --> 01:18:42,147
You miss by even a few milli-joules,
you fry every chip you've got.

560
01:18:42,226 --> 01:18:44,524
Okay, so figure out the
difference, and just do it.

561
01:18:44,687 --> 01:18:46,234
Jailbreak the fucking thing.

562
01:18:46,439 --> 01:18:48,282
I could give
you a crash course

563
01:18:48,357 --> 01:18:51,611
on thermodynamic equilibrium
and energy exchange right now,

564
01:18:51,694 --> 01:18:53,662
or maybe you just want to
take my goddamn word for it...

565
01:18:53,738 --> 01:18:55,035
I get it. I get it.

566
01:18:55,197 --> 01:18:58,167
The ships are incompatible. We're not
gonna fly without the nodes back.

567
01:18:58,242 --> 01:19:00,290
Why do I feel like we just
cut off our own nuts here?

568
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:01,666
Probably because we did.

569
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:04,507
How about I take one of those jet
hogs, two days' worth of food

570
01:19:04,582 --> 01:19:06,300
and go out and hunt
this fucker down myself?

571
01:19:06,375 --> 01:19:08,878
Bad idea, Diaz.
One-on-one with Riddick?

572
01:19:09,045 --> 01:19:11,423
I might be able to get the
emergency beacon working again.

573
01:19:11,630 --> 01:19:14,053
That's like an ambulance calling
for an ambulance, isn't it?

574
01:19:14,133 --> 01:19:16,227
It's back-up for the fucking back-up.
We can't.

575
01:19:16,469 --> 01:19:18,096
I thought he was
the one stranded here.

576
01:19:18,179 --> 01:19:20,022
Yeah, well,
looks like you thought wrong.

577
01:19:20,097 --> 01:19:22,395
<i>Long wait for back-up.</i>

578
01:19:24,143 --> 01:19:25,440
In case you were
thinking about

579
01:19:25,519 --> 01:19:28,272
<i>fixing the beacon
and calling for help.</i>

580
01:19:28,647 --> 01:19:30,240
Falco's radio.

581
01:19:30,566 --> 01:19:33,740
Riddick, I don't give a
fuck about the back-up.

582
01:19:34,612 --> 01:19:36,205
Because I've still
got all kinds of gear

583
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:37,782
that can ruin your day
in a hurry.

584
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:42,708
So you go find
another fucking cave.

585
01:19:43,162 --> 01:19:45,585
You keep runnin',
you keep hidin'.

586
01:19:46,332 --> 01:19:48,300
Doesn't matter me none.

587
01:19:49,126 --> 01:19:51,845
Because in the end,
I will find you!

588
01:19:54,590 --> 01:19:56,183
Look south.

589
01:20:17,488 --> 01:20:19,286
I don't believe it.

590
01:20:19,740 --> 01:20:21,993
The balls on
this fucking guy.

591
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:26,714
Dahl, keep an eye
on things here.

592
01:20:29,083 --> 01:20:30,130
What should I do?

593
01:20:30,209 --> 01:20:31,210
Stay low.

594
01:20:34,046 --> 01:20:35,798
Come on.
Come on.

595
01:20:57,528 --> 01:20:59,155
Both of you drop.

596
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:24,017
So what's the bounty at?

597
01:21:24,430 --> 01:21:27,183
I don't know. I don't care.
It's not why I'm here.

598
01:21:27,266 --> 01:21:29,439
I bet
the big jamoke knows.

599
01:21:29,768 --> 01:21:32,271
Yeah. I know
exactly what it is.

600
01:21:32,938 --> 01:21:36,442
What I do know is that it's double
if you're brought back dead.

601
01:21:37,318 --> 01:21:38,740
That's new.

602
01:21:40,279 --> 01:21:43,032
Will it be enough to
pay for your funerals?

603
01:21:44,825 --> 01:21:46,748
What I'm interested in

604
01:21:47,119 --> 01:21:51,465
is a little backwater place
with a system code M-344/G.

605
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,257
I want to know what
happened there 10 years ago.

606
01:21:58,297 --> 01:21:59,674
The father.

607
01:22:03,636 --> 01:22:04,979
Big Daddy Johns.

608
01:22:05,095 --> 01:22:06,438
Yeah, that's right.

609
01:22:06,764 --> 01:22:10,394
And you traveled all
this way just to see me.

610
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:13,945
I'm flattered.

611
01:22:14,521 --> 01:22:15,568
It's kind of
strange not knowing

612
01:22:15,648 --> 01:22:17,400
what to put down
in the family bible.

613
01:22:17,858 --> 01:22:20,953
It's kind of strange three guys have
to die just so that you can hear...

614
01:22:21,028 --> 01:22:23,907
No, no, no. You don't get
to put that shit on me.

615
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:26,124
Those kills are on you.

616
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:29,920
I have a feeling that's not the
only thing on me right now.

617
01:22:30,371 --> 01:22:33,250
Okay, got barium shells,
stab-shock, explosive tip.

618
01:22:33,332 --> 01:22:35,551
What do you want,
barium or stab-shock?

619
01:22:36,043 --> 01:22:37,590
Horse tranq.

620
01:22:38,212 --> 01:22:39,259
Okay.

621
01:22:44,510 --> 01:22:48,014
I hate to interrupt this
discussion about ancient history,

622
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:51,101
but maybe I should step in right
here and introduce myself.

623
01:22:51,475 --> 01:22:53,477
My name is...
Box Boy.

624
01:22:55,479 --> 01:22:56,856
Say What?

625
01:22:57,022 --> 01:23:01,619
You are the guy who said that he was
gonna put my head in a box. Right?

626
01:23:02,611 --> 01:23:06,286
Well,
that was me spitting noise.

627
01:23:08,158 --> 01:23:09,956
But you do have a box.

628
01:23:10,160 --> 01:23:11,878
Do I have a box?

629
01:23:12,079 --> 01:23:13,752
Thought I saw one.

630
01:23:15,374 --> 01:23:18,844
I mean, of course I've got a box.
Everyone's got a box, man.

631
01:23:18,919 --> 01:23:21,547
Even Diaz has
a fucking huge box.

632
01:23:22,548 --> 01:23:23,800
Good.

633
01:23:24,842 --> 01:23:26,560
We're gonna use it.

634
01:23:30,389 --> 01:23:32,642
Three down, eight left.

635
01:23:33,392 --> 01:23:35,486
Now, normally
I'd just keep going.

636
01:23:35,894 --> 01:23:39,444
Six down... Nine down...

637
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:42,993
You get where I'm
going with this.

638
01:23:43,694 --> 01:23:45,241
But things are changing here

639
01:23:45,446 --> 01:23:49,167
and nobody wants to be on this
planet 24 hours from now.

640
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,328
So I suggest
we make it work.

641
01:23:52,911 --> 01:23:54,788
What do you want,
a gentleman's agreement?

642
01:23:54,997 --> 01:23:58,171
I'll leave one node
out in the open. You take it.

643
01:23:58,375 --> 01:24:02,050
The other node and
the other ship are mine.

644
01:24:02,254 --> 01:24:03,346
Hey, wait, wait.

645
01:24:03,505 --> 01:24:07,510
What are we playing here,
retard bingo? What?

646
01:24:08,302 --> 01:24:10,179
That was on the table
from the start...

647
01:24:10,304 --> 01:24:12,147
Forget the start.

648
01:24:14,308 --> 01:24:17,027
It's the end you
want to think about now.

649
01:24:19,646 --> 01:24:21,114
See that?

650
01:24:24,985 --> 01:24:28,205
I'll give you till that
rain hits that station.

651
01:24:30,324 --> 01:24:31,951
That's your clock.

652
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,130
"Box Boy"...

653
01:24:56,183 --> 01:24:58,106
Dahl! Do it now!
Now!

654
01:25:14,660 --> 01:25:15,752
Again!

655
01:25:21,959 --> 01:25:23,427
He's not going down.

656
01:25:27,381 --> 01:25:28,724
Do it again, Dahl!

657
01:25:34,179 --> 01:25:35,772
Just go down.

658
01:26:28,484 --> 01:26:29,781
I got this, Dahl.

659
01:27:04,353 --> 01:27:05,445
Riddick.

660
01:27:05,854 --> 01:27:07,106
Riddick?

661
01:27:16,448 --> 01:27:17,791
Johns?

662
01:27:20,994 --> 01:27:23,463
We beating men
in chains now?

663
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:33,382
Okay, from the beginning.
For the historical record...

664
01:27:34,466 --> 01:27:35,513
<i>The Hunter Gratzner.</i>

665
01:27:35,592 --> 01:27:36,969
That's the commercial
vessel my son uses

666
01:27:37,052 --> 01:27:38,349
to transport you
back to the slammer.

667
01:27:38,428 --> 01:27:43,104
But that ship sends a distress
call somewhere near M-344/G.

668
01:27:43,350 --> 01:27:46,775
It's a backwater system, with
two suns, one habitable planet.

669
01:27:49,106 --> 01:27:51,234
Does he survive the crash?

670
01:27:52,317 --> 01:27:54,661
Big drama the next few hours.

671
01:27:55,445 --> 01:27:59,791
But whatever happens,
no matter what they tell you,

672
01:28:01,618 --> 01:28:03,586
don't let 'em take
these chains off me.

673
01:28:04,580 --> 01:28:06,503
Them? Who's "them"?
Who are you talking...

674
01:28:06,623 --> 01:28:08,591
Do you know who
you're talking to here?

675
01:28:13,088 --> 01:28:14,305
That was for me?

676
01:28:16,967 --> 01:28:18,389
When the chains come off...

677
01:28:18,468 --> 01:28:19,515
Jesus Christ.

678
01:28:19,636 --> 01:28:20,683
Box Boy,

679
01:28:21,638 --> 01:28:24,687
you go in
the first five seconds.

680
01:28:26,226 --> 01:28:27,352
Really?

681
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:30,989
And you plan on killing
me with what, your mouth?

682
01:28:31,940 --> 01:28:33,192
That shiny blade.

683
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:36,283
I'd love to see you try.

684
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:41,829
For the historical record,

685
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:44,752
he made it.

686
01:28:51,168 --> 01:28:52,886
So it's just you and him?

687
01:28:54,129 --> 01:28:55,301
Was, uh,

688
01:28:56,548 --> 01:28:59,301
about the same number
you see here in this room.

689
01:29:00,927 --> 01:29:02,895
So how many
made it off?

690
01:29:03,639 --> 01:29:04,811
Three.

691
01:29:06,391 --> 01:29:07,688
But not him?

692
01:29:09,686 --> 01:29:10,858
No.

693
01:29:11,563 --> 01:29:14,817
So between the time of the crash and
the time you leave that planet,

694
01:29:15,817 --> 01:29:17,319
my son dies.

695
01:29:17,736 --> 01:29:22,207
And I can safely assume it's at
your hands. Is that right?

696
01:29:25,243 --> 01:29:27,541
I'm wasting my
fucking time here!

697
01:29:30,332 --> 01:29:32,334
You grant any last wishes?

698
01:29:38,090 --> 01:29:40,058
I was referring to you.

699
01:29:40,967 --> 01:29:45,347
Not that the chains
aren't a hot look, but no.

700
01:29:46,556 --> 01:29:49,230
I'm not gonna straddle you
in front of all these guys.

701
01:29:49,309 --> 01:29:51,357
What if I killed
all of 'em first?

702
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:55,195
Easy, boy.

703
01:29:55,691 --> 01:29:58,444
There's a lot more tranq
where that came from.

704
01:30:00,404 --> 01:30:03,248
Tell me what you see
outside that window, Dahl.

705
01:30:14,418 --> 01:30:16,591
Cyclops unit, two ships,

706
01:30:17,003 --> 01:30:19,222
couple dead guys in plastic.

707
01:30:19,923 --> 01:30:21,641
And you don't see anything else?

708
01:30:21,842 --> 01:30:23,310
Nothing else.

709
01:30:23,844 --> 01:30:25,812
Let me know when you do.

710
01:30:27,764 --> 01:30:29,983
Love those toenails,
by the way.

711
01:30:32,310 --> 01:30:33,607
Yeah?

712
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:35,564
Predator Pink.

713
01:30:36,815 --> 01:30:38,112
Matches your nipples.

714
01:30:39,443 --> 01:30:42,572
Why are we even listening
to this big fuckstick?

715
01:30:43,155 --> 01:30:46,079
Can we just detach
his head, please?

716
01:30:47,033 --> 01:30:48,580
Here's what's gonna happen.

717
01:30:48,785 --> 01:30:49,877
The next 60 seconds,

718
01:30:49,953 --> 01:30:52,081
you're gonna watch your own
head drop into that box.

719
01:30:53,874 --> 01:30:55,046
Nothing,

720
01:30:55,876 --> 01:30:58,720
nothing is gonna keep you from
that special place in hell.

721
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:04,560
Maybe in the last minute of your
life, you want to be something more

722
01:31:04,634 --> 01:31:06,728
than a goddamn savage!

723
01:31:08,805 --> 01:31:10,899
Gimme some fucking answers!

724
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:13,230
Please!

725
01:31:22,527 --> 01:31:26,577
Is there anything you'd like to
add on the subject I just raised?

726
01:31:45,801 --> 01:31:47,178
Time's up.

727
01:31:53,558 --> 01:31:54,901
Time is up.

728
01:31:56,728 --> 01:31:58,446
He's all yours.

729
01:32:05,403 --> 01:32:06,996
Hold him down.

730
01:32:41,606 --> 01:32:43,153
More dingo-dongos maybe.

731
01:32:47,821 --> 01:32:49,118
Lucky.

732
01:32:52,492 --> 01:32:54,665
I know what's coming.

733
01:32:55,745 --> 01:32:59,249
Called to find you.
The serpents...

734
01:33:20,312 --> 01:33:21,564
spotlight!

735
01:33:48,673 --> 01:33:49,970
Like I said,

736
01:33:51,426 --> 01:33:53,929
it ain't me you
gotta worry about.

737
01:33:58,433 --> 01:34:00,606
What is it?
What's out there?

738
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:02,354
I don't know.

739
01:34:03,438 --> 01:34:04,940
Fucked up or
something out there.

740
01:34:05,565 --> 01:34:08,944
It ain't right.
It's coming our way.

741
01:34:18,036 --> 01:34:21,256
Whatever they are,
they ain't so hard to kill.

742
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:03,631
What the fuck?

743
01:35:24,686 --> 01:35:25,858
Fuck!

744
01:35:40,285 --> 01:35:42,253
No more holes, please.

745
01:36:16,321 --> 01:36:18,619
Now here's
what's gonna happen.

746
01:36:20,075 --> 01:36:22,954
In 60 seconds you're gonna
take these chains off me.

747
01:36:23,411 --> 01:36:26,756
We're gonna make a play for those
nodes and get off this rock.

748
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:31,924
But somewhere along the line,
when it gets really bad,

749
01:36:34,923 --> 01:36:36,095
Johns

750
01:36:37,926 --> 01:36:41,021
is gonna fold just
like Little Johns did.

751
01:36:42,931 --> 01:36:44,604
Then when it's all over

752
01:36:45,767 --> 01:36:48,566
and the rest of you are ready
for Dead Animal Pickup,

753
01:36:49,854 --> 01:36:52,607
I'm gonna go
balls deep into Dahl.

754
01:36:54,442 --> 01:36:56,911
But only because
she asked me to.

755
01:36:58,279 --> 01:36:59,781
Sweet-like.

756
01:37:02,575 --> 01:37:04,543
What does he mean,
"When things go bad“?

757
01:37:04,619 --> 01:37:06,542
What?
This doesn't qualify as bad?

758
01:37:07,539 --> 01:37:10,588
What the fuck is happening?
How fucked are we?

759
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,469
Who knows how
long it will rain?

760
01:37:15,004 --> 01:37:19,100
Or just how many of them
are buried out there?

761
01:37:21,219 --> 01:37:25,269
He saw it. He saw it with those eyes
of his and he didn't tell us what.

762
01:37:35,275 --> 01:37:38,404
One ship for you,
one for me.

763
01:37:39,279 --> 01:37:42,328
I need to know that these
nodes are retrievable.

764
01:37:44,033 --> 01:37:46,502
And I need to know
we have a deal.

765
01:37:50,915 --> 01:37:52,508
We got a deal.

766
01:37:59,883 --> 01:38:02,136
The chains stay on.

767
01:38:15,356 --> 01:38:17,279
Why don't we sit this one out?

768
01:38:20,278 --> 01:38:21,530
Okay. Okay.

769
01:38:23,239 --> 01:38:24,912
Up, up, up...

770
01:38:28,203 --> 01:38:29,625
Good doggie.

771
01:38:54,479 --> 01:38:55,480
Oh!

772
01:39:07,533 --> 01:39:09,706
Holy shit.

773
01:39:13,039 --> 01:39:14,086
Yeah.

774
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:17,085
Let's out him loose.

775
01:39:18,461 --> 01:39:20,259
That was five seconds.

776
01:39:21,089 --> 01:39:23,592
I like to be a man of my word..

777
01:39:26,135 --> 01:39:28,763
How about you, Johns?

778
01:40:14,309 --> 01:40:17,233
For He shall give His angels
charge over me, keep me in

779
01:40:17,353 --> 01:40:19,071
all His grace as long as I live.
Shut the noise, Luna.

780
01:40:19,355 --> 01:40:23,405
You know, I think the angels
are here protecting me.

781
01:40:24,068 --> 01:40:25,741
And if they're here,
watchin' over me,

782
01:40:25,820 --> 01:40:27,788
maybe they'll deliver us all
from this crazy, evil place.

783
01:40:27,864 --> 01:40:29,491
That shit is creeping everybody
out, so shut the fuck up.

784
01:40:29,574 --> 01:40:32,453
You shut the fuck up, Vargas.
Leave the kid alone.

785
01:40:40,335 --> 01:40:43,179
Where the hell did that... Jesus Christ!

786
01:40:44,422 --> 01:40:45,594
No, no, no!

787
01:40:48,343 --> 01:40:51,062
What the fuck is wrong with
you, you crazy bastard?

788
01:40:51,137 --> 01:40:52,389
You could have killed me!

789
01:40:52,472 --> 01:40:54,190
Got it, didn't I?

790
01:41:02,357 --> 01:41:03,950
Vargas, get up.

791
01:41:04,776 --> 01:41:06,870
Vargas, get up.
Come on, let's go.

792
01:41:07,236 --> 01:41:08,863
Vargas, come on, man.
Walk it off.

793
01:41:08,946 --> 01:41:10,539
Let's go.
It's just a little one.

794
01:41:10,865 --> 01:41:12,742
Small ones
are the worst.

795
01:41:14,369 --> 01:41:16,497
They save the most venom.

796
01:41:29,425 --> 01:41:30,642
And kid,

797
01:41:31,928 --> 01:41:33,851
leave God out of this.

798
01:41:34,097 --> 01:41:36,976
He wants no part of
what happens next.

799
01:41:47,944 --> 01:41:49,787
I forgot to mention,

800
01:41:51,322 --> 01:41:53,199
there's no weapons for you.

801
01:41:59,956 --> 01:42:01,924
You think you can ride
one of these things?

802
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,548
I'll ride it
like I stole it.

803
01:42:19,142 --> 01:42:20,735
I'll take flank.

804
01:42:31,654 --> 01:42:33,873
If Riddick comes
back here without us,

805
01:42:33,948 --> 01:42:37,043
you go ahead, you kill him
on general principle.

806
01:42:37,285 --> 01:42:40,334
Is that before or after
I'm supposed to fuck him?

807
01:45:12,523 --> 01:45:15,447
You asshole motherfucker!
Just sittin' there watchin'!

808
01:45:15,526 --> 01:45:19,247
Would have covered you,
but you said, "No weapons."

809
01:45:25,620 --> 01:45:28,464
How bad you want
those nodes, Johns?

810
01:46:04,283 --> 01:46:07,583
I don't suppose you took the
time to do this for him, huh?

811
01:46:09,747 --> 01:46:12,500
This may come as
a shock to you, Johns,

812
01:46:13,918 --> 01:46:15,886
but I didn't ghost your son.

813
01:46:18,005 --> 01:46:20,554
He seemed set on
killin' himself.

814
01:46:23,969 --> 01:46:25,846
What the fuck
does that mean?

815
01:46:26,597 --> 01:46:28,019
Morphine.

816
01:46:29,600 --> 01:46:31,193
Your son liked his morphine.

817
01:46:32,520 --> 01:46:34,443
Liked it twice a day.

818
01:46:35,314 --> 01:46:37,817
Didn't know your
son was a junkie?

819
01:46:41,320 --> 01:46:43,322
Johns was like most Mercs.

820
01:46:44,031 --> 01:46:47,331
They look all stand-up
and do-right

821
01:46:48,035 --> 01:46:50,879
until you out them open and
you find something missing.

822
01:46:51,872 --> 01:46:53,749
In his case, a spine.

823
01:46:55,626 --> 01:46:59,051
I don't have to listen to this shit!
That's not the man I knew.

824
01:46:59,213 --> 01:47:01,557
Then you didn't know your son.

825
01:47:06,679 --> 01:47:08,727
He wanted to kill a kid.

826
01:47:10,391 --> 01:47:12,234
To save his own skin.

827
01:47:12,810 --> 01:47:14,904
I had a problem with that.

828
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:18,198
You expect me to believe

829
01:47:18,733 --> 01:47:21,953
my son was gonna kill a child
to save his own life?

830
01:47:24,196 --> 01:47:27,791
Morphine makes
the brain soft. Heart weak.

831
01:47:31,579 --> 01:47:33,581
I don't fuckin' buy it!

832
01:47:33,998 --> 01:47:36,171
I just can't believe
that my son's the bad guy

833
01:47:36,250 --> 01:47:39,379
in this fuckin' demented
fairy tale of yours.

834
01:47:42,214 --> 01:47:44,137
No reason to lie now.

835
01:47:47,052 --> 01:47:48,224
Johns.

836
01:47:51,474 --> 01:47:52,976
Either one of us.

837
01:48:22,254 --> 01:48:24,723
Thanks for startin' the killing
spree for me, Riddick.

838
01:48:24,799 --> 01:48:26,676
But I'll take it from here.

839
01:49:19,311 --> 01:49:20,608
Jamoke.

840
01:49:25,609 --> 01:49:28,533
So that blade you buried
was meant for me?

841
01:49:30,030 --> 01:49:32,533
Anyone who
deserved it, really.

842
01:49:35,911 --> 01:49:37,288
We've got a problem, Riddick,

843
01:49:39,206 --> 01:49:41,800
because I've got
two nodes here.

844
01:49:41,876 --> 01:49:43,719
We've got one hog.

845
01:49:43,878 --> 01:49:47,974
And I sure as shit am not
ridin' bitch with you again.

846
01:49:50,259 --> 01:49:51,556
One hog?

847
01:49:53,053 --> 01:49:54,851
You sure about that, Johns?

848
01:50:00,769 --> 01:50:03,318
He pulled the goddamn
turbine pin!

849
01:50:04,815 --> 01:50:06,863
You just figured that out?

850
01:50:07,443 --> 01:50:10,913
Diaz was gonna take the nodes
for himself and ghost me.

851
01:50:11,405 --> 01:50:14,079
He was gonna leave
you out here alone.

852
01:50:14,575 --> 01:50:16,077
So what now?

853
01:50:23,459 --> 01:50:25,882
Now we switch to
our ground game.

854
01:50:27,421 --> 01:50:30,766
Let's see if that lack of
spine runs in the family.

855
01:51:22,810 --> 01:51:24,027
Reload!

856
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:32,032
Watch your head.

857
01:51:42,413 --> 01:51:43,505
Go!

858
01:53:46,787 --> 01:53:47,879
I got inbound.

859
01:54:03,220 --> 01:54:04,813
Take this!

860
01:54:05,139 --> 01:54:06,857
Is it just you?

861
01:54:07,766 --> 01:54:10,064
Just slam this thing in. See
if it's still good.

862
01:54:13,480 --> 01:54:14,481
BOSS...

863
01:54:14,565 --> 01:54:18,115
Just see if the fucking thing works!
We need to get outta here.

864
01:58:22,437 --> 01:58:25,907
Extraction, 30 seconds or less.
Let's go, let's go!

865
01:58:58,598 --> 01:59:00,441
Let me ask you somethin',

866
01:59:01,643 --> 01:59:03,441
sweet-like...

867
01:59:45,145 --> 01:59:46,988
<i>Lot of good
men died here, Riddick.</i>

868
01:59:47,397 --> 01:59:51,322
Not sure how I'm supposed
to overlook that. Next time.

869
01:59:51,693 --> 01:59:53,695
Yeah. Things would
have been different

870
01:59:53,820 --> 01:59:56,164
if they weren't trying
to put my head in a box.

871
01:59:58,867 --> 02:00:00,915
So where to now, Riddick?

872
02:00:01,578 --> 02:00:05,503
You know what? Fuck that.
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

873
02:00:06,333 --> 02:00:08,335
<i>I'll tell you this, Johns.</i>

874
02:00:08,710 --> 02:00:11,930
<i>Sooner or later,
we all have to head home.</i>

875
02:00:12,923 --> 02:00:15,142
<i>Tell Dahl to
keep it warm for me.</i>

876
02:00:15,926 --> 02:00:17,428
And, Johns,

877
02:00:18,678 --> 02:00:20,772
you keep a strong spine.

878
02:01:08,144 --> 02:01:09,145
Vaako.

879
02:01:12,148 --> 02:01:14,571
You are still alive.
Tell me where.

880
02:01:16,736 --> 02:01:18,579
He's no longer among us.

881
02:01:18,655 --> 02:01:21,659
Tell me,
and I'll kill him first.

882
02:01:22,242 --> 02:01:23,494
You misunderstand.

883
02:01:24,035 --> 02:01:26,584
Vaako is a decent man
who meant to honor his word.

884
02:01:27,581 --> 02:01:29,504
Even with you, strangely.

885
02:01:29,749 --> 02:01:31,422
I don't care about Furya.

886
02:01:31,501 --> 02:01:34,095
I don't care what the pact
was between you and him.

887
02:01:34,170 --> 02:01:36,468
This faith cannot
have a misbeliever

888
02:01:36,548 --> 02:01:38,016
or a kind heart leading it,

889
02:01:38,091 --> 02:01:41,140
and I have done what I have
done to ensure...

890
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:52,697
Too many words.

891
02:02:07,704 --> 02:02:10,048
Never lie to me,
I'll never hurt you.

892
02:02:13,752 --> 02:02:15,174
One word answer.

893
02:02:17,589 --> 02:02:19,057
Is Vaako alive or dead?

894
02:02:24,596 --> 02:02:25,597
Both.

895
02:02:48,745 --> 02:02:50,463
<i>Transcendence.</i>

896
02:02:51,305 --> 02:03:51,178
