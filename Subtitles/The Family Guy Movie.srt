1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:05,220
Live from Quahog, Rhode Island,
this is Channel Five Action News...

2
00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:08,061
...with Tom Tucker,
Diane Simmons...

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:12,968
...and Blaccu-weather meteorologist,
Ollie Williams.

4
00:00:13,072 --> 00:00:16,007
- Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.
- And I'm Diane Simmons.

5
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,134
Could we talk about something
besides yourself, Diane?

6
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:21,236
- Excuse me?
- Great. Tonight, in the news, two local men arrested...

7
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:23,316
...as part of an illegal
steroid ring.

8
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:25,977
These charges are false.
Our muscles are the result...

9
00:00:26,086 --> 00:00:29,453
...of hundreds of squat-thrusts and
somersaults down on the hard ground.

10
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:34,050
Stop pushing! Save your roughneck tactics
for Sacco and Vanzetti.

11
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:41,598
Hup! Hup-ho! Hup!

12
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:44,068
Meanwhile, authorities
acting on a tip...

13
00:00:44,171 --> 00:00:46,935
...searched the marshlands
near the Fox Point hurricane barrier...

14
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:49,236
...for what they believed
to be the remains...

15
00:00:49,343 --> 00:00:51,311
...of reputed mobster
"Big Fat" Pauly.

16
00:00:51,412 --> 00:00:54,575
The authorities were disappointed to find
not the remains of"Big Fat" Pauly...

17
00:00:54,682 --> 00:00:58,083
...but, instead, The Remains of the Day,
a boring Merchant-Ivory film...

18
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:01,848
- Starring Sir Anthony Hopkins.
- Hmm. Funny how they could've confused that.

19
00:01:01,955 --> 00:01:05,551
Coming up, why your next
trip to the salad bar could be your last.

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:08,356
But first, we go live
to the Quahog Performing Arts Center...

21
00:01:08,463 --> 00:01:11,694
...where Asian correspondent,
Tricia Takanawa is down at the red carpet.

22
00:01:13,802 --> 00:01:17,898
Tom, tonight the stars are out...

23
00:01:18,006 --> 00:01:21,464
...for a special sneak preview
of a straight-to-DVD feature...

24
00:01:21,576 --> 00:01:25,512
...that will soon be in the $3.99 bin
at your local car wash.

25
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:28,309
Here comes Mayor
Adam West, himself.

26
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:31,874
Mr. West, do you have
any words for our viewers?

27
00:01:31,986 --> 00:01:36,616
Box, toaster, aluminum, maple syrup-
No, I take that one back.

28
00:01:36,725 --> 00:01:39,853
- I'm gonna hold on to that one.
- Thank you, Mayor West.

29
00:01:39,961 --> 00:01:45,160
Oh, and if I'm not mistaken, it's
local folk legend and ward of the state...

30
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:48,395
Quahog's own
Greased-up Deaf Guy.

31
00:01:48,504 --> 00:01:52,406
Don't judge me! I'm just doin' my thing!
See you in the theater.

32
00:01:52,508 --> 00:01:54,908
- Evil, over here!
- Hey, Evil Monkey!

33
00:01:59,415 --> 00:02:03,112
And here come two popular
Family Guy guest stars...

34
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,551
Drew Barrymore
and her date.

35
00:02:05,654 --> 00:02:08,088
Hey, Kool-Aid!

36
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,158
- Oh, yeah!
- Things going well with Drew?

37
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,386
Oh, yeah!

38
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:16,261
We have so much fun
and he keeps my tongue really red.

39
00:02:16,365 --> 00:02:18,390
See?

40
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:24,867
Hey, thank y'all for coming out. Don't forget
to check out my clothing line, C.C. Brown...

41
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,534
...available
at many retail outlets.

42
00:02:27,643 --> 00:02:29,839
Got y'all in here.

43
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:34,679
And here are the stars of tonight's film,
the Griffin Family.

44
00:02:34,785 --> 00:02:36,980
Whoa! What's this,
a party?

45
00:02:37,087 --> 00:02:39,055
How'd you all get in my room?

46
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:41,784
Hi, I'm Brian.

47
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:44,520
Um, I rode backwards
in the limo, so...

48
00:02:44,628 --> 00:02:47,222
...uh, actually, my underpants were going
the right way.

49
00:02:49,399 --> 00:02:52,095
- Stewie! Stewie! Good to have you back!
- Good to be back.

50
00:02:52,202 --> 00:02:55,069
Especially since my brief
foray into politics didn't work out.

51
00:03:02,846 --> 00:03:06,942
Ladies and Gentlemen, we got him!

52
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:12,286
Stewie, I'm from TVGuide.
How does it feel...

53
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,415
...to be the youngest
working actor in Hollywood?

54
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:18,086
Well, it feels about like seven figures
a year, which feels pretty good.

55
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:20,187
Stewie! Stewie!
Hi, I'm from the L.A. Times.

56
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:22,562
Can you tell us, are you working
on any new projects?

57
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:24,692
Well, yes. I just did an episode of
According toJim.

58
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:26,702
I'm the comic relief.

59
00:03:26,804 --> 00:03:30,399
Stewie, do you know if Fox
has any plans to bring back Futurama?

60
00:03:30,508 --> 00:03:32,908
- What magazine are you from?
- Entertainment Weekly.

61
00:03:35,146 --> 00:03:38,946
— La, la, la, la
Family Guy —

62
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:41,382
H- H-Hey, everybody!

63
00:03:41,486 --> 00:03:44,512
- I am sorry. I am so sorry.
There was booze in the car.

64
00:03:44,622 --> 00:03:46,590
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:46,691 --> 00:03:48,818
Oh, God, Lois! For Christ's sake,
take it easy, will ya?

66
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:52,727
- When I heard-When I heard...
- God.

67
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:55,356
That we was gonna be in a
movie, I was like, "Fuck, yeah!"

68
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,061
All right. You know what?
Let's just try and walk straight here.

69
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,138
Just-

70
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,139
Lois, get up.
Oh, God. Lois, get up.

71
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:04,607
- Get on!
- I'm not gonna get on.

72
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:06,701
I am not gon- Lois. Lois.
You get up.

73
00:04:06,812 --> 00:04:09,042
- Peter.
- What?

74
00:04:09,147 --> 00:04:11,274
- Get on.
- Son of a bitch.

75
00:04:11,383 --> 00:04:14,011
I- I am really sorry, everybody.

76
00:04:14,119 --> 00:04:16,087
Oh, G- Oh! All right. You know what?

77
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:19,919
- Let's get inside. Come on.
- Ow!

78
00:04:20,025 --> 00:04:23,586
So, Meg, how does it feel
to be the center of attention?

79
00:04:23,695 --> 00:04:26,630
Oh, my God. You talkin' to me?

80
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:29,929
Are you talkin' to me?
Okay. Okay.

81
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:34,735
- Well, I thought a lot about it, and I-
- And here comes David Bowie.

82
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,072
- David, what brings you all the way to-
- Shh!

83
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:40,543
Just you shut
your mouth.

84
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,343
Oh, me love to meet
Ziggy Stardust!

85
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,646
I take you home. I make you fish bowel soup.
Fish bowel!

86
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:50,655
Thank you, Tricia, for setting
your people back a thousand years.

87
00:04:50,757 --> 00:04:53,692
And now we'll cut inside the theater
to our hidden cameraman...

88
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,318
...who'll be providing us
with a bootleg copy of the movie.

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

90
00:05:09,943 --> 00:05:13,208
Vince Vaughn, Susan Sarandon...

91
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,873
...in Two People Who Look
Like They Never Sleep.

92
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,042
Hey, Mary,
how'd you sleep last night?

93
00:05:18,152 --> 00:05:20,848
Ugh, I had plenty of sleep.
Stop asking me that.

94
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,923
- Well, you look tired.
- Well, so do you.

95
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,513
- Fine.
- Yeah.

96
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,327
I'm a little bunny and I'm separated
from my family.

97
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:39,770
Oh, no. I have a long
journey to go on.

98
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,898
I wish I didn't have to
go it alone.

99
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:44,637
Hey, Mr. Bear,
I need your help.

100
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:48,647
But I'm a loner bear who don't like to be
bothered by other folks.

101
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,980
A story of friendship,
with music by Randy Newman.

102
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:56,420
— It's a story 'bout friendship
with music by me —

103
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,049
— 'Bout a bear and a bunny —

104
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,721
— In the end the bunny's family dies
but the bear becomes his new family —

105
00:06:02,831 --> 00:06:05,061
— Something like that —

106
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,975
Whee!

107
00:08:35,086 --> 00:08:38,954
Mom, look! Mom! Mom!

108
00:08:39,056 --> 00:08:42,958
Mom! Mom! Mom, look at me!

109
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,518
Look at me!
Mom! Mom!

110
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:49,499
Mom!

111
00:08:51,003 --> 00:08:53,870
- How was that?
- Your third somersault was a little sloppy.

112
00:08:53,972 --> 00:08:55,940
But what do I know,
huh?

113
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,771
It's been so long since I qualified
for the Olympics.

114
00:08:58,877 --> 00:09:02,074
- You were in the Olympics?
- No, I got pregnant with Meg and couldn't go.

115
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:04,206
Now I'm pro-choice.

116
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,278
Hey! Hey, Meg.
Go crouch down behind Brian.

117
00:09:09,388 --> 00:09:11,754
- I'm gonna push him in the pool.
- Okay.

118
00:09:20,766 --> 00:09:23,462
- Dad!
- Ow! Damn it!

119
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:25,833
Meg, you did it wrong!

120
00:09:28,207 --> 00:09:30,676
See ya later, honey. I guess
I can't go swimmin' for half an hour.

121
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:32,677
Giggedy-giggedy-giggedy-goo!

122
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:36,146
Hey, Stewie. How 'bout
Daddy teaches ya how to swim?

123
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:39,241
Go... Away... Fat man.

124
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:41,877
What do you think you're doing?
"No" means "no"!

125
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,013
Okay. Here goes.

126
00:09:44,123 --> 00:09:47,650
Come on, Stewie. In... The... Pool.

127
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,094
No! No, I don't want
to die! I want to live! Live!

128
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:55,292
Peter, stop it.
He's never gonna learn like that.

129
00:09:55,401 --> 00:09:57,562
Maybe this summer
he should take swim lessons.

130
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,661
- Would ya like that, Stewie?
- Hmm.

131
00:09:59,772 --> 00:10:02,434
Well, I guess it couldn't be worse
than that summer I spent in India.

132
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,806
Whatever you do, short-round,
don't touch anything.

133
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:07,709
Okay, Dr. Jones, I no touch anything.

134
00:10:09,148 --> 00:10:13,449
- Indy!
- Lady only here 'cause she humping director.

135
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:19,551
Whoa. Look at this place.
What happened to Sal's Video?

136
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,527
We bought them out two weeks ago.
Welcome to Lackluster Video.

137
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,723
50,000 stores
nationwide.

138
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,733
Yeah, well, uh, you know, I used to come
into Sal's once or twice a week...

139
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:31,134
...to rent movies from his,
uh... Back room.

140
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:34,639
You know what I mean?
Room for, uh, adults only.

141
00:10:34,742 --> 00:10:38,439
Catch my drift? The, uh, kind of movies
where there are X-rated pornos...

142
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:41,673
...and fully-nude people fornicate
for the camera and stuff comes out.

143
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:43,943
- Get my meaning?
- Oh, I'm sorry, but Lackluster Video...

144
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:46,485
...takes a strong moral stance
against pornography...

145
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:48,578
...open-mindedness
and non-Christians.

146
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,556
Oh, yeah? Then why do you rent
Prince of Tides? Barbra Streisand is Jewish.

147
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,684
We edit some
of our movies.

148
00:10:53,795 --> 00:10:55,786
I think I'm in love
with you, Doctor.

149
00:10:55,897 --> 00:11:00,095
No, Tom, you're wrong. You don't love me.
You love the idea of me.

150
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,965
Hi, I'm Tom Tucker.
Do me a favor and fill this bag...

151
00:11:03,071 --> 00:11:07,098
...with motion pictures featuring
women-on-women or anything with an amputee.

152
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:11,372
Save your money, Tucker. This place doesn't
have porn. They think it's immoral.

153
00:11:11,479 --> 00:11:13,447
You know, that really
grinds my gears.

154
00:11:13,548 --> 00:11:16,984
Where in the Bible does it say a man
can't fire off some knuckle-children...

155
00:11:17,085 --> 00:11:19,713
...in the privacy of his own neighbor's
living room, while his neighbor is at work...

156
00:11:19,821 --> 00:11:21,982
...because I don't have
a DVD player?

157
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:24,820
I don't know where it says it because
the Bible is way too long to read.

158
00:11:24,926 --> 00:11:26,894
Hey, that was quite
a rant there.

159
00:11:26,995 --> 00:11:30,294
You know, we're looking for an everyman
to rant about petty, nonsensical irritants...

160
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,423
...to replace our "Spotlight
on the Middle East" segment.

161
00:11:32,534 --> 00:11:34,502
Hey! I'd be great at that!

162
00:11:34,602 --> 00:11:37,834
I've been dying to get back on television
ever since I stopped hosting Family Feud.

163
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,569
How are you, Betsy? Welcome to the show.
You are a lovely young woman.

164
00:11:41,677 --> 00:11:44,646
Stick my hand up there and feel that one.

165
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:46,806
And that one.

166
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:49,350
We're looking for somethin'
you shop for at the mall. Three seconds.

167
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:57,082
Come on, Stewie.
Don't be afraid.

168
00:11:57,193 --> 00:11:59,286
It's just water.
It's not gonna bite.

169
00:11:59,395 --> 00:12:02,125
Shut up! I know
it's not going to bite, stupid.

170
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:05,962
What a stupid thing to say. You drown in it,
you moron. It doesn't have to bite you.

171
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:09,504
Hey, little guy. Take a look at Brad
over there. He's my star pupil.

172
00:12:09,605 --> 00:12:12,472
- See how brave he is?
- He's not brave.

173
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:14,600
I'll tell you
who was brave- Gandhi.

174
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:17,679
And the black people
are always like, "Hey, bitch. "

175
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:21,649
And the Indian people,
we do not call our women in such a way.

176
00:12:21,752 --> 00:12:23,777
Boo.! You suck.!

177
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:26,685
Okay, parents. Next week's
the toddler's swim meet.

178
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,088
It's gonna be
a lot of fun!

179
00:12:30,527 --> 00:12:33,121
You know, that is a remarkable
resemblance, Brad.

180
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:37,326
You, on your back, in the water-
You look like one of my stools!

181
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:45,239
So, is it just pool water that turns you
into a sniveling girl, or is it all water?

182
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:48,004
Mom! Brian's asking me
if it's just pool water that turns me...

183
00:12:48,111 --> 00:12:50,136
...into a sniveling girl
or if it's all water!

184
00:12:50,247 --> 00:12:54,547
I heard that Olympic swimmers shave all
the hair off their head and their private areas...

185
00:12:54,651 --> 00:12:56,585
...to make 'em move faster.

186
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:58,620
I don't need some
stupid gimmick.

187
00:12:58,722 --> 00:13:03,456
Soon as I improve my technique, I'll outswim
Brad as easily as I took care of that other boy.

188
00:13:03,561 --> 00:13:07,190
Casper, go long!

189
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:10,461
Ooh, sorry about that, man.

190
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:12,468
- Are you dead?
- Yeah, whatever.

191
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:14,538
I was gonna off myself
on Tuesday anyway.

192
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,699
Hey, Peter, shouldn't you be getting ready
for your first news segment?

193
00:13:17,809 --> 00:13:21,040
Yeah. I'm a little nervous, though.
I'm not sure what to talk about.

194
00:13:21,145 --> 00:13:24,478
- You could talk about me.
- Okay, honey. I'll talk about you.

195
00:13:24,582 --> 00:13:28,712
"Hey, I'm Meg. I go to school.
I wear glasses. "

196
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,922
Spot on. Spot on.

197
00:13:35,026 --> 00:13:37,893
Oh, Peter, you'll be great.
You're a natural.

198
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:40,725
I always said they never
should have replaced you on Roseanne.

199
00:13:40,832 --> 00:13:42,892
Hey, Rosie,
have you seen Darlene?

200
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,806
...and junk.

201
00:13:50,909 --> 00:13:55,710
Uh, I-I don't, uh-
I can't, uh-What?

202
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,483
In other news, after several grueling days
of frightening uncertainty...

203
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:05,079
- I finally get my period.
- Well, Diane, I'm sure you and your brother...

204
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:08,353
...must be devastated by the loss of the
two-headed offspring that might have been.

205
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,396
We now go to Peter Griffin for
"You Know What Really Grinds My Gears?"

206
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:15,524
Thanks, Tom. You know
what really grinds my gears?

207
00:14:15,634 --> 00:14:18,967
Nobody's come up with a new
priest-and-rabbi joke in, like, 30 years.

208
00:14:19,071 --> 00:14:21,164
You know? I mean, okay.
Um, um-

209
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:24,140
A priest and rabbi go into the supermarket
and, uh, the priest...

210
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,439
...wants to buy a ham
and the rabbi says...

211
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,514
"Uh, I can't eat it.
It's forbidden.

212
00:14:28,615 --> 00:14:30,776
Couldn't eat it.
Not allowed. "

213
00:14:30,884 --> 00:14:33,352
Pigs are like superheroes to them.
Is it perfect? No.

214
00:14:33,453 --> 00:14:35,683
L- I don't see you
comin' up with anything.

215
00:14:35,788 --> 00:14:37,915
And that, people,
is what grinds my gears. Tom.

216
00:14:40,026 --> 00:14:41,994
Come on.
You gonna be all day?

217
00:14:42,095 --> 00:14:44,825
- I'm brushing my teeth.
- You only have, like, two.

218
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:48,025
- I mean, how long could- Oh, God!
- Oh. Hey.

219
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:51,262
Uh... wow.

220
00:14:51,371 --> 00:14:54,431
You... Doin' a little hair removal there?

221
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,374
Oh, uh-Yeah.

222
00:14:57,477 --> 00:15:00,935
Um... You know, feel free
to say "no" to this, but...

223
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:03,413
...would you shave
my coin purse?

224
00:15:09,323 --> 00:15:12,952
Oh, no! No way, man!

225
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,121
Holy freaking God!

226
00:15:17,231 --> 00:15:21,497
- Oh!
- Don't have to be so uptight about it.

227
00:15:22,736 --> 00:15:24,931
There we are.
Balder than Michael Chiklis-

228
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,906
And bears him an odd resemblance too.
I say, they could be brothers.

229
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,841
Detective Vic Mackey
has finally met his match.

230
00:15:30,945 --> 00:15:34,506
Just when you thought The Shield
couldn't get anymore intense.

231
00:15:34,615 --> 00:15:37,709
- Hey, Mackey, your brother's here.
- I'm sorry, Detective.

232
00:15:37,818 --> 00:15:40,912
- I don't have a brother.
- Hello, Vic.

233
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:44,923
Detective Scrotes. I told you
I never wanted to see you again.

234
00:15:45,025 --> 00:15:48,017
Yeah? Well, I got
a listenin' problem.

235
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:52,332
Okay. We're gonna have
our first fun little race.

236
00:15:52,434 --> 00:15:54,402
When I blow this whistle,
I want all the parents...

237
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:56,470
...to throw their children
into the pool.

238
00:15:56,571 --> 00:16:00,667
If your child doesn't resurface right away,
they're probably just trying to get attention.

239
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:02,800
- Ready?
- Good luck, Stewie.

240
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,708
"Good luck, Stewie. "

241
00:16:04,813 --> 00:16:06,246
That's you. That's what
you sound like.

242
00:16:06,348 --> 00:16:09,647
You're mine, Brad!

243
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:13,050
Damn, damn, damn,
damn, damn!

244
00:16:16,324 --> 00:16:19,225
Ew! A Band-Aid.

245
00:16:19,327 --> 00:16:22,296
I've got ya, sweetie.

246
00:16:28,637 --> 00:16:30,502
Good for you, Brad!

247
00:16:30,605 --> 00:16:32,631
- Oh, isn't he adorable?
- He's much better than my kids.

248
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,103
So, you think you can make me look like
a fool, do you? You little bastard!

249
00:16:38,214 --> 00:16:41,206
Well, guess again!

250
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:45,481
Oh, Brad! There's a piece
of marzipan over here for you.

251
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,920
What the deuce?

252
00:17:09,912 --> 00:17:12,904
Hell? Now, that's a bit much,
don't you think?

253
00:17:13,015 --> 00:17:16,076
I mean, sure, I've spent my entire life
trying to kill my mother. But who hasn't?

254
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:18,984
You know, really, for hell
this isn't that bad.

255
00:17:19,089 --> 00:17:21,182
- Hi, there. I'm Steve Allen.
- Oh, hello.

256
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:23,088
All right. Let's do this.

257
00:17:23,193 --> 00:17:26,492
Ah!

258
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:28,564
I'm alive. I'm alive!

259
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,792
Oh! Stewie! My baby.

260
00:17:30,901 --> 00:17:34,166
I thought I'd lost you.
Oh!

261
00:17:34,271 --> 00:17:37,240
I can't believe it. All these years
I thought I was living in hell...

262
00:17:37,341 --> 00:17:39,309
...but it gets so much worse.

263
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:41,639
This is a sign.
Well, from this day forward...

264
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:45,078
Stewart Gilligan Griffin
will be a good boy.

265
00:17:45,182 --> 00:17:48,151
I don't understand.
I was only gonna ask him to fix my collar.

266
00:17:48,251 --> 00:17:50,811
Huh. Well, I wonder
what they got on TV in hell.

267
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:04,335
Morning, Brian.

268
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:07,165
Beautiful day, isn't it?
Kind of day that makes you glad to be alive.

269
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:10,536
- I made fudge.
- Uh, okay.

270
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,745
Wha- Uh-
What, uh-

271
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:18,145
- What are you-What are you doing?
- Well, from the feel of it...

272
00:18:18,249 --> 00:18:20,410
...working through
quite a few years of stress.

273
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:23,646
The thing is, when I died,
I got a glimpse of where I was going...

274
00:18:23,755 --> 00:18:25,985
...and, well, I did not
like it one bit.

275
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:28,718
Wow. I am so
uncomfortable right now.

276
00:18:28,826 --> 00:18:30,817
So, I've resolved
to change my ways...

277
00:18:30,928 --> 00:18:32,919
...because I know now
who I want to be.

278
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,864
— I have confidence
in sunshine —

279
00:18:36,968 --> 00:18:40,097
— I have confidence
in rain —

280
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:43,299
— I have confidence
that spring will come again —

281
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:46,936
— Besides which, you see
I have confidence in me ——

282
00:18:47,045 --> 00:18:49,946
There you are.
Drink plenty of water.

283
00:18:50,048 --> 00:18:52,448
- Hey, Brian.
- Yeah?

284
00:18:52,551 --> 00:18:54,746
Thanks for listening.

285
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:57,754
Boy, that was more disturbing
than that cartoon I saw the other day.

286
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:05,857
Shh! Be "vewy," "vewy" quiet.
I'm hunting "wabbits. "

287
00:19:06,965 --> 00:19:08,933
Nyah, what's up, Doc?

288
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,698
Oh, God! Oh, God!

289
00:19:14,807 --> 00:19:18,038
Oh!

290
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:32,652
Shh! Quiet! Quiet!
Your father's on.

291
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:36,286
You know what really grinds my gears?
This Lindsay Lohan.

292
00:19:36,396 --> 00:19:39,126
Eh? Lindsay Lohan
with all those little outfits...

293
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:41,496
...jumpin' around there
on stage half-naked...

294
00:19:41,601 --> 00:19:43,660
...with your little outfits.

295
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,536
You're up there jumpin' around
and I'm just sittin' here with my beer.

296
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:50,040
So, you know,
what am I supposed to do?

297
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,543
What do you-What do you want?
You know, are we gonna go out?

298
00:19:52,645 --> 00:19:55,273
Is that what you're tryin'-
Why are you... Leapin' around there...

299
00:19:55,381 --> 00:19:58,350
...throwin' those things all up,
um, over there in my face?

300
00:19:58,451 --> 00:20:02,354
Huh? What do you want, Lindsay?
Tell me what you want!

301
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,720
Well, I'll tell you what you want.
You want nothin'.

302
00:20:04,825 --> 00:20:06,793
You want nothin'.
All right?

303
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:10,853
Because we all know that no woman
anywhere wants to have sex with anyone...

304
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:15,425
...and to titillate us with any thoughts
otherwise is just bogus.

305
00:20:15,536 --> 00:20:19,199
Oh! He is so right-on.
Women are such teases.

306
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:21,274
That's why
I went back to men.

307
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,744
Okay, Mom. Thanks for that.
See you later.

308
00:20:25,846 --> 00:20:27,871
Go on.

309
00:20:27,982 --> 00:20:31,577
Another thing that grinds my gears is
when I can't find the droids I'm lookin' for.

310
00:20:31,685 --> 00:20:33,846
Yeah, me too. What gives with that?

311
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:36,115
And that's what really
grinds my gears.

312
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,157
Clear.
Remove my microphone.

313
00:20:38,259 --> 00:20:40,227
- Great job, Mr. Griffin.
- Great job, Peter.

314
00:20:40,327 --> 00:20:42,295
- Just terrific.
- Just fantastic.

315
00:20:42,396 --> 00:20:44,729
Oh, this gig is even better
than that job I had...

316
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:47,324
...providing nighttime heat
for Lara Flynn Boyle.

317
00:20:47,435 --> 00:20:49,528
Thanks so much, Peter.

318
00:20:49,638 --> 00:20:51,663
- I was getting a little chilly.
- No sweat, Lara.

319
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,333
Hey, you have yourself
a fine sleep.

320
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:58,770
- Hey, Lara.
- Yeah?

321
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,680
- Is Dylan McDermott nice in person?
- Yeah.

322
00:21:02,784 --> 00:21:04,809
Good.

323
00:21:08,757 --> 00:21:10,884
So, who would like
to say the blessing?

324
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:13,222
No one? Okay.
I'll do it.

325
00:21:13,328 --> 00:21:15,387
Um, dear Lord...

326
00:21:15,497 --> 00:21:17,863
...we thank you for this food
we are about to eat...

327
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:21,697
...uh, thank you
for this gorgeous day...

328
00:21:21,803 --> 00:21:25,671
...and thank you for letting me share it
with my good friend, Brian-

329
00:21:25,774 --> 00:21:27,743
...that's you.

330
00:21:27,843 --> 00:21:29,811
Um...

331
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:32,210
...and that about covers it,
I guess.

332
00:21:32,315 --> 00:21:34,340
All right. Amen.

333
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,978
Sweetheart, I thought your "Grind My Gears"
segment was just wonderful tonight.

334
00:21:39,088 --> 00:21:41,352
Yeah! I can't believe
my father's famous.

335
00:21:41,457 --> 00:21:43,550
Well, honey, there's been
a lot of famous Griffins...

336
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:45,820
...like my great aunt,
Ella Fitzgerald Griffin.

337
00:21:45,928 --> 00:21:48,089
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

338
00:21:48,197 --> 00:21:50,358
I'd like to introduce
my accompanist for the evening...

339
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:53,333
...please say hello
to young Ray Charles.

340
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,413
I'm blind!

341
00:22:07,516 --> 00:22:11,248
- I feel ridiculous.
- Well, I can't very well fit you up here, can I?

342
00:22:11,355 --> 00:22:15,792
- Where are we going?
- Well, there is the most absolutely perfect...

343
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:18,122
...spider web in the bushes
by Cleveland's house.

344
00:22:18,228 --> 00:22:20,696
- You have just got to see it.
- Oh, for God's sake.

345
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,788
- Hey, Brian. Brian.
- What?

346
00:22:22,899 --> 00:22:24,992
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, come on.

347
00:22:25,102 --> 00:22:27,093
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

348
00:22:27,204 --> 00:22:30,970
Your friend, Stewie-
and he's always gonna be there for you.

349
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:36,344
- Yes. Table for two.
- I'm sorry. We have a 45-minute wait.

350
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:38,937
Oh, isn't that too bad,
honey?

351
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:42,143
Because I know waiting
in line at a restaurant...

352
00:22:42,252 --> 00:22:44,277
...really, uh,
grinds your gears.

353
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:46,356
Oh, my God! It's you!

354
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:49,425
I loved your rant about how bread is square
and baloney is round.

355
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:51,552
Oh, a table
just opened up.

356
00:22:51,663 --> 00:22:55,656
- Hey! We've been waiting.
- Shh! That's Michael Moore.

357
00:22:55,767 --> 00:22:57,735
Mr. Tucker,
we need this table.

358
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,803
But I've
already ordered.

359
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:03,465
Oh, we have a private
booth set up for you. This way.

360
00:23:03,574 --> 00:23:05,542
- Griffin.
- Diane.

361
00:23:05,643 --> 00:23:08,237
I can't believe we got a table
at the hottest restaurant in town...

362
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,314
...without a reservation.

363
00:23:10,415 --> 00:23:12,440
We really are
moving up in the world.

364
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,882
Yeah, but I'd love to see
what those private booths are like.

365
00:23:19,323 --> 00:23:23,692
This is totally unacceptable. How long
are you going to be? I'm very hungry.

366
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:30,196
Hey, B! Rupert and I
were just about to-

367
00:23:30,301 --> 00:23:32,394
E- E-Excuse me.
Did you just call me "B"?

368
00:23:32,503 --> 00:23:34,699
Yes, B. Rupert and I were just about
to dine on this mixture...

369
00:23:34,807 --> 00:23:36,775
...of Play-Doh
and rug hair.

370
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,843
- Care to join?
- Oh, no, thanks.

371
00:23:38,944 --> 00:23:41,139
I just thought you might
be interested in seeing this.

372
00:23:41,246 --> 00:23:44,647
This is the most absolutely perfectly
destroyed spider web.

373
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,877
- Where's the spider?
- Knock-knock.

374
00:23:46,985 --> 00:23:49,078
- Who's there?
- I ate him!

375
00:23:49,188 --> 00:23:51,554
You bastard! Who the hell
do you think you are?

376
00:23:51,657 --> 00:23:54,387
Ha! I knew it. I knew you hadn't
really changed.

377
00:23:54,493 --> 00:23:57,462
Okay. So, I was faking being nice.
It's not the worst thing I've done.

378
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:02,525
Ooh! Steve, it's coming
right at us. Grab it!

379
00:24:02,634 --> 00:24:05,194
- I don't wanna get in the way.
- It's a foul ball.

380
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:07,363
What harm can it do?

381
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:10,806
Look, I really don't want to go to hell,
but I can't fight my nature.

382
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,537
- I'm just a hateful person.
- You're not hateful.

383
00:24:13,645 --> 00:24:15,614
You just need to control
your anger like I do.

384
00:24:15,715 --> 00:24:17,683
You mean by being sauced all day?

385
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:20,275
Wait a minute.
Of course. That's it.

386
00:24:20,386 --> 00:24:23,981
If I'm drunk, I'll be calm. If I'm calm,
I'll be nice. If I'm nice, I won't go to hell.

387
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,456
Fix me a highball.
I'm going to get good and tight.

388
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,652
Look, you can't drink.
You're an infant, all right?

389
00:24:28,762 --> 00:24:30,787
Besides, there are better ways
to solve your problems.

390
00:24:30,897 --> 00:24:33,991
Oh, I suppose you're right.
Thanks, Brian. I was weak.

391
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,330
No problem.

392
00:24:40,073 --> 00:24:42,940
Oh, my God! Do you know
what it's time for?

393
00:24:43,042 --> 00:24:45,203
A sexy party!

394
00:25:03,063 --> 00:25:06,294
So, Brian, I-
Oh, what?

395
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,029
- I didn't say anything. - L-I thought-
Oh, I thought you interrupted me.

396
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:12,469
- Do-Don't interrupt me!
- Are you okay?

397
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:15,201
I'm as okay
as your face.

398
00:25:17,978 --> 00:25:21,709
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm s-sorry.

399
00:25:21,816 --> 00:25:25,115
So, honey, what are you
going to rant about today?

400
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:27,619
- Could we get a little preview?
- Oh, I got a good one, Lois.

401
00:25:27,721 --> 00:25:30,815
Parents who let their kids
do anything they want. I hate that.

402
00:25:30,925 --> 00:25:33,826
You know? Like, when I'm in a restaurant
tryin' to enjoy my dinner...

403
00:25:33,928 --> 00:25:37,955
...and little baby junior son-of-a-bitch
over there is screaming his head off.

404
00:25:38,065 --> 00:25:40,125
Parents need
to control their kids.

405
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:43,568
Hey! Everybody, look! I'm gonna do-
I'm gonna do something...

406
00:25:43,672 --> 00:25:45,697
...that's gonna freak you out.

407
00:25:45,807 --> 00:25:49,709
I'm gonna jump from this shelf
to my high chair.

408
00:25:49,811 --> 00:25:53,804
I'm gonna jump. You-
Are y-you watching? Are you? Are you?

409
00:25:53,915 --> 00:25:56,315
Stewie, don't interrupt.
It grinds my gears when you do that.

410
00:25:56,418 --> 00:25:58,409
Oh! He said it!

411
00:26:00,589 --> 00:26:02,784
You're gon-You're gonna-
You're gonna miss it.

412
00:26:02,891 --> 00:26:05,621
You're gonna miss it.
You're gonna miss it.

413
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:11,632
Oh, G- Oh, dude.!
Did you see th-that?

414
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:14,065
Did you guys-
Oh, man. Look at this-

415
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:17,161
Look at this gash. Look at this gash
right up the side of my leg.

416
00:26:17,272 --> 00:26:19,866
Oh-ho.! Oh.!
I cut myself deep.

417
00:26:19,975 --> 00:26:22,501
- Oh.! It doesn't hurt though.
- Uh, all right. Time for your nap.

418
00:26:22,612 --> 00:26:24,637
Don't worry, Lois.
I'll take him. Let's go.

419
00:26:25,915 --> 00:26:27,940
God.! What-
What the hell?

420
00:26:28,050 --> 00:26:30,177
Why are you drag-
Why are we in here?

421
00:26:30,286 --> 00:26:32,447
It's rude to the...
other people.

422
00:26:32,555 --> 00:26:34,523
- You're drunk.
- You're sexy.

423
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,785
Listen, you have to stop this, all right?
No more drinking.

424
00:26:36,893 --> 00:26:39,020
- I'm sorry I even put it in your head.
- I don't know.

425
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:41,722
I don't even know what your problem is.
I've never felt better.

426
00:26:41,831 --> 00:26:44,800
Okay, now I've never felt better.

427
00:26:49,005 --> 00:26:51,940
You know, Peter, there's gonna
be a lot of people watching tonight.

428
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:54,839
Better keep your balls
on the prize- Eyeballs-

429
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:56,969
On the ball.
Eyes on the ball.

430
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,343
Take two.
You know, Peter, there's gonna be...

431
00:26:59,448 --> 00:27:01,541
...a lot of people
watching tonight.

432
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:03,620
Better not screw up.
Use take two.

433
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,314
Don't worry about me, Tom.
I'll be fine.

434
00:27:06,423 --> 00:27:08,584
We're on in three,
two-

435
00:27:08,692 --> 00:27:11,252
And now it's time for "You Know What
Really Grinds My Gears?"

436
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,727
- With Peter Griffin.
- Thanks, Diane.

437
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,526
- You know what really grinds my gears?
- Hey! Hey!

438
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,999
Those X-ray specs you used to buy
out of the comics.

439
00:27:19,102 --> 00:27:22,037
- Hey! Screw up!
- I save up forever to buy these things...

440
00:27:22,139 --> 00:27:25,506
...and when I finally get 'em yesterday,
I couldn't see the inside of my son's belly.

441
00:27:25,609 --> 00:27:30,569
Blah! Bah! Blah!

442
00:27:30,681 --> 00:27:32,774
See, I wanted to see
if he'd eaten the last Nilla wafer...

443
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:34,851
'cause I told him
I wanted it.

444
00:27:34,952 --> 00:27:37,682
- Boy, I tell ya, that really grinds my gears.
- Pay attention to me!

445
00:27:37,788 --> 00:27:39,881
I'm trying to ruin you!

446
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,117
You wanted to see me, sir?

447
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:46,026
You're fired, Tom. Turn in your press pass
and any other studio property.

448
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,396
What are we doing here?

449
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:57,201
So, you like being drunk?
Fine. I'm gonna get you so drunk...

450
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:59,276
...you'll never wanna
drink again.

451
00:27:59,377 --> 00:28:02,107
Come on.

452
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,452
Cold. It's so cold.

453
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:19,022
- Thanks, Horace.
- Hey, is he 18?

454
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:22,031
- Horace, the drinking age is 21.
- Oh.

455
00:28:22,133 --> 00:28:24,931
O- Okay. Uh, uh...

456
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:27,027
...to the black man.

457
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:29,801
Thanks for taking
it all in stride.

458
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:39,046
— 'Cause suicide
is painless —

459
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:43,417
— It brings on
many changes —

460
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:46,616
— And I can take
or leave it —

461
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,422
— If I please ——

462
00:28:51,463 --> 00:28:53,397
Was that-
Was that good?

463
00:28:53,499 --> 00:28:55,831
Oh, God.
Thank you, man.

464
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:57,902
G- Get the fruit.
There's more points.

465
00:28:58,003 --> 00:29:00,335
- Get- Get the- Get the fruit.
- I'm not gonna get the fruit.

466
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,339
- Get the fruit.
- I can't get the fruit.

467
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:05,069
I'm not gonna get the fruit!
There's a ghost right there!

468
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,377
I can't believe
you saved all those.

469
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:13,077
L- Lois- L-Lois-
You think Lois'll like these?

470
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:15,814
- You love Lois!
- Shut up!

471
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:18,220
You know what?
Give me your keys.

472
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:21,020
- Oh, no. I'm fine.
- No, no. Give me your keys.

473
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:23,095
I'm fi-
I'm drivin'.

474
00:29:23,196 --> 00:29:25,164
- Give me your keys. You're too drunk.
- I'm okay.

475
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:28,996
Peter- Meg- Brian. You're too-
Brian, you're too drunk to drive.

476
00:29:29,102 --> 00:29:32,230
L- I-I a-am- I-

477
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,602
You're right. Here.
Here you go.

478
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:44,108
Shh!

479
00:29:44,217 --> 00:29:48,881
And that's it for sports. Now let's go to
Ollie Williams with Adopt-A-Pet of the week.

480
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:50,956
- Who wants this dog?
- Thanks, Ollie.

481
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:54,585
And now let's go to Peter Griffin
with "You Know What Really Grinds My-"

482
00:29:54,695 --> 00:29:57,186
Tom! What are you doing?
You don't work here anymore.

483
00:29:57,298 --> 00:29:59,596
Well, Diane, I have
an exclusive story-

484
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,895
And I can't figure out
how to check my e-mail from home.

485
00:30:02,002 --> 00:30:04,266
- Did you check your TCP/IPsettings?
- Yes, I did, Ollie.

486
00:30:04,371 --> 00:30:06,339
- Enable cookies?
- Yes, Ollie.

487
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,465
- You want this dog?
- No, thank you, Ollie. Roll tape.

488
00:30:08,576 --> 00:30:11,044
This was the scene
at the Drunken Clam last night...

489
00:30:11,145 --> 00:30:13,113
...as a car driven by
an intoxicated infant...

490
00:30:13,214 --> 00:30:15,182
...caused thousands of
dollars-worth of damage.

491
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,409
Put th-
Put this on my tab.

492
00:30:17,518 --> 00:30:19,918
It was- It was, like,
all slowed down.

493
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,387
You know? And I was, like, "Whoa!"
But I couldn't stop it.

494
00:30:23,491 --> 00:30:25,459
And who is the father
of the child in that car?

495
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,459
Ooh.! Tom.! Tom.!
I know this. I know this.

496
00:30:27,561 --> 00:30:29,756
Tom, over here. Tom!
Ooh! Ooh!

497
00:30:29,864 --> 00:30:34,062
The man you all respect so much.
Your beloved Peter Griffin.

498
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:36,535
Good thing he didn't call on me.
I was gonna say "Grant Goodeve. "

499
00:30:36,638 --> 00:30:40,870
Thanks, Tom. And now, neglectful father
and Quahog's newest social pariah...

500
00:30:40,976 --> 00:30:43,206
Peter Griffin, with another
segment of"Grind My Gears. "

501
00:30:43,311 --> 00:30:45,336
- Peter.
- Thank you, Diane.

502
00:30:45,447 --> 00:30:49,315
You know what really grinds my gears?
People in the 19th century.

503
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:51,851
Why don't they get
with the freakin' program?

504
00:30:51,953 --> 00:30:55,889
It's called an automobile, folks.
It's much faster than a horse.

505
00:30:57,125 --> 00:30:59,821
Oh. Well, it appears
I've been fired.

506
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:03,022
Well, as long as I'm no longer working here,
let me tell you somethin'.

507
00:31:03,131 --> 00:31:06,589
You know what really grinds my gears?
You, America.

508
00:31:06,701 --> 00:31:09,101
Fuck you! Diane.

509
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:13,364
Hey, Tom. Catch!

510
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,018
Did you miss Daddy?
Did you miss Daddy?

511
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:26,054
Oh, no. It's all right.
It's- Oh, you're shaking.

512
00:31:32,195 --> 00:31:34,891
- Go away.
- Huh. Little hung over?

513
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:37,557
I am never going
to drink again- Ever.

514
00:31:37,667 --> 00:31:40,192
I may have an occasional creme de menthe,
but that's about it.

515
00:31:40,303 --> 00:31:42,703
Look, kid, you can't stay in bed all-
Oh, God! You're nude!

516
00:31:42,805 --> 00:31:44,773
I am? What happened
to my clothes?

517
00:31:44,874 --> 00:31:48,241
Good Lord! What the hell
did I do last night?

518
00:31:48,344 --> 00:31:51,404
- I hope you learned something from all this.
- I certainly did, Brian.

519
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:53,482
It seems I'm still
finding myself.

520
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:56,677
Well, that's just life, Stewie. You gotta
help yourself. No one's gonna do it for ya.

521
00:31:56,786 --> 00:31:58,812
Yes, I suppose you're right.

522
00:31:58,922 --> 00:32:01,482
It's just too bad there's not someone
out there just like me...

523
00:32:01,592 --> 00:32:03,924
...who understands me well enough
to show me the way.

524
00:32:04,027 --> 00:32:07,019
Yeah. Stewie, I'm sure there's
someone out there just like you.

525
00:32:11,068 --> 00:32:13,696
Yes, I've reserved a non-smoking room
with a view of the bay.

526
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:17,035
No soap in the bathroom,
just moist towelettes and a sleep mask.

527
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:21,270
And, um, could you send up a bouquet
of orchids and a box ofToffifay?

528
00:32:21,378 --> 00:32:23,403
But, for the moment,
I've just got to accept the fact...

529
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,981
...that I'm an angry boy who'll occasionally
try to burn down a house...

530
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,244
...or toss a poison dart
at his mother.

531
00:32:28,352 --> 00:32:31,583
After all, I can't let one near-death
experience change my whole life, can I?

532
00:32:31,688 --> 00:32:33,747
I'm glad you finally
figured that out.

533
00:32:33,857 --> 00:32:36,087
Although, I will say, for the record,
you're a pretty fun drunk.

534
00:32:36,193 --> 00:32:39,094
Well, thank God there were
no long-term repercussions.

535
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:45,236
Oh! Got to play this one right, Roger.
Can't seem desperate.

536
00:32:45,336 --> 00:32:47,463
Wait three days-
that's the rule.

537
00:32:49,107 --> 00:32:51,337
Oh, God! I wanna
talk to him now!

538
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:54,968
Damn!

539
00:33:00,585 --> 00:33:03,281
Wow! This must be
one of them new plasma TV's.

540
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:05,720
- Would you like something to drink?
- I'll have water, please.

541
00:33:05,823 --> 00:33:07,791
I'll have water too,
but with lemon.

542
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:10,725
- I'll have a Sam Adams.
- It's 9:30 in the morning.

543
00:33:10,828 --> 00:33:13,058
And don't you have
an outstanding D.U.I.?

544
00:33:13,164 --> 00:33:16,327
Yeah, but I've gotta get the taste of weed
and hooker spit out of my mouth.

545
00:33:16,434 --> 00:33:18,459
I'll have a Sam Adams
too.

546
00:33:18,569 --> 00:33:21,595
Samuel Adams-
always a good decision.

547
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:24,540
Okay, now, if I get a fax, can I stay online
and still received the fax...

548
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:26,611
...without
a dedicated line?

549
00:33:26,712 --> 00:33:30,739
Yeah, you can put a piece of paper
in here and make, like, a phone call...

550
00:33:30,849 --> 00:33:34,945
...and your friend will get another piece
of paper with the same picture.

551
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,546
Can I possibly speak to someone who didn't
come to this country on a floating door?

552
00:33:38,657 --> 00:33:41,717
- Can I help you?
- Yes. We're here to replace our VCR.

553
00:33:41,827 --> 00:33:44,625
Yeah, don't try any
of your salesman funny business...

554
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,290
...like that guy who convinced me
to buy that pet Tyrannosaurus.

555
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,492
Okay, Patches,
now fetch!

556
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:55,128
Oh! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Drop it. Drop it. Drop it.

557
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,674
Ew. It's got spit
all over it.

558
00:33:57,776 --> 00:34:00,336
A VCR? Let me show you
something.

559
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:02,414
It's called TiVo.
It always records what your watching...

560
00:34:02,514 --> 00:34:04,482
...so, you can re-watch
anything you missed.

561
00:34:04,583 --> 00:34:06,984
Oh! Sounds fancy.
How does it work?

562
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,521
I'll tell ya how it works.
Easy as pie, is how it works.

563
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,955
I'll tell ya how it works.
Easy as pie, is how it works.

564
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,028
- Should I ring it up?
- Hold on. Hold on.

565
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:18,097
I think we should
discuss it first.

566
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,764
Some kind of palsy.

567
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:24,837
Anyway, that's how
I saved Christmas.

568
00:34:24,938 --> 00:34:26,963
Yeah, go ahead
and bag this thing for us.

569
00:34:31,344 --> 00:34:34,336
Ah! Sweet, Quagmire.
You got a Winnebago.

570
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:36,677
You mean a
"Wanna-bang-o"!

571
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,751
How clever.

572
00:34:38,852 --> 00:34:40,820
Yeah, I'm gonna take her
across the country...

573
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,888
...and bang a different broad
in every state.

574
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:45,219
- Also, gonna go to Vegas.
- Oh, we went to Vegas once.

575
00:34:45,325 --> 00:34:47,294
Remember, Lois? We saw
theJew Man group?

576
00:34:51,565 --> 00:34:53,556
Dad, what are you doing?

577
00:34:53,667 --> 00:34:56,363
I'm fast-forwarding through this pesky
TV show so I can get to the commercials.

578
00:34:56,470 --> 00:34:59,200
Hi, I'm Wilford Brimley
and I have diabetes.

579
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:02,742
It hurts me to pee and it causes me
to be short with my family.

580
00:35:02,843 --> 00:35:04,868
I can't sleep at night.

581
00:35:04,979 --> 00:35:07,641
The other day, I stubbed my toe
and took it out on the dog.

582
00:35:07,748 --> 00:35:11,582
Two weeks ago, I ran out of vanilla
ice cream and struck my wife.

583
00:35:11,685 --> 00:35:14,449
Then I find out my wife's
been dead for six years.

584
00:35:14,555 --> 00:35:16,580
Who the hell did I hit?

585
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:22,658
Lunch is ready!
Come and get it!

586
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:24,924
Hey, what do you think it is,
boogers on a biscuit?

587
00:35:25,032 --> 00:35:28,559
That's prob-That's probably what it is.

588
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,831
We now go live to
the streets of San Francisco...

589
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:33,271
...with Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa.

590
00:35:33,375 --> 00:35:36,276
- Diane, is she Chinese orJapanese?
- She's Japanese, Tom.

591
00:35:36,378 --> 00:35:38,505
Wow.
I know a Japanese woman.

592
00:35:38,613 --> 00:35:41,309
Tom, I'm standing here
amidst the heated debate...

593
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:44,044
...over a recent petition
to change the name of the city...

594
00:35:44,152 --> 00:35:48,145
...from San Francisco
to something a little less gay.

595
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:51,919
Excuse me, sir. What would
you like to rename San Francisco?

596
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:55,724
Well, given the wonderful shoe shopping,
I would cast my vote for "Heaven. "

597
00:35:55,831 --> 00:35:57,731
- Who the hell was that?
- What?

598
00:35:57,833 --> 00:36:00,097
I say, press the button.
Make it stop. Oh, my God.

599
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:02,898
- He looks just like me.
- You know what? He does.

600
00:36:03,004 --> 00:36:06,599
- Almost looks like he could be your father.
- He could be my father.

601
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,801
My real father.
I knew it!

602
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:11,504
Lois must have mated
with this poor fellow.

603
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:13,514
I've got to get out
to California.

604
00:36:13,616 --> 00:36:15,948
I dare say, I'd fit right in
with the kids from 90210-

605
00:36:16,052 --> 00:36:18,179
...even the older-looking
one.

606
00:36:19,622 --> 00:36:21,817
Boy, that test
sure is gonna be hard tomorrow.

607
00:36:21,924 --> 00:36:24,688
You said it, Donna.
Hey, Andrea, can you help me study?

608
00:36:24,794 --> 00:36:27,388
- What?
- I said, "Can you help me study?"

609
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:29,829
Dylan, I fixed
your socks.

610
00:36:29,932 --> 00:36:32,230
Hey, Andrea, are we still goin'
to the concert?

611
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:37,329
This used to be all orange groves,
far as the eye could see.

612
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,408
Okay. So, I'll
pick you up at 7:00.

613
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:44,242
Barbara Stanwyck and I
used to take the trolley.

614
00:36:44,347 --> 00:36:47,441
Hey, Lois.! Thought you might
be in the mood for a classic.

615
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:51,919
— Na-na, na-na, na-na, na-na Na-na,
na-na, na-na, na-na Spider-Man —

616
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:54,183
— Spider-Man —

617
00:36:54,291 --> 00:36:56,657
— Here comes Peter on the clothesline
but his name's not Peter —

618
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,126
— It is Spider-Man
Spider-Man —

619
00:36:59,229 --> 00:37:01,754
— Come on, Lois Let's get busy,
maybe in the garden right here —

620
00:37:01,865 --> 00:37:04,698
— Spider-Man
Spider-Man —

621
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:07,463
— Touch my can with your hand
Spider-Man —

622
00:37:07,571 --> 00:37:10,506
Oh! Help! Spider-Man.

623
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:12,837
I'm being attacked
by the evil rosebush.

624
00:37:12,943 --> 00:37:14,911
Ah! I'll save you,
MaryJane!

625
00:37:18,682 --> 00:37:21,082
- Oh, my God!
- I don't know what they're fighting about...

626
00:37:21,184 --> 00:37:23,311
...but I think Dad's winning.

627
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,184
- Go, Dad!
- Kids, can we have some privacy, please?

628
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,623
Yeah, you guys are more annoying than
that announcer on those TV commercials.

629
00:37:29,726 --> 00:37:31,853
Wacky, waving,
inflatable-arm-flailing tube man.!

630
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:34,226
Wacky, waving,
inflatable-arm-flailing tube man.!

631
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:36,300
Wacky, waving,
inflatable-arm-flailing tube man.!

632
00:37:36,401 --> 00:37:39,199
Hi, I'm Al Harrington, president
and C.E.O. Of Al Harrington's...

633
00:37:39,304 --> 00:37:42,831
Wacky, Waving, Inflatable-Arm-Flailing
Tube Man Emporium and Warehouse.

634
00:37:42,941 --> 00:37:45,466
Thanks to a shipping error,
I am now currently overstocked...

635
00:37:45,577 --> 00:37:48,011
...on wacky, waving
inflatable-arm-flailing tube men...

636
00:37:48,112 --> 00:37:50,672
...and I am passing
the savings on to you!

637
00:37:50,782 --> 00:37:53,910
Attract customers to your business,
make a splash at your next presentation...

638
00:37:54,018 --> 00:37:57,078
...keep Grandma company, protect your crops,
confuse your neighbors.

639
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:01,488
African-American? Hail a cab,
testify in church orjust raise the roof.

640
00:38:01,593 --> 00:38:04,858
Whatever your wacky, waving
inflatable-arm-flailing tube man needs are.

641
00:38:04,963 --> 00:38:06,954
So, come on down
to Al Harrington's...

642
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:09,499
Wacky, Waving Inflatable-Arm-Flailing
Tube Man Emporium and Warehouse.

643
00:38:09,601 --> 00:38:12,035
Route 2 in Weekapaug!

644
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:17,807
Please forgive me, Mr. Oinkbaum.
You will be missed.

645
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:19,878
- There we are.
- What are you doing?

646
00:38:19,979 --> 00:38:21,913
None of your bees wax,
Ramona.

647
00:38:22,014 --> 00:38:25,108
But if you must know, I need a plane ticket
to San Francisco.

648
00:38:25,217 --> 00:38:27,549
Good luck.
Plane tickets are about 450 bucks.

649
00:38:27,653 --> 00:38:30,144
400- Brian,
hit me in the mouth.

650
00:38:30,255 --> 00:38:32,883
- What? Why?
- I hear this Tooth Fairy gives you money for your teeth.

651
00:38:32,992 --> 00:38:34,983
- Have at it.
- Uh, okay.

652
00:38:35,094 --> 00:38:37,062
No, no! Don't, don't, don't!
Stop. Stop.

653
00:38:37,162 --> 00:38:39,130
- Why did you stop? I said, "Hit me. "
- You flinched.

654
00:38:39,231 --> 00:38:41,222
Well, of course I flinched.
You were going to hit me.

655
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:43,563
- Well, make up your mind. What do you want me to do?
- Hit me.

656
00:38:43,669 --> 00:38:45,637
No, no. D-Don't.

657
00:38:45,738 --> 00:38:47,968
I'm sorry. Look, I know I'm being
hard to read-

658
00:38:55,848 --> 00:38:58,646
Hey! You there!
Buy this yellow drink.

659
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:02,279
Hey, preggo. Preggo.
Hey, I'm talkin' to you, tubby.

660
00:39:02,389 --> 00:39:04,823
Oh, don't you ignore me.
Ooh!

661
00:39:04,924 --> 00:39:07,893
Pardon me, sir. Sir? Sir?
Oh, the hell with this.

662
00:39:11,564 --> 00:39:14,397
So, we had to do it
the hard way, hmm?

663
00:39:14,501 --> 00:39:17,959
Six bucks?
Nice-looking wife you've got.

664
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:20,437
Maybe I'll look her up
while you're in the hospital.

665
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:23,065
Don't forget
your lemonade.

666
00:39:26,446 --> 00:39:28,539
Oh, there you are.
I thought you should-

667
00:39:28,648 --> 00:39:30,707
- What are you doing?
- Paying bills.

668
00:39:30,817 --> 00:39:33,251
- What bills? You have bills?
- Well, there's cable and-

669
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:36,914
- Peter pays for the cable!
- It's at this, uh- It's at this girl's house.

670
00:39:37,023 --> 00:39:39,719
- Do you want something?
- Yes. I'm still short for my trip.

671
00:39:39,826 --> 00:39:43,456
I've only got $200. I suggest you pony up
the difference immediately...

672
00:39:43,564 --> 00:39:46,590
...or I'll e-mail the contents
of your hard drive to the F.B.I.

673
00:39:46,701 --> 00:39:48,726
What are you talking about?
There's nothing on there.

674
00:39:52,707 --> 00:39:55,676
Stewie, why is it so hard to accept
that Peter's your real father?

675
00:39:55,776 --> 00:39:57,767
Because he's an idiot.

676
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:59,846
You remember that time
he went to the Today show.

677
00:39:59,947 --> 00:40:02,848
Coming up on Today. Tom Cruise has
a new movie. We're gonna be talking to him.

678
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,850
Katie.

679
00:40:04,952 --> 00:40:07,853
- Funnyman Al Franken will be stopping by for a visit.
- Katie!

680
00:40:07,955 --> 00:40:10,856
- And Wolfgang Puck shares his recipe for apple strudel.
- Katie!

681
00:40:10,958 --> 00:40:14,917
So stay tuned because we've got all this
and more coming up in the next hour.

682
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:16,929
Katie!

683
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,999
- What?
- Oh, well, never mind.

684
00:40:21,602 --> 00:40:24,332
- Care to join me, Lois?
- Ah!

685
00:40:24,438 --> 00:40:28,170
Uh, Peter, how am I supposed to-

686
00:40:28,276 --> 00:40:32,770
- Oh, oh, oh. Sorry. Sorry. Where are my manners?
- Oh, What a gentleman.

687
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,046
There ya go.

688
00:40:37,152 --> 00:40:40,553
- Oh! Oh, God. You okay, honey?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

689
00:40:40,655 --> 00:40:42,850
Oh, this is nice.

690
00:40:42,958 --> 00:40:47,793
Mom, Meg says Omar Sharif is dead,
but I think she's thinkin' of Anthony Quinn.

691
00:40:47,896 --> 00:40:50,194
Chris, your father and I
are in the tub.

692
00:40:50,298 --> 00:40:52,892
And, Meg, you are thinking
of Anthony Quinn. Now, get out!

693
00:40:53,001 --> 00:40:56,198
Peter, this is ridiculous.
We have no privacy here.

694
00:40:56,304 --> 00:40:58,670
We gotta get those kids
outta the house once in a while.

695
00:40:58,774 --> 00:41:01,675
- Shouldn't they be dating?
- Aw, that doesn't solve the problem, Lois.

696
00:41:01,777 --> 00:41:04,905
If they start datin', I mean,
their rooms are right next to each other.

697
00:41:05,013 --> 00:41:07,505
They'll start havin' sex.
We'll never get 'em outta the house.

698
00:41:07,617 --> 00:41:11,178
No, no, you idiot. I'm talking
about them dating other people.

699
00:41:11,287 --> 00:41:13,619
Look, I'm gonna start
spending some time with Chris...

700
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:15,987
...and I'll show him
how to attract a woman.

701
00:41:16,092 --> 00:41:18,219
Yeah, and I'll spend
some time with Meg.

702
00:41:18,327 --> 00:41:20,420
I've spent lots
of time with her...

703
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:22,794
...like when we went on our last crusade
to find the Holy Grail.

704
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:26,164
- Choose wisely.
- Uh, I choose this one.

705
00:41:26,269 --> 00:41:28,362
- How did you know?
- Well, I kinda figured...

706
00:41:28,471 --> 00:41:30,439
...the coffee mug
that says "Jesus. "

707
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,065
- Oh, right. Right.
- Pretty obvious.

708
00:41:33,176 --> 00:41:35,144
Great. Let's kiss on it.

709
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,610
Come here, you.

710
00:41:40,383 --> 00:41:43,648
Oh! You bleedin'? Yeah, you're bleedin'.

711
00:41:45,788 --> 00:41:47,756
Don't tell me you're goin'
to California on that.

712
00:41:47,857 --> 00:41:50,258
Bicycling is hard,
but it has its benefits.

713
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,887
Did you know Lance Armstrong
is dating Sheryl Crow?

714
00:41:53,997 --> 00:41:56,898
You know, it really speaks to her character
that she can get past...

715
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,968
...the whole
"he had cancer" thing...

716
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:01,162
...and still find him
sexually attractive.

717
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:03,671
Really speaks to her character.
L- I respect that.

718
00:42:03,774 --> 00:42:05,799
Hey, Brian, what do
ya think of my sign?

719
00:42:05,909 --> 00:42:09,743
"Quagmire's Cross-country Tour. "
Uh, isn't there an "O" in "country"?

720
00:42:09,847 --> 00:42:13,146
Nope. Look out, California.
Here I come.

721
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,275
California!

722
00:42:15,385 --> 00:42:17,410
- What are you doing?
- Well, you heard Captain Syphilis.

723
00:42:17,521 --> 00:42:20,786
- We're going to California.
- Oh, come on. You can't go alone with Quagmire.

724
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:25,225
Look, I'll tell you what. If you're serious
about this, I'll go with you.

725
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:27,354
Although I should probably
ask Peter and Lois if it's okay.

726
00:42:27,464 --> 00:42:30,194
Oh, they won't even know we're gone.

727
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:33,031
Damn you, vile woman!
Blast! What the deuce?

728
00:42:33,137 --> 00:42:35,765
I am a tool. Stewie is much better
than me at everything...

729
00:42:35,874 --> 00:42:37,899
...including arts and crafts
and the guitar.

730
00:42:38,009 --> 00:42:40,034
I have no friends.

731
00:42:40,144 --> 00:42:43,773
- Glad you guys are joinin' me.
- Did you guys see Three Men and a Baby?

732
00:42:43,882 --> 00:42:46,942
- Yeah.
- There's a ghost in there behind the window.

733
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:49,144
That's an urban legend.
It's just a piece of cardboard.

734
00:42:49,254 --> 00:42:52,246
- No, it's a ghost. I heard.
- You heard from who?

735
00:42:52,357 --> 00:42:54,348
- From, uh... Lois.
- Yeah, right.

736
00:42:54,459 --> 00:42:56,427
- Cleveland? Death?
- No. No.

737
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:58,552
- Greased-up Deaf Guy?
- He said that?

738
00:43:05,399 --> 00:43:07,765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

739
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,229
Ow! Damn it!

740
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:14,501
- What are you doing?
- Your knight was at king's rook six.

741
00:43:14,609 --> 00:43:17,669
No, my bishop was at king's rook six.
My knight was at queen five.

742
00:43:17,779 --> 00:43:19,747
- No, no, no. It was-
- Yes. Yes.

743
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,872
No. In your dreams
your knight was at queen five.

744
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,951
- I was sitting right-
- I saw right-

745
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:26,020
- Yeah-
- Oh! Look at that! Look at that!

746
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,088
Now your knight
is at refrigerator five.

747
00:43:28,189 --> 00:43:31,022
- That's real mature.
- Yeah, well, who comes out a winner? Me.

748
00:43:31,125 --> 00:43:35,494
Griffin once again.

749
00:43:35,596 --> 00:43:38,121
Undefeated champion of the world!

750
00:43:43,171 --> 00:43:45,867
You know, San Francisco
is a big place.

751
00:43:45,973 --> 00:43:48,066
Have you thought about
how you're gonna find this guy?

752
00:43:48,176 --> 00:43:50,770
Simple, Brian.
Look at this.

753
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,012
My God! This poor fellow
had relations with Lois.

754
00:43:56,118 --> 00:43:58,678
That's more disgusting
than my cousin Quark Griffin.

755
00:43:58,787 --> 00:44:03,349
I'm watching your every move, Quark, so don't
think you can get away with any law-breaking.

756
00:44:03,459 --> 00:44:05,484
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever, man.
- I mean it!

757
00:44:05,594 --> 00:44:07,824
- You'll have me to deal with.
- Ooh! I'm really scared.

758
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,398
I could morph into
a giant python and eat you alive.

759
00:44:10,499 --> 00:44:12,399
Hey, here's an idea-

760
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:15,402
Why don't you morph into a guy
with something interesting to talk about?

761
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:21,499
Kids, your mother and I have decided we're
gonna help you two get out in the dating world.

762
00:44:21,610 --> 00:44:23,168
That's right.

763
00:44:23,278 --> 00:44:26,179
Chris, I'm gonna show you how to be
an affable, desirable young man...

764
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:28,181
...who doesn't smell like
the inside of a wool hat.

765
00:44:28,283 --> 00:44:31,184
- Why you gotta break balls?
- Meg, when I get through with you...

766
00:44:31,286 --> 00:44:33,880
...you're gonna be beatin' guys off
with both hands.

767
00:44:33,989 --> 00:44:36,890
- This is gonna be so fun!
- Hey! Zip it.

768
00:44:36,992 --> 00:44:41,487
Rule number one:
No speakee until the man speakee to you.

769
00:44:45,435 --> 00:44:47,335
I say,
are we moving on yet?

770
00:44:47,437 --> 00:44:49,871
Just hang out, little guy.
I'll see you in a while.

771
00:44:49,973 --> 00:44:53,101
Oh, very well. I suppose I'll go
pump the chemical toilet.

772
00:44:53,209 --> 00:44:55,643
Apparently
you're about to do the same.

773
00:44:58,081 --> 00:45:00,572
What the hell
is taking him so long?

774
00:45:00,683 --> 00:45:02,913
I'm missing precious time
with my father.

775
00:45:03,019 --> 00:45:05,487
Which one of these
is the horn?

776
00:45:05,588 --> 00:45:07,351
That's not it.

777
00:45:07,457 --> 00:45:09,254
That's not it
either.

778
00:45:10,593 --> 00:45:13,892
- Do something.
- I'm afraid to press anything else.

779
00:45:15,198 --> 00:45:17,928
Okay, Meg, lesson one
for attracting a man.

780
00:45:18,034 --> 00:45:21,402
- I want you to shave my back.
- Eew! Why would I want to do that?

781
00:45:21,505 --> 00:45:26,101
Trust me, Meg. Shave a man's back for him
and he'll purr like a walrus.

782
00:45:30,948 --> 00:45:33,849
All right, Chris, now that we've talked
about kissing and cuddling...

783
00:45:33,951 --> 00:45:36,681
...it's time to practice
eating out...

784
00:45:36,787 --> 00:45:38,812
...at a fancy restaurant!

785
00:45:44,261 --> 00:45:46,286
All right, that's it.

786
00:45:46,397 --> 00:45:49,298
Listen, you pervert,
what the devil is taking so lo-

787
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:51,732
- Good lord!
- Oh, Stewie. Thank God.

788
00:45:51,836 --> 00:45:54,498
That cleaning lady cleaned me out.
She took all my money.

789
00:45:54,605 --> 00:45:56,630
Grab those keys
over there, will ya?

790
00:45:56,740 --> 00:45:58,640
What, these keys?
These keys here?

791
00:45:58,742 --> 00:46:00,573
These the ones you want?
Hmm?

792
00:46:00,678 --> 00:46:02,510
Up yours!

793
00:46:06,718 --> 00:46:09,619
What the hell are you doing?
Where's Quagmire?

794
00:46:09,721 --> 00:46:12,519
- He said to go without him.
- We're stealing the Winnebago, aren't we?

795
00:46:12,624 --> 00:46:14,592
Oh, you can read me
like a book, Brian.

796
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:16,593
Breaker-breaker, Sidewinder.
This is Party Pooper.

797
00:46:16,695 --> 00:46:18,595
Don't want to be
a ratchet jaw...

798
00:46:18,697 --> 00:46:21,359
...but looks like we've got a seat cover feeding
the bears in a chicken coop, come on.

799
00:46:31,343 --> 00:46:33,243
Dad, why are we
just sitting here?

800
00:46:33,345 --> 00:46:35,245
Just give me
a minute, Meg.

801
00:46:35,347 --> 00:46:38,680
- What am I supposed to be
learning about dating from... Ahh.

802
00:46:38,783 --> 00:46:41,183
Oh, my God, Dad!
You farted!

803
00:46:41,286 --> 00:46:44,188
- That is so nasty!
- No! No, no, Meg!

804
00:46:44,290 --> 00:46:46,190
Meg, this is crucial.
All right?

805
00:46:46,292 --> 00:46:50,092
The sexiest thing a woman can do
for a man is learn to love his gas.

806
00:46:50,196 --> 00:46:52,096
Love the gas, Meg.
Love it!

807
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,600
No, Meg! No, no!
This is why we're here.

808
00:46:56,702 --> 00:46:59,102
This is why we're here.
This is why we're here.

809
00:47:00,706 --> 00:47:03,607
Chris, you've gotta learn
how to talk to girls.

810
00:47:03,709 --> 00:47:08,043
So I'll ask you again: What are the names
of the women on Sex and the City?

811
00:47:08,147 --> 00:47:11,139
Uh... Carrie...

812
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,480
Miranda, uh...

813
00:47:13,586 --> 00:47:16,180
Samantha and...

814
00:47:16,289 --> 00:47:18,951
...uh, Scrappy-Doo?

815
00:47:19,058 --> 00:47:21,219
- Hit him, Endo.
- Aaah! Aaah! Aah!

816
00:47:21,327 --> 00:47:24,125
Bosley? Uh, Tootie?
Uh, Sheena Easton?

817
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:26,199
Aaah! Aaah!

818
00:47:27,801 --> 00:47:29,894
Think we should
go back for Quagmire?

819
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:32,130
He'll be all right.
He's resourceful.

820
00:47:36,843 --> 00:47:39,209
Damn it!

821
00:47:40,547 --> 00:47:42,947
Yeah.! Okay.! Yeah.!

822
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:45,951
That's it.! Again.! Yeah.!

823
00:47:47,921 --> 00:47:49,445
All right!

824
00:47:55,329 --> 00:47:57,229
- Are you all right?
- Never better!

825
00:47:57,331 --> 00:48:00,232
I got some pep pills
from a trucker at the last stop!

826
00:48:00,334 --> 00:48:02,427
- Keeps me awake!
- You took pills?

827
00:48:02,536 --> 00:48:05,903
West coast turnarounds! Trucker said
to only take one, but I took all of them!

828
00:48:06,006 --> 00:48:07,997
- Maybe you should slow down.
- Why? We're making good time!

829
00:48:08,108 --> 00:48:10,009
- We're not even on the road!
- Huh?

830
00:48:10,111 --> 00:48:12,511
- I said, we're not even on the road!
- Don't need to be!

831
00:48:12,613 --> 00:48:14,410
Compass says west.
That's where we're headed.

832
00:48:14,515 --> 00:48:16,915
- Stewie, we're in the middle of the desert.
- I know!

833
00:48:17,018 --> 00:48:19,919
Imagine the nads on those guys
who did this on a wagon!

834
00:48:20,021 --> 00:48:22,285
Pioneers, Brian! We share their spirit!
Manifest Destiny!

835
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,052
- All right, that's it. Give me the wheel.
- Go to hell!

836
00:48:43,945 --> 00:48:46,846
This is horrible.

837
00:48:46,948 --> 00:48:50,612
- I'm so thirsty.
- Oh, my God, Brian. Do you see what I see?

838
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:52,880
A Dr. Pepper machine?

839
00:48:52,988 --> 00:48:54,819
Yes!
Oh, I can taste it now!

840
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:05,791
Damn it.
It was a mirage.

841
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,301
Oh, a RC Cola machine.

842
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,804
- Oh, that's it! I give up!
- What do you mean?

843
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:13,807
I never should have
attempted this in the first place.

844
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,309
- It was stupid!
- Hey, hey. Come on, now.

845
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:19,313
- You've come this far. Haven't you?
- It's no use!

846
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:22,816
Even if my real father is out there,
he probably doesn't want to see me.

847
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:26,820
You gotta see this through
to the end.

848
00:49:26,922 --> 00:49:29,322
Maybe this guy is your real father.
Maybe not.

849
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:32,657
But if you don't find out, you're gonna
spend the rest of your life wondering.

850
00:49:32,762 --> 00:49:34,662
Well, maybe you're right.

851
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:37,062
Come on. I'll stick by you
the whole way...

852
00:49:37,167 --> 00:49:39,567
...just like I did
when we were Siamese twins.

853
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:43,036
Hey, look at that woman, Brian.
She has no business in shorts.

854
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:45,505
Hey! You have
no business in shorts!

855
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:48,236
Ooh, tortillas!
Let's do soft tacos tonight.

856
00:49:51,247 --> 00:49:54,148
Well, we've taught you well, children.
It's in God's hands now.

857
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,684
Now go to the mall
and find yourself some dates.

858
00:49:56,786 --> 00:50:00,153
Find a girl who smokes.
Remember, if she smokes, she pokes.

859
00:50:00,256 --> 00:50:02,156
Bye, kids.

860
00:50:02,258 --> 00:50:04,692
- Do you think they're ready, Peter?
- I don't care.

861
00:50:04,794 --> 00:50:08,252
- All I care about is that we have our alone time.
- Me too.

862
00:50:08,364 --> 00:50:11,891
- Are we terrible people?
- Nah, nah. We're not terrible people, Lois.

863
00:50:12,001 --> 00:50:13,969
Horses
are terrible people.

864
00:50:16,073 --> 00:50:18,064
Murder! Murder!

865
00:50:25,015 --> 00:50:27,210
Well, we made it.
San Francisco.

866
00:50:27,318 --> 00:50:29,718
I bet this city's filled
with kooky roommates...

867
00:50:29,820 --> 00:50:31,981
...like the kind you see
all living together on TV.

868
00:50:34,592 --> 00:50:37,493
- Hey, Lion-O, what's going on?
- I'm not sure, Cheetara.

869
00:50:37,595 --> 00:50:40,496
But I've got a bad feeling
Mumm-Ra's up to something.

870
00:50:40,598 --> 00:50:43,761
Hmm. I'll be right back.
I'm gonna use the john.

871
00:50:43,868 --> 00:50:47,531
Eye of Thundera,
give me sight beyond sight.

872
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:53,232
Lion-O, what are you doing?
Snarf! Snarf!

873
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:56,245
Oh, hey, uh-
Not much, not much.

874
00:50:56,347 --> 00:50:59,283
You want to get wasted or something?

875
00:51:06,158 --> 00:51:08,888
Let's split up
and try to find him.

876
00:51:12,497 --> 00:51:15,898
Yeah, I just checked in. Yeah, I might
lose you. I just got in the elevator.

877
00:51:16,001 --> 00:51:18,231
Yeah, I'm gonna
grab a shower.

878
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:20,896
D- Did you guys eat yet?

879
00:51:21,006 --> 00:51:23,907
No- No, I'll-
No, I'll just take a cab.

880
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:25,909
You got your car?

881
00:51:26,011 --> 00:51:28,036
Do you wanna pick me up?

882
00:51:28,146 --> 00:51:31,047
Do you- Do you wanna-
Do you wanna pick me up?

883
00:51:31,149 --> 00:51:33,049
Do you wanna pick me up?

884
00:51:33,151 --> 00:51:35,915
Do you wanna pick me up?
Do you wanna pick me up?

885
00:51:43,563 --> 00:51:46,054
Father!

886
00:51:59,845 --> 00:52:02,678
Aah! Utedi.! Utedi.!

887
00:52:02,782 --> 00:52:04,750
Filthy creatures.

888
00:52:22,169 --> 00:52:24,069
Whoa-ohh!

889
00:52:24,171 --> 00:52:26,571
Damn! Why is there always
a fruit stand?

890
00:52:26,673 --> 00:52:28,573
High-speed pursuit in progress...

891
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:30,575
...headed south on Powell
toward Market Street.

892
00:52:30,677 --> 00:52:33,475
You heard him, people.
Powell and Market. Move it!

893
00:52:35,616 --> 00:52:38,517
I feel like I've searched
this whole bloody city.

894
00:52:38,619 --> 00:52:42,020
I suppose this means I'll never
find the answer to who I really am.

895
00:52:42,122 --> 00:52:44,022
Oh, well.
See you gents later.

896
00:52:44,124 --> 00:52:46,024
Free Tibet.
No grapes. All that.

897
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:49,357
Dude, I could have sworn that Nerf football
was just talkin' to me.

898
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:54,862
- Are you done with the arts section?
- Of course.

899
00:52:56,637 --> 00:52:59,197
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, dear.

900
00:52:59,306 --> 00:53:01,206
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
This is not good.

901
00:53:01,308 --> 00:53:03,208
This is very bad.
Very bad.

902
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:06,872
Oh, Daddy, I knew I'd find you!
I knew Peter couldn't be my real father!

903
00:53:06,981 --> 00:53:09,313
No, no, no. You've gotten it
all wrong, Stewie.

904
00:53:09,417 --> 00:53:11,385
Stewie?
How do you know my name?

905
00:53:11,486 --> 00:53:14,216
Because I'm not your father.
I'm you.

906
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:20,126
What the hell is this?

907
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:23,129
Looks like an intermission,
a chance to stretch the legs.

908
00:53:23,231 --> 00:53:25,631
Oh, man, I peed in this cup for nothin'?

909
00:53:25,733 --> 00:53:28,133
Dad, I just kicked over your Coke.

910
00:53:28,236 --> 00:53:31,637
I look atrocious.!
Did you see my ass? Oh, my God.!

911
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:35,004
This stinks.! I can't believe
they cut my whole sex scene.!

912
00:53:35,109 --> 00:53:37,009
It was so tastefully done.!

913
00:53:37,111 --> 00:53:40,012
Peter, could you go to the concession
stand? I want something to suck on.

914
00:53:40,114 --> 00:53:42,014
Giggedy-giggedy.!

915
00:53:42,116 --> 00:53:45,517
Hey, Quagmire, you think
we got time to go outside and burn one?

916
00:53:45,621 --> 00:53:48,021
It's not over yet? How long is this thing?

917
00:53:48,123 --> 00:53:52,025
Chris, do you have a shower scene?
Or do I have to keep dreamin'?

918
00:53:52,127 --> 00:53:54,027
Mmm.

919
00:53:54,129 --> 00:53:55,892
All right, we're back.

920
00:53:59,868 --> 00:54:01,699
You're me from the future?
That's absurd.

921
00:54:01,804 --> 00:54:03,704
I'm afraid it's true,
Stewie.

922
00:54:03,806 --> 00:54:06,206
I'm the man you dreamed you'd be
when you were alone in your bedroom...

923
00:54:06,308 --> 00:54:09,300
...planning world domination and singing
Donna Summer into your hairbrush.

924
00:54:09,411 --> 00:54:11,902
— Tell him
to just get out —

925
00:54:12,014 --> 00:54:14,574
— Nothin' left
to talk about —

926
00:54:14,683 --> 00:54:17,379
— Pack his raincoat
Show him out —

927
00:54:17,486 --> 00:54:21,252
—Just look him in the eyes
and simply shout —

928
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:23,348
— Enough is enough
Is enough —

929
00:54:23,459 --> 00:54:27,418
— I can't go on
I can't go on no more now —

930
00:54:27,529 --> 00:54:29,293
— Enough is enough
Is enough —

931
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:33,665
— I want him out
I want him out that door now ——

932
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,670
It is you- Uh, me!

933
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:39,299
Oh, God, I have to many questions about
the future. Is all food in pill form?

934
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:43,539
Do they have flying cars? Did they ever find
a successful vehicle for Ellen Cleghorne?

935
00:54:43,646 --> 00:54:46,547
I can't answer those questions. I'm not
even supposed to be talking to you.

936
00:54:46,649 --> 00:54:49,516
- It's a violation of the terms of my vacation.
- Vacation?

937
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:54,056
Yes. In the future, people take vacations
not to destinations, but to periods of time.

938
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:56,819
Just last summer I went back
to visitJesus Christ.

939
00:54:56,926 --> 00:54:59,827
Turns out his abilities
might have been exaggerated a bit.

940
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,878
I've already said enough.
I should be getting back.

941
00:55:23,988 --> 00:55:26,388
You can't just leave me.
I must know my future.

942
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:29,891
Sorry. It's against the rules.
Good-bye, Stewie.

943
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,053
Surprise!

944
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:35,064
Oh,
this is just great.

945
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:37,396
I can't believe it!
This is the future-

946
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,594
Wait a minute.
Everything looks the same.

947
00:55:39,703 --> 00:55:42,331
- Well, of course. It's only been 30 years.
- Where are the monuments to me?

948
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:44,340
Where are my legions
of followers?

949
00:55:44,442 --> 00:55:48,606
I thought I'd be absolute ruler of the world
by now, far away from that house full of idiots.

950
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:03,927
Sorry, Stewie. I abandoned my quest
for world domination long ago.

951
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:06,930
Well, am I at least
a city councilman or something?

952
00:56:07,032 --> 00:56:09,432
- Sorry.
- Oh, this is nothing like I imagined.

953
00:56:09,534 --> 00:56:11,434
I thought the future
would be different...

954
00:56:11,536 --> 00:56:14,596
...with jet packs, eco-domes and TV
they can beam right into your head.

955
00:56:14,706 --> 00:56:16,606
Uh, give me
Mork and Mindy.

956
00:56:17,876 --> 00:56:21,107
That's not how you sit in a chair!

957
00:56:22,714 --> 00:56:24,614
I'm late to Sunday dinner
with the family.

958
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:27,617
You'll have to wait in the car until
I can send you back.

959
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:30,119
Wait in the car?
I shall do no such thing.

960
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:32,918
- Hey, did they ever unfreeze Walt Disney?
- Ugh. Unfortunately.

961
00:56:33,024 --> 00:56:34,549
Welcome back,
Mr. Disney.

962
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:36,560
- Are theJews gone yet?
- Uh, no.

963
00:56:36,662 --> 00:56:38,527
Put me back in.

964
00:56:40,566 --> 00:56:43,467
Put some pants on.
The kids'll be here any minute.

965
00:56:43,569 --> 00:56:47,061
In a second, Lois. I'm watching
the Britney Spears comeback concert.

966
00:56:47,173 --> 00:56:48,663
Hi, everybody!

967
00:56:48,774 --> 00:56:51,368
I may have lost a foot
to diabetes...

968
00:56:51,477 --> 00:56:53,877
...but I'm still sexy,
y'all!

969
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:56,141
Now I'm gonna dance
for ya!

970
00:57:08,194 --> 00:57:11,357
- Oh, Stew. My big boy.
- Hello, Mother!

971
00:57:11,464 --> 00:57:14,900
She's still alive?
What the hell, man?

972
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:16,902
I brought a guest.

973
00:57:17,004 --> 00:57:20,770
This is, um, uh, Pablo, a child
from Nicaragua I've been sponsoring.

974
00:57:20,874 --> 00:57:22,842
My!
How wonderful!

975
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,467
Me gusta Nicaragua.

976
00:57:24,578 --> 00:57:27,012
Mmm, yes. Is that where
you got that leather handbag?

977
00:57:27,114 --> 00:57:30,447
Oh, I'm sorry. That's your face!
Ha ha! Oh! Got you!

978
00:57:30,551 --> 00:57:33,452
Thirty years later,
I still freaking got you!

979
00:57:33,554 --> 00:57:37,422
Oh, God! I feel
as invincible as Superman.

980
00:57:38,525 --> 00:57:40,425
Hey there, Wonder Woman.

981
00:57:40,527 --> 00:57:42,427
Flying your invisible plane,
I see.

982
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:44,793
Boy, this is awkward.

983
00:57:44,898 --> 00:57:48,425
I'm- I'm, uh, actually
in the lavatory of the invisible plane.

984
00:57:48,535 --> 00:57:51,766
- Oh. You mean, right now you're-
- Yeah.

985
00:57:57,511 --> 00:58:02,313
I couldn't help but notice you didn't
wash your hands in the invisible sink.

986
00:58:02,417 --> 00:58:04,317
Hi, everybody.
Sorry we're late.

987
00:58:04,419 --> 00:58:07,183
Stop fuckin' apologizing.
You sound like a fuckin' woman.

988
00:58:07,288 --> 00:58:09,882
I suppose
one of you has to.

989
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:13,188
- Oh, what a nice blouse, Vanessa.
- Chris's wife.

990
00:58:13,294 --> 00:58:16,024
Oh, thanks. I'm not sure my tiny brain
could've put that one together.

991
00:58:16,130 --> 00:58:19,657
Mom, I notice your hedges are pushing out
onto the curb, and that's a violation.

992
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:22,668
And your tags are expired,
and one of your taillights is busted.

993
00:58:22,770 --> 00:58:26,672
I'm not gonna run you in, but I will
if you don't give me a cookie.!

994
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:29,174
- Here you go, sweetie.
- Yea!

995
00:58:29,277 --> 00:58:32,041
Yeah, that's what that fat pig needs-
a fuckin' cookie.

996
00:58:32,146 --> 00:58:34,910
Hi, Vanessa.
Well, don't you look nice-

997
00:58:35,016 --> 00:58:37,917
Oh, no! I broke my hip!

998
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:40,180
- You need some help, Dad?
- No, I'm good.

999
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:42,917
Oh, are these the pictures
from your trip to Sonoma?

1000
00:58:43,025 --> 00:58:46,927
Oh, my God! Oh, look how beautiful
the countryside is.

1001
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:50,692
Oh, I'd love to get a house out there
if I had the money!

1002
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:55,532
That was a swell vacation. Much better than
that time I was stuck on that island with Bono.

1003
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,539
Bono,
stop screwin' around...

1004
00:58:58,641 --> 00:59:00,472
...and open up
that damn crate of food.

1005
00:59:00,576 --> 00:59:03,636
I'm saving this for the starvin' children
of the world in case we get rescued.

1006
00:59:03,746 --> 00:59:06,647
Yeah, you know what? That's us.
We're starvin'. Now open it up!

1007
00:59:06,749 --> 00:59:10,207
- I can't do that, Peter.
It's for the starvin' children.

1008
00:59:14,623 --> 00:59:16,523
Aha!

1009
00:59:16,625 --> 00:59:19,594
I'm just makin' sure
it tastes good for the starvin' children.

1010
00:59:22,631 --> 00:59:24,327
Knock knock.

1011
00:59:24,434 --> 00:59:27,335
- Oh, hi, Ron.
- Who is that fellow? He looks so familiar.

1012
00:59:27,437 --> 00:59:29,837
It's Meg. She had a sex change
right after college.

1013
00:59:29,939 --> 00:59:31,839
Wow!
She went to college?

1014
00:59:31,941 --> 00:59:34,842
I can't stay too late.
I gotta go shop for a razor.

1015
00:59:34,944 --> 00:59:37,742
You know, for my face,
where I grow my beard.

1016
00:59:37,847 --> 00:59:39,712
We get it.
You're a guy.

1017
00:59:41,818 --> 00:59:45,219
- What is this one, my prom?
- Oh, yes. That's Shirley Blitt.

1018
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:49,087
We couldn't do any dancing because of her
club foot, but the punch was delicious.

1019
00:59:49,192 --> 00:59:51,456
I think somebody
put mango in it.

1020
00:59:51,561 --> 00:59:54,462
Isn't it funny that I remember that
after all these years?

1021
00:59:56,166 --> 00:59:59,397
Well, there he is.

1022
00:59:59,502 --> 01:00:01,402
Oh, this is fantastic!

1023
01:00:01,504 --> 01:00:03,665
That's not really
appropriate, Stewie.

1024
01:00:03,773 --> 01:00:06,675
Oh, of course it is. I loathed that
know-it-all, flea-bitten mutt.

1025
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:10,440
No, it's just that the meaning of that word
has changed ever since President Douchebag.

1026
01:00:10,548 --> 01:00:12,243
Thank you!

1027
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:15,910
I just received a call from
my worthy opponent, Senator Daterape.

1028
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:19,421
No, no. He ran a good campaign...

1029
01:00:19,523 --> 01:00:21,923
...but the people of America
have spoken...

1030
01:00:22,026 --> 01:00:25,985
...and they're saying they want
four more years of Douchebag!

1031
01:00:26,097 --> 01:00:29,589
Douchebag! Douchebag!
Douchebag! Douchebag!

1032
01:00:32,703 --> 01:00:35,137
That is some
fuckin' good dinner, Mrs. Griffin.

1033
01:00:35,239 --> 01:00:37,400
Thank you.

1034
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:40,409
Excuse me. I'm gonna go help Peter
with the dishes.

1035
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,411
Ron, Stu,
I need your help.

1036
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:45,914
I need you two to tell those parents of yours
they're moving into a retirement home...

1037
01:00:46,016 --> 01:00:48,918
'cause Mr. Empty Sac
over here won't do it.

1038
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:52,387
Stu, you don't want Mom and Dad
to go to a retirement home, do you?

1039
01:00:52,491 --> 01:00:54,789
Well, u-uh, it's, uh-

1040
01:00:54,893 --> 01:00:57,794
I- Stu, could you
help me with the dishes?

1041
01:00:57,896 --> 01:00:59,796
Be right there, Mother!

1042
01:00:59,898 --> 01:01:03,129
Actually, Vanessa- Stu, I need your help!
There are dishes everywhere!

1043
01:01:03,235 --> 01:01:05,135
Oh, sorry. Must go.

1044
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:07,899
Well, I can't do it to 'em.
They're my parents.

1045
01:01:08,006 --> 01:01:10,566
Don't you ever want to inherit
this house, you fat fuck?

1046
01:01:10,675 --> 01:01:14,111
Or am I the only one who has any desire to
move out from under the fucking power lines?

1047
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,112
What's that?
Oh, it's cancer!

1048
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:19,274
Can we please not do this
in front of Pablo?

1049
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,716
Ah, screw him!
That fuckin' kid's from Guam.

1050
01:01:21,820 --> 01:01:23,720
Probably only speaks Spanish
or some shit.

1051
01:01:23,822 --> 01:01:26,950
Let me tell you something, 'Nessa-
a bullet sounds the same in every language.

1052
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,527
So stick a fucking sock in it,
you cow!

1053
01:01:31,898 --> 01:01:35,800
You can crash at my place tonight, but
tomorrow we're going to get you back home.

1054
01:01:35,902 --> 01:01:38,336
Well,
welcome to Chez Stu.

1055
01:01:39,372 --> 01:01:41,237
Dear God,
this is where I live?

1056
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:44,776
- All alone in a filthy hovel?
- Well, I wouldn't exactly say "alone. "

1057
01:01:44,877 --> 01:01:47,107
Let me introduce
my roommate.

1058
01:01:47,213 --> 01:01:49,113
He's sometimes
late on the rent...

1059
01:01:49,215 --> 01:01:52,343
...and never shy about sharing the gas bill,
if you know what I mean.

1060
01:01:52,451 --> 01:01:54,817
Did you just make
a fart joke?

1061
01:01:54,921 --> 01:01:56,821
Hey, Stu,
got big plans for tonight?

1062
01:01:56,923 --> 01:01:59,790
Sure do, Rupert. I'm finally going
to organize my photo albums.

1063
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:01,723
Yeah, right!

1064
01:02:01,828 --> 01:02:04,956
I say, what happened to his leg?
Oh, wait, now I remember.

1065
01:02:05,064 --> 01:02:08,625
You are gonna sit there and tell me
a flat tax doesn't favor the wealthy?

1066
01:02:08,734 --> 01:02:11,134
Not one bit, and it saves
millions of man-hours...

1067
01:02:11,237 --> 01:02:13,638
...that the complexity of
the current tax code wastes...

1068
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:16,140
...which you would realize
if you weren't retarded.

1069
01:02:16,243 --> 01:02:18,302
Hey, give him back. Stop that.
What are you doing?

1070
01:02:18,412 --> 01:02:20,937
- Give me back his leg.
- Oh, you'll get it back.

1071
01:02:23,884 --> 01:02:27,513
This is my bulletin board
where I put all my favorite comic strips.

1072
01:02:27,621 --> 01:02:29,521
See, look.
Here's the Lockhorns.

1073
01:02:29,623 --> 01:02:33,354
Mrs. Lockhorn is saying,
"We're never going to another yard sale,"

1074
01:02:33,460 --> 01:02:36,361
...because Mr. Lockhorn
has clearly purchased a tuba!

1075
01:02:36,463 --> 01:02:38,863
And from the look on her face...

1076
01:02:38,966 --> 01:02:41,867
I'd say he's not playing it
very well at all.

1077
01:02:41,969 --> 01:02:43,903
You get it?

1078
01:02:44,004 --> 01:02:46,404
You got these
from Parade magazine?

1079
01:02:46,506 --> 01:02:49,964
You read Parade magazine?
Ohhh!

1080
01:02:50,077 --> 01:02:54,879
Hey, Stu! It's Monday,
which can only mean one thing!

1081
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:58,009
Go-Gurt Day!

1082
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:00,019
Oh, Fran, this is Pablo
from Nicaragua.

1083
01:03:00,121 --> 01:03:03,579
Pablo, this is Fran.
She is hilarious.!

1084
01:03:03,691 --> 01:03:07,024
Hey, Pablo.
Just kiddin'!

1085
01:03:07,128 --> 01:03:09,494
I told you! She's so twisted!

1086
01:03:09,597 --> 01:03:11,997
Well, I'd better get
back to my department...

1087
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:14,591
...before Genghis the day manager
makes his rounds.

1088
01:03:14,702 --> 01:03:18,194
Genghis the day mana- Is that from
something, or did you just make that up?

1089
01:03:18,306 --> 01:03:20,206
- I just made it up!
- Oh-ho-ho!

1090
01:03:20,308 --> 01:03:22,572
Oh!
All day long.

1091
01:03:22,677 --> 01:03:25,237
- Well, I guess it's not all bad.
- What do you mean?

1092
01:03:25,346 --> 01:03:28,247
Don't be coy, you dirty horndog.
You're humping Fran.

1093
01:03:28,349 --> 01:03:31,750
Tell me, how many times have we gotten into
those Lane Bryant stretch pants?

1094
01:03:31,853 --> 01:03:34,754
- What? Never. - Damn right,
never- What do you mean, never?

1095
01:03:34,856 --> 01:03:37,758
Stewie, I've never
slept with any woman.

1096
01:03:37,860 --> 01:03:39,828
I've never had sex.

1097
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:42,930
All right, that's it!

1098
01:03:43,032 --> 01:03:45,933
I could handle the crappy apartment
and the pedestrian job.

1099
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:49,436
But now you're telling me I'm a 35-year-old,
Parade magazine-reading virgin?

1100
01:03:49,538 --> 01:03:51,438
Well, you, sir,
are pathetic!

1101
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:54,941
So forget about sending me back, because I'm
not leaving until we do a complete overhaul...

1102
01:03:55,044 --> 01:03:57,444
...on this sad thing
you call a life.

1103
01:03:57,546 --> 01:03:59,844
- Can I still read Parade?
- No, you cannot still read Parade!

1104
01:04:03,152 --> 01:04:06,053
We've got a big day of
overhauling your life ahead.

1105
01:04:06,155 --> 01:04:08,555
First we've got to
fix up this apartment- Stop that.

1106
01:04:08,657 --> 01:04:10,557
- What?
- Why are you staring at my genitals?

1107
01:04:10,659 --> 01:04:13,389
I'm not allowed to tell you anything about
your own future, but I will say this-

1108
01:04:13,495 --> 01:04:15,395
Enjoy your left testicle
while you can.

1109
01:04:15,497 --> 01:04:17,397
- What?
- I've said too much.

1110
01:04:19,336 --> 01:04:20,963
So, what do you think?

1111
01:04:21,071 --> 01:04:24,404
I've got to hand it to you.
It really is an improvement.

1112
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:26,907
And you haven't even seen
the best part.

1113
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:29,501
Stress-release candles for those
extra-tough days at the office.

1114
01:04:29,612 --> 01:04:33,048
You don't know the half of it.
On Tuesdays I work Returns.

1115
01:04:33,149 --> 01:04:36,744
I bought this boom box here,
and it's got this high-pitched whine.

1116
01:04:36,853 --> 01:04:38,912
Well, let's have a look.

1117
01:04:39,022 --> 01:04:41,616
Ha-ha! It's yours now, sucker!

1118
01:04:41,725 --> 01:04:45,388
All right, now that you've got a swinging pad,
it's time to bring Fran back here...

1119
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:47,725
...and, um, you know.

1120
01:04:48,798 --> 01:04:50,698
- What?
- Well, I have no idea.

1121
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,200
- I thought you knew.
- No, I have no idea.

1122
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:56,204
You're the adult here. I was counting on you
to know the mechanics, because-

1123
01:04:56,306 --> 01:04:59,742
Well, let's face it, as a baby all I've got
to go on is beer commercial innuendo...

1124
01:04:59,843 --> 01:05:01,812
...and that myth
about where babies come from.

1125
01:05:03,814 --> 01:05:06,078
Oh, my God!
The stork!

1126
01:05:10,488 --> 01:05:12,388
Where's my baby?

1127
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:15,391
Sweetie, you and me
are gonna make the baby.

1128
01:05:20,331 --> 01:05:22,231
Which Law and Order
is this?

1129
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:25,894
This is Law and Order:
P.C.A.M.P.I.E.O.F. T.D. -

1130
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:29,564
Petty Crimes Against Municipal Property
In Excess of Five Thousand Dollars.

1131
01:05:29,673 --> 01:05:31,573
Oh, that kid's
spraying graffiti.

1132
01:05:31,675 --> 01:05:34,235
That is not gonna be cheap
to have that wall repainted.

1133
01:05:34,345 --> 01:05:36,245
Kids,
what are you doing here?

1134
01:05:36,347 --> 01:05:39,908
Mom, Dad, Vanessa wants us
to put you guys in a retirement home.

1135
01:05:40,017 --> 01:05:41,917
But I think
it's ridiculous.

1136
01:05:42,019 --> 01:05:43,920
A retirement home?

1137
01:05:44,022 --> 01:05:46,456
Now, Vanessa says
it's not that bad, Mom.

1138
01:05:46,558 --> 01:05:49,288
She says they have people there
who will wipe your bottom.

1139
01:05:49,394 --> 01:05:51,726
You gotta be yankin' me.
That is sweet!

1140
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,730
That doesn't sound
ridiculous at all, Meg.

1141
01:05:53,832 --> 01:05:55,993
My name is Ron.

1142
01:05:56,101 --> 01:06:00,299
Oh, I wish Brian were here.
He'd never let you put us in a home.

1143
01:06:00,405 --> 01:06:03,306
Oh, but at least
he's in a better place now.

1144
01:06:03,408 --> 01:06:05,308
Wow, look at me.

1145
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:08,811
Hanging out drinking with Ernest Hemingway,
Van Gogh and Kurt Cobain.

1146
01:06:08,914 --> 01:06:12,315
Still, it feels like we all got here
a little earlier than we should have.

1147
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:16,547
Well, I finally collapsed under the weight
of my own genius and shot myself.

1148
01:06:16,655 --> 01:06:18,555
I could not reconcile
my passion...

1149
01:06:18,657 --> 01:06:22,058
...with the way people around me
were living, so I shot myself.

1150
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:25,062
I hated the thought of my music becoming
part of some bland corporate mechanism...

1151
01:06:25,164 --> 01:06:27,064
...so I shot myself.

1152
01:06:27,166 --> 01:06:30,795
Yeah, I, uh, I got into the garbage
and ate some chocolate.

1153
01:06:34,507 --> 01:06:36,407
My word!

1154
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:39,910
Yes, evidently the razor wasn't invented
till sometime in the late '80s.

1155
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:41,912
Okay, then let's begin.

1156
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:44,414
And here we go. And watch my hand.
And one, two, three.

1157
01:06:44,517 --> 01:06:47,509
Put it in, take it out.
Put it in, take it out.

1158
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:49,281
— I am the monarch
of the sea —

1159
01:06:49,388 --> 01:06:51,151
— The ruler of
the queen's navy —

1160
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:52,918
— Whose praise
Great Britain loudly chants —

1161
01:06:53,025 --> 01:06:54,788
— And we are his sisters
and his cousins and his aunts ——

1162
01:06:54,894 --> 01:06:59,160
Good, you've got the rhythm. Now try it
with Swiss cheese. Take it from the top.

1163
01:07:08,208 --> 01:07:10,108
I really enjoyed
the movie tonight.

1164
01:07:10,210 --> 01:07:13,111
- And I'm not tired at all.
- Oh, yeah? Good, good.

1165
01:07:13,213 --> 01:07:15,181
I enjoyed
the movie too.

1166
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:20,344
Oh, hey, I hear they're extending
our store hours until 9:30.

1167
01:07:20,454 --> 01:07:22,354
Oh, that's, um-

1168
01:07:22,456 --> 01:07:24,356
...that's great.

1169
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:26,016
- Let's have sex! -
What? - Definitely!

1170
01:07:26,126 --> 01:07:27,718
I'll be right back.

1171
01:07:27,828 --> 01:07:31,229
- What is wrong with you? I can't go through with this.
- Why the hell not?

1172
01:07:31,331 --> 01:07:33,231
L- I-I'm too nervous.

1173
01:07:33,333 --> 01:07:35,233
I'm putting in my diaphragm.!

1174
01:07:35,335 --> 01:07:38,236
- See? I don't even know what that is.
- Get in there!

1175
01:07:38,338 --> 01:07:40,238
- No! No!
- You listen to me.

1176
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:42,240
You listen to me,
Stewart Griffin.

1177
01:07:42,342 --> 01:07:44,242
You march in there
right now and...

1178
01:07:44,344 --> 01:07:46,505
"insert your phallus
into her vagina. "

1179
01:07:46,613 --> 01:07:48,581
Go!

1180
01:07:51,719 --> 01:07:54,119
L- I'm sorry.
That's, um-

1181
01:07:54,222 --> 01:07:56,122
That's never happened
to me before.

1182
01:07:56,224 --> 01:08:00,126
Which part? The eight seconds of sex,
or the 40 minutes of crying?

1183
01:08:00,228 --> 01:08:02,128
Uh, I guess both.

1184
01:08:03,398 --> 01:08:06,299
Do I- Do I give you money
or something?

1185
01:08:06,401 --> 01:08:08,369
Yeah, I'm gonna go.

1186
01:08:11,472 --> 01:08:14,373
Eight seconds! That's twice as good
as you did in rehearsal.

1187
01:08:14,475 --> 01:08:18,377
Stu, I heard from Juan in Car Stereo
Installation about what you did to Fran.

1188
01:08:18,479 --> 01:08:20,379
Interoffice sex
is prohibited...

1189
01:08:20,481 --> 01:08:23,541
...regardless of how hilariously brief
and unsatisfying it was.

1190
01:08:23,651 --> 01:08:25,551
You're fired.

1191
01:08:25,653 --> 01:08:28,554
- Fired? Oh, this is not good.
- Oh, dear.

1192
01:08:28,656 --> 01:08:33,458
This is almost as bad as when Peter got fired
as the first director of Terms of Endearment.

1193
01:08:33,562 --> 01:08:35,962
Kids, I don't
have much time left...

1194
01:08:36,065 --> 01:08:38,966
...and I can't talk for too long
'cause I get real upset.

1195
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:41,468
I want you to make
a lot of friends...

1196
01:08:41,570 --> 01:08:45,472
...and be real nice to the girls- They're gonna
be real important to you after I'm gone.

1197
01:08:45,574 --> 01:08:47,542
Sweet.

1198
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:54,081
Oh, cheer up. You didn't need
that crappy job anyway.

1199
01:08:54,183 --> 01:08:57,243
You are not allowed to speak.
You have ruined everything!

1200
01:08:57,353 --> 01:09:01,255
Nice. I donate my time trying to fix your
pathetic life, and this is the thanks I get?

1201
01:09:01,357 --> 01:09:04,258
Well, it's not the first gift
that's ever gone unappreciated.

1202
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:06,260
Merry Christmas,
sweetheart.

1203
01:09:06,362 --> 01:09:08,762
Oh, Peter,
thank you!

1204
01:09:08,864 --> 01:09:12,197
An arcade-style Galaga machine.

1205
01:09:12,301 --> 01:09:14,202
Oh, thank you,
Peter-

1206
01:09:14,304 --> 01:09:16,898
Move!

1207
01:09:17,007 --> 01:09:20,408
Look, all right, I'll admit that maybe
things haven't gone exactly to plan.

1208
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:23,411
We'll go home and regroup
and hit 'em hard tomorrow.

1209
01:09:23,513 --> 01:09:25,674
Good lord!
My apartment!

1210
01:09:27,784 --> 01:09:30,981
Looks like the cause of the fire
were these stress-release candles.

1211
01:09:31,087 --> 01:09:33,647
Huh!
— Irony —

1212
01:09:39,963 --> 01:09:42,864
I don't know, Peter.
This place is pretty depressing.

1213
01:09:42,966 --> 01:09:45,867
What are you talking about?
It's just like old times. Hey, Cleveland.

1214
01:09:45,969 --> 01:09:49,564
Hello...

1215
01:09:49,673 --> 01:09:52,039
Peter.

1216
01:09:52,142 --> 01:09:54,042
Hey, Joe, how are things
since the operation?

1217
01:09:54,144 --> 01:09:56,545
Oh, great, Peter.

1218
01:09:56,647 --> 01:09:59,810
Who would have guessed I'd be one
of the few not in a wheelchair?

1219
01:09:59,917 --> 01:10:01,817
I sure do miss Bonnie
though.

1220
01:10:01,919 --> 01:10:04,149
It's amazing they were able
to give you her legs.

1221
01:10:04,255 --> 01:10:08,089
— Who wears short shorts —
I wear short shorts!

1222
01:10:08,192 --> 01:10:10,456
Hey, Glenn.
How's the arthritis?

1223
01:10:10,561 --> 01:10:13,462
Ah, not bad. Course, since you walked in
I'm feelin' a little stiff!

1224
01:10:13,564 --> 01:10:16,465
Giggedy-gigg- Oh!
I just pooped a little.

1225
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:20,401
Oh, that's nasty.

1226
01:10:22,273 --> 01:10:25,674
Um, hey, you know what I do
when I'm feeling down?

1227
01:10:25,776 --> 01:10:27,676
I play the glad game.

1228
01:10:27,778 --> 01:10:31,179
I think about all the things
that make me glad. Let's try it, shall we?

1229
01:10:31,282 --> 01:10:34,183
Um... Pinwheels.

1230
01:10:34,285 --> 01:10:37,311
A big wedge of cake
from the fair.

1231
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:41,425
A doodad
to wear in your hat.

1232
01:10:42,561 --> 01:10:44,961
All right, I'm sorry.
It's all my fault.

1233
01:10:45,063 --> 01:10:46,963
No, it's my fault.

1234
01:10:47,065 --> 01:10:49,590
My whole life's been a mess
ever since that near-death experience.

1235
01:10:49,701 --> 01:10:52,101
- I mean, nothing goes right-
- Wait, wait, wait.

1236
01:10:52,204 --> 01:10:55,105
Near-death experience?
At the community pool?

1237
01:10:55,207 --> 01:10:58,108
- But that was nothing.
- Well, that's what I thought at first.

1238
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:01,509
But around the time of my 20th birthday
I started having nightmares.

1239
01:11:01,613 --> 01:11:04,514
Then my therapist said I've been suppressing
some very complex emotions...

1240
01:11:04,616 --> 01:11:06,811
...that may well have caused me
to take fewer risks.

1241
01:11:06,918 --> 01:11:09,580
Well, then, it seems
there's only one thing to do.

1242
01:11:09,688 --> 01:11:11,588
I must return to the past...

1243
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:14,591
...to ensure I never have the close call with
that lifeguard tower in the first place.

1244
01:11:14,693 --> 01:11:17,594
Oh, I just thought of another one
for the glad game.

1245
01:11:17,696 --> 01:11:21,360
The first scissor cut into a fresh piece
of construction paper.

1246
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:23,435
Oh, yeah!

1247
01:11:25,538 --> 01:11:27,199
Here's what we do.

1248
01:11:27,306 --> 01:11:30,207
You buy me one of those
time-travel watches...

1249
01:11:30,309 --> 01:11:33,210
...and I'll go back to my own time and stop
that near-death experience.

1250
01:11:33,312 --> 01:11:36,907
- I can't afford one. I don't have a job, thanks to you.
- How hard is it to get a new job?

1251
01:11:37,016 --> 01:11:38,984
Even I had that job
at the airport.

1252
01:11:40,086 --> 01:11:41,986
Jonny Quest.

1253
01:11:42,088 --> 01:11:43,988
Okay.
Welcome aboard.

1254
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:45,990
Dr. Benton Quest.

1255
01:11:46,092 --> 01:11:48,492
All right.
Have a good flight.

1256
01:11:48,594 --> 01:11:50,494
Hadji. Hmm.

1257
01:11:50,596 --> 01:11:53,531
Um, listen, you've been randomly
selected for additional screening.

1258
01:11:53,633 --> 01:11:55,624
But you didn't even
type anything in.

1259
01:11:55,735 --> 01:11:57,965
If it were up to me,
you'd be on that flight.

1260
01:11:58,070 --> 01:12:02,508
But, uh, I'm gonna need you to take off
your shoes and that lovely, uh, hat.

1261
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:05,806
- Sim-sim-salabim.!
- Yeah, I'd cut back on that.

1262
01:12:05,913 --> 01:12:08,245
We'll have to borrow the money
from Mommy and Daddy.

1263
01:12:08,348 --> 01:12:10,248
- Aaah!
- Never call them that again!

1264
01:12:10,350 --> 01:12:13,581
- It's Lois and the fat man! Do you hear me?
- Yes! Yes!

1265
01:12:13,687 --> 01:12:16,588
Smells like Head & Shoulders.
But you don't have dandruff.

1266
01:12:16,690 --> 01:12:19,523
- Exactly!
- Ah!

1267
01:12:22,095 --> 01:12:25,394
- And now here's Diane with a look at traffic.
- Thanks, Tom.

1268
01:12:25,499 --> 01:12:28,400
There was a major pile-up
in the ambulatory wing this morning...

1269
01:12:28,502 --> 01:12:30,902
...when one of the residents
vomited in the hallway.

1270
01:12:31,004 --> 01:12:34,496
And in international news, I'm fairly certain
that Filipino nurse is stealing from me.

1271
01:12:35,542 --> 01:12:37,442
Oh, hey, you two.

1272
01:12:37,544 --> 01:12:40,445
- What brings you here?
- Lois, Pablo here needs your help.

1273
01:12:40,547 --> 01:12:42,447
Can we drop
the whole Pablo thing?

1274
01:12:42,549 --> 01:12:47,112
- Do you think I don't remember my own little Stewie?
- You clever, clever shrew!

1275
01:12:47,222 --> 01:12:49,690
Stu, you could get
in a lot of trouble for this.

1276
01:12:49,791 --> 01:12:51,691
Take him back
to his own time.

1277
01:12:51,793 --> 01:12:54,626
Well, that's why we're here.
I need a loan.

1278
01:12:54,729 --> 01:12:57,630
Done. This is a secret account
Peter can't access.

1279
01:12:57,732 --> 01:13:00,132
I never could
trust him with money.

1280
01:13:00,235 --> 01:13:03,227
Like the time he spent Meg's college money
on that medieval catapult.

1281
01:13:03,338 --> 01:13:05,932
Hey!

1282
01:13:06,040 --> 01:13:10,875
Excellent. These dominoes are set up exactly
as I want them, right next to the good china.

1283
01:13:10,979 --> 01:13:13,880
Now I'll just place this priceless
Fabergé egg in the center...

1284
01:13:13,982 --> 01:13:16,382
...right next to my newborn
hemophiliac baby.

1285
01:13:18,152 --> 01:13:20,052
- Hey, those yours?
- Yes.

1286
01:13:20,154 --> 01:13:22,054
Oh. Those are all
really nice things.

1287
01:13:22,156 --> 01:13:25,751
Thank you. You hear that, Evan?
We were complimented.

1288
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:28,762
Take as much money as you need,
but there's a couple of conditions.

1289
01:13:28,864 --> 01:13:33,267
On your way back to the past, make sure
Chris never marries that bitch Vanessa.

1290
01:13:33,369 --> 01:13:37,772
And I want a promise that I won't
spend my old age in a place like this.

1291
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:42,276
Oh, believe me, Lois, I promise you will
never end up in a retirement home.

1292
01:13:59,528 --> 01:14:01,428
All right,
let's do this.

1293
01:14:06,135 --> 01:14:08,228
Well, I suppose
this is it.

1294
01:14:08,338 --> 01:14:12,741
I just hit me that if you are successful
in preventing our near-death experience...

1295
01:14:12,842 --> 01:14:15,402
...it'll turn me into
an entirely different Stu.

1296
01:14:15,512 --> 01:14:17,412
Then you know
what you should do?

1297
01:14:17,514 --> 01:14:20,915
Since the time line is going to
change anyway, you should get really fat.

1298
01:14:21,017 --> 01:14:26,478
Go buy a whole pint of ice cream and shovel down
the whole thing. I mean, just really pig out.

1299
01:14:26,590 --> 01:14:28,490
Ooh, that's brilliant!

1300
01:14:28,592 --> 01:14:32,153
Hey, and if the city thinks I'm paying
this parking ticket, they are dreaming!

1301
01:14:35,632 --> 01:14:38,601
No, I'm not really gonna do it,
you know, just in case.

1302
01:14:39,769 --> 01:14:42,567
- Good-bye, Stewie.
- So long, Stu.

1303
01:14:46,409 --> 01:14:49,810
And if anyone has any objection
to this union of Chris and Vanessa...

1304
01:14:49,913 --> 01:14:52,883
...let them speak now
or forever hold their peace.

1305
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:55,846
Uh, I do.

1306
01:14:59,290 --> 01:15:02,726
So, don't let this keep you
from enjoying the reception...

1307
01:15:02,827 --> 01:15:05,227
...where I'm sure they'll be
playing the Chicken Dance.

1308
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:08,059
So enjoy the Chicken Dance.

1309
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,799
Damn! I overshot it!

1310
01:15:12,903 --> 01:15:15,997
1974.
University of Denver.

1311
01:15:16,107 --> 01:15:18,667
I say, Condoleezza Rice
goes here.

1312
01:15:18,776 --> 01:15:24,305
Damn! I ain't never gonna let
the Man get me down, crazy crackers!

1313
01:15:24,415 --> 01:15:27,077
Black Panthers
stand tall!

1314
01:15:28,285 --> 01:15:30,185
Mmm!

1315
01:15:35,327 --> 01:15:37,227
Blast!
This isn't the pool either!

1316
01:15:37,329 --> 01:15:39,923
But at least I've arrived
on the correct date.

1317
01:15:41,099 --> 01:15:44,330
Only 30 minutes
before the tower falls!

1318
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:50,367
Damn! I've got to
get to that swim meet!

1319
01:15:56,415 --> 01:15:58,383
Huh?

1320
01:16:02,120 --> 01:16:05,521
Hi. Stewie Griffin. Stewie Griffin.
Hi. How are you?

1321
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:10,060
Huh?

1322
01:16:10,162 --> 01:16:12,323
Smells good. Dinner's ready.

1323
01:16:45,064 --> 01:16:48,591
Probably shouldn't have milked that landing.

1324
01:17:01,048 --> 01:17:02,948
Don't...
press that.

1325
01:17:03,050 --> 01:17:06,577
Future...
35-year-old virgin...

1326
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:09,451
Fran! Fran!

1327
01:17:09,556 --> 01:17:11,524
- Fran!
- What the devil?

1328
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:15,260
Yes! I did it! I stopped the tower
from falling!

1329
01:17:15,362 --> 01:17:17,262
- Who are you?
- I'm you, from the future.

1330
01:17:17,364 --> 01:17:19,264
From the future?
My word!

1331
01:17:19,366 --> 01:17:22,267
Did they ever find a successful vehicle
for Ellen Cleghorne?

1332
01:17:22,369 --> 01:17:25,770
Oh, that's so funny. I asked that very
same question and never got an answer.

1333
01:17:25,873 --> 01:17:27,932
Well, then you're as disposable
as she is!

1334
01:17:28,041 --> 01:17:29,941
Oh, come on,
my little champion.

1335
01:17:30,043 --> 01:17:32,910
Oh, my God! At least have the decency
to carry me, you lazy skank!

1336
01:17:33,013 --> 01:17:34,913
Of course,
it is comfortable-

1337
01:17:37,017 --> 01:17:41,387
Hey, thanks again for explaining football
to me, Mr. - Sorry. I didn't catch your name.

1338
01:17:41,489 --> 01:17:44,390
- You can call me Ron.
- Ron, huh?

1339
01:17:44,492 --> 01:17:48,656
You know, I've always really liked
that name- Ron.

1340
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:08,548
Oh. Oh.
Oh, come on.

1341
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,550
Come on. Come on!

1342
01:18:10,652 --> 01:18:12,882
Come on!
Oh! Oh! That's it!

1343
01:18:12,987 --> 01:18:16,423
That's it. That's it.
Yes. Yes! Yes!

1344
01:18:16,524 --> 01:18:18,424
Eat my dust,
Crash Bandicoot!

1345
01:18:18,526 --> 01:18:20,926
- Tom, you're on in two.
- Good evening.

1346
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:23,760
For you people just joining us
after fast-forwarding through the "movie"...

1347
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:25,766
...to get to
the extra material...

1348
01:18:25,868 --> 01:18:27,859
...we're covering
the Family Guy wrap party.

1349
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,870
We're going live
to the Drunken Clam...

1350
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:33,271
...where Asian reporter
Tricia Takanawa is having a few drinks...

1351
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,343
...and reportedly
loved the movie long time.

1352
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:38,345
- Tricia?
- Thank you, Diane.

1353
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:43,077
I think "mildly entertained" would
be the best way to describe the reaction...

1354
01:18:43,185 --> 01:18:45,085
...here at the after-party.

1355
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:49,590
Horace the bartender has really
outdone himself with the decorations.

1356
01:18:49,692 --> 01:18:53,594
There are balloons
and streamers.

1357
01:18:53,696 --> 01:18:57,564
Now let's get some reactions
from these huge Family Guy fans.

1358
01:18:57,666 --> 01:18:59,566
How'd you
like the movie, sir?

1359
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,863
It sucked. Big whoop.
Wanna fight about it?

1360
01:19:01,971 --> 01:19:05,203
Who do I see about getting
the last two hours of my life back?

1361
01:19:05,308 --> 01:19:08,209
If I wanted to hear
81 minutes of gay bashin'...

1362
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:10,541
I would've gone
to my father's house.

1363
01:19:10,647 --> 01:19:14,606
Terrific. And here comes
the family of the hour.

1364
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:20,822
Will there be a sequel?
Is it true you're running for mayor?

1365
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:23,722
Do you think Capone and his cronies will
rule the streets of Chicago forever?

1366
01:19:24,828 --> 01:19:27,160
I'm standing here
with Peter Griffin.

1367
01:19:27,264 --> 01:19:29,698
Peter, congratulations
on your big night.

1368
01:19:29,799 --> 01:19:31,699
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1369
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:33,996
Hey, how's
Mr. Eddie's father doin'?

1370
01:19:34,104 --> 01:19:36,004
That's fresh.

1371
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:38,472
Peter, how do you respond
to the accusations...

1372
01:19:38,575 --> 01:19:41,476
...that you were responsible
for the series' cancellation?

1373
01:19:41,578 --> 01:19:43,478
Well, the show
had been on for a while.

1374
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:47,483
I was talking to Alan Alda, and he said
the same thing that Doc Cosby told me-

1375
01:19:47,585 --> 01:19:51,385
...that it was my face out there,
and I should take creative control.

1376
01:19:51,489 --> 01:19:55,949
So I did. We pushed the envelope,
creatively, and I stand by my work.

1377
01:19:58,062 --> 01:20:00,963
Peter, can we cut?
This isn't workin' for me.

1378
01:20:01,065 --> 01:20:03,966
Who yells cut, Cleveland?
The only one who yells cut is the director.

1379
01:20:04,068 --> 01:20:06,969
Look, if you want me
to fuck this chick, I'll fuck her.

1380
01:20:07,071 --> 01:20:09,972
But don't make me
go through all this bullshit.

1381
01:20:10,074 --> 01:20:12,702
You're showin' a real ugly side,
Griffin.

1382
01:20:12,810 --> 01:20:14,710
Did I miss my cue?

1383
01:20:14,812 --> 01:20:18,213
Although I probably pushed things
too far when I did the incest episode.

1384
01:20:20,318 --> 01:20:22,445
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Chris.

1385
01:20:24,088 --> 01:20:26,386
Wrong! It's wrong!

1386
01:20:26,490 --> 01:20:29,892
Still, that said, I'm not the one who
put us up against Friends and Survivor.

1387
01:20:29,995 --> 01:20:31,895
What have you
been doing since?

1388
01:20:31,997 --> 01:20:34,261
I had a couple of part-time jobs
that didn't work out.

1389
01:20:35,767 --> 01:20:39,328
I thought you could go in the suit,
like the astronauts.

1390
01:20:40,605 --> 01:20:42,505
I thought you could
go in the suit...

1391
01:20:42,607 --> 01:20:44,131
...like the astronauts.

1392
01:20:45,577 --> 01:20:47,477
- Hey, I gotta take a leak.
- Peter!

1393
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:49,638
If you open that suit,
you'll die.

1394
01:20:49,748 --> 01:20:52,717
Right, right.
What are you trying to do, get me fired?

1395
01:20:58,457 --> 01:21:01,290
And your wife Lois
is looking very lovely.

1396
01:21:01,393 --> 01:21:03,258
How does it feel
to be back?

1397
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:07,765
It feels good. It was a
very dark period for me for a while.

1398
01:21:07,866 --> 01:21:09,766
- License and registration.
- Fuck you!

1399
01:21:09,868 --> 01:21:11,769
Do you know
who I am?

1400
01:21:11,871 --> 01:21:13,771
I'm afraid I don't, ma'am.

1401
01:21:13,873 --> 01:21:15,773
Please give me
your license and registration.

1402
01:21:15,875 --> 01:21:18,776
- Ma'am, what are you doing?
- I'm gonna kick your ass.

1403
01:21:18,878 --> 01:21:21,108
Oww! Oww!

1404
01:21:28,454 --> 01:21:30,388
All right!

1405
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:32,788
So, who's gettin'
married, huh? You?

1406
01:21:32,892 --> 01:21:36,293
All right, sweetheart.
We're gonna have some fun.

1407
01:21:36,396 --> 01:21:39,524
Here we go!

1408
01:21:49,976 --> 01:21:51,910
Aah!

1409
01:21:53,414 --> 01:21:56,315
How do I know if I want it
if I can't taste it?

1410
01:21:56,417 --> 01:21:58,578
- Do you know who I am?
- Bonnie Franklin?

1411
01:21:58,685 --> 01:22:00,619
Aaah!

1412
01:22:00,721 --> 01:22:02,621
No, you were great!
Ha-ha-ha!

1413
01:22:02,723 --> 01:22:05,624
My analyst said I should take
advantage of the time...

1414
01:22:05,726 --> 01:22:08,854
...and do something I'd always wanted to do,
so I competed in the Iditarod.

1415
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:18,495
Hyah! Hyah!

1416
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,505
We gonna take
a bathroom break?

1417
01:22:20,607 --> 01:22:23,007
We gonna-
We gonna, uh-

1418
01:22:23,110 --> 01:22:25,271
Bathroom? Oh, God.

1419
01:22:30,284 --> 01:22:33,845
So I worked on my novel and spent
some time getting to know my fans.

1420
01:22:33,954 --> 01:22:36,856
You know, give something back
to the people who got me where I am.

1421
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:39,426
Brian, this is my friend
Anne-Michelle.

1422
01:22:39,527 --> 01:22:42,087
Anne-Michelle! Hey!
What are you drinkin'?

1423
01:22:42,197 --> 01:22:45,360
'Cause I see you already
ordered the hot sauce.

1424
01:22:45,467 --> 01:22:48,959
Hey, bartender, whose leg do you have
to hump to get a dry martini around here?

1425
01:22:49,070 --> 01:22:51,470
Now do Peter.

1426
01:22:51,573 --> 01:22:55,100
Ooh, hey. Forgot my wallet.
Can one of you guys get this?

1427
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:58,111
Um, I did a guest spot
on The West Wing.

1428
01:22:58,213 --> 01:23:02,912
It's not normally what I do, but I really
got a chance to flex my dramatic muscle.

1429
01:23:03,017 --> 01:23:05,918
I got eight guys from Tallahassee
who want this bill pushed through.

1430
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:08,921
What's the latest on those refugees?
They off the coast yet?

1431
01:23:09,023 --> 01:23:12,322
We're getting a lot of Internet chatter.
We can justify raising the threat level.

1432
01:23:12,427 --> 01:23:15,328
What you do on your own time
is not my business...

1433
01:23:15,430 --> 01:23:18,332
...but, damn it, when you're here I want you
to maintain a professional veneer.

1434
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:21,335
I need to talk toJerry about how we're
gonna spin the unemployment numbers.

1435
01:23:21,437 --> 01:23:24,702
Get my wife on the phone! Tell her
I changed my mind. The blue dress is fine.

1436
01:23:24,807 --> 01:23:28,004
And I need the briefing for that meeting
on the situation in Argentina!

1437
01:23:32,781 --> 01:23:35,682
I found it!
I found the cheese!

1438
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:37,684
Oh, boy! Cheese!

1439
01:23:37,786 --> 01:23:41,187
I love you, cheese.

1440
01:23:41,290 --> 01:23:45,192
I did a lot of things, but the thing
I think I'm most proud of...

1441
01:23:45,294 --> 01:23:48,491
...is when I volunteered
to entertain the troops.

1442
01:23:51,867 --> 01:23:55,166
— If I could
turn back time —

1443
01:23:56,205 --> 01:24:00,233
— If I could find a way —

1444
01:24:00,343 --> 01:24:02,436
— I'd take back —

1445
01:24:02,546 --> 01:24:05,640
— Those words that hurt you —

1446
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:07,979
— And you'd stay —

1447
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:11,053
— If I could
reach the stars —

1448
01:24:12,455 --> 01:24:16,050
— I'd give 'em all to you —

1449
01:24:17,661 --> 01:24:19,925
—And you'd love me
Love me —

1450
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:24,433
—Like you used to do ——

1451
01:24:24,534 --> 01:24:27,435
And, Stewie,
we all know you kept busy.

1452
01:24:27,537 --> 01:24:29,437
Oh, yes,
it was exhausting...

1453
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:31,905
...between shooting films
and those damned talk shows.

1454
01:24:32,008 --> 01:24:34,909
Hee-hee!

1455
01:24:35,011 --> 01:24:37,673
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

1456
01:24:39,416 --> 01:24:43,717
I think it would
have to be... Fuck.

1457
01:24:46,524 --> 01:24:48,924
And what is
your favorite curse word?

1458
01:24:49,026 --> 01:24:50,891
Listen, cars aren't
designed for women.

1459
01:24:50,995 --> 01:24:55,694
The steering wheel would have two dents in it.
We bring our own air bags. Right, girls?

1460
01:24:57,802 --> 01:24:59,770
Anybody
like cheesecake?

1461
01:25:02,173 --> 01:25:04,801
Well, we're glad to have you
back on the air.

1462
01:25:04,909 --> 01:25:07,139
I'll let you all
enjoy the party now.

1463
01:25:07,245 --> 01:25:10,806
- Peter, is there anything else you want to say?
- Yeah, I got something to say.

1464
01:25:10,915 --> 01:25:12,815
You know,
we kid around a lot here...

1465
01:25:12,917 --> 01:25:15,317
...but the truth is,
we care about each other.

1466
01:25:15,419 --> 01:25:18,718
We're excited to be back because
we want to address some serious issues.

1467
01:25:18,823 --> 01:25:21,724
- You know, do something
we can all be proud of.

1468
01:25:21,826 --> 01:25:23,954
Peter!

1469
01:25:24,062 --> 01:25:26,030
Still got it!

1470
01:25:27,699 --> 01:25:31,430
That was me. I used to think flatulence
was something to laugh about.

1471
01:25:31,536 --> 01:25:34,437
Truth is,
300 million Americans a day...

1472
01:25:34,539 --> 01:25:36,439
...expel gas
through their anus.

1473
01:25:36,541 --> 01:25:39,271
To learn more about flatulence,
you can visit my ass.

1474
01:25:39,378 --> 01:25:42,438
Just yankin' ya!

1475
01:25:43,305 --> 01:26:43,506
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
