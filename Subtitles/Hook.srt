1
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,706
Boy, why are you crying?

2
00:00:53,919 --> 00:00:56,457
Because I couldn't
get my shadow to stick.

3
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:58,960
Besides, I wasn't crying.

4
00:00:59,215 --> 00:01:01,967
I shall sew it on for you,
my little man.

5
00:01:02,176 --> 00:01:06,091
I shall sew it on for you,
my little man. It may hurt a little.

6
00:01:06,347 --> 00:01:07,758
What's your name?

7
00:01:07,973 --> 00:01:09,931
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

8
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:12,093
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.

9
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:14,595
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.

10
00:01:14,813 --> 00:01:16,687
She's stealing the show.

11
00:01:17,524 --> 00:01:19,979
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.

12
00:01:20,193 --> 00:01:21,023
Louder!

13
00:01:21,236 --> 00:01:24,651
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.

14
00:01:24,906 --> 00:01:28,571
I shall give you a kiss if you like.

15
00:01:29,702 --> 00:01:31,694
Don't you know what a kiss is?

16
00:01:31,912 --> 00:01:34,403
I shall, once you give one to me.

17
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:42,336
Now I shall give you a kiss.

18
00:01:50,846 --> 00:01:53,966
I don't ever wanna become a man.

19
00:01:55,684 --> 00:01:58,389
I always wanna be a little boy
and have fun.

20
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:06,314
<i>We wanna be like Peter Pan</i>
<i>We don't wanna grow up</i>

21
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:10,900
Brad.

22
00:02:12,783 --> 00:02:14,657
Yeah, I'm at my daughter's play.

23
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:24,125
It's impossible. I'm on a plane
to London tomorrow night with my family.

24
00:02:24,335 --> 00:02:28,036
A children's hospital is dedicating
an entire wing to Granny Wendy.

25
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:29,252
Brad...

26
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,374
Peter, you're missing it.

27
00:02:31,592 --> 00:02:34,877
All right. I want a meeting,
tomorrow a.m.

28
00:02:35,095 --> 00:02:38,013
Dad, my game! You promised.

29
00:02:38,265 --> 00:02:40,139
Listen, it's my son's big game.

30
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:44,259
Last game of the season. Santa Series.
I gotta be there. I promised.

31
00:02:45,313 --> 00:02:46,511
We'll make it short.

32
00:02:47,023 --> 00:02:49,312
I'll be there. My word is my bond.

33
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:52,319
<i>We never, never, never</i>
<i>Never, never, never, never</i>

34
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,985
<i>Never, never, ever wanna grow up</i>

35
00:02:56,865 --> 00:02:58,657
Strike three! You're out.

36
00:03:03,538 --> 00:03:05,696
Bluejays, come on!

37
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:09,082
Jack! Come on, Bluejays!

38
00:03:09,294 --> 00:03:10,289
Bluejays!

39
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,660
Fire it up!

40
00:03:17,509 --> 00:03:20,131
Where is your father? He's missing it.

41
00:03:20,387 --> 00:03:23,672
Daddy'll be here. He promised.

42
00:03:24,057 --> 00:03:25,006
Jerry? Jack?

43
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:26,221
- Jim.
- I said that.

44
00:03:26,476 --> 00:03:29,430
Go to the game ahead of me.
Film what I miss.

45
00:03:29,646 --> 00:03:32,219
This is the speech
for your grandmother's tribute.

46
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,305
- On cards?
- Yes.

47
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:35,517
- Number those. Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.

48
00:03:35,735 --> 00:03:37,442
I loved his annual report.
Read it.

49
00:03:37,653 --> 00:03:42,315
"For the past 70 years,
the Granny Wendy we honor tonight...

50
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,782
...has given hope and care
and life to hundreds of orphans."

51
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,025
Great.

52
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,244
Mommy, where's Daddy?

53
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:01,840
My briefcase.

54
00:04:14,562 --> 00:04:15,511
Gotta fly.

55
00:04:15,771 --> 00:04:18,013
Don't worry.
More people crash in cars.

56
00:04:18,274 --> 00:04:21,808
It's a lot safer to fly
than crossing the street.

57
00:04:22,027 --> 00:04:24,316
If it's your time to go,
it's your time to go.

58
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:28,272
And remember,
don't let your arms get tired!

59
00:04:28,783 --> 00:04:31,025
What if it's the pilot's time to go?

60
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:34,201
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!
Keep us alive!

61
00:04:34,414 --> 00:04:35,279
Okay, come on!

62
00:04:35,498 --> 00:04:39,412
Hi, Mrs. Banning. I'm from the office.
Which one's your son?

63
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:42,076
- He's up to bat!
- Thank you!

64
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,589
Come on, Jack!

65
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:48,876
Come on, pal!

66
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:49,924
Come on, Jack!

67
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,970
Don't look at me! Focus!

68
00:04:52,555 --> 00:04:55,224
Stay focused! Come on, Jack.
One time, Jack.

69
00:04:56,767 --> 00:04:59,175
Come on, Jack! Come on, Jack!

70
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,722
Please, not a curve ball.

71
00:05:03,107 --> 00:05:06,974
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!

72
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:13,611
That's the game!

73
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,738
Yeah, Brad, that's real good.

74
00:06:12,712 --> 00:06:15,583
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>your captain again.</i>

75
00:06:15,799 --> 00:06:19,463
<i>Please do not allow this minor</i>
<i>turbulence to disturb you.</i>

76
00:06:29,478 --> 00:06:33,641
<i>For now, please sit back, relax.</i>
<i>Enjoy the remainder of the flight.</i>

77
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:35,102
<i>Thank you.</i>

78
00:06:35,984 --> 00:06:37,810
Look what Jack drew!

79
00:06:38,027 --> 00:06:39,605
That's very nice, dear.

80
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:40,935
What's that?

81
00:06:41,489 --> 00:06:42,319
Fire.

82
00:06:42,531 --> 00:06:44,405
Fire! Really?

83
00:06:44,658 --> 00:06:46,153
Is that our plane?

84
00:06:47,703 --> 00:06:48,817
Who are these people?

85
00:06:49,037 --> 00:06:52,620
That's Jack, that's me, that's Mom...

86
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,499
...and that's you.

87
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,658
Where's my parachute?

88
00:06:59,214 --> 00:07:02,914
- I won't make it to my birthday.
- You won't die without a phone.

89
00:07:03,134 --> 00:07:04,960
I got the phone in the briefcase.

90
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:06,499
Talk to him.

91
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:15,559
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?

92
00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,259
Take a wild guess.

93
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:19,929
- Jackie!
- Jack.

94
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,184
Will you stop?
You can break a window.

95
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:24,477
They're layered.
You can't break them.

96
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:26,398
Give me that.

97
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,532
You're afraid you'll get sucked out.

98
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,024
I'm not afraid.

99
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,700
Yes, you are. You're afraid
you'll be sucked out.

100
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,450
Just stop.

101
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:44,164
Jack, next season,
I'm coming to six games. I promise.

102
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,667
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.

103
00:07:52,721 --> 00:07:54,346
My word is my bond.

104
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:56,383
Yeah, junk bond!

105
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:02,269
When are you gonna stop
acting like a child?

106
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:04,596
I am a child.

107
00:08:04,816 --> 00:08:06,014
Grow up.

108
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,819
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

109
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,695
<i>Let's have fun, Peter.</i>

110
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,946
London's a magical place
for children.

111
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:15,901
- It was for us.
- And expensive.

112
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:18,953
Jack, don't do that.
You could put someone's eye out.

113
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:20,989
Maggie. Maggie.

114
00:08:21,206 --> 00:08:23,079
Peter, it's number 14.

115
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:24,204
Sorry.

116
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,250
What do you say to Granny Wendy?

117
00:08:26,502 --> 00:08:28,625
- "How do you do?"
- Jack, get down!

118
00:08:28,838 --> 00:08:29,869
Be careful.

119
00:08:30,422 --> 00:08:33,542
Is Granny Wendy the real,
real Wendy from my play?

120
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:34,796
No, not really.

121
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,469
Sort of.

122
00:08:36,845 --> 00:08:40,178
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.

123
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:44,097
It's time to look our best. First
impressions are the most important.

124
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:46,261
Shoes tied. Shirt tucked.

125
00:08:46,479 --> 00:08:47,724
You know this.

126
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:51,687
Remember, you're in England,
land of good manners.

127
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:52,772
Uncle Tootles.

128
00:08:52,985 --> 00:08:54,812
It's snowing!

129
00:09:05,872 --> 00:09:08,541
Look at these adorable children!

130
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,121
It's good to see you,
Libby... Linda... Lisa...

131
00:09:11,377 --> 00:09:13,369
- Liza.
- I said that.

132
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:17,125
Oh, Moira, how are you?
You look wonderful!

133
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:18,841
Oh, my God!

134
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:19,916
Look at the size...

135
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:22,293
Look at you! Such a sweet thing!

136
00:09:22,512 --> 00:09:25,845
- Granny Wendy will be right down.
- She's upstairs? Oh, good.

137
00:09:26,724 --> 00:09:30,175
- Big boy! You could play rugby.
- No, baseball.

138
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,349
Oh, look.

139
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:34,314
- Did you do this for us?
- We've been cooking all week.

140
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:37,974
You've been cooking?
What've you been cooking? Mince pies?

141
00:09:38,277 --> 00:09:40,352
Peter, look at this.
Look at this.

142
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,397
- Who's that?
- It's you.

143
00:09:42,614 --> 00:09:44,606
Was I ever that young?

144
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:48,407
- What's gotten into you?
- This house has gotten to me.

145
00:09:48,661 --> 00:09:51,994
Some of those things I was when
I was young have never left me.

146
00:09:52,248 --> 00:09:54,917
Oh, thank God!
We were children in these rooms.

147
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:57,954
Lost, lost, lost.

148
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,450
Lost what?

149
00:10:00,297 --> 00:10:02,373
I've lost my marbles.

150
00:10:04,551 --> 00:10:05,796
Lisa?

151
00:10:06,636 --> 00:10:07,585
Liza.

152
00:10:07,804 --> 00:10:10,721
- He was supposed to be in a home.
- It broke Wendy's heart.

153
00:10:10,932 --> 00:10:13,138
Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.
Which is which?

154
00:10:13,351 --> 00:10:16,387
Large bag's mine, and the smaller ones
are the children's.

155
00:10:16,645 --> 00:10:18,305
Hello, boy.

156
00:10:27,489 --> 00:10:29,232
Hello, Wendy.

157
00:10:38,123 --> 00:10:41,574
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here,
by hook or by crook.

158
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:48,665
I'm sorry it's been
so long between visits.

159
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:52,543
It's been 10 years between visits.
But never mind.

160
00:10:52,804 --> 00:10:55,176
Come and give me a skwoodge.

161
00:11:02,521 --> 00:11:04,928
Oh, Moira, Moira, Moira!

162
00:11:07,108 --> 00:11:08,602
Who is this lovely lady?

163
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,188
It can't be Maggie.

164
00:11:10,445 --> 00:11:14,312
Yes, it can. And know what?
I just played you at school.

165
00:11:14,532 --> 00:11:16,441
And don't you just look the part.

166
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:20,650
Can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year!

167
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:22,698
I'm supposed to tell you about...

168
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:27,042
...congratulations for opening
the orphan hospital...

169
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:30,585
...and how great the dedication is.

170
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:34,466
- Thank you so very much.
- Welcome.

171
00:11:34,717 --> 00:11:39,343
Now, there is one rule I insist
be obeyed while you are in my house:

172
00:11:40,014 --> 00:11:42,469
No growing up.

173
00:11:43,308 --> 00:11:46,060
Stop this very instant.

174
00:11:46,311 --> 00:11:49,395
And that includes you,
Mr. Chairman-of-the-Board Banning.

175
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:50,810
Sorry, too late, Gran.

176
00:11:51,024 --> 00:11:55,317
And what's so terribly important
about your terribly important business?

177
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,143
You see, when a big
company's in trouble...

178
00:11:58,406 --> 00:12:01,241
...Dad sails in, and if
there's any resistance...

179
00:12:01,492 --> 00:12:04,409
He's exaggerating. I'm still
into mergers and acquisitions.

180
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:07,152
And I'm dabbling in
some land development.

181
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:10,456
Any resistance and he blows them
out of the water.

182
00:12:14,003 --> 00:12:15,545
So!

183
00:12:16,297 --> 00:12:19,381
Peter, you've become a pirate!

184
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,981
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent!

185
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,775
Do you like my dress?

186
00:13:35,995 --> 00:13:37,620
Great, Gran.

187
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:40,327
Thanks.

188
00:13:41,709 --> 00:13:44,247
Hey, Brad. Good news?

189
00:13:45,254 --> 00:13:46,499
What?

190
00:13:47,298 --> 00:13:50,298
What Sierra Club report?
I thought we had these guys.

191
00:13:51,843 --> 00:13:55,508
He's trying to suck my blood!
He drools all over my neck.

192
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,753
What did they find?

193
00:13:56,973 --> 00:14:00,093
- That's a portable phone...
- A Cozy Blue Owl?

194
00:14:01,602 --> 00:14:04,769
Well, listen.

195
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:08,563
Ask them if anybody
misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

196
00:14:08,817 --> 00:14:13,028
Oh, well, I do! Boy, do I ever!
Wow, you kidding?

197
00:14:13,321 --> 00:14:14,235
Wait a minute.

198
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:18,445
You telling me a 10-inch owl
has a 50-mile mating radius?

199
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,530
Why don't they just
fornicate someplace else?

200
00:14:21,746 --> 00:14:26,573
You're telling me a 5-billion-dollar
deal is falling apart because of this?

201
00:14:27,459 --> 00:14:29,167
Somebody shoot me in the head!

202
00:14:30,003 --> 00:14:31,201
Bang! Bang!

203
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:32,874
Will everybody just shut up!

204
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,170
I'm sorry.

205
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,169
Leave me alone for one moment!

206
00:14:36,384 --> 00:14:39,302
Get them out of here!
I'm on the phone call of my life!

207
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,637
Come on, Jack. Out, out, out.

208
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,552
Come with me.

209
00:14:45,851 --> 00:14:50,762
I'll show you the window where your
dad and I used to blow out the stars.

210
00:14:53,317 --> 00:14:55,605
I should've stayed
till the deal was done.

211
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:58,316
Granny asked you to visit every year.

212
00:14:58,571 --> 00:14:59,520
I've been busy.

213
00:14:59,781 --> 00:15:04,407
You promised the children some real time
here. You haven't looked at them once.

214
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:07,655
- That's not true.
- How many more broken promises?

215
00:15:13,877 --> 00:15:16,415
It's Brad, Moira.
I gotta take this call.

216
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,619
I gotta fix this.

217
00:15:19,174 --> 00:15:21,712
No, you gotta fix your family first.

218
00:15:30,017 --> 00:15:31,595
<i>Peter, hello? Are you there?</i>

219
00:15:37,315 --> 00:15:38,560
What?

220
00:15:40,568 --> 00:15:43,320
- I'm sorry about your deal.
- You hated the deal.

221
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:47,479
I hated the deal. But I'm sorry
you feel so badly about it.

222
00:15:48,409 --> 00:15:50,401
Your children love you.

223
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,696
They want to play with you.

224
00:15:53,372 --> 00:15:55,614
How long do you think that lasts?

225
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,785
Soon Jack may not even want you
to come to his games.

226
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:04,379
We have a few special years
with our children...

227
00:16:04,591 --> 00:16:07,295
...when they're the ones
that want us around.

228
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:11,052
Then you'll be running after them
for a bit of attention.

229
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:14,173
It's so fast, Peter.

230
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,344
It's a few years, then it's over.

231
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,186
And you are not being careful.

232
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:28,560
And you are missing it.

233
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:37,118
<i>Peter, where are you?</i>

234
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,417
<i>Peter! Peter! Peter!</i>

235
00:16:45,128 --> 00:16:49,624
"All children, except one, grow up."

236
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:53,793
Now, you know where faeries come from,
don't you, Maggie?

237
00:16:54,512 --> 00:16:58,426
"When the first baby laughed
for the first time...

238
00:16:58,682 --> 00:17:01,552
...the laugh broke
into a thousand pieces...

239
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:03,933
...and they all went skipping about.

240
00:17:04,187 --> 00:17:06,559
That was the beginning of faeries."

241
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,763
And look.

242
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,151
I'm Wendy.

243
00:17:13,487 --> 00:17:15,895
Or was, a long time ago.

244
00:17:16,824 --> 00:17:20,524
But Jack says you're not
the really "real" Wendy.

245
00:17:20,744 --> 00:17:22,783
Do you see where Jack is?

246
00:17:24,497 --> 00:17:27,534
Well, that's the same window.
And this is the same room...

247
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,412
...where we made up stories about Peter,
Never Land and scary old Captain Hook.

248
00:17:32,672 --> 00:17:36,586
And do you know, Mr. Barrie, well,
Sir James, our neighbor...

249
00:17:36,842 --> 00:17:40,922
...loved our stories so much that
he wrote them all down in a book.

250
00:17:41,179 --> 00:17:44,133
Oh, dear me, 80 years ago.

251
00:17:44,724 --> 00:17:46,681
You're really old!

252
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,844
That's very true.

253
00:17:49,812 --> 00:17:52,766
I'm sorry to break this up.
I have to steal Granny...

254
00:17:52,982 --> 00:17:56,351
...or she'll be late for the most
important event of her life.

255
00:18:00,197 --> 00:18:01,525
Oh, dear.

256
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,156
Daddy, I made something for you.
You're gonna love this.

257
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:08,909
It's a hug. Next time you fly,
you won't have to be scared.

258
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:11,370
She's made you a parachute.

259
00:18:11,749 --> 00:18:13,872
That's very clever, dear.

260
00:18:15,336 --> 00:18:16,332
Get away from there!

261
00:18:16,545 --> 00:18:21,670
What have I told you about playing near
open windows? Keep this window closed.

262
00:18:21,925 --> 00:18:23,467
Do we have open windows at home?

263
00:18:23,719 --> 00:18:25,960
No. They've all got bars on them.

264
00:18:26,429 --> 00:18:27,840
Come on. Into bed.

265
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,138
Who took my baseball?

266
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:36,853
That mean, scary man
at the window stole it.

267
00:18:37,106 --> 00:18:38,269
There's no scary man.

268
00:18:38,524 --> 00:18:41,525
But he says he's a window washer.

269
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,150
What's this?

270
00:18:44,404 --> 00:18:47,191
A baseball glove.
You can catch things with it...

271
00:18:47,407 --> 00:18:50,740
...take hot things out of the oven,
hit your sister with it.

272
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:55,994
Tootles made it for me.
It smells nice.

273
00:18:56,207 --> 00:18:57,666
It's paper, honey.

274
00:19:03,797 --> 00:19:05,375
Hey, Jack.

275
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,675
Faker.

276
00:19:09,302 --> 00:19:11,342
You're in charge now.

277
00:19:11,554 --> 00:19:15,386
This is my very special watch,
so you can keep track of the time.

278
00:19:15,683 --> 00:19:18,518
Don't go out, Mom. Please.

279
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,565
Good night.

280
00:19:32,741 --> 00:19:36,608
Dear night-lights,
protect my sleeping babes.

281
00:19:36,828 --> 00:19:40,611
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.

282
00:19:44,043 --> 00:19:49,167
I read recently that they're now using
lawyers instead of rats for experiments.

283
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,501
They do this for two reasons:

284
00:19:51,758 --> 00:19:56,052
One, the scientists become
less attached to the lawyers.

285
00:19:56,971 --> 00:20:00,838
And two, there are certain things
that even rats won't do.

286
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:10,223
I thank the Board of Trustees
of the Ormond Street Hospital...

287
00:20:10,484 --> 00:20:12,523
...for having me here this evening...

288
00:20:13,111 --> 00:20:17,523
...and beg your forgiveness because
normally I address shareholders.

289
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:24,195
We don't know each other, and I doubt
that we have very much in common...

290
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:28,577
...except this wonderful woman,
Wendy Angela Darling.

291
00:20:31,378 --> 00:20:33,454
Granny Wendy brought me in
from the cold.

292
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:35,878
She taught me to read and write.

293
00:20:36,091 --> 00:20:39,175
She even found people to be
my parents and adopt me.

294
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:42,969
She's loved so many children...

295
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,641
...just so efforlete...
efforse... effortlessly.

296
00:20:48,227 --> 00:20:49,851
That's her achievement.

297
00:20:50,354 --> 00:20:53,141
Many of you here tonight
were once lost children...

298
00:20:53,356 --> 00:20:56,974
...but Granny Wendy found parents
and homes for each of you...

299
00:20:57,235 --> 00:20:58,515
...and saved you.

300
00:20:58,778 --> 00:20:59,774
That's her miracle.

301
00:21:00,988 --> 00:21:05,531
I know that if you could stand now, you
would express much better than I have...

302
00:21:05,785 --> 00:21:09,652
...your feelings of gratitude...

303
00:21:12,457 --> 00:21:14,035
...appreciation...

304
00:21:16,127 --> 00:21:18,001
...and warm feelings...

305
00:21:18,838 --> 00:21:20,712
...for this wonderful woman.

306
00:21:36,438 --> 00:21:39,059
I guess we do have
something in common.

307
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:43,025
We're orphans.

308
00:22:02,712 --> 00:22:04,704
Hook!

309
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:08,049
Hook.

310
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,321
Jack...

311
00:23:25,288 --> 00:23:26,663
You all right?

312
00:23:26,956 --> 00:23:28,201
Wendy?

313
00:23:45,014 --> 00:23:46,473
Thank you, Nigel. Norman?

314
00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:47,839
Neville, sir.

315
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:49,595
Is that English?

316
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:51,685
Merry Christmas.

317
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:55,440
I was proud of you.

318
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,855
It was a beautiful speech.

319
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:59,818
Yes, it was.

320
00:24:19,505 --> 00:24:20,880
Liza?

321
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:22,750
Tootles?

322
00:24:27,428 --> 00:24:30,050
My God! The children!

323
00:24:36,979 --> 00:24:38,806
Jack! Answer me!

324
00:24:39,064 --> 00:24:40,309
Maggie!

325
00:24:41,733 --> 00:24:45,316
The wind came up.
The door closed on me...

326
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,812
...and the children were screaming!

327
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:51,358
The children were screaming!

328
00:25:01,627 --> 00:25:02,872
The window.

329
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,172
"Dear Peter:

330
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,724
Your presence is required
at the request of your children.

331
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,305
Kindest personal regards...

332
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,183
...J.A.S. Hook...

333
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:29,056
...Captain."

334
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:37,406
Have to fly. Have to fight.

335
00:25:37,785 --> 00:25:41,782
Have to crow. Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.

336
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:44,997
Hook is back.

337
00:25:46,251 --> 00:25:47,282
Who?

338
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:49,915
Gran!

339
00:25:55,551 --> 00:25:58,256
Well, the lab boys can
analyze this little lot.

340
00:25:58,929 --> 00:26:03,887
We've wired the phones, and two
of my lads will be outside at all times.

341
00:26:04,351 --> 00:26:08,051
It's possible that this
is some kind of ridiculous prank.

342
00:26:08,313 --> 00:26:10,140
My children are missing.

343
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:14,516
Yes, but the literary history
of the family suggests...

344
00:26:14,819 --> 00:26:15,768
Let's hope...

345
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:18,063
I've forgotten how to fly.

346
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:21,195
Yeah, well, one does.

347
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,693
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

348
00:26:26,705 --> 00:26:29,540
No more happy thoughts.

349
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,995
Lost!

350
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:34,623
Lost!

351
00:26:46,807 --> 00:26:51,219
- The police will do everything they can.
- The police can do nothing.

352
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:54,806
Really? Maybe we should
call the American police.

353
00:26:55,023 --> 00:26:57,644
In a crisis, we English
always make a cup of tea.

354
00:26:57,859 --> 00:26:58,973
Moira, would you?

355
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,184
Yes, of course.

356
00:27:00,403 --> 00:27:02,691
Don't forget to warm the pot.

357
00:27:03,948 --> 00:27:05,406
I'll go.

358
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:07,909
You stay.

359
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:11,619
Don't worry, Gran Wendy,
I wasn't gonna leave.

360
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:15,410
Hand me my book, please.

361
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,545
It's time to tell you, at last.

362
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:26,670
Tell me what?

363
00:27:27,803 --> 00:27:31,670
How far back can you remember, Peter?

364
00:27:32,891 --> 00:27:35,845
I remember the hospital
on Great Ormond Street.

365
00:27:36,561 --> 00:27:38,185
You worked with orphans.

366
00:27:38,438 --> 00:27:41,889
You arranged for the adoption
by my American parents.

367
00:27:42,483 --> 00:27:44,725
You were 12, nearly 13.

368
00:27:44,985 --> 00:27:46,894
I mean, before that.

369
00:27:47,363 --> 00:27:49,022
There's nothing before that.

370
00:27:50,657 --> 00:27:52,946
Try, Peter. Do try.

371
00:27:54,911 --> 00:27:56,286
Nothing.

372
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:03,577
You know, when I was young...

373
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:09,207
...no other girl held your favor
the way I did.

374
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:16,593
I expected you to alight on the church
and forbid my vows on my wedding day.

375
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:20,683
I wore a pink satin sash.

376
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:25,264
But you didn't come.

377
00:28:26,816 --> 00:28:28,191
Grandma?

378
00:28:29,276 --> 00:28:33,320
Yes, I was an old lady
when I wrapped you in blankets.

379
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,315
A grandmother.

380
00:28:35,574 --> 00:28:38,325
With my 13-year-old granddaughter
asleep in the bed.

381
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:39,821
Moira.

382
00:28:40,662 --> 00:28:42,571
And when you saw her...

383
00:28:43,664 --> 00:28:47,247
...that was when you decided
not to go back to Never Land.

384
00:28:49,753 --> 00:28:50,916
Where?

385
00:28:51,505 --> 00:28:53,628
To Never Never Land.

386
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,251
- I'll get Moira.
- I've tried to tell you...

387
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,174
- Maybe the tea's ready.
- I knew you'd forgotten!

388
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:03,346
I'm not ready to deal with this now.

389
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:07,507
The stories are true. I swear to you.

390
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,477
I swear on everything I adore.

391
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:13,690
And now he's come back
to seek his revenge.

392
00:29:13,942 --> 00:29:16,480
The fight isn't over
for Captain James Hook.

393
00:29:16,695 --> 00:29:17,644
He wants you back.

394
00:29:17,863 --> 00:29:21,445
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack
to the ends of the earth.

395
00:29:21,658 --> 00:29:24,908
And, by heaven, you must find a way.

396
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:29,488
Only you can save your children.

397
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:33,668
Somehow, you must go back.

398
00:29:34,795 --> 00:29:38,045
You must make yourself remember.

399
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:41,591
Remember what?

400
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:47,421
Peter, don't you know who you are?

401
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:10,153
Yes, boy.

402
00:30:11,829 --> 00:30:13,074
Yes.

403
00:30:28,094 --> 00:30:29,339
Sorry.

404
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:40,015
Parachute...

405
00:31:27,524 --> 00:31:29,931
Firefly from hell!

406
00:31:32,111 --> 00:31:33,653
Big damn bug!

407
00:31:46,624 --> 00:31:49,162
It is you! It is! A big you!

408
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:51,868
It's not bad you're big.
You were always big.

409
00:31:52,088 --> 00:31:55,172
Maybe this means you'll
be twice as much fun.

410
00:31:56,467 --> 00:31:59,966
What fun we'll have again!
What times! What great games!

411
00:32:03,598 --> 00:32:05,176
You're a little...

412
00:32:07,143 --> 00:32:08,519
Faerie.

413
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,770
Pixie.

414
00:32:13,983 --> 00:32:16,652
If less is more, there's
no end to me, Peter Pan.

415
00:32:16,902 --> 00:32:17,732
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.

416
00:32:17,945 --> 00:32:18,976
- Banning.
- Pan.

417
00:32:19,196 --> 00:32:21,235
Whoever you are, it's still you.

418
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:24,028
Because only one
person has that smell.

419
00:32:24,368 --> 00:32:25,530
Smell?

420
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,151
The smell of someone
who's ridden the wind.

421
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:32,949
The smell of sleeping in trees.
Adventures with Indians and pirates.

422
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:36,702
Remember? The world was ours!
We could do everything or nothing.

423
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:39,756
I had to be anything
because it was always us.

424
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:45,880
It's happened. I'm having
a nervous breakdown.

425
00:32:46,096 --> 00:32:48,384
Follow me and
all will be well.

426
00:32:48,598 --> 00:32:52,049
I'm dying. Heading towards
the white light. I've left my body.

427
00:32:52,268 --> 00:32:54,759
There's my house down there.
There are my feet.

428
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:57,725
- Where are we going?
- To save your children!

429
00:32:58,024 --> 00:33:00,265
- How do you know about my kids?
- Everybody knows!

430
00:33:00,484 --> 00:33:03,769
Hook's got them and
you've gotta fight him! Let's fly!

431
00:33:10,410 --> 00:33:13,364
It is true, then.
You did grow up.

432
00:33:15,915 --> 00:33:19,035
I drank poison for you.
You used to call me "Tink."

433
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:22,252
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Are you in there, bug?

434
00:33:22,546 --> 00:33:24,835
I'm not a bug. I'm a faerie.

435
00:33:29,719 --> 00:33:31,628
I do not believe in faeries.

436
00:33:32,013 --> 00:33:37,007
Anytime someone says, "I do not believe
in faeries," a faerie falls down dead.

437
00:33:37,226 --> 00:33:38,970
I do not believe in faeries!!

438
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:52,779
My God, I think I killed it.

439
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,869
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!

440
00:33:57,453 --> 00:34:00,240
Clap your hands, Peter.

441
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:01,950
It's the only way to save me.

442
00:34:02,458 --> 00:34:03,833
Clap...

443
00:34:05,252 --> 00:34:06,532
Louder.

444
00:34:07,629 --> 00:34:09,040
Louder, Peter!

445
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,627
I'm clapping!

446
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,212
Oh, God, you're alive!

447
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,713
All right. Now, who am I?

448
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,016
You're a Freudian
hallucination of my mother.

449
00:34:30,233 --> 00:34:33,483
I don't know why you have wings,
but you have lovely legs.

450
00:34:33,695 --> 00:34:35,522
What am I saying?
I'm an orphan.

451
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:39,480
I've never taken drugs. I missed
the '60s. I was an accountant.

452
00:34:40,118 --> 00:34:40,983
Guess again!

453
00:34:43,704 --> 00:34:45,364
Look, stars!

454
00:34:45,581 --> 00:34:46,861
That's right, Peter.

455
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:50,118
Second star to the right
and straight on till morning.

456
00:34:51,253 --> 00:34:52,830
Never Land!

457
00:35:54,311 --> 00:35:56,434
What a nightmare!

458
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:16,081
Roll out! Roll out!

459
00:36:27,466 --> 00:36:30,882
Lovely fish! Fresh fish!

460
00:36:31,095 --> 00:36:35,009
We keep the eyes in so
they'll see you through the week!

461
00:36:39,769 --> 00:36:42,723
Excuse me. Is there
a pay phone around here?

462
00:36:43,314 --> 00:36:44,228
That is so real.

463
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,519
Peter, get back here!

464
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:47,192
Get down! Get low!

465
00:36:47,526 --> 00:36:48,558
Hide!

466
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,689
If it ain't the Mother Inferior.

467
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:55,699
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.

468
00:36:56,076 --> 00:36:59,196
I fancy them shiny
shoes for my booties.

469
00:36:59,412 --> 00:37:01,488
I think you can
get them at Armani.

470
00:37:02,624 --> 00:37:05,245
Tink! Tink! Help!

471
00:37:08,254 --> 00:37:09,962
Don't get no blood on them boots!

472
00:37:10,297 --> 00:37:11,756
They's mine!

473
00:37:11,966 --> 00:37:13,625
Help me! Tinkerbell!

474
00:37:15,094 --> 00:37:16,291
You pixie devil!

475
00:37:20,348 --> 00:37:22,756
Please don't! I have a bad back!

476
00:37:24,686 --> 00:37:26,725
You pixie devil!

477
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:36,154
Are you related
to Mighty Mouse?

478
00:37:41,618 --> 00:37:44,073
If you insist on seeing Hook...

479
00:37:44,287 --> 00:37:45,662
...do exactly what I say.

480
00:37:45,872 --> 00:37:49,122
Your left arm is dead
and hangs lifeless at your side.

481
00:37:49,709 --> 00:37:52,793
Lean on the crutch!
Left foot turned in.

482
00:37:53,045 --> 00:37:55,915
Tilt your head and
glare with your good eye!

483
00:37:56,215 --> 00:37:59,666
Now crack your mouth
and drool. Now growl!

484
00:37:59,926 --> 00:38:00,756
Growl!

485
00:38:00,969 --> 00:38:02,796
- How are you?
- Not bad, and you?

486
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:04,465
Not bad!

487
00:38:25,325 --> 00:38:28,859
Put your faces on, girls.
Here comes Smee!

488
00:38:33,082 --> 00:38:34,541
Follow that Hook!

489
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,200
Make way for the Hook!

490
00:38:38,962 --> 00:38:41,251
Me mother loves that Hook!

491
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:51,382
Give us the Hook!

492
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:55,143
Give us the Hook!

493
00:39:24,212 --> 00:39:27,296
Good morning, Never Land!

494
00:39:27,507 --> 00:39:30,591
Good morning, Mr. Smee!

495
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:33,715
Tie down the main mast, mateys.

496
00:39:34,388 --> 00:39:36,677
Because here he is!
The cunning kingfish!

497
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:38,594
The brave barracuda!

498
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:43,510
A man so deep, he's
almost unfathomable.

499
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:50,184
A man so quick,
he's even fast asleep!

500
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:51,685
Thank you!

501
00:39:51,905 --> 00:39:53,778
Let's give him a very big hand...

502
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,231
...because he's only got one.

503
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,486
I give you the
steel-handed stingray...

504
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:04,540
...Captain James Hook!

505
00:40:04,791 --> 00:40:06,665
Hook! Hook! Hook! Hook!

506
00:40:15,843 --> 00:40:17,752
See how greatly
the men favor you, sir?

507
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:21,670
The pealing spawn.
How I despise them!

508
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:23,764
Go get 'em, captain!

509
00:40:27,687 --> 00:40:28,968
Thank you!

510
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:36,190
Well, my stupid, sorry,
parasitic sacks of entrails...

511
00:40:38,948 --> 00:40:40,775
Revenge is mine.

512
00:40:42,493 --> 00:40:43,903
Long live the Hook!

513
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:47,155
I baited that Hook and
now I'm proud to announce...

514
00:40:47,372 --> 00:40:49,246
...we have his children.

515
00:40:49,791 --> 00:40:52,911
My God! Jack and Maggie.

516
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:57,376
Finally I'm going
to kill Peter Pan...

517
00:40:57,590 --> 00:41:02,133
...that cocky boy who cut off
my hand and fed it to the crocodile!

518
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,338
And who killed that
cunning crocodile? Who stuffed him?

519
00:41:06,557 --> 00:41:08,216
Who made him into a quiet clock?

520
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:11,469
Who went to the other world
and stole Pan's children?

521
00:41:12,145 --> 00:41:14,434
And who didn't
believe I could do it?

522
00:41:15,148 --> 00:41:16,725
Who doubted me?

523
00:41:17,817 --> 00:41:20,059
Who amongst us does not belong?

524
00:41:20,778 --> 00:41:22,605
Someone here does not belong.

525
00:41:22,822 --> 00:41:25,491
Stranger amongst the loyal,
I'll weed you out.

526
00:41:28,702 --> 00:41:29,817
You!

527
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,499
You!

528
00:41:39,712 --> 00:41:41,503
Where's the carpet, Smee?

529
00:41:41,714 --> 00:41:43,208
Sorry, sir.

530
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:47,166
You!

531
00:41:47,636 --> 00:41:49,344
You! That's right, you!

532
00:41:49,555 --> 00:41:51,843
No, not you! Not you.

533
00:41:52,974 --> 00:41:54,255
You.

534
00:41:55,143 --> 00:41:56,139
You!

535
00:41:59,063 --> 00:42:02,598
You bet against me bringing
Pan back here, didn't you?

536
00:42:04,777 --> 00:42:06,983
Tell your captain the truth.

537
00:42:11,033 --> 00:42:12,990
Say it. Say it.

538
00:42:13,952 --> 00:42:15,114
I did.

539
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,327
- You made a boo-boo.
- I did.

540
00:42:18,456 --> 00:42:21,789
- The Boo Box.
- Not the Boo Box!

541
00:42:39,184 --> 00:42:40,346
Boo!

542
00:42:44,689 --> 00:42:46,017
Put me down!

543
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:50,359
I want my mommy!
I want my daddy!

544
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:52,688
Hello, children.

545
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:55,312
Comfy? Cozy?

546
00:42:55,574 --> 00:42:58,243
Those are my kids!

547
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,360
Those are my kids!

548
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:06,821
Everything's gonna be all right.

549
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,961
It's all right. Daddy's here.

550
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:14,460
I want those kids out of that net
or you better get an attorney.

551
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:15,754
Who are you?

552
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:18,339
I'm Peter Banning.
I want my children.

553
00:43:18,553 --> 00:43:19,751
Those are your?

554
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:21,471
These are your children?

555
00:43:21,806 --> 00:43:22,837
And you're?

556
00:43:23,057 --> 00:43:23,971
You're Peter?

557
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:26,223
You're Peter? No!

558
00:43:26,978 --> 00:43:29,931
- You're Peter?
- Is there an echo in here? Yes!

559
00:43:30,147 --> 00:43:32,685
My great and worthy opponent?

560
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:36,058
Who is this impostor?

561
00:43:36,278 --> 00:43:39,065
Peter flogging flying Pan!

562
00:43:40,448 --> 00:43:43,532
I'm not Peter Pan.
I am just an ordinary...

563
00:43:43,785 --> 00:43:45,991
I've got a sworn
affidavit by a T. Bell.

564
00:43:46,287 --> 00:43:49,786
I've got his medical history.
I even got his dental records.

565
00:43:50,708 --> 00:43:53,163
Are you trying to
do me out of my job?

566
00:43:53,377 --> 00:43:55,665
May I show you something?
Will you let go?

567
00:43:55,879 --> 00:43:57,042
Release him.

568
00:43:57,255 --> 00:43:59,793
- May I show you this?
- Will you shut him up.

569
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,923
- Captain, put these on.
- I want to see the scar.

570
00:44:07,139 --> 00:44:08,468
The hypertrophy.

571
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:12,682
Here's where you sliced him
during the Tiger Lily incident.

572
00:44:12,895 --> 00:44:14,009
That's my appendix!

573
00:44:14,229 --> 00:44:15,261
What's this?

574
00:44:15,481 --> 00:44:20,605
Faerie footprints. He's Peter Pan
or I've got a dead man's dinghy.

575
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:25,648
Is it you?

576
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,407
My great and worthy opponent?

577
00:44:30,202 --> 00:44:32,325
But it can't be.

578
00:44:33,205 --> 00:44:35,910
Not this pitiful,
spineless, pasty, bloated...

579
00:44:36,166 --> 00:44:39,202
...codfish I see before me.

580
00:44:39,711 --> 00:44:42,747
You're not even
a shadow of Peter Pan.

581
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:49,258
You have an obligation to
clarify this Pan problem.

582
00:44:49,470 --> 00:44:50,300
This disaster.

583
00:44:50,513 --> 00:44:52,386
- Which must be remedied.
- Expediently.

584
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:54,887
I want my children.
The stakes can be no higher.

585
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:59,429
For me, sir, they could have
sunk no lower. And I want my war!

586
00:44:59,646 --> 00:45:01,306
Blow him out
of the water!

587
00:45:01,815 --> 00:45:03,938
Daddy's handling this. It's okay.

588
00:45:05,443 --> 00:45:06,724
Pick up your weapon.

589
00:45:11,782 --> 00:45:13,111
How much?

590
00:45:22,125 --> 00:45:24,450
Hoist and raise the kiddies!

591
00:45:32,051 --> 00:45:35,716
I'll make you a deal,
Mr. Chairman. Fly up there...

592
00:45:35,930 --> 00:45:39,974
...and touch the fingers of your
children, and I'll set them free.

593
00:45:40,309 --> 00:45:41,388
I can't fly.

594
00:45:41,601 --> 00:45:45,101
Explode out of there! Stop
this charade! Free your children!

595
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:51,150
I beg your pardon?

596
00:45:53,321 --> 00:45:54,696
You must be joking.

597
00:45:56,490 --> 00:46:00,322
Peter Pan has a
real problem with heights.

598
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:03,242
I'm not Peter Pan.

599
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,245
It's okay. Hang on, son.
I'm coming, sweetheart.

600
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:10,543
- Somebody give me a hand.
- I already have.

601
00:46:20,304 --> 00:46:21,679
Save us, Daddy!

602
00:46:21,889 --> 00:46:24,296
"Save me, Daddy!"

603
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,134
We know who you are!
What new game is this, Peter? Fly!

604
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:31,346
Stop pretending!

605
00:46:34,483 --> 00:46:36,393
Fly! I know it's you!

606
00:46:42,032 --> 00:46:44,949
Be the Pan you are. Fly!

607
00:46:45,243 --> 00:46:47,070
Fly! Think a happy thought.

608
00:46:47,537 --> 00:46:51,451
Just touch our fingers
and we'll be able to go home.

609
00:46:51,916 --> 00:46:55,616
Touch them, Peter, and
it's all been just a bad dream!

610
00:46:55,836 --> 00:46:58,292
Just reach out and touch them!

611
00:47:00,883 --> 00:47:02,922
Flap your arm and fly!

612
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:06,881
Reach!

613
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:09,380
Come on, Daddy.
Mommy could do it.

614
00:47:14,312 --> 00:47:18,012
I don't understand. Why doesn't
he fly? He's a fop Peter Pan!

615
00:47:18,232 --> 00:47:20,984
He's Peter Pan, all right, captain.

616
00:47:21,193 --> 00:47:25,570
He's been away from Never Land so
long, his mind's been gentrified.

617
00:47:25,781 --> 00:47:27,857
He's forgotten everything.

618
00:47:33,705 --> 00:47:36,030
Please don't give up.

619
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:50,635
I want to go home.

620
00:47:54,265 --> 00:47:58,761
Gentlemen, I'm afraid
I have decided to cancel the war.

621
00:47:59,895 --> 00:48:02,932
He can't fly, but he can swim!

622
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:04,816
Kill them.

623
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:06,688
Kill them all.

624
00:48:08,111 --> 00:48:09,605
Bring on the plank!

625
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:16,904
And I never want to
hear the name Peter Pan again!

626
00:48:19,372 --> 00:48:22,906
What about the name Hook? Do you
want to be remembered as a bully?

627
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:25,960
Or as the great warrior
who defeated a heroic Pan?

628
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:32,833
One week and I'll get him in shape,
and you can have your dirty old war.

629
00:48:33,635 --> 00:48:38,178
It's a trick, captain! Let me blast
that buzzing vixen to pixie hell!

630
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,842
You promised people
the war of the century.

631
00:48:44,061 --> 00:48:47,596
Your whole life has been building
to this. Mortal combat, glory!

632
00:48:47,856 --> 00:48:49,054
Hook versus Pan!

633
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:51,730
That is not Pan.

634
00:49:05,456 --> 00:49:06,405
Two days.

635
00:49:06,957 --> 00:49:09,413
Four. Bare minimum
for a decent Pan.

636
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:11,283
Three. Final offer.

637
00:49:12,462 --> 00:49:13,625
Done.

638
00:49:15,256 --> 00:49:17,213
And you'd better deliver, Miss Bell...

639
00:49:17,425 --> 00:49:22,087
...or no amount of clapping will bring
you back from where I will send you.

640
00:49:24,515 --> 00:49:25,464
Hear me, men.

641
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:28,637
I've decided that the so-called Pan...

642
00:49:28,894 --> 00:49:32,345
...will return in three days to commence
the arbitrament of the sword.

643
00:49:32,564 --> 00:49:33,679
Smee, translate.

644
00:49:33,899 --> 00:49:35,772
In three days we'll have a war.

645
00:49:35,984 --> 00:49:39,269
A battle between
good and evil, to the death.

646
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,618
Help me!

647
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:31,370
Snow!

648
00:51:35,344 --> 00:51:36,589
What?

649
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:38,716
What?

650
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,645
Help!

651
00:51:57,865 --> 00:51:58,896
Get me down!

652
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,281
Oh, you're alive!

653
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,027
Oh, get me down!

654
00:52:07,373 --> 00:52:08,404
I believe!

655
00:52:08,624 --> 00:52:10,783
Lost Boys! Lost Boys! Wake up!

656
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:19,295
Pan's back!

657
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:22,007
Lost Boys! Lost Boys! Wake up!

658
00:52:23,263 --> 00:52:25,136
That was my pillow!

659
00:52:26,432 --> 00:52:27,927
I'm up.

660
00:52:30,228 --> 00:52:32,434
Wake up, you sleepyheads!

661
00:52:32,938 --> 00:52:36,141
Pan's back! Pan's back! Pan!

662
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:47,320
Pan!

663
00:52:52,331 --> 00:52:54,739
Who's the shrub?

664
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:57,622
Bangerang!

665
00:53:06,303 --> 00:53:07,927
That ain't Peter Pan.

666
00:53:08,179 --> 00:53:09,045
He's old.

667
00:53:09,305 --> 00:53:10,384
He's fat!

668
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,348
Not so fat to me.

669
00:53:12,892 --> 00:53:15,809
He's an old, fat grandpa man.

670
00:53:21,525 --> 00:53:22,723
Rufio!

671
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:33,116
That is so dangerous.

672
00:53:37,373 --> 00:53:39,780
That's enough!

673
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:42,168
Okay, mister. All right.

674
00:53:42,377 --> 00:53:44,868
The show's over.
Put that thing away!

675
00:53:45,088 --> 00:53:47,626
Put it down before
you poke somebody's eye out.

676
00:53:47,841 --> 00:53:51,256
You're not old enough to shave.
What are you doing with that sword?

677
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:55,716
This is an insurance nightmare! What's
this? <i>Lord of the Flies</i> preschool?

678
00:53:56,349 --> 00:53:58,092
Where are your parents?

679
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:00,135
Who's in charge here?

680
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:06,929
No, Mr. Skunkhead-with-too-much-mousse,
you're just a punk kid.

681
00:54:07,192 --> 00:54:09,231
I want to speak to a grownup!

682
00:54:09,486 --> 00:54:11,359
All grownups are pirates!

683
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:12,401
Excuse me?

684
00:54:13,031 --> 00:54:14,822
We kill pirates.

685
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:17,741
I'm not a pirate.

686
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:20,692
It so happens I am a lawyer.

687
00:54:21,747 --> 00:54:23,786
Kill the lawyer!

688
00:54:24,708 --> 00:54:26,700
I'm not that kind of lawyer.

689
00:54:49,856 --> 00:54:51,730
I've been shot!

690
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:57,352
Help!

691
00:54:57,572 --> 00:54:59,647
Help me, somebody!

692
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:07,117
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!

693
00:55:07,331 --> 00:55:09,703
Hook's kidnapped his kids.
He's just out of shape.

694
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:12,283
We have to make him bangerang!

695
00:55:12,836 --> 00:55:14,828
No, no! Please stop!

696
00:55:16,214 --> 00:55:17,756
Why are you doing this to me?

697
00:55:18,216 --> 00:55:21,549
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.
Please teach him.

698
00:55:21,761 --> 00:55:24,049
We gotta make him remember.

699
00:55:37,358 --> 00:55:38,188
Excuse me.

700
00:55:52,622 --> 00:55:53,903
Help me!

701
00:55:54,165 --> 00:55:55,957
Not you!

702
00:56:21,566 --> 00:56:22,894
Oh, my! A wall.

703
00:56:34,411 --> 00:56:36,699
Lost Boys, stop! Stop it!

704
00:56:43,669 --> 00:56:44,499
Play!

705
00:56:46,297 --> 00:56:47,411
Play.

706
00:57:11,403 --> 00:57:14,570
You're dead, jolly man.

707
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,947
He can't do those things.
He can't even play simple games.

708
00:57:19,202 --> 00:57:22,072
Hook has got his kids,
and I've got three days...

709
00:57:22,288 --> 00:57:25,621
...to get him ready to fight.
And I need everybody's help.

710
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:29,208
Peter Pan's got kids?

711
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:40,888
He can't fly, fight or crow.

712
00:57:42,890 --> 00:57:46,888
If any of you says this here
scug ain't Peter Pan...

713
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:48,348
...cross the line.

714
00:57:55,736 --> 00:57:58,024
What? I'll be right back.

715
00:57:59,281 --> 00:58:00,479
What?

716
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:02,940
You are embarrassing me!

717
00:59:16,643 --> 00:59:19,099
Oh, there you are, Peter!

718
00:59:38,205 --> 00:59:39,533
But, Peter...

719
00:59:39,790 --> 00:59:43,657
...you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.

720
00:59:48,423 --> 00:59:50,380
His nose got real big.

721
00:59:50,633 --> 00:59:54,298
Well, welcome back to Never Land,
Pan the Man.

722
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,840
Don't listen to that faerie
and that brainless fungus!

723
00:59:58,098 --> 01:00:00,767
I got Pan's sword! I'm the Pan now!

724
01:00:01,018 --> 01:00:05,015
You think this guy's
gonna take it from me? Rufio?

725
01:00:06,690 --> 01:00:10,354
Wait! If Tink believes, maybe he is.

726
01:00:15,948 --> 01:00:20,775
Are you gonna follow this drooler
against <i>Capitan</i> Hook?

727
01:00:21,453 --> 01:00:26,245
What's he doing here if he's not Peter
Pan, huh? He don't look happy here.

728
01:00:26,499 --> 01:00:29,536
And who are them kids Hook's got?
Give him a chance!

729
01:00:29,794 --> 01:00:34,123
Those are my kids, and Hook's
gonna kill them unless we do something.

730
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:38,632
Help me. Please.

731
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,841
Yeah, come on! Give him a chance!

732
01:00:47,978 --> 01:00:50,385
Well, I should claw myself
with my own hook.

733
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:54,139
Not to kill Pan when I had the chance!

734
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,895
What have I done?
What have I done, Smee?

735
01:00:58,404 --> 01:01:01,903
Agreed to a preposterous plan,
an absurd war.

736
01:01:02,157 --> 01:01:05,656
Now I'm bound by my
indefatigable good form to wait.

737
01:01:05,911 --> 01:01:08,746
- I'll fix you a nice plate.
- Wait for what?

738
01:01:08,997 --> 01:01:14,121
Whether it be three days or three
decades, he'll always be a fat, old Pan.

739
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:19,414
I hate being disappointed, Smee.
And I hate living in this flawed body!

740
01:01:19,632 --> 01:01:22,039
And I hate living in Never Land!

741
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:24,382
And I hate, I hate...

742
01:01:24,636 --> 01:01:28,965
...I hate Peter Pan!

743
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:34,725
Smee? Smee?

744
01:01:36,898 --> 01:01:39,567
I've just had a sublime vision.

745
01:01:44,154 --> 01:01:46,396
All the jagged parts of my life...

746
01:01:46,657 --> 01:01:51,283
...have come together to form
a complete and mystical whole.

747
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,074
An epiphany.

748
01:01:55,957 --> 01:01:57,202
A "piphy" what?

749
01:01:58,334 --> 01:02:00,291
My life is over.

750
01:02:00,503 --> 01:02:01,783
You've lost your appetite?

751
01:02:02,213 --> 01:02:03,623
Yes.

752
01:02:03,881 --> 01:02:05,126
Goodbye.

753
01:02:06,508 --> 01:02:08,964
Where're you going?
Are you getting dramatic?

754
01:02:09,177 --> 01:02:10,256
Goodbye, Smee.

755
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:13,429
Captain, why don't we
play with your island?

756
01:02:13,973 --> 01:02:17,805
All the little Indians and
the soldiers and all the Lost Boys?

757
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:20,267
Here we go.

758
01:02:22,022 --> 01:02:25,107
No stopping me this time, Smee.

759
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:26,473
This is it.

760
01:02:26,693 --> 01:02:29,943
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.

761
01:02:30,363 --> 01:02:34,147
My finger's on the trigger.
Don't try to stop me, Smee.

762
01:02:34,409 --> 01:02:35,607
Oh, not again.

763
01:02:35,827 --> 01:02:36,657
This is it.

764
01:02:36,995 --> 01:02:42,036
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.

765
01:02:42,249 --> 01:02:46,496
Don't you dare try to stop me
this time, Smee. Try to stop me.

766
01:02:47,963 --> 01:02:50,714
You better get up off your ass.
Get over here!

767
01:02:50,966 --> 01:02:52,424
- I'm coming!
- Stop me!

768
01:02:52,634 --> 01:02:56,050
This is not a joke!
I'm committing suicide!

769
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:02,424
Don't ever frighten me like that again.

770
01:03:02,643 --> 01:03:04,470
- Sorry.
- What are you, a sadist?

771
01:03:04,687 --> 01:03:06,560
I'm sorry. How do you feel now?

772
01:03:07,189 --> 01:03:09,644
- I want to die.
- Oh, now, now.

773
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:12,645
- There's no adventure here.
- You call this "no adventure"?

774
01:03:12,861 --> 01:03:15,103
Death is the only
great adventure I have left.

775
01:03:15,363 --> 01:03:16,941
Let's get you into bed.

776
01:03:17,157 --> 01:03:18,236
It's all over.

777
01:03:18,449 --> 01:03:21,699
- I'm so tired.
- Don't upset yourself, captain.

778
01:03:21,953 --> 01:03:24,526
My career is over.

779
01:03:24,789 --> 01:03:27,659
This was supposed to be the war
to end all wars.

780
01:03:27,916 --> 01:03:30,870
- And it will be, captain.
- The ultimate war.

781
01:03:33,296 --> 01:03:37,045
There must be a way to get at him,
to get even with him...

782
01:03:37,300 --> 01:03:40,005
...to get him where
it really would hurt.

783
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:44,299
There must be something I haven't
thought of. Where is he vulnerable?

784
01:03:45,141 --> 01:03:48,307
No more talk about
doing away with yourself.

785
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:52,012
I mean, what would the world be like
without Captain Hook?

786
01:03:52,606 --> 01:03:54,729
Indeed. Good form, Smee.

787
01:03:55,192 --> 01:03:59,568
- What would the world be like without me?
- There you go.

788
01:03:59,821 --> 01:04:01,647
I'm ready for my nightcap.

789
01:04:01,906 --> 01:04:04,611
Abso-flogging-lutely.

790
01:04:04,825 --> 01:04:07,399
I think a bit of skulduggery
would do you good.

791
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:10,407
Take your mind off this Pan business.

792
01:04:10,622 --> 01:04:14,620
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll
shoot some Indians out at Long Tom.

793
01:04:14,835 --> 01:04:18,535
I'm tired of killing Indians
and Lost Boys. I always kill them.

794
01:04:18,797 --> 01:04:21,548
I want to kill Peter Pan.
I wanna kill him!

795
01:04:21,758 --> 01:04:24,331
Hear me? I want to kill him.

796
01:04:24,552 --> 01:04:26,212
Oh, dear.

797
01:04:35,354 --> 01:04:36,978
I've just had an apostrophe.

798
01:04:37,189 --> 01:04:39,228
I think you mean an "epiphany."

799
01:04:39,649 --> 01:04:42,603
Lightning has just struck my brain.

800
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:44,568
Well, that must hurt.

801
01:04:44,779 --> 01:04:47,696
- Pan's kids...
- What about them?

802
01:04:52,369 --> 01:04:53,911
You could make them like you.

803
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:55,861
Say, what?

804
01:04:56,081 --> 01:04:58,120
No, no, no.

805
01:05:02,879 --> 01:05:06,497
We could make
the little buggers love you.

806
01:05:07,383 --> 01:05:10,300
No little children love me.

807
01:05:10,511 --> 01:05:13,761
- Captain, that is the point.
- What do you mean?

808
01:05:13,972 --> 01:05:17,056
That is the ultimate revenge.

809
01:05:17,267 --> 01:05:20,054
- What is?
- Pan's kids in love with Hook.

810
01:05:20,270 --> 01:05:21,681
What're you getting on about?

811
01:05:21,938 --> 01:05:24,014
- It's the ultimate payback.
- What is?

812
01:05:24,232 --> 01:05:25,430
Imagine Pan...

813
01:05:25,692 --> 01:05:29,025
...when he faces you, and his kids...

814
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:30,647
...standing beside you...

815
01:05:30,905 --> 01:05:35,780
...ready to fight for the sleaziest
sleaze of the seven seas, Captain Hook.

816
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:39,617
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Yes, I see.

817
01:05:40,288 --> 01:05:41,486
You know, Smee...

818
01:05:41,748 --> 01:05:45,532
...I like it, I like it, I like it!

819
01:05:45,752 --> 01:05:48,622
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea
I've just had!

820
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:52,379
Tomorrow, I'll make Pan's brats love me.

821
01:05:52,633 --> 01:05:55,717
Peter Pan will fly again.
He'll remember how.

822
01:05:55,969 --> 01:05:59,634
And if he doesn't, those dirty
Lost Boys will jog his memory.

823
01:05:59,848 --> 01:06:04,225
Oh, yes, you'll see.
He'll crow, he'll fight, he'll fly...

824
01:06:04,436 --> 01:06:07,353
...and then, he'll die.

825
01:06:16,947 --> 01:06:18,192
<i>Pick 'em up</i>

826
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:19,859
<i>Move 'em down</i>

827
01:06:20,158 --> 01:06:21,617
<i>Pick 'em on up</i>

828
01:06:21,827 --> 01:06:23,534
<i>Move 'em on down</i>

829
01:06:23,745 --> 01:06:26,829
<i>Ain't no time to celebrate</i>

830
01:06:27,081 --> 01:06:30,117
<i>You are old and overweight</i>

831
01:06:30,418 --> 01:06:33,454
<i>Gotta lose a million pounds</i>

832
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:38,249
<i>Get your fat butt off the ground</i>
<i>Reach on down and touch your toes</i>

833
01:06:38,509 --> 01:06:41,842
<i>How long since you looked at those?</i>

834
01:06:42,095 --> 01:06:43,376
<i>Shape up</i>

835
01:06:43,597 --> 01:06:45,091
<i>Lose weight</i>

836
01:06:45,306 --> 01:06:46,635
<i>Get thin</i>

837
01:06:46,850 --> 01:06:47,679
<i>Gotta win</i>

838
01:06:47,892 --> 01:06:52,601
<i>Jumping jacks are good for you</i>
<i>Now your face is turning blue</i>

839
01:06:52,855 --> 01:06:55,891
<i>Swing your arms around your back</i>

840
01:06:56,108 --> 01:06:59,109
<i>Give yourself a heart attack</i>
<i>Gotta train</i>

841
01:06:59,361 --> 01:07:00,903
<i>In the rain</i>

842
01:07:01,154 --> 01:07:02,399
<i>In the sun</i>

843
01:07:02,656 --> 01:07:04,233
<i>In the snow</i>

844
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:06,655
<i>Ten below</i>
<i>Gotta move</i>

845
01:07:06,868 --> 01:07:08,576
<i>Gotta do</i>
<i>Gotta grow</i>

846
01:07:10,580 --> 01:07:12,619
Go easy on me. I'm a beginner.

847
01:07:12,832 --> 01:07:14,030
Low! High! High!

848
01:07:17,878 --> 01:07:20,748
All right, gramps.
Give it your best shot.

849
01:07:21,006 --> 01:07:23,378
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen. Learn.

850
01:07:23,759 --> 01:07:25,965
Okay, you ready?
I don't wanna hurt you.

851
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:31,681
Watch your skin!

852
01:07:32,016 --> 01:07:33,179
Be bangerang, old man.

853
01:07:46,446 --> 01:07:49,696
What are you doing? How does this
help me get my kids back?

854
01:07:49,908 --> 01:07:51,318
What do I have to do next?

855
01:07:51,576 --> 01:07:56,072
Next, time to fly.

856
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:05,829
Just think happy thoughts.

857
01:08:06,047 --> 01:08:09,997
All you need is one happy thought,
Peter, and it'll make you fly.

858
01:08:11,010 --> 01:08:12,469
I got it!

859
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:16,761
Not being in this slingshot
would make me very happy!

860
01:08:18,684 --> 01:08:20,095
He's going up!

861
01:08:20,352 --> 01:08:22,677
He's coming down!

862
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:29,766
Now, pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.

863
01:08:29,986 --> 01:08:34,814
"Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children."

864
01:08:37,368 --> 01:08:38,566
Anyone?

865
01:08:39,412 --> 01:08:41,783
Doesn't Mommy read to us every night?

866
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:46,250
You, the cute little urchin
in the front row...

867
01:08:46,918 --> 01:08:50,583
Won't you share your thoughts
with the whole class?

868
01:08:50,797 --> 01:08:51,627
Yes.

869
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:54,591
I said Mommy reads to us every night...

870
01:08:54,801 --> 01:08:57,292
...because she loves us very much.

871
01:08:57,512 --> 01:08:59,171
Loves you?
Isn't that...

872
01:09:00,389 --> 01:09:02,512
The "L" word, captain.

873
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,216
No, child.

874
01:09:04,435 --> 01:09:09,180
Your mother reads to you every night
in order to stupefy you to sleep...

875
01:09:09,481 --> 01:09:13,478
...so that she and Daddy can sit down
for three minutes without you...

876
01:09:13,735 --> 01:09:18,811
...and your mindless, inexhaustible,
unstoppable, repetitive demands:

877
01:09:19,073 --> 01:09:20,651
"He took my toy."

878
01:09:20,908 --> 01:09:22,153
"She hid my bear."

879
01:09:22,409 --> 01:09:26,277
"I want to potty. I want a cookie.
I want to stay up."

880
01:09:26,538 --> 01:09:29,111
"I want, I want, I want!"
"Me, me, me, me!"

881
01:09:29,332 --> 01:09:31,289
"Mine, mine, mine, mine!"

882
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:34,502
"Now, now, now!"

883
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:37,547
Can't you understand, child?

884
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:42,135
- They tell you stories to shut you up.
- And conk you out.

885
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:46,004
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!

886
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:48,595
Lie? Me?

887
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:52,138
Never!

888
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:56,147
The truth is far too much fun.

889
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:03,984
Before you were born, your parents
would stay up all night together...

890
01:10:04,323 --> 01:10:05,901
...just to see the sunrise.

891
01:10:06,158 --> 01:10:07,237
Don't be frightened.

892
01:10:07,451 --> 01:10:12,575
Maggie, before you were born,
they were happier.

893
01:10:13,248 --> 01:10:14,991
They were free.

894
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:18,705
You are a bad man.

895
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,711
Smee, flunk the maggot.

896
01:10:21,005 --> 01:10:22,499
Abso-flogging-lutely.

897
01:10:22,757 --> 01:10:24,464
An "F"?

898
01:10:27,177 --> 01:10:29,253
He gave me an "F"!

899
01:10:31,765 --> 01:10:34,968
Your father went to your sister's
school play, did he not?

900
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:39,060
But did he go to your baseball game?

901
01:10:41,732 --> 01:10:43,227
How'd you know about that?

902
01:10:43,484 --> 01:10:48,027
He missed the most important game
on the most important day...

903
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:50,522
...of your young life.

904
01:10:52,326 --> 01:10:54,448
- I wanna tear your hook off!
- Easy.

905
01:10:54,661 --> 01:10:57,116
I hate, I hate you, Mr. Hook!

906
01:10:57,914 --> 01:11:00,998
What did I tell you, Smee?
No little children love me.

907
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,448
Of course they do.

908
01:11:02,710 --> 01:11:05,035
Come on.
You're depressing the captain.

909
01:11:05,254 --> 01:11:09,583
Jack, listen to me! Never let him
make you forget! Never forget...

910
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:11,175
...Mommy and Daddy!

911
01:11:11,385 --> 01:11:14,800
Think of a way to run home, Jack!
Run home!

912
01:11:15,013 --> 01:11:16,211
Run home?

913
01:11:20,435 --> 01:11:22,226
You are home.

914
01:11:25,106 --> 01:11:26,268
Right?

915
01:11:41,496 --> 01:11:43,287
Oh, yeah.

916
01:12:10,022 --> 01:12:12,477
No, no, no.
We don't use them.

917
01:12:12,691 --> 01:12:16,226
- Why do you have them?
- So we don't have to use them.

918
01:12:17,029 --> 01:12:19,151
Don't crowd me!

919
01:12:19,531 --> 01:12:20,941
Come on, Thud Butt!

920
01:12:33,085 --> 01:12:34,200
Everybody say grace.

921
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,249
Bless this, Lord...

922
01:12:35,462 --> 01:12:37,087
Grace!

923
01:12:46,347 --> 01:12:48,387
All of my favorite Never Foods!

924
01:12:48,641 --> 01:12:52,638
Yams, mamey apples and banana squash!

925
01:12:52,978 --> 01:12:57,106
Wash it down, calabash and papaw!

926
01:13:01,278 --> 01:13:02,937
Can you blow on this?

927
01:13:03,822 --> 01:13:04,687
Thank you.

928
01:13:29,595 --> 01:13:31,469
This is good!

929
01:13:44,317 --> 01:13:45,859
Are you eating that?

930
01:13:48,154 --> 01:13:49,862
No, please.

931
01:13:50,865 --> 01:13:51,861
Eat!

932
01:13:52,241 --> 01:13:54,317
What's the deal?
Where's the real food?

933
01:13:54,535 --> 01:13:58,782
If you can't imagine yourself being
Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!

934
01:13:58,997 --> 01:14:01,915
Eat what? There's nothing here.
Gandhi ate more than this.

935
01:14:02,125 --> 01:14:04,283
This used to be your favorite game.

936
01:14:04,502 --> 01:14:07,420
Forget the games. I want real food!
Steak, eggs...

937
01:14:07,630 --> 01:14:12,375
You can't. Eat your heart out,
you crinkled, wrinkled fat bag!

938
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:15,422
- You're very ill-mannered...
- You're a slug-eating worm.

939
01:14:15,638 --> 01:14:17,013
You can do better than that!

940
01:14:17,389 --> 01:14:18,504
You're encouraging them?

941
01:14:18,724 --> 01:14:23,469
Show me your fastball, dust brain!
You paunchy, sag-bottomed puke pot!

942
01:14:23,728 --> 01:14:25,768
Bangerang, Rufio!

943
01:14:25,981 --> 01:14:28,898
You're a very poor role model
for these kids, you know?

944
01:14:32,195 --> 01:14:34,234
You don't have
a fourth-grade reading level.

945
01:14:34,447 --> 01:14:37,447
- Hemorrhoidal sucknavel.
- Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.

946
01:14:40,619 --> 01:14:44,070
Oil-dripping, beef-fart
sniffing bubble butt.

947
01:14:46,208 --> 01:14:48,533
Someone has a severe caca mouth.
You know that?

948
01:14:48,752 --> 01:14:50,376
You are a fart factory!

949
01:14:50,628 --> 01:14:54,127
Slug-slime sack
of rat guts and cat vomit...

950
01:14:54,382 --> 01:14:55,580
...cheesy scab...

951
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:58,125
...picked pimple-squeezing
finger bandage!

952
01:14:58,344 --> 01:15:03,468
A week-old maggot burger with
everything on it and flies on the side!

953
01:15:05,725 --> 01:15:07,303
Substitute chemistry teacher.

954
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:09,725
Come on, Rufio, hit him back.

955
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:11,310
Mung tongue!

956
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:14,724
- Math tutor.
- Pinhead.

957
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:16,985
- Prison barber.
- Mother lover.

958
01:15:17,194 --> 01:15:18,309
Nearsighted gynecologist.

959
01:15:18,529 --> 01:15:21,102
- In your face, camelcake!
- In your rear, cow derrière!

960
01:15:21,323 --> 01:15:23,363
Lying, crying, spying,
prying ultra-pig!

961
01:15:23,575 --> 01:15:25,532
Lewd, crude bag
of pre-chewed food dude.

962
01:15:25,744 --> 01:15:27,404
Bangerang, Peter!

963
01:15:30,415 --> 01:15:32,988
You man! Stupid, stupid man!

964
01:15:33,209 --> 01:15:36,079
If I'm a maggot burger,
why don't you just eat me?

965
01:15:36,671 --> 01:15:40,502
You zebra-headed, slime-coated,
pimple-farming, paramecium brain...

966
01:15:40,758 --> 01:15:44,506
...munching on your own mucus,
suffering from Peter Pan envy!

967
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:46,130
What's a "paramecium brain"?

968
01:15:46,346 --> 01:15:49,300
I'll tell you what a paramecium is!
That's a paramecium!

969
01:15:49,516 --> 01:15:52,801
It's a one-celled critter
with no brain that can't fly!

970
01:15:53,061 --> 01:15:55,812
Don't mess with me, man!
I'm a lawyer!

971
01:15:56,022 --> 01:15:57,813
Banning, Banning!

972
01:16:02,736 --> 01:16:05,309
Rufio! Rufio!

973
01:16:11,411 --> 01:16:15,658
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just
go suck on a dead dog's nose?

974
01:16:23,839 --> 01:16:25,417
You're doing it.

975
01:16:25,841 --> 01:16:29,790
- Doing what?
- Using your imagination, Peter.

976
01:16:55,952 --> 01:17:01,076
You're playing with us, Peter.
You're doing it, Peter.

977
01:17:22,226 --> 01:17:24,432
Drink your papaw, Peter.

978
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:27,349
How is it?

979
01:17:28,482 --> 01:17:29,857
Bangerang.

980
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:33,604
Catch!

981
01:17:41,369 --> 01:17:42,779
Hey, Pockets...

982
01:17:43,037 --> 01:17:44,235
...catch!

983
01:17:44,955 --> 01:17:47,162
Oh, Don't Ask!

984
01:18:01,095 --> 01:18:03,004
Bangerang!

985
01:18:10,854 --> 01:18:13,060
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!

986
01:18:13,273 --> 01:18:14,388
Peter, look out!

987
01:18:14,608 --> 01:18:15,473
Peter, watch out!

988
01:18:48,139 --> 01:18:49,846
Bangerang.

989
01:19:05,780 --> 01:19:07,238
Peter...

990
01:19:07,698 --> 01:19:09,572
...can I talk to you?

991
01:19:09,825 --> 01:19:11,403
Sure, Thud.

992
01:19:12,911 --> 01:19:15,153
- I remember Tootles.
- You do?

993
01:19:15,372 --> 01:19:16,914
He was lost too.

994
01:19:17,749 --> 01:19:19,291
How could you know Tootles?

995
01:19:19,709 --> 01:19:21,785
He was a Lost Boy.

996
01:19:22,128 --> 01:19:24,334
These are his marbles.

997
01:19:26,090 --> 01:19:28,711
These are his happy thoughts.

998
01:19:36,058 --> 01:19:40,185
- He really did lose his marbles.
- Yeah, he lost them good.

999
01:19:42,564 --> 01:19:44,355
Peter, you know what?

1000
01:19:44,649 --> 01:19:47,484
My happy thought will help you.

1001
01:19:48,486 --> 01:19:50,063
What's your happy thought?

1002
01:19:51,071 --> 01:19:53,313
Mine's my mother.

1003
01:19:54,033 --> 01:19:56,819
Do you remember your mother, Peter?

1004
01:19:57,286 --> 01:19:58,744
Wish I could.

1005
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:02,741
Listen.

1006
01:20:19,139 --> 01:20:20,467
My mom sang that song.

1007
01:20:20,724 --> 01:20:24,009
My young Jack, tell me
about the game of baseball.

1008
01:20:24,269 --> 01:20:29,061
I can't remember. Are the mates
standing or are they on horseback?

1009
01:20:31,108 --> 01:20:35,984
<i>The stars are all my friends</i>

1010
01:20:36,238 --> 01:20:40,105
<i>Till the nighttime ends</i>

1011
01:20:40,325 --> 01:20:44,192
<i>So I know I'm not alone</i>

1012
01:20:44,788 --> 01:20:48,655
<i>When I'm here on my own</i>

1013
01:20:49,667 --> 01:20:53,534
<i>Isn't that a wonder</i>

1014
01:20:54,296 --> 01:20:57,582
<i>When you're alone</i>

1015
01:20:58,550 --> 01:21:02,168
<i>You're not alone</i>

1016
01:21:02,429 --> 01:21:07,553
<i>Not really alone</i>

1017
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:54,887
Good night, Never Land!

1018
01:22:33,137 --> 01:22:35,806
What is it? I hear it.
I hear it again.

1019
01:22:37,391 --> 01:22:40,060
Smee, it's that crocodile,
back from the dead!

1020
01:22:41,228 --> 01:22:45,522
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock,
tick-tock, tick-tock!

1021
01:22:45,732 --> 01:22:47,606
Is that the clock?

1022
01:22:50,111 --> 01:22:53,397
You killed that croc years ago.
We smash every clock we find.

1023
01:22:53,615 --> 01:22:55,821
Little elf didn't know any better.

1024
01:22:58,536 --> 01:23:00,244
To the museum, at once.

1025
01:23:14,175 --> 01:23:18,920
Shine 'em up! Put a fresh coat of
varnish on your peg, right here!

1026
01:23:32,317 --> 01:23:34,226
Broken clocks...

1027
01:23:34,486 --> 01:23:39,194
Each one ticked its last tock,
and now all is well.

1028
01:23:40,116 --> 01:23:41,491
Just listen.

1029
01:23:41,700 --> 01:23:43,360
I don't hear anything.

1030
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:46,989
I know! Good form! Exactly!

1031
01:23:47,206 --> 01:23:50,123
Jack, you see this? Come over here.

1032
01:23:50,333 --> 01:23:51,496
You can take it.

1033
01:23:51,710 --> 01:23:56,170
This is Barbecue's very own bedside
clock. He was quite an infamous pirate.

1034
01:23:56,381 --> 01:24:00,129
I smashed this clock
immediately after I gutted him.

1035
01:24:00,343 --> 01:24:02,300
His ship made a pretty bonfire!

1036
01:24:02,553 --> 01:24:05,470
Such a pretty, pretty...

1037
01:24:11,478 --> 01:24:14,681
What is that I hear?

1038
01:24:16,274 --> 01:24:17,768
A ticking?

1039
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:22,318
Smee, stop the ticking!

1040
01:24:23,072 --> 01:24:25,907
Stop that! Stop that "tick-tick"!

1041
01:24:26,492 --> 01:24:29,445
There's no ticking here.
There's nothing left to tick.

1042
01:24:31,204 --> 01:24:33,411
Oh, my God!

1043
01:24:33,790 --> 01:24:38,368
This is for the ticking
that might have been.

1044
01:24:39,545 --> 01:24:41,337
Get his father's watch!

1045
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,710
Go on.

1046
01:24:45,968 --> 01:24:47,711
You know you want to.

1047
01:24:47,970 --> 01:24:49,678
Give it a try.

1048
01:24:50,764 --> 01:24:51,962
Go on.

1049
01:24:52,224 --> 01:24:53,848
This is for...

1050
01:24:54,518 --> 01:24:57,269
...never letting me blow bubbles
in my chocolate milk!

1051
01:24:59,230 --> 01:25:02,930
- Good form! Bravo!
- Isn't that wonderful?

1052
01:25:03,150 --> 01:25:06,484
This is for never letting me
jump on my own bed!

1053
01:25:07,488 --> 01:25:10,442
Make time stand still, laddie.

1054
01:25:10,657 --> 01:25:14,322
For always making promises
and breaking them!

1055
01:25:14,536 --> 01:25:16,778
For never doing anything with me.

1056
01:25:18,373 --> 01:25:21,160
For a father who's never there, Jack?

1057
01:25:23,878 --> 01:25:28,041
Jack, for a father who
didn't save you on the ship.

1058
01:25:28,716 --> 01:25:30,792
Who wouldn't save us...

1059
01:25:31,009 --> 01:25:33,168
Who couldn't save you, Jack.

1060
01:25:33,637 --> 01:25:36,591
He wouldn't. He didn't even try.

1061
01:25:36,848 --> 01:25:40,762
He was there, we were there,
and he wouldn't try.

1062
01:25:43,354 --> 01:25:45,181
Jack...

1063
01:25:45,398 --> 01:25:46,643
...he will try.

1064
01:25:48,359 --> 01:25:50,600
And the question will be:

1065
01:25:50,861 --> 01:25:54,396
When the time comes,
do you want to be saved?

1066
01:25:55,824 --> 01:25:57,900
Now, don't you answer now.
No, no, no, no.

1067
01:25:58,493 --> 01:26:02,241
Now it's time to be
whatever you want to be.

1068
01:26:03,373 --> 01:26:05,828
Put behind you any thoughts of home...

1069
01:26:06,083 --> 01:26:08,870
...that place of broken promises.

1070
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,951
That what?

1071
01:26:12,339 --> 01:26:15,423
Have I ever made a promise, Jack...

1072
01:26:15,676 --> 01:26:18,925
...I have not kept?

1073
01:26:21,598 --> 01:26:23,305
Have I, son?

1074
01:26:51,542 --> 01:26:53,369
Come on. Let's go!

1075
01:27:02,719 --> 01:27:03,881
I don't like this game.

1076
01:27:04,095 --> 01:27:07,096
"Steal Hook's hook
As fast as you can."

1077
01:27:07,348 --> 01:27:09,139
"It'll make you proud."

1078
01:27:09,642 --> 01:27:12,429
"Then you crow like Pan."

1079
01:27:12,645 --> 01:27:16,891
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.
The game is about to start.

1080
01:27:23,738 --> 01:27:26,905
I need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.

1081
01:27:31,787 --> 01:27:34,360
Steal Hook's hook, then crow!

1082
01:27:54,558 --> 01:27:56,136
Jackie, boy! Jack!

1083
01:27:57,019 --> 01:28:00,269
This is for all the games
your daddy missed.

1084
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:03,267
Hook would never miss your game, son.

1085
01:28:03,483 --> 01:28:04,977
You're almost there. Take it.

1086
01:28:05,235 --> 01:28:08,650
- What's he looking at?
- Come on, you're this close!

1087
01:28:08,905 --> 01:28:10,315
What's wrong?

1088
01:28:10,531 --> 01:28:12,773
- Grab it, come on.
- Grab it, Peter!

1089
01:28:14,118 --> 01:28:15,493
Come on, Jack.

1090
01:28:16,579 --> 01:28:17,989
And one!

1091
01:28:30,425 --> 01:28:32,334
Wait for the good pitches.

1092
01:28:32,552 --> 01:28:34,378
Wait for the good pitches!

1093
01:28:41,018 --> 01:28:45,015
Jack! Jack! He's our man.
If he can't do it, no one can!

1094
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:48,018
He's stealing second!

1095
01:28:52,820 --> 01:28:54,480
No, now stop it!

1096
01:28:54,739 --> 01:28:58,570
We're playing this game according
to Master Jack's rules! Bad form!

1097
01:28:58,826 --> 01:29:01,317
Sit down now! Let's resume the game!

1098
01:29:01,537 --> 01:29:03,612
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?

1099
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:10,121
Come on, Jack!

1100
01:29:10,753 --> 01:29:13,505
Run home, Jack! Run home, Jack!

1101
01:29:21,013 --> 01:29:22,673
"Run home, Jack."

1102
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:26,839
Smee, no, no, no!
They've got it backwards!

1103
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:28,720
Tell them to turn it around!

1104
01:29:28,979 --> 01:29:30,223
Maggie?

1105
01:29:30,980 --> 01:29:32,439
Switch!

1106
01:29:37,403 --> 01:29:41,103
Home run, Jack! Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack!

1107
01:29:41,824 --> 01:29:44,361
Home run, Jack. Home run, Jack.

1108
01:29:52,625 --> 01:29:54,534
He can't hit the curve.

1109
01:30:20,067 --> 01:30:22,024
My Jack!

1110
01:30:24,238 --> 01:30:25,352
My Jack.

1111
01:30:34,664 --> 01:30:37,700
You did it! Hoist him up!

1112
01:30:41,962 --> 01:30:45,413
That's my boy! You did it, son!

1113
01:31:23,209 --> 01:31:24,240
Gotta fly!

1114
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:26,407
Happy thought.

1115
01:31:26,670 --> 01:31:30,881
Happy thought, happy thought,
happy thought, happy...

1116
01:31:31,174 --> 01:31:33,582
One great, big happy thought!

1117
01:31:34,010 --> 01:31:35,469
Less is more.

1118
01:31:37,931 --> 01:31:39,211
I can!

1119
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:14,508
"Tootles. Wendy. John.

1120
01:33:14,770 --> 01:33:17,343
Michael. Peter."

1121
01:33:39,918 --> 01:33:43,915
Be careful, Peter. You're
a lot taller than you used to be.

1122
01:33:45,131 --> 01:33:46,839
Well, say something.

1123
01:33:49,218 --> 01:33:51,009
Do you like my dress?

1124
01:33:55,849 --> 01:33:57,592
You look beautiful.

1125
01:34:03,064 --> 01:34:04,973
What's the occasion?

1126
01:34:05,483 --> 01:34:06,646
You are.

1127
01:34:07,693 --> 01:34:09,567
It's a welcome-home party.

1128
01:34:15,492 --> 01:34:16,867
What happened here?

1129
01:34:17,077 --> 01:34:18,357
Hook.

1130
01:34:18,578 --> 01:34:20,452
Burnt it when you didn't come back.

1131
01:34:41,349 --> 01:34:42,725
Kiss.

1132
01:34:48,231 --> 01:34:49,606
Wendy.

1133
01:34:52,943 --> 01:34:54,603
This is Wendy's house.

1134
01:34:54,862 --> 01:34:56,901
Tootles and Nibs built it for her.

1135
01:34:59,908 --> 01:35:01,533
I remember.

1136
01:35:03,620 --> 01:35:05,328
Wendy would sit in that chair.

1137
01:35:06,789 --> 01:35:09,197
But it wasn't there. It was here.

1138
01:35:10,334 --> 01:35:13,952
We used to sit here while
she'd darn socks and tell us stories.

1139
01:35:15,214 --> 01:35:16,922
She slept here.

1140
01:35:17,633 --> 01:35:19,590
Tink, your apartment was right here.

1141
01:35:19,801 --> 01:35:21,046
Yes.

1142
01:35:21,678 --> 01:35:25,676
Little Michael in his basket bed,
right here.

1143
01:35:26,599 --> 01:35:27,844
John.

1144
01:35:35,983 --> 01:35:39,149
Teddy. My Teddy.

1145
01:35:44,199 --> 01:35:47,365
Mother used to put him in the pram
to keep me company.

1146
01:35:52,999 --> 01:35:54,991
I remember my mother.

1147
01:35:56,210 --> 01:35:58,001
I remember her.

1148
01:36:00,297 --> 01:36:03,582
You can be sure,
very fine schools indeed.

1149
01:36:04,217 --> 01:36:08,001
First, he will attend Whitehall,
then Oxford.

1150
01:36:08,263 --> 01:36:09,176
And of course...

1151
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:14,383
...after graduation, he will prepare
for a judgeship in the highest court...

1152
01:36:14,644 --> 01:36:19,186
...making time for marriage
and family and all of that.

1153
01:36:19,398 --> 01:36:20,726
Just like his father.

1154
01:36:20,983 --> 01:36:23,521
<i>Isn't that what grownups</i>
<i>want for their children?</i>

1155
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:25,816
<i>I was afraid.</i>
<i>I didn't wanna grow up.</i>

1156
01:36:26,029 --> 01:36:29,065
<i>Everybody who grows up</i>
<i>has to die someday.</i>

1157
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:31,157
<i>So I ran away.</i>

1158
01:36:41,835 --> 01:36:43,080
<i>Tink...</i>

1159
01:36:44,379 --> 01:36:46,586
<i>... you came and you saved me.</i>

1160
01:36:47,257 --> 01:36:51,171
<i>You brought me to Never Land.</i>
<i>You taught me to fly.</i>

1161
01:36:53,971 --> 01:36:58,265
<i>But I was still a little boy,</i>
<i>and I missed my mother.</i>

1162
01:36:58,684 --> 01:37:02,017
<i>So I decided to fly home</i>
<i>to my very own window.</i>

1163
01:37:02,980 --> 01:37:03,845
<i>But it was shut.</i>

1164
01:37:05,315 --> 01:37:06,690
<i>They'd forgotten about me.</i>

1165
01:37:11,279 --> 01:37:16,190
<i>I found other windows to visit,</i>
<i>ones that weren't shut closed on me.</i>

1166
01:37:16,784 --> 01:37:20,319
<i>That's how I met Wendy.</i>
<i>I chased my shadow in her nursery.</i>

1167
01:37:20,538 --> 01:37:24,950
<i>I expected my shadow and I would</i>
<i>join together like drops of water.</i>

1168
01:37:35,468 --> 01:37:37,046
Boy!

1169
01:37:39,764 --> 01:37:41,555
Why are you crying?

1170
01:37:43,892 --> 01:37:45,517
What's your name?

1171
01:37:46,687 --> 01:37:50,387
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?

1172
01:37:50,774 --> 01:37:54,985
<i>I came back many times for Wendy.</i>
<i>Always in the spring.</i>

1173
01:37:57,780 --> 01:37:59,986
<i>And Wendy kept getting older...</i>

1174
01:38:00,658 --> 01:38:01,689
<i>... and older.</i>

1175
01:38:01,951 --> 01:38:05,818
<i>And then I came back the last time.</i>

1176
01:38:06,121 --> 01:38:11,246
Peter, I can't come with you.
I've forgotten how to fly.

1177
01:38:12,377 --> 01:38:14,583
I'm old, Peter.

1178
01:38:15,505 --> 01:38:17,912
Ever so much more than 20.

1179
01:38:18,800 --> 01:38:21,373
- I grew up a long time ago.
- No, no, no!

1180
01:38:21,594 --> 01:38:23,800
- You promised!
- I have children of my own now.

1181
01:38:24,054 --> 01:38:26,545
They have children of their own.

1182
01:38:26,765 --> 01:38:31,308
That's my grandchild, Moira,
asleep in the bed.

1183
01:38:31,561 --> 01:38:33,637
<i>When I saw her lying there sleeping...</i>

1184
01:38:33,855 --> 01:38:36,891
<i>... at that moment,</i>
<i>something changed in me forever.</i>

1185
01:38:37,108 --> 01:38:39,184
I shall give her a kiss.

1186
01:38:40,528 --> 01:38:43,778
No! No, Peter!
No buttons, no thimbles.

1187
01:38:44,031 --> 01:38:48,360
I couldn't bear her heart to be broken
when she finds she can't keep you.

1188
01:38:50,871 --> 01:38:51,902
No.

1189
01:38:53,623 --> 01:38:56,577
I mean a real kiss.

1190
01:39:20,523 --> 01:39:23,607
I can see why you have trouble
finding a happy thought.

1191
01:39:25,069 --> 01:39:27,773
So many sad memories, Peter.

1192
01:39:29,406 --> 01:39:31,114
Bye, Teddy.

1193
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:36,445
Not Teddy. Daddy!

1194
01:39:37,247 --> 01:39:38,409
Daddy!

1195
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:44,250
Peter, you're a daddy.

1196
01:39:48,215 --> 01:39:49,045
Hi, Jack.

1197
01:39:49,258 --> 01:39:52,591
<i>I know why I came back.</i>
<i>I know why I grew up.</i>

1198
01:39:53,387 --> 01:39:56,340
<i>I wanted to be a father.</i>

1199
01:39:56,806 --> 01:39:58,431
I'm a daddy.

1200
01:40:00,810 --> 01:40:02,518
My happy thought.

1201
01:40:03,438 --> 01:40:04,682
I got it!

1202
01:40:04,897 --> 01:40:07,388
I got it! I found it!

1203
01:40:09,818 --> 01:40:10,648
I lost it!

1204
01:40:12,404 --> 01:40:15,109
Just hold that happy thought, Peter!

1205
01:40:42,390 --> 01:40:44,050
Peter Pan!

1206
01:41:11,292 --> 01:41:13,201
He's back! He's back!

1207
01:41:13,419 --> 01:41:14,961
He's back!

1208
01:42:09,387 --> 01:42:10,466
Play!

1209
01:42:10,721 --> 01:42:12,299
Play!

1210
01:42:40,290 --> 01:42:41,915
You are the Pan.

1211
01:43:02,644 --> 01:43:06,724
You can fly, you can fight,
and you can...

1212
01:43:54,067 --> 01:43:55,477
Tink, you in there?

1213
01:43:59,238 --> 01:44:00,401
Are you sad?

1214
01:44:00,656 --> 01:44:02,695
No, I'm neither. Please go away.

1215
01:44:02,908 --> 01:44:04,236
Oh, you're sick.

1216
01:44:04,785 --> 01:44:06,611
You need a Band-Aid.
Or a thermometer!

1217
01:44:06,828 --> 01:44:09,402
That's how Nibs made
the Wendy lady better.

1218
01:44:09,623 --> 01:44:12,160
Oh, no, Peter! It's not about that!

1219
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:13,240
Yes, it is!

1220
01:44:13,459 --> 01:44:16,129
Nibs put the thermometer in her mouth.

1221
01:44:17,213 --> 01:44:18,624
Felt all better.

1222
01:44:21,133 --> 01:44:22,960
Don't we have
the greatest adventures?

1223
01:44:24,845 --> 01:44:28,214
Do you remember your next
great adventure to save your kids?

1224
01:44:29,015 --> 01:44:30,509
Kids?

1225
01:44:32,018 --> 01:44:33,761
Peter Pan's got kids?

1226
01:44:35,063 --> 01:44:36,438
Why are you in Never Land?

1227
01:44:36,647 --> 01:44:38,723
To always be a little boy and have fun.

1228
01:44:38,941 --> 01:44:41,776
I like this game. Ask me another one.

1229
01:44:56,249 --> 01:44:57,957
Oh, dear me! I did it.

1230
01:44:58,209 --> 01:45:01,993
Tink, look what happened!
You broke your house.

1231
01:45:04,923 --> 01:45:06,501
You're humongous.

1232
01:45:08,719 --> 01:45:11,589
This is the only wish
I ever wished for myself.

1233
01:45:13,056 --> 01:45:15,807
This is the biggest
feeling I've ever, ever felt.

1234
01:45:16,059 --> 01:45:20,969
And this is the first time
I've been big enough to have it.

1235
01:45:21,856 --> 01:45:25,355
Peter, I wanna give you a kiss.

1236
01:45:28,987 --> 01:45:31,193
No, I mean a real kiss.

1237
01:45:36,911 --> 01:45:38,904
I love you, Peter Pan.

1238
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:41,489
I love...

1239
01:45:41,707 --> 01:45:42,537
...her.

1240
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:44,327
"Her," who?

1241
01:45:45,252 --> 01:45:46,830
Mo...

1242
01:45:47,087 --> 01:45:48,036
Moira!

1243
01:45:48,464 --> 01:45:50,373
I love Moira...

1244
01:45:51,383 --> 01:45:53,838
...and Jack and Maggie.

1245
01:45:57,514 --> 01:45:58,924
Jack and Maggie...

1246
01:46:04,645 --> 01:46:06,684
I have a plan. Tink?

1247
01:46:07,982 --> 01:46:09,144
Come on. You gotta come.

1248
01:46:10,817 --> 01:46:13,937
When it's all over, you'll leave
and never come back again.

1249
01:46:19,576 --> 01:46:21,485
What are you staring at, Peter?

1250
01:46:22,745 --> 01:46:24,156
Save them.

1251
01:46:24,789 --> 01:46:26,247
Go save them.

1252
01:46:29,460 --> 01:46:30,705
You silly ass, go!

1253
01:47:11,999 --> 01:47:16,292
Jack, it's a very special time when
a pirate receives his first earring.

1254
01:47:16,503 --> 01:47:21,627
It's like the first time you
run someone through with your blade.

1255
01:47:24,302 --> 01:47:25,132
Now, Jack...

1256
01:47:25,344 --> 01:47:28,927
...I'm gonna ask you to bend
your head ever so slightly.

1257
01:47:29,181 --> 01:47:31,506
A little more. That's it.

1258
01:47:31,767 --> 01:47:35,599
And brace yourself, lad.
Because this...

1259
01:47:35,854 --> 01:47:38,261
...is really going to hurt.

1260
01:47:47,240 --> 01:47:49,446
Smee, what is that?

1261
01:48:00,460 --> 01:48:02,369
Who is that, captain?

1262
01:48:06,340 --> 01:48:08,167
It's Peter Pan.

1263
01:48:08,509 --> 01:48:10,965
Has it been three days?

1264
01:48:11,554 --> 01:48:13,012
'Tis true, Peter...

1265
01:48:13,264 --> 01:48:15,719
...time does fly.

1266
01:48:17,476 --> 01:48:20,049
And so do you, I see.

1267
01:48:20,478 --> 01:48:25,306
How did you ever manage to fit
into those smashing tights again, Peter?

1268
01:48:29,028 --> 01:48:31,815
Hand over my son now
and you and your men may go free.

1269
01:48:32,156 --> 01:48:37,280
Why don't you ask the lad yourself?
Jack, someone to see you, son.

1270
01:48:41,039 --> 01:48:43,874
Jack, give me your hand.
We're going home.

1271
01:48:44,167 --> 01:48:45,709
I am home.

1272
01:48:46,878 --> 01:48:48,206
Good form!

1273
01:48:48,713 --> 01:48:52,662
You see, Peter, he is my son.
He loves me dearly.

1274
01:48:52,925 --> 01:48:56,045
And I'm prepared to fight
dearly for him.

1275
01:48:56,261 --> 01:48:59,713
I've waited long to shake your hand
with this.

1276
01:48:59,973 --> 01:49:02,642
Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom!

1277
01:49:03,643 --> 01:49:05,766
Dark and sinister man, have at thee.

1278
01:49:37,132 --> 01:49:41,759
Don't you love it, laddie? Once you've
shed blood, it's hard to stop!

1279
01:49:42,012 --> 01:49:44,337
It's a pirate's life, my lad!

1280
01:49:44,598 --> 01:49:46,424
Jack, Jack!

1281
01:49:46,808 --> 01:49:50,141
- Don't I know him?
- No, you've never seen him before!

1282
01:49:51,938 --> 01:49:54,938
You won't believe this,
but I found my happy thought.

1283
01:49:55,149 --> 01:49:58,233
It took me three days,
then guess what happened?

1284
01:49:58,444 --> 01:50:00,068
Up I went!

1285
01:50:00,279 --> 01:50:02,485
You know what my happy thought was?

1286
01:50:06,910 --> 01:50:08,534
It was you.

1287
01:50:18,420 --> 01:50:22,003
That's my dad... but he hates to fly!

1288
01:50:22,216 --> 01:50:24,291
Bangerang!

1289
01:51:04,004 --> 01:51:06,791
Call out the militia!
We'll need every last man!

1290
01:51:15,473 --> 01:51:20,384
If there's anybody not fighting,
get here quick!

1291
01:51:29,319 --> 01:51:31,311
Form ranks!

1292
01:51:31,613 --> 01:51:34,649
Form ranks!

1293
01:51:35,533 --> 01:51:38,154
Show them
the white light we're made of!

1294
01:51:38,369 --> 01:51:41,489
Remember the fires from hell
that forged you!

1295
01:51:41,705 --> 01:51:43,698
Charge!

1296
01:51:45,584 --> 01:51:47,161
Now!

1297
01:51:51,589 --> 01:51:54,875
We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!

1298
01:52:18,114 --> 01:52:20,735
Smee! Do something intelligent!

1299
01:52:23,119 --> 01:52:25,953
"Smee, Smee"! What about Smee?

1300
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:30,118
What about Smee?

1301
01:52:31,126 --> 01:52:32,205
What about me?

1302
01:52:40,218 --> 01:52:41,676
Thud ball!

1303
01:52:53,772 --> 01:52:55,017
Fire!

1304
01:53:06,200 --> 01:53:08,691
Hey, wait!

1305
01:53:09,578 --> 01:53:10,693
Look out below!

1306
01:53:17,669 --> 01:53:20,872
Somebody help!

1307
01:53:31,265 --> 01:53:33,506
Here we go. Take it, take it, take it!

1308
01:53:34,226 --> 01:53:36,432
Lost Boys, down!

1309
01:53:42,942 --> 01:53:44,650
My eyes!

1310
01:53:44,986 --> 01:53:48,319
It's time for Smee.

1311
01:53:58,039 --> 01:54:01,159
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that window!

1312
01:54:11,885 --> 01:54:13,048
Hook!

1313
01:54:16,890 --> 01:54:19,428
Rufio.

1314
01:54:23,021 --> 01:54:24,812
The old man is mine.

1315
01:54:25,231 --> 01:54:28,765
Jack! Save me!

1316
01:54:28,984 --> 01:54:30,526
Maggie!

1317
01:54:41,204 --> 01:54:42,947
Get down here!

1318
01:54:43,831 --> 01:54:45,242
Maggie!

1319
01:54:45,458 --> 01:54:47,035
Daddy!

1320
01:54:49,086 --> 01:54:50,497
Wait, ain't you...

1321
01:54:50,754 --> 01:54:52,130
Peter Pan.

1322
01:55:02,599 --> 01:55:03,927
Daddy!

1323
01:55:04,183 --> 01:55:05,891
Daddy?

1324
01:55:08,479 --> 01:55:12,559
Peter Pan's my dad?

1325
01:55:31,959 --> 01:55:34,035
I'll never lose you again.

1326
01:55:36,922 --> 01:55:39,876
Lost Boys, we got them on the run!

1327
01:56:15,374 --> 01:56:17,165
Here comes Pan!

1328
01:56:21,630 --> 01:56:23,254
Looky, looky, I got Hooky.

1329
01:56:26,050 --> 01:56:27,794
Hook! No!

1330
01:56:35,726 --> 01:56:37,434
Do you know what I wish?

1331
01:56:37,686 --> 01:56:38,717
What?

1332
01:56:41,064 --> 01:56:43,306
I wish I had a dad...

1333
01:56:44,025 --> 01:56:45,567
...like you.

1334
01:56:50,031 --> 01:56:52,237
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.

1335
01:57:03,377 --> 01:57:05,998
Are you ready for me, Peter?

1336
01:57:06,713 --> 01:57:09,749
Come on. Humor the Hook.

1337
01:57:10,258 --> 01:57:11,254
Dad.

1338
01:57:18,474 --> 01:57:19,636
I wanna go home.

1339
01:57:19,850 --> 01:57:22,423
What are you talking about?
You are home.

1340
01:57:35,656 --> 01:57:36,985
Where are you going?

1341
01:57:51,337 --> 01:57:52,535
Lost Boys!

1342
01:57:55,508 --> 01:57:56,338
Peter!

1343
01:57:57,051 --> 01:58:00,170
Where are you going?
Come back here and fight me!

1344
01:58:00,387 --> 01:58:02,427
I'll find you wherever you are!

1345
01:58:02,681 --> 01:58:04,757
Bad form, Peter! Come back.

1346
01:58:04,975 --> 01:58:08,557
You need a mother very, very badly!

1347
01:58:11,481 --> 01:58:13,557
Smee! Follow me!

1348
01:58:13,858 --> 01:58:16,978
- Stairs!
- Just moving your personal...

1349
01:58:19,071 --> 01:58:21,527
Wherever you go, wherever you are...

1350
01:58:21,782 --> 01:58:26,111
...I vow there will always be daggers
bearing notes signed "James Hook."

1351
01:58:26,370 --> 01:58:30,912
They will be flung at the doors of
your children's children's children.

1352
01:58:31,166 --> 01:58:32,957
Do you hear me?

1353
01:58:43,052 --> 01:58:44,629
What do you want, old man?

1354
01:58:49,099 --> 01:58:50,213
Just you.

1355
01:58:50,433 --> 01:58:52,556
You've got me, James Hook.

1356
01:58:56,397 --> 01:58:58,805
Pan "The Avenger" is back.

1357
01:58:59,025 --> 01:59:02,939
And the Hook is waiting, Peter Pan.

1358
01:59:13,288 --> 01:59:14,746
It's Hook and me this time.

1359
01:59:14,998 --> 01:59:17,749
- Prepare to die.
- To die would be a great adventure.

1360
01:59:17,959 --> 01:59:20,710
Death is the only adventure
you have left.

1361
01:59:31,972 --> 01:59:33,845
I remember you being a lot bigger.

1362
01:59:34,057 --> 01:59:35,800
To a 10-year-old, I'm huge.

1363
01:59:51,031 --> 01:59:52,739
No pain, no gain, James!

1364
02:00:07,629 --> 02:00:09,503
Good form, old man.

1365
02:00:13,552 --> 02:00:17,252
You know you're not really Peter Pan.
This is only a dream.

1366
02:00:17,514 --> 02:00:21,843
You'll wake up, you'll be Peter Banning,
a selfish man who drinks too much...

1367
02:00:22,101 --> 02:00:26,810
...who's obsessed with success and runs
and hides from his wife and children.

1368
02:00:28,774 --> 02:00:30,601
I believe in you.

1369
02:00:30,817 --> 02:00:33,569
- I believe in you.
- I believe in you, Peter.

1370
02:00:35,030 --> 02:00:37,069
I believe in you.

1371
02:00:38,992 --> 02:00:40,486
You are the Pan.

1372
02:00:40,743 --> 02:00:42,570
You're Peter Pan.

1373
02:00:44,872 --> 02:00:45,868
I believe in you...

1374
02:00:47,041 --> 02:00:48,499
...Peter Pan.

1375
02:01:08,519 --> 02:01:09,977
- Bad form!
- Jack, stop!

1376
02:01:11,271 --> 02:01:13,311
Now we end this.

1377
02:01:22,448 --> 02:01:25,153
You blackguard!

1378
02:01:35,294 --> 02:01:37,001
Hello! Tick-tock, tick-tock...

1379
02:01:37,212 --> 02:01:39,785
...Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock!

1380
02:01:40,006 --> 02:01:44,383
I think not! I think James Hook's
afraid of time, ticking away!

1381
02:01:53,227 --> 02:01:54,258
Tick...

1382
02:02:05,321 --> 02:02:09,188
Good form, Peter. I am fallen.

1383
02:02:12,494 --> 02:02:17,322
Give me my dignity. You took my hand.
You owe me something.

1384
02:02:29,927 --> 02:02:34,505
You killed Rufio. You kidnapped
my children. You deserve to die.

1385
02:02:34,723 --> 02:02:39,017
Strike, Peter Pan. Strike true.

1386
02:02:39,644 --> 02:02:44,306
Daddy, let's go home. Please?

1387
02:02:44,524 --> 02:02:47,441
He's just a mean old man
without a mommy.

1388
02:02:48,277 --> 02:02:52,144
Yeah, Dad, let's go.
He can't hurt us anymore.

1389
02:02:52,948 --> 02:02:55,902
Bless you, child. Good form, Jack.

1390
02:02:56,118 --> 02:03:00,281
After all, what would
the world be like...

1391
02:03:01,498 --> 02:03:03,206
...without Captain Hook?

1392
02:03:04,542 --> 02:03:07,993
I want you to take your ship and go.

1393
02:03:08,337 --> 02:03:11,255
I never want to see your face
in Never Land again.

1394
02:03:18,847 --> 02:03:22,097
- Peter, look out!
- Fools, James Hook is Never Land!

1395
02:03:23,935 --> 02:03:26,770
Whenever children read, it will say:

1396
02:03:26,980 --> 02:03:30,313
"Thus perished Peter Pan."

1397
02:03:41,243 --> 02:03:43,282
What's happening?

1398
02:04:07,725 --> 02:04:11,094
I want my Mommy!

1399
02:04:31,914 --> 02:04:33,907
Hook's gone.

1400
02:04:34,333 --> 02:04:37,038
Hook's gone! Hook's gone!

1401
02:04:40,339 --> 02:04:42,415
Bangerang!

1402
02:04:45,802 --> 02:04:46,632
No more Hook!

1403
02:04:46,887 --> 02:04:50,089
No more Hook! No more Hook!

1404
02:04:53,559 --> 02:04:55,801
Hurray for Pan the Man!

1405
02:05:03,527 --> 02:05:05,603
What's wrong, Peter?

1406
02:05:05,987 --> 02:05:10,982
I can't stay. I've done what I came
to do, and now I have to go back.

1407
02:05:14,787 --> 02:05:17,907
Tink, make my kids glow.

1408
02:05:27,090 --> 02:05:31,799
Jack, Maggie, all you have
to do is think one happy thought...

1409
02:05:32,053 --> 02:05:33,761
...and you'll fly like me.

1410
02:05:37,892 --> 02:05:39,090
Mommy!

1411
02:05:40,436 --> 02:05:41,894
My dad...

1412
02:05:43,022 --> 02:05:44,599
...Peter Pan.

1413
02:05:48,777 --> 02:05:50,853
Tink, you know the way.

1414
02:05:51,154 --> 02:05:52,945
I'll be just behind you.

1415
02:06:15,134 --> 02:06:18,799
Don't leave us, Peter,
and don't say goodbye.

1416
02:06:19,096 --> 02:06:20,507
What's "goodbye"?

1417
02:06:20,765 --> 02:06:23,386
It's going away. That's what it is.

1418
02:06:23,642 --> 02:06:25,551
Forgetting about us all over again.

1419
02:06:25,769 --> 02:06:28,604
You're all my Lost Boys.
I'll never forget you.

1420
02:06:29,314 --> 02:06:30,559
Never.

1421
02:06:33,902 --> 02:06:35,894
So who do I leave in charge?

1422
02:07:11,853 --> 02:07:15,304
I want you to take care of everyone
who's smaller than you.

1423
02:07:16,441 --> 02:07:18,599
Then who do I look after?

1424
02:07:19,569 --> 02:07:21,146
Never Bugs.

1425
02:07:22,446 --> 02:07:24,071
Little ones.

1426
02:07:46,469 --> 02:07:49,754
That was a great game.

1427
02:07:50,431 --> 02:07:52,423
<i>Thank you for believing.</i>

1428
02:08:28,048 --> 02:08:29,507
I know her.

1429
02:08:30,551 --> 02:08:33,172
She looks like an angel.

1430
02:08:33,387 --> 02:08:35,794
Let's not wake her yet.

1431
02:09:24,434 --> 02:09:28,134
My dear child,
have you been up all night?

1432
02:09:29,272 --> 02:09:32,723
I see them in their beds
so often in my dreams.

1433
02:09:33,317 --> 02:09:35,523
When I wake up, they're still there.

1434
02:10:18,692 --> 02:10:22,143
Tink? Tink? Tink?

1435
02:10:31,370 --> 02:10:32,200
Hello.

1436
02:10:35,374 --> 02:10:39,502
Having trouble with the misses?
You will have, by the time you get home.

1437
02:10:45,800 --> 02:10:46,630
Tink!

1438
02:10:48,636 --> 02:10:52,171
Say it, Peter. Say it and mean it.

1439
02:10:53,724 --> 02:10:55,515
I believe in faeries.

1440
02:10:56,018 --> 02:10:58,853
Do you know that place
between sleep and awake...

1441
02:10:59,354 --> 02:11:01,311
...where you still remember dreaming?

1442
02:11:03,733 --> 02:11:05,940
That's where I'll always love you...

1443
02:11:06,945 --> 02:11:08,605
...Peter Pan.

1444
02:11:11,449 --> 02:11:13,240
That's where I'll be waiting.

1445
02:11:33,302 --> 02:11:34,796
Nana!

1446
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:38,262
Oh, give us a kiss!
Come here, you drool machine!

1447
02:11:46,022 --> 02:11:47,433
Tink?

1448
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:08,617
Brad! Hi! Have you been
holding this long?

1449
02:12:09,627 --> 02:12:12,913
I'm incredible! Yeah. Never Land!

1450
02:12:14,215 --> 02:12:18,627
Lost Boys. Jim Hook. Duel to
the death. I'll fill you in later.

1451
02:12:18,886 --> 02:12:20,629
Listen, I'd love to chat...

1452
02:12:20,888 --> 02:12:23,094
...but I gotta climb
a drainpipe now.

1453
02:12:23,724 --> 02:12:28,718
Why? Because I ran out of faerie dust.
If not, I would've flown up. Why!!

1454
02:12:35,068 --> 02:12:38,152
- There were pirates..!
- And monsters there!

1455
02:12:38,904 --> 02:12:40,280
Just like you said!

1456
02:12:40,489 --> 02:12:41,864
Granny Wendy!

1457
02:12:42,992 --> 02:12:43,940
Let me in!

1458
02:12:44,660 --> 02:12:46,035
Please.

1459
02:12:48,622 --> 02:12:50,994
Excuse me, do you have an appointment?

1460
02:12:53,626 --> 02:12:56,662
What did I tell you about this window?

1461
02:12:56,963 --> 02:12:58,338
Always keep it open!

1462
02:13:00,174 --> 02:13:03,128
Never, ever, ever close...

1463
02:13:22,695 --> 02:13:24,189
I have to take this.

1464
02:13:24,405 --> 02:13:28,698
Have you ever known what it's like to
feel the exhilaration of really flying?

1465
02:13:28,950 --> 02:13:30,658
Feel this.

1466
02:13:31,661 --> 02:13:33,155
Where have you been?

1467
02:13:33,371 --> 02:13:34,616
Fly me, Daddy, fly me!

1468
02:13:34,831 --> 02:13:38,365
Anytime, Maggie.
To infinity and back again.

1469
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,668
Hello, Peter.

1470
02:13:41,337 --> 02:13:44,622
I missed the adventure again, didn't I?

1471
02:13:46,300 --> 02:13:48,376
I think these belong to you.

1472
02:14:00,855 --> 02:14:01,685
Look!

1473
02:14:02,106 --> 02:14:05,309
See, look! I didn't lose
my marbles after all!

1474
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:07,026
Wendy, look! See?

1475
02:14:07,236 --> 02:14:09,857
I didn't lose my marbles after all!

1476
02:14:11,698 --> 02:14:13,489
Hello, boy.

1477
02:14:14,534 --> 02:14:16,325
Hello, Wendy lady.

1478
02:14:17,036 --> 02:14:18,199
Give us a skwoodge.

1479
02:14:29,339 --> 02:14:31,166
Boy, why are you crying?

1480
02:14:31,717 --> 02:14:34,883
I don't know.
A tear for every happy thought.

1481
02:14:35,178 --> 02:14:36,008
One for me?

1482
02:14:36,930 --> 02:14:38,638
- One for me?
- One for me?

1483
02:14:38,890 --> 02:14:41,048
And one for me!

1484
02:14:55,780 --> 02:14:57,737
Seize the day!

1485
02:15:01,202 --> 02:15:04,322
So your adventures are over.

1486
02:15:04,580 --> 02:15:05,991
Oh, no.

1487
02:15:06,248 --> 02:15:07,742
To live...

1488
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:10,751
To live would be
an awfully big adventure.
