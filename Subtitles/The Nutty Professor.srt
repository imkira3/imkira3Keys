Oh, well, well.
l'm glad you're taking it
like that, sir.

1110
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,235
l thought
you was gonna get angry
and start screaming

1111
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:35,228
and hollering,
and maybe even fire me.

1112
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,975
(LAUGHING) Whoo!
Oh, Sherman, Sherman.

1113
00:54:38,976 --> 00:54:41,110
ln the end we know
so little of each other, hmm?

1114
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:44,981
No, my friend, l've got
bigger fish to fry.
l spoke to Harlan Hartley.

1115
00:54:44,982 --> 00:54:48,351
He's offering that tiny
trinket that could save
your entire research program.

1116
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:49,652
Oh, yes. Absolutely.

1117
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:50,820
l set up a meeting with him.

1118
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:53,789
He wants to hear your
grant proposal personally.

1119

Friday, the Ritz,
dinner, 8:00 sharp.

1120
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:59,462
Well, sir, l think
that's a wonderful idea,
sir. Absolutely.

1121
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:01,864
And l promise you,
l will not let you down.

1122
00:55:01,865 --> 00:55:03,432
l know you won't.

1123
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,701
l know
you're going to be there
and you're going to be great.

1124
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:07,303
ln fact, l know
you're going to be perfect.

Do you know how l know?

1127
00:55:10,007 --> 00:55:11,107
How's that?

1128

for any reason,
l'm going to kill you.

1131
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:23,753
l don't mean that
as a euphemism. l'm going
to literally kill you.

1132
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:28,424
l'm going to strangle you
and choke off your air supply

1133

until you pass away.

1134

(EXCLAIMS) Okay.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

1138
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,045
Sir, this is incredible.

1139
00:55:49,046 --> 00:55:51,314
lt's... lt's a complete
metabolic transformation.

1140
00:55:51,315 --> 00:55:53,749
How did it happen?
Was it an accident?

1141
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,519
No, l did it
to myself, Jason.

1142
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,721
You did? Why?

1143
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:03,125
lf it was for the grant,
the data with Shelley was
already so compelling.

1144
00:56:03,126 --> 00:56:06,495
Well, l have compelling
reasons of my own, Jason.

1145
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:09,599
l have a case of infatuation
of sorts with Miss Purty.

1146
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:13,936
Professor, if you feel
this way about Carla,
why don't you tell her?

1147
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,905
lt'd be a lot simpler
than transforming into...

1148
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:18,941
This guy's testosterone levels
are right off the charts.

1149
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:22,211
He was mean last night.
lt was so unlike you.

1150
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,479
You know, l did feel that.

1151
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,448
Sir, you can't control him.

1152
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:28,918
Jason, you have no idea
what it feels like
to be Buddy Love.

1153
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:31,887
lt's indescribable.
lt's just wonderful!

1154
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:35,391
The way people talk to him
and treat him, and the way
she looks at him.

1155
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:38,027
But he's dangerous.
He almost killed us
last night.

1156
00:56:38,028 --> 00:56:41,998
We should be concentrating
on getting the grant proposal
to Harlan Hartley.

1157
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:43,489
This is nuts!

1158
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:50,200
l guess you're right, Jason.
l never have behaved
like this before.

1159
00:56:52,376 --> 00:56:54,936
But on the other hand,

1160
00:56:55,913 --> 00:56:58,981
l've never been
in love before.

1161

Afternoon, Carla.

1163

Hi, Sherman.

1164
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:24,040
How are you doing today?

1165
00:57:24,041 --> 00:57:25,341
Pretty good.

1166
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:28,511
l come over to see
how things were going
with you and Buddy.

1167
00:57:28,512 --> 00:57:30,513
l wish l knew.

1168
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:34,116
We went out last night.
lt was great. We had
such a wonderful time.

1169
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,585
And then all of a sudden
he runs out of the club.

1170
00:57:36,586 --> 00:57:38,354
He has some allergic reaction.

1171
00:57:38,355 --> 00:57:39,956
l don't even know
if he's all right.

1172
00:57:39,957 --> 00:57:41,057
He's fine.

1173
00:57:41,058 --> 00:57:43,059
He told me
that his lip swelled up,

1174
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,760
he put ice on it
and the swelling came down.

1175
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:45,928
Kinda strange, huh?

1176
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,431
Well, did he even ask
about me?

1177
00:57:48,432 --> 00:57:51,901
Did he say why he didn't
call me and let me know
he was all right?

1178
00:57:51,902 --> 00:57:53,569
Carla, Buddy's kind of
unreliable.

1179
00:57:53,570 --> 00:57:55,071
He's kind of
what you call

1180
00:57:55,072 --> 00:57:57,540
a "here today,
gone tomorrow"
kind of fellow.

1181
00:57:57,541 --> 00:57:59,308
Oh, l see.
Mmm-hmm.

1182
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:03,412
So he had you talk to me
because he's not interested
anymore.

1183
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:05,514
No, it's nothing
quite like that.
Look.

1184
00:58:05,515 --> 00:58:09,185
l know what it feels like
to be brushed off,
and it's okay.

1185
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:11,053
This is all my fault.

1186
00:58:11,054 --> 00:58:13,723
l should've never
encouraged you
to go out with Buddy.

1187
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:16,090
Sherman, you have been
so sweet.

1188
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:20,252
l'll just have to
forget about him.
l'll see you later.

1189

Carla.

1190
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,502
l was wondering if

1191
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:29,472
l could talk to you
about you and l,
for a second.

1192
00:58:29,473 --> 00:58:31,407
l was...

1193
00:58:33,076 --> 00:58:35,277
l was wondering
what you were doing later,

1194
00:58:35,278 --> 00:58:38,280
'cause the family
gonna get together.

1195
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:41,050
She made a meal

1196
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:43,219
and we gonna be eating,
so l figured

for dinner,

1201
00:58:54,598 --> 00:58:55,765
Would you, now?

1202
00:58:55,766 --> 00:58:57,099
Yes, l would.

1203
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,002
Should we call
and make sure there's
going to be enough food?

1204
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,495
l don't think
that's going to be a problem.

is let us talk to her.

bring me flowers and candy,

Shame on you, Sherman!

Do you know
what you did last night?
You had the time of your life.

you can get arrested

You know what you need to do?

1579
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:24,753
You need to go down
to the laboratory

and mix up another batch
of this blue stuff.

Come on back to the party,
Sherman, because Carla
doesn't want you.

She wants me. Me, not you.

because you can't beat me.

will be coming tonight.

Yes, he is.

make sure we was here.

He got a big announcement
to make.

all off his chest.

that Sherman's been acting
kind of strange lately?

Sherman has definitely
been acting strange lately.

l knew it!
See, Cletus? l told you.

l be listening to you.
l ain't listening to you!

between her and Sherman.

You don't go get up
in Sherman's business.
That's Sherman's business.

Sherman's business?
That's my business.

it's not gonna come
from some magic drink.

lf l drink 500 milliliters
of formula,

l'll have enough
cellular stability

to be rid of Sherman's ass
forever!

1683
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,266
You drink that much formula
at one time
and it will kill you!

01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:33,601
lf l drink it all at once,
yes.

1685
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:35,737
lf l drink half now
and half later, that's safe.

to worry about turning
into no Klumpkin.

a date at the alumni ball,

No, no, no, child.
Not a wild party.
Not Sherman.

1692
01:19:51,987 --> 01:19:54,055
He's too shy
for something like that.
He hates parties.

1693
01:19:54,056 --> 01:19:57,458
ln fact, we tried
to have a party for Sherman
when he was 1·-years-old

1694
01:19:57,459 --> 01:20:00,662
and he's so shy,
he didn't even show up.

1695

Well, l must admit,
it didn't seem like
the Sherman l knew.

Oh, no, not my baby.

1697
01:20:04,266 --> 01:20:05,767
Maybe he loaned his house
out to somebody

01:20:05,768 --> 01:20:07,268
or one of his buddies
was throwing a party.
