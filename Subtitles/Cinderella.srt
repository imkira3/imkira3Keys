1
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:17,308
Cinderella

2
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,853
You're as lovely as your name

3
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:24,023
Cinderella

4
00:00:24,108 --> 00:00:28,653
You're a sunset in a frame

5
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,531
Though you're dressed in rags

6
00:00:31,615 --> 00:00:36,536
You wear an air of queenly grace

7
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,996
Anyone can see

8
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:44,711
A throne would be your proper place

9
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,047
Cinderella

10
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:51,551
If you give your heart a chance

11
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:54,679
It will lead you

12
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:59,100
To the kingdom of romance

13
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:05,398
There you'll see your dreams unfold

14
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:14,031
Cinderella

15
00:01:14,116 --> 00:01:16,868
In the sweetest story

16
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:21,247
Ever told

17
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,141
Once upon a time,
in a faraway land,

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,185
there was a tiny kingdom,

19
00:01:44,146 --> 00:01:48,149
peaceful, prosperous,
and rich in romance and tradition.

20
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:54,489
Here, in a stately chateau,

21
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:56,449
there lived a widowed gentleman

22
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:58,785
and his little daughter, Cinderella.

23
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:03,539
Although he was
a kind and devoted father,

24
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,793
and gave his beloved child
every luxury and comfort,

25
00:02:06,877 --> 00:02:10,087
still, he felt she needed
a mother's care.

26
00:02:10,172 --> 00:02:11,923
And so, he married again,

27
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:15,593
choosing for his second wife
a woman of good family,

28
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,429
with two daughters
just Cinderella's age,

29
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:22,183
by name, Anastasia and Drizella.

30
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:28,064
It was upon the untimely death
of this good man, however,

31
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:30,983
that the stepmother's
true nature was revealed.

32
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:33,653
Cold, cruel, and bitterly jealous

33
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,738
of Cinderella's charm and beauty,

34
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,407
she was grimly determined
to forward the interests

35
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:40,493
of her own two awkward daughters.

36
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,957
Thus, as time went by,

37
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,209
the chateau fell into disrepair.

38
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,294
For the family fortunes
were squandered

39
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:52,755
upon the vain and selfish stepsisters,

40
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,092
while Cinderella was abused,
humiliated,

41
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,637
and finally forced
to become a servant in her own house.

42
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,558
And yet, through it all,

43
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:07,270
Cinderella remained
ever gentle and kind.

44
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,898
For with each dawn,
she found new hope that someday

45
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,442
her dreams of happiness
would come true.

46
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,737
Well, it serves you right,
spoiling people's best dreams.

47
00:03:59,114 --> 00:04:01,490
Yes, I know it's a lovely morning,

48
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:04,201
but it was a lovely dream, too.

49
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,958
What kind of a dream?

50
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:13,210
Can't tell.

51
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:19,175
'Cause if you tell a wish,
it won't come true.

52
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,426
And, after all...

53
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,389
A dream is a wish

54
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:29,727
Your heart makes

55
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:35,524
When you're fast asleep

56
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:39,695
In dreams you will lose

57
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,114
Your heartaches

58
00:04:43,659 --> 00:04:47,703
Whatever you wish for

59
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:48,996
You keep

60
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,584
Have faith

61
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:59,507
In your dreams and someday

62
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:06,847
Your rainbow
will come smiling through

63
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:13,354
No matter how your heart is grieving

64
00:05:14,523 --> 00:05:18,776
If you keep on believing

65
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,948
The dream that you wish

66
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:29,412
Will come true

67
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:32,748
Oh, that clock.

68
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,584
Old killjoy.

69
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,255
I hear you. "Come on, get up," you say.

70
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,675
Time to start another day.

71
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,969
Even he orders me around.

72
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,347
Well, there's one thing.

73
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:51,809
They can't order me to stop dreaming.

74
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,729
And perhaps someday...

75
00:05:54,813 --> 00:05:58,649
The dreams that I wish

76
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:04,030
Will come true

77
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:15,059
No matter how your heart is grieving

78
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:20,648
If you keep on believing

79
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,152
The dream that you wish

80
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:30,449
Will come true

81
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:33,285
- Look what I found.
- Over there, Cinderella.

82
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,412
Wait a minute.

83
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:37,206
One at a time, please.

84
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,959
Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?

85
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,377
New mouse in the house.

86
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,337
Brand-new. Never saw it before.

87
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,006
- Visitor. Visitor!
- Oh, a visitor.

88
00:07:46,508 --> 00:07:48,551
Well, she'll need a dress...

89
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,138
- No, no, no.
- It's not a she, it's a he.

90
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,932
- He, he.
- Oh, that does make a difference.

91
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,936
- He'll need a jacket and shoes...
- Gotta get him out!

92
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,063
- It's in a rat trap.
- Where?

93
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,691
In a trap? Why didn't you say so?

94
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,583
Now, now, calm down, everybody.

95
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:25,421
Oh, the poor little thing's
scared to death.

96
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,382
Jaq, maybe you better
explain things to him.

97
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,801
Zuk, zuk, Cinderelly.

98
00:08:30,886 --> 00:08:33,554
Now, now. Look, little guy.

99
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,390
Take it easy. Nothin' to worry about.

100
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,143
We like you. Cinderelly likes you, too.

101
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,895
She's nice, very nice.

102
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:44,356
That's better. Come on, now. Zuk, zuk.

103
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,400
Zuk, zuk.

104
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,905
Well, that's better.

105
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:56,118
Well, let's just slip it on for size.

106
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,165
It is a little snug.

107
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,042
But it'll have to do.

108
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,085
Now, for a name.

109
00:09:05,837 --> 00:09:08,923
I've got one. Octavius.

110
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,425
But for short, we'll call you Gus.

111
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,011
Like it, Gus? Like it? Like it?

112
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:16,096
Gus-Gus.

113
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:19,058
I've got to hurry.
See he keeps out of trouble, Jaq.

114
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,852
And don't forget
to warn him about the cat.

115
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:24,813
Zuk, zuk. Look, did you ever see a cat?

116
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,440
Cat, cat?

117
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,817
Cat, cat. Lucifer. That's him.

118
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,528
Meany, sneaky.

119
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,614
Jump at you. Bite at you.

120
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:37,368
Big, big. Big as a house.

121
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:38,869
Zuk, zuk, Lucify?

122
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,247
Lucify, zuk, zuk.

123
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:14,905
Here, kitty, kitty.

124
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,369
Come, kitty. Come on.

125
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,667
Lucifer! Come here!

126
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:48,314
I'm sorry if Your Highness
objects to an early breakfast.

127
00:10:48,398 --> 00:10:51,775
It's certainly not my idea
to feed you first.

128
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,154
It's orders. Come on.

129
00:10:56,406 --> 00:10:58,907
Lucify. Is that Lucify?

130
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,743
Zuk, Lucify. That's him.

131
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:07,291
Gus-Gus take the Lucify and look at!

132
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,667
No, Gus-Gus, no.

133
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:10,961
Now, listen here. Lucify not funny.

134
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,755
Lucify mean.

135
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,479
Bruno.

136
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:31,607
Bruno!

137
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,366
Dreaming again.

138
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,910
Chasing Lucifer?

139
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,871
Catch him this time? That's bad.

140
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,168
Suppose they heard you upstairs.

141
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,836
You know the orders.

142
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:56,548
So if you don't want
to lose that nice, warm bed,

143
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:59,176
you'd better get rid of those dreams.

144
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:01,011
Know how?

145
00:12:02,597 --> 00:12:04,348
Just learn to like cats.

146
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:10,854
No, I mean it.
Lucifer has his good points, too.

147
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,898
For one thing, he...

148
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,862
Well, sometimes he...

149
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,534
There must be
something good about him.

150
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:38,882
Bruno!

151
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,051
Oh, Bruno.

152
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,096
Come on, now. Outside.

153
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,309
I know it isn't easy,

154
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:52,563
but at least we should try
to get along together.

155
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,526
And that includes you, Your Majesty.

156
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:09,246
Breakfast time.
Everybody up. Hurry, hurry.

157
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,416
Come on, everybody,
breakfast, breakfast.

158
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,751
Come on, let's eat breakfast.

159
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:18,005
Breakfast? Breakfast!

160
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,227
Lucify. How're we gonna get out?

161
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,107
Let's see.

162
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,861
Listen, ibby-dibby. Got an idea.

163
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:44,114
Now, somebody's got to sneak out,

164
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,741
get Lucify to chase him,

165
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,994
run over to the corner
and keep Lucify there.

166
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:50,829
Then we all run out. Zuk.

167
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,498
Yuk, yuk. Out.

168
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,168
Now we choose the one to do it.
Ibby-dibby hop.

169
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,920
- Hop.
- Hop.

170
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,630
- Ready, hop.
- Hop.

171
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,881
Hop.

172
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:04,259
- Now...
- Hop, hop, hop.

173
00:14:04,344 --> 00:14:06,053
Hop.

174
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:55,871
Oh, there you are.

175
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,748
I was wondering.

176
00:15:57,832 --> 00:16:00,417
All right. Breakfast is served.

177
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:15,140
Take it easy, cluck-cluck.

178
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:20,020
Let go! Let go, now.

179
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,733
Stop that. Go on, shoo, shoo.

180
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,860
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

181
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,197
Poor little Gus.

182
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,032
Here.

183
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,617
Help yourself.

184
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,428
Where's Gus-Gus?

185
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,472
Well, guess he got away.

186
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,910
Cinderella!

187
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:44,247
All right, all right. I'm coming.

188
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,167
Oh, my goodness.
Morning, noon, and night.

189
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,503
Cinderella!

190
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,129
Coming, coming.

191
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,184
- Cinderella!
- I'm coming.

192
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,947
- Cinderella!
- In a minute.

193
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:34,881
Cinderella!

194
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,171
Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?

195
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,090
As if you care.

196
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,509
Take that ironing
and have it back in an hour.

197
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,469
One hour, you hear?

198
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:23,054
Yes, Drizella.

199
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,564
Good morning, Anastasia.

200
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,649
Well, it's about time.

201
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:36,902
Don't forget the mending.

202
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:39,362
Don't be all day getting it done, either.

203
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,740
Yes, Anastasia.

204
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,786
Well, come in, child, come in.

205
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,204
Good morning, Stepmother.

206
00:20:48,289 --> 00:20:51,041
Pick up the laundry
and get on with your duties.

207
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,709
Yes, Stepmother.

208
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,894
Oh, Mother. Oh, Mother!

209
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,063
Mother! Mother!

210
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,106
You did it. You did it on purpose.

211
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,567
Mother! Mother! Mother!

212
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:20,070
Now what did you do?

213
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:21,571
She put it there.

214
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,908
A big, ugly mouse, under my teacup.

215
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,245
All right, Lucifer.
What did you do with him?

216
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,457
Oh, you're not fooling anybody.

217
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,542
We'll just see about this.

218
00:21:34,627 --> 00:21:37,087
Come on. Let him go.

219
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,089
Now the other one.

220
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,423
Come on!

221
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:43,343
Oh, poor little Gus.

222
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,184
Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?

223
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,936
Cinderella!

224
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,646
Yes, Stepmother.

225
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:01,069
Are you gonna get it.

226
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:03,947
Close the door, Cinderella.

227
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,997
Come here.

228
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,180
- You don't think that I...
- Hold your tongue.

229
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:31,725
Now,

230
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,396
it seems we have time on our hands.

231
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,648
- But I was only trying to...
- Silence!

232
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,195
Time for vicious practical jokes.

233
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:48,324
Perhaps we can put it to better use.

234
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:50,076
Now, let me see...

235
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:54,372
There's the large carpet
in the main hall.

236
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,374
Clean it!

237
00:22:56,459 --> 00:22:59,502
And the windows, upstairs and down.

238
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,004
Wash them!

239
00:23:02,256 --> 00:23:06,009
Oh, yes.
And the tapestries and the draperies.

240
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,595
- But I just finished...
- Do them again!

241
00:23:09,013 --> 00:23:11,431
And don't forget the garden.
Scrub the terrace.

242
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,350
Sweep the halls and the stairs.
Clean the chimneys.

243
00:23:14,435 --> 00:23:18,480
And, of course, there's the mending and
the sewing and the laundry.

244
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:24,778
Oh, yes. And one more thing.

245
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,490
See that Lucifer gets his bath.

246
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,471
My son has been avoiding his
responsibilities long enough.

247
00:23:51,555 --> 00:23:54,849
It's high time he married
and settled down.

248
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,435
Of course, Your Majesty.

249
00:23:57,978 --> 00:23:59,229
But we must be patient.

250
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:01,523
I am patient!

251
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:07,278
But I'm not getting any younger,
you know.

252
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,573
I want to see my grandchildren
before I go.

253
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,409
- I understand, Sire.
- No.

254
00:24:13,494 --> 00:24:17,831
No, you don't know
what it means to see your only child

255
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:22,794
grow farther, farther,
and farther away from you.

256
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,296
I'm...

257
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:28,508
I'm lonely in this desolate old palace.

258
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,760
I... I want to hear

259
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:34,347
the pitter-patter of little feet again.

260
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,517
Now, now, Your Majesty.

261
00:24:39,061 --> 00:24:42,355
- Perhaps if we just let him alone...
- Let him alone?

262
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:46,317
With his silly romantic ideas?

263
00:24:46,402 --> 00:24:49,279
But, Sire, in matters of love...

264
00:24:49,363 --> 00:24:50,989
Love.

265
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:55,618
Just a boy meeting a girl
under the right conditions.

266
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:58,496
So, we're arranging the conditions.

267
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,374
But, Your Majesty,
if the Prince should suspect.

268
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,251
Suspect!

269
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:06,087
Look, the boy's coming home today,
isn't he?

270
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,130
Yes, Sire.

271
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,342
Well, what could be more natural than a
ball to celebrate his return?

272
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,303
Nothing, Sire.

273
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:17,348
If all the eligible maidens
in my kingdom just

274
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,727
happened to be there,

275
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:25,064
why, he's bound to show interest
in one of them, isn't he?

276
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:26,816
Isn't he?

277
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,484
Yes, Sire.

278
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,069
The moment he does...

279
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,406
Soft lights.

280
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,075
Romantic music.

281
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,578
All the trimmings!

282
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,414
It can't possibly fail.

283
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:44,042
Can it?

284
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,628
Yes, Sire. No, Sire!

285
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:49,005
Very well, Sire.

286
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,757
I shall arrange the ball for...

287
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:53,384
- Tonight.
- Tonight? Tonight!

288
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:55,094
- Oh, but, Sire...
- Tonight!

289
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:58,640
And see that every
eligible maid is there.

290
00:25:58,724 --> 00:26:01,184
Understand?

291
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,104
Yes, Your Majesty.

292
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,108
The pear-shaped toad

293
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:18,826
Sing, sweet nightingale

294
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:21,955
High

295
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,874
Above me

296
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:29,045
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

297
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:32,298
Sing, sweet nightingale

298
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:36,302
High

299
00:26:36,387 --> 00:26:40,390
Above

300
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:43,893
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

301
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:47,772
Sing, sweet nightingale

302
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:53,152
High

303
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,242
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

304
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,787
Sing, sweet

305
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:06,582
Nightingale

306
00:27:06,667 --> 00:27:11,629
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

307
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:16,009
Sing, sweet

308
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:20,305
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

309
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:23,057
Sing

310
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:29,105
Oh, sing, sweet nightingale

311
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:34,193
Oh, sing, sweet

312
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:37,488
Oh

313
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,326
Sing

314
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:44,620
Lucifer!

315
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:49,250
You mean old thing.

316
00:27:51,545 --> 00:27:53,379
I'm just going to have to
teach you a lesson.

317
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:57,383
Open in the name of the King.

318
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,596
An urgent message
from His Imperial Majesty.

319
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,349
- Thank you.
- From the King!

320
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,559
What's it say, Cinderelly?

321
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,935
What's it say, huh?

322
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,479
I don't know.

323
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:11,689
He said it's urgent.

324
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,444
Maybe I should interrupt
the music lesson.

325
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:22,617
Sing, sweet nightingale

326
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:28,081
High

327
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:31,918
You clumsy! You did it on purpose.

328
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,755
- It's her fault.
- Girls, girls. Remember,

329
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,091
above all, self-control.

330
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,344
Yes!

331
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,515
Cinderella!
I've warned you never to interrupt...

332
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:48,476
- This just arrived from the palace.
- From the palace!

333
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,061
- Give it here.
- Let me have it.

334
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,480
I'll read it.

335
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,733
Well, there's to be a ball.

336
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:58,486
- A ball!
- In honour of His Highness, the Prince.

337
00:28:58,570 --> 00:28:59,987
Oh, the Prince!

338
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,281
And, by royal command,

339
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:05,368
every eligible maiden is to attend.

340
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,870
- Why, that's us!
- And I'm so eligible.

341
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,708
That means I can go, too.

342
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:15,837
Her, dancing with the Prince.

343
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,089
I'd be honoured, Your Highness.

344
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,925
Would you mind holding my broom?

345
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,305
Well, why not?

346
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,435
After all, I'm still a member of the family.

347
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:33,396
And it says, "By royal command,

348
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,190
"every eligible maiden is to attend."

349
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:39,026
Yes, so it does.

350
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:43,906
Well, I see no reason why you can't go.

351
00:29:43,991 --> 00:29:46,325
If you get all your work done.

352
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:48,202
Oh, I will. I promise.

353
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:51,873
And if you can find
something suitable to wear.

354
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:55,293
I'm sure I can.
Oh, thank you, Stepmother.

355
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,921
Mother, do you realise
what you just said?

356
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,673
Of course.

357
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,509
I said "if."

358
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,304
Oh. "lf."

359
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,939
Isn't it lovely?

360
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:19,692
- It was my mother's.
- It's pretty, but it looks old.

361
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:24,363
Well, maybe it is old-fashioned,
but I'll fix that.

362
00:30:24,448 --> 00:30:27,325
- How do you do it?
- Wait a minute.

363
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,620
There ought to be
some good ideas in here.

364
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,331
This one.

365
00:30:33,415 --> 00:30:34,749
Oh, very nice. Nice.

366
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,584
- Like it.
- It'll be easy.

367
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,629
I'll have to shorten the sleeves,
I'll need a sash,

368
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:42,590
- a ruffle, something for a collar...
- Cinderella!

369
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,009
Oh, now what do they want?

370
00:30:45,093 --> 00:30:46,427
Cinderella!

371
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:48,971
Oh, well.

372
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,015
I guess my dress will just have to wait.

373
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:54,393
Cinderella!

374
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:56,938
All right, all right. I'm coming.

375
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:02,318
Poor Cinderelly.

376
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,072
Every time she finds a minute,
that's the time when they begin it.

377
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,074
Cinderelly, Cinderelly.

378
00:31:08,158 --> 00:31:09,951
Cinderella!

379
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:14,997
Cinderelly, Cinderelly
Night and day it's Cinderelly

380
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:17,041
Make the fire
Fix the breakfast

381
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,918
Wash the dishes
Do the moppin'

382
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,962
And the sweepin' and the dustin'

383
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:22,755
They always keep her hoppin'

384
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,298
She'd go around in circles

385
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,217
Till she's very, very dizzy

386
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:30,763
- Still they holler
- Keep her busy, Cinderelly

387
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,932
Yeah. Keep her busy.

388
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,436
You know what?

389
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,606
- Cinderelly won't go to the ball.
- What?

390
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,441
- Not go?
- What did you say?

391
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:46,612
You'll see. They'll fix her.

392
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:52,118
Work, work, work.
She'll never get her dress done.

393
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,829
Poor Cinderelly.

394
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,624
Hey! We can do it!

395
00:31:58,709 --> 00:32:00,793
We can do it
We can do it

396
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,380
We can help our Cinderelly
We can make the dress so pretty

397
00:32:04,464 --> 00:32:06,215
There's nothing to it, really

398
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:10,052
We'll tie a sash around it
Put a ribbon through it

399
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:13,556
When dancing at the ball
she'll be more beautiful than all

400
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:17,268
In the lovely dress
we make for Cinderelly

401
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:18,978
Hurry, hurry, hurry

402
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,813
Gonna help our Cinderelly

403
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,648
Got no time to dilly-dally

404
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:24,567
We got to get it goin'

405
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,527
I'll cut it with the scissors.

406
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,195
And I can do the sewing.

407
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,323
Leave the sewing to the women.

408
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:31,907
You go get some trimmin'.

409
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:35,911
And we'll make
a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo

410
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,748
We'll make a lovely dress
for Cinderelly

411
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,125
Follow me, Gus-Gus.
I know where to go.

412
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,628
It's gonna be pretty, this dress.

413
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,589
Cinderelly will be surprised.

414
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:48,924
Surprised, surprised. Very surprised.

415
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,977
And this, too, my slippers.
Don't forget...

416
00:33:00,062 --> 00:33:02,438
- Take my dress.
- Here, mend the buttonholes.

417
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:05,858
- Press my skirt and mind the ruffle.
- Cinderella?

418
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:07,735
- Yes?
- When you're through,

419
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,613
and before you begin
your regular chores,

420
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,448
I have a few little things.

421
00:33:12,532 --> 00:33:13,783
Very well.

422
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:17,286
I don't see why everyone else
has nice things to wear,

423
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,455
and I always end up in these old rags.

424
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,458
This sash! I wouldn't be seen dead in it.

425
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,794
You should talk. These beads!

426
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:26,212
I am sick of looking at them.

427
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,923
- Trash.
- Oh, I hate this.

428
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:34,637
Come on and be careful.

429
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:38,057
Yes, yes, yes. Real careful.

430
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,027
We can use that, Gus-Gus.

431
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,154
Pretty, pretty.

432
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,448
Look out. Lucify!

433
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,872
Beads!

434
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:45,416
Very pretty beads!

435
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:53,168
A dream is a wish your heart makes

436
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:57,172
When you're fast asleep

437
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,885
In dreams you will lose
your heartaches

438
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:04,263
Whatever you wish for
You keep

439
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:16,942
No matter how your heart is grieving

440
00:37:17,152 --> 00:37:18,861
If you keep on believing

441
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,906
The dream that you wish will come true

442
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,421
Okay. One, two, three, four,

443
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,423
five, six, seven, eight.

444
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:44,595
Whatever you wish for you keep

445
00:37:46,306 --> 00:37:47,848
All right.

446
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,227
Heave, ho. Heave, ho.

447
00:37:52,312 --> 00:37:53,687
Heave, ho.

448
00:37:56,983 --> 00:38:00,110
The dream that you wish will come true

449
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:02,488
Will come true

450
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,175
- Yes?
- The carriage is here.

451
00:39:06,928 --> 00:39:08,554
Why, Cinderella,

452
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:11,390
- you're not ready, child.
- I'm not going.

453
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:14,977
Not going? Oh, what a shame.

454
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,397
But, of course, there will be other times.

455
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,107
Yes. Good night.

456
00:39:31,036 --> 00:39:32,995
Oh, well.

457
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,913
What's a royal ball?

458
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:39,918
After all, I suppose
it would be frightfully dull,

459
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:43,505
and boring, and completely...

460
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:46,216
Completely wonderful.

461
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:56,393
- It's my...
- Surprise!

462
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,312
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

463
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,857
- Happy birthday!
- No, no, no, no!

464
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:04,359
Well, I never dreamed it.

465
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,029
It's such a surprise.

466
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,616
Oh, how can I ever...

467
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:13,744
Oh, thank you so much.

468
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:23,378
Remember, when you're
presented to His Highness,

469
00:40:23,463 --> 00:40:25,130
- be sure...
- Wait!

470
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,925
Please, wait for me.

471
00:40:28,802 --> 00:40:32,054
Isn't it lovely? Do you like it?

472
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:34,014
Do you think it will do?

473
00:40:36,059 --> 00:40:37,768
- Cinderella!
- Mother, she can't.

474
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:40,020
- Oh, no.
- You can't!

475
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,522
Girls, please.

476
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,526
After all, we did make a bargain.

477
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,486
Didn't we, Cinderella?

478
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:52,825
And I never go back on my word.

479
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,578
How very clever.

480
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,413
These beads,

481
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,458
they give it just the right touch.

482
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,086
Don't you think so, Drizella?

483
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,505
No, I don't. I think she's...

484
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:09,174
Why, you little thief!

485
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,261
They're my beads. Give them here.

486
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:13,762
Oh, no.

487
00:41:13,847 --> 00:41:15,973
And look, that's my sash.
She's wearing my sash.

488
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,851
- Mine!
- Oh, please.

489
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:21,103
Please, no.

490
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,688
Thief!

491
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,859
Girls, girls.

492
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:30,654
That's quite enough.
Hurry along now, both of you.

493
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:33,824
I won't have you upsetting yourselves.

494
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:39,913
Good night.

495
00:42:19,495 --> 00:42:24,791
You will lose your heartache

496
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:28,879
Whatever you wish for
You'll keep

497
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:31,673
Oh, no. No, it isn't true.

498
00:42:31,758 --> 00:42:36,094
Have faith in your dreams
and someday

499
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:38,388
It's just no use.

500
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,974
Your rainbow
will come smiling through

501
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:42,809
No use at all.

502
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:48,273
No matter how your heart is grieving

503
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:50,943
If you keep on believing

504
00:42:51,027 --> 00:42:54,029
I can't believe. Not any more.

505
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,156
The dream that you wish

506
00:42:56,241 --> 00:42:58,367
Will come true

507
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,869
There's nothing left to believe in.

508
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:02,204
Nothing.

509
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,790
Nothing, my dear?

510
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:08,293
- Oh, now you don't really mean that.
- Oh, but I do.

511
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:10,212
Nonsense, child!

512
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,632
If you'd lost all your faith,
I couldn't be here.

513
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,342
And here I am.

514
00:43:15,635 --> 00:43:19,096
Oh, come now. Dry those tears.

515
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:21,306
You can't go to the ball looking like that.

516
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:22,432
The ball?

517
00:43:22,517 --> 00:43:24,935
- Oh, but I'm not...
- Of course, you are.

518
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,395
But we have to hurry,

519
00:43:26,479 --> 00:43:28,730
because even miracles take a little time.

520
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:32,317
- Miracles?
- Watch.

521
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,362
What in the world did I do
with that magic wand? I was sure...

522
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,613
Magic wand?

523
00:43:36,698 --> 00:43:38,282
That's strange.

524
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:41,076
- I always...
- Then you must be...

525
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,288
Your fairy godmother? Of course.

526
00:43:44,372 --> 00:43:46,748
Where is that wand? I...

527
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,418
Oh! I forgot.

528
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:51,003
I put it away.

529
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:55,215
Look at what she did.

530
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,758
How'd she do it?

531
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,886
Now, let's see.

532
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,140
I'd say the first thing you need is

533
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:05,559
- a pumpkin.
- A pumpkin?

534
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,187
Now the magic words.

535
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:19,114
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

536
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,283
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

537
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,410
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

538
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:27,956
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

539
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,292
It'll do magic
Believe it or not

540
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,461
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

541
00:44:32,545 --> 00:44:36,965
Now sala-gadoola means
Menchika-boolaroo

542
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,468
But the thing-a-ma-bob
that does the job

543
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,179
Is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

544
00:44:42,263 --> 00:44:46,808
Sala-gadoola-menchika-boo-la
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

545
00:44:46,893 --> 00:44:48,977
Put 'em together
and what have you got?

546
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:52,939
Bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

547
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,692
Oh, looky.

548
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:57,569
Isn't it wonderful?

549
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,697
Oh, it's beautiful.

550
00:45:00,782 --> 00:45:03,200
Yes, isn't it?

551
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:05,702
With an elegant coach like that,
of course,

552
00:45:05,787 --> 00:45:08,580
we'll simply have to have

553
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:11,458
- mice!
- Mice?

554
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:14,002
Oh, this really is nice.

555
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:17,172
Why, we'll have a coach
and four when we're through.

556
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,717
Just a wave of my stick
and to finish the trick,

557
00:45:20,802 --> 00:45:23,720
bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

558
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,847
Gracious, what did I do?

559
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:29,726
I was sure there were four.
There should be one more.

560
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:31,812
There you are.

561
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,315
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

562
00:45:45,618 --> 00:45:47,828
Oh, poor Lucifer.

563
00:45:47,912 --> 00:45:50,205
Serves him right, I'd say. Now...

564
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:53,208
Where were we? Oh, goodness, yes.

565
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,836
You can't go to the ball without

566
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,379
a horse.

567
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,964
Another one?

568
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:03,135
But tonight, for a change,
you will handle the reins,

569
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:05,637
and sit in the driver's seat, too.

570
00:46:06,097 --> 00:46:09,683
For instead of a horse,
you're the coachman, of course.

571
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,685
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

572
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,234
That does it, I guess, except for...
Oh, yes!

573
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:22,446
The finishing touch. And, that's you.

574
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,324
Yes, Bruno, that's right,
you'll be footman tonight.

575
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,994
Bibbidi, bobbidi, boo.

576
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:32,998
Well, well, hop in, my dear.
We can't waste time.

577
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:35,792
- But...
- No, don't try to thank me.

578
00:46:35,877 --> 00:46:39,546
Oh, I wasn't... I mean, I do, but...

579
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,298
But, don't you think my dress...

580
00:46:41,382 --> 00:46:44,217
Yes, it's lovely, dear.

581
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:48,221
Good heavens, child.
You can't go in that!

582
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:52,100
Now, let's see, dear.

583
00:46:52,185 --> 00:46:56,438
Your size and the shade of your eyes.

584
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:59,649
Something simple, but daring, too.

585
00:46:59,734 --> 00:47:03,487
Oh, just leave it to me.
What a gown this will be.

586
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,198
Bibbidi-bobbidi.
Bibbidi-bobbidi.

587
00:47:06,282 --> 00:47:08,617
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo.

588
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:14,080
Oh, it's a beautiful dress.

589
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:17,375
Did you ever see
such a beautiful dress?

590
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,212
And, look, glass slippers.

591
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:24,132
Why, it's like a dream.

592
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:27,135
A wonderful dream come true.

593
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,803
Yes, my child.

594
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:30,555
But, like all dreams,

595
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,433
well, I'm afraid this can't last forever.

596
00:47:33,518 --> 00:47:35,560
You'll have only till midnight, and then...

597
00:47:35,645 --> 00:47:37,229
Midnight? Thank you.

598
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,690
Now, now, now, just a minute.
You must understand, my dear,

599
00:47:40,775 --> 00:47:43,985
on the stroke of 12:00
the spell will be broken,

600
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,655
and everything will be as it was before.

601
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:48,990
Oh, I understand, but

602
00:47:49,075 --> 00:47:51,743
it's more than I ever hoped for.

603
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:53,537
Bless you, my child.

604
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:56,122
I... Goodness me!

605
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:59,459
It's getting late.
Hurry up, dear. The ball can't wait.

606
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,878
Have a good time.
Dance, be gay.

607
00:48:01,963 --> 00:48:04,130
Now, off you go.
You're on your way.

608
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:06,508
With a bibbidi-bobbidi
Bibbidi-bobbidi

609
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,260
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo

610
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:39,916
Princess Frederica
Eugenie de la Fontain.

611
00:48:44,297 --> 00:48:47,090
Mademoiselle
Augustina DuBois.

612
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:50,594
Daughter of General Pierre DuBois.

613
00:49:01,147 --> 00:49:03,982
The boy isn't cooperating.

614
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:08,945
Mademoiselle Leonora
Mercedes de la Tour.

615
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:13,450
Daughter of Colonel
and Madame de la Tour.

616
00:49:19,999 --> 00:49:22,500
I can't understand it.

617
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,629
There must be at least one
who'd make a suitable mother.

618
00:49:25,713 --> 00:49:27,589
Sire.

619
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:30,133
A suitable wife.

620
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:54,783
Mademoiselles
Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine.

621
00:49:54,867 --> 00:49:57,535
Daughters of Lady Tremaine.

622
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:07,337
I give up.
Even I couldn't expect the boy to...

623
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,965
Well, if I may say so,
Your Majesty, I did try to warn you,

624
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:14,886
but you, Sire, are incurably romantic.

625
00:50:15,346 --> 00:50:19,933
No doubt you saw
the whole pretty picture in detail.

626
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,354
The young Prince
bowing to the assembly.

627
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:28,233
Suddenly he stops. He looks up.

628
00:50:28,317 --> 00:50:31,861
For, lo, there she stands.

629
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:34,239
The girl of his dreams.

630
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,909
Who she is or whence she came,

631
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,829
he knows not, nor does he care,

632
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:43,707
for his heart tells him that here,

633
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:48,837
here is the maid
predestined to be his bride.

634
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:53,341
A pretty plot for fairy tales, Sire.

635
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,552
But in real life, oh, no.

636
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,930
No! It was foredoomed to failure.

637
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,808
Failure, eh?

638
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,061
Take a look at that,
you pompous windbag.

639
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,689
Who is she?

640
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,858
- You know her?
- No, Sire.

641
00:51:09,942 --> 00:51:12,026
I've never seen her before.

642
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,404
That's one thing in her favour.

643
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:16,448
The waltz. Quick, the waltz!

644
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:23,329
Lights. The lights.

645
00:51:42,308 --> 00:51:44,726
Failure, eh?

646
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:52,066
Well... Now for a good night's sleep.

647
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:54,861
Oh, quite so, Sire. I believe I, too...

648
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,697
You will stay right here.

649
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,409
See they're not disturbed,
and when the boy proposes,

650
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:04,579
notify me immediately.

651
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,122
Notify me immediately.

652
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:07,916
And remember,

653
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,502
if anything goes wrong...

654
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:29,395
- Who is she, Mother?
- Do we know her?

655
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,940
Well, the Prince certainly seems to.

656
00:52:32,024 --> 00:52:34,108
I know I've never seen her.

657
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,527
Nor I.

658
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:38,613
But she certainly is... Wait.

659
00:52:39,365 --> 00:52:41,950
There is something familiar about her.

660
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,461
Ahem.

661
00:53:02,972 --> 00:53:11,980
So this is love

662
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:15,984
So this is what makes life

663
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:19,195
Divine

664
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,782
I'm all aglow

665
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:27,203
- And now I know
- And now I know

666
00:53:27,288 --> 00:53:31,791
The key to all Heaven

667
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:35,336
Is mine

668
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:39,424
My heart has wings

669
00:53:39,508 --> 00:53:43,511
And I can fly

670
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:47,432
I'll touch every star

671
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:50,768
In the sky

672
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:56,900
So this is the miracle

673
00:53:56,984 --> 00:54:02,780
That I've been dreaming of

674
00:54:11,832 --> 00:54:14,250
So this

675
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:16,961
Is

676
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:20,465
Love

677
00:54:23,886 --> 00:54:25,470
Oh. Oh, my goodness.

678
00:54:25,554 --> 00:54:27,305
What's the matter?

679
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,640
It's midnight.

680
00:54:28,724 --> 00:54:30,725
Yes, so it is. But why...

681
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:33,102
- Goodbye.
- No, no, wait.

682
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:35,897
- You can't go now. It's only...
- Oh, I must. Please.

683
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,607
- Please, I must.
- But why?

684
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,943
Well, I... Oh, the Prince,

685
00:54:40,027 --> 00:54:41,486
I haven't met the Prince.

686
00:54:41,570 --> 00:54:42,904
The Prince?

687
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,113
But didn't you know...

688
00:54:45,407 --> 00:54:47,575
- Goodbye.
- No, wait.

689
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:49,953
Come back. Please come back.

690
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:52,872
I don't even know your name.
How will I find you?

691
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,499
Wait! Please wait.

692
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:56,960
Goodbye.

693
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,796
Oh, I say. Young lady.

694
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:03,091
- Wait!
- The Prince!

695
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:13,851
Just a moment.

696
00:55:14,895 --> 00:55:17,605
Guard! Guard!

697
00:55:18,691 --> 00:55:22,193
Stop that coach! Close those gates!

698
00:55:25,197 --> 00:55:27,115
Follow that coach!

699
00:55:27,199 --> 00:55:29,575
Open those gates!

700
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:07,739
I'm sorry.

701
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:11,743
I guess I forgot about everything.

702
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,495
Even the time, but...

703
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,708
But it was so wonderful.

704
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:21,669
And he was so handsome,

705
00:56:21,754 --> 00:56:24,172
and when we danced...

706
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:27,884
Oh, I'm sure even the Prince
himself couldn't have been more...

707
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:29,177
More...

708
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:33,014
- Oh, well, it's over and...
- Cinderelly.

709
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,099
Look, look! The slippers!

710
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:36,309
Yeah, your slipper.

711
00:56:36,393 --> 00:56:38,603
Your slipper, Cinderelly.

712
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:44,067
Thank you.

713
00:56:44,777 --> 00:56:47,695
Thank you so much, for everything.

714
00:56:57,539 --> 00:57:01,918
Your Majesty,
I see no point in beating about the bush.

715
00:57:02,002 --> 00:57:03,961
I regret to inform you, Sire,

716
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:06,214
that the young lady has disappeared,

717
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,092
leaving behind only this glass slipper.

718
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:10,968
Yes. I'll do it.

719
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:16,307
No. I just can't.

720
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,629
Well, come in.

721
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:48,756
Come in!

722
00:57:48,841 --> 00:57:52,051
- Your Majesty...
- So, he's proposed already?

723
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:53,594
- Tell me about it.
- Well...

724
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:56,097
- Who is she?
- I didn't get a chance...

725
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,808
No matter. We've more
important things to discuss.

726
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,560
Arrangements for the wedding,

727
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:03,271
invitations, a national holiday.

728
00:58:03,981 --> 00:58:06,232
- All that sort of thing.
- But, Sire...

729
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,985
Here. Have a cigar. Take a few more.

730
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:10,570
But...

731
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,447
Better practise passing these out, eh?

732
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,784
But, if you'd only listen.

733
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:18,619
And for you, my friend.

734
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:22,456
- Your Majesty, please...
- A knighthood.

735
00:58:22,541 --> 00:58:25,042
I hereby dub you Sir...

736
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,921
By the way, what title would you like?

737
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,466
- Sire? She got away.
- Sir "She Got Away"?

738
00:58:32,551 --> 00:58:34,719
A peculiar title, but if that's what you...

739
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:38,389
She what? Why, you...

740
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,641
You... You traitor!

741
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:43,644
Now, Sire.
Remember, your blood pressure.

742
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,605
Treason!

743
00:58:48,442 --> 00:58:49,984
No, Sire. No!

744
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,445
Sabotage!

745
00:58:53,405 --> 00:58:55,323
You were in league with the Prince.

746
00:58:55,407 --> 00:58:57,450
I tried to stop her,

747
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,410
but she vanished into thin air.

748
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,245
A likely story.

749
00:59:01,330 --> 00:59:04,665
But it's true, Sire.
All we could find was this glass slipper.

750
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:07,251
The whole thing was a plot!

751
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:10,838
But, Sire, he loves her.

752
00:59:10,923 --> 00:59:12,840
He won't rest till he finds her.

753
00:59:12,925 --> 00:59:14,842
He's determined to marry her.

754
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:19,180
What? What did you say?

755
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:22,141
The Prince, Sire,
swears he'll marry none

756
00:59:22,226 --> 00:59:24,352
but the girl who fits this slipper.

757
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:26,229
He said that, did he?

758
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:29,857
We've got him!

759
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:38,366
But, Sire, this slipper
may fit one of any number of girls.

760
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,327
That's his problem. He's given his word.

761
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,538
- We'll hold him to it.
- No, Your Highness.

762
00:59:44,623 --> 00:59:46,624
I'll have nothing to do with it.

763
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,418
You'll try this
on every maid in my kingdom.

764
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:50,753
And if the shoe fits,

765
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:54,215
bring her in.

766
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:57,093
Yes, Your Majesty.

767
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,192
Cinderella? Cinderella?

768
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:16,362
- Cinderella! Where is that...
- Yes?

769
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,780
Here I am.

770
01:00:18,323 --> 01:00:19,740
My daughters, where are they?

771
01:00:19,825 --> 01:00:21,325
I think they're still in bed.

772
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:26,831
Don't just stand there!
Bring up the breakfast trays at once.

773
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,124
And hurry!

774
01:00:29,084 --> 01:00:31,335
Wow. I wonder what's the matter.

775
01:00:31,420 --> 01:00:33,129
What's the matter with her?

776
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,423
I don't know. Let's find out. Come on.

777
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:45,433
Drizella. Drizella!

778
01:00:45,517 --> 01:00:47,643
What?

779
01:00:47,728 --> 01:00:49,687
Get up. Quick. This instant.

780
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:51,647
We haven't a moment to lose.

781
01:00:52,858 --> 01:00:55,985
Anastasia.

782
01:00:58,739 --> 01:00:59,989
Get up, Anastasia.

783
01:01:01,116 --> 01:01:03,326
What for? Why?

784
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:06,245
Everyone's talking about it,
the whole kingdom.

785
01:01:06,538 --> 01:01:08,831
- Hurry now. He'll be here any minute.
- Who will?

786
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,959
The Grand Duke.
He's been hunting all night.

787
01:01:12,044 --> 01:01:14,128
- Hunting?
- For that girl.

788
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,756
The one who lost
her slipper at the ball last night.

789
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,799
They say he's madly in love with her.

790
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:22,511
- The Duke is?
- No, no, no. The Prince!

791
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,847
The Prince!

792
01:01:26,475 --> 01:01:28,768
You clumsy little fool.

793
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:32,146
Clean that up,
then help my daughters dress.

794
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,481
What for?

795
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:35,649
If he's in love with that girl,

796
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:37,485
why should we even bother?

797
01:01:37,569 --> 01:01:40,363
Now, you two, listen to me.

798
01:01:40,447 --> 01:01:43,491
There is still a chance
that one of you can get it.

799
01:01:43,575 --> 01:01:46,911
One of us?
Why, Mother, what do you mean?

800
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,662
Just this:

801
01:01:48,747 --> 01:01:52,333
No one, not even the Prince,
knows who that girl is.

802
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:55,169
We know! We know! Cinderelly!

803
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,797
The glass slipper is their only clue.

804
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:00,383
The Duke has been ordered to try it on

805
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:01,842
every girl in the kingdom.

806
01:02:01,927 --> 01:02:05,054
And if one can be found
whom the slipper fits,

807
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:07,515
then, by the King's command,

808
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:10,101
that girl shall be the Prince's bride.

809
01:02:10,185 --> 01:02:13,020
- His bride.
- His bride!

810
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:15,439
Cinderella, get my things together.

811
01:02:15,524 --> 01:02:17,441
Never mind her. Get mine right away.

812
01:02:25,117 --> 01:02:27,368
What's the matter with her?

813
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:30,913
- Wake up, stupid.
- We've gotta get dressed.

814
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:34,375
Dressed. Oh, yes.

815
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:36,127
Oh, we must get dressed.

816
01:02:36,211 --> 01:02:38,504
It wouldn't do for the Duke to see me...

817
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:40,256
Mother, did you see what she did?

818
01:02:40,340 --> 01:02:42,800
- Are you just going to let her...
- Quiet!

819
01:02:44,553 --> 01:02:47,555
So this is love

820
01:03:00,986 --> 01:03:02,445
What's she gonna do?

821
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:04,155
I don't know. Gotta watch.

822
01:03:04,239 --> 01:03:05,489
Come on.

823
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,016
- Cinderelly!
- Cinderelly!

824
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,186
So this is the miracle

825
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,354
That I've been dreaming of

826
01:03:41,735 --> 01:03:43,360
What?

827
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:46,447
Oh, no!

828
01:03:46,865 --> 01:03:48,491
No, please!

829
01:03:48,617 --> 01:03:51,160
Oh, you can't, you just can't.

830
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:54,121
Let me out! You must let me out!

831
01:03:54,206 --> 01:03:57,208
You can't keep me in here!

832
01:03:57,292 --> 01:04:00,127
Oh, please.

833
01:04:00,212 --> 01:04:03,339
No, no. She can't do it.
She can't lock up Cinderelly.

834
01:04:03,423 --> 01:04:04,840
I'm gonna...

835
01:04:04,925 --> 01:04:07,134
Please. Please.

836
01:04:07,219 --> 01:04:10,846
We gotta get that key, Gus-Gus.
We just gotta get that key.

837
01:04:16,478 --> 01:04:17,895
Whoa.

838
01:04:22,776 --> 01:04:24,985
He's over here, the Duke-Duke.

839
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:28,113
- Yeah, yeah. Who?
- The Grand Duke, with the slipper.

840
01:04:28,198 --> 01:04:29,365
We gotta get that key quick.

841
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:31,367
Yup, yup. Key, key. Quick.

842
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,580
Oh, Mother, Mother,
he's here, he's here.

843
01:04:36,665 --> 01:04:38,707
- The Grand Duke.
- Do I look all right?

844
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,919
- I'm so excited, I don't know what I'll do.
- Girls.

845
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:45,422
Now, remember,
this is your last chance. Don't fail me.

846
01:04:50,345 --> 01:04:54,014
Announcing
His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke.

847
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:56,892
You honour our humble home.

848
01:04:56,977 --> 01:04:58,018
Quite so.

849
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:00,854
May I present my daughters,

850
01:05:00,939 --> 01:05:03,732
Drizella, Anastasia.

851
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:05,192
Your Grace.

852
01:05:07,112 --> 01:05:08,988
Yes. Charmed, I'm sure.

853
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:12,449
His Grace will read
the royal proclamation.

854
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:17,997
"All loyal subjects
of His Imperial Majesty

855
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,375
"are hereby notified by royal
proclamation in regard to a certain

856
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,920
"glass slipper.

857
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,089
"It is decreed..."

858
01:05:27,173 --> 01:05:30,092
Why, that's my slipper!

859
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:33,345
Well, I like that. It's my slipper!

860
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:36,724
No, no, no! It's Cinderelly's slipper!

861
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:39,727
- How can she stand there...
- Girls.

862
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:41,312
Your manners.

863
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:44,898
A thousand pardons, Your Grace.

864
01:05:44,983 --> 01:05:46,525
Please continue.

865
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,943
Yes, quite so.

866
01:05:48,028 --> 01:05:51,697
Oh, yes.
"It is upon this day decreed

867
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,992
"that a quest be instituted throughout...

868
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:58,829
"The sole and express
purpose of such quest to be as follows:

869
01:06:00,540 --> 01:06:03,584
"That every maid throughout the
kingdom without exception,

870
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:06,587
"shall try on her foot
this slipper of glass,

871
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:10,382
"and should one be found upon whose
foot this slipper shall properly fit,

872
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:16,096
"such maiden shall be
acclaimed the object of this search

873
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:19,433
"and shall be looked upon
as the true love of His Royal Highness,

874
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:23,187
"our beloved son and heir,
the noble Prince.

875
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:26,649
"Said Prince will, upon bended knee

876
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:29,109
"beg, request, or if need be, implore

877
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:32,655
"said maiden that he be granted her
hand in marriage.

878
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:35,157
"Whereupon,

879
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:38,702
"look with favour,
shall the couple pledge their troth...

880
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:45,417
"And in due course, upon the inevitable
demise of His Majesty the King,

881
01:06:45,502 --> 01:06:47,795

to rule over the land

882
01:06:47,879 --> 01:06:50,756
"as King and Queen of our kingdom.

883
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,049
"So be it."

884
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:57,137
You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace.

885
01:06:57,222 --> 01:06:59,640
May we offer you some tea?

886
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:02,309
What? Tea?

887
01:07:02,394 --> 01:07:04,687
Thank you, madam, no.

888
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:07,356
We must proceed with the fitting.

889
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,817
Of course. Anastasia, dear.

890
01:07:14,072 --> 01:07:16,865
There. I knew it was my slipper.

891
01:07:17,492 --> 01:07:18,992
Exactly my size.

892
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:20,911
I always wear the same size.

893
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:22,871
As soon as I saw it, I said...

894
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,832
Oh, well...

895
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,668
It may be a trifle snug today.

896
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:30,337
You know how it is, dancing all night.

897
01:07:30,422 --> 01:07:32,297
I can't understand why.

898
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:34,425
It's always fit perfectly before.

899
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:36,719
I don't think you're half trying.

900
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:39,847
Mother, can you...

901
01:07:39,931 --> 01:07:43,225
Quiet, my dear.
We mustn't disturb His Grace.

902
01:07:43,309 --> 01:07:46,854
Young man, are you sure
you're trying it on the right foot?

903
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:52,359
Oh, it's the right foot, but...

904
01:07:52,444 --> 01:07:54,194
These glass shoes
aren't always reliable.

905
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:56,196
Come on, hurry.

906
01:07:56,281 --> 01:07:58,157
Up the stairs, up the stairs!

907
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,994
Lucify, Lucify.

908
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:07,791
Up, up, up with it.

909
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:18,969
Here.

910
01:08:34,986 --> 01:08:36,904
Why can't you hold still a minute?

911
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:40,032
My word. Enough of this!

912
01:08:42,702 --> 01:08:44,745
The next young lady, please.

913
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,455
Did you hear that, Gus?

914
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,582
- Yup.
- Gotta hurry.

915
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,340
Come on, come on, hurry.

916
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,850
Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus, come on.

917
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:09,770
Look, look. Just up there. Come on.

918
01:09:18,655 --> 01:09:20,823
Us is coming, Cinderelly.

919
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,492
- I can get you out.
- You've got the key!

920
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:26,495
How did you ever manage to...

921
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:28,163
Lucifer!

922
01:09:28,248 --> 01:09:30,541
Let him go, Lucifer.

923
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:33,168
Please, let him go.

924
01:09:33,795 --> 01:09:35,754
- Let him go.
- Let him go!

925
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,298
Let him go. Let him out, you hear?

926
01:09:38,383 --> 01:09:40,133
Lucify, you...

927
01:10:18,256 --> 01:10:21,592
Bruno. Yes, Bruno!

928
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:24,803
Quick, get Bruno. Get Bruno!

929
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:48,285
Of all the stupid little idiots.

930
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:50,954
I'll do it myself.

931
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:52,748
Get away from me.

932
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:55,876
I'll make it fit.

933
01:10:56,461 --> 01:10:58,295
- There.
- It fits.

934
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,630
It fits?

935
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,842
No!

936
01:11:09,891 --> 01:11:12,601
Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry.

937
01:11:12,977 --> 01:11:14,519
It shan't happen again.

938
01:11:14,604 --> 01:11:16,063
Precisely, madam.

939
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:45,342
Come on, come on.
Get up, Gus-Gus, get up.

940
01:11:45,885 --> 01:11:47,844
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

941
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,472
Let go, let go.

942
01:11:55,103 --> 01:11:58,188
You are the only ladies
in the household I hope... I presume.

943
01:11:58,272 --> 01:12:00,983
- There's no one else, Your Grace.
- Quite so.

944
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,652
- Good day. Good day.
- Your Grace?

945
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:06,780
Your Grace, please, wait.

946
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,991
May I try it on?

947
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:11,910
- Pay no attention.
- It's Cinderella.

948
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:13,870
- From the kitchen.
- Ridiculous.

949
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:15,998
She's out of her mind.

950
01:12:16,082 --> 01:12:18,000
Just an imaginative child.

951
01:12:18,084 --> 01:12:21,086
Madam,
my orders were "every maiden."

952
01:12:22,630 --> 01:12:24,172
Come, my child.

953
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,106
Oh, no.

954
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,650
No, no, no. Oh, no!

955
01:12:43,735 --> 01:12:45,777
Oh, this is terrible.

956
01:12:45,862 --> 01:12:48,071
The King, what will he say?

957
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:50,323
What will he do?

958
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:51,950
Perhaps, if it would help...

959
01:12:52,035 --> 01:12:55,454
No, no. Nothing can help now. Nothing.

960
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,539
But, you see, I have the other slipper.

961
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,622
Have faith in dreams

962
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:41,416
And someday

963
01:13:41,501 --> 01:13:47,047
Your rainbow
will come smiling through

964
01:13:47,131 --> 01:13:51,927
No matter how your heart is grieving

965
01:13:52,011 --> 01:13:56,181
If you keep on believing

966
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:59,518
The dream that you wish

967
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:03,605
Will come true
