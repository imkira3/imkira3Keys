<i>Dinosaurs are in our world.</i>

6
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,017
<i>And with every confrontation,</i>
<i>we learn more</i>

7
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:28,922
<i>about this frightening</i>
<i>new reality.</i>

8
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,232
-- <i> How did we get here?</i>

9
00:01:33,367 --> 00:01:34,826
-- Oh, my God.

10
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,402
<i>It's been three decades</i>

11
00:01:36,537 --> 00:01:38,405
<i>since the deadly events</i>
<i>at Jurassic Park,</i>

12
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,434
<i>and we've yet to find a way</i>
<i>for these animals</i>

13
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,404
<i>to live safely among us.</i>

14
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,904
<i>After the devastating eruption</i>

15
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,205
<i>of Isla Nublar's</i>
<i>long-dormant volcano,</i>

16
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:49,513
<i>those who survived were</i>
<i>transported to the mainland.</i>

17
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:52,284
Many of the larger predators
were captured,

18
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,612
but the remaining creatures
scattered here

19
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,121
in Big Rock National Park.

20
00:01:57,256 --> 00:01:59,216
While most remained in the wild,

21
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:01,087
<i>those who made their way</i>
<i>to civilization</i>

22
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,554
<i>struggled to adapt</i>
<i>to unfamiliar conditions.</i>

23
00:02:03,689 --> 00:02:07,399
<i>Local authorities have warned</i>
<i>the animals are unpredictable</i>

24
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:10,468
<i>and, when hungry,</i>
<i>extremely violent.</i>

25
00:02:10,603 --> 00:02:13,365
<i>As the dinosaurs spread</i>
<i>across borders,</i>

26
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,371
<i>-a global black market has</i>
<i>risen.</i> -- They're not ours.

27
00:02:15,506 --> 00:02:18,370
Go on, you sad, pathetic loser!

28
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:21,239
- <i> To combat the growing</i>
<i>threat of illegal poachers,</i>

29
00:02:21,374 --> 00:02:23,712
<i>the U.S. Congress awarded</i>
<i>sole collection rights</i>

30
00:02:23,848 --> 00:02:27,044
<i>to the global giant</i>
<i>Biosyn Genetics.</i>

31
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,653
At Biosyn, we're dedicated
to the idea

32
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:33,888
that dinosaurs can teach us
more about ourselves.

33
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:37,663
- <i> CEO Lewis Dodgson</i>
<i>has created a sanctuary</i>

34
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:40,563
<i>in Italy's Dolomite Mountains,</i>
<i>where he hopes to study</i>

35
00:02:40,698 --> 00:02:42,929
<i>the dinosaurs'</i>
<i>ancient immune systems</i>

36

<i>for unique</i>
<i>pharmaceutical properties.</i>

37
00:02:45,298 --> 00:02:47,135
<i>While Biosyn believes</i>
<i>we can handle</i>

38
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,434
<i>genetic power responsibly,</i>
<i>the public remains skeptical.</i>

39
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,103
<i>Some note that these</i>
<i>government contracts have led</i>

40
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:56,248
to massive spikes
in Biosyn's profits.

41
00:02:56,383 --> 00:02:58,750
And rumors persist
of a human clone

42
00:02:58,886 --> 00:03:02,587
who mysteriously disappeared,
leading to a worldwide search.

43
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,687
<i>Some believe she's</i>
<i>genetically identical</i>

44
00:03:04,823 --> 00:03:06,856
<i>to Charlotte Lockwood,</i>
<i>deceased daughter</i>

<i>of Jurassic Park cofounder</i>
<i>Benjamin Lockwood.</i>

46
00:03:10,062 --> 00:03:13,058
<i>Now that we've brought these</i>
<i>animals back from extinction...</i>

47
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,833
<i>Are we responsible for them?</i>

48
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,932
<i>Or should they be left</i>
<i>to fend for themselves?</i>

49
00:03:20,068 --> 00:03:23,300
<i>As we adapt to</i>
<i>an ever-changing world,</i>

50
00:03:23,435 --> 00:03:25,774
<i>we must find answers</i>
<i>to these questions--</i>

51
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,845

- We are inside
the illegal breeding facility.

56
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:17,896
The juveniles are kept in cages
to keep costs down.

57
00:04:18,032 --> 00:04:20,230
It's medieval.

58

Claire.

59
00:04:29,908 --> 00:04:32,137
Why do you think
he's separated from the rest?

60
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:36,647
I don't think
he's gonna make it.

61
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,021
No. What are you doing?

62
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,389
We can report this.

63
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:46,960
The DFW takes days
to investigate.

64
00:04:47,096 --> 00:04:49,455
We can save this one now.

65
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,157
It's okay. It's okay, buddy.

66
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,997
-Okay. Here we go.

67
00:05:01,503 --> 00:05:03,539
Nope. No!

68
00:05:03,675 --> 00:05:05,706
-- Lift.

69
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:07,704
-Support the head.
-Yeah.

70
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:09,249
Okay. Yeah.

71
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:14,887
Okay, come on.
Come on, let's go.

-Hold on.
-To what?

74
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:48,320
Claire, we're gonna get shot!

75
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,754
-No. Claire, no! No, Claire!
-Oh, no!

76
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:06,803
Oh, shit.

77
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,773
Everybody good?

78
00:06:11,908 --> 00:06:13,645
-- No!

79
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:27,490
Okay. Okay, so I think
we get this one to the DFW,

80
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,222
and then we hit them again.

81
00:06:29,357 --> 00:06:31,865
Yeah. Yeah, you saw
that breeding ground, right?

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,665
We're done.

83
00:06:35,698 --> 00:06:36,903
I got a call last week.

84
00:06:37,038 --> 00:06:38,561
It's a real job.

85
00:06:38,697 --> 00:06:40,736
Something I could do
to effectively change things.

86
00:06:40,872 --> 00:06:42,973
-I got to take it.
-They need us.

87
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:45,479
Are you saving these dinosaurs
because they need us,

88
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,214
or are you saying them
to absolve yourself?

89
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:48,841
-- Claire.

90
00:06:48,976 --> 00:06:50,882
I mean, this is crazy. We...

91
00:06:51,018 --> 00:06:52,515
Claire.

92
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:54,346
You're doing the right thing.

93
00:06:54,482 --> 00:06:57,381
But this... this isn't the way
to go about it anymore.

94
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,226
Honestly, you need someone

95
00:07:00,361 --> 00:07:01,992
who's good at being shot at.

96
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:05,262
Aren't-aren't you and Owen
still, like, a weird thing?

97
00:07:05,398 --> 00:07:06,828
It's not that weird.

98
00:07:06,963 --> 00:07:09,368
-He didn't mean weird. No.
-Mm-mm.

99
00:07:09,503 --> 00:07:11,901
Uh, he meant, like, surprising.

100
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:33,692
Hyah!

101
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,929
â™ª â™ª

102
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:53,074

â™ª â™ª

104
00:08:14,234 --> 00:08:16,262
Hyah!

105
00:08:42,327 --> 00:08:44,158
No.

106
00:08:56,606 --> 00:08:58,337
Okay. Come here.

107
00:09:01,975 --> 00:09:03,947
Okay.

108
00:09:16,423 --> 00:09:18,698
We're gonna get you
someplace safe.

109
00:09:22,268 --> 00:09:23,802
Hey.

110
00:09:27,706 --> 00:09:30,776
There you go. There you go.

111
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,141
Yeah.

Hey.

118
00:12:33,856 --> 00:12:35,490
Where you been?

119
00:12:35,626 --> 00:12:36,726
Nowhere.

120
00:12:36,861 --> 00:12:39,193
What are you burning?

121
00:12:39,329 --> 00:12:42,561
Oh, nothing.
Just some old blankets.

122
00:12:44,401 --> 00:12:46,171
You sure you didn't
go past the bridge?

123
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,199
That's the look you give me
when you think I'm lying.

124
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:50,405
-Well, are you?
-No.

125
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,503
Maisie, you're literally
looking everywhere but here.

126
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,848
I said I didn't
go past the bridge.

127
00:12:58,913 --> 00:13:00,512
Maisie.

128
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:02,781
-Can we start over?
-I know, Claire.

129
00:13:02,917 --> 00:13:04,587
There are people out there
who'll do anything to find me.

130
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,255
I'm not angry.

131
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,085
So that means
you don't have to be angry.

132
00:13:08,221 --> 00:13:09,627
I'm not angry.

133
00:13:09,763 --> 00:13:11,254
I can take care of myself.

134
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:12,930
Hey.

135
00:13:13,066 --> 00:13:15,402
It's okay for us
to depend on each other.

136
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:17,394
That's what people do.

137
00:13:17,529 --> 00:13:19,567
How would I know what people do?

138
00:13:19,702 --> 00:13:22,231
The only people I've spoken to
in the past four years

139
00:13:22,367 --> 00:13:24,636
are you both.

140
00:13:24,772 --> 00:13:27,609
Besides, I'm not even
a real person anyway.

141
00:13:27,744 --> 00:13:28,713
What?

142
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,976
I was made from someone else.

143
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:33,383
I'm not me.

144
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:39,354
â™ª â™ª

145
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,094
You're the only you
who ever was.

146
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:45,661
What?

147
00:13:45,797 --> 00:13:47,325
No.

148
00:13:47,461 --> 00:13:48,895
Was that, like, really corny?

149
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,130
It was so corny.

150
00:13:50,265 --> 00:13:51,470
Can we keep that between us?

151
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:52,934
Can't promise that.

152
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,006
-Hey, kid.
-Hi.

153
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,480
Sorry I'm late.

154
00:14:02,615 --> 00:14:03,976
Bop, bop.

155
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,310
Aw.

156
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:07,750
You smell like horses.

157
00:14:07,885 --> 00:14:08,950
Mm.

158
00:14:09,086 --> 00:14:10,347
Oh, you like that, do you?

159
00:14:10,483 --> 00:14:11,589
-I do, yeah.
-Aw.

160
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:12,654
Okay.

161
00:14:12,789 --> 00:14:14,318
Um...

162
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,026
I'm gonna... make dinner.

163
00:14:17,161 --> 00:14:18,826
-Everything okay?

164
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:22,331
She went into town again.

165
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:25,328
This kid.

166
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:27,173
Did you talk to her?

167
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:29,199
I tried.

168
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,269
I'll talk to her.

169
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:44,254
â™ª â™ª

170
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,987
â™ª â™ª

171
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,073
All right.

172
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,576
Cut away from yourself.

173
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,883
Whoa.

174
00:16:21,018 --> 00:16:22,083
Whew.

175
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,154
-Stone-cold.
-Right?

176
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,921
I would not mess with her.

177
00:16:26,056 --> 00:16:27,625
No way.

178
00:16:33,463 --> 00:16:34,667
Listen, kiddo,
we should probably talk

179
00:16:34,803 --> 00:16:35,829
about you going into town.

180
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,399
I don't think you understand

181
00:16:38,535 --> 00:16:39,605
how bad it is
being trapped here.

182
00:16:39,741 --> 00:16:41,301
You're not trapped here.

183
00:16:41,436 --> 00:16:42,808
We just don't trust people.

184
00:16:42,943 --> 00:16:44,307
No, you just don't trust me.

185
00:16:44,442 --> 00:16:46,839
And then you expect me
to trust you.

186
00:16:46,975 --> 00:16:49,412
-Why can't I have any freedom?
-Because you can't.

187
00:16:54,545 --> 00:16:56,589
That went great.

188
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,256
What is happening?

189
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:01,156
-She's 14.
-Yeah.

190
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,228
You remember what that was like.

191
00:17:04,226 --> 00:17:05,824
I do.

192
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:08,801
We can't keep her here forever.

193
00:17:08,936 --> 00:17:10,499
If we don't figure this out,

194
00:17:10,634 --> 00:17:12,436
she's gonna go a lot farther
than the bridge.

195
00:17:12,572 --> 00:17:14,303
If they find her, we're never
gonna see her again.

196
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,808
We got to protect her.
That's our job.

197
00:17:15,943 --> 00:17:17,136
That's what we're gonna do.

198
00:17:17,271 --> 00:17:18,810
Protect her how?

199
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:20,971
By locking her inside?

200
00:17:22,017 --> 00:17:24,240
<i>She's got questions.</i>

201
00:17:25,243 --> 00:17:27,153
<i>You know,</i>
<i>questions we can't answer.</i>

202
00:17:29,122 --> 00:17:30,981
<i>She wants to know who she is.</i>

203
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,690
<i>Who Charlotte Lockwood was.</i>

204
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,796
Tracked Grady to his house.

205
00:17:43,931 --> 00:17:47,998
You were right--
the raptor's got a juvenile.

206
00:17:49,143 --> 00:17:51,375
But listen,
there's something else.

207
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:54,543
I found that girl
you've been after.

208
00:18:09,158 --> 00:18:10,658
Here you go.

209
00:19:23,134 --> 00:19:24,462
Thanks for coming.

210
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:26,965
Wasn't sure who to call.

211
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,840
Fish and Wildlife
didn't even want to see it

212
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:30,441
if it wasn't a dinosaur.

213
00:19:30,576 --> 00:19:32,608
Yeah, well,
they get all the attention.

214
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:34,341
You guys want to vary
the sampling plots

215
00:19:34,476 --> 00:19:35,773
a hundred yards each?

216
00:19:35,908 --> 00:19:38,249
-These your students?
-Yeah.

217
00:19:38,384 --> 00:19:39,846
We've been looking
into the impact

218
00:19:39,981 --> 00:19:41,954
of industrial farming
on the environment,

219
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,420
so this is right up our alley.

220
00:19:44,556 --> 00:19:47,260
They hit 60 fields
in the county.

221
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,289
Have you seen anything
like this before?

222
00:19:49,424 --> 00:19:51,487
No. Not like this.

223
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:54,599
They've been leaving degraded
fields all across the Midwest.

224
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,967
First, these big companies
try to kill off all the insects.

225
00:19:58,102 --> 00:19:59,965
Now this.

226
00:20:10,016 --> 00:20:11,449
Is that your land?

227
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:12,776
FARMER PERÃ‰-
That's the Bennetts' corn.

228
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,220
The locusts didn't eat that.

229
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,654
You plant the same seed
as the Bennetts?

230
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,318
No.

231
00:20:18,454 --> 00:20:20,260
We are independent.

232
00:20:21,457 --> 00:20:23,527
They use Biosyn seed.

233
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,630
Yeah, I bet they do.

234
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:30,560
You say you caught a live one?

235
00:20:40,181 --> 00:20:42,315
Okay. Let her down slow.

236
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:46,781
-Got it?
-Yeah. Easy.

237
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:55,028
Why do we dig?

238
00:20:55,163 --> 00:20:58,229
'Cause paleontology is science,

239
00:20:58,364 --> 00:21:00,892
and science is about the truth,

240
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:02,899
and there is truth
in these rocks.

241
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:04,337
Grant!

242
00:21:06,735 --> 00:21:08,236
You're gonna want to see this.

243
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,212
Ellie Sattler.

244
00:21:23,814 --> 00:21:25,682
Alan Grant.

245
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,521
You look the same.

246
00:21:27,657 --> 00:21:29,523
-Oh.

247
00:21:29,658 --> 00:21:32,596
And this place-- it's so...

248
00:21:33,593 --> 00:21:35,698
...so, uh, you.

249
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,899
I'm sorry, I...

250
00:21:39,035 --> 00:21:41,066
If I'd known you were coming,
I would've...

251
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,069
Uh...

252
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,072
Can I get you something?
A beer or...

253
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:52,074
Um, well, maybe not
at- 00 a.m.

254
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,951
But iced tea or...

255
00:21:54,086 --> 00:21:55,481
Tea. Yeah.

256
00:21:55,617 --> 00:21:57,082
Tea. I can do that.

257
00:21:58,723 --> 00:22:00,756
Saw a lot of tourists
on the way in.

258
00:22:01,891 --> 00:22:04,220
Well, the funding's dried up,
so...

259
00:22:04,355 --> 00:22:05,898
somebody's got to pay
for all this.

260
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,368
Right. Thank you.

261
00:22:10,131 --> 00:22:12,433
I read your articles
about soil science

262
00:22:12,569 --> 00:22:14,006
and regenerative farming.

263
00:22:14,142 --> 00:22:16,167
-It was great.
-Thanks.

264
00:22:16,303 --> 00:22:18,636
Gave me grounds for some hope,
for a change.

265
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,008
How are your kids?

266
00:22:20,144 --> 00:22:21,814
Mm.

267
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:23,744
Amazing. Grown.

268
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,743
It's shocking.
They're both in college.

269
00:22:25,878 --> 00:22:27,248
Can you believe that?

270
00:22:27,383 --> 00:22:28,883
And Mark?

271
00:22:30,782 --> 00:22:32,757
It's over.

272
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:34,757
Oh.

273
00:22:35,955 --> 00:22:37,654
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

274
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:39,260
It's okay.

275
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:40,798
I'm back to me.

276
00:22:40,934 --> 00:22:42,191
My work.

277
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,266
-You know, it's...
-That's great.

278
00:22:44,401 --> 00:22:45,861
It's good. It is.

279
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:47,433
I'm alone at last.

280
00:22:47,568 --> 00:22:48,934
Exciting times.

281
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:51,540
Yeah, I'm living
the Alan Grant life.

282
00:22:51,675 --> 00:22:53,274
-It's just...
-Can be lonely.

283
00:22:53,409 --> 00:22:54,909
...so free.

284
00:22:57,611 --> 00:22:59,412
Ellie...

285
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:04,787
You didn't come out all this way
just to catch up, now, did you?

286
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,294
Well, it's a locust.

287
00:23:10,429 --> 00:23:13,628
Mandibles, wings, thorax, but...

288
00:23:13,763 --> 00:23:15,730
God, the size of it is massive.

289
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,472
It has genes that have been
extinct since the Cretaceous,

290
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:22,634
and swarms of them
are decimating crops

291
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:24,240
from Iowa to Texas.

292
00:23:24,375 --> 00:23:26,369
Terrifying, right?

293
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,911
Started as a few hundred.

294
00:23:29,046 --> 00:23:31,016
There could be millions
by the end of the summer.

295
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:32,716
If they keep going,

296
00:23:32,852 --> 00:23:35,519
there will be no grain
to feed chickens, cattle.

297
00:23:35,655 --> 00:23:37,823
The entire food chain
would collapse.

298
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:42,122
Well, it's clearly designed,
but why would anyone do that?

299
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:46,996
None of the crops they're eating
are Biosyn seed.

300
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:48,696
Biosyn.

301
00:23:48,831 --> 00:23:50,334
You're saying Biosyn made this.

302
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,330
I mean, it would not shock me

303
00:23:52,466 --> 00:23:54,701
that they want to control
the world's food supply.

304
00:23:54,836 --> 00:23:57,208
Not before a few million starve.

305
00:23:57,344 --> 00:23:58,742
Yeah, what is that saying?

306
00:23:58,877 --> 00:24:01,605
Uh, we're three meals away
from anarchy?

307
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,408
If we don't stop them, you can
pick your last three meals.

308
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:08,878
So why are you
bringing it to me?

309
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,719
I need concrete evidence

310
00:24:10,855 --> 00:24:12,786
Biosyn's responsible
for all this.

311
00:24:12,921 --> 00:24:14,559
I need to go to their sanctuary

312
00:24:14,695 --> 00:24:17,156
and get DNA
from another locust there.

313
00:24:18,529 --> 00:24:21,097
But I need a witness.

314
00:24:21,232 --> 00:24:22,492
Alan.

315
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,599
You command respect.
People believe you.

316
00:24:25,734 --> 00:24:27,703
Ellie.

317
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,536
You know why I'm here?
It's quiet.

318
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:31,076
I'm done with all that.

319
00:24:31,212 --> 00:24:33,079
Are you? Okay.

320
00:24:33,214 --> 00:24:34,939
Well, I'm sorry, Alan.

321
00:24:35,074 --> 00:24:36,905
Nobody gets that luxury anymore.

322
00:24:37,041 --> 00:24:38,578
Not even you.

323
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:40,580
And you know what?

324
00:24:40,716 --> 00:24:42,252
You're the one I trust.

325
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:50,493
This Biosyn sanctuary is what,
a hundred miles from anywhere?

326
00:24:50,629 --> 00:24:51,997
How do you even get in there?

327
00:24:52,132 --> 00:24:53,562
I got an invite.

328
00:24:53,697 --> 00:24:55,898
From their in-house philosopher.

329
00:24:56,931 --> 00:24:58,162
Seems there's a lot of money

330
00:24:58,298 --> 00:25:00,234
in being a chaotician
these days.

331
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:03,599
And he just happened to invite
you out of the blue, huh?

332
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,141
He said there were things
I'd want to see.

333
00:25:06,277 --> 00:25:07,437
Uh-huh.

334
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,818
You coming or what?

335
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,427
- Every animal captured
on the mainland

336
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,836
comes through here
before shipping out

337
00:25:32,971 --> 00:25:34,273
to Biosyn's sanctuary
in the Dolomites.

338
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:36,035
We give them medical attention

339
00:25:36,171 --> 00:25:38,275
and make sure
they leave healthy.

340
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,279
So much security.

341
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,010
Those are just the ones you see.

342
00:25:42,145 --> 00:25:44,441
A lot of shady types out there
want these guys.

343
00:25:46,982 --> 00:25:48,677
Your plane's just fueling up.

344
00:25:49,813 --> 00:25:52,216
Biosyn's a tough invite.
You guys must know somebody.

345
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,286
-Do you mind if I...?
-Of course.

346
00:25:55,953 --> 00:25:57,689
Hello.

347
00:25:57,824 --> 00:25:59,064
You see me?

348
00:25:59,199 --> 00:26:00,564
Follow me.

349
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:02,362
We rescued these guys

350
00:26:02,498 --> 00:26:04,335
from an illegal breeding farm
in Nevada a few weeks ago.

351
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:06,566
Shut the whole place down.

352
00:26:06,702 --> 00:26:07,999
Anonymous tip.

353
00:26:08,135 --> 00:26:09,569
Good girl.

354
00:26:09,704 --> 00:26:11,837
Yes. Yes.

355
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:13,740
Alan.

356
00:26:13,876 --> 00:26:15,945
You never get used to it.

357
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,579
-Take care.
-Thank you.

358
00:26:18,715 --> 00:26:20,213
-Bye.
-Okay.

359
00:26:21,188 --> 00:26:23,216
â™ª â™ª

360
00:26:35,697 --> 00:26:37,736
â™ª â™ª

361
00:26:56,519 --> 00:26:57,848
Hey.

362
00:26:59,558 --> 00:27:01,727
You look just like Blue.

363
00:27:04,828 --> 00:27:06,693
-This?

364
00:27:06,829 --> 00:27:08,767
You want to try it?

365
00:27:09,763 --> 00:27:10,901
Okay.

366
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,504
Huh.

367
00:27:24,585 --> 00:27:26,543
Maisie, don't move.

368
00:27:30,356 --> 00:27:31,453
Hey, girl.

369
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:33,790
Staying out of trouble?

370
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:36,161
She had a baby.
That's impossible.

371
00:27:38,693 --> 00:27:39,994
Back up.

372
00:27:40,129 --> 00:27:41,896
She won't hurt us, right?

373
00:27:42,031 --> 00:27:43,432
Oh, you're damn right she will.

374
00:27:43,568 --> 00:27:45,001
Just breathe.

375
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,802
If you don't,
she'll think you're scared.

376
00:27:46,937 --> 00:27:48,565
-I am scared.

377
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,403
- Nah. She doesn't
need to know that.

378
00:27:58,445 --> 00:28:00,181
Her nest has got to be nearby.

379
00:28:00,316 --> 00:28:02,419
-Maisie, get inside.
-I'm coming with you.

380
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,888
What did I just say?

381
00:28:13,498 --> 00:28:14,966
We got to move.

382
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:16,659
WOMAN
Not yet. We need the girl.

383
00:28:18,836 --> 00:28:19,862
Hey, what's up?

384
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,136
Oh.

385
00:28:24,278 --> 00:28:27,175
Maisie? Maisie.

386
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:33,208
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

387
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:34,385
Where are you going?

388
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:35,618
You can't keep me here.

389
00:28:35,753 --> 00:28:36,954
You're not my mother.

390
00:28:42,793 --> 00:28:45,160
She's leaving the house.

391
00:29:11,892 --> 00:29:13,423
-Tie it down!
-Come on, let's go.

392
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,558
-Let's get out of here!

393
00:29:39,177 --> 00:29:40,820
Who are you?

394
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,693
â™ª â™ª

395
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,601
Claire!

396
00:30:04,612 --> 00:30:06,271
-They found her.
-What?

397
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:07,743
-Who are they?
-Poachers.

398
00:30:07,878 --> 00:30:09,305
I've seen 'em around.

399
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,906
Leader's a real shit heel.

400
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,543
He must have recognized me,
followed me here.

401
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,144
-Where is she?
-Go get the truck.

402
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,889
Oh, my God.

403
00:30:19,623 --> 00:30:21,251
Oh, God.

404
00:30:23,092 --> 00:30:24,987
-Owen.

405
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:26,826
Hey. No.

406
00:30:30,901 --> 00:30:32,597
They took her kid, too.

407
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:38,905
I am gonna get her back.

408
00:30:39,041 --> 00:30:40,675
I promise you that.

409
00:30:50,918 --> 00:30:52,281
Come on.

410
00:30:52,417 --> 00:30:53,985
I know who to call.

411
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,159
â™ª â™ª

412
00:31:08,903 --> 00:31:11,275
WOMAN
No! Please, please! No, no!

413
00:31:12,845 --> 00:31:14,607
This year, man. What's next?

414
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:18,042
Historically, uh, darkness,
blood, rain of fire.

415
00:31:18,178 --> 00:31:19,645
I think frogs.

416
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,350
We're not gonna be around
for much longer anyway.

417
00:31:21,486 --> 00:31:22,952
These locusts in Nebraska
are about to wrap it up.

418
00:31:23,087 --> 00:31:24,518
They're eating the corn, wheat.

419
00:31:24,653 --> 00:31:26,515
Basically all of our food
and our food's food.

420
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:28,859
So we can say goodbye to this.

421
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:33,862
-Hello?
-- Franklin, it's me.

422
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:35,330
-You at work?
-Okay.

423
00:31:35,465 --> 00:31:37,330
You're kind of a subject
of interest around here,

424
00:31:37,466 --> 00:31:38,965
so I can't really
be talking to you.

425
00:31:39,101 --> 00:31:40,166
Come on, I'm in trouble.

426
00:31:40,301 --> 00:31:41,640
I really need your help, please.

427
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,306
Yeah, and I could lose my job,

428
00:31:43,442 --> 00:31:44,838
and you know I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

429
00:31:44,974 --> 00:31:46,176
We're outside.

430
00:31:48,772 --> 00:31:50,114
Let me talk to him.

431
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:54,683
That him?

432
00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:56,048
That's him.

433
00:31:56,184 --> 00:31:58,314
Name's Rainn Delacourt.

434
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,919
Real piece of work.

435
00:32:00,054 --> 00:32:01,455
What'd he take?

436
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:04,594
Something we care about
very much.

437
00:32:04,729 --> 00:32:06,494
Oh, shit.

438
00:32:06,629 --> 00:32:08,362
I told you somebody
would come looking for her.

439
00:32:08,498 --> 00:32:10,201
You can't just take
a person, Claire.

440
00:32:10,336 --> 00:32:12,499
-I had no choice.
-Not in the eyes of the law.

441
00:32:12,634 --> 00:32:15,304
This guy is not the law.
Tell us how to find him.

442
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,706
Where'd you guys call me from?

443
00:32:19,743 --> 00:32:22,780
We have a man on the inside
of Delacourt's operation.

444
00:32:22,915 --> 00:32:24,179
There's an exchange in Malta

445
00:32:24,315 --> 00:32:25,517
sometime tomorrow--
cash for cargo.

446
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:27,144
Was she with him?

447
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:31,116
There's no mention, but we have
people on the ground already.

448
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:32,584
One of 'em you know.

449
00:32:32,719 --> 00:32:33,955
A lot of us got recruited
by the CIA

450
00:32:34,091 --> 00:32:35,357
after the park went down.

451
00:32:36,995 --> 00:32:38,657
Barry's French intelligence now.

452
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,966
I need to talk to him.

453
00:32:42,102 --> 00:32:43,969
You can't just call him.
He's deep cover.

454
00:32:44,104 --> 00:32:45,797
Look, once we make
the bust in Malta,

455
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:48,099
our guys will see if Delacourt
knows where she is.

456
00:32:48,234 --> 00:32:49,901
Our guys.

457
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:51,406
Not you.

458
00:32:51,541 --> 00:32:54,370
Promise me you won't go in there
with your vest

459
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:56,015
and mess everything up.

460
00:32:57,014 --> 00:32:58,248
Why would I do that?

461
00:32:59,548 --> 00:33:02,745
Look, you guys
are both crazy, but...

462
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,415
you seem like
you're good parents

463
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,217
or whatever you're trying to be.

464
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,390
She's lucky to have you.

465
00:33:09,796 --> 00:33:12,130
Don't get killed, okay?

466
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:18,400
â™ª â™ª

467
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:32,076
Think we're almost there.

468
00:33:32,211 --> 00:33:33,448
Yeah.

469
00:33:47,097 --> 00:33:48,925
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.

470
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,668
-Ramsay Cole, communications.
-Oh, hey.

471
00:33:50,804 --> 00:33:52,102
Uh, I have to warn you,

472
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,699
everyone's so excited
to have you.

473
00:33:53,834 --> 00:33:56,131
You guys are absolute legends
around here.

474
00:33:56,266 --> 00:33:58,610
Mm, you must be confusing us
with somebody else.

475
00:33:58,746 --> 00:34:00,278
You know, it's great

476
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,206
that you guys are still
so close with Dr. Malcolm.

477
00:34:02,341 --> 00:34:05,150
I mean, sometimes you meet your
heroes and they disappoint you,

478
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:07,315
but he's exactly the way
you'd want him to be.

479
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,710
I mean,
such motility of thought.

480
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,054
-It's incredible.
-Yeah.

481
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:11,784
How much time
have you spent with him?

482
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:14,352
Uh, well,
I know that was sarcastic,

483
00:34:14,488 --> 00:34:15,727
but honestly, not enough.

484
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:16,895
Oh, please, after you.

485
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,222
-Oh.
-And watch your head.

486
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:20,429
â™ª â™ª

487
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,536
- So, Biosyn bought this
land for the amber deposits

488
00:34:27,671 --> 00:34:29,505
back in the '90s,
but we've managed to turn it

489
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,010
into a safe haven
for about 20 displaced species.

490
00:34:32,146 --> 00:34:34,003
First generation came
from Sorna.

491
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:36,006
Most of the Nublar dinosaurs
are here, too.

492
00:34:36,142 --> 00:34:38,917
Took Fish and Wildlife
three years to catch the T. rex.

493
00:34:39,052 --> 00:34:41,520
-The...
-The T. rex is here?

494
00:34:41,655 --> 00:34:44,046
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

495
00:34:44,181 --> 00:34:46,888
Arrived just before you guys.

496
00:34:47,023 --> 00:34:49,656
â™ª â™ª

497
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:06,542
Aerial deterrent system active.

498
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:09,509
Restricted airspace
protects the airborne life.

499
00:35:09,645 --> 00:35:11,781
Keeps the pterosaurs
below 500 feet.

500
00:35:11,916 --> 00:35:13,152
Airborne?

501
00:35:15,087 --> 00:35:17,050
Is that<i> Dreadnoughtus?</i>

502
00:35:17,186 --> 00:35:18,817
What?

503
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:27,690
Beautiful, right?

504
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:29,728
The name means "fear nothing."

505
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:32,133
Well, I guess you know that.

506
00:35:32,268 --> 00:35:33,397
What do they graze on?

507
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:34,631
Hawthorn and fern.

508
00:35:34,766 --> 00:35:36,238
All indigenous-- nothing stocked

509
00:35:36,373 --> 00:35:38,102
except for the deer population.

510
00:35:38,237 --> 00:35:41,373
It's a great mezzanine species
for the apex predator.

511
00:35:41,508 --> 00:35:43,374
-Oh...
-Apex predator?

512
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,750
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

513
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:47,945
At least for now.

514
00:35:57,396 --> 00:36:00,429
Uh, you don't let people
in there, right?

515
00:36:00,565 --> 00:36:02,761
Uh, no, our-our research...

516
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:04,593
Our research outposts
are connected

517
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:05,760
completely underground.

518
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,405
If we have to, we can just

519
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,573
herd the animals remotely
using a neuro-implant

520
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:12,743
that sends electrical signals
directly to the brain.

521
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:14,307
Like shocks?

522
00:36:14,443 --> 00:36:17,315
Uh, n-no, li-like signals.

523
00:36:17,451 --> 00:36:20,246
Doesn't it strike you
as a little bit, uh...

524
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:21,744
-Cruel?
-Cruel.

525
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:23,420
Do you know how much voltage

526
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,082
was in the electric fences
at Jurassic Park?

527
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:27,923
Yeah.

528
00:36:28,058 --> 00:36:30,086
â™ª â™ª

529
00:36:34,161 --> 00:36:36,093
WOMAN Please join
Dr. Ian Malcolm at noon

530
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:38,826
in the lecture hall for
"The Ethics of Genetic Power."

531
00:36:38,962 --> 00:36:40,831
God, everyone's so young.

532
00:36:40,967 --> 00:36:42,503
Oh, well, it is part
of our ethos

533
00:36:42,638 --> 00:36:44,300
to attract the best
and brightest.

534
00:36:44,436 --> 00:36:46,278
Doctors.

535
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:50,113
Respected, renowned
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant.

536
00:36:50,248 --> 00:36:52,347
Hi. I'm... Wow, this is big.

537
00:36:52,482 --> 00:36:54,646
-I'm-I'm Lewis.
-Dodgson. Yeah.

538
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,051
-Hi.
-You're Lewis Dodgson?

539
00:36:56,187 --> 00:36:57,487
I am. How do you do?

540
00:36:57,622 --> 00:36:59,619
We didn't expect
to actually see you here.

541
00:36:59,754 --> 00:37:00,883
Oh, well, I wouldn't be
anywhere else.

542
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:03,219
-Would you?
-No.

543
00:37:03,354 --> 00:37:05,854
I mean, the people you see here
are changing the world.

544
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:07,194
Would you mind if we, um...

545
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:09,025
-Uh...
-Oh.

546
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,027
Just to...
It would mean a lot. If...

547
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,502
-Do you want to, um...

548
00:37:12,637 --> 00:37:14,135
-Oh, great. Thank you so much.
-Oh, uh...

549
00:37:15,639 --> 00:37:17,201
Th-That's good.
That's good. Thanks.

550
00:37:17,337 --> 00:37:21,809
So, you are going to see
some remarkable things today.

551
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:25,379
We are unlocking
the true power of the genome.

552
00:37:25,515 --> 00:37:27,018
We're this close. Believe me.

553
00:37:27,153 --> 00:37:28,876
You'll make a fortune with that.

554
00:37:29,012 --> 00:37:31,022
No, it's not about money.

555
00:37:31,157 --> 00:37:32,653
No, we've already identified

556
00:37:32,788 --> 00:37:34,350
dozens of applications
for paleo-DNA.

557
00:37:34,485 --> 00:37:38,096
We're talking about cancer,
Alzheimer's, autoimmune.

558
00:37:38,231 --> 00:37:39,988
We will be saving lives, but...

559
00:37:40,123 --> 00:37:41,664
-I bet.

560
00:37:41,799 --> 00:37:44,033
Um, anyway, I wish I could
take you around myself,

561
00:37:44,169 --> 00:37:45,866
but, uh, it's, uh...

562
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:49,107
So, you're in more-than-capable
hands with Ramsay.

563
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:52,275
He's basically a... a young me,

564
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:55,841
only smarter and, uh, taller...

565
00:37:55,976 --> 00:37:58,712
-Do you have food?

566
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:01,177
-Like, one of my bars?
-Pardon? Um...

567
00:38:01,312 --> 00:38:03,452
No, never mind.
Uh, uh, I'll find something.

568
00:38:03,588 --> 00:38:05,550
So, uh, I want to do
more of this,

569
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:07,785
um, later on if we, um...

570
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,853
Oh, we booked you a private pod

571
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,558
-for the trip out, so...
-Right.

572
00:38:11,693 --> 00:38:12,923
It's beautiful. You'll love it.

573
00:38:13,059 --> 00:38:14,464
Through the caverns
and everything.

574
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,027
Uh, you better hurry.
Malcolm's on.

575
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:18,199
He's a bit of a contrarian,
but I like him.

576
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:19,562
He keeps us on our toes.

577
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:20,898
Anyway...

578
00:38:21,033 --> 00:38:23,001
Thank you for being here.
It's...

579
00:38:25,376 --> 00:38:27,742
Okay, um, follow me, please.

580
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:31,109
What?

581
00:38:31,244 --> 00:38:36,485
Human beings have no more right
to safety or liberty

582
00:38:36,621 --> 00:38:39,721
than any other creature
on this planet.

583
00:38:41,462 --> 00:38:46,095
We not only lack dominion
over nature,

584
00:38:46,231 --> 00:38:48,224
we're subordinate to it.

585
00:38:49,234 --> 00:38:50,898
And now here we are

586
00:38:51,033 --> 00:38:54,430
with the opportunity to
rewrite life at our fingertips.

587
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:57,609
And just like nuclear power,
nobody knew what to expect

588
00:38:57,745 --> 00:39:01,012
with genetic engineering,
but they pressed the button

589
00:39:01,148 --> 00:39:03,972
and hoped for the best...

590
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:06,748
just like you are doing now.

591
00:39:07,888 --> 00:39:10,114
Yep. You.

592
00:39:11,417 --> 00:39:16,825
You control the future
of our survival on planet Earth.

593
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,696
According to you,
the solution is genetic power.

594
00:39:19,831 --> 00:39:23,132
But that same power could
devastate the food supply,

595
00:39:23,268 --> 00:39:25,533
create new diseases,

596
00:39:25,668 --> 00:39:27,831
alter the climate even further.

597
00:39:27,967 --> 00:39:31,705
Unforeseen consequences occur.

598
00:39:31,841 --> 00:39:37,075
And every time,
every single time...

599
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:40,717
...we all act surprised?

600
00:39:40,852 --> 00:39:43,719
Because deep down,
I don't think that any of us

601
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:46,825
actually believe
that these dangers are real.

602
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:57,996
In order to instigate
revolutionary change,

603
00:39:58,132 --> 00:40:03,875
we must transform
human consciousness.

604
00:40:11,613 --> 00:40:12,878
-Mayam?
-Mm-hmm.

605
00:40:13,014 --> 00:40:14,678
-- Dr. Malcolm?
-Very good.

606
00:40:14,814 --> 00:40:16,347
There-there you go.

607
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,379
Hey, I don't want to be rude
to my friends. Thank you.

608
00:40:18,515 --> 00:40:20,584
Catch me on my way out.
Thanks, everybody.

609
00:40:20,719 --> 00:40:22,017
Look at you,

610
00:40:22,152 --> 00:40:25,887
and look at me, and look at you.

611
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:27,660
Wow, this is so trippy.

612
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:29,893
You look like you're doing well.

613
00:40:30,028 --> 00:40:31,426
Well, I got five kids, you know,

614
00:40:31,561 --> 00:40:33,433
whom I adore
more than life itself, so...

615
00:40:33,569 --> 00:40:34,931
uh, expenses add up.

616
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:37,405
You, Alan? Are you... are you...

617
00:40:37,541 --> 00:40:39,502
You have any family or...?

618
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:40,574
No.

619
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,007
So, uh, I need to talk to you.

620
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:44,613
Yeah, I need to talk
to you, too.

621
00:40:44,749 --> 00:40:47,079
-Privately.
-Do you two talk a lot?

622
00:40:47,214 --> 00:40:49,354
-Uh, he slid into my DMs.
-He did what?

623
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,554
-It's urgent, Ian.
-What did you do?

624
00:40:51,689 --> 00:40:53,284
"Seven minutes to midnight"
stuff.

625
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:55,724
Uh, the Doomsday Clock
might be about out of time,

626
00:40:55,859 --> 00:40:58,361
but as they say,
it's always darkest

627
00:40:58,496 --> 00:41:01,129
just before eternal nothingness.

628
00:41:01,264 --> 00:41:02,666
What?

629
00:41:04,704 --> 00:41:07,867
- Locusts,
altered with Cretaceous-era DNA.

630
00:41:08,002 --> 00:41:09,399
Yeah, that's not my field.

631
00:41:09,534 --> 00:41:11,435
Yeah, but if these things
continue to multiply,

632
00:41:11,571 --> 00:41:14,243
we're talking about cascading
system-wide effects, Ian.

633
00:41:14,379 --> 00:41:15,939
Gosh, that's a drag.

634
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:18,045
What is the matter with you?

635
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,976
Why? Is there something special
you want me to do?

636
00:41:20,111 --> 00:41:21,309
Yeah, how about give a damn?

637
00:41:21,445 --> 00:41:22,785
You know far too much
not to care.

638
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,481
Hey, I-I gave my opinion
robustly for years.

639
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:28,484
As expected,
the sum of our human endeavors

640
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:31,729
has led to our annihilation,
and the only play now

641
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,424
is to take the time
that we have left and, uh,

642
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:36,631
you know, just like
we always do, squander it.

643
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:39,798
Honestly, Ian, that's bullshit.

644
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:42,066
Can I offer you guys some joe?

645
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:45,836
Uh, Tyler, please,
two cappuccinos.

646
00:41:45,972 --> 00:41:47,670
I don't want a cappuccino.

647
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,405
Uh, well, I could do, like,
a cortado or, like, macchiato.

648
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,282
Trust me, it's real tough,
that jet lag.

649
00:41:51,418 --> 00:41:52,448
It's gonna perk you right up.

650
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:58,750
The locusts are part
of a larger project

651
00:41:58,885 --> 00:42:00,489
called Hexapod Allies.

652
00:42:00,624 --> 00:42:02,020
You're right about their intent.

653
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:04,357
I started hearing rumors
six weeks ago.

654
00:42:04,493 --> 00:42:06,693
I read your piece on decadence
and put two and two together.

655
00:42:06,828 --> 00:42:08,359
I was not raising my voice.

656
00:42:08,494 --> 00:42:09,964
You're beginning to.
It's crescendoing, isn't it?

657
00:42:10,099 --> 00:42:11,793
They're proliferating wildly.

658
00:42:11,928 --> 00:42:13,804
They're lasting three, four
times longer than they should.

659
00:42:13,939 --> 00:42:16,031
And all my models
are pointing toward a global

660
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:17,637
ecological collapse, Ian.

661
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,334
Downstairs, sublevel six.

662
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,311
That's where they keep
the locusts.

663
00:42:21,447 --> 00:42:23,374
Look for a lab marked L4.

664
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,276
But wait, how are we ever
gonna get down there?

665
00:42:25,412 --> 00:42:26,979
-Hey, this looks so silky.

666
00:42:27,115 --> 00:42:28,683
May I touch this blouse,
by any chance?

667
00:42:28,818 --> 00:42:30,348
-Sure.
-You know what it is?

668
00:42:30,484 --> 00:42:32,048
-Don't tell... Don't tell me.
-You won't know it.

669
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:34,121
This is sustainable bamboo.

670
00:42:34,256 --> 00:42:36,022
-It is sustainable bamboo.
-That's why I said it.

671
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,695
-How did you know that?
-I just know it.

672
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:39,158
-Yeah, it's amazing.
-- I've got cumin.

673
00:42:39,293 --> 00:42:40,698
-It's very amazing.
-I've got cinnamon.

674
00:42:40,834 --> 00:42:42,225
I've got allspice,
which is not very popular.

675
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,701
-I've got five-spice.
-Doctor.

676
00:42:43,837 --> 00:42:44,997
- Um, if you're into
that kind of feel.

677
00:42:45,133 --> 00:42:47,867
-Um, and let's talk milks.
-Yeah.

678
00:42:48,002 --> 00:42:49,898
Okay. Soy milk, yes?

679
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,836
-- No.
-What just happened?

680
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,647
We're in.

681
00:42:57,612 --> 00:42:59,651
â™ª â™ª

682
00:43:09,191 --> 00:43:12,059
Sublevel six. Restricted.

683
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,738
- Lewis,
you're not listening to me.

684
00:43:20,873 --> 00:43:22,703
The locusts' prehistoric DNA
has made them

685
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:24,666
stronger than they should be.

686
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:27,239
They're multiplying like crazy,
and they're not dying.

687
00:43:27,374 --> 00:43:28,773
What part of this
don't you understand?

688
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,107
Oh, I do understand.

689
00:43:30,242 --> 00:43:31,947
This is gonna be
a global famine.

690
00:43:32,082 --> 00:43:33,784
Hey, hey, we can't
anticipate everything.

691
00:43:33,919 --> 00:43:36,386
We need to eradicate
the ones we released.

692
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:38,216
-What?
-All of them.

693
00:43:38,352 --> 00:43:40,458
-No. No. Henry.
-Like... like, yesterday.

694
00:43:40,593 --> 00:43:42,060
We don't want to cause a panic.

695
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:43,788
We want control.

696
00:43:43,924 --> 00:43:46,060
There is no such thing.

697
00:43:58,437 --> 00:44:01,642
When we're afraid,
what do we do?

698
00:44:01,778 --> 00:44:03,577
What have we done before?

699
00:44:03,712 --> 00:44:06,448
We follow through.

700
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:08,316
That's what we do.

701
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:09,919
Right?

702
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:13,615
Right.

703
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,887
We found the girl.

704
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,463
She's en route.

705
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:21,799
-Cost me a fortune.
-What?

706
00:44:21,934 --> 00:44:24,159
-Wait, you found her?
-Yeah, found them both.

707
00:44:24,295 --> 00:44:26,603
Her and the little raptor.

708
00:44:26,738 --> 00:44:29,137
Blue reproduced all on her own.

709
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,133
Just like you said.
You're so smart, Henry.

710
00:44:34,579 --> 00:44:36,847
That's why this works.

711
00:44:36,982 --> 00:44:39,076
You understand the value
of these creatures.

712
00:44:39,211 --> 00:44:40,618
You always have. I do, too.

713
00:44:40,754 --> 00:44:42,982
And we don't stop
because a, what,

714
00:44:43,117 --> 00:44:44,723
little side project went south?

715
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:50,021
Hey. If they trace
the locusts back to us,

716
00:44:50,156 --> 00:44:51,625
they come for the dinosaurs.

717
00:44:51,761 --> 00:44:53,292
All your work gone.

718
00:44:54,493 --> 00:44:57,263
Billions of dollars
in assets gone.

719
00:44:58,728 --> 00:45:01,432
Diamonds with no one
to mine them.

720
00:45:02,501 --> 00:45:04,633
You really think
she's the solution?

721
00:45:07,906 --> 00:45:09,771
Okay.

722
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:13,246
Everything involving the girl
goes through me, right?

723
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:16,781
Is she all right?

724
00:45:16,917 --> 00:45:18,119
She better be.

725
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:20,482
She's the most valuable

726
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:22,585
intellectual property
on the planet.

727
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,164
I said I'd call you.

728
00:45:34,299 --> 00:45:35,532
They land yet?

729
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:37,171
Second plane is incoming.

730
00:45:37,306 --> 00:45:38,540
Who said anything
about a second plane?

731
00:45:38,676 --> 00:45:39,972
We flew them separately.

732
00:45:40,107 --> 00:45:41,371
I'm not taking any chances.

733
00:45:41,507 --> 00:45:43,813
And we'll need payment
before delivery.

734
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,916
I didn't like
what happened last time.

735
00:45:46,051 --> 00:45:49,348
Okay. Okay, just...
call me when it's done.

736
00:45:52,215 --> 00:45:54,287
â™ª â™ª

737
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,898
You said I was going
someplace safe.

738
00:46:01,894 --> 00:46:03,026
You are.

739
00:46:10,335 --> 00:46:11,733
Walk to the car.

740
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:15,242
-No.
-It's not a choice.

741
00:46:28,388 --> 00:46:31,425
50 grand to fly
one little raptor.

742
00:46:31,561 --> 00:46:33,491
Not bad.

743
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:39,728
What's with the girl?

744
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:44,502
-Not your problem.

745
00:46:52,347 --> 00:46:54,776
-Pleasure doing business.

746
00:46:57,757 --> 00:46:59,616
We're ready. Let's go.

747
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,096
Owen.

748
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:14,302
-Hi, Claire.
-Mm.

749
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:17,071
I thought you would've chosen
a quieter line of work.

750
00:47:17,207 --> 00:47:18,806
I tried.
My cousin and I opened a cafÃ©.

751
00:47:18,941 --> 00:47:20,803
I lasted three weeks.

752
00:47:20,938 --> 00:47:23,476
The way the world is headed,
it's hard to look away.

753
00:47:23,611 --> 00:47:26,412
<i>Delacourt was hired</i>
<i>by Soyona Santos,</i>

754
00:47:26,547 --> 00:47:28,478
a broker in
the underground dinosaur trade.

755
00:47:28,614 --> 00:47:30,687
We don't have intel
on his cargo,

756
00:47:30,822 --> 00:47:32,647
but once they make the exchange,

757
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,425
we'll see what they know
about your girl.

758
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,850
You can listen in,

759
00:47:35,985 --> 00:47:37,656
but promise me
you will not make contact.

760
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,095
No.

761
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:42,658
<i>Ouais, c'est Ã§a.</i>

762
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,260
<i>There is a big</i>
<i>underground market</i>

763
00:47:44,396 --> 00:47:45,695
<i>for dinosaurs now--</i>

764
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:47,769
<i>Europe, Middle East,</i>
<i>northern Africa.</i>

765
00:47:47,905 --> 00:47:49,373
It all comes through here.

766
00:48:00,153 --> 00:48:02,685
Don't look at anyone.
Don't talk to anyone.

767
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,613
Just try to blend in.

768
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:56,535
Hey, still flying
for Santos, huh?

769
00:48:56,670 --> 00:48:58,772
-You must need money.
-What's it to you?

770
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:00,901
I've got cargo.

771
00:49:01,037 --> 00:49:03,712
Thousand kilos of dinosaur
to Palermo.

772
00:49:03,847 --> 00:49:06,045
I give you 2,000.

773
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:08,646
2,000? How much is there?

774
00:49:18,223 --> 00:49:19,958
You lost?

775
00:49:20,093 --> 00:49:21,560
You're American.

776
00:49:23,098 --> 00:49:24,395
That make us friends?

777
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,565
Listen, I just got here, and...

778
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,700
Oh, no, that was not
an invitation. Here.

779
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:34,078
Souvenir. Go back to the hotel.

780
00:49:34,213 --> 00:49:36,373
You know, throw some bath salts
in the bath.

781
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:38,912
This place-- not your vibe.

782
00:49:39,047 --> 00:49:40,914
Wait.

783
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:42,878
-Look...
-Claire.

784
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:46,487
Claire, I know this must
feel exotic,

785
00:49:46,622 --> 00:49:48,756
but if you mess with
the wrong person down here,

786
00:49:48,892 --> 00:49:49,889
you disappear.

787
00:49:50,024 --> 00:49:51,091
You feel me?

788
00:49:51,226 --> 00:49:54,098
-Good luck, okay?
-Wait.

789
00:49:56,935 --> 00:49:58,563
-Wait.
-What is this?

790
00:49:58,698 --> 00:50:00,664
-I need your help.
-I don't know you.

791
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,673
-I'm looking for someone.
-Don't do that.

792
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:04,933
She is all alone. Please.

793
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:13,084
-That your daughter?
-Yes.

794
00:50:15,811 --> 00:50:17,715
Sorry. I can't get involved.

795
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:29,633
â™ª â™ª

796
00:50:36,436 --> 00:50:37,707
Think I got him.

797
00:50:37,843 --> 00:50:39,066
Target on the move.

798
00:50:40,103 --> 00:50:42,175
That's our undercover agent
with him.

799
00:50:42,310 --> 00:50:44,179
Claire, he's headed underground.

800
00:50:44,314 --> 00:50:45,743
-See him?
-Yeah, I've got him.

801
00:50:47,853 --> 00:50:49,052
All right, let's go.

802
00:50:49,188 --> 00:50:50,483
AGENT
<i>Team four,</i>

803
00:50:50,619 --> 00:50:51,617
<i>need you to sweep</i>
<i>spreading south.</i>

804
00:50:55,988 --> 00:50:58,129
- All units,
take up bull's-eye position.

805
00:50:59,628 --> 00:51:02,028
This is Bravo One.
Primary target in sight.

806
00:51:02,164 --> 00:51:03,824
No sign of the girl.

807
00:51:03,959 --> 00:51:05,268
Alpha team, stand clear.

808
00:51:15,843 --> 00:51:19,916
My people say the raptor
arrived in good condition.

809
00:51:20,052 --> 00:51:22,047
You boys didn't cock this up.

810
00:51:22,182 --> 00:51:23,854
Color me amazed.

811
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,547
I do have another job for you.

812
00:51:25,683 --> 00:51:27,218
Short hop. Money's double.

813
00:51:27,353 --> 00:51:28,692
What's the cargo?

814
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:32,827
<i>Atrociraptors.</i>

815
00:51:32,963 --> 00:51:34,389
Thoroughbreds.

816
00:51:34,524 --> 00:51:35,731
Trained to kill.

817
00:51:35,866 --> 00:51:36,932
Kill who?

818
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:38,665
Whoever they're told.

819
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,529
Laser marks the target,
they attach to the scent,

820
00:51:40,665 --> 00:51:41,836
don't stop till it's dead.

821
00:51:41,971 --> 00:51:43,340
Inescapable.

822
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,568
Those idiots making hybrids
had it all wrong.

823
00:51:45,703 --> 00:51:47,711
You can't engineer loyalty.

824
00:51:47,847 --> 00:51:49,506
You have to nurture it.

825
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:51,846
50,000 to fly them to Riyadh.

826
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:54,013
In or out?

827
00:51:54,148 --> 00:51:56,044
She's not here.

828
00:51:59,925 --> 00:52:01,588
Where are we going?

829
00:52:02,586 --> 00:52:03,920
Almost there.

830
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,298
That's the drop. Let's go.

831
00:52:11,434 --> 00:52:13,565
-Weapons down!
-Eyes on 'em!

832
00:52:13,701 --> 00:52:15,037
-Hands in the air!
-Contact made!

833
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:17,466
Delacourt, on the floor now!

834
00:52:17,601 --> 00:52:18,701
Get on the ground!

835
00:52:18,837 --> 00:52:20,368
Delacourt! Stay with him!

836
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:21,610
Shit.

837
00:52:23,378 --> 00:52:24,705
Get that truck out of here!

838
00:52:32,688 --> 00:52:34,087
AGENT
We lost Delacourt!

839
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,962
This is Bravo One.

840
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,735
Truck is approaching
the underpass.

841
00:54:03,779 --> 00:54:05,408
-Come on!

842
00:54:20,395 --> 00:54:21,595
The girl, where is she?

843
00:54:21,731 --> 00:54:23,430
-Where did they take her?
-Get it off!

844
00:54:23,566 --> 00:54:25,233
-Where is she?
-I don't know!

845
00:54:25,368 --> 00:54:27,195
We handed her off to Santos.

846
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:29,399
I don't know where
they took her after that.

847
00:54:42,417 --> 00:54:44,188
Claire, it's Santos.

848
00:54:44,324 --> 00:54:46,017
-The woman in white.
-I'll find her.

849
00:54:46,153 --> 00:54:48,491
-Bravo team, watch your six.

850
00:54:49,693 --> 00:54:51,852
-- Hey, hey!

851
00:54:51,988 --> 00:54:53,720
-Hey!
-Hold it!

852
00:54:53,856 --> 00:54:55,556
Let them out.

853
00:54:55,691 --> 00:54:56,591
What?!

854
00:54:56,727 --> 00:54:58,600
You heard me.

855
00:55:23,422 --> 00:55:25,121
Merde.

856
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,646
OWEN
Claire, do you have her?

857
00:55:58,295 --> 00:55:59,625
We had some trouble.

858
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,529
-What kind?
-The parents.

859
00:56:01,665 --> 00:56:03,623
Grady and Dearing--
they're here.

860
00:56:07,601 --> 00:56:08,872
Can you take care of it?

861
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:10,700
Not for free.

862
00:56:10,836 --> 00:56:12,773
Well, do it.

863
00:56:20,817 --> 00:56:23,487
-Mama.

864
00:56:27,491 --> 00:56:29,057
Okay, okay, listen.

865
00:56:29,192 --> 00:56:30,786
No, no, no.

866
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,800
You don't use it on people.

867
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:47,002
Where's my daughter?

868
00:56:47,137 --> 00:56:49,409
She wasn't yours to begin with.

869
00:56:51,444 --> 00:56:53,209
Tell me.

870
00:56:54,612 --> 00:56:56,010
Biosyn.

871
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,050
They're taking her to Biosyn.

872
00:57:04,491 --> 00:57:06,523
You missed her.

873
00:57:06,658 --> 00:57:08,157
She's gone.

874
00:57:59,947 --> 00:58:01,550
-Take my hand. Come on.

875
00:58:32,283 --> 00:58:33,679
Hold on tight.

876
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:35,349
-What?

877
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:48,461
Do you remember how we used to
get the raptors in the truck?

878
00:58:48,597 --> 00:58:49,963
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

879
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:52,794
-You're up.
-No.

880
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:55,935
At the last minute, dive-roll.

881
00:58:56,070 --> 00:58:58,202
-I don't dive-roll.
-You'll be fine.

882
00:58:58,337 --> 00:59:00,303
-I never got the timing right.

883
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:03,005
Now?

884
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:04,780
Any minute. Any minute now.

885
00:59:05,778 --> 00:59:07,442
-Now?
-No.

886
00:59:09,648 --> 00:59:10,918
Now!

887
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:16,484
-Yeah. Yeah!

888
00:59:17,689 --> 00:59:18,858
Freeze.

889
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,504
I'm flying us out of here.

890
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:28,997
Tell me where
you want to be dropped.

891
00:59:29,133 --> 00:59:30,531
You ever flown to Biosyn?

892
00:59:32,175 --> 00:59:34,406
CLAIRE
Owen, they took her to Biosyn!

893
00:59:34,541 --> 00:59:36,677
-There's an airfield on the
north side of the island. -Go.

894
00:59:36,812 --> 00:59:38,247
You're under arrest.

895
00:59:38,383 --> 00:59:39,881
Stay where you are.

896
01:00:06,034 --> 01:00:07,909
Right!

897
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:13,743
Heads up!

898
01:01:20,384 --> 01:01:22,252
â™ª â™ª

899
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:39,594
â™ª â™ª

900
01:01:51,749 --> 01:01:53,139
We made a lot of enemies today.

901
01:01:53,275 --> 01:01:54,308
We got to go.

902
01:01:54,443 --> 01:01:55,786
-He'll be here.
-Uh-huh.

903
01:01:59,855 --> 01:02:01,858
Out of time, out of time.

904
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:05,257
There he is.

905
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:09,690
-Pull over.
-That's not how planes work.

906
01:02:16,034 --> 01:02:17,636
Open the back.

907
01:02:17,771 --> 01:02:19,810
â™ª â™ª

908
01:02:36,151 --> 01:02:37,388
Come on!

909
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:45,000
Hold on tight!

910
01:03:01,212 --> 01:03:03,678
Oh, sh...

911
01:03:10,362 --> 01:03:12,357
â™ª â™ª

912
01:03:14,191 --> 01:03:15,690
Still got it.

913
01:03:34,683 --> 01:03:36,880
Kayla Watts.

914
01:03:37,015 --> 01:03:38,713
You're welcome.

915
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:40,715
You don't look like
you fly for Biosyn.

916
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,152
I'm gonna take that
the way you meant it

917
01:03:42,287 --> 01:03:44,088
and not the way it sounded.

918
01:03:44,224 --> 01:03:45,661
I fly from whoever got a bag,

919
01:03:45,796 --> 01:03:47,256
but we'll call this one a favor.

920
01:03:47,392 --> 01:03:49,933
Those don't work. They broke.

921
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:52,793
I'll take y'all to Biosyn,

922
01:03:52,928 --> 01:03:54,798
but I can't promise
it won't be dangerous.

923
01:03:54,933 --> 01:03:57,699
You're willing to risk your
life for people you never met?

924
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:02,077
You want to ask questions,
or you want a ride?

925
01:04:05,111 --> 01:04:06,647
We'll take the ride.

926
01:04:13,882 --> 01:04:15,959
So, this is our habitat
development lab.

927
01:04:16,094 --> 01:04:18,487
A lot of exciting discoveries
as of late.

928
01:04:18,622 --> 01:04:19,958
We've brought back
numerous species

929
01:04:20,093 --> 01:04:21,359
in their purest form,

930
01:04:21,495 --> 01:04:23,599
and I mean complete,
untouched genomes.

931
01:04:23,735 --> 01:04:25,325
Like<i> Moros intrepidus.</i>

932
01:04:25,461 --> 01:04:27,095
-What?
-Yeah.

933
01:04:28,463 --> 01:04:29,933
Wow.

934
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,942
What about splicing DNA?

935
01:04:35,077 --> 01:04:36,837
You know, creating new species?

936
01:04:36,972 --> 01:04:39,377
Uh, no, Dr. Sattler,
we don't do that here.

937
01:04:39,512 --> 01:04:41,413
We like to think
we're more evolved.

938
01:04:46,288 --> 01:04:47,316
Okay, it looks like
we still have

939
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:48,450
some time left before your ride.

940
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,516
Uh, would you guys like to tour

941
01:04:50,652 --> 01:04:51,890
the facilities yourselves?

942
01:04:52,025 --> 01:04:54,287
Oh, uh, I mean...

943
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:56,128
uh, we could.

944
01:04:56,263 --> 01:04:58,135
-Yeah, why not?
-- Great.

945
01:04:58,270 --> 01:05:00,294
I'll meet you guys at
the hyperloop, station three,

946
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:02,533
in about 30 minutes.

947
01:05:02,668 --> 01:05:04,732
Elevators are down this hall.
Not-not those.

948
01:05:04,868 --> 01:05:06,570
Those lead you down
to the sublevels.

949
01:05:06,706 --> 01:05:08,645
You need special clearance
to get down there.

950
01:05:08,781 --> 01:05:11,146
-Oh, okay.
-30 minutes.

951
01:05:20,055 --> 01:05:21,556
Here.

952
01:05:21,691 --> 01:05:23,158
Take this.

953
01:05:24,663 --> 01:05:26,854
-Okay?
-Yep.

954
01:05:36,505 --> 01:05:39,500
I'm really sorry
that it had to happen this way.

955
01:05:39,635 --> 01:05:41,739
Yep, that's what kidnappers say.

956
01:05:43,379 --> 01:05:45,013
Claire should never
have hidden you away.

957
01:05:45,148 --> 01:05:47,380
You're way too important,
Maisie.

958
01:05:51,549 --> 01:05:53,518
You took her, too.

959
01:05:54,525 --> 01:05:56,191
Yeah.

960
01:05:56,326 --> 01:05:58,886
We needed her
to help us understand you.

961
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:05,860
Hey, Beta.

962
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,571
You okay?

963
01:06:08,707 --> 01:06:09,968
Did you say "Beta"?

964
01:06:10,103 --> 01:06:11,569
Is that her name?

965
01:06:12,567 --> 01:06:13,909
I gave it to her.

966
01:06:14,045 --> 01:06:15,641
Beta's pretty special.

967
01:06:15,777 --> 01:06:18,805
You know, when we made Blue,
we used monitor lizard DNA

968
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:21,546
to fill in the gaps
in her genome.

969
01:06:21,681 --> 01:06:24,449
Monitor lizards can reproduce
without a mate,

970
01:06:24,585 --> 01:06:28,456
so Beta and Blue
are genetically identical,

971
01:06:28,591 --> 01:06:30,394
and that's what they have
in common with you and...

972
01:06:30,529 --> 01:06:32,260
Charlotte.

973
01:06:34,724 --> 01:06:36,466
What do you know
about Charlotte?

974
01:06:36,601 --> 01:06:38,200
She died.

975
01:06:39,197 --> 01:06:40,598
A long time ago.

976
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:43,469
It broke my grandpa's heart.

977
01:06:45,237 --> 01:06:46,802
So he made me.

978
01:06:48,407 --> 01:06:50,542
No, Maisie, actually, he didn't.

979
01:06:53,048 --> 01:06:55,151
Charlotte made you.

980
01:06:57,952 --> 01:07:00,684
I'm so excited for everyone to
see what we've been doing here.

981
01:07:00,819 --> 01:07:03,956
There's new technology
being made, new science,

982
01:07:04,092 --> 01:07:05,859
like, every day almost.

983
01:07:05,995 --> 01:07:07,457
And it's great to be...

984
01:07:07,592 --> 01:07:09,125
it's great to be
in the center...

985
01:07:09,260 --> 01:07:10,826
center of that.

986
01:07:10,962 --> 01:07:15,197
- Charlotte lived
on Site B with all of us.

987
01:07:15,332 --> 01:07:17,530
Till the storm.

988
01:07:17,666 --> 01:07:18,999
She loved dinosaurs.

989
01:07:19,134 --> 01:07:20,433
HENRY
Charlotte, be careful.

990
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:21,968
Yeah, I will.

991
01:07:22,103 --> 01:07:23,971
She grew up around scientists.

992
01:07:24,981 --> 01:07:27,183
Then, eventually...

993
01:07:28,183 --> 01:07:29,845
...she became one herself.

994
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,945
A butterfly flew into
my office this morning.

995
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:34,318
They say tiny things
have huge impacts,

996
01:07:34,453 --> 01:07:36,318
and I agree wholeheartedly.

997
01:07:36,453 --> 01:07:38,458
She was brilliant.

998
01:07:40,129 --> 01:07:41,865
In ways that I'll never be.

999
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,462
In the metaphysics of identity,

1000
01:07:43,597 --> 01:07:45,729
can a replica
truly be the original?

1001
01:07:45,864 --> 01:07:49,502
And if it's possible,
what makes it so?

1002
01:07:54,504 --> 01:07:56,377
I've lost my pen.

1003
01:07:59,783 --> 01:08:01,012
Is that me?

1004
01:08:01,147 --> 01:08:03,382
Yeah.

1005
01:08:03,517 --> 01:08:05,185
Just like Blue,
Charlotte was able

1006
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:07,223
to have a child all by herself.

1007
01:08:08,324 --> 01:08:11,953
She created you
with her own DNA.

1008
01:08:12,963 --> 01:08:15,090
So I do have a mother.

1009
01:08:15,226 --> 01:08:18,362
Your grandfather didn't want
anyone to know the truth.

1010
01:08:18,498 --> 01:08:21,369
He was protecting her and you.

1011
01:08:22,368 --> 01:08:23,800
And we're the same?

1012
01:08:25,743 --> 01:08:27,001
You were.

1013
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:29,177
When you were a baby,
Charlotte started

1014
01:08:29,313 --> 01:08:31,175
to show symptoms
of a genetic disorder.

1015
01:08:31,311 --> 01:08:33,878
That's how she died.

1016
01:08:34,013 --> 01:08:37,445
She didn't know she had it
until after you were born.

1017
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,345
Do I have it, too?

1018
01:08:39,481 --> 01:08:40,680
No.

1019
01:08:40,815 --> 01:08:43,092
She changed your DNA.

1020
01:08:43,228 --> 01:08:45,894
She altered every cell
in your body

1021
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:48,264
to eradicate this disease.

1022
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,963
No one on earth has ever
known how to do that.

1023
01:08:51,099 --> 01:08:53,236
She fixed me.

1024
01:08:53,372 --> 01:08:56,063
Charlotte's discovery
is a part of you now.

1025
01:08:58,042 --> 01:09:01,407
Your DNA could change the world.

1026
01:09:01,542 --> 01:09:03,608
And I have to know
how she did it,

1027
01:09:03,743 --> 01:09:05,914
but I just can't
replicate her work.

1028
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:07,713
If I could just study you

1029
01:09:07,849 --> 01:09:11,111
and Beta, whose DNA
was never changed, I could...

1030
01:09:13,457 --> 01:09:16,287
...fix a terrible mistake
that I've made.

1031
01:09:16,422 --> 01:09:18,294
What kind of mistake?

1032
01:09:26,536 --> 01:09:28,931
Sublevel six. Restricted.

1033
01:09:33,276 --> 01:09:35,036
Thanks for coming.

1034
01:09:39,747 --> 01:09:41,443
ALAN
Which lab did Malcolm say?

1035
01:09:41,578 --> 01:09:43,385
L4.

1036
01:09:47,286 --> 01:09:49,325
This is it.

1037
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:03,306
â™ª â™ª

1038
01:10:08,172 --> 01:10:11,879
- Okay, get in,
get the sample and get out.

1039
01:10:12,015 --> 01:10:13,349
And move slow.

1040
01:10:13,485 --> 01:10:16,110
They can swarm at
the slightest disturbance.

1041
01:10:35,169 --> 01:10:37,197
â™ª â™ª

1042
01:10:40,339 --> 01:10:41,971
Orthoptera.

1043
01:10:42,979 --> 01:10:44,842
Two weeks.

1044
01:10:48,513 --> 01:10:50,379
Fully mature.

1045
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:52,019
This one.

1046
01:10:54,023 --> 01:10:55,886
Ready? Easy.

1047
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:01,861
Okay.

1048
01:11:01,997 --> 01:11:03,366
Go.

1049
01:11:04,362 --> 01:11:05,467
What?

1050
01:11:06,662 --> 01:11:08,228
Go get it.

1051
01:11:09,897 --> 01:11:11,441
Is that necessary?

1052
01:11:11,576 --> 01:11:13,942
What did you think
was gonna happen?

1053
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:15,377
I have to take a sample.

1054
01:11:15,513 --> 01:11:17,180
We need concrete evidence.
This is it.

1055
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:19,210
Alan, you said
there was no time.

1056
01:11:19,345 --> 01:11:20,707
Can you get it?

1057
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:22,880
Of course I can get it.

1058
01:11:23,883 --> 01:11:26,422
-Easy. -

1059
01:11:27,419 --> 01:11:28,890
Watch its legs.

1060
01:11:31,588 --> 01:11:33,027
Here we go.

1061
01:11:35,059 --> 01:11:36,228
They're cell signaling
between them.

1062
01:11:36,364 --> 01:11:37,426
This is not good, Ellie.

1063
01:11:37,562 --> 01:11:38,693
Almost got it.

1064
01:11:41,263 --> 01:11:43,602
How does she remain
an asset, Henry,

1065
01:11:43,737 --> 01:11:45,441
if you're incriminating
both of us

1066
01:11:45,576 --> 01:11:47,774
by showing her classified things
on the computer?

1067
01:11:47,909 --> 01:11:49,202
HENRY
Charlotte Lockwood believed

1068
01:11:49,337 --> 01:11:50,605
the methods we used
at Jurassic Park

1069
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:52,606
could cure disease.

1070
01:11:52,742 --> 01:11:54,109
She was right.

1071
01:11:54,244 --> 01:11:56,446
Having filled the gaps
in Maisie's genome

1072
01:11:56,581 --> 01:11:58,384
with altered DNA,

1073
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,080
she used a pathogen to deliver

1074
01:12:00,216 --> 01:12:02,124
the repaired sequence
to every cell.

1075
01:12:02,259 --> 01:12:04,489
If I can repurpose what she did,

1076
01:12:04,624 --> 01:12:06,890
I could change the locusts' DNA,

1077
01:12:07,025 --> 01:12:09,159
eradicating them
in a single generation.

1078
01:12:09,295 --> 01:12:13,099
Maisie and the baby raptor
will provide the missing data.

1079
01:12:20,137 --> 01:12:22,445
Hey, do you want
to get out of here?

1080
01:12:25,813 --> 01:12:27,813
-- What the...?

1081
01:12:28,912 --> 01:12:30,150
-Got it.

1082
01:12:34,490 --> 01:12:35,925
-- Go!

1083
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,096
-They're everywhere!

1084
01:12:42,231 --> 01:12:43,699
Help me! Oh, God!

1085
01:12:43,835 --> 01:12:45,926
No!

1086
01:12:48,106 --> 01:12:49,505
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1087
01:12:55,011 --> 01:12:56,472
Maisie.

1088
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:09,819
Asset containment breach.

1089
01:13:09,954 --> 01:13:11,692
Please remain at your stations.

1090
01:13:13,495 --> 01:13:14,824
Asset containment breach.

1091
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,561
Please remain at your stations.

1092
01:13:19,365 --> 01:13:21,768
-Oh, my God! Oh, God, I can't
see! -- Where's the key?

1093
01:13:40,552 --> 01:13:42,187
You okay?

1094
01:13:42,322 --> 01:13:43,759
Yeah.

1095
01:13:43,895 --> 01:13:45,355
You?

1096
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:46,853
Yeah.

1097
01:13:49,056 --> 01:13:50,467
Oh.

1098
01:13:56,299 --> 01:14:00,538
You're Dr. Ellie Sattler
and Alan Grant.

1099
01:14:00,674 --> 01:14:02,706
You were at Jurassic Park.

1100
01:14:02,842 --> 01:14:04,771
What-what are you doing here?

1101
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,774
What? What...

1102
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:08,749
what are you doing here?

1103
01:14:10,848 --> 01:14:12,654
I'm Maisie Lockwood.

1104
01:14:21,097 --> 01:14:22,856
Um...

1105
01:14:22,992 --> 01:14:26,095
Hey, we don't, uh...

1106
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:28,465
we're not...
we don't work for Biosyn.

1107
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,699
I can tell.

1108
01:14:29,835 --> 01:14:31,040
We got to get out of here.

1109
01:14:31,176 --> 01:14:32,238
Yeah, we should go.

1110
01:14:32,373 --> 01:14:34,401
â™ª â™ª

1111
01:14:47,924 --> 01:14:50,626
Okay, in and out--
we find your girl and go.

1112
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:53,663
Tower, this is N-141.

1113
01:14:53,798 --> 01:14:55,489
Request to land for
a freight delivery. Over.

1114
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:57,897
- Uh, N-141, negative.
We've been advised

1115
01:14:58,032 --> 01:15:00,060
you're carrying
unauthorized passengers. Over.

1116
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:01,503
Copy that, tower.

1117
01:15:01,638 --> 01:15:03,800
Be advised
shipment is perishable.

1118
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:05,301
We need immediate clearance.

1119
01:15:05,436 --> 01:15:07,907
-It's an emergency. Over.
-There isn't... No.

1120
01:15:08,042 --> 01:15:10,346
Uh, negative.
Return to point of origin.

1121
01:15:10,481 --> 01:15:11,943
Uh, you seem to be breaking up.

1122
01:15:12,078 --> 01:15:13,473
Are-are you hearing me
on your side?

1123
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:17,884
Nice try, Kayla.
They will down your bird.

1124
01:15:18,917 --> 01:15:20,955
Who is this? Is this Denise?

1125
01:15:21,091 --> 01:15:23,422
You do not want me to start
spilling secrets, Denise.

1126
01:15:23,558 --> 01:15:25,093
You remember Dubrovnik.

1127
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:29,790
She's... Different Denise.

1128
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:31,799
In accounts.

1129
01:15:38,902 --> 01:15:40,505
Talked to Santos.

1130
01:15:40,641 --> 01:15:42,139
It's the girl's parents.

1131
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,181
Sh-Shut off the ADS.

1132
01:15:47,316 --> 01:15:49,181
You sure?

1133
01:15:49,317 --> 01:15:51,280
Uh-huh.

1134
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:58,623
What's that?

1135
01:15:58,758 --> 01:16:00,629
Uh, that's the, uh...

1136
01:16:00,764 --> 01:16:02,397
that's the aerial
deterrent system.

1137
01:16:02,533 --> 01:16:03,726
Keeps the airborne life away.

1138
01:16:03,862 --> 01:16:05,527
Why is it blinking?

1139
01:16:05,663 --> 01:16:07,362
Because dead-ass Denise in
the tower just turned it off.

1140
01:16:07,497 --> 01:16:09,063
We got to get out of
this airspace right now.

1141
01:16:14,043 --> 01:16:16,970
-That's another plane, right?
-Not exactly.

1142
01:16:20,011 --> 01:16:21,315
Is that a...

1143
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:23,047
<i>Quetzalcoatlus.</i>

1144
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:25,319
Late Cretaceous.
Should've stayed there.

1145
01:16:31,525 --> 01:16:33,925
Okay. Okay.

1146
01:16:34,061 --> 01:16:36,063
It's cool. We're good.
It's gone.

1147
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:54,849
This plane is going down.

1148
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:57,950
If you're going to eject,
you need to do it now.

1149
01:16:58,086 --> 01:17:00,087
I only got one chair,
and she's in it.

1150
01:17:00,223 --> 01:17:02,857
-You don't have parachutes?
-I wasn't expecting company.

1151
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:12,227
Claire.

1152
01:17:12,362 --> 01:17:13,860
We got to get you
off this plane.

1153
01:17:13,995 --> 01:17:15,263
What?

1154
01:17:15,398 --> 01:17:16,605
Parachute is gonna open
automatically.

1155
01:17:16,741 --> 01:17:17,801
If it doesn't,
you pull this lever.

1156
01:17:17,936 --> 01:17:18,933
Do you understand me?

1157
01:17:19,068 --> 01:17:20,642
-Claire!

1158
01:17:20,778 --> 01:17:22,306
If it doesn't open
automatically,

1159
01:17:22,442 --> 01:17:24,072
you're gonna pull this lever
here behind you, okay?

1160
01:17:24,207 --> 01:17:26,144
-10,000 feet!
-Hey.

1161
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,715
You're the one who's got to go
to get to her.

1162
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:29,884
You're her mom.
You're her only shot.

1163
01:17:32,786 --> 01:17:34,856
I'll see you again.

1164
01:17:36,022 --> 01:17:38,189
-I love you.

1165
01:18:26,937 --> 01:18:27,870
What's the plan?

1166
01:18:28,005 --> 01:18:29,607
Whatever happens.

1167
01:18:29,742 --> 01:18:31,440
That's the plan.

1168
01:18:41,116 --> 01:18:43,155
â™ª â™ª

1169
01:18:45,191 --> 01:18:46,825
-- Three.
-- That's it.

1170
01:18:46,961 --> 01:18:48,727
Alan, we need the code.

1171
01:18:48,862 --> 01:18:49,994
Let's try this thing.

1172
01:18:50,129 --> 01:18:51,361
-Yeah.

1173
01:18:51,496 --> 01:18:53,198
-ELLIE Get down.

1174
01:18:58,842 --> 01:19:00,536
-Thank God it's you.
-I don't know...

1175
01:19:00,672 --> 01:19:02,537
-This place is such a maze.

1176
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:03,912
-We were so confused.
-It's good you're here.

1177
01:19:04,047 --> 01:19:05,409
But I thought
we were straight-up lost,

1178
01:19:05,544 --> 01:19:06,981
then you said station three,
and I was like...

1179
01:19:07,117 --> 01:19:08,816
-We thought you said...
-Do you have the sample?

1180
01:19:08,952 --> 01:19:10,981
-What?
-What are you talking about?

1181
01:19:11,116 --> 01:19:12,822
The DNA sample-- do you have it?

1182
01:19:12,957 --> 01:19:15,417
Biosyn's responsible
for the locust epidemic.

1183
01:19:15,553 --> 01:19:17,019
Dodgson's covering it up.
You were right.

1184
01:19:17,155 --> 01:19:19,151
I'm-I'm here to help you.

1185
01:19:19,286 --> 01:19:20,858
Do you have it?

1186
01:19:20,994 --> 01:19:22,263
-Uh...
-Yeah.

1187
01:19:22,398 --> 01:19:23,495
Good.

1188
01:19:24,398 --> 01:19:26,095
This pod will take you
straight to the airfield.

1189
01:19:26,231 --> 01:19:27,835
We have a plane ready to fly.

1190
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,370
Ian told you
about Hexapod Allies?

1191
01:19:29,505 --> 01:19:31,571
No. I told him.

1192
01:19:31,707 --> 01:19:33,171
What?

1193
01:19:33,307 --> 01:19:35,372
-Okay, you guys got to go.
-- Wait.

1194
01:19:39,350 --> 01:19:41,048
Maisie.

1195
01:19:44,487 --> 01:19:45,745
Maisie Lockwood.

1196
01:19:48,754 --> 01:19:50,024
Go.

1197
01:22:17,871 --> 01:22:19,899
â™ª â™ª

1198
01:23:24,432 --> 01:23:26,438
â™ª â™ª

1199
01:24:04,574 --> 01:24:06,247
That was my baby.

1200
01:24:14,683 --> 01:24:16,723
Where'd you learn to fly?

1201
01:24:16,859 --> 01:24:18,727
Uh, Air Force.

1202
01:24:18,863 --> 01:24:20,221
Legacy on my mama's side.

1203
01:24:20,356 --> 01:24:21,955
Yeah. I'm Navy.

1204
01:24:22,958 --> 01:24:24,859
And so, how'd you end up
doing this?

1205
01:24:24,994 --> 01:24:27,033
I was a legit contract pilot
for a grip,

1206
01:24:27,169 --> 01:24:28,531
but didn't exactly pay enough

1207
01:24:28,667 --> 01:24:30,395
to be out here
and send the money home,

1208
01:24:30,531 --> 01:24:33,003
so I hit up a few contacts for
the more lucrative shady shit.

1209
01:24:34,807 --> 01:24:37,010
Honestly, I might be done
with this line of work.

1210
01:24:37,146 --> 01:24:38,877
Is that why you're helping us?

1211
01:24:42,342 --> 01:24:45,121
I was there when they handed
your girl off to Biosyn.

1212
01:24:46,322 --> 01:24:49,682
I could've said something,
but I didn't.

1213
01:24:49,818 --> 01:24:51,853
And when I saw her picture...

1214
01:24:53,965 --> 01:24:55,696
It isn't enough to do nothing.

1215
01:25:01,067 --> 01:25:02,534
Thank you.

1216
01:25:07,975 --> 01:25:10,542
â™ª â™ª

1217
01:25:48,951 --> 01:25:50,846
No.

1218
01:25:55,252 --> 01:25:56,251
Nope.

1219
01:25:56,386 --> 01:25:58,425
â™ª â™ª

1220
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:22,317
What an asshole.

1221
01:26:30,387 --> 01:26:32,426
â™ª â™ª

1222
01:27:13,331 --> 01:27:14,695
You good?

1223
01:27:14,831 --> 01:27:16,169
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1224
01:27:16,304 --> 01:27:17,629
Yeah, I'm not shook at all. You?

1225
01:27:17,765 --> 01:27:19,803
Nah. Nah, no.

1226
01:27:21,641 --> 01:27:23,540
The ejection seat beacon.

1227
01:27:23,675 --> 01:27:26,145
-We'll find her.
-Okay. Okay.

1228
01:27:26,281 --> 01:27:28,141
You really love her, huh?

1229
01:27:29,610 --> 01:27:31,148
Yeah.

1230
01:27:31,283 --> 01:27:32,783
I get it.

1231
01:27:33,848 --> 01:27:35,720
I like redheads, too.

1232
01:27:36,717 --> 01:27:38,486
What? God.

1233
01:27:41,832 --> 01:27:42,889
Who is that?

1234
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:44,891
It's Grant and Sattler.

1235
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,026
-Is this live?
-12 minutes ago.

1236
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:48,760
We were tracking
the escaped asset.

1237
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:50,196
Our guys missed it.

1238
01:27:50,332 --> 01:27:52,300
-They stole a DNA sample.

1239
01:27:53,303 --> 01:27:55,272
-How'd they get in there?
-They used an access key.

1240
01:27:55,408 --> 01:27:57,542
Yankee White clearance.

1241
01:27:57,677 --> 01:27:59,544
One of our cameras
saw Ian Malcolm

1242
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,883
put something
in Sattler's pocket.

1243
01:28:02,019 --> 01:28:04,050
All right.

1244
01:28:04,185 --> 01:28:05,550
I want to see him.

1245
01:28:05,685 --> 01:28:08,186
And get Ramsay up here,
too, will you?

1246
01:28:08,322 --> 01:28:09,588
Where are they now?

1247
01:28:09,723 --> 01:28:11,624
On the way to the airfield.

1248
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,725
They caught the hyperloop
right on schedule.

1249
01:28:19,936 --> 01:28:21,896
How are you?

1250
01:28:22,031 --> 01:28:23,867
-You all right?

1251
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:26,408
Not really, no.

1252
01:28:28,372 --> 01:28:30,110
Hey.

1253
01:28:30,245 --> 01:28:32,744
I, uh, knew your mom.

1254
01:28:36,116 --> 01:28:37,245
You did?

1255
01:28:37,381 --> 01:28:38,915
Mm-hmm.

1256
01:28:40,249 --> 01:28:43,887
Yeah, a few years
after Hammond died,

1257
01:28:44,023 --> 01:28:47,929
she came to my university
to lecture, and...

1258
01:28:48,065 --> 01:28:49,931
we became good friends.

1259
01:28:50,066 --> 01:28:51,800
What was she like?

1260
01:28:51,935 --> 01:28:53,235
Brilliant.

1261
01:28:53,371 --> 01:28:55,067
Light-years ahead
of everybody else.

1262
01:28:56,734 --> 01:28:58,407
And she had a conscience.

1263
01:28:58,542 --> 01:29:00,737
While they were out
building theme parks,

1264
01:29:00,873 --> 01:29:02,475
well, she was
determined to prove

1265
01:29:02,611 --> 01:29:04,809
that genetic power
could save lives.

1266
01:29:06,106 --> 01:29:07,682
And I was her experiment.

1267
01:29:07,818 --> 01:29:09,275
No.

1268
01:29:11,379 --> 01:29:13,380
She wanted a child
more than anything.

1269
01:29:14,317 --> 01:29:17,558
But she wanted you to have
what she couldn't.

1270
01:29:18,555 --> 01:29:20,319
A full life.

1271
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,093
I didn't know her long.

1272
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:28,261
But I know
she loved you very much.

1273
01:29:48,490 --> 01:29:49,953
What's happening?

1274
01:29:54,928 --> 01:29:57,294
- This must be
the old amber mines.

1275
01:29:58,330 --> 01:30:01,965
They must have made access doors
when they built these tunnels.

1276
01:30:18,351 --> 01:30:20,379
â™ª â™ª

1277
01:30:26,195 --> 01:30:27,595
Hey.

1278
01:30:27,730 --> 01:30:30,026
I heard the alarm.
Everything all right?

1279
01:30:30,162 --> 01:30:32,431
Yeah, no, no.
Nothing we can't, uh, handle.

1280
01:30:32,566 --> 01:30:34,168
-Listen...
-You rang?

1281
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:35,894
Oh, good. Dr. Malcolm.

1282
01:30:36,029 --> 01:30:38,202
You are... fired.

1283
01:30:38,337 --> 01:30:39,898
What?

1284
01:30:40,034 --> 01:30:43,238
It was such a cushy gig.

1285
01:30:43,373 --> 01:30:46,378
You can, uh, give
your access key to security,

1286
01:30:46,513 --> 01:30:48,245
if you still have it.

1287
01:30:48,381 --> 01:30:49,710
One of the hyperloop pods just
shut down in the amber mines.

1288
01:30:49,846 --> 01:30:51,344
What?

1289
01:30:52,353 --> 01:30:54,618
Wow. This day.

1290
01:30:54,753 --> 01:30:56,617
Uh, which... which pod are we...

1291
01:30:56,752 --> 01:30:58,620
Are there, um...

1292
01:30:58,756 --> 01:31:00,526
dinosaurs in the mines?

1293
01:31:00,661 --> 01:31:02,191
There are dinosaurs everywhere.

1294
01:31:02,327 --> 01:31:03,395
I mean, you know, technically,
birds are dinosaurs.

1295
01:31:03,531 --> 01:31:04,896
Ge-Genetically speaking...

1296
01:31:05,031 --> 01:31:06,535
Okay, Lewis, Grant and Sattler
are in this pod.

1297
01:31:06,670 --> 01:31:08,294
We need to send
a security team out there ASAP.

1298
01:31:08,429 --> 01:31:10,132
Okay. Absolutely, Ramsay.
Thank you.

1299
01:31:10,267 --> 01:31:12,298
Uh, let's all just stay
in our lanes, though.

1300
01:31:12,434 --> 01:31:14,476
We can take care of it.
Thank you, Doctor.

1301
01:31:14,612 --> 01:31:16,975
That's it, huh?
Nothing else to see here?

1302
01:31:17,110 --> 01:31:20,405
Uh, I'm not sure I admire
your tone right now.

1303
01:31:20,541 --> 01:31:22,716
-You need to leave.
-- Yeah, I do.

1304
01:31:22,852 --> 01:31:26,148
But first, I owe
all these folks an apology.

1305
01:31:26,283 --> 01:31:28,455
I think that by lending
my cachet to this joint

1306
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:30,381
I might have made it seem as if

1307
01:31:30,517 --> 01:31:31,917
Biosyn wasn't
rotten to the core.

1308
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,151
That's enough, Ian.

1309
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:34,394
See, here's how they get you.

1310
01:31:34,529 --> 01:31:35,724
They give you so many promotions

1311
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:37,457
in a short period of time

1312
01:31:37,592 --> 01:31:39,295
that it bludgeons your capacity
for critical thinking.

1313
01:31:39,431 --> 01:31:42,070
-Oh, my God. -So then there are
doors that you don't open,

1314
01:31:42,206 --> 01:31:43,838
things that you ignore.

1315
01:31:43,974 --> 01:31:49,139
But mainly, he's exploiting
your enchantment with these.

1316
01:31:49,274 --> 01:31:51,240
Is there an actual concern
here, or are you just...

1317
01:31:51,376 --> 01:31:53,609
You're racing toward
the extinction of our species,

1318
01:31:53,745 --> 01:31:55,443
and you don't care.

1319
01:31:55,579 --> 01:31:58,184
You know exactly what you're
doing, but you won't stop.

1320
01:31:58,319 --> 01:31:59,753
You can't.

1321
01:31:59,888 --> 01:32:01,588
You know, I thought
you might be different,

1322
01:32:01,724 --> 01:32:03,082
but you're just like
everyone else.

1323
01:32:03,218 --> 01:32:04,490
You see what you want to see.

1324
01:32:04,626 --> 01:32:07,425
You imagine unchecked avarice,

1325
01:32:07,561 --> 01:32:09,423
so that's what you find.

1326
01:32:09,558 --> 01:32:12,597
You envision what,
an evil, unbound Prometheus?

1327
01:32:12,732 --> 01:32:14,092
So that's what I am to you?

1328
01:32:14,227 --> 01:32:15,669
Prometheus got gored.

1329
01:32:15,805 --> 01:32:18,301
So will you,
you rapacious rat bastard.

1330
01:32:18,436 --> 01:32:22,602
Ramsay, would you help
Dr. Malcolm gather his things?

1331
01:32:23,572 --> 01:32:25,845
His room, and then
to the airfield. That's it.

1332
01:32:35,322 --> 01:32:36,790
Dodgson.

1333
01:33:22,568 --> 01:33:24,871
â™ª â™ª

1334
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:42,383
Oh, God.

1335
01:34:10,177 --> 01:34:12,116
<i>Allosaurus?</i>

1336
01:34:13,455 --> 01:34:15,217
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1337
01:34:15,352 --> 01:34:17,221
Largest known
terrestrial carnivore.

1338
01:34:18,224 --> 01:34:20,452
You put two apex predators
in one valley,

1339
01:34:20,588 --> 01:34:22,658
pretty soon there's only
gonna be one.

1340
01:34:43,385 --> 01:34:45,413
â™ª â™ª

1341
01:34:53,995 --> 01:34:55,896
ELLIE
Did you feel that?

1342
01:34:57,665 --> 01:34:59,359
That's an air current.

1343
01:34:59,495 --> 01:35:01,429
There must be
an opening up ahead.

1344
01:35:02,432 --> 01:35:04,502
How old is this mine,
do you think?

1345
01:35:04,638 --> 01:35:06,333
Just breathe.

1346
01:35:06,469 --> 01:35:08,667
Nobody panic.
Just watch out for bats.

1347
01:35:08,803 --> 01:35:10,505
-Who said anything about bats?
-I hate bats.

1348
01:35:10,640 --> 01:35:13,648
Well, there's probably no bats,
no falling rocks.

1349
01:35:13,784 --> 01:35:15,273
Just the possibility
of toxic gas,

1350
01:35:15,409 --> 01:35:16,818
dehydration, hypothermia.

1351
01:35:16,953 --> 01:35:18,886
Just possibilities,
nothing for certain.

1352
01:35:19,022 --> 01:35:20,787
Oh, I should've
left you where you were.

1353
01:35:20,922 --> 01:35:22,723
-Why did I bring you into this?
-What?

1354
01:35:22,859 --> 01:35:24,720
-You were happy
in your element. -What?

1355
01:35:24,856 --> 01:35:26,392
-Ellie.
-What?

1356
01:35:26,527 --> 01:35:28,423
I wasn't happy.

1357
01:35:29,365 --> 01:35:31,127
You weren't?

1358
01:35:31,262 --> 01:35:33,191
-- Do you guys have kids?
-What?

1359
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:34,961
Uh...

1360
01:35:35,096 --> 01:35:36,565
No, I-I do.

1361
01:35:36,701 --> 01:35:37,800
Two.

1362
01:35:37,935 --> 01:35:39,038
But not with him?

1363
01:35:40,804 --> 01:35:42,505
Uh...

1364
01:35:42,641 --> 01:35:44,379
no.

1365
01:35:44,514 --> 01:35:47,044
No, just old friends.

1366
01:35:47,179 --> 01:35:50,084
Just old friends.

1367
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:52,282
Really?

1368
01:35:53,213 --> 01:35:55,285
â™ª â™ª

1369
01:35:56,622 --> 01:35:58,651
- Won't be long before
security knows you're gone.

1370
01:35:58,786 --> 01:36:01,022
- Oh, a map.
That looks like an old map.

1371
01:36:01,158 --> 01:36:02,023
You don't have a new map?

1372
01:36:02,158 --> 01:36:03,390
There's an access gate

1373
01:36:03,526 --> 01:36:04,996
at the northeast corner
of the mine.

1374
01:36:05,132 --> 01:36:06,092
-If your friends make it out...
-If?

1375
01:36:06,228 --> 01:36:07,769
When they make it out...

1376
01:36:07,905 --> 01:36:09,561
-Yes, sir.
-...that's where they'll be.

1377
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:12,440
These roads are protected,
right?

1378
01:36:12,576 --> 01:36:13,908
Uh, yeah. I'd drive fast.

1379
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:26,619
You did good.

1380
01:36:26,755 --> 01:36:28,218
Uh, yeah, well, actually,

1381
01:36:28,354 --> 01:36:30,419
it's a complete disaster,
but thanks.

1382
01:36:31,426 --> 01:36:32,586
Not yet.

1383
01:36:39,534 --> 01:36:41,562
â™ª â™ª

1384
01:36:43,540 --> 01:36:45,104
Watch yourself.

1385
01:37:04,087 --> 01:37:06,125
-Ellie.
-Yeah.

1386
01:37:10,896 --> 01:37:12,560
What was that?

1387
01:37:18,905 --> 01:37:20,271
Be careful.

1388
01:37:35,323 --> 01:37:36,485
-Oh, my God, Alan.
-Oh, my God. Are you okay?

1389
01:37:54,906 --> 01:37:56,109
Forget the hat!

1390
01:37:57,274 --> 01:37:59,244
-Come on!

1391
01:38:06,656 --> 01:38:07,989
Go, go, go!

1392
01:38:08,988 --> 01:38:10,750
Go, go, go, go, go!

1393
01:38:15,124 --> 01:38:16,426
It's a car.

1394
01:38:18,331 --> 01:38:20,292
-Oh, my God. Ian!
-Ian, over here!

1395
01:38:21,962 --> 01:38:23,630
-- Please, Ian!
-- Open the gate.

1396
01:38:23,766 --> 01:38:25,067
-Please help us.

1397
01:38:25,202 --> 01:38:26,732
Do you know the code?

1398
01:38:26,867 --> 01:38:28,606
I didn't know there was
gonna be a code.

1399
01:38:29,375 --> 01:38:31,373
I didn't know there was
gonna be a code.

1400
01:38:31,508 --> 01:38:33,872
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1401
01:38:35,345 --> 01:38:37,213
The brake! Pull the brake!

1402
01:38:37,348 --> 01:38:39,053
There are 10,000 possibilities.

1403
01:38:39,188 --> 01:38:41,514
-Push your legs against it!

1404
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:44,222
-1984.
-- Come on, Ian!

1405
01:38:44,358 --> 01:38:46,485
-Kick up against it! -Hurry!

1406
01:38:46,621 --> 01:38:50,497
Miles Davis's birthday-- 0526.

1407
01:38:54,870 --> 01:38:56,536
-Ian!
-Please, please.

1408
01:38:56,672 --> 01:38:57,772
Do something!

1409
01:38:57,907 --> 01:38:59,270
We're not gonna make it.

1410
01:38:59,406 --> 01:39:01,376
Let's-let's all try
and stay positive.

1411
01:39:01,511 --> 01:39:03,869
â™ª â™ª

1412
01:39:17,718 --> 01:39:20,820
-Please.
-I know, I know, I know.

1413
01:39:26,226 --> 01:39:28,267
-- Oh, my God! Close it!

1414
01:39:30,063 --> 01:39:31,930
What do you know?
It actually worked.

1415
01:39:36,737 --> 01:39:38,712
Ian, this is Maisie.

1416
01:39:38,848 --> 01:39:40,448
Hi, Maisie.

1417
01:39:40,583 --> 01:39:42,347
We got the DNA.

1418
01:39:43,514 --> 01:39:45,042
We need to get out
of this valley.

1419
01:39:45,178 --> 01:39:47,616
-Yeah. Let's go. Let's go.
-Come on. Come on.

1420
01:39:49,251 --> 01:39:51,950
â™ª â™ª

1421
01:40:18,722 --> 01:40:20,616
Come on. Come, come on.

1422
01:41:29,989 --> 01:41:31,757
Go on, get!

1423
01:41:31,893 --> 01:41:33,926
Yuck.

1424
01:41:34,062 --> 01:41:35,893
-Oh, my God.
-Hey.

1425
01:41:36,028 --> 01:41:38,193
Oh, my God.

1426
01:41:38,329 --> 01:41:39,767
I thought you were dead.

1427
01:41:39,902 --> 01:41:41,493
What do they even eat?

1428
01:41:46,667 --> 01:41:48,341
We better get inside.

1429
01:42:10,095 --> 01:42:12,167
â™ª â™ª

1430
01:42:28,785 --> 01:42:30,680
Oh, go ahead.

1431
01:43:01,311 --> 01:43:03,383
â™ª â™ª

1432
01:43:09,558 --> 01:43:11,824
- Containment
chamber compromised.

1433
01:43:27,777 --> 01:43:29,268
It's locked.

1434
01:43:29,403 --> 01:43:31,510
Gonna need something heavy,
something sharp or both.

1435
01:43:42,519 --> 01:43:45,623
That... can't be right.

1436
01:43:57,304 --> 01:43:59,366
-Is that...?
-Oh, no.

1437
01:43:59,501 --> 01:44:01,199
Oh, my God.

1438
01:44:02,936 --> 01:44:04,609
He's burning the evidence.

1439
01:44:06,048 --> 01:44:07,378
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

1440
01:44:07,513 --> 01:44:09,383
-Oh, my... Ew!
-That's bananas.

1441
01:44:27,001 --> 01:44:28,269
Oh, my God.

1442
01:44:28,405 --> 01:44:33,341
I-I-I know this may seem
precarious, but...

1443
01:44:34,341 --> 01:44:35,640
No, we're-we're teetering.

1444
01:44:38,372 --> 01:44:40,414
Should we all lean
to the left or something?

1445
01:44:40,550 --> 01:44:42,045
That's very constructive.
Thank you, Maisie.

1446
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:44,246
Yeah.

1447
01:44:44,381 --> 01:44:46,684
Slow. Slow.

1448
01:44:47,922 --> 01:44:49,555
Slow.

1449
01:44:51,860 --> 01:44:53,519
Yay.

1450
01:44:53,654 --> 01:44:54,929
We're fine.

1451
01:44:55,064 --> 01:44:56,920
-See this?
-Mm-hmm.

1452
01:44:57,056 --> 01:44:58,531
-This is fine.
-Mm-hmm.

1453
01:45:12,546 --> 01:45:13,781
-- Alan?

1454
01:45:13,916 --> 01:45:15,542
Alan!

1455
01:45:15,677 --> 01:45:17,251
How is everybody?

1456
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:29,287
It's my parents.

1457
01:45:30,294 --> 01:45:31,790
Help!

1458
01:45:31,926 --> 01:45:33,425
Help!

1459
01:45:33,561 --> 01:45:34,796
Listen.

1460
01:45:34,932 --> 01:45:37,438
-- Help! Help!

1461
01:45:42,070 --> 01:45:44,112
CLAIRE
Oh, my God.

1462
01:45:44,247 --> 01:45:46,011
You're okay.

1463
01:45:46,146 --> 01:45:48,005
You're okay.

1464
01:45:48,141 --> 01:45:49,414
You came to get me, actually.

1465
01:45:49,549 --> 01:45:50,612
-You came to get me.
-Yeah.

1466
01:45:50,748 --> 01:45:52,912
Of course we did, sweetheart.

1467
01:45:53,047 --> 01:45:55,115
-Heya, kid.
-Of course.

1468
01:45:56,926 --> 01:45:58,657
I remember you.

1469
01:45:59,622 --> 01:46:01,990
Remember you, too.

1470
01:46:04,131 --> 01:46:06,159
â™ª â™ª

1471
01:46:11,998 --> 01:46:13,865
They helped me escape.

1472
01:46:14,001 --> 01:46:15,905
Yeah?

1473
01:46:18,145 --> 01:46:19,979
You okay?

1474
01:46:23,152 --> 01:46:24,848
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1475
01:46:27,452 --> 01:46:28,986
We got to go.

1476
01:46:29,122 --> 01:46:31,921
Gonna have to break a window
to get inside that thing.

1477
01:46:32,954 --> 01:46:35,060
Hope nobody's afraid of heights.

1478
01:46:47,507 --> 01:46:49,510
Don't move.

1479
01:47:07,954 --> 01:47:09,029
What is that?

1480
01:47:09,164 --> 01:47:11,228
<i>Giganotosaurus.</i>

1481
01:47:13,570 --> 01:47:15,734
Biggest carnivore
the world has ever seen.

1482
01:47:34,580 --> 01:47:36,055
Maisie, Maisie, look at me.

1483
01:47:36,190 --> 01:47:37,690
Look at me.

1484
01:48:17,092 --> 01:48:18,896
-Go, go, go, go.
-Come on!

1485
01:48:23,462 --> 01:48:25,896
-- No, no, no! No!

1486
01:48:30,412 --> 01:48:32,413
-Hustle.
-I'm gonna die!

1487
01:48:32,549 --> 01:48:34,110
-Climb. Climb, kid.
-No!

1488
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:36,617
-You're not. No, you're not.
You're okay. -

1489
01:48:45,055 --> 01:48:47,192
-Go, go, go, go, go, go.

1490
01:48:47,327 --> 01:48:49,388
â™ª â™ª

1491
01:49:03,672 --> 01:49:05,470
Come on.

1492
01:49:06,444 --> 01:49:07,945
Hey.

1493
01:49:14,323 --> 01:49:16,283
Oh, yeah. Come here.

1494
01:49:32,973 --> 01:49:35,302
-Go, go, go.
-Help me open it. Help me out.

1495
01:49:39,709 --> 01:49:41,541
I got ya.

1496
01:49:42,811 --> 01:49:44,184
Go, go, go.

1497
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,851
Go, go, go, go, go!

1498
01:49:48,453 --> 01:49:49,514
Run.

1499
01:50:06,175 --> 01:50:08,038
See? Not so bad.

1500
01:50:14,578 --> 01:50:15,872
Come on.

1501
01:50:17,517 --> 01:50:19,082
Claire!

1502
01:50:49,449 --> 01:50:51,510
â™ª â™ª

1503
01:51:01,089 --> 01:51:02,960
Call an evacuation.

1504
01:51:03,095 --> 01:51:05,062
We need to bring
the animals inside.

1505
01:51:05,198 --> 01:51:07,061
The regulations are clear
that in the event

1506
01:51:07,196 --> 01:51:09,099
-of a level two...
-Shh!

1507
01:51:10,403 --> 01:51:11,970
Jeffrey.

1508
01:51:17,311 --> 01:51:19,170
God...

1509
01:51:19,306 --> 01:51:21,139
-...damn it!
-Oh.

1510
01:51:22,449 --> 01:51:24,778
Just...

1511
01:51:24,914 --> 01:51:26,312
Just call it.

1512
01:51:26,448 --> 01:51:28,579
-Attention, attention.

1513
01:51:28,715 --> 01:51:30,855
This is an immediate
evacuation order.

1514
01:51:30,991 --> 01:51:33,091
Remote herding system
is now active.

1515
01:51:33,226 --> 01:51:36,428
All living assets en route
to emergency containment.

1516
01:51:38,564 --> 01:51:40,592
â™ª â™ª

1517
01:51:59,319 --> 01:52:01,978
Can't get hold of anybody
since everything is, uh,

1518
01:52:02,114 --> 01:52:03,791
on fire.

1519
01:52:03,926 --> 01:52:06,293
-Dr. Sattler, get some water.
-Oh. Thanks.

1520
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:08,461
Dr. Grant? Here you are.

1521
01:52:08,597 --> 01:52:10,221
I'm, uh... I'm Owen Grady.

1522
01:52:10,357 --> 01:52:11,991
Big fan. I read your book.

1523
01:52:12,127 --> 01:52:13,564
Well, book on tape.

1524
01:52:13,700 --> 01:52:15,963
Owen Grady, Owen Grady.

1525
01:52:16,099 --> 01:52:18,168
Yeah, I know who you are.

1526
01:52:18,303 --> 01:52:20,900
-You trained raptors.
-Yeah.

1527
01:52:21,036 --> 01:52:23,001
I tried. Yeah.

1528
01:52:23,137 --> 01:52:24,501
How you doing?

1529
01:52:24,637 --> 01:52:26,339
-The one here.

1530
01:52:26,475 --> 01:52:28,305
You, uh... you were at
Jurassic World.

1531
01:52:28,441 --> 01:52:29,910
Jurassic World?

1532
01:52:30,045 --> 01:52:32,677
Not a fan. Mm-mm.

1533
01:52:33,714 --> 01:52:35,979
Okay, so we good to find
a way out of here?

1534
01:52:36,115 --> 01:52:37,182
Yep.

1535
01:52:37,318 --> 01:52:38,993
Let's get it.

1536
01:52:39,128 --> 01:52:42,223
- There's a helicopter
out in the main complex.

1537
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:44,724
We turn the ADS back on,
we go home.

1538
01:52:44,860 --> 01:52:47,531
-- Wait, what's an ADS?
-Aerial deterrent system.

1539
01:52:47,666 --> 01:52:49,067
Oh, uh...

1540
01:52:49,202 --> 01:52:51,562
You know,
for the pterodactyls and shit.

1541
01:52:51,698 --> 01:52:52,935
Keeps them away
from the helicopters.

1542
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:55,203
Well, how do we turn it back on?

1543
01:52:55,339 --> 01:52:56,840
Okay, it looks like
all the systems

1544
01:52:56,975 --> 01:52:58,336
run through to the control room,

1545
01:52:58,471 --> 01:52:59,772
which is on the third floor.

1546
01:52:59,908 --> 01:53:01,343
Oh.

1547
01:53:01,479 --> 01:53:03,477
These outposts are all
connected underground.

1548
01:53:08,854 --> 01:53:10,686
All right, easy, Rambo.

1549
01:53:17,432 --> 01:53:20,065
â™ª â™ª

1550
01:53:21,102 --> 01:53:23,266
- So you worked
in the raptor pen, huh?

1551
01:53:24,236 --> 01:53:26,071
-Yeah.
-Wow, and what-what happens?

1552
01:53:26,207 --> 01:53:28,408
Do you just tell 'em what
to do, and they, uh...

1553
01:53:28,543 --> 01:53:30,802
they comply or...?

1554
01:53:30,938 --> 01:53:34,546
Well, it's a human/animal bond
based on mutual respect.

1555
01:53:34,681 --> 01:53:36,910
Mm-hmm.

1556
01:53:37,045 --> 01:53:39,416
Had a dog once.

1557
01:53:39,552 --> 01:53:43,918
Humped my leg so much, I...
I got a callous on my shinbone.

1558
01:53:44,054 --> 01:53:45,618
That's a true story.

1559
01:53:46,593 --> 01:53:48,621
â™ª â™ª

1560
01:53:58,098 --> 01:53:59,603
Oh, God.

1561
01:53:59,738 --> 01:54:01,909
Hey. Good.

1562
01:54:02,909 --> 01:54:04,338
Here's what I'm thinking.

1563
01:54:04,474 --> 01:54:07,237
We get started again,
you and me.

1564
01:54:07,372 --> 01:54:09,477
I can get money.

1565
01:54:10,445 --> 01:54:11,781
Yeah, money's cheap these days.

1566
01:54:11,917 --> 01:54:13,149
What-what's the matter?

1567
01:54:13,285 --> 01:54:15,316
Don't look so worried.
There's...

1568
01:54:15,451 --> 01:54:17,517
There's opportunity
in everything.

1569
01:54:17,653 --> 01:54:19,691
E-Even this.
You'll-you'll learn that.

1570
01:54:19,827 --> 01:54:21,556
I've been thinking, um...

1571
01:54:22,559 --> 01:54:24,289
Maybe you take more
of a lead now, okay?

1572
01:54:24,424 --> 01:54:26,696
You're ready, I think.

1573
01:54:26,832 --> 01:54:28,329
Here, take...

1574
01:54:28,465 --> 01:54:30,234
What the hell is
the matter with you?

1575
01:54:39,404 --> 01:54:40,805
It was you.

1576
01:54:41,842 --> 01:54:44,150
You told Malcolm about
the program. You-you...

1577
01:54:45,186 --> 01:54:48,385
You set this whole thing up?
You set me up?

1578
01:54:48,520 --> 01:54:51,117
I gave you every opportunity
I did not have. I...

1579
01:54:52,620 --> 01:54:55,287
We have an understanding,
Ramsay,

1580
01:54:55,423 --> 01:54:57,360
and you do not break that.

1581
01:54:59,866 --> 01:55:01,760
I would not break this.

1582
01:55:04,704 --> 01:55:06,369
I'm not you.

1583
01:55:08,543 --> 01:55:10,604
â™ª â™ª

1584
01:55:20,986 --> 01:55:23,221
Oh, this is very bad.

1585
01:55:24,852 --> 01:55:26,926
This is the same system
we used at the park.

1586
01:55:27,062 --> 01:55:29,688
Great, so we can, uh,
turn on the...

1587
01:55:29,824 --> 01:55:31,831
the thing, and then we all
get out of here?

1588
01:55:31,967 --> 01:55:33,792
-Let's see. ADS...

1589
01:55:34,828 --> 01:55:37,330
What's this?
What-what's error 99?

1590
01:55:37,466 --> 01:55:38,896
Not enough power.

1591
01:55:39,031 --> 01:55:41,073
In a breakdown,
all available power is seized

1592
01:55:41,209 --> 01:55:43,208
by the primary system
to keep running.

1593
01:55:43,344 --> 01:55:45,211
We need all that power
to reactivate the ADS.

1594
01:55:45,347 --> 01:55:47,345
So the system's safety feature
is what's gonna kill us?

1595
01:55:47,480 --> 01:55:49,711
-Of course.
-How do we get more power?

1596
01:55:49,847 --> 01:55:51,751
Uh, well, we can't, but we can
redistribute what we have

1597
01:55:51,887 --> 01:55:53,346
if we just... just need to...

1598
01:55:53,482 --> 01:55:54,744
Shut down the primary system.

1599
01:55:54,880 --> 01:55:56,420
-Yes, exactly.
-Where is it?

1600
01:55:56,556 --> 01:55:58,055
-- Uh, next floor up.
-I'm coming with you.

1601
01:55:58,190 --> 01:55:59,686
We escaped down here.

1602
01:56:00,721 --> 01:56:02,192
Where is that?
Water treatment center.

1603
01:56:02,328 --> 01:56:04,394
Hydroelectric system--
sub eight.

1604
01:56:04,529 --> 01:56:06,098
Give me eight minutes,
I could find her.

1605
01:56:06,233 --> 01:56:08,362
-Wait, who's this now?
-- Beta.

1606
01:56:08,498 --> 01:56:10,428
-Blue's baby.
-Velociraptor.

1607
01:56:10,563 --> 01:56:12,598
-What?
-A baby raptor?

1608
01:56:12,734 --> 01:56:14,402
And you gave her a name.
How about that?

1609
01:56:14,538 --> 01:56:16,272
I made a promise
we would bring her home.

1610
01:56:16,408 --> 01:56:19,240
You made a promise
to a dinosaur.

1611
01:56:19,376 --> 01:56:20,944
You're coming with us, right?

1612
01:56:21,079 --> 01:56:22,612
Maisie, I...

1613
01:56:22,748 --> 01:56:23,875
Please.

1614
01:56:26,722 --> 01:56:28,149
I'll be on channel five.

1615
01:56:28,285 --> 01:56:29,751
-Okay.
-We're on three.

1616
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:32,851
Come back.

1617
01:56:33,861 --> 01:56:35,062
I always come back.

1618
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:39,033
I'll have that chopper hot
in ten. Wait for my signal.

1619
01:56:40,896 --> 01:56:43,135
DENISE
Evacuation phase four complete.

1620
01:56:43,271 --> 01:56:45,468
All living assets
now in containment.

1621
01:56:54,274 --> 01:56:55,445
Come on.

1622
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:09,452
Still get nightmares?

1623
01:57:09,588 --> 01:57:11,826
All the time.

1624
01:57:11,962 --> 01:57:13,430
You?

1625
01:57:14,429 --> 01:57:16,261
I have a lot of regrets.

1626
01:57:16,396 --> 01:57:17,764
Oh, yeah?

1627
01:57:19,002 --> 01:57:20,668
Well...

1628
01:57:20,803 --> 01:57:24,243
we hold on to regret,
we stay in the past.

1629
01:57:27,443 --> 01:57:29,413
What matters, I guess, is...

1630
01:57:30,819 --> 01:57:32,452
...is what we do now.

1631
01:57:32,587 --> 01:57:33,651
Right?

1632
01:57:33,786 --> 01:57:35,012
Yeah.

1633
01:57:52,471 --> 01:57:54,438
Nobody said there'd be bugs.

1634
01:57:56,440 --> 01:57:59,042
B4. She's in here.

1635
01:57:59,178 --> 01:58:00,979
Watch the sides.

1636
01:58:01,114 --> 01:58:03,678
They always come from the sides.

1637
01:58:05,217 --> 01:58:08,252
You know, at first we thought...

1638
01:58:08,388 --> 01:58:12,050
they disembowel their prey,
but no.

1639
01:58:12,185 --> 01:58:15,354
They're smart enough to go
straight for the throat.

1640
01:58:15,490 --> 01:58:17,791
The veins, the arteries.

1641
01:58:18,824 --> 01:58:20,524
Sometimes both at the same time.

1642
01:58:20,659 --> 01:58:21,835
Okay.

1643
01:58:21,971 --> 01:58:24,399
ELLIE
Oh, okay.

1644
01:58:24,535 --> 01:58:25,597
IAN
We've got you.

1645
01:58:25,732 --> 01:58:27,374
It's right down that aisle.

1646
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:29,403
-It's right down that aisle
where you are. -

1647
01:58:29,539 --> 01:58:31,075
Why are they skulking in-in...

1648
01:58:31,210 --> 01:58:32,338
You can sprint right for it.

1649
01:58:32,473 --> 01:58:34,843
Okay. Here it is.

1650
01:58:34,979 --> 01:58:37,010
Okay, so it-it'll be a yellow
button on a grid of six.

1651
01:58:37,146 --> 01:58:39,281
- There's a green button.
Do you see a green button?

1652
01:58:39,416 --> 01:58:40,614
It's not that green button.

1653
01:58:40,750 --> 01:58:41,722
-It's four...
-which one's the button?

1654
01:58:41,857 --> 01:58:43,023
Four from the bottom.

1655
01:58:43,159 --> 01:58:44,088
-Above the...
-- Whoa, whoa.

1656
01:58:44,223 --> 01:58:45,621
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Fourth one up?

1657
01:58:45,757 --> 01:58:47,122
Third one down
or fourth one up-- same thing.

1658
01:58:47,257 --> 01:58:48,591
Ian, be specific.

1659
01:58:53,529 --> 01:58:54,964
She was here.

1660
01:58:55,099 --> 01:58:56,863
Lights off.

1661
01:59:03,336 --> 01:59:05,368
I don't know how I could
possibly be more specific

1662
01:59:05,504 --> 01:59:08,209
other than to say that the one
you want is marked with...

1663
01:59:08,344 --> 01:59:09,947
-E1.
-E1. E1.

1664
01:59:10,082 --> 01:59:12,615
-E1.

1665
01:59:13,889 --> 01:59:16,051
-Yeah.

1666
01:59:19,961 --> 01:59:22,262
No. No, no, no, no.

1667
01:59:28,202 --> 01:59:30,736
Damn it, she's fast.

1668
01:59:33,367 --> 01:59:34,267
Hey.

1669
01:59:35,535 --> 01:59:36,907
Eyes on me.

1670
01:59:40,747 --> 01:59:43,677
- I've got to hit her
on the side of her neck.

1671
01:59:43,813 --> 01:59:46,018
Maisie, you're gonna
hold her focus.

1672
01:59:46,153 --> 01:59:48,948
Grant, we're triangulating.

1673
01:59:54,828 --> 01:59:55,955
Go.

1674
02:00:24,851 --> 02:00:26,282
Sorry, girl.

1675
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:29,428
I promised your mom
I'd get you home.

1676
02:00:30,663 --> 02:00:32,628
Primary system rebooting.

1677
02:00:32,763 --> 02:00:33,891
Wait. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

1678
02:00:34,026 --> 02:00:34,998
-No, no, no.
-No, no, no.

1679
02:00:35,133 --> 02:00:36,201
It's rebooting.

1680
02:00:36,336 --> 02:00:37,396
No, it shouldn't be doing that.

1681
02:00:49,345 --> 02:00:50,878
Here, take this.

1682
02:01:06,898 --> 02:01:08,101
-We got to stay on it.
-- Ian, shut it down!

1683
02:01:08,236 --> 02:01:09,700
We're-we're gonna make it work.

1684
02:01:09,835 --> 02:01:10,829
We're gonna figure this out.
It's very complex.

1685
02:01:10,964 --> 02:01:12,801
We don't have time for complex!

1686
02:01:17,810 --> 02:01:19,703
Primary system compromised.

1687
02:01:22,417 --> 02:01:23,845
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1688
02:01:23,981 --> 02:01:25,049
Aerial deterrent system active.

1689
02:01:25,184 --> 02:01:26,677
Victory! Victory!

1690
02:01:30,355 --> 02:01:32,150
Damn, that felt good.

1691
02:01:48,569 --> 02:01:51,235
â™ª â™ª

1692
02:02:00,053 --> 02:02:02,884
Oh, come on!

1693
02:02:54,075 --> 02:02:55,966
What's your story?

1694
02:02:59,639 --> 02:03:01,145
Wait!

1695
02:03:11,319 --> 02:03:13,323
LEWIS
At Biosyn, we're dedicated

1696
02:03:13,459 --> 02:03:15,493
to the idea that dinosaurs

1697
02:03:15,629 --> 02:03:18,124
can teach us more
about ourselves.

1698
02:03:22,628 --> 02:03:25,329
CLAIRE All right,
Kayla, we're good to go.

1699
02:03:35,478 --> 02:03:37,044
Okay, cutie.

1700
02:03:39,020 --> 02:03:41,048
â™ª â™ª

1701
02:03:42,816 --> 02:03:45,851
Oh, come here. Oh.

1702
02:03:45,987 --> 02:03:46,925
-You all right?
-Someday.

1703
02:03:47,060 --> 02:03:47,984
Okay.

1704
02:03:48,120 --> 02:03:49,852
-Hey.

1705
02:03:57,335 --> 02:03:58,502
I remember you.

1706
02:03:58,637 --> 02:04:00,703
Please, you have
to listen to me.

1707
02:04:00,839 --> 02:04:02,668
You created
an ecological disaster.

1708
02:04:02,803 --> 02:04:04,306
And I can fix it.

1709
02:04:05,309 --> 02:04:08,740
Charlotte Lockwood changed
every cell in Maisie's body.

1710
02:04:08,875 --> 02:04:10,683
It saved her life.

1711
02:04:10,818 --> 02:04:14,720
If I can understand how
Charlotte rewrote Maisie's DNA,

1712
02:04:14,856 --> 02:04:17,453
I can spread change from
one locust to the entire swarm

1713
02:04:17,588 --> 02:04:19,526
before it's too late.

1714
02:04:21,361 --> 02:04:24,256
It's okay. It's okay.

1715
02:04:27,533 --> 02:04:29,569
It's what she would have wanted.

1716
02:04:32,535 --> 02:04:33,940
Thank you.

1717
02:04:34,075 --> 02:04:35,536
No, no, no.

1718
02:04:35,672 --> 02:04:37,403
No, no, no, no, no.

1719
02:04:37,539 --> 02:04:39,207
Him?

1720
02:04:39,343 --> 02:04:40,608
Not him.

1721
02:04:40,744 --> 02:04:42,278
Not him. It's always him.

1722
02:04:42,413 --> 02:04:44,450
Every si...

1723
02:04:44,586 --> 02:04:46,850
Is that a dinosaur
on your shoulder?

1724
02:04:47,847 --> 02:04:49,880
Yeah. Why?

1725
02:04:50,616 --> 02:04:52,615
KAYLA I have air.
Meet me at the center.

1726
02:04:52,751 --> 02:04:54,458
No, no, no, no, no, no.
W-Wait, wait, wait. Hey, hey.

1727
02:04:54,593 --> 02:04:56,322
D-Do... do not land in here.

1728
02:04:56,458 --> 02:04:57,892
I don't have a choice, dude.
The valley isn't safe.

1729
02:04:58,028 --> 02:05:00,259
No, they're not
in the valley anymore!

1730
02:05:01,365 --> 02:05:02,936
Oh!

02:06:59,980 --> 02:07:01,578
Run!

1734
02:07:05,089 --> 02:07:06,789
Oh, my God!
Get him up, get him up!

1735
02:07:06,925 --> 02:07:08,921
-Come on, come on!
-Come on.

1736
02:07:12,032 --> 02:07:13,524
Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1737
02:07:17,833 --> 02:07:18,962
Come on!

1738
02:07:33,045 --> 02:07:34,578
Ellie, no!

1739
02:08:04,044 --> 02:08:05,543
Go on, Maisie! Go!

1740
02:08:07,547 --> 02:08:08,787
-- Ramsay, get in.
-- You're in.

1741
02:08:08,922 --> 02:08:10,724
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

No, at every level.

1747
02:09:43,350 --> 02:09:45,942
Complete systemic corruption
in-in the executive ranks.

1748
02:09:46,077 --> 02:09:48,245
"Systemic corruption."
You get that? Write that down.

1749
02:09:49,723 --> 02:09:50,954
Yeah, it's crazy.

1750
02:09:51,090 --> 02:09:53,184
Oh, and then...
and then we crashed

1751
02:09:53,320 --> 02:09:54,760
into this ice lake, right?

1752
02:09:54,896 --> 02:09:56,720
I mean, they literally
owe me a plane.

1753
02:09:56,856 --> 02:09:59,526
I need to get this sample
vetted at the lab

1754

before I take it
to my contact at<i> The Times.</i>

You could, uh, come with me.

Unless you need
to get back to your dig.

02:10:13,272 --> 02:10:15,409
-Ellie.
-Yeah?

1758
02:10:17,508 --> 02:10:19,446
I am coming with you.

1759
02:10:29,555 --> 02:10:30,956
-I know.

1760
02:10:31,091 --> 02:10:32,259
One more minute,

1761
02:10:32,395 --> 02:10:34,362

<i>By UN decree, Biosyn Valley</i>

1782
02:12:36,323 --> 02:12:39,025
<i>has been designated</i>
<i>a global sanctuary.</i>

1783
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:41,093
<i>The animals</i>
<i>will live there free,</i>

1784
02:12:41,229 --> 02:12:43,260
<i>-safe from the outside world.</i>

1785

-Money?
-Money.

1786
02:12:49,394 --> 02:12:51,070
Thank you.

Life on Earth has existed for
hundreds of millions of years.

1791
02:14:59,200 --> 02:15:01,827
And dinosaurs were only
a part of that,

1792
02:15:01,962 --> 02:15:04,498
and we're an even smaller
part of that.

1793
02:15:04,633 --> 02:15:06,997
They really put us
in perspective.

1794
02:15:08,299 --> 02:15:10,172
<i>The idea that life on Earth</i>

1795
02:15:10,307 --> 02:15:12,376
<i>existed 65 million years ago...</i>

1796
02:15:13,671 --> 02:15:15,346
...it's humbling.

1797
02:15:16,548 --> 02:15:18,948
We act like we're alone here,
but we're not.

1798
02:15:19,083 --> 02:15:22,917
<i>We're part of a fragile system</i>
<i>made up of all living things.</i>

1799
02:15:24,087 --> 02:15:27,859
<i>If we're going to survive,</i>
<i>we'll have to trust each other,</i>

1800
02:15:27,995 --> 02:15:30,121
<i>depend on each other,</i>

1801
02:15:30,257 --> 02:15:32,422
coexist.
