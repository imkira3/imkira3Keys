2
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,101
So I said, "If opposing counsel's
invoking fiduciary liability precedent

3
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:22,033
"under the terms of Landgraf v. Henson,

4
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:25,033
"Your Honor, please,
by all means, go ahead,

5
00:02:25,133 --> 00:02:29,509
"rescind the plaintiff's de facto petition
for injunctive relief."

6
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:31,267
- It was fun. It was fun.
- Yeah.

7
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:32,832
Excuse me, gentlemen. I'll be right back.

8
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:37,591
So funny. "Injunctive relief."
That tickled my funny bone.

9
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:44,058
- What's up, Nick?
- Fucking sucks dick about Grandma?

10
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:48,499
- Yeah.
- Old woman fucking murdered like that.

11
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:52,044
- Nick, she had cancer.
- That's what they want you to think.

12
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:54,665
She had cancer for 10 years.

13
00:02:54,765 --> 00:02:57,377
A little too convenient, Jason.

14
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,001
No, it's not, at all.

15
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,648
We'll never know the truth.

16
00:03:01,748 --> 00:03:03,415
- We absolutely know the truth.
- Yeah.

17
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:07,687
- Grandma had cancer for 10 years.
- You don't just die from cancer, Jason!

18
00:03:07,787 --> 00:03:12,206
It's a conspiracy, man. Just like 9/11.

19
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:17,230
Oh, God. For your information,
Grandma is not right here.

20
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,733
Grandma is gone and she was taken from us.

21
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:22,697
- And we must find the man that did this.
- Nick! Nick! Stop it.

22
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:26,833
Man! There are Rockport's.
Fuck, man. I just got these.

23
00:03:26,933 --> 00:03:30,366
- Calm down...
- I'll see you at the crossroads, Grandma.

24
00:03:30,466 --> 00:03:33,067
What are you doing?
Are you kidding me right now?

25
00:03:33,167 --> 00:03:34,616
Hey, get your shit together!

26
00:03:34,716 --> 00:03:37,983
My dad and my fiancee are literally
standing right next to us.

27
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,486
- Beyonce's here?
- No.

28
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,387
Your dad and fiancee
are saying yes to Beyonce?

29
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,555
What? No.

30
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:43,956
- Is Jay-Z here, too?
- No, Nick.

31
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,425
- Is Blue Ivy here?
- Nick.

32
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:48,745
I'm in the minority.
I think their kid's gonna be hot.

33
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:52,116
What is that?

34
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,832
- What are you doing?
- I'm just...

35
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,565
- Are you fucking high right now?
- No, this isn't...

36
00:03:55,665 --> 00:03:57,499
- You're high as a kite!
- It's an e-cigarette.

37
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,099
It's filled with a little weed,
but it's an e-cigarette.

38
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:03,247
- Grow up, man! What are you doing?
- "Grow up"?

39
00:04:03,347 --> 00:04:07,231
How adult are you?
What, do you listen to NPR in your Volvo?

40
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,765
You play racquetball competitively
against business associates?

41
00:04:09,865 --> 00:04:10,748
No. No.

42
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:14,041
You ever go away to a rented house with
other couples and then play Scattergories

43
00:04:14,141 --> 00:04:17,449
- over a bottle of white wine?
- Jason.

44
00:04:22,165 --> 00:04:24,896
I just blew a shot
at your grandma's memory.

45
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,131
Nick, get it together, right now.
Lock it up.

46
00:04:33,005 --> 00:04:34,404
I'm not hugging you.

47
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,256
If I hug you,
will you stop messing around?

48
00:04:45,816 --> 00:04:48,888
Crop-dusted, motherfucker.
You just got crop-dusted.

49
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:50,791
- You're high now. You're high now.
- Get the fuck away from me.

50
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:53,476
Now we're both high at Grandma's funeral.
We're bonded for life.

51
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:55,936
Uncle Dave, I'm sorry, man.
It's a tough day.

52
00:05:21,515 --> 00:05:22,931
Poor Grandpa...

53
00:05:44,613 --> 00:05:48,664
Our first reading
is from Deuteronomy 30:19.

54
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,947
"This day I call the heavens and the earth

55
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,548
"as a witness against you..."

56
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,380
"that I have set before you
life and death..."

57
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:03,047
Hey, babe, I found the tie you're going
to wear to the rehearsal brunch Sunday.

58
00:06:03,147 --> 00:06:05,879
Do you like the coral color or the salmon?

59
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:09,080
- "...that the race is not to the swift..."
- Either one.

60
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:11,723
"...nor the battle to the strong."

61
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:14,980
Babe, what's wrong?

62
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,912
Coral or salmon?

63
00:06:18,012 --> 00:06:20,313
- Well, what do you like?
- I mean... I like the coral.

64
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:23,114
That's what I was going to say, too.

65
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:26,223
- Okay, cool. Okay.
- Okay.

66
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,856
Coral it is!

67
00:06:29,513 --> 00:06:32,089
It's going to be a special day.

68
00:06:33,646 --> 00:06:37,688
"so that you
and your children shall live."

69
00:06:40,512 --> 00:06:44,047
Anyway, I'm down in Valdosta right now.
I opened up a fucking pet shop...

70
00:06:44,147 --> 00:06:47,180
- not pet shop, "puppy mill."
- Puppy mill...

71
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,259
You know, designer dogs get a bad name,
but they can go for quite a pretty penny.

72
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:54,045
- Really?
- It's just hard to get them to mate.

73
00:06:54,145 --> 00:06:57,222
Because the little dogs,
they don't wanna fuck the big dogs,

74
00:06:57,322 --> 00:06:59,612
and the big dogs,
they don't wanna fuck the little dogs...

75
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:02,209
so I gotta manually do it, you know.

76
00:07:02,309 --> 00:07:05,369
I gotta spread and manually shoot in.

77
00:07:05,969 --> 00:07:08,356
- So, what's up with you?
- Well, I'm keeping pretty busy...

78
00:07:08,456 --> 00:07:12,995
- Cool. Hey, Diane, how's it going?
- Hi, Nick.

79
00:07:13,095 --> 00:07:16,613
I just don't understand why you have to drive
down to Florida tomorrow already, Dad.

80
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:17,996
We just had the funeral.

81
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,512
Your grandmother and I were there
at this time every year.

82
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:25,145
It's what she would have wanted. I'd drive
down myself, except they took my license away.

83
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,979
But why does Jason have to be the one
to drive you? He's so busy at work.

84
00:07:29,079 --> 00:07:31,712
Got the wedding coming up next weekend,
the rehearsal brunch.

85
00:07:31,812 --> 00:07:34,679
You know, the entire law firm
is coming to this.

86
00:07:34,779 --> 00:07:39,229
- It's true, Grandpa. We have a lot of stuff...
- Jason... I'll handle it.

87
00:07:39,329 --> 00:07:40,778
Go ahead.

88
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:45,211
How about Cousin Nick? Dad?
Why doesn't Nick do it?

89
00:07:45,311 --> 00:07:49,012
We got this chocolate lab
down at the store that is just so horny,

90
00:07:49,112 --> 00:07:52,944
every time I touch the back of its ear,
it just gushes cum.

91
00:07:53,044 --> 00:07:55,245
- Okay.
- I mean, like a squirting...

92
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:57,192
Is that your dog?

93
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:59,878
Nick isn't legally allowed to leave
the state of Georgia anymore.

94
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,445
I've barely seen this guy
since high school.

95
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:04,579
What's wrong with spending
some time with him?

96
00:08:04,679 --> 00:08:07,545
So spending time with family
is suddenly important to you now?

97
00:08:07,645 --> 00:08:09,778
Look, he can come here
tomorrow morning for breakfast.

98
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:13,577
We can drive down to Boca during the day,
maybe play a round of golf or two,

99
00:08:13,677 --> 00:08:15,728
then he'd be back here
in Atlanta the next day.

100
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,851
He can't just flake off for two days!

101
00:08:17,951 --> 00:08:21,745
The risk versus reward here is just...
I don't see it happening.

102
00:08:22,345 --> 00:08:25,287
It's what she would have
wanted, that's all.

103
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:30,654
But if you have to get ready for
your wedding, if you're that busy...

104
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:42,777
I just don't understand why he wants you
to take him. You're not even that close.

105
00:08:42,877 --> 00:08:46,244
Well, we used to be.
Grandpa and I got along growing up.

106
00:08:46,344 --> 00:08:50,210
We used to build these model trains
every Christmas, so I brought him this...

107
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:52,229
It seems like we're cutting it
a little close here, you know,

108
00:08:52,329 --> 00:08:56,110
- with the rehearsal brunch on Friday...
- I know. I know.

109
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,744
By the way, I can't find any of the Martha's
Vineyard vacation photos for the slide show.

110
00:09:00,844 --> 00:09:02,127
I'm just freaking out.

111
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:04,694
That's because they're on my laptop,
which I've got right here.

112
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,527
So I'll send them to the wedding planner.
You don't have to worry about anything.

113
00:09:07,627 --> 00:09:11,360
Thanks. And your dad says take 75,
because 16 takes forever.

114
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,926
Yeah, I know.
He's got it all mapped out for me.

115
00:09:14,026 --> 00:09:19,093
And can you take my car, sweetie?
I need the SUV for the wine.

116
00:09:33,925 --> 00:09:35,735
Grandpa?

117
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:40,769
Grandpa?

118
00:10:03,626 --> 00:10:05,435
Grandpa?

119
00:10:15,426 --> 00:10:17,268
Hey! You made it!

120
00:10:17,859 --> 00:10:21,558
- Give me a minute.
- God! Shit!

121
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,559
- You ready to hit the road?
- I'm really sorry, Grandpa.

122
00:10:28,659 --> 00:10:31,424
I didn't think you'd be doing that.

123
00:10:31,524 --> 00:10:34,591
So you caught me taking a number three.
Big deal, right?

124
00:10:34,691 --> 00:10:37,925
- Number three?
- Have a drink.

125
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,058
No. I'm driving, so...

126
00:10:41,158 --> 00:10:47,890
I just got to finish up my exercises,
and then we'll hop on 16 to 95.

127
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:51,857
Dad says we should take 75 to 95.
It's more direct.

128
00:10:51,957 --> 00:10:56,601
- Dad's full of shit.
- Grandpa, are you sure you're okay?

129
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:59,557
Thanks for doing this, by the way.

130
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:02,292
Those fuckheads down at the DMV
took my goddamn license away

131
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:04,125
because of these
fucking cataracts in my eye.

132
00:11:04,225 --> 00:11:06,891
But I can still hit the shit
out of a golf ball, that's for sure!

133
00:11:06,991 --> 00:11:10,357
I made a tee time for us in Florida
for this afternoon.

134
00:11:10,457 --> 00:11:13,724
You can use your grandmother's lady clubs,
they're right there by the front door.

135
00:11:13,824 --> 00:11:15,667
Okay.

136
00:11:16,123 --> 00:11:17,624
All right, you ready?

137
00:11:17,724 --> 00:11:19,623
I thought the plan was
to have breakfast here?

138
00:11:19,723 --> 00:11:22,658
That's your breakfast. Now let's get
in that giant labia you drove up in

139
00:11:22,758 --> 00:11:25,167
and get the fuck out of here.

140
00:11:36,191 --> 00:11:38,957
You sure I should be driving
with this, Grandpa?

141
00:11:39,057 --> 00:11:43,899
Don't worry, if you spill it, this giant
tampon we're driving in should soak it up.

142
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:53,956
Just finishing a work email

143
00:11:54,056 --> 00:11:57,965
for the Steinhart file.

144
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,223
So you're a lawyer at your
dad's firm now, is that right?

145
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:04,055
That's right, and Meredith is too.

146
00:12:04,155 --> 00:12:06,456
You know, her dad is one
of the managing partners there, so...

147
00:12:06,556 --> 00:12:09,598
- I know, that's...
- Yeah.

148
00:12:09,722 --> 00:12:11,422
It couldn't have worked out better.

149
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,689
Because it's just that I remember
when you were in high school,

150
00:12:13,789 --> 00:12:16,294
you told me how much you wanted to be
a photographer, travel the world.

151
00:12:16,394 --> 00:12:21,457
That sort of thing. You remember when I
got you that subscription to Time magazine?

152
00:12:21,557 --> 00:12:24,755
Yeah, I used to be
into photography, but...

153
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:28,390
I mean, with Dad being at the firm...
it just made so much more sense

154
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:32,022
to focus on a college curriculum
that stressed the law school track.

155
00:12:32,122 --> 00:12:34,689
I mean, I love what I do, Grandpa.
Being a corporate lawyer is awesome,

156
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:37,774
- I get to handle SEC compliance...
- No shit!

157
00:12:37,874 --> 00:12:41,489
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You handle SEC compliance?

158
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:44,639
- LP agreements.
- Man, I didn't know that.

159
00:12:44,739 --> 00:12:46,622
- LLC agreements.
- You're shitting me!

160
00:12:46,722 --> 00:12:50,073
Being a corporate lawyer,
it's got its upsides.

161
00:12:50,173 --> 00:12:52,505
- You know what I'd rather do?
- What?

162
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:57,981
I'd rather let Queen Latifah shit in my
mouth from a fucking hot air balloon.

163
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:01,688
That's me. I'm gonna hit the liquor store
over there, get some more of the creature.

164
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:07,031
Meet you back at the Dildomobile in five.
You're paying the check, Alan Douche-owitz.

165
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,922
Where do I know that guy from?
He looks so familiar.

166
00:13:12,022 --> 00:13:16,489
- He looks like Abercrombie fucked Fitch.
- Yeah, while J.Crew J'd-off.

167
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:19,222
Shit! No, you guys, he was...
It's so funny.

168
00:13:19,322 --> 00:13:22,422
He was my lab partner
in photography class, freshman year.

169
00:13:22,522 --> 00:13:25,421
No shit! He's a Florida alum?

170
00:13:25,521 --> 00:13:27,655
Lenore, you can totally
finish the trifecta.

171
00:13:27,755 --> 00:13:32,455
Oh, my God, I already have alum, remember?
I fucked that crying divorced guy, Tony.

172
00:13:32,555 --> 00:13:34,189
- With the big balls.
- Yeah. Yeah.

173
00:13:34,289 --> 00:13:35,455
- In the porta-potty.
- Yeah.

174
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,887
- At the tailgate.
- Yeah.

175
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,189
I need a professor.

176
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:41,189
Wait, I'm sorry.
What's the trifecta again?

177
00:13:41,289 --> 00:13:43,860
It's this thing I read about where...

178
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,470
in my senior year I have to fuck
a freshman, an alumni, and a professor.

179
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:50,605
- Where did you read that?
- In my diary.

180
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:54,317
- Where I wrote it.
- He used to take the most...

181
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:59,354
beautiful portraits without using
any filters or Photoshop...

182
00:13:59,454 --> 00:14:01,555
- He was amazing.
- Oh, my God, you did?

183
00:14:01,655 --> 00:14:02,822
- Yeah.
- Did you like it?

184
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:05,053
You guys aren't listening.
I'm gonna go say hi to him.

185
00:14:05,153 --> 00:14:07,987
- Okay?
- Slut.

186
00:14:08,087 --> 00:14:10,853
I hope you don't get Tommy Hilfingered.

187
00:14:10,953 --> 00:14:13,421
That was really late, but it still counts.

188
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:15,754
Just like all my periods.

189
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:17,555
What?

190
00:14:20,421 --> 00:14:22,837
Hi. How are you?

191
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:25,587
Good. Here you go,
you can keep the change.

192
00:14:25,687 --> 00:14:29,388
No, no, no. I'm not... You...

193
00:14:31,321 --> 00:14:33,188
Okay.

194
00:14:36,619 --> 00:14:39,719
- Guys? Guys, listen to me.
- What?

195
00:14:39,819 --> 00:14:41,253
- Let's go.
- Bitch, what?

196
00:14:41,353 --> 00:14:44,488
- Shut the fuck up! Go!
- Oh, my God!

197
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,586
You all set?

198
00:14:47,686 --> 00:14:50,719
Yeah, I just gave my money
to the other waitress, sorry.

199
00:14:50,919 --> 00:14:52,987
There is no other waitress.

200
00:14:53,387 --> 00:14:56,786
I'm the only one
who's ever worked here. Ever.

201
00:14:56,886 --> 00:14:59,419
Shit! The fucking piece
of shit car never starts!

202
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,882
Hey! Hey!

203
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:06,753
God, he's like a Mitt Romney Terminator.

204
00:15:07,353 --> 00:15:08,487
Excuse me!

205
00:15:08,587 --> 00:15:11,987
Sorry, my shift is actually
over, so... Sorry.

206
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:14,618
- No way.
- What?

207
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,585
- I know you.
- No.

208
00:15:16,685 --> 00:15:21,019
Yeah, I do. You were in my photography class.
You took all those landscapes. Right?

209
00:15:21,719 --> 00:15:24,852
- Shadia.
- Yeah. Shadia.

210
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:27,270
Holy shit, you're Shadia?

211
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:28,968
- Yeah. Shadia.
- Shadia.

212
00:15:29,068 --> 00:15:31,385
- Jamba!
- What the fuck!

213
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:34,053
Shadia. It means "singer" in Arabic.

214
00:15:34,153 --> 00:15:37,453
Or in ancient Arabic,
"al-munshida alati tunadi lel-mei."

215
00:15:37,553 --> 00:15:40,219
Or, "she whose name
calls others to water."

216
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:42,553
- That's actually right.
- Shadia, this is my...

217
00:15:42,653 --> 00:15:45,719
Dr. Richards. I teach history
at the University of Georgia.

218
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,318
You're a professor?

219
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:50,319
Yeah. Why?
You looking for some extra credit?

220
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:52,585
Jason and I are doing
a story on the Middle East.

221
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,085
He's a photographer for Time magazine.

222
00:15:55,185 --> 00:15:58,585
You know, I lost my virginity
at my pop-pop's bingo night.

223
00:15:58,685 --> 00:16:00,485
My name's Lenore.

224
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:04,652
"The rare and radiant maiden
whom the angels named Lenore"

225
00:16:04,752 --> 00:16:07,485
"Quoth the Raven, 'Nevermore'"

226
00:16:08,117 --> 00:16:12,417
- Diplomaticos?
- Hey, you know your cigars.

227
00:16:12,517 --> 00:16:16,786
- What are you, half Cuban or something?
- Actually, I am, Professor.

228
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:20,785
- The bottom half.
- Okay.

229
00:16:20,885 --> 00:16:24,484
Yeah, we're heading out. Good to see you.
We're going to Daytona Beach for the week.

230
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:28,885
And we should have been there three
fucking hours ago, so let's go, bitches!

231
00:16:28,985 --> 00:16:31,285
- Holy shit.
- What?

232
00:16:31,385 --> 00:16:33,618
Nothing. You're just really gay.

233
00:16:33,718 --> 00:16:37,250
Am I? Thanks, Captain Gaydar.

234
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:41,584
- Jesus! You know, I'm also black, right?
- Yeah, I know. That's funny too.

235
00:16:41,984 --> 00:16:46,717
So you guys wanna tag along for a bit maybe?
Party some babies into us?

236
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:48,166
- Absolutely not!
- Absolutely not!

237
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:51,321
- Why?
- We have a very important tee time.

238
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:54,318
Of course you do. And do you also
take a nap before you play Mahjong?

239
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:56,984
No, it's shuffleboard.
And then early dinner at 4:00.

240
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,418
We have a long-standing bet.
Who's the better golfer.

241
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,551
Obviously I've got the bigger 3-wood.

242
00:17:01,651 --> 00:17:04,584
Good. Maybe you can use it to hit
your balls right into my vagina.

243
00:17:04,684 --> 00:17:07,844
- Holy shit!
- Okay, we're going inside now. Let's go.

244
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,684
- Bye, Professor.
- Thanks for lunch.

245
00:17:10,784 --> 00:17:12,119
Peace!

246
00:17:13,884 --> 00:17:15,734
- Nice girl.
- Yeah.

247
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,564
Well?

248
00:17:30,664 --> 00:17:31,809
How do I look?

249
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:34,617
Like the keynote speaker
at a buttfucking convention.

250
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:38,060
- What?
- What?

251
00:17:38,283 --> 00:17:40,851
We're gonna write in the first hole,
it's an easy par-4.

252
00:17:40,951 --> 00:17:42,716
- No, no, no, no. Hey...
- Jump in.

253
00:17:42,816 --> 00:17:45,283
- This is against the rules, Grandpa.
- Fuck the rules. Jump in. Come on.

254
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:48,350
Not to mention,
a breach in golf etiquette.

255
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:52,950
- Out of my way, buttfuckers!
- Really? What are you doing?

256
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:55,316
We gotta get this guy
to his buttfucking convention.

257
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,583
What are you trying to do, man?

258
00:17:57,683 --> 00:18:00,616
Hey. Now there's a million-dollar swing!

259
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:06,332
I'm sorry! You can go in front of us
if you want to. We are not very good.

260
00:18:06,432 --> 00:18:09,589
No, it's a good cut, you're just
not bending your knees enough.

261
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,648
I'm a licensed golf pro.
You mind if I show you?

262
00:18:11,748 --> 00:18:13,907
Yes, please.

263
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:18,666
Maybe bend over a little bit... Here.
That feels about right, doesn't it?

264
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,749
Hands on my shaft... the shaft.

265
00:18:21,849 --> 00:18:27,115
Let me just get my finger in there.
One, two, three...

266
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:29,981
- Oh, my God! Did you see that?
- Yeah.

267
00:18:30,081 --> 00:18:32,614
- Thank you!
- How long have you been teaching golf?

268
00:18:32,714 --> 00:18:34,881
Ever since I retired
from being an astronaut.

269
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:38,794
It's nice to see some
heavenly bodies around here too.

270
00:18:38,894 --> 00:18:42,414
Hey, Grandpa, don't you think we should
probably start golfing soon...

271
00:18:42,514 --> 00:18:45,116
- What the fuck?
- Wanna be a lamb and get that for me?

272
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:49,097
- Did he just call you "Grandpa"?
- Who, Pepe? He's a retard.

273
00:18:49,197 --> 00:18:52,114
Got it pretty bad, too.
He thinks I'm his grandpa.

274
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,116
He usually sits at home
just drawing dolphins all day.

275
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:59,582
We used to let him out on his own,
but the raping got so bad that we just...

276
00:19:02,114 --> 00:19:04,898
- Got it.
- You guys want a refill?

277
00:19:04,998 --> 00:19:07,705
- Absolutely!
- BRB!

278
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:12,614
I'm sorry about my grandpa.
He's... he's not doing too well.

279
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:16,881
My grandma just passed
and the funeral was yesterday.

280
00:19:17,515 --> 00:19:20,614
I'm actually a lawyer, not a retard.

281
00:19:21,114 --> 00:19:25,397
I handle of lot of important issues.
SEC compliance...

282
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,348
LLC agreements. LP agreements.
That sort of stuff.

283
00:19:30,282 --> 00:19:34,148
Yeah, well, I think we're gonna get going.

284
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,881
- Nice to meet you, Pepe.
- Nice...

285
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,713
Fuck!

286
00:19:42,661 --> 00:19:45,248
What happened?
Why are they going? What did you do?

287
00:19:45,348 --> 00:19:48,581
What? I told them the truth. I told them
that I'm getting married next week,

288
00:19:48,681 --> 00:19:51,281
and that you're not well
because your wife just died.

289
00:19:51,381 --> 00:19:54,348
What are you, fucking vagina repellent?
Those cougars wanted to party!

290
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:55,846
- They wanted to party?
- Yes!

291
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,247
Do you hear yourself?
Grandpa, are you kidding me right now?

292
00:19:58,347 --> 00:20:01,446
- I'm trying to listen to myself.
- Grandma's funeral was yesterday!

293
00:20:01,546 --> 00:20:05,846
Now you wanna hit on college girls?
You're jerking off to porn?

294
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,780
- Jason, I want to fuck!
- What's wrong with you? Oh, my God...

295
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,313
For the first time in 40 years
I'm single and I want to fuck.

296
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,187
I want to fuck until my dick falls off.
I want to fuck a horse

297
00:20:17,287 --> 00:20:19,579
- and I wanna drink its blood!
- I'm gonna throw up.

298
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,679
I was faithful to your grandmother
every day for 40 years,

299
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:26,046
even through the menopause,
even through the cancer.

300
00:20:26,146 --> 00:20:29,414
She was the love of my life.
I'll miss her every goddamn day.

301
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:33,446
But she told me on her deathbed,
"You get back out there again."

302
00:20:33,546 --> 00:20:37,712
I haven't had sex in 15 years, Jason,
and I want to fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!

303
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:41,696
So that's what this is all about? This whole
thing. You didn't want to be with me.

304
00:20:41,796 --> 00:20:44,462
You wanted me to drive you down to Boca
so I could be your fucking wingman?

305
00:20:44,562 --> 00:20:47,247
Obviously I made a bad decision because
you're nothing but a cock-blocking machine.

306
00:20:47,347 --> 00:20:50,111
I don't know what you are. You're like
the Israeli Iron Dome defense system,

307
00:20:50,211 --> 00:20:52,169
- but with vaginas instead of missiles.
- What?

308
00:20:52,269 --> 00:20:54,312
You're like some sort
of Cock-blocking Terminator

309
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,512
sent back from the future
to cock-block humans.

310
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:59,146
The robots should have sent you
instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger,

311
00:20:59,246 --> 00:21:02,713
you could have cock-blocked John Connor's
parents and he would never have been born!

312
00:21:02,813 --> 00:21:05,045
- Shut up, Grandpa! Shut up!
- What got into you?

313
00:21:05,145 --> 00:21:07,446
I remember you in high school,
you were ripping people's dicks off

314
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:10,145
on the football field,
talking about traveling the world!

315
00:21:10,245 --> 00:21:13,478
Now you're pushing some papers at a fucking
law firm and probably peeing sitting down.

316
00:21:13,578 --> 00:21:16,012
Grandpa, I don't know what you thought
this weekend was going to be about,

317
00:21:16,112 --> 00:21:20,344
but I came here for one reason,
to get you to Boca. That's it.

318
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,978
- Fine.
- Now can I please play some golf?

319
00:21:23,078 --> 00:21:24,378
- Fucking golf.
- Okay.

320
00:21:24,478 --> 00:21:26,745
Cocky McBlockerson.

321
00:21:31,878 --> 00:21:34,279
What the fuck?

322
00:21:39,294 --> 00:21:42,161
Who does your taxes? H&R Cock-block?

323
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,595
Stop it.

324
00:21:50,827 --> 00:21:52,462
Are you still Jenny from the cock-block?

325
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:56,061
What the fuck!
What is your obsession with my ass?

326
00:21:56,461 --> 00:21:58,462
Your vibrator's on.

327
00:21:59,328 --> 00:22:02,194
You can't get into it anyway
because you don't know my code.

328
00:22:02,294 --> 00:22:04,227
Looks like your grandpa
remembered your birthday!

329
00:22:04,327 --> 00:22:07,462
- What? Give me that!
- We're going to fucking Daytona.

330
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:13,134
We're not going to Daytona,
because I've got the keys to the golf cart.

331
00:22:15,928 --> 00:22:18,028
What are you doing?

332
00:22:18,428 --> 00:22:20,694
Hey. How'd you do that?

333
00:22:20,794 --> 00:22:23,095
- Coming or staying, Jack Dicklaus?
- Grandpa?

334
00:22:23,195 --> 00:22:25,161
- Hurry up, Bubba Twatson.
- Grandpa, stop.

335
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,361
- Gary Player-with-my-balls.
- Stop the cart!

336
00:22:27,461 --> 00:22:30,264
- Fred Couples-of-big-dicks-in-your-ass.
- Oh, my God. Grandpa!

337
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,645
- Michelle Wies-all-over-my-face.
- Stop!

338
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:55,892
Now, this is what
I'm fucking talking about.

339
00:22:56,192 --> 00:22:57,942
This is so fucked up.

340
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,859
Calm down, you'll get to hang out
with that gypsy girl you like.

341
00:23:00,959 --> 00:23:02,793
- I don't like her.
- Yes, you do.

342
00:23:02,893 --> 00:23:05,644
That's why you didn't deny being
a photographer for Time magazine.

343
00:23:05,744 --> 00:23:08,527
You can hang out with her,
I can have vaginal sex with Lenore.

344
00:23:08,627 --> 00:23:11,400
It all works out! We can even go visit
my old army buddy, Stinky.

345
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,301
Stinky?

346
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,999
Which tiki bar are they in?

347
00:23:17,099 --> 00:23:18,737
- Shit. Shit. Shit.
- What's that?

348
00:23:18,837 --> 00:23:20,932
It's Meredith.
Please, I've got to answer that.

349
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:22,566
- Tell her to fuck off.
- Grandpa!

350
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,564
I'm just gonna check the testosterone
levels on your phone first.

351
00:23:25,664 --> 00:23:28,447
- Grandpa, give me my phone now!
- Just as I thought. Pretty low.

352
00:23:28,547 --> 00:23:30,564
This is Meredith calling... Shit!

353
00:23:30,664 --> 00:23:33,332
Now, look what you did,
you dropped it in the car's vagina.

354
00:23:33,432 --> 00:23:35,729
Goddamn it, I have to put it on speaker.
Don't say anything.

355
00:23:35,829 --> 00:23:38,264
I will not say a word.

356
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:42,763
- Ballbags!
- Hey! Who was that?

357
00:23:42,863 --> 00:23:45,962
- No one. We're in a restaurant. Sorry.
- "Who's that?"

358
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,428
- What's up?
- Okay.

359
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:50,228
Well, I really want them
to post our wedding announcement

360
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:53,095
on the New York Times website
before our rehearsal brunch Friday,

361
00:23:53,195 --> 00:23:55,598
so I just wanted to run
your section back to you.

362
00:23:55,698 --> 00:24:00,328
- You know, now's really not a good time...
- Jason? Can we just do this please?

363
00:24:00,428 --> 00:24:02,695
"Can we do this now?"

364
00:24:02,795 --> 00:24:05,359
"Jason Richard Kelly, son of..."

365
00:24:05,459 --> 00:24:07,492
"Doctor Smegma Von BoxMunchers."

366
00:24:07,592 --> 00:24:12,825
"David and Brooke, is a junior
associate at the law firm of..."

367
00:24:12,925 --> 00:24:16,375
- "Cream pie fart and donkey punch!"
- Okay, who is that?

368
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:21,091
It's no one. It's a waiter
with pretty bad Tourette's, I think...

369
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:24,592
He just keeps walking by yelling
weird shit, I don't know why...

370
00:24:24,692 --> 00:24:28,224
Okay, well, what restaurant are you at?
I can barely even hear you now.

371
00:24:28,324 --> 00:24:30,157
We're at Chuck E. Cheese's...

372
00:24:30,257 --> 00:24:32,357
Daytona fucking Beach!

373
00:24:32,457 --> 00:24:35,255
Daytona fucking Beach!
You're right, buddy!

374
00:24:35,355 --> 00:24:38,322
You're in Daytona Beach?

375
00:24:38,722 --> 00:24:41,022
Listen, we're just driving through Daytona
Beach. We're en route to Grandpa's...

376
00:24:41,122 --> 00:24:42,649
Jason!

377
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:45,297
I don't know why you're there,
but you'd better call me

378
00:24:45,397 --> 00:24:48,389
from your grandfather's house
when you get there tonight, okay?

379
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:51,187
Of course, baby. I love you so much...

380
00:24:51,287 --> 00:24:52,854
- Fuck!
- Marriage is hard.

381
00:24:52,954 --> 00:24:55,454
What'd the hot college girls text back?

382
00:24:55,554 --> 00:24:57,387
- Grandpa, what are you texting them?
- I just texted them.

383
00:24:57,487 --> 00:25:00,054
What are you texting them?
"We'll meet you on the beach."

384
00:25:00,154 --> 00:25:03,620
Yeah, and I added the emoji
with the wink and the tongue out.

385
00:25:04,518 --> 00:25:06,920
I'm not kidding, Grandpa.
You realize that if I don't call her

386
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,284
from your house in Boca tonight,
I'm fucked, man, I'm fucked.

387
00:25:10,384 --> 00:25:13,518
Jesus. Sounds like you're marrying
your fucking parole officer.

388
00:25:13,618 --> 00:25:15,852
It's just Meredith.
It's the way she is, man.

389
00:25:15,952 --> 00:25:20,211
She just gets, like, anxious when
she doesn't know exactly where I am.

390
00:25:20,451 --> 00:25:22,416
Don't panic. It's organic.

391
00:25:22,516 --> 00:25:25,584
Yeah, I know. Couples get in fights all
the time. But it's different with Meredith.

392
00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:27,519
She takes it to another level, man,
and I'm telling you,

393
00:25:27,619 --> 00:25:30,416
if I don't call her
from your house in Boca, I'm screwed.

394
00:25:30,516 --> 00:25:34,315
- Ain't nobody got time for that.
- Yeah, I know. Clearly.

395
00:25:34,415 --> 00:25:37,616
Which is why I don't understand
how we got so far off schedule.

396
00:25:37,716 --> 00:25:42,049
Sometimes life is just a fart zone,
and you enter at your own risk.

397
00:25:43,382 --> 00:25:46,081
Have you been reading shit off
the shot glasses and the shirts in here

398
00:25:46,181 --> 00:25:48,046
and just saying it like it's wisdom?

399
00:25:48,146 --> 00:25:51,246
I was seriously trying to talk to you, man.
Do you realize the stakes here?

400
00:25:51,346 --> 00:25:53,413
- You're ridiculous!
- Smile.

401
00:25:53,513 --> 00:25:56,181
You've had a phone
this entire fucking time?

402
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:59,578
What else don't I know about you?
How the hell do you know how to speak Arabic?

403
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:01,411
Dad's never said anything about that.

404
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:03,412
That's because your dad
doesn't really know much about me.

405
00:26:03,512 --> 00:26:07,811
I was away with the army during most of
his childhood. So we were never that close.

406
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,246
Is that why he doesn't like you?

407
00:26:13,777 --> 00:26:15,411
Anybody work here?

408
00:26:15,511 --> 00:26:17,709
- Okay, everybody on the fucking floor!
- Get down!

409
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:22,219
This is a goddamn robbery!
On the fucking ground!

410
00:26:24,744 --> 00:26:27,443
Oh, my God, you should see your faces!

411
00:26:27,543 --> 00:26:29,776
I just left to grab lunch
and a new horse mask.

412
00:26:29,876 --> 00:26:32,842
I left mine at the beach the other day.

413
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:35,675
I thought you were gonna
shit your pants, little guy.

414
00:26:35,775 --> 00:26:38,140
Gun's real though.

415
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:42,091
- What the fuck, man!
- Relax, this is Florida.

416
00:26:42,191 --> 00:26:45,990
- Everything's a licensed gun range.
- You just shot through a wall, man!

417
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,422
- Hey...
- There's pedestrians outside!

418
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,722
Yeah, again, it's Florida!
These people don't matter.

419
00:26:51,822 --> 00:26:55,289
- What?
- So? Welcome to Tam Pam Surf Slam.

420
00:26:55,389 --> 00:26:58,387
- What can I do for you gentlemen? I'm Pam.
- You're Pam?

421
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:01,821
Yeah. It's a nickname. Real name's Pamela.

422
00:27:03,354 --> 00:27:06,287
Hey, no, guys! Absolutely not!

423
00:27:06,387 --> 00:27:12,221
I will not ever sell you drugs
out of this establishment!

424
00:27:12,321 --> 00:27:15,452
- We didn't ask you to sell us drugs.
- Okay, cool. You're not cops.

425
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,678
In which case...

426
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:20,982
- welcome to drugs!
- Oh, my God.

427
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:24,219
Now, I'm pretty cool, so I only sell
the stuff that occurs naturally.

428
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,085
So I got weed, I got mushrooms,
I got meth. I got...

429
00:27:27,185 --> 00:27:28,319
- Meth?
- Yeah.

430
00:27:28,419 --> 00:27:30,185
- How is that natural?
- Well, it occurs naturally

431
00:27:30,285 --> 00:27:33,384
in my cousin's basement in Baltimore,
if you know what I mean.

432
00:27:34,385 --> 00:27:35,587
Okay, fine.

433
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:39,415
Drugs aren't your thing, got it.
Message received.

434
00:27:39,515 --> 00:27:43,294
In which case, listen, we got a great
local charity here. Pam's Kidz.

435
00:27:43,594 --> 00:27:46,030
- What's Pam's Kidz?
- That's my kids.

436
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,168
I got four kids by six different women.
I know, the numbers don't add up.

437
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,804
Most of them are pretty
developmentally disabled.

438
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,940
One of them you gotta
push around in a wheelchair.

439
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,311
Hey-o! Now that is the generosity of
the human spirit and I appreciate that.

440
00:28:00,411 --> 00:28:03,582
Now some of this money is gonna feed my kids,
some of it is gonna get me a blowjob

441
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:07,163
by a toothless whore behind
the dumpster down at the McDonalds.

442
00:28:36,428 --> 00:28:37,929
- Hey.
- Hey.

443
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:39,196
Hi, Professor.

444
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,495
Well, there's the prettiest
little girl on the beach.

445
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:43,929
- Thank you.
- I was actually talking to him.

446
00:28:44,029 --> 00:28:47,828
Yup! Immediately offensive.
I'm going back to the hotel.

447
00:28:47,928 --> 00:28:51,293
Just try not to join the cast
of Rent on the way back.

448
00:28:51,593 --> 00:28:54,677
So we got the Professor,
you got the millionaire.

449
00:28:54,777 --> 00:28:56,609
How's the rest
of the Gilligan's Island cast?

450
00:28:57,924 --> 00:28:59,360
- We're good. Yeah, everyone's good.
- Yeah?

451
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,025
- Well, that's good.
- Copacetic on the island.

452
00:29:02,125 --> 00:29:03,492
How are those washed-out
pictures you're taking

453
00:29:03,592 --> 00:29:05,439
because you still have
the lighting optimizer on?

454
00:29:05,539 --> 00:29:08,439
- Where is that?
- Actually, it's...

455
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:13,090
really hypersensitive on the new
60D model. So you have to...

456
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,357
- Wait. What is that?
- Okay, nope.

457
00:29:14,457 --> 00:29:16,423
- What are you doing?
- Give it back, Malibu Ken.

458
00:29:16,523 --> 00:29:17,891
- No.
- What?

459
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:19,691
You did it. You turned
into one of those people.

460
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:23,490
I turned into one of those people
that gives a shit about something?

461
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:24,990
Are you gonna chain yourself
to a polar bear?

462
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:28,457
Only if you let me borrow...
What is this, a beach sweater?

463
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:31,124
- Yeah.
- What, did you just come from skiing?

464
00:29:31,224 --> 00:29:34,955
Yeah, I skied in,
just to see you save the world.

465
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:37,055
One Jell-O shot at a time.

466
00:29:37,755 --> 00:29:38,856
High-five!

467
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:42,554
- You want me to do your back?
- Only if you promise to do my front first.

468
00:29:42,654 --> 00:29:44,375
Gladly.

469
00:29:47,587 --> 00:29:49,086
That never usually happens.

470
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:51,169
Really? It happens to me all the time.

471
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:53,687
Guess who just took a shit in the water?

472
00:29:53,787 --> 00:29:57,220
We've been looking for you bitches all day.
Where the fuck have you been?

473
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,584
Our car broke down in Orlando.
Do you ever look at your cell phone?

474
00:30:00,684 --> 00:30:03,452
Awesome. Who are these cunt punches?

475
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:06,518
These are our friends
that we met on the way down.

476
00:30:06,618 --> 00:30:09,217
- Yeah.
- That's Cody and Brah.

477
00:30:09,317 --> 00:30:11,351
They're on the lacrosse team at Florida.

478
00:30:11,451 --> 00:30:13,951
- This guy plays lacrosse?
- All-conference, brah!

479
00:30:14,051 --> 00:30:16,884
Yeah? Which one, the fucking
Diabetes Conference?

480
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,250
We're about to boat race
a bunch of those fucks

481
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:23,082
from the University of Georgia
up in the room. So...

482
00:30:23,182 --> 00:30:25,015
Oh, my God! University of Georgia!

483
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:27,549
- No way! You're a Hornet?
- Afraid so.

484
00:30:27,649 --> 00:30:31,316
Well, you guys should get in there then,
Edward Jizzumhands.

485
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:34,714
Well, thank you. We will.

486
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:37,897
Good, that's great. I'll see you up there.

487
00:30:37,997 --> 00:30:40,613
Good. Well, you say
we'll be there and on time.

488
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:43,080
- Sweet. I will.
- Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

489
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,214
- No, we should.
- Let's do it now.

490
00:30:44,314 --> 00:30:48,753
- Yeah, I'll see you up there.
- Come to the hotel. By the pool.

491
00:30:49,213 --> 00:30:51,479
Georgia sucks!

492
00:30:52,246 --> 00:30:54,946
Can we please just go?
They've got boyfriends.

493
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:57,377
Those meatdick fucks?
They're not their boyfriends.

494
00:30:57,477 --> 00:31:00,812
They're just seniors, and they're all just
terrified and speed-fucking each other

495
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:03,244
before the ship goes down.
Didn't you ever go on Spring Break?

496
00:31:03,344 --> 00:31:06,376
No, I didn't go to Spring Break,
'cause I was studying for law school.

497
00:31:06,476 --> 00:31:09,110
Besides, I can't chug alcohol anymore
like I used to, Grandpa.

498
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:11,210
I've developed, like, a gag reflex.

499
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,710
- A gag reflex?
- Yeah.

500
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,177
You're chugging a beer,
not taking down a horse cock, Jason.

501
00:31:16,277 --> 00:31:18,176
Come on.

502
00:31:27,442 --> 00:31:30,107
- Go Hornets!
- Go Hornets, yeah.

503
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:34,039
You know, one in three of these girls
has herpes. Even if you can't see it.

504
00:31:34,139 --> 00:31:37,790
Jesus. Nut the fuck up. It's just
a college party, you nance. Chill!

505
00:31:37,890 --> 00:31:40,273
Hey, here they are.

506
00:31:40,373 --> 00:31:43,072
I'm gonna get some beers.
What about you, twinkle toes?

507
00:31:43,172 --> 00:31:46,071
You want some of that drank?
Some of that purple drank?

508
00:31:46,171 --> 00:31:50,973
Some of that purple-ass muthafuckin'
pimp-dick drank?

509
00:31:51,073 --> 00:31:54,139
Who the fuck are you?

510
00:31:57,637 --> 00:32:00,138
It's a pretty rockin' party.

511
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:05,673
Who let the dogs out? Am I right?

512
00:32:18,652 --> 00:32:22,291
Sir, before we start, would you prefer
if we gave you a spritzer to chug?

513
00:32:22,391 --> 00:32:25,085
Maybe a Pinot Noir?

514
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:32,313
You're going down, old man.
Nobody chugs like me.

515
00:32:32,413 --> 00:32:35,477
I bet. You've been chugging
Brah's cum for years.

516
00:32:38,182 --> 00:32:39,649
Let's go.

517
00:32:43,854 --> 00:32:46,494
Chug! Chug...

518
00:32:51,381 --> 00:32:55,646
Go! Go! Chug!

519
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,773
It's actually kind of fun.

520
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:00,477
Yeah.

521
00:34:00,577 --> 00:34:04,438
I'm not really, you know, for sure,

522
00:34:04,538 --> 00:34:05,772
per say...

523
00:34:05,872 --> 00:34:08,726
what we're doing after graduation.

524
00:34:08,826 --> 00:34:11,771
- I mean, we have offers to play...
- Blah, blah, blah...

525
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:14,008
...professional lacrosse in Europe, but...

526
00:34:14,108 --> 00:34:15,703
- Words, words, words...
- ...a bunch of agents

527
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,070
also want us to start modeling, so...

528
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:21,636
And again, we're talking about
this fat fuck right here?

529
00:34:21,736 --> 00:34:25,271
You guys... you have
to come see this right now.

530
00:34:42,534 --> 00:34:45,166
All right, our team won!

531
00:34:45,266 --> 00:34:49,099
Let's celebrate by buying local drugs

532
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,549
from a reputable, local drug dealer.

533
00:34:52,649 --> 00:34:55,532
Hey, what are you doing here?

534
00:34:55,632 --> 00:34:59,731
I'm selling drugs, man. I'm trying
to put my kid through preschool.

535
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:03,231
- How honest is that!
- Touching my face a lot, bro.

536
00:35:03,331 --> 00:35:06,863
Touching my face a whole lot. Why don't you
take some of this. This'll mellow you out.

537
00:35:06,963 --> 00:35:09,164
- What is it?
- E-cig, bro.

538
00:35:09,264 --> 00:35:13,630
- "E" is for "Weed"!
- Sure, why not?

539
00:35:15,596 --> 00:35:19,178
Yeah, that's a big... that's a big one.

540
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:28,460
Just be glad you didn't smoke this, man.
This is crack!

541
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,528
- What?
- Yeah!

542
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,295
This one... wait a minute...

543
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:37,560
Maybe that one's crack
and this one's weed.

544
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,727
Hang on. What'd you do now, Pam?

545
00:35:39,827 --> 00:35:42,894
Fuck. Hold on. Which one's crack?

546
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,159
Okay. I got this. Don't freak out.

547
00:35:47,259 --> 00:35:50,209
Sorry to worry you, man.
You're not gonna believe this.

548
00:35:50,309 --> 00:35:52,958
- They're both crack.
- What?

549
00:35:53,058 --> 00:35:57,424
And you have taken an amount that will
probably kill you in about 30 minutes.

550
00:35:57,524 --> 00:36:01,390
- I just smoked crack?
- Yeah. But just, like, a lot.

551
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,024
I just smoked crack.

552
00:36:06,157 --> 00:36:08,929
I just smoked crack!

553
00:36:11,488 --> 00:36:16,636
USA! USA! USA! USA!

554
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:19,801
Told you.

555
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,655
He's fine. He's just a little drunk.

556
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,720
Everybody loves crack!

557
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,653
Bee loves crack. Bee loves some crack.

558
00:36:35,053 --> 00:36:37,887
We should probably go help him.

559
00:36:41,084 --> 00:36:43,835
Sting? You're stung!

560
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:48,234
Shit, I just found my queen.

561
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,534
Okay, let's help him.

562
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:57,368
Excuse me. Jason!

563
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:02,450
- Hey, Jason.
- Jason.

564
00:37:03,832 --> 00:37:06,299
- Jason.
- Jason.

565
00:37:13,732 --> 00:37:16,693
I'm gonna live forever!

566
00:37:22,263 --> 00:37:24,330
Party on!

567
00:37:38,641 --> 00:37:40,061
Shit!

568
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:44,394
One, two, three...

569
00:37:44,761 --> 00:37:47,799
- Hello?
- Where the fuck have you been?

570
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:52,060
We got to Grandpa's a little bit later
than we thought last night, and...

571
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,426
and my phone charger wasn't working.

572
00:37:54,526 --> 00:37:58,093
You know we missed the deadline for our
wedding announcement to be in the Times.

573
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,892
Where are you? Are you close?

574
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:04,807
Listen, Grandpa got
really upset last night.

575
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:08,923
So I'm just getting
a little bit of a late jump here.

576
00:38:09,023 --> 00:38:12,092
I want to show you the bouquets for the
bridesmaids. So switch to FaceTime, okay?

577
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:15,490
Shit! Baby, the reception
at Grandpa's isn't very good...

578
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,922
- Jason, just fucking do it!
- Okay, one second. Switching over.

579
00:38:19,022 --> 00:38:21,890
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

580
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,856
Is that sand on your face?

581
00:38:23,956 --> 00:38:26,939
It's just sawdust because I was
helping Grandpa in the garage, so...

582
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,772
I naturally got the dust
of the saw on the face.

583
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:32,506
- Hi, honey.
- Jason.

584
00:38:32,606 --> 00:38:35,238
Mom? Dad?

585
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:38,337
Is that writing on your face?

586
00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:42,205
I was working on my vows
late last night and...

587
00:38:43,068 --> 00:38:46,670
I fell asleep and I got
some pen on my face, so...

588
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:49,202
Yeah, that must be
the exact thing that happened.

589
00:38:49,302 --> 00:38:52,132
Yeah, Meredith called us because
she hadn't heard from you all night.

590
00:38:52,232 --> 00:38:55,602
We got the rabbi here to work on the vows.

591
00:38:56,202 --> 00:38:59,834
- Boker tov, Jason.
- Hey. Shalom.

592
00:38:59,934 --> 00:39:02,811
No, Jason, really...
What is on your forehead?

593
00:39:03,835 --> 00:39:06,999
It's a swastika of penises.

594
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:09,101
- What?
- No, that's not what it is.

595
00:39:09,201 --> 00:39:12,133
Acting as a pinwheel of ejaculate...

596
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,532
No, no, no, it's a FaceTime effect.

597
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:18,666
All the kids are using them these days.
There's a Hanukkah one. See?

598
00:39:20,033 --> 00:39:23,098
I don't like that one as much
as the swastika full of dicks.

599
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:26,165
Okay, let's discuss the wedding vows.

600
00:39:26,265 --> 00:39:29,631
Jason, why don't you begin
by telling us all

601
00:39:29,731 --> 00:39:31,996
what it is you like about Meredith.

602
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,113
Yeah, where do I start? She's...

603
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:37,080
Hello.

604
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,496
- Hello, buzzy bee.
- What?

605
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:45,063
If you can't think of anything,
lean into them looks, dawg.

606
00:39:45,163 --> 00:39:46,661
Can I touch buzzy bee?

607
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:49,895
I've loved her for...
No, you can't touch buzzy bee!

608
00:39:50,195 --> 00:39:52,669
I love the way that she...

609
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:56,595
What are you doing? Stop it! Go away!

610
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:59,277
- You're getting me in... Go away!
- Your buzzy bee looks so fluffy!

611
00:39:59,377 --> 00:40:02,326
- What did he say?
- I just don't know where to start.

612
00:40:02,426 --> 00:40:04,772
- Let me touch buzzy bee!
- You can't have the bee!

613
00:40:04,872 --> 00:40:06,942
- What?
- I want to stroke the bee!

614
00:40:07,042 --> 00:40:09,676
- You can't stroke the bee! Okay?
- I want to kiss buzzy bee!

615
00:40:09,776 --> 00:40:11,759
You can't kiss the bee!

616
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:14,306
I love the way that she kisses.

617
00:40:14,406 --> 00:40:16,265
- Kid! Oh, my God.
- Hey!

618
00:40:16,365 --> 00:40:19,457
- Hey! Fucking pervert!
- I got to go right now. I'm sorry.

619
00:40:19,557 --> 00:40:22,921
- I love you. Bye!
- No, no, no! Jason! Jason!

620
00:40:23,191 --> 00:40:25,258
Come on. I told you to stay with us.

621
00:40:26,923 --> 00:40:29,290
He let me stroke it.

622
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:33,440
Hold on! He's talking about a pee...
A bee. A little stuffed bee.

623
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,790
- What bee?
- There was a bee here, man!

624
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:39,974
- It was so soft. He let me kiss it.
- No, I did not let you kiss it!

625
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:42,755
- What are you talking about? He did not...
- You're fucking dead!

626
00:40:42,955 --> 00:40:45,654
Dad, that was cool!

627
00:40:46,854 --> 00:40:48,687
Shit!

628
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:15,606
May I have some pants? Please...

629
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:19,443
Oh, Jesus Christ, I'm so sorry. Of course.

630
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,746
Yeah, absolutely.

631
00:41:23,046 --> 00:41:25,886
You want khakis or sweatpants?

632
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:30,020
- Khakis, please.
- What brand? You like Docker's?

633
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,856
- Yeah! Yeah!
- Yeah? Okay.

634
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,197
All right. You're like a 30...

635
00:41:36,993 --> 00:41:38,596
Yes, 30 is fine.

636
00:41:38,696 --> 00:41:42,533
What I wouldn't give to fit in a 30.
Maybe 20 years ago, you know.

637
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:44,913
When I was seven years old.

638
00:41:45,835 --> 00:41:47,771
Yeah. All right.

639
00:41:47,871 --> 00:41:51,708
Also, I'm going to step out and get
some lunch. Do you want a sandwich?

640
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:55,679
- I would love a sandwich.
- Ham? Turkey?

641
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,315
Turkey? Turkey.

642
00:41:57,415 --> 00:42:00,717
That's so funny,
because I'm a turkey guy myself, you know.

643
00:42:00,817 --> 00:42:04,121
- Thank you so much.
- Okay. Absolutely want mayo on that?

644
00:42:04,221 --> 00:42:07,558
- No, thank you, no. Extra veggies.
- Okay. Extra veggies?

645
00:42:07,658 --> 00:42:09,559
- Yes, please.
- You got it. Absolutely...

646
00:42:09,659 --> 00:42:12,296
- Salt and vinegar.
- You want salt and vinegar as well?

647
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:15,733
- Yeah, thank you.
- You gotta watch that sodium.

648
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:18,969
Because that's what drives your blood
pressure up. Bood pressure is a silent killer.

649
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:22,773
Turkey. Okay. All right.

650
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:27,177
Yeah. And, finally,
do you want to be sodomized

651
00:42:27,277 --> 00:42:30,781
by a man with the mental age of seven
who calls himself "Ping-pong",

652
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:35,049
or do you want to be shivved
by the... same guy?

653
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:40,075
Just let me know what time works out
for you, 'cause you're in fucking jail.

654
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:48,716
All right. Gary, I'm all done. It's late.
I gotta go open the store, buddy.

655
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,668
I know, but you tried to sell
peyote to middle schoolers.

656
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:55,405
What? Come on, it's me. Pam.

657
00:42:55,605 --> 00:43:00,777
Don't be a dick. Come on! I just had
watery diarrhea. I wanna get out of here.

658
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:03,844
- It stinks!
- It does stink.

659
00:43:04,531 --> 00:43:07,899
- All right, let's get you out of there.
- All right.

660
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:11,322
- I don't like being in a cage.
- Wait, you're letting him out?

661
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,823
He's the one that sold drugs.
Why are you letting him out?

662
00:43:13,923 --> 00:43:17,895
Hey, man! Not cool! That's a real
dick move throwing me under the bus.

663
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,864
What the fuck are you talking about?
You're the one that sold drugs last night.

664
00:43:20,964 --> 00:43:24,402
- Hey, guy. Snitches get stitches!
- All right.

665
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,370
So why don't you shut
your fucking mouth, bro.

666
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,339
Snitches get stitches, my friend.

667
00:43:30,439 --> 00:43:32,477
My name's Pam.

668
00:43:32,577 --> 00:43:35,479
You are just incorrigible.

669
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:37,781
- Hey. How are you, Finch?
- How you doing, hon?

670
00:43:37,881 --> 00:43:40,585
- Good to see you. Hey.
- Finchy. Jean Finch.

671
00:43:40,685 --> 00:43:43,653
- You got it.
- Most beautiful woman on the police force.

672
00:43:43,753 --> 00:43:46,089
Jeez. The only woman...

673
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:47,358
- Here's the deal.
- What's up?

674
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,727
I came in here with a bag of drugs.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

675
00:43:50,827 --> 00:43:53,460
I can't leave without it.

676
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,699
- Can you guys hook me up there?
- Yeah.

677
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,068
- Gary! Yeah.
- These yours?

678
00:43:58,168 --> 00:44:00,971
- Thanks, Gar-bear.
- Oh, nice catch.

679
00:44:01,071 --> 00:44:04,642
Please remember next Tuesday is the election.
Vote for me for mayor.

680
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,802
I'm gonna win this year.
I'm gonna beat that goat.

681
00:44:09,479 --> 00:44:13,250
- Pam! Pam!
- My God. He is just a good one.

682
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,453
- He is the number one...
- Lover and a fighter...

683
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,585
Okay, listen.

684
00:44:18,856 --> 00:44:22,059
Guys, I really respect
the job you guys do.

685
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,194
I'm being completely honest
from the bottom of my heart,

686
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:27,042
I look up to you. I fight for the law.

687
00:44:27,142 --> 00:44:28,966
- Thank you. No one ever says that to us.
- Ever.

688
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:32,887
That's what I wanted to do when I was
a kid. I wanna do what you guys do.

689
00:44:32,987 --> 00:44:37,307
Mostly people just call us pigs
and throw bags of fast food at us.

690
00:44:37,407 --> 00:44:41,891
I'm incredibly sorry for all this confusion,
but listen to me, please, I have to...

691
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:45,983
- let you know I'm a lawyer.
- Wait, you're a lawyer?

692
00:44:46,083 --> 00:44:50,087
- Yeah, I'm actually a lawyer.
- You don't look like a lawyer.

693
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,856
Yeah, I handle, like, corporate stuff.

694
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:56,360
Like, like LLC agreements.

695
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,129
You lost me.
I don't even know what that means.

696
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:02,916
- I mean, you don't look Jewish.
- No.

697
00:45:03,016 --> 00:45:05,849
If you think about it,
it's actually pretty funny.

698
00:45:06,269 --> 00:45:10,564
- Like, ending up here on this side...
- It is. That is funny. It is so weird.

699
00:45:11,088 --> 00:45:15,212
- It's darkly ironic. It really is.
- Yes, exactly. Dark irony.

700
00:45:15,312 --> 00:45:18,515
I thought you had to be,
like, at least 80 to be a lawyer.

701
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:21,518
- Like, it's a lot of school, right?
- Yeah.

702
00:45:21,618 --> 00:45:25,439
It's a lot of school. The bar...

703
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:28,225
It's something I took and passed.

704
00:45:28,325 --> 00:45:30,952
It's not something I stand behind.

705
00:45:31,252 --> 00:45:36,363
Yeah. I'm not on this side, typically,
and I just... I just...

706
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:38,952
I know my rights
and I would love my phone call.

707
00:45:39,052 --> 00:45:40,337
- Objection.
- Overruled.

708
00:45:40,437 --> 00:45:43,506
- Permission to approach the bench.
- Denied!

709
00:45:43,606 --> 00:45:44,574
What?

710
00:45:44,674 --> 00:45:47,057
- It's easy to be a lawyer.
- It's so easy.

711
00:45:47,157 --> 00:45:49,942
I would love my phone call.

712
00:45:50,647 --> 00:45:53,350
Okay? I know my rights.
I want my phone call.

713
00:45:54,250 --> 00:45:56,353
- Give me my phone call.
- I should have a phone...

714
00:45:56,453 --> 00:45:58,171
This is my First Amendment right.

715
00:45:58,271 --> 00:46:03,493
First and foremost... Page one, number one...
amendment says that I get my telephone.

716
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:04,495
This is my First Amendment right.

717
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,697
I don't think you understand
that I'm guaranteed a phone call.

718
00:46:07,797 --> 00:46:11,268
- I don't sound like that.
- Yeah? What do you sound like then?

719
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,967
Not like that.
I don't think I sound like that.

720
00:46:15,572 --> 00:46:16,740
Give me my phone call.

721
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,510
- Please, will you let me have my phone call?
- ...phone call.

722
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,313
I'm an American
and I'm fucking guaranteed...

723
00:46:23,413 --> 00:46:26,400
I'm an American.
I am guaranteed a phone call.

724
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:29,910
Legally, it's my right
to have a phone call.

725
00:46:31,813 --> 00:46:35,192
I just said I'm an American
and I'm guaranteed a phone call.

726
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:39,196
Well, now he's getting demanding.
We better give him his phone call.

727
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,965
- Better give him his phone call.
- Guys, come on. Come on, please.

728
00:46:43,065 --> 00:46:46,403
- Why are we doing this?
- This is your phone right here, right?

729
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,407
- That is my phone. Yes.
- Well, you know what?

730
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:51,975
We get to make
one phone call on your phone.

731
00:46:52,075 --> 00:46:53,744
That's where you're
just a little bit mixed up.

732
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,046
Yeah. Hopefully, you're not
out of "framily" minutes.

733
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,181
- No, no, no, no, no...
- We get a free Uber ride on that.

734
00:46:58,281 --> 00:46:59,750
Take us out to lunch.

735
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,020
Hey, you know what? We're gonna be kind
and set you up with a Tinder account too.

736
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:05,420
- How about Grindr. What about...
- Look at this, look at this.

737
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,125
- "Jefe", is that how you pronounce that?
- Yeah, how about Jefe?

738
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,027
Little alone time with Jefe?

739
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:13,647
He'd like some light conversation
and heavy petting, flirting...

740
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,340
- Flirtations.
- He looks thick and lonely.

741
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:20,901
You'll meet him at 8:00.
You'll bring wine coolers. And...

742
00:47:21,805 --> 00:47:24,065
Children's condoms.

743
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:27,780
- Just gonna take a little picture.
- Snatch-chat.

744
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,830
- Please don't do that with my phone.
- Hope you got a wide angle lens on that.

745
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:36,984
Kidding.

746
00:47:38,322 --> 00:47:41,589
Somebody just posted his bail.
Get that pervert some pants.

747
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:45,362
All right.
These were a couple pair of pants

748
00:47:45,462 --> 00:47:50,300
from murder victims
from a 1990s orgy gone bad.

749
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,603
We got semen-stained or blood-stained.

750
00:47:53,703 --> 00:47:56,123
Take your pick. What's it gonna be?

751
00:47:57,274 --> 00:47:59,274
- Blood.
- Semen it is.

752
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:04,796
- Hey, there he is.
- No.

753
00:48:04,996 --> 00:48:07,029
Don't even fucking talk to me.

754
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:10,971
I know things got a little chaotic,
but I'm so close with Lenore...

755
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:15,311
What the fuck is wrong with you?
I'm about to get fucking married, Grandpa!

756
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:19,345
In one week! To a Jewish girl!
And I just woke up in fucking jail

757
00:48:19,445 --> 00:48:22,210
with a bunch of penises on my forehead

758
00:48:22,310 --> 00:48:24,839
in the shape of a swastika!

759
00:48:25,109 --> 00:48:27,410
Could call it a swasticock.

760
00:48:28,544 --> 00:48:30,676
- What?
- It's a play on words.

761
00:48:30,776 --> 00:48:33,292
It's a play on words.

762
00:48:33,392 --> 00:48:35,626
A play on words.

763
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,175
Play on these words.

764
00:48:38,275 --> 00:48:41,907
I'm dropping you off
at your old army vet buddy's house,

765
00:48:42,007 --> 00:48:46,775
he's gonna drive you to fucking Boca.
Because I'm fucking done with you.

766
00:48:49,106 --> 00:48:53,325
- What the fuck are you looking at?
- I can't help staring at your tits.

767
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:57,627
What the fuck is wrong with you?

768
00:49:01,226 --> 00:49:06,372
You know, Stinky had more confirmed kills
than anyone in our platoon back in 'Nam?

769
00:49:06,472 --> 00:49:09,786
- 118.
- Shut the fuck up.

770
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:13,475
- What is this place?
- I don't know. Or care.

771
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:17,024
At least just come in with me.
Let's make sure it's the right house.

772
00:49:17,124 --> 00:49:19,192
After you.

773
00:49:19,492 --> 00:49:21,150
Grandson of the year.

774
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:24,724
Your grandmother's ashes are in there.

775
00:49:26,757 --> 00:49:28,524
She's in a coffin. Fuck you!

776
00:49:31,058 --> 00:49:34,057
Well, better late than never.

777
00:49:34,157 --> 00:49:36,924
Yeah! Fuck them up, ALF!

778
00:49:37,024 --> 00:49:39,058
Motherfucker!

779
00:49:39,558 --> 00:49:40,824
Stinky?

780
00:49:40,924 --> 00:49:43,392
What the fuck are you doing here, Dick?

781
00:49:45,208 --> 00:49:47,223
This?

782
00:49:47,323 --> 00:49:49,890
This is liver failure.

783
00:49:51,856 --> 00:49:55,055
- Who's the lesbian?
- That's my grandson, Jason.

784
00:49:55,555 --> 00:49:59,072
Yeah? Is he here to scissor with me?

785
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:01,057
Okay, that's just offensive to lesbians.

786
00:50:01,157 --> 00:50:04,540
I am very sorry, K.D. Lang.

787
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:06,355
Time for Bingo!

788
00:50:06,455 --> 00:50:09,871
Come on. Stinky, we got to get you
the fuck out of here. Come on, let's go.

789
00:50:09,971 --> 00:50:13,223
I have one fucking month left, Dick!

790
00:50:13,323 --> 00:50:16,356
I don't want you
to remember me like this, man.

791
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:18,555
I want you to remember me as a warrior.

792
00:50:18,655 --> 00:50:20,988
- Please. Leave me be.
- But, Stinky...

793
00:50:21,088 --> 00:50:24,087
No, no, no... just let me finish, Dick.

794
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,320
Leave me your beautiful lesbian grandson

795
00:50:27,420 --> 00:50:30,135
so he can blowjob me to death.

796
00:50:33,121 --> 00:50:35,787
It's all over for me, Dick.

797
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:40,620
You know, all I wanna do is... play Bingo.

798
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,789
Go.

799
00:50:44,154 --> 00:50:46,021
All ready?

800
00:50:48,987 --> 00:50:50,863
Bingo!

801
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,221
I'm sorry about your friend, Grandpa.

802
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:02,853
So it comes to this.

803
00:51:04,152 --> 00:51:06,407
Even before you die...

804
00:51:06,507 --> 00:51:11,106
you just stop living, and it's all one
fucked-up facsimile of the real thing.

805
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:19,051
We have to go back.

806
00:51:19,151 --> 00:51:21,419
Yeah. I know.

807
00:51:21,952 --> 00:51:26,386
- I'll drive us home.
- Not Atlanta. Daytona.

808
00:51:27,686 --> 00:51:29,951
- What?
- I have to fuck that girl, Jason.

809
00:51:30,051 --> 00:51:33,451
- Jesus, Grandpa!
- I do. I have to fuck her!

810
00:51:33,551 --> 00:51:37,951
Grandpa, you're just depressed. You're
confused right now because of Grandma.

811
00:51:38,051 --> 00:51:40,372
- Grandma wanted me to do this.
- What?

812
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:42,851
Yeah. She said when she died,
she wanted me to move on

813
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:45,885
and live my life the way I wanted to,
and right now, you know what I want to do?

814
00:51:45,985 --> 00:51:48,851
I want to get my dick sucked
by that fucking college girl!

815
00:51:48,951 --> 00:51:52,140
What is that going to do for you?
Is that going to make you feel young again?

816
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,285
- Yeah! Yeah, what's wrong with that?
- Yeah?

817
00:51:55,385 --> 00:51:59,284
Feeling young again? What do I have?
A dead wife, dying friends.

818
00:51:59,384 --> 00:52:01,951
A few fucking good years left
if I'm lucky.

819
00:52:02,051 --> 00:52:05,549
And you know what?
It fucking freaks me out!

820
00:52:05,649 --> 00:52:07,517
Yeah.

821
00:52:08,815 --> 00:52:12,282
Look, I don't expect you to understand.
You're young.

822
00:52:12,382 --> 00:52:15,583
You have a long, long time
before you have to look into that abyss.

823
00:52:15,683 --> 00:52:20,016
But the way I see it, having sex
with that girl is my last stand.

824
00:52:20,116 --> 00:52:22,982
And I can't do it without you.
So I'm asking you.

825
00:52:23,082 --> 00:52:27,783
Please, Jason, just stay
one more day so I can do this.

826
00:52:29,249 --> 00:52:31,084
Please.

827
00:52:35,549 --> 00:52:39,981
Okay, Daytona Beach!
Who's ready for a Flex Off!

828
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:45,481
I'm talking about dudes getting
on stage, getting ripped!

829
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:46,847
Yeah!

830
00:52:46,947 --> 00:52:49,914
Yes, I'll be home tomorrow. I promise.

831
00:52:50,314 --> 00:52:52,614
And I know... I know the dinner
is important to the firm...

832
00:52:52,714 --> 00:52:56,480
Hold on, I'm getting another call.
It might be Meredith. Okay? Bye.

833
00:52:56,946 --> 00:52:58,414
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

834
00:52:58,514 --> 00:53:02,147
- Someone just stuck their thumb up my ass.
- What?

835
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:04,346
Yeah, I was just standing right there,
talking on the phone,

836
00:53:04,446 --> 00:53:07,813
and someone came right up behind me
and stuck their thumb up my ass.

837
00:53:07,913 --> 00:53:09,881
- Did you see who it was...
- Jamba!

838
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:13,114
- Fuck! Stop doing that!
- How'd it go on the home front?

839
00:53:13,214 --> 00:53:16,562
- How do you think?
- Come on. Let's go.

840
00:53:16,662 --> 00:53:18,631
Come on.

841
00:53:19,312 --> 00:53:21,978
Top Gun in the house!

842
00:53:22,078 --> 00:53:25,645
We got Maverick! We got Fat Goose!

843
00:53:26,445 --> 00:53:29,912
- Do we have a challenger?
- Right here! Right here!

844
00:53:30,012 --> 00:53:32,445
- These two! She wants to!
- These two.

845
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:35,128
- Pick her!
- Who will accept this challenge?

846
00:53:35,228 --> 00:53:38,012
You go up there, I'll let you do
whatever you want to me tonight.

847
00:53:38,112 --> 00:53:39,979
- All right, I'm doing it.
- All right!

848
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:41,945
What?

849
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:43,978
- No, no, no!
- Are you kidding me?

850
00:53:44,078 --> 00:53:46,511
I saw your body last night,
it's a lot better than Cody's.

851
00:53:46,611 --> 00:53:49,944
And my body sure as shit looks better
than that fucking Shamu's up there.

852
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:53,944
- There's like 1,000 people out here!
- A lost old man has wandered on stage.

853
00:53:54,044 --> 00:53:57,227
- Are you his nurse?
- No. Fuck no.

854
00:53:57,327 --> 00:54:00,094
Get on stage! Get on stage...

855
00:54:05,810 --> 00:54:07,843
Do it for me!

856
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:14,443
So we have team Top Gun

857
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:18,911
versus creepy old guy
and his lesbian daughter.

858
00:54:19,794 --> 00:54:24,241
Okay, Daytona Beach,
are you ready to Flex Off?

859
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:27,077
Three! Two! One!

860
00:54:27,177 --> 00:54:28,984
Flex!

861
00:54:29,477 --> 00:54:32,410
Having trouble getting
that coat off, Fat Goose?

862
00:54:34,141 --> 00:54:36,176
Look at this guy!

863
00:54:36,276 --> 00:54:38,776
He's like Mother Teresa's vagina!

864
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:41,075
Old and tight!

865
00:54:41,775 --> 00:54:45,642
Hey, look, it's Cirque du So Gay!

866
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:48,442
What now?

867
00:54:50,308 --> 00:54:53,392
- Has the old man fallen? Or is it...
- What the fuck?

868
00:54:53,742 --> 00:54:57,576
One-armed motherfucking push-ups!
Holy shit!

869
00:54:57,676 --> 00:54:59,775
Lesbian daughter's
getting in on the action!

870
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:02,774
I happen to know
he smoked crack last night!

871
00:55:02,874 --> 00:55:06,073
These push-ups are fuelled
by the devil's candy!

872
00:55:06,173 --> 00:55:08,708
Unbelievable!

873
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:12,540
Your move, Dolly Parton.

874
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,874
What are you gonna do now, team Top Gun?

875
00:55:16,241 --> 00:55:20,173
And, hey, everybody, don't forget to stop
by Tam Pam Surf Slam in town

876
00:55:20,273 --> 00:55:24,307
where I'm selling "beach towels"
for 50 bucks an ounce.

877
00:55:24,407 --> 00:55:28,340
"Sun screen" for 10 bucks a dime bag.

878
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,906
And I'm also selling meth!

879
00:55:33,107 --> 00:55:35,173
Just got married!

880
00:55:35,273 --> 00:55:40,439
- Your move, Viagra Falls.
- Crowd going wild for team Top Gun!

881
00:55:41,206 --> 00:55:43,656
Grandpa, I got this. Watch.

882
00:55:43,756 --> 00:55:47,423
Most muscular, on three. One, two, three.

883
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,138
I think this guy just sharted!

884
00:55:53,238 --> 00:55:54,705
- No, I didn't!
- Yes!

885
00:55:54,805 --> 00:55:57,880
Call a lifeguard, I think
there's been a shart attack!

886
00:56:08,104 --> 00:56:11,058
I'm not even holding the mic right now.

887
00:56:13,236 --> 00:56:15,370
You suck!

888
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:19,671
I have an idea. Do you remember that thing
we used to do when I was a kid?

889
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:21,538
Yeah.

890
00:56:22,638 --> 00:56:27,137
- One, two, three...
- Hold on, what's this?

891
00:56:27,237 --> 00:56:31,786
What is going on?
Oh, my God, what am I seeing?

892
00:56:33,437 --> 00:56:36,937
Am I on drugs? Of course I am!

893
00:56:37,037 --> 00:56:41,551
But this is still incredible!
Flex Off history is being made!

894
00:56:42,071 --> 00:56:45,703
- What's up now, Brah?
- Yeah, what's up now, Brah?

895
00:56:45,803 --> 00:56:50,398
- Yeah, what's up now, Brah?
- 'Sup now, Brah? 'Sup now, Brah...

896
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:55,236
This is incredible! Take out your cameras!

897
00:56:55,336 --> 00:56:58,403
Put this online! This shit is going viral!

898
00:56:59,003 --> 00:57:00,968
Shit. Let me down.

899
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:03,069
Did everybody get a picture of that?

900
00:57:03,969 --> 00:57:06,304
- What the fuck are you doing?
- I can't do this...

901
00:57:06,404 --> 00:57:07,488
- What?
- God...

902
00:57:07,588 --> 00:57:11,903
The winners Of the Alpha Delta Flex Off...
Wait a minute! Where are you going?

903
00:57:12,003 --> 00:57:13,635
- Guys?
- Where are you going?

904
00:57:13,735 --> 00:57:15,602
- Jason!
- You can't just leave me here like this.

905
00:57:15,702 --> 00:57:18,468
- Why'd you stop? We were winning!
- Because I'm a lawyer!

906
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:20,601
I can't have people taking pictures
of me doing stuff like this.

907
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:22,901
Can you imagine if the firm
saw something like that?

908
00:57:23,001 --> 00:57:26,399
By default, the winner
of the Flex Off is...

909
00:57:26,499 --> 00:57:30,035
- Bring the cup home, baby!
- ...these two dildos.

910
00:57:31,617 --> 00:57:35,183
Every single day, my career's in jeop...
What are you doing?

911
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:38,817
I'm taking the regulator off
in the pneumatic propulsion system.

912
00:57:39,450 --> 00:57:43,385
- Give me a beer.
- What did you really do for the army?

913
00:57:43,784 --> 00:57:46,683
- I told you, I was a mechanic.
- Bullshit.

914
00:57:46,783 --> 00:57:50,150
You speak Arabic.
You hotwired a golf cart.

915
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:54,482
- Tell me the truth.
- All right, I was Special Forces.

916
00:57:54,582 --> 00:57:57,448
I trained insurgents behind
enemy lines from Vietnam to Iraq.

917
00:57:57,548 --> 00:58:00,716
Now give me the fucking beer can! Come on!

918
00:58:00,816 --> 00:58:04,315
Look at this dummy! What an idiot!

919
00:58:10,315 --> 00:58:12,682
Yeah! Do it again!

920
00:58:12,782 --> 00:58:15,149
We can change in Cody's room.
I picked his pocket earlier.

921
00:58:15,249 --> 00:58:19,267
Nothing to see here, guys.
Cops are gonna come pretty quick.

922
00:58:21,099 --> 00:58:23,665
No, no, this is his father,
so that's what I'm saying.

923
00:58:23,765 --> 00:58:27,998
Keep him heavily sedated, but don't be
afraid to pull the plug if you have to.

924
00:58:28,098 --> 00:58:30,431
Thank you, Doctor.

925
00:58:30,864 --> 00:58:34,013
Okay.
They're in the hospital till tomorrow.

926
00:58:34,113 --> 00:58:36,573
The room's ours for the night.

927
00:58:37,396 --> 00:58:41,330
Look at these fucking people.
How was brunch at Hitler's house that day?

928
00:58:41,430 --> 00:58:46,929
Hey, Grandpa, who else in our family knows
that you were Special Forces or whatever?

929
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:49,314
No one, once your grandmother passed.

930
00:58:49,414 --> 00:58:52,263
Your father stopped talking to me
before my missions were declassified.

931
00:58:52,363 --> 00:58:56,131
So he always thought
I was just an army mechanic.

932
00:58:56,231 --> 00:59:01,230
But don't you think that you guys would
get along a little better if you told him?

933
00:59:03,429 --> 00:59:06,963
Hey, come on.
Let's see how you look. Come on out.

934
00:59:10,962 --> 00:59:14,529
First of all,
nobody wears a fucking white belt.

935
00:59:14,629 --> 00:59:17,511
The only people who wear white belts
are people who suck at karate

936
00:59:17,611 --> 00:59:21,061
and people who suck at life.
Take the fucking belt off.

937
00:59:21,161 --> 00:59:25,328
And you better lose that fucking white
polo shirt and those pleated khaki pants.

938
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:29,161
You're meeting up with girls, not blowing
an oil executive on a fucking golf course.

939
00:59:29,261 --> 00:59:31,462
Put these on.

940
00:59:32,629 --> 00:59:35,828
Well, in case you forgot, I don't
even have underwear, from last night.

941
00:59:35,928 --> 00:59:38,962
All right, just put them on.
I'll turn around.

942
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,926
- Nice dick.
- Jeez, Grandpa.

943
00:59:43,026 --> 00:59:45,228
That's a good dick.
You got your grandpa's dick.

944
00:59:45,328 --> 00:59:48,828
Not the girth, not the length,
but same style.

945
00:59:49,526 --> 00:59:52,226
- That's good to know.
- You're lucky you're not your dad.

946
00:59:52,326 --> 00:59:55,794
- He's got his mom's dick.
- What the fuck?

947
00:59:55,894 --> 00:59:57,695
Now put your pants on.

948
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:15,924
- Shit. It's Meredith.
- Don't answer it.

949
01:00:16,024 --> 01:00:18,955
- My rehearsal brunch is this weekend.
- No calls.

950
01:00:19,055 --> 01:00:22,259
For one night, stop worrying
about your wedding. Please.

951
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:26,192
We have two hot, smart, beautiful college
girls at the peak of their sexual powers

952
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:29,392
about to meet us at one
of the last great nightclubs in Florida.

953
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:31,793
Worry about them.

954
01:00:34,224 --> 01:00:35,960
Okay.

955
01:00:55,256 --> 01:00:57,423
I don't think you're very
popular here, Grandpa.

956
01:00:57,523 --> 01:01:00,024
You're the one that's going
to have to watch out.

957
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:02,224
You might get Oreo'd.

958
01:01:02,324 --> 01:01:03,389
Oreo'd?

959
01:01:03,489 --> 01:01:07,728
That's when two black guys fuck a white guy.
You're the cream in the middle.

960
01:01:20,324 --> 01:01:22,190
Game on.

961
01:01:22,756 --> 01:01:26,756
Hey! Glad you guys made it.
Let's go get fucked up. Right?

962
01:01:26,856 --> 01:01:29,436
My stepdad hates me!

963
01:01:30,456 --> 01:01:31,890
Let's go!

964
01:01:40,822 --> 01:01:43,488
Party till you're pregnant!

965
01:01:45,922 --> 01:01:49,088
Oh, my God, I love this song!

966
01:01:49,587 --> 01:01:52,199
- You're not gonna die on me, are you?
- I don't think so.

967
01:01:52,299 --> 01:01:54,155
All right!

968
01:02:00,886 --> 01:02:03,888
- Come on.
- No. No.

969
01:02:35,118 --> 01:02:38,185
You want it? Come here, give me that hat!

970
01:02:39,353 --> 01:02:41,653
Oh, my God.

971
01:02:43,618 --> 01:02:47,918
- Give me that! What is this?
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey.

972
01:02:48,018 --> 01:02:50,752
Leave my illegitimate black son alone.

973
01:02:50,852 --> 01:02:53,185
We were just asking him to dance.

974
01:02:53,285 --> 01:02:56,352
- Well, he don't wanna dance.
- Well, maybe you wanna dance instead.

975
01:02:56,452 --> 01:02:58,784
- I don't wanna dance...
- Colonel Sanders!

976
01:02:58,884 --> 01:03:02,552
It's all right. It's all right.
Let's not dirty this place up.

977
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:06,019
It's a shrine.
Sinatra sang here. Parking lot?

978
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:13,617
It'll be fine.

979
01:03:13,717 --> 01:03:17,251
How is this going to be fine?
Look at this crew.

980
01:03:17,717 --> 01:03:20,417
Come on. We have a good crew too.

981
01:03:20,817 --> 01:03:23,050
We have no crew.

982
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,783
We have no crew.

983
01:03:24,883 --> 01:03:28,332
Are we going to J.Crew? Fuck J.Crew.

984
01:03:31,157 --> 01:03:32,549
- Don't do this.
- I think...

985
01:03:32,649 --> 01:03:35,699
I'm going to have to fight them all, so you're
going to have to take the first punch.

986
01:03:35,799 --> 01:03:38,507
- What?
- Okay! He's up first.

987
01:03:38,934 --> 01:03:41,000
Whatever.

988
01:03:41,100 --> 01:03:44,014
- You like that shit, white boy?
- Dude, what the fuck is wrong with you?

989
01:03:44,114 --> 01:03:47,762
- What? You want next, bitch?
- Hey...

990
01:03:47,862 --> 01:03:49,784
I thought I had next.

991
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:08,699
Tell him you're sorry
you made fun of him for being gay.

992
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:11,699
I'm sorry I made fun of you for being gay!

993
01:04:11,799 --> 01:04:13,998
Tell him you were raised
in a different era,

994
01:04:14,098 --> 01:04:18,297
but now you know it's wrong to judge
people based on their sexual orientation

995
01:04:18,397 --> 01:04:21,429
and that if you had to be gay
with someone for some reason,

996
01:04:21,529 --> 01:04:25,630
you know, to prevent a terrorist attack
or something, it would be with him.

997
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,697
What?

998
01:04:27,797 --> 01:04:29,663
Say it.

999
01:04:29,963 --> 01:04:34,064
If I had to be gay with somebody

1000
01:04:34,164 --> 01:04:38,948
to prevent a terrorist attack,
it would be you!

1001
01:04:40,463 --> 01:04:42,729
Apology accepted.

1002
01:04:42,829 --> 01:04:44,696
Okay.

1003
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:48,364
Get out of here before I use my other arm.

1004
01:04:51,128 --> 01:04:53,423
This ain't over.

1005
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:57,895
Now fuck off and take Jodeci with you.

1006
01:04:58,495 --> 01:05:00,295
Let's roll.

1007
01:05:04,361 --> 01:05:07,594
It's too bad Lenore
barfed all over herself tonight.

1008
01:05:07,694 --> 01:05:10,128
I definitely could have had sex with her.

1009
01:05:10,228 --> 01:05:11,762
Yup.

1010
01:05:11,862 --> 01:05:15,361
I probably could have still had sex
if she just threw up on her front,

1011
01:05:15,461 --> 01:05:19,728
but she somehow got it all over her back,
and I would have felt bad.

1012
01:05:19,828 --> 01:05:22,729
Well, chivalry isn't dead.

1013
01:05:23,029 --> 01:05:25,494
I like the way you took
that haymaker tonight.

1014
01:05:25,594 --> 01:05:28,794
Sometimes you just gotta take
that punch up front, you know?

1015
01:05:28,894 --> 01:05:31,761
Then things get easier in the long run.

1016
01:05:35,794 --> 01:05:40,084
"De Oppresso Liber." It's written
on your knife too. What does that mean?

1017
01:05:40,694 --> 01:05:44,726
Hey, lights out after 12:00, boys.

1018
01:05:44,826 --> 01:05:48,459
I better not catch you swimming
across the lake to the girls' camp, okay?

1019
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:51,126
- Night.
- Good night.

1020
01:05:56,326 --> 01:05:59,159
You know, maybe I'll find something to do
with Shadia tomorrow

1021
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:02,827
and give you and Lenore
a little more alone time.

1022
01:06:06,525 --> 01:06:08,791
I kind of feel like
we're just getting in your way.

1023
01:06:08,891 --> 01:06:10,492
Yeah?

1024
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:15,559
I'm sure there's something...
What the fuck? Did you just get naked?

1025
01:06:15,759 --> 01:06:18,892
- It's the best way to sleep.
- Oh, my God!

1026
01:06:19,091 --> 01:06:21,691
I picked it up in Uganda from the Umbatdo.

1027
01:06:21,791 --> 01:06:26,115
Umbat-don't let your junk touch my leg
again or you're sleeping on the floor.

1028
01:06:27,025 --> 01:06:28,892
Night.

1029
01:06:29,492 --> 01:06:31,359
Night.

1030
01:06:42,324 --> 01:06:44,157
Jason...

1031
01:06:45,606 --> 01:06:47,574
The fuck! Oh, my God!

1032
01:06:53,722 --> 01:06:55,890
What do these guys want to cut
all the trees down for anyway?

1033
01:06:55,990 --> 01:06:59,622
For some stupid, like, massive,
tacky entertainment complex.

1034
01:06:59,722 --> 01:07:03,089
You know, the ones with, like, arcades
and laser tag. That sort of thing.

1035
01:07:03,189 --> 01:07:04,541
- Laser tag?
- Yeah.

1036
01:07:04,641 --> 01:07:07,755
- I love laser tag. When does it open?
- Nice. Thanks a lot.

1037
01:07:07,855 --> 01:07:09,222
- Shadia!
- Hi, Griz.

1038
01:07:09,322 --> 01:07:12,790
Oh, my God, your pics
from the Boston rally look amazing!

1039
01:07:12,890 --> 01:07:14,922
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Absolutely.

1040
01:07:15,022 --> 01:07:16,788
Sweet Hacky Sack, man.

1041
01:07:16,888 --> 01:07:19,022
It's not a Hacky Sack, dawg.
That's the trade name.

1042
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,556
It's an organic hemp-seed foot satchel.

1043
01:07:21,656 --> 01:07:24,222
And what's someone from the fucking
laser tag lobby doing here?

1044
01:07:24,322 --> 01:07:27,254
- No, I'm just a friend of Shadia's.
- Just my friend.

1045
01:07:27,354 --> 01:07:29,189
That's pretty cool, man.
What is that, a dance ball?

1046
01:07:29,289 --> 01:07:31,321
Fuck! What the fuck?

1047
01:07:31,421 --> 01:07:35,555
- You're fucking kidding me.
- It's like a... What the fuck!

1048
01:07:35,655 --> 01:07:38,955
It's a 4-inch acrylic juggling orb! Dick.

1049
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,654
I'll see you guys next weekend.

1050
01:07:41,754 --> 01:07:46,584
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
- Yeah? Okay. Bye. Bye.

1051
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,921
Hey, Griz...

1052
01:07:52,420 --> 01:07:55,286
- Don't touch that, it's from Laser Tag.
- Sorry.

1053
01:07:55,386 --> 01:07:58,846
- They're good people. I swear.
- Let me see that.

1054
01:07:58,946 --> 01:08:00,352
Where are you going
with these "good people"?

1055
01:08:00,452 --> 01:08:04,519
We're heading out to the coast
to... charter a boat for the year.

1056
01:08:04,619 --> 01:08:06,186
- For the year?
- Yeah.

1057
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:07,352
To do what?

1058
01:08:07,452 --> 01:08:11,186
We're documenting the effects
of climate change out on the ocean.

1059
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:14,521
Aren't you supposed
to graduate next weekend?

1060
01:08:15,353 --> 01:08:16,787
Yeah.

1061
01:08:19,487 --> 01:08:22,220
Seems to me like
you're running from something.

1062
01:08:23,118 --> 01:08:27,151
Come on, haven't you had to make sacrifices
to get where you are as a photographer?

1063
01:08:27,251 --> 01:08:29,518
I mean, yeah, but...

1064
01:08:30,384 --> 01:08:32,185
That's different.

1065
01:08:33,385 --> 01:08:35,286
Look at this.

1066
01:08:40,185 --> 01:08:42,519
I hate photos of myself.

1067
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:46,352
Why? You look beautiful.

1068
01:08:48,318 --> 01:08:50,151
See?

1069
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:05,883
Hey.

1070
01:09:06,383 --> 01:09:08,711
Wait, just calm down.

1071
01:09:08,811 --> 01:09:12,049
- What?
- Shit. Yeah, we'll be right there.

1072
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:14,799
- What's going on?
- We gotta go.

1073
01:09:14,899 --> 01:09:18,216
And then I came back from the bathroom
and all those black guys from the club

1074
01:09:18,316 --> 01:09:21,603
were, like, standing around Lenore and
Dr. Richards and they were yelling at them

1075
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:24,616
and threatening them
and they, like, kidnapped them!

1076
01:09:24,716 --> 01:09:27,516
- And I think one of them had a gun!
- Did you see where they took them?

1077
01:09:27,616 --> 01:09:31,183
No. Those guys are staying at The Tillman.
That's all I know.

1078
01:09:31,283 --> 01:09:33,583
- Okay.
- Come on!

1079
01:09:33,683 --> 01:09:35,416
- Come on!
- Shit!

1080
01:09:40,214 --> 01:09:42,048
What?

1081
01:09:42,648 --> 01:09:44,723
I smell marijuana.

1082
01:09:48,881 --> 01:09:51,814
- What are you going to do with a bucket?
- I don't know!

1083
01:09:51,914 --> 01:09:55,015
Okay, on three. Ready?

1084
01:09:55,115 --> 01:09:58,782
One, two, three!

1085
01:09:59,415 --> 01:10:01,415
Okay, let me try one more time.

1086
01:10:01,515 --> 01:10:05,547
The GZA, the RZA...

1087
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:09,280
- Ol' Dirty Bastard.
- What's going on?

1088
01:10:09,380 --> 01:10:12,946
- Gang stuff.
- Raekwon the Chef!

1089
01:10:13,046 --> 01:10:16,481
And the Method Man!

1090
01:10:18,613 --> 01:10:22,012
Hey! Here they are! How was the protest?

1091
01:10:22,112 --> 01:10:25,797
- It was good.
- Yeah, it was good.

1092
01:10:25,997 --> 01:10:30,092
This is Lamar, Lil' Chris, Big Chris,
Murray Finkelstein.

1093
01:10:30,192 --> 01:10:33,530
And, of course,
you've already met Ty-rizone.

1094
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:35,097
That nigga's crazy, man.

1095
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:37,812
What's with the N-word, anyway?
I can say it. I can't say it...

1096
01:10:37,912 --> 01:10:41,212
- You can say it when we let you say it.
- Which is never.

1097
01:10:41,312 --> 01:10:44,513
Just never say that
under any circumstances.

1098
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:56,944
What the fuck is going on?
I thought these guys wanted to kill you!

1099
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,679
Lebanese Red.

1100
01:10:59,779 --> 01:11:02,144
I had some of this left over
from my time in the Middle East.

1101
01:11:02,244 --> 01:11:06,610
You throw some of this shit around, you can
really get away with anything. Have some.

1102
01:11:06,710 --> 01:11:10,678
You're smoking grass now?
Jesus, this is a gateway drug, Grandpa.

1103
01:11:10,778 --> 01:11:13,011
Yeah, well, you just opened
the gateway to being a pussy.

1104
01:11:13,111 --> 01:11:15,743
- Take some.
- Yo, D. Let's fucking bounce!

1105
01:11:15,843 --> 01:11:19,646
- Let's fucking bounce!
- Where?

1106
01:11:20,793 --> 01:11:22,743
And everything is alright

1107
01:11:22,843 --> 01:11:27,152
I got a beep from Kim,
and she can fuck all night

1108
01:11:27,252 --> 01:11:29,691
Called up the homies and I'm askin y'all

1109
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:32,528
Which park are y'all playin basketball?

1110
01:11:32,928 --> 01:11:35,487
Get me on the court and I'm trouble

1111
01:11:35,587 --> 01:11:38,714
Last week fucked around
and got a triple double

1112
01:11:39,309 --> 01:11:42,375
- Can I say it? Can I say it?
- No! No, no.

1113
01:11:42,475 --> 01:11:44,176
- Say it!
- Say that shit!

1114
01:11:44,276 --> 01:11:47,918
Freakin' niggaz everyway like M.J.

1115
01:11:50,107 --> 01:11:53,476
I can't believe, today was a good day

1116
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:55,741
I'm totally gonna fuck him tonight.

1117
01:11:55,841 --> 01:11:59,275
Can I watch? 'Cause I kind
of want to fuck him too now.

1118
01:12:00,575 --> 01:12:04,566
Drop the mic, baby! Drop the mic, baby!
That's what I'm talking about!

1119
01:12:04,666 --> 01:12:07,364
- Peace out, niggas!
- I see you, boy.

1120
01:12:07,464 --> 01:12:09,333
Nasty!

1121
01:12:11,265 --> 01:12:13,362
Up next we have...

1122
01:12:13,462 --> 01:12:16,430
- Shadia and Jason!
- Yep, that's us now.

1123
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,363
What? No. No, no, no, no.

1124
01:12:19,463 --> 01:12:20,596
- No.
- Come on.

1125
01:12:20,696 --> 01:12:23,663
We can't top that.
I don't want to do this.

1126
01:12:23,763 --> 01:12:28,677
You know the song.
You know every word. See?

1127
01:12:28,777 --> 01:12:30,993
You're going to make me do it all alone?

1128
01:12:31,093 --> 01:12:32,927
Fine.

1129
01:12:34,259 --> 01:12:35,838
Hey.

1130
01:12:35,938 --> 01:12:39,617
For all those times you stood by me

1131
01:12:39,717 --> 01:12:43,323
For all the truth that you made me see

1132
01:12:43,423 --> 01:12:47,205
For all the joy you brought to my life

1133
01:12:47,305 --> 01:12:50,938
For all the wrong that you made right

1134
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:54,934
For every dream you made come true

1135
01:12:55,034 --> 01:12:59,235
For all the love I found in you

1136
01:12:59,335 --> 01:13:03,381
I'll be forever thankful, baby

1137
01:13:03,581 --> 01:13:07,316
You're the one who held me up

1138
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:11,268
And never let me fall, yeah

1139
01:13:11,368 --> 01:13:14,978
You're the one who saw me through

1140
01:13:15,078 --> 01:13:17,215
Through it all

1141
01:13:17,315 --> 01:13:21,256
You were my strength when I was weak

1142
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:24,981
You were my voice when I couldn't speak

1143
01:13:25,081 --> 01:13:28,690
You were my eyes when I couldn't see

1144
01:13:28,790 --> 01:13:32,415
You saw the best there was in me

1145
01:13:32,515 --> 01:13:36,425
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach

1146
01:13:36,525 --> 01:13:40,955
You gave me faith 'cause you believed

1147
01:13:41,055 --> 01:13:44,167
I'm everything I am

1148
01:13:47,244 --> 01:13:51,747
- Damn!
- Because you loved me

1149
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:01,641
Who are you?

1150
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:08,772
I'm just saying, who sings that well
and isn't a professional singer?

1151
01:14:08,872 --> 01:14:11,338
You're so good at singing
you actually suck!

1152
01:14:11,438 --> 01:14:14,371
- You guys want to come up for a nightcap?
- Yeah, well...

1153
01:14:14,471 --> 01:14:18,370
See if shit gets real?

1154
01:14:18,935 --> 01:14:24,366
Well, young Michael Buble and I
are gonna have a stogie by the pool, so...

1155
01:14:26,483 --> 01:14:28,984
- See you up there?
- Yeah.

1156
01:14:34,549 --> 01:14:38,781
I want you to know how much I appreciate
you doing this for me, Jason.

1157
01:14:39,115 --> 01:14:42,661
The greatest gift a grandson can give
his grandfather is a hot college girl

1158
01:14:42,761 --> 01:14:46,268
who wants to have unprotected sex
with him before he dies.

1159
01:14:46,478 --> 01:14:49,698
Yeah, well, most grandpas just want...

1160
01:14:49,798 --> 01:14:51,670
toffee.

1161
01:14:54,611 --> 01:14:56,778
What's the matter?

1162
01:14:57,743 --> 01:15:00,486
I think I'm gonna call off my wedding.

1163
01:15:02,509 --> 01:15:04,321
Well...

1164
01:15:04,841 --> 01:15:09,474
when you get married, it's for
a long fucking time. And it's hard.

1165
01:15:09,574 --> 01:15:13,873
So it damn well better be with a woman
who keeps things interesting.

1166
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:18,073
You know, your grandmother,
she tried to grow her own pot plant once?

1167
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:20,375
- Really?
- Yeah, she just...

1168
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,038
wanted to see if she could do it.

1169
01:15:24,205 --> 01:15:26,571
She was always surprising me like that.

1170
01:15:29,104 --> 01:15:32,384
We also tried anal once every five years.

1171
01:15:33,803 --> 01:15:35,323
Sweet.

1172
01:15:36,434 --> 01:15:39,598
I miss having someone
to share everything with.

1173
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:46,067
It's not fair to just keep Shadia
in the dark like this.

1174
01:15:46,167 --> 01:15:49,247
Since we started this,
it's just been one big lie.

1175
01:15:49,347 --> 01:15:51,880
She has no idea who I am.

1176
01:15:52,430 --> 01:15:54,765
I have to tell her the truth.

1177
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:58,763
Well, maybe telling her tonight
is a little abrupt.

1178
01:15:59,196 --> 01:16:01,762
The most important part
of a relationship is trust.

1179
01:16:01,862 --> 01:16:05,260
- That's right.
- And I'm going to start now.

1180
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:08,461
Or you can just wait till I have sex
with Lenore tonight,

1181
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:11,227
then you can tell Shadia everything.

1182
01:16:11,327 --> 01:16:15,492
- No. I'm just lying.
- Jason, I'm your grandfather!

1183
01:16:15,592 --> 01:16:18,240
- You wait till I fuck that college girl!
- I'm telling her now.

1184
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,475
Jason. Jason! Jason!

1185
01:16:21,575 --> 01:16:23,900
Jason! Jason!

1186
01:16:27,391 --> 01:16:29,457
'Sup, brah?

1187
01:16:30,956 --> 01:16:35,589
- Back off, D cups!
- Well, if it isn't the "Professor."

1188
01:16:35,889 --> 01:16:39,588
You know, it's amazing what you can find
with a name and Google these days.

1189
01:16:39,688 --> 01:16:41,621
You're not a real professor?

1190
01:16:41,721 --> 01:16:44,293
Oh, my God! You lied to us. How could you.

1191
01:16:44,393 --> 01:16:48,086
Wait, wait, wait, this is the best part.
This is the best part.

1192
01:16:48,551 --> 01:16:51,785
Richard "Dick" Kelly, Lieutenant Colonel

1193
01:16:51,885 --> 01:16:54,416
in the United States Army,

1194
01:16:54,516 --> 01:16:58,382
also known as the
American Gladiator "Nitro."

1195
01:16:58,482 --> 01:17:01,961
- What the fuck did you Google?
- Okay, well...

1196
01:17:02,061 --> 01:17:04,181
there's another best part then.

1197
01:17:04,281 --> 01:17:09,113
"Jason Patrick Kelly will wed
Meredith Miriam Goldstein

1198
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:12,759
"at Jericho Temple
on Saturday, March 27th."

1199
01:17:13,279 --> 01:17:17,278
Wait, that's... next Saturday.

1200
01:17:17,378 --> 01:17:21,011
Wait, you're grandfather and grandson?

1201
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:23,145
Oh, my God! That is so fucked up.

1202
01:17:23,245 --> 01:17:26,878
That is so hot.
I mean, that is so fucked up.

1203
01:17:29,309 --> 01:17:31,175
So...

1204
01:17:32,475 --> 01:17:35,041
Are you getting married next weekend?

1205
01:17:35,141 --> 01:17:38,074
I was. I was getting married...

1206
01:17:38,174 --> 01:17:42,274
- but then I met you, and now I don't...
- Oh, my God! No. Don't pull that shit.

1207
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:46,639
I feel fucking stupid enough as it is.

1208
01:17:49,937 --> 01:17:53,120
So you're not a professor?
Are you even a photographer?

1209
01:17:53,220 --> 01:17:55,029
I'm a lawyer.

1210
01:17:56,936 --> 01:17:59,669
I handle SEC compliance.

1211
01:18:00,802 --> 01:18:02,119
LLC agreements.

1212
01:18:02,219 --> 01:18:04,934
- I came up here to...
- Get the fuck out, Jason. Seriously.

1213
01:18:05,034 --> 01:18:07,084
- Can I have a second to explain?
- No!

1214
01:18:07,184 --> 01:18:10,902
Hold up, hold up.
Not so fast, "Professor."

1215
01:18:12,066 --> 01:18:15,398
For what's it worth,
I still really want to fuck you.

1216
01:18:15,498 --> 01:18:17,831
- And we're going to fuck.
- Yeah, we are.

1217
01:18:17,931 --> 01:18:21,163
- We're going to thunder fuck.
- You're gonna tsunami on my face!

1218
01:18:21,263 --> 01:18:23,097
You're gonna flood like the Nile.

1219
01:18:23,197 --> 01:18:25,329
Yeah. I guess the drought
in my pussy is finally over.

1220
01:18:25,429 --> 01:18:27,562
The villagers will finally eat.

1221
01:18:27,662 --> 01:18:30,929
You're gonna die while you're eating me out.
I want your last breath to be in my pussy.

1222
01:18:31,029 --> 01:18:33,696
- Lenore! You're such a slut.
- Police!

1223
01:18:33,796 --> 01:18:37,328
- That's right. Po-po in the ho-ho.
- Some kind of ganja party?

1224
01:18:37,428 --> 01:18:40,059
- Sorry to harsh your mellows.
- Where's my e-vite?

1225
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:42,139
- Is that the jacket?
- Check the right coat pocket.

1226
01:18:42,239 --> 01:18:44,459
- Turn around. Come on.
- That's my jacket. That's not his jacket.

1227
01:18:44,559 --> 01:18:47,958
Up against the palm. There you go.
Let's have a look. What've you got in here?

1228
01:18:48,058 --> 01:18:49,790
- Bingo-bango.
- OMG.

1229
01:18:49,890 --> 01:18:52,425
- What the fuck? That's not mine!
- "What the fuck?"

1230
01:18:52,525 --> 01:18:53,904
- That's not mine!
- The fuck?

1231
01:18:54,004 --> 01:18:57,490
Well, it looks like Spring Break
is finally drug free!

1232
01:18:57,590 --> 01:18:59,121
Come on, let's go. Let's go, pretty boy.

1233
01:18:59,221 --> 01:19:02,754
Shall we? No, it doesn't go down
that way. Let's go.

1234
01:19:02,854 --> 01:19:05,888
- I'll wait for you, Grandpa.
- Keep that shit tight for me!

1235
01:19:05,988 --> 01:19:08,619
He's my Henry Miller.

1236
01:19:08,719 --> 01:19:11,780
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Exactly!

1237
01:19:14,485 --> 01:19:16,961
Hey, there he is.

1238
01:19:17,418 --> 01:19:20,550
- You got blood on your pants, you know.
- Your license isn't even suspended, is it?

1239
01:19:20,650 --> 01:19:22,850
You made all this up just
so I'd come down here with you.

1240
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,165
I had to make sure you'd come.

1241
01:19:25,415 --> 01:19:29,849
- Fuck you!
- Just chill, Jason. Hakuna matata.

1242
01:19:31,182 --> 01:19:34,515
Who the fuck are you?
I should have known you were fucking crazy

1243
01:19:34,615 --> 01:19:38,247
the moment you started hitting on women
the day after Grandma's funeral!

1244
01:19:38,347 --> 01:19:41,946
Don't you fucking judge me. You have
no idea what I had with your grandmother.

1245
01:19:42,046 --> 01:19:45,278
And everything I've done these last
few days I've done for a reason.

1246
01:19:45,378 --> 01:19:48,512
You were about to fuck up royally
by getting married, and you fucking know it!

1247
01:19:48,612 --> 01:19:51,878
Yeah? What the fuck
am I supposed to do now?

1248
01:19:52,709 --> 01:19:56,274
Chase around some college girl that
doesn't even want to fucking talk to me?

1249
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:58,275
Not know what the fuck I'm doing
for the rest of my life?

1250
01:19:58,375 --> 01:20:00,475
Yeah, because at least you'd be thinking
for yourself for a change.

1251
01:20:00,575 --> 01:20:04,007
- What the fuck does that even mean?
- Your father has lorded over every decision

1252
01:20:04,107 --> 01:20:07,989
you've made in your adult life, and Meredith
is just the latest example of that!

1253
01:20:08,089 --> 01:20:09,805
She's not right for you, Jason.

1254
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,341
If you marry her, you're going to be
sleepwalking through the rest of your life

1255
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:14,239
and be completely unhappy,
just like your father!

1256
01:20:14,339 --> 01:20:16,404
I am already unhappy with my life,

1257
01:20:16,504 --> 01:20:19,971
because I've done nothing
but get fucked by you

1258
01:20:20,071 --> 01:20:22,670
and this insane fuck rampage
that you've been on.

1259
01:20:22,770 --> 01:20:26,168
It wasn't a "fuck rampage" for me.
It was a "fuck rampage" for you.

1260
01:20:26,268 --> 01:20:29,035
- How? How is this for me?
- I fucked up as a father.

1261
01:20:29,135 --> 01:20:32,401
I wasn't there to raise your dad
and he turned into a materialistic,

1262
01:20:32,501 --> 01:20:35,534
henpecked, poop-dick country clubber.

1263
01:20:35,634 --> 01:20:39,941
- I don't want that to happen to you.
- So that's what this was?

1264
01:20:41,799 --> 01:20:45,167
I was your last-ditch redemption project.

1265
01:20:50,163 --> 01:20:54,498
Congratulations, Grandpa.
You thought you were a shitty father?

1266
01:20:55,928 --> 01:20:58,236
Now you're a shitty grandfather.

1267
01:21:00,794 --> 01:21:03,294
I don't want to see you at my wedding.

1268
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,927
Stay the fuck away from me.

1269
01:21:48,150 --> 01:21:51,671
So, do you like this size, or this size?

1270
01:22:01,815 --> 01:22:06,213
Hey, hon, the people at the venue
said they don't have enough mint napkins,

1271
01:22:06,313 --> 01:22:09,880
so which one do you like better?

1272
01:22:09,980 --> 01:22:14,147
The seafoam or the pistachio?

1273
01:22:14,977 --> 01:22:16,679
I'll get it.

1274
01:22:31,673 --> 01:22:36,176
- What is it?
- It's... just another wedding present.

1275
01:22:36,506 --> 01:22:40,983
I hope it's that new big dipping spoon
from Williams-Sonoma.

1276
01:22:50,837 --> 01:22:55,769
...and as a tribute to Meredith and Jason

1277
01:22:55,869 --> 01:22:57,635
and the love that you guys share.

1278
01:22:57,735 --> 01:23:01,300
A love I will never know because my dog
died the first day I masturbated.

1279
01:23:01,400 --> 01:23:03,933
- So now I can't get hard unless...
- Okay.

1280
01:23:04,033 --> 01:23:08,499
Also, we've got to stop ISIS.
It's gotten... it's too much.

1281
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:12,064
Got it. Got it.

1282
01:23:12,164 --> 01:23:15,412
You know, today's celebration is...

1283
01:23:15,512 --> 01:23:19,230
much more than just about
the union of two people,

1284
01:23:19,330 --> 01:23:21,962
- it's also about the union of two families.
- Meredith...

1285
01:23:22,062 --> 01:23:24,963
The Kellys and the Goldsteins.

1286
01:23:25,661 --> 01:23:29,429
Let's have Jason and Meredith
tell their own story.

1287
01:23:33,461 --> 01:23:36,094
Nice job, Uncle Dave!

1288
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:22,556
Let's go in for the kill.

1289
01:24:32,546 --> 01:24:34,879
You've been hacked.

1290
01:25:04,407 --> 01:25:06,408
Because you loved me.

1291
01:25:20,869 --> 01:25:23,137
What the fuck?

1292
01:25:24,668 --> 01:25:27,401
That is not Martha's Vineyard.

1293
01:25:27,801 --> 01:25:29,468
Jason!

1294
01:25:31,118 --> 01:25:33,149
- Take it off!
- Trying, dear. Trying.

1295
01:25:33,249 --> 01:25:35,684
- Leave them on.
- Shut it down.

1296
01:25:35,784 --> 01:25:38,216
I have something to say.

1297
01:25:40,266 --> 01:25:43,930
I think I've been listening
to everybody else

1298
01:25:44,030 --> 01:25:46,463
about what I should be doing with my life.

1299
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:48,864
My grandpa said something
really interesting.

1300
01:25:48,964 --> 01:25:51,595
All right, cut the mics. I'm going up.

1301
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:55,862
...take that punch,
that point forward, things get easier.

1302
01:25:57,394 --> 01:25:59,461
- The mic's off.
- Jason, your mic cut out.

1303
01:25:59,561 --> 01:26:00,393
What?

1304
01:26:00,493 --> 01:26:03,727
Your mic cut out at the most
inopportune time, so we can't hear

1305
01:26:03,827 --> 01:26:06,625
why you want to leave those images up.

1306
01:26:06,725 --> 01:26:09,926
Hitting it won't work.
If they caught it from the PA... Band?

1307
01:26:10,026 --> 01:26:12,091
What the fuck?

1308
01:26:12,191 --> 01:26:14,624
Nick, can you tell her something for me?

1309
01:26:14,724 --> 01:26:17,223
Can you tell her that...

1310
01:26:18,457 --> 01:26:22,323
I'm really sorry, but I can't marry her.

1311
01:26:22,623 --> 01:26:26,438
You think that message
should come from me? Okay.

1312
01:26:27,854 --> 01:26:29,088
Uncle Ramon,

1313
01:26:29,188 --> 01:26:33,487
can you tell Meredith that Jason's sorry,
but... that they can't get married?

1314
01:26:37,086 --> 01:26:38,919
Fuck!

1315
01:26:39,650 --> 01:26:43,851
I forgot Uncle Ramon was deaf
and I talked to him like a normal.

1316
01:26:45,049 --> 01:26:49,082
Uncle Ruben, can you please tell
Meredith that Jason is really sorry,

1317
01:26:49,182 --> 01:26:51,715
but that he can't marry her?

1318
01:26:53,549 --> 01:26:58,681
He says he's very sorry,
but he can't marry you.

1319
01:26:58,781 --> 01:27:02,247
Uncle Ruben,
can you turn that thing up a little?

1320
01:27:02,347 --> 01:27:04,761
It doesn't get any louder.

1321
01:27:04,861 --> 01:27:07,596
Where'd you get that thing, SkyMall?

1322
01:27:08,113 --> 01:27:12,210
At this point, I'm kind of nervous that
anybody I pick will have a disability.

1323
01:27:12,410 --> 01:27:15,510
Okay. Waiter... hey, Pubes.

1324
01:27:17,009 --> 01:27:19,442
Can you please go tell Meredith

1325
01:27:19,542 --> 01:27:23,543
that my cousin Jason is very sorry,
but they cannot get married?

1326
01:27:23,973 --> 01:27:25,641
Come on, man. It's my first day...

1327
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:29,507
I know it's your first day,
but everybody needs you to be a man here.

1328
01:27:29,607 --> 01:27:30,974
Okay.

1329
01:27:33,706 --> 01:27:39,465
Just real quick... he sent me...
he wants me to tell you that...

1330
01:27:41,005 --> 01:27:43,539
He doesn't think that he can marry you.

1331
01:27:44,802 --> 01:27:47,371
But that he's sorry that he can't.

1332
01:27:52,034 --> 01:27:54,935
She's laughing, so I think
that you're in the clear, bro.

1333
01:27:55,035 --> 01:27:58,684
No, it's good. That was good.
You can just go back and tell him...

1334
01:27:59,734 --> 01:28:02,935
that I fucked his cousin Nick
while he was gone.

1335
01:28:03,899 --> 01:28:06,199
She's so super cool about it.

1336
01:28:06,299 --> 01:28:10,098
She's like, "Go! Do your thing. Do you."

1337
01:28:10,198 --> 01:28:13,263
She said that?
That's what she said, verbatim.

1338
01:28:13,363 --> 01:28:16,097
- Wait. Should I come down and say bye?
- No. God! Fuck no!

1339
01:28:16,197 --> 01:28:18,695
- No?
- Yeah. No need to even... let's not even...

1340
01:28:18,795 --> 01:28:22,297
You just... I've done it... we're great!

1341
01:28:22,429 --> 01:28:26,928
- Wait, where the fuck is he going?
- Jason! Jason!

1342
01:28:37,524 --> 01:28:40,792
It's actually the guy
on the moped with the iPad.

1343
01:28:41,224 --> 01:28:44,691
NSA stopped using utility vans years ago.

1344
01:28:45,123 --> 01:28:48,925
I figured once you sent the camera back,
it was time to take drastic measures.

1345
01:28:49,255 --> 01:28:53,488
- What'd he say? Are we doing this?
- Plan B, have Pam kidnap you.

1346
01:28:53,588 --> 01:28:55,354
I've got to get her back.

1347
01:28:55,454 --> 01:28:58,921
You want me to kidnap her?
I'll bring her back to you in a box, bro.

1348
01:28:59,021 --> 01:29:02,052
She's on a bus headed west
on I-85 across Florida.

1349
01:29:02,152 --> 01:29:04,120
Her boat leaves in four hours.

1350
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,918
It was easy to track her down because
of the whole Middle Eastern thing.

1351
01:29:07,018 --> 01:29:09,702
Bet you never thought you'd 69 a girl
because of the Patriot Act.

1352
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:11,983
You 69 her, man!

1353
01:29:12,083 --> 01:29:14,050
And then she's dead.

1354
01:29:14,150 --> 01:29:16,149
Are you kidding me, Pam?
This is what you drive?

1355
01:29:16,249 --> 01:29:20,064
Yeah, it is so easy selling kids drugs
from an ice cream truck. It's crazy!

1356
01:29:20,164 --> 01:29:22,782
- Jason! Jason!
- Go, go, go, go!

1357
01:29:22,882 --> 01:29:26,513
Jason, stop! Stop right now. Stop! Stop!

1358
01:29:26,613 --> 01:29:29,678
If you leave right now,
you can kiss your job at the firm goodbye!

1359
01:29:29,778 --> 01:29:33,029
David, will you get
the fuck out of the way!

1360
01:29:33,129 --> 01:29:35,978
Hey, hey! Come on! What the hell!

1361
01:29:36,078 --> 01:29:40,511
Hey, guy, unless you want a Chipwich or
some heroin, get off my ice cream truck!

1362
01:29:40,611 --> 01:29:44,428
- Who the fuck is this slob?
- Slob? I am a small business owner!

1363
01:29:44,528 --> 01:29:48,676
I am the backbone of this country!
I am holding a taser!

1364
01:29:48,776 --> 01:29:50,741
- Shit!
- Dude, should I stop?

1365
01:29:50,841 --> 01:29:51,642
What are you...

1366
01:29:51,742 --> 01:29:55,175
- I'm kind of in the middle of it right here.
- Shit!

1367
01:29:56,741 --> 01:29:59,350
Raise your hand if you've got a boner!

1368
01:30:00,805 --> 01:30:04,137
What were we supposed to do?
Just leave him on the side of road?

1369
01:30:04,437 --> 01:30:07,571
Hey, man, can you slow down?
You're making this very difficult.

1370
01:30:07,671 --> 01:30:10,704
What the fuck! That was you who drew
all those dicks on me last week?

1371
01:30:10,804 --> 01:30:14,169
- Yeah, I drew the dicks. Busted!
- Oh, my God! Shit!

1372
01:30:14,269 --> 01:30:18,136
Don't worry. Get up. We'll cut through
the back roads. You navigate. I'll drive.

1373
01:30:23,101 --> 01:30:25,535
Watch out! Watch out!

1374
01:30:35,131 --> 01:30:36,899
What the hell is going on?

1375
01:30:39,597 --> 01:30:41,957
- Got ourselves a bogey.
- All right, let's do this!

1376
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:51,762
Fuck! We gotta lose some of this weight.
Pam, throw some of this shit out of here!

1377
01:30:52,062 --> 01:30:55,861
Hey, look, it's Pam.
He's the good kind of Greek.

1378
01:30:57,227 --> 01:30:59,427
Hey, Gene. Hey, Gary.

1379
01:31:01,409 --> 01:31:03,866
How the hell do you know
how to drive like that, Dad?

1380
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:07,192
Damn it, Grandpa. Just tell him!

1381
01:31:07,790 --> 01:31:11,923
I was a Green Beret in Special Forces.
I taught insurgents behind enemy lines.

1382
01:31:12,023 --> 01:31:15,849
Mechanic was just my cover.
Good! We're all made up!

1383
01:31:16,521 --> 01:31:19,588
There they are!
That's them! Let's go, go, go!

1384
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:24,171
- Shadia!
- Jason?

1385
01:31:24,271 --> 01:31:26,786
Stop the bus! I need to talk to you!

1386
01:31:26,886 --> 01:31:29,498
- What are you doing here in an ice cream truck?
- Stop the bus!

1387
01:31:29,598 --> 01:31:31,169
- Okay!
- Pull over!

1388
01:31:31,269 --> 01:31:36,066
I'm not pulling over!
Thanks a lot, Pam! You narc!

1389
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:39,684
What! I'm not a narc, Barry! Fuck you!

1390
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:42,815
- Pam, you know him?
- Barry? Yeah, he's, like, my best friend.

1391
01:31:42,915 --> 01:31:45,748
I sold him, like, six tons of ecstasy...

1392
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:49,409
That's why they're not stopping the bus.
It's full of drugs.

1393
01:31:50,449 --> 01:31:51,614
Classic Pam.

1394
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:52,914
- I know them.
- Stop the bus!

1395
01:31:53,314 --> 01:31:55,481
Jason, where are you going?

1396
01:31:55,581 --> 01:31:57,647
What are you doing?

1397
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,913
What are they...

1398
01:32:11,143 --> 01:32:12,642
You'd better marry that girl.

1399
01:32:12,742 --> 01:32:16,010
Me? Nah, she's not really my type.
Too skinny.

1400
01:32:25,107 --> 01:32:27,506
What the fuck?

1401
01:32:27,606 --> 01:32:31,338
- Slow down! Oh, my God!
- What are you doing?

1402
01:32:33,538 --> 01:32:35,339
Slow down, dude!

1403
01:32:43,069 --> 01:32:45,672
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!
- Go get her, man!

1404
01:32:46,602 --> 01:32:48,500
- What is going on? What just happened?
- Hey.

1405
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:52,100
I don't even fucking know,
but I'm not getting married.

1406
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:56,499
Okay, so that makes it okay
that you were lying to me?

1407
01:32:56,599 --> 01:33:01,398
No. No, it doesn't. But you have to admit
that when we were together it felt great.

1408
01:33:01,498 --> 01:33:04,031
There was something real there.

1409
01:33:04,131 --> 01:33:05,998
Yeah.

1410
01:33:07,930 --> 01:33:10,597
What do you want from me, Jason?

1411
01:33:11,397 --> 01:33:13,565
I want you to stay.

1412
01:33:17,129 --> 01:33:20,061
I just can't stay.

1413
01:33:22,194 --> 01:33:24,459
- Okay.
- Okay.

1414
01:33:24,559 --> 01:33:26,959
No, I get it.

1415
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:29,358
Yeah.

1416
01:33:34,491 --> 01:33:36,925
What if I come with you?

1417
01:33:37,890 --> 01:33:39,757
Come...

1418
01:33:40,857 --> 01:33:43,358
- Really?
- I mean...

1419
01:33:43,789 --> 01:33:48,255
I just broke up
with my fiancee, lost my job.

1420
01:33:48,355 --> 01:33:51,488
And I think I'm wanted
by the police, so...

1421
01:33:51,588 --> 01:33:53,977
A year at sea...

1422
01:33:55,019 --> 01:33:57,187
might actually be the best place for me.

1423
01:33:59,752 --> 01:34:01,553
Okay.

1424
01:34:13,616 --> 01:34:16,280
- Break it up, lesbians! Let's go.
- Get down on the ground!

1425
01:34:16,380 --> 01:34:20,247
We're doing this because you're lesbians!
Get down on the ground!

1426
01:34:20,347 --> 01:34:23,779
According to Interstate Statute 17.37,

1427
01:34:23,879 --> 01:34:26,445
arrests made on the Interstate
Highway System

1428
01:34:26,545 --> 01:34:29,746
must be executed by state police,
not your local law enforcement

1429
01:34:29,846 --> 01:34:31,878
from your adjacent municipalities.

1430
01:34:31,978 --> 01:34:35,294
You seem, like, really familiar
with the penal code.

1431
01:34:35,394 --> 01:34:38,177
You seem real cocksure
about the juris-dick-tion you're in.

1432
01:34:38,277 --> 01:34:41,575
Real cocksure! Someone drew dicks
all over your face, you idiot!

1433
01:34:41,675 --> 01:34:43,875
Well, look at that!
You got dicks on your face.

1434
01:34:43,975 --> 01:34:46,307
That middle one's mine.
Look it, this one right here.

1435
01:34:46,407 --> 01:34:48,875
- I traced it.
- I thought I recognized that!

1436
01:34:48,975 --> 01:34:53,874
Enough catching up. Let my friends go.
They've literally done nothing wrong.

1437
01:34:53,974 --> 01:34:58,038
Pam, we've got obstruction of justice here.
We got reckless endangerment.

1438
01:34:58,138 --> 01:35:02,038
The bus is full of drugs, I get it. Speaking
of which, I've got to get out of here.

1439
01:35:02,138 --> 01:35:05,237
I got three keys of "Frisbees"
showing up at the store today, so...

1440
01:35:05,337 --> 01:35:09,336
- I should go, question mark?
- Why don't you take my squad car.

1441
01:35:09,436 --> 01:35:12,402
- That's a good idea. Give him your keys.
- You mean these keys?

1442
01:35:12,502 --> 01:35:14,519
There they are.

1443
01:35:15,434 --> 01:35:17,268
- Classic Pam.
- Classic Pam.

1444
01:35:17,368 --> 01:35:20,334
- What do you say we get some lunch?
- Love it.

1445
01:35:21,366 --> 01:35:23,467
See you fucks later.

1446
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:26,318
So...

1447
01:35:27,178 --> 01:35:29,603
I'm gonna go with her.

1448
01:35:30,664 --> 01:35:34,366
Yeah, you should. She seems real nice.

1449
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:39,529
You know, I think this
is our only way back now,

1450
01:35:39,629 --> 01:35:43,828
so I'm gonna try to get
these cocks off of my face

1451
01:35:43,928 --> 01:35:46,332
and get that truck started.

1452
01:35:48,161 --> 01:35:50,894
- Just give me one sec.
- Yeah.

1453
01:35:58,558 --> 01:36:01,491
Grandpa... Thank you for...

1454
01:36:01,791 --> 01:36:04,824
Don't give me any of that shit.
Just let me know when you get back.

1455
01:36:04,924 --> 01:36:08,722
And I actually want to see
your photos in Time magazine.

1456
01:36:08,822 --> 01:36:12,524
This camera set me back three months
of my army pension.

1457
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:27,600
Thanks, Grandpa.

1458
01:36:28,050 --> 01:36:30,460
And, Jason...

1459
01:36:31,510 --> 01:36:33,385
Yeah?

1460
01:36:34,050 --> 01:36:39,117
Back in the '80s, when Andre the Giant
used to go to the Playboy Mansion...

1461
01:36:39,716 --> 01:36:43,491
he'd stack five playmates on top of each
other on a bed and fingerfuck them all.

1462
01:36:43,591 --> 01:36:46,782
Five at a time.
Because his hands were so big.

1463
01:36:49,146 --> 01:36:50,980
So...

1464
01:36:51,913 --> 01:36:53,714
That's it.

1465
01:36:58,179 --> 01:37:00,378
Thanks, Grandpa.

1466
01:37:00,478 --> 01:37:02,977
"De Oppresso Liber."

1467
01:37:03,944 --> 01:37:06,411
Motto of the Green Berets.

1468
01:37:07,309 --> 01:37:09,910
It means "to liberate the oppressed."

1469
01:37:23,072 --> 01:37:25,973
- Hey. You ready?
- Yep.

1470
01:37:32,780 --> 01:37:36,101
I don't think he's gonna find
anybody as good as me.

1471
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:40,317
I'm sorry. But you know what they say...

1472
01:37:41,789 --> 01:37:46,457
"Tough times can sometimes
lead to tougher people."

1473
01:37:47,994 --> 01:37:50,025
That's Kurt Vonnegut.

1474
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:59,036
Yeah.

1475
01:38:08,248 --> 01:38:11,181
Holy fuckin' shit!

1476
01:38:12,720 --> 01:38:16,180
Has anyone ever told you that you have
the pussy of English Sheepdog?

1477
01:38:27,868 --> 01:38:29,767
Well, thanks for the ride.

1478
01:38:31,933 --> 01:38:34,401
You gonna be okay, Dad?

1479
01:38:35,667 --> 01:38:37,766
I miss her.

1480
01:38:39,349 --> 01:38:41,282
But I'll be okay.

1481
01:38:44,798 --> 01:38:47,432
I was a shitty father and I'm sorry.

1482
01:38:49,197 --> 01:38:51,489
Well, we'll work on it.

1483
01:39:07,393 --> 01:39:09,759
You're a hard man
to track down, Professor.

1484
01:39:13,423 --> 01:39:16,523
- Are those my pants?
- Yeah, these are your pants.

1485
01:39:16,623 --> 01:39:21,139
I found a Werther's Original in the pocket
and I've been sucking on it all morning.

1486
01:39:21,239 --> 01:39:23,721
You do know
that I'm not a professor, right?

1487
01:39:23,821 --> 01:39:27,454
Yeah, I know.
You're just a dirty, dirty grandpa,

1488
01:39:27,554 --> 01:39:32,567
and I'm just a girl from Long Island City
who likes to fuck old people.

1489
01:39:33,852 --> 01:39:36,187
I like your pull-out couch.

1490
01:39:36,287 --> 01:39:38,718
Yeah, well, I got news for you.

1491
01:39:38,818 --> 01:39:42,132
That's the only thing
that's gonna be pulling out tonight.

1492
01:39:42,232 --> 01:39:44,451
I'll be right back.

1493
01:40:00,680 --> 01:40:02,212
Hey.

1494
01:40:02,412 --> 01:40:05,013
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

1495
01:40:05,113 --> 01:40:09,238
I don't know if I can do this.
I haven't done it for a long time.

1496
01:40:28,008 --> 01:40:31,010
I guess they just slipped off.

1497
01:40:31,374 --> 01:40:35,573
I want you to tear open my bra
like it's a social security check.

1498
01:40:45,769 --> 01:40:47,803
Tell me you've fallen
and you can't get up.

1499
01:40:47,903 --> 01:40:50,434
"Help, I've fallen and I can't get up."

1500
01:40:50,534 --> 01:40:51,936
No!

1501
01:40:53,102 --> 01:40:55,967
Now fumble around and pretend
like you're trying to find your glasses.

1502
01:40:56,067 --> 01:40:59,569
"I'm trying to find my glasses.
I can't see.

1503
01:40:59,933 --> 01:41:04,365
"I found them! I can see! I can see!"

1504
01:41:04,465 --> 01:41:07,065
Tell me it's 4:00
and you want to eat dinner.

1505
01:41:07,165 --> 01:41:08,731
"It's 4:00 and I want to eat dinner."

1506
01:41:08,831 --> 01:41:12,614
Tell me the buttons on your remote control
are so small that you can't find Fox News.

1507
01:41:12,714 --> 01:41:16,530
"The buttons on my remote control
are so small I can't find Fox News!"

1508
01:41:16,630 --> 01:41:18,662
- Tell me how small they are!
- "They're real small!"

1509
01:41:18,762 --> 01:41:20,628
Tell me how this neighborhood
used to be safer!

1510
01:41:20,728 --> 01:41:22,212
"This neighborhood used to be safer!"

1511
01:41:22,312 --> 01:41:24,393
Tell me how things were better
under Eisenhower!

1512
01:41:24,493 --> 01:41:26,427
"Things were better under Eisenhower!"

1513
01:41:26,527 --> 01:41:29,393
- We like Ike!
- We like Ike!

1514
01:41:29,493 --> 01:41:31,993
- We like Ike!
- We like Ike!

1515
01:41:32,093 --> 01:41:35,392
We like Ike! We like Ike...

1516
01:41:38,658 --> 01:41:43,471
- Are you cumming or dying?
- I'm not sure! Maybe both!

1517
01:41:53,955 --> 01:41:57,793
"...for as by a man came death.

1518
01:41:59,886 --> 01:42:03,921
"By a man has come also life."

1519
01:42:04,802 --> 01:42:07,667
Richard Kelly II.

1520
01:42:07,817 --> 01:42:12,516
Congratulations on the baby's
new godparents, Jason and Shadia.

1521
01:42:12,616 --> 01:42:14,588
Congratulations!

1522
01:42:16,816 --> 01:42:19,681
Back to Mommy. All baptized.

1523
01:42:19,781 --> 01:42:22,648
You just keep surprising me, Grandpa.

1524
01:42:22,748 --> 01:42:24,780
New dad at 72.

1525
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,346
- Great fucking idea.
- Hey, watch your potty mouth!

1526
01:42:27,446 --> 01:42:29,447
- Jesus, sorry...
- Yeah, clean up your language.

1527
01:42:29,547 --> 01:42:32,230
And show some respect for your
new grandmother! I'm sorry, honey.

1528
01:42:32,330 --> 01:42:36,112
That's all right. And sweetie,
would it kill you to visit us sometimes?

1529
01:42:36,212 --> 01:42:39,311
- We never see you.
- Sorry, Nanna.

1530
01:42:39,586 --> 01:42:41,488
Did you get that card
I sent for your birthday?

1531
01:42:41,588 --> 01:42:44,658
Yeah. Yeah, with the $12 check.

1532
01:42:44,758 --> 01:42:47,461
- That was a very nice touch. Thank you.
- Thank you. That's right.

1533
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,230
Hey, what are you, gaining some weight?
You look a little heavy in the face.

1534
01:42:50,330 --> 01:42:51,999
- No, what are you...
- Where'd this come from?

1535
01:42:52,099 --> 01:42:54,401
- What?
- Where'd these guys come from?

1536
01:42:54,511 --> 01:42:55,945
- You wanna go get the car?
- Yeah.

1537
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:59,210
All right, I'll pull around the minivan.
Go to Daddy.

1538
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:02,610
- There we go, come to Daddy.
- All right.

1539
01:43:04,893 --> 01:43:07,259
It's a little bit weird.

1540
01:43:07,574 --> 01:43:09,909
She's my grandma.

1541
01:43:11,642 --> 01:43:13,573
And you're my uncle.

1542
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:17,455
- Look at that.
- Holy shit!

1543
01:43:18,005 --> 01:43:20,173
- It's a good dick.
- Oh, my God! Put that away.

1544
01:43:20,273 --> 01:43:21,838
- It's our dick.
- Yeah.

1545
01:43:21,938 --> 01:43:24,766
I'm just relieved it's not his dick.

1546
01:43:26,104 --> 01:43:29,509
- You want to get the bottle for me?
- Yeah.

1547
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:38,044
Hey, Jason. You should check your diaper,
bro. I think you just shit your pants.

1548
01:43:38,544 --> 01:43:41,211
And in church, too, in front of God.

1549
01:43:41,681 --> 01:43:43,983
I don't get why you're here.

1550
01:43:44,883 --> 01:43:48,655
Someone made a doodie in their yum-yum.

1551
01:43:48,955 --> 01:43:51,992
I'm just gonna put this out there once.
I know your baby just got baptized,

1552
01:43:52,092 --> 01:43:55,562
but I've got a guy in Tampa
who will pay upwards of 60 grand

1553
01:43:55,662 --> 01:44:00,167
for a healthy, white,
male baby that can fight.

1554
01:44:00,267 --> 01:44:01,768
This is a good deal. You should take it.

1555
01:44:01,868 --> 01:44:04,771
I don't know this guy that well,
but he seems extremely trustworthy.

1556
01:44:04,871 --> 01:44:07,167
Oh, yeah, yeah. You interested?

1557
01:44:07,267 --> 01:44:09,443
- Classic Pam.
- Classic Pam.

1558
01:44:09,943 --> 01:44:11,478
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

1559
01:44:11,578 --> 01:44:13,558
Classic Pam.

1560
01:44:15,816 --> 01:44:18,085
Guess it's never too late
to start over, huh?

1561
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:21,155
Yeah. Nice to have a second chance.

1562
01:44:21,255 --> 01:44:25,136
Maybe it won't take me so long to get
the father thing right this time.

1563
01:44:26,873 --> 01:44:28,395
Right?

1564
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:31,019
I'll go get his car seat.

1565
01:44:38,020 --> 01:44:39,939
Jamba!

1566
01:44:40,305 --> 01:45:40,577
