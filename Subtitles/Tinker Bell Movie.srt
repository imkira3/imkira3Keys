1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:54,525
<i>Have you ever wondered</i>
<i>how nature gets its glow?</i>

3
00:00:57,198 --> 00:01:01,567
<i>Who gives it light and color</i>
<i>as the seasons come and go?</i>

4
00:01:04,539 --> 00:01:07,975
<i>Who helps all creatures,</i>
<i>great and small,</i>

5
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,670
<i>to walk, to swim, to fly?</i>

6
00:01:13,214 --> 00:01:15,546
<i>Who crafts such tiny details?</i>

7
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,150
<i>You might see them if you try.</i>

8
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:28,459
<i>For it's all the work of fairies,</i>
<i>but they stay well out of sight.</i>

9
00:01:35,803 --> 00:01:40,638
<i>And the first time that a baby laughs,</i>
<i>a fairy's life takes flight.</i>

10
00:01:41,943 --> 00:01:43,433
<i>When the moon comes out</i>

11
00:01:43,544 --> 00:01:45,671
<i>To shine her face</i>

12
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,544
<i>The birds are fast asleep</i>

13
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:55,021
<i>And the lanterns hang from every post</i>
<i>The fairies leave their keep</i>

14
00:01:55,123 --> 00:01:58,820
<i>They join their hands</i>
<i>and sing their songs</i>

15
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,828
<i>That nary a soul can hear</i>

16
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,831
<i>In the springtime</i>
<i>when the earth is new</i>

17
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,595
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

18
00:02:09,704 --> 00:02:16,667
<i>To the fairies they draw near</i>

19
00:03:43,564 --> 00:03:45,122
Hello.
- Hello.

20
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,723
- Hello.
- Hi.

21
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,461
- Hello.
- Hello.

22
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,330
Hello?

23
00:03:51,506 --> 00:03:52,996
Queen Clarion.

24
00:04:04,318 --> 00:04:07,412
Born of laughter, clothed in cheer,

25
00:04:08,022 --> 00:04:10,320
happiness has brought you here.

26
00:04:10,858 --> 00:04:15,295
Welcome to Pixie Hollow.
I trust you found your way all right.

27
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:17,458
I think so.

28
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,732
Now, let's see about those wings.

29
00:05:05,379 --> 00:05:07,108
What are these things?

30
00:05:07,215 --> 00:05:09,979
They will help you
find your talent, little one.

31
00:05:10,084 --> 00:05:12,575
But how will I know which one is...

32
00:05:14,155 --> 00:05:15,554
You'll know.

33
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,767
Hmm.

34
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:54,210
Whoa!

35
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:58,520
Never seen one glow that much before,
even for Vidia.

36
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,420
You know,
I do believe you're right.

37
00:07:00,528 --> 00:07:04,362
Little daisy top
might be a very rare talent indeed.

38
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:15,307
Come forward, tinker fairies,

39
00:07:15,409 --> 00:07:20,403
and welcome the newest member
of your talent guild, Tinker Bell.

40
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,278
Glad we had a bath today, eh, Clank?

41
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:25,784
Excuse us!
- Coming through!

42
00:07:25,886 --> 00:07:28,354
Sorry! Make way for tinkers!

43
00:07:29,557 --> 00:07:33,323
Hady-hi, hady-ho, Miss Bell. I'm Clank.

44
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:36,725
Splinters, Clank. Say it, don't spray it.

45
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:40,323
Phineas T. Kettletree, Esquire,
at your service.

46
00:07:40,434 --> 00:07:41,594
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

47
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,865
Oh, foo! He's Bobble, I'm Clank.

48
00:07:46,073 --> 00:07:47,540
Clank, Bobble.

49
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:51,906
We're pleased as a pile of
perfectly polished pots you're here.

50
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:53,071
Uh...

51
00:07:53,314 --> 00:07:54,281
Me, too.

52
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,543
Come on, Miss Bell.
There's so much to show you.

53
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:05,822
You've arrived
at a most wondrous and glorious time.

54
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:07,188
Really? Why?

55
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,594
Why, it's almost time
for the changing of the seasons.

56
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:14,998
You see, here in Pixie Hollow, there are
different realms for every time of year.

57
00:08:15,102 --> 00:08:16,160
Well, there's one up ahead.

58
00:08:21,242 --> 00:08:24,473
Winter Woods. It's always cold here.

59
00:08:24,578 --> 00:08:28,173
Look there! Snowflake and frost fairies
returning home for...

60
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:30,944
For some well-deserved rest.

61
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:34,579
Aye. They've just finished
bringing winter to the world.

62
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:38,652
It's the off-season
for the autumn fairies, too.

63
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,058
Always practicing
that perfect shade of amber, eh?

64
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:43,960
And the fairies of Summer Glade

65
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,056
still have plenty of time to get ready.

66
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:48,362
But not as much
as the autumn fairies,

67
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:49,902
of course, because, well...

68
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:53,496
Yes, Clanky. Because
right now, fairies of every talent

69
00:08:53,607 --> 00:08:56,906
are preparing for my favorite season,
springtime!

70
00:08:58,446 --> 00:08:59,435
Oh!

71
00:09:02,016 --> 00:09:05,508
Get along.
Get along, little sproutlings, and dig.

72
00:09:10,524 --> 00:09:11,923
Hello, there!

73
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:16,626
Come on, Miss Bell.
You've got to see where we live.

74
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:25,164
Welcome to Tinker's Nook.

75
00:09:25,272 --> 00:09:27,399
Oh, wow!

76
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,918
Oh.

77
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:42,115
Come on.
There's so much to show you.

78
00:10:05,212 --> 00:10:06,338
Cute.

79
00:10:08,315 --> 00:10:09,680
Just taking some supplies down...

80
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:12,514
They're taking supplies
down to the workshop.

81
00:10:15,322 --> 00:10:16,687
Let her go.

82
00:10:17,324 --> 00:10:18,313
Watch out for falling...

83
00:10:18,426 --> 00:10:20,860
Watch out for falling maple seeds!

84
00:10:24,331 --> 00:10:25,389
Wow!

85
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:39,271
And over here is where most of us live.
There's your house...

86
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,678
There's your house, Tinker Bell.

87
00:10:47,087 --> 00:10:48,850
- It's mine?
- Sure is.

88
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:51,684
We were hoping the new arrival
would be one of us,

89
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,192
so we got the place all ready.

90
00:10:54,295 --> 00:10:55,694
We rounded up some work clothes...

91
00:10:55,796 --> 00:10:58,196
- We didn't know your size.
- Yes, our apologies, but...

92
00:10:58,299 --> 00:11:00,927
- But they might be too big.
- Yeah, well, that's only...

93
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,196
'Cause you're so tiny.

94
00:11:03,304 --> 00:11:04,771
That'll do, Clank.

95
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,238
Please come on down to the workshop
when you're ready.

96
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,104
Fairy Mary will want to meet you.

97
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:10,438
Goodbye.

98
00:11:18,452 --> 00:11:19,419
Oh.

99
00:12:04,498 --> 00:12:06,159
Stop! What?

100
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:10,635
A five-gauge twig for an axle?
Clank, I told you it took a seven.

101
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:11,932
Oh, you said five.

102
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:16,169
I said seven! Oh, Clank, I tell you,
sometimes you can be pretty,

103
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,539
pretty...

104
00:12:20,648 --> 00:12:22,843
So pretty.

105
00:12:24,718 --> 00:12:28,119
- Who's that, then?
- It's Tinker Bell, you snail brain.

106
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:33,622
Wow, everyone seems so busy.

107
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:36,218
Well, spring won't spring itself.

108
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:40,767
Indeed, my bellowing buddy.
And we tinkers are a big part of it.

109
00:12:40,868 --> 00:12:43,268
Allow us to elucidate, Miss Bell.

110
00:12:44,104 --> 00:12:47,073
- We fiddle and fix.
- We craft and create.

111
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:50,143
- We carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

112
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:53,042
- Weave saddles and satchels.
- For birdies, you see.

113
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:56,139
- Make baskets and bushels.
- To carry the seeds!

114
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,946
- When preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more!

115
00:12:59,053 --> 00:13:03,217
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

116
00:13:04,758 --> 00:13:05,884
That was great.

117
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:10,794
So you see, Miss Bell, we help fairies
of every talent with our creations.

118
00:13:10,898 --> 00:13:14,629
Unfortunately, all those fairies
are out of luck this year.

119
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:17,363
Unless we can actually
deliver these things to them.

120
00:13:17,471 --> 00:13:19,905
The wagon repairs are finished, I trust?

121
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,137
Yes, Fairy Mary.

122
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:28,381
- Tip-top shape.
- No wheels missing whatsoever!

123
00:13:29,817 --> 00:13:31,284
Then let's see it.

124
00:13:31,385 --> 00:13:33,819
- Ah, you see... Well...
- See,

125
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:37,152
- with your eyes?
- Define "see," actually...

126
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,122
- You have to meet Tinker Bell!
- What? Who?

127
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:43,125
- She's new, Fairy Mary.
- Nice to meet you.

128
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:46,097
Rapture! A new charge on whom
we can lavish

129
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,930
all our tinkering wisdom and expertise!

130
00:13:51,071 --> 00:13:52,971
Let me see those hands.

131
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:56,776
Teetering teapots, so dainty.

132
00:13:57,111 --> 00:14:01,172
Don't worry, dear. We'll build up those
tinker muscles in no time.

133
00:14:01,348 --> 00:14:02,406
Okay.

134
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:06,144
- Now, boys, the deliveries?
- Aye, we're on it.

135
00:14:06,253 --> 00:14:09,120
As a matter of fact,
we're heading out right this second.

136
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:13,091
- But we've only got one wheel.
- What was that?

137
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,561
Nothing really,
Clank was just asking...

138
00:14:17,665 --> 00:14:20,031
If I can go as well!

139
00:14:20,501 --> 00:14:23,129
- Yeah! Good one. Very nice.
- Yes! I wondered that,

140
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:27,697
- if you could go with us. Yes.
- That's exactly what he was saying.

141
00:14:28,275 --> 00:14:30,072
Very well. Get on with it, then.

142
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,909
Slow down, Cheese, I can't keep up!

143
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:38,107
The mouse's name is Cheese?

144
00:14:38,218 --> 00:14:41,051
Must be.
He always comes when we yell it.

145
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:12,375
Sprinting thistles!
Bobble! Bobble!

146
00:15:48,422 --> 00:15:53,621
Easy. Easy, boy. It's all right.
Fawn's got you.

147
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:59,331
Easy. Easy, girl. It's all right.
Silvermist's got you.

148
00:16:00,534 --> 00:16:01,967
Oh, you all right, sugar cane?

149
00:16:02,069 --> 00:16:03,362
Be careful, Rosetta, she may faint!

150
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:07,369
Elevate her legs. No, wait.
I mean her head.

151
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:09,305
Wait, wait, wait. Okay.
If she's red, raise the head.

152
00:16:09,409 --> 00:16:11,570
If she's pale, raise the tail.

153
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,745
Does she look pale or red?

154
00:16:13,881 --> 00:16:15,644
She looks squished.

155
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,543
Sorry.

156
00:16:17,785 --> 00:16:20,913
Here, let me, raindrop.
So, what happened to you, anyway?

157
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,353
- Well, I...
- It was sprinting thistles!

158
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:26,719
Those weeds are an absolute menace.

159
00:16:26,827 --> 00:16:30,263
Always trampling things,
poking people in the petunia.

160
00:16:31,732 --> 00:16:33,256
Gather round, ladies.

161
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,766
We've brought some selections

162
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:38,031
from the new spring line
of tinker specialties!

163
00:16:38,138 --> 00:16:39,730
- All right!
- Show us, show us!

164
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:42,866
- What'd you bring?
- Your rainbow tubes, Iridessa.

165
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:45,638
Finally! Silvermist,
could you help me?

166
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,247
Oh.

167
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,925
What're you gonna do with that?

168
00:17:08,035 --> 00:17:09,969
I'm gonna take it to the mainland.

169
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,264
What's the mainland?

170
00:17:11,371 --> 00:17:13,396
It's where we're gonna go
change winter to spring.

171
00:17:13,507 --> 00:17:16,135
The seasons change all the time there.

172
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,835
I'll get to apply my artistic sensibilities.

173
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:22,006
Yeah. And I'll have breakfast ready
for all the wittle fuzzies

174
00:17:22,115 --> 00:17:24,106
coming out of hibernation.

175
00:17:26,153 --> 00:17:28,018
We just follow the second star...

176
00:17:28,121 --> 00:17:30,681
Ride the breeze, follow the waves...

177
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:32,759
All the way across the sea...

178
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,725
And then, there it is.

179
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:39,593
Wow! The mainland sounds flitterific!

180
00:17:42,803 --> 00:17:46,603
Yes. The glamorous lives
of the nature-talent fairies, eh?

181
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,174
We'd love to stay and chat, but...

182
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:51,938
But we tinkers
have real work to do. Right?

183
00:17:52,045 --> 00:17:55,276
Don't get your wings in a bunch.
- Don't be like that.

184
00:17:55,382 --> 00:17:56,815
Nice to meet you all!

185
00:17:56,917 --> 00:18:00,148
You, too! Fly with you later!
- Fly with you later!

186
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,855
Right! Here we are.

187
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,118
A pretty large order of pollen pots
for the...

188
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,968
Last thing is berry bushels
to deliver to the glen...

189
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,306
Is it okay
if I just catch up with you later?

190
00:18:25,412 --> 00:18:26,902
Oh, I suppose.

191
00:18:27,681 --> 00:18:29,740
Can you find your way back?

192
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,984
- Yeah, yeah. Sure I can.
- Well, I...

193
00:18:33,186 --> 00:18:35,746
- All right, then.
- Just be careful!

194
00:18:39,226 --> 00:18:40,215
Hi, there!

195
00:18:43,063 --> 00:18:44,257
Sorry.

196
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:46,132
Vidia, right?

197
00:18:53,073 --> 00:18:55,906
We didn't officially meet.
I'm Tinker Bell.

198
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,972
Oh, yes.

199
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,540
The new girl.

200
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:04,276
That's right! So, what's your talent?

201
00:19:06,219 --> 00:19:08,153
What do you think it is?

202
00:19:08,755 --> 00:19:14,250
You're a pollen-izer? Pollen-ator?
Pollen-picker? Pollen-plucker?

203
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:17,990
I am a fast-flying fairy,
a true rare talent.

204
00:19:18,465 --> 00:19:20,933
And this is but a small part of what I do.

205
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,697
I make breezes in the summer,
blow down leaves in the fall.

206
00:19:24,805 --> 00:19:27,603
My winds even brought you here, dear.

207
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,575
Fairies of every talent depend on me.

208
00:19:31,511 --> 00:19:33,877
Hey, that's just like what I do.

209
00:19:35,282 --> 00:19:36,271
Excuse me?

210
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,714
I mean, tinkers help fairies
of every talent, too.

211
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,344
So we're kind of the same, you know?

212
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,353
Sweetie, I make forces of nature.

213
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:49,556
You make pots and kettles.

214
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:53,929
I work up in the sky,
and you work down in a ditch.

215
00:19:54,601 --> 00:19:55,659
Hey!

216
00:19:55,769 --> 00:19:58,897
Don't get me wrong, sunshine.
Being a tinker is really swell and all,

217
00:19:59,006 --> 00:20:02,169
but I wouldn't go around
bragging about your talent.

218
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:04,573
It's not like spring depends on you.

219
00:20:04,678 --> 00:20:06,202
Of course it does!

220
00:20:06,313 --> 00:20:09,908
And when I go to the mainland,
I'll prove just how important we are.

221
00:20:10,017 --> 00:20:11,985
When who goes to the mainland?

222
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,918
Me, of course! For spring!

223
00:20:17,324 --> 00:20:19,986
Oh, of course. You'll prove it, huh?

224
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,351
Yes, I will.

225
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:26,160
Well, I, for one,
am looking forward to that. Excuse me.

226
00:20:27,701 --> 00:20:29,464
No. Excuse me.

227
00:20:35,042 --> 00:20:37,033
"Mine is a rare talent."

228
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:38,301
Ugh.

229
00:20:40,047 --> 00:20:42,345
Try and tell me tinkers don't matter.

230
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,940
I'll show her what a rare talent really is,
when I...

231
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,880
Oh.

232
00:22:19,412 --> 00:22:21,937
- Hey, Tink, what you got there?
- Oh, hi.

233
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,013
I don't know. I just found them.

234
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:27,886
Lost things.

235
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,550
- Lost things.
- Aye.

236
00:22:30,657 --> 00:22:34,616
Stuff gets lost and washes up
on Neverland from time to time.

237
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,457
You know, from the mainland.

238
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,690
These come from the mainland?

239
00:22:38,798 --> 00:22:41,460
That place sounds
more fascinating all the time.

240
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:46,096
Berry bushels, check.
Pollen pots, check. Lost things, check.

241
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:47,807
Huh?

242
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:51,773
Lost things?
Why are you fiddling with that junk?

243
00:22:51,878 --> 00:22:53,209
Oh, um...

244
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:56,241
Well, they were just so unusual.

245
00:22:56,349 --> 00:22:58,817
You mustn't be wasting your time
with that rubbish.

246
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,479
And I won't have it
cluttering up my workshop.

247
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,419
And as for you two,

248
00:23:04,224 --> 00:23:06,590
no more dilly-dallying around.

249
00:23:06,693 --> 00:23:09,093
And don't forget about
the Queen's review tonight.

250
00:23:09,196 --> 00:23:12,063
Goodness, there's still
so much to be done!

251
00:23:15,735 --> 00:23:17,134
Thank you.

252
00:23:17,804 --> 00:23:19,897
Sorry about your trinkets, Miss Bell.

253
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,998
Well, we'd best be getting ready
for the review, anyway.

254
00:23:23,109 --> 00:23:25,270
What is the Queen's review?

255
00:23:25,378 --> 00:23:29,314
You see, the Queen is going to
review all the preparations for spring!

256
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:33,409
Yeah, it's a good time for us tinkers
to show what we can do, eh?

257
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,283
- Oh, indeed.
- Really?

258
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:37,913
Like me. I can be a wheel.

259
00:23:38,658 --> 00:23:39,716
Hmm.

260
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,524
Perfect. That's my chance.

261
00:24:40,654 --> 00:24:45,148
Okay, everybody, turn!
Ready for the base coat over here!

262
00:24:55,802 --> 00:25:00,705
Splendid, splendid. Stack those neatly,
plenty of time before the Queen arrives.

263
00:25:00,807 --> 00:25:02,001
It's the Queen!

264
00:25:02,108 --> 00:25:05,202
What? She's here? Now?
Play, music fairies.

265
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,576
Yes, play!

266
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,826
Queen Clarion, Your Illustriousness!

267
00:25:24,931 --> 00:25:29,163
As Minister of Spring,
I welcome you to Springtime Square.

268
00:25:29,369 --> 00:25:31,769
What? No fireworks, Minister?

269
00:25:31,871 --> 00:25:34,897
Oh, well, yeah, that could be arranged.
Light fairies! Light fairies!

270
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:38,205
I'm teasing.
You always make such a fuss,

271
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:41,178
and everything always
turns out wonderfully.

272
00:25:44,184 --> 00:25:46,880
Well, I think you'll find
that we have things well in hand.

273
00:25:46,986 --> 00:25:48,544
When the Everblossom blooms,

274
00:25:48,655 --> 00:25:51,180
we'll be ready to bring
spring to the mainland!

275
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:53,521
Music to my ears.

276
00:25:53,626 --> 00:25:56,857
I know you've all put in months
of practice and preparation,

277
00:25:57,397 --> 00:26:00,161
but keep up the good work
these last few days,

278
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:02,291
- because just as fairies...
- Queen Clarion!

279
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,137
Huh?

280
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:07,005
Queen Clarion!

281
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:10,739
- Did I miss anything?
- No, no, no.

282
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,400
Phew! Good.

283
00:26:12,979 --> 00:26:13,968
It's all right.

284
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,877
I came up with some fantastic things

285
00:26:15,982 --> 00:26:18,542
for tinkers to use
when we go to the mainland.

286
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,287
What's she talking about?

287
00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:23,981
Let me show you!

288
00:26:25,692 --> 00:26:28,923
First, baby chipmunks
can't eat the whole nut, right?

289
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:31,360
Their little teeth can't chew big bites.

290
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:34,922
So you just crank back this lever,
and it's...

291
00:26:44,511 --> 00:26:45,671
Whoops.

292
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:49,710
- It's kind of a work in progress.
- Yes, yes, yes. Very clever.

293
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:52,974
Oh!

294
00:26:53,086 --> 00:26:55,680
And I made this, too.
It's a flower-sprayer.

295
00:26:55,789 --> 00:26:58,986
- Tinker Bell, I...
- Here, allow me to demonstrate.

296
00:27:08,802 --> 00:27:09,962
Sorry.

297
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:14,338
- But wait till you see this last one.
- Tinker Bell, sweetheart,

298
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,604
has no one explained?

299
00:27:18,344 --> 00:27:19,868
Explained what?

300
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:23,180
Tinker fairies
don't go to the mainland, dear.

301
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,417
What?

302
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:28,112
All of those things
are done by the nature-talent fairies.

303
00:27:28,221 --> 00:27:30,815
Your work is here in Pixie Hollow.

304
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:34,554
- But I thought that...
- I'm sorry, Tinker Bell.

305
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:40,763
Oh, okay. No. No, that's good.

306
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,563
I mean,
I really couldn't make it anyway.

307
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:48,539
So, good. Yeah.
This actually works out good.

308
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:53,775
I mean, well...
So, I'm just gonna... Yeah.

309
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,664
Back so soon?

310
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:14,560
You didn't go?

311
00:28:14,667 --> 00:28:18,262
Goodness, no.
Far too much work to do down here.

312
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:31,479
Vidia was right. Being a tinker stinks.

313
00:28:32,352 --> 00:28:34,149
Excuse me?

314
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,118
It's just, why don't we get to go
to the mainland?

315
00:28:39,225 --> 00:28:43,559
The mainland? Who gives
a pile of pebbles about the mainland?

316
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,789
But, Fairy Mary,
the other fairies get to go.

317
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:50,097
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you a garden fairy?

318
00:28:51,004 --> 00:28:52,198
Well, no.

319
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:54,739
- Are you a light fairy?
- No.

320
00:28:54,841 --> 00:28:57,605
Animal fairy? Water fairy, perhaps?

321
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:59,177
No and no.

322
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,477
No. You're not. You are a tinker.
It's who you are.

323
00:29:03,917 --> 00:29:05,407
Be proud of it.

324
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,755
The day you can
magically make the flowers grow,

325
00:29:09,856 --> 00:29:13,656
or capture the rays of the sun
and whatnot, then you can go.

326
00:29:14,027 --> 00:29:16,257
Until then, your work is here.

327
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,315
Good idea, Fairy Mary.

328
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:55,601
Get your pixie dust yet?

329
00:29:55,702 --> 00:29:56,669
Just did.

330
00:29:56,769 --> 00:29:58,634
- Nice day for flying.
- Sure is.

331
00:29:58,738 --> 00:29:59,727
Here you go, Silvermist.

332
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,568
Thank you, Terence.

333
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:05,176
I hope Tinker Bell is okay.

334
00:30:05,278 --> 00:30:07,644
I know. That poor little sapling.

335
00:30:08,481 --> 00:30:10,540
She looked pretty wilted yesterday.

336
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,016
Well, I wouldn't blame her
if she stayed in bed all day.

337
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,643
Morning, girls!

338
00:30:14,754 --> 00:30:15,721
Tinker Bell?
- Tinker Bell?

339
00:30:15,822 --> 00:30:19,724
Guess what? I've decided I'm not
gonna be a tinker fairy anymore.

340
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:20,815
- What?
- What?

341
00:30:20,927 --> 00:30:24,090
Well, I was thinking.
Why do I have to be a tinker?

342
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,757
Just 'cause
some silly hammer glowed?

343
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,528
I mean, who's to say
it wasn't some big mistake?

344
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:31,934
Maybe I can just switch my talent.

345
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:35,439
Switch your talent?
I don't know, Tinker Bell...

346
00:30:35,541 --> 00:30:38,203
If you could teach me your talents,
any of them,

347
00:30:38,311 --> 00:30:41,178
maybe I could show the Queen
I can work with nature, too.

348
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:45,183
And then she'd let me go
to the mainland for spring.

349
00:30:45,284 --> 00:30:48,481
Oh, Tinker Bell.
That's just not how it works.

350
00:30:48,588 --> 00:30:51,386
- Well, maybe she could.
- She's right. She could.

351
00:30:51,491 --> 00:30:54,221
Well, I've never heard of someone
switching talents before.

352
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,261
She's right. Me, neither.

353
00:30:56,429 --> 00:31:02,925
Look. You all do things that are
beautiful and magical and important.

354
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,672
But me, well,

355
00:31:06,773 --> 00:31:10,504
there's gotta be more to my life
than just pots and kettles.

356
00:31:11,377 --> 00:31:14,244
All I'm asking
is that you give me a chance.

357
00:31:16,049 --> 00:31:17,482
I'll help you, Tinker Bell.

358
00:31:17,583 --> 00:31:19,244
Thank you, Sil.

359
00:31:19,352 --> 00:31:21,217
Me, too. Could be fun.

360
00:31:21,454 --> 00:31:25,390
Well, first time for everything, I guess.
What harm can come from trying?

361
00:31:25,491 --> 00:31:28,153
Well, I still think this is a bad idea.

362
00:31:30,797 --> 00:31:33,357
So, for your first day
of water fairy training,

363
00:31:33,466 --> 00:31:35,661
I could show you
how to make ripples in the pond.

364
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,826
Okay!

365
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,734
Or teach you how to talk
to the babbling brook.

366
00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,568
Oh, that sounds fun, too.

367
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:44,905
Or wait, wait, wait.
I got it, I got it, I got it!

368
00:31:45,511 --> 00:31:48,207
Dewdrops on spider webs!

369
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:51,045
Come on. I'll show you how to do it.

370
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:53,516
- Good luck, Tink!
- You can do it!

371
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,179
Oh, um...

372
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:57,779
Go get 'em.

373
00:32:00,259 --> 00:32:06,129
Just cup your hands like this,
reach into the water, and...

374
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,028
Okay, you've heard of a dewdrop?

375
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:13,071
This is a don't drop.
That's water fairy humor.

376
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,505
It's good.

377
00:32:16,109 --> 00:32:17,076
Come on.

378
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:20,009
Okay, Tink, now,
this next part can be a little tricky.

379
00:32:20,113 --> 00:32:22,877
It takes a very steady,
delicate hand to...

380
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:27,616
Where's your dewdrop?

381
00:32:27,887 --> 00:32:28,854
Oh.

382
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:32,085
Forgot my dewdrop.

383
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:37,325
Hey! I did

384
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:39,253
it.

385
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:42,766
Shake that one off. Shake it off.
You can do this!

386
00:32:45,972 --> 00:32:49,305
That's it. That's it, Tink.
You're doing it! You're...

387
00:32:50,943 --> 00:32:52,706
Now, Tink, try to...

388
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,243
No, no, sweetie, you need to...
Well, maybe if you...

389
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,180
Well, you have to admire
her persistence.

390
00:33:00,453 --> 00:33:01,477
Tinker Bell!

391
00:33:01,587 --> 00:33:03,885
Although, sometimes hammers glow

392
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:05,990
for a reason.

393
00:33:11,798 --> 00:33:12,890
Whoa.

394
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:29,915
You know, you always struck me
as a light fairy kind of gal.

395
00:33:41,894 --> 00:33:44,488
<i>Here we go in the treasure...</i>

396
00:33:48,467 --> 00:33:49,468
- Have you seen Tink?
- No, thank you. Not thirsty!

397
00:33:52,738 --> 00:33:54,706
No, no. Not "drink," Tink!

398
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:57,703
Pink? I like purple meself!

399
00:33:57,810 --> 00:34:00,540
Tink! Have you seen Tink?

400
00:34:00,646 --> 00:34:01,772
What?

401
00:34:02,348 --> 00:34:05,408
I do not stink! Maybe it's you, eh?

402
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,488
Hey, have you seen Tink?

403
00:34:11,824 --> 00:34:15,316
- Fairy Mary's gonna be cross.
- Aye, Clank.

404
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,658
We'd better take some of this
off Miss Bell's plate, so...

405
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:20,222
- All right, then.
- No, no, no! Wait, wait, Clank!

406
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:28,998
What are...
Will you two stop mucking about?

407
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:32,373
- What Clank did was, he took it off...
- Bobble told me that I should...

408
00:34:32,478 --> 00:34:36,437
I see Tinker Bell has
got her work done, mysteriously.

409
00:34:37,049 --> 00:34:38,448
Where is she, anyway?

410
00:34:39,652 --> 00:34:42,212
Well, you see, she's...

411
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,613
She went with Cheese to...

412
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,117
No, no. Clank means
she went to get cheese, you see,

413
00:34:49,228 --> 00:34:52,220
- the food, for Cheese the mouse...
- Yes, the food, for Cheese the mouse.

414
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:54,959
...because he was whining.

415
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:56,056
Yeah. Like a baby.

416
00:34:56,168 --> 00:34:58,864
Like a wittle, wee baby, there.

417
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:15,819
Okay, what can I teach you that's
gonna do the least amount of damage?

418
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:20,882
Oh, I know. Follow me, Tinker Bell.

419
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:30,563
The last light of day,
it's the richest kind of all!

420
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,538
Wait for it. Wait for it.

421
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,505
Okay, and now!

422
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:38,474
Oh, wow.

423
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:41,938
Huh?

424
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:45,314
It's incredible.

425
00:35:45,418 --> 00:35:47,249
Now for the fun part.

426
00:35:48,154 --> 00:35:51,920
- Do you think it's heavy?
- No. It's light.

427
00:36:03,636 --> 00:36:05,001
Okay, okay.

428
00:36:37,336 --> 00:36:38,394
Stay.

429
00:36:38,504 --> 00:36:41,530
- Here, Tink. Let me...
- No! I almost got it.

430
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,335
If I just get you started...

431
00:36:43,442 --> 00:36:45,376
This is impossible!

432
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:50,043
Look out!

433
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,517
Oh, no.

434
00:36:58,224 --> 00:36:59,953
Whoa!

435
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:05,197
I wonder how it's going.

436
00:37:06,065 --> 00:37:07,930
Fly, Tink, fly!

437
00:37:08,601 --> 00:37:09,761
Uh-oh.

438
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:12,261
We'll save you, Tink!

439
00:37:12,371 --> 00:37:14,339
Bob and weave!
Bob and weave!

440
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,670
Cover your tushy!

441
00:37:29,655 --> 00:37:31,987
- We fiddle and fix.
- Craft and create.

442
00:37:32,091 --> 00:37:34,218
- Carve acorn buckets.
- To hold flower paint.

443
00:37:34,326 --> 00:37:36,886
- Preparing for spring.
- We do all this and more.

444
00:37:36,996 --> 00:37:40,762
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!
- Yes, being a tinker is never a bore!

445
00:37:43,202 --> 00:37:45,432
Tinker Bell,
I'd like a word with you.

446
00:37:45,538 --> 00:37:46,903
Fairy Mary!

447
00:37:47,573 --> 00:37:52,272
See, I was on my deliveries,
and it's actually kind of...

448
00:37:52,378 --> 00:37:55,643
Save it.
I know what you've been up to, missy.

449
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:00,351
And I had such high hopes for you.

450
00:38:11,697 --> 00:38:13,688
- You'd do well to listen to her...
- Why?

451
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,733
So I can do this my whole life?

452
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,861
I don't wanna be just a stupid tinker!

453
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:24,208
No, no, not that you guys are...

454
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:29,375
I didn't mean that... Guys, I wasn't...

455
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:33,117
I have to go.

456
00:38:47,566 --> 00:38:52,435
Now, flap them. Flap them.
That's it! Have fun!

457
00:38:57,343 --> 00:38:59,174
Hey, Tink! You ready?

458
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:01,273
A little nervous, actually.

459
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,042
Oh, don't be silly.
Come on, you'll be fine.

460
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,880
We're teaching baby birds
how to fly.

461
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:10,248
First, you have to get their attention.

462
00:39:10,356 --> 00:39:13,223
Smile and establish trust.

463
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:19,662
See? Okay, open your wings, honey,
and flap them up and down.

464
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:24,026
Up and down. That's the way.
Faster, faster.

465
00:39:24,136 --> 00:39:28,038
That's right. Yes! You're doing it! Okay.
Come out this way a little bit.

466
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:34,001
You're okay. You're okay. You got it.
Keep flapping, keep flapping!

467
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:37,081
Hey, why don't you help
that last little guy?

468
00:39:42,054 --> 00:39:46,582
Okay, okay.
Just smile and establish trust.

469
00:39:47,026 --> 00:39:48,357
Hi, there!

470
00:39:49,228 --> 00:39:53,187
Hey, little fella,
you wanna do some flap-flap today?

471
00:39:54,733 --> 00:39:56,758
Oh, sure you do!

472
00:39:56,869 --> 00:40:00,737
All you do is,
you just flap your wings, like this.

473
00:40:03,409 --> 00:40:06,674
No, no, no. None of that.
Come on. All we got to do is...

474
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:07,768
Ow!

475
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:12,481
Look. I'm going to level with you, okay?

476
00:40:12,585 --> 00:40:16,214
I kind of bombed out on
the whole water and light fairy things,

477
00:40:16,322 --> 00:40:18,688
and I'm starting to
run out of options here.

478
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,316
If you could see fit
to flap your little wings

479
00:40:21,427 --> 00:40:23,793
and take flight
for a few measly seconds,

480
00:40:23,896 --> 00:40:27,297
I might be able to go to the mainland
and bring happiness to the world!

481
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:29,333
What do you say?

482
00:40:30,202 --> 00:40:31,669
Wrong answer.

483
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,872
If I end up making acorn kettles
for the rest of my life,

484
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,966
I am holding you
personally responsible.

485
00:40:39,712 --> 00:40:41,612
Hey, hey. Look at this!

486
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:46,808
Okay, just stop squirming.
Would you just... Hey!

487
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:51,114
Okay, okay, okay.
I'm letting go. I am letting go.

488
00:40:55,894 --> 00:40:57,657
This is not working.

489
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:03,824
Hey, maybe that guy can help.
He's a really good flyer.

490
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:06,804
Hey, up there!

491
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,434
Hawk!

492
00:41:22,321 --> 00:41:23,686
- What's happening?
- Quick, hide!

493
00:41:23,789 --> 00:41:25,051
Look out!

494
00:41:30,796 --> 00:41:33,196
A hawk! Tinker Bell's in trouble!

495
00:41:47,413 --> 00:41:48,675
- Hey!
- Vidia?

496
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:50,681
This is my hiding spot!

497
00:41:52,785 --> 00:41:54,685
But it's all yours, now.

498
00:41:57,423 --> 00:41:58,447
No!

499
00:42:09,368 --> 00:42:12,531
- Get him!
- Get him!

500
00:42:17,976 --> 00:42:20,536
What?
- You all right?

501
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:23,341
So scary.

502
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:32,686
Are you okay, Vidia?

503
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:38,222
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch me! I'm fine!

504
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:41,595
- But I was only trying to help.
- Well, stop trying.

505
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,928
Tinker Bell...

506
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,035
I can't hold water. I can't hold light.

507
00:42:52,144 --> 00:42:55,875
Birds hate me. I'm just so useless!

508
00:42:55,981 --> 00:42:57,175
Tink.

509
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,030
Great.
I failed for the third time in a row.

510
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:18,799
At this rate, I should get to
the mainland right about... Oh... Never!

511
00:43:21,006 --> 00:43:21,973
Huh?

512
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:16,819
Yes!

513
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:26,929
Sil!

514
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,381
Beautiful.

515
00:45:42,114 --> 00:45:43,581
You fixed it!
- Wow!

516
00:45:43,749 --> 00:45:45,580
Beautiful!
- Amazing!

517
00:45:45,684 --> 00:45:46,673
What are you guys doing here?

518
00:45:46,785 --> 00:45:49,652
It might be
the sparkliest thing I've ever seen,

519
00:45:49,755 --> 00:45:51,279
and I've seen a lot of sparkly things!

520
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:55,724
It's a really pretty thingy. What is it?

521
00:45:56,061 --> 00:45:57,756
I don't know. I just found it.

522
00:45:57,863 --> 00:46:02,266
Tinker Bell, don't you even realize
what you're doing? You're tinkering!

523
00:46:02,568 --> 00:46:06,004
What? No, no, this isn't... I was just...

524
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:10,469
Creating those gadgets,
figuring things out, fixing stuff like this,

525
00:46:10,776 --> 00:46:12,539
that's what tinkering is, sweetie!

526
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:16,102
Don't you like doing this?
Isn't it what you really love?

527
00:46:16,214 --> 00:46:18,739
Yeah! Who cares about
going to the mainland, anyway?

528
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,182
Well, I do, remember?

529
00:46:21,853 --> 00:46:24,083
I want to see
where these things come from.

530
00:46:24,189 --> 00:46:26,521
Why are you saying this?
Are you just giving up on me?

531
00:46:26,625 --> 00:46:30,117
I mean, aren't you going to teach me
to be a garden fairy anymore?

532
00:46:30,228 --> 00:46:32,924
Sweet pea, I think this is your talent.

533
00:46:33,532 --> 00:46:35,762
Tink, we just want you to be happy.

534
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:38,802
If you really want me to be happy,
you'll help me get to the mainland

535
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:40,565
like you promised.

536
00:46:41,873 --> 00:46:45,070
Please, Tinker Bell, just think about it.

537
00:47:23,482 --> 00:47:26,576
Will you teach me how to be
a fast-flying fairy?

538
00:47:28,987 --> 00:47:31,182
Please? I know I could do it!

539
00:47:31,323 --> 00:47:35,054
With your help, I could be flying
as fast as you in no time.

540
00:47:35,293 --> 00:47:39,457
Vidia, you're my last hope.
All my friends have given up on me.

541
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:44,697
Rosetta won't even try to teach me
to be a garden fairy now.

542
00:47:45,137 --> 00:47:49,904
I bet I could at least paint some flowers
or plant some sproutlings.

543
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:53,275
I mean,
there must be something I could do.

544
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:59,540
Or if you really want to be
a garden fairy...

545
00:48:10,395 --> 00:48:12,693
Capture the sprinting thistles.

546
00:48:13,799 --> 00:48:17,929
Well, okay. I can do this. Yeah!

547
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:21,868
Okay. Ready, Cheese?

548
00:48:24,643 --> 00:48:26,770
Come on. They're just weeds.

549
00:48:29,214 --> 00:48:32,911
Besides, there were only
seven or eight at the most, right?

550
00:48:37,723 --> 00:48:38,815
Hyah!

551
00:48:43,595 --> 00:48:48,032
We can do this. I know we can do this.
What do you say?

552
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,198
Attaboy.

553
00:49:03,682 --> 00:49:05,547
This ought to be good.

554
00:49:17,929 --> 00:49:19,021
Hey!

555
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:21,691
Come on, you!
Oh, come on!

556
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:26,896
Just a bit this way!
It's working! It's working!

557
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,208
Come on!

558
00:49:43,722 --> 00:49:46,657
Wait, wait, wait.
Come back! Come back!

559
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:54,830
These things just won't listen!
Come on, Cheese. Go, go, go!

560
00:50:00,672 --> 00:50:03,072
Okay, definitely more than eight.

561
00:50:04,943 --> 00:50:08,106
Please file into the corral
in an orderly manner!

562
00:50:11,082 --> 00:50:12,174
Wait!

563
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,785
Oh, no! Come on!

564
00:50:22,928 --> 00:50:24,395
Come on, now.

565
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:36,803
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. So sorry.

566
00:50:36,975 --> 00:50:38,875
This is the last batch.

567
00:50:43,048 --> 00:50:44,310
Look out!

568
00:50:44,716 --> 00:50:46,343
Sorry. Sorry!

569
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:41,332
Oh, no.

570
00:51:41,506 --> 00:51:43,133
Tink. What happened?

571
00:51:43,241 --> 00:51:44,640
- I...
- Tinker Bell,

572
00:51:44,743 --> 00:51:46,142
what did you think you were doing?

573
00:51:46,244 --> 00:51:48,769
I was just... I was just trying to...

574
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,905
I thought if I could capture
the thistles, then...

575
00:51:51,016 --> 00:51:54,679
There isn't a garden fairy alive
who can control those weeds!

576
00:51:54,786 --> 00:51:57,482
- What were you trying to prove?
- I...

577
00:51:57,589 --> 00:52:00,524
She's right, Tink.
This has all gone too far.

578
00:52:04,462 --> 00:52:06,453
By the second star!

579
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:12,431
All the preparations for spring...
How did this...

580
00:52:20,845 --> 00:52:25,839
Queen Clarion, it was me.

581
00:52:26,651 --> 00:52:29,017
I did it. It was all my fault.

582
00:52:30,021 --> 00:52:31,420
Tinker Bell.

583
00:52:32,624 --> 00:52:34,091
I...

584
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,424
I'm sorry.

585
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:54,444
I don't think we can
fix this in time.

586
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,606
We're going to have to cancel spring,
or postpone it at the very least.

587
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:59,980
What, and put my
snowflake fairies back to work? Oh, no.

588
00:53:00,085 --> 00:53:01,677
But we can't! We can't do that!

589
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:02,946
If the snow isn't melted,

590
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:05,147
the seedlings won't grow,
the fruit won't ripen in the summer...

591
00:53:05,256 --> 00:53:07,656
And in the autumn,
there will be nothing to harvest.

592
00:53:07,759 --> 00:53:09,124
Spring must happen on time,

593
00:53:09,227 --> 00:53:10,956
or the balance of nature
will be undone!

594
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,156
There must be something we can do!
Certainly this has happened before!

595
00:53:14,265 --> 00:53:16,495
It has!
Did you ever hear of the Ice Age?

596
00:53:16,601 --> 00:53:18,569
Settle down, all of you.

597
00:53:19,371 --> 00:53:23,808
Fairy Mary, is it even possible to redo
everything in such a short time?

598
00:53:29,914 --> 00:53:32,314
- No.
- Oh, no.

599
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,942
We were so close,
and now it's all gone.

600
00:53:35,053 --> 00:53:36,748
Who's going to paint
our leaves now?

601
00:53:36,855 --> 00:53:38,516
The apples and pumpkins
will never grow.

602
00:53:38,623 --> 00:53:40,614
No rolling hills
covered in daffodils?

603
00:53:40,725 --> 00:53:42,784
And it took months to harvest
all those seeds!

604
00:53:42,894 --> 00:53:44,327
Animals waking
from hibernation

605
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:46,397
will have nothing to eat!

606
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,649
You okay, Tink?

607
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:18,888
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

608
00:54:19,864 --> 00:54:24,824
I just came hoping to get a quick refill.
I'm going away for a while.

609
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,604
Oh.

610
00:54:27,072 --> 00:54:31,168
- Well, how long you going to be gone?
- Well, actually, forever.

611
00:54:33,011 --> 00:54:34,740
Forever? Well,

612
00:54:36,381 --> 00:54:39,043
in that case,
a double scoop.

613
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:42,279
Forever's a pretty long time, so I hear.

614
00:54:42,387 --> 00:54:43,877
Thanks, Terence.

615
00:54:43,988 --> 00:54:45,615
You know my name?

616
00:54:45,723 --> 00:54:48,089
Well, sure. Why wouldn't I?

617
00:54:48,426 --> 00:54:51,156
I don't know.
I'm just a dust-keeper guy.

618
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:55,224
I'm not exactly seen as the most
important fairy in Pixie Hollow.

619
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,233
Terence, what are you talking about?

620
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,769
You're probably the most important one
there is!

621
00:54:59,871 --> 00:55:02,169
Without you,
no one would have any magic!

622
00:55:02,273 --> 00:55:04,969
Why, your talent makes you
who you are!

623
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:08,411
- You should be proud of it! I mean...
- I am.

624
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,055
I'd better get going.

625
00:55:57,328 --> 00:55:58,727
Hey, Cheese.

626
00:56:01,065 --> 00:56:03,795
"Be proud of your talent." What talent?

627
00:56:04,302 --> 00:56:07,362
I couldn't even get
these silly things to work.

628
00:56:20,585 --> 00:56:21,984
Lost things.

629
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,766
That's it!

630
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:50,042
Attention, everyone!

631
00:56:51,749 --> 00:56:54,240
I'm afraid I have distressing news.

632
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:58,651
There is no way spring
can come on time.

633
00:56:59,524 --> 00:57:01,822
Months of work was lost,

634
00:57:01,926 --> 00:57:04,486
and it will take us months
to restore it all.

635
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:07,858
So when the Everblossom
opens tomorrow,

636
00:57:08,233 --> 00:57:11,930
I'm afraid we will not be going
to the mainland for spring.

637
00:57:14,038 --> 00:57:17,007
Wait! I know how we can fix everything!

638
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:19,875
Tinker Bell?

639
00:57:22,547 --> 00:57:24,481
Tinker Bell, I don't think this is...

640
00:57:24,582 --> 00:57:27,517
Just hear me out. Please.

641
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,711
You!

642
00:57:33,024 --> 00:57:35,720
How long does it take you
to paint a ladybug?

643
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:38,728
I don't know. 10, 15 minutes, I guess.

644
00:57:56,481 --> 00:58:00,247
See? We can build more.
I can show you how.

645
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:04,048
Making paint, gathering seeds,
we can do it all in no time.

646
00:58:04,622 --> 00:58:06,590
We have to at least try!

647
00:58:07,425 --> 00:58:10,485
Wait a...
Are we really gonna listen to her?

648
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:13,322
She's the reason we're in this mess
in the first place!

649
00:58:13,431 --> 00:58:15,262
But I can fix it.

650
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:19,962
Yippee! Tinker Bell's going to save us
with her dopey little doohickeys.

651
00:58:20,471 --> 00:58:23,668
- Hide the squirrels!
- What is your problem, Vidia?

652
00:58:23,808 --> 00:58:25,537
Why do you think
you're so much better than me?

653
00:58:25,643 --> 00:58:29,101
I am better than you, sweetie.
I didn't ruin spring.

654
00:58:29,213 --> 00:58:31,306
At least now I'm trying to help.

655
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,850
Have you ever helped anyone
besides yourself?

656
00:58:33,951 --> 00:58:35,748
Well, I tried to help you!

657
00:58:35,853 --> 00:58:37,753
Maybe I should have told you
to capture the hawk

658
00:58:37,855 --> 00:58:39,789
instead of the thistles!

659
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:50,619
Perhaps Tinker Bell was not
the only one responsible.

660
00:58:52,663 --> 00:58:56,360
It seems to me that
your fast-flying talent is well-suited

661
00:58:56,467 --> 00:58:59,868
to chasing down each and every one
of the thistles.

662
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:01,228
Me?

663
00:59:01,472 --> 00:59:05,033
Yes. And I expect them all
to be returned to Needlepoint Meadow

664
00:59:05,142 --> 00:59:06,131
as soon as possible.

665
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:08,643
But that could take forever!

666
00:59:08,746 --> 00:59:11,044
Then I suggest you get started.

667
00:59:20,758 --> 00:59:25,195
Now, Tinker Bell,
are you sure you can do this?

668
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:29,257
Yes.

669
00:59:30,601 --> 00:59:34,230
Because I'm a tinker. It's who I am.

670
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,140
And tinkers fix things.

671
00:59:39,744 --> 00:59:41,712
But I can't do it alone.

672
00:59:45,182 --> 00:59:47,047
Command us, Miss Bell.

673
00:59:47,785 --> 00:59:49,776
- I'll help.
- Show us how, Tink!

674
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,855
- I'll help you.
- Me, too!

675
00:59:52,123 --> 00:59:57,823
Okay, gather up all the twigs you can,
all different sizes, and tree sap.

676
00:59:57,928 --> 01:00:01,295
We need lots of that.
But most importantly,

677
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:04,926
we need to find lost things.

678
01:00:13,711 --> 01:00:15,406
Okay, what have you got?

679
01:00:15,513 --> 01:00:17,504
- How about this?
- Will this do?

680
01:00:17,615 --> 01:00:19,708
Can you use this fuzzy thing,
Miss Bell?

681
01:00:19,817 --> 01:00:21,182
- Oh, yeah!
- It's not fuzzy.

682
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,719
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

683
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:28,252
Twig.

684
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:29,951
Hammer.

685
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:32,928
Magnification, please. Thank you.

686
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:37,100
And that's how you do it!

687
01:00:39,303 --> 01:00:41,567
Now, what do you suppose the...

688
01:00:52,817 --> 01:00:54,409
You smell funny.

689
01:00:56,087 --> 01:00:57,076
Oh!

690
01:00:59,123 --> 01:01:01,523
- I saw it first.
- I bumped into it.

691
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:04,350
Just tie this off here.

692
01:01:04,795 --> 01:01:09,494
So, you just squeeze this,
then let it go, and...

693
01:01:10,801 --> 01:01:12,564
See? Simple!

694
01:01:15,573 --> 01:01:16,801
Now, just put the berries in,

695
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:18,966
and we'll have plenty of paint
in no time!

696
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:58,580
Six, seven and eight.

697
01:02:55,005 --> 01:02:58,497
You did it, Tinker Bell.
You saved spring.

698
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:01,275
We all did it.

699
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:04,541
Queen Clarion? Can't Tink
come with us to the mainland?

700
01:03:04,648 --> 01:03:07,674
Yeah, she's done so much
for everyone.

701
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:11,353
No, no, you guys, really.
I don't need to go.

702
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,113
Buttercup, it's what you wanted.

703
01:03:14,225 --> 01:03:16,785
It's okay. My work is here.

704
01:03:16,894 --> 01:03:18,862
And I still have so much to do. I gotta...

705
01:03:18,963 --> 01:03:20,726
Not here, you don't!

706
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:22,661
Well... But I don't...

707
01:03:24,702 --> 01:03:25,999
Surprise, Miss Bell.

708
01:03:26,103 --> 01:03:29,072
We found your tiny dancer!

709
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:33,940
Actually, I ran across this myself
many seasons ago.

710
01:03:34,545 --> 01:03:37,810
I didn't have a clue what it was
or how to fix it.

711
01:03:38,515 --> 01:03:43,714
But you did, Tinker Bell.
You are quite a rare talent indeed.

712
01:03:44,788 --> 01:03:48,918
And I'd imagine there's a little girl
out there who's missing this.

713
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:51,628
What do you mean? How...

714
01:03:51,729 --> 01:03:54,391
I think that perhaps
a certain tinker fairy

715
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:57,023
might have a job to do after all,

716
01:03:57,134 --> 01:03:58,431
on the mainland.

717
01:03:58,535 --> 01:04:00,059
You mean, I...

718
01:04:03,807 --> 01:04:05,104
I knew you'd get to go!
- Oh, Tink!

719
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:07,268
- We can help, Miss Bell.
- We can help. I'm strong.

720
01:04:07,378 --> 01:04:10,609
I'm so happy for you.
Come on. We gotta go line up.

721
01:04:11,682 --> 01:04:13,650
Thank you, Your Highness.

722
01:04:13,751 --> 01:04:16,219
But how will I find who it belongs to?

723
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:18,220
You'll know. Now go!

724
01:04:26,363 --> 01:04:27,830
Good heavens.

725
01:04:28,632 --> 01:04:29,929
Thank you.

726
01:04:35,506 --> 01:04:38,669
Tink. Hey,
something to help you on the mainland.

727
01:04:40,911 --> 01:04:42,902
Terence, that's so sweet.

728
01:04:45,516 --> 01:04:47,108
Good luck, Tink.

729
01:04:47,518 --> 01:04:51,477
To the air, fairies! To the air!
The mainland awaits!

730
01:04:53,157 --> 01:04:58,060
<i>Come away</i>
<i>with me now to the sky</i>

731
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:02,064
<i>Up o'er the hills and the sea</i>

732
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:06,569
<i>Far beyond where our memories lie</i>

733
01:05:06,670 --> 01:05:10,970
<i>To a place where I'm free to be me</i>

734
01:05:13,344 --> 01:05:17,178
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

735
01:05:17,281 --> 01:05:21,980
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

736
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:26,853
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

737
01:05:26,957 --> 01:05:31,860
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

738
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:38,030
<i>The blanket of snow is all gone</i>

739
01:05:38,135 --> 01:05:42,003
<i>Each flower waits for the sun</i>

740
01:05:42,106 --> 01:05:46,566
<i>And the whispering tears of the rain</i>

741
01:05:46,677 --> 01:05:51,114
<i>Holds promise for everyone</i>

742
01:05:51,215 --> 01:05:55,049
<i>Then come away with me friends</i>

743
01:05:55,152 --> 01:05:59,646
<i>No matter where you call your home</i>

744
01:05:59,757 --> 01:06:03,523
<i>With a light in our hearts</i>
<i>We will never part</i>

745
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,492
Fairies to the north!

746
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,930
Fairies to the south!

747
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:09,895
To the east and west!

748
01:06:20,778 --> 01:06:24,874
<i>Deep in the forest we go</i>

749
01:06:24,982 --> 01:06:26,313
<i>The creatures are all fast asleep</i>

750
01:06:26,417 --> 01:06:30,979
Wake up, sleepyheads!
Come on! There you go. Good squirrel.

751
01:06:31,088 --> 01:06:32,851
<i>With a kiss and a wink</i>
<i>we will waken our souls</i>

752
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:36,551
<i>While always their safety we'll keep</i>

753
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:40,460
<i>And then, then we'll dance</i>
<i>through the night</i>

754
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:44,795
<i>Till the sunbeams sparkle at dawn</i>

755
01:06:44,902 --> 01:06:49,305
<i>And away we will go</i>
<i>Like last winter's snow</i>

756
01:06:49,406 --> 01:06:52,967
<i>Soon our work will be done</i>

757
01:06:53,077 --> 01:06:56,877
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

758
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,939
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

759
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:05,545
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

760
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:11,922
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

761
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:29,334
<i>Oh gather ye now one and all</i>

762
01:07:29,446 --> 01:07:33,473
<i>No matter what all ye may do</i>

763
01:07:33,584 --> 01:07:38,214
<i>Let the stars fill your soul</i>
<i>when the moon cradles all</i>

764
01:07:38,322 --> 01:07:42,725
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

765
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:56,295
<i>So to yourself be true</i>

766
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:55,019
Mummy! Guess what, guess what!

767
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,524
Yes, Wendy.
What is it, darling?

768
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:05,998
<i>A fairy's work is</i>
<i>much more than,</i>

769
01:10:06,103 --> 01:10:07,161
<i>at first, it might appear.</i>

770
01:10:07,271 --> 01:10:08,636
You did it!

771
01:10:09,539 --> 01:10:13,168
<i>Suppose your broken clock ticks,</i>
<i>though it hasn't in a year.</i>

772
01:10:14,378 --> 01:10:18,838
<i>Perchance you find a toy you lost,</i>
<i>or jingling bells you hear.</i>

773
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:26,987
<i>It all means that</i>
<i>one very special fairy might be near.</i>

774
01:10:43,807 --> 01:10:48,005
<i>Watch all the flowers</i>
<i>dance with the wind</i>

775
01:10:48,111 --> 01:10:52,480
<i>Listen to snowflakes</i>
<i>whisper your name</i>

776
01:10:52,582 --> 01:10:56,109
<i>Feel all the wonder lifting your dreams</i>

777
01:10:56,219 --> 01:11:01,088
<i>You can fly</i>

778
01:11:01,191 --> 01:11:05,355
<i>Fly to who you are</i>

779
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:09,523
<i>Climb upon your star</i>

780
01:11:09,633 --> 01:11:13,967
<i>You believe you'll find your wings</i>

781
01:11:14,071 --> 01:11:21,000
<i>Fly to your heart</i>

782
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:26,806
<i>Touch every rainbow painting the sky</i>

783
01:11:26,917 --> 01:11:31,047
<i>Look at the magic glide</i>
<i>through your life</i>

784
01:11:31,154 --> 01:11:34,817
<i>A sprinkle of pixie dust circles the night</i>

785
01:11:34,925 --> 01:11:39,760
<i>You can fly</i>

786
01:11:39,863 --> 01:11:44,163
