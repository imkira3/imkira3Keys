1
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,633
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

2
00:01:26,477 --> 00:01:27,477
Private Miller...

3
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:30,688
...you've been smoking Item 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

4
00:01:30,855 --> 00:01:32,814
We're going to ask you
several questions.

5
00:01:32,982 --> 00:01:33,982
How do you feel?

6
00:01:34,984 --> 00:01:36,401
Well, sir...

7
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:38,319
...I feel like a...

8
00:01:39,196 --> 00:01:41,530
Like a slice of butter...

9
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:48,121
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

10
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:51,750
Yeah.

11
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:55,295
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

12
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,340
...what emotions do you feel?

13
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:07,015
Okay, Private Miller?

14
00:02:10,645 --> 00:02:11,687
Is this normal?

15
00:02:11,854 --> 00:02:13,522
Okay, Private...

16
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:16,441
Okay, Private Miller?

17
00:02:16,609 --> 00:02:18,193
Private Miller.

18
00:02:21,698 --> 00:02:23,241
Answer the question.

19
00:02:29,414 --> 00:02:30,539
This went out, sir.

20
00:02:30,707 --> 00:02:33,375
Can you torch me?

21
00:02:33,543 --> 00:02:35,168
We'll send someone in.

22
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,504
Holy bejesus!

23
00:02:44,137 --> 00:02:47,055
Private Miller, answer the question.

24
00:02:47,223 --> 00:02:48,765
What was the question again, sir?

25
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:53,395
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

26
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,314
You know what problem I have...

27
00:02:55,481 --> 00:02:58,817
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

28
00:02:58,985 --> 00:03:02,363
Here it is. One: Lots of dudes.

29
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:03,948
Where are the boobies?

30
00:03:04,116 --> 00:03:07,577
Two: Why are We
underground right now, sir?

31
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:10,913
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

32
00:03:11,081 --> 00:03:14,415
Why aren't we talking to people,
letting them know Item 9 exists?

33
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,126
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

34
00:03:17,294 --> 00:03:21,798
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees, Item 9!"

35
00:03:21,966 --> 00:03:23,633
Private, we need you to be serious.

36
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,554
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

37
00:03:31,642 --> 00:03:33,393
That's inappropriate.

38
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:42,695
Fuck you!

39
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:46,531
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

40
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:50,285
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

41
00:03:50,453 --> 00:03:51,787
This never happened.

42
00:03:51,954 --> 00:03:53,580
Dude, what happened to your eye?

43
00:03:54,207 --> 00:03:55,791
Hello.

44
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:58,126
Can you guys understand me?

45
00:03:58,294 --> 00:04:01,172
- Hey. Hey, where we going?
- This is General Brat.

46
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:04,132
We've reached
a final conclusion on Item 9.

47
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:06,385
Illegal!

48
00:04:06,552 --> 00:04:08,011
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.

49
00:04:08,179 --> 00:04:09,346
Welcome to KRAD.

50
00:04:09,514 --> 00:04:12,474
You know, I think that last caller
had some undeniable points.

51
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:15,310
Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton.

52
00:04:15,478 --> 00:04:17,396
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

53
00:04:19,315 --> 00:04:20,899
- Here's my piece.
- All right.

54
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,819
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

55
00:04:23,986 --> 00:04:27,072
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

56
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,074
Everyone likes smoking weed.

57
00:04:29,242 --> 00:04:32,661
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

58
00:04:32,829 --> 00:04:34,996
It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.

59
00:04:35,164 --> 00:04:37,499
It makes sex feel better,
for God's sakes.

60
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:40,503
It makes shitty movies better,
you know?

61
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,805
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

62
00:04:51,973 --> 00:04:53,013
Yeah.

63
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:57,810
Well, I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

64
00:04:57,978 --> 00:04:59,229
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

65
00:04:59,397 --> 00:05:01,606
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

66
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,569
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

67
00:05:05,736 --> 00:05:08,238
- Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole.
- Sorry.

68
00:05:08,406 --> 00:05:10,991
I'm just saying love has no age.

69
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:14,369
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

70
00:05:14,537 --> 00:05:16,496
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

71
00:05:16,664 --> 00:05:18,040
I'm dating a high-school girl.

72
00:05:18,208 --> 00:05:21,961
You're not maximizing your potential.
Think this girl takes you seriously?

73
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:25,506
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

74
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,716
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

75
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:31,011
- Hey, as long as it's consensual.
- I think it's consensual.

76
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:34,139
Yo, you been served.

77
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:37,726
You've been served.
You've been served.

78
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,978
You've been served.

79
00:05:47,278 --> 00:05:49,070
Walter Wadska the third.

80
00:05:49,238 --> 00:05:51,573
You here to fix the fax machine?

81
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:54,993
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

82
00:05:55,161 --> 00:05:57,538
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

83
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:06,588
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

84
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:15,972
- Hey, "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

85
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:20,353
- Take that shit to the next level, eh?
- Okay, I will.

86
00:06:31,781 --> 00:06:34,406
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

87
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:37,077
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

88
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:39,287
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

89
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:42,040
And nowbecause of that,
you've been served.

90
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,291
You're a jerk.

91
00:06:43,459 --> 00:06:45,460
All this current system is doing...

92
00:06:45,628 --> 00:06:47,879
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

93
00:06:48,047 --> 00:06:51,758
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

94
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:55,388
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

95
00:06:55,556 --> 00:06:57,557
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

96
00:06:57,724 --> 00:07:01,686
Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please.

97
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:16,116
I can't come.

98
00:07:16,993 --> 00:07:18,493
What?

99
00:07:19,328 --> 00:07:20,662
Why the fuck not, Dale?

100
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,163
I just... Look, I can't come.

101
00:07:22,331 --> 00:07:25,083
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

102
00:07:25,251 --> 00:07:28,420
Jesus Christ, Dale.
When Were you gonna tell me?

103
00:07:28,588 --> 00:07:30,130
My mom has been shopping all day.

104
00:07:30,298 --> 00:07:32,173
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

105
00:07:32,341 --> 00:07:35,344
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

106
00:07:35,512 --> 00:07:37,513
- How I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

107
00:07:37,681 --> 00:07:40,390
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

108
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:42,017
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

109
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:43,643
Don't come. I don't care.

110
00:07:43,811 --> 00:07:47,105
Then Why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

111
00:07:47,273 --> 00:07:49,524
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

112
00:07:49,692 --> 00:07:53,320
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

113
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:55,990
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

114
00:07:56,158 --> 00:07:58,326
You're great, and you're funny...

115
00:07:58,493 --> 00:08:00,369
...and you're sexy.

116
00:08:00,787 --> 00:08:02,996
I just want them to see that.

117
00:08:03,164 --> 00:08:05,832
- You Want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey, people?

118
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,542
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

119
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,711
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

120
00:08:09,879 --> 00:08:12,881
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

121
00:08:13,049 --> 00:08:16,051
- I'm with her, actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

122
00:08:17,261 --> 00:08:20,513
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

123
00:08:20,681 --> 00:08:22,015
What's that supposed to mean?

124
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:25,810
I'm just wondering Why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

125
00:08:25,978 --> 00:08:27,937
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

126
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,689
- Angie, hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

127
00:08:29,857 --> 00:08:31,900
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

128
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:34,862
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

129
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,656
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

130
00:08:36,823 --> 00:08:38,699
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

131
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:41,410
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

132
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:43,079
I wish.

133
00:08:43,997 --> 00:08:45,831
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

134
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:48,541
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

135
00:08:48,709 --> 00:08:50,084
Oh, yeah.

136
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:51,669
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

137
00:08:51,836 --> 00:08:53,254
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

138
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:54,881
- Can you hold those?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:55,049 --> 00:08:57,092
- Yeah.
- How's it going, Sporty Spice?

140
00:08:57,259 --> 00:08:58,551
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

141
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,178
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- You too.

142
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:02,472
I've heard so much about you.
You're real cool.

143
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,891
- I mean, you're great. Yeah.

Anyways, yeah, dude, next year.

Gonna be kick-ass.
I will watch her back for you.

146
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,403
I know there's tons of guys that are
gonna be trying to get on that shit.

147
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:17,446
- Oh, good.
- Because I got that... Yeah.

148
00:09:17,614 --> 00:09:19,281
You got her ass? Perfect.

of Angela, man.

156
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,969
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

157
00:09:41,137 --> 00:09:43,388
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

158
00:09:43,556 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

159
00:09:45,808 --> 00:09:48,101
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I Want...

160
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:50,520
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
- Actually...

161
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:53,482
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

162
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,316
...or I call the liaison officer.

163
00:09:55,484 --> 00:09:58,653
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

164
00:09:58,821 --> 00:09:59,821
What a jerk.

165
00:09:59,989 --> 00:10:01,740
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

166
00:10:01,907 --> 00:10:04,951
I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

167
00:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,121
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

168
00:10:08,289 --> 00:10:11,167
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

169
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:13,210
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

170
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:15,755
Yeah, I Wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

171
00:10:15,922 --> 00:10:17,673
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

172
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:19,675
That means so much to me
and my parents.

173
00:10:19,843 --> 00:10:22,845
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

174
00:10:24,014 --> 00:10:27,015
- Hello?
- Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?

175
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,210
- Come on down.
- Sweet. Be there.

176
00:10:30,378 --> 00:10:32,045
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

177
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:34,840
I thought the hurricane season
was over.

178
00:10:35,007 --> 00:10:36,675
I thought hurricane season
was over.

179
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,635
I'm sorry.
Things just got out of hand.

180
00:10:38,803 --> 00:10:41,179
Yeah, that's the way it was
with my first husband.

181
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,059
Hello? Hey, man.

182
00:10:46,227 --> 00:10:47,978
What the fuck, man?

183
00:10:48,145 --> 00:10:50,773
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

184
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:54,110
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when I...

185
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:56,404
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

186
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,197
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

187
00:10:58,365 --> 00:11:00,408
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

188
00:11:00,576 --> 00:11:04,077
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't knowyour protocol yet.

189
00:11:04,245 --> 00:11:06,496
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

190
00:11:06,664 --> 00:11:09,625
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

191
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,794
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

192
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,170
Yo, check this out.

193
00:11:16,507 --> 00:11:19,259
Satellite radio.

194
00:11:19,427 --> 00:11:22,387
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

195
00:11:22,555 --> 00:11:23,847
That's home entertainment.

196
00:11:24,015 --> 00:11:27,225
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

197
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:29,520
Oh, yeah. Me and my bubbe.

198
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,606
Hey, let me ask you something.

199
00:11:31,773 --> 00:11:33,107
Yeah?

200
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:37,485
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

201
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,738
Like, euthanasia?

202
00:11:41,866 --> 00:11:43,909
Like, on her?

203
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:45,911
If I needed to.

204
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,876
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

205
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,712
I don't knowif we should
start going down that road.

206
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,840
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

207
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,550
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

208
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,052
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

209
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:03,637
Business for the businessman.

210
00:12:03,804 --> 00:12:05,931
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

211
00:12:06,098 --> 00:12:07,516
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

212
00:12:07,684 --> 00:12:11,102
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

213
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:13,146
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

214
00:12:13,314 --> 00:12:16,399
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

215
00:12:16,567 --> 00:12:21,237
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

216
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:22,864
...and they had a baby.

217
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:25,867
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

218
00:12:26,035 --> 00:12:29,705
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

219
00:12:29,873 --> 00:12:33,334
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

220
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,712
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

221
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,215
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

222
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,675
- Smell it.
- Okay.

223
00:12:40,842 --> 00:12:43,176
Smell it. Enjoy.

224
00:12:43,344 --> 00:12:46,514
It's like God's vagina.

225
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,516
What, you wanna bathe in it?

226
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:51,559
- I wanna live in here.
- You Wanna be it?

227
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:54,854
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smell all day.

228
00:12:55,022 --> 00:12:57,107
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

229
00:12:57,274 --> 00:12:58,566
Beautiful. What's it called?

230
00:12:58,734 --> 00:13:00,860
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

231
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:03,029
It's this thing, like, El Niño.

232
00:13:03,197 --> 00:13:06,200
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

233
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:09,245
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

234
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,747
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

235
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:14,583
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

236
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:16,334
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

237
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:18,211
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

238
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:20,380
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

239
00:13:20,548 --> 00:13:21,881
Let me get my scale.

240
00:13:22,049 --> 00:13:25,428
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

241
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:29,390
I thought hurricane season
was over.

242
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,643
Oh, crow.

243
00:13:34,896 --> 00:13:37,772
Where are you, you little fucker?

244
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:42,402
What the fuck is this thing?

245
00:13:43,654 --> 00:13:45,072
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

246
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,575
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

247
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,826
- Yeah, man.
- No.

248
00:13:48,993 --> 00:13:51,077
This is the future.

249
00:13:51,245 --> 00:13:56,082
This is, like, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

250
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,502
It's rumored that M. M. O,Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

251
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:02,255
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

252
00:14:02,423 --> 00:14:04,675
My second favorite civil engineer...

253
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:08,721
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

254
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,683
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

255
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:16,103
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

256
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:20,357
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

257
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,777
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

258
00:14:23,945 --> 00:14:25,945
Future. The future.

259
00:14:26,113 --> 00:14:28,656
That's amazing.
Well, got the weed?

260
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:31,743
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

261
00:14:32,411 --> 00:14:35,830
Be careful with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

262
00:14:35,998 --> 00:14:37,791
Alrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

263
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,751
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

264
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:42,045
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

265
00:14:42,213 --> 00:14:43,964
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

266
00:14:44,132 --> 00:14:45,966
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...

267
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:48,260
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

268
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:51,347
Yeah, I need your help, man.

269
00:14:51,973 --> 00:14:53,808
- I'm in.
- Come on!

270
00:14:53,975 --> 00:14:56,768
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

271
00:14:56,936 --> 00:14:58,812
Why not? What do I do?

272
00:14:58,979 --> 00:15:00,146
Okay, here's What you do.

273
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:02,023
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

274
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,609
- Equip me, sir.
- Okay.

275
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:08,656
You are going to light these tWo ends
while I light this end.

276
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,574
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

277
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,618
- Ready.
- Blast off.

278
00:15:29,718 --> 00:15:32,345
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

279
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,860
It's better to cough.

280
00:15:46,027 --> 00:15:47,570
It's like...

281
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:49,363
Makes you 10 times more higher...

282
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:51,782
...than the cross Weed
and the Pineapple Express.

283
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:55,744
You're like,
totally fucking Gong Show,ed, man.

284
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:10,091
Oh, fuck.

285
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:11,718
Hang on one second, man.

286
00:16:11,886 --> 00:16:12,927
Oh, you fucker.

287
00:16:17,892 --> 00:16:19,100
Who is it?

288
00:16:19,268 --> 00:16:21,103
It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.

289
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,479
Shit.

290
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,231
What's a Gebert?

291
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,983
Come on up.

292
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,486
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

293
00:16:29,654 --> 00:16:34,033
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

294
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:37,327
Hey.

295
00:16:37,494 --> 00:16:39,495
So listen, man.

296
00:16:39,663 --> 00:16:42,082
I gotta ask you. So...

297
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:46,212
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, like, tWo months, right?

298
00:16:46,379 --> 00:16:48,672
- Two months.
- I gotta ask, man.

299
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,381
What's up with the suit?

300
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:53,343
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

301
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,889
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

302
00:16:58,057 --> 00:17:01,268
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No, I'm not...

303
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:04,521
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

304
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:06,190
- I like...
- In process.

305
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,317
I work for a company
that's, like, hired...

306
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:10,485
...by lawyers to hand out
legal documents.

307
00:17:10,653 --> 00:17:12,779
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

308
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:16,783
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

309
00:17:16,951 --> 00:17:19,202
...so I can serve them the papers.

310
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,412
Disguise.

311
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,705
Kind of, I guess.

312
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:23,916
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

313
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:28,254
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

314
00:17:28,421 --> 00:17:29,880
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

315
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:32,549
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

316
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:34,343
Nice.

317
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:36,970
What? You sucked on her titties?

318
00:17:37,137 --> 00:17:40,182
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

319
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,851
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

320
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:45,144
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

321
00:17:45,312 --> 00:17:48,064
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

322
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,066
She's cool as hell, actually.

323
00:17:50,234 --> 00:17:51,985
- You'd get along With her.
- Really?

324
00:17:52,152 --> 00:17:54,862
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

325
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:58,784
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

326
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,370
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

327
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:04,415
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

328
00:18:04,582 --> 00:18:09,586
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

329
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,964
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

330
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,508
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

331
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,344
You know, don't get down on yourself.
You got a great girl.

332
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:19,930
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

333
00:18:20,098 --> 00:18:22,224
You get to smoke weed all day.

334
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,767
I wish I had that.

335
00:18:23,935 --> 00:18:27,270
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

336
00:18:27,438 --> 00:18:30,523
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

337
00:18:30,691 --> 00:18:33,151
You didn't think of that.

338
00:18:33,319 --> 00:18:35,361
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

339
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:36,779
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

340
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:38,574
Thank you.

341
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,869
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

342
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,872
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

343
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,540
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

344
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,126
He sees that, he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

345
00:18:50,961 --> 00:18:52,503
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

346
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:54,005
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

347
00:18:54,173 --> 00:18:55,465
All right, homes. Good.

348
00:18:55,632 --> 00:18:57,760
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

349
00:18:57,927 --> 00:18:59,887
You got the dough? There you go.

350
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,222
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

351
00:19:02,724 --> 00:19:04,767
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

352
00:19:04,934 --> 00:19:07,269
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

353
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,479
- Chris.
- Chris.

354
00:19:08,646 --> 00:19:10,397
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

355
00:19:10,565 --> 00:19:13,066
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

356
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,443
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well, I...

357
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:17,529
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

358
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:20,574
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

359
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:21,992
- Thank...
- God.

360
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,161
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

361
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,162
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

362
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,705
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

363
00:19:27,873 --> 00:19:29,374
Fuck.

364
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:32,085
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

365
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:35,880
If there's one quality
I hate in a person, it's lingering.

366
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,759
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

367
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,179
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

368
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,431
...and process and service?

369
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:47,101
I don't know. It's alWays
something different, I guess.

370
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,560
This guy...

371
00:19:48,728 --> 00:19:51,438
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

372
00:19:51,606 --> 00:19:53,857
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

373
00:19:54,025 --> 00:19:57,821
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

374
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,905
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

375
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,114
That'd be weird.

376
00:20:01,281 --> 00:20:03,825
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

377
00:20:03,992 --> 00:20:07,537
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

378
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,039
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

379
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,834
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

380
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:16,046
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

381
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:19,341
That sounds appealing, but I think
I should probably just get going.

382
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:20,926
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah.

383
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,387
That's cool, man.
What are you doing this weekend?

384
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,473
Because, you know, my bubbe's
got season tickets to the opera...

385
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:29,810
...and she can't make it,
so wanna go see Phantom?

386
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,854
- Of the Opera?
- Yeah.

387
00:20:34,064 --> 00:20:36,483
I can't this weekend,
but you know what? Here.

388
00:20:36,651 --> 00:20:40,362
You know... I'll run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

389
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:43,323
- We'll watch 227 and shit.
- Definitely.

390
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,367
Cool, man. Well, thanks.
Good to see you.

391
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:46,702
- Peace, brother.
- Okay.

392
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,370
One love.

393
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,707
When you got behind
on the mortgage...

394
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,667
...someone finally
made you a loan?

395
00:20:52,835 --> 00:20:53,918
Yes, he did.

396
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,714
Yes, he did.
What was the interest rate you gotu

397
00:20:56,882 --> 00:21:01,469
- It was 12 or 13 percent.
- That's disgusting.

398
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:12,979
- Hello?
- Hello.

399
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:14,774
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

400
00:21:14,941 --> 00:21:18,402
I just talked to my mom, and they are
so excited you're coming for dinner.

401
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:21,739
Like, so excited. And so am I,
but we're all really excited.

402
00:21:21,907 --> 00:21:22,907
Thank you so much.

403
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,409
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

404
00:21:25,577 --> 00:21:29,246
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

405
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:34,127
Dale, anyway, I can't wait
for next year when this bullshit's over.

406
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:37,213
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

407
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,297
Fucking cops. Shit.

408
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,223
Jesus.

409
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:55,439
What an adorable little cop.

410
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:57,525
Weird.

411
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,948
Jesus. Fuck.

412
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:06,117
What the fuck was that?

413
00:22:06,284 --> 00:22:07,576
Oh, shit.

414
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:11,414
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

415
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:12,623
Oh, no!

416
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,762
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

417
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:29,931
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

418
00:23:00,255 --> 00:23:01,839
Pineapple Express.

419
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,968
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

420
00:23:06,136 --> 00:23:07,636
I sawbrains and blood!

421
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,263
Come on! Come on!

422
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:10,515
Where do I go?

423
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:27,947
Hello?

424
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,866
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

425
00:23:30,035 --> 00:23:32,495
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

426
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:35,456
- It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man?
- Dale?

427
00:23:35,624 --> 00:23:38,250
Yes, Dale. That's what I said.
It's Dale. Let me in.

428
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,503
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

429
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:46,675
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

430
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,677
Buzz it in three seconds exactly.

431
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,306
One, two...

432
00:23:51,474 --> 00:23:53,516
- Did it work?
- On three!

433
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:56,519
I did it on three.
On "one, two, three, go"?

434
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:58,437
Just on three.

435
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,033
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey, I got neighbors.

436
00:24:11,201 --> 00:24:12,660
He fucking killed him.

437
00:24:12,827 --> 00:24:15,788
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

438
00:24:15,956 --> 00:24:19,083
A cop, a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

439
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:21,252
No, it was just a guy.

440
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,087
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

441
00:24:23,255 --> 00:24:27,924
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

442
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:31,095
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

443
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,846
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

444
00:24:33,014 --> 00:24:35,099
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

445
00:24:35,267 --> 00:24:37,017
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

446
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:40,104
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

447
00:24:40,272 --> 00:24:41,730
What?

448
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,192
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

449
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,777
You threw up on my printer.

450
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,279
- I did.
- Did you break it?

451
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:50,364
- I hope not.
- Listen, man.

452
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,032
I think the guy was Ted.

453
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,034
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

454
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:56,120
...so you sawTed
capping the competition.

455
00:24:56,288 --> 00:24:58,122
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

456
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,957
What? They saw you?

457
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,457
And you fucking came here?

458
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,626
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

459
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:08,048
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

460
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:10,926
I sawthem kill him.

461
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:13,804
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

462
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:16,140
I tossed my roach.

463
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,767
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

464
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:22,062
So they must have heard...
They knowsomeone was out there.

465
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,356
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

466
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,152
They don't know it was you. Right?

467
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,739
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

468
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,490
- Yes.
- I hope not.

469
00:25:32,658 --> 00:25:33,699
Relax.

470
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:38,661
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

471
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:42,665
Is it really that rare?

472
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:45,168
It's, like, the rarest.

473
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,838
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

474
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:51,967
It's like killing a unicorn...

475
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,844
...with, like, a bomb.

476
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,307
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

477
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:00,601
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

478
00:26:00,769 --> 00:26:04,355
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

479
00:26:04,522 --> 00:26:07,608
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

480
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,861
Yeah. So We're, like, the only guys.

481
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:12,863
And Red got this from Ted?

482
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,365
Ted's the man.

483
00:26:15,033 --> 00:26:18,077
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

484
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,579
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

485
00:26:20,747 --> 00:26:22,748
So what? I throw roaches
all over town.

486
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:26,335
No. He could find the roach
and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

487
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,712
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

488
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,964
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

489
00:26:31,132 --> 00:26:32,549
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

490
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,552
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

491
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,889
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

492
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,182
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

493
00:27:00,245 --> 00:27:02,413
Red said he'd be here.

494
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:12,381
Them some drugs.

495
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:16,089
Smells like vomit in this house.

496
00:27:16,256 --> 00:27:18,132
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

497
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,468
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

498
00:27:20,636 --> 00:27:22,303
Smell it on my sweater.

499
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:23,930
For real?

500
00:27:24,099 --> 00:27:25,391
Yeah, for real.

501
00:27:25,558 --> 00:27:28,352
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

502
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,603
Not my style.

503
00:27:29,771 --> 00:27:32,106
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

504
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:34,733
You have reached
the voice mailbox of...

505
00:27:34,901 --> 00:27:36,527
- Ted.
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.

506
00:27:36,695 --> 00:27:39,488
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

507
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:43,702
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew We Were coming.

508
00:27:43,869 --> 00:27:44,994
They not here, Ted.

509
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:46,871
Hi, Ted.

510
00:27:47,456 --> 00:27:49,748
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

511
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:51,792
I think he's crazy about murdering.

512
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,294
Jesus, man.
Well, how much money do you have?

513
00:27:54,462 --> 00:27:57,631
- I have, like, the 75 that you gave me.
- That's it?

514
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,675
- Well, howmuch do you have?
- Three bucks.

515
00:27:59,842 --> 00:28:02,427
What you getting on my case for?
I have more than you.

516
00:28:02,594 --> 00:28:06,348
Well, that's my 75 technically.
So I have $78 and you have nothing.

517
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:10,894
I don't know. Let's just go... Go to
a motel or a hotel and just hide out.

518
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:14,648
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

519
00:28:15,275 --> 00:28:18,819
Shit. I wish We could
just go nowhere.

520
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:22,113
Okay.

521
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:27,995
Even if he found that roach,
how could he knowwhere you are?

522
00:28:29,456 --> 00:28:31,290
Heat-seeking missiles.

523
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,126
Bloodhounds.

524
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,712
Foxes.

525
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,505
Barracudas.

526
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:41,884
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's Weird.

527
00:28:42,052 --> 00:28:43,094
Thank you.

528
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:45,305
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

529
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,390
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

530
00:28:47,558 --> 00:28:51,769
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

531
00:28:51,936 --> 00:28:55,271
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

532
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:57,315
Only Red knows, man.

533
00:28:57,483 --> 00:28:58,900
Who is Red?

534
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:02,738
Red's, like, the middleman
between, like, Ted and me.

535
00:29:02,906 --> 00:29:04,990
And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

536
00:29:05,158 --> 00:29:07,242
One time, he got this girl...

537
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,829
...to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

538
00:29:10,997 --> 00:29:15,542
It was like, "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

539
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:20,881
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

540
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:23,218
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

541
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:26,012
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

542
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:28,889
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

543
00:29:29,057 --> 00:29:32,643
Fucking hand job, Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

544
00:29:32,811 --> 00:29:36,646
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

545
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:39,273
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

546
00:29:41,277 --> 00:29:45,072
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

547
00:29:45,865 --> 00:29:48,367
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

548
00:29:48,535 --> 00:29:52,496
You know? Just ignore What I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

549
00:29:52,664 --> 00:29:54,289
See what the dealio is.

550
00:29:58,002 --> 00:29:59,795
- Hello.
- Hey, Red, you okay?

551
00:29:59,963 --> 00:30:03,090
Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.
I just stubbed my toe.

552
00:30:03,258 --> 00:30:06,260
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

553
00:30:06,427 --> 00:30:09,429
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, listen.

554
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:12,099
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

555
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:14,935
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

556
00:30:15,103 --> 00:30:16,395
I'd never talk to anyone...

557
00:30:16,563 --> 00:30:20,775
...about the stuft that I do with you
involving drugs.

558
00:30:20,943 --> 00:30:23,444
All right, cool.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

559
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,445
I gotta lay some shit on you.

560
00:30:25,613 --> 00:30:27,239
There is a fly in the ointment.

561
00:30:27,407 --> 00:30:29,950
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

562
00:30:30,118 --> 00:30:32,452
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

563
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,122
- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- Perfect.

564
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:38,291
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

565
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:40,919
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

566
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:43,505
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

567
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:44,715
- Who?
- I don't know.

568
00:30:44,883 --> 00:30:46,508
He's whispering to another man.

569
00:30:46,676 --> 00:30:49,511
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

570
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,181
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

571
00:30:53,349 --> 00:30:55,767
- Hey.
- So you're coming by tomorrow?

572
00:30:55,935 --> 00:30:56,977
How'd you know that?

573
00:30:57,145 --> 00:31:01,024
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

574
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:03,818
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

575
00:31:03,986 --> 00:31:06,821
...because my bubbe... Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.

576
00:31:06,989 --> 00:31:09,489
Is that the bubbe
that's on 41 st and River Street?

577
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:12,074
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

578
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:14,869
You got it. So, listen,
we'll be chilling by noon.

579
00:31:15,329 --> 00:31:18,165
- Noon it is, bromosexual.
- Nice.

580
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:21,001
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

581
00:31:21,169 --> 00:31:23,837
Okay, yeah.
We'll definitely hit the casino up.

582
00:31:24,005 --> 00:31:27,299
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

583
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:29,343
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

584
00:31:29,510 --> 00:31:31,386
- Why'd he mention a casino?
- I don't know.

585
00:31:31,554 --> 00:31:34,348
You make me call my good
friend, send him into a booby trap.

586
00:31:34,515 --> 00:31:36,183
- And lie to him.
- Is Saul Asian?

587
00:31:36,351 --> 00:31:38,353
- Making me a shitty person.
- Is he Asian?

588
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,896
- He's not Asian.
- You're lying.

589
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,607
- I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
- You're lying.

590
00:31:42,774 --> 00:31:44,316
Did you hear slot machines?

591
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:47,110
- Man, I don't know where he is.
- You tell me Where he is.

592
00:31:47,278 --> 00:31:50,155
Tell me. In 45 minutes,
I gotta go have dinner with my wife.

593
00:31:50,323 --> 00:31:51,907
- I got a reservation.
- Forty-five?

594
00:31:52,075 --> 00:31:54,242
That's a dinner reservation
you gonna miss.

595
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,869
That's a reservation I'll make.

596
00:31:56,037 --> 00:31:58,456
- I don't think so.
- Because if he doesn't start to...

597
00:31:58,624 --> 00:32:02,709
- Look, can you do this one solo?
- No, I can't do this solo. Are you crazy?

598
00:32:02,877 --> 00:32:06,505
- What are you talking about? What?
- What, you trying to abandon me?

599
00:32:06,673 --> 00:32:09,758
This is teamwork. This is a
partnership. We are in this together.

600
00:32:09,926 --> 00:32:11,551
- You want me to stay?
- Yes.

601
00:32:11,719 --> 00:32:13,053
- Fine, I'll stay.
- Thank you.

602
00:32:13,221 --> 00:32:15,222
- You happy now?
- Yes.

603
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,683
There's no way that
we could pause for a minute...

604
00:32:17,850 --> 00:32:19,184
...you guys go home...

605
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:22,479
...and then tomorrow we
could just, like, continue?

606
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,405
I should call Angie soon.

607
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,616
Make up some bullshit.

608
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:33,867
I'm cold.

609
00:32:34,035 --> 00:32:37,122
You're cold?
Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

610
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,289
I run hot.

611
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:39,791
- Really?
- Yeah.

612
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:43,253
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

613
00:32:43,421 --> 00:32:46,631
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

614
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:49,049
I'm gonna call Angie.

615
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,307
Space.

616
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,894
Dale, wait. Wait.

617
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:04,648
The phones. The phones.

618
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,109
- You said they Were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

619
00:33:07,277 --> 00:33:08,819
I was thinking, maybe they can...

620
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,738
...triangulate these things, man,
or, like, trace them.

621
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,824
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

622
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,827
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right, man.

623
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:17,662
Maybe they can even trace them...

624
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:20,290
...like, when We're not even
on them, you know?

625
00:33:20,458 --> 00:33:23,959
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

626
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:26,086
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

627
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,713
We'll never catch an animal.

628
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:30,340
The squirrel'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

629
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:32,134
No, no, no.

630
00:33:32,302 --> 00:33:34,679
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

631
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:36,221
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

632
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,806
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

633
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:40,893
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

634
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,270
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

635
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,108
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

636
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,486
- What tree?
- That one.

637
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,197
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

638
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:56,201
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

639
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,327
Did you at least see
where it landed?

640
00:33:58,495 --> 00:34:00,120
I don't know. Call it.

641
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:03,999
Call it? With What?
My phone has been smashed.

642
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,794
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

643
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,423
Well, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

644
00:34:11,591 --> 00:34:14,219
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

645
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:16,513
- Do you see it?
- See What?

646
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,932
The phone, you idiot.

647
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,893
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

648
00:34:22,061 --> 00:34:24,353
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

649
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:27,272
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

650
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,441
- What?
- What was that?

651
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,691
- What?
- What is that?

652
00:34:30,859 --> 00:34:33,737
- What?
- I hear something.

653
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:34,947
What?

654
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,990
I don't know. Do you hear that?

655
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:39,535
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

656
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:41,453
Oh, fuck!

657
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:44,998
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

658
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:48,585
Help me!

659
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,088
Tell him to get away from me!

660
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:53,424
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

661
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:55,426
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

662
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:59,264
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

663
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,182
- Fall back!
- Save me!

664
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,362
Oh, shit.

665
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,407
Car.

666
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,750
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

667
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,169
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

668
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,631
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

669
00:35:33,799 --> 00:35:37,468
- Go! I saw something!
- Go! What did you see? Shut up!

670
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:41,138
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

671
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,599
I heard something,
then I saw something.

672
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,475
You didn't hear anything, man.

673
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,477
Well, I saw something.

674
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:54,652
And you're telling me that guy
in the little short shorts...

675
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,195
...broke your nose?
- Right.

676
00:35:56,363 --> 00:36:00,282
The BeDazzler guy
broke your nose, tough man?

677
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,299
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

678
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,260
How did I get on you?

679
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,679
I wonder.

680
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,560
Watch finally broke.

681
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,355
Crazy. What time is it?

682
00:36:34,193 --> 00:36:35,485
That can't be right.

683
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:38,821
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

684
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,074
It's 3:00 right now?

685
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,784
Holy shit, man!

686
00:36:42,951 --> 00:36:46,453
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

687
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,079
No, it's daylight-savings, so...

688
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:51,249
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

689
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:55,712
It's 4 o,-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

690
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,049
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

691
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,760
My bubbe...
Man, my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.

692
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,011
Shit.

693
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:05,013
We gotta call Red.

694
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:07,766
Okay. Now?

695
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,977
We'll go to a pay phone.

696
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:13,398
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

697
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,566
Great. Well, do you remember
where he lives?

698
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:17,068
Yeah, I know where he lives.

699
00:37:17,236 --> 00:37:19,361
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

700
00:37:19,529 --> 00:37:20,946
"Insinuating." Good word.

701
00:37:21,114 --> 00:37:22,406
Do you know what that means?

702
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,575
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like, "to seem like."

703
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:30,540
Let's roll. I'm done With the woods.
Let's go.

704
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,709
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

705
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:36,753
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

706
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,588
Wait.

707
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:40,882
What do you mean, it's dead?

708
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,594
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

709
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,430
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

710
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,100
How can I explain this
to you differently?

711
00:37:49,268 --> 00:37:52,269
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

712
00:37:52,437 --> 00:37:55,939
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

713
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,859
How did this happen?

714
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,778
Well, we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on, and...

715
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:03,905
Oh, man. To talk radio?

716
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,450
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring, man.

717
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,412
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

718
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,706
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

719
00:38:11,874 --> 00:38:13,124
We're gonna go.

720
00:38:13,292 --> 00:38:16,002
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

721
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:18,129
Someone will pick us up,
take us to Red's.

722
00:38:18,297 --> 00:38:21,507
Red Will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

723
00:38:21,675 --> 00:38:22,966
How does that sound? Good?

724
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,968
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

725
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,721
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

726
00:38:27,889 --> 00:38:29,931
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

727
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,776
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

728
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:43,320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

729
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:45,405
Thanks for taking care of it.

730
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,449
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

731
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,120
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

732
00:39:41,337 --> 00:39:43,129
Here's good.

733
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,721
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

734
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,473
You're welcome.

735
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,980
- You're sure We can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

736
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:01,773
Who is it?

737
00:40:01,941 --> 00:40:05,611
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

738
00:40:05,779 --> 00:40:08,947
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

739
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,156
Who's this?

740
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:12,284
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

741
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,493
Dale who?

742
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,620
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

743
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:17,080
Dale Denton. He's with me.

744
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,583
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

745
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,460
- Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay?
- You better.

746
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,922
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

747
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,800
- Y,all Wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

748
00:40:27,968 --> 00:40:30,052
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

749
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,138
Look at that, huh?

750
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:35,558
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

751
00:40:35,726 --> 00:40:40,353
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

752
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,938
What's up with the clothes?

753
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,984
We were camping.

754
00:40:45,152 --> 00:40:46,611
- Camping?
- Yeah.

755
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:49,863
Is your lip okay, man?

756
00:40:50,031 --> 00:40:52,073
- You been crying?
- Oh, my lip.

757
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,200
It's a cold sore.

758
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,787
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

759
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,166
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

760
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,920
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

761
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,589
Yeah. Yes, it does.

762
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,592
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

763
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,470
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

764
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:14,137
Herpes is for life, bro.

765
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,807
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

766
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,602
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

767
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:22,479
It's from that time. I told you, man.

768
00:41:22,647 --> 00:41:26,025
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

769
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:28,861
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

770
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,323
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

771
00:41:32,491 --> 00:41:35,951
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

772
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,787
Dudes, seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

773
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:43,167
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

774
00:41:43,335 --> 00:41:45,086
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

775
00:41:45,253 --> 00:41:46,504
Can I have a piece of thatu

776
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,964
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

777
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:50,632
No, you can't. This is private.

778
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,550
Do you know what today is?

779
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:55,679
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

780
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:59,015
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

781
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,142
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

782
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,645
So now who's the funny guy?

783
00:42:02,938 --> 00:42:03,980
Sorry.

784
00:42:04,147 --> 00:42:05,231
Today is his birthday...

785
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:08,734
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

786
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:12,196
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

787
00:42:12,614 --> 00:42:14,699
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

788
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:16,534
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

789
00:42:16,702 --> 00:42:18,828
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

790
00:42:18,996 --> 00:42:20,204
What are we talk...? Guys...

791
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,872
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

792
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,165
Ask What? Just come straight.
What's up?

793
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,334
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

794
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,461
We need to know...

795
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,380
We need to know
about your source.

796
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,881
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

797
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,719
See, Dale, here,
is a protest servant.

798
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,345
I'm not. That's not what I am.

799
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:40,640
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

800
00:42:40,809 --> 00:42:45,813
Don't... Look, we don't want
to bring you in to What we're in, okay?

801
00:42:45,981 --> 00:42:48,733
You don't Want any trouble.
We don't Wanna give you trouble.

802
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:51,318
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

803
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:54,362
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

804
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,406
- You can.
- I totally can.

805
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,366
And for you
to come into my house...

806
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,746
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

807
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:04,623
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

808
00:43:04,791 --> 00:43:06,042
Look at this. See this?

809
00:43:06,752 --> 00:43:09,003
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

810
00:43:09,171 --> 00:43:10,628
What's the significance of that?

811
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:13,590
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

812
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:17,469
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

813
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,097
That's all we need to know.

814
00:43:23,226 --> 00:43:24,769
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

815
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:26,937
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

816
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:30,023
Cleared. Over.

817
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:32,150
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

818
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:33,985
We had a Wacky night
in the woods...

819
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:36,780
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

820
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,074
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

821
00:43:39,242 --> 00:43:40,701
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

822
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,203
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

823
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,080
Yes.

824
00:43:44,498 --> 00:43:45,790
There you go.

825
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:47,958
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

826
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:50,252
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

827
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:52,963
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

828
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,381
You're more chill than me?

829
00:43:54,549 --> 00:43:57,093
Look at what I'm Wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

830
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,136
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

831
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:02,514
I don't knowwhat's up with you,
but I don't knowif I like you.

832
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,808
Well, I don't know
if I like you either, man.

833
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,310
Well, that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

834
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,230
I'm gonna use the telefono
to call my wife, okay?

835
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,564
- Give her a call.
- I will.

836
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,359
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

837
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:13,444
- Go ahead.
- Sit on my couch...

838
00:44:13,611 --> 00:44:15,696
...my chillastic couch, and chill out.

839
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:18,575
- I'm chilling right here.
- Don't listen to what I'm saying.

840
00:44:18,742 --> 00:44:21,077
- This is private. This is my wife.
- I'm listening.

841
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:23,455
I'm not trying to be enemies.
I don't wanna be.

842
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:25,290
- I wanna be friends.
- Well, then good.

843
00:44:25,458 --> 00:44:27,083
- I wanna be best friends.
- Come here.

844
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:29,502
- Shake my fucking hand.
- Shake my hand. Okay.

845
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,629
- See, we can be friends.
- I'm feeling it.

846
00:44:31,797 --> 00:44:35,007
- You feel that? We can be best friends.
- I'm looking through you, man.

847
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:36,592
I'm looking through you too...

848
00:44:36,759 --> 00:44:39,554
...and I see I need to paint
the spot on the wall behind you.

849
00:44:39,722 --> 00:44:41,473
- I'm looking through you.
- Transparent.

850
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:45,310
- I see your intentions.
- I see your intestines and intentions.

851
00:44:45,603 --> 00:44:48,645
- What'd I have for dinner last night?
- Cake.

852
00:44:48,938 --> 00:44:50,939
I'll be right back.
Make this phone call.

853
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:54,443
Bullshit.

854
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:56,986
No, no, no.

855
00:44:57,154 --> 00:44:58,655
- Liar.
- What are you doing, man?

856
00:44:58,823 --> 00:45:01,283
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man.
He's lying to us.

857
00:45:01,451 --> 00:45:02,451
No, he's not.

858
00:45:02,618 --> 00:45:04,494
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

859
00:45:04,662 --> 00:45:06,621
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

860
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:09,248
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

861
00:45:09,416 --> 00:45:10,666
I do not trust you, sir.

862
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,585
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

863
00:45:12,753 --> 00:45:14,754
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

864
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:16,505
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

865
00:45:16,673 --> 00:45:17,841
Fuck you!

866
00:45:18,009 --> 00:45:19,676
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

867
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,136
Oh, Jesus.

868
00:45:23,514 --> 00:45:25,223
Herpes!

869
00:45:25,558 --> 00:45:27,517
I don't wanna have to do this.

870
00:45:27,685 --> 00:45:28,852
Red, you're crazy, man.

871
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:31,021
You brought the devil
into my house.

872
00:45:31,189 --> 00:45:32,898
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

873
00:45:33,065 --> 00:45:35,149
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

874
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:39,321
Dale, he's hurting me!

875
00:45:39,489 --> 00:45:41,031
Toilet.

876
00:45:41,199 --> 00:45:42,698
Flush.

877
00:45:42,866 --> 00:45:46,076
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

878
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,579
True!

879
00:46:00,968 --> 00:46:04,721
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

880
00:46:05,348 --> 00:46:07,224
Stay out of here!

881
00:46:10,061 --> 00:46:12,479
Red, don't do it!

882
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:16,233
- Red!
- You assholes.

883
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,984
You ruined my portable phone.

884
00:46:18,152 --> 00:46:20,362
- TeamWork.
- Yes.

885
00:46:21,656 --> 00:46:23,739
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

886
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,078
Fuck.

887
00:46:29,246 --> 00:46:30,621
Phone.

888
00:46:32,958 --> 00:46:35,168
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

889
00:46:35,336 --> 00:46:37,879
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

890
00:46:38,047 --> 00:46:39,548
Tell us everything, now!

891
00:46:39,715 --> 00:46:41,049
Said they were gonna kill me.

892
00:46:41,217 --> 00:46:43,218
What did you tell Ted?

893
00:46:43,386 --> 00:46:45,303
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

894
00:46:45,471 --> 00:46:46,930
Smash them.

895
00:46:47,098 --> 00:46:48,139
Fuck!

896
00:46:48,307 --> 00:46:51,100
Time out. Time out.

897
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:53,018
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

898
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:54,980
- Stop!
- Cheater!

899
00:46:55,147 --> 00:46:56,940
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

900
00:46:57,108 --> 00:46:59,526
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

901
00:47:00,778 --> 00:47:01,778
Fuck.

902
00:47:03,281 --> 00:47:04,781
God...

903
00:47:04,949 --> 00:47:06,241
Fuck!

904
00:47:06,409 --> 00:47:08,410
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

905
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:12,329
Fuck!

906
00:47:15,793 --> 00:47:17,168
No! No, no, no!

907
00:47:17,336 --> 00:47:19,212
Where you going, huh?

908
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,464
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Wiggles?

909
00:47:21,632 --> 00:47:24,383
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

910
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:25,968
He's punching my bum!

911
00:47:26,136 --> 00:47:28,888
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

912
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:32,725
Use words! No! No! No!

913
00:47:35,938 --> 00:47:37,314
You okay, man?

914
00:47:37,481 --> 00:47:39,983
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

915
00:47:41,319 --> 00:47:43,028
Happy birthday.

916
00:47:43,529 --> 00:47:44,571
- All right?
- Thank you.

917
00:47:44,739 --> 00:47:47,032
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

918
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,284
This ends now!

919
00:47:53,332 --> 00:47:54,790
Oh, shit.

920
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,750
Was that too much?

921
00:47:58,627 --> 00:48:00,586
Can't get the edge.

922
00:48:01,129 --> 00:48:03,005
Wait. Got it. Got it.

923
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:04,340
Hey, Dale.

924
00:48:04,507 --> 00:48:07,843
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

925
00:48:08,011 --> 00:48:09,219
I don't think I am either.

926
00:48:09,387 --> 00:48:12,181
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

927
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,768
Or, just not say anything.

928
00:48:15,895 --> 00:48:19,147
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

929
00:48:19,982 --> 00:48:21,566
Wake up.

930
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:23,234
Hey, what's up, dudes?

931
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:26,488
What's up? Tell us everything now.

932
00:48:26,656 --> 00:48:27,697
Talk, Red.

933
00:48:27,865 --> 00:48:30,199
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

934
00:48:34,413 --> 00:48:35,622
Trapped.

935
00:48:35,790 --> 00:48:37,040
Not happening, Red.

936
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,709
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

937
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:44,381
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

938
00:48:44,548 --> 00:48:47,549
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

939
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:50,052
Two real big son of a bitches.

940
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:51,972
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

941
00:48:52,139 --> 00:48:54,766
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y,all over.

942
00:48:54,934 --> 00:48:56,768
So you guys are basically fucked.

943
00:48:56,936 --> 00:48:59,562
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

944
00:48:59,730 --> 00:49:02,524
- Well, there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

945
00:49:02,692 --> 00:49:05,943
I don't know. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

946
00:49:06,111 --> 00:49:09,071
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

947
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:10,824
- Oh, shit.
- What else?

948
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:13,201
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

949
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:14,828
They're in a drug war right now.

950
00:49:14,996 --> 00:49:17,330
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

951
00:49:17,498 --> 00:49:19,082
- It's true.
- What Asians?

952
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:23,086
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

953
00:49:23,254 --> 00:49:24,254
Vietcong?

954
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:27,090
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

955
00:49:27,258 --> 00:49:32,888
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

956
00:49:33,056 --> 00:49:34,097
- Ding-dong.
- Hey, Red!

957
00:49:34,265 --> 00:49:35,598
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, they're here.

958
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,099
They're here to kill me.

959
00:49:37,267 --> 00:49:41,145
Okay, I know I sold y,all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

960
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:43,731
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a newfriend.

961
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:46,108
I can make it up.
I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

962
00:49:46,276 --> 00:49:48,736
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

963
00:49:48,903 --> 00:49:50,280
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

964
00:49:50,448 --> 00:49:52,198
No sweat.

965
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:58,580
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

966
00:49:58,748 --> 00:50:01,916
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

967
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:06,171
Hey. In here.

968
00:50:06,338 --> 00:50:08,339
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

969
00:50:08,507 --> 00:50:10,133
- We should hide.
- Why?

970
00:50:10,301 --> 00:50:12,218
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

971
00:50:12,386 --> 00:50:14,137
...then they'll go to my apartment.

972
00:50:14,305 --> 00:50:18,016
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

973
00:50:18,184 --> 00:50:19,684
No. I think we should stay.

974
00:50:19,852 --> 00:50:22,186
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

975
00:50:22,353 --> 00:50:25,439
Well, then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

976
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,903
- They're gone.
- Well, find out what he knows.

977
00:50:30,071 --> 00:50:31,571
Red, it's your last chance, man.

978
00:50:31,739 --> 00:50:33,531
You gonna give us something
we can use?

979
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:37,118
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, What more do you want?

980
00:50:37,286 --> 00:50:39,370
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

981
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:41,164
He's obviously working with Saul.

982
00:50:41,332 --> 00:50:43,333
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

983
00:50:43,501 --> 00:50:45,167
They kicked the hell out of me...

984
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:47,503
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

985
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:50,173
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

986
00:50:50,341 --> 00:50:54,010
- You hear that, Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

987
00:50:54,178 --> 00:50:56,679
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

988
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:58,932
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

989
00:50:59,100 --> 00:51:01,267
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

990
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:03,812
Obviously. We're friends.

991
00:51:03,979 --> 00:51:05,271
Ted, you hear him?

992
00:51:05,439 --> 00:51:09,360
Dale Denton: Not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

993
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:13,029
Listen, I would appreciate it
if both y,all would take your shoes off.

994
00:51:13,197 --> 00:51:15,698
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

995
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,533
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

996
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,701
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

997
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:23,163
What the hell are you doing?

998
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,040
Ted told me to kill him.

999
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,044
Well, how about
a little fucking discretion here?

1000
00:51:28,212 --> 00:51:30,088
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

1001
00:51:30,256 --> 00:51:31,381
- You catch it?
- See What?

1002
00:51:31,549 --> 00:51:34,634
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

1003
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:37,846
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

1004
00:51:38,681 --> 00:51:40,098
You was ruthless.

1005
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:42,642
You was ruthless, man.

1006
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:45,895
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

1007
00:51:46,564 --> 00:51:48,274
I'm gonna die now probably.

1008
00:51:48,441 --> 00:51:51,860
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

1009
00:51:52,027 --> 00:51:53,570
This how you do me?

1010
00:51:57,116 --> 00:51:58,949
So, What did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

1011
00:51:59,117 --> 00:52:00,742
I don't know.

1012
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:04,163
There's this guy, Saul...

1013
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:07,667
...something, selling weed who Works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

1014
00:52:07,835 --> 00:52:09,210
That's all he got out of him.

1015
00:52:09,378 --> 00:52:12,797
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that We shot?

1016
00:52:12,965 --> 00:52:14,841
Well, did he say anything else?

1017
00:52:15,009 --> 00:52:18,261
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

1018
00:52:18,429 --> 00:52:20,597
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

1019
00:52:20,764 --> 00:52:22,849
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

1020
00:52:23,017 --> 00:52:26,436
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

1021
00:52:26,937 --> 00:52:30,356
Maybe affer we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

1022
00:52:30,524 --> 00:52:32,692
What's his name? Denton?
- To finish the job.

1023
00:52:33,152 --> 00:52:34,194
Maybe.

1024
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:37,488
Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.

1025
00:52:37,656 --> 00:52:41,159
I'll have everything there is to know
about this Dale Denton guy.

1026
00:52:41,327 --> 00:52:44,746
Who he's screwing,
who's his mother, everything.

1027
00:52:44,955 --> 00:52:46,539
I have to take a shit.

1028
00:52:48,709 --> 00:52:50,543
Wait. Where are We going?

1029
00:52:50,711 --> 00:52:55,006
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

1030
00:52:55,174 --> 00:52:57,634
What about my bubbe?
Don't think they'll go after her.

1031
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,385
I mean, she has
a difterent last name.

1032
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:01,887
Belogus.

1033
00:53:02,055 --> 00:53:05,391
I don't know. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

1034
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,368
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

1035
00:53:23,535 --> 00:53:27,289
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

1036
00:53:27,457 --> 00:53:30,334
And you can call it rude.
You can call it Whatever you want.

1037
00:53:30,502 --> 00:53:33,919
You can be polite with your clean
plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

1038
00:53:34,087 --> 00:53:35,128
Dad, he'll be here.

1039
00:53:35,296 --> 00:53:38,340
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

1040
00:53:38,508 --> 00:53:41,510
Honey, we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

1041
00:53:44,556 --> 00:53:47,058
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

1042
00:53:47,226 --> 00:53:48,851
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

1043
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:51,062
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1044
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:54,107
- I wanna meet Angie.
- You'll meet her later, man. Look.

1045
00:53:54,275 --> 00:53:56,859
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

1046
00:53:57,027 --> 00:53:58,778
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

1047
00:53:58,946 --> 00:54:01,072
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

1048
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,949
I'll keep guard.

1049
00:54:03,451 --> 00:54:05,034
Hey.

1050
00:54:06,453 --> 00:54:08,037
Shit.

1051
00:54:08,205 --> 00:54:09,747
Oh, no.

1052
00:54:09,915 --> 00:54:10,957
Hey, Dale.

1053
00:54:11,125 --> 00:54:14,043
- Hello, Dale.
- Hey.

1054
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:15,253
Dinner.

1055
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:20,341
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

1056
00:54:20,509 --> 00:54:21,800
Sit. Please.

1057
00:54:21,968 --> 00:54:24,262
Of course. Hi.

1058
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:26,055
- Hi.
- Shannon.

1059
00:54:26,223 --> 00:54:27,849
- Intros.
- Great to meet you.

1060
00:54:28,017 --> 00:54:30,727
- Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
- Sit down, so We can eat.

1061
00:54:30,894 --> 00:54:33,354
- Hi, Dale.
- Hi. Okay.

1062
00:54:33,522 --> 00:54:35,023
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

1063
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:37,066
I'm supposed to be here right now.

1064
00:54:37,234 --> 00:54:38,359
So I'm here.

1065
00:54:38,526 --> 00:54:41,695
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

1066
00:54:41,863 --> 00:54:45,700
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude, you smell like shit.

1067
00:54:45,868 --> 00:54:48,536
- Dale, what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

1068
00:54:48,704 --> 00:54:51,873
- In the Woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

1069
00:54:52,041 --> 00:54:53,916
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

1070
00:54:54,084 --> 00:54:56,419
I bird-watch. I don't.

1071
00:54:56,587 --> 00:54:59,505
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

1072
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:03,344
I witnessed a murder, okay?

1073
00:55:03,511 --> 00:55:05,429
I sawsomeone
murder someone else...

1074
00:55:05,597 --> 00:55:08,098
...and I think
they've been following me.

1075
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:10,558
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

1076
00:55:10,726 --> 00:55:12,434
...where Angie has a lot of things.

1077
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:15,562
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her cell number is written...

1078
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:17,022
...and it's on my fridge.

1079
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,816
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

1080
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,694
We should call the police
right away.

1081
00:55:21,862 --> 00:55:23,946
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

1082
00:55:24,114 --> 00:55:26,657
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

1083
00:55:26,825 --> 00:55:29,494
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna...

1084
00:55:29,661 --> 00:55:31,746
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

1085
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:35,458
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

1086
00:55:35,626 --> 00:55:38,252
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

1087
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:40,923
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

1088
00:55:41,091 --> 00:55:42,925
You are high as a fucking kite.

1089
00:55:43,093 --> 00:55:44,551
I'm not high. Let's go.

1090
00:55:44,719 --> 00:55:46,803
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

1091
00:55:46,970 --> 00:55:49,222
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

1092
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:51,641
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

1093
00:55:51,809 --> 00:55:53,810
Your gun? His gun?

1094
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:56,437
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

1095
00:55:56,605 --> 00:56:00,608
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

1096
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:18,625
I just want you to know,
I always got your back.

1097
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:23,505
And I'm glad we're partners.

1098
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,722
- This is so exciting.
- Okay, okay.

1099
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,016
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

1100
00:56:34,184 --> 00:56:35,601
Who is after you, after Angie?

1101
00:56:35,769 --> 00:56:39,188
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

1102
00:56:39,356 --> 00:56:41,816
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

1103
00:56:41,984 --> 00:56:44,402
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

1104
00:56:44,570 --> 00:56:47,988
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

1105
00:56:48,198 --> 00:56:49,448
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

1106
00:56:49,616 --> 00:56:51,366
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

1107
00:56:51,534 --> 00:56:54,786
- Angie, What did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

1108
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,080
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

1109
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:58,372
- I got it.
- Get it.

1110
00:57:00,877 --> 00:57:03,295
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale, who is this?

1111
00:57:03,463 --> 00:57:06,465
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

1112
00:57:11,179 --> 00:57:12,429
What was that?

1113
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:14,681
That was a gunshot.

1114
00:57:18,687 --> 00:57:20,563
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

1115
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:22,690
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

1116
00:57:22,858 --> 00:57:25,235
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

1117
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:27,152
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

1118
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:30,114
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

1119
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,032
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

1120
00:57:38,248 --> 00:57:40,749
- Where's your gun?
- I don't need it.

1121
00:57:40,917 --> 00:57:43,627
Kill motherfuckers With my hands.

1122
00:57:45,004 --> 00:57:48,173
Get out your goddamn gun.
You're making me uncomfortable.

1123
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:00,769
Anybody out there?

1124
00:58:03,773 --> 00:58:06,233
Fucking hide-and-seek.

1125
00:58:06,401 --> 00:58:08,026
Say, now.

1126
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,906
Hey, the food's still warm.

1127
00:58:15,952 --> 00:58:17,162
Love it.

1128
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:19,581
I found a bloody fork.

1129
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:23,375
It's fucking freaky, man.
They could still be here.

1130
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,794
Did you check the rest of the house?

1131
00:58:26,838 --> 00:58:29,173
I'm about to check that bathroom,
I know that much.

1132
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:31,633
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

1133
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:34,302
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe, guys. We made it.

1134
00:58:34,469 --> 00:58:35,803
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

1135
00:58:35,971 --> 00:58:38,682
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

1136
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,976
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

1137
00:58:41,144 --> 00:58:43,270
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

1138
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:46,857
- Stay away from my family. Period.
- So where do we go? What do we do?

1139
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:49,359
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

1140
00:58:49,527 --> 00:58:51,653
Use a fake name.

1141
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:54,156
Garagely. I'll contact you.

1142
00:58:54,324 --> 00:58:57,327
I don't knowwho these people are,
what they're capable of...

1143
00:58:57,494 --> 00:59:00,163
...but I Will keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

1144
00:59:00,331 --> 00:59:01,664
Fuck off, loser.

1145
00:59:03,626 --> 00:59:07,211
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that With love.

1146
00:59:09,172 --> 00:59:11,547
Okay, you call this Mocha Milkshake.

1147
00:59:11,715 --> 00:59:15,176
This one here, English Breeze.
Charge $40 for these.

1148
00:59:15,345 --> 00:59:17,012
- Forty?
- Yeah.

1149
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:22,643
This one, Da Vinci's Brush.
Call this one Bumble Bush.

1150
00:59:22,810 --> 00:59:26,772
And this here, Spanish Trampoline.

1151
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:29,191
Crazy With them names, ain't you, T?

1152
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:31,568
What the fuck is...?
What is it, Spanish...?

1153
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:34,279
Spanish Trampoline.
Used to call it Spanish Mudflaps...

1154
00:59:34,447 --> 00:59:36,908
...but Troy likes to trampoline
so Spanish Trampoline.

1155
00:59:37,076 --> 00:59:39,285
- Almost the same number of syllables.
- How much?

1156
00:59:39,453 --> 00:59:41,536
- Forty-five for these last three.
- All right.

1157
00:59:41,704 --> 00:59:44,414
- And leave me the best stash.
- All right.

1158
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:46,625
It's Pineapple Express.
Get your ass up.

1159
00:59:46,793 --> 00:59:49,336
Yup, of course.

1160
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:54,384
So get this:

1161
00:59:54,551 --> 00:59:56,135
We triangulated the cells.

1162
00:59:56,303 --> 00:59:59,888
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

1163
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:02,057
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

1164
01:00:02,225 --> 01:00:04,935
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

1165
01:00:05,103 --> 01:00:07,479
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

1166
01:00:07,647 --> 01:00:10,899
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, leotards.

1167
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:12,943
I mean, What the fuck
does that mean?

1168
01:00:13,111 --> 01:00:15,612
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

1169
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:18,073
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

1170
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:30,711
Hello?

1171
01:00:30,878 --> 01:00:31,920
Cheung, it's Ted.

1172
01:00:32,088 --> 01:00:33,381
Record this conversation.

1173
01:00:34,008 --> 01:00:37,760
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

1174
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:41,931
Well, Cheung, my friend,
let me tell you.

1175
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:46,018
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

1176
01:00:46,185 --> 01:00:50,187
...hit men over here last night,
and I and my colleague...

1177
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:53,525
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

1178
01:00:53,693 --> 01:00:57,070
We painted the wall with his brain.
Painted it.

1179
01:00:57,238 --> 01:01:00,907
And nowthis Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

1180
01:01:01,075 --> 01:01:04,661
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

1181
01:01:04,829 --> 01:01:06,079
- What?
- What?

1182
01:01:06,247 --> 01:01:07,664
- Hello?
- Troy?

1183
01:01:07,832 --> 01:01:12,420
Dad! Get off the phone. I told you
I'm gonna call some hot bitches later...

1184
01:01:12,588 --> 01:01:15,089
...and this is the time.
- I got you your own line...

1185
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:17,508
...so you would stay off mine.
Get off the phone.

1186
01:01:17,676 --> 01:01:21,136
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a little kid, I'm a man!

1187
01:01:21,304 --> 01:01:24,723
And from this point forward, I'm
not taking any of your fucking shit.

1188
01:01:24,891 --> 01:01:29,186
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic
in our relationship is about to change.

1189
01:01:29,354 --> 01:01:31,605
Troy, do me a favor,
get oft the fucking phone!

1190
01:01:32,191 --> 01:01:35,317
- Shit.
- So you have a son.

1191
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:37,486
Sounds like a very nice boy.

1192
01:01:37,653 --> 01:01:40,447
All right, you listen to me, Cheung,
you motherfucker!

1193
01:01:40,615 --> 01:01:43,075
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

1194
01:01:43,242 --> 01:01:45,786
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

1195
01:01:45,953 --> 01:01:47,621
...and be ready for everything!

1196
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:49,664
You are fucking dead!

1197
01:01:50,792 --> 01:01:51,918
You are so dumb.

1198
01:01:52,086 --> 01:01:55,587
Do you have any idea
how Weak you just made us look?

1199
01:01:57,048 --> 01:02:00,133
Goddamn it!

1200
01:02:00,468 --> 01:02:01,802
Totally sweet.

1201
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,513
Ted Jones is slipping.

1202
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:08,308
We shall strike now with full force.

1203
01:02:09,477 --> 01:02:12,230
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

1204
01:02:14,775 --> 01:02:18,403
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

1205
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:21,154
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

1206
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:23,824
- Really? Thanks, man.
- No problem.

1207
01:02:23,991 --> 01:02:26,451
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

1208
01:02:26,619 --> 01:02:30,414
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

1209
01:02:30,581 --> 01:02:34,501
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

1210
01:02:34,669 --> 01:02:37,671
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

1211
01:02:38,881 --> 01:02:40,382
Yeah.

1212
01:02:43,010 --> 01:02:45,679
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

1213
01:02:45,847 --> 01:02:47,514
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

1214
01:02:48,391 --> 01:02:49,683
Get bus tickets.

1215
01:02:49,851 --> 01:02:53,312
Go to the next town.
Contact some police.

1216
01:02:53,480 --> 01:02:55,731
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

1217
01:02:55,899 --> 01:02:57,859
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

1218
01:02:58,026 --> 01:03:00,194
But We should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

1219
01:03:00,362 --> 01:03:01,571
What?

1220
01:03:01,737 --> 01:03:04,865
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

1221
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:08,368
I only have, like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

1222
01:03:08,952 --> 01:03:10,245
What about your sack?

1223
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:13,290
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

1224
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,419
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

1225
01:03:17,587 --> 01:03:19,045
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

1226
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,298
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

1227
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:23,133
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

1228
01:03:23,301 --> 01:03:27,345
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

1229
01:03:27,513 --> 01:03:30,308
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

1230
01:03:30,476 --> 01:03:32,059
These guys are amazing.

1231
01:03:32,561 --> 01:03:33,936
What the fuck do you want?

1232
01:03:34,104 --> 01:03:36,271
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

1233
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,571
What's this stuff called again?

1234
01:03:44,739 --> 01:03:46,740
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

1235
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:50,119
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

1236
01:03:50,287 --> 01:03:53,164
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at Weed too.

1237
01:03:53,332 --> 01:03:56,250
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

1238
01:03:56,418 --> 01:03:58,919
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

1239
01:03:59,086 --> 01:04:03,131
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

1240
01:04:03,299 --> 01:04:04,716
Who the fuck's Chachi?

1241
01:04:22,610 --> 01:04:24,694
- How much money you guys gotu
- Come on.

1242
01:04:24,862 --> 01:04:27,239
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

1243
01:04:27,407 --> 01:04:29,700
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

1244
01:04:29,868 --> 01:04:33,538
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

1245
01:04:33,705 --> 01:04:37,875
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

1246
01:04:38,043 --> 01:04:40,878
- Go. Come on.
- Go, go. Vamoose!

1247
01:04:42,964 --> 01:04:44,047
You fucking did it, man.

1248
01:04:44,215 --> 01:04:46,882
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

1249
01:04:47,051 --> 01:04:49,469
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

1250
01:04:49,637 --> 01:04:51,137
Get some burritos or something.

1251
01:04:51,305 --> 01:04:53,306
Something to drink too.
Something good.

1252
01:04:53,474 --> 01:04:55,892
See you, man. Nice.

1253
01:05:02,108 --> 01:05:05,485
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

1254
01:05:05,653 --> 01:05:07,280
Don't move. What's in your hand?

1255
01:05:07,447 --> 01:05:09,198
It's Weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

1256
01:05:09,366 --> 01:05:11,075
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

1257
01:05:11,243 --> 01:05:13,786
I thought it was decriminalized,
to be honest with you.

1258
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:18,206
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

1259
01:05:18,374 --> 01:05:23,169
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

1260
01:05:23,337 --> 01:05:26,340
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

1261
01:05:26,508 --> 01:05:29,594
And guess what? I just saw three
students Walking from back here...

1262
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:33,096
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

1263
01:05:39,312 --> 01:05:41,187
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

1264
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:43,064
I'm on the hood. Come on.

1265
01:05:43,232 --> 01:05:46,027
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

1266
01:05:46,194 --> 01:05:49,904
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

1267
01:05:50,072 --> 01:05:52,907
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

1268
01:05:56,579 --> 01:05:59,039
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

1269
01:06:01,334 --> 01:06:04,836
This is Ofticer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

1270
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:09,550
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

1271
01:06:09,718 --> 01:06:11,719
425, 425, what's your location?

1272
01:06:13,263 --> 01:06:14,555
You going down.

1273
01:06:14,723 --> 01:06:16,807
What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

1274
01:06:16,975 --> 01:06:19,226
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

1275
01:06:19,394 --> 01:06:21,645
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

1276
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,313
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

1277
01:06:24,482 --> 01:06:26,900
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

1278
01:06:27,068 --> 01:06:28,568
Two parked cars, tWo nights ago.

1279
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:30,779
One of them Was actually
a police cruiser.

1280
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:33,823
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

1281
01:06:33,991 --> 01:06:36,868
It's the lady cop.
They got Dale. Oh, shit.

1282
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,912
So you're telling me
you saw Ted Jones...

1283
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,872
...and a police officer
shoot somebody?

1284
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,540
- Exactly.
- And you sawit?

1285
01:06:42,708 --> 01:06:44,710
- Yes, do you believe me?
- Give me a minute.

1286
01:06:44,878 --> 01:06:47,713
- It was a Woman or a man?
- It was a policewoman. A woman.

1287
01:06:47,881 --> 01:06:52,760
- I think I know who that bitch Was.
- Yes. I will identify that bitch.

1288
01:06:54,721 --> 01:06:57,138
Thank you so much for believing me,
ma,am. Thank you.

1289
01:06:57,306 --> 01:06:59,391
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

1290
01:06:59,558 --> 01:07:01,810
I'll take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

1291
01:07:01,977 --> 01:07:04,146
I don't work for the law.
The law Works for me.

1292
01:07:04,314 --> 01:07:06,440
I been smelling something
in this department.

1293
01:07:06,608 --> 01:07:07,942
Keep your eyes on the road.

1294
01:07:08,110 --> 01:07:10,360
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
- Stop!

1295
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:12,946
Son of a bitch!

1296
01:07:13,114 --> 01:07:16,950
Oh, no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

1297
01:07:22,958 --> 01:07:26,711
No, no, no.

1298
01:07:26,878 --> 01:07:29,880
- No. What are you doing?
- I'm saving you, amigo!

1299
01:07:31,257 --> 01:07:33,299
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

1300
01:07:33,467 --> 01:07:36,052
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

1301
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:38,012
Stop this car!

1302
01:07:41,642 --> 01:07:44,145
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

1303
01:07:44,312 --> 01:07:45,730
Oh, shit!

1304
01:07:48,316 --> 01:07:51,318
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

1305
01:07:51,486 --> 01:07:53,070
- That's the lady cop.
- Who's that?

1306
01:07:53,238 --> 01:07:56,282
I don't know. They're shooting!

1307
01:08:02,205 --> 01:08:04,164
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

1308
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:05,665
Fuck.

1309
01:08:10,629 --> 01:08:12,172
Dude!

1310
01:08:14,925 --> 01:08:16,509
I can't see! The Slushee!

1311
01:08:16,677 --> 01:08:18,845
- Turn on the Wipers!
- It's not working!

1312
01:08:19,013 --> 01:08:20,680
Well, kick out the window!

1313
01:08:20,848 --> 01:08:23,601
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

1314
01:08:25,604 --> 01:08:27,480
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

1315
01:08:30,859 --> 01:08:32,193
Get your foot out of there.

1316
01:08:32,903 --> 01:08:35,029
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

1317
01:08:35,197 --> 01:08:36,238
Her car's better.

1318
01:08:36,406 --> 01:08:38,823
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

1319
01:08:38,991 --> 01:08:41,869
Put it into maximum overdrive!

1320
01:08:44,372 --> 01:08:46,456
Oh, no, no, no!

1321
01:08:48,501 --> 01:08:49,793
Oh, shit!

1322
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:51,669
Get it out!

1323
01:08:54,089 --> 01:08:55,715
I can't see!

1324
01:09:01,056 --> 01:09:05,476
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

1325
01:09:08,396 --> 01:09:09,980
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

1326
01:09:10,148 --> 01:09:11,898
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

1327
01:09:14,610 --> 01:09:16,528
You did it, man.

1328
01:09:17,822 --> 01:09:19,322
All right! Look out!

1329
01:09:19,490 --> 01:09:21,575
Oh, shit!

1330
01:09:21,743 --> 01:09:24,161
Turn around! Turn around!

1331
01:09:32,419 --> 01:09:34,254
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

1332
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:36,756
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

1333
01:09:36,924 --> 01:09:39,175
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

1334
01:09:42,681 --> 01:09:46,015
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1335
01:09:46,934 --> 01:09:48,434
Sorry!

1336
01:09:49,728 --> 01:09:51,312
What the fuck was that?

1337
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:53,731
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

1338
01:09:53,899 --> 01:09:55,775
- Why?
- I don't know.

1339
01:10:12,794 --> 01:10:14,295
Oh, my.

1340
01:10:18,759 --> 01:10:21,176
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

1341
01:10:21,344 --> 01:10:24,012
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

1342
01:10:24,180 --> 01:10:26,973
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

1343
01:10:27,141 --> 01:10:30,018
Come back! Saul!

1344
01:10:30,186 --> 01:10:31,520
- Sorry, man.
- Thank you.

1345
01:10:31,687 --> 01:10:35,649
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

1346
01:10:39,321 --> 01:10:40,780
I haven't used a gun since Uam.

1347
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:44,867
Angie, you have exhibited
poor decision-making skills.

1348
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:46,035
Oh, this is my fault.

1349
01:10:46,203 --> 01:10:48,955
And we have hosted violence
in our home because of it.

1350
01:10:49,123 --> 01:10:51,082
- "Hosted violence"?
- He's a bad guy.

1351
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,875
You don't see that
you have stooped way, way below...

1352
01:10:54,043 --> 01:10:56,962
- You lowered your expectations...
...of what you are worthy of.

1353
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:00,049
...but this guy is so far beneath you.
You deserve much better.

1354
01:11:00,217 --> 01:11:02,218
Open your heart
to someone who deserves you.

1355
01:11:02,386 --> 01:11:04,429
Or don't have a boyfriend
at all for a while.

1356
01:11:04,596 --> 01:11:06,389
- We're stuck in this room.
- I love him.

1357
01:11:06,557 --> 01:11:08,182
- It's not your decision.
- Love him?

1358
01:11:08,349 --> 01:11:11,017
- You don't know What love is.
- I'm gonna date him.

1359
01:11:11,185 --> 01:11:13,395
- We're going to the police.
- That's what I said.

1360
01:11:13,563 --> 01:11:15,730
- I know.
- He said not to go to the police.

1361
01:11:15,898 --> 01:11:18,317
- You should listen. He's a lawyer.
- You come with us.

1362
01:11:18,485 --> 01:11:21,070
- He can't possibly work in law.
- I'm not going anywhere.

1363
01:11:21,238 --> 01:11:22,405
- You stay.
- We're leaving.

1364
01:11:22,573 --> 01:11:24,657
- You stay in the room.
- Fine, go. Fine, go.

1365
01:11:24,825 --> 01:11:27,576
And we don't need the shampoos.
Why did...?

1366
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:32,998
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

1367
01:11:33,166 --> 01:11:34,916
...l'm moving on.

1368
01:11:39,173 --> 01:11:40,756
Okay.

1369
01:11:40,924 --> 01:11:42,508
All right.

1370
01:11:43,302 --> 01:11:46,762
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

1371
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,222
As sure as shit you will.

1372
01:11:48,390 --> 01:11:50,183
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

1373
01:11:50,350 --> 01:11:53,853
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

1374
01:11:54,021 --> 01:11:56,606
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

1375
01:11:56,773 --> 01:11:59,274
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

1376
01:11:59,442 --> 01:12:01,610
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

1377
01:12:02,111 --> 01:12:03,820
So smile.

1378
01:12:03,988 --> 01:12:05,572
Shut up.

1379
01:12:07,992 --> 01:12:12,329
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

1380
01:12:13,705 --> 01:12:15,498
All right. Are you using protection?

1381
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:16,749
- Days Inn.
- Yes.

1382
01:12:16,917 --> 01:12:18,793
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

1383
01:12:19,628 --> 01:12:21,546
- Hello?
- Hello, is Angie there?

1384
01:12:21,714 --> 01:12:23,548
- Dale.
- Angie?

1385
01:12:23,716 --> 01:12:26,426
- My God, are you okay?
- I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.

1386
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,927
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1387
01:12:28,095 --> 01:12:29,679
Okay, good. I came up with a plan.

1388
01:12:29,847 --> 01:12:32,015
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

1389
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,059
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

1390
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:40,148
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

1391
01:12:40,315 --> 01:12:43,192
I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...

1392
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,236
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

1393
01:12:46,404 --> 01:12:47,946
I can't be addicted to marijuana.

1394
01:12:48,114 --> 01:12:51,283
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

1395
01:12:51,451 --> 01:12:54,327
B, what does that have to do with
anything? I witnessed murder.

1396
01:12:54,496 --> 01:12:55,788
And nowI'm dealing With it.

1397
01:12:55,956 --> 01:12:58,458
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

1398
01:12:58,625 --> 01:13:01,127
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

1399
01:13:01,295 --> 01:13:02,795
- We have to work through it.
- No.

1400
01:13:02,963 --> 01:13:04,422
This doesn't happen to anyone.

1401
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:07,049
I should not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

1402
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:08,550
You know what? It's over.

1403
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,219
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

1404
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:14,724
Congratulations. Sad to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

1405
01:13:14,892 --> 01:13:16,225
What the fuck does that mean?

1406
01:13:16,393 --> 01:13:19,062
It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.

1407
01:13:19,229 --> 01:13:21,314
You'll get into
Godspeed Nou! Black Emperor...

1408
01:13:21,482 --> 01:13:22,648
...and the fucking Shins.

1409
01:13:22,816 --> 01:13:25,401
And you'll blow a bunch of dudes
and become a lesbian...

1410
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:28,279
...and I'll be here in fucking
Clark County doing shit-all.

1411
01:13:28,447 --> 01:13:30,865
You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time.

1412
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:33,116
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

1413
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:35,036
You never did like me anyway,
did you?

1414
01:13:35,204 --> 01:13:36,746
You didn't wanna meet my parents.

1415
01:13:36,914 --> 01:13:39,498
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

1416
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:40,916
I always care about you.

1417
01:13:41,084 --> 01:13:42,918
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

1418
01:13:43,086 --> 01:13:45,504
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

1419
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:49,800
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

1420
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,010
Call me when I can go home.

1421
01:13:52,929 --> 01:13:57,433
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

1422
01:13:57,601 --> 01:14:00,812
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

1423
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:03,689
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

1424
01:14:03,857 --> 01:14:07,985
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

1425
01:14:08,153 --> 01:14:09,695
I love you.

1426
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:12,031
You wise-ass.

1427
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,618
Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

1428
01:14:15,786 --> 01:14:18,204
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

1429
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:19,455
First things first.

1430
01:14:21,415 --> 01:14:24,835
- Don't do that, okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

1431
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:27,170
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

1432
01:14:27,338 --> 01:14:28,797
That clearly just happened...

1433
01:14:28,965 --> 01:14:31,299
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

1434
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:33,469
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

1435
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:35,805
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

1436
01:14:35,973 --> 01:14:38,808
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

1437
01:14:38,976 --> 01:14:41,477
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

1438
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:44,981
- We are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

1439
01:14:45,149 --> 01:14:47,899
Well, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

1440
01:14:48,067 --> 01:14:50,902
I was, like, stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

1441
01:14:51,070 --> 01:14:52,488
What do you gotta say to that?

1442
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:55,241
Well, that would be true
if you had saved me.

1443
01:14:55,409 --> 01:14:56,534
But you didn't save me.

1444
01:14:56,702 --> 01:14:58,619
She was gonna help,
you made things Worse.

1445
01:14:58,787 --> 01:15:00,663
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

1446
01:15:00,831 --> 01:15:02,832
Don't fucking get on my case,
all right?

1447
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,667
Only reason I started selling pot...

1448
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:07,420
...is so I could put my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.

1449
01:15:07,588 --> 01:15:09,754
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

1450
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,257
I'm gonna become something.

1451
01:15:11,425 --> 01:15:13,968
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

1452
01:15:14,136 --> 01:15:16,470
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

1453
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:18,139
Little kids can take shits.

1454
01:15:18,307 --> 01:15:19,931
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

1455
01:15:20,099 --> 01:15:22,184
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

1456
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:24,936
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

1457
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:28,315
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

1458
01:15:28,482 --> 01:15:30,902
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

1459
01:15:31,069 --> 01:15:33,571
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

1460
01:15:33,739 --> 01:15:35,573
Boring people to death on the radio.

1461
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:39,368
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

1462
01:15:39,536 --> 01:15:41,370
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

1463
01:15:41,538 --> 01:15:44,540
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

1464
01:15:44,708 --> 01:15:46,334
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

1465
01:15:46,501 --> 01:15:49,003
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

1466
01:15:49,171 --> 01:15:50,964
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

1467
01:15:51,132 --> 01:15:53,467
You were cold and I clothed you.

1468
01:15:53,926 --> 01:15:57,219
Now about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

1469
01:15:57,386 --> 01:15:59,054
You didn't say anything back.

1470
01:15:59,222 --> 01:16:01,765
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

1471
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,391
You are my drug dealer.

1472
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,310
There's one reason
we know each other.

1473
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,520
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

1474
01:16:07,688 --> 01:16:10,900
If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you Were...

1475
01:16:11,068 --> 01:16:14,237
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

1476
01:16:16,198 --> 01:16:19,200
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

1477
01:16:19,368 --> 01:16:20,910
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

1478
01:16:21,078 --> 01:16:23,537
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

1479
01:16:23,705 --> 01:16:25,748
What? That's not even
an expression.

1480
01:16:25,916 --> 01:16:28,625
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

1481
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,670
I'm sorry, man. Look...

1482
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:34,632
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

1483
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:37,385
Come on, man. Don't do that.

1484
01:16:37,552 --> 01:16:39,637
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

1485
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:42,223
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

1486
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:44,599
I didn't mean that.

1487
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:59,782
I love you. Do you love me?

1488
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,409
That looks great.

1489
01:17:52,044 --> 01:17:53,502
Hello?

1490
01:17:54,588 --> 01:17:55,880
Dale?

1491
01:17:56,048 --> 01:17:57,423
It is Dale.

1492
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:02,470
Angie, I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the World...

1493
01:18:02,637 --> 01:18:06,057
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

1494
01:18:06,224 --> 01:18:07,975
I'll do anything.

1495
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:11,729
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

1496
01:18:11,897 --> 01:18:14,607
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it, okay?

1497
01:18:14,775 --> 01:18:16,942
So please
just take me back, please.

1498
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:19,195
- I love you.
- I love you.

1499
01:18:20,571 --> 01:18:23,531
- Yeah?
- I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.

1500
01:18:23,699 --> 01:18:27,161
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

1501
01:18:27,329 --> 01:18:28,537
I don't know. I just...

1502
01:18:28,705 --> 01:18:30,122
I wanna marry you.

1503
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,877
I made a mistake.

1504
01:18:35,045 --> 01:18:37,380
- What do you mean?
- I've...

1505
01:18:37,798 --> 01:18:40,216
- What?
- I'm just processing that last bit.

1506
01:18:40,384 --> 01:18:42,967
- You wanna... Oh, fuck.
- What?

1507
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:44,719
I don't know.

1508
01:18:44,887 --> 01:18:47,014
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

1509
01:18:47,182 --> 01:18:49,100
...then you are very naive
and immature.

1510
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:52,853
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

1511
01:18:53,021 --> 01:18:56,148
- You're the one that's immature.
- I'm not immature. You're immature.

1512
01:18:56,316 --> 01:18:59,527
I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older.

1513
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:00,986
Just because you're older.

1514
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:03,697
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

1515
01:19:03,865 --> 01:19:06,034
- Really?
- How many girls have you slept with?

1516
01:19:06,202 --> 01:19:08,285
- Like, two and a half.
- Two and a half?

1517
01:19:08,453 --> 01:19:09,662
What is a half? Your hand?

1518
01:19:09,830 --> 01:19:12,748
No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.
I can't remember why.

1519
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:15,583
I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."

1520
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:18,128
If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.
I was drunk.

1521
01:19:18,295 --> 01:19:19,629
Screw you.

1522
01:19:19,797 --> 01:19:20,964
Get me out of this room.

1523
01:19:21,132 --> 01:19:24,217
I will, and that's the last
you'll ever hear from me, okay?

1524
01:19:26,388 --> 01:19:30,182
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

1525
01:19:33,395 --> 01:19:35,688
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

1526
01:19:37,107 --> 01:19:38,441
Lookit there. Lookit there.

1527
01:19:38,608 --> 01:19:40,443
Do you use the pool over here?

1528
01:19:40,610 --> 01:19:43,362
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

1529
01:19:43,530 --> 01:19:46,741
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

1530
01:19:46,909 --> 01:19:48,826
What are you talking about,
my grandson?

1531
01:19:48,994 --> 01:19:51,745
You told me you wanna sit down,
play dominos with me.

1532
01:19:51,913 --> 01:19:53,914
And nowyou're hocking me
about my grandson.

1533
01:19:54,082 --> 01:19:56,749
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1534
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,042
May I call you Faye?

1535
01:19:58,210 --> 01:20:01,337
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

1536
01:20:01,505 --> 01:20:03,047
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

1537
01:20:03,215 --> 01:20:04,758
What do you want from me?

1538
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:06,302
Bubbe. Hey, guys.

1539
01:20:06,470 --> 01:20:08,971
- Well, look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

1540
01:20:13,059 --> 01:20:14,101
Damn.

1541
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,353
Oh, shit.

1542
01:20:16,521 --> 01:20:18,147
Sorry, Betty.

1543
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,904
They kidnapped my grandson.

1544
01:20:25,071 --> 01:20:26,989
Yeah, these tWo guys came in...

1545
01:20:27,157 --> 01:20:30,159
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

1546
01:20:30,327 --> 01:20:32,411
I never saw them in my life before.

1547
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:35,748
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

1548
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:40,377
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

1549
01:20:40,545 --> 01:20:44,340
And the other guy,
he was very good-looking...

1550
01:20:44,508 --> 01:20:45,841
...but he was short as shit.

1551
01:20:46,009 --> 01:20:47,927
But the Worst part was...

1552
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:52,473
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

1553
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:54,642
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

1554
01:20:54,809 --> 01:20:56,059
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

1555
01:20:56,227 --> 01:20:58,102
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

1556
01:20:58,270 --> 01:20:59,812
I believe that's a mole, ma,am.

1557
01:21:05,487 --> 01:21:08,697
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

1558
01:21:08,865 --> 01:21:10,616
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

1559
01:21:10,784 --> 01:21:13,619
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

1560
01:21:13,787 --> 01:21:15,996
Where am I, man? What?

1561
01:21:16,164 --> 01:21:19,625
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

1562
01:21:19,793 --> 01:21:21,126
Shit. Did I do that?

1563
01:21:22,797 --> 01:21:25,799
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

1564
01:21:26,425 --> 01:21:28,301
Fuck you, man!

1565
01:21:28,469 --> 01:21:31,178
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

1566
01:21:31,346 --> 01:21:32,679
Ted wants him alive, okay?

1567
01:21:32,846 --> 01:21:34,847
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

1568
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:38,393
- If anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like hamburglar.

1569
01:21:38,561 --> 01:21:39,602
And the Elephant Man.

1570
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:41,981
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

1571
01:21:42,148 --> 01:21:43,899
Professional. Professional.

1572
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:46,193
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever, man.

1573
01:21:46,361 --> 01:21:48,487
- Where were you?
- I was there.

1574
01:21:48,655 --> 01:21:50,531
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

1575
01:21:50,699 --> 01:21:52,366
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

1576
01:21:52,534 --> 01:21:54,743
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

1577
01:21:54,911 --> 01:21:57,288
Fuck all this, you know?
Get him out of here.

1578
01:21:57,455 --> 01:22:00,709
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

1579
01:22:00,876 --> 01:22:03,043
I don't wanna go near this guy.

1580
01:22:03,211 --> 01:22:06,171
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

1581
01:22:06,339 --> 01:22:07,965
I might act tough...

1582
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:10,217
...but I got a lot of feelings.

1583
01:22:10,594 --> 01:22:13,512
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

1584
01:22:14,556 --> 01:22:16,265
This ain't over.

1585
01:22:16,725 --> 01:22:18,601
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

1586
01:22:18,768 --> 01:22:20,811
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

1587
01:22:20,979 --> 01:22:24,273
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

1588
01:22:24,441 --> 01:22:26,692
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be like:

1589
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,945
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

1590
01:22:30,113 --> 01:22:31,113
Watch your head.

1591
01:22:33,074 --> 01:22:34,867
Hey, watch him.

1592
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:37,952
Oh, my God.

1593
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:40,456
El Dorado.

1594
01:22:40,790 --> 01:22:43,000
The legends are true.

1595
01:22:43,627 --> 01:22:45,794
Look at all this weed, man.

1596
01:22:45,962 --> 01:22:47,713
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

1597
01:22:47,881 --> 01:22:50,257
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

1598
01:22:50,425 --> 01:22:52,217
OG Kush?

1599
01:22:52,385 --> 01:22:53,719
OG Kush.

1600
01:23:00,895 --> 01:23:03,521
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

1601
01:23:03,689 --> 01:23:05,357
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

1602
01:23:05,524 --> 01:23:07,441
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

1603
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:24,625
Hello?

1604
01:23:24,793 --> 01:23:26,168
Red?

1605
01:23:32,342 --> 01:23:34,259
- Red?
- What the fuck?

1606
01:23:34,427 --> 01:23:37,221
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

1607
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:40,517
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

1608
01:23:40,685 --> 01:23:42,102
Good.

1609
01:23:42,269 --> 01:23:45,020
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeling so hot.

1610
01:23:45,188 --> 01:23:47,022
You don't look great.

1611
01:23:47,190 --> 01:23:48,732
They shot me, Denton.

1612
01:23:48,900 --> 01:23:50,192
They got me right here.

1613
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:51,694
- Yeah?
- Right here.

1614
01:23:51,861 --> 01:23:53,696
And then they got me again
right here.

1615
01:23:53,863 --> 01:23:57,073
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

1616
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,784
They'll save your life, okay?

1617
01:23:58,952 --> 01:24:00,869
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

1618
01:24:01,037 --> 01:24:03,664
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

1619
01:24:03,832 --> 01:24:06,083
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

1620
01:24:06,251 --> 01:24:08,377
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

1621
01:24:08,545 --> 01:24:11,463
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kill me.

1622
01:24:11,631 --> 01:24:13,257
He's just, like, an asshole.

1623
01:24:13,425 --> 01:24:16,385
I couldn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

1624
01:24:16,553 --> 01:24:18,387
You know Ted? He took Saul.

1625
01:24:18,555 --> 01:24:19,930
And I'm gonna get him back.

1626
01:24:20,098 --> 01:24:22,099
You know, like, he saved my life.

1627
01:24:22,267 --> 01:24:25,394
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

1628
01:24:25,562 --> 01:24:28,397
He is. I'll tell you that, man.
Saul is a good dude.

1629
01:24:28,565 --> 01:24:29,648
I was mean to him, man.

1630
01:24:29,816 --> 01:24:32,568
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

1631
01:24:32,736 --> 01:24:36,405
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

1632
01:24:36,573 --> 01:24:40,452
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

1633
01:24:40,619 --> 01:24:42,579
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

1634
01:24:42,747 --> 01:24:46,707
And it's a shell, and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

1635
01:24:46,875 --> 01:24:51,002
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

1636
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,546
Except, if you're a dick
your whole life...

1637
01:24:53,714 --> 01:24:56,592
...your next shell
will be made of shit, okay?

1638
01:24:56,760 --> 01:24:59,511
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

1639
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:03,432
Or a Worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

1640
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,976
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

1641
01:25:06,144 --> 01:25:07,728
...you'll come back as an eagle.

1642
01:25:07,896 --> 01:25:09,438
You'll come back as a dragon.

1643
01:25:09,606 --> 01:25:11,273
You'll come back as Jude Law.

1644
01:25:12,108 --> 01:25:14,276
Okay? Which would you rather be?

1645
01:25:14,444 --> 01:25:17,781
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

1646
01:25:17,948 --> 01:25:18,990
It belongs to me.

1647
01:25:19,158 --> 01:25:20,617
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

1648
01:25:20,785 --> 01:25:24,620
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

1649
01:25:24,788 --> 01:25:25,996
You'll have a second wind.

1650
01:25:26,164 --> 01:25:28,582
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

1651
01:25:28,750 --> 01:25:31,417
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

1652
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:34,754
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

1653
01:25:34,922 --> 01:25:37,216
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

1654
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,051
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

1655
01:25:39,219 --> 01:25:41,512
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna
help you, Dale"...

1656
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:43,472
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

1657
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:46,475
Come here.

1658
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:53,357
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

1659
01:25:55,820 --> 01:25:57,903
Thug life.

1660
01:26:03,868 --> 01:26:05,118
Oh, shit.

1661
01:26:05,286 --> 01:26:07,996
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

1662
01:26:08,164 --> 01:26:10,249
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

1663
01:26:17,216 --> 01:26:19,925
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

1664
01:26:24,931 --> 01:26:28,016
Don't.

1665
01:26:28,184 --> 01:26:29,852
Just something quick like that.

1666
01:26:30,019 --> 01:26:31,519
- Don't.
- Yeah.

1667
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:33,856
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

1668
01:26:47,120 --> 01:26:48,954
Oh, God.

1669
01:26:51,624 --> 01:26:53,710
That's a big hideout.

1670
01:26:55,629 --> 01:26:57,672
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

1671
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:00,800
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

1672
01:27:00,968 --> 01:27:03,887
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

1673
01:27:04,054 --> 01:27:06,471
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

1674
01:27:06,639 --> 01:27:08,723
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

1675
01:27:08,891 --> 01:27:11,809
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

1676
01:27:11,977 --> 01:27:14,146
Oh, man, no.
This is lame of you, man.

1677
01:27:14,314 --> 01:27:16,690
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

1678
01:27:16,858 --> 01:27:18,066
This could be your moment.

1679
01:27:18,234 --> 01:27:20,777
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine, go.

1680
01:27:20,945 --> 01:27:21,987
Fuck you.

1681
01:27:22,155 --> 01:27:24,323
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

1682
01:27:24,490 --> 01:27:28,702
Legends never die, dude.
I'll tell your story.

1683
01:27:29,412 --> 01:27:32,248
Carol, she's cool now.

1684
01:27:32,416 --> 01:27:36,377
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

1685
01:27:36,545 --> 01:27:38,837
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

1686
01:27:39,005 --> 01:27:41,423
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

1687
01:27:41,591 --> 01:27:43,884
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

1688
01:27:44,052 --> 01:27:46,261
All right, everybody be cool, man.
Be cool.

1689
01:27:46,429 --> 01:27:47,971
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

1690
01:27:48,139 --> 01:27:49,765
Put them down. On the ground.

1691
01:27:49,933 --> 01:27:52,268
All right, everybody just chill.

1692
01:27:52,436 --> 01:27:54,354
Oh, my God!

1693
01:27:54,521 --> 01:27:56,188
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

1694
01:27:56,356 --> 01:27:58,899
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

1695
01:27:59,067 --> 01:28:01,360
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

1696
01:28:01,527 --> 01:28:03,320
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

1697
01:28:03,488 --> 01:28:06,239
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

1698
01:28:06,407 --> 01:28:08,909
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

1699
01:28:09,077 --> 01:28:10,994
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

1700
01:28:11,163 --> 01:28:13,288
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

1701
01:28:13,456 --> 01:28:15,290
End of story.

1702
01:28:15,458 --> 01:28:17,459
I'm telling Ted.

1703
01:28:17,627 --> 01:28:19,419
- If you do...
- He's got a piece.

1704
01:28:19,587 --> 01:28:21,171
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1705
01:28:21,339 --> 01:28:23,006
He's got another one, in the side.

1706
01:28:23,174 --> 01:28:24,800
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

1707
01:28:24,968 --> 01:28:27,219
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

1708
01:28:27,387 --> 01:28:29,554
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

1709
01:28:29,722 --> 01:28:30,974
No. Come on.

1710
01:28:34,019 --> 01:28:36,479
- Oh, great.
- Saul.

1711
01:28:36,647 --> 01:28:37,772
- Dale.
- Yes.

1712
01:28:37,940 --> 01:28:41,109
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

1713
01:28:41,276 --> 01:28:43,151
- No, man.
- Yes.

1714
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:44,987
I'm here to save you.

1715
01:28:45,154 --> 01:28:47,822
No. You just got caught too.

1716
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:50,367
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

1717
01:28:50,535 --> 01:28:52,619
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

1718
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:55,622
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole, man.

1719
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:58,959
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

1720
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:02,337
Okay? And I know there's no way...

1721
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:04,923
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

1722
01:29:05,091 --> 01:29:08,176
So that's What I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

1723
01:29:08,344 --> 01:29:10,847
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

1724
01:29:11,015 --> 01:29:12,765
You're a mean jerk.

1725
01:29:12,933 --> 01:29:15,893
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think...

1726
01:29:16,061 --> 01:29:18,312
I didn't Want
you to be my best friend.

1727
01:29:18,480 --> 01:29:21,189
I didn't Wanna think
that that's what my life was.

1728
01:29:21,357 --> 01:29:23,817
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

1729
01:29:23,985 --> 01:29:25,485
You're the best guy I know.

1730
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:27,487
BFFF.

1731
01:29:27,655 --> 01:29:30,074
Best fucking friends forever, man.
Seriously.

1732

- All right. Give me a hug.
- Yeah. Okay.

1733
01:29:35,788 --> 01:29:38,206

I'm so sorry about everything.

1734
01:29:38,374 --> 01:29:39,708
Oh, I'm such a dick.

1735
01:29:39,876 --> 01:29:43,045
- Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
- No, you're not, but it's okay.

1736
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,089
These guys are gonna fucking kill us.
We gotta get out of here.

1737
01:29:46,257 --> 01:29:48,008
- I know. They are.

1738
01:29:48,176 --> 01:29:52,512
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, all right?

1739
01:29:52,680 --> 01:29:55,223
- Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
- Shut the fuck up.

1740
01:29:55,391 --> 01:29:57,559
Do you know

01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:01,188
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.

against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

1745
01:30:10,282 --> 01:30:11,908

- I can't feel it.

1746
01:30:12,076 --> 01:30:13,076

01:30:21,125 --> 01:30:23,001
It's not Working.
We gotta change angles.

1752
01:30:23,169 --> 01:30:25,420
We gotta
get more leverage-y. Okay.

1753
01:30:25,588 --> 01:30:27,088
Okay, that's good. That's good.

01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:29,174

1760
01:30:43,147 --> 01:30:45,107

1761
01:30:45,274 --> 01:30:47,401
Come on. Let's go.

1762
01:30:47,569 --> 01:30:49,445
Harder.

1763
01:30:58,038 --> 01:31:00,455
- Where are these fuckers?
- We got them downstairs.

1764
01:31:00,623 --> 01:31:03,291
- Where did you find them?
- Found Saul at his grandmother's.

1765
01:31:03,459 --> 01:31:06,378
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

1766
01:31:06,546 --> 01:31:07,963
It's gross.

1767
01:31:08,131 --> 01:31:10,423
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

1768
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:14,386
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

1769
01:31:14,554 --> 01:31:16,763
Plugged him, just whacked him.

1770
01:31:16,931 --> 01:31:20,142
How they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

1771
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:21,893
He shot Pete?

1772
01:31:22,061 --> 01:31:24,062
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

1773
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:26,774
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

1774
01:31:26,942 --> 01:31:30,236
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

1775
01:31:34,782 --> 01:31:36,825
Time to cook shit up tonight.

1776
01:31:36,993 --> 01:31:39,035
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

1777
01:31:40,413 --> 01:31:42,330
Stop. Wait here.

1778
01:31:42,498 --> 01:31:45,250
No retreat, no surrender.

1779
01:31:50,716 --> 01:31:51,757
Yes, yes, yes.

1780
01:31:51,925 --> 01:31:54,759
- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay.

1781
01:31:54,927 --> 01:31:58,346
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

1782
01:31:58,514 --> 01:32:00,682
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

1783
01:32:00,850 --> 01:32:02,767
Just don't. Don't...

1784
01:32:08,357 --> 01:32:11,443
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

1785
01:32:11,611 --> 01:32:15,697
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

1786
01:32:15,865 --> 01:32:17,365
Stop.

1787
01:32:20,745 --> 01:32:23,330
See, I don't think
you understood me.

1788
01:32:23,497 --> 01:32:25,333
I can hear everything you're saying.

1789
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:28,211
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

1790
01:32:28,378 --> 01:32:30,880
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

1791
01:32:31,048 --> 01:32:33,299
Y,all fuck on your own time, man.

1792
01:32:33,467 --> 01:32:35,051
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

1793
01:32:35,219 --> 01:32:37,637
What the fuck is that?

1794
01:32:39,932 --> 01:32:40,972

1796
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,151
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

1797
01:32:59,659 --> 01:33:01,159
You shot me.

1798
01:33:01,327 --> 01:33:02,702
I'm sorry, man.

1799
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:06,582
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

1800
01:33:06,750 --> 01:33:08,376
I got glass in my ass.

1801
01:33:08,543 --> 01:33:11,128
- Dale. Dale!
- This is messed up.

1802
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,422
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

1803
01:33:15,758 --> 01:33:17,801
Asians!

1804
01:33:22,765 --> 01:33:23,766

No, wake up, man.

1813
01:33:58,676 --> 01:34:00,552
No, you're not dying, man.

1814
01:34:00,720 --> 01:34:03,306
Not without me.

1815
01:34:03,473 --> 01:34:04,807
- Dale.
- What?

1816
01:34:04,975 --> 01:34:06,809
You're alive.

1817
01:34:06,977 --> 01:34:10,479
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

1818
01:34:11,064 --> 01:34:13,149
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

1819
01:34:13,317 --> 01:34:16,027
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

1820
01:34:17,154 --> 01:34:18,820
Fuck!

1821
01:34:21,072 --> 01:34:22,574
- Help!
- My ear.

1822
01:34:22,742 --> 01:34:23,783
- Yeah.
- Help!

1823
01:34:23,951 --> 01:34:26,036
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

1824
01:34:26,203 --> 01:34:28,121
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

1825
01:34:28,289 --> 01:34:29,331
You shot him?

1826
01:34:29,498 --> 01:34:31,708
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

1827
01:34:31,876 --> 01:34:33,501
We've had enough out of you.

1828
01:34:33,669 --> 01:34:34,919
I'm not your friend.

1829
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:36,463
Maybe I can just...

1830
01:34:36,630 --> 01:34:38,631
No. No, infected.

1831
01:34:38,799 --> 01:34:41,176
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

1832
01:35:15,711 --> 01:35:17,379
It's clear.

1833
01:35:18,297 --> 01:35:20,633
Dude. Look.

1834
01:35:20,801 --> 01:35:22,385
Nice.

1835
01:35:34,730 --> 01:35:36,231
Bullets.

1836
01:35:44,408 --> 01:35:47,243
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

1837
01:35:47,411 --> 01:35:50,746
Is it really disgusting
or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

1838
01:35:50,914 --> 01:35:52,957
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

1839
01:35:53,125 --> 01:35:55,083
I feel like I can smell it.

1840
01:35:55,251 --> 01:35:57,752
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

1841
01:35:57,920 --> 01:35:58,962
You can't even tell.

1842
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:00,256
That's a good point.

1843
01:36:00,424 --> 01:36:01,798
Wait.

1844
01:36:44,508 --> 01:36:45,884
Did you shoot that guy?

1845
01:36:46,051 --> 01:36:47,635
No. I'm out of bullets.

1846
01:36:47,803 --> 01:36:49,345
Me too.

1847
01:36:49,513 --> 01:36:51,806
Maybe it was ricochet.

1848
01:36:51,974 --> 01:36:53,975
Gravity.

1849
01:36:54,143 --> 01:36:55,852
Oh, nice.

1850
01:36:56,020 --> 01:36:57,980
You go down.

1851
01:36:58,148 --> 01:36:59,315
I'll cover.

1852
01:36:59,483 --> 01:37:02,651
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

1853
01:37:07,157 --> 01:37:08,990
Sexy motherfucker.

1854
01:37:27,636 --> 01:37:30,012
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

1855
01:37:30,179 --> 01:37:32,472
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

1856
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:35,850
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

1857
01:37:37,604 --> 01:37:39,396
Oh, nice.

1858
01:37:40,899 --> 01:37:42,524
Here we go. Okay.

1859
01:37:42,691 --> 01:37:45,610
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

1860
01:37:48,531 --> 01:37:49,531
Nice.

1861
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:52,033
Nice. Okay.

1862
01:37:52,201 --> 01:37:53,451
Pull me up.

1863
01:37:53,619 --> 01:37:55,411
I'm ready. Go.

1864
01:37:55,579 --> 01:37:57,373
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

1865
01:37:57,541 --> 01:38:00,000
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

1866
01:38:00,168 --> 01:38:02,169
- Pull harder.
- Dale, come on.

1867
01:38:02,337 --> 01:38:05,047
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

1868
01:38:05,215 --> 01:38:08,050
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

1869
01:38:10,971 --> 01:38:12,012
Dale!

1870
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:13,722
I'll get help. I'll get help.

1871
01:38:15,517 --> 01:38:18,726
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

1872
01:39:46,399 --> 01:39:48,233
Give me that fire extinguisher.

1873
01:39:48,401 --> 01:39:49,610
Okay.

1874
01:40:10,923 --> 01:40:14,259
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

1875
01:40:14,427 --> 01:40:15,594
Now!

1876
01:40:30,526 --> 01:40:31,651
Fuck you!

1877
01:40:36,783 --> 01:40:39,702
Fuck the police!

1878
01:41:00,223 --> 01:41:02,558
Motherfucking kill you!

1879
01:41:04,977 --> 01:41:07,520
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

1880
01:41:08,605 --> 01:41:10,106
Oh, shit!

1881
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:11,483
Come here!

1882
01:41:18,825 --> 01:41:20,743
I hate you!

1883
01:41:20,910 --> 01:41:23,203
No! Ted, stop it!

1884
01:41:30,127 --> 01:41:33,046
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

1885
01:41:33,214 --> 01:41:35,174
You're in the jungle now, baby.

1886
01:41:43,140 --> 01:41:44,223
Jesus!

1887
01:41:51,608 --> 01:41:53,150
Fuck.

1888
01:42:02,410 --> 01:42:03,952
Gonna die.

1889
01:42:06,623 --> 01:42:08,957
- You killed...
- I didn't wanna do that.

1890
01:42:10,044 --> 01:42:11,960
But you weren't gonna stop.

1891
01:42:18,509 --> 01:42:20,092
Shoot him!

1892
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:22,595
Just take it easy, buddy.

1893
01:42:24,348 --> 01:42:26,724
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

1894
01:42:29,854 --> 01:42:31,647
I'm hungry.

1895
01:42:31,815 --> 01:42:33,732
I'm going home.

1896
01:42:37,654 --> 01:42:39,321
All right.

1897
01:42:40,907 --> 01:42:42,574
Help.

1898
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:47,078
I knew you were going soft.

1899
01:42:47,246 --> 01:42:50,332
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

1900
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:52,584
Fucked up, man.

1901
01:42:54,796 --> 01:42:58,340
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.
- Oh, man.

1902
01:42:58,508 --> 01:42:59,967
What's up, sir?

1903
01:43:00,593 --> 01:43:04,388
- Look, I didn't Wanna hit you, man...
- Shut the fuck up.

1904
01:43:04,556 --> 01:43:09,059
You think you was gonna
get me, motherfucker, huh?

1905
01:43:09,227 --> 01:43:11,854
You need to sit
your little sexy ass down...

1906
01:43:12,021 --> 01:43:14,147
...and watch yourself get killed now.

1907
01:43:14,315 --> 01:43:15,732
All right.

1908
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,984
You know what?
This is how it's gonna be?

1909
01:43:18,151 --> 01:43:21,737
All right. This is howit ends.

1910
01:43:37,881 --> 01:43:42,009
You just got killed by a
Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

1911
01:43:42,176 --> 01:43:43,677
How you like me now, huh?

1912
01:43:45,013 --> 01:43:46,179
Gross.

1913
01:43:46,347 --> 01:43:47,390
Red?

1914
01:43:47,851 --> 01:43:49,018
Saul.

1915
01:43:49,186 --> 01:43:52,062
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

1916
01:43:52,230 --> 01:43:53,896
- Yeah.
- I remembered, man.

1917
01:43:54,731 --> 01:43:56,232
Bro's before ho's.

1918
01:43:56,942 --> 01:43:59,902
- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

1919
01:44:00,070 --> 01:44:04,531
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

1920
01:44:04,699 --> 01:44:08,286
Honestly, like, from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

1921
01:44:08,454 --> 01:44:12,249
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's
nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

1922
01:44:12,416 --> 01:44:15,418
...I Wanna be a better friend to you,
like I really am.

1923
01:44:16,212 --> 01:44:19,089
I fucking love you, dog.
Fucking love you.

1924
01:44:19,715 --> 01:44:21,800
I wanna be inside you, homes.

1925
01:44:23,052 --> 01:44:24,802
No more lies, Red.

1926
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:27,514
- This is my moment.
- This is your moment.

1927
01:44:30,101 --> 01:44:31,601
Red!

1928
01:44:49,287 --> 01:44:52,205
You know what? I'm feeling it.

1929
01:44:52,373 --> 01:44:54,249
Red, I'm coming, baby.

1930
01:44:54,417 --> 01:44:56,835
Your stupidity amazes me.

1931
01:44:59,254 --> 01:45:01,005
Hey, Ted!

1932
01:45:01,172 --> 01:45:03,132
You killed my brother...

1933
01:45:03,300 --> 01:45:06,428
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

1934
01:45:06,595 --> 01:45:09,639
Suck my balls! TWo times!

1935
01:45:17,481 --> 01:45:18,565
Bitch!

1936
01:45:18,733 --> 01:45:20,275
Bring it on.

1937
01:45:31,870 --> 01:45:32,911
Shit. Dale.

1938
01:45:34,456 --> 01:45:36,665
Dale!

1939
01:45:36,833 --> 01:45:38,500
Holy shit!

1940
01:46:14,997 --> 01:46:16,039
Sorry, Ted.

1941
01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:22,169
Yo? 've been served.

1942
01:46:29,303 --> 01:46:34,766
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

1943
01:46:39,062 --> 01:46:40,687
Sa? I! Sa? I!

1944
01:46:46,237 --> 01:46:49,197
Wake up, man! This place
is gonna collapse! Come on!

1945
01:46:49,365 --> 01:46:51,199
Come to me!

1946
01:46:53,244 --> 01:46:55,078
Yo? 're not dying today, friend.

1947
01:46:55,246 --> 01:46:58,123
Not on my watch.

1948
01:47:25,109 --> 01:47:28,319
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

1949
01:47:28,487 --> 01:47:29,946
Saul.

1950
01:47:30,114 --> 01:47:31,614
Wake up.

1951
01:47:31,782 --> 01:47:34,200
Oh, sweet Saul.

1952
01:47:36,704 --> 01:47:39,414
Saul.

1953
01:47:42,252 --> 01:47:44,044
Yes. Yeah.

1954
01:47:44,212 --> 01:47:45,671
Saul, you made it.

1955
01:47:45,839 --> 01:47:48,381
- What?
- Yeah.

1956
01:47:48,549 --> 01:47:50,467
Where am I?

1957
01:47:50,634 --> 01:47:52,677
You made it, man.

1958
01:47:52,845 --> 01:47:55,387
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

1959
01:47:55,555 --> 01:47:58,599
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

1960
01:47:58,766 --> 01:48:01,478
What happened?

1961
01:48:07,985 --> 01:48:10,403
Holy shit.

1962
01:48:14,325 --> 01:48:16,034
What's that?

1963
01:48:18,829 --> 01:48:20,663
Hi.

1964
01:48:20,831 --> 01:48:22,707
- Red?
- Red?

1965
01:48:25,544 --> 01:48:28,338
- Red.
- Hey.

1966
01:48:28,506 --> 01:48:31,841
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

1967
01:48:32,009 --> 01:48:33,092
He came back to save us.

1968
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:34,344
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

1969
01:48:34,512 --> 01:48:35,929
All right, man.

1970
01:48:36,096 --> 01:48:38,223
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

1971
01:48:38,390 --> 01:48:41,267
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

1972
01:48:41,435 --> 01:48:45,063
We made it. Oh, we made it.

1973
01:48:50,528 --> 01:48:55,489
Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.
I am Dale Denton.

1974
01:48:55,657 --> 01:48:59,494
The topic of the day: New beginnings.
Getting over losses.

1975
01:48:59,662 --> 01:49:02,038
Friends. Life.

1976
01:49:02,206 --> 01:49:04,832
We have our first caller.

1977
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:07,627
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

1978
01:49:07,795 --> 01:49:09,420
Hi. Am I on the air?

1979
01:49:09,588 --> 01:49:12,632
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

1980
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:13,883
A D in the face.

1981
01:49:14,051 --> 01:49:15,385
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

1982
01:49:15,553 --> 01:49:20,224
You're my hero.

1983
01:49:20,892 --> 01:49:22,393
You are good, man. Seriously.

1984
01:49:22,561 --> 01:49:24,478
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

1985
01:49:24,646 --> 01:49:26,647
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

1986
01:49:26,814 --> 01:49:29,606
- It's not bad, huh?
- If I close my eyes, it sounds like...

1987
01:49:29,774 --> 01:49:32,901
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

1988
01:49:33,069 --> 01:49:35,904
- If you were on it, I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

1989
01:49:36,072 --> 01:49:38,449
It's like when my bubbe
was always playing opera...

1990
01:49:38,617 --> 01:49:40,451
...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.

1991
01:49:40,619 --> 01:49:43,413
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

1992
01:49:43,581 --> 01:49:46,207
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

1993
01:49:46,375 --> 01:49:48,459
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

1994
01:49:48,627 --> 01:49:50,420
...I like you now.

1995
01:49:50,588 --> 01:49:54,048
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

1996
01:49:54,216 --> 01:49:56,259
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

1997
01:49:56,427 --> 01:49:59,638
Seriously. You guys are, like,
both of my best friends.

1998
01:49:59,806 --> 01:50:02,599
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

1999
01:50:02,766 --> 01:50:04,976
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

2000
01:50:05,144 --> 01:50:06,561
We should get a three-way one.

2001
01:50:06,729 --> 01:50:10,356
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

2002
01:50:10,524 --> 01:50:13,443
I want the middle piece,
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

2003
01:50:13,611 --> 01:50:17,530
I know We've gone over this, but, like,
1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

2004
01:50:17,698 --> 01:50:20,450
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

2005
01:50:20,618 --> 01:50:23,119
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

2006
01:50:23,287 --> 01:50:26,164
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

2007
01:50:26,332 --> 01:50:29,208
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

2008
01:50:29,376 --> 01:50:32,128
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

2009
01:50:32,296 --> 01:50:33,837
Is that us getting a time-share?

2010
01:50:34,005 --> 01:50:36,423
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

2011
01:50:36,591 --> 01:50:38,968
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

2012
01:50:39,136 --> 01:50:41,679
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

2013
01:50:41,847 --> 01:50:44,974
I didn't Wanna hurt you.
It was like, "You better not leave here."

2014
01:50:45,142 --> 01:50:47,143
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

2015
01:50:47,311 --> 01:50:48,770
You fuckhead.

2016
01:50:48,937 --> 01:50:51,481
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

2017
01:50:51,649 --> 01:50:54,275
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was...

2018
01:50:54,443 --> 01:50:57,363
I, like, had my foot
through the window.

2019
01:50:57,530 --> 01:51:01,575
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

2020
01:51:03,328 --> 01:51:06,537
- I just feel different about everything.
- Me too, man. Everything.

2021
01:51:06,705 --> 01:51:08,789
Like, I never Wanna
kill anybody else again.

2022
01:51:08,956 --> 01:51:10,832
- Ever.
- That's something you pretty much...

2023
01:51:11,000 --> 01:51:12,834
You can just kind of
dip your toes into.

2024
01:51:13,002 --> 01:51:14,878
We kind of dipped our toes
into murder.

2025
01:51:15,046 --> 01:51:17,507
I killed six guys, I think.
How many guys did you...?

2026
01:51:17,675 --> 01:51:19,550
- We each shot several people.
- A lot.

2027
01:51:19,718 --> 01:51:21,719
Some people get a taste for it,
but I don't.

2028
01:51:21,887 --> 01:51:25,014
I shot someone who was already dead
so that doesn't count as a murder.

2029
01:51:25,182 --> 01:51:27,350
Apparently you hit him
with your car, I'm told.

2030
01:51:27,518 --> 01:51:30,061
- That... You killed him.
- Okay, so I did murder somebody.

2031
01:51:30,229 --> 01:51:32,563
- You murdered, man.
- Not a big deal. That's cool.

2032
01:51:32,731 --> 01:51:35,316
- That's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed.
- I know.

2033
01:51:35,485 --> 01:51:37,277
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

2034
01:51:37,445 --> 01:51:39,655
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

2035
01:51:39,823 --> 01:51:43,282
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood leff?

2036
01:51:43,450 --> 01:51:46,285
- You've been shot, like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

2037
01:51:46,453 --> 01:51:48,204
- You're losing stuft.
- Yeah.

2038
01:51:48,372 --> 01:51:50,248
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

2039
01:51:50,416 --> 01:51:53,875
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

2040
01:51:56,088 --> 01:51:58,548
It's a miracle.
I think We should all take a moment...

2041
01:51:58,716 --> 01:52:01,300
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

2042
01:52:01,468 --> 01:52:03,469
And that we became friends
in the process...

2043
01:52:03,637 --> 01:52:05,888
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

2044
01:52:06,056 --> 01:52:10,268
Should we touch each other's hands
while We do it? Okay.

2045
01:52:12,312 --> 01:52:13,729
I love you guys.

2046
01:52:13,897 --> 01:52:16,273
I love you dudes so much.

2047
01:52:19,194 --> 01:52:21,862
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

2048
01:52:22,739 --> 01:52:24,198
- Red?
- Red?

2049
01:52:24,366 --> 01:52:26,367
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

2050
01:52:26,535 --> 01:52:27,868
What's up, pal?

2051
01:52:28,787 --> 01:52:30,287
- Hey.
- Hey.

2052
01:52:30,455 --> 01:52:34,167
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

2053
01:52:34,335 --> 01:52:36,586
That's okay. We Won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

2054
01:52:36,754 --> 01:52:40,215
- Oh, God.
- Hey, there's bubbe.

2055
01:52:40,383 --> 01:52:42,508
Come on. Let's get out of here.

2056
01:52:42,676 --> 01:52:44,593
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

2057
01:52:44,761 --> 01:52:46,887
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

2058
01:52:47,055 --> 01:52:48,972
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

2059
01:52:49,139 --> 01:52:51,391
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

2060
01:52:51,559 --> 01:52:53,644
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

2061
01:52:53,812 --> 01:52:56,856
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

2062
01:52:57,023 --> 01:52:58,899
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

2063
01:52:59,067 --> 01:53:00,651
Blood from my ear just...

2064
01:53:00,819 --> 01:53:03,612
You guys smell like shit.

2065
01:53:04,823 --> 01:53:07,491
You are in serious danger.
