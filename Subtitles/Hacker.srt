<i>It all started with
a small immigrant family.</i>

3
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,499
<i>That's me, Alex Danyliuk.</i>

4
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:52,332
<i>And that's my mom and dad,
Mr. and Mrs. Danyliuk.</i>

5
00:00:52,334 --> 00:00:55,766
<i>We left Ukraine
in search of a new life.</i>

6
00:00:55,768 --> 00:00:58,999
- Welcome to Canada.
- Thank you.

7
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,099
<i>We couldn't afford
to live in the city,</i>

8
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:09,232
<i>so we ended up in London...
London, Ontario.</i>

9
00:01:09,234 --> 00:01:12,832
<i>Of course, like most hopeful
immigrants, we found ourselves a house</i>

10
00:01:12,834 --> 00:01:15,432
<i>- that we couldn't
actually pay for...</i>

11
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:17,899
<i>so things got worse.</i>

12
00:01:19,633 --> 00:01:21,766
<i>Mom and dad started
arguing a lot more.</i>

13
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:24,133
<i>But eventually a Russian
friend of the family</i>

14
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:26,932
<i>helped mom get a job as a
bookkeeper's assistant at a bank.</i>

15
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:28,932
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

16
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:30,866
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Danyliuk,
we're calling about</i>

17
00:01:30,868 --> 00:01:34,399
<i>- your overdue payments
on your line of credit.</i>

18
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:36,565
<i>Please give us a call.</i>

19
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,565
Don't touch anything.

20
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:48,766
<i>But dad wasn't of much use.</i>

21
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:51,265
<i>He tried, but people
didn't trust him.</i>

22
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:54,399
<i>So we basically
lived on welfare.</i>

23
00:01:56,566 --> 00:01:58,198
<i>Everything my mom earned
went to pay off the mortgage.</i>

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,999
<i>I didn't have any friends to
play with or socialize with</i>

25
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:06,099
<i>except my mom's computer, and, to
be honest, we got along very well.</i>

26
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:08,265
<i>I'm talking Internet,
video games, forums,</i>

27
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:10,766
<i>chat rooms with random
strangers, all sorts of sites,</i>

28
00:02:10,768 --> 00:02:15,632
<i>easy access to information,
and infinite possibilities.</i>

29
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,499
<i>It was this that made me
want to go to college.</i>

30
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:24,032
<i>I wanted to follow in the footsteps
of Steve Jobs and Bill Gates</i>

31
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:26,732
<i>and one day change the world
for the better.</i>

32
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,966
<i>Fortunately, or unfortunately,</i>

33
00:02:28,968 --> 00:02:33,665
<i>I learned early on that I needed to
save up money for school myself.</i>

34
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:38,099
<i>My very first dollars.</i>

35
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,932
<i>My job was being a clicker.</i>

36
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:51,499
<i>I'd build up traffic to sites
by changing my ip address</i>

37
00:02:51,501 --> 00:02:53,832
<i>and visiting the same site
over and over again.</i>

38
00:02:53,834 --> 00:02:57,298
<i>It was boring,
but it was easy money.</i>

39
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,766
<i>For every 1,000 clicks,
I made $20.</i>

40
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:05,866
<i>It wasn't a lot, but all big
things have small beginnings.</i>

41
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:09,532
<i>Time went by, and I wanted to learn
more about how the world worked,</i>

42
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,465
<i>especially the money world.</i>

43
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:15,265
<i>The Internet was full of ideas and
opinions about the banking system,</i>

44
00:03:15,267 --> 00:03:18,332
<i>the financial crisis, the
vulnerability of the system,</i>

45
00:03:18,334 --> 00:03:20,332
<i>and about the need for change.</i>

46
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,265
<i>But some things
just never changed.</i>

47
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:49,665
<i>So that's how I grew up.</i>

48
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:51,632
<i>As you can see,
it wasn't a fairy tale,</i>

49
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:55,932
<i>but I was hoping
that would change.</i>

50
00:03:55,934 --> 00:03:57,899
Just a coffee, please.

51
00:03:57,901 --> 00:03:59,799
<i>Yesterday,
a cyber-attack</i>

52
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,632
<i>was perpetrated on a number
of government sites and banks.</i>

53
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:06,665
<i>Responsibility for this attack
was claimed by Darkweb,</i>

54
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:10,232
<i>an online criminal organization
led by a hacker named zed.</i>

55
00:04:10,234 --> 00:04:12,832
<i>Now, he is considered to be
an international criminal</i>

56
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:16,165
<i>implicated in dozens of cases
around the world.</i>

57
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:19,665
<i>Now, this video was uploaded
claiming that responsibility.</i>

58
00:04:19,667 --> 00:04:21,565
<i>We are Darkweb.</i>

59
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:25,098
<i>We will not stand by and allow slave
masters to control our lives.</i>

60
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:29,432
<i>We will fight back. We will bring them
down. This is just the beginning.</i>

61
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:36,031
<i>And in other news, the stock market has
been unstable due to these attacks.</i>

62
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,399
Mom, I'm home.

63
00:04:48,266 --> 00:04:50,031
Mom?

64
00:04:50,768 --> 00:04:54,632
Hey, hey, hey. What's wrong?
What's wrong, huh?

65
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,699
Okay, now, mom, that's bullshit.

66
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:06,065
That bank owns the mortgage, and
now they know that I'm unemployed

67
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:08,132
and I can't pay monthly bills.

68
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:10,665
We will lose the house.

69
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:14,365
Okay. Well,
what did dad say?

70
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:18,499
Dad... he's asleep.

71
00:05:34,066 --> 00:05:37,065
Okay. Okay, mom.

72
00:05:37,666 --> 00:05:39,132
What is this?

73
00:05:39,134 --> 00:05:41,265
This is money.
All right, this'll last you

74
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,031
for a few months, and then
after that, I can get more.

75
00:05:44,033 --> 00:05:46,298
Where did you get this?
Did you steal it?

76
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,098
No, no, no.
I didn't steal it.

77
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,532
I been saving up for college.

78
00:05:50,534 --> 00:05:55,365
But how? You never told us,
and... where did you get this?

79
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:56,532
Mom, okay, that doesn't matter.

80
00:05:56,534 --> 00:05:59,332
What matters is we're
not going to lose the house.

81
00:05:59,334 --> 00:06:02,265
I can't take it.
You need to pay for school.

82
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:04,399
Look, mom, please, okay,
I'm an adult.

83
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,699
Okay, I can...
I can get a job.

84
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:10,499
I can... I can make this back,
but, please, take it.

85
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:13,998
What will I say to dad?

86
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,399
Tell him the truth.

87
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,365
<i>Thoughts were
rushing through my head.</i>

88
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:28,499
<i>Why? For what?</i>

89
00:06:28,501 --> 00:06:31,399
<i>I hated the bank
that fired my mom.</i>

90
00:06:31,401 --> 00:06:33,098
<i>Even if the bank had
a hundred reasons,</i>

91
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,365
<i>I still fucking hated them.</i>

92
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:36,132
<i>I spent years saving up
that money.</i>

93
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:39,198
<i>I put down a deposit for school, and
now I risked losing everything.</i>

94
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,165
<i>I had to start over.
I didn't have years to spend.</i>

95
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:49,432
<i>I needed something faster, but the
Internet was just full of scams.</i>

96
00:06:50,867 --> 00:06:54,732
<i>And then,
I remembered something.</i>

97
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:06,065
<i>Darkweb was this online hacker group that
was getting a lot of news at the time.</i>

98
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:08,732
<i>I was surprised that their site
hadn't been shut down.</i>

99
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:10,799
<i>It all seemed
kind of simple at first.</i>

100
00:07:10,801 --> 00:07:13,865
<i>I just needed to make
an account and sign up.</i>

101
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:17,098
<i>But real access wasn't
given out so easily.</i>

102
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,432
"Soldier"?

103
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:35,865
<i>They told me
to do something illegal,</i>

104
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:37,732
<i>like stealing a person's
credit card number,</i>

105
00:07:37,734 --> 00:07:39,632
<i>and that was how
they verified the rookies.</i>

106
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:40,965
<i>To me, this seemed simple,</i>

107
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,799
<i>but I needed a victim,
and I had an idea.</i>

108
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:45,898
<i>- There was
this one guy at school</i>

109
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,799
<i>who really had it coming,
Randy Bickle.</i>

110
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:52,265
Whoo! Maybe next time,
watch where you're going.

111
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:53,931
What's your problem, man?

112
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:55,699
What did you just say to me,
Dostoyevsky?

113
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,432
I said why don't you pick on
somebody your own size, huh?

114
00:07:58,434 --> 00:08:00,165
You want to go? Huh?

115
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:03,665
You want to go?
Huh? Huh?

116
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:06,766
Yeah, next time, asshole.

117
00:08:07,566 --> 00:08:10,132
<i>What a dumb-ass.</i>

118
00:08:10,134 --> 00:08:12,831
<i>I built a pretty simple site
that sold fake supplements,</i>

119
00:08:12,833 --> 00:08:15,632
<i>and Randy fell for it.
He used his dad's credit card,</i>

120
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,632
<i>and it had a lot of money on it.</i>

121
00:08:17,634 --> 00:08:20,798
Dad! Can I use your credit card?

122
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,098
Yes.

123
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,732
<i>I leaked the information to
Darkweb, and before I knew it,</i>

124
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:30,031
<i>one of their guys was
communicating with me.</i>

125
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:53,198
<i>This guy who called himself
Roosevelt gave me low-level access.</i>

126
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,465
<i>In reality, it was more of
a job, black market trading.</i>

127
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,465
<i>His prices were much lower
than market value,</i>

128
00:08:59,467 --> 00:09:02,332
<i>and this made it easy
to find buyers.</i>

129
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,165
<i>First time around, he sent me a
couple of powerful gaming laptops,</i>

130
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:07,499
<i>and I just had to sell them,</i>

131
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:10,098
<i>so I went on Craigslist
and found a buyer.</i>

132
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:13,365
<i>This guy was a small-town gamer
who liked to play for money,</i>

133
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,165
<i>but I didn't care who he was.</i>

134
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:20,165
<i>Most importantly, he had
the cash that I needed.</i>

135
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:27,165
<i>I'd never made this much money
at once.</i>

136
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,499
<i>I sent Roosevelt his cut and
bought myself a new laptop.</i>

137
00:09:30,501 --> 00:09:33,432
<i>In other words,
I was in business,</i>

138
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,998
<i>and I liked it a lot.</i>

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,565
<i>Roosevelt kept sending me
things, and I kept selling 'em</i>

140
00:09:38,567 --> 00:09:39,898
<i>and making the money
that I needed.</i>

141
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,699
<i>The products were always
something simple</i>

142
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:45,499
<i>phones, jewelry,
watches, laptops...</i>

143
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:48,132
<i>- easy to carry,</i>

144
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,765
<i>easy money.</i>

145
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,432
<i>But there were other ways
of making money, too.</i>

146
00:09:58,434 --> 00:10:01,599
<i>Forums that kept a list of
vulnerable online shopping sites,</i>

147
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:04,565
<i>and they were easy
to break into.</i>

148
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,198
<i>I didn't want
to cross that line,</i>

149
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,465
<i>but these companies
had insurance,</i>

150
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:09,298
<i>so there really
wasn't too much damage.</i>

151
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,465
<i>I pulled a few hundred credit
cards and sold them on Darkweb.</i>

152
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:21,965
<i>I would have used these cards myself,
but I needed fake I.D.S to match them,</i>

153
00:10:21,967 --> 00:10:25,132
<i>so I was happy to get
whatever I could for them.</i>

154
00:10:26,866 --> 00:10:29,698
<i>Took me four years
to save up 30 grand.</i>

155
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,931
<i>This time, I did it in four
weeks, and now I was ready.</i>

156
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,399
So I'll call you guys
when I get there.

157
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,798
Be careful.

158
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:52,565
All right.

159
00:10:52,567 --> 00:10:57,165
And I'm going to be sending
you guys money every month,

160
00:10:57,167 --> 00:11:01,232
so... spend some time together.

161
00:11:01,234 --> 00:11:03,898
Look after each other.

162
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:14,499
<i>I left my parents behind and
took the bus to the big city.</i>

163
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,865
<i>I wasn't sure if I'd made
the right decision,</i>

164
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:19,664
<i>but it was too late to go back.</i>

165
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:41,532
<i>It was pretty cool
to move to Toronto.</i>

166
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,998
<i>Everything was bigger.</i>

167
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,132
Welcome to your new home,
Mr. Sawyer.

168
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:54,798
The building has 24-hour
security, has a shared rooftop.

169
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,865
There's a loading dock
around the back.

170
00:11:56,867 --> 00:11:59,132
You've got all brand-new
stainless steel appliances,

171
00:11:59,134 --> 00:12:00,465
floor-to-ceiling windows.

172
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:02,365
The neighborhood is absolutely
up-and-coming.

173
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,965
There's not much more
you could get.

174
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:06,564
Do you have any questions?

175
00:12:06,566 --> 00:12:09,564
Yeah, how do I connect
to the Internet?

176
00:12:09,566 --> 00:12:11,731
<i>Unfortunately,
my payment was late,</i>

177
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,965
<i>and the university said I could
only start in January.</i>

178
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,132
<i>That meant I needed money
to live.</i>

179
00:12:17,999 --> 00:12:19,631
<i>I'd made enough money
for Roosevelt</i>

180
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:21,765
<i>that he increased
my access on Darkweb.</i>

181
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:23,731
<i>I could now buy credit card
numbers and fake I.D.S</i>

182
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:27,765
<i>and use 'em for online shopping.</i>

183
00:12:39,032 --> 00:12:41,965
<i>Next station
is St. George.</i>

184
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,731
- I'm expecting a package.
- Okay.

185
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,664
Yeah. Let me check it out.

186
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,631
Yeah, this should be it.

187
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:11,664
Okay.

188
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:14,865
Just sign right there.

189
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:16,831
Sure.

190
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,132
And there we go,
Mr. Munchausen.

191
00:13:19,134 --> 00:13:20,664
Thank you.

192
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:24,531
Can you take me to Chinatown?

193
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:34,965
<i>But things weren't so simple.</i>

194
00:13:36,999 --> 00:13:39,465
<i>I couldn't use Craigslist
to find buyers in the city.</i>

195
00:13:39,467 --> 00:13:42,031
<i>Too many cops and fakes,
so I tried my luck</i>

196
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:44,765
<i>with a few pawnshops
and jewelry stores.</i>

197
00:13:58,999 --> 00:14:00,698
Hey.

198
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,399
You... you speak English, yeah?

199
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:08,399
I... I have watches.

200
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:13,098
Okay?
I want to sell them.

201
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,132
Do you want to buy them?

202
00:14:16,732 --> 00:14:21,065
Look, these are real...
These are real watches, okay?

203
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:26,798
This cost... this cost $15,000.
I sell for... for ten.

204
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,698
- Thousand?
- Yes.

205
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:34,631
- W-what's that?
- No, no, no. Look, look.

206
00:14:34,633 --> 00:14:37,598
See, these are real watch,
too, okay?

207
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,865
I sell these to you
for 200 bucks.

208
00:15:12,266 --> 00:15:14,398
Ten. Ten. I got...
There's three watches.

209
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,965
- Now ten.

210
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:22,065
Hey, wait.

211
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,998
- Hey.
- What can I do for you?

212
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:48,898
Says here you purchased these three
days ago. How come you're selling 'em?

213
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,232
I... you know, I just
didn't want 'em anymore.

214
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:56,831
I can't. I lost the card that
I used to purchase 'em, so...

215
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,398
Well, wait for
a replacement card.

216
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:01,598
I mean, surely it's worth the wait
rather than losing money on the resale.

217
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,965
Look, do you want to buy them,
or do you not?

218
00:16:04,967 --> 00:16:08,664
Okay. Mr... Munchausen...

219
00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:12,431
We're going to need two pieces
of I.D. And a proof of address.

220
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:13,865
Bank statement is fine.

221
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,631
Then we're going to get you
to sign a form

222
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,531
stating that
these were not stolen,

223
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,631
at which point,
we'll review your application.

224
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,398
If everything checks out,
then you can come back,

225
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,531
and we'll make the purchase.

226
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:25,265
- You can't just buy 'em now?
- Sorry.

227
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:27,631
You know, I can drop the price,
by another thousand.

228
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:32,965
Hey, you know, don't worry about it.
I'll just... I'll keep them for now.

229
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:35,865
Sure.

230
00:16:55,665 --> 00:16:57,331
You having a rough day?

231
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,831
Sorry. Do I know you?

232
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,198
Sye.

233
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,331
Hey, I just wanted to talk
to you about your watches.

234
00:17:04,333 --> 00:17:06,232
No, no, no.

235
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,865
I'm not a cop.
I'm not a cop.

236
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:12,165
I just might want
to buy your watches.

237
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:15,965
Yeah, what do you want
to talk about?

238
00:17:15,967 --> 00:17:17,898
Look, if it'll help,

239
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,398
I'll give you five grand
for all of 'em.

240
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,831
I'm not an idiot.
Thirty grand.

241
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,065
Seven.

242
00:17:25,067 --> 00:17:26,431
Thirty grand.

243
00:17:27,532 --> 00:17:29,132
All right, tell you what.

244
00:17:29,134 --> 00:17:31,364
I go in there.

245
00:17:31,366 --> 00:17:33,031
I sell 'em for at least 30,000.

246
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:36,098
I take 30 percent off the top.

247
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:40,765
All right, but you get the money
today, huh. Otherwise...

248
00:17:40,767 --> 00:17:42,898
Otherwise, you take
your watches and go.

249
00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:47,165
Hey, look, the watches
are stolen anyway, right?

250
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:50,531
So what do you got to lose?

251
00:17:53,766 --> 00:17:56,531
- All right. Yeah.
- Yeah, all right. Let's go.

252
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:00,731
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait. Wait.

253
00:18:00,733 --> 00:18:03,765
I go in alone, all right?

254
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:17,264
Hey, Christopher!
Look who it is.

255
00:18:17,266 --> 00:18:19,664
How you doing, buddy boy?

256
00:18:49,365 --> 00:18:51,965
What the hell?

257
00:18:52,999 --> 00:18:54,398
Aw, you dick.

258
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,898
That's rude.

259
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,598
Come on.
Walk with me.

260
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,498
What happened back there?

261
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,798
What? Exactly what I said
I was going to do...

262
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,564
No, you disappeared, though.

263
00:19:07,566 --> 00:19:09,164
Yeah, I went out
the back door. Here.

264
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,297
You didn't tell me you were
going to go out the back door.

265
00:19:11,299 --> 00:19:12,965
What's this?

266
00:19:12,967 --> 00:19:16,464
$24,500 in very dirty 20s.

267
00:19:16,466 --> 00:19:19,731
Well, it would have taken a while
to get fifties and hundreds.

268
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,898
But you sold my watches
for 35,000?

269
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,765
Receipt's in the bag.

270
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:30,131
See, now you don't strike me as some student
who has very expensive taste in watches,

271
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:34,965
and you don't seem like a thief, so I'm
thinking to myself, "who is this kid?"

272
00:19:37,699 --> 00:19:40,398
How'd you do that so fast?

273
00:19:41,198 --> 00:19:42,631
I'll tell you

274
00:19:42,633 --> 00:19:45,798
if you tell me how
you got those watches.

275
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:51,698
Hey, hey, don't worry.
It's all in there.

276
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,898
I promise.

277
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:57,998
Okay.

278
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,598
Yeah.

279
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,664
<i>And that was how I met sye.</i>

280
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,498
And you want to approach
every buyer differently.

281
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,065
I know that sounds simple,
but it is important,

282
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:10,031
because you say the wrong thing,
you could lose credibility.

283
00:20:10,033 --> 00:20:12,331
You know, you could get
blacklisted real quick.

284
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,464
You don't want to do that.

285
00:20:14,466 --> 00:20:17,031
You're still working
in these conditions, eh?

286
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:18,965
I mean, it takes a lot of
strength to do what you guys do.

287
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,898
You should give yourselves
a pat on the back.

288
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,664
You guys are troopers. And you
know who else shares my opinion?

289
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:27,598
Your wives, your parents,
your sons and daughters,

290
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,798
and I think that you should
be able to call them.

291
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,264
Now, you ever use one of these?

292
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:36,331
<i>But if you can put yourself
in the shoes of the buyer,</i>

293
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:38,564
whew, you're gold.

294
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:45,998
Thank you very much.

295
00:20:47,266 --> 00:20:51,664
<i>And then there are also people, you
know, sometimes people in high places</i>

296
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:52,965
that you... you don't
think are on the market,

297
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:57,064
and they're not until you find
them something they like.

298
00:20:57,066 --> 00:21:00,965
All right, what we have for you gentlemen,
nothing short of extraordinary.

299
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:06,264
So we got monochrome
LCD display, USB interface,

300
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:09,231
20 megabytes of built-in memory.
It's got an electronic compass.

301
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:10,865
More importantly, your friends
will be really impressed

302
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:14,464
as to how you actually
got your hands on 'em, so...

303
00:21:14,466 --> 00:21:16,064
Who'd you steal from this time?

304
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,564
I know someone works
for the watch company.

305
00:21:18,566 --> 00:21:20,297
I'm getting 'em
for a good price.

306
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:21,564
How many have you got?

307
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:26,398
Two for you.
Eight for your friends.

308
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:31,097
Yeah, we'll take 'em.

309
00:21:31,099 --> 00:21:32,965
<i>Now then,
there's your longtime buyer.</i>

310
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:36,297
<i>Now, you always got
to make them happy.</i>

311
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,798
<i>You got to keep
bringing 'em stuff,</i>

312
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,931
because trust is the most important
commodity in this business, all right?

313
00:21:40,933 --> 00:21:44,798
Takes a long time to build, but
you can lose it just like that.

314
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,398
What's up?

315
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,498
- Hey, I'm Chris, by the way.
- Hi.

316
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,097
So what can I do for you?

317
00:21:52,732 --> 00:21:53,831
Boom.

318
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,531
<i>In just a couple months,
we made about 60 grand.</i>

319
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:02,831
That's your half.

320
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,798
<i>I sent some money to my parents
and saved the rest,</i>

321
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:11,931
<i>the criminal mastermind behind last
night's cyber-attack on the world bank</i>

322
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:15,997
<i>has claimed responsibility for
what he calls an act of justice.</i>

323
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:20,498
<i>But authorities say the breach
in security was substantial.</i>

324
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,364
<i>The banks of this world have
enslaved their citizens</i>

325
00:22:23,366 --> 00:22:28,398
<i>and then quietly stand back and let the people
suffer under the weight of their debts.</i>

326
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,364
<i>That is not the fault
of the people.</i>

327
00:22:30,366 --> 00:22:32,698
<i>It is the manufactured sin
of the bank.</i>

328
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,531
<i>A drug addict makes a mistake,</i>

329
00:22:34,533 --> 00:22:36,564
<i>but the drug dealer
commits the crime.</i>

330
00:22:36,566 --> 00:22:39,197
<i>Banks and bankers,
watch your backs.</i>

331
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,364
<i>Darkweb is coming after you.</i>

332
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:46,131
<i>I thought about these words</i>

333
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:49,598
<i>and realized a university life
wasn't for me.</i>

334
00:22:50,866 --> 00:22:51,964
Hey.

335
00:22:51,966 --> 00:22:54,331
If you... if you haven't
bought all your books yet,

336
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,698
these'll save you a few bucks.

337
00:22:58,766 --> 00:23:02,664
<i>So I called up sye and asked
him for help with another job.</i>

338
00:23:02,666 --> 00:23:05,364
<i>I told him I wanted
to try something bigger,</i>

339
00:23:05,366 --> 00:23:11,297
<i>forums had a blacklist of corrupt
bankers who were going to get punished,</i>

340
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:12,930
<i>but we needed to get
into their wallets,</i>

341
00:23:12,932 --> 00:23:14,997
<i>'cause their online information
was highly protected.</i>

342
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:16,865
Hey, sweetie.

343
00:23:21,065 --> 00:23:22,698
I think I got some friends
that could help.

344
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,897
<i>You know, I'm sure
it'll surprise you,</i>

345
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:27,798
<i>but the single most important
people that I get to know,</i>

346
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,431
<i>people in the service industry.</i>

347
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,698
Anybody that knows anybody,
right,

348
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,164
those are the people who are going
to help you get to the people

349
00:23:34,166 --> 00:23:38,331
that are staying there at the
hotel or at the restaurant.

350
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:41,997
These are the people
that you need to know.

351
00:23:47,132 --> 00:23:49,498
<i>Like I said, these
bankers were all corrupt.</i>

352
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:54,664
<i>Darkweb wanted to punish them, so I wanted
to pitch in to fight for the cause.</i>

353
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,464
<i>Nobody knew that I was doing
it, and that was the point.</i>

354
00:23:58,466 --> 00:24:01,131
<i>-We were anonymous.</i>

355
00:24:02,998 --> 00:24:06,930
- Just got another one. I'm going
to send it to you. -Nice.

356
00:24:06,932 --> 00:24:10,097
<i>And of course I couldn't have
done it without sye.</i>

357
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:13,664
<i>He knew a lot of people
in a lot of different places.</i>

358
00:24:18,831 --> 00:24:20,897
Hey, Chavez.
How you doing, man?

359
00:24:28,565 --> 00:24:30,164
Boys!

360
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,631
Oh, Robin, come to me,

361
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:36,498
you saucy little minx, you.

362
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,164
Mwah. Mwah.

363
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:39,431
Where have you been all my life?

364
00:24:39,433 --> 00:24:40,798
Well, you never
come around anymore.

365
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,331
Thought you started
playing for the other team.

366
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,731
Very funny.

367
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,731
Robin, this is my friend, Alex.

368
00:24:47,733 --> 00:24:50,631
Alex has never been
to a strip club before.

369
00:24:50,633 --> 00:24:52,765
You're not missing anything,
sweetie.

370
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:55,164
So remember that fat-cat banker
I was talking to you about?

371
00:24:55,166 --> 00:24:58,331
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He comes in
here all the time, so no problem.

372
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,131
I'll get one of the girls
to work him.

373
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:01,997
So, I have something else
for you.

374
00:25:01,999 --> 00:25:04,964
This guy comes in last night.
He's with a bunch of people.

375
00:25:04,966 --> 00:25:07,930
They're throwing money around.
Think he was Colombian.

376
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:11,030
Anyways, everything was fine.
The girls were making money.

377
00:25:11,032 --> 00:25:15,398
But then he tried to force himself on
one of the girls, so I stepped in.

378
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,765
Anyways, he left his card here.

379
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:19,264
None of us were so keen
on giving it back to him,

380
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,564
- so there you go.
- Hmm.

381
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:23,698
Holy shit, that's an infinity.

382
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,997
What does that mean?

383
00:25:24,999 --> 00:25:26,964
Means it's got a shitload
of money on it.

384
00:25:26,966 --> 00:25:27,731
We can use it at stores.

385
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:29,531
Knock yourselves out, boys.

386
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,231
Wait. Whoa! How much
money you want for it?

387
00:25:31,233 --> 00:25:32,864
Nothing!
It's a gift.

388
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:36,997
Just make sure you punish
that asshole.

389
00:25:36,999 --> 00:25:39,131
I love you.

390
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,464
I love her.

391
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:49,231
- No.
- What?

392
00:25:49,233 --> 00:25:51,830
We can't take money off that
card. It's too dangerous.

393
00:25:51,832 --> 00:25:53,930
What are you talking about?
I wasn't even...

394
00:25:53,932 --> 00:25:57,064
All right, look, man.
It is easy money.

395
00:25:57,066 --> 00:25:59,764
You said so yourself. It's got a
shit-ton of money on it, right?

396
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:01,498
- Yeah, but...
- So why don't we...

397
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,664
So what's $20,000, $30,000
to this guy, huh?

398
00:26:03,666 --> 00:26:05,797
So we'll just, you know,
get a fake I.D.,

399
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:10,664
put on a disguise,
go the bank, boom.

400
00:26:10,666 --> 00:26:13,997
And then we will never
touch it again.

401
00:26:13,999 --> 00:26:16,498
I promise.

402
00:26:22,765 --> 00:26:24,498
I should be the one
going in there.

403
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,930
I look way more Colombian
than you do.

404
00:26:25,932 --> 00:26:27,797
Just don't stress me out, man.
Come on.

405
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:30,097
Well, maybe you're right.
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

406
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,964
What if the guy already
reported the card stolen?

407
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,364
I'm already checking.

408
00:26:34,366 --> 00:26:37,297
What? What are you doing?

409
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,398
I'm using the card
to buy a song.

410
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,331
It only costs 99 cents,
but if it works,

411
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:42,051
that means we know
the card's still working.

412
00:26:47,632 --> 00:26:49,531
Okay, done. It works.

413
00:26:49,533 --> 00:26:52,631
All right, you sure
you want to do this?

414
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:56,431
All right, now you got to be
confident, all right?

415
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,030
Don't mess with your clothes. Just
act like you belong, all right?

416
00:26:59,032 --> 00:27:01,131
- Okay. -This rental
was really expensive.

417
00:27:01,133 --> 00:27:03,431
- You better make it worth it.
- I got it, I got it.

418
00:27:03,433 --> 00:27:05,564
All right. No pressure.

419
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,164
Go, go, go, go!
Drive! Drive!

420
00:28:05,166 --> 00:28:06,398
What happened?!
What happened?!

421
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,630
Relax. We're in the money.

422
00:28:09,632 --> 00:28:10,964

434
00:29:11,099 --> 00:29:15,663
<i>It only made me wonder what the
hell I was doing with my life.</i>

435
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:37,997
<i>And then I found something
very interesting.</i>

436
00:29:37,999 --> 00:29:41,197
<i>The bank that fired my mom and
owned the mortgage on our house</i>

437
00:29:41,199 --> 00:29:43,530
<i>ended up on the vulnerable list.</i>

438
00:29:43,532 --> 00:29:46,164
<i>I remembered my mom's tears,</i>

439
00:29:46,166 --> 00:29:49,897
<i>and I wanted to find a way
to kick them in the balls.</i>

440
00:29:49,899 --> 00:29:53,630
<i>They'd never know it's me,
but again, that was the point.</i>

441
00:29:53,632 --> 00:29:57,563
Hey, sye, you think you could
help me with a job?

442
00:30:00,598 --> 00:30:02,830
I want to cause a little chaos
in the bank,

443
00:30:02,832 --> 00:30:05,064
and I want to do something
that'll disrupt their system,

444
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:08,930
stall 'em for weeks, something
that'll make them close their doors.

445
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:12,231
Sounds good, but I don't get it.
Where are we making our money?

446
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:14,663
Oh, it's not always
about the money, sye.

447
00:30:14,665 --> 00:30:17,997
All right, this time,
it's about payback.

448
00:30:19,664 --> 00:30:20,764
What do you need me to do?

449
00:30:20,766 --> 00:30:22,663
Well...

450
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:26,630
You look good.
Confidence.

451
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:29,264
- Not too confident.
- Yep. Yep.

452
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:30,331
Remember, confidence.

453
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:34,663
<i>I'll go into the bank
and pretend to be a new client.</i>

454
00:30:34,665 --> 00:30:37,064
<i>I've already been inside,
so I know where I need to sit.</i>

455
00:30:37,066 --> 00:30:40,830
<i>Just before lunch, I'll go in as
though I'm asking for a loan.</i>

456
00:30:40,832 --> 00:30:44,530
<i>The only thing is I need
to chat up this banker girl.</i>

457
00:30:44,532 --> 00:30:46,997
<i>And that's where you come in.</i>

458
00:30:46,999 --> 00:30:49,730
Hi. Can I help you?

459
00:30:49,732 --> 00:30:52,497
- Can you do a British accent?
- Uh... probably.

460
00:30:52,499 --> 00:30:55,364
- If you can, do a British accent.
- Why?

461
00:30:55,366 --> 00:30:57,563
Chicks love it.
She'll fall for it on the spot.

462
00:30:57,565 --> 00:30:59,964
- You sure?
- Works every time, mate.

463
00:30:59,966 --> 00:31:02,597
I'd like to inquire about a
loan for a small business.

464
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,164
Oh, okay. So that would be
a commercial loan.

465
00:31:05,166 --> 00:31:07,663
- Do you have an account
with us already? -No.

466
00:31:07,665 --> 00:31:09,964
Okay, so we have a couple
of different products

467
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:13,398
I can talk to you about. So, why don't
I get some basic information from you.

468
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,697
You know what I just noticed? You have the
most beautifully symmetrical facial features.

469
00:31:16,699 --> 00:31:18,797
It's really...
You'd be great in movies.

470
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,797
- Oh. -Actually, I have
a director friend

471
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,730
<i>who would be happy to audition
you for his next film.</i>

472
00:31:25,732 --> 00:31:28,530
- Oh.
- Just crossed my mind, you know?

473
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:32,897
Okay. Can I get
your name from you?

474
00:31:32,899 --> 00:31:34,897
Yeah, sure. Yeah.

475
00:31:34,899 --> 00:31:36,897
I'm so sorry.

476
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,830
- No, that's okay. Don't worry about it.
- No, no, no.

477
00:31:44,464 --> 00:31:47,930
- Really have a lot of pens.

478
00:31:51,398 --> 00:31:53,597
- Sorry.
- That's fine.

479
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:55,030
Why don't I try
to open an account for you?

480
00:31:55,032 --> 00:31:59,797
- Sure. -Let me just,
uh, type the date in.

481
00:32:03,298 --> 00:32:05,897
Oh. That's strange.

482
00:32:05,899 --> 00:32:07,463
Oh, that's weird.

483
00:32:08,098 --> 00:32:09,463
There seems to be a problem.

484
00:32:09,465 --> 00:32:10,430
Something wrong?

485
00:32:10,432 --> 00:32:11,864
There's a problem here.

486
00:32:11,866 --> 00:32:13,430
Um...

487
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,730
That is strange.

488
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:18,497
Don't know what that's
all about.

489
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:20,264
Looks like it's lunchtime
for you, so I might...

490
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,897
I can go, and I can
come back later.

491
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,730
Yeah, that sounds
like a good idea.

492
00:32:23,732 --> 00:32:25,131
Good luck.

493
00:32:25,133 --> 00:32:26,697
Carol.

494
00:32:26,699 --> 00:32:29,297
Carol, there's something wrong.
There's...

495
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:30,897
<i>And then, once I'm done,</i>

496
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,764
<i>I'm going to quietly walk out of
the bank and head to the car,</i>

497
00:32:32,766 --> 00:32:35,530
<i>and no one will suspect a thing.</i>

498
00:32:37,365 --> 00:32:41,231
- Sir. Excuse me, sir.
- <i>-Fuck.</i>

499
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,264
Excuse me.
Can you come with us?

500
00:32:43,266 --> 00:32:44,530
What's wrong?

501
00:32:44,532 --> 00:32:45,997
We have a small security issue.

502
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:47,697
Oh, that's terrible.
What kind of security issue?

503
00:32:47,699 --> 00:32:49,377
Won't take very long.
Please, come with us.

504
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:54,563
Hey! Hey!

505
00:32:55,498 --> 00:32:57,897
Excuse me!

506
00:32:59,498 --> 00:33:01,663
Excuse me! Officer!

507
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:10,597
Alex and sye...

508
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:13,131
I appreciate your Patience.

509
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,897
I'm head of security
at this bank.

510
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:18,730
Oh, actually, sye,
you can leave. Thank you.

511
00:33:18,732 --> 00:33:21,363
I think I'm going
to stay with my friend.

512
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:23,363
Yeah, absolutely not.

513
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:25,797
Sye, it's okay.
I got this.

514
00:33:26,498 --> 00:33:28,830
Yeah, it's okay.

515
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:36,864
Um-hmm.

516
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:42,397
Ah, that's a pretty cool
little thing you got here.

517
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,797
Did you make it yourself?

518
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:45,530
I'm not saying anything
without a lawyer.

519
00:33:45,532 --> 00:33:49,764
Well, first of all, you don't have a
lawyer, and you can't afford one.

520
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:51,797
Secondly, I'm not the police,

521
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:54,064
so you can open
right up with me.

522
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,030
Did you make this yourself?

523
00:33:57,098 --> 00:33:58,397
I wrote the software.

524
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,097
Ah. Not bad for a young kid.

525
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,830
Where'd you get it?

526
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:06,231
Online.

527
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:09,164
Where online?

528
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:14,231
We're going to charge you
with breaking and entering,

529
00:34:14,232 --> 00:34:19,563
Cyberterrorism, and conspiracy to commit
credit card fraud on the federal level.

530
00:34:19,565 --> 00:34:22,097
You're looking at five to ten
years in prison,

531
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:27,897
and you will not be allowed to touch another
computer again for the rest of your life.

532
00:34:29,564 --> 00:34:35,064
I mean, of course unless you want to
tell me where you... you bought this.

533
00:34:39,364 --> 00:34:43,630
Fine. Then I will
call the police.

534
00:34:45,132 --> 00:34:46,997
Hey, sir, can I ask your name?

535
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:48,797
Curtis. Yeah.

536
00:34:48,799 --> 00:34:52,363
Is that your... is that your
first or your last name?

537
00:34:52,365 --> 00:34:53,997
Both.

538
00:34:53,999 --> 00:34:56,030
Okay, Mr. Curtis,
can you...

539
00:34:56,032 --> 00:34:58,764
Can put the phone down
for a second, please?

540
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:03,230
You have exactly one minute.

541
00:35:03,232 --> 00:35:06,430
Look, this was just a prank, okay?
I wasn't trying to...

542
00:35:06,432 --> 00:35:08,230
I wasn't trying
to steal anything.

543
00:35:08,232 --> 00:35:10,363
Your security system is awful.

544
00:35:10,365 --> 00:35:12,230
Firewall's outdated.

545
00:35:12,232 --> 00:35:13,630
The software that I created

546
00:35:13,632 --> 00:35:16,530
was able to put a virus
in the system very easily.

547
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:18,397
I mean, it doesn't look good
for you if an 18-year-old

548
00:35:18,399 --> 00:35:21,030
was able to break in to the bank
and steal all this information.

549
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:23,830
I mean, bank like this
should be more secure.

550
00:35:23,832 --> 00:35:26,597
Okay.

551
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,697
Okay, what... what I'm
suggesting is, uh,

552
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,697
you let me upgrade
the software for free.

553
00:35:37,699 --> 00:35:41,830
You can tell everyone that, you
know, that you had a security test

554
00:35:41,832 --> 00:35:43,730
and you brought me in
to fix the problem.

555
00:35:43,732 --> 00:35:46,697
Bank'll look bulletproof, your
bosses will be thanking you,

556
00:35:46,699 --> 00:35:51,830
and in exchange, all I ask is that you let
my friend and I just walk out of here,

557
00:35:51,832 --> 00:35:54,864
and we can all pretend like
none of this ever happened.

558
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:59,930
Does that seem... fair?

559
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:05,663
What the hell happened in there? Why'd
they let you go? What'd you tell 'em?

560
00:36:05,665 --> 00:36:07,563
I told them I wouldn't do it
again. They let me go.

561
00:36:07,565 --> 00:36:09,296
Wait. That's all you said?

562
00:36:09,298 --> 00:36:10,930
Yeah. Thought you'd be happy.

563
00:36:10,932 --> 00:36:13,463
Just seems a little bit
too easy. That's all.

564
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:17,064
<i>I wanted to punish
this bank, and I failed.</i>

565
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:21,030
<i>But some people
didn't see it that way.</i>

566
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:23,864
<i>Someone leaked information
on Darkweb,</i>

567
00:36:23,866 --> 00:36:26,930
<i>and everyone knew it was me.</i>

568
00:36:30,765 --> 00:36:32,730
<i>At first, I was worried
that I'd get in trouble,</i>

569
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:36,130
<i>but apparently people
were impressed.</i>

570
00:36:37,564 --> 00:36:39,363
<i>Even the head
of Darkweb noticed.</i>

571
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:42,196
No way. Sye. Sye.
Sye, wake up, man.

572
00:36:42,198 --> 00:36:43,430
Hey.

573
00:36:43,432 --> 00:36:44,830
Look at this.
I just got a like from zed.

574
00:36:44,832 --> 00:36:45,930
You like who?

575
00:36:45,932 --> 00:36:47,697
No, no, zed,
the guy I told you about.

576
00:36:47,699 --> 00:36:49,163
He just sent me a like.
Look at that.

577
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:52,530
I'm happy for you.

578
00:36:55,164 --> 00:36:58,463
<i>I'd never gotten this
kind of attention before.</i>

579
00:36:58,465 --> 00:37:00,263
<i>Apparently, what I did
was pretty ballsy,</i>

580
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:01,597
<i>'cause I actually went
into the bank,</i>

581
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,263
<i>whereas most break-ins
happen remotely.</i>

582
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:06,930
<i>That's why he noticed me.</i>

583
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:14,030
Dude, you're famous.

584
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:17,630
Huh? What...
Hey, what are you doing, man?

585
00:37:17,632 --> 00:37:22,296
I just got you... a date.

586
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:24,597
What the hell?

587
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,397
What? She wants to
meet up with you.

588
00:37:26,399 --> 00:37:27,764
She said she's got some ideas

589
00:37:27,766 --> 00:37:29,363
on how you guys can work
together. Cute, right?

590
00:37:29,365 --> 00:37:32,096
What, you set me up on, like,
a date with a random stranger?

591
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:33,497
I mean, we got to lay low, man.

592
00:37:33,499 --> 00:37:35,563
No, you need to get laid.

593
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:38,296
I mean come on.

594
00:37:38,298 --> 00:37:40,597
What's the worst
that could happen?

595
00:37:43,431 --> 00:37:45,363
So you're Kira, huh?

596
00:37:45,365 --> 00:37:47,663
Yeah, but it's not my real name.

597
00:37:47,665 --> 00:37:49,930
Where are you from?

598
00:37:49,932 --> 00:37:52,029
I don't give out
my personal information.

599
00:37:52,031 --> 00:37:55,363
Okay. Then what are we
supposed to talk about?

600
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:57,029
Where are you from?

601
00:37:57,031 --> 00:37:58,463
I'm from London.

602
00:37:58,465 --> 00:37:59,897
I don't hear an accent.

603
00:37:59,899 --> 00:38:01,530
London, Ontario.

604
00:38:01,532 --> 00:38:03,764
Really? That sucks.

605
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:06,830
Thank you. Thanks.

606
00:38:06,832 --> 00:38:09,764
Um... so when's
your birthday?

607
00:38:09,766 --> 00:38:12,964
It's the 23rd of June, 1993.

608
00:38:12,966 --> 00:38:15,263
See? You're an idiot.

609
00:38:15,265 --> 00:38:16,630
Excuse me?

610
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:19,764
I know your name, where you're
from, and your birth date.

611
00:38:19,766 --> 00:38:22,864
With that information, I could steal
your identity and ruin your life.

612
00:38:22,866 --> 00:38:25,363
It'd be a shame for someone
like you to go down like that.

613
00:38:25,365 --> 00:38:27,230
Someone like me?

614
00:38:27,232 --> 00:38:32,029
I mean, you might as well tell me what your
mother's maiden name is or her occupation.

615
00:38:32,031 --> 00:38:33,930
She doesn't have one.

616
00:38:35,398 --> 00:38:37,330
- That's rough.
- Yeah, but she's...

617
00:38:37,332 --> 00:38:40,697
She's tied to our house with,
you know, mortgage by the bank

618
00:38:40,699 --> 00:38:42,630
that fired her little while ago,

619
00:38:42,632 --> 00:38:45,029
and they know she couldn't even
afford it if she had the job.

620
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:49,163
They say the drug addict makes the mistake,
but the drug dealer commits the crime.

621
00:38:49,165 --> 00:38:52,163
Did you just quote zed?

622
00:38:52,165 --> 00:38:55,463
Yeah, I did.
Do you follow him?

623
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:58,697
Well, yeah, doesn't everybody?

624
00:38:58,699 --> 00:39:02,130
No. Most people are in it
for the money.

625
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,830
Huh.

626
00:39:06,331 --> 00:39:10,063
So, have you met him?

627
00:39:10,065 --> 00:39:12,597
Um, I almost met him.

628
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,463
"Almost"?
What does that mean?

629
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:17,130
If you want to meet zed,

630
00:39:17,132 --> 00:39:19,363
you have to do something big.

631
00:39:21,098 --> 00:39:22,797
Are you going to answer that?

632
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:24,730
Yeah. Sorry.

633
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:27,263
Yeah.

634
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:28,363
Are you banging her yet?

635
00:39:28,365 --> 00:39:30,063
I...

636
00:39:30,065 --> 00:39:31,230
No, hey, I'm just kidding.

637
00:39:31,232 --> 00:39:32,996
I'm just kidding. Just kidding.

638
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,263
<i>Listen. I've got an idea.</i>

639
00:39:34,265 --> 00:39:36,063
Uh-huh. Okay, what is it?

640
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:39,063
What if we ask if she wants
to work with us?

641
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:41,096
Okay.

642
00:39:41,098 --> 00:39:44,963
No, you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, we just met her.

643
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:47,330
<i>I mean, all that shit she was
writing me on the computer</i>

644
00:39:47,332 --> 00:39:49,764
about credit card printers
and Bitcoins.

645
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:51,963
I mean, no offense, but she
knows more than you do,

646
00:39:51,965 --> 00:39:54,096
<i>and if we're going
to keep growing, get bigger,</i>

647
00:39:54,098 --> 00:39:57,196
girl can always help. I mean,
alone, we're just two dudes,

648
00:39:57,198 --> 00:40:01,230
but she can be a girlfriend,
a distraction, a decoy.

649
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,597
<i>Look, listen.
You trust me, right?</i>

650
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:06,896
Just ask her if she wants
to work with us.

651
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:10,397
All right. Yeah.

652
00:40:10,399 --> 00:40:12,196
I'll call you back, all right?

653
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:13,363
Hey, hey, ask her.

654
00:40:13,365 --> 00:40:18,797
- So...
- I was thinking...

655
00:40:18,799 --> 00:40:20,830
All right, you go.

656
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:27,330
I mean, I was just wondering if you
were working with anybody right now.

657
00:40:27,332 --> 00:40:33,963
That's funny, because I was going to
ask if you wanted to work together.

658
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,530
Ah.

659
00:40:35,532 --> 00:40:37,764
<i>We got pretty
carried away with Kira.</i>

660
00:40:37,766 --> 00:40:39,863
<i>First thing she did was make us
buy a credit card printer.</i>

661
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:42,896
I have a couple thousand blank
cards I picked up in Thailand.

662
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,730
We can stamp them in here and
sell them on the Darkweb,

663
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,830
or we can use them in stores,

664
00:40:46,832 --> 00:40:50,697
and this is how we can get
credit card information.

665
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:52,597
<i>We used our old crew
to get the credit card numbers,</i>

666
00:40:52,599 --> 00:40:55,096
<i>and we'd print the duplicates,
hide them in magazines,</i>

667
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:58,163
<i>and ship them to buyers
all around the world.</i>

668
00:41:00,197 --> 00:41:02,630
<i>Then she got us using Bitcoins.</i>

669
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:05,730
<i>This was digital currency that
was pretty much untraceable,</i>

670
00:41:05,732 --> 00:41:08,764
<i>and people used it to pay us
for the credit cards.</i>

671
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,929
<i>Then she introduced me
to onion browsing.</i>

672
00:41:10,931 --> 00:41:14,430
<i>Apparently, you could buy an atom bomb
on there, and no one could trace it.</i>

673
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:18,663
Address. I can type it in
again here.

674
00:41:18,665 --> 00:41:22,497
<i>And then she proved to be
useful in a very practical way.</i>

675
00:41:23,331 --> 00:41:24,996
Like it, sweetie?

676
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:25,697
Uh-hmm.

677
00:41:25,699 --> 00:41:28,029
We'll take it. Thank you.

678
00:41:53,398 --> 00:41:54,963
<i>Kira basically upgraded us.</i>

679
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:57,096
<i>She managed to find targets
with much bigger wallets.</i>

680
00:41:57,098 --> 00:41:59,929
<i>That's how we were able to
afford big, expensive toys.</i>

681
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:03,497
<i>We went from online carding
to real carding.</i>

682
00:42:03,499 --> 00:42:05,963
Why do you keep taking
the pictures?

683
00:42:05,965 --> 00:42:07,363
My clients need to know
what I'm selling.

684
00:42:07,365 --> 00:42:09,863
Having fun? Great.

685
00:42:09,865 --> 00:42:12,029
When do I get to buy something?

686
00:42:12,031 --> 00:42:15,697
Finding right car is like
finding the right woman.

687
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:19,029
You want to get inside her
several times a day,

688
00:42:19,031 --> 00:42:22,163
show her off to your friends,
but never let them touch her.

689
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:24,330
- Then you've come to the right place.
- Ah.

690
00:42:24,332 --> 00:42:27,597
It just all depends how much you
want to spend on the wedding.

691
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:31,397
Oh, depends. What kind of girl?

692
00:42:33,131 --> 00:42:35,196
Italian.

693
00:42:35,198 --> 00:42:37,863
Ah.

694
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:43,430
You like her, boss?

695
00:42:43,432 --> 00:42:46,130
Never been kissed.

696
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:09,096
<i>When it came time to sell,
Kira was surprisingly good.</i>

697
00:43:09,098 --> 00:43:11,497
Wow.

698
00:43:11,499 --> 00:43:12,863
I sold the watches.

699
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:14,363
That's great.

700
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:16,263
Why didn't you let us know?

701
00:43:16,265 --> 00:43:17,497
Just wanted to take
some initiative.

702
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:19,630
That's awesome.
That is awesome.

703
00:43:19,632 --> 00:43:22,796
Oh, and I found someone
to buy the diamond ring.

704
00:43:22,798 --> 00:43:28,029
<i>She used a social media site called Mobli
to advertise our products to her buyers.</i>

705
00:43:28,031 --> 00:43:30,096
<i>We were very impressed.</i>

706
00:43:30,098 --> 00:43:32,196
<i>But we suspected she was
working with someone.</i>

707
00:43:32,198 --> 00:43:35,363
<i>Of course sye wasn't very happy
about this new arrangement.</i>

708
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,729
<i>After all, he usually did
all the selling.</i>

709
00:43:37,731 --> 00:43:40,130
Where do you find these guys?

710
00:43:40,132 --> 00:43:43,230
My uncle helped me. I usually
give him a piece of my cut.

711
00:43:43,232 --> 00:43:48,063
Then we're going to have to meet him
if he's going to be working with us.

712
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:52,696
Well, he really just works with me,
so we don't have to include him.

713
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:54,063
As long as that's okay
with you guys.

714
00:43:54,065 --> 00:43:57,397
Shouldn't be a problem.
You don't mind, right, sye?

715
00:43:57,399 --> 00:44:01,996
I don't, Alex.
I don't mind at all.

716
00:44:17,964 --> 00:44:19,263
You all right, man?

717
00:44:19,265 --> 00:44:21,130
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

718
00:44:21,132 --> 00:44:24,896
It seems like something's
bugging you.

719
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:31,430
Look, if you don't want to work
with her, we don't have to.

720
00:44:31,432 --> 00:44:33,296
I don't know.

721
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:37,696
Just seems like she has all these
buyers that don't even haggle with her.

722
00:44:37,698 --> 00:44:40,929
I mean, how the fuck does
she know these people?

723
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:44,363
- She fucking 'em?
- Or her uncle's helping her.

724
00:44:44,365 --> 00:44:46,896
Okay. Then why does
she need us, huh?

725
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:49,696
She seems to be doing
just fine on her own.

726
00:44:49,698 --> 00:44:52,130
My gut's telling me
something's up here.

727
00:44:52,132 --> 00:44:57,063
Maybe your gut's gotten a little jealous
'cause she can do what you can do.

728
00:44:59,098 --> 00:45:00,463
You're joking, right?

729
00:45:00,465 --> 00:45:02,263
I don't know. I mean, it
just seems like

730
00:45:02,265 --> 00:45:05,929
you're a little off
on this one, you know?

731
00:45:12,697 --> 00:45:15,696
Hoo! And they gave me
a ten percent tip.

732
00:45:15,698 --> 00:45:19,196
Why? What,
you give 'em a tug?

733
00:45:19,198 --> 00:45:20,929
Dude, don't be like that.

734
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:39,562
I think we should move
to Hong Kong.

735
00:45:39,564 --> 00:45:41,596
Why? What's in Hong Kong?

736
00:45:41,598 --> 00:45:46,996
Well, remember I told you there's
a lot of action happening there.

737
00:45:46,998 --> 00:45:49,863
I think you and I could do
really well there if we tried.

738
00:45:49,865 --> 00:45:51,863
Seriously.

739
00:45:51,865 --> 00:45:55,463
Hong Kong is the place to be
for people like us right now.

740
00:45:55,465 --> 00:45:58,230
Sye could keep running
some deals here,

741
00:45:58,232 --> 00:46:01,029
but you and I should go.

742
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:05,163
If only for a little while.

743
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:08,263
I can't just get up and go,
especially without sye.

744
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,996
He's like my best friend.

745
00:46:09,998 --> 00:46:12,163
Can't just leave him here.

746
00:46:17,331 --> 00:46:19,629
Well, think about it.

747
00:46:28,497 --> 00:46:31,397
- Hey. -This better be
fucking important.

748
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,829
Roosevelt.

749
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:36,463
It's nice to...
Nice to finally meet you.

750
00:46:36,465 --> 00:46:38,662
Make it fast, kid.
I don't have all day.

751
00:46:38,664 --> 00:46:40,330
Yeah. You know,
I just wanted to...

752
00:46:40,332 --> 00:46:42,596
I wanted to say
thank you and, uh...

753
00:46:42,598 --> 00:46:45,729
You know, meet you
in person, obviously.

754
00:46:45,731 --> 00:46:48,063
That's what you asked me
out here for?

755
00:46:48,065 --> 00:46:52,929
Well, you know, it's...
I think it's important...

756
00:46:53,964 --> 00:46:56,430
Okay, well, you know,
you brought me in.

757
00:46:56,432 --> 00:47:00,196
You, you know,
here you gave me a shot.

758
00:47:00,198 --> 00:47:02,363
That's my token of gratitude.

759
00:47:02,365 --> 00:47:04,462
How much is it?

760
00:47:04,464 --> 00:47:05,896
It's five grand.

761
00:47:05,898 --> 00:47:09,729
Pretty nice of you.

762
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:11,462
But I heard that you been...

763
00:47:11,464 --> 00:47:14,397
Can I get a fucking
coffee here?!

764
00:47:17,131 --> 00:47:20,696
I hear you been going
to the stores. Why?

765
00:47:22,164 --> 00:47:24,662
Well, I can make
more money that way.

766
00:47:29,164 --> 00:47:32,130
Oh, that tastes like shit.

767
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:35,462
And I wanted to find out if you
knew about a girl named Kira.

768
00:47:35,464 --> 00:47:38,763
Yeah, she's a lieutenant.

769
00:47:38,765 --> 00:47:40,662
No, i... no, I never heard of her.
Why? Do you want to fuck her?

770
00:47:40,664 --> 00:47:42,429
No. No, no, no.

771
00:47:42,431 --> 00:47:44,196
I just... I was curious.

772
00:47:44,198 --> 00:47:47,562
Well, if I haven't heard of her,
then she's probably no good.

773
00:47:47,564 --> 00:47:51,397
Anyway, I think we're done here.

774
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:53,996
Well, no. Do you know
how I can meet zed?

775
00:47:57,431 --> 00:47:59,896
You know zed?

776
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,063
You a cop?

777
00:48:02,065 --> 00:48:03,662
No, of course I'm not a cop.

778
00:48:03,664 --> 00:48:06,629
Don't ask stupid
fucking questions.

779
00:48:11,864 --> 00:48:14,029
This is a fucking stupid idea.

780
00:48:14,031 --> 00:48:15,429
You need to relax, pal.

781
00:48:15,431 --> 00:48:18,963
Who the fuck are you to tell me
to relax? And I'm not your pal.

782
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:20,829
Jesus. You've been
with us a few weeks,

783
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,763
and you think you can
tell us what to do?

784
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:24,029
I'm not telling you what to do.

785
00:48:24,031 --> 00:48:26,029
I'm just saying if
we don't do this right,

786
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:28,230
it's going to take forever
to get rid of all this stuff.

787
00:48:28,232 --> 00:48:29,596
I think it's pretty logical.

788
00:48:29,598 --> 00:48:32,562
No, no, no, no, no.
What's logical is to stay small,

789
00:48:32,564 --> 00:48:34,096
keep pushing smaller loads,

790
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:37,562
and then when it's time, grow
bigger and push larger ones.

791
00:48:37,564 --> 00:48:41,096
That's exactly what we're doing.
We're growing, so keep up.

792
00:48:41,098 --> 00:48:43,763
Alex, you better step in, or I
am gonna tip this truck over,

793
00:48:43,765 --> 00:48:48,396
and she's gonna kill herself when she hits the
ground and I fall on her face with my ass!

794
00:48:53,897 --> 00:48:55,829
You know, you need
to calm down, okay?

795
00:48:55,831 --> 00:48:57,296
Oh, are you fucking
serious right now?

796
00:48:57,298 --> 00:48:58,696
You're making everybody tense.

797
00:48:58,698 --> 00:49:00,496
You're fucking supposed
to be tense.

798
00:49:00,498 --> 00:49:04,896
Look, it's a dumb idea
walking into this meeting.

799
00:49:04,898 --> 00:49:06,196
How do you know?

800
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:07,330
'Cause they're buying
a shitload,

801
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:08,763
and unlike miss fancy-pants,

802
00:49:08,765 --> 00:49:10,429
we don't know
who the fuck they are.

803
00:49:10,431 --> 00:49:12,629
Why does that matter,
though? They're buying.

804
00:49:12,631 --> 00:49:14,096
It matters because...

805
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:18,696
Ah, god. Jesus, Alex.
You're not thinking. All right?

806
00:49:18,698 --> 00:49:20,796
Look, we got a good thing
going here, man.

807
00:49:20,798 --> 00:49:22,196
I don't want to screw it up.

808
00:49:22,198 --> 00:49:23,929
All right, I been watching her.

809
00:49:23,931 --> 00:49:25,729
Something's not right.
I can't put my finger on it.

810
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:27,863
It's on me, okay,
'cause I brought her in,

811
00:49:27,865 --> 00:49:32,696
but I'm telling you that fucking girl
is putting us under too much risk.

812
00:49:32,698 --> 00:49:35,096
We'll go in. We'll
evaluate the situation.

813
00:49:35,098 --> 00:49:39,863
If we can't, it won't matter because we
can just sell them all individually.

814
00:49:39,865 --> 00:49:41,996
Huh?

815
00:49:41,998 --> 00:49:44,963
- It's not...
- Alex!

816
00:49:53,597 --> 00:49:57,496
Everything looks good.
We'd be happy to make a deal.

817
00:49:57,498 --> 00:49:59,433
Well, of course I
share your opinion.

818
00:49:59,458 --> 00:50:01,929
It looks good, and I would
love to make a deal.

819
00:50:01,931 --> 00:50:07,763
But I'd like to know,
what's your real commitment?

820
00:50:07,765 --> 00:50:11,230
Honestly, how many of these things
do you want to buy today, hmm?

821
00:50:11,232 --> 00:50:13,462
A few? Half? How many?

822
00:50:13,464 --> 00:50:16,996
'Cause our principle of business
is based on trust,

823
00:50:16,998 --> 00:50:19,662
because without trust,
you can't have business.

824
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:21,929
And, of course,
I want to become trustworthy,

825
00:50:21,931 --> 00:50:24,929
so I don't want you to feel like
you got to buy everything today.

826
00:50:24,931 --> 00:50:28,596
You know, you're welcome to just take a
few pieces and then come back for more.

827
00:50:28,598 --> 00:50:32,362
Actually, no.
My partner's mistaken.

828
00:50:32,364 --> 00:50:34,262
There is no negotiating here.

829
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,829
Either you buy everything
in that truck,

830
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:39,396
or we walk and find
another buyer.

831
00:50:39,398 --> 00:50:40,662
That's our deal.

832
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:42,662
- Take it, or leave it.
- What the fuck are you doing?

833
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,996
I'm selling, because clearly you're
not man enough to do it yourself.

834
00:50:45,998 --> 00:50:48,796
This is the biggest deal we've ever had.
I'm not gonna let you ruin this.

835
00:50:48,798 --> 00:50:52,130
Why don't you just back off and
let the adults deal with this?

836
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:55,796
Because you're about to ruin this deal
with that fat little mouth of yours.

837
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:57,529
What makes you feel like
you can talk to me like that?

838
00:50:57,531 --> 00:51:00,696
I'm protecting my interests. My money paid
for the stuff just as much as yours did.

839
00:51:00,698 --> 00:51:02,396
Where do you find these guys?

840
00:51:02,398 --> 00:51:05,863
Not a single one of them seems to know
who you are, so where'd you find 'em?

841
00:51:05,865 --> 00:51:07,130
Sye, it's her uncle, all right?
It's fine.

842
00:51:07,132 --> 00:51:09,396
- Just let her handle it.
- Oh, god, this fucking uncle.

843
00:51:09,398 --> 00:51:11,295
What are you, taking her side?
No, hey, hey, hey.

844
00:51:11,297 --> 00:51:14,863
She brings in these sketchy-ass buyers
who, as far as we know, might be cops.

845
00:51:14,865 --> 00:51:17,696
- The buyers are not cops.
- How the fuck do you know, huh?!

846
00:51:17,698 --> 00:51:19,763
God, you're always so
fucking sure of yourself.

847
00:51:19,765 --> 00:51:21,562
You need to calm the fuck down.

848
00:51:21,564 --> 00:51:23,629
All you ever do is talk!

849
00:51:23,631 --> 00:51:25,529
Yeah, I'll talk all I want to,
sweetheart,

850
00:51:25,531 --> 00:51:27,996
'cause I been doing this
a lot longer than you have.

851
00:51:27,998 --> 00:51:29,362
Okay, why don't we
just make a deal, guys?

852
00:51:29,364 --> 00:51:31,963
No, there's not gonna be a deal
with this fucking girl here!

853
00:51:31,965 --> 00:51:34,729
- Is there a problem here?
- No. There's no problem...

854
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:37,429
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

855
00:51:37,431 --> 00:51:39,396
Okay, look, we don't want
any trouble, okay?

856
00:51:39,398 --> 00:51:40,763
So let's just make the deal.

857
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,130
No deal.

858
00:51:42,132 --> 00:51:44,163
Okay, that's fine.

859
00:51:44,165 --> 00:51:45,096
All right.
All right. We'll go.

860
00:51:45,098 --> 00:51:47,229
Stop being pussies.

861
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:48,963
We are making this deal
right now.

862
00:51:48,965 --> 00:51:51,130
You are gonna buy
everything in that truck...

863
00:51:54,363 --> 00:51:58,562
All right, sye, Kira, I need you to
just shut the fuck up right now, okay?

864
00:51:58,564 --> 00:52:01,362
It's fine. No deal.
You walk. We'll walk.

865
00:52:01,364 --> 00:52:03,496
We can make a deal another time,
okay?

866
00:52:03,498 --> 00:52:05,329
Deal is off the table
for good now.

867
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:10,462
If we ever see you again, if you
deal with anyone that we know,

868
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:12,462
we will not be as pleasant
as we were today.

869
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:14,929
Let's go.

870
00:52:22,897 --> 00:52:24,130
That was pleasant?

871
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,863
- Good job, sye.
- Fuck off!

872
00:52:28,865 --> 00:52:31,829
You have to be
so up in his face?

873
00:52:31,831 --> 00:52:35,130
These are my contacts.
You guys are ruining all of my contacts.

874
00:52:35,131 --> 00:52:37,662
What a waste of my time.

875
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:43,896
Fuck!

876
00:52:55,997 --> 00:52:58,029
That was a fucking mess.

877
00:52:59,296 --> 00:53:00,696
You guys either need
to get along,

878
00:53:00,698 --> 00:53:02,295
or we all go our separate ways,

879
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:03,396
'cause I don't want to get shot,

880
00:53:03,398 --> 00:53:05,496
and I'm pretty sure
you guys don't either.

881
00:53:05,498 --> 00:53:09,063
So, sye, you got to relax.

882
00:53:09,065 --> 00:53:10,929
I mean, if she thinks
she can handle something,

883
00:53:10,931 --> 00:53:13,262
you got to give her
a chance, man.

884
00:53:13,264 --> 00:53:15,662
Sorry.

885
00:53:15,664 --> 00:53:17,496
Yeah, whatever.

886
00:53:17,498 --> 00:53:19,462
Sye.

887
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:23,496
Fine. I'm sorry.

888
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:34,796
There's cops at our truck.

889
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:47,596
We got to get out of here.

890
00:54:08,296 --> 00:54:10,796
That was really close.

891
00:54:12,296 --> 00:54:13,963
Why'd he just leave like that?

892
00:54:13,965 --> 00:54:15,896
Who cares? He's gone.

893
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:18,596
Okay, guys, I been thinking
about what happened today,

894
00:54:18,598 --> 00:54:21,996
and I think it's a sign
for us to move somewhere else.

895
00:54:23,463 --> 00:54:25,596
He's right.

896
00:54:25,598 --> 00:54:27,429
Those buyers could
actually come after us.

897
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,095
They're all mobbed up.

898
00:54:29,097 --> 00:54:30,896
All mobbed up?

899
00:54:30,898 --> 00:54:32,863
You hooked us up
with mobbed-up buyers?

900
00:54:32,865 --> 00:54:38,562
That doesn't matter anymore, because
we're going to get out of the city.

901
00:54:42,597 --> 00:54:46,796
Okay, then where are we
going to go?

902
00:54:48,597 --> 00:54:50,929
How 'bout Hong Kong?

903
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:33,329
<i>So Hong Kong
became our new home.</i>

904
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:35,329
<i>We'd made a ton of money,</i>

905
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,129
<i>so we decided to enjoy it
a little bit.</i>

906
00:55:55,029 --> 00:55:56,562
This is nice.

907
00:55:56,564 --> 00:55:57,629
Yeah, it's beautiful.

908
00:55:57,631 --> 00:56:00,129
Eh, it's all right.

909
00:56:00,131 --> 00:56:01,596
Seriously?

910
00:56:01,598 --> 00:56:03,928
What? It's a fucking
hotel room.

911
00:56:04,663 --> 00:56:07,863
Going to go find the minibar.

912
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,396
<i>We also got ourselves
a brand-new car</i>

913
00:56:10,398 --> 00:56:11,696
<i>and a quiet place
where we could work.</i>

914
00:56:11,698 --> 00:56:16,995
<i>Here we kept all of our gear
and our money.</i>

915
00:56:36,463 --> 00:56:38,162
<i>And after everything
that happened,</i>

916
00:56:38,164 --> 00:56:41,662
<i>we hoped that things would calm
down and we'd move up in the world.</i>

917
00:56:41,664 --> 00:56:44,429
<i>At least,
I had hoped they would.</i>

918
00:56:44,431 --> 00:56:46,229
Thank you.

919
00:56:46,231 --> 00:56:48,763
<i>Me Gusta.</i>

920
00:56:57,363 --> 00:56:59,362
<i>Here, our volumes got bigger.</i>

921
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:00,696
<i>We bought more,</i>

922
00:57:00,698 --> 00:57:03,162
<i>we sold more,
and for higher prices.</i>

923
00:57:03,164 --> 00:57:06,962
<i>But it was all the same shit,
watches, jewelry, computers, phones.</i>

924
00:57:06,964 --> 00:57:09,962
<i>It didn't feel like we were
doing anything special.</i>

925
00:57:18,363 --> 00:57:20,195
I like them.

926
00:57:20,197 --> 00:57:22,729
We'll take it.

927
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:23,696
All of them.

928
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:25,396
Great. Thank you.

929
00:57:34,063 --> 00:57:38,362
I want you to appreciate the quality of
the product that I'm bringing to you.

930
00:57:38,364 --> 00:57:41,928
How much, all?

931
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:44,629
Two hundred.

932
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,529
For you.

933
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,462
<i>It felt like we were
just making money.</i>

934
00:58:06,464 --> 00:58:08,195
<i>We had no purpose.
We weren't moving forward.</i>

935
00:58:08,197 --> 00:58:09,828
Please have her sign here.

936
00:58:09,830 --> 00:58:13,295
<i>We even started getting sloppy.</i>

937
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:14,662
<i>Anytime we used the card,</i>

938
00:58:14,664 --> 00:58:16,696
<i>we always did
a test purchase online</i>

939
00:58:16,698 --> 00:58:18,763
<i>to make sure the card
wasn't blocked,</i>

940
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:20,429
<i>but we had hundreds
of credit cards,</i>

941
00:58:20,431 --> 00:58:22,429
<i>and it was hard
to keep track of them,</i>

942
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:24,729
<i>so we got ourselves a pick-up.</i>

943
00:58:25,996 --> 00:58:28,195
I'm... sorry, sir.

944
00:58:30,598 --> 00:58:32,629
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

945
00:58:37,663 --> 00:58:39,662
<i>A pick-up was when
a card would get canceled,</i>

946
00:58:39,664 --> 00:58:41,995
<i>and if a duplicate was used,
the terminal would recognize</i>

947
00:58:41,997 --> 00:58:43,928
<i>that it's a fake
and would warn the cashier</i>

948
00:58:43,930 --> 00:58:46,662
<i>to hold the card
and call the cops.</i>

949
00:58:46,664 --> 00:58:50,429
<i>We took that risk whenever
we didn't test the card.</i>

950
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:58,295
<i>Like I said, we were just
making money, a lot of it,</i>

951
00:58:58,297 --> 00:59:01,596
<i>and the trouble with that is
money doesn't change people.</i>

952
00:59:01,598 --> 00:59:03,696
<i>It reveals them.</i>

953
00:59:03,698 --> 00:59:08,729
<i>And I got to see a side of sye
that I'd never seen before.</i>

954
00:59:08,731 --> 00:59:11,762
Jeez, would you quit
with the computer already?

955
00:59:11,764 --> 00:59:14,629
We still get buyers off Mobli.

956
00:59:22,397 --> 00:59:24,329
I feel like we're not
getting anywhere.

957
00:59:24,331 --> 00:59:27,529
We're doing the exact same shit
we were doing in Toronto.

958
00:59:27,531 --> 00:59:29,728
It's getting kind of boring,
don't you think?

959
00:59:29,730 --> 00:59:32,696
It's not like we're sending anyone
a message or hurting the system.

960
00:59:32,698 --> 00:59:34,562
We're just making money.

961
00:59:34,564 --> 00:59:36,828
So what do you want to do?

962
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,762
I don't know. We just got to...
We got to step our game up.

963
00:59:39,764 --> 00:59:42,028
We got to do something that's
big, something that'll hurt.

964
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:44,895
Well, zed prides himself
on being a visionary.

965
00:59:44,897 --> 00:59:47,262
He knows that to send
a message to the system,

966
00:59:47,264 --> 00:59:52,229
you have to talk in terms of dollars
and cents, because money is power.

967
00:59:52,231 --> 00:59:56,429
If we can figure out a way
to make money and cause chaos,

968
00:59:56,431 --> 00:59:58,262
we can finally get
his attention.

969
00:59:58,264 --> 01:00:00,928
Okay, so how do we do it?

970
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:03,496
- What if we try...

971
01:00:03,498 --> 01:00:06,662
Guys, we should be celebrating!

972
01:00:06,664 --> 01:00:10,129
Celebrating what, failure?

973
01:00:10,963 --> 01:00:12,728
It's my birthday.

974
01:00:14,996 --> 01:00:15,995
Ah.

975
01:00:40,096 --> 01:00:41,728
So what do you think?

976
01:00:41,730 --> 01:00:45,562
I can't believe we forgot
his birthday.

977
01:00:45,564 --> 01:00:48,195
We gotta get him something.

978
01:00:48,197 --> 01:00:51,928
No, Alex,
I was talking about the ATM's.

979
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:55,162
That's my girl, not yours.

980
01:00:55,164 --> 01:00:57,362
She doesn't want to be with you.

981
01:00:57,364 --> 01:00:59,995
I paid for her the whole night.

982
01:00:59,997 --> 01:01:03,262
I paid her three times as much,
so fuck off!

983
01:01:03,264 --> 01:01:05,095
You can't afford her anymore.

984
01:01:05,097 --> 01:01:06,895
Oh, shit.

985
01:01:07,996 --> 01:01:10,028
Excuse me. One side.

986
01:01:12,996 --> 01:01:15,928
Sye!

987
01:01:25,230 --> 01:01:27,728
Calm down, buddy!
Calm down! Calm down!

988
01:01:38,397 --> 01:01:39,628
Shut the fuck up!

989
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:54,828
I'm sorry, man.

990
01:01:59,130 --> 01:02:00,728
Hey.

991
01:02:02,296 --> 01:02:04,962
Look, I know.
I fucked up.

992
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:08,862
Okay.

993
01:02:10,096 --> 01:02:12,062
I get it.

994
01:02:14,530 --> 01:02:16,062
Andrew Smith.

995
01:02:16,064 --> 01:02:17,862
Eric Dupere.

996
01:02:17,864 --> 01:02:20,462
Come out.

997
01:02:35,796 --> 01:02:37,795
What happened?
What's going on?

998
01:02:37,797 --> 01:02:40,062
My uncle.

999
01:03:04,829 --> 01:03:06,262
Where's sye?

1000
01:03:06,264 --> 01:03:08,828
I don't know. He was
gone when I woke up.

1001
01:03:10,562 --> 01:03:14,396
Listen, I think I have what
we've been looking for.

1002
01:03:14,398 --> 01:03:16,195
Yeah, what's that?

1003
01:03:16,197 --> 01:03:18,728
- ATM's.
- What do you mean, "ATM's"?

1004
01:03:18,730 --> 01:03:21,728
So, banks keep physical cash
in vaults,

1005
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:24,528
safety-deposit boxes,
and ATM's.

1006
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:26,995
- Okay. -Wire fraud gets
covered by insurance,

1007
01:03:26,997 --> 01:03:32,129
but if we knock a physical location, then
it's a question of security and reputation,

1008
01:03:32,131 --> 01:03:37,229
that's amazing. Why have we been wasting
our time with all the other shit?

1009
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:44,795
Check it. Check it.
Check it.

1010
01:03:47,896 --> 01:03:49,528
You like?

1011
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:51,129
How did you get that?

1012
01:03:51,131 --> 01:03:53,828
I did what I'm good at. I bought
some things. I sold some things.

1013
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,928
Don't say I don't got it
anymore. I still got it.

1014
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:00,828
And it's also an apology
for yesterday.

1015
01:04:03,430 --> 01:04:06,129
- That's a nice job, man.
- Yeah, way to go.

1016
01:04:06,131 --> 01:04:11,429
Oh, and for old times' sake,
look what card I used.

1017
01:04:13,462 --> 01:04:18,195
- You fucking serious, sye?
- What?

1018
01:04:18,197 --> 01:04:21,928
You went out, used this fucking
card? Are you out of your mind?

1019
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,795
What's your problem?

1020
01:04:23,797 --> 01:04:25,728
Well, for one, where's your
fucking disguise, sye?

1021
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,129
Don't worry about it.
It's not a big deal.

1022
01:04:27,131 --> 01:04:29,862
- I wore my sunglasses.
- Sunglasses. That's great.

1023
01:04:29,864 --> 01:04:33,661
The problem is that we took
money from this card, sye!

1024
01:04:33,663 --> 01:04:36,129
You can't just go out and use it
without a fucking disguise!

1025
01:04:36,131 --> 01:04:37,795
Do you not know
they can find us?!

1026
01:04:37,797 --> 01:04:40,628
Jesus, I was just
trying to help.

1027
01:04:40,630 --> 01:04:42,995
Just like you helped yesterday,
got us thrown in jail, huh?

1028
01:04:42,997 --> 01:04:45,195
I already told you I was sorry.
What more do you want from me?

1029
01:04:45,197 --> 01:04:48,528
Nothing. I don't want anything
from you anymore. You know why?

1030
01:04:48,530 --> 01:04:50,395
'Cause you been acting
like a dick lately.

1031
01:04:50,397 --> 01:04:51,728
You've been fucking
everything up.

1032
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:53,561
You don't trust Kira.
You're drunk all the time.

1033
01:04:53,563 --> 01:04:54,795
And now you've gone
and used the fucking card

1034
01:04:54,797 --> 01:04:58,229
that I specifically told you
not to use again, sye!

1035
01:04:58,231 --> 01:05:01,262
I think you should just go.

1036
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:02,329
Just go back to Toronto, huh?

1037
01:05:02,331 --> 01:05:06,628
Is this coming from her?
Did she tell you to say this?

1038
01:05:06,630 --> 01:05:08,428
She didn't say shit.
This is me, sye.

1039
01:05:08,430 --> 01:05:09,895
This is me asking you to leave.

1040
01:05:09,897 --> 01:05:11,728
'Cause while you're here, we're
gonna get fucking locked up

1041
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,995
or we're gonna fucking die!

1042
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:17,895
So you should just...
Just take your cut and go, huh.

1043
01:05:23,396 --> 01:05:24,695
Okay.

1044
01:05:26,063 --> 01:05:27,895
I'll pack my bags.

1045
01:05:58,696 --> 01:06:00,962
I left my ids in the drawer.
Good luck with everything.

1046
01:06:03,296 --> 01:06:06,762
You know, this used to be fun.

1047
01:06:21,396 --> 01:06:24,528
Oh, fuck.

1048
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:28,928
What the fuck did I just do?
What the fuck did I just do?

1049
01:06:30,263 --> 01:06:31,995
Oh, shit.

1050
01:07:25,063 --> 01:07:27,695
234 Tak man street.

1051
01:07:39,996 --> 01:07:44,528
<i>Now let's try the ATM...
18 Kierna Waiden road.</i>

1052
01:07:45,996 --> 01:07:51,595
5052 ma hang road. It's busy,
but you can take a lot.

1053
01:08:12,029 --> 01:08:14,695
That's the last one.

1054
01:08:14,697 --> 01:08:16,595
I'm out.

1055
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:24,661
<i>$2.3 million was stolen across
various ATM's in Hong Kong.</i>

1056
01:08:24,663 --> 01:08:27,895
<i>Authorities are at a loss, as
no one knows how this happened,</i>

1057
01:08:27,897 --> 01:08:32,461
<i>but we do have confirmation that a
notorious cybercriminal organization</i>

1058
01:08:32,463 --> 01:08:34,294
<i>has claimed responsibility.</i>

1059

<i>Darkweb, the online mafia</i>

1060

fugitive zed,</i>

1061

<i>Was committed by Darkweb,

responsible for the citizens...</i>

1064

To causing a little chaos.

1065

<i>World banks now fear for
the safety of their assets.</i>

1066
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:58,395
So we should probably pack up
and get out of here tomorrow.

1067
01:08:58,397 --> 01:09:00,862
Whole city'll be looking for us.

1068
01:09:00,864 --> 01:09:01,962
Yeah.

1069
01:09:01,964 --> 01:09:04,962
Everything okay?

1070
01:09:04,964 --> 01:09:07,161
Yeah, I'm fine.

1071
01:09:07,163 --> 01:09:10,728
Hey, come on. Look at me.
What's on your mind?

1072
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:15,595
I want to get out.

1073
01:09:15,597 --> 01:09:18,461
That's what we're doing.
We're leaving.

1074
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:23,428
No, I mean I don't want
to do this anymore.

1075
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:25,428
I want to disappear.

1076
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:27,161
Disappear? Where?

1077
01:09:27,163 --> 01:09:29,528
Anywhere. Let's just go.

1078
01:09:29,530 --> 01:09:30,962
With this money,
if we invest it,

1079
01:09:30,964 --> 01:09:33,895
we don't have to worry about
anything ever again.

1080
01:09:33,897 --> 01:09:36,294
Are you fucking serious
right now?

1081
01:09:36,296 --> 01:09:39,095
Don't swear at me.

1082
01:09:39,996 --> 01:09:42,294
Okay, look, I'm sorry,

1083
01:09:42,296 --> 01:09:44,628
but that's fucking stupid,
all right?

1084
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:47,228
You just want... you want to
leave all this behind

1085
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:48,695
and go live a boring
old life, huh?

1086
01:09:48,697 --> 01:09:51,294
Would it really be that boring
if it was just the two of us?

1087
01:09:51,296 --> 01:09:52,561
Yes. What the fuck
would we do?

1088
01:09:52,563 --> 01:09:54,495
We would relax, enjoy life.

1089
01:09:54,497 --> 01:09:55,661
But for how long?
Are you Cr...

1090
01:09:55,663 --> 01:09:56,928
I mean, you're the one who said

1091
01:09:56,930 --> 01:09:58,695
we got to cause chaos
and make some money.

1092
01:09:58,697 --> 01:10:02,895
Yeah, well, now that we've done that, I
think maybe we should relax for a minute.

1093
01:10:02,897 --> 01:10:05,261
Fuck that. Why do you want
to leave? What's changed?

1094
01:10:05,263 --> 01:10:12,261
I had a different plan for my life,
and now it's just different.

1095
01:10:12,263 --> 01:10:14,094
Okay, well, you know,
I appreciate that,

1096
01:10:14,096 --> 01:10:16,928
but i...
I can't just drop this.

1097
01:10:16,930 --> 01:10:21,495
I mean, my parents almost lost everything
'cause of those fucking banks.

1098
01:10:21,497 --> 01:10:22,728
I'm going to punish all of them.

1099
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:25,261
Those fuckers don't deserve
to sit in their chairs

1100
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:28,461
and rip people off every...

1101
01:10:44,997 --> 01:10:48,094
Oh, my god. It's zed.

1102
01:11:28,195 --> 01:11:30,161
It's done.

1103
01:11:30,163 --> 01:11:33,161
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into.

1104
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:36,862
Okay. I don't...
I don't fucking understand you.

1105
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:40,027
You're the one who said we
needed to get zed's attention.

1106
01:11:49,629 --> 01:11:51,862
Yeah, I'm in Hong Kong.

1107
01:11:53,129 --> 01:11:55,128
Yeah, there's two of us.

1108
01:11:56,329 --> 01:11:57,728
Yeah.

1109
01:12:01,329 --> 01:12:02,928
<i>Kira's plan had worked.</i>

1110
01:12:02,930 --> 01:12:05,395
<i>Zed noticed us
and arranged a meeting</i>

1111
01:12:05,397 --> 01:12:06,994
<i>off the island of Hong Kong.</i>

1112
01:12:06,996 --> 01:12:10,461
<i>But the man behind the Darkweb
mask was very different</i>

1113
01:12:10,463 --> 01:12:12,795
<i>to what I'd imagined in my head.</i>

1114
01:12:14,596 --> 01:12:16,595
Get out of the car.
Leave your stuff.

1115
01:12:16,597 --> 01:12:18,862
He's going to search you.

1116
01:12:55,429 --> 01:12:58,927
So what brings you to Hong Kong?

1117
01:12:58,929 --> 01:13:01,228
Well, we...

1118
01:13:01,230 --> 01:13:03,862
We almost got caught in Toronto.

1119
01:13:03,864 --> 01:13:06,762
We got tired of that, so Kira
suggested we move here.

1120
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:13,695
Why would you suggest that?

1121
01:13:16,028 --> 01:13:19,661
Because Hong Kong is the place
to be for people like us.

1122
01:13:20,928 --> 01:13:23,294
Also we heard that maybe
you'd be out here, too.

1123
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:25,428
We wanted to meet you.

1124
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:30,061
You wanted to meet me?

1125
01:13:30,063 --> 01:13:33,561
What made you think that you
would even get my attention?

1126
01:13:33,563 --> 01:13:36,261
We had a plan that could
bring in a lot of money.

1127
01:13:36,263 --> 01:13:39,762
Oh. Well, I don't care
about money,

1128
01:13:39,764 --> 01:13:43,294
but I understand
that many people do.

1129
01:13:43,296 --> 01:13:46,595
So, why do you need me?

1130
01:13:46,597 --> 01:13:49,261
Oh, we need a lot of resources.

1131
01:13:49,263 --> 01:13:51,695
The plan wouldn't work
without you.

1132
01:13:51,697 --> 01:13:53,795
Okay.

1133
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:59,894
Then after you tell me,
why do I need you?

1134
01:13:59,896 --> 01:14:02,628
'Cause we know how
to get this job done.

1135
01:14:02,630 --> 01:14:05,661
I would have people
to do that for me,

1136
01:14:05,663 --> 01:14:08,828
hmm, more than likely
even better.

1137
01:14:08,830 --> 01:14:12,595
Well, sir, I believe you
to be a man of principle,

1138
01:14:12,597 --> 01:14:15,261
so if I bring you an idea
and you like it,

1139
01:14:15,263 --> 01:14:18,661
I can only hope that you'll let
me see it through to the end.

1140
01:14:21,562 --> 01:14:25,795
Well, before you tell me what
you're about to tell me...

1141
01:14:25,797 --> 01:14:30,228
I need you to understand
who I am.

1142
01:14:30,230 --> 01:14:33,094
I am not your friend.

1143
01:14:33,096 --> 01:14:35,927
I'm not your boss.

1144
01:14:35,929 --> 01:14:38,561
I am your owner.

1145
01:14:38,563 --> 01:14:42,294
If you work for me,
you'll become my property,

1146
01:14:42,296 --> 01:14:45,461
and if you do your job right,

1147
01:14:45,463 --> 01:14:48,595
you could have
anything you want.

1148
01:14:49,562 --> 01:14:52,961
But if you make a mistake,

1149
01:14:52,963 --> 01:14:55,561
you will die.

1150
01:14:56,928 --> 01:15:02,961
And so will your families and
so will all your friends.

1151
01:15:04,295 --> 01:15:05,927
So, if you want to hold the ax,

1152
01:15:05,929 --> 01:15:11,595
you make sure to cut off
the head clean.

1153
01:15:12,496 --> 01:15:15,061
Because with me,

1154
01:15:15,063 --> 01:15:18,561
there won't be any mistakes.

1155
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:28,595
So why didn't you say
anything in there, huh?

1156
01:15:28,597 --> 01:15:31,428
There's no limit
to what he can do.

1157
01:15:32,562 --> 01:15:34,395
What the hell?

1158
01:15:37,729 --> 01:15:39,261
Got a missed call from sye.

1159
01:15:39,263 --> 01:15:40,761
<i>Hey, Alex, it's me.</i>

1160
01:15:40,763 --> 01:15:42,961
<i>I'm just...
I'm really sorry about the...</i>

1161
01:15:42,963 --> 01:15:44,927
<i>The way that things went down,
and I just...</i>

1162
01:15:44,929 --> 01:15:47,261
<i>I been thinking a lot,
and I just really want a chance</i>

1163
01:15:47,263 --> 01:15:48,927
<i>to make it up to you and Kira,</i>

1164
01:15:48,929 --> 01:15:51,761
<i>just go back to the way
that things were.</i>

1165
01:15:51,763 --> 01:15:54,261
So, I came back to the hotel,
and I'm here right now,

1166
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:58,361
and I'm just going to wait for
you till you get back, so...

1167
01:15:59,829 --> 01:16:02,861
Oh, maybe that's you right now.

1168
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,761
What... just wait.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

1169
01:16:12,162 --> 01:16:13,794
He's at the hotel.

1170
01:16:13,796 --> 01:16:15,161
Really?

1171
01:16:15,163 --> 01:16:16,861
Yeah.

1172
01:16:16,863 --> 01:16:20,561
Sounds like he's feeling better.
Maybe we should go talk to him.

1173
01:16:20,563 --> 01:16:22,661
Maybe we should.

1174
01:16:36,895 --> 01:16:39,094
Sye?

1175
01:16:41,295 --> 01:16:43,395
Sye.

1176
01:16:52,429 --> 01:16:55,727
Sye! S...

1177
01:16:58,129 --> 01:16:59,395
Fuck!

1178
01:17:01,229 --> 01:17:02,528
Fuck!

1179

<i>I'm gonna call
the cops. I'll call the cops.</i>

1180
01:17:08,896 --> 01:17:10,894
<i>Alex, you cannot call the cops.</i>

1181
01:17:10,896 --> 01:17:12,660
- I'll call the ambulance. They
can do something! -Alex...

1182
01:17:12,662 --> 01:17:14,994
- No, they can't, Alex.
- They'll come and help him!

1183
01:17:14,996 --> 01:17:16,727
- There's no helping him!
- We can't leave him, Kira!

1184
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:18,495
- There's no helping him right now, Alex.
- Fuck you!

1185
01:17:18,497 --> 01:17:20,595
- I'm gonna call the ambulance!
- Give me the phone!

1186
01:17:20,597 --> 01:17:22,428
- Fuck you!
- Give me the phone.

1187
01:17:22,430 --> 01:17:24,827
<i>Ow! Stop!</i>

1188
01:17:24,829 --> 01:17:28,361
<i>Stop! Get out...
We have to get out of here!</i>

1189
01:17:28,363 --> 01:17:31,027
<i>Stop! Please!</i>

1190

to yourself,</i>

1199
01:18:20,763 --> 01:18:26,361
"I will still get
this fucking job done."

1200
01:18:26,363 --> 01:18:30,061
I'm still going to get
this fucking job done.

1201
01:18:30,962 --> 01:18:32,694
Listen, I think
after all this is done,

1202
01:18:32,696 --> 01:18:34,294
we should find
a place to hide out.

1203
01:18:34,296 --> 01:18:36,627
Yeah, I agree.
We should go back to Toronto.

1204
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:40,861
No. We need to go
as far away as possible.

1205
01:18:40,863 --> 01:18:43,827
I have an idea as to where
we should meet.

I'm sure, Mr. Dimayo.</i>

1217
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:29,361
<i>Sir, each of these stock options
might not cost a lot right now,</i>

1218
01:19:29,363 --> 01:19:33,495
<i>but they're going to expire in half
an hour, and they will be worthless.</i>

1219
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:35,328
<i>You see, by opening up
these positions,</i>

1220
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:38,994
<i>you're betting that the market
is essentially going to crash.</i>

1221
01:19:38,996 --> 01:19:41,660
<i>I just want you to understand
that, you know, my job...</i>

1222
01:19:41,662 --> 01:19:44,727
Your job is to do
exactly as I tell you,

1223
01:19:44,729 --> 01:19:48,927
and if I tell you to open,
you will fucking open.

1224
01:19:48,929 --> 01:19:52,627
<i>They'll be up on your screen
once we fill the orders.</i>

1225
01:20:02,028 --> 01:20:04,461
- I can't do this.
- No, no, no, no.

1226
01:20:04,463 --> 01:20:07,827
Look, look.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1227
01:20:07,829 --> 01:20:12,560
What are these kids doing?
Get back to your seats.

1228
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:14,094
I think we should walk away.

1229
01:20:14,096 --> 01:20:15,627
What are you talking about?

1230
01:20:15,629 --> 01:20:18,660
Things are not right here.
It's going to go badly.

1231
01:20:20,795 --> 01:20:22,194
Guys.

1232
01:20:22,196 --> 01:20:24,194
It's not going to go well.

1233
01:20:24,196 --> 01:20:26,228
They're almost there, guys.

1234
01:20:26,230 --> 01:20:27,494
I need you here, okay?

1235
01:20:27,496 --> 01:20:29,428
No, Alex, you don't
need me here.

1236
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:30,428
You can do this yourself.

1237
01:20:30,430 --> 01:20:32,961
Okay, fine, fine.
I want you here.

1238
01:20:32,963 --> 01:20:34,328
They're pulling up
to the building.

1239
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:38,294
All right, look, I don't want
to do this without you.

1240
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:40,194
Okay, after this, we can go.

1241
01:20:40,196 --> 01:20:43,228
We can do whatever you want to do, but
now I really would like you here.

1242
01:20:43,230 --> 01:20:44,560
It's not that simple.

1243
01:20:44,562 --> 01:20:46,094
Kira, please, come on.

1244
01:20:47,762 --> 01:20:50,395
Guys, we really need you
here right now.

1245
01:21:02,229 --> 01:21:05,061
Guys, here we go.

1246
01:21:20,928 --> 01:21:24,027
Sir, sir, can you comment
on the current market situation?

1247
01:21:24,029 --> 01:21:26,761
Can we be expecting any
market corrections, perhaps?

1248
01:21:26,763 --> 01:21:27,761
No comment.

1249
01:21:27,763 --> 01:21:31,961
- For bringing the market
back onto its feet...

1250
01:21:34,330 --> 01:21:36,261
Fuck, yeah!

1251
01:21:42,330 --> 01:21:44,161
Are they ready?

1252
01:21:44,163 --> 01:21:46,460
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Begin.

1253
01:22:03,628 --> 01:22:05,394
<i>We're just getting
a breaking news alert.</i>

1254
01:22:05,396 --> 01:22:07,128
<i>We have some live breaking news.</i>

1255
01:22:07,130 --> 01:22:08,360
<i>We have a shot for you.</i>

1256
01:22:08,362 --> 01:22:12,128
<i>There's been an incident with the
chairman of the federal reserve.</i>

1257
01:22:12,130 --> 01:22:16,061
<i>Tragic situation, and of course
this is affecting the state</i>

1258
01:22:16,063 --> 01:22:19,394
<i>and the entire country
as we wait with bated breath.</i>

1259
01:22:19,396 --> 01:22:21,594
<i>No confirmation on
if he has been killed.</i>

1260
01:22:21,596 --> 01:22:23,761
<i>He was rushed to hospital.</i>

1261
01:22:23,763 --> 01:22:27,527
The chairman of the federal
reserve has just been shot

1262
01:22:27,529 --> 01:22:28,927
outside the federal reserve
building.

1263
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:31,660
We have no idea where...

1264
01:22:44,995 --> 01:22:50,261
<i>We have a report that the chairman of
the federal reserve has been shot.</i>

1265
01:22:50,263 --> 01:22:54,294
<i>It is unconfirmed whether
or not he has been killed.</i>

1266
01:22:54,296 --> 01:22:56,961
Is this thing
actually happening?

1267
01:22:56,963 --> 01:22:58,560
Good god.

1268
01:22:58,562 --> 01:23:00,560
Well, of course, yes.
Unload everything.

1269
01:23:00,562 --> 01:23:03,527
Yes, everything!
Just do it!

1270
01:23:05,828 --> 01:23:07,061
Bloody yanks.

1271
01:23:32,428 --> 01:23:33,827
<i>Sir, from the looks of it,</i>

1272
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:35,994
<i>there will probably be
an investigation.</i>

1273
01:23:35,996 --> 01:23:37,727
Pull the positions.

1274
01:23:37,729 --> 01:23:40,761
Send the rest of the money
to these accounts.

1275
01:23:40,763 --> 01:23:44,627
Twenty percent to Alex, and the
rest you can divide up equally.

1276
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:47,161
<i>Sir, maybe we should wait until
Monday so that the sec...</i>

1277
01:23:47,163 --> 01:23:52,660
Just do it. Remember, oz,
money doesn't change anybody.

1278
01:23:52,662 --> 01:23:54,894
It only reveals them.

1279
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:58,627
Let's see what our friend
does with his money.

1280
01:24:06,195 --> 01:24:10,260
- Need to get out of here.
- Yeah. Just one more second.

1281
01:24:10,262 --> 01:24:13,961
That's for sye, asshole.

1282
01:24:15,495 --> 01:24:19,594
Is what? Hold on. Sir!

1283
01:24:19,596 --> 01:24:21,827
News says you've been killed.

1284
01:24:22,928 --> 01:24:24,161
Hello.

1285
01:24:25,828 --> 01:24:27,961
What the hell are you
talking about?

1286
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:30,594
How can I be dead
if I'm talking to you?

1287
01:24:30,596 --> 01:24:33,027
<i>And that's the closing bell.</i>

1288
01:24:33,029 --> 01:24:37,161
<i>After today's tragic incident,
the market witnessed a nosedive,</i>

1289
01:24:37,163 --> 01:24:40,527
<i>and by the looks of it,
the sec has ordered a stop</i>

1290
01:24:40,529 --> 01:24:43,527
<i>on all trading accounts
until further notice.</i>

1291
01:24:43,529 --> 01:24:45,794
<i>It's unclear what this means
for the economy,</i>

1292
01:24:45,796 --> 01:24:48,560
<i>but we can expect the fallout
to last for a while.</i>

1293
01:24:56,561 --> 01:24:59,061
- Hey, Alex. Time's up.
- What's going on?

1294
01:24:59,063 --> 01:25:02,660
No. Alex!
You bastards! Alex!

1295
01:25:07,162 --> 01:25:09,394
Where is Kira?
What have you done with her?

1296
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:13,527
Hey, fuck you!
Fuck you!

1297
01:25:14,895 --> 01:25:17,394
Where is Kira?

1298
01:25:19,062 --> 01:25:21,219
We're just going to sit here?
Is that what's happening?

1299
01:25:27,261 --> 01:25:29,061
Yeah.

1300
01:25:31,129 --> 01:25:32,994
Yeah.

1301
01:25:33,695 --> 01:25:34,360
Let's go.

1302
01:25:34,362 --> 01:25:36,627
Who was that?

1303
01:25:36,629 --> 01:25:40,394
That your mom?
You inviting her to the party?

1304
01:25:40,396 --> 01:25:42,460
Quiet.

1305
01:25:44,228 --> 01:25:47,094
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
What the fuck?!

1306
01:26:45,895 --> 01:26:49,694
Uh... JFK as fast
as possible, please.

1307
01:26:53,595 --> 01:26:55,794
I need to use your phone,
please.

1308
01:27:01,996 --> 01:27:05,027
<i>The number you have called
is not assigned.</i>

1309
01:27:05,029 --> 01:27:07,994
<i>Both Kira's and zed's
phones were disconnected.</i>

1310
01:27:07,996 --> 01:27:10,527
<i>How was that possible?
Who set us up?</i>

1311
01:27:10,529 --> 01:27:13,494
<i>Who were those guys that
kidnapped me, zed's people?</i>

1312
01:27:13,496 --> 01:27:16,660
<i>I didn't know,
and I didn't know what to do.</i>

1313
01:27:16,662 --> 01:27:20,827
<i>I had to go and meet Kira in the one place
where she said no one would ever find us.</i>

1314
01:27:30,561 --> 01:27:34,494
<i>Here, I felt cut off
from the rest of the world.</i>

1315
01:27:35,128 --> 01:27:36,293
<i>I was alone,</i>

1316
01:27:36,295 --> 01:27:39,727
<i>and everything
was stacked against me.</i>

1317
01:27:39,729 --> 01:27:42,093
<i>Kira and I agreed that
if anything happened,</i>

1318
01:27:42,095 --> 01:27:46,927
<i>we'd meet at noon at the temple of
dawn two days after the operation.</i>

1319
01:27:47,628 --> 01:27:49,627
<i>So I had to wait.</i>

1320
01:27:49,629 --> 01:27:54,494
<i>And in that moment,
I remembered my parents.</i>

1321
01:27:54,496 --> 01:27:57,861
<i>I had completely
forgotten about them.</i>

1322
01:28:05,762 --> 01:28:10,026
<i>We are unavailable to take your call.
Please leave a message.</i>

1323
01:28:10,028 --> 01:28:13,026
Hey, mom, dad.

1324
01:28:13,028 --> 01:28:15,127
It's me, Alex.

1325
01:28:15,129 --> 01:28:17,594
I'm sorry I haven't called.

1326
01:28:17,596 --> 01:28:20,527
I'm sorry I kind of disappeared.

1327
01:28:21,994 --> 01:28:26,060
I'm going to be home
in a few days. I promise.

1328
01:28:26,062 --> 01:28:28,694
Yeah, I miss you.

1329
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:32,494
<i>Okay, bye.</i>

1330
01:28:34,528 --> 01:28:37,761
Alex. Alex!

1331
01:28:46,561 --> 01:28:49,227
- Cell phone. Hey, guy.
- Yeah?

1332
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:50,293
- Phone?
- Oh, yeah.

1333
01:28:50,295 --> 01:28:53,427
- Yes, BlackBerry.
- No, cheaper.

1334
01:28:53,429 --> 01:28:54,761
- Something cheaper.
- Cheap?

1335
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:58,260
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- It's cheap. 1,000 baht.

1336
01:28:58,262 --> 01:28:59,927
- Half. 500 baht.
- No.

1337
01:28:59,929 --> 01:29:01,627
- No?
- 600 baht.

1338
01:29:01,629 --> 01:29:04,293
- Okay. 600.
- Yeah.

1339
01:29:04,295 --> 01:29:05,560
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1340
01:29:05,562 --> 01:29:07,060
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1341
01:29:07,062 --> 01:29:08,427
Thank you.

1342
01:29:20,628 --> 01:29:22,560
Can I have a single, please?

1343
01:29:22,562 --> 01:29:24,494
Can I have your passport,
please?

1344
01:29:24,496 --> 01:29:26,894
Yeah, yeah.
Do you have Internet?

1345
01:29:26,896 --> 01:29:29,427
- The Internet doesn't work.
- No? Okay.

1346
01:29:29,429 --> 01:29:33,560
- Your key.
- Thank you. Thanks.

1347
01:30:01,261 --> 01:30:03,993
<i>I waited and waited for her,</i>

1348
01:30:03,995 --> 01:30:06,594
<i>but she never showed up.</i>

1349

<i>Now I really felt alone again.</i>

<i>No friends, no family, no one.</i>

1351

Excuse me.
What time is it?

1352
01:30:24,729 --> 01:30:25,993
- Sorry?
- What time is it?

1353
01:30:25,995 --> 01:30:29,193
Oh. Uh... 12:15.

1354
01:30:29,195 --> 01:30:31,127
Thank you. Thanks.

1355
01:30:49,061 --> 01:30:51,394
Excuse me.
What time is it?

1356
01:30:51,396 --> 01:30:52,527
Uh, ten-to-three.

1357
01:30:52,529 --> 01:30:54,960
Okay. Thank you.

1358

Hi. I need to

1363
01:31:20,496 --> 01:31:21,893
Okay. You pay first.

1364
01:31:21,895 --> 01:31:25,960
Yeah. Yeah.
You take card, right?

1365
01:31:25,962 --> 01:31:29,427
You go there, number five.
On the left.

01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:33,560
Yeah, left.

1368
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:09,193
<i>Days after the staged account on the
chairman of the federal reserve,</i>

1369
01:32:09,195 --> 01:32:11,727
<i>the stock markets are finally
up and running again.</i>

1370
01:32:11,729 --> 01:32:15,026
<i>The authorities apprehended those
responsible for the attack.</i>

1371
01:32:15,028 --> 01:32:18,826
<i>The notorious computer hacker
zed has been taken into custody</i>

1372
01:32:18,828 --> 01:32:22,460
<i>and will be charged with over
five dozen counts of wire fraud,</i>

1373
01:32:22,462 --> 01:32:27,160
<i>as well as charges of insider
trading, tax evasion, and terrorism.</i>

1374
01:32:27,162 --> 01:32:32,560
<i>The authorities have also shed light on
zed's partner in crime, Kira Whittal.</i>

1375
01:32:32,562 --> 01:32:34,960
<i>Now, she's been with zed's
outfit from the very start.</i>

1376
01:32:34,962 --> 01:32:38,860
<i>She was shot dead while attempting
to flee from federal agents.</i>

1377
01:32:38,862 --> 01:32:42,694
<i>Police were compelled to use deadly
force when Whittal opened fire.</i>

1378
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:45,327
<i>How was that possible?</i>

1379
01:32:45,329 --> 01:32:49,460
<i>And finally, a third conspirator
was arrested this morning.</i>

1380
01:32:49,462 --> 01:32:52,327
<i>A Colombian businessman known
as Alfonso Regalo</i>

1381
01:32:52,329 --> 01:32:56,127
<i>was apprehended when it was found that
his money financed the operation.</i>

1382
01:32:56,129 --> 01:32:59,260
<i>No, she couldn't be dead. She must
have left a clue for me on her page.</i>

1383
01:32:59,262 --> 01:33:01,160
Mobli. Okay.

1384
01:33:09,261 --> 01:33:12,026
Excuse me.

1385
01:33:12,028 --> 01:33:15,427
I'm not connected.
Can you reconnect me, please?

1386
01:33:15,429 --> 01:33:17,193
- Can you connect...
- Hey, you.

1387
01:33:17,195 --> 01:33:20,093
Your passport. You.

1388
01:33:20,095 --> 01:33:22,093
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1389
01:33:22,095 --> 01:33:25,726
- Five minutes.
Five more minutes.

1390
01:33:25,728 --> 01:33:28,260
No, no, it's very important.
Just go and press the button.

1391
01:33:28,262 --> 01:33:30,960
- No! -Five minutes. What's "five
minutes" in Thai? Please.

1392
01:33:30,962 --> 01:33:33,394
- Please come with us.
- I just need to talk to...

1393
01:33:33,396 --> 01:33:35,260
- I just need to talk
to somebody.

1394
01:33:35,262 --> 01:33:38,160
No, no, no. Please, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

1395
01:33:38,162 --> 01:33:39,693
Somebody...
I need five minutes.

1396
01:33:39,695 --> 01:33:41,026
Five minutes. Five...

1397
01:33:41,028 --> 01:33:42,394
I need to talk to somebody!

1398
01:33:42,396 --> 01:33:44,160
I just need five
fucking minutes!

1399
01:33:44,162 --> 01:33:46,127
Can you please
give me five minutes?!

1400
01:33:55,994 --> 01:33:57,826
No, no, no, no, no.
Listen. Just listen.

1401
01:33:57,828 --> 01:33:59,560
If you'd just hear me out.

1402
01:33:59,562 --> 01:34:00,793
Please. Come on.
You understand English?

1403
01:34:00,795 --> 01:34:02,327
Can you stop for a second,
please?

1404
01:34:02,329 --> 01:34:06,627
I just need five minutes.
Can you come back, please?

1405
01:34:06,629 --> 01:34:09,926
I just need five minutes
on the Internet! I...

1406
01:34:21,362 --> 01:34:25,527
<i>I'd hoped that Kira was still
alive and that she'd find me.</i>

1407
01:34:25,529 --> 01:34:29,926
<i>With every day that went by,
I lost hope.</i>

1408
01:34:34,695 --> 01:34:37,993
I've been asking for a while
now, and I really...

1409
01:34:37,995 --> 01:34:42,460
I wouldn't mind... I really wouldn't mind
if I could just have... just five minutes.

1410
01:34:42,462 --> 01:34:45,193
Five minutes is...
Is not a very long time!

1411
01:34:45,195 --> 01:34:49,360
Five minutes on the Internet!
How fucking hard can it be?!

1412
01:34:49,362 --> 01:34:51,026
How many times
do I have to ask?!

1413
01:34:51,028 --> 01:34:54,260
I can fucking hear you!
I can hear you walking around!

1414
01:34:54,262 --> 01:34:55,826
Can you at least say something?!

1415
01:34:55,828 --> 01:34:59,893
Just say, "no"! Tell me no,
but don't fucking say nothing!

1416
01:35:08,261 --> 01:35:10,527
Hey!

1417
01:35:15,894 --> 01:35:18,227
<i>- And then...</i>
- Help me.

1418
01:35:18,229 --> 01:35:20,460
<i>I resigned myself to it.</i>

1419
01:35:20,462 --> 01:35:24,760
<i>I accepted the fact
that I was alone.</i>

1420
01:35:26,395 --> 01:35:29,960
<i>My parents,
sye, Darkweb, Kira, zed,</i>

1421
01:35:29,962 --> 01:35:33,160
<i>it was all so far away
and so long ago.</i>

1422
01:35:33,162 --> 01:35:37,160
<i>Back then, I wanted to change
the world for the better,</i>

1423
01:35:37,162 --> 01:35:39,860
<i>but now my world was dead.</i>

1424
01:35:39,862 --> 01:35:44,026
<i>So I decided to just
give up on life.</i>

1425
01:35:49,694 --> 01:35:52,427
<i>But life wasn't ready
to give up on me.</i>

1426
01:36:03,294 --> 01:36:06,960
<i>I decided to stop living in the
past and just decided to live.</i>

1427
01:36:06,962 --> 01:36:10,993
<i>Even if I lived like a caged
animal, I was still alive.</i>

1428
01:36:12,194 --> 01:36:15,360
<i>I realized that by the time
I was 21 years old,</i>

1429
01:36:15,362 --> 01:36:17,659
<i>I'd caused a lot of harm
to a lot of people,</i>

1430
01:36:17,661 --> 01:36:22,494
<i>that I was responsible for the
death of the people I loved.</i>

1431
01:36:24,027 --> 01:36:25,726
<i>Everything had changed,</i>

1432
01:36:25,728 --> 01:36:29,893
<i>all the chaos,
the conspiracies, my beliefs.</i>

1433
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:34,860
<i>It was all different.</i>

1434
01:36:37,395 --> 01:36:40,526
<i>But I guess there was always that
one thing that never changed.</i>

1435
01:36:40,528 --> 01:36:45,659
<i>It killed me to know that
she'd sit and wait for me,</i>

1436
01:36:45,661 --> 01:36:48,460
<i>and I'd never show up.</i>

1437
01:36:48,462 --> 01:36:52,693
<i>I missed my parents.
I wanted to see them so badly.</i>

1438
01:36:52,695 --> 01:36:55,227
<i>I wanted to hug them like
I'd never hugged them before.</i>

1439
01:36:55,229 --> 01:36:58,360
<i>I wanted to sit down and
talk to them about nothing.</i>

1440
01:36:58,362 --> 01:37:02,427
<i>I just wanted to be near them,
because they know who I am.</i>

1441
01:37:02,429 --> 01:37:04,860
<i>I was done pretending
to be someone else.</i>

1442
01:37:04,862 --> 01:37:08,160
<i>I just wanted
to be myself again.</i>

1443
01:37:27,495 --> 01:37:31,093
<i>And then, after two years,
I was released.</i>

1444
01:37:31,095 --> 01:37:35,360
<i>I could hardly believe it, 'cause I
was released under my fake name,</i>

1445
01:37:35,362 --> 01:37:37,426
<i>but the important thing was...</i>

1446
01:37:37,428 --> 01:37:39,459
Furlong, you're free to go.

1447
01:37:39,461 --> 01:37:41,459
<i>I was free,</i>

1448
01:37:41,461 --> 01:37:45,426
<i>and I was finally ready
to go home.</i>

1449
01:38:35,094 --> 01:38:37,860
- Hi.
- Hello.

1450
01:38:39,994 --> 01:38:41,826
How are you here?

1451
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,826
You're obviously very good
at what you do,

1452
01:38:47,828 --> 01:38:55,060
so if you'd like to get out of here
early and have a clean record...

1453
01:38:55,062 --> 01:38:57,093
We have a job for you.

1454
01:39:02,094 --> 01:39:04,559
<i>What the hell happened in there? Why'd
they let you go? What'd you tell 'em?</i>

1455
01:39:04,561 --> 01:39:06,260
<i>I told 'em I wouldn't
do it again. They let me go.</i>

1456
01:39:06,262 --> 01:39:07,659
<i>Just a little bit too easy.</i>

1457
01:39:07,661 --> 01:39:12,793
We have a guy we think
can get us closer to him.

1458
01:39:15,027 --> 01:39:18,559
- He's young.
- So are you.

1459
01:39:18,561 --> 01:39:20,459
We'll give him a way
to get him interested in you.

1460
01:39:20,461 --> 01:39:23,459
What do you know about
the New York stock exchange?

1461
01:39:23,461 --> 01:39:25,926
<i>You're going to
help him make money,</i>

1462
01:39:25,928 --> 01:39:28,693
<i>and we're going
to organize everything.</i>

1463
01:39:28,695 --> 01:39:30,893
<i>And if anyone ever
gets suspicious,</i>

1464
01:39:30,895 --> 01:39:32,659
<i>you just refer to me
as your uncle.</i>

1465
01:39:32,661 --> 01:39:34,426
<i>Where do you find these guys?</i>

1466
01:39:34,428 --> 01:39:36,693
<i>My uncle helped me.</i>

1467
01:39:36,695 --> 01:39:38,793
<i>Then you're gonna need
to get him to Hong Kong.</i>

1468
01:39:38,795 --> 01:39:41,493
Hong Kong is the place to be
for people like us.

1469
01:39:41,495 --> 01:39:43,026
<i>What if he doesn't fall for it?</i>

1470
01:39:43,028 --> 01:39:45,160
<i>We'll scare him into leaving.</i>

1471
01:39:45,162 --> 01:39:48,193
<i>I've been thinking about
what happened today,</i>

1472
01:39:48,195 --> 01:39:52,559
and I think it's a sign for us
to move somewhere else.

1473
01:39:52,561 --> 01:39:56,093
<i>Once you're there, you'll need
to push the ATM operation on him</i>

1474
01:39:56,095 --> 01:39:57,459
<i>so that zed notices you.</i>

1475
01:39:57,461 --> 01:40:01,227
I was talking about the ATM's.

1476
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:04,160
<i>And we will always be
nearby if something goes wrong.</i>

1477
01:40:04,162 --> 01:40:05,359
What happened? What's going on?

1478
01:40:05,361 --> 01:40:08,060
My uncle.

1479
01:40:08,062 --> 01:40:11,026
<i>What do you mean you
don't think he can do it?!</i>

1480
01:40:11,028 --> 01:40:12,893
<i>Are you falling for him
or something?</i>

1481
01:40:12,895 --> 01:40:15,793
<i>I had a different plan
for my life,</i>

1482
01:40:15,795 --> 01:40:17,926
<i>and now it's just different.</i>

1483
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:21,260
Oh, my god. It's zed.

1484
01:40:21,261 --> 01:40:24,893
<i>All we'll need is a paper trail that
shows that he financed the operation</i>

1485
01:40:24,895 --> 01:40:27,926
<i>and that he knew about
the market collapse.</i>

1486
01:40:27,928 --> 01:40:29,826
<i>We'll get him on
insider trading and fraud.</i>

1487
01:40:29,828 --> 01:40:31,826
I need a clean out
for me and Alex.

1488
01:40:31,828 --> 01:40:34,160
I will not do this if it means
him getting arrested.

1489
01:40:34,162 --> 01:40:35,593
Do you understand me?

1490
01:40:35,595 --> 01:40:37,127
<i>Sure, but...</i>

1491
01:40:37,129 --> 01:40:38,359
<i>You can never see him again.</i>

1492
01:40:38,361 --> 01:40:40,426
Fine.

1493
01:40:40,428 --> 01:40:42,227
Where were you?

1494
01:40:42,229 --> 01:40:43,227
Just using my phone.

1495
01:40:43,229 --> 01:40:45,393
<i>I wasn't lying when I said</i>

1496
01:40:45,395 --> 01:40:48,093
<i>we had to get
as far away as possible.</i>

1497
01:40:48,095 --> 01:40:50,060
<i>I was going to meet you there
and tell you everything,</i>

1498
01:40:50,062 --> 01:40:52,593
<i>but I didn't know that they had
other plans for me.</i>

1499
01:40:52,595 --> 01:40:54,860
<i>Zed's partner
in crime, Kira Whittal,</i>

1500
01:40:54,862 --> 01:40:59,326
<i>was shot dead while attempting
to flee from federal agents.</i>

1501
01:40:59,328 --> 01:41:01,393
No. Alex! You bastards!

1502
01:41:01,395 --> 01:41:02,726
<i>Alex!</i>

1503
01:41:02,728 --> 01:41:04,426
<i>As soon as I got out,
I went looking for you.</i>

1504
01:41:04,428 --> 01:41:08,893
<i>I knew the passport you had, so
it wasn't hard to track you down,</i>

1505
01:41:08,895 --> 01:41:12,226
<i>but took me a while
to get you out.</i>

1506
01:41:12,228 --> 01:41:14,593
<i>I wish I could have
sent you a note.</i>

1507
01:41:14,595 --> 01:41:17,559
<i>I wish I could have told you
that I was coming,</i>

1508
01:41:17,561 --> 01:41:22,426
but I couldn't risk it, in case they were
watching, so I had to wait till today.

1509
01:41:29,094 --> 01:41:30,292
Why didn't you just tell me?

1510
01:41:30,294 --> 01:41:31,726
I tried.

1511
01:41:31,728 --> 01:41:33,793
No, you didn't.
You lied to me.

1512
01:41:33,795 --> 01:41:36,760
You know... I never
really lied to you.

1513
01:41:36,762 --> 01:41:40,026
I just didn't tell you
the whole truth.

1514
01:41:41,427 --> 01:41:42,893
So, what are you doing here?

1515
01:41:42,895 --> 01:41:45,926
Can I give you a ride home?

1516
01:41:45,928 --> 01:41:49,093
Might have some trouble
crossing the border.

1517
01:41:50,327 --> 01:41:52,493
Not if you use
your real passport.

1518
01:41:59,994 --> 01:42:02,359
You okay to drive?

1519
01:42:02,361 --> 01:42:05,060
Um-hmm.

1520
01:42:07,827 --> 01:42:11,159
<i>In the end,
I got a chance to start over,</i>

1521
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:14,860
<i>live an honest life,
and make an honest living.</i>

1522
01:42:14,862 --> 01:42:16,659
<i>And, Kira, well,</i>

1523
01:42:16,661 --> 01:42:19,526
<i>I was just happy she was alive.</i>
