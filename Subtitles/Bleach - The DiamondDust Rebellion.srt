3
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:32,070
How's the defense here?

4
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,330
Vice-Captain Matsumoto, nothing out of the ordinary.

5
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,810
This is an important assignment, don't let your guard down.

6
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,070
Yes, ma'am.

7
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:42,726
Just what is this "King's Seal" though?

8
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,916
They demanded top security, yet they're being so conspicuous.

9
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,226
We don't even know any details about it.

10
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,098
It's a treasure of the royal family.

11
00:01:54,150 --> 00:01:58,790
It is forbidden for anyone to lay eyes upon it, except for the royalty.

12
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,536
The knowledge of this coveted treasure has been kept from the public.

13
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,736
We don't even have the right to know its abilities, nor how to use it.

14
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,436
And every few years it is taken into safekeeping, just like that.

15
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,716
The power to change, that is the King's Seal.

16
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:20,466
Just kidding, I don't really know myself.

17
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:25,176
Anyway, this is a mission that was entrusted to the 10th Squad.

18
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,010
Don't let your guard down and keep a careful watch.

19
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,817
Yes!

20
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,810
Captain!

21
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,590
Matsumoto?

22
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,785
The situation is normal at every post.

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,296
It looks quite impressive when I look at it carefully.

24
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,470
That's because the details are always shrouded.

25
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:50,356
Even you're saying that, Captain?

26
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,280
They'll get mad if you say that.

27
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,950
More importantly, you're...

28
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:02,497
What?

29
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:07,610
Matsumoto!

30
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,793
Yes!

31
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,210
Vice-Captain!

32
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:29,860
Surround it!

33
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,108
Yes!

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,620
Die.

35
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,790
Howl, Haineko!

36
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,624
Haineko (灰猫): Ash Cat

37
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,228
Who... are you?

38
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:13,922
Hold it!

39
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:40,692
Who are you?

40
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,070
Where's the King's Seal?

41
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:50,137
I don't know.

42
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,195
Captain!

43
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:56,466
How nostalgic.

44
00:04:56,490 --> 00:04:59,186
Show your face!

45
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,410
Hold it!

46
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,217
Captain!

47
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,788
Captain!

48
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,710
The King's Seal has...!

49
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:16,910
Put out those fires!

50
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:17,460
I'm on it!

51
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:20,206
Forgive us, Vice-Captain Matsumoto!

52
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,710
We let them escape!

53
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,310
We have several wounded.

54
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,700
Vice-Captain?

55
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,866
What is this?

56
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:37,045
Geez, why is there always trouble around my town.

57
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,920
What happened here?

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,950
You're the...

59
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,598
The Secret Mobile Corps?

60
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:10,726
Wait! I'm the substitute shinigami, Kurosaki Ichigo!

61
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,479
Hold it.

62
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,936
What are you doing here, Kurosaki Ichigo?

63
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,066
You're...

64
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:32,316
I'm Soifon, Captain of the 2nd Squad, and Commander of the Secret Mobile Corps.

65
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:38,636
I believe there was a barrier in place.

66
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,649
What happened?

67
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,491
What is all this?

68
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:04,946
Normally, I wouldn't be inclined to speak to an substitute shinigami...

69
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,456
W-What'd you say?

70
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,794
No way...

71
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,996
If you find it, inform me immediately.

72
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,698
Hey, w-wait!

73
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,651
Kurosaki?

74
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:42,506
Ishida? What are you doing here?

75
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:48,086
I noticed that a barrier was put up in this area.

76
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,296
What happened here?

77
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,430
Well, actually...

78
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,890
It's snowing.

79
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,796
No, he probably hid his reiatsu.

80
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,226
Huh? His reiatsu?

81
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,368
Toushirou!

82
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,703
Hey!

83
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,881
Toushirou!

84
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,607
Damn... it...

85
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,130
Is that so?

86
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,016
Yes.

87
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:58,276
We searched the entire perimeter, but we could not find the King's Seal.

88
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,846
I believe the attackers took it.

89
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:08,026
Furthermore, I have a report on the 10th Squad Captain, Hitsugaya,

90
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,710
who pursued them and had been charged with the escort.

91
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,440
There was evidence that he sealed his reiatsu...

92
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,702
Please wait!

93
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:20,030
You're saying it as if he abandoned his duties!

94
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,336
Then why did he act that way?

95
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,846
This is clearly a dereliction of his duties!

96
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,490
But, I...!

97
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:29,316
Stop.

98
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,526
The entire 10th Squad is hereby placed under house arrest.

99
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,736
Depending on developing circumstances, be prepared to disband.

100
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,470
Disband?

101
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:43,756
Do you mean to completely get rid of the 10th Squad?

102
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,630
The squad isn't at fault!

103
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,916
If someone should take responsibility, it should be me, the Vice-Captain!

104
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:53,446
Silence, Matsumoto!

105
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:59,516
Do you think the life of a single Vice-Captain can compensate for this crime?

106
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:02,946
Know your place.

107
00:11:03,950 --> 00:11:08,510
First, prioritize the search and recovery of the King's Seal and, at the same time,

108
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,730
capture the one responsible for the deaths in this incident,

109
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:17,926
the 10th Squad captain, Hitsugaya Toushirou.

110
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:23,930
This is an urgent case.

111
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:34,446
The 10th Squad is hereby confined to this shrine.

112
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,680
Furthermore, until we capture Captain Hitsugaya and resolve this incident,

113
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:45,800
to guard against treason, we will take your zanpakutous.

114
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,640
W-Why?!

115
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,690
No way!

116
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:51,346
You don't trust us?!

117
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,100
Are you telling us to just stay here and do nothing?!

118
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,216
That's ridiculous!

119
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,846
This is tyranny!

120
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,346
Give us the chance to prove our innocence!

121
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:04,606
This is an order!

122
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:05,760
Vice-Captain!

123
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,179
Vice-Captain Matsumoto!

124
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,812
Excuse us.

125
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,076
I guess that's all.

126
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,996
They don't know anything yet, then.

127
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,936
Yet...

128
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:42,236
It just shows how important the stolen King's Seal is.

129
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:47,166
I'm sure Captain Hitsugaya will return soon.

130
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,906
Yeah.

131
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:53,696
Damnit, why does everyone just disappear without saying anything?

132
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,193
Captain Hitsugaya is different from Ichimaru!

133
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,462
Renji.

134
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:05,700
We've finished collecting the zanpakutou.

135
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,100
We'll take them to storage now.

136
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,216
Very well.

137
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:12,926
Everyone is to wait here patiently and await further instructions.

138
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,386
We'll be closing the shrine now.

139
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:18,266
Please return to the line, Vice-Captain Matsumoto.

140
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,556
It's time, Vice-Captain Abarai.

141
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,876
All right, I'll go now.

142
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:23,760
Let's go.

143
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,255
Excuse us.

144
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,961
Wait!

145
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:33,389
There's one thing I want you to investigate.

146
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:39,406
The man that the captain chased,

147
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:43,116
I think he has something to do with the captain.

148
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,392
Otherwise, the captain wouldn't have done that.

149
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,736
Are you the rumored boy genius, Hitsugaya Toushirou?

150
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,243
Who are you?

151
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:10,556
I'm going to become a shinigami, and risk my life for soul society!

152
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:13,096
Oh? Really?

153
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,330
I...

154
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,800
That's amazing, Toushirou! You really are a genius!

155
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,260
That has nothing to do with it.

156
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,031
I won't lose next time though.

157
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:33,404
Toushirou, we'll always be friends, right?

158
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,252
Where is this?

159
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,264
Hey.

160
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,136
Kurosaki?

161
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,270
Where is this?

162
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,690
My house.

163
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:57,540
You were all beat up, I couldn't just leave you.

164
00:14:57,540 --> 00:15:01,736
I see, thank you.

165
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,326
The Secret Mobile Corps are searching for you.

166
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,536
Yeah.

167
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,056
"Yeah?" That's it?

168
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,460
Why are you hiding?

169
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,037
Say something!

170
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:20,456
It has nothing to do with you.

171
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,482
You bastard...!

172
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,426
Well, whatever.

173
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,647
I have to get it back.

174
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:33,916
They stole the royal treasure, the King's Seal.

175
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:40,427
This isn't something a substitute shinigami should be involved with.

176
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:48,836
You've really got zero charm, you know that?

177
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,076
H-hey, you okay?

178
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,986
It's nothing.

179
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:57,248
Sorry, but I need a little more rest.

180
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:05,096
Sheesh, I'll call Inoue tomorrow morning, so just stay still until then.

181
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,706
Man...

182
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,196
Stop sneaking around!

183
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:52,230
If you're going to leave, then leave through the front door!

184
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:57,456
Why are you acting like a fugitive?

185
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:02,004
Thank you for taking care of me.

186
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:08,016
Why are you going by yourself?

187
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,826
Why are you brooding over this so much?

188
00:17:11,850 --> 00:17:13,656
What are you trying to say?

189
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:17,546
Does it have to do with this "Kusaka?"

190
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,182
Who is he?

191
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:26,736
Was Kusaka the one who attacked you and stole the King's Seal?

192
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:30,231
It's the name of a man who was killed.

193
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,426
Killed?

194
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,984
By who?

195
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,093
Toushirou!

196
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,276
What are you doing?!

197
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,746
Don't interfere!

198
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:52,466
Shut up! You were thrashed and bleeding at my feet, you expected me to leave you?!

199
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:05,994
Either I report you to the Secret Mobile Corps, or you go back to my house. Choose.

200
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,241
Who's there?!

201
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,706
Hand Hitsugaya Toushirou over to us.

202
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:31,696
What'd you say?

203
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,220
If you get in our way, then we'll eliminate you!

204
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,616
Toushirou!

205
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,513
What's going on?

206
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,785
Toushirou!

207
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,359
Please!

208
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:40,203
Then how about this?!

209
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:56,470
Getsuga Tenshou!

210
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:59,317
Getsuga Tenshou (月牙天衝): Lunar Fang Piercing the Heavens

211
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:10,826
How could he repel that attack?

212
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,205
Just who is that man?

213
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,140
Wait!

214
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,454
Toushirou!

215
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:37,670
What are you trying to do?

216
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,980
Pull yourself together, Ichigo.

217
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,210
Ichigo!

218
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,520
How pathetic.

219
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,719
Well, looks like I win.

220
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:00,889
Wake up, damn Ichigo!

221
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,540
See? My way got him up faster, right?

222
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,720
You bastard! What the hell was that for?

223
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,130
It's your fault for staying knocked out!

224
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:14,656
What'd you say?

225
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:17,813
What happened, Ichigo?

226
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:24,830
Damnit...

227
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,836
Just how long was I out?

228
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,010
Where did Toushirou go?

229
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,620
Toushirou?

230
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,360
Don't tell me, you met Captain Hitsugaya?

231
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,246
When? Where he'd go?

232
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:40,363
You...

233
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,146
That coat... belongs to Captain Hitsugaya.

234
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:54,036
That guy...

235
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:57,326
Why didn't you stop him?

236
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,510
I did! But he just left!

237
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:03,736
He chased after some weird girls.

238
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,596
Girls?

239
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,886
They looked like Vizards, or Arrancar...

240
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,360
I don't really know.

241
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,016
So, what did Captain Hitsugaya say?

242
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,830
He didn't say anything?

243
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:19,506
Well, he said he'd get back the King's Seal.

244
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,986
But that's not it.

245
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,586
He had to...

246
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,986
That's right, who's Kusaka?

247
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,616
Kusaka?

248
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:32,006
He said it's the name of a man who was killed.

249
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,267
And then he...

250
00:22:38,810 --> 00:22:44,466
Renji, can you go back to Soul Society and look into this Kusaka?

251
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,856
It might have to do with the attackers that Vice-Captain Matsumoto was talking about.

252
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:52,246
Sure, but why me?

253
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:57,316
I don't think I'll be allowed to meet with her.

254
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,394
Plus...

255
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:05,652
I don't like playing this role.

256
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,160
We don't need two shinigami.

257
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,410
We must decide,

258
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:11,950
We must choose...

259
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,870
One must be chosen!

260
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:15,926
The rightful owner!

261
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:19,326
Then I'll give up Hyourinmaru!

262
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:21,170
You cannot defy us.

263
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,260
You cannot doubt us.

264
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:27,616
The decisions of the Central 46 Chambers are absolute.

265
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,890
Stop! Kusaka is...

266
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:33,400
Kusaka is my important...!

267
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,856
How was Hitsugaya?

268
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:10,570
It seems the Gotei 13 haven't made contact with him yet.

269
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:13,770
Shall we capture him before they do?

270
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,106
No, let us keep watch a bit more.

271
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:22,650
As long as his power is the same as mine, he no longer belongs anywhere.

272
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:26,966
He'll have no choice but to join us.

273
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:33,406
Captain Hitsugaya entered the Shinou Spiritual Institute

274
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:37,796
after I was taken in by the Kuchiki family, so I don't really know.

275
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,780
We grew up in different parts of Rukongai.

276
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:45,996
I in Inuzuri and Captain Hitsugaya in Junrinan.

277
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,800
I heard that the 5th Squad's Vice-Captain Hinamori was like a sister to him.

278
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,480
Then we should talk to Hinamori.

279
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,962
Yeah.

280
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:59,096
Unfortunately, she's recuperating right now.

281
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:07,186
Also, this is just a guess, but I don't believe he told her anything important.

282
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:11,175
Even more so if it's a burden.

283
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:16,873
I think he's that kind of person.

284
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,896
He's strong.

285
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:22,299
He's not strong at all.

286
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:29,513
If he was so strong, why would he worry everyone around him?

287
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:43,306
There's no point thinking it over anymore.

288
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:52,976
I'll use some of my resources at hand, everyone is to search for Captain Hitsugaya.

289
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,780
No! Meeting Vice-Captain Matsumoto Rangiku is forbidden!

290
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:01,120
Come on!

291
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,920
We're just going to talk!

292
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:09,946
No, no! This is an order from the Commander-General and 2nd Squad Captain Soifon!

293
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:13,040
So all you can do is follow orders?

294
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,736
You otter-face.

295
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,180
What'd you say?

296
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,786
Did you just make fun of me?

297
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,890
I didn't.

298
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:23,526
You just called me a otter-face!

299
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,110
I don't know what you're talking about!

300
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,723
How lively!

301
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,106
Captain Kyouraku.

302
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:36,499
I'll go in with him, that'll be fine right?

303
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:41,036
You can't trust the 8th Squad Captain?

304
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,997
Kusaka?

305
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:46,606
I don't know, I've never heard of him.

306
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:48,306
I see.

307
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:55,571
How could a Vice-Captain not know anything about their Captain?

308
00:26:57,150 --> 00:27:01,096
First, there are several things we don't know.

309
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,716
How is Captain Hitsugaya related to this Kusaka?

310
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,670
Just who is he?

311
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,206
Is he related to the incident?

312
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:12,836
And if he is, why?

313
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,486
One mystery after another.

314
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:17,162
We just need to look into it.

315
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,820
Could you?

316
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:23,866
It's impossible to know everything there is to know about a person.

317
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:27,530
It may take some time, but if we don't know, we'll just have to dig deeper.

318
00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:30,637
Isn't it simple?

319
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,340
What, Captain?

320
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,230
Just as expected from Nanao-chan!

321
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:42,026
I'm sure you can do it, right?

322
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,650
Please help us!

323
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,076
Thanks a lot, Nanao. I'll pay you back someday.

324
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,906
You can thank us with this.

325
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:54,930
You wouldn't mind helping me then, Captain?

326
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,590
Eh? Me too?

327
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,936
Of course!

328
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,337
There's also this.

329
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:20,006
This is from Rukia and Ichigo in the real world.

330
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,746
He's hurt.

331
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:27,063
According to Ichigo, it's pretty bad.

332
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:32,318
Yet he left this and disappeared.

333
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,686
I don't know whether to be happy that he's alive,

334
00:28:36,710 --> 00:28:41,936
or to be angry that he left his coat behind.

335
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,466
Well...

336
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,306
Man...

337
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:54,533
Everyone's so worried, so what the heck is he doing?

338
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,980
My name is Hyourinmaru.

339
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,980
Hyourinmaru (氷輪丸): The Icy Moon

340
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,580
Child, will you be the one to wield me?

341
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,452
That's right!

342
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:22,202
Obey me, Hyourinmaru!

343
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:37,101
I did it. I did it!

344
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:39,566
Toushirou?

345
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:41,930
What a coincidence.

346
00:29:41,930 --> 00:29:47,468
I'm happy we got the same power.

347
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:31,056
I've researched the names of all Captains for the last 50 years, but there's no one named Kusaka.

348
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,610
Did you go back and search through the Spiritual Arts Academy?

349
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:37,860
Yes, there was no similar name there.

350
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:44,960
But I discovered a discrepancy in the number of registered students in Hitugaya's graduating class.

351
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,966
The missing student was registered in the north of Rukongai.

352
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:53,226
Of those registered from that district, was there a student named Kusaka?

353
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,226
There was.

354
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,906
Here he is...

355
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,866
Kusaka Sojiro.

356
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,856
This is Kusaka, eh?

357
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,720
He's... dead?

358
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:06,926
He's not on the registry. Maybe they just forgot to write it in?

359
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:10,506
No, something like that shouldn't be possible, right?

360
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,466
Especially if he died.

361
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:20,576
But with this, at least, the possibility of the assailant being Kusaka Sojiro is gone, right?

362
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:27,106
As soon as the extinguishment of his reiatsu was confirmed,

363
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,466
he should have been dead, however...

364
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:32,506
"However..." what?

365
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:34,726
I'm taking a little walk.

366
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,786
Nanao-chan, look into the cause of death.

367
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,968
Captain!

368
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:28,448
My, my... who is it?

369
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,026
Your silence is piquing my curiosity.

370
00:32:34,050 --> 00:32:35,950
Kyouraku Shunsui...

371
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:39,830
That frivolous behavior is a mask for your prudence...

372
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:44,270
You wield your charisma and swagger like a finely honed blade.

373
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:47,110
You'd sniffed me out from the beginning after all?

374
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:53,400
What a compliment.  But instead of talking about me, how about talking about yourself?

375
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,010
That's unnecessary.

376
00:32:55,010 --> 00:33:01,523
You'll be slain right here by Hitsugaya Toushirou.

377
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:08,776
That zanpakutou...

378
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,595
Show your face...

379
00:33:14,430 --> 00:33:16,263
You're...

380
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,156
Captain Hitsugaya! It's the special forces.

381
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:45,951
We urge you. Please return to Seireitei.

382
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:54,096
I have no intention of obeying.

383
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,896
Please stop this. Further actions will be regarded as treason.

384
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,676
Stand down, Kira! Hisagi!

385
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:10,206
Captain Hitsugaya, I'm taking you into custody.

386
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:11,920
You'll die...

387
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:27,444
Way of Binding #62: A Hundred Stepped Rails!

388
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,620
Please come quietly...

389
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:06,028
Reign over the frozen sky... Hyourinmaru!

390
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,360
The preparation for the Spirit-cleansing barrier is complete.

391
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,143
I will start the surgery immediately.

392
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,095
It's my fault.

393
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,618
It wasn't under your control.

394
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,410
Captain Ukitake.

395
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:46,020
If Kyouraku was defeated, it's either because his opponent surprised him,

396
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,216
or truly was more powerful than him.

397
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,787
Am I wrong?

398
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:53,340
However?

399
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,186
I'll say once more.

400
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,979
It's not your fault.

401
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:02,666
Right now, the 6th Squad is investigating the scene.

402
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,161
We'll catch the assassin right away.

403
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:28,276
There's no mistake about it. It's Hyourinmaru!

404
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,516
What? Hyourinmaru?

405
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,270
Captain Hitsugaya.

406
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,741
You don't look like you have good news, either.

407
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,140
Reporting.

408
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:48,500
Kira Izuru of the 3rd Squad and Hisagi Shuuhei of the 9th Squad

409
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:55,910
engaged Captain Hitsugaya, and were severely injured in the real world.

410
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,870
He turned on them?

411
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:20,220
Toushirou-kun attacked his friends?

412
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,590
That's not all...

413
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:24,676
...it seems that Captain Kyouraku was attacked.

414
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,754
Kyouraku-san?

415
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,286
According to what Renji told me, he was attacked with Hyourinmaru, and is in serious condition.

416
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,790
Ishida, can you track his reiatsu?

417
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:38,396
It's your specialty, right?

418
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,546
It's impossible.

419
00:37:39,570 --> 00:37:43,262
Shit, he slipped through our fingers again.

420
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:50,706
It's morning already...

421
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,500
Sorry, everyone.

422
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:57,060
Let's go home, and meet up again in the afternoon.

423
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,270
Don't you worry, I'm fine...

424
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:03,636
No, it will be alright.

425
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,263
Even if we rush it, it doesn't mean we'll find him right away, so...

426
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:20,916
Hitsugaya Toushirou is suspected of treason, and is hereby suspended from the Gotei Squads.

427
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:25,070
Excuse my interruption, but is that not something of a political measure?

428
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:27,846
I will take no objections!

429
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:30,970
The search for the King's Seal is to continue. Furthermore,

430
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,630
Hitsugaya Toushirou's capture is also of high priority.

431
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:38,500
If he shows signs of resistance, then...

432
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:41,919
execute him immediately!

433
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,350
Ichigo, it's Renji.

434
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:56,396
A Gotei Squad order has been issued.

435
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,940
What's that?

436
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:03,036
An execution order has been issued for Captain Hitsugaya.

437
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:06,356
An execution order? What the hell?

438
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:11,276
Looks like there was no time for debate and no chance of pardon.

439
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,354
What?

440
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,400
Rukia, there's more. We found out about Kusaka.

441
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,526
Ichigo.

442
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:20,643
Yeah, I heard it.

443
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:25,700
Kisaka Sojiro. He's Captain Hitsugaya's former classmate.

444
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:35,086
He died before graduating from the Spiritual Arts Academy.

445
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,606
You!

446
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,780
We warned you...

447
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,776
If you interfered, you'd be done for.

448
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,696
Shinigami, huh?

449
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,929
Who's there?

450
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,230
Ichigo, that man is very capable.

451
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,973
That's no ordinary reiatsu.

452
00:39:59,690 --> 00:40:03,213
That's Hyourinmaru!

453
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,446
You have it backwards, Kyouraku...

454
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:16,711
I'm supposed to be the one that's sick and bedridden.

455
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,430
But now...

456
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,846
There is one thing that still troubles me.

457
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:30,580
If you compare the time of the attack by Hyourinmaru,

458
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:35,689
and the time the search crew found Captain Hitsugaya,

459
00:40:38,370 --> 00:40:40,640
no matter what path you take to the Real World...

460
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:43,596
it should take longer.

461
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:49,186
Assuming they were both the same Hyourinmaru...

462
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,317
Reign over the frozen sky...

463
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,345
Hyourinmaru!

464
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,820
Why do you...

465
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:13,071
Because I am the true master of Hyourinmaru!

466
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,456
What did you say?

467
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:20,134
Twin zanpakutou, you said?

468
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:24,460
Zanpakutou are born from the shinigami's own soul.

469
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:31,030
First, the link between zanpakutou and shinigami is a binding contract.

470
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,820
Second, it is impossible to have a zanpakutou with multiple binding contracts.

471
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:37,900
That's not a zanpakutou.

472
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:41,850
Can you prove that something of that sort couldn't exist?

473
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:45,036
That there couldn't have been more than one Hyourinmaru?

474
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,166
Hyourinmaru?

475
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,330
Assuming there were two shinigami, then one of the owners must be...

476
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,740
I see!

477
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:56,396
Now I understand the reason you've asked me to investigate this...

478
00:41:56,420 --> 00:42:06,053
Hacking into the Great Spiritual Libraries is nothing to me.

479
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,128
You... who the hell are you?

480
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:30,146
My name? Kusaka Sojiro!

481
00:42:30,170 --> 00:42:31,290
This is...!

482
00:42:31,290 --> 00:42:34,740
The man who, in the Central 46 Chambers of Seireitei,

483
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:39,654
was murdered by Hitsugaya Toushirou!

484
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:48,350
Soul Society has declared Hitsugaya Toushirou to be a criminal.

485
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,540
He has no place to return to.

486
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:53,946
The only remaining wild card is you.

487
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:57,753
Now you will die, shinigami!

488
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:18,446
Toushirou!
- Kusaka! Why?

489
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:23,006
The decision of the Central 46 Chambers is as follows.

490
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:28,016
It is forbidden for one zanpakutou to belong to two shinigami.

491
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:30,806
For that reason, today both parties will face each other...

492
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,356
and decide the issue through a duel.

493
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:38,956
Do you mean for us to kill each other?

494
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:40,940
One's righteous nature...

495
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,846
One's own abilities...

496
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:48,446
For its sheer power, you should feel honored to wield Hyourinmaru.

497
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:53,370
I refuse! If I'm to fight with Kusaka, I'd rather relinquish Hyourinmaru!

498
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,450
Tou...
- Not allowed!

499
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:55,450
That is forbidden!

500
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:56,540
Forbidden!

501
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:59,696
Why can't we have the same zanpakutou?

502
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,416
It is decided.

503
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,120
Because that is the law.

504
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,900
A law that has been in place since the beginning of time.

505
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,080
You cannot go against it.

506
00:44:06,890 --> 00:44:08,160
We won't allow questioning!

507
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,250
We won't allow it!

508
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,310
Fight!

509
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,480
Battle!

510
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,340
Fight!

511
00:44:12,340 --> 00:44:13,360
Fight!

512
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,765
Fight!

513
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,767
Hitsugaya...

514
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,637
Kusaka...

515
00:44:27,050 --> 00:44:28,636
Hey!

516
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:31,226
Who are you people?

517
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:32,810
What?

518
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:38,346
The match has been decided. Hitsugaya Toushirou will wield Hyourinmaru.

519
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:41,016
This duel isn't finished!

520
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,426
Hyourinmaru is mine!

521
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:47,386
It's been decided by the Six Scholars.

522
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,985
Please wait! Just once more...

523
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,374
Kusaka!

524
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,546
Why am I...

525
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,790
The one who has to die?

526
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,971
Why?

527
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:13,516
I... swore my life to Soul Society...

528
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,829
Kusaka!

529
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:41,670
Hitsugaya is on my side as a friend.

530
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,590
I won't let you get in the way!

531
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:46,489
Hyourinmaru!

532
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:52,075
Ichigo!

533
00:46:01,270 --> 00:46:05,776
Hyourinmaru's powers are growing.

534
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:08,700
It's time. I'll let you two clean up here.

535
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,078
Yes.

536
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,710
Way of Destruction #33: Soukatsui!

537
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:20,544
Soukatsui (蒼火墜): Blue Fire Crash

538
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,740
Zangetsu!

539
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,486
It's been a while, Ichigo.

540
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,746
What was that just now? A hallucination?

541
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:44,656
Resonance.

542
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:49,656
When two zanpakutous clash, as they resonate, they will reveal their past.

543
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,650
Then...

544
00:46:50,650 --> 00:46:54,646
Yeah. It's all true.

545
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,510
So because two Hyourinmarus happened to exist...

546
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:00,946
Soul Society killed a man?!

547
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,216
Why?!

548
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,396
Because that is the custom.

549
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:12,860
In Soul Society, the highest and most revered law is to maintain balance.

550
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:16,256
Those bastards. Don't they care about people's emotions?

551
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,840
You sure say strange things.

552
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:23,850
The world's fate cannot rely on our feeble sentiments.

553
00:47:23,850 --> 00:47:26,426
No matter how powerful the emotion, there is no comparison.

554
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:30,556
Is your world any different?

555
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:31,420
Nevertheless...

556
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:39,946
Human hearts waver, falter, and inevitably plunge into darkness.

557
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:43,266
You're wrong.

558
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:45,162
He...

559
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:48,056
Toushirou isn't like that.

560
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,450
Why do you believe that?

561
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:52,166
Because...

562
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:54,976
Don't, Ichigo!

563
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:01,146
Because I once suffered the same way.

564
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,760
Not long after my mom died...

565
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,930
A lot of different emotions surfaced within me.

566
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,426
It felt like I was drowning in them.

567
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:12,430
But, I kept all of those feelings locked up inside.

568
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:18,527
I thought it was something everyone had to do.

569
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:34,016
I didn't realize how much you hurt yourself by doing that.

570
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:39,110
Toushirou had the same expression as I had back then!

571
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:45,126
He's keeping everything inside!

572
00:48:45,150 --> 00:48:46,671
That's it.

573
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,346
I figured it out...

574
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,556
What he's trying to do.

575
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,738
Thanks.

576
00:48:56,540 --> 00:49:00,726
If you can see the future, don't ever look back.

577
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:06,275
Strike forward, never hesitate.  Go, Ichigo!

578
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,659
Rukia!

579
00:49:26,890 --> 00:49:28,300
Ichigo... Are you okay?

580
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,296
Yeah, where is Kusaka?

581
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,990
Sorry, he got away.

582
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:36,426
Alright, then we will have to beat these guys and chase after him.

583
00:49:36,450 --> 00:49:38,376
I figured it out...

584
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,638
What Toushirou wants to do.

585
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,280
He survived Kusaka-sama's attack...

586
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,360
What an annoying little pest.

587
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,500
We must defeat him.

588
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,710
Obviously!

589
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,000
I have to tell him...

590
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,250
...no matter what happens!

591
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:41,200
You finally found me.

592
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:44,346
I've been waiting for you.

593
00:50:44,370 --> 00:50:45,776
Kusaka!

594
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:50,736
I wounded you with Hyourinmaru for a reason.

595
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:53,996
Do you believe now that I am alive?

596
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:58,266
It doesn't really matter, does it, Hitsugaya?

597
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:02,416
We've been trapped at this crossroads long enough, wouldn't you say?

598
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:04,312
Crossroads?

599
00:51:04,660 --> 00:51:11,456
You've seen what the Gotei 13 Squads are capable of!

600
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,616
Even so, you still stay with them?

601
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:19,040
Maybe it's because of that girl?

602
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:24,346
Leave Hinamori out of this, where's the King's Seal?

603
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:32,596
Right here, where it belongs. This power will make our dreams come true, right?

604
00:51:32,620 --> 00:51:33,690
Dreams...

605
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:35,876
Of course.

606
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:39,896
What is the power of the King's Seal?! How do you know about it?!

607
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,756
There is no need to rush, you'll know its power soon enough.

608
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,614
Now, let's go.

609
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,216
What?

610
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:01,516
Rukia, what is that?

611
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,056
I don't know...

612
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:08,846
This reiatsu is so powerful and pure, I've never felt anything like it.

613
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:09,962
It can't be!

614
00:52:12,130 --> 00:52:16,126
That is the King's Seal's true power!

615
00:52:16,150 --> 00:52:23,176
It's begun! The vengeance of Kusaka-sama and Hitsugaya Toushirou against Seireitei!

616
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,666
What? Seireitei?

617
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:31,270
You are a risk, and thus you must be eliminated at all costs!

618
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:36,376
We won't let you interfere in Kusaka-sama's plans!

619
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,276
Hollows?!

620
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,290
Hollows, charge!

621
00:52:54,010 --> 00:53:02,566
Excuse me, reiatsu from the King's Seal has appeared above Soukyoku Hill.

622
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,606
Vice-Captain!

623
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:09,396
Hey, you guys aren't supposed to leave! Got that!?

624
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:12,202
What the hell is that?!

625
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:14,238
Captain!

626
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:20,496
<i>Emergency alert: To all search parties in Soul Society and the Real World,</i>

627
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:27,080
<i>The reiatsu of both Captain Hitsugaya and the thief of the King's Seal has been detected upon Soukyoku Hill.</i>

628
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,420
<i>Please, return and immediately begin emergency defensive procedures.</i>

629
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:36,376
<i>I repeat, please return and immediately begin emergency defensive procedures.</i>

630
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,816
For the intruders to have trespassed so easily...

631
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:45,856
The enemy must have known that the Gotei 13 Squads were in disarray.

632
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,310
The enemy?

633
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:51,717
He is Captain Hitsugaya.

634
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,906
This is...

635
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:10,276
Right, this is Soukyoku Hill. This is the power of the King's Seal.

636
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:17,860
The King's Seal grants the ability to traverse time, space, and the infinite dimensions.

637
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:22,390
In other words, it makes teleportation into child's play.

638
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:25,670
I can deflect any attack by merely sending it to another dimension before it arrives.

639
00:54:25,670 --> 00:54:31,546
If I do get injured, I can return my body to any point in time before the injury.

640
00:54:31,570 --> 00:54:34,530
Kusaka, that means...?

641
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:42,926
Yes, I was transported to Hueco Mondo and reincarnated there.

642
00:54:42,950 --> 00:54:48,466
I have searched for the power of the King's Seal ever since...

643
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:53,573
In order to exact my revenge on Seireitei!

644
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,277
Toushirou!

645
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,586
Cut it open with your bankai.

646
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:02,926
Cut it?

647
00:55:02,950 --> 00:55:04,126
The King's Seal?

648
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:10,975
Yes, and after that, everything will turn to dust!

649
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:21,680
Looks like we're first.

650
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,466
Looks like it, Ikkaku.

651
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,830
Captain Hitsugaya! Why?

652
00:55:26,830 --> 00:55:28,966
Shut it, Renji.

653
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:32,766
Talking is useless at this point.

654
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:35,750
Based on the emergency alert and our own orders,

655
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:39,466
we are to arrest Hitsugaya Toushirou, and the one who stole the King's Seal.

656
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:41,470
Madarame Ikkaku.

657
00:55:41,470 --> 00:55:47,676
Among the Gotei 13, you are the most skilled at combining raw power and skillful technique.

658
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,710
Flattery will get you nothing.

659
00:55:49,710 --> 00:55:53,636
However you are not my opponent.

660
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,235
Is that so?!

661
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,376
Even with that wound...

662
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,010
You're still serious about this?

663
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:06,330
Why are you pushing yourself so far?!

664
00:56:06,330 --> 00:56:08,186
Captain Hitsugaya!

665
00:56:08,210 --> 00:56:10,537
Stay out of my way...

666
00:56:16,490 --> 00:56:19,116
There're so many...!

667
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:21,793
Kurosaki!

668
00:56:23,350 --> 00:56:24,670
Didn't you say that if anything happened,

669
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,660
you would tell me?!

670
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,690
The Hollows are...!

671
00:56:37,690 --> 00:56:38,666
Damn them!

672
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,260
My Ginrei Kojaku can fire 1200 rounds per second.

673
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:42,776
Ginrei Kojaku (銀嶺弧雀): Silver Mountain Arcing Sparrow

674
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:46,936
You can't summon those Hollows anywhere near fast enough!

675
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:48,670
Are you alright, Kurosaki-kun?

676
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,040
Ishida, you jerk!

677
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:51,600
You could have hit me!

678
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,526
My aim is better than that.

679
00:56:53,550 --> 00:56:54,656
Anyway,

680
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,448
They're coming.

681
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:59,876
It's huge.

682
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:03,466
Ishida, I'll take care of this—

683
00:57:03,490 --> 00:57:06,064
El Directo!

684
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,326
Now's your chance, Ichigo.

685
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:21,026
Get to Soul Society!

686
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:23,750
Urahara-san is currently preparing a Senkaimon.

687
00:57:21,050 --> 00:57:24,386
Senkaimon (穿界門): World Penetration Gate

688
00:57:24,410 --> 00:57:26,640
We'll deal with these guys.

689
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:29,643
Save Toushirou-kun!

690
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:31,886
You guys...

691
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,896
We're off, Rukia.

692
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,650
Be careful, Inoue.

693
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,717
Yeah.

694
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,351
That's enough!

695
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,750
Captain!

696
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:58,576
Surrender, Hitsugaya!

697
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,837
And that man behind you.

698
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:07,349
Ridiculous.

699
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:09,836
Just who...

700
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,180
Are you?!

701
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,146
Toushirou.

702
00:58:13,170 --> 00:58:14,930
What are you doing?

703
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:18,720
Unleash your rage!

704
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:20,780
Show them our grudge...

705
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:24,666
Show them our suffering!

706
00:58:24,690 --> 00:58:26,780
This will be our revenge!

707
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:29,886
Cut it, Toushirou!

708
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:32,224
Seize them!

709
00:58:37,230 --> 00:58:41,598
Getsuga Tenshou!

710
00:58:47,530 --> 00:58:49,558
What?

711
00:58:52,390 --> 00:58:54,470
Stop it!

712
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:58,356
Can't you guys do anything other than fight?!

713
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:02,236
You don't know anything about Toushirou!

714
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:04,270
Just because it's been ordered,

715
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:06,360
you shouldn't just attack him the first chance you get!

716
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,670
Stay out of this, substitute!

717
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,106
This is part of the squad's duty!

718
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:16,126
They are following orders from a superior officer. This is the rule we live by, no matter the cost!

719
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:18,080
I just told you, you don't understand!

720
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:19,750
There's no use arguing!

721
00:59:19,750 --> 00:59:24,313
If you still oppose us, we will cut you down too!

722
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:29,244
Wait!

723
00:59:38,290 --> 00:59:43,555
Captain-Commander Yamamoto Genryuusai Shigekuni!

724
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:53,086
Kyouraku! You're conscious again?

725
00:59:53,110 --> 00:59:54,960
Seems that way.

726
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,386
I can't sleep properly when the innocent are being persecuted.

727
01:00:01,410 --> 01:00:05,556
So you're alive, Kusaka Sojiro!

728
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:12,600
You thought you had killed me?

729
01:00:13,070 --> 01:00:16,700
The King's Seal gave you life...

730
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:21,336
...and you were raised in Hueco Mundo.

731
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,250
Yeah.

732
01:00:22,250 --> 01:00:24,836
And so I've returned!

733
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:27,060
Thanks to the King's Seal, I got my life back,

734
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:32,206
And I will use the King's Seal to become the King of Soul Society!

735
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,250
Soul Society's King, you say?

736
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,721
How arrogant!

737
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,936
You're the ones who are arrogant.

738
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,314
You should realize this!

739
01:00:54,040 --> 01:00:55,639
Captain!

740
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:59,106
Stay back, Matsumoto!

741
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,140
This is my battle.

742
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:05,646
What's the meaning of this, Toushirou?!

743
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:07,196
I...

744
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:10,896
I never had any intention of helping you.

745
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,790
He never betrayed the Gotei 13 Squads.

746
01:01:15,790 --> 01:01:18,950
Then why did he point his blade at us?

747
01:01:18,950 --> 01:01:21,010
You're going to cut me down?

748
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,410
You're going to kill me again?!

749
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,170
I am merely atoning for my sin.

750
01:01:27,170 --> 01:01:29,450
And what is your sin?

751
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:33,961
How can you atone for it by killing me?

752
01:01:34,510 --> 01:01:36,186
I see.

753
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,470
Kusaka originally...

754
01:01:37,470 --> 01:01:40,766
swore his allegiance to Soul Society.

755
01:01:40,790 --> 01:01:45,856
However, just because there were twin zanpakutou,

756
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:52,086
he was exiled and killed, and couldn't attain honor in Soul Society.

757
01:01:52,110 --> 01:01:53,206
Yes.

758
01:01:53,230 --> 01:01:56,976
And he blames his friend's pain all on himself.

759
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:04,526
Captain Hitsugaya couldn't bear to kill Kusaka again, not with his current status among the Gotei 13.

760
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:06,456
Is that what you meant?

761
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:07,636
To settle this,

762
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:15,876
he needed to strip himself of his status among the squads.

763
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:21,916
Even if that meant he would be the one to be executed this time.

764
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:24,590
So from the very start...!

765
01:02:24,590 --> 01:02:26,436
That's right!

766
01:02:26,460 --> 01:02:27,680
I see.

767
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:32,750
So I misunderstood you.

768
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:39,326
Then I will do this on my own!

769
01:02:39,350 --> 01:02:42,776
Answer my call, King's Seal!

770
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,596
Just what...?!

771
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:49,566
I couldn't get you to release it using your bankai...

772
01:02:49,590 --> 01:02:53,490
But, I can do it now...

773
01:03:05,220 --> 01:03:09,216
Kusaka!!

774
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,650
You're not the only one drowning in pain.

775
01:03:11,650 --> 01:03:14,796
Move, Kurosaki!

776
01:03:14,820 --> 01:03:17,670
You don't have to shoulder this burden alone!

777
01:03:17,670 --> 01:03:22,856
Let the ones around you understand and take some of the pain, and the resolve that goes with it!

778
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,352
I'm not a Captain anymore.

779
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:30,906
You decided that by yourself!

780
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:33,526
But have you even considered,

781
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,722
how the people around you feel?!

782
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:45,420
I once knew someone like you who didn't rely on others,

783
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:46,650
I understand people like you...

784
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:49,146
Older brother!

785
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:54,806
Older brother.

786
01:03:54,830 --> 01:03:56,250
Yuzu, Karin.

787
01:03:56,250 --> 01:04:00,267
Why are you in such a hurry?

788
01:04:02,870 --> 01:04:04,080
Ichi-nii...

789
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:06,866
Why are you smiling?

790
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,659
"Why"?

791
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,380
Ichigo.

792
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:21,966
We all understand your feelings,

793
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:26,189
After all, we're a family, aren't we?

794
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:29,560
Happy things, sad things.

795
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,226
We share all those things.

796
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:39,088
Otherwise, won't we get lonely?

797
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:47,246
But.

798
01:04:47,270 --> 01:04:52,197
In fact, that person was the weakest of them all!

799
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:57,126
Captain!

800
01:04:58,730 --> 01:05:00,901
Captain Hitsugaya!

801
01:05:09,220 --> 01:05:10,140
Toushirou!

802
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:12,100
Heads up, Kurosaki.

803
01:05:12,100 --> 01:05:13,413
He's coming.

804
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:37,040
It's mine at last!

805
01:05:37,040 --> 01:05:41,512
So this is the power of the King's Seal!

806
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:50,745
Kenpachi!

807
01:06:03,990 --> 01:06:05,426
Over already?

808
01:06:05,450 --> 01:06:07,686
Guess you were all talk—

809
01:06:10,070 --> 01:06:11,461
What?

810
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:21,320
Your attacks...

811
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:25,181
are useless against me!

812
01:06:26,270 --> 01:06:28,300
You aren't dead yet?

813
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:30,952
Interesting!

814
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:38,310
You're mine!

815
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,689
It's useless!

816
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:49,764
You're in the way.

817
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,770
Amazing.

818
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:30,333
This is an amazing power!

819
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:33,476
What's that?

820
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:37,907
They're... Kusaka's...!

821
01:07:38,410 --> 01:07:41,026
Why are you in such terrible condition?

822
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,966
Don't tell me you ran away?

823
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:46,156
We have no excuse.

824
01:07:46,180 --> 01:07:48,806
Well, that's fine.

825
01:07:49,100 --> 01:07:50,907
No!

826
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:01,397
Is he transforming again?!

827
01:08:27,540 --> 01:08:29,766
Do not be afraid!

828
01:08:29,790 --> 01:08:31,510
Stand your ground!

829
01:08:31,510 --> 01:08:35,166
The criminal, Kusaka Sojiro, must be eliminated!

830
01:08:35,190 --> 01:08:36,893
Yes!

831
01:08:44,410 --> 01:08:45,140
Let's go.

832
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:47,064
Ichigo!

833
01:08:51,890 --> 01:08:53,502
Captain!

834
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:58,280
Scatter,

835
01:08:58,280 --> 01:08:59,480
Senbonzakura.

836
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,646
Senbonzakura (千本桜): A Thousand Cherry Blossoms

837
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,570
Howl, Zabimaru!

838
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:09,937
Zabimaru (蛇尾丸): The Snaketail

839
01:09:22,670 --> 01:09:25,920
You're in the way!

840
01:09:39,590 --> 01:09:41,716
Th-this is...?

841
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:44,196
Just what is going on?

842
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:47,200
Did he release the full power of the King's Seal?

843
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:48,550
Not quite.

844
01:09:48,550 --> 01:09:50,960
The King's Seal is just rampaging.

845
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:52,626
It's what?

846
01:09:52,650 --> 01:09:53,460
Look,

847
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:56,980
The reiatsu grows stronger and expands.

848
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,040
If it continues like this,

849
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:02,376
he'll annihilate all of Seireitei.

850
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,030
Annihilation?

851
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:07,996
It may be powerful, but isn't that a bit much...

852
01:10:08,020 --> 01:10:10,320
The King's Seal is an weapon from another dimension,

853
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:19,256
Born in a place with complete dominion over time, space, and the infinite dimensions.

854
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:20,560
In other words,

855
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:30,976
in a contained area, the wielder becomes a god, to whom death and rebirth are trivial matters.

856
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:31,740
But.

857
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:36,200
Since Kusaka doesn't have control of his Bankai, using it to that extent is impossible.

858
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:37,120
That is to say...

859
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:42,762
We are in the most dangerous of situations at the moment.

860
01:11:01,570 --> 01:11:02,846
Matsumoto?

861
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:04,989
I'm okay.

862
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:09,966
Matsumoto!

863
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:12,740
Protecting the Captain's back...

864
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:16,426
is the Vice-Captain's job.

865
01:11:16,450 --> 01:11:18,360
Ow, ow, ow.

866
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,996
Are you alright, Rukia?

867
01:11:21,020 --> 01:11:23,191
I'm fine.

868
01:11:23,500 --> 01:11:25,160
Hey, Toushirou.

869
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:27,936
So you guys made it through too?

870
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:30,206
Rukia, Ichigo!

871
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:31,760
Renji, what is it?

872
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,300
What's it look like...

873
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,979
Look around.

874
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,780
You could call that Kusaka's castle.

875
01:11:42,780 --> 01:11:47,676
And it looks like we're stuck inside his spirit barrier?

876
01:11:47,700 --> 01:11:49,100
What should we do?

877
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,869
Like I'd know.

878
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:53,910
Ichigo!

879
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,743
Yoruichi-san!

880
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:58,276
We don't have much time!

881
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:02,356
The Captain-Commander is preventing this dimension from expanding any further.

882
01:12:02,380 --> 01:12:05,896
Our job is to defeat Kusaka before that happens.

883
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:07,470
But, how?

884
01:12:07,470 --> 01:12:09,756
You can climb, can't you?

885
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:10,956
Eh?

886
01:12:10,980 --> 01:12:11,750
And,

887
01:12:11,750 --> 01:12:15,988
We must cut down the core of that tower.

888
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:16,920
Now,

889
01:12:16,920 --> 01:12:19,806
We should attack immediately, while he's immobile.

890
01:12:19,830 --> 01:12:20,730
Right.

891
01:12:20,730 --> 01:12:23,109
Wait a sec!

892
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:26,180
The real party's about to start, eh?

893
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,770
I'd better be invited.

894
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:31,383
Me too, of course.

895
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:36,800
It's begun?

896
01:12:39,470 --> 01:12:41,537
Hollows?

897
01:12:42,370 --> 01:12:45,736
Don't bother! Leave this to us!

898
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:46,986
Yoruichi-san!

899
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:48,270
Soifon, let's go!

900
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:49,570
Yes!

901
01:12:49,570 --> 01:12:51,624
Shunkou!
- Shunkou!

902
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:10,590
We need to reach the pinnacle.

903
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:12,228
Yeah.

904
01:13:12,260 --> 01:13:14,080
Captain.

905
01:13:14,810 --> 01:13:16,422
Take this.

906
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:35,040
Matsumoto.

907
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,470
Yes.

908
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:39,386
Watch my back.

909
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:41,191
Yes!

910
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,286
We'll split into two groups.

911
01:13:49,310 --> 01:13:52,006
Alright. Let's go, Renji, Rukia!

912
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:52,660
Alright!

913
01:13:52,660 --> 01:13:54,720
I'm stuck with you two again?

914
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:57,424
Shut it.

915
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:03,808
What's that?

916
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:07,890
That flame is..?

917
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:08,780
Leave her to me!

918
01:14:08,780 --> 01:14:09,220
Hey!

919
01:14:09,220 --> 01:14:10,190
Howl!

920
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:13,102
Zabimaru!

921
01:14:18,810 --> 01:14:20,123
Renji!
- Renji!

922
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:26,508
Bankai.

923
01:14:28,710 --> 01:14:33,624
Baboon King, Zabimaru!

924
01:14:34,950 --> 01:14:37,986
Nothing's gonna happen if you waste your time here!

925
01:14:38,010 --> 01:14:40,630
Use Zabimaru as a ladder and climb up!

926
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:43,061
Got it.

927
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:53,594
She's here!

928
01:15:17,320 --> 01:15:19,526
Soifon. Now!

929
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:21,552
 I'll take her down!

930
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:27,160
Sting all enemies to death! Suzumebachi!

931
01:15:24,430 --> 01:15:27,896
Suzumebachi (雀蜂): Hornet

932
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,572
The second fatal blow!

933
01:15:34,580 --> 01:15:37,869
She did it?

934
01:15:47,730 --> 01:15:50,239
High-speed regeneration?!

935
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:58,600
Matsumoto!

936
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:09,696
Is this beast moving?

937
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:12,206
Nope, not quite.

938
01:16:12,230 --> 01:16:14,726
This reiatsu is...!

939
01:16:21,870 --> 01:16:24,145
Now it's getting interesting!

940
01:16:28,150 --> 01:16:30,256
Captain!

941
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:32,666
Outta my way!

942
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,861
Hurry upwards!

943
01:16:49,090 --> 01:16:50,000
Now!

944
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:50,884
Right!

945
01:17:08,770 --> 01:17:13,411
They've even summoned Menos?

946
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:23,903
Bankai!

947
01:17:32,670 --> 01:17:34,620
Haineko!

948
01:17:37,740 --> 01:17:39,336
Just a bit more!

949
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:42,194
If we could just break through!

950
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,540
Dance!

951
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:45,790
Sode no Shirayuki!

952
01:17:44,540 --> 01:17:46,716
Sode no Shirayuki (袖白雪): White Snow on the Sleeves

953
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,885
The next dance...

954
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,190
Hakuren!

955
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:56,017
Hakuren (白漣): White Ripples

956
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,330
Damn you.

957
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,526
Ichigo.

958
01:18:21,650 --> 01:18:24,286
Ichigo, do you see that tower?

959
01:18:24,310 --> 01:18:25,402
Yeah.

960
01:18:26,290 --> 01:18:32,646
If we open a path for a moment, can you get to the top of that tower with Tensa Zangetsu's speed?

961
01:18:32,670 --> 01:18:34,036
What?

962
01:18:34,060 --> 01:18:35,706
That's the only way!

963
01:18:35,730 --> 01:18:38,900
If Ikkaku, Yumichika, and I join our powers,

964
01:18:38,900 --> 01:18:41,630
We should be able to open up a path, if only for an instant.

965
01:18:41,630 --> 01:18:42,936
But...

966
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,786
I heard that!

967
01:18:44,810 --> 01:18:46,230
But, Matsumoto.

968
01:18:46,230 --> 01:18:50,962
To make a path, I'll be enough.

969
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:53,856
You're gonna do it, Ikkaku?

970
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:55,506
Yeah!

971
01:18:55,530 --> 01:18:57,490
Captain Hitsugaya, Matsumoto!

972
01:18:57,490 --> 01:19:00,316
Keep this a secret from everyone else!

973
01:19:00,340 --> 01:19:04,344
Bankai!

974
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:20,760
Ryuumon Houzukimaru!

975
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:22,892
Ryuumon Houzukimaru (龍紋鬼灯丸): Dragon-crested Demon Light

976
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:35,729
The first dance,

977
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:36,830
Tsukishiro!

978
01:19:35,880 --> 01:19:37,817
Tsukishiro (月白): White Moon

979
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:51,816
Bastards!

980
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,595
What?

981
01:19:56,970 --> 01:19:58,790
This is bad!

982
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:12,710
Prepare yourselves.

983
01:20:12,710 --> 01:20:13,550
Byakuya!

984
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:19,361
The Captain-Commander and the others outside are under pressure.

985
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,366
Kurosaki Ichigo.

986
01:20:28,390 --> 01:20:29,820
Make haste.

987
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,386
Renji!

988
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:34,191
Yeah.

989
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:39,010
Senkei Senbonzakura Kageyoshi!

990
01:20:35,020 --> 01:20:42,092
Senkei Senbonzakura Kageyoshi (殲景 千本桜景厳): Annihilate,  Vibrant Display of a Thousand Cherry Blossoms

991
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:50,620
Hikotsu Taihou!

992
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:52,551
Hikotsu Taihou (狒骨大砲): Baboon Bone Cannon

993
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:35,330
Daiguren Hyourinmaru!

994
01:21:32,570 --> 01:21:37,562
Daiguren Hyourinmaru (大紅蓮氷輪丸): The Icy Moon of Mahapadma

995
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:12,234
Getsuga Tenshou!

996
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:22,493
Ichigo.

997
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:50,445
You did it, Ichigo.

998
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,586
Finish this, Toushirou.

999
01:23:26,380 --> 01:23:28,707
Hitsugaya.

1000
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:32,000
Let's end this.

1001
01:23:34,560 --> 01:23:38,018
Yes, that's right...

1002
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,210
We don't need two shinigami!

1003
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:03,246
We must choose one!

1004
01:24:03,270 --> 01:24:04,610
Unnecessary! Unacceptable!

1005
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:08,486
Fight! Fight!

1006
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:10,306
Hitsugaya!

1007
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:12,440
I want Hyourinmaru!

1008
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,209
Kusaka, stop!

1009
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:46,820
You truly are a prodigy.

1010
01:24:46,820 --> 01:24:52,774
Since you could match and kill me.

1011
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:55,800
But I won't die.

1012
01:24:55,800 --> 01:25:01,858
I will, my existence will...

1013
01:25:01,940 --> 01:25:03,695
Kusaka...

1014
01:25:04,310 --> 01:25:06,871
You'll always...

1015
01:25:07,060 --> 01:25:09,114
...be my friend.

1016
01:25:09,370 --> 01:25:16,676
If I... can be considered one.

1017
01:25:20,310 --> 01:25:23,131
"If"?

1018
01:25:35,770 --> 01:25:37,976
Seems like it's over.

1019
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:40,067
Onii-sama.

1020
01:25:44,190 --> 01:25:45,620
Hey?

1021
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,880
Who won?

1022
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,792
You fool.

1023
01:25:51,030 --> 01:25:53,461
Can't you tell?

1024
01:26:18,900 --> 01:26:23,099
Something this small...

1025
01:26:32,780 --> 01:26:37,005
You have my thanks, Kurosaki.

1026
01:26:37,060 --> 01:26:38,646
So that guy,

1027
01:26:38,670 --> 01:26:42,167
I wonder if he has any regrets?

1028
01:26:43,140 --> 01:26:47,326
Since he managed to finally settle this with you.

1029
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:49,906
During life,

1030
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:54,285
unfinished business clouds our purpose.

1031
01:26:54,310 --> 01:27:00,366
But it's up to you to peer through the illusion.

1032
01:27:00,390 --> 01:27:04,466
You ended up here by your own choosing.

1033
01:27:04,490 --> 01:27:11,106
This battle and its purpose were settled by you, and you alone.

1034
01:27:11,130 --> 01:27:12,576
Then,

1035
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:15,590
That's good, right?

1036
01:27:16,680 --> 01:27:21,191
Though I, for one, could have done without this mess.

1037
01:27:24,710 --> 01:27:26,710
Let's go back now.

1038
01:27:26,710 --> 01:27:28,855
Yes.

1039
01:27:33,340 --> 01:27:39,026
Not Toushirou, it's Captain Hitsugaya.

1040
01:27:39,050 --> 01:27:40,831
Let's go.

{\be1}nothing changes for us, right?

1123
01:31:57,100 --> 01:31:58,764
See you.

1124
01:31:59,630 --> 01:32:00,420
Matsumoto.

1125
01:32:00,420 --> 01:32:02,019
Yes?

1126
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:06,386
Sorry about everything... and thank you.

1127
01:32:06,410 --> 01:32:07,920
What did you just say Captain?

1128
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,506
I didn't say a thing.

1129
01:32:09,530 --> 01:32:10,290
Let's head back now.

1130
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:12,650
Eh? Do we have to?

1131
01:32:12,650 --> 01:32:14,690
How about we call it a day instead?

1132
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:17,420
We could go to a really fantastic hot spring near here!

1133
01:32:17,420 --> 01:32:18,520
You can go, alone.

1134
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:20,380
I can't go by myself!

1135
01:32:20,380 --> 01:32:21,356
Don't say that! Hey, come on!

1136
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:23,408
Stop!

1136
01:32:24,305 --> 01:33:24,670
