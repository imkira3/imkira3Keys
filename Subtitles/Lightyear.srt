2
00:01:42,895 --> 00:01:45,939
Buzz Light year mission log,
star date 3901.

3
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:48,150
Sensors have detected
potential life forms...

4
00:01:48,317 --> 00:01:49,443
on an uncharted planet.

5
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,612
So, we're making a detour to investigate.

6
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:01,997
Space rangers
will make initial evaluation...

7
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:04,350
then assess whether it's worth
waking the science crew...

8
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,459
from their hyper sleep.

9
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,295
While the ERIC takes core samples...

10
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:13,258
I will explore further the oddities
of this strange planet.

11
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:30,901
Terrain seems a bit unstable.

12
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,612
No readout yet if the air is breathable.

13
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:36,823
There seems to be
no sign of intelligent life anywhere.

14
00:02:37,032 --> 00:02:38,700
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

15
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,202
You were narrating again.

16
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:42,871
I was not. Just doing the mission log.

17
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,290
You do know no one ever listens to those.

18
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,793
I know that. Narrating helps me focus.

19
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:49,586
- Stay sharp.
- Yeah.

20
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,964
Well, if it bothers you,
Commander Hawthorne...

21
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,674
I'm happy to wait back on the turnip.

22
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:55,175
Please don't call it the turnip.

23
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:57,052
But the ship looks like a root vegetable.

24
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,264
Yes. You made that very clear
at the design review.

25
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,835
How long have you known that I narrate?

26
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,944
Forever. Since you and I were cadets.

27
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,196
Speaking of, you forgot to
take the rookie with you.

28
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:19,616
Commander Hawthorne,
you know how I feel about rookies.

29
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,493
The same way I feel about autopilots.

30
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,288
"How may I assist you?
Is there anything I can do, sir?"

31
00:03:24,413 --> 00:03:26,540
They don't help.
They just overcomplicate things.

32
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm better off just doing the job myself.

33
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,252
Which is why I brought the rookie.

34
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,713
Hello.

35
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,883
- No.
- Buzz, protocol requires we bring him along.

36
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,409
- He's gonna have sad eyes.
- Buzz.

37
00:03:37,509 --> 00:03:38,949
You know I can't deal with sad eyes.

38
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,280
- Look at the rookie, Buzz.
- Nope.

39
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,805
- Look at the... Look...
- No... No.

40
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:42,890
- Light year.
- No.

41
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,176
- Look at him.
- Not looking.

42
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:44,975
- Look.
- No.

43
00:03:45,142 --> 00:03:47,436
- Look, look, look. Look at the rookie.
- No, no, no.

44
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:53,066
All right. All right. You win.

45
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,654
Look, Feather... Featherings... Feather...

46
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:58,798
It's Featheringhamstan, sir.

47
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:01,074
Look, rookie. First, you will not speak
unless spoken to.

48
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:02,343
- Yes, sir.
- Still talking.

49
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,161
Second, respect the suit.

50
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:06,079
This suit means something.

51
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:09,082
It's not just protecting your body.
It's protecting the universe.

52
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:13,629
This suit is a promise to the world that you
and you alone will do one thing above all.

53
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,839
Finish the mission, no matter the cost.

54
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,842
You will never quit, whatever the galaxy
may throw your way.

55
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:20,552
Will you please turn that off!

56
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:22,971
It's just too easy.

57
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,098
You're mocking me, aren't you?

58
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,392
Yeah, but in a supportive way.

59
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,681
Look, what I'm trying to say, Commander,
is that you and I have this job down.

60
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:31,897
- Sir.
- Still talking.

61
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:34,834
At any moment I know what you're thinking,
I know where you're gonna be.

62
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,318
But this guy, I don't know.

63
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:37,569
Where'd he go?

64
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,155
You see,
this is exactly what I'm talking about.

65
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,823
He's not helping. He's wandered off.

66
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,700
Vines!

67
00:04:52,918 --> 00:04:53,919
Bugs!

68
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,052
The ship. It's sinking.

69
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,512
Everyone, back to the turnip!

70
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,013
Oh, so now it's the turnip.

71
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:16,608
Engage stealth mode.
It should buy us enough time.

72
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,489
We're not gonna make it.

73
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:23,991
Almost there!

74
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,619
Okay, plan B. Ready?

75
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:28,786
Go!

76
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,555
- Blast!
- Here. I can reroute it.

77
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:47,805
Just gimme a minute.

78
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,099
Where is the...

79
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:50,517
Help!

80
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:53,896
Rookie.

81
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,314
Help me!

82
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:59,151
Buzz Light year mission log.
Planet clearly uninhabitable.

83
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:00,777
In fact, outright hostile.

84
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:04,364
Sentient foliage have apprehended
Cadet Furth-Feathering...

85
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:05,693
Featheringston... Feather...

86
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,244
They got the rookie, who I strongly suggested
should not have joined in the first...

87
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:12,372
Blast.

88
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,588
- Buzz!
- Now!

89
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:34,937
Move it, ranger!

90
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:39,149
Making our way back to the ship.

91
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,692
Come on, Buzz!

92
00:06:42,236 --> 00:06:43,737
Hurry!

93
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,406
I'll go to the engine room.

94
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:51,721
- I'll take the helm.
- And I will...

95
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,871
Do nothing. I've got this.

96
00:07:03,966 --> 00:07:05,300
How may I assist you?

97
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,384
Autopilots.

98
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,029
- Is there anything I can do, sir?
- No and no!

99
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,053
This is not a simulation.

100
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:12,724
Commander, status!

101
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:13,725
Fuel engaged.

102
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:14,893
All systems go.

103
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:23,610
Warning. Launch trajectory unsound.

104
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,448
Come on. Come on.

105
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,660
Collision imminent.

106
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:33,161
Abort. Abort. Abort...

107
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,671
Captain Light year, do you need my help?

108
00:07:42,838 --> 00:07:44,214
- Negative.
- Are you sure?

109
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,009
I'm Buzz Light year. I'm always sure.

110
00:08:28,258 --> 00:08:29,468
It's bad, Buzz.

111
00:08:31,637 --> 00:08:34,515
Our hyper-speed crystal
was totally destroyed.

112
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,393
Long story short. We're marooned.

113
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:39,728
I don't know.

114
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,398
What are you doing?

115
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:44,775
I'm court-martialing myself.

116
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:45,943
No, you're not.

117
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:49,571
Commander Hawthorne, I hereby
relieve myself of all space ranger duties.

118
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,074
This was my fault,
and these people deserve better.

119
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,867
You can throw me in the brig.

120
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,370
Finish the mission, Buzz.

121
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:57,663
That's what we do.

122
00:08:57,829 --> 00:09:00,123
We're not done until everyone gets home.

123
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,792
But we have no fuel crystal.

124
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,753
So we mine the resources on this planet.
Create a new crystal.

125
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,630
Crystallic fusion is highly unstable.

126
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:07,797
Then we test it.

127
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,633
No. It's too dangerous.

128
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,010
Manufacturing a crystal
capable of hyper speed...

129
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,305
is like trying to lasso the sun.

130
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:18,725
And then someone would need
to attach that sun to a ship...

131
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:23,021
and then that ship needs someone to fly it
without blowing themselves into oblivion.

132
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,065
Who in their right mind would...

133
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,317
Oh...

134
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,369
Buzz Light year mission
log, star date 3902.

135
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,830
After a full year of being marooned...

136
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:44,084
our specialized crew have put this planet's
vast resources to incredible use.

137
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,591
Finally, our first hyper-speed test flight
is a go.

138
00:10:09,651 --> 00:10:10,691
Ready, Captain Light year?

139
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:13,113
Ready as I'll ever be, Commander Hawthorne.

140
00:10:13,197 --> 00:10:14,198
To infinity.

141
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,449
And beyond.

142
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:20,370
- Buzz!
- We got a breach in the perimeter.

143
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:25,667
Come on, I just...

144
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:26,834
Captain Light year!

145
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,128
Airman Díaz.

146
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:30,506
Boy, the vines are
a little feisty today, huh?

147
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,715
Are we ready to launch?

148
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:33,592
We're all ready if you are, sir.

149
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,971
A year of work for a four-minute flight.
Isn't that something?

150
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,139
Sure is.

151
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:41,808
Well, let's go find out
if this new hyper-speed fuel is stable.

152
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:43,810
So I can get us off this rock.

153
00:10:44,311 --> 00:10:46,396
Almost forgot. Here's your I.V.A.N., sir.

154
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:47,564
Fully loaded.

155
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,191
Autopilots.

156
00:10:49,358 --> 00:10:51,777
And here of course is the XL-01.

157
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,946
Pretty sweet ride.

158
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,823
Now let's get you that fuel crystal.

159
00:10:56,949 --> 00:10:58,992
Good morning, Captain Light year.

160
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,957
Here is your specially formulated
fuel mixture.

161
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,044
So this is the fuel
that's gonna reach hyper speed?

162
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:11,588
It has an 87.6% chance.

163
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,382
I'll take those odds.

164
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:22,099
Good luck, Captain.

165
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,059
We're all counting on you...

166
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,477
Airman.

167
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:36,697
XL-01 to mission control. Do you copy?

168
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:37,990
Copy XL-01.

169
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,238
I'm gonna grant you four minutes
to be off-planet...

170
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,119
but then you come right back to us.

171
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,286
That's an order.

172
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:44,454
Roger that.

173
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:46,540
Hyper speed, here I come.

174
00:11:46,748 --> 00:11:48,000
T minus ten...

175
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,334
nine...

176
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,211
eight, seven...

177
00:11:51,587 --> 00:11:52,587
six...

178
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,256
five, four...

179
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,341
three, two...

180
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,177
one. Launch.

181
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:24,464
I.V.A.N., pull up the flight plan, please.

182
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,579
Hello.

183
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:27,873
Autopilots.

184
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,088
Hello, I am your Internal
Voice-Activated Navigator. Call me I.V.A.N.

185
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,815
Ready the flight plan, please, I.V.A.N.

186
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:37,883
Certainly.

187
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,135
Your mission is to accelerate
through deep space...

188
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,221
slingshot around Alpha T'kani...

189
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:46,058
then through the deceleration rings
back here to T'kani Prime.

190
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,436
Target flight time, 4 minutes, 28 seconds.

191
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,897
XL-01, you are clear for hyper launch.

192
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:54,358
Copy, Control. Initiating hyper launch.

193
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:20,968
Approaching 50% hyper speed.

194
00:13:26,557 --> 00:13:27,557
Fuel stable.

195
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,727
Increasing speed to 0.6c.

196
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,858
60% hyper speed.

197
00:13:43,115 --> 00:13:46,493
Increasing speed to 0.7c.

198
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:52,791
70% hyper speed.

199
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,084
Fuel stable.

200
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,714
Approaching 0.8c.

201
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,424
Pushing to hyper speed.

202
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,595
Failure in engine one.

203
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:07,764
Fuel cell unstable.

204
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:08,765
I.V.A.N., status.

205
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:11,268
Trajectory error, plus four degrees.

206
00:14:11,393 --> 00:14:13,979
Failure to course correct
will result in missing the rings.

207
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,190
We'll fly off into deep space...

208
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,566
resulting in certain death.

209
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:19,067
Yes, thank you.

210
00:14:19,193 --> 00:14:20,777
Ejection is your only option.

211
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,696
No, no. I can do it.

212
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:27,159
Warning.
You have 26 seconds to course correct.

213
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,412
You now have 25 seconds to course correct.

214
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,219
- You now have...
- Stop counting, please.

215
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:35,626
I'm sorry. My safety protocols prohibit me
from terminating countdown.

216
00:14:35,792 --> 00:14:36,835
Autopilots.

217
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,713
Mission failure imminent,
please record your last words.

218
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:41,381
Not today, I.V.A.N.

219
00:14:41,507 --> 00:14:42,758
Not today, I.V.A.N.

220
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,928
If you are satisfied with this recording,
speak or select one.

221
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,680
I.V.A.N., push the engines all the way.
Maximum power.

222
00:14:48,931 --> 00:14:51,808
That action is inadvisable.
Fuel cell detonation...

223
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,977
Is exactly what I'm counting on.

224
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,024
Situation critical.

225
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:02,945
Fuel cell approaching peak capacity.

226
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,404
Open the fuel door, I.V.A.N.

227
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,156
I'm sorry. I didn't quite catch that.

228
00:15:06,323 --> 00:15:08,575
- Please restate your command.
- Open fuel door!

229
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:12,579
Detonation in five...

230
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:13,746
four...

231
00:15:13,789 --> 00:15:15,040
three...

232
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,458
two...

233
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,583
- one.
- Now!

234
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,391
Course corrected.

235
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,268
You failed to reach hyper speed.

236
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:36,079
Didn't need to hear that, I.V.A.N.

237
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,103
You didn't hear that.

238
00:15:37,229 --> 00:15:38,230
I'm sorry. I'll repeat.

239
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,750
- No. I heard. I meant I didn't need to...
- You failed to reach hyper speed.

240
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,214
- Thank you, I.V.A.N.
- You failed...

241
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:06,133
Commander, are you okay?

242
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,303
Díaz, you grew a beard.

243
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,637
How did you grow a beard?

244
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:11,805
Oh, right.

245
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,640
First off, welcome back.

246
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:15,851
Secondly...

247
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:17,059
Wait.

248
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:19,354
Wait, what is this?

249
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,023
How long was I gone?

250
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:23,192
Four years, two months, and three days.

251
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,693
What?

252
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:26,111
Thought we'd lost you, Buzz.

253
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,447
Alisha, what happened?

254
00:16:28,739 --> 00:16:30,574
- Time dilation.
- What?

255
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,659
Time dilation is quite simple.

256
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:36,705
As you approached hyper speed,
your time slowed relative to our own.

257
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,208
So, during your mission,
you aged only minutes...

258
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,251
while the rest of us have aged years.

259
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:43,086
Simply put, the faster you fly...

260
00:16:43,212 --> 00:16:46,548
The faster I fly,
the further into the future I travel.

261
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:47,883
I get it.

262
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:53,514
So, what are we gonna do now?

263
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:54,765
I don't know.

264
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:57,434
But I think we should hold off
on any more test flights...

265
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,394
until we figure out something else.

266
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,730
Commander, we said finish the mission.

267
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,106
That's what space rangers do.

268
00:17:03,273 --> 00:17:04,691
At what cost, Buzz?

269
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:07,319
Are you willing to lose another four years?

270
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:15,953
So, everyone's just stuck here...

271
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,163
because of me.

272
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:30,300
Hey. You all right?

273
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,095
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

274
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,430
Wait, what's that?

275
00:17:36,014 --> 00:17:37,850
Oh. I got engaged.

276
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,811
Wow. That's great. What's her name?

277
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,605
Kiko. She's one of the science crew.

278
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:47,734
It's funny. I never would have met her
if we hadn't been stranded.

279
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:50,112
You got engaged to someone you just met?

280
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:52,990
Buzz, I met her three years ago.

281
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,409
Oh, right. Right.

282
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,012
Well, congratulations.
I'd love to meet her.

283
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,581
Well, there's plenty of time for that.
Get some rest.

284
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:03,333
That's an order.

285
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:27,732
Hello, Buzz!

286
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,528
I am Sox. Your personal companion robot.

287
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:32,612
My what?

288
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:33,936
I was issued by Star Command...

289
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:37,117
to ease your emotional transition
after your time away.

290
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:40,913
Well, that's very considerate of you,
robot feline.

291
00:18:41,121 --> 00:18:42,331
But no, thank you.

292
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,249
I'm afraid it's protocol.

293
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:47,419
Sensors indicate
you've missed four birthdays.

294
00:18:47,586 --> 00:18:49,506
Would you like a frosted snack cake
to celebrate?

295
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,341
Negative. That would
compromise my nutritional regimen.

296
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:57,930
We can talk about your feelings.
I am an excellent listener.

297
00:18:58,222 --> 00:19:02,309
No, no. Look, I've had a very long... day?

298
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,727
It did not go as planned.

299
00:19:03,852 --> 00:19:05,771
The mission was unsuccessful?

300
00:19:06,230 --> 00:19:07,356
Affirmative.

301
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:10,984
Oh, no. I am so sorry to hear that.

302
00:19:11,693 --> 00:19:12,945
Thank you, Sox.

303
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,404
You're welcome, Buzz.

304
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:15,989
Shall we play a game?

305
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,438
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure?

306
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:20,911
I can create a game specifically for you
based on your exact personality profile.

307
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,622
Hey, listen. Sox,
buddy, I'm pretty tired...

308
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:26,291
so I'm gonna go ahead and hit the rack.

309
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:27,918
Of course.

310
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,965
I can provide sleep sounds, if you like.

311
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,675
I have several options.

312
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,261
Summer night, ocean paradise, whale calls?

313
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:39,304
No, no. White noise is fine.

314
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,430
Very well.

315
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:42,140
- Good night, Sox.
- Good night, Buzz.

316
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:49,106
Pull up. Pull up.

317
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,692
Pull up. Pull up.

318
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:53,584
Captain Light year, do you need my help?

319
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:54,695
No. I can do it.

320
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,821
Buzz, are you sure?

321
00:19:55,988 --> 00:19:57,322
I'm afraid it's protocol.

322
00:19:57,614 --> 00:19:58,740
I can do it!

323
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,743
I can do it.

324
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,996
Sensors indicate you had a nightmare.

325
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:06,623
- Would you like to talk about it?
- Negative.

326
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:09,418
Okay. But remember,
my mission is to help you.

327
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,025
And I'm not giving up on my mission.

328
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,421
Yeah?

329
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:14,298
Yeah.

330
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:17,384
You know what, Sox?
I'm not giving up on my mission either.

331
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:19,720
Great! So, what can I do?

332
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,265
Well, why don't you engage
with your mouse buddy.

333
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:26,894
Is there anything more challenging?

334
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,437
You want a challenge? Okay.

335
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,106
I guess you could work
on this fuel stability thing.

336
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,610
Crystallic fusion. Of course.

337
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:36,069
When should I expect you back?

338
00:20:36,737 --> 00:20:38,071
About four years.

339
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:41,825
Hold on. You don't have to do this.

340
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,660
Commander, this is my mistake.

341
00:20:43,785 --> 00:20:45,037
I need to make it right.

342
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:47,456
Okay. But maybe we should think about this.

343
00:20:47,664 --> 00:20:50,292
Think about what?
Come on, we're space rangers.

344
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:52,044
We finish the mission.

345
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:55,589
Well, it would be nice
to wear the suit again.

346
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,300
People are starting to forget
space rangers ever mattered.

347
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,677
Well, I'm about to fix that.

348
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,095
To infinity.

349
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:03,764
And beyond.

350
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:55,709
Hi, Buzz.

351
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,963
You'll be back here in a year or two...

352
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:03,926
and, well, I won't.

353
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:06,428
I don't know when it happened...

354
00:23:06,595 --> 00:23:10,557
but I seem to have
gone and gotten very old.

355
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:15,145
I always thought we'd get
to be space rangers again.

356
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:19,274
I miss being out among the stars.

357
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:21,360
All the adventures.

358
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,989
But more than any of that...

359
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:28,242
I missed you.

360
00:23:30,702 --> 00:23:31,828
Hi, Grandma.

361
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,623
Hey, sweetheart.

362
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:37,459
I'm leaving a message for my friend Buzz.

363
00:23:37,668 --> 00:23:38,669
The space ranger?

364
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,754
That's right.

365
00:23:40,963 --> 00:23:42,631
He's in space right now.

366
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:43,841
Wow.

367
00:23:43,966 --> 00:23:46,093
This is my granddaughter, Izzy.

368
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,220
I'm gonna be a space ranger too.

369
00:23:48,387 --> 00:23:49,388
Just like him?

370
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:50,931
Just like you.

371
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,728
Goodbye, Buzz.

372
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:01,191
I'm sorry I won't be there
to see you finish the mission.

373
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,571
To infinity.

374
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,449
And beyond.

375
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,196
Knock-knock. Sorry to interrupt.
I'm just movin' into my new...

376
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:52,784
Look at that!
The actual Buzz Light year in the flesh.

377
00:24:52,951 --> 00:24:53,952
Affirmative.

378
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:55,495
Commander Cal Burnside.

379
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,372
I was a big fan of yours when I was a kid.

380
00:24:57,581 --> 00:25:01,585
Well, then I look forward to working
with you to finally get us outta here.

381
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:04,379
Oh, did no one tell you?

382
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:05,756
Tell me what?

383
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:07,132
Yeah.

384
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:10,260
That was the last mission, Buzz.

385
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:11,470
What?

386
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:13,615
We've decided we're gonna go ahead
and stay right here.

387
00:25:13,639 --> 00:25:15,974
Wait, here? Negative.
That is not a viable option.

388
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,061
It is now. See, we're building this.

389
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,105
Laser-shield!

390
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,525
It'll keep all the critters out.

391
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,903
And we'll just tuck right in here
and make do with what we've got.

392
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:30,864
Make do? No, wait, wait,
but you don't understand, Commander.

393
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:33,492
I can still do it.
I can get us outta here.

394
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,619
Man, it's great you still believe that.

395
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:36,954
But we're good, Buzz.

396
00:25:37,037 --> 00:25:38,997
Got the laser-shield.

397
00:25:44,253 --> 00:25:45,754
Oh. Hello, Buzz.

398
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:48,590
Buzz?

399
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,639
Oh, well, I've got some good news, Buzz.

400
00:25:56,265 --> 00:25:58,141
I figured out the fuel problem.

401
00:25:58,517 --> 00:25:59,643
What?

402
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,603
It was an interesting combination.

403
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:04,439
Just the slightest variance,
but it made all the difference.

404
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,234
Sox, how did you do this?

405
00:26:07,401 --> 00:26:11,488
It took me 62 years, 7 months, and 5 days.

406
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:13,073
And it's stable?

407
00:26:13,198 --> 00:26:14,241
Theoretically.

408
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,828
I look forward to finding out
on your next mission.

409
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:20,289
Yeah...

410
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,960
What?

411
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:27,546
Evening, Captain.
We're here to pick up your companion robot.

412
00:26:28,005 --> 00:26:29,089
What do you mean?

413
00:26:29,256 --> 00:26:31,592
Security purposes. You understand.

414
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,468
No, actually, I don't.

415
00:26:33,677 --> 00:26:36,930
Shutting down the program,
so we have to decommission your cat.

416
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:38,265
It'll just take a second.

417
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:39,850
Now, hold on. Just...

418
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,063
At least let me do it.

419
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,200
What?

420
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,165
Buzz. Where are we going?

421
00:27:03,332 --> 00:27:04,333
We're going to space.

422
00:27:04,499 --> 00:27:05,626
What?

423
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:08,837
Buzz Light year mission log, star date...

424
00:27:09,004 --> 00:27:10,005
I have no idea.

425
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,216
In possession of stable fuel formula.

426
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,185
I plan to reach hyper speed and this time,
finally finish the mission.

427
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,678
Who you talking to?

428
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:17,846
Doesn't matter.

429
00:27:18,555 --> 00:27:21,433
My programming compels me to notify
Star Command that you have gone...

430
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,242
Star Command was gonna decommission you.

431
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,352
- What?
- That's right.

432
00:27:24,436 --> 00:27:26,188
Lights out. No more Sox.

433
00:27:27,523 --> 00:27:29,403
Hey! You're not authorized
to be in this area...

434
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,612
Whoa, I didn't know you could do that.

435
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,114
Wait a minute, was that for me?
In case I got out of line?

436
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,407
I bought you five minutes.

437
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:54,842
- All right, Sox. Give me the first one.
- Roger.

438
00:28:11,316 --> 00:28:12,943
Okay. Here goes.

439
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:17,698
Whoa.

440
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,244
The formula!

441
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,063
Tango to base. Tango to base.
Security breach in the launch bay.

442
00:28:50,397 --> 00:28:51,397
Blast.

443
00:28:51,565 --> 00:28:54,026
We have a guard down.
Repeat, we have a guard down.

444
00:28:57,029 --> 00:28:58,030
Okay.

445
00:28:58,447 --> 00:28:59,281
Hello.

446
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,159
- I'm your Internal Voice-Activated Navigator.
- No! I.V.A.N.! No.

447
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:03,511
- You hear that?
- Call me I.V.A.N.

448
00:29:03,535 --> 00:29:06,079
Mission control,
activity detected in the XL-15.

449
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:07,581
Investigating.

450
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:08,749
Roger that.

451
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:10,626
XL-15, this is control.

452
00:29:10,792 --> 00:29:11,960
Is there someone in there?

453
00:29:12,127 --> 00:29:13,712
- Say something.
- XL-15...

454
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:15,088
please respond.

455
00:29:15,255 --> 00:29:19,092
Copy, control. Just the cleaning crew.
Cleaning crew.

456
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:22,471
We're cleaning the cockpit.
Cleaning items in here?

457
00:29:23,013 --> 00:29:26,475
Commander, did we authorize
a cockpit cleaning for the XL-15?

458
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:28,310
What? No.

459
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:33,649
- Stop! Stop! Come back!
- Hey! Wait!

460
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:38,195
XL-15, you are in violation
of Star Command protocol.

461
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:39,602
Cease your actions immediately.

462
00:29:42,157 --> 00:29:43,575
Open this hatch!

463
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:46,411
Commander, it's Captain Light year.

464
00:29:46,578 --> 00:29:48,872
Wait, what? Light year?
Well, get him outta there!

465
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,626
Stop right now
and put your hands over your head!

466
00:29:57,256 --> 00:29:58,048
Backup.

467
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,777
- We need backup.
- Get the Zap Patrol.

468
00:30:02,594 --> 00:30:03,720
All right, team. Let's go.

469
00:30:07,683 --> 00:30:10,894
Override the silo doors.
He isn't going anywhere.

470
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:14,313
Blast.

471
00:30:14,439 --> 00:30:16,066
Unauthorized. Unauthorized.

472
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:23,049
- Unauthorized. Unauthorized.
- Just, come on, we're sitting ducks here!

473
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,074
Allow me.

474
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,330
- Wait. What's happening?
- He overrode my override.

475
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,539
How?

476
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:45,679
Light year! Light year!

477
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:46,930
I know you can hear me.

478
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,449
Return the ship to base right now...

479
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:49,349
or so help me...

480
00:30:49,474 --> 00:30:52,561
Sox, let's break this hyper-speed barrier
and get everyone home.

481
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:07,701
Approaching 70% hyper speed.

482
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:15,792
Approaching 80% hyper speed.

483
00:31:16,168 --> 00:31:17,252
Fuel stable.

484
00:31:18,962 --> 00:31:21,423
90% hyper speed.

485
00:31:27,971 --> 00:31:31,183
100% hyper speed.

486
00:31:50,035 --> 00:31:51,662
Congratulations, Captain Light year.

487
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,747
You have achieved hyper speed.

488
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,836
We did it. Sox, we did it!

489
00:31:59,044 --> 00:32:00,254
Congratulations, Buzz.

490
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,780
That was utterly terrifying,
and I regret having joined you.

491
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,007
No, no, no.

492
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:07,177
What is it, Buzz?

493
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:08,887
Our velocity is still extremely high.

494
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:10,430
What? What? Oh, no!

495
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:11,640
Are we going to crash?

496
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:12,808
No.

497
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:15,352
Well, technically, yes. Just hang on.

498
00:32:34,705 --> 00:32:37,457
After all these years. Thank you, Sox.

499
00:32:41,879 --> 00:32:43,130
Mission log, supplemental.

500
00:32:43,881 --> 00:32:46,592
After borrowing a ship from Star Command,
I've achieved hyper speed.

501
00:32:46,758 --> 00:32:49,595
And I'm ready to finally leave this planet
once and for all.

502
00:32:51,638 --> 00:32:53,849
Buzz Light year to Star Command.
Come in, Star Command.

503
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,101
Star Command, come in.

504
00:32:56,727 --> 00:32:58,103
Why don't they answer?

505
00:32:58,937 --> 00:32:59,938
Hey, hey!

506
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,148
The robots.

507
00:33:01,523 --> 00:33:02,523
The what?

508
00:33:03,025 --> 00:33:04,735
The robots.

509
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:22,002
Wait, what's it doing?

510
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:23,212
B-Zurg.

511
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,382
- My ship!
- Be quiet.

512
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:28,509
Where'd it go?

513
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:30,511
Up there.

514
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,271
Where is the pilot?

515
00:34:23,772 --> 00:34:25,107
What is that? What is going on?

516
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:26,567
Get down.

517
00:34:29,695 --> 00:34:31,446
Shoot! Come on.

518
00:34:34,992 --> 00:34:36,618
They must've seen your ship land, too.

519
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,328
- Who?
- The robots.

520
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:41,248
Why are there robots?
Where did the robots come from?

521
00:34:41,373 --> 00:34:42,373
Where did you come from?

522
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:43,250
I came from here.

523
00:34:43,375 --> 00:34:44,710
Here? Wait.

524
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:50,549
Buzz?

525
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:53,342
Alisha?

526
00:34:54,094 --> 00:34:56,263
Oh, no, that's my grandmother.
I'm Izzy.

527
00:34:56,471 --> 00:34:57,472
Izzy?

528
00:34:58,557 --> 00:35:00,309
But you were just a little...

529
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,602
Sox, how long were we gone?

530
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:02,728
Meow, meow, meow.

531
00:35:02,895 --> 00:35:05,314
22 years, 19 weeks, and 4 days.

532
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,481
Whoa.

533
00:35:06,607 --> 00:35:07,608
Wait.

534
00:35:09,276 --> 00:35:10,402
Come on.

535
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:13,572
In here.

536
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:19,285
Thought I heard one.

537
00:35:19,494 --> 00:35:20,787
- A robot?
- Yeah.

538
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,331
Impressive.

539
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:24,291
Well, I am a Hawthorne.

540
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,459
You sure are.

541
00:35:25,667 --> 00:35:28,605
You know, your grandma and I could
practically finish each other's sentences.

542
00:35:28,629 --> 00:35:30,829
If you're anything like her,
you and I are gonna make...

543
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:32,466
- a great team.
- ...some robots cry.

544
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:34,593
Okay...

545
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,596
So, get me up to speed on this.

546
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:40,224
Right. The Zurg ship showed up
about a week ago.

547
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,391
What's a Zurg?

548
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:45,312
Oh, well, that's the only thing the robots
say, so that's what we call the big ship.

549
00:35:45,521 --> 00:35:49,566
The Zurg ship arrived, the robots
surrounded the base, and then, well...

550
00:35:49,691 --> 00:35:53,070
Citizens of T'kani Prime,
robot aliens have attacked.

551
00:35:53,237 --> 00:35:54,821
Everyone, inside the perimeter.

552
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:55,988
Look out!

553
00:35:56,031 --> 00:35:58,116
We are activating the laser-shield
immediately.

554
00:35:59,785 --> 00:36:01,620
And that's the last we heard.

555
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:06,750
All those people, they
were counting on me...

556
00:36:07,918 --> 00:36:09,670
and now they're trapped.

557
00:36:09,878 --> 00:36:13,757
We've tried to reach them,
but there's no communication in or out.

558
00:36:13,924 --> 00:36:14,925
Sox?

559
00:36:15,092 --> 00:36:16,844
Meow, meow, meow. She's correct.

560
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,471
Did you just check me against your cat?

561
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,473
Well, he's not your standard issue feline.

562
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,642
Actually, Sox was
a gift from your grandmother.

563
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:25,894
- Hello, Izzy.
- Hello, Sox.

564
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,690
Hey, what's that noise?
Come on, don't break my cat.

565
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:31,650
He's purring. He likes it.

566
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:32,776
Sox, do you like that?

567
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:33,902
I do.

568
00:36:34,987 --> 00:36:38,031
Well, I hope you're ready for action.
Because all we needed was a pilot.

569
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,199
For what?

570
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,410
I have a plan, and I have a team.

571
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:45,664
Come on!

572
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:13,692
All right, team. Fall in.

573
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:15,694
Whoa.

574
00:37:17,279 --> 00:37:20,616
I found a pilot.
Operation Surprise Party is a go!

575
00:37:23,327 --> 00:37:26,705
I like this. An elite squad.
Best of the best.

576
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,584
You know, her grandmother was the greatest
space ranger in the history of the corps.

577
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,187
It'll be an honor to work with you.

578
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:33,837
Come on, gather 'round, team.

579
00:37:36,757 --> 00:37:37,925
Let's review our objectives.

580
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,134
Kill the robots.

581
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,344
And don't die.

582
00:37:40,802 --> 00:37:43,639
"Don't die" is just something
you wanna do every day.

583
00:37:43,764 --> 00:37:44,765
It's still an objective.

584
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,808
If I may, we have one objective.

585
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,853
We need to put this crystal in the turnip
and get outta here.

586
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,648
So, to do that, we have
to get onto the base.

587
00:37:52,814 --> 00:37:55,108
To do that, we have to kill all the robots.

588
00:37:55,275 --> 00:37:57,611
To do that,
we have to destroy the Zurg ship.

589
00:37:57,819 --> 00:38:00,572
And to do any of that, we have to not die.

590
00:38:02,157 --> 00:38:03,242
DERIC.

591
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,661
Allow me to explain
Operation Surprise Party.

592
00:38:05,786 --> 00:38:08,622
It's a variation on
Operation Thunder Spear.

593
00:38:08,747 --> 00:38:10,099
Didn't you get a medal for that one?

594
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,834
Two, actually, but...

595
00:38:12,084 --> 00:38:14,127
Wait, how do you know
about Operation Thunder Spear?

596
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:16,936
I've read all my grandma's space
ranger books from cover to cover.

597
00:38:17,089 --> 00:38:18,131
Twice.

598
00:38:19,842 --> 00:38:21,426
Excuse me, robot kitty-cat.

599
00:38:21,593 --> 00:38:22,594
Oh, sorry.

600
00:38:23,512 --> 00:38:27,182
Sensors have indicated that the Zurg ship
powers the robots on the ground.

601
00:38:27,391 --> 00:38:31,478
So, we fly up there, we blow up the ship.
And surprise, robots!

602
00:38:31,645 --> 00:38:32,729
You're toast.

603
00:38:32,855 --> 00:38:34,898
Then, we put your crystal in the turnip...

604
00:38:35,065 --> 00:38:36,567
And finish the mission.

605
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:39,862
It's a good plan. To infinity.

606
00:38:41,405 --> 00:38:42,841
Are you trying to get
me to pull your finger?

607
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:43,866
Don't fall for it.

608
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:45,492
No, not like that, it was...

609
00:38:46,243 --> 00:38:48,370
Sorry, it's a thing your grandma and I
used to do.

610
00:38:48,537 --> 00:38:49,538
Ew.

611
00:38:50,122 --> 00:38:51,882
I... We would never...
She didn't mean to...

612
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,166
Anyway, forget it. Moving on.

613
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:57,754
Let's load these munitions into the
Armadillo and steel ourselves for combat.

614
00:38:57,838 --> 00:39:00,632
Operation Surprise Party is on!

615
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:03,177
Buzz, do you hear that?

616
00:39:03,677 --> 00:39:04,678
I hear something.

617
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:08,599
You think it's a robot?

618
00:39:08,807 --> 00:39:11,101
Nah, we've never seen a robot
this far from the base.

619
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,269
I don't hear anything.

620
00:39:13,145 --> 00:39:14,146
Oh. Now I do!

621
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,156
Don't worry, we got you!

622
00:39:28,118 --> 00:39:29,118
What?

623
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,540
Fear not! The junior patrol has your back.

624
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:34,749
The junior what?

625
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:40,047
No! The ship!

626
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:47,762
Did I get it?

627
00:39:47,804 --> 00:39:48,597
Pretty close.

628
00:39:48,764 --> 00:39:50,241
Sorry, I'm not trained with this weapon.

629
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,058
Let me reload it.

630
00:39:51,225 --> 00:39:53,435
Not trained? Wait,
what do you mean, you're not trained?

631
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:07,199
You there! Grab it! Grab it!

632
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,701
Grab what? Oh.

633
00:40:09,868 --> 00:40:11,578
I'm not allowed to handle weapons.

634
00:40:11,745 --> 00:40:13,580
Be a violation of my parole.

635
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,207
- Parole?
- Buzz!

636
00:40:15,415 --> 00:40:16,415
Izzy! Now!

637
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:21,547
No!

638
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:22,965
Okay, new plan.

639
00:40:23,173 --> 00:40:24,967
New plan? What was the old plan?

640
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,772
I need the...
Has anyone seen the harpoons?

641
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,328
They came preloaded with a harpoon,
but I can't find...

642
00:40:35,352 --> 00:40:36,520
Oh, no, here, I found them.

643
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:39,647
Don't worry, I found the harpoons,
I'm gonna reload it now. Check this out.

644
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:50,033
Did I get it?

645
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,200
A little to the left.

646
00:41:16,977 --> 00:41:17,977
What?

647
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:22,399
Did I get it?

648
00:41:22,608 --> 00:41:23,692
You got it!

649
00:41:23,817 --> 00:41:24,860
Yes!

650
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:28,822
Boom!

651
00:41:57,142 --> 00:42:00,562
Okay, okay... What
exactly... How did that...

652
00:42:00,771 --> 00:42:01,771
Who are you?

653
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:04,066
We're the junior patrol at your service.

654
00:42:04,233 --> 00:42:06,610
Right. I'm gonna need more information.

655
00:42:06,777 --> 00:42:09,655
We're a volunteer team
of self-motivated cadets.

656
00:42:09,821 --> 00:42:12,741
We train one weekend a month
here at the outpost.

657
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,011
Mo and Darby and I were
the first to arrive last weekend...

658
00:42:15,035 --> 00:42:16,286
when the robots showed up.

659
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,248
So, we cooked up Operation Surprise Party.

660
00:42:19,414 --> 00:42:20,916
So you're rookies?

661
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:24,419
Oh, boy. We'd love to be rookies.
Still building up to that.

662
00:42:24,837 --> 00:42:26,964
Okay. Do you have munitions training?

663
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:28,369
- Partial.
- Tactical engagement?

664
00:42:28,465 --> 00:42:29,716
- Pending.
- Combat experience?

665
00:42:29,883 --> 00:42:33,095
Yes! If you count the robot situation
we just went through.

666
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,888
Okay. Come on, Sox.

667
00:42:35,055 --> 00:42:36,098
What are you doing?

668
00:42:36,306 --> 00:42:40,435
Look, you seem like nice people. I'm very
supportive of your training initiatives.

669
00:42:40,644 --> 00:42:42,604
But I'm gonna go ahead
and take it from here.

670
00:42:42,771 --> 00:42:44,439
We just saved you from that robot.

671
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,650
- Excuse me?
- Mo made the kill shot.

672
00:42:46,942 --> 00:42:48,110
Mo got lucky.

673
00:42:48,193 --> 00:42:49,236
Very.

674
00:42:49,987 --> 00:42:52,698
So, if you could just point me
in the direction of another ship...

675
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:56,243
There are operational spacecraft
at the abandoned storage depot.

676
00:42:56,410 --> 00:42:57,619
Great. Where's that?

677
00:42:57,786 --> 00:43:01,164
The storage depot is directly adjacent
to the Resource Reconstituting Center...

678
00:43:01,373 --> 00:43:04,793
which is 4.2 kilometers
from your current location.

679
00:43:04,918 --> 00:43:06,211
Great. Where's that?

680
00:43:06,378 --> 00:43:07,838
It's actually quite simple.

681
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,256
Okay...

682
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:12,926
You will first head south,
towards the base.

683
00:43:13,093 --> 00:43:15,053
After two stoplights, you will...

684
00:43:15,637 --> 00:43:18,473
Wait. That is not right.
That is a dead end.

685
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:21,059
Oh, I see.
I was in the wrong spot.

686
00:43:21,185 --> 00:43:23,395
Apologies. I will start over.

687
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:27,232
You will first head south, towards
the base. After two stoplights...

688
00:43:27,441 --> 00:43:29,484
you'll take a gentle left, and...

689
00:43:30,152 --> 00:43:32,321
Shoot. I have made another error.

690
00:43:32,529 --> 00:43:33,529
We'll just show you.

691
00:43:33,739 --> 00:43:37,117
Allow me to restart. You will
first head south, towards the base.

692
00:43:37,201 --> 00:43:41,121
After two stoplights,
you'll take a hard right.

693
00:43:41,371 --> 00:43:43,165
Buzz Light year supplemental mission log.

694
00:43:43,332 --> 00:43:47,461
Having finally achieved hyper speed, I
now have an additional obstacle in my way.

695
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:52,591
In order to flee this planet, I'll have
to destroy a massive alien ship alone...

696
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:54,343
with no assistance of any kind.

697
00:43:54,551 --> 00:43:57,012
You know, we could help you.
It is our plan.

698
00:43:57,137 --> 00:43:58,138
I can't allow that.

699
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,098
Star Command code 2709.3...

700
00:44:00,182 --> 00:44:03,310
forbids me from placing
unqualified personnel in harm's way.

701
00:44:03,477 --> 00:44:05,312
Okay. But I'm a Hawthorne.

702
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:06,757
It's more than just a name, Izzy.

703
00:44:06,855 --> 00:44:07,874
You have to know exactly...

704
00:44:07,898 --> 00:44:09,709
- how to react in every situation.
- ...know what you're gonna say next.

705
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:10,943
Thought I had that one.

706
00:44:11,151 --> 00:44:12,152
Okay.

707
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:15,155
And you, you're in a correctional situation
of some kind?

708
00:44:15,322 --> 00:44:16,323
Parole program.

709
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,451
I do this, and they shave
a little time off my sentence.

710
00:44:19,618 --> 00:44:21,370
But I really learned a lot in there.

711
00:44:21,578 --> 00:44:23,658
Darby can take any three things
and make 'em explode.

712
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:25,999
Okay.
And what about you?

713
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:29,753
Me? Oh, well, I thought this was gonna be
like a fun boot camp-workout thing...

714
00:44:29,962 --> 00:44:31,255
but it is not...

715
00:44:31,421 --> 00:44:33,841
so I was actually coming out here
to turn in my stuff...

716
00:44:34,049 --> 00:44:35,133
He's a quitter.

717
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,385
I'm not a quitter.

718
00:44:36,552 --> 00:44:37,552
You were quitting.

719
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,948
What are you talking about? I was
just going in a different direction...

720
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,515
Yeah, the direction of a quitter.

721
00:44:41,723 --> 00:44:42,891
You know what? I give up.

722
00:44:43,016 --> 00:44:45,018
- See?
- On your right.

723
00:44:59,283 --> 00:45:00,617
Now where was I?

724
00:45:00,951 --> 00:45:02,411
Here we are.
Let me back up.

725
00:45:04,204 --> 00:45:07,082
Hey, keep workin' on your skills.
It's the only way to get better.

726
00:45:07,207 --> 00:45:08,208
We can help you.

727
00:45:08,375 --> 00:45:10,961
And I appreciate that.
Just go back to your training facility.

728
00:45:11,086 --> 00:45:12,921
Stay alert, stay safe.

729
00:45:13,088 --> 00:45:16,508
I'm gonna commandeer this P-32 Armadillo
and go blow up the Zurg ship.

730
00:45:16,717 --> 00:45:18,302
So, this is just goodbye?

731
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:20,012
Affirmative. Goodbye.

732
00:45:22,347 --> 00:45:24,266
Sorry, I forgot my cat.

733
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,153
Life forms detected.

734
00:45:36,361 --> 00:45:37,361
What are they?

735
00:45:37,487 --> 00:45:39,198
Giant insectoid organisms.

736
00:45:39,823 --> 00:45:41,867
This building appears to be
some sort of hive.

737
00:45:42,034 --> 00:45:43,034
Are they a threat?

738
00:45:43,118 --> 00:45:44,745
Sensors indicate they are hibernating.

739
00:45:44,953 --> 00:45:45,953
Very good.

740
00:45:46,496 --> 00:45:47,748
Oh, look.

741
00:45:47,915 --> 00:45:49,458
It's the XL-01.

742
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,293
It's been a long time since...

743
00:45:51,793 --> 00:45:52,711
Whoa!

744
00:45:52,794 --> 00:45:53,795
What is it?

745
00:45:53,962 --> 00:45:55,380
Come on. I'll show you.

746
00:46:10,521 --> 00:46:11,855
Finally.

747
00:46:15,651 --> 00:46:16,652
Sorry to interrupt.

748
00:46:16,818 --> 00:46:18,505
Looks like you were having
a real nice moment.

749
00:46:18,529 --> 00:46:20,049
What are you doing here?
It's not safe.

750
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,365
You took the keys to our truck.

751
00:46:21,573 --> 00:46:22,574
Oh, there they are.

752
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:29,206
Come on, come on.

753
00:46:29,289 --> 00:46:30,374
- Quiet.
- I'm trying!

754
00:46:32,251 --> 00:46:33,460
Got it.

755
00:46:37,005 --> 00:46:38,445
- Somebody get the...
- Get the door!

756
00:46:40,384 --> 00:46:42,504
You were gonna say "Get the door,"
and I got the door.

757
00:46:44,054 --> 00:46:46,515
Well, I'm gonna be blunt here.
I wish that hadn't happened.

758
00:46:46,682 --> 00:46:48,016
So do the rest of us.

759
00:46:48,141 --> 00:46:49,142
Everyone grab a weapon.

760
00:46:49,309 --> 00:46:51,311
Boy, I'd love to, but my parole...

761
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,897
As a Star Command officer,
I grant you emergency authority.

762
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:55,625
We're going to blast our way outta here.

763
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:56,649
Now we're talkin'!

764
00:46:56,733 --> 00:47:00,404
Buzz, the probability of surviving
a frontal attack is 38.2%.

765
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:01,697
Seems a bit low.

766
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,031
What about stealth mode?

767
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,509
How do you know about stealth mode?

768
00:47:04,533 --> 00:47:06,613
Grandma and I used to play stealth mode
all the time.

769
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,422
It was like hide-and-seek.
But with a twist.

770
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:11,999
Okay, well, it's actually good thinking.
I'll use stealth mode to disorient them.

771
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,084
Or, and stick with me here...

772
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:17,296
we could all use stealth mode
and just walk right out.

773
00:47:19,047 --> 00:47:20,924
You mean you would wear space ranger suits?

774
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:22,885
This one already has my name on it.

775
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,680
Okay.

776
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,515
Let's review.

777
00:47:28,682 --> 00:47:29,682
I'm going...

778
00:47:29,725 --> 00:47:30,726
That way.

779
00:47:30,893 --> 00:47:31,893
And you're going...

780
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,020
That way.

781
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,188
Okay. Very good.

782
00:47:34,354 --> 00:47:37,024
Check it out. I'm Feathers... Feathering...

783
00:47:38,108 --> 00:47:39,818
Oh, look. A pen. Cool.

784
00:47:40,027 --> 00:47:42,070
- Does yours have a pen?
- Okay. Pay attention.

785
00:47:42,237 --> 00:47:43,437
Stealth mode is fairly simple.

786
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:45,617
There are just two parts.
You press the button...

787
00:47:45,782 --> 00:47:48,035
- Is it this button?
- I will tell you which button.

788
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:49,429
- What about this button?
- I'm sorry.

789
00:47:49,453 --> 00:47:51,389
We're not gonna have time
to go over all the buttons.

790
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:52,974
Okay, forget the button.
What about this thing?

791
00:47:52,998 --> 00:47:53,790
- It's more of a pull...
- No! No, no!

792
00:47:53,999 --> 00:47:56,126
That's the Surrender String.
You never pull that.

793
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,629
There is no more shameful maneuver
for a space ranger.

794
00:47:58,795 --> 00:47:59,796
Excuse me.

795
00:47:59,963 --> 00:48:02,174
Did I miss which button
is the stealth mode button?

796
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,383
It's this button.

797
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,593
Not yet.

798
00:48:04,801 --> 00:48:07,513
You push this button,
then you go out the front door...

799
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,473
and I'll go blow up the Zurg ship.

800
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,141
- Ready?
- Ready.

801
00:48:11,350 --> 00:48:13,143
No, wait. Not ready. Hang on.

802
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:15,229
Okay. Got 'em.
That would've been embarrassing.

803
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:17,689
Okay.

804
00:48:17,898 --> 00:48:18,982
Goodbye again.

805
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,282
Sox, you're inhibiting my visual.

806
00:48:27,407 --> 00:48:28,784
Oh, sorry. Is this better?

807
00:48:28,992 --> 00:48:30,786
- Negative.
- Okay. How about this?

808
00:48:31,495 --> 00:48:32,704
How about this?

809
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:46,552
Okay. Here we go.

810
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,228
Very good.
Stealth mode working as planned.

811
00:48:57,479 --> 00:49:00,774
This is pretty cool.
These dumb bugs can't even see us.

812
00:49:01,358 --> 00:49:03,193
Hey, bug. Hey, bug, bug!

813
00:49:03,402 --> 00:49:04,922
I'm right here, bug. Can't you see me?

814
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:08,949
He can't. He can't see me at all.

815
00:49:09,241 --> 00:49:11,410
And time has elapsed.

816
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,662
Wait, the timer.

817
00:49:13,871 --> 00:49:15,247
They don't know about the timer.

818
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:18,584
You can't see me.

819
00:49:18,792 --> 00:49:20,085
Wait. I can see you.

820
00:49:20,794 --> 00:49:22,004
I can see you too.

821
00:49:22,546 --> 00:49:23,922
The bugs can see us.

822
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,133
No, no, no, no. I surrender!

823
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:35,517
Back! Get back!

824
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:39,021
This isn't working.

825
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:40,522
You have to keep going.

826
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,567
We have to turn around.

827
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:46,731
They're headed right for us.

828
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:49,114
No, no, do not approach the vehicle.

829
00:50:03,212 --> 00:50:04,213
All right!

830
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:05,899
- Way to adapt, team.
- Get it up here.

831
00:50:06,048 --> 00:50:07,925
Why are you congratulating yourselves?

832
00:50:08,133 --> 00:50:10,111
Because I just Hawthorned us
right outta that situation.

833
00:50:10,135 --> 00:50:13,305
- But you could've made it if...
- If you had told us stealth mode wears off.

834
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:14,430
Well...

835
00:50:16,141 --> 00:50:18,310
Okay, everyone just strap in.

836
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:22,773
Hello, I am your...

837
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:36,410
Hold on.

838
00:50:40,874 --> 00:50:41,917
Are we going to space?

839
00:50:42,167 --> 00:50:43,607
No, I'm going to drop you somewhere.

840
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:49,424
That was a big swirly-do.
I think I need a bag.

841
00:50:49,591 --> 00:50:51,191
No, no, do not vomit inside the vehicle.

842
00:50:51,301 --> 00:50:53,470
I can see stars. That is space.

843
00:50:53,637 --> 00:50:54,757
What is happening right now?

844
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:55,931
She's afraid of space.

845
00:50:56,139 --> 00:50:57,534
- What?
- She should be. It's horrible.

846
00:50:57,558 --> 00:50:59,518
Izzy, remember your exercises.

847
00:50:59,643 --> 00:51:00,936
- It's coming.
- No, no, no.

848
00:51:01,144 --> 00:51:02,247
Engage your helmet.
That'll catch it.

849
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,111
- Buzz? We got a ship!
- Izzy, I'm trying to...

850
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:27,629
I can't see anything.

851
00:51:27,796 --> 00:51:29,590
Oh, no! The dark side of the planet.

852
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:30,924
Over there! 10 o'clock!

853
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:33,427
Hold on. This isn't gonna be pretty.

854
00:51:44,146 --> 00:51:45,189
Is everyone okay?

855
00:51:45,314 --> 00:51:46,314
I think so.

856
00:51:56,491 --> 00:51:57,659
Sox, get me a damage report.

857
00:51:57,743 --> 00:51:59,494
One moment, please.

858
00:52:01,205 --> 00:52:02,998
Okay. This is better.

859
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,666
This is better?

860
00:52:04,791 --> 00:52:08,504
No, obviously this is worse overall.
I just meant, you know...

861
00:52:09,338 --> 00:52:10,756
How are you afraid of space?

862
00:52:11,256 --> 00:52:12,341
It's pretty easy.

863
00:52:12,633 --> 00:52:16,220
Did you know if you let go out there,
you just keep goin' in the same direction?

864
00:52:16,386 --> 00:52:18,388
Forever. Just...

865
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:21,183
Well, then how were you gonna blow up
the Zurg ship?

866
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,060
Oh, I would a been ground support.

867
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,188
I know, Grandma wasn't afraid of space.

868
00:52:26,396 --> 00:52:28,273
No, because she was a space ranger.

869
00:52:28,482 --> 00:52:30,943
Astrophobia is an
automatic disqualification.

870
00:52:31,068 --> 00:52:32,402
What was that thing?

871
00:52:32,653 --> 00:52:34,255
- I don't know.
- Well, is it gonna come back?

872
00:52:34,279 --> 00:52:35,405
I don't know.

873
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:37,908
But how did it...
Okay, you don't know.

874
00:52:42,037 --> 00:52:45,415
I was done. I finally had the crystal.
This was supposed to be over.

875
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:47,626
But who am I kidding?

876
00:52:48,585 --> 00:52:51,630
I don't need a crystal. I need a
time machine to get outta this mess.

877
00:52:52,756 --> 00:52:54,007
Assessment complete.

878
00:52:54,174 --> 00:52:55,175
How bad is it?

879
00:52:57,261 --> 00:53:01,306
The blast was absorbed by the heat shield
and only caused a minor electrical short.

880
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,474
Okay.

881
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:04,241
So, in order to be flight operational...

882
00:53:04,309 --> 00:53:07,646
the Armadillo will require
a material of specialized capacitance.

883
00:53:07,813 --> 00:53:09,064
Oh, like an electrical thingy.

884
00:53:09,314 --> 00:53:10,315
How do you know that?

885
00:53:10,482 --> 00:53:11,525
We learned this.

886
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:15,904
Specialized capacitance? Remember,
we built those field radios last month?

887
00:53:16,029 --> 00:53:17,072
Oh, yeah. That was fun.

888
00:53:17,281 --> 00:53:18,591
Yeah, except Darby messed hers up.

889
00:53:18,615 --> 00:53:19,616
I'm gonna mess you up.

890
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,577
Please. I'm trying to think here.

891
00:53:22,035 --> 00:53:23,871
I messed mine up, but then I fixed it.

892
00:53:24,037 --> 00:53:25,515
Yeah, but you broke that computer console.

893
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:27,624
I needed that little coil for its...
What was it?

894
00:53:27,749 --> 00:53:28,792
Specialized capacitance...

895
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:31,336
Hey, honestly,
there is a lot of room out here.

896
00:53:31,503 --> 00:53:34,256
If you guys wanna reminisce,
you could go over there.

897
00:53:34,423 --> 00:53:36,592
Or, look, there's no one trying
to think over there.

898
00:53:37,634 --> 00:53:38,677
We can go up there.

899
00:53:38,802 --> 00:53:39,803
Fine. Perfect.

900
00:53:39,928 --> 00:53:42,222
Yes.
Okay, new plan.

901
00:53:42,389 --> 00:53:43,390
Wait, what?

902
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:45,642
That mining facility
will have a console, right?

903
00:53:45,767 --> 00:53:48,145
That console will have
a little coil thing, right?

904
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,032
And that little coil thing will have the...

905
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:51,148
Specialized capacitance.

906
00:53:51,356 --> 00:53:53,650
That we need to fix the ship. Right?

907
00:53:53,775 --> 00:53:54,775
She's right.

908
00:53:57,905 --> 00:54:01,074
Good job.
Now that's thinking like a Hawthorne.

909
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:06,705
Let's go get that part and get outta here
before that thing finds us again.

910
00:54:29,019 --> 00:54:30,312
Whoa.

911
00:54:31,271 --> 00:54:32,439
Over there.

912
00:54:35,776 --> 00:54:37,277
Okay, here we go.

913
00:54:45,702 --> 00:54:47,204
Buzz Light year mission log.

914
00:54:47,412 --> 00:54:49,957
In order to repair our ship,
we have to find some way...

915
00:54:50,123 --> 00:54:52,000
to get inside the command center and...

916
00:54:54,169 --> 00:54:56,213
Nice job, elderly convict.

917
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:01,385
Okay. The activation
coil should be in here.

918
00:55:01,552 --> 00:55:02,553
Sox?

919
00:55:03,554 --> 00:55:04,555
Need a pen?

920
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,640
And, got it.

921
00:55:07,516 --> 00:55:08,809
Okay, yeah. Another time.

922
00:55:10,519 --> 00:55:11,520
Oh, no.

923
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:13,647
Security measures activated.

924
00:55:14,731 --> 00:55:16,692
No! Not this again.

925
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:17,985
Not what? What is this?

926
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:23,073
A capture cone. It holds ya
until they come and get ya.

927
00:55:23,198 --> 00:55:25,510
No one's coming to get us.
They're all trapped on the base.

928
00:55:25,534 --> 00:55:26,774
So we should just leave, right?

929
00:55:26,869 --> 00:55:28,287
We can't just leave.

930
00:55:28,453 --> 00:55:31,456
Sure we can. Take it from me,
you can always just leave.

931
00:55:32,082 --> 00:55:33,083
Look. See?

932
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:35,627
Come on!

933
00:55:36,879 --> 00:55:37,880
Told you.

934
00:55:38,463 --> 00:55:41,216
Now be careful because these things...

935
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:43,969
combine if they touch.

936
00:55:44,136 --> 00:55:46,763
All right, sorry.
But maybe if we both try it?

937
00:55:46,889 --> 00:55:48,599
That's not gonna work.

938
00:55:48,807 --> 00:55:50,017
You haven't even tried.

939
00:55:51,393 --> 00:55:52,394
No, no, no!

940
00:55:52,603 --> 00:55:53,604
Ow, meow!

941
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:56,148
Yeah, that didn't work.

942
00:55:56,315 --> 00:55:57,649
- Buzz?
- Whoa, whoa, hold on.

943
00:55:57,816 --> 00:55:59,902
I'm no help to anyone
if I'm stuck in there with you.

944
00:56:00,068 --> 00:56:01,612
Sox, can you turn these off?

945
00:56:02,863 --> 00:56:04,656
I can't reach the controls.

946
00:56:05,282 --> 00:56:07,534
Wait, there's a soft spot in
the floor here. Maybe we...

947
00:56:07,701 --> 00:56:08,994
That's my foot.

948
00:56:09,661 --> 00:56:10,871
- Sorry.
- Hey. Whoa. Watch it!

949
00:56:11,872 --> 00:56:14,750
Wait, that's it.
That thing powers these things.

950
00:56:14,917 --> 00:56:16,960
- Then let's hit it again.
- Wait, wait, wait.

951
00:56:17,628 --> 00:56:19,129
We need the door to be open.

952
00:56:19,296 --> 00:56:22,299
So I'll open this,
you slam into the power source...

953
00:56:22,508 --> 00:56:24,885
these things will disappear,
and we'll walk right out.

954
00:56:25,010 --> 00:56:25,886
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

955
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:27,011
Ready?

956
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:32,058
Keep trying!

957
00:56:36,313 --> 00:56:37,856
We're just not heavy enough.

958
00:56:38,524 --> 00:56:40,275
Buzz, we need you.

959
00:56:40,442 --> 00:56:41,735
Wait, in there?

960
00:56:41,944 --> 00:56:44,154
But if it doesn't work,
I won't be able to save you.

961
00:56:44,321 --> 00:56:47,199
You don't need to save us.
You need to join us.

962
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:56,458
Again.

963
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:58,961
Again!

964
00:57:01,505 --> 00:57:02,505
Again!

965
00:57:09,388 --> 00:57:10,514
No!

966
00:57:11,265 --> 00:57:12,307
Go, go!

967
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:14,768
Watch out!

968
00:57:19,022 --> 00:57:20,023
Buzz, no!

969
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:21,358
We need the coil.

970
00:57:39,418 --> 00:57:40,794
We got you.

971
00:57:49,887 --> 00:57:51,013
Oh, look. Snacks.

972
00:57:53,182 --> 00:57:54,474
Anyone go for a snack?

973
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:06,653
Here. Let's all recharge a little.

974
00:58:09,865 --> 00:58:10,991
Here you go.

975
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:17,164
This is... What... What's...

976
00:58:17,873 --> 00:58:19,041
What's happenin' here?

977
00:58:19,374 --> 00:58:20,768
Somethin' wrong with your sandwich?

978
00:58:20,792 --> 00:58:23,378
Why's the meat on the outside?

979
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,339
'Cause it's a sandwich?

980
00:58:25,547 --> 00:58:27,549
No, the bread is supposed to be
on the outside.

981
00:58:27,674 --> 00:58:29,176
What, like bread, meat, bread?

982
00:58:29,384 --> 00:58:30,594
That's too much bread.

983
00:58:31,011 --> 00:58:32,846
Yeah, but this is all wet.

984
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:35,015
Yeah. Juicy fingers.
That's the best part.

985
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:36,892
When's the last time you had a sandwich?

986
00:58:37,059 --> 00:58:39,061
I don't know, hundred years ago?
Give or take.

987
00:58:39,186 --> 00:58:41,188
This guy. "Bread, meat, bread."

988
00:58:41,313 --> 00:58:42,314
It's too much bread.

989
00:58:42,523 --> 00:58:44,723
That would just suck all the moisture
out of your mouth.

990
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,568
Good one, Darby.

991
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:47,945
Oh, no!

992
00:58:48,153 --> 00:58:49,153
Sox!

993
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,448
Wake up, Sox.

994
00:58:51,990 --> 00:58:53,617
Come on, little buddy.
Come back to me.

995
00:58:54,159 --> 00:58:55,702
Please, Sox, I'm sorry.

996
00:58:56,495 --> 00:58:57,496
Sox.

997
00:58:59,957 --> 00:59:01,667
Hello. I require a reboot.

998
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:10,676
I'm sorry, guys. I almost killed Sox.

999
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,095
I almost got us all killed back there.

1000
00:59:13,262 --> 00:59:16,515
Hey. Listen to me.
It was just a mistake.

1001
00:59:17,099 --> 00:59:18,100
Right, Buzz?

1002
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:24,106
Just, you know, try to be a little better.

1003
00:59:30,612 --> 00:59:31,655
Listen.

1004
00:59:34,449 --> 00:59:36,118
I just...

1005
00:59:37,077 --> 00:59:42,666
When I first went to the academy,
I was not, you know, good.

1006
00:59:43,667 --> 00:59:46,128
I screwed up. Every day.

1007
00:59:47,796 --> 00:59:49,232
I got tangled in the obstacle course...

1008
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:51,967
my hands shook so much
I couldn't hit the target.

1009
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:54,803
Not the bull's-eye, the whole target.

1010
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,806
And I was gonna quit after the first week.

1011
00:59:58,015 --> 01:00:00,893
It was clear I was not
space ranger material.

1012
01:00:01,101 --> 01:00:02,144
Really?

1013
01:00:02,519 --> 01:00:03,562
Yeah.

1014
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:06,106
But her grandma saw something in me.

1015
01:00:08,692 --> 01:00:10,152
So, I started looking for it too.

1016
01:00:12,321 --> 01:00:13,322
Recalibrating.

1017
01:00:14,823 --> 01:00:17,159
One corrupted file restored.

1018
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:20,162
Hey, he's lighting up.

1019
01:00:21,038 --> 01:00:23,165
- Grandma...
- Hello, Sox.

1020
01:00:23,332 --> 01:00:25,083
I need you to do me a favor.

1021
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,213
I need you to look after my best friend.
His name's Buzz.

1022
01:00:29,796 --> 01:00:33,342
He's away right now,
but he'll be back soon.

1023
01:00:33,509 --> 01:00:35,511
He's a space ranger.

1024
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:38,555
He's going to get us all home.
Get us all home...

1025
01:00:53,153 --> 01:00:54,363
What's wrong?

1026
01:00:54,905 --> 01:00:56,156
Did you not hear that?

1027
01:00:56,573 --> 01:00:58,951
She believed I could
fix the mistake I made.

1028
01:00:59,826 --> 01:01:01,995
And that belief cost her everything.

1029
01:01:02,871 --> 01:01:04,748
Everything? No.

1030
01:01:05,457 --> 01:01:08,877
She had Grandma Kiko,
my dad and me, all her friends.

1031
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:13,882
She didn't mean to be here, but she had
a whole life on this planet, Buzz.

1032
01:01:14,716 --> 01:01:15,884
All of us have.

1033
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,762
Except for you.

1034
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:25,352
We wanted to be space rangers again.
We wanted to matter.

1035
01:01:26,603 --> 01:01:29,398
Believe me. She mattered.

1036
01:01:42,244 --> 01:01:43,829
You know, it is pretty good this way.

1037
01:01:44,413 --> 01:01:48,333
Yeah? Bread, meat, bread.
How long did you do it like that?

1038
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:49,960
Forever.

1039
01:01:52,171 --> 01:01:53,505
Fully recharged.

1040
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:55,007
Come on.

1041
01:01:55,174 --> 01:01:57,718
Let's go put this part in the ship
and get out of here.

1042
01:01:58,302 --> 01:01:59,382
Sox, can you light our way?

1043
01:01:59,428 --> 01:02:00,429
Of course.

1044
01:02:03,932 --> 01:02:06,643
I see you. I'm gonna get you.
I'm gonna get you.

1045
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:07,603
Ah, I didn't get you.

1046
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:09,438
- Sox?
- Where'd you go? I got you!

1047
01:02:09,605 --> 01:02:10,856
- Sox.
- Yeah, sorry.

1048
01:02:14,067 --> 01:02:17,654
This is exciting.
Operation Surprise Party, here we come!

1049
01:02:17,863 --> 01:02:20,574
Wait, what? Negative.
I can't put you in harm's way like that.

1050
01:02:20,824 --> 01:02:22,594
What, are you gonna
do the whole mission alone?

1051
01:02:22,618 --> 01:02:23,619
I can do it.

1052
01:02:23,869 --> 01:02:25,454
Because you got a Hawthorne right here.

1053
01:02:25,621 --> 01:02:29,249
And I appreciate that. Tell you what,
I'll let you know if I need you.

1054
01:02:29,374 --> 01:02:33,378
But until then, let's just try to get back
to the Armadillo without any more trouble.

1055
01:02:40,802 --> 01:02:41,803
Run!

1056
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:47,808
No!

1057
01:02:52,397 --> 01:02:53,273
What?

1058
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,192
It's after me. Go back to the ship.

1059
01:02:55,317 --> 01:02:56,360
But, Buzz!

1060
01:02:59,446 --> 01:03:00,864
Buzz Light year mission log.

1061
01:03:03,951 --> 01:03:05,285
I'm being pursued by a...

1062
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,580
Just a massive robot.

1063
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:12,793
I'm leading it away
while the others escape to the ship.

1064
01:03:34,898 --> 01:03:36,066
Buzz.

1065
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:38,277
What? How do you know my name?

1066
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:40,612
Come with me.

1067
01:03:40,821 --> 01:03:41,822
What?

1068
01:03:45,576 --> 01:03:48,203
This is definitely a
violation of my parole.

1069
01:03:52,332 --> 01:03:54,334
Come on. Let's get outta here.

1070
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:37,753
Ready yourselves for launch.
Operation Surprise Party is back on.

1071
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:38,921
What? With us?

1072
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:40,847
What, am I gonna do
the whole mission alone?

1073
01:04:41,381 --> 01:04:44,301
We can't launch yet.
I need five minutes to install the coil.

1074
01:04:48,305 --> 01:04:50,015
We can't sit here for five minutes.

1075
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:51,659
The ship still has hover capabilities.

1076
01:04:51,683 --> 01:04:52,683
Then let's use 'em.

1077
01:05:11,161 --> 01:05:12,681
We might lose 'em in the fire geysers.

1078
01:05:12,955 --> 01:05:15,415
Point the way.
You two, blast some robots.

1079
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,352
But we haven't even finished
our munitions training.

1080
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:18,794
How hard can it be? Look.

1081
01:05:19,044 --> 01:05:21,547
We got these spikey things,
and these ones probably explode.

1082
01:05:21,672 --> 01:05:23,090
Just do whatever feels right.

1083
01:05:23,298 --> 01:05:24,675
What? What are you gonna do?

1084
01:05:24,800 --> 01:05:26,760
I'm gonna dance with Mr. Boom.

1085
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:35,310
Now that's satisfying.

1086
01:05:35,561 --> 01:05:36,603
20% complete.

1087
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:37,813
Out of 100?

1088
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:44,570
They're gaining on us.
Where are those fire geysers?

1089
01:05:44,736 --> 01:05:45,737
Dead ahead.

1090
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:47,465
Don't worry, I know every last inch of...

1091
01:05:47,489 --> 01:05:48,490
Watch out!

1092
01:05:59,501 --> 01:06:00,878
Here. Throw this.

1093
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:02,754
- Wait, wait. Hold on.
- Throw it!

1094
01:06:12,556 --> 01:06:14,183
Fire geysers dead ahead!

1095
01:06:18,020 --> 01:06:19,438
50% complete.

1096
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,319
Hey! We have explosives back here.

1097
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:32,534
Quick! Give me something.

1098
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:49,801
90% complete.

1099
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:51,968
Izzy, do you know how to
transfer power on the fly?

1100
01:06:52,054 --> 01:06:53,472
I've done it in the simulator.

1101
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:55,057
Well, it's about to get real.

1102
01:06:55,682 --> 01:06:58,185
- Do you need my help with anything?
- Absolutely not.

1103
01:06:58,352 --> 01:06:59,394
95% complete.

1104
01:06:59,561 --> 01:07:01,438
Ready thrusters. Green button. Middle.

1105
01:07:01,855 --> 01:07:02,855
Done.

1106
01:07:04,608 --> 01:07:05,651
Remember from training.

1107
01:07:05,817 --> 01:07:07,986
You don't pull the trigger,
you squeeze the trigger.

1108
01:07:08,153 --> 01:07:09,153
I know.

1109
01:07:09,404 --> 01:07:10,614
99% complete.

1110
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:11,925
- Transfer to oscillating power.
- Oscillating power.

1111
01:07:11,949 --> 01:07:12,949
Done.

1112
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:16,537
100% complete.

1113
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:19,540
Reboot.
Okay, be ready to launch...

1114
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:21,305
- once the fuel cell is...
- Ready launch!

1115
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:22,416
No!

1116
01:07:29,716 --> 01:07:30,926
Oh, no.

1117
01:07:31,134 --> 01:07:32,134
Blast!

1118
01:07:37,307 --> 01:07:38,600
Grab the crystal!

1119
01:07:56,994 --> 01:07:57,994
No.

1120
01:08:07,296 --> 01:08:08,297
I...

1121
01:08:18,932 --> 01:08:19,975
Buzz.

1122
01:08:20,642 --> 01:08:21,643
I'm so sorry.

1123
01:08:22,728 --> 01:08:25,314
Everything was happenin' so fast, and I...

1124
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:26,607
I just...

1125
01:08:29,943 --> 01:08:31,695
I made a mistake.

1126
01:08:33,030 --> 01:08:34,198
Yeah.

1127
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:39,453
Okay, but we're not done, right?

1128
01:08:39,953 --> 01:08:41,663
We can still do something.

1129
01:08:41,788 --> 01:08:43,999
Izzy, look around.

1130
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:46,210
There is nothing to do.

1131
01:08:46,376 --> 01:08:47,461
The mission...

1132
01:08:48,754 --> 01:08:49,922
It's over.

1133
01:08:50,631 --> 01:08:51,798
Buzz.

1134
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:53,425
Buzz!

1135
01:08:53,592 --> 01:08:55,052
Where are you going?

1136
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:58,430
I just need to be by myself.

1137
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:02,351
No!

1138
01:09:08,607 --> 01:09:09,608
Buzz!

1139
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:13,611
Buzz.

1140
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:47,646
What the...

1141
01:09:47,938 --> 01:09:50,482
What is this? Where are we?

1142
01:09:51,525 --> 01:09:52,651
Who are you?

1143
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:54,736
Now, that's the question.

1144
01:10:05,247 --> 01:10:07,082
You look good, Buzz.

1145
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:09,376
Dad?

1146
01:10:09,585 --> 01:10:10,586
Guess again.

1147
01:10:25,475 --> 01:10:26,476
Sox?

1148
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,313
Hello, Buzz.

1149
01:10:30,189 --> 01:10:31,648
I don't understand.

1150
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:39,156
I messed this all up.

1151
01:10:39,364 --> 01:10:41,325
Hey. It was just a mistake.

1152
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:43,076
Remember what you told me?

1153
01:10:43,952 --> 01:10:45,037
This one's different.

1154
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,246
Why?

1155
01:10:46,455 --> 01:10:47,831
Because it's mine!

1156
01:10:59,676 --> 01:11:02,596
I'm supposed to be as good as my grandma.

1157
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:05,307
I'm supposed to be a Hawthorne.

1158
01:11:08,143 --> 01:11:09,394
But I'm not.

1159
01:11:22,699 --> 01:11:23,784
Buzz?

1160
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,162
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1161
01:11:27,371 --> 01:11:28,664
You're not me. I'm me.

1162
01:11:28,789 --> 01:11:29,790
Well, you're you now.

1163
01:11:29,957 --> 01:11:31,959
But I'm you 50 years from now.

1164
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,377
Well, there can't be two mes.

1165
01:11:33,544 --> 01:11:34,962
Yet here we both are.

1166
01:11:35,712 --> 01:11:37,005
Okay then. If you're me...

1167
01:11:37,172 --> 01:11:38,882
I'm thinking of a number
between one and...

1168
01:11:39,049 --> 01:11:40,676
Twelve hundred and seventy-three.

1169
01:11:40,843 --> 01:11:41,844
Whoa.

1170
01:11:43,804 --> 01:11:45,097
Isn't that cute?

1171
01:11:45,264 --> 01:11:46,974
Robots can't quite say "Buzz"...

1172
01:11:47,182 --> 01:11:49,518
so around here, I'm just Zurg.

1173
01:11:50,477 --> 01:11:51,562
And I guess so are you.

1174
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:52,688
How? I don't understand.

1175
01:11:52,813 --> 01:11:54,815
Don't worry about it.
None of this is gonna matter.

1176
01:11:54,940 --> 01:11:55,816
Buzz.

1177
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:56,941
Yes?

1178
01:11:56,984 --> 01:11:58,610
You have to explain it all to him.

1179
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:00,362
You're right.

1180
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:02,865
I'm sorry. It's just exciting.

1181
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:04,449
You're finally here.

1182
01:12:04,658 --> 01:12:07,077
See, I reached hyper speed too.

1183
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:08,954
Hyper speed.

1184
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:11,206
Just like you did.

1185
01:12:12,082 --> 01:12:14,501
But I wasn't greeted as a hero.

1186
01:12:15,460 --> 01:12:20,424
No, that new commander was gonna arrest me
for stealing the XL-15.

1187
01:12:20,591 --> 01:12:24,136
I'd found a way to get them home,
and they didn't even care.

1188
01:12:24,344 --> 01:12:25,344
So, I escaped.

1189
01:12:30,809 --> 01:12:34,021
I went as far as I
could as fast as I could.

1190
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:37,900
At that speed for that long,
I travelled centuries.

1191
01:12:38,108 --> 01:12:41,862
And I ended up in a future
you wouldn't recognize...

1192
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:44,740
filled with technology you can't imagine.

1193
01:12:45,032 --> 01:12:47,576
And that's when it dawned on me.

1194
01:12:47,743 --> 01:12:50,954
If we can use this crystal
to go forward in time...

1195
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:53,373
why not use it to go back?

1196
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:55,209
But we can't go back in time.

1197
01:12:55,375 --> 01:12:57,169
- We can now.
- What?

1198
01:12:57,377 --> 01:13:00,339
Listen, Buzz. I've broken time.

1199
01:13:00,506 --> 01:13:03,550
What's happening to you
never happened to me.

1200
01:13:03,717 --> 01:13:07,012
This is a new now that's never been lived.

1201
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,723
You see, we can change things, Buzz.

1202
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:13,936
Well, if we can go back in time,
we can stop ourselves...

1203
01:13:14,019 --> 01:13:15,121
from ever landing on that planet.

1204
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:16,425
From ever hitting that mountain.

1205
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:17,999
We can just continue the mission home.

1206
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,663
And none of this will have ever happened.

1207
01:13:20,275 --> 01:13:21,735
It's a good plan.

1208
01:13:22,027 --> 01:13:24,404
And this crystal is the key to it all.

1209
01:13:24,571 --> 01:13:26,031
Wait, don't you already have one?

1210
01:13:26,198 --> 01:13:27,699
Well, sort of.

1211
01:13:28,951 --> 01:13:32,454
See, I wore my crystal out
testing the time travel.

1212
01:13:32,621 --> 01:13:34,790
Wore myself out too. It took a while...

1213
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:37,292
Turns out, this isn't an exact science.

1214
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:40,045
This is as far back in time as I could get.

1215
01:13:40,170 --> 01:13:42,339
Come on. Help me configure the engine.

1216
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,757
It should look familiar.

1217
01:13:43,924 --> 01:13:45,926
Wait, is this based on the turnip?

1218
01:13:46,051 --> 01:13:47,719
Set it for reverse thrusters, full.

1219
01:13:50,347 --> 01:13:51,849
So, we designed all of this?

1220
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,601
Oh, no, this is all borrowed.

1221
01:13:54,726 --> 01:13:56,478
I just made some modifications.

1222
01:14:02,693 --> 01:14:05,279
She'll get to be a space
ranger again, Buzz.

1223
01:14:06,947 --> 01:14:07,990
Yeah.

1224
01:14:08,365 --> 01:14:09,366
Although...

1225
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:10,575
What?

1226
01:14:10,617 --> 01:14:13,537
Well, she won't have her family.

1227
01:14:14,121 --> 01:14:15,163
She won't have Izzy.

1228
01:14:15,330 --> 01:14:16,498
Who's Izzy?

1229
01:14:17,249 --> 01:14:22,629
Look, she's not gonna miss anyone if she
never meets them in the first place, right?

1230
01:14:23,922 --> 01:14:27,593
The only thing people are gonna know
is that we finished our mission.

1231
01:14:29,052 --> 01:14:31,180
Here. Hand me your crystal.

1232
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,142
Buzz?

1233
01:14:36,143 --> 01:14:37,603
I don't know, maybe...

1234
01:14:38,020 --> 01:14:39,521
maybe we should think about this.

1235
01:14:39,688 --> 01:14:41,064
Think about what?

1236
01:14:41,231 --> 01:14:44,443
Commander Hawthorne believed
we could fix this mistake we made.

1237
01:14:44,943 --> 01:14:47,321
And that belief cost her everything.

1238
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:50,324
Oh, no. No, no. We had that all wrong.

1239
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:52,201
She had a whole life down there.

1240
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:53,952
What kind of life?

1241
01:14:54,912 --> 01:14:57,080
We're supposed to be space rangers.

1242
01:14:57,748 --> 01:14:59,291
We're supposed to matter.

1243
01:15:00,083 --> 01:15:02,544
You don't wanna live like this, Buzz.

1244
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:05,839
Waking up with that same nightmare...

1245
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:08,342
haunted by your mistake.

1246
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:10,886
But you can finally let go of that.

1247
01:15:11,345 --> 01:15:13,013
Starting right now.

1248
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:16,558
You're right.

1249
01:15:17,684 --> 01:15:19,061
I can.

1250
01:15:20,938 --> 01:15:21,939
Where you going?

1251
01:15:22,648 --> 01:15:24,525
You and me, we're not the same.

1252
01:15:25,192 --> 01:15:26,777
I'm sorry.

1253
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:28,111
No, Buzz.

1254
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,113
I'm sorry.

1255
01:15:43,293 --> 01:15:44,293
Hey, Cat.

1256
01:15:44,419 --> 01:15:45,921
Do you know how to fly this thing?

1257
01:15:46,088 --> 01:15:47,297
There's no fuel.

1258
01:15:47,464 --> 01:15:50,384
See? This is why we should never
have gotten in over our heads.

1259
01:15:50,592 --> 01:15:51,592
What did you wanna do?

1260
01:15:51,677 --> 01:15:53,363
Wait at the outpost
until the robots found us?

1261
01:15:53,387 --> 01:15:55,156
Well, that's better
than being stranded out here...

1262
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:56,540
where no one's ever gonna find us.

1263
01:15:56,682 --> 01:15:59,977
You are the last person I wanna be
stuck with in a life-and-death situation.

1264
01:16:00,102 --> 01:16:01,228
Well, you're in luck, okay?

1265
01:16:01,436 --> 01:16:03,689
'Cause look around.
This is just a "death" situation.

1266
01:16:03,856 --> 01:16:05,607
Meow, meow, meow.

1267
01:16:07,192 --> 01:16:08,694
I've completely lost Buzz.

1268
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:11,113
He's too far away to track.

1269
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:28,964
Everybody! Inside!

1270
01:16:29,089 --> 01:16:30,089
What?

1271
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:32,509
Get inside the ship.

1272
01:16:35,220 --> 01:16:36,263
What's after us now?

1273
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:37,574
We don't have any more weapons.

1274
01:16:37,598 --> 01:16:39,038
It's okay. We're getting outta here.

1275
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,184
Where are we going?

1276
01:16:40,350 --> 01:16:41,768
We're goin' to space.

1277
01:16:45,397 --> 01:16:47,149
Hey! Let go of me. No!

1278
01:16:48,650 --> 01:16:51,695
I don't understand
what's happening here, Buzz.

1279
01:16:52,070 --> 01:16:53,530
You've changed.

1280
01:16:53,739 --> 01:16:55,741
And not for the better.

1281
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:56,909
No!

1282
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:59,870
You can't do this.
You're gonna erase it all.

1283
01:17:00,329 --> 01:17:01,413
Exactly.

1284
01:17:02,456 --> 01:17:04,374
No, you're gonna take away everything.

1285
01:17:04,499 --> 01:17:06,919
People's families, their friends.

1286
01:17:07,127 --> 01:17:08,504
My friends.

1287
01:17:08,962 --> 01:17:10,672
They have lives on that planet.

1288
01:17:10,839 --> 01:17:12,299
Everyone does.

1289
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:14,092
Except for us.

1290
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,055
I hardly recognize you, Buzz.

1291
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:21,099
All these new ideas...

1292
01:17:21,558 --> 01:17:22,809
You know what?

1293
01:17:22,976 --> 01:17:25,020
We'll go ahead and erase those too.

1294
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:28,854
I bought you five minutes.

1295
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,024
Why?

1296
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:31,318
I like this new you.

1297
01:17:33,195 --> 01:17:34,988
We have to destroy this ship.

1298
01:17:35,405 --> 01:17:36,565
Can you get me to the bridge?

1299
01:17:36,740 --> 01:17:37,783
Certainly. Follow me.

1300
01:17:49,711 --> 01:17:52,047
Operation Surprise Party, here we go.

1301
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:55,676
We need to protect our escape ship.

1302
01:17:55,843 --> 01:17:57,683
So don't let any robots
come through that door.

1303
01:17:57,845 --> 01:17:59,085
Don't worry. We'll seal it off.

1304
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:00,222
You go find Buzz.

1305
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:01,829
I'll track the chip in his dog tags.

1306
01:18:01,932 --> 01:18:03,100
Meow, meow, meow.

1307
01:18:04,268 --> 01:18:05,269
What's wrong?

1308
01:18:05,477 --> 01:18:08,063
I'm getting two Buzz signals.
That can't be right.

1309
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:10,732
I'll triangulate.
That'll get us close enough. Come on.

1310
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,235
A shortcut back.

1311
01:18:18,115 --> 01:18:19,116
Whoop.

1312
01:18:21,743 --> 01:18:22,744
Well, that's pretty neat.

1313
01:18:22,911 --> 01:18:23,704
We have to go.

1314
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:24,872
Yep, all right.

1315
01:18:33,213 --> 01:18:34,214
Ah, great.

1316
01:18:34,339 --> 01:18:36,175
I don't know any of these controls.

1317
01:18:36,341 --> 01:18:37,342
Wait. I.V.A.N.?

1318
01:18:37,509 --> 01:18:38,509
Yes, Captain?

1319
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:40,345
Boy, am I glad to see you.

1320
01:18:40,512 --> 01:18:42,764
Initiate self-destruct sequence
in two minutes.

1321
01:18:42,973 --> 01:18:45,559
You got it.
Self-destruct countdown initiated.

1322
01:18:45,726 --> 01:18:48,270
Buzz, you don't want
any of this cool technology?

1323
01:18:48,395 --> 01:18:49,980
Only you, buddy. Come on.

1324
01:18:50,564 --> 01:18:51,815
- Traitor!
- No!

1325
01:18:53,901 --> 01:18:54,943
Enough.

1326
01:18:57,404 --> 01:18:59,865
Just tell me where the crystal is.

1327
01:19:00,908 --> 01:19:02,628
Okay, we've got to protect our escape ship.

1328
01:19:02,826 --> 01:19:04,161
So how do we close this door?

1329
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:05,286
I don't know.

1330
01:19:05,370 --> 01:19:06,848
What? You said,
"Don't worry, we'll seal it off."

1331
01:19:06,872 --> 01:19:08,582
Right. So, don't worry. We will.

1332
01:19:09,917 --> 01:19:10,918
Here we go.

1333
01:19:11,251 --> 01:19:12,586
Look. See?

1334
01:19:12,920 --> 01:19:13,921
What?

1335
01:19:20,302 --> 01:19:21,345
Meow, meow, meow.

1336
01:19:21,553 --> 01:19:23,138
Oh! The signal is tighter now.

1337
01:19:23,263 --> 01:19:24,503
He has to be straight this way.

1338
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:28,268
That's a lot of space.

1339
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:30,354
Keep it together. Keep it together.

1340
01:19:30,938 --> 01:19:32,314
No, no, no!

1341
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:36,860
I don't understand.
The signal says Buzz is 50 meters away.

1342
01:19:37,819 --> 01:19:39,696
He's over there.

1343
01:19:41,281 --> 01:19:42,991
You think we're not the same, Buzz?

1344
01:19:43,158 --> 01:19:46,161
You're already me.
You just don't know it yet.

1345
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:47,746
I'm never gonna be you!

1346
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:51,250
Well, if you're not gonna be me,
you're not gonna be anyone.

1347
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:56,797
Artificial gravity disengaged.

1348
01:19:57,089 --> 01:19:58,215
Blast.

1349
01:19:59,132 --> 01:20:00,133
No, no, no.

1350
01:20:05,472 --> 01:20:07,307
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Building a bomb.

1351
01:20:07,474 --> 01:20:08,559
Nice. Do you need a pen?

1352
01:20:08,725 --> 01:20:09,725
No. Here.

1353
01:20:10,894 --> 01:20:11,895
Aw, thank you.

1354
01:20:12,479 --> 01:20:13,480
Peppermint.

1355
01:20:13,689 --> 01:20:14,731
Give me the wrapper.

1356
01:20:14,940 --> 01:20:17,234
So, you can just build a bomb
out of that stuff?

1357
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:19,037
I've worked with less.
Now, give me the gum.

1358
01:20:19,069 --> 01:20:21,214
Wait. I'm not done.
There's still a lot of flavor left.

1359
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:22,239
Come on!

1360
01:20:23,615 --> 01:20:26,326
There. When they step on it,
it'll blow up.

1361
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:27,651
What if they don't step on it?

1362
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:29,663
I mean, I wouldn't step on that. Would you?

1363
01:20:30,622 --> 01:20:32,875
Then we need to drop
something heavy on it.

1364
01:20:39,339 --> 01:20:40,924
- Just gonna...
- No!

1365
01:20:50,684 --> 01:20:51,727
Buzz?

1366
01:20:51,894 --> 01:20:53,103
Buzz!

1367
01:20:53,312 --> 01:20:54,312
Alisha?

1368
01:20:55,731 --> 01:20:57,274
Are you okay?

1369
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:03,030
No. I can't do it alone. I need help.

1370
01:21:03,363 --> 01:21:06,450
Buzz. I'm not my grandma.

1371
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:11,121
Izzy, I don't need your grandma.
I need you.

1372
01:21:13,415 --> 01:21:14,917
Sox. How do we get over there?

1373
01:21:15,083 --> 01:21:16,084
Through the airlock.

1374
01:21:17,336 --> 01:21:18,378
Through there?

1375
01:21:18,504 --> 01:21:19,630
There's nothing out there.

1376
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,590
Exactly. Nothing in your way.

1377
01:21:21,757 --> 01:21:23,217
You just go straight across.

1378
01:21:23,383 --> 01:21:24,384
No!

1379
01:21:27,179 --> 01:21:28,907
Let me get this straight,
when this falls on your bomb...

1380
01:21:28,931 --> 01:21:30,158
- it'll definitely explode?
- Yes.

1381
01:21:30,182 --> 01:21:31,542
- And that'll seal the door?
- Yes.

1382
01:21:31,808 --> 01:21:32,809
Well, we better hurry.

1383
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:34,269
I am hurrying.

1384
01:21:34,811 --> 01:21:36,480
Why don't you hurry?

1385
01:21:37,940 --> 01:21:39,066
Come on.

1386
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:52,620
Okay.

1387
01:21:55,332 --> 01:21:57,543
Come on, come on, Izzy, come on.

1388
01:21:57,709 --> 01:21:59,419
You got this.

1389
01:22:00,629 --> 01:22:02,214
Oh, man.

1390
01:22:04,675 --> 01:22:06,009
Oh, no.

1391
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:10,722
Just don't look down.
Or up. It's all space.

1392
01:22:11,265 --> 01:22:13,225
It's everywhere. All around you.

1393
01:22:13,976 --> 01:22:15,853
I'm sorry.
I'm probably not helping.

1394
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:17,229
Just go straight.

1395
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:20,732
Once you push off,
that's the direction you'll go.

1396
01:22:21,692 --> 01:22:23,151
But what if I miss?

1397
01:22:23,735 --> 01:22:24,820
Don't miss.

1398
01:22:58,270 --> 01:22:59,270
Oh, no.

1399
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,939
No, no, no!

1400
01:23:09,573 --> 01:23:10,573
Whoa!

1401
01:23:11,909 --> 01:23:13,243
Sox!

1402
01:23:19,541 --> 01:23:20,542
Thank you, Izzy.

1403
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:37,267
There's no way in.

1404
01:23:37,434 --> 01:23:38,602
Perhaps I could help.

1405
01:23:46,568 --> 01:23:48,612
You can't hide from me, Buzz.

1406
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:50,822
It's like hiding from yourself.

1407
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:52,866
I'll always find you.

1408
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,352
Manual override activated.

1409
01:24:33,782 --> 01:24:34,867
- Buzz!
- Now!

1410
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:43,166
Come on, let's get outta here.

1411
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,418
We have to blow up the ship.

1412
01:24:44,585 --> 01:24:46,025
There's no time.
We'll never make it.

1413
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,629
Oh, yes, we will.

1414
01:24:55,637 --> 01:24:59,141
Self-destruct sequence complete in ten...

1415
01:24:59,933 --> 01:25:02,019
- nine, eight...
- I.V.A.N.? I.V.A.N.!

1416
01:25:05,814 --> 01:25:06,934
Darby, we have to surrender.

1417
01:25:07,065 --> 01:25:09,276
No! I am not giving up.

1418
01:25:09,401 --> 01:25:11,528
Yep, neither am I. Hold on.

1419
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:21,580
- ...five, four...
- Let's go.

1420
01:25:22,206 --> 01:25:24,583
- ...three, two...
- Everyone, get in.

1421
01:25:24,917 --> 01:25:25,959
...one.

1422
01:26:21,765 --> 01:26:22,933
Buzz Light year mission log.

1423
01:26:23,100 --> 01:26:25,686
We've destroyed the Zurg ship,
and Zurg himself.

1424
01:26:25,811 --> 01:26:28,313
Now I just have to catch up
to the Armadillo in order to...

1425
01:26:29,690 --> 01:26:31,233
Going somewhere?

1426
01:26:32,401 --> 01:26:34,695
Warning, engine damage is catastrophic.

1427
01:26:36,738 --> 01:26:40,742
Buzz Light year mission log.
I now have the crystal in my possession...

1428
01:26:41,285 --> 01:26:45,914
and can finally, at long last,
finish the mission.

1429
01:26:46,164 --> 01:26:48,667
I'm gonna go back and matter again, Buzz.

1430
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,252
And you?

1431
01:26:50,419 --> 01:26:52,880
It will be like you were never here.

1432
01:26:53,589 --> 01:26:56,508
So, prepare to die.

1433
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:03,473
Not today, Zurg.

1434
01:27:12,274 --> 01:27:14,276
We've entered the planet's
gravitational pull.

1435
01:27:14,401 --> 01:27:15,402
Are we gonna crash?

1436
01:27:15,527 --> 01:27:16,653
I'm afraid so.

1437
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:31,293
Buzz!

1438
01:27:45,015 --> 01:27:46,225
I can't do it.

1439
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:48,185
Buzz, it's okay.

1440
01:27:48,435 --> 01:27:49,435
We can.

1441
01:27:50,437 --> 01:27:51,855
Can you keep the ship steady?

1442
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:53,857
Yeah. I think so.

1443
01:27:57,402 --> 01:28:01,490
Okay. Sox, use the emergency battery
to power up flight controls.

1444
01:28:01,907 --> 01:28:02,908
Got it.

1445
01:28:03,992 --> 01:28:04,993
I'll need a copilot.

1446
01:28:06,036 --> 01:28:08,163
Okay. But I've only done this
in the simulator.

1447
01:28:08,413 --> 01:28:09,915
Well, it's about to get real.

1448
01:28:10,082 --> 01:28:12,626
Remember, pull back on the yoke
nice and...

1449
01:28:14,378 --> 01:28:16,922
- easy.
- Yep, sorry. Nice and easy from now on.

1450
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,092
It's not working.

1451
01:28:20,217 --> 01:28:21,844
We're coming in too fast.

1452
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:23,136
- I.V.A.N.
- Yes, Captain?

1453
01:28:23,303 --> 01:28:25,389
- We're going too fast.
- Congratulations!

1454
01:28:26,807 --> 01:28:28,809
We don't need confetti.
We need brakes!

1455
01:28:28,892 --> 01:28:29,643
I know!

1456
01:28:29,810 --> 01:28:31,478
- The air brake!
- On the floor.

1457
01:28:31,603 --> 01:28:32,688
Darby!

1458
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:35,399
- It's stuck.
- What?

1459
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:36,942
The cover, it's stuck.

1460
01:28:37,109 --> 01:28:39,069
I need a screwdriver.
Or a hair clip.

1461
01:28:39,236 --> 01:28:40,863
Or some sort of a small wedge.

1462
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:43,574
I've got the pen!

1463
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:04,970
- Buzz!
- Is everyone okay?

1464
01:29:05,137 --> 01:29:06,138
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1465
01:29:06,346 --> 01:29:07,389
I think so.

1466
01:29:08,515 --> 01:29:10,434
The cops! Everybody run!

1467
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:13,061
Wait. It's just the rescue team.

1468
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,522
Right. Okay.

1469
01:29:16,315 --> 01:29:19,610
You seem like a decent citizen.
What led to your incarceration?

1470
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:21,403
I stole a ship.

1471
01:29:22,613 --> 01:29:26,450
Well, who among us hasn't stolen a ship
in a moment of...

1472
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:28,285
relative desperation?

1473
01:29:28,535 --> 01:29:31,747
I'm a man of resources.
My weapon is ingenuity.

1474
01:29:31,914 --> 01:29:33,207
I can do anything!

1475
01:29:33,415 --> 01:29:34,708
Can you not shout in my ear?

1476
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:35,959
Yep, sorry.

1477
01:29:46,678 --> 01:29:47,679
You okay?

1478
01:29:49,431 --> 01:29:50,641
I was in space.

1479
01:29:52,434 --> 01:29:54,186
Your grandma would be proud.

1480
01:29:55,604 --> 01:29:57,105
She'd be proud of you too.

1481
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:00,817
She always was.

1482
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:05,155
Wait. Where's your crystal?

1483
01:30:05,781 --> 01:30:06,907
It's gone.

1484
01:30:07,115 --> 01:30:08,825
But your mission...

1485
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:10,744
You wanted to go home.

1486
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:14,373
You know,
for the first time in a long time...

1487
01:30:15,749 --> 01:30:17,543
I feel like I am home.

1488
01:30:26,927 --> 01:30:28,011
Look out!

1489
01:30:30,556 --> 01:30:31,556
What?

1490
01:30:37,271 --> 01:30:38,689
Stop right now.

1491
01:30:40,774 --> 01:30:42,109
Light year.

1492
01:30:43,735 --> 01:30:48,031
You absconded with Star Command property,
stole an experimental spacecraft...

1493
01:30:48,156 --> 01:30:50,450
and defied a direct order
from your commander.

1494
01:30:50,617 --> 01:30:52,703
I ought to throw you in the stockade.

1495
01:30:54,204 --> 01:30:57,749
But I have other plans for you.

1496
01:30:59,126 --> 01:31:02,379
We want you to start a new version
of the Space Ranger Corps.

1497
01:31:02,588 --> 01:31:04,715
Universe Protection Division.

1498
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:07,009
You're gonna be a space ranger again, Buzz.

1499
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:11,072
You can hand-select your team
from the very best...

1500
01:31:11,096 --> 01:31:13,724
of the Zap Patrol
and train them to your liking.

1501
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:20,731
Well, that's very kind of you, sir, but
I'm afraid I'm going to have to decline.

1502
01:31:24,735 --> 01:31:26,111
I already have my team.

1503
01:31:37,539 --> 01:31:41,043
These new suits are amazing.
Arm blaster, rocket wings.

1504
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:42,377
Could use a pen, though.

1505
01:31:42,586 --> 01:31:45,631
Can't believe I'm allowed to carry this.
I wish I had two of 'em.

1506
01:31:45,797 --> 01:31:48,217
You got a clean record,
and you're free and armed.

1507
01:31:48,383 --> 01:31:49,583
How are you still complaining?

1508
01:31:49,676 --> 01:31:52,012
I got off for good behavior,
not good attitude.

1509
01:31:52,137 --> 01:31:53,377
You know, I never wear pants...

1510
01:31:53,555 --> 01:31:55,641
but suddenly it feels weird
to not be wearing pants.

1511
01:31:55,807 --> 01:31:57,035
Does it look weird without pants?

1512
01:31:57,059 --> 01:31:58,060
No, you look good.

1513
01:31:58,393 --> 01:31:59,603
Wish I could pull that off.

1514
01:32:06,068 --> 01:32:09,279
Look, Grandma, I'm a space ranger.

1515
01:32:09,446 --> 01:32:10,906
Just like you.

1516
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:26,755
All right, team. We've picked up a signal
in the Gamma Quadrant of Sector Four.

1517
01:32:26,922 --> 01:32:30,342
We don't know what it is, but we're not
going to wait for it to invade our home.

1518
01:32:30,467 --> 01:32:32,845
Copy, Commander.
You can count on us.

1519
01:32:34,054 --> 01:32:37,391
Buzz Light year mission log,
star date 4071.

1520
01:32:37,599 --> 01:32:39,935
As members of
the elite Universe Protection Unit...

1521
01:32:40,060 --> 01:32:41,311
of the Space Ranger Corps...

1522
01:32:41,478 --> 01:32:44,165
we've been charged to protect the galaxy
from the threat of invasion...

1523
01:32:44,189 --> 01:32:47,234
from any sworn enemies
of the Galactic Alliance.

1524
01:32:47,860 --> 01:32:50,320
Okay, everyone.
Make sure you're securely fastened.

1525
01:32:50,487 --> 01:32:52,698
- Do we have everything? Munitions?
- Check.

1526
01:32:52,906 --> 01:32:54,346
- Sustenance?
- I brought sandwiches.

1527
01:32:54,491 --> 01:32:56,034
And your tummy will be okay?

1528
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,911
- All set.
- All right.

1529
01:32:59,037 --> 01:33:00,289
Am I forgetting anything?

1530
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:02,082
I think we're ready.

1531
01:33:17,014 --> 01:33:20,142
Hello. I am your Internal
Voice-Activated Navigator.

1532
01:33:20,267 --> 01:33:21,727
Good to have you back, I.V.A.N.

1533
01:33:22,144 --> 01:33:23,645
Captain Light year, ready for launch.

1534
01:33:23,937 --> 01:33:24,938
- Sox?
- Meow?

1535
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:31,653
I.V.A.N., initiate hyper launch.

1536
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:32,820
Certainly.

1537
01:33:34,448 --> 01:33:36,950
All right, space rangers.
Here we go.

1538
01:33:37,075 --> 01:33:38,243
To infinity...

1539
01:33:39,953 --> 01:33:41,163
And beyond.

1540
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:58,884
Laser shield.

1541
01:43:37,259 --> 01:43:39,303
Now, should you prefer
a more scenic route...

1542
01:43:39,469 --> 01:43:42,389
you'll want to head south
past the Bromide Swamps...

1543
01:43:42,556 --> 01:43:45,017
a breathtaking sight,
or so I am told.

1544
01:43:45,225 --> 01:43:48,645
But, if you're in a hurry,
this would be your most direct route.

1545
01:43:48,770 --> 01:43:49,980
Any questions?

1546
01:43:51,023 --> 01:43:52,024
Hello?

1547
01:43:53,305 --> 01:44:53,222
