00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:02,288
What is it that makes a man a man?

3
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:06,087
Is it his origins,
the way things start?

4
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:10,429
Or is it something else,
something harder to describe?

5
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:14,331
For me, it all began in 1944.

6
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,738
Classified mission
off the coast of Scotland.

7
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:20,303
The Nazis were desperate.

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,948
Combining science and black magic...

9
00:01:23,116 --> 00:01:26,517
...they intended to upset
the balance of the war.

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,153
I was 28, already a paranormal
advisor to President Roosevelt.

11
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,885
I could never have suspected
that what would transpire that night...

12
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,089
...would not only affect
the course of history...

13
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,962
...but change my life forever.

14
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:44,694
All right, men, let's go. Move!

15
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:52,873
Come on! Come on! Come on!

16
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,175
Let's fan it out.

17
00:02:01,327 --> 00:02:02,686
Your men...

18
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,790
...they'll need these.

19
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,025
Are you a Catholic?

20
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:12,631
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.

21
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,664
Well, you're gonna need
one of these.

22
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,230
I abhor the use of violence.

23
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,069
Thank you. I wouldn't want you
to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.

24
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,801
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.

25
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,140
All right, you guys,
let's move, move, move, move!

26
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:33,885
Come on boys, let's go!

27
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:35,577
This way! Left, right!

28
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:37,723
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!

29
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,880
We're close!

30
00:02:39,058 --> 00:02:42,391
You're wasting our time. There's
nothing here but sheep and rocks.

31
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,496
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!

32
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,122
The remains of Trondham Abbey,
built on an intersection of ley lines...

33
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:50,394
...the boundaries between
our world and the others...

34
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,504
What a load of crap!

35
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:55,902
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard
the word "parabnormal."

36
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:57,372
Paranormal.

37
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,136
Move it!

38
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,911
Hold the line.

39
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,775
Come on!

40
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,480
Sweet Jesus.

41
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,626
They must be here for the sheep.

42
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:38,339
The freak in the gas mask...

43
00:03:38,518 --> 00:03:40,986
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

44
00:03:41,754 --> 00:03:46,453
Hitler's top assassin
and head of the Thule Occult Society.

45
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,728
If he's here, this is worse
than I thought.

46
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,018
No matter what happens tonight...

47
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,183
...this book will guide you
back to me.

48
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,352
I will not leave you.

49
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:28,361
I grant you everlasting life...

50
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,727
...youth...

51
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,996
...and the power to serve me.

52
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,306
Ilsa! Grigori!

53
00:04:38,044 --> 00:04:39,033
It's time.

54
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:53,091
Five years of research
and construction, Grigori.

55
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,556
Five years!

56
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:57,059
The führer doesn't look kindly
on failure.

57
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:59,926
There will be no failure, general.

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,030
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.

59
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,099
I'll deliver one.

60
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,052
What I will do tonight
can never be undone!

61
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:21,020
What I will do tonight
can never be undone!

62
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:23,280
I will open a portal...

63
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,315
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:

64
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,188
The Seven Gods of Chaos!

65
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,460
Our enemies will be destroyed!

66
00:05:32,632 --> 00:05:34,793
And from the ashes...

67
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:39,334
...a new Eden will arise.

68
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:05,718
Get down!

69
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,088
I was taking a picture.

70
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,891
You do that again
and I'll carve you a new one.

71
00:07:13,065 --> 00:07:15,295
Listen, the portal is open.

72
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,528
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.

73
00:07:50,269 --> 00:07:51,736
Go! Go! Go! Go!

74
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,485
Look out!

75
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,493
Get down!

76
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,232
It's almost over.

77
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,877
No, it's not.

78
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,373
The portal's been open for too long.

79
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,710
Something may have come through.

80
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,877
Have your men search
the area thoroughly.

81
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,222
Spread out over that way!

82
00:09:57,964 --> 00:10:00,694
Sir! Something up here!

83
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,364
He's gone.

84
00:10:04,537 --> 00:10:06,505
For now.

85
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:11,701
When you said something
came through...

86
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:13,943
From where?

87
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,616
I don't see them!

88
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,024
Do you really, really believe in hell?

89
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,465
There is a place,
a dark place...

90
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,662
...where ancient evil slumbers
and waits to return.

91
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:43,002
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?

92
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,776
That's Russian, right?

93
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,277
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.

94
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,539
Rasputin?

95
00:10:49,715 --> 00:10:53,151
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.

96
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,117
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...

97
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:01,191
...he was poisoned, shot,
stabbed, clubbed...

98
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:04,386
...castrated and finally drowned.

99
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,964
And yet, we saw him here tonight.

100
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,192
Professor Broom.

101
00:11:14,306 --> 00:11:16,137
Careful. Be careful.

102
00:11:39,498 --> 00:11:41,591
- What the hell is that? An ape?
- No.

103
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:44,292
It was red. Bright red.

104
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,438
Lower your light, you're scaring it.

105
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:50,270
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!

106
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,968
No, it's not an ape.

107
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:55,978
It's got a big stone in its hand.

108
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:59,049
I think that is its hand.

109
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,448
Look at the size of that whammer.

110
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,422
No, wait! Wait!

111
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,492
A blanket. Get me a blanket.

112
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,628
Come on. Come on. It's safe.

113
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:49,958
Jump down.

114
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,400
Come on. Jump down.

115
00:12:57,076 --> 00:12:58,737
It's a boy.

116
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,845
It's just a baby boy.

117
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,080
Move to the left.

118
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:15,523
There we were, an unready father
for an unwanted child.

119
00:13:16,395 --> 00:13:19,193
The boys gave him a name
that very night.

120
00:13:19,365 --> 00:13:22,630
In retrospect,
perhaps not the most fortunate.

121
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:26,568
But nevertheless,
a name we all came to use.

122
00:13:26,772 --> 00:13:30,208
We called him Hellboy.

123
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,712
Look at the birdie.

124
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,887
Speculation about the origins...

125
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:56,396
Evidence that Hellboy...

126
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,776
So, what is it exactly
that you say this agency does?

127
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:16,248
I kid you not. It hunts monsters.

128
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,357
The claim, of course,
that this creature...

129
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:28,693
...works for the FBI
as a monster hunter.

130
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,339
What you seek is in there.

131
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,656
This is a sacred place.

132
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,496
Give me my gold.

133
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,932
We shouldn't be here.

134
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:12,896
Master.

135
00:17:16,068 --> 00:17:18,093
Your eyes.

136
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,970
What did they do to your eyes?

137
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,348
- Have you told him yet?
- No.

138
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,576
We should.

139
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,228
Malignant sarcoma.

140
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,657
In the lungs...

141
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,730
...the spine...

142
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,700
...liver.
- Approximately...

143
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,270
...how long?
- Maybe six weeks.

144
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:02,403
I can arrange for hospitalization
and pain management.

145
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,779
- Make the time more bearable.
- No.

146
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,250
I'd rather be at home.

147
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,121
I have some arrangements to make.

148
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,655
For my son.

149
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,625
You can always get
a second opinion.

150
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:26,126
That won't be necessary.

151
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,634
Hurry up!

152
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,413
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!

153
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,975
Tom Manning is the head
of special operations at the FBI.

154
00:18:40,152 --> 00:18:43,883
He joins Pat in the studio tonight
to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.

155
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,889
There. That's the tail.

156
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:49,050
And these are the horns.

157
00:18:49,228 --> 00:18:50,354
I have a question.

158
00:18:52,998 --> 00:18:56,593
In the pictures of aliens, UFO,
the yeti, Hellboy...

159
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,566
...why is it they're always out of focus?

160
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:01,665
Why don't you tell us...

161
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,775
...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?

162
00:19:04,943 --> 00:19:08,003
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell
the American public one thing.

163
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,841
Now, this Bureau for the...

164
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:13,109
Paranormal Research and Defense.

165
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:19,623
There is no such thing.

166
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,740
"Waste Management Services"?

167
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:41,506
What is it?

168
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,709
John Myers, FBI.

169
00:19:44,917 --> 00:19:47,078
Transfer from Quantico.

170
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,547
Look at the birdie, son.

171
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:15,608
- Hello. I'm John...
- You are late. That's what you are.

172
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,274
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.

173
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:22,682
- I'm going to...
- Section 51. I know.

174
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,248
Watch your hands and elbows.

175
00:20:25,424 --> 00:20:27,915
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.

176
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:56,882
Hello?

177
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:06,492
Turn the pages, please,
if you don't mind.

178
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,771
Please.

179
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,773
The pages.

180
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,775
These? You're reading these?

181
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:17,776
Four books at once, every day...

182
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,278
Four books at once, every day...

183
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:19,778
Four books at once, every day...

184
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,781
...as long as I'm there
to turn the pages.

185
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:23,782
My name's Broom.

186
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:24,650
My name's Broom.

187
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:26,411
Professor Trevor Broom.

188
00:21:26,585 --> 00:21:27,574
Sir, I'm John...

189
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:30,119
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.

190
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,587
T stands for Thaddeus,
mother's older brother.

191
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:34,953
Scar on your chin happened
when you were 10.

192
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,960
You still wonder if it's ever
going to fade away.

193
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,893
- How did it...?
- He.

194
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,194
Not "it."

195
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:45,393
Abraham Sapien.

196
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:49,131
Discovered alive
in a secret chamber...

197
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,141
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.

198
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,438
His name was taken
from this inscription...

199
00:21:54,613 --> 00:21:57,207
...stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.

200
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,942
April 14, 1865."

201
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:02,914
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.

202
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:05,487
Hence, Abe Sapien.

203
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,189
Rotten eggs.

204
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:11,893
A delicacy. Abe loves them.

205
00:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,157
How does he know
so much about me?

206
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,564
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.

207
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:23,271
"Unique." That's a word you'll hear
frequently around here.

208
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:28,976
Sir, where am I, exactly?

209
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,678
As you entered the lobby,
there was an inscription:

210
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:37,447
"In the absence of light,
darkness prevails."

211
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,023
There are things that go bump
in the night, Agent Myers.

212
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,785
Make no mistake about that.

213
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:47,359
And we are the ones
who bump back.

214
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:54,868
1937, Hitler joins
the Thule Society...

215
00:22:55,073 --> 00:22:58,770
...a group of German aristocrats
obsessed with the occult.

216
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:03,313
1938, he acquired
the Spear of Longinus...

217
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,313
...which pierced the side of Christ.

218
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:07,577
He who holds it becomes invincible.

219
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:10,620
Hitler's power increases tenfold.

220
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:14,589
1943, President Roosevelt
decides to fight back.

221
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,887
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.

222
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:21,563
1958, the Occult Wars
finally come to an end...

223
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,224
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.

224
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,565
1945, you mean.

225
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,396
Hitler died in '45.

226
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:32,107
Did he, now?

227
00:23:34,846 --> 00:23:37,576
Myers, this is Agent Clay.

228
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:39,114
Take his lead.

229
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,283
He'll make the introductions.

230
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,015
You're not coming?

231
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:52,829
I handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.

232
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,590
Make me proud.

233
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,598
They're not speaking.

234
00:23:58,336 --> 00:24:00,236
Professor Broom had him grounded.

235
00:24:00,405 --> 00:24:02,737
Grounded? Who's grounded?

236
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:14,408
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?

237
00:24:14,586 --> 00:24:16,747
Oh, yeah. That was weird.

238
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,622
Yeah. Right.

239
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:29,230
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.

240
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:31,635
He gets fed six times a day.

241
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:33,327
He's got a thing for cats.

242
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:36,440
You'll be his nanny,
his keeper, his best friend.

243
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,274
He never goes out unsupervised.

244
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,433
Who?

245
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,247
I hate those comic books.

246
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,449
They never get the eyes right.

247
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,953
Hellboy.

248
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:00,753
He's real.

249
00:25:00,932 --> 00:25:04,368
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.

250
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:07,903
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.

251
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,472
What's with the hair, Clay?

252
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,804
Finally got them implants, huh?

253
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,979
It'll fill in.

254
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:16,641
Who's the squirt?

255
00:25:17,449 --> 00:25:19,644
Agent Myers is your new liaison.

256
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:23,984
I don't want him.

257
00:25:25,156 --> 00:25:27,317
What, you get tired of me, Clay?

258
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:29,860
The candy. Give him the candy.

259
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,121
Oh, sir, I...

260
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,128
I have these for you.

261
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:36,660
Father's back?

262
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:41,429
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.

263
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:42,800
I wanted to see her.

264
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:46,802
- Nobody's business.
- It is. You got yourself on TV again.

265
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:48,806
Myers, huh?

266
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,546
You got a first name, Myers?

267
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,446
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.

268
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:58,022
John. John Myers.

269
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,123
Well, John'll do.

270
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:04,456
- Stare at what?
- His horns. He files them to fit in.

271
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:14,369
What you looking at, John?

272
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:19,739
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

273
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,242
Code red.

274
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,402
Hey, hey, hey.

275
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,912
Warning. Code red.

276
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,447
They're playing our song.

277
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:29,183
Come on, champ,
let's go fight some monsters.

278
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:37,395
We're here at the Machen Library...

279
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,326
...where just hours ago,
an alarm was triggered.

280
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:43,433
The N.Y.P.D. Has yet
to issue a statement.

281
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:47,038
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.

282
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:49,298
And now here comes
a garbage truck.

283
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,465
A large garbage truck.

284
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,538
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.

285
00:26:56,715 --> 00:26:59,343
One sheet of glass
between them and us.

286
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:01,314
Story of my life.

287
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,946
Outside.
I could be outside.

288
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,022
You mean, outside with her.

289
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:12,459
Don't get psychic with me, fella.

290
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,496
Nothing psychic about it.

291
00:27:14,866 --> 00:27:16,163
You're easy.

292
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,303
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.

293
00:27:21,272 --> 00:27:22,739
Liz left us, Red.

294
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:24,675
Take the hint.

295
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,743
We don't take hints.

296
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:38,189
Civilians in bedroom.

297
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,569
Okay, guys,
let's sync up our locators.

298
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:10,152
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.

299
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,453
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.

300
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:17,061
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.

301
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,388
Six guards dead.

302
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:20,360
I thought we checked this place.

303
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:21,999
Fakes and reproductions.

304
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,965
Apparently, not everything was fake.

305
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,204
Father.

306
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:38,242
The entity is still in there.

307
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:43,319
Video surveillance shows
a 16th-century statue was destroyed.

308
00:28:43,621 --> 00:28:45,680
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.

309
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:48,621
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.

310
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:53,061
The statue, however, was hollow.

311
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,331
A reliquary.

312
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,265
A prison.

313
00:28:57,435 --> 00:29:00,666
The Vatican deemed its occupant
dangerous enough...

314
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:05,435
...to include it on The List of Avignon,
of which, by the way, we hold a copy.

315
00:29:05,610 --> 00:29:07,874
Perfect job for these babies.

316
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,603
Made them myself.

317
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:14,246
Holy water, clove leaf, silver
shavings, white oak. The works.

318
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,923
Behind this door, a dark entity.

319
00:29:22,727 --> 00:29:26,493
Evil, ancient and hungry.

320
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:30,532
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.

321
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:01,798
You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.

322
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:04,992
We'll definitely need
more info on this one.

323
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:07,331
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.

324
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:09,871
No. He likes it that way.

325
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:13,408
The whole "lonely hero" thing.

326
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,324
Hey, Stinky.

327
00:30:32,797 --> 00:30:34,424
Kitchen's closed.

328
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:36,556
What you having?

329
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,228
Six library guards, raw,
plus belts and boots.

330
00:30:40,405 --> 00:30:44,569
Man, you're gonna need
some heavy fiber to move that out.

331
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,607
Red, I found something.

332
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:49,809
This entity's name is Sammael,
the desolate one.

333
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,710
Son of Nergal, brother of...

334
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:06,754
Listen, Sammy...

335
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:11,292
...I'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.

336
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:23,812
So, what do you say we work this out
in a nice, peaceful...

337
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,649
Oh, crap.

338
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,161
That's it for you, Sam.

339
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:46,297
Red, you need to hear
the rest of the information.

340
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,731
No, he's taken care of.

341
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,841
No, listen to this.

342
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:55,210
"Sammael, the desolate one,
lord of the shadows...

343
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,315
...son of Nergal,
hound of resurrection..."

344
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:03,082
See...

345
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,551
...I don't like that.

346
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,553
What? Hound of resurrection?

347
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:10,186
"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc..."

348
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:12,727
Cut to the end. How do I kill it?

349
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,262
Doesn't say.

350
00:32:20,371 --> 00:32:22,032
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!

351
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:23,833
I'm going around the back.

352
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,226
Oh, crap.

353
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,196
Child.

354
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,668
All grown up, I see.

355
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,569
That voice.

356
00:32:57,275 --> 00:33:00,369
It was the first lullaby
you ever heard, my son.

357
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,070
I ushered you into this world.

358
00:33:03,247 --> 00:33:07,013
I alone know your true calling,
your true name.

359
00:33:07,685 --> 00:33:09,084
Name this.

360
00:33:28,906 --> 00:33:31,773
- That thing. That thing.
- What do you think you're doing?

361
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,503
- What do you think you're doing?
- Helping you. I...

362
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:36,271
Nobody helps me!

363
00:33:36,447 --> 00:33:37,880
It's my job.

364
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,547
You want to help? Here.
Load this.

365
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,694
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.

366
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,699
Jesus, what's that on your arm?

367
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,200
Oh, crap.

368
00:34:01,939 --> 00:34:03,804
What the hell is that thing?

369
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:05,899
Let me go ask.

370
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,429
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.

371
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:35,469
Why, you little...

372
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,654
Wait!

373
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,793
We're heading toward civilians.

374
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:15,674
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.

375
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,608
Red means stop!

376
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:02,017
- You all right?
- Yeah.

377
00:36:02,193 --> 00:36:04,286
Stay here.

378
00:36:15,106 --> 00:36:18,542
Sammy, you got a leak.

379
00:36:25,082 --> 00:36:27,778
Waiting for me, chunk-face?

380
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:34,947
What the...?

381
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:12,655
- I'm on your side.
- Sure.

382
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,968
That's right!

383
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,323
Open wide!

384
00:37:49,066 --> 00:37:50,055
Son of a...

385
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:55,864
Yuck!

386
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,871
Screw this.

387
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,087
I'm fireproof.

388
00:38:14,892 --> 00:38:16,860
You're not.

389
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:25,758
Hey, Myers.

390
00:38:26,504 --> 00:38:28,199
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

391
00:38:28,372 --> 00:38:30,033
How's your arm?

392
00:38:30,207 --> 00:38:33,267
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?

393
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:35,412
I just fried Stinky.

394
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,240
Listen...

395
00:38:37,515 --> 00:38:39,039
...tell Father I'll be home...

396
00:38:39,216 --> 00:38:40,649
...but he shouldn't wait up.

397
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,217
No. No, wait, wait.

398
00:38:42,386 --> 00:38:43,819
Yeah, I gotta go with you.

399
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,548
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?

400
00:38:48,626 --> 00:38:50,355
Bye.

401
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,392
Damn it.

402
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:11,105
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.

403
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,903
Die in peace...

404
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,514
...and be reborn again and again.

405
00:40:22,686 --> 00:40:25,951
Only seven more days
till the eclipse.

406
00:40:26,123 --> 00:40:30,253
The child will be there,
and so will we all.

407
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,323
Won't we?

408
00:41:21,512 --> 00:41:23,810
There's a big, red man down there.

409
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:26,848
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.

410
00:41:27,017 --> 00:41:28,780
Not Santa.

411
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:30,716
Well, who, then?

412
00:41:41,765 --> 00:41:43,528
I brought beer.

413
00:41:43,901 --> 00:41:45,835
Oh, Red, your arm.

414
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:49,529
You better get that looked at.

415
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,209
I wanted to see you.

416
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,476
Every time the media gets
a look at him, they run to me.

417
00:42:26,644 --> 00:42:28,236
I'm running out of lies, Trevor.

418
00:42:28,412 --> 00:42:30,972
- I thought you like being on TV.
- I do.

419
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:34,843
So how many escapes
this year alone? Five.

420
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,249
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.

421
00:42:37,421 --> 00:42:41,653
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red,
has a tail and is government-funded.

422
00:42:41,825 --> 00:42:43,190
I know where to find him.

423
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,323
- I'll get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.

424
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,790
Don't touch anything.

425
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,160
I need to touch it to see.

426
00:42:50,334 --> 00:42:53,462
- See what?
- Past, future.

427
00:42:54,338 --> 00:42:57,000
Whatever this object holds.

428
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:58,300
Is he serious?

429
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:01,444
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.

430
00:43:03,647 --> 00:43:06,548
Professor, they were here.

431
00:43:09,787 --> 00:43:13,245
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?

432
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:15,324
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?

433
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:19,155
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.

434
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:36,739
This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.

435
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,942
Also, make sure it's all locked up
over there in the annex.

436
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,244
Roger that.

437
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:12,809
Kroenen!

438
00:44:13,784 --> 00:44:14,944
Move.

439
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,126
Move!

440
00:44:32,636 --> 00:44:33,796
There he is!

441
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,143
We'll cover him from here!

442
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:48,583
All right, don't move! Put that down.

443
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:50,613
Put down the weapon!

444
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:51,977
Get them.

445
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,748
Drop the weapon.

446
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,753
On the ground!

447
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:03,790
Last warning!

448
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:11,434
Take him out!

449
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:41,471
Now, ready the welcome, my love.

450
00:45:46,944 --> 00:45:52,143
Salt gathered from the tears
of a thousand angels.

451
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,640
Restraining the essence...

452
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:58,049
...of Sammael, the hellhound.

453
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:02,356
The seed of destruction.

454
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:15,931
This I can promise, Sammael.

455
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:20,034
For each one of you that falls...

456
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,700
...two shall arise.

457
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:59,412
- Professor.
- I'm all right.

458
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:02,849
Professor.

459
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:07,484
You...

460
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,224
You are very sick.

461
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:15,623
I don't want Hellboy to know.

462
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:21,226
Sixty years ago,
they tried to destroy the world.

463
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:22,929
They're back.

464
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:27,068
In my lifetime, they're back...

465
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,174
...to finish the job.

466
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,911
We miss you at the bureau.

467
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,349
Abe's crazier every day.

468
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,751
Father's still mad at me.

469
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:45,791
Come back, Liz.

470
00:47:45,963 --> 00:47:48,693
- Come back.
- No. No, H.B.

471
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,097
No, not this time.

472
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,301
I don't like it here...

473
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:00,701
...but I haven't had an episode
in months.

474
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:05,478
And you know what?

475
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,783
I'm learning to control it.

476
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,421
I'm learning where it comes from.

477
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:17,250
For the first time in my life...

478
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:20,488
...I'm not afraid.

479
00:48:28,171 --> 00:48:31,402
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.

480
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,537
The Nanny Squad.

481
00:48:37,114 --> 00:48:39,412
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.

482
00:48:40,284 --> 00:48:43,048
Sir, may I go first?

483
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,915
Hang on a minute.

484
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,555
He barely knows him.

485
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:50,716
Then he should make it his business
to change that.

486
00:48:55,165 --> 00:48:56,632
Listen, H. B...

487
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,291
...I've got a chance out here.

488
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,232
So if you really care about me...

489
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:08,304
...you won't come back.

490
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:21,022
Yeah...

491
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:22,889
...I gotta go too.

492
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,825
Lots to do.

493
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,036
What took you so long?

494
00:49:39,910 --> 00:49:42,811
Come on, time to go home.

495
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,077
Tape you up.

496
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,044
What are you, a Boy Scout?

497
00:49:51,855 --> 00:49:55,086
- Nope, I never was.
- Well, you could have fooled me.

498
00:49:56,693 --> 00:49:58,058
Hey, Red.

499
00:49:58,462 --> 00:50:01,056
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.

500
00:50:01,231 --> 00:50:02,664
This is nothing.

501
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,427
You know what'll kill me, don't you?

502
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,871
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.

503
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:32,488
You were burned
by some organic acid.

504
00:50:32,662 --> 00:50:34,323
I'm lucky that way.

505
00:50:35,999 --> 00:50:38,695
- I worry about you.
- Me?

506
00:50:40,804 --> 00:50:42,533
Well...

507
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,198
...I won't be around forever,
you know.

508
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:47,468
Damn!

509
00:50:47,844 --> 00:50:50,836
Could you please be a little careful?

510
00:50:51,114 --> 00:50:52,342
Big baby.

511
00:50:52,949 --> 00:50:55,417
How long was it latched onto you?

512
00:50:55,786 --> 00:50:58,254
I don't know. About five seconds.

513
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,881
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?

514
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:07,686
Touched you five seconds,
laid three eggs.

515
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,866
Didn't even buy me a drink.

516
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,970
The stinger detaches itself from
the tongue and injects the eggs.

517
00:51:19,142 --> 00:51:23,010
They are very sensitive
to heat and light.

518
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:29,417
They need a humid,
dark environment to breed.

519
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,577
Did you ever lose track of him?

520
00:51:33,290 --> 00:51:34,780
Well, let's see.

521
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:38,917
There was that moment when
I had the train on top of my head.

522
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,757
We can't risk it.

523
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,230
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks
with a group of agents.

524
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:47,199
Search the whole place
top to bottom.

525
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,565
Find those eggs and destroy them.

526
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:02,543
"Elizabeth Sherman."

527
00:52:03,086 --> 00:52:05,816
I don't like the term "fire-starter."

528
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:07,078
I just don't.

529
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:11,627
And "pyrokinesis" sounds like
some psychosis or something.

530
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,023
I don't know.

531
00:52:13,697 --> 00:52:15,221
Maybe that's right.

532
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:17,764
Not being able to let go.

533
00:52:17,934 --> 00:52:19,231
It's scary.

534
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:24,364
I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.

535
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,339
You hear about so and so...

536
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,036
...who just lost control
and just exploded.

537
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:31,942
Well, they're lucky it isn't true.

538
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:34,341
With me, it is.

539
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:51,092
My master is calling
your name now, my girl.

540
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,599
You must return to the child.

541
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,897
So once again...

542
00:52:57,374 --> 00:52:59,535
...dream...

543
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,103
...of fire.

544
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,090
Hey, freak!

545
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,157
Get back here, freak!

546
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,857
- Let's get her!
- Get her!

547
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,332
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!

548
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:29,998
Freak!

549
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,202
Oh, no! Not again.

550
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:39,045
Oh, no! Somebody!

551
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,615
Help me!

552
00:53:40,817 --> 00:53:43,911
Help me, somebody! Help me!

553
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:33,234
How many buildings
does she have to burn down?

554
00:54:33,403 --> 00:54:35,234
She belongs here.

555
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,869
That's not what she feels.

556
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,943
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.

557
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:40,443
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.

558
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:41,945
Professor, the girl you're...

559
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:46,950
Professor,
that girl you're talking about...

560
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:47,951
Hey, Boy Scout...

561
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:48,451
Hey, Boy Scout...

562
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,619
...think twice.

563
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,710
No, listen, I read her file.

564
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:54,713
- "Read her file."
- She blames herself...

565
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:58,657
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.

566
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,260
I could talk to her.

567
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:03,262
I think I could bring her back.

568
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:07,033
Just what was it that landed you
this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?

569
00:55:07,404 --> 00:55:08,894
What was it?

570
00:55:09,072 --> 00:55:12,098
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?

571
00:55:12,275 --> 00:55:14,266
What is your area of expertise?

572
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,546
He doesn't want me with him.

573
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,042
I know that much.

574
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:22,480
- You're doing fine.
- No, I'm not.

575
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,882
Look, he respects Clay, not me.

576
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,419
I'm really sorry, okay?

577
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,959
I'm not your guy.

578
00:55:32,896 --> 00:55:35,797
I'm dying, Agent Myers.

579
00:55:37,167 --> 00:55:40,068
Like any father, I worry about him.

580
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:46,236
In medieval stories,
there is often a young knight...

581
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:49,970
...who is inexperienced...

582
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:53,675
...but pure of heart.
- Come on.

583
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,045
Look, I am not pure of heart.

584
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,777
Yes, you are.

585
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,350
Rasputin is back for him.

586
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,354
What I ask of you...

587
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:07,587
...is to have the courage
to stand by him when I am gone.

588
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:11,059
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.

589
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:13,259
But you will help him...

590
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:15,868
...in essence...

591
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,097
...to become a man.

592
00:56:33,590 --> 00:56:34,579
Pull that down.

593
00:56:34,758 --> 00:56:36,658
She was making great progress...

594
00:56:36,826 --> 00:56:37,986
...and now this.

595
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:40,152
We'll be closed for months.

596
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,662
And it put a big dent
in our Thorazine supply.

597
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:46,226
She's been like this
since it happened.

598
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:51,767
Are you sure you want to go in?

599
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:01,483
Miss Sherman?

600
00:57:01,651 --> 00:57:04,279
I'm Agent Myers, FBI.

601
00:57:07,757 --> 00:57:09,588
Miss Sherman?

602
00:57:11,528 --> 00:57:14,190
Can I call you Liz?

603
00:57:14,364 --> 00:57:16,798
It's a beautiful name.

604
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:20,595
Sixty percent of all the women
in the world are named Liz.

605
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:25,430
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.

606
00:57:25,809 --> 00:57:28,277
John T. Myers.

607
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:31,380
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you
back to the bureau.

608
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:35,177
No special precautions,
no security escorts.

609
00:57:35,351 --> 00:57:38,809
Just you and me in a taxi
like regular folks.

610
00:57:39,823 --> 00:57:41,620
That doesn't sound like him.

611
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:45,158
Well, Miss Sherman,
he's asking you back...

612
00:57:45,328 --> 00:57:47,523
...but it's entirely your choice,
you know?

613
00:57:47,864 --> 00:57:49,388
Choice, huh?

614
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,363
That's cute.

615
00:57:51,534 --> 00:57:54,867
I've quit the bureau 13 times.

616
00:57:55,038 --> 00:57:57,268
I always go back.

617
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,635
Where else would I go?

618
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:18,917
Over here.

619
00:58:20,396 --> 00:58:22,887
You said those eggs need it
dark and humid?

620
00:58:23,066 --> 00:58:25,000
Well, they hit the jackpot.

621
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:28,501
The subway lines,
they all converge right around here.

622
00:58:28,705 --> 00:58:31,105
Right below us
is the old Vandeveer reservoir.

623
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:33,071
It was abandoned in the mid-30s.

624
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:34,834
There's a pulse.

625
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:40,911
There. A cistern on the other side.

626
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:46,547
Most of the eggs are there.

627
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:49,021
There's no way in.

628
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,496
We should go back and request
a special permit, type 2...

629
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,445
You guys coming or what?

630
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:36,664
We lead a charmed life.

631
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:54,051
Here you are, doctor.

632
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:56,259
This should cover your tail fin.

633
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,261
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

634
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:58,761
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

635
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:01,764
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

636
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,265
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

637
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:03,766
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

638
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:04,767
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

639
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:07,270
Remind me why I keep doing this.

640
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:07,670
Remind me why I keep doing this.

641
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,332
Rotten eggs
and the safety of mankind.

642
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,613
This doesn't really look
like doll's hair.

643
01:00:57,787 --> 01:00:59,516
Be honest, Red. What do you think?

644
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,588
I'm thinking about doing it myself.

645
01:01:03,893 --> 01:01:05,485
Hey, you guys find anything?

646
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,651
No eggs yet, Red.

647
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,626
What, are you on a lunch break?

648
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,163
Nothing here.

649
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,806
Red's on the move. I'll cover him.

650
01:01:29,152 --> 01:01:30,585
Damn it, Red.

651
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:16,680
Hey, it's Abe.

652
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,390
Oh, God.

653
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,792
Bring your toy over here.

654
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,663
Oh, man.

655
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,806
Oh, Jesus.

656
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,538
There's only one. I'll fry him quick.

657
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:38,805
Two. There were two.

658
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,068
Red?

659
01:04:08,744 --> 01:04:10,041
Red. Come in, Red.

660
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,410
What's your 20? I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?

661
01:04:13,583 --> 01:04:15,915
It's like Swiss cheese in here.

662
01:04:16,586 --> 01:04:18,486
Sit tight, pal, I'm on him.

663
01:04:35,608 --> 01:04:38,441
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.

664
01:04:42,181 --> 01:04:44,081
Didn't I kill you already?

665
01:04:54,660 --> 01:04:57,288
You goddamn monster!

666
01:05:19,585 --> 01:05:20,609
Oh, crap.

667
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:37,366
It's for you!

668
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:40,335
You shouldn't hurt people!

669
01:06:01,260 --> 01:06:02,454
You missed.

670
01:06:22,215 --> 01:06:24,479
Hey, chunk-face.

671
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:29,644
You can do better than that,
big monster like you.

672
01:07:20,573 --> 01:07:22,675
My kittens! Please!

673
01:07:22,675 --> 01:07:23,176
My kittens! Please!

674
01:07:23,176 --> 01:07:25,178
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

675
01:07:25,178 --> 01:07:26,179
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

676
01:07:30,950 --> 01:07:32,383
Second date.

677
01:07:33,286 --> 01:07:34,753
No tongue.

678
01:07:47,433 --> 01:07:49,867
My kittens. Careful with them!

679
01:07:50,036 --> 01:07:52,027
Lady, give me a break!

680
01:08:12,558 --> 01:08:13,547
Thank you.

681
01:08:15,228 --> 01:08:16,252
My job.

682
01:09:08,781 --> 01:09:12,785
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.

683
01:09:12,785 --> 01:09:13,286
Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.

684
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:18,291
Buddy, don't take another step.

685
01:09:18,291 --> 01:09:18,791
Buddy, don't take another step.

686
01:09:44,116 --> 01:09:45,845
Clay.

687
01:10:19,985 --> 01:10:23,011
Man down. I need an ambulance
right away. Do you read me?

688
01:10:23,222 --> 01:10:24,849
Hang in there, pal.

689
01:10:25,257 --> 01:10:28,658
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?

690
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:33,394
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?

691
01:10:33,966 --> 01:10:36,958
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!

692
01:10:42,842 --> 01:10:46,869
Feels good to be outside.
It's been so long.

693
01:10:47,046 --> 01:10:49,606
You know that's...
That's not safe Miss Sherman.

694
01:10:49,782 --> 01:10:51,613
Please stay in the car.

695
01:10:55,888 --> 01:10:59,984
No, no. Miss Sherman. Please,
can you come down, Miss Sherman?

696
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:10,159
Nice view.

697
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:15,005
Hey, a smile, huh?
Yeah, that's good.

698
01:11:15,574 --> 01:11:17,235
Here.

699
01:11:18,744 --> 01:11:20,507
Damn.

700
01:11:21,347 --> 01:11:25,511
- You'll have to take another one later.
- Yeah.

701
01:11:49,241 --> 01:11:51,266
He'll make it.

702
01:11:53,312 --> 01:11:55,473
Not everyone was so lucky.

703
01:11:57,049 --> 01:11:59,415
We had two agents die today.

704
01:12:00,085 --> 01:12:02,519
Clay probably won't survive
the night.

705
01:12:02,688 --> 01:12:05,418
- Not now, Manning, please.
- My problem with you:

706
01:12:07,126 --> 01:12:08,593
You're reckless.

707
01:12:08,761 --> 01:12:12,094
These men trusted you
to lead them as a team.

708
01:12:12,264 --> 01:12:14,129
Where were you?

709
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,865
I knew those men
better than you did.

710
01:12:17,036 --> 01:12:20,733
- That makes it all right, then.
- No, it doesn't make it all right.

711
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:23,242
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

712
01:12:23,242 --> 01:12:23,976
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

713
01:12:23,976 --> 01:12:24,477
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

714
01:12:24,477 --> 01:12:25,978
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.

715
01:12:25,978 --> 01:12:26,479
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.

716
01:12:26,479 --> 01:12:29,482
You have an insight.
You know monsters.

717
01:12:30,983 --> 01:12:31,984
What are you trying to say?

718
01:12:31,984 --> 01:12:32,985
What are you trying to say?

719
01:12:33,986 --> 01:12:35,988
This whole thing is a farce.

720
01:12:35,988 --> 01:12:36,489
This whole thing is a farce.

721
01:12:36,989 --> 01:12:37,990
Because in the end...

722
01:12:38,491 --> 01:12:39,892
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

723
01:12:39,892 --> 01:12:41,826
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

724
01:12:42,761 --> 01:12:44,558
...there's still one left.

725
01:12:45,431 --> 01:12:46,921
You.

726
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:53,099
Hey, Manning.

727
01:12:53,272 --> 01:12:55,866
I wish I could be more gracious, but...

728
01:13:02,248 --> 01:13:04,648
Welcome back.

729
01:13:06,285 --> 01:13:08,913
It's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.

730
01:13:09,822 --> 01:13:12,290
Then I shall be on my way.

731
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:15,427
Oh, you should have a look around.

732
01:13:15,594 --> 01:13:17,960
We made some changes
around here.

733
01:13:25,304 --> 01:13:29,070
I want that thing locked up,
starting now.

734
01:13:29,241 --> 01:13:31,004
Right now! Do you...?

735
01:13:31,377 --> 01:13:33,277
Now, you hear me?

736
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:35,379
- Locked up!
- Nothing's changed.

737
01:13:35,581 --> 01:13:36,707
Home sweet home.

738
01:13:37,016 --> 01:13:38,244
Liz?

739
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:42,480
Liz!

740
01:13:44,523 --> 01:13:47,219
You did it, buddy. You did it!

741
01:13:50,796 --> 01:13:52,593
Myers?

742
01:13:53,132 --> 01:13:54,827
Pop?

743
01:14:02,741 --> 01:14:05,175
Hey, how you doing?

744
01:14:05,344 --> 01:14:07,335
Hey, what's that on your wrist?

745
01:14:08,447 --> 01:14:10,039
This?

746
01:14:10,215 --> 01:14:14,447
- It's something I learned in therapy.
- Yeah?

747
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:17,612
I'm depressed, one rubber band.

748
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:19,587
I'm impatient...

749
01:14:21,827 --> 01:14:23,658
...two rubber bands.

750
01:14:23,829 --> 01:14:25,694
Maybe...

751
01:14:27,900 --> 01:14:30,266
Maybe I should get you
a fresh pack.

752
01:14:32,571 --> 01:14:34,300
Yeah, maybe two.

753
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:36,808
Yeah, maybe.

754
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:47,283
I'm gonna put these over here, okay?

755
01:14:47,453 --> 01:14:48,715
One minute. One minute.

756
01:14:52,191 --> 01:14:53,749
Hey, Myers...

757
01:14:53,926 --> 01:14:56,053
...you're a talker.

758
01:14:56,295 --> 01:14:59,526
What's a good word,
a solid word, for "need"?

759
01:14:59,698 --> 01:15:00,858
Well...

760
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:03,024
..."need" is a good, solid word.

761
01:15:03,202 --> 01:15:04,430
Too needy.

762
01:15:04,603 --> 01:15:07,071
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.

763
01:15:08,907 --> 01:15:10,033
Nachos.

764
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:11,801
Oh, my God.

765
01:15:11,977 --> 01:15:13,808
Look at them all.

766
01:15:14,546 --> 01:15:16,673
Who had babies?

767
01:15:18,317 --> 01:15:23,277
Liz, there's something I need
for you to hear, and it's...

768
01:15:23,455 --> 01:15:25,946
Will it take long?
Because I'm actually going out.

769
01:15:27,726 --> 01:15:28,715
Out?

770
01:15:30,262 --> 01:15:31,251
"Out" out?

771
01:15:31,797 --> 01:15:35,790
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee,
but go ahead, read.

772
01:15:35,968 --> 01:15:37,458
Are you going alone?

773
01:15:38,971 --> 01:15:41,303
No, Myers is taking me.

774
01:15:42,307 --> 01:15:44,707
Hey, your chili's getting cold.

775
01:15:45,310 --> 01:15:46,334
Not hungry.

776
01:15:48,414 --> 01:15:50,473
Is there something
you'd like me to hear?

777
01:15:50,649 --> 01:15:53,345
- It's just a list. It's not finished.
- Okay.

778
01:15:53,519 --> 01:15:55,453
Well, then, later.

779
01:15:56,221 --> 01:15:57,950
See you.

780
01:15:59,258 --> 01:16:01,351
- Anything else you need?
- Not from you.

781
01:16:02,528 --> 01:16:03,517
Well, good night.

782
01:16:04,730 --> 01:16:05,890
Goodbye.

783
01:16:15,708 --> 01:16:18,871
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

784
01:16:19,211 --> 01:16:22,112
Born in Munich, 1897.

785
01:16:23,182 --> 01:16:26,083
Suffered from
a masochistic compulsion...

786
01:16:26,952 --> 01:16:30,285
...commonly known
as surgical addiction.

787
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:37,093
Both eyelids surgically removed...

788
01:16:40,365 --> 01:16:42,230
...along with his upper...

789
01:16:43,635 --> 01:16:45,227
...and lower lip.

790
01:16:47,039 --> 01:16:51,032
The blood in his veins
dried up decades ago.

791
01:16:52,811 --> 01:16:56,008
Only dust remains.

792
01:16:59,384 --> 01:17:02,410
What horrible will...

793
01:17:03,255 --> 01:17:06,315
...could keep such a creature
as this alive?

794
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:42,350
Oh, no.

795
01:17:44,163 --> 01:17:46,154
Come on, Red.

796
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:49,928
Jesus.

797
01:17:56,074 --> 01:17:59,339
Damn it, Red. Not again

798
01:18:01,013 --> 01:18:03,573
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?

799
01:18:03,749 --> 01:18:06,081
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?

800
01:18:23,836 --> 01:18:26,930
Do you want anything else?
The shop's closing.

801
01:18:27,105 --> 01:18:28,936
Here we go.

802
01:18:29,141 --> 01:18:30,870
Listen about...

803
01:18:31,243 --> 01:18:33,837
I admire him. He's a force of nature.

804
01:18:34,012 --> 01:18:36,606
What are you two talking about?

805
01:18:36,782 --> 01:18:40,081
What is so fascinating,
so important?

806
01:18:40,252 --> 01:18:42,618
No. He's determined, unstoppable.

807
01:18:42,788 --> 01:18:44,779
Some people would call that cocky.

808
01:18:44,957 --> 01:18:47,448
- He's just strong.
- Yeah. That he is.

809
01:18:47,626 --> 01:18:49,093
Hey, I've got yours.

810
01:18:49,862 --> 01:18:54,458
My uncle, he used to say
we like people for their qualities...

811
01:18:54,633 --> 01:18:56,828
...but love them for their defects.

812
01:18:58,871 --> 01:19:00,634
He loves you, you know.

813
01:19:02,908 --> 01:19:04,307
What about you?

814
01:19:05,978 --> 01:19:08,708
I don't know. I grew up with him.

815
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:13,518
But now every time I see him,
I get confused.

816
01:19:13,685 --> 01:19:16,654
There's hardly a day that goes by
that he's not in my mind.

817
01:19:16,822 --> 01:19:17,982
Even now...

818
01:19:19,124 --> 01:19:21,217
...I feel like he's here.

819
01:19:22,661 --> 01:19:24,219
Hey, wait up.

820
01:19:27,299 --> 01:19:29,699
You like doughnuts? I got two.

821
01:19:30,535 --> 01:19:33,333
- Thanks. That was nice.
- I got a cookie, as well.

822
01:19:33,505 --> 01:19:35,735
- Sugar?
- No. No sugar. Thank you.

823
01:19:35,908 --> 01:19:38,399
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.

824
01:19:38,844 --> 01:19:41,745
- I got some milk here.
- No. I'm okay. I don't take milk.

825
01:19:42,547 --> 01:19:43,775
Told you.

826
01:19:47,619 --> 01:19:49,109
She took his picture.

827
01:19:49,588 --> 01:19:50,748
Damn!

828
01:19:52,925 --> 01:19:54,756
She took his picture.

829
01:19:57,129 --> 01:19:58,790
She took his picture.

830
01:20:01,667 --> 01:20:03,157
She took his picture.

831
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:07,768
Oh, crap.

832
01:20:17,316 --> 01:20:18,840
It's freezing, isn't it?

833
01:20:19,484 --> 01:20:21,315
Coffee's warming me up.

834
01:20:22,621 --> 01:20:24,384
Well, what do we do now?

835
01:20:24,556 --> 01:20:27,957
Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.

836
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:31,458
- You sound like a game-show host.
- Hi.

837
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,297
Hey.

838
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:36,759
You're Hellboy.

839
01:20:40,505 --> 01:20:42,473
I'm on a mission.

840
01:20:45,377 --> 01:20:48,710
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?

841
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,246
I lived with my uncle most of my life.

842
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:55,011
Then I went to Quantico, went to top
of my class. I'm nothing like...

843
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:56,614
Don't tell anyone, huh?

844
01:21:00,392 --> 01:21:01,484
Attaboy.

845
01:21:09,901 --> 01:21:12,096
Sir, he left his locator.

846
01:21:12,270 --> 01:21:16,468
- Shall we send out some scouts?
- Enough, enough, enough.

847
01:21:18,243 --> 01:21:20,677
He'll never change.

848
01:21:20,979 --> 01:21:22,571
A child.

849
01:21:23,682 --> 01:21:26,116
Always a child.

850
01:21:40,732 --> 01:21:45,135
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

851
01:21:45,303 --> 01:21:47,032
Moscow.

852
01:21:47,205 --> 01:21:50,003
Who wants us in Moscow?

853
01:22:37,255 --> 01:22:39,917
- My mom baked them.
- She's laughing.

854
01:22:40,826 --> 01:22:43,522
She's sitting on a park bench,
and she's laughing.

855
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:46,621
That's it. I'm done.

856
01:22:47,032 --> 01:22:48,932
They don't look like spies.

857
01:22:49,801 --> 01:22:51,769
Are you kidding me?

858
01:22:52,104 --> 01:22:53,765
Look at this guy.

859
01:22:53,939 --> 01:22:57,636
Those shady little eyes,
that phony grin.

860
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:00,610
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.

861
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:05,408
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.

862
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:08,178
Yeah, the old yawning trick.

863
01:23:10,255 --> 01:23:11,847
Watch his arm.

864
01:23:18,563 --> 01:23:22,055
First he wants my job,
then he wants my girl.

865
01:23:25,737 --> 01:23:29,002
Hey, we all have a side
that we try to hide.

866
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,072
God...

867
01:23:37,349 --> 01:23:38,941
Hey, what the hell?

868
01:23:39,117 --> 01:23:42,314
Hey! Hey, who threw that?

869
01:23:45,257 --> 01:23:48,283
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

870
01:23:51,363 --> 01:23:52,887
Nice shot.

871
01:23:57,636 --> 01:24:01,663
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

872
01:24:02,374 --> 01:24:05,036
It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

873
01:24:12,317 --> 01:24:14,046
I see the puppet.

874
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:17,083
But where is...

875
01:24:18,056 --> 01:24:19,580
...the puppeteer?

876
01:24:19,758 --> 01:24:21,692
Very good, Professor Broom.

877
01:24:23,528 --> 01:24:24,995
It was you.

878
01:24:25,163 --> 01:24:27,631
The scraps of paper...

879
01:24:27,799 --> 01:24:30,597
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.

880
01:24:30,769 --> 01:24:32,669
Bread crumbs on the trail.

881
01:24:32,837 --> 01:24:34,668
Like in a fable.

882
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:37,065
They both distract him...

883
01:24:37,842 --> 01:24:39,969
...and guide him exactly
where I need him.

884
01:24:40,145 --> 01:24:41,305
Moscow.

885
01:24:41,479 --> 01:24:43,470
His destiny.

886
01:24:44,916 --> 01:24:46,213
And the last clue...

887
01:24:46,384 --> 01:24:49,512
...will be left by
the late Professor Broom.

888
01:24:49,688 --> 01:24:51,383
You raised the child.

889
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:53,421
Nurtured him.

890
01:24:53,592 --> 01:24:55,685
So in return...

891
01:24:56,127 --> 01:24:57,719
...I will permit you...

892
01:24:57,896 --> 01:25:02,560
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.

893
01:25:31,062 --> 01:25:33,223
He will open the portal...

894
01:25:33,398 --> 01:25:36,265
...and bring about
the end of the world.

895
01:25:40,572 --> 01:25:44,064
If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...

896
01:25:44,242 --> 01:25:46,403
...none of this would have
come to pass.

897
01:25:46,578 --> 01:25:49,945
But then,
how could you have known?

898
01:25:50,115 --> 01:25:53,175
Your God chooses to remain silent.

899
01:25:53,918 --> 01:25:56,216
Mine lives within me.

900
01:25:56,388 --> 01:25:58,982
Every time I died and crossed over...

901
01:25:59,924 --> 01:26:04,224
...a little more of the master...

902
01:26:04,396 --> 01:26:06,694
...came back with me.

903
01:26:07,365 --> 01:26:10,766
He disclosed to me
the child's true name.

904
01:26:11,603 --> 01:26:13,434
Would you like to know it?

905
01:26:13,605 --> 01:26:17,302
I know what to call him.

906
01:26:19,244 --> 01:26:23,010
Nothing you can do or say...

907
01:26:23,181 --> 01:26:25,411
...can change that.

908
01:26:26,318 --> 01:26:28,286
I call him...

909
01:26:30,588 --> 01:26:31,850
...Son.

910
01:26:37,429 --> 01:26:39,226
I'm ready.

911
01:26:41,366 --> 01:26:42,663
It'll be quick.

912
01:27:07,058 --> 01:27:10,391
Just go there
and tell her how you feel.

913
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:13,790
My mom says that...

914
01:27:13,965 --> 01:27:16,900
Look, it's not...
It's not that easy, okay?

915
01:27:19,637 --> 01:27:21,764
Plus, you're 9.

916
01:27:22,273 --> 01:27:24,867
You're not old enough
to be giving me advice.

917
01:27:26,845 --> 01:27:29,507
- All right, stand by.
- Who are those guys?

918
01:27:37,389 --> 01:27:41,086
Liz, I'm sorry. It's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.

919
01:27:41,259 --> 01:27:43,124
- No!
- Wait, what happened?

920
01:27:43,294 --> 01:27:44,625
- No!
- It's okay.

921
01:27:44,796 --> 01:27:46,161
No, not him.

922
01:27:46,331 --> 01:27:48,322
- Would you take her?
- Something's wrong.

923
01:29:37,208 --> 01:29:40,109
He hasn't spoken to anybody
in three days.

924
01:29:40,778 --> 01:29:42,439
Not a word.

925
01:29:42,747 --> 01:29:45,238
He won't eat, he won't sleep.

926
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:47,909
I've never seen him like this.

927
01:29:48,086 --> 01:29:49,075
Never.

928
01:29:49,754 --> 01:29:51,654
Should I stay?

929
01:29:52,257 --> 01:29:54,384
With him, I mean?

930
01:29:56,194 --> 01:30:00,426
Listen, I'm not much
of a problem solver.

931
01:30:01,666 --> 01:30:06,228
Three decades,
I've only completed two sides.

932
01:30:06,404 --> 01:30:07,837
But I do know this much.

933
01:30:08,006 --> 01:30:10,236
If there's trouble...

934
01:30:10,408 --> 01:30:14,344
...all us freaks have is each other.

935
01:30:15,613 --> 01:30:17,171
And I'm stuck here.

936
01:30:17,348 --> 01:30:18,975
So...

937
01:30:19,150 --> 01:30:22,551
...take care of the big monkey for me,
will you?

938
01:31:04,996 --> 01:31:08,989
I have accumulated many objects
of great interest...

939
01:31:09,167 --> 01:31:12,102
...preserving our heritage.

940
01:31:14,472 --> 01:31:17,566
Many, like me,
believe Mother Russia...

941
01:31:17,742 --> 01:31:22,202
...to be very close
to a historic rebirth.

942
01:31:23,348 --> 01:31:24,975
"Rebirth"?

943
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:28,075
I like that.

944
01:31:34,392 --> 01:31:37,122
Twenty tons of stone.

945
01:31:37,295 --> 01:31:40,230
This thing fell from the sky
into Tunguska Forest.

946
01:31:40,398 --> 01:31:42,389
June 30th, 1908.

947
01:31:42,567 --> 01:31:45,730
The Romanovs took possession
of it immediately.

948
01:31:45,903 --> 01:31:47,996
I've wanted it for ages.

949
01:31:48,172 --> 01:31:49,537
You're aware, of course...

950
01:31:49,707 --> 01:31:53,438
...there's no way you'll get it out
of Russian territory.

951
01:31:53,611 --> 01:31:58,048
He is aware.
Our guests are coming in.

952
01:31:58,383 --> 01:32:02,410
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.

953
01:32:02,587 --> 01:32:06,956
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
That's the only clue we have.

954
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:09,821
We've collected
and destroyed thousands of eggs...

955
01:32:09,994 --> 01:32:13,953
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.

956
01:32:14,132 --> 01:32:17,659
We leave as soon
as we get clearance and equipment.

957
01:32:17,835 --> 01:32:19,496
Hellboy's coming.

958
01:32:20,004 --> 01:32:23,030
I'm not pleased about that,
but I'll be in charge this time.

959
01:32:23,207 --> 01:32:27,701
We either wrap this up or I'm closing
this freak show for good.

960
01:32:37,922 --> 01:32:39,219
Hi.

961
01:32:39,557 --> 01:32:40,615
Hi.

962
01:32:45,463 --> 01:32:47,124
I'II...

963
01:32:47,432 --> 01:32:49,229
...come to Moscow...

964
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,732
...if you're still going.

965
01:32:52,203 --> 01:32:53,363
I am.

966
01:32:53,871 --> 01:32:56,271
But I have something to say.

967
01:32:58,743 --> 01:33:01,143
I understand
what you don't like about me.

968
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,574
I do.

969
01:33:03,915 --> 01:33:05,405
What I am...

970
01:33:06,984 --> 01:33:09,544
...makes you feel
a little out of place...

971
01:33:10,021 --> 01:33:11,010
...out there.

972
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:12,679
- Red, I don't...
- Listen.

973
01:33:15,293 --> 01:33:16,726
I'm not like Myers.

974
01:33:17,962 --> 01:33:20,362
He makes you feel like you belong...

975
01:33:21,099 --> 01:33:22,726
...which is good, really.

976
01:33:29,607 --> 01:33:32,201
I wish I could do something about this.

977
01:33:34,212 --> 01:33:36,077
I can't.

978
01:33:38,216 --> 01:33:40,582
I can promise you two things:

979
01:33:41,719 --> 01:33:44,210
One, I'll always look this good.

980
01:33:49,093 --> 01:33:51,220
And two...

981
01:33:52,730 --> 01:33:54,630
...I'll never give up on you.

982
01:33:57,435 --> 01:33:58,561
Ever.

983
01:34:00,705 --> 01:34:02,263
I like that.

984
01:34:16,821 --> 01:34:20,416
This engraving here
represents Sammy. Text reads:

985
01:34:20,591 --> 01:34:25,119
"One falls, two shall arise. Sammael."

986
01:34:26,998 --> 01:34:29,626
We'll have to nail them all at once,
and the eggs.

987
01:34:29,801 --> 01:34:31,826
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.

988
01:34:33,204 --> 01:34:36,037
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.

989
01:34:36,207 --> 01:34:39,574
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.

990
01:34:39,744 --> 01:34:41,644
Cable pulls the safety pins.

991
01:34:41,979 --> 01:34:42,968
Kaboom.

992
01:34:43,147 --> 01:34:45,240
Easy to clean, easy to use.

993
01:34:52,023 --> 01:34:55,254
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.

994
01:34:58,095 --> 01:34:59,392
"Sparky"?

995
01:34:59,564 --> 01:35:01,862
Who came up with that? Myers?

996
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:05,192
Yeah, we're leaving the main road,
so hang on.

997
01:35:05,369 --> 01:35:07,394
This better be the place or I'll puke.

998
01:35:14,679 --> 01:35:16,271
You better come out and see.

999
01:35:28,926 --> 01:35:32,362
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

1000
01:35:42,073 --> 01:35:46,237
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.

1001
01:35:46,410 --> 01:35:48,844
It's practically a city.

1002
01:35:49,013 --> 01:35:51,311
And it stinks, and it's muddy.

1003
01:35:51,482 --> 01:35:56,476
I think we go back, we check
into the hotel, we regroup.

1004
01:35:56,654 --> 01:35:58,485
After breakfast.

1005
01:35:58,656 --> 01:36:02,114
I think what we have to do here
is we have to make a grid.

1006
01:36:02,293 --> 01:36:07,390
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.

1007
01:36:10,735 --> 01:36:12,794
Let me ask for directions.

1008
01:36:15,006 --> 01:36:16,997
Where are you going?

1009
01:36:27,385 --> 01:36:30,786
Come on, baby, find me a talker.

1010
01:36:49,407 --> 01:36:50,567
Hi there.

1011
01:37:11,195 --> 01:37:12,457
Come on.

1012
01:37:13,597 --> 01:37:14,689
Come on.

1013
01:37:15,599 --> 01:37:16,827
Come on.

1014
01:37:20,438 --> 01:37:22,133
What do you want?

1015
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:24,837
This is ridiculous.

1016
01:37:26,978 --> 01:37:28,502
I run this show, not him.

1017
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:30,408
This guy's nothing but trouble.

1018
01:37:32,717 --> 01:37:35,185
- Ten minutes, we're out of here.
- Will you shut up...

1019
01:37:35,353 --> 01:37:37,321
...and let him do his thing?

1020
01:37:37,488 --> 01:37:39,388
Anybody got a PowerBar?

1021
01:37:42,259 --> 01:37:44,659
Hey, there he is.

1022
01:37:46,630 --> 01:37:49,030
Sixty feet further, comrades.

1023
01:37:49,967 --> 01:37:51,559
And three rows in.

1024
01:37:52,303 --> 01:37:54,464
What the hell is that on his back?

1025
01:37:55,206 --> 01:37:57,936
This here is Ivan Klimentovich.

1026
01:37:58,142 --> 01:37:59,803
Say "hi," Ivan.

1027
01:38:00,077 --> 01:38:02,511
Go that way, Red Monkey!

1028
01:38:02,713 --> 01:38:03,702
Gotcha.

1029
01:38:16,160 --> 01:38:18,993
Ivan says there's a whole network
of tunnels down here.

1030
01:38:19,163 --> 01:38:20,494
Goes on for miles.

1031
01:38:25,569 --> 01:38:28,094
Stay close, everybody.

1032
01:38:28,672 --> 01:38:30,333
You better be right about this.

1033
01:38:39,083 --> 01:38:41,574
We'll be all right as long as
we don't separate.

1034
01:38:59,637 --> 01:39:01,628
Hey, Sparky.

1035
01:39:01,806 --> 01:39:05,435
Tell everyone to turn their locator
belts on. Anybody sees anything...

1036
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:06,803
I'll say "Marco."

1037
01:39:06,977 --> 01:39:08,001
Polo.

1038
01:39:08,446 --> 01:39:11,779
- Are you sure about this?
- On a scale of one to ten: Two.

1039
01:39:12,349 --> 01:39:15,512
Don't worry, Boy Scout,
she'll take care of you.

1040
01:39:15,686 --> 01:39:17,347
She's a tough one.

1041
01:39:21,025 --> 01:39:22,083
Come on.

1042
01:39:32,970 --> 01:39:35,700
Ask your buddy
how far this thing goes.

1043
01:39:51,622 --> 01:39:53,522
How you doing up there, Ivan?

1044
01:39:53,924 --> 01:39:57,291
If I had legs I'd kick your ass!

1045
01:39:58,028 --> 01:40:01,054
Would you mind holding this guy
for a while? He is so negative.

1046
01:40:16,347 --> 01:40:17,678
What the hell is that?

1047
01:40:26,157 --> 01:40:27,681
Something big.

1048
01:40:27,858 --> 01:40:29,587
- Lime, come with me.
- Right.

1049
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:33,025
No, no, no. Stay put!

1050
01:40:35,566 --> 01:40:37,227
Stop!

1051
01:40:37,902 --> 01:40:39,699
You listen to me.

1052
01:40:39,870 --> 01:40:40,928
Listen to me!

1053
01:40:42,006 --> 01:40:43,030
I'm in charge.

1054
01:40:43,207 --> 01:40:46,108
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.

1055
01:40:46,277 --> 01:40:49,906
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!

1056
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:51,411
Lime, let's go!

1057
01:40:51,582 --> 01:40:54,244
Stay put!

1058
01:40:55,519 --> 01:40:59,888
And you! I am not afraid of you!

1059
01:41:00,057 --> 01:41:02,821
I'm in charge! We go back!

1060
01:41:06,030 --> 01:41:10,797
I was better off dead!

1061
01:41:35,292 --> 01:41:36,452
Oh, crap.

1062
01:42:10,661 --> 01:42:12,492
Music.

1063
01:42:55,339 --> 01:42:56,363
Really went deep.

1064
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,609
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

1065
01:43:28,238 --> 01:43:30,103
You killed my father.

1066
01:43:30,274 --> 01:43:31,502
Your ass is mine.

1067
01:43:43,620 --> 01:43:46,088
What are you laughing at,
you Nazi son of a...?

1068
01:44:12,015 --> 01:44:13,846
Don't even think about it.

1069
01:44:34,972 --> 01:44:37,770
That's all for you, pinhead.

1070
01:44:47,151 --> 01:44:48,778
What are you doing?

1071
01:44:48,952 --> 01:44:50,510
- What are you doing?
- Having a...

1072
01:44:50,687 --> 01:44:52,416
You never light a cigar that way.

1073
01:44:52,589 --> 01:44:54,056
You use a wooden match.

1074
01:44:56,427 --> 01:44:58,725
Preserves the flavor. You see?

1075
01:45:07,938 --> 01:45:09,496
Thank you.

1076
01:45:09,673 --> 01:45:11,231
Thank you.

1077
01:45:17,781 --> 01:45:20,807
So he thinks you and I...

1078
01:45:22,252 --> 01:45:24,015
That's why he's mad at me.

1079
01:45:29,226 --> 01:45:32,354
But it's not true, right?

1080
01:45:34,164 --> 01:45:35,188
What?

1081
01:45:35,365 --> 01:45:38,596
Well, that, you know,
you feel that way about me.

1082
01:45:38,969 --> 01:45:42,200
You want to know that here? Now?

1083
01:45:46,910 --> 01:45:48,002
Yeah.

1084
01:45:50,113 --> 01:45:53,207
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.

1085
01:45:56,186 --> 01:45:57,210
Hey, wait up.

1086
01:45:58,388 --> 01:46:00,151
Have you found them yet?

1087
01:46:00,324 --> 01:46:03,293
I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.

1088
01:46:03,460 --> 01:46:05,087
Okay, good.

1089
01:46:06,797 --> 01:46:11,325
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.

1090
01:46:12,102 --> 01:46:14,171
Liz, wait.

1091
01:46:17,174 --> 01:46:19,176
Oh, my God.

1092
01:46:20,177 --> 01:46:22,679
Let's back out real slow.

1093
01:46:22,679 --> 01:46:23,180
Let's back out real slow.

1094
01:46:40,564 --> 01:46:42,930
Myers, ready your grenades.

1095
01:46:44,501 --> 01:46:47,163
Marco. Marco. Marco.

1096
01:46:47,337 --> 01:46:49,999
Get your big, red butt over here.

1097
01:46:56,280 --> 01:46:57,542
I'm coming for you, kid!

1098
01:47:56,573 --> 01:47:58,768
No piggybacks!

1099
01:48:03,714 --> 01:48:05,545
Get off me, you...

1100
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:10,143
Liz, no!

1101
01:48:10,320 --> 01:48:13,153
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!

1102
01:48:13,323 --> 01:48:14,756
What do you want me to do?

1103
01:48:14,925 --> 01:48:15,949
- Hit me.
- What?

1104
01:48:16,760 --> 01:48:18,125
Hit me.

1105
01:48:20,030 --> 01:48:21,019
Now!

1106
01:48:30,807 --> 01:48:33,037
You should be running.

1107
01:49:43,146 --> 01:49:45,011
They are all here.

1108
01:49:45,449 --> 01:49:46,973
All of them.

1109
01:49:47,484 --> 01:49:50,282
Just the way it was promised.

1110
01:49:53,990 --> 01:49:55,457
This one's awake.

1111
01:50:00,430 --> 01:50:02,921
Thank you for this.

1112
01:50:40,437 --> 01:50:42,029
"And I looked...

1113
01:50:43,273 --> 01:50:44,775
...and beheld an angel.

1114
01:50:46,276 --> 01:50:50,781
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit."

1115
01:50:50,781 --> 01:50:51,281
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit."

1116
01:50:53,784 --> 01:50:58,789
These were the words I heard
as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.

1117
01:50:58,789 --> 01:51:01,124
And now, the door.

1118
01:51:01,591 --> 01:51:03,821
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...

1119
01:51:04,427 --> 01:51:09,694
...so that they might at long last
enter our world.

1120
01:51:09,866 --> 01:51:13,859
You are the key,
the right hand of doom.

1121
01:51:14,838 --> 01:51:16,499
Your stone hand.

1122
01:51:16,673 --> 01:51:19,039
What did you think it was made for?

1123
01:51:21,044 --> 01:51:22,443
Open the locks.

1124
01:51:22,612 --> 01:51:24,239
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!

1125
01:51:27,083 --> 01:51:28,345
Silence.

1126
01:51:31,054 --> 01:51:33,579
Imagine it.

1127
01:51:33,757 --> 01:51:35,850
An Eden...

1128
01:51:36,026 --> 01:51:37,550
...for you and her.

1129
01:51:37,761 --> 01:51:39,329
No.

1130
01:51:39,830 --> 01:51:41,331
No?

1131
01:51:43,333 --> 01:51:45,335
In exchange for her soul, then?

1132
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:52,968
Open the door.

1133
01:51:54,644 --> 01:51:56,236
No.

1134
01:51:57,047 --> 01:51:59,379
As you wish.

1135
01:52:00,884 --> 01:52:02,784
No!

1136
01:52:22,005 --> 01:52:23,302
Liz!

1137
01:52:32,082 --> 01:52:35,074
Her soul awaits on the other side.

1138
01:52:35,418 --> 01:52:37,386
If you want her back...

1139
01:52:37,554 --> 01:52:40,182
...open the door and claim her.

1140
01:52:44,327 --> 01:52:48,957
Your true name is inscribed
around the locks that hold you.

1141
01:52:49,132 --> 01:52:50,622
You cannot break them...

1142
01:52:50,800 --> 01:52:53,325
...no matter how strong you are.

1143
01:52:53,503 --> 01:52:55,494
The eclipse has begun.

1144
01:52:58,742 --> 01:53:00,573
Your true name...

1145
01:53:01,678 --> 01:53:03,339
...say it!

1146
01:53:10,320 --> 01:53:11,378
Become the key.

1147
01:53:20,497 --> 01:53:22,488
For her.

1148
01:53:23,900 --> 01:53:26,835
Anung un Rama.

1149
01:53:27,003 --> 01:53:28,630
Repeat it.

1150
01:53:28,805 --> 01:53:31,365
Anung un Rama.

1151
01:55:56,753 --> 01:55:59,017
Open the final lock.

1152
01:55:59,722 --> 01:56:02,418
Remember who you are!

1153
01:56:22,745 --> 01:56:25,908
Believe me, I have lived
long enough to know...

1154
01:56:26,082 --> 01:56:28,516
...not a tear will be shed
for this world!

1155
01:56:28,685 --> 01:56:30,209
You have a choice.

1156
01:56:30,386 --> 01:56:32,911
Your father gave you that.

1157
01:56:33,089 --> 01:56:34,420
No, you don't!

1158
01:56:34,591 --> 01:56:35,922
Open it!

1159
01:56:38,595 --> 01:56:40,187
Do it!

1160
01:57:04,354 --> 01:57:06,083
What have you done?

1161
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,851
I chose.

1162
01:57:22,972 --> 01:57:25,600
You will never fulfill your destiny.

1163
01:57:25,775 --> 01:57:29,734
You will never understand
the power inside you.

1164
01:57:29,913 --> 01:57:32,814
I'll just have to find a way
to live with that.

1165
01:57:44,394 --> 01:57:45,861
Child.

1166
01:57:46,029 --> 01:57:47,621
Look what you've done.

1167
01:57:48,398 --> 01:57:50,593
You've killed me...

1168
01:57:51,234 --> 01:57:53,099
...an insignificant man.

1169
01:57:53,269 --> 01:57:55,430
But you have brought forth...

1170
01:57:56,372 --> 01:57:58,306
...a god.

1171
01:58:06,616 --> 01:58:08,675
Myers, let's go.

1172
01:58:27,403 --> 01:58:30,304
Hell will hold no surprises for us.

1173
01:58:44,053 --> 01:58:46,044
I took a grenade belt.

1174
01:58:47,824 --> 01:58:49,951
The damn thing's broken.

1175
01:58:54,831 --> 01:58:56,992
Keep her safe, will you?

1176
01:58:57,166 --> 01:58:59,657
Whatever happens,
don't leave her alone.

1177
01:59:00,303 --> 01:59:01,361
I won't.

1178
01:59:09,412 --> 01:59:11,209
You're okay, Myers.

1179
01:59:12,115 --> 01:59:13,582
Stick around.

1180
01:59:14,217 --> 01:59:15,980
Hey, Red.

1181
01:59:19,389 --> 01:59:20,822
Just pull the cable.

1182
01:59:20,990 --> 01:59:22,389
I didn't get you anything.

1183
01:59:24,327 --> 01:59:27,490
Are you going to be okay alone?

1184
01:59:30,566 --> 01:59:32,227
How big can it be?

1185
01:59:40,009 --> 01:59:41,169
Damn!

1186
01:59:58,761 --> 01:59:59,853
Damn.

1187
02:00:49,178 --> 02:00:50,770
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

1188
02:01:20,543 --> 02:01:22,670
Gonna be sore in the morning.

1189
02:01:42,498 --> 02:01:44,227
She's got no pulse.

1190
02:01:45,368 --> 02:01:47,029
She's not breathing.

1191
02:01:57,980 --> 02:01:59,379
Liz?

1192
02:01:59,715 --> 02:02:02,013
I was so foolish.

1193
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:35,347
Red.

1194
02:02:42,625 --> 02:02:44,286
In the dark...

1195
02:02:47,864 --> 02:02:49,923
...I heard your voice.

1196
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:56,533
What did you say?

1197
02:02:58,641 --> 02:03:00,199
I said, "Hey...

1198
02:03:01,110 --> 02:03:03,340
...you on the other side...

1199
02:03:05,181 --> 02:03:06,842
...let her go.

1200
02:03:08,684 --> 02:03:10,208
Because for...

1201
02:03:17,159 --> 02:03:19,491
For her I'll cross over.

1202
02:03:22,899 --> 02:03:25,561
And then you'll be sorry."

1203
02:03:46,055 --> 02:03:48,649
What makes a man a man?

1204
02:03:48,958 --> 02:03:51,620
A friend of mine once wondered.

1205
02:03:52,261 --> 02:03:56,322
Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?

1206
02:03:56,799 --> 02:03:58,630
I don't think so.

1207
02:03:58,801 --> 02:04:00,735
It's the choices he makes.

1208
02:04:00,903 --> 02:04:03,201
Not how he starts things...

1209
02:04:03,372 --> 02:04:06,500
...but how he decides to end them.

1210
02:06:14,403 --> 02:06:17,497
Hey, guys? I'm still here.

1211
02:06:20,643 --> 02:06:21,974
Hello?

1212
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:25,140
