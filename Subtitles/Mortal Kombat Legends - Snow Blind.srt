the Black Dragon are here

Once upon a time, before the Wasteland,
before the revenants,

47

you all lived together in small boxes,

48

fat, bored, and lacking purpose.

49
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:51,148
Then, the wars came,

50
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,902
and you ran off into
your little corners of the world.

51
00:03:54,985 --> 00:03:58,614
But the revenants kept coming.

52
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:01,200
And now, your resources are scarce.

53

Your pathetic lives will have meaning.

57
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,675
It's time to take back
the Wasteland once and for all.

Maybe he was nuts.

You'd be wise to remember that.

[Kabal grunting]

171
00:11:40,117 --> 00:11:42,286
You just made a big mistake.

172
00:11:42,828 --> 00:11:44,204
Won't be my last.

173
00:11:44,288 --> 00:11:45,581
I wouldn't count on that.

174
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:59,595
Do you know what you've done?

175
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,055
Listen, I didn't do it to help you.

176
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:04,683
I was hoping this town might
give me a challenger worth fighting.

177
00:12:04,766 --> 00:12:07,060
No. Don't you know who they were?

178
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:09,563
Those are members of the Black Dragon.

179
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,149
The most deadly scourge
on the Wasteland.

180
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,484
After what you did,
they're going to come back,

181
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,737
and this time, none of us will be safe.

182
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:20,115
Come back? Hmm.

183
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,701
Maybe I'll stick around after all.

Stop fucking around.

No, she's hurt. I'm not going to kill...

Thank you, King Kano.

[crowd cheering]

00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:27,265
Aw, she's dead.

202
00:13:28,016 --> 00:13:28,892
Well, that was fun.

203
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,228
[cheering and laughing]

204
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,655
Oh, the children have returned.

205
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,408
Where have you little bastards been?

206
00:13:44,825 --> 00:13:46,660
We found another outpost.

207
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,954
It was well defended.

208
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,039
[Kira] We'll go back and take them.

209
00:13:51,123 --> 00:13:53,083
Kill every last one. Just let us...

210
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:54,001
[Kano] Quiet!

211
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:56,336
Tremor.

212
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,557
Why don't you go back with these three?

213
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:13,020
See who could
possibly reduce my elite guard

214
00:14:13,103 --> 00:14:14,521
to a puddle of weakness.

215
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,773
[Tremor] Yes, King Kano.

216
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:17,691
Shang Tsung?

217
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:21,820
Now, where have you gone?

218
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,379
[energy pulsating]

219
00:14:46,887 --> 00:14:47,721
[Kano] Boo!

00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:48,805
[laughing]

221
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,936
[hesitates] Sire, I was just
leaving your decanter.

222
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,522
I know you like to have it full.

223
00:14:57,606 --> 00:15:00,150
Yes. Yes, I do.

224
00:15:03,904 --> 00:15:05,697
Ah. [burps]

225
00:15:06,448 --> 00:15:07,908
Oh, pardon me.

226
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,412
If that is all...

227
00:15:12,496 --> 00:15:15,248
[Kano burps] I need you
to do something for me.

228
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:17,542
- Anything.
- Follow Tremor.

229
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,880
He's going to a small city
hidden between the dunes.

230
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,884
Sire, there's much to do here. I...

231
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,386
Will do what your king asks.

232
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:31,348
Yes? Yes.

233
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,937
He and the others have been planning
to defect for some time now.

234
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:42,567
And you know how I feel
about those usurping my power?

235
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:45,278
Yes, Your Majesty.

236
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:48,865
Yes. Go.

237
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,952
Report back to me
the truth of what you see.

238
00:15:52,828 --> 00:15:54,204
As you wish.

239
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,084
Not long now.

240
00:16:01,419 --> 00:16:02,629

[pigs grunting]

00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:58,852
Kuai, I didn't see you yesterday.

249
00:17:00,312 --> 00:17:02,522
I was held up.

250
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,359
Widow Reynolds
has been asking about you again.

251
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,903
I told her you were a eunuch.

252
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,821
I'm afraid that might not dissuade her.

253

- [women laughing]

00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,011
It can't be.

257
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:39,726
Hey, old man,
quite a crop you have there.

258
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:42,437
I've been all over the Wasteland,

259
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,689
and I've never seen
this much fruit in one place.

260
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:49,319
You need a lot of water
for something like this, or...

261
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,448
Maybe the Lin Kuei taught you
more than fighting, huh?

262
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,372
I saw your tattoo.
Is it true what they say?

263
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:04,084
That the Lin Kuei were
the deadliest warriors to ever live?

264
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,003
Never heard of them. Sorry.

265
00:18:08,546 --> 00:18:10,090
Is this kid bothering you?

266
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:14,427
No. No, no, no. My mistake.
I thought he was someone else.

267
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,645
[exhales]

268
00:18:26,106 --> 00:18:28,066
[chuckles] Never heard of them, huh?

269
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,151
Kuai, do you need me to...

270
00:18:33,446 --> 00:18:34,572
What do you want?

271
00:18:35,365 --> 00:18:36,241
What do I want?

272
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:41,788
I, Kenshi Takahashi, want to be
the greatest fighter to ever exist.

273
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:45,583
So, I want you to teach me
everything that you know.

274
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:49,212
I know anyone looking
to prove themselves as great

275
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:52,173
- knows only one thing.
- Yeah, what's that?

276
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:54,551
They know nothing.

277
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,472
Listen, old man, I can pay you.

278
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,142
I've made a fortune fighting
in different towns, and...

279
00:19:02,225 --> 00:19:03,643
I don't want your money.

280
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,731
I just want to be left alone in peace.

281
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,648
[Kabal] Peace?

282
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,362
The only way there will be peace
is if King Kano rules the land.

283
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,823
Oh, look,

284
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,867
you brought some more friends
I can humiliate.

285
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,161
[Tremor] You know,

286
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:23,955
King Kano is always looking
for capable warriors

287
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,457
to join the Black Dragon.

288
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,461
What do you think?
Want to run with the big dogs?

289
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,713
More like small pups.

290
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:33,965
[Tremor] There's always
the other option.

291
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:36,509
To go back
to the conversation I was having?

292
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:39,512
To apologize and kneel.

293
00:19:44,392 --> 00:19:46,644
Get out of here!
We don't want your kind...

294
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:47,562
[grunts]

295
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:56,571
[Kenshi] The Black Dragon
are thugs and cowards.

296
00:19:56,988 --> 00:19:59,741
If you want Kenshi Takahashi
to apologize,

297
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:01,159
you'll have to make me.

298
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,912
[whispers] Takahashi?

299
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:08,583
Not here.

300
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,794
Get out of the way, old timer.

301
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:12,962
This is not the place for fighting.

302
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:15,715
Every place is a place for fighting.

303
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,134
I'll tell you what. We'll leave.

304
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:21,513
Right after someone kneels before me.

305

Here, Kuai. Let me help.

[Kuai Liang grunts]

313
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:49,499
You like picking on old men?
How about you pick on me?

314
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,584
Don't mind if I do.

[Kabal] That'll teach him.

333
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,568
I believe you owe me an apology.

334
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,656
Hmm. Have it your way.

[grunts]

337
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,512
Let that be a lesson.

338
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,141
No one stands a chance
against King Kano and the Black Dragon.

339
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:31,809
Be ready,

340
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:36,689
for the king will arrive soon,
and you'll all bow before him.

341
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:38,483
And if not,

342
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:42,028
what happened to this fool
will happen to you.

343
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:45,823
[Kira] Tremor, Tremor,

344
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:49,202
Tremor! [laughs]

345
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:54,999
[Kenshi groans in pain]

346
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,754
[breathing heavily]

[panting]

349
00:23:15,061 --> 00:23:17,105
Please, let me help you.

350
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:20,775
Thank... Thank you.

351
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,571
Song. My name is Song.

352
00:23:25,405 --> 00:23:26,406
[grunts]

353
00:23:26,489 --> 00:23:29,617
Thank you for your help, Song. [groans]

354
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:32,620
- [groaning]
- There. Sit.

355
00:23:33,454 --> 00:23:34,289
[groans]

356
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:36,583
[panting]

357
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,504
You know, I have been
in your position before.

358
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,382
You are a fine warrior.

359
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:49,846
But against those with power,
no one stands a chance.

360
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:51,681
Unless...

361
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:53,725
Unless what?

362
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,269
It is too dangerous.

363
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,979
- Forget I said...
- Please, what?

364
00:23:59,439 --> 00:24:00,690
There is a sword.

365
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,735
It's said to have amazing powers.

366
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:06,988
More power than the man you fought.

367
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,742
More power than King Kano.

368
00:24:12,035 --> 00:24:12,869
Take me.

369
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,705
If... If men exist with such abilities,

370
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:18,541
I could never be the champion
I was destined to be.

371
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:20,418
And if you know of such a weapon...

372
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,295
A sword.

373
00:24:23,254 --> 00:24:25,048
Yes. A sword.

374
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,883
Please. Help me.

375
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:30,178
Of course I will help you.

376
00:24:30,595 --> 00:24:31,554
Come.

377
00:24:31,638 --> 00:24:33,681
I will find us supplies.

378
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,685
And then, you will have your power.

379
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,272
And your revenge.

380
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:03,670
There.

381
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:18,976
[grunts]

382
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:41,874
These... These markings...

383
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:43,584
This language...

384
00:25:44,961 --> 00:25:46,337
I can... I can read this.

385
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:52,677
"Here in the well of... of souls,

386
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:58,224
the power of the Takahashi dwells."

387
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,935
This... This was made by my ancestors.

388
00:26:01,436 --> 00:26:03,438
It must be destiny.

389
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,233
[grunting]

390
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:09,068
Damn it! It's not opening.

Blood magic.

392
00:26:11,612 --> 00:26:13,072
- Here.

393
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,365
What are you doing?

394
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,242
Place your hand on the seal.

395
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:31,883
What do you see?

396
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:36,179
[sighs] Nothing. It's empty.

397
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,556
No, no, no. Wait.

398
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:39,891
There's a light.

399
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:42,185
It's... It's getting brighter.

400
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:43,686
Yes.

401

[screams and grunts]

Yes, at last.

[grunts] Song. Song!

405

Song.

[chuckles maliciously]

00:27:03,581 --> 00:27:04,582
No.

409
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,375
My name

410
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:09,003
is Shang Tsung.

411
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,006
[grunts] Shang Tsung.

412
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:13,925
[grunts] I know that name.

413
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:18,596
I was once the most
powerful force in the realms.

414
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:20,807
Before Kano.

415
00:27:21,349 --> 00:27:24,185
But now, with these souls,

416
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:27,647
I will reclaim my rightful place.

417
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:33,903
Your souls are mine.

00:27:39,408 --> 00:27:40,243
Yes!

420
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:42,203
The power.

421
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,039
[Shang] The power!

[exhales]

424
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:06,185
Now Kano will see
what it's like to be a slave.

425
00:28:08,145 --> 00:28:09,647
They all will.

426
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,861
And you, Kenshi.

427
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,655
What shall I do with you?

428
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:20,408
[breathes shakily] Just... kill me.

What... What are you?

Sento.

[Kenshi groans softly]

439
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:02,825
[Sento] I am yours.

00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:08,539
Wield me and see.

441
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,004
Impossible.

You know, I'd been wondering
where you got off to,

Shang Tsung.

484
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,241
I went off

485
00:32:30,324 --> 00:32:34,578
to find a way
to put you back in your place.

Oh.

Come now.

00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,838
Why do you think
I sent you to the outpost?

491
00:32:44,338 --> 00:32:46,006
We've done this dance before.

492
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:47,758
But I thought this time,

493
00:32:47,842 --> 00:32:51,637
this time you might give me
just a little bit of a challenge.

You had no right to rule.

Huh. Not bad.

504

I swear, each time you're
getting a little bit better at this.

Ahhh!

509
00:33:42,605 --> 00:33:46,275
Oh! Eee, ooh, ah, ah, oh, ah!

510
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:49,570
[laughing]

511
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,323
Impossible. Your soul...

512
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,449
Ah, mate.

513
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,036
I'm way past having a soul.

514
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,915
[screams, groans]

515
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:03,918
[groans]

516
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:05,836
[grunts]

517
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,966
I keep hoping that you'd do
something different.

518
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,303
I figured if someone was
gonna give me a challenge,

519
00:34:14,386 --> 00:34:15,346
it'd be you.

520
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:17,348
But nope.

521
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,225
- [Shang groans]
- [Kano] We're here again.

522
00:34:19,850 --> 00:34:20,851
You.

523
00:34:20,935 --> 00:34:22,645
- You're the same...
- [groaning]

524
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,231
...manipulating, sniveling sorcerer

525
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:27,024
that underestimates those around him.

526
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,151
[groans]

527
00:34:29,235 --> 00:34:32,613
You can't beat me!

528
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:36,283
- [groans]
- No one can.

529
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:44,124
- I made this world.
- [groans]

530
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:45,584
- And I'll make it...
- [groaning]

531
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,753
...again and again and again.

532
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:50,464
- Better luck next time.
- [groans]

533
00:34:50,923 --> 00:34:53,217
[groaning]

534
00:34:55,386 --> 00:34:57,888
No one beats Kano.

535
00:34:58,389 --> 00:34:59,556
No one!

536
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,560
[all cheering] Kano! Kano! Kano!

537
00:35:05,396 --> 00:35:08,357
[Kenshi groaning]

538
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:14,613
No, no... Sh... Shang Tsung...

539
00:35:15,281 --> 00:35:17,574
[groans] My... my eyes.

540
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,452
Stop!

541
00:35:21,161 --> 00:35:22,121
Rise!

542
00:35:22,204 --> 00:35:23,330
[pants]

543
00:35:23,414 --> 00:35:24,540
[Kuai Liang] Calm yourself.

544
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:30,254
Where... Where am I?

545
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:31,839
In my home.

546
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,133
Here. Drink this.

547
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:41,598
Slowly. I have more.

548
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:43,767
Thank you.

549
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:45,477
Who... Whoever you are.

550
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,313
My name is Kuai Liang.

551
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,857
But you can call me "old man,"

552
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:51,984
as you did in the marketplace.

553
00:35:53,110 --> 00:35:56,697
Kuai, the... the Lin Kuei.

554
00:35:57,531 --> 00:35:59,992
I'm... I'm sorry. About before.

555
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,994
Thank you for... for helping me.

556
00:36:02,077 --> 00:36:03,037
I'm not helping you.

557
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:06,206
If you died on my land,
it might attract the revenants.

558
00:36:07,124 --> 00:36:09,043
You can rest here until you can stand.

559
00:36:09,126 --> 00:36:11,128
But then, I want you gone.

560
00:36:11,962 --> 00:36:13,213
Why wait?

561
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,215
I came with a sword.
Where... Where is it?

562
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,773
[groaning]

563
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,775
You obviously aren't strong enough yet.

564
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,443
- You can...
- No.

565
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,237
I don't want to burden you
with my presence.

566
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:40,115
[grunting]

567
00:36:40,657 --> 00:36:41,867
Watch out. There's a...

568
00:36:43,410 --> 00:36:44,244
Table.

569
00:36:47,498 --> 00:36:49,124
[groans]

570
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:52,669
My sword! [breathing heavily]

571
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:54,755
[screams in frustration]

572
00:36:55,589 --> 00:36:57,216
It doesn't matter.

573
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,759
Nothing does.

574
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,260
[sighs] Not anymore.

575
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,762
Even with this blade,

576
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,556
I am half the man I once was.

577
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,394
When I first met you,
you were so full of pride,

578
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,771
looking to be the best warrior.

579
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:12,564
Isn't that what you told me?

580
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:13,732
That was before.

581
00:37:14,149 --> 00:37:16,402
- Before you were blind.
- Before I was beaten.

582
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,779
Before I was tricked by Shang Tsung.

583
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,784
So, without sight, you are useless?

584
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,496
Then it is as I said before.

585
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,081
You know nothing.

586
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:30,666
You're just a child.

587
00:37:31,542 --> 00:37:34,503
If you're going to kill yourself,
be quick about it

588
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:36,880
so I can bury you before the sun rises.

589
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,466
[grunting]

590
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:42,970
[grunts]

591
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:44,847
[groans softly]

592
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:46,807
He took my honor.

593
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:48,142
[sighs wearily]

594
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,853
There is more to life than honor.

595
00:37:51,645 --> 00:37:53,647
- Like what?
- Like living.

596
00:37:54,231 --> 00:37:55,441
Like survival.

597
00:37:57,025 --> 00:37:59,319
- Where are you going?
- Inside.

598
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,988
Come, if you can.

599
00:38:01,864 --> 00:38:04,741
Tomorrow, I will teach you
to use your senses.

600
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:07,619
So I can find Shang Tsung.

601
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,872
No, I will only teach you to live.

602
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:11,540
Not to die.

603
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,333
Do you understand?

604
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:17,296
Rest for now.

605
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,381
Tomorrow, we train.

606
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,739
- Catch the chicken.
- [clucking]

607
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:45,949
- How do I catch... Argh!
- By not talking.

608
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:47,493
Listen.

609
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:50,662
- Hear the wind.
- [wind blowing]

610
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:53,373
- Hear the corn stalks rustling.
- [rustling]

611
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,584
Yes.

612
00:38:56,752 --> 00:38:57,794
Those don't matter.

613
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,838
The only thing that matters

614
00:38:59,922 --> 00:39:01,215
- is this chicken.
- [clucking]

615
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,260
- [grunting]
- [clucking continues]

00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:16,832
[energy pulsating]

630
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,084
What hangs on the wall over there?

631
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,503
- [Kenshi] It glows.
- [energy pulsating]

632
00:40:21,587 --> 00:40:23,088
It's powerful.

633
00:40:24,298 --> 00:40:25,465
A promise.

634
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:31,430
As I thought, the sword,
it allows you to see.

635
00:40:31,763 --> 00:40:32,723
How did you...

636
00:40:32,806 --> 00:40:35,517
It is not the first magic
I have come across.

637
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:38,145
Its name is Sento.

638
00:40:39,688 --> 00:40:41,648
It... It speaks to me.

639
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,317
It whispers.

640
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:46,653
When I hold it, I can see.

641
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:47,988
Sort of.

642
00:40:48,488 --> 00:40:49,906
Explain.

643
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:52,159
It's hard to. It's...

644
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:57,080
It's like, when you stare at a flame,
and then you look away,

645
00:40:57,164 --> 00:40:59,541
you see the light of the flame
even though it's gone.

646
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:03,086
It's like that,
but there's something else.

647
00:41:12,721 --> 00:41:14,139
- [sighs]
- [sword thuds]

648
00:41:15,349 --> 00:41:18,268
That is... something.

649
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,855
Yes. I think...

650
00:41:22,314 --> 00:41:24,399
[mumbling]

651
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,485
I can...

652
00:41:27,277 --> 00:41:30,906
Hey, what did you put in this soup?

653
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:32,699
A sleeping elixir.

654
00:41:33,241 --> 00:41:34,409
You should have used your nose.

655
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:43,835
[breathing heavily]

656
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:52,719

No! Brother, no!

662
00:42:03,188 --> 00:42:04,189
Brother?

663
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:05,899
I am not your brother.

664
00:42:06,775 --> 00:42:08,902
I am you.

665
00:42:09,986 --> 00:42:11,029
No!

666
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:12,489
Yes.

[gasps]

00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,205
You must have been dreaming.

672
00:42:20,956 --> 00:42:21,957
I thought that maybe...

673
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,458
Good. You're up.

674
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:24,918
Come with me.

675
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,425
Ready?

676
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,635
No! What am I doing?

You call the blade and slice the melon

before it hits you in the face.

681

And if it doesn't work?

Just finish it. This isn't working.

There's nothing to believe in.

701
00:43:44,915 --> 00:43:47,918
Once, I was a great warrior.

No one could beat me. No one.

703

Despite the horrors
of the world, I had that.

And now...

705
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:58,970
Now I'm a blind man
who chases chickens all day.

And that is what you will always be.

And that is why you fail. [sighs]

Do you know why I agreed to train you?

709
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,648
You felt sorry for me.

710
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:10,607
No.

711
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,276
Because I've been where you are now.

712
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,405
So low that the only thing
you pray for is your death.

713
00:44:18,198 --> 00:44:21,743
But I learned only children
blame their circumstance.

Men change their circumstance.

715

- I can't.
- Do it.

Or I will get your beloved sword
and end this right now.

Am I not louder than a chicken?

There is nothing more poisonous
than "I can't."

You can, if you believe.

Even if all of heaven and hell
are allied against you.

Yes.

Do you know what cryomancy is?

No.

For a long time,

781
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:43,296
I thought the worst thing that
I could become was my brother.

782
00:48:44,214 --> 00:48:45,757
I was wrong.

783
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:49,052

When it was all over,
I was the only one to survive.

787
00:49:02,649 --> 00:49:03,900
And I realized

788
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:07,195
<i>that death begets death.</i>

789
00:49:08,238 --> 00:49:11,407
And the cycle of violence continues,

792
00:49:17,789 --> 00:49:21,668
I swore an oath
never to use my power again.

793
00:49:23,086 --> 00:49:25,463
Never to lose control.

794

Even if it's a worthy cause?

795
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:32,595
What's "worthy"?
If I start fighting, I won't stop.

And then the storm will return.

I taught you so you could live.
Remember?

You taught me to help those in need.

846
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:59,260
- No. That's not what...
- Of course you did!

847
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:01,220
Where would I be
if you didn't pick me up?

If you didn't train me?

It's not the same. I can't...

There is nothing more poisonous
than "I can't."

Don't men change their circumstances?

Or is everything you said a lie?

I can't let you go.

I'm not Lin Kuei, remember?

Before I lost my eyes,
I would have said yes.

But you've taught me a better way.

No. No, I can't live a good life

to help others and didn't.

Doing what's right isn't pride.

It's honor. You showed me that.

you can beat me?

Well, when I come back,

1106
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,887
I'll show you what cold-hearted is.

1108

[Kano] Confused, eh?

1109
01:12:41,691 --> 01:12:44,194
Well, to be honest,
I was too, the first time I saw it.

1110
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:47,239
It's called Kronika's Hourglass,

1111
01:12:47,322 --> 01:12:51,201
and with it,
I can rewrite time and history.

1112
01:12:52,118 --> 01:12:54,955
You... You did this?

1113
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:56,122
[Kano] Yeah, I did.

1114
01:12:56,206 --> 01:13:00,043
I made those punters,
like Shang Tsung, grovel at my feet,

1115
01:13:00,126 --> 01:13:01,378
the way they deserve to.

1116
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:04,839
The Wasteland? The revenants?

1117
01:13:04,923 --> 01:13:07,008
Well, how better
to control the masses, eh,

1118
01:13:07,092 --> 01:13:09,010
but keep them afraid of something.

1119
01:13:09,094 --> 01:13:10,011
But to be honest,

1120
01:13:10,095 --> 01:13:12,722
it was all getting
a bit boring, you know?

1121
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:14,558
Then you appeared.

1122
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:18,395
Hey, what made you take up
your snowballs and give it a go?

1123
01:13:18,937 --> 01:13:21,147
I finally realized

1124
01:13:21,231 --> 01:13:24,317
there's no honor in standing by

1125
01:13:24,401 --> 01:13:27,654
while the world is destroyed around you.

1126
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:31,116
I prefer "made in my image."

1127
01:13:31,908 --> 01:13:34,077
Anyway, better luck next time,

01:15:19,015 --> 01:15:20,016
I tell you what.

1147
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:23,603
Kneel before me and pledge your loyalty,

1148
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:27,857
and I'll set you up as king
in... Uh, I don't know.

- Where's Kano?
- Lying around.

1159
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:11,294
[Kenshi] Now that Kano is gone,
the Wasteland can be free.

1160
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:13,963
You and I can root out
the revenants, and we can...

1161
01:17:14,047 --> 01:17:15,590
- No.
- No?

1162
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,469
You were right.

1163
01:17:20,303 --> 01:17:22,138
Using what you know to help others.

1164
01:17:23,056 --> 01:17:25,099
Something I forgot
somewhere along the way.

1165
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:29,479
Because of you,
I have some sense of honor again.

1166
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:31,564
Thank you.

1167
01:17:32,732 --> 01:17:35,360
Then work with me
to help the people of the Wasteland.

1168
01:17:35,902 --> 01:17:38,112
Remember what I said about my power?

1169
01:17:38,905 --> 01:17:41,407
I can feel it even now.

1170
01:17:42,075 --> 01:17:44,202
It can't be controlled.

1171
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:46,412
I made a promise,

1172
01:17:47,163 --> 01:17:49,624
and if I don't keep it, he will.

1173
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:54,254
What promise?
What are you talking about?

1174
01:17:54,337 --> 01:17:55,630
We can start over.

1175
01:17:56,089 --> 01:17:58,174
We can recreate the Lin Kuei,
and we can...

1176
01:17:58,258 --> 01:17:59,467

I don't understand.
The Lin Kuei, your legacy...

You are the Lin Kuei now.

Protect Earth realm,

1182
01:18:22,448 --> 01:18:23,950
