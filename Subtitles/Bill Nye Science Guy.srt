00:00:25,858 --> 00:00:29,362
[people chattering]

3
00:00:56,823 --> 00:00:59,759
Bill Nye's just such
a charismatic individual,

4
00:00:59,826 --> 00:01:04,831
and he just inspires the
enthusiasm for the love of
science, love of life.

5
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:12,672
[announcer] Currently, he is
traveling the country speaking
about climate change,

6
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,442
science and space exploration.

7
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,711
I grew up watching Bill Nye,
and it was live action,

8
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:20,747
and, like, kids did it, and I
was a kid.

9
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:22,815
I was, like, "I could do this."
I'm a doctor.

10
00:01:22,882 --> 00:01:24,851
And, uh, I do
infectious disease, actually.

11
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,655
I think science is everything.
It connects us all.

12
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:30,757
[announcer] While working on his
TV show,

13
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:35,328
he won a total of 18 Emmys
in just five years.

14
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:39,632
[man] When it was a rainy day or
the teacher wasn't feeling so
well,

15
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,802
you would just see the TV cart
come in and the VHS, and you
just hear,

16
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,339
"Bill, Bill, Bill!" That's how
you knew.

17
00:01:46,406 --> 00:01:48,441
The whole class was so happy.
It was just a perfect moment.

18
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,877
[crowd chanting] Bill! Bill!
Bill!

19
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,781
[announcer] Please join me in
welcoming

20
00:01:54,847 --> 00:01:58,751
America's favorite scientist
Bill Nye the Science Guy.

21
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:00,853
[upbeat music playing]

22
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,822
[crowd cheering]

23
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:06,493
[man on videotape] Bill, Bill,
Bill, Bill! Bill Nye the Science
Guy!

24
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:14,901
[Bill Nye] Whoo!
Oh, I love you guys! Greetings!

25
00:02:15,402 --> 00:02:17,870
[whooping]

26
00:02:27,447 --> 00:02:30,183
[instrumental music playing]

27
00:02:56,075 --> 00:02:58,411
Just the start of things. We're
getting things wrapped up here.

28
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,280
We're taxiing out. We're gonna
take off,

29
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,284
and we're gonna see if these
wings develop a difference in
air pressure.

30
00:03:05,818 --> 00:03:08,421
[Nye] So it was really the 1990s

31
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,458
that I started feeling bad
about the United States,

32
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,593
and its relationship to science.

33
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,995
[indistinct]

34
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:21,334
I wanted to make a world where
young people were excited about
science again,

35
00:03:22,935 --> 00:03:24,671
and that set me on a quest.

36
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,873
[man] Okay, Bill, go!

37
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,242
It's a pretty good day for
parasailing!

38
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:32,612
[loud thud]

39
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,249
[wind blowing]

40
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:40,553
Bill himself was the face of the
Bill Nye the Science Guy show.

41
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,688
Uh...

42
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:46,659
But there really was this
triangle, the three creators of
the show.

43
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:48,761
Bill, Jim and Erren.

44
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:51,664
There was this creative energy

45
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,000
that I don't think has ever
quite been replicated.

46
00:03:55,134 --> 00:03:57,437
Jim, writer-director,

47
00:03:57,504 --> 00:04:00,407
could really challenge Bill and
bring out the best in Bill,

48
00:04:01,474 --> 00:04:04,544
and Erren, who was the mama bear
of the whole organization.

49
00:04:05,512 --> 00:04:07,547
She was the consummate producer.

50
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:13,486
We should... Where is that home
movie?

51
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,757
So, all the video that we know
of that is left of the show is
right here.

52
00:04:17,824 --> 00:04:19,726
[Erren Gottlieb] Oh, my gosh!

53
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,896
This is all of the research.
Background information, shows...

54
00:04:24,631 --> 00:04:28,034
America needed scientists.
We'd see PBS stories,

55
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,837
Time Magazine,
Newsweeks about this crisis.

56
00:04:30,903 --> 00:04:32,305
There are no scientists out
there.

57
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:33,473
We're going, "Well, we've got
this scientist right here.

58
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,110
We can do this." So we set out
to make this Bill Nye the
Science Guy TV show.

59
00:04:38,177 --> 00:04:41,348
Oh, man. What a mug!
What a mug on this guy!

60
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:45,518
That was pretty much a silly
venture, that we thought that we
could produce

61
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,587
this national show out of
Seattle.

62
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:52,425
But I don't think anyone ever
expected that it would become
what it became.

63
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:08,040
The main stage where most
of the show took place

64
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:09,976
is right on the other side
of that brick wall,

65
00:05:11,744 --> 00:05:15,081
and one of the most popular
shows is the gravity show.

66
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:18,751
And we threw stuff off that
roof.

67
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:22,922
[static]

68
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:26,626
The pull of gravity isn't so
strong that we can't raise our
arms or anything,

69
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,795
but it does pull on everything
all the time.

70
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,129
Now, we can test this.

71
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,632
This is an old idea, but a good
one.

72
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:35,568
Watermelon!

73
00:05:38,605 --> 00:05:39,472
Ah!

74
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,442
A computer, sure!

75
00:05:45,612 --> 00:05:49,882
I think the zaniness, uh,
was a great tension reliever

76
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,820
for all the kids in the audience
who were afraid they couldn't
understand something.

77
00:05:55,788 --> 00:05:58,925
Before they knew what was
happening, they understood.

78
00:06:00,827 --> 00:06:01,661
Science!

79
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:05,632
He's the science teacher we all
wish we had in elementary school

80
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,800
or in middle school,
high school or even college.

81
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:12,171
Here's the fastest thing in the
universe. It's light!

82
00:06:12,238 --> 00:06:16,042
Light goes 300,000 kilometers
every second.

83
00:06:16,108 --> 00:06:16,876
[electricity buzzing]

84
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,112
Things in the universe...

85
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,948
[Neil deGrasse Tyson] The
Science Guy show contained the
science that excited Bill,

86
00:06:23,015 --> 00:06:27,820
and you, the viewer, can't help
but be just as excited as the
instructor.

87
00:06:28,655 --> 00:06:30,990
It was a game changer for an
entire generation of people.

88
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:34,927
There's only 92
naturally occurring elements.

89
00:06:34,994 --> 00:06:38,064
But if you think about it, you
can think of a lot more than 92
things.

90
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:39,766
[explosion]

91
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,503
They're all made of the elements
listed on this table.

92
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,137
So they're grouped together...

93
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,906
[Emily Graslie] Bill Nye days in
school were the best.

94
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:50,977
When the teacher plugged in the
VCR, you knew you were going to
walk away

95
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,580
having learned something, and
having enjoyed learning
something.

96
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,516
Which, for some reason,
is a novel thing in schools.

97
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:59,586
See the air rushing
over the blades of grass,

98
00:06:59,652 --> 00:07:02,489
taking carbon dioxide from the
air,

99
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,924
light from the sun and water...

100
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,060
the grass is making its own
food. It's growing.

101
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:12,865
The point was, anybody can be a
scientist. Any kid. Anybody.

102
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,633
[static]

103
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,702
[goofy sound effects]

104
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,606
The cone built up the negative
charge. That's what pulled the
water molecules.

105
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,007
[both] Static!

106
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:27,079
We always told Bill that he
should be the next Carl Sagan.
That's the plan.

107
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,550
Science is a self-correcting
process.

108
00:07:30,983 --> 00:07:33,720
To be accepted, new ideas must
survive

109
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:37,524
the most rigorous standards
of evidence and scrutiny.

110
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:43,563
The suppression of uncomfortable
ideas may be common in religion
or in politics,

111
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,665
but it is not the path to
knowledge,

112
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,035
and there's no place for it
in the endeavor of science.

113
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,874
[Nye] I studied mechanical
engineering at Cornell
University.

114
00:07:56,609 --> 00:08:00,479
I decided to take astronomy from
this famous professor, Carl
Sagan.

115
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:07,253
He was a great scientist, and
when I had my chance to do my
Science Guy show,

116
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,055
I went back to Carl Sagan.

117
00:08:10,422 --> 00:08:13,960
And he said, "You should focus
on pure science.

118
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,998
Don't do science demonstrations
without describing the bigger
idea."

119
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,236
What he said was,
kids resonate to science.

120
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:27,073
That was the verb he used.
Resonate.

121
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:29,275
And I really embraced that.

122
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:35,514
I will now open the door with my
mind.

123
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:41,588
I am influencing physical
objects around me with the power
of my brain.

124
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,692
Do you think I did,
or did it just look that way?

125
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,960
We have a saying in science.

126
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,565
"Extraordinary claims
require extraordinary proof."

127
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:57,236
The process of testing claims,
the world is flat, the world is
round,

128
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,806
is what we call science.

129
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,877
There has always been this
little behind- the-scenes thing
between scientists.

130
00:09:04,944 --> 00:09:07,246
"Is Bill really a scientist?
He doesn't have a PhD."

131
00:09:08,948 --> 00:09:12,018
We catapulted Bill into who he
is.

132
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:19,892
But it is a big step to go from
this television host, kid goofy
guy,

133
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,131
to a really well-respected
expert.

134
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,837
[whirring]

135
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:43,215
[whistling]

136
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,051
[blows]

137
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,422
[Nye] So the Science Guy show is
over.

138
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,892
We did 100 shows. It almost
killed me,

139
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:56,228
and I gotta move on to something
bigger.

140
00:09:57,363 --> 00:10:02,168
But the frustrating thing is, I
would continually be asked to be
on

141
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,837
the news as a commentator,

142
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:08,340
about the weather especially,
and about climate change.

143
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,109
Bill, over to you.

144
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,944
The problem is, we're just
burning carbon

145
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,847
and spewing carbon dioxide in
the atmosphere at an
extraordinary rate.

146
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,383
What Bill Nye just did was waste
everyone's time explaining

147
00:10:17,449 --> 00:10:18,751
that C02 is rising.

148
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:21,020
Bill Nye is just going around
saying, "C02 is up.

149
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:22,388
Therefore, global warming is
dangerous.

150
00:10:22,454 --> 00:10:26,058
We should be concerned." It's
not. It's not dangerous.

151
00:10:27,459 --> 00:10:30,897
The world is getting warmer.
It's continually getting warmer.

152
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,134
If I'm right, the reversals will
lead to a degree, to a degree
and a half cooling.

153
00:10:35,201 --> 00:10:39,238
If you're right, they're not.
But what are we worried about
right now?

154
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,339
Okay.

155
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:41,741
[Nye] We have this increasing

156
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:45,244
anti-science movement
in the United States.

157
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,314
Our president is worried
about global warming.

158
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,382
What a ridiculous situation.

159
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,152
All right, that was Donald Trump
calling out President Obama.

160
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:54,453
It seems our commander in chief
is...

161
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,355
[Nye] It's worse than ever.

162
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,659
The anti-science movement is
more powerful than it's ever
been.

163
00:11:01,393 --> 00:11:04,964
Charles Darwin never thought of
evolution as anything other than
a theory.

164
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,900
He hoped that someday it would
be proven by the fossil record,

165
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:11,170
but did not live to see that,
nor have we.

166
00:11:11,503 --> 00:11:13,472
[Nye] The longer we put off
doing something about it,

167
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,141
the more serious it's gonna get.

168
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:25,117
It's this problem where the
anti-science people have been so
successful.

169
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:29,889
I mean, there's this guy in
Kentucky who doesn't believe in
evolution,

170
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:33,926
who doesn't believe in the
fundamental idea in all of
biology.

171
00:11:34,226 --> 00:11:35,795
[Ken Ham] I don't believe that
at all.

172
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,930
I don't believe that dinosaurs
lived millions of years ago,

173
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,832
and I certainly don't believe

174
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,835
that you came from ape-like
creatures, or anything like
that.

175
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,804
I mean, did your grandfather
look like that?

176
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,405
[kids laughing]

177
00:11:46,472 --> 00:11:49,008
I don't think so. Does your
grandmother look like that?

178
00:11:49,275 --> 00:11:53,012
No, not at all. You're very,
very different to...

179
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:55,081
[Nye] If we raise a generation
of kids,

180
00:11:55,147 --> 00:11:57,850
they can't think critically,
they can't think scientifically,

181
00:11:57,917 --> 00:11:59,351
we're headed for trouble.

182
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:01,520
We don't believe in evolution,

183
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,124
and I certainly don't believe
that life came about by chance,

184
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:09,261
random processes millions of
years ago in some soup in the
sea,

185
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,430
life was formed
and then one kind of animal...

186
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:14,834
What has evolution
got to do with engineering?

187
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,337
I mean, Bill Nye himself
actually is not a scientist.

188
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,472
He studied mechanical
engineering.

189
00:12:21,607 --> 00:12:25,011
As a science educator, I'm
really more serious about it
than ever,

190
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,013
these people who are denying
science,

191
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:30,249
denying evolution, denying the
efficacy of vaccinations,

192
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,186
and especially denying
human-caused climate change.

193
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,056
We just can't have this.
We've got to fight this fight.

194
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,925
I have got to fight this fight.

195
00:12:57,643 --> 00:13:00,446
[people chattering]

196
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,887
[growling]

197
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:19,999
[Nye] Now, this is
scientifically inaccurate.

198
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:24,170
Humans and ancient dinosaurs
did not live at the same time.

199
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:26,172
The evidence for that is
overwhelming,

200
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:30,009
and to suggest this to
schoolchildren is irresponsible
at best.

201
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,012
It's very troubling.

202
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:37,149
[snarling]

203
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:47,393
The Head Minister, Ken Ham,
challenged me to a debate.

204
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,263
And after consideration, I
accepted it.

205
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,910
[Eugenie Scott] Ken Ham is the
most successful creationist

206
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,077
in the United States.

207
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:10,516
I first heard about the debate
when Bill sent me an email
saying,

208
00:14:10,582 --> 00:14:13,285
"Hey, I've signed a contract
to debate Ken Ham.

209
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,686
Can I talk to a couple of your
people?"

210
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,923
[chuckles] And I wrote back
saying,

211
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:20,492
"Seriously? Do you realize
what you've gotten into?"

212
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,999
Debates between scientists
and science deniers

213
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:31,503
could be a trap that scientists
probably should not get involved
in.

214
00:14:34,606 --> 00:14:37,509
[Nye] Well,
they present Lucy as a gorilla.

215
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:41,247
And in mainstream science,
Lucy stands upright.

216
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,449
And she has a lot less hair.

217
00:14:44,183 --> 00:14:46,018
You will not see that
in a mainstream museum.

218
00:14:47,586 --> 00:14:52,124
Understand that in mainstream
science, when we find this, we
consider evidence.

219
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,327
[Jerry Coyne] The Creation
Museum is a temple of ignorance,

220
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,063
but it's also a temple of lies.

221
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:01,400
And warping the minds of
children,

222
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:04,603
which is what the Creation
Museum is dedicated to doing,

223
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,042
is one of the most awful and
mendacious things I think
anybody can do.

224
00:15:11,277 --> 00:15:14,680
[recording of gunfire
and people screaming playing]

225
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,559
There's a lot of anxiety
and concern about evolution,

226
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:32,264
because people see it as somehow
incompatible with religious
beliefs.

227
00:15:32,331 --> 00:15:34,100
I'm a believer in God myself,

228
00:15:35,934 --> 00:15:40,672
and I don't, at the present
time, see any conflicts between
understanding

229
00:15:40,739 --> 00:15:44,010
the nature of living things and
how they're related to each
other,

230
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:48,347
and what I believe as someone
who perceives God as the
creator.

231
00:15:50,082 --> 00:15:53,785
You can find fossils in the DNA
of humans.

232
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,722
Genes that don't work anymore,
and haven't worked for a long
time.

233
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:58,224
They're called "pseudo genes,"

234
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,728
and they're on the same place in
the human as they are in the
chimpanzee.

235
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:08,134
Unless you're gonna say that God
was playing a trick by hiding
some sort of

236
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,072
misleading clue, you have to
conclude that we had a common
ancestor.

237
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:25,684
Bill has an opportunity,
and has taken that on

238
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,019
in his discussion with Ken Ham,

239
00:16:27,086 --> 00:16:30,556
to try to explain
what the scientific facts are.

240
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:32,624
I'm Tom Foreman from CNN,

241
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:37,829
and I'm pleased to be tonight's
moderator for this
evolution-versus-creation
debate.

242
00:16:37,896 --> 00:16:42,301
And now let's welcome our
debaters, Mr. Bill Nye and Mr.
Ken Ham.

243
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,203
[cheering and applause]

244
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,076
[Tom Foreman]
Mr. Ham, you opted to go first.

245
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:55,814
You cannot ever prove, using,
uh, the scientific method in the
present,

246
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:59,118
you can't prove the age of the
Earth. So you can never prove
it's old.

247
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:00,919
Mr. Nye?

248
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:03,322
Well, of course this is where we
disagree. You can prove the age
of the Earth

249
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,856
with great robustness.

250
00:17:04,923 --> 00:17:09,161
Radiometric dating does exist.
The universe is accelerating.

251
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:10,762
These are all provable facts.

252
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:13,899
I just want people to understand
too that there's aspects about
the past

253
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:17,303
that you can't scientifically
prove because you weren't there.

254
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:20,038
We can be investigating, uh, the
present.

255
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,508
Understanding the past
is a whole different matter,

256
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:24,643
and, uh, let me just say this.
My answers...

257
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,247
[Coyne] To say that evolution
is somehow questionable

258
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:31,483
because we only have the
historical remnants of the
process

259
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,120
is a complete misunderstanding
of how science operates.

260
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,255
We have so much evidence
in the fossil record.

261
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:38,557
We have so much evidence from
our DNA.

262
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:41,160
We have so much evidence from
embryology

263
00:17:41,227 --> 00:17:45,664
that you don't need to see it
happen, because we have the
historical record.

264
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,534
It's like trying to deny
that Napoleon existed.

265
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,370
Mr. Nye, the next question is
for you.

266
00:17:51,437 --> 00:17:54,173
How did the atoms that created
the Big Bang get there?

267
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,143
This is the great mystery.
This is what drives us.

268
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,878
This is what we want to know.
Let's keep looking. Let's keep
searching.

269
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,649
Bill, I just want to let you
know that there actually is a
book out there

270
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,784
that tells us where matter came
from.

271
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:07,153
[audience laughing]

272
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,922
Mr. Ham, this is a simple
question, I suppose,

273
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,293
but one that actually is fairly
profound for all of us in our
lives.

274
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:18,397
What, if anything,
would ever change your mind?

275
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,299
[Ham] Hmm.

276
00:18:26,838 --> 00:18:30,509
Well, the answer to that
question is, I'm a Christian.

277
00:18:31,977 --> 00:18:34,346
And the Bible is the word of
God.

278
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,250
No one is ever gonna convince me
that the word of God is not
true.

279
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:39,185
[Foreman] Mr. Nye?

280
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:41,787
[Nye] We would just need
one piece of evidence.

281
00:18:41,853 --> 00:18:44,590
We would need evidence that the
universe is not expanding.

282
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,526
We would need evidence that the
stars appear to be far away, but
they're not.

283
00:18:47,726 --> 00:18:51,263
That rock layers can somehow
form in just 4,000 years.

284
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,634
Bring on any of those things,
and you would change me
immediately.

285
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:59,905
[Scott] That last question just
so crystallized this whole
debate,

286
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:05,911
and I think the answers of both
Ken and Bill were very, very
telling.

287
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:09,181
Is Ken Ham's creation model
viable?

288
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:14,486
I... I say no. Absolutely not.
Thank you very much.

289
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:17,723
-Thanks so much to Mr. Nye and
Mr. Ham... -[audience cheering]

290
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:19,725
...for an excellent discussion.

291
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,766
Thank you. Goodnight from
Petersburg, Kentucky and the
Creation Museum.

292
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,737
[tweeting]

293
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:34,540
[keyboard clacking]

294
00:19:58,430 --> 00:19:59,798
-May I touch these things?
-Sure.

295
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,800
I know you're not supposed
to touch science demonstrations.

296
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,736
That's conventional Newton,
but what happens here

297
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:09,241
when they're in different, uh...
Oh, it's a wave. That's
beautiful.

298
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:13,645
There was a point where I had
thought that Bill Nye was dead,

299
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:16,548
because he was no longer putting
out any kind of informational
videos

300
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,016
trying to teach kids about
science.

301
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,652
-[woman] Love you, Bill! -Thank
you. Good morning. Good morning.

302
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,721
He did disappear for a little
bit, and everybody was, like,

303
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:24,723
"Where did the Science Guy go?"

304
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,025
What is he, "Soil Man"? Who is
he?

305
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:30,762
Well, we are teaching forensics,
and he is our, uh...

306
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:31,697
He's dead.

307
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:33,265
[audience cheering]

308
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,744
[Nye] It's the National Science
Teacher Convention.

309
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,847
These are the people, man.
These are the science teachers.

310
00:20:49,715 --> 00:20:51,016
They're really the fans.

311
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:57,989
People still watch Bill Nye the
Science Guy in school.

312
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,693
Teachers showed it in class
for years and years.

313
00:21:02,694 --> 00:21:05,497
Greetings, greetings!
It's great to see you all,

314
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,966
and I'm very happy that,
as I understand it,

315
00:21:08,033 --> 00:21:11,102
I've been teaching
a lot of your classes this year.

316
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,438
[audience laughing]

317
00:21:12,738 --> 00:21:13,405
Here we go.

318
00:21:13,472 --> 00:21:14,740
[indistinct chatter]

319
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,611
-Whoa, whoa.
-One more, Bill, thank you.

320
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:21,947
There you are. Hey.

321
00:21:22,013 --> 00:21:23,281
-Thank you.
-Cool.

322
00:21:23,649 --> 00:21:24,516
-Hey, cool.
-Thank you.

323
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:26,385
[exclaims]

324
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,386
Hey...

325
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,355
Go, go, go! [exclaims]

326
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:30,656
-Three, two...
-We got it. Yeah, yeah.

327
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,157
We don't need a countdown. Just
go for it.

328
00:21:32,223 --> 00:21:36,061
You've gotta reach out. You've
gotta go. Gotta turn it around.

329
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:38,096
-Catch up!
-All right, all right!

330
00:21:38,163 --> 00:21:40,432
How hard can it be? I'm not
sprinting.

331
00:21:40,499 --> 00:21:44,336
Reach out, man. You're too
close.

332
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,706
I was asked to talk about selfie
fatigue,

333
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,075
and I haven't.

334
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,310
I'm pretty sure it shortens your
life.

335
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:54,380
[exhales]

336
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,452
[audience cheering]

337
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:03,154
Now, you may have heard about
this thing I did last year.

338
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:06,558
I went to Kentucky and I took a
meeting with this guy

339
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,695
who insists that the Earth
is 6,000 years old.

340
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,463
[laughing]

341
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:14,433
So, along this line, the next
morning,

342
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,802
maybe you guys saw this,
it was all over the Internet.

343
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,670
[audience laughing]

344
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:27,078
Bill Nye knows a lot of science,
but when he gets off into
evolution, he's lying.

345
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,749
Dogs are always gonna be
canines. They always will be.

346
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:33,585
Felines will be felines.
That's real science.

347
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:40,392
"Client requests that Bill steer
clear of any controversial
topics."

348
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,762
"We also live in a pretty
conservative state,

349
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:46,665
so the climate-change
environmental conversation

350
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:50,802
wouldn't be well-received by
some members of our audience,
unfortunately."

351
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,072
That is unfortunate.

352
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,445
The main thing everybody could
do about climate change is talk
about it.

353
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:01,880
[cheering]

354
00:23:06,217 --> 00:23:07,586
Hi, you guys. Greetings,
greetings.

355
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,088
High five. Yes. Cool. Hi, you
guys.

356
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:11,957
[woman] I love science.

357
00:23:12,023 --> 00:23:13,859
We're reaching the end of the
line. I love you guys! Carry on.
One more! Ah!

358
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:19,030
The message I want to get across
today is that climate change is
serious business.

359
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:20,666
[crowd cheering]

360
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,435
Why is this country, which,
for over a century,

361
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:26,505
was the world leader in science,
engineering and innovation...

362
00:23:26,572 --> 00:23:30,408
[Nye] Nowadays I'm talking to
adults, and I'm not mincing
words.

363
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,778
The climate is changing. It's
our fault.

364
00:23:32,844 --> 00:23:34,179
We've gotta get to work on this.

365
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,086
So Sarah Palin was on this
panel.

366
00:23:42,688 --> 00:23:44,556
"Bill Nye is as much
of a scientist as I am.

367
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:46,725
He's a kid's show actor.
He's not a scientist."

368
00:23:48,727 --> 00:23:51,863
I want people to feel empowered
to ask questions about what is
being fed them

369
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,833
from the science community,
um... That, uh,

370
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,768
something's not making
a whole lot of sense

371
00:23:56,835 --> 00:24:02,508
when it comes to inconsistent
data that is being produced and
being fed,

372
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:03,875
especially to our children,

373
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:07,613
when it comes to global warming
or climate change.

374
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:08,880
Whatever they're calling it
today.

375
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:17,823
Man. That they can get on the
news,

376
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,092
and by "them," I mean
climate-change deniers,

377
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:24,062
they really are leaving the
world worse than they found it.

378
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:26,798
[man on video] Some of the most
trusted names in the weather
business

379
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:29,768
dispute that global warming
exists.

380
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:32,738
It turns out your favorite
TV meteorologist

381
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,640
may have more clout than you
think.

382
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:38,143
Surveys show Americans are more
likely to believe weather
forecasters

383
00:24:38,209 --> 00:24:40,712
than politicians,
when it comes to global warming.

384
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,581
And many of those forecasters
insist

385
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,916
that climate change poses
no imminent threat.

386
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:49,254
To think that we could affect
weather all that much is pretty
arrogant.

387
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,191
Mother Nature is so big. I think
we're gonna die from a lack of
fresh water,

388
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:55,661
or we're gonna die
from ocean acidification

389
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,530
before we die from global
warming, for sure.

390
00:24:58,764 --> 00:25:01,600
So, I was on CNN in the morning,

391
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,103
and I made an offhanded comment.
We were talking about floods in
Louisiana.

392
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,075
You know, here at CNN you have a
climate-change denier
meteorologist.

393
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,611
I doubt this one is even right.

394
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,681
[Nye] Knock yourselves out,
but this is a big problem.

395
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:20,619
And the next morning
Chad Myers posted this,

396
00:25:23,154 --> 00:25:26,625
succinctly saying,
"I have now changed my mind.

397
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:28,594
Had I flip-flopped?

398
00:25:30,261 --> 00:25:32,130
Well, that is what it would be
called in politics, but in
science,

399
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,132
it's just an evolution of
understanding."

400
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:38,336
As I tell my 11-year-old,

401
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:40,238
it's okay to be wrong,

402
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:42,741
as long as you learn from your
mistakes.

403
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:47,613
Chad Myers, I love you, man.
If we can get more,

404
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:52,718
as they're called nowadays,
thought leaders changing their
minds,

405
00:25:52,784 --> 00:25:54,319
maybe we can change the world.

406
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,255
[dog barking]

407
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,794
[toy train whistling]

408
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:06,632
[bell tolling]

409
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:17,008
[Nye] Load up some barrels.

410
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,110
[Nye whistling]

411
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:23,849
Here's the mark. Whoops.
That's got it. We're done.

412
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,355
[Nye laughing]

413
00:26:31,657 --> 00:26:33,324
Look, a couple of them land
upright. Come on.

414
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,129
But my brother has positioned
this building so close to the
track,

415
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:41,767
it can't get the barrels to land
in their official barrel
catcher.

416
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:47,806
Look out! Okay, I'm gonna do it.
Whee!

417
00:26:47,873 --> 00:26:48,874
[laughing]

418
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,744
So, our dad enabled this hobby.

419
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:55,546
[Darby Nye] He helped me with
it.

420
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:57,683
He's the one that bought the
trains in the first place for
me.

421
00:26:59,184 --> 00:27:01,286
[Nye] This car is 70 years old.

422
00:27:01,352 --> 00:27:03,421
[Darby] It's from a set from

423
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,924
A lot of the dates are stamped
on the car.

424
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:11,863
So 1955 was 61 years ago?

425
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:14,365
-[Darby] Sixty-one.
-Yeah.

426
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:15,867
That's a long time ago.

427
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:18,303
We're pretty close, Darby.

428
00:27:20,205 --> 00:27:22,373
[toy train whistling]

429
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,882
This is the house where my
family grew up.

430
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:35,186
My parents built this house,
and apparently, at that time,

431
00:27:36,221 --> 00:27:37,723
this was out in the country.

432
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,894
[rapid wooden rumbling]

433
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,932
That is a sound from my youth,
people, right there.

434
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,337
So, in here's the laundry room.

435
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:56,674
Right here is where I was
Bill Nye, boy scientist.

436
00:27:57,442 --> 00:27:59,745
But this is where I used to do
science experiments.

437
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:01,747
This was my little space
right about here.

438
00:28:07,953 --> 00:28:10,155
[Nye] Darb, were you here
when Dad fell down the stairs?

439
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,522
[Darby] He was carrying laundry.

440
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:12,457
He was doing something
he shouldn't have done.

441
00:28:13,524 --> 00:28:15,160
[Nye] Well, that's what you guys
say.

442
00:28:15,226 --> 00:28:17,996
But he was doing a thing that,
to an able-bodied person, is
routine.

443
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:21,166
This is what my sister talks
about all the time.

444
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:25,070
You just... You forget that
you can't do regular stuff.

445
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:41,152
[indistinct chatter]

446
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:48,026
[Steve Wilson] Bill is probably
one of the best friends I have.

447
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:55,801
The first time we met, Bill was
in a Steve Martin lookalike
contest.

448
00:28:57,468 --> 00:28:59,871
He was a guest and so I miked
him up.

449
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:03,809
He is true blue.

450
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:06,144
He's always there. He's a good
guy.

451
00:29:08,113 --> 00:29:10,248
[Nye] So I'm gonna try the
mystery song.

452
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,822
[Wilson speaking]

453
00:29:20,525 --> 00:29:21,392
Oh, it's, uh...

454
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:27,165
Um, Angie, "The Christmas Tree
Angel."

455
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:29,267
["The Christmas Tree Angel"
playing]

456
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:37,008
So, my mom used to sing this
song.

457
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:41,179
And I thought... Listen to that.

458
00:29:44,415 --> 00:29:45,984
Here they all come.

459
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:51,489
I used to cry. This is my mom.

460
00:29:53,524 --> 00:29:54,592
Wils, you're a mensch, man.

461
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:56,227
[laughing]

462
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:04,269
* All dressed up in stardust and
tinsel *

463
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,138
Amazing.

464
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,942
* Have a merry, merry, merry
Christmas said she *

465
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:18,449
[seagulls cawing]

466
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:22,020
[waves breaking]

467
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:31,429
[Nye] My mom was a big believer
in women doing everything.

468
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,009
During World War II, she was in
the Navy.

469
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,114
She was recruited
to work on the Enigma code.

470
00:30:51,649 --> 00:30:54,052
And so, she wasn't Rosy the
Riveter.

471
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:57,488
She was Rosy the Top-Secret Code
Breaker.

472
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,400
We had a very good family

473
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,271
My brother and sister loved me.

474
00:31:13,604 --> 00:31:15,373
We remain very close.

475
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:29,487
[Susan] Our family has a genetic
problem. It's called "ataxia."

476
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,357
It affects our, uh,

477
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:36,962
motor coordination
and our speech sometimes.

478
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:41,299
My brother Darby and I, we both
seem to be affected by it.

479
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:52,310
The ataxia, this thing where you
fall backwards and you catch
yourself...

480
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:53,511
You start to fall backwards...

481
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,314
It's cerebellar,
and it's related to balance.

482
00:31:56,747 --> 00:31:59,017
I've seen my brother do it,
I saw my dad do it.

483
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,518
And my sister...

484
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,254
-Well, she's way past that, I
gotta say. -[Wilson] Okay. Yeah.

485
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:09,227
So every time I lost my balance,
I'd presumed it was ataxia, so,
uh...

486
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,629
And part of the reason that, you
know,

487
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,598
-I never had kids and stuff...
-[Susan] Well, sure.

488
00:32:13,664 --> 00:32:16,434
...is because I was afraid
of passing this on.

489
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,602
[Susan] Right. Absolutely.

490
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,290
[laughing]

491
00:32:40,758 --> 00:32:42,693
What are you laugh... She's, you
know...

492
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,662
Because I can't stand up.

493
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,198
That is funny, you know.

494
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,400
That's the fence.

495
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:54,605
[Susan] Bill's so charming to
help us get along in life.

496
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,409
-[Nye] Do you want your little
feetsies? -[Susan] I do.

497
00:32:59,977 --> 00:33:03,214
And he helps us to cope with
what we have to deal with.

498
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:07,652
[Nye] That's true.

499
00:33:07,718 --> 00:33:10,021
-[Susan] You don't need to...
-[Nye] I was the obnoxious kid.

500
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,033
[beeping]

501
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,036
[Amy Bastian] Hold it there.

502
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:27,672
Okay, you can move your right
arm into the next triangle.

503
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,408
Go the other direction. Finger.

504
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:32,643
Nose.

505
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:34,545
Finger.

506
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:42,187
I don't see any change at all
from the last time we saw you.

507
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:43,621
-Oh, really? That's--
-Two years ago.

508
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:47,225
And right now I don't see
anything that looks ataxic.

509
00:33:57,835 --> 00:33:59,704
All right. I'm gonna look
at your eyes now.

510
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,373
What I want you to do
is focus right on my nose.

511
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,110
Open 'em nice and wide for me.
Now look at my finger.

512
00:34:06,477 --> 00:34:08,613
So you can see the beading
movements of her eyes?

513
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,382
And now look at my nose.

514
00:34:13,318 --> 00:34:16,354
Good, Susan. And slide it down.

515
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,291
Okay. Let's switch sides.

516
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,262
[Nye] I really worry
about my sister falling,

517
00:34:24,329 --> 00:34:25,796
or if something goes wrong.

518
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:32,270
Because I watched how ataxia
affected my dad's life,

519
00:34:32,337 --> 00:34:34,372
and look how it affected my
sister's life.

520
00:34:37,375 --> 00:34:41,212
So, I may have
a so-called survivor's guilt,

521
00:34:41,546 --> 00:34:44,081
where, "I don't have it?

522
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,783
Do I deserve to not have it?

523
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:49,387
What did I do that allows me
to not have it,

524
00:34:49,454 --> 00:34:51,889
where my beloved brother
and sister do have it?

525
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:55,593
What happened?
Do I owe the world a living?

526
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,631
If I were to have kids,
would they not have gotten it?"

527
00:35:03,668 --> 00:35:06,504
I am aware of how fortunate I
am.

528
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:10,775
It makes me all the more... It
motivates me all the more to do

529
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:13,844
something to leave the world
better than I found it.

530
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,162
Hey! Dude. Man.

531
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:33,298
-How you doing?
-Good.

532
00:35:34,499 --> 00:35:35,533
[Tyson] So what did you bring?

533
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,168
[Nye] Some Aveeno.

534
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:41,239
Very nice. What's gonna happen
is, if I'm drinking wine with my
man here,

535
00:35:41,439 --> 00:35:43,574
it's gonna have to be cosmic.
Just so you know.

536
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,477
[Nye] That's right.
He's proud of his 'stache.

537
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:47,945
[Tyson] Here you go.

538
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:49,880
-Rocket science!
-Yes!

539
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,718
That's the bottle I'm drinking
with Bill.

540
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,525
[Nye] We're living at this
extraordinary time where people
are anti-science.

541
00:36:01,058 --> 00:36:03,394
Anti-science in the country

542
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:08,533
that got to be preeminent
through its innovation.

543
00:36:08,599 --> 00:36:10,668
-[Tyson] Okay. Let me get on
your case. -[Nye] All right.

544
00:36:10,901 --> 00:36:13,571
-There's an entire generation of
people... -I know.

545
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:16,907
...who grew up looking at you in
their elementary school
classroom.

546
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,410
I know. It's all me.

547
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,812
-[laughing] It's all your fault!
-It's my fault.

548
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:24,582
-Whatever I did wrong...
-Where have you failed?

549
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:29,887
You had as much street cred as
is possible among
schoolchildren.

550
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:33,991
But somebody's gotta believe you
more than a childhood educator.

551
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,493
Yeah, yeah.

552
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,028
But I knew you had it in you.
I knew. We knew. We knew it.

553
00:36:38,095 --> 00:36:39,730
I went to the board...

554
00:36:39,797 --> 00:36:42,267
[Tyson] I serve on the board
of the Planetary Society.

555
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:46,471
Carl Sagan founded the Planetary
Society back in 1980.

556
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,240
[music playing on TV]

557
00:36:56,747 --> 00:36:58,816
Mars is the world next door.

558
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:03,854
The nearest planet on which
human explorers could safely
land.

559
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,890
[man on TV] The Planetary
Society,

560
00:37:05,956 --> 00:37:08,826
with Cornell University
astronomer Carl Sagan as its
president,

561
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,496
is the largest space interest
group on this planet,

562
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,965
with some 125,000 members
in over 60 of Earth's nations.

563
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:20,305
I and other board members
determined that the best thing
for the society

564
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:24,642
would be to have Bill become its
CEO.

565
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,386
So, here's gonna be where
the work's gonna get done.

566
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,489
Look at all of the space we have
for people. "Space," get it?

567
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:46,564
Before Bill took over, we had
been in a low point for some
time.

568
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:52,970
And Bill coming onboard started
to change us really
dramatically.

569
00:37:54,472 --> 00:37:58,576
One thing that's very important
to Bill is the Planetary
Society's solar sail launch.

570
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:01,512
It's been our mission since

571
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:03,548
[Johnny Carson] Isn't this
interesting.

572
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:07,352
Well, there's just a
tremendously exciting prospect
called "solar sailing."

573
00:38:07,418 --> 00:38:11,556
-"Solar sailing"?
-And this is a very crude model.

574
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,725
And it works exactly
as an ordinary sailboat does,

575
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:19,964
but it would travel on the
radiation and particles that
come out of the sun.

576
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,399
The wind from the sun.

577
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,837
[Tyson] If you look at old
footage of Carl Sagan on The
Tonight Show,

578
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:30,107
it's Carl Sagan unfurling a
model of a solar sail,

579
00:38:30,174 --> 00:38:33,844
describing that to Johnny Carson
and to the American public.

580
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:43,087
[Ann Druyan] Carl was so excited
about the solar sailing project.

581
00:38:43,788 --> 00:38:48,459
What could be more mythic
than riding the light?

582
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:59,570
[Nye] At the Planetary Society,
we are gonna launch LightSail.

583
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,108
When this thing gets in space,

584
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:10,981
Mylar sheets are deployed, and
the photons from the sun will
give it a push.

585
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:19,824
You never run out of fuel.

586
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,760
You could greatly lower the cost

587
00:39:22,827 --> 00:39:27,031
and make space exploration
accessible to many, many more
people.

588
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,343
We will be able to launch
spacecraft

589
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,413
and take them farther
and deeper into space.

590
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:55,426
[Druyan] It's the best shot we
have at getting to travel out
into the cosmos

591
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:58,629
on the scale of even the nearest
stars.

592
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,973
This is my office. This will be
my office.

593
00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:12,943
Carl Sagan changed my life,
and I am honored

594
00:40:13,811 --> 00:40:17,815
to be the CEO of the society
that he started. The Planetary
Society.

595
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:46,110
[indistinct chatter]

596
00:40:51,716 --> 00:40:54,652
[marching band playing]

597
00:40:57,655 --> 00:40:59,824
[cameras clicking]

598
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,229
[crowd applauding]

599
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,637
People from all over the world
have heard of Noah's Ark.

600
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:16,006
People say, "What are you really
doing here? What statement are
you making?"

601
00:41:16,306 --> 00:41:18,709
See, people haven't been taught
genetics correctly,

602
00:41:18,776 --> 00:41:21,846
haven't been taught about
speciation and natural selection
correctly.

603
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:24,649
We're gonna correct that in here
and undo

604
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:26,917
the brainwashing
that's occurred, uh, through...

605
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,853
[crowd cheering]

606
00:41:28,919 --> 00:41:32,156
I'm gonna challenge Bill Nye's
evolutionary worldview. So,
Bill,

607
00:41:32,623 --> 00:41:35,726
you're invited to come, and I'll
personally tour you through the
Ark.

608
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:37,595
You can do it ahead of opening,
if you want,

609
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:40,565
or you can do it after opening.
Whatever.

610
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:53,744
As we stand here, the Juno
spacecraft just went into orbit
around Jupiter,

611
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:59,183
which is an extraordinary
accomplishment of engineering
and rocket science.

612
00:41:59,249 --> 00:42:00,751
Here's anti-science.

613
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,655
[crowd applauding]

614
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:09,627
What do you say to those who
scoff at dinosaurs on the Ark?

615
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,163
People have so many
misconceptions about dinosaurs.

616
00:42:13,230 --> 00:42:16,734
You know, Bill Nye scoffs at me
for believing dinosaurs were on
the Ark,

617
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:20,905
but people like Bill Nye believe
dinosaurs grew feathers and
became birds.

618
00:42:21,138 --> 00:42:22,539
-It comes down to beliefs.
-[crowd laughing]

619
00:42:22,607 --> 00:42:25,710
It's a clash of worldviews.
That's what it's all about.

620
00:42:25,776 --> 00:42:27,244
[crowd applauding]

621
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:32,082
It's not a problem with
religion. I'm hip.

622
00:42:32,817 --> 00:42:34,819
The Earth's not 6,000 years old.

623
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,987
It is inappropriate
to teach that to young people.

624
00:42:38,388 --> 00:42:39,924
[man speaking Spanish]

625
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:52,069
Well, I know enchilada and taco
and...

626
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,004
[people laughing]

627
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,275
Speciation is not evolution,
because dogs actually always
remain dogs.

628
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:02,046
It's one of the things we've
observed, and cats always remain
cats.

629
00:43:02,112 --> 00:43:03,413
-We've observed that too.
-[crowd applauding]

630
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,016
Oh, and by the way, elephants
always remain elephants.

631
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,852
[people laughing]

632
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,913
[recorded animal calls]

633
00:43:38,015 --> 00:43:40,885
[Nye] This looks like an
apatosaurus, or a something...

634
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,653
[Ham] Yeah, it's a sauropod.
Yeah.

635
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,125
Your claim is that a family
built this enclosure for ancient
sauropods.

636
00:43:48,425 --> 00:43:51,862
-For each kind of land animal.
-And then the sauropods
disappeared.

637
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,732
Oh, lots of animals have
disappeared.

638
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,200
I mean, that's why
we have endangered species--

639
00:43:56,266 --> 00:43:58,302
But it happened in the last
4,000 years?

640
00:43:58,368 --> 00:44:00,037
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

641
00:44:00,838 --> 00:44:04,108
[Ham] Would you allow someone
to teach the possibility

642
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:07,144
that God created them
in the public schools?

643
00:44:07,211 --> 00:44:08,112
-No.
-Okay.

644
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,479
-Not in science class.
-Mm-hmm.

645
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:13,951
In religion class, in history
class, philosophy class.

646
00:44:14,018 --> 00:44:15,753
But that's not science.

647
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,221
But you said your belief was
everything happened by natural
processes,

648
00:44:17,287 --> 00:44:19,957
and they're teaching that
religion in the science class.

649
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:21,125
-Well, you're calling it a
religion. -Yeah, it is.

650
00:44:21,191 --> 00:44:22,426
We're calling it "the process of
science."

651
00:44:22,492 --> 00:44:24,361
-No, but it is a religion.
-So you can teach...

652
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,163
It's a belief.

653
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:29,666
Teach your worldview in a
different class, but not in
science class.

654
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:39,443
[Ham] You must admit, these are
quite exquisite exhibits, right?

655
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,278
They're very troubling.

656
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:44,014
[stammers] But they're
beautifully done, aren't they?

657
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,251
I guess.

658
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:02,266
[Hams voice] And the Earth was
without form and void,

659
00:45:02,332 --> 00:45:03,533
and darkness...

660
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,869
[somber instrumental music
playing]

661
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,845
[Nye on TV] My scientific
colleagues go to places like
Greenland,

662
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:16,446
Arctic, Antarctica,

663
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:19,083
and they drill into the ice.

664
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,552
And we pull out long cylinders
of ice.

665
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:28,458
Certain of these cylinders
have 680,000 layers of ice.

666
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:32,396
The truth is that these layers
in the ice are not annual
layers.

667
00:45:32,462 --> 00:45:35,532
So Bill Nye and others have
pushed the idea of millions of
years

668
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:39,369
while talking about annual rings
in icicles are simply wrong.

669
00:45:44,441 --> 00:45:47,277
So this is the most troubling
thing you do, Mr. Ham.

670
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:48,979
Trying to convince young people

671
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:53,083
that climate change
is not real is very serious,

672
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,852
because they're gonna have to
grow up and deal with it.

673
00:45:54,919 --> 00:45:56,320
[Ham] Actually, climates change
all the time.

674
00:45:56,386 --> 00:45:57,955
Let me rephrase it for you.

675
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:00,958
Human-caused climate change
is very serious.

676
00:46:01,191 --> 00:46:04,161
-Well, there's a lot of debate
about it. -This is the worst
thing you--

677
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:06,330
There's a lot of scientists
who would disagree with that.

678
00:46:06,396 --> 00:46:08,098
-In fact, we--
-Very, very few.

679
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:09,867
We have PhD scientists on our
staff who would disagree with
that.

680
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:11,735
We have PhD scientists.

681
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:15,873
Your scientists on your staff,
as respectful as I can be, are
incompetent.

682
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,453
[Ham's voice] ...contradicts the
secular belief of millions of
years.

683
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,057
[girl] How did God create us?

684
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,493
[Ham] "How did God create us?"
The Bible says He spoke, and it
happened,

685
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,496
because He is all powerful,
because He is infinite creator
God.

686
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:43,800
So, young woman, I would say to
you,

687
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:46,136
that there's a process

688
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:50,407
that humans have developed over
a millennia by which we know
nature.

689
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,641
And we call that "science."

690
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:54,444
The big thing in science
is questioning things.

691
00:46:54,511 --> 00:46:58,949
So, are you telling this little
girl that she is just an animal?

692
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,185
The word "just" I disagree with.

693
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,220
She's a wonderful, beautiful
animal.

694
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,489
I believe Mr. Ham.

695
00:47:05,555 --> 00:47:07,357
-Say that again?
-I believe Mr. Ham.

696
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,960
Okay. So, as you get older,
just look at the world.

697
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:12,096
I really encourage you to go to
college.

698
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:53,237
[Nye] Some of those kids, I
don't think they were in fifth
grade.

699
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,540
You know, when we did the
Science Guy show,

700
00:47:56,606 --> 00:47:59,509
we had very compelling
evidence that ten years old

701
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:03,213
was the oldest you could be to
get the lifelong passion for
science.

702
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,984
We're gonna lose thousands and
thousands of kids from this
area,

703
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,421
who grew up with this weird,
untenable worldview.

704
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:13,523
[people chanting] ...we don't
want your Ark no more!

705
00:48:13,590 --> 00:48:17,161
One, two, three, four,
we don't want your Ark no more!

706
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:20,564
One, two, three, four,
we don't want your Ark no more!

707
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:22,399
[people cheering]

708
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:26,603
Today that grand opening of the
Ark Encounter kicked off about
an hour ago.

709
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:29,173
Across the street, we saw
a lot of people going in there.

710
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,041
Hundreds of people.

711
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:33,443
I want to go talk to Jim Helton,
the president of the Tri-State
Freethinkers.

712
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:34,678
Science is part of it,

713
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:36,180
but you say there's more to it
than just that?

714
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:39,016
Yes. We want to draw attention
to where your money is going to,

715
00:48:39,083 --> 00:48:40,250
and that your children
will be indoctrinated

716
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,152
to say that evolution
and science aren't true.

717
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:46,490
Here's what happened. They
strategically placed Bill Nye at
the Creation Museum.

718
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:52,262
After that debate, they raised
millions of additional dollars
for the Ark Encounter.

719
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,433
Was Bill Nye responsible for
some of that?

720
00:48:57,301 --> 00:48:59,103
Unfortunately, probably yes.

721
00:49:00,904 --> 00:49:04,041
[people chanting] One, two,
three, four, we don't want your
Ark no more!

722
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:07,211
[TV reporter] It's a theme park
of biblical proportion,

723
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:10,580
but until now, the money to make
it has not been flooding in.

724
00:49:10,647 --> 00:49:13,317
But $15 million in the last two
weeks

725
00:49:13,383 --> 00:49:15,619
came from a rather ironic chain
of events.

726
00:49:15,685 --> 00:49:17,654
...who don't understand natural
law...

727
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:20,124
[TV reporter] When thousands
watched science advocate Bill
Nye

728
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,291
debate Ham online,

729
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:23,260
believers pulled out their
wallets.

730
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,810
[Coyne] Nye's mistake was giving
credibility to Ken Ham

731
00:49:40,877 --> 00:49:43,347
by giving him a public platform.

732
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:47,051
Everything I've seen about Nye
is that

733
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,187
he really misses being the
Science Guy,

734
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:52,656
because he was much beloved
and very popular.

735
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:57,194
It's hard to give up celebrity.

736
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:07,371
The starting position for me is,
"What is your goal?"

737
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:11,841
My goal is helping the public
understand

738
00:50:11,908 --> 00:50:15,445
why evolution is good science,
why climate change is good
science,

739
00:50:15,745 --> 00:50:17,081
why they should be taught to
kids.

740
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:19,749
I don't know what Bill's goals
are.

741
00:50:29,859 --> 00:50:34,231
Bill has always wanted to be
famous from the get-go.

742
00:50:34,598 --> 00:50:37,033
He's actually said that to me,
"I wanted to be famous."

743
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,203
He wanted to be a star.

744
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:40,537
I see...

745
00:50:40,604 --> 00:50:41,471
You've seen the pictures
with the drone on the back.

746
00:50:42,972 --> 00:50:44,508
[man] Okay, Bill. I'm rolling,
whenever you're comfortable.

747
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:49,879
Okay. So everyone just give a
big...

748
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:52,782
[Jim McKenna]
The Science Guy is a character,

749
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:57,087
but Bill is a human. He's not
perfect.

750
00:50:57,821 --> 00:51:01,691
See, that's why airplanes take
off and land pointing into the
wind.

751
00:51:03,327 --> 00:51:05,829
[McKenna] So we committed
to a TV show with Bill,

752
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:12,402
but suddenly Bill went to
Portland, and he did a pilot
with our material.

753
00:51:13,537 --> 00:51:17,307
Our show, Bill Nye the Science
Guy, almost did not happen.

754
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:21,211
[TV show theme song playing]

755
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,418
Hey, Bill Nye the Science Guy
here.

756
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:31,555
What I've got is a set-up
for making hydrogen gas.

757
00:51:31,621 --> 00:51:33,457
I have a special chemical in
here that...

758
00:51:33,523 --> 00:51:37,927
If you need any proof that there
was more than just Bill Nye
behind the success

759
00:51:37,994 --> 00:51:41,398
of the Bill Nye the Science Guy
show, all you have to do is look
at the version

760
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:45,469
of the show that was produced
down in Portland, and it was
ridiculous.

761
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:50,707
It was like some form of crazy,
manic Captain Kangaroo.

762
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:54,211
Bill really wasn't at his best,
it didn't make a lot of sense.

763
00:51:54,278 --> 00:51:56,513
It didn't get picked up.
It kind of went nowhere.

764
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:00,384
[loud explosion]

765
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:02,352
Would you look at that?

766
00:52:02,419 --> 00:52:05,822
He's gonna blow up the whole
neighborhood if somebody doesn't
do something.

767
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,224
[glass breaking]

768
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,458
Whoa! [laughs]

769
00:52:10,059 --> 00:52:11,428
[McKenna] We lost him
for a year, contractually.

770
00:52:11,495 --> 00:52:13,797
We were threatened with lawsuits
if we even talked to him,

771
00:52:13,863 --> 00:52:15,899
and I felt pretty raw from that.

772
00:52:15,965 --> 00:52:16,833
[TV static]

773
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:20,737
So, overall, the page and a half
scene is all different
locations,

774
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,939
but we'd like to cut up
sentences.

775
00:52:23,006 --> 00:52:26,610
[laughing] Oh, yeah. Let's go
shoot.

776
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:28,712
We have to go shoot some stuff.
I forgot about that.

777
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,980
-And go to the doctor.
-Yeah, go to the doctor.

778
00:52:31,047 --> 00:52:36,920
I think fame changed Bill, and I
think probably the biggest way
is, um,

779
00:52:38,422 --> 00:52:41,225
his trust issues, and I think
also his vulnerability.

780
00:52:41,291 --> 00:52:42,826
He's very protective of it,

781
00:52:42,892 --> 00:52:44,961
and then now you're not seeing a
Bill

782
00:52:45,028 --> 00:52:48,665
that we grew up with, you know,
20 years ago.

783
00:53:01,911 --> 00:53:05,249
[Heather Berlin] When you
started getting more popular

784
00:53:05,315 --> 00:53:09,719
and your brand of science humor
caught on, and you started
getting recognized,

785
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,322
how did that make you feel?
I mean, were you, you know...

786
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:14,491
[Nye] It makes you feel cool.
It makes you feel appreciated.

787
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:17,927
Yeah. But now you have
millions and millions of people

788
00:53:17,994 --> 00:53:20,564
who know you or your persona.

789
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,701
What does that do to your psyche
and what does it do to your
brain, ultimately?

790
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:30,006
I'm studying the effect of
celebrity and fame on the brain
and the psyche,

791
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:35,645
and Bill is a great test case,
where I can explore my thesis.

792
00:53:35,945 --> 00:53:39,616
I won't be surprised if your
brain, my brain, is meh from all
this.

793
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:41,084
[Berlin] Yeah. I mean,
and that's my theory,

794
00:53:41,150 --> 00:53:45,722
is that being in the limelight
for a given period of time

795
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,892
can affect even the way
your brain is wired up.

796
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:53,297
So, in terms of engaging with
the public, getting approached
by people,

797
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:57,601
is there this constant having to
shield yourself and close your
real self off?

798
00:53:58,134 --> 00:54:01,305
Well, I close off a lot.
I don't know if it's constant.

799
00:54:01,505 --> 00:54:03,807
Do you think that has affected
you in your personal life as
well?

800
00:54:03,873 --> 00:54:05,775
Oh, yeah. Oh, no. Yes!

801
00:54:07,944 --> 00:54:10,714
Do you think you've
sacrificed having a family...

802
00:54:10,780 --> 00:54:13,417
I think about that all the time.
And I just... I never did that.

803
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:16,820
Do you think that you sacrificed
that to pursue this career?

804
00:54:16,886 --> 00:54:20,290
Well, how about this. I chose to
pursue this instead of doing
that.

805
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:22,959
I mean, there were
opportunities...

806
00:54:23,493 --> 00:54:25,595
-Right. -To get married and have
babies, for sure.

807
00:54:25,662 --> 00:54:27,964
But I know people can do both.

808
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:31,034
Well, this it. Dude! Dude.
[laughs]

809
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:36,873
I think women that I've known
are frustrated with me, because
I don't...

810
00:54:39,008 --> 00:54:41,411
I won't commit-commit,
because...

811
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:44,481
[stammers] But I think that's
not to do with fame so much.

812
00:54:44,548 --> 00:54:49,753
My parents stopped getting along
in a very important time in my
development.

813
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:50,687
How old were you?

814
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,790
I don't know. I was 12.

815
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:57,026
-Hmm.
-My mom was very, very unhappy,

816
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:01,598
and my father was extremely
stubborn. And he was...

817
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,969
Bitterly sarcastic.

818
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,405
And I think a lot of that
rubbed off on me,

819
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,075
and that's not good all of the
time. I have angered some
people.

820
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,478
So you have a fear of intimacy,

821
00:55:14,544 --> 00:55:17,381
perhaps related to the fact that
your parents' relationship
failed?

822
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,848
Yeah.

823
00:55:18,915 --> 00:55:21,017
So if you just keep a little bit
of distance, you're always safe.

824
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:25,855
But at the same time, it never
allows you to have a real
full...

825
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:45,642
[McKenna] I think about this
often. I had trust issues with
Bill.

826
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:48,878
But he's got this mission.

827
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,082
I see Bill go on and do great
things,

828
00:55:53,149 --> 00:55:56,853
and I am happy and proud
that he has done this.

829
00:55:58,588 --> 00:56:00,390
And I think it's brave.

830
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:28,485
My dad's big thing was, "Every
man's responsible for his own
actions,"

831
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,421
and "Leave the world
better than you found it."

832
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:37,160
These are Ned Nye's rules of
life right there. Guiding
principles.

833
00:56:43,299 --> 00:56:45,802
My parents participated in this
world war.

834
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:47,937
They contributed to winning it.

835
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:01,050
So, my parents made me who I am.

836
00:57:01,117 --> 00:57:02,786
I mean, for better or for worse.

837
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,854
Uh...

838
00:57:06,690 --> 00:57:09,626
You feel great about it, but I
also feel, like, "Man, I could
do more."

839
00:57:10,293 --> 00:57:12,028
Would they be proud of me,

840
00:57:12,095 --> 00:57:14,531
the mistakes I've made?
Would they go along with it?

841
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:19,836
I try to be worthy of them.

842
00:57:20,169 --> 00:57:22,806
I try to leave a legacy.

843
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,812
My drive to do all of this
is from my parents.

844
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:55,939
[people chattering]

845
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:57,173
[woman] I got it.

846
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,485
The actual reason why I'm
actually here is going well.

847
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,657
[cheering]

848
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,063
Hi, you guys!

849
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:23,066
[all cheering]

850
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:26,502
Don't you people have school to
work on?

851
00:58:26,970 --> 00:58:28,672
[all laughing]

852
00:58:28,738 --> 00:58:30,173
Carry on, carry on!

853
00:58:30,239 --> 00:58:31,140
Oh, my God!

854
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:47,190
There's the spacecraft over
there, and you say, "That's it?"

855
00:58:47,256 --> 00:58:49,258
Yeah, that's it. It's that big.

856
00:58:49,325 --> 00:58:51,595
It's literally smaller
than a loaf of bread.

857
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,608
It really is gorgeous. It's just
gorgeous.

858
00:59:05,842 --> 00:59:08,812
When I was in class, 40 years
ago,

859
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:11,748
Carl Sagan talked about
a solar sail mission.

860
00:59:12,448 --> 00:59:13,783
But it never happened.

861
00:59:16,185 --> 00:59:19,088
So this is realizing a
40-year-old dream,

862
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:22,125
building a spacecraft
that would fly in space,

863
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:23,960
propelled just by light.

864
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:26,863
So, Professor Sagan, this one's
for you.

865
00:59:30,266 --> 00:59:31,267
[indistinct chatter]

866
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,912
[Nye] We're all very hopeful.
This is an important day in
testing the spacecraft,

867
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,683
to turn it on and see if it does
everything it's supposed to do.

868
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,853
The LightSail spacecraft
will go there in the middle.

869
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:54,791
The antenna will spring out,

870
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:57,961
and the sails will deploy,

871
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:00,129
if nothing goes wrong.

872
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,039
[indistinct conversation]

873
01:00:18,181 --> 01:00:20,684
-[man] All right. Are you ready?
-[man 2] Ready.

874
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:21,918
Countdown.

875
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:28,624
[all] Five, four, three, two,
one, zero...

876
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:30,994
[Nye] Oh, man. Right there.

877
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:33,830
Hey, you guys.

878
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:38,334
I'm really glad it works.
Woo-hoo!

879
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,437
Oh, that's great.
That's really great, you guys.

880
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:44,340
It's really nice. It's working
perfectly.

881
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:09,032
[people cheering]

882
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:19,743
[Nye] So the reason we're doing
this is to advance space
science.

883
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:25,081
There's just a few missions
that a solar sail is ideal for.

884
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:29,218
You could monitor the Earth's
climate, sort of, indefinitely,

885
01:01:29,518 --> 01:01:33,923
and that would be a worthy
use of these inexpensive,

886
01:01:33,990 --> 01:01:35,992
lightweight spacecraft.

887
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:48,171
So, next year we're launching
a solar sail into space...

888
01:01:52,942 --> 01:01:55,044
And I'm quite anxious about it.

889
01:01:55,611 --> 01:01:59,148
The Planetary Society launched
a solar sail in 2005,

890
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:01,918
and the result was catastrophic.

891
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:10,827
[Ann] After Carl's death, I was
the program director of Cosmos
I,

892
01:02:10,894 --> 01:02:17,366
which would be the very first
attempt to launch a solar sail
into space.

893
01:02:20,436 --> 01:02:23,506
[Nye] We launched it on a
Russian Cold War ballistic
missile

894
01:02:23,940 --> 01:02:25,341
in the Arctic Ocean.

895
01:02:43,192 --> 01:02:47,096
Everybody was, sort of, gathered
around listening for
information, updates.

896
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:54,770
"Well, we're waiting for a
signal." No. There was no
signal.

897
01:02:56,072 --> 01:03:01,244
[Ann] And word came that our
tracking seemed to indicate that
it was off-course.

898
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,514
[Nye] And it crashed.

899
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,350
[explosion]

900
01:03:07,416 --> 01:03:09,518
And it's in the bottom of the
ocean.

901
01:03:14,523 --> 01:03:20,296
[Ann] And so our attempts to
launch humanity's first solar
sail were thwarted.

902
01:03:26,069 --> 01:03:27,536
[Nye] While we're sitting here,

903
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,373
the spacecraft is sitting
on this laboratory bench,

904
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,076
the antenna deployed.

905
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,378
But then you've got... There's
nothing to do for 40 minutes.

906
01:03:35,444 --> 01:03:40,283
So, in this meantime, Joe
Bastardi,

907
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:43,252
the meteorologist-weightlifter,

908
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:47,056
sent me a direct message on
Twitter.

909
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:50,393
"Hey, Bill. Sorry I blocked you
last week.

910
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:53,429
That really is not me,
as I am a libertarian."

911
01:03:53,662 --> 01:03:59,235
Please welcome, for
meteorologists, the chief
forecaster for Accuweather,

912
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:04,607
NABBA American Bodybuilding Tall
Class Champion, Joe Bastardi.

913
01:04:04,673 --> 01:04:06,375
Joe, thanks so much for coming
on.

914
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:07,610
[audience cheering]

915
01:04:08,912 --> 01:04:12,916
Do you believe that global
warming is man-made?

916
01:04:13,216 --> 01:04:15,151
Global warming is basically
natural.

917
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:17,453
It's a fraud. I don't know if
that's true, and I don't care.

918
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,222
What do you say about that,
Brenda?

919
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:22,691
Well, meteorologists are
focusing on the short-term,

920
01:04:22,758 --> 01:04:24,327
and climate scientists
look at the long-term.

921
01:04:24,393 --> 01:04:26,162
These are, like, natural cycles.

922
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,630
[Stephen Colbert] What's the
long-term?

923
01:04:27,696 --> 01:04:31,100
It just seems so unlikely that a
guy with a degree in meteorology

924
01:04:31,167 --> 01:04:34,337
does not have a grasp
of the greenhouse effect.

925
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:35,871
And it wouldn't matter,

926
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,709
except the deniers have been so
successful in keeping the United
States

927
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:43,446
from becoming a world leader
in addressing climate change.

928
01:04:43,712 --> 01:04:46,349
I agree that there's climate
change, all right?

929
01:04:46,415 --> 01:04:47,850
Do humans have something to do
with it?

930
01:04:47,917 --> 01:04:50,419
They probably have something to
do with it. I don't know what.

931
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:53,322
Is it worth crashing the
American economy? No. I don't
believe that.

932
01:04:54,257 --> 01:04:58,027
[announcer] Please welcome Joe
Bastardi!

933
01:04:58,094 --> 01:04:59,428
[audience cheering]

934
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:10,406
[Joe Bastardi] I just think that
C02 is very, very small,

935
01:05:10,473 --> 01:05:12,541
relative to everything else
that's going on.

936
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:24,187
If the environment was a
workout, to me, the sun would be
squats.

937
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,195
The oceans would be pull-ups.

938
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:43,072
Power cleans would be stochastic
events, like volcanoes.

939
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:52,481
All those things are
the climate control knobs.

940
01:05:52,548 --> 01:05:55,151
All right. So set it slow, set
it fast.

941
01:05:55,451 --> 01:05:57,620
C02 would probably be, you know,

942
01:05:57,686 --> 01:06:00,556
band curls on a Thursday morning
circuit or something.

943
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:08,397
Relative to those big-ticket
exercises,

944
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:10,166
I don't think it's a control
knob.

945
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,477
When they argue the warmer
water that runs into

946
01:06:21,544 --> 01:06:24,547
the Arctic thingamajig that's
cold,

947
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:29,118
they say that that is all global
warming,

948
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:32,021
climate change, whatever. So
what is creating this
phenomenon?

949
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:35,091
Well, what's creating it is the
natural,

950
01:06:35,158 --> 01:06:37,593
cyclical processes that we've
seen for years and years.

951
01:06:37,893 --> 01:06:41,197
In this particular year, because
of our forecast in WeatherBELL,

952
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:43,232
we thought that it's going
to be an in-close year,

953
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,301
high-impact year for the United
States.

954
01:06:45,368 --> 01:06:46,802
[Michael Mann] Climate-change
deniers

955
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:49,538
have this huge megaphone
that has been provided to them

956
01:06:49,605 --> 01:06:53,276
by fossil fuel interests,
by conservative media outlets

957
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:56,745
that are part of this larger
climate-change denial machine.

958
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,348
And so what you've gotta be
concerned about...

959
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:03,152
[Mann] Much of the denial comes
from an ideological viewpoint.

960
01:07:03,219 --> 01:07:07,556
You know, regulating greenhouse
gases must be bad because all
regulation is bad.

961
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:09,825
Well, you do the math and add it
up,

962
01:07:09,892 --> 01:07:12,728
and if you go back and look and
study what happened before,

963
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:14,430
you come up with your answer.

964
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,699
Well, I go to you for those
answers because you're that
good.

965
01:07:16,765 --> 01:07:18,567
Thank you, Joe. I appreciate it.

966
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:19,902
-Get home safe.
-I appreciate it.

967
01:07:19,968 --> 01:07:21,937
Joe Bastardi. All right.
In the meantime, what the frack?

968
01:07:22,004 --> 01:07:26,609
The White House today piling on
more rules when it comes to
fracking on public lands.

969
01:07:26,675 --> 01:07:29,645
That's extracting oil and all
that stuff we need in this
country.

970
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:32,715
Critics say it's just gonna
drive up energy costs for all of
it,

971
01:07:32,781 --> 01:07:34,217
Jay Lehr says, "Enough is
enough."

972
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:40,223
Joe Bastardi has challenged me

973
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:47,230
to "Some questions for Bill Nye,
six years after our O'Reilly
Factor debate."

974
01:07:48,664 --> 01:07:53,369
They think climate deniers are
doing us a disservice these
days, and Bastardi,

975
01:07:53,436 --> 01:07:56,172
at least currently, Joe
Bastardi, is a climate denier.

976
01:07:56,772 --> 01:07:58,574
Joe Bastardi, who is our go-to
guy,

977
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:01,277
he points to a lot of
interesting facts in history.

978
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:04,680
You know, the Dust Bowl in
Oklahoma, the dinosaurs'
extinction.

979
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,651
I like bringing those things up
so people don't believe this is
global warming.

980
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:10,819
And the snow...

981
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:13,622
[Nye] Joe Bastardi is the
meteorologist of record for
conservative media.

982
01:08:14,823 --> 01:08:16,792
Maybe I can nudge him.

983
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:20,663
Show him the importance of
carbon dioxide.

984
01:08:21,264 --> 01:08:22,298
We'll give it a run.

985
01:08:22,965 --> 01:08:24,267
Take you on, Joe.

986
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:30,473
[Garrett Bastardi] That's right
here. Right there. That looks
like that.

987
01:08:30,539 --> 01:08:31,874
[Joe] Yeah, it does, a little
bit like it.

988
01:08:33,276 --> 01:08:34,310
What's going on is you're
cooling the Indian Ocean.

989
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:37,446
That's what the implications are
here.

990
01:08:37,513 --> 01:08:40,716
Ever since I was a very young
child, I was fascinated by the
weather,

991
01:08:41,484 --> 01:08:44,487
and I see it in my son, who is
very interested in the weather.

992
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:47,856
You know, we've just been in the
warm cycle over the last, uh...

993
01:08:47,923 --> 01:08:49,892
-What, 30 years?
-[Joe] Thirty years. So...

994
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:53,762
And the temperature has been a
little warmer the last 30 years.

995
01:08:53,829 --> 01:08:55,298
There seems to be a correlation
there.

996
01:08:55,364 --> 01:08:57,333
Yeah. Well, I see the...

997
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,603
When I found out my dad was
gonna be debating Bill Nye on
The O'Reilly Factor

998
01:09:00,669 --> 01:09:05,574
on Fox News, I was in sixth or
seventh grade, and we had just
finished watching,

999
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:07,276
you know, for the past few
years,

1000
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:09,645
watching Bill Nye the Science
Guy, those videos.

1001
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,316
So he was a celebrity to me, and
a lot of people my age were,
like,

1002
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:14,383
"Please be nice to him."

1003
01:09:14,883 --> 01:09:17,286
Do you agree, Joe, that in 1750

1004
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:21,290
the world's carbon dioxide
was about 280 parts per million?

1005
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:23,492
Do you agree with that?

1006
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:24,893
Bill, you don't want to go here.
You know why? Because I'm
going...

1007
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,096
[Garrett] And it got kind of
testy, a little bit.

1008
01:09:28,163 --> 01:09:31,867
We were, like, "My dad's not
listening to anything we're
saying,

1009
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,569
and they're just kind of going
at it."

1010
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:36,004
So if you want to believe that,
you can go ahead and believe
that.

1011
01:09:36,071 --> 01:09:37,940
-Let Bill reply. Go ahead, Bill.
-Seems kind of hard to.

1012
01:09:38,006 --> 01:09:41,744
[Joe] Before the O'Reilly
debate, Garrett says to me,
"Dad,

1013
01:09:42,478 --> 01:09:45,448
he's like the Easter Bunny and
Santa Claus rolled up into one.

1014
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,250
You can't get mad at him."

1015
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:54,923
In an unusual publication called
The Patriot Post,

1016
01:09:55,123 --> 01:09:58,961
a bodybuilder and meteorologist
named Joe Bastardi challenged
me.

1017
01:09:59,027 --> 01:10:00,896
He challenged me to show a
connection

1018
01:10:00,963 --> 01:10:03,666
between carbon dioxide
and the world's temperature.

1019
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:09,805
I predict that 2016 will be
among the top ten hottest years
ever recorded.

1020
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,375
Mr. Bastardi, I cannot help but
note

1021
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,843
that you've spoken
at the Coal Training Conference,

1022
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,979
Nebraska Propane and the Gas
Forum.

1023
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:20,015
Where you speak is your
business,

1024
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:22,385
but it also seems to be your
business.

1025
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:26,955
Have you ever seen a check
arrive from the Koch brothers
out there?

1026
01:10:27,022 --> 01:10:28,156
[Garrett] No.

1027
01:10:28,223 --> 01:10:30,459
-No? -I've never seen a Koch
brothers check.

1028
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:35,931
Have I made speeches directly
related to climate change? Yes.

1029
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:37,600
Have I been paid for them? Yes.

1030
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,268
Will I do that again? Yes.

1031
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:43,572
But the idea that the oil
companies are paying me,

1032
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:46,609
and that's why I believe what I
believe, is total nonsense.

1033
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:51,314
And if Bill's making money
because he's talking about
climate change, great.

1034
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,448
More power to you.

1035
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:53,682
He says it here.

1036
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:57,853
"Bill Nye is wrong. He's not a
real scientist," right?

1037
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:00,255
That's a big thing with Mr.
Bastardi.

1038
01:11:00,656 --> 01:11:03,592
"Bill Nye's an actor." Wait, I'm
both.

1039
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:07,763
Or, at least I'm an engineer who
took a lot of physics. How about
that?

1040
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,369
[airplane whirring]

1041
01:11:32,555 --> 01:11:34,323
[Nye] I don't have a PhD.

1042
01:11:35,558 --> 01:11:38,126
So, I talk to the experts,

1043
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:41,564
to people in the field who know
all about climate science.

1044
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:50,506
And if I can, I really want to
see the process,

1045
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:53,542
and hold the evidence in my
hands.

1046
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,768
[wind whistling]

1047
01:13:17,826 --> 01:13:20,963
[James White] Wow.
This is where the magic happens.

1048
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,698
This is where the ice core is
drilled.

1049
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:44,052
Ice cores are the best archive
of the past.

1050
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:49,257
They tell us about
what happened on our planet

1051
01:13:49,324 --> 01:13:51,894
tens to hundreds
of thousands of years ago.

1052
01:13:55,598 --> 01:14:00,603
So we just go down at ten-foot
chunks, all the way through the
bottom.

1053
01:14:00,669 --> 01:14:01,837
-Two miles?
-Yeah.

1054
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:11,814
Once this becomes solid ice,
it's still 10% air.

1055
01:14:12,280 --> 01:14:14,617
So we can take that ice core
back to the lab,

1056
01:14:14,817 --> 01:14:17,820
shave it down in a controlled
environment, collect the air

1057
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:19,287
and measure what was in the
atmosphere

1058
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:23,759
10,000 years ago, or 20,000,
or 100 or 200,000 years ago.

1059
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:24,827
And you melt it too, right?

1060
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:32,835
[White] In the 1960s, we
discovered that humans were
indeed causing climate change.

1061
01:14:33,335 --> 01:14:34,737
That was a surprise,

1062
01:14:36,905 --> 01:14:40,108
and we didn't know that our
climate system was capable of
such an angry response.

1063
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:51,219
Snow falls every year and you
get layers and layers of ice,

1064
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:53,255
which are like pages in a book.

1065
01:14:55,423 --> 01:15:00,095
And as we read this book, we
learn more and more about the
story of our planet.

1066
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:07,670
One of the most important
findings that ever came out of
ice cores is that,

1067
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:11,740
when it's warmer, C02 is higher.
When it's colder, C02 is lower.

1068
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:17,245
Our planet, over the last
million years, naturally varied
between

1069
01:15:17,312 --> 01:15:21,149
really cold times, glacial
periods, and warm times.

1070
01:15:21,216 --> 01:15:25,821
And the difference was 100 parts
per million of C02 in the
atmosphere.

1071
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,163
But as we get closer to the
surface,

1072
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:38,066
we start to see traces of human
activity.

1073
01:15:38,934 --> 01:15:43,739
Since the Industrial Revolution,
we have increased C02 from 280
parts per million

1074
01:15:43,806 --> 01:15:48,744
to 400 parts per million, and
the pace of change is going
faster and faster.

1075
01:15:49,444 --> 01:15:52,615
With the amount of C02 in the
atmosphere we have today,

1076
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:55,751
the planet is gonna continue to
warm.

1077
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:01,957
An interesting question I get
asked a lot is, "Do you believe
in climate change?"

1078
01:16:02,324 --> 01:16:05,260
And, um, the question
is interesting to me,

1079
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:08,864
because the word "belief"
implies that there's some choice
involved.

1080
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:13,101
Whether I choose to believe in
God or not, belief in God is a
choice.

1081
01:16:13,168 --> 01:16:18,173
I believe in God, um, but the...
Whether you believe in climate
change,

1082
01:16:18,473 --> 01:16:19,742
it's physics.

1083
01:16:20,075 --> 01:16:21,009
Um...

1084
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,012
Greenhouse gases trap
the Earth's outgoing energy.

1085
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:27,850
That's all they do. That's what
they do. They can't do anything
else.

1086
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:31,119
You can see in this one. See
those--

1087
01:16:31,186 --> 01:16:32,354
-[Nye] Oh, man.
-[James] Those are all years.

1088
01:16:33,822 --> 01:16:36,324
You can actually see here,
years where you had more snow,

1089
01:16:36,391 --> 01:16:37,760
-years where you had less snow.
-[Nye] Absolutely.

1090
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:46,969
So look at this. There's a layer
of, what is that, a volcano?
What is it?

1091
01:16:47,035 --> 01:16:49,638
[White] That's a volcano
about 27,000 years ago.

1092
01:16:50,338 --> 01:16:55,177
[Nye] God. See, it's 15, it
might be 17 years of eruptions.
Is that possible?

1093
01:16:55,243 --> 01:16:56,879
[White] It's very, very
possible.

1094
01:16:57,112 --> 01:16:58,881
[saw whirring]

1095
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,365
[Nye] This is where we see
the smoking gun

1096
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:19,367
for human-caused climate change.

1097
01:17:20,435 --> 01:17:23,672
I just don't see how
anybody like Joe Bastardi

1098
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,342
could come here, look at the way

1099
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,913
the ancient ice is extracted
from the Greenland ice sheet,

1100
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:37,920
and not agree that humans have
put enough greenhouse gas in the
atmosphere

1101
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:40,022
to cause global climate change.

1102
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:07,850
[White] This is raising sea
level.

1103
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:11,820
This is drowning Miami
eventually.

1104
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,492
This is 50,000-year-old water?

1105
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:20,395
On average. It's about probably
40, 50,000 years.

1106
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:50,859
[White] I was here in 1989,
and it did not look like this.

1107
01:18:50,926 --> 01:18:52,094
[Nye] What did it look like?

1108
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,329
[White] It was a much smaller
stream in 1989.

1109
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,697
Oh, you mean the river. Was
the--

1110
01:18:55,764 --> 01:18:58,033
The river. Yeah, no. We would
come and walk down here.

1111
01:18:58,100 --> 01:18:59,902
It was just water there, but it
wasn't...

1112
01:18:59,968 --> 01:19:01,970
-It was a creek, rather than a
river. -Yeah.

1113
01:19:02,037 --> 01:19:03,005
Rather than a river.

1114
01:19:08,176 --> 01:19:12,347
So this is the Russell Glacier,
and it's melting like crazy.

1115
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:25,894
The white ice reflects a lot of
sunlight, but as the ice goes
away...

1116
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:26,829
[loud crash]

1117
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:28,997
[sighs]

1118
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,336
As the glacier does stuff like
that,

1119
01:19:35,904 --> 01:19:40,308
uh, it's exposing bare rock
and is warming even faster.

1120
01:19:42,477 --> 01:19:47,049
It's very troubling.
It's, uh, heartbreaking.

1121
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,585
Humankind has hardly done
anything about this,

1122
01:19:50,652 --> 01:19:53,889
and we've known about the
problem since the 1980s.

1123
01:20:19,614 --> 01:20:21,283
[Nye] Here comes the jet stream.

1124
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,318
-[Michael] Yep, and they form--
-So where's the warming? Right
here?

1125
01:20:23,385 --> 01:20:24,987
The warming is right there.

1126
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:28,090
It's right there, and it isn't
just any old warming.

1127
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:30,492
These are the warmest sea
surface temperatures we've ever
measured there.

1128
01:20:30,558 --> 01:20:31,894
Three degrees Celsius.
We've never seen that before.

1129
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:32,827
[Nye] That's huge!

1130
01:20:34,162 --> 01:20:35,563
[Mann] Bill is going to do this
event

1131
01:20:35,630 --> 01:20:39,067
in my seminar series tomorrow
with Joe Bastardi.

1132
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:45,007
Bill representing the scientific
case for human-caused climate
change,

1133
01:20:45,073 --> 01:20:49,978
and Joe Bastardi, a
climate-change contrarian,
against the science.

1134
01:20:50,045 --> 01:20:52,414
...where it normally isn't,
because you have the upwelling
cold water...

1135
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,249
[Nye] The ultimate thing

1136
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,584
would be to get Joe Bastardi to
change his mind about climate
change.

1137
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:03,058
If I'm on Fox News, they dismiss
me. They don't listen to what I
have to say.

1138
01:21:03,591 --> 01:21:07,395
But if Joe were on there, saying
that he's changed his mind,

1139
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:10,132
that could be very influential.

1140
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,035
And so it's worth a shot.

1141
01:21:23,478 --> 01:21:25,247
[Joe]
It's nice to have you over here.

1142
01:21:25,313 --> 01:21:27,182
-Nice seeing you.
-This looks fabulous.

1143
01:21:28,883 --> 01:21:33,155
Now... If you took all the
carbon dioxide out of the air
today,

1144
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,957
what would happen
to the Earth's temperature?

1145
01:21:35,490 --> 01:21:36,491
It would get very cold.

1146
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:37,859
No, it wouldn't get that cold at
all.

1147
01:21:37,926 --> 01:21:40,695
Are you trying to tell me that
0.04% of the atmosphere,

1148
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:45,067
and that increase is only 0.01%
since you've been a kid, you
think that's--

1149
01:21:45,133 --> 01:21:46,368
It's a 30% increase.

1150
01:21:46,434 --> 01:21:49,071
-A 30% increase against--
-In just three decades.

1151
01:21:49,137 --> 01:21:50,338
That's enormous.

1152
01:21:50,405 --> 01:21:53,976
Against the entire
ocean atmospheric system?

1153
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:57,012
It's minuscule, Bill. It's
minuscule.

1154
01:21:57,079 --> 01:21:59,247
What if you're wrong? What about
Garrett?

1155
01:22:00,248 --> 01:22:05,187
Garrett, do you get mad
sometimes when I actually
concede that it's warmer?

1156
01:22:05,253 --> 01:22:08,756
Yeah. How are we measuring,
you know, accurately,

1157
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:11,126
4,000 years ago or 6,000 years
ago?

1158
01:22:11,193 --> 01:22:13,195
[Nye] Well, 4,000 years we can
do very accurately.

1159
01:22:13,395 --> 01:22:14,829
-[Joe] Okay.
-[Garrett] Okay, so--

1160
01:22:14,896 --> 01:22:16,731
[Joe] We can't do it the way
we're doing it today. Come on.

1161
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:19,034
[Nye] So that's where we
disagree, you guys.

1162
01:22:19,101 --> 01:22:21,403
-[Joe] But you cannot use a tree
ring-- -Dad, Dad...

1163
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:24,072
I know I'm not in this debate. I
just wanted to say something
real quick.

1164
01:22:24,139 --> 01:22:26,474
[Nye] No, you're not in the
debate. No. No, you're over
there.

1165
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,210
I know, I understand.

1166
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,745
I'm arguing with my fifth-grade
childhood hero, so it's pretty
cool.

1167
01:22:30,812 --> 01:22:35,017
The point is, 2016 is warm,
but 2017 is going to be cooler.

1168
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,285
All right, now, if it's not
cooler, I'm obviously in
trouble, right?

1169
01:22:37,352 --> 01:22:41,023
Yeah. Do you guys, do you
understand the significance of
the ice?

1170
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,626
There's nobody running around
with a hypodermic needle
squirting bubbles

1171
01:22:44,692 --> 01:22:46,561
of atmosphere in 4,000-year-old
ice.

1172
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:50,232
I understand that.
I read everything you look at.

1173
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:53,735
The fact of the matter is that
being on the other side of the
issue

1174
01:22:54,436 --> 01:22:56,371
is probably hurting me
economically.

1175
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:59,074
Here's my claim though, Joe.
You're hurting everybody.

1176
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,575
I want you to come around.

1177
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,644
"Hurting"? Who am I hurting?

1178
01:23:02,710 --> 01:23:04,512
Garrett. The future.

1179
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:05,713
I'm not hurting Garrett.

1180
01:23:05,780 --> 01:23:06,914
-That's my claim.
-You don't understand.

1181
01:23:06,981 --> 01:23:09,451
You don't fight. Have you ever
wrestled?

1182
01:23:09,517 --> 01:23:13,655
You wrestle the match
when you're wrestling it.

1183
01:23:13,721 --> 01:23:16,791
You don't sit there and worry
about what the guy's doing in
another bracket

1184
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:20,062
that you might have to wrestle
down the road, and that's the
problem.

1185
01:23:20,128 --> 01:23:23,198
The problem... I'm not trying to
save the world.

1186
01:23:23,431 --> 01:23:27,169
What you're saying is, "Joe,
you've gotta do what I say."

1187
01:23:27,235 --> 01:23:31,473
I say, "Bill, do whatever you
want." So what happens is, you
get this control.

1188
01:23:40,182 --> 01:23:42,384
[Joe] Hey, where's the wine? Do
you want some more wine, Bill?

1189
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:43,318
[Nye] I'm okay.

1190
01:23:44,719 --> 01:23:46,121
So are you gonna come
to Mike Mann's class tomorrow?

1191
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:51,493
You know what? I don't know
that I should do that. If I do--

1192
01:23:51,559 --> 01:23:52,427
[Nye] Well, what's there to
lose?

1193
01:23:54,362 --> 01:23:56,030
-What's there to lose?
-I don't know.

1194
01:24:03,638 --> 01:24:05,640
[indistinct chatter]

1195
01:24:10,345 --> 01:24:12,514
[Nye] These are first-year
students at Penn State.

1196
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:17,752
So I want to get them inspired
about the problem of climate
change,

1197
01:24:17,819 --> 01:24:18,520
and the opportunities.

1198
01:24:21,656 --> 01:24:23,458
And Garrett showed up.

1199
01:24:25,860 --> 01:24:28,596
I think it just shows an
open-mindedness. That's really
good.

1200
01:24:29,531 --> 01:24:32,200
...NASA. The records of global
temperature

1201
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:36,404
based on averages of all the
thermometer information go back
to...

1202
01:24:36,471 --> 01:24:39,674
[Nye] Joe Bastardi sent an email
that said he would not come.

1203
01:24:39,741 --> 01:24:41,109
He's got a chip on his shoulder.

1204
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:46,080
He wants to compete, and here he
would have been outgunned.

1205
01:24:50,652 --> 01:24:52,487
Do I look like someone that's
afraid?

1206
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:54,689
[scoffs]

1207
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:58,360
The Cornell engineer is tougher
than the Penn State wrestler.

1208
01:24:58,426 --> 01:25:00,328
Whatever. Okay?

1209
01:25:00,395 --> 01:25:01,263
I mean, come on.

1210
01:25:02,364 --> 01:25:03,598
Does Bill understand that I
work?

1211
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:07,402
I have X amount of hours
to do X amount of things.

1212
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:12,140
Obviously this is more important
to Bill Nye than it is to me.

1213
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:16,911
If we just got to work, we could
address climate change [snaps
fingers] like that.

1214
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:18,846
I'm very hopeful about the
future.

1215
01:25:19,314 --> 01:25:21,649
Technology has matured.

1216
01:25:21,716 --> 01:25:26,321
There is enough wind and solar
that we could run the US, we
could run the world,

1217
01:25:26,388 --> 01:25:29,624
renewably, right now,
if we just decided to do it.

1218
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:34,196
Maybe I'm wrong.

1219
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,298
[laughs]

1220
01:25:39,467 --> 01:25:41,703
What I've told Garrett is this.

1221
01:25:41,769 --> 01:25:44,306
I may have to see that my son

1222
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:46,808
is writing things and
researching things

1223
01:25:46,874 --> 01:25:49,244
that say, "Dad, you're wrong
about this, okay?"

1224
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:53,548
"I want you to make sure that
you know everybody, all the
facts,

1225
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:57,552
then you can come to your own
conclusion." We've always taught
that in our house.

1226
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,923
Boy, I'll tell you what,
I think of that all the time.

1227
01:26:01,989 --> 01:26:03,825
What if I'm digging that kid a
hole?

1228
01:26:05,293 --> 01:26:06,794
What if he has to pay
for the sins of his father,

1229
01:26:06,861 --> 01:26:09,431
whether his father
is right or wrong, or not?

1230
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:17,171
[Nye] Do we have any questions?

1231
01:26:18,240 --> 01:26:18,673
Yeah. There was a question here
earlier.

1232
01:26:20,675 --> 01:26:23,845
I was wondering if you could
maybe comment on constructive
ways we as scientists

1233
01:26:23,911 --> 01:26:26,748
could reach out and try and
communicate with non-scientists,

1234
01:26:26,814 --> 01:26:31,419
because I feel like climate
deniers have been very good at
capitalizing on, like,

1235
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:32,920
"It's only a theory,"

1236
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:36,391
or this idea that there's always
gonna be some margin of doubt.

1237
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:38,393
So what I would say is,
just keep talking to people.

1238
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:40,795
"Why do you believe that?

1239
01:26:40,862 --> 01:26:43,431
What makes you think that
climate change isn't happening?

1240
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:46,501
What makes you disagree with all
the world's scientists? What is
it?"

1241
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,507
And so, uh...

1242
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:57,412
But I strongly believe that,

1243
01:26:57,479 --> 01:27:00,315
with you all being
the future of the world,

1244
01:27:00,815 --> 01:27:04,586
you will be able to use science
and our process of science.

1245
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:07,021
And the arguments that we can
make,

1246
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:10,024
based on the facts
that we discover in nature,

1247
01:27:10,091 --> 01:27:12,527
and processes in nature...

1248
01:27:49,130 --> 01:27:52,967
Since I was a kid, I'd look up
at the sky.

1249
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:55,970
The stars are out there. This is
our star.

1250
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:01,676
And there's 200 billion stars
in our galaxy,

1251
01:28:01,743 --> 01:28:04,045
and then there are in turn
that many galaxies.

1252
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:05,480
Galaxies!

1253
01:28:08,049 --> 01:28:10,485
It just reminds me of the
importance of space exploration.

1254
01:28:10,552 --> 01:28:13,688
The reason we have these rockets
on the horizon

1255
01:28:13,755 --> 01:28:16,891
is to know our place in the
cosmos.

1256
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:20,528
It's just an extraordinary idea,
and there might be a time

1257
01:28:20,595 --> 01:28:22,697
when we start doing
interplanetary regattas.

1258
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:24,899
See, it's a whole new kind of
idea.

1259
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:31,406
[Nye] Thirty-nine years after
Carl Sagan showed this thing on
The Tonight Show,

1260
01:28:32,039 --> 01:28:36,310
we're gonna launch a solar sail
as part of his legacy.

1261
01:28:39,514 --> 01:28:41,883
It gives me great pause.
It's quite a responsibility.

1262
01:28:51,759 --> 01:28:54,762
Even though we've been launching
for 50-plus years,

1263
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:56,631
rockets are still a tricky
thing.

1264
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:00,334
Every time there's a rocket
firing,

1265
01:29:00,402 --> 01:29:03,104
there could be a catastrophic
explosion right there on the
pad.

1266
01:29:03,705 --> 01:29:05,440
[loud explosion]

1267
01:29:23,491 --> 01:29:25,493
It could start up on this
journey,

1268
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:28,596
and then some stage separation
not work correctly...

1269
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,903
And that's actually what
happened to us when we flew in

1270
01:29:39,073 --> 01:29:41,976
[indistinct announcement over
PA]

1271
01:29:48,249 --> 01:29:51,152
[man over PA] Seventeen seconds
and counting, guidance internal,

1272
01:29:51,218 --> 01:29:56,724
fifteen, fourteen, thirteen,
twelve, eleven, ten, nine...

1273
01:29:58,726 --> 01:30:01,596
Three, two, one...

1274
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:02,797
[loud roaring]

1275
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:04,766
[crowd cheering]

1276
01:30:07,935 --> 01:30:10,171
Now I feel the rush!

1277
01:30:10,237 --> 01:30:11,473
-[crowd cheering]
-Wow!

1278
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,140
-[man over PA] ...past the hour.
-Whoa!

1279
01:30:14,842 --> 01:30:18,012
[Nye] We're going to space. Go,
I said!

1280
01:30:18,846 --> 01:30:23,651
There's chemical reactions
making water vapor. Yes!

1281
01:30:46,841 --> 01:30:49,176
[indistinct radio chatter]

1282
01:30:51,312 --> 01:30:53,581
[man] This is mission resistance
report.

1283
01:30:54,015 --> 01:30:57,451
Indications are that
a signal is being received.

1284
01:30:58,586 --> 01:31:01,689
That would indicate that the
antenna deployed successfully.

1285
01:31:03,324 --> 01:31:04,692
So that's it. We're...

1286
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:05,627
[indistinct]

1287
01:31:08,262 --> 01:31:11,065
Mission Control, it's Bill Nye
in Florida.

1288
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:13,668
Do you hear me?

1289
01:31:15,269 --> 01:31:17,705
[man] Go ahead, Bill Nye.
We receive, five by five.

1290
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:20,742
I would just like
to say the following thing.

1291
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:22,143
Woo-hoo!

1292
01:31:31,118 --> 01:31:32,687
[Ann] Under Bill Nye's
leadership,

1293
01:31:32,754 --> 01:31:38,593
the Planetary Society picked up
this great dream of solar
sailing.

1294
01:31:40,027 --> 01:31:42,196
I'm so proud of Bill.

1295
01:31:42,263 --> 01:31:43,698
[indistinct chatter]

1296
01:31:45,867 --> 01:31:49,637
[Tyson] Bill slowly but
successfully transitioned from
Bill Nye the Science Guy

1297
01:31:49,704 --> 01:31:53,541
for kids, to the science
statesman.

1298
01:31:55,677 --> 01:31:58,145
More power to him. The passing
of a torch.

1299
01:31:58,412 --> 01:32:00,147
We are advancing space science
and exploration.

1300
01:32:00,214 --> 01:32:02,183
We are, dare I say it...

1301
01:32:02,249 --> 01:32:05,086
[all cheering]

1302
01:32:05,152 --> 01:32:06,287
Changing the world!

1303
01:32:06,821 --> 01:32:08,856
[all cheering]

1304
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:15,897
It does not always seem as if
science is in the room when it
needs to be.

1305
01:32:16,430 --> 01:32:21,703
And so, gifted teachers of
science, with a lot of
credibility,

1306
01:32:21,969 --> 01:32:25,707
a sense of humor and ability to
convey complex information,

1307
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:26,974
are needed more than ever.

1308
01:32:27,842 --> 01:32:31,178
And so, Bill Nye, we need about
a thousand more of you.

1309
01:32:31,412 --> 01:32:36,250
Okay, pause. We have a ton of
evidence that Mars used to be
covered in oceans.

1310
01:32:36,718 --> 01:32:40,054
So here today to talk to me
about... Wait, you're not in it
yet.

1311
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:41,222
-Oh.
-Okay.

1312
01:32:42,423 --> 01:32:43,691
I think a lot of people of my
generation

1313
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:47,762
attribute their interest
and love of science to Bill Nye.

1314
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:50,698
What words of inspiration can
you give...

1315
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:53,735
Uh, science is the best idea
humans have ever had.

1316
01:32:54,301 --> 01:32:56,170
You and I drink freshwater.

1317
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:59,140
There were people before him
like Carl Sagan, for example,
but I don't think

1318
01:32:59,206 --> 01:33:01,743
our generation necessarily saw
Cosmos,

1319
01:33:01,809 --> 01:33:03,277
because it was a little
before even our time.

1320
01:33:03,344 --> 01:33:08,082
So Bill Nye was, sort of, the
headline for science for kids,

1321
01:33:09,383 --> 01:33:12,787
and I think that definitely has
spawned this entire generation.

1322
01:33:13,354 --> 01:33:18,626
Although I've never had kids, I
am largely satisfied with my
legacy.

1323
01:33:19,426 --> 01:33:21,362
Yeah, I've made some mistakes.

1324
01:33:23,765 --> 01:33:29,103
But if we have inspired millions
of kids to at least appreciate
science,

1325
01:33:30,337 --> 01:33:32,807
then that's a heck
of a thing to leave behind.

1326
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:37,044
So...

1327
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:41,382
Playing the hand I was dealt,
people. Just trying to change
the world here.

1328
01:34:13,280 --> 01:34:14,749
Greetings.

1329
01:34:17,251 --> 01:34:20,021
[man] His show and just all
the fooling around, it made me

1330
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:25,727
really excited that, you know,
to know that science is not just
this very dull

1331
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:27,228
profession or career,

1332
01:34:27,294 --> 01:34:30,031
that you learn something new,
and that's exciting.

1333
01:34:30,097 --> 01:34:31,265
[Nye] I love you, man.

1334
01:34:31,332 --> 01:34:33,000
I'm also a mechanical engineer.

1335
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:33,935
Oh, cool. Great.

1336
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:35,469
I came here to see Bill Nye,

1337
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:38,773
because he was my inspiration
for being a scientist.

1338
01:34:39,807 --> 01:34:42,043
Bill Nye is the voice for
science and technology,

1339
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:44,245
and I think there's definitely
a need for that.

1340
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:48,983
Science is about dinosaur bones,

1341
01:34:49,050 --> 01:34:52,820
and it studies dinosaur bones,
and I like dinosaur bones.

1342
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,724
-[Nye] Oh, thank you.
-Our class made it.

1343
01:34:57,158 --> 01:34:58,392
Oh, that's really nice.

1344
01:35:01,295 --> 01:35:02,797
Thank you, thank you.

1345
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:06,433
My favorite about Bill Nye...
When I watch him,

1346
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:08,870
he makes me sometimes learn.

1347
01:35:08,936 --> 01:35:11,973
Not many women are in the path
of the scientist,

1348
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:16,043
and he always says that you
should change the world.

1349
01:35:16,343 --> 01:35:20,281
I'm hoping to change the world
by becoming a geneticist

1350
01:35:20,347 --> 01:35:25,152
and stopping all of these
terrible genetic diseases.

1351
01:35:25,219 --> 01:35:26,320
[indistinct conversation]

1352
01:35:28,255 --> 01:35:30,825
When I met him in person, I was,
like, "I want to be Bill Nye
when I grow up."

1353
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:33,027
-[Nye] What a nice shirt, may I
say. -Oh, thank you.

1354
01:35:33,094 --> 01:35:34,295
[Nye] Check it out.

1355
01:35:34,361 --> 01:35:35,229
Hi.

1356
01:35:36,597 --> 01:35:37,799
-Look at the lens over here.
Look! -My bad.

1357
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:40,902
Sweet.

1358
01:35:41,435 --> 01:35:42,369
That is awesome.

1359
01:35:44,371 --> 01:35:47,574
[Joe] The total journey of Bill
Nye is a pretty remarkable
thing,

1360
01:35:47,641 --> 01:35:50,144
because he's involved in
something that I'm fascinated
with, too,

1361
01:35:50,211 --> 01:35:53,180
you know, this whole light sail
project. And, uh... Who knows,

1362
01:35:53,247 --> 01:35:57,084
100 years from now he's the
Thomas Edison of our time, or
something like that.

1363
01:36:00,154 --> 01:36:02,589
[crowd chanting] Bill, Bill,
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill!

1364
01:36:02,656 --> 01:36:05,893
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill,
Bill!

1365
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,495
Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill, Bill,
Bill!

1366
01:36:09,196 --> 01:36:11,432
[Nye] We love that song! Yes!

1367
01:36:12,305 --> 01:37:12,468
