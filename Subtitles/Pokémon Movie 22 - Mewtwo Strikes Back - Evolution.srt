1
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:20,645
[chitters]

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,191
[researcher 1]
The Mythical Pokémon... Mew.

3
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:29,863
[researcher 2] They say it’s extinct,
but there have been reports of sightings.

4
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,577
-Those reports haven’t been confirmed.
-Yes, sir.

5
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,912
There hasn’t even been
a decent photo taken of it.

6
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:39,622
[researcher 2] Unfortunately true.

7
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:47,839
[excavator 1] It’s Mew.

8
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:51,843
Having phenomenal powers
that can cause massive flooding,

9
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,012
or plant life to bloom in the wild,

10
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,681
bestowing some of these powers
on humankind.

11
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,767
[researcher 1] Is it good or evil?

12
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,769
[researcher 2] Is it doing this on a whim?

13
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:06,274
No matter what, one thing is for certain.
It wields great power.

14
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:07,984
[all gasp]

15
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:15,784
[excavator 1]
This is the fossil we just excavated.

16
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,746
-It’s from the body of Mew!
-[excavator 1] That’s our theory.

17
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:23,625
Let’s get this
back to the lab immediately!

18
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,668
If it truly is a Mew fossil...

19
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:29,589
[Dr. Fuji] Then we may be able to recreate
the most powerful of all Pokémon!

20
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,110
[Mewtwo] Where am I?

21
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,405
Who... am I?

22
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,495
Who are you?

23
00:02:10,004 --> 00:02:12,382
I cannot forget the world...

24
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:16,928
where a certain someone flew away from me.

25
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:35,738
Who... am I?

26
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,201
Why am I here?

27
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,371
No.

28
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,373
I am simply here.

29
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,542
That is all.

30
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:52,505
I haven’t emerged into this world.

31
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:05,059
[groaning]

32
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:13,568
[researchers gasp]

33
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,612
-Huh?
-[all gasp]

34
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,823
-[researcher 1 pants]
-[researcher 2 gasps]

35
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:21,618
[researcher 1] It’s finally awakened!

36
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:23,161
Mewtwo!

37
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,329
Mewtwo?

38
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,663
Hm.

39
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:28,124
-Telepathy.
-Ah.

40
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:32,712
Mewtwo. That is your name.
We have given life to you,

41
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:35,632
using the rarest of Pokémon as a basis.

42
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:41,221
Yes. That is the rarest
of the world’s Pokémon, Mew.

43
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:43,056
Mew...

44
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:45,516
Would that be my parent?

45
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,977
My father? My mother?

46
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,732
-Maybe either or maybe neither.
-Huh.

47
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:57,904
[Dr. Fuji] Your existence is based on Mew,
but you were created to be even stronger.

48
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,616
[Mewtwo] Who created me?
Neither father nor mother?

49
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,160
Then nature?

50
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,372
Then, are you saying
that I was created by nature?

51
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,375
In this world,
only two things can create life,

52
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,502
nature and human science.

53
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,506
You did? You humans made me?

54
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,009
-[lab tech 1] It’s a triumph of science!
-[lab tech 2] Proof we were right!

55
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:23,346
[lab tech 3] We can continue our research!

56
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,765
[lab tech 3] We should start
an even better version!

57
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,642
[indistinct chattering]

58
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:29,185
Who am I?

59
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,065
Where am I?

60
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,278
[Dr. Fuji] Congratulations.
I can't believe this.

61
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,866
-[researcher 1] I can't believe we did it.
-[lab tech 1] Congratulations.

62
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,328
[growls]

63
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,622
[all scream and grunt]

64
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:53,293
For what purpose was I created?

65
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,545
[grunts] Huh?

66
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,630
[groans]

67
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:06,681
[groans and growls]

68
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:11,019
[Dr. Fuji] Everyone,
we need to leave immediately!

69
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,729
[lab tech 2] Go, go, go!

70
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,704
[Mewtwo grunts]

71
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,086
[screaming and shouting]

72
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,547
[panting]

73
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,592
Creating the most powerful Pokémon
in the world,

74
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,886
it was our goal and ultimate dream!

75
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:31,265
[Mewtwo] Is this my power?

76
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:35,144
Am I the most powerful Pokémon
in the world?

77
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,649
Mew... am I stronger than you?

78
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:45,988
Hm?

79
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,659
It’s true that you may be
the world’s most powerful Pokémon.

80
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:54,163
But the world has
one other powerful life-form.

81
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,500
Humans.

82
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,132
If you were to join forces with humans,
the world would belong to us.

83
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,426
The world would belong to us.

84
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,514
However, if you were
to simply let your powers loose,

85
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,725
the world’s destruction
would be the only outcome.

86
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:17,228
Your powers must be controlled.

87
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,481
-Controlled?
-Will you let them run wild

88
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,985
and do to the world
the same thing you did to this island?

89
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,487
What must I do?

90
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:48,801
You place armor on me that protects me,
yet holds back my power.

91
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:52,472
After all of this,
what do you expect of me?

92
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:57,602
[Giovanni] It’s simple. You only need
to do what everyone in this world does.

93
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,313
And what is that?

94
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:03,816
Destruction, war and conquest.

95
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,947
The strong will stand victorious.

96
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:24,795
[grunts]

97
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,049
[mooing]

98
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,175
[grunts]

99
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:55,910
[Mewtwo] Where am I?

100
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,332
Who am I?

101
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:11,259
[roaring]

102
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,640
[groaning]

103
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,560
Ah! [grunts]

104
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,398
[growls]

105
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,195
[both roar]

106
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:32,947
[grunts]

107
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,833
For what reason do I fight?

108
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,258
For what reason do I live?

109
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,221
Hmm?

110
00:09:58,514 --> 00:10:00,516
You are a Pokémon.

111
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,269
Pokémon are used for human purposes.

112
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,187
They live for humans’ sake.

113
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,441
Are you telling me to fight for you?

114
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,776
Is that what you mean?

115
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,195
Are you saying I must fight for humans?

116
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,532
You are a Pokémon
that was created by humans.

117
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,951
What other value could you have?

118
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,578
[Mewtwo] Value?

119
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,956
Who am I?

120
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,542
For what reason do I live?

121
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,754
[grunts]

122
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,047
What is this?

123
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,633
You dare to defy humans?

124
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,101
I was created by humans.

125
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,814
But I am not human!

126
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:53,736
And as an artificial Pokémon,
I am not a Pokémon either!

127
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:03,871
[grunts]

128
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,496
Who am I?

129
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,542
Where am I? Who wanted me to be created?

130
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:54,713
Who asked for me to be created?

131
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,384
I despise
everything connected with my creation!

132
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,885
And so...

133
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:04,849
this is neither attack,
nor declaration of war.

134
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,643
You are the ones who created me.

135
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:13,023
And I will strike back... against you!

136
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,405
Pika-Pika!

137
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,201
[panting]

138
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,121
[narrator] This young man
is Ash from Pallet Town.

139
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:12,124
He’s traveling with friends
on a training journey,

140
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:15,377
aiming to become a Pokémon Master.

141
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,590
[Pikachu] Pika!

142
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,095
[all] Wow.

143
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:27,014
-I can smell the sea!
-[squeals]

144
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,432
The view is great here.

145
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,685
-Why don’t we have lunch?
-All right! [giggles]

146
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:34,313
-Man, am I starving.
-Pikachu.

147
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,441
Even after extra helpings
at the Pokémon Center this morning?

148
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,694
-That was breakfast! This is lunch!
-Pika-Pika.

149
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,322
You can’t battle
on an empty stomach, right?

150
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,951
-Eating is part of training.
-Oh yeah! You said it!

151
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,245
-That’s our Brock!
-Pikachu.

152
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,455
Just be sure to help
with setting the table.

153
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,457
-Sure! I’m all over it!
-Pika-Pika!

154
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,169
[Pikachu] Pika-Pika, Pika!

155
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,922
-Pikachu. Pika-Pika.
-[Togepi gibbers]

156
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,257
Pika!

157
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,343
Aw, I’m out of gas!

158
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,637
But, Ash, you know we’re not done!

159
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:10,099
I’m so hungry,
I can’t move another muscle.

160
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:12,977
-Oh, come on!
-Misty?

161
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,522
You have to let it simmer slowly
until it’s just right.

162
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,692
You can’t rush stew,
or Pokémon, for that matter. Hm.

163
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,026
Oh!

164
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:22,611
[laughs]

165
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,282
-Pika-Pika. Pikapi.
-[Togepi gibbers excitedly]

166
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,784
-Pika.
-[Togepi gibbering]

167
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:29,785
Pika-Pika.

168
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,121
Pika?

169
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,751
Pika?

170
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,172
Pi! Pika!

171
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,218
-Pika!
-[all] Huh?

172
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:50,806
[pirate] Hey! You, little boy!
Are you Ash from Pallet Town?

173
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,184
Huh? Yeah, that’s right.

174
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,936
[laughs]

175
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,440
Okay! Does that mean we can have
a Pokémon battle?

176
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,902
Okay!
If somebody wants to battle, why not?

177
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:05,404
What happened to the guy

You’re Nurse Joy, from the harbor poster.

they do look alike.

Wait. Just three of them?

But there were so many more
on the ferry landing.

If a Trainer couldn’t make it here
through the storm,

then they wouldn’t have been invited.

Please release your Pokémon

Okay, how do we get into the palace, eh?

-[Meowth] Please!

523
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:33,527
[Dr. Fuji] However, one clone I made
was different from the rest.

524
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:37,573
From the Mythical Pokémon Mew,
found deep in the jungle,

525
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,492
we discovered the tiniest of fossils.

526
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:44,705
And from that,
I was able to bring forth Mewtwo,

527
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,958
creating the most powerful Pokémon
in the world.

528
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,127
That was our dream.

529
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:53,464
However...

530
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:56,967
[Jessie] Then this...

531
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,220
[James] Is a lab
for creating Pokémon clones?

532
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,932
[Meowth]
Wait, why isn’t there anybody here?

533
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,352
Maybe it’s their day off.

534
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,729
If that’s true, they must need it.

535
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,859
Man...

536
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:17,988
[Mewtwo] At one point,
I thought I’d work alongside humans.

537
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,490
But I was disappointed.

538
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:24,828
Humans are a dangerous species,
inferior even to Pokémon.

539
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:29,917
If cruel, weak humans
are allowed to govern the planet,

540
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,461
the world is headed for ruin.

541
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:35,881
Who will rule the world?
I suppose a Pokémon like you?

542
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:38,133
Pokémon are unfit as well.

543
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,970
After all, they allowed humans to rule
in the first place.

544
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:47,184
For some Pokémon, the purpose
of their lives is to serve humans.

545
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,561
Pikachu! Pikachu!

546
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:53,565
What’s this?
You say you do not serve this human?

547
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,944
That you are with him
because you like this Trainer?

548
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,153
Pika!

549
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,489
You are as pathetic as the rest.

550
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,742
Pika...

551
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,453
-[Pikachu shrieks]
-[Ash grunts and yells]

552
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:09,998
[both grunt]

553
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,043
-[Ash exhales]
-Pikachu...

554
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,295
-Pikachu?
-Pikachu!

555
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,298
Weak Pokémon nestle under a human’s wing.

556
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:23,429
-[Misty] Ash! Are you all right?
-Yeah.

557
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:25,514
How dare you do that to Pikachu!

558
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,057
No matter the Pokémon,

559
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:30,144
there shouldn’t be any Pokémon
that can’t be caught!

560
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:35,399
-Go! Rhyhorn, I choose you!
-[Rhyhorn grunts]

561
00:45:41,447 --> 00:45:42,531
[gasps]

562
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,704
[banging and clanking]

563
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,790
[groans]

564
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:56,086
-[Corey] Rhyhorn!
-Wigglytuff.

565
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,005
A waste of time.

566
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:02,593
Since my creation, I’ve been far stronger
than any Pokémon alive!

567
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,512
You sure? You never know until you try!

568
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:07,306
[Pikachu] Pika.

569
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:08,724
[Mewtwo chuckles]

570
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,561
You want to try?

571
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,316
[all gasp]

572
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,995
-[all gasping]
-[Meowth] I’m not liking this at all.

573
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,835
[all gasp]

574
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:41,507
[all gasping and coughing]

575
00:46:44,009 --> 00:46:46,428
Blastoise Clone.

576
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:52,976
[grunts]

577
00:46:58,357 --> 00:47:00,067
Venu.

578
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,908
[growls]

579
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:25,259
-Mew. Mew. Mew. Mew!
-[Team Rocket gasp]

580
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,847
-[James] What was that?
-[Meowth] Beats me.

581
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,308
[Jessie] It said "mew".

582
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:37,229
Venusaur.

583
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:41,108
[Mewtwo] Humans aspiring
to become Pokémon Trainers,

584
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,903
first choose from three Pokémon
anyone can get.

585
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,532
Bulbasaur, Squirtle and Charmander.

586
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,660
These before you are their evolved forms.

587
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:55,330
-They are my copies.
-Copies? Huh?

588
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,709
[all gasping]

589
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,437
-A battle arena!
-Are we being challenged to a battle?

590
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,190
I choose to battle
with Bruteroot the Venusaur!

591
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,734
Venusaur.

592
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,112
And my partner? I choose Shellshocker!

593
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:28,739
Blastoise.

594
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:32,117
Me, too! Charizard, I choose you!

595
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:42,502
[yawns and grunts]

596
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,596
[roars]

597
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:59,394
-Charizard! I didn't say start.
-Pika. Pika.

598
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:12,074
Your Charizard is poorly trained.

599
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:14,117
[grunts]

600
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:18,705
[grunts angrily]

601
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,934
Which of you will oppose me first?

602
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:42,896
I underestimated you once,
but that won’t happen again!

603
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,773
Saur!

604
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,860
Venu.

605
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:02,124
Go, Bruteroot! Use Razor Leaf!

606
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,126
[roar]

607
00:50:04,209 --> 00:50:05,752
Use Vine Whip.

608
00:50:05,836 --> 00:50:07,295
[roars]

609
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,802
Venusaur!

610
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,512
[gasps]

611
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,472
[grunts]

612
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,352
Venusaur.

613
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,730
Venusaur!

614
00:50:24,813 --> 00:50:26,231
Use Energy Ball!

615
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:31,528
Saur!

616
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:34,823
Yes!

617
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:40,120
Venusaur.

618
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:41,621
Oh!

619
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,665
Use Leaf Storm.

620
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:48,086
Venusaur!

621
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:51,882
Sau-saur!

622
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:52,924
[gasps]

623
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,181
Venusaur.

624
00:50:59,264 --> 00:51:02,142
[gasps and pants] Bruteroot!

625
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,479
Are you okay?

626
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,439
I’m battling you now!

627
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:10,358
Go, Shellshocker! Use Skull Bash!

628
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:13,612
-Blastoise!
-[Mewtwo] Use Skull Bash.

629
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:15,739
Blastoise!

630
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,618
Blastoise!

631
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,415
Shellshocker, use Hydro Pump!

632
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,293
Blastoise!

633
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,138
Shellshocker!

634
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,181
Blast...

635
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:46,019
Ash, be careful!
Their moves are really strong!

636
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:48,522
Yeah, I know! But don’t worry.

637
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,608
None of those attacks can hurt you
as long as they don’t hit you!

638
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:53,902
-[grunts]
-Hm.

639
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,114
[roars]

640
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,493

[growls]

642
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:07,958
-Okay, Charizard! Win it with speed!
-[Charizard growls]

643
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:11,211

[growling and grunting]

647
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:40,615
-How are you going to win it with speed?
-Ugh. They’re too fast.

648
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,325
Pika! Pika!

649
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,499
[roars]

650

653
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,499
Charizard!

654
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,501
Use Seismic Toss.

655
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:39,549
[roaring]

656
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:44,512

[groans]

658
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:01,112
-Charizard! [pants]
-[Pikachu] Pika!

659
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:07,953
It seems you lack both speed and power.

660
00:54:13,416 --> 00:54:15,669
-Huh?
-[Pikachu] Pika?

661
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:20,048
-[Ash gasps and grunts]
-Pi. Pi. Pika!

663
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:26,846
Shellshocker!

664
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,309
Venusaur.

665
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,311
[grunts and pants]

666
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:36,272
-Bruteroot!
-Are you trying to steal our Pokémon?

667
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,149
Steal? No.

668
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:41,319
I am only making
more useful, stronger clones

669
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:44,280
from these Pokémon,
of which you are so proud.

670
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,617
-[gasps]
-Making clones?

671
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:52,664
-Stop it! You can’t do that!
-Do not attempt to defy me!

672

[both groan]

674
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,424
I make my own rules!

675
00:55:02,507 --> 00:55:04,926
-Here they come!
-Run, everybody!

676
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,639

00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:25,697
Gyarados!

681
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,036
Seadra!

00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,782
Pika. Pi. Pi. Pikachu!

691
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:13,703
Pidgeot! [shrieks]

692
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,882
We’ve just got to get them
into their Poké Balls!

693
00:56:25,965 --> 00:56:27,175
A waste of time.

694
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:30,929
-Bulbasaur, Squirtle, return!
-Bulbasaur.

695
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:33,723
Got 'em!

696
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,017
[gasps and grunts]

697
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,020
That’s not possible.

698
00:56:39,312 --> 00:56:42,774
Anything is possible
with the Poké Balls I make!

699
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:45,527
-[Misty] Be very quiet in there.
-Togepi.

700
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,072
[pants softly]

701
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:59,207
Psyduck!

702
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:00,959
No! Psyduck!

703
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,044
Psyduck...

704
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:06,548
[Brock and Nurse Joy pant]

705
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,510
Vulpix.

706
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,389
-Vulpix! No!
-[Nurse Joy gasps]

707
00:57:14,472 --> 00:57:18,393
Pika. Pika. Pikachu.

708
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:23,731
-Pika. Pika!
-[Ash groaning]

709
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:27,318
-Pikachu, run away.
-Pikachu!

710
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,699
-Run!
-Pi. Pi. Pikachu.

711
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:38,872
Pi. Pika. Pi. Pi. Pi. Pikachu.

712
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:44,711
Pi. Pi. Pi...

713
00:57:46,212 --> 00:57:50,300
Pikachu!

714
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,595
Pi. Pi. Pi...

715
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:56,097
Don’t let them get you! Pikachu!

716
00:57:56,181 --> 00:58:00,435
Pi. Pi. Pikachu!

717
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,938
Pikachu!

718
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:08,735

00:58:16,618 --> 00:58:19,704
Oh! [groans and yells]

[gasps and grunts]

722
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:36,513
Pika. Pikachu!

723
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:44,896
Pika. Pi. Pika. Pikachu.

[Pikachu screams]

727
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:57,700
Pika!

728
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:13,716
[gasps and pants]

00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,516
[gasps and pants]

730
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,312
[yells] Ah! Pikachu!

731
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,788
[Jessie and James] Who's that Pokémon?

732
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,790
It’s Scyther!

733
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:49,085
It’s Dewgong!

734
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,131
It’s Vileplume!

735
00:59:56,301 --> 01:00:01,472
[Meowth] Sandslash. Nidoqueen. Vaporeon.

736
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:06,519
And then of course, this one’s Meowth.

737
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:10,773
-[Ash groans] Ow!
-[both] Huh?

738
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:13,276
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

739
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,944
[both] It’s the Twerp!

740
01:00:15,361 --> 01:00:20,450
[gasps] Team Rocket! [pants and grunts]

741
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,702
I don’t have time
for your dumb motto today!

742
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:24,329
-Wait!
-Hey!

743
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,126
[Jessie and James] Who’s that Pokémon?

744
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,919
It’s Pikachu.

745
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:37,258
[groans and screams]

746
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:47,935
[whimpering]

747
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:55,234
[groaning]

748
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,530
[yells and groans]

749
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,787
-Pika.
-Pikachu.

750
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:07,747
Pika. Pi.

751
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:11,000
Pi. Pika.

752
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,003
Pikachu!

753
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:22,053
[Jessie and James]
Whoa! Look at all the copies.

754
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,283
[meows]

755
01:01:47,453 --> 01:01:48,287
Golduck.

756
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:56,129
-Hitmonlee.
-Scyther.

757
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:59,882
-There’s no stopping them.
-Send in the clones.

758
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:03,219
-Those are... clones?
-Pika?

759
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,277
Vaporeon.

760
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,904
Huh? The originals too?

761
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:26,492
[exclaiming]

762
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,745
[all] Stay out of my space!

763
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:36,753
Squirtle!

764
01:02:36,836 --> 01:02:39,505
-Squirtle!
-Pika! Pika!

-Bulbasaur!
-Pikachu! Pika!

768
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:55,605
-Squirtle.

-Pika.
-Squirtle. Squirtle.

01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,867
[grunts in determination]

772
01:03:33,643 --> 01:03:37,522
Humans, I have no desire
to cause you harm.

773
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:40,107
Simply go home now!

774
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:41,692
[all] Huh?

775
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,654
[wind howls]

776
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,283
That is, if you can make it home
through the storm.

777
01:03:49,367 --> 01:03:50,535
[grunting]

778
01:03:58,125 --> 01:03:59,168
What was that?

779
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:06,050
[all grunt and gibber]

780
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:38,291
[Ash] You can’t do this.

781
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:40,001
I won’t let you!

782
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,714
-It’s Ash!
-All right!

783
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:51,721
[roars]

784
01:04:55,224 --> 01:04:56,851
Psyduck.

785
01:04:57,643 --> 01:05:00,062
-It’s Psyduck!
-Vulpix!

786
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:12,909
Squirtle.

787
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:17,496
[grunts in determination]

788
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,081
You set them free?

789
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,584
That’s right. I had to.

790
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,878
I’ll protect all my friends!

791
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:28,174
[grunts and yells]

792
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,218

01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:33,262
[grunts]

794
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,642
-Ash, oh, no!
-Stop it now!

795
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:40,519
[Ash screams]

796
01:05:42,146 --> 01:05:45,858
[grunts and gasps]

797
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,318
What is this?

798
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:49,737
Mew. Mew.

799
01:05:49,820 --> 01:05:52,823
-Huh?
-Mew. Mew. Mew!

800
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,034
[Ash yells and groans]

801
01:05:55,618 --> 01:05:56,744
Mew.

802
01:05:57,995 --> 01:05:59,538
Mew.

803
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,124
-Mew.
-Huh?

804
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:05,920
Mew. Mew. Mew!

805
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,467
-Is that...?
-A Pokémon?

806
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:13,427
Mew...

807
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:15,137
Mew!

808
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:21,811
[meows playfully]

809
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:38,577
Mew.

810
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,123
Mew.

811
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,920
Mew. Mew!

812
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,839
I’ve read about that one.

813
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,049
Right. It’s the Mythical Pokémon.

814
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:55,511
[Mewtwo] Mew,
said to be the only one of its kind

815
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:58,347
and the strongest Pokémon alive.

816
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,640
Mew?

817
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,434
-So, it does exist.
-Yes.

818
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:04,687
[Mewtwo]
However, I am the strongest Pokémon!

819
01:07:05,604 --> 01:07:07,898
I may have been made from part of you.

820
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:12,236
But now I will prove
that Mewtwo is better than the original,

821
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:13,946
superior to Mew!

822
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:15,698
Mew.

823
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,117
Mew and Mewtwo...

824
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:20,453
Then Mewtwo was made from Mew.

825
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:22,705
-Pika.
-Squirtle.

826
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,125
This world is too small for two of us!

827
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:36,469
Why do you flee from me?

828
01:07:36,552 --> 01:07:39,472
Are you afraid to find out
which of us is greater?

829
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,098
[meows]

830
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,734
[grunts]

831
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,152
[Mew meows]

832
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:58,908
[meows]

833
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,125
[meows]

834
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:10,628
[grunts]

835
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,422
-[Mew gasps]
-[Ash gasps]

836
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,174
[Ash gasps]

837
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:20,179
[all gasp]

838
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,640
-Saur.
-Hm!

839
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:31,190
[meows]

840
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,488
[Mewtwo]
So you do have some fight in you.

841
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:44,662
But I have no time for games.
Destiny is at hand!

842
01:08:44,745 --> 01:08:47,373
Who will rule? My super Pokémon?

843
01:08:47,456 --> 01:08:50,960
Or your pathetic group
of inferior Pokémon?

844
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:56,507
We were created with powers far stronger
than the originals!

845
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:59,510
[Mew meows excitedly]

846
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:05,182
-Hm, it’s talking truth.
-Translation?

847
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:10,896
[Meowth] Mew says you don’t prove anything
by showing off a lot of fancy moves.

848
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:14,400
The Pokémon’s real strength
comes from the heart!

849
01:09:15,776 --> 01:09:18,445
A Pokémon’s real strength, you say?
[grunts]

850
01:09:20,406 --> 01:09:25,619
[yells and grunts]

851
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:30,040
Very well! My clones
don’t need moves to prove their worth!

852
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:33,794
Now we shall see who triumphs!

853
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,880
[roaring]

854
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:38,591
[all clamoring and gibbering]

855
01:09:41,468 --> 01:09:47,474
[grunts and pant]

856
01:09:55,191 --> 01:09:56,609
[gasps]

857
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:59,695
[all gibbering]

858
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,351
[Pidgeotto shrieks]

859
01:10:31,518 --> 01:10:35,522
[shrieking and gibbering]

860
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,529
[Ash grunts]

861
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,419
[Psyduck grunts]

862
01:11:06,220 --> 01:11:07,054
Pika...

863
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:10,266
[Dewgong groans]

864
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:11,850
Pika...

865
01:11:13,143 --> 01:11:15,938
Pi... Pika?

866
01:11:17,648 --> 01:11:20,567
[Pikachu clone growls]

867
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,570
Pika...

868
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:36,959
[Ash pants]

869
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,131
[grunts]

870
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,472
[Pikachu grunts and pants]

871
01:11:50,556 --> 01:11:51,557
Pi!

872
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,018
[Pikachu groans and pants]

873
01:11:55,519 --> 01:11:56,687
Pika!

874
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:45,152
What good is this fighting?

875
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:49,031
They’re either originals or copies!

876
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,783
But they’re all alive!

877
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:52,701
This is wrong.

878
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:57,081
Even if they’re copies,
they’re all living in the same world.

879
01:12:57,164 --> 01:13:01,502
Originals and copies.
They’re all living creatures!

880
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,962
Does winning or losing really matter?

881
01:13:06,340 --> 01:13:10,552
[James] We tell others to prepare for
trouble, but I’m not prepared for this.

882
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:13,305
It troubles my heart
to see them all this way.

883
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:16,225
It seems like
they’re only hurting themselves.

884
01:13:16,308 --> 01:13:21,688
-It’s like seeing your old self...
-Battling with your present self.

885
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:25,526
A blast-off bad dream!

886
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:27,694
[sighs]

887
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:30,656
Huh? [shrieks]

888
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:34,076
-[clone howls and hisses]
-[Meowth growls]

889
01:13:35,119 --> 01:13:37,246
I’ll bet these claws hurt.

890
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:40,416
[Meowth clone meows softly]

891
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,917
[Meowth sighs]

892
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:46,380
You’ve got a lot of nerve
being here, you know?

893
01:13:46,463 --> 01:13:48,465
The rest are duking it out!

894
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:51,969
[meows]

895
01:13:52,052 --> 01:13:55,431
Eh? You’re telling me
I’ve got even more nerve?

896
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:57,641
Just 'cause I’m not duking it out?

897
01:13:58,392 --> 01:13:59,560
[meows]

898
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:02,938
Oh, so you think my claws
would hurt a lot, too.

899
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,523
[meows]

900
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:07,776
Well, your claws
would hurt a lot more, you know.

901
01:14:08,652 --> 01:14:10,571
[meows]

902
01:14:11,738 --> 01:14:14,741
[Meowth] You want to know
if tonight’s gonna be a full moon?

903
01:14:14,825 --> 01:14:18,662
Yup. I think tonight is gonna be
a full moon, filled to the top!

904
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:19,746
[meows]

905
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:23,167
[Meowth] Wow. Thinking of the moon
at a time like this...

906
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,211
You know, palley, you’ve got class.

907
01:14:26,295 --> 01:14:27,588
[meows]

908
01:14:39,266 --> 01:14:45,731
Pika! [pants]

909
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,443
-Pika! Pika! Pikachu!
-[gasping]

910
01:14:51,361 --> 01:14:53,697
Pika-Pika?

911
01:14:56,658 --> 01:15:00,329
[gasps] Pikachu!

912
01:15:00,412 --> 01:15:03,415

916
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:30,651
-Pika!
-Pika-Pika!

917
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:33,070
Pikachu!

918
01:15:33,153 --> 01:15:34,321
Pika!

919
01:15:35,072 --> 01:15:40,452
[groans] Pi, Pikachu, Pi, Pika...

920
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:44,248
Pika... [grunts]

[both pant]

924
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,688
Stop, please! Knock it off!

925
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:10,023
[grunts]

926
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,859
-[Brock] Ash!
-[Misty] Ash!

927
01:16:12,943 --> 01:16:15,529
[pants] I’ve got to stop this!

928
01:16:15,612 --> 01:16:16,822
You can’t.

929
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:20,617
Until Mew and Mewtwo stop,
the fighting goes on.

930
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:30,043
Living things won’t give up
their territory

931
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,462
to other members of their own species.

932
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:34,298
That means...

933
01:16:34,381 --> 01:16:38,385
They’ll battle until one is defeated...
till only one remains!

934
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:40,387
[grunting]

935
01:16:41,221 --> 01:16:42,973
That’s how living things are?

936
01:16:43,056 --> 01:16:45,851
But Mewtwo was created by humans.

937
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,520
And yet, it’s a living thing.

938
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:52,858
They’re alive, all right.
Both Mew and Mewtwo.

939
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,359
And Pikachu!

940
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:56,612
And the other Pikachu too!

[pants and grunts]

951
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:19,319
Will you guys stop?

952
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:23,907
Knock it off!

953
01:18:33,458 --> 01:18:36,002
-What’s going on?
-What happened?

954
01:18:37,212 --> 01:18:38,505
Pika...

955
01:18:48,849 --> 01:18:53,437
Foolishness! A human
would actually attempt to stop our battle?

[Pikachu pants]

957
01:19:01,361 --> 01:19:04,322

Oh, no, Ash...

Pika-Pi?

969
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:43,820
Pika?

1014
01:25:05,016 --> 01:25:11,439
It is true that both you and I
are living beings... Pokémon.

1015
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,565
[meows]

1016
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:21,574
I see now that the circumstances
of one’s birth are irrelevant.

1017
01:25:22,242 --> 01:25:27,288
It is what you do with the gift of life
that determines who you are.

1018
01:25:29,749 --> 01:25:30,750
Squirtle?

1019

Huh?

1022
01:26:46,659 --> 01:26:48,453
Pika!

1023
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:50,955
[Togepi squeals]

1024
01:26:51,414 --> 01:26:53,791
Mewtwo, where will you go?

1025
01:26:55,001 --> 01:26:58,838
Where my heart can learn
what yours knows so well.

1026
01:26:59,297 --> 01:27:02,258
What transpired here,
I will always remember.

1027
01:27:02,342 --> 01:27:05,887
But perhaps for you,
these events are best forgotten.

1028
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,286
-Pika.
-[Ash] Huh?

1029
01:27:30,745 --> 01:27:35,124
-Huh? Whoa. Whoa.
-Pika!

1030
01:27:37,210 --> 01:27:39,295
[Ash] Oh. Oh!

1031
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:44,759
Oh!

1032
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:04,112
Please, quiet, everyone!
No boats will leave the harbor!

1033
01:28:04,195 --> 01:28:07,240
This hurricane is stronger
than any seen here before.

1034
01:28:07,615 --> 01:28:09,200
You must evacuate!

1035
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:11,286
Aw, why right now?

1036
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:14,122
Please remain calm
and I’ll do my best to help.

1037
01:28:14,205 --> 01:28:18,209
The Pokémon Center will function
as a shelter, open to anyone!

1038
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,670
Come with me, if you wish to use it.

1039
01:28:33,182 --> 01:28:36,811
Nurse Joy, Officer Jenny, Miranda, too!

1040
01:28:36,894 --> 01:28:40,189
The rainwater
hardly blurs their radiant beauty!

1041
01:28:41,524 --> 01:28:44,277
Huh? Why are we here in the first place?

1042
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:46,154
It doesn’t make any sense.

1043
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:49,032
Well, since we’re already here, who cares?

1044
01:28:49,115 --> 01:28:50,950
-Togepi!
-[laughter]

1045
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:53,953
-Yeah. Right!
-Pika!

1046
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:56,080
-[Brock and Misty] Hm?
Pika?

1047
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:07,258
[all gasp in awe]

1048
01:29:16,684 --> 01:29:18,436
Like it never happened!

1049
01:29:18,519 --> 01:29:22,398
-No hurricane...
-It disappeared!

1050
01:29:23,149 --> 01:29:27,320
-The ships can sail first thing tomorrow.
-Right.

1051
01:29:38,247 --> 01:29:42,752
-Oh, what’s that?
-What’s what?

1052
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:47,715
-You see that? Just up there!
-Pika?

1053
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:50,051
I didn’t see anything at all.

1054
01:29:50,134 --> 01:29:52,053
Nothing but clouds.

1055
01:29:52,136 --> 01:29:53,846
[gasps]

1056
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:02,063
[Ash] On the day I set out
and decided to become a Pokémon Master,

1057
01:30:02,146 --> 01:30:05,525
I saw a really rare Pokémon,
just like I did now.

1058
01:30:05,817 --> 01:30:09,278
Well, then maybe you’ll see
that one again sometime.

1059
01:30:09,362 --> 01:30:12,115
-Huh?
-That really rare Pokémon!

1060
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:14,033
[Ash laughs]

1061
01:30:14,117 --> 01:30:16,160
-Pika!
-[sighs]

1062
01:30:18,996 --> 01:30:21,833
Mm. One day, for sure!

1063
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:24,001
