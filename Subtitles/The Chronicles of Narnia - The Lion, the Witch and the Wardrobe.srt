People do it when they meet each other.

161

[Laughs]

162
00:17:31,182 --> 00:17:36,484
Well, then, Lucy Pevensie
from the shining city of War Drobe

163
00:17:36,554 --> 00:17:39,489
in the wondrous land of Spare Oom,

164
00:17:39,557 --> 00:17:44,358
how would it be if you came
and had tea with me?

165
00:17:44,428 --> 00:17:47,192
Well, thank you very much, but I...

166
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,898
I probably should be getting back.

167
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:55,598
It's only just around the corner.
And there'll be a glorious fire

168
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:59,165
with toast and tea and cakes.

169
00:17:59,243 --> 00:18:02,735
And, perhaps, we'll even
break into the sardines.

170
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:07,015
- I don't know.
- Come on.

171
00:18:07,084 --> 00:18:10,247
It's not every day
that I get to make a new friend.

172
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:15,759
Well, I suppose I could come
for a little while.

173
00:18:15,826 --> 00:18:17,225
If you have sardines.

174
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:20,025
By the bucketload.

- You all right?
- Mm-hm.

178
00:18:41,652 --> 00:18:43,176
Well, here we are.

179
00:18:43,254 --> 00:18:45,484
[Chuckles] Come along.

180
00:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,792
- After you.
- [Lucy] May I help you with that?

181
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:56,662
- Thank you very much.
- Oh.

182
00:19:02,907 --> 00:19:04,932
[Stamping feet]

183
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,977
Oh.

184
00:19:12,616 --> 00:19:13,810
[Tumnus laughs]

185
00:19:13,884 --> 00:19:16,114
Now, that... that is my father.

186
00:19:17,354 --> 00:19:19,515
He has a nice face.

187
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:21,747
He looks a lot like you.

188
00:19:23,194 --> 00:19:24,923
No.

189
00:19:24,995 --> 00:19:27,930
No, I'm not very much
like him at all, really.

190
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:31,434
My father's fighting in the war.

191
00:19:33,037 --> 00:19:36,302
My father went away to war too.

192
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:40,236
But that was a long, long time ago.

193
00:19:40,678 --> 00:19:44,546
- Before this dreadful winter.
- Winter's not all bad.

194
00:19:44,615 --> 00:19:49,143
There's ice skating and snowball fights.

195
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,122
- Oh! And Christmas!
- Not here.

196
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:58,150
No. No, we haven't had a Christmas
in a hundred years.

197
00:19:58,229 --> 00:20:01,995
What? No presents for a hundred years?

198
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:04,534
Always winter, never Christmas.

199
00:20:04,602 --> 00:20:07,503
It's been a long winter.

200
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:11,697
But you would have loved Narnia
in summer.

201
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:16,072
We fauns danced
with the dryads all night,

202
00:20:16,147 --> 00:20:20,106
and, you know, we never got tired.

203
00:20:20,184 --> 00:20:25,144
And music. Oh, such music!

204
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:29,626
Would... would you
like to hear some now?

205
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:33,258
Oh! Yes, please.

206
00:20:37,134 --> 00:20:40,535
Now, are you familiar

207
00:20:40,604 --> 00:20:44,506
- with any Narnian lullabies?
- Sorry, no.

208
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:46,736
Well, that's good.

209
00:20:46,977 --> 00:20:51,937
Because this... probably
won't sound anything like one.

210
00:20:52,016 --> 00:20:54,450

[Wind blowing]

217
00:22:16,934 --> 00:22:19,528
- Oh, I should go.
- It's too late for that now.

218
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:23,639
I'm such a terrible faun.

219
00:22:27,011 --> 00:22:29,343
Oh, no.

220
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,177
You're the nicest faun I've ever met.

221
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:35,844
Then I'm afraid you've had
a very poor sampling.

222
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:40,448
No. You can't have done
anything that bad.

223
00:22:42,393 --> 00:22:46,659
It's not something I have done,
Lucy Pevensie.

224
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:49,358
It's something I am doing.

225
00:22:49,433 --> 00:22:51,162
What are you doing?

226
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:55,565
- I'm kidnapping you.
- [Gasps]

227
00:22:55,639 --> 00:22:57,368
It was the White Witch.

228
00:22:57,441 --> 00:22:59,966
She's the one who makes it
always winter, always cold.

229
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,602
She gave orders.

230
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,012
If any of us ever find a human
wandering in the woods,

231
00:23:05,082 --> 00:23:07,448
we're supposed to turn it over to her.

232
00:23:08,218 --> 00:23:11,119
But, Mr. Tumnus, you wouldn't.

233
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,188
I thought you were my friend.

234
00:23:23,033 --> 00:23:26,594
- Now. She may already know you're here.
- [Grunting]

235
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:29,366
The woods are full of her spies.

236
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:34,911
Even some of the trees are on her side.

237
00:23:38,882 --> 00:23:41,544
Can you find your way back from here?

238
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:44,781
- I think so.
- All right.

239
00:23:48,025 --> 00:23:51,859
- Will you be all right?
- [Laughs nervously]

I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

Here.

243
00:24:05,309 --> 00:24:09,370
Keep it. You need it more than I do.

244
00:24:13,017 --> 00:24:15,281
No matter what happens,
Lucy Pevensie,

245
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:17,820
I am glad to have met you.

246
00:24:17,888 --> 00:24:20,982
You've made me feel warmer
than I've felt in a hundred years.

247
00:24:22,693 --> 00:24:24,217
Now go.

248
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:25,852
Go!

Ready or not, here I come!

251
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:43,509
It's all right! I'm back! I'm all right!

252
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,980
Shut up! He's coming!

253
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:53,156
You know, I'm not sure you two
have quite got the idea of this game.

254
00:24:53,223 --> 00:24:55,748
Weren't you wondering where I was?

255
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:59,023
That's the point.
That was why he was seeking you.

256
00:24:59,096 --> 00:25:00,461
Does this mean I win?

257
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:02,692
I don't think Lucy
wants to play anymore.

258
00:25:02,766 --> 00:25:05,257
I've been gone for hours.

259
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,642
Lucy, the only wood in here
is the back of the wardrobe.

260
00:25:22,719 --> 00:25:26,917
One game at a time, Lu.
We don't all have your imagination.

261
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:33,956
[Lucy] But I wasn't imagining!

262
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:35,760
That's enough, Lucy.

263
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:38,267
I wouldn't lie about this!

264
00:25:38,335 --> 00:25:40,064
Well, I believe you.

265
00:25:40,904 --> 00:25:43,395
- You do?
- Yeah, of course.

266
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:46,034
Didn't I tell you about
the field in the cupboards?

267
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:48,271
Will you just stop?

268
00:25:48,345 --> 00:25:50,973
You just have to make
everything worse, don't you?

269
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:53,983
- It was just a joke!
- When are you gonna learn to grow up?

270
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:57,350
Shut up! You think you're Dad,
but you're not!

271
00:26:00,891 --> 00:26:03,416
Well, that was nicely handled.

272
00:26:05,295 --> 00:26:09,595
But... it really was there.

273
00:26:09,666 --> 00:26:12,726
Susan's right, Lucy.

274
00:26:12,803 --> 00:26:14,737
That's enough.

Boo!

00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,007
Lucy.

280
00:28:09,853 --> 00:28:12,287
Hope you're not afraid of the dark.

281
00:28:18,295 --> 00:28:19,956
Lucy?

282
00:28:25,569 --> 00:28:27,434
Lucy?

Make him let me go!
I didn't do anything wrong!

How dare you address
the Queen of Narnia?

298
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,085
I didn't know!

299

- [Woman] Wait!

What is your name, Son of Adam?

00:30:41,938 --> 00:30:44,202
Uh, Edmund.

302
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:48,370
And how, Edmund,
did you come to enter my dominion?

303
00:30:48,445 --> 00:30:52,438
I'm not sure.
I was just following my sister.

304
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:56,179
- Your sister? How many are you?
- Four.

305

Lucy's the only one
that's been here before.

306

She said she met some faun
called Tumnus.

307
00:31:03,093 --> 00:31:06,153
Peter and Susan didn't believe her.
I didn't either.

308
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:10,928
Edmund, you look so cold.
Will you come and sit with me?

309
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,785
Now, how about something hot to drink?

310
00:31:31,021 --> 00:31:34,684
Yes, please, Your Majesty.

311
00:31:51,675 --> 00:31:54,473
Your drink, sire.

312

How did you do that?

I can make anything you like.

I would very much like to meet
the rest of your family.

Why?

320

Oh, I'm sure they're not nearly
as delightful as you are.

322
00:32:52,235 --> 00:32:56,296
But you see, Edmund,
I have no children of my own.

323
00:32:56,373 --> 00:32:58,341
And you are exactly the sort of boy

324
00:32:58,408 --> 00:33:03,744
who I could see, one day,
becoming Prince of Narnia.

325
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,378
Maybe even King.

326
00:33:07,484 --> 00:33:09,452
Really?

327
00:33:10,186 --> 00:33:12,711
Of course, you'd have
to bring your family.

328
00:33:12,789 --> 00:33:14,086
Oh.

329
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:17,615
Do you mean,
Peter would be king too?

330
00:33:17,694 --> 00:33:20,288
No! No, no.

331
00:33:21,031 --> 00:33:24,091
But a king needs servants.

332
00:33:25,335 --> 00:33:27,803
I guess I could bring 'em.

333
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:35,270
Beyond these woods,
you see those two hills?

334
00:33:35,345 --> 00:33:38,508
My house is right between them.

335
00:33:38,582 --> 00:33:40,550
You'd love it there, Edmund.

336
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:44,951
It has whole rooms
simply stuffed with Turkish delight.

337
00:33:45,021 --> 00:33:48,286
- Couldn't I have some more now?
- No!

338
00:33:50,894 --> 00:33:53,226
Don't want to ruin your appetite.

339
00:33:53,296 --> 00:33:56,959
Besides, you and I are going to be
seeing each other again very soon.

340
00:33:57,033 --> 00:34:00,196
I hope so, Your Majesty.

341
00:34:01,037 --> 00:34:05,474
Until then, dear one.
Mmm, I'm gonna miss you.

342
00:34:07,243 --> 00:34:10,679
- Yah! Yah! Yah!
- [Snorting]

343
00:34:18,121 --> 00:34:19,850
[Lucy] Edmund?

344
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:23,855
Oh, Edmund! You got in too!

345
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:26,589
Isn't it wonderful?

346
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:30,895
- Where have you been?
- With Mr. Tumnus. He's fine.

347
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:34,835
The White Witch hasn't found out
anything about him meeting me.

348
00:34:34,904 --> 00:34:36,303
The White Witch?

349
00:34:37,107 --> 00:34:41,043
She calls herself the Queen of Narnia,
but she really isn't.

350
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:45,809
Are you all right? You look awful.

351
00:34:45,882 --> 00:34:49,818
Well, what'd you expect?
I mean, it's freezing.

352
00:34:49,886 --> 00:34:53,549
- How do we get out of here?
- Come on.

353
00:34:53,623 --> 00:34:55,250
This way.

354
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:57,350
[Door opens]

355
00:34:57,427 --> 00:34:59,918
Peter, Peter, wake up!
Peter, wake up!

356
00:34:59,996 --> 00:35:01,896
- It's there! It's really there!
- Shh.

357
00:35:01,965 --> 00:35:04,832
- Lucy, what are you talking about?
- Narnia!

358
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:07,267
It's all in the wardrobe
like I told you!

359
00:35:07,337 --> 00:35:10,431
- You've just been dreaming, Lucy.
- But I haven't!

360
00:35:10,507 --> 00:35:14,500
I saw Mr. Tumnus again!
And this time Edmund went too.

361
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:20,980
You... You saw the faun?

362
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:27,786
Well, he didn't actually
go there with me.

363
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:30,752
He...

364
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:35,856
What were you doing, Edmund?

365
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,495
I was just playing along.

366
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,195
I'm sorry, Peter.

367
00:35:43,273 --> 00:35:45,707
I shouldn't have encouraged her,

368
00:35:45,775 --> 00:35:48,710
but you know what little children
are like these days.

369
00:35:48,778 --> 00:35:52,407
They just don't know
when to stop pretending.

370
00:35:52,482 --> 00:35:54,416
[Sobbing]

371
00:35:55,652 --> 00:35:57,950
[Sighing]

372
00:35:59,222 --> 00:36:00,883
Ow!

373
00:36:01,758 --> 00:36:04,591
- [Sobbing]
- [Man] Oh!

374
00:36:10,233 --> 00:36:13,896
You children are one shenanigan
shy of sleepin' in the stable!

375
00:36:14,971 --> 00:36:20,932
Professor. I'm sorry. I told them
you were not to be disturbed.

376
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,343
It's all right, Mrs. Macready.
I'm sure there's an explanation.

377
00:36:25,615 --> 00:36:28,914
But first of all, I think this one
is in need of a little hot chocolate.

378
00:36:28,985 --> 00:36:32,318
- Come along, dear.
- [Clears throat]

379
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:44,058
You seem to have upset the delicate
internal balance of my housekeeper.

380
00:36:44,134 --> 00:36:46,967
We're very sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

381
00:36:47,036 --> 00:36:49,436
It's our sister, sir. Lucy.

382
00:36:49,506 --> 00:36:52,600
- The weeping girl.
- Yes, sir.

383
00:36:52,675 --> 00:36:55,644
- She's upset.
- Hence the weeping.

384
00:36:55,712 --> 00:36:57,145
It's nothing.

385
00:36:57,213 --> 00:37:00,114
- We can handle it.
- Oh, I can see that.

386
00:37:01,985 --> 00:37:04,715
She thinks she's found a magical land.

387
00:37:04,788 --> 00:37:07,655
In the upstairs wardrobe.

388
00:37:09,626 --> 00:37:11,355
What did you say?

389
00:37:11,427 --> 00:37:15,727
Um, the wardrobe, upstairs.

390
00:37:15,799 --> 00:37:18,267
Lucy thinks she's found a forest inside.

391
00:37:18,334 --> 00:37:20,529
She won't stop going on about it.

392
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:24,998
- What was it like?
- Like talking to a lunatic.

393
00:37:25,074 --> 00:37:27,565
No, no, no, not her.
The forest.

394
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:31,102
- You're not saying you believe her?
- You don't?

395
00:37:31,181 --> 00:37:32,648
[Susan] But of course not.

396
00:37:32,715 --> 00:37:35,240
I mean, logically, it's impossible.

397
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:38,185
What do they teach in schools
these days?

398
00:37:38,254 --> 00:37:40,188
Edmund said they were only pretending.

399
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:42,315
He's usually the more
truthful one, is he?

400
00:37:42,392 --> 00:37:46,294
No. This would be the first time.

401
00:37:46,362 --> 00:37:48,455
Well, if she's not mad
and she's not lying,

402
00:37:48,531 --> 00:37:53,059
then logically we must assume
she's telling the truth.

403
00:37:53,503 --> 00:37:56,700
You're saying that we
should just believe her?

404
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:02,337
She's your sister, isn't she?
You're her family.

405
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,313
You might just try acting like one.

406
00:38:07,851 --> 00:38:11,878
[Peter] Peter winds up,
poised to take yet another wicket!

407
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:13,616
Ow!

408
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,524
Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream.

409
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:20,522
Why can't we play hide and seek again?

410
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:23,225
I thought you said it was a kid's game.

411
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:27,702
Besides, we could all use the fresh air.

412
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:30,500
It's not like there isn't air inside.

413
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:35,269
- Are you ready?
- Are you?

414

[Shattering]

- Well done, Ed.
- You bowled it!

00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:56,865
- [Macready] What on earth is goin' on?
- The Macready!

No, no, back, back, back!

Get back!

- [Lucy] My toe!
- [Edmund] I'm not on your toe!

425
00:39:54,857 --> 00:39:57,690
- [Edmund] Move back.
- [Peter] Will you stop shoving?

426
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,728

[Gasps] Impossible.

Don't worry.

430
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:19,838
I'm sure it's just your imagination.

431
00:40:19,916 --> 00:40:23,079
[Stammering] I don't suppose
saying we're sorry

432
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:26,451
- would quite cover it.
- No. It wouldn't.

- But that might!
- Oh!

- Oh!

Ow!

00:40:41,437 --> 00:40:43,302
Stop it!

437
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,371
You little liar.

438
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:50,674
- You didn't believe her, either.
- Apologize to Lucy.

439
00:40:52,015 --> 00:40:55,746
- Say you're sorry.
- All right! I'm sorry.

440
00:40:55,818 --> 00:40:57,786
[Lucy] That's all right.

441
00:40:57,854 --> 00:41:00,846
Some children just don't know
when to stop pretending.

Oh, very funny.

443
00:41:02,458 --> 00:41:04,323
Maybe we should go back.

444
00:41:04,394 --> 00:41:07,886
But shouldn't we at least
take a look around?

445
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:09,693
I think Lucy should decide.

446
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:11,199
[Gasps]

447
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:14,464
I'd like you all to meet Mr. Tumnus!

448
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:16,732
Well, then Mr. Tumnus it is.

449
00:41:17,807 --> 00:41:21,174
But we can't go hiking in the snow
dressed like this.

450
00:41:21,244 --> 00:41:22,233
[Peter] No.

451
00:41:24,113 --> 00:41:27,810
But I'm sure the professor
wouldn't mind us using these.

452
00:41:27,884 --> 00:41:32,218
Anyway, if you think about it logically,

453
00:41:32,288 --> 00:41:34,688
we're not even taking them
out of the wardrobe.

00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:54,764
Who would do something like this?

[Glass breaks]

461
00:43:11,954 --> 00:43:15,412

Now we really should go back.

for being with a human,

I'm the human.

Don't worry, Lu.
We'll think of something.

Why?

476
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:00,862
I mean, he's a criminal.

00:44:05,908 --> 00:44:09,173
Did that bird just "psst" us?

479
00:44:24,994 --> 00:44:26,962
[Rustling]

480
00:44:51,754 --> 00:44:54,917
It... It's a beaver.

481
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,855
Here, boy. [clicks tongue]

482
00:45:02,932 --> 00:45:04,923
Here, boy.

483
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:06,730
[Clicking]

484
00:45:08,771 --> 00:45:12,138
I ain't gonna smell it,
if that's what you want.

485
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:13,539
- Oh.
- [Chuckling]

486
00:45:13,609 --> 00:45:14,974
Sorry.

487
00:45:15,311 --> 00:45:17,973
Lucy Pevensie?

488
00:45:22,551 --> 00:45:24,143
Yes?

489
00:45:33,496 --> 00:45:35,726
Hey, that's the hankie
I gave to Mr. Tum...

490
00:45:35,798 --> 00:45:38,892
Tumnus. He got it to me
just before they took him.

491
00:45:38,968 --> 00:45:40,367
Is he all right?

492
00:45:41,203 --> 00:45:43,171
Further in.

493
00:45:45,074 --> 00:45:47,975
- What are you doing?
- She's right.

494
00:45:48,044 --> 00:45:50,638
How do we know we can trust him?

495
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:52,442
He said he knows the faun.

496
00:45:52,515 --> 00:45:56,508
He's a beaver.
He shouldn't be saying anything!

497
00:45:56,585 --> 00:45:58,314
Everything all right?

498
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:00,685
Yes. We were just talking.

499
00:46:00,756 --> 00:46:03,816
[Whispering] That's better left
for safer quarters.

500
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:07,021
He means the trees.

501
00:46:21,711 --> 00:46:25,909
Come on. We don't want to be
caught out here after nightfall.

502
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:42,623
Ah, blimey! Looks like the old girl
has got the kettle on.

503
00:46:42,698 --> 00:46:44,393
Nice cup o' Rosy Lee.

504
00:46:44,467 --> 00:46:47,163
- [Lucy] It's lovely.
- [Beaver] It's merely a trifle.

505
00:46:47,236 --> 00:46:49,568
Still plenty to do.
Ain't quite finished it yet.

506
00:46:49,638 --> 00:46:51,540
It'll look the business
when it is, though.

507
00:46:53,142 --> 00:46:56,475
[Female voice] Beaver, is that you?
I've been worried sick!

508
00:46:56,545 --> 00:46:59,275
If I find you've been
out with Badger again, I...

509
00:47:00,149 --> 00:47:01,411
Oh!

510
00:47:01,484 --> 00:47:03,782
Well, those aren't badgers.

511
00:47:03,853 --> 00:47:08,517
Oh, I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

512
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:12,828
Look at my fur. You couldn't
give me ten minutes warning?

513
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
I'd have given a week
if I thought it would've helped.

514
00:47:15,531 --> 00:47:17,522
- [Chuckling]
- Oh, come inside,

515
00:47:17,600 --> 00:47:19,795
and we'll see if we
can't get you some food,

516
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:24,306
- and some civilized company.
- [Mr. Beaver chuckles]

517
00:47:24,373 --> 00:47:26,671
Now, careful. Watch your step.

518
00:47:26,742 --> 00:47:28,334
[Mrs. Beaver] Excuse the mess.

519
00:47:28,411 --> 00:47:31,471
Can't get Mr. Beaver
to get out of his chair.

520
00:47:35,684 --> 00:47:38,278
Enjoyin' the scenery, are we?

521
00:47:42,057 --> 00:47:44,787
Isn't there anything
we can do to help Tumnus?

522
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:47,954
They'll have taken him to the Witch's.
You know what they say.

523
00:47:48,030 --> 00:47:51,898
There's few that go through
them gates that come out again.

524
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:54,458
Fish 'n' chips?

525
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:58,699
But there is hope, dear.
Lots of hope.

526
00:47:58,774 --> 00:48:02,175
[Spits] Oh, yeah,
there's a right bit more than hope!

527
00:48:03,112 --> 00:48:06,013
Aslan is on the move.

528
00:48:13,022 --> 00:48:14,284
Who's Aslan?

529
00:48:14,356 --> 00:48:17,257
[Laughing] Who's Aslan?

530
00:48:17,326 --> 00:48:20,318
You cheeky little blighter.

531
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,328
What?

532
00:48:25,868 --> 00:48:29,326
- You don't know, do you?
- We haven't exactly been here long.

533
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:31,805
Well, he's only the king
of the whole wood.

534
00:48:31,874 --> 00:48:35,435
The top geezer.
The real King of Narnia.

535
00:48:35,511 --> 00:48:39,447
- He's been away for a long while.
- But he's just got back!

536
00:48:39,515 --> 00:48:42,313
And he's waitin' for you
near the Stone Table!

537
00:48:42,384 --> 00:48:45,444
- He's waiting for us?
- You're bloomin' joking!

538
00:48:45,521 --> 00:48:48,115
They don't even know about the prophecy!

539
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:52,024
- Well, then...
- Look.

540
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:54,289
Aslan's return,

541
00:48:54,363 --> 00:48:57,662
Tumnus' arrest, the secret police,

542
00:48:57,733 --> 00:48:59,860
it's all happening because of you!

543
00:48:59,935 --> 00:49:03,336
- You're blaming us?
- No! Not blaming.

544
00:49:03,405 --> 00:49:07,273
- Thanking you.
- There's a prophecy.

545
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:10,244
"When Adam's flesh and Adam's bone

546
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:13,372
sits at Cair Paravel in throne,

547
00:49:13,449 --> 00:49:16,111
the evil time will be over and done."

548
00:49:16,185 --> 00:49:18,517
- That doesn't really rhyme.
- I know it don't.

549
00:49:18,587 --> 00:49:20,885
You're kinda missin' the point!

550
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:23,390
It has long been foretold

551
00:49:23,459 --> 00:49:26,189
that two Sons of Adam
and two Daughters of Eve

552
00:49:26,262 --> 00:49:31,529
will defeat the White Witch
and restore peace to Narnia.

553
00:49:33,903 --> 00:49:35,427
And you think we're the ones?

554
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:38,530
You'd better be, 'cause Aslan's
already fitted out your army.

555
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,575
- Our army?
- Mum sent us away

556
00:49:40,643 --> 00:49:43,510
so we wouldn't get
caught up in a war.

557
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,078
I think you've made a mistake.

558
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:50,050
- We're not heroes.
- We're from Finchley.

559
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:52,212
Hmm.

560
00:49:52,288 --> 00:49:55,382
Thank you for your hospitality.

561
00:49:56,358 --> 00:49:59,987
- But we really have to go.
- No, you can't just leave!

562
00:50:00,062 --> 00:50:03,725
He's right.
We have to help Mr. Tumnus.

563
00:50:03,799 --> 00:50:06,324
It's out of our hands.

564
00:50:06,402 --> 00:50:07,835
I'm sorry,

565
00:50:07,903 --> 00:50:11,134
but it's time the four of us
were getting home. Ed?

566
00:50:13,676 --> 00:50:15,371
Ed?

567
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:20,780
- I'm gonna kill him.
- [Mr. Beaver] You may not have to.

568
00:50:20,849 --> 00:50:23,875
Has Edmund ever been to Narnia before?

569
00:50:50,646 --> 00:50:51,943
Hurry!

570
00:51:12,334 --> 00:51:14,962
- Edmund!
- Shh! They'll hear you!

571
00:51:16,138 --> 00:51:17,298
No!

572
00:51:17,373 --> 00:51:19,807
- [Peter] Get off!
- You're playing into her hands.

573
00:51:19,875 --> 00:51:22,309
- We can't just let him go!
- He's our brother!

574
00:51:22,378 --> 00:51:25,438
He's the bait!
The Witch wants all four of you!

575
00:51:25,514 --> 00:51:29,416
- Why?
- To stop the prophecy from coming true.

576
00:51:29,485 --> 00:51:30,884
To kill you!

577
00:51:40,863 --> 00:51:44,128
- This is all your fault.
- My fault?

578
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:47,259
None of this would have happened
if you had listened to me!

579
00:51:47,336 --> 00:51:49,566
- You knew this would happen.
- I didn't know.

580
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:52,266
Which is why we should
have left while we could!

581
00:51:52,341 --> 00:51:53,365
Stop it!

582
00:51:54,510 --> 00:51:58,276
- This isn't going to help Edmund.
- [Mr. Beaver] She's right.

583
00:51:58,347 --> 00:52:01,510
Only Aslan can help your brother now.

584
00:52:03,185 --> 00:52:04,812
Then take us to him.

585
00:53:13,422 --> 00:53:14,855
- [Growling]
- [Grunts]

586
00:53:14,923 --> 00:53:17,949
Be still, stranger,
or you'll never move again.

587
00:53:18,494 --> 00:53:20,155
- Who are you?
- I'm Edmund!

588
00:53:20,229 --> 00:53:23,858
I met the Queen in the woods!
She told me to come back here!

589
00:53:23,932 --> 00:53:25,399
I'm a Son of Adam!

590
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:30,495
Hmm. My apologies,
fortunate favorite of the queen.

591
00:53:30,572 --> 00:53:33,905
Or else, not so fortunate.

592
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,011
Right this way.

593
00:54:01,136 --> 00:54:02,933
Wait here.

594
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:43,371
Like it?

595
00:54:43,445 --> 00:54:48,382
Uh... Yes, Your Majesty.

596
00:54:50,819 --> 00:54:52,946
I thought you might.

597
00:54:54,990 --> 00:54:56,719
Tell me, Edmund...

598
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:01,520
Are your sisters deaf?

599
00:55:01,597 --> 00:55:03,292
No.

600
00:55:03,365 --> 00:55:06,232
And your brother, is he...

601
00:55:08,103 --> 00:55:10,037
...unintelligent?

602
00:55:10,105 --> 00:55:12,539
Well, I think so.
But Mum says...

603
00:55:12,608 --> 00:55:16,738
Then how dare you come alone?!

604
00:55:16,812 --> 00:55:19,542
- I tried!
- Edmund, I asked so little of you.

605
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:22,516
- They just don't listen to me!
- You couldn't even do that.

606
00:55:22,584 --> 00:55:24,074
I did bring them halfway.

607
00:55:24,152 --> 00:55:26,848
They're at the little house at the dam
with the Beavers.

608
00:55:34,029 --> 00:55:35,963
Well.

609
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:39,967
I suppose you're not
a total loss then, are you?

610
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:44,638
Well, I was wondering,

611
00:55:45,607 --> 00:55:50,670
could I maybe have some more
Turkish delight now?

612
00:55:56,184 --> 00:55:58,277
Our guest is hungry.

613
00:56:04,927 --> 00:56:08,419
This way for your num-nums.

614
00:56:10,532 --> 00:56:13,501
- Maugrim?
- [Growling]

615
00:56:15,437 --> 00:56:17,564
You know what to do.

616
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:20,130
[Growling]

617
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:22,199
[Howling]

618
00:56:22,277 --> 00:56:24,711
[Snarling]

619
00:56:35,857 --> 00:56:37,757
[Barking]

620
00:56:37,826 --> 00:56:39,851
[Howling]

621
00:56:43,732 --> 00:56:45,011
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

622
00:56:45,046 --> 00:56:46,290
Hurry, Mother! They're after us!

623
00:56:46,368 --> 00:56:49,337
- Oh, right then.
- What's she doing?

624
00:56:50,038 --> 00:56:51,767
Oh, you'll be thanking me later.

625
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:55,241
It's a long journey and Beaver
gets pretty cranky when he's hungry.

626
00:56:55,310 --> 00:56:56,834
I'm cranky now!

627
00:56:59,047 --> 00:57:00,344
Take them.

628
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:07,344
- Do you think we'll need jam?
- Only if the Witch serves toast.

629
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:09,219
[Snarling]

630
00:57:22,571 --> 00:57:23,595
Hurry.

631
00:57:23,672 --> 00:57:25,902
[Cracking]

632
00:57:39,054 --> 00:57:42,387
Badger and me dug this.
Comes out right near his place.

633
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:44,721
[Mrs. Beaver] You told me
it led to your mum's!

634
00:57:45,393 --> 00:57:46,792
Lucy!

635
00:57:48,396 --> 00:57:49,886
They're in the tunnel.

636
00:57:49,965 --> 00:57:52,991
- [Mr. Beaver] Quick! This way.
- [Mrs. Beaver] Hurry!

637
00:57:54,202 --> 00:57:56,397
- Run!
- Quick! Quick! Quick!

638
00:58:04,713 --> 00:58:06,681
You should have brought a map!

639
00:58:06,748 --> 00:58:09,478
There wasn't room next to the jam.

640
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:18,792
- [Susan] Come on, Lucy!
- [Straining]

641
00:58:21,329 --> 00:58:22,660
[Grunts]

642
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:41,479
I'm so sorry, dear.

643
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,814
He was my best mate.

644
00:58:53,061 --> 00:58:54,323
What happened here?

645
00:58:54,396 --> 00:58:57,229
This is what becomes
of those who cross the Witch.

646
00:58:57,299 --> 00:59:01,065
You take one more step, traitor,
and I'll chew you to splinters!

647
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:04,003
Relax. I'm one of the good guys.

648
00:59:04,072 --> 00:59:08,133
Yeah? Well, you look an awful lot
like one of the bad ones.

649
00:59:08,210 --> 00:59:10,542
An unfortunate family resemblance.

650
00:59:10,612 --> 00:59:13,843
But we can argue breeding later.
Right now we've got to move.

651
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:15,246
[Howling]

652
00:59:15,317 --> 00:59:17,342
What did you have in mind?

653
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:20,212
[Snarling]

654
00:59:24,893 --> 00:59:26,554
Greetings, gents.

655
00:59:27,329 --> 00:59:30,696
- Lost something, have we?
- Don't patronize me!

656
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:33,461
I know where your allegiance lies.

657
00:59:33,535 --> 00:59:36,732
- We're looking for some humans.
- [Laughs]

658
00:59:36,805 --> 00:59:39,137
Humans? Here in Narnia?

659
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:42,005
That's a valuable bit of information,
don't you think?

660
00:59:42,077 --> 00:59:43,840
- [Snarling]
- [Gasps]

661
00:59:43,912 --> 00:59:46,244
Your reward is your life.

662
00:59:46,314 --> 00:59:48,782
It's not much,

663
00:59:49,551 --> 00:59:51,018
but still.

664
00:59:51,653 --> 00:59:53,712
Where are the fugitives?

665
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:57,224
- [Whimpering]
- [Snarling]

666
01:00:00,662 --> 01:00:03,654
North. They ran north.

667
01:00:04,566 --> 01:00:06,557
Smell them out.

668
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:09,900
[Yelping]

669
01:00:16,845 --> 01:00:20,781
[Fox] They were helping Tumnus.
The Witch got here before I did.

670
01:00:20,849 --> 01:00:23,477
[Groaning] Ow! Oh!

671
01:00:23,551 --> 01:00:24,984
Are you all right?

672
01:00:25,053 --> 01:00:28,216
Well, I wish I could say their bark
was worse than their bite. Ow!

673
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:32,727
Stop squirming!
You're worse than Beaver on bath day.

674
01:00:32,794 --> 01:00:34,284
Worst day of the year.

675
01:00:34,362 --> 01:00:36,887
Thank you for your kindness,

676
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:39,092
but that's all the cure I have time for.

677
01:00:39,167 --> 01:00:40,156
You're leaving?

678
01:00:40,235 --> 01:00:43,830
It has been a pleasure, My Queen,
and an honor, but time is short

679
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:47,068
and Aslan himself has asked me
to gather more troops.

680
01:00:47,142 --> 01:00:50,976
- You've seen Aslan?
- [Gasping] What's he like?

681
01:00:51,046 --> 01:00:54,140
Like everything we've ever heard.

682
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:57,742
You'll be glad to have him by your side
in the battle against the Witch.

683
01:00:57,819 --> 01:01:00,617
But we're not planning
on fighting any witch.

684
01:01:00,689 --> 01:01:03,487
But surely, King Peter, the prophecy!

685
01:01:03,558 --> 01:01:05,719
We can't go to war without you.

686
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:13,530
We just want our brother back.

687
01:01:29,117 --> 01:01:31,642
[Coughing, gagging]

688
01:01:38,360 --> 01:01:39,987
If...

689
01:01:41,463 --> 01:01:44,455
If you're not going to eat that...

690
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:52,931
I'd get up, but...

691
01:01:53,008 --> 01:01:55,272
...but my legs.

692
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,618
Mr. Tumnus.

693
01:02:09,157 --> 01:02:11,125
What's left of him.

694
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,467
- You're Lucy Pevensie's brother.
- I'm Edmund.

695
01:02:22,604 --> 01:02:25,869
Yes. Yes, you have the same nose.

696
01:02:30,345 --> 01:02:32,108
Is your sister all right?

697
01:02:34,682 --> 01:02:36,240
Is she safe?

698
01:02:36,317 --> 01:02:37,341
[Howling]

699
01:02:40,121 --> 01:02:42,180
I don't know.

700
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:43,952
[Door unlocking]

701
01:02:49,297 --> 01:02:52,858
My police tore that dam apart.

702
01:02:53,735 --> 01:02:57,330
Your little family
are nowhere to be found.

703
01:03:01,376 --> 01:03:04,277
- Where did they go?
- [Stammering] I don't know!

704
01:03:05,013 --> 01:03:07,641
Then you're of no further use to me.

705
01:03:07,715 --> 01:03:12,084
Wait! The beaver
said something about Aslan!

706
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:17,981
Aslan?

707
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:20,351
Where?

708
01:03:22,997 --> 01:03:25,761
- I...
- He's a stranger here, Your Majesty.

709
01:03:25,834 --> 01:03:27,802
He can't be expected
to know anything.

710
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:29,461
[Grunts]

711
01:03:29,737 --> 01:03:33,605
I said... where is Aslan?

712
01:03:37,979 --> 01:03:40,140
I... I don't know.

713
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:42,615
I left before they said anything.

714
01:03:45,086 --> 01:03:47,452
I wanted to see you!

715
01:03:49,757 --> 01:03:51,554
Guard!

716
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:53,957
Your Majesty.

717
01:03:56,164 --> 01:03:58,997
- Release the faun.
- [Grunts]

718
01:03:59,767 --> 01:04:02,292
Ah! Ah!

719
01:04:08,743 --> 01:04:10,973
[Tumnus groaning]

720
01:04:11,546 --> 01:04:13,571
Do you know why you're here, faun?

721
01:04:15,183 --> 01:04:20,143
Because I believe in a free Narnia.

722
01:04:21,156 --> 01:04:23,454
You're here...

723
01:04:23,525 --> 01:04:27,017
...because he turned you in.

724
01:04:28,796 --> 01:04:30,286
For sweeties.

725
01:04:38,139 --> 01:04:40,004
Take him upstairs.

726
01:04:40,074 --> 01:04:41,837
[Grunts]

727
01:04:45,713 --> 01:04:48,375
- And ready my sleigh.
- [Tumnus groaning]

728
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:51,111
Edmund misses his family.

729
01:04:56,791 --> 01:04:59,760
[Door slamming]

730
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:17,033
[Mr. Beaver] Now, Aslan's camp
is near the Stone Table

731
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:20,672
- just across the frozen river.
- River?

732
01:05:20,748 --> 01:05:24,741
The river's been frozen solid
for a hundred years.

733
01:05:27,855 --> 01:05:31,291
- It's so far.
- [Mrs. Beaver] It's the world, dear.

734
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:33,224
Did you expect it to be small?

735
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:36,426
Smaller.

736
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:56,240
When you're ready, Son of Adam.

737
01:06:03,858 --> 01:06:06,326
Yah! Yah! Yah!

738
01:06:31,519 --> 01:06:35,319
Come on, humans!
While we're still young.

739
01:06:36,024 --> 01:06:38,822
If he tells us to hurry one more time,

740
01:06:38,893 --> 01:06:42,693
I'm gonna turn him
into a big, fluffy hat.

741
01:06:42,764 --> 01:06:45,096
Hurry up! Come on!

742
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:48,897
- He is getting a little bossy.
- [Mrs. Beaver] Behind you! It's her!

743
01:06:48,970 --> 01:06:50,870
- Run! Run!
- Run!

744
01:06:50,938 --> 01:06:52,565
[Jingling]

745
01:07:16,064 --> 01:07:17,361
Hurry!

746
01:07:20,168 --> 01:07:21,829
[Mr. Beaver] Inside!

747
01:07:21,903 --> 01:07:23,768
Dive! Dive!

748
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:28,401
Quick! Quick, quick, quick!

749
01:07:28,476 --> 01:07:29,943
[Jingling]

750
01:07:56,671 --> 01:07:59,139
Maybe she's gone.

751
01:08:00,041 --> 01:08:02,532
- I suppose I'll go look.
- No!

752
01:08:02,610 --> 01:08:05,204
You're worth nothing to Narnia dead.

753
01:08:05,279 --> 01:08:07,270
Well, neither are you, Beaver.

754
01:08:07,348 --> 01:08:09,543
Thanks, sweetheart.

755
01:08:14,756 --> 01:08:16,917
[Whimpering]

756
01:08:17,925 --> 01:08:21,554
- What's that? What's...
- Shh, shh, shh.

757
01:08:21,629 --> 01:08:24,462
[Footsteps]

758
01:08:24,532 --> 01:08:26,295
- Come out! Come out!
- [Shrieks]

759
01:08:26,367 --> 01:08:29,564
I hope you've all been good
'cause there's someone here to see you!

760
01:08:44,085 --> 01:08:45,950
[Chuckling]

761
01:08:51,392 --> 01:08:53,292
Merry Christmas, sir.

762
01:08:53,361 --> 01:08:57,388
It certainly is, Lucy,
since you have arrived.

763
01:08:57,465 --> 01:09:01,526
Look, I've put up with a lot
since I got here, but this...

764
01:09:01,602 --> 01:09:05,060
- We thought you were the Witch.
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry about that,

765
01:09:05,139 --> 01:09:10,634
but in my defense, I have been driving
one of these longer than the Witch.

766
01:09:10,711 --> 01:09:13,839
I thought there was
no Christmas in Narnia.

767
01:09:13,915 --> 01:09:16,475
No. For a long time.

768
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:20,885
But the hope that you have brought,
Your Majesties,

769
01:09:20,955 --> 01:09:24,823
is finally starting
to weaken the Witch's power.

770
01:09:24,892 --> 01:09:29,124
Still, I dare say
you could do with these.

771
01:09:31,833 --> 01:09:33,960
- [Chuckling]
- Presents!

772
01:09:40,475 --> 01:09:42,807
The juice of the fire-flower.

773
01:09:42,877 --> 01:09:47,007
One drop will cure any injury.

774
01:09:48,549 --> 01:09:51,143
And though I hope
you never have to use it...

775
01:09:54,222 --> 01:09:56,122
Thank you, sir,

776
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:59,626
but I think I could be brave enough.

777
01:09:59,694 --> 01:10:02,390
I'm sure you could.

778
01:10:02,463 --> 01:10:05,921
But battles are ugly affairs.

779
01:10:12,540 --> 01:10:14,337
Susan.

780
01:10:16,777 --> 01:10:21,612
Trust in this bow
and it will not easily miss.

781
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:25,344
What happened
to "battles are ugly affairs"?

782
01:10:25,419 --> 01:10:27,546
[Chuckles]

783
01:10:27,622 --> 01:10:30,819
Though you don't seem to have
a problem making yourself heard,

784
01:10:30,892 --> 01:10:34,760
blow on this
and wherever you are,

785
01:10:34,829 --> 01:10:37,059
help will come.

786
01:10:38,132 --> 01:10:39,963
Thanks.

787
01:10:40,801 --> 01:10:42,632
Peter.

788
01:10:43,838 --> 01:10:47,706
The time to use these
may be near at hand.

789
01:10:55,383 --> 01:10:56,577
Thank you, sir.

790
01:10:57,351 --> 01:11:01,185
These are tools, not toys.

791
01:11:01,255 --> 01:11:03,485
Bear them well and wisely.

792
01:11:05,192 --> 01:11:07,888
Now, I must be off.

793
01:11:07,962 --> 01:11:10,522
Winter is almost over,

794
01:11:10,598 --> 01:11:15,035
and things do pile up
when you've been gone a hundred years.

795
01:11:15,102 --> 01:11:16,797
[Chuckles]

No! Stay your weapons.
This is Peter's battle.

961
01:25:36,496 --> 01:25:38,623
You may think you're a king,

962
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:40,996
but you're going to die...

963

- [Yelping, barking]
- After him.

967
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:07,820
He'll lead you to Edmund.

968
01:26:12,032 --> 01:26:13,556
Peter.

969
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:15,859
Clean your sword.

970
01:26:20,507 --> 01:26:25,171
Rise, Sir Peter Wolf's-Bane,

971
01:26:25,245 --> 01:26:28,043
Knight of Narnia.

The minotaurs will take the left flanks.

974
01:26:55,876 --> 01:26:59,073
We'll keep the giants in reserve
and send the dwarfs in first.

Ah!

978
01:27:08,121 --> 01:27:09,952
The prisoner!

[Ginarrbrik] You're not
going to kill me?

983
01:27:43,924 --> 01:27:45,892
Not yet.

984

- [Indistinct chatter]

[Gasps] Edmund!

988
01:28:56,296 --> 01:28:58,560
What's done is done.

989
01:28:58,631 --> 01:29:02,727
There is no need to speak to Edmund
about what is past.

990
01:29:11,578 --> 01:29:13,239
Hello.

991
01:29:27,227 --> 01:29:30,355
- Are you all right?
- I'm a little tired.

992
01:29:30,430 --> 01:29:32,728
Get some sleep.

993
01:29:40,707 --> 01:29:42,800
And Edmund...

994
01:29:44,978 --> 01:29:46,605
...try not to wander off.

995
01:29:59,993 --> 01:30:02,393
Narnia's not going
to run out of toast, Ed.

996
01:30:04,164 --> 01:30:07,531
I'm sure they'll pack something up
for the journey back.

997
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:08,965
We're going home?

998
01:30:09,903 --> 01:30:12,030
You are.

999
01:30:12,739 --> 01:30:15,230
I promised Mum I'd keep you three safe.

1000
01:30:16,109 --> 01:30:18,600
But it doesn't mean
I can't stay behind and help.

1001
01:30:18,678 --> 01:30:21,078
But they need us.

1002
01:30:22,215 --> 01:30:24,445
All four of us.

1003
01:30:24,517 --> 01:30:26,417
Lucy, it's too dangerous.

1004
01:30:26,486 --> 01:30:29,046
You almost drowned!
Edmund was almost killed!

1005
01:30:29,789 --> 01:30:32,656
Which is why we have to stay.

1006
01:30:34,360 --> 01:30:39,127
I've seen what the White Witch can do.
And I've helped her do it.

1007
01:30:40,533 --> 01:30:44,333
And we can't leave these
people behind to suffer for it.

1008
01:30:51,511 --> 01:30:54,036
I suppose that's it then.

1009
01:30:55,381 --> 01:30:56,939
Where are you going?

1010
01:30:58,751 --> 01:31:01,185
To get in some practice.

- Oh.

01:31:40,026 --> 01:31:41,823
[Stammers] Sorry.

1019
01:31:41,895 --> 01:31:44,489
The Witch has demanded
a meeting with Aslan.

1020
01:31:45,832 --> 01:31:48,164
She's on her way here.

1021
01:31:48,234 --> 01:31:50,098
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

1022
01:31:50,133 --> 01:31:51,962
Jadis, the Queen of Narnia!

1023
01:31:52,038 --> 01:31:56,304
- [Male voice #1] Go away, Witch!
- Empress of the Lone Islands!

1024
01:31:57,010 --> 01:32:00,002
[Male voice #2] You don't belong here!
Go away!

You have a traitor in your midst, Aslan.

[Crowd murmuring]

1029
01:32:29,776 --> 01:32:32,677
His offense was not against you.

1030
01:32:33,213 --> 01:32:36,478
Have you forgotten the laws
upon which Narnia was built?

1031
01:32:36,549 --> 01:32:40,041
Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch.

1032
01:32:40,119 --> 01:32:43,213
I was there when it was written.

1033
01:32:44,023 --> 01:32:49,188
Then you'll remember well
that every traitor belongs to me.

1034
01:32:49,662 --> 01:32:52,563
- His blood is my property.
- [Swords unsheathing]

- [Grunting]

1036

Do you really think that mere force
will deny me my right...

01:33:03,009 --> 01:33:04,772
...little King?

1038
01:33:07,313 --> 01:33:11,079
Aslan knows that unless I have blood,
as the law demands,

1039
01:33:11,150 --> 01:33:14,586
all of Narnia will be overturned

1040
01:33:14,654 --> 01:33:17,646
and perish in fire and water.

1041
01:33:17,724 --> 01:33:20,955
That boy will die

1042

- on the Stone Table...
- [crowd murmuring]

You dare not refuse me.

1045
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:35,439
Enough.

1046
01:33:38,511 --> 01:33:40,741
I shall talk with you alone.

1047

We couldn't sleep.

Please, Aslan.

Couldn't we come with you?

02:10:25,649 --> 02:10:28,209
- Lucy!
- Not again.

1291
02:10:29,920 --> 02:10:32,411
- [Peter] Lu?
- Come on!

1292
02:10:43,400 --> 02:10:44,958
These aren't branches.

1293
02:10:46,470 --> 02:10:47,459
[Edmund] Ow! Ooh!

1294
02:10:47,538 --> 02:10:50,598
- They're coats.
- [Edmund] Susan, you're on my foot!

1295
02:10:50,674 --> 02:10:52,869
[Lucy] Peter, move off!

1296
02:10:52,943 --> 02:10:55,104
- [Peter] Stop shoving.
- [Edmund] Stop it!

1297
02:10:55,179 --> 02:10:57,010
I'm not on your toe!

1298
02:10:57,081 --> 02:10:59,845
[All grunting]

1299
02:11:12,096 --> 02:11:13,757
[Kirke] Oh!

1300
02:11:14,830 --> 02:11:16,425
There you are.

1301
02:11:19,005 --> 02:11:21,765
What were you all
doing in the wardrobe?

1302
02:11:23,675 --> 02:11:26,470
You wouldn't believe us
if we told you, sir.

1303
02:11:32,250 --> 02:11:33,910
Try me.

1304
02:12:36,615 --> 02:12:39,375
[Kirke] I don't think
you'll get back in that way.

1305
02:12:42,485 --> 02:12:47,151
You see... I've already tried.

1306
02:12:49,195 --> 02:12:51,185
Will we ever go back?

1307
02:12:51,260 --> 02:12:52,955
Oh, I expect so.

1308
02:12:54,100 --> 02:12:57,065
But it'll probably happen
when you're not looking for it.

1309
02:12:59,605 --> 02:13:01,230
All the same...

1310
02:13:01,305 --> 02:13:03,830
[whispers] best to keep your eyes open.

1311
02:13:13,115 --> 02:13:15,815
