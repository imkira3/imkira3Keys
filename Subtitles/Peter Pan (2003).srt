1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:55,924 --> 00:00:58,358
<i>Cinderella flew through the air...</i>

3
00:00:58,426 --> 00:01:01,793
<i>far from all things</i>
<i>ugly and ordinary.</i>

4
00:01:01,863 --> 00:01:04,491
<i>When she landed at the ball,</i>
<i>she found herself...</i>

5
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:07,899
<i>most impertinently surrounded</i>
<i>by pirates.</i>

6
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:12,599
<i>There was Alf Mason,</i>
<i>so ugly his mother sold him</i>
<i>for a bottle of muscat.</i>

7
00:01:12,674 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>Bill Jukes,</i>
<i>every inch ofhim tattooed.</i>

8
00:01:17,279 --> 00:01:19,645
<i>And worst of them all,</i>

9
00:01:19,714 --> 00:01:24,014
Hook, with eyes blue
as forget-me-nots,

10
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:28,647
save when he clawed your belly
with the iron hook he has...

11
00:01:28,723 --> 00:01:31,715
instead of a right hand,
at which time...

12
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:35,320
his eyes turn red.

13
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:38,365
"Girlie," said Hook,

14
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:40,697
"we have come
for ye glass slippers."

15
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:44,728
<i>Who be you to order me about</i>
<i>and call me girlie?</i>
<i>Take that.!</i>

16
00:01:44,806 --> 00:01:47,036
Take that! Take that!

17
00:01:49,411 --> 00:01:51,402
<i>Commoner.!</i>

18
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:54,346
<i>-Hook came at her.</i>

19
00:01:56,184 --> 00:01:58,277
<i>What happened then?</i>
<i>What happened then?</i>

20
00:01:58,353 --> 00:02:01,584
<i>The brave Cinderella settled</i>
<i>the matter once and for all...</i>

21
00:02:01,656 --> 00:02:04,523
<i>with her revolver.</i>
<i>With her revolver?</i>

22
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,890
<i>The night on which</i>
<i>the extraordinary adventures...</i>

23
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,691
<i>of these children</i>
<i>may be said to have begun...</i>

24
00:02:09,764 --> 00:02:12,631
<i>was the night Nana</i>
<i>barked at the window.</i>

25
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:16,159
<i>But there was nothing there,</i>
<i>not a bird or a leaf.</i>

26
00:02:16,237 --> 00:02:18,228
<i>So the children forgot</i>
<i>about it,</i>

27
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:22,072
<i>for what troubles a grown-up</i>
<i>will never trouble a child.</i>

28
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,450
Oh, dearest George, dear Mary.
Oh, what a journey I've had.

29
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,284
Bath time.

30
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:46,500
Not fair!

31
00:02:46,568 --> 00:02:50,971
<i>Not fair, indeed. But Nana was</i>
<i>the finest nurse on four paws.</i>

32
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:53,803
<i>No. No, I will not</i>
<i>forgive you.</i>

33
00:02:54,142 --> 00:02:57,839
<i>There never was</i>
<i>a happier, simpler family.</i>

34
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:03,111
<i>Mr. Darling was a banker</i>
<i>who knew the cost of everything,</i>
<i>even a hug.</i>

35
00:03:03,184 --> 00:03:06,847
<i>Mrs. Darling was the loveliest</i>
<i>lady in Bloomsbury...</i>

36
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:11,085
<i>with a sweet, mocking mouth</i>
<i>that had one kiss on it...</i>

37
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,184
<i>that Wendy could never get.</i>

38
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:15,388
<i>Though there it was,</i>

39
00:03:15,463 --> 00:03:19,524
<i>perfectly conspicuous</i>
<i>on the right-hand corner.</i>

40
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,260
<i>And sometimes there</i>
<i>was Aunt Millicent...</i>

41
00:03:23,338 --> 00:03:26,535
<i>who felt a dog for a nurse</i>
<i>lowered the whole tone</i>
<i>of the neighborhood.</i>

42
00:03:26,608 --> 00:03:29,771
All right, all right,
all right, all right.
Less noise.

43
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:33,109
- Let's settle down.
This is not a farm.

44
00:03:33,181 --> 00:03:35,877
<i>- Bravo, George. Bravo.</i>
<i>- Wendy's turn.</i>

45
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:39,511
Wendy must tell a story.

46
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,522
<i>Cecco, who carved his name</i>
<i>on the governor at Goa.</i>

47
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,219
<i>Noodler, with his hands</i>
<i>on backwards.</i>

48
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:48,023
- Heavens.
- Hook!

49
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,658
- Hook?
- Hook, whose eyes turn red
as he guts you.

50
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:55,567
Upon my soul, how children
are educated nowadays.

51
00:03:55,637 --> 00:03:58,538
- I'm afraid I am not
learned at all, Aunt.

52
00:03:58,606 --> 00:04:01,404
- But I do know a thing or two
about pirates.
- Ooh.

53
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:05,845
My unfulfilled ambition is
to write a great novel in three
parts about my adventures.

54
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:08,815
- What adventures?
- I've yet to have them,

55
00:04:08,883 --> 00:04:10,817
but they will be
perfectly thrilling.

56
00:04:10,885 --> 00:04:14,480
But, child, novelists
are not highly thought of
in good society.

57
00:04:14,556 --> 00:04:18,048
And there is nothing
so difficult to marry as a novelist.

58
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:19,923
- Marry?
- Marry?

59
00:04:19,994 --> 00:04:23,555
- Marry?
- But, Aunt, Wendy is not yet 13.

60
00:04:25,333 --> 00:04:28,097
Walk toward me, dear,
that I may appraise you.

61
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:30,330
<i>Go on.</i>

62
00:04:30,405 --> 00:04:34,000
Walk to your auntie.
Stand up straight.

63
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:40,443
- Stop it!
- Turn around.

64
00:04:43,084 --> 00:04:45,109
Shh.

65
00:04:45,186 --> 00:04:47,518
Mm, yes.

66
00:04:47,589 --> 00:04:50,183
Oh, it's quite as I expected.

67
00:04:50,258 --> 00:04:53,386
Wendy possesses a woman's chin.

68
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:59,565
Have you not noticed?
Observe her mouth.

69
00:04:59,634 --> 00:05:02,603
<i>There, hidden</i>
<i>in the right-hand corner,</i>

70
00:05:04,606 --> 00:05:06,267
is that a kiss?

71
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:11,309
- A kiss?
- Like Mother's kiss.

72
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,440
<i>- A hidden kiss.</i>
<i>- But what is it for?</i>

73
00:05:16,784 --> 00:05:19,412
It is for the greatest
adventure of all.

74
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,648
They that find it...

75
00:05:21,723 --> 00:05:24,886
have slipped in and out of heaven.

76
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:26,893
Find what?

77
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:30,328
The one the kiss belongs to.

78
00:05:31,499 --> 00:05:33,433
My Wendy...

79
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,629
a woman.
Almost a woman.

80
00:05:36,704 --> 00:05:39,002
She must spend less time
with her brothers...

81
00:05:39,073 --> 00:05:41,337
<i>and more time with me.</i>

82
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,775
She must have her own room.

83
00:05:43,845 --> 00:05:47,246
<i>Ayoung lady's room.</i>
<i>Leave the...</i>

84
00:05:47,315 --> 00:05:51,149
George, the daughter
of a clerk cannot hope to marry
as well as that of a manager.

85
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:54,211
You must attend more parties,

86
00:05:54,289 --> 00:05:57,452
make small talk with
your superiors at the bank.

87
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,517
Wit is very fashionable
at the moment.

88
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,189
Wit.

89
00:07:05,093 --> 00:07:07,891
<i>But there was no sign of a body,</i>

90
00:07:07,962 --> 00:07:10,430
<i>for none had fallen.</i>

91
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:13,558
<i>Certainly she had been dreaming.</i>

92
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:29,745
If this is you in bed,

93
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:33,048
what is this?

94
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:35,885
A boy.

95
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:40,792
<i>Miss Fulsom dispatched a letter</i>
<i>of outrage to Mr. Darling...</i>

96
00:07:40,862 --> 00:07:43,092
<i>that set new standards</i>
<i>of prudery, even for her.</i>

97
00:07:43,164 --> 00:07:45,359
Yes, miss.

98
00:07:46,868 --> 00:07:52,306
<i>Mr. Darling had been practicing</i>
<i>small talk all afternoon.</i>

99
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:55,399
I say, it's nice weather we're having.

100
00:07:55,476 --> 00:07:57,467
<i>And now his opportunity had arrived.</i>

101
00:07:57,545 --> 00:08:01,743
<i>Sir Edward Quiller Couch,</i>
<i>the president of the bank,</i>

102
00:08:01,816 --> 00:08:04,046
<i>was a man who enjoyed small talk...</i>

103
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:06,586
<i>almost as much</i>
<i>as a good balance sheet.</i>

104
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:11,057
<i>Wendy walked as one condemned.</i>

105
00:08:11,125 --> 00:08:13,787
<i>And then... fate.</i>

106
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:19,293
The letter! Wait! Stop!

107
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:21,665
Wendy, wait!
Come back!

108
00:08:23,905 --> 00:08:26,669
I say, what a splendid tie.

109
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:31,901
<i>Wait.! You there.! Stop.!</i>

110
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:35,005
<i>- Wendy.! Nana, come back.!</i>

111
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:39,019
<i>That's £200 saved.</i>
<i>Ajudicious investment?</i>

112
00:08:39,087 --> 00:08:41,851
Indeed.
Uh...

113
00:08:45,426 --> 00:08:49,760
Hi. Um...

114
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:52,129
I, uh...

115
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,398
<i>You there, stop.! Wait.!</i>

116
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:58,803
<i>Stop! Wait!</i>

117
00:08:58,873 --> 00:09:01,171
Uh, uh, uh... I, uh...

118
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:10,446
<i>I can explain.!</i>

119
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,885
No!

120
00:09:31,038 --> 00:09:33,165
<i>I have been humiliated.!</i>

121
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,175
No!

122
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:39,043
I must become a man
that children fear
and adults respect,

123
00:09:39,113 --> 00:09:41,581
or we shall all
end up in the street!

124
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,913
George, not so loud.
The neighbors will hear.

125
00:09:43,985 --> 00:09:47,716
Let them hear.
Let the whole world know!

126
00:09:47,789 --> 00:09:51,520
This is not a nurse! This is a dog.

127
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,529
Tomorrow you begin
your instruction...

128
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:03,570
<i>with Aunt Millicent.</i>

129
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:05,868
<i>It's time for you to grow up.!</i>

130
00:10:16,751 --> 00:10:19,117
<i>Mother?</i>

131
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:22,418
Can anything harm us
after the night-lights are lit?

132
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,822
No, precious.

133
00:10:24,892 --> 00:10:29,352
They are the eyes a mother
leaves behind to guard her children.

134
00:10:34,235 --> 00:10:37,068
Mother, must you go
to the party?

135
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:39,572
Please, Mother.
Yes, Mother,
you don't have to go.

136
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,574
Father can go by himself.
Please, Mother.

137
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,906
By himself?

138
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:46,708
Your father is a brave man.

139
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:50,717
But he's going to need
the special kiss to face
his colleagues tonight.

140
00:10:50,785 --> 00:10:52,912
Father? Brave?

141
00:10:55,056 --> 00:10:58,423
There are many
different kinds of bravery.

142
00:10:58,492 --> 00:11:02,428
There's the bravery of thinking
of others before oneself.

143
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:07,490
Now, your father has never
brandished a sword nor fired
a pistol, thank heavens.

144
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,304
But he's made many sacrifices
for his family...

145
00:11:13,374 --> 00:11:16,275
and put away many dreams.

146
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:19,040
Where did he put them?

147
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,377
He put them in a drawer.

148
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:26,318
And sometimes, late at night,
we take them out and admire them.

149
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:31,322
<i>But it gets harder and harder</i>
<i>to close the drawer.</i>

150
00:11:33,227 --> 00:11:35,218
He does.

151
00:11:36,797 --> 00:11:38,958
And that is why he is brave.

152
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,831
And remember, every cloud
has a silver lining.

153
00:11:44,906 --> 00:11:48,364
Oh.
Oh. No, it's snowing.

154
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,240
Oh, we'll catch our death.
Better death than gossip.

155
00:11:51,312 --> 00:11:54,941
You will enter that drawing room
with your head held high.

156
00:12:57,511 --> 00:12:59,877
Oh!

157
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,461
Shh!

158
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,961
One, two,

159
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:28,236
<i>Three!</i>

160
00:13:28,309 --> 00:13:30,903
Aha!

161
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:36,976
Come here, you!

162
00:13:37,051 --> 00:13:39,144
I got you.

163
00:13:47,862 --> 00:13:50,422
Ha!

164
00:15:03,704 --> 00:15:06,070
Boy, why are you crying?

165
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,404
You can fly!

166
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:27,258
What is your name?
What is your name?

167
00:15:27,328 --> 00:15:30,024
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.

168
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:32,429
Peter... Pan.

169
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,434
Where do you live?

170
00:15:34,502 --> 00:15:38,336
Second to the right and then
straight on till morning.

171
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:40,896
They put that on the letters?
Don't get any letters.

172
00:15:40,975 --> 00:15:43,705
But your mother gets letters.
Don't have a mother.

173
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:49,214
No wonder you were crying.
I wasn't crying
about mothers.

174
00:15:49,283 --> 00:15:53,151
I was crying because I can't
get the shadow to stick.

175
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,711
And I wasn't crying!

176
00:16:02,363 --> 00:16:05,355
I could sew it on for you.

177
00:16:14,675 --> 00:16:16,905
This may hurt a little.

178
00:16:24,451 --> 00:16:28,285
- Might I borrow your knife?

179
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,162
- Thank you.

180
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:58,351
- Oh, the cleverness of me!
- Of course, I did nothing.

181
00:16:58,419 --> 00:17:00,512
<i>Aw, you did a little.</i>
<i>A little?</i>

182
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,957
Good night.

183
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,790
Wendy?

184
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:17,966
One girl is worth more
than 20 boys.

185
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,336
<i>You really think so?</i>

186
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:24,537
I live with boys... the Lost Boys.
They are well named.

187
00:17:24,612 --> 00:17:27,103
Who are they?

188
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:29,945
Children who fall out of their prams
when the nurse is not looking.

189
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:32,645
If they are not claimed in seven days,
they are sent to the Neverland.

190
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,123
- Are there girls too?
- Girls are much too clever
to fall out of their prams.

191
00:17:37,191 --> 00:17:41,924
Peter, it is perfectly lovely
the way you talk about girls.

192
00:17:44,665 --> 00:17:47,828
I should like to give you...

193
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,835
a... kiss.

194
00:17:51,805 --> 00:17:54,535
Don't you know what a kiss is?

195
00:17:54,608 --> 00:17:56,667
I shall know when you give me one.

196
00:18:08,756 --> 00:18:10,883
I suppose
I'm to give you one now.

197
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,085
If you like.

198
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,506
Thank you.

199
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,945
How old are you, Peter?
Quite young.

200
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:44,752
- Don't you know?
- I ran away.

201
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:49,728
One night, I heard my mother
and father talking of what
I was to be when I became a man.

202
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:55,633
So I ran away to Kensington
Gardens and I met Tink.

203
00:18:55,703 --> 00:18:58,638
- Tink?
- Tinker Bell.

204
00:18:58,706 --> 00:19:00,571
She's my fairy.

205
00:19:00,641 --> 00:19:05,738
- But there's no such thing as...
- Don't say that.

206
00:19:05,813 --> 00:19:09,442
Every time somebody
says that, a fairy
somewhere falls down dead.

207
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:12,041
And I shall never find her
if she's dead.

208
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:15,850
You don't mean to tell me
there's a fairy in this room.

209
00:19:15,923 --> 00:19:18,619
<i>We come to listen</i>
<i>to the stories.</i>

210
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:22,526
I like the one about the prince
who couldn't find the lady
who wore glass slippers.

211
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:25,429
<i>Cinderella.</i>

212
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:30,801
<i>Peter, he found her</i>
<i>and they...and they...</i>

213
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,105
lived happily ever after.

214
00:19:36,176 --> 00:19:39,339
I knew it.
Peter.

215
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:44,307
I should like to give you...

216
00:19:44,385 --> 00:19:48,651
a... thimble.

217
00:19:48,722 --> 00:19:50,451
What's that?

218
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,829
<i>-</i>
<i>- Tink!</i>

219
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:06,433
<i>Tink.! Tink, no.!</i>

220
00:20:10,544 --> 00:20:13,172
She's not very polite.

221
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:17,609
<i>She says if you try to</i>
<i>give me a thimble again,</i>

222
00:20:19,853 --> 00:20:21,650
she'll kill you.
Oh.

223
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:27,558
And I had supposed fairies
to be charming.

224
00:20:27,628 --> 00:20:31,189
Peter, don't go.
I have to tell the others
about Cinderella.

225
00:20:31,265 --> 00:20:35,964
- But I know lots of stories,
stories I could tell the boys.
- Come with me.

226
00:20:36,036 --> 00:20:39,494
<i>L... I cannot fly.</i>
<i>I'll teach you.</i>

227
00:20:39,573 --> 00:20:43,771
I'll teach you to ride the wind's back.
And away we go.

228
00:20:45,712 --> 00:20:48,203
Could John and Michael come too?

229
00:20:55,989 --> 00:20:58,719
- Michael! Michael!
-

230
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:01,761
- John! John!
- I didn't do it.

231
00:21:01,829 --> 00:21:05,424
There is a boy here
who is to teach us to fly.

232
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:09,060
You offend reason, sir.

233
00:21:10,237 --> 00:21:11,829
Mm-hmm.

234
00:21:22,249 --> 00:21:23,944
I should like to
offend it with you.

235
00:21:24,017 --> 00:21:29,011
You just think happy thoughts,
and they lift you into the air.

236
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,059
It's easy.

237
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:37,528
I've got it! I've got it!

238
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:41,466
Swords, daggers, Napoleon!

239
00:21:41,535 --> 00:21:45,096
<i>-</i>
<i>Stand back.</i>
<i>- Yahoo!</i>

240
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:49,434
John!

241
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:57,746
<i>Wendy.! Wendy.! Watch me.!</i>

242
00:21:57,818 --> 00:22:02,448
Puddings, mud pies, ice cream,
never to take a bath again!

243
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:05,287
<i>Michael.!</i>

244
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:13,497
Whoa!

245
00:22:31,552 --> 00:22:35,318
Come away.
Come away to Neverland.

246
00:22:35,389 --> 00:22:37,789
Oh. What about Mother?

247
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:41,089
Father?
Nana?

248
00:22:42,896 --> 00:22:45,091
- There are mermaids.
- Mermaids?

249
00:22:45,165 --> 00:22:47,531
Indians!
Indians?

250
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:50,900
- Pirates!
- Pirates?

251
00:22:50,971 --> 00:22:53,804
Whoa-ho!

252
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:56,536
<i>John, wait for me.!</i>

253
00:23:11,358 --> 00:23:14,156
<i>May I introduce my wife...</i>

254
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:15,694
Mary?
Mary.

255
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,162
Mary.

256
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,631
<i>Delighted.</i>
<i>Thank you, Sir Edward.</i>

257
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:51,827
Forget them, Wendy.
Forget them all.

258
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:56,892
Come with me where you'll never,
never have to worry about
grown-up things again.

259
00:23:58,305 --> 00:24:01,934
What is it? What's wrong?

260
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:07,007
Never is an awfully long time.

261
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:15,746
<i>It would be delightful to report</i>
<i>that they reached the nursery in time.</i>

262
00:24:18,925 --> 00:24:20,916
<i>But then there</i>
<i>would be no story.</i>

263
00:24:41,214 --> 00:24:43,739
But you're covered
in dog hair, my darling.

264
00:24:43,817 --> 00:24:47,583
- Hello, old chap.
-  Good evening.

265
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,315
Thank you.

266
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:51,983
Whoa-ho!

267
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:55,586
Higher!

268
00:25:08,542 --> 00:25:10,635
Who are you?

269
00:25:10,711 --> 00:25:13,236
I'm John.

270
00:25:13,313 --> 00:25:15,941
John.

271
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,611
Take hold of this.
Ta-da!

272
00:25:21,421 --> 00:25:23,514
Both hands.

273
00:25:27,728 --> 00:25:30,162
Pass it on.

274
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:33,427
Michael, take hold of my ankle.

275
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,628
Wendy, take hold of my ankle!

276
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:39,968
<i>And whatever happens,</i>
<i>don't... let...</i>

<i>Cap'n?</i>

287
00:27:43,563 --> 00:27:47,863
Cap'n? As I was sitting
wide-eyed on my watch,

288
00:27:47,934 --> 00:27:51,301
I noticed it was
wintertime on the water
and springtime on the shore.

289
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:54,397
I says to meself,
"That's early for spring to be astir.

290
00:27:54,474 --> 00:27:56,635
Spring's not due till 3:00 p.m."

291
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,611
Check the time yourself,
Cap'n, and then tell...

292
00:28:09,689 --> 00:28:14,649
I was dreaming, Smee, of Pan.

293
00:28:14,728 --> 00:28:16,491
Pan, Cap'n?

294
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:19,225
And in my dream,

295
00:28:19,299 --> 00:28:22,666
I was a magnanimous fellow...

296
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:26,032
full of forgiveness.

297
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,274
I thanked Pan...

298
00:28:29,342 --> 00:28:31,435
<i>for cutting off my hand...</i>

299
00:28:31,511 --> 00:28:34,412
and for giving me
this fine hook...

300
00:28:34,481 --> 00:28:39,316
for disemboweling
and ripping throats...

301
00:28:39,386 --> 00:28:42,685
and other such homely uses...

302
00:28:42,756 --> 00:28:45,884
as combing my hair.

303
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:50,930
So, Pan did you
a favor then, Cap'n?
A favor?

304
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:56,664
He threw my hand
to a crocodile.

305
00:28:56,736 --> 00:29:00,297
The beast liked it so much,
it's followed me ever since,

306
00:29:00,373 --> 00:29:03,001
licking its lips
for the rest of me.

307
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,567
You call that a favor?

308
00:29:05,645 --> 00:29:08,011
No. No. No. No.

309
00:29:13,253 --> 00:29:17,485
Thank you.
Thank Lucifer the beast
swallowed a clock.

310
00:29:17,557 --> 00:29:21,493
<i>If it wasn't for the ticking,</i>
<i>it'd have had me by now.</i>

311
00:29:21,561 --> 00:29:26,055
Why did you wake me, Smee?

312
00:29:26,132 --> 00:29:30,159
Like I said, Cap'n,
the ice is melting.

313
00:29:30,236 --> 00:29:34,366
The sun is out.
And the flowers are all in bloom.

314
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:36,375
He's back.

315
00:29:54,027 --> 00:29:56,018
Forty gunner.

316
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,792
<i>She must do 12 knots</i>
<i>under full sail.</i>

317
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:06,595
<i>Noodler, with his hands</i>
<i>on backwards.!</i>

318
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:10,040
BillJukes!
Every inch of him tattooed.

319
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:13,608
<i>Hook.!</i>

320
00:30:18,952 --> 00:30:21,443
Let's take a closer look.

321
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:26,652
Yahoo!
Peter!

322
00:30:26,726 --> 00:30:28,853
Watch this.

323
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:31,260
Whoa-ho-ho!

324
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,334
Whoa! My hat!

325
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:37,870
Ugly Smee!
Ugly, fat Smee!

326
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:40,371
Solar eclipse.

327
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,465
<i>Dark in here.</i>
<i>Let me out. Let me out.!</i>

328
00:30:42,542 --> 00:30:45,670
<i>Can't see.</i>

329
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,737
<i>Dark in here. Candle.</i>

330
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:51,579
<i>I need candle. Help.! Help.!</i>

331
00:30:58,224 --> 00:31:00,158
Fetch Long Tom.

332
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,158
Fire!

333
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:10,760
- Help! Help!
-

334
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:24,372
Tink, find Wendy.
Leave the rest to me.

335
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:26,976
Wendy.

336
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:29,351
Oh, Captain Hook!

337
00:31:29,422 --> 00:31:31,822
Pan!

338
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:35,224
Stay with him!
You can't catch me.

339
00:31:35,295 --> 00:31:38,230
<i>Over here.!</i>
<i>Fire!</i>

340
00:31:42,068 --> 00:31:44,468
Timber!

341
00:31:44,537 --> 00:31:46,903
Whoa!

342
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,873
Michael, are you shot?

343
00:31:48,942 --> 00:31:52,343
I haven't checked yet!
But there's something worser!

344
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:54,642
Oh, what could be worse?

345
00:31:54,714 --> 00:31:59,549
My thoughts aren't very happy!

346
00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:02,247
Happy thoughts!

347
00:32:02,322 --> 00:32:05,689
<i>Happy thoughts.</i>
<i>What would Mom and Dad do?</i>

348
00:32:05,758 --> 00:32:09,694
<i>Napoleon!</i>
<i>Damnation.!</i>

349
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,890
Reload the cannon! Quickly!

350
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:16,902
<i>Reload the cannon?</i>

351
00:32:18,638 --> 00:32:21,334
Any other contributions?

352
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:24,376
Search the jungle!
Bring me those children!

353
00:32:24,577 --> 00:32:27,671
<i> What is it?</i>
<i>It's a large white bird.</i>

354
00:32:27,747 --> 00:32:30,045
Quite ugly too. No!
Give me it!

355
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:32,607
When Peter's away,
I'm in charge!

356
00:32:32,685 --> 00:32:34,915
I get to look
through the telescope.

357
00:32:34,988 --> 00:32:37,081
<i>It's coming closer.</i>

358
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:40,684
My God, I've gone blind!

359
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,785
I'm blind. I've gone blind.
I'm blind.

360
00:32:42,862 --> 00:32:45,092
Hello, Tink. Where's Peter?

361
00:32:45,165 --> 00:32:47,360
Hello, Tink.
She's blinded me!

362
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,367
Hello, Tink.
Hello, Tink.

363
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:53,132
- Any more news of Cinderella?

364
00:32:55,708 --> 00:32:58,074
<i>Now, Tinker Bell was not all bad.</i>

365
00:32:58,144 --> 00:33:00,578
<i>Sometimes she was all good.</i>

366
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:04,014
<i>But fairies are so small they only</i>
<i>have room for one feeling at a time.</i>

367
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:08,349
Tink says the bird's
called a..."Wendy."

368
00:33:08,421 --> 00:33:11,549
And Peter wants us to...

369
00:33:16,129 --> 00:33:18,393
Oh, Peter! Oh!

370
00:33:18,464 --> 00:33:20,796
Shoot it down.

371
00:33:23,436 --> 00:33:26,234
Well, we have our orders.
Shoot the Wendy bird.

372
00:33:26,306 --> 00:33:28,331
Aye, aye!

373
00:33:28,408 --> 00:33:30,740
Ready? Aim!

374
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:33,472
- Fire!

375
00:33:33,546 --> 00:33:35,673
Bye-bye!

376
00:33:35,748 --> 00:33:38,342
<i>Three, two,</i>

377
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,579
<i>one.!</i>

378
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:49,193
I got it. I got it!

379
00:34:03,476 --> 00:34:05,706
That is no bird.

380
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:11,015
It is a lady.
And Tootles...

381
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:13,678
Tootles has killed her.

382
00:34:13,753 --> 00:34:17,621
Ha! I'm back! Great news.
I know what happened
to Cinderella.

383
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:22,559
She defeated the pirates.
There was stabbing, slicing,
torturing, bleeding...

384
00:34:22,629 --> 00:34:25,063
<i>and they lived happily ever after.</i>

385
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:28,999
<i>Well, that's a relief,</i>
<i>I must say.</i>
<i>Greater news.!</i>

386
00:34:29,068 --> 00:34:32,868
I have brought you she
that told of Cinderella.
She is to tell us stories!

387
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:35,203
She is...

388
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:39,742
Dead.

389
00:34:39,812 --> 00:34:41,837
Tragic.

390
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,212
Awful.
Good shot, though.

391
00:34:47,287 --> 00:34:50,415
Whose arrow?

392
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,358
Mine, Peter.

393
00:35:03,569 --> 00:35:05,503
Strike, Peter.

394
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:07,596
<i>Strike true.</i>

395
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:16,874
- The Wendy lives!
-

396
00:35:27,126 --> 00:35:29,890
It's my kiss.

397
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:32,430
My kiss saved her.

398
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:35,262
I remember kisses.

399
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,326
Let me see it.

400
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:42,801
Aye, that is a kiss.
A powerful thing.

401
00:35:42,875 --> 00:35:46,140
Let us carry her down
to the house.

402
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:48,373
Hands.

403
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,284
They're a bit dirty.

404
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:54,377
<i>She must stay here and die.</i>

405
00:35:54,454 --> 00:35:57,423
No!
Oh, how could I have
thought that? Stupid.

406
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,424
Sorry.

407
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:04,262
We shall build
a house around her.

408
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:06,491
With a chimney!

409
00:36:06,566 --> 00:36:09,399
And a door knocker!
And windows!

410
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:18,434
Tink did it.

411
00:36:25,017 --> 00:36:28,453
<i>Tinker Bell?</i>
<i>Oh, Tinker Bell?</i>

412
00:36:33,593 --> 00:36:37,689
- Was it you, Tink?
- Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

413
00:36:42,602 --> 00:36:46,060
Then I am your friend no more.

414
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,097
<i>First impressions</i>
<i>are very, very important.</i>

415
00:37:18,171 --> 00:37:20,662
<i>Here she is.</i>
<i>Look loveable.</i>

416
00:37:23,443 --> 00:37:28,540
<i>Wendy lady, for you we built</i>
<i>this house with a door knocker.</i>

417
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:30,878
And a chimney.
One, two, three.

418
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,714
Please be our mother.

419
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,848
Oh.

420
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:42,292
Well, it is frightfully fascinating.

421
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:45,194
But, you see,
I've had no real experience.

422
00:37:46,532 --> 00:37:49,262
Do you tell stories?
Yes.

423
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:52,429
Then you're perfect.
Very well.

424
00:37:52,505 --> 00:37:55,531
- I will do my best.
- Hooray!

425
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:59,203
Sorry about the blindfold.

426
00:37:59,278 --> 00:38:02,145
We must be cautious.
There are some nasty
characters about.

427
00:38:02,215 --> 00:38:04,445
If Hook discovers our hideout,
he'll gut us.

428
00:38:04,517 --> 00:38:07,782
How dreadful!
Oh, we live for it!

429
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,120
But l...
Time to meet Father, Mother.

430
00:38:15,895 --> 00:38:19,023
So looking forward
to being your son.

431
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,399
Welcome, Mother.

432
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:32,171
Discipline. That's what
fathers believe in.

433
00:38:32,245 --> 00:38:36,841
You must spank the children immediately
before they try to kill you again.

434
00:38:36,916 --> 00:38:39,544
In fact, we should kill them.

435
00:38:45,157 --> 00:38:47,523
Peter!

436
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:49,652
Father!

437
00:38:49,729 --> 00:38:53,028
I agree that they
are perfectly horrid,

438
00:38:53,099 --> 00:38:57,297
but kill them
and they shall think
themselves important.

439
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:59,736
So important.
And unique.

440
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:03,673
I suggest something...

441
00:39:03,743 --> 00:39:06,041
far more dreadful.

442
00:39:08,981 --> 00:39:10,915
Medicine.

443
00:39:10,983 --> 00:39:14,180
It's the most beastly,
disgusting stuff.

444
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:19,588
The sticky, sweet kind.

445
00:39:19,659 --> 00:39:22,355
Kill us, please!
Kill us, please!

446
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:25,454
Littlest first. Michael?

447
00:39:27,033 --> 00:39:31,834
- Michael. John. My brothers!
- Who?

448
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:53,015
Hello?

449
00:39:53,092 --> 00:39:55,856
<i>Hello? Hello? Hello?</i>

450
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:07,598
It's louder from inside
this rock.

451
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,903
How very peculiar.

452
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:28,487
<i>Happy thoughts.!</i>
<i>Swords, daggers, Napoleon.!</i>

453
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:33,724
How humiliating.

454
00:40:35,801 --> 00:40:39,862
John, there's something worser.

455
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:57,048
<i>Princess Tiger Lily.</i>

456
00:41:00,393 --> 00:41:04,022
<i>We search as ever for Peter Pan...</i>

457
00:41:04,096 --> 00:41:06,530
and his secret hideout.

458
00:41:08,134 --> 00:41:10,068
Luckily, two boys
of his acquaintance...

459
00:41:10,136 --> 00:41:13,572
<i>were seen falling</i>
<i>into this part of thejungle.</i>

460
00:41:14,807 --> 00:41:16,741
Have you seen them?

461
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,590
She says,
"Sorry, but, no."

462
00:41:37,530 --> 00:41:42,058
My Hook thinks
you have, Princess.

463
00:41:42,134 --> 00:41:45,763
I say, unhand that savage, you...

464
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:49,274
<i>you...you savage.!</i>

465
00:41:50,776 --> 00:41:54,075
<i>Now, mermaids are not</i>
<i>as they are in storybooks.</i>

466
00:41:54,146 --> 00:41:56,478
<i>They are dark creatures...</i>

467
00:41:56,549 --> 00:42:00,280
<i>in touch with all things mysterious.</i>

468
00:42:01,654 --> 00:42:04,418
<i>If Hook had captured</i>
<i>Wendy's brothers,</i>

469
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:07,288
<i>the mermaids would know.</i>

470
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:09,327
Oh, how sweet.

471
00:42:12,531 --> 00:42:15,762
Are mermaids not sweet?

472
00:42:15,835 --> 00:42:17,996
They'll sweetly drown you
if you get too close.

473
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,401
Hook has your brothers
at the Black Castle.

474
00:43:18,664 --> 00:43:21,827
Like all surprise attacks,
it must be conducted...

475
00:43:23,169 --> 00:43:24,727
improperly.

476
00:43:24,804 --> 00:43:27,068
<i>Put the children on the rock.</i>

477
00:43:31,744 --> 00:43:35,236
Sorry, Your Highness.
Any last words?

478
00:43:35,314 --> 00:43:37,942
Beg for your lives.

479
00:43:38,017 --> 00:43:42,818
Sirs! My brother and I
are English gentlemen.

480
00:43:42,888 --> 00:43:45,584
English gentlemen do not beg.

481
00:43:45,658 --> 00:43:48,525
Please!

482
00:43:48,594 --> 00:43:51,586
Please! Please!
Please don't kill us!

483
00:43:51,664 --> 00:43:54,929
Please don't kill me, either.
I've never done anything...

484
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,834
Aah! It's cold! It's cold!

485
00:44:00,506 --> 00:44:03,634
<i>Help.!</i>
<i>Come on. Fly to the rescue,</i>

486
00:44:03,709 --> 00:44:08,043
and then I'll shoot you right
through your noble intentions.

487
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,642
I brought these.
Can you use it?

488
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:29,665
Promise me one thing.
Leave Hook to me.

489
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:31,999
I promise.

490
00:44:32,071 --> 00:44:35,871
- Wait here for my signal.
- Wait here?

491
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:38,409
<i>Peter.!</i>

492
00:44:52,524 --> 00:44:57,928
<i>Thus Wendy first laid eyes on</i>
<i>the dark figure who haunted her stories.</i>

493
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:01,797
<i>She saw the piercing eyes</i>
<i>and was not afraid,</i>

494
00:45:01,867 --> 00:45:04,358
<i>but entranced.</i>

495
00:45:08,908 --> 00:45:12,537
<i>Mr. Smee?</i>

496
00:45:12,611 --> 00:45:15,671
<i>That you, Cap'n?</i>
<i>Brimstone and gall, man.</i>

497
00:45:15,748 --> 00:45:18,546
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

498
00:45:18,617 --> 00:45:21,586
Well, we've put the children
on the rope, Cap'n, like you said.

499
00:45:21,654 --> 00:45:25,317
<i>Set 'em free.!</i>
<i>Set 'em free?</i>

500
00:45:25,391 --> 00:45:30,294
- Well, what about your trap?
- Set them free, or
I'll plunge my hook in you.

501
00:45:49,982 --> 00:45:53,577
I don't know what he wants with 'em.
I'm just a blithering idiot, aren't I?

502
00:45:53,652 --> 00:45:57,816
Chain 'em up. Let 'em go.

503
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:01,223
<i>- And take your cat with ya.</i>

504
00:46:10,869 --> 00:46:13,269
<i>Mr. Smee?</i>
<i>Aye, Cap'n?</i>

505
00:46:13,339 --> 00:46:16,035
- Any sign of him?
- No, Cap'n.

506
00:46:17,042 --> 00:46:19,340
Where are the children?

507
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:21,902
It's all right, Cap'n.
We let 'em go.

508
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:24,074
You what?

509
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,117
We let 'em go.

510
00:46:37,763 --> 00:46:42,097
You... let... them... go.

511
00:46:56,315 --> 00:46:59,113
Who are you, stranger?

512
00:46:59,184 --> 00:47:03,086
<i>I am James Hook,</i>
<i>captain of the Jolly Roger.</i>

513
00:47:03,155 --> 00:47:07,751
If you are Hook,
then who am I?

514
00:47:07,826 --> 00:47:10,659
You are a codfish.

515
00:47:15,234 --> 00:47:20,069
<i>Tell me, Hook,</i>
<i>have you another name?</i>

516
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,572
Aye.

517
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:26,739
- Vegetable?
- No.

518
00:47:26,812 --> 00:47:28,803
- Mineral?
- No.

519
00:47:28,881 --> 00:47:31,611
<i>Animal?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

520
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,982
- Man?
- No!

521
00:47:35,054 --> 00:47:37,614
- Boy?
- Yes!

522
00:47:37,689 --> 00:47:40,089
<i>- Ordinary boy?</i>
<i>- No!</i>

523
00:47:40,159 --> 00:47:43,651
<i>- Wonderful boy?</i>
<i>- Yes.! Do you give up?</i>

524
00:47:43,729 --> 00:47:45,754
- Yes!
- I am...

525
00:47:45,831 --> 00:47:48,925
- History.
- Peter, look out!

526
00:47:56,909 --> 00:47:59,139
There he is!

527
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:02,146
It is your requiem mass, boy.

528
00:48:05,617 --> 00:48:09,678
Ready to lose the other one?
Not this time.

529
00:48:24,703 --> 00:48:28,332
Ooh-ooh, girlie.

530
00:48:28,407 --> 00:48:32,707
<i>Who be you to call me girlie?</i>

531
00:48:37,316 --> 00:48:40,149
- Ow.

532
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:43,086
<i>Open the gate.!</i>

533
00:48:45,958 --> 00:48:47,892
<i>Teddy.!</i>

534
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:58,502
Ew.

535
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:02,869
Oh.

536
00:49:19,525 --> 00:49:22,016
If I were you, I'd give up.

537
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:25,188
If you were me, I'd be ugly.

538
00:49:33,805 --> 00:49:36,535
No!

539
00:49:36,608 --> 00:49:38,576
Ready?

540
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:41,112
Fire!

541
00:49:53,926 --> 00:49:56,759
<i>Get the boat!</i>

542
00:50:19,585 --> 00:50:22,486
Turn the boat around.

543
00:50:22,554 --> 00:50:24,488
Turn it around!

544
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
And now, Peter Pan,

545
00:50:36,602 --> 00:50:39,268
you shall die.

546
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,278
To die will be
an awfully big adventure.

547
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,344
<i>Oh, no.</i>

548
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:22,945
You.

549
00:51:33,592 --> 00:51:35,355
Smee!

550
00:51:37,129 --> 00:51:40,621
<i>Smee.!</i>

551
00:51:40,699 --> 00:51:42,826
It's all a bit tragic,
really, isn't it?

552
00:52:04,657 --> 00:52:06,682
<i>The warrior is wounded.</i>

553
00:52:06,759 --> 00:52:11,560
She is calling forth
the spirit of the eagle
to heal the warrior.

554
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:13,564
It's so impressive.

555
00:52:16,135 --> 00:52:18,603
The warrior is healed.

556
00:52:45,164 --> 00:52:47,962
Peter?
Shh.

557
00:52:52,104 --> 00:52:54,368
Peter?

558
00:54:59,131 --> 00:55:01,122
Evil day.

559
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:11,974
He has found himself a...

560
00:55:17,649 --> 00:55:19,640
Wendy?

561
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:24,322
<i>And Hook is all alone.</i>

562
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:28,087
Me too.
You too?

563
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,822
Banished? Tsk, tsk.
The dog.

564
00:55:36,568 --> 00:55:40,595
I think you and I...

565
00:55:43,876 --> 00:55:46,003
should talk.

566
00:55:52,084 --> 00:55:54,018
Wendy?

567
00:55:54,086 --> 00:55:57,715
It's only make-believe,
isn't it?

568
00:55:59,224 --> 00:56:02,421
That you and I are...

569
00:56:04,263 --> 00:56:06,925
Oh. Yes.

570
00:56:09,768 --> 00:56:11,633
Wendy?

571
00:56:13,772 --> 00:56:17,469
You see, it would make me seem
so old to be a real father.

572
00:56:21,513 --> 00:56:23,504
Peter,

573
00:56:24,783 --> 00:56:28,776
what are your real feelings?
Feelings?

574
00:56:28,854 --> 00:56:30,981
What do you feel?

575
00:56:31,056 --> 00:56:34,685
Happiness? Sadness?

576
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,955
Jealousy?
Jealousy?

577
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:39,623
Tink!
Anger?

578
00:56:39,698 --> 00:56:41,723
- Anger.

579
00:56:45,104 --> 00:56:47,095
Hook.

580
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:50,474
Love?

581
00:56:53,212 --> 00:56:55,874
- Love?
- Love.

582
00:56:55,948 --> 00:56:58,416
I have never heard of it.

583
00:56:58,484 --> 00:57:01,715
I think you have, Peter.

584
00:57:01,787 --> 00:57:04,187
I daresay you've
felt it yourself...

585
00:57:04,256 --> 00:57:08,056
for something or... someone.

586
00:57:11,864 --> 00:57:16,233
Never. Even the sound
of it offends me.

587
00:57:16,301 --> 00:57:18,531
Peter.

588
00:57:18,604 --> 00:57:22,404
<i>Why do you spoil everything?</i>
<i>We have fun, don't we?</i>

589
00:57:22,474 --> 00:57:26,433
I taught you to fight and to fly.
What more could there be?

590
00:57:26,512 --> 00:57:30,710
There is so much more.
What? What else is there?

591
00:57:30,782 --> 00:57:35,276
I don't know.
I think it becomes clearer
when you grow up.

592
00:57:35,354 --> 00:57:38,187
Well, I will not grow up!
You cannot make me!

593
00:57:38,257 --> 00:57:41,124
I will banish you like Tinker Bell!
I will not be banished!

594
00:57:41,193 --> 00:57:43,957
Then go home.
Go home and grow up.

595
00:57:44,029 --> 00:57:47,123
And take your feelings
with you!
Peter!

596
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,531
Peter, come back! Peter!

597
00:58:09,888 --> 00:58:12,356
<i>Peter did not want Wendy to leave.</i>

598
00:58:13,392 --> 00:58:15,952
<i>Once again,</i>
<i>he visited Wendy's home...</i>

599
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:19,759
<i>to see if Mr. And Mrs. Darling</i>
<i>had closed the window yet.</i>

600
00:58:22,301 --> 00:58:26,203
<i>But, as before, he saw</i>
<i>Mrs. Darling in her chair...</i>

601
00:58:26,271 --> 00:58:30,332
<i>by the window, her eyes tired</i>
<i>with searching the heavens.</i>

602
00:58:31,343 --> 00:58:33,402
<i>Wendy.</i>

603
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:37,507
Wendy.

604
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:39,517
<i>Wendy.</i>

605
00:58:43,956 --> 00:58:46,356
We can't both have her, lady.

606
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:04,898
John! Michael!

607
00:59:04,977 --> 00:59:07,502
Wendy!

608
00:59:07,579 --> 00:59:10,173
The window's closed.

609
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:14,880
<i>- George! George, help me!</i>
<i>- What is it? Have they returned?</i>

610
00:59:14,953 --> 00:59:19,413
The window is closed.
It must always be open for them.

611
00:59:19,491 --> 00:59:22,892
<i>- Always. Always.</i>

612
00:59:33,538 --> 00:59:35,699
They've not returned.

613
01:00:11,843 --> 01:00:14,903
<i>**</i>
<i>*Avast belay the English brig *</i>

621
01:00:46,345 --> 01:00:49,610
Wendy, darling.

622
01:00:53,819 --> 01:00:55,912
Muscat, miss?

623
01:00:55,987 --> 01:00:58,080
I'm a little girl.

624
01:00:58,156 --> 01:01:00,090
Rum, then?

625
01:01:00,158 --> 01:01:02,649
No, thank you.

626
01:01:02,728 --> 01:01:05,720
I'm told you ran away from home.

627
01:01:05,797 --> 01:01:10,530
L... I had never
thought of it that way.

628
01:01:12,904 --> 01:01:15,395
<i>I suppose I did.</i>

629
01:01:15,474 --> 01:01:17,374
How wonderful.

630
01:01:17,442 --> 01:01:21,845
<i>My parents wanted me to grow up.</i>

631
01:01:21,913 --> 01:01:25,747
Growing up is such
a barbarous business,

632
01:01:25,817 --> 01:01:29,344
full of inconvenience
and pimples.

633
01:01:29,421 --> 01:01:31,889
Things were simpler
when I was younger.

634
01:01:31,957 --> 01:01:35,484
And then the mess starts,
the feelings come.

635
01:01:37,362 --> 01:01:40,889
Pan is so lucky
to be untroubled by them.

636
01:01:45,604 --> 01:01:47,765
Oh, no. He cannot love.

637
01:01:49,107 --> 01:01:51,507
<i>It's part of the riddle</i>
<i>ofhis being.</i>

638
01:01:53,145 --> 01:01:55,204
Cigar?

639
01:02:00,385 --> 01:02:04,378
Oh, there, there.

640
01:02:04,456 --> 01:02:07,357
Shh, shh, shh.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

641
01:02:09,127 --> 01:02:11,652
It doesn't
have to be this way.

642
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:19,937
Didst thou ever want to be
a pirate, my hearty?

643
01:02:22,040 --> 01:02:25,976
I once thought
of calling myself...

644
01:02:26,044 --> 01:02:29,605
Mm?
Red-Handed Jill.

645
01:02:29,681 --> 01:02:32,844
Oh, what a marvelous name!

646
01:02:32,918 --> 01:02:35,216
That's what we'll call you
if you join us.

647
01:02:35,287 --> 01:02:40,657
But what would my duties be?
I could not be expected to pillage.

648
01:02:40,725 --> 01:02:45,788
Do you, um, by any chance,
tell stories?

649
01:02:45,864 --> 01:02:48,662
<i>And they all lived happily...</i>

650
01:02:48,733 --> 01:02:52,567
<i>ever... after.</i>

651
01:02:54,372 --> 01:02:56,272
Bravo!

652
01:02:56,341 --> 01:02:58,832
<i>Bravissimo.!</i>

653
01:03:02,147 --> 01:03:06,607
Might I have time
to consider your generous offer?

654
01:03:06,685 --> 01:03:09,882
Absolutely.
Of course, you must.

655
01:03:09,955 --> 01:03:13,288
My fellows will return you
whence they found you.

656
01:03:13,358 --> 01:03:18,762
None of my crew will follow you.
I swear it.

657
01:03:18,830 --> 01:03:22,459
My new obsession is you,

658
01:03:22,534 --> 01:03:27,164
not dear Peter Pan
or his whereabouts.

659
01:03:29,641 --> 01:03:33,202
What would Mother think
of my becoming a pirate?

660
01:03:33,278 --> 01:03:35,940
Until we meet again.

661
01:03:57,969 --> 01:04:01,735
<i>What would Mother think</i>
<i>if she became a pirate?</i>

662
01:04:01,806 --> 01:04:06,300
<i>But the more Wendy</i>
<i>thought ofher mother,</i>
<i>the less she could remember.</i>

663
01:04:06,378 --> 01:04:09,006
- John.
- I wasn't doing anything!

664
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,378
- John!
- Yes?

665
01:04:11,449 --> 01:04:14,179
What is your father's name?

666
01:04:14,252 --> 01:04:17,221
My father's name? Peter.

667
01:04:17,289 --> 01:04:19,223
Father!
Yea, Peter!

668
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:21,555
Michael, who is your mother?

669
01:04:21,626 --> 01:04:25,824
- Well, he got the easy one.
- You are my mother, Wendy.

670
01:04:25,897 --> 01:04:28,525
And isn't she just first-class?

671
01:04:28,600 --> 01:04:32,798
<i>There's a new pirate</i>
<i>aboard the Jolly Roger.</i>

672
01:04:32,871 --> 01:04:36,739
The mermaids say she
is called Red-Handed Jill.

673
01:04:36,808 --> 01:04:39,333
Another adventure, boys.
Come on!

674
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:42,847
Red-Handed Jill?
She sounds quite fearsome!

675
01:04:42,914 --> 01:04:45,883
<i>Fearsome?</i>
<i>She's just a storyteller.</i>

676
01:04:45,951 --> 01:04:48,044
Just a storyteller?

677
01:04:49,754 --> 01:04:52,746
Red-Handed Jill
may be a brave swordsman.

678
01:04:52,824 --> 01:04:55,554
A girl like her?

679
01:04:55,627 --> 01:04:59,393
Brave or not,
I shall run her through!

680
01:05:04,703 --> 01:05:07,331
Then ready yourself, Peter Pan,

681
01:05:07,405 --> 01:05:10,135
for I am Red-Handed Jill.

682
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:12,142
Mother!
Wendy?

683
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:14,178
'Tis true, John.

684
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:18,079
Your sister has been
invited to piracy.

685
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,747
<i>But, Mother, Hook is a fiend.</i>

686
01:05:23,822 --> 01:05:27,121
- And a bounder.
- On the contrary,

687
01:05:27,192 --> 01:05:30,958
I find Captain Hook
to be a man of feeling.

688
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:38,158
Mother and Father
are fighting again.

689
01:05:38,236 --> 01:05:42,570
Sir, you are both
ungallant and deficient.

690
01:05:42,641 --> 01:05:44,734
How am I deficient?

691
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:47,901
You're just a boy.

692
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:54,950
Are you really to be a pirate, Mother?

693
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:56,783
No.

694
01:05:58,590 --> 01:06:00,649
We are going home.

695
01:06:00,725 --> 01:06:02,420
<i>Home?</i>

696
01:06:02,494 --> 01:06:05,486
<i>- Leave Neverland?</i>

697
01:06:08,433 --> 01:06:11,334
We must.

698
01:06:11,403 --> 01:06:13,667
We have forgotten
our parents.

699
01:06:13,738 --> 01:06:17,538
<i>We must leave at once</i>
<i>before we...</i>

700
01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:19,702
in turn are forgotten.

701
01:06:24,616 --> 01:06:29,019
I've forgotten... my parents.

702
01:06:29,087 --> 01:06:31,647
<i>We must leave.</i>

703
01:06:33,958 --> 01:06:36,051
If you wish it.

704
01:06:36,127 --> 01:06:40,063
- "If you wish it"?
- If you wish it!

705
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:02,147
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
Kill! Kill! Kill!

706
01:07:06,124 --> 01:07:10,993
Don't fret, my dear.
With Pan dead,

707
01:07:11,062 --> 01:07:14,259
we'll both be free.

708
01:07:16,835 --> 01:07:19,770
I have arranged a fairy guide
to lead you back.

709
01:07:19,838 --> 01:07:21,772
Peter,

710
01:07:23,475 --> 01:07:25,875
we've been talking.

711
01:07:27,412 --> 01:07:29,505
What if you
came back with us?

712
01:07:29,581 --> 01:07:31,515
<i>Can we go, Peter?</i>

713
01:07:31,583 --> 01:07:33,949
<i>Please, Peter, can we go?</i>
<i>If you wish it.</i>

714
01:07:34,018 --> 01:07:35,952
Get your things.

715
01:07:43,228 --> 01:07:45,696
You too, Peter.

716
01:07:45,764 --> 01:07:48,927
Would they send me to school?

717
01:07:53,104 --> 01:07:56,631
Yes.
Then... to an office?

718
01:07:56,708 --> 01:07:58,869
I suppose so.

719
01:08:00,512 --> 01:08:02,571
Soon I should be a man.

720
01:08:05,283 --> 01:08:08,411
- You can't catch me
and make me a man.
- Peter.

721
01:08:12,457 --> 01:08:17,656
I want always
to be a boy and have fun.

722
01:08:17,729 --> 01:08:22,098
You say so, but I think
it is your biggest pretend.

723
01:08:47,225 --> 01:08:51,184
Oh! Ooh. Ooh-la-la!

724
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,178
Bye-bye!

725
01:09:18,289 --> 01:09:20,883
There's no such thing
as fairies.

726
01:09:38,776 --> 01:09:41,574
Don't forget your medicine.

727
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,532
-
- Surprise.

728
01:10:21,986 --> 01:10:26,423
A new era begins.

729
01:10:26,491 --> 01:10:28,891
Take them away.

730
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:45,234
<i>No medicine.</i>
<i>I don't wanna take medicine.</i>

731
01:10:53,384 --> 01:10:56,547
No.

732
01:11:19,277 --> 01:11:21,745
<i>Lest he should be taken alive,</i>

733
01:11:21,813 --> 01:11:26,147
<i>Hook always carried upon</i>
<i>his person a dreadful poison...</i>

734
01:11:26,217 --> 01:11:29,778
<i>distilled when he was weeping</i>
<i>from the red ofhis eye.</i>

735
01:11:31,389 --> 01:11:33,323
No.

736
01:11:33,391 --> 01:11:38,328
<i>A mixture of malice,</i>
<i>jealousy and disappointment,</i>

737
01:11:38,396 --> 01:11:41,957
<i>it was instantly fatal</i>
<i>and without antidote.</i>

738
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,604
I was not asleep!

739
01:11:50,942 --> 01:11:52,876
Wendy?

740
01:11:52,944 --> 01:11:55,913
<i>Wendy? Are you there?</i>

741
01:12:26,077 --> 01:12:28,011
Tink.

742
01:12:37,088 --> 01:12:40,353
You drank my medicine.

743
01:12:44,162 --> 01:12:47,097
Tinker Bell?

744
01:12:47,165 --> 01:12:49,395
Tink?

745
01:12:49,467 --> 01:12:52,095
Why is your light going out?

746
01:12:54,639 --> 01:12:57,938
Tink, why are you so cold?

747
01:12:58,009 --> 01:13:02,036
Stay warm, Tink.
Stay warm.

748
01:13:24,902 --> 01:13:27,564
Please come back.

749
01:13:27,638 --> 01:13:30,869
Please, Tink, don't leave me.

750
01:13:30,942 --> 01:13:33,672
Forgive me, Tink.
I'm so sorry.

751
01:13:33,744 --> 01:13:36,907
I'm so sorry, Tink.
Please forgive me.

752
01:13:36,981 --> 01:13:40,747
<i>Tink!</i>

753
01:14:04,175 --> 01:14:07,042
There's still room for a storyteller.

754
01:14:08,412 --> 01:14:10,471
I'd rather die.

755
01:14:11,916 --> 01:14:16,012
Shame.
Cap'n, Cap'n.
Look at the sky.

756
01:14:16,087 --> 01:14:19,181
<i>- And look at the water.</i>

757
01:14:30,034 --> 01:14:31,968
Pan must be dead.

758
01:14:32,036 --> 01:14:35,335
No! No! Impossible!

759
01:14:43,014 --> 01:14:46,609
Ship's company, hats off!

760
01:14:46,684 --> 01:14:50,313
A moment's silence
for our fallen enemy,

761
01:14:50,388 --> 01:14:52,413
<i>Peter Pan.</i>

01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:54,641
I do believe in fairies!
I do! I do!

795
01:16:54,712 --> 01:16:59,240
I do believe in fairies.
I do. I do.

796
01:16:59,317 --> 01:17:02,946
- I do believe in fairies.
- I do! I do!

797
01:17:03,020 --> 01:17:06,683
- I do believe in fairies.
- I do believe in fairies!

798
01:17:06,757 --> 01:17:09,988
- I do believe in fairies.
- I do believe in fairies.

799
01:17:10,061 --> 01:17:13,155
- I do believe in fairies!
- I do believe in fairies!

800
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:15,698
L...

801
01:17:17,435 --> 01:17:21,269
Oh, Tink, you're alive!
Oh, Tink!

802
01:17:21,339 --> 01:17:25,537
You're alive! You're alive!

803
01:17:25,609 --> 01:17:30,171
<i>I do believe in fairies.!</i>
<i>I do.! I do.!</i>

804
01:17:30,247 --> 01:17:33,876
<i>I do believe in fairies.!</i>
<i>I do.! I do.!</i>

805
01:17:33,951 --> 01:17:37,717
<i>I do believe in fairies.! I do.! I do.!</i>

806
01:17:37,788 --> 01:17:42,487
<i>- I do believe in fairies.! I do.! I do.!</i>
<i>- He's alive!</i>

807
01:17:44,762 --> 01:17:47,993
Oh, help.
It's Hook or me this time.

808
01:17:50,935 --> 01:17:53,301
Why is he? What is he?

809
01:17:53,371 --> 01:17:55,566
<i>I'll have one last story</i>
<i>before you die.</i>

810
01:17:55,639 --> 01:17:57,573
<i>The story of Peter Pan.</i>

811
01:17:59,744 --> 01:18:02,235
Once upon a time...
Once upon a time...

812
01:18:02,313 --> 01:18:06,716
Brutes, Red-Handed Jill
is gonna tell us a story.

813
01:18:06,784 --> 01:18:09,582
There was a boy
named Peter Pan...

814
01:18:09,653 --> 01:18:12,417
<i>who decided</i>
<i>not to grow up.</i>

815
01:18:12,490 --> 01:18:15,891
Skip the prologue.

816
01:18:15,960 --> 01:18:20,363
So he flew away
to the Neverland
where the pirates are.

817
01:18:20,431 --> 01:18:23,161
Was one of them pirates
called Noodler?

818
01:18:23,234 --> 01:18:25,759
- Yes.
- Captain, did you hear?

819
01:18:25,836 --> 01:18:29,567
- I am in a story.

820
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,235
What fun he must have had.

821
01:18:33,310 --> 01:18:35,244
Yes.

822
01:18:35,312 --> 01:18:38,679
But he was rather lonely.

823
01:18:38,749 --> 01:18:41,650
Lonely?

824
01:18:41,719 --> 01:18:43,778
He needed a Wendy.

825
01:18:43,854 --> 01:18:46,755
<i>- I need a Wendy.</i>

826
01:18:46,824 --> 01:18:48,917
Very exciting.
Two dead already.

827
01:18:48,993 --> 01:18:52,929
Why a Wendy?
He liked my stories.

828
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:56,626
<i>What stories?</i>
<i>Cinderella.</i>

829
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:00,636
<i>Snow White. Sleeping Beauty.</i>

830
01:19:00,704 --> 01:19:02,934
- Love stories?

831
01:19:03,007 --> 01:19:06,704
Adventures in which good
triumphs over evil.

832
01:19:06,777 --> 01:19:10,235
-
- They all end in a kiss.

833
01:19:15,986 --> 01:19:17,920
A kiss.

834
01:19:19,990 --> 01:19:23,391
He does feel.

835
01:19:25,029 --> 01:19:27,327
He feels about you.

836
01:19:30,868 --> 01:19:34,736
She told him stories.
He taught her to fly.

837
01:19:34,805 --> 01:19:37,569
- How?

838
01:19:37,641 --> 01:19:41,099
You just think happy thoughts.
They lift you into the air.

839
01:19:41,178 --> 01:19:45,444
Alas, I have no happy thoughts.
That brings you down.

840
01:19:45,516 --> 01:19:49,509
- How else?

841
01:19:49,587 --> 01:19:51,179
<i>- No!</i>
<i>- Leave her alone.!</i>

842
01:19:51,255 --> 01:19:53,917
It's fairy dust.
You need fairy dust!

843
01:19:53,991 --> 01:19:56,755
<i>Michael.!</i>

844
01:19:56,827 --> 01:19:59,921
What of Pan?

845
01:19:59,997 --> 01:20:02,591
Will unhappy thoughts
bring him down?

846
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:04,600
He has no unhappy thoughts.

847
01:20:04,668 --> 01:20:06,795
Aw.

848
01:20:06,871 --> 01:20:10,432
How if his Wendy
walks the plank!

849
01:20:12,910 --> 01:20:14,639
<i>Plank.! Plank.! Plank.! Plank.!</i>
<i>Plank.! Plank.! Plank.! Plank.!</i>

850
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:20,113
Plank! Plank! Plank! Plank!
Plank! Plank! Plank! Plank!

851
01:20:20,184 --> 01:20:23,642
Plank! Plank! Plank! Plank!
Plank, plank, plank!

852
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:30,952
<i>You know, I really am</i>
<i>terribly sorry about this.</i>

853
01:20:37,701 --> 01:20:42,832
The irony.
It comes for Hook...

854
01:20:42,907 --> 01:20:45,398
and gets a story.

855
01:20:45,476 --> 01:20:48,036
- No!

856
01:20:50,814 --> 01:20:54,147
-
- No!

857
01:21:00,457 --> 01:21:03,392
Did you hear her
hit the water?

858
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:05,394
Because I didn't.

859
01:21:08,432 --> 01:21:10,525
<i>The beast has swallowed her whole.</i>

860
01:21:10,601 --> 01:21:14,230
Hmm.

861
01:21:14,305 --> 01:21:19,072
- Starboard side!

862
01:21:19,143 --> 01:21:24,012
- It looks for more, Captain.
- Then let's give it more.

863
01:21:24,081 --> 01:21:26,914
To the plank!

864
01:21:26,984 --> 01:21:31,284
- Silence, puling spawn!

865
01:21:31,355 --> 01:21:35,121
I'll show you the road
to dusty death.

866
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:44,534
Huh?

867
01:21:52,209 --> 01:21:54,609
- Into the rigging with you!

868
01:21:54,678 --> 01:21:58,614
Hunt it down!
Move, you scabs!

869
01:22:40,357 --> 01:22:42,291
What was that?

870
01:23:13,424 --> 01:23:16,723
<i>It's here, Captain.! Devil.! Demon.!</i>

871
01:23:16,794 --> 01:23:20,389
<i>Accursed beast.!</i>
<i>Your time is up.!</i>

872
01:23:20,464 --> 01:23:22,898
Hello.

873
01:23:31,575 --> 01:23:35,341
<i>So, Peter Pan.</i>

874
01:23:39,316 --> 01:23:41,250
This is all your doing.

875
01:23:41,318 --> 01:23:45,812
Aye, James Hook.
It's all my doing.

876
01:23:47,958 --> 01:23:50,984
Proud and insolent youth,

877
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:55,860
prepare to meet thy doom.

878
01:23:55,933 --> 01:23:58,561
Have at thee!

879
01:24:11,415 --> 01:24:15,909
<i>Leave him.! He's mine.</i>

880
01:24:15,986 --> 01:24:17,886
Now!

881
01:24:39,176 --> 01:24:41,144
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!
-

882
01:24:50,788 --> 01:24:55,157
Here you are. Here.
I never wanted to be a pirate anyway.

883
01:24:55,225 --> 01:24:59,127
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life doing good works.

884
01:25:04,668 --> 01:25:07,466
I got him!

885
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:12,938
Villain! Ne'er-do-well!

886
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:15,308
<i>Libertine.!</i>

887
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:31,690
- It's Hook! He flies!

888
01:25:34,998 --> 01:25:38,126
And he likes it!

889
01:25:43,941 --> 01:25:46,205
<i>You want to fly? Let's fly.</i>

890
01:25:50,848 --> 01:25:54,443
Not bad... for an old man.

891
01:25:59,356 --> 01:26:01,347
I know what you are!

892
01:26:01,425 --> 01:26:04,053
I am the best there ever was!

893
01:26:04,127 --> 01:26:06,357
You're a tragedy.

894
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:11,959
Me? Tragic?

895
01:26:13,036 --> 01:26:15,971
<i>She was leaving you, Pan.</i>

896
01:26:17,808 --> 01:26:21,676
Your Wendy was leaving you.

897
01:26:21,745 --> 01:26:24,407
<i>Why should she stay?</i>

898
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:29,180
What have you to offer?
You are incomplete.

899
01:26:29,253 --> 01:26:32,552
She'd rather grow up
than stay with you.

900
01:26:38,128 --> 01:26:41,029
Let us now take a peep
into the future.

901
01:26:41,098 --> 01:26:44,932
<i>What's this I see?</i>
<i>'Tis the fair Wendy.</i>

902
01:26:45,002 --> 01:26:49,439
<i>She's in her nursery.</i>
<i>The window's shut.</i>

903
01:26:49,506 --> 01:26:52,998
I'll open it!

904
01:26:53,076 --> 01:26:56,341
I'm afraid the window's barred.
I'll call out her name.

905
01:26:56,413 --> 01:26:58,347
She can't hear you.
No!

906
01:26:58,415 --> 01:27:00,542
She can't see you.
Wendy!

907
01:27:00,617 --> 01:27:04,246
She's forgotten all about you.
Stop! Please! Stop it!

908
01:27:05,923 --> 01:27:08,448
And what is this I see?

909
01:27:08,525 --> 01:27:13,394
There is another in your place.

910
01:27:13,463 --> 01:27:18,127
<i>He is called... husband.</i>

911
01:27:57,841 --> 01:28:01,004
<i>No.! Peter.!</i>

912
01:28:07,217 --> 01:28:09,617
You die alone...

913
01:28:09,686 --> 01:28:13,122
and unloved.

914
01:28:14,324 --> 01:28:16,690
Unloved.

915
01:28:21,365 --> 01:28:23,299
Just like me.

916
01:28:27,738 --> 01:28:30,798
- No!
- No!

917
01:29:01,872 --> 01:29:04,864
<i>- Silence, all,</i>

918
01:29:04,941 --> 01:29:08,274
<i>for Wendy's farewell.</i>

919
01:29:11,181 --> 01:29:13,581
Peter.

920
01:29:16,319 --> 01:29:18,947
I'm sorry. I must grow up.

921
01:29:20,624 --> 01:29:25,561
But... this is yours.

922
01:29:27,564 --> 01:29:30,499
'Tis just a thimble.

923
01:29:32,335 --> 01:29:35,202
How like a girl!

924
01:29:35,272 --> 01:29:39,868
- By all means, my beauty.

925
01:29:39,943 --> 01:29:44,607
Give Peter Pan
your precious thimble.

926
01:30:04,134 --> 01:30:06,796
This belongs to you...

927
01:30:08,238 --> 01:30:10,297
and always will.

928
01:30:32,829 --> 01:30:35,559
Ohh.

929
01:30:40,470 --> 01:30:43,837
That was no thimble.

930
01:30:43,907 --> 01:30:47,274
That was her hidden kiss.

931
01:31:05,829 --> 01:31:07,922
Brace yourselves, lads.

932
01:31:07,998 --> 01:31:10,432
'Tis a powerful thing.

933
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:14,436
Pan, you're pink!

934
01:31:29,586 --> 01:31:31,520
Split my infinitives!

935
01:32:09,559 --> 01:32:12,926
No! I have won!

936
01:32:12,996 --> 01:32:16,591
Whoo-hoo!

937
01:32:16,666 --> 01:32:20,033
<i>You... are old.</i>

938
01:32:20,103 --> 01:32:22,697
But I won!

939
01:32:26,276 --> 01:32:28,767
Old.

940
01:32:30,113 --> 01:32:32,775
And alone!

941
01:32:32,849 --> 01:32:36,910
- Alone.

942
01:32:36,987 --> 01:32:40,946
- No! I won! I won!

943
01:32:41,024 --> 01:32:43,288
-
- Done for.

944
01:32:44,427 --> 01:32:46,088
Happy thoughts.
Happy thoughts.

945
01:32:46,162 --> 01:32:49,791
Ripping! Killing! Killing!
Choking! Lawyers! Dentists!

946
01:32:49,866 --> 01:32:51,766
Old! Alone! Done for!

947
01:32:51,835 --> 01:32:53,803
<i>Old.! Alone.! Done for.!</i>

948
01:32:53,870 --> 01:32:56,270
<i>Old.! Alone.! Done for.!</i>
<i>Pus!</i>

949
01:32:56,339 --> 01:32:58,364
Uh, children's blood.
Puppies' blood.

950
01:32:58,441 --> 01:33:01,467
<i>- Old! Alone! Done for!</i>
<i>Old! Alone! Done for!</i>
<i>- Disease.! Scabs.!</i>

951
01:33:01,544 --> 01:33:04,536
Kittens dashed on spikes! No!

952
01:33:04,614 --> 01:33:08,380
<i>- Old.! Alone.! Done for.!</i>
<i>- White death! Black death!</i>

953
01:33:08,451 --> 01:33:10,942
<i>- Any death.! A nice cup of tea.!</i>
<i>- Old! Alone! Done for!</i>

954
01:33:11,021 --> 01:33:14,252
<i>Old.! Alone.! Done for.!</i>
<i>Old.! Alone.!</i>
<i>Old. Alone.</i>

955
01:33:14,324 --> 01:33:16,292
Done for!

956
01:33:18,862 --> 01:33:21,126
Done for.

957
01:33:27,137 --> 01:33:30,504
Brimstone and gall!
Silence, you dogs!

958
01:33:30,573 --> 01:33:33,474
Or I'll cast anchor in you.

959
01:33:33,543 --> 01:33:37,240
We won! We won!

960
01:33:37,314 --> 01:33:40,477
Ready to cast off?
Aye. Aye, Captain.

961
01:33:51,094 --> 01:33:54,029
Oh, the cleverness of you.

962
01:35:09,139 --> 01:35:11,073
<i>Mother.</i>

963
01:35:16,479 --> 01:35:18,413
Nana.

964
01:35:25,955 --> 01:35:28,048
Let us break it
to her gently.

965
01:35:35,865 --> 01:35:39,266
Oh, Nana.

966
01:35:41,638 --> 01:35:44,198
I dreamt my little ones
had come back.

967
01:35:48,778 --> 01:35:50,905
I dreamed they were asleep...

968
01:35:52,782 --> 01:35:54,943
in their beds.

969
01:35:56,820 --> 01:35:59,186
But they will never come back.

970
01:36:07,197 --> 01:36:11,964
<i>They did not understand</i>
<i>how she could not see them.</i>

971
01:36:12,035 --> 01:36:17,302
<i>But, you see, she saw them in their beds</i>
<i>so often in her dreams...</i>

972
01:36:17,373 --> 01:36:21,002
<i>that she thought this was just</i>
<i>the dream hanging around her still.</i>

973
01:36:30,854 --> 01:36:33,755
<i>Hello, Mother. It really is us.</i>

974
01:36:33,823 --> 01:36:36,519
<i>Michael.</i>

975
01:36:36,593 --> 01:36:38,754
<i>John.</i>
<i>Wendy.</i>

976
01:36:38,828 --> 01:36:41,592
We're back.

977
01:36:41,664 --> 01:36:44,428
George, come quickly!

978
01:36:44,501 --> 01:36:47,163
<i>I'm coming.! What is it?</i>

979
01:36:55,245 --> 01:36:59,682
<i>We're back, Father.</i>
<i>Did you miss us?</i>

980
01:37:03,453 --> 01:37:05,387
You're back.

981
01:37:07,557 --> 01:37:10,287
Good. Excellent.

982
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:13,158
Well done.

983
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:32,846
Oh, my angel.

984
01:37:36,619 --> 01:37:39,144
Of course I missed you.

985
01:37:51,267 --> 01:37:54,259
<i>All right, boys, follow me.</i>
<i>Get your hands off that wallpaper.</i>

986
01:37:54,337 --> 01:37:58,205
Now, come on in.
The silliest thing.
These young gentlemen say that...

987
01:38:04,213 --> 01:38:06,238
You're back.

988
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:17,921
Ohhh.

989
01:38:19,429 --> 01:38:22,921
Mother, Father,
I would like to introduce
the Lost Boys.

990
01:38:22,999 --> 01:38:24,933
Hello.
Hats.

991
01:38:26,436 --> 01:38:28,495
May I keep them?

992
01:38:32,675 --> 01:38:34,609
Well, l-l...

993
01:38:36,713 --> 01:38:40,114
I mean, the expense.

994
01:38:40,183 --> 01:38:43,482
Think of the neighbors.

995
01:38:45,755 --> 01:38:49,122
Dash the neighbors!

996
01:38:49,192 --> 01:38:52,286
And dash the expense!

997
01:38:52,362 --> 01:38:54,796
Welcome to the family, boys.

998
01:38:54,864 --> 01:38:57,560
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

999
01:39:00,703 --> 01:39:04,104
Will this help the expense, Father?

1000
01:39:07,644 --> 01:39:11,774
Anyone for a pony ride?

1001
01:39:13,316 --> 01:39:15,807
I'm Tootles.
Tootles, darling.

1002
01:39:15,885 --> 01:39:18,718
<i>- I'm Curly.</i>
<i>- Curly, darling.</i>

1003
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:23,085
And what's your name?

1004
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:25,389
Nibs. I plan the battles.

1005
01:39:25,461 --> 01:39:27,895
Would you like
a mother, Nibs?

1006
01:39:28,998 --> 01:39:30,932
Yes.
Oh!

1007
01:39:32,568 --> 01:39:36,504
What is the matter, child?
I couldn't find the house.

1008
01:39:36,572 --> 01:39:41,271
And now everyone has
a mother, except me.

1009
01:39:46,783 --> 01:39:49,343
Is your name Slightly?

1010
01:39:49,419 --> 01:39:51,546
Yes.

1011
01:39:51,621 --> 01:39:54,818
Then I am your mother.

1012
01:39:54,891 --> 01:39:56,825
How do you know?

1013
01:39:56,893 --> 01:40:00,488
I feel it in my bones.

1014
01:40:00,563 --> 01:40:03,225
Mother!

1015
01:40:03,299 --> 01:40:05,790
George! Mary! I have a son!

1016
01:40:06,369 --> 01:40:08,803
<i>There could not have been</i>
<i>a lovelier sight,</i>

1017
01:40:08,871 --> 01:40:10,839
<i>but there was none to see it...</i>

1018
01:40:10,907 --> 01:40:14,172
<i>except a strange boy who</i>
<i>was staring in at the window.</i>

1019
01:40:14,243 --> 01:40:17,235
<i>Peter Pan had countless joys...</i>

1020
01:40:17,313 --> 01:40:20,339
<i>that other children</i>
<i>can never know,</i>

1021
01:40:20,416 --> 01:40:23,180
<i>but he was looking</i>
<i>at the onejoy...</i>

1022
01:40:23,252 --> 01:40:26,551
<i>from which he must be</i>
<i>forever barred.</i>

1023
01:40:28,524 --> 01:40:31,982
To live would be
an awfully big adventure.

1024
01:40:51,481 --> 01:40:53,415
Peter!

1025
01:40:55,351 --> 01:40:58,752
You won't forget me, will you?

1026
01:41:00,323 --> 01:41:02,917
Me? Forget?

1027
01:41:21,110 --> 01:41:23,544
Will you come back?

1028
01:41:26,983 --> 01:41:30,316
To hear stories... about me.

1029
01:41:47,203 --> 01:41:52,038
<i>But I was not to see</i>
<i>Peter Pan again.</i>

1030
01:41:52,108 --> 01:41:55,669
<i>Now I tell his story</i>
<i>to my children,</i>

1031
01:41:55,745 --> 01:41:58,578
<i>and they will tell it</i>
<i>to their children...</i>

1032
01:41:58,648 --> 01:42:01,583
<i>and so it will go on.</i>

1033
01:42:01,651 --> 01:42:04,313
<i>For all children grow up...</i>

1034
01:42:06,689 --> 01:42:08,623
<i>except one.</i>

1035
