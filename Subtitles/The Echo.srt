2
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,773
Listen.

3
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:58,013
Listen.

4
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:06,789
Do you hear it?

5
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,739
Go away.

6
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,639
You all have to go away.

7
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:29,413
No!

8
00:01:41,868 --> 00:01:48,364
It's not in my head.

9
00:01:48,475 --> 00:01:50,375
Bobby.

10
00:01:50,477 --> 00:01:53,469
Bobby, where are you?

11
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:58,173
Bobby.

12
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,447
Bobby, why aren't you here?

13
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,819
It's happening again.

14
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,492
They're after me.

15
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,999
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

16
00:02:23,109 --> 00:02:25,634
You hear them, don't you?

17
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,784
No.

18
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:37,879
No!

19
00:03:02,815 --> 00:03:05,807
buzz!

20
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,688
Well, they're hiring non-unions

21
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,457
down at sanitation,
if you're interested.

22
00:03:20,466 --> 00:03:21,797
There's nothing in transportation?

23
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:22,890
Not at the moment.

24
00:03:23,002 --> 00:03:26,529
Do you have any other job skills?

25
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:28,800
Good mechanic.

26
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:32,935
Got a lot of mechanics
waiting for work already.

27
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,379
All right, now what time will I
expect you to call me tonight?

28
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,110
About what?

29
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,846
Well, it says here you
got a board release.

30
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,979
Do you understand what that means?

31
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:46,687
I've never done this before.

32
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,318
It means parole on a short leash.

33
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:50,418
So you call

34
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,225
in the next 24 hours and let me know

35
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:53,959
where you're parking yourself tonight.

36
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:58,268
I'm staying at my mother's.

37
00:03:58,371 --> 00:03:59,360
All right.

38
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:03,738
You come in every Tuesday
for the next six months.

39
00:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,209
Now, this is important,
because you miss one,

40
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,247
you're in violation.

41
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,976
Does your mother know
you're staying with her?

42
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,073
No.

43
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,677
Well, don't you think you
should call and tell her?

44
00:04:15,788 --> 00:04:18,222
She died while I was inside.

45
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:21,616
I'm sorry to hear that.

46
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:24,492
Do you have any other family?

47
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:30,859
Call him in the morning.

48
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,961
He may have work.

49
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,232
Not a lot of employers

50
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,706
want to hire people in your situation.

51
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,570
buzz!

52
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,317
Need something?

53
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:04,627
Helen Reynolds' son.

54
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:05,720
I left you that message.

55
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,821
Oh, yeah, yeah.

56
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:10,027
Of course, 519.

57
00:06:10,136 --> 00:06:13,128
Wait here.

58
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:26,609
I don't know where I'm going.

59
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,186
Elevator to five.

60
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,188
Had to go in to change
the locks, you know?

61
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,282
How come?

62
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,987
Well, the police had
to break the door open,

63
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,121
you know,
when they found her.

64
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,359
I didn't charge you for it, though.

65
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:43,298
Thanks.

66
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:58,777
Going up?

67
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,934
Damn it.

68
00:12:20,706 --> 00:12:21,798
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

69
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:22,896
Where were you?

70
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,476
I was just here inside the house.

71
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:27,068
You were just here inside of the house.

72
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,612
Now, how come I saw
you out by that door?

73
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:31,046
What are you doing at that door?

74
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:36,610
You weren't there?

75
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:39,714
What, am I seeing things?

76
00:12:58,043 --> 00:13:00,068
I really don't understand.

77
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,271
What happened here?

78
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,257
Oh, there's another story again.

79
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:22,459
No, it's not a story.

80
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:24,627
She wanted to play.

81
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,068
She can play inside the apartment.

82
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:29,767
Why do you have to play
with her out in the hallway?

83
00:14:49,321 --> 00:14:52,415
I'll be right with you.

84
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:53,582
What do you guys want?

85
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:54,681
Tell me what's good here.

86
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:57,694
Listen.

87
00:14:57,796 --> 00:14:59,957
Hey.

88
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:06,062
Can you excuse me?

89
00:15:06,171 --> 00:15:07,297
Hi.

90
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:12,008
When did you get back?

91
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:15,041
A couple days.

92
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,705
Are you here for good?

93
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:19,708
I hope so.

94
00:15:24,456 --> 00:15:25,445
I'm sorry about your mom.

95
00:15:25,557 --> 00:15:29,049
I heard what happened.

96
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,120
Yeah, it's...

97
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:34,221
You look great.

98
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:36,164
No, no, I don't.

99
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,701
You don't have to say that.

100
00:15:39,071 --> 00:15:41,096
Maybe a cup of coffee
or something later?

101
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,106
I can't.
I have finals.

102
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,108
School?
You're going to school?

103
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,643
Yep.

104
00:15:46,745 --> 00:15:48,337
That's amazing.

105
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,472
I have to design an
entire line by next week.

106
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:53,415
It's...

107
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,248
everything's really
different for me now.

108
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:56,582
Yeah, maybe another time.

109
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:58,782
Maybe this weekend, maybe-

110
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:01,052
I'm working doubles and school,

111
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,754
and, look,
I have zero free time.

112
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:07,097
I don't think it's a good idea.

113
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,965
Can we get the bill, please?

114
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:12,192
I'm sorry.

115
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,137
I have to get back to work.

116
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,229
It's good to see you.

117
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:17,331
You too.

118
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,169
- Help.
- Mom.

119
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,475
Help me.

120
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,667
See anything wrong?

121
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,500
Got to be a loose brake pad spring.

122
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:55,595
You're sure about that?

123
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:56,765
Guy complained of a rattle

124
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,365
when he drives over bumps, right?

125
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,104
That's right.

126
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:02,407
You know how to check for
misfires in alignment pressure?

127
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,450
Yeah.

128
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:10,478
Look, I've got to be honest with you.

129
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:12,612
Involuntary manslaughter,

130
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,157
that's not exactly
a minor offense, you know?

131
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,659
If I had more to offer you than my word,

132
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:17,751
I would give it to you, man.

133
00:18:17,863 --> 00:18:22,857
But I'm just trying to put
my life back together.

134
00:18:25,003 --> 00:18:25,992
Pay ain't high.

135
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,665
I don't need much.

136
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:33,201
If I hire you, I just ask you
to be straight with me.

137
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:34,370
All right?

138
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,947
It took me a long time
to build this shop,

139
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,413
and I don't want anything risking that.

140
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:38,505
You understand?

141
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:42,553
Give me one week,
and I'll show you what I can do.

142
00:18:42,654 --> 00:18:44,554
Come back tomorrow.

143
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,645
Thank you.

144
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:48,317
All right.

145
00:18:48,427 --> 00:18:49,724
Sir, get up.

146
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,870
buzz!

147
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,309
It's suppertime.

148
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:08,436
He won't answer.

149
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:14,214
Got some plumbing problems,
I think.

150
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,220
Like, I'm hearing noises in the walls.

151
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:34,127
Patrol and unit 25.

152
00:19:45,817 --> 00:19:47,182
We get calls.

153
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:51,950
This is a code four
on First and Broadway.

154
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,046
Code two.

155
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,752
Get 6544.

156
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:35,363
Great.

157
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,373
Miss Trupiano?

158
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,840
Bobby Reynolds.

159
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:45,932
Yeah.

160
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:47,636
Yeah, from high school.

161
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:52,683
Uh, yeah, I was released.

162
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:55,514
Is Louis there?

163
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,521
Oh, yeah?

164
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,389
You got a forwarding number maybe or-

165
00:21:01,493 --> 00:21:04,053
Hello?

166
00:21:04,162 --> 00:21:07,154
Hello?

167
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,566
She's got the dirty mouth
from the South.

168
00:21:12,671 --> 00:21:14,571
All the way from
Pascagoula, Mississippi,

169
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:15,970
it's Molly Ritter.

170
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,272
You handle all the apartments
in the building, man?

171
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:35,641
Who's been in mine?

172
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,476
You have the only key.

173
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,413
Everything okay?

174
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,883
I found these.

175
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,581
They're fingernails.

176
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:49,819
I know what they are, man.

177
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,190
Why-why are they in my place?

178
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,285
Who would keep 'em?

179
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,558
Maybe they belong to your mother?

180
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:55,997
Why would she keep 'em?

181
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,064
When did you speak to her last?

182
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:02,328
Couple of years.

183
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,001
Yeah, you shouldn't have
to hear this from me,

184
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,806
but the neighbors heard from the police.

185
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:10,848
Your mother locked herself
in her apartment for weeks

186
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,407
before she died.

187
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:17,886
What?

188
00:24:17,989 --> 00:24:19,513
You got any idea why she would do that?

189
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,387
No idea.

190
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:22,824
I started work here after.

191
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,395
I never met her.

192
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,987
But when they found her,
she was in real bad shape.

193
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:30,329
You never knew about this?

194
00:24:30,435 --> 00:24:32,494
Nobody check in on her?

195
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:36,404
She didn't have anybody else, man.

196
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:38,169
Maybe one of the neighbors
upstairs knows more.

197
00:24:38,276 --> 00:24:39,265
Well, no offense, son,

198
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,277
but nobody here wants to talk to you.

199
00:24:41,379 --> 00:24:43,677
Everybody knows you were in prison.

200
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,682
People talk.

201
00:24:45,784 --> 00:24:47,877
She was sick,
real sick.

202
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:48,975
Yeah.

203
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:50,816
You-you gonna check on those noises?

204
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:51,946
What noises?

205
00:24:52,057 --> 00:24:53,388
In the walls.

206
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,550
Rusty pipes,
I don't know.

207
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,752
They're coming from somewhere, man.

208
00:24:56,862 --> 00:24:58,727
Well, this is a prewar building.

209
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,990
You know,
walls are thick.

210
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,793
There's vents running
through the ceiling.

211
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,527
There's no sound.

212
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:07,765
You seem to be the only
one hearing things.

213
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:19,516
- I wasn't there.
- You weren't there?

214
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:22,849
What am I- am I seeing things?

215
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,546
I-I don't know what
you're talking about.

216
00:25:24,656 --> 00:25:26,556
Why do you keep lying
to me all the time?

217
00:25:26,658 --> 00:25:27,647
I'm not lying to you.

218
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:28,817
What, I go to work all day.

219
00:25:28,927 --> 00:25:30,121
I come home and what?

220
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,286
No, just just stop.

221
00:25:31,396 --> 00:25:32,385
Who is this guy?

222
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:33,486
Stop.

223
00:25:33,598 --> 00:25:34,622
Stop it.

224
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,132
Please.

225
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,099
Well, you're acting like
I'm- what, like-what am I?

226
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,192
Am I the bad guy here?

227
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:40,362
You're the one that's out-

228
00:25:40,472 --> 00:25:41,598
No, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

229
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,695
I didn't say it.

230
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:44,365
Well, what the hell
were you doing there?

231
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,239
I wasn't doing anything.

232
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:48,005
I don't want to catch
you by that door again.

233
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,105
Are you all right in there?

234
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,598
All right, we'll start you off
with tune-ups.

235
00:26:12,704 --> 00:26:14,035
We'll see how fast you work.

236
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,039
You're also going to bring
the cars in and park them

237
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:17,335
behind the gate every night.

238
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,034
It's freshman work,
but you're the new guy.

239
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:20,202
You show me you got skills,

240
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:21,870
I'll give you more
shifts and bigger jobs.

241
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,413
You hear that?

242
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:26,211
What?

243
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,717
Like a voice.

244
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:29,480
It's a valve grinder.

245
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:33,149
Car keys are in there.

246
00:26:37,729 --> 00:26:39,094
What is that?

247
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:40,562
That's the drop-box.

248
00:26:40,665 --> 00:26:44,362
Don't give keys out till
the customer's paid in full.

249
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,458
You got it?

250
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,300
Had a lot of cars jacked from this shop.

251
00:26:48,406 --> 00:26:50,135
Can't risk that kind
of nonsense anymore.

252
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,441
Yo!

253
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:56,309
You with me?

254
00:26:56,414 --> 00:27:00,441
Yeah.

255
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:02,076
Yeah.

256
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,176
Good.

257
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,051
Get to work.

258
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:20,994
Two sugars, no milk.

259
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,904
I switched to Sweet'N Low.

260
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:29,106
Are you gonna knock it,
or you gonna drink it?

261
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,682
You call anyone from
the neighborhood yet?

262
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:38,255
Yeah, I called around.

263
00:27:38,356 --> 00:27:40,449
Seems like everybody moved away.

264
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:41,957
Hmm.

265
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,493
People grew up.

266
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:47,531
Things ain't what they
used to be, right?

267
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,293
Did you think everything
would be the same?

268
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:53,098
I was hoping some things would be.

269
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:55,895
Bobby-

270
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,201
I know you got questions.

271
00:27:57,308 --> 00:27:58,400
No, no,
I don't have questions.

272
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,499
I had questions,

273
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,909
had questions for the past few years.

274
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:04,413
I stopped asking them
when you stopped writing.

275
00:28:06,985 --> 00:28:10,751
I didn't know if you were
alive or coming back.

276
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:16,950
Why on Earth would you just cut me off?

277
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,121
I thought I was doing it for you.

278
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,561
For me?

279
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,758
Nothing that happened in there

280
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,664
was anything that we
could have talked about.

281
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,670
So what did you think
was going to happen here?

282
00:28:29,774 --> 00:28:31,765
You show up out of thin air,

283
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,709
bring me coffee,
and I forgive you?

284
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,680
You don't think people
deserve a second chance?

285
00:28:42,487 --> 00:28:44,079
Bobby.

286
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:46,657
You want to come by the
apartment some time?

287
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:50,616
Maybe.

288
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,698
I'll take maybe.

289
00:28:53,798 --> 00:28:54,787
Maybe.

290
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,833
I got to go.

291
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:19,847
Can I help you?

292
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,488
No.

293
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:30,057
What are you doing?

294
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,261
Are they coming from you?

295
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:37,307
The sounds,
is that you?

296
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,773
Maybe the woman?

297
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:41,141
What did you say?

298
00:29:42,347 --> 00:29:43,541
There's a woman who lives here.

299
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:44,637
I've seen her at your-

300
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,649
You don't know anything
about who lives here, man.

301
00:29:46,751 --> 00:29:49,015
You hear them.

302
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,647
Don't you?

303
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:54,277
What?
Am I the bad guy here?

304
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,210
No, no, no, no,
I didn't say that.

305
00:31:56,314 --> 00:31:57,303
I didn't say it.

306
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,440
Well, what the hell are you doing there?

307
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:01,108
I wasn't doing anything.

308
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,846
I don't want to catch
you by that door again.

309
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:04,717
Do you understand?

310
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,050
Understand?

311
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,624
Do you understand me?

312
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:08,714
Do you understand?

313
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:10,726
You're hurting me!

314
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,155
There you go!

315
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,254
Don't you ever do that-

316
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:37,368
Oh.

317
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,163
Ew.

318
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:01,679
Listen.

319
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:05,222
Shh, shh.

320
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:08,315
Do you hear it?

321
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:21,061
No, no.

322
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,706
It's not in my head.

323
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,886
Bobby.

324
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:38,455
Bobby, where are you?

325
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:40,217
Bobby.

326
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:43,191
Bobby, why aren't you here?

327
00:37:43,294 --> 00:37:45,228
Oh, it's happening again.

328
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,318
Shh, shh.

329
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,456
They're after me.

330
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,626
I'm not crazy.
I'm not crazy.

331
00:37:51,736 --> 00:37:53,431
You hear them,
don't you?

332
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:58,575
You hear them,
don't you?

333
00:37:58,676 --> 00:37:59,665
Oh, no.

334
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:01,677
No!

335
00:38:56,934 --> 00:38:59,926
Going to the lobby?

336
00:40:19,216 --> 00:40:22,208
Hello?

337
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:41,716
Do you know if he's in there?

338
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:51,823
Hello?

339
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:53,961
Bobby?

340
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:57,234
Your door's open.

341
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:04,037
Hello?

342
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:46,078
You came.

343
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,179
How'd you get in?

344
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,451
Your door was open.

345
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:52,918
You okay?

346
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,520
Yeah.

347
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,929
Who-who lives in that apartment?

348
00:43:56,033 --> 00:43:58,934
Nosy neighbors.

349
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:00,503
I guess they don't feel too comfortable

350
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,902
with an ex-con in the building.

351
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:07,599
Wow.

352
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,179
Yeah, it's hers.

353
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:12,874
All this- all this is hers.

354
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,850
I don't know what to do with it.

355
00:44:15,953 --> 00:44:18,285
Well, it's kind of...

356
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:19,378
Vintage?

357
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,048
Ugly.

358
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,056
Do you like it here?

359
00:44:26,597 --> 00:44:29,828
Getting used to it.

360
00:44:29,933 --> 00:44:32,493
Everybody here seems a little off.

361
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:34,468
Well, it's the East Village.

362
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:40,877
She looks happy.

363
00:44:40,978 --> 00:44:45,381
I don't think she was.

364
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,916
She was on medication.

365
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:50,248
It got so bad that, uh,

366
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:57,556
uh, she stayed here at
the apartment for weeks

367
00:44:57,661 --> 00:45:05,329
and didn't leave until
eventually she starved to death.

368
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,471
I don't know if it was suicide.

369
00:45:09,573 --> 00:45:10,597
Nobody does.

370
00:45:11,575 --> 00:45:13,270
I can't even go in her bedroom.

371
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,437
It sounds crazy,
but I-

372
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:20,313
I feel sometimes like she's still here.

373
00:45:21,518 --> 00:45:25,045
Bobby, it's gonna take time to heal.

374
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:32,221
These are amazing.

375
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:35,492
They're just rough sketches.

376
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,295
What?

377
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,034
Do you ever wonder what
would have happened

378
00:45:47,144 --> 00:45:48,133
if I didn't go away?

379
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:54,706
Sometimes.

380
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:00,983
Do you?

381
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,854
Every day.

382
00:46:08,999 --> 00:46:10,057
What was it like?

383
00:46:14,471 --> 00:46:17,634
Isolating.

384
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:21,370
But at the same time,
you never have any privacy.

385
00:46:23,514 --> 00:46:26,347
You just hang onto the stuff
you had, you know, before, the-

386
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,542
the good things.

387
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:37,082
It's late.

388
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:40,630
I should go.

389
00:46:40,731 --> 00:46:44,599
Yeah.

390
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:01,109
It's good to see you.

391
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,652
You too.

392
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,946
Please, somebody help us!

393
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:41,521
Hang on.

394
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,787
You okay?

395
00:47:55,739 --> 00:47:56,728
Miss?

396
00:47:58,508 --> 00:48:02,035
Miss?

397
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:06,138
You need some help with something?

398
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,524
Whatever it is,

399
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:19,062
I'm right next door
if you need anything.

400
00:48:37,214 --> 00:48:38,203
You need something?

401
00:48:41,652 --> 00:48:45,452
I want you to mind your
own business, okay?

402
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:46,544
Huh?

403
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:12,804
Please open the door.

404
00:49:48,852 --> 00:49:50,285
These measurements aren't right.

405
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:52,510
Are you sure?

406
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,716
Yeah, look at this.

407
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,021
Senior collection's going up Friday,

408
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,322
and you haven't even sewn yet.

409
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,460
I went to see Bobby.

410
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:10,432
I saw a woman standing at his door.

411
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,909
She was crying.

412
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:16,445
I don't know.

413
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:19,845
I-I suppose he doesn't owe me
an explanation or anything.

414
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,350
You still have feelings for him.

415
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:27,687
I don't know.

416
00:50:27,791 --> 00:50:28,780
Maybe.

417
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,894
What if I do?

418
00:50:32,996 --> 00:50:36,727
What am I supposed to do about it?

419
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,700
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

420
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:52,715
Somebody help us!

421
00:50:54,351 --> 00:50:55,340
Come here!

422
00:50:55,452 --> 00:50:56,885
Come here!
Get in here.

423
00:50:58,789 --> 00:50:59,778
Let Carly go.

424
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:01,551
Run, baby, run!

425
00:51:01,658 --> 00:51:05,856
Look at me.

426
00:51:05,962 --> 00:51:07,862
Carly.
Carly!

427
00:51:07,964 --> 00:51:10,296
Do what you have to do to me!

428
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:13,792
Where are you going?

429
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,771
Fuck this.

430
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,397
You weren't there?

431
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,772
What, am I- am I seeing things?

432
00:51:20,877 --> 00:51:23,402
You okay?

433
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:27,176
Why do you keep lying
to me all the time?

434
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:28,273
What, I go to work all day.

435
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:29,374
I come home and-

436
00:51:29,486 --> 00:51:30,748
Here, come in.

437
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:31,843
It's okay.

438
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:35,220
Come on.

439
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,293
- What's your name?
- Am I the bad guy here?

440
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:39,384
You're the one that's out-

441
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,485
No, no, no,
I didn't say that.

442
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,586
I didn't say that.

443
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,029
My name is Bobby.

444
00:51:43,133 --> 00:51:46,068
I know you probably don't want
to talk to strangers, right?

445
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:47,500
But if you tell me

446
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,538
what's going on in there,
I might be able to help you.

447
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:53,370
You want to tell me?

448
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:58,770
You play the piano?

449
00:51:58,882 --> 00:52:00,247
Hey!

450
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,215
Listen to me.

451
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:05,643
Where were you?

452
00:52:05,755 --> 00:52:06,881
Here, inside the house.

453
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,924
You were just here inside of the house?

454
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,515
So how-how come I saw
you out by that door?

455
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:11,821
What were you doing at that door?

456
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,452
Hey, you want to play a real piano?

457
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:14,552
You weren't there?

458
00:52:14,664 --> 00:52:15,653
Come on.

459
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:17,357
Why don't we make some
music on a real piano?

460
00:52:18,668 --> 00:52:20,465
I remember when I couldn't
even reach the pedals,

461
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,697
but I bet you can.

462
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,205
Stay right there.
One second.

463
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,478
smack!

464
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,013
What are you doing?

465
00:52:39,122 --> 00:52:41,386
Don't you dare try to do that again!

466
00:53:07,484 --> 00:53:08,473
This is crazy.

467
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:11,884
Stay right there.

468
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,717
He's never going to hurt
you or your mother again.

469
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:14,812
All right?

470
00:53:14,925 --> 00:53:15,914
Don't you dare do that!

471
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,893
Why do you keep lying
to me all the time?

472
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:30,995
You weren't there?

473
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:34,008
Where were you?

474
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:35,168
No, I didn't say that.

475
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:37,041
Well, what the hell
were you doing there?

476
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:39,537
911.

477
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:40,911
What's your emergency?

478
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:44,612
Yeah, I'm-I'm at 20 Avenue E,
apartment 519.

479
00:53:44,721 --> 00:53:47,212
The guy next door is
beating on his wife.

480
00:53:47,324 --> 00:53:48,552
Do you understand?

481
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:50,023
Can you repeat the location, please?

482
00:53:50,126 --> 00:53:51,184
20 Avenue E.

483
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,556
When I tell you to stay in,
you stay in!

484
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,651
Sir, is anyone hurt?

485
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,025
Yeah, I don't know.

486
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:56,928
Well, just send- you
can't just send somebody?

487
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,501
Sir, I need to confirm
if someone's hurt.

488
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,131
Hey!

489
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,939
I can hear you in there.

490
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:14,945
Hug me once, okay?

491
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:18,043
Open the goddamn door!

492
00:54:26,029 --> 00:54:27,121
Domestic officers arrived.

493
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:28,254
1026?

494
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:31,095
Yeah, right down here.

495
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:32,725
You know the tenants?

496
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,736
No.
They fight a lot.

497
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,772
It got pretty bad tonight.

498
00:54:36,873 --> 00:54:38,568
You see anything?

499
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:40,233
No, but there's a-
there's a little girl,

500
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:43,642
and I didn't want to take chances.

501
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:44,736
The guy is a cop.

502
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:49,913
Please stand back, sir.

503
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:52,543
NYPD.

504
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:57,355
Anybody inside in need of assistance?

505
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,359
Open up!

506
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,898
Roger that.

507
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:15,611
What is this,
a joke?

508
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:17,179
Where are they?

509
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,770
Are you sure this is the apartment?

510
00:55:20,617 --> 00:55:22,642
Yeah.
Yeah.

511
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:24,344
I-I just heard them.

512
00:55:24,454 --> 00:55:27,287
It doesn't look like anyone's
lived here in a very long time.

513
00:55:30,393 --> 00:55:31,382
You been drinking tonight?

514
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:34,327
No.
No!

515
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,126
The daughter was just at my apartment.

516
00:55:36,232 --> 00:55:38,700
What's her name?

517
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:40,167
I-I don't know.

518
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,635
And the wife,
the one that was beaten,

519
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:44,400
do you know her name?

520
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:45,565
She never told me.

521
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,734
Most people know a lot more

522
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,812
about their imaginary
friends than that, pal.

523
00:55:49,913 --> 00:55:52,108
You got yourself one hell
of a vivid imagination.

524
00:55:52,215 --> 00:55:53,614
1080, cancel that call.

525
00:55:53,717 --> 00:55:55,912
10-4.

526
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,214
They were just here!

527
00:55:58,321 --> 00:55:59,583
Look, you know what?

528
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:01,384
Next time,
just don't call us.

529
00:56:01,491 --> 00:56:02,480
Let's go.

530
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:05,584
Wasting my time, man.

531
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,872
Yeah?

532
00:56:22,979 --> 00:56:24,970
Who lives in the apartment next to mine?

533
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:26,981
Why?

534
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:28,516
Because I just called the cops on them,

535
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:31,246
and they showed up,
and there was nobody there.

536
00:56:31,354 --> 00:56:34,949
So what the hell is going on?

537
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:38,519
You called the police on who?

538
00:56:38,628 --> 00:56:40,425
On the guy in the
apartment next to mine.

539
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:41,519
He's a cop.

540
00:56:42,932 --> 00:56:44,661
Look, I don't know what
you're talking about.

541
00:56:44,768 --> 00:56:45,757
That apartment's been empty

542
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:47,166
ever since I started working here.

543
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,602
517, right?

544
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:51,037
Yeah-no.

545
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:53,666
There's-there's a girl.

546
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:56,075
There's a kid and her mom,

547
00:56:56,179 --> 00:56:58,670
and the dad is abusing
them all day long.

548
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:00,079
Everybody in the place can hear it.

549
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,275
Yeah, not everyone.

550
00:57:01,384 --> 00:57:04,911
I've- I've seen them.

551
00:57:05,021 --> 00:57:07,148
Look, I've walked each and
every hall in this building.

552
00:57:07,257 --> 00:57:08,622
I know every tenant that lives here.

553
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:11,819
I've never seen a girl
or a family in 517.

554
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,055
Just you and that guy in 512 live there.

555
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,925
Now, let me sleep.

556
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,592
What?

557
00:58:23,700 --> 00:58:24,724
You're killing me.

558
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,826
Sorry.

559
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:53,553
We still have two more chapters.

560
00:58:53,663 --> 00:58:55,187
I got to go.

561
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,458
What?

562
00:58:56,566 --> 00:58:57,555
Why?

563
00:58:57,667 --> 00:59:00,693
Wait.

564
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:04,100
Are you okay?

565
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:07,903
It was my fault.

566
00:59:08,011 --> 00:59:10,036
What was?

567
00:59:10,146 --> 00:59:12,512
Bobby went to jail because of me.

568
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:16,051
What do you mean?

569
00:59:18,588 --> 00:59:20,647
We were at that bar on Rivington.

570
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:25,790
Some guy followed me into the bathroom.

571
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:28,090
He pushed me up against the wall,

572
00:59:28,197 --> 00:59:30,791
and put his hand over my mouth.

573
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,061
What?

574
00:59:35,104 --> 00:59:40,167
Next thing I know, Bobby,

575
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:46,647
he hit him so hard that I heard
the bones in his face crack.

576
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:50,014
And he didn't stop.

577
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:52,986
The more I cried,
the more Bobby hit him.

578
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:55,080
Al, he killed someone.

579
00:59:57,894 --> 01:00:00,294
I don't know what to do.

580
01:00:00,396 --> 01:00:01,795
I mean,
he did all that time.

581
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:03,490
Maybe he'll hurt you some day.

582
01:00:04,534 --> 01:00:05,728
It's-it's not him.

583
01:00:05,835 --> 01:00:08,929
It never was.

584
01:00:09,038 --> 01:00:12,064
He was only trying to help.

585
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:18,444
I just want you to be careful, okay?

586
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:19,572
Yeah.

587
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,338
What the hell's your problem, man?

588
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,148
You all right, bro?

589
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:43,265
Uh, I got blood coming out of my ears.

590
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,698
How the hell did you do that, man?

591
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:46,791
I don't know.

592
01:01:46,903 --> 01:01:48,393
Go see a doctor.

593
01:01:48,504 --> 01:01:49,732
I got to finish my shift, man.

594
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:50,828
Go see a doctor.

595
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,498
Blood coming out of
your ears ain't normal.

596
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:53,597
Are you sick or something?

597
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:58,272
You doing okay?

598
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,508
How do you mean?

599
01:02:00,616 --> 01:02:02,982
I'm not gonna pretend like I know you,

600
01:02:03,086 --> 01:02:08,080
but you been falling apart
since you took this job.

601
01:02:08,191 --> 01:02:14,460
Um, if I try to explain it,
it's not gonna sound right.

602
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,431
When I came out of recovery,
I started over too.

603
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:19,467
I had a sponsor to talk to
when things got out of hand.

604
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:20,968
You know what I'm saying?

605
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:25,029
You need someone to talk to,
or you're gonna fall apart.

606
01:02:25,141 --> 01:02:26,130
Go home.

607
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:29,336
I'll lock up.

608
01:02:29,445 --> 01:02:34,246
All right.

609
01:02:38,321 --> 01:02:39,345
I'm leaving the city.

610
01:02:39,455 --> 01:02:40,444
I can't stay here.

611
01:02:40,556 --> 01:02:41,545
Why?

612
01:02:41,657 --> 01:02:42,919
I think whatever's-

613
01:02:43,025 --> 01:02:44,856
whatever happened to my
mother is happening to me.

614
01:02:44,961 --> 01:02:47,521
And I-I just- I just
got to make it stop.

615
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:48,722
What?

616
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:51,994
What?

617
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:55,366
I'm hear-I'm hearing sounds,

618
01:02:55,471 --> 01:02:58,907
and I am seeing people who aren't there.

619
01:03:00,977 --> 01:03:04,504
Bobby, your mother was sick.

620
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:07,014
She wasn't crazy.

621
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,607
Something made her crazy.

622
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:12,017
Maybe you leaving

623
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:15,579
did make her depressed.

624
01:03:18,427 --> 01:03:19,917
You deserted her,

625
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:25,626
Iike you deserted a lot
of people in your life.

626
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,869
You got tables.

627
01:03:43,786 --> 01:03:45,549
I got to go.

628
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,747
Open the door.

629
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:34,858
Open the door, please!

630
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:36,431
I know you're in there!

631
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:19,257
What do you want?

632
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,633
What do you want?

633
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,739
- Good morning, sir.
- Yeah.

634
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:28,941
Do you know a Joseph Wright?

635
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,842
He lives down the hall from you.

636
01:07:30,946 --> 01:07:32,004
I just moved in.

637
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:33,672
Heard anything out of the ordinary?

638
01:07:33,783 --> 01:07:35,614
Seen anyone suspicious?

639
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:38,653
No.

640
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:40,779
The neighbors told us you
just got out of Rikers.

641
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,484
Is that true?

642
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:44,581
What's this about?

643
01:07:44,693 --> 01:07:46,354
Were you home all evening?

644
01:07:46,462 --> 01:07:47,759
No, I was with a friend.

645
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:49,728
I may be back with more questions.

646
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,341
No, no.

647
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:10,942
You didn't see anything?

648
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,530
Rick, you want to give
me a hand with this?

649
01:08:30,806 --> 01:08:32,273
Yo, Bobby!

650
01:08:35,744 --> 01:08:37,177
You're an hour late.

651
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,146
Sorry, man, there's something
going on in my building today.

652
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,773
We need to talk.

653
01:08:41,884 --> 01:08:43,511
Yeah.

654
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:46,315
You come by the shop last night?

655
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,049
No.

656
01:08:48,157 --> 01:08:49,146
You sure you didn't come by

657
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,247
the shop last night after closing?

658
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,621
Yeah.

659
01:08:51,727 --> 01:08:53,456
There was a 300 that came
in for a tire balance.

660
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,223
You remember it?

661
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:56,320
It wasn't mine.

662
01:08:56,432 --> 01:08:58,332
I didn't do a balance yesterday.

663
01:08:58,434 --> 01:08:59,799
It's gone.

664
01:08:59,902 --> 01:09:01,392
I came in this morning,
it was off the lot.

665
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:03,438
I called up the owner,
she hasn't picked it up yet.

666
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,972
You got something you
want to ask me, man?

667
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:13,844
Look, my other guys have been
with me for years, Bobby.

668
01:09:13,949 --> 01:09:15,280
All I got on you is your history.

669
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:18,717
But I have a situation
with no other answer.

670
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,288
If that 300 gets returned
in the next hour,

671
01:09:20,389 --> 01:09:21,378
I won't call the cops.

672
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:22,479
I don't have the car, man.

673
01:09:22,591 --> 01:09:24,684
No, I'm trying to give you
the benefit of the doubt here.

674
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,886
Call the cops, man.

675
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:28,190
I don't have the car.

676
01:09:28,297 --> 01:09:31,596
I can't keep you on
until that 300 turns up.

677
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:32,724
Yeah.

678
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,827
All right.

679
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:13,598
Hello?

680
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,637
Hello?

681
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:00,121
Yo, what's this?

682
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:02,053
How the hell did this happen?

683
01:11:02,157 --> 01:11:03,886
Damn, man!

684
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:05,585
Watch the shop.

685
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,169
Are you okay?

686
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:41,955
Alyssa Foldes?
Alyssa Foldes.

687
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:43,456
Anybody-

688
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:48,690
nobody knows her?

689
01:12:48,797 --> 01:12:49,923
Alyssa Foldes?

690
01:12:50,032 --> 01:12:52,091
You know Alyssa?

691
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,601
It's really important
that I talk to her.

692
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:56,227
Sorry.

693
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:57,430
I don't know where she is.

694
01:12:59,074 --> 01:13:00,268
Come on.

695
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:02,469
You got to help me out.

696
01:13:05,381 --> 01:13:06,871
She put a lot of trust in you.

697
01:13:06,982 --> 01:13:09,314
And you're going to end
up hurting her again.

698
01:13:09,418 --> 01:13:11,113
She can't deal with that
in her life right now.

699
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:12,380
You don't know what's going on.

700
01:13:12,488 --> 01:13:13,921
I know Alyssa never showed up tonight.

701
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:15,011
I know she didn't turn in her final.

702
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:16,182
And I know she's only
been acting like this

703
01:13:16,291 --> 01:13:17,280
since you showed up.

704
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:19,827
Just leave her alone.

705
01:13:19,928 --> 01:13:22,055
She knows about the other girl.

706
01:13:22,164 --> 01:13:24,394
What other girl?

707
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,832
The woman at your apartment.

708
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:28,863
Did-did Alyssa talk to her?

709
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:30,871
Don't know.

710
01:13:30,973 --> 01:13:33,032
Just have her call me.

711
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:42,112
Bobby, you there?

712
01:13:42,217 --> 01:13:44,879
It's Hector.

713
01:13:44,987 --> 01:13:46,852
The city towed the wrong car, man.

714
01:13:46,955 --> 01:13:49,185
I'm sorry I doubted you.

715
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:52,488
You still have your job
if you want it, man.

716
01:13:53,695 --> 01:13:56,687
Bobby!

717
01:14:31,733 --> 01:14:32,722
Are you all right, kid?

718
01:14:54,289 --> 01:14:56,257
Hello?

719
01:14:56,358 --> 01:14:58,588
Little girl?

720
01:14:58,694 --> 01:15:02,095
You all right?

721
01:15:03,832 --> 01:15:07,063
Hello?

722
01:15:07,169 --> 01:15:08,602
Where are you?

723
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:17,136
Hello?

724
01:15:17,246 --> 01:15:20,238
Little girl?

725
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:05,052
Help!

726
01:16:05,160 --> 01:16:06,650
Help!

727
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:07,751
Anybody?

728
01:16:07,863 --> 01:16:13,233
Help!

729
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,664
Damn it!

730
01:16:53,775 --> 01:16:54,969
Hello?

731
01:16:55,077 --> 01:16:56,704
Mr. Reynolds, do you know
what day it is today?

732
01:16:56,812 --> 01:16:57,801
No.
What?

733
01:16:57,913 --> 01:16:59,505
It's your weekly check-in.

734
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:03,577
Appointments with your
PO are not optional.

735
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,346
I thought we understood each other.

736
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,443
Yeah.

737
01:17:06,555 --> 01:17:07,647
Sorry.

738
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:10,884
Is there something I should know?

739
01:17:14,429 --> 01:17:15,589
Mr. Reynolds?

740
01:17:15,697 --> 01:17:17,358
I can't talk right now.

741
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,457
Look, let me give this
to you in vivid detail.

742
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:21,661
You speed your way

743
01:17:21,770 --> 01:17:23,067
into the parole office right now,

744
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:25,765
or you illegally violate,
and we come looking for you.

745
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:27,637
You get me?

746
01:17:31,413 --> 01:17:32,402
Mr. Reynolds?

747
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,824
Help-help me!

748
01:18:16,925 --> 01:18:18,825
I know you're in there!
Please!

749
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:21,589
Please open the door!

750
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:09,265
Bobby?

751
01:19:09,377 --> 01:19:11,868
Bobby, can you hear me?

752
01:19:11,980 --> 01:19:13,106
Look, um, those-

753
01:19:13,215 --> 01:19:15,149
those noises that you heard,
I think-

754
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,478
I think I may be hearing them too.

755
01:19:16,585 --> 01:19:18,018
I don't understand what's happening.

756
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,747
You were trying to tell me something,

757
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:21,220
and I didn't listen,
and I'm sorry.

758
01:19:21,323 --> 01:19:23,052
And I'm going to come
and find you, okay?

759
01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:48,404
Open the door!

760
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:00,183
Bobby?

761
01:20:20,582 --> 01:20:23,745
Think I don't know you're in there?

762
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,377
I don't want trouble.

763
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:28,319
You've been watching me.
I see you in the window.

764
01:20:28,423 --> 01:20:29,412
What are you looking at?

765
01:20:31,193 --> 01:20:33,889
Something happened on that floor.

766
01:20:39,801 --> 01:20:41,769
You know something,
don't you?

767
01:20:41,870 --> 01:20:45,271
There was this family living there.

768
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,841
One night,

769
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:49,501
the mother,
she kept screaming.

770
01:20:49,611 --> 01:20:51,602
No.

771
01:20:51,713 --> 01:20:54,876
Don't!

772
01:20:54,983 --> 01:20:57,577
But nobody helped her.

773
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,681
It doesn't make sense.

774
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:02,586
You could-you could have
just called the cops.

775
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:04,886
A lot of terrible things
happen in this city every day.

776
01:21:04,993 --> 01:21:08,190
Either we assumed someone
would call the police,

777
01:21:08,296 --> 01:21:11,231
or we were afraid to,
or worse.

778
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:16,463
Some of us just didn't care.

779
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:19,404
The next morning,
they were all dead.

780
01:21:28,817 --> 01:21:31,809
It's your fault.

781
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,950
You could have done something.

782
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,048
You let them die.

783
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:41,219
Any one of you,
my mother included,

784
01:21:41,329 --> 01:21:42,318
could have saved them.

785
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,796
You realize that?

786
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:54,041
Hey, hey, hey! Wait!

787
01:21:54,142 --> 01:21:56,042
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.

788
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:59,136
Why-why won't they stop?

789
01:22:05,987 --> 01:22:09,218
Hello, Miss?

790
01:22:09,324 --> 01:22:10,313
Is he in there?

791
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:12,086
I really need to find him.

792
01:22:23,638 --> 01:22:27,301
Anyone home?

793
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:37,649
Sorry, I-

794
01:22:37,752 --> 01:22:40,380
the woman who walked
in here, do you...

795
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:55,146
Oh, my God!

796
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:56,245
Alyssa?

797
01:24:56,357 --> 01:24:58,689
Alyssa!

798
01:24:58,793 --> 01:24:59,817
I'm so sorry.

799
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:01,953
I'm so sorry.

800
01:25:02,063 --> 01:25:03,724
Oh, my God.

801
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:04,821
What did they do to you?

802
01:25:10,472 --> 01:25:11,996
Oh, God.

803
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:14,098
Oh, God.

804
01:25:14,209 --> 01:25:15,198
Please.

805
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,210
911.
What is your emergency?

806
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:18,802
I-I need an ambulance.

807
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:20,881
Please.

808
01:25:20,982 --> 01:25:22,677
What is your current location?

809
01:25:26,287 --> 01:25:27,879
Sir?

810
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:28,978
Can you hear me?

811
01:25:30,992 --> 01:25:31,981
Sir?

812
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,328
You're doing real good, honey.

813
01:25:35,430 --> 01:25:37,330
Everything's going to be okay.

814
01:25:37,432 --> 01:25:41,129
But I want you to be strong for mommy.

815
01:25:41,236 --> 01:25:42,999
You got me?

816
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,662
Right.
Let me see that pretty smile.

817
01:25:44,772 --> 01:25:47,764
There.

818
01:25:56,951 --> 01:25:59,044
Hey, what are you doing?

819
01:26:01,389 --> 01:26:05,587
Please don't do this.

820
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:10,596
Don't do what?

821
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:18,738
We're leaving.

822
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:24,868
Why are you leaving?

823
01:26:27,081 --> 01:26:28,070
You know why.

824
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,172
- But you...
- Don't!

825
01:26:29,284 --> 01:26:30,979
You can't leave.
Whoa, whoa.

826
01:26:31,085 --> 01:26:32,074
What?
Don't what?

827
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,176
What?

828
01:26:34,455 --> 01:26:35,683
It's okay.

829
01:26:35,790 --> 01:26:39,191
It's okay.

830
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:40,784
Where are you?

831
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:45,992
Here, here, here, here, here, here.

832
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:48,430
Listen, listen.

833
01:26:50,138 --> 01:26:51,662
You just close your eyes

834
01:26:51,773 --> 01:26:54,537
and go to that special
place like always.

835
01:26:54,642 --> 01:26:56,007
Nothing else will matter.

836
01:26:56,110 --> 01:26:57,099
Carly, are you okay?

837
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:58,270
Why are you crying?
What-

838
01:26:58,379 --> 01:26:59,710
No.

839
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:02,874
I-I really don't understand
what's happening here.

840
01:27:02,984 --> 01:27:03,973
What-what-

841
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:07,482
Why do you want to leave me?

842
01:27:08,690 --> 01:27:09,679
- Why?
- Hmm?

843
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,986
Look at me.

844
01:27:12,093 --> 01:27:14,152
You did- you did this to me.

845
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:16,753
I didn't do that.

846
01:27:16,864 --> 01:27:18,195
Who the hell did that to you?

847
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,334
Go!
Run, baby, run!

848
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:22,425
Look at me!

849
01:27:22,537 --> 01:27:23,765
Just let Carly go, please.

850
01:27:23,871 --> 01:27:26,237
Uh, Carly...

851
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,706
Do what you have to do to me!

852
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:29,037
Carly.

853
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:31,611
I don't understand
what's happening here.

854
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:34,876
Walter.

855
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,777
It's fricking making me-

856
01:27:39,887 --> 01:27:40,876
It makes me so mad!

857
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:44,087
It's making me lose
my freakin' mind, you know.

858
01:27:46,160 --> 01:27:49,789
Why won't you just let us go, please?

859
01:27:49,897 --> 01:27:50,886
Please.

860
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:52,466
Baby.

861
01:27:52,567 --> 01:27:53,829
I love you so much.

862
01:27:56,638 --> 01:27:59,129
Just say it for me once okay?

863
01:27:59,240 --> 01:28:00,468
Just tell me that you love me.

864
01:28:00,575 --> 01:28:02,372
Just once.
Just say it.

865
01:28:02,477 --> 01:28:03,466
Just say that you-

866
01:28:03,578 --> 01:28:04,567
No, no!

867
01:28:04,679 --> 01:28:06,544
Somebody help us!

868
01:28:06,648 --> 01:28:07,740
Please, someone help us!

869
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:09,749
Open this door!
Come on.

870
01:28:09,851 --> 01:28:13,753
Please.

871
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:17,154
No, don't, please.

872
01:28:17,258 --> 01:28:22,787
No, no.

873
01:28:24,265 --> 01:28:25,254
Please, somebody help us!

874
01:28:25,366 --> 01:28:26,492
Come on and help me!

875
01:28:26,601 --> 01:28:28,159
Open the door!

876
01:28:28,269 --> 01:28:29,463
Somebody help us, please!

877
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:30,935
No, Walter, no!

878
01:28:31,039 --> 01:28:32,768
No!

879
01:28:32,874 --> 01:28:34,239
No!

880
01:29:14,716 --> 01:29:16,877
Walter, no!

881
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:19,714
Stop!

882
01:29:21,956 --> 01:29:22,945
You got to stop.

883
01:29:27,829 --> 01:29:30,161
You mind your own business.

884
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:49,479
No!

885
01:31:45,566 --> 01:31:47,534
Alyssa!

886
01:31:50,004 --> 01:31:51,699
Alyssa?

887
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:03,614
Oh, it's okay.

888
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:06,710
It's okay.

889
01:32:07,305 --> 01:33:07,348
