00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,587
I feel like you're driving me
to a court-martial.

3
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,714
This is crazy. What did I do?

4
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,257
I feel like you're going to pull over
and snuff me.

5
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,760
What, you're not allowed to talk?
Hey, Forrest!

6
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,053
We can talk, sir.

7
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:39,932
- Oh, I see. So it's personal?
- No, you intimidate them.

8
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:43,185
Good God, you're a woman.
I honestly... I couldn't have called that.

9
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,729
I mean, I'd apologize,
but isn't that what we're going for here?

10
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:48,607
- I thought of you as a soldier first.
- I'm an airman.

11
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,442
You have, actually,
excellent bone structure, there.

12
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,278
I'm kind of having a hard time
not looking at you now.

13
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,198
Is that weird? Come on, it's okay, laugh.

14
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:59,076
- Sir, I have a question to ask.
- Yes, please.

15
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,830
Is it true you went 12 for 12
with last year's Maxim cover models?

16
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,082
That is an excellent question.
Yes and no.

17
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,625
March and I had a scheduling conflict,

18
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:09,628
but fortunately,
the Christmas cover was twins.

19
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,589
Anything else? You're kidding me
with the hand up, right?

20
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:16,552
- Is it cool if I take a picture with you?
- Yes. It's very cool.

21
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,473
All right.

22
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,642
I don't want to see this
on your MySpace page.

23
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,310
Please, no gang signs.

24
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,979
No, throw it up. I'm kidding.

25
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,065
Yeah, peace. I love peace.
I'd be out of a job with peace.

26
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:34,236
Come on. Hurry up. Just click it.
Don't change any settings. Just click it.

27
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,869
- What's going on?
- Contact left!

28
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,662
What have we got?

29
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,999
Jimmy, stay with Stark!

30
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,125
- Stay down!
- Yeah.

31
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,008
Son of a bitch!

32
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,470
- Wait, wait, wait! Give me a gun!
- Stay here!

33
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,084
Whoa!

34
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,843
Tony Stark.

35
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,764
Visionary. Genius.

36
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,475
American patriot.

37
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,726
Even from an early age,

38
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,271
the son of legendary
weapons developer Howard Stark

39
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,899
quickly stole the spotlight
with his brilliant and unique mind.

40
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:39,444
At age four,
he built his first circuit board.

41
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,697
At age six, his first engine.

42
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:46,201
And at 17, he graduated
summa cum laude from MIT.

43
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:49,538
Then, the passing of a titan.

44
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,042
Howard Stark's lifelong friend
and ally, Obadiah Stane,

45
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,546
steps in to help fill the gap
left by the legendary founder,

46
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:01,091
until, at age 21, the prodigal son returns

47
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,553
and is anointed the new CEO
of Stark Industries.

48
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,971
With the keys to the kingdom,

49
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:08,849
Tony ushers in a new era
for his father's legacy,

50
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,978
creating smarter weapons,
advanced robotics, satellite targeting.

51
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,940
Today, Tony Stark has changed
the face of the weapons industry

52
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,818
by ensuring freedom
and protecting America

53
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,487
and her interests around the globe.

54
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,165
As liaison to Stark Industries,

55
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,502
I've had the unique privilege
of serving with a real patriot.

56
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:41,340
He is my friend
and he is my great mentor.

57
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,009
Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor

58
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:48,430
to present this year's Apogee Award
to Mr. Tony Stark.

59
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:56,938
Tony?

60
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,828
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Thanks for the save.

61
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:15,582
This is beautiful. Thank you.
Thank you all very much.

62
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,125
This is wonderful.

63
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,004
Well, I'm not Tony Stark.

64
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:28,011
But if I were Tony,
I would tell you how honored I feel

65
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:33,100
and what a joy it is
to receive this very prestigious award.

66
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,935
Tony, you know...

67
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,939
The best thing about Tony
is also the worst thing.

68
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,440
He's always working.

69
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,946
Work it! Come on!

70
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,036
- We should just stay till the morning.
- You are unbelievable.

71
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,415
- Oh, no! Did they rope you into this?
- Nobody roped me into anything!

72
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,457
- I'm so sorry.
- But they told me that

73
00:06:57,542 --> 00:07:00,419
if I presented you with an award,
you'd be deeply honored.

74
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,421
Of course I'd be deeply honored.
And it's you, that's great.

75
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,214
- So when do we do it?
- It's right here.

76
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:06,425
- Here you go.
- There it is. That was easy.

77
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,884
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

78
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,262
Wow! Would you look at that?
That's something else.

79
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,930
I don't have any of those
floating around.

80
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:14,141
We're gonna let it ride!

81
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,352
Give me a hand, will you?
Give me a little something-something.

82
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,562
Okay, you, too.

83
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,522
- I don't blow on a man's dice.
- Come on, honey bear.

84
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,108
There it is.
Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes rolls! And...

85
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,443
Two craps. Line away.

86
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,361
- That's what happens.
- Worse things have happened.

87
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:27,863
I think we're gonna be fine.
Color me up, will you?

88
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,448
- This is where I exit.
- All right.

89
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,490
Tomorrow, don't be late.

90
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,825
- Yeah, you can count on it.
- I'm serious!

91
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,201
I know, I know.

92
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,830
Render unto Caesar
that which is Caesar's. There you go.

93
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,503
Mr. Stark! Excuse me, Mr. Stark!

94
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,089
Christine Everhart,
Vanity Fair magazine.

95
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,257
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

96
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,842
- She's cute.
- She's all right?

97
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:49,968
- Hi.
- Hi.

98
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,970
- Yeah. Okay, go.
- It's okay?

99
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,889
You've been called
the da Vinci of our time.

100
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,808
- What do you say to that?
- Absolutely ridiculous. I don't paint.

101
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,477
And what do you say
to your other nickname?

102
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,769
"The Merchant of Death"?

103
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,396
That's not bad.

104
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,275
- Let me guess. Berkeley?
- Brown, actually.

105
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,903
Well, Ms. Brown,

106
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,447
it's an imperfect world,
but it's the only one we've got.

107
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:13,241
I guarantee you, the day weapons are
no longer needed to keep the peace,

108
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,494
I'll start making bricks and beams
for baby hospitals.

109
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,661
Rehearse that much?

110
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,413
Every night in front of the mirror
before bedtime.

111
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,832
- I can see that.
- I'd like to show you first-hand.

112
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,168
All I want is a serious answer.

113
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,504
Okay, here's serious.
My old man had a philosophy,

114
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,006
"Peace means having a bigger stick
than the other guy."

115
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:30,342
That's a great line
coming from the guy selling the sticks.

116
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,220
My father helped defeat the Nazis.
He worked on the Manhattan Project.

117
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,889
A lot of people,
including your professors at Brown,

118
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,182
would call that being a hero.

119
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,434
And a lot of people
would also call that war profiteering.

120
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,686
Tell me, do you plan to report
on the millions we've saved

121
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,522
by advancing medical technology

122
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,941
or kept from starvation
with our intelli-crops?

123
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,277
All those breakthroughs,
military funding, honey.

124
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,781
You ever lose an hour of sleep
your whole life?

125
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,783
I'd be prepared to lose a few with you.

126
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,632
Good morning. It's 7:00 a.m.

127
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:14,386
The weather in Malibu
is 72 degrees with scattered clouds.

128
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:17,889
The surf conditions are fair
with waist-to-shoulder high lines.

129
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,433
High tide will be at 10:52 a.m.

130
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:38,743
Tony?

131
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:41,496
Hey, Tony?

132
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,562
You are not authorized
to access this area.

133
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,398
- Jesus.
- That's Jarvis. He runs the house.

134
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:11,526
I've got your clothes here.
They've been dry-cleaned and pressed,

135
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:13,361
and there's a car waiting for you outside

136
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,739
that will take you anywhere
you'd like to go.

137
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,576
- You must be the famous Pepper Potts.
- Indeed I am.

138
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:25,081
After all these years, Tony still has you
picking up the dry-cleaning.

139
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,501
I do anything and everything
that Mr. Stark requires,

140
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:31,379
including, occasionally,
taking out the trash.

141
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,547
Will that be all?

142
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,107
Give me an exploded view.

143
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,444
The compression in cylinder three
appears to be low.

144
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,071
Log that.

145
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,910
- I'm gonna try again, right now.
- Please don't turn down my music.

146
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,994
I'll keep you posted.

147
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,829
You are supposed to be
halfway around the world right now.

148
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,290
- How'd she take it?
- Like a champ.

149
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,917
Why are you trying to hustle me
out of here?

150
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,710
Your flight was scheduled to leave
an hour and a half ago.

151
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,921
That's funny, I thought with it being
my plane and all,

152
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,547
that it would just wait for me
to get there.

153
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,383
Tony, I need to speak to you
about a couple things

154
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,550
before I get you out of the door.

155
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,886
Doesn't it kind of defeat the whole
purpose of having your own plane

156
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:21,179
if it departs before you arrive?

157
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:24,641
Larry called. He's got another buyer
for the Jackson Pollock in the wings.

158
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,351
Do you want it? Yes or no.

159
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:28,520
Is it a good representation
of his spring period?

160
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,815
No. The Springs was actually
the neighborhood in East Hampton

161
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,149
where he lived and worked,

162
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,734
- not "spring" like the season.
- So?

163
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:39,197
I think it's a fair example.
I think it's incredibly overpriced.

164
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,659
I need it. Buy it. Store it.

165
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,995
Okay.
The MIT commencement speech...

166
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,873
Is in June. Please, don't harangue me
about stuff that's way, way, down...

167
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,376
They're haranguing me,
so I'm gonna say yes.

168
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,961
Deflect it and absorb it.
Don't transmit it back to me.

169
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,379
I need you to sign this
before you get on the plane.

170
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:56,381
What are you trying to get rid of me for?
What, you got plans?

171
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,008
- As a matter of fact, I do.
- I don't like it when you have plans.

172
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,136
I'm allowed to have plans
on my birthday.

173
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,721
- It's your birthday?
- Yes.

174
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,264
I knew that. Already?

175
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,934
Yeah. Isn't that strange?
It's the same day as last year.

176
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,396
- Get yourself something nice from me.
- I already did.

177
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,940
- And?
- It was very nice.

178
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,485
- Yeah.
- Very tasteful. Thank you, Mr. Stark.

179
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,280
You're welcome, Miss Potts.

180
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,451
Okay.

181
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:46,431
You're good.
I thought I lost you back there.

182
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:51,019
You did, sir.
I had to cut across Mulholland.

183
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,645
I got you. I got you.

184
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,147
What's wrong with you?

185
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,774
- What?
- Three hours.

186
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,984
I got caught doing a piece
for Vanity Fair.

187
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,069
For three hours. For three hours
you got me standing here.

188
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,697
Waiting on you now. Let's go. Come on.

189
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,325
Wheels up! Rock and roll!

190
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,960
- What you reading, platypus?
- Nothing.

191
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,254
Come on, sour patch. Don't be mad.

192
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,049
I told you, I'm not mad.
I'm indifferent, okay?

193
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,592
- I said I was sorry.
- Good morning, Mr. Stark.

194
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,802
You don't need to apologize to me.
I'm your man.

195
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,928
Hi. I told him I was sorry, but he...

196
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,387
- I'm just indifferent right now.
- Hot towel?

197
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,680
You don't respect yourself,

198
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,140
- so I know you don't respect me.
- I respect you.

199
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,558
I'm just your babysitter.

200
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,144
So, when you need
your diaper changed... Thank you.

201
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,438
Let me know
and I'll get you a bottle, okay?

202
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,148
Hey! Heat up the sake, will you?

203
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,650
- Thanks for reminding me.
- No, I'm not talking...

204
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,485
We're not drinking.
We're working right now.

205
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,987
- You can't have sashimi without sake.
- You are constitutionally

206
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,656
incapable of being responsible.

207
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,283
It would be irresponsible not to drink.
I'm just talking about a nightcap.

208
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,409
Hot sake?

209
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,830
- Yes, two, please.
- No. I'm not drinking. I don't want any.

210
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,248
That's what I'm talking about.

211
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,376
When I get up in the morning
and I'm putting on my uniform,

212
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,253
you know what I recognize?

213
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:03,550
I see in that mirror that every person
that's got this uniform on got my back!

214
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,344
Hey, you know what?
I'm not like you. I'm not cut out...

215
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,514
No, no. You don't have to be like me!
But you're more than what you are.

216
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,432
Can you excuse me if
I'm a bit distracted here?

217
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,602
No! You can't be distracted right now!
Listen to me!

218
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,245
General.

219
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:35,915
Welcome, Mr. Stark. We look forward
to your weapons presentation.

220
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Thanks.

221
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:41,796
Is it better to be feared or respected?

222
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,049
I say, is it too much to ask for both?

223
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,887
With that in mind,
I humbly present the crown jewel

224
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,763
of Stark Industries' Freedom Line.

225
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:51,890
It's the first missile system

226
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,851
to incorporate our proprietary
repulsor technology.

227
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:58,897
They say the best weapon
is one you never have to fire.

228
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,940
I respectfully disagree.

229
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:05,069
I prefer the weapon
you only have to fire once.

230
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,531
That's how Dad did it.
That's how America does it.

231
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,451
And it's worked out pretty well so far.

232
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,869
Find an excuse

233
00:15:12,953 --> 00:15:16,247
to let one of these off the chain,
and I personally guarantee you

234
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:19,876
the bad guys won't even want
to come out of their caves.

235
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,148
For your consideration, the Jericho.

236
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:54,744
I'll be throwing one of these in

237
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,829
with every purchase
of 500 million or more.

238
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:57,956
To peace!

239
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,751
- Tony.
- Obie, what are you doing up?

240
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,295
I couldn't sleep till I found out
how it went. How'd it go?

241
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,214
It went great. Looks like it's gonna be
an early Christmas.

242
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,176
Hey! Way to go, my boy!
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

243
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,719
Why aren't you wearing those pajamas
I got you?

244
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,388
Good night, Tony.

245
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,266
- Hey, Tony.
- I'm sorry, this is the "fun-vee."

246
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:19,310
The "hum-drum-vee" is back there.

247
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:22,105
- Nice job.
- See you back at base.

248
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,257
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

249
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,629
What the hell did you do to me?

250
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,006
What I did?

251
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,051
What I did is to save your life.

252
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:18,930
I removed all the shrapnel I could,
but there's a lot left,

253
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:20,848
and it's headed into your atrial septum.

254
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,351
Here, want to see?

255
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,854
I have a souvenir. Take a look.

256
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,734
I've seen many wounds like that
in my village.

257
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,237
We call them the walking dead

258
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,490
because it takes about a week
for the barbs to reach the vital organs.

259
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:40,368
- What is this?
- That is an electromagnet,

260
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:43,287
hooked up to a car battery,

261
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:46,290
and it's keeping the shrapnel
from entering your heart.

262
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,634
That's right. Smile.

263
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:02,473
We met once, you know,
at a technical conference in Bern.

264
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,560
- I don't remember.
- No, you wouldn't.

265
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,980
If I had been that drunk,
I wouldn't have been able to stand,

266
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,233
much less give a lecture
on integrated circuits.

267
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,651
Where are we?

268
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,488
Come on, stand up. Stand up!

269
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,491
Just do as I do.

270
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,244
Come on, put your hands up.

271
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,455
Those are my guns.
How did they get my guns?

272
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,916
Do you understand me? Do as I do.

273
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,608
He says, "Welcome, Tony Stark,
the most famous mass murderer

274
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,526
"in the history of America."

275
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:00,489
He is honored.

276
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,785
He wants you to build the missile.

277
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,497
The Jericho missile
that you demonstrated.

278
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,252
This one.

279
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,300
I refuse.

280
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,103
Tony!

281
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,447
He wants to know what you think.

282
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,200
I think you got a lot of my weapons.

283
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:39,297
He says they have everything you need
to build the Jericho missile.

284
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:42,049
He wants you to make
the list of materials.

285
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,888
He says for you
to start working immediately,

286
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:51,225
and when you're done,
he will set you free.

287
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,273
- No, he won't.
- No, he won't.

288
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:13,456
I'm sure they're looking for you, Stark.

289
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,625
But they will never find you
in these mountains.

290
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:22,006
Look, what you just saw,

291
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,925
that is your legacy, Stark.

292
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,889
Your life's work,
in the hands of those murderers.

293
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,266
Is that how you want to go out?

294
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:37,772
Is this the last act of defiance
of the great Tony Stark?

295
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,066
Or are you going to
do something about it?

296
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,279
Why should I do anything?
They're going to kill me, you, either way.

297
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,616
And if they don't,
I'll probably be dead in a week.

298
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,076
Well, then,

299
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,788
this is a very important week for you,
isn't it?

300
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,086
If this is going to be my work station,
I want it well-lit. I want these up.

301
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:03,381
I need welding gear.
I don't care if it's acetylene or propane.

302
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:05,633
I need a soldering station. I need
helmets. I'm gonna need goggles.

303
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,761
I would like a smelting cup.
I need two sets of precision tools.

304
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,568
- How many languages do you speak?
- A lot.

305
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,363
But apparently,
not enough for this place.

306
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,490
They speak Arabic, Urdu,

307
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:32,993
Dari, Pashto, Mongolian,
Farsi, Russian.

308
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:38,457
- Who are these people?
- They are your loyal customers, sir.

309
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,168
They call themselves the Ten Rings.

310
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,012
You know, we might be more productive

311
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,890
if you include me
in the planning process.

312
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,693
Okay, we don't need this.

313
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,113
What is that?

314
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,950
That's palladium, 0.15 grams.

315
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:17,037
We need at least 1.6, so why don't
you go break down the other 11?

316
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,625
What's he doing?

317
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,544
Working.

318
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,557
Careful.
Careful, we only get one shot at this.

319
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:39,351
Relax. I have steady hands.

320
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,855
Why do you think you're still alive?

321
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:52,490
- What do I call you?
- My name is Yinsen.

322
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,409
Yinsen. Nice to meet you.

323
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,120
Nice to meet you, too.

324
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,454
That doesn't look like a Jericho missile.

325
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,999
That's because
it's a miniaturized arc reactor.

326
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,127
I got a big one
powering my factory at home.

327
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,214
It should keep the shrapnel
out of my heart.

328
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,966
But what could it generate?

329
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:56,637
If my math is right, and it always is,
three gigajoules per second.

330
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,557
That could run your heart
for 50 lifetimes.

331
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,726
Yeah. Or something big for 15 minutes.

332
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,072
- This is our ticket out of here.
- What is it?

333
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,158
Flatten them out and look.

334
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:21,704
Oh, wow.

335
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,375
Impressive.

336
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,361
Good.

337
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,114
Good roll. Good roll.

338
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,783
You still haven't told me
where you're from.

339
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,703
I'm from a small town called Gulmira.

340
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,206
- It's actually a nice place.
- Got a family?

341
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:10,919
Yes, and I will see them
when I leave here.

342
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,339
And you, Stark?

343
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,637
- No.
- No?

344
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,016
So you're a man who has everything

345
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,060
and nothing.

346
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,775
It doesn't look anything like the picture.

347
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,443
Maybe it's been modified.

348
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,569
The tail is wrong.

349
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,654
It's just backwards.

350
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,659
Relax.

351
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,962
The bow and arrow

352
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,923
once was the pinnacle
of weapons technology.

353
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,887
It allowed the great Genghis Khan

354
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,682
to rule from the Pacific to the Ukraine.

355
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,020
An empire twice the size
of Alexander the Great

356
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,691
and four times
the size of the Roman Empire.

357
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,654
But today,

358
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:46,867
whoever holds the latest Stark weapons

359
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,787
rules these lands.

360
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,499
And soon,

361
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,212
it will be my turn.

362
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,893
Why have you failed me?

363
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:15,395
We're working.

364
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,064
Diligently.

365
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:19,066
I let you live.

366
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,278
This is how you repay me?

367
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:26,281
It's very complex.

368
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,034
He's trying very hard.

369
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,410
On his knees.

370
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,750
You think I'm a fool?

371
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,794
I'll get the truth.

372
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,879
We're both working.

373
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,471
Open your mouth.

374
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,848
What does he want?

375
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,225
You think I'm a fool?

376
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,605
What's going on?

377
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,608
Tell me the truth.

378
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,277
He's building your Jericho.

379
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,782
What do you want? A delivery date?

380
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,416
I need him.

381
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,086
Good assistant.

382
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:29,887
You have till tomorrow
to assemble my missile.

383
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,037
Okay? Can you move?

384
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,373
Okay, say it again.

385
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,959
41 steps straight ahead. Then 16 steps,

386
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,545
that's from the door,
fork right, 33 steps, turn right.

387
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,471
Where is Stark?

388
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,723
He was here a moment ago.

389
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,933
Go look for him.

390
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:16,243
Yinsen! Yinsen! Stark!

391
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,370
Say something.
Say something back to him.

392
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,831
- He's speaking Hungarian. I don't...
- Then speak Hungarian.

393
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,417
- Okay. I know.
- What do you know?

394
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,817
- How'd that work?
- Oh, my goodness.

395
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,861
- It worked all right.
- That's what I do.

396
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:53,572
- Let me finish this.
- Initialize the power sequence.

397
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:54,948
Okay.

398
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:57,200
- Now!
- Tell me. Tell me.

399
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,912
Function 11.
Tell me when you see a progress bar.

400
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,539
- It should be up right now.
- Yes.

401
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,749
Talk to me. Tell me when you see it.

402
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:05,375
- I have it.
- Press Control "l".

403
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,878
- "I." Got it.
- "I." "Enter." "l" and "Enter."

404
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,713
Come over here and button me up.

405
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:13,925
Okay. All right.

406
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,343
Every other hex bolt.

407
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,554
- They're coming!
- Nothing pretty, just get it done.

408
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,014
- Just get it done.
- They're coming.

409
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,727
Make sure the checkpoints are clear
before you follow me out, okay?

410
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,562
We need more time.

411
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:27,773
Hey,

412
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,860
- I'm gonna go buy you some time.
- Stick to the plan!

413
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,987
Stick to the plan!

414
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,157
Yinsen!

415
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,290
- Yinsen!
- Watch out!

416
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,515
Stark.

417
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,935
Come on. We got to go.

418
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:55,563
Move for me, come on. We got a plan.
We're gonna stick to it.

419
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,565
This was always the plan, Stark.

420
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,193
Come on, you're gonna go
see your family. Get up.

421
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,613
My family is dead.

422
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,700
I'm going to see them now, Stark.

423
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:10,578
It's okay.

424
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,667
I want this. I want this.

425
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,591
Thank you for saving me.

426
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:29,055
Don't waste it. Don't waste your life.

427
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,095
My turn.

428
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,700
Not bad.

429
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,025
Hey!

430
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,508
How was the "fun-vee"?

431
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,221
Next time, you ride with me, okay?

432
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:29,045
Watch it, coming up here.

433
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,133
Are you kidding me with this?
Get rid of them.

434
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,770
Your eyes are red.
A few tears for your long-lost boss?

435
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:50,483
- Tears of joy. I hate job hunting.
- Yeah, vacation's over.

436
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,319
Where to, sir?

437
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,029
- Take us to the hospital, please, Happy.
- No.

438
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,197
No? Tony, you have to

439
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,282
- go to the hospital.
- No is a complete answer.

440
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,117
- The doctor has to look at you.
- I don't have to do anything.

441
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:00,868
I've been in captivity for three months.

442
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:04,706
There are two things I want to do.
I want an American cheeseburger,

443
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:05,748
- and the other...
- That's enough of that.

444
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,251
...is not what you think. I want you
to call for a press conference now.

445
00:43:08,335 --> 00:43:09,586
- Call for a press conference?
- Yeah.

446
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,213
- What on earth for?
- Hogan, drive. Cheeseburger first.

447
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:26,436
Look at this!

448
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,522
Tony.

449
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,694
- We were going to meet at the hospital.
- No, I'm fine.

450
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,195
Look at you!

451
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,324
- You had to have a burger, yeah?
- Well, come on.

452
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:41,868
- You get me one of those?
- There's only one left. I need it.

453
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,665
Hey, look who's here! Yeah!

454
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:54,505
- Miss Potts?
- Yes.

455
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,840
Can I speak to you for a moment?

456
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:59,552
I'm not part of the press conference,
but it's about to begin right now.

457
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:00,970
I'm not a reporter.

458
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,472
I'm Agent Phil Coulson,

459
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,307
with the Strategic Homeland
Intervention, Enforcement

460
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,975
and Logistics Division.

461
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,811
- That's quite a mouthful.
- I know. We're working on it.

462
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:13,316
You know, we've been approached
already by the DOD, the FBI, the CIA...

463
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,070
We're a separate division
with a more specific focus.

464
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:20,823
We need to debrief Mr. Stark
about the circumstances of his escape.

465
00:44:20,908 --> 00:44:24,202
- I'll put something in the book, shall I?
- Thank you.

466
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,584
Hey, would it be all right
if everyone sat down?

467
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,088
Why don't you just sit down?
That way you can see me, and I can...

468
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,382
A little less formal and...

469
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,931
- What's up with the love-in?
- Don't look at me.

470
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,058
I don't know what he's up to.

471
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,560
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

472
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,105
I never got to say goodbye to Dad.

473
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:55,066
I never got to say goodbye to my father.

474
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,154
There's questions
that I would have asked him.

475
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,282
I would have asked him how he felt
about what this company did.

476
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,662
If he was conflicted,
if he ever had doubts.

477
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:12,875
Or maybe he was every inch the man
we all remember from the newsreels.

478
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,340
I saw young Americans killed

479
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:24,262
by the very weapons I created
to defend them and protect them.

480
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,056
And I saw

481
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:33,062
that I had become part of a system that
is comfortable with zero accountability.

482
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,148
- Mr. Stark!
- Hey, Ben.

483
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,859
What happened over there?

484
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,405
I had my eyes opened.
I came to realize that I have more

485
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,868
to offer this world
than just making things that blow up.

486
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:50,413
And that is why, effective immediately,
I am shutting down

487
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,167
the weapons manufacturing division
of Stark International

488
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,254
until such a time as I can decide
what the future of the company will be.

489
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,922
I think we're gonna be selling
a lot of newspapers.

490
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,758
What direction it should take,
one that I'm comfortable with

491
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:05,887
and is consistent with the highest good
for this country, as well.

492
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:12,018
What we should take away from this
is that Tony's back!

493
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,812
And he's healthier than ever.

494
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,274
We're going to have
a little internal discussion

495
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,777
and we'll get back to you
with the follow-up.

496
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,239
- Where is he?
- He's inside.

497
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,961
Well, that... That went well.

498
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,464
Did I just paint a target
on the back of my head?

499
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,883
Your head? What about my head?

500
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,011
What do you think the over-under on
the stock drop is gonna be tomorrow?

501
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,181
- Optimistically, 40 points.
- At minimum.

502
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,557
Yep.

503
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:55,144
Tony, we're a weapons manufacturer.

504
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,897
Obie, I just don't want a body count
to be our only legacy.

505
00:46:57,981 --> 00:47:00,608
That's what we do. We're iron mongers.
We make weapons.

506
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:01,818
It's my name on the side of the building.

507
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,529
And what we do
keeps the world from falling into chaos.

508
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,572
Not based on what I saw.

509
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:08,825
We're not doing a good enough job.

510
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,159
We can do better.
We're gonna do something else.

511
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:13,120
Like what?
You want us to make baby bottles?

512
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:17,375
I think we should take another look
into arc reactor technology.

513
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:21,796
Come on.
The arc reactor, that's a publicity stunt!

514
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:25,258
Tony, come on. We built that thing
to shut the hippies up!

515
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,469
- It works.
- Yeah, as a science project.

516
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:32,223
The arc was never cost effective.
We knew that before we built it.

517
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,476
Arc reactor technology,
that's a dead end, right?

518
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:36,727
Maybe.

519
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,730
Am I right? We haven't had
a breakthrough in that in what?

520
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:42,358
- Thirty years.
- That's what they say.

521
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,196
Could you have a lousier poker face?
Just tell me, who told you?

522
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,533
- Never mind who told me. Show me.
- It's Rhodey or Pepper.

523
00:47:50,617 --> 00:47:52,952
- I want to see it.
- Okay, Rhodey.

524
00:48:01,336 --> 00:48:02,837
- Okay.
- Okay?

525
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,383
It works.

526
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,600
Listen to me, Tony. We're a team.
Do you understand?

527
00:48:15,684 --> 00:48:18,936
There's nothing we can't do
if we stick together,

528
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,438
like your father and I.

529
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,315
I'm sorry I didn't give you
a heads-up, okay?

530
00:48:22,399 --> 00:48:23,983
- But if I had...
- Tony.

531
00:48:24,067 --> 00:48:27,069
Tony, no more of this
"ready, fire, aim" business.

532
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:29,906
- You understand me?
- That was Dad's line.

533
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,658
You gotta let me handle this.

534
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:35,161
We're gonna have to play
a whole different kind of ball now.

535
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:37,079
We're going to have
to take a lot of heat.

536
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,416
I want you to promise me
that you're gonna lay low.

537
00:48:40,667 --> 00:48:42,418
Stark Industries!

538
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:45,379
I've got one recommendation!
Ready? Ready?

539
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,631
Sell, sell, sell!

540
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,799
Abandon ship!

541
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:52,261
Does the Hindenburg ring any bells?

542
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:58,559
Let me show you the new
Stark Industries business plan!

543
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:04,148
Look, that's a weapons company
that doesn't make weapons!

544
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:07,526
Pepper. How big are your hands?

545
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,237
- What?
- How big are your hands?

546
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:13,199
- I don't understand why...
- Get down here. I need you.

547
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,666
Hey.

548
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,212
Let's see them. Show me your hands.

549
00:49:26,296 --> 00:49:27,296
Let's see them.

550
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,715
Oh, wow. They are small.
Very petite, indeed.

551
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:33,219
I just need your help for a sec.

552
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,180
Oh, my God, is that the thing
that's keeping you alive?

553
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,849
It was. It is now an antique.

554
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,436
This is what will be keeping me alive
for the foreseeable future.

555
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:47,149
I'm swapping it up for an upgraded unit,
and I just ran into a little speed bump.

556
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:50,152
- Speed bump, what does that mean?
- It's nothing. It's just a little snag.

557
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,614
There's an exposed wire
under this device.

558
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,826
And it's contacting the socket wall
and causing a little bit of a short.

559
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,577
It's fine.

560
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,372
- What do you want me to do?
- Put that on the table over there.

561
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:03,249
- That is irrelevant.
- Oh, my God!

562
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,628
I want you to reach in, and you're just
gonna gently lift the wire out.

563
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,506
- Is it safe?
- Yeah, it should be fine.

564
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,216
It's like Operation.
You just don't let it touch

565
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:13,676
the socket wall or it goes "beep."

566
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,220
- What do you mean, "Operation"?
- It's just a game, never mind.

567
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:20,349
- Just gently lift the wire. Okay? Great.
- Okay.

568
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,687
You know, I don't think
that I'm qualified to do this.

569
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:28,816
No, you're fine.
You're the most capable, qualified,

570
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:32,445
trustworthy person I've ever met.
You're gonna do great.

571
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,656
Is it too much of a problem to ask?
'Cause I'm...

572
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:38,409
- Okay, okay.
- I really need your help here.

573
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,618
Okay.

574
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,541
Oh, there's pus!

575
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:50,254
It's not pus. It's an inorganic
plasmic discharge from the device,

576
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:52,256
- not from my body.
- It smells!

577
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:53,883
Yeah, it does.

578
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,927
The copper wire.
The copper wire, you got it?

579
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,137
- Okay, I got it! I got it!
- Okay, you got it?

580
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,140
Now, don't let it touch the sides
when you're coming out!

581
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,224
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

582
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,642
That's what
I was trying to tell you before.

583
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,895
Okay, now make sure
that when you pull it out, you don't...

584
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:08,898
There's a magnet at the end of it!
That was it. You just pulled it out.

585
00:51:08,982 --> 00:51:10,149
- Oh, God!
- Okay, I was not expecting...

586
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,401
- Don't put it back in! Don't put it back in!
- Okay, what do I do?

587
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:13,486
What's wrong?

588
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,945
Nothing,
I'm just going into cardiac arrest

589
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,322
'cause you yanked it out like a trout...

590
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:19,158
- What? You said it was safe!
- We gotta hurry. Take this. Take this.

591
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,243
- You gotta switch it out really quick.
- Okay. Okay.

592
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:23,370
- Tony? It's going to be okay.
- What?

593
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:24,413
- Is it?
- It's gonna be okay.

594
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,166
- I'm gonna make this okay.
- Let's hope.

595
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,837
Okay, you're gonna attach that
to the base plate. Make sure you...

596
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,428
Was that so hard? That was fun, right?
Here, I got it. I got it. Here.

597
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,639
Nice.

598
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,974
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I feel great.

599
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,351
You okay?

600
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,647
Don't ever, ever, ever,

601
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:52,733
ever ask me to do
anything like that ever again.

602
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,944
I don't have anyone but you.

603
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:01,575
Anyway...

604
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,376
- What do you want me to do with this?
- That?

605
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:12,545
Destroy it.

606
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:14,588
Incinerate it.

607
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,882
You don't want to keep it?

608
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:21,137
Pepper, I've been called many things.
"Nostalgic" is not one of them.

609
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:25,391
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- That will be all, Miss Potts.

610
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,810
Hey, Butterfingers, come here.

611
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,812
What's all this stuff
doing on top of my desk?

612
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,107
That's my phone,
that's a picture of me and my dad.

613
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:36,110
Right there. In the garbage.
All that stuff.

614
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:46,579
The future of air combat.
Is it manned or unmanned?

615
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,998
I'll tell you, in my experience,

616
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:53,836
no unmanned aerial vehicle
will ever trump a pilot's instinct,

617
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,462
his insight,

618
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,549
that ability to look
into a situation beyond the obvious

619
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:02,261
and discern its outcome,
or a pilot's judgment.

620
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:05,347
Colonel?
Why not a pilot without the plane?

621
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:07,433
Look who fell out of the sky.
Mr. Tony Stark.

622
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:09,435
- Hello, sir.
- Speaking of manned or unmanned,

623
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:11,353
you gotta get him to tell you
about the time he guessed wrong

624
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:14,064
at spring break.
Just remember that, spring break, 1987.

625
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,441
- That lovely lady you woke up with.
- Don't do that!

626
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,901
- What was his name?
- Don't do that.

627
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:18,068
- Was it Ivan?
- Don't do that.

628
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:19,403
They'll believe it. Don't do that.

629
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,654
- Okay.
- Don't do that.

630
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,699
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Give us a couple minutes, you guys.

631
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,287
- I'm surprised.
- Why?

632
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:31,123
I swear, I didn't expect to see you
walking around so soon.

633
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,042
I'm doing a little better than walking.

634
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:34,627
- Really?
- Yeah.

635
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,963
Rhodey, I'm working on something big.

636
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:41,050
I came to talk to you.
I want you to be a part of it.

637
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,762
You're about to make a whole
lot of people around here real happy,

638
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:47,848
'cause that little stunt
at the press conference,

639
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,516
that was a doozy.

640
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:54,396
This is not for the military. I'm not...
It's different.

641
00:53:54,481 --> 00:53:57,149
What? You're a humanitarian now
or something?

642
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,651
- I need you to listen to me.
- No.

643
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:02,655
What you need is time
to get your mind right.

644
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,075
- I'm serious.
- Okay.

645
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,205
It's nice seeing you, Tony.

646
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:12,498
Thanks.

647
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:24,134
- Jarvis, you up?
- For you, sir, always.

648
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:28,305
I'd like to open a new project file,
index as Mark II.

649
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:33,185
Shall I store this on
the Stark Industries Central Database?

650
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,854
Actually, I don't know
who to trust right now.

651
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:38,774
Till further notice, why don't we just
keep everything on my private server?

652
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,568
Working on a secret project,
are we, sir?

653
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,617
I don't want this winding up
in the wrong hands.

654
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,247
Maybe in mine,
it can actually do some good.

655
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:39,251
Next. Up.

656
00:55:39,878 --> 00:55:42,755
Not in the boot, Dummy. Right here.
You got me?

657
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,923
Stay put. Nice.

658
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,596
You're of no benefit at all.
Move down to the toe. I got this.

659
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,223
Okay, I'm sorry, am I in your way?

660
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:01,273
Up.

661
00:56:02,108 --> 00:56:03,942
Screw it. Don't even move.

662
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:07,112
You are a tragedy.

663
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,541
Okay, let's do this right.

664
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,045
Start mark, half a meter,
and back and center.

665
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,008
Dummy, look alive.
You're on standby for fire safety.

666
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,510
You, roll it.

667
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:35,391
Okay. Activate hand controls.

668
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:40,896
We're gonna start off nice and easy.

669
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:44,149
We're gonna see if
10% thrust capacity achieves lift.

670
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,609
And three,

671
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,486
two,

672
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,405
one.

673
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:28,777
Up two. All right, set that.

674
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,280
I've been buzzing you.
Did you hear the intercom?

675
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,198
Yeah, everything's... What?

676
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,450
- Obadiah's upstairs.
- Great!

677
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,535
- What would you like me to tell him?
- Great. I'll be right up.

678
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,245
Okay.

679
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:40,831
I thought you said
you were done making weapons.

680
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:41,915
It is.

681
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:46,003
This is a flight stabilizer.
It's completely harmless.

682
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:51,258
I didn't expect that.

683
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:57,973
How'd it go?

684
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,894
It went that bad, huh?

685
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:04,646
Just because I brought pizza
back from New York

686
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:08,609
- doesn't mean it went bad.
- Sure doesn't. Oh, boy.

687
00:58:08,693 --> 00:58:11,570
It would have gone better
if you were there.

688
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,363
You told me to lay low.
That's what I've been doing.

689
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:17,993
- I lay low, and you take care of all...
- Hey, come on. In public. The press.

690
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:23,248
- This was a board of directors meeting.
- This was a board of directors meeting?

691
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,752
The board is claiming
you have posttraumatic stress.

692
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:27,961
They're filing an injunction.

693
00:58:28,046 --> 00:58:30,088
- A what?
- They want to lock you out.

694
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:31,381
Why, 'cause the stocks
dipped 40 points?

695
00:58:31,466 --> 00:58:32,466
We knew that was gonna happen.

696
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,635
- Fifty-six and a half.
- It doesn't matter.

697
00:58:34,719 --> 00:58:36,929
We own the controlling interest
in the company.

698
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,765
Tony, the board has rights, too.

699
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:44,520
They're making the case
that you and your new direction

700
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,855
- isn't in the company's best interest.
- I'm being responsible!

701
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,942
That's a new direction for me,
for the company.

702
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,738
I mean, me on the company's behalf
being responsible for the way that...

703
00:58:54,822 --> 00:58:55,864
This is great.

704
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,409
- Oh, come on. Tony. Tony.
- I'll be in the shop.

705
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,703
Hey, hey! Hey, Tony. Listen.

706
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:05,123
I'm trying to turn this thing around,
but you gotta give me something.

707
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,792
Something to pitch them.

708
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:10,379
Let me have the engineers analyze that.
You know, draw up some specs.

709
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,589
- No. No, absolutely not.
- It'll give me a bone to throw the boys

710
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,258
- in New York!
- This one stays with me.

711
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:17,177
- That's it, Obie. Forget it.
- All right, well, this stays with me, then.

712
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:19,096
Go on, here, you can have a piece.

713
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:20,681
- Take two.
- Thank you.

714
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:22,641
You mind if I come down there
and see what you're doing?

715
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,351
Good night, Obie.

716
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:29,815
Day 11, test 37, configuration 2.0.
For lack of a better option,

717
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:32,568
Dummy is still on fire safety.
If you douse me again,

718
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:35,487
and I'm not on fire,
I'm donating you to a city college.

719
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,406
All right, nice and easy.

720
00:59:37,490 --> 00:59:42,452
Seriously, just gonna start off
with 1% thrust capacity.

721
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,039
And three, two, one.

722
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:58,885
Okay.

723
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,805
Please don't follow me around
with it, either,

724
01:00:01,889 --> 01:00:04,308
'cause I feel like I'm gonna
catch on fire spontaneously.

725
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,101
Just stand down!
If something happens, then come in.

726
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:08,437
And again, let's bring it up to 2.5.

727
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,147
Three, two, one.

728
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,291
Okay, this is where I don't want to be!

729
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,709
Not the car, not the car!

730
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,045
Table!

731
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:48,268
Could be worse! Could be worse!
We're fine! Okay.

732
01:01:06,371 --> 01:01:07,913
No!

733
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,625
Yeah, I can fly.

734
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,341
- Jarvis, are you there?
- At your service, sir.

735
01:01:19,425 --> 01:01:21,677
- Engage Heads Up Display.
- Check.

736
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,804
Import all preferences
from home interface.

737
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,347
Will do, sir.

738
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:33,313
All right, what do you say?

739
01:01:33,398 --> 01:01:36,900
I have indeed been uploaded, sir.
We're online and ready.

740
01:01:36,984 --> 01:01:38,610
Can we start the virtual walk-around?

741
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,697
Importing preferences
and calibrating virtual environment.

742
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:43,073
Do a check on control surfaces.

743
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,700
As you wish.

744
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,141
Test complete. Preparing to
power down and begin diagnostics.

745
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:12,144
Yeah. Tell you what.
Do a weather and ATC check.

746
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,729
Start listening in on ground control.

747
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,896
Sir, there are still terabytes

748
01:02:14,981 --> 01:02:17,566
of calculations needed
before an actual flight is...

749
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,570
Jarvis! Sometimes you got to run
before you can walk.

750
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,991
Ready? In three, two, one.

751
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,057
Handles like a dream.

752
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:20,754
All right, let's see what
this thing can do.

753
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:22,255
What's SR-71 's record?

754
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,134
The altitude record for fixed wing flight
is 85,000 feet, sir.

755
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:29,221
Records are made to be broken!
Come on!

756
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:36,019
Sir, there is a potentially fatal
buildup of ice occurring.

757
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,229
Keep going!

758
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,816
Higher!

759
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:58,750
We iced up, Jarvis!
Deploy flaps! Jarvis!

760
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,880
Come on, we got to break the ice!

761
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,375
Kill power.

762
01:06:04,585 --> 01:06:07,963
Notes. Main transducer feels sluggish
at plus 40 altitude.

763
01:06:08,047 --> 01:06:12,467
Hull pressurization is problematic.
I'm thinking icing is the probable factor.

764
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:14,803
A very astute observation, sir.

765
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,638
Perhaps, if you intend
to visit other planets,

766
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:18,181
we should improve the exosystems.

767
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:20,850
Connect to the sys. Co.
Have it reconfigure the shell metals.

768
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:24,020
Use the gold titanium alloy from
the seraphim tactical satellite.

769
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:27,983
That should ensure a fuselage integrity
while maintaining power-to-weight ratio.

770
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:29,317
- Got it?
- Yes.

771
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:31,736
Shall I render
using proposed specifications?

772
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,196
Thrill me.

773
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:39,119
Tonight's red-hot red carpet is right
here at the Disney Concert Hall,

774
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:43,456
where Tony Stark's third annual benefit
for the Firefighter's Family Fund

775
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,125
has become the place to be
for L.A.'s high society.

776
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:46,459
Jarvis, we get an invite for that?

777
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,045
I have no record of an invitation, sir.

778
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:50,588
...hasn't been seen in public

779
01:06:50,673 --> 01:06:54,426
since his bizarre and highly
controversial press conference.

780
01:06:54,593 --> 01:06:57,262
Some claim he's suffering
from posttraumatic stress

781
01:06:57,346 --> 01:07:00,974
and has been bedridden for weeks.
Whatever the case may be,

782
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:04,185
no one expects an appearance
from him tonight.

783
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,438
The render is complete.

784
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:08,189
A little ostentatious, don't you think?

785
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:11,359
What was I thinking?
You're usually so discreet.

786
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,613
Tell you what.
Throw a little hot-rod red in there.

787
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:18,616
Yes, that should help you
keep a low profile.

788
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:23,663
The render is complete.

789
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,041
Hey, I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it.

790
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,709
Commencing automated assembly.

791
01:07:27,793 --> 01:07:30,962
Estimated completion time is five hours.

792
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,172
Don't wait up for me, honey.

793
01:07:56,363 --> 01:08:00,116
Weapons manufacturing is only
one small part of what Stark Industries

794
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:03,995
is all about, and our partnership
with the fire and rescue community...

795
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:09,167
- Hey, Tony, remember me?
- Sure don't.

796
01:08:10,669 --> 01:08:12,170
You look great, Hef.

797
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:15,298
We're going to have a great quarter.

798
01:08:15,382 --> 01:08:19,135
What's the world coming to when
a guy's got to crash his own party?

799
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:23,431
Look at you. Hey, what a surprise.

800
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,266
I'll see you inside.

801
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,104
Hey. Listen, take it slow, all right?

802
01:08:29,188 --> 01:08:30,939
I think I got the board
right where we want them.

803
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:34,609
You got it. Just cabin fever.
I'll just be a minute.

804
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:42,700
- Give me a Scotch. I'm starving.
- Mr. Stark?

805
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:45,161
- Yeah?
- Agent Coulson.

806
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,831
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The guy from the...

807
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:51,251
Strategic Homeland Intervention,
Enforcement and Logistics Division.

808
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,961
God, you need a new name for that.

809
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:55,046
Yeah, I hear that a lot.

810
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:59,634
Listen, I know this must be a trying time
for you, but we need to debrief you.

811
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,678
There's still
a lot of unanswered questions,

812
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:03,638
and time can be a factor
with these things.

813
01:09:03,722 --> 01:09:05,765
Let's just put something on the books.

814
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:09,227
How about the 24th at 7:00 p.m.
At Stark Industries?

815
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,856
Tell you what.
You got it. You're absolutely right.

816
01:09:13,065 --> 01:09:17,277
Well, I'm going to go to my assistant,
and we'll make a date.

817
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:20,822
You look fantastic!
I didn't recognize you.

818
01:09:20,906 --> 01:09:23,158
- What are you doing here?
- Just avoiding government agents.

819
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:25,034
- Are you by yourself?
- Yes. Where'd you get that dress?

820
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,953
- Oh, it was a birthday present.
- That's great.

821
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,164
- From you, actually.
- Well, I got great taste.

822
01:09:29,248 --> 01:09:30,498
Yes.

823
01:09:30,583 --> 01:09:32,500
- You want to dance?
- Oh, no.

824
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,086
- All right, come on.
- Thank you. No.

825
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,765
Am I making you uncomfortable?

826
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:53,396
No. No. I always forget to wear
deodorant and dance with my boss

827
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,317
in front of everyone that I work with
in a dress with no back.

828
01:09:57,610 --> 01:10:00,153
- You look great and you smell great.
- Oh, God.

829
01:10:00,237 --> 01:10:02,113
But I could fire you if that would
take the edge off.

830
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,867
I actually don't think that
you could tie your shoes without me.

831
01:10:05,951 --> 01:10:07,368
- I'd make it a week. Sure.
- Really?

832
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:09,954
What's your Social Security number?

833
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,210
- Five.
- Five?

834
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,337
- Right.
- Right.

835
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:19,756
You're missing just
a couple of digits there.

836
01:10:19,840 --> 01:10:23,051
The other eight?
So I got you for the other eight.

837
01:10:35,648 --> 01:10:38,691
- How about a little air?
- Yes, I need some air.

838
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:42,570
- That was totally weird.
- Totally harmless.

839
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,490
It was totally not harmless, by the way.

840
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:46,950
We're dancing. No one's even watching.

841
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,826
Everybody who I work with...
No, you know why?

842
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:52,080
I think you lost objectivity. I think
they just... People... We just danced.

843
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:55,541
No, it was not just a dance. You don't
understand because you're you.

844
01:10:55,626 --> 01:10:58,419
And everybody knows
exactly who you are

845
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,756
and how you are with girls
and all of that, which is completely fine.

846
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,217
But, you know, then me, you're my boss,

847
01:11:04,301 --> 01:11:06,261
- and I'm dancing with you.
- I don't think it was taken that way.

848
01:11:06,345 --> 01:11:09,222
Because it makes me look like
the one who's trying to...

849
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,224
- I just think you're overstating it.
- You know, and we're here,

850
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:15,103
and then I'm wearing this ridiculous

851
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:17,939
dress, and then we were dancing
like that and...

852
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:34,789
- I would like a drink, please.
- Got it, okay.

853
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,085
- I would like a vodka martini, please.
- Okay.

854
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:43,881
Very dry with olives, a lot of olives.
Like, at least three olives.

855
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:47,802
Two vodka martinis, extra dry,
extra olives, extra fast.

856
01:11:47,886 --> 01:11:50,054
Make one of them dirty, will you?

857
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:57,270
Wow. Tony Stark.

858
01:11:57,604 --> 01:11:59,939
- Oh, hey.
- Fancy seeing you here.

859
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:04,986
- Carrie.
- Christine.

860
01:12:05,070 --> 01:12:06,070
That's right.

861
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,823
You have a lot of nerve
showing up here tonight.

862
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:10,325
Can I at least get a reaction from you?

863
01:12:10,409 --> 01:12:12,827
Panic. I would say panic is my reaction.

864
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:14,287
'Cause I was referring
to your company's

865
01:12:14,371 --> 01:12:15,705
involvement in this latest atrocity.

866
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:18,333
Yeah. They just put my name on the
invitation. I don't know what to tell you.

867
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,793
I actually almost bought it,
hook, line and sinker.

868
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,254
I was out of town for a couple months,
in case you didn't hear.

869
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,673
Is this what you call accountability?

870
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:28,468
It's a town called Gulmira. Heard of it?

871
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,440
- When were these taken?
- Yesterday.

872
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:44,942
- I didn't approve any shipment.
- Well, your company did.

873
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,986
Well, I'm not my company.

874
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:51,366
- Please, do you mind?
- Have you seen these pictures?

875
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,784
- What's going on in Gulmira?
- Tony, Tony.

876
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:56,204
- You can't afford to be this naive.
- You know what? I was naive before,

877
01:12:56,288 --> 01:12:58,122
when they said,
"Here's the line. We don't cross it.

878
01:12:58,207 --> 01:12:59,582
"This is how we do business."

879
01:12:59,666 --> 01:13:02,877
If we're double-dealing under the table...
Are we?

880
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:05,463
Tony, your picture, please!

881
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:11,177
Let's take a picture. Come on.
Picture time!

882
01:13:12,971 --> 01:13:16,099
Tony. Who do you think locked you out?

883
01:13:16,809 --> 01:13:20,103
I was the one who filed
the injunction against you.

884
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,274
It was the only way I could protect you.

885
01:13:27,653 --> 01:13:28,861
No. No.

886
01:13:36,912 --> 01:13:41,207
The 15-mile hike to the outskirts
of Gulmira can only be described

887
01:13:41,291 --> 01:13:45,002
as a descent into hell,
into a modern day Heart of Darkness.

888
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:48,089
Simple farmers and herders
from peaceful villages

889
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:49,882
have been driven from their homes,

890
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:54,220
displaced from their lands by warlords
emboldened by a new-found power.

891
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:57,557
Villagers have been forced to take
shelter in whatever crude dwellings

892
01:13:57,641 --> 01:14:00,435
they can find in the ruins
of other villages,

893
01:14:00,519 --> 01:14:04,355
or here in the remnants
of an old Soviet smelting plant.

894
01:14:09,153 --> 01:14:12,530
Recent violence has been attributed
to a group of foreign fighters

895
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:15,366
referred to by locals as the Ten Rings.

896
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,953
As you can see, these men are
heavily armed and on a mission.

897
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:23,166
A mission that could prove fatal
to anyone who stands in their way.

898
01:14:23,375 --> 01:14:25,918
With no political will
or international pressure,

899
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:28,463
there's very little hope
for these refugees.

900
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,799
Around me, a woman begging for news
on her husband,

901
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:33,676
who was kidnapped by insurgents,

902
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:36,345
either forced to join their militia...

903
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,974
Desperate refugees clutch
yellowed photographs,

904
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,643
holding them up to anyone
who will stop.

905
01:14:42,728 --> 01:14:46,355
A child's simple question,
"Where are my mother and father?"

906
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:50,359
There's very little hope
for these refugees,

907
01:14:50,444 --> 01:14:54,322
refugees who can only wonder who,
if anyone, will help.

908
01:16:27,291 --> 01:16:28,457
Hurry it up.

909
01:16:28,542 --> 01:16:29,750
Put the women in the trucks.

910
01:16:29,835 --> 01:16:30,876
Stack the weapons here.

911
01:16:30,961 --> 01:16:31,961
Clear all the houses.

912
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:33,713
That one there.
Faster. Faster.

913
01:16:41,888 --> 01:16:42,888
Grab that dog.

914
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,977
Put him with the others.

915
01:16:58,822 --> 01:17:00,197
What the hell is this?

916
01:17:11,835 --> 01:17:13,711
Shoot this dog.

917
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:15,463
You're all incompetent.

918
01:17:18,759 --> 01:17:19,800
Turn your head.

919
01:18:26,576 --> 01:18:28,285
He's all yours.

920
01:19:27,095 --> 01:19:29,096
What the hell was that?
Were we cleared to go in there?

921
01:19:29,181 --> 01:19:31,265
No, they were using human shields.
We never got the green light.

922
01:19:31,349 --> 01:19:33,058
Put me through to State.
They're going to be all over this.

923
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,810
Get those monitors up!

924
01:19:34,895 --> 01:19:36,228
We got a bogey!

925
01:19:36,313 --> 01:19:38,439
- Wasn't Air Force!
- We got the CIA on the line?

926
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:40,483
I've got Langley on the line.
They want to know if it's us.

927
01:19:40,567 --> 01:19:42,234
No, it definitely is not us, sir!

928
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,986
- It wasn't Navy.
- Wasn't Marines.

929
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,572
I need answers!
Can I please get eyes on target?

930
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,908
- Negative, negative.
- Cannot identify.

931
01:19:49,034 --> 01:19:51,660
Get me Colonel Rhodes from
Weapons Development down here now!

932
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:00,211
We ran an ID check
and cross-referenced

933
01:20:00,295 --> 01:20:02,004
with all known databases.
We have nothing.

934
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:04,298
Any high altitude surveillance
in the region?

935
01:20:04,382 --> 01:20:06,091
We got an AWAC
and a Global Hawk in the area.

936
01:20:06,176 --> 01:20:07,843
So this thing just appeared
out of nowhere?

937
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:09,303
How come it didn't show up
on the radar?

938
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,347
Got a minimal radar cross-section, sir.

939
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,599
- Is it stealth?
- No, sir, it's tiny.

940
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:16,060
We think it's an unmanned
aerial vehicle.

941
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,978
Colonel, what are we dealing with here?

942
01:20:20,524 --> 01:20:23,484
- Let me make a call.
- Sergeant, clear a hole.

943
01:20:27,030 --> 01:20:28,823
- Hello?
- Tony?

944
01:20:28,907 --> 01:20:30,658
- Who's this?
- It's Rhodes.

945
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,993
- Sorry, hello?
- I said it's Rhodes.

946
01:20:33,078 --> 01:20:35,955
- Speak up, please.
- What in the hell is that noise?

947
01:20:36,039 --> 01:20:39,500
- Oh, yeah, I'm driving with the top down.
- Yeah, well, I need your help right now.

948
01:20:39,584 --> 01:20:40,960
It's funny how that works, huh?

949
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:44,421
Yeah. Speaking of funny, we've got a
weapons depot that was just blown up

950
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:46,173
a few clicks from where
you were being held captive.

951
01:20:46,258 --> 01:20:47,883
Well, that's a hot spot.

952
01:20:47,968 --> 01:20:50,469
Sounds like someone stepped in
and did your job for you, huh?

953
01:20:50,554 --> 01:20:51,637
Why do you sound out of breath, Tony?

954
01:20:51,721 --> 01:20:52,930
I'm not, I was just jogging in the canyon.

955
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,807
- I thought you were driving.
- Right, I was driving

956
01:20:54,891 --> 01:20:56,684
to the canyon, where I'm going to jog.

957
01:20:56,768 --> 01:20:59,103
You sure you don't have any tech
in that area I should know about?

958
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,688
- Nope!
- Bogey spotted!

959
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,524
- Whiplash, come in hot.
- Okay, good, 'cause I'm staring at one

960
01:21:03,608 --> 01:21:06,986
right now, and it's about to be blown
to kingdom come.

961
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,446
That's my exit.

962
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,621
Ballroom, this is Whiplash One.
I've got the bogey in my sights.

963
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:19,248
Whiplash One, what is it?

964
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:20,666
I've got no idea.

965
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,085
- You have radio contact?
- Non responsive, sir.

966
01:21:23,169 --> 01:21:24,253
Then you are clear to engage.

967
01:21:26,298 --> 01:21:27,298
Hit it.

968
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:35,139
That bogey just went supersonic.
I got a lock!

969
01:21:39,144 --> 01:21:41,145
- Inbound missile.
- Flares!

970
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,775
Wait a second. Bogey deployed flares!

971
01:22:01,041 --> 01:22:02,291
Deploy flaps!

972
01:22:03,501 --> 01:22:04,710
Holy!

973
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,378
That thing just jumped off the radar, sir.

974
01:22:06,463 --> 01:22:08,005
The sat visual has been lost.

975
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:09,757
No way that's a UAV.

976
01:22:09,841 --> 01:22:11,008
What is it?

977
01:22:11,092 --> 01:22:12,635
I can't see anything.

978
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,179
Whatever it was, it just bought the farm.

979
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:18,307
I think bogey's been handled, sir.

980
01:22:27,692 --> 01:22:29,360
- Hello?
- Hi, Rhodey, it's me.

981
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,111
- It's who?
- I'm sorry, it is me.

982
01:22:31,196 --> 01:22:32,488
You asked.
What you were asking about is me.

983
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:34,073
No, see, this isn't a game.

984
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:37,451
You do not send civilian equipment
into my active war zone.

985
01:22:37,535 --> 01:22:39,453
- You understand that?
- This is not a piece of equipment.

986
01:22:39,537 --> 01:22:42,373
I'm in it. It's a suit. It's me!

987
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,875
Rhodey, you got anything for me?

988
01:22:46,044 --> 01:22:49,421
- Mark your position and return to base.
- Roger that, Ballroom.

989
01:22:51,633 --> 01:22:52,800
On your belly!

990
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:54,760
It looks like a man!

991
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,638
Shake him off! Roll! Roll!

992
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:06,814
I'm hit! I'm hit!

993
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:09,233
It's confirmed. He has been hit.

994
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,364
Punch out! Punch out!

995
01:23:21,746 --> 01:23:23,497
Whiplash One down.

996
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,165
Whiplash Two, do you see a chute?

997
01:23:25,250 --> 01:23:27,501
Negative! No chute, no chute!

998
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,425
My chute's jammed!

999
01:23:40,432 --> 01:23:42,766
Sir, I've got a visual on the bogey.

1000
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:45,477
Whiplash Two, reengage.
If you get a clear shot, you take it.

1001
01:23:48,023 --> 01:23:49,857
Major, we don't even know
what we're shooting at.

1002
01:23:49,941 --> 01:23:52,026
- Call off the Raptors.
- That thing just took out an F-22

1003
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,444
inside a legal no fly zone!

1004
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,863
Whiplash Two,
if you have a clear shot, take it!

1005
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:58,323
You've been reengaged.
Execute evasive maneuver.

1006
01:23:58,408 --> 01:23:59,783
Keep going!

1007
01:24:07,375 --> 01:24:09,418
Good chute! Good chute!

1008
01:24:17,010 --> 01:24:19,887
- Tony, you still there?
- Hey, thanks.

1009
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:22,556
Oh, my God, you crazy son of a bitch.

1010
01:24:23,349 --> 01:24:24,808
You owe me a plane.
You know that, right?

1011
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:29,021
Yeah, well, technically, he hit me.

1012
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:30,689
Now are you going to come by
and see what I'm working on?

1013
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:33,650
No, no, no, no, no, no,
the less I know, the better.

1014
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,360
Now, what am I supposed
to tell the press?

1015
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:37,946
Training exercise.
Isn't that the usual BS?

1016
01:24:38,031 --> 01:24:39,782
It's not that simple.

1017
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:42,409
An unfortunate training exercise

1018
01:24:42,494 --> 01:24:45,370
involving an F-22 Raptor
occurred yesterday.

1019
01:24:46,122 --> 01:24:49,500
I am pleased to report
that the pilot was not injured.

1020
01:24:49,584 --> 01:24:53,504
As for the unexpected turn of events
on the ground in Gulmira,

1021
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:57,091
it is still unclear
who or what intervened,

1022
01:24:57,175 --> 01:25:01,345
but I can assure you that the United
States government was not involved.

1023
01:25:03,348 --> 01:25:04,473
Hey!

1024
01:25:06,351 --> 01:25:08,227
It is a tight fit, sir.

1025
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:12,106
Sir, the more you struggle,
the more this is going to hurt.

1026
01:25:12,190 --> 01:25:14,149
Be gentle. This is my first time.

1027
01:25:15,026 --> 01:25:17,861
I designed this to come off, so... Hey.

1028
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,866
- I really should be able to...
- Please, try not to move, sir.

1029
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:26,703
What's going on here?

1030
01:25:31,251 --> 01:25:35,337
Let's face it. This is not the worst
thing you've caught me doing.

1031
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:37,756
Are those bullet holes?

1032
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:06,451
Welcome.

1033
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:11,915
Compliments of Tony Stark.

1034
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:16,503
If you'd killed him when you were
supposed to, you'd still have a face.

1035
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:18,672
You paid us trinkets to kill a prince.

1036
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,549
Show me the weapon.

1037
01:26:21,759 --> 01:26:25,262
Come. Leave your guards outside.

1038
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:44,573
His escape bore unexpected fruit.

1039
01:26:47,243 --> 01:26:49,203
So this is how he did it.

1040
01:26:49,537 --> 01:26:52,039
This is only a first, crude effort.

1041
01:26:52,248 --> 01:26:54,541
Stark has perfected his design.

1042
01:26:54,959 --> 01:26:57,461
He has made a masterpiece of death.

1043
01:26:58,129 --> 01:27:01,298
A man with a dozen of these
can rule all of Asia.

1044
01:27:02,926 --> 01:27:05,260
And you dream of Stark's throne.

1045
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:09,306
We have a common enemy.

1046
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:15,562
If we are still in business,

1047
01:27:18,107 --> 01:27:20,317
I will give you these designs

1048
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:22,819
as a gift.

1049
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:25,864
And in turn,

1050
01:27:27,533 --> 01:27:32,663
I hope you'll repay me with
a gift of iron soldiers.

1051
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:46,593
This is the only gift you shall receive.

1052
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:50,973
Technology.

1053
01:27:52,850 --> 01:27:56,353
It's always been your Achilles' heel
in this part of the world.

1054
01:27:57,563 --> 01:28:00,732
Don't worry. It'll only last for 15 minutes.

1055
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:04,361
That's the least of your problems.

1056
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:12,244
Crate up the armor and the rest of it.

1057
01:28:13,871 --> 01:28:15,914
All right, let's finish up here.

1058
01:28:19,877 --> 01:28:22,796
Set up Sector 16
underneath the arc reactor,

1059
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:26,425
and I'm going to want this data masked.
Recruit our top engineers.

1060
01:28:26,509 --> 01:28:28,385
I want a prototype right away.

1061
01:28:36,561 --> 01:28:39,730
Hey. You busy?
You mind if I send you on an errand?

1062
01:28:39,814 --> 01:28:42,065
I need you to go to my office.

1063
01:28:42,567 --> 01:28:44,985
You're going to hack into the mainframe
and you're going to retrieve all

1064
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,654
the recent shipping manifests.
This is a lock chip.

1065
01:28:47,739 --> 01:28:49,323
This'll get you in.

1066
01:28:49,407 --> 01:28:50,991
It's probably under Executive Files.

1067
01:28:51,075 --> 01:28:53,493
If not, they put it on a ghost drive,
in which case you need

1068
01:28:53,578 --> 01:28:56,246
to look for the lowest numeric heading.

1069
01:28:56,539 --> 01:28:58,999
And what do you plan to do with
this information if I bring it back here?

1070
01:28:59,083 --> 01:29:00,167
Same drill.

1071
01:29:00,251 --> 01:29:02,252
They've been dealing under the table,
and I'm going to stop them.

1072
01:29:02,337 --> 01:29:05,422
I'm going to find my weapons
and destroy them.

1073
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:07,424
Tony,

1074
01:29:09,761 --> 01:29:11,636
you know that
I would help you with anything,

1075
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:15,682
but I cannot help you if
you're going to start all of this again.

1076
01:29:15,767 --> 01:29:19,394
There is nothing except this.
There's no art opening.

1077
01:29:19,645 --> 01:29:22,856
There is no benefit.
There is nothing to sign.

1078
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:27,069
There is the next mission
and nothing else.

1079
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,613
Is that so?

1080
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:33,283
Well, then, I quit.

1081
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:37,996
You stood by my side all these years

1082
01:29:38,081 --> 01:29:40,916
while I reaped
the benefits of destruction.

1083
01:29:41,209 --> 01:29:43,043
And now that I'm trying
to protect the people

1084
01:29:43,127 --> 01:29:44,961
that I put in harm's way,
you're going to walk out?

1085
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:49,508
You're going to kill yourself, Tony.
I'm not going to be a part of it.

1086
01:29:49,592 --> 01:29:51,593
I shouldn't be alive,

1087
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:55,013
unless it was for a reason.

1088
01:29:55,848 --> 01:29:57,724
I'm not crazy, Pepper.

1089
01:29:58,226 --> 01:30:01,395
I just finally know what I have to do.

1090
01:30:05,733 --> 01:30:08,527
And I know in my heart that it's right.

1091
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,670
You're all I have, too, you know.

1092
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:41,077
Sector 16?
What are you up to, Obadiah?

1093
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:58,303
You did not tell us that the target you
paid us to kill was the great Tony Stark.

1094
01:31:58,387 --> 01:31:59,930
- As you can see, Obadiah Stane...
- Oh, my God.

1095
01:32:00,014 --> 01:32:02,724
...your deception and lies
will cost you dearly.

1096
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:05,519
The price to kill Tony Stark
has just gone up.

1097
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:13,944
So, what are we going to do about this?

1098
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:29,209
I know what you're going through,
Pepper.

1099
01:32:36,926 --> 01:32:40,637
Tony. He always gets the good stuff,
doesn't he?

1100
01:33:02,243 --> 01:33:06,621
I was so happy when he came home.

1101
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:09,499
It was like we got him back
from the dead.

1102
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,504
Now I realize,

1103
01:33:16,841 --> 01:33:20,093
well, Tony never really did
come home, did he?

1104
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:24,514
He left a part of himself in that cave.

1105
01:33:27,310 --> 01:33:28,893
Breaks my heart.

1106
01:33:31,188 --> 01:33:35,191
Well, he's a complicated person.

1107
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:41,281
He's been through a lot.
I think he'll be all right.

1108
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:50,373
You are a very rare woman.

1109
01:33:52,877 --> 01:33:55,045
Tony doesn't know how lucky he is.

1110
01:33:57,757 --> 01:33:59,758
Thank you. Thanks.

1111
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,803
I'd better get back there.

1112
01:34:09,268 --> 01:34:11,311
Is that today's paper?

1113
01:34:12,938 --> 01:34:14,022
Yes.

1114
01:34:14,774 --> 01:34:16,191
Do you mind?

1115
01:34:16,776 --> 01:34:18,610
- Not at all.
- Puzzle.

1116
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:20,028
Of course.

1117
01:34:23,491 --> 01:34:24,824
Take care.

1118
01:34:48,974 --> 01:34:51,851
Ms. Potts? We had an appointment.
Did you forget about our appointment?

1119
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:53,478
Nope, right now. Come with me.

1120
01:34:53,562 --> 01:34:54,688
- Right now?
- We're going to have it right now.

1121
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:56,564
- Yeah, walk with me.
- Okay.

1122
01:34:57,733 --> 01:34:59,859
I'm going to give you the meeting
of your life. Your office.

1123
01:35:01,445 --> 01:35:04,280
Yeah, we've been working
our best to do it.

1124
01:35:04,657 --> 01:35:08,201
Absolutely, we're...
I'm going to have to call you back.

1125
01:35:08,411 --> 01:35:11,079
Mr. Stane? Sir, we've explored

1126
01:35:11,163 --> 01:35:13,415
what you've asked us, and it seems
as though there's a little hiccup.

1127
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:15,208
- Actually...
- A hiccup?

1128
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:19,129
Yes, to power the suit, sir,
the technology actually doesn't exist.

1129
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:22,465
- So it's...
- Wait, wait, wait. The technology?

1130
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:28,555
William, here is the technology.
I've asked you to simply make it smaller.

1131
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:32,600
Okay, sir, and that's what we're trying
to do, but honestly, it's impossible.

1132
01:35:32,685 --> 01:35:39,315
Tony Stark was able to build this
in a cave! With a box of scraps!

1133
01:35:41,485 --> 01:35:44,571
Well, I'm sorry. I'm not Tony Stark.

1134
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:01,671
Tony?

1135
01:36:04,425 --> 01:36:07,719
Tony, are you there? Hello?

1136
01:36:09,305 --> 01:36:10,513
Breathe.

1137
01:36:11,682 --> 01:36:14,434
Easy, easy.

1138
01:36:16,520 --> 01:36:18,813
You remember this one, right?

1139
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:22,817
It's a shame the government
didn't approve it.

1140
01:36:22,902 --> 01:36:27,030
There's so many applications
for causing short-term paralysis.

1141
01:36:29,366 --> 01:36:30,658
Tony.

1142
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:37,332
When I ordered the hit on you,

1143
01:36:39,919 --> 01:36:42,420
I worried that I was

1144
01:36:45,466 --> 01:36:47,509
killing the golden goose.

1145
01:36:48,844 --> 01:36:52,597
But, you see, it was just

1146
01:36:53,933 --> 01:36:56,226
fate that you survived that.

1147
01:37:01,273 --> 01:37:05,151
You had one last golden egg to give.

1148
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:14,619
Do you really think that just because
you have an idea, it belongs to you?

1149
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:23,670
Your father, he helped give us
the atomic bomb.

1150
01:37:23,754 --> 01:37:28,007
Now, what kind of world would it be
today if he was as selfish as you?

1151
01:37:37,977 --> 01:37:39,644
Oh, it's beautiful.

1152
01:37:42,273 --> 01:37:47,110
Tony, this is your Ninth Symphony.

1153
01:37:49,405 --> 01:37:51,865
What a masterpiece. Look at that.

1154
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:54,993
This is your legacy.

1155
01:37:57,538 --> 01:38:02,750
A new generation of weapons
with this at its heart.

1156
01:38:05,963 --> 01:38:09,674
Weapons that will help steer the world
back on course,

1157
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:12,010
put the balance of power in our hands.

1158
01:38:13,596 --> 01:38:15,221
The right hands.

1159
01:38:18,350 --> 01:38:22,896
I wish you could see my prototype.

1160
01:38:24,315 --> 01:38:25,815
It's not as...

1161
01:38:27,151 --> 01:38:30,153
Well, not as conservative as yours.

1162
01:38:32,156 --> 01:38:34,991
Too bad you had to involve Pepper
in this.

1163
01:38:35,451 --> 01:38:38,036
I would have preferred that she lived.

1164
01:38:51,050 --> 01:38:53,343
What do you mean,
he paid to have Tony killed?

1165
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:56,054
Pepper, slow down.
Why would Obadiah...

1166
01:38:57,306 --> 01:38:58,598
Okay, where's Tony now?

1167
01:38:58,682 --> 01:39:00,391
I don't know.
He's not answering his phone.

1168
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,602
Please go over there
and make sure everything's okay.

1169
01:39:02,686 --> 01:39:05,313
Thank you, Rhodey. I know a shortcut.

1170
01:40:11,630 --> 01:40:12,922
Good boy.

1171
01:40:52,755 --> 01:41:03,723
Tony?

1172
01:41:06,393 --> 01:41:07,477
Tony!

1173
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:11,981
Tony! You okay?

1174
01:41:12,316 --> 01:41:15,943
- Where's Pepper?
- She's fine. She's with five agents.

1175
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:18,362
They're about to arrest Obadiah.

1176
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:20,615
That's not going to be enough.

1177
01:41:44,431 --> 01:41:50,436
Section 16. Section 16. There it is.

1178
01:41:59,446 --> 01:42:02,115
My key's not working.
It's not opening the door.

1179
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:04,367
Oh, wow! What's that?
It's, like, a little device?

1180
01:42:04,451 --> 01:42:05,868
It's, like, a thing that's going
to pick the lock?

1181
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:08,704
You might want to take
a few steps back.

1182
01:42:27,266 --> 01:42:29,809
That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

1183
01:42:29,893 --> 01:42:32,687
Not bad, huh? Let's do it.

1184
01:42:39,361 --> 01:42:41,737
You need me to do anything else?

1185
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:44,115
Keep the skies clear.

1186
01:42:49,246 --> 01:42:50,538
Damn!

1187
01:42:58,589 --> 01:43:00,256
Next time, baby.

1188
01:43:30,370 --> 01:43:33,748
Looks like you were right.
He was building a suit.

1189
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:36,334
I thought it'd be bigger.

1190
01:44:21,171 --> 01:44:22,338
Take him out!

1191
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:35,059
How do you think the Mark I
chest piece is going to hold up?

1192
01:44:35,143 --> 01:44:37,436
The suit's at 48% power and falling, sir.

1193
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,231
That chest piece
was never designed for sustained flight.

1194
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:41,857
Keep me posted.

1195
01:44:43,610 --> 01:44:44,610
Pepper!

1196
01:44:44,695 --> 01:44:47,697
- Tony! Tony, are you okay?
- I'm fine. How are...

1197
01:44:47,781 --> 01:44:49,699
- Obadiah, he's gone insane!
- I know.

1198
01:44:49,783 --> 01:44:51,575
- Listen, you'd better get out of there.
- He built a suit.

1199
01:44:51,660 --> 01:44:53,119
Get out of there right now!

1200
01:45:04,965 --> 01:45:07,300
Where do you think you're going?

1201
01:45:12,806 --> 01:45:15,808
Your services are no longer required.

1202
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,476
Stane!

1203
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,337
I love this suit!

1204
01:45:44,421 --> 01:45:47,673
- Put them down!
- Collateral damage, Tony.

1205
01:45:49,217 --> 01:45:51,260
Divert power to chest RT.

1206
01:45:59,978 --> 01:46:02,104
Power reduced to 19%.

1207
01:46:09,946 --> 01:46:11,072
Lady!

1208
01:46:12,949 --> 01:46:14,992
No, no, no, no, no, no!

1209
01:46:37,057 --> 01:46:40,017
For 30 years, I've been holding you up!

1210
01:46:44,481 --> 01:46:46,941
I built this company from nothing!

1211
01:46:49,194 --> 01:46:51,779
Nothing is going to stand in my way.

1212
01:46:58,036 --> 01:47:00,579
Least of all you!

1213
01:47:10,006 --> 01:47:13,259
Impressive!
You've upgraded your armor!

1214
01:47:13,844 --> 01:47:16,554
I've made some upgrades of my own!

1215
01:47:24,896 --> 01:47:26,856
Sir, it appears that his suit can fly.

1216
01:47:26,940 --> 01:47:28,607
Duly noted.
Take me to maximum altitude.

1217
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:30,985
With only 15% power,
the odds of reaching that...

1218
01:47:31,069 --> 01:47:33,237
I know the math! Do it!

1219
01:47:41,538 --> 01:47:43,831
Sir, you're not going to believe this.
That thing is back.

1220
01:47:43,915 --> 01:47:46,542
Get me Major Allen. Scramble the jets!

1221
01:47:49,254 --> 01:47:52,256
Not necessary, people.
Just a training exercise.

1222
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:53,591
Yes, sir.

1223
01:48:01,558 --> 01:48:03,476
- Thirteen percent power, sir.
- Climb!

1224
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:09,523
- Eleven percent.
- Keep going!

1225
01:48:16,239 --> 01:48:18,365
- Seven percent power.
- Just leave it on the screen!

1226
01:48:18,450 --> 01:48:20,075
Stop telling me!

1227
01:48:29,753 --> 01:48:34,340
You had a great idea, Tony, but my
suit is more advanced in every way!

1228
01:48:34,925 --> 01:48:36,967
How'd you solve the icing problem?

1229
01:48:37,052 --> 01:48:38,552
Icing problem?

1230
01:48:40,764 --> 01:48:43,098
Might want to look into it.

1231
01:48:54,778 --> 01:48:56,111
Two percent.

1232
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:01,116
We are now running
on emergency backup power.

1233
01:49:12,754 --> 01:49:16,215
- Potts!
- Tony! Oh, my God, are you okay?

1234
01:49:16,299 --> 01:49:20,427
I'm almost out of power. I've got to get
out of this thing. I'll be right there.

1235
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,929
Nice try!

1236
01:49:34,484 --> 01:49:38,612
- Weapons status?
- Repulsors offline. Missiles offline.

1237
01:49:42,867 --> 01:49:44,451
Flares!

1238
01:49:52,961 --> 01:49:55,004
Very clever, Tony.

1239
01:50:00,343 --> 01:50:02,803
- Potts?
- Tony!

1240
01:50:02,887 --> 01:50:03,887
This isn't working.

1241
01:50:03,972 --> 01:50:06,265
We're going to have to overload
the reactor and blast the roof.

1242
01:50:06,349 --> 01:50:09,226
- Well, how are you going to do that?
- You're going to do it.

1243
01:50:09,311 --> 01:50:11,770
Go to the central console,
open up all the circuits.

1244
01:50:11,855 --> 01:50:13,272
When I get clear of the roof,
I'll let you know.

1245
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:15,941
You're going to hit
the master bypass button.

1246
01:50:16,026 --> 01:50:17,401
It's going to fry everything up here.

1247
01:50:19,571 --> 01:50:21,864
Okay. I'm going in now.

1248
01:50:21,948 --> 01:50:25,200
Make sure you wait till I clear the roof.
I'll buy you some time.

1249
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:36,545
This looks important!

1250
01:50:57,400 --> 01:51:00,194
I never had a taste for this sort of thing,

1251
01:51:00,278 --> 01:51:04,406
but I must admit,
I'm deeply enjoying the suit!

1252
01:51:12,666 --> 01:51:15,167
You finally outdid yourself, Tony!

1253
01:51:17,545 --> 01:51:19,672
You'd have made your father proud!

1254
01:51:24,636 --> 01:51:27,137
It's ready, Tony! Get off the roof!

1255
01:51:46,658 --> 01:51:47,991
Tony!

1256
01:51:49,202 --> 01:51:50,828
How ironic, Tony!

1257
01:51:52,622 --> 01:51:57,543
Trying to rid the world of weapons,
you gave it its best one ever!

1258
01:51:57,794 --> 01:52:03,674
- Pepper!
- And now I'm going to kill you with it!

1259
01:52:06,720 --> 01:52:10,556
- You ripped out my targeting system!
- Time to hit the button!

1260
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:14,643
- You told me not to!
- Hold still, you little prick!

1261
01:52:16,688 --> 01:52:19,273
- Just do it!
- You'll die!

1262
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,861
Push it!

1263
01:53:21,419 --> 01:53:23,212
Tony!

1264
01:53:31,638 --> 01:53:33,764
You've all received the official
statement of what occurred

1265
01:53:33,848 --> 01:53:36,141
at Stark Industries last night.

1266
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:41,021
There have been unconfirmed reports
that a robotic prototype malfunctioned

1267
01:53:41,105 --> 01:53:43,732
and caused damage to the arc reactor.

1268
01:53:44,442 --> 01:53:46,693
Fortunately, a member
of Tony Stark's personal security staff...

1269
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:48,695
"Iron Man." That's kind of catchy.
It's got a nice ring to it.

1270
01:53:48,780 --> 01:53:52,449
I mean, it's not technically accurate.
The suit's a gold-titanium alloy,

1271
01:53:52,534 --> 01:53:55,160
but it's kind of evocative,
the imagery, anyway.

1272
01:53:55,245 --> 01:53:56,912
Here's your alibi.

1273
01:53:57,747 --> 01:53:58,831
Okay.

1274
01:53:58,915 --> 01:54:01,083
- You were on your yacht.
- Yeah.

1275
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:03,293
We have port papers that put you
in Avalon all night,

1276
01:54:03,378 --> 01:54:05,087
and sworn statements
from 50 of your guests.

1277
01:54:05,171 --> 01:54:08,298
See, I was thinking maybe we should
say it was just Pepper and me

1278
01:54:08,383 --> 01:54:10,175
alone on the island.

1279
01:54:11,469 --> 01:54:12,761
- That's what happened.
- All right.

1280
01:54:12,846 --> 01:54:14,972
Just read it, word for word.

1281
01:54:16,891 --> 01:54:18,892
There's nothing about Stane here.

1282
01:54:18,977 --> 01:54:21,770
That's being handled. He's on vacation.

1283
01:54:22,647 --> 01:54:25,107
Small aircraft have
such a poor safety record.

1284
01:54:25,191 --> 01:54:27,693
But what about the whole cover story
that it's a bodyguard?

1285
01:54:27,777 --> 01:54:30,696
He's my... I mean, is that...
That's kind of flimsy, don't you think?

1286
01:54:30,780 --> 01:54:33,073
This isn't my first rodeo, Mr. Stark.

1287
01:54:33,157 --> 01:54:37,160
Just stick to the official statement,
and soon, this will all be behind you.

1288
01:54:37,245 --> 01:54:39,496
You've got 90 seconds.

1289
01:54:42,375 --> 01:54:44,042
Agent Coulson?

1290
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:49,214
I just wanted to say thank you very much
for all of your help.

1291
01:54:49,299 --> 01:54:52,217
That's what we do.
You'll be hearing from us.

1292
01:54:52,468 --> 01:54:55,846
- From the Strategic Homeland...
- Just call us S.H.I.E.L.D.

1293
01:54:56,180 --> 01:54:57,347
Right.

1294
01:54:58,308 --> 01:55:02,227
- Let's get this show on the road.
- You know, it's actually not that bad.

1295
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:04,605
Even I don't think I'm Iron Man.

1296
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:06,231
- You're not Iron Man.
- Am so.

1297
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:08,775
- You're not.
- All right, suit yourself.

1298
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:12,863
You know, if I were Iron Man, I'd have
this girlfriend who knew my true identity.

1299
01:55:12,947 --> 01:55:15,490
She'd be a wreck, 'cause she'd always
be worrying that I was going to die,

1300
01:55:15,575 --> 01:55:17,951
yet so proud of the man I'd become.

1301
01:55:18,036 --> 01:55:21,788
She'd be wildly conflicted,
which would only make her more

1302
01:55:23,499 --> 01:55:24,541
crazy about me.

1303
01:55:24,626 --> 01:55:26,293
Tell me you never think about that night.

1304
01:55:26,377 --> 01:55:28,253
- What night?
- You know.

1305
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:36,970
Are you talking about the night that
we danced and went up on the roof,

1306
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:44,186
and then you went downstairs
to get me a drink,

1307
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:47,522
and you left me there, by myself?

1308
01:55:48,733 --> 01:55:51,276
Is that the night you're talking about?

1309
01:55:53,446 --> 01:55:54,529
Thought so.

1310
01:55:57,241 --> 01:56:00,994
- Will that be all, Mr. Stark?
- Yes, that will be all, Miss Potts.

1311
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:04,623
And now, Mr. Stark has
prepared a statement.

1312
01:56:04,707 --> 01:56:07,751
He will not be taking any questions.
Thank you.

1313
01:56:11,923 --> 01:56:17,052
Been a while since I was in front of you.
I figure I'll stick to the cards this time.

1314
01:56:19,013 --> 01:56:22,057
There's been speculation that I was
involved in the events that occurred

1315
01:56:22,141 --> 01:56:23,433
on the freeway and the rooftop...

1316
01:56:23,518 --> 01:56:26,311
I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that

1317
01:56:26,396 --> 01:56:30,148
that was a bodyguard
in a suit that conveniently appeared,

1318
01:56:30,233 --> 01:56:33,318
- despite the fact that you...
- I know that it's confusing.

1319
01:56:33,403 --> 01:56:37,030
It is one thing to question the official
story, and another thing entirely

1320
01:56:37,115 --> 01:56:40,367
to make wild accusations,
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.

1321
01:56:40,451 --> 01:56:42,077
I never said you were a superhero.

1322
01:56:42,161 --> 01:56:47,499
Didn't? Well, good, because that would
be outlandish and fantastic.

1323
01:56:49,502 --> 01:56:52,754
I'm just not the hero type. Clearly.

1324
01:56:53,297 --> 01:56:56,258
With this laundry list
of character defects,

1325
01:56:56,342 --> 01:56:57,801
all the mistakes I've made,

1326
01:56:57,885 --> 01:57:01,221
- largely public.
- Just stick to the cards, man.

1327
01:57:01,305 --> 01:57:02,973
Yeah, okay. Yeah.

1328
01:57:05,101 --> 01:57:06,601
The truth is

1329
01:57:12,775 --> 01:57:14,276
I am Iron Man.

1330
02:05:17,510 --> 02:05:18,760
Jarvis!

1331
02:05:18,844 --> 02:05:20,595
Welcome home, sir.

1332
02:05:24,016 --> 02:05:29,521
"I am Iron Man." You think you're
the only superhero in the world?

1333
02:05:29,855 --> 02:05:33,107
Mr. Stark, you've become part
of a bigger universe.

1334
02:05:33,192 --> 02:05:34,984
You just don't know it yet.

1335
02:05:35,486 --> 02:05:37,278
Who the hell are you?

1336
02:05:37,488 --> 02:05:40,198
Nick Fury, Director of S.H.I.E.L.D.

1337
02:05:42,284 --> 02:05:45,286
I'm here to talk to you
about the Avenger Initiative.
