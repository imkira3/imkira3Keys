I don't want to wear these,
do you have anything else?

167
00:18:46,985 --> 00:18:50,511
Only things clients have
left behind, in the trunk.

168
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,572
When I came in, was there
another man with me?

169
00:19:06,672 --> 00:19:08,451
Bright blue eyes.

170
00:19:08,632 --> 00:19:10,625
I don't know.

171
00:19:23,689 --> 00:19:25,847
Nine minutes, 47 seconds.

172
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:33,140
Okay, get dressed.

173
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:35,643
- Why?
- We're leaving.

174
00:19:35,826 --> 00:19:39,396
No, no, no. I'm never allowed
to leave. Sergio owns me.

175
00:19:41,915 --> 00:19:44,157
I'm gonna handle Sergio.

176
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:47,571
And you're gonna do what I tell you,
do you understand me?

177
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:51,621
My, my. We haven't changed
much at all, have we?

178
00:19:55,596 --> 00:19:57,754
Hurry up.

179

(MUSIC PLAYING)

180
00:20:01,727 --> 00:20:03,212
What is this music?

181
00:20:03,312 --> 00:20:05,464
Sergio's favorite. He plays
it throughout the house

182
00:20:05,564 --> 00:20:08,801
to remind girls and
clients who is in charge.

183
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:11,845
Well, like I said,
I'm gonna deal with Sergio.

184
00:20:11,945 --> 00:20:14,768
No, I expect he'll
be dealing with you.

185
00:20:20,996 --> 00:20:22,606
Why do you do this?

186
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,608
Why do any of us do anything?

187
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:27,403
Yeah, but you don't like it, you're not
feeding a habit, so why are you here?

188
00:20:27,503 --> 00:20:29,571
Life has brought me here.

189
00:20:29,671 --> 00:20:31,824
So if you weren't here,
what would you be doing?

190
00:20:31,924 --> 00:20:33,534
Go back to my hometown.

191
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:34,994
Finish nursing school.

192
00:20:35,094 --> 00:20:36,203
What's your town like?

193
00:20:36,303 --> 00:20:37,454
This is pointless.

196
00:20:40,265 --> 00:20:41,583
Quiet.

197
00:20:41,683 --> 00:20:43,795
Under a mountain.

198
00:20:44,186 --> 00:20:45,963
Nice houses with brightly painted

199

white picket fences.

200
00:20:48,774 --> 00:20:50,175
I miss it.

201
00:20:50,275 --> 00:20:52,094
So like I said, why are you here?

202
00:20:52,194 --> 00:20:53,971
My son was sick.

203
00:20:54,071 --> 00:20:57,308
His care was very expensive, I had
to borrow a lot of money, quickly.

204
00:20:57,408 --> 00:20:59,352
I didn't know where to go.

205
00:21:00,244 --> 00:21:02,236
So I came here.

206
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:06,573
When you owe somebody
that much, they own you.

207
00:21:07,167 --> 00:21:09,030
So how is your boy now?

208
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:12,656
His name is Eden.

209
00:21:14,174 --> 00:21:15,989
He died.

210
00:21:17,261 --> 00:21:19,123
I'm sorry.

211
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:21,206

He doesn't speak much English.

I'm not entirely sure.

234
00:22:22,117 --> 00:22:24,394
But you're welcome
to try and find out.

235
00:22:48,977 --> 00:22:50,922
Come on now!

236
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:31,165
Hey!

00:23:49,913 --> 00:23:52,487
I think we can help each other.

Please, please don't scream.

239
00:24:03,135 --> 00:24:05,204
Here, take this.

240
00:24:05,304 --> 00:24:07,539
That's enough for you
to get away from Sergio.

241
00:24:07,639 --> 00:24:09,375
I just need you to do me a favor.

242
00:24:09,475 --> 00:24:12,544
I need you to go to the police,
and I need you to tell them about me.

I kidnapped a child called Alex,
and I shot his mother...

244
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:17,549
If you want to be arrested,
why not just go turn yourself in?

245
00:24:17,649 --> 00:24:20,302
'Cause I only get 10 minutes,
and when I change I won't want to.

will not stop until he's found me.

- Fuck you.
- You want some more?

Let's go again, right now!

272

Wait. We've gotta give him, what?
Five, 10 minutes? Right, Doc?

Doc.

274

We can't break him with one hand
tied behind our backs like this.

You don't know how it is with Leonid.

Leonid.

277
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:08,322
Two years we've been
processing him, not a peep.

278
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:12,455
Now, the old doctor, he was
real big on prisoner's rights.

279
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:14,703
How about the rights
of ordinary, decent people

280
00:28:14,803 --> 00:28:17,122
to sleep peacefully in
their beds at night

281
00:28:17,222 --> 00:28:19,963
without worrying about
a sick fuck like him?

282
00:28:20,809 --> 00:28:23,418
How about letting us
bend the rules a little?

283

Where are we?

284

Are you fucking with me?
You don't know where we are?

285
00:28:30,736 --> 00:28:32,764
Is there a problem?

286
00:28:33,739 --> 00:28:36,100
Come on, Doc. What the fuck?

287
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,810
You know where we are is classified,

288
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:39,985
and if you don't, I can't tell you.

289
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:41,941
Okay.

290
00:28:45,709 --> 00:28:48,236
He's having some kind of episode.

291
00:28:48,545 --> 00:28:52,697
We should just do what we've got to do.
He's not going to tell anyone.

292
00:28:55,094 --> 00:28:57,086
There was a boy.

293
00:28:57,930 --> 00:28:59,922

294
00:29:00,933 --> 00:29:03,293
And there was a girl,
Dana, a prostitute.

295
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:04,837
She was helping me,
and then Sergio...

296

What are you talking about?
Just do your fucking job!

I kidnapped a kid.

I don't know where he
is now, because I'm me...

00:29:17,199 --> 00:29:19,685
I mean, I am the "me" I am now.

301
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:22,730
But soon I will change and I'll know,
but I won't want to tell you.

302
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,523
Now, I know how this sounds.
I know this sounds crazy,

but please, you have to believe me.

304
00:29:26,166 --> 00:29:28,574
There's a child's life at stake.

305
00:29:32,464 --> 00:29:34,623
He's got something strapped to him.

An airborne pathogen

particularly baroque fashion.

some extra eyes, say.

We show them it works.

We threaten to release it over
some densely populated cities.

367
00:34:34,141 --> 00:34:37,841
And we all grow obscenely rich.

368

Yeah, about that.

369
00:34:42,941 --> 00:34:44,426

- Mmm.

371
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:51,520
Well, actually, Leonid,

372
00:34:51,658 --> 00:34:54,728
we may have mislead you, somewhat.

373
00:34:54,828 --> 00:34:59,108
I mean, do we need
your expertise? Yes.

374
00:34:59,208 --> 00:35:02,363
Do we need you to build
this bespoke virus? Yes.

375
00:35:02,669 --> 00:35:06,288
But are we going to blackmail
governments for money?

376
00:35:07,257 --> 00:35:09,120
No.

377
00:35:09,259 --> 00:35:11,036
No, we're not.

378
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:15,620
We're not interested in blackmail here,
and we don't need money.

379

You may not understand this,

380

but our ambitions are a little

381

wider.

not agree to the cause.

here until this one's over.

391
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:33,039
A change of plans, I think.

392

What nonsense this is, I do not know.

393

You have ceased to be of use.

395
00:36:42,436 --> 00:36:45,005
So thank you very
much for my freedom,

396
00:36:45,105 --> 00:36:48,008
and an excellent place to work.

397

Hello, Ryan.

Pulse normal.

Within tolerance.
The ports are clear.

429
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:44,458
There's nothing wrong with the

00:38:44,558 --> 00:38:46,543
old receiver tech.
It's embedded nicely.

431

The vocal chords have been disabled,

432
00:38:47,978 --> 00:38:50,839
and I've fixed the self-inflicted
damage on the right side of the neck

433
00:38:50,939 --> 00:38:53,175
and opened the node
portal on the left.

00:38:53,275 --> 00:38:55,010
I've gone over all the
transmission equipment.

00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,055
It's working perfectly.

436
00:38:58,113 --> 00:39:03,852
So, it has to be a fault or
interference with the satellite.

437
00:39:04,369 --> 00:39:06,146
Quite frankly, there's nothing
we can do about that,

438
00:39:06,246 --> 00:39:10,235
'cause it might just happen more,
and possibly more randomly.

just slit this vein.

Hello, Ryan.

454

It's a crude solution,
I admit, laughably simple.

00:40:26,869 --> 00:40:28,228
My idea.

456

Your entrance, we noted, was marked
by a moment of involuntary spasm.

something that no one else can.

genetically code and engineer a virus.

Made you grow extra lungs.
Only they wouldn't stop growing.

732
01:02:58,804 --> 01:03:00,581
To stop it going global we
had to scorch the earth

733
01:03:00,681 --> 01:03:02,750
for 100 miles around his lab.

734

Now, Leonid out,
cooking up viruses in a lab?

735

We can't let that happen.

800
01:06:36,980 --> 01:06:39,675
You should have been chained the
moment the fugues started, Father.

801
01:06:39,775 --> 01:06:41,844
Ryan nearly destroyed
the whole project.

802
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:43,304
The solar flares are settling,

803
01:06:43,404 --> 01:06:45,723
and they will no longer be
effecting the satellite's signal.

804
01:06:45,823 --> 01:06:47,933
One, maybe two episodes at most.

805
01:06:48,033 --> 01:06:49,768
So you gave the
satellite a high orbit.

806
01:06:49,868 --> 01:06:52,730
I didn't know solar storms were going
to interfere with the satellite.

807
01:06:52,830 --> 01:06:54,231
It's an 11-year cycle. This size?

808
01:06:54,331 --> 01:06:55,649
It's once every thousand years.

809
01:06:55,749 --> 01:06:57,484
- How am I...
- You should've checked all eventualities.

810
01:06:57,584 --> 01:07:01,697
I did. I've sacrificed so much.
I have worked so hard.

811
01:07:01,797 --> 01:07:06,281
You demanded obedience, and I
obeyed and succeeded, despite this.

812
01:07:09,430 --> 01:07:11,165
You're right.

813
01:07:11,265 --> 01:07:14,251
Your behavior these last few
months has impressed me.

814
01:07:14,351 --> 01:07:15,586
Thank you.

815
01:07:15,686 --> 01:07:20,846
I may not often say, but I
am proud to be your father.

816
01:07:24,069 --> 01:07:26,181
Embrace me, son!

817
01:08:35,349 --> 01:08:36,997
Ryan.

818
01:08:40,354 --> 01:08:42,512
Clever, I admit.

819
01:08:46,193 --> 01:08:47,761
But what now?

820
01:08:47,861 --> 01:08:49,305
Save that kid?

821
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:52,311
From out here, the middle of nowhere?

822
01:08:52,741 --> 01:08:55,766
In the amount of time
that you have left?

823
01:08:56,120 --> 01:08:59,144
I don't see that happening, do you?

824
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:04,320
Just enjoy the sun on
your skin, breeze in your face.

825
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:08,704
Bird singing.

826
01:09:11,885 --> 01:09:15,171
I have a suggestion.
Let's have a drink.

827
01:09:15,681 --> 01:09:20,129
I'll show you a picture of your wife.
You remember her, don't you?

828
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:31,051
Come.

829
01:09:39,788 --> 01:09:41,733
Have a seat.

830
01:09:44,042 --> 01:09:46,534
I get it Ryan. I do.

831
01:09:48,046 --> 01:09:49,990
Did I ever tell you about my mom?

832
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:52,785
She was 35. She was killed
along with 26 other people

833
01:09:52,885 --> 01:09:58,165
by a solo crazed gunman who
didn't wanna pay taxes anymore.

834
01:09:58,265 --> 01:10:00,377
Now, how is that fair?

835
01:10:00,559 --> 01:10:02,294
He did the wrong thing.

836
01:10:02,394 --> 01:10:05,003
I'm doing the right thing.

837
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:12,262
Just like your wife.
She's gone. Move on.

838
01:10:12,362 --> 01:10:15,849
Don't spend the few remaining
fragments of your life suffering.

839
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,437
Enjoy them.

840
01:10:18,577 --> 01:10:21,605
To living every moment
as if it were your last.

841
01:10:21,705 --> 01:10:23,235
You're right.

842
01:10:24,917 --> 01:10:27,194
So now I know what I need to do.

843
01:10:41,767 --> 01:10:43,712
What's the point?

844
01:11:45,164 --> 01:11:48,615
You don't wanna do that.
You'll kill us both.

845
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:26,206
You followed me.

846
01:13:26,306 --> 01:13:28,584
Following, watching,
everywhere just like you asked.

847
01:13:28,684 --> 01:13:31,253
I used the money you
left me and the truth is,

848
01:13:31,353 --> 01:13:33,839
<i>no one's been as good to me as you.</i>

849
01:13:33,939 --> 01:13:35,674
Ever.

850
01:13:35,774 --> 01:13:37,968
There isn't anytime.

851
01:13:39,153 --> 01:13:42,308
So you might as well just let me die.

852
01:13:42,489 --> 01:13:45,644
Will you, Ryan, come back again?

853
01:13:47,619 --> 01:13:49,688
Maybe once or twice.

854
01:13:49,788 --> 01:13:52,315
That's enough to save the boy.

855
01:13:54,084 --> 01:13:56,695
We both have lost people
that we care about.

856
01:13:56,795 --> 01:13:59,452
We shouldn't lose this kid.

857
01:14:01,592 --> 01:14:03,584
Put these on before you change.

858
01:14:11,351 --> 01:14:13,510
Why are you really helping me?

859
01:14:14,313 --> 01:14:16,590
What else do I have?

860
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:26,934
(RYAN GROANS)

861
01:14:27,034 --> 01:14:29,856
- (BANGING ON DOOR)
- Hey!

862
01:14:53,852 --> 01:14:56,213
Reply, Eden.

863
01:14:59,650 --> 01:15:01,559
(CHAINS RATTLING)

864
01:15:06,365 --> 01:15:08,357
Right answer, hero.

865
01:15:09,284 --> 01:15:11,063
- How long?
- Three days.

866
01:15:13,747 --> 01:15:16,108
We're not far,
but we haven't much time.

867
01:15:16,208 --> 01:15:17,985
The other guy's been looking.

868
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:19,862
Ten minutes till you
change back, right?

869
01:15:19,962 --> 01:15:22,204
Yeah.

870
01:15:26,718 --> 01:15:28,414
Here you go.

871
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,754
All right. Let's roll.

872
01:15:50,951 --> 01:15:53,771
This is where it's all going down.
Whatever it is.

873
01:15:53,871 --> 01:15:55,685
Hibiscus.

874
01:15:55,914 --> 01:15:59,449
I started a countdown.
So you'll know.

875
01:16:02,087 --> 01:16:06,832
Okay, I need you to listen to me.
You need to run now.

876
01:16:07,259 --> 01:16:09,119
'Cause if you see me again,
it won't be me.

877
01:16:09,219 --> 01:16:10,162
- Do you understand?
- No.

878
01:16:10,262 --> 01:16:11,288
- Yes. Yes.
- No!

879
01:16:11,388 --> 01:16:14,621
- Listen, I'm trying to save your life.
- No. No.

880
01:16:22,941 --> 01:16:24,637
(BEEPING)

881
01:16:25,861 --> 01:16:28,222
<i>AUTOMATED VOICE:
Welcome, Dr. Langham.</i>

882
01:17:37,599 --> 01:17:42,261
<i>I've made your virus,
integrated the biotechnology.</i>

883
01:17:43,272 --> 01:17:47,424
<i>Now let my son go,
you bastards. Let him go!</i>

884
01:17:48,402 --> 01:17:50,726
<i>I'll have to test it.</i>

885
01:18:27,649 --> 01:18:30,970
- They killed Leonid...
- Drop the gun, Ryan.

886
01:18:34,073 --> 01:18:35,307
Dr. Langham.

887
01:18:35,407 --> 01:18:37,269
Yes!

888
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:43,607
Drop the gun or the boy dies.

889
01:18:49,755 --> 01:18:51,740
We took this subject
to test the new virus

890
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,784
when we rescued you from the plane.

891
01:18:53,884 --> 01:18:55,828
Or me, I should say.

892
01:18:55,928 --> 01:18:59,581
Less than a day, the body
assimilates imbedded picotech.

893
01:18:59,681 --> 01:19:01,125
Subject's online in two.

894
01:19:01,225 --> 01:19:04,961
New population-control
satellite's been launched.

895
01:19:06,271 --> 01:19:09,341
You're looking at the
first of the new breed.

896
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:10,968
I thought I was the first.

897
01:19:11,068 --> 01:19:12,800
Third actually.

898
01:19:13,070 --> 01:19:15,222
An expendable prototype.

899
01:19:15,322 --> 01:19:18,017
All I have to do is walk out there,

900
01:19:18,117 --> 01:19:21,020
and within days,
without them realizing it,

901
01:19:21,120 --> 01:19:23,939
people will be ready
to be controlled.

902
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:26,692
Ready to be given purpose,
my dear boy.

903
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:28,152
What do you plan to do with me?

904
01:19:28,252 --> 01:19:29,778
Nothing.

905
01:19:29,878 --> 01:19:32,823
Your satellite will be back
online in a few moments.

906
01:19:32,923 --> 01:19:35,699
I may just push white noise
through your signal,

907
01:19:35,968 --> 01:19:39,668
keep you around like my
favorite old pair of slippers.

908
01:19:43,308 --> 01:19:45,794
You won't be coming back again, Ryan.

909
01:19:45,894 --> 01:19:48,088
Any last requests?

910
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:51,175
A drink.

911
01:20:00,242 --> 01:20:02,934
I do have one more question.

912
01:20:05,998 --> 01:20:07,563
Why?

913
01:20:10,294 --> 01:20:13,319
You know how you control the masses?

914
01:20:16,216 --> 01:20:17,829
Fear.

915
01:20:18,927 --> 01:20:21,080
Humanity does appalling things.

916
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,086
Some of them, I've experienced.

917
01:20:24,808 --> 01:20:28,544
We saw so many tragic cases
come through the unit.

918
01:20:28,645 --> 01:20:30,798
It was sickening.

919
01:20:30,898 --> 01:20:34,219
War. War. War.

920
01:20:35,402 --> 01:20:39,186
Endless fighting and dying,
and dying and fighting.

921
01:20:39,656 --> 01:20:41,981
But in the world that I create,

922
01:20:42,201 --> 01:20:46,316
if you break my laws,
you will simply be switched off.

923
01:20:46,622 --> 01:20:48,982
Your signal overtaken.

924
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:53,654
And that fear will create
a beautiful future.

925
01:20:53,921 --> 01:20:56,032
A world without conflict.

926
01:20:56,173 --> 01:20:57,324
- A world of harmony.
- Harmony.

927
01:20:57,424 --> 01:20:59,203
Exactly!

928
01:21:00,302 --> 01:21:01,996
So why do you wish to stop me?

929
01:21:02,096 --> 01:21:04,206
Because I want my life back
and you don't have the right.

930
01:21:04,306 --> 01:21:07,627
Not only do I have the right.
It's my duty.

931
01:21:08,435 --> 01:21:13,548
Your life. You have no life.
I've been your life!

932
01:21:15,109 --> 01:21:19,221
I took you because you ended yours
when you allowed your wife to die,

933
01:21:19,321 --> 01:21:22,346
because you couldn't make a choice.

934
01:21:24,118 --> 01:21:27,854
It's important what you
read last thing at night.

935
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:32,321
It sets the tone of your sleep.

936
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:35,946
That was one of the many
things you taught me.

937
01:21:36,046 --> 01:21:39,201
I learnt so much from you.
So, so much.

938
01:21:39,675 --> 01:21:41,994
Things I'd never
even heard of before.

939
01:21:42,094 --> 01:21:44,086
Like valencies,

940
01:21:44,430 --> 01:21:48,545
isomers and chemical reactions.

941
01:22:41,570 --> 01:22:42,638
Did you meet him?

942
01:22:42,738 --> 01:22:44,303
He's dead.

943
01:22:45,115 --> 01:22:46,680
Doesn't matter.

944
01:22:47,409 --> 01:22:49,484
How about this beautiful
creature next?

945
01:22:52,122 --> 01:22:54,525
You're fond of her aren't you?

946
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:59,867
My dad likes her, too.
My mother had more class.

947
01:23:00,589 --> 01:23:02,534
But this isn't just for her.

948
01:23:03,383 --> 01:23:06,662
We need a new world and this is it.

949
01:23:06,762 --> 01:23:09,873
- Your dad's plan won't work, Harkin.
- I agree.

950
01:23:09,973 --> 01:23:13,419
My father's an idealist,
it doesn't mean he's wrong.

951
01:23:13,519 --> 01:23:16,757
You see, I put a little
more thought into it.

952
01:23:17,439 --> 01:23:21,468
There are no good guys and
bad guys, Ryan. Just opinions.

953
01:23:21,568 --> 01:23:26,015
But you know the right way to get
one individual controlling everyone?

954
01:23:26,115 --> 01:23:29,435
By having me controlling
the right individual.

955
01:23:29,535 --> 01:23:34,231
For example, let's just say a
particularly unstable world leader.

956
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:39,361
Control's inevitable in some form,
whether it's us or not.

957
01:23:40,754 --> 01:23:43,073
But this being airborne,
people are gonna purge their systems.

958
01:23:43,173 --> 01:23:45,743
They're gonna mimic the tech,
they're gonna destroy the satellites.

959
01:23:45,843 --> 01:23:47,745
I know that.

960
01:23:47,845 --> 01:23:50,706
But me having the right person,

961
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:53,792
doing the right thing to ensure
that this planet has a future.

962
01:23:53,892 --> 01:23:56,964
Now that makes sense, Ryan.

963
01:23:57,855 --> 01:24:00,381
That's how I'll remake the world.

964
01:24:02,025 --> 01:24:04,552
There's absolutely no
reason to stop me.

965
01:24:08,866 --> 01:24:11,101
You don't give up,
I infect her, we win.

966
01:24:11,201 --> 01:24:13,771
You shoot me, this falls,
it goes airborne, we win.

967
01:24:13,871 --> 01:24:16,896
You do nothing, you time out, I win.

968
01:24:17,040 --> 01:24:19,943
This is not a situation that
you can shoot yourself out of.

969
01:24:20,043 --> 01:24:22,072
I guess not.

970
01:24:22,254 --> 01:24:27,165
All this for a kid? You've caused
me so many problems, Ryan.

971
01:24:27,843 --> 01:24:30,537
So, I'm gonna let you watch me
inject her before you time out.

972
01:24:30,637 --> 01:24:33,499
Admittedly, it'll be a little
different for my father.

973
01:24:33,599 --> 01:24:37,127
Let's just see if he likes
being inside her once again.

974
01:24:37,227 --> 01:24:38,671
Something for him to toy around with

975
01:24:38,771 --> 01:24:41,674
before he ultimately realizes
that he's not needed anymore.

976
01:24:41,774 --> 01:24:43,050
She doesn't deserve that.

977
01:24:43,150 --> 01:24:44,551
Oh, I know that.

978
01:24:44,651 --> 01:24:48,767
But we should always try and do
what's right for our family, Ryan.

979
01:24:49,031 --> 01:24:51,474
You of all people should know that.

980
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:56,441
Missed.

981
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:10,460
(GROANS)

982
01:26:07,151 --> 01:26:09,179
Let's see how you like it!

983
01:26:11,321 --> 01:26:13,930
Hey, whore, say goodbye...

984
01:26:39,099 --> 01:26:41,341
(SCREAMING)

985
01:26:50,277 --> 01:26:54,227
Hey, Ryan. Come on. Come on up.

986
01:26:55,908 --> 01:26:59,857
You okay? Here. Here.

987
01:27:07,127 --> 01:27:08,821
His name's Alex.

988
01:27:08,921 --> 01:27:12,740
I want you to look after
him as if he were your own.

989
01:27:16,512 --> 01:27:18,622
Thank you so much.

990
01:27:18,722 --> 01:27:20,833
No! You don't have to do this.

991
01:27:20,933 --> 01:27:23,340
If I don't do it,
I'm gonna change back.

992
01:27:23,811 --> 01:27:26,337
Please! Please!

993
01:27:31,235 --> 01:27:33,310
- I'm sorry.
- No!

994
01:28:00,806 --> 01:28:02,620
Time's up!

995
01:28:16,405 --> 01:28:18,219
(GROANS)

996
01:28:18,449 --> 01:28:21,818
You okay? I got you.
Hang on. It's okay.

997
01:28:22,786 --> 01:28:24,980
Hang on a second.

998
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:29,659
Ryan?

999
01:29:34,983 --> 01:29:38,684
Hey, it's me.
It's okay now, it's over!

1000
01:29:40,364 --> 01:29:42,606
Harkin and Langham?

1001
01:29:42,741 --> 01:29:44,734
They're dead.

1002
01:29:51,959 --> 01:29:57,735
Look, I couldn't risk anyone else
tuning in, so I cut them out.

1003
01:30:10,727 --> 01:30:11,920
Where are we?

1004
01:30:12,020 --> 01:30:13,669
Home.

1005
01:30:14,523 --> 01:30:16,171
Look.

1006
01:30:27,661 --> 01:30:29,191
(BEEPING)

1007
01:30:33,917 --> 01:30:36,779
I tried explaining to
him as best I could.

1008
01:30:36,879 --> 01:30:41,280
It'll still probably take him a
little time to get used to you.

1009
01:30:41,884 --> 01:30:43,995
He's a good kid.

1010
01:30:44,762 --> 01:30:50,289
I was thinking that maybe we could
all hang until we figure things out.

1011
01:31:06,950 --> 01:31:08,480
Mmm.

1012
01:31:10,746 --> 01:31:11,772
(GROANS)

1013
01:31:11,872 --> 01:31:16,569
Baby, that was no minor surgery.
You need to rest.

1014
01:31:20,923 --> 01:31:22,998
I have an idea.

1015
01:31:29,723 --> 01:31:31,882
You take control.

1016
01:31:41,527 --> 01:31:45,061
- (BUZZING)
<i>- MAN: ...hang tight. We're live in five.</i>

1017
01:31:47,825 --> 01:31:49,520
Ryan?

1018
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:51,809
Ryan?

1018
01:31:52,305 --> 01:32:52,436
