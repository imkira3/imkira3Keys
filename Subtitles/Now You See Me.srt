1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,852
Come in close.

3
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,454
Closer.

4
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:42,332
Because the more you think you see,

5
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:44,854
the easier it'll be to fool you.

6
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,377
Because what is seeing?

7
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,494
You're looking, but what you're really
doing is filtering, interpreting,

8
00:00:52,581 --> 00:00:54,537
searching for meaning.

9
00:00:56,541 --> 00:00:57,769
My job?

10
00:00:57,861 --> 00:01:01,854
To take that most precious of gifts
you give me, your attention,

11
00:01:04,741 --> 00:01:06,811
and use it against you.

12
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:14,176
I'm going to flip through this deck.

13
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:15,740
And I want you to see one card.

14
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:17,260
Not this one. That's too obvious.

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:18,980
Pay close attention.

16
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:22,861
That was too fast.
I'll do it again.

17
00:01:22,942 --> 00:01:24,136
- Are you ready?
- Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:24,222 --> 00:01:25,211
Okay.

19
00:01:27,262 --> 00:01:29,059
- Now did you see one?
- Yes.

20
00:01:29,222 --> 00:01:31,133
- Do you have one in mind?
- Yes.

21
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,060
Now, do you see your card here?

22
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:34,657
No.

23
00:01:34,742 --> 00:01:36,937
That's because you're
looking too closely.

24
00:01:37,022 --> 00:01:39,058
And what have I been
telling you all night?

25
00:01:39,142 --> 00:01:40,621
The closer you look...

26
00:01:40,702 --> 00:01:42,260
The less you see.

27
00:02:05,463 --> 00:02:07,897
Now look into my eyes.

28
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,139
And sleep. Okay.

29
00:02:13,463 --> 00:02:14,657
And...

30
00:02:15,823 --> 00:02:18,417
If you can get this bill from me,
you can have it.

31
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,455
Go ahead. Take it. Get it.

32
00:02:20,664 --> 00:02:23,178
If you can say your name,
you can have it.

33
00:02:26,344 --> 00:02:28,733
All right, just hang out there,
wriggle a sec.

34
00:02:28,824 --> 00:02:31,213
I'm gonna take a little
peek under the hood

35
00:02:31,304 --> 00:02:32,817
- of your hubby's brain.
- Oh, no, no, no.

36
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,059
I'm picturing...

37
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:35,099
Don't tell me. Um...

38
00:02:35,184 --> 00:02:36,253
Of course.

39
00:02:36,344 --> 00:02:38,335
Beach. Cocktails.

40
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:39,943
Florida?

41
00:02:40,064 --> 00:02:41,543
Look, it was a business trip.

42
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,735
I mean, it is a kind of business.

43
00:02:43,824 --> 00:02:46,702
Maybe the oldest business.

44
00:02:46,824 --> 00:02:48,018
You know what, Honey Bee, let's...

45
00:02:48,144 --> 00:02:49,657
She can't move, Mack.

46
00:02:49,744 --> 00:02:51,144
You're thinking of a woman's name.

47
00:02:51,345 --> 00:02:52,698
A, B, C,

48
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:54,013
D, E, F, G,

49
00:02:54,105 --> 00:02:55,220
H, I, J...

50
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,142
J? Jean. Jane. Janet.

51
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:58,454
Who's Janet?

52
00:03:00,065 --> 00:03:01,293
You know Janet?

53
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,653
It's not your best friend, is it?

54
00:03:04,145 --> 00:03:05,658
- Your sister?
- No, please.

55
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:07,975
Her sister? Oh, my God.

56
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:10,096
You weren't away on business.

57
00:03:10,345 --> 00:03:12,063
- You were away on Janet.
- No.

58
00:03:12,185 --> 00:03:13,334
Your wife's sister!

59
00:03:14,105 --> 00:03:15,618
Okay, we need to move over here,

60
00:03:15,705 --> 00:03:18,503
because it seems like she's
a little bit upset right now.

61
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:20,263
You want this to go away?

62
00:03:21,026 --> 00:03:22,664
- Yes.
- Okay, pull out your wallet.

63
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,545
Come on, get it out.

64
00:03:24,786 --> 00:03:26,060
Do you shake down
everybody like this?

65
00:03:26,186 --> 00:03:27,858
No, only the special few.

66
00:03:28,026 --> 00:03:30,096
What is this?
Two hundred seem fair?

67
00:03:30,186 --> 00:03:32,097
You know what?
This is a big deal. Let's go $250.

68
00:03:32,186 --> 00:03:33,175
You're a stick-up artist.

69
00:03:33,306 --> 00:03:34,978
Yeah. Of course.

70
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,061
Okay, and sleep!

71
00:03:38,746 --> 00:03:40,099
Now, when I snap my fingers,

72
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,665
you won't remember any of this.

73
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:42,940
And you, Warren Beatty,

74
00:03:43,186 --> 00:03:46,019
every time you see or
even think of Janet,

75
00:03:46,386 --> 00:03:48,820
you're gonna picture me naked.

76
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:50,021
And that's not a pretty sight.

77
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,136
Yeah.

78
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,377
And... You're wide awake!

79
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,776
Well, we did the best we could,

80
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,217
but some people just
aren't to be hypnotized.

81
00:04:01,307 --> 00:04:03,582
- Oh. I did it wrong?
- Come on, Honey Bee.

82
00:04:03,707 --> 00:04:05,379
- Oh, no, you did it fine.
- Let me buy you dinner.

83
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:06,741
Look after her.

84
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,545
Just have to hit an ATM first.

85
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:26,417
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am the next great magician,

86
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:28,624
and I will give $100

87
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,223
to anyone who can tell me
how this trick is done.

88
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:33,578
I have an ordinary spoon
from Mel's Deli,

89
00:04:33,708 --> 00:04:34,743
right here in Brooklyn.

90
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:36,063
Check it out.

91
00:04:36,468 --> 00:04:40,143
Now, everyone please pay very,
very close attention.

92
00:04:40,388 --> 00:04:42,697
Because I'm about to bend
this spoon with my mind.

93
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:56,144
Thank you. Thank you.
Pass that around.

94
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:57,902
- What's this?
- What are you doing, man?

95
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:00,628
Look at this! Looks like we
got a spoon and a stem.

96
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:02,103
I've got other tricks.

97
00:05:02,309 --> 00:05:04,618
Or you could give me my 100 bucks.

98
00:05:04,829 --> 00:05:05,898
You said you would.

99
00:05:05,989 --> 00:05:07,263
Nice wallet.

100
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:08,498
You have a very good eye, sir.

101
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:09,618
Thanks.

102
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:17,778
Wallet.

103
00:05:18,309 --> 00:05:20,459
My wallet.
My watch!

104
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,185
Stop that guy!

105
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,299
Stop that guy in the leather jacket!

106
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,419
He's got my wallet!

107
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,060
Whoo! Okay, Los Angeles,
are we ready to end this thing?

108
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,499
Yeah!

109
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,581
When that timer hits zero,

110
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,019
a tank full of flesh-eating piranhas

111
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,868
will fall from above.

112
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:50,630
A lady has to have handcuffs.
Right, girls?

113
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,670
One, two, three!

114
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,260
Yeah!

115
00:06:24,632 --> 00:06:26,304
Help! Stop it!

116
00:06:26,432 --> 00:06:28,150
She's serious!
She can't get out!

117
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:31,948
Go get some help!

118
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:33,141
Help, dude!

119
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:36,983
Get out of the way!
Move! Move!

120
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:21,671
Come on! This is bullshit!
Whoever thought of this is a sick sadist!

121
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,143
Yes!

122
00:07:29,194 --> 00:07:30,593
I am your biggest fan.

123
00:07:30,834 --> 00:07:32,631
I could tell by the way you're
attacking my face right now.

124
00:07:32,714 --> 00:07:34,067
Close the door.
Bad apartment building.

125
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,473
- Magician, come here.
- Okay.

126
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:36,869
Whoa!

127
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,273
- Wait, wait.
- What? What?

128
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:40,953
How did you do that...

129
00:07:41,034 --> 00:07:42,262
The seven of diamonds
on the side of the tower?

130
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:43,787
- Yes.
- That's a trade secret.

131
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,182
Uh-uh.

132
00:07:46,114 --> 00:07:48,469
I'll give you a hint. It involved,
uh, bribing the tower electrician.

133
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:50,704
- How much?
- Uh, 50 bucks.

134
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:52,865
- But it's so hard.
- Oh, thank you.

135
00:07:52,994 --> 00:07:54,064
Is it always a seven?

136
00:07:54,155 --> 00:07:55,713
I could do that trick
52 different ways.

137
00:07:55,795 --> 00:07:57,672
Can you do 52 different
tricks on me?

138
00:07:58,115 --> 00:07:59,230
I'll see what I can do.

139
00:07:59,515 --> 00:08:01,233
Ooh! Magic man!

140
00:08:01,555 --> 00:08:02,954
Ah! I love your shampoo.

141
00:08:04,995 --> 00:08:06,986
- Whoa! Hold up.
- What?

142
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:09,950
You need to leave.

143
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:11,064
Are you kidding me?

144
00:08:11,235 --> 00:08:13,226
Oh, my God, this is so embarrassing.

145
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:16,512
Is this what you do? Some kind
of sick trick you do to women?

146
00:08:16,755 --> 00:08:18,825
"45 East Evan Street. "

147
00:08:18,995 --> 00:08:20,508
Don't worry about it.
I'll call you.

148
00:08:20,635 --> 00:08:22,034
You don't have my number.

149
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:24,073
I'm magic. I'll find it.
Have a good night.

150
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:25,829
Oh, you are such an asshole.

151
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:39,433
Hey!

152
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:41,593
Henley.

153
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,989
Danny? Hey.

154
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:49,457
- Ah. You got a card, huh? - Mm-hmm.
- No, no, no, it's good for you.

155
00:09:49,847 --> 00:09:51,721
Congratulations. All right,
so here's what I'm gonna do,

156
00:09:52,063 --> 00:09:53,693
I'm gonna go inside.
I'm gonna scope the place out.

157
00:09:54,062 --> 00:09:55,697
You wait out here. I will come back
and get you, okay? Do not come in.

158
00:09:56,136 --> 00:09:58,364
Hey, Danny! I'm not your
assistant anymore. Nice hair.

159
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:00,271
So, um, actually,
what have you been up to?

160
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,429
I think you know exactly
what I've been up to, Danny.

161
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,272
I saw all your anonymous
posting on my website.

162
00:10:05,359 --> 00:10:08,192
You have a website. That's good.
Good for you. Get the word out.

163
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:09,588
- Oh.
- Uh...

164
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,398
Okay.

165
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:15,676
So apparently none of us
was the only one chosen.

166
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:18,353
Let me be the first one
to kick my ego to the curb.

167
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:19,588
Yeah. Excuse me.

168
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:21,510
- Door's locked.
- Is it? I'll check.

169
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,199
You. Now, hold it,
don't tell me. Uh...

170
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,838
Helen? No, no.

171
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,189
Henley.

172
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,714
It's on your coffee cup.

173
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,279
Thanks for keeping me honest.

174
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,359
That wasn't mentalism, by the way.
It was just an observation.

175
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:37,035
Second observation,
you are beautiful.

176
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,276
Thank you.

177
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,028
That's good. That's very nice.
Very well-polished. Nice bit.

178
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,395
J. Daniel Atlas. Nice to meet you.

179
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,312
Very nice. I know who you are
and I just want to say that

180
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,389
I'm not interested in you doing

181
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,549
your mentalism thing on us.

182
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,154
Especially when we don't know who
brought us here or even if it's real.

183
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,232
Shh! Hold on, I'm sensing...
I'm sensing you

184
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,993
are a control freak.

185
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,315
I'm sorry, have we met before?

186
00:10:56,441 --> 00:10:57,874
It doesn't take a mentalist
to figure that out.

187
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,996
You are a control freak.

188
00:10:59,081 --> 00:11:00,275
Well, I take that as a compliment.

189
00:11:01,401 --> 00:11:02,516
Only he would take it
as a compliment.

190
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:04,912
Okay, great. Good.
Another compliment.

191
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:08,198
Okay. So that's why
you're no longer a couple.

192
00:11:08,441 --> 00:11:09,476
A couple? No, no.

193
00:11:09,641 --> 00:11:10,676
We were never a couple.

194
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,513
He used to saw me in half.

195
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:13,796
She was a very good assistant.

196
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:14,910
But I was too fat for Danny.

197
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,674
No. I said that one time
because of the trap door.

198
00:11:17,921 --> 00:11:19,673
- There were specs.
- You built it this size.

199
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,440
No one could fit through there.
No one.

200
00:11:21,641 --> 00:11:22,790
- Rebecca fit through.
- Ah...

201
00:11:23,001 --> 00:11:24,559
Rebecca fit for years.

202
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:26,354
Do you know how hard it is to stay

203
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,273
in those tiny little costumes?

204
00:11:28,482 --> 00:11:30,359
No. I'm the main attraction.

205
00:11:30,602 --> 00:11:32,479
Okay. So he never
made you feel special.

206
00:11:32,642 --> 00:11:36,555
And, trust me, you deserve
to be made to feel special.

207
00:11:36,682 --> 00:11:38,001
That's a really nice story.

208
00:11:38,162 --> 00:11:39,641
Hope you guys enjoy
each other's company.

209
00:11:40,082 --> 00:11:41,231
No way.

210
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,040
J. Daniel Atlas?

211
00:11:44,122 --> 00:11:46,556
Dude, I've seen everything
that you have ever done.

212
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:47,951
You're like...

213
00:11:48,162 --> 00:11:49,390
I idolize you. Seriously.

214
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:50,915
From a true fan.
It's so nice to meet you.

215
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:52,435
I'm Jack, by the way.

216
00:11:52,722 --> 00:11:54,121
Question.
Did you get one of these?

217
00:11:55,162 --> 00:11:55,993
Yeah. Death.

218
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,157
The High Priestess.

219
00:11:58,243 --> 00:11:59,392
I'm the Lover.

220
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,552
Three minutes.

221
00:12:01,603 --> 00:12:02,672
Hermit.

222
00:12:02,883 --> 00:12:05,522
So, what are we...
Are we waiting for someone?

223
00:12:05,723 --> 00:12:07,042
- Why are we just...
- The door's locked.

224
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:09,751
Oh, no, nothing's ever locked.

225
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:12,558
Hmm.

226
00:12:19,443 --> 00:12:21,274
What is this place?

227
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,558
- Ugh!
- Oh!

228
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:27,242
Wow. Thought my
apartment was nasty.

229
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,034
Man, it's freezing in here.

230
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:39,759
What's that?

231
00:12:39,964 --> 00:12:41,158
I don't know.

232
00:12:44,444 --> 00:12:45,433
What's it say?

233
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:48,242
"Now you don't. "

234
00:12:49,044 --> 00:12:52,354
"A rose by any other name... "

235
00:12:57,285 --> 00:12:58,957
Guys, what's happening?

236
00:12:59,605 --> 00:13:00,594
Whoa.

237
00:13:01,205 --> 00:13:02,433
Look at that.

238
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:04,114
Whoa.

239
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:10,560
It's gas!

240
00:13:10,805 --> 00:13:12,875
Relax.
Just dry ice.

241
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:14,674
Cool.

242
00:13:15,645 --> 00:13:16,998
Wait. What do you think
this is all about?

243
00:13:17,205 --> 00:13:18,718
Hang on. Hang on.

244
00:13:23,805 --> 00:13:24,920
I got nothin'.

245
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:26,844
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you for the delay.

246
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:28,923
I'm just trying to create
the space for wisdom.

247
00:13:29,126 --> 00:13:32,163
Okay, so you're like Buddha,
if he wasn't so enlightened.

248
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,599
And you're like Jesus,

249
00:13:33,686 --> 00:13:36,246
if he was arrogant
and all of his miracles were fake.

250
00:13:36,326 --> 00:13:39,557
Okay, lovebirds, get a room.
Danny, be honest. Did you do this?

251
00:13:39,646 --> 00:13:40,761
No. Wait, did you?

252
00:13:40,846 --> 00:13:42,165
I wish.

253
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:44,921
Why didn't anyone ask me if I did it?

254
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,915
Oh, great.

255
00:13:52,526 --> 00:13:54,039
Electricity is out.

256
00:13:55,206 --> 00:13:56,720
Well, let's check.

257
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:02,002
Whoa.

258
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,240
Blueprints.

259
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:17,400
They're incredible.

260
00:14:18,847 --> 00:14:20,246
Who do you think did this?

261
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:22,477
I don't know, but I really
want to meet them.

262
00:14:24,487 --> 00:14:26,079
It's a show.

263
00:14:28,528 --> 00:14:29,677
Wow.

264
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:47,361
Merritt McKinney,

265
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,407
Daniel Atlas,

266
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:52,996
Henley Reeves,

267
00:14:55,008 --> 00:14:56,726
Jack Wilder.

268
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:01,442
Arthur Tressler and the MGM Grand
proudly presents

269
00:15:04,209 --> 00:15:06,279
The Four Horsemen.

270
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:08,963
Thank you.

271
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:11,444
Tonight we would like
to try something

272
00:15:11,529 --> 00:15:13,963
that will, well, set us a bit apart.

273
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,724
For our final trick, we're gonna
do something never before

274
00:15:17,809 --> 00:15:19,800
seen on a Las Vegas stage.

275
00:15:20,809 --> 00:15:23,118
Or any stage for that matter.

276
00:15:23,969 --> 00:15:25,402
Ladies and gentlemen,

277
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,799
tonight

278
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,482
we are going to rob a bank.

279
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:44,560
That's a lot of excitement for a crime.

280
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:49,005
I'm getting excited.
What about you, people?

281
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,645
One, two, three!

282
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:08,647
Sorry, sir. There's absolutely no recording
allowed during the performance.

283
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,289
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure, of course.

284
00:16:10,411 --> 00:16:11,730
Let me just put this away.

285
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:13,165
Actually, I need to take that.

286
00:16:13,371 --> 00:16:15,123
After the show, I can come
and give it back to you.

287
00:16:16,531 --> 00:16:17,520
Okay.

288
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,729
Okay, okay.

289
00:16:22,971 --> 00:16:24,848
Now, please, please, settle down.

290
00:16:25,571 --> 00:16:28,405
Now who here has a bank
they would like us to rob?

291
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:31,643
That's a lot of people with a vendetta.

292
00:16:31,812 --> 00:16:33,530
So we'll choose one at random then.

293
00:16:35,212 --> 00:16:37,646
My associates will make sure
it's random. Right?

294
00:16:38,732 --> 00:16:41,041
- Elvis, help me out, bud.
- Thank you very much.

295
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,686
In Jack's bowl are ping pong
balls with section numbers.

296
00:16:43,892 --> 00:16:45,883
Jack, could you hand me
a section number?

297
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,491
Thank you.
We are looking at Section B.

298
00:16:47,692 --> 00:16:49,444
Where is Section B?

299
00:16:49,532 --> 00:16:51,966
Okay. There. It's gonna be
one of you guys. Get ready.

300
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:53,811
I don't know why everybody's happy.

301
00:16:53,892 --> 00:16:54,927
It's only them.

302
00:16:55,212 --> 00:16:56,565
Merritt, can I get a row, please?

303
00:16:57,732 --> 00:16:58,768
Thank you, Merritt.

304
00:16:58,853 --> 00:17:00,650
We are looking at row number 5.

305
00:17:00,733 --> 00:17:01,722
Where is that?

306
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,766
And Henley, could I please
have a random seat number?

307
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,246
Oh. Lucky number 13.

308
00:17:07,453 --> 00:17:09,091
B-5-13. Where are you?

309
00:17:09,293 --> 00:17:12,922
Sir, please, stand up.
Ah, there you are. Hi.

310
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,321
Could you just confirm for me that this
is, in fact, your seat? B-5-13.

311
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,368
Yes.

312
00:17:19,453 --> 00:17:21,444
Okay. Wonderful.
Now, could you please tell us

313
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:22,926
your name and the
name of your bank?

314
00:17:23,093 --> 00:17:25,288
Well, my name is Etienne Forcier.

315
00:17:25,533 --> 00:17:28,924
And my bank, it's Credit
Republicain de Paris.

316
00:17:29,094 --> 00:17:30,243
French. Okay. Uh...

317
00:17:30,494 --> 00:17:31,927
We were hoping for something
a little more local,

318
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:34,369
a kind of mom-and-pop
credit union with no security.

319
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:36,410
But that's fine.
A promise is a promise.

320
00:17:36,614 --> 00:17:37,763
Could you please come up to the stage

321
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,173
and we'll rob your bank.

322
00:17:39,294 --> 00:17:41,125
And while he does that...

323
00:17:41,454 --> 00:17:44,571
There is someone here tonight
without whom we would just be

324
00:17:44,654 --> 00:17:47,771
four magicians working the circuit,
trying to get...

325
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,367
Well, actually, trying to get here.

326
00:17:49,454 --> 00:17:52,366
You probably know this man,
if not from one of the many, many

327
00:17:52,454 --> 00:17:53,523
companies he puts his name on.

328
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:57,243
He is our friend. He is our benefactor.
Mr. Arthur Tressler.

329
00:17:57,334 --> 00:17:59,291
Please, stand up, Art. Please, stand up.

330
00:17:59,495 --> 00:18:02,293
The only man here with the
Queen's cell phone number.

331
00:18:03,255 --> 00:18:05,246
Actually, please, stay standing, Art.

332
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:08,411
I want to say that when
we came to Mr. Tressler,

333
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:12,204
we promised that, as a unit, we could
become the biggest name in magic.

334
00:18:12,295 --> 00:18:13,853
So we wanted to say,
"Thank you. "

335
00:18:13,935 --> 00:18:15,766
And by the way, Art,
you notice on the sign out front,

336
00:18:15,855 --> 00:18:17,766
we made sure we put
your name on top.

337
00:18:18,135 --> 00:18:22,253
If you turn out to be as good
as you think you are, dear girl,

338
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:24,371
that won't be necessary much longer.

339
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:25,843
We haven't done our closer yet.

340
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,124
Why don't you watch it

341
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,409
and then you can decide for yourself.

342
00:18:28,495 --> 00:18:30,726
Ladies and gentlemen,
Arthur Tressler!

343
00:18:30,816 --> 00:18:32,488
Thank you.
And, of course, once again,

344
00:18:32,576 --> 00:18:34,532
the Cardinal of Clairvoyance,
Merritt McKinney.

345
00:18:35,056 --> 00:18:38,253
Etienne, what Jack
is bringing to the stage now,

346
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:41,965
is what we in the magic world
call a teleportation helmet.

347
00:18:42,176 --> 00:18:46,695
You will need to wear this,
as it will allow you to literally fold

348
00:18:47,185 --> 00:18:50,616
through space and time
to your bank in the...

349
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:51,845
8th?

350
00:18:52,056 --> 00:18:53,967
- 9th arrondissement.
- Yeah.

351
00:18:54,176 --> 00:18:58,135
Now, once you are there, we will be able
to speak with you through this helmet.

352
00:18:58,216 --> 00:18:59,969
- Now if... Ah!
- Ow.

353
00:19:00,177 --> 00:19:01,849
Oh, my God, that's beautiful.

354
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,815
It has the added attraction of being
very stylish.

355
00:19:04,897 --> 00:19:08,367
It's about time the French learned
from America on that subject.

356
00:19:09,697 --> 00:19:10,812
Is that a beautiful piece of headgear?

357
00:19:10,897 --> 00:19:12,535
- Thank you. Thank you...
- It is.

358
00:19:13,577 --> 00:19:16,171
Thank you. Thank you very much.

359
00:19:16,257 --> 00:19:17,451
Mais oui. Mais oui.

360
00:19:17,537 --> 00:19:18,890
But before you go anywhere,

361
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:21,133
could you please, pick a card, any card.

362
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,206
Not that card. Oh!

363
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:25,973
No, that's an old American joke.
You can take that one.

364
00:19:26,057 --> 00:19:27,490
Okay. This one?

365
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:29,693
Show it to your friends in Section B.
But not to us.

366
00:19:31,498 --> 00:19:33,534
Okay, great. Now if you could
just sign your name there.

367
00:19:33,618 --> 00:19:36,007
- Yes.
- In English, if possible.

368
00:19:36,378 --> 00:19:37,777
- That's good.
- Thanks.

369
00:19:38,898 --> 00:19:40,013
Put it in your pocket.

370
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:42,773
And now for one tiny detail.

371
00:20:00,219 --> 00:20:04,770
Now, Etienne, let's step into
this cockamamie contraption.

372
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:06,890
And I'll step off of it. Bonne chance.

373
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:10,177
It's 11:50 p. m. here in Vegas.

374
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:14,935
That's 8:50 a. m. in Paris.
Your bank opens in less than 10 minutes.

375
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,174
One,

376
00:20:16,259 --> 00:20:17,294
two...

377
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,448
Three.

378
00:20:21,739 --> 00:20:22,933
What the fuck?

379
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:24,737
- Wow! Etienne?
- Whoa. Etienne?

380
00:20:24,939 --> 00:20:26,770
It wasn't supposed to happen
like that, was it?

381
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:27,974
Etienne?

382
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,611
I liked that little French guy.

383
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,815
Where did he go?

384
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,338
Wait, there he is.

385
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,656
No, no, no, no,
please, please, please.

386
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,817
This is Daniel Atlas.
Can you hear me?

387
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,089
- Etienne? Are you okay?
- Yes.

388
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,569
Perfect. What do you see in there?

389
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,655
Money.

390
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,129
Is this real?

391
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,815
Yes. Looks like three million or so
Euros' worth.

392
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,773
Okay, now, here's what
we're gonna need you to do.

393
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:09,376
I want you to take the card that
you signed out of your pocket.

394
00:21:09,501 --> 00:21:11,651
And I want you to take the ticket
stub from tonight's show

395
00:21:11,861 --> 00:21:14,011
and I want you to put it right there
in the middle of the money.

396
00:21:18,181 --> 00:21:19,330
Now drop it.

397
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:34,459
Now, on the side of your helmet
you should feel a button.

398
00:21:34,702 --> 00:21:35,851
Don't press it just yet.

399
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:40,658
That button activates an air duct
that connects Paris to Las Vegas.

400
00:21:40,862 --> 00:21:42,181
Okay, good. Now you can press it.

401
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:45,891
All right, now, Etienne, hold on tight.
You might feel a bit of a vacuum.

402
00:22:03,863 --> 00:22:05,501
Whoo!

403
00:22:17,063 --> 00:22:18,382
Oh. Wait a second.

404
00:22:18,623 --> 00:22:20,022
Huh.

405
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,697
Oh, merde.

406
00:23:12,105 --> 00:23:13,936
Thank you, Etienne.
Thank you, everyone!

407
00:23:14,465 --> 00:23:15,580
We are The Four Horsemen.

408
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,060
- And good night!
- Good night!

409
00:23:30,905 --> 00:23:32,100
Hold up here.

410
00:23:32,466 --> 00:23:33,785
Dylan Rhodes.

411
00:23:35,546 --> 00:23:37,537
What? I don't think
I heard you correctly.

412
00:23:37,786 --> 00:23:39,105
Did you say magicians?

413
00:23:39,306 --> 00:23:40,944
Yeah, Dylan, magicians.

414
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:42,375
Where are you now?

415
00:23:42,626 --> 00:23:44,503
I'm at Aria. I'm heading
up there to grab 'em now.

416
00:23:48,826 --> 00:23:50,623
FBI! Hands where I can see them.

417
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,100
Let's go. Get 'em up. Come on.

418
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:53,301
Uno minuto.

419
00:23:53,586 --> 00:23:55,304
Let's go. Get 'em up.

420
00:23:55,506 --> 00:23:56,780
Put the book down.

421
00:23:56,986 --> 00:23:58,624
Okay. You got me.

422
00:23:58,826 --> 00:24:00,259
- Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Oh, my!

423
00:24:00,826 --> 00:24:03,580
Do one of you guys
mind giving us a hand with our bags?

424
00:24:04,147 --> 00:24:05,136
Let's go.

425
00:24:22,987 --> 00:24:24,818
Boss, please tell me this is a joke.

426
00:24:25,027 --> 00:24:27,939
I just got Willy Mears
to finger Paulie Attanasio.

427
00:24:28,147 --> 00:24:31,423
I'm a month, two tops,
away from blowing this whole thing open.

428
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:33,658
- Get Turkelson.
- He's in Atlantic City.

429
00:24:33,828 --> 00:24:36,547
What about Cowan? Look at him.
He's just sitting there on his ass.

430
00:24:36,668 --> 00:24:37,862
Hilarious, Rhodes.

431
00:24:38,348 --> 00:24:39,463
I love you.

432
00:24:39,788 --> 00:24:40,823
Asshole.

433
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:42,461
I don't have time for this magic crap.

434
00:24:42,668 --> 00:24:45,228
This crap just pulled three million
Euro out of a Parisian bank.

435
00:24:45,308 --> 00:24:46,377
- That's how much they got?
- Yeah.

436
00:24:46,548 --> 00:24:48,061
Actually, 3.2.

437
00:24:52,068 --> 00:24:53,421
Who is she?

438
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,697
Who are you?

439
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:57,979
Alma Dray from Interpol.
I'll be working the investigation with you.

440
00:24:58,188 --> 00:24:59,223
You gotta be kidding me.

441
00:24:59,428 --> 00:25:02,147
It's bad enough they got me chasing
down David Copperfield and Friends.

442
00:25:02,348 --> 00:25:05,421
Now I'm being saddled with,
no offense, with Interpol?

443
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:07,739
I look forward to working
with you, too, Agent Rhodes.

444
00:25:07,949 --> 00:25:10,827
I'm sorry. I don't think I'm gonna
need your help on this. Okay?

445
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:13,020
- Where's the French guy?
- I already spoke to him.

446
00:25:13,669 --> 00:25:16,024
Oh, you did? You spoke
to my witness before me?

447
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:19,266
Your witness? I thought
you didn't want the case.

448
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:21,027
Besides, he's useless.

449
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,782
Oh, really? Why is that?

450
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:25,184
Because he believes
their magic was real.

451
00:25:25,389 --> 00:25:28,426
Oh, he believes the magic was real?
You're right, he probably is useless.

452
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:31,541
Is it okay with Interpol
if we talk to him, too?

453
00:25:31,629 --> 00:25:33,222
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

454
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,342
I have never stolen a
thing in my life, okay?

455
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,780
I tried to give the money back,
but they won't take it.

456
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:42,464
Okay, okay, okay,
let's just say you robbed a bank.

457
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,744
I did.

458
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,104
Fine. Fantastic. You did.

459
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,790
But since I'm new to this,
can you explain to me how you went

460
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,259
from Las Vegas to
Paris in three seconds?

461
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,826
With the teleportation helmet.

462
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,503
Okay, what the hell
is going on here?

463
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,268
He was hypnotized
during the show.

464
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,468
I told you, he's useless.

465
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,348
Okay, I'll deal with you when I'm
done with this other bullshit.

466
00:26:04,751 --> 00:26:05,820
Hey!

467
00:26:05,911 --> 00:26:07,708
During the show,
half the audience was hypnotized

468
00:26:07,791 --> 00:26:09,224
to believe they were
in the Philharmonic.

469
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:11,706
I guess that "bullshit"
was the trigger word.

470
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:14,942
Okay. Hey, hey. Écoutez.
Etienne, come on down from there.

471
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,100
You're not in the Philharmonic.

472
00:26:16,391 --> 00:26:18,825
- How do you say "stop" in French?
- Stop.

473
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:20,020
Tell him to stop.

474
00:26:20,231 --> 00:26:24,383
No, I can't. You just have to
let him finish his movement.

475
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:26,343
Okay, I need a time-out.

476
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:27,984
Too many French
people in one room.

477
00:26:28,111 --> 00:26:29,624
- Agent Rhodes!
- Huh?

478
00:26:29,711 --> 00:26:32,271
I'm ordered by my bosses
to provide a report.

479
00:26:32,511 --> 00:26:35,470
And until we have one,
I'm here, like it or not.

480
00:26:35,632 --> 00:26:37,304
So we can work together,

481
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:41,590
or you can continue to follow behind
asking the same exact questions I'm asking.

482
00:26:41,672 --> 00:26:42,821
It's up to you.

483
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:46,547
Hmm.

484
00:26:46,632 --> 00:26:47,826
I'm not finished.

485
00:26:48,112 --> 00:26:51,787
I just flew 12 hours,
after what was already a long day.

486
00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:53,988
And I do not handle jet lag well.

487
00:26:57,432 --> 00:26:59,821
So if you want to see
who can be grumpier,

488
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:02,022
- I promise you, you will lose.
- Hmm.

489
00:27:02,992 --> 00:27:07,225
Mm-hmm. Fine. So which one of these
idiots do you want to talk to first?

490
00:27:07,313 --> 00:27:08,348
Him?

491
00:27:13,993 --> 00:27:15,062
Dylan, for the record,

492
00:27:15,193 --> 00:27:17,343
mentalism has never actually
been proven to be accurate.

493
00:27:17,473 --> 00:27:18,462
Okay.

494
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,351
That is to say, that it's not a science.
It's more for entertainment.

495
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:22,422
All right.

496
00:27:22,513 --> 00:27:25,869
Just don't believe everything
the guy says. That's all.

497
00:27:27,073 --> 00:27:31,669
Please convey my deepest apologies
to your colleague out there.

498
00:27:31,833 --> 00:27:34,222
I'm really sorry about this
whole Tranny Tuesday thing.

499
00:27:34,354 --> 00:27:35,389
I was out of line.

500
00:27:35,594 --> 00:27:36,709
Tranny Tuesday?

501
00:27:36,874 --> 00:27:38,592
Well, it's an arrangement
he and his wife have.

502
00:27:38,674 --> 00:27:40,426
Or might not have, if you believe

503
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:42,869
everything Agent Fuller
is saying to be correct.

504
00:27:43,034 --> 00:27:47,585
But isn't there a proud tradition in
the FBI of men wearing dresses?

505
00:27:48,354 --> 00:27:52,029
No shame, Agent Fuller. No shame.

506
00:27:53,874 --> 00:27:56,627
I'm just having fun.

507
00:27:56,754 --> 00:27:59,063
Was this your card? No.

508
00:27:59,154 --> 00:28:00,473
See, I knew you weren't
a queen of hearts lady,

509
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:01,543
and I respect that.

510
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,511
The trick usually works better
when I'm not strapped in here,

511
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:04,630
but I understand protocol.

512
00:28:04,715 --> 00:28:05,943
Okay, okay.

513
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:08,749
So, if you had nothing to do with it,

514
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:11,269
then how did the playing
card get into the vault?

515
00:28:11,515 --> 00:28:12,504
Oh, yes. That would be...

516
00:28:12,595 --> 00:28:14,108
What do the kids call it these days?

517
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:15,350
Oh, yes, that's right. Magic.

518
00:28:15,435 --> 00:28:17,266
Just answer the question,
okay, smartass.

519
00:28:17,515 --> 00:28:20,552
All right. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

520
00:28:21,115 --> 00:28:23,071
You can keep that.
Don't share it with him.

521
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:26,227
It says here you are a mentalist.

522
00:28:26,435 --> 00:28:29,393
- Hmm.
- What exactly is mentalism?

523
00:28:29,595 --> 00:28:32,553
Tricks, mostly. Um, some science.

524
00:28:32,755 --> 00:28:36,590
Targeted guessing might
be a most apt description.

525
00:28:36,796 --> 00:28:40,027
Along with some intuition
and the occasional...

526
00:28:41,716 --> 00:28:43,388
Voices in my head.

527
00:28:44,596 --> 00:28:46,314
Says here you were fairly
famous at one point.

528
00:28:46,596 --> 00:28:47,585
Mm-hmm.

529
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,593
You can even hypnotize
people over the phone.

530
00:28:49,756 --> 00:28:52,316
Some big tours around
the U.S. for a few years,

531
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,387
- two TV specials.
- Glory days.

532
00:28:54,476 --> 00:28:57,912
Then your brother/manager disappeared
with all your hard-earned money.

533
00:28:58,156 --> 00:28:59,384
Did your research, did you?

534
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:01,274
IRS audit. Back taxes.

535
00:29:01,476 --> 00:29:05,595
You've had a long hard slog back into
the limelight, haven't you, Mr. McKinney?

536
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:10,467
Yes, indeed, it has. And I do appreciate
that trip down Memory Lane.

537
00:29:10,757 --> 00:29:12,713
As far as I understand it,
when the man from Paris

538
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:13,912
put on the magical helmet...

539
00:29:13,997 --> 00:29:14,986
Listen to me.

540
00:29:15,117 --> 00:29:17,585
If you didn't rob that bank,
then you knew about it.

541
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:18,866
Which makes you an accomplice.

542
00:29:18,957 --> 00:29:21,346
So if you wanna walk out of here today,
I'd suggest you start...

543
00:29:21,477 --> 00:29:24,037
Now you listen to me, unless you think
there's a D.A. in the state of Nevada

544
00:29:24,117 --> 00:29:25,470
who'd be willing to make
sense of this to a jury,

545
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:26,786
then we have a show to perform.

546
00:29:26,997 --> 00:29:29,465
And you, Agent Rhodes,
have a drawing board to get back to.

547
00:29:29,597 --> 00:29:30,996
Is this your first date?

548
00:29:32,117 --> 00:29:33,152
What?

549
00:29:33,317 --> 00:29:37,106
No, I mean, obviously, you guys
don't know each other well, if at all.

550
00:29:37,198 --> 00:29:40,713
But, like,
there is a palpable tension in this room.

551
00:29:40,798 --> 00:29:42,470
And before you get involved,

552
00:29:42,678 --> 00:29:46,148
you should consider the fact
that she has a lot of big secrets.

553
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:51,187
And I know the first one is that this
is your first time off the desk. Isn't it?

554
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:53,071
You should have said something to him.

555
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,194
This is a weird way
for you to find out.

556
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:57,269
You are literally begging to
be arrested. You know that?

557
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:59,713
If it means you would actually do it,
then, yeah. But you won't.

558
00:29:59,838 --> 00:30:03,433
Because if you did, it means that you,
and the FBI, and your friends at Interpol,

559
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:06,989
actually believe,
at an institutional level, in magic.

560
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:09,677
The press would have a field day.

561
00:30:09,879 --> 00:30:11,551
And we'd be even more famous
than we already are.

562
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,313
And you guys would look like idiots
even more then you already are.

563
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:16,350
Well, no, not you. But him. Right?

564
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,668
You have,
what we in the business, like to call,

565
00:30:19,759 --> 00:30:21,192
"nothing up your sleeve. "

566
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,348
And you know it.

567
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:28,196
Don't draw him in and then dump him
because abandonment is a big "area" for him.

568
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:29,668
Mommy?

569
00:30:30,519 --> 00:30:31,793
Daddy.

570
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,313
Ah! You have big daddy issues.

571
00:30:33,639 --> 00:30:35,197
- Okay, that's enough.
- I'll tell you what.

572
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,511
Your average therapist is gonna
charge you $200-$300 for this sesh.

573
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,477
Me? I'll take a tenner.

574
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,875
Okay, later,
if you're feeling magnanimous...

575
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,113
I'll still take a tenner.

576
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,876
You wanna know who sat
in that chair before you?

577
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,036
Mob bosses, murderers, and thieves.

578
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:52,548
And you know who put them there?

579
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,552
The guy who's sitting in this chair.

580
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,634
So I warn you,
I can maintain my resolve much longer

581
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,559
than you can maintain
that phony arrogance.

582
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:06,556
And the instant that you even show
the slightest crack in that smug facade,

583
00:31:06,721 --> 00:31:07,915
I'll be there.

584
00:31:08,081 --> 00:31:09,639
I will be all over you like...

585
00:31:09,721 --> 00:31:10,915
Like white on rice?

586
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:12,720
Sorry. That's unfair.

587
00:31:12,921 --> 00:31:15,071
Let me warn you.
I want you to follow.

588
00:31:15,321 --> 00:31:16,674
Because no matter
what you think you might know,

589
00:31:16,761 --> 00:31:19,400
we will always be one step, three steps,
seven steps ahead of you.

590
00:31:19,481 --> 00:31:20,630
And just when you
think you're catching up,

591
00:31:20,721 --> 00:31:22,040
that's when we'll
be right behind you.

592
00:31:22,241 --> 00:31:23,674
And at no time will you be
anywhere other than

593
00:31:23,761 --> 00:31:24,830
exactly where I want you to be.

594
00:31:24,921 --> 00:31:27,993
So come close. Get all over me
because the closer you think you are,

595
00:31:28,081 --> 00:31:29,434
the less you'll actually see.

596
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:31,034
I'm gonna nail you...

597
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:36,760
Something wrong
with that soda, Miss?

598
00:31:45,682 --> 00:31:46,956
Oh! Shit!

599
00:31:47,522 --> 00:31:49,035
First rule of magic.

600
00:31:49,882 --> 00:31:52,112
Always be the smartest
guy in the room.

601
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,000
Boss, what are we doing?
We're letting them go?

602
00:32:17,243 --> 00:32:19,120
They all but admitted
they're gonna do it again.

603
00:32:19,363 --> 00:32:21,240
About a half an hour ago,
you didn't give a damn about them.

604
00:32:21,483 --> 00:32:23,235
- What changed?
- I met them.

605
00:32:23,323 --> 00:32:24,312
Hey. Guys.

606
00:32:24,643 --> 00:32:26,793
Hey, I ran a check on the audience.

607
00:32:27,203 --> 00:32:28,318
Most of it was just filler.

608
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:30,075
People that Tressler
dragged in to pack the room.

609
00:32:30,163 --> 00:32:33,200
But guess who was sitting there in the back,
filming the whole damn thing?

610
00:32:33,323 --> 00:32:34,312
I don't know.

611
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:35,882
Thaddeus Bradley.

612
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,474
Thaddeus Bradley, the guy from
TV with the DVDs and shows?

613
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:41,559
No.

614
00:32:41,684 --> 00:32:43,834
Okay, well, he debunks magicians.

615
00:32:44,084 --> 00:32:45,915
He exposes them.
He shows you how to do their tricks.

616
00:32:46,004 --> 00:32:47,073
Get him on the phone.

617
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:50,042
- I did. You're having lunch
with him in 45. - Good.

618
00:32:50,204 --> 00:32:52,877
Mr. Bradley started as a magician.

619
00:32:52,964 --> 00:32:54,682
- He was actually quite good.
- Really?

620
00:32:55,004 --> 00:32:57,120
- One of the best.
- You don't say.

621
00:32:58,484 --> 00:33:01,362
"The greatest genius is in
seeing through the illusion. "

622
00:33:01,444 --> 00:33:03,833
That's a man who loves his work.

623
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:07,121
You sure I can't interest you
in a glass of wine?

624
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,038
No, no, no. No, thank you, sir.
We're working.

625
00:33:10,485 --> 00:33:11,634
I will take one.

626
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:22,765
That's incredible.
That's amazing.

627
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:25,514
Red dye, palmed.

628
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:28,284
Is that how Jesus did it?
That's incredible.

629
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:29,718
I'm sorry.
Can I just take a minute here?

630
00:33:29,805 --> 00:33:32,080
You were one of the great magicians.
Why did you stop?

631
00:33:32,725 --> 00:33:35,398
Do you know how many people
went to see magic performed live

632
00:33:35,485 --> 00:33:37,043
in the last half decade?

633
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,400
About 1.6 million.

634
00:33:38,486 --> 00:33:41,796
You know how many DVDs I sold
in the same period?

635
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,205
Five million.

636
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:44,321
Right, so it's about the money.

637
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:45,885
Well, the money is only there

638
00:33:46,006 --> 00:33:49,282
because the need to know is
greater than the desire to be fooled.

639
00:33:49,366 --> 00:33:53,644
Like you, I detest those who prey
upon the gullibility of the masses.

640
00:33:53,726 --> 00:33:57,401
With all due respect,
isn't there a cost, though, to this game?

641
00:33:57,966 --> 00:33:59,001
Cost?

642
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:00,360
I don't know. Careers.

643
00:34:00,446 --> 00:34:01,561
Lives.

644
00:34:01,646 --> 00:34:04,877
I assume you're referring
to Lionel Shrike.

645
00:34:05,326 --> 00:34:07,157
I'm sorry, who?

646
00:34:07,246 --> 00:34:08,760
Lionel Shrike.

647
00:34:08,847 --> 00:34:13,125
A middling magician who drowned
in the Hudson River 30 years ago.

648
00:34:13,247 --> 00:34:17,001
On Mr. Bradley's first special,
he revealed all of Shrike's tricks.

649
00:34:17,087 --> 00:34:20,602
The next year,
Shrike tried to stage a comeback.

650
00:34:20,687 --> 00:34:23,997
He was shackled inside a safe,
and dropped into the river.

651
00:34:24,087 --> 00:34:25,236
But he never resurfaced.

652
00:34:25,327 --> 00:34:27,557
You mean he died?

653
00:34:27,647 --> 00:34:29,444
I didn't kill him.

654
00:34:29,527 --> 00:34:33,759
He killed himself trying to do something
he wasn't prepared to handle.

655
00:34:33,847 --> 00:34:36,077
You do realize this is a game?

656
00:34:36,167 --> 00:34:37,964
Believe me, it's not a game.

657
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,197
It is a game.

658
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:41,040
You're the game.
You're being played.

659
00:34:41,128 --> 00:34:44,484
And your pathetic attempts
at fawning to gain my trust...

660
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,360
I mean, come on.

661
00:34:46,448 --> 00:34:47,437
You got me.

662
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:48,802
If you really want to know

663
00:34:48,888 --> 00:34:52,676
how a bank in Paris was robbed
from a stage in Las Vegas,

664
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:54,724
my special comes out next month.

665
00:34:54,808 --> 00:34:55,923
Or I could just bring you in

666
00:34:56,008 --> 00:34:58,476
on obstruction charges
and force you to tell me.

667
00:34:58,568 --> 00:35:00,081
Unless, of course,
what you're trying to say to me is that

668
00:35:00,168 --> 00:35:03,285
you actually don't know how they did it.

669
00:35:05,248 --> 00:35:07,398
Showmanship and theatrics.

670
00:35:07,608 --> 00:35:09,725
When a magician waves
his hand and says,

671
00:35:09,929 --> 00:35:11,647
"This is where the
magic is happening. "

672
00:35:11,729 --> 00:35:14,118
The real trick is happening
somewhere else.

673
00:35:14,609 --> 00:35:17,567
Misdirection. A basic concept of magic.

674
00:35:17,769 --> 00:35:20,078
Not interested in the concepts of magic.

675
00:35:20,249 --> 00:35:21,728
I wanna know how they robbed a bank.

676
00:35:21,929 --> 00:35:24,602
You're an idiot if you think
they robbed a bank.

677
00:35:24,889 --> 00:35:26,117
But don't take my word for it.

678
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:28,281
How about a trip to Paris?

679
00:35:28,769 --> 00:35:31,806
Hermia, the teleportation helmet,
please, darling?

680
00:35:32,409 --> 00:35:33,762
You're joking, right?

681
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:35,760
You wanna know how
they did it or not?

682
00:35:36,929 --> 00:35:38,921
I'm just gonna put
this on your head.

683
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,643
Step right up.

684
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,209
There you go.

685
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,885
Now we just pull this
down all safe and snug.

686
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,603
Make yourself comfortable.
There we go.

687
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:57,322
And when you're ready to go to Paris,
just say the magic word.

688
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:58,479
Blow me?

689
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,482
- That'll suffice.
- Bon voyage.

690
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:13,770
Bonjour.

691
00:36:13,851 --> 00:36:16,968
I personally prefer to
take the stairs to Paris.

692
00:36:17,491 --> 00:36:19,368
Welcome to the City of Light,
Agent Rhodes.

693
00:36:19,491 --> 00:36:21,209
Hardy har har.
What was with the helmet?

694
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:22,960
My fun.

695
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,364
What?

696
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:26,880
- Nothing.
- Oh!

697
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,563
- So they got a vault set.
- Yes.

698
00:36:30,651 --> 00:36:33,484
And it's the exact replica
of the little French guy's bank.

699
00:36:33,571 --> 00:36:36,131
- So he's a plant.
- He was a dupe, not a plant.

700
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:38,566
They chose him.
They knew which seat he was in.

701
00:36:38,651 --> 00:36:40,608
No, no, no, the audience
picked the seat.

702
00:36:42,012 --> 00:36:44,572
Unless, of course,
the audience didn't pick the seat.

703
00:36:44,652 --> 00:36:46,688
They let them think
they picked the seat.

704
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:48,411
We'll choose one at random then.

705
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:50,528
Actually, they were
just palming the ball

706
00:36:50,612 --> 00:36:52,330
with the seat number they wanted.

707
00:36:53,052 --> 00:36:54,883
We are looking at row number 5.

708
00:36:54,972 --> 00:36:56,291
Henley, could I please
have a seat number?

709
00:36:56,692 --> 00:36:57,647
Lucky number 13.

710
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:59,768
Could you just confirm that
this is, in fact, your seat?

711
00:36:59,852 --> 00:37:01,126
He was selected.

712
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:03,081
They programmed his mind

713
00:37:03,172 --> 00:37:05,322
- to make him go to Las Vegas.
- Viva Las Vegas.

714
00:37:06,612 --> 00:37:09,650
And then they kept reinforcing it,
until he did.

715
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:12,047
They trailed him.

716
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:13,282
They studied him.

717
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:15,125
- Nothing was left to chance.
- Oh!

718
00:37:17,413 --> 00:37:18,448
I got his measurements.

719
00:37:18,533 --> 00:37:20,842
He had no idea he
was their target.

720
00:37:21,133 --> 00:37:23,010
And they simply activated
him in Vegas.

721
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:24,521
When I snap my fingers...

722
00:37:24,693 --> 00:37:27,082
And once again, Merritt McKinney.

723
00:37:27,173 --> 00:37:28,367
But how did they know
what bank was his?

724
00:37:28,893 --> 00:37:29,962
- You're kidding.
- Really?

725
00:37:30,053 --> 00:37:32,613
Can you be any more
of a condescending ass?

726
00:37:33,093 --> 00:37:34,162
Yes.

727
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:35,442
Like this.

728
00:37:36,893 --> 00:37:39,931
There's a very rare,
very mysterious way

729
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:43,529
in which a magician divines
an audience member's bank.

730
00:37:44,654 --> 00:37:45,643
You ready?

731
00:37:45,934 --> 00:37:46,923
Yes.

732
00:37:47,854 --> 00:37:49,207
Credit card.

733
00:37:49,614 --> 00:37:52,412
And that's how they got
the signature for the card

734
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:54,565
they left in the vault in Paris.

735
00:37:54,654 --> 00:37:55,643
Very good.

736
00:37:55,894 --> 00:37:57,247
You're being one-upped,
Agent Rhodes.

737
00:37:57,494 --> 00:38:00,406
Okay, but they had to get
the signature card in the vault.

738
00:38:00,774 --> 00:38:02,287
You said they didn't steal the money.

739
00:38:02,374 --> 00:38:05,411
No, I didn't say they didn't steal the
money. I said they didn't rob the bank.

740
00:38:06,574 --> 00:38:10,284
My guess is that they targeted
a shipment of freshly minted money

741
00:38:10,375 --> 00:38:13,845
headed to the Frenchman's bank
on-board an armored truck.

742
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:18,488
Which, of course,
is just as hard to break into.

743
00:38:18,615 --> 00:38:21,254
Unless you're already inside.

744
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,449
And despite what the banks
would have you believe,

745
00:38:43,896 --> 00:38:46,729
the men who drive these trucks
are not exactly mental giants.

746
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:50,014
For our Horsemen...

747
00:38:50,096 --> 00:38:52,326
- Oh!
- ... it was almost too easy.

748
00:38:58,656 --> 00:38:59,805
Hey, boys.

749
00:39:06,176 --> 00:39:09,213
So, how did they make the fake money
disappear from the vault? What is that?

750
00:39:10,176 --> 00:39:11,610
Flash paper.

751
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:16,052
Magicians use it all the time.

752
00:39:21,257 --> 00:39:24,090
Creates no smoke,
leaves no residue.

753
00:39:27,457 --> 00:39:28,731
Oh, merde.

754
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:31,846
Two days ago, no one
heard of these guys,

755
00:39:32,017 --> 00:39:34,406
but tonight's show sold
out in 35 seconds.

756
00:39:34,657 --> 00:39:37,012
I think these guys have cracked
the secret to show business.

757
00:39:37,217 --> 00:39:39,936
Give your audience $3 million.

758
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,406
Puts 'em in a good mood, doesn't it?

759
00:39:41,618 --> 00:39:42,733
Best finale ever.

760
00:39:42,938 --> 00:39:44,257
They're gonna be the
first magicians in history

761
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:45,333
to get laid.

762
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:47,773
Remember, if the oxygen
mask comes down,

763
00:39:48,018 --> 00:39:49,929
- put it on the lawyer first. Remember.
- Oh, yes.

764
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,453
I always do. It's lawyer first,

765
00:39:52,578 --> 00:39:54,455
- then myself and then the children.
- Then yourself.

766
00:39:54,698 --> 00:39:55,926
Yes. Then the children.

767
00:39:56,938 --> 00:39:59,532
Um... Allow me to make plain
what we've both been thinking.

768
00:39:59,738 --> 00:40:00,773
And what's that?

769
00:40:00,938 --> 00:40:03,930
Well, obviously, you have feelings
of affection for Daniel.

770
00:40:04,178 --> 00:40:09,093
Unrequited and misguided,
owing to his lack of emotional availability.

771
00:40:09,218 --> 00:40:11,892
Consequently, you're very tightly...

772
00:40:11,979 --> 00:40:13,617
How should I put it? Um...

773
00:40:14,139 --> 00:40:15,094
Corked.

774
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,214
Oh, I am?

775
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:19,894
Now, recognizing that you have
physical needs not being met,

776
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:22,447
and strictly in the vein
of helping a sister out,

777
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:27,375
I invite you to think of me
as your own personal corkscrew.

778
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:28,728
Wow. Thanks.

779
00:40:28,819 --> 00:40:31,492
Let me mull over that offer
of cheap and meaningless sex.

780
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,735
Cheap and meaningless,
maybe, but, uh,

781
00:40:34,139 --> 00:40:35,492
not time-consuming.

782
00:40:39,259 --> 00:40:41,250
We should be getting there
a few minutes early.

783
00:40:41,339 --> 00:40:42,409
So, sit back, relax.

784
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,890
We should be in the Big Easy soon.
Appreciate you flying with us today.

785
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,449
So, what's in it for Tressler,
besides the money?

786
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:49,649
Ego.

787
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:52,739
Okay, pick your card.

788
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,128
Look at it, put it in the deck,
and tell me.

789
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,978
No, don't tell me.

790
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,818
- Okay.
- Okay.

791
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,339
Thaddeus was there that night.

792
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,855
He knows exactly how they pulled it off.
What about him?

793
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,049
What are you saying?

794
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,293
You think they could
be working together.

795
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,938
I don't know. All I know
is that these guys

796
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:11,899
were a bunch of street magicians
a year ago with no resources.

797
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:16,139
So, how do they go from doing that to
this without some kind of outside help?

798
00:41:16,221 --> 00:41:17,415
Is this your card?

799
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:20,009
No, my card is sitting
over there in that guy's lap.

800
00:41:21,701 --> 00:41:22,690
Nice shuffle.

801
00:41:23,501 --> 00:41:25,776
You know, this is hard.
According to this book,

802
00:41:25,861 --> 00:41:29,854
some of those guys practice one simple
move eight hours a day for years.

803
00:41:29,941 --> 00:41:33,013
Really? Some of those guys
seriously need to get a life.

804
00:41:33,101 --> 00:41:35,331
Is it magicians, in general,
you have a problem with?

805
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:37,696
Or specifically those guys?

806
00:41:38,541 --> 00:41:41,009
I could care less about
magicians in general.

807
00:41:41,221 --> 00:41:44,020
What I hate is people
who exploit other people.

808
00:41:44,102 --> 00:41:45,171
Exploit them how?

809
00:41:45,262 --> 00:41:46,615
- Try again.
- Um...

810
00:41:47,782 --> 00:41:49,738
By taking advantage
of their weaknesses.

811
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:52,575
Their need to believe in something
that's unexplainable

812
00:41:52,662 --> 00:41:55,540
in order to make their
lives more bearable.

813
00:41:55,622 --> 00:41:57,419
I see it as a strength.

814
00:41:57,502 --> 00:41:59,379
My life is happier
when I believe that.

815
00:42:00,462 --> 00:42:01,815
Is this your card?

816
00:42:02,782 --> 00:42:03,771
Yeah.

817
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:06,017
Yeah?

818
00:42:06,142 --> 00:42:07,541
- Yeah.
- Cool.

819
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:13,298
That smile on your face. Is it real?

820
00:42:13,543 --> 00:42:14,612
Maybe.

821
00:42:15,263 --> 00:42:17,652
So let me ask you,
Mr. Detective Man.

822
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:19,176
Do you feel exploited?

823
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:22,460
Or did you have maybe a tiny,
tiny bit of fun?

824
00:42:24,783 --> 00:42:26,011
Guy goes to the doctor.

825
00:42:26,103 --> 00:42:28,298
Doctor says, "Sir, you're gonna
have to stop masturbating. "

826
00:42:28,383 --> 00:42:29,372
He says, "Why?"

827
00:42:29,463 --> 00:42:30,816
He says,
"So I can finish the examination. "

828
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:32,018
Oh, Danny,
can I talk to you about

829
00:42:32,103 --> 00:42:33,695
- my role in the show real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.

830
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:35,375
Hey, guys.

831
00:42:35,503 --> 00:42:36,902
We got a show to prepare for.

832
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:39,178
- Oh.
- Oh! Do we now?

833
00:42:39,463 --> 00:42:40,498
No, no, no, don't do that.

834
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:41,732
You're not doing that
thing to me. No.

835
00:42:41,823 --> 00:42:43,143
What thing?
I'm just looking at you.

836
00:42:43,264 --> 00:42:44,822
No, you're not. I've been
watching you for a year.

837
00:42:44,904 --> 00:42:46,098
I know all of your little tricks.

838
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:47,543
That what they are to you? Tricks?

839
00:42:47,624 --> 00:42:49,342
Yes, it's gimmicks.
It's Barnum statements.

840
00:42:49,424 --> 00:42:51,142
It's reading the eyes.
Body language. I get it.

841
00:42:51,224 --> 00:42:52,862
If it's such an easy thing,
why don't you do Henley?

842
00:42:52,944 --> 00:42:54,696
Yeah, Danny.
Why don't you do me?

843
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:56,934
No, you're too easy.
I'll do Jasmine.

844
00:42:57,024 --> 00:42:58,503
No.

845
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:01,258
- Do me.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah. Do Art.

846
00:43:01,464 --> 00:43:02,499
Okay.

847
00:43:02,584 --> 00:43:03,619
Even better.

848
00:43:03,704 --> 00:43:04,739
- Art.
- Yeah.

849
00:43:04,824 --> 00:43:07,543
But I warn you, I can be difficult to read,
when I want to be.

850
00:43:07,784 --> 00:43:09,695
Just stay with me, okay?

851
00:43:10,624 --> 00:43:12,376
So, Art, you were a tough kid.

852
00:43:12,624 --> 00:43:14,502
You know, kind of a real rapscallion.

853
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:18,498
You had a dog. A real tough dog.
A brutish breed. Like a real...

854
00:43:18,585 --> 00:43:20,655
I want to say, Ben the bulldog.

855
00:43:20,985 --> 00:43:23,419
Actually, I was a prissy little tot.

856
00:43:23,505 --> 00:43:26,577
I had a fluffy white cat called Snuffles.

857
00:43:26,665 --> 00:43:28,018
Wow.

858
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,379
Ah. Sorry.

859
00:43:29,585 --> 00:43:30,574
Wait, let me try one.

860
00:43:30,665 --> 00:43:31,780
- I can do way better than that.
- Let him do it.

861
00:43:31,865 --> 00:43:32,934
Come on, give me one more time.
One more time.

862
00:43:33,065 --> 00:43:34,623
He can do way better than that.

863
00:43:34,705 --> 00:43:35,694
Let's do family.

864
00:43:36,025 --> 00:43:39,017
You had an uncle on
your mother's side.

865
00:43:39,225 --> 00:43:41,739
He had a real, kind of...
A real masculine name.

866
00:43:41,945 --> 00:43:45,621
A real, kind of, salt-of-the-earth...
You know, a real stick-it-to-you...

867
00:43:45,746 --> 00:43:49,898
Like it was some kind of Paul.
Thompson? Was it a Paul...

868
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:51,744
Okay. You know what?
I got nothin'.

869
00:43:51,866 --> 00:43:52,901
- Nearly though.
- Was I?

870
00:43:52,986 --> 00:43:56,899
Yeah. My uncle's name was
Cushman Armitage.

871
00:43:56,986 --> 00:43:59,705
Really? Snuffles and Cushman Armitage?
That was your childhood?

872
00:43:59,786 --> 00:44:02,141
I certainly hope tonight's show
is gonna be better than this.

873
00:44:03,026 --> 00:44:04,744
Don't worry. Just you wait.

874
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:13,418
Hey. Come on, give me some good
news on a hotel room, please.

875
00:44:13,627 --> 00:44:14,662
What, are you kidding me?

876
00:44:14,747 --> 00:44:16,385
No, it's Mardi Gras, Dylan.

877
00:44:16,467 --> 00:44:18,264
There's nothing within
sight of the theater.

878
00:44:18,347 --> 00:44:20,577
Hold on a second. Hold on.
Where is this woman?

879
00:44:22,707 --> 00:44:24,743
Hey, hey! There you are.

880
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:27,461
What, the French girl doing a little
sightseeing while she's in New Orleans?

881
00:44:27,547 --> 00:44:29,777
No. In fact, here, speaking French

882
00:44:29,867 --> 00:44:31,539
- is actually an asset.
- Huh?

883
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:33,180
Do you see that woman up there?

884
00:44:34,187 --> 00:44:35,176
That's Marie Claire.

885
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:37,662
And she has a lovely
apartment for us.

886
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:40,982
You're welcome.

887
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:42,702
Yeah.

888
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:44,381
We got a place.

889
00:44:46,548 --> 00:44:49,745
I want two each inside of here.
The other 30 around here.

890
00:44:49,868 --> 00:44:51,267
Roofs, alleys, balconies.

891
00:44:51,348 --> 00:44:54,420
- Eyes on The Horsemen at all times.
- Yes, sir.

892
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:58,342
Wow, 100 years ago, William Robinson
took the name Chung Ling Soo

893
00:44:58,428 --> 00:45:02,307
and spent his entire life
never speaking English in public.

894
00:45:04,108 --> 00:45:05,939
This other guy, Maximillian...

895
00:45:06,148 --> 00:45:09,140
I am not interested in a history
lesson on magic at this moment.

896
00:45:09,588 --> 00:45:11,943
If you want to keep playing
into their hands, go for it.

897
00:45:12,028 --> 00:45:14,019
I'm just trying to understand
how they think.

898
00:45:14,108 --> 00:45:16,304
You think I'm playing in
their hands, do you?

899
00:45:16,629 --> 00:45:19,268
I don't know how any of that
is gonna go against this.

900
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:20,907
This what? This magic?

901
00:45:22,989 --> 00:45:24,308
Lionel Shrike.

902
00:45:24,549 --> 00:45:27,905
In Central Park,
he has a guy pick a card and sign it.

903
00:45:28,109 --> 00:45:31,101
Then he goes to a tree
that has been there 20 years.

904
00:45:31,349 --> 00:45:32,577
They saw the tree in half.

905
00:45:32,789 --> 00:45:34,905
Inside the tree, encased in glass,

906
00:45:34,989 --> 00:45:36,707
is the card with the signature.

907
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:37,858
How did he do that?

908
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:41,386
I have no idea. But I'm sure
there's a logical explanation.

909
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:43,217
Excusez-moi.

910
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:46,268
You guys got a guy in that lobby yet?

911
00:45:46,350 --> 00:45:47,749
No, but I do have some good news.

912
00:45:47,990 --> 00:45:49,981
Remember how Atlas
is such a control freak,

913
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:51,662
he's got his whole crew
on those tracking bracelets?

914
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:52,979
What tracking bracelets?

915
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,068
He has every member of his crew
wearing a tracking bracelet.

916
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,340
Those bracelets are on
a sub-8 flat-band.

917
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:00,580
- So as long as Atlas is
tracking them... - Next.

918
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:03,464
...our boys can track Atlas from right
here in the mobile command unit.

919
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,347
Okay, call me if you
get any movement.

920
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,818
Copy that.

921
00:46:15,711 --> 00:46:18,100
You are missing the
big picture here, Dylan.

922
00:46:19,431 --> 00:46:23,140
There is a place in Paris,
Pont des Arts.

923
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,019
Sometimes in the mornings
I sit on a bench there.

924
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:31,146
And I watch the people make a wish
and lock it in a lock on the bridge.

925
00:46:31,351 --> 00:46:34,024
Then throw the key into the Seine.

926
00:46:35,871 --> 00:46:40,342
All day they do this.
Mothers, lovers, old men.

927
00:46:40,711 --> 00:46:46,025
Watching the key sink into the water
and their secret is locked away forever.

928
00:46:46,912 --> 00:46:51,190
Real and, at the same time, magical.

929
00:46:57,472 --> 00:46:58,541
So,

930
00:46:59,432 --> 00:47:03,107
do you really think it's possible
there's a fifth Horseman?

931
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:05,826
Yeah.

932
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:14,183
There is a legend
of a secret order

933
00:47:14,272 --> 00:47:16,150
born in ancient Egypt called

934
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:17,708
"The Eye. "

935
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:24,229
It is said they perfected sleight of hand
to steal food from the Pharaohs

936
00:47:24,313 --> 00:47:26,065
and give it to the slaves.

937
00:47:26,513 --> 00:47:27,502
Their purpose?

938
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:31,786
Using magic and illusion
to even the scales of justice.

939
00:47:32,673 --> 00:47:36,985
Are The Horsemen next in a long line
of fools to believe this myth?

940
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:42,148
Wil I they evade the ru les of law
and logic like they did in Las Vegas?

941
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:47,226
Or will the dark mysticism
of this Southern swampland

942
00:47:47,754 --> 00:47:49,233
get the better of them?

943
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,267
Bravo, Mr. Bradley.

944
00:47:57,354 --> 00:48:01,870
Either you have a cease-and-desist,
which you don't, or you should leave.

945
00:48:01,954 --> 00:48:05,742
If I want something to cease or desist,

946
00:48:06,994 --> 00:48:08,143
it does.

947
00:48:08,234 --> 00:48:09,223
Take five.

948
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:11,705
According to your potential backers,

949
00:48:11,794 --> 00:48:15,389
you stand to make 2.5 million tops

950
00:48:15,674 --> 00:48:17,188
from your best special.

951
00:48:17,435 --> 00:48:20,074
I have here a check

952
00:48:21,835 --> 00:48:23,109
for 3.5 million.

953
00:48:23,315 --> 00:48:24,270
To walk away?

954
00:48:24,355 --> 00:48:28,064
To fly away.
My jet is at your disposal.

955
00:48:30,315 --> 00:48:32,988
Let's not kid ourselves, Mr. Tressler.

956
00:48:34,595 --> 00:48:36,665
You're in this to ride them up.

957
00:48:37,195 --> 00:48:39,151
I'm in it to ride them down.

958
00:48:39,475 --> 00:48:42,512
I take it that we do not have a deal.

959
00:48:44,035 --> 00:48:48,348
And therein lies our conflict.

960
00:48:51,796 --> 00:48:53,024
Let me be blunt.

961
00:48:53,476 --> 00:48:57,913
My bank account is much,
much bigger than yours.

962
00:48:58,116 --> 00:49:00,949
And my lawyers are much stronger.

963
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:04,388
And they will manacle you

964
00:49:05,636 --> 00:49:07,308
with so many injunctions.

965
00:49:07,716 --> 00:49:12,710
Until you stand by, hopelessly watching
everything that you own drain away

966
00:49:13,556 --> 00:49:15,945
in front of your greedy little eyes.

967
00:49:16,156 --> 00:49:18,432
This isn't the first time
I've been threatened.

968
00:49:19,917 --> 00:49:21,316
And I'm still here.

969
00:49:21,397 --> 00:49:25,913
It is, however, the first time
you've been threatened by me.

970
00:49:26,717 --> 00:49:31,108
And if you do anything
to sully my investment,

971
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:33,586
the ride down, which you mentioned,

972
00:49:33,677 --> 00:49:38,626
will be sudden, precipitous,
and measurable on the Richter scale.

973
00:49:40,437 --> 00:49:42,348
Oops. You shouldn't have done that.

974
00:49:43,837 --> 00:49:45,395
According to superstition,

975
00:49:45,597 --> 00:49:48,510
one who uses a doll to
enact one's own wrath,

976
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:53,189
is likely to bring that very
wrath unto himself.

977
00:49:54,038 --> 00:49:55,517
Isn't that funny?

978
00:49:56,358 --> 00:49:58,189
And I thought you
didn't believe in magic.

979
00:50:08,238 --> 00:50:09,307
Do me a favor.

980
00:50:09,398 --> 00:50:13,516
Visualize your most adventurous
sexual experience.

981
00:50:13,598 --> 00:50:14,587
Stay out of my head, you perv.

982
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:18,388
Well, no, if I stay out of your head,
I'm never gonna get into your pants.

983
00:50:18,479 --> 00:50:20,515
- Right.
- So let's stick with this exercise.

984
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:22,476
- And it helps...
- Pardon the intrusion.

985
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,119
I just wanted to wish
you good luck tonight.

986
00:50:25,239 --> 00:50:27,799
What, so you can try to expose
us later on your little website?

987
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:29,028
And on demand.

988
00:50:29,159 --> 00:50:30,592
That's not gonna happen.

989
00:50:30,719 --> 00:50:32,152
Oh, no?

990
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,231
Operating on a special plane
because of The Eye?

991
00:50:35,959 --> 00:50:40,714
I heard it's a lovely place.
Lots of starshine and moonbeams.

992
00:50:40,839 --> 00:50:43,273
Make any magician's wish come true.

993
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:44,792
You've come a long way,

994
00:50:44,879 --> 00:50:46,710
much further than anyone
would have expected

995
00:50:46,799 --> 00:50:48,791
of a bunch of wanna-bes
and has-beens.

996
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:53,032
If by "has-been" you're referring to me,
I just wanna say I'm flattered,

997
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:56,556
because I always considered myself
a never-was.

998
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,790
Do you mind if I do a
quick read on you?

999
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:00,549
By all means.

1000
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:06,230
Okay, I'm picturing a little boy.

1001
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:09,232
He wants to be a great
magician someday.

1002
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,151
And though he's good,
he's not quite good enough.

1003
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:15,313
So he ends up at the bottom
of the entertainment food chain,

1004
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,996
feeding off of those who have
the talent that he never did.

1005
00:51:19,081 --> 00:51:21,595
Tell me. Am I getting close?

1006
00:51:24,321 --> 00:51:27,279
Wait. Before you go. I'm working
on something new. Do you have a second?

1007
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:30,794
Okay. Name a card.

1008
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:32,439
- King of hearts.
- Knew it.

1009
00:51:32,521 --> 00:51:33,749
Okay.

1010
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:42,440
It's up your left sleeve.

1011
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:44,040
Is it?

1012
00:51:44,121 --> 00:51:45,873
No. No, I don't see it up there.

1013
00:51:45,961 --> 00:51:49,671
You know, why don't you check your
unnecessary velveteen pocket there?

1014
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:52,511
Yeah.

1015
00:51:55,999 --> 00:51:57,808
Anyway, thank you so
much for coming by,

1016
00:51:58,005 --> 00:52:00,992
but this is kind of a
talent only area, so...

1017
00:52:02,242 --> 00:52:03,277
Break a leg.

1018
00:52:03,362 --> 00:52:05,398
Hey, you break something, too.

1019
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:08,639
Ladies and gentlemen,
the Savoy management welcomes you

1020
00:52:08,762 --> 00:52:13,074
to tonight's special performance,
The Four Horsemen, Act Two.

1021
00:52:13,282 --> 00:52:15,238
Unlike traditional performances,

1022
00:52:15,442 --> 00:52:18,674
The Four Horsemen encourage you to film,
call your friends,

1023
00:52:18,763 --> 00:52:21,721
upload, stream,
and tweet the show freely.

1024
00:52:21,923 --> 00:52:25,359
Thank you. The show
will begin in a few minutes.

1025
00:52:29,323 --> 00:52:30,802
Nice watch.

1026
00:52:31,963 --> 00:52:34,318
It's a family heirloom.

1027
00:52:37,483 --> 00:52:40,156
Oh. By the way,
I know how he did that trick.

1028
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:42,074
- Who?
- Shrike.

1029
00:52:42,203 --> 00:52:44,114
So, when he was 14,

1030
00:52:44,243 --> 00:52:46,518
he saw a hole in a tree in Central Park.

1031
00:52:46,723 --> 00:52:49,921
He had a guy who worked
at the carousel

1032
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:52,843
sign a card for what looked
like a routine little trick.

1033
00:52:52,924 --> 00:52:54,073
And?

1034
00:52:54,244 --> 00:52:58,237
At the guy's retirement,
18 years later,

1035
00:52:58,404 --> 00:53:03,478
Shrike performs, has the guy sign a card,
and presto!

1036
00:53:03,724 --> 00:53:04,918
The card is in the tree.

1037
00:53:05,084 --> 00:53:06,961
It was in the tree for 18 years.

1038
00:53:07,204 --> 00:53:08,683
The card was in the tree.

1039
00:53:08,764 --> 00:53:12,757
The tree grew around the card in 18 years.
I mean, that isn't magic. It's not magic.

1040
00:53:12,924 --> 00:53:15,722
The point is, the trick
was not to look closely.

1041
00:53:15,924 --> 00:53:20,555
It was to look so far
that you see 20 years into the past.

1042
00:53:20,765 --> 00:53:23,598
After Shrike drowned,
they never found the body.

1043
00:53:24,205 --> 00:53:25,957
What are you suggesting?

1044
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,116
Arthur Tressler presents

1045
00:53:31,365 --> 00:53:32,593
Jack Wilder,

1046
00:53:32,885 --> 00:53:33,920
Henley Reeves,

1047
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:35,444
Merritt McKinney,

1048
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:37,203
and Daniel Atlas.

1049
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:39,123
The Four Horsemen.

1050
00:53:44,285 --> 00:53:45,923
Thank you. Before we begin,

1051
00:53:46,005 --> 00:53:48,041
we'd like to single out
two people in particular.

1052
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:50,594
A man and a woman to whom
we'd like to dedicate tonight's performance.

1053
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:52,404
FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes

1054
00:53:52,486 --> 00:53:58,197
and the lovely, if somewhat inexperienced,
Interpol Agent Alma Dray, everyone.

1055
00:53:59,646 --> 00:54:03,400
Yeah, Agent Rhodes
has personally vowed to "nail us. "

1056
00:54:03,486 --> 00:54:08,002
And we encourage him to do so
if he has the brains and the fur.

1057
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:13,963
What is magic?

1058
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,839
Our argument,
nothing but targeted deception.

1059
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:20,165
So I want you to look.

1060
00:54:20,487 --> 00:54:22,557
Look as closely as possible.

1061
00:54:22,967 --> 00:54:26,926
Because the tricks you are about to see
may not seem connected.

1062
00:54:27,007 --> 00:54:28,918
But we assure you, they are.

1063
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:32,685
Is what follows 100 different tricks?

1064
00:54:33,007 --> 00:54:36,682
Or is it one giant illusion?

1065
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:47,518
And now for one of the
oldest tricks in the book.

1066
00:54:47,607 --> 00:54:49,564
Danny, if you wouldn't mind
opening up the box,

1067
00:54:49,648 --> 00:54:51,798
and showing everybody
that it's completely empty.

1068
00:54:52,128 --> 00:54:56,121
Now, we're gonna need
12 courageous volunteers.

1069
00:54:56,328 --> 00:54:58,444
I'm gonna take sweet
little Fluffy here,

1070
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:01,327
and put her inside this mystery box.

1071
00:55:01,928 --> 00:55:04,840
There are two pencils out there.
Hold 'em up high. Let me see 'em.

1072
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:06,281
- Here!
- Yeah!

1073
00:55:06,968 --> 00:55:08,799
And now, you will say
the magic word.

1074
00:55:09,008 --> 00:55:10,123
Abracadabra.

1075
00:55:10,208 --> 00:55:13,280
Yes, and I will wave this magic wand
for no reason. And then...

1076
00:55:13,368 --> 00:55:15,802
Fluffy has magically vanished
before your very eyes.

1077
00:55:17,368 --> 00:55:20,805
If you haven't experienced
mass hypnosis, you're about to.

1078
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:22,084
And sleep.

1079
00:55:22,249 --> 00:55:25,002
Down, down. Sleep, sleep.
Completely sleep.

1080
00:55:25,209 --> 00:55:26,642
Good, good. Sleep, sleep.

1081
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:30,967
And now we are gonna debunk
a few magic myths this evening.

1082
00:55:31,169 --> 00:55:34,081
We all know that Fluffy is,
in fact, alive and well.

1083
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:37,043
And Fluffy has miraculously appeared.

1084
00:55:37,249 --> 00:55:38,602
As has the mirror

1085
00:55:38,849 --> 00:55:41,158
which makes the box only
appear as though it's empty.

1086
00:55:41,369 --> 00:55:43,405
When you hear the word "freeze"

1087
00:55:43,649 --> 00:55:45,207
you are all football players.

1088
00:55:46,369 --> 00:55:48,837
And your job is to tackle,

1089
00:55:49,049 --> 00:55:50,324
dismantle,

1090
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:51,719
crush,

1091
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,239
tear limb from limb,

1092
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:56,402
the quarterback.

1093
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:01,240
Now, we've all heard
of pulling the rabbit out of the hat.

1094
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:04,322
But has anyone heard of
pulling a hat out of a rabbit?

1095
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:11,125
You will know who the quarterback is.

1096
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,726
He will be the one saying that word.

1097
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:15,959
Freeze.

1098
00:56:26,691 --> 00:56:28,602
Three, two, one...

1099
00:56:35,971 --> 00:56:37,848
Put your hands in the middle.
One, two, three...

1100
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:39,250
Kill the quarterback!

1101
00:56:39,531 --> 00:56:41,123
Get on back to your seats.

1102
00:56:41,371 --> 00:56:43,362
I got a feeling I'm gonna
be seeing you soon.

1103
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,365
I guess you have lost some weight.

1104
00:57:33,013 --> 00:57:34,412
At the intermission,

1105
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,848
we asked you to write down
your current bank balance,

1106
00:57:36,933 --> 00:57:38,412
and seal it in an envelope.

1107
00:57:38,493 --> 00:57:40,961
Now it's time to take those envelopes out.
Everyone take 'em out.

1108
00:57:42,773 --> 00:57:47,289
Now, everybody, shout out your name.
All at once. Go.

1109
00:57:49,013 --> 00:57:50,048
Shout 'em out.

1110
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:54,565
Clement? Frannick?

1111
00:57:54,774 --> 00:57:56,685
- Yeah! Up here!
- Oh. Way up there.

1112
00:57:56,894 --> 00:57:58,850
Okay. Dina? Robertson?

1113
00:57:59,054 --> 00:58:00,169
That's me!

1114
00:58:00,534 --> 00:58:02,843
Okay. Names. Names. Let's go.

1115
00:58:04,254 --> 00:58:06,210
Josepha Hickey?

1116
00:58:06,294 --> 00:58:07,329
That's me!

1117
00:58:07,414 --> 00:58:10,326
Josepha, I want you to
focus on your balance,

1118
00:58:10,534 --> 00:58:12,490
and count from one to 10 out loud.

1119
00:58:12,694 --> 00:58:14,366
One, two, three, four, five...

1120
00:58:14,454 --> 00:58:15,682
Stop.

1121
00:58:15,814 --> 00:58:17,042
Is the first digit 5?

1122
00:58:17,654 --> 00:58:18,609
Yes.

1123
00:58:18,694 --> 00:58:20,013
Do it again. This time, faster.

1124
00:58:20,134 --> 00:58:21,534
One, two, three, four, five, six...

1125
00:58:21,615 --> 00:58:22,684
Stop.

1126
00:58:23,415 --> 00:58:24,928
Six. Again.

1127
00:58:25,015 --> 00:58:26,004
One, two...

1128
00:58:26,095 --> 00:58:30,054
Josepha, is your bank
balance $562 as of today?

1129
00:58:30,375 --> 00:58:32,570
Yeah. That's what I got.

1130
00:58:34,295 --> 00:58:35,853
Unfortunately, you're wrong.

1131
00:58:36,055 --> 00:58:37,090
Okay, Dina,

1132
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,010
1,

1133
00:58:40,615 --> 00:58:41,650
4,

1134
00:58:42,375 --> 00:58:43,364
7,

1135
00:58:44,335 --> 00:58:45,768
- 7.
- Yeah.

1136
00:58:45,855 --> 00:58:49,643
You think it is. But in fact,
you, too, are wrong.

1137
00:58:49,855 --> 00:58:50,890
Uh, Clement...

1138
00:58:51,135 --> 00:58:54,094
You do not have $6,500
in your account.

1139
00:58:54,296 --> 00:58:58,084
In fact, everybody stand up.
Everybody.

1140
00:59:00,096 --> 00:59:02,735
Yeah. Put your envelopes
to your forehead.

1141
00:59:04,376 --> 00:59:05,855
Focus on your number.

1142
00:59:08,376 --> 00:59:09,570
Ooh! Oh.

1143
00:59:10,096 --> 00:59:13,168
This is... Oh, dear.
Just as I feared.

1144
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:15,491
Oh, this is strange.

1145
00:59:15,896 --> 00:59:19,047
You know, I hate to say this,
but you're all wrong.

1146
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,087
Every last one of you is dead wrong

1147
00:59:21,176 --> 00:59:23,133
about what you think
is in your account.

1148
00:59:23,417 --> 00:59:25,135
Okay, you can sit down now.

1149
00:59:25,537 --> 00:59:27,687
Oh! Oh, yeah. I almost forgot.

1150
00:59:27,777 --> 00:59:30,735
This evening would not be possible

1151
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:34,890
if it weren't for our great benefactor
Arthur Tressler.

1152
00:59:35,857 --> 00:59:37,495
Big applause! Big applause!

1153
00:59:37,697 --> 00:59:40,165
Art, actually, why don't you
come up on stage for the finale?

1154
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:42,049
- Come on down, Art!
- Come on down, Art!

1155
00:59:42,257 --> 00:59:44,054
There he goes. Okay, good.

1156
00:59:44,257 --> 00:59:45,292
Are we on red?

1157
00:59:45,377 --> 00:59:47,288
Bright red. We're all standing by.

1158
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:48,976
All right, no one leaves
the theater. No one.

1159
00:59:49,057 --> 00:59:50,092
There he goes.

1160
00:59:50,857 --> 00:59:52,928
Now, Art, did you fill
out your envelope?

1161
00:59:53,138 --> 00:59:54,969
Well, no need.
We've done it for you.

1162
00:59:55,658 --> 01:00:00,732
Now, Art, I took a guess.
North of 140. Am I right?

1163
01:00:01,858 --> 01:00:04,531
That's 140 million, by the way.

1164
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:09,127
I'm sorry, Merritt.

1165
01:00:09,338 --> 01:00:12,330
How can he be right about his balance
and everyone else be wrong?

1166
01:00:12,418 --> 01:00:15,774
I think possibly because he,
too, is wrong.

1167
01:00:16,178 --> 01:00:18,373
Everybody, take out your paper.

1168
01:00:18,458 --> 01:00:23,010
And using the flashlight under your seat,
start to warm up that paper.

1169
01:00:23,179 --> 01:00:26,330
I think your correct
balance begins to appear.

1170
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:33,290
Now, Art, don't worry,
we have a flashlight for you.

1171
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:34,534
Yes.

1172
01:00:38,059 --> 01:00:39,128
Whoa!

1173
01:00:41,299 --> 01:00:43,210
- Look.
- Huh? Wow.

1174
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:44,733
What's going on there, Daniel?

1175
01:00:44,939 --> 01:00:50,377
Wait. This is weird.
A second ago, it said $144,579,651.

1176
01:00:50,459 --> 01:00:51,448
But now...

1177
01:00:52,059 --> 01:00:55,052
Now it says $70,000 less.

1178
01:00:58,460 --> 01:01:00,769
- Josepha, can you stand up?
- Yes.

1179
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,498
Now, what is your new number?

1180
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:07,532
$70,562 now in my account.

1181
01:01:10,860 --> 01:01:14,250
Is it possible that Josepha's
balance went up

1182
01:01:14,576 --> 01:01:16,686
the exact amount that
Art's went down?

1183
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:19,208
Hey. Check it out.
It's happening again.

1184
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:20,415
Is it?

1185
01:01:21,740 --> 01:01:24,050
Wow. It is.

1186
01:01:24,421 --> 01:01:27,572
Art's balance has gone
down another 280K.

1187
01:01:27,741 --> 01:01:29,777
Dina Robertson?
What did yours say?

1188
01:01:30,021 --> 01:01:33,775
$281,477.

1189
01:01:37,741 --> 01:01:39,413
We have a confession to make.

1190
01:01:39,621 --> 01:01:41,612
She's right.
We lied about something.

1191
01:01:41,701 --> 01:01:43,373
Yes. None of you were
chosen at random.

1192
01:01:43,501 --> 01:01:45,935
All of you have one thing in common.

1193
01:01:46,461 --> 01:01:48,372
Everyone in this room was a victim

1194
01:01:48,461 --> 01:01:51,259
of the hard times that hit one of
America's most treasured cities.

1195
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:53,936
Some of you lost your
houses, your cars.

1196
01:01:54,422 --> 01:01:56,458
- Your businesses.
- Your loved ones.

1197
01:01:56,582 --> 01:01:59,779
But all of you were insured
by the same company.

1198
01:01:59,942 --> 01:02:01,580
Tressler Insurance.

1199
01:02:03,102 --> 01:02:04,091
You were abandoned.

1200
01:02:04,182 --> 01:02:05,251
You were loopholed...

1201
01:02:05,342 --> 01:02:06,570
...out of your settlements.

1202
01:02:07,942 --> 01:02:10,581
This is all for show. Correct?

1203
01:02:10,782 --> 01:02:12,010
"All" meaning we're doing it onstage

1204
01:02:12,102 --> 01:02:13,330
in front of a paying audience?

1205
01:02:13,502 --> 01:02:15,094
- Then, yes, it's for show.
- Whoa! Whoa!

1206
01:02:15,422 --> 01:02:17,890
I've got $82,000 in
my bank account!

1207
01:02:18,062 --> 01:02:19,893
It says it right here on my cell phone!

1208
01:02:20,182 --> 01:02:23,140
Everybody, look at your cell phones
right now! Everybody!

1209
01:02:29,703 --> 01:02:30,818
Whoo!

1210
01:02:31,103 --> 01:02:32,092
Is this for real?

1211
01:02:32,303 --> 01:02:33,452
I don't know.

1212
01:02:33,783 --> 01:02:34,852
Is this happening?

1213
01:02:35,023 --> 01:02:36,581
I don't know! I can't tell!

1214
01:02:37,343 --> 01:02:39,459
Hey! Did you do this?

1215
01:02:40,703 --> 01:02:41,931
How could we, Art?

1216
01:02:42,143 --> 01:02:43,292
We don't have your password.

1217
01:02:43,463 --> 01:02:46,773
We'd need access to information
we could never get our hands on.

1218
01:02:47,582 --> 01:02:49,590
Ah, yes, security questions,
for instance, like,

1219
01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:52,767
I don't know, your mother's maiden
name or the name of your first pet.

1220
01:02:53,093 --> 01:02:54,301
Where would we get
that information, Art?

1221
01:02:54,664 --> 01:02:56,302
You certainly would never tell us.

1222
01:02:59,064 --> 01:03:01,294
We got confirmation.
It's really happening. They robbed him.

1223
01:03:03,504 --> 01:03:04,937
Do not let them get away.

1224
01:03:05,064 --> 01:03:07,055
Hey, we left you the
jet and the Rolls.

1225
01:03:14,024 --> 01:03:15,343
You got hell to pay!

1226
01:03:18,344 --> 01:03:19,333
Stop!

1227
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:21,861
Stop! Nobody move!

1228
01:03:23,824 --> 01:03:24,894
Freeze!

1229
01:03:25,145 --> 01:03:26,703
Quarterback!

1230
01:03:29,585 --> 01:03:31,974
We are The Four Horsemen.

1231
01:03:32,065 --> 01:03:33,100
Good night.

1232
01:03:45,385 --> 01:03:46,738
Get 'em off me!

1233
01:03:47,505 --> 01:03:49,097
Get off! Get off me!

1234
01:03:59,466 --> 01:04:00,899
Get off me!

1235
01:04:09,186 --> 01:04:11,336
All right. I want everyone
on the street! Everyone!

1236
01:04:18,306 --> 01:04:20,103
Quarterback!

1237
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:24,419
Fuller, meet me in front of the
theatermand bring the tracker.

1238
01:04:24,947 --> 01:04:27,256
Let's go! Let's go! Now!
Come on! Let's go!

1239
01:04:27,427 --> 01:04:28,496
Give me the tracker.

1240
01:04:28,987 --> 01:04:29,976
Let's go.

1241
01:04:34,187 --> 01:04:35,302
FBI! Clear!

1242
01:04:36,027 --> 01:04:37,016
- Dylan!
- Damn.

1243
01:04:37,307 --> 01:04:38,262
What have you got?

1244
01:04:38,347 --> 01:04:39,939
That's him right there.
Follow the red dot.

1245
01:04:40,027 --> 01:04:43,064
All right, I'll take this.
Go. Box 'em. Cut 'em off that way.

1246
01:04:44,987 --> 01:04:46,466
He's turning left on Burgundy.

1247
01:05:10,148 --> 01:05:11,661
Oh!

1248
01:05:23,548 --> 01:05:24,867
Hey! Move!

1249
01:05:25,188 --> 01:05:26,508
- Move! Move!
- Oh!

1250
01:05:29,149 --> 01:05:30,707
I got him heading north on Bourbon.

1251
01:05:31,069 --> 01:05:32,787
- Sorry. Move, move!
- Hey!

1252
01:05:32,869 --> 01:05:34,666
Hey, excuse me.
Move, move! Excuse me.

1253
01:05:36,389 --> 01:05:37,424
Ow!

1254
01:05:46,149 --> 01:05:47,787
I've lost him at Bourbon.

1255
01:05:53,189 --> 01:05:54,542
Damn! Where are you?

1256
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,264
Excuse me.

1257
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:16,182
He's heading south
on Exchange Place.

1258
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:19,785
Stop!

1259
01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:27,985
What are you doing?

1260
01:06:31,591 --> 01:06:33,024
He's going in Napoleon House.

1261
01:06:35,831 --> 01:06:37,787
Move! Move!

1262
01:06:38,271 --> 01:06:39,784
Move out of the way!

1263
01:06:40,471 --> 01:06:41,460
Hey!

1264
01:06:42,311 --> 01:06:43,300
Move!

1265
01:06:45,591 --> 01:06:47,866
He's in the bathroom.
I have him in the bathroom.

1266
01:06:47,991 --> 01:06:50,266
No! No! No!

1267
01:06:52,151 --> 01:06:53,300
Freeze!

1268
01:06:54,151 --> 01:06:55,630
Lower your weapons!

1269
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:59,022
What? I'm tracking myself!

1270
01:06:59,552 --> 01:07:01,508
The Horsemen left egg on
the face of what they call

1271
01:07:01,592 --> 01:07:06,871
the alphabet agencies, calling into question
the efficacy of the FBI's task force

1272
01:07:07,112 --> 01:07:09,626
as well as the man in charge
of the investigation,

1273
01:07:09,712 --> 01:07:13,227
Special Agent Dylan Rhodes,
who was publicly ridiculed,

1274
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:16,190
and even tackled at
tonight's performance.

1275
01:07:16,512 --> 01:07:17,786
Talk about a fumble.

1276
01:07:18,032 --> 01:07:19,829
This is quickly becoming
a national story,

1277
01:07:19,952 --> 01:07:22,705
as The Horsemen have now seemingly
pulled off the impossible

1278
01:07:22,832 --> 01:07:25,107
for the second time in as many days.

1279
01:07:25,512 --> 01:07:28,710
Two nights ago in Vegas, The Horsemen
seemingly robbed a bank in Paris...

1280
01:07:28,873 --> 01:07:30,022
Hey.

1281
01:07:31,313 --> 01:07:33,873
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a drink.

1282
01:07:37,033 --> 01:07:38,352
I came to get you.

1283
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:39,822
I'm worried about you.

1284
01:07:39,913 --> 01:07:41,744
You're worried about me.
Well, I'm worried about you.

1285
01:07:41,833 --> 01:07:44,301
- Atlas. You had him.
- He didn't have a weapon.

1286
01:07:44,393 --> 01:07:45,667
I couldn't shoot him
and you know that.

1287
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:48,586
Yeah, but you... You let him go.

1288
01:07:48,993 --> 01:07:50,221
Didn't you?

1289
01:07:50,993 --> 01:07:53,791
A pretty French girl shows up out of
the blue, acts like she's my partner

1290
01:07:53,873 --> 01:07:55,591
- and then she lets the bad guy go?
- Let go of my arm.

1291
01:07:55,673 --> 01:07:57,346
Who exactly are you anyway?

1292
01:07:59,594 --> 01:08:01,585
I thought you said you
were a desk agent.

1293
01:08:06,434 --> 01:08:07,662
Not bad.

1294
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:10,703
What is this?

1295
01:08:13,754 --> 01:08:15,187
What's the Eye of Horus?

1296
01:08:15,394 --> 01:08:18,511
Oh, certainly nothing
I want to get into tonight.

1297
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,108
You're dismissive enough
about me when you're sober.

1298
01:08:21,434 --> 01:08:23,265
Find your way back yourself.

1299
01:08:27,595 --> 01:08:30,792
Mr. Bradley? Mr. Tressler would
like you to join him for a drink.

1300
01:08:40,195 --> 01:08:41,230
Sir.

1301
01:08:41,435 --> 01:08:42,470
Thank you.

1302
01:08:44,075 --> 01:08:46,270
What is your role with them?

1303
01:08:46,435 --> 01:08:47,424
Role?

1304
01:08:47,635 --> 01:08:49,353
Yes. You seem to know
everything about them.

1305
01:08:49,435 --> 01:08:51,346
What they're gonna do.
Where they're gonna be.

1306
01:08:51,435 --> 01:08:54,666
If it makes you feel any better,
this wasn't about you.

1307
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:58,192
Please tell me why
this was not about me.

1308
01:08:58,756 --> 01:09:01,316
This is a magic trick, Mr. Tressler.

1309
01:09:01,596 --> 01:09:03,905
Played out on a global scale.

1310
01:09:04,276 --> 01:09:08,235
You, sir, are the abracadabra.

1311
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:11,594
The distraction,
while they set up the real trick.

1312
01:09:11,796 --> 01:09:15,948
I was a $140-million distraction?

1313
01:09:16,796 --> 01:09:17,945
Yes.

1314
01:09:18,636 --> 01:09:22,788
And that very ego that got you
involved with them in the first place

1315
01:09:23,276 --> 01:09:24,789
is what keeps you from seeing that.

1316
01:09:24,956 --> 01:09:26,230
- You know...
- "I can destroy you. "

1317
01:09:26,316 --> 01:09:27,989
Yes, I do know.

1318
01:09:28,197 --> 01:09:29,471
Well, you won't.

1319
01:09:30,037 --> 01:09:32,187
And you won't destroy them.

1320
01:09:32,637 --> 01:09:37,427
Whatever this grand trick is,
it was designed a long time ago.

1321
01:09:37,677 --> 01:09:42,193
And I believe that what's about
to follow is really going to amaze.

1322
01:09:43,037 --> 01:09:47,588
So I suggest you sit back
and enjoy your front row seat.

1323
01:09:48,037 --> 01:09:50,710
You paid quite a lot
of good money for it.

1324
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:52,953
Whatever you stand to make...

1325
01:09:55,077 --> 01:09:58,627
I'll double it,
if you expose them now.

1326
01:09:58,838 --> 01:10:00,191
And destroy them.

1327
01:10:00,638 --> 01:10:02,629
I stand to make five million.

1328
01:10:03,358 --> 01:10:04,586
Am I flinching?

1329
01:10:06,718 --> 01:10:08,310
No, you're not.

1330
01:11:29,241 --> 01:11:30,356
Hey.

1331
01:11:31,721 --> 01:11:33,916
I'm sorry for your arm.

1332
01:11:34,001 --> 01:11:35,559
No. I'm sorry.

1333
01:11:35,641 --> 01:11:37,916
I was an asshole. I was drunk.

1334
01:11:39,921 --> 01:11:42,481
I'm at a loss.

1335
01:11:44,401 --> 01:11:49,839
You know, when Merritt said I hardly spent
any time away from the desk, he was right.

1336
01:11:49,921 --> 01:11:53,197
I'm a researcher.
That's what I do best.

1337
01:11:54,321 --> 01:11:58,234
So what's this all about?

1338
01:11:58,921 --> 01:12:01,561
Supposedly, if you buy into it,

1339
01:12:01,642 --> 01:12:04,315
The Eye are the keepers of real magic

1340
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:07,280
and the protectors
of those who practice it.

1341
01:12:07,362 --> 01:12:09,318
"Candidates for initiations

1342
01:12:09,402 --> 01:12:12,519
"must follow a series of commands
with blind obedience. "

1343
01:12:13,562 --> 01:12:16,793
- This isn't real.
- But there are some who think it is.

1344
01:12:17,202 --> 01:12:18,794
May I?

1345
01:12:20,562 --> 01:12:24,635
According to this, they only
take new people twice a century.

1346
01:12:24,962 --> 01:12:28,352
So what? The Horsemen are doing
these shows in order to get into this thing?

1347
01:12:28,442 --> 01:12:29,671
- I don't know.
- I don't know.

1348
01:12:29,763 --> 01:12:34,757
I mean, I guess these guys
could just rob banks to rob banks.

1349
01:12:34,843 --> 01:12:37,152
They don't have to put
on a show for that.

1350
01:12:37,243 --> 01:12:38,756
It's probably just a myth.

1351
01:12:38,843 --> 01:12:42,836
But it doesn't make any sense, and I
don't think logic will solve this for us.

1352
01:12:42,923 --> 01:12:45,517
- You don't say?
- No.

1353
01:12:46,883 --> 01:12:51,513
I believe that some things
are only discovered

1354
01:12:51,603 --> 01:12:55,994
if you take certain leaps.

1355
01:13:03,004 --> 01:13:04,483
Well, I gotta get to...

1356
01:13:04,684 --> 01:13:06,117
Yeah. Yeah.

1357
01:13:06,204 --> 01:13:08,354
- Thanks. Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

1358
01:13:08,444 --> 01:13:10,241
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1359
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:15,073
If The Eye did exist, we'd have to
assume they were watching us, right?

1360
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:17,558
Shit.

1361
01:13:17,644 --> 01:13:20,283
I think someone is watching us,
but it isn't magic.

1362
01:13:20,364 --> 01:13:23,322
Your fears are correct.
This is not and has never been your phone.

1363
01:13:23,404 --> 01:13:28,114
It's a clone in every way, except for this.

1364
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:29,478
A bug.

1365
01:13:29,564 --> 01:13:33,399
Someone has heard every call,
read every text.

1366
01:13:33,565 --> 01:13:34,793
That's how they were able
to stay ahead of us.

1367
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:35,675
God damn it!

1368
01:13:37,205 --> 01:13:38,957
Get me Atlas' interrogation tape.

1369
01:13:39,205 --> 01:13:41,435
Yes, sir. I have it on the hard drive.

1370
01:13:42,565 --> 01:13:43,634
Picture's up.

1371
01:13:44,125 --> 01:13:45,877
Okay, fast forward.

1372
01:13:46,245 --> 01:13:47,724
Go on, go on. Freeze!

1373
01:13:48,485 --> 01:13:50,282
Okay. Frame by frame. Go on.

1374
01:13:51,165 --> 01:13:52,200
Play it through.

1375
01:13:53,325 --> 01:13:55,634
Ah! Stop. Zoom in tighter. Tighter.

1376
01:13:56,085 --> 01:13:57,882
There. That's where
he took my phone.

1377
01:13:59,165 --> 01:14:00,485
Is that thing transmitting?

1378
01:14:00,566 --> 01:14:01,965
Only when you're making a call
or sending a text.

1379
01:14:02,126 --> 01:14:03,081
Plus I removed the bug.

1380
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:04,724
All right. Put it back in
and turn on the phone.

1381
01:14:04,966 --> 01:14:06,763
They don't know that
we know about the bug.

1382
01:14:06,966 --> 01:14:08,957
As of this instant,
we are ahead of them.

1383
01:14:09,046 --> 01:14:11,162
We need to keep it that way.
Understand?

1384
01:14:11,606 --> 01:14:12,880
Find my real phone and track it.

1385
01:14:13,006 --> 01:14:16,043
Already did. As of about 20 minutes ago,
it's in New York City.

1386
01:14:16,566 --> 01:14:17,601
Good.

1387
01:14:18,006 --> 01:14:20,759
I wanna cut 'em off at the knees.
They got power? Cut it.

1388
01:14:21,086 --> 01:14:24,362
They got phones,
electricity, water? Cut it.

1389
01:14:24,566 --> 01:14:27,319
Squeeze 'em out.
I want 'em to feel our presence.

1390
01:14:27,526 --> 01:14:29,005
And get me an airplane!

1391
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,876
The firewall's down.

1392
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:34,400
- Do they know about this?
- They who?

1393
01:14:34,527 --> 01:14:36,438
"They," "them,"
whoever we're working for.

1394
01:14:36,527 --> 01:14:40,122
Who are we working for?
And are we prepared to go to jail for them?

1395
01:14:40,207 --> 01:14:42,437
- Stop being paranoid.
- It really does happen.

1396
01:14:42,527 --> 01:14:44,358
It happened to you.
Doesn't mean it's gonna happen to us.

1397
01:14:44,447 --> 01:14:46,005
Guys, I don't know if
can do this, all right.

1398
01:14:46,087 --> 01:14:47,406
I don't want to go to jail, you know?

1399
01:14:47,487 --> 01:14:49,284
Then don't screw up.
You're always talking about wanting

1400
01:14:49,367 --> 01:14:50,356
to be treated like an adult.

1401
01:14:50,447 --> 01:14:51,800
Now might be a good time
to start acting like one.

1402
01:14:51,887 --> 01:14:54,037
Stick to the plan.
Stay here and burn it all.

1403
01:15:07,168 --> 01:15:08,283
I don't know what I'm doing here.

1404
01:15:08,368 --> 01:15:09,437
I don't know what you would do
anywhere else.

1405
01:15:09,528 --> 01:15:12,326
I'm here for the pot of gold
at the end of the rainbow.

1406
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:14,444
That's it. Then I'm gone.

1407
01:15:14,568 --> 01:15:16,923
You can do whatever you want
when this is over, Merritt.

1408
01:15:17,008 --> 01:15:18,964
But until then, you stick to the plan.

1409
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:21,164
Hey, guys. Uh... They're here.

1410
01:15:23,088 --> 01:15:24,965
- My guys are ready to go.
- Let's do this quickly...

1411
01:15:25,168 --> 01:15:26,396
- Uh. No.
- What?

1412
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:27,921
She doesn't have jurisdiction here.

1413
01:15:28,008 --> 01:15:29,236
She's Interpol.
She's with me.

1414
01:15:29,328 --> 01:15:31,524
- She stays.
- What? What?

1415
01:15:31,809 --> 01:15:32,798
Stay in the car.

1416
01:15:35,089 --> 01:15:36,283
Let's go.

1417
01:15:42,089 --> 01:15:43,124
Okay. Let's do it.

1418
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:48,398
FBI!

1419
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:54,008
Ladies first.

1420
01:15:54,609 --> 01:15:55,883
Don't move!

1421
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:03,287
Tell me.

1422
01:16:03,410 --> 01:16:04,968
Is my money being well-spent?

1423
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:07,527
Exceedingly well.

1424
01:16:09,330 --> 01:16:10,809
Now you tell me,

1425
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:12,929
how do you like your Horsemen?

1426
01:16:13,010 --> 01:16:15,399
Fricasseed or fried?

1427
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:16,525
Shredded.

1428
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:19,329
I'll tell the chef.

1429
01:17:34,893 --> 01:17:35,882
Freeze!

1430
01:17:43,133 --> 01:17:44,248
Dylan!

1431
01:17:45,053 --> 01:17:46,202
Hold on!

1432
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:49,568
Oh, you little...

1433
01:17:54,093 --> 01:17:55,082
Come here!

1434
01:17:56,853 --> 01:17:58,764
Five is clear. Standing by for six.

1435
01:17:59,093 --> 01:18:00,970
- You little shit!
- You little shit!

1436
01:18:01,213 --> 01:18:03,330
- What game are you playing?
- What game are you playing?

1437
01:18:03,854 --> 01:18:05,765
We're all good at six.
Move to seven.

1438
01:18:05,854 --> 01:18:07,890
Copy that. Going to seven.
Go, go, go!

1439
01:18:08,814 --> 01:18:10,486
No, no, no, no, no. Go back!

1440
01:18:11,374 --> 01:18:12,489
Hey!

1441
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:15,482
Come here!

1442
01:18:22,694 --> 01:18:23,888
Ah!

1443
01:18:46,535 --> 01:18:47,650
Come here!

1444
01:18:47,735 --> 01:18:49,453
All right, whoa, hold on, hold on!

1445
01:18:51,375 --> 01:18:53,172
- Really?
- Yup.

1446
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:54,684
Ow!

1447
01:18:57,375 --> 01:18:58,364
Oh, you...

1448
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:00,724
Ow!

1449
01:19:01,775 --> 01:19:03,255
You little...

1450
01:19:19,696 --> 01:19:20,731
Shit!

1451
01:19:39,097 --> 01:19:40,166
Shit!

1452
01:19:41,577 --> 01:19:42,566
Give me that!

1453
01:20:08,818 --> 01:20:10,376
All units, cover the
north exit now!

1454
01:20:10,498 --> 01:20:11,567
Clear on Evan.

1455
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:13,656
Block every possible exit.

1456
01:20:13,778 --> 01:20:14,893
Hey! Get back... Shit.

1457
01:20:16,658 --> 01:20:18,774
- FBI. Sort of. I need your car. Thanks.
- What?

1458
01:20:18,858 --> 01:20:19,847
What?

1459
01:20:22,498 --> 01:20:24,136
Stop! Stop!

1460
01:20:40,259 --> 01:20:41,294
Hey!

1461
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:12,089
Good. Follow him!

1462
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:14,250
Don't ever tell me to
stay in the car. Ever.

1463
01:21:14,340 --> 01:21:15,659
I didn't have tactical command.

1464
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:18,095
If you don't trust me, just tell me.

1465
01:21:18,180 --> 01:21:19,738
Promise me, next time,
you will back me up.

1466
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,930
Could we have this
onversation later, please?

1467
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:23,578
No!

1468
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:25,895
Okay, fine, I promise. Now, go!

1469
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:35,861
- Whoa! Where'd they go?
- Where are they?

1470
01:21:36,101 --> 01:21:37,773
I don't know. She just
took some guy's car.

1471
01:21:37,861 --> 01:21:39,340
- Where are they?
- That way. That way.

1472
01:21:39,421 --> 01:21:40,456
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

1473
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:41,974
Let's go.

1474
01:21:57,381 --> 01:21:58,370
Whoa!

1475
01:22:07,502 --> 01:22:08,537
There he is!

1476
01:22:20,382 --> 01:22:21,371
Move!

1477
01:22:25,742 --> 01:22:26,777
Left!

1478
01:22:29,062 --> 01:22:30,620
We're heading east
on the FDR Drive.

1479
01:22:30,822 --> 01:22:32,733
- This is not east.
- North! North!

1480
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:34,858
- We're heading north on
the FDR Drive. - What?

1481
01:22:34,982 --> 01:22:37,053
We're coming to you
live above the FDR,

1482
01:22:37,143 --> 01:22:40,055
where NYPD and federal agents,
as you now see,

1483
01:22:40,143 --> 01:22:43,453
are engaged in a high-speed pursuit,
following a black sedan.

1484
01:22:48,583 --> 01:22:49,572
Fuller, where are you?

1485
01:22:50,103 --> 01:22:51,775
Right here. T rying to
catch up to you now.

1486
01:22:51,943 --> 01:22:53,979
We're now trying to
get you a better shot.

1487
01:22:56,503 --> 01:22:57,618
Come on!

1488
01:23:04,863 --> 01:23:05,899
Whoa!

1489
01:23:05,984 --> 01:23:06,973
Sorry.

1490
01:23:10,184 --> 01:23:11,173
Whoa!

1491
01:23:13,224 --> 01:23:16,421
It looks like they're turning
onto the 59th Street Bridge.

1492
01:23:18,584 --> 01:23:22,577
As soon as we have them within range,
we will bring you those pictures live.

1493
01:23:27,624 --> 01:23:28,818
Good. Just stay with him.

1494
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:37,413
Go, go, go!

1495
01:23:41,505 --> 01:23:42,984
Behind... You're behind the bus!

1496
01:23:46,585 --> 01:23:47,654
Get over!

1497
01:23:48,425 --> 01:23:49,494
Ha-ha!

1498
01:23:51,225 --> 01:23:52,260
Oh, shit!

1499
01:23:54,705 --> 01:23:55,740
Uh-oh!

1500
01:24:15,826 --> 01:24:16,815
Come here!

1501
01:24:18,106 --> 01:24:19,539
Get back! Get back!

1502
01:24:20,986 --> 01:24:22,305
Dylan, let's go, man!

1503
01:24:22,506 --> 01:24:23,541
Come on, you...

1504
01:24:24,986 --> 01:24:27,056
- Come on, man! Get out!
- He's gonna die in here.

1505
01:24:27,146 --> 01:24:30,502
Leave him! There's nothing you can do!
Let's go! Leave him!

1506
01:24:35,346 --> 01:24:36,700
- The paper!
- Dylan!

1507
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,858
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!

1508
01:25:04,187 --> 01:25:06,223
Today, the unfolding
story of a popular

1509
01:25:06,427 --> 01:25:08,464
and controversial
group of magicians,

1510
01:25:08,548 --> 01:25:10,539
who have been fast capturing
the public's imagination,

1511
01:25:10,628 --> 01:25:13,938
took a dark turn when a police
action that began in Chinatown

1512
01:25:14,028 --> 01:25:17,816
developed into a dramatic, high-speed
chase across the 59th Street Bridge,

1513
01:25:17,908 --> 01:25:20,866
which caused a fatal collision
that took the life of Jack Wilder,

1514
01:25:20,948 --> 01:25:23,257
one of the so-called Four Horsemen.

1515
01:25:24,468 --> 01:25:28,541
The whereabouts of the other three
Horsemen remain unknown at this time.

1516
01:25:33,428 --> 01:25:35,988
Dylan, they just figured out what
the paper was in Jack's car.

1517
01:25:36,108 --> 01:25:37,258
So they know what it is?

1518
01:25:37,469 --> 01:25:39,107
And why the kid died
trying to protect it.

1519
01:25:39,269 --> 01:25:40,827
Evans is on his way
to brief us right now.

1520
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:42,064
Let's go.

1521
01:25:42,669 --> 01:25:43,988
You're gonna wanna
take this first, though.

1522
01:25:44,069 --> 01:25:45,024
What's that?

1523
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:46,827
Your friend Thaddeus Bradley.

1524
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:48,938
Rhodes.

1525
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,861
You do understand the function

1526
01:25:50,949 --> 01:25:53,099
of the magician's assistant,
don't you, Agent Rhodes?

1527
01:25:53,469 --> 01:25:56,108
Yeah, she's there to distract them
while he sets up the trick.

1528
01:25:56,549 --> 01:25:59,541
You'd be right if you
weren't so wrong.

1529
01:25:59,949 --> 01:26:01,667
While you're watching the magician,

1530
01:26:02,349 --> 01:26:04,909
that lovely innocent is actually
pulling the strings.

1531
01:26:05,029 --> 01:26:08,102
Don't you find it peculiar that
Interpol would send you

1532
01:26:08,190 --> 01:26:11,660
a first timer off the desk
to be your assistant?

1533
01:26:12,190 --> 01:26:14,340
Why did she request to
be put on the case?

1534
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,626
- She was assigned to the case.
- Oh.

1535
01:26:17,670 --> 01:26:19,023
Luck of the draw.

1536
01:26:19,470 --> 01:26:22,542
Like choosing a random
card in the deck.

1537
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:26,265
I find it odd, your sudden
act of generosity.

1538
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:27,544
What's in it for you?

1539
01:26:27,710 --> 01:26:29,541
Just trying to even the game.

1540
01:26:29,830 --> 01:26:33,664
I feel like I'm playing with somebody
wearing ankle weights and flippers.

1541
01:26:34,870 --> 01:26:38,659
Keep up, Agent Rhodes. Keep up.

1542
01:26:42,511 --> 01:26:43,546
Hey.

1543
01:26:43,871 --> 01:26:45,099
We got a problem.

1544
01:26:46,271 --> 01:26:47,340
Here's the safe.

1545
01:26:47,431 --> 01:26:50,229
No, no, no. Hey.
What's he doing here?

1546
01:26:50,391 --> 01:26:51,870
Giving us our first solid lead.

1547
01:26:51,951 --> 01:26:55,023
We've been investigating a private
security contractor called Elkhorn

1548
01:26:55,111 --> 01:26:56,783
- for the last five years.
- And?

1549
01:26:56,871 --> 01:26:58,987
They've been hiding close
to a half billion dollars...

1550
01:26:59,071 --> 01:27:01,539
I didn't ask you. I asked him.

1551
01:27:01,951 --> 01:27:04,146
The money's in a vault inside
a warehouse in Queens.

1552
01:27:04,231 --> 01:27:06,745
We think this vault
is your magicians' final target.

1553
01:27:07,111 --> 01:27:08,830
The magician who
died on the bridge...

1554
01:27:08,912 --> 01:27:12,541
You pulled our classified Elkhorn file
right from his crispy little hand.

1555
01:27:12,832 --> 01:27:15,141
And despite their bullshit
Robin Hood razzle-dazzle,

1556
01:27:15,272 --> 01:27:16,990
your magicians are nothing
more than common thieves.

1557
01:27:17,072 --> 01:27:18,266
How did they get the file?

1558
01:27:19,712 --> 01:27:22,704
This is the part you're gonna find
particularly interesting, Agent Rhodes.

1559
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:25,751
They patched to my server
after they accessed

1560
01:27:26,223 --> 01:27:30,107
your mobile command center in New Orleans
with codes they got from your phone.

1561
01:27:31,432 --> 01:27:33,263
You ordered us all out
to chase after them.

1562
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:36,180
The level of incompetence
displayed on this case,

1563
01:27:36,272 --> 01:27:38,264
that's a magic trick in and of itself.

1564
01:27:38,953 --> 01:27:41,228
Abracadabra. I'm taking over.

1565
01:27:42,673 --> 01:27:44,584
Boss, he's taking over?

1566
01:27:45,113 --> 01:27:46,626
Let's go, gentlemen.

1567
01:27:48,433 --> 01:27:49,468
Hey.

1568
01:27:49,593 --> 01:27:51,470
Hey. I want to have a word with you.

1569
01:27:51,553 --> 01:27:52,668
Don't ever talk to me like that again.

1570
01:27:52,753 --> 01:27:55,108
- Why the hell did you take this case?
- What?

1571
01:27:55,193 --> 01:27:57,309
People say I'm "hard to read. "
That's an American expression.

1572
01:27:57,393 --> 01:27:58,621
Do you understand it?

1573
01:27:58,753 --> 01:27:59,788
Yes.

1574
01:27:59,913 --> 01:28:01,904
Good, then let me make myself
perfectly clear to you.

1575
01:28:02,153 --> 01:28:05,907
If I find out that you are anything other
than who you say you are, I swear...

1576
01:28:06,073 --> 01:28:07,745
And we French also
have an expression.

1577
01:28:09,634 --> 01:28:11,226
"Faith can move mountains. "

1578
01:28:11,434 --> 01:28:15,063
If we hope to capture The Horsemen,
then you need to have a little faith in me.

1579
01:28:15,274 --> 01:28:17,265
Because I've done nothing
to deserve otherwise.

1580
01:28:17,434 --> 01:28:20,073
I just got my ass handed to me.

1581
01:28:20,154 --> 01:28:21,712
I am losing this case.

1582
01:28:21,794 --> 01:28:25,104
So faith is a luxury
I don't have any time for right now.

1583
01:28:31,314 --> 01:28:33,544
More than anything in his life,

1584
01:28:33,634 --> 01:28:39,028
Jack wanted to be the most
famous magician who ever lived.

1585
01:28:39,115 --> 01:28:40,514
And I can't say he achieved it,

1586
01:28:40,595 --> 01:28:44,508
but I do hope wherever he is,
it is full of magic.

1587
01:28:46,315 --> 01:28:48,624
But the point is... Sorry.

1588
01:28:48,715 --> 01:28:50,194
The point is...

1589
01:28:50,275 --> 01:28:54,110
The point of why we are here
is to say that we are not...

1590
01:28:54,558 --> 01:28:56,400
We cannot quit now.

1591
01:28:56,555 --> 01:28:59,069
We've started something
bigger than all of us.

1592
01:28:59,155 --> 01:29:00,986
We have to finish it.

1593
01:29:10,076 --> 01:29:11,145
Approaching the warehouse.

1594
01:29:11,316 --> 01:29:13,876
Units 5 and 6 cover the
north and south entrances.

1595
01:29:14,116 --> 01:29:15,390
We are going for the vault.

1596
01:29:20,196 --> 01:29:23,108
Hey. Where's the safe?
Where's the safe?

1597
01:29:27,356 --> 01:29:28,311
What is this?

1598
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:29,670
Where the hell is
the goddamn safe?

1599
01:29:29,836 --> 01:29:31,633
We just moved it while
you were outside.

1600
01:29:31,796 --> 01:29:32,990
- Evans' orders.
- What?

1601
01:29:33,076 --> 01:29:34,111
I never said that.

1602
01:29:34,196 --> 01:29:37,154
Sir, you got a phone call and said
Washington wants the safe moved.

1603
01:29:37,356 --> 01:29:39,393
You never heard that
come out of my mouth, Agent.

1604
01:29:39,889 --> 01:29:42,552
What happened? You tell me what's
going on, because this is bullshit!

1605
01:29:42,637 --> 01:29:44,036
No!

1606
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,396
Jesus Christ.

1607
01:29:51,597 --> 01:29:54,589
Sir? Sir? What are you doing?

1608
01:29:54,677 --> 01:29:56,508
I think it's Beethoven's
Concerto in D-Major.

1609
01:29:56,597 --> 01:29:58,747
- Where's the safe?
- His team is loading the truck.

1610
01:30:03,077 --> 01:30:04,749
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

1611
01:30:06,317 --> 01:30:07,466
- Stop the truck!
- Stop!

1612
01:30:08,477 --> 01:30:09,877
- Stop!
- Hey! Stop that truck!

1613
01:30:19,278 --> 01:30:21,155
What the hell's going on?
We got our orders.

1614
01:30:21,238 --> 01:30:22,717
Now you've got new orders. Open it up.

1615
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,391
Okay. Here's what I want.

1616
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:31,073
At this moment, they think
that safe's leaving this site.

1617
01:30:31,438 --> 01:30:34,589
So we stay with it. We follow
it all the way to... Where's it going?

1618
01:30:34,678 --> 01:30:35,906
5 Pointz. Up the street.

1619
01:30:36,238 --> 01:30:39,116
So we go to 5 Pointz.
Wherever the safe goes, we go.

1620
01:30:39,278 --> 01:30:40,428
It'll lead us right to 'em.

1621
01:30:41,279 --> 01:30:42,507
You two are with me.

1622
01:30:55,279 --> 01:30:56,268
Guys...

1623
01:30:57,359 --> 01:30:59,748
Look. Office just called with this.

1624
01:30:59,839 --> 01:31:01,909
Horsemen posted it to YouTube
20 minutes ago.

1625
01:31:01,999 --> 01:31:05,958
The point of why we're here
is to say that we are not...

1626
01:31:06,039 --> 01:31:07,836
We cannot quit now.

1627
01:31:08,039 --> 01:31:11,999
We've started something bigger
than all of us. We have to finish it.

1628
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:14,913
Remember the name Jack Wilder
when you see us live,

1629
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,797
5 Pointz, Queens, 7:00.

1630
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,440
Their show is in a half an hour.
It's exactly where we're headed.

1631
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:21,909
I don't know, boss.
I don't wanna be the naysayer,

1632
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:23,911
but these guys are kinda tricky.

1633
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:26,639
Rhodes, they're entertainers.

1634
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,390
A stunning turnout here in 5 Pointz

1635
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,756
as the renegade Horsemen taunt
the FBI into a final showdown.

1636
01:31:34,840 --> 01:31:36,751
The Horsemen have invited
us to their final round

1637
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:39,035
of their three-act face-off
with the FBI.

1638
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:42,911
What do they have in store?
We're about to find out.

1639
01:31:54,241 --> 01:31:56,436
All eyes on the truck.
Let's see who approaches.

1640
01:31:56,561 --> 01:31:57,550
Copy that.

1641
01:32:14,122 --> 01:32:15,874
Agents Rhodes, Fuller?

1642
01:32:16,602 --> 01:32:17,591
Go, for us.

1643
01:32:17,722 --> 01:32:20,236
We've got movement.
Someone's walking toward the truck.

1644
01:32:20,442 --> 01:32:21,557
It's a woman.

1645
01:32:25,722 --> 01:32:27,121
- Freeze!
- Oh, shit!

1646
01:32:28,682 --> 01:32:30,195
What the hell's going on?

1647
01:32:31,242 --> 01:32:33,551
Hey! It's the guy from the TV.

1648
01:32:33,682 --> 01:32:34,717
Put your guns down.

1649
01:32:34,962 --> 01:32:37,681
Look who it is. The fifth Horseman.

1650
01:32:37,762 --> 01:32:40,960
Are you kidding?
I'm following them, just like you are.

1651
01:32:41,043 --> 01:32:44,194
I'm not following anybody anymore.
You've been ahead of us this whole time.

1652
01:32:44,283 --> 01:32:45,921
But guess what?
I'm ahead of you now.

1653
01:32:46,243 --> 01:32:47,915
Your ass is mine.

1654
01:32:48,083 --> 01:32:49,755
You guys are still idiots.

1655
01:32:49,843 --> 01:32:52,073
- Yeah?
- This happens to be the former

1656
01:32:52,163 --> 01:32:54,279
rehearsal space for Lionel Shrike.

1657
01:32:54,923 --> 01:32:56,754
It's where I did my first show.

1658
01:32:56,923 --> 01:32:59,756
Now, if you wanna look
like even bigger idiots,

1659
01:32:59,923 --> 01:33:01,242
why not open it?

1660
01:33:01,603 --> 01:33:03,241
And while you're doing it,
Agent Rhodes,

1661
01:33:03,643 --> 01:33:07,318
would you mind reenacting your look
of absolute befuddlement for me?

1662
01:33:07,563 --> 01:33:09,633
It will make a wonderful
cover for my DVD.

1663
01:33:11,124 --> 01:33:12,113
Open the safe.

1664
01:33:12,204 --> 01:33:13,239
- Go ahead.
- Open it.

1665
01:33:17,244 --> 01:33:18,962
What the hell?

1666
01:33:21,524 --> 01:33:22,593
What?

1667
01:33:22,844 --> 01:33:26,280
Give me that. No. No!

1668
01:33:30,964 --> 01:33:31,999
What is this?

1669
01:33:32,324 --> 01:33:33,996
Get back!

1670
01:33:41,565 --> 01:33:43,681
Who doesn't love
a good magic trick?

1671
01:33:44,485 --> 01:33:46,794
They have you chasing
empty safes again.

1672
01:33:48,165 --> 01:33:51,362
Once again, misdirection.

1673
01:33:58,325 --> 01:33:59,838
The show is starting. Move out!

1674
01:34:00,045 --> 01:34:02,513
The question I'd be asking now,
Agent Rhodes is...

1675
01:34:03,005 --> 01:34:05,155
"What happened to the real one?"

1676
01:34:25,806 --> 01:34:27,558
Clear! Clear 'em out!

1677
01:34:27,646 --> 01:34:29,204
Come on. Move 'em out.
Move 'em out of the way.

1678
01:34:30,646 --> 01:34:32,523
FBI! Give me a path!

1679
01:34:33,166 --> 01:34:34,758
Clear out! Clear out!

1680
01:34:35,006 --> 01:34:36,359
What is magic?

1681
01:34:37,206 --> 01:34:38,241
Magic is deception.

1682
01:34:38,366 --> 01:34:41,881
But deception designed to delight,
to entertain, to inspire.

1683
01:34:41,967 --> 01:34:44,401
Look out! Clear! Clear!
Look out!

1684
01:34:44,887 --> 01:34:46,002
It is about belief.

1685
01:34:46,087 --> 01:34:47,076
Faith.

1686
01:34:47,207 --> 01:34:48,162
Trust.

1687
01:34:52,207 --> 01:34:53,560
Without those qualities,

1688
01:34:53,687 --> 01:34:57,077
magic, as an art form,
would no longer exist.

1689
01:34:57,687 --> 01:35:01,805
But what happens if these qualities
are not used for their higher purpose?

1690
01:35:01,887 --> 01:35:04,560
And instead they're used to cheat, lie.

1691
01:35:04,647 --> 01:35:06,842
For personal gain or for greed.

1692
01:35:07,287 --> 01:35:09,039
Then it's no longer magic.

1693
01:35:09,127 --> 01:35:10,196
It's crime.

1694
01:35:10,407 --> 01:35:13,798
So tonight, for our final act,

1695
01:35:14,242 --> 01:35:17,070
you're gonna help us
set a few things right.

1696
01:35:20,448 --> 01:35:21,642
What's going on here, Rhodes?

1697
01:35:21,888 --> 01:35:23,037
I don't know.

1698
01:35:24,088 --> 01:35:25,282
Showtime.

1699
01:35:30,448 --> 01:35:31,483
Look!

1700
01:35:35,768 --> 01:35:37,679
There they are on the roof
Let's move!

1701
01:35:37,768 --> 01:35:39,087
Go, go, go!

1702
01:35:39,808 --> 01:35:41,082
- Dylan!
- FBI, coming through!

1703
01:35:42,569 --> 01:35:43,524
What are you doing here?

1704
01:35:43,609 --> 01:35:46,169
They're going in the wrong direction
and you know it.

1705
01:35:46,489 --> 01:35:48,684
Rhodes! I need all personnel now!

1706
01:35:48,769 --> 01:35:52,125
You need to trust me.
Take your leap of faith.

1707
01:35:53,089 --> 01:35:54,124
Wait.

1708
01:35:54,569 --> 01:35:55,684
I'm going to go with her.

1709
01:35:55,929 --> 01:35:57,123
Go. I got your back.
I'll be right here.

1710
01:35:58,809 --> 01:35:59,639
Go ahead!

1711
01:35:59,849 --> 01:36:01,282
That's on you, Fuller.

1712
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:20,923
Let's go, let's go! Now, now, now!

1713
01:36:32,130 --> 01:36:33,165
Daniel?

1714
01:36:33,930 --> 01:36:35,124
- Yeah?
- Uh...

1715
01:36:35,250 --> 01:36:39,687
As our, let's call it,
year of living dangerously

1716
01:36:39,810 --> 01:36:43,326
comes to a close,
in a rare moment of vulnerability,

1717
01:36:43,411 --> 01:36:48,121
I'd like to express a sentiment
to you about our relationship.

1718
01:36:48,211 --> 01:36:49,246
Okay.

1719
01:36:49,611 --> 01:36:53,081
Well, when I first met you,
I thought you were kind of a

1720
01:36:54,931 --> 01:36:56,842
- dick.
- Oh.

1721
01:36:56,931 --> 01:36:58,330
And?

1722
01:37:00,331 --> 01:37:01,969
No, that's it.

1723
01:37:02,251 --> 01:37:03,206
That's very nice.

1724
01:37:03,291 --> 01:37:04,690
- Yeah.
- I'm touched.

1725
01:37:04,771 --> 01:37:06,363
Yeah. Just from the heart.

1726
01:37:06,611 --> 01:37:08,124
Well, I didn't tell you
where I was touched.

1727
01:37:08,211 --> 01:37:09,246
Oh, you!

1728
01:37:12,971 --> 01:37:14,610
Oh, God. What are we
gonna do when this is over?

1729
01:37:14,932 --> 01:37:17,730
We're on our own. Our instructions
run out after the show.

1730
01:37:18,612 --> 01:37:22,082
Even if there is no "Eye," if we were
completely played and we spend

1731
01:37:22,172 --> 01:37:26,688
the next 20 years in jail, then,
I just want to say that...

1732
01:37:26,932 --> 01:37:29,287
I know. Me, too.

1733
01:37:29,652 --> 01:37:32,610
Whoa.
Little too sentimental for me.

1734
01:37:39,532 --> 01:37:40,601
There they are!

1735
01:37:43,613 --> 01:37:46,332
Go grab 'em! Put 'em down!
Go, go, go!

1736
01:37:46,493 --> 01:37:47,482
Grab 'em!

1737
01:37:52,493 --> 01:37:53,528
Get up!

1738
01:37:54,013 --> 01:37:55,162
What the hell?

1739
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:00,122
Ah, shit!

1740
01:38:09,333 --> 01:38:10,846
Hello, New York!

1741
01:38:19,054 --> 01:38:20,931
Thank you for the magic.

1742
01:38:21,174 --> 01:38:25,406
And thank you for being such
an incredible and dedicated audience.

1743
01:38:25,814 --> 01:38:29,693
Unfortunately, like all good things,
it must come to an end.

1744
01:38:32,414 --> 01:38:34,564
So we would like to
start our show tonight...

1745
01:38:35,014 --> 01:38:36,527
By saying goodbye.

1746
01:38:37,854 --> 01:38:41,085
All we wanted was to bring
the world to a magic show.

1747
01:38:41,174 --> 01:38:43,688
And thereby bring a little magic
back to the world.

1748
01:38:48,095 --> 01:38:49,210
Clear the way!

1749
01:38:59,015 --> 01:39:02,212
This has been one hell
of a ride for all of us.

1750
01:39:02,735 --> 01:39:05,044
But it's time for us to disappear.

1751
01:39:05,295 --> 01:39:06,614
Good night, New York.

1752
01:39:06,855 --> 01:39:08,254
And thank you for believing in us.

1753
01:39:10,895 --> 01:39:12,044
Stop!

1754
01:39:15,576 --> 01:39:16,565
Freeze!

1755
01:39:17,416 --> 01:39:18,610
No!

1756
01:39:36,256 --> 01:39:37,575
God damn it!

1757
01:40:06,177 --> 01:40:07,371
I'm sorry.

1758
01:40:08,017 --> 01:40:10,133
You were right.
It's bigger than all of us.

1759
01:40:11,137 --> 01:40:15,211
This is one time I'm
not happy being right.

1760
01:40:17,498 --> 01:40:19,250
So I guess this is it.

1761
01:40:21,178 --> 01:40:22,327
Is it?

1762
01:40:48,339 --> 01:40:49,613
Dylan!

1763
01:40:50,059 --> 01:40:52,289
Dylan! Dylan!

1764
01:40:52,579 --> 01:40:53,614
Hey.

1765
01:40:55,059 --> 01:40:56,970
- You see that?
- What?

1766
01:41:00,659 --> 01:41:02,012
Where's the real money?

1767
01:41:18,260 --> 01:41:22,219
You're under arrest!
Hands in the air! Now!

1768
01:42:13,341 --> 01:42:14,456
I've been framed.

1769
01:42:15,821 --> 01:42:18,336
- I'm sure you were.
- Yeah, but I can prove it.

1770
01:42:18,702 --> 01:42:19,976
I always do.

1771
01:42:20,342 --> 01:42:22,298
Just like I predicted that
you'd play the fool.

1772
01:42:22,382 --> 01:42:24,896
Let's just drop the
theatricality, all right?

1773
01:42:25,142 --> 01:42:27,292
The cameras aren't rolling in here.

1774
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:29,976
Fellas, can I have a few minutes
with my friend here alone, please.

1775
01:42:30,062 --> 01:42:31,177
Sure.

1776
01:42:36,902 --> 01:42:37,937
All right.

1777
01:42:38,982 --> 01:42:40,620
- I got information to trade.
- Mmm.

1778
01:42:40,702 --> 01:42:41,817
I believe that's how it's done. Huh?

1779
01:42:41,902 --> 01:42:43,540
If it's of some value.

1780
01:42:46,222 --> 01:42:49,374
These bars give a man
time to think.

1781
01:42:50,543 --> 01:42:53,853
And I'm pretty sure I
know how they did it.

1782
01:42:54,503 --> 01:42:56,573
Remember the rabbit trick
in the second show?

1783
01:42:57,543 --> 01:42:59,374
The box was never empty.

1784
01:43:01,783 --> 01:43:02,932
The room wasn't either.

1785
01:43:04,343 --> 01:43:06,732
After gaining access
to the warehouse,

1786
01:43:06,943 --> 01:43:09,013
The Horsemen left the real safe

1787
01:43:09,103 --> 01:43:14,052
and transformed the whole room
into a giant rabbit box.

1788
01:43:15,703 --> 01:43:20,539
You go charging in there,
thinking the safe was already gone.

1789
01:43:20,744 --> 01:43:21,733
Hey!

1790
01:43:21,824 --> 01:43:23,143
Hey! Stop!

1791
01:43:23,344 --> 01:43:24,572
Missi ng the trick. Again.

1792
01:43:24,664 --> 01:43:27,815
Which was to make you think
the safe had already been stolen,

1793
01:43:27,904 --> 01:43:30,020
so you'd drop your guard and leave.

1794
01:43:30,544 --> 01:43:33,502
Now, while you were busy
playing with balloon animals,

1795
01:43:33,704 --> 01:43:36,298
someone was breaking
into the warehouse.

1796
01:43:54,825 --> 01:43:55,974
Who?

1797
01:43:57,425 --> 01:43:58,904
Jack Wilder.

1798
01:43:59,665 --> 01:44:00,984
Holy shit.

1799
01:44:01,225 --> 01:44:03,580
No. No way. He died right
in front of my eyes.

1800
01:44:04,385 --> 01:44:06,455
U nless, of course, he didn't.

1801
01:44:13,785 --> 01:44:15,104
It's locked.

1802
01:44:15,905 --> 01:44:17,099
Weren't you listening?

1803
01:44:17,586 --> 01:44:18,621
Nothing's ever locked.

1804
01:44:18,826 --> 01:44:19,895
Ah!

1805
01:44:20,066 --> 01:44:22,626
Well done, Mr. Wilder!
Good work.

1806
01:44:22,746 --> 01:44:24,702
You're a big boy now, Jack.

1807
01:44:24,786 --> 01:44:27,141
He escaped in a standard
FBI vehicle, right?

1808
01:44:31,186 --> 01:44:32,539
Led you to the bridge.

1809
01:44:32,786 --> 01:44:36,415
Where the other Horsemen were waiting
with an identical replacement car.

1810
01:44:37,426 --> 01:44:39,496
It only took a split second
for you to lose contact with it

1811
01:44:39,586 --> 01:44:40,575
and make the switch.

1812
01:44:53,827 --> 01:44:55,260
Oh!

1813
01:45:02,907 --> 01:45:05,899
When you crawled
into that burning car,

1814
01:45:06,267 --> 01:45:08,258
quite heroically, I might add,

1815
01:45:10,147 --> 01:45:12,217
you almost died trying to rescue

1816
01:45:12,307 --> 01:45:15,299
what I assume was a cadaver
from the morgue.

1817
01:45:16,827 --> 01:45:20,503
Why go through such an
elaborate and dangerous plan

1818
01:45:21,388 --> 01:45:23,583
- just to frame one guy?
- I don't know.

1819
01:45:23,668 --> 01:45:25,659
They never kept any of
the money they took.

1820
01:45:25,748 --> 01:45:28,137
Yeah, that's the part I haven't
been able to put together yet.

1821
01:45:28,228 --> 01:45:30,788
But I just gave you information that
is substantially more important.

1822
01:45:30,868 --> 01:45:32,745
- No. Not really.
- What?

1823
01:45:32,828 --> 01:45:37,185
I finally got a chance to
really look into Lionel Shrike.

1824
01:45:37,588 --> 01:45:40,421
His comeback attempt. His accident.

1825
01:45:41,388 --> 01:45:44,903
The insurer who denied
the family's claim?

1826
01:45:45,148 --> 01:45:46,342
Tressler Insurance.

1827
01:45:48,269 --> 01:45:50,499
The bank that carried the note?

1828
01:45:51,589 --> 01:45:53,147
Credit Republican of Paris.

1829
01:45:53,229 --> 01:45:54,821
Credit Republicain de Paris.

1830
01:45:56,469 --> 01:45:57,743
What do you make of that?

1831
01:45:57,949 --> 01:45:59,905
A sucker is born every minute.

1832
01:46:01,203 --> 01:46:03,736
What if all this was just
leading up to us

1833
01:46:04,099 --> 01:46:06,595
getting mugged in
Central Park at 2:00 a. m.?

1834
01:46:06,630 --> 01:46:08,379
No, I'm telling you,
we're right where we need to be.

1835
01:46:09,149 --> 01:46:11,379
- We just have to find...
- That?

1836
01:46:13,909 --> 01:46:15,661
The Lionel Shrike tree.

1837
01:46:16,429 --> 01:46:18,421
And the card encased in glass.

1838
01:46:20,470 --> 01:46:21,949
What do we do now?

1839
01:46:38,750 --> 01:46:40,183
Oh, nice!

1840
01:46:56,191 --> 01:46:57,624
So, here's my new theory.

1841
01:46:57,991 --> 01:47:01,427
The legend is that the
"Eye" is everywhere.

1842
01:47:02,111 --> 01:47:03,260
Waiting

1843
01:47:03,631 --> 01:47:07,419
for the truly great magicians
to distinguish themselves

1844
01:47:08,391 --> 01:47:10,143
from the mediocre ones.

1845
01:47:10,911 --> 01:47:12,139
Maybe that was you.

1846
01:47:12,871 --> 01:47:15,101
Deep down inside you
wanted nothing more

1847
01:47:15,191 --> 01:47:17,580
than to be part of the "Eye,"
but you were never invited.

1848
01:47:17,911 --> 01:47:20,984
So you try to destroy them.
But instead what happens?

1849
01:47:21,552 --> 01:47:22,985
You pissed them off.

1850
01:47:24,752 --> 01:47:27,744
The Eye isn't real.

1851
01:47:27,832 --> 01:47:30,904
Okay, then, explain then.
Who's behind all this.

1852
01:47:31,392 --> 01:47:32,950
Somebody with an obsession.

1853
01:47:33,032 --> 01:47:34,226
- Meticulous.
- Who?

1854
01:47:34,312 --> 01:47:37,463
Somebody prepared to
sacrifice everything.

1855
01:47:37,552 --> 01:47:41,750
Somebody so prepared to lose
that they wouldn't even be a suspect

1856
01:47:41,832 --> 01:47:42,901
until the trick was done.

1857
01:47:42,992 --> 01:47:45,665
I don't want a profile. I need a name.
Who? Who?

1858
01:47:45,752 --> 01:47:47,470
I don't know who.

1859
01:47:47,952 --> 01:47:51,423
But they had to have access to
the warehouse to plant the mirrors.

1860
01:47:52,873 --> 01:47:56,786
Always a step ahead of me.
And the FBI.

1861
01:47:56,873 --> 01:48:00,104
Got past them not once,
not twice, but consistently.

1862
01:48:00,553 --> 01:48:02,544
Almost as if they were on the in...

1863
01:48:15,913 --> 01:48:17,141
The inside.

1864
01:48:29,434 --> 01:48:31,823
- You.
- Mmm.

1865
01:48:35,074 --> 01:48:36,223
Why?

1866
01:48:36,914 --> 01:48:39,030
That is the question, isn't it?

1867
01:48:40,074 --> 01:48:41,143
You're right.

1868
01:48:42,234 --> 01:48:46,671
I can't tell you how long I've waited
to see the look on your face.

1869
01:48:49,114 --> 01:48:50,468
Who are you?

1870
01:48:51,715 --> 01:48:53,068
What do you want from me?

1871
01:48:53,955 --> 01:48:55,468
What do I want?

1872
01:48:55,875 --> 01:48:58,787
I want you to spend
the rest of your life in this cell,

1873
01:48:58,875 --> 01:49:02,868
staring at four walls and
wondering how you missed it.

1874
01:49:03,595 --> 01:49:06,667
How you let yourself
be so blinded by your ego

1875
01:49:07,235 --> 01:49:09,624
that you convinced yourself
that you were one step ahead

1876
01:49:09,715 --> 01:49:12,070
when you were always
two steps behind.

1877
01:49:17,115 --> 01:49:18,230
Dylan?

1878
01:49:19,315 --> 01:49:20,305
Wait a minute.

1879
01:49:21,356 --> 01:49:23,267
Dylan! How did this happen?

1880
01:49:31,156 --> 01:49:32,828
Dylan!

1881
01:49:32,996 --> 01:49:33,985
Why?

1882
01:49:34,476 --> 01:49:35,465
Why?

1883
01:49:39,756 --> 01:49:41,826
Oh, my God.

1884
01:49:42,876 --> 01:49:46,073
I did not see that coming.
That's impossible!

1885
01:49:46,156 --> 01:49:47,191
No way.

1886
01:49:47,276 --> 01:49:49,665
That was actually pretty good.

1887
01:49:50,116 --> 01:49:51,152
Thank you.

1888
01:49:51,597 --> 01:49:53,906
When I said, "Always be
the smartest guy in the room. "

1889
01:49:53,997 --> 01:49:54,952
We were in agreement.

1890
01:49:55,037 --> 01:49:56,072
Okay. Right.

1891
01:49:56,757 --> 01:49:57,746
Henley.

1892
01:49:58,477 --> 01:50:00,195
I've never seen her speechless.

1893
01:50:00,317 --> 01:50:02,035
I take that as a huge compliment.

1894
01:50:02,757 --> 01:50:05,396
Hey, man, I'm so sorry
or kicking your ass. Really.

1895
01:50:06,237 --> 01:50:11,470
Hey, listen, for the record,
I have always been a 100% believer.

1896
01:50:11,557 --> 01:50:14,788
And the amount of energy I have
expended to keep these infidels on point...

1897
01:50:16,077 --> 01:50:18,113
Merritt, you're in.

1898
01:50:18,957 --> 01:50:19,992
God bless.

1899
01:50:20,157 --> 01:50:21,193
Come.

1900
01:50:22,238 --> 01:50:27,312
The real magic is taking four strong solo
acts and making them all work together.

1901
01:50:27,398 --> 01:50:29,548
And that's exactly what you did.

1902
01:50:30,998 --> 01:50:32,033
So welcome.

1903
01:50:35,358 --> 01:50:37,428
Welcome to the Eye.

1904
01:51:44,600 --> 01:51:46,113
It was all connected.

1905
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:50,352
Credit Republican.
Tressler Insurance.

1906
01:51:52,521 --> 01:51:53,636
Bonjour.

1907
01:51:55,361 --> 01:51:56,589
Bonjour.

1908
01:51:59,761 --> 01:52:03,071
And Elkhorn? What's the
connection to Shrike?

1909
01:52:05,681 --> 01:52:11,199
Elkhorn started as a safe manufacturer.
They used cheap steel.

1910
01:52:12,801 --> 01:52:13,836
They cut corners.

1911
01:52:14,161 --> 01:52:17,312
When he got to the bottom of the river,
the safe warped.

1912
01:52:17,401 --> 01:52:18,754
And he was trapped.

1913
01:52:20,401 --> 01:52:21,994
He was your father.

1914
01:52:23,922 --> 01:52:27,278
The morning before the show
didn't feel like any other day.

1915
01:52:28,322 --> 01:52:30,777
When my father said
he had to go to work,

1916
01:52:31,162 --> 01:52:33,643
he could see that I didn't
want him to leave.

1917
01:52:35,602 --> 01:52:40,756
So he gave me his watch, and he told me
to count the seconds until he came back.

1918
01:52:41,922 --> 01:52:44,561
I have never let his watch stop since then.

1919
01:52:44,682 --> 01:52:46,798
And from that moment on,

1920
01:52:46,882 --> 01:52:49,442
I created a persona.

1921
01:52:50,082 --> 01:52:51,959
I planned. I worked out every detail.

1922
01:52:52,042 --> 01:52:55,319
But the one thing that I
couldn't imagine happening

1923
01:52:55,803 --> 01:52:56,952
was you.

1924
01:52:58,643 --> 01:53:01,601
And I know that the
logical conclusion for you

1925
01:53:02,083 --> 01:53:04,802
is to take this case
to its resolution.

1926
01:53:04,883 --> 01:53:07,955
And for you to turn me in.

1927
01:53:13,083 --> 01:53:14,152
Yeah.

1928
01:53:16,123 --> 01:53:19,957
But you know how I feel
about resolution and logic.

1929
01:53:21,323 --> 01:53:22,643
And you also know

1930
01:53:23,484 --> 01:53:27,841
that I think some things
are best left unexplained.

1931
01:53:34,324 --> 01:53:36,042
One more secret to lock away.

1932
01:53:40,804 --> 01:53:42,362
Hmm.

1933
01:54:03,605 --> 01:54:04,879
Come in close.

1934
01:54:05,605 --> 01:54:06,799
Closer.

1935
01:54:07,125 --> 01:54:09,081
Because now you know our secret.

1936
01:54:09,325 --> 01:54:11,714
We could be anywhere.
Watching you.

1937
01:54:12,245 --> 01:54:15,123
We're looking for someone
to help us with our next trick.

1938
01:54:15,965 --> 01:54:18,525
On the count of three,
open your eyes

1939
01:54:18,605 --> 01:54:20,197
and tell me what you see.

1940
01:54:21,565 --> 01:54:22,634
One.

1941
01:54:22,765 --> 01:54:23,801
Two...

1942
01:55:55,689 --> 01:55:57,566
Please, stop, stop, stop.

1943
01:55:57,969 --> 01:56:01,644
All right, stop the van. Stop the van.
I'm gonna jump out of the van.

1944
01:56:02,649 --> 01:56:04,162
Oh, thank God.

1945
01:56:06,089 --> 01:56:08,159
Where are we?

1946
01:56:08,249 --> 01:56:10,638
Great, another shit hole.

1947
01:56:10,769 --> 01:56:12,725
Okay, feeling it.

1948
01:56:12,809 --> 01:56:16,961
I'm exhausted, and hungry,
and cranky.

1949
01:56:18,009 --> 01:56:19,840
Check out this place.

1950
01:56:19,929 --> 01:56:21,248
Where'd you bring us?

1951
01:56:21,369 --> 01:56:22,768
Was there no landfill
where we were?

1952
01:56:22,849 --> 01:56:24,681
This place is awesome.

1953
01:56:26,210 --> 01:56:27,928
- Is this our new gear?
- There'd better not be, like,

1954
01:56:28,010 --> 01:56:29,966
matching jumpsuits in there.
You know I don't wear spandex.

1955
01:56:30,050 --> 01:56:31,165
It's locked.

1956
01:56:31,370 --> 01:56:32,439
Guys, the cards.

1957
01:56:32,530 --> 01:56:33,724
What card?

1958
01:56:33,850 --> 01:56:35,044
What do you mean, "what card"?

1959
01:56:37,170 --> 01:56:38,159
Hmm.

1960
01:56:39,210 --> 01:56:40,199
Okay.

1961
01:56:41,305 --> 01:57:41,329
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
