1
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,538
Hey.

2
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,258
I wanna show you something.

3
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,218
What?

4
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:57,893
Have you ever seen
something so scary

5
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,619
that you had to show
to someone else?

6
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,539
Um...

7
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,578
I mean, like, you know,
a movie or something.

8
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:07,298
Well...

9
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,215
I've got the scariest
freakin' movie you'll ever see.

10
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:16,339
Now... A buddy of mine
actually turned me on to it.

11
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,297
And, uh, he made me a copy.

12
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,497
So... I did one for you.

13
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,491
You brought me here
to watch a video?

14
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,175
Well, two minutes. OK?
Two minutes and it'll all be over.

15
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,694
It's totally underground stuff.

16
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:33,090
- I thought we were gonna just...
- No, we will. We will.

17
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,729
You just gotta see this.
I'm telling you, it's...

18
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:39,937
- How about after we?
- No, you need to watch it now.

19
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,891
OK?

20
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,976
What's so scary about it?

21
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,091
You'll see.

22
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:25,852
Play it. Just play the thing.

23
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,659
Come on,
I got two minutes here, please.

24
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,489
Emily, play the goddamn tape!

25
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,616
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, man, you made it.</i>

26
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,817
<i>I knew you'd come through.
You got somebody to watch it, huh?</i>

27
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,092
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, man.

28
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:13,648
Some stupid chick
from my school.

29
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,493
<i>Good. I was afraid
you didn't believe me, man.</i>

30
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,289
<i>Now it's her problem. She doesn't
get someone else to watch it in a week,</i>

31
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:22,291
<i>I swear she's dead.</i>

32
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,530
<i>So, did you tell her what happens</i>

33
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,009
<i>or you just gonna let her
find out for herself?</i>

34
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,089
<i>Jake?</i>

35
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,694
<i>Come on, it's over, dude.</i>

36
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:37,693
<i>Jake. This isn't funny, man.</i>

37
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,135
<i>Jake?</i>

38
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,017
Emily?

39
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,889
Emily!

40
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,212
Emily!

41
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,815
- Emily, what the hell did you do?
- I played it, I just didn't look.

42
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,819
Come on, Aidan, let's go home.

43
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,258
It was the right choice.
No question.

44
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:09,249
Aidan, dinner's ready.

45
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,734
Damn.

46
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,212
Aidan!

47
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:35,648
OK, now, before you say anything,
I followed the recipe this time.

48
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,698
Just 'cause it doesn't look
like the one in the magazine,

49
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,692
doesn't mean to say
it won't taste good.

50
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,213
Those are great, honey.
Got a really good eye.

51
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:57,089
He'd be proud of you.

52
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,811
Thanks, Rachel.

53
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,374
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to call me "mom" now and again.

54
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,735
"Ma. " "Mommy. "

55
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,210
Something besides "Rachel".

56
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,052
Yeah, I like "Rachel".

57
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,734
Well, "mom" has its charms too,
you know.

58
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,936
But "Rachel"
is more your personality.

59
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,214
Really?

60
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:25,730
Well, Rachel declares dinnertime.

61
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,497
It's working out great,
don't you think?

62
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,731
All of this space and fresh air.

63
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:42,256
We have a yard.
It's really great.

64
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,259
Listen, honey...

65
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,217
...we didn't do anything wrong.

66
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,898
We did what anyone would do.

67
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,340
We started over.

68
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,572
Yeah.

69
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,613
- Hey.
- Hey.

70
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,970
Uh, you know how they can tell
you used to work at a real newspaper?

71
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,335
You're the only one
who closes your door.

72
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,490
Habit.

73
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,691
Uh, I wanted to talk
to you about my editorial.

74
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,896
Those changes OK?

75
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,370
Well, I asked you to copy edit it
and you rewrote it.

76
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,576
Just the part
about the bond measure.

77
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,059
That was the whole thing.

78
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,859
The bridge would get
the money, not the riverfront.

79
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:01,014
Yeah. Uh...

80
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:03,534
Rachel.

81
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,417
You know,
a big news day in Astoria

82
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,413
is a school board meeting, a car wreck
and a cat in a tree. That's big news.

83
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:13,129
You sure this is the job
you're looking for?

84
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:15,893
Well, I'm around for my son more.

85
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,618
In Seattle, I wasn't.

86
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,011
Good a reason as any.

87
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:24,456
I'm glad to see you're
settling in. I like the...

88
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,939
Max, while you're here,

89
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,853
have you given any thought
to that piece for tomorrow?

90
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,817
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

91
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,931
<i>It's 442 Ridgecrest.</i>

92
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,170
<i>Repeat that.
It's what?</i>

93
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,899
<i>Ridgecrest. Ridgecrest!</i>

94
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,052
<i>I've talked to the medical
examiner. They're on their way.</i>

95
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,937
<i>Squad 19 to respond.</i>

96
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:48,250
<i>Can we keep
this channel clear?</i>

97
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:50,808
- The police found a body.
- Possible homicide.

98
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,097
- Please, we should be so lucky.
- What are they saying?

99
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,617
"High school student, male, 17.
Address, 442 Ridgecrest.

100
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:01,976
Found the house flooded,
a girlfriend hiding in the basement. "

101
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:06,019
- Suspect or witness, they don't know.
- The guy was dead in front of the TV.

102
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,376
They keep on talking
about his face.

103
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,610
What about his face?

104
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,613
<i>All emergency units,
area Astoria, switch to Tack Five.</i>

105
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,770
Detective.

106
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,932
Detective, you have a minute?
Was it homicide or wasn't it?

107
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,533
You know how he died.

108
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,376
I just have
a few last questions.

109
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:54,338
If you could walk me
through it again.

110
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,812
It's just horrible.
So young.

111
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,051
No.

112
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,332
No, please, not here.

113
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,492
I found you.

114
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,371
We only made one copy.

115
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:09,370
Oh, God.

116
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,055
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hold on.

117
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,573
- Yeah?
- Hi.

118
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,970
- Rachel Keller from the Daily Astorian.
- We'll make a statement.

119
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,893
- I need to know about the girl.
- We'll make a statement.

120
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,777
She hasn't said a word, has she?

121
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,890
You're welcome to wait.
Excuse me.

122
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:37,453
Watch your step.
Have a seat here, OK?

123
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,373
Have a seat.
I just want you to relax for me.

124
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,893
You can't keep her.

125
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,938
- Focus on the walls.
- We wanna take her.

126
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,614
- She'll talk to us.
- I understand.

127
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,055
I'm just gonna ask
a few questions. Please.

128
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,416
- Be right back, Emily.
- Thank you. Thank you.

129
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,254
All right. Give me his number.
Yeah. All right.

130
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,770
Emily.

131
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,539
Emily, listen to me.
I know what happened.

132
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,133
I know.

133
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,292
Now, you have to tell me.
The tape.

134
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,889
Did you watch it?

135
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:33,491
Do you know who else
has watched it?

136
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:38,130
Has anyone else watched it?

137
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,048
Then where is it?

138
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,974
Hey, you.
Get away from her. Ray.

139
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,416
Emily, talk to me.

140
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,331
I want her out of here.
Now.

141
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,014
You can tell me, Emily.

142
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,451
No.

143
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,049
Not here, Samara.

144
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:41,131
Not here.

145
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,138
Rachel?

146
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,571
Rachel?

147
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,537
Rachel?

148
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,771
Rachel!

149
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:45,172
Rachel! Rachel!

150
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,491
Honey, what is it?

151
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,775
What's wrong? Huh?

152
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,328
Look at me. Shh.

153
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:55,730
- OK? What is it?
- I had a nightmare.

154
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,938
That's all right.
We all have them.

155
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,737
Oh, God, you're soaked.
And you're freezing.

156
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,857
Let's get you out of
these clothes. Come on.

157
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,293
Aidan?

158
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,374
What happened in your nightmare?

159
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,011
I woke up and you weren't here.
You weren't here.

160
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:25,538
I'm here now, honey.
I'm right here, OK?

161
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,978
Listen.

162
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:32,894
All you have to do is call my
name and I'll follow your voice.

163
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:36,328
OK?

164
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:41,532
Even if I have to come right down
into that nightmare with you.

165
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,697
So tell me what happened.

166
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,450
Hmm?

167
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,893
I don't remember.

168
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,133
You don't remember?

169
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:56,011
I don't remember.

170
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,569
Aidan.

171
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,613
Aidan.

172
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,852
Aidan.

173
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:45,737
Honey. You heard me?

174
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,651
I've been calling your name.

175
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,930
I'm... sorry.

176
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:55,299
- You ready to go?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

177
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,218
OK.

178
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,537
So we'll just swing by
and see what they have, OK?

179
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,737
And you can keep a watch on
the backyard stuff. How's that?

180
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:10,089
Look at all this stuff.
Who do you think buys this crap?

181
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,656
Rachel.

182
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,458
Sorry.

183
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,819
What's wrong, honey?
You all right? Huh?

184
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,174
Mm-hmm.

185
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,854
I'm just a little cold, Rachel.

186
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,649
- I'm gonna take a look around.
- All right.

187
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:30,531
Stay close.

188
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,417
Would you like a marble, ma'am?

189
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,092
Aidan?

190
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,774
Aidan?

191
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,291
Aidan.

192
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,374
Aidan?

193
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,735
You gotta wait
for the whistle.

194
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,779
Here I go!

195
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,577
Aidan.

196
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:02,295
Aidan!

197
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,618
Are you in there?

198
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,337
Aidan?

199
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,892
Why didn't you answer me, honey?
What are you?

200
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,094
Jesus.

201
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,014
Jesus, you're freezing, honey.
What's going on? Are you sick?

202
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,692
Talk to me, honey.

203
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,340
Talk to me. What's going on?

204
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:33,457
- What is it?
- I'm cold.

205
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:41,496
It's OK. It's OK.

206
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,329
Honey, when did this start?

207
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,456
Was it last night,

208
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,610
or this morning?

209
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,770
I don't remember.

210
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,613
I know you don't like me prying,
but this is important.

211
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,460
Was it your nightmare?

212
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,371
I really don't remember, Rachel.

213
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,530
I need you to try.

214
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:20,370
You're sick, all right? And we
need to know what started it.

215
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,496
Aidan.

216
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:29,216
Was she in your nightmare?

217
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:39,813
Rachel!

218
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,493
Don't stop.

219
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,814
Don't stop.

220
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:00,619
- Go! Drive! Drive!
- What's the matter, honey?

221
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,258
Just don't stop the car!

222
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,609
Get down!

223
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,809
"Don't stop. "

224
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,653
You said, "Don't stop. "

225
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,057
Don't stop.

226
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,971
OK. Let's see.

227
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,772
That's impossible.

228
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,730
Rachel...

229
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,059
...what's happening?

230
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,777
Yeah, hi, um...

231
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,737
My son is very sick

232
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,970
and I'd like to
talk to someone who...

233
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:29,659
Well, it's his temperature.
It's... it's five degrees low.

234
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,175
Yeah. Well, then,
I'll hold for the on-call nurse.

235
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,978
Hello?

236
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,053
Hello?

237
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,979
Aidan?

238
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,450
Honey, the power just went out.
Are you OK up there?

239
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,298
Aidan?

240
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,779
Honey, this shouldn't be open.

241
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,213
God.

242
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:12,297
Aidan, let's go. Get out of bed.

243
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,691
Aidan, what are you
doing over there?

244
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,290
Get back in bed right now.

245
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:27,133
I saw something.

246
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,091
Aidan...

247
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,297
Move! Get away.
Get away from there.

248
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:46,733
Honey, let's go. Come on.

249
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,215
I saw it.

250
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,372
- I saw it in my head.
- Let's go.

251
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,651
Oh, Miss Keller...

252
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,812
- About my story. I...
- Not now.

253
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,650
Now, listen, sweetie.
Last night I found a tape.

254
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,617
It was one of hers.

255
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:45,851
And I made it so we'd never
have to see it again.

256
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,851
But if she knows that,

257
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,250
what I did might
make her wanna hurt us.

258
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:58,891
Am I right?
Do you know something, honey?

259
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,892
Look, if you know why she's here,
you have to tell me.

260
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:04,414
Aidan...

261
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:07,139
...is she here to hurt you?

262
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,736
Honey.

263
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,018
She can hear us.

264
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:25,096
She hears everything.

265
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:29,811
Except when we sleep.

266
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,016
She can't hear us
when we sleep?

267
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,778
What does that mean?

268
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,169
We have to sleep.

269
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,337
Rachel,
may I come in, please?

270
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,172
Yeah.

271
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,130
What happened to your car?

272
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,097
Your car. Apparently it's wrecked.

273
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,650
- Are you guys OK?
- Yeah. We got hit.

274
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,856
And no one's hurt?

275
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,500
That's good.

276
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:04,129
Aidan, right? Hi, I'm Max.

277
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:08,533
- Is he all right?
- He's sick.

278
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,417
How sick?

279
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,378
Max,

280
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:20,337
I need your help.

281
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:55,093
Here.

282
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,136
I'll get some more blankets.

283
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:00,053
The house is yours if there's
anything you need at all.

284
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,256
OK. Thanks.

285
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,978
- Here.
- Thank you.

286
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,858
- Shouldn't he be at a hospital?
- No, he's fine.

287
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,134
The bath?

288
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,814
Just down the hall.
I'll get it started.

289
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,618
Honey.

290
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,649
I'm gonna go home
and get some of our things.

291
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:22,418
Then we'll leave here
and never come back, OK?

292
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:28,012
Let's get you warmed up.

293
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,694
Not the best water pressure,
but it works.

294
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,419
It's good, thanks.
I don't know why we lost power.

295
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,694
The block seemed fine.

296
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,658
I have plenty of candles
in case the problem spreads.

297
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,696
Go ahead and get in.
Get you warmed up.

298
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,214
Max, I just need
to go back to my house,

299
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,416
get a few things,
some medicine.

300
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,297
Do you mind if you could?

301
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,689
- I'll watch him. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

302
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,499
Honey, go ahead and get in.
Let's go. Let's go.

303
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,898
We need to raise your temperature.
Now, let's get in.

304
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:59,017
Aidan, what's wrong?
It's just water.

305
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,456
- We need to raise your temperature...
- I don't want to, Rachel.

306
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,815
Do you want me
to get in with you?

307
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,575
Let's go then.
Aidan. Come on, let's go.

308
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,257
That's it.

309
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,218
Come on, honey.
Let's go. Let's go.

310
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,495
That's it. That's it.

311
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,451
That's better, right?

312
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:23,169
See? It's nice and warm.

313
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,650
It's OK. Just relax.

314
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,378
Hello?

315
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,736
Officer Ray. How you doing?

316
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,256
Yeah, good, good. All right,
what do you got for me?

317
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:43,093
Mm-hmm. Right.

318
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,296
Yeah. Yeah.

319
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,452
Yeah, well, that all
sounds like page 26.

320
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,610
You don't have any headlines?

321
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,497
No?

322
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,810
Well, business is business.

323
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:59,131
Yeah. No, no, I'm good.
Real good.

324
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,814
Could you do me a little favour
while I've got you?

325
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:04,175
Could you look into
your accident reports

326
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,297
and see if there was an accident
with a woman and her son?

327
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:09,416
"K" for Keller.

328
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,968
No, no, I'm just trying
to get a story straight.

329
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,453
Ray?

330
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:18,100
Ray, let me call you right back. OK.

331
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,499
Everything OK in there?

332
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:36,890
Uh, Aidan, could you, uh,
unlock the door, please?

333
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,211
Aidan, can you hear me?

334
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,296
Aidan, please, unlock the door!

335
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,654
Aidan, open the door!

336
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:02,690
Aidan. Aidan. Aidan!

337
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,135
He's in the bath.
It was open a second ago.

338
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,178
- Aidan, open the door!
- I'll get something to break it.

339
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,013
Aidan, open up the door.
I'm right here.

340
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,136
Honey, can you hear me? Please.

341
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:15,211
You need to open up the door.

342
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:16,813
Aidan!

343
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:23,531
Aidan.

344
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,058
Oh, my God.

345
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,094
Aidan!

346
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:37,408
Aidan.

347
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,809
Please, honey, open the...

348
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,496
Oh, my God.

349
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,492
Oh!

350
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,377
Aidan.

351
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:04,492
Aidan. Aidan.

352
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,777
Look at me. Aidan, look at me.
Look at me.

353
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:34,814
Mommy!

354
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:49,530
Rachel, no!

355
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,456
Baby. Oh.

356
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,212
Oh, my God.
Baby, I'm sorry.

357
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:05,217
It wasn't him. It wasn't him.

358
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,972
I was just trying to help.

359
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:10,848
OK, Rachel, let's just
get him out of there.

360
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:21,018
Why is she doing this to me?

361
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,453
I'm here now, baby.

362
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,418
- Why is she doing this to me?
- It's OK, Aidan.

363
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,094
- We're gonna get you to a hospital.
- No!

364
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,216
They can't do anything.

365
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,530
You asked for help,
you're gonna get help.

366
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:34,338
He gets to a hospital. Now.

367
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:55,339
We're working to raise
his core temperature.

368
00:46:55,420 --> 00:46:57,297
He was at 90 degrees
when he came in.

369
00:46:57,380 --> 00:47:02,579
- He wasn't outside overnight?
- No. He was at home with me.

370
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:05,857
A body doesn't develop
severe hypothermia on its own.

371
00:47:05,940 --> 00:47:09,694
Whatever the cause, he's fighting it.
Seems like he's stabilizing.

372
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,136
- And he's just sleeping now?
- Right.

373
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,973
And having some kind of dream.

374
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,774
What's the story, Rachel?

375
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:40,256
They stabilized his temperature.

376
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,649
I mean the story
with you and Aidan.

377
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,776
You seem awfully hard on him.

378
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:54,099
Look, I know
it's a stressful time for you.

379
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,331
Moving. It's a whole new life.

380
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:01,218
Maybe you should tell me.

381
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,777
All I ever tried to do for him
was the right thing,

382
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,249
and it only ever
made things worse.

383
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:15,457
Then it wasn't
the right thing, was it?

384
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,735
What do you see?

385
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:39,411
Well, it's Aidan.

386
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:44,415
- Is that a girl there?
- Why is she in the picture?

387
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,333
- Why? How would I know?
- Why is she in all of them?

388
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:52,210
Her name's Samara.

389
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:57,818
She was murdered by her mother.
Left to die at the bottom of a well.

390
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:02,171
- Wait, she's... she's who?
- She didn't die.

391
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:06,856
At least, not her ghost.
I kept it alive for Aidan.

392
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,932
I let it out,
it spread and then we ran.

393
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:13,979
- What are you talking about?
- I know this sounds crazy,

394
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:18,338
but she's here now.
She's found us.

395
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,456
And I thought it was
just to hurt Aidan,

396
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:24,135
but it's more than that.
She wants to be him.

397
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,735
And she wants to live
for real this time.

398
00:49:34,860 --> 00:49:38,739
You tell me, who can help me?

399
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,298
- Who?
- I'm sure there's a rational...

400
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,894
You take his picture
and tell me why she's in it.

401
00:49:44,980 --> 00:49:47,175
- Rachel.
- You take his picture.

402
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:50,809
It's proof that he's what?
He's got a ghost inside him?

403
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:54,688
No. The proof
is what will happen.

404
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:06,135
Aidan,

405
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,179
you said Samara
couldn't hear us when we sleep.

406
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:13,888
Well, you're sleeping now.

407
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:19,333
Tell me how to stop her, honey.

408
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:22,371
Tell me how to help you.

409
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:25,418
Just tell me,
I'll do anything, I swear.

410
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:35,696
Aidan?

411
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,740
- Aidan?
- Miss Keller?

412
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,693
Hello, I'm Dr Emma Temple.

413
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,853
I'm a consulting physician
at County Child Services.

414
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:51,773
Well, I was hoping to speak
with Aidan when he wakes up.

415
00:51:54,740 --> 00:51:57,174
Is everything all right in here?

416
00:51:57,260 --> 00:51:59,649
Yeah. It's fine. Thank you.

417
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:02,334
I was hoping
to speak with you as well.

418
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:07,369
It's Rachel, isn't it?
Yeah, about his situation.

419
00:52:07,460 --> 00:52:10,770
Sorry, what kind
of doctor did you say you were again?

420
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:12,259
I'm a psychiatrist.

421
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:17,255
Yeah. I spoke with a Dr, um...

422
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:20,059
...Koji in Seattle. Aidan's doctor.

423
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,574
Look, if we could
maybe talk later.

424
00:52:22,660 --> 00:52:27,973
Right. Um, Dr Koji mentioned
that you dealt with some PPD

425
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:30,130
when Aidan was born.

426
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:31,653
Postpartum depression.

427
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:33,731
That was the first month.
That's all.

428
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:36,095
I understand. It's very common.

429
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:40,298
I mean, a lot of women have trouble
adapting to the stresses of motherhood.

430
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:44,771
What does this have to do with
what's going on with my son right now?

431
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:48,170
Have you been
under stress lately?

432
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:51,696
Have you ever found that you were...

433
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:54,977
...unable to experience love for Aidan?

434
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,575
- What?
- Have you hurt him,

435
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,093
however unintentionally?

436
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,819
Have you left him alone?
Abandoned him?

437
00:53:02,900 --> 00:53:06,779
I'd like to be with my son,
please, if you don't mind.

438
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,970
Yeah, of course.

439
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:14,370
I'm sorry, Rachel.

440
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,973
Until we can talk further,

441
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:22,735
I cannot let you be alone with him.

442
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:25,219
I'm his mother.

443
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:29,692
There are bruises on his body.

444
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,692
He was hypothermic
and very near death.

445
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:34,930
That is not because of me.

446
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:41,774
He's gonna
be all right. He will.

447
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,135
But you need to leave.

448
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,415
Now, please.

449
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:55,171
You can't have him,
Samara.

450
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,889
You're going back
to where you came from.

451
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:26,577
All I wanna know is what her
history was before the Morgans.

452
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:29,015
I'm sorry, but the
privacy laws still apply.

453
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:33,093
Well, was she really adopted?
Can you at least tell me that much?

454
00:54:33,180 --> 00:54:36,411
- Was their story true?
- Samara Morgan was adopted, yes.

455
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:39,173
But you won't tell me from who?

456
00:54:39,260 --> 00:54:42,457
- I'd lose my job if I did.
- Look, ma'am,

457
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:46,249
my son has a medical condition
that his doctors don't even understand.

458
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:48,490
This little girl
had the same condition.

459
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:52,732
Now, if I knew what caused that,
it could save his life.

460
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:56,699
All I can say is you
should speak to the Morgans.

461
00:54:56,780 --> 00:55:00,534
They're dead.
They both killed themselves.

462
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,092
Whoa! Look out. Early birds.

463
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:33,375
Marty Savide,
Stevens Northwest Realty.

464
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:35,769
- Hi.
- Uh, come in.

465
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,136
I thought I put 12.30 on the ad.
For the open house.

466
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,734
- How'd you get around the gate?
- Well, I just...

467
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,412
Ah! Who cares? Come on.

468
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:47,254
Make me an offer
over asking and it's yours.

469
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,979
OK, then, don't mind me.

470
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,258
My first try with these things,
took off flying.

471
00:56:55,020 --> 00:56:56,931
There we go.

472
00:56:57,020 --> 00:56:58,851
What do you think?

473
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,853
Um, a little colour will really
turn the place around.

474
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,692
It's got a wonderful history.

475
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,736
Working horse ranch.
How about that?

476
00:57:06,820 --> 00:57:11,530
And there's even this cute little
tree house thing way up in the barn.

477
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,011
Um, is the place being
sold unfurnished or?

478
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,694
The previous owners
didn't leave anything behind?

479
00:57:18,780 --> 00:57:24,138
Well, there were some things
that were left, after they...

480
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,369
...moved.

481
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,894
We're storing all that
in the basement.

482
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,971
There's a basement?

483
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:34,053
Uh... Well, you betcha.
No extra charge.

484
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:36,096
Right this way.

485
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,333
Uh, if you don't mind,
I'm the welcome wagon.

486
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:50,376
Gotta open up the gate for everyone.

487
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:52,496
So please,
just make yourself at home.

488
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:56,892
Do you know what happened
to them? The previous owners?

489
00:57:56,980 --> 00:57:59,130
I believe they bought
a condo in Phoenix.

490
00:57:59,220 --> 00:58:00,494
Really?

491
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:20,450
Her mother.

492
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:53,410
I'll take it from here.

493
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:01,976
Hello, Aidan, I'm Dr Temple.

494
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:03,459
How are you feeling?

495
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:08,696
Aidan?

496
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:13,975
You know,
I'd really like to help you.

497
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,177
Can you tell me
how you're feeling?

498
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,852
Where's my mommy?

499
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:25,013
Well, she'll be here soon.
She's on her way.

500
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:27,614
I want Mommy.

501
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,577
Yeah, I know you do.

502
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,855
Your mommy
wants to be with you too.

503
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:34,579
So where is she?

504
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:36,298
She went home.

505
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:39,099
She didn't think that you
were gonna wake up so soon.

506
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:40,818
I wanna go home too.

507
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:43,130
Well, you will.

508
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:47,099
We just have to...
We just have to get you...

509
01:02:50,820 --> 01:02:52,856
You're freezing.

510
01:02:54,060 --> 01:02:56,290
I wanna go home to Mommy.

511
01:02:58,300 --> 01:03:01,770
Well, we need to talk about her.

512
01:03:01,860 --> 01:03:04,658
Can you tell me
about Mommy a little bit?

513
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,819
She loves me.

514
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:10,856
I know that she does.

515
01:03:10,940 --> 01:03:15,377
She went looking for me.
She tried to find me.

516
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,735
It means she loves me.

517
01:03:18,820 --> 01:03:20,697
I don't understand.

518
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,658
Can I go home now?

519
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:30,299
No, honey,
you're not well enough.

520
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,532
Can I go home?

521
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:37,733
No.

522
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,450
I'm sorry.

523
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:58,537
Then I have
to show you something.

524
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,452
It won't stop.

525
01:05:37,860 --> 01:05:41,296
I'm gonna walk you
just around the corner here.

526
01:05:55,260 --> 01:05:58,297
Her name was Evelyn.

527
01:05:58,380 --> 01:06:00,769
She came to us
eight months pregnant.

528
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,612
- Did she have her baby here?
- Yes.

529
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,531
And you arranged
for the adoption?

530
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,178
That's right.

531
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:10,048
- And the father?
- There was none.

532
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:13,970
Half the mothers
that come to us say that.

533
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:16,893
So, what did she think
got her pregnant?

534
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:18,049
Evelyn wasn't well.

535
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,859
She had been having problems
during the pregnancy:

536
01:06:20,940 --> 01:06:23,295
Hallucinations, visions.

537
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:26,656
She believed some thing
had come for her baby

538
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:29,095
from the waters of the world
beyond this one.

539
01:06:29,180 --> 01:06:31,330
I'm sorry. Did you say water?

540
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:36,016
Well, we all envision
the afterlife differently.

541
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:40,855
For Evelyn,
it's just what she believed.

542
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:44,899
As you might imagine, she suffered
severe postpartum depression.

543
01:06:44,980 --> 01:06:48,097
She blamed her troubles
on her child.

544
01:06:48,180 --> 01:06:50,978
So she tried to kill it.

545
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,133
All babies are a challenge.

546
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:03,532
But Samara, she never cried.

547
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,451
Never.

548
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:07,929
Except when her mother
would try to bathe her.

549
01:07:08,020 --> 01:07:11,854
Then she'd scream like it
was the end of the world.

550
01:07:16,820 --> 01:07:18,697
It was the screaming that woke us.

551
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:29,374
Evelyn, don't!

552
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:36,336
Evelyn!

553
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,570
Evelyn, stop!

554
01:07:50,780 --> 01:07:52,930
She was trying
to drown the baby.

555
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:55,329
The baby was taken from her,
of course.

556
01:07:55,420 --> 01:07:57,809
Evelyn was institutionalized.

557
01:07:57,900 --> 01:08:00,334
And all those pictures
she'd been collecting,

558
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:03,457
they finally made sense.

559
01:08:06,580 --> 01:08:09,492
Did she say why she did it?

560
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:12,970
She felt she had to kill
her baby to save it.

561
01:09:10,620 --> 01:09:13,009
I'm here to see a patient.
Her name's Evelyn.

562
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:15,660
- I don't know her last name.
- Evelyn?

563
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:17,776
That's right.

564
01:09:19,700 --> 01:09:21,497
Evelyn's expecting you.

565
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,048
Every few years, one of you
comes to see Evelyn.

566
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:27,177
She's like a freakin'
patron saint or something.

567
01:09:27,260 --> 01:09:29,899
Got a problem with your kid,
don't you?

568
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,536
Something wrong?

569
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:40,817
That song. I know it.

570
01:09:40,900 --> 01:09:42,856
Yeah. They all do.

571
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,812
Hey, Evelyn.

572
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:54,688
You were right as rain.
You got a visitor today.

573
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,248
Hope she's some help
to your troubles.

574
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,251
Ten minutes.

575
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:08,012
My name's Rachel.

576
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,091
But you know that.

577
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:18,611
Some days I
sort of have a feeling.

578
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:21,935
A feeling?

579
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:24,693
This is about your child.

580
01:10:28,580 --> 01:10:29,569
It's...

581
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:34,454
It's about yours.

582
01:10:34,540 --> 01:10:36,451
Samara.

583
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:46,015
They don't dream, you know.

584
01:10:47,060 --> 01:10:49,130
The dead don't dream.

585
01:10:52,940 --> 01:10:54,976
Look, something's happened
to my son.

586
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:58,097
- You have to sleep to dream.
- It has to do with your daughter.

587
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:00,057
And the dead never sleep.

588
01:11:00,140 --> 01:11:01,414
They wait...

589
01:11:02,980 --> 01:11:05,369
...and watch for a way back.

590
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:10,299
But they never sleep.

591
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:13,178
- That's why dreams are safe.
- I'm sorry, I just...

592
01:11:13,260 --> 01:11:16,809
I don't have a lot of time.
Please, I need your help.

593
01:11:16,900 --> 01:11:18,970
I have to know.
Can you tell me?

594
01:11:20,620 --> 01:11:22,815
Why did you try
to kill your baby?

595
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:26,691
Why?

596
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,171
Because my baby told me to.

597
01:11:31,380 --> 01:11:33,530
Just like yours will tell you.

598
01:11:33,620 --> 01:11:36,771
And you have to do it.

599
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,613
- You have to send it back.
- What?

600
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:48,451
They stopped me.

601
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:51,771
- Don't let them stop you.
- What?

602
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,450
Listen to the voices.

603
01:11:55,540 --> 01:11:57,337
What are you talking about?

604
01:11:57,420 --> 01:12:00,173
Because it's our fault. We did it.

605
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:02,455
Yes. We did it. Yes.

606
01:12:02,540 --> 01:12:04,451
It was you.
It was you! You did it!

607
01:12:04,540 --> 01:12:06,053
What did I do?

608
01:12:08,420 --> 01:12:11,173
Evelyn, that's enough.

609
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,538
I love my son.

610
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,259
Come on. It's all right.

611
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:22,050
I'm sorry, ma'am,
that's enough for today.

612
01:12:22,140 --> 01:12:23,653
Let's go.

613
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,810
What did I do?

614
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,497
You let the dead get in.

615
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:32,532
Let's go.

616
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:47,331
What should I do?

617
01:12:48,980 --> 01:12:51,289
Be a good mother.

618
01:12:52,540 --> 01:12:55,293
Listen to your baby.

619
01:12:58,980 --> 01:13:01,050
Listen to your baby.

620
01:13:06,580 --> 01:13:08,855
Listen to your baby.

621
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:14,899
Listen to your baby.

622
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,657
Aidan?

623
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:04,016
Hey.

624
01:14:06,700 --> 01:14:08,452
Shouldn't you, uh...

625
01:14:08,540 --> 01:14:10,292
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

626
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:13,338
No. I'm here
waiting for my mommy.

627
01:14:13,420 --> 01:14:15,490
OK.

628
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:20,415
Well, you can't really leave
till the hospital says it's OK.

629
01:14:20,500 --> 01:14:23,139
You were very, very sick.

630
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,896
You're all right now?

631
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,653
The cable setup at my house,

632
01:14:33,740 --> 01:14:37,494
the TV needs to be
on channel three.

633
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:40,970
<i>She loves me.
She loves me not.</i>

634
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,574
- Thank you, Max.
- Sure.

635
01:14:45,620 --> 01:14:48,009
<i>She loves me!</i>

636
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:50,660
<i>Look, Mandy!</i>

637
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,337
<i>I think I'm gonna puke.</i>

638
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:57,332
<i>Why don't you do something
productive with your life?</i>

639
01:14:59,100 --> 01:15:01,853
<i>Say, Billy,
if you like fish so much...</i>

640
01:15:01,940 --> 01:15:03,498
Your mom loves you, you know.

641
01:15:04,420 --> 01:15:06,456
She loves you a lot.

642
01:15:09,940 --> 01:15:12,579
You'd tell someone if you
weren't sure about that?

643
01:15:12,660 --> 01:15:17,609
Like, if she'd been
hurting you somehow.

644
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:21,660
Did she ever treat you
like you're someone else?

645
01:15:21,740 --> 01:15:24,971
I'm not somebody else.
I'm Aidan.

646
01:15:25,060 --> 01:15:26,971
- I know.
- We don't need anyone else.

647
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:28,379
That's right.

648
01:15:28,460 --> 01:15:33,295
We don't need you,
that doctor or anyone else.

649
01:15:33,380 --> 01:15:35,211
OK?

650
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:39,131
OK.

651
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,213
What are you doing?

652
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:57,334
I was just gonna
take a picture of you.

653
01:15:57,420 --> 01:16:00,139
No.

654
01:16:01,740 --> 01:16:03,571
- It'll be for your mom.
- No.

655
01:16:03,660 --> 01:16:06,572
Why not? What's wrong
with taking your picture?

656
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:10,130
I'll tell you what's wrong
if you promise not to take it.

657
01:16:10,220 --> 01:16:11,972
But that's only if you promise.

658
01:16:12,060 --> 01:16:14,779
Fine. I promise.

659
01:16:23,180 --> 01:16:24,693
So, Aidan, what's the story?

660
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:49,255
<i>We're happy when we're sad</i>

661
01:16:49,340 --> 01:16:52,616
<i>We're always feeling sad</i>

662
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,691
Hello?

663
01:16:54,780 --> 01:16:58,170
<i>- How are you?
- Terrible.</i>

664
01:16:58,260 --> 01:17:04,051
<i>That's why we're happy
when we're sad</i>

665
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:11,818
Max?

666
01:17:13,700 --> 01:17:15,656
Are you here?

667
01:17:27,220 --> 01:17:28,858
- You're home!
- God.

668
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:31,773
What are you doing?
I thought you were at the hospital.

669
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:34,135
No. I'm here, Mommy.

670
01:17:36,580 --> 01:17:40,732
- What did you say?
- I said I'm here.

671
01:17:42,660 --> 01:17:44,571
Is Max here?

672
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,531
No.

673
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:49,929
But his coat...

674
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:00,649
He went away.
You wanna watch some TV with me?

675
01:18:00,740 --> 01:18:02,776
Uh...

676
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,291
I, uh, I just have to get
something from the car. OK?

677
01:18:15,820 --> 01:18:18,334
I love you, Mommy.

678
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:57,372
Max.

679
01:19:07,100 --> 01:19:08,419
Max?

680
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:50,094
<i>Goldfish must have water
in order to exist.</i>

681
01:19:50,180 --> 01:19:53,331
<i>But goldfish hate cats.</i>

682
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:03,213
<i>While on the other hand,
cats hate water.</i>

683
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,650
Rachel.

684
01:20:40,060 --> 01:20:42,620
Are you sleeping, Rachel?

685
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:47,499
I am. She makes me sleep
all the time now.

686
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,218
Aidan.

687
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,768
Shh.
Just keep sleeping, Rachel.

688
01:20:51,860 --> 01:20:55,330
So she can't hear us.
It's the only way.

689
01:20:55,420 --> 01:20:57,695
You have to show her, Rachel.

690
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,133
Show her she can't stay.

691
01:20:59,220 --> 01:21:02,257
In you.

692
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:05,810
How? How do I do that?

693
01:21:05,900 --> 01:21:08,892
Take me to where she's afraid of.

694
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:11,653
You know where she's afraid of.

695
01:21:11,740 --> 01:21:13,378
Take me there...

696
01:21:14,700 --> 01:21:16,577
...and kill me.
- Aidan, no.

697
01:21:16,660 --> 01:21:19,493
Shh. Rachel, keep sleeping.

698
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:23,129
She won't stay if she knows
you'll kill me.

699
01:21:23,220 --> 01:21:27,611
- It's the only way.
- I can't do it. I can't.

700
01:21:31,900 --> 01:21:33,299
Then she stays.

701
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:37,975
She's heard us.

702
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:00,851
Honey?

703
01:22:00,940 --> 01:22:03,454
I thought you were sleeping,
Mommy.

704
01:22:04,980 --> 01:22:07,892
I was, but I had a bad dream.

705
01:22:07,980 --> 01:22:10,210
You must've had a nightmare.

706
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:13,975
It's all right.
We all have them.

707
01:22:16,060 --> 01:22:18,415
Will you stay with me now?

708
01:22:18,500 --> 01:22:21,970
- Stay?
- Stay for always.

709
01:22:24,580 --> 01:22:26,411
Yeah. Yeah.

710
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,572
Alrighty.
Let's watch some TV together.

711
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,215
It's kind of late, honey.

712
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:38,214
Don't you think
you should sleep?

713
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,733
I never sleep.

714
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:52,898
Then let Mommy
make you something.

715
01:24:08,780 --> 01:24:11,931
Something wrong?
You seem sad.

716
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:16,135
No, honey, I'm not sad.

717
01:24:17,540 --> 01:24:20,179
I'm just tired, that's all.

718
01:24:21,780 --> 01:24:24,419
Well, now you have me
to protect you.

719
01:24:54,580 --> 01:24:57,970
<i>You ain't the biggest catfish
in the deep blue sea</i>

720
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,575
Take me to where
she's afraid of.

721
01:25:12,660 --> 01:25:14,651
You know where she's afraid of.

722
01:25:16,260 --> 01:25:18,171
You have to show her, Rachel.

723
01:25:18,260 --> 01:25:21,058
Show her she can't stay.

724
01:25:22,900 --> 01:25:24,811
Listen to the voices.

725
01:25:24,900 --> 01:25:27,494
You have to listen to the voices.

726
01:25:31,220 --> 01:25:34,496
Be a good mother.
Be a good mother.

727
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,935
Listen to your baby.

728
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:33,133
I'm sorry.

729
01:26:34,140 --> 01:26:36,415
I'm so sorry.

730
01:26:37,620 --> 01:26:40,214
But you can't stay.

731
01:26:47,100 --> 01:26:50,536
What are you doing? Rachel!

732
01:26:50,620 --> 01:26:52,133
What are you doing?

733
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:53,972
It's me.

734
01:26:54,060 --> 01:26:56,335
- It's not her, Rachel.
- I know, baby.

735
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,695
It's me.

736
01:26:58,780 --> 01:27:01,977
I love you. Mommy, I love you.

737
01:27:02,060 --> 01:27:04,130
I know, baby.

738
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:08,573
I love you too.

739
01:27:20,740 --> 01:27:23,254
But you're not my son.

740
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,655
Mommy.

741
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:16,498
Aidan.

742
01:28:17,540 --> 01:28:21,249
Aidan. Aidan. Aidan.

743
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:28,219
Honey.

744
01:28:30,340 --> 01:28:33,776
Breathe. Baby, breathe.

745
01:28:33,860 --> 01:28:36,897
Please. I know it's you, honey.

746
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:38,891
Aidan.

747
01:28:40,460 --> 01:28:43,054
Aidan, please.

748
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:45,933
Rachel.

749
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:51,497
Yeah.

750
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,889
I'm right here.

751
01:28:55,100 --> 01:28:56,419
You're OK.

752
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:59,572
Everything's all right, honey.

753
01:29:03,060 --> 01:29:05,210
You were sleeping.

754
01:29:05,300 --> 01:29:08,212
You were just sleeping.

755
01:29:24,420 --> 01:29:26,490
No.

756
01:29:38,900 --> 01:29:40,731
She wants me again.

757
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,211
No.

758
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:54,816
Rachel, what are you doing?

759
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:01,496
All she wants is a mother.
That's all she wants.

760
01:30:03,860 --> 01:30:07,569
And she'll keep coming
till she finds one.

761
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:09,651
Come on!
Come back!

762
01:30:09,740 --> 01:30:12,015
Get away from her! Rachel!

763
01:30:12,100 --> 01:30:14,056
Get away from her!

764
01:30:16,740 --> 01:30:18,492
You can't have my son.

765
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:25,213
So take me.

766
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,813
Rachel! No!

767
01:30:32,740 --> 01:30:34,970
Rachel! Rachel!

768
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:12,173
Samara!

769
01:31:13,180 --> 01:31:15,569
Here I am, Samara.

770
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:20,218
Just like you wanted.

771
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:25,696
But you leave him alone!

772
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,418
You hear me?

773
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:36,218
Help me.

774
01:31:45,460 --> 01:31:48,293
It's always open.

775
01:31:48,380 --> 01:31:52,578
Her only way out
is always open.

776
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:18,971
Mommy.

777
01:32:29,700 --> 01:32:32,737
Mommy!

778
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:41,253
Mommy.

779
01:34:30,980 --> 01:34:34,131
- Mommy!
- I'm not your fucking mommy.

780
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,731
Rachel.

781
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:19,337
Rachel.

782
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:25,897
Rachel.

783
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:17,618
Rachel.

784
01:36:20,500 --> 01:36:21,819
Rachel.

785
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:25,529
- Can you hear me?
- I can hear you.

786
01:36:25,620 --> 01:36:27,975
I'm right here.

787
01:36:57,180 --> 01:36:58,295
Rachel.

788
01:37:00,980 --> 01:37:03,016
Rachel!

789
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,971
You're here.

790
01:37:08,660 --> 01:37:12,175
- You're here, Rachel.
- Of course I'm here.

791
01:37:12,260 --> 01:37:15,093
I followed your voice.

792
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,897
What happened?

793
01:37:21,060 --> 01:37:23,620
It's over, honey.

794
01:37:24,580 --> 01:37:27,174
She's not coming back.

795
01:37:27,260 --> 01:37:29,933
How do you know, Rachel?

796
01:37:32,700 --> 01:37:34,770
I know.

797
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:38,491
I promise.

798
01:37:43,380 --> 01:37:45,291
I promise.

799
01:37:45,380 --> 01:37:47,894
I love you, Mommy.

800
01:37:50,060 --> 01:37:52,255
Promise me something?

801
01:37:52,340 --> 01:37:55,810
Yeah. Anything, Mom. Anything.

802
01:37:55,900 --> 01:37:58,289
Just call me Rachel.

803
01:37:59,900 --> 01:38:01,538
At least for a while.
