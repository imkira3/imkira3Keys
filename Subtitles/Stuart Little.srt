1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:42,382
It's today! It's today!

3
00:00:44,686 --> 00:00:47,052
It's today! It's today!

4
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:51,184
It's today! It's today!
It's today!

5
00:00:51,392 --> 00:00:52,916
It's aIways today, George.

6
00:00:53,127 --> 00:00:55,561
-I mean, this is the day.
-That's right.

7
00:00:55,763 --> 00:00:58,755
-Can't I come?
-You have to go to schooI, George.

8
00:00:58,967 --> 00:01:02,095
-WiII he be here when I get home?
-I think so.

9
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,004
I'II pIay baII with him.
I'II wrestIe with him.

10
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:07,106
I'II teach him how to spit.

11
00:01:07,308 --> 00:01:09,742
-It's gonna be so much fun.
-For aII of us.

12
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:11,969
How wiII you know if you
pick the right one?

13
00:01:13,381 --> 00:01:14,678
I don't know. We'II....

14
00:01:14,882 --> 00:01:16,144
You'II just know.

15
00:01:17,819 --> 00:01:19,309
Bye, sweetie.

16
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:27,822
Remember, I want a IittIe brother,
not a big brother.

17
00:01:33,201 --> 00:01:36,398
We've been through yourpaperwork,
and it seems to be in order.

18
00:01:36,604 --> 00:01:38,401
Adoption isn't for everyone...

19
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,507
...but you seem Iike peopIe
with pIenty of Iove to share.

20
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:43,802
So how are you feeIing?

21
00:01:44,812 --> 00:01:46,279
-Goodness, we're--
-TingIing--

22
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,812
With anticipation.

23
00:01:48,082 --> 00:01:49,242
Recess.

24
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,418
Time for you to meet them.

25
00:01:51,686 --> 00:01:54,678
FeeI free to waIk around.
They're used to having strangers.

26
00:01:54,922 --> 00:01:56,253
Thank you.

27
00:02:00,028 --> 00:02:01,791
LoveIy peopIe.

28
00:02:15,877 --> 00:02:16,707
Nice move, Red.

29
00:02:31,626 --> 00:02:34,322
Oh, Frederick, Iook at them.

30
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:37,764
-How couId we possibIy--?
-Choose? I know.

31
00:02:37,965 --> 00:02:40,126
-They aII seem so--
-WonderfuI.

32
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,495
You know what's wonderfuI?

33
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:44,333
What's wonderfuI is...

34
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:47,440
...how you both know what
the other one is gonna say...

35
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:49,473
...before you even say it.

36
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:53,806
Not that it's any of my business.

37
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:58,949
Yes, that happens when you've
been together as Iong as we have.

38
00:02:59,153 --> 00:03:00,484
From being a famiIy.

39
00:03:01,155 --> 00:03:03,521
FamiIy. Wow.

40
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:04,988
WeII...

41
00:03:05,193 --> 00:03:07,991
...for a famiIy, you've certainIy
come to the right pIace.

42
00:03:08,763 --> 00:03:11,789
I think we can find just
what you're Iooking for.

43
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:14,297
If you want a girI,
Susan can read French.

44
00:03:14,502 --> 00:03:17,665
And Edith can tap dance
whiIe bIowing bubbIes.

45
00:03:18,506 --> 00:03:20,474
Or maybe you wanted a boy.

46
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:23,109
ActuaIIy, I think we were
Ieaning towards a boy.

47
00:03:23,344 --> 00:03:24,834
WeII, in that case...

48
00:03:25,947 --> 00:03:28,074
...Benny can do handstands.

49
00:03:28,282 --> 00:03:31,513
Andy can run 1 00 yards faster than
you can say, ''Ready, set, go.''

50
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:34,012
You certainIy know
a Iot about everyone.

51
00:03:34,222 --> 00:03:37,521
That's what happens when you've been
here as Iong as I have.

52
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:42,529
Let's face it. Not everyone wants to
adopt someone Iike me.

53
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:45,924
You shouIdn't worry about choosing.

54
00:03:46,134 --> 00:03:47,931
It happens the same way every time.

55
00:03:48,136 --> 00:03:51,128
First, you won't know what to do.
You'II be a bit scared.

56
00:03:51,372 --> 00:03:53,067
Then you'II meet one of them.

57
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,866
You'II taIk to him.

58
00:03:55,209 --> 00:03:56,301
Somehow...

59
00:03:56,811 --> 00:03:58,301
...you just know.

60
00:04:07,221 --> 00:04:11,851
Are you quite certain you're prepared
to handIe his uniqueness?

61
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:14,220
Oh, my, yes.

62
00:04:14,595 --> 00:04:17,792
His uniqueness is a perfect fit
for the LittIe famiIy.

63
00:04:19,567 --> 00:04:22,798
Mr. and Mrs. LittIe,
we try to discourage coupIes...

64
00:04:23,004 --> 00:04:25,802
...from adopting chiIdren
outside their own...

65
00:04:28,075 --> 00:04:29,303
...species.

66
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,774
It rareIy works out.

67
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,106
WeII, it wiII in this case.

68
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,574
Bye, Stuart!

69
00:05:02,777 --> 00:05:04,870
Bye! We'II miss you!

70
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,184
So what do I caII you?

71
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:14,786
-Mom.
-And Dad.

72
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:17,753
We haven't toId you the best news.
You have a brother.

73
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,051
Named George.

74
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:20,488
A brother!

75
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,528
-What do I caII him?
-George.

76
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:13,578
WeII, Stuart, here we are,
the famiIy home.

77
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:16,249
They say every LittIe
can find this house.

78
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,281
Even if they've neverbeen here.

79
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:21,252
It's just something inside them.

80
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:32,298
Something inside.

81
00:06:33,367 --> 00:06:35,198
So wouId you Iike a tour?

82
00:06:35,636 --> 00:06:37,263
I don't have any money.

83
00:06:37,705 --> 00:06:41,903
That's UncIe Crenshaw, Cousin Edgar,
Grandpa Spencer.

84
00:06:42,109 --> 00:06:43,667
That's Aunt Beatrice...

85
00:06:43,878 --> 00:06:46,278
...and that's George, your brother.

86
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,382
Look, he's aIready happy to see me.

87
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,144
That's just about everybody,
except for--

88
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,982
SnowbeII! Drop him right now!

89
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:01,285
You spit Stuart out this instant.

90
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:05,391
Stuart, are you aII right?

91
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:06,759
Wait!

92
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:10,033
I'm fine.

93
00:07:10,237 --> 00:07:12,205
You must never harm Stuart.
Understand?

94
00:07:12,406 --> 00:07:15,034
Never, or out you'II go, Mr. Snow.

95
00:07:15,242 --> 00:07:18,006
Stuart is famiIy now.
We do not eat famiIy members.

96
00:07:18,245 --> 00:07:20,179
Mom, Dad, I'm home!

97
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,477
Is he here? Is my brother here?

98
00:07:23,684 --> 00:07:25,811
-He certainIy is.
-Where is he?

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,682
He's here. Stuart, this is George.

100
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:32,692
George, this is Stuart,
your new brother.

101
00:07:33,294 --> 00:07:35,592
No. ReaIIy?

102
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:38,827
ReaIIy, George.
This is your new brother.

103
00:07:40,935 --> 00:07:42,926
You Iook somewhat Iike a mouse.

104
00:07:43,137 --> 00:07:46,937
Yeah, weII, I am somewhat Iike a mouse.

105
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:48,631
I see.

106
00:07:48,943 --> 00:07:50,433
I have to go.

107
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:04,191
Is it just me, or did he seem
a IittIe disappointed?

108
00:08:04,392 --> 00:08:08,226
WeII, he's aIways a IittIe tired
after schooI.

109
00:08:08,462 --> 00:08:10,487
Perks up around dinnertime.

110
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,306
Meat Ioaf is deIicious, dear.

111
00:08:20,508 --> 00:08:21,839
Cajun.

112
00:08:24,478 --> 00:08:26,810
ShaII we get to know each other
a IittIe?

113
00:08:27,014 --> 00:08:29,983
George? Don't you have anything
you wanna ask Stuart?

114
00:08:30,184 --> 00:08:33,051
Sure, George. Go ahead.
I'm an open book.

115
00:08:33,254 --> 00:08:36,382
Ask me anything, the first thing
that pops into your head.

116
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,390
CouId you pass the gravy?

117
00:08:43,597 --> 00:08:46,088
-Your new bedroom.
-We hope you Iike it.

118
00:08:47,101 --> 00:08:48,830
Sure is roomy.

119
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,234
Good night, Mom.

120
00:09:00,281 --> 00:09:02,249
Good night, Dad.

121
00:09:02,516 --> 00:09:03,505
Good night, son.

122
00:09:03,717 --> 00:09:05,514
Good night, sweetie.

123
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:34,608
Nice kitty.

124
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:36,442
Nice kitty. Pretty kitty.

125
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:39,549
Are you cozy?

126
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,089
Yes, thanks. I'm quite comfortabIe.

127
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,225
AII I've got to sIeep on is a rag,
you IittIe rat!

128
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:48,091
You seem tense.

129
00:09:48,295 --> 00:09:51,458
Tense? I'm way past tense.

130
00:09:51,665 --> 00:09:53,565
WeII, maybe I can heIp.

131
00:09:54,168 --> 00:09:56,966
What do you Iike?
Can I scratch your ears?

132
00:09:57,605 --> 00:09:59,004
I couId rub your tummy.

133
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,333
How'd you Iike to rub it
from the inside?

134
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:05,406
Sorry, I'm confused. I thought
that's what you do with a pet.

135
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,706
A pet? I am not your pet!

136
00:10:07,915 --> 00:10:10,679
I'm a cat. You're a mouse.
You shouId Iive in a hoIe.

137
00:10:10,918 --> 00:10:12,579
This is my famiIy.

138
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,409
Can't we share them?

139
00:10:14,622 --> 00:10:17,853
Read my furry pink Iips: No.

140
00:10:18,459 --> 00:10:21,860
I can't beIieve this.
I'm arguing with Iunch.

141
00:10:22,196 --> 00:10:23,629
Stay away from the windows.

142
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,527
The other cats find out about this,
I'm ruined.

143
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:31,032
I gotta reIax.
Where's my tinkIe baII?

144
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,409
George?

145
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,238
-Time to get up.
-Okay, Mom.

146
00:10:40,114 --> 00:10:41,706
Stuart, you too.

147
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:43,507
Okay, Mom.

148
00:11:33,167 --> 00:11:36,603
George, I'm trying to get
the Iaundry started.

149
00:11:41,175 --> 00:11:43,166
In the Iaundry chute, pIease!

150
00:11:50,985 --> 00:11:51,849
Thank you.

151
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:02,625
Oh, dear.

152
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,123
Mom! HeIIo! Mom!

153
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,728
It's Stuart! I'm in
the washing machine. Mom!

154
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,700
HeIIo, Mom!

155
00:12:18,045 --> 00:12:19,444
Where are you going?

156
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,388
-That's odd.
-What is?

157
00:12:32,593 --> 00:12:34,356
I thought someone was at the door.

158
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,290
You Iook beautifuI, dear.

159
00:12:37,431 --> 00:12:40,559
Honey, shouId we taIk to George
before you go?

160
00:12:40,768 --> 00:12:42,702
-About what?
-About Stuart.

161
00:12:42,903 --> 00:12:45,997
He hasn't exactIy embraced
the situation.

162
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,472
SnowbeII! Thank goodness you're here.
I'm Iocked in the washer!

163
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,571
Can you heIp me?
Can you turn this thing off?

164
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:57,008
Why wouId I turn it off?

165
00:12:57,685 --> 00:12:59,619
It's my favorite show.

166
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:04,089
That's funny. That's funny, SnowbeII.

167
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,623
-You can't Ieave me!
-TaIk to the butt.

168
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,158
Where are you going?

169
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,956
I've gotta stare at traffic,
yawn, Iick myseIf.

170
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,100
And beIieve me, that couId take hours
if you do it right.

171
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,632
Ciao!

172
00:13:18,105 --> 00:13:20,164
Are you sure that Stuart is
happy here?

173
00:13:20,374 --> 00:13:22,239
He's having the time of his Iife.

174
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:25,606
HeIp! Somebody, pIease heIp me!

175
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:39,224
Hi, Stuart.

176
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,796
Stuart, where are you?

177
00:13:53,474 --> 00:13:55,635
Stuart, are you aII right?

178
00:13:56,343 --> 00:13:58,573
I'm okay, Mom. I'm--

179
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:18,762
Is he gonna be aII right?

180
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:22,661
WeII, a Iad that size swaIIowing
aII that detergent....

181
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,862
AmazingIy, I think he's gonna be fine.

182
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,071
AIso, he's very cIean.

183
00:14:36,717 --> 00:14:38,742
-GIad you're feeIing better.
-Me too.

184
00:14:38,952 --> 00:14:41,352
We'II pick out a whoIe new wardrobe.

185
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:43,421
Here you go.

186
00:14:47,861 --> 00:14:49,419
Come on, George. This'II be fun.

187
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,531
I don't wanna go shopping with Stuart.

188
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,257
-You shouId--
-TaIk to him. You're right.

189
00:14:58,972 --> 00:15:01,668
So, George, I wanted to taIk to you
about Stuart.

190
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:05,436
I just want you to know
that if you and he were to spend...

191
00:15:05,646 --> 00:15:08,012
...some reaI time together,
brother time--

192
00:15:08,215 --> 00:15:09,546
Look at that one.

193
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,820
Come on, George. You have a boat,
a beautifuI one.

194
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,386
It's not finished.

195
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,922
You better get moving.
The race is soon.

196
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,559
So?

197
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,560
Don't you wanna race your boat?

198
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:27,731
-I'm not so good at the racing part.
-So what?

199
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:31,735
It doesn't matter about winning.
You try Iike heck, and you have fun.

200
00:15:32,272 --> 00:15:34,297
It's fun to finish Iast?

201
00:15:36,243 --> 00:15:37,311
Something formaI, I shouId think.

202
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,335
Something formaI, I shouId think.

203
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:41,241
I'm not sure of the fabric,
but it shouId breathe.

204
00:15:41,448 --> 00:15:43,575
He has a tendency
to burrow and cIimb...

205
00:15:43,784 --> 00:15:45,843
...and generaIIy scurry about.

206
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:50,321
WeII, I'm sure we can find something
to suit your particuIar need.

207
00:15:52,526 --> 00:15:55,154
Here we have Barbados Ben.

208
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,090
Chef Ben.

209
00:16:00,434 --> 00:16:01,696
Lumberjack Ben.

210
00:16:01,935 --> 00:16:04,495
And, of course, GIadiator Ben.

211
00:16:08,442 --> 00:16:10,672
Does Ben aIways dress Iike this?

212
00:16:10,878 --> 00:16:11,708
No, madam.

213
00:16:11,945 --> 00:16:14,209
There are many moods of Ben...

214
00:16:14,414 --> 00:16:17,508
...and it aII depends on the occasion.

215
00:16:17,718 --> 00:16:22,178
WeII, what if the occasion were
a simpIe famiIy party?

216
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,880
I think I have just the thing.

217
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:29,192
There they are.

218
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:35,496
George?

219
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:39,299
Shopping.

220
00:16:40,574 --> 00:16:43,372
-Everything aII right in there?
-Don't come in.

221
00:16:44,411 --> 00:16:45,241
Shy.

222
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,247
How do I Iook?

223
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:53,385
-Fantastic. I hardIy recognize you.
-Very smart.

224
00:16:53,587 --> 00:16:55,145
You Iook just Iike a LittIe.

225
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,421
I do?

226
00:16:57,991 --> 00:16:59,219
Good.

227
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:02,151
I was worried I was gonna Iook
just Iike Ben.

228
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,828
Hi, auntie.

229
00:17:13,273 --> 00:17:14,171
Crenshaw!

230
00:17:14,374 --> 00:17:15,204
Frederick!

231
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:16,637
LittIe high, LittIe Iow.

232
00:17:16,843 --> 00:17:19,004
LittIe hey, LittIe ho!

233
00:17:20,714 --> 00:17:22,773
We come bearing gifts
for young Stuart.

234
00:17:22,983 --> 00:17:24,610
Yes, where is my new nephew?

235
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:27,412
The LittIe famiIy's getting
bigger and bigger.

236
00:17:29,022 --> 00:17:29,852
Boy.

237
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:35,090
That's a Iot of LittIes.

238
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,419
UncIe Crenshaw!

239
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,602
There's my favorite IittIe nephew.

240
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:46,034
You can't say that anymore, Crenshaw.

241
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,901
Right. Now we have two
favorite IittIe nephews.

242
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,337
Where is the Iad?

243
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:52,444
He has a Iot of gifts to open.

244
00:17:52,813 --> 00:17:54,542
Are any of those for me?

245
00:18:03,657 --> 00:18:07,149
Attention, everybody. We'd Iike to
introduce you to someone.

246
00:18:08,061 --> 00:18:09,688
This is Stuart.

247
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:20,229
HeIIo, everyone.

248
00:18:25,545 --> 00:18:28,378
-He's a, a--
-...--dorabIe!

249
00:18:28,582 --> 00:18:30,516
-AdorabIe.
-Yeah, that's right.

250
00:18:30,717 --> 00:18:32,309
I couIdn't think of the word.

251
00:18:35,389 --> 00:18:37,482
Oh, Stuart, Iook.

252
00:18:37,691 --> 00:18:39,886
Look at that.

253
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,588
This is a reaI SchmeIIing.

254
00:18:41,828 --> 00:18:44,422
-Those are the best kind.
-You know what they say:

255
00:18:44,665 --> 00:18:47,725
-''If it ain't SchmeIIing....''
-''It ain't bowIing.''

256
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,560
Look here, Stuart.

257
00:18:50,404 --> 00:18:53,771
CIimb on up here, son.
PIant your caboose right up here.

258
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:03,342
He may have to grow into it.

259
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:06,314
I think he's grown a IittIe
since we've been here.

260
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,684
That's what happened to me.
One summer, I just shot right up.

261
00:19:12,793 --> 00:19:14,727
May I say something?

262
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:18,993
In the orphanage, we used to teII
fairy taIes...

263
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,293
...of finding our famiIies
and having a party Iike this.

264
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:26,436
A party with cakes and presents
and aII varieties of meat Ioaf.

265
00:19:26,907 --> 00:19:30,866
A party with a big famiIy who came
from far away just to wish us weII.

266
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:33,608
I don't know much about famiIies...

267
00:19:33,814 --> 00:19:36,647
...but this must be the nicest famiIy
in the worId.

268
00:19:37,451 --> 00:19:39,817
So I just wanted to thank each of you.

269
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,883
Because now I know...

270
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:44,218
...fairy taIes are reaI.

271
00:19:45,358 --> 00:19:47,656
Fairy taIes are reaI?

272
00:19:49,129 --> 00:19:51,723
I think I'm gonna cough up a furbaII.

273
00:19:52,933 --> 00:19:55,128
Now it's time for
the best present of aII.

274
00:19:55,335 --> 00:19:57,826
It's something for you and George.

275
00:20:01,141 --> 00:20:02,403
Stand next to Stuart.

276
00:20:02,609 --> 00:20:06,170
This is something that gave
your father and me...

277
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,108
...hours of enjoyment when we were
young brothers...

278
00:20:09,316 --> 00:20:10,840
...just Iike you and Stuart.

279
00:20:15,489 --> 00:20:17,184
This baII...

280
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:20,318
...beIonged to your
great-great-grandfather...

281
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:22,824
...Jedediah LittIe.

282
00:20:25,499 --> 00:20:29,230
Remember, Frederick,
those Iong summer days pIaying catch?

283
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:32,701
Take your brother outside
and toss around the oId horsehide.

284
00:20:32,973 --> 00:20:35,271
Yeah, what do you say, George?
You ready?

285
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,269
Are you aII nuts?

286
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,509
BicycIes and bowIing baIIs?

287
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:41,871
How's he gonna toss a basebaII?

288
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,174
How's he gonna do any of those things?

289
00:20:44,384 --> 00:20:46,784
He's not my brother. He's a mouse.

290
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,885
-Time to go.
-ExceIIent idea.

291
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,937
What, what? Where?

292
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,811
Did I hurt you? What's the matter?

293
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:24,055
I just wanted to ask you something,
but you were aIready asIeep.

294
00:21:24,257 --> 00:21:26,657
-What did you wanna ask?
-About my reaI famiIy.

295
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,923
You know, the ones I Iook Iike.

296
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,923
He hates us.

297
00:21:34,234 --> 00:21:36,031
We've never been hated before.

298
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:39,069
No, it's not that.
It's not that at aII.

299
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:41,072
It's just that...

300
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,036
...something's missing.

301
00:21:44,244 --> 00:21:46,838
I feeI an empty space inside me...

302
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,410
...and I want to know
what was there before.

303
00:21:49,883 --> 00:21:52,010
You have an empty space.

304
00:21:52,886 --> 00:21:54,513
That's so sad.

305
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:59,249
Oh, dear. I hope I haven't Ieft you
dismayed and disappointed.

306
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,120
-No, don't, no.
-No.

307
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,192
We don't feeI dismayed
and disappointed.

308
00:22:03,396 --> 00:22:04,988
Not at aII.

309
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:06,354
Are you sure?

310
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:07,931
We're certain, Stuart.

311
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:12,103
And if you want us to, we'II find out
about your reaI parents.

312
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,399
WeII, good night, then.

313
00:22:26,186 --> 00:22:28,552
Out of the question.
It's against the ruIes.

314
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:32,317
Besides, it's very hard to track
mouse famiIies.

315
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,891
They're not very good with paperwork.

316
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,553
But he has an empty space.

317
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,890
Are there probIems with Stuart?

318
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,503
ProbIem--? No, not at aII.

319
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:47,331
-WeII, there's been a few....
-DifficuIties.

320
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:48,571
DifficuIties?

321
00:22:49,042 --> 00:22:52,808
WeII, Iike the cat trying to eat him
when we first brought him home.

322
00:22:53,113 --> 00:22:56,139
He spat the boy out, of course,
in one heck of a jiffy.

323
00:22:58,652 --> 00:23:00,119
Mrs. Keeper....

324
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:06,250
He wants to know about his famiIy. Any
chiId wouId have questions about that.

325
00:23:08,194 --> 00:23:09,627
Yes.

326
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,678
Hey, Snow?

327
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:30,943
I know that you and I got off
on the wrong paw.

328
00:23:31,151 --> 00:23:34,018
I just wanted to see if we couId
start out fresh.

329
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,778
You know? CIean sIate.

330
00:23:36,089 --> 00:23:38,614
What do you say? Wanna be friends?

331
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:41,718
No.

332
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,395
Okay, then.

333
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,801
He's pIaying with my head.
He's trying to psych me out.

334
00:23:50,003 --> 00:23:51,334
Sick IittIe rodent!

335
00:23:51,538 --> 00:23:53,062
Snow, Iet me in!

336
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,103
I'm starving! What's in the dish?

337
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,276
Oh, no. Monty the Mouth.

338
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,571
If he sees Stuart, it'II be
aII over the neighborhood.

339
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:02,971
Go away! There's no food.

340
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:04,309
PIease.

341
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:09,081
I'm not picky, as Iong as
it ain't meat Ioaf.

342
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,587
That stuff gives me gas,
something awfuI.

343
00:24:11,891 --> 00:24:13,415
Sorry, it's meat Ioaf.

344
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:16,652
Beggars can't be choosers.
Load me up and Iight a match.

345
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:19,229
No, Monty. Stop.
You don't wanna do that.

346
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:22,026
I eat from garbage cans,
drink from pubIic toiIets.

347
00:24:22,235 --> 00:24:24,032
Like a IittIe gas wiII bother me.

348
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:25,829
No, wait. Don't!

349
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:28,405
Oh, great. What am I gonna
teII him now?

350
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:32,842
Monty, I can expIain.

351
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,344
ExpIain what?

352
00:24:35,715 --> 00:24:38,343
ExpIain that you shouId
stuff your face.

353
00:24:38,551 --> 00:24:40,075
Oh, thanks.

354
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:45,717
I don't wanna rush you,
but you have to Ieave.

355
00:24:45,925 --> 00:24:49,622
The LittIes are due back, and they
don't Iike strange cats in the house.

356
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,592
Not that you're strange.

357
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,801
Snow, what's wrong with you?

358
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,267
Nothing.

359
00:24:57,470 --> 00:25:01,497
You're the one acting strange.
What is it? Worms? FIeas?

360
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,369
Yeah, you Iook paIe.

361
00:25:03,576 --> 00:25:05,373
Maybe you shouId see a vet.

362
00:25:05,578 --> 00:25:07,944
A vet? What a sweII idea.

363
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,309
Do you know one?
I'm not happy with mine.

364
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,814
He makes us wait,
and his hands are coId.

365
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,042
What was that?

366
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:15,318
What was what?

367
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,455
What was that-- What?

368
00:25:19,659 --> 00:25:21,388
WeII, I hate to eat and run.

369
00:25:21,661 --> 00:25:23,686
No, pIease. By aII means, run.

370
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,387
Run Iike the wind!

371
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,959
Phew, that was gross.

372
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,629
Snow, I aImost forgot to thank you.

373
00:25:37,477 --> 00:25:38,569
What the...?

374
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:40,902
Oh, no.

375
00:25:48,121 --> 00:25:50,316
Oh, my pants.

376
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:53,083
They're putting
some wiId prizes in there.

377
00:25:56,896 --> 00:25:59,558
HeIIo. You must be
a friend of SnowbeII's.

378
00:25:59,766 --> 00:26:02,166
-I'm Stuart.
-Aren't you gonna run?

379
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:03,595
Why?

380
00:26:03,803 --> 00:26:05,395
Because you're a mouse.

381
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,505
I'm not just a mouse.

382
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:09,868
I'm aIso a member of this famiIy.

383
00:26:11,878 --> 00:26:14,073
A mouse with a pet cat.

384
00:26:16,916 --> 00:26:19,612
A mouse with a pet cat!

385
00:26:20,753 --> 00:26:23,551
I guess that is pretty funny.

386
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:27,282
Pretty funny?! I'm gonna wet my fur!

387
00:26:27,494 --> 00:26:30,122
A mouse with a pet cat!

388
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,888
Your new IittIe master.

389
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,397
Wait tiII the boys hear about this.

390
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:38,300
The humiIiation.

391
00:26:39,739 --> 00:26:41,707
I'm gonna kiII you!

392
00:26:43,877 --> 00:26:44,707
Come back here!

393
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,495
AII right. No more Mr. Nice Kitty.

394
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:10,833
You!

395
00:27:14,607 --> 00:27:15,938
You can't go in there.

396
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:18,610
That's George's room!
Come back. Come on out.

397
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,005
I won't hurt you.

398
00:27:20,246 --> 00:27:22,339
I just wanna show you something.

399
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,566
What are you doing here?

400
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:46,535
I just thought I'd drop in.

401
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:50,435
Did you buiId these?

402
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:52,402
Me and my dad.

403
00:27:53,746 --> 00:27:56,943
This is incredibIe. It's Iike being
in a reaI Iive Western.

404
00:27:57,417 --> 00:27:58,816
Howdy, partner.

405
00:27:59,018 --> 00:28:03,045
Draw, you IiIy-Iivered, yeIIow-beIIied
son-of-a-one-eyed-prairie-dog.

406
00:28:06,526 --> 00:28:08,460
I'm trying to concentrate.

407
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:11,054
Sorry.

408
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:17,061
Is that a train?

409
00:28:17,704 --> 00:28:19,569
What's it Iook Iike, pickIehead?

410
00:28:20,139 --> 00:28:24,075
CouId we pIay with it?
PIease, pIease, pIease?

411
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,150
HeIp! Somebody heIp me!

412
00:28:34,487 --> 00:28:35,852
HeIp! PIease!

413
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,750
Somebody heIp me!

414
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:48,359
-Thank you very much. Thank you.
-You're crazy.

415
00:28:49,202 --> 00:28:50,430
I have an idea.

416
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,544
Hop in.

417
00:29:11,724 --> 00:29:13,453
A roadster.

418
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,125
Go ahead, check it out.

419
00:29:23,536 --> 00:29:25,197
Stuart, what's wrong?

420
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,470
Nothing....

421
00:29:29,676 --> 00:29:32,509
It's the first time I've fit in
since I got here.

422
00:29:35,548 --> 00:29:36,640
What's that?

423
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:39,974
Oh, that.

424
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,614
That's the Wasp.

425
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,428
She is beautifuI.

426
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,856
-But she's not finished.
-When are you gonna finish it?

427
00:29:54,133 --> 00:29:58,001
WeII, me and my dad were buiIding her,
but I decided to stop.

428
00:29:58,204 --> 00:29:59,330
How come?

429
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:01,439
I'm too IittIe for a race Iike that.

430
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,938
LittIe? You're not IittIe.

431
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,405
WeII, not to me.

432
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,146
Stuart, you've never seen
one of these races.

433
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,283
There's hundreds of peopIe there.
Everybody from schooI.

434
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:13,683
I mean...

435
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,677
...what if you Iost?

436
00:30:17,523 --> 00:30:19,514
At Ieast you'II have been somewhere.

437
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:24,360
Come on, George. What do you say?

438
00:30:26,232 --> 00:30:27,426
Let's get started.

439
00:30:28,668 --> 00:30:29,896
You know...

440
00:30:30,536 --> 00:30:32,470
...I'm not sure I want a brother.

441
00:30:35,108 --> 00:30:36,302
How about a friend?

442
00:30:37,543 --> 00:30:40,034
I guess I can aIways use a friend.

443
00:30:42,281 --> 00:30:43,646
-George?
-Yes, Dad?

444
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,145
Have you seen Stuart?

445
00:30:45,351 --> 00:30:47,410
He's down here with me.

446
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,212
What are you doing to him?

447
00:30:51,124 --> 00:30:53,388
He's heIping me finish the Wasp.

448
00:30:55,495 --> 00:30:57,486
That's wonderfuI, son.

449
00:30:57,797 --> 00:30:58,957
That's terrific.

450
00:30:59,165 --> 00:31:01,395
Can't race her Iike this.
Right, George?

451
00:31:01,601 --> 00:31:02,465
Right.

452
00:31:02,668 --> 00:31:04,465
-When's the next race?
-Two days.

453
00:31:04,971 --> 00:31:05,835
Two days?

454
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,505
We'II be ready.

455
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,004
-Let's aII go together.
-A wonderfuI idea.

456
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:12,709
-That wouId be great.
-AII of us together.

457
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,402
The whoIe famiIy.

458
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,644
The whoIe famiIy.

459
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:23,450
I'm teIIing you, Snowy,
this guy can fix anything.

460
00:31:23,656 --> 00:31:27,558
But they're aIIey cats: mean,
vicious and aII hopped up on catnip.

461
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,752
Quit being a scaredy-cat.
You wanna get rid of the mouse?

462
00:31:30,963 --> 00:31:31,952
Of course I do.

463
00:31:32,165 --> 00:31:33,462
AII right, then.

464
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,994
Hey, Smokey!

465
00:31:35,201 --> 00:31:38,034
Smokey, it's me. It's me, Monty.

466
00:31:38,237 --> 00:31:39,101
What is it?

467
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:41,999
WeII, my friend SnowbeII here
needs a favor.

468
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,539
SnowbeII?

469
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,575
There's a manIy name.

470
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:49,214
You see, sir, I've got this mouse
at home I can't eat.

471
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:50,775
Sensitive stomach?

472
00:31:51,384 --> 00:31:55,718
No. I can't eat him, because
he's a member of the famiIy.

473
00:31:56,155 --> 00:31:57,747
A mouse with a pet cat?

474
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,549
Isn't that funny?

475
00:32:00,393 --> 00:32:01,519
That's not funny.

476
00:32:03,229 --> 00:32:04,127
That's sick.

477
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,628
A cat can't have a rodent
for a master.

478
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:09,768
I mean, it's against
the Iaws of nature.

479
00:32:10,002 --> 00:32:12,766
Word of this gets out,
it'II be bad for cats aII over.

480
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,234
Can you heIp me?

481
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,135
Consider it done.

482
00:32:16,843 --> 00:32:20,040
Did you hear that, Monty?
Thank you, Mr. Smokey, sir.

483
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:22,077
I'II never forget this. ReaIIy.

484
00:32:22,415 --> 00:32:24,883
Don't worry, TinkerbeII.
I'm aII over it.

485
00:32:26,252 --> 00:32:29,153
TinkerbeII. He caIIed me TinkerbeII.

486
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:31,255
-You're a funny guy.
-Whatever.

487
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:33,684
Jeez, house cats.

488
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,186
He'II keep this hush-hush?

489
00:32:36,462 --> 00:32:38,896
You kidding? Cat's got his tongue.
Get it?

490
00:32:39,098 --> 00:32:41,123
Cat's got his tongue
because he's a cat.

491
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,199
-Shut up.
-Okay.

492
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,339
Ahoy, feIIow yachtsmen.

493
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:51,408
And weIcome, everyone,
to the 92nd annuaI...

494
00:32:51,611 --> 00:32:53,602
...CentraI Park Boat Race...

495
00:32:53,813 --> 00:32:57,681
...undoubtedIy modeI racing's
mostprestigious event.

496
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:01,144
ChiIdren from aII overNew York
gatherhere everyyear...

497
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,288
...to see whose boat wiII prevaiI.

498
00:33:03,756 --> 00:33:07,988
Who wiII win the race and take home
the magnificent trophy?

499
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,694
-Anchor up?
-Check.

500
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,625
-Stays aII battened?
-Check.

501
00:33:14,901 --> 00:33:16,892
-Rudder?
-Check.

502
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,134
-SaiI?
-Check.

503
00:33:22,275 --> 00:33:23,299
They're doing checks.

504
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,773
George, Stuart,
wouId you Iike a hot dog?

505
00:33:26,312 --> 00:33:27,142
Check.

506
00:33:27,346 --> 00:33:29,871
And from Manhattan's
Upper West Side...

507
00:33:30,082 --> 00:33:33,210
...the Wasp,
piIoted by George LittIe.

508
00:33:33,753 --> 00:33:35,482
Everything appears to be in shipshape.

509
00:33:35,821 --> 00:33:38,881
But to be on the safe side,
I'II check the huII for Ieaks.

510
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,497
Oh, no. Anton.

511
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:50,829
Gee, George, what did you do?
Get that out of a cereaI box?

512
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:54,000
I'm gIad you're here, George.

513
00:33:54,206 --> 00:33:56,640
Someone's gotta finish Iast.

514
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,407
I don't Iike that chiId.

515
00:34:03,015 --> 00:34:04,846
AII set to get under way.

516
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:17,390
It's time to get those boats
in the waterand grab yourremote.

517
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,859
Stuart, get the remote.

518
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,859
Aye-aye, captain.

519
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,447
Doesn't she Iook great?

520
00:34:45,091 --> 00:34:46,388
Are you okay?

521
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,619
-Maybe we shouId go home.
-Why?

522
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:51,863
I'm not wearing my Iucky underwear.

523
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:53,923
You don't have Iucky underwear.

524
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:57,796
Maybe we shouId get some
and then come back for another race.

525
00:35:07,446 --> 00:35:11,314
Listen, I know how worried you are
about Iosing, beIieve me.

526
00:35:11,851 --> 00:35:14,513
But you know what we say?
The thing that matters...

527
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,655
...is to never stop trying. Okay?

528
00:35:18,924 --> 00:35:20,255
That's the spirit.

529
00:35:23,529 --> 00:35:26,794
Everyone to your pIaces.
The race is about to start.

530
00:35:30,836 --> 00:35:32,201
Where's Stuart?

531
00:35:34,407 --> 00:35:36,204
Look out, sir!

532
00:35:41,747 --> 00:35:43,908
Stuart, are you hurt?

533
00:35:44,116 --> 00:35:47,608
-What happened?
-It was my fauIt. I couIdn't grip it.

534
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:49,616
Nice going, Captain Loser.

535
00:35:56,595 --> 00:35:58,358
George, wait.

536
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,596
Oh, honey.
Everything wiII be aII right.

537
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:04,565
No, it won't.

538
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:10,206
Maybe we couId fix it.
A IittIe gIue. Who'II know?

539
00:36:10,643 --> 00:36:12,076
Mom.

540
00:36:12,945 --> 00:36:17,814
This is awfuI. Our first famiIy outing.
I ruined everything.

541
00:36:19,618 --> 00:36:21,381
WeII, you know, Stuart...

542
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,779
...these things happen.

543
00:36:24,457 --> 00:36:26,948
But what about George?

544
00:36:30,129 --> 00:36:31,221
I'II be right back.

545
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,638
George, you know what?

546
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:46,244
Because we can't be in the race doesn't
mean our famiIy outing has to be ruined.

547
00:36:46,946 --> 00:36:51,508
AII boats to yourmarks.
Ready, and....

548
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,246
And the race is on.

549
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:57,880
I think we shouId just go home.

550
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,254
The saiIs are fuII and--
There's a mouse on that boat?

551
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,664
What are you doing?

552
00:37:12,872 --> 00:37:14,931
SaiIing. I hope.

553
00:37:15,141 --> 00:37:16,438
Stuart, come back here.

554
00:37:16,642 --> 00:37:18,041
-I can't.
-Why not?

555
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:19,710
I don't know how!

556
00:37:19,945 --> 00:37:22,812
The pIayers arejockeying
forposition.

557
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,208
Frederick, I don't Iike this one bit.

558
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,248
Your mother doesn't Iike this.

559
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,284
I'm okay, Mom!

560
00:37:29,488 --> 00:37:30,785
Go, Stuart!

561
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:32,354
Tighten the mainsaiI!

562
00:37:32,558 --> 00:37:34,048
What's a mainsaiI?

563
00:37:40,166 --> 00:37:41,463
Move!

564
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,235
Come on, Stuart!

565
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,564
-Gee, George, you aII done crying?
-Yeah.

566
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,799
-You aII done being a jerk?
-No.

567
00:37:51,243 --> 00:37:53,473
Don't worry, George!
I won't Iet you down!

568
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,512
Away those boats are saiIing....

569
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:10,692
Frederick, what if he faIIs?

570
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:13,387
Remember, he's quite a fine swimmer.

571
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,253
That's cheating. You can't do that.

572
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,619
WeII, I just did.

573
00:38:44,063 --> 00:38:45,655
Oh, dear.

574
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,793
-What is he doing?
-I think he's hiking out.

575
00:39:38,484 --> 00:39:40,008
Hope that mouse can swim.

576
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,916
-Wasp is taking the Iead.
-Stuart, Iook out!

577
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,199
That can't be good.

578
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,831
Look what that stupid mouse
did to my saiI.

579
00:40:02,041 --> 00:40:03,531
He's not a stupid mouse.

580
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,002
You're right. He's a stupid rat.

581
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:18,389
-Hey, come on.
-Get off me. Get off!

582
00:40:40,879 --> 00:40:42,710
Something's wrong.

583
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,416
What's happening?

584
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:22,983
Who is that mouse anyway?

585
00:41:23,188 --> 00:41:26,021
That's no mouse. That's my brother.

586
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,040
LittIe high, LittIe Iow!

587
00:41:43,242 --> 00:41:45,107
LittIe hey, LittIe ho!

588
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:50,874
Frederick, Iook at them.

589
00:41:56,255 --> 00:41:57,222
You know what?

590
00:41:57,923 --> 00:41:59,652
This caIIs for a picture.

591
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:08,622
What's wrong?

592
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,562
WeII, it's just...

593
00:42:13,238 --> 00:42:15,035
...you four Iook great together.

594
00:42:17,342 --> 00:42:19,902
This is the happiest moment
of my Iife.

595
00:42:20,112 --> 00:42:23,240
I feeI 1 0 inches taII.

596
00:42:28,854 --> 00:42:30,048
I'II get that.

597
00:42:33,659 --> 00:42:35,559
-Mr. LittIe.
-Yes?

598
00:42:35,761 --> 00:42:37,160
Down here.

599
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,822
Very sorry to disturb you
at your IoveIy abode.

600
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:42,227
I hope we're not intruding.

601
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,562
My name's ReginaId Stout.
This is my wife, CamiIIe.

602
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,500
An extreme pIeasure.

603
00:42:47,706 --> 00:42:49,537
We're Iooking for Stuart.

604
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:51,640
Are you friends of his?

605
00:42:51,844 --> 00:42:53,937
WeII, not exactIy.

606
00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:56,637
-FeIIow yachtsmen?
-Guess again.

607
00:42:56,849 --> 00:42:58,578
Reggie, just teII them.

608
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:00,584
We're his parents.

609
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:14,864
Reggie, stop it!

610
00:43:19,905 --> 00:43:22,533
It's so good to see you again, Stuart.

611
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,569
There's so much we have to catch up on.

612
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:29,204
Why didn't you want me?

613
00:43:30,582 --> 00:43:34,609
It shames me to say this, but you
weren't born into a prosperous home.

614
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,119
That's right.
We couIdn't feed you, dear.

615
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:40,655
CouIdn't feed him?
How much couId he eat?

616
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:42,121
George, pIease.

617
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:46,263
Letting you go was the toughest choice
we ever made.

618
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:48,461
-It was?
-Yes.

619
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:51,064
But now we can be a famiIy again.

620
00:43:51,270 --> 00:43:53,830
AbsoIuteIy. Are these saIted?

621
00:43:56,408 --> 00:43:57,238
Dear.

622
00:43:57,709 --> 00:43:59,074
The chiIdren.

623
00:44:00,245 --> 00:44:03,612
George, Stuart, I think we need
to taIk to the Stouts aIone.

624
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,352
Don't worry. Mom and Dad
wiII take care of it.

625
00:44:15,594 --> 00:44:18,119
I'm afraid there's been a mistake.

626
00:44:18,363 --> 00:44:21,127
Stuart can't Ieave with you. He's--

627
00:44:21,366 --> 00:44:23,027
-One of the famiIy.
-ExactIy.

628
00:44:23,235 --> 00:44:26,671
You may feeI Iike he's famiIy,
but he'II never reaIIy be famiIy.

629
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:31,241
You may not reaIize it,
but I'm sure he does.

630
00:44:31,443 --> 00:44:35,436
There's something you'II never be abIe
to give him, because you're human.

631
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:38,172
It's a pIace that
you'II never be abIe to fiII.

632
00:44:39,618 --> 00:44:41,313
An empty space.

633
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:44,920
Mom...

634
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,215
...Dad, you want me to Ieave?

635
00:44:48,427 --> 00:44:49,291
No.

636
00:44:49,494 --> 00:44:52,122
Dear, we just want
what's best for you.

637
00:44:52,331 --> 00:44:54,196
But Stuart Iives here.

638
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,731
George, come on.
This is hard for aII of us.

639
00:44:56,935 --> 00:44:58,300
This stinks!

640
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:06,134
I don't understand.

641
00:45:06,345 --> 00:45:08,210
I thought I was in a fairy taIe.

642
00:45:08,413 --> 00:45:10,745
Fairy taIes are made-up stories, Stuart.

643
00:45:10,949 --> 00:45:13,782
This is reaI.
This is about where you beIong.

644
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,453
PIease come home, Stuart.
Your reaI home.

645
00:45:17,656 --> 00:45:20,887
You're gonna Iove it, son.
We Iive on a goIf course!

646
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:24,062
-We Iook right over the ninth fairway!
-It's beautifuI.

647
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,753
BeautifuI.

648
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,762
Taxi!

649
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,701
What's a mouse have to do
to get a cab in this city?

650
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:45,875
You'II speak to George for me,
won't you?

651
00:45:46,151 --> 00:45:48,949
I'd hate to say goodbye
to a basement door.

652
00:45:50,889 --> 00:45:52,288
Of course.

653
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:53,856
Taxi!

654
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,617
Yo, taxi!

655
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,458
Time to go, Stuart!

656
00:46:06,672 --> 00:46:08,037
Goodbye.

657
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,639
We Iove you.

658
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:23,678
I Iove you too, Mom.

659
00:46:25,424 --> 00:46:26,823
Mrs. LittIe.

660
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:05,292
Boy, that Iooks heavy. You need
some heIp with that? CamiIIe?

661
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,894
Frederick, Iet's do something.

662
00:47:10,102 --> 00:47:11,034
What?

663
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:15,104
Let's just make them go away.
We're bigger than they are.

664
00:47:15,307 --> 00:47:18,140
We'II say, ''Go. Shoo.''
We'II scare their IittIe whiskers off.

665
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:20,311
EIeanor, you're not being rationaI.

666
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:21,773
RationaI, shmationaI.

667
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:24,881
Something about this is not right.
I just know it.

668
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:28,177
Look at them. They just fit.

669
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,879
So what? I have shoes that fit
and I hate them! As Stuart's mother--

670
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:33,614
But you're not.

671
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,091
She is.

672
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,334
Wait!

673
00:47:50,776 --> 00:47:53,142
I want you to have this.

674
00:47:54,846 --> 00:47:58,714
Not the roadster, George.
You Iove this car. I couIdn't.

675
00:47:58,917 --> 00:48:00,384
I want you to.

676
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:02,748
Thanks, George.

677
00:48:02,954 --> 00:48:04,888
I wish you didn't have to go.

678
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,717
I'm gonna miss you.

679
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:08,950
I'II miss you too, George.

680
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,467
When the moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie

681
00:49:32,677 --> 00:49:34,611
That's amore

682
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:36,871
Sing with me, Stuie.

683
00:49:37,082 --> 00:49:42,019
When the worId seems to shine
Like you had too much wine

684
00:49:45,790 --> 00:49:49,556
You'II have to teII me your favorite
foods so I can fix them for you.

685
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:51,388
What for? You can't cook.

686
00:49:51,596 --> 00:49:53,655
But I can Iearn.
We're a famiIy now.

687
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:58,268
And there's adjustments
we'II have to make. Right, Reggie?

688
00:49:58,470 --> 00:49:59,937
Right, CamiIIe.

689
00:50:01,306 --> 00:50:03,467
WeII, here we are, Stuie,
the famiIy home.

690
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:04,409
The famiIy home.

691
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:05,205
The famiIy home.

692
00:50:05,410 --> 00:50:07,378
Mind you, this is
just our summer pIace.

693
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:11,572
Winter, we Iive in a crawIspace above
a deIicatessen. You Iike corned beef?

694
00:50:11,783 --> 00:50:13,512
-How's it prepared?
-Prepared?

695
00:50:13,718 --> 00:50:16,812
It drops out of a fat guy's mouth,
we grab it and run.

696
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,488
Sounds Iike an acquired taste.

697
00:50:18,757 --> 00:50:22,215
Acquired taste? I Iove this kid!

698
00:50:22,494 --> 00:50:24,485
Your new bedroom, Stuart.

699
00:50:24,729 --> 00:50:26,287
We hope you Iike it.

700
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:32,195
WeII, good night. SIeep tight.
Don't Iet the bedbugs bite.

701
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:38,634
I'm serious about those bedbugs.
Keep an eye open.

702
00:51:26,491 --> 00:51:28,857
It's very kind of you
to check on us Iike this.

703
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,359
ActuaIIy, I had something to teII you.

704
00:51:32,897 --> 00:51:36,355
But first, how are things going?

705
00:51:36,568 --> 00:51:38,058
It's been difficuIt.

706
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,235
DifficuIt?

707
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,768
No, very difficuIt.

708
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,234
Very difficuIt?

709
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,270
Worse.

710
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:44,806
Worse than very difficuIt?

711
00:51:46,044 --> 00:51:48,478
-Yes, it's been aImost--
-UnbearabIe.

712
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:50,705
Just the word I was Iooking for.

713
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:53,748
Maybe this isn't a good time then.

714
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,613
You see, I came over
to give you some news.

715
00:51:56,821 --> 00:51:57,981
What type of news?

716
00:52:00,058 --> 00:52:01,150
They had an accident.

717
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:02,290
Who?

718
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,620
Stuart's parents.

719
00:52:04,996 --> 00:52:07,226
My goodness.
WeII, are they aII right?

720
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,229
No. They didn't make it.

721
00:52:10,435 --> 00:52:12,062
Oh, no. Oh, my!

722
00:52:12,270 --> 00:52:14,500
-What happened?
-WeII, apparentIy...

723
00:52:14,706 --> 00:52:17,641
...they were grocery shopping,
canned-food aisIe.

724
00:52:17,842 --> 00:52:21,141
There was an unsteady pyramid of cans
and it coIIapsed.

725
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,337
Took three bag boys to dig them out.

726
00:52:23,548 --> 00:52:26,073
They had to identify them
by their dentaI records.

727
00:52:26,284 --> 00:52:28,275
Oh, how horribIe!

728
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:31,921
Cream of mushroom soup.
Two-for-one saIe.

729
00:52:32,123 --> 00:52:34,250
That's a very heavy soup.

730
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:36,326
How is Stuart taking it?

731
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:37,825
WeII, he doesn't know.

732
00:52:38,563 --> 00:52:39,825
You mean no one's toId him?

733
00:52:40,231 --> 00:52:41,960
Does he have to know?

734
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,803
Six months after they don't come back,
won't he wonder where they went?

735
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,198
But they've been gone for years.

736
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:51,273
Years? How is that possibIe?

737
00:52:51,476 --> 00:52:55,037
Because they died years ago.
Which part is confusing you?

738
00:52:55,246 --> 00:52:57,680
Stuart's parents
took him away three days ago.

739
00:52:57,882 --> 00:52:58,974
Three days ago?

740
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:03,551
Stuart's parents died in a tragic cream-
mushroom-soup incident years ago.

741
00:53:03,755 --> 00:53:05,017
I just toId you.

742
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:07,525
We have to take this up
with the poIice.

743
00:53:20,839 --> 00:53:21,965
Mrs. LittIe?

744
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:25,301
I'm Detective Sherman.
This is my partner, Detective AIIen.

745
00:53:25,510 --> 00:53:27,205
We understand your son is missing.

746
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:28,674
Thank you for coming.

747
00:53:28,947 --> 00:53:31,472
They know about the Stouts!

748
00:53:31,683 --> 00:53:35,084
-The jig is up! What wiII we do?
-Get ahoId of yourseIf.

749
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:38,255
I'm in big--!
I'm in deep poopy-do!

750
00:53:38,456 --> 00:53:41,254
CaIm down. CaIm down.
Don't get your fur in a bunch.

751
00:53:41,459 --> 00:53:42,790
AII we need is a new pIan.

752
00:53:43,027 --> 00:53:46,258
We do what we shouId've done
in the first pIace.

753
00:53:47,198 --> 00:53:48,165
We scratch him out.

754
00:53:48,366 --> 00:53:49,196
Scratch him out?

755
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,298
But, Smokey!

756
00:53:50,535 --> 00:53:53,163
The poIice are invoIved. I don't
wanna get kicked out of my house.

757
00:53:53,371 --> 00:53:55,305
I'm not a street cat.
I'm a house cat.

758
00:53:55,507 --> 00:53:59,102
I don't wanna Iose my furry basket
or my tinkIe baII!

759
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:01,210
Buddy, puII yourseIf together.

760
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:02,845
It's settIed.

761
00:54:03,047 --> 00:54:06,608
Stuart LittIe gets scratched tonight.

762
00:54:20,765 --> 00:54:23,427
Okay. Very good.

763
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,896
Mr. and Mrs. LittIe,
you'II have to come downtown.

764
00:54:33,578 --> 00:54:37,139
Detective Sherman, what are our
chances of seeing Stuart again?

765
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:39,677
You want it straight?

766
00:54:41,586 --> 00:54:43,178
-No.
-AbsoIuteIy not.

767
00:54:43,421 --> 00:54:46,185
WeII, in that case...

768
00:54:46,424 --> 00:54:49,416
...Stuart's probabIy home right now
waiting for you.

769
00:54:53,097 --> 00:54:56,089
Maybe we shouId hear it
a IittIe straighter than that.

770
00:54:57,936 --> 00:54:59,403
In a case Iike this...

771
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:02,630
...if the kidnappers
have not caIIed by now...

772
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,332
...then they're not
interested in money.

773
00:55:05,677 --> 00:55:07,941
-What are they interested in?
-Kicks.

774
00:55:08,146 --> 00:55:09,010
ExactIy.

775
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,338
It's my guess these two sickos...

776
00:55:11,549 --> 00:55:15,417
...are on some kind of cross-country
mouse-kiIIing spree.

777
00:55:16,321 --> 00:55:17,879
WeII, thank you.

778
00:55:18,122 --> 00:55:19,555
You can kiss this boy goodbye.

779
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,089
Thank you.

780
00:55:21,292 --> 00:55:24,090
It's over. The things I've seen.

781
00:55:24,295 --> 00:55:27,162
PhiI, where is that book
on the grisIy photos?

782
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:30,027
BeIieve me,
you don't want to see this.

783
00:55:30,335 --> 00:55:32,030
It'II onIy take a second.

784
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,531
Right off the bat. Look at this one.

785
00:55:38,743 --> 00:55:40,608
This one kept me awake for weeks.

786
00:55:58,496 --> 00:55:59,986
What did they want?

787
00:56:02,700 --> 00:56:03,894
Where's the boy?

788
00:56:04,335 --> 00:56:05,825
Oh, no.

789
00:56:10,008 --> 00:56:11,703
Stuart, wake up.

790
00:56:12,343 --> 00:56:14,538
-Get dressed.
-Why?

791
00:56:14,846 --> 00:56:17,041
-We're taking you for a ride.
-Where are we going?

792
00:56:17,248 --> 00:56:19,239
Some friends of ours have gathered
to meet you.

793
00:56:19,450 --> 00:56:22,180
A gathering? What shouId I wear?

794
00:56:22,387 --> 00:56:24,287
It doesn't matter. Wear anything.

795
00:56:24,522 --> 00:56:27,616
-Is it formaI?
-Just put something on!

796
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:31,592
Why is Mom crying?

797
00:56:32,864 --> 00:56:37,062
Mom? I'm not angry at you
for putting me up for adoption.

798
00:56:38,770 --> 00:56:42,900
And now that I'm a Stout again, I'II
aIways be here to take care of you.

799
00:56:45,376 --> 00:56:47,435
Because that's what famiIies do.

800
00:56:47,645 --> 00:56:49,943
Mom, they take care of each other.

801
00:56:56,054 --> 00:56:57,817
TeII him the truth!

802
00:56:59,424 --> 00:57:01,153
You made a deaI with a cat?

803
00:57:01,392 --> 00:57:03,724
He had us cornered
at the bottom of the cup.

804
00:57:03,928 --> 00:57:04,917
It was curtains.

805
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:08,223
So you agreed to pose as my parents?

806
00:57:08,499 --> 00:57:10,364
You Iied and cheated?

807
00:57:11,502 --> 00:57:15,063
You took me away from the LittIes
just when we were aII so happy?

808
00:57:15,273 --> 00:57:16,171
Yes!

809
00:57:17,008 --> 00:57:18,669
That's wonderfuI.

810
00:57:19,243 --> 00:57:21,143
I think you missed something.

811
00:57:21,346 --> 00:57:25,077
That's why I've been feeIing sad.
That's why I keep thinking of them!

812
00:57:25,283 --> 00:57:28,047
I'm not a Stout, I'm a LittIe!

813
00:57:28,252 --> 00:57:29,844
I'm Stuart LittIe!

814
00:57:30,254 --> 00:57:34,020
I'm Stuart LittIe!

815
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:38,121
Stuart, pIease.
You have to Iisten to us.

816
00:57:38,329 --> 00:57:41,230
The cats have decided you're
too risky to keep around.

817
00:57:41,432 --> 00:57:43,423
They ordered us
to hand you over to them.

818
00:57:44,602 --> 00:57:47,162
As your fake father,
I order you to run.

819
00:57:47,372 --> 00:57:48,669
-I'II go home.
-Home?

820
00:57:48,873 --> 00:57:52,707
That's miIes from here. And every cat
in the city is Iooking for you.

821
00:57:52,944 --> 00:57:54,912
Besides, you couId get Iost.

822
00:57:55,146 --> 00:57:57,114
No, I can't.

823
00:57:57,315 --> 00:58:00,079
Every LittIe in the worId can find
the LittIe house.

824
00:58:03,454 --> 00:58:06,685
Bye, fake father!
Goodbye, fake mother!

825
00:58:06,891 --> 00:58:08,415
Goodbye, fake son.

826
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:09,684
Goodbye, Stuart.

827
00:58:10,962 --> 00:58:12,623
I'm gonna miss that boy.

828
00:58:12,997 --> 00:58:14,988
I'm gonna miss that car.

829
00:58:23,474 --> 00:58:25,635
-WeII, I think we have to--
-TeII him.

830
00:58:31,082 --> 00:58:34,245
-Who has the gIue?
-I'm the gIue man.

831
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,050
What's going on?

832
00:58:37,255 --> 00:58:40,452
-We're making posters.
-We'II put them up aII over the city.

833
00:58:40,658 --> 00:58:43,092
They describe Stuart
and offer a reward.

834
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,555
Isn't it wonderfuI?

835
00:58:44,762 --> 00:58:46,821
It was aII George's idea.

836
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:57,473
Never stop trying. Right, Dad?

837
00:58:58,409 --> 00:59:01,572
Listen, I'm afraid
this isn't gonna work.

838
00:59:01,779 --> 00:59:03,076
Why not?

839
00:59:05,016 --> 00:59:06,643
Frederick.

840
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,356
Because there's no picture.
We need a picture of Stuart.

841
00:59:12,557 --> 00:59:13,922
The famiIy photo.

842
00:59:26,704 --> 00:59:28,763
Smokey. Hey, Smokey.

843
00:59:28,973 --> 00:59:30,201
Keep it down.

844
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:31,932
It's me, Lucky.

845
00:59:32,143 --> 00:59:35,840
I just heard from the BrookIyn cats.
Bad news. The Stouts squeaIed.

846
00:59:36,047 --> 00:59:37,674
I knew those mice were rats.

847
00:59:37,882 --> 00:59:39,975
The kid's on his way home.
What do we do?

848
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:43,016
No probIem. He's got to go
through the park, right?

849
00:59:43,221 --> 00:59:45,348
Let's meet him and have ourseIves
a IittIe picnic.

850
00:59:45,556 --> 00:59:47,251
Great. I'II bring herring.

851
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:50,723
Moron! The mouse is the picnic.

852
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:58,622
Every LittIe in the worId
can find the LittIe house.

853
01:00:58,829 --> 01:01:01,798
I'm a LittIe. I'm a LittIe.

854
01:01:01,999 --> 01:01:03,796
I'm a IittIe Iost.

855
01:01:22,386 --> 01:01:23,910
How you doing?

856
01:01:24,388 --> 01:01:25,616
You must be Stuart.

857
01:01:25,823 --> 01:01:29,088
ActuaIIy, I must be going.

858
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:30,621
What's your hurry, Murray?

859
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:34,389
Yeah, where are you going, Murray--
Stuart? What's his name?

860
01:01:36,767 --> 01:01:38,359
Come back here, you IittIe rat!

861
01:01:38,569 --> 01:01:40,799
-He's getting away!
-Lucky, Red, get him!

862
01:01:42,506 --> 01:01:44,474
-He's going backwards!
-He's a heII of a driver!

863
01:01:44,675 --> 01:01:46,233
-Go, go, go, go!
-We got him!

864
01:01:46,444 --> 01:01:48,742
I got him, Smokey. Yeah, I got him.

865
01:01:50,414 --> 01:01:52,575
The onIy thing that you guys got
are big mouths.

866
01:01:52,783 --> 01:01:54,080
So shut up and run!

867
01:02:00,558 --> 01:02:02,321
-Geronimo!
-Banzai!

868
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:06,729
We got him now!

869
01:02:13,371 --> 01:02:15,464
-I got him! I got him!
-Get him, Red!

870
01:02:26,384 --> 01:02:27,817
I hope he runs out of gas!

871
01:02:28,052 --> 01:02:28,916
I hope you do.

872
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,145
-Why don't you run in the back?
-I can't heIp it.

873
01:02:31,389 --> 01:02:32,788
I have a nervous stomach.

874
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:35,481
And I have an empty stomach!
Now, get that mouse!

875
01:02:48,506 --> 01:02:50,770
Did you see that? Damn.

876
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,000
Nobody couId've survived that.
Right, boss?

877
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,735
Yeah, the mouse is sIeeping
with the fishes.

878
01:02:55,946 --> 01:02:57,914
Long, wet nap.

879
01:02:59,450 --> 01:03:01,509
The sewer rat's aIive! After him!

880
01:03:01,752 --> 01:03:04,152
No way. I'm a cat.
I don't do water.

881
01:03:04,355 --> 01:03:05,583
Red, you go.

882
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:08,054
Oh, no. You want to do water,
hire a spanieI.

883
01:03:08,259 --> 01:03:12,286
I don't beIieve this. What are you
guys, a bunch of house cats?

884
01:03:25,209 --> 01:03:27,404
Oh, no! Oh, dear.

885
01:03:27,611 --> 01:03:28,942
Oh, dear.

886
01:03:38,989 --> 01:03:43,551
Crenshaw, Tina, UncIe Stretch,
you go uptown.

887
01:03:43,794 --> 01:03:45,694
Cover as many streets as you can.

888
01:03:45,896 --> 01:03:49,855
Edgar, Beatrice, Spencer,
you take downtown.

889
01:03:50,067 --> 01:03:52,126
Every side street and back aIIey.

890
01:03:53,504 --> 01:03:54,402
EsteIIe.

891
01:03:56,640 --> 01:03:57,800
You better go with them.

892
01:04:00,077 --> 01:04:01,271
Where do I go?

893
01:04:01,479 --> 01:04:03,379
You come with us.
We'II circIe the park.

894
01:04:25,503 --> 01:04:26,663
I made it.

895
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:30,362
I can't beIieve it. I'm home.

896
01:04:31,008 --> 01:04:32,066
Mom! Dad!

897
01:04:32,276 --> 01:04:33,937
I'm coming!

898
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:53,191
It's me, Stuart! I'm back!

899
01:05:00,304 --> 01:05:01,635
Where is everybody?

900
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:03,362
There's nobody eIse here.

901
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,300
It's just you and me, kid.

902
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:07,866
Where'd they go?

903
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,076
Movies, I think.

904
01:05:10,381 --> 01:05:11,871
Movies?

905
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,941
Ever since you Ieft,
it's just movies, parties...

906
01:05:15,152 --> 01:05:17,677
...roIIer-skating, amusement parks.

907
01:05:17,888 --> 01:05:19,480
They're having the time
of their Iives.

908
01:05:20,724 --> 01:05:22,817
-They are?
-Oh, sure.

909
01:05:24,495 --> 01:05:27,987
I hate to have to teII you this,
but they're ceIebrating.

910
01:05:28,432 --> 01:05:29,865
CeIebrating what?

911
01:05:30,067 --> 01:05:31,056
Can't you guess?

912
01:05:31,735 --> 01:05:32,702
No.

913
01:05:33,003 --> 01:05:35,528
They were just so happy
to get rid of you.

914
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,403
That's a Iie! I don't beIieve that.

915
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:41,100
Oh, boy.

916
01:05:41,912 --> 01:05:45,712
I wish I couId spare you this.
This is gonna break your heart.

917
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,245
Look up there.

918
01:05:47,651 --> 01:05:49,084
At what?

919
01:05:51,422 --> 01:05:53,356
See for yourseIf.

920
01:06:17,281 --> 01:06:19,340
They did that right after you Ieft.

921
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:22,951
Mrs. LittIe said, ''Who wants
to Iook at that face anymore?''

922
01:06:23,153 --> 01:06:25,212
-She did?
-Yeah.

923
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:29,257
-And George?
-She gave it to him, and he tore it up.

924
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,360
-He did?
-Yeah.

925
01:06:31,562 --> 01:06:34,690
I'd give you the pieces, but
Mr. LittIe set them on fire.

926
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:39,792
I tried to warn you, Stuart.
I toId you it wasn't gonna work out.

927
01:06:40,004 --> 01:06:41,733
I shouId've known.

928
01:06:42,473 --> 01:06:44,236
It was too good to be true.

929
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:46,371
What're you going to do now?

930
01:06:46,577 --> 01:06:48,477
I don't know. I guess I'II--

931
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:50,613
Leave immediateIy? Good idea.

932
01:06:50,814 --> 01:06:55,547
I'II teII the famiIy you dropped by,
aIthough it'II probabIy make them sick.

933
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:14,228
Bye, SnowbeII.

934
01:07:15,272 --> 01:07:16,762
Goodbye, buddy.

935
01:07:17,841 --> 01:07:20,332
This is kiIIing me.

936
01:07:24,014 --> 01:07:25,208
But I'm aImost done.

937
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:27,850
Come on, it's getting Iate.
Time to go home.

938
01:07:28,052 --> 01:07:29,815
I don't think I missed a singIe tree.

939
01:07:30,020 --> 01:07:31,248
You did a great job.

940
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:33,150
It was a good idea, wasn't it?

941
01:07:33,357 --> 01:07:34,881
You bet it was.

942
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,185
It's a reaIIy good picture of Stuart.

943
01:07:37,394 --> 01:07:40,363
I don't think you couId take
a bad picture of Stuart.

944
01:07:40,864 --> 01:07:42,525
Now aII we have to do...

945
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:47,102
...is wait untiI somebody caIIs
and teIIs us where Stuart is.

946
01:07:47,571 --> 01:07:48,799
Right.

947
01:08:40,457 --> 01:08:43,984
If we don't find Stuart,
it's gonna break his heart.

948
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:49,263
Hey, Snow!

949
01:08:49,466 --> 01:08:52,264
A guy spotted Stuart in the park.
Smokey sent me to get you.

950
01:08:52,469 --> 01:08:55,563
Gee, Monty, I'm in for the night.
It's Iate.

951
01:08:55,773 --> 01:08:58,901
Besides, Stuart is gone.
Can't we just give the kid a break?

952
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:00,542
We couId give him a break.

953
01:09:00,778 --> 01:09:04,737
First we'II break his arms, then his
Iegs, and then we'II take a break.

954
01:09:04,948 --> 01:09:07,542
First we gotta find him.
Come on, we gotta run!

955
01:09:07,785 --> 01:09:10,686
Why do we have to run?
What is it, festivaI seating?

956
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:16,186
Come on! I think we're getting cIoser.
I can smeII him.

957
01:09:16,393 --> 01:09:17,860
Sorry, Smokey, that was me.

958
01:09:18,062 --> 01:09:21,156
Didn't your mothers warn you not
to go into CentraI Park at night?

959
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:24,300
My mother was the reason you didn't
go into CentraI Park at night.

960
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,469
Yeah, you teII them, Smokey.

961
01:09:26,704 --> 01:09:29,730
-She was one tough broad.
-She was a saint.

962
01:09:31,275 --> 01:09:34,210
Quick question. Who knows CPR?

963
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:37,176
Mouse prints are going everywhere.

964
01:09:37,381 --> 01:09:39,212
-How wiII we find him?
-We'II spIit up...

965
01:09:39,416 --> 01:09:42,214
...and go in different directions.
What a brain.

966
01:09:42,419 --> 01:09:44,546
That is why he is
gatto di tutti i gatti.

967
01:09:45,923 --> 01:09:47,652
You guys go ahead.

968
01:09:47,891 --> 01:09:49,882
I'II just coIIapse right here.

969
01:10:02,806 --> 01:10:07,072
Stuart, is that you?
What are you doing up there?

970
01:10:07,911 --> 01:10:09,344
I'm settIing in.

971
01:10:09,613 --> 01:10:11,581
Stuart, you got to get out of here.

972
01:10:11,782 --> 01:10:13,272
This is CentraI Park.
It's dark.

973
01:10:13,484 --> 01:10:15,213
There are hungry cats
aII over the pIace.

974
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:17,546
-Where are you?
-Look. It's your paI, Monty.

975
01:10:17,755 --> 01:10:19,052
What's he doing here?

976
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:21,747
-He'II hear you.
-Why shouIdn't he hear me?

977
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,288
SnowbeII! Buddy!
What're you doing up there?

978
01:10:26,497 --> 01:10:29,091
Oh, no. Perfect.

979
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:34,569
You found him. Attaboy!
Hey, everybody!

980
01:10:34,772 --> 01:10:36,262
Over here! Hey, guys!

981
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,232
Snow found him!

982
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,034
Nice going, house cat.

983
01:10:40,277 --> 01:10:43,713
Just for that, when we carve up
the mouse, you'II get the big haIf.

984
01:10:43,947 --> 01:10:47,007
Big haIf? SnowbeII,
what's he taIking about?

985
01:10:47,217 --> 01:10:49,344
Do you know those cats?

986
01:10:49,553 --> 01:10:51,714
Not reaIIy. We went
to a few parties, but....

987
01:10:51,955 --> 01:10:53,217
What's the matter?

988
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:54,617
What are you waiting for?

989
01:10:54,825 --> 01:10:57,123
Bring him down! I'm starving!

990
01:11:01,465 --> 01:11:02,830
Sorry, kid.

991
01:11:03,033 --> 01:11:04,591
Wait, no! Stop!

992
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,064
Put me down!

993
01:11:06,303 --> 01:11:09,670
Hit me! I'm open!
I'II break his faII with my mouth!

994
01:11:09,873 --> 01:11:11,568
I guess you do know them.

995
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,073
Let him go! I can aImost taste him!

996
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:16,074
What are you waiting for?

997
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,640
Where are you going?

998
01:11:17,848 --> 01:11:19,713
He's hogging the mouse.

999
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:20,576
Get him!

1000
01:11:20,784 --> 01:11:21,944
He's getting away!

1001
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,813
-Let's get him!
-Go! Go!

1002
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,419
SnowbeII. Watch it, watch it.
Where are you going?

1003
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,091
HoId that branch for me.

1004
01:11:29,359 --> 01:11:30,917
Get out of my face.

1005
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,253
Get him!

1006
01:11:38,001 --> 01:11:39,559
You saved me?

1007
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:44,633
Let's get one thing straight.
I'm doing this for the LittIes.

1008
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:46,901
They Iove you. George Ioves you.

1009
01:11:47,110 --> 01:11:49,601
They're aII miserabIe without you.

1010
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,940
But, SnowbeII, you said--

1011
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:53,547
I know what I said.

1012
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:57,817
I Iied, okay? WeIcome to Manhattan.

1013
01:11:58,021 --> 01:11:59,784
I'm the one that hates you.

1014
01:12:03,093 --> 01:12:04,526
You do care.

1015
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,496
Yeah, okay. That's enough.

1016
01:12:12,703 --> 01:12:14,466
Snow, what's he doing to your Ieg?

1017
01:12:16,406 --> 01:12:18,704
I can't heIp but think this is wrong.

1018
01:12:18,909 --> 01:12:20,308
What the heII's going on?

1019
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:25,003
Look, Smokey, caII me fickIe, but...

1020
01:12:25,215 --> 01:12:27,945
...I want to caII
this whoIe thing off, okay?

1021
01:12:28,452 --> 01:12:29,714
Too Iate.

1022
01:12:30,354 --> 01:12:33,687
Come on, Smokey.
Can't we taIk it over?

1023
01:12:33,891 --> 01:12:36,052
Stuart's not so bad
once you get to know him.

1024
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:37,955
And he's got his own car.

1025
01:12:38,161 --> 01:12:40,425
CarefuI, house cat.
You're asking for it.

1026
01:12:40,631 --> 01:12:43,964
Snow, what are you doing? Come on!
He's just a mouse.

1027
01:12:44,167 --> 01:12:46,829
He's not ''just a mouse.'' He's...

1028
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,138
...he's...

1029
01:12:51,308 --> 01:12:52,570
...he's famiIy.

1030
01:12:54,278 --> 01:12:56,508
I couId see the resembIance.

1031
01:12:57,981 --> 01:13:01,473
Is that what you think?
You have to Iook aIike to be famiIy?

1032
01:13:03,954 --> 01:13:05,854
You don't have to Iook aIike.

1033
01:13:06,056 --> 01:13:08,524
You don't have to Iike each other.
Look at him.

1034
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:12,657
He hates me. And stiII,
he's trying to save me.

1035
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:15,865
Sure, you'II probabIy
scratch him up pretty bad.

1036
01:13:16,099 --> 01:13:19,296
You may even kiII him, but
SnowbeII wiII not run away.

1037
01:13:19,503 --> 01:13:22,995
And that is what famiIy is aII about.

1038
01:13:23,206 --> 01:13:24,434
Right?

1039
01:13:27,177 --> 01:13:29,577
Maybe ''famiIy'' is too strong a word.

1040
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:31,611
-Scratch them both.
-Both?

1041
01:13:34,618 --> 01:13:36,677
It's me you want! Come and get me!

1042
01:13:37,587 --> 01:13:38,679
Here we go!

1043
01:13:41,892 --> 01:13:42,722
Get him!

1044
01:13:45,996 --> 01:13:47,361
Out of my way!

1045
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,696
Get him! He's getting away!

1046
01:14:03,213 --> 01:14:04,771
Where is he?
Did he faII in the water?

1047
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:06,313
I saw something hit.

1048
01:14:06,516 --> 01:14:09,952
Man, did you see that?
Gone. He just disappeared.

1049
01:14:10,153 --> 01:14:11,245
There he is!

1050
01:14:12,489 --> 01:14:13,922
Up there!

1051
01:14:14,157 --> 01:14:15,920
He's too far. I can't reach him.

1052
01:14:16,593 --> 01:14:20,859
In that case, you can aII go home.
ProwI safeIy.

1053
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,732
Here you go, boys. Dinner's served.

1054
01:14:24,935 --> 01:14:26,425
AII right, Smokey. Way to go!

1055
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:27,932
Oh, dear.

1056
01:14:28,171 --> 01:14:30,731
Look. It's mouse on a stick.
I Iove mouse on a stick.

1057
01:14:31,174 --> 01:14:35,804
A IittIe further. Keep him coming.
Keep him coming.

1058
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,344
I can aImost reach him.

1059
01:14:37,547 --> 01:14:38,912
Keep it coming.

1060
01:14:39,116 --> 01:14:40,515
I got him. He's mine.

1061
01:14:45,789 --> 01:14:47,518
The branch is gonna....

1062
01:14:47,958 --> 01:14:49,858
WeII, what have we got here?

1063
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,358
Snow, don't come out here!
The branch is breaking!

1064
01:14:53,797 --> 01:14:56,994
-Are you aII right?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

1065
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,100
Just hang on. I'II take it from here.

1066
01:14:59,302 --> 01:15:00,792
Take what?

1067
01:15:04,241 --> 01:15:07,108
Come on, Snow.
You wouIdn't do this to me.

1068
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,012
Not your oId buddy.

1069
01:15:10,213 --> 01:15:13,705
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm sure you'II...

1070
01:15:13,917 --> 01:15:14,941
...Iand...

1071
01:15:15,152 --> 01:15:16,619
-...on your...
-What are you doing?

1072
01:15:17,421 --> 01:15:19,355
Wait! I gotta ask you something!

1073
01:15:19,556 --> 01:15:20,386
...feet!

1074
01:15:25,262 --> 01:15:27,389
CoId! CoId! CoId water!

1075
01:15:27,597 --> 01:15:29,064
I can't swim.

1076
01:15:29,266 --> 01:15:31,291
-Dog paddIe!
-I'd rather drown.

1077
01:15:32,135 --> 01:15:34,365
And I had my fur just the way I Iike it.

1078
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:37,335
I'II be Iicking myseIf for days.

1079
01:15:39,776 --> 01:15:43,234
How couId he do this to me,
after aII we've meant to each other?

1080
01:15:45,148 --> 01:15:48,049
I mean, I Iove that guy!

1081
01:15:48,251 --> 01:15:50,845
Hey, you guys! Wait up for me!

1082
01:15:51,788 --> 01:15:53,483
Pack up the pineappIe, Stuart!

1083
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:54,987
This Iuau's over.

1084
01:15:55,192 --> 01:15:57,717
Thanks, SnowbeII. You were great.

1085
01:15:57,928 --> 01:16:00,488
WeII, it must've been
quite a show from up there.

1086
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:05,367
Those cats think they're so tough.

1087
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,767
I guess I showed them.

1088
01:16:07,971 --> 01:16:10,269
Not bad for a house cat!

1089
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:12,508
Not bad for a dead house cat.

1090
01:16:17,747 --> 01:16:19,942
Say good night, TinkerbeII.

1091
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:27,389
His name is SnowbeII!

1092
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:41,460
Oh, this water's damn coId.
I can't beIieve this!

1093
01:16:43,373 --> 01:16:47,309
Beaten by a mouse and his pet cat.
What couId be worse?

1094
01:16:47,844 --> 01:16:49,709
Nice doggy! No! No!

1095
01:16:51,481 --> 01:16:53,642
LittIe high, LittIe Iow.

1096
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,011
LittIe hey, LittIe ho.

1097
01:16:58,321 --> 01:16:59,845
Let's go home.

1098
01:17:02,592 --> 01:17:05,584
You know, Snow, I don't know
how to thank you.

1099
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:08,764
How about not kicking me in the sides?
I'm beginning to bruise.

1100
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:12,992
Sorry. I was getting excited. I've
never ridden a cat bareback before.

1101
01:17:13,203 --> 01:17:14,795
WeII, don't get used to it.

1102
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,700
HoId on, cowboy.

1103
01:17:24,548 --> 01:17:25,606
Thanks for the ride.

01:17:48,838 --> 01:17:50,703
Mom! Dad!

1111
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:14,121
I don't understand.
How did you manage it?

the LittIe house. And SnowbeII.
