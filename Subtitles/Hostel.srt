-Amsterdam, motherfucker!
-Okay.

4
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,682
Come on, let's go.
Where are we going?

5
00:02:24,855 --> 00:02:26,846
Red-light district. Time for <i>sneepur</i>.

6
00:02:27,024 --> 00:02:29,618
Let's go to the coffee shop first,
then get some <i>sneepur</i>.

7
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:32,057
Hey, l think the Anne Frank
house is around here.

8
00:02:35,098 --> 00:02:36,895
Did we come to Europe
just to smoke pot?

9
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:38,591
l came all the way from Iceland.

10
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,363
-Yeah, what if we did?
-We did that every day in college.

11
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,699
Why not, like, you know,
check out a museum?

12
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:45,842
No, you're right.
We should go to a museum.

13
00:02:46,009 --> 00:02:47,271
How about the hemp museum?

14
00:02:51,715 --> 00:02:53,444
Oli proudly presents...

15
00:02:55,452 --> 00:02:57,113
...Isabella.

16
00:02:58,288 --> 00:02:59,550
She's cute.

17
00:02:59,723 --> 00:03:03,090
But we can't rail a girl
who's in a coma.

18
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,229
l think that's illegal
even in Amsterdam.

19
00:03:05,409 --> 00:03:08,597
-Hey, I’m just warming up, man.
-Fucking Oli.

20
00:03:08,765 --> 00:03:10,892
The Icelandic--
Oh, God, how are you?

21
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:14,868
You want to get stoned?

22
00:03:15,405 --> 00:03:17,896
-This will wake you up.
-<i>What the fuck?

23
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:24,640
This is good Amsterdam shit.

24
00:03:27,765 --> 00:03:30,165
That's the shit right there, dude.

25
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:32,034
Trust me.

26
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:38,136
Yeah.

27
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:40,277
-It's all good, bro.
-Yeah, dude, smoke it!

28
00:03:42,413 --> 00:03:44,847
-Dude, what happened?
-Any Dutch people in Amsterdam?

29
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:02,657
All right, this is my friend, Josh.

30
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,097
-Well, hello.
-Hi.

31
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:10,135
-Do you guys want another round?
-Yes, okay.

32
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:11,774
Yeah?

33
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:17,876
We will be right back.

34
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:22,443
-What are you doing?
-What?

35
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:26,783
Do you see a single other person
in here with a fucking fanny pack?

36
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:27,981
Wait. There's a guy.

37
00:04:28,158 --> 00:04:30,490
Why don't you go have
fanny-pack sex with him...

38
00:04:30,661 --> 00:04:33,221
...and jizz all over each other's
storage compartments?

39
00:04:33,397 --> 00:04:36,389
l can't put my passport in my pocket.
Lt chafes my thighs, bitch.

40
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,296
-All right?
-Yeah.

41
00:04:38,469 --> 00:04:39,629
Where's Oli?

42
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,739
He's fucking genius.

43
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:52,342
<i>Sneepur</i> alert, 3 o'clock.

44
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,747
-She smokes.
-Dude, it's Europe!

45
00:04:54,918 --> 00:04:58,285
Every fucking chick smokes.
Stop being a pussy.

46
00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:01,424
You are so easy sometimes.

47
00:05:01,792 --> 00:05:05,990
The power of the pack is yours.
I’m out of here.

48
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,060
I’m sorry.

49
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,469
Yeah, l--
No, l don't even speak Dutch.

50
00:05:17,641 --> 00:05:19,734
No, I’m sorry, l--

51
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:22,640
Get off me, you fucking
faggot-ass elf. Fuck off.

00:05:22,813 --> 00:05:24,405
-Hey, what the fuck?
-Hey. Hey.

53
00:05:24,581 --> 00:05:26,344
Come on, faggot.

54
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:32,347
-Fucker!
-Get your fucking hands off me.

55
00:05:32,523 --> 00:05:35,048
-I’m an American, l got rights.
-Get the fuck out.

56
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:38,524
-Your fucking club sucks ass, bro.
-Kiss my American ass, fucker.

57
00:05:38,695 --> 00:05:40,526
-Fuck you.
-Let's get out of here, bro.

58
00:05:40,697 --> 00:05:42,665
Hey, l don't know why
you guys are waiting.

59
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,996
It's a fucking fag fest in there.
Wall-to-wall fucking cock.

60
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,570
You need one of these
to get in, bro. Sorry.

61
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:50,229
That shit was classic, dude.

62
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:53,399
He was gonna throw down
with a 400-pound Dutchman.

63
00:05:53,577 --> 00:05:55,943
I’m fucking awesome!

64
00:05:56,713 --> 00:05:57,941
l don't fucking know what--

65
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,948
l thought you were a Jew, man.
This guy's a fucking Israeli!

66
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:02,676
You are fucking Israeli.

67
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,587
Oh, God, l hope bestiality
is legal in Amsterdam...

68
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,783
...because that girl's a fucking hog.
Look at that, man.

69
00:06:10,194 --> 00:06:12,287
Hey, guys,
l think she likes me, man.

70
00:06:12,463 --> 00:06:15,762
Oh, look at that.
Josh, my gift to you, man.

71
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:19,733
Thanks, but paying to do whatever
you want to someone isn't a turn-on.

72
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:23,270
How are you gonna get over your chick
if you don't bang some new pussy?

73
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,704
You can't go home
without getting some hot chick.

74
00:06:25,876 --> 00:06:27,901
l agree, but l shouldn't
have to pay for it.

75
00:06:28,078 --> 00:06:30,137
Hey, come on, I’m paying, man.

76
00:06:56,006 --> 00:06:57,564
Hey.

77
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:00,037
Are you okay?

78
00:07:01,245 --> 00:07:04,009
Hello? Hello?

79
00:07:09,153 --> 00:07:12,179
Hey, close the door.
You watch, you pay.

80
00:07:12,356 --> 00:07:14,051
Sorry. Jesus.

81
00:07:14,625 --> 00:07:16,388
You're up, slugger.

82
00:07:17,194 --> 00:07:20,857
Man, I’m fucking-- I’m tired, man.
l can, like, barely stand up.

83
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,022
Josh, you want
to be a fucking writer?

84
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,964
How about some life experience,
right there in that room.

85
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,104
-What do we have in here?
-Hey, you watch, you pay.

86
00:07:31,275 --> 00:07:33,709
l pay. l pay, man. Come on.

87
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,308
Hey.

88
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:46,615
Come, sit.

89
00:07:50,127 --> 00:07:52,857
Your friends are so funny.

90
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:55,395
Yeah.

91
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,928
You can wash over here, by sink.

92
00:08:14,851 --> 00:08:16,409
Lt was fine.

93
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:19,815
What do you mean? That bitch had
the best fucking tits in Amsterdam.

94
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:22,220
Lt was fine. Lt was whatever.

95
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,659
What was that?

96
00:08:28,832 --> 00:08:31,801
-It's fucking after curfew, man.
-Curfew? What are we, 1 3?

97
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:35,530
Let us the fuck in,
we're freezing our balls off.

98
00:08:35,706 --> 00:08:38,300
We paid to stay here.
They can't just, like, lock us out.

99
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:39,737
This is bullshit.

100
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,138
Hello?

101
00:08:41,311 --> 00:08:42,903
Open the fucking door.

102
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,910
-What did you tell him?
-He just told them to let us in.

103
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:55,850
-Shut up!
-Jesus.

104
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:58,790
Shut the fuck up,
you fucking Americans.

105
00:08:58,962 --> 00:09:00,793
Hey, l know what to do.

106
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:06,368
Shut up.

107
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:10,264
Hey, hey, guys. Up here.
Climb quickly.

108
00:09:10,807 --> 00:09:12,536
Come on.

109
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:13,867
Go. Go, go, go.

110
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,041
Oh, don't mind them.

111
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:27,078
They are so fucked up they don't
know what planet they are on.

112
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:31,953
-Thanks, bro.
-It's no problem.

113
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:35,121
Not everyone
want to kill Americans.

114
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,725
Paxton.

115
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:43,101
Alexei. But call me Alex.

116
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:47,869
What's up, Alex.
This is Josh and Oli.

117
00:09:48,312 --> 00:09:50,075
Guys, this is fucking awesome, man.

118
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:52,807
I’m the first in line for <i>sneepur</i>.

119
00:09:54,284 --> 00:09:56,878
Oh, that's Icelandic for ''clit.''

120
00:09:58,322 --> 00:10:01,189
Clitoris or clitoris,
however you wanna say that.

121
00:10:01,358 --> 00:10:02,416
Women have it.

122
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:06,619
It's, like, right near the labia.
Like, it hangs.

123
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:09,994
Oh, yeah.
Very good <i>sneepur</i> in Iceland.

124
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:12,567
-Yeah.
-Come on, guys, have a seat.

125
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,843
Where you travel to?

126
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:25,175
We started in Paris,
which is where we met this drifter.

127
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,941
Anyway, we went all over France...

128
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:30,052
...and then Switzerland, Belgium,
and now we're in Amsterdam.

129
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,711
Yeah, kind of over Amsterdam.
Way too many Americans.

130
00:10:32,889 --> 00:10:35,915
Yeah, but Oli's got a friend
with a flat in Barcelona...

131
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,290
...and he's supposed to hook us up
with some hot-ass <i>senoritas</i>.

132
00:10:39,796 --> 00:10:41,423
Looking for girls?

133
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:44,761
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

134
00:10:46,002 --> 00:10:48,368
So talk to Alex.

135
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,434
He open up the pussy
all over the Europe.

136
00:10:52,609 --> 00:10:53,769
l can help you.

137
00:10:54,311 --> 00:10:57,678
Oh, shit.
Alex is a pimp, apparently.

138
00:10:58,448 --> 00:11:00,973
Thanks, bro,
but l think we'll be okay.

139
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,618
-Yeah.
-Good.

140
00:11:08,692 --> 00:11:10,387
You looking for girls like this?

141
00:11:19,669 --> 00:11:22,638
These are fucking magnificent.

142
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,675
-Who the hell are these girls?
-You have to go east, my friend.

143
00:11:26,843 --> 00:11:28,902
This is where the best girls are.

144
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:30,410
The best.

145
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,411
How far east?

146
00:11:32,582 --> 00:11:35,517
You can go as far as Ukraine,
around Odessa.

147
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,648
These girls l met
at this one hostel in Slovakia...

148
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:41,415
...just outside Bratislava.

149
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,018
The girls there are so hot
you cannot believe it.

150
00:11:45,929 --> 00:11:48,830
And they love anyone foreign,
especially American.

151
00:11:49,232 --> 00:11:51,598
They hear your accent,
they fuck you.

152
00:11:51,768 --> 00:11:54,931
So wait, this place
is near Bratislava?

153
00:11:55,105 --> 00:11:56,197
Josh.

154
00:11:56,873 --> 00:11:59,171
You won't find this hostel
in any guidebook.

155
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:03,505
Barcelona, so many Americans.

156
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,807
But Slovakia? No one there.

157
00:12:05,982 --> 00:12:09,884
There is so much pussy, and because
of the war, there are no guys.

158
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,346
You go to this hostel,
you will have any girl you want.

159
00:12:13,523 --> 00:12:16,117
They go crazy for any foreigner.

160
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:18,056
You just...

161
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:21,192
...take them.

162
00:12:49,192 --> 00:12:50,989
Fuck, man.

163
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,027
Can't you keep your Viking ass
in your pants for, like, two seconds?

164
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,997
Hey, man, l shaved my ass
just for you.

165
00:12:59,169 --> 00:13:01,228
-Okay, all right.
-My Viking balls too.

166
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,837
Okay, stop.

167
00:13:14,784 --> 00:13:16,308
I’m sorry.

168
00:13:16,486 --> 00:13:18,010
My daughter.

169
00:13:18,188 --> 00:13:20,179
She miss her daddy,
and Daddy miss her.

170
00:13:20,357 --> 00:13:21,949
Yeah, no problem, dude, it's cool.

171
00:13:25,729 --> 00:13:27,822
-Saskia.
-Cute.

172
00:13:28,331 --> 00:13:31,960
-She's adorable.
-She's a little cutie, yeah.

173
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:36,205
This is Svanhildur, my daughter.

174
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,931
-Very pretty.
-She's 6.

175
00:13:38,575 --> 00:13:40,133
She's starting school this year.

176
00:13:40,844 --> 00:13:42,744
Wait, you have a daughter?

177
00:13:42,913 --> 00:13:45,746
Yeah, of course, my horse.
l was married for eight years.

178
00:13:47,217 --> 00:13:49,515
Okay. All right.

179
00:13:49,686 --> 00:13:52,450
-You are on vacation?
-Yeah, we're backpacking.

180
00:13:52,622 --> 00:13:54,089
Our next stop is Bratislava.

181
00:13:56,826 --> 00:13:59,727
-What?
-Slovakia.

182
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:03,533
You will like it.

183
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,132
Casino, girls.

184
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,331
You can pay to do anything.

185
00:14:11,508 --> 00:14:13,271
Anything.

186
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:17,303
-How are the girls?
-Very beautiful.

187
00:14:17,914 --> 00:14:20,815
They will love you.
Handsome American like you.

188
00:14:22,986 --> 00:14:26,478
Handsome devil. He is handsome.

189
00:14:27,357 --> 00:14:30,520
That's-- That's awkward.
That's awkward.

190
00:14:38,935 --> 00:14:41,062
That's awkward too.

191
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,899
-You need a fork there, chief?
-No, no, no.

192
00:14:46,076 --> 00:14:48,601
l prefer to use my hands.

193
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:51,174
l believe...

194
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:55,315
...people have
lost their relationship with food.

195
00:14:56,686 --> 00:14:58,051
They do not think:

196
00:14:58,221 --> 00:15:01,884
''This is something who gave its life
so l would not go hungry.''

197
00:15:02,626 --> 00:15:05,959
l like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

198
00:15:06,129 --> 00:15:07,528
l appreciate it more.

199
00:15:08,732 --> 00:15:10,165
Well, I’m vegetarian.

200
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:12,801
And l am a meat-eater.

201
00:15:12,969 --> 00:15:14,903
It's human nature.

202
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,034
Well, I’m human,
and it's not in my nature.

203
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,739
Tell me, what is your nature?

204
00:15:22,579 --> 00:15:25,013
Don't touch!
Don't fucking touch me!

205
00:15:25,482 --> 00:15:27,074
I’m sorry.

206
00:15:28,518 --> 00:15:29,951
Excuse me.

207
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:33,021
Fucking freak.

208
00:15:34,858 --> 00:15:35,916
Jesus.

209
00:15:39,729 --> 00:15:42,562
Edward Saladhands
just groped Josh.

210
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,465
Dude, you finally hooked up.
That's awesome.

211
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,068
Yeah, that's fucking hilarious.

212
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:55,932
Or we could visit some factories.

213
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,739
Should be cool.

214
00:16:58,908 --> 00:17:00,739
Ln this area...

215
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:05,438
...we make plastic for Slovakia.

216
00:17:07,517 --> 00:17:08,745
ls that so?

217
00:17:31,174 --> 00:17:32,903
Look at this.

218
00:18:16,586 --> 00:18:19,885
-Nice, eh?
-This is a fucking hostel?

219
00:18:21,024 --> 00:18:23,288
Holy shit.

220
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,334
You can have that, man.
I’m too scared.

221
00:18:36,472 --> 00:18:38,337
Hey, hey. The party has arrived.

222
00:18:39,676 --> 00:18:42,236
-You are saved from boredom.
-Let me guess.

223
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,848
You must be
the King of the Swing.

224
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:48,245
You made a reservation under
''King of the Swing?''

225
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,181
-Yeah, of course, my horse.
-I’m sorry.

226
00:18:50,353 --> 00:18:54,221
-He doesn't get out of his cage much.
-l can see that.

227
00:18:56,893 --> 00:18:58,690
Here are your keys.

228
00:18:58,962 --> 00:19:01,795
You leave your passports
at the desk.

229
00:19:05,668 --> 00:19:08,728
That was taken when l was like 1 3.
l was kind of husky.

230
00:19:08,905 --> 00:19:10,270
Not anymore, though, you know?

231
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,409
Do you have any private rooms?
We're probably gonna need them.

232
00:19:13,576 --> 00:19:17,740
The rooms are semiprivate,
so you will have roommates.

233
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:20,815
Roommates, huh? That's gay.

234
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,224
Sorry.

235
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,788
-Oh, my God.
-It's okay.

236
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:36,898
The room is yours.
We are going to the spa.

237
00:19:39,402 --> 00:19:41,233
You should come.

238
00:19:45,074 --> 00:19:46,837
Spa.

239
00:20:01,758 --> 00:20:03,623
Jugs.

240
00:20:07,297 --> 00:20:09,663
-Hey.
-Hello.

241
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:11,823
Oh, Jesus.

242
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,929
-Hi. Hey.
-Hi.

243
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:20,942
How you doing?

244
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,778
I’m so happy l shaved my balls.

245
00:20:28,885 --> 00:20:32,048
What? l have the smoothest balls
in Iceland.

246
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:35,281
-You wanna see?
-No, no, no, you're not-- I’m good.

247
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:37,722
Put your anteater away,
it's totally creepy.

248
00:20:39,228 --> 00:20:42,129
-You're not from Iceland, no?
-No. Fuck, no. American.

249
00:20:42,298 --> 00:20:44,994
Yeah, unlike him,
l had my foreskin removed at birth.

250
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:47,798
Hygiene and-- Am l talking?

251
00:20:48,204 --> 00:20:50,729
-I’m Josh.
-Natalya.

252
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,167
-And this is Svetlana.
-Hi.

253
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,505
Hi, I’m Paxton.

254
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,674
-And this is Oli.
-The King of the Swing.

255
00:20:59,148 --> 00:21:01,446
Hello.

256
00:21:02,785 --> 00:21:04,946
Face on the ass. Never gets old.

257
00:21:05,121 --> 00:21:06,588
Jesus.

258
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:08,690
So where are you girls from?

259
00:21:08,858 --> 00:21:11,122
I’m from Italy,
but my parents are Russian.

260
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:13,356
Prague.

261
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,322
Prague's cool. Kafka.

262
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,962
So, Natalya....

263
00:21:21,137 --> 00:21:23,765
-Yeah?
-You're Russian, eh?

264
00:21:45,294 --> 00:21:48,957
Oh, my God.
Look, there are too many girls.

265
00:21:52,335 --> 00:21:54,963
-This is awesome.
-Yes.

266
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:38,647
l mean, l was a senior,
you know, she was a junior...

267
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,215
...and then l graduated,
and it was weird, you know.

268
00:22:41,384 --> 00:22:45,753
l mean, I’m totally over it.
It's-- You know, it's cool.

269
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:47,355
It's okay.

270
00:22:47,523 --> 00:22:49,047
Look, Vala is here.

271
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:52,717
-Who?
-Vala, from front desk. Vala.

272
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,794
-All right, Oli.
-Hey, l told you, man.

273
00:22:56,966 --> 00:22:59,059
I’m the King of the Swing.

274
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:02,571
Come, let's dance.

275
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,313
-Does the cigarette bother you?
-No, it's--

276
00:23:13,483 --> 00:23:15,246
l put away.

277
00:23:15,418 --> 00:23:17,682
It's fine, l....

278
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,755
I’m gonna go get some fresh air.

279
00:23:21,023 --> 00:23:23,924
But I’ll be back, okay?

280
00:23:46,215 --> 00:23:47,443
Cigarette.

281
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:50,018
Cigarette.

282
00:23:50,553 --> 00:23:51,747
Aren't you a little young?

283
00:23:51,921 --> 00:23:53,718
-Dollar.
-What?

284
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:55,619
Dollar.

285
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:03,225
-Dollar.
-Here you go.

286
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:12,974
Here, children commit
the most crime.

287
00:24:13,409 --> 00:24:16,537
They don't care.
They will attack anyone.

288
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:19,741
-You're okay?
-Yeah, yeah. Thank you.

289
00:24:22,185 --> 00:24:24,210
Hey, let me buy you a drink.

290
00:24:24,487 --> 00:24:25,920
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

291
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:29,457
Hey, Josh.

292
00:24:29,625 --> 00:24:31,092
Faggot.

293
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:33,895
Go with your friends. It's okay.

294
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:35,894
l wanted to say sorry about earlier.

295
00:24:36,065 --> 00:24:38,090
About the way l reacted.

296
00:24:38,601 --> 00:24:40,262
We cool?

297
00:24:45,074 --> 00:24:48,305
l would have done
the same thing at your age.

298
00:24:50,513 --> 00:24:52,572
It's not easy...

299
00:24:53,182 --> 00:24:55,412
...but from my experience...

300
00:24:55,585 --> 00:24:58,918
...choosing to have a family
was the right choice for me.

301
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,621
Now l have my little girl...

302
00:25:02,792 --> 00:25:06,558
...who means more to me
than anything in the world.

303
00:25:07,396 --> 00:25:10,388
But you should do...

304
00:25:10,566 --> 00:25:12,932
...whatever's right for you.

305
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:18,164
Excuse me, it's my turn now.

306
00:25:33,923 --> 00:25:35,754
Should we be doing this
with them there?

307
00:25:35,925 --> 00:25:37,722
Yeah, it's okay.

308
00:25:39,295 --> 00:25:43,459
-Yeah, baby. Josh, give it to me, baby.
-Okay, all right. Okay, stop!

309
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:46,101
-All right.
-Come on, big boy.

310
00:25:46,269 --> 00:25:48,669
-We go to spa.
-Spa.

311
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,500
Spa, spa, spa.
Being dirty while getting clean.

312
00:25:51,674 --> 00:25:53,232
Bye.

313
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:20,724
Mission accomplished.

314
00:27:23,966 --> 00:27:27,834
You know that Amsterdam kid
with the thing on his lip?

315
00:27:28,003 --> 00:27:30,733
I’m gonna send him
a really nice thank-you note.

316
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,032
Be quiet.

317
00:27:36,879 --> 00:27:39,143
They're showering together.

318
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:44,416
Shit, man. We're never leaving here.

319
00:27:46,322 --> 00:27:48,187
l guess Oli's not back yet.

320
00:27:48,357 --> 00:27:51,121
No, dude, he probably
took that desk girl home.

321
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:52,817
We'll see him at breakfast.

322
00:28:06,642 --> 00:28:10,840
-What's the name?
-Oli Ericson, 23 7.

323
00:28:13,783 --> 00:28:16,377
How are we supposed to
understand this without subtitles?

324
00:28:16,552 --> 00:28:17,678
Fucking gay.

325
00:28:17,853 --> 00:28:19,878
Yeah, he checked out this morning.

326
00:28:20,556 --> 00:28:22,456
You mean he took his
passport to go out?

327
00:28:22,625 --> 00:28:24,991
No, it say he checked out
this morning.

328
00:28:25,928 --> 00:28:28,158
-When this morning?
-l don't know exact time.

329
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:30,491
l could find out tomorrow.

330
00:28:36,806 --> 00:28:39,707
Hey, Oli, it's Pax.
Are you still with that chick?

331
00:28:39,875 --> 00:28:41,809
Can l leave a note
in case he comes back?

332
00:28:41,977 --> 00:28:44,002
Okay, cool. Yeah.

333
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:48,807
All right.

334
00:28:53,088 --> 00:28:56,353
He's probably still with Vala.
When she call me, l call you, okay?

335
00:28:56,525 --> 00:28:58,322
Okay.

336
00:28:58,494 --> 00:29:00,052
-We see you later, right?
-Yeah.

337
00:29:00,729 --> 00:29:02,321
Okay.

338
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:04,627
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

339
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,464
Oli, hey, it's me again.
We're gonna go into town, so call us.

340
00:29:09,638 --> 00:29:11,299
You're gay.
Damn voice mail again.

341
00:29:11,474 --> 00:29:14,671
-Hi! Hi! Hi!
-Hi.

342
00:29:14,844 --> 00:29:16,539
Your friend.

343
00:29:17,813 --> 00:29:20,873
-What the hell?
-Your friend, my friend.

344
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,915
What does that say?

345
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:25,614
<i>Sayonara.</i> Your friend.

346
00:29:25,788 --> 00:29:27,415
What, they left? Like, together?

347
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:30,491
That doesn't make any sense.
Oli doesn't even like Asian girls.

348
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:32,251
l mean, no offense, but--

349
00:29:32,428 --> 00:29:33,952
When did she send this to you?

350
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:36,256
This picture. Today?

351
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,734
Could you do me a favor
and send this picture to my phone?

352
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:40,891
This picture.

353
00:29:43,272 --> 00:29:44,637
That water looks fucking cold.

354
00:29:44,807 --> 00:29:47,332
You know, if you fell in,
you'd die in 90 seconds.

355
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,944
Dude, did l tell you l saw
a girl drown when l was 8?

356
00:29:50,613 --> 00:29:52,911
-Where?
-Lake Michigan.

357
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:58,019
Lt was fucked up, man.
This little girl, probably 4 or 5.

358
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:01,845
We made eye contact,
which was a weird thing, you know...

359
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:04,618
...and she was yelling for me
to help her.

360
00:30:04,793 --> 00:30:06,158
Yeah? What did you do?

361
00:30:06,328 --> 00:30:10,162
l ran to the lifeguard, who was busy
talking to her boyfriend at the time...

362
00:30:10,332 --> 00:30:12,892
...and l yelled, you know,
''There's this girl drowning.''

363
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:15,935
And she couldn't see her.
Probably thought I was making it up.

364
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:20,132
And then a second later all you could
hear was this horrible screaming.

365
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,907
Lt was that little girl's mother, dude.

366
00:30:23,612 --> 00:30:25,011
Her kid was dead.

367
00:30:25,481 --> 00:30:28,245
-Jesus.
-I had nightmares for years after that.

368
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:32,148
I mean, I'd wake up every fucking
night hearing that mother scream.

369
00:30:32,321 --> 00:30:33,913
I just....

370
00:30:34,089 --> 00:30:35,886
I just felt like I could have
done more.

371
00:30:36,058 --> 00:30:38,652
You did the right thing.
Could've been a double drowning.

372
00:30:38,827 --> 00:30:41,057
Yeah, well, I didn't see it
that way at the time.

373
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,859
All I knew was this little girl was dead
and her mother's life was ruined.

374
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:47,195
What makes you think of this now?

375
00:30:51,373 --> 00:30:52,431
Bubble gum.

376
00:30:53,642 --> 00:30:56,372
-Sorry, kid.
-No, no. Give him some.

377
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:01,880
What are you doing?

378
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:05,545
These fucking kids are dangerous.

379
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,789
Hey, Oli.

380
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:10,152
-Hey, Oli.
-Hey.

381
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:14,695
-Hey.
-Hey.

382
00:31:14,863 --> 00:31:18,162
-Hey, Oli. Hey!
-Oli!

383
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,969
It's your lucky day, Josh.

384
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,767
A museum.

385
00:32:12,554 --> 00:32:13,885
How's it hanging?

386
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:18,789
-What the fuck?
-Holy shit.

387
00:32:18,961 --> 00:32:20,929
-He got you.
-Yeah, that's hilarious.

388
00:32:21,096 --> 00:32:22,324
Okay.

389
00:32:23,032 --> 00:32:24,590
Hey, Oli.

390
00:32:26,301 --> 00:32:27,996
Hey, Oli.

391
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:29,467
Hey, hey.

392
00:32:31,373 --> 00:32:32,670
Excuse me?

393
00:32:33,475 --> 00:32:36,603
I’m sorry, I thought you
were someone else.

394
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:39,407
Well, I’m not.

395
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,173
Where did you get that jacket?

396
00:32:43,585 --> 00:32:47,112
-Hey, I’m talking to you, man.
-Get your fucking hands off me.

397
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:51,417
This is my jacket.

398
00:33:07,509 --> 00:33:09,170
It's from Oli.

399
00:33:10,646 --> 00:33:11,635
'I’m go home''?

400
00:34:10,372 --> 00:34:12,966
I don't know,
maybe his battery died.

401
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:16,610
Hey, Kana, when are you leaving?

402
00:34:17,913 --> 00:34:21,212
I’m sorry. When are you going away?

403
00:34:21,817 --> 00:34:23,944
Tomorrow, I go.

404
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:25,484
Okay, because we may go too.

405
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:29,454
Do you wanna go to the train with us?
To the train station?

406
00:34:31,193 --> 00:34:33,161
Tomorrow, train?

407
00:34:33,328 --> 00:34:34,989
Yeah, yeah.

408
00:34:37,733 --> 00:34:39,633
-Hello, Josh.
-Hey.

409
00:34:39,802 --> 00:34:41,736
-Hey.
-Come, we go for disco?

410
00:34:41,904 --> 00:34:45,601
Actually, I just wanna find my friend
and get the fuck out of here.

411
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,740
Okay, we'll see you.

412
00:34:56,518 --> 00:35:00,215
Hey, guys, hold up a sec.
We'll be right out.

413
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,016
Okay.

414
00:35:04,459 --> 00:35:06,984
-Josh, come here, dude.
-Yeah, what?

415
00:35:07,496 --> 00:35:10,727
It's not their fault Oli disappeared,
so stop acting like it is.

416
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:13,026
-I’m annoyed he'd ditch us.
-I’m pissed too.

417
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:14,692
But we're not in America.

418
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,805
I mean, people meet each other
and split without saying shit.

419
00:35:18,273 --> 00:35:19,900
It's just how they do it over here.

420
00:35:20,075 --> 00:35:22,976
As well as we may think we know Oli,
we don't really know him.

421
00:35:23,145 --> 00:35:24,669
He could've gone
somewhere with that girl.

422
00:35:24,686 --> 00:35:28,240
Fuck, maybe he's in Iceland.
The guy's got a daughter.

423
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,748
So let's look at our options.

424
00:35:29,918 --> 00:35:33,183
We can A, fuck these girls one more
night and then head to Barcelona...

425
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:36,688
...or B, not fuck them,
then head to Barcelona anyway.

426
00:35:36,859 --> 00:35:40,659
Think about it. When I’m studying for
the bar and you're writing your thesis...

427
00:35:40,829 --> 00:35:42,922
...this is the shit
we're gonna think about.

428
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:46,158
Okay. All right, he doesn't show up,
it's his problem.

429
00:35:46,335 --> 00:35:48,667
-It's his problem.
-All right.

430
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:50,964
All right.

431
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:54,438
Hey, Kana, you wanna go
to the disco with us?

432
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:56,367
You know, disco?
Dancing?

433
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,879
No?

434
00:36:39,821 --> 00:36:41,914
Josh?

435
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,854
-I’m gonna go back.
-Are you okay?

436
00:36:45,027 --> 00:36:46,358
I’m, like-- I’m tired.

437
00:36:46,528 --> 00:36:49,088
Actually, I have, like, a headache.

438
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:52,025
If you want, l will go with you.

439
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:56,695
No, no, no, I’ll just see you
back at the room.

440
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,867
Goodbye.

441
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:07,006
<i>Fucking pussy.

442
00:37:39,514 --> 00:37:41,038
-Josh.
-Vala.

443
00:37:41,216 --> 00:37:43,047
You don't look well.

444
00:37:43,218 --> 00:37:45,448
-No, l--
-Here, let me help you.

445
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:48,680
l feel sick.

446
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:02,068
Where is...?
Where is Oli?

447
00:38:02,237 --> 00:38:04,262
You need rest.

448
00:38:31,867 --> 00:38:33,960
Where's the restroom?

449
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,037
Past the bar, in the back.

450
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:45,104
You guys cool?

451
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:48,213
-Vodka Red Bull.
-Vodka Red Bull, <i>danke</i>.

452
00:38:53,088 --> 00:38:54,555
Yeah.

453
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,327
Hey!

454
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,231
Hey!

455
00:40:03,291 --> 00:40:05,156
Open the door.

456
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:27,779
Oh, fuck.

Please, no, sir.

00:41:30,045 --> 00:41:31,205
What the fuck?

467
00:41:31,813 --> 00:41:34,043
Please, l didn't fucking do anything.

468
00:41:35,116 --> 00:41:36,708
What the fuck?

469
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:40,912
What the fuck?
This is such fucking bullshit.

470
00:41:41,089 --> 00:41:42,579
What the fuck is this?

471
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:44,588

Oh, my God! No, no, no, no!

00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:54,297
Oh, please. What the fuck?

00:41:54,469 --> 00:41:56,869
No, no, no, no, fuck! No!

477
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,811
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

478
00:42:41,383 --> 00:42:42,611
You.

479
00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:49,886
Why?

480
00:42:53,061 --> 00:42:56,929
l always wanted to be a surgeon...

481
00:42:57,532 --> 00:43:00,330
...but the boards wouldn't pass me.

482
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,800
Can you guess why?

483
00:43:13,548 --> 00:43:15,038
You see?

484
00:43:16,685 --> 00:43:18,915
So l went into business...

485
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:21,749
...but business is so boring.

486
00:43:22,490 --> 00:43:26,517
You buy things, you sell them.
You make money, you spend money.

487
00:43:26,695 --> 00:43:28,424
What kind of life is that?

488
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:31,394
A surgeon...

489
00:43:31,566 --> 00:43:35,297
...he holds the very essence
of life in his hands.

490
00:43:35,637 --> 00:43:37,195
Your life.

491
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:39,840
He touches it.

492
00:43:41,343 --> 00:43:43,834
He has a relationship with it.

493
00:43:44,212 --> 00:43:46,703
He's part of it.

494
00:43:49,317 --> 00:43:52,115
Please, please.
Just let me go, please.

495
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:54,847
You want to go?

496
00:43:55,357 --> 00:43:57,848
ls that what you want?

497
00:44:16,911 --> 00:44:19,345
Oh, my God!

498
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,854
Fuck! Oh, fuck!

499
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,591
You are free to go.

500
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,852
Oh, fuck. No!

501
00:45:09,030 --> 00:45:12,090
No. No, fuck. No, fuck--

502
00:45:13,134 --> 00:45:15,796
Please, l have money.
I’ll fucking pay you.

503
00:45:15,970 --> 00:45:17,835
Ten times, two times,
whatever you want--

504
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,405
-Pay me?
-Yes.

505
00:45:19,566 --> 00:45:21,056
No one is paying me.

506
00:45:21,234 --> 00:45:24,138
In fact, l am the one paying them!

507
00:45:35,390 --> 00:45:38,223
Relax. Relax, bro.

508
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,127
Oh, shit.

509
00:45:56,177 --> 00:45:58,407
-Two thirty-seven, please.
-Two three seven.

510
00:45:59,013 --> 00:46:00,241
Didn't you check out?

511
00:46:01,549 --> 00:46:02,811
No, not yet.

512
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,708
Not yet.

513
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:08,583
-This your bag?
-Yeah.

514
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:11,350
The maid brought it here.
You're checked out.

515
00:46:11,659 --> 00:46:13,251
-l didn't check out.
-Lt says.

516
00:46:13,428 --> 00:46:15,089
Lt happened this morning.

517
00:46:15,263 --> 00:46:17,390
This is bullshit.
Did somebody leave a note?

518
00:46:17,565 --> 00:46:19,624
Because l didn't
fucking check out, dude.

519
00:46:20,134 --> 00:46:23,365
No, man, just this bag.
If it's a mistake--

520
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:26,098
Yeah, it's definitely a mistake.
We need a fucking room.

521
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:29,641
Chill out, man. You're on vacation.

522
00:46:31,212 --> 00:46:32,839
Two three seven.

523
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,642
Hey, was there a Japanese girl
waiting in the lobby for somebody?

524
00:46:39,821 --> 00:46:42,915
No, think they left this morning.

525
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,581
Yeah.

526
00:46:47,395 --> 00:46:49,158
I’m sorry, dude.

527
00:46:56,905 --> 00:46:59,305
Oh, I’m sorry. Excuse me.

528
00:47:00,475 --> 00:47:03,376
It's okay. We are going to the spa.

529
00:47:03,545 --> 00:47:05,536
You will join us?

530
00:47:10,351 --> 00:47:12,319
You should come.

531
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,985
Hey, Josh, call me
soon as you get this, man.

532
00:47:21,162 --> 00:47:23,392
l got locked in that club.
Lt was retarded, dude.

533
00:47:23,565 --> 00:47:25,192
I’m at the hostel.

534
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:29,726
Svetlana!

535
00:47:31,606 --> 00:47:33,540
Svetlana!

536
00:48:04,238 --> 00:48:05,466
Hey!

537
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:12,807
You little fucker.

538
00:48:29,998 --> 00:48:31,363
Jesus.

539
00:48:31,532 --> 00:48:33,261
Wait at hostel for your friends.

540
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:35,925
They will look for you there
no matter what.

541
00:48:36,104 --> 00:48:40,370
Yeah, l know. But, see, my friend
Josh is the kind of guy who--

542
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:44,341
He just wouldn't check out without
so much as leaving a note, you know.

543
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,113
He's the responsible one.

544
00:48:47,281 --> 00:48:50,273
Yeah, but maybe he worried
his belongings get stolen...

545
00:48:50,451 --> 00:48:52,476
...so he take them when he go out.

546
00:48:52,654 --> 00:48:55,179
Someone misplace if he leaves note.

547
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:57,256
Lt is not uncommon.

548
00:49:00,061 --> 00:49:02,586
Yeah, well, is there
anything else that l can do?

549
00:49:03,931 --> 00:49:06,559
There's nothing right now.

550
00:49:06,968 --> 00:49:08,196
We have his picture...

551
00:49:08,369 --> 00:49:11,600
...if we see him, or he is picked up,
or something happen...

552
00:49:11,773 --> 00:49:14,537
...we contact you at hostel, yeah?

553
00:49:14,709 --> 00:49:16,176
Okay.

554
00:49:18,179 --> 00:49:19,646
Where are you from?

555
00:49:20,548 --> 00:49:21,810
California.

556
00:49:23,751 --> 00:49:26,413
You are so far from home.

557
00:50:49,937 --> 00:50:52,929
Paxton. Come, have a drink.

558
00:50:56,077 --> 00:50:58,841
Hello, Mr. American.

559
00:51:01,082 --> 00:51:03,482
-Did you get my messages?
-Which one?

560
00:51:03,918 --> 00:51:05,180
There are so many.

561
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:08,049

562
00:51:08,556 --> 00:51:09,989

Have you seen Josh?

564
00:51:16,697 --> 00:51:18,392
Ln English, please.

565
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:21,263
He is with your friend...

566
00:51:21,435 --> 00:51:23,300
...the King of the Swing.

567
00:51:23,905 --> 00:51:26,897
-He's with Oli.
-Why you leave last night?

568
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:31,343
Did you not listen to my messages?
l got locked in a storage room.

569
00:51:31,512 --> 00:51:34,845
l don't know,
l got sick and passed out.

570
00:51:38,219 --> 00:51:41,154
-What?
-She said you met another girl.

571
00:51:41,322 --> 00:51:43,187
Where are my friends?

572
00:51:49,197 --> 00:51:51,222
The art show.

573
00:51:52,433 --> 00:51:54,993
-You mean like a museum?
-No, no, no.

574
00:51:55,837 --> 00:52:01,469
Not museum.
They went-- How you say, for artist?

575
00:52:01,642 --> 00:52:04,668
-Exhibit.
-Exhibit for artist.

576
00:52:04,846 --> 00:52:06,336
No, that doesn't make any sense.

577
00:52:06,514 --> 00:52:08,175
Why? What is wrong?

578
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:11,443
Well, they didn't leave a note.
They didn't call or do anything.

579
00:52:11,719 --> 00:52:13,084
They tell us to tell you.

580
00:52:13,254 --> 00:52:15,222
Yeah, but l tried calling them all day.

581
00:52:15,389 --> 00:52:18,483
Yes, but their phone, the battery die
and they do not have--

582
00:52:18,659 --> 00:52:20,684
How you say, for electricity?

583
00:52:20,862 --> 00:52:23,831

-Have a drink.

590
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:58,021
You want gum?

No.

592
00:53:22,290 --> 00:53:23,848
Too bad for you.

00:54:34,562 --> 00:54:37,497
Excuse me. Excuse me.

How is it in there?

597

Be careful.

598
00:54:43,971 --> 00:54:45,302
Why is that?

599
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,238
You could spend all your money...

600
00:54:50,644 --> 00:54:52,305
...in there.

601
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:28,809

644
01:13:35,568 --> 01:13:39,402
l feel fucking ridiculous in this thing,
but l guess you need it, huh?

645
01:13:42,041 --> 01:13:45,033
Yeah. I’ll tell you something....

646
01:13:45,211 --> 01:13:49,170
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Wait a sec.

647
01:13:50,483 --> 01:13:52,280
How was it?

648
01:13:56,723 --> 01:13:58,122
Good.

649
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:01,624
Well, goddamn, motherfucker,
for this money, it better be. Shit.

650
01:14:01,794 --> 01:14:04,092
What did you go for, a local?

651
01:14:04,264 --> 01:14:05,492
What, European?

652
01:14:07,333 --> 01:14:09,096
-American.
-An Amer--?

653
01:14:09,836 --> 01:14:12,805
Ain't that a bitch. Big spender.
l fucking-- l love it.

654
01:14:12,972 --> 01:14:15,805
l just fucking love that shit.
You know what they got for me?

655
01:14:15,975 --> 01:14:18,000
They told me they lined up
something special.

656
01:14:18,178 --> 01:14:20,271
I’ve been waiting almost a week
for this shit.

657
01:14:20,446 --> 01:14:22,209
For 50 grand,
she better be worth it.

658
01:14:22,382 --> 01:14:24,612
But it's supposed to be
a real rush, right?

659
01:14:24,784 --> 01:14:29,448
It's like-- They told me
it's like a real fucking rush, right?

660
01:14:29,622 --> 01:14:31,146
Come here.

661
01:14:32,091 --> 01:14:34,958
I’ve been all over the world.
You know, I’ve been everywhere.

662
01:14:35,128 --> 01:14:37,961
And the bottom line is,
pussy's pussy.

663
01:14:38,464 --> 01:14:42,230
You know, every strip club,
every whorehouse, every....

664
01:14:42,402 --> 01:14:44,063
It's all the same shit.

665
01:14:44,237 --> 01:14:48,264
l just fucked a girl two days ago, l don't
even remember the color of her tits.

666
01:14:48,608 --> 01:14:54,171
But this, this is something
you never forget, right?

667
01:14:55,949 --> 01:14:56,938
Right?

668
01:14:58,785 --> 01:15:00,582
-Never.
-Never, right.

669
01:15:01,621 --> 01:15:04,249
Let me show you something.
Pretty sweet. Check this out.

670
01:15:04,424 --> 01:15:07,393
What do you think of this?
Come on, let me see yours.

671
01:15:08,695 --> 01:15:11,596
Come on, let me see yours.
We're all in the same club.

672
01:15:12,432 --> 01:15:13,922
I’ll be out in a second, guy.

673
01:15:14,901 --> 01:15:18,302
Can l ask you something personal?
Do you mind?

674
01:15:19,672 --> 01:15:20,900
How'd you do it?

675
01:15:22,475 --> 01:15:23,772
Did you do it real slow...

676
01:15:24,377 --> 01:15:27,005
...or did you just get it over with
right away?

677
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:28,943
That's why l asked for
the fucking gun.

678
01:15:29,115 --> 01:15:31,208
Because l just wanted
to fucking do it quick.

679
01:15:31,384 --> 01:15:32,976
l just wanted to get it over with.

680
01:15:33,152 --> 01:15:35,746
But now I’m thinking maybe
l wanna feel it, you know?

681
01:15:35,922 --> 01:15:37,549
l wanna fucking feel that shit.

682
01:15:37,724 --> 01:15:41,057
So l don't know what to-- I’m thinking--
What do you think l should do?

683
01:15:44,397 --> 01:15:46,194
-Make it quick.
-Make it quick.

684
01:15:46,366 --> 01:15:48,334
Yes.

685
01:15:49,002 --> 01:15:50,936
Yeah, that's-- No, fuck that shit.

686
01:15:51,104 --> 01:15:54,369
Fuck this, too fucking American, dude.
I’m going fucking old school.

687
01:15:54,540 --> 01:15:56,235
Who wants this, motherfucker?

688
01:15:56,409 --> 01:15:59,105
Who wants this shit?
Come on, motherfucker.

689
01:15:59,279 --> 01:16:00,974
Bring it.

690
01:17:29,235 --> 01:17:30,600
Hey, buddy.

691
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,466
Get your own fucking room.
l paid for this.

692
01:17:36,342 --> 01:17:37,673
What are you, fucking deaf?

693
01:17:46,552 --> 01:17:47,849
Kana.

694
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:58,521
-Oh, my God.
-What do you want me to do, Kana?

695
01:18:01,134 --> 01:18:05,730
What? l don't understand
what you're saying. What?

696
01:18:11,911 --> 01:18:18,111
Fuck. I’m sorry, I’m sorry.
Hold still. Hold still.

697
01:18:18,284 --> 01:18:22,584
-Fuck. Oh, God. God.
-No. No!

698
01:18:22,822 --> 01:18:24,756
-Shit.
-No!

699
01:18:24,924 --> 01:18:28,291
I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

700
01:18:45,745 --> 01:18:47,042
Fuck!

701
01:18:47,213 --> 01:18:48,646
Fuck!

702
01:18:52,418 --> 01:18:54,147
Fuck!

703
01:20:10,530 --> 01:20:12,794
We're gonna get the fuck
out of here, Kana.

704
01:20:36,856 --> 01:20:39,416
Move this fucking truck!

705
01:22:42,481 --> 01:22:43,709
Fuck.

706
01:22:56,462 --> 01:22:57,952
We're almost there.

707
01:23:03,369 --> 01:23:04,597
Oh, my God.

708
01:23:08,007 --> 01:23:09,269
Oh, no.

709
01:23:13,813 --> 01:23:15,041
Fuck.

710
01:24:47,339 --> 01:24:49,830
Kana.

711
01:24:51,343 --> 01:24:53,140
Kana.

712
01:25:02,721 --> 01:25:04,689
Come here.

713
01:25:13,766 --> 01:25:16,599
No. No, Kana. Kana.

714
01:25:20,940 --> 01:25:22,464
No, Kana.

715
01:26:17,596 --> 01:26:21,726
No, thank you.
l prefer to use my hands.

716
01:26:22,101 --> 01:26:25,559
l believe people have lost
their relationship with food.

717
01:26:25,738 --> 01:26:26,762
They do not think:

718
01:26:26,939 --> 01:26:30,204
''This is something who gave its life
so l would not go hungry.''

719
01:26:30,376 --> 01:26:34,972
l like to have a connection
with something that died for me.

720
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,495
l get a lot of money for you...

721
01:33:27,672 --> 01:33:30,800
...and that make you <i>my bitch</i>.

721
