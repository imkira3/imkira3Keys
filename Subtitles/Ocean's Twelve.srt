1
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:03,879
Hi.

2
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,576
- How'd it go?
- Lousy.

3
00:01:13,681 --> 00:01:17,539
Got a '63 Thunderbird
I would've sold in a day a year ago.

4
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:20,250
Now they just wanna look at the pictures.

5
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:23,065
You smell nice.

6
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,904
How was your day?

7
00:01:29,113 --> 00:01:30,677
It was great.

8
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:34,118
We had a big breakthrough
in the Bulgari case.

9
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,203
Really?

10
00:01:36,933 --> 00:01:39,018
We found a boot print.

11
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:41,625
A really good one.

12
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:45,170
The left heel was worn way down.

13
00:01:49,445 --> 00:01:51,010
That's a good lead.

14
00:01:51,114 --> 00:01:52,574
I know.

15
00:01:52,782 --> 00:01:54,972
We found a hair.

16
00:01:54,972 --> 00:01:56,536
A hair, wow.

17
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,309
It's at the lab.

18
00:01:58,413 --> 00:02:02,584
So hopefully by noon tomorrow
we'll find out his DNA ...

19
00:02:02,688 --> 00:02:06,337
what kind of conditioner he uses,
if he streaks his hair ...

20
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:09,987
if he has dandruff, everything.
Isn't that amazing?

21
00:02:10,091 --> 00:02:12,177
That is amazing.

22
00:02:12,177 --> 00:02:16,347
You know, having those
extra men really paid off.

23
00:02:16,347 --> 00:02:18,537
Oh, you're just being modest.

24
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:21,248
Are you coming to bed, baby?

25
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:24,793
I'm just gonna have a shower.
Don't let me keep you up.

26
00:03:07,119 --> 00:03:08,475
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

27
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:12,229
- And you are Mr ...?
- Diaz. Miguel Diaz.

28
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:16,295
- And you're here to open a ...?
- A SEP retirement account.

29
00:03:16,295 --> 00:03:20,153
Terrific. Oh, it says here
you're already retired.

30
00:03:20,153 --> 00:03:22,656
- I am.
- What was your occupation?

31
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,680
I was a high school basketball coach.

32
00:03:25,784 --> 00:03:28,391
You must have done
very well for yourself.

33
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:30,163
- What's your name?
- Greg.

34
00:03:30,163 --> 00:03:34,751
Greg. Let me ask you something.
Do you have safe-deposit boxes here?

35
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:36,837
Yes, they're housed in our vault.

36
00:03:36,941 --> 00:03:39,860
- In your vault?
- It's over 100 years old.

37
00:03:39,965 --> 00:03:43,614
Of course, we've made some
state-of-the-art upgrades since then.

38
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:47,264
You know, I was once in a vault
while it was being robbed.

39
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:51,017
That must have been quite an experience.

40
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:52,686
Yeah.

41
00:03:58,108 --> 00:03:59,776
Yeah.

42
00:04:11,864 --> 00:04:13,949
That's too oxblood.

43
00:04:18,016 --> 00:04:19,892
What do y'all do?

44
00:04:20,935 --> 00:04:22,916
My husband and I?

45
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,713
Well, he's retired. Just retired.

46
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:30,320
It's great. It's ...

47
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,595
And I did work at an art gallery.

48
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:39,391
And, you know, I love art,
obviously, and paint and ...

49
00:04:39,391 --> 00:04:42,624
That's too brown. I'm sorry.
Do you mind if l --?

50
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:45,230
- Hey, it's your paint.
- Okay. Thank you.

51
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:00,350
May I show you something specific?

52
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,686
Well, I was looking
for something for my wife.

53
00:05:03,686 --> 00:05:05,459
What is it, a special occasion?

54
00:05:05,459 --> 00:05:08,274
It's our second third anniversary.

55
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:11,715
Excuse me. Hello, Mrs. Diaz,
we were just talking about you.

56
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:14,843
- How'd it go at the bank?
- It was easy.

57
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,407
I mean great.

58
00:05:16,512 --> 00:05:18,180
No, you mean easy.

59
00:05:18,388 --> 00:05:19,848
What?

60
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:22,768
You're doing recon work
on our anniversary?

61
00:05:22,768 --> 00:05:25,270
- Tess.
- Let me ask you this:

62
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,398
- Where are you now?
- Casing a jewelry store.

63
00:05:28,607 --> 00:05:32,778
That's an interesting way to ease back
into society, which was your idea.

64
00:05:32,882 --> 00:05:34,968
- Should I stop painting now?
- Listen.

65
00:05:35,072 --> 00:05:39,243
Let's talk about something important.
I can't find a restaurant for tonight.

66
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:42,788
- Well, we'll stay in.
- Really?

67
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:46,646
- Great. I'll cook.
- No, I'll cook. You talk.

68
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,523
You want me to talk?

69
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:52,581
Words and everything? That's what
they make flowers for, you know.

70
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,046
- Oh, no, Danny.
- What is it?

71
00:06:00,297 --> 00:06:02,174
Tess ...

72
00:06:02,279 --> 00:06:03,738
what's wrong?

73
00:06:04,677 --> 00:06:08,013
There's water in the basement
and the pilot light is out.

74
00:06:08,013 --> 00:06:09,577
Hang up!

75
00:06:25,531 --> 00:06:27,304
Hello, Tess.

76
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,693
Where is he, Tess?

77
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:45,342
Where is ...

78
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,845
Mr. Diaz?

79
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,793
I want it back, Tess.

80
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,775
I want it all back.

81
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:05,362
- You got it all from the insurance company.
- I want my money back.

82
00:07:05,362 --> 00:07:08,803
The money that your husband
and his 10 friends stole from me.

83
00:07:08,908 --> 00:07:12,766
With interest. A hundred and sixty
million dollars over three years.

84
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:14,851
That's a lot of vig.

85
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:16,728
And I want it all back.

86
00:07:26,947 --> 00:07:29,032
He's got two weeks.

87
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,280
You'll never find them.

88
00:07:35,489 --> 00:07:37,991
They're way too smart for you.

89
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:40,702
Right.

90
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,560
You know, as it turns out ...

91
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:49,148
I'm not the only person in the world
looking for Ocean's 11.

92
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,131
All right.

93
00:08:14,382 --> 00:08:18,240
I'm the groom, and I'm not supposed
to say anything, but -- Make a speech.

94
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,932
But I don't care what the rules are,
because I really wanna thank my family.

95
00:08:22,932 --> 00:08:26,477
My mom and dad,
my Uncle Gary and Aunt Grace.

96
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:28,563
Uncle Ted, Aunt Celeste ...

97
00:08:28,667 --> 00:08:32,733
and their children, Denise and Jessica.

98
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:36,904
Bishop Tom and his wife, Helen,
my neighbor John ...

99
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:39,303
and his new girlfriend, Tanya.

100
00:08:39,407 --> 00:08:43,161
And all the guys at Lean Machine Inc.,
Bobo, Mullethead ...

101
00:08:43,161 --> 00:08:44,933
Big Sam.

102
00:08:47,748 --> 00:08:50,042
And everyone else
who's just been great ...

103
00:08:50,147 --> 00:08:53,483
in welcoming Sara
into the family. Thank you.

104
00:09:00,365 --> 00:09:04,223
Excuse me, everybody. I'd just like to --

105
00:09:04,223 --> 00:09:06,204
- Get up.
- Get up.

106
00:09:06,622 --> 00:09:08,707
- Get up.
- Get up. Get up.

107
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,472
- Walk.
- Walk.

108
00:09:12,453 --> 00:09:16,624
I'd like to say a few words
about commitment ...

109
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:18,709
about honor ...

110
00:09:18,917 --> 00:09:21,733
about responsibility ...

111
00:09:21,837 --> 00:09:26,112
about a very special someone
and admitting to her ...

112
00:09:26,112 --> 00:09:29,032
Get up. Pull the chair out.

113
00:09:32,473 --> 00:09:36,122
Admitting to her in front of everybody ...

114
00:09:36,644 --> 00:09:38,520
that her wedding ...

115
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:43,421
and that very special
honeymoon trip to Epcot Center ...

116
00:09:44,255 --> 00:09:46,549
will have to be postponed.

117
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:53,640
The photographer. Jesus, he's just a friend.
You met him at The Mint, remember?

118
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:56,976
Well, of course I am.

119
00:09:57,185 --> 00:10:01,356
You don't expect me to embarrass myself
by flying commercial?

120
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:05,944
On a budget? On a budget?

121
00:10:05,944 --> 00:10:10,219
Who was the only person who couldn't
get in on the Chinese cell-phone market?

122
00:10:10,219 --> 00:10:13,660
You, with all your connections.
What was that?

123
00:10:16,371 --> 00:10:20,750
He seemed really nice. And you know
it's hard for guys to be friends with me.

124
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,295
And you do this every time
that I meet someone new.

125
00:10:24,504 --> 00:10:29,196
And you know what?
It's getting really boring.

126
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:49,633
You think it's a accident
no one know about Fred "Bud" Kelly?

127
00:10:50,772 --> 00:10:53,170
Ain't no accident.
There's one explanation ...

128
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,881
and you ladies
know exactly what it is.

129
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:57,550
I'm gonna tell you what it is.

130
00:10:57,654 --> 00:11:01,825
Conspiracy, collusion, complicity.
That's all it is.

131
00:11:01,825 --> 00:11:05,996
Let me break it down like a fraction for you
about my man Fred "Bud" Kelly.

132
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,020
Fred "Bud" Kelly made skates
out of whiskey bottles ...

133
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:14,025
at his uncle's farm in the early 1900s.
That was over there in Nova Scotia.

134
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:18,404
I'm gonna tell you something else. You
never seen his name on the Stanley Cup.

135
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:22,471
You know why that is?
Because that son of a bitch Jim Crow ...

136
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,911
took his name off the history books.
You kind of --

137
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:29,874
Seems like every time I see you,
you're playing the race card, Frank.

138
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,959
Now, why is that?

139
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,192
You can let go of my feet now.

140
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:44,576
- This don't bother you?
- Of course it * * * * * * * bothers me, mate.

141
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,225
- What the * * * * do you want me to do?
- Well, it's * * * * * * up.

142
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:50,102
You can't hear none of the lyrics.

143
00:11:50,311 --> 00:11:53,752
You can't get with the beat
with all them * * * * * * * bleeps in it.

144
00:11:53,752 --> 00:11:58,131
You want a * * * * * * * single on the * * * * * * *
radio, it's what you have to * * * * * * * do.

145
00:11:58,131 --> 00:12:00,529
Well, it's * * * * * *, isn't it?
Totally * * * * * *!

146
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:03,136
* * * * * * * right, it's * * * * * * * * * * * * * .

147
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,786
What the * * * * is that?

148
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,122
Somebody must be in 2.

149
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,753
Oh, * * * *!

150
00:12:20,654 --> 00:12:23,782
And you haven't contacted
my father about any of this?

151
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:28,474
Because, really, I don't think there's
any reason to involve him or my mom.

152
00:12:34,305 --> 00:12:36,391
It's all on you, Linus.

153
00:12:37,121 --> 00:12:39,727
Okay. Good.

154
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:44,107
- Good. Because I have a whole network --
- Get out of my car.

155
00:12:44,107 --> 00:12:45,879
Thank you.

156
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:50,676
- Mr. Bloom?
- Yes.

157
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,595
There appears to be
a slight problem with your card.

158
00:12:56,515 --> 00:12:59,435
Oh, well, yes. Here.

159
00:12:59,435 --> 00:13:00,999
I'm afraid not, sir.

160
00:13:01,103 --> 00:13:02,667
Why?

161
00:13:02,771 --> 00:13:05,378
Your business manager
said you would understand.

162
00:13:05,482 --> 00:13:07,568
Todd said I would understand?

163
00:13:07,776 --> 00:13:10,696
No, Mr. Benedict.

164
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,388
Mr. Benedict. Mr ...

165
00:13:15,492 --> 00:13:17,369
Oh, yes.

166
00:13:17,473 --> 00:13:19,559
An old friend, a practical joker.

167
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:23,000
Tell Mr. Benedict
he's won this round, yes.

168
00:13:23,104 --> 00:13:25,815
Terry Benedict.

169
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:28,943
Old Terry.

170
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:31,550
She's looking at me
from across the room.

171
00:13:31,654 --> 00:13:34,365
And she's crazy about me, I can tell ...

172
00:13:35,617 --> 00:13:38,953
because she's been staring
at me all night. So suddenly ...

173
00:13:38,953 --> 00:13:42,186
I just go up to her, and I grab her.

174
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,897
And I've got her really close to me ...

175
00:13:45,001 --> 00:13:47,608
and her eyes are all fiery.

176
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:50,214
And my eyes are fiery.

177
00:13:50,319 --> 00:13:53,030
And it's like -- It's electric.

178
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:56,992
And I say to her, "Mom ...

179
00:13:58,765 --> 00:14:00,642
Mother ..."

180
00:14:02,414 --> 00:14:04,187
What?

181
00:14:08,775 --> 00:14:10,331
Thanks for letting me finish.

182
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,876
What can I say?

183
00:14:14,085 --> 00:14:16,066
You're a funny guy.

184
00:14:19,298 --> 00:14:22,218
Oh, yeah. My friend Rusty.
I'm worried about him.

185
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:24,407
He owns this hotel in Los Angeles ...

186
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:27,640
losing a lot of money,
and he's got no life.

187
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:31,498
He's a nice, bright kid,
but he's beating his brains out.

188
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:36,399
Do you think I could send something
through you, like, a message to him?

189
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,797
I read your palm, not his.

190
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,925
Somebody who could do that could do
very well. Anything on my health?

191
00:14:41,925 --> 00:14:44,636
- My hips are bothering me.
- Please.

192
00:14:47,868 --> 00:14:50,684
This? You couldn't see this?

193
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:57,253
- I tried knocking, he won't open.
- I'll handle it. I know him.

194
00:14:57,253 --> 00:14:59,755
Jesus Christ, are you people retarded?

195
00:14:59,755 --> 00:15:03,092
- It says, "Do not disturb"!
- It's me.

196
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:11,746
Hey.

197
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,770
Come on in.

198
00:15:14,979 --> 00:15:18,315
Jeez, Topher, you didn't
have to go all Frankie Muniz on me.

199
00:15:18,315 --> 00:15:21,756
I'm sorry.
Rust, look, I know this is your joint.

200
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,320
I just ...

201
00:15:24,259 --> 00:15:26,240
There's this girl.

202
00:15:27,283 --> 00:15:29,264
I love her, man.

203
00:15:29,368 --> 00:15:32,601
I love her, but she is driving me crazy!

204
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:34,790
I can't sleep. I can't work.

205
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:38,231
I quit the show. I totally phoned in
that Dennis Quaid movie.

206
00:15:38,231 --> 00:15:41,046
- I mean, it's like ...
- Hello?

207
00:15:41,046 --> 00:15:45,009
God, it's almost like this
Kabbalah crap doesn't even work!

208
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,033
Rusty, call for you.

209
00:15:51,153 --> 00:15:53,342
Dude, don't leave.

210
00:15:54,177 --> 00:15:56,888
- Yeah?
- I have a message for Robert Charles Ryan ...

211
00:15:57,096 --> 00:16:00,641
soon to be ex-owner
of the Standard Hotel.

212
00:16:01,997 --> 00:16:05,229
- You got him.
- Last time we spoke, you hung up on me.

213
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:08,149
You used some nasty words.
I got sensitive ears.

214
00:16:08,253 --> 00:16:10,860
I admit I was a little
emotional that evening.

215
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,050
Think about that night a lot,
don't you?

216
00:16:13,154 --> 00:16:16,491
I thought I'd be dead before
I heard the sound that killed me.

217
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:20,349
I've been asked to show restraint.
Otherwise, you would've gone out ...

218
00:16:20,349 --> 00:16:25,562
to your favorite car of all the 17 you own,
and as soon as you turned on the ignition ...

219
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:32,236
You got two weeks.

220
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:45,582
Now, you told me that your wife said
that he called it Ocean's 11.

221
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:48,606
Now, who decided that?
I'm a private contractor.

222
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,421
It was a collaboration.
That moniker is insulting.

223
00:16:51,421 --> 00:16:53,507
It was one job we did together.

224
00:16:53,507 --> 00:16:57,678
I don't know where this proprietary stance
comes from. It seems possessive.

225
00:16:57,678 --> 00:17:00,493
One could make the argument
that because it was Danny's idea --

226
00:17:00,701 --> 00:17:03,725
Hang on a minute.
We all had our own areas of expertise.

227
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,541
I mean, without us,
it don't leave your head, mate.

228
00:17:06,645 --> 00:17:08,626
It just hurts, you know, because ...

229
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,963
it seemed we all agreed
to call it "the Benedict job."

230
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:14,570
That's what we called it
when we were doing it.

231
00:17:14,674 --> 00:17:16,968
If you wanted to call it
something else --

232
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:19,262
When you have a problem,
who do you go to?

233
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:21,451
- Rusty.
- Rusty.

234
00:17:21,556 --> 00:17:23,537
Thanks.
Let's get back on the topic.

235
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:26,769
Based on what we stole, plus interest ...

236
00:17:26,873 --> 00:17:31,349
how much does everybody owe?
- $ 17.34 million.

237
00:17:31,349 --> 00:17:35,416
Assuming Benedict gives us
prime plus one, which I doubt.

238
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,605
Figure 19 to be safe.

239
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:41,672
Okay, 19 each. Anybody got that?

240
00:17:43,445 --> 00:17:46,468
What, you think the stock market's
some great mystery ...

241
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:50,848
beyond the realm of human
understanding? Didn't you see the signs?

242
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:55,123
I saw the signs.

243
00:17:55,227 --> 00:17:57,000
How much is everybody short?

244
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,355
How much you short?

245
00:17:59,502 --> 00:18:01,379
Fourteen. Fourteen.

246
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:04,403
- All but 5 million?
- Yeah. You gonna start with me?

247
00:18:04,507 --> 00:18:07,948
You don't know what it's like
to create something from scratch.

248
00:18:07,948 --> 00:18:10,659
- Well, with interest, I'm short 7.
- Eight.

249
00:18:10,868 --> 00:18:13,892
I spent about a million,
mostly on talent development.

250
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,437
That makes it 7 for me.
Boy, the interest just kills you.

251
00:18:17,437 --> 00:18:19,731
- I'm light 9.
- What's the interest?

252
00:18:19,731 --> 00:18:22,650
- About 6.
- Then I owe 6.

253
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,215
- How?
- What?

254
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:26,821
I've been staying at my parents' .

255
00:18:28,177 --> 00:18:29,949
I owe 25.

256
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,746
Hotels, man.

257
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,831
Saul?

258
00:18:37,144 --> 00:18:41,211
I haven't spent it all, but I will.

259
00:18:41,628 --> 00:18:43,713
I'm out, fellas.

260
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:48,718
As ranking old-timer,
I gotta say, I just can't do it.

261
00:18:49,031 --> 00:18:53,619
At my age, I think I earned
the right to be selfish.

262
00:18:53,723 --> 00:18:58,624
I wanna thank you all for the wonderful
opportunity. You're all aces in my book.

263
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:03,629
But I want the last check
I write to bounce.

264
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:07,904
Saul, you having a laugh?

265
00:19:08,113 --> 00:19:09,677
Saul.

266
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,489
- I can handle Saul's share.
- You don't have to.

267
00:19:17,593 --> 00:19:20,200
Who would I talk to if you were all dead?

268
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,954
That's a good point.
All right, I owe 10. Amazing?

269
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,523
Yeah, but it's a nice place.

270
00:19:31,357 --> 00:19:34,902
- So that comes to ...?
- Ninety-seven, give or take.

271
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,509
He didn't find us on his own.

272
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,116
- Someone helped him.
- Another thief.

273
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,931
Nobody we know would
violate rule number one.

274
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:46,268
What we do know is we need a job.
We need a high-paying job.

275
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,875
We're too hot to work
anywhere in this country.

276
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,524
- So we go abroad. How about we go --?
- We're on the 5:00.

277
00:19:53,045 --> 00:19:55,131
Good. Where are we going?

278
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,738
- Amsterdam.
- Amsterdam it is.

279
00:19:57,842 --> 00:20:00,970
- Clock's running. Let's go.
- Never been to Amsterdam.

280
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:03,577
I hear German girls are really hot.

281
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,454
Rusty.

282
00:20:05,975 --> 00:20:08,060
- Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

283
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,876
Don't tell Danny.

284
00:20:17,653 --> 00:20:20,573
Hey, Rusty. Rusty.

285
00:20:21,616 --> 00:20:23,180
Sorry, sorry. Hey.

286
00:20:23,284 --> 00:20:25,265
What are you doing?
What's wrong with you?

287
00:20:25,369 --> 00:20:26,725
- Nothing.
- What?

288
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:28,810
- Can l --? Can l --?
- What?

289
00:20:28,915 --> 00:20:31,834
- Just for a second, can I talk to you?
- What's wrong?

290
00:20:31,834 --> 00:20:33,607
I just -- I don't know.

291
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:37,569
This might not be the perfect time
or whatever to talk about it.

292
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:39,759
- Okay.
- I've been thinking.

293
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:45,702
I've been doing my homework.

294
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,517
And I'd really like ...

295
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:51,638
to play a more central role
this time around.

296
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:53,619
- Right.
- I feel like I've --

297
00:20:53,827 --> 00:20:55,913
- Right.
- I'm ready for that, and l --

298
00:20:55,913 --> 00:20:57,164
Way overdue.

299
00:20:57,268 --> 00:21:01,439
I was wondering if I could come to
the meeting and help you guys negotiate.

300
00:21:02,273 --> 00:21:06,653
Okay. It's just a sit-down with Matsui.

301
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:10,198
He's got his own language, this guy.

302
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:14,264
I watched you and Danny really closely
last time around. I learned a ton.

303
00:21:14,264 --> 00:21:18,227
Linus, in my professional opinion,
you're not ready.

304
00:21:19,582 --> 00:21:22,815
- Okay. Yeah, I mean --
- But -- But -- But ...

305
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:25,943
if you're convinced you are ready ...

306
00:21:25,943 --> 00:21:29,071
I can speak with Danny.
We can make this happen.

307
00:21:29,175 --> 00:21:31,678
But you gotta be sure.

308
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:37,934
- Not sure?
- No, I am.

309
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:40,958
- You're sure?
- But if I had a question, I could --

310
00:21:41,062 --> 00:21:43,043
- You would call me?
- Right. Okay.

311
00:21:43,043 --> 00:21:44,712
Any time.

312
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,484
- Okay.
- Okay.

313
00:21:46,484 --> 00:21:48,570
- All right.
- Okay. Awesome. Thank you.

314
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,029
Yeah.

315
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:55,869
I almost wasn't gonna
come over and say anything.

316
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,371
Then I'd still be sleeping.

317
00:21:58,892 --> 00:22:00,978
- Thanks, buddy.
- Yeah.

318
00:22:31,313 --> 00:22:33,398
- Who's there?
- Li -- It's --

319
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,275
- What?
- It's Linus.

320
00:22:35,379 --> 00:22:37,882
Is Rusty here? Rusty ...?

321
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:40,488
- Do you know where Rusty is?
- No.

322
00:22:40,801 --> 00:22:42,678
So have you met Matsui?

323
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:45,493
Seriously, what do you think of me ...

324
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:48,413
you know, in terms
of just leadership potential?

325
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:12,030
The fact that we're unemployable
shouldn't enter your mind.

326
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:14,950
Otherwise, you're wasting time.

327
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:17,452
Don't mention Benedict
unless he does first.

328
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,538
And if he does, tell him everything.

329
00:24:19,642 --> 00:24:23,292
Right. Stay on point. And don't
forget the other thing I told you.

330
00:24:23,396 --> 00:24:24,751
- What?
- About listening.

331
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:27,775
Relax. Remember, if we don't
get this job, we're dead.

332
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:30,069
Rusty, I tried calling you
all yesterday.

333
00:24:30,278 --> 00:24:34,240
So finally, she slams her vodka tonic
down on the tray and says:

334
00:24:34,344 --> 00:24:39,037
"Hey, maybe that's why
I've been feeling so warm recently."

335
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,094
Yeah.

336
00:24:56,971 --> 00:24:59,891
- So to business?
- To business.

337
00:24:59,995 --> 00:25:03,227
A doctor who specializes in skin diseases ...

338
00:25:03,227 --> 00:25:06,668
will dream he has fallen asleep
in front of the television.

339
00:25:06,668 --> 00:25:09,588
Later, he will wake up
in front of the television ...

340
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:12,090
but not remember his dream.

341
00:25:14,697 --> 00:25:16,574
Would you agree?

342
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:30,963
If all the animals along the equator
were capable of flattery ...

343
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:34,509
then Thanksgiving and Halloween ...

344
00:25:34,509 --> 00:25:37,533
would fall on the same date.

345
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:40,869
Yeah. Hey.

346
00:25:45,561 --> 00:25:47,751
When I was 4 years old ...

347
00:25:47,855 --> 00:25:52,331
I watched my mother
kill a spider with a tea cozy.

348
00:25:54,938 --> 00:25:58,066
Years later, I realized it was not a spider.

349
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,464
It was my Uncle Harold.

350
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:23,195
Oh, let the sun beat down upon my face

351
00:26:23,195 --> 00:26:25,802
Stars to fill my dreams

352
00:26:26,532 --> 00:26:30,703
I am a traveler in both time and space

353
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:33,518
To be where I have been

354
00:26:49,263 --> 00:26:51,661
Is he all right? Are we all right?

355
00:26:51,661 --> 00:26:54,789
- "Kashmir"?
- Is that your idea of making a contribution?

356
00:26:54,789 --> 00:26:58,334
- We hadn't even started yet.
- We were this close to losing that.

357
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:02,714
Okay, I don't even understand what
happened in there. What did I say?

358
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:05,321
- You called his niece a whore.
- A cheap one.

359
00:27:05,425 --> 00:27:07,927
- She's 7.
- Confined to bed with a case of --

360
00:27:08,032 --> 00:27:10,430
- No, don't tell him about it.
- I'm sorry.

361
00:27:10,951 --> 00:27:14,079
Okay. So, what does this mean?

362
00:27:14,184 --> 00:27:16,061
It means you stay here.

363
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:24,715
The mark's name is van der Woude.
A semi-known, wealthy recluse.

364
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:27,843
He claims to sell antiques,
but hasn't actually sold one.

365
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:31,380
His store is his privately owned home,
which no one ever enters.

366
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:34,300
But don't let van der Woude's
eccentricity fool you.

367
00:27:34,404 --> 00:27:37,741
The house is extremely well-protected.

368
00:27:56,197 --> 00:27:58,178
- What are we after?
- It's a document.

369
00:27:58,178 --> 00:28:00,368
It's a very old, very valuable document.

370
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:02,870
- Yeah, what is it?
- A stock certificate.

371
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:06,624
The first one ever issued
from the first corporation on the planet.

372
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:08,814
Dutch East India Trading Company.

373
00:28:08,918 --> 00:28:11,316
- The only one of its kind.
- What's the take?

374
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,089
2.5 million euro.

375
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,278
Wait. Each?

376
00:28:15,383 --> 00:28:18,094
- No.
- Who negotiated this?

377
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:22,056
- That's a lot of money to a lot of people.
- Are you out of your mind?

378
00:28:22,056 --> 00:28:26,018
If we do one job a week at that rate,
we won't pay Benedict off until ...

379
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:28,834
- September 2005.
- Jesus Christ, Danny.

380
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:31,232
I hear you, but it's what's available.

381
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,005
After we pull this job off ...

382
00:28:33,005 --> 00:28:36,758
Matsui's gonna throw us another.
It's gonna pay 10 times this one.

383
00:28:36,758 --> 00:28:39,678
- Which will buy an extension from Benedict.
- You hope.

384
00:28:39,782 --> 00:28:44,266
I hope. Now, the good news is that
Matsui gave us the system's master code.

385
00:28:44,266 --> 00:28:46,873
- So, what are we waiting for?
- Van der Woude.

386
00:28:46,873 --> 00:28:48,958
- That's the bad news.
- He never leaves.

387
00:28:49,062 --> 00:28:51,982
- He's agoraphobic.
- He's never been out of his house?

388
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:55,631
- Not in 10 years since he moved in.
- Does he believe in fresh air?

389
00:28:55,736 --> 00:28:58,342
- He opens his window.
- What does that mean?

390
00:28:58,447 --> 00:29:00,741
- Best time of arrival.
- Means he opens his window.

391
00:29:00,845 --> 00:29:03,973
Every night at 1:30 he takes an Ambien,
puts on Beethoven's Third.

392
00:29:03,973 --> 00:29:08,144
By the fourth movement, he's out
like a light. So we go in at 3 a.m.

393
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:11,368
Okay, can we tap into the system
from the phone lines?

394
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:16,373
It's a closed-loop system with two servers
locked in titanium cases next to his bed.

395
00:29:16,373 --> 00:29:18,667
- So hacking in is out.
- Look at this.

396
00:29:18,771 --> 00:29:21,691
Telephone-repair truck,
basket up to the second floor.

397
00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:25,132
Telescoping rod through the window,
tap out the freak's code.

398
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:28,990
- Dumb idea. One lane, one-way streets.
- Dumb idea.

399
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,805
All right? Any stoppage will bring cops.

400
00:29:31,805 --> 00:29:35,038
The outside is covered
by five surveillance cameras.

401
00:29:35,038 --> 00:29:37,644
Monitored 24 hours a day
by a security company.

402
00:29:37,644 --> 00:29:40,460
He's got five exterior cameras?

403
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,337
- This guy is a freak.
- Super freak.

404
00:29:42,441 --> 00:29:44,109
What about through the roof?

405
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:48,072
- Two more cameras, pressure sensors --
- A laser net over the trap door --

406
00:29:48,072 --> 00:29:49,636
- Smoke the freak out.
- Yeah.

407
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,138
- Smoke the freak out.
- Hey!

408
00:29:52,242 --> 00:29:54,119
- What?
- Do we have to use that term?

409
00:29:54,224 --> 00:29:56,830
- What term?
- "Freak."

410
00:29:58,603 --> 00:30:02,670
The National Institute of Mental Health
estimates 5.6 percent of adults ...

411
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:05,276
develop "agraphoriaphobia."
- Agoraphobia.

412
00:30:05,381 --> 00:30:08,509
Whatever. I'm just saying,
I mean, do we ...?

413
00:30:08,717 --> 00:30:11,950
We don't need to be an
organization that labels people.

414
00:30:12,054 --> 00:30:14,244
Oh, now we're an organization?

415
00:30:14,244 --> 00:30:16,225
You'd call Emily Dickinson a freak?

416
00:30:16,329 --> 00:30:19,874
- Are you hosting a telethon?
- Who's Emily Dickinson?

417
00:30:19,874 --> 00:30:24,879
Am I the only one who feels funny
about stealing from a ...?

418
00:30:24,879 --> 00:30:26,965
You know, a handicapped guy?

419
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:29,988
- Well, I don't care.
- Hell, yeah.

420
00:30:29,988 --> 00:30:32,491
I feel funny about other things.

421
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:34,159
Cool.

422
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,723
But ...

423
00:30:35,932 --> 00:30:37,392
- Yeah?
- But ...

424
00:30:37,496 --> 00:30:38,747
- Right.
- What?

425
00:30:38,956 --> 00:30:41,980
- Ahab with a piggyback. Livingston?
- I can get anything.

426
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,544
- It's done.
- Ahab with what?

427
00:30:43,752 --> 00:30:46,046
- Boys.
- You're making that up. That's --

428
00:30:46,046 --> 00:30:49,800
That whole "Ahab with a piggyback,"
that's not real?

429
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,086
- Let me in.
- How do you think it feels ...

430
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,527
when someone bangs on the door?
- I gotta go to the toilet.

431
00:30:55,735 --> 00:30:58,342
Otherwise, I'm gonna shit on your feet.
Come on.

432
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:35,254
Show me them specs.

433
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,430
I've been doing this since
I'm 12 years old. You're micromanaging.

434
00:31:44,534 --> 00:31:48,601
You gotta find people you can delegate to.
Otherwise, you'll never have a life.

435
00:31:48,601 --> 00:31:52,355
I don't want a life. I want the hotel
to run like a hotel should.

436
00:31:52,355 --> 00:31:53,919
Reuben.

437
00:31:54,127 --> 00:31:55,587
Yeah.

438
00:31:56,525 --> 00:31:58,089
Great.

439
00:31:58,089 --> 00:32:01,113
- Okay. Good.
- Maybe.

440
00:32:01,739 --> 00:32:03,824
Fantastic.

441
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,185
Remember in Miller's Crossing
where Turturro begs for his life?

442
00:32:10,185 --> 00:32:13,522
Sure. "Look into your heart."

443
00:32:13,522 --> 00:32:15,503
I cry every time.

444
00:32:15,815 --> 00:32:17,171
What?

445
00:32:17,275 --> 00:32:19,465
We have no line of sight.

446
00:32:20,925 --> 00:32:24,574
Our only possibility, the window.
We're three inches too high.

447
00:32:24,574 --> 00:32:26,868
There's no clear shot, even with Basher.

448
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:30,927
In the physical universe we occupy,
it cannot be done.

449
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,534
What about the guy
from the Bulgari job?

450
00:32:33,638 --> 00:32:36,036
- Nagel. Spoke with him.
- Anything?

451
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:38,956
Lot of ideas, none of them any good.

452
00:32:38,956 --> 00:32:41,354
He's pushing this new
holographic technology.

453
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:45,838
Really interesting stuff, though.
He can reproduce anything 3-D.

454
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:48,444
How about 97 million?

455
00:32:49,904 --> 00:32:51,572
We're forcing it.

456
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:54,075
Yeah, we're forcing it.

457
00:32:55,118 --> 00:32:57,412
- You know what we haven't thought of?
- What?

458
00:32:57,516 --> 00:32:59,288
We turn ourselves in.

459
00:32:59,288 --> 00:33:02,104
- What could Benedict do to us then?
- There you go.

460
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:05,440
Call the cops,
tell them we did the Bellagio job.

461
00:33:05,545 --> 00:33:08,673
They put us away for 20 years.
That'd teach him.

462
00:33:08,986 --> 00:33:10,654
I think Tess would stick around.

463
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,948
You look great in jumpsuits.

464
00:33:13,678 --> 00:33:15,242
Hey ...

465
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,744
how's the hotel business?
- Sucks.

466
00:33:17,849 --> 00:33:20,873
- How's East Haven?
- Sucks.

467
00:33:22,332 --> 00:33:24,105
I don't know.

468
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:28,901
Can't turn my brain off, you know.
It's me.

469
00:33:29,736 --> 00:33:33,385
We go into some place,
and all I can do is see the angles.

470
00:33:33,385 --> 00:33:37,973
It's what I do. It's what
I've always done. I love it.

471
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,163
I don't know.

472
00:33:40,371 --> 00:33:42,769
Some sort of weird irony, you know?

473
00:33:42,978 --> 00:33:45,585
Tess watching me scratch and itch.

474
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:49,130
Hey, listen. You know,
the world's gone nuts and you're ...

475
00:33:51,424 --> 00:33:55,178
- What'd you wanna do?
- It's not attached to the adjacent buildings.

476
00:33:55,178 --> 00:33:57,993
- The whole house?
- We're just raising it slightly.

477
00:33:58,097 --> 00:34:01,121
Schumann did it in '64 in Venice
and '73 in Istanbul.

478
00:34:01,121 --> 00:34:03,728
- He only had a crew of six.
- We can't tilt a house.

479
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:07,482
- Did it with the Leaning Tower of Pizza.
- Exactly, thank you.

480
00:34:07,482 --> 00:34:10,915
- It took 300 men over two years to do it.
- There's 30 pylons.

481
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:13,730
We cut them, insert the jacks
and crank away.

482
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:17,067
It's really our best plan,
considering it's our only plan.

483
00:34:17,171 --> 00:34:21,655
- Crank for how long?
- Like I said, it's our only plan.

484
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:56,377
What?

485
00:34:58,984 --> 00:35:01,903
Oh, oh, okay, hold on.

486
00:35:09,619 --> 00:35:11,705
Try that.

487
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:06,856
Number five. I'm a go.

488
00:36:27,814 --> 00:36:33,341
Master thieves who practice the long con
live separate lives as civilians.

489
00:36:33,341 --> 00:36:35,843
They have legitimate jobs and families ...

490
00:36:35,843 --> 00:36:39,076
which make them
extremely difficult to catch.

491
00:36:39,806 --> 00:36:43,664
The greatest thief of all time was,
without question ...

492
00:36:43,664 --> 00:36:49,607
Gaspar LeMarc, who either died
in Portugal in 1988 ...

493
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:55,759
or in Hong Kong in 1996,
or he's still alive.

494
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,887
We may never know for certain,
because LeMarc ...

495
00:36:58,991 --> 00:37:02,119
was never captured or photographed ...

496
00:37:02,224 --> 00:37:06,186
despite being active for over 50 years.

497
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:10,148
Though he left behind a slew
of imitators ...

498
00:37:10,253 --> 00:37:15,153
only one is worth mentioning
in the same breath as LeMarc:

499
00:37:15,153 --> 00:37:19,220
The thief we know only
as the Night Fox.

500
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:23,808
So named for the small onyx figurines
he leaves behind to taunt us ...

501
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:28,709
the Night Fox must be considered
our number-one priority.

502
00:37:28,709 --> 00:37:34,123
His string of high-profile crimes are
an embarrassment to our branch ...

503
00:37:34,123 --> 00:37:36,729
to our entire profession.

504
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:42,881
We need more than traditional resources
to pursue thieves like the Night Fox.

505
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:49,450
We need to train ourselves to think the
way they think, to see what they see.

506
00:37:49,450 --> 00:37:52,370
And we should not allow ourselves
to be distracted --

507
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,707
I'm sorry. Someone just robbed
the van der Woude house.

508
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:57,375
What?

509
00:38:10,409 --> 00:38:13,954
Hi, Isabel. Well, we could really use
your help on this one.

510
00:38:14,163 --> 00:38:17,082
I hope the scene hasn't
been contaminated.

511
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,244
When can I speak to Mr. van der Woude?

512
00:38:33,244 --> 00:38:36,581
Probably tomorrow. He's heavily sedated.

513
00:38:36,581 --> 00:38:40,335
We can't figure out how they disabled
the alarm. Shorted it out somehow?

514
00:38:40,439 --> 00:38:44,714
No, that would have triggered the system
and damaged the circuits.

515
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:48,781
Well, then.
Then I don't know how they got in.

516
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,539
They had the code. Someone other than
the owner must have known it.

517
00:38:57,539 --> 00:39:01,085
Impossible. Van der Woude programmed
the last nine steps of the system.

518
00:39:01,085 --> 00:39:04,108
He set it and never left the house again.

519
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:08,279
Closed loop. Redundant servers.
Titanium encasement.

520
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:09,841
It's not bad, actually.

521
00:39:42,055 --> 00:39:45,496
Yeah. Thanks.

522
00:40:01,137 --> 00:40:02,596
Do we know each other?

523
00:40:04,265 --> 00:40:08,123
- I think I saw you yesterday.
- Oh, yeah?

524
00:40:08,123 --> 00:40:10,730
Yeah, you were being chased
by the police.

525
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:14,900
Chasing me? No. I don't think so.

526
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,924
I'm quite sure it was you.

527
00:40:18,029 --> 00:40:20,218
Doesn't say much for the police.

528
00:40:25,745 --> 00:40:27,309
No, I love Rome. I love it.

529
00:40:27,413 --> 00:40:31,271
But there's an opening at work
the level above me, and it's --

530
00:40:31,271 --> 00:40:34,712
I was thinking I was gonna try out for it.
It's in Amsterdam.

531
00:40:34,712 --> 00:40:39,404
My mother has family there, so it'd be --
It'd be good.

532
00:40:45,035 --> 00:40:48,163
- He lifted the whole house?
- The whole house.

533
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,345
- The entire house?
- The entire house.

534
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,639
It's called a Schumann Special ...

535
00:40:52,743 --> 00:40:57,018
named after this guy, a brilliant guy,
Max Schumann.

536
00:40:57,331 --> 00:41:02,023
Then he did it in Istanbul in 1973.

537
00:41:02,649 --> 00:41:04,317
What is it?

538
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:09,322
It's where the crossbow bolt hit.

539
00:41:12,867 --> 00:41:15,370
The crossbow bolt?

540
00:41:16,621 --> 00:41:20,062
They fired from that rooftop
through this open window.

541
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:23,398
With a crossbow bolt from that roof
through that window?

542
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,361
- That's a very difficult shot.
- No, it is an impossible shot ...

543
00:41:27,465 --> 00:41:29,550
until they raised the building.

544
00:41:29,759 --> 00:41:32,053
Check the pylons. They'll be elevated.

545
00:41:32,574 --> 00:41:35,598
- You know the name Max Schumann?
- No.

546
00:41:35,702 --> 00:41:38,101
- Well, they do.
- Who?

547
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,873
The Americans.

548
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,705
Wait a minute.

549
00:42:25,961 --> 00:42:30,332
Exactly. Why would they bring the drill
if they weren't planning to use it?

550
00:42:31,584 --> 00:42:34,503
- What?
- Oh, God.

551
00:42:48,476 --> 00:42:51,187
- What?
- I don't know.

552
00:43:03,073 --> 00:43:09,643
Congratulations. You are the second person
to crack the van der Woude safe tonight.

553
00:43:09,643 --> 00:43:13,188
In arriving second, Mr. Ocean,
you have joined a long line ...

554
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:19,653
of people who've worked hard and risked
a great deal only to get somewhere second.

555
00:43:20,487 --> 00:43:25,179
You don't know these people by name,
of course, because they enter oblivion.

556
00:43:25,179 --> 00:43:27,056
You know this word, "oblivion "?

557
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,435
It means to be totally forgotten
by everyone forever.

558
00:43:31,435 --> 00:43:35,606
And it's where you would be now
if it weren't for the Bellagio heist.

559
00:43:35,606 --> 00:43:37,691
How does this guy know who we are?

560
00:43:37,796 --> 00:43:42,384
In a way, I'm responsible for you
coming to Amsterdam in the first place.

561
00:43:42,384 --> 00:43:45,512
I hired Matsui, and Matsui hired you.

562
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,910
That's the guy who dimed us
to Benedict.

563
00:43:49,266 --> 00:43:51,455
- All of them, including Ocean.
- Yes.

564
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:56,877
I find that hard to believe.
And you are?

565
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:58,963
You can call me the Night Fox.

566
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:02,508
The Night Fox. Okay, Mr. Night Fox.

567
00:44:02,508 --> 00:44:05,740
- What will this information cost me?
- Don't worry. Nothing.

568
00:44:05,845 --> 00:44:09,906
Nothing? Who do you think you're
dealing with? Nothing costs nothing.

569
00:44:09,906 --> 00:44:12,718
And this information is definitely
worth something.

570
00:44:12,823 --> 00:44:16,785
Let's just say our interests
are temporarily aligned.

571
00:44:16,785 --> 00:44:18,558
How so?

572
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:22,416
Well, the information is free,
but it comes with certain conditions.

573
00:44:22,416 --> 00:44:25,752
- Such as?
- Restraint on your part.

574
00:44:25,857 --> 00:44:29,819
Restraint? That's asking a lot.
What else?

575
00:44:29,819 --> 00:44:32,426
Two weeks to buy themselves
out of trouble.

576
00:44:32,426 --> 00:44:34,198
Two weeks?

577
00:44:34,615 --> 00:44:38,056
I can live with that, even if they can't.

578
00:44:38,265 --> 00:44:42,644
Just out of curiosity,
what will you make them pay?

579
00:44:42,644 --> 00:44:47,858
For letting them live?
Everything they stole, plus interest.

580
00:44:48,379 --> 00:44:50,152
A lot of interest.

581
00:44:50,465 --> 00:44:53,488
But didn't your insurance
cover what was stolen?

582
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:55,261
Of course.

583
00:44:55,470 --> 00:44:58,181
So you're asking them to double
your money?

584
00:44:58,181 --> 00:45:00,162
Well, do you really think that's fair?

585
00:45:00,370 --> 00:45:04,958
Fair? I certainly hope not.
So, what about the information?

586
00:45:05,584 --> 00:45:08,191
Okay. It's on your desk.

587
00:45:11,006 --> 00:45:15,281
He was here.
Around 3:30 this morning. I can tell.

588
00:45:15,281 --> 00:45:17,366
- Who?
- The Night Fox.

589
00:45:19,973 --> 00:45:23,310
Go down to the Dampkring
and pick up a guy called Matsui.

590
00:45:23,310 --> 00:45:25,395
Real name, Ian Nicolas McNally.

591
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,296
The Night Fox was here at the same time
as the Americans? Why?

592
00:45:30,296 --> 00:45:33,424
That's what we're gonna find out.

593
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:39,889
What is he doing?

594
00:45:40,723 --> 00:45:43,121
Get him out of there.

595
00:45:44,581 --> 00:45:46,667
God.

596
00:46:46,197 --> 00:46:48,491
Hello, Frank.

597
00:46:48,596 --> 00:46:50,994
I can't understand what we did
to this guy.

598
00:46:51,098 --> 00:46:54,956
- Why does he have it out for us like this?
- How did he get that code?

599
00:46:54,956 --> 00:46:58,397
Doesn't matter. He broke rule
number one. He's on the list.

600
00:46:58,397 --> 00:47:00,065
Great time for a turf war.

601
00:47:00,274 --> 00:47:04,966
I spoke with Frank's associate in Dublin.
She's trying to get us a name on this guy.

602
00:47:04,966 --> 00:47:07,781
Our train leaves tomorrow at 1:38, okay?

603
00:47:07,781 --> 00:47:09,971
- Where is Frank?
- I don't know.

604
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:15,706
It's gonna get out. Then we'll be dead,
and no one will wanna work with us.

605
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:18,208
Housekeeping.

606
00:47:29,053 --> 00:47:31,964
Turndown service for Mr. Ryan.

607
00:47:41,036 --> 00:47:43,017
Hi.

608
00:47:47,918 --> 00:47:50,212
Nice room.

609
00:47:50,316 --> 00:47:53,027
You have it all to yourself?

610
00:47:55,217 --> 00:47:57,615
You here to take me in?

611
00:47:58,032 --> 00:48:03,141
Why would I do that?
It's not as if you stole something.

612
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:07,521
It's nice to see you again, Robert.

613
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,397
You too.

614
00:48:09,606 --> 00:48:14,715
Of course, you've been seeing
plenty of me, haven't you?

615
00:48:17,114 --> 00:48:19,199
I like this one.

616
00:48:19,825 --> 00:48:22,431
I call it "thief à la mode."

617
00:48:29,626 --> 00:48:32,233
Schumann Special, huh?

618
00:48:32,963 --> 00:48:36,299
I guess that's what I get
for opening my mouth.

619
00:48:36,299 --> 00:48:39,323
So, what about the Night Fox?

620
00:48:39,428 --> 00:48:41,721
Did he leave you a message?

621
00:48:42,868 --> 00:48:45,371
What about the figurine?
You still have it?

622
00:48:49,333 --> 00:48:52,253
I suppose it's a compliment in a way.

623
00:48:52,357 --> 00:48:57,883
I guess he's threatened by you,
though I can't imagine why.

624
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:02,471
You have no idea what you're up against.

625
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:05,182
The French police
think he's better than LeMarc.

626
00:49:05,287 --> 00:49:07,476
Well, he is French.

627
00:49:07,789 --> 00:49:10,075
Let me give you some advice.

628
00:49:10,179 --> 00:49:15,393
Find out how you offended him.
Apologize. Beg for mercy.

629
00:49:18,104 --> 00:49:20,085
Got to go.

630
00:49:20,607 --> 00:49:26,133
Any message for Frank?
He's been hanging around the station.

631
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:28,010
On what charge?

632
00:49:28,114 --> 00:49:33,432
Well, we found a print of a size 14
Hi-Tec Magnum boot at the crime scene.

633
00:49:33,432 --> 00:49:35,309
And?

634
00:49:35,413 --> 00:49:37,811
Bought with a fraudulent credit card.

635
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:44,068
From that point on, well, there's only one,
maybe two great nail salons in Amsterdam.

636
00:50:01,585 --> 00:50:03,983
- And you lied to us.
- Yeah, and to me.

637
00:50:05,964 --> 00:50:07,841
Well, Frank knew.

638
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:11,074
- Frank knew you were in touch?
- I wasn't in touch.

639
00:50:11,178 --> 00:50:13,368
I was more like keeping tabs.

640
00:50:13,576 --> 00:50:16,391
- She's a cop!
- Detective, actually.

641
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,207
- Where'd she learn all that Schumann crap?
- Dad.

642
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:20,875
- What, he was a cop?
- Thief.

643
00:50:21,084 --> 00:50:23,273
- Oh, God. Was he good?
- Oh, yeah.

644
00:50:23,378 --> 00:50:27,444
Great. Pissed-off ex-girlfriend
whose thief father ...

645
00:50:27,444 --> 00:50:29,634
taught her every trick in the book.

646
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:31,719
Well, she just made Danny and Yen.

647
00:50:31,824 --> 00:50:35,890
In the next 48 hours, your pictures
will be in every police station.

648
00:50:35,890 --> 00:50:38,810
- Nobody looks at them.
- Nobody but cops.

649
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:41,729
- Detectives.
- You'd think she'd have sympathy for us ...

650
00:50:41,729 --> 00:50:45,692
if her old man was a thief.
- Is that sympathy or empathy?

651
00:50:45,692 --> 00:50:49,758
No, her old man got popped a day
before her 9th birthday. Died in jail.

652
00:50:49,858 --> 00:50:53,608
So I wouldn't count on much sympathy.
Or empathy.

653
00:50:53,712 --> 00:50:56,215
She's gonna have the hotel
under surveillance.

654
00:50:56,736 --> 00:51:01,116
Great. We'll just eat room service, watch
movies and wait for Benedict to kill us.

655
00:51:01,116 --> 00:51:02,888
- Who's on the $100 bill?
- Adams.

656
00:51:02,993 --> 00:51:05,182
- John Travolta.
- He said every problem ...

657
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:07,163
is an opportunity in disguise.

658
00:51:07,372 --> 00:51:09,770
He couldn't say that
with a .45 in his mouth.

659
00:51:09,874 --> 00:51:12,168
No, you're missing the silver lining here.

660
00:51:12,273 --> 00:51:16,339
Now, she gave us a name, didn't she?
The Night Fox.

661
00:51:16,444 --> 00:51:20,823
One phone call, we're gonna find out
everything there is to know about this guy.

662
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:53,408
The name is M. Diaz.
D-l-A-Z.

663
00:52:54,033 --> 00:52:56,640
It's a black duffel bag.

664
00:52:57,891 --> 00:53:01,019
The team's in Rotterdam.
The bag's in Brussels.

665
00:53:01,124 --> 00:53:05,711
He's the modern man:
disconnected, frightened ...

666
00:53:05,711 --> 00:53:08,527
paranoid, but with good reason.

667
00:53:08,631 --> 00:53:12,281
It's too sad to be funny.
Unusable.

668
00:53:12,698 --> 00:53:15,200
- I think I can get 20 minutes out of it.
- Great.

669
00:53:15,304 --> 00:53:19,058
I got it. The team's in Barcelona.
The bag's in Madrid.

670
00:53:20,101 --> 00:53:23,020
This is a moral issue
we're dealing with here.

671
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:27,087
And we don't have a grease man anymore,
because he's in a bag somewhere.

672
00:53:27,087 --> 00:53:28,651
We got a bag man.

673
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:31,258
Such an ape. An animal with no feelings.

674
00:53:31,362 --> 00:53:33,343
- I have feelings.
- No, you don't.

675
00:53:33,448 --> 00:53:37,410
I feel bad for the guy. He's in a piece
of luggage, but he's got water.

676
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:40,329
- What did you want them to do?
- Get off the bus.

677
00:53:40,329 --> 00:53:42,728
And pick up the bag
with our friend in it.

678
00:53:42,936 --> 00:53:45,960
How many pro soccer teams
are fielding 50-year-old men?

679
00:53:46,064 --> 00:53:48,150
Rusty's not 50 years old.

680
00:53:49,714 --> 00:53:52,529
Yeah, dude, we know Rusty's not 50.

681
00:53:53,155 --> 00:53:56,387
You think I'm 50 years old?
Let me ask you something.

682
00:53:56,491 --> 00:53:58,473
No, wait, let me ask you something.

683
00:53:58,577 --> 00:54:00,767
How old do you think I am?

684
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:02,643
Forty-eight.

685
00:54:04,207 --> 00:54:06,710
You think I'm 48 years old?

686
00:54:07,544 --> 00:54:09,936
Fifty-two?

687
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:18,276
- Maybe he should've asked me.
- Nobody should ever ask you anything.

688
00:54:18,485 --> 00:54:22,551
That guy doesn't have a hard enough
life right now? You gotta --

689
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:25,679
You're gonna defend him?
They put Yen in a handbag.

690
00:54:27,035 --> 00:54:30,684
- Can I ask you something? Ever notice --?
- lf you're gonna ask a question ...

691
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:33,500
give me time to respond,
unless it's rhetorical ...

692
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,898
in which case the answer
is obvious: yes.

693
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:37,358
- Okay, can I ask --?
- Yes.

694
00:54:37,566 --> 00:54:41,737
- You ever notice that Tess looks exactly --?
- Don't ever ask that. Seriously.

695
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:45,282
- Not to anyone. Especially not to her.
- Wait. Why not?

696
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,263
Look.

697
00:54:47,368 --> 00:54:49,870
It's not in my nature to be mysterious ...

698
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:53,937
but I can't talk about it,
and I can't talk about why.

699
00:55:00,402 --> 00:55:03,425
- Can I ask you --? Do I look 50 to you?
- Yeah.

700
00:55:03,530 --> 00:55:09,577
- Really?
- Well, I mean, only from the neck up.

701
00:56:04,937 --> 00:56:07,023
Saul?

702
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:09,317
What's the matter?

703
00:56:10,359 --> 00:56:12,236
Nothing.

704
00:56:14,426 --> 00:56:16,824
You wanna go out? It's nice.

705
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,431
No.

706
00:56:20,161 --> 00:56:22,559
You wanna watch something?
The game's on.

707
00:56:22,663 --> 00:56:24,957
No.

708
00:56:25,062 --> 00:56:29,337
- You hungry? I'll heat something up.
- No.

709
00:56:30,484 --> 00:56:35,384
Saul, ever since you got back,
you've been acting strange.

710
00:56:35,906 --> 00:56:38,617
What did Danny want?

711
00:56:39,242 --> 00:56:40,806
Nothing.

712
00:56:40,911 --> 00:56:44,039
Nothing? How could he want nothing?

713
00:56:57,594 --> 00:57:01,139
All right, the Night Fox has a name.
François Toulour.

714
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:03,433
Baron François Toulour.

715
00:57:03,538 --> 00:57:06,978
Father was a French industrialist,
mother was Italian nobility.

716
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:09,898
He never met her,
but he inherited her title.

717
00:57:10,002 --> 00:57:13,965
The bad news is he's rich, he's bored
and he's talented.

718
00:57:13,965 --> 00:57:17,614
The really bad news is he was trained
by LeMarc.

719
00:57:17,614 --> 00:57:21,264
- This is not good.
- With the LeMarc? Gaspar LeMarc?

720
00:57:21,368 --> 00:57:23,140
That's the one.

721
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:25,434
- Well, we're doomed.
- We're not doomed.

722
00:57:25,434 --> 00:57:27,624
- He's one guy, and he's French.
- Yeah.

723
00:57:27,728 --> 00:57:30,327
Before we get too impressed
by his background ...

724
00:57:30,431 --> 00:57:33,455
let's hear what he's done.
- He started in the '90s.

725
00:57:33,455 --> 00:57:37,418
Bank of Geneva, the Danish Treasury,
the Bank of Italy, AMC Amro ...

726
00:57:37,418 --> 00:57:40,546
the Brussels Diamond Exchange,
Antwerp Diamond Exchange.

727
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:44,299
- Wait, wait. All those in the 1990s?
- I'm only up to '96.

728
00:57:44,299 --> 00:57:47,010
- Seriously?
- In '97, he went through an art phase.

729
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:51,286
He hit the Tate in London, the Louvre
in Paris, twice, and the Prado.

730
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:54,935
Wait. No, no, hang on. The Prado Museum
in '97? That was Moretti.

731
00:57:54,935 --> 00:57:58,480
- Everybody knows that --
- He is Moretti. It's one of his aliases.

732
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,338
Okay, I'll skip to my favorite.

733
00:58:02,338 --> 00:58:08,699
In 2002, he stole the king of Morocco's
200-foot yacht. Vanished into thin air.

734
00:58:08,699 --> 00:58:12,348
Crew surfaced days later in a life raft.
Couldn't remember a thing.

735
00:58:12,453 --> 00:58:16,415
- How do you hide a 200-foot yacht?
- lf the king knows, he's not telling.

736
00:58:16,415 --> 00:58:20,586
He got it back a month later. He now plays
tennis with Toulour every weekend.

737
00:58:20,690 --> 00:58:24,027
- We're in some serious trouble here.
- Copy that.

738
00:58:24,027 --> 00:58:26,633
- So, what do we do?
- We respond.

739
00:58:26,738 --> 00:58:31,117
- Respond? How?
- In kind.

740
00:58:54,474 --> 00:58:55,934
Mr. Ocean.

741
00:58:56,038 --> 00:58:59,687
You broke rule number one,
and that has consequences.

742
00:58:59,687 --> 00:59:02,503
Oh, you must be talking about
the paintings.

743
00:59:02,503 --> 00:59:07,091
Don't worry. You'll be dead in five days,
and I'll get my paintings back.

744
00:59:07,091 --> 00:59:11,045
- Unless you have an accident first.
- I don't think so, Daniel.

745
00:59:11,253 --> 00:59:14,382
Perhaps I should explain to you
why I'm tormenting you.

746
00:59:14,486 --> 00:59:16,780
I'd like that.

747
00:59:16,884 --> 00:59:19,908
Last month I was in Portugal
to see my mentor.

748
00:59:19,908 --> 00:59:21,472
- LeMarc.
- Indeed.

749
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:27,624
A very loud and annoying American
businessman was there the same day.

750
00:59:28,771 --> 00:59:31,169
He worked for a big insurance company.

751
00:59:31,273 --> 00:59:34,923
He's the one who suggested Benedict
to you as a potential mark.

752
00:59:34,923 --> 00:59:37,321
- You know the man?
- What about him?

753
00:59:37,425 --> 00:59:40,762
He said it was the most
beautiful job he'd ever seen.

754
00:59:40,762 --> 00:59:44,307
He went on and on about this job,
and then he said ...

755
00:59:44,307 --> 00:59:47,331
it showed you were the greatest
thief in the world.

756
00:59:47,435 --> 00:59:51,606
But the worst part is that LeMarc
never corrected him.

757
00:59:55,673 --> 01:00:00,469
I told LeMarc that you can't be
better than me.

758
01:00:00,469 --> 01:00:04,744
And he answered that it was impossible
to know for sure.

759
01:00:04,744 --> 01:00:10,792
So I thought about that for, like,
three weeks in a row, day and night.

760
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:16,006
And then suddenly, I realized that
he was actually right.

761
01:00:16,006 --> 01:00:19,655
It is impossible to compare one theft
to the other.

762
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:26,641
So I guess the only way to know
who's the best of us for sure ...

763
01:00:26,641 --> 01:00:30,082
is to go after the same object.
Do the same job.

764
01:00:30,082 --> 01:00:33,419
Don't you think that would be fun?

765
01:00:34,045 --> 01:00:39,050
You're being awfully cavalier with a lot of
people's lives so you can play out a game.

766
01:00:40,509 --> 01:00:42,595
You're gonna regret it.

767
01:00:43,220 --> 01:00:46,036
Come on, Mr. Ocean.

768
01:00:46,453 --> 01:00:50,407
How are you gonna possibly get
$97 million by next Wednesday?

769
01:00:50,407 --> 01:00:55,621
Especially if every safe you crack
between now and then is already empty?

770
01:00:55,621 --> 01:00:58,019
Whereas if you accept my challenge
and win ...

771
01:00:58,123 --> 01:01:00,730
I promise I'll pay your debt
to Benedict ...

772
01:01:00,834 --> 01:01:04,796
and LeMarc will hold my money
in escrow as a guarantee.

773
01:01:11,783 --> 01:01:13,972
What are we stealing?

774
01:01:15,745 --> 01:01:18,143
The famous Fabergé Coronation Egg.

775
01:01:18,143 --> 01:01:21,584
- Was that your idea or LeMarc's?
- I think he would agree ...

776
01:01:21,584 --> 01:01:24,921
that it's the most appropriate thing
for us to compete over.

777
01:01:24,921 --> 01:01:26,902
Where is it located?

778
01:01:27,006 --> 01:01:30,343
The egg left Paris this morning
on its way to Rome.

779
01:01:30,447 --> 01:01:35,139
It travels with heavy security and usually
with one or more replicas.

780
01:01:35,139 --> 01:01:39,623
Sometimes they even show the replicas
without anybody knowing.

781
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:42,543
When the egg goes on display
Monday morning ...

782
01:01:42,647 --> 01:01:46,818
you'll have 48 hours to steal it
before your deadline's up.

783
01:01:46,818 --> 01:01:50,259
When the deadline passes
and you don't have the egg ...

784
01:01:50,259 --> 01:01:53,595
LeMarc will know who's the best.

785
01:02:09,757 --> 01:02:12,885
- Rusty's phone.
- Who is this?

786
01:02:12,885 --> 01:02:15,284
Nicole. Who's this?

787
01:02:15,388 --> 01:02:18,307
Nagel. Where's Rusty?

788
01:02:18,412 --> 01:02:22,270
He said if you called,
to say he was at Gunther's.

789
01:02:22,270 --> 01:02:25,502
Gunther's? What's that about?
Did he say something?

790
01:02:25,606 --> 01:02:27,170
Do you have a message?

791
01:02:27,275 --> 01:02:31,125
Yes, I do. Tell him this thing is gonna
cost him double what I told him.

792
01:02:31,125 --> 01:02:34,983
And tell him I had to go three times
as thin on the layers.

793
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:40,196
And tell him if he wants it tomorrow,
it should cost him more than double.

794
01:02:41,031 --> 01:02:43,533
And tell him this thing is beautiful.

795
01:02:43,637 --> 01:02:46,661
Would fool the bloody Romanovs
themselves.

796
01:02:47,183 --> 01:02:51,979
And tell him I'm being a nice guy.
And tell him he dresses like a gigolo.

797
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:53,856
Is that it?

798
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:59,069
Yeah. No. Tell him having
a sexy female assistant ...

799
01:02:59,069 --> 01:03:02,719
is such a terrible cliché.

800
01:03:13,146 --> 01:03:15,857
Can I get a coffee or something?

801
01:03:16,691 --> 01:03:20,236
Thanks. Just a cappuccino or espresso.

802
01:03:22,947 --> 01:03:24,303
Well ...

803
01:03:33,479 --> 01:03:36,711
You call me on Saturday
and ask me to come into my office ...

804
01:03:36,711 --> 01:03:38,901
and sign a 1077 ...

805
01:03:39,005 --> 01:03:42,238
and you can't even tell me
what they are after?

806
01:03:42,238 --> 01:03:45,574
- I can come to your house.
- I'm leaving for Naples in two hours.

807
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:49,224
- We'll talk about this on Wednesday.
- It'll be gone by Wednesday.

808
01:03:49,224 --> 01:03:53,290
- What? What? What will be gone?
- Something worth signing a 1077 for.

809
01:03:53,290 --> 01:03:57,148
Ryan and his friends
did the Bellagio casino heist in 2001.

810
01:03:57,148 --> 01:04:00,276
- I am telling you, this is serious --
- If that's true ...

811
01:04:00,381 --> 01:04:03,926
then we should call the American FBI --
- No, no, no.

812
01:04:03,926 --> 01:04:06,846
- Maurizio, listen to me.
- Agent Lahiri ...

813
01:04:06,846 --> 01:04:10,487
a 1077 is not a small thing.

814
01:04:10,487 --> 01:04:15,701
Unless you can tell me what they are after,
there is no point in discussing it.

815
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,101
Hey --

816
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:09,087
Because LeMarc stole it in 1980
when 23 others failed.

817
01:05:09,087 --> 01:05:13,779
Because the Night Fox is trying to prove
he's better than Ryan and his friends.

818
01:05:15,239 --> 01:05:19,514
This is ridiculous.
You say the egg will be stolen.

819
01:05:19,514 --> 01:05:23,894
Then you say LeMarc already stole it
24 years ago.

820
01:05:24,102 --> 01:05:27,439
- Which one is it?
- Both.

821
01:05:27,439 --> 01:05:29,316
What?

822
01:05:29,837 --> 01:05:32,548
LeMarc's wife made him
put the egg back.

823
01:05:36,928 --> 01:05:41,620
When I signed a 1077 for you
on the Bulgari case ...

824
01:05:41,620 --> 01:05:47,980
you requisitioned 30 of my men
for three months and made zero arrests.

825
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:53,394
I won't do it again.

826
01:05:56,835 --> 01:05:58,504
First, we cannot go at night.

827
01:05:58,712 --> 01:06:01,528
The laser grid in the Great Hall's
impossible to beat.

828
01:06:01,528 --> 01:06:04,239
- Nothing's impossible.
- This is impossible.

829
01:06:04,343 --> 01:06:07,575
It's in constant motion, programmed
to improvise randomly ...

830
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,869
meaning we can't
plan our way through.

831
01:06:09,973 --> 01:06:11,225
All right.

832
01:06:11,329 --> 01:06:12,685
So it's a daytime play.

833
01:06:12,893 --> 01:06:18,107
We're still short three on the inside
since Isabel made you and Yen and Danny.

834
01:06:18,107 --> 01:06:20,505
We could try a Smuggler's Paradise.

835
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:23,633
- It hasn't worked since the '50s.
- '54, actually.

836
01:06:23,633 --> 01:06:25,197
What's option two?

837
01:06:25,406 --> 01:06:28,534
Baby Jane, Squeaky Wheel,
followed by a Number-Two Son.

838
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:32,496
It's complicated, but it's got a high
success rate. The only problem is --

839
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,250
We can't do it without a grease man
on the inside, without Yen.

840
01:06:37,814 --> 01:06:41,463
We'll have to risk it.
We'll put him in disguise.

841
01:06:42,923 --> 01:06:45,634
10:10, I leave the café,
proceed west. 10:11?

842
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:50,535
- I enter the second-floor bathroom.
- 10:13?

843
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:52,829
Approach the Spanish Steps
from the south.

844
01:06:52,933 --> 01:06:55,227
Basher and I enter by the main entrance.

845
01:06:55,227 --> 01:06:58,147
- 10:15?
- I help Yen into the ventilation duct.

846
01:06:58,251 --> 01:07:00,649
- 10:18?
- I move Reuben to the Egg Room.

847
01:07:00,753 --> 01:07:03,673
- I pause in the Great Hall while --
- I go to the Egg Room.

848
01:07:03,777 --> 01:07:05,863
- 10:21?
- Yen enters the mainframe room.

849
01:07:05,967 --> 01:07:09,512
He cuts power to grid 14-A.
He radios me. I signal Linus.

850
01:07:09,616 --> 01:07:11,493
- I then go to the Egg Room.
- 10:22?

851
01:07:11,598 --> 01:07:13,892
I drop my keys and move Reuben
to his mark.

852
01:07:13,996 --> 01:07:17,124
- I blind camera one.
- I blind camera two.

853
01:07:17,124 --> 01:07:19,209
- I blind camera three.
- Camera four.

854
01:07:19,418 --> 01:07:20,773
- I make the switch.
- Right.

855
01:07:20,878 --> 01:07:24,527
- 10:24?
- I pull to the corner of the main entrance.

856
01:07:24,527 --> 01:07:27,238
I meet Danny at the Steps.
We head north. 10:25?

857
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:28,802
Turk and I make the drop.

858
01:07:28,907 --> 01:07:31,193
All right. Really good stuff, guys.

859
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:35,363
Really good work. All right,
we'll pick it up here in an hour.

860
01:07:35,363 --> 01:07:37,449
It's a slam-dunk.

861
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,577
- Great.
- 10:45, we all get arrested.

862
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,141
You bet.

863
01:07:42,141 --> 01:07:44,644
- How was Toulour?
- He was predictable.

864
01:07:44,748 --> 01:07:47,042
You hear from Nagel?

865
01:07:47,146 --> 01:07:48,606
He'll be here.

866
01:07:48,814 --> 01:07:51,317
That's a lot to presume
from a guy like Nagel.

867
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:52,985
Follow it up.

868
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,431
This is Isabel.

869
01:08:01,431 --> 01:08:05,185
It's Johan. I just set a 6:00 meeting
for you with an Andre Ciment ...

870
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:10,190
who says he had four paintings stolen
from his house in Lake Como.

871
01:08:10,190 --> 01:08:12,275
- And when was this?
- Sometime Friday.

872
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:14,986
He's missing two Monets,
a Turner and a Degas.

873
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:17,489
- Which Degas was it?
- Blue Dancers.

874
01:08:17,593 --> 01:08:22,494
Supposedly, there's surveillance video,
but I haven't been able to confirm that yet.

875
01:08:22,494 --> 01:08:24,892
It is all about error correction.

876
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:29,897
Three thousand separate,
translucent, digital slivers ...

877
01:08:29,897 --> 01:08:33,129
instead of the 1,000
I thought it would be.

878
01:08:33,129 --> 01:08:35,632
Thank God it doesn't have to move.

879
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:42,827
Re-creating the lighting was a pain.
It's a mixture of tungsten and real light.

880
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:46,059
But I think the color rendition
is pretty damn accurate.

881
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:50,334
Batteries are in the base.
Two minutes maximum.

882
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:51,898
You're good.

883
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:55,235
- It's good, Roman. You're a genius.
- I think I am.

884
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:59,197
You'd have never got past that grid.

885
01:08:59,301 --> 01:09:01,178
That's why you're paying me double.

886
01:09:01,283 --> 01:09:03,472
- What? No, no, no.
- You got my message.

887
01:09:03,577 --> 01:09:07,226
- Who's that sexy phone voice? Early Bond.
- What message?

888
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:10,346
The message I left with
Sexy Phone Voice Nicole.

889
01:09:10,346 --> 01:09:12,015
On your mobile.

890
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:15,351
Got something going
with Gunther? Am I in?

891
01:09:15,455 --> 01:09:19,835
- Okay, when did you leave the message?
- Two days ago.

892
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:22,025
She had your phone.

893
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:25,570
- She has your --?
- Yeah.

894
01:09:28,072 --> 01:09:29,949
- That means that she's --?
- Yeah.

895
01:09:31,096 --> 01:09:33,077
- Well, you better --
- Yeah.

896
01:09:34,954 --> 01:09:36,414
- That's great.
- I mean ...

897
01:09:36,518 --> 01:09:41,106
So --? So who's got my money?

898
01:09:43,504 --> 01:09:47,258
Who has got my bloody money?

899
01:10:07,799 --> 01:10:09,572
Jesus.

900
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:23,544
Sorry to hear about your mom.

901
01:10:24,483 --> 01:10:26,673
She was an amazing ...

902
01:10:27,611 --> 01:10:29,175
Well, I thought so, at least.

903
01:10:29,488 --> 01:10:33,033
She hated you.
I should've picked up on that.

904
01:10:33,033 --> 01:10:35,536
- She hated all thieves.
- No wonder you fought.

905
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:36,995
Excuse me?

906
01:10:37,204 --> 01:10:39,602
- May I have my phone back?
- No.

907
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,128
- That's a nice pull, by the way.
- Thanks.

908
01:10:45,128 --> 01:10:48,987
Did you get that tingling sensation
down your spine when you did it?

909
01:10:49,091 --> 01:10:51,481
Or is that none of my business?

910
01:10:54,088 --> 01:10:56,382
You considered a career change?

911
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:58,050
Have you?

912
01:11:00,865 --> 01:11:02,325
I tried hotels.

913
01:11:02,429 --> 01:11:03,889
I'm better at this.

914
01:11:08,686 --> 01:11:10,563
Went by the café for some tiramisu.

915
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:12,961
- It wasn't the same.
- Who's the Night Fox?

916
01:11:13,065 --> 01:11:16,923
- They did something to the eggs.
- Why accept his challenge?

917
01:11:17,862 --> 01:11:19,530
Because he'll lose.

918
01:11:19,634 --> 01:11:21,198
And how can you beat him?

919
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:22,762
We can't.

920
01:11:24,118 --> 01:11:26,099
You're not making any sense.

921
01:11:26,099 --> 01:11:27,767
Okay.

922
01:11:31,834 --> 01:11:36,422
The Bulgari job you pulled with Frank
when we were together ...

923
01:11:37,777 --> 01:11:39,029
I knew it was you.

924
01:11:42,470 --> 01:11:44,555
Why didn't you say something?

925
01:11:47,787 --> 01:11:49,664
Why didn't you ...

926
01:11:50,081 --> 01:11:51,645
Robert?

927
01:11:52,897 --> 01:11:54,982
I didn't want it to end.

928
01:11:58,214 --> 01:11:59,674
You assumed it would.

929
01:12:00,508 --> 01:12:02,385
Was I wrong?

930
01:12:04,366 --> 01:12:06,452
You shouldn't be here.

931
01:12:09,476 --> 01:12:11,144
I have a meeting.

932
01:12:11,248 --> 01:12:14,585
Someone stole a whole bunch
of paintings in Lake Como.

933
01:12:15,940 --> 01:12:18,964
Interesting. Any leads?

934
01:12:19,069 --> 01:12:20,528
The next time I see you ...

935
01:12:21,363 --> 01:12:23,239
I'm arresting you.

936
01:12:23,344 --> 01:12:27,723
And Ocean and anybody else I recognize.

937
01:12:28,662 --> 01:12:30,322
Fair enough.

938
01:13:27,462 --> 01:13:29,861
- Ready?
- Right.

939
01:13:47,170 --> 01:13:48,734
Yes, of course I do.

940
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:51,132
My Blue Dancers, my Degas.

941
01:13:51,236 --> 01:13:54,156
They took it, unfortunately,
and I really would like --

942
01:13:54,260 --> 01:13:56,137
Do you have any enemies?

943
01:13:56,241 --> 01:13:59,474
Anybody out there who would
feel wronged by you?

944
01:14:03,227 --> 01:14:05,521
No. I can't see anyone.

945
01:14:05,521 --> 01:14:08,232
But why? You think --
You think maybe the thief ...

946
01:14:08,232 --> 01:14:10,310
is trying to harm me personally now?

947
01:14:10,518 --> 01:14:13,438
Well, I assumed he was after
the paintings themselves.

948
01:14:13,438 --> 01:14:14,689
I think it's enough.

949
01:14:14,898 --> 01:14:16,149
Ready?

950
01:14:24,595 --> 01:14:26,055
Good?

951
01:14:28,244 --> 01:14:30,851
I have something you might be
interested in.

952
01:14:30,955 --> 01:14:36,482
It's a DVD with all the hidden
surveillance cameras I have to my place.

953
01:14:36,482 --> 01:14:39,401
It's plenty. I haven't checked it out yet.

954
01:14:39,401 --> 01:14:42,842
Maybe the thieves have been
careless enough to be photographed.

955
01:14:42,842 --> 01:14:46,075
I doubt it, this level of thief,
but I'll take a look.

956
01:14:46,179 --> 01:14:47,430
Yeah. You never know.

957
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:49,516
Okay. Well, merci.

958
01:14:51,288 --> 01:14:54,103
Thank you, Mademoiselle Lahiri,
for everything.

959
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:56,815
Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye.

960
01:14:57,857 --> 01:14:59,526
Mademoiselle Lahiri.

961
01:14:59,734 --> 01:15:03,488
Did you get the faxed copy
of the 1077? Good.

962
01:15:03,592 --> 01:15:08,493
Here's what I need:
A dozen -- Twelve uniformed officers.

963
01:15:08,493 --> 01:15:12,559
Metal detectors, extra cameras.

964
01:15:12,559 --> 01:15:16,522
So I'll e-mail you the photographs.
Do you happen to have a pen?

965
01:15:16,522 --> 01:15:19,233
I'll just give you the names. Okay.

966
01:15:19,233 --> 01:15:24,029
Livingston Dell, male, Caucasian,
5'6", 150 pounds.

967
01:15:24,134 --> 01:15:28,930
Virgil Malloy, male, Caucasian,
5'10", 160 pounds.

968
01:15:28,930 --> 01:15:31,641
Robert Ryan, male, Caucasian ...

969
01:15:38,419 --> 01:15:40,921
- Hello?
- Buon giorno, Mr. Eisenhower.

970
01:15:41,025 --> 01:15:43,215
This is your 5 a.m. wake-up call.

971
01:15:43,319 --> 01:15:45,718
- Really?
- Yes, I'm afraid.

972
01:15:45,718 --> 01:15:47,907
Have a nice day, sir.

973
01:15:58,222 --> 01:16:00,933
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

974
01:16:00,933 --> 01:16:06,251
- What --? Sleeping. Why are you dressed?
- It's 5:30, day of. We gotta go. Let's go.

975
01:16:06,981 --> 01:16:09,066
It's 11:30.

976
01:16:10,839 --> 01:16:12,820
The night before.

977
01:16:16,261 --> 01:16:17,617
But ...

978
01:16:23,456 --> 01:16:25,645
Oh, he's mean.
He's just mean-spirited.

979
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:27,835
- How many espressos did you have?
- Five.

980
01:16:27,939 --> 01:16:29,608
Yeah, come on.

981
01:16:39,513 --> 01:16:41,599
I don't know if she's just confused ...

982
01:16:41,703 --> 01:16:44,727
or she's really turned the corner
and hates me now.

983
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:48,481
You think I handled this wrong?

984
01:16:49,002 --> 01:16:51,505
I was too forceful.
I was too American.

985
01:16:51,609 --> 01:16:53,381
She's different.

986
01:16:54,633 --> 01:16:57,552
Maybe you're right,
maybe she has moved on.

987
01:16:59,638 --> 01:17:03,183
You know, I talked to a doctor
about getting that tattoo removed.

988
01:17:07,667 --> 01:17:11,837
But given its location,
he advised against it.

989
01:17:16,738 --> 01:17:19,762
That guy doing Potsie is unbelievable.

990
01:20:23,888 --> 01:20:25,348
I mean, what's this guy's problem?

991
01:20:25,870 --> 01:20:30,353
He's stitched us up twice in two weeks,
all over his ego.

992
01:20:30,353 --> 01:20:33,794
It's the first decent evening we've
had together in I don't know how long.

993
01:20:33,898 --> 01:20:36,714
All right, all right,
let's just stay on point here.

994
01:20:36,818 --> 01:20:38,695
Let's go over the list again.

995
01:20:38,799 --> 01:20:41,197
Who died and made you Danny?

996
01:20:44,847 --> 01:20:46,828
No one.

997
01:20:46,932 --> 01:20:49,435
I'm sorry. My emotions
are all over the place.

998
01:20:49,539 --> 01:20:52,138
I was forceful, trying
to show good leadership --

999
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:54,328
- For fuck's sake. Let's go.
- You're a good leader.

1000
01:20:54,536 --> 01:20:55,996
Thanks.

1001
01:20:56,309 --> 01:20:58,811
All right, well,
let's go over the list again.

1002
01:20:58,916 --> 01:21:00,480
- Swinging Priest?
- Not enough people.

1003
01:21:00,584 --> 01:21:02,148
- Crazy Larry?
- Not enough people.

1004
01:21:02,148 --> 01:21:04,025
- Soft Shoulder?
- Not enough people.

1005
01:21:04,233 --> 01:21:06,840
- Baker's Dozen?
- No woman and not enough people.

1006
01:21:06,840 --> 01:21:08,300
Hell in a Handbasket?

1007
01:21:08,508 --> 01:21:13,096
We can't train a cat that quickly.
And not enough people.

1008
01:21:14,973 --> 01:21:17,789
- What about Tess?
- What about her?

1009
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,187
Well, you know how she
kind of looks like --

1010
01:21:20,187 --> 01:21:22,168
- So what?
- Yeah, what's your point?

1011
01:21:22,272 --> 01:21:24,253
So we do a Lookie-loo.

1012
01:21:24,983 --> 01:21:28,946
- It's a Lookie-loo with a Bundle of Joy.
- A Lookie-loo with Tess ...

1013
01:21:28,946 --> 01:21:30,405
and a Bundle of Joy?

1014
01:21:30,510 --> 01:21:33,429
You've gone right out of your tree,
my son. He's mad.

1015
01:21:33,533 --> 01:21:37,079
It's crazy. It's Italian-television crazy,
and we're still one short.

1016
01:21:37,079 --> 01:21:42,396
No, think about it. She can get near the egg
during daylight with half the system down.

1017
01:21:42,396 --> 01:21:44,378
I mean, that's a trifecta.

1018
01:21:48,757 --> 01:21:51,885
He might be right. Make the calls.

1019
01:21:55,326 --> 01:21:58,246
Linus Caldwell, you are not
following the procedures ...

1020
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,061
Danny talked about
if Terry Benedict shows up.

1021
01:22:01,165 --> 01:22:03,042
Something is wrong. What is wrong?

1022
01:22:03,146 --> 01:22:04,815
Danny's fine. He's with Rusty.

1023
01:22:04,919 --> 01:22:08,256
During this part of the plan,
they can't communicate with us.

1024
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,715
Promise he isn't hurt.

1025
01:22:09,924 --> 01:22:12,322
I promise he isn't hurt.

1026
01:22:13,052 --> 01:22:14,825
You're gonna miss the deadline.

1027
01:22:15,033 --> 01:22:18,891
Danny would be thrilled if you met him
in Rome when the job's finished.

1028
01:22:18,891 --> 01:22:20,351
He misses you like crazy.

1029
01:22:20,455 --> 01:22:23,479
Plus, you studied art,
so I know how much you love Rome.

1030
01:22:23,584 --> 01:22:25,982
There's no downside here.

1031
01:22:27,337 --> 01:22:30,040
Wow, they're bringing you
along fast, aren't they?

1032
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:32,126
Yes. Danny would be more thrilled ...

1033
01:22:32,334 --> 01:22:36,818
if you were on the 7 p.m. out of JFK,
which means you have to leave right now.

1034
01:23:05,701 --> 01:23:08,725
I thought I'd requested a midsize.

1035
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:12,166
- Danny here?
- He wanted to be.

1036
01:23:18,109 --> 01:23:22,593
Did you have a nice flight? We weren't
sure if you were a window or aisle person.

1037
01:23:22,593 --> 01:23:26,138
- How long's Danny been in jail?
- Just a couple of days, really.

1038
01:23:26,138 --> 01:23:31,039
Which, you know, on the bright side,
he's completely safe from Benedict.

1039
01:23:31,039 --> 01:23:33,750
He told me everything was fine.
He lied right to me.

1040
01:23:33,750 --> 01:23:37,712
What I think he meant by "fine"
is we're running low on time and money ...

1041
01:23:37,816 --> 01:23:40,945
and we're deeper in debt
than when we started.

1042
01:23:41,049 --> 01:23:43,760
I assume that you have a plan
to get him out.

1043
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:47,305
- Actually, she sounds like her.
- No, she needs a Southern accent.

1044
01:23:47,409 --> 01:23:51,059
- Can you do a Southern --?
- What the hell is going on with you guys?

1045
01:23:51,059 --> 01:23:54,813
Not quite. The accent is crucial.
It's the first thing people notice.

1046
01:23:54,917 --> 01:23:58,045
- This ridiculous car, what is it doing?
- Okay, I'm sorry.

1047
01:23:58,149 --> 01:24:03,780
All right, I'm just gonna level with you.
Due to certain personnel losses ...

1048
01:24:03,780 --> 01:24:06,178
that we have sustained ...

1049
01:24:06,804 --> 01:24:09,411
we're -- Various readjustments
had to be made.

1050
01:24:09,515 --> 01:24:12,426
You're gonna have to play a small role
in this thing.

1051
01:24:12,531 --> 01:24:14,408
Okay? So can you put these on?

1052
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:18,683
I'd like you to put this hat on.

1053
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:22,436
You're gonna put on that,
and you're gonna stuff it with that.

1054
01:24:22,541 --> 01:24:27,337
And we'll turn around,
just give you a little moment.

1055
01:24:27,337 --> 01:24:29,214
Small role.

1056
01:24:29,318 --> 01:24:31,404
Who am I supposed to be?

1057
01:24:32,551 --> 01:24:33,906
Well ...

1058
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:37,660
Oh, really?

1059
01:24:37,764 --> 01:24:40,162
Well, absolutely.

1060
01:24:41,205 --> 01:24:45,585
I can have -- We can make
the suite available.

1061
01:24:45,585 --> 01:24:47,461
No, no, no trouble at all.

1062
01:24:47,461 --> 01:24:52,154
I mean, we would love -- We are honored
that she would think of us again.

1063
01:24:52,154 --> 01:24:53,822
Okay.

1064
01:24:54,030 --> 01:24:55,490
Okay. Thank you.

1065
01:24:55,595 --> 01:24:57,471
Bye.

1066
01:25:07,169 --> 01:25:09,775
How is this going to get Danny out?

1067
01:25:09,880 --> 01:25:13,216
- We needed someone famous.
- Why didn't you get someone famous?

1068
01:25:13,321 --> 01:25:16,032
Just think Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1069
01:25:16,136 --> 01:25:18,430
She wasn't in
Four Weddings and a Funeral.

1070
01:25:18,430 --> 01:25:21,558
"I." "I wasn't in
Four Weddings and a Funeral."

1071
01:25:21,558 --> 01:25:23,643
Just protect your fake baby.

1072
01:25:25,833 --> 01:25:27,084
I'm hyperventilating.

1073
01:25:27,189 --> 01:25:30,630
- Welcome back, Signora Roberts.
- Thank you. She's very tired.

1074
01:25:32,089 --> 01:25:33,758
- Take it. Take it.
- Okay.

1075
01:25:35,635 --> 01:25:38,450
Oh, let's hide. Let's hide.

1076
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,474
Julia?

1077
01:25:41,578 --> 01:25:44,081
My name is Teresa.

1078
01:25:49,294 --> 01:25:52,206
I thought I saw a friend of mine,
someone that I know.

1079
01:25:52,310 --> 01:25:56,168
No, absolutely not. You can't turn off
the pressure sensors. No.

1080
01:25:57,315 --> 01:25:58,775
Well, she can't touch it.

1081
01:25:58,879 --> 01:26:02,111
She's a movie star.
She's not the pope, for chrissake.

1082
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:05,135
You're from Smyrna, Georgia.
You were born in 1967.

1083
01:26:05,240 --> 01:26:08,368
- You like croquet and knitting.
- Your middle name is Fiona.

1084
01:26:08,368 --> 01:26:10,245
You've got 10 dogs, seven horses.

1085
01:26:10,349 --> 01:26:14,103
- Your favorite color is peach.
- She doesn't have more horses than dogs.

1086
01:26:14,207 --> 01:26:17,022
- I can't do this. I can't.
- Tess, we're out of time.

1087
01:26:17,126 --> 01:26:18,378
- "Julia," please.
- Julia.

1088
01:26:18,482 --> 01:26:22,236
No, we understand you're feeling
insecure. That is totally natural.

1089
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:27,032
- You're playing an actress. They're insecure.
- No, I'm not insecure. I'm freaking out.

1090
01:26:27,032 --> 01:26:28,700
- Yes. That's right.
- Brilliant!

1091
01:26:28,805 --> 01:26:30,056
You're playing a role.

1092
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,601
No, you're playing a role.
I'm apparently playing a real person.

1093
01:26:33,705 --> 01:26:37,981
- Yeah, so?
- It's just wrong.

1094
01:26:41,004 --> 01:26:44,028
You mean, like, morally?

1095
01:26:44,133 --> 01:26:46,635
No. Well, yes.

1096
01:26:46,844 --> 01:26:50,702
Probably -- It's not the point.
The point is you want me to speak ...

1097
01:26:50,702 --> 01:26:53,621
for someone who's out there somewhere.
It's too personal.

1098
01:26:53,621 --> 01:26:56,332
More personal than your husband
doing 25-to-life?

1099
01:26:56,332 --> 01:26:59,877
He won't do 25-to-life. Benedict will
have him killed immediately.

1100
01:26:59,877 --> 01:27:01,963
- Don't.
- I'm sorry, that was stupid.

1101
01:27:01,963 --> 01:27:06,238
We're gonna be in and out in 10 minutes.
We have to. That's our time frame.

1102
01:27:06,342 --> 01:27:10,200
You don't even have to talk. Give them
a big smile, wave at the cameras.

1103
01:27:10,200 --> 01:27:13,328
- That's all she ever does.
- But if you do say something ...

1104
01:27:13,433 --> 01:27:17,395
don't forget your accent.
Drop your G's, and longer vowels.

1105
01:27:17,395 --> 01:27:18,959
Room service.

1106
01:27:19,063 --> 01:27:21,879
It's gonna be fine.
You've gotta remember something.

1107
01:27:21,879 --> 01:27:25,111
You are an image to these people.
You're like an object.

1108
01:27:25,111 --> 01:27:29,490
Nobody actually knows you.
The last thing this is gonna be is personal.

1109
01:27:34,175 --> 01:27:36,469
- Aren't you overdue?
- Why are you in Rome?

1110
01:27:36,573 --> 01:27:39,701
- I'm here on vacation.
- I love you.

1111
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:42,829
You are not supposed to fly
eight months pregnant.

1112
01:27:42,933 --> 01:27:44,185
- I know.
- Is Danny here?

1113
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:45,957
- Of course.
- Danny.

1114
01:27:46,062 --> 01:27:48,251
- No, no, I mean, he has --
- He's working?

1115
01:27:48,355 --> 01:27:51,067
- Yes. Yes and no. He's working.
- In Rome?

1116
01:27:51,171 --> 01:27:53,673
- Bruce. Glen Snackwell, publicity.
- Hey, Glen.

1117
01:27:53,778 --> 01:27:55,133
- I'm a big fan.
- Thanks.

1118
01:27:55,342 --> 01:27:56,906
Great. You fired Marcy?

1119
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:00,659
You fired Marcy. Two weeks ago,
you told me I should go with Marcy.

1120
01:28:00,659 --> 01:28:03,683
- I'm sorry.
- Tell him what happened with Marcy, Glen.

1121
01:28:03,683 --> 01:28:06,186
- There's a story?
- Always a story with Marcy.

1122
01:28:06,186 --> 01:28:08,793
- Marcy -- Marcy ...
- You look fantastic.

1123
01:28:08,897 --> 01:28:11,087
- Such a surprise.
- You should sit down.

1124
01:28:11,191 --> 01:28:14,423
I'm with the studio.
Marcy's still very much in the picture.

1125
01:28:14,945 --> 01:28:17,030
I just wanted to get you for a second.

1126
01:28:17,447 --> 01:28:20,367
We're looking to come off
this baby thing strong.

1127
01:28:20,367 --> 01:28:24,746
You know, that little statue on the mantle
starts smirking at you after a while.

1128
01:28:24,850 --> 01:28:26,519
You know what I'm saying?

1129
01:28:27,457 --> 01:28:30,689
- Not really, Glen, no.
- Sorry. Yeah.

1130
01:28:30,794 --> 01:28:32,671
Hey, Jules, that reminds me.

1131
01:28:32,671 --> 01:28:36,216
I've been meaning to call you
since the girls and I were in Taos.

1132
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:40,804
- It's so good to see you.
- Come here. These are a mess.

1133
01:28:40,804 --> 01:28:44,245
Anyway, Tallulah left her
SpongeBob blanket in the red casita.

1134
01:28:44,349 --> 01:28:46,330
- Okay.
- So, what I wanna do -- Here.

1135
01:28:46,434 --> 01:28:47,894
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1136
01:28:48,103 --> 01:28:50,501
- Thanks, Bruce.
- Is call Marcus ...

1137
01:28:50,501 --> 01:28:55,402
and have him get ahold of Louise
so we can make arrangements to get it.

1138
01:28:55,402 --> 01:28:57,383
He's home now, right?

1139
01:28:58,634 --> 01:29:00,720
- Marcus --
- I need to talk to Marcus.

1140
01:29:00,824 --> 01:29:04,786
- That's so funny. What a coincidence.
- Go ahead. Talk to him.

1141
01:29:04,786 --> 01:29:06,976
Over by the window, with the reception.

1142
01:29:06,976 --> 01:29:09,992
- Hello?
- Hello, Marcus?

1143
01:29:10,304 --> 01:29:13,224
No, it's Julia. Who's this?

1144
01:29:13,328 --> 01:29:16,039
It's Julia. I'm with Bruce Willis.

1145
01:29:16,039 --> 01:29:17,812
You're with Bruce right now?

1146
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:20,732
Can I speak with him?
Oh, yes, Tallulah's SpongeBob.

1147
01:29:20,836 --> 01:29:23,964
- I'm sorry, can I talk to him for a sec?
- Did it drop out?

1148
01:29:24,172 --> 01:29:27,613
- Yes, it fell out.
- That's been happening all week.

1149
01:29:27,718 --> 01:29:31,159
- Put that phone away right now.
- What?

1150
01:29:31,159 --> 01:29:32,827
Hang it up and put it away.

1151
01:29:33,244 --> 01:29:35,851
Do you have any idea how vulnerable ...

1152
01:29:35,955 --> 01:29:41,273
a fetus' brain is to the electromagnetic
field created by your cell phone?

1153
01:29:41,273 --> 01:29:44,401
You might as well point a gun
at her stomach.

1154
01:29:44,505 --> 01:29:47,321
- I'm Bruce Willis.
- Simon Leopold.

1155
01:29:47,425 --> 01:29:50,032
- I am Julia's physician.
- He's a doctor.

1156
01:29:50,136 --> 01:29:52,430
What happened to Dr. Webber?

1157
01:29:53,785 --> 01:29:56,809
- You know, Doc? He was sick.
- Dr. Webber is on vacation.

1158
01:29:56,914 --> 01:29:59,103
- Well, he's sick.
- He's sick on vacation.

1159
01:29:59,208 --> 01:30:02,753
- Sick on vacation.
- Don't you hate that? Sick on vacation.

1160
01:30:02,857 --> 01:30:06,715
Sorry to have jumped on you, Mr. Willis.
You do very good actings.

1161
01:30:06,715 --> 01:30:07,966
Thank you.

1162
01:30:08,071 --> 01:30:09,426
- Snackbar.
- Snackwell.

1163
01:30:09,635 --> 01:30:15,057
It doesn't matter. If we are to get there
at 4:00 and do that ...

1164
01:30:15,057 --> 01:30:17,142
- I say 50-50.
- Closer than that.

1165
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:21,834
- 2-1 they don't make it to the museum.
- 5-1 they don't make it to the Egg Room.

1166
01:30:22,460 --> 01:30:23,815
What?

1167
01:30:26,318 --> 01:30:29,029
- She's still my wife.
- She's a novice. You said so.

1168
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:31,636
- Led by an apprentice.
- Being tracked by a pro.

1169
01:30:31,844 --> 01:30:33,513
You want her to win.

1170
01:30:33,617 --> 01:30:35,285
- Which her?
- You know which her.

1171
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:37,475
- The one that started all this.
- Right.

1172
01:30:37,579 --> 01:30:40,499
- Good. For a minute --
- Why would I say that? It's not her fault.

1173
01:30:40,603 --> 01:30:42,063
- It wasn't.
- Okay, then.

1174
01:30:42,167 --> 01:30:43,418
- Good.
- Good.

1175
01:30:43,627 --> 01:30:46,755
- I'm confused.
- Yeah, who are you talking about?

1176
01:30:46,755 --> 01:30:48,632
- Isabel.
- Tess.

1177
01:30:50,084 --> 01:30:53,316
- I loved it, but I figured it out.
- Not a lot of people did.

1178
01:30:53,420 --> 01:30:55,714
- That's amazing.
- The second she doesn't ...

1179
01:30:55,819 --> 01:30:58,113
talk to you in the restaurant, I knew --

1180
01:30:58,217 --> 01:30:59,468
You figured that out.

1181
01:30:59,572 --> 01:31:02,701
- Yeah, I mean, the movie still works for me.
- Great.

1182
01:31:03,118 --> 01:31:06,663
Can we just --? Does she really
need to be rushing this quickly?

1183
01:31:06,871 --> 01:31:09,270
- She's practically jogging.
- In Thailand ...

1184
01:31:09,374 --> 01:31:13,753
mothers routinely give birth in
rice paddies and then go right back to work.

1185
01:31:13,857 --> 01:31:16,360
- Amazing women over there.
- Rice paddy?

1186
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,905
She will not have it in a rice paddy.
She'll be at her own paddy.

1187
01:31:20,009 --> 01:31:23,346
And she will be very comfortable
because she will be strong ...

1188
01:31:23,450 --> 01:31:26,161
from this walk and this exercise.

1189
01:32:02,865 --> 01:32:04,742
Was she worth it?

1190
01:32:05,576 --> 01:32:07,348
Was Tess?

1191
01:32:10,685 --> 01:32:14,960
The moment that she doesn't talk to you
in the restaurant, I knew.

1192
01:32:15,065 --> 01:32:16,941
- Your friends didn't tell you?
- No.

1193
01:32:17,150 --> 01:32:19,548
- That's when you figured it out, huh?
- Yeah.

1194
01:32:19,652 --> 01:32:23,719
- But the movie was still enjoyable for me.
- Okay. Thanks.

1195
01:32:24,970 --> 01:32:29,763
If everybody's so freaking smart, how come
the movie did $675 million worldwide ...

1196
01:32:31,844 --> 01:32:33,617
theatrical?

1197
01:32:33,617 --> 01:32:35,077
Julia. Doctor.

1198
01:32:35,181 --> 01:32:38,622
Doctor, you might wanna
call the rice paddy now.

1199
01:32:40,290 --> 01:32:45,295
Seal off the museum. Nobody in or out.

1200
01:32:46,129 --> 01:32:49,049
- Bring -- Bring it, bring it.
- Quickly, quickly.

1201
01:32:49,153 --> 01:32:52,073
- Sit her down. Sit her down.
- Everybody just relax.

1202
01:32:52,281 --> 01:32:56,035
- Can you hear me? Talk to me.
- She is fine. She is fine.

1203
01:32:56,139 --> 01:32:59,580
She's good? Okay, that's it.
We're done here. No more pictures.

1204
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,978
- Thank you, Bruce Willis.
- Just don't worry.

1205
01:33:01,978 --> 01:33:06,254
- Thank you, museum. We are code four.
- Walk slowly, like you're doing.

1206
01:33:06,358 --> 01:33:09,903
We'll get you into the car
as fast as we can.

1207
01:33:13,970 --> 01:33:16,159
Okay, we're not stopping. Don't stop.

1208
01:33:16,264 --> 01:33:18,036
- Hello.
- We're on our way out.

1209
01:33:18,245 --> 01:33:22,416
Isabel Lahiri, I'm with the museum.
It is so great to meet you.

1210
01:33:22,416 --> 01:33:25,127
- We're very late.
- I'm sorry, this won't take long.

1211
01:33:25,231 --> 01:33:29,819
I don't wanna be an annoying fan,
but my boyfriend is such a huge fan.

1212
01:33:29,819 --> 01:33:33,155
I can't let you leave unless you sign
something for him. Do you mind?

1213
01:33:33,260 --> 01:33:36,179
- That's very unorthodox.
- Sorry, it won't take long.

1214
01:33:36,179 --> 01:33:38,473
- What's his name?
- His name's Robert.

1215
01:33:38,578 --> 01:33:41,080
Aren't you a lefty?
I thought you were a lefty.

1216
01:33:41,184 --> 01:33:43,374
She is a lefty.

1217
01:33:43,478 --> 01:33:45,668
Often pregnant women
become ambidextrous.

1218
01:33:45,772 --> 01:33:48,170
You are a big fan.

1219
01:33:48,275 --> 01:33:51,194
She doesn't necessarily
have to sign lefty.

1220
01:33:51,507 --> 01:33:54,114
Oh, thanks so much. This is great.

1221
01:33:54,218 --> 01:33:55,678
Okay. We're on the move.

1222
01:33:55,887 --> 01:33:58,180
Thank you. You take care, now.

1223
01:33:58,285 --> 01:34:01,100
And one more thing.
I just got off the phone ...

1224
01:34:01,204 --> 01:34:06,626
with someone called Marcy who put you
on a plane from Taos, New Mexico to L.A ...

1225
01:34:06,626 --> 01:34:12,562
where you have a 1:00 meeting
about a film, Clowns Can't Sleep.

1226
01:34:12,562 --> 01:34:16,941
Anyway, she just wanted me to let you
know everyone's running a little late ...

1227
01:34:16,941 --> 01:34:20,904
and was wondering if you could
make it at 1:30 instead.

1228
01:34:20,904 --> 01:34:22,989
I knew it.

1229
01:34:23,093 --> 01:34:25,179
Shame on you.

1230
01:34:26,326 --> 01:34:28,098
I don't think we've met. Bruce.

1231
01:34:28,203 --> 01:34:30,601
Isabel Lahiri. Nice to meet you.

1232
01:34:30,809 --> 01:34:32,478
Do you really have a boyfriend?

1233
01:34:32,582 --> 01:34:36,857
Or were you just --? Was that just
part of the whole thing with them?

1234
01:35:14,186 --> 01:35:16,897
So how'd it go?

1235
01:35:49,325 --> 01:35:51,298
You Lahiri?

1236
01:35:52,237 --> 01:35:54,739
I'm Section Chief Molly Starr.

1237
01:35:54,844 --> 01:35:59,119
I spoke to a very nice man at Europol
this morning, Commissioner Greisman.

1238
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:01,934
He wants you on the next flight
to Amsterdam.

1239
01:36:02,038 --> 01:36:05,166
There seems to be some irregularity
with your paperwork.

1240
01:36:39,576 --> 01:36:41,349
That one.

1241
01:36:41,557 --> 01:36:43,851
Let's start with that one.

1242
01:36:45,207 --> 01:36:48,230
Imagine yourself in a room ...

1243
01:36:48,335 --> 01:36:53,548
that's too short for you to stand up in
and not wide enough for you to lie down in.

1244
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:56,885
A room with no light, no heat ...

1245
01:36:56,885 --> 01:37:00,743
and stone walls scratched by the teeth
and nails of desperate men ...

1246
01:37:00,743 --> 01:37:03,558
men driven crazy by isolation.

1247
01:37:04,497 --> 01:37:07,312
You will have rats for company ...

1248
01:37:07,416 --> 01:37:11,900
and a small window that looks out
on the world that has passed you by.

1249
01:37:12,317 --> 01:37:17,531
Your parents will grow old and die,
just like your dreams.

1250
01:37:17,635 --> 01:37:21,389
Your friends will forget your name,
tell your stories as their own ...

1251
01:37:21,389 --> 01:37:25,351
because what good is a story when
the person who owns it has vanished?

1252
01:37:25,455 --> 01:37:28,062
- What do you want?
- Testify against the others ...

1253
01:37:28,166 --> 01:37:30,244
in the Benedict case.

1254
01:37:30,244 --> 01:37:32,225
The Italian charges will be dropped.

1255
01:37:32,329 --> 01:37:36,083
You and the others will be extradited
to the U.S. this afternoon.

1256
01:37:36,604 --> 01:37:40,149
Plead, and you walk with parole.

1257
01:37:42,026 --> 01:37:43,590
I can't.

1258
01:37:52,036 --> 01:37:55,581
Think about it, Linus.

1259
01:37:56,728 --> 01:38:00,065
For a moment there,
I was already forgetting your name.

1260
01:38:03,089 --> 01:38:04,549
Wait.

1261
01:38:09,032 --> 01:38:11,431
Just hang on a sec.

1262
01:39:22,640 --> 01:39:24,308
Linus.

1263
01:39:25,768 --> 01:39:28,270
Right. Thanks.

1264
01:39:29,000 --> 01:39:31,086
You okay?

1265
01:39:31,815 --> 01:39:34,944
- Well, I blew the meet with Matsui.
- Matsui?

1266
01:39:35,152 --> 01:39:38,697
Let me guess. He pulled
a Lost in Translation on you.

1267
01:39:41,408 --> 01:39:44,015
That's his idea of fun for first-timers.

1268
01:39:44,119 --> 01:39:48,499
- I mean -- How do I not see these things?
- Don't get down on yourself.

1269
01:39:48,499 --> 01:39:50,271
- Obvious.
- We talked about this.

1270
01:39:50,376 --> 01:39:55,381
I hope Danny and Rusty appreciate the job
you did in a tight jam. I am proud of you.

1271
01:39:55,381 --> 01:39:57,675
- Thanks.
- We both are.

1272
01:39:58,822 --> 01:40:01,533
- You --? You told Dad?
- I had to, sweetheart.

1273
01:40:01,533 --> 01:40:03,722
- You told Dad?
- We were on vacation.

1274
01:40:03,931 --> 01:40:05,599
I'm sorry.

1275
01:40:05,704 --> 01:40:09,666
Great. Thanks. You're gonna be
dining out on this one for months.

1276
01:40:09,666 --> 01:40:13,211
"Hey, remember the time your mom
had to come to Rome ..."

1277
01:40:13,628 --> 01:40:15,088
I'm sorry.

1278
01:40:15,192 --> 01:40:17,382
Every time with him. It's like.

1279
01:40:17,799 --> 01:40:21,240
It's like a ...
It's like a ...

1280
01:40:22,074 --> 01:40:25,515
That was for keeping me in the dark.
And that -- That ...

1281
01:40:25,515 --> 01:40:27,809
is for making me a master thief.

1282
01:40:27,913 --> 01:40:30,103
- And that ...
- Okay.

1283
01:40:30,207 --> 01:40:33,648
is for ruining our
second third anniversary.

1284
01:40:33,752 --> 01:40:37,923
Okay. Okay? Come here.

1285
01:40:44,492 --> 01:40:46,995
I'm sorry I kept you in the dark.

1286
01:40:49,601 --> 01:40:51,888
I'm sorry that I made you a thief.

1287
01:40:51,992 --> 01:40:54,807
- Master.
- Master thief.

1288
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:08,258
And I'm very sorry that I ruined
our second third anniversary.

1289
01:41:08,988 --> 01:41:12,533
- Okay?
- Okay.

1290
01:41:13,680 --> 01:41:15,870
You forgive me?

1291
01:41:15,974 --> 01:41:18,998
- A little.
- All right.

1292
01:41:18,998 --> 01:41:21,083
What was Bruce Willis like? Was he --?

1293
01:41:29,321 --> 01:41:33,387
Follow it. That's Ryan's car.
Follow that one.

1294
01:41:57,787 --> 01:42:00,081
Hey, wait, wait!

1295
01:42:00,602 --> 01:42:03,105
What the hell is going on?

1296
01:42:03,835 --> 01:42:06,546
Your father's alive, Izzy.

1297
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:09,674
Your mom lied to you ...

1298
01:42:09,882 --> 01:42:13,636
to keep you from him. He's alive.
- What are you talking about?

1299
01:42:13,636 --> 01:42:17,807
When they divorced, she told him if he
contacted you, she'd go to the cops ...

1300
01:42:17,807 --> 01:42:19,997
with everything to put him in jail.

1301
01:42:20,101 --> 01:42:22,082
How do you know that?

1302
01:42:22,186 --> 01:42:25,523
And why should I believe you?
I don't believe you, okay?

1303
01:42:35,421 --> 01:42:37,506
You know where he is?

1304
01:42:37,506 --> 01:42:39,696
I know somebody who does.

1305
01:42:46,890 --> 01:42:50,644
There's nothing back there
but a forged 1077.

1306
01:44:31,779 --> 01:44:34,490
- No. Really? No.
- No.

1307
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:36,158
That'd be horrible.

1308
01:44:36,367 --> 01:44:38,869
It's hard, you know, for dinners.

1309
01:44:38,869 --> 01:44:42,727
Well, you must have very good contacts.

1310
01:44:42,727 --> 01:44:46,377
I hear it usually takes days
to buy your way out.

1311
01:44:47,211 --> 01:44:51,382
- Tess, this is François Toulour.
- Madame Ocean, at last.

1312
01:44:51,382 --> 01:44:52,737
- Hello.
- He's French.

1313
01:44:52,946 --> 01:44:55,553
Shouldn't you be somewhere else
by now, like ...

1314
01:44:55,761 --> 01:44:58,785
Outer Mongolia, maybe?

1315
01:44:58,785 --> 01:45:02,747
Well, before we get to that,
we just wanted to ask you one question.

1316
01:45:02,852 --> 01:45:04,520
- What is that?
- How'd you do it?

1317
01:45:04,624 --> 01:45:08,170
Oh, so that's why you came.
You wanna know.

1318
01:45:08,691 --> 01:45:11,402
Well, I guess that's normal.

1319
01:45:12,549 --> 01:45:15,156
But I got another deal for you.

1320
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:19,431
You both recognize that I'm the best,
and I'll tell you my secret.

1321
01:45:20,265 --> 01:45:23,080
- Yeah.
- That ...

1322
01:45:24,853 --> 01:45:28,815
Make it if you get him to tell us ...

1323
01:45:28,815 --> 01:45:31,318
and tell him that he is the best.
- Oh, okay.

1324
01:45:31,422 --> 01:45:36,844
- I won't tell him because you're the best.
- All right. Thank you.

1325
01:45:37,470 --> 01:45:39,242
All right.

1326
01:45:39,347 --> 01:45:44,247
We'll tell you you're the best
after you tell us how you did it.

1327
01:45:49,872 --> 01:45:53,311
How can I refuse
a dying man's last request?

1328
01:45:56,022 --> 01:46:01,548
The egg arrived in Rome at 6:45 p.m.
the Saturday before it went on display.

1329
01:46:01,548 --> 01:46:04,885
- It was at the museum by 8 p.m.
- Wait a minute, hold on.

1330
01:46:04,885 --> 01:46:07,909
You stole it that evening?
With the museum locked down?

1331
01:46:08,013 --> 01:46:11,350
How'd you get in the building?
How'd you get past the sensors?

1332
01:46:11,558 --> 01:46:13,331
Why didn't my recon team see you?

1333
01:46:13,435 --> 01:46:16,980
- Don't touch my thing.
- I didn't touch your thing. Like it works.

1334
01:46:16,980 --> 01:46:20,630
You got greasy hands, you put them
on the lens. Now I can't see.

1335
01:46:20,630 --> 01:46:23,862
- You can't see anything.
- I see you. You look like a retard.

1336
01:46:23,967 --> 01:46:25,322
You look like a retard.

1337
01:46:25,322 --> 01:46:29,910
I'll pay you a million dollars if you don't
speak for a month. One month.

1338
01:46:29,910 --> 01:46:35,332
- I wanna eat your whole head.
- Go ahead. A million dollars. No joke.

1339
01:46:35,541 --> 01:46:38,982
Right. With no equipment, no rope.

1340
01:46:39,086 --> 01:46:42,840
Of course. Come on, don't tell me
you don't know how to do that.

1341
01:46:42,840 --> 01:46:46,176
How did you get by the laser field
in the Great Hall?

1342
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:52,954
The laser fields. Well ...

1343
01:48:39,928 --> 01:48:43,890
Okay. Toulour, you're the best.

1344
01:48:43,890 --> 01:48:46,810
Well, thank you, Danny.

1345
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:51,815
Good. Now, if you can just
get us our money ...

1346
01:48:51,815 --> 01:48:53,587
we'll be going.

1347
01:48:55,151 --> 01:48:56,924
The money?

1348
01:48:57,654 --> 01:48:59,114
What money?

1349
01:48:59,114 --> 01:49:01,929
The money that you agreed
to pay Benedict if we won.

1350
01:49:02,033 --> 01:49:06,308
- We're under a deadline.
- No, no, no, you don't understand.

1351
01:49:06,308 --> 01:49:08,498
You didn't win.

1352
01:49:08,602 --> 01:49:11,410
You lost. And not only did you lose ...

1353
01:49:11,514 --> 01:49:14,746
your entire crew got pinched.
I gotta tell you something.

1354
01:49:14,955 --> 01:49:18,813
You don't look anything like her.
Eventually, the nose, but the ears --

1355
01:49:18,813 --> 01:49:21,315
I mean, the way you walk
and you dress ...

1356
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:45,402
That means that you spoke to LeMarc.

1357
01:49:47,279 --> 01:49:48,947
You spoke to LeMarc?

1358
01:49:57,706 --> 01:50:02,919
Since I'm dead, I think my involvement
in this should stay among the three of us.

1359
01:50:02,919 --> 01:50:04,275
- Of course.
- Absolutely.

1360
01:50:04,484 --> 01:50:10,218
It's ironic that the solution to all of
our problems will be provided by Toulour.

1361
01:50:10,218 --> 01:50:15,119
I'm sure I provoked him by agreeing with my
American friend that you might be better.

1362
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:18,352
I apologize sincerely for the trouble
I've caused you.

1363
01:50:18,456 --> 01:50:20,750
- There's no need.
- Especially now.

1364
01:50:20,958 --> 01:50:25,859
Remember, from the time you see Toulour
at his villa and the challenge begins ...

1365
01:50:25,859 --> 01:50:31,177
you must assume he will have you
under surveillance everywhere you go.

1366
01:50:31,490 --> 01:50:35,243
You'll have to put on
a very elaborate show.

1367
01:50:35,348 --> 01:50:38,476
The egg, the real egg ...

1368
01:50:38,580 --> 01:50:42,334
will be carried in a backpack
on a train leaving Gare du Nord ...

1369
01:50:42,334 --> 01:50:45,358
at 9:30 a.m.
- Thank you.

1370
01:50:45,462 --> 01:50:47,443
You saved our lives, Gaspar.

1371
01:50:47,547 --> 01:50:51,502
Yeah. And I'm still getting
the better of you.

1372
01:53:03,292 --> 01:53:05,586
And I stole a replica?

1373
01:53:06,420 --> 01:53:10,904
Your paintings are in a high-security
warehouse in Milan.

1374
01:53:10,904 --> 01:53:15,805
It's 17 Via Andreotti, unit 222.

1375
01:53:15,805 --> 01:53:22,061
- Security code is 2-3-1-1-6 --
- 6-4-6. Thank you.

1376
01:53:23,834 --> 01:53:28,526
Listen, all games aside, that was --
That was very good.

1377
01:53:28,526 --> 01:53:31,028
That was good. How'd you do that?

1378
01:53:35,929 --> 01:53:40,308
Well, I told you one story tonight.
I think that'll be enough. So now ...

1379
01:53:40,308 --> 01:53:45,313
if you, both of you, could please ...
Now.

1380
01:54:19,506 --> 01:54:23,573
- Whose house is this?
- It belongs to a thief I know in Paris.

1381
01:54:23,990 --> 01:54:26,284
He knows my father?

1382
01:54:26,388 --> 01:54:28,891
Probably better than anyone.

1383
01:54:30,038 --> 01:54:31,393
Who is he?

1384
01:54:31,497 --> 01:54:35,355
- He helped with the whole Night Fox thing.
- What's his name?

1385
01:54:35,460 --> 01:54:39,005
His real name? I don't know, actually.

1386
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:44,218
I've only known him as LeMarc.

1387
01:54:44,323 --> 01:54:46,095
LeMarc?

1388
01:54:58,087 --> 01:55:00,068
Oh, my God.

1389
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:18,836
Where the hell have you been?

1390
01:55:19,775 --> 01:55:21,860
Waiting.

1391
01:55:22,382 --> 01:55:24,571
For what?

1392
01:55:24,780 --> 01:55:26,448
For this.

1393
01:55:36,562 --> 01:55:39,065
Oh, my God.

1394
01:56:14,405 --> 01:56:16,490
So we done?

1395
01:56:16,699 --> 01:56:18,576
Issue closed?

1396
01:56:19,097 --> 01:56:23,268
- Is it actually good?
- It's good. Trust me.

1397
01:56:23,268 --> 01:56:27,022
I don't trust you, and I don't trust Ocean.
If it's good, we're done.

1398
01:56:27,022 --> 01:56:30,254
These grudges, they're awful.
Nobody wins.

1399
01:56:30,254 --> 01:56:32,757
Danny's had enough of this meshugaas.

1400
01:56:32,861 --> 01:56:35,468
And the competition,
it's worse than our business.

1401
01:56:35,572 --> 01:56:38,387
Always some new young punk
trying to prove himself.

1402
01:56:40,160 --> 01:56:45,060
Guys like Ocean, they keep coming back.
They don't like to lose.

1403
01:56:45,060 --> 01:56:49,127
- Too much ego, too much pride.
- Maybe for some guys, but not Danny.

1404
01:56:49,127 --> 01:56:52,777
Trust me on that.
Danny don't feel like he lost in all this.

1405
01:56:52,881 --> 01:56:55,800
It's hard to believe,
but that's how he feels.

1406
01:56:55,905 --> 01:56:59,971
Well, if he tries anything -- If anybody
tries anything, I'll be waiting.

1407
01:56:59,971 --> 01:57:02,265
Terry, I can't predict the future.

1408
01:57:02,369 --> 01:57:06,019
I pay professionals to do that,
and even they get it wrong sometimes.

1409
01:57:06,019 --> 01:57:09,356
I can't say that nobody'll ever
try to rob from you again.

1410
01:57:09,460 --> 01:57:14,361
But I can say this: lf, God forbid,
anything does happen to you ...

1411
01:57:14,361 --> 01:57:16,550
we will not be involved.

1412
01:57:16,550 --> 01:57:20,513
You better not be, Reuben.
You better not be.

1413
01:57:34,373 --> 01:57:35,415
Hey.

1414
01:57:37,501 --> 01:57:40,003
Good to see you guys.

1415
01:57:44,904 --> 01:57:48,553
You don't remember? You put me
through hell, and you don't remember?

1416
01:57:49,596 --> 01:57:51,786
- Hey.
- Hey.

1417
01:57:53,976 --> 01:57:56,374
- You're more beautiful than ever.
- Hey!

1418
01:57:57,729 --> 01:57:59,293
- Five-oh-five?
- Four-oh-five.

1419
01:57:59,398 --> 01:58:01,483
- Who's winning?
- I'm little.

1420
01:58:01,587 --> 01:58:03,151
- And you're big.
- You're big?

1421
01:58:03,256 --> 01:58:04,715
Oh, my God.

1422
01:58:05,341 --> 01:58:07,114
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

1423
01:58:08,991 --> 01:58:10,972
You're all under arrest.

1424
01:58:10,972 --> 01:58:13,161
You're thieves. You're crooks.

1425
01:58:15,143 --> 01:58:17,749
Isabel, Livingston Dell.

1426
01:58:18,375 --> 01:58:19,939
Thank you.

1427
01:58:21,712 --> 01:58:22,859
Isabel, Tess.

1428
01:58:23,067 --> 01:58:25,987
The adult table. That's the kids' table.

1429
01:58:26,508 --> 01:58:29,011
- Let me clear that for you.
- I'm in.

1430
01:58:29,532 --> 01:58:31,096
Can I get another beer?

1431
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:34,433
- I feel I know you.
- Wait, wait. We didn't -- We didn't bet.

1432
01:58:34,746 --> 01:58:35,997
You want five?

1433
01:58:39,125 --> 01:58:40,585
- Five.
- So nasty.

1434
01:58:40,793 --> 01:58:42,462
Okay.

1435
01:58:46,424 --> 01:58:47,675
Is that a joke?

1436
01:58:51,429 --> 01:58:52,993
Yes.

1437
01:58:53,514 --> 01:58:56,747
- Jesus Christ.
- She's drunk!
