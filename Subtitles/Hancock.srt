00:00:43,535 --> 00:00:45,870
All units, all units.
Code 3 pursuit of 2-11.

3
00:00:46,038 --> 00:00:48,539
White SUV heading east
on Alameda service road.

4
00:00:48,707 --> 00:00:50,082
Suspects: Three Asian males.

5
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,836
Be advised. Shots fired, shots fired.

6
00:01:43,971 --> 00:01:47,223
Cheryl, can you see how many
suspects are in this car?

7
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:51,811
As far as I can see at this point,
there are three sus...

8
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:53,688
Oh, this is just coming in.

9
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:56,023
Hancock!

10
00:02:05,158 --> 00:02:06,409
What, boy?

11
00:02:07,411 --> 00:02:08,744
Bad guys.

12
00:02:08,912 --> 00:02:11,372
- Trying to cut them off.
You can see them there.

13
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,708
They have their hands
outside the white SUV...

14
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:17,461
...shooting randomly on the freeway.

15
00:02:17,754 --> 00:02:20,673
What, you want a cookie?
Get out of my face.

16
00:02:21,758 --> 00:02:22,842
Asshole.

17
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:25,845
- What?
- You heard me.

18
00:02:32,978 --> 00:02:34,395
Please, stay off the freeway.

19
00:02:34,563 --> 00:02:38,190
I understand that there are
three suspects in the white SUV...

20
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:39,984
Asshole.

21
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,309
Watch out!

22
00:03:13,894 --> 00:03:15,728
Damn!

23
00:03:16,438 --> 00:03:18,314
Damn it!

24
00:03:51,014 --> 00:03:52,431
Hancock!?!

25
00:03:53,475 --> 00:03:55,476
Beat it, 'Soulja Boy! '

26
00:03:56,395 --> 00:03:57,687
Hancock is in the car...

27
00:03:57,854 --> 00:04:00,356
...and he appears to be
negotiating with the gunmen.

28
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:02,900
He smells like a bar!

29
00:04:04,403 --> 00:04:06,404
You pay for new roof!

30
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:10,408
Fellas, hey. I don't give a shit
what you did. I don't care.

31
00:04:10,575 --> 00:04:14,286
Three guys in the car,
no girls, rave music.

32
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:15,955
Hey, I'm not gonna judge.

33
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:20,626
But if you don't pull over
and give yourselves up quietly...

34
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:25,256
...I swear to Christ, your head
is going up the driver's ass.

35
00:04:25,424 --> 00:04:28,843
His head is going up your ass.
And you drew the short stick...

36
00:04:29,011 --> 00:04:31,470
...because your head
is going up my ass.

37
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:34,598
Shoot this asshole!

38
00:04:39,688 --> 00:04:40,730
Stop!

39
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,024
What the F%

40
00:04:55,662 --> 00:04:59,415
The department is on their way.
There's just chaos here on the 105.

41
00:05:12,804 --> 00:05:15,139
What? I'm not Japanese, man!

42
00:05:15,307 --> 00:05:16,348
Put us down!

43
00:05:16,892 --> 00:05:19,810
Oh, now you "speaky Engly," huh?
"Speaky Engly" now?

44
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:33,491
You broke my glasses.

45
00:05:33,658 --> 00:05:35,910
I'm sorry! Take my Ray-Bans!

46
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:39,205
- Put us down!
- You want down?

47
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,831
- Yes, please! Please!
- Help me!

48
00:05:40,999 --> 00:05:44,460
I'm real good at down.
I'm real good at down.

49
00:05:44,628 --> 00:05:45,961
All right? All right.

50
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:55,513
This, Hancock's latest act
of so-called heroics...

51
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,765
...took a hefty financial toll.

52
00:05:57,933 --> 00:06:02,186
Initial damage estimates
are said to top $9 million...

53
00:06:02,354 --> 00:06:03,562
...which, if accurate...

54
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,898
...represents a personal record...

55
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:09,276
...for the notoriously publicity-shy
Hancock...

56
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:13,322
...who, as usual,
can't be reached for comment.

57
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:18,327
With all the cracks to the concrete,
all the bullets, water damage, fires...

58
00:06:18,495 --> 00:06:21,080
...L.A. would be better off
if this guy would leave...

59
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,915
...and let us get on with our jobs.

60
00:06:56,992 --> 00:06:58,534
Hi.

61
00:06:59,578 --> 00:07:02,538
Don't think I'm crazy, okay?
We've looked everywhere for you.

62
00:07:02,706 --> 00:07:06,375
Going to the Roxy
and the Viper Room and Jumbo's...

63
00:07:06,543 --> 00:07:10,170
...anywhere we thought
you would be at. I found you.

64
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:12,756
I got you.

65
00:07:13,842 --> 00:07:15,676
So, what's it like when you fly?

66
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,600
- No, what?
- I ain't gonna fly you.

67
00:07:22,934 --> 00:07:26,228
I got a cousin, Narelle. She's my
best friend in the entire world...

68
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:29,690
...and I swear to God she would not
be here today if it wasn't for you.

69
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:33,694
She crashed her car up in Malibu
when you flew her to the hospital.

70
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,362
Remember?

71
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,407
I will break my foot off
in your ass, woman.

72
00:07:42,579 --> 00:07:44,204
You got a car?

73
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:09,897
Hey, want a drink?

74
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:14,985
So this is where you live.
This is your hideout.

75
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,738
Your Batcave.

76
00:08:18,239 --> 00:08:20,741
Your Fortress of Solitude.

77
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:25,996
- It's a couple trailers I stuck together.
- What's all this?

78
00:08:27,332 --> 00:08:29,833
- Jiffy Pop.
- Jiffy Pop.

79
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,628
- What do you do with it?
- Pop it.

80
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,798
- Jiffy Pop, pop. I like that.
- Hey, hey.

81
00:08:35,966 --> 00:08:37,007
Hold on.

82
00:08:37,175 --> 00:08:39,677
Want me to give you
something else to pop?

83
00:08:40,178 --> 00:08:42,846
- I didn't catch your name.
- Pop this, Superman.

84
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:46,517
Not much for the chitchat, huh?
Let me set this over here.

85
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:48,727
- All right. Now, there are some rules.
- Hello?

86
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,355
- No, I know, I haven't seen it yet.
- Excuse me.

87
00:08:51,523 --> 00:08:53,524
I know, probably. All right, all right.

88
00:08:53,692 --> 00:08:55,609
- Let me call you back.
- Listen.

89
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:59,571
You're gonna need to focus.
All right, I need you...

90
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:02,449
- Hey, that's... That's not focusing.
- What's in there?

91
00:09:02,617 --> 00:09:06,704
Okay, all right, hold on.
Stop. Stop it. All right, now...

92
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:10,082
...when I get to the moment...
- The moment?

93
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,129
You know, the... Start climbing
the mountaintop, you know?

94
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:17,506
- You know... All right? Yes.
- Yeah.

95
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:20,342
You're gonna need to be as far away
from that as possible.

96
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,803
- Far. That's hot.
- No, that's not hot. It's not hot.

97
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,222
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

98
00:09:26,224 --> 00:09:29,101
Hancock. Oh, yeah.

99
00:09:30,353 --> 00:09:33,188
- Now you're doing too much.
- Hancock.

100
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:36,483
Oh, mountaintop! Mountaintop!

101
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:38,652
Mountaintop! Watch out!

102
00:09:59,758 --> 00:10:01,467
Sorry.

103
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:07,347
That's not fair to anybody.

104
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:14,897
Thank you for being okay with that.

105
00:10:15,065 --> 00:10:19,026
- I know it's...
- Can I use the bathroom, please?

106
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:22,488
Yeah. Hey, you...?
You want some Jiffy Pop?

107
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,116
- No, thanks.
- It's straight back.

108
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:29,620
- You all right?
- Yeah.

109
00:10:29,788 --> 00:10:31,997
Yeah, I was trying to tell you.

110
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:39,046
Hey...

111
00:10:44,385 --> 00:10:49,223
Listen... You know, if you want
I could fly you.

112
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:53,811
It's really beautiful, you know?
Earth.

113
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:57,022
You could see the...

114
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:06,824
Might have to get you a helmet,
so your face doesn't tear off.

115
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,660
What do you think?

116
00:11:49,868 --> 00:11:51,618
Sir? Ray Embrey.

117
00:11:51,786 --> 00:11:53,120
- Ray.
- Pleasure.

118
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,707
- So...
- Ray's like the Bono of P.R.

119
00:11:57,417 --> 00:12:01,003
Well, actually, I think Bono
is the Bono of P.R., but I do try.

120
00:12:01,171 --> 00:12:02,838
Well, let's see it.

121
00:12:03,047 --> 00:12:06,425
Okay. I'll get right into it.
Good morning, everyone.

122
00:12:06,593 --> 00:12:10,137
I'm here to talk to you
about charitable giving.

123
00:12:10,555 --> 00:12:12,514
Okay? And we all know
the way that works.

124
00:12:12,682 --> 00:12:15,475
You give one, maybe two percent
of your net cash...

125
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:19,730
...and you get an armband, or a ribbon
or whatever. It's nowhere near enough.

126
00:12:19,981 --> 00:12:24,735
And that's why we at Embrey Publicity
would like to offer you...

127
00:12:24,986 --> 00:12:26,904
...the AllHeart symbol.

128
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:32,701
Now, you would be among a very
select group of corporate giants...

129
00:12:33,203 --> 00:12:36,246
...to bear this logo on your product.

130
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:38,415
And what this would say
to the public...

131
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:40,500
...is that your company,
Pharmatopsis...

132
00:12:40,668 --> 00:12:45,047
...has made a radical contribution
to helping our world.

133
00:12:45,215 --> 00:12:47,132
Here's all you need to do to qualify.

134
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,220
Your new TB drug, Mycodin?

135
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,514
We would like for you to give
that product away for free.

136
00:12:58,061 --> 00:12:59,770
- Did you say "free"?
- I did.

137
00:13:02,565 --> 00:13:03,815
Only to those who need it.

138
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,402
Only to those who without it
would otherwise die.

139
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:11,531
As a concept, free is kind of up there
with, you know, lethal side effects.

140
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:14,201
- Mandatory product recall.
- Get indicted, go to jail.

141
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:17,246
Get out, work at IHOP
for the rest of your career.

142
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:19,831
Understandable reaction.
It's a radical concept.

143
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,336
But it is the brand that represents
a fairer and better world.

144
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,796
The brand...

145
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:29,591
...that everyone is talking about.

146
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,677
Who is "everyone"?

147
00:13:31,844 --> 00:13:34,471
We do already have
a sports franchise.

148
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,683
- NFL? NBA? MLB?
- Soccer.

149
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,269
MLS? Which team?

150
00:13:40,436 --> 00:13:43,480
Well, it's a local team.
Encino Hurricanes.

151
00:13:44,857 --> 00:13:46,108
It's my son's team.

152
00:13:46,609 --> 00:13:50,362
Anyway, we can save the world.

153
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,865
All right?
Someone's just gotta go first.

154
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,493
What do you say?

155
00:13:58,288 --> 00:14:00,706
Are you a crackpot?

156
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:12,384
Hey, hon. You're probably at the store.
I am on my way.

157
00:14:12,552 --> 00:14:15,887
I think I made a connection.

158
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,265
Not really.

159
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,892
Listen, tell Aaron that I'm coming
and I... Damn it.

160
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,312
And I want some meatballs, okay?

161
00:14:23,479 --> 00:14:27,190
I need some Spaghetti Madness.
I'll see you in about 20 minutes.

162
00:14:27,358 --> 00:14:30,902
Hey! What is it, National Horn Day?

163
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,613
Idiot.

164
00:14:37,493 --> 00:14:39,036
Hey.

165
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:40,954
Hey. Hey!

166
00:14:41,164 --> 00:14:43,290
Move it. There's a train coming.

167
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,709
Do you not hear that horn?

168
00:14:45,918 --> 00:14:48,378
Let's go! I got a train!

169
00:14:48,546 --> 00:14:50,339
Move it!

170
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:53,800
- Back your car up! There's a train!
- I can't go anywhere. Get out!

171
00:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,469
Son of a bitch!

172
00:14:57,347 --> 00:14:59,556
Fix the handle, Ray. Fix the handle.

173
00:15:05,063 --> 00:15:06,688
Get out!

174
00:15:12,445 --> 00:15:14,488
Get off the track! Move!

175
00:15:23,122 --> 00:15:25,499
- Let's get him out.
- Get him out of there.

176
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,876
- Somebody help him.
- You all right?

177
00:15:28,044 --> 00:15:30,754
Please, that guy's still in there.

178
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,423
You sure?

179
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:36,259
Get him out of there!

180
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:44,351
Will you look at that?

181
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:10,043
- Ah, shit.
- I'm all right. I'm okay.

182
00:16:10,211 --> 00:16:11,503
All of you people...

183
00:16:12,296 --> 00:16:14,881
...blocking the intersection...

184
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:16,675
...you're all idiots.

185
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:19,970
You threw the dude's car at her.
And what's with the train?

186
00:16:20,138 --> 00:16:23,515
Why didn't you just go straight up
in the air with the car?

187
00:16:24,475 --> 00:16:26,435
You've obviously injured
that poor woman.

188
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:30,647
- She's right. She should sue you.
- Yeah, she should sue you.

189
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:33,692
Well, you should sue McDonald's
because they fucked you up.

190
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,236
You're an asshole.

191
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:38,738
And I can smell
that liquor on your breath.

192
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:42,075
- Because I've been drinking, bitch.
- You're a drunk asshole!

193
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:46,079
- You think you're such a hero.
- Asshole!

194
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:50,375
- You're nothing but an asshole.
- We don't need you in this city.

195
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:55,380
Some superhero you are! Fly off!

196
00:16:56,174 --> 00:16:57,841
Shut up!

197
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:59,593
Don't you understand? I'm alive.

198
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:03,430
I get to go home and see my family.
I should be dead right now, right here.

199
00:17:03,598 --> 00:17:06,558
Yeah, he could've gone straight up.
Obviously, you should've.

200
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:10,645
You know, and I was upside down
for the train, but...

201
00:17:11,647 --> 00:17:14,024
No. Thank you.

202
00:17:14,734 --> 00:17:17,277
Thank you very much, Hancock.
Thank you.

203
00:17:17,445 --> 00:17:19,696
Thank you, Hancock.

204
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:26,453
You're not flying by the Valley,
are you?

205
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,667
Throw the ball!

206
00:17:33,711 --> 00:17:36,713
Monte, one guy'll line up here,
all right? Hike the ball.

207
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:39,049
This guy'll be right here
and he says, "Hut!"

208
00:17:39,217 --> 00:17:42,886
This guy'll drop back. Hut!
Drop back. Chuck it.

209
00:17:43,804 --> 00:17:46,681
Great. Thank you.

210
00:17:47,016 --> 00:17:49,392
Nice aim. The driveway
would've been better, but...

211
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,394
- What's going on, Dad?
- Hey, buddy.

212
00:17:51,562 --> 00:17:54,189
Daddy's had a little bit of a day.
Look at you, huh?

213
00:17:54,357 --> 00:17:55,690
I want you to meet somebody.

214
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:59,236
This guy here, dragging
Daddy's car into the driveway.

215
00:17:59,904 --> 00:18:01,863
- Who's this?
- Hancock.

216
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:04,282
That's right. Hancock,
this is my boy, Aaron.

217
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,118
- Ray, what happened to the car?
- Oh, boy.

218
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,995
You would not have believed it.

219
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:13,166
I came this close to getting hit
by a train. If it wasn't for that guy...

220
00:18:13,334 --> 00:18:16,545
He saved my life. I mean...
Hancock, this is my wife, Mary.

221
00:18:16,712 --> 00:18:20,799
Believe that? I almost kissed a train.
Saw my whole life flash before my eyes.

222
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:23,510
- He saved your life?
- He sure did. Thank you.

223
00:18:23,678 --> 00:18:25,345
- Hey, you good?
- I am good, yeah.

224
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:29,849
- All right. Keep it off the tracks.
- I will, definitely.

225
00:18:34,021 --> 00:18:35,605
Hang on a... One second.

226
00:18:35,773 --> 00:18:39,192
- Hancock, you eat, yes? Human food?
- Yeah.

227
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,694
- You like meatballs?
- No.

228
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:42,904
Aaron, sweetheart,
he has to go and do...

229
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:46,116
- I love meatballs.
- Who's so busy they can't have a meal?

230
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:47,784
And it's on us. Please.

231
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:51,413
I'm not even gonna take no
for an answer. Get inside the house.

232
00:19:16,147 --> 00:19:19,149
Why do you have an eagle
on your hat?

233
00:19:20,693 --> 00:19:22,068
Do you like eagles?

234
00:19:22,278 --> 00:19:24,446
This guy's like a little
talking machine, huh?

235
00:19:24,614 --> 00:19:26,573
We don't have a lot of guests
over here.

236
00:19:26,741 --> 00:19:29,200
Look at that, huh?
Hon, is the heat on?

237
00:19:30,244 --> 00:19:32,245
No? All right.

238
00:19:33,331 --> 00:19:36,333
We started Spaghetti Madness
about two years ago.

239
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,211
We do it every Thursday, and we
have not missed a Thursday in...

240
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,630
- Ever.
- Yeah.

241
00:19:41,797 --> 00:19:44,049
- Ever? That's a long time.
- Yes, sir.

242
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,218
- A very long time.
- That's some good meatballs, boy.

243
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,720
Aaron.

244
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,805
- Your mama's calling you.
- Yes, Mom?

245
00:19:50,973 --> 00:19:53,308
No. His name is Aaron.

246
00:19:53,476 --> 00:19:56,603
- Hey, Aaron, how was school today?
- Fine.

247
00:19:56,771 --> 00:19:59,481
Yeah? No more problems
with that bully, Michael?

248
00:19:59,649 --> 00:20:02,984
- Michel. But not like a girl's name.
- Michel. No, no, I know.

249
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:05,695
- It's French.
- Yeah. Michel, Hancock, is this...

250
00:20:06,322 --> 00:20:09,240
Hancock? Michel
is this neighborhood bully.

251
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:11,576
We've been trying to teach Aaron
a little...

252
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:14,454
...about conflict resolution.
You know what I mean?

253
00:20:14,622 --> 00:20:18,333
- Yeah. Turn the other cheek, all that?
- That's exactly right.

254
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,878
Well, just never turn that one,
all right?

255
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,421
Never let them punk you.

256
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,215
- Got it, Mr. Hancock.
- Aaron, eat.

257
00:20:25,549 --> 00:20:28,885
The way you deal with bullies,
you take your right foot...

258
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:31,971
...bring it right up and catch him
in his little piss pump.

259
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,516
You don't have to do that, honey, okay?
Seriously.

260
00:20:34,684 --> 00:20:35,725
It's a good idea.

261
00:20:35,893 --> 00:20:38,770
You aim straight and make sure
he can't use that thing...

262
00:20:38,938 --> 00:20:42,065
...for nothing but a flap to keep
the dust out of his butt crack.

263
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,692
Okay, please, just stop.

264
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:45,610
Michel is not a man, okay?

265
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:47,570
He's a little boy. And his parents...

266
00:20:47,738 --> 00:20:51,282
...happen to be going through a bad
divorce. That's why he's acting up.

267
00:20:51,450 --> 00:20:52,784
Maybe you don't know this...

268
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:56,079
...but not everything in this world
gets resolved with force.

269
00:20:56,247 --> 00:20:58,289
- Not everything has to be bang...
- I'm set.

270
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:03,294
...scream, blood, more blood.
- Baby, I got plenty. Angel! We're okay.

271
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,879
She watches so much news...

272
00:21:05,047 --> 00:21:07,632
...that sometimes
it gets to be a little too much.

273
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,261
- You got a toilet?
- Yep. Yeah, just past the fridge.

274
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,391
Are...?

275
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:22,439
Did he just take the whiskey bottle
to the bathroom?

276
00:21:22,606 --> 00:21:24,107
Do you want him to kill us all?

277
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:26,276
Thanks for coming on in.
Good, right?

278
00:21:26,444 --> 00:21:28,611
- Very, yeah.
- Wanna say goodbye to him?

279
00:21:28,779 --> 00:21:31,072
- Bye, Hancock.
- Hey, all right, little buddy.

280
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:35,368
- Are you okay?
- It was a joke.

281
00:21:35,536 --> 00:21:38,079
- Come on, Aaron.
- Hey, sorry. I was just trying to...

282
00:21:38,247 --> 00:21:39,664
He got it. She didn't get it.

283
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,250
I owe you.
You gave me my life back today.

284
00:21:42,418 --> 00:21:44,461
Hear me out.
I'd like to return the favor.

285
00:21:44,628 --> 00:21:47,338
Do you know what I do?
I'm in public relations.

286
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,134
You know what that is? Of course
you do. We're image consultants.

287
00:21:51,302 --> 00:21:54,679
We change the way people see
products, companies, people, that stuff.

288
00:21:54,847 --> 00:21:57,849
Listen, I see you on the news
and I see you out there today...

289
00:21:58,017 --> 00:22:01,519
...and it can't feel good that people,
you know, hate you.

290
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:03,772
- It's good to meet you, Ray.
- No, I'm sorry.

291
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,148
But hear me out.

292
00:22:05,316 --> 00:22:08,985
People... Don't get me wrong, they
should love you. They really should.

293
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,988
I wanna deliver that for you.
It's the least that I can do.

294
00:22:12,156 --> 00:22:13,573
You know, you're a superhero.

295
00:22:13,741 --> 00:22:15,784
Kids should ask you
for your autograph.

296
00:22:15,951 --> 00:22:17,786
People should cheer you
on the streets.

297
00:22:17,953 --> 00:22:19,829
What the hell are you pricks
looking at?

298
00:22:19,997 --> 00:22:21,831
No, no, they're not... It's all right.

299
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:23,958
They're not pricks, they're just people.

300
00:22:24,126 --> 00:22:27,629
But I want you to give me
one short pitch, you know?

301
00:22:27,797 --> 00:22:30,465
That's all I ask. Okay?

302
00:22:30,633 --> 00:22:32,467
You use...

303
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,677
Put it under here?

304
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:37,222
Put it right there. Perfect.

305
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:40,266
E-mail me or whatever.
You just fly on over, I don't know.

306
00:22:40,434 --> 00:22:41,851
I want you to think about it.

307
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:44,562
Just be careful when you go.
Sleep on it, all right?

308
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,856
You get back to me?

309
00:22:47,191 --> 00:22:48,942
I'll be right here. All right.

310
00:22:49,109 --> 00:22:53,571
Please don't stare, you guys.
He's kind of one of us.

311
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,620
What about AllHeart?

312
00:23:00,788 --> 00:23:04,082
It's a nonstarter, babe, you know?
I'm chasing windmills with that.

313
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:07,418
Maybe I can't change the world
but I can change this guy's life.

314
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,256
- Think about all the good he can do.
- I think you're wasting your time.

315
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:13,174
You really hate him.

316
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:16,511
Hate? I don't hate him, Ray.
I don't even know the guy.

317
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,682
Just look at the news.
You can see what he does.

318
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:24,435
I think he just needs
people to care, you know?

319
00:23:26,146 --> 00:23:28,147
You see the good in everybody, Ray.

320
00:23:28,315 --> 00:23:31,317
Even sometimes when it's not there.

321
00:23:32,736 --> 00:23:36,573
I have a feeling about this.
Don't work with this guy.

322
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:42,161
I know this kind of guy.
He breaks things.

323
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:44,242
My bad. Everybody all right?

324
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,036
I'll go and get my mommy.

325
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:49,580
He is an asshole.

326
00:25:57,006 --> 00:25:59,090
- What's your name, boy?
- Michel.

327
00:26:02,136 --> 00:26:05,722
- You know who I am?
- My papa says you are an asshole.

328
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:08,683
Well, that's not really a nice word
to call a person, is it?

329
00:26:08,851 --> 00:26:10,727
- Asshole?
- Yeah.

330
00:26:10,894 --> 00:26:13,938
Because that could make someone
very angry...

331
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:16,315
...and, you know, maybe
hurt their feelings.

332
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:18,026
You behave like an asshole.

333
00:26:22,239 --> 00:26:23,322
All right...

334
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,033
Do you know Aaron?

335
00:26:29,163 --> 00:26:33,666
Well, seems to be a pretty good kid.

336
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:36,210
Just wanna ask you
to lay off of him a little bit.

337
00:26:36,378 --> 00:26:38,087
Why, asshole?

338
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,926
- You're gonna stop calling me that.
- Asshole.

339
00:26:44,595 --> 00:26:48,139
- That's not my name.
- Asshole.

340
00:26:52,269 --> 00:26:54,604
Call me a asshole...

341
00:26:54,772 --> 00:26:56,147
...one more time.

342
00:27:00,069 --> 00:27:01,903
Asshole.

343
00:27:04,865 --> 00:27:07,033
How about you, thickness?

344
00:27:07,618 --> 00:27:08,701
Goggles?

345
00:27:09,286 --> 00:27:12,789
Hancock! You son of a gun,
I knew you'd come.

346
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:14,373
Ask Mary. I had a feeling.

347
00:27:14,541 --> 00:27:16,793
I said, he heard me
and he's ready for a change.

348
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,712
This is great. Did you do this?
You come in a little hot?

349
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,380
I'll meet you in the house.

350
00:27:21,548 --> 00:27:24,592
- I know you don't drive, but...
- Oh, damn it, Ray.

351
00:27:25,928 --> 00:27:30,264
All right. You're all right.
You're all right. You're all right.

352
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:35,436
Oh, stop crying, punk-ass. Go ahead.

353
00:27:36,563 --> 00:27:39,398
- Not okay. Okay?
- He all right.

354
00:27:39,817 --> 00:27:42,819
Really not okay. This is some
of the stuff we're gonna work on.

355
00:27:42,986 --> 00:27:46,072
How do you think that conversation's
gonna go down with his mom?

356
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,991
Landing like that in the street's
also on the uncool side.

357
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:52,453
No, that was already like that
when I got here, Ray.

358
00:27:52,663 --> 00:27:54,789
I live here.
I know what the street's like.

359
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:56,833
We'll make those problems
of the past.

360
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,544
I'm gonna teach you
how to interface with the public.

361
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,880
- Where's the wife?
- Mary took Aaron to his soccer game.

362
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,007
Hancock, pulled some stuff up
on YouTube.

363
00:28:05,175 --> 00:28:09,470
Surprisingly large amount of not-great
stuff on you that's gonna be helpful.

364
00:28:09,638 --> 00:28:10,930
What is this?

365
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:13,850
That's me trying to change the world.

366
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:15,935
Unfortunately, not doing real well.

367
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:18,062
Come on. Let's get to you.

368
00:28:18,438 --> 00:28:20,690
This stuff was on YouTube.

369
00:28:20,858 --> 00:28:24,193
Everybody loves a Nutty Buddy,
I get it, but this doesn't work, sir.

370
00:28:24,361 --> 00:28:28,155
Hey, give me a Nutty Buddy.
Back up, back up.

371
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,702
Mom! Mom! Mom!

372
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,662
Those are children.

373
00:28:36,582 --> 00:28:39,750
- We've been waiting a long time...
- Get that camera out of my face.

374
00:28:40,043 --> 00:28:43,296
You ever put out
an apartment fire, Ray?

375
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:47,049
- No, I haven't done that. I'm in P.R.
- No. My ass was hot.

376
00:28:48,552 --> 00:28:51,470
All right. How about this?
This is Walter, the gray whale.

377
00:28:51,638 --> 00:28:54,432
Everybody remembers him
stuck on the beach north of Zuma.

378
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,641
Along comes Hancock.

379
00:28:58,228 --> 00:29:00,021
Hancock!

380
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:12,116
- I don't even remember that.
- Yeah.

381
00:29:12,284 --> 00:29:15,411
Greenpeace does. Walter does.

382
00:29:16,163 --> 00:29:17,914
This gets redundant after a while...

383
00:29:18,081 --> 00:29:21,208
...but my basic diagnosis
of your fundamental problem is...

384
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:23,044
- Do you wanna hear it?
- No.

385
00:29:23,462 --> 00:29:24,545
You're an asshole.

386
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,006
I know. I call it like I see it though.

387
00:29:27,174 --> 00:29:30,176
It's not a crime to be an asshole
but it's counterproductive.

388
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:32,345
But you are an asshole,
don't you think?

389
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:34,180
Be careful.

390
00:29:34,348 --> 00:29:37,600
All right, how about this?
I've been thinking about something.

391
00:29:37,768 --> 00:29:40,394
This kind of goes to
how you present yourself.

392
00:29:40,562 --> 00:29:43,856
Come on. Really? It's the middle
of the day. What springs to mind...

393
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,484
...when you see this?

394
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,403
Homo.

395
00:29:51,615 --> 00:29:53,240
- What about that?
- Homo in red.

396
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,704
- Norwegian homo.
- I'll give you that.

397
00:29:58,872 --> 00:30:02,208
Let's move past the comics. Let's
get into something a little deeper.

398
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:07,588
I think that deep down you behave
badly because you're lonely.

399
00:30:07,756 --> 00:30:10,675
I think deep down,
you want people's acceptance.

400
00:30:12,094 --> 00:30:14,387
Come on, now.
You save people's lives...

401
00:30:14,554 --> 00:30:17,640
...and they reject you,
and so you reject them back.

402
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:20,643
And it's a...
And we're gonna switch that cycle.

403
00:30:20,811 --> 00:30:22,603
We're gonna start fresh, start anew.

404
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:26,691
This is outstanding. If you turn
some of this power into willpower...

405
00:30:26,984 --> 00:30:29,110
- Almost.
- And then he kicked it in.

406
00:30:29,277 --> 00:30:31,237
Hey, Hancock! We almost won.

407
00:30:31,405 --> 00:30:34,699
Yeah, we did. Okay, upstairs.
I'm making lunch. Go change.

408
00:30:34,866 --> 00:30:36,283
Hey, sweetheart.

409
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:39,245
Have you been watching the news?

410
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:42,206
- No, we've been working on...
- Interfacing with the public.

411
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:44,542
- This has been on all day.
- That's very good.

412
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,129
The law is the law, Mr. Hancock,
and you are not above it.

413
00:30:49,923 --> 00:30:51,590
Felony destruction of property...

414
00:30:51,758 --> 00:30:55,553
...amounting to tens of millions
of dollars, theft, and now this.

415
00:30:55,721 --> 00:31:00,182
From where I sit,
I see a selfish, self-absorbed man...

416
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:04,687
...with a lot of muscle, but no regard
for anyone but yourself.

417
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:07,189
Mr. Hancock, let me remind you.

418
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:10,151
You are not above the law.

419
00:31:10,318 --> 00:31:15,239
You have failed to show
at over 600 subpoenas in civil suits.

420
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:19,076
Anybody else would be held
in contempt. But, oh, no. Not you.

421
00:31:19,286 --> 00:31:22,371
You may be a superhero,
but let me tell you this:

422
00:31:22,539 --> 00:31:26,417
You're not nearly as strong
as the U.S. Constitution.

423
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:28,085
Bank on it, buddy.

424
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:29,962
We do not condone the t...

425
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:33,174
Genius.

426
00:31:33,341 --> 00:31:35,926
Things just got real.
This is exactly what we need.

427
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:39,096
There's a DA trying to figure out
how to put you in jail.

428
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,891
- Bitch can try.
- I say you go.

429
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:48,022
People take you for granted.
Make people miss you.

430
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,358
- People don't like you, Hancock.
- I do.

431
00:31:51,526 --> 00:31:54,570
Two weeks, you know?
The public will be clamoring for you.

432
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,447
When they do, we'll be ready.

433
00:31:56,615 --> 00:32:00,284
Worst-case scenario is I'm wrong and
you just, you know, fly out of there.

434
00:32:01,078 --> 00:32:02,703
What do you got to lose?

435
00:32:21,431 --> 00:32:24,183
"I apologize to the people
of Los Angeles.

436
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:27,895
My behavior has been improper
and I accept the consequences.

437
00:32:28,355 --> 00:32:30,731
I ask my fellow Angelenos...

438
00:32:30,899 --> 00:32:32,858
...for their patience
and understanding."

439
00:32:33,026 --> 00:32:35,569
You're an asshole, Hancock!

440
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:36,779
Asshole!

441
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:42,076
"Life here can be difficult for me.

442
00:32:42,244 --> 00:32:44,370
After all, I'm the only one of my kind.

443
00:32:46,123 --> 00:32:48,582
During my incarceration,
I will be participating...

444
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:51,001
...in alcohol-
and anger-management treatment."

445
00:32:57,968 --> 00:32:59,135
You're a drunk bum!

446
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:02,429
"You deserve better from me.
I can be better. I will be better."

447
00:33:02,597 --> 00:33:04,473
All right.

448
00:33:09,354 --> 00:33:12,148
Good morning, ladies.
Welcome to your new home...

449
00:33:14,151 --> 00:33:15,734
It is the duty of each of you...

450
00:33:15,902 --> 00:33:19,280
...to remember
your inmate serial number.

451
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:21,615
Turn to your right.

452
00:33:23,785 --> 00:33:24,994
Turn to your left.

453
00:33:25,162 --> 00:33:27,997
Okay, scumbags. Let's go.

454
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,255
Give me the hand, playboy.

455
00:33:55,317 --> 00:33:57,443
I see you, punk!

456
00:34:17,047 --> 00:34:18,881
Oh, I get it.

457
00:34:19,049 --> 00:34:22,468
I put some... Most of you in here.

458
00:34:22,636 --> 00:34:24,637
Yes, you did.

459
00:34:28,767 --> 00:34:31,477
I can understand you feeling
some kind of way about that.

460
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:33,145
What?

461
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:38,484
So I'm gonna do me,
and I'm gonna let you do you.

462
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,819
I don't want no trouble.

463
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:43,322
All right?

464
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:45,491
I just wanna go to my cell.

465
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:48,494
- That ain't gonna happen.
- Nope.

466
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,955
Excuse me.

467
00:34:52,958 --> 00:34:55,751
Excuse me, please.

468
00:34:59,172 --> 00:35:01,173
Deadly.

469
00:35:02,008 --> 00:35:05,594
If you don't move,
your head is going up his ass.

470
00:35:13,561 --> 00:35:15,646
Y'all fellas sure you wanna
ride this train?

471
00:35:16,147 --> 00:35:18,565
Choo, choo, asshole.

472
00:35:34,749 --> 00:35:37,126
Get him out! Get him out!

473
00:35:43,466 --> 00:35:46,677
Did you shove a man's head
up another man's ass?

474
00:35:53,601 --> 00:35:55,936
We're gonna...
We're gonna circle back to that.

475
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:59,481
The DA's office wants your sentence
to run eight years.

476
00:35:59,649 --> 00:36:02,776
It's a big number,
but not something we didn't anticipate.

477
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,029
You know, our plan is...
What are you doing?

478
00:36:05,196 --> 00:36:08,282
Hey, hey, hey!

479
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:17,833
It sounded like you said they want me
to spend eight years in this shithole.

480
00:36:18,001 --> 00:36:20,669
Eight is more like four and a half
with good behavior.

481
00:36:21,004 --> 00:36:24,965
But it's irrelevant because
with you out of the picture...

482
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,760
...and with the crime rate
going up through the roof...

483
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:31,889
...the DA and the cops, they're all
gonna call for your immediate release.

484
00:36:32,057 --> 00:36:34,683
They're gonna demand it.
Where are you going? Sit down.

485
00:36:34,851 --> 00:36:37,478
Hey. Hey. Stop right there.

486
00:36:37,645 --> 00:36:38,854
- Stop it. Hancock.
- Move.

487
00:36:39,022 --> 00:36:40,564
- Hancock!
- Get back!

488
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,274
You're being a coward!

489
00:36:43,068 --> 00:36:45,027
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to you.

490
00:36:45,195 --> 00:36:49,073
- Who are you talking to, Ray?
- Stop pretending that you do not care.

491
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,700
You have a calling.
You're a hero, Hancock.

492
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:55,704
You're gonna be miserable the rest
of your life until you accept that.

493
00:36:55,872 --> 00:37:00,209
Trust me. Trust this plan,
this process. Just stay in here.

494
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,171
When they call, a hero's
what we're gonna give them.

495
00:37:06,383 --> 00:37:08,050
How we gonna do that, Ray?

496
00:37:10,095 --> 00:37:12,221
All right, guys, let's start sharing.

497
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:14,306
- Don? You had something?
- Yeah.

498
00:37:15,225 --> 00:37:19,603
Yeah, I think I might've had
a little bit of a breakthrough.

499
00:37:19,896 --> 00:37:21,438
Good for you.

500
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:26,402
Yeah, I mean, I realized
that breaking necks is... It's easy.

501
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:31,990
But I'm sitting there and I'm
staring at myself in the mirror...

502
00:37:32,158 --> 00:37:35,994
...and I thought, "This is tough."
- Yeah, it sounds tough.

503
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:38,372
Why do you always laugh?

504
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,959
Picturing you looking at the mirror.
It would scare the shit out of me.

505
00:37:42,127 --> 00:37:45,963
Every time I'm talking,
he completely ruins the cycle.

506
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,631
Now, let's watch the crosstalk.

507
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,259
I'm not gonna share anymore
if he keeps doing that.

508
00:37:50,427 --> 00:37:51,677
No, no, no.

509
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:53,929
- Keep sharing.
- Let's move on.

510
00:37:54,097 --> 00:37:55,973
Mr. Hancock,
do you wanna share today?

511
00:37:58,059 --> 00:37:59,143
Pass.

512
00:37:59,436 --> 00:38:02,938
Your landing is your first impression.
It's your superhero handshake.

513
00:38:03,273 --> 00:38:06,442
Don't come in too hot, okay?
Don't come in too boozy.

514
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:09,027
And don't land on
a $100,000 Mercedes. All right?

515
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:11,947
People have to be happy
that you've arrived.

516
00:38:12,782 --> 00:38:14,074
Mr. Hancock, your share.

517
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,243
Pass.

518
00:38:16,411 --> 00:38:19,163
So you've used the door
and the building's still intact.

519
00:38:19,330 --> 00:38:21,832
People are happy that you've arrived.
They feel safe.

520
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,251
There's an officer
and he's done a good job...

521
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:26,170
...so tell him he's done a good job.

522
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:29,256
What the hell did I have to come for
if he's done a good job?

523
00:38:40,143 --> 00:38:41,310
Oh, man!

524
00:38:43,438 --> 00:38:45,481
KBLA radio, AM 850.

525
00:38:45,648 --> 00:38:49,151
Today's big story, no surprise here:
Hancock. What's your take?

526
00:38:49,319 --> 00:38:51,195
I, for one, have
had enough of this guy.

527
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:55,073
I'm glad he's doing time around bars
and I hope they don't let him off easy.

528
00:38:55,241 --> 00:38:56,617
Let my cousin Pookie out.

529
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:59,578
"I see you don't wear
a bulletproof vest, security officer.

530
00:38:59,746 --> 00:39:00,954
I respect your courage...

531
00:39:01,122 --> 00:39:04,583
...because bullets don't bounce
off you, they bounce off me."

532
00:39:09,923 --> 00:39:12,257
This city is being run by gangs
and drug dealers.

533
00:39:12,425 --> 00:39:14,676
Hancock makes them
shake in their boots.

534
00:39:14,844 --> 00:39:18,055
He doesn't tie a pretty ribbon around it,
but he gets the job done.

535
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:19,431
Besides, he's hot.

536
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:23,852
Let me hear you say it.
Let me hear you say, "Good job."

537
00:39:24,521 --> 00:39:26,146
G...

538
00:39:26,606 --> 00:39:27,814
Goo...

539
00:39:28,066 --> 00:39:30,692
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

540
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:36,156
- Pass.
- Good.

541
00:39:36,407 --> 00:39:37,991
Good.

542
00:39:38,159 --> 00:39:43,247
Good j...

543
00:39:43,414 --> 00:39:49,169
Good job.

544
00:39:49,796 --> 00:39:53,549
Jail watch, day five, and true to his
word, Hancock remains incarcerated.

545
00:39:53,716 --> 00:39:55,759
Meanwhile, crime is still on the rise.

546
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:59,429
The L.A.P.D. is reporting
increases of up to 30 percent...

547
00:39:59,597 --> 00:40:04,017
...in the last five days
that Hancock has been behind bars.

548
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:11,275
- Hancock! Hey, Hancock!
- Hey, little buddy.

549
00:40:11,442 --> 00:40:14,319
- Hancock. We brought you something!
- Hey, hey.

550
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:17,406
Hey, what's up, Hancock?

551
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:19,199
Where's...? Where's Ray?

552
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,868
No, it's just us. Ray's working.

553
00:40:22,036 --> 00:40:24,037
Aaron really wanted
to come and see you...

554
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:27,416
...so we just dropped by
with some Spaghetti Madness.

555
00:40:27,584 --> 00:40:30,002
I should probably let the guard
check for keys...

556
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:34,131
- No, no. Here.
- Okay. Here you go.

557
00:40:34,841 --> 00:40:37,509
Oh, you brought me meatballs, huh?

558
00:40:37,677 --> 00:40:42,389
- Just dig in.
- Oh, man, look at that. Look at that.

559
00:40:46,519 --> 00:40:49,980
- That's a good meatball.
- Thanks, Hancock.

560
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:56,445
Ray is a good man.

561
00:41:05,622 --> 00:41:07,998
Whatever this is you're doing,
don't let him down.

562
00:41:09,125 --> 00:41:11,001
Okay?

563
00:41:13,296 --> 00:41:15,714
Okay. Well, we should
probably go, buddy.

564
00:41:15,882 --> 00:41:18,842
- Already? I wanna stay with Hancock.
- Yeah. Sweetheart...

565
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:21,845
...we have to go.
Come on, say goodbye to Hancock.

566
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:25,223
Here, Hancock. It's my favorite one,
and I want you to have it.

567
00:41:25,516 --> 00:41:27,601
- That was very sweet.
- Thanks, Mom.

568
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,353
Come here.

569
00:41:47,288 --> 00:41:50,040
Mr. Hancock,
would you like to share?

570
00:41:50,208 --> 00:41:51,833
Pass.

571
00:41:52,001 --> 00:41:54,252
All right. Phillip?

572
00:41:56,923 --> 00:41:58,173
I love you guys, man.

573
00:41:58,341 --> 00:42:01,093
- We love you.
- We love you too, Phillip.

574
00:42:50,309 --> 00:42:51,435
For when they call.

575
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:59,735
- I ain't wearing that, Ray.
- Yes, you are.

576
00:42:59,902 --> 00:43:01,611
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- No, you are.

577
00:43:01,779 --> 00:43:02,988
Actually, I'm not, Ray.

578
00:43:03,156 --> 00:43:04,948
You think you're not, but you are.

579
00:43:05,116 --> 00:43:09,995
I will fight crime butt-ass naked
before I fight it in that, Ray.

580
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:13,915
You know, you have fought naked.
We've got that. That's on YouTube.

581
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:17,711
Hancock, this is a uniform.
A uniform represents purpose.

582
00:43:17,879 --> 00:43:20,547
Doctors, policemen, firemen, right?

583
00:43:20,715 --> 00:43:23,258
- It represents a calling.
- It's been two weeks.

584
00:43:23,426 --> 00:43:26,845
- Yeah?
- Nobody out there is missing me, Ray.

585
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,390
Just be patient.
You gotta trust me on this. All right?

586
00:43:57,293 --> 00:43:59,836
Perimeter breach, perimeter breach.

587
00:44:01,631 --> 00:44:02,756
Asshole!

588
00:44:06,844 --> 00:44:09,054
You're still a fake-ass punk.

589
00:44:24,237 --> 00:44:25,403
Damn!

590
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:26,655
Mr. Hancock?

591
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,741
It's your share.

592
00:44:31,327 --> 00:44:33,245
Pass.

593
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:38,917
- Come on, man, try it. Let it out.
- Come on, John.

594
00:44:39,085 --> 00:44:40,377
I don't have nothing.

595
00:44:40,545 --> 00:44:43,088
There's nothing on your mind?
Come on, John.

596
00:44:43,256 --> 00:44:44,548
- It's cool, man.
- Come on.

597
00:44:44,715 --> 00:44:45,966
- Come on.
- Do it.

598
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:47,467
First time for everything.

599
00:44:47,635 --> 00:44:50,846
- Feels good to release, now.
- Let it heal. Come on, man, try it.

600
00:44:51,013 --> 00:44:54,474
Come in here all these days,
you don't have anything to share?

601
00:44:56,102 --> 00:45:01,022
I'm Hancock, and I drink and stuff.

602
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:05,527
All right. Thanks for sharing.

603
00:45:06,487 --> 00:45:08,530
- Okay.
- Thank you.

604
00:45:08,781 --> 00:45:10,323
- All right.
- That's awesome.

605
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:13,535
- That's a clap. Yeah.
- There you go. Good share.

606
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,344
Hey, Hancock.

607
00:45:31,512 --> 00:45:33,430
Come on, get up.

608
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,641
- You got a phone call.
- Take a message.

609
00:45:36,809 --> 00:45:39,019
It's the chief of police.

610
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:41,605
He says he needs your help.

611
00:46:06,923 --> 00:46:10,425
The trapped officer's husband
is Corporal Joseph Blake...

612
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:12,427
...who was killed last year in Iraq...

613
00:46:12,595 --> 00:46:16,056
...leaving her two small children.
We are waiting for the latest news...

614
00:46:16,223 --> 00:46:18,808
...but apparently
there are three suspects and...

615
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,226
What's going on?

616
00:46:22,063 --> 00:46:23,229
I'm out!

617
00:46:23,898 --> 00:46:26,524
Stay down! Stay down!

618
00:46:26,692 --> 00:46:28,401
Stay down!

619
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,153
- Get out!
- Get down!

620
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:31,488
Get it down!

621
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:39,621
Let's go! Everybody's gotta get back!
Let's go!

622
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:42,082
Back! Move!

623
00:46:54,887 --> 00:46:58,473
We got perimeters set up
on the north, east and south sides.

624
00:46:58,641 --> 00:47:00,475
The west side is open.

625
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:11,695
Don't break the building,
don't break the building.

626
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:21,538
What?

627
00:47:26,002 --> 00:47:27,669
It's a little tight. What you got?

628
00:47:27,837 --> 00:47:31,840
Bank job. I got at least eight hostages.
Four bad guys.

629
00:47:32,008 --> 00:47:34,175
Officer pinned down.
We can't get to her.

630
00:47:34,343 --> 00:47:38,304
They been spraying
the hell out of us all morning. And...

631
00:47:38,472 --> 00:47:41,891
They got some kind of heavy artillery.
Fifty caliber or bigger.

632
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:45,729
- I don't know if that matters to you.
- No, I'm good.

633
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:56,990
Good job.

634
00:47:57,283 --> 00:47:59,284
Really, good job.

635
00:48:07,126 --> 00:48:08,251
Get down!

636
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:39,741
It's Hancock!

637
00:48:47,249 --> 00:48:48,374
Take him out!

638
00:48:52,963 --> 00:48:54,923
Good job!

639
00:48:54,924 --> 00:48:57,092
Do I have permission
to touch your body?

640
00:48:57,259 --> 00:48:58,802
Yes!

641
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,347
It's not sexual.

642
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:06,059
Not that you're not
an attractive woman.

643
00:49:06,227 --> 00:49:09,062
- You're a very attractive woman...
- Get me the f%

644
00:49:14,485 --> 00:49:16,194
He's on the move!

645
00:49:30,459 --> 00:49:32,502
He's moving, he's moving!

646
00:49:42,304 --> 00:49:43,346
Good job.

647
00:49:43,514 --> 00:49:44,973
- Are you hit anywhere?
- My leg!

648
00:49:45,141 --> 00:49:46,683
- Hancock!
- Good job.

649
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:49,227
You said that.
I need you to end this now.

650
00:49:57,820 --> 00:49:59,445
Check the flanks.

651
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,907
Secure the perimeter.

652
00:50:06,787 --> 00:50:08,371
Spread out!

653
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:10,582
They're gonna
come around the back.

654
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,762
What happened to him?

655
00:50:26,599 --> 00:50:29,642
Where'd he go? Where'd he go?

656
00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:38,318
What is happening?

657
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,835
- I heard you was in the slammer.
- Out early.

658
00:50:56,003 --> 00:50:58,671
- Why's that?
- Good behavior.

659
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,174
Do you know what this is?

660
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:08,765
I'm guessing it's
some kind of detonator-type deal.

661
00:51:08,933 --> 00:51:12,310
There's 8 pounds of C-4 strapped
to each and every one of them.

662
00:51:12,478 --> 00:51:14,562
This is a spring-loaded
dead man's switch.

663
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:16,356
If my thumb comes off it:

664
00:51:19,568 --> 00:51:22,862
And now, since we've had
a little change of plan...

665
00:51:23,030 --> 00:51:27,200
...between the police showing up and
you sucking out all of my associates...

666
00:51:27,368 --> 00:51:29,535
...I want you to break into the vault.

667
00:51:29,828 --> 00:51:32,956
You'll find three quarter-ton pallets
of small bills inside.

668
00:51:33,332 --> 00:51:34,707
Thirty million dollars.

669
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:37,627
And you're gonna carry it for me.

670
00:51:37,795 --> 00:51:41,798
You are gonna get me safely
away from here with the money...

671
00:51:42,007 --> 00:51:46,302
...or else they'll be cleaning up
these hostages with a mop.

672
00:51:49,431 --> 00:51:51,307
I'm gonna have to say no to that.

673
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:56,396
I'm really trying
to turn over a new leaf.

674
00:51:56,563 --> 00:51:59,273
I will blow up this entire building,
you asshole.

675
00:52:02,403 --> 00:52:04,737
I really don't like that word.

676
00:52:04,905 --> 00:52:06,864
I will blow them sky-high...

677
00:52:07,032 --> 00:52:09,742
...and their blood
will be on your hands.

678
00:52:13,288 --> 00:52:15,415
Do you hear me, asshole?

679
00:52:24,091 --> 00:52:26,592
Call me a asshole...

680
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:28,469
...one more time.

681
00:52:31,432 --> 00:52:33,307
Ass...

682
00:52:38,188 --> 00:52:40,523
- Go, go, go. Move in!
- Go on, you're safe!

683
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:43,109
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Take it right in. Let's go.

684
00:52:43,277 --> 00:52:45,319
Bring it around now.

685
00:53:06,759 --> 00:53:08,468
Keep your hand on that trigger.

686
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,680
- Good job.
- No. You, good job.

687
00:53:14,975 --> 00:53:17,018
- Thank you.
- Good job.

688
00:53:18,687 --> 00:53:21,105
Hancock!

689
00:54:15,494 --> 00:54:18,412
Say hi to your fans.
Look what you got.

690
00:54:19,164 --> 00:54:20,706
Here we go. This way.

691
00:54:20,874 --> 00:54:24,460
- Hancock. At the bank today, intense.
- Thank you.

692
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:26,420
Smile.

693
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:27,713
Good job, Hancock!

694
00:54:30,259 --> 00:54:32,301
Hey. Boy, they'll let anybody in here,
huh?

695
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:36,430
Hancock, meet these guys. This is
Mike Kilbourne and Jeremy Himmel.

696
00:54:36,598 --> 00:54:38,099
Gigantic fans. Insane!

697
00:54:38,267 --> 00:54:40,518
These guys are partners
at the biggest ad firm.

698
00:54:40,686 --> 00:54:42,019
You never call, man.

699
00:54:42,187 --> 00:54:46,232
- I have called. A couple of times.
- Water under the bridge, man.

700
00:54:49,194 --> 00:54:52,238
Could you guys
get used to this or what?

701
00:54:54,158 --> 00:54:55,867
How'd you two meet?

702
00:54:57,744 --> 00:54:59,328
I was married once before.

703
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,581
First wife...

704
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:05,543
...she died giving birth to Aaron.

705
00:55:06,128 --> 00:55:10,423
It's another dinner. But... But...

706
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:13,176
So there I am, I'm with
this beautiful little baby.

707
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,136
I don't know what the hell to do.

708
00:55:15,304 --> 00:55:17,555
And I was in the supermarket...

709
00:55:18,265 --> 00:55:20,183
...and I'm in the baby aisle...

710
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:22,935
...and I've got
a brand of diapers in each hand.

711
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:27,064
I'm staring at them, but I don't know
how I'm gonna get through the day.

712
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:29,525
An angel...

713
00:55:30,903 --> 00:55:33,070
...sees me.

714
00:55:34,865 --> 00:55:37,700
She knew. She was...
She gave me this look.

715
00:55:39,244 --> 00:55:44,290
And even in the trance I was in,
I knew that somebody somewhere...

716
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:46,500
...was throwing me a little rope.

717
00:55:47,252 --> 00:55:48,336
You know?

718
00:55:48,503 --> 00:55:52,506
Starting that day, you really
put my life back together. Right?

719
00:55:53,675 --> 00:55:57,637
- You're drunk.
- So? Come here.

720
00:56:02,893 --> 00:56:04,477
What about you, buddy?

721
00:56:04,645 --> 00:56:06,604
You're from another planet,
aren't you?

722
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:08,940
No, man, I'm from Miami.

723
00:56:09,107 --> 00:56:11,484
You didn't come in on,
like, a meteor or...?

724
00:56:11,652 --> 00:56:14,237
Nope. Woke up in a hospital,
first thing I remember.

725
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:18,407
Government hospital, yes?
Experimenting on you and...

726
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:22,370
No, Ray. Regular old
Miami emergency room.

727
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,957
- Come on.
- My skull was fractured.

728
00:56:26,124 --> 00:56:29,752
They told me
I tried to stop a mugging.

729
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,173
- Somebody knocked you out.
- I guess I was a regular guy before...

730
00:56:34,341 --> 00:56:37,593
...and when I woke up,
I was changed.

731
00:56:38,762 --> 00:56:41,347
The hospital nurse tried
to put a needle in my arm...

732
00:56:41,515 --> 00:56:43,808
...and it just broke against my skin.

733
00:56:43,976 --> 00:56:47,687
And then my skull healed
in, like, an hour.

734
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:51,440
The doctors were astounded...

735
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,403
...and they wanted to know my story.

736
00:56:55,570 --> 00:56:59,323
Just like you. But I couldn't tell them.
I don't know who I am.

737
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,159
Amnesia.

738
00:57:02,577 --> 00:57:06,247
- You know, the blow to the head.
- Yeah, well, that's what they figured.

739
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:10,126
- You don't remember anything?
- No.

740
00:57:11,253 --> 00:57:14,088
Only thing I had in my pocket was...

741
00:57:14,256 --> 00:57:16,215
...bubble-gum...

742
00:57:16,383 --> 00:57:18,509
...two movie tickets.

743
00:57:18,677 --> 00:57:22,305
Boris Karloff, Frankenstein.

744
00:57:22,806 --> 00:57:25,725
But no ID, nothing.

745
00:57:25,892 --> 00:57:30,604
I went to sign out, the nurse
asked me for my John Hancock.

746
00:57:32,441 --> 00:57:34,233
I actually thought that's who I was.

747
00:57:35,402 --> 00:57:37,111
How come I didn't hear any of this...

748
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:39,238
...didn't read about it
in any newspapers?

749
00:57:39,406 --> 00:57:42,783
It was probably in the papers
80 years ago.

750
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,827
Eighty years ago?

751
00:57:45,037 --> 00:57:47,288
Oh, I don't age. This is it.

752
00:57:47,456 --> 00:57:50,291
- That's nice.
- Gotta wonder, though:

753
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:55,963
What kind of bastard
must I have been...

754
00:57:59,593 --> 00:58:01,802
...that nobody was there to claim me?

755
00:58:06,350 --> 00:58:10,478
I mean, I'm not the most
charming guy in the world...

756
00:58:10,645 --> 00:58:13,064
...so I've been told, but...

757
00:58:15,275 --> 00:58:17,151
...nobody?

758
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,293
Whoever it was they'd be dead
by now, anyway.

759
00:58:36,296 --> 00:58:37,630
Hey.

760
00:58:37,798 --> 00:58:40,591
Hey, Mary. You all right, baby?

761
00:58:40,759 --> 00:58:44,512
Yeah. Too much wine.

762
00:58:44,763 --> 00:58:47,139
I am a lightweight.

763
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:55,189
I'm sorry.

764
00:58:58,693 --> 00:59:00,694
You ain't do nothing.

765
00:59:05,492 --> 00:59:06,992
This was a nice dinner, Ray.

766
00:59:09,788 --> 00:59:13,874
- It was a good one.
- Almost call this fun.

767
00:59:18,672 --> 00:59:20,923
That didn't tire you out,
coming up the stairs?

768
00:59:21,091 --> 00:59:23,217
- Not really.
- I'm real spinny.

769
00:59:23,385 --> 00:59:26,303
Could've just flown me upstairs.

770
00:59:26,471 --> 00:59:29,140
- I could've done without that.
- Get your shoes off here.

771
00:59:29,307 --> 00:59:32,685
All right, that's all you're
getting off of me though.

772
00:59:35,814 --> 00:59:38,649
You believe in me,
don't you, Hancock?

773
00:59:39,317 --> 00:59:41,944
- Of course, Ray. I believe in you.
- Help me up here.

774
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,155
I got something to say to you.

775
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,783
Listen to me. This is important.

776
00:59:49,578 --> 00:59:53,080
You are like a Dodger Dog.

777
00:59:53,623 --> 00:59:55,958
It's something people don't think
they're gonna like...

778
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,627
...then they try it and they love it,
right? It hits the spot.

779
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,672
It's good for the soul.
You're like the world's Dodger Dog.

780
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:04,008
I don't know.
But you know what I mean, right?

781
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:08,512
You're gonna do great.

782
01:00:11,016 --> 01:00:12,850
You're gonna fix everything.

783
01:00:17,063 --> 01:00:20,858
- You get some sleep, Ray.
- You sleep tight too.

784
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:24,111
Hancock tucking me in.

785
01:00:35,916 --> 01:00:38,250
All right, he's asleep.

786
01:00:42,297 --> 01:00:45,508
- Okay, thanks. Good night.
- Good night.

787
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:56,519
Look, I just don't want you
to think that... That Ray...

788
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:58,562
...you know, drinks like that,
because...

789
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,981
- Oh, no.
- This was just kind of...

790
01:01:01,149 --> 01:01:03,108
...a celebratory night.
- No, I understand.

791
01:01:03,276 --> 01:01:06,278
- Yeah, I know that.
- Okay.

792
01:01:09,199 --> 01:01:12,660
The damn babysitter
never cleans up after herself.

793
01:01:31,555 --> 01:01:33,597
You have a bruise on your hand.

794
01:01:33,765 --> 01:01:36,850
Yeah, I don't...
I don't know what that is.

795
01:01:38,478 --> 01:01:41,063
I've been feeling kind of funny.

796
01:01:45,110 --> 01:01:46,902
You...

797
01:01:47,862 --> 01:01:49,196
You should go.

798
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,787
Getting late.

799
01:02:48,048 --> 01:02:49,548
If Ray finds out about me...

800
01:02:51,885 --> 01:02:53,761
...you're dead.

801
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:44,478
Joan, we're gonna take care
of that, okay? Don't you worry.

802
01:03:46,481 --> 01:03:48,315
Hi, honey.

803
01:03:48,483 --> 01:03:50,484
Breakfast?

804
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:53,487
Hancock sneezed, huh?

805
01:03:53,655 --> 01:03:56,824
Can you believe it? It's amazing
that you slept through that.

806
01:03:56,991 --> 01:03:59,827
- You're a good sleeper.
- Holy shit.

807
01:04:00,161 --> 01:04:03,455
I'm not gonna say
I told you so, but...

808
01:04:03,998 --> 01:04:06,709
You told me he was gonna sneeze
a hole through the house?

809
01:04:06,918 --> 01:04:08,335
I just said him being around...

810
01:04:08,503 --> 01:04:10,713
Oh, sweetheart, can you get that?
Thanks.

811
01:04:10,922 --> 01:04:13,340
- Oh, God, you strong man.
- I got it.

812
01:04:13,508 --> 01:04:15,801
But you don't worry about anything.

813
01:04:15,969 --> 01:04:19,304
I already apologized to the neighbors.
Called State Farm.

814
01:04:19,472 --> 01:04:20,931
Everything is taken care of.

815
01:04:21,641 --> 01:04:23,350
You just...

816
01:04:24,561 --> 01:04:27,438
...enjoy that breakfast.

817
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:32,025
What's this?
Are we going on vacation? Are we?

818
01:04:32,193 --> 01:04:33,402
Just the three of us.

819
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,028
- End of the summer?
- Tonight.

820
01:04:35,238 --> 01:04:37,364
- Tonight?
- Spur of the moment.

821
01:04:37,532 --> 01:04:41,034
- Tonight might be a little tough.
- Come on. The three of us?

822
01:04:41,202 --> 01:04:43,078
Me in a bikini?

823
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,788
- Sounds good.
- Let's go somewhere.

824
01:04:44,956 --> 01:04:48,292
Knock, knock.

825
01:04:48,293 --> 01:04:50,169
Gesundheit.

826
01:04:50,879 --> 01:04:55,382
I was just telling Ray here,
I hope you're done sneezing...

827
01:04:55,550 --> 01:05:00,846
...because I don't think our house could
take much more of your sneezing.

828
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:11,106
Yeah, sometimes
I sneeze when there's dust...

829
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:15,736
...or if I get really surprised.

830
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:20,073
That's unfortunate.
This is Kilbourne.

831
01:05:20,909 --> 01:05:23,327
Mike? How you doing?

832
01:05:23,995 --> 01:05:26,455
It was great to see you too.

833
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:29,833
Yep. Well...

834
01:05:30,043 --> 01:05:32,419
Right. Go ahead, shoot.

835
01:05:33,713 --> 01:05:36,632
Okay. I got a pen right here.

836
01:05:36,925 --> 01:05:39,635
Right. No, I know.

837
01:05:44,682 --> 01:05:46,850
It's right here in my hand.

838
01:05:54,359 --> 01:05:56,443
I am warning you.

839
01:05:56,611 --> 01:05:57,861
All right, go ahead.

840
01:06:01,407 --> 01:06:02,533
Okay, good.

841
01:06:03,451 --> 01:06:08,080
Now... And that's still in 310, right?

842
01:06:08,248 --> 01:06:09,414
Hang on one second.

843
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,542
Do me a favor...?

844
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,712
I'm sorry, Mike. Yeah.

845
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,756
We're gonna talk.

846
01:06:17,924 --> 01:06:20,842
Go away.

847
01:06:21,010 --> 01:06:24,930
Well, it is something
that I'm really excited about.

848
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:39,403
- I'm gonna do this all day.
- Shut... Shut up.

849
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:43,282
I... I suppose...

850
01:06:43,449 --> 01:06:45,784
- Fine. We'll talk, okay?
- We will.

851
01:06:45,994 --> 01:06:50,831
And when we're done talking, you
go away and you leave my family alone.

852
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:55,043
- My place at 4:00.
- Whatever.

853
01:06:56,004 --> 01:06:59,423
It means... Well, I'd rather not
talk numbers now.

854
01:06:59,591 --> 01:07:02,676
I'd like to save them for the pitch.
So let's just set a time.

855
01:07:02,844 --> 01:07:05,887
That's good with me.
I will see you then. All right.

856
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:08,974
Yeah, 3:30. Great.

857
01:07:09,267 --> 01:07:11,727
Hon, is it hot in here?

858
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:36,168
He hurt you, didn't he?

859
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:39,671
Come on, use your words.

860
01:07:39,839 --> 01:07:42,382
How did it make you feel?

861
01:07:45,219 --> 01:07:46,428
Sore.

862
01:07:47,138 --> 01:07:50,349
Bad.

863
01:07:50,516 --> 01:07:54,728
It's because he took your power.
And you have to get your power back.

864
01:07:56,230 --> 01:08:00,651
And no one will give you your power
back. You have to go out and take it.

865
01:08:00,818 --> 01:08:02,944
You understand me?

866
01:08:04,614 --> 01:08:06,573
We're gonna go find Hancock...

867
01:08:08,117 --> 01:08:10,535
...and get your power back.

868
01:08:41,901 --> 01:08:43,235
Well, I'm here.

869
01:08:44,237 --> 01:08:45,779
Yup.

870
01:08:51,452 --> 01:08:54,788
- You wanna do it?
- Do what?

871
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,627
I don't have time for this, okay?
You ask the questions...

872
01:09:00,795 --> 01:09:02,754
...I answer them honestly
and then you leave L.A.

873
01:09:02,922 --> 01:09:04,506
I ain't leaving L.A.

874
01:09:07,051 --> 01:09:10,095
All right, all right. Jeez.

875
01:09:12,223 --> 01:09:13,724
Don't.

876
01:09:25,945 --> 01:09:27,654
Ask.

877
01:09:29,615 --> 01:09:31,324
- You and I.
- "You and I" what?

878
01:09:31,492 --> 01:09:34,244
- We're the same.
- No.

879
01:09:35,079 --> 01:09:36,580
I'm stronger.

880
01:09:37,373 --> 01:09:38,790
Really?

881
01:09:41,669 --> 01:09:43,336
Oh, yeah.

882
01:09:44,505 --> 01:09:46,173
Who are we?

883
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:51,136
Gods, angels. Different cultures
call us by different names.

884
01:09:51,304 --> 01:09:54,347
Now all of a sudden, it's "superhero."

885
01:09:54,515 --> 01:09:58,143
- Are there more of us?
- There were.

886
01:09:58,478 --> 01:09:59,644
They all died.

887
01:10:01,689 --> 01:10:03,815
It's just the two of us.

888
01:10:12,825 --> 01:10:13,950
What is this?

889
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:19,539
Who are we to each other?

890
01:10:20,708 --> 01:10:22,709
- We're brother and sister.
- That's a lie.

891
01:10:24,212 --> 01:10:25,962
- No, I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

892
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,839
- I'm your sister.
- That is a lie.

893
01:10:28,007 --> 01:10:31,134
Sisters don't kiss brothers
the way you kissed me last night.

894
01:10:31,302 --> 01:10:32,636
You're lying, deal's off.

895
01:10:32,804 --> 01:10:34,888
Let's go see
how Ray feels about this.

896
01:10:35,056 --> 01:10:37,224
Get your ass back here!

897
01:10:37,391 --> 01:10:39,309
I'm telling!

898
01:10:44,649 --> 01:10:47,067
The AllHeart symbol
will be known globally...

899
01:10:47,735 --> 01:10:49,236
...as a symbol...

900
01:10:49,403 --> 01:10:54,282
...that represents companies that
are committed to changing the world.

901
01:10:54,450 --> 01:10:56,910
They can give away
their sustenance goods, okay?

902
01:10:57,078 --> 01:10:59,371
Food, drugs, power, clothing,
for free.

903
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:01,957
- We were talking about Hancock...
- Number two.

904
01:11:13,261 --> 01:11:15,053
You stay away
from me and my family.

905
01:11:15,221 --> 01:11:17,639
You are not gonna
do this to me again.

906
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:20,851
What? I don't know
what you're talking about.

907
01:11:21,018 --> 01:11:22,978
- Hey!
- I love you, Hancock!

908
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:26,648
It can't work.
It always ends the same way.

909
01:11:26,816 --> 01:11:29,317
Persia. Greece. Brooklyn.

910
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:31,278
Brooklyn?
I've never been to Brooklyn.

911
01:11:31,571 --> 01:11:34,155
I have put up with your bullshit
for 3000 years...

912
01:11:34,323 --> 01:11:36,241
...and I am done!
Done, you listening?

913
01:11:36,409 --> 01:11:39,703
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- Finally, I am happy!

914
01:11:39,871 --> 01:11:43,498
- You are not gonna mess with that!
- I don't know what you're talking about!

915
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:46,167
I hate to burst
your little crazy-lady bubble...

916
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:51,006
...but it must not have been all that
great because I don't remember you.

917
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:58,388
Call me crazy...

918
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:01,766
...one more time.

919
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:03,351
Cuckoo.

920
01:12:12,653 --> 01:12:14,154
All right, hold it. All right.

921
01:12:14,697 --> 01:12:17,490
You better not hit me with that truck.

922
01:12:18,200 --> 01:12:21,995
For companies to qualify, they need to
prove they are a leader in the global...

923
01:12:22,163 --> 01:12:23,788
We wanna talk about Mr. Hancock.

924
01:12:23,956 --> 01:12:25,916
They're committed
to bettering the world.

925
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:28,543
They can do this in four ways.
This is how they...

926
01:13:11,212 --> 01:13:14,089
The most important thing
with AllHeart is brand recognition.

927
01:13:14,256 --> 01:13:16,216
I've mocked up
these examples here...

928
01:13:16,384 --> 01:13:18,385
...in Tokyo, London, Dubai, Paris.

929
01:13:30,106 --> 01:13:31,856
Oh, no.

930
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,401
We need maximum exposure,
market penetra...

931
01:13:34,568 --> 01:13:35,610
Is it snowing?

932
01:13:50,418 --> 01:13:52,085
Stop. Stop it.

933
01:13:52,253 --> 01:13:55,046
Stop. Stop. Stop!
All right, let's just...

934
01:13:55,214 --> 01:14:04,723
Get off me!

935
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:07,100
Stop. Stop!

936
01:14:07,268 --> 01:14:08,893
Get off!

937
01:14:09,061 --> 01:14:10,311
- Get off me!
- Listen to me!

938
01:14:10,479 --> 01:14:12,939
- I hate you!
- I am sorry!

939
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:20,947
Whoever I am, whatever I did...
Look at me.

940
01:14:21,866 --> 01:14:23,867
- I'm sorry.

941
01:14:24,285 --> 01:14:26,327
I don't remember.

942
01:14:27,288 --> 01:14:29,664
You are the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

943
01:14:40,217 --> 01:14:42,010
Oh, my God.

944
01:15:32,478 --> 01:15:35,772
Why were you flying?
You were flying, Mary.

945
01:15:36,857 --> 01:15:39,692
- Yeah, she was definitely flying, Ray.
- Okay, I was flying.

946
01:15:40,820 --> 01:15:43,446
And I'm very strong as well.

947
01:15:43,614 --> 01:15:45,156
- It's just the way we are.
- "We"?

948
01:15:45,324 --> 01:15:48,409
Me and him, it's just us now.
The others paired up and died.

949
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:51,496
You didn't say anything
about pairing up at the trailer.

950
01:15:51,664 --> 01:15:54,290
- You were at his trailer.
- This is hard to explain.

951
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:55,875
- Great, I'm all ears.
- Me too.

952
01:15:56,043 --> 01:15:58,837
Do me a favor, just give me
and my wife one moment.

953
01:15:59,004 --> 01:16:01,464
- Don't bring it here, Ray.
- The adults are talking.

954
01:16:01,632 --> 01:16:03,299
Technically speaking...

955
01:16:05,177 --> 01:16:06,344
...he's my husband.

956
01:16:07,513 --> 01:16:09,973
Holy shit.

957
01:16:10,391 --> 01:16:13,184
- What?
- We broke up decades ago.

958
01:16:13,352 --> 01:16:16,312
Long before you were born.
He just can't remember.

959
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:19,607
But you can, right? You knew?

960
01:16:19,775 --> 01:16:22,277
That's something you bring up
on a first date, Mary.

961
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:25,738
"I don't like to travel.
I'm allergic to cats. I'm immortal."

962
01:16:25,906 --> 01:16:28,324
Those are some things
you give a heads-up on.

963
01:16:28,492 --> 01:16:32,412
Whatever we are, we were built in twos,
okay? We're drawn to each other.

964
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,956
No matter how far I run,
he's always there.

965
01:16:35,124 --> 01:16:36,749
He finds me. It's physics.

966
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:39,627
Are you saying that you two
are fated to be together?

967
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:42,714
I've lived for a very long time, Ray.

968
01:16:43,132 --> 01:16:44,841
And the one thing I learned...

969
01:16:45,009 --> 01:16:47,802
...fate doesn't decide everything.

970
01:16:48,345 --> 01:16:49,762
People get to choose.

971
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:52,223
And you chose...

972
01:16:52,391 --> 01:16:55,727
...to let me think I was here alone.

973
01:17:05,237 --> 01:17:07,822
I didn't think you'd miss
what you didn't remember.

974
01:17:09,408 --> 01:17:11,743
Great. Now what?

975
01:17:16,957 --> 01:17:19,375
I didn't plan for this.

976
01:17:42,232 --> 01:17:43,733
Prison authorities confirmed...

977
01:17:43,901 --> 01:17:47,612
...that the prisoner uprising
was led by Kenneth "Red" Parker, Jr...

978
01:17:47,780 --> 01:17:51,115
...who was also the leader of last
week's Spring Street bank robbery.

979
01:17:51,283 --> 01:17:53,618
At least eight prisoners
are not accounted for.

980
01:17:53,786 --> 01:17:56,079
More information
on the prison riot in Norwalk.

981
01:17:56,246 --> 01:17:59,499
Construction workers at the prison
were knocked unconscious.

982
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:01,709
The prisoners stole
the workers' clothes...

983
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,587
...and it's feared at least
some of them have escaped.

984
01:18:04,755 --> 01:18:07,006
Parker is considered
a criminal mastermind.

985
01:18:07,174 --> 01:18:09,884
He is very effective at
using psychological persuasion...

986
01:18:10,052 --> 01:18:12,553
...to organize criminals
from different backgrounds.

987
01:18:12,721 --> 01:18:15,682
He is a former psychology professor
from Stanford University.

988
01:18:15,849 --> 01:18:18,559
While there, he organized
a notorious criminal network...

989
01:18:18,727 --> 01:18:21,104
...comprised of graduate students
from diverse...

990
01:18:21,271 --> 01:18:23,356
Ninety-one ten.

991
01:18:23,524 --> 01:18:25,858
Ninety-one ten?
You gotta be shitting me.

992
01:18:26,318 --> 01:18:27,735
Ninety-one ten.

993
01:18:27,903 --> 01:18:30,321
Highway robbery.

994
01:18:54,179 --> 01:18:56,597
- What?
- I'm taking the money.

995
01:19:03,522 --> 01:19:04,647
I can relate to that.

996
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:09,902
You know? If you want something...

997
01:19:10,821 --> 01:19:13,865
...nobody can stop you
from taking it...

998
01:19:14,950 --> 01:19:17,201
...you just take it, right?

999
01:19:18,871 --> 01:19:20,747
I like that.

1000
01:19:21,915 --> 01:19:23,124
But can you take it?

1001
01:19:26,211 --> 01:19:29,172
My Zagnut bar versus your gun.

1002
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:37,680
Sorry about your window.

1003
01:20:25,062 --> 01:20:26,854
- I need Room 1020.
- Clear!

1004
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:28,523
I need Room 1020.

1005
01:20:31,819 --> 01:20:35,947
I need IV line, blood quality,
CBC, electrolytes, a PT, and...

1006
01:20:36,115 --> 01:20:37,657
Where's his IV line?

1007
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:40,159
- That's not gonna work.
- I'm in.

1008
01:20:41,620 --> 01:20:43,079
What's happening?

1009
01:20:45,958 --> 01:20:48,960
This just in.
John Hancock has been rushed...

1010
01:20:49,128 --> 01:20:50,878
...to Los Angeles General Hospital.

1011
01:20:51,046 --> 01:20:54,257
Hancock is in serious condition
with multiple gunshot wounds.

1012
01:20:54,424 --> 01:20:56,592
No story yet as to
how this happened to him...

1013
01:20:56,760 --> 01:21:00,763
...but we will continue to cover this
story live. Reporting live from L.A...

1014
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:09,981
- Any lead on the assailant?
- Mr. Embrey!

1015
01:21:10,149 --> 01:21:14,152
- Just a couple of questions, sir, please.
- Can you describe how it happened?

1016
01:21:14,319 --> 01:21:17,697
From what I've heard,
he was trying to stop a robbery.

1017
01:21:17,865 --> 01:21:21,492
Do you know if special ammunition
was used in the gun that shot him?

1018
01:21:21,660 --> 01:21:22,827
Not that I'm aware of.

1019
01:21:22,995 --> 01:21:25,413
Could this have to do
with the mysterious woman?

1020
01:21:25,581 --> 01:21:28,332
- He was seen battling her.
- I do not have that answer.

1021
01:21:28,500 --> 01:21:31,669
Could this woman
be more powerful than Hancock?

1022
01:21:34,548 --> 01:21:37,425
Here are the lab results for 209.

1023
01:22:05,162 --> 01:22:06,996
You're becoming mortal.

1024
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:10,499
It's us...

1025
01:22:10,959 --> 01:22:13,169
...being close to each other.

1026
01:22:13,921 --> 01:22:17,089
It's never happened this fast before.

1027
01:22:19,676 --> 01:22:21,052
You have to leave.

1028
01:22:22,387 --> 01:22:25,181
The further you get from me,
the better you're gonna feel.

1029
01:22:25,349 --> 01:22:27,975
You'll start getting
your powers back...

1030
01:22:28,185 --> 01:22:31,020
...and be flying and breaking things...

1031
01:22:31,188 --> 01:22:33,814
...and saving people
before you know it.

1032
01:22:48,163 --> 01:22:52,583
Well, it's like I said,
we were built in pairs.

1033
01:22:52,751 --> 01:22:57,713
And when we get close to
our opposites, we lose our power.

1034
01:22:59,925 --> 01:23:04,470
- Why?
- So we can live human lives.

1035
01:23:04,805 --> 01:23:07,515
Love, connect...

1036
01:23:08,684 --> 01:23:12,645
...grow old, die.

1037
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:16,524
What happened to us?

1038
01:23:20,696 --> 01:23:22,822
Summer of 4 B.C.

1039
01:23:23,740 --> 01:23:26,909
We were becoming mortal, like now.

1040
01:23:27,411 --> 01:23:29,620
They came after me with swords.

1041
01:23:33,041 --> 01:23:35,084
But you saved me.

1042
01:23:38,714 --> 01:23:41,090
1850.

1043
01:23:41,508 --> 01:23:43,467
They set our house on fire.

1044
01:23:44,594 --> 01:23:47,513
You pulled me out of the flames.

1045
01:23:49,599 --> 01:23:51,934
Eighty years ago.

1046
01:23:52,853 --> 01:23:55,021
What happened then?

1047
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:58,232
We were living in Miami...

1048
01:23:58,734 --> 01:24:02,153
...and a new movie
was playing in town.

1049
01:24:02,321 --> 01:24:03,404
Frankenstein.

1050
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:08,826
And after...

1051
01:24:09,286 --> 01:24:11,120
...we walked down Flagler Street...

1052
01:24:11,288 --> 01:24:15,249
...and you took my hand,
and you held it so tight.

1053
01:24:21,673 --> 01:24:24,633
And they attacked us in an alley.

1054
01:24:28,263 --> 01:24:32,558
They hit you so hard.
There was so much blood.

1055
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:36,979
They wouldn't let me ride
in the ambulance with you.

1056
01:24:37,898 --> 01:24:42,693
And by the time I got to the hospital,
you were awake.

1057
01:24:46,782 --> 01:24:48,366
But you didn't know me.

1058
01:24:50,869 --> 01:24:53,079
So I left.

1059
01:24:54,206 --> 01:24:57,041
Every time we're together...

1060
01:24:57,542 --> 01:25:00,002
...they come after you through me.

1061
01:25:13,683 --> 01:25:17,853
You're built to save people
more than the rest of us.

1062
01:25:18,021 --> 01:25:20,940
That's who you are. You're a hero.

1063
01:25:22,526 --> 01:25:25,236
The insurance policy of the gods.

1064
01:25:25,779 --> 01:25:28,989
Keep one alive. You.

1065
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:32,451
To protect this world.

1066
01:25:48,552 --> 01:25:49,593
Mary!

1067
01:25:52,389 --> 01:25:53,431
Mom!

1068
01:25:53,598 --> 01:25:54,974
- Mary!
- Stay down!

1069
01:25:56,101 --> 01:25:57,601
Okay.

1070
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:09,280
Mary?

1071
01:26:22,461 --> 01:26:24,211
Stop.

1072
01:26:26,715 --> 01:26:28,966
Oh, no! No! Please!

1073
01:26:38,894 --> 01:26:40,436
Stay down.

1074
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:53,991
Hey! Mary!

1075
01:26:54,159 --> 01:26:55,701
Let's go, get her up!

1076
01:26:56,703 --> 01:26:59,371
Come on, Chuck. Let's go, let's go.

1077
01:27:06,004 --> 01:27:08,422
- Morphine.
- Here. Help in here!

1078
01:27:09,716 --> 01:27:11,342
Hold her down. Hold her down.

1079
01:27:15,388 --> 01:27:25,189
Hold her down.

1080
01:27:33,490 --> 01:27:35,699
- You want the monitor now?
- Stay calm.

1081
01:27:52,634 --> 01:27:55,010
- Hold her, hold her, hold her.
- Need EKG leads.

1082
01:28:29,379 --> 01:28:32,506
Upon us all, Hancock.

1083
01:28:33,216 --> 01:28:34,633
You're no different.

1084
01:28:39,264 --> 01:28:42,641
Time to shut her down, Hancock.

1085
01:28:42,809 --> 01:28:45,060
It's been a nice run.

1086
01:29:13,465 --> 01:29:17,426
Oh, we are all
sincerely gonna miss you.

1087
01:29:19,262 --> 01:29:21,221
But it is time for you to move on.

1088
01:29:25,060 --> 01:29:28,103
And maybe to a happier place.

1089
01:29:30,106 --> 01:29:32,608
You can thank me if you want to...

1090
01:29:33,777 --> 01:29:35,402
...superhero.

1091
01:29:45,789 --> 01:29:47,414
You didn't!

1092
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:54,880
Aaron!

1093
01:33:05,613 --> 01:33:10,200
- What about Attila the Hun?
- Completely cross-eyed.

1094
01:33:10,368 --> 01:33:11,451
- Cross-eyed?
- Yep.

1095
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:14,413
All right,
what about Queen Elizabeth?

1096
01:33:14,581 --> 01:33:18,250
- Needy.
- J.F.K? What about him?

1097
01:33:18,835 --> 01:33:21,295
Oh, yeah.

1098
01:33:22,255 --> 01:33:24,673
"Oh, yeah"? Anything more?

1099
01:33:24,841 --> 01:33:27,593
Not like that. I was in Cuba
for the whole missile thing.

1100
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:28,844
Yeah, hang on.

1101
01:33:30,889 --> 01:33:33,140
- Hello?
- Ray.

1102
01:33:33,308 --> 01:33:35,267
Hey, I've been trying to call you.

1103
01:33:35,435 --> 01:33:38,186
Yeah, I was out of cell range.

1104
01:33:39,022 --> 01:33:42,733
- Are you outside?
- Yeah.

1105
01:33:42,901 --> 01:33:46,361
- Look up.
- All right, I'm looking up.

1106
01:33:46,988 --> 01:33:48,947
I'm looking up.

1107
01:33:54,329 --> 01:33:57,164
- Baby?
- What?

1108
01:34:04,589 --> 01:34:06,757
You're gonna change the world.

1109
01:34:06,925 --> 01:34:10,344
- Good job, Ray.
- Oh, my God, Ray.

1110
01:34:11,512 --> 01:34:14,056
Hey. Look up.

1111
01:34:14,766 --> 01:34:16,224
Hancock.

1112
01:34:20,772 --> 01:34:22,564
I'm proud of you.

1113
01:34:22,732 --> 01:34:24,566
Thanks.

1114
01:34:26,694 --> 01:34:29,154
Will I get in trouble for that?

1115
01:35:45,398 --> 01:35:47,691
- Freeze!
- Don't move!

1116
01:35:47,859 --> 01:35:50,027
- Oh, my God! Sam! No!
- Drop your weapon, sir!

1117
01:35:50,194 --> 01:35:51,611
Get back! Get back! Get back!

1118
01:35:51,779 --> 01:35:54,281
- Drop it!
- Get back or I'll shoot! Get back!

1119
01:35:54,449 --> 01:35:56,074
Get back! I'm not playing.

1120
01:35:56,492 --> 01:35:59,286
Get back. Get back!

1121
01:35:59,704 --> 01:36:01,997
Damn, Handjob.
Where you come from?

1122
01:36:02,165 --> 01:36:04,332
All right, relax.
Just tell me what you need.

1123
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,835
Tell them cops to take
their guns off of me.

1124
01:36:07,003 --> 01:36:09,254
- All right.
- Tell them to take the guns off me.

1125
01:36:09,422 --> 01:36:11,256
Just take them off.
Lower your weapons.

1126
01:36:11,424 --> 01:36:15,761
You're gonna get us out of here
with that tight-ass Wolverine outfit on.

1127
01:36:16,179 --> 01:36:18,597
Now let's make it happen, asshole.
