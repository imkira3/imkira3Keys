1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,467
 I must take the
stone to Paladin.

3
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:41,847
I want to stop until
I reach the monastery

4
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,664
The Paladin will
send to you that silver

5
00:03:44,689 --> 00:03:45,999
 my path is sure

6
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:48,376
 I have no fear.

7
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:52,966
 And the goddess says
you are to stay here for time being

8
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,280
 Trust the goddess always.

9
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:03,534
- For adventure.
- To riches and gold.

10
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:09,457
This you're, Marek. And that nice
piece of magic in the Ogre cave.

11
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:13,087
- Gojun will be upset
- Sure he is get you?

12
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,671
friend.

13
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,800
Trust the goddess.

14
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,116
Something is no right.

15
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,917
The stone. He took the stone.

16
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,587
And I saw her for the Darkspore.

17
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,106
Be well my sister.

18
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,921
The Warrior Thane, I have
seen how you look at him.

19
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:45,428
Make your choices with a clear heart
and trust the goddess always.

20
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,005
He has had enough.

21
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:40,367
- Marek, enjoy your fun
- Teela has gone because of you.

22
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,886
- He is drinking full
- That is enough

23
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:46,910
Get off of me, you cripple punk.

24
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,993
Leave me alone.
Leave me.

25
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,372
- He is drinking full
- Go away.

26
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:56,374
Marek, no...

27
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,674
More

28
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,610
Hello dagen.

29
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,994
Necromancer your darkness is real thing.

30
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,248
- It draws you to me.
- Marek.

31
00:08:59,331 --> 00:09:02,416
I've been waiting so hard time

32
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,962
Let me free from your pain

33
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:11,051
I can make you whore forever

34
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:14,263
Marek, I know you.
Arise.

35
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,273
Gojun.

36
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:13,404
Come with me.

37
00:10:32,716 --> 00:10:35,801
you appear into the darkness

38
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:39,473
And he is appears back.
I am so foolish.

39
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,025
The forces drove us together...

40
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,541
... but we did not see it.

41
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:47,648
I'm not looking for one
so young or woman.

42
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,400
- I'm sorry.
- What do you see about , Gojun?

43
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,281
- You're a necromancer
- Necromancer ?

44
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:02,495
You so advance the barrier in a long time.

45
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,331
He searched and I wondered

46
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:09,916
With an agree warrior search in a certain
 period into a sleep with my own

47
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,092
He has found you.

48
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,140
I had a dream, a figure.

49
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,935
He knew me.

50
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,689
Szorlok.

51
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,902
He is the darkest
as necromancers...

52
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:38,407
... 80 years ago he's trying on me
 by Deira door star.

53
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:44,537
Over the Darkspore
 Synthesize Century

54
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:48,061
Over the darkspore
 Synthesize Century

55
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:52,185
Over the darkspore
 Synthesize Century

56
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:23,868
You hold the Darkspore.

57
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:27,079
Over the darkspore
 Synthesize Century

58
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,213
All you show when
I unify the heart of the Lich King.

59
00:12:47,349 --> 00:12:51,980
Now you will fulfill the true
purpose of this ceremony

60
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:20,424
Lich king, for a thousand years
your power will rival the gods.

61
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:39,109
Szorlok, In the names of all the gods,
I command you to stop.

62
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,514
No.

63
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:15,063
Take the Darkspore,
we will hold him.

64
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:29,535
Gojun the betrayer.
The black heart beats again.

65
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:33,122
Darkspore is mine.

66
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,659
Parts in the wind.

67
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:59,375
For the four corners of the land

68
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,796
 No trace of the passing

69
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:14,182
Man has not known a power,
that he does not crave.

70
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:18,894
Those are bounded by
 the darkness do anything...

71
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:21,146
to keep their power.

72
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:29,114
The darkspore and they
all stand against Szorlok.

73
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:34,911
If the shards put together,
there is no way to stop him

74
00:16:34,995 --> 00:16:38,206
they have the power
 even beyond death.

75
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:42,419
What these have to do with me?

76
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:48,383
You are necromancer
your darkness is something he seeks.

77
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:52,428
Well, I won't be controled.

78
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:57,850
Yes, perhaps

79
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:03,397
But the lure of power draws in
the wisest men to their doom.

80
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:10,488
Szorlok was much like you once.
- I'm not like him. I am not evil.

81
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,650
you borrowed life for selfish gain

82
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:18,270
Is that not evil?

83
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,623
I'm not evil.

84
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:26,879
Evil runs in the blood of all men

85
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,385
You're untested and one day
 You'll be forced to choose

86
00:17:30,142 --> 00:17:32,160
You have the potential Marek.

87
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:36,139
For well good and for well evil.

88
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:41,016
But you need to learn to control your
power,or the choice will be made for you.

89
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,442
How can I control something
I don't understand?

90
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:45,755
I'm alone in this.

91
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,695
I will teach you.

92
00:17:50,343 --> 00:17:52,286
But you must be wary.Marek

93
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:57,035
When you delve into the void,
there is others who can sense you.

94
00:17:57,639 --> 00:18:02,050
Thus why Szorlok empoison your
dreams and Kishkumen is able to find you.

95
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:04,125
The man with the yellow eyes?

96
00:18:08,423 --> 00:18:13,405
- I took Kishkumen to Caeryn.
- The darkness has come.

97
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:17,346
And the world has need of heroes.

98
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:27,023
For now you must stay here.
I will return in a few days.

99
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,266
Łapeta, well fetch me
something to write with.

100
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,902
A message from your friend. The Elf.

101
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:21,493
Kill Marek and come to my room.

102
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:26,623
Put those over there.

103
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:31,545
 No, no. This one goes there.
And that one goes there. Right?

104
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,817
Hello, Marek.

105
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:59,407
I found you.
Dagen's looking for you.

106
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,329
Come on.

107
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:19,886
- I'm going to bed.
- Patience stay there

108
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,807
It takes some time to rebuild
the brush is broken

109
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,601
Right, of course.

110
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:36,401
Just a little attention here.

111
00:20:38,446 --> 00:20:43,284
Yes, and it should open right up

112
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:54,337
- What is it?
- I am not sure.

113
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,633
But Kishkumen has one just like it

114
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:02,678
- Dagen, we're in trouble.
- Why?

115
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,972
Give me some ink.

116
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:26,201
Is it a cypher?
-or of a code maybe?

117
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,622
No, it's a map.

118
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,584
Mondiatha.

119
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,007
- What is Mondiatha?
- An ancient city of giants.

120
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:43,385
It's destroyed now, but it's only
It is the biggest treasure ever happening.

121
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:47,496
The Darkspore in Mondiatha.We have
to get there before Kishkumen does.

122
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,882
- The Darkspore.

123
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,143
Am I missing something?

124
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:55,231
It seeps city and heart of the Lich King.
Broken into four pieces.

125
00:21:55,315 --> 00:22:00,027
Caeryn took the first piece from the
temple.And for Kishkumen was after.

126
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:04,657
- the second piece is in Mondiatha.
- What is it worth?

127
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:08,744
If it forced, an army can
 become invincible

128
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,413
The limits of this power is
death and destruction.

129
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,610
I see why he is interested.

130
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:16,835
With any luck this
map shows the entrance.

131
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,130
Whatever it is,
we know where it is will be.

132
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,134
- We shall avenge the Caeryn death.
- I promised Gojun by to stay

133
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:28,473
Hello blue heart; If you see it is
where the risk of developments

134
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:32,018
Kishkumen has half a day on, Marek.
 We owe this to Teela.

135
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,922
We owe this to Teela?

136
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:37,713
Last I checked Teela's
 goddess owes us.

137
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,567
However

138
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,822
A hidden treasure of legendary
proportions, unguarded ...

139
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:49,243
and to have taken it I could be worry
I am free; but we all could be rich.

140
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,537
- Fight the treasure.
- Fight the treasure?

141
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,663
I don't have to share this with you, Ok!

142
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,209
It could very easily,
I have just taken this and...

143
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:03,382
Marek, you can get you
face of those posters

144
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:08,221
Then and Then
... You could save the world.

145
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,725
We leave today.

146
00:23:14,856 --> 00:23:17,169
With Teela? Good luck with that.

147
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,900
She isn't speaking to anyone for 14 days.
But an assess, mourning rite.

148
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:23,069
- I'll find her
- Send this one

149
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,971
He need the work out, some of his anger

150
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,753
You and I can get my silver's
worth in the bed.

151
00:23:28,941 --> 00:23:31,063
Paid before to noon.

152
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:32,768
What time is it?

153
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,622
Noon.

154
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:41,379
Tell Teela we are not with her

155
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,936
Eat fruit.
Noon?

156
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:08,322
your slave girl with the deformed foot
 I like to purchase her from you

157
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,338
She ran

158
00:24:11,363 --> 00:24:14,393
I put a bounty on her head.
yes the bounty is too high

159
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:20,208
Yes. Bounties are high.
She's worth what? 500?

160
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,879
600 on the open market?

161
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,844
what a pimp like you wants
for the trip of the girl anyway

162
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:33,889
 let's just say she's left
an impression on me

163
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,974
Make an offer?

164
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:46,276
yeah 200 gold in your
 pocket right now

165
00:24:49,113 --> 00:24:54,243
And you let my girls, my
purse to track her down.

166
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,720
I will be grateful to be rid of
 that conniving bitch

167
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,643
Okay. Leave.

168
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,479
 Leave

169
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:33,823
I want her back alive and unharmed

170
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:07,525
Teela, Teela I know you are
still mourning, but ...

171
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:12,655
Teela, Kishkumen murdered Caeryn ...

172
00:26:12,738 --> 00:26:16,993
Because he's going to unite the Darkspore
I need to stop him

173
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,704
Come with me.

174
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,541
Who are you, Marek?

175
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:27,712
Why do you seek
such dark magic?

176
00:26:28,045 --> 00:26:32,173
You used the same dark power
which killed my sister.

177
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:36,011
- It is a power that I do not understand.
- Or control

178
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,390
You were marked
by evil for all to see.

179
00:26:39,473 --> 00:26:42,602
Your foot is twisted
and cannot be healed

180
00:26:42,685 --> 00:26:45,623
you seek danger
 surrounded by evil

181
00:26:45,648 --> 00:26:47,964
You say you wish to be good.

182
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:53,862
You have no power over
 the darkness inside you.It calls you.

183
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:59,117
And in time it will claim you.
It is your fate.

184
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:05,458
- Sorry about Caeryn.
- I'll come with you.

185
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,297
And I will  report  you and I will deliver
 the Darkspore to Paladin.

186
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:14,132
He will know how best hide it.

187
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:41,743
Declare yourself.

188
00:27:43,537 --> 00:27:45,997
Declare yourself.

189
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,293
Beware of attack.

190
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,272
Go to Mineas and give them report it
Make haste.

191
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,525
Hold them off.

192
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,876
Teela I will tell you about
those  ten giants friendly loyal.

193
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,463
- Yes, several times. Yeah.
- Marek hasn't heard, have you?

194
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:02,717
- where you broke the Dragon?
- Ha, yes.

195
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,607
What's that sound?

196
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,503
It's elvish.

197
00:30:27,528 --> 00:30:31,564
 No, doesn't sound like
any elvish that I ever heard.

198
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,707
Someone' s in trouble.

199
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,210
Let's go have a look

200
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,172
- Get off me.
- Get off.

201
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,851
- Serious
- Nasty look figure.

202
00:30:53,894 --> 00:30:57,147
- cock or cock Indian
- cock Indian

203
00:30:57,231 --> 00:31:01,443
- We do not know who he is.
- Teela, we can find in this moment please

204
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:07,992
- Dagen and Thane,  with me?
- Now you're on your own on this one sweetheart.

205
00:31:33,726 --> 00:31:38,230
All right here we go
Let's go on this pass

206
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:41,191
Go and fight; shit.

207
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:01,502
- Dagen.
- Dagen,  come here.

208
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,389
- Come now with me.
- Dagen, do you  petrified there?

209
00:32:12,473 --> 00:32:18,728
If I get eaten by a pixie, just tell
Tell them it is a dragon or something.

210
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:19,980
Dagen.

211
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,325
What do you want from us, fairy ugly?

212
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:44,754
Come on, it won't be less
  it won't  be long.

213
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,349
Let's get him out of
here before they wake up.

214
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:26,296
Have you seen a man with
yellow  eyes stark off?

215
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,966
- I'm o the Garun-Dan.
- Fuck you all.

216
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,825
What would you know, half-breed?

217
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:35,620
Dagen.

218
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:48,068
The Garun-Dan were destroyed
and didn't mark their faces...

219
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:53,531
... like savages from the north.
You're not Garun-Dan.

220
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,993
Are we standing
in rocks all day?

221
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:59,996
- We're turning to the road of Mondiatha.
- Don't fucking tell him the mission.

222
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,249
Make caution with yellow eyes
who commands a horde of Orks.

223
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:07,462
- What did I say?
- His name Kishkumen. Do you know him?

224
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:11,716
don't be stupid, so no need to ask your question.
He did not even answer that,

225
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:15,095
I am close to the gods
I must warn this world into life

226
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:18,848
Before the tests
 replaces with them

227
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,726
How long have you wandered?
- Ten migrations of the Elch.

228
00:34:21,809 --> 00:34:23,604
- Alone?
- Thane.

229
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,483
- Don't lie to us, long-ears .
- I speak the truth.

230
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,235
There is no honour in lying.

231
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:39,952
You saved my life.
I owe you a life of that.

232
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:43,457
I'm bound to you until
 that debt is repaid.

233
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,710
Just one every girl once

234
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:49,671
He is lying by the way.

235
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:52,423
He's Dreucki they lay

236
00:34:53,217 --> 00:34:55,927
Probably planning on slitting
our throats tonight ...

237
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:59,723
And painting pictures
of it all over his face.

238
00:35:01,016 --> 00:35:02,850
You believe him?

239
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:07,313
I am telling you he is pure evil.

240
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,691
Good and evil are cross
 every living being

241
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:13,779
Of course not.
what tribe

242
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:24,372
- Are you sure about this?
- We can use him

243
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,381
- What's your name?
- Qole.

244
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:37,260
Qole, You do not owe me anything

245
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,431
I've been a slave and I will
not accept to enslave anyone

246
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:47,478
But you're more than welcome to join us.
Free

247
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:52,984
ِAll right, but give him a shirt.

248
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:03,453
The Dark elf dies a bloody, bloody death

249
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:15,299
Right there in the middle,
that is where my pile of gold is.

250
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:20,470
Our pile of gold.

251
00:36:24,099 --> 00:36:28,060
Something new?
- Shell of the cockatrice.

252
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:34,693
When use the right spell
you can turn flesh to stone.

253
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:38,947
I know a woman from Valencia
has the same power.

254
00:36:45,829 --> 00:36:47,497
Right.

255
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:56,130
vary with us some on else barrier

256
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:04,222
Right. What do you suppose this is?

257
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:15,942
- It has a heeling potion
- I'm not asking you Qole

258
00:37:16,026 --> 00:37:19,112
- I was hoping to offer it to you.
- From which you get that.

259
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:24,992
In Ogre cave.
Probably it is part from a temple

260
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:32,334
I might go and see where find Teela

261
00:37:33,961 --> 00:37:35,671
If you excuse me.

262
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,509
Very well,

263
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:47,057
Right. Harm a hair on her
head and I will find you.Dreucki

264
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:53,855
The crow's plucked out
his bonny, bonny eyes.

265
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:12,165
Why you stare me that way?

266
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,548
It pleases me.

267
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:35,605
An amulet, the legend of my people.

268
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,526
The sun follows the moon
until she slows

269
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:45,866
He lies next to her in the sky.
Before they part .

270
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:52,580
He draws the stars from her
and cast them into the night .

271
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:57,251
Telling everyone of their love.

272
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,796
It means a lot to you.

273
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,680
It was a gift from a woman.

274
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,110
Oh.

275
00:39:19,816 --> 00:39:24,153
My people no more slotted

276
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,534
I'm the last one

277
00:39:30,243 --> 00:39:34,288
So are your faces marked?
In remembrance?

278
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:39,920
I was raised by a shaman.

279
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:45,341
So are your faces marked?
In remembrance?

280
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,232
Goodnight, Marek.

281
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:34,933
Thank you for keeping watch.
- This daily bathing is unsafe.

282
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:38,102
The goddess demands it.

283
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,778
- Keep talking.
- About what?

284
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:52,700
- Tell me of your childhood.
- There's nothing to tell there.

285
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,494
Please.

286
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,374
My father was a soldier.

287
00:40:59,458 --> 00:41:04,086
I think I'd seen him twice in my life
before we got word he'd been killed.

288
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:06,755
We were put on the street.

289
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:10,551
I joined the army that
marched across the world

290
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:14,597
Ended up here,
long way from Mineas.

291
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,432
Are you from Mineas?

292
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:20,896
-  Is this capital very grand?
- I wouldn't say that.

293
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:26,942
Filth and shit, beggars.
However, there is a grand buildings, alright.

294
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:31,739
people grinding up against you ,
and they piss in the street

295
00:41:32,698 --> 00:41:36,660
- Then how you imagine it?
- More beautiful

296
00:41:36,828 --> 00:41:40,676
In fact  The Sun Goes Down

297
00:41:43,248 --> 00:41:44,922
The city starts to glow

298
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:47,671
You can hear the music.

299
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,092
You hear people laugh and sing.

300
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,555
And love.

301
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,153
Thane.

302
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,760
Sorry.

303
00:42:29,965 --> 00:42:33,760
- I am sorry, I am sorry.

304
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:39,933
It is so hard to find a woman
in privacy in this woods.

305
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:44,687
Put your sword away
You do not need it tonight.

306
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:46,730
Help!

307
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:49,961
Dagen wake up, come on.

308
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,472
Qole, my sword.

309
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,102
Can someone hand me my sword?

310
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:16,696
Oh ,oh. Good shot.

311
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:20,950
She's come with us.
The rest of you are free to leave

312
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:24,578
- You have to kill us first.
- Hey ; Hang on..

313
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,754
Oh .Gods. They are magnificent.

314
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:42,389
And she's good at the rope.
- Any of you bastards try to follow us.

315
00:44:42,471 --> 00:44:46,935
I cut your throat and spine.
You understand?

316
00:44:47,434 --> 00:44:49,771
Aphrodisiac.

317
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:53,857
- Damn
- Marek.

318
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:58,153
Marek. Marek.

319
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,158
Who are you and what
do you want with me?

320
00:45:02,242 --> 00:45:05,537
Our new master wants to meet you

321
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:12,293
And with the trouble you've been,
I intend to collect in full.

322
00:45:12,377 --> 00:45:14,671
 Tuen and Samos scintilla's.

323
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,682
There're men in the woods
Not Deirans and they have horses.

324
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:28,434
 Tuen and Samos scintilla's.

325
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:56,128
- I told you? Not Deirans.
- Why are Orks marching with men?

326
00:45:58,548 --> 00:46:01,176
Hey, over here.

327
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:15,857
 We will find you.

328
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,161
Marek.

329
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,165
You freed youselves?

330
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:40,297
Only thieves who can
 break away from the rope.

331
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:42,820
Qole frees us using Teela dagger.

332
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:44,409
Where are the bounty hunters?

333
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,887
They fought with troops Kishkumens.

334
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:49,891
They headed north,
Mondiatha purposes.

335
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:54,394
You recognize them only
by the eyes or their mole.

336
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,899
We must move quickly to catch them.

337
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:02,362
It's  two-day march.
We've got six hours to find it.

338
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:06,114
No , No It's not enough time to find
treasure buried in a city.

339
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:09,910
- Now inform me
- Orks track the Darkspore.

340
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:13,790
There is another way,
through  the mountains.

341
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,084
- Passing Donkerbos.
- How far is it?

342
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,753
In 12 hours we reach the place.

343
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:25,217
Passing at night,
residence swamp creatures.

344
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,638
- Do I need ask?
- No.

345
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,308
The stories to scare children.

346
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:36,645
If we meet about Kishkumen
and his whore in a straight bottom

347
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,273
We lose.

348
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,859
Aniset will there
the pass is sure.

349
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:45,153
Now  we can take the chances
 going into the long way road

350
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:49,158
All right. Who is in
 favor of the shortest?

351
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:56,790
It was your idea.

352
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,962
Yes, but it's not a good idea.

353
00:48:17,896 --> 00:48:21,648
I will go although
I did not raise my hand for.

354
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:58,937
This is a terrible,terrible idea.

355
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:01,897
This is more frightening than
story frightened children?

356
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,483
What it is frightening

357
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,678
We're being watched.

358
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:21,853
More than watched.

359
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:26,565
We're being followed.

360
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:13,315
- Aniset, hear my prayer.
- It's too late to call Aniset.

361
00:53:22,116 --> 00:53:23,283
No.

362
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,580
I go and do what you want

363
00:54:22,802 --> 00:54:25,596
You're mine.

364
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,229
Marek, release.

365
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,732
Release.

366
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,615
Release.

367
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,223
Teela, he needs your help.

368
00:55:52,308 --> 00:55:57,438
I cannot do anything...
I could not feel my fingers anymore.

369
00:55:57,813 --> 00:56:00,733
- Who knows what it does mean
- Who?

370
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,108
Kishkumen.

371
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,614
How ?

372
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:12,411
It's your doings. Now I do not
can shoot with my bow. It's your fault

373
00:56:12,495 --> 00:56:14,162
Tell the truth to them, Marek.

374
00:56:15,956 --> 00:56:18,833
He sensed me.

375
00:56:18,918 --> 00:56:21,669
When you used the magic...

376
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:25,049
He can feel my presence
 because he is a necromancer.

377
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:30,304
- So just like in the Ogre cave...
- I suck life force.

378
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:35,392
- Why did not you tell us.
- I could control it.

379
00:56:35,476 --> 00:56:37,394
- Tell them the truth.
- I can control

380
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,247
I would use it again.

381
00:56:40,272 --> 00:56:43,882
Then heal him.
your dark magic is too strong.

382
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:47,445
I should not join you.

383
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,990
I saved your life.

384
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:56,162
And take my hand has many benefits.

385
00:56:56,705 --> 00:57:01,376
Remember that it's something
 that you cannot control.

386
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:03,504
I saved your life.

387
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:08,467
Maybe you saved
to suck life.

388
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:17,308
- Hold, hold.
- Dagen. Dagen.

389
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,271
Dagen. Hold.

390
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,566
Hey...

391
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,361
Hey...

392
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:48,673
Fuck you  Dreucki.
would like dark evil and damaged

393
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:56,389
Enough.
We do not have time for this.

394
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:00,310
We have to move.

395
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,814
Hey.

396
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,863
Come, Teela, we have to move.

397
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:02,706
- We need to rest.
- No time.

398
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:46,040
You saved them.

399
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:49,752
I will kill them.

400
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,924
They hate me.

401
00:59:56,302 --> 00:59:58,637
They are afraid of you.

402
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:02,724
Some could feel the dark side...

403
01:00:02,808 --> 01:00:05,477
because they are afraid
of being close to you today

404
01:00:05,561 --> 01:00:10,316
What should I do?
Or we will die?

405
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,944
There's always another way.

406
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:17,240
Marek.

407
01:00:18,907 --> 01:00:23,704
There is no destiny can be fixed.
The gods will help

408
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:29,501
You're strong.
You've been chosen.

409
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:33,898
This was once a great city.

410
01:01:33,982 --> 01:01:38,152
They thought they could
lure their gods from heaven. by treasure

411
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:42,408
Instead earthquakes to dust
and he buried them all.

412
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,650
Their mistakes are stockpiled wealth...

413
01:01:45,675 --> 01:01:47,936
 And the treasure will spending then

414
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:51,338
The entrance is on side around this place

415
01:01:51,363 --> 01:01:52,650
We proceed.

416
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:20,946
- Just like that?
- Maybe this entrance.

417
01:02:21,155 --> 01:02:26,368
- Maybe only rock and sand.
- It look Sathuan.

418
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:29,663
I read a lot about it  when I was child

419
01:02:39,173 --> 01:02:42,216
It Zwerfpad stone.

420
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:48,765
The others are in the four elements
 of the worship in Mondiatha

421
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:53,895
This mark is on the map,
 but there is no spell to open it.

422
01:03:05,199 --> 01:03:07,575
He was so strong.

423
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:21,131
That symbol of the archway
there is also on the map.

424
01:03:21,757 --> 01:03:24,842
But such symbols,
I can not recognize it

425
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:30,014
It's five points and five stones.

426
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:36,460
Marek, I need
to speak with you.

427
01:03:36,485 --> 01:03:40,049
We are very close to the end Teela

428
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:43,152
We'll talk on the way home
after we have the stone.

429
01:03:43,237 --> 01:03:47,115
- I need to say now.
- Then say .

430
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,010
you said  a hundred of that already
and said it repeatedly.

431
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,119
What?

432
01:03:51,453 --> 01:03:54,248
- You blame me for Caeryn's death .
- That what I ask you to say

433
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:56,917
-And it's the truth.
- And you're right.

434
01:03:58,709 --> 01:04:02,922
I am necromancer
and I could not control it.

435
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,149
When Darkspore being there and...

436
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:08,451
 I touched it,
Kishkumen will see

437
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:12,474
Something in me pulled me into
and strength increases every day.

438
01:04:12,558 --> 01:04:15,351
I'm not sure I can resist.

439
01:04:15,435 --> 01:04:19,022
- We have come in this way .
- I did not go with you.

440
01:04:19,106 --> 01:04:21,066
You must keep you away from me.

441
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:25,529
The Darkspore
can destroy us all

442
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:47,986
You know, I say this feel the priests.

443
01:05:48,653 --> 01:05:53,700
What you see have the trace that
we can not imagine it  in other way.

444
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:57,161
Sorry buddy.

445
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,557
Stop.

446
01:06:18,141 --> 01:06:22,771
- Qole, I need your help.

447
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:26,358
Well, It is that simple?

448
01:06:28,568 --> 01:06:30,361
Qole.

449
01:06:32,947 --> 01:06:34,907
- Qole.
- Let me go.

450
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:42,415
It's simple
It is simple

451
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:49,547
She started
She finally  lost her mind.

452
01:07:08,942 --> 01:07:11,611
- Portal is open.

453
01:07:53,528 --> 01:07:57,407
You will see anyway  necromancer.
He sense you here.

454
01:07:58,825 --> 01:08:01,577
Well done, Marek.

455
01:08:02,037 --> 01:08:07,876
Always stepping in front or behind,
never far from each other

456
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:13,589
My master have seen you in the dark
 Marek the slave girl.

457
01:08:14,966 --> 01:08:17,468
But you do not know
who you are, Do you?

458
01:08:19,804 --> 01:08:23,015
Szorlok have a great purposes for you.

459
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:28,688
Drop your weapons.

460
01:08:31,398 --> 01:08:37,279
In time he will show you
who he really is and you becoming.

461
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:41,200
Now you will save me from
 the troubles to collect the stone

462
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,538
We will  not serve you  Szorlok.

463
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:49,876
Yes you will serve.
Whether the live or the death

464
01:08:50,417 --> 01:08:53,088
Just like your sister's death.

465
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:02,514
Necromancer, you will  go retrieve
  the stone and deliver it to me

466
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,641
-... or your friend will die.
- Do not, Marek.

467
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:10,438
There is no love for your
 sister I see. Very well.

468
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,357
- I'll go.
- But Marek...

469
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:17,027
- I have no choice.
- Then we all go together.

470
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:20,281
Marek, you will be lost.

471
01:09:21,574 --> 01:09:23,994
And show the dark will rise...

472
01:09:25,828 --> 01:09:28,497
- No, no.
- Marek.

473
01:09:29,081 --> 01:09:34,212
The poison united with her blood
with a sense terrible pain as a result.

474
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:36,964
Until  it reaches her heart

475
01:09:37,048 --> 01:09:41,051
But I will heal
if you return the stone.

476
01:09:41,135 --> 01:09:46,141
You have about two hours.
So.I suggest you make your decision quickly

477
01:09:46,224 --> 01:09:48,185
We have to go now.

478
01:09:48,267 --> 01:09:51,228
We will go.
Let's go.

479
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:58,236
Come on, dagen.

480
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:05,284
I will tie to you all
Marek, you'll be lost.

481
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:38,692
- black is pitch
- Briefly.

482
01:10:42,197 --> 01:10:45,408
 Tempus Alorus luminescent.

483
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:57,796
 Tempus Alorus luminescent.

484
01:11:16,064 --> 01:11:18,942
That way.

485
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:26,783
 And the good fairy find
Sacs and sacs full of gold.

486
01:11:26,865 --> 01:11:29,243
Silent, Dagen.

487
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,981
There is a door over head.

488
01:11:35,006 --> 01:11:38,359
With a lot of gold in
behind it, I hope.

489
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:47,971
- What's that sound?
- Mouse.

490
01:11:49,222 --> 01:11:50,639
let's go

491
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:54,394
Are you sure it was a rat?

492
01:11:54,686 --> 01:11:57,105
The sound is amplified through the tunnel.

493
01:11:57,855 --> 01:12:02,776
Do not worry, Dagen.
His voice was strong as many others.

494
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:21,838
Get away from me.

495
01:12:29,803 --> 01:12:33,183
It's not a rat.
This is a dog monster.

496
01:12:33,682 --> 01:12:34,920
You have a chance ; You know.

497
01:12:34,945 --> 01:12:38,586
Once revoke straight sword lying here.

498
01:12:38,646 --> 01:12:41,732
And this is only by
a rogue priest notice.

499
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:45,153
If I kill you,
I do with pleasure.

500
01:12:45,904 --> 01:12:48,947
Kill me?
What you talking about?

501
01:12:53,620 --> 01:12:56,789
Let's keep moving

502
01:13:07,384 --> 01:13:11,470
Ogre, rats ,
hordes of orks.

503
01:13:11,554 --> 01:13:14,932
Why is it always so complicated?

504
01:13:18,978 --> 01:13:20,854
Hello?

505
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:38,997
He was still alive,
but he was not breathing.

506
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:44,045
- He's sleeping.
- Sleeping? What do you mean sleep?

507
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,091
Place is cursed.

508
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,344
You cannot trust your senses here.

509
01:13:52,512 --> 01:13:54,806
We have to keep moving.

510
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:58,768
Mind should be clear 
and just think our task.

511
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:02,229
ًWe can tie ourselves together.

512
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:05,816
If a person is asleep,
the other must be pulled.

513
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,880
I do not want to bind myself to anyone.

514
01:14:07,885 --> 01:14:09,210
Silence.

515
01:14:10,904 --> 01:14:14,742
This is the first intersection.
The door is this way

516
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:18,246
Good knot.

517
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,550
It is a magic wand, huh?

518
01:14:31,634 --> 01:14:35,053
I know someone
needs it more than you.

519
01:14:42,478 --> 01:14:46,900
I do not understand.
It is not in the map.

520
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,651
Oh, giants

521
01:14:51,446 --> 01:14:55,574
They must have fled here
when the place is buried.

522
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:59,996
Place is cold, isolated place to die
.

523
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:05,835
Do you think they know it
will destroy their world?

524
01:15:07,294 --> 01:15:10,340
Maybe they think , they can stop it.

525
01:15:10,423 --> 01:15:12,799
He did not love you.

526
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:38,784
 -Let's we report.
- Everyone is dead.

527
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,828
 - Who's there?
- We must withdraw.

528
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:43,920
 No one is here
They All are dead.

529
01:15:43,921 --> 01:15:45,566
 Tell me your name!

530
01:15:54,259 --> 01:15:56,718
Come on, keep on the road.

531
01:16:07,750 --> 01:16:08,910
Come on.

532
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:22,160
There should be a door here.
This is the end.

533
01:16:43,599 --> 01:16:48,062
I can feel,
we are close.

534
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:56,612
I could feel the stone Darkspore.

535
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,978
This is one,
There must be more.

536
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:36,527
Hello, sunshine.

537
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:03,596
Treasure Mondiatha.

538
01:18:14,690 --> 01:18:17,610
Why stir treasure?

539
01:18:20,612 --> 01:18:23,240
This is really deceptive.

540
01:18:31,665 --> 01:18:33,751
Oh, shit.

541
01:18:37,422 --> 01:18:38,965
Oh, shit.

542
01:18:39,506 --> 01:18:43,343
Dagen, we have no
 time for their wealth

543
01:18:44,262 --> 01:18:46,012
Run.

544
01:18:55,022 --> 01:18:58,151
- Maybe he's not real.
- No, he was real.

545
01:18:58,234 --> 01:19:00,903
This way.
Through this way.

546
01:19:00,986 --> 01:19:03,905
We have to back ,
we have to find the stone

547
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:07,034
Finding the stone, we will die

548
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:09,287
Hold this.

549
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,794
I smell fresh air.
Help me up

550
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,309
Hurry up, Dagen.

551
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:38,064
This way.

552
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:45,947
Looks just like essay to escape
 from the mother's womb

553
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,639
Run.

554
01:20:11,890 --> 01:20:14,143
Dagen, I fight him quikly

555
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:18,104
Hurry up he is behind us,
dragon is also looking for me.

556
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:47,092
I think Darkspore keep the dragon alive.

557
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:51,556
- Perhaps this can help us?
 - Schasaat.

558
01:20:53,391 --> 01:20:56,560
- Save it for the dragon.
- What is that?

559
01:20:57,269 --> 01:21:00,397
If this is successful.
We can distract him...

560
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:03,192
I would shoot him with this stick.

561
01:21:03,276 --> 01:21:04,734
Go all surround him

562
01:21:04,819 --> 01:21:07,320
Or you flick it safe
when would you talk

563
01:21:07,405 --> 01:21:11,075
- It's a good plan, Marek.
- Without darkspore he will killed

564
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:13,743
Run, coward.
It is that a dragon or my sword.

565
01:21:13,827 --> 01:21:16,247
You'll be a fucking hero,
Qole while doing all this.

566
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:18,791
Spread or all will die.

567
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:32,971
Hey, come get me.
If you can, ugly.

568
01:21:41,647 --> 01:21:43,064
 Schasaat.

569
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:18,183
 Schasaat.

570
01:22:22,563 --> 01:22:24,356
 Schasaat.

571
01:22:45,753 --> 01:22:47,296
Marek.

572
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,278
Dagen.

573
01:23:13,447 --> 01:23:14,948
Qole.

574
01:23:22,498 --> 01:23:24,500
Hey.

575
01:23:26,377 --> 01:23:28,795
Come and get me.

576
01:23:29,838 --> 01:23:32,591
- He came.
- Be careful, Marek.

577
01:23:36,678 --> 01:23:38,556
 Miamortile odillus rittik.

578
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:59,660
 Bring Darkspore me.
Obey me.

579
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:13,674
You're still alive.

580
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:17,887
Fuck me ; Be careful next time.

581
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,055
you welcome

582
01:24:25,226 --> 01:24:28,104
I'm good without
the kisses, thank you.

583
01:24:29,105 --> 01:24:33,194
Take the Darkspore.
Run and do not look back.

584
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,028
Another way as Gojun pass

585
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:40,450
ِAll the treasures left behind there...

586
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:44,497
This is the one piece left

587
01:24:44,580 --> 01:24:47,833
take it put it into the sun

588
01:24:49,292 --> 01:24:53,589
- Just one more shot.
- To save Teela.

589
01:24:53,631 --> 01:24:58,635
Nothing like selfless.
And there is no end for you.

590
01:25:29,208 --> 01:25:32,544
Darkness will take this time.

591
01:25:34,964 --> 01:25:39,176
The only absolute powers
in this world is death.

592
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:45,683
Goddess of light, hear my prayer.

593
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:51,689
Fill me with your presence and
Let me die, please.

594
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:57,277
You will surely die, but not
without friends as witnesses.

595
01:26:04,409 --> 01:26:09,414
You have touched it. I can tell.
Its power lingers with you still.

596
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,000
Where is off?

597
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:16,005
He was buried with sand.

598
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:19,174
Your honor our agreement and heal her

599
01:26:19,258 --> 01:26:23,262
You would trade what matters
most for what matters least.

600
01:26:23,344 --> 01:26:26,182
It is too important to sacrifice.

601
01:26:27,016 --> 01:26:30,352
Or cover your lies.

602
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:44,658
- Where Darkspore?
- We have never found it.

603
01:26:44,742 --> 01:26:48,537
- Stop it, stop it.
- That is enough.

604
01:26:56,045 --> 01:27:01,466
I date you to pay Shoman,
 Release me from my badge

605
01:27:03,384 --> 01:27:06,487
You've served me well, my child

606
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:08,790
You're free now.

607
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:12,788
You are fucking bastard, already
I told you.

608
01:27:12,813 --> 01:27:14,544
Do not trust him.

609
01:27:14,939 --> 01:27:18,107
They have already done so.
Let them free.

610
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,070
Where is our money?

611
01:27:25,032 --> 01:27:27,618
- No.
- You gave your word

612
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:29,452
No.

613
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:45,009
 Marek, I know you.

614
01:27:57,648 --> 01:28:01,901
 What should I do?
We will die.

615
01:28:03,945 --> 01:28:06,239
 There's always another way.

616
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:16,874
 Schasaat.

617
01:28:23,007 --> 01:28:25,049
Kill them.

618
01:32:33,839 --> 01:32:39,137
You cannot escape.
I will be back.

619
01:32:46,562 --> 01:32:48,688
I'm sorry, Marek.

620
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:57,822
Remember ; what  I said to you

621
01:32:59,366 --> 01:33:01,994
The fate is not waiting

622
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:32,042
- What happened?
- Raw time that what happened

623
01:34:32,958 --> 01:34:35,878
You can fix and save bodies?

624
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:41,218
I can save everyone obeys

625
01:34:41,300 --> 01:34:44,721
- He escaped with the Darkspore.
- We failed.

626
01:35:42,153 --> 01:35:46,616
You're not wrong to believe and hope.

627
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:50,912
your suffering is nothing

628
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:01,254
If we are not fighting this darkness,...

629
01:36:01,279 --> 01:36:04,158
we will be part of it

630
01:36:04,509 --> 01:36:07,011
Caeryn said so.

631
01:36:07,261 --> 01:36:11,641
And you do not stop
against darkness, Marek.

632
01:36:14,852 --> 01:36:20,525
I was wrong.
There is goodness in you.

633
01:36:21,567 --> 01:36:23,486
And you're so strong.

634
01:36:24,780 --> 01:36:27,490
And your struggle has just begun.

635
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:43,672
where we go ?

636
01:36:45,258 --> 01:36:48,959
