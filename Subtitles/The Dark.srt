You have to pay for that.

4
00:02:51,565 --> 00:02:53,334
I'll buy it.

5
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,715
We're here.

6
00:03:09,249 --> 00:03:12,754
This is what
you're looking for.

7
00:03:17,191 --> 00:03:19,794
So you like scary stories,
do you?

8
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:27,369
Yeah, I get people like you
in here from time to time.

9
00:03:29,604 --> 00:03:31,337
What's wrong,

10
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,175
big city not exciting
enough for you?

11
00:03:34,844 --> 00:03:37,878
You gotta get your kicks
driving all the way up here,

12
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,883
pokin' your nose in
where it don't belong?

13
00:03:41,584 --> 00:03:43,751
Didn't your momma
ever tell you,

14
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:46,589
curiosity killed the cat?

15
00:03:51,226 --> 00:03:52,860
I'm in a kind of a hurry,

16
00:03:52,862 --> 00:03:54,764
if you don't mind.

17
00:04:02,438 --> 00:04:04,674
Yes sir,

18
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:09,677
Devil's Den sure has
its share of scary stories,

19
00:04:09,679 --> 00:04:11,614
I'll tell you what.

20
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:16,185
You know the thing
I like about those stories?

21
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:23,860
It's not me up in those woods,
running for my life.

22
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:27,395
It's not me
being torn to pieces

23
00:04:27,397 --> 00:04:29,700
before my very own eyes.

24
00:04:30,434 --> 00:04:34,669
No sir,
I'm at home.

25
00:04:34,671 --> 00:04:37,940
And that scary stuff...

26
00:04:37,942 --> 00:04:40,475
that's always happening
to folks like...

27

34
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:31,864
Where's the goshdarn map?!

35
00:05:48,982 --> 00:05:50,716
No.

36
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,893
No!

37
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:11,469
Mein herz ist klein,
lass niemand herein,

38
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,706
als dich mein liebes Jesulein.

39
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,508
Mein herz ist klein,
lass niemand herein,

40
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,047
als dich mein liebes Jesulein.

41
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:23,148
Mein herz ist klein,
lass niemand herein,

42
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,652
als dich mein liebes Jesulein.

43
00:07:50,473 --> 00:07:51,908
It's fine.

44
00:07:52,875 --> 00:07:54,777
Just relax.

45
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,682
It's fine.

46
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:02,932
Hello?

47
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:39,415
Ah! Ah!

48
00:21:50,971 --> 00:21:52,839
Josef?

49
00:22:00,114 --> 00:22:01,579
Sorry.
I'm sorry!

50
00:22:01,581 --> 00:22:03,050
I love you, Josef!

51
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:08,487
I stayed under the blanket
the entire time.

52
00:22:08,489 --> 00:22:10,558
I swear to God,
I stayed under the blanket.

53
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:15,928
I swear to God,

54
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:18,332
I stayed under the blanket
the entire time.

55
00:22:23,671 --> 00:22:25,873
You were just gone so long.

56
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:31,980
I... I started to think
that maybe something...

57
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:36,317
No!

58
00:22:36,885 --> 00:22:38,885
Josef?!

59
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,355
Josef! Josef!

60
00:22:43,424 --> 00:22:44,860
He's gone!

61
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,461
He's gone.

62
00:24:07,511 --> 00:24:08,712
Don't look.

63
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,554
You should really
dress warmer.

64
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:55,061
Especially gloves.

65
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,766
I've never felt hands
so cold.

66
00:25:11,244 --> 00:25:13,779
Josef will be back soon.

67
00:25:16,083 --> 00:25:20,954
Please... don't tell
Josef about my pants.

68
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:25,892
He'd be very upset.

69
00:28:33,452 --> 00:28:35,287
Go to bed, Mina.

70
00:28:39,425 --> 00:28:41,427
What is he doing here?

71
00:28:42,295 --> 00:28:44,061
Isn't she just lovely?

72
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,372
You said he wasn't
coming back.

73
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,212
The apple of my fucking eye.

74
00:29:01,548 --> 00:29:03,347
Go to bed, Mina.

75
00:29:03,349 --> 00:29:04,949
Now!

["For The Damaged"

77
00:31:38,576 --> 00:31:40,344
He's here?

78
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,180
Hey! Stop!
Stop!

79
00:31:45,182 --> 00:31:47,084
It's against the rules!

80
00:31:47,518 --> 00:31:49,053
<i>Hello?</i>

81
00:31:49,487 --> 00:31:51,353
Stop!

82
00:31:51,355 --> 00:31:53,290
Josef is coming!

83

<i>Hey Nate,
you alive out there?</i>

84
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:02,732
Hey Angie,
sorry about that.

85
00:32:02,734 --> 00:32:04,434
I was following that map
from Harry's place

86
00:32:04,436 --> 00:32:06,204
and I got a flat tire.

87
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:08,371
<i>Well, why didn't you say so?</i>

88
00:32:08,373 --> 00:32:10,242
<i>Where are you?
I'll come pick you up.</i>

89
00:32:10,575 --> 00:32:12,577
I'm up in Devil's Den.

90
00:32:17,282 --> 00:32:18,448
Angie?

91
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:20,383
<i>Yeah, sorry... I'll...</i>

92
00:32:20,385 --> 00:32:22,185
<i>I'll get someone up there
to help ASAP.</i>

93
00:32:22,187 --> 00:32:24,322
<i>Just hang tight.</i>

94
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:29,325
Hey Angie, what was the make
of that car we're looking for?

95
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:32,598
<i>2001 Subaru Outback,
maroon.</i>

96
00:32:33,766 --> 00:32:35,368
<i>Why?</i>

97
00:32:35,468 --> 00:32:37,470
Keep me updated
on that tow.

98
00:32:50,116 --> 00:32:51,350
Hey!

99
00:32:52,485 --> 00:32:54,420
You okay?

100
00:32:58,224 --> 00:33:00,293
You are Alex Whitman, right?

101
00:33:03,229 --> 00:33:06,332
If you had any idea how many
people are looking for you?

102
00:33:08,635 --> 00:33:10,034
Are you alone?

103
00:33:13,507 --> 00:33:16,174
It's okay,
I'm a police officer,

104
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:17,644
I'm gonna get you
out of here.

105
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:19,878
My car's just down the hill.

106
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,380
It's got a flat tire, but my
partner is just on the way.

107
00:33:22,382 --> 00:33:24,318
He went to the house.

108
00:33:28,155 --> 00:33:30,123
What's that now?

109
00:33:31,692 --> 00:33:33,728
Jesus!

110
00:33:35,095 --> 00:33:37,699
He's in the house.

111
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:52,112
<i>This is the police!</i>

112
00:33:52,213 --> 00:33:54,649
<i>Just come out
with your hands up, Josef!</i>

113
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,605
Whoa.

114
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:17,634
Hofer, you are in there?

115
00:35:23,941 --> 00:35:25,610
I found the boy.

116
00:35:26,544 --> 00:35:27,845
It's over.

117
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:33,618
You have until
the count of three.

118
00:35:35,553 --> 00:35:37,455
I will shoot.

119
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,495
One...

120
00:35:47,665 --> 00:35:49,634
This is not a game.

121
00:35:55,206 --> 00:35:56,842
Two...

122
00:36:00,545 --> 00:36:02,681
Goddam it.

123
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:11,857
Hey.

124
00:36:13,458 --> 00:36:14,924
Ah!

125
00:36:28,573 --> 00:36:30,777
Back-up!
I need back-up!

126
00:36:31,778 --> 00:36:33,309
<i>Nate?
What's wrong?</i>

127
00:36:33,311 --> 00:36:34,712
I need your help... please!

128
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,312
It's not him.
It's coming for me.

129
00:36:36,314 --> 00:36:37,882
I don't know what it is,
but it's not human.

130
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:39,884
<i>Nate, slow down.
I can't understand...</i>

131
00:36:39,886 --> 00:36:41,719
It's not human!

132
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:47,992
<i>Nate! Nate!</i>

133
00:36:47,994 --> 00:36:50,196
<i>Talk to me!
Nate!</i>

134
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:18,053
Big mistake.

135
00:38:21,791 --> 00:38:23,659
Bring me to Josef!

136
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,995
I hate you!

137
00:38:26,662 --> 00:38:28,462
Ah!

138
00:38:28,464 --> 00:38:29,730
He's dead!

139
00:38:29,732 --> 00:38:31,667
Josef's dead!

140
00:38:47,717 --> 00:38:49,519
You know where he is,
don't you?

141
00:38:58,528 --> 00:38:59,761
Whatever I did,
I'm sorry.

142
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:02,430
Just please,
please take me to Josef.

143
00:39:02,432 --> 00:39:03,998
Then we'll leave.

144
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,635
We'll leave you alone.
We'll never come back.

145
00:39:07,637 --> 00:39:09,040
Stop!

146
00:39:16,713 --> 00:39:19,349
Why wouldn't you
just go away?

147
00:39:20,818 --> 00:39:22,954
Why won't you
just leave me alone?

148
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:29,859
There's a number
I need to call

149
00:39:29,861 --> 00:39:32,730
if something bad
ever happens to Josef.

150
00:39:33,731 --> 00:39:34,630
That's the rule.

151
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:36,599
I don't care about
your stupid rules.

152
00:39:36,601 --> 00:39:38,136
They'll come get me.

153
00:39:38,903 --> 00:39:41,204
Josef's friends.

154
00:39:41,206 --> 00:39:44,207
They'll come here
and get me... and...

155
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:46,144
Stop talking.

156
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:49,882
- We leave you alone...
- Stop talking!

157
00:40:00,659 --> 00:40:02,160
The others?

158
00:40:03,161 --> 00:40:05,365
They'll follow.

159
00:40:05,797 --> 00:40:07,900
They always follow.

160
00:40:08,634 --> 00:40:11,036
- If you're lying to me...
- I'm not.

161
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:19,611
I promise.

162
00:40:43,636 --> 00:40:46,206
I'm Alex,
by the way.

163
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:57,851
These woods are cursed,
you know.

164
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:03,023
Why do you think they
call it Devil's Den?

165
00:41:05,092 --> 00:41:07,192
There's this monster
that roams around,

166
00:41:07,194 --> 00:41:10,731
stalking the woods, hungry
for human flesh and bone.

167
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:14,835
It used to be, you know,
like, you and me...

168
00:41:15,602 --> 00:41:17,238
But then, something
bad happened to it.

169
00:41:18,539 --> 00:41:20,208
Something really bad.

170
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,748
They say it has
claws like knives,

171
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,318
that it uses to tear
people apart,

172
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,522
like, arms and legs
flying everywhere...

173
00:41:35,957 --> 00:41:37,857
And that it uses
its razor-sharp teeth

174
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,059
to bite into people's hearts
while they're still beating,

175
00:41:40,061 --> 00:41:41,997
just so they can watch
the moment they die.

176
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:44,799
You won't scare me.

177
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,166
Ask anyone.

178
00:41:47,168 --> 00:41:48,837
She's real.

179
00:41:50,905 --> 00:41:52,707
So, it's a she?

180
00:41:56,745 --> 00:41:57,810
Wait.

181
00:42:02,051 --> 00:42:03,150
Listen.

182
00:42:10,092 --> 00:42:12,161
You promised.

183
00:42:19,235 --> 00:42:21,003
They're getting closer.

184
00:42:24,106 --> 00:42:25,808
Hold on to me.

185
00:42:41,724 --> 00:42:43,224
Why are we stopping?

186
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:50,700
<i>Down here!</i>

187
00:43:08,985 --> 00:43:10,054
Wait!

188
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:12,323
Wait.

189
00:43:16,693 --> 00:43:18,362
- What was that?
- Shh!

190
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,242
<i>You got anything there?</i>

191
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,746
<i>Hey, have you
gotten any signals?</i>

192
00:43:37,748 --> 00:43:40,651
<i>Hey, over here!
Keep moving!</i>

193
00:44:31,137 --> 00:44:33,239
We should keep moving?

194
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:37,341
They won't find us here.

195
00:44:37,343 --> 00:44:39,511
We've been here for hours.

196
00:44:39,513 --> 00:44:42,349
- We need to find a phone...
- Enough with the phone!

197
00:44:49,055 --> 00:44:51,125
We'll go in the morning.

198
00:44:53,527 --> 00:44:55,362
I'm starving.

199
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:02,136
Josef promised he will get
me cereal yesterday but...

200
00:45:08,242 --> 00:45:10,311
Do you know Josef?

201
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,982
No.

202
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,152
Why do you think he's dead?

203
00:45:21,822 --> 00:45:23,757
I saw him.

204
00:45:25,227 --> 00:45:27,527
But if you don't know him,
how do you know it was him?

205
00:45:27,529 --> 00:45:29,395
It was him.

206
00:45:29,397 --> 00:45:31,333
It could've been anybody.

207
00:46:13,175 --> 00:46:15,878
He didn't smoke or anything.
He just...

208
00:46:17,313 --> 00:46:19,815
He liked to burn things.

209
00:46:24,987 --> 00:46:26,956
He did that to you?

210
00:46:29,559 --> 00:46:31,827
It wasn't his fault.

211
00:46:33,330 --> 00:46:35,330
He told me...

212
00:46:35,332 --> 00:46:38,801
bad things would happen,
if I... if I...

213
00:46:45,442 --> 00:46:47,844
I was still learning
the rules.

214
00:46:54,485 --> 00:46:58,088
There's one...
when we are in the car?

215
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:02,293
I have to keep on
my invisibility blanket.

216
00:47:03,261 --> 00:47:10,301
And if I'm completely covered
and really, really still...

217
00:47:11,336 --> 00:47:13,304
I go invisible.

218
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:18,876
I know it's not real, but...
I don't know...

219
00:47:20,645 --> 00:47:22,880
I always liked that one.

220
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:36,260
You can have it.

221
00:47:49,141 --> 00:47:51,708
What you were telling about

222
00:47:51,710 --> 00:47:55,579
these woods being
haunted or whatever...

223
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:58,217
you really believe it's true?

224
00:48:00,018 --> 00:48:02,087
I know it is.

225
00:48:06,426 --> 00:48:08,561
So you believe in monsters?

226
00:48:12,164 --> 00:48:13,433
Yeah.

227
00:48:14,401 --> 00:48:16,202
Me too.

228
00:48:27,447 --> 00:48:29,315
It's Mina.

229
00:48:31,084 --> 00:48:32,550
What?

230
00:48:32,552 --> 00:48:35,021
My name.

231
00:49:26,675 --> 00:49:29,377
What did I tell you
about locking the door?

232
00:49:37,352 --> 00:49:39,354
What did I say?

233
00:49:40,455 --> 00:49:41,724
Don't.

234
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:45,427
Good.

235
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:51,099
That's good.

236
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:53,569
It's okay.

237
00:50:03,846 --> 00:50:06,082
You like that?

238
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:12,319
I bet those boys at school

239
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:14,490
can't touch you
like that, huh?

240
00:50:18,695 --> 00:50:20,564
Tell me how much
you like it.

241
00:50:23,767 --> 00:50:25,602
Don't make me ask.

242
00:50:27,471 --> 00:50:29,171
Tell me.

243
00:50:32,174 --> 00:50:34,076
Tell me.

244
00:50:38,148 --> 00:50:39,347
I like it.

245
00:50:39,349 --> 00:50:41,285
Yeah?

246
00:50:44,588 --> 00:50:46,187
I like it.

247
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:48,292
Damn, girl.
What's gotten into you.

248
00:50:49,426 --> 00:50:51,128
Ah!
Fuck!

249
00:50:51,896 --> 00:50:54,331
You fucking...

250
00:50:56,634 --> 00:50:58,201
Mina, stop.

251
00:50:58,736 --> 00:51:00,371
Stop!

252
00:51:01,472 --> 00:51:02,840
Stop!

253
00:51:03,173 --> 00:51:04,440
Stop!

254
00:51:51,925 --> 00:51:53,292
Mina.

255
00:51:58,263 --> 00:52:01,133
Mina, it's me,
it's Alex.

256
00:52:15,682 --> 00:52:17,417
Are you okay?

257
00:52:18,685 --> 00:52:20,121
Yeah.

258
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:29,830
Nightmares?

259
00:52:32,265 --> 00:52:33,600
Me too.

260
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,237
- Your hands...
- Yeah.

261
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,438
They're cold,
I get it.

262
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,444
No... they're not.

263
00:52:59,293 --> 00:53:00,392
Wait here.

264
00:53:00,394 --> 00:53:01,863
Where are you going?

265
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,732
To find your stupid phone.

266
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:42,770
<i>George, what are you doing?</i>

267
00:53:42,772 --> 00:53:45,240
<i>Can someone hold this stuff,
I have to take a leak.</i>

268
00:53:46,508 --> 00:53:48,911
I still don't see
what you need a knife for.

269
00:53:49,377 --> 00:53:50,711
There's three of us
against one of him.

270
00:53:50,713 --> 00:53:51,879
What's he gonna do?

271
00:53:51,881 --> 00:53:54,717
Did you hear what the cops
said he did to poor Nate.

272
00:53:55,585 --> 00:53:57,451
Ripped his throat clean
out of his friggin' head.

273
00:53:57,453 --> 00:53:59,086
That's bullshit.

274
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:01,822
They're just saying that
so they scare folks off,

275
00:54:01,824 --> 00:54:03,524
have less competition
for the reward.

276
00:54:03,526 --> 00:54:05,793
Look, I'm just sayin',
that's what I heard.

277
00:54:05,795 --> 00:54:07,296
<i>It's not bullshit.</i>

278
00:54:10,433 --> 00:54:13,068
We've all heard the stories
about this place!

279
00:54:13,070 --> 00:54:15,304
What ever it is,
it's out there.

280
00:54:15,571 --> 00:54:18,907
A normal person
did not do that to Nate.

281
00:54:18,909 --> 00:54:20,776
Jesus, George,
for the last time...

282
00:54:20,778 --> 00:54:24,646
Look, I know what I am
talking about, okay.

283
00:54:24,648 --> 00:54:26,548
I know more about
this place than anyone.

284
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:28,416
I already told you,
if you're wanna tag along

285
00:54:28,418 --> 00:54:30,719
I don't want to hear no more
about ghosts or goblins

286
00:54:30,721 --> 00:54:32,587
or any of that crap.

287
00:54:32,589 --> 00:54:33,855
We're all are here
with one plan

288
00:54:33,857 --> 00:54:35,490
and one plan only:

289
00:54:35,492 --> 00:54:37,626
that is to find Hofer
and the kid,

290
00:54:37,628 --> 00:54:40,330
bring him back to the Sheriff
and collect the reward.

291
00:54:40,731 --> 00:54:42,664
<i>Now if you wanna
try to be useful</i>

292
00:54:42,666 --> 00:54:44,867
<i>you help me set up
camp over there.</i>

293
00:54:44,869 --> 00:54:46,570
<i>I'm starving.</i>

294
00:55:04,022 --> 00:55:06,324
Where are we going anyway?

295
00:55:13,631 --> 00:55:14,699
Mina?

296
00:55:18,870 --> 00:55:20,738
Mina?

297
00:55:24,176 --> 00:55:26,411
Mina?!

298
00:55:31,784 --> 00:55:33,619
<i>It was coming
from over here.</i>

299
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:44,463
Alex?

300
00:55:46,632 --> 00:55:48,601
Alex Whitman?

301
00:55:49,501 --> 00:55:52,105
Hey, uh,
it's okay, son.

302
00:55:53,139 --> 00:55:55,474
Don't worry, you're safe.

303
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,542
My name is Theo

304
00:55:58,544 --> 00:56:00,812
and this is my brother,
Henry.

305
00:56:00,814 --> 00:56:02,647
And my son, George.

306
00:56:02,649 --> 00:56:05,051
No, I'm not Alex.

307
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:08,653
You're wrong.
Go away!

308
00:56:08,655 --> 00:56:09,854
Calm down now, kid.

309
00:56:09,856 --> 00:56:11,923
We're the good guys.
We're gonna help ya.

310
00:56:11,925 --> 00:56:14,694
You're lying.
They're lying!

311
00:56:15,862 --> 00:56:18,496
Mina, they're lying!
Don't listen to them!

312
00:56:18,498 --> 00:56:20,000
Who're you talking to,
Alex?

313
00:56:20,934 --> 00:56:23,003
Is Josef nearby, Alex?

314
00:56:24,838 --> 00:56:26,972
Is he here?

315
00:56:26,974 --> 00:56:28,876
Is he watching us right now?

316
00:56:30,978 --> 00:56:32,980
Come on out, Hofer!

317
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,851
Try, uh... picking on
someone your own size!

318
00:56:38,119 --> 00:56:40,688
Please, please,
don't do this.

319
00:56:40,788 --> 00:56:43,055
There are rules.

320
00:56:43,057 --> 00:56:44,690
He's going hurt them.

321
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,727
- Pop!
- Yeah, what?

322
00:56:48,095 --> 00:56:50,698
The girl who disappeared
when I was a kid...

323
00:56:52,099 --> 00:56:53,532
...the one that
lived in the house

324
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:55,103
that Nate got killed in...

325
00:56:56,271 --> 00:56:57,636
her name was Mina.

326
00:56:57,638 --> 00:56:59,005
Shut the hell up, Georgie!

327
00:56:59,007 --> 00:57:00,106
You're spooking the kid.

328
00:57:00,108 --> 00:57:02,675
Hang on Henry, just...
How could the kid know that?

329
00:57:02,677 --> 00:57:04,578
She's real.

330
00:57:05,013 --> 00:57:06,246
She's the monster

331
00:57:06,248 --> 00:57:08,649
and she's gonna
rip you to pieces!

332
00:57:09,851 --> 00:57:11,720
Do you have your cell,
Henry.

333
00:57:12,553 --> 00:57:13,922
Yeah.

334
00:57:15,824 --> 00:57:17,526
Call the Sheriff.

335
00:57:17,793 --> 00:57:19,759
Tell him we found the kid.

336
00:57:19,761 --> 00:57:21,027
Tell him better to get
his crew here quick...

337
00:57:34,177 --> 00:57:35,911
George, let's get her.

338
00:57:57,567 --> 00:57:59,102
Oh, shit.

339
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:01,871
<i>Help!</i>

340
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:04,805
<i>Somebody!</i>

341
00:58:04,807 --> 00:58:06,208
Please!

342
00:58:06,210 --> 00:58:08,078
Somebody help!

343
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:10,580
<i>I need help!</i>

344
00:58:12,349 --> 00:58:13,081
<i>Please!</i>

345
00:58:13,083 --> 00:58:14,782
Somebody help!

346
00:58:14,784 --> 00:58:16,719
Please don't!

347
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:27,998
<i>Shit.</i>

348
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:43,976
Are you gonna kill me now,
too?

349
00:59:58,291 --> 01:00:00,425
- That's what I thought.
- No.

350
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:02,863
I need you to dial.

351
01:00:09,102 --> 01:00:11,136
5-5-5...

352
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:16,643
7-4-5...

353
01:00:23,884 --> 01:00:28,655
5-6-8-7.

354
01:00:50,745 --> 01:00:52,079
<i>Hello?</i>

355
01:00:57,186 --> 01:00:58,886
<i>Hello?</i>

356
01:01:02,224 --> 01:01:03,992
<i>Hello?</i>

357
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,296
Hang it up.

358
01:01:10,265 --> 01:01:11,131
Hang it up!

359
01:01:11,133 --> 01:01:13,001
It is,
it's hang up.

360
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,242
Who was that?

361
01:01:23,212 --> 01:01:25,180
No signal.

362
01:01:29,818 --> 01:01:32,819
Well let's... try again.

363
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:34,723
Give me the number.

364
01:01:36,459 --> 01:01:38,794
Did Josef scream?

365
01:01:42,999 --> 01:01:45,235
Did he cry?

366
01:01:47,003 --> 01:01:50,840
Did he piss his pants?

367
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,913
I need to know.

368
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:02,819
He tried to run.
It was quick.

369
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,125
That's it?

370
01:02:09,360 --> 01:02:11,295
Yeah.

371
01:02:24,241 --> 01:02:26,410
How did it feel?

372
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:30,314
I don't know.

373
01:02:31,483 --> 01:02:33,485
Tell me.

374
01:02:41,959 --> 01:02:43,827
Like...

375
01:02:46,998 --> 01:02:50,035
Like, I just wanted him
to go away.

376
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:03,882
Yeah.

377
01:03:11,223 --> 01:03:13,992
You can leave if you want.

378
01:03:16,095 --> 01:03:20,032
Leave me, it's okay.

379
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:25,871
I won't tell anyone.

380
01:03:30,443 --> 01:03:32,378
I promise.

381
01:03:44,391 --> 01:03:46,393
Don't let go.

382
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,311
Wait here.

383
01:05:41,244 --> 01:05:43,812
<i>Please leave
a message after the tone.</i>

384
01:05:46,449 --> 01:05:48,184
<i>Mama?</i>

385
01:05:49,419 --> 01:05:50,754
<i>Mom, are you there?</i>

386
01:05:52,188 --> 01:05:55,258
<i>If you're there,
please pick up the phone.</i>

387
01:05:57,661 --> 01:05:59,160
<i>Me and Jeff are
still in the woods</i>

388
01:05:59,162 --> 01:06:00,796
<i>looking for the missing kid.</i>

389
01:06:00,798 --> 01:06:06,168
<i>I... I just wanted to call
and make sure you're okay</i>

390
01:06:06,170 --> 01:06:09,038
<i>with all this
craziness goin' on.</i>

391
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,476
<i>Maybe we can stop by later?</i>

392
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,544
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

393
01:06:15,546 --> 01:06:17,746
<i>Just... call me.</i>

394
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:19,515
<i>Okay?</i>

395
01:06:55,353 --> 01:06:58,356
A little late for
Halloween, isn't it?

396
01:07:07,433 --> 01:07:09,602
Looks good.

397
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:14,607
I would hate for my baby here
to make a mess of it.

398
01:07:16,809 --> 01:07:18,811
My friend,
he needs your phone.

399
01:07:19,545 --> 01:07:22,648
I hear they have
a phone at the morgue.

400
01:07:25,351 --> 01:07:26,853
I don't want to hurt you.

401
01:08:19,641 --> 01:08:22,175
It's burning my mouth
but I don't even care!

402
01:08:26,981 --> 01:08:28,916
You didn't have to do that.

403
01:08:32,820 --> 01:08:34,857
I was protecting you.

404
01:08:55,444 --> 01:08:56,712
There's a phone here.

405
01:09:07,423 --> 01:09:09,358
Is there any more soup?

406
01:09:54,437 --> 01:09:56,907
I was thinking, maybe...

407
01:10:05,716 --> 01:10:07,318
Never mind.

408
01:10:20,031 --> 01:10:22,000
Stay.

409
01:10:25,704 --> 01:10:29,440
Just... until they're gone.
Until it's safe.

410
01:10:34,513 --> 01:10:38,481
I mean, we have
this house now and...

411
01:10:38,483 --> 01:10:42,988
and there is food
and it's warm and...

412
01:16:03,418 --> 01:16:05,220
<i>Hello?</i>

413
01:16:07,755 --> 01:16:09,390
<i>Who is this?</i>

414
01:16:10,892 --> 01:16:12,758
<i>Look, I got a call
from this number earlier.</i>

415
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,195
<i>Why you keep...</i>

416
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,169
<i>It's you, isn't it?</i>

417
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,804
<i>Please...</i>

418
01:16:24,806 --> 01:16:27,209
<i>just... stop this.</i>

419
01:16:29,345 --> 01:16:31,113
<i>Please.</i>

420
01:16:31,913 --> 01:16:34,016
<i>Give me back my son!</i>

421
01:17:26,803 --> 01:17:28,004
Stop.

422
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:31,074
Stop...

423
01:17:58,102 --> 01:17:59,937
Hello? Hello.

424
01:18:01,405 --> 01:18:04,075
Okay, well put me though
the right person than.

425
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:10,347
Yes, I need to talk
to someone right now,

426
01:18:10,349 --> 01:18:12,049
it's an emergency!

427
01:18:12,150 --> 01:18:14,453
He's my boyfriend,
of course I...

428
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:19,024
Of course I trust him.

429
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,228
Why am I still on the phone?

430
01:18:25,497 --> 01:18:27,831
Why am I still
talking to you?!

431
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,235
Why aren't you out there
looking for my daughter?!

432
01:18:35,841 --> 01:18:37,376
Oh my...

433
01:18:40,413 --> 01:18:42,348
Mi... Mina?

434
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:48,954
Baby, who, who...
I mean, what...

435
01:18:52,425 --> 01:18:53,892
Mina?

436
01:18:54,893 --> 01:18:57,063
Please, look at me, baby.

437
01:18:59,866 --> 01:19:02,869
I'm... I'm sorry.

438
01:19:03,936 --> 01:19:06,205
I'm so, so sorry.

439
01:19:08,141 --> 01:19:10,174
Oh, my little girl...

440
01:19:44,011 --> 01:19:45,447
Mina?

441
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,613
Mina?

442
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:43,874
<i>I'm just gonna
check on Mom.</i>

443
01:20:50,112 --> 01:20:52,114
<i>Mina!</i>

444
01:21:47,572 --> 01:21:49,640
Alex, I'm fine.

445
01:22:19,338 --> 01:22:21,273
Alex!

446
01:22:48,234 --> 01:22:50,136
<i>Ma'am? Hello?</i>

447
01:22:56,776 --> 01:22:59,243
We're on Devil's Den Road...

448
01:22:59,245 --> 01:23:01,379
the one that cuts
through the woods.

449
01:23:01,381 --> 01:23:03,314
<i>Okay. We'll have someone
there any second to help you.</i>

450
01:23:03,316 --> 01:23:04,615
<i>Just hang tight.</i>

451
01:23:04,617 --> 01:23:06,386
Thank you.

452
01:23:09,757 --> 01:23:11,723
Help me move him.

453
01:23:11,725 --> 01:23:13,527
- I think it might make things worse.
- Mina?

454
01:23:15,128 --> 01:23:16,764
Mina, is that you?

455
01:23:17,230 --> 01:23:19,364
They said they'd
be here soon.

456
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:21,302
They'll know what to do.

457
01:23:24,371 --> 01:23:26,340
My husband?

458
01:23:33,647 --> 01:23:35,349
Alex...

459
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:38,751
It's okay, I'm here.

460
01:23:38,753 --> 01:23:40,920
Mina, Mina...

461
01:23:40,922 --> 01:23:44,425
It hurts, it hurts really,
really bad.

462
01:23:54,736 --> 01:23:57,172
I called the number, Alex.

463
01:24:02,711 --> 01:24:05,580
Your mom misses you so much.

464
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:13,586
You can go home.
It's okay.

465
01:24:13,588 --> 01:24:15,956
No.
He's gonna hurt them.

466
01:24:15,958 --> 01:24:18,826
No. No, Alex.
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

467
01:24:18,828 --> 01:24:21,462
You don't know Josef.

468
01:24:21,464 --> 01:24:24,798
Josef, he's gonna...
he's gonna hurt my family.

469
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:26,667
He's gonna find them
and he's, he's gonna...

470
01:24:26,669 --> 01:24:29,503
No, no, Alex.
It not what's going to happen.

471
01:24:29,505 --> 01:24:30,840
Please.

472
01:24:32,575 --> 01:24:36,577
He's gonna find my family.
He's, he's...

473
01:24:36,579 --> 01:24:39,215
He's gone.
He's gone.

474
01:24:41,817 --> 01:24:43,952
He can't hurt anyone.

475
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:45,889
I promise.

476
01:24:54,531 --> 01:24:57,299
I don't wanna to be
scared anymore.

477
01:25:01,538 --> 01:25:03,707
You don't have to be.

478
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:07,876
Please, I just...
I...

479
01:25:07,878 --> 01:25:10,747
I know. I know.
It's okay?

480
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,318
Me, too.

481
01:25:26,329 --> 01:25:29,801
When I was laying
on that bed...

482
01:25:30,868 --> 01:25:36,772
I was thinking about
when we... get back...

483
01:25:36,774 --> 01:25:40,912
that maybe I can
get my eyes fixed.

484
01:25:43,381 --> 01:25:45,750
Do you think maybe?

485
01:25:47,552 --> 01:25:49,787
Yeah, I think so.

486
01:26:00,733 --> 01:26:03,934
Alex? Alex!

487
01:26:03,936 --> 01:26:05,569
Alex, wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

488
01:26:23,555 --> 01:26:25,824
Mom? Mom?

489
01:26:26,525 --> 01:26:28,826
She's coming.
She's coming, Alex.

490
01:26:28,828 --> 01:26:30,094
Mina, where's my mom?

491
01:26:30,096 --> 01:26:32,464
I wanna,
I wanna see my mom.

492
01:26:36,836 --> 01:26:38,705
I'm not gonna let them
hurt you.

493
01:26:40,607 --> 01:26:43,610
I'm not gonna let anyone
hurt you ever again, okay?

494
01:26:46,479 --> 01:26:48,548
Let's go home.

495
01:26:50,083 --> 01:26:52,416
Let's go home, Mina.

496
01:27:16,010 --> 01:27:17,745
Let's go home.

497
01:27:21,615 --> 01:27:23,350
Mina!

498
01:27:25,486 --> 01:27:27,721
Mina!

499
01:27:32,526 --> 01:27:33,761

500
01:27:35,563 --> 01:27:36,932
Mina!

501
01:27:40,467 --> 01:27:43,370
Mina! Mina!

502
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:47,642
<i>Mina! Mina!</i>

503
01:30:46,126 --> 01:30:47,694
You okay there, hun?

504
01:30:49,896 --> 01:30:51,664
Are you lost?

505
01:30:52,199 --> 01:30:54,065
It's freezing out here.

506
01:30:54,067 --> 01:30:55,935
There's nothing
for miles around.

507
01:31:00,673 --> 01:31:02,975
I can give you
a lift somewhere.

508
01:31:02,977 --> 01:31:06,278
Bus station,
gas station... wherever.

509
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:07,882
It'd be no trouble.

510
01:31:09,817 --> 01:31:11,750
Please, hun,
get in the car.

511
01:31:11,752 --> 01:31:15,256
It's not safe out here
for a young girl like yourself.

512
01:31:22,897 --> 01:31:24,232
That-a-girl.

513
01:31:26,033 --> 01:31:28,836
Now, don't forget to
put on your seatbelt.

514
01:31:38,180 --> 01:31:40,714
You can never be to safe.

515
01:31:44,653 --> 01:31:46,321
So, where are you headed?

516
01:34:51,980 --> 01:34:56,980
