2
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:21,848
Uh...

3
00:01:36,228 --> 00:01:37,797
Oh, I have to finish
all this before...

4
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,934
Go and steam
the tablecloths for tonight.

5
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,337
I'm going to paint over that
water stain in the ceiling.

6
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,141
Huh!

7
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,783
Huh? Oh.

8
00:01:59,518 --> 00:02:00,753
Like, this afternoon?

9
00:02:00,786 --> 00:02:02,521
- Five minutes!
- What?

10
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,596
Which paint did you use?

11
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,173
Joy is here? Go set the table.
He must be hungry.

12
00:02:56,675 --> 00:02:58,611
We talk later?

13
00:03:25,938 --> 00:03:27,640
Hey, hey!

14
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:30,777
Thank you for doing this.

15
00:03:31,577 --> 00:03:33,379
You look really pretty
right now.

16
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:35,214
Oh, you like this...

17
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,083
...this hot Mormon look?

18
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,419
I'm just telling you now
in case my mom says

19
00:03:40,452 --> 00:03:44,090
something dumb
like you're fat or whatever.

20
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,491
I thought you said when she says

21
00:03:45,524 --> 00:03:47,260
shit like that,
it means she cares.

22
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,096
Hi, Evelyn.

23
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,430
- Mrs Wang!
- Hey, Mom.

24
00:03:51,463 --> 00:03:53,633
I only cook enough food
for three people.

25
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,568
Now I have to cook more.

26
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:01,174
It's Joy. She brought Becky.

27
00:04:10,182 --> 00:04:12,385
- Hi!
- Hi, honey!

28
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,520
Hi, Mr Wang!

29
00:04:14,553 --> 00:04:17,356
Hi, Becky!
Thank you for coming.

30
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:19,725
Please call me Waymond.
Here, sit.

31
00:04:19,758 --> 00:04:22,595
You know,
he doesn't have to stay.

32
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:23,929
Who's he?

33
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,398
- Becky.
- Becky's a she.

34
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,099
You know me.

35
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:28,668
I always mix up 'he', 'she'.

36
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,337
In Chinese,
just one word - 'ta' - so easy.

37
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,838
And the way you two are dressed,

38
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,740
I'm sure I'm not the only one
calling him 'he'.

39
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,609
I mean her 'him'. Ugh!

40
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:39,879
Anyways, my English is fine
and we have Google.

41
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:42,014
So you don't have to come
and be a translator.

42
00:04:42,047 --> 00:04:43,625
You stay here.

43
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,893
And she can go.

44
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,686
Look, I honestly
think it's weird, OK?

45
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,355
But Becky wants to help.
Right, Becky?

46
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:52,391
I always learn something when
I hang out with the elderly.

47
00:04:52,424 --> 00:04:54,393
Old people are very wise.

48
00:04:54,426 --> 00:04:55,828
Hmm. It's OK.

49
00:04:55,861 --> 00:04:57,863
We'll take Gong Gong
with us to the meeting.

50
00:04:57,896 --> 00:05:00,933
Uh, you and Becky stay here
and decorate. Hmm?

51
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,305
Where is he?
When can I meet him?

52
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,843
Huh! Customers.

53
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,345
Eat fast.

54
00:05:18,183 --> 00:05:19,552
- Mom.
- What?

55
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:20,886
Mom, just wait.

56
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:22,655
Wait? Wait?
No time to wait today.

57
00:05:22,688 --> 00:05:23,989
Just please...

58
00:05:24,022 --> 00:05:27,026
Joy, any other time,
I beg you to come and eat

59
00:05:27,059 --> 00:05:29,795
or call me or anything,
but today very busy.

60
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:31,506
Mom, this is literally
what it's always like.

61
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,832
Wrong white paint!

62
00:05:32,865 --> 00:05:34,743
I know you haven't always
liked Becky, OK, but...

63
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,103
I like Becky. She is very nice.

64
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:39,372
You are very lucky...

65
00:05:44,576 --> 00:05:46,245
She's half Mexican.

66
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,649
Ugh!

67
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,152
- Huh!
- No shoes in washer.

68
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:54,920
Broken, you pay, yeah?

69
00:05:54,953 --> 00:05:58,457
But Gong Gong,
his heart cannot take it,

70
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,892
especially after
such a long flight.

71
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:02,595
You want him to come all the way
from China to die like that?

72
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,497
He's not gonna die.

73
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:05,598
Ooh!

74
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:08,734
- How can I help you?
- Just hold on. I can't hear you.

75
00:06:08,767 --> 00:06:10,403
- Just hold on.
- How can I help you?

76
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,737
I'm here to pick up some shirts.

77
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,515
- I called, like, three times.
- Give me your ticket.

78
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,649
- Mmm-hmm, yeah.
- I find for you.

79
00:06:14,673 --> 00:06:16,017
- No, I have the ticket.
- Babe...

80
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,652
She's just asking
for it 'cause that's, like,

81
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:18,844
the way that it works.

82
00:06:18,877 --> 00:06:20,146
They don't read minds.

83
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,149
Then hang up! Thank you.

84
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:24,917
We've been together
for three years.

85
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,353
Don't you think Gong Gong
would want to know?

86
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,721
Let him enjoy his party tonight.

87
00:06:28,754 --> 00:06:30,698
Yeah, you think
Becky's gonna get through

88
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,267
the whole party without
introducing herself...

89
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,360
- Evelyn!
- Have you met Becky?

90
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:37,697
Guess whose $20 got eaten
by the machine again.

91
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:40,733
Waymond! Customers need you!

92
00:06:40,766 --> 00:06:42,134
Alright, coming!

93
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,770
Evelyn, you know,
my wife used to wear

94
00:06:44,803 --> 00:06:47,072
that exact same perfume,
God rest her soul.

95
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:48,841
Are you coming
to the party tonight?

96
00:06:48,874 --> 00:06:51,043
Yeah, I got my ticket
right here.

97
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:57,616
Sorry. It was too crowded here
so I moved some upstairs.

98
00:06:57,649 --> 00:06:59,452
I think the clothes
are happier there.

99
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,761
See? They're happier here.

100
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:16,969
No more Google eyes!

101
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,238
Mom, can we please
talk about Becky?

102
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,783
I still don't know
what his brain is thinking.

103
00:07:21,807 --> 00:07:24,009
Can Becky
come tonight or not?

104
00:07:24,042 --> 00:07:25,578
- Stop changing the subject.
- I'm not.

105
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,213
You know, it's like our auditor.

106
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,981
She is a terrible person.

107
00:07:29,014 --> 00:07:32,018
She keeps targeting
the Chinese in the community.

108
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,454
You know, two years of meetings,

109
00:07:35,487 --> 00:07:37,456
she puts a lien
on our laundromat.

110
00:07:37,489 --> 00:07:38,891
And you know
what your father does?

111
00:07:38,924 --> 00:07:40,759
He brings her cookies.

112
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:45,898
Every day I fight, I fight.

113
00:07:45,931 --> 00:07:47,933
I fight for all of us.

114
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:51,203
Every day is a battle here.

115
00:07:51,236 --> 00:07:55,975
Oh, your father, he doesn't care
about the way things are...

116
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,081
I try to make our lives
easier and more simple.

117
00:08:12,057 --> 00:08:13,401
You should
have told me earlier.

118
00:08:13,425 --> 00:08:15,036
That's really impressive.

119
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,829
Evelyn, you have
to see Rick dance.

120
00:08:16,862 --> 00:08:19,231
Look, he knows all of the moves.

121
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:22,701
Becky,
I'll fucking kill myself.

122
00:08:24,169 --> 00:08:26,038
He wants to be an actor,
just like you did.

123
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:33,379
♪ Just put your hand

124
00:08:36,615 --> 00:08:41,720
♪ And we'll spin
through eternity

125
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:44,823
♪ Life can be so delicious

126
00:08:50,462 --> 00:08:54,233
Ah! I love this!

127
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,035
- Hey!
- Rick, you're so terrific.

128
00:08:56,935 --> 00:08:58,170
I know. I just...

129
00:08:58,203 --> 00:09:00,081
I just don't know how to be
any fucking clearer.

130
00:09:00,105 --> 00:09:01,173
It's like she can choose -

131
00:09:01,206 --> 00:09:02,775
either you come
to the party with me

132
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:04,209
and Gong Gong
is eternally ashamed

133
00:09:04,242 --> 00:09:06,011
until he forgets it all
and then he dies

134
00:09:06,044 --> 00:09:08,414
or you don't come with me
and then he still dies.

135
00:09:08,447 --> 00:09:10,383
What? Huh!

136
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:13,752
- What are you saying?
- That was a joke.

137
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,889
Uh, that's not
a very funny joke, honey.

138
00:09:16,922 --> 00:09:18,357
- Hey, guys...
- This is only $10.

139
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:20,259
I thought you people
were very good with math.

140
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:21,869
- Next time I give you interest.
- Evelyn?

141
00:09:21,893 --> 00:09:23,037
Mom, Mom...

142
00:09:23,061 --> 00:09:25,264
- Mom! Mom!
- What?!

143
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,466
Huh!

144
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,008
Waymond! Waymond!

145
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,480
Huh?

146
00:09:42,447 --> 00:09:44,083
Oh!

147
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:46,419
Uh...

148
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:53,059
Uh...

149
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,361
Uh...

150
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:06,472
Shit, how do you say it? Uh...

151
00:10:07,739 --> 00:10:09,075
Oh!

152
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,178
Mom...

153
00:10:14,913 --> 00:10:16,982
You know what?
I'm actually not doing that.

154
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,919
It's like
at this point I do not...

155
00:10:24,756 --> 00:10:26,392
It was nice to meet you!

156
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,331
Hi!
Give us five-star cleaning.

157
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:33,841
Also...

158
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:35,868
There is a Chinese
New Year party tonight,

159
00:10:35,901 --> 00:10:37,770
open to all the customers
in the community.

160
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,871
Thank you.

161
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,639
- Please come and enjoy...
- This is fine.

162
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:41,712
- ...the good food...
- OK.

163
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,142
- ...and nice music, OK?
- Alright.

164
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:45,144
I get you an invite.
Moment... moment, please.

165
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,546
- Can you hear this right now?
- Joy, wait! Please!

166
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,248
I have something to say to you!

167
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:50,950
What?

168
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:00,559
You...

169
00:11:01,426 --> 00:11:03,562
...you have to try
and eat healthier.

170
00:11:04,896 --> 00:11:06,666
You are getting fat.

171
00:11:56,114 --> 00:11:57,816
Evelyn?

172
00:12:00,552 --> 00:12:01,654
Evelyn?

173
00:12:26,144 --> 00:12:27,813
Go, go, go, go!

174
00:12:27,846 --> 00:12:29,081
OK!

175
00:13:11,556 --> 00:13:13,659
If I have to think
of one more thing today,

176
00:13:13,692 --> 00:13:15,828
my head will explode.

177
00:13:29,241 --> 00:13:31,109
You may be in grave danger.

178
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:33,746
There's no time to explain.
Hold this.

179
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:37,616
Why are you doing this?

180
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:38,717
Pay attention.

181
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:41,220
When we leave this elevator,
you can either turn left

182
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,597
towards your scheduled
audit appointment

183
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,192
or you can turn right and go
into the janitor's closet.

184
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,294
Why would I go
into the janitor's...

185
00:13:49,327 --> 00:13:50,529
Not now.

186
00:13:54,065 --> 00:13:56,535
Why you download
all these apps on my phone?

187
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,705
Breathe in.

188
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,841
You're gonna feel a slight
pressure in your head.

189
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,643
Huh!

190
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,169
Hey, baby Joy!

191
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:06,080
You come back here!

192
00:15:06,104 --> 00:15:07,339
Shut up!

193
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:09,207
You don't talk
to your mother like this!

194
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,177
I'll talk to her
how I fucking want!

195
00:15:16,014 --> 00:15:18,283
Activation...

196
00:15:21,219 --> 00:15:22,988
The moment you're
situated in your meeting,

197
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:24,623
follow these instructions.

198
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:27,893
But, remember, no-one can know.

199
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:29,261
Don't even talk to me about this

200
00:15:29,294 --> 00:15:30,862
because I won't remember.

201
00:15:30,895 --> 00:15:32,564
- But I...
- Shh.

202
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:37,569
Mental scan complete.

203
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,279
Talk to you soon.

204
00:16:13,671 --> 00:16:15,307
Hello!

205
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:21,246
Mrs Wang?

206
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:23,649
Mrs Wang?

207
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,652
Mrs Wang, are you with us?

208
00:16:28,086 --> 00:16:29,588
Yes.

209
00:16:30,388 --> 00:16:31,857
Of course. I am here.

210
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,458
- Just thinking.
- Oh, OK.

211
00:16:33,491 --> 00:16:36,495
Well, I was just hoping...

212
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,598
...that you could explain this.

213
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:46,271
This is a receipt.

214
00:16:47,305 --> 00:16:48,841
My receipt.

215
00:16:53,211 --> 00:16:54,446
Look, I...

216
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:57,549
...I was just hoping
you could enlighten me

217
00:16:57,582 --> 00:17:00,719
as to how,
as a laundromat owner,

218
00:17:00,752 --> 00:17:02,587
a karaoke machine

219
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,823
could constitute
a business expense?

220
00:17:04,856 --> 00:17:06,691
I am a singer.

221
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,662
- Of course you are.
- It's true.

222
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:12,964
She has a beautiful voice. Oh!

223
00:17:12,997 --> 00:17:14,966
Evelyn, sing a song for her.

224
00:17:14,999 --> 00:17:16,902
- Shh!
- No, no, please.

225
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:18,470
That will not be necessary.

226
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:21,406
But I will need
a separate Schedule C

227
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,609
for each of these businesses

228
00:17:24,642 --> 00:17:27,512
because based on what
you're trying to deduct,

229
00:17:27,545 --> 00:17:30,949
you're also a novelist
and a chef.

230
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:32,851
Last time, you told me that...

231
00:17:32,884 --> 00:17:34,853
Please.

232
00:17:34,886 --> 00:17:36,221
...a teacher,

233
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:39,558
uh, and a singing coach

234
00:17:39,591 --> 00:17:42,260
and a 'Watsu' technician.

235
00:17:42,293 --> 00:17:45,531
I'm sorry.
What... what is 'Watsu'?

236
00:17:46,364 --> 00:17:48,100
It's a water massage.

237
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,836
What's a water massage?

238
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:53,004
Like...
like for back pain.

239
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:54,473
You go get a water massage.

240
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:56,074
- Oh, you go?
- Yes.

241
00:18:51,729 --> 00:18:53,165
What's happening?

242
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,701
...like I'm talking
to my ex-husband.

243
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,538
Like I said to you before,
co-mingling of your...

244
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,606
- It's you messing with my head.
- Shh!

245
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,642
- Don't shh me!
- You got to relax your body.

246
00:19:03,675 --> 00:19:05,577
Don't...

247
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,620
Calm down, please!

248
00:19:06,644 --> 00:19:08,446
Calm down.

249
00:19:08,479 --> 00:19:11,049
Relax your body
in the other universe. Please.

250
00:19:12,483 --> 00:19:13,527
..these deductions...

251
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:15,053
Go into auto-pilot.

252
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:17,889
You can't then
deduct it if it's an off...

253
00:19:17,922 --> 00:19:20,725
Good. Good.

254
00:19:20,758 --> 00:19:23,361
They don't know you and I
are in this universe yet

255
00:19:23,394 --> 00:19:25,463
so, hopefully, I'll have
some time to explain.

256
00:19:25,496 --> 00:19:28,166
I am not your husband.
At least not the one you know.

257
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:29,467
I am another version of him

258
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,336
from another life path,
another universe.

259
00:19:31,369 --> 00:19:34,173
I'm here because
we need your help.

260
00:19:35,206 --> 00:19:37,676
Very busy today.
No time to help you.

261
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:38,844
Shh!

262
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,479
There is a great evil
that has taken root in my world

263
00:19:41,512 --> 00:19:43,014
and has begun
spreading its chaos

264
00:19:43,047 --> 00:19:44,124
throughout the many verses.

265
00:19:44,148 --> 00:19:45,750
I have spent years searching

266
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,519
for the one who might
be able to match

267
00:19:47,552 --> 00:19:49,721
this great evil
with an even greater good

268
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,256
and bring back balance.

269
00:19:51,289 --> 00:19:53,692
All those years of searching
have brought me here...

270
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:56,027
- Mrs Wang?
- ..to this universe.

271
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,961
- Hello?!
- To you.

272
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:58,964
I know it's a lot
to take in right now...

273
00:19:58,997 --> 00:19:59,965
Mrs Wang?!

274
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,567
Hello?

275
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,769
Look, I'm sure you have
a lot on your mind,

276
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:08,873
but I cannot imagine
anything mattering more

277
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:11,776
than the conversation
we are now having

278
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:14,279
concerning your tax liability.

279
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:16,281
Uh, need I remind you
that there is

280
00:20:16,314 --> 00:20:17,882
already a lien on your property?

281
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,851
Repossession is well
within our rights.

282
00:20:19,884 --> 00:20:23,055
I know. I am paying attention.

283
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:29,595
Do you see these?

284
00:20:31,663 --> 00:20:33,865
You don't get one of these

285
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:36,001
unless you've seen
a lot of bullshit.

286
00:20:36,034 --> 00:20:37,603
Excuse my French.

287
00:20:38,369 --> 00:20:39,738
Now you may...

288
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:42,907
...only see a pile of
boring forms and numbers,

289
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,810
but I see a story.

290
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:49,080
With nothing
but a stack of receipts,

291
00:20:49,113 --> 00:20:53,085
I can trace the ups and downs
of your lives.

292
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,655
And it does not look good.

293
00:20:57,622 --> 00:21:01,626
It does not look good.

294
00:21:01,659 --> 00:21:03,995
- But...
- Uh...

295
00:21:04,028 --> 00:21:08,500
Sorry, my wife confuses
her hobbies for businesses.

296
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:10,569
An honest mistake.

297
00:21:11,336 --> 00:21:13,572
Oh! OK.

298
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,242
Well, with all of these, um...

299
00:21:18,509 --> 00:21:19,911
..."honest mistakes,"

300
00:21:19,944 --> 00:21:23,048
I mean, even if we don't
charge you with fraud,

301
00:21:23,081 --> 00:21:25,583
we'll most certainly
have to fine you

302
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,586
for gross negligence.

303
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:30,588
You're always
trying to confuse us

304
00:21:30,621 --> 00:21:33,025
with these big words.

305
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,428
I thought
you were going to bring

306
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:40,332
your daughter
to help you translate.

307
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:42,676
- I am going to bring my...
- Hey!

308
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,278
- Sorry.
- Evelyn?

309
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,403
She was going to come...

310
00:21:45,436 --> 00:21:47,205
Evelyn!
Are you paying attention?

311
00:21:47,238 --> 00:21:48,373
I cannot talk now.

312
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:49,883
She's too busy
to help her parents?

313
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:51,509
Unless you can help me
with my taxes.

314
00:21:51,542 --> 00:21:53,845
What is "gross necklaces"?

315
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:55,947
I know you have a lot
of things on your mind,

316
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,716
but nothing could
possibly matter more

317
00:21:57,749 --> 00:21:59,351
than this conversation
we are having

318
00:21:59,384 --> 00:22:00,785
right now concerning the fate

319
00:22:00,818 --> 00:22:03,488
of every single world
of our infinite multiverse.

320
00:22:03,521 --> 00:22:06,291
Where's the respect
for elders?

321
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:10,061
My dear Evelyn,

322
00:22:10,094 --> 00:22:11,463
I know you.

323
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:13,198
With every passing moment,

324
00:22:13,231 --> 00:22:15,033
you fear you might have
missed your chance

325
00:22:15,066 --> 00:22:17,502
to make something of your life.

326
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:19,270
I'm here to tell you

327
00:22:19,303 --> 00:22:20,905
every rejection,

328
00:22:20,938 --> 00:22:24,309
every disappointment
has led you here

329
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:26,178
to this moment.

330
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,715
Don't let anything
distract you from it.

331
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:38,824
Do you think this is funny?

332
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,029
So what will it be?

333
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,698
I'm thinking.

334
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,770
Our time here is up.

335
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:53,471
- They're going to kill us.
- What?

336
00:22:53,504 --> 00:22:57,075
You think you can give us more
time so we can redo all this?

337
00:22:57,108 --> 00:22:59,077
Do not worry,
this is just a burner universe

338
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,612
we are using for communication.

339
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,147
Oh-oh-oh!

340
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,948
You will know when
it is time to fight.

341
00:23:03,981 --> 00:23:06,684
You want to redo?
You're going to resubmit?

342
00:23:06,717 --> 00:23:08,686
- I will be in contact soon.
- Shh, shh, shh.

343
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,989
I think my other husband
is messing up the audit.

344
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:14,826
Maybe we can look at
all the receipts again and...

345
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:18,196
Evelyn! Trust no-one. Oh!

346
00:23:29,974 --> 00:23:32,577
Oh, no, no. No, no, no. No...!

347
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,453
Oh, dear lord.

348
00:23:43,821 --> 00:23:46,357
OK. Everything OK.

349
00:23:47,758 --> 00:23:49,427
I think I forget
something at home.

350
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,763
Uh, sit down.

351
00:23:57,134 --> 00:23:59,738
I think I'm going
to regret this.

352
00:24:10,581 --> 00:24:12,117
You can go.

353
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:16,221
What?

354
00:24:18,923 --> 00:24:21,726
You... you will have...

355
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:24,762
You will have until
I leave the office tonight

356
00:24:24,795 --> 00:24:27,399
to bring everything in,
6:00 p.m.

357
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:29,868
Last chance.

358
00:24:29,901 --> 00:24:32,337
- Oh, tomorrow is better...
- Thank you! Thank you!

359
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,805
Thank you. 6:00 p.m.

360
00:24:33,838 --> 00:24:36,541
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you for the cookies.

361
00:24:36,574 --> 00:24:38,944
They look delicious.

362
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:43,948
Last chance!

363
00:24:43,981 --> 00:24:45,383
Have a nice day.

364
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:47,919
Last chance.

365
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,402
Oh, no.

366
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:07,105
Evelyn! Evelyn!

367
00:25:17,014 --> 00:25:19,017
So you know about this?

368
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:29,494
It was you. Like,
you who was in the elevator.

369
00:25:32,863 --> 00:25:34,499
I was in the elevator.

370
00:25:34,532 --> 00:25:35,934
Come back next week.

371
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:49,881
I'm not ready to fight.

372
00:25:51,449 --> 00:25:53,484
I am not ready to fight.

373
00:25:53,517 --> 00:25:54,819
Maybe we don't have a choice.

374
00:25:54,852 --> 00:25:56,054
What?

375
00:26:13,938 --> 00:26:16,107
Switch shoes to what?

376
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,476
- Ow! Oh!
- Evelyn?!

377
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:19,711
Someone call security!

378
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,312
What are you doing?

379
00:26:21,345 --> 00:26:22,580
You told me to do it!

380
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:26,050
You said I would know
when it is the time to fight!

381
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,652
She was coming after us.

382
00:26:27,685 --> 00:26:29,988
Oh!

383
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:33,558
Oh, you have no idea, lady. Oh!

384
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:36,227
Assaulting an IRS agent?

385
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:39,464
You have no idea!

386
00:26:44,635 --> 00:26:47,372
"Dissolution of marriage"?

387
00:26:48,973 --> 00:26:50,708
Yes, I'm on the tenth floor.

388
00:26:50,741 --> 00:26:52,544
No...

389
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,658
Your brother gets a divorce,

390
00:27:06,691 --> 00:27:09,460
now you think divorce is OK?

391
00:27:09,493 --> 00:27:11,329
I don't think it's OK!

392
00:27:13,531 --> 00:27:15,667
We made a sacred promise.

393
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:24,209
I told you to stay low
and out of sight.

394
00:27:25,576 --> 00:27:28,346
Oh, now you're here?

395
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:31,249
Huh! Stop confusing me,
coming and going.

396
00:27:31,282 --> 00:27:32,426
- Stop it, stop it, stop...
- Relax.

397
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:34,027
I'll get you out of this.

398
00:27:34,051 --> 00:27:35,353
Stop coming here.

399
00:27:35,386 --> 00:27:38,556
OK, folks.
Everyone remain calm.

400
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:40,091
Oh, thank... thank God!

401
00:27:40,124 --> 00:27:42,694
It's that one right there.
The Chinese lady!

402
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:43,928
No! It's all his fault!

403
00:27:43,961 --> 00:27:45,105
Right there,
she assaulted me!

404
00:27:45,129 --> 00:27:47,031
OK, I need you two
to get on the ground

405
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,499
with your hands
behind your heads.

406
00:27:48,532 --> 00:27:50,035
OK, OK, OK.

407
00:27:57,441 --> 00:27:58,910
Sir, please comply.

408
00:28:21,465 --> 00:28:24,302
OK, whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't do it.

409
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,183
Sir?

410
00:28:58,502 --> 00:29:00,004
It's OK.

411
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:03,541
OK, sir. That's enough.

412
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:19,290
Oh!

413
00:29:42,379 --> 00:29:43,715
Holy shit.

414
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:52,190
Hyah!

415
00:30:00,764 --> 00:30:03,134
Oh!

416
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,229
Hey.

417
00:30:41,939 --> 00:30:43,842
Oh, no, Craig! Fuck.

418
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,185
Arggh!

419
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,765
On your feet.

420
00:31:07,798 --> 00:31:10,668
Who... What is happening?

421
00:31:12,636 --> 00:31:14,381
I'm not the Waymond
who wants to divorce you.

422
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:16,040
I'm the Waymond
who is saving your life.

423
00:31:16,073 --> 00:31:17,350
Now, you can either come with me

424
00:31:17,374 --> 00:31:19,043
and live up to
your ultimate potential

425
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,778
or lie here and live
with the consequences.

426
00:31:20,811 --> 00:31:22,347
I want to lie here.

427
00:31:23,113 --> 00:31:25,283
Hey, hey, hey.

428
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:26,984
No, no! Put me down! No, no!

429
00:31:40,097 --> 00:31:46,037
Citizens of
the 4,655th Thetaverse,

430
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,639
you are about to be graced

431
00:31:48,672 --> 00:31:52,710
by the presence
of our sovereign leader,

432
00:31:52,743 --> 00:31:54,312
Jobu Tupaki.

433
00:31:56,313 --> 00:31:59,116
Now let me assure you
of one thing.

434
00:31:59,149 --> 00:32:01,619
Just like the rest
of your miserable lives,

435
00:32:01,652 --> 00:32:03,321
this is nothing more

436
00:32:03,354 --> 00:32:06,557
than a statistical
inevitability.

437
00:32:09,259 --> 00:32:11,062
Duck.

438
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,864
Duck.

439
00:32:14,465 --> 00:32:15,333
Duck...

440
00:32:15,366 --> 00:32:16,534
Jobu Tupaki

441
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:19,837
has seen all and knows all.

442
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,173
She knows what makes you tick,

443
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:27,412
on what fragile branches
your self-worth rests.

444
00:32:28,345 --> 00:32:31,115
This one.

445
00:32:42,593 --> 00:32:43,527
Hang on.

446
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,397
Don't die yet, alright, buddy?

447
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:49,968
Ugh.

448
00:33:01,979 --> 00:33:03,347
It's not her.

449
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,958
...police are
looking for all information.

450
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:06,250
This is a developing story.

451
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,827
- What we do know...
- They might be close.

452
00:33:07,851 --> 00:33:10,154
We do have unconfirmed
photos of the suspects.

453
00:33:11,255 --> 00:33:12,390
An unidentified man

454
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:13,858
went berserk
at the regional office

455
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,494
for the Internal Revenue Service
in Simi Valley this morning.

456
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:17,971
Police aren't releasing
any information...

457
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:20,498
- Is that where your parents are?
- This is a developing story.

458
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:22,375
- But we do have unconfirmed...
- Are you OK?

459
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:23,501
...photos of the suspects.

460
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:25,078
- If you recognise them...
- Hey!

461
00:33:25,102 --> 00:33:28,005
- Are you OK?
- ..help identify them.

462
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,540
Joy?

463
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,711
If you recognise these two,

464
00:33:33,744 --> 00:33:36,080
police are seeking help
identifying the assailants.

465
00:33:44,321 --> 00:33:46,390
My husband won't
even kill a spider.

466
00:33:46,423 --> 00:33:48,125
How can you be the same person?

467
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:49,936
You underestimate
how the smallest decisions

468
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,963
can compound into significant
differences over a lifetime.

469
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:54,532
Every tiny decision creates

470
00:33:54,565 --> 00:33:56,700
another branching
universe, another...

471
00:33:56,733 --> 00:33:58,569
Were you not paying
attention before?

472
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,905
Of course. You're just
very bad at explaining...

473
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:02,340
Shh!

474
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:08,079
Don't push me!

475
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:12,316
Oh, my God!
We have to go back.

476
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:13,517
We forgot my father!

477
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,187
Don't worry. We're
monitoring him. He's safe.

478
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,497
- I don't know. Are you sure?
- Yes.

479
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:21,592
Hey, look, come on!

480
00:34:21,625 --> 00:34:23,561
Look, this is your universe,

481
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:26,831
one bubble floating in
the cosmic foam of existence.

482
00:34:26,864 --> 00:34:29,667
Every surrounding bubble
has slight variations.

483
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,936
But the further away
you get from your universe,

484
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,571
the bigger the differences.

485
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:37,208
This is where I am from,
The Alpha verse.

486
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:40,411
The first universe to make
contact with the others.

487
00:34:40,444 --> 00:34:42,580
You can call me Alpha Waymond.

488
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:47,485
In this world,

489
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,354
you were a brilliant woman.

490
00:34:50,387 --> 00:34:51,922
In your search to prove

491
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:53,557
the existence
of other universes,

492
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,793
you discovered a way
to temporarily link

493
00:34:55,826 --> 00:34:58,696
your consciousness to another
version of yourself,

494
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,231
accessing all of their memories,

495
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:03,200
their skills,
even their emotions.

496
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:06,670
Like you with the fanny pack?

497
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:09,807
Exactly.
It's called Verse Jumping.

498
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,875
"Verse Jumping."

499
00:35:10,908 --> 00:35:13,244
I need you to learn
how to do it right now.

500
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,979
Right now?!

501
00:35:15,779 --> 00:35:18,616
It may be our only chance
of getting out of here alive.

502
00:35:29,226 --> 00:35:30,761
Two guards coming this way.

503
00:35:30,794 --> 00:35:32,930
On my signal, try to blend in.

504
00:35:34,731 --> 00:35:37,735
Why don't you get
your Evelyn to do this?

505
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,337
My Evelyn is dead.

506
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,039
Go! Oh, my God!

507
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:43,340
Oh, my God, what is going on?

508
00:35:43,373 --> 00:35:45,109
Help us! Help us!

509
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:55,753
How did I die?

510
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:57,955
I've seen you die
a thousand ways,

511
00:35:57,988 --> 00:35:59,757
in a thousand worlds.

512
00:36:00,524 --> 00:36:03,427
In every single one,
you were murdered.

513
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,596
What? Why would anybody
want to kill me?

514
00:36:05,629 --> 00:36:08,432
She's an omniversal being
with unimaginable power,

515
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:10,134
an agent of pure chaos,

516
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:12,170
with no real motives or desires.

517
00:36:12,936 --> 00:36:15,539
- Jobu Tupaki.
- You're just making up sounds.

518
00:36:15,572 --> 00:36:17,608
Shh!

519
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,879
We need another exit.

520
00:36:23,513 --> 00:36:25,349
So let her destroy
the other bubbles.

521
00:36:25,382 --> 00:36:26,817
You said there are
so many of them.

522
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,086
Maybe it's OK
if we lose some,

523
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,189
but just leave me out of it.

524
00:36:33,557 --> 00:36:35,893
It's not so simple.

525
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,698
She's been building something.

526
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:44,335
We thought it was
some sort of black hole.

527
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,536
But it appears to consume

528
00:36:45,569 --> 00:36:47,638
more than just light and matter.

529
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:49,840
We don't know exactly
what it is.

530
00:36:49,873 --> 00:36:52,142
We don't know what it's for.

531
00:36:52,175 --> 00:36:54,245
But we can all

532
00:36:54,278 --> 00:36:55,579
feel it.

533
00:36:55,612 --> 00:36:58,382
You've been feeling it too,
haven't you?

534
00:36:58,415 --> 00:36:59,984
Something is off.

535
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:03,020
Your clothes never wear
as well the next day.

536
00:37:03,053 --> 00:37:06,023
Your hair never falls
in quite the same way.

537
00:37:06,056 --> 00:37:08,226
Even your coffee tastes...

538
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,828
...wrong.

539
00:37:11,728 --> 00:37:14,265
Our institutions are crumbling.

540
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:17,067
Nobody trusts
their neighbour anymore.

541
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,470
And you stay up at night
wondering to yourself...

542
00:37:19,503 --> 00:37:21,839
How can we get back?

543
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:27,011
This is
the Alphaverse's mission -

544
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:29,913
to take us back
to how it's supposed to be.

545
00:37:29,946 --> 00:37:32,283
But that begins
with finding the one

546
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:36,087
who can stand up to Jobu's
perverse shroud of chaos.

547
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,990
And you think it's me?

548
00:37:39,756 --> 00:37:41,158
Why else would
we risk everything

549
00:37:41,191 --> 00:37:42,893
to get you out of here?

550
00:37:52,502 --> 00:37:55,439
Oh, there you are.

551
00:37:55,472 --> 00:37:57,775
Oh, Miss Deirdre!

552
00:37:57,808 --> 00:38:00,311
I'm sorry I punched you, but...

553
00:38:00,344 --> 00:38:01,879
Look.

554
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:04,348
I think I finally
understand why...

555
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,585
What is she doing?

556
00:38:08,618 --> 00:38:10,421
Verse Jumping. Run!

557
00:38:19,663 --> 00:38:20,898
- Come on.
- Oh!

558
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,267
Go! Go! Go!

559
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:30,107
She jumped somewhere.
Brute force.

560
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,275
The sumo wrestler?

561
00:38:31,308 --> 00:38:32,609
- Body builder?
- Doesn't matter.

562
00:38:32,642 --> 00:38:34,078
Counter with someone agile.

563
00:38:34,111 --> 00:38:36,814
On your perimeter, we've got
a break dancer, mime...

564
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:38,415
- A gymnast.
- Give me gymnast!

565
00:38:38,448 --> 00:38:39,683
- Go!
- Calculating route.

566
00:38:42,252 --> 00:38:44,230
OK,
some paper cuts, four of them.

567
00:38:44,254 --> 00:38:45,690
One between each finger.

568
00:38:49,059 --> 00:38:51,228
Paper cuts only happen
when you aren't trying.

569
00:38:51,261 --> 00:38:52,396
It's impossible.

570
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:54,531
Probability - 1 in 8,000.

571
00:38:54,564 --> 00:38:57,234
It's the strongest
jumping pad we have.

572
00:38:59,002 --> 00:39:01,205
- What are you doing?
- Come on, come on.

573
00:39:08,211 --> 00:39:09,980
There we go, one.

574
00:39:11,181 --> 00:39:13,351
- There's two.
- Ooh.

575
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:16,854
- Ugh!
- Three.

576
00:39:16,887 --> 00:39:19,623
Alright, come on, come on,
come on. Stick with me.

577
00:39:21,057 --> 00:39:22,326
Come on.

578
00:39:30,033 --> 00:39:31,377
Four! There it is.

579
00:39:31,401 --> 00:39:33,370
OK, come on, jump!

580
00:39:41,445 --> 00:39:42,713
Huh!

581
00:39:42,746 --> 00:39:44,782
Is that pro wrestling?

582
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,692
She's going for a back breaker!

583
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,458
- She's gotta run.
- No.

584
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,584
She can jump,
somewhere she can fight.

585
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:21,861
She's not ready.

586
00:40:21,885 --> 00:40:24,121
A jump like that would fry
most people.

587
00:40:24,888 --> 00:40:26,857
She's not most people.

588
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,230
Damn, what a weak body.

589
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:43,373
- Hello?
- Evelyn!

590
00:40:43,406 --> 00:40:44,808
Can you hear me?

591
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:46,543
You're going to have
to Verse Jump.

592
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:48,179
Verse Jump?

593
00:40:58,989 --> 00:41:00,257
Hello?

594
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:01,492
Concentrate on a universe

595
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:03,427
in which you studied
martial arts.

596
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,003
OK, I'm locking in.

597
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:15,806
Calculations complete.

598
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:17,608
"Profess your love."

599
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:21,287
You're gonna have
to profess your love to Deirdre.

600
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:24,047
- No way.
- It's your jumping pad.

601
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,350
It's like eating the chap stick
or switching shoes.

602
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,752
We developed an algorithm
that calculates

603
00:41:28,785 --> 00:41:30,129
which statistically
improbable action

604
00:41:30,153 --> 00:41:31,889
will place you in a universe

605
00:41:31,922 --> 00:41:33,457
on the edge
of your local cluster,

606
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:36,226
which then sling shots you
to the desired universe.

607
00:41:37,861 --> 00:41:39,530
That doesn't make any sense!

608
00:41:39,563 --> 00:41:41,131
Exactly.

609
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:43,400
The less sense it makes,
the better.

610
00:41:43,433 --> 00:41:46,603
The Stochastic Path Algorithm
is fuel led by random actions.

611
00:41:46,636 --> 00:41:48,939
Tell her you love her
and mean it.

612
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:51,675
Are there any
other jumping pads?

613
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:56,013
The next best paths are break
your own arm or take a nap.

614
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,714
You're not sleepy, are you?

615
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:03,120
I love you.

616
00:42:03,153 --> 00:42:04,922
Jumping pad failure.

617
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:07,391
Evelyn, wait! No!

618
00:42:15,131 --> 00:42:16,533
No.

619
00:42:16,566 --> 00:42:18,411
She's in
a local divergent universe.

620
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:19,970
No, no, no.

621
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,906
She's gone home...

622
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:24,541
...to finish the taxes.

623
00:42:28,011 --> 00:42:29,446
Ah!

624
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,765
This doesn't make any sense.

625
00:42:48,798 --> 00:42:50,534
Think about it.

626
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:55,439
...you always get pulled away.

627
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,581
Waymond!

628
00:43:04,614 --> 00:43:06,984
Waymond!

629
00:43:09,152 --> 00:43:10,921
I'm sorry, Evelyn.

630
00:43:10,954 --> 00:43:12,589
- Huh?
- I need to go.

631
00:43:12,622 --> 00:43:13,824
What?

632
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,759
I need
to find the right Evelyn.

633
00:43:15,792 --> 00:43:17,861
And this one,

634
00:43:17,894 --> 00:43:19,696
it's not the one.

635
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:22,232
No! No.
Wait, let me try again!

636
00:43:24,334 --> 00:43:25,736
Alpha Waymond?

637
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,871
Evelyn?!

638
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,708
- Oh.
- Huh?

639
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,579
Ah!
What's happened to my hand?

640
00:43:40,984 --> 00:43:43,120
Go, go, go, go!

641
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,024
Evelyn, your face.

642
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,759
You just left me.

643
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,961
You just left me!

644
00:44:33,436 --> 00:44:34,271
Waymond...

645
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:38,408
Miss Deirdre?

646
00:44:38,441 --> 00:44:40,243
- I love you!
- What?

647
00:44:41,911 --> 00:44:43,146
I love you!

648
00:44:43,179 --> 00:44:45,616
No, no!

649
00:44:48,551 --> 00:44:49,720
I love you!

650
00:45:05,535 --> 00:45:08,605
I love you!

651
00:45:14,744 --> 00:45:16,747
I love...

652
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,436
Evelyn!

653
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,563
Cut, cut, cut, cut!

654
00:46:13,469 --> 00:46:16,006
Oh, I'm so
happy to be here today.

655
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,475
- Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

656
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:19,710
Evelyn!

657
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:02,085
Oh!

658
00:47:15,665 --> 00:47:18,502
Why did you... How?

659
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,349
It was beautiful.

660
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:45,896
Waymond.

661
00:47:46,963 --> 00:47:48,431
We better keep moving.

662
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:51,869
Now you've definitely
got Jobu's attention. Come on.

663
00:48:03,146 --> 00:48:04,681
Stay calm.

664
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:07,684
Your brain is under
an incredible amount of stress.

665
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:10,387
No, let me finish
talking with my husband.

666
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:13,156
He needs to know how good
my life could have been.

667
00:48:14,624 --> 00:48:16,960
- Evelyn! Evelyn!
- Evelyn!

668
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:23,433
- Ow!
- Are you with me?

669
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,236
I thought I was disconnected.

670
00:48:26,269 --> 00:48:27,704
Why was I still there?

671
00:48:27,737 --> 00:48:30,540
Your mind, it's like
a clay pot holding water.

672
00:48:30,573 --> 00:48:32,342
Every jump opens another crack,

673
00:48:32,375 --> 00:48:33,944
causing things to leak through.

674
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:36,647
With training, you will learn
to reseal these cracks.

675
00:48:38,414 --> 00:48:40,651
Eat. You need energy.

676
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,588
Cream cheese.

677
00:48:46,589 --> 00:48:47,724
Mmm!

678
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:51,161
In my universe,
the cattle were killed off.

679
00:48:51,194 --> 00:48:52,762
One of the many things
we've lost

680
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:54,631
in our war against Jobu.

681
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,902
Oh, my God.

682
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,437
What if...

683
00:49:01,270 --> 00:49:03,073
...what if I want to go back?

684
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,543
What if I want to go back
to the other universe?

685
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,145
Shut it down!
Shut it down, you hear me!

686
00:49:09,178 --> 00:49:11,081
- Come back!
- OK! OK! OK!

687
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,916
I... I'm back!

688
00:49:15,018 --> 00:49:16,720
Listen, you're only using

689
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,755
the other worlds to acquire
special skills.

690
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:19,990
Do you understand?

691
00:49:20,023 --> 00:49:21,300
If you fall
for their temptations,

692
00:49:21,324 --> 00:49:23,593
you invite contradiction, chaos.

693
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:27,831
The clay pot could shatter
and you could die, or far worse.

694
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:31,368
What can be worse than death?

695
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,871
We should keep moving
until reinforcements come.

696
00:49:34,904 --> 00:49:36,306
No, no, no!

697
00:49:36,339 --> 00:49:40,777
Enough of your clay pots,
cream cheese, no cows.

698
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:43,647
Explain it all to me now.

699
00:49:48,217 --> 00:49:49,820
You're right.

700
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:52,722
In the Alpha verse,

701
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:56,092
we began training many
young minds to Verse Jump.

702
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:59,262
But there was one who was far
and above the most gifted.

703
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:01,364
Our little explorer.

704
00:50:01,397 --> 00:50:03,433
You saw her potential...

705
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:05,702
...so you pushed her

706
00:50:05,735 --> 00:50:07,437
beyond her limit.

707
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:10,273
Warning. Unstable.

708
00:50:11,707 --> 00:50:13,485
Though the
overloaded mind usually dies,

709
00:50:13,509 --> 00:50:16,279
instead her mind was fractured.

710
00:50:17,213 --> 00:50:18,882
Warning. Unstable.

711
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,984
Mind fracturing.

712
00:50:23,986 --> 00:50:28,158
Now her mind
experiences every world,

713
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,526
every possibility,

714
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,594
at the same exact time,

715
00:50:31,627 --> 00:50:32,962
commanding
the infinite knowledge

716
00:50:32,995 --> 00:50:35,065
and power of the multiverse.

717
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:37,400
Now she's seen too much,

718
00:50:37,433 --> 00:50:39,169
lost any sense of morality,

719
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:41,271
any belief in objective truth.

720
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:43,540
What does she want?

721
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,875
No-one knows.

722
00:50:45,908 --> 00:50:47,277
All we know

723
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:49,746
is she's looking for you.

724
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:57,454
Hey, you said
I was the wrong one.

725
00:50:57,487 --> 00:51:00,924
What you did back there,
it changed my mind.

726
00:51:01,924 --> 00:51:04,461
You were incredible.

727
00:51:39,529 --> 00:51:41,131
Waymond.

728
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:07,390
Of course.

729
00:52:25,641 --> 00:52:27,243
Evelyn! Come back!

730
00:52:27,276 --> 00:52:28,687
Evelyn! Jump
to another combat universe!

731
00:52:28,711 --> 00:52:29,846
- Huh?
- Try peeing yourself!

732
00:52:29,879 --> 00:52:31,323
- Pee?
- It's always a good jumping pad!

733
00:52:35,184 --> 00:52:37,987
Come on, wake up! Wake up!

734
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,255
What did you do to me?

735
00:52:39,288 --> 00:52:41,624
Did you staple something
to my forehead?

736
00:52:41,657 --> 00:52:43,435
No! I didn't do anything.
You did it yourself!

737
00:52:43,459 --> 00:52:45,828
- Did we call for backup?
- I did not do it to myself!

738
00:52:45,861 --> 00:52:47,730
- Did you call?
- It has blood on it!

739
00:52:47,763 --> 00:52:51,401
We've detained the assailants.
No backup was requested.

740
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,269
You guys are wasting
a trip up. Copy?

741
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:58,041
Oh, no!
She found us.

742
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:00,476
I said, do you copy?

743
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:05,882
Clear them.

744
00:53:29,872 --> 00:53:31,107
Joy?

745
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:33,076
Why do you look so stupid?

746
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,678
Ma'am.

747
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:39,482
You and... your pig
can't be here.

748
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:49,226
Is it that I can't be here...

749
00:53:51,594 --> 00:53:53,463
...or that I'm not allowed...

750
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,231
- Huh!
- ..to be here?

751
00:53:55,264 --> 00:53:56,432
Hey!

752
00:53:56,465 --> 00:53:58,134
OK...

753
00:53:58,167 --> 00:53:59,469
Hands where I can see them.

754
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:02,872
See, I can physically be here.

755
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,642
But what you meant to say

756
00:54:05,675 --> 00:54:09,445
is you're not
allowing me to be here.

757
00:54:11,147 --> 00:54:12,782
Hands behind your back. Come on.

758
00:54:12,815 --> 00:54:15,285
Waymond!

759
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,787
You're going
to make me walk through you?

760
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:20,757
Yeah, cute.
I can't let you do that either.

761
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,660
Yeah, again with the 'can't'!

762
00:54:25,294 --> 00:54:26,729
See, I don't think
you understand

763
00:54:26,762 --> 00:54:28,965
the meaning of that word.

764
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:42,178
- See, I can walk through you.
- Officer down!

765
00:54:42,211 --> 00:54:44,347
- No, no! Don't shoot.
- Hands on your head.

766
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,216
Like this?

767
00:55:05,034 --> 00:55:07,970
- Waymond. Wake up! Wake up!
- Daddy!

768
00:55:09,638 --> 00:55:11,341
Oh, no!

769
00:55:16,278 --> 00:55:18,348
Oh, shit.

770
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:23,186
- Ugh!
- Oh!

771
00:55:23,219 --> 00:55:25,788
- No!
- Oh, no!

772
00:55:25,821 --> 00:55:28,658
Don't worry, Evelyn.

773
00:55:28,691 --> 00:55:30,793
- No, no! Oh, God!
- It's...

774
00:55:30,826 --> 00:55:33,529
Mmm! Organic.

775
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:39,836
Arggh...!

776
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:50,179
Oh, my God.

777
00:55:52,848 --> 00:55:54,217
You...

778
00:55:59,555 --> 00:56:02,959
You're Juju Toobootie.

779
00:56:05,227 --> 00:56:08,965
The "Great Evil" Waymond
was talking about is...

780
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,034
...in my Joy?

781
00:56:14,737 --> 00:56:16,305
Don't engage.

782
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:17,874
She can't be reasoned with.

783
00:56:25,981 --> 00:56:27,317
Oh...

784
00:56:28,284 --> 00:56:29,519
It's you.

785
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,754
You're the reason my daughter

786
00:56:31,787 --> 00:56:33,689
doesn't call anymore,

787
00:56:33,722 --> 00:56:35,658
why she dropped out of college

788
00:56:35,691 --> 00:56:37,393
and gets tattoos.

789
00:56:37,426 --> 00:56:39,028
Aww!

790
00:56:39,061 --> 00:56:41,431
You...

791
00:56:41,464 --> 00:56:44,300
...are why she thinks she is gay.

792
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:46,002
Ah!

793
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:48,037
I'm so sorry.

794
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:50,873
You're still hung up on the fact

795
00:56:50,906 --> 00:56:53,076
that I like girls in this world?

796
00:56:54,977 --> 00:56:57,246
The universe...

797
00:56:59,815 --> 00:57:02,518
...is so much bigger
than you realise.

798
00:57:02,551 --> 00:57:05,354
Huh?

799
00:57:05,387 --> 00:57:07,056
OK!

800
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:10,059
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

801
00:57:10,092 --> 00:57:11,027
Stop!

802
00:57:15,097 --> 00:57:17,266
- Huh!
- Don't make me fight you.

803
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:19,569
I am really good.

804
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,070
I don't believe you.

805
00:57:21,103 --> 00:57:22,772
OK, OK.

806
00:57:36,418 --> 00:57:37,687
Nice.

807
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,755
You peed yourself.

808
00:57:41,690 --> 00:57:43,359
No, Evelyn,
you're not locked in!

809
00:57:47,196 --> 00:57:48,898
Oh!

810
00:57:51,934 --> 00:57:53,169
Hmm.

811
00:57:54,937 --> 00:57:56,305
Where did she jump?

812
00:57:56,338 --> 00:57:58,441
Um, she's off the damn map.

813
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:04,180
♪ Flap your hands

814
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,483
She appears to be in a universe

815
00:58:07,516 --> 00:58:09,118
where everyone has...

816
00:58:09,151 --> 00:58:11,687
...hot dogs instead of fingers.

817
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:13,122
I mean, it just doesn't matter

818
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:16,792
how many times I see it,
I'm so moved.

819
00:58:16,825 --> 00:58:19,695
Oh, you stop it!

820
00:58:19,728 --> 00:58:20,972
An evolutionary branch

821
00:58:20,996 --> 00:58:22,966
in the anatomy
of the human race?

822
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:37,947
A jump like that

823
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:39,482
would've fried most people.

824
00:58:39,515 --> 00:58:41,050
Like I said...

825
00:58:41,817 --> 00:58:43,152
...she's not most people.

826
00:58:43,185 --> 00:58:45,454
Don't... Why are you
treating me like this?

827
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:46,956
One minute, you're so warm,

828
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:49,559
then one minute,
you're cold and awful.

829
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:53,996
This is crazy!

830
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:56,065
You're starting to get it.

831
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,068
Where are you gonna go?

832
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,243
Ugh!

833
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:09,412
You know, of all
the Evelyns I've seen...

834
00:59:10,913 --> 00:59:13,549
...you're definitely one of
the more interesting ones.

835
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:18,254
What do you want from me?

836
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:25,895
Here.

837
00:59:31,133 --> 00:59:34,070
Let me help you
open up your mind, huh?

838
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:36,839
Hmm?

839
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,609
- Oh!
- Here.

840
00:59:43,278 --> 00:59:45,848
Open up.

841
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:49,018
It's OK.

842
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,523
It's OK.

843
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:55,658
Take a peek.

844
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,509
Oh, shit.

845
01:00:13,542 --> 01:00:15,144
What is that?

846
01:00:15,177 --> 01:00:16,846
I got bored one day

847
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:20,083
and I put everything on a bagel.

848
01:00:22,584 --> 01:00:24,453
Everything.

849
01:00:24,486 --> 01:00:28,758
All my hopes and dreams,
my old report cards,

850
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,092
every breed of dog,

851
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:32,929
every last personal ad
on craigslist.

852
01:00:34,463 --> 01:00:35,698
Sesame.

853
01:00:35,731 --> 01:00:37,433
Poppy seed.

854
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,036
Salt.

855
01:00:41,036 --> 01:00:43,305
And it collapsed in on itself.

856
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:46,909
'Cause, you see,
when you really put

857
01:00:46,942 --> 01:00:49,645
everything on a bagel,

858
01:00:49,678 --> 01:00:51,714
it becomes this.

859
01:00:51,747 --> 01:00:53,716
Come on. Run, Evelyn.

860
01:00:53,749 --> 01:00:55,952
The truth.

861
01:00:57,252 --> 01:01:00,657
What is the truth?

862
01:01:02,624 --> 01:01:04,260
Nothing...

863
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:07,330
...matters.

864
01:01:09,698 --> 01:01:11,267
No, Joy.

865
01:01:12,034 --> 01:01:14,404
You don't believe that.

866
01:01:15,170 --> 01:01:17,573
Feels nice, doesn't it?

867
01:01:19,074 --> 01:01:21,077
If nothing matters...

868
01:01:21,877 --> 01:01:24,313
...then all the pain
and guilt you feel

869
01:01:24,346 --> 01:01:27,050
for making nothing
of your life...

870
01:01:28,484 --> 01:01:30,319
...it goes away.

871
01:01:35,057 --> 01:01:36,959
♪ Sucked

872
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:40,697
♪ Into

873
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,707
No!

874
01:02:00,015 --> 01:02:01,617
Ah Ba?

875
01:02:01,650 --> 01:02:03,352
I'm not your father.

876
01:02:03,385 --> 01:02:05,721
At least not the one you know.

877
01:02:05,754 --> 01:02:07,757
I am Alpha Gong Gong.

878
01:02:07,790 --> 01:02:09,725
- Huh!
- Not you too!

879
01:02:12,828 --> 01:02:14,964
Sir, what are you doing here?

880
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:17,366
We need to go.
Just follow me.

881
01:02:32,981 --> 01:02:34,359
Sir,
I have this under control.

882
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:37,253
Again,
you deliberately disobey me

883
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:40,990
and cause another mind
to be compromised.

884
01:02:44,126 --> 01:02:47,963
And now you know
what we must do.

885
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:50,332
No! Please.

886
01:02:50,365 --> 01:02:52,301
She's unlike anything
we've seen.

887
01:02:52,334 --> 01:02:55,070
She could finally stop
Jobu Tupaki.

888
01:02:55,103 --> 01:02:57,673
You mean the monster
that is inside my daughter?

889
01:02:57,706 --> 01:03:00,276
Well, why didn't you tell me
about it earlier?

890
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,878
What else are you Alpha people
not telling me?

891
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,181
Did you see her
dance that man to death?

892
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:09,652
There is no way I am
the Evelyn you are looking for.

893
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:12,021
No, I see it so clearly.

894
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:14,123
See what?

895
01:03:15,624 --> 01:03:18,260
I'm no good at anything.

896
01:03:18,293 --> 01:03:19,495
Exactly.

897
01:03:19,528 --> 01:03:21,964
I've seen thousands of Evelyns,

898
01:03:21,997 --> 01:03:24,366
but never an Evelyn like you.

899
01:03:24,399 --> 01:03:27,236
You have so many goals
you never finished,

900
01:03:27,269 --> 01:03:29,939
dreams you never followed.

901
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,642
You're living your worst you.

902
01:03:34,509 --> 01:03:37,880
I cannot be the worst.
What about that hot dog one?

903
01:03:37,913 --> 01:03:40,182
No. Can't you see?

904
01:03:40,215 --> 01:03:43,052
Every failure here
branched off into a success

905
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:45,020
for another Evelyn
in another life.

906
01:03:45,053 --> 01:03:48,157
Most people only
have a few significant

907
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:50,559
alternate life paths
so close to them.

908
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:52,895
But you, here,

909
01:03:52,928 --> 01:03:55,865
you're capable of anything

910
01:03:55,898 --> 01:03:59,135
because you're so bad
at everything.

911
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,374
What good is all that power
when her mind

912
01:04:05,407 --> 01:04:09,144
is already succumbing
to that chaos, huh?

913
01:04:09,177 --> 01:04:11,847
Hello?

914
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:13,682
Hello? Mom, Dad?
What's going on?

915
01:04:13,715 --> 01:04:16,285
No. Do not answer her.

916
01:04:16,318 --> 01:04:18,621
It's one of her tricks.

917
01:04:18,654 --> 01:04:21,891
Sir, our readings indicate
it's not Jobu Tupaki.

918
01:04:22,891 --> 01:04:24,260
But if she's not here...

919
01:04:27,863 --> 01:04:29,031
Oh, shit!

920
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:35,604
Do not engage! Run! Run!

921
01:04:35,637 --> 01:04:38,407
Watch these two here
while I deal with Jobu.

922
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,544
I'm not risking the safety
of the Alpha verse for this.

923
01:04:46,248 --> 01:04:48,384
Get us as far away
from Joy as you can.

924
01:04:48,417 --> 01:04:49,952
- Why?
- I'll be back. I promise.

925
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:52,121
No, no, no, wait.
Why don't you...

926
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:53,222
Huh?

927
01:04:53,255 --> 01:04:54,890
- Hello?
- Joy?

928
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:56,167
- No, no... That's not...
- Joy's here!

929
01:04:56,191 --> 01:04:57,602
- No, no, no, that's not Joy.
- Hello?

930
01:04:57,626 --> 01:05:01,230
- Joy? Joy, I'm coming.
- Let me in.

931
01:05:01,263 --> 01:05:04,467
OK, be patient!
This is heavy.

932
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,170
- Joy, why are you here?
- I have no fucking clue!

933
01:05:08,203 --> 01:05:10,306
- Hey, gentle language!
- Just what is going on?

934
01:05:10,339 --> 01:05:12,875
I'm sure there's a very good
explanation for all of this...

935
01:05:14,276 --> 01:05:16,779
What the fuck, Mom?!

936
01:05:17,913 --> 01:05:19,882
What the fuck are you doing?

937
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:30,393
But... she's too powerful.

938
01:05:31,693 --> 01:05:34,263
Are we all having a stroke?

939
01:05:43,638 --> 01:05:46,342
You are like puppets.
You know? Puppets?

940
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,078
You can do things
you normally cannot do.

941
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,180
It's like that movie.

942
01:05:51,213 --> 01:05:53,482
Um, you... you... That movie...

943
01:05:53,515 --> 01:05:54,984
OK, what are you talking about?

944
01:05:55,017 --> 01:05:56,685
- A movie?
- 'Raccaccoonie'!

945
01:05:56,718 --> 01:05:57,853
- What?
- Huh?

946
01:05:57,886 --> 01:05:58,821
'Raccaccoonie', you know?

947
01:05:58,854 --> 01:06:00,889
The one with the chef...

948
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:02,558
And he makes bad food. Phooey.

949
01:06:02,591 --> 01:06:04,660
And then this raccoon
sit on his head,

950
01:06:04,693 --> 01:06:08,797
ooh, control him,
and then he cooks good food.

951
01:06:08,830 --> 01:06:11,000
Do you mean 'Ratatouille'?

952
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,568
'Ratatouille'?
I like that movie.

953
01:06:12,601 --> 01:06:14,970
No. No, no, no, no, no.
'Raccaccoonie'!

954
01:06:15,003 --> 01:06:16,138
With the raccoon.

955
01:06:16,171 --> 01:06:17,706
- OK...
- Raccoon?

956
01:06:17,739 --> 01:06:19,475
Everybody,
stop making up sounds!

957
01:06:19,508 --> 01:06:22,644
So there's a raccoon Joy,
and there's a raccoon me?

958
01:06:22,677 --> 01:06:24,389
And they are controlling us?

959
01:06:24,413 --> 01:06:26,248
Yeah, from the other universes.

960
01:06:28,183 --> 01:06:30,052
- Oh. OK.
- That's very funny, Evelyn.

961
01:06:30,085 --> 01:06:33,789
OK, it sounds a little bit
ridiculous, but it's true.

962
01:06:33,822 --> 01:06:35,324
I swear to God, you...

963
01:06:35,357 --> 01:06:36,725
You are macho man.

964
01:06:36,758 --> 01:06:38,494
- I like that!
- Oh, yeah.

965
01:06:41,029 --> 01:06:42,306
Hey, honey,
don't worry.

966
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:44,099
- Daddy will get you out of this.
- Ah Ba?

967
01:06:44,132 --> 01:06:47,436
Quickly,
while she is distracted.

968
01:06:48,236 --> 01:06:50,339
- No.
- It's only protocol.

969
01:06:50,372 --> 01:06:53,275
It gives her one
less universe to access.

970
01:06:53,308 --> 01:06:54,585
God...

971
01:06:54,609 --> 01:06:56,412
- Can you...
- Oh, it's Becky.

972
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:57,913
Hi, Becky. Hold on.

973
01:06:57,946 --> 01:07:00,149
How do you expect to defeat
her in every universe

974
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,884
if you can't even
kill her in one?

975
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,285
Hey, babe.

976
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:05,287
She's your granddaughter.

977
01:07:06,054 --> 01:07:09,224
How do you think I feel?

978
01:07:09,257 --> 01:07:11,193
But this is a sacrifice

979
01:07:11,226 --> 01:07:13,829
that is necessary
to win the war.

980
01:07:13,862 --> 01:07:16,465
OK, there we go.

981
01:07:20,769 --> 01:07:22,505
You must do it.

982
01:07:23,738 --> 01:07:25,374
Go.

983
01:07:28,176 --> 01:07:29,478
Go.

984
01:07:29,511 --> 01:07:31,613
Yeah, my mom
taped me to a chair.

985
01:07:31,646 --> 01:07:33,782
Uh, because of raccoons.

986
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:35,893
- OK, be patient.
- Yeah, it's a long story.

987
01:07:35,917 --> 01:07:37,953
- Daddy's trying to...
- It's been a day.

988
01:07:45,594 --> 01:07:46,662
Mom?

989
01:07:46,695 --> 01:07:48,330
I don't
like this at all.

990
01:07:57,873 --> 01:07:59,575
What are you...

991
01:08:01,977 --> 01:08:03,746
...what are you doing?

992
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:09,151
Hey! I almost had it.

993
01:08:09,184 --> 01:08:10,652
Oh, come on!

994
01:08:10,685 --> 01:08:12,087
You are already under her spell.

995
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,289
Holy shit!
Holy shit, he has a gun!

996
01:08:14,322 --> 01:08:15,557
Everyone, stay calm!

997
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:17,201
I think it's time
for a family discussion!

998
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:19,294
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

999
01:08:22,631 --> 01:08:25,000
I won't let you kill her.

1000
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:28,737
Don't you see what
is happening to your mind?

1001
01:08:29,971 --> 01:08:31,707
In my universe,

1002
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:36,011
you pushed your own daughter
too hard until you broke her.

1003
01:08:36,044 --> 01:08:38,914
You...

1004
01:08:38,947 --> 01:08:41,817
...you created Jobu Tupaki.

1005
01:08:41,850 --> 01:08:43,919
When did he get
so good at English?

1006
01:08:45,053 --> 01:08:47,122
Now I must stop you.

1007
01:08:47,155 --> 01:08:49,258
Otherwise, it's only
a matter of time

1008
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:53,696
before you become just like her.

1009
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:59,501
Just like her?

1010
01:09:05,607 --> 01:09:08,677
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you doing?

1011
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:11,547
Evelyn, I don't think now
is a good time to dance!

1012
01:09:15,183 --> 01:09:16,518
Baba,

1013
01:09:16,551 --> 01:09:18,253
I know you don't agree with me,

1014
01:09:18,286 --> 01:09:19,821
but this is something
I have to do.

1015
01:09:19,854 --> 01:09:21,523
- What the...
- That sounds weird.

1016
01:09:21,556 --> 01:09:23,325
No, no, no...

1017
01:09:23,358 --> 01:09:25,260
- OK.
- Wait!

1018
01:09:25,293 --> 01:09:26,537
You don't know
where you'll jump.

1019
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:31,167
Enough!

1020
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:33,969
Warning. Unstable.

1021
01:09:46,047 --> 01:09:47,516
Please.

1022
01:09:47,549 --> 01:09:50,552
I cannot lose another
loved one to the darkness.

1023
01:09:50,585 --> 01:09:54,723
- Warning. Unstable.
- Don't worry. You won't.

1024
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:10,239
Hey, uh, clean up
in there, alright?

1025
01:10:10,272 --> 01:10:11,974
Here. Oh!

1026
01:10:14,576 --> 01:10:16,011
Where did she jump?!

1027
01:10:16,044 --> 01:10:17,713
Sorry, Ah Ba.

1028
01:10:20,248 --> 01:10:22,017
- Whoa!
- OK!

1029
01:10:22,050 --> 01:10:23,628
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Jesus, Mom!

1030
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:24,892
- That way!
- Oh, no!

1031
01:10:24,919 --> 01:10:26,697
- Oh, my God!
- Come on, come on!

1032
01:10:26,721 --> 01:10:28,090
- Oh!
- No!

1033
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:30,759
Warning, mind fracturing.

1034
01:10:30,792 --> 01:10:34,396
Send every Jumper with
a counterpart in the area.

1035
01:10:34,429 --> 01:10:36,632
Now!

1036
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:40,235
Once again,
the Alpha verse finds itself

1037
01:10:40,268 --> 01:10:44,740
as the last line of defence
against total chaos.

1038
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:48,877
Be brave. This Evelyn
is as stubborn as the others.

1039
01:10:48,910 --> 01:10:51,079
She has given us no choice.

1040
01:10:51,112 --> 01:10:55,651
We must kill her before she
becomes another Jobu Tupaki.

1041
01:10:57,485 --> 01:10:59,888
- Joy.
- Oh, what?

1042
01:10:59,921 --> 01:11:01,757
Joy... Joy...

1043
01:11:02,657 --> 01:11:06,828
I know you have these feelings,

1044
01:11:06,861 --> 01:11:10,699
feelings that make you so sad.

1045
01:11:11,499 --> 01:11:15,871
That makes you just...
just want to give up.

1046
01:11:17,238 --> 01:11:19,074
It's not your fault.

1047
01:11:20,041 --> 01:11:21,577
Not your fault.

1048
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,246
I know.

1049
01:11:25,313 --> 01:11:27,449
It's... it's her.

1050
01:11:27,482 --> 01:11:30,285
Juju Chewbacca.

1051
01:11:32,387 --> 01:11:35,757
She has your soul...

1052
01:11:35,790 --> 01:11:37,559
...in the palm of her hand.

1053
01:11:37,592 --> 01:11:38,894
What are you talking about?

1054
01:11:38,927 --> 01:11:43,065
The only way I can
defeat her to save you...

1055
01:11:44,132 --> 01:11:46,635
...is to become like her.

1056
01:11:50,705 --> 01:11:52,007
Evelyn!

1057
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:54,409
Your daughter is beyond saving.

1058
01:11:54,442 --> 01:11:56,578
And soon you will be too.

1059
01:12:00,682 --> 01:12:02,417
Your time is up.

1060
01:12:02,450 --> 01:12:04,820
Find your jumping pads.

1061
01:12:24,472 --> 01:12:26,742
Mom? Mom?

1062
01:12:26,775 --> 01:12:29,345
I think
you're pushing things too far.

1063
01:12:31,446 --> 01:12:32,914
Or not far enough.

1064
01:12:34,682 --> 01:12:36,852
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1065
01:12:39,587 --> 01:12:41,123
Evelyn?

1066
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:42,824
- Ugh!
- Oh, my God.

1067
01:12:45,593 --> 01:12:46,862
Oh!

1068
01:12:46,895 --> 01:12:48,639
What are you doing?!

1069
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:52,427
Mom!

1070
01:14:48,216 --> 01:14:49,284
Arggh!

1071
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:55,791
Ohh!

1072
01:15:10,705 --> 01:15:13,542
Holy... shit.

1073
01:15:13,575 --> 01:15:15,143
Is he dead?

1074
01:15:17,845 --> 01:15:19,948
See, not dead. Go!

1075
01:15:19,981 --> 01:15:22,181
- That's definitely not...
- Hurry up, please. Go quick!

1076
01:15:22,750 --> 01:15:24,753
OK, come on, guys.

1077
01:15:27,088 --> 01:15:28,523
Dad, go!

1078
01:15:35,563 --> 01:15:37,032
Oh, my God.

1079
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:43,205
Does my baby
want to go for a walk?

1080
01:15:51,946 --> 01:15:53,648
Yow!

1081
01:15:56,117 --> 01:15:57,953
No!

1082
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,455
Oh, Johnny! Oh!

1083
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,125
Orange soda?

1084
01:16:04,158 --> 01:16:05,961
- Huh?
- What is she doing?

1085
01:16:05,994 --> 01:16:07,771
I think when
she does something weird

1086
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:09,564
it helps her fight,
it gives her power.

1087
01:16:12,634 --> 01:16:13,969
Sorry, baby.

1088
01:16:20,308 --> 01:16:23,478
Ask her for another one.

1089
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,887
No! Johnny!

1090
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,328
Fried egg?

1091
01:16:40,461 --> 01:16:43,632
You... bitch.

1092
01:16:46,834 --> 01:16:48,403
Go!

1093
01:16:49,804 --> 01:16:52,140
Huh?

1094
01:16:52,173 --> 01:16:53,909
Oh...

1095
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:56,044
Evelyn, if you don't step up,

1096
01:16:56,077 --> 01:16:57,946
I'm giving some
of your shifts to Chad.

1097
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:02,717
Yeah!

1098
01:17:02,750 --> 01:17:04,519
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, good one!

1099
01:17:04,552 --> 01:17:05,820
I got a picture!

1100
01:17:18,633 --> 01:17:20,402
Go.

1101
01:18:03,811 --> 01:18:05,280
Stop...

1102
01:18:05,313 --> 01:18:06,990
- Huh? What happened?
- You stop!

1103
01:18:07,014 --> 01:18:08,149
I think they lost their...

1104
01:18:08,182 --> 01:18:09,951
- Stop it!
- ..powers?

1105
01:18:10,918 --> 01:18:12,353
Sir?

1106
01:18:12,386 --> 01:18:14,456
I am gonna need
another jumping pad.

1107
01:18:14,489 --> 01:18:16,658
Received information. Over.

1108
01:18:23,264 --> 01:18:25,042
I think she needs to do
something weird again.

1109
01:18:25,066 --> 01:18:26,601
What's he doing?

1110
01:18:37,411 --> 01:18:39,881
Oh, my God. He's trying
to stick it in his butt.

1111
01:18:39,914 --> 01:18:41,683
No!

1112
01:18:42,784 --> 01:18:44,219
- No, no, no!
- Ah... No!

1113
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:48,056
Ah, Evelyn, do jumping jacks!

1114
01:18:48,089 --> 01:18:49,457
That's not weird at all.

1115
01:18:49,490 --> 01:18:50,892
Um... Slap him!

1116
01:18:50,925 --> 01:18:52,594
No, no, no, no!

1117
01:18:52,627 --> 01:18:54,696
Mom, just blow on his nose!

1118
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:55,997
What?

1119
01:18:56,030 --> 01:18:57,599
It'll make him involuntarily

1120
01:18:57,632 --> 01:18:59,267
scream and do weird noises.

1121
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,736
Trust her, Evelyn!
It's really weird.

1122
01:19:54,388 --> 01:19:56,157
Wow, Mom is really good.

1123
01:19:56,190 --> 01:19:58,360
Huh!

1124
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:01,396
Sorry.

1125
01:20:21,015 --> 01:20:22,417
Oh!

1126
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:26,154
Arggh!

1127
01:20:34,061 --> 01:20:35,730
Ahh!

1128
01:20:56,384 --> 01:20:58,186
Reaching mental capacity.

1129
01:21:00,054 --> 01:21:01,689
Reaching mental capacity.

1130
01:21:03,925 --> 01:21:04,893
Holy shit!

1131
01:21:06,193 --> 01:21:09,197
- Ow!
- I'm sorry, Evelyn.

1132
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:11,366
- Mind fracturing.
- We'll die together.

1133
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,154
Pinky... Arggh!

1134
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:37,559
- Get her. I see her.
- Let's go!

1135
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,228
Evelyn!

1136
01:22:14,261 --> 01:22:16,164
Evelyn. Evelyn!

1137
01:22:16,197 --> 01:22:17,341
Whoa, whoa!

1138
01:22:21,969 --> 01:22:24,205
No need to explain.

1139
01:22:26,107 --> 01:22:27,976
I have been watching you.

1140
01:22:28,009 --> 01:22:30,645
You're back!

1141
01:22:31,545 --> 01:22:33,548
Did you see how good I am?

1142
01:22:34,648 --> 01:22:36,150
I'm gonna do it.

1143
01:22:36,183 --> 01:22:39,887
I am going to defeat
that Jobu Tupaki.

1144
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:42,657
Hey. You got her name right.

1145
01:22:44,225 --> 01:22:48,830
Evelyn, what you're doing
is crazy, reckless.

1146
01:22:48,863 --> 01:22:52,333
Your stupid plan to somehow
save your daughter

1147
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:56,271
has managed to piss off
everyone in the multiverse.

1148
01:22:57,471 --> 01:22:59,507
But it just might work.

1149
01:23:03,144 --> 01:23:04,445
What? What?

1150
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,861
I only wish
I could be there

1151
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:21,095
to see you finish this.

1152
01:23:21,128 --> 01:23:23,064
What do you mean,
you don't see me finish?

1153
01:23:23,097 --> 01:23:25,166
I'm grateful

1154
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:26,834
that chance was kind enough

1155
01:23:26,867 --> 01:23:29,771

last few moments together.

Alpha Waymond?

1158
01:23:49,957 --> 01:23:52,126
What happened?

1159
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:54,496
Was I Raccoon Waymond again?

1160
01:23:57,565 --> 01:23:59,400
Raccoon Waymond is dead.

1161
01:24:03,070 --> 01:24:04,873
Is that Raccoon Joy?

Am I getting it?

1163
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:11,446
I can to stop you,
Jobu...

1164
01:24:11,479 --> 01:24:14,749
...now that I am reaching
my full potential.

1165
01:24:14,782 --> 01:24:17,285
Oh, you still can't see
what's happening.

1166
01:24:17,318 --> 01:24:19,387
No, I see clearly.

1167
01:24:19,420 --> 01:24:22,924
More clearly than ever before.

Hi, Mrs Wang.

1210
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,981
Hey, Mom.
So, about this morning...

1211
01:28:41,014 --> 01:28:42,750
- Enough with your tricks.
- What?

1212
01:28:42,783 --> 01:28:44,060
- I know you're in there.
- Whoa.

1213
01:28:44,084 --> 01:28:45,595
- Get out of my daughter.
- OK!

1214
01:28:45,619 --> 01:28:47,221
Mom, are you already drunk?

1215
01:28:51,358 --> 01:28:53,361
- Hey, Becky.
- Mmm-hmm?

1216
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:57,265
Can you go help my dad
with the party?

1217
01:28:59,133 --> 01:29:00,634
Now?

1218
01:29:00,667 --> 01:29:02,737
- Yeah.
- Go, Becky.

1219
01:29:02,770 --> 01:29:04,538
Go. Go.

1220
01:29:07,107 --> 01:29:08,776
Thanks, babe.

1221
01:29:12,746 --> 01:29:14,882
You see it all, don't you?

1222
01:29:19,553 --> 01:29:22,523
You can see

1223
01:29:22,556 --> 01:29:24,392
how everything...

1224
01:29:25,526 --> 01:29:27,762
...is just a random rearrangement

1225
01:29:27,795 --> 01:29:32,166
of particles
in a vibrating superposition.

1226
01:29:37,671 --> 01:29:40,074
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

1227
01:29:40,107 --> 01:29:42,276
But I can do this.

1228
01:29:43,710 --> 01:29:45,179
Huh?

1229
01:29:45,212 --> 01:29:47,581
But you see...

1230
01:29:47,614 --> 01:29:49,784
...how everything we do...

1231
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:51,619
Huh?

1232
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,923
...gets washed away in a sea

1233
01:29:55,956 --> 01:29:58,292
of every other possibility?

1234
01:30:02,362 --> 01:30:03,965
You're everywhere.

1235
01:30:06,233 --> 01:30:07,802
You're like me.

1236
01:30:08,569 --> 01:30:09,904
That's right.

1237
01:30:09,937 --> 01:30:12,573
I'm the one you're looking for.

1238
01:30:12,606 --> 01:30:15,109
I'm the one
who's going to defeat you.

1239
01:30:15,142 --> 01:30:17,011
OK.

1240
01:30:19,012 --> 01:30:20,748
Hit me.

1241
01:30:22,549 --> 01:30:24,152
Punch my face.

1242
01:30:32,793 --> 01:30:34,361
Oh...

1243
01:30:34,394 --> 01:30:36,430
Oh! Ow! Ow!

1244
01:30:36,463 --> 01:30:39,200
- Oh, stop!
- Wow.

1245
01:30:41,335 --> 01:30:43,404
Hi, Dad.

1246
01:30:45,772 --> 01:30:48,909
We're... we're just practising
karaoke for tonight.

1247
01:30:52,346 --> 01:30:54,014
I will take care of it!

1248
01:30:54,047 --> 01:30:56,116
- She'll take care of it, Dad.
- Go.

1249
01:30:56,149 --> 01:30:57,360
- Honey, you OK?
- It's OK.

1250
01:30:57,384 --> 01:30:59,653
- Go!
- Yeah, I just fell on the couch.

1251
01:30:59,686 --> 01:31:01,155
Go!

1252
01:31:01,188 --> 01:31:02,757
OK.

1253
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:05,826
Oh.

1254
01:31:05,859 --> 01:31:07,462
- Ow...
- He's so sweet.

1255
01:31:09,263 --> 01:31:11,265
OK.

1256
01:31:11,298 --> 01:31:12,967
Hey, hey, buddy!

1257
01:31:13,000 --> 01:31:17,271
If you don't want
to fight me, then...

1258
01:31:17,304 --> 01:31:18,973
- Why?
- Why what?

1259
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:20,841
What... what's all this for?

1260
01:31:22,843 --> 01:31:25,379
Why was I looking for you?

1261
01:31:25,412 --> 01:31:26,981
Yeah.

1262
01:31:30,484 --> 01:31:32,186
Sit down.

1263
01:31:32,953 --> 01:31:34,722
Sit down, grab a snack,

1264
01:31:34,755 --> 01:31:36,590
make yourself comfortable, huh?

1265
01:31:36,623 --> 01:31:39,093
- Oh, hey, you OK?
- OK.

1266
01:31:40,527 --> 01:31:43,531
Mmm. We can speed this up.

1267
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:46,867
Sit on the crack.

1268
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,169
Sit on the crack
of the couch, OK?

1269
01:31:49,202 --> 01:31:50,404
Get comfortable.

1270
01:32:01,682 --> 01:32:03,350
Bagel.

1271
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,123
Please, I don't care
about the bagel.

1272
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:11,025
I don't care
about the Alpha verse.

1273
01:32:11,058 --> 01:32:12,860
I only care about my Joy.

1274
01:32:12,893 --> 01:32:14,128
Give me back my daughter

1275
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:15,796
and I'll leave you
alone forever.

1276
01:32:15,829 --> 01:32:18,299
Sorry! No can do.

1277
01:32:18,332 --> 01:32:19,433
Why not?

1278
01:32:19,466 --> 01:32:22,136
I am your daughter.
Your daughter is me.

1279
01:32:22,169 --> 01:32:26,907
Every version of Joy
is Jobu Tupaki.

1280
01:32:26,940 --> 01:32:29,510
- You can't separate us.
- No.

1281
01:32:29,543 --> 01:32:34,181
I have felt everything
your daughter has felt.

1282
01:32:37,918 --> 01:32:41,522
And I know the joy...

1283
01:32:42,923 --> 01:32:45,927
...and the pain of having you
as my mother.

1284
01:32:47,694 --> 01:32:50,230
Then you know
I would do...

1285
01:32:50,263 --> 01:32:54,402
Only do the right thing
for her, for you.

1286
01:32:55,402 --> 01:32:59,440
'Right' is a tiny box invented
by people who are afraid

1287
01:32:59,473 --> 01:33:03,444
and I know what it feels like
to be trapped inside that box.

1288
01:33:06,413 --> 01:33:07,982
Mom...

1289
01:33:08,015 --> 01:33:09,917
No,
it's not like that.

1290
01:33:09,950 --> 01:33:11,552
It's Gong Gong.

1291
01:33:11,585 --> 01:33:12,886
He's a different generation.

1292
01:33:12,919 --> 01:33:15,356
You don't have to hide
behind him anymore.

1293
01:33:15,389 --> 01:33:17,091
You should feel relieved.

1294
01:33:17,124 --> 01:33:20,494
The bagel will show you
the true nature of things.

1295
01:33:20,527 --> 01:33:23,831
You'll be free from that box,
just like me.

1296
01:33:23,864 --> 01:33:26,166
No, no,
I'm not like you.

1297
01:33:26,199 --> 01:33:29,536
You're young and your mind
is always changing.

1298
01:33:29,569 --> 01:33:31,739
I still know who I am.

1299
01:33:31,772 --> 01:33:33,974
You have no idea
what you've done.

1300
01:33:34,007 --> 01:33:36,611
You're stuck like this forever.

1301
01:33:38,178 --> 01:33:41,015
No, I'm going back with my Joy,

1302
01:33:41,048 --> 01:33:44,318
to my family, to live my life.

1303
01:33:44,351 --> 01:33:45,753
A happy life.

1304
01:33:45,786 --> 01:33:47,755
OK.

1305
01:33:49,790 --> 01:33:51,959
Good luck with that.

1306
01:34:04,938 --> 01:34:06,315
Thank you so much for coming.

1307
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:13,547
Thank you.
Thank your father.

1308
01:34:26,993 --> 01:34:29,096
All this time...

1309
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:34,068
...I wasn't looking for you
so I could kill you.

1310
01:34:36,503 --> 01:34:40,941
I was just looking for someone
who could see what I see.

1311
01:34:42,976 --> 01:34:46,414
Feel what I feel.

1312
01:35:08,568 --> 01:35:10,771
And that someone...

1313
01:35:15,008 --> 01:35:16,744
...is you.

1314
01:35:18,545 --> 01:35:20,414
Evelyn!

1315
01:35:20,447 --> 01:35:23,284
- You're alive!
- Impossible.

1316
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:29,089
- Hello?
- Mrs Wang?

1317
01:35:29,122 --> 01:35:30,524
Where... where are you?

1318
01:35:30,557 --> 01:35:34,361
I mean, to not even show up
for your appointment?!

1319
01:35:34,394 --> 01:35:35,629
Shut up.

1320
01:35:35,662 --> 01:35:36,864
What did you just say?

1321
01:35:36,897 --> 01:35:38,766
I said shut up.

1322
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:40,267
You don't matter.

1323
01:35:40,300 --> 01:35:42,336
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

1324
01:35:42,369 --> 01:35:43,637
Nothing matters.

1325
01:35:43,670 --> 01:35:45,506
Mrs Wang!

1326
01:35:45,539 --> 01:35:48,642
You are gonna
be in serious trouble!

1327
01:35:48,675 --> 01:35:50,544
Do you understand?

1328
01:35:50,577 --> 01:35:52,980
For you to disrespect...

1329
01:36:19,005 --> 01:36:22,509
Happy New Year!

1330
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:24,344
Another year, hmm?

1331
01:36:24,377 --> 01:36:26,280
Pretending we know
what we're doing,

1332
01:36:26,313 --> 01:36:30,518
but, really, we're just going
around in circles.

1333
01:36:31,785 --> 01:36:34,188
Doing laundry and taxes,

1334
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:36,257
and laundry and taxes.

1335
01:36:44,231 --> 01:36:45,775
- No more running.
- Excuse me.

1336
01:36:45,799 --> 01:36:48,135
Where are the owners? Oh.

1337
01:36:48,902 --> 01:36:51,005
There you are.
Mr and Mrs Wang.

1338
01:36:51,771 --> 01:36:56,410
You have left me no option
but to authorise the seizure

1339
01:36:56,443 --> 01:36:58,979
of your personal
and your business assets.

1340
01:36:59,012 --> 01:37:00,781
- You have to vacate...
- Wait, Evelyn!

1341
01:37:07,587 --> 01:37:09,756
It's just so good,
you know?

1342
01:37:09,789 --> 01:37:11,634
What are you doing? No! No!

1343
01:37:11,658 --> 01:37:14,294
My God, Chad, I told
you she couldn't be trusted!

1344
01:37:14,327 --> 01:37:16,397
Evelyn, please! Calm down.

1345
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:19,566
..within 48 hours or...

1346
01:37:27,807 --> 01:37:29,476
Everything...

1347
01:37:32,746 --> 01:37:34,014
Ugh!

1348
01:37:39,853 --> 01:37:41,622
What are you doing?

1349
01:37:47,627 --> 01:37:50,097
Not a single moment
will go by

1350
01:37:50,130 --> 01:37:51,965
without every other universe

1351
01:37:51,998 --> 01:37:54,335
screaming for your attention.

1352
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:58,872
Never fully there.

1353
01:37:58,905 --> 01:38:01,475
Just a lifetime of...

1354
01:38:01,508 --> 01:38:02,910
No, no!

1355
01:38:02,943 --> 01:38:04,111
...fractured moments.

1356
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:06,013
Raccaccoonie!

1357
01:38:06,046 --> 01:38:08,715
..contradictions
and confusion...

1358
01:38:08,748 --> 01:38:10,851
- Get off me!
- Chad, don't forget about me.

1359
01:38:10,884 --> 01:38:12,319
Here are the papers.

1360
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:16,557
- Oh! Oh, officer?
- OK, OK.

1361
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:25,666
...with only a few specks of time

1362
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:28,936
where anything
actually makes any sense.

1363
01:38:31,237 --> 01:38:34,508
I've always hated this place.

1364
01:38:40,981 --> 01:38:42,516
Raccaccoonie!

1365
01:38:42,549 --> 01:38:44,084
Chad!

1366
01:38:46,820 --> 01:38:49,690
Get off me! Get off!

1367
01:39:01,301 --> 01:39:03,737
Evelyn, why?!

1368
01:42:11,457 --> 01:42:14,394
Do you know why
I actually built the bagel?

1369
01:42:15,428 --> 01:42:18,665
It wasn't to destroy everything.

1370
01:42:19,566 --> 01:42:22,035
It was to destroy myself.

1371
01:42:23,036 --> 01:42:27,107
I wanted to see if I went in,
could I finally escape?

1372
01:42:29,275 --> 01:42:31,645
Like, actually die.

1373
01:42:34,113 --> 01:42:36,150
At least this way...

1374
01:42:37,317 --> 01:42:39,153
...I don't have to do it alone.

1375
01:42:45,491 --> 01:42:47,160
You're not listening.

1376
01:42:47,193 --> 01:42:49,062
This is out of my league...

1377
01:42:49,095 --> 01:42:51,331
Judge Brenner signed...

1378
01:42:54,634 --> 01:42:58,038
Well, excuse me!
Excuse me, Mr Wang.

1379
01:42:58,071 --> 01:42:59,982
Every person I know
is going through a hard time.

1380
01:43:00,006 --> 01:43:02,910
- It's a hard time...
- Evelyn!

1381
01:43:06,112 --> 01:43:07,915
Come back.

1382
01:43:12,552 --> 01:43:15,088
My silly husband.

1383
01:43:15,121 --> 01:43:18,225
Probably making things worse.

1384
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,027
Ignore it.

1385
01:43:25,298 --> 01:43:27,534
OK, you can let her go.

1386
01:43:28,801 --> 01:43:33,607
You, let her go. It's OK. Yes!

1387
01:43:35,375 --> 01:43:37,010
Thank you.

1388
01:43:52,358 --> 01:43:55,095
How? That's impossible.

1389
01:43:55,128 --> 01:43:57,631
It's just
a statistical inevitability.

1390
01:43:57,664 --> 01:43:59,733
It's nothing special.

1391
01:44:08,341 --> 01:44:10,010
I don't know.

1392
01:44:10,043 --> 01:44:12,079
I just talked to her.

1393
01:44:52,952 --> 01:44:54,221
Please!

1394
01:44:58,458 --> 01:44:59,693
Please!

1395
01:44:59,726 --> 01:45:02,662
Can we...
can we just stop fighting?

1396
01:45:17,410 --> 01:45:18,745
I know you are all fighting

1397
01:45:18,778 --> 01:45:22,115
because you're scared
and confused.

1398
01:45:24,050 --> 01:45:26,053
I'm confused too.

1399
01:45:29,489 --> 01:45:31,058
All day...

1400
01:45:32,592 --> 01:45:35,162
...I don't know
what the heck is going on.

1401
01:45:36,229 --> 01:45:38,765
But somehow...

1402
01:45:39,699 --> 01:45:42,102
...this feels like
it's all my fault.

1403
01:45:57,850 --> 01:46:00,387
I don't know.

1404
01:46:02,422 --> 01:46:04,324
The only thing I do know...

1405
01:46:05,291 --> 01:46:07,394
...is that we have to be kind.

1406
01:46:12,999 --> 01:46:14,601
Please.

1407
01:46:14,634 --> 01:46:16,269
Be kind...

1408
01:46:17,036 --> 01:46:20,073
...especially when
we don't know what's going on.

1409
01:46:39,325 --> 01:46:40,894
Hey, Evelyn!

1410
01:46:42,395 --> 01:46:44,030
Bagel.

1411
01:46:46,532 --> 01:46:49,302
Evelyn...

1412
01:46:50,903 --> 01:46:54,174
You can still turn around
and avoid all this.

1413
01:46:54,207 --> 01:46:55,742
Please...

1414
01:46:56,509 --> 01:46:58,044
...be kind.

1415
01:47:00,813 --> 01:47:03,616
It's too late, Waymond.

1416
01:47:06,219 --> 01:47:08,088
Don't say that.

1417
01:47:27,573 --> 01:47:29,909
Did you see that?

1418
01:47:32,144 --> 01:47:33,646
Ooh! Ooh-ooh! Ooh!

1419
01:47:33,679 --> 01:47:35,281
- Huh! Found it!
- Check this!

1420
01:47:35,314 --> 01:47:37,817
What song is this?

1421
01:47:40,887 --> 01:47:43,189
Thanks.
Thank you for coming.

1422
01:47:44,557 --> 01:47:46,092
That's very funny.

1423
01:47:46,926 --> 01:47:48,728
- Yeah, that's it?
- Yeah!

1424
01:48:48,087 --> 01:48:49,656
I'm sorry too.

1425
01:49:21,287 --> 01:49:23,189
Oh!

1426
01:49:24,590 --> 01:49:27,427
So cute!

1427
01:49:27,460 --> 01:49:29,529
Come on, Evelyn.

1428
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:32,032
Come on.

1429
01:49:35,768 --> 01:49:37,303
Oh.

1430
01:49:37,336 --> 01:49:39,272
I get it.

1431
01:49:42,441 --> 01:49:44,411
Feeling a good thing.

1432
01:49:45,645 --> 01:49:47,414
You got your hopes up.

1433
01:49:48,314 --> 01:49:50,850
So I'm here
to save you some time.

1434
01:49:53,653 --> 01:49:55,322
Eventually...

1435
01:49:58,524 --> 01:50:00,093
...that all just goes away.

1436
01:50:00,126 --> 01:50:02,261
..just goes away.

1437
01:50:02,294 --> 01:50:03,496
Come on.

1438
01:50:34,827 --> 01:50:37,730
I don't care
if you come with me.

1439
01:50:37,763 --> 01:50:39,532
Enjoy your life.

1440
01:50:56,916 --> 01:50:59,052
Ugh!

1441
01:50:59,085 --> 01:51:01,421
Evelyn! Evelyn, please!

1442
01:51:01,454 --> 01:51:03,189
No more!

1443
01:51:05,224 --> 01:51:07,193
I don't want to hurt you.

1444
01:51:13,933 --> 01:51:15,735
Joy, come back with me.

1445
01:51:15,768 --> 01:51:18,304
Joy! Joy!

1446
01:51:28,214 --> 01:51:32,018
What did my silly husband
say to you?

1447
01:51:33,419 --> 01:51:36,022
He told me about your situation.

1448
01:51:37,490 --> 01:51:40,793
I remembered when my husband
served me papers.

1449
01:51:40,826 --> 01:51:44,664
I drove his Kia Forte
through my neighbour's kitchen.

1450
01:51:44,697 --> 01:51:46,432
Huh!

1451
01:51:46,465 --> 01:51:48,267
But you know what I say?

1452
01:51:48,300 --> 01:51:52,739
It's called,
"Unlovable bitches like us...

1453
01:51:53,806 --> 01:51:56,309
"..make the world go 'round."

1454
01:52:04,083 --> 01:52:06,052
Don't stop playing.

1455
01:52:06,085 --> 01:52:08,388
Play something for me.

1456
01:52:23,469 --> 01:52:25,371
That's not true.

1457
01:52:28,574 --> 01:52:31,677
- You're not unlovable.
- You're not unlovable!

1458
01:52:31,710 --> 01:52:33,780
What are you talking about?

1459
01:52:33,813 --> 01:52:36,216
There is always
something to love.

1460
01:52:37,283 --> 01:52:40,086
Even in a stupid,
stupid universe

1461
01:52:40,119 --> 01:52:43,322
where we have
hot dogs for fingers,

1462
01:52:43,355 --> 01:52:45,691
we'd get very good
with our feet.

1463
01:53:03,576 --> 01:53:05,111
Oh!

1464
01:53:08,714 --> 01:53:10,917
- See?
- OK.

1465
01:53:10,950 --> 01:53:13,686
I feel nothing.

1466
01:53:13,719 --> 01:53:17,123
I... I feel...

1467
01:53:17,156 --> 01:53:19,025
I feel...

1468
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:33,472
Don't let her stop Jobu!

1469
01:53:33,505 --> 01:53:34,874
Open fire!

1470
01:54:29,795 --> 01:54:30,897
So stupid!

1471
01:54:47,913 --> 01:54:49,282
Evelyn?

1472
01:54:50,883 --> 01:54:52,251
What are you doing?

1473
01:54:52,284 --> 01:54:56,556
I'm learning to fight like you.

1474
01:55:38,097 --> 01:55:39,932
You know, Evelyn, my wife

1475
01:55:39,965 --> 01:55:41,834
used to wear
that exact same perfume,

1476
01:55:41,867 --> 01:55:43,469
God rest her soul.

1477
01:55:48,640 --> 01:55:50,443
These are
direct indications

1478
01:55:50,476 --> 01:55:52,878
that there's some impingement
of the nervous system.

1479
01:55:54,179 --> 01:55:55,457
With a little bit of help,

1480
01:55:55,481 --> 01:55:58,050
we could be seeing things
nice and straight.

1481
01:56:01,653 --> 01:56:03,289
You might feel
a little sore,

1482
01:56:03,322 --> 01:56:05,257
but everything
is looking pretty good.

1483
01:56:05,290 --> 01:56:07,527
Thank you.

1484
01:56:11,897 --> 01:56:13,666
Clean up in there, alright?

1485
01:56:23,042 --> 01:56:24,377
Hah!

1486
01:57:25,737 --> 01:57:28,074
You took everything
away from me.

1487
01:57:28,107 --> 01:57:29,776
I'm sorry.

1488
01:57:30,542 --> 01:57:33,379
Raccaccoonie
taught me so much!

1489
01:57:33,412 --> 01:57:35,781
I... I didn't even know

1490
01:57:35,814 --> 01:57:37,316
how to boil an egg

1491
01:57:37,349 --> 01:57:41,921
and he taught me
how to spin it on a spatula.

1492
01:57:43,489 --> 01:57:45,724
I'm useless alone.

1493
01:57:47,059 --> 01:57:49,495
We're all useless alone.

1494
01:57:49,528 --> 01:57:51,931
It's a good thing
you're not alone.

1495
01:57:52,898 --> 01:57:53,966
Oh!

1496
01:57:55,501 --> 01:57:57,837
Let's go rescue
your silly raccoon.

1497
01:57:59,538 --> 01:58:02,108
Oh, we're gonna do it!

1498
01:58:26,265 --> 01:58:29,268
Arggh!

1499
01:58:34,072 --> 01:58:36,308
Oh-ho-ho!

1500
01:58:51,823 --> 01:58:53,959
Get out of the way!

1501
01:59:09,675 --> 01:59:11,611
Waymond!

1502
01:59:22,854 --> 01:59:24,256
See?

1503
01:59:24,289 --> 01:59:25,858
It's only a matter of time

1504
01:59:25,891 --> 01:59:27,626
before everything
balances itself out.

1505
01:59:27,659 --> 01:59:29,528
- Come on, come on, come on!
- I can't.

1506
01:59:29,561 --> 01:59:32,331
I'm sorry, Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

1507
01:59:36,401 --> 01:59:39,138
Evelyn, let her go.

1508
02:00:21,513 --> 02:00:24,149
But she turned out
to be stubborn,

1509
02:00:24,182 --> 02:00:27,653
aimless, a mess.

1510
02:00:27,686 --> 02:00:29,589
Just like her mother.

1511
02:00:30,522 --> 02:00:32,491
But now I see.

1512
02:00:32,524 --> 02:00:35,094
It's OK that she's a mess.

1513
02:00:36,728 --> 02:00:39,398
Because just like me...

1514
02:00:39,431 --> 02:00:41,167
Huh.

1515
02:02:28,073 --> 02:02:30,275
Well, maybe you win
in this universe,

1516
02:02:30,308 --> 02:02:32,711
but in another time...

1517
02:02:36,681 --> 02:02:38,984
...I beat you!

1518
02:02:40,185 --> 02:02:41,353
Ohh!

1519
02:02:41,386 --> 02:02:43,188
Or we tie!

1520
02:02:47,859 --> 02:02:50,195
Or we just...

1521
02:02:50,228 --> 02:02:51,764
...hang around.

1522
02:02:51,797 --> 02:02:53,732
OK, Joy, listen.

1523
02:02:55,534 --> 02:02:56,902
Because it's all
just a pointless

1524
02:02:56,935 --> 02:02:58,504
swirling bucket of bullshit.

1525
02:02:58,537 --> 02:03:00,172
Huh!

1526
02:03:01,807 --> 02:03:05,778
That bagel is where
we finally find peace, Evelyn.

1527
02:03:08,914 --> 02:03:12,651
Stop calling me Evelyn!

1528
02:03:24,129 --> 02:03:25,364
I

1529
02:03:25,397 --> 02:03:27,933
Am

1530
02:03:27,966 --> 02:03:30,002
Your

1531
02:03:30,035 --> 02:03:31,771
mother!

1532
02:03:41,713 --> 02:03:43,149
Ah Ba?

1533
02:03:49,588 --> 02:03:51,323
Seriously?

1534
02:03:51,356 --> 02:03:53,592
Can you please just...

1535
02:03:53,625 --> 02:03:56,228
...stop?!

1536
02:03:58,630 --> 02:04:00,466
Mom.

1537
02:04:00,499 --> 02:04:02,935
Just... just stop.

1538
02:04:03,735 --> 02:04:06,372
Good for you.
You're figuring your shit out.

1539
02:04:07,806 --> 02:04:12,111
And that's great. I'm really,
really happy for you.

1540
02:04:13,411 --> 02:04:15,281
But I'm...

1541
02:04:16,548 --> 02:04:18,451
...I'm tired.

1542
02:04:20,619 --> 02:04:22,120
I don't want to hurt anymore.

1543
02:04:22,153 --> 02:04:24,890
And for some reason
when I'm with you, it just...

1544
02:04:26,925 --> 02:04:29,261
...it just hurts the both of us.

1545
02:04:32,864 --> 02:04:36,168
So let's just go
our separate ways, OK?

1546
02:04:37,736 --> 02:04:40,239
Just let me go.

1547
02:04:52,551 --> 02:04:54,186
OK.

1548
02:05:29,588 --> 02:05:31,257
Wait.

1549
02:05:38,296 --> 02:05:39,698
You are getting fat.

1550
02:05:39,731 --> 02:05:41,099
And you never call me

1551
02:05:41,132 --> 02:05:42,568
even though we have
a family plan.

1552
02:05:42,601 --> 02:05:44,202
- What?
- And it's free.

1553
02:05:44,235 --> 02:05:46,738
You only visit
when you need something.

1554
02:05:46,771 --> 02:05:48,941
And you got a tattoo
and I don't care

1555
02:05:48,974 --> 02:05:51,376
if it's supposed
to represent our family.

1556
02:05:51,409 --> 02:05:52,978
You know I hate tattoos.

1557
02:05:53,011 --> 02:05:55,747
And of all the places
I could be,

1558
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:58,216
why would I want
to be here with you?

1559
02:05:58,249 --> 02:06:00,452
Yes, you're right.

1560
02:06:00,485 --> 02:06:02,387
It doesn't make sense.

1561
02:06:02,420 --> 02:06:03,556
Evelyn!

1562
02:06:04,689 --> 02:06:06,392
Let her finish.

1563
02:06:08,827 --> 02:06:10,563
Maybe it's like you said.

1564
02:06:11,630 --> 02:06:14,266
Maybe there is
something out there,

1565
02:06:14,299 --> 02:06:16,001
some new discovery

1566
02:06:16,034 --> 02:06:17,603
that will make us feel

1567
02:06:17,636 --> 02:06:20,506
like even smaller
pieces of shit.

1568
02:06:21,640 --> 02:06:23,809
Something that explains why

1569
02:06:23,842 --> 02:06:26,812
you still went looking for me

1570
02:06:26,845 --> 02:06:29,315
through all of this noise.

1571
02:06:31,549 --> 02:06:33,218
And why,

1572
02:06:33,251 --> 02:06:35,253
no matter what,

1573
02:06:35,286 --> 02:06:37,957
I still want
to be here with you.

1574
02:06:39,691 --> 02:06:42,061
I will always...

1575
02:06:43,361 --> 02:06:44,964
...always...

1576
02:06:45,730 --> 02:06:48,467
...want to be here with you.

1577
02:06:50,869 --> 02:06:53,005
So what? You...

1578
02:06:55,940 --> 02:06:58,978
You're just gonna
ignore everything else?

1579
02:06:59,944 --> 02:07:03,115
You could be anything, anywhere.

1580
02:07:06,918 --> 02:07:10,022
Why not go somewhere
where your...

1581
02:07:12,857 --> 02:07:15,361
...where your daughter
is more than just...

1582
02:07:17,028 --> 02:07:18,931
...this?

1583
02:07:20,498 --> 02:07:22,801
Here, all we get

1584
02:07:22,834 --> 02:07:26,104
are a few specks of time

1585
02:07:26,137 --> 02:07:29,675
where any of this
actually makes any sense.

1586
02:07:35,447 --> 02:07:37,249
Then I will cherish

1587
02:07:37,282 --> 02:07:40,519
these few specks of time.

1588
02:07:48,126 --> 02:07:50,395
You push the button.

1589
02:07:50,428 --> 02:07:52,631
Yeah, there you go.

1590
02:07:52,664 --> 02:07:54,399
I feel like I'm 14.

1591
02:07:54,432 --> 02:07:56,601
Yeah.

1592
02:07:56,634 --> 02:07:59,905
You're a crazy woman!

1593
02:07:59,938 --> 02:08:01,673
Takes one to know one.

1594
02:08:01,706 --> 02:08:05,210
I'm sorry, Raccaccoonie!
I'm sorry!

1595
02:08:05,243 --> 02:08:07,613
- What are you doing?
- Grab my hair.

1596
02:08:21,659 --> 02:08:24,063
What did he say?

1597
02:09:36,668 --> 02:09:38,771
This is so awkward.

1598
02:09:40,872 --> 02:09:42,808
This is awkward, right?

1599
02:09:47,078 --> 02:09:49,581
Do you still want
to do your party?

1600
02:09:50,782 --> 02:09:53,485
We can do whatever we want.

1601
02:09:57,622 --> 02:09:59,124
Nothing matters.

1602
02:10:12,704 --> 02:10:15,674
OK, we're definitely
late now, guys.

1603
02:10:17,842 --> 02:10:19,544
Do you have to bring all these?

1604
02:10:19,577 --> 02:10:20,846
Mmm-hmm.

1605
02:10:20,879 --> 02:10:22,814
That needs to go in the bag too.

1606
02:10:22,847 --> 02:10:25,784
Taxes suck.

1607
02:10:34,893 --> 02:10:36,829
Thank you for the ride, Becky!

1608
02:10:37,829 --> 02:10:39,764
Hey, it's good.

1609
02:10:39,797 --> 02:10:41,199
Mmm-hmm. You got this, OK?

1610
02:10:41,232 --> 02:10:42,667
- Becky?
- I'll call you after.

1611
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:44,536
You need to grow your hair.

1612
02:10:48,206 --> 02:10:49,841
Wow.

1613
02:10:52,977 --> 02:10:54,946
I'll call you later!

1614
02:10:54,979 --> 02:10:56,648
Hurry, hurry!

1615
02:11:01,185 --> 02:11:02,888
I gotta pee. Hold on.

1616
02:11:02,921 --> 02:11:04,656
OK. Hurry.

1617
02:11:40,758 --> 02:11:43,194
OK. Yes.

1618
02:11:43,227 --> 02:11:46,631
I am happy to say I do think

1619
02:11:46,664 --> 02:11:47,966
things are better.

1620
02:11:47,999 --> 02:11:50,235
This is... this is
an improvement.

1621
02:11:50,268 --> 02:11:52,304
And I'm glad that you listened.

1622
02:11:52,337 --> 02:11:54,139
But we have a problem

1623
02:11:54,172 --> 02:11:56,441
because you listened,
but you didn't listen

1624
02:11:56,474 --> 02:11:58,310
and that has to do
with the Schedule C.

1625
02:11:58,343 --> 02:12:01,379
You see, you did...

1626
02:12:11,589 --> 02:12:13,959
Evelyn!
Did you hear me?

1627
02:12:13,992 --> 02:12:17,429
Sorry. What did you say?

1628
02:13:02,940 --> 02:13:07,245
