[parent] Welcome to our family.
We're the Bakers.

We're a big family full of big dreamers.

Right now, our dream is getting everyone
out of the house on time.

00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:23,083
[both] We got this.

43
00:02:23,166 --> 00:02:24,875
All right, I got the boys and the littles.

44
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:26,500
-Yeah, I'll get Dej.
-Okay.

45

[Paul] This is DJ.

00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:33,958
He dreams of being the world's greatest
Lego designer and comic book artist.

00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:35,041

[Paul] This is Haresh. He dreams
of being a player. It's not happening.

52
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,291
Last I checked, players don't sleep

What are you doin' here?

89
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,458
And more importantly,
why did we give you a key?

90
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,708
Is that any way to greet the pinch hitter
babysitter who's here to save the day?

91
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,458
And that's why we gave her a key.

00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,125
Namaste.

00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,166

Let's roll. Let's go. Let's go.

00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:38,458
Come on. Let's go!

108
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:42,458
[Paul] Okay. Two moms, one dad,
and a ragtag group of nine kids.

109
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,583
I know what you're thinking,
and no, we're not a cult.

110
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,916
But we're definitely different.

111
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,875
-No man left behind!
-Woo-hoo!

112
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,625
-Um, what about us?
-Yeah!

113
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,291
I'm sorry, all twins left behind.

114
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:55,958
-What?
-Aw!

115
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,166
-Hey!
-[Zoey] When we go to work,

116
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:01,083
the littles stay home with Kate, because
there are limits to child labor laws.

117
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,416
[Paul] Kate may not be
the most together babysitter,

118
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,833
but the kids love her.

119
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,208
And she's free.

120
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,125
You see, we run our own family restaurant,
Baker's Breakfast.

121
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,541
A mom and pop,

122
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,083
and daughter, and daughter,

123
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,125
and son, and son,

124
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,625
and daughter breakfast spot.

125
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,083
-Hey, Paul.
-Hey. That can go out.

126
00:05:20,166 --> 00:05:21,375
-Ah, cool, thanks.
-Thank you.

127
00:05:21,875 --> 00:05:24,291
[Paul] Okay.
First, I should explain how we got here.

128
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:29,000
Kate and I met in college when we were
cast as Sandy and Danny in Grease.

129
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:32,291
-[Kate shouts, laughs]
-We stayed in character onstage and off,

130
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,750
falling in love
and having a surprise ending…

131
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:36,083
-Whoa!
-[Kate screams]

132
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,041
[Paul]
…which was getting pregnant with Ella.

133
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,666
-[Paul groans]
-[Kate laughs]

134
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,958
Which is why I dropped outta college
and got a job in a crummy diner.

135
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,750
We were just getting by
when we got pregnant again…

136
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,125
-Maybe it's supposed to be the…
-[Paul] …with Harley.

137
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:54,666
And then, when our best friends
were killed by a drunk driver,

138
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:57,166
we adopted our godson, Haresh.

139
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:00,375
While there was nothing more exciting
than being parents,

140
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:03,875
Kate got a lot less excited
about being married to me.

141
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,833
We agreed to close that chapter
of our lives and start new ones.

142
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:12,791
I dreamed big and bought
that crummy diner, which is where I met…

143
00:06:12,875 --> 00:06:14,750
Two short stacks
and a Denver omelet, please.

144
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,875
Oh, and I have breakfast coupons.

145
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:22,291
-Um, I'm so sorry, but it's 11:16…
-[Zoey] Wow.

146
00:06:22,375 --> 00:06:26,000
…which means you're gonna have to order
off this glorious lunch menu.

147
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,250
Hi, Mommy.

148
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,458
[Zoey] Well, kids, let's go.

149
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:31,250
This unkind gentleman is trying
to force us

150
00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,541
to have hot soup and shepherd's pie
for breakfast.

151
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,250
Why? Were we bad?

152
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:38,583
Sir, please tell my adorable children

153
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:42,625
why they can't have delicious eggs
and fluffy flapjacks.

154
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,916
-Whoa.
-This is incredible.

155
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,166
Oh, thank you so much.
It's an apple-bacon crepe.

156
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,375
And it's amazing.

157
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,291
-I mean, but this sauce is fantastic.
-Really?

158
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:04,166
It's like, um, hot, uh, sweet, savory,
depending on what I put it on.

159
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,916
That's exactly what I was going for.

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,041
It's amazing. I mean,
you're, like, the Willy Wonka of sauces.

161
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:12,000
You know, minus the unpaid, exploited
Oompa-Loompa workforce, of course.

162
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,666
Clearly, you haven't looked in the kitchen
yet. This place runs on Loompa.

163
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,791
[chuckles]

164
00:07:16,875 --> 00:07:18,291
By the way, I'm sorry about earlier.

165
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:20,666
I know what it's like when kids
get their hearts set on breakfast.

166
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,500
I got three of my own.
And breakfast is their favorite meal.

167
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,000
By the way, that whole "we stop serving
breakfast at 11:00" thing,

168
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,083
that has to stop.

169
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:32,875
I need to be able to eat
this breakfast with that sauce 24-7.

170
00:07:32,958 --> 00:07:34,833
It's an interesting idea.
I'll run it by the owner.

171
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:37,166
-Yeah.
-Oh, wait! That's me. I love it.

172
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,208
[kids laugh]

173
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,541
So good.

174
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,958
You want some dessert, buddy?

175
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,541
A giant cupcake.

176
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,083
Giant cupcake it is. Be right back, Mom.

177
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:46,333
[Zoey laughs]

178
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,416
He's nice.

179
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,666
Uh, he all right.

180
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,125
I was newly divorced too.

181
00:07:52,208 --> 00:07:54,166
My ex, Dom, and I met at USC.

182
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,250
Hello, hello.

183
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:57,333
We were the perfect couple.
He was a football star,

184
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,291
and I was a cheerleader and valedictorian.

185
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,875
-Who you talking to?
-We got married right out of school,

186
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,750
and Deja and DJ followed soon after.

187
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:04,833
"…roller coaster."

188
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:07,291
Our family grew
as fast as Dom's football career.

189
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,833
At first, we did talk shows
and photoshoots together,

190
00:08:09,916 --> 00:08:14,291
but then he was always gone doing
endorsements and business ventures.

191
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,916
And our ideas of partnership changed.

192
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,458
So we agreed to close that chapter
of our lives and start new ones.

193
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,041
I traded four-star restaurants
for 24-hour diners.

194
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:27,375
I dusted off my marketing degree,
and we became business partners.

195
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:37,041
[Paul] Six months after that,
we turned our two families into one.

196
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,125
[applause, cheering]

197
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,416
And we made all our dreams come true.

198
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,500
A big, beautiful family,

199
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:46,208
a booming business,

200
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,458
-and around-the-clock breakfast.
-Can I tickle you?

201
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,000
Even our wedding cake was made of waffles.

202
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:55,625
There you go.

203
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:58,041
[Paul] We turned the diner into
an all-day breakfast spot.

204
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,958
We serve breakfast-breakfast…

205
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,125
[Zoey] Lunch-breakfast…

206
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,708
[Paul] And dinner-breakfast.

207
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,750
[Zoey] My pregnancy was planned.

208
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,833
-The outcome, however, was not.
-[groans]

209
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:12,083
Twins! Luna and Luca.

210
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,375
[Paul] Our life got a little chaotic.

211
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,625
And just when things were settling down,

212
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:20,041
it happened again with Bronx and Bailey,

213
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,250
bringing our one big, happy family to 11.

214
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:28,500
And as hectic as our life can get,
it always somehow feels just right.

215
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:34,416
Babe, this is wrong.
We're not a month behind on rent, right?

216
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,916
-Right?
-What? Us behind? That's crazy.

217
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:44,541
Okay, babe, babe, babe.
You're anxiety-chopping again.

218
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:46,625
Sorry.

219
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:51,541
Were you intentionally hiding this
from me?

220
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:54,541
It's just a month, Zoey.
I promise you it's not that big a deal.

221
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:57,833
I love this place as much as you do,
but it is draining us.

222
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:01,000
We can't make any moves
because we pour everything back into it.

223
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,916
What about our dream
of buying a bigger house?

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,666
It's gonna happen, baby. I promise.

225
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,958
Even Chef Boyardee started out
as a fry cook.

226
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:10,500
I just need a little more time
to figure everything out.

227
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:12,833
Are you trying to tell me
Chef Boyardee is a real person?

228
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,000
Oh, yeah.

229
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,708
You don't know about the Boyardee?
He was a legend.

230
00:10:16,791 --> 00:10:21,000
He actually catered
Woodrow Wilson's wedding in 1915.

231
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,166
He lived to 87.

232
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:24,708
He died rich and happy in Ohio.

233
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,958
It is so weird that you know this.

234
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,666
Keep dreaming.

235
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:43,083
-Can I help you find something?
-Oh, hi. Yeah.

236
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:47,833
I'm looking for a sauce
that could be hot, sweet or savory

237
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,125
depending on what you eat it with.

238
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:51,750
Wow, that sounds amazing.

239
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,291
-Right?
-Uh, what's it called?

240
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,750
I'm not sure yet.

241
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,375
Okay. When you figure it out, let me know.

242
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,791
[dog barking]

243
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,583
-Here you go.
-[hip-hop playing on headphones]

244
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,375
-Nice and cold…
-Oh!

245
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,916
…so you don't have to get up
and go to the kitchen,

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,500
-or the hallway…
-[chuckles]

247
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:15,625
…or really any other room for that matter.

248
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,791
You are so thoughtful. Thank you, baby.

249
00:11:18,291 --> 00:11:19,916
[music playing over headphones]

250
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You ever heard of TikTok? It's hilarious.

251
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,833
-Hi, Danny.
-Hi, Luna.

252
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,083
-Hey, Danny.
-Hi, Kate.

253
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,416
What are you guys playing?

254
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,000
Drag race.

255
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,125
Oh, fun! I love RuPaul.

256
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,958
[Luna] Who's betting?

257
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,916
-[child] I've got money. I got Bailey.
-[child 2] My money's on Bronx.

258
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,791
[children cheering]

259
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,041
Let's get this going.

260
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,458
This babysitter's not
gonna be checked out forever.

261
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,833
Coast is clear! Go time.

262
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,875
Ready? Go!

263
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,000
-Yeah!
-Yes!

264
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,791
[child] Go! Go! Go!

265
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,333
Go, Bronx! Go, Bailey!

266
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,125
Go, Danny!

267
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,458
[Bailey] He's gaining on us!

268
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:02,875
[Luca] Oh, no! Bottle!

269
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,958
[cheering continues]

270
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:06,375
[child] Go! Go!

271
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,250
-[shushes]
-[cheering continues]

272
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,333
Whoa.

273
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,916
-[Danny] Shortcut!
-[Bronx] No fair!

274
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,208
Whoa!

275
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:16,958
-Come on, Bailey!
-Go get 'em!

276
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,250
[all] Whoa.

277
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,166
[Luca] Uh-oh.

278
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,458
-What's wrong?
-Parents!

279
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:28,083
-Everybody out!
-I'll get the door.

280
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:30,625
[children scream]

281
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:33,208
-What is happening? Danny?
-[DJ] Whoa.

282
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
-[Danny] Go!
-Get lost!

283
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,333
[children scream]

284
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,708
-[Bailey] Yeah.
-[child laughs]

285
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,625
[imitates bike noise]

286
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,208
-[child] Retreat.
-[children clamoring]

287
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,875
-[Paul] Hey! Hey!
-[Bronx] Oh!

288
00:12:45,958 --> 00:12:47,375
-[Zoey] Oh!
-[children] Ooh!

289
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:49,625
-[Paul] Ow!
-Ooh! That's gotta hurt.

290
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,833
I'm fine.

291
00:12:52,416 --> 00:12:55,500
-Did you want some ice?
-Oh, no, no, no. We're okay.

292
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,083
Buddy, how many fingers am I holding up?

293
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,833
-Four.
-So he's back to normal.

294
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,416
Before you say anything,
it's not what it seems.

295
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,500
You weren't having a Fast and Furious
style race against Danny Chen for money?

296
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:10,750
Whoa. I just realized
we're not smarter than you.

297
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,083
You guys are so irresponsible.

298
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,916
I've been in bed the whole time.

299
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,666
Honey, you still have your helmet on.

300
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:19,416
This is my sleeping helmet.

301
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,500
[littles giggle]

302
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,208
Okay. All right. You two, out of here.
What am I gonna do with you two?

303
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:26,083
[laughs]

304
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,166
Go to your room.

305
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,750
But don't you wanna do our TikTok dance
with us, Daddy?

306
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,458
Yeah,
because we're so irresistibly adorable.

307
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:37,041
Don't try and charm me with our TikTok
dance. And you're not even doing it right.

308
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:39,541
You have to clap the back of the hands
and then throw.

309
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:41,833
You're an embarrassment to the family.
Go to your room.

310
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,708
We tried.

311
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:44,791
We always do.

312
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,250
So, uh, you think Bronx is okay?

313
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,375
Yeah. He hits his head on the hour.

314
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:58,208
Oh, good. Although,
I feel like this one is my fault.

315
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,458
-You think?
-Well, my new therapist says

316
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:02,583
I have issues with being a disciplinarian.

317
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,375
You have another new therapist?

318
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,250
But my new new therapist made me realize
I missed my old new therapist,

319
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:09,458
so it's out with the new, in with the old.

320
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,958
-That makes total sense.
-Yeah, I know, right?

321
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,416
Who's that?

322
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,666
Probably no one,
but if it's Danny Chen's parents,

323
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,500
we don't know him, and he wasn't here.

324
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,541
-Dom, hey.
-Hey.

325
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,791
How are you? What are you doing in town?

326
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:25,500
You know, just got back.
Thought I'd come by and see the kids.

327
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,666
I hope that's not a problem.

328
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,208
-Well--
-[Kate] No.

329
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:30,541
You're handsome and famous?
Come over anytime.

330
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,916
-Dad?
-Hey.

331
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
[Dom chuckles]

332
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,625
-[DJ] Oh. Hey, Dad.
-Hey, what's up, DJ?

333
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,541
-Hey, man.
-Hey, look. These are for you.

334
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,833
[chuckling] Oh, well, thanks.

335
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:43,625
-Dom!
-Hey, little man, what's happening?

336
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,541
-Yeah, well--
-How you doing, man? Look at you.

337
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,583
-Looking just as stylish as ever.
-You too.

338
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:48,916
Thank you, man.

339
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,916
-So, who wants headphones?
-[Luca] Me.

340
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,250
Beats headphones?

341
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:55,583
-Personalized Beats headphones.
-Wow.

342
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:57,250
You wanna help pass them out for me?

343
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,541
-Yeah!
-[chuckles] Thanks, buddy.

344
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,125
Thanks, Dad.

345
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,458
-You're welcome, baby.
-Wow.

346
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,791
Here, Daddy. Dom got you a pair too.

347
00:15:03,875 --> 00:15:05,666
Oh, wow. Thank you.

348
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,250
-What is this?
-Look what Dom brought everybody.

349
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:10,500
-[Zoey] Ooh. [chuckles]
-They're personalized.

350
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,583
Whoa.

351
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:15,166
-Way to stunt. Thanks, D.
-It's very nice of you, Dom. Thank you.

352
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,500
I'm guessing I didn't-- I didn't get one?

353
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,875
-Kate.
-Okay. Cool. Yeah. Cool.

354
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,416
I'm gonna go check on Bronx.

355
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:26,083
So, what do you think?

356
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,958
I mean,
they're Michael Jordan tennies, and--

357
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:31,458
Yeah, I guess these'll be fun.

358
00:15:31,541 --> 00:15:33,375
-Yeah, they're pretty dope, right?
-[DJ] Yeah.

359
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:35,041
So dope. They're very dope.

360
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,375
They look so expensive.
They probably cost more than--

361
00:15:38,458 --> 00:15:39,708
This house?

362
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,041
[Dom chuckles]

363
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:43,666
[chuckles] No, that's-- That-- Ow!

364
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:48,041
I was-- I was actually gonna say
five pairs of my sneakers,

365
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:50,875
but no, the home that I live in
is definitely funnier.

366
00:15:51,708 --> 00:15:53,125
They're so big.

367
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,000
Look at these things, babe, huh?

368
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:56,583
Beep. Beep. Beep.

369
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,708
Yeah, well, actually, Paul, he's a 12 now.

370
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:03,125
I don't know if you knew or not,
but, you know, big feet run in our family.

371
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,208
And what are you?
About, what, I'd say a 10?

372
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,500
-Dad.
-I was born with tiny toes, Dom.

373
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:14,375
It's not something I like to joke about,
but since you asked, 9 and 3/4.

374
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,083
Oh, Paul.

375
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:23,125
Baby, I love your little feet, and I love
that we can share the same shoes.

376
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:26,041
We don't share the same shoes.
I wore your UGGs once.

377
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,875
Hey, Paul, you mind tossing me a beer?

378
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,041
I'm sorry. We don't have any beer.

379
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:33,625
I can clearly see that you guys have beer.

380
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,750
-It's on-- It's on the door.
-You didn't. No.

381
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:38,458
-Paul, don't be like that.
-I'll tell you what I can get for you.

382
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:41,291
The one thing we have for you,

383
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,416
a tasty juice box.

384
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:47,000
Oh. Well, this is my favorite.
This is better.

385
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,083
And, uh…

386
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,416
interesting place to keep your oranges.

387
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,375
Yeah, it's for convenience.
They're everywhere.

388
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,208
You want an orange, you reach down.

389
00:16:57,958 --> 00:17:00,000
So, Dom, great to see you.

390
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:03,208
What-- What brings you to town?
Don't you have work?

391
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:06,291
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

392
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,750
No, I decided to retire.

393
00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:11,166
I'm considering
a year-long deal with ESPN.

394
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,875
Yeah, which means
more money, less tackling.

395
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:16,500
So I'm just checking out places to buy.

396
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,291
-So you're moving back to LA?
-[Dom] Mm-hmm.

397
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:21,125
-That'll be great for the kids.
-LA, LA? Like, here LA?

398
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,375
Like, where I live? With-- With my family?

399
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,958
Yeah. To be with my family.

400
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,416
I thought we were all family.

401
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,500
-We are.
-We are.

402
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,750
But that means I can be around more,

403
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,458
be part of the day-to-day
and help out with these guys.

404
00:17:35,541 --> 00:17:37,083
-Cool.
-No, no. I think we're good.

405
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:39,416
We don't need help. Do we, babe?
No. We're-- No.

406
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,166
We-- We're fine.
This place runs like a well-oiled machine.

407
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,000
Um, so he sneezed
and started bleeding again.

408
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:46,791
It tastes like metal.

409
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,708
-[Zoey] Okay, I'm coming.
-He's fine.

410
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:51,166
That one's not even yours, so don't worry.

411
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,666
Yay, Dom's moving back. More Dom.

412
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,791
-Paul.
-I know. It'll be great with the kids.

413
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:00,875
It's just-- It's definitely gonna be weird
having him around.

414
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,000
Unlike the totally normal way
that Kate's around all the time?

415
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:07,708
Babe, last week I caught her
trying on my bathing suits. Ew.

416
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,833
-Well, at least she helps with the kids.
-And Dom will too.

417
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,291
Now.

418
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,958
Come on, Zoey.
You know it's not the same thing.

419
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:20,291
Kate isn't richer
and, like, 10 feet taller than you.

420
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:22,875
Are you ever gonna stop being threatened
by all that stuff?

421
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:25,208
I am not threatened. I just-- Honestly?

422
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:29,916
I think it's sad that he feels the need to
make himself feel bigger by coming in here

423
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,958
and, like, showering us all
with these expensive headphones.

424
00:18:33,041 --> 00:18:36,166
Like, "We get it. You're an
ex-football player with giant feet

425
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:39,000
and a Japanese toilet
that washes your butt."

426
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,541
Not sure how you know about that.

427
00:18:40,625 --> 00:18:44,708
And for the record, I am very secure
in my size 9-and-1/2 Converse.

428
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,625
Mmm. I love it when you talk
sensible sneaker to me.

429
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:51,666
Well, what happens when I say Asics?

[sighs] I know.
I know I'm supposed to be asleep,

442
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,166
but I heard there's gonna be a scout
from SC at my game.

443
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:33,041
How bomb would it be
if I went to my dad's alma mater?

444
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,125
Would be bombish. Bomb--

445
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,875
Bomb-adjacent.
But you know what would be bombier?

446
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,166
If you went to my alma mater.

447
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,000
Chino Hills Culinary Arts?

448
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,750

449
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,958
Let me show you a little something, okay?

450
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,875
You're getting them in
but not as gloriously as I'd like you to.

451
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:56,541
All right, watch this. Ready?

452
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,541
Okay, so the goal
was to not get it in, right?

453
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,250
-Yeah, I had to warm up.
-Yep.

454
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,375
-Okay.
-I'm warm.

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Hi, everyone. I am so excited
to introduce you to Paul Baker.

673
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:11,958
Uh…

674
00:30:12,833 --> 00:30:14,458
Oh, hi, everyone. Um…

675
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:18,333
Thank you-- Thank you so much
for-- for inviting me and for--

676
00:30:19,125 --> 00:30:22,416
Let me just-- Sorry. Bit overdressed here.

677
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:26,666
[sighs]

678
00:30:33,541 --> 00:30:34,750
S… [clears throat]

679
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,458
Sauce.
I'm here to talk to you about sauce.

680
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,583
"A billion-dollar industry.

681
00:30:41,666 --> 00:30:44,541
Studies show that sales of sauce

682
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:49,541
have skyrocketed by more
than 150% since 2000--"

683
00:30:52,791 --> 00:30:53,791
Is something wrong?

684
00:30:57,416 --> 00:30:59,666
I'm so sorry. This is-- This isn't me.

685
00:31:01,875 --> 00:31:04,458
I'm just gonna do this a different way.
Um…

686
00:31:05,541 --> 00:31:09,041
I'm just gonna speak
to you honestly about it.

687
00:31:09,125 --> 00:31:11,833
I-- I'm a chef,
and I have a breakfast restaurant.

688
00:31:11,916 --> 00:31:14,166
And I invented this sauce.

689
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:18,291
And miraculously,
it is hot, sweet, and savory

690
00:31:18,375 --> 00:31:20,791
all at the same time,
depending on what you put it on.

691
00:31:20,875 --> 00:31:23,500
So you could put it on your waffles
and it would be sweet.

692
00:31:23,583 --> 00:31:28,875
You could put it on your… chimichangas
and it would be… you got it, savory.

693
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:32,583
-[DJ] Okay, so, what's 15 times ten?
-[Haresh] Why would I know this?

694
00:31:32,666 --> 00:31:35,375
How did you get an F
on your computer science quiz?

695
00:31:35,458 --> 00:31:36,958
Like, I just don't get it.

696
00:31:37,041 --> 00:31:39,916
Why? 'Cause all Indian people
are supposed to be geniuses?

697
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,500
Or all Black people can dance?

698
00:31:41,583 --> 00:31:43,208
-Well--
-We know that's not true.

699
00:31:43,291 --> 00:31:44,291
You know what?

700
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:47,333
Zoey, show these idiots
what a rhythmless Black person looks like.

701
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,375
Hey, family. I have incredible news.

702
00:31:49,458 --> 00:31:51,458
-Why're you wearing my sweatshirt?
-And my jeans?

703
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:53,500
-And my fanny pack?
-Are those my sneakers?

704
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,666
Yo, low-key, that outfit goes hard.

705
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:56,750
Thank you, son.

706
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,125
Look at this, my darling.

707
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,583
What is this-- Whoa.

708
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:03,000
That is the money to start
our brand new sauce company.

709
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:05,166
-You sold the pitch?
-Well, no.

710
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:09,375
I mean, a full half of the investors said
they had "no faith in this whatsoever,"

711
00:32:09,458 --> 00:32:11,666
but Melanie and Michele
think it has promise.

712
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:14,166
So they gave me that check
to get things going.

713
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:17,583
-Whoa, we're rich. We're rich.
-Wow! Wow.

714
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:19,708
-[Paul chuckles]
-[laughs]

715
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,875
Wait, so they gave you all of this
just for seed money?

716
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:23,958
No, it's not just seed money.
It's also a signing bonus

717
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,000
and a buyout of the company name
and all future rights to the brand, but--

718
00:32:27,083 --> 00:32:28,750
Cool, so we're rich and sellouts?

719
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:31,833
No, we're not rich or sellouts.
This is how you grow a business.

720
00:32:31,916 --> 00:32:34,458
But we are the brand.

721
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:38,791
The company name is literally our name,
so how does that work?

722
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,750
If we're gonna be changing names, I want
the "S" in "Haresh" to be a dollar sign.

723
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:43,833
We're not changing our names, okay?

724
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:46,125
This is just gonna help us
pay off a whole lot of bills

725
00:32:46,208 --> 00:32:49,208
and, hopefully, get a house
with a working dryer.

726
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,416
Yes!

727
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:54,125
If Mom agrees, there are some in Calabasas
that are looking quite delicious.

728
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:57,625
-What?
-Calabasas? Bieber country?

729
00:32:57,708 --> 00:32:59,208
Am I gonna be a Real Housewife?

730
00:32:59,291 --> 00:33:02,291
No, it's not Bieber-Housewives level,
but I found this gated community

731
00:33:02,375 --> 00:33:04,666
which has a really big house
with bedrooms for everyone.

732
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,916
So we all get our own rooms?

733
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,916
-Yay!
-Yay!

734
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,541
Twins still have to share…

735
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,666
Boo!

736
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,208
…but there's a really amazing pool club.

737
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:16,208
-Yay!
-Yay!

738
00:33:16,291 --> 00:33:17,458
-Yes!
-[Paul laughs]

739
00:33:17,541 --> 00:33:19,083
-What about school?
-That's the thing.

740
00:33:19,166 --> 00:33:21,458
I think we could also afford
to send you to private school.

741
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:23,708
-You'd have college prep, smaller classes.
-Yo!

742
00:33:23,791 --> 00:33:26,125
Does it look like I'm college material?

743
00:33:26,208 --> 00:33:29,125
Dude, I'm fine being a disgrace.
I just don't wanna leave my friends.

744
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,041
What about my scholarship to USC?

745
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,958
Deja, the season just started.

746
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:36,000
I think if your mom
and I decide to do this,

747
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:37,666
you'll get on another great team.

748
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:41,000
I don't wanna be on another team.
Another team is wack.

749
00:33:41,083 --> 00:33:43,291
-This whole situation is wack.
-Preach!

750
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:48,250
Deja, just chill, okay?
Nothing has been decided.

751
00:33:48,958 --> 00:33:49,958
So--

752
00:33:50,041 --> 00:33:53,708
Just keep an open mind.
This could be great for our family.

753
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:02,083
What about you? You think this is wack?

754
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,000
Just please take off my fanny pack.

755
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:13,625
So she locked herself in her room,
and she's not even talking to me.

756
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,708
She'll get over it.

757
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,416
The important thing is that you and I
are on the same page.

758
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,083
Oh, we're not.

759
00:34:19,166 --> 00:34:22,125
-This is a bad idea.
-What are you talking about?

760
00:34:22,208 --> 00:34:23,958
You just said you thought
it could be great.

761
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,458
Because it's important to show
the kids we're a united front.

762
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:28,041
But no, this is crazy.

763
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:31,041
We need to use all of that money
to launch the sauce, not buy a house too.

764
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:34,375
Okay, just listen to me, baby, okay?
I've been crunching numbers,

765
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,708
and I think with the signing bonus,
we can afford a down payment.

766
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:39,083
It's too risky.

767
00:34:39,166 --> 00:34:42,375
If anything goes wrong, we won't be able
to afford a bigger mortgage.

768
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:46,333
And seriously? Calabasas?
Is Calabasas really us?

769
00:34:46,416 --> 00:34:48,000
I know. It's not ideal,

770
00:34:48,083 --> 00:34:51,041
but it's the only place we can afford
a big enough house.

771
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:53,958
We have been begging
for more room forever.

772
00:34:54,041 --> 00:34:55,750
You said it yourself today.

773
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,958
True.

774
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,041
Please trust me.

775
00:35:00,708 --> 00:35:03,125
I'm finally, finally in a position

776
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,916
where I can give the kids
something they really need.

777
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,458
And not dumb things,
like fancy headphones and flashy sneakers.

778
00:35:10,541 --> 00:35:14,958
I wanna give my wife a walk-in closet.

779
00:35:15,916 --> 00:35:18,125
Thank you. I appreciate that.

780
00:35:18,791 --> 00:35:22,291
But your wife already had a walk-in closet
that she walked away from.

781
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:28,333
What I'm hearing is that
you want a walk-in closet.

782
00:35:30,708 --> 00:35:31,708
I really do.

783
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:33,541
I see that.

00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,666
-This is all ours, Joe.
-[Luca] We're home!

838
00:37:58,166 --> 00:38:00,916
-Oh, hi, new neighbors. We're the Bakers.
-Hi.

839
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,625
Come over anytime.
We've got extra pool noodles.

840
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,000
Hello, ma'am. Welcome.

841
00:38:08,083 --> 00:38:09,250
Oh, thank you. Hi.

842
00:38:09,333 --> 00:38:12,583
Just so you know, we have
a strict neighborhood noise policy.

843
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,500
No loud music after 10:00.

844
00:38:15,708 --> 00:38:16,708
Okay.

845
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,250
Uh, question for you.

846
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:23,166
Do you always immediately tell
all new homeowners about this policy?

847
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,708
Or just us?

848
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,083
Seconds after we arrive.

849
00:38:28,041 --> 00:38:29,375
Is everything okay?

850
00:38:29,458 --> 00:38:31,125
Yes, sir. Um…

851
00:38:32,125 --> 00:38:33,791
Didn't mean to cause any offense.

852
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:35,958
Probably shouldn't have said
anything offensive.

853
00:38:37,833 --> 00:38:39,166
My apologies, ma'am.

854
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:40,833
You folks enjoy your day.

855
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,791
Well, that was fun for me.

856
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:56,250
What is all this?

857
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,416
It's our first night in the big place.
I thought we should celebrate.

858
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:02,833
How about some Flamin' Hot Cheetos
and Cîroc?

859
00:39:02,916 --> 00:39:04,666
[screams] Look what I got you. Hold on.

860
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:08,791
French vanilla Cîroc.

861
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:11,208
I thought they discontinued
French vanilla.

862
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,875
Like that would ever stop me.

863
00:39:13,708 --> 00:39:15,250
Oh, this calls for lingerie.

864
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:18,041
Okay. You know the one I love, baby.
You know that one.

865
00:39:22,791 --> 00:39:24,958
-Mmm. Cake.

866
00:39:25,041 --> 00:39:26,000
Whoa.

867
00:39:26,083 --> 00:39:28,375
-No, no. What are you guys doing?
-[Luca] We're scared.

868
00:39:28,458 --> 00:39:31,208
Um, we called for you,
but you couldn't hear us.

869
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,833
No, please take the dog off the bed.

870
00:39:32,916 --> 00:39:34,416
-No, no, please--
-Cheetos!

871
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,583
No, these are not for you,
and this is not for you.

872
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,958
-[Luna] This looks nice.
-Rose petals!

873
00:39:38,041 --> 00:39:39,250
No, please leave the rose petals--

874
00:39:39,333 --> 00:39:42,166
-Our tummies hurt.
-How could both of your tummies hurt?

875
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,333
We're twins, Dad.
You know how this kind of thing goes.

876
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,500
-[Luca] Come on! Come in!
-No, we're not all staying in here--

877
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,916
[Bronx] Rose petals!

878
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,083
Oh, hey, guys.

879
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:50,625
-Come on. It's your man.
-Hey, DJ!

880
00:39:50,708 --> 00:39:51,625
Just gonna take this.

881
00:39:51,708 --> 00:39:53,500
-You came just in time to leave.
-Rose petals! Rose!

882
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:54,583
-Thank you.
-Anyways,

883
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:56,125
I'm gonna need the wireless password,

884
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:59,500
but not so I can search for college girls
being free with their bodies.

885
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,541
No, that's why I didn't give you
the Wi-Fi password.

886
00:40:01,625 --> 00:40:03,000
Dude! The password.

887
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:05,166
-No. No Wi-Fi for both of you.
-Please, come on!

888
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,416
Yo, family movie night.

889
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,333
-No, it's not family movie night.
-[littles] Yeah!

890
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:11,000
-No. Everybody, please--
-What's going on?

891
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,250
Are you seriously having
a family movie night without me?

892
00:40:13,333 --> 00:40:14,541
-No!
-Yes!

893
00:40:14,625 --> 00:40:16,250
-No, everybody out.
-Pardon my butt.

894
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:18,791
Where do you think you're going?
Get off of me! Okay.

00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:20,666
-[Bark Obama barking]
-Okay, no. Bark.

896
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:24,541
Bark! No! Bark, give me-- Come on! Bark!

897
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,291

-She bought these for me!
-Don't lie!

902
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,666
-Don't lie!
-[Paul] These are from her.

903
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,458
[father on TV] Did I ever tell you about
the night your mother and I were married

904
00:40:40,541 --> 00:40:42,708
and we decided to have
an even dozen like you?

905
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:46,208

you even made a memorandum of it.

Eh?

914
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:24,333
What are you looking at?

915
00:41:24,416 --> 00:41:26,375
[Paul] It's so beautiful, baby.
You wanna get in?

916
00:41:26,458 --> 00:41:29,000
Not right now. I'm a little uncomfortable.

917
00:41:29,083 --> 00:41:31,833
I mean, look around. Everyone is staring
at us like we're weird.

918
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:33,958
Of course they're staring at us.
We are weird, babe.

919
00:41:34,041 --> 00:41:35,791
Look at our kids. Our kids are weirdos.

I just feel like we don't belong here.

929
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:55,583
Of course we belong here.

930
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:58,083
You belong here. You belong everywhere.

-and automatically belong.
-Well, I don't feel that way.

-Really?
-Yeah.

Name one time in your life
you didn't belong.

Really? Okay, um,
how about when your father took me

00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:17,708
to that barbershop in Inglewood
and they gave me a Jheri curl?

940
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:21,166
O-Okay. How about
when we went to your mom's church

941
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:22,875
and everyone stared at me the entire time?

942
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,958
Yeah, 'cause you were flailing around

Okay, fine.

A few times in your life,
you felt like you didn't belong.

I feel that way all the time.

to the neighborhood.

956
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:02,541
Normally, I'd have a welcome gift,
but I figured I'd just say, "Hi."

00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:04,541
So, hi. I'm Tricia.

-Okay.

Oh, wow. You are so brave

961
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:16,208
to let your kids invite so many
of their friends over. Two is my limit.

962
00:43:16,291 --> 00:43:19,166
Oh, no. Actually, they're all ours.

963
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:21,708
Oh. Okay.

964
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:25,375
Well, I actually have three, so I know
what it's like to have my hands full.

without seeing three of my kids.

-What happened?
-Your sister's in rehab again.

Why are we having
an emergency family meeting?

for a little while

And in the meantime, guess what?

978
00:43:57,541 --> 00:43:59,583
Cousin Seth is coming to live with us!

00:44:05,666 --> 00:44:08,125
-This is a whole house.
-It's not a debate, guys.

983
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:12,333
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Family has each other's back, okay?

984
00:44:12,416 --> 00:44:13,666
So tomorrow, when he gets here,

985
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:17,166

like family. You got it?

-Got it.
-Got it.

-I don't know. Doing their own thing.

But we told you guys that Seth was coming.

1001
00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:56,541
Yeah, and you also said
to treat him like family, so…

1002

Resh, maybe you could show Seth your room,

1003

All right. This is where you'll be staying
while you do your time here.

Nah.

1014

Nah, uh-uh. Nah, playboy.
Newcomers don't get the top bunk.

There's a hierarchy here.
They serve us dinner around 7:00.

1016
00:45:32,916 --> 00:45:36,916
We work in the kitchen on weekends.
You get your exercise outside on the yard.

While you're here, I suggest you link up
with a crew for protection.

You don't wanna get mixed up with them.

Have you been watching Locked Up again?

There may or may not have been
a 48-hour marathon on MSNBC.

Hey, bud.
I made you a little breakfast-lunch.

1034
00:46:28,208 --> 00:46:29,208
I'm not really hungry.

1035
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,166
Okay, well, I'll just put it right here.

1036
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,458
In case you change your mind.

1037
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:41,958
Look, I-I know how hard it can be
to adjust to a new environment.

1038
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:45,333
I want you to feel like this is home.

1039
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:48,458
I have a home. It's back
in my old neighborhood with my homeys.

Yeah. Yeah, I know,

1041

and-- and I'm sure those are--
those are really great guys.

1042
00:46:53,166 --> 00:46:57,500
But I made a promise to my sister
that I would look out for you.

1043
00:46:58,958 --> 00:47:01,916
But I'm here
if you ever wanna talk about anything.

1044
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:05,000
All right.

1045
00:47:05,083 --> 00:47:06,208
I'll leave you alone.

1050

We can't crawl in your bed
or hear you through the walls anymore.

Which means you won't grow up
to be freaky men with weird issues.

-No, no, no.

all your problems go away.

Please.

00:52:42,625 --> 00:52:44,791
Yeah. Definitely not napping in your bed.

1170
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:47,583
Oh, Lord. Give me strength. [inhales]

1171
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:05,791
-Hi.
-Hi.

1172
00:53:05,875 --> 00:53:08,875
Good morning. Paul, babe. Look who's here.

1173
00:53:08,958 --> 00:53:11,416
-Oh, hey, guys.
-[both] Hi.

1174
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,083
What brings you by? Let me guess.

1175
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:15,916
You want some lunch-breakfast.
Egg white enchiladas.

1176
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,875
Actually, we're here to talk sauce.

1177
00:53:18,958 --> 00:53:22,250
Well, that's my favorite subject.
Come on. I've got an open booth.

1178
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:25,208
-Join us?
-Uh…

1179
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:26,333
I got you.

1180
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:27,625
Thanks, Deej.

1181
00:53:29,041 --> 00:53:30,041
[patron] Hi.

1182
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:31,666
Oh, hello! Welcome to Baker's.

1183
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:33,333
And yes, I am a child.

1184
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,583
What's going on?

1185
00:53:35,666 --> 00:53:37,583
So, we've been doing some research,

1186
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:40,083
and we're seeing
that in the past few months,

1187
00:53:40,166 --> 00:53:42,500
your sauce has been flying
off the shelves.

1188
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,291
Sales have doubled in the past week alone.

1189
00:53:44,375 --> 00:53:45,916
-Doubled.
-Yeah, we've been doing okay.

1190
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,333
[Michele] No, it's more than okay.

1191
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:50,083
We're thinking what you could do
with some real money behind you.

1192
00:53:50,166 --> 00:53:52,291
So, what exactly are you proposing?

1193
00:53:52,375 --> 00:53:54,583
We're proposing an expansion.

1194
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:57,666
We wanna take your restaurant
and make it bigger than IHOP.

1195
00:53:57,750 --> 00:54:00,666
We wanna turn Baker's into a franchise.

1196
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,041
Oh, wow.

1197
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:05,541
Wow.

1198
00:54:05,625 --> 00:54:06,833
[Paul] I got goose bumps.

1199
00:54:06,916 --> 00:54:08,916
Yeah. I got something too.

1200
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:11,666
[both] Bye.

1201
00:54:11,750 --> 00:54:14,041
-Bye.
-All right, ladies. Drive safe.

1202
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,833
What do you think?

1203
00:54:17,916 --> 00:54:21,458
I think the idea sounds very exciting.

1204
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:23,875
I'm not sure why we need to do it though.

1205
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,375
I mean, the sauce is doing so well,
we bought the house--

1206
00:54:26,458 --> 00:54:27,875
But this is just the beginning.

1207
00:54:27,958 --> 00:54:30,208
This could be everything
we've ever dreamt of.

1208
00:54:30,291 --> 00:54:31,500
I don't know.

1209
00:54:31,583 --> 00:54:33,041
-Bye. Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

1210
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,250
What do we even know
about starting a franchise?

1211
00:54:35,333 --> 00:54:37,500
Nothing. But what did I know
about starting a restaurant?

1212
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:40,583
This is different.
I mean, it would be a huge change.

1213
00:54:40,666 --> 00:54:42,291
-Change is good.
-Is it?

1214
00:54:42,375 --> 00:54:43,791
-Hi, welcome to Baker's.
-[both] Hey.

1215
00:54:44,625 --> 00:54:48,458
When Dom got drafted to the league,
he promised me that nothing would change.

1216
00:54:48,541 --> 00:54:51,875
But it did. I mean, I knew
he would be on the road a lot.

1217
00:54:51,958 --> 00:54:54,208
But then he started saying "yes"
to everything.

1218
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,541
And then, between the endorsements,
and the appearances,

1219
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:57,958
it was like he was never home.

1220
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,250
And when he was home,
he was too tired to be present.

1221
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,875
Look, I know I can make this work.

1222
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:04,708
But I won't do it
without your full support.

1223
00:55:04,791 --> 00:55:07,208
Us being on the same page
means everything to me.

1224
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,166
[Zoey sighs]

1225
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:15,416

00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:27,500

[exhales] Okay, well,

-you know I'm turning 14 in a few months…
-Yeah.

1277
00:57:27,333 --> 00:57:31,166
-…and I don't know anything about girls.
-Mmm.

1278
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,208
So I was wondering if you and me

1279
00:57:33,291 --> 00:57:35,333
could talk about
everything there is to know.

1280
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,000
Um, I think that this might be

1281
00:57:38,083 --> 00:57:40,333
a better conversation
for you to have with your dad.

1282
00:57:40,416 --> 00:57:43,958
No way. Me and my dad,
we have nothing in common.

1283
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:47,833
I feel like you and I,
we connect on a much deeper level.

Aw, DJ. That is so sweet.

1285

I mean, he's this super successful,
handsome athlete

1286

who can basically do everything.

1287
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:56,708
-You're the complete opposite.
-Oh.

1288
00:57:56,791 --> 00:58:01,250
You're an ordinary guy like me
with average looks and ordinary body.

1289
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:04,125
Wow. Okay,
that's starting to be a-a little hurtful.

-Well, there's this girl, Talia.
-Mmm.

She's really pretty.

1292
00:58:10,041 --> 00:58:11,500
Okay, um, let me think.

1293
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:14,875
Um, the best way to get in good
with a girl, I think,

1294
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,041
is to find out what she likes

1295
00:58:17,125 --> 00:58:20,875
and kind of use that as an icebreaker
to get your foot in the door.

1296
00:58:20,958 --> 00:58:22,416
Yeah, that makes sense.

1297
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,541

so average and relatable, Paul.

So?

1302
00:58:35,291 --> 00:58:37,500
It's pathetic. So transparent.

1303
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:38,625
What do you mean?

1304
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,833
It's the classic trust-building move.

1305
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:45,125
He's giving Seth more responsibility
so Seth will feel more secure, less angry,

1306
00:58:45,208 --> 00:58:48,708
and less likely to stab us in our sleep.

a little help now if you need it.

01:00:32,250 --> 01:00:33,416
-I love you.
-Bye.

1335
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:36,083
-Morning, sir.
-Good morning.

1336
01:00:36,166 --> 01:00:38,250
-[both laughing]
-Got you.

1337
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,500
Oh, whoa. Where do you two think
you're going with those?

1338
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,666
-You said we had a playdate.
-You can't bring those to our playdate.

1339
01:00:43,750 --> 01:00:45,541
But they're just toys.

1340
01:00:45,625 --> 01:00:50,125
That you convinced us to buy,
then taught us how to shoot.

1341
01:00:50,208 --> 01:00:55,541
Yes, admittedly, they are hours of fun,
but those are only for inside the house.

1342
01:00:55,625 --> 01:00:59,208
Okay? Never outside.
All right? It's not safe.

1343
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:02,083
But chin up.

1344
01:01:02,166 --> 01:01:05,166
Because there's so many other fun things
to do over there. I promise.

1345
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,541
-[child 1] Die! Die!
-[child 2] I got you!

1346
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:10,000
Guys,
there's so many other fun ways to play.

1347
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:12,791
Please, just let us feel our feelings.

1348
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:13,875
[Bronx] Yeah.

1349
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:17,541
-[child laughing]
-Okay. Okay.

1350
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:21,041
["Sunflower" playing]

1351
01:01:21,125 --> 01:01:23,500
-Oh, my kids are so over me.
-Mmm.

1352
01:01:24,291 --> 01:01:26,208
Oh. Mine were never into me.

1353
01:01:27,833 --> 01:01:29,958
-Hi, Anne.
-Hi, Trish.

1354
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,083
Oh, wow.

1355
01:01:33,166 --> 01:01:35,375
Oh, those kids are so cute.

1356
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:36,750
Oh, thank you.

1357
01:01:36,833 --> 01:01:38,750
And how long have you been the nanny for?

1358
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:42,833
Anne… [clears throat]
…this is Zoey. [chuckles]

1359
01:01:42,916 --> 01:01:44,500
She's the new mom in the group.

1360
01:01:44,583 --> 01:01:45,750
-Oh…
-Surprise!

1361
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,916
[sighs] Oh, I did it again.

1362
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:50,250
Oh, "again."

1363
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,583
I am so sorry. Oh, my goodness.

1364
01:01:52,666 --> 01:01:57,083
I had absolutely no idea.
Never seen you in any of the mom groups.

1365
01:01:57,166 --> 01:02:00,791
No, it's-- it's fine. It's fine.
You know what? It's an honest mistake.

1366
01:02:00,875 --> 01:02:03,083
Well, I'm Anne Vaughn. Hi, Zo.

1367
01:02:03,625 --> 01:02:04,625
"Ey." Yep.

1368
01:02:04,708 --> 01:02:07,833
Nice to meet you. And I also adopted.

1369
01:02:09,458 --> 01:02:11,541
Those are my children. Ming and Kenny.

1370
01:02:13,083 --> 01:02:14,583
Okay. Okay.

1371
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:17,833
Well, I am Zoey.

1372
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:23,125
And those are my biracial children, uh,
Bronx and Bailey,

1373
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:25,750
-that I conceived with my husband…
-[Tricia chuckles]

1374
01:02:25,833 --> 01:02:30,416
…and then I birthed them
through my very own personal uterus.

1375
01:02:31,208 --> 01:02:33,500
Okay, I could use some wine, Trish.

1376
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:34,833
[Anne laughs]

1377
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:38,375
-Listen, I don't wanna make this awkward…
-[Tricia] Yeah, we all could.

1378
01:02:38,458 --> 01:02:40,166
…but it's just so frustrating.

1379
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,958
People have so many preconceived notions
about my kids.

1380
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:46,791
That, like, they're not mine
or there's too many of them…

1381
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:48,625
-[dog barking]
-…or they're too wild!

1382
01:02:48,708 --> 01:02:51,458
-[Bark Obama barking]
-[Baker children] Mom! Mom!

1383
01:02:51,541 --> 01:02:53,750
Was that a stray rottweiler
running down the bike path?

1384
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:55,458
[chattering, shouting]

1385
01:02:55,541 --> 01:02:57,875
What is going on? Whose kids are those?

1386
01:02:57,958 --> 01:03:00,666
Uh… [stammers]
Look at the time. It's wine o' clock.

1387
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,791
Wait! [groaning]

1388
01:03:03,875 --> 01:03:06,583
Y'all know these espadrilles
weren't made for running!

1389
01:03:06,666 --> 01:03:07,666
Come on!

1390
01:03:17,833 --> 01:03:19,791
Hi, I'm Chef Baker.

1391
01:03:22,208 --> 01:03:24,166
[crowd cheering, clapping]

1392
01:03:25,125 --> 01:03:27,125
[spectator 1] Let's go, Hornets!

1393
01:03:27,208 --> 01:03:28,625
[spectator 2] Come on, defense!

1394
01:03:31,166 --> 01:03:32,916
-[crowd cheering]
-[whistle blows]

1395
01:03:34,083 --> 01:03:35,916
Mommy, when's Deja gonna play?

1396
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,333
I don't know, sweetie.

1397
01:03:41,333 --> 01:03:44,333
-Hey, what's up, guys?
-[littles] Chris! Chris! Chris!

1398
01:03:45,666 --> 01:03:47,500
-Hey, Mrs. Baker.
-How you doing?

1399
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,166
Mr. Clayton. Wow.
You're here cheering on Deja too?

1400
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:52,541
-Sure are.
-Nice to meet you.

1401
01:03:54,208 --> 01:03:55,208
"Too"?

1402
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,166
Who the hell is that?

1403
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:59,541
Well, I mean,
it's definitely not Deja's boyfriend

1404
01:03:59,625 --> 01:04:01,500
who we're not supposed
to be telling you about.

1405
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,125
-[crowd cheering]
-[buzzer sounds]

1406
01:04:08,875 --> 01:04:10,041
Dom, he's putting her in.

1407
01:04:10,125 --> 01:04:11,583
Hey! Here we go, Deja!

1408
01:04:11,666 --> 01:04:13,958
Come on, baby! Come on, Dej!

1409
01:04:14,541 --> 01:04:16,125
Not you, Clayton. Baron, you're in.

1410
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:18,666
I'm sorry.

1411
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,208
What?

1412
01:04:22,291 --> 01:04:26,083
Baron? Look, I've seen her in practice,
and she's a garbage player.

1413
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:29,416
I mean, who would pick a Baron
when you got a Clayton?

1414
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,041
Well, I hope USC gives out scholarships
for riding the bench.

1415
01:04:41,375 --> 01:04:43,416
Whoa. Whoa. Where you guys going?

1416
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:44,791
We're scared.

1417
01:04:44,875 --> 01:04:46,708
There's a monster under our bed.

1418
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:49,000
Have you tried monster spray?

1419
01:04:49,083 --> 01:04:50,750
What's monster spray?

1420
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:53,250
-You've never heard of monster spray?
-No.

1421
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:56,291
It works every time. Come on.
I'll show you how to make it.

1422
01:04:56,375 --> 01:05:00,583
Does it make their eyes pop out
and blood spurt everywhere?

1423
01:05:02,833 --> 01:05:05,375
Sure. Blood. Guts. Everything.

1424
01:05:05,458 --> 01:05:06,583
[both] Cool.

1425
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,791
Hey! How's Deja doing?

1426
01:05:14,041 --> 01:05:16,500
You know, ego's a little bruised,
but she'll live.

1427
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:18,166
Why won't she talk to me?

1428
01:05:19,291 --> 01:05:22,416
Because she's a moody teenage girl
and you're her annoying mom.

1429
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,250
Mom is the one who bandages her boo-boos

1430
01:05:25,333 --> 01:05:27,041
and was in the trenches with her
every day.

1431
01:05:27,125 --> 01:05:28,958
Yeah, but Mom's not the athlete.

1432
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:32,375
Mom doesn't know what it's like to put
her blood, sweat and tears onto the court,

1433
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:35,083
and walk away with nothing
but aching muscles and a broken heart.

1434
01:05:35,166 --> 01:05:36,791
Let Daddy have this one.

1435
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:42,041
Okay.

1436
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:46,791
Oh, and you don't have to call yourself
"Daddy" when there's no kids around.

1437
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,000
Oh.

1438
01:05:48,083 --> 01:05:50,125
Got it. Got it. Daddy hears that.

1439
01:05:53,583 --> 01:05:55,375
So, what do you think?

1440
01:05:55,458 --> 01:05:57,333
I mean, I guess it could work,

1441
01:05:57,416 --> 01:06:01,875
but only if we take what's here
and, like, rip it all out and burn it.

1442
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,625
-Sounds like we should keep looking.
-Yeah.

1443
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:07,125
In the meantime, let's talk menus.

1444
01:06:07,208 --> 01:06:10,375
Yes! By the way, Zoey made a list
of all these local vendors.

1445
01:06:10,458 --> 01:06:11,791
-Local?
-Yeah.

1446
01:06:11,875 --> 01:06:15,333
The customers love it and it's awesome
for the organic farm community.

1447
01:06:15,416 --> 01:06:17,250
Look, we love organic farmers.

1448
01:06:17,333 --> 01:06:19,166
-They're a fun bunch.
-Yeah, so fun!

1449
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,791
But we like to use larger wholesalers
to cut costs.

1450
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,083
So many costs.

1451
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:27,125
-Wait, really?
-But, with that said, let's get into it.

1452
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:29,416
Yeah!
If it makes sense, we'll totally do it.

1453
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:32,083
Okay, great. Should we get out of here?

1454
01:06:32,166 --> 01:06:33,708
-[Michele] Yeah!
-Smells like sadness.

1455
01:06:33,791 --> 01:06:35,708
-Okay. We got you.
-And mouse poop.

1456
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:41,791
Zo, I still can't believe
you have ten kids and no nanny.

1457
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:45,041
Wait. You have ten kids? Consensually?

1458
01:06:45,125 --> 01:06:47,541
Well, technically, they're not all mine.

1459
01:06:47,625 --> 01:06:50,333
You know,
three are from Paul's first marriage.

1460
01:06:50,416 --> 01:06:53,916
And then we took in our nephew
who was getting into some bad stuff.

1461
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:56,166
You know, fighting, and gangs and…

1462
01:06:56,250 --> 01:06:58,250
Oh, no. That's awful.

1463
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:03,666
And you're bringing him here to this safe,
equity-growing, gated community.

1464
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,458
I mean, it's so thoughtful of you.

1465
01:07:05,958 --> 01:07:08,250
You and Paul should come over
for dinner sometime.

1466
01:07:08,333 --> 01:07:11,000
Oh, gosh. That would be great.
You know, whenever he gets back.

1467
01:07:11,083 --> 01:07:14,083
Ever since this whole franchise thing
started, he's always gone.

1468
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:17,375
Right now, he's up in San Francisco
looking for potential restaurant venues.

1469
01:07:17,458 --> 01:07:18,791
That's how it always goes.

1470
01:07:18,875 --> 01:07:21,333
Dad's jet-setting away
while Mom's stuck at home with the kids.

1471
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:23,833
Yes. Ugh. I agree.

1472
01:07:23,916 --> 01:07:25,666
Shockingly, I enjoy being with my kids.

1473
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:27,541
-I do too.
-I do too. Yeah.

1474
01:07:27,625 --> 01:07:29,500
That's hilarious. "I do too."

1475
01:07:31,250 --> 01:07:32,500
You guys are funny.

1476
01:07:34,250 --> 01:07:36,333
Hello? Anybody home?

1477
01:07:36,958 --> 01:07:38,333
Daddy!

1478
01:07:38,416 --> 01:07:39,708
What'd you bring us?

1479
01:07:39,791 --> 01:07:43,375
Bring you? I thought me arriving home
safely was your present?

1480
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:44,916
-[both] Boo!
-[Paul] Boo?

1481
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:48,291
Boo, you guys! Oh, no!
Wait, I forgot all the presents.

1482
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,583
I don't know why you guys think
I got you something.

1483
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:52,291
I don't know what's in here.

1484
01:07:54,083 --> 01:07:56,708
Who put this in here? A Warriors jersey!

1485
01:07:56,791 --> 01:07:58,000
Thanks, Paul!

1486
01:07:58,083 --> 01:07:59,958
-Golden Gate Legos.
-Yo! Yo, thanks.

1487
01:08:00,541 --> 01:08:01,541
Alcatraz hat.

1488
01:08:01,625 --> 01:08:02,833
Sick, thanks!

1489
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:04,250
Tupac sweatshirt.

1490
01:08:04,333 --> 01:08:05,333
What's up?

1491
01:08:05,416 --> 01:08:07,375
I wonder who this is for? iPhone case.

1492
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,166
-[Ella] Thank you!
-49ers socks.

1493
01:08:09,250 --> 01:08:10,833
-Did we get anything?
-Cool.

1494
01:08:10,916 --> 01:08:12,500
Like a hat or something else?

1495
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:15,750
Oh, no. What happened?
All that's left are my clothes.

1496
01:08:15,833 --> 01:08:17,375
I'm so sorry, guys.

1497
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,416
-But we're your best children.
-Yeah.

1498
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,083
You're right. You are my best children.

1499
01:08:21,166 --> 01:08:25,041
Let me see what-- [gasps]
Hotel chocolates and soap!

1500
01:08:25,125 --> 01:08:26,750
[all] Yay!

1501
01:08:26,833 --> 01:08:27,958
Candy!

1502
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:29,916
Soap!

1503
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,250
-Thank you, Daddy! Thank you!
-Thanks, Dad!

1504
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:33,875
They love soap.

1505
01:08:33,958 --> 01:08:35,458
I don't know why. They don't use it.

1506
01:08:37,375 --> 01:08:38,791
Well played, Mr. Baker.

1507
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:44,583
And of course, I couldn't come home
without a souvenir for Mommy.

1508
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:46,166
What?

1509
01:08:47,125 --> 01:08:48,125
Babe.

1510
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,500
It's beautiful.

1511
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:57,083
Baby, you didn't have to do this.
I love my ring.

1512
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:59,125
I know, but I've been wanting
to do this forever,

1513
01:08:59,208 --> 01:09:01,125
and I'm finally in a position
where I could.

1514
01:09:01,916 --> 01:09:04,125
That's the ring I should have bought you
ten years ago.

1515
01:09:05,291 --> 01:09:06,875
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

1516
01:09:06,958 --> 01:09:12,625
Well, out with the old
and in with the bling.

1517
01:09:12,708 --> 01:09:15,083
-[Paul laughing]
-Whoa!

1518
01:09:15,166 --> 01:09:17,208
-You like it?
-I love it.

1519
01:09:21,666 --> 01:09:22,666
[knocks]

1520
01:09:22,750 --> 01:09:24,250
-[Seth] Hey, man.
-Yo.

1521
01:09:24,333 --> 01:09:25,333
I got you something.

1522
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:28,625
Dude, what's this?

1523
01:09:29,208 --> 01:09:32,000
So you can get rid of those busted kicks
you keep getting clowned for.

1524
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:34,958
Ah. Nah, dog.
You-- You got it all wrong. Okay?

1525
01:09:35,041 --> 01:09:38,125
Like, me and my boys at school,
we just go back and forth like that. I--

1526
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:39,458
Stop. No, seriously.

1527
01:09:40,208 --> 01:09:42,375
You're making this uncomfortable
for both of us.

1528
01:09:42,458 --> 01:09:45,583
Now, I've seen what's been going on
at school, and I've been there.

1529
01:09:45,666 --> 01:09:47,416
I used to get clowned all the time.

1530
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:49,458
Shut up. You're just saying that
to make me feel better.

1531
01:09:49,541 --> 01:09:51,583
All right, dude. D-Dude. I'm serious.

1532
01:09:52,333 --> 01:09:53,500
You know, look at me.

1533
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:56,833
I've always been the weirdo
with the messed-up mom and no dad.

1534
01:10:01,250 --> 01:10:02,250
Open them.

1535
01:10:07,916 --> 01:10:09,708
[gasps] Yo!

1536
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:14,500
Dude, these-- These kicks are dope.

1537
01:10:14,583 --> 01:10:18,000
All right, but I can't take these.
Where'd you even get the money from?

1538
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,500
Don't worry about it.

1539
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:22,375
You know, all you need to do
is keep those jerks off your back.

1540
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:23,458
I'm gonna help you.

1541
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:25,375
I'll teach you how to defend yourself.

1542
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:26,458
Let's do this.

1543
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,583
Hey, guess what.

1544
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:33,583
Melanie and Michele wanna fly me back up
to look at restaurant spaces

1545
01:10:33,666 --> 01:10:34,666
over the next few days.

1546
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,000
-Again? You were just there.
-I know, I'm surprised too.

1547
01:10:37,083 --> 01:10:38,916
They said it's important
to nail it all down now.

1548
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:40,875
I thought we were all gonna talk
about it on the call tomorrow.

1549
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:43,375
Yeah, I guess they have, like,
a bunch of meetings tomorrow.

1550
01:10:43,458 --> 01:10:45,458
So we just kinda ended up
talking about it now.

1551
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:48,666
-Wait. Why didn't you come get me?
-Because you were giving the twins a bath.

1552
01:10:48,750 --> 01:10:51,125
And you didn't say you had to wait for me?

1553
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,333
Well, they just started talking,
and it was exciting and--

1554
01:10:53,416 --> 01:10:55,666
Babe, can I at least show you
what we talked about?

1555
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:56,916
It's really exciting.

1556
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,833
Look. Look at this.
Wait. Wait for it. Look at that.

1557
01:11:01,708 --> 01:11:02,708
-Whoa.
-Right?

1558
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:04,958
-Look at this.
-That's beautiful.

1559
01:11:05,041 --> 01:11:07,583
We could put a huge chalkboard right here.

1560
01:11:07,666 --> 01:11:11,125
A-And do a list of all the local vendors
and their farms.

1561
01:11:11,208 --> 01:11:13,041
About the local vendors,

1562
01:11:13,125 --> 01:11:16,000
they say that it's gonna be too expensive
now that we're expanding.

1563
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:20,083
Those personal touches are what makes
Baker's Breakfast, Baker's Breakfast.

1564
01:11:20,166 --> 01:11:22,916
And then the name is another thing too.

1565
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:28,541
I guess there's already a franchise that's
Baker's Breakfast Buffet or something,

1566
01:11:28,625 --> 01:11:31,750
and they're really worried
that our branding will get confused.

1567
01:11:31,833 --> 01:11:34,416
-So, we're changing our name too?
-But they said don't worry.

1568
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,958
They're gonna put, like,
a huge marketing team behind it.

1569
01:11:37,041 --> 01:11:38,333
Wait. Wait. Why? Why?

1570
01:11:38,416 --> 01:11:40,416
Didn't you tell them
I have a degree in marketing?

1571
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,125
I mean,
I came up with "Baker's Breakfast."

1572
01:11:42,208 --> 01:11:44,166
Yeah, but, babe,
it wasn't that revolutionary.

1573
01:11:44,250 --> 01:11:45,791
It's just my name and what I serve.

1574
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:56,625
So, last I checked,
it was our name and what we serve.

1575
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,708
I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean that, you know--

1576
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,625
I'm the face of the company. I'm the chef.

1577
01:12:00,708 --> 01:12:02,416
Look, I barely know the Malibu Barbies,

1578
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:05,166
and I get that they
don't value my opinion,

1579
01:12:05,250 --> 01:12:08,958
but I can't believe that you're trying
to edge me out too.

1580
01:12:09,041 --> 01:12:12,083
I am not trying to edge you out, baby.
Come on. I promise.

1581
01:12:12,166 --> 01:12:14,750
I barely know them. I just--
I don't wanna create any obstacles.

1582
01:12:14,833 --> 01:12:17,541
Oh, so now I'm an obstacle. Right.

1583
01:12:17,625 --> 01:12:22,750
Come on. I didn't mean it like that.
Look, Zoey, this is my dream.

1584
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:28,750
Right. Your dream. And I'm dreamless.

-Oh! Geez.

Would that help while he's gone?

-Um, thank you for that offer, but no.
-Mm-hmm.

-Yes.
-Uh-huh.

Oh, no. No. We're not together.

Oh, I'm sorry.

01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:44,333
Because you're grounded,
not to play video games.

1661
01:15:44,416 --> 01:15:46,458
Come on. It's not Haresh's fault.
The guys at school--

1662
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:48,125
I don't care whose fault it is.

1663
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:49,875
You both could have gotten
kicked out of school.

1664
01:15:49,958 --> 01:15:51,291
Hand over the remotes now.

1665
01:15:55,208 --> 01:15:57,875
Dad leaves,
and you all lose your minds all at once.

1666
01:15:59,583 --> 01:16:01,708
-Hey. Where are you going?
-I have plans with Chris.

1667
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:02,708
-Now?
-Tonight.

1668
01:16:02,791 --> 01:16:04,208
No way. No.

1669
01:16:04,291 --> 01:16:06,125
Babe, you've got homework
and practice tomorrow.

1670
01:16:06,208 --> 01:16:08,416
And besides, I need your help
with your brothers and sisters

1671
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:09,500
until Paul gets back.

1672
01:16:09,583 --> 01:16:12,291
And when's that?
It's not like he's ever here anymore.

1673
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:15,791
You know what? Hand over the keys.

1674
01:16:15,875 --> 01:16:17,625
This is so unfair.

1675
01:16:19,291 --> 01:16:21,666
-Hey, if she's not using those, then…
-Don't even.

1676

What do you think?

1680
01:16:56,666 --> 01:16:58,875
I don't understand.
I thought we were seeing new spaces.

1681
01:16:58,958 --> 01:17:01,666
I thought we agreed this place
smelled like mouse poop.

1682
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,958
And why are there lunch items
on this menu?

1683
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:06,875
Marketing collected some data.
People love soup.

1684
01:17:06,958 --> 01:17:09,125
Last we checked,
there are no breakfast soups.

1685
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:11,708
Well, if they want soup,
they can eat at a nursing home.

1686
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:14,208
I do breakfast. That's my thing.
I'm the breakfast guy.

1687
01:17:14,291 --> 01:17:17,541
Stop thinking small.
You're not a mom-and-pop anymore.

-Breakfast!

Oh, thank you. I had no idea
everything that went into it.

1697
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:41,250
You know, Paul and I usually plan
all these kids' parties together.

1698
01:17:41,333 --> 01:17:43,083
I can't believe he's still
in San Francisco.

1699
01:17:43,166 --> 01:17:44,958
I know.
He should be back any minute though.

1700
01:17:45,041 --> 01:17:47,125
[sighs] But I have to go upstairs.

1701
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:50,083
DJ and Deja
don't wanna come out of their rooms.

1702

Ugh, tell me about it.

1703
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:53,750

for two years.

Well, if you guys need anything, ask Kate.

1706

She's always really helpful.
No, she is not, so enjoy that.

1707

in another life?

I need to talk to Paul.

Sweetheart, I don't know where Paul is,

No! Definitely not.

1726
01:18:45,708 --> 01:18:48,000
It's fine. I'll just do what Paul said.

We're no longer boarding.

Oh, no, no. Please, please.
It's my son's birthday party.

-No, I am not extending the jetway.

Look, um, I make the most amazing sauce.

It's hot, sweet, and savory,

I will provide you with a lifetime supply

Sir. Sir!

So it's hot, sweet or savory
depending on what you put it on.

"Do you want some hot sauce?"

It's so throwback that you don't have
any celebrity performers.

1762
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:29,375
It's like when we were kids,

1763

be bothered with us.

Anyways, you guys. This is very upsetting.

1766
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:41,500
There've been a series of break-ins
in the neighborhood.

-That's awful.
-Terrible.

Oh, and this is for the birthday boy.

And also, just out of total curiosity,

1773
01:20:57,166 --> 01:21:01,208
do you know
where he was last night at 9:32?

1774

to do with these break-ins?

that he had gotten into a lot of trouble
before he came here.

01:23:00,208 --> 01:23:01,541
-Great job, honey.
-Thanks, Mom.

1824
01:23:01,625 --> 01:23:04,916
I'm so sorry I'm late.
You will not believe what happened to me.

1825
01:23:05,000 --> 01:23:06,541
I had to charter a jet, babe.

1826
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:09,625
Wow! DJ, what is this outfit?

1827
01:23:09,708 --> 01:23:12,541
Just doing what you told me to do
to get girls. And look, it's working!

1828
01:23:12,625 --> 01:23:15,750
-You told my son to be a Satanist?
-No. No, no, no.

1829
01:23:15,833 --> 01:23:19,333
I told him to get into
whatever the girl he likes is into.

1830
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:22,208
I didn't know
that she was into punk rock Fonzie.

1831
01:23:22,291 --> 01:23:24,958
Why are you even talking to my son
about any of these things?

1832
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:26,833
'Cause he knows me better than you do,
Dad.

1833
01:23:26,916 --> 01:23:29,583
What's my favorite color?
Who's my favorite superhero?

1834
01:23:29,666 --> 01:23:33,166
Name five rules
for surviving a zombie apocalypse. Go!

1835
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:35,458
Okay, look.

1836
01:23:36,041 --> 01:23:37,041
[stammers]

1837
01:23:37,125 --> 01:23:39,875
I don't need to know how to kill
a zombie to know how to raise my son.

1838
01:23:39,958 --> 01:23:42,166
You think any of this mess
would happen with me in charge?

1839
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,166
Really? 'Cause you did such a terrific job
the last time?

1840
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:48,583
[chuckles] Yeah, whatever.
This whole house is out of control.

1841
01:23:48,666 --> 01:23:50,916
You got kids fighting
and getting suspended,

1842
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:52,833
and spending all night
at some boy's house!

1843
01:23:52,916 --> 01:23:55,208
-Who spent the night at a boy's house?
-[all] Deja.

1844
01:23:55,291 --> 01:23:56,458
What?

1845
01:23:57,166 --> 01:23:58,916
And since when do you skip practice?

1846
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:00,625
Since I stopped playing basketball.
I quit.

1847
01:24:00,708 --> 01:24:03,250
You can't quit.
You've worked too hard for this.

1848
01:24:03,333 --> 01:24:06,083
Who cares? They won't put me in anyway
since we didn't donate the gym.

1849
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,208
No. No, no. We got scouts from SC coming
to that game on Saturday.

1850
01:24:09,291 --> 01:24:10,750
You are not just gonna walk away.

1851
01:24:10,833 --> 01:24:13,000
You understand?
This is your life we're talking about.

1852
01:24:13,083 --> 01:24:15,000
Yeah, and basketball's only part of it.

1853
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,458
I loved it because I love my team,

1854
01:24:16,541 --> 01:24:18,583
but it sucks playing
with those stupid, snobby girls

1855
01:24:18,666 --> 01:24:20,000
at that stupid, snobby school.

1856
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:22,500
You can't quit
just 'cause you don't like your teammates.

1857
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:25,333
-You can't force me to play.
-[Dom] You know what? This is ridiculous.

1858
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:27,833
I'm not leaving my kids in this madhouse
another minute.

1859
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:30,958
And you guys can forget
about joint custody. I'm filing for full.

1860
01:24:31,041 --> 01:24:32,625
You are being ridiculous.

1861
01:24:32,708 --> 01:24:34,625
-I'm not living with you.
-Oh, yes, you are.

1862
01:24:34,708 --> 01:24:36,666
And, Deja,
you're playing in that game on Saturday.

1863
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,500
Yeah, and then you're gonna come
straight home, because you're grounded.

1864
01:24:39,583 --> 01:24:41,750
-Chris and I were going to the movies--
-No more Chris.

1865
01:24:41,833 --> 01:24:43,666
-You can't do that.
-Yes, I can. Can I do that?

1866
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:46,000
-Yes, you can.
-Good, 'cause I just did. No more Chris.

1867
01:24:46,083 --> 01:24:47,916
That's not fair.
Chris is the only good thing

1868
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:50,333
that's happened to me
since I've been here. I hate it here.

1869
01:24:50,916 --> 01:24:52,041
We all do.

1870
01:24:52,125 --> 01:24:54,666
A rent-a-cop trails Mom
every time she leaves the house.

1871
01:24:54,750 --> 01:24:56,916
People here call Harley's ramp an eyesore.

1872
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,666
Bronx and Bailey are too scared to sleep.

1873
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:03,500
And Haresh is getting his face kicked
in by losers at school all the time.

1874
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:06,166
Yo! Your boy got a few hits in. Trust.

1875
01:25:08,333 --> 01:25:09,916
I honestly thought you were all happy.

1876
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:12,291
No, you're happy.
And you didn't notice that we aren't,

1877
01:25:12,375 --> 01:25:13,958
because as soon as you made us move here,

1878
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:17,000
you took off to do your dumb franchise
and left us here to deal with it.

1879
01:25:18,958 --> 01:25:22,583
Wow. I didn't know
we were allowed to go off like that.

1880
01:25:23,083 --> 01:25:24,916
I've missed so many opportunities.

1881
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:28,583
Okay, Deja isn't "going off." Okay?

1882
01:25:28,666 --> 01:25:31,458
She's speaking honestly
about her feelings.

1883
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:33,583
Which is how we've raised you all to be.

1884
01:25:34,791 --> 01:25:36,041
So I'm glad you spoke up.

1885
01:25:36,708 --> 01:25:38,416
-Really?
-Yep.

1886
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:40,416
Yeah, your mom is right.

1887
01:25:40,500 --> 01:25:43,750
Look, let's calm down,
and let's go to the party.

1888
01:25:43,833 --> 01:25:46,875
-Look, I-- Let me--
-Dom, please. Please, for DJ.

1889
01:25:47,875 --> 01:25:49,041
[Kate] Here we go.

1890
01:25:49,125 --> 01:25:51,375
-Okay, come on.
-Everybody-- Hey, Resh.

1891
01:25:51,458 --> 01:25:53,500
-You're grounded.
-Dad!

1892
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:56,000
-[Zoey sighs]
-[Paul sighs]

1893
01:25:59,041 --> 01:26:01,333
Deja.
That is so incredibly out of line, huh?

1894
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:04,083
Babe, you just said
that you were glad that she spoke up.

1895
01:26:04,166 --> 01:26:06,541
Because I'm trying
to be a united front, Zoey.

1896
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:10,083
I mean, does she not have any idea
how hard I'm trying to make all this work?

1897
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:13,000
Paul, you gotta face it.

1898
01:26:13,083 --> 01:26:15,750
It's not gonna work,
because it's not working.

1899
01:26:15,833 --> 01:26:18,791
This neighborhood. The schools.
The franchise.

1900
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:20,291
None of it is right for us.

1901
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:22,291
Why are you just telling me this now?

1902
01:26:22,375 --> 01:26:26,458
Well, babe,
because I was proud and so excited

1903
01:26:26,541 --> 01:26:28,750
watching you go big with your sauce.

1904
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:32,833
And I-- I just went along with
all the other bigger and better stuff too.

1905
01:26:33,333 --> 01:26:36,208
Of course, I-- I wanna give our kids more.

1906
01:26:36,291 --> 01:26:38,791
Let's just do it our way
like we always have.

1907
01:26:43,625 --> 01:26:44,625
Wow.

1908
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:50,583
I've been gone so much I really had
no idea everyone was this unhappy.

1909
01:26:51,375 --> 01:26:52,750
I don't know. I guess, I just--

1910
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:58,083
I was trying to prove to you that I could
give everybody everything they wanted.

1911
01:26:58,166 --> 01:27:00,458
I don't know.
I got carried away by those Barbies,

1912
01:27:00,541 --> 01:27:02,666
and they almost convinced me
to make lunch.

1913
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,875
That's blasphemy.

1914
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:04,958
[laughs]

1915
01:27:06,333 --> 01:27:08,416
But you're right. I can feel it.
This isn't us.

1916
01:27:08,500 --> 01:27:10,750
This McMansion and the private schools
and that ring.

1917
01:27:10,833 --> 01:27:12,125
Whoa, whoa. [stammers]

1918
01:27:12,208 --> 01:27:13,416
The ring-- The ring works.

1919
01:27:13,500 --> 01:27:14,666
[chuckles]

1920
01:27:21,750 --> 01:27:23,083
Come back for a goody bag?

1921
01:27:26,458 --> 01:27:28,625
No, actually,
I'm here to pick up Deja and DJ.

1922
01:27:28,708 --> 01:27:31,583
Or do you not remember me saying
I'm not leaving them here?

1923
01:27:31,666 --> 01:27:34,750
Doesn't sound like I'm going to get
any argument from Deja.

1924
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:37,458
-You know, she hates it here.
-Deja's a teenager, Dom.

1925
01:27:37,541 --> 01:27:39,458
She hates everything
that doesn't go her way.

1926
01:27:40,083 --> 01:27:43,625
And I think DJ made it very clear
that he does not wanna go with you.

1927
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:44,708
Well,

1928
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:47,916
DJ doesn't know what's good for him.

1929
01:27:49,666 --> 01:27:52,083
You do realize they're my children, right?

1930
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:54,875
Of course, I do, but with all due respect,
they're my family too.

1931
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,625
Just because we don't have the same blood

1932
01:27:56,708 --> 01:27:59,541
-or skin color doesn't mean that--
-Okay. No. Stop. Stop.

1933
01:28:01,250 --> 01:28:03,291
Please, don't dismiss that

1934
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:07,166
like we're talking about sharing
the same birthday or taste in music,

1935
01:28:07,250 --> 01:28:08,250
because we are not.

1936
01:28:09,875 --> 01:28:11,625
We're talking about an experience that--

1937
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:12,875
[sighs]

1938
01:28:12,958 --> 01:28:14,250
That you'll never understand.

1939
01:28:14,333 --> 01:28:16,625
You do realize
that I have Black children too, right?

1940
01:28:16,708 --> 01:28:18,666
Listen, man,
just because you married a Black woman

1941
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:21,208
and had babies with a Black woman,
does not mean that you know

1942
01:28:21,291 --> 01:28:23,833
how to handle everything
that's about to be thrown at them.

1943
01:28:24,708 --> 01:28:28,125
You have no idea what DJ's gonna
have to go through in a couple of years.

1944
01:28:28,208 --> 01:28:30,083
I see what you put him through now.

1945
01:28:30,166 --> 01:28:32,250
You can't accept the fact
he's this sweet, goofy nerd

1946
01:28:32,333 --> 01:28:33,833
who wants to play Dungeons & Dragons.

1947
01:28:33,916 --> 01:28:36,875
Yeah! Yeah, that's how we see him.

1948
01:28:37,750 --> 01:28:41,208
But, Paul, he's about to become a man

1949
01:28:42,250 --> 01:28:44,916
who's gonna be seen as a threat
in this racist world

1950
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,208
no matter what he does.

1951
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:48,958
Do you honestly think
that I don't understand that?

1952
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:51,916
Listen, Paul. Bro…

1953
01:28:53,666 --> 01:28:56,166
I went from a little, skinny kid
in the Wild 100s

1954
01:28:56,250 --> 01:28:59,333
on the South Side of Chicago
to a three-time MVP.

1955
01:28:59,416 --> 01:29:02,541
And I still get pulled over
in every city I live in.

1956
01:29:05,083 --> 01:29:07,125
[stammers] You can't prepare him for that.

1957
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:10,875
Because you have no idea what that's like.
How it feels.

1958
01:29:11,708 --> 01:29:13,333
How terrifying it is.

1959
01:29:14,875 --> 01:29:15,875
Every time.

1960
01:29:18,625 --> 01:29:19,625
[sighs]

1961
01:29:20,125 --> 01:29:23,125
You're right. You're absolutely right.
I have never experienced that,

1962
01:29:23,208 --> 01:29:24,291
and I never will.

1963
01:29:26,708 --> 01:29:29,291
And I respect everything you're saying.

1964
01:29:31,583 --> 01:29:33,041
But one thing I do have.

1965
01:29:34,083 --> 01:29:38,041
I have an incredible bond
with both of your kids,

1966
01:29:39,458 --> 01:29:41,916
because I'm here, boots-on-the-ground.

1967
01:29:42,000 --> 01:29:43,500
And I love them.

1968
01:29:43,583 --> 01:29:45,000
And they love me.

1969
01:29:46,208 --> 01:29:48,875
And I am doing
absolutely everything I can.

1970
01:29:48,958 --> 01:29:50,875
And I'm saying that's not good enough.

1971
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,500
Night, guys.

1972
01:29:58,583 --> 01:30:00,791
Before you go in,
there's something we need to tell you.

1973
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:04,041
-What'd you do? Where's my money?
-Yo, what are you talking about?

1974
01:30:04,125 --> 01:30:06,083
Save the act, Seth.
We know you're a thief.

1975
01:30:06,166 --> 01:30:09,166
Harley heard the Real Housewives
of Calabasas talking about some break-ins,

1976
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:11,166
and we knew it was you. So, busted.

1977
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:14,500
Okay, just because you don't like him,
doesn't make him guilty. It's not that--

1978
01:30:14,583 --> 01:30:16,875
No, but the fact
that he had five hundos in there does.

1979
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:19,875
And didn't you say
he bought you a $200 pair of sneakers?

1980
01:30:19,958 --> 01:30:20,833
Well, yes--

1981
01:30:20,916 --> 01:30:23,375
You told us you saw him stealing
from the cash register, didn't you?

1982
01:30:25,541 --> 01:30:28,208
You know, I'm so stupid.
How did I think you people cared about me?

1983
01:30:28,291 --> 01:30:29,416
Seth, please, it's--

1984
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:31,250
-Please, I--
-I put it back, by the way.

1985
01:30:31,333 --> 01:30:32,666
Not that you people care.

1986
01:30:35,500 --> 01:30:36,583
Good job.

1987
01:30:36,666 --> 01:30:37,666
Wait, Haresh.

1988
01:30:38,833 --> 01:30:41,000
-I'm out of here.
-What's the matter?

1989
01:30:41,083 --> 01:30:42,750
I don't know what you're trying to prove,

1990
01:30:42,833 --> 01:30:44,875
but stop trying to pretend
I'm part of your family.

1991
01:30:44,958 --> 01:30:45,958
I'm cool on my own.

1992
01:30:47,791 --> 01:30:48,958
Seth, wait!

1993
01:30:49,041 --> 01:30:50,041
[pants]

1994
01:30:50,125 --> 01:30:51,500
Let me see what's going on.

1995
01:30:53,125 --> 01:30:56,750
No, you guys, that money isn't stolen.
It's from DCFS.

1996
01:30:56,833 --> 01:30:59,125
The state gives us money
to cover Seth's living expenses,

1997
01:30:59,208 --> 01:31:00,375
but we just give it to him.

1998
01:31:00,458 --> 01:31:02,750
-What about the break-ins?
-[Zoey] It wasn't Seth.

1999
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:06,583
Someone broke into Anne's house
during the party while Seth was grounded.

2000
01:31:06,666 --> 01:31:09,500
Seth is still out there,
and we have no idea where to look for him.

2001
01:31:11,500 --> 01:31:13,291
-I think I do.
-Yo--

2002
01:31:13,958 --> 01:31:15,250
-Come on!
-Hey, let's go!

2003
01:31:15,333 --> 01:31:17,416
No, no, no. No. You guys-- No.

2004
01:31:18,083 --> 01:31:21,000
He doesn't need our help right--
Harley-- Wait just a second.

2005
01:31:21,083 --> 01:31:23,875
Deja, DJ, get down here right now.
We're leaving.

2006
01:31:23,958 --> 01:31:26,083
No, Dom. No.

2007
01:31:26,166 --> 01:31:28,416
Nobody is going anywhere.

2008
01:31:29,458 --> 01:31:30,458
Gotta go.

2009
01:31:31,916 --> 01:31:32,916
What?

2010
01:31:33,416 --> 01:31:36,541
You know-- Deja, DJ, let's go, right now.

2011
01:31:36,625 --> 01:31:38,291
[Baker children] Daddy!

2012
01:31:38,375 --> 01:31:40,791
-[Baker children clamoring]
-Hey, watch out!

2013
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:41,875
Ow!

2014
01:31:41,958 --> 01:31:43,875
-Let's go!
-Hey-- Wait a-- Wait a second.

2015
01:31:43,958 --> 01:31:47,083
-Wait, wait-- Hey, hey.
-Guys, guys, guys, please, please.

2016
01:31:47,166 --> 01:31:48,500
Dad's okay on his own.

2017
01:31:48,583 --> 01:31:50,458
-What's going on?
-What's wrong? Where's Paul?

2018
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:52,083
Okay, everybody, calm down.

2019
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:55,625
He's fine. He just went down
to First and Whittier to look for Seth.

2020
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:58,083
-Wait, First and Whittier?
-Yeah.

2021
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:01,458
-Paul?
-Yeah?

2022
01:32:08,500 --> 01:32:12,416
[chattering]

2023
01:32:15,291 --> 01:32:16,666
Evening, sir.

2024
01:32:17,791 --> 01:32:22,250
Uh, listen, I'm looking for my nephew.
Have you-- Have you seen this kid?

2025
01:32:23,208 --> 01:32:26,083
Nope.
But I see you got that new iPhone 12.

2026
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:28,083
-Yeah. I do--
-Uncle Paul?

2027
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,625
Seth. You're okay.

2028
01:32:32,250 --> 01:32:34,083
-How'd you find me?
-Are you kidding?

2029
01:32:34,166 --> 01:32:36,833
I've been sending you birthday cards here
for years.

2030
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:38,583
-Come on. I'm here to take you home.
-Just go.

2031
01:32:38,666 --> 01:32:40,041
[Baker children] Seth!

2032
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,583
Seth!

2033
01:32:41,666 --> 01:32:43,875
-[Kate] There he is! You found him! Yes!
-[littles] Daddy! Daddy!

2034
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:46,250
-Guys, what're you-- Babe, I got this.
-Seth!

2035
01:32:46,333 --> 01:32:47,916
-[littles] Daddy!
-[Kate] All right.

2036
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,375
-Daddy!
-[Paul] Hi, guys--

2037
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:53,083
Don't worry. He already had booster seats.
The bird man has four kids.

2038
01:32:53,166 --> 01:32:54,333
[chuckles]

2039
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:57,041
Yo. Who invited the Jackson 9?

2040
01:32:57,125 --> 01:32:59,916
If y'all looking for Disneyland,
you made a wrong turn.

2041
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:04,250
-Seth, thank God we found you.
-Please come home, Seth?

2042
01:33:04,333 --> 01:33:06,250
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

2043
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,458
[Bailey] Please.

2044
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:09,083
Ooh.

2045
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:12,333
This you, player?

2046
01:33:12,416 --> 01:33:15,458
-Stop it.
-Hey. Don't objectify my mommy.

2047
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:18,708
Okay. Let's-- Everyone-- Let's go.
I got this, okay? I can take it from here.

2048
01:33:18,791 --> 01:33:20,666
-Moving out.
-[Baker children] No!

2049
01:33:20,750 --> 01:33:23,041
No way. We're staying.

2050
01:33:23,125 --> 01:33:24,875
I mean, we're family, man.

2051
01:33:24,958 --> 01:33:26,541
And we got your back, dude.

2052
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:27,916
-Yeah.
-[Baker children] Yeah.

2053
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:30,166
-Definitely.
-Yeah, I do too, Seth.

2054
01:33:30,250 --> 01:33:34,375
Uh, you know, even though I didn't really
when Harley and I accused you of stealing.

2055
01:33:34,458 --> 01:33:36,833
Yeah, that was kind of harsh. My bad.

2056
01:33:36,916 --> 01:33:39,750
You're the only one that knows
how to make monster spray.

2057
01:33:39,833 --> 01:33:41,375
We need refills.

2058
01:33:41,458 --> 01:33:43,791
Bro, come back, dude.

2059
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:47,416
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have
made it through these past few weeks.

2060
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:48,500
You're my bro.

2061
01:33:48,583 --> 01:33:52,083
You had my back when I needed you,
and now I'm a legend.

2062
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:54,500
-OG homeys for life, dude.
-[chuckles]

2063
01:33:56,041 --> 01:33:57,708
Little Indian dude's got heart.

2064
01:33:58,333 --> 01:33:59,416
And a nice chain.

2065
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,500
-I see you, player. Give me some.
-Thank you.

2066
01:34:01,583 --> 01:34:03,708
-[Bailey] Dude.
-Okay, look, Seth--

2067
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:07,958
Please come home, Seth.
I'll introduce you to my teddy bears.

2068
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:11,791
Seth, I know you're upset.

2069
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:16,708
I get it. You have been passed around
so much you don't know who to trust.

2070
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:19,333
That's not fair.

2071
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:21,500
I promise you
this time's gonna be different.

2072
01:34:21,583 --> 01:34:25,041
No matter what happens with your mom,
you're always gonna have a home with us.

2073
01:34:25,125 --> 01:34:26,125
-Right, guys?
-Yeah, man.

2074
01:34:26,208 --> 01:34:27,416
-Yeah.
-[Bailey] Definitely.

2075
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,166
-Yeah!
-Come down.

2076
01:34:29,250 --> 01:34:30,583
Thanks, guys. I--

2077
01:34:30,666 --> 01:34:33,458
I know you mean it, but let's face it.
[sighs]

2078
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:35,666
I'm never gonna fit into
your fancy new life.

2079
01:34:35,750 --> 01:34:37,208
Well, guess what.

2080
01:34:37,291 --> 01:34:40,333
We don't fit in with our fancy new life
either. Right, guys?

2081
01:34:40,416 --> 01:34:41,833
-Not in the slightest!
-No!

2082
01:34:41,916 --> 01:34:43,000
-Come on.
-Come on, Seth!

2083
01:34:43,083 --> 01:34:46,500
Come home, Seth.
Love like this is hard to find.

2084
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:49,333
-[Baker children] Seth! Seth! Seth!
-[chuckles]

2085
01:34:49,916 --> 01:34:51,125
Come on.

2086
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:53,375
-Come on, Seth!
-Come on, man.

2087
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:55,541
[Baker children] Seth! Seth! Seth!

2088
01:34:55,625 --> 01:34:57,416
Seth! Seth! Seth!

2089
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:59,000
-Seth! Seth! Seth!
-Seth! Come home.

2090
01:34:59,083 --> 01:35:00,208
See you later, guys.

2091
01:35:03,333 --> 01:35:05,375
-Let's go home.
-[Baker family cheers]

2092
01:35:05,458 --> 01:35:06,833
-[Haresh] Woo-hoo!
-[DJ] Yeah!

2093
01:35:08,583 --> 01:35:10,291
Seth! Seth! Seth!

2094
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:11,583
Seth! Seth! Seth!

2095
01:35:11,666 --> 01:35:13,375
-Seth! Seth!
-Come on, man.

2096
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,916
Seth! Seth!

2097
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:18,541
-Seth! Seth! Seth!
-How about a group hug? Group hug!

2098
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:21,000
[Luna] Yay! Woo-hoo! [laughs]

2099
01:35:21,083 --> 01:35:22,708
[Paul] Don't crush the twins.

2100
01:35:22,791 --> 01:35:23,791
Hey!

2101
01:35:25,208 --> 01:35:28,083
Oh. [stammers]
I hate when I get so emotional.

2102
01:35:32,500 --> 01:35:34,166
[Dom] All right. Hey.

2103
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:36,583
-[Paul] Hey.
-[Luna] Are we home?

2104
01:35:36,666 --> 01:35:37,958
Yeah, baby, we're home.

2105
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:41,375
You guys go upstairs and get in bed.
I'll come tuck you in. Okay?

2106
01:35:41,458 --> 01:35:42,750
-Okay.
-Okay.

2107
01:35:43,458 --> 01:35:44,708
-Thank you, Dom.
-Yeah.

2108
01:35:44,791 --> 01:35:46,500
Hey, guys. [sighs]

2109
01:35:47,250 --> 01:35:48,250
Uh…

2110
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:53,250
I overreacted, you know, about the whole
full custody thing. I don't mean that.

2111
01:35:54,041 --> 01:35:57,083
You know, you and Zoey are raising
an amazing family here,

2112
01:35:57,166 --> 01:35:59,458
and I'm glad you guys are part of it.

2113
01:35:59,541 --> 01:36:01,000
And you're right, Paul.

2114
01:36:01,083 --> 01:36:06,083
I missed out on a lot
of the boots-on-the-ground stuff.

2115
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:08,958
You know, teaching this guy
to brush his teeth, ride a bike--

2116
01:36:09,041 --> 01:36:10,916
Do not regret the teeth stuff.

2117
01:36:11,000 --> 01:36:13,083
I'm telling you,
a four-year-old's morning breath--

2118
01:36:13,166 --> 01:36:15,333
It's like a tiny dragon melting your face.

2119
01:36:15,416 --> 01:36:17,250
-[imitates dragon breath]
-[DJ laughing]

2120
01:36:17,333 --> 01:36:18,333
Still, man,

2121
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,208
you got all that,

2122
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:23,625
and I didn't.

2123
01:36:24,208 --> 01:36:25,708
-So, wait, you're jealous of me?
-No.

2124
01:36:25,791 --> 01:36:28,291
-No, that-- Of course not. No.
-That wouldn't make any sense.

2125
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:30,333
And DJ, you're right, buddy.

2126
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,750
I don't know anything
about what you're into.

2127
01:36:32,833 --> 01:36:35,125
-Yeah.
-But I really want to.

2128
01:36:36,333 --> 01:36:37,875
-Really?
-Yeah.

2129
01:36:38,750 --> 01:36:42,000
Yeah, I tell you what. How about
you and me go to Comic-Con this year?

2130
01:36:42,083 --> 01:36:43,708
You know, make some noise.
What do you say?

2131
01:36:43,791 --> 01:36:46,416
What? Yeah. Heck yeah.

2132
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:47,625
Yo, you wanna cosplay?

2133
01:36:47,708 --> 01:36:49,333
[stammers]

2134
01:36:49,416 --> 01:36:51,791
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Whatever you want.

2135
01:36:51,875 --> 01:36:54,875
Yes! I'ma bring my comics.
We have so many choices.

2136
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,375
Cool. [chuckles] All right, man.

2137
01:36:58,750 --> 01:37:00,291
What did I just get myself into here?

2138
01:37:00,375 --> 01:37:05,166
You, my friend, just got yourself into
a pair of 4XL tights and a cape.

2139
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:07,250
That's gonna be great.

2140
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:16,208
Thank you for asking that.

2141
01:37:16,291 --> 01:37:18,125
That is a great question, Bethany.
Thank you.

2142
01:37:18,208 --> 01:37:20,375
-Hi. I'm sorry to interrupt.
-I tried. I couldn't stop him.

2143
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:22,791
Paul, what's up?
We aren't scheduled to sign the paperwork

2144
01:37:22,875 --> 01:37:24,916
-until next week.
-Yeah, that's no longer happening.

2145
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,791
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about lunch, Melanie.

2146
01:37:27,875 --> 01:37:30,791
That ridiculous little meal
between breakfast and dinner,

2147
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:33,083
which, FYI, I am also not doing.

2148
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,041
Paul, I think you're overreacting.

2149
01:37:35,125 --> 01:37:38,000
Am I? Because let me tell you
a little something about me.

2150
01:37:38,083 --> 01:37:40,708
I love breakfast.

2151
01:37:40,791 --> 01:37:43,416
Breakfast is my jam.

2152
01:37:44,541 --> 01:37:47,208
Jam is also my jam.
There're some wonderful jams.

2153
01:37:47,291 --> 01:37:50,041
I love marmalades, um, jellies.

2154
01:37:50,125 --> 01:37:53,125
Quince paste is delightful sometimes
on a cheese board.

2155
01:37:53,875 --> 01:37:55,333
I digress. I don't want any of it.

2156
01:37:55,416 --> 01:37:58,833
I want my name back, I want my brand back,
and I want all the rights to my sauce.

2157
01:37:58,916 --> 01:38:00,541
I've sold enough to buy it all back.

2158
01:38:00,625 --> 01:38:03,708
Paul, if you walk away from this
over a lunch menu,

2159
01:38:03,791 --> 01:38:05,250
you're making a huge mistake.

2160
01:38:05,333 --> 01:38:06,583
-Huge mistake.
-[Paul] I know.

2161
01:38:06,666 --> 01:38:09,458
"Millions of dollars and becoming
a household name" and all that.

2162
01:38:09,541 --> 01:38:12,666
Well, guess what. Chef Boyardee was
a rock star, but that's not me.

2163
01:38:12,750 --> 01:38:15,875
I would rather be broke and at home,
making omelets for my kids

2164
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:18,875
than being a corporate sellout,
making soup for you two.

2165
01:38:19,458 --> 01:38:21,375
Chef Boyardee was a real person?

2166
01:38:21,458 --> 01:38:24,375
You're not gonna, like, sue me for this,
are you? Please don't.

2167
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:27,166
'Cause I don't--
I have so many children, and they're--

2168
01:38:27,250 --> 01:38:28,833
They're so expensive.

2169
01:38:28,916 --> 01:38:29,916
She knows.

2170
01:38:32,458 --> 01:38:34,416
Cool if I come by tomorrow
to help you unpack?

2171
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:36,500
I don't know.

2172
01:38:36,583 --> 01:38:38,625
Calabasas to Echo Park is no joke.

2173
01:38:39,291 --> 01:38:41,791
You sure you're up
for a long-distance relationship?

2174
01:38:41,875 --> 01:38:44,583
-You think I'm scared of a little traffic?
-You should be.

2175
01:38:45,291 --> 01:38:47,250
I am. But you're worth it.

2176
01:38:47,333 --> 01:38:48,541
[chuckles]

2177
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:49,708
You're so corny.

2178
01:38:49,791 --> 01:38:51,750
-[Tricia, Zoey] Aw.
-[Karen chuckles]

2179
01:38:51,833 --> 01:38:54,541
Okay, now you have to promise
that you're still gonna come around

2180
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:56,000
-for our mommy playdates.
-Yeah.

2181
01:38:56,083 --> 01:38:58,208
Are you kidding me? Of course.

2182
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,416
[gasps] Wait, is, uh…

2183
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:01,041
Is Anne gonna be there?

2184
01:39:01,125 --> 01:39:02,416
Oh, no.

2185
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:04,583
She moved to Idaho for the diversity.

2186
01:39:05,708 --> 01:39:06,708
That tracks.

2187
01:39:07,791 --> 01:39:09,666
-[Deja] Hey, Paul.
-Yeah?

2188
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:14,166
I'm glad we're leaving, but I'm sorry
for being such a jerk to you about it.

2189
01:39:14,250 --> 01:39:15,833
You weren't being a jerk.

2190
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:18,625
I appreciate everything you said.

2191
01:39:19,375 --> 01:39:23,583
You know, sometimes one of the most
loving things you can do for someone

2192
01:39:24,083 --> 01:39:26,833
is tell them a hard truth
that they really need to hear.

2193
01:39:26,916 --> 01:39:28,166
You suck at basketball.

2194
01:39:31,833 --> 01:39:33,958
Why would you lie

2195
01:39:34,041 --> 01:39:37,125
when I just gave you a lecture
about the truth?

2196
01:39:37,750 --> 01:39:41,708
[Paul] So we moved out of Calabasas
and back to vibrant LA.

2197
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,958
The kids went back to their old schools.

2198
01:39:44,041 --> 01:39:45,750
-[Zoey] Deja rejoined her old team…
-Come on, Deja!

2199
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:47,458
…and got her scholarship to USC.

2200
01:39:48,958 --> 01:39:50,666
-[bird man] Come on!
-[Kate] She's so good.

2201
01:39:50,750 --> 01:39:54,666
[Paul] Kate got a great guy
with four kids and nine birds.

2202
01:39:54,750 --> 01:39:58,708
[Zoey] And Dom got a cool new girlfriend
with two dogs and very healthy boundaries.

2203
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:00,041
[Paul] That's a little tight.

2204
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,250
[both grunting]

2205
01:40:02,333 --> 01:40:03,541
[cheering]

2206
01:40:03,625 --> 01:40:05,000
My house, baby.

2207
01:40:05,083 --> 01:40:06,291
What?

2208
01:40:06,375 --> 01:40:10,333
[Paul] And we found the perfect home
for our perfectly imperfect family.

2209
01:40:10,416 --> 01:40:13,083
Wait, you guys, before we go in,
let's all take a selfie.

2210
01:40:13,166 --> 01:40:14,250
Here we go.

2211
01:40:15,208 --> 01:40:18,291
[Baker family cheers]

2212
01:40:20,375 --> 01:40:21,708
[Paul] All right, baby, try this.

2213
01:40:24,375 --> 01:40:25,375
Mmm.

2214
01:40:25,875 --> 01:40:28,583
-Yum. What is that?
-Right? It's my latest invention.

2215
01:40:28,666 --> 01:40:30,541
It's a croissant soufflé.

2216
01:40:30,625 --> 01:40:33,541
I'm gonna call it a "croissant souff-hey."

2217
01:40:33,625 --> 01:40:34,958
Dad, stop.

2218
01:40:35,041 --> 01:40:36,916
-Guys, that's so bad.
-All right, everybody.

2219
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,750
Well, since you're all such critics,
what do you think of this?

2220
01:40:39,833 --> 01:40:41,166
-[Zoey] This is amazing.
-What is that?

2221
01:40:41,250 --> 01:40:43,458
-[Paul] With a new label.
-[Ella] It's us.

2222
01:40:43,541 --> 01:40:45,875
-[Paul] Sit down.
-[Zoey] When did you get the time?

2223
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:47,666
It's us. We look so cute.

2224
01:40:47,750 --> 01:40:49,708
-I'm on here?
-Of course you are.

2225
01:40:49,791 --> 01:40:51,500
-You're part of the family.
-That's so cool.

2226
01:40:51,583 --> 01:40:52,750
Dude, this is dope.

2227
01:40:52,833 --> 01:40:54,000
There's two of me.

2228
01:40:54,083 --> 01:40:56,375
-One of them is me.
-There's two of us?

2229
01:40:56,458 --> 01:40:58,041
[laughing]

2230
01:40:58,125 --> 01:41:02,000
All right,
who wants some more croissant souff-hey?

2231
01:41:02,083 --> 01:41:03,666
-[laughs]
-[children cheering]

2232
01:41:03,750 --> 01:41:06,458
-Right? That's what it is.
-[Paul] Now you guys like it?

2233
01:41:06,541 --> 01:41:09,833
[Paul] So I didn't get my franchise,
but I got something better.

2234
01:41:09,916 --> 01:41:11,166
I got my family

2235
01:41:11,666 --> 01:41:14,708
and a life that's the perfect size
for all of our dreams.

2236
01:41:15,333 --> 01:41:19,791
And at the end of the day,
there is no sweeter dream than that.
