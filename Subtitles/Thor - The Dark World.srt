00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:39,131
<i>Long before the birth of light,
there was darkness.</i>

3
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:43,339
<i>And from that darkness
came the Dark Elves.</i>

4
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,932
<i>Millennia ago,
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith</i>

5
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:53,937
<i>sought to transform our universe
back into one of eternal night.</i>

6
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:01,111
<i>Such evil was possible
through the power of the Aether,</i>

7
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,986
<i>an ancient force of infinite destruction.</i>

8
00:01:08,058 --> 00:01:09,443
Malekith.

9
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,162
Asgard's forces are upon us.

10
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,880
<i>The noble armies of Asgard,
led by my father, King Bor,</i>

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,924
<i>waged a mighty war
against these creatures.</i>

12
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,187
Send in the Kursed!

13
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,868
<i>As the Nine Worlds
converged above him,</i>

14
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:04,340
<i>Malekith could at last
unleash the Aether.</i>

15
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,647
Ahh!

16
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,729
<i>But Asgard ripped
the weapon from his grasp.</i>

17
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:28,944
<i>Without it, the Dark Elves fell.</i>

18
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,423
<i>With the battle all but lost,</i>

19
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,085
<i>Malekith sacrificed his own people</i>

20
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:52,968
<i>in a desperate attempt
to lay waste to Asgard's army.</i>

21
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,144
Their deaths will mean our survival.

22
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,598
This war is far from over.

23
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,828
<i>Malekith was vanquished,
and the Aether was no more.</i>

24
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,739
<i>Or so we were led to believe.</i>

25
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,544
Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?

26
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,581
If only we could.

27
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,590
But its power is too great.

28
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,669
Bury it deep.

29
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,217
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

30
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,051
Loki.

31
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:17,764
Hello, Mother.

32
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,138
Have I made you proud?

33
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,679
Please, don't make this worse.

34
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,605
Define "worse."

35
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:26,357
Enough!

36
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,814
I will speak to the prisoner alone.

37
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,209
I really don't see
what all the fuss is about.

38
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:48,747
Do you not truly feel
the gravity of your crimes?

39
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,715
Wherever you go, there is war, ruin,

40
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:53,877
and death.

41
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,264
I went down to Midgard to rule the
people of Earth as a benevolent god.

42
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,600
Just like you.

43
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:04,555
We are not gods.
We are born, we live, we die.

44
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,102
Just as humans do.

45
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,435
Give or take 5,000 years.

46
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,356
All this because Loki desires a throne.

47
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:15,865
It is my birthright.

48
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,369
Your birthright was to die

49
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,408
as a Child.

50
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,999
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

51
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:29,128
If I had not taken you in,

52
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,915
you would not be here now to hate me.

53
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,291
If I am for the axe,
then for mercy's sake,

54
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,795
just swing it.

55
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,171
It's not that I don't
love our little talks,

56
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,095
it's just...

57
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,848
I don't love them.

58
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,261
Frigga is the only reason
you're still alive,

59
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,684
and you will never see her again.

60
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,899
You will spend the rest of your days
in the dungeons.

61
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,150
And what of Thor?

62
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:02,370
You'll make that witless oaf king
while I rot in chains.

63
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:06,032
Thor must strive to undo
the damage you have done.

64
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,719
He will bring order to the Nine Realms

65
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,835
and then, yes...

66
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,668
He will be king.

67
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,508
- Ah!

68
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,762
I've got this completely under control!

69
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,969
Is that why everything is on fire?

70
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,939
Ah!

71
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:29,536
You're welcome.

72
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,202
Ha!

73
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,267
All yours.

74
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,870
Hello.

75
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,795
I accept your surrender.

76
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,022
Anyone else?

77
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:46,447
Perhaps next time
we should start with the big one.

78
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,658
Keep moving. Come on!

79
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:03,592
Keep moving. Go ahead of me.
Don't you turn around!

80
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,379
Where do we go next?

81
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,517
Hogun, the peace
is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

82
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,183
You should stay here. Be with
your people, where your heart is.

83
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,938
Asgard can wait.

84
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,316
You have my thanks.

85
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,149
As you have mine.

86
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,950
Heimdall, when you're ready.

87
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,868
Is Vanaheim secure?

88
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,499
As are Nornheim and Ria.

89
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:19,341
Though our work would have gone
more quickly with you at the fore.

90
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:24,378
You must think I'm a piece of bread
that needs to be buttered so heavily.

91
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,626
That was not my intent.

92
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,210
For the first time
since Bifrost was destroyed,

93
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,009
the Nine Realms are at peace.

94
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,595
They're well reminded of our strength

95
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:38,470
and you have earned their respect
and my gratitude.

96
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:39,597
Thank you.

97
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,225
Nothing out of order

98
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,524
except your confused
and distracted heart.

99
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,939
This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.

100
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,996
Human lives are fleeting,
they're nothing.

101
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,189
You'd be better served
by what lies in front of you.

102
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:56,613
I'm telling you this, not as the Allfather,

103
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:57,739
but as your father.

104
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,741
You are ready.

105
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,873
The time has come
for you to take the throne.

106
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,745
Embrace and celebrate
what you've won.

107
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,954
Join your warriors.

108
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:07,424
Eat and drink, revel in their celebration.

109
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:10,886
At least pretend to enjoy yourself.

110
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,132
Another!

111
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,361
There was a time
when you would celebrate for weeks.

112
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,790
I remember you celebrated
the Battle of Harokin

113
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,159
so much that you nearly
started the second.

114
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,828
Well, the first was so much fun.

115
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,341
Take a drink with me.

116
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:37,511
Surely, the Allfather could have
no further task for you tonight.

117
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,516
No, this is one I set myself.

118
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,560
It does not go unnoticed
that you disappear each night.

119
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,932
There are nine realms.

120
00:12:47,099 --> 00:12:50,069
The future king of Asgard
must focus on more than one.

121
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:56,983
I thank you for your sword

122
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:00,113
and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.

123
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:21,592
Hi.

124
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,928
Hi.

125
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,420
So, what's the story with you?

126
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,223
Why does there have to be a story?
There's no story.

127
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,558
You spent the first
ten minutes of our date

128
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,527
hiding behind a menu
that has three choices on it.

129
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,026
It's either chicken,
vegetarian, or fish, Jane.

130
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,240
I think there's a story

131
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,573
and I'm thinking
the story involves a guy.

132
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,580
It's complicated.

133
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,910
Is he still around?

134
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,037
No, he...

135
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,706
Went away.

136
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:49,245
I've been there.

137
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,459
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

138
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,964
I was seeing a woman

139
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,922
and she took a job in New York.

140
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,382
Eventually, the distance killed it.

141
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,931
And the fact
that she kept sleeping with other dudes.

142
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,683
- No!
- Oh, so many.

143
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,846
Hi. Could we get some wine, please?

144
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,059
Sure, I'd love some.

145
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,773
Richard, this is Darcy.

146
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,276
What are you doing here?

147
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,479
Oh. Hello.

148
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,324
So, I show up to work
at the lab/your mom's house,

149
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:23,162
fully expecting you
to be moping around in your pajamas,

150
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,997
eating ice cream and obsessing about...

151
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,322
You know who.

152
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,370
Ah.

153
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:29,914
But you're not.
You're wearing lady clothes.

154
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,628
You even showered, didn't you?
You smell good.

155
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:32,829
Is there a point to all this?

156
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,956
Because there really needs
to be a point to all this.

157
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,174
Right.

158
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,269
You know all that scientific equipment
you don't look at anymore?

159
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,763
You might want
to start looking at it again.

160
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,929
This is the reason
we came all the way out here.

161
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,133
It's malfunctioning.

162
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,135
That's what I said.

163
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,178
That's what I did.

164
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:51,147
I thought you would do something
a little more scientific.

165
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,932
- I'm sure it's nothing.
- Yeah, it's...

166
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,105
It doesn't look like nothing.

167
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,769
It kind of looks like the readings
that Erik was rambling about.

168
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,862
Our friend Erik

169
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,982
kind of went banana balls.

170
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,149
He's not interested.

171
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,151
- I'm not interested.
- I'm interested.

172
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,823
It's time for you to go now.

173
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,287
Okay.

174
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,742
Short but sweet.

175
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,461
She needs help.

176
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,674
I think I'm going to have the sea bass.

177
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,710
Sea bass, yeah. Sea bass is good.

178
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:25,179
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass.

179
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:27,810
Sea bass...

180
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,178
Sea bass.

181
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,679
Jane?

182
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,348
Maybe you should stop
saying "sea bass"

183
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:34,396
and go after your friend.

184
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,518
This was so fun.

185
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,442
I'll just stay here
and say "sea bass" alone.

186
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:48,322
And I hate you.

187
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,082
What? I said he was cute.

188
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:53,284
Just shut up and drive.

189
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,016
You need to take the next left.

190
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,549
- Who's he?
- He's my intern.

191
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,889
- You have an intern?
- Oh, yeah.

192
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,011
Hello, Dr. Foster.

193
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,977
It's such a great honor
to be working with you.

194
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:15,350
Right. I have to call Erik.

195
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,817
Oh, take a right.

196
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,153
And a left.

197
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:25,201
I have totally mastered
driving in London.

198
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,821
Hi, Erik. It's me again. Where are you?

199
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,866
I came here because you said you were
onto something, and then you vanish.

200
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,413
I'm here at Stonehenge

201
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:36,749
for what has been an
interesting unfolding of events today.

202
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:38,663
<i>The police were called to the scene</i>

203
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,248
<i>shortly after 11 A.M. this morning</i>

204
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:43,751
<i>after a seemingly harmless rambler
approached the area</i>

205
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,551
<i>then, decided to strip naked
and effectively</i>

206
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,800
<i>terrorize tourists there
with scientific equipment</i>

207
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,810
<i>whilst shouting
that he was trying to save them.</i>

208
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:56,264
<i>The man, later identified
as noted astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

209
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,893
<i>has been called in
for questioning by police.</i>

210
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,943
Come on, this is exciting.

211
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,232
Look! The intern is excited.

212
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,567
"Ian."

213
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,234
Do you want the phase meter?

214
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,703
- No.
- Bring the phase meter.

215
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,659
The toaster-looking thing.

216
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:14,371
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

217
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,500
How do I change the ring-tone
on this thing?

218
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,544
An astrophysicist with three degrees

219
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,297
should be able
to change her own ring-tone.

220
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,964
Why are you calling me?

221
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,300
I didn't want to shout.
Intern says it's this way.

222
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,349
- "Ian." My name is Ian.
- Shh.

223
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:51,533
I am not getting stabbed
in the name of science.

224
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:53,237
It's okay, we're Americans.

225
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,281
Is that supposed to make them like us?

226
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,034
- They'll make it go away.
- Shh.

227
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,962
Oh, they're kids.

228
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:02,414
Are you the police?

229
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,759
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

230
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,135
Thanks.

231
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,925
We just found it.

232
00:18:11,131 --> 00:18:12,348
Can you show us?

233
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,329
That doesn't seem right.

234
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,392
Where'd it go?

235
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:13,944
That's...

236
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:15,620
That's incredible!

237
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,756
What happened?

238
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:32,296
Sometimes they come back.

239
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,010
Sometimes they don't.

240
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,180
I want to throw something!

241
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,428
Jane, give me your shoe.

242
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,228
I haven't seen readings like this since...

243
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,851
Since...

244
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:46,977
New Mexico?

245
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,446
Don't touch anything!

246
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,788
Give me your shoe.

247
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,627
Oh.

248
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,311
Were those the car keys?

249
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,167
Whoa. Ah!

250
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:54,670
Oh!

251
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,008
Darcy!

252
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,223
Oh!

253
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,299
The Aether awakens us.

254
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:06,935
The Convergence returns.

255
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,323
You're late.

256
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,657
Merriment can sometimes
be a heavier burden than battle.

257
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,463
Then you're doing
one of them incorrectly.

258
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,165
Perhaps.

259
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,170
How fare the stars?

260
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:36,002
Still shining.

261
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,963
From here, I can see
nine realms and ten trillion souls.

262
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,592
Do you recall
what I taught you of the Convergence?

263
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:47,850
Yes.

264
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,346
The alignment of the worlds.

265
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,230
It approaches, doesn't it?

266
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:56,352
The universe hasn't seen this marvel
since before my watch began.

267
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,614
Few can sense it. Even fewer can see it.

268
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,572
But while its effects can be dangerous,

269
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:08,246
it is truly beautiful.

270
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:11,073
I see nothing.

271
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:14,704
Or, perhaps,
that is not the beauty you seek.

272
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:21,885
How is she?

273
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,966
She's quite clever,
your mortal.

274
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,421
She doesn't know it yet,

275
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,925
but she studies
the Convergence as well.

276
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,308
Even...

277
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,474
What?

278
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,729
I can't see her.

279
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,733
Jane!

280
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,606
Where the hell were you?

281
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,436
Tell me you didn't call the police.

282
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,563
What was I supposed to do?

283
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:25,564
- Not call the police.
- I was freaking out.

284
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:26,857
You call the cops, they call the Feds.

285
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,781
Next thing you know,
we have S.H.I.E.L.D. crawling all over

286
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,528
- "Area 51-ing" the place.
- Jane.

287
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,696
We had a stable gravitation anomaly.

288
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,994
We had unimpeded access.

289
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:36,622
Our only competition was ten years old!

290
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,332
Jane! You were gone for five hours.

291
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,122
What?

292
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,635
That's weird.

293
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,615
Typical.

294
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,409
Jane.

295
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:18,827
Sorry. I just needed
to make sure you were real.

296
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:20,496
It's been a very strange day.

297
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,164
I am. Jane, what...

298
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:23,628
Where were you?

299
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:24,833
Where were you?

300
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,093
Heimdall cannot see you.

301
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,004
I was right here where you left me.

302
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,348
I was waiting, and then I was crying

303
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,011
and then I went out looking for you.

304
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,721
You said you were coming back.

305
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:37,228
I know. I know,
but the Bifrost was destroyed.

306
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,934
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos.

307
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,228
Wars were raging,
marauders were pillaging.

308
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:43,393
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

309
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:48,814
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

310
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:51,659
But I saw you on TV.
You were in New York!

311
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,362
Jane, I fought to protect you
from the dangers of my world

312
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,161
but I was wrong.

313
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,201
I was a fool.

314
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:03,546
But I believe
that fate brought us together.

315
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,673
Jane, I don't know where you were,
or what happened, but I do know this...

316
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:10,503
What?

317
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,802
I know...

318
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,133
You do?

319
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,727
Do what?

320
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:19,471
What?

321
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,056
Hey!

322
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,275
Is this you?

323
00:27:28,497 --> 00:27:30,481
Uh, we're kind of
in the middle of something here.

324
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,156
Um, I'm pretty sure
we are getting arrested.

325
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,402
Hold that thought.

326
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,490
Look at you,
still all muscly and everything.

327
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,241
How's space?

328
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:43,370
Space is fine.

329
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,747
Excuse me.

330
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,080
- Are you Jane Foster?
- Yes.

331
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,082
Do you know this man?

332
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,751
He's my intern.

333
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:52,091
My intern's intern.

334
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,296
This is private property
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

335
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:55,594
You'll have to come with me.

336
00:28:01,388 --> 00:28:02,389
Jane.

337
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,149
- Jane.
- Thor?

338
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,476
Are you all right?

339
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,857
What just happened?

340
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,021
Place your hands
on your heads. Step back.

341
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,147
This woman is unwell.

342
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,149
She's dangerous.

343
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,493
So am I.

344
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:18,614
Requesting armed response officers
to scene.

345
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,615
- Hold on to me.
- What are you doing?

346
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,005
Holy shit.

347
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,534
We have to do that again.

348
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:01,990
Hi.

349
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,999
Welcome to Asgard.

350
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,027
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

351
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,232
I can barely remember a time
before the light.

352
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:39,156
Our survival will be your legacy.

353
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,865
The Asgardians will suffer
as we have suffered.

354
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:46,200
I will reclaim the Aether.

355
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,534
I will restore our world.

356
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,254
And I will put an end
to this poisoned universe.

357
00:29:58,546 --> 00:29:59,630
What's that?

358
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,678
Be still.

359
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,601
This is not of Earth. What is it?

360
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,065
We do not know.

361
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,741
But she will not survive the
amount of energy surging within her.

362
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,959
That's a quantum field generator,
isn't it?

363
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,416
It's a soul forge.

364
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:30,754
Does a soul forge transfer molecular
energy from one place to another?

365
00:30:33,623 --> 00:30:34,670
Yes.

366
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:36,543
Quantum field generator.

367
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,593
My words are mere noises to you
that you ignore them completely?

368
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:41,881
She is ill.

369
00:30:42,006 --> 00:30:44,259
She is mortal.

370
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:45,972
Illness is their defining trait.

371
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,803
I brought her here
because we can help her.

372
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,727
She does not belong here in Asgard

373
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,268
any more than a goat
belongs at a banquet table.

374
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,102
Did he just...

375
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,770
Who do you think you are?

376
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,320
I am Odin, King of Asgard.

377
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,029
Protector of the Nine Realms.

378
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,778
Oh. Well, I'm...

379
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,789
I know very well who you are,
Jane Foster.

380
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,117
You told your dad about me?

381
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,461
Something is within her, Father.

382
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:12,911
Something I have not seen before.

383
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,129
Her world has its healers.

384
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,167
They are called "doctors."
Let them deal with it.

385
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,089
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

386
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,044
No, I would not...

387
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:23,889
...touch her.

388
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,304
Jane, are you all right?

389
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,968
Yeah.

390
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,932
It's impossible.

391
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,894
The infection... It's defending her.

392
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,816
No.

393
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:39,986
It's defending itself.

394
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,026
Come with me.

395
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:46,951
There are relics
that pre-date the universe itself.

396
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:50,993
What lies within her
appears to be one of them.

397
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,496
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

398
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:55,834
They had a dawn

399
00:31:55,997 --> 00:31:57,169
as they will have a dusk.

400
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,500
But before that dawn

401
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:06,016
the dark forces, the Dark Elves,
reigned absolute and unchallenged.

402
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,264
"Born of eternal night

403
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,229
the Dark Elves come
to steal away the light."

404
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,183
I know these stories.
Mother told them to us as children.

405
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,519
Their leader Malekith made a weapon
out of that darkness

406
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,188
and it was called the Aether.

407
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,316
While the other relics
often appear as stones

408
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,991
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

409
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,747
It changes matter into dark matter.

410
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:33,459
It seeks out host bodies,
drawing strength from their life-force.

411
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,672
Malekith sought to use
the Aether's power

412
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,585
to return the universe
to one of darkness.

413
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,962
But, after eternities of bloodshed

414
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,557
my father Bor finally triumphed

415
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:52,221
ushering in a peace
that lasted thousands of years.

416
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,393
What happened?

417
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,605
He killed them all.

418
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,977
Are you certain?

419
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,062
The Aether was said to have
been destroyed with them,

420
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,315
and yet here it is.

421
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,905
The Dark Elves are dead.

422
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:11,113
Does your book happen to mention
how to get it out of me?

423
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,115
No.

424
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:14,743
It does not.

425
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:27,464
The worlds are nearly aligned.

426
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,637
You will be the last of the Kursed.

427
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,432
Let my life be sacrificed.

428
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:41,110
It is no less than our people did.

429
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,941
Or you have done.

430
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,705
You will become darkness.

431
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:57,627
Cursed to this existence
until it consumes you.

432
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,754
Until then. no power our enemies
possess can stop you.

433
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,643
I will tear down their defenses and
ensure your return to a universe reborn.

434
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,872
Acting as caretakers to these
scoundrels is beneath us.

435
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:44,206
Oh, please!
If they were beneath you,

436
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,335
my rotund friend, they'd all be dead.

437
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,017
- Keep in line!
- Move it!

438
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:08,194
Odin continues to
bring me new friends.

439
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,316
How thoughtful.

440
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:14,036
The books I sent,
do they not interest you?

441
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,906
Is that how I am to while away eternity?
Reading?

442
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,118
I've done everything in my power
to make you comfortable, Loki.

443
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,166
Have you?

444
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:25,047
Does Odin share your concern?

445
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,046
Does Thor?

446
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:31,920
It must be so inconvenient,
them asking after me day and night.

447
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:35,050
You know full well it was your actions
that brought you here.

448
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,934
My actions?

449
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:40,428
I was merely giving truth to the lie
that I had been fed my entire life...

450
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:42,180
That I was born to be a king.

451
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,224
A king?

452
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,227
A true king admits his faults.

453
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:47,792
What of the lives you took on Earth?

454
00:35:47,937 --> 00:35:49,604
A mere handful
compared to the number

455
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,403
that Odin has taken himself.

456
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,240
- Your father...
- He's not my father!

457
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,332
Then am I not your mother?

458
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,505
You're not.

459
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:15,265
You're always so perceptive
about everyone but yourself.

460
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,612
When you came for me,
you knew I was in trouble.

461
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,985
Heimdall had lost sight of you.

462
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,782
You were no longer on Earth.

463
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,241
How is that possible?

464
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:40,488
I believe you were and you weren't.

465
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:43,368
The Nine Realms
travel within Yggdrasil

466
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,913
orbiting Midgard much the way
your planets orbit the sun.

467
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:51,291
And every 5,000 years,
the worlds align perfectly

468
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,511
and we call this the Convergence.

469
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,305
During this time, the borders
between worlds become blurred.

470
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,766
It's possible
you found one of these points.

471
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:07,024
We are lucky that it remained open.

472
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:11,438
Once the worlds pass out of alignment

473
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:14,903
then the connection is lost.

474
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,040
I like the way you explain things.

475
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,710
What's going to happen to me?

476
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,469
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

477
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,802
- Your father said there was...
- My father doesn't know everything.

478
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:40,679
Don't let him hear you say that.

479
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,426
Jane Foster...

480
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,844
Please meet Frigga,

481
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,768
Queen of Asgard, and my mother.

482
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,985
Hi.

483
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,531
Move!

484
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,367
To the dungeons!

485
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,743
Come on!

486
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,981
You might want to take
the stairs to the left.

487
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,373
The prisons.

488
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:11,330
- Loki...
- Go.

489
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,335
I will look after her.

490
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,356
It's as if they resent being imprisoned!

491
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:33,188
There's no pleasing some creatures.

492
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,349
Return to your cells,
no further harm will come to you.

493
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:44,696
You have my word.

494
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,871
Very well, you do not have my word.

495
00:40:58,747 --> 00:41:00,749
Send a squadron
to the weapons vault.

496
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,424
Defend it at all costs.
Secure the dungeon.

497
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,179
- Odin.
- Frigga.

498
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:07,047
Go!

499
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,092
It's a skirmish.

500
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:10,467
Nothing to fear.

501
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:11,970
You've never been a very good liar.

502
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:14,053
Take her to your chambers.

503
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:15,931
I'll come for you when it's safe.

504
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:17,640
You take care.

505
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,762
Despite all I have survived,

506
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,279
my queen still worries over me.

507
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:23,606
It's only because I worry over you

508
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,574
that you have survived.

509
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,285
Listen to me now.

510
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:32,415
I need you to do everything I ask,
no questions.

511
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,703
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,912
Oh!

513
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,662
- Ow!
- Ah!

514
00:46:43,258 --> 00:46:46,387
The throne of Asgard
is destroyed! To the king!

515
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,195
Frigga

516
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,418
Stand down, creature,

517
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:16,290
and you may still survive this.

518
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:18,385
I have survived worse, woman.

519
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,214
Who are you?

520
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,803
I am Malekith.

521
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,594
And I would have what is mine.

522
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,857
Ah!

523
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,422
You have taken something, child.

524
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,507
Give it back.

525
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,985
Witch!

526
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,191
Where is the Aether?

527
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,614
I'll never tell you.

528
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,828
I believe you.

529
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,496
No!

530
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,413
<i>The universe rotates
on a 5,000 year cycle</i>

531
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,662
and once a cycle, all the worlds align.

532
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:07,253
Imagine... Imagine that this is our world.

533
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,047
Oh, thank you. And this is another world.

534
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,178
Normally, they're separate.

535
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:14,130
But during the Alignment,

536
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:17,681
everything is connected,
all nine realms.

537
00:52:17,843 --> 00:52:20,094
All nine realms
are passing through each other

538
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,439
and gravity, light, and even matter,

539
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,145
is crashing from one world to the other.

540
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,480
But if this happens to us now,
the result will be cataclysmic.

541
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:35,987
My gravimetric spikes can stabilize
the focal point of the Convergence.

542
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,071
This time, the Alignment

543
00:52:39,072 --> 00:52:42,076
and all the other worlds
would just pass us by.

544
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:43,744
It's beautiful.

545
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:47,418
It's simple. Any questions?

546
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,589
Yeah.

547
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:54,762
Can I have my shoe back?

548
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:06,517
Heal. You will need your strength
to reclaim the Aether.

549
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:10,612
And when you wake,
we will kill them all.

550
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:47,478
Jane Foster?

551
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,315
You need to come with us.

552
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,657
We are still unable to restore
the palace shields.

553
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,196
Our artillery cannot detect them.

554
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,115
Even Heimdall cannot see them.

555
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:06,414
My king, we are all but defenseless.

556
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,463
She's your prisoner now?

557
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:14,175
Leave us.

558
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:25,349
I do not wish to fight with you.

559
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:27,680
Nor I with you.

560
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:29,524
But I intend to pursue Malekith.

561
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:30,980
We possess the Aether.

562
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,860
Malekith will come to us.

563
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,104
Yes, and he will destroy us.

564
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,233
You overestimate
the power of these creatures.

565
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,701
No, I value our people's lives.

566
00:54:39,859 --> 00:54:43,159
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,
and draw the enemy away from Asgard.

567
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,198
When Malekith
pulls the Aether from Jane,

568
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,201
it will be exposed and vulnerable.

569
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,166
And I will destroy it and him.

570
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:55,040
If you fail, you risk this weapon

571
00:54:55,041 --> 00:54:56,884
falling into the hands of our enemies.

572
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:59,380
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

573
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,472
His ship could be over our heads
right now,

574
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:02,890
we would never even know it.

575
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,300
If and when he comes

576
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:08,554
his men will fall
on 10,000 Asgardian blades.

577
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,977
And how many of our men
shall fall on theirs?

578
00:55:10,098 --> 00:55:12,066
As many as are needed!

579
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:16,237
Ah!

580
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,573
We will fight!

581
00:55:25,071 --> 00:55:27,620
Till the last Asgardian breath.

582
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:31,457
Till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

583
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:36,709
Then how are you different
from Malekith?

584
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:42,513
The difference, my son, is that I will win.

585
00:55:56,811 --> 00:55:59,610
Jane isn't calling me back,
Erik isn't calling me back,

586
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:01,654
stupid S.H.I.E.L.D.
isn't calling me back.

587
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,692
- What's S.H.I.E.L.D?
- It's a secret.

588
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,616
Hey, Erik, it's Darcy again.

589
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:08,536
Thor came back,
he took Jane to Asgard,

590
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:12,326
and I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to do.

591
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,328
<i>Something else
went missing this week</i>

592
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:17,458
<i>when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig</i>

593
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:21,132
<i>notable for his involvement
in the alien invasion of New York</i>

594
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,591
<i>streaked nude across...</i>

595
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,303
Darcy,
you really need to look at this.

596
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:26,715
Your friend, Erik...

597
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,468
What was his last name again?

598
00:56:29,427 --> 00:56:32,806
<i>And began shouting at visitors
to the historic site.</i>

599
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:35,020
<i>He was later taken into police custody</i>

600
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:37,940
<i>for psychiatric evaluation.</i>

601
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:40,151
<i>Police are still refusing to confirm...</i>

602
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:52,705
You were not at Odin's war council.

603
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,170
The Bifrost is closed
by your father's orders.

604
00:56:55,370 --> 00:56:56,745
No one is to come

605
00:56:56,746 --> 00:56:58,043
or to go.

606
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,844
We face an enemy
that is invisible even to me.

607
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:06,723
What use is a guardian such as that?

608
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:10,927
Malekith will return, you know this.

609
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:14,518
I need your help.

610
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,735
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.
Not even for you.

611
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:20,479
I'm not asking you to.

612
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,031
The realms need their Allfather strong
and unchallenged

613
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:25,738
whether he is or not.

614
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,693
But he is blinded, Heimdall

615
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,528
by hatred and by grief.

616
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,280
As are we all.

617
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:32,573
I see clearly enough.

618
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,201
The risks are too great.

619
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:37,211
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

620
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:39,088
There is no other way.

621
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,261
What do you require of me?

622
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,928
<i>What I'm about to ask of you
is treason of the highest order.</i>

623
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:53,265
<i>Success will bring us exile
and failure shall mean our death.</i>

624
00:57:56,139 --> 00:58:00,235
<i>Malekith knew the Aether was here.
He can sense its power.</i>

625
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,941
<i>If we do nothing,
he will come for it again</i>

626
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:07,234
<i>but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.</i>

627
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:10,236
We must move Jane off-world.

628
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:12,076
The Bifrost has been shut down

629
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:13,915
and the Tesseract
locked away in the vault.

630
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:18,285
There are other paths off Asgard.
Ways known only to a few.

631
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:20,209
One, actually.

632
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,042
No.

633
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:31,757
Thor. After all this time

634
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,432
and now you come to visit me.

635
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,934
Why?

636
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:41,313
Have you come to gloat? To mock?

637
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,061
Loki, enough.

638
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,321
No more illusions.

639
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:54,581
Now you see me, brother.

640
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:05,007
Did she suffer?

641
00:59:05,124 --> 00:59:07,468
I did not come here to share our grief.

642
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:10,680
Instead I offer you the chance
of a far richer sacrament.

643
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,307
Go on.

644
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,218
I know you seek vengeance
as much as I do.

645
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,189
You help me escape Asgard
and I will grant it to you.

646
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,849
Vengeance

647
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,438
and afterward, this cell.

648
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:34,992
You must be truly desperate
to come to me for help.

649
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,323
What makes you think
you can trust me?

650
00:59:38,324 --> 00:59:39,746
I don't

651
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,544
Mother did.

652
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,333
But you should know that when
we fought each other in the past,

653
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,709
I did so with a glimmer of hope

654
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,587
that my brother
was still in there somewhere.

655
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:54,682
That hope no longer exists
to protect you.

656
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:58,887
You betray me, and I will kill you.

657
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,899
Hmm.

658
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,184
When do we start?

659
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:07,603
He will betray you.

660
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:09,231
He will try.

661
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:16,196
This is so unlike you, brother.

662
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,364
So clandestine.

663
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,730
Are you sure you wouldn't
rather just punch your way out?

664
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,369
If you keep speaking, I just might.

665
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,337
Fine. As you wish.

666
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,877
I'm not even here.

667
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,709
Is this better?

668
01:00:29,876 --> 01:00:32,379
It's better company at least.

669
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:36,428
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

670
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:40,353
Mmm, brother, you look ravishing.

671
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,896
It will hurt no less
when I kill you in this form.

672
01:00:45,058 --> 01:00:48,232
Very well. Perhaps you
prefer one of your new companions

673
01:00:48,394 --> 01:00:50,442
given that you seem
to like them so much.

674
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:53,106
Oh, this is much better.

675
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,108
Ooh.

676
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:57,070
The costume is a bit much. So tight.

677
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,533
But the confidence...

678
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,119
I can feel the righteousness surging.

679
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,751
Hey, do you want to have
a rousing discussion about truth?

680
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:05,494
Honor? Patriotism?

681
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:06,496
God bless Amer...

682
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,550
What?

683
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:17,424
You could at least
furnish me with a weapon.

684
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:19,467
My dagger, something.

685
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:26,306
At last.

686
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,025
A little common sense.

687
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,775
And I thought you liked tricks.

688
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:41,327
Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is
being guarded by a legion of Einherjar

689
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,323
who will see you coming
from miles away.

690
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,042
I won't be the one who comes for her.

691
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:53,835
I'm not hungry.

692
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:56,461
What the...

693
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,715
Good. Let's go.

694
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:05,142
You're...

695
01:02:05,304 --> 01:02:07,347
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

696
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:09,975
That was for New York.

697
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,353
I like her.

698
01:02:11,477 --> 01:02:13,150
<i>And what of the Allfather?</i>

699
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:17,534
It is my sworn duty to notify him
of crimes against the throne.

700
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:21,280
You called me here on an urgent matter.

701
01:02:22,321 --> 01:02:23,322
What is it?

702
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:25,157
Treason, my lord.

703
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,501
Whose?

704
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,248
Mine.

705
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:30,579
My king!

706
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:32,582
The mortal has been taken.

707
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,544
Stop Thor.

708
01:02:37,545 --> 01:02:39,673
By any means necessary.

709
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:44,886
There they are! Take them.

710
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,052
On my command.

711
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:48,272
I'll hold them off. Take her.

712
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:50,312
Thank you.

713
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:55,353
Betray him, and I'll kill you.

714
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,117
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

715
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:10,044
Assuming you can get Loki's help
and you can free this mortal

716
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:11,745
what good would it do?

717
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,706
We'd all be dead the minute
we step one foot outside the palace.

718
01:03:14,707 --> 01:03:17,927
That, my friend,
is why we won't be leaving by foot.

719
01:03:22,048 --> 01:03:23,882
I will give you as much time as I can.

720
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,726
Thank you, my friend.

721
01:03:29,889 --> 01:03:33,063
If you even think about betraying him...

722
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:34,893
You'll kill me?

723
01:03:34,894 --> 01:03:36,896
Evidently, there will be a line.

724
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,297
I thought you said
you knew how to fly this thing.

725
01:03:54,455 --> 01:03:56,331
I said, "How hard could it be?"

726
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:00,628
They're on the ship!

727
01:04:01,462 --> 01:04:02,759
Get to the ship!

728
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,135
Well, whatever you're doing, brother,
I suggest you do it faster.

729
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,514
Shut up, Loki.

730
01:04:12,626 --> 01:04:13,890
You must have missed something.

731
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:16,685
No, I didn't.
I'm pressing every button on this thing.

732
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,279
No, don't hit it. Just press it gently.

733
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:20,239
I'm pressing it gently, it's not working!

734
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:24,360
Ha, ha!

735
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,582
Get him! Get him!

736
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,647
- I think you missed a column.
- Shut up!

737
01:05:07,533 --> 01:05:09,237
Look,
why don't you let me take over?

738
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,490
I'm clearly the better pilot.

739
01:05:10,781 --> 01:05:12,704
Is that right? Well, out of the two of us,

740
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:14,327
which one can actually fly?

741
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:26,504
Oh, dear. Is she dead?

742
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,506
Jane.

743
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:29,300
I'm okay.

744
01:05:31,260 --> 01:05:32,432
Ah!

745
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:37,775
Not a word.

746
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,271
Now they're following us.

747
01:05:46,651 --> 01:05:47,777
Now they're firing at us.

748
01:05:47,944 --> 01:05:49,361
Yeah, thank you
for the commentary, Loki,

749
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:50,705
it's not at all distracting!

750
01:05:55,242 --> 01:05:57,870
Well done.
You just decapitated your grandfather.

751
01:06:09,298 --> 01:06:10,641
You know, this is wonderful.

752
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:13,056
This is a tremendous idea.

753
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:16,314
Let's steal the biggest,
most obvious ship in the universe

754
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,806
and escape in that.

755
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,057
Flying around the city,

756
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:21,436
smashing into everything in sight
so everyone can see us.

757
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,280
It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant!

758
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:39,494
I see your time in the dungeons

759
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:42,089
has made you no less graceful, Loki.

760
01:06:46,293 --> 01:06:48,261
You lied to me.

761
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,964
I'm impressed.

762
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,507
I'm glad you're pleased.

763
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:53,591
Now, do as you promised.

764
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,435
And take us to your secret pathway.

765
01:07:18,659 --> 01:07:20,206
- Fandral.
- Right.

766
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:24,915
For Asgard.

767
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,638
Nothing personal, boys.

768
01:07:46,937 --> 01:07:48,396
Loki...

769
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:51,816
If it were easy, everyone would do it.

770
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:53,819
- Are you mad?
- Possibly.

771
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:11,011
Ta-da!

772
01:08:16,550 --> 01:08:19,895
We must strike now.

773
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:21,931
No.

774
01:08:23,557 --> 01:08:29,189
Asgard is meaningless.

775
01:08:33,400 --> 01:08:35,323
The Aether has found its way home.

776
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:54,671
What I could do with the power
that flows through those veins.

777
01:08:54,672 --> 01:08:57,346
It would consume you.

778
01:08:58,300 --> 01:08:59,893
She's holding up all right.

779
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:01,845
For now.

780
01:09:02,388 --> 01:09:04,937
She's strong in ways
you'd never even know.

781
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:06,474
Say goodbye.

782
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:08,273
Not this day.

783
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:11,193
This day, the next,
a hundred years, it's nothing.

784
01:09:12,439 --> 01:09:13,986
It's a heartbeat.

785
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,402
You'll never be ready.

786
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,403
The only woman
whose love you've prized

787
01:09:18,404 --> 01:09:20,280
will be snatched from you.

788
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:21,578
And will that satisfy you?

789
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,324
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

790
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:25,544
Surrender is not in mine.

791
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:27,912
- The son of Odin...
- No.

792
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:29,961
Not just of Odin.

793
01:09:30,082 --> 01:09:32,426
You think you alone
were loved of Mother?

794
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:34,587
You had her tricks, but I had her trust.

795
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,009
Trust?

796
01:09:36,922 --> 01:09:38,424
Was that her last expression?

797
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:41,268
Trust? When you let her die?

798
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:44,179
- What help were you in your cell?
- Who put me there?

799
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,602
Who put me there?

800
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:46,724
You know damn well!

801
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:49,185
You know damn well who!

802
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:58,115
She wouldn't want us to fight.

803
01:09:59,236 --> 01:10:01,785
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

804
01:10:06,493 --> 01:10:08,996
I wish I could trust you.

805
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:25,478
Trust my rage.

806
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:35,023
You'll have to sign
for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig.

807
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:36,861
What?

808
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,399
Oh, yeah.

809
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,404
My father, Dr. Erik Selvig.

810
01:10:43,113 --> 01:10:45,573
One man's leather wallet, brown.

811
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:48,043
One key ring, three keys.

812
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,083
Prescription medicine...

813
01:10:50,829 --> 01:10:52,081
Various.

814
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,502
- And...
- Erik.

815
01:10:58,087 --> 01:10:59,587
- These.
- Yeah.

816
01:10:59,588 --> 01:11:00,805
Those.

817
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:02,595
Thank goodness.

818
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,477
Erik.

819
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,389
Yes?

820
01:11:08,514 --> 01:11:10,187
It's, uh, Darcy.

821
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,399
Darcy.

822
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,400
So good to see you.

823
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,568
Oh, I missed you, too.

824
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,189
How did you find me?

825
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:19,442
You were naked on TV.

826
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,946
Okay, time to go, lots to do.

827
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:27,032
Getting weird now.

828
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,578
I should not be left in charge
of stuff like this.

829
01:11:30,703 --> 01:11:34,622
I don't get paid enough.
I don't get paid, period.

830
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,627
I'm Ian by the way, uh, Darcy's intern.

831
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,966
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

832
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,306
Are you all right?

833
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,307
I've had a god in my brain.

834
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,102
I don't recommend it.

835
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:51,097
Dr. Selvig, sir,
your gear is beeping at me.

836
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:53,476
It's happening.
It's sooner than I calculated.

837
01:11:53,642 --> 01:11:55,269
Wait. What's happening?

838
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:00,237
Birds?

839
01:12:00,357 --> 01:12:01,816
Birds are happening?

840
01:12:01,817 --> 01:12:04,070
They're starlings.
It's called a murmuration.

841
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:06,409
My dad, he used to take me
bird watching as a kid.

842
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,074
- Nerd.
- Look!

843
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:14,834
Where did they go?

844
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,932
What the hell was that?

845
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,102
Why are you smiling?

846
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:33,556
There's nothing more reassuring

847
01:12:33,557 --> 01:12:37,352
than realizing that the world
is crazier than you are.

848
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:40,232
Take me to Jane's lab.

849
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:54,169
Jane.

850
01:13:00,793 --> 01:13:02,136
Malekith.

851
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,323
All right. Are you ready?

852
01:13:26,485 --> 01:13:27,737
I am.

853
01:13:41,316 --> 01:13:43,501
You know, this plan of yours
is going to get us killed.

854
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,379
Yes, possibly.

855
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,368
You still don't trust me, brother?

856
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:53,141
Would you?

857
01:14:02,062 --> 01:14:03,279
No, I wouldn't.

858
01:14:08,068 --> 01:14:09,536
Thor!

859
01:14:10,362 --> 01:14:11,955
No!

860
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:23,791
You really think I cared about Frigga?

861
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,510
About any of you?

862
01:14:28,505 --> 01:14:29,506
All I ever wanted

863
01:14:31,008 --> 01:14:32,055
was you and Odin

864
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:33,268
dead at my feet!

865
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:46,899
Malekith!

866
01:14:48,984 --> 01:14:50,986
I am Loki of Jotunheim,

867
01:14:51,153 --> 01:14:53,076
and I bring you a gift.

868
01:14:55,032 --> 01:14:56,949
I ask only one thing in return...

869
01:14:56,950 --> 01:14:58,826
A good seat from which

870
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:00,827
to watch Asgard burn.

871
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,331
He is an enemy of Asgard.

872
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:06,085
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.

873
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,433
Look at me.

874
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:20,951
Loki! Now!

875
01:17:41,365 --> 01:17:42,582
Ah!

876
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:37,796
Ah!

877
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,406
- Ah!
- No!

878
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,784
See you in hell, monster.

879
01:20:07,636 --> 01:20:09,104
No. No, no, no.

880
01:20:11,431 --> 01:20:13,766
Oh, you fool, you didn't listen.

881
01:20:13,767 --> 01:20:14,768
I know...

882
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,062
I'm a fool, I'm a fool.

883
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,313
Stay with me, okay?

884
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:20,486
I'm sorry.

885
01:20:22,526 --> 01:20:24,745
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Shh...

886
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:26,158
It's okay.

887
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,285
It's all right.

888
01:20:31,409 --> 01:20:34,913
I'll tell Father what you did here today.

889
01:20:37,999 --> 01:20:40,923
I didn't do it for him.

890
01:20:49,469 --> 01:20:51,847
No!

891
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,698
He's going to unleash it.

892
01:21:47,819 --> 01:21:52,996
Not just on Asgard, or on a star.
Malekith is going to destroy everything.

893
01:21:53,116 --> 01:21:54,242
How?

894
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:56,499
Jane, how?

895
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,840
I saw him on Earth.
Why would he go to Earth?

896
01:22:00,415 --> 01:22:01,792
The Convergence.

897
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:03,208
Oh, God.

898
01:22:03,209 --> 01:22:05,649
None of this would have happened
if I hadn't found the Aether.

899
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:08,173
Then Malekith
would've only possessed it

900
01:22:08,298 --> 01:22:10,049
that much sooner.

901
01:22:10,050 --> 01:22:12,519
I only found it
because I was looking for you.

902
01:22:13,136 --> 01:22:14,388
Jane...

903
01:22:16,014 --> 01:22:17,732
Now we're trapped here.

904
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:25,489
It's not me.

905
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:27,992
Hello?

906
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,326
<i>Hi, Jane, it's Richard.</i>

907
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:31,238
Richard? Where are you?

908
01:22:31,363 --> 01:22:32,580
I'm still at the office.

909
01:22:32,697 --> 01:22:34,740
It's been a crazy day here today.

910
01:22:34,741 --> 01:22:36,664
- Oh, my God, this is amazing.
<i>- Is it?</i>

911
01:22:36,785 --> 01:22:38,077
<i>I quite enjoyed our lunch</i>

912
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,245
despite never actually
ordering anything.

913
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:41,747
How am I getting service here?

914
01:22:41,748 --> 01:22:43,876
<i>Is this a bad time?
Do you want me to try you later?</i>

915
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:47,174
No, no, no. Please, whatever
you do, do not hang up the phone.

916
01:22:48,046 --> 01:22:49,254
Okay, then.

917
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:51,715
<i>I was just wondering
if you want to try again.</i>

918
01:22:51,716 --> 01:22:53,258
<i>Uh, maybe dinner next time.</i>

919
01:22:53,259 --> 01:22:54,886
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

920
01:22:55,011 --> 01:22:57,264
<i>- Just stay on the phone, okay?</i>
- Yeah, I will.

921
01:22:57,389 --> 01:22:59,357
Oh, my God.

922
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:04,395
Am I interrupting something?

923
01:23:04,396 --> 01:23:06,114
No, no, no. Nothing at all.

924
01:23:06,272 --> 01:23:07,356
Come on.

925
01:23:07,357 --> 01:23:08,449
<i>I'm losing you there.
Are you in a tunnel?</i>

926
01:23:08,608 --> 01:23:10,109
Where are we going?

927
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,111
<i>Hello?</i>

928
01:23:11,236 --> 01:23:13,079
Why are there so many shoes in here?

929
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,499
I'll just text her.

930
01:23:28,795 --> 01:23:29,967
So, who's Richard?

931
01:23:30,130 --> 01:23:31,598
Really?

932
01:23:39,931 --> 01:23:41,473
- Jane!
- Hey.

933
01:23:41,474 --> 01:23:43,308
You can't just leave like that.

934
01:23:43,309 --> 01:23:44,606
The whole world is going crazy.

935
01:23:44,769 --> 01:23:46,612
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

936
01:23:48,106 --> 01:23:49,949
- Did you go to a party?
- Erik?

937
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:53,741
Jane! How wonderful.

938
01:23:54,612 --> 01:23:55,659
Oh!

939
01:23:55,947 --> 01:23:57,906
- You've been to Asgard.
- Where are your pants?

940
01:23:57,907 --> 01:23:59,659
Oh, he, uh...
He says it helps him think.

941
01:23:59,784 --> 01:24:01,452
Okay, well, I'm going to need
everything you got on this.

942
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:04,172
All the work you've been doing
on gravimetric anomalies, everything.

943
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,539
Okay.

944
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,634
Are you well, Erik?

945
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:09,586
Your brother's not coming, is he?

946
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:12,004
Loki is dead.

947
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:13,097
Oh, thank God!

948
01:24:14,257 --> 01:24:16,476
I... I meant, I'm so sorry.

949
01:24:16,593 --> 01:24:18,140
Thank you.

950
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:43,620
Forgive me, my liege.

951
01:24:44,454 --> 01:24:46,957
I've returned from
the Dark World with news.

952
01:24:49,417 --> 01:24:50,509
Thor?

953
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:55,595
There was no sign of Thor,
or the weapon, but...

954
01:24:57,425 --> 01:24:58,642
What?

955
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:03,223
We found a body.

956
01:25:07,936 --> 01:25:09,062
Loki.

957
01:25:13,086 --> 01:25:15,150
Malekith is going to
fire the Aether at a spot

958
01:25:15,151 --> 01:25:17,074
where all the nine worlds
are connecting.

959
01:25:17,195 --> 01:25:19,738
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

960
01:25:19,739 --> 01:25:21,161
For each additional world,

961
01:25:21,282 --> 01:25:23,376
the power will increase exponentially.

962
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:26,539
The effect would be universal.

963
01:25:26,663 --> 01:25:28,372
But the Alignment is only temporary.

964
01:25:28,373 --> 01:25:31,422
He must be in
exactly the right place at the right time.

965
01:25:31,543 --> 01:25:33,216
Well, how do we know where that is?

966
01:25:34,420 --> 01:25:36,843
We follow the directions.

967
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,258
This has happened before

968
01:25:38,383 --> 01:25:41,728
thousands of years ago,
and the Ancients were there to see it.

969
01:25:42,387 --> 01:25:43,764
All the great constructions,

970
01:25:44,597 --> 01:25:47,391
the Mayans, the Chinese,
the Egyptians.

971
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:50,894
They made use of the gravitational
effects of the Convergence.

972
01:25:50,895 --> 01:25:53,063
And they left us a map.

973
01:25:53,064 --> 01:25:54,486
Stonehenge,

974
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,067
Snowdon,

975
01:25:57,068 --> 01:25:58,318
the Great Orme.

976
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,196
These are all coordinates taking us...

977
01:26:01,573 --> 01:26:02,574
Here.

978
01:26:05,076 --> 01:26:06,618
Greenwich?

979
01:26:06,619 --> 01:26:09,247
The walls between worlds
will be almost non-existent.

980
01:26:09,414 --> 01:26:10,789
Physics is going to go ballistic.

981
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,633
Increases and decreases in gravity,

982
01:26:12,750 --> 01:26:14,293
spatial extrusions.

983
01:26:14,294 --> 01:26:16,922
The very fabric of reality
is going to be torn apart.

984
01:26:20,175 --> 01:26:22,428
I better get my pants.

985
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,355
Focus! This is important.

986
01:26:25,513 --> 01:26:26,981
We have to hammer them in
all around the site

987
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:29,396
and then Jane and Erik
will activate them from the tower.

988
01:26:29,726 --> 01:26:31,194
They're taped together.

989
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:33,692
Do you even know
what these things do?

990
01:26:34,063 --> 01:26:35,690
Uh... No.

991
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:37,025
Neither do I.

992
01:26:42,030 --> 01:26:43,122
Shh!

993
01:26:45,825 --> 01:26:47,827
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Right.

994
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:01,633
Holy...

995
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:02,759
Shit.

996
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:16,272
Ah!

997
01:28:21,296 --> 01:28:23,594
You needn't have come
so far, Asgardian.

998
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,934
Death would've come to you
soon enough.

999
01:28:26,050 --> 01:28:27,634
Not by your hand.

1000
01:28:27,635 --> 01:28:30,470
Your universe was never meant to be.

1001
01:28:30,471 --> 01:28:33,640
Your world and your family

1002
01:28:33,641 --> 01:28:35,769
will be extinguished!

1003
01:28:37,979 --> 01:28:39,401
We're running out of time.

1004
01:28:39,522 --> 01:28:41,940
- Almost there.
- Are you sure this is going to work?

1005
01:28:41,941 --> 01:28:44,535
These devices were made
to detect anomalies, not cause them.

1006
01:28:45,570 --> 01:28:46,662
Oh, come on.

1007
01:28:51,909 --> 01:28:54,037
Come on, Darcy.

1008
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,432
You know, with all that power,

1009
01:29:06,549 --> 01:29:08,051
I thought you'd hit harder.

1010
01:29:33,451 --> 01:29:34,543
Done.

1011
01:29:41,459 --> 01:29:44,178
The Convergence
will be in full effect in seven minutes.

1012
01:29:44,295 --> 01:29:46,496
That just means we have to
keep Malekith busy for eight.

1013
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,847
Okay, you might want to
hold on to something.

1014
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:01,978
That is awesome!

1015
01:30:01,979 --> 01:30:03,563
<i>How did you do that?</i>

1016
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:04,940
Well, the gravitational fields

1017
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:07,317
interact with the weak spots
between worlds, creating...

1018
01:30:07,318 --> 01:30:08,740
Ooh, get the guy with the sword!

1019
01:30:12,156 --> 01:30:14,033
- Oops.
- Let's go.

1020
01:30:14,158 --> 01:30:15,580
Um...

1021
01:30:15,764 --> 01:30:17,828
What the hell just happened?

1022
01:30:17,829 --> 01:30:19,456
Move!

1023
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,562
What are you all doing?

1024
01:30:38,683 --> 01:30:40,356
You need to get out of here, now!

1025
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:42,023
You're joking, right?

1026
01:30:42,145 --> 01:30:43,186
That's Thor out there.

1027
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:45,315
He's waving his hammer around
and everything!

1028
01:31:44,123 --> 01:31:45,625
Ah!

1029
01:32:03,487 --> 01:32:05,352
<i>Confirming ship is hostile.</i>

1030
01:32:05,353 --> 01:32:07,312
<i>Confirmed, ship is hostile.</i>

1031
01:32:07,313 --> 01:32:08,813
<i>You have permission to engage.</i>

1032
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:10,106
<i>Roger.</i>

1033
01:32:10,107 --> 01:32:11,233
<i>Missiles locked.</i>

1034
01:32:12,068 --> 01:32:13,820
<i>Missiles away.</i>

1035
01:32:15,279 --> 01:32:16,530
<i>Missiles off target.</i>

1036
01:32:16,531 --> 01:32:19,324
<i>I repeat, target missed.
I'm losing control.</i>

1037
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:22,124
<i>Mayday! Mayday! Lost positive control.</i>

1038
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,330
What are you doing?

1039
01:32:25,331 --> 01:32:26,833
My signal's not connecting.

1040
01:32:29,126 --> 01:32:30,210
Jane!

1041
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:31,303
Come on.

1042
01:33:13,588 --> 01:33:14,885
Are you all right?

1043
01:33:15,047 --> 01:33:16,048
You saved my life.

1044
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:20,760
Yeah.

1045
01:33:20,761 --> 01:33:22,058
I guess I did.

1046
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:30,855
Mmm.

1047
01:33:31,230 --> 01:33:32,231
Darcy?

1048
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:33,648
Jane!

1049
01:33:33,649 --> 01:33:35,993
- Ian!
- Selvig!

1050
01:33:36,527 --> 01:33:37,699
Mew mew!

1051
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:43,201
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1052
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:46,493
How do I get to Greenwich?

1053
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:49,540
Take this train. Three stops.

1054
01:33:51,626 --> 01:33:54,129
<i>Mind the gap.</i>

1055
01:33:56,047 --> 01:33:58,015
Sorry. Sorry.

1056
01:34:35,503 --> 01:34:37,176
- We're out of time.
- Jane.

1057
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:39,423
Jane!

1058
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,788
Thor!

1059
01:35:07,785 --> 01:35:08,832
We're too late.

1060
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:12,298
The Convergence is at its peak.

1061
01:35:13,165 --> 01:35:14,291
Can those things stop him?

1062
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:15,509
Not from here.

1063
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:18,467
We can't get close enough.

1064
01:35:19,505 --> 01:35:20,757
I can.

1065
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:47,074
Malekith!

1066
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:57,711
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1067
01:35:57,835 --> 01:36:01,212
Have you come
to witness the end of your universe?

1068
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:03,261
I've come to accept your surrender.

1069
01:36:22,818 --> 01:36:24,912
You think you can stop this?

1070
01:36:25,613 --> 01:36:28,412
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1071
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:30,205
But you can.

1072
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:17,748
Thor! No.

1073
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,139
Jane!

1074
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:51,699
Ah!

1075
01:37:59,832 --> 01:38:01,425
Everybody okay?

1076
01:38:46,003 --> 01:38:47,926
He's gonna come back.

1077
01:38:50,424 --> 01:38:52,301
Except, you know,

1078
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:54,677
last time he was gone for,
like, two years.

1079
01:38:54,678 --> 01:38:56,601
Well, it's only been two days, so...

1080
01:38:58,515 --> 01:39:00,358
Did he say anything before he left?

1081
01:39:00,476 --> 01:39:02,727
Yeah, he had to figure
some stuff out with his father.

1082
01:39:02,728 --> 01:39:06,858
He kinda committed treason...
On our way out.

1083
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:12,742
Oh.

1084
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:20,042
<i>You once said there
would never be a wiser king than me.</i>

1085
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:21,205
<i>You were wrong.</i>

1086
01:39:21,789 --> 01:39:25,750
The Alignment has brought
all the realms together.

1087
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:28,880
Every one of them
saw you offer your life to save them.

1088
01:39:29,546 --> 01:39:33,972
What can Asgard offer
its new king in return?

1089
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:37,012
My life.

1090
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:40,932
Father, I cannot be king of Asgard.

1091
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:45,734
I will protect Asgard and all the realms
with my last and every breath,

1092
01:39:45,854 --> 01:39:48,107
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1093
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:52,362
Loki, for all his grave imbalance,
understood rule as I know I never will.

1094
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:56,036
The brutality, the sacrifice...

1095
01:39:56,198 --> 01:39:57,740
It changes you.

1096
01:39:57,741 --> 01:40:01,166
I'd rather be a good man
than a great king.

1097
01:40:01,745 --> 01:40:06,624
Is this my son I hear,
or the woman he loves?

1098
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:09,174
When you speak,
do I never hear Mother's voice?

1099
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:13,798
This is not for Jane, Father.

1100
01:40:13,799 --> 01:40:16,300
She does not know
what I came here to say.

1101
01:40:16,301 --> 01:40:19,646
Now, forbid me to see her,
or say she can rule at my side.

1102
01:40:19,763 --> 01:40:21,106
It changes nothing.

1103
01:40:21,682 --> 01:40:25,027
One son
who wanted the throne too much,

1104
01:40:25,936 --> 01:40:28,064
another who will not take it.

1105
01:40:28,605 --> 01:40:30,357
Is this my legacy?

1106
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:32,117
Loki died with honor.

1107
01:40:33,068 --> 01:40:34,527
I shall try to live the same.

1108
01:40:34,528 --> 01:40:35,950
Is that not legacy enough?

1109
01:40:46,957 --> 01:40:49,301
It belongs to you.

1110
01:40:50,044 --> 01:40:51,878
If you are worthy of it.

1111
01:40:51,879 --> 01:40:54,382
I shall try to be.

1112
01:40:55,799 --> 01:41:00,521
I cannot give you my blessing,
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1113
01:41:01,472 --> 01:41:03,145
I know.

1114
01:41:05,976 --> 01:41:09,321
If I were proud of
the man my son had become,

1115
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:12,157
even that, I could not say.

1116
01:41:14,651 --> 01:41:18,281
It would speak only from my heart.

1117
01:41:19,656 --> 01:41:21,078
Go,

1118
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:23,661
my son.

1119
01:41:25,788 --> 01:41:27,040
Thank you, Father.

1120
01:41:42,638 --> 01:41:43,685
No.

1121
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:46,688
Thank you.

1122
01:44:04,696 --> 01:44:07,119
I present to you,

1123
01:44:07,824 --> 01:44:11,328
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1124
01:44:12,829 --> 01:44:14,001
Whoa...

1125
01:44:17,084 --> 01:44:21,635
Asgardians, it's an honor.

1126
01:44:25,342 --> 01:44:27,436
You know why we're here.

1127
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:33,062
Of course.

1128
01:44:33,892 --> 01:44:36,145
But, if I may ask,

1129
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:40,191
why not keep it secure
in your own vault?

1130
01:44:40,315 --> 01:44:43,239
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

1131
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:46,910
It is not wise to keep
two Infinity Stones so close together.

1132
01:44:47,531 --> 01:44:50,034
That's very wise.

1133
01:44:59,876 --> 01:45:01,253
I can assure you,

1134
01:45:02,504 --> 01:45:07,726
it will be absolutely safe here,

1135
01:45:09,928 --> 01:45:12,431
in my collection.

1136
01:45:13,598 --> 01:45:16,021
See that it is.

1137
01:45:34,578 --> 01:45:37,081
One down.

1138
01:45:38,582 --> 01:45:41,085
Five to go.

1139
