1
00:01:02,672 --> 00:01:06,456
SANTORINI, GREECE

2
00:03:14,404 --> 00:03:18,449
They've found another one.
There'll be no treasure left for her.

3
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,532
Mark the location.

4
00:03:20,744 --> 00:03:25,287
That's the Frenchman.
And over there, Kristos.

5
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:28,868
They're all coming. All except one.

6
00:03:29,085 --> 00:03:31,458
All right, follow Kristos.

7
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:33,794
When he dives, we dive.

8
00:03:34,007 --> 00:03:38,965
Maybe we'll get lucky
and find whatever's down there.

9
00:03:40,013 --> 00:03:45,304
Look at that, Jimmy. Look!
Why isn't she slowing down?

10
00:03:48,522 --> 00:03:51,641
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

11
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:55,310
- You were asking?
- I knew it!

12
00:04:13,255 --> 00:04:15,959
Hello, boys. You're all wet.

13
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:21,010
Many raiders are here,
and you make us wait!

14
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,839
But you know I can't resist a bit of fun.

15
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:31,723
What's all this fuss about?
What do they think is down there?

16
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:37,100
I don't know what they think,
but I think it's the Luna Temple.

17
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,147
The Luna Temple?

18
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:42,235
My sons! If it's not on television, forget it!

19
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:46,282
- It was built by Alexander the Great.
- A Greek, if you don't know!

20
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:50,708
Alexander collected treasures
and stored them in two places.

21
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:54,203
The majority went to his library in Egypt.

22
00:04:54,421 --> 00:05:00,127
But his most prized possessions
went here... the Luna Temple.

23
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:04,637
By law, no one was allowed to record
its location, and in 330 BC it was...

24
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:09,261
...swallowed by the sea.
- Destroyed during a volcanic eruption.

25
00:05:09,478 --> 00:05:11,969
Lost for ever.

26
00:05:12,189 --> 00:05:13,564
Until yesterday.

27
00:05:15,358 --> 00:05:20,234
If even half of it is intact, it will be
the greatest find since the Pyramids.

28
00:05:20,447 --> 00:05:23,317
The others are heading along this shelf.

29
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:26,155
- That's based on the currents?
- Yes.

30
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:29,536
This, Gus, is why I was late.

31
00:05:29,748 --> 00:05:32,914
It's a geological,
taken two hours after the quake.

32
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:37,587
The epicentre was here,
five miles northeast of us, but...

33
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:41,842
...look at the currents
along the shelf now.

34
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:44,009
Wait! They've shifted.

35
00:05:44,221 --> 00:05:48,847
So, while they're all diving there,
the ruins will actually be...

36
00:05:51,144 --> 00:05:53,386
...here.

37
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,562
Let's go.

38
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,785
Something wrong?

39
00:06:20,006 --> 00:06:23,458
First, Alexander doesn't record
the temple's location.

40
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,797
Then, God wipes it from the earth
with a volcano.

41
00:06:27,013 --> 00:06:29,765
Now, even the currents change.

42
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:34,103
Lara, maybe this temple's
not meant to be found.

43
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,816
Everything lost is meant to be found.
Don't worry.

44
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,315
It's incredible!

45
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,443
It's unbelievable! Whoa!

46
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:54,108
- Oh, my God.
- This is huge!

47
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:55,738
Thank you.

48
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:02,793
Wonderful.

49
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,835
Jimmy, this is wonderful!

50
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:11,628
- Do you see what I see?
- Oh, my God!

51
00:09:11,845 --> 00:09:13,838
It's incredible.

52
00:09:14,055 --> 00:09:17,721
Nicky, look at this.
We're going to be rich!

53
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:26,270
Lara! What do you say
to two handsome Greek partners?

54
00:09:26,485 --> 00:09:29,402
Well, when you find two, let me know!

55
00:09:29,613 --> 00:09:33,657
- She's talking about you.
- No, you!

56
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,825
Pack the gold coins.

57
00:10:17,369 --> 00:10:21,117
- Lara, what is that?
- It's mine.

58
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,337
What is she doing?

59
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,703
Lara! That column is collapsing!

60
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:11,794
Aftershock!

61
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:15,376
- I think that's a sign to leave!
- Two minutes!

62
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:20,886
- Lara, we need to leave now!
- We've got to move!

63
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,612
Keep packing. This thing is going
to collapse. Take those two.

64
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:39,115
- We have to hurry up.
- Go, go! Come on!

65
00:11:43,246 --> 00:11:44,788
Lara!

66
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:38,242
Lara? Lara, it's us, Hillary and Bryce!

67
00:16:41,128 --> 00:16:44,627
She's disorientated.
That's normal after three days.

68
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,794
Nice day for a dip.

69
00:16:48,802 --> 00:16:52,752
Gentlemen, there is an expression:

70
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:57,553
"It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."

71
00:16:57,769 --> 00:17:03,060
Yet that is precisely what I've been
doing for some time now...

72
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:07,771
...whether it be sarin gas for Mr San,

73
00:17:07,988 --> 00:17:11,772
improved typhoid for Mr Krev
to use in the Balkans,

74
00:17:11,992 --> 00:17:15,740
enhanced cholera for Mr Duvalier.

75
00:17:15,954 --> 00:17:18,706
While these weapons
serve their purpose,

76
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:22,000
there have always been limitations.

77
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:25,164
Stable diseases aren't lethal.

78
00:17:26,298 --> 00:17:29,252
Deadly ones burn out too quickly.

79
00:17:29,468 --> 00:17:32,837
Mother Nature can only
be fooled so much.

80
00:17:33,847 --> 00:17:39,553
Deploy my weapon, and your enemies,
however great, will collapse from within.

81
00:17:45,025 --> 00:17:49,485
Rather like Mr Monza's
collapsing right now.

82
00:17:57,621 --> 00:18:02,413
- What the hell is going on?
- Monza told Ml6 about this meeting.

83
00:18:02,626 --> 00:18:05,164
That's why the change of location.

84
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:11,915
He was going to turn me over to them
and then seek asylum in the West.

85
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:15,006
A smart man would've known
I was on to him.

86
00:18:15,222 --> 00:18:19,515
He would never have got on the plane.
But I knew you would.

87
00:18:19,726 --> 00:18:22,478
You actually thought you could fool me.

88
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:32,360
That, gentlemen, is the sound
of a traitor dying.

89
00:18:42,415 --> 00:18:47,208
That was an accelerated form of Ebola,
deadliest disease known to man.

90
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,378
Highly contagious.

91
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:55,085
However, as with all known diseases,

92
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:58,589
there exist stockpiles of antiserum
in the West.

93
00:19:27,461 --> 00:19:31,292
There is no antiserum
for what I am offering you.

94
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:34,293
No treatment. No vaccine. No cure.

95
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:37,795
The world's never seen
anything like what I've uncovered.

96
00:19:38,013 --> 00:19:39,590
Uncovered?

97
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:42,593
Yes. I've branched out.

98
00:19:42,809 --> 00:19:45,479
Archaeology.

99
00:19:45,687 --> 00:19:49,554
0-7-7-4-4-6-8-1.

100
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:53,772
That is the account
at the Landesbank in Bern.

101
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:57,819
$100 million each, if you please.

102
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:26,476
- Where's Chen Lo?
- He has the orb, but Ml6 is on to him.

103
00:20:26,686 --> 00:20:28,145
- How?
- He doesn't know.

104
00:20:28,355 --> 00:20:31,356
Rather than risk bringing it, he's waiting.

105
00:20:31,566 --> 00:20:36,691
I have just told a cabin full of men about
Pandora. The clock cannot be reset.

106
00:20:36,905 --> 00:20:39,063
Tell him to bring the orb at once.

107
00:20:57,592 --> 00:21:02,219
You'll find the killers.
Don't take it out on me!

108
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,822
- Bryce, what have we got?
- I haven't loaded your images yet.

109
00:21:27,956 --> 00:21:30,992
- What about references to an orb?
- I checked.

110
00:21:31,209 --> 00:21:34,329
Inventories of the Luna Temple
do not list any orb.

111
00:21:34,546 --> 00:21:38,959
I want you both to list every orb
ever mentioned in Greek history.

112
00:21:39,176 --> 00:21:40,884
Every one?

113
00:21:51,229 --> 00:21:53,851
That's... liable...

114
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,939
...to be...

115
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:01,613
...thousands.

116
00:22:03,783 --> 00:22:06,191
Then we'll read thousands.

117
00:22:08,705 --> 00:22:11,030
Start with that one.

118
00:23:05,303 --> 00:23:08,174
Perhaps you'd like some tea
while you wait?

119
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,099
No, they wouldn't. Tea is for guests,
the door is for intruders!

120
00:23:15,063 --> 00:23:17,020
They're from Ml6.

121
00:23:17,232 --> 00:23:20,648
I can tell from their soft hands
and pressed suits.

122
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:24,360
They make decisions
and leave the dirty work for others.

123
00:23:24,573 --> 00:23:28,191
- I've no interest in...
- His name's Chen Lo.

124
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:33,036
Along with his brother Xien, he runs
a ring of bandits, the Shay Ling.

125
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:37,376
They deal in guns, diamonds, antiquities
to sell on the black market.

126
00:23:37,586 --> 00:23:42,129
They followed you when you arrived
in Santorini, where they killed Gus.

127
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,092
- Why?
- For this.

128
00:23:45,302 --> 00:23:48,801
Our listening post in Malta
intercepted that fax.

129
00:23:49,014 --> 00:23:52,465
It was sent from Chen Lo
to a man named Jonathan Reiss.

130
00:23:52,684 --> 00:23:54,890
The scientist? Won the Nobel Prize?

131
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:59,432
He's now the foremost designer
of biological weapons in the world.

132
00:23:59,649 --> 00:24:04,027
His creations have been at the heart
of bio-terror in the past 15 years.

133
00:24:04,237 --> 00:24:10,572
Reiss's disdain for life is legendary.
He doesn't care who his weapons kill.

134
00:24:10,785 --> 00:24:13,407
A modern-day Doctor Mengele.

135
00:24:17,793 --> 00:24:22,039
We know Chen Lo followed you
to obtain the orb, and thus deliver Reiss.

136
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:25,375
We don't know why.
Candidly, that terrifies us.

137
00:24:25,592 --> 00:24:28,795
Reiss is not to be trifled with.

138
00:24:29,012 --> 00:24:31,503
Pandora's box.

139
00:24:34,392 --> 00:24:38,604
Reiss is going to use the orb
to find Pandora's box.

140
00:24:38,814 --> 00:24:40,474
The Greek myth?

141
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:45,187
Pandora opens a forbidden box
and unleashes pain into the world?

142
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:49,069
That's the Sunday school version, yes.

143
00:24:49,282 --> 00:24:54,193
How do you think life began?
Shooting star? Primordial ooze?

144
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:57,283
In 2300 BC, an Egyptian pharaoh

145
00:24:57,499 --> 00:25:02,838
found a place he named The Cradle
of Life, where we, life, began.

146
00:25:03,046 --> 00:25:06,213
There he found a box,
which brought life to Earth.

147
00:25:06,424 --> 00:25:10,553
The pharaoh opened it, but all that
was left was the Ramante, or anti-life.

148
00:25:10,762 --> 00:25:13,633
The plague, the companion to life.

149
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:16,553
- Companion?
- Nature is about balance.

150
00:25:16,768 --> 00:25:21,560
All the world comes in pairs.
Yin and Yang, right and wrong.

151
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:25,937
- What did this plague do?
- It levelled the pharaoh's army.

152
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:31,776
A soldier was dispatched to transport
the box to the end of the world.

153
00:25:34,035 --> 00:25:38,080
2,000 years later,
Alexander the Great reached India,

154
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:43,794
where his army was ravaged
by a plague after finding a box.

155
00:25:44,004 --> 00:25:47,503
India?
That's where the soldier brought it?

156
00:25:47,716 --> 00:25:50,503
Alexander felt the box
was too powerful,

157
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:53,969
so he returned it to its home,
The Cradle of Life.

158
00:25:54,181 --> 00:25:56,304
It has never been seen since.

159
00:25:56,516 --> 00:26:00,384
- And this Cradle of Life is where?
- No one knows.

160
00:26:00,604 --> 00:26:05,266
Alexander used a map with the box,
which he then hid from the world.

161
00:26:05,484 --> 00:26:08,401
But the name he gave this map
was "Mati",

162
00:26:08,612 --> 00:26:13,950
and the literal translation
for the word "Mati" is eye.

163
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,904
The orb is the map, hidden
in the Luna Temple by Alexander.

164
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:22,954
Reiss will use it to find Pandora's box,
and when he opens it,

165
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:28,293
he will unleash a weapon more
powerful than you could ever imagine.

166
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:36,130
The markings form a pattern,
but even if I figure what they mean,

167
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:41,223
we still can't read the whole map
because we've only a partial view.

168
00:26:41,436 --> 00:26:45,481
- We have to figure out how to read it.
- Right. Thank you.

169
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,352
On behalf of Her Majesty,
recover this box before Doctor Reiss.

170
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:55,813
Oh...! Well, now that I have
Her Majesty's permission...

171
00:26:56,034 --> 00:27:01,076
- Tell me where to find the orb.
- It's in China with Chen Lo.

172
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,575
We'll assign two of our best agents
to help.

173
00:27:04,793 --> 00:27:06,832
I don't want them.

174
00:27:07,045 --> 00:27:11,541
- Expertise in archaeology doesn't...
- I didn't say that I don't need help.

175
00:27:11,758 --> 00:27:18,093
But you won't get me there in time.
I need someone inside the Shay Ling.

176
00:27:18,306 --> 00:27:21,260
Their methods, their hideouts.

177
00:27:23,562 --> 00:27:29,102
- I need Terry Sheridan.
- Not if he were the last man on Earth!

178
00:27:29,317 --> 00:27:32,521
Terry Sheridan, ex-commander
with the Royal Marines,

179
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:35,110
turned mercenary and traitor.

180
00:27:35,866 --> 00:27:41,702
Put that man on the trail of a weapon
he can sell to the highest bidder?

181
00:27:57,429 --> 00:27:59,220
Open!

182
00:28:00,432 --> 00:28:02,555
I am your host, Armin Kal.

183
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,305
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

184
00:28:57,155 --> 00:28:58,863
Croft.

185
00:28:59,074 --> 00:29:00,734
Hello, Terry.

186
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,918
What do you think of my new place?

187
00:29:12,129 --> 00:29:14,620
It's not quite Croft Manor.

188
00:29:16,216 --> 00:29:18,624
What? A key to your heart?

189
00:29:18,844 --> 00:29:24,348
To a flat in Zurich.
You can pick another city, if you want.

190
00:29:24,558 --> 00:29:27,049
Your record expunged,
your citizenship restored.

191
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,475
- By?
- Ml6.

192
00:29:29,688 --> 00:29:31,645
Ml6...

193
00:29:31,857 --> 00:29:35,107
Would that make me Faust,
or the Devil?

194
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:39,186
Pick one, because Ml6 will also
arrange a new identity.

195
00:29:39,406 --> 00:29:45,776
- Yeah? You think I need their help?
- Having two faces doesn't count.

196
00:29:45,996 --> 00:29:48,035
What do I have to do?

197
00:29:48,248 --> 00:29:51,534
- Take me to the Shay Ling.
- The Shay who?

198
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:55,535
Chen Lo took something from me
and I want it back.

199
00:29:55,755 --> 00:29:57,997
Is that you or Ml6?

200
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:02,000
Also, I've arranged for £5 million
when we succeed.

201
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,004
- Call it "second chance" money.
- Or life insurance for you.

202
00:30:06,224 --> 00:30:08,929
I don't need any.

203
00:30:11,771 --> 00:30:13,645
You and I, working alone?

204
00:30:13,857 --> 00:30:17,641
It's easier to see through you that way.

205
00:30:17,861 --> 00:30:19,521
So what if, afterwards,

206
00:30:19,738 --> 00:30:24,067
Ml6 decide that me back in the world
isn't such a great idea?

207
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:28,697
Then I feel sorry for whomever
they get to come after you.

208
00:30:33,168 --> 00:30:37,664
- You've authorisation to kill me?
- Any time, for any reason.

209
00:30:37,881 --> 00:30:40,882
Why don't you just do it, then?

210
00:30:41,092 --> 00:30:44,296
What is it they say? "Hell hath no fury..."

211
00:30:44,513 --> 00:30:46,589
You're not that good.

212
00:30:46,807 --> 00:30:49,973
The Shay Ling are like ghosts, Croft.

213
00:30:50,811 --> 00:30:52,435
They move constantly,

214
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:56,346
and their home is the most remote
mountain region in China.

215
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:58,393
Region?

216
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:01,445
You'll have to do better than that.

217
00:31:12,874 --> 00:31:16,954
Get me into China,
and I'll get you to them in a day.

218
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:21,085
No guns, no money,
no weapons of any kind.

219
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,170
Talk about taking the fun out of life!

220
00:31:40,819 --> 00:31:42,728
They've spies all over China.

221
00:31:42,946 --> 00:31:46,944
We slip in to Beijing undetected,
then we go by truck.

222
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:52,034
Truck? I was thinking
about something a little faster.

223
00:31:58,003 --> 00:31:59,794
A little faster?

224
00:32:03,091 --> 00:32:07,837
This is a little faster,
but the Chinese will track the pod.

225
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:14,934
- There won't be any pod to find.
- Will there be any of us to find?

226
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:23,768
- Ready? Now.
- Ready for what?

227
00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:45,840
The ditching was good, Croft.
I'll give you that.

228
00:32:46,051 --> 00:32:51,009
But we'll never find a vehicle
in a place like this.

229
00:32:56,686 --> 00:32:59,522
Oh, it's so lovely to see you.

230
00:33:01,858 --> 00:33:03,602
- Is everything ready?
- Yes.

231
00:33:03,819 --> 00:33:08,527
Your clothes, guns and knives
are over there.

232
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,191
And I took the liberty of tuning your bike.

233
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,403
- May I?
- Yes.

234
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:33,389
- Lara.
- Ah!

235
00:33:33,598 --> 00:33:37,726
- What is the happy couple up to?
- Accessorising.

236
00:33:37,936 --> 00:33:42,397
- Where are we on reading the orb?
- All maps have a key, a legend.

237
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:45,644
The orb's key's not there,
it must've been lost.

238
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:48,565
Or somewhere in the temple.

239
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:52,232
Go through every image I took
near the orb.

240
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,575
The key must've been linked to it
in some way. Right, bye, then.

241
00:33:57,789 --> 00:34:02,285
It's unlike Lara to take a partner.
Where are you two going?

242
00:34:02,502 --> 00:34:08,338
We'll take a nice little trip,
breathe some fresh mountain air,

243
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:10,839
stop by my friends, the Shay Ling.

244
00:34:24,524 --> 00:34:28,356
The Shay Ling watch all the roads,
we'll go round the back.

245
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:31,903
- We'll go straight.
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

246
00:34:32,115 --> 00:34:36,195
The Shay Ling have men
on every road from here to Luoyang.

247
00:34:36,411 --> 00:34:39,032
Not every road.

248
00:35:11,446 --> 00:35:14,898
- A bit rusty?
- It's coming back.

249
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:17,074
I expected more from a Scot.

250
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:20,654
I don't expect anything
from an Englishwoman!

251
00:35:20,872 --> 00:35:23,873
Good, 'cause you're
not gonna get anything.

252
00:36:02,497 --> 00:36:07,076
The fun's over.
From now on, it's by foot.

253
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:13,871
- Best to reconsider that "no gun" rule.
- No.

254
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,343
OK.

255
00:36:25,103 --> 00:36:27,725
And don't be looking at my ass.

256
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:31,774
- Where do I fit in?
- You're the guide.

257
00:36:31,985 --> 00:36:33,444
I mean,

258
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:37,865
when you think back on the vast
scheme of your adventurous life,

259
00:36:38,074 --> 00:36:40,233
where do I fit in?

260
00:36:40,452 --> 00:36:44,496
Was I the love of your life
or just another bump on the road?

261
00:36:44,706 --> 00:36:50,661
Was I time well spent?
Four months, more good than bad?

262
00:36:50,879 --> 00:36:55,375
Come on, it had to be more
than that, am I right?

263
00:36:55,592 --> 00:36:57,668
You're right.

264
00:36:57,886 --> 00:37:00,507
It was five months.

265
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,098
- You're laughing at me.
- Because I used to find you charming.

266
00:37:08,814 --> 00:37:11,221
I am charming.

267
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:39,091
You're late!

268
00:37:44,516 --> 00:37:47,766
Tilt your head back. Do it!

269
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:54,979
You might see again in an hour. Maybe.

270
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:10,875
What's this? It's not there.
There's no orb.

271
00:38:12,335 --> 00:38:16,285
Is there anything
you can tell me about this?

272
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:33,646
- Hello?
- You didn't like your messenger?

273
00:38:33,857 --> 00:38:37,142
I didn't. But I liked the men
I lost in the temple.

274
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,934
You underestimated Lady Croft.

275
00:38:40,155 --> 00:38:44,366
I underestimated
how much this orb is worth.

276
00:38:44,576 --> 00:38:47,447
There's so many
horrible diseases in the world.

277
00:38:47,662 --> 00:38:50,782
Things we are particularly
susceptible to as children.

278
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:54,866
You could be holding
little Shiho or Tai by the hand,

279
00:38:55,086 --> 00:38:58,372
as a mysterious ailment
ravages their bodies.

280
00:38:59,257 --> 00:39:03,421
You kill them, and I will give
your orb to Lady Croft.

281
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:07,219
She's a few miles away
from here as we speak.

282
00:39:07,432 --> 00:39:09,888
I wonder how much she would pay.

283
00:39:10,727 --> 00:39:13,348
I'll pay you an additional $12 million.

284
00:39:13,563 --> 00:39:18,724
It will be yours once you've delivered
the orb along with Lady Croft's body.

285
00:39:18,944 --> 00:39:22,776
- You don't know where they are.
- You're impossible.

286
00:39:22,989 --> 00:39:26,405
You pretended to know
so I'd get you out.

287
00:39:26,618 --> 00:39:30,402
This isn't a tomb, Croft,
and the Shay Ling aren't mummies.

288
00:39:30,622 --> 00:39:34,038
They're killers.
But if you don't trust me...

289
00:39:38,713 --> 00:39:44,170
I'm sorry to have to do this,
but you're wasting time.

290
00:39:46,304 --> 00:39:49,175
You want to shoot me? Shoot me.

291
00:39:49,391 --> 00:39:51,882
Personally, I'd rather you do it...

292
00:39:52,102 --> 00:39:54,141
...than them.

293
00:40:12,205 --> 00:40:13,830
Well, Terry,

294
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:19,497
what part of "never come back again"
didn't you understand?

295
00:40:21,381 --> 00:40:23,753
You wanted to find the Shay Ling.

296
00:40:25,302 --> 00:40:26,630
Come on!

297
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:30,545
The only way to get into their place
is as their prisoners.

298
00:40:30,765 --> 00:40:34,680
- You might've told me that before.
- You would've believed me?

299
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:38,892
Make Chen Lo a better offer
than his buyer. He'll cross them.

300
00:40:39,107 --> 00:40:42,357
Even if his buyer's Jonathan Reiss?

301
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:45,321
You might've told me that before!

302
00:41:29,699 --> 00:41:34,575
- Were you really gonna kill me?
- I bet she would have.

303
00:41:34,788 --> 00:41:38,453
I've seen her in action.
Didn't Terry tell you?

304
00:41:38,667 --> 00:41:42,878
The last time any of us saw him,
he was riding away with a truck...

305
00:41:43,505 --> 00:41:46,210
...full of my Ming vases.

306
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:48,915
And sitting next to him...

307
00:41:50,554 --> 00:41:53,009
...was his sister.

308
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:55,802
How is she?

309
00:41:56,017 --> 00:41:59,137
You... shouldn't have come here.

310
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:05,275
It got me out of prison.
Besides, the lady has a good offer.

311
00:42:05,485 --> 00:42:08,439
- Better than Reiss.
- Really?

312
00:42:08,655 --> 00:42:11,739
- Should I take it?
- Take it.

313
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:18,238
Or you and I ransom her and the thing
back to the British for triple.

314
00:42:19,291 --> 00:42:21,248
Let's talk.

315
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,748
Not you, Terry.

316
00:42:23,962 --> 00:42:26,334
Lady Croft and I.

317
00:42:26,548 --> 00:42:30,296
You wait here. Catch up.

318
00:42:30,886 --> 00:42:34,052
I'll be four minutes.

319
00:42:34,264 --> 00:42:36,221
Terrific.

320
00:42:38,768 --> 00:42:43,062
There is something
I think you will appreciate.

321
00:42:51,364 --> 00:42:56,073
This is the largest group
of terracotta warriors I have found.

322
00:42:56,286 --> 00:43:00,284
The King of Chin made them
for use in the afterlife.

323
00:43:00,499 --> 00:43:04,448
To fend off enemies
he made in this one.

324
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:07,955
Sounds like we could both use a set.

325
00:43:08,173 --> 00:43:10,842
I will be happy to sell some to you.

326
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:14,005
I hope you're as entrepreneurial
with the orb.

327
00:43:14,221 --> 00:43:19,974
You lost men, I lost men. I see
no reason we should both lose again.

328
00:43:20,185 --> 00:43:22,640
If I want double
what Reiss offered me...

329
00:43:22,854 --> 00:43:25,641
- Is it here?
- It's worth a lot.

330
00:43:25,857 --> 00:43:30,151
Then you know Reiss will kill you
the moment you give it to him.

331
00:43:30,362 --> 00:43:33,565
- Your government assures my safety?
- No.

332
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:36,320
But I will.

333
00:43:36,535 --> 00:43:39,489
That must hurt, saying that to me.

334
00:43:40,664 --> 00:43:43,534
Take the offer.

335
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:56,339
- You presume to give me orders?
- Take the offer before it expires.

336
00:43:56,555 --> 00:43:57,883
No.

337
00:43:58,098 --> 00:44:03,804
- Then I will have to force you.
- Then I will have to kill you!

338
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:15,622
Has it been four minutes yet?

339
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:00,884
That was nice.

340
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:05,758
It's too bad you're on the wrong side.

341
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:12,102
Tell me where the orb is
and it spares your life.

342
00:46:13,525 --> 00:46:16,312
The Flower Pagoda, in Shanghai.

343
00:46:16,528 --> 00:46:18,485
9 p.m.

344
00:46:20,574 --> 00:46:22,234
This is mine.

345
00:46:32,169 --> 00:46:34,126
Now, we're even.

346
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:49,511
Now!

347
00:47:07,412 --> 00:47:10,746
Remember that "no gun" rule?
I reconsidered.

348
00:47:42,948 --> 00:47:47,159
You know there was a staircase
we could've used?

349
00:48:12,644 --> 00:48:15,431
- Lara, are you all right?
- Smashing.

350
00:48:15,647 --> 00:48:20,475
I'm on my way to Shanghai,
and I need you to look at something.

351
00:48:20,694 --> 00:48:26,447
It was in the Luna Temple.
I'm betting it's the key to the markings.

352
00:48:26,658 --> 00:48:29,612
She's holding some sort
of musical instrument.

353
00:48:31,496 --> 00:48:33,868
It's sound.

354
00:48:34,082 --> 00:48:37,783
- That's brilliant.
- The key must be linked to it.

355
00:48:38,003 --> 00:48:41,087
I'll start decoding the images.
Get the rest. Bye.

356
00:48:41,298 --> 00:48:43,623
- Miss you.
- Bye!

357
00:49:53,078 --> 00:49:54,987
Oh, well.

358
00:49:55,205 --> 00:49:57,910
Just like old times.

359
00:50:02,003 --> 00:50:07,080
I think that's the first time
you've actually smiled because of me.

360
00:50:13,765 --> 00:50:16,007
Why did you do it?

361
00:50:16,226 --> 00:50:20,971
I started thinking I was tired of doing
things somebody else's way.

362
00:50:21,189 --> 00:50:23,431
It'd always be somebody else's way.

363
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:27,482
So you abandon your men
and betray your country?

364
00:50:27,696 --> 00:50:33,117
Leaving my men and my country,
that didn't hurt as much as I thought.

365
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:36,490
But leaving you did.

366
00:50:39,207 --> 00:50:43,157
You're a hard act to follow, Croft.

367
00:50:46,506 --> 00:50:50,006
You know why you and I
get along so well?

368
00:50:50,218 --> 00:50:51,760
No.

369
00:50:53,388 --> 00:50:56,839
We are two of a kind, me and you.

370
00:50:59,269 --> 00:51:03,978
- We are nothing alike.
- I don't think we're alike.

371
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:09,149
But I do think we're a pair.
Opposite sides of the same coin.

372
00:51:33,512 --> 00:51:38,304
- My men have the roof covered.
- Set down in the square instead.

373
00:51:38,517 --> 00:51:41,352
My men will also have things covered.

374
00:51:41,561 --> 00:51:43,554
OK, fine.

375
00:51:43,772 --> 00:51:45,681
OK, Sean, let's go!

376
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:52,525
They're landing in the square.

377
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:56,824
- We're in the wrong position. Stairs?
- No time.

378
00:51:57,035 --> 00:51:58,363
- Rooftops?
- No.

379
00:51:58,578 --> 00:52:03,573
I've got a plan.
Stay here. Wait for my signal.

380
00:52:07,129 --> 00:52:10,082
Here's the money, come and get it!

381
00:52:17,722 --> 00:52:19,181
Wait for my signal, huh?

382
00:52:19,391 --> 00:52:22,345
- Give me that box!
- Money first!

383
00:52:22,561 --> 00:52:27,388
- Give me that box now!
- No! You first!

384
00:52:35,907 --> 00:52:38,529
Christ! Get us out of here!

385
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:41,575
Take us up!

386
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,849
Take it up!

387
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:23,236
Go! Run her over!

388
00:53:38,011 --> 00:53:41,676
- Yeah?
- We tried it your way. Now we try mine.

389
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:45,140
- Bring it to the top of the pagoda now!
- OK.

390
00:54:24,516 --> 00:54:25,891
Got you!

391
00:54:36,111 --> 00:54:38,518
Come on! Hold it up!

392
00:54:46,288 --> 00:54:50,665
- Come closer!
- Raise it higher! Higher!

393
00:54:54,713 --> 00:54:59,339
- My regards to your brother!
- Too late.

394
00:55:00,218 --> 00:55:02,507
Croft, what are you doing?

395
00:55:13,482 --> 00:55:14,892
Take us up!

396
00:55:19,154 --> 00:55:20,897
Move! Go!

397
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,409
Let's go! Move!

398
00:55:42,928 --> 00:55:46,462
I'm tired of you pointing that at me.
You OK?

399
00:55:46,681 --> 00:55:51,427
- Never better.
- Looks like we lost the orb.

400
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:55,056
I wouldn't go vaulting
into thin air for nothing.

401
00:55:55,273 --> 00:55:57,895
I've put a tracer on the crate.

402
00:56:00,278 --> 00:56:02,318
Got it. Look.

403
00:56:07,118 --> 00:56:08,150
Impressive.

404
00:56:36,731 --> 00:56:41,061
A weapons lab
in the middle of the city? No way.

405
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:43,519
He must've dumped that crate.

406
00:56:43,738 --> 00:56:46,111
No, it's here.

407
00:56:46,324 --> 00:56:48,780
One of the buildings?

408
00:56:48,994 --> 00:56:53,703
No.
It's exactly where we're standing.

409
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:04,623
Part of me allowed for the possibility
that Pandora's box was just a legend.

410
00:57:05,635 --> 00:57:08,506
But now I know it's there.

411
00:57:13,602 --> 00:57:17,302
- She escaped.
- She has no idea where we are.

412
00:57:17,522 --> 00:57:19,349
We take no chances.

413
00:57:19,566 --> 00:57:23,813
Have everything we need to make
an antidote transferred to the jet.

414
00:57:27,782 --> 00:57:32,076
I need an out for two people.
Mid-city. Soon.

415
00:57:34,331 --> 00:57:37,285
What? Are you crazy?

416
00:57:38,376 --> 00:57:41,828
- Are we set?
- Piece of cake.

417
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,863
Hello.

418
00:59:46,797 --> 00:59:50,165
- So much for easy.
- What is that?

419
00:59:53,512 --> 00:59:55,635
He's already decoding the orb.

420
00:59:56,515 --> 00:59:58,139
Bugger!

421
01:00:00,644 --> 01:00:02,601
Headset.

422
01:00:24,543 --> 01:00:26,998
You've gotta get everyone out.

423
01:00:27,212 --> 01:00:30,166
What do you suggest, the fire alarm?

424
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:39,514
Not bad. But that's just the alarm.

425
01:00:40,433 --> 01:00:42,011
There's no danger.

426
01:00:42,227 --> 01:00:47,019
Do you think anyone here is paid
enough to take that chance?

427
01:00:53,405 --> 01:00:56,359
Don't even think about it.

428
01:00:57,450 --> 01:00:59,408
It's her.

429
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:03,997
Yes?

430
01:01:07,294 --> 01:01:08,836
Damn!

431
01:02:16,905 --> 01:02:20,523
I'm glad, Lara!
That would've been too easy!

432
01:02:25,330 --> 01:02:28,082
Give me your best!

433
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:45,969
How's that?

434
01:02:47,769 --> 01:02:51,387
- I'm going off-line.
- No, don't!

435
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:56,401
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

436
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:02,819
Hello, boys.
Did you understand the medallion?

437
01:03:03,034 --> 01:03:05,704
Yeah. The markings are sound waves.

438
01:03:05,912 --> 01:03:09,495
We've translated all the markings,
roughly half the orb.

439
01:03:09,708 --> 01:03:13,871
Let's complete the set, then.
I'll send the rest of them to you.

440
01:03:14,087 --> 01:03:18,832
Then finish the translation
and transmit the sounds back to me.

441
01:03:30,395 --> 01:03:33,349
We need more back-up.

442
01:03:48,246 --> 01:03:50,203
Smart girl.

443
01:04:14,606 --> 01:04:16,184
Move!

444
01:04:16,399 --> 01:04:21,394
Don't shoot her! Not until we're sure
the computer has done its job.

445
01:04:21,613 --> 01:04:26,239
You honestly believe you'll be able
to control what's in that box?

446
01:04:26,451 --> 01:04:28,693
Really, Lara, you disappoint me.

447
01:04:28,912 --> 01:04:32,115
Have we received payment
from all the buyers?

448
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:39,503
No, you don't want to control it at all.
You're using the buyers.

449
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:44,175
They'll release it as just another
weapon, and the world blames them.

450
01:04:44,386 --> 01:04:47,589
What's left of the world blames them.

451
01:04:49,141 --> 01:04:52,225
Once I have the virus,
I'll make enough antidote

452
01:04:52,435 --> 01:04:54,891
to protect the best and the brightest.

453
01:04:55,147 --> 01:04:59,096
Heads of corporations,
heads of state. Life will go on.

454
01:04:59,317 --> 01:05:01,144
You've never thought,

455
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:04,445
"The world would be better
without certain people"?

456
01:05:04,656 --> 01:05:08,950
I can certainly think of one person
I could do without.

457
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:16,742
There it is.

458
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:21,040
I'm sorry, Lara. You'd have been
welcome in my world.

459
01:05:21,256 --> 01:05:22,834
Piss off.

460
01:05:23,049 --> 01:05:26,418
Shoot her between the eyes.
No mistakes.

461
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:10,179
Asshole!

462
01:06:11,139 --> 01:06:13,677
I'm gonna get you.

463
01:06:13,892 --> 01:06:15,849
Follow me!

464
01:06:33,578 --> 01:06:35,452
You're mine.

465
01:07:24,713 --> 01:07:29,007
Bingo! Two one-way tickets
out of Hong Kong.

466
01:07:31,386 --> 01:07:33,343
Parachutes!

467
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:37,093
Something a little faster.

468
01:07:38,768 --> 01:07:40,927
Come on!

469
01:07:44,483 --> 01:07:48,183
Our rendezvous point is two
and a half, maybe three miles.

470
01:07:48,403 --> 01:07:52,401
You're aware that no one's ever gone
further than one mile?

471
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:55,154
- I am now.
- This way!

472
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:58,868
- Right, you go first.
- No, you go first.

473
01:08:02,292 --> 01:08:04,166
I'll go first!

474
01:08:14,596 --> 01:08:16,221
Holy cow!

475
01:08:17,557 --> 01:08:19,514
Follow her.

476
01:09:40,056 --> 01:09:43,390
Hi, Terry. Good to see you.

477
01:10:01,453 --> 01:10:05,237
I suppose you want paying, then?
We agreed on $200?

478
01:10:05,457 --> 01:10:08,244
No, $300! Expenses.

479
01:11:05,851 --> 01:11:08,057
So this...

480
01:11:10,438 --> 01:11:13,143
...rock is the map?

481
01:11:13,358 --> 01:11:15,018
Yes, it is.

482
01:11:15,235 --> 01:11:18,818
I've never seen anything like it.
Have you?

483
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:22,859
And it's the only way to find that box?

484
01:11:23,076 --> 01:11:26,659
Just think, you could take it
and walk out the door.

485
01:11:26,872 --> 01:11:32,495
No. Window's better,
off the ship faster, harder to track.

486
01:11:34,379 --> 01:11:39,337
Croft, do you really think
I would do that to you?

487
01:12:16,755 --> 01:12:21,713
You can break my wrist,
but I'm still gonna kiss you.

488
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:34,783
Not exactly what I had in mind, but OK.

489
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,203
- Why didn't you shoot Reiss?
- What?

490
01:13:38,420 --> 01:13:43,082
He must have walked
right past you in the lab.

491
01:13:43,300 --> 01:13:45,257
Why didn't you shoot him?

492
01:13:45,469 --> 01:13:48,754
No clear shot.
I didn't know where you were.

493
01:13:48,972 --> 01:13:51,890
I'll inform Ml6 of the completion
of your service.

494
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:55,552
You'll have your money and your life.

495
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:59,934
- Don't waste it.
- This is no time to split up.

496
01:14:00,150 --> 01:14:04,812
Yes, it is, before you make
the wrong decision.

497
01:14:08,492 --> 01:14:11,279
OK, you want to leave? Go ahead.

498
01:14:11,495 --> 01:14:15,195
But don't pretend
it's to try and save me.

499
01:14:15,415 --> 01:14:18,084
You're afraid
you might not pull the trigger.

500
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:22,955
Afraid of letting your guard down,
of letting anyone in.

501
01:14:27,511 --> 01:14:30,180
I'm not leaving
because I couldn't kill you.

502
01:14:30,388 --> 01:14:33,923
I'm leaving because I could.

503
01:15:19,980 --> 01:15:21,640
Good morning.

504
01:15:21,857 --> 01:15:25,023
Might I borrow your television?

505
01:15:25,235 --> 01:15:27,560
It's important.

506
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:30,523
Cheers. Lovely.

507
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:39,801
- Hello, Bryce.
- Hello, Lara.

508
01:16:40,018 --> 01:16:42,591
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

509
01:16:42,813 --> 01:16:48,151
Right. Sending the last images
of the orb... now.

510
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:55,065
Got them.

511
01:16:58,537 --> 01:17:01,740
Translating... Done.

512
01:17:05,252 --> 01:17:07,921
Send the sounds.

513
01:17:08,130 --> 01:17:10,537
Sending it now.

514
01:17:20,142 --> 01:17:22,099
No, nothing.

515
01:17:23,478 --> 01:17:26,432
Oh, well, back to the drawing board.

516
01:17:27,315 --> 01:17:31,693
No, wait. The tones are being distorted.
Send me the file.

517
01:17:31,903 --> 01:17:35,403
Look, Lara, I...
I really don't think that's gonna work.

518
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:40,740
Yes, it will. Ever heard your voice
on a tape recorder? Same thing.

519
01:17:41,788 --> 01:17:47,031
Why are we having this discussion?
Send me the file.

520
01:17:47,252 --> 01:17:50,206
- Sending it.
- Thank you.

521
01:18:58,198 --> 01:18:59,776
Lara!

522
01:19:01,493 --> 01:19:03,818
Lara!

523
01:19:04,037 --> 01:19:06,279
Africa. It's in Africa.

524
01:19:06,498 --> 01:19:10,330
- Somewhere near Kilimanjaro.
- Great, Lara.

525
01:19:10,544 --> 01:19:12,999
How long for Reiss
to fix his computers?

526
01:19:13,213 --> 01:19:15,289
Twenty-four hours at the fastest.

527
01:19:15,507 --> 01:19:18,792
Ask Kosa to meet me
north of his village.

528
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:22,130
0800 hours. Bye, then.

529
01:19:24,975 --> 01:19:28,972
A bit faster than
twenty-four hours, I'd say. Out!

530
01:19:33,942 --> 01:19:35,317
Africa it is.

531
01:19:53,837 --> 01:19:57,621
- Kosa? How are you?
- Lara?

532
01:19:57,841 --> 01:20:02,170
- You had the jeep cleaned.
- I know how you like your equipment!

533
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:06,337
- Where are you? I can't see you.
- Don't worry, I can see you.

534
01:20:06,558 --> 01:20:09,179
Where are you coming from now?

535
01:20:09,394 --> 01:20:12,680
Keep going straight,
keep your speed steady.

536
01:20:16,985 --> 01:20:19,025
Lara! Welcome back!

537
01:20:24,743 --> 01:20:27,448
Do you ever do anything the easy way?

538
01:20:27,662 --> 01:20:30,236
And risk disappointing you?

539
01:20:36,963 --> 01:20:41,091
I've lost my friend and
I'm not sure where to go...

540
01:20:44,471 --> 01:20:46,179
Nice shirt.

541
01:20:46,890 --> 01:20:50,176
She went to Kilimanjaro
to play with the elephants.

542
01:21:05,617 --> 01:21:09,033
Kosa, we've never been here, have we?

543
01:21:09,246 --> 01:21:12,081
We didn't come
to this area before. Why?

544
01:21:12,290 --> 01:21:16,584
I've seen that mountain before.
The box is there somewhere.

545
01:21:16,795 --> 01:21:19,286
The locals call it
"The Mountain of God".

546
01:21:19,506 --> 01:21:24,334
There's a tribe that makes
a home on it that might help us.

547
01:22:07,804 --> 01:22:10,378
Leave this object and go.

548
01:22:10,599 --> 01:22:14,181
Leave this object and go.
And never speak of it.

549
01:22:14,394 --> 01:22:20,682
To trespass on The Cradle of Life is
to risk flooding the world with death.

550
01:22:20,901 --> 01:22:23,189
Men are coming for the box.

551
01:22:23,403 --> 01:22:26,986
Unlike me, they won't look at it
with fear or respect.

552
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:29,737
They will open it. They want to use it.

553
01:22:29,951 --> 01:22:35,372
I'm sorry if I have to disturb your gods
to keep this from happening.

554
01:22:35,582 --> 01:22:39,033
But I will do whatever I must.

555
01:22:50,222 --> 01:22:54,302
Do you truly understand
what you are doing?

556
01:22:54,518 --> 01:23:00,354
Are you truly prepared
for what you are about to learn?

557
01:23:00,565 --> 01:23:03,352
Some secrets must remain secrets.

558
01:23:04,194 --> 01:23:08,655
These are very heavy burdens,
very lonely burdens.

559
01:23:11,868 --> 01:23:15,202
If you find the box,
you will have to carry them.

560
01:23:15,413 --> 01:23:17,786
I am prepared, sir.

561
01:23:21,545 --> 01:23:25,957
He warns that no one who has looked
for the box has come back.

562
01:23:26,174 --> 01:23:30,089
He says the land beyond the canyon
belongs to the Shadow Guardians.

563
01:23:30,303 --> 01:23:32,213
Shadow Guardians?

564
01:23:34,266 --> 01:23:37,017
They do not sleep.

565
01:23:37,227 --> 01:23:41,688
They never rest.
They move like the wind.

566
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:47,903
And anything
that walks their land will die.

567
01:23:48,113 --> 01:23:50,485
And the Cradle itself?

568
01:23:52,409 --> 01:23:54,734
Only with the orb can it be revealed.

569
01:23:54,953 --> 01:23:59,081
Inside you will find a place of madness.
Sky and Earth are one.

570
01:23:59,291 --> 01:24:02,078
Direction, meaningless.

571
01:24:07,048 --> 01:24:11,129
He's going to give us twenty men
to take us as far as they can,

572
01:24:11,344 --> 01:24:15,805
to The Cradle of Life
where the box is hidden.

573
01:24:20,020 --> 01:24:22,143
We're getting closer.

574
01:24:27,068 --> 01:24:32,110
He said you're right.
The Cradle of Life lies near the summit.

575
01:24:32,949 --> 01:24:35,950
- He wants to know how you knew.
- The orb.

576
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,623
He says he will not turn back with
the others. He'll go as far as we go.

577
01:24:47,839 --> 01:24:53,296
- He will fight the Shadow Guardians.
- You're a very brave man.

578
01:24:54,971 --> 01:24:57,011
What is he saying?

579
01:24:57,224 --> 01:25:00,178
That your accent is funny.

580
01:25:33,343 --> 01:25:34,671
Get down!

581
01:25:37,013 --> 01:25:39,136
Get down!

582
01:25:41,518 --> 01:25:44,187
Back! Back!

583
01:25:54,948 --> 01:25:56,691
Back! Get back!

584
01:26:15,135 --> 01:26:20,093
Thank you, Lara, for leading us here
and for finding the orb.

585
01:26:20,307 --> 01:26:22,976
However, you have seen
the exact position.

586
01:26:23,185 --> 01:26:25,557
You could save me hours, days even.

587
01:26:25,770 --> 01:26:29,436
Help me, I'll make it worth your while.

588
01:26:30,901 --> 01:26:32,229
No.

589
01:26:32,444 --> 01:26:36,394
Think of what I'm offering you.
Let her go.

590
01:26:37,199 --> 01:26:40,153
A chance to find out how it all began.

591
01:26:40,368 --> 01:26:43,820
Life, Lara, the origin of what we are.

592
01:26:44,039 --> 01:26:46,993
Don't tell me you're not tempted.

593
01:26:48,001 --> 01:26:53,208
- That's what got Pandora into trouble.
- They told me you wouldn't do it.

594
01:26:53,423 --> 01:26:59,378
And I told them you would, rather than
lose two of your closest friends.

595
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:04,974
- Take us to The Cradle of Life.
- I'm sorry, Lara.

596
01:27:05,185 --> 01:27:09,135
It's your destiny to see what's inside.

597
01:27:09,356 --> 01:27:13,685
He is right. It's just beyond
the canyon, remember?

598
01:27:13,902 --> 01:27:17,852
Such a short walk
might save your friends.

599
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:25,611
Well, if it spares my friends...
I'm up for a walk.

600
01:28:01,074 --> 01:28:03,067
I'm sure she'd understand.

601
01:28:03,285 --> 01:28:08,445
You should've told her we were hostage.
He'd never have found her.

602
01:28:22,387 --> 01:28:26,681
I don't suppose either of you
know how to fly a helicopter?

603
01:28:26,892 --> 01:28:28,718
I can.

604
01:28:28,935 --> 01:28:31,094
- What?
- What?

605
01:28:31,313 --> 01:28:36,687
I've got over 150 hours between
flight simulation games, models...

606
01:28:38,361 --> 01:28:40,935
And in the real thing?

607
01:28:41,156 --> 01:28:43,777
- Two.
- Two?

608
01:28:43,992 --> 01:28:50,280
You're only gonna fly it once I'm out,
so remember your two hours well!

609
01:29:23,448 --> 01:29:26,402
It's through here?

610
01:29:28,411 --> 01:29:30,285
Move, baby.

611
01:30:58,877 --> 01:31:00,834
What was that?

612
01:31:01,713 --> 01:31:04,334
You! Check it out!

613
01:31:07,594 --> 01:31:09,005
Keep moving!

614
01:31:54,266 --> 01:31:58,560
What are you doing?
Back in formation now!

615
01:32:50,155 --> 01:32:51,815
Holy shit!

616
01:32:53,033 --> 01:32:56,733
Don't!
They seem to react to movement.

617
01:33:14,679 --> 01:33:16,637
They're gone.

618
01:33:19,351 --> 01:33:24,309
We're close. I've seen it in your eyes.
Take me to Pandora's box.

619
01:33:24,523 --> 01:33:28,141
- I don't know how.
- Do it now!

620
01:33:29,820 --> 01:33:35,194
You were the one who wanted
to go for a walk. So start walking!

621
01:33:41,331 --> 01:33:44,285
The next one will be higher.

622
01:34:22,205 --> 01:34:25,657
Only with the orb can it be revealed.

623
01:34:26,835 --> 01:34:30,085
Only with the orb can it be revealed.

624
01:34:33,758 --> 01:34:36,380
All right. I'll need the orb.

625
01:34:37,846 --> 01:34:40,598
Do you want to see
The Cradle of Life or not?

626
01:34:40,807 --> 01:34:44,010
You tell me what to do with it.

627
01:35:40,784 --> 01:35:43,536
Don't think you can outwit me, Croft.

628
01:35:43,745 --> 01:35:46,580
Oh, do shut up!

629
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:51,248
So, this is The Cradle of Life...

630
01:35:58,218 --> 01:36:00,175
Here we are.

631
01:36:01,346 --> 01:36:04,300
It's all yours. Time to be a hero.

632
01:37:08,205 --> 01:37:10,244
There it is.

633
01:37:21,426 --> 01:37:26,633
Perfect, isn't it? All that power
in such a banal container.

634
01:37:26,848 --> 01:37:32,554
When Pandora saw inside the box,
she cried black acid for tears.

635
01:37:32,771 --> 01:37:36,104
And, as it was a woman
who found the box,

636
01:37:36,316 --> 01:37:39,899
I see no reason to break with tradition.

637
01:37:40,111 --> 01:37:42,863
A woman should collect the box.

638
01:37:44,866 --> 01:37:46,491
Go on!

639
01:37:49,663 --> 01:37:52,747
It is impossible to reach.

640
01:37:54,084 --> 01:37:56,041
Now take it!

641
01:37:57,129 --> 01:37:59,205
Take it!

642
01:39:28,678 --> 01:39:31,300
I don't think so, Reiss!

643
01:40:26,069 --> 01:40:27,896
You OK?

644
01:40:28,655 --> 01:40:32,867
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- There you go.

645
01:40:38,665 --> 01:40:42,793
- You come prepared.
- I know how clumsy you are.

646
01:40:47,215 --> 01:40:49,671
Hillary and Bryce?

647
01:40:50,594 --> 01:40:52,882
They're fine.

648
01:41:06,776 --> 01:41:08,603
Thank you.

649
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:10,694
What was that?

650
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:15,657
Thank you.

651
01:41:28,173 --> 01:41:31,043
Let's get out of here.

652
01:41:40,227 --> 01:41:43,761
Terry? What are you doing?

653
01:41:45,106 --> 01:41:48,143
You're joking, right?

654
01:41:48,360 --> 01:41:51,693
We're taking this with us. This is ours.

655
01:41:52,989 --> 01:41:57,069
You're not walking out of here
with that box.

656
01:41:58,203 --> 01:42:02,781
So you're saying we just leave it,
when it's worth a fortune?

657
01:42:02,999 --> 01:42:05,490
- Put it back.
- I don't think so.

658
01:42:05,710 --> 01:42:08,498
It could kill millions
of innocent people.

659
01:42:08,713 --> 01:42:12,296
- Now you're being dramatic.
- Put it back.

660
01:42:12,509 --> 01:42:14,169
No!

661
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:22,350
I've helped you keep this away
from Reiss. This is my reward.

662
01:42:23,395 --> 01:42:26,349
I'm taking it with me.

663
01:42:35,407 --> 01:42:38,194
So it's come to this, has it?

664
01:42:38,410 --> 01:42:41,909
Well, you do have
authorisation to kill me.

665
01:42:42,998 --> 01:42:45,323
Better do it, then.

666
01:42:45,542 --> 01:42:51,212
'Cause if you think standing
in front of me is gonna be enough...

667
01:42:52,632 --> 01:42:56,547
You don't have it in you to stop me.

668
01:43:04,478 --> 01:43:07,051
See, all your beliefs...

669
01:43:07,272 --> 01:43:11,317
...all your ideals, they're not real.

670
01:43:12,027 --> 01:43:15,645
I am. And you've loved me.

671
01:43:19,117 --> 01:43:25,037
You think you're strong,
but you'll not choose them over me.

672
01:43:28,752 --> 01:43:31,706
- Now move.
- No.

673
01:43:35,634 --> 01:43:37,092
Fine.

674
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:07,741
The box is safe now.

675
01:46:09,287 --> 01:46:12,988
Some things are not meant to be found.

676
01:46:22,634 --> 01:46:25,469
Didn't you ever do anything
the easy way?

677
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:28,633
I wouldn't want to disappoint you.

678
01:46:53,081 --> 01:46:55,619
- Lara, are you OK?
- All right?

679
01:46:55,834 --> 01:46:59,084
This is... very touching.

680
01:46:59,296 --> 01:47:02,996
You know us, always making friends,
having a laugh.

681
01:47:03,216 --> 01:47:05,209
Getting married...

682
01:47:06,428 --> 01:47:08,385
What?

683
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:12,140
This is a wedding ceremony
and you are the grooms.

684
01:47:12,767 --> 01:47:15,721
Good luck, boys!

685
01:47:32,204 --> 01:47:33,828
Go!
