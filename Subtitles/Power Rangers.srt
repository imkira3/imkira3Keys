(ZORDON) Yes. Yes, very good, Billy.

You must never use your powers
for personal gain.

You must never escalate a fight,
unless your enemy forces you to.

And you must never reveal
your identity. Ever.

you need to morph.

(ZORDON) You already have it
inside of you.

from this wall.

1158
01:04:17,550 --> 01:04:22,386
Yes, but the irony is,
is that you need these rangers to morph.

1159
01:04:22,470 --> 01:04:24,462
If they morph, you can harness that energy

1160
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:26,940
to regenerate your body
and come back through.

(ZACK) What, Zordon? You can't what?

1163
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:35,386
Wait for us dumb kids to morph
so that you can come back to life?

That's what all this
has been about, right?

01:04:39,110 --> 01:04:42,148

about protecting the crystal.

and life on earth will die.

And we need you.

1171

Because you were so successful
at stopping her last time.

1172
01:04:57,350 --> 01:05:00,309
I died burying those coins

in hopes that they would find
the next real rangers.

But my mom, she's sick.

1248
01:09:25,110 --> 01:09:26,669
I do what I can, but...

1249
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,020
but I'm scared.

1250
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:32,989
Sometimes I get too scared
to stay there at night, 'cause...

1251
01:09:34,190 --> 01:09:36,830
'cause I'm afraid she can't make it.

1252

And if she goes...

1253

being with you guys is good for me.

Let's tell our secrets.
It'll... it'll help us.

1258
01:10:02,630 --> 01:10:03,746
Okay, I got a secret.

1259
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:08,069
- I like country music.
- (CHUCKLES) What?

1260
01:10:08,150 --> 01:10:09,869
No, matter of fact, I love country music.

And I don't...

1263
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:15,910
I don't miss my dad as much.

1264
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,747
I mean, coming to the mine
with him was all I had.

1265
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:26,587
But coming to the mine
with you guys is just as good.

1266
01:10:26,670 --> 01:10:28,389
Yeah.

1267
01:10:28,470 --> 01:10:30,701
Bigger secret is why
were you in detention?

1268
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:32,827
- I blew up my lunchbox.
- What?

1269
01:10:32,910 --> 01:10:35,186
- What, it was a accident, okay?
- (ALL LAUGHING)

1270
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:38,104
- Of course.
- (BILLY) My lunchbox was in my locker.

1271
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:40,580
Boom goes the lunchbox,
in detention goes Billy.

1272
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:44,584
But let's not forget that Kimberly Hart
was also in... in detention, too, so...

1273
01:10:47,750 --> 01:10:48,945
Not tonight.

1274
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:51,260
Skip me.

1275
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:55,620
What about you, dude?

1276
01:10:56,630 --> 01:10:58,781
Why don't you tell us who you really are?

1277
01:10:58,870 --> 01:11:01,180
Because everyone knows exactly who I am.

1278
01:11:01,310 --> 01:11:03,745
Okay.

1279
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:04,946
What about you, crazy girl?

1280
01:11:05,030 --> 01:11:08,148
I could tell you anything
and you'd have to believe me.

1281
01:11:13,110 --> 01:11:15,386
Okay, um...

1282
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:18,622
I'm the new girl. Always.

Three schools in three years.

What's crazy is I like it that way.
You know, it's just easier.

1285
01:11:27,590 --> 01:11:30,025
Nobody ever has to get to know me and uh,

1286
01:11:30,110 --> 01:11:33,581
my parents don't have to worry
about my relationships.

Yeah. Boyfriend troubles.

Girlfriend troubles?

My family is so normal.

1291
01:11:54,670 --> 01:11:55,820
Too normal.

1292
01:11:59,030 --> 01:12:00,623
They believe in labels.

1293
01:12:02,870 --> 01:12:07,547
They'd like for me to, um...
dress differently.

1294
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:10,190
Talk more.

1295

Have the kind of friends
they want me to have.

1296

I was the meanest person he'd ever met.

But she shared it with me.
Privately. She trusted me.

Okay, the only reason Zordon
wanted us to become Power Rangers

is so that he can come back to life.
