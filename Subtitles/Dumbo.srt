1
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:34,361
Through the snow and sleet and hail...

2
00:01:34,445 --> 00:01:37,765
...through the blizzard,
through the gale...

3
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:41,018
...through the wind and through the rain...

4
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:44,038
...over mountain, over plain...

5
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:47,399
...through the blinding lightning flash...

6
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:51,045
...and the mighty thunder crash...

7
00:01:51,128 --> 00:01:55,299
...ever faithful, ever true...

8
00:01:55,382 --> 00:01:57,718
...nothing stops him.

9
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,887
He'll get through.

10
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:08,837
Look out for Mr. Stork
that persevering chap

11
00:02:08,937 --> 00:02:12,466
He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap

12
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:15,886
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which

13
00:02:15,986 --> 00:02:19,515
Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker

14
00:02:19,615 --> 00:02:23,143
So look out for Mr. Stork
and let me tell you, friend

15
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:27,331
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end

16
00:02:27,373 --> 00:02:30,568
He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork

17
00:02:30,668 --> 00:02:34,046
So you'd better look out for Mr. Stork

18
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:26,123
Look out for Mr. Stork
He's got you on his list

19
00:03:26,223 --> 00:03:29,877
And when he comes around
it's useless to resist

20
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,547
Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe

21
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:37,067
Maybe he's got his eye on you

22
00:05:23,716 --> 00:05:26,051
All aboard. All aboard.

23
00:05:26,135 --> 00:05:29,972
All aboard. Let's go.

24
00:05:52,578 --> 00:05:55,189
Casey Junior's comin' down the track

25
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:59,209
Comin' down the track with a smoky stack

26
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:01,987
Hear him puffiin' comin' round the hill

27
00:06:02,087 --> 00:06:05,966
Casey's here to thrill every Jack and Jill

28
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:09,161
Every time his funny little whistle sounds

29
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:12,576
Everybody hurries to the circus grounds

30
00:06:12,598 --> 00:06:15,251
Time for lemonade and Cracker Jack

31
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:18,687
Casey Junior's back Casey Junior's back

32
00:06:33,702 --> 00:06:36,080
Oh. My, my.

33
00:06:37,623 --> 00:06:40,584
Now let me see.

34
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:43,796
Must be right around here somewhere.

35
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,256
I hope.
Ah, watch it there.

36
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:57,142
On the treetop

37
00:07:00,938 --> 00:07:03,399
Where are we here?
Oh, here.

38
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:08,195
Highway 61, four miles to the gas station

39
00:07:08,278 --> 00:07:12,032
Turn left Da-da da-da-da de

40
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,703
Ah. That must be it.

41
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,264
Well, little fella,
let's get goin'.

42
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:46,233
Mrs. Jumbo. Oh, Mrs. Jumbo.

43
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:48,317
Calling Mrs. Jumbo.

44
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:52,362
Mrs. Jumbo?

45
00:07:54,033 --> 00:07:56,033
Oh. My.

46
00:07:58,203 --> 00:08:00,873
Mrs. Jumbo.

47
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:08,280
Oh, where's that Mrs. Jum...
- Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.

48
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,949
Over here.
- This way, boy.

49
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:11,784
In here. In here.
- Yoo-hoo.

50
00:08:11,884 --> 00:08:15,596
This is the place.
- Whew. At last.

51
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:18,974
Which one of you ladies is expecting?

52
00:08:19,058 --> 00:08:21,977
Hmph. Not me.
- The very idea.

53
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:24,797
Certainly not.
Over there, of course.

54
00:08:24,897 --> 00:08:27,174
Yes, of course.
Right over there.

55
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:30,653
Oh. Of course.

56
00:08:38,243 --> 00:08:40,312
Here is a baby with eyes of blue...

57
00:08:40,412 --> 00:08:43,557
...straight from heaven right to you.

58
00:08:44,583 --> 00:08:48,003
Or: Straight from heaven up above...

59
00:08:48,087 --> 00:08:50,977
...here is a baby for you to love.

60

Uh, yeah. Well... Oh. Mrs. Jumbo.

62
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:08,656
Uh, one moment, please.
This is still part of the service.

63
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,152
Happy Birthday to you

Oh, do hurry, dear.

Isn't it thrilling?

75
00:09:53,986 --> 00:09:57,740
Ah, this is a proud, proud day.

Well, hurry and open it, dearie.

78
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,543
Look at him.

Oh, what a... Oh, look.

80
00:10:11,837 --> 00:10:16,133
Oh, you sweet little thing.

81
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:19,178
Oh, he is a darling little baby.

82
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:22,931
Adorable. Simply adorable.

83
00:10:23,015 --> 00:10:26,160
Did you ever see anything so cunning?

84
00:10:26,185 --> 00:10:28,312
Isn't he a darling.

85
00:10:28,354 --> 00:10:32,774
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy,

Oh.

00:10:44,203 --> 00:10:47,273
Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?

88
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:50,209
Just look at those, those...

89
00:10:50,292 --> 00:10:53,087
E-A-R-S.

90

Those what? Oh, ears.

91
00:10:56,882 --> 00:11:00,678
These. Aren't they funny? Oh.

92
00:11:00,719 --> 00:11:03,163
Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.

93
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,999
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.

94
00:11:05,099 --> 00:11:07,251
Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.

95
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:08,961
I just said that they're funny,
and they are funny.

96
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:11,255
They certainly are.
- After all, who cares...

97
00:11:11,355 --> 00:11:13,632
...about her precious little Jumbo?

98
00:11:13,732 --> 00:11:17,319
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.

99
00:11:17,403 --> 00:11:19,530
Dumbo.

100
00:11:21,407 --> 00:11:23,993
Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.

101
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:27,204
Dumbo. That's good.
- Dumbo.

102
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:15,694
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

103

105
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:28,057
Whoo-woo.

Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike

107
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:30,603
We work all day We work all night

108
00:13:30,703 --> 00:13:32,563
We never learned to read or write

109
00:13:32,663 --> 00:13:36,041
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

110

Hike, ugh, hike, ugh hike, ugh, hike

111
00:13:41,171 --> 00:13:43,616

00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:45,659
We slave until we're almost dead

113

We don't know when we get our pay

116
00:13:56,729 --> 00:13:59,465
And when we do we throw our pay away

117
00:13:59,565 --> 00:14:03,177
When we get our pay
we throw our money all away

118
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,346
We get our pay when children say

119
00:14:05,446 --> 00:14:08,098
With happy hearts It's circus day today

120
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:11,977
Then we get our pay
just watching kids on circus day

121
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:16,165
Muscles aching Back near breaking

00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,550
Calm down. Tie her down.

162
00:20:33,709 --> 00:20:35,836
Darling, it was so funny.

163
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,155
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

164
00:20:38,255 --> 00:20:42,034
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

165
00:20:42,134 --> 00:20:44,870
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.

166
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:47,373
After all, one mustn't forget one is a lady.

167
00:20:47,473 --> 00:20:49,166
Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.

168
00:20:49,266 --> 00:20:51,627
Oh, well, I suppose that's mother love.

169
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:54,046
But it's certainly no excuse
for what she did.

170
00:20:54,146 --> 00:20:57,174
Mother love might cover a multitude of sins.

171
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:59,677
It's true, my dear,
and she has such a streak in...

172
00:20:59,777 --> 00:21:01,720
A guy can't eat in peace.

173
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,806
Yes, but mother love does...

174
00:21:03,906 --> 00:21:06,100
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.

175
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,620
Girls, girls. Listen.

176
00:21:09,703 --> 00:21:12,064
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

177
00:21:12,164 --> 00:21:15,067
Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

178
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:19,738
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

179
00:21:19,838 --> 00:21:21,882
No.
- You don't mean it.

180
00:21:21,965 --> 00:21:24,468
Oh, how awful for her.

181
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:27,329
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.

182
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:31,208
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...

183
00:21:31,308 --> 00:21:34,353
F-R-E-A-K.

184
00:21:34,436 --> 00:21:39,026
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

185
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,094
What's the matter with his ears?

186
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:46,473
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.

187
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:50,019
Ladies, ladies.
It's no laughing matter at all.

188
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:52,414
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

189
00:21:52,454 --> 00:21:56,942
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

190
00:21:57,042 --> 00:21:59,445
His disgrace is our own shame.

191
00:21:59,545 --> 00:22:01,488
Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

192
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:06,285
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat
at the same bale of hay with him.

193
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:07,703
No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

194
00:22:07,803 --> 00:22:10,497
I should say.
- Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

195
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:13,017
Here he comes now.

196
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:16,812
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

197
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:19,440
Shh.

198
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:26,774
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

199
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,701
Poor little guy.

200
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:35,122
There he goes,
without a friend in the world.

201
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,001
Nobody to turn to.

202
00:22:40,836 --> 00:22:44,214
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

203
00:22:49,261 --> 00:22:51,261
A mouse.

204
00:22:56,393 --> 00:22:58,379
So ya like to pick on little guys, huh?

205
00:22:58,479 --> 00:23:01,148
Well, why don't you pick on me?

206
00:23:07,738 --> 00:23:09,990
A proud race.

207
00:23:10,074 --> 00:23:12,326
Overstuffed hay bags.

208
00:23:23,545 --> 00:23:26,048
Boo.

209
00:23:26,131 --> 00:23:28,759
Still afraid of a mouse.

210
00:23:28,801 --> 00:23:32,037
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.

211
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:34,890
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

212
00:23:34,974 --> 00:23:37,643
You can come out now.

213
00:23:37,726 --> 00:23:41,146
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

214
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,424
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

215
00:23:43,524 --> 00:23:45,524
Come on out, won't ya?

216
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:51,271
You're not really afraid of little me, are ya?

217
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:54,560
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.

218
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,805
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

219
00:23:59,748 --> 00:24:02,459
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

220
00:24:06,505 --> 00:24:09,591
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.

221
00:24:15,681 --> 00:24:18,000
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought...

222
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:22,922
...uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

223
00:24:23,022 --> 00:24:27,952
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

224
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:34,616
Well, that's more like it.

225
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,328
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

226
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:39,788
She's just brokenhearted.

227
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:43,782
It ain't nobody's fault you got them big ears.

228
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:47,087
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

229
00:24:47,171 --> 00:24:52,134
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

230
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:56,121
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

231
00:24:56,221 --> 00:25:00,125
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

232
00:25:00,225 --> 00:25:03,504
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.

233
00:25:03,604 --> 00:25:06,649
Make ya a star. A headliner.

234
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:09,026
Dumbo the Great.

235
00:25:12,112 --> 00:25:14,865
Uh-oh. The great what?

236
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,871
Ya know, Dumbo,
we gotta get an idea.

237
00:25:20,913 --> 00:25:24,858
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...

238
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:28,712
Have I got an idea.
What an idea.

239
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,990
Huh. He never had an idea in his life.

240
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:35,427
Just visualize: One elephant climbs up...

241
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:38,747
...on top of another elephant until finally...

242
00:25:38,847 --> 00:25:41,100
...all 17 elephants...

243
00:25:41,183 --> 00:25:44,587
...have constructed an enormous pyramid...

244
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:46,772
...of pachyderms.

245
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:49,358
I step out.

246
00:25:49,441 --> 00:25:51,441
I blow the whistle.

247
00:25:51,443 --> 00:25:53,846
Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

248
00:25:53,946 --> 00:25:55,806
Yeah.
- And now...

249
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:58,242
...comes the climax.

250
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:02,204
Yeah? What is the climax?

251
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:04,748
Hmm. I don't know.

252
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,170
I knew he never had nothin'.

253
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:10,170
Well, maybe it comes to me...

254
00:26:10,254 --> 00:26:13,924
...in a vision while I dream.

255
00:26:13,966 --> 00:26:16,410
Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

256
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,510
Climax.

257
00:26:19,805 --> 00:26:23,642
Climax. Dumbo, you're a climax.

258
00:26:25,144 --> 00:26:30,244
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

259
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:28,666
I am the voice of your subconscious mind.

260
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:32,294
Your inspiration.

261
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:34,922
Now, concentrate.

262
00:27:37,966 --> 00:27:39,660
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants...

263
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,871
...are standing in the
ring waitin' for a climax.

264
00:27:41,971 --> 00:27:45,849
Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

265
00:27:45,891 --> 00:27:47,877
Climax.
- How's the reception?

266
00:27:47,977 --> 00:27:51,188
Comin' through okay? Good.

267
00:27:51,271 --> 00:27:53,716
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.

268
00:27:53,816 --> 00:27:56,135
Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.

269
00:27:56,235 --> 00:27:58,679
Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

270
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:00,222
...to a platform.

271
00:28:00,322 --> 00:28:03,559
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid,
he waves a flag...

272
00:28:03,659 --> 00:28:05,352
...for a glorious finish.

273
00:28:05,452 --> 00:28:09,456
Finish?
- And who is your climax?

274
00:28:10,582 --> 00:28:12,443
The little elephant with the big ears.

275
00:28:12,543 --> 00:28:17,965
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon. Dumbo.

276
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,048
What?

277
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:22,511
Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

278
00:28:22,594 --> 00:28:24,888
Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

279
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,225
Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

280
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:30,311
I got it. I got it.

281
00:28:31,603 --> 00:28:34,648
Ladies and gentlemen...

282
00:28:34,732 --> 00:28:38,135
...we will now present
for your entertainment...

283
00:28:38,235 --> 00:28:41,572
...the most stupendous, magnificent...

284
00:28:41,655 --> 00:28:44,992
...super-colossal spectacle.

285
00:28:45,075 --> 00:28:47,411
On this tiny...

286
00:28:47,494 --> 00:28:50,539
...little, insignificant ball...

287
00:28:50,622 --> 00:28:52,816
...we will construct for you...

288
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:56,837
...a pyramid, not of wood,
not of stone...

289
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,865
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

290
00:28:59,965 --> 00:29:02,826
but a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

291
00:29:02,926 --> 00:29:06,889
pyramid of ponderous, pulsating...

292
00:29:06,972 --> 00:29:11,435
...pulchritudinous pachyderms.

293
00:29:12,728 --> 00:29:14,853
I give you the elephants.

294
00:29:40,255 --> 00:29:42,255
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

295
00:29:50,683 --> 00:29:53,502
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

296
00:29:53,602 --> 00:29:56,981
You're no cream puff yourself, dearie.

297
00:29:57,064 --> 00:30:00,464
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.

298
00:30:13,914 --> 00:30:17,876
Take your foot out of my eye,
clumsy ox.

299
00:30:23,841 --> 00:30:25,884
Steady, girls.

300
00:30:34,184 --> 00:30:36,645
Boy, that was a close one.

301
00:30:36,729 --> 00:30:40,257
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

302
00:30:40,357 --> 00:30:43,260
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.

303
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,971
Now, look. All ya gotta do is run out, see?

304
00:30:46,071 --> 00:30:48,115
Jump on the springboard.

305
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:51,977
All right, now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

306
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:55,189
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.

307
00:30:55,289 --> 00:30:57,650
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh. Dumbo.

308
00:30:57,750 --> 00:31:01,490
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.

309
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,841
Ladies and gentlemen...

310
00:31:05,883 --> 00:31:08,827
...you have now seen the impossible...

311
00:31:08,927 --> 00:31:11,330
...accomplished in front of your faces.

312
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:14,099
Seven jungle giants...

313
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:16,085
...each one weighing not...

314
00:31:16,185 --> 00:31:17,753
That windbag.

315
00:31:17,853 --> 00:31:20,673
Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds.

316
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:23,067
And now, I present...

317
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:26,387
...the world's smallest little elephant...

318
00:31:26,487 --> 00:31:30,449
...who will spring from this springboard...

319
00:31:30,532 --> 00:31:32,618
...in one spring...

320
00:31:32,701 --> 00:31:36,689
...to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

321
00:31:36,789 --> 00:31:40,084
...for a grand climax.

322
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,628
Ladies and gentlemen...

323
00:31:42,711 --> 00:31:46,006
I give you Dumbo.

324
00:31:56,809 --> 00:31:59,144
Go on. Get goin'.

325
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:02,464
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo. That's your cue.

326
00:32:02,564 --> 00:32:04,566
You're on, Dumbo.

327
00:33:05,169 --> 00:33:07,838
Out of my way, assassin.

328
00:34:12,403 --> 00:34:14,571
Dear.
- Ohh.

329
00:34:14,655 --> 00:34:18,867
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

330
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:23,564
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

331
00:34:23,664 --> 00:34:26,917
Oh, look at my beautiful tail.

332
00:34:27,001 --> 00:34:30,529
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him...

333
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:34,591
Ah. Oh. Oh. Ohh.

334
00:34:34,633 --> 00:34:38,846
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.

335
00:34:38,929 --> 00:34:41,390
They fixed him good.

336
00:34:41,473 --> 00:34:43,375
What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

337
00:34:43,475 --> 00:34:45,169
Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

338
00:34:45,269 --> 00:34:47,796
Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

339
00:34:47,896 --> 00:34:52,067
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...

340
00:34:52,109 --> 00:34:55,012
Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it.

341
00:34:55,112 --> 00:34:57,906
Made him a clown.

342
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,990
A clown?

343
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:02,828
No.
- Yes.

344
00:35:02,911 --> 00:35:06,582
Oh, the shame of it.

345
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:09,168
Let us take the solemn vow.

346
00:35:11,295 --> 00:35:15,007
From now on, he is no longer...

347
00:35:15,090 --> 00:35:17,090
...an elephant.

348
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:30,272
Please. Help me save my poor baby.

349
00:35:30,314 --> 00:35:34,109
Whoo. Save my child.

350
00:35:44,453 --> 00:35:46,438
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Where are you? Yoo-hoo.

351
00:35:46,538 --> 00:35:49,166
Yoo-hoo. Yoo-hoo.

352
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:51,460
Hey. Hey. Hey.

353
00:36:18,445 --> 00:36:20,447
Save my ba...

354
00:36:34,795 --> 00:36:37,114
Come on. Jump.
- We'll save you. Hurry up.

355
00:36:37,214 --> 00:36:39,158
Hurry up.
- We'll save you. Go on.

356
00:36:39,258 --> 00:36:41,677
Jump.
- We'll save ya.

357
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:00,554
Whew. Boy, oh, boy,
did we wow 'em out there.

358
00:37:00,654 --> 00:37:02,556
What a performance.
- Are we good?

359
00:37:02,656 --> 00:37:04,391
Thirteen curtain calls.
Thirteen.

360
00:37:04,491 --> 00:37:06,435
Yeah, sure brought down
the house, all right.

361
00:37:06,535 --> 00:37:09,647
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.

362
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:11,649
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.

363
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:14,026
Boy, oh, boy, what an act.
- Oh, 'what an act' is right.

364
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:15,736
Stupendous, I call it.

365
00:37:15,836 --> 00:37:17,655
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.

366
00:37:17,755 --> 00:37:19,823
Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

367
00:37:19,923 --> 00:37:22,493
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

368
00:37:22,593 --> 00:37:25,788
Poison. Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

369
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,790
This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

370
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,226
Dumbo.
- Here's plaster in his eyes.

371
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,963
See? They're drinkin' a toast to ya.

372
00:37:34,063 --> 00:37:36,231
Yeah. You're a big hit.

373
00:37:40,653 --> 00:37:42,821
Why, uh, you're terrific.

374
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:47,710
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

375
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:52,731
Come on. Alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.

376
00:37:52,831 --> 00:37:54,917
You ought a be proud.

377
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,169
You're a success.

378
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:04,593
Look. A peanut.

379
00:38:04,677 --> 00:38:07,822
Come on. Eat it.
Got lots of vitamins.

380
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:12,601

381
00:38:15,688 --> 00:38:17,840
Oh-ho-ho.

382
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:19,842
Why, we're goin' over to see your mother.

383
00:38:19,942 --> 00:38:22,136
I made an appointment for ya.
Didn't I tell ya? Huh.

384
00:38:22,236 --> 00:38:26,911
Just like me. I must have forgot.
Come on. Get your hat.

385
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:35,249
Oh. Right over there.

386
00:38:35,332 --> 00:38:37,712
Cozy little place, ain't it?

387
00:38:44,883 --> 00:38:48,721
Mrs. Jumbo. I hope she's in.

388
00:38:49,805 --> 00:38:52,725
Someone to see ya.

389
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:24,798
Baby mine

390
00:39:24,882 --> 00:39:29,345
Don't you cry

391
00:39:29,428 --> 00:39:32,473
Baby mine

392
00:39:32,556 --> 00:39:37,186
Dry your eyes

393
00:39:37,269 --> 00:39:39,897
Rest your head

394
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:42,066
Close to my heart

395
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:44,360
Never to part

396
00:39:44,443 --> 00:39:47,196
Baby of mine

397
00:39:48,614 --> 00:39:51,659
Little one

398
00:39:51,742 --> 00:39:55,871
When you play

399
00:39:55,954 --> 00:39:58,957
Don't you mind

400
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:03,212
What they say

401
00:40:03,295 --> 00:40:06,048
Let those eyes

402
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:07,992
Sparkle and shine

403
00:40:08,092 --> 00:40:10,511
Never a tear

404
00:40:10,594 --> 00:40:15,015
Baby of mine

405
00:40:44,169 --> 00:40:47,172
From your head

406
00:40:47,256 --> 00:40:49,033
To your toes

407
00:40:49,133 --> 00:40:52,094
Baby mine

408
00:40:52,177 --> 00:40:57,099
You're so sweet goodness knows

409
00:40:57,182 --> 00:41:00,436
Baby mine...

410
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:03,272
You are so
- Baby, baby, baby...

411
00:41:03,314 --> 00:41:05,090
Precious to me
- Mine

412
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:09,945
Cute as can be baby of mine

413
00:41:09,987 --> 00:41:12,239
Baby mine

414
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:20,080
Baby mine

415
00:41:33,218 --> 00:41:36,372
Here ya are.
Pour it in me slipper, Joey.

416
00:41:36,472 --> 00:41:39,416
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

417
00:41:39,516 --> 00:41:42,586
Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

418
00:41:42,686 --> 00:41:45,130
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

419
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:47,800
Yeah. If they laugh when he jumps 20 feet...

420
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,719
...they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

421
00:41:50,819 --> 00:41:53,806
Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

422
00:41:53,906 --> 00:41:57,476
Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

423
00:41:57,576 --> 00:41:59,520
Make it 300.
- A thousand.

424
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,356
Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

425
00:42:02,456 --> 00:42:04,400
You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

426
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:07,361
Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

427
00:42:07,461 --> 00:42:10,239
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

428
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:11,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

429
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,617
Hey, hey.
Let's hit him for a raise.

430
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:15,953
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.

431
00:42:16,053 --> 00:42:19,793
Oh, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise

432
00:42:19,807 --> 00:42:23,377
Yes, we're gonna hit the big boss for a raise

433
00:42:23,477 --> 00:42:27,339
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny

434
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:30,839
We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise

435
00:42:36,115 --> 00:42:39,852
I know how ya feel, Dumbo,
but you gotta pull yourself together.

436
00:42:39,952 --> 00:42:43,939
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

437
00:42:44,039 --> 00:42:47,014
Remember, you come of a proud race.

438
00:42:48,252 --> 00:42:50,571
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm...

439
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:52,573
...and pachyderms don't cry.

440
00:42:52,673 --> 00:42:57,093
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

441
00:42:57,970 --> 00:42:59,970
There. Ya see?

442
00:43:04,018 --> 00:43:08,230
Well, ain't nothin' a little water won't cure.

443
00:43:08,314 --> 00:43:12,309
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya
fixed up in a jiffy.

444
00:43:12,318 --> 00:43:14,318
Come on.

445
00:43:18,949 --> 00:43:21,076
Here. Take a trunk full.

446
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:25,162
Listen, little fella.

447
00:43:25,164 --> 00:43:27,900
We may have had a lot
of hard luck up till now...

448
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:31,237
...but you and me is gonna do
big things together.

449
00:43:31,337 --> 00:43:35,199
Hold your breath. Why, your mother's
gonna be so proud of ya.

450
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:36,909
I'm gonna be proud of ya too.

451
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:40,162
The whole circus is gonna be proud
of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

452
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:42,264
Swallow it.

453
00:43:42,348 --> 00:43:44,983
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

454
00:43:47,144 --> 00:43:49,505
Oh, I guess you had one little one left over.

455
00:43:49,605 --> 00:43:53,025
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...

456
00:43:53,108 --> 00:43:56,028
Hey, what's the matter with you?

457
00:44:01,950 --> 00:44:04,925
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

458
00:44:58,007 --> 00:45:00,926
Balloonies.

459
00:45:01,010 --> 00:45:03,012
Hiya, George.

460
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:26,035
Whee.

461
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,837
That's a pretty schstrick schlick.

462
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:42,051
All right. Let's see ya
blow a square one, pal.

463
00:45:49,099 --> 00:45:52,394
Say, that's very, very clever.

464
00:45:52,478 --> 00:45:57,024
Now blow a great big one.

465
00:46:19,088 --> 00:46:21,298
That's a pretty sh... Hey.

466
00:46:25,511 --> 00:46:27,972
Dumbo.

00:46:28,055 --> 00:46:30,557
You see what I see?

468
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,046
Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade

469
00:47:42,129 --> 00:47:44,531
Here they come Hippity-hoppity

470
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:48,761
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

471
00:47:48,844 --> 00:47:51,055
Look out, look out

472
00:47:51,138 --> 00:47:53,958
They're walking around the bed
on their head

473
00:47:54,058 --> 00:47:57,019
Clippity-cloppity Arrayed in braid

474
00:47:57,061 --> 00:47:59,480
Pink elephants on parade...

475
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:01,549
What'll I do
- What'll I do

476
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:03,901
What an unusual view

477
00:48:03,984 --> 00:48:07,846
I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs

478
00:48:07,946 --> 00:48:12,451
But Technicolor pachyderms
is really too much for me

479
00:48:12,534 --> 00:48:14,436
I am not the type to faint

480
00:48:14,536 --> 00:48:16,522
When things are odd or things are quaint

481
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:18,649
But seein' things you know there ain't

482
00:48:18,749 --> 00:48:21,277
Can certainly give you an awful fright

483
00:48:21,377 --> 00:48:24,321
What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away

484
00:48:24,421 --> 00:48:28,200
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade...

485
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,765
Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants

486
00:48:31,845 --> 00:48:33,973
Pink elephants

487
00:48:34,056 --> 00:48:36,056
Pink elephants...

488
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,457
Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

489
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,443
Why, this is most irregular.

490
00:51:07,543 --> 00:51:10,112
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

491
00:51:10,212 --> 00:51:15,092
They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

492
00:51:15,175 --> 00:51:17,511
Or do they?

493
00:51:19,096 --> 00:51:21,081
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.

494
00:51:21,181 --> 00:51:25,294
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

495
00:51:25,394 --> 00:51:27,463
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?

496
00:51:27,563 --> 00:51:33,088
Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

497
00:51:37,948 --> 00:51:41,268
Well, hush my beak.
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

498
00:51:41,368 --> 00:51:43,479
Yeah. Find out what they're doin' up here.

499
00:51:43,579 --> 00:51:45,689
Yeah.
- And 'ax' them what they want.

500
00:51:45,789 --> 00:51:48,125
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

501
00:52:12,316 --> 00:52:16,403
Ohh. Those pink elephants.

502
00:52:16,487 --> 00:52:19,365
Ho. Pink elephants? Mm-mmm.

503
00:52:23,243 --> 00:52:27,064
What's so funny? What are you boys
doin' down here, anyway?

504
00:52:27,164 --> 00:52:29,275
What are we doin' down here?

505
00:52:29,375 --> 00:52:31,375
Well, hear him talk.

506
00:52:31,377 --> 00:52:34,522
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.

507
00:52:36,298 --> 00:52:38,784
Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

508
00:52:38,884 --> 00:52:42,162
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

509
00:52:42,262 --> 00:52:44,974
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

510
00:52:45,015 --> 00:52:48,836
...and no elephant ain't up in no tree, either.

511
00:52:48,936 --> 00:52:52,506
No. No, me and no tree ain't up no... Huh?

512
00:52:52,564 --> 00:52:54,650
Tree?

513
00:52:57,277 --> 00:52:59,363
Yo.

514
00:53:00,614 --> 00:53:03,117
Dumbo.

515
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,786
Dumbo. Wake up.

516
00:53:05,869 --> 00:53:08,747
Wake up, Dumbo.

517
00:53:08,831 --> 00:53:12,741
Don't look now,
but I think we're up in a tree.

518
00:53:41,655 --> 00:53:44,308
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

519
00:53:44,408 --> 00:53:47,519
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

520
00:53:47,619 --> 00:53:49,663
So long, boy.

521
00:53:57,504 --> 00:54:01,924
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree, anyway.

522
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:05,596
Now, let's see.

523
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:08,207
Elephants can't climb trees,
can they?

524
00:54:08,307 --> 00:54:10,851
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

525
00:54:10,934 --> 00:54:14,004
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.

526
00:54:14,104 --> 00:54:17,249
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.

527
00:54:17,858 --> 00:54:21,737
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...

528
00:54:21,779 --> 00:54:24,865
That's it. Dumbo. You flew.

529
00:54:24,948 --> 00:54:27,518
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

530
00:54:27,618 --> 00:54:30,980
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.

531
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:35,693
The very things that held ya down
are gonna carry ya up and up and up.

532
00:54:35,793 --> 00:54:38,087
I can see it all now.

533
00:54:38,128 --> 00:54:40,698
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder of the Universe.

534
00:54:40,798 --> 00:54:43,603
The world's only flyin' elephant.

535
00:54:46,095 --> 00:54:48,038
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

536
00:54:48,138 --> 00:54:51,709
Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

537
00:54:51,809 --> 00:54:54,954
Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah.

538
00:54:55,729 --> 00:54:57,840
See, I've seen all that too.

539
00:54:57,940 --> 00:55:01,552
I've seen a peanut stand
and heard a rubber band.

540
00:55:01,652 --> 00:55:04,555
I seen a needle that winked its eye.

541
00:55:04,655 --> 00:55:08,075
But I be done seen about ever'thing

542
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:10,352
When I see a elephant fly...

543
00:55:10,452 --> 00:55:14,231
What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly

544
00:55:14,331 --> 00:55:17,776
I seen a front porch swing
heard a diamond ring

545
00:55:17,876 --> 00:55:20,671
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie

546
00:55:20,754 --> 00:55:24,466
But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

547
00:55:24,508 --> 00:55:26,702
When I see a elephant fly...

548
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:29,705
Da da-da-da
- Da-da-da do-do-dow wow...

549
00:55:29,805 --> 00:55:32,683
Da da-da-da
- Hey, wow

550
00:55:32,766 --> 00:55:35,377
I saw a clotheshorse He rear up and buck

551
00:55:35,477 --> 00:55:38,756
And they tell me that a man
made a vegetable truck

552
00:55:38,856 --> 00:55:41,817
I didn't see that I only heard

553
00:55:41,859 --> 00:55:44,511
Just to be sociable I'll take your word...

554
00:55:44,611 --> 00:55:47,765
I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat

555
00:55:47,865 --> 00:55:50,809
And I just laughed till I thought I'd die

556
00:55:50,909 --> 00:55:54,580
But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

557
00:55:54,663 --> 00:55:57,750
When I see a elephant fly

558
00:55:57,833 --> 00:56:01,253
Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do

559
00:56:10,179 --> 00:56:13,641
But I be done seen 'bout ever'thing

560
00:56:13,724 --> 00:56:18,103
When I see a elephant fly

561
00:56:18,187 --> 00:56:21,315
With the wind.

562
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:25,944
When I see a elephant

563
00:56:26,028 --> 00:56:28,572
Fly

564
00:56:36,205 --> 00:56:40,540
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

565
00:56:44,171 --> 00:56:45,864
Quiet, gentlemen.

566
00:56:45,964 --> 00:56:48,617
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

567
00:56:48,717 --> 00:56:51,887
You ought a be ashamed of yourselves.

568
00:56:51,971 --> 00:56:54,248
A bunch of big guys like you...

569
00:56:54,348 --> 00:56:57,626
...pickin' on a poor little orphan like him.

570
00:56:57,726 --> 00:57:01,964
Suppose you was torn away from
your mother when you was just a baby...

571
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:04,466
...nobody to tuck you in at nights...

572
00:57:04,566 --> 00:57:09,446
...no warm, soft, caressin' trunk
to snuzzle into.

573
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,849
How would you like to be left out alone...

574
00:57:11,949 --> 00:57:15,327
...in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

575
00:57:15,411 --> 00:57:18,664
And why? I ask ya, why?

576
00:57:18,747 --> 00:57:22,735
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

577
00:57:22,835 --> 00:57:24,945
The laughingstock of the circus.

578
00:57:25,045 --> 00:57:27,615
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...

579
00:57:27,715 --> 00:57:30,075
...they threw her into the clink.

580
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:33,971
And on top of that,
they made him a clown.

581
00:57:34,054 --> 00:57:36,974
Socially, he's washed up.

582
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:41,212
Ah, but what's the use of talkin'
to you coldhearted birds?

583
00:57:41,312 --> 00:57:43,522
Go ahead. Have your fun.

584
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:46,634
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.

585
00:57:46,734 --> 00:57:49,194
Go on.

586
00:57:49,278 --> 00:57:51,278
We don't care.

587
00:57:58,370 --> 00:58:00,370
Come on, Dumbo.

588
00:58:05,794 --> 00:58:08,030
Hey, brother,
w-w-wait a minute.

589
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:10,699
Uh, don't go away feelin' like that.

590
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,010
We done seen the light.

591
00:58:13,093 --> 00:58:15,093
You boys is okay.

592
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:17,289
Please, you've done enough.

593
00:58:17,389 --> 00:58:21,710
Well, but we're all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

594
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,046
Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.

595
00:58:24,146 --> 00:58:27,007
You wanna make the elephant fly,
don't ya?

596
00:58:27,107 --> 00:58:30,553
Well, you gotta use a lot of' choplogic.
You know, psychology.

597
00:58:30,653 --> 00:58:33,722
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...

598
00:58:33,822 --> 00:58:35,822
Uh, bu...

599
00:58:35,824 --> 00:58:38,969
And then, right after that,
you, uh...

600
00:58:41,246 --> 00:58:44,124
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?

601
00:58:44,208 --> 00:58:46,794
The magic feather?

602
00:58:46,877 --> 00:58:48,877
Yeah, I gotcha.

603
00:58:48,879 --> 00:58:52,508
Dumbo. Look. Have I got it.

604
00:58:52,591 --> 00:58:55,511
The magic feather.
Now you can fly.

605
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:03,185
Let's go. Let's go.

606
00:59:03,268 --> 00:59:06,730
Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

607
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:10,067
Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.

608
00:59:10,150 --> 00:59:12,052
Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.

609
00:59:12,152 --> 00:59:14,346
One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

610
00:59:14,446 --> 00:59:16,724
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.

611
00:59:16,824 --> 00:59:19,268
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.

612
00:59:19,368 --> 00:59:21,368
Take off.

613
00:59:28,585 --> 00:59:30,585
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

614
00:59:30,629 --> 00:59:33,073
I guess it's just another one of their... Look.

615
00:59:33,173 --> 00:59:35,884
Hot diggity. You're flyin'.

616
00:59:35,968 --> 00:59:37,968
You're flyin'.

617
00:59:40,472 --> 00:59:44,059
Uh, why, he flies just like a eagle.

618
00:59:44,143 --> 00:59:46,462
That's better than a airplane.

619
00:59:46,562 --> 00:59:49,452
Brother, now I've seen everything.

620
00:59:51,108 --> 00:59:54,528
But I be done seen about everything

621
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:59,033
When I see a elephant fly

622
00:59:59,116 --> 01:00:01,160
With the wind.

623
01:00:01,243 --> 01:00:05,247
When I see a elephant

624
01:00:05,331 --> 01:00:07,958
Fly

625
01:00:08,042 --> 01:00:10,627
Dumbo, I knew you could do it.

626
01:00:10,711 --> 01:00:13,630
Wait'll we get to the big town.

627
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:17,624
Boy, them city folks is
sure in for a surprise.

628
01:00:28,687 --> 01:00:31,565
Poor baby. Whoo.

629
01:00:33,567 --> 01:00:36,262
Come on. Jump. Come on.

630
01:00:36,362 --> 01:00:38,264
Hurry up.
- We'll save ya.

631
01:00:38,364 --> 01:00:41,241
Come on. Jump.
- Come on.

632
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:45,162
Look at that house.
Dumbo,

633
01:00:45,245 --> 01:00:48,232
you're standing
on the threshold of success.

634
01:00:48,332 --> 01:00:50,776
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.

635
01:00:50,876 --> 01:00:54,546
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.

636
01:00:55,631 --> 01:00:59,760
Got the magic feather? Good.

637
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:06,392
Okay. Contact.

638
01:01:06,475 --> 01:01:08,475
Take off.

639
01:01:12,648 --> 01:01:15,109
Uh-oh. The magic feather.

640
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:22,950
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.

641
01:01:24,159 --> 01:01:27,062
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.

642
01:01:27,162 --> 01:01:30,165
Honest, you can.
Hurry. Open 'em up.

643
01:01:31,166 --> 01:01:33,166
Please.

644
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:43,846
Whee. We did it. We did it.

645
01:01:43,929 --> 01:01:46,765
Let's show 'em, Dumbo.
Power dive.

646
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:02,614
Now, loop the loop.

647
01:02:32,353 --> 01:02:35,189
You're makin' history.

648
01:02:57,544 --> 01:03:00,072
I've seen a peanut stand
heard a rubber band

649
01:03:00,172 --> 01:03:02,533
I've seen a needle that winked its eye

650
01:03:02,633 --> 01:03:05,302
But I be done seen

651
01:03:05,386 --> 01:03:08,222
About everything

652
01:03:08,305 --> 01:03:11,850
When I see an elephant fly...

653
01:03:11,892 --> 01:03:15,896
Oh, my
- When I see

654
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:18,565
When I see

655
01:03:18,649 --> 01:03:22,569
When I see an elephant fly...

656
01:03:22,653 --> 01:03:27,574
Mmm, look at him go.
- When I see an elephant fly...

657
01:03:27,616 --> 01:03:29,560
Happy landin', son.
- Yippee.

658
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:32,997
When I see a elephant fly

659
01:03:33,080 --> 01:03:35,274
I wish I'd have got his autograph.

660
01:03:35,374 --> 01:03:37,109
Oh, man, I got his autograph.

661
01:03:37,209 --> 01:03:39,586
Well, so long, glamour boy.
