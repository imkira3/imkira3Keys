2
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,884
You having fun, sweetheart?

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,053
Yes.

4
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,847
Ahh.

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,850
Well, I hope you're doing
better than me, baby.

6
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,436
- What are you making?
- A necklace for Mom.

7
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,688
Yeah? Let me see.

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,066
Wow. Another one?

9
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,693
- Yes.
- Honey?

10
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,528
That's two today.

11
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:13,405
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,990
Honey?

13
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:17,785
- Yeah?
- Waiting for the help to get that?

14
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,704
I thought you and I were the help.

15
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,793
- Go wash up for dinner, pumpkin.
- Okay.

16
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,420
Mmm, smells nice.
That takeout?

17
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:31,965
Mommy, look at-

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,850
No!

19
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:44,353
No! Ahh!

20
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:52,027
Oh! No no no!

21
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,655
You can't fight fate.

22
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,253
We gotta get the fuck out of here.
Come on!

23
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,882
Oh! Oh no!

24
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,304
No!

25
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,182
- What the fuck are you doing?
- No!

26
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:24,643
Fucking stop!
Let's go!

27
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,812
Just shut the fuck up!

28
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,154
No!

29
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,664
It's cool.

30
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,332
Kids like me.

31
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,502
No! Heather!

32
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,049
No no!

33
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,691
- Nick.
- Bray, what's happenin'?

34
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:58,111
Willis is a rowing buddy of mine.
Where are we on his kid's case?

35
00:03:58,279 --> 00:03:59,696
- Willis?
- Yeah.

36
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,615
- Oh, I kicked it down to juvie.
- Why did you do that?

37
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,700
'Cause the case was a dog.
The kid was only 15 years old

38
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:05,494
when he committed the murder.

39
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,497
You wouldn't want to jeopardize
your 95% conviction rate.

40
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,624
- It's actually 96%.
- 96% now?

41
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:13,126
Yes. You gotta keep your books
better than that.

42
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,673
You know, if I didn't know any better,
I'd say you were gunning for my job.

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,299
You do know better.

44
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,802
And you know that I'm aiming
much higher than that.

45
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,513
They filed a motion to dismiss,

46
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,515
but there's no way that
Judge Abrams honors it.

47
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:27,891
I think that we can
get him on RICO.

48
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,560
All that time and that's
what you come back with, Sarah?

49
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:33,563
You might want to reevaluate
your research skills.

50
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,565
- What else have we got?
- She's right.

51
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,858
Mr. Rice?

52
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,485
RICO's designed
for this kind of thing.

53
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,071
Check out section 901 of
the Organized Crime Control Act.

54
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,448
And you should let Sarah
try this case too.

55
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,618
Mr. Rice, last I checked,
I was running this room.

56
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,121
She's already done the leg-work.
I'll oversee it.

57
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,081
I mean, Helen Keller
could try this case.

58
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,836
Okay, Boy Wonder,
she fucks up, it's on you.

59
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,927
Cantrell wants to see you.

60
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,387
All right, I'll be right there.

61
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,057
No, Nick.
He wants to see Nick.

62
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,768
You still torturing Bringham?

63
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,146
Let's just say I'm less impressed
with his Harvard degree than he is.

64
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,647
Well, we can't all have
gone to Fordham.

65
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:17,065
I went to Fordham night school.

66
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,443
You know what I learned
in Fordham night school?

67
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,902
Law school's got nothing
to do with law.

68
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,322
Guess you skipped the course
on inter-office politics.

69
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,241
All I need is a jury to like me.
Isn't that what you told me, Jonas?

70
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:29,286
The Shelton case-
where are we?

71
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,163
It went sideways last night-
Judge Burch.

72
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,706
Ahh.

73
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,666
Bad news. What now?

74
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,544
- Let's make the deal.
- They killed a little girl, Nick.

75
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,589
- It's an imperfect system.
- And we its imperfect servants.

76
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,343
- However you could win this case.
- No, can't take that chance.

77
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,137
Some justice is better
than no justice at all.

78
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,306
You need to tell the husband.

79
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,683
Okay.
That's part of my job.

80
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,811
Good, because he's waiting
for you right now.

81
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,646
What?

82
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:08,825
- How are you doing?
- Good. How are you doing?

83
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:11,578
Good. Sit. Sit.

84
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,247
Well, I didn't hear back from you

85
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,584
and made some notes
on the case.

86
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:20,670
I had some good ideas.

87
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,506
Yeah, let me
take a look at it.

88
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:25,884
Well, they're just-

89
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,517
I was gonna talk to you
about those.

90
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,895
Do you trust me?

91
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,942
Do you trust me, Clyde?

92
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:44,694
Yeah, of course.

93
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,575
Darby has agreed to testify
against Ames.

94
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,328
With Darby's testimony,

95
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,288
Ames will go
to death row.

96
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:03,296
Um, what about-
what about Darby then?

97
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,967
Darby will plead
guilty to murder.

98
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,803
- In what degree?
- Third.

99
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,431
He serves, what?
Five years...

100
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,183
at best?

101
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,228
I don't understand.
I'm sorry.

102
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:22,232
We had a setback. The judge ruled
that the DNA was inadmissible.

103
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,360
- What?
- Exclusionary rule.

104
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,362
The opposing counsel
maneuvered it.

105
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,698
You said this part of
the case was clear-cut.

106
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,366
We had the blood on his shirt-

107
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,201
It's covered under
the same rule.

108
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,703
What about the rest of
the forensic evidence?

109
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,498
It's not conclusive, Clyde.

110
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,087
Okay, that's okay.
'Cause I saw- I saw their faces.

111
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:47,299
I saw them do it.
I mean, he killed my little girl, Nick.

112
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,343
You blacked out, Clyde.
Your testimony won't be reliable.

113
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:53,263
You get on the stand and
the defense will tear you apart.

114
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:55,849
No no, the jury's gonna
believe me though.

115
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:59,144
- Because it's the truth! We can-
- We can lose.

116
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,063
And then we'd have nothing.

117
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,608
You will waste a whole year,
spend millions of dollars,

118
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,693
and then both of them could
end up going free.

119
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:10,405
Nick, both of them are guilty,
especially Darby!

120
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,574
- You know that.
- It's not what you know, Clyde.

121
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:15,160
It's what you can
prove in court.

122
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,416
Please don't make a deal
with this man.

123
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,627
Please don't make a deal with this man.
He's a monster-

124
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,296
I'm sorry, the deal is done.
I'm sorry.

125
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,298
I made the deal.

126
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,426
What?
How could you do that?

127
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:35,180
This is just how
the justice system works.

128
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,434
Listen, I know you don't
think it right now,

129
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,354
but this is a victory for us.

130
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,276
Your office has certified
this agreement?

131
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:49,694
Yes, Your Honor.

132
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:53,740
Mr. Reynolds, any great insights
to share with the court today?

133
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,910
I'm a defense attorney, Your Honor.
I don't have many of those.

134
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,166
No, Your Honor.
No insights.

135
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:06,127
Good, then I trust that we can
move forward with Mr. Ames's trial

136
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:09,798
unimpeded by continuances.
A trial date is imminent.

137
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,761
Yeah?

138
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,305
There's no cell phones
in my courtroom, Mr. Rice.

139
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,807
- We've been over this-
- I'm sorry.

140
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:20,100
- and over this, over this...

141
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:22,936
Yeah, I had some
exigent business I-

142
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:25,063
Next time it's mine.

143
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:31,736
- Ah, you married?
- Excuse me?

144
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:33,905
Are you married?

145
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:39,035
Please fuck this up
so I can destroy you.

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,876
I wish ill for no man,

147
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:50,714
but Ames deserves to
suffer for what he did.

148
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:54,050
I mean, you can't
fight fate, right?

149
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,266
Nick.

150
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,019
Once you make a decision,
live with it- move on.

151
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:06,354
This job, your best asset's
a short memory.

152
00:10:06,522 --> 00:10:09,566
Don't beat yourself up. Too many other
people out there doing that already.

153
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:10,984
Look, there's some of them
right now.

154
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:14,112
Isn't this where you tell me
some type of old fable

155
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,073
or wives' tale-

156
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,075
All right, all right, I got one.

157
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,161
Marcus Aurelius hired a servant
to walk behind him

158
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,912
as he made his way through
the Roman town square.

159
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,165
And this servant's only job

160
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:28,001
was to whisper in his ear
when people praised him,

161
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:31,463
"You're only a man.
You're only a man. "

162
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,048
- Okay, man?
- Okay, man.

163
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,466
- Okay, man.
- That's some bullshit.

164
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,634
That's good.

165
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,093
I don't think you even know
what that story means.

166
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:39,387
You're missing the point, Nick.
It doesn't matter what they say.

167
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:41,056
Okay, I got this now.

168
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,853
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
one at a time, one at a time.

169
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,772
So you'll be seeking
the death penalty?

170
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,940
- For Rupert Ames, we will be.
- And for Darby?

171
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,610
He has pled guilty to murder,
but he is a cooperating witness.

172
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,154
The DA's office has committed
all of its resources

173
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,823
to ensure that justice
will be served.

174
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,659
Did you make any kind of-

175
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:02,577
Do you think this is
a fair sentence for Darby?

176
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,125
I just wanted to say
thanks for being in my corner.

177
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:12,295
It's nice when
the system works, right?

178
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,589
Get away from me.

179
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:17,092
Move. Move.

180
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:24,349
Let's go.

181
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,298
- Nick?
- Hey.

182
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,105
Nuh-uh, what happened?

183
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,524
What happened to what?

184
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,861
What's wrong?

185
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,198
You call my job boring. "C-"?

186
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:23,908
Yes.

187
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,163
Well...
okay now...

188
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,206
you gonna tell me
what's wrong?

189
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,918
Can I talk to my daughter
for a little bit?

190
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,046
- Oh, please. No no no.
- Gonna lay down.

191
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,549
Please?

192
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,843
First of all,
this is your father speaking.

193
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,720
- Yeah, she didn't know that.
- You never know.

194
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,681
I want you to stay in there
as long as you can.

195
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,017
'cause there's a lot
of crazy-ass people out here.

196
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,935
Language.

197
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:54,147
Your mother's a hardass, but-

198
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:55,565
I'm right here.

199
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:59,319
And Daddy- Daddy wants you to
come out and be Daddy's little girl.

200
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,155
I want her to come out
'cause she's on my bladder.

201
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,157
Ahh!

202
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,786
Anybody seen my phone?

203
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,502
- Hey, have you seen my phone?
- It's not strapped to your hand?

204
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,629
No, it's not strapped to my hand.

205
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,506
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

206
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,132
You're not gonna have
some of my French toast?

207
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,051
- French toast? You made French toast?
- Mm-hmm.

208
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:26,095
I can't, honey.
I'm running late.

209
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,514
Okay.

210
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,767
All right, here- Mmm.

211
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,560
- Mmm, that's good.
- Thank you.

212
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,770
- You did this by yourself?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:13:33,938 --> 00:13:35,647
I'm just gonna take
this whole plate to work.

214
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,274
All right- no.

215
00:13:38,442 --> 00:13:40,109
You're only 10 years old?

216
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,278
- You better than your mother.
- I heard that.

217
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:45,031
Smells good in here.
Your lifeline.

218
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,033
'Morning, baby.
Give me a kiss.

219
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,245
Mmm! You going to your daughter's
recital this afternoon?

220
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:55,124
Um, I thought you were gonna
order the DVDs.

221
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:56,960
Video's not the same, Nick.

222
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:00,129
Mom, it's okay.
Dad's got to work, I know.

223
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,174
See? It's all right. Dad's got to work.
And what is Dad doing today?

224
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,009
- Lock up bad guys.
- And why does he do that?

225
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,511
- To keep us safe.
- Yeah.

226
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,597
She understands.
'Cause he wants us to be safe.

227
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,558
- Baby, get your cello.
- All right.

228
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,768
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

229
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,813
- Little Julia Child.
- Mmm.

230
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,525
You know she's
10 years old, right?

231
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,943
- You know that?
- I know that.

232
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,653
She doesn't understand why
you're never around.

233
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,822
This good-guy, bad-guy stuff-
that's just talk to her.

234
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,657
Don't do this, come on.

235
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,534
I can't come today.

236
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,870
You know you have not been
to one recital-

237
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,621
- How many has she had?
- Enough.

238
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,124
Okay.
Well, we'll get the video,

239
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:40,420
we'll sit down and we'll
watch it together as a family.

240
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,714
I love you.

241
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,173
All right?

242
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,426
- Thank you for the toast.
- Love you.

243
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:47,719
- Love you too!
- Bye.

244
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,804
Love you.

245
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,848
Huh.

246
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:54,767
- So how's Chip?
- It's Chester.

247
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,311
What happened to Chip?
I liked Chip.

248
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,104
There is no Chip.

249
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,648
And now there's no Chester.
He kept calling.

250
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,151
- Sarah, that's a good thing.
- I know, but I kept cancelling.

251
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,153
My caseload's crazy.

252
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,989
You know you don't have to
go to this if you don't want to.

253
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,700
Yeah, I do. I...

254
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,285
What's it like?

255
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,746
No biggie.
Like watching somebody fall asleep.

256
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,915
Except for
the not-waking-up part.

257
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,917
Does it bother you?

258
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,668
Not anymore.

259
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:09,759
Sarah, your legs are looking
real good in those heels.

260
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,012
Fuck off.

261
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,807
What are you doing here, Reynolds?
Your DVD player broken?

262
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,394
Ames has no family. I felt like
someone should be here for him.

263
00:16:19,561 --> 00:16:21,980
Wow, that's nice.

264
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,151
Breathe.

265
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:47,797
Rupert Ames, do you have
anything you want to say?

266
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:50,925
Yeah.

267
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,343
Uh-huh.

268
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,141
What I did that night was wrong.

269
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:02,061
I should have never been there.

270
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,858
But I swear to God,
I didn't kill those people.

271
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:13,448
The wrong man's dying here today.

272
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,746
The wrong man's dying.

273
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,998
That's all.

274
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,483
Look at me.

275
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:51,819
Look at me!

276
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:55,716
Ahh! Fuck!

277
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,262
Fuck!

278
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:02,431
Ahh! Fuck!

279
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,225
Oh, God.

280
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,728
- Oh, God.
- Take her- take her out.

281
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,106
- What the hell is going on?
- I don't know.

282
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:15,403
Ahhh!

283
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:43,764
What could have caused
the unexpected reaction of the inmate?

284
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,933
We'll keep you informed.

285
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:48,352
You okay? Huh?

286
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,188
Yeah.

287
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,150
So somebody killed the guy
you were trying to kill?

288
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:55,568
What are we calling this?

289
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,361
Clear violation of his
Eighth Amendment rights-

290
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,322
- cruel and unusual punishment.
- Law school.

291
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,699
Yeah. The machine-
how does it work on a good day?

292
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,035
It's designed to be pain-free.

293
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,746
It's three drugs administered
in a specific order.

294
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:09,081
From this point on, we're operating
under the assumption

295
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,666
that the machine was corrupted.

296
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,753
We're gonna need a list of all
the people with access to that machine.

297
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:16,505
- My people would not do this.
- I appreciate that, Warden,

298
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,051
but I'm gonna need more than
a hall pass and a note from Mom.

299
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:22,261
Detectives, got this off
the back of the machine.

300
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,680
- Check it out.
- Let me see it.

301
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,807
Right there.

302
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,809
"Can't fight fate. "

303
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,645
What is it, Nick?

304
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,064
During the home invasion,
Ames's accomplice

305
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:35,399
said to one of the vics,
"You can't fight fate. "

306
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:38,861
And then he said the same thing
to me in the courtroom- prick.

307
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:41,739
I can't remember his name, though.

308
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,450
Have a look at this-
your guy?

309
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,827
Clarence James Darby.
- He's a cutie.

310
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,913
- You got history with him?
- Put him away.

311
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:51,791
All right, three years. That the going
rate for murder these days?

312
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,501
There was extenuating
circumstances.

313
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:56,963
The only extenuating circumstances
should be he didn't do it.

314
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,840
Still, three years at Marion?
Fucking gladiator academy.

315
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,801
You expect him to come back
a model citizen?

316
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,387
Well, if you scholars wouldn't
contaminate the crime scenes,

317
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:05,930
I could keep them
locked up longer.

318
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,140
Authorities have refused
to comment at this point,

319
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,268
but foul play cannot be ruled out.

320
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,979
The prisoner had been on death row
for the past 10 years-

321
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,605
his name, Rupert Ames.

322
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:16,148
All we know at this point

323
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,609
is what was supposed to be
a painless execution

324
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,570
has turned into something
out of a horror film.

325
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,870
Yeah?

326
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,123
- Clarence Darby?
- Who's this?

327
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:35,293
That's strike three for you:
coke on the table,

328
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,045
bitch on the floor- life in prison.

329
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:41,674
Who the fuck is this?

330
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,552
Look out your window,
south side.

331
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,681
- Is this a joke? Get up!
- Ahh!

332
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,100
South side.

333
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,897
Motherfucker.

334
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,859
Shit. Out of the way!

335
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,081
- Stay down!
- You're all crazy!

336
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:17,001
He's heading north!
Go go!

337
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,962
- Damn.
- Move it, move it. Go on!

338
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,848
- What now?
- Wipe the prints off the gun.

339
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:33,142
- Get rid of it.
- No no.

340
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,021
You fired six times, genius.
You bring any ammunition?

341
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:38,898
- Lose it.
- Why are you doing this?

342
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,733
I want to keep you
out of prison.

343
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,652
See the abandoned factories?
Go toward them.

344
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
Why?

345
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,781
There's a cop car there
with a cop in it.

346
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,115
What the fuck?

347
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,910
I Tasered him, but he'll be waking up
in about 90 seconds,

348
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,912
so you'd better move.

349
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,058
Rise and fucking shine, bitch.
Wake the fuck up!

350
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,060
Let's go!
Start the fucking car!

351
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,311
- Okay!
- Do it.

352
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,772
- Take it easy, take it-
- Come on!

353
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,607
- Okay, let's go.
- Take it easy.

354
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:24,652
Let's go!
Get in gear, shithead, now!

355
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,154
Do it! Go go go!

356
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,880
Get the fuck out.

357
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,304
Let's go.

358
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:54,432
Get the fuck down there!

359
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:58,602
Okay. What about my wife?
My little girl?

360
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,981
- I'll never see them again.
- Fucked up, ain't it?

361
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,025
Oh oh oh.

362
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,611
You don't mind if
I take this, do you?

363
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,030
My guardian angel.

364
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:12,032
I am impressed.

365
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,245
You know why I'll never see
my wife and little girl again?

366
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:23,210
'Cause you took 'em from me.

367
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,595
You remember me?

368
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,182
Sure you do.

369
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:39,059
You came over to my house
once before.

370
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:41,270
You don't remember?

371
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:47,651
This tetrodotoxin...

372
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,155
should be nicely into
your system by now.

373
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:55,075
It's isolated from the liver
of a Caribbean puffer fish.

374
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:58,829
So it paralyzes you,

375
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,041
but leaves all the other
neurological functions

376
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,084
perfectly intact.

377
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:07,588
In other words, you can't move...

378
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,300
but you feel everything.

379
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:16,805
It does absolutely nothing
to blunt the pain.

380
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,767
And you're about to
experience more of that

381
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:22,311
than you could ever
fucking imagine.

382
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,739
These are tourniquets

383
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,993
so you don't bleed out,
'cause you may be here a while.

384
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,246
Saline solution-

385
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,957
that should keep us going.

386
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,211
Clamps- nice and secure.

387
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:51,257
Comfortable?

388
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:54,051
You really are shaking.

389
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,470
Sure you're all right?

390
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:00,891
You'll love this-

391
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,143
adrenaline.

392
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:07,398
Now this is so you
don't pass out.

393
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,151
There you go.

394
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:14,488
How's that feel? Good?

395
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,118
Now what we don't want
is you swallowing your tongue,

396
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,412
so bear with me.

397
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:31,297
Now this is for your penis,
but we'll get to that later.

398
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,176
Scalpel...

399
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,304
for your eyelids,

400
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:41,307
in case you insist
on fucking shutting them.

401
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,519
You see,

402
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:49,356
I know what it feels like
to be helpless.

403
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,943
just like when I watched you
slaughter my whole family.

404
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:59,283
You know you can't
fight fate, right, Darby?

405
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:02,536
Oh!

406
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:07,124
And look-
I made this especially for you.

407
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:13,422
You like it? Yeah,
I didn't want you to miss anything.

408
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:19,094
Now you have the best
view in the house.

409
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,138
You hear that?

410
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:24,516
Your heart is beating so fast.

411
00:27:26,353 --> 00:27:28,646
No, me too.

412
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,272
Okay.

413
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:36,362
Now they get to
watch you suffer.

414
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:41,742
They'll be the last thing
you ever see

415
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:45,204
as I cut off every single one
of your fucking limbs.

416
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:48,666
See, I wasn't lying

417
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,544
when I told you that I wanted
to keep you out of prison.

418
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,591
That was the truth.

419
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,963
Thanks for the car.

420
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:04,199
Okay, these are all
the case files on Darby.

421
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,035
I vetted through what I could.
We have crime-scene photos-

422
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:09,037
Don't need to see 'em.

423
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,749
Okay.

424
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:20,215
- What's bothering you?
- It's Darby.

425
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:23,218
All the crimes he's committed
have one thing in common,

426
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,554
and that was violence.
But yesterday at that execution,

427
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,723
- that wasn't violence. That was-
- What?

428
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,184
- That was intellect.
- Okay.

429
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,520
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

430
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,357
I'm just thinking maybe
we shouldn't be looking for Darby.

431
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,078
Jesus Christ.

432
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,384
Rice.

433
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,471
Good news, Counselor. We found Darby.

434
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,724
I gotta say though,
he's looked better.

435
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,645
They found him in about 25 pieces:

436
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:18,273
no legs, no arms,
eyelids were sliced off- gruesome.

437
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:20,275
Shedding tears for Darby?
- Not quite.

438
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:23,445
I see your wheels turning.
Think motive- who has one?

439
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,281
The husband, the father.
What do we know about him?

440
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,200
He owned the warehouse
where they found Darby.

441
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,701
- What else?
- He's a tinkerer-

442
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:33,622
uh, little inventions, gizmos.
He holds two dozen patents

443
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,374
that made him some money.

444
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:38,377
He liquidated most of
his wealth a few years ago

445
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:42,172
to buy some industrial
properties around airports,

446
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,216
chemical plants,
rail yards.

447
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,885
- It doesn't add up.
- No, it's weird, right?

448
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,512
Search 'em all, Sarah.
See what you find.

449
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,674
Freeze!

450
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,928
- Get down, go!
- On your knees!

451
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,723
- Face down, face down!
- Pull him down and cuff him!

452
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:54,054
Crazy men scare
the shit out of me.

453
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,348
Is this guy a lawyer?

454
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,975
No.

455
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,770
He's an engineer.

456
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,982
Nick, look at this.

457
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:45,105
We have zero evidence.
Gonna need a confession.

458
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:47,024
He give you any trouble
on the way in?

459
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:48,400
No, nothing.

460
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:51,319
He wasn't too happy when
we took his bracelet, though.

461
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,789
- Can I help you?
- Package for the Rice family.

462
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:05,876
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

463
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:11,256
Mom, the video from my recital came.
Can we watch it?

464
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,967
- Please?
- No, not you.

465
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,720
No, please, we said we were
gonna wait for your father, remember?

466
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,972
- Please?
- No, not now.

467
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,224
Okay.

468
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,770
Uh-huh, yes.

469
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,774
Yes, absolutely.

470
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,878
Mommy!

471
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:09,106
Don't worry, he's just disarming
the guy, letting him feel easy.

472
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:13,485
What I'm about to tell you
I don't want anybody else to hear.

473
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,404
As a prosecutor, I'm breaking
all the rules right now,

474
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,282
and I don't give a damn
because I'm a father.

475
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,368
I have a little girl.

476
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:25,288
And what you did... bravo.

477
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:31,461
The world is better
without Darby and Ames.

478
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:36,133
You're not gonna see a tear shed
from me or anybody in my office.

479
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:43,515
With that being said...

480
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,892
I have a job to do.

481
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:50,522
I'm gonna ask you some very simple
and direct questions.

482
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,568
I suggest that you
answer them in the same fashion.

483
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,736
Is your name Clyde Alexander Shelton?

484
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:58,822
Yes, sir.

485
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,740
And you've waived
your right to counsel, correct?

486
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,703
- Yes, sir.
- You sure you want to do that?

487
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,079
Yes.

488
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,666
Did you murder Clarence Darby?

489
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,628
I wanted him dead.

490
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,463
He killed my wife and child.

491
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:18,842
Rupert Ames-
did you murder him as well?

492
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,387
Rupert Ames deserved to die.

493
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:25,515
They both deserved to die.

494
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,269
So you arranged
both of those murders?

495
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,771
Yes, I planned it...

496
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:35,775
in my head, over and over again.
It took me a long time.

497
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:40,780
All right.

498
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,116
I guess we're done here.

499
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,869
Counselor?

500
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,291
You might want to cancel
your 12:30 lunch with Judge Roberts.

501
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,919
Excuse me?

502
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:56,421
In fact, you might want to
cancel the rest of the week,

503
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:59,299
'cause you're gonna be busy.
Sit down.

504
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,678
We're done here.
We have your confession.

505
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,181
Mmm. Oh, you do?

506
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,933
On tape.

507
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,936
See, in our profession,
we consider that a slam-dunk.

508
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,855
Oh, really?
I don't think so. Let's think back.

509
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,690
What did I say?

510
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,860
That I wanted to kill
Clarence Darby?

511
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,363
Yeah, sure.
What father wouldn't?

512
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,157
That both Darby and Ames
deserved to die?

513
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,951
I think most people
would agree with that.

514
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:29,371
That I planned it over and over
again in my head?

515
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,791
Yeah. Who wouldn't
fantasize about that?

516
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,669
None of these are
an admission of guilt, Nick.

517
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,546
- You might want to check the tape.
- We know you did it.

518
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:42,050
Well, it's not what you know,
it's what you can prove in court.

519
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:43,677
Didn't you tell me that once?

520
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,178
The only problem with your theory

521
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,472
is that Darby's body was
found on your property.

522
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,809
One of my many properties-
an old abandoned warehouse, Nick.

523
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,895
Junkies, they trespass there
all the time.

524
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,147
Isn't Darby involved
in the drug trade?

525
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,025
That's an unsavory world.
I bet you a jury would agree.

526
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:02,237
Or perhaps someone was
trying to frame me.

527
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,114
You know, Clyde,

528
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,367
there's a lot of assholes in prison
that thought they were smarter than me.

529
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:10,078
Let's stop fucking around.

530
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:13,206
Nick, unless you have any
hard evidence,

531
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:15,750
then why are we even here?
Why are we having this-

532
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,336
- What do you want?
- -conversation?

533
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,632
Well, that's easy.

534
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,094
Now you're the one who
makes deals with murderers, yeah?

535
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,471
So I've come to make mine.

536
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:33,143
I will give you a confession,
a real confession.

537
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,478
You just have to
give me something in return.

538
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:38,815
Yeah, well, since you
are a murderer, what might that be?

539
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,151
A bed.

540
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,114
But a nice bed.

541
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,700
I want a nice new one
for my cell.

542
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:50,368
Very simple.

543
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,079
You're gonna have to deal with that,
because the one I have is lumpy, Nick.

544
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,290
It's making me crazy.

545
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:58,043
Clyde, I think you've got me
confused with detail people.

546
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,295
See, I don't deal
with prison conditions.

547
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,714
I believe those cots
are bolted into the cells.

548
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:05,967
Well, that's what wrenches are for,
dumbass.

549
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,387
You know, one of those new
Duxiana beds

550
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,891
with the adjustable- you know,
adjustable lumbar support,

551
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,392
- that's the one.
- I've seen the commercial.

552
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,977
- That's the one I want.
- Those are nice.

553
00:39:16,145 --> 00:39:17,979
- 'Cause really-
- Comes on late at night.

554
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,814
- And frankly I don't think-
- Two old people laying on the bed.

555
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,399
- I'll be able to focus
on anything

556
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,735
until I've had a good
revitalizing night's sleep

557
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:26,154
in my therapeutic Duxiana bed.

558
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,031
So that's the deal:

559
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,743
you get me my bed,
you get your confession.

560
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,746
Okay, let me think
about that for a second.

561
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,040
How about...

562
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,000
fuck no.

563
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,012
Hey, what are you doing?

564
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,306
- What do you mean?
- Why did you tell him no?

565
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:56,601
A mattress? He doesn't make
those kinds of decisions.

566
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,938
Take your ego out of it, Nick. Shelton's
got a point: this case is shit.

567
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:02,440
We need a confession.
And a mattress for a murder confession?

568
00:40:02,608 --> 00:40:04,818
- That's a pretty good deal.
- He's playing us, Jonas.

569
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,486
Well, then we will play him.

570
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,238
Nick?

571
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:10,949
There's an urgent call from your office.
They say you're not answering your cell.

572
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:13,952
I need to finish up here and then
I will be home as soon as I can.

573
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,037
Listen to me:
the things on this video-

574
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,832
Nick, I have never seen
anything like it.

575
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:20,333
Please come home.

576
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:24,337
Listen, you need to calm down.
Tell her that it's not real...

577
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,172
- Okay.
- ... and that I love her.

578
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,382
Come home.
Come home soon, please.

579
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,384
- Kelly, did you see his face?
- No.

580
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,636
It was covered with something.
I couldn't see.

581
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,806
Okay, baby, let me finish up here and
I'll come home as fast as I can, okay?

582
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,850
Okay.

583
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:40,103
This motherfucker sent a DVD to my house
of him killing Darby.

584
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,064
- What?
- My daughter saw it.

585
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:46,401
He recorded it?
We've got him.

586
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:50,029
No no, he had on a mask.
We need that confession.

587
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,323
You still want to bargain
with this man?

588
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,701
The art of the possible, Warden.

589
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:56,369
Make the deal.

590
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:02,000
Hey, come on, man! Give us one!

591
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:17,932
Back problems, Warden-
the worst.

592
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,518
You got bigger problems than that.

593
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,271
It's the have-nots in here, son.

594
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:27,108
I don't know that I want
to be the one "have. "

595
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:32,363
Turn around.

596
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:38,036
I don't think he likes me.

597
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:42,415
Nice bed.

598
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,252
Thank you.

599
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,922
It's a single.

600
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,635
I'd watch my fucking back
around here, you hear?

601
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,429
In the cell, let's go.

602
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,143
We can't put
Clyde Shelton anywhere-

603
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,395
not in a job, not in a city,
not even the country.

604
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:07,607
So I dug a little deeper and I found
something from his missing years:

605
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:11,277
a couple of contract payments to Clyde
from the Department of Defense.

606
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:14,113
- And his real estate?
- He bought nine properties

607
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,199
under his own name,
then he transferred them

608
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,534
to some corporation in Panama.

609
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,577
We can't get to the addresses.

610
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:21,162
A lack of reciprocity
is our problem.

611
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,914
So I'm gonna circle
back to the farmhouse.

612
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:26,292
That's a waste of time. He wanted us
to find it and find him there.

613
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,670
It's the industrial stuff
that's curious.

614
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,339
All right, I don't care what you
have to do and who you have to piss off.

615
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:34,008
If we have to invade
Panama again, fine.

616
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,678
Clyde is hiding those properties
for a reason. Find him.

617
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,096
Got it.

618
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,902
- Baby, you leave it cracked?
- Hmm? Yeah, I left it cracked.

619
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,780
- Night light?
- Isn't she too old for a night light?

620
00:42:55,948 --> 00:42:58,199
Yeah, I left a night light.

621
00:42:58,367 --> 00:43:00,243
- Good.
- Look,

622
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,245
I told her that
that video wasn't real.

623
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,664
- Okay.
- It's some sort of horror film-

624
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,332
something she shouldn't
be looking at anyway.

625
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,209
- Okay, good.
- She'll be okay.

626
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,877
Yeah. And you?

627
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:12,964
- Am I what? Okay?
- Yeah.

628
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:15,174
Of course.
Don't I look okay?

629
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,218
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

630
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,764
Nick is always okay.

631
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,559
Always- I'm extra good.

632
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:28,187
I love you.

633
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,772
I love you too.

634
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,114
In light of Mr. Shelton's
economic means

635
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,991
and his potential flight risk,

636
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,578
the egregious nature of both
Mr. Ames's and Mr. Darby's deaths,

637
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:47,582
the state requests that
bail be denied, Your Honor.

638
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,918
Seeing as how you've...

639
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,088
waived your right to
counsel, Mr. Shelton,

640
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,507
do you have anything to say?

641
00:43:56,675 --> 00:43:58,676
Mr. Shelton?

642
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:03,181
Do you have anything
that you'd like to say, Mr. Shelton?

643
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,683
Yes yes yes, Your Honor.

644
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:08,728
- Should I stand?
- Please.

645
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,864
Your Honor, I'm a law-abiding citizen.

646
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,908
I'm just a regular guy.

647
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,869
I am not a flight risk.

648
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:27,622
And this is my first alleged offense.

649
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:32,418
And the prosecution has not presented
one single piece of evidence against me.

650
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,963
Now in these circumstances,

651
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,633
unless the state has obtained
some new piece of information

652
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:41,552
relating to my involvement
in the matter in question,

653
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:45,640
then I find it highly prejudicial,
even constitutionally offensive,

654
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:48,101
to keep me detained without bail.

655
00:44:48,268 --> 00:44:50,353
It's a slippery slope,
Your Honor.

656
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,648
Haven't we seen the result
of such violations,

657
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,234
both internationally and domestically?
Case in point

658
00:44:56,402 --> 00:45:00,697
would be Day v. McDonough,
docket #041325.

659
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:07,453
I am actually inclined
to agree with you, Mr. Shelton.

660
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:11,791
Your Honor, Mr. Shelton has
agreed to give us a full confession.

661
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,919
Has he given it, Mr. Rice?

662
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,546
No, Your Honor.

663
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,382
Well, then in my opinion,

664
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:22,301
the state has failed to establish
a compelling basis

665
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,638
for its motion,
and I will grant bail in the amount of-

666
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,974
Your Honor,
I would caution you not to do that.

667
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,810
Thank you.

668
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,520
Excuse me?

669
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:35,314
No, I don't think I will excuse you.

670
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,358
You see, this is what
I'm talking about.

671
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:40,445
You were about to let me go.
Are you kidding me?

672
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:44,031
This is why we're here
in the first place.

673
00:45:45,117 --> 00:45:47,952
You think I don't remember
who you are, lady?

674
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:50,955
I would tread carefully, Mr. Shelton.

675
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,832
Well, how carefully
should I tread?

676
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,710
Because apparently
I just killed two people,

677
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:59,338
and you were about to let me
walk right out that door!

678
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,883
How misguided are you?

679
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,386
I feed you a couple of
bullshit legal precedents,

680
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,639
and there you go- you jump
on it like a bitch in heat.

681
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,267
- Folks, you all hang out-
- I'm warning you, Mr. Shelton!

682
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,352
- -in the same little club.
- You will be held in contempt!

683
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,730
And every day you let madmen
and murderers back on the street.

684
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,316
- You're too busy treating the law-
- One more time!

685
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,859
- -like it's a fucking assembly line!
- One more time.

686
00:46:20,027 --> 00:46:21,736
- Do you have any idea what justice is?
- You are now-

687
00:46:21,904 --> 00:46:23,821
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- -in contempt of court.

688
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:27,074
- Whatever happened to right and wrong?
- Remove this man.

689
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,702
- Whatever happened to the people?
- Bail denied!

690
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,829
- Whatever happened to justice?
- Bail denied!

691
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,208
And I bet you take it up
the fucking ass, bitch.

692
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,542
Bailiff.

693
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,503
Hey, see you later, Nick.

694
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:41,964
Insanity?

695
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,885
That's what you're building
your defense on? Insanity?

696
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,723
Nick, I told you I would
give you a confession.

697
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,600
And I- I meant it.

698
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:54,852
- I saw a movie today.
- You did?

699
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,855
My daughter saw the same movie.

700
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,900
Well, you taught your daughter
about good versus evil?

701
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,735
I don't have to.

702
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,364
Well, that's what this movie was about:
good conquering evil,

703
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,866
the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

704
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,952
I didn't get that.

705
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,121
I'm gonna give you
one more chance, Clyde.

706
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:17,792
And don't test me
'cause I will run you over.

707
00:47:17,960 --> 00:47:19,877
Fair enough.

708
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,588
You did get me my bed.

709
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,049
A deal's a deal.

710
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,927
That was you on video
killing Clarence Darby, wasn't it?

711
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,846
Yes, that was me.

712
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,643
Okay, fair enough.
That was me, Clyde Shelton,

713
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:37,687
on the video,
killing Clarence Darby.

714
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,939
Not good enough, Clyde.
I need specifics.

715
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:45,945
I took his fingers with bolt cutters,

716
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,321
his toes with tin snips,

717
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,824
his balls with a hacksaw,

718
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:53,286
and his penis with a box cutter.

719
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,162
How's that for specifics?

720
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,623
And Ames?

721
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,419
Switching the canisters was easy.
Everything's automated these days,

722
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,838
so I just hacked into
the shipping company's server

723
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,924
and swapped a few numbers around
so the package came to me.

724
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,302
Then I switched
the potassium chloride

725
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:13,764
with something a little more...
deliberate.

726
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,143
Well, I'm tired of
hearing your bullshit.

727
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,228
I got everything I need.

728
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:21,564
What now?

729
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,482
I go home;
you go to prison.

730
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,068
You know, the righteous prospering,
the wicked suffering.

731
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,487
That ought to make you
feel better about the system.

732
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,947
What if I had another
confession to make?

733
00:48:30,115 --> 00:48:31,824
Call a priest.

734
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,868
But another confession would
mean another deal, Nick,

735
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:37,079
so you would have to
give me something in return.

736
00:48:40,292 --> 00:48:44,295
You ever been to Del Frisco's?
They cater.

737
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:48,299
So for lunch, I would love
a 20oz porterhouse steak,

738
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,927
medium,
maybe a little bit charred,

739
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:55,389
with all the trimmings-
pommes frites, asparagus, butter squash.

740
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:58,100
Fuck you and your pommes frites.

741
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,271
I'll tell you what:
can I have my iPod as well?

742
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:05,274
I'd love a little bit
of music with my meal.

743
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,319
First rule of negotiating, Clyde: you
gotta have something to bargain with.

744
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,989
Would the life of
Bill Reynolds suffice?

745
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:20,498
Open it.

746
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:25,002
Who the fuck is Bill Reynolds?

747
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:26,837
Darby's attorney.

748
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:29,423
Tell me you located him.

749
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:33,177
I've got his wife.
She reported him missing three days ago.

750
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,221
Thank you, Mrs. Reynolds.

751
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,432
Well, looks like I got something
to bargain with after all, Nick.

752
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:42,603
At the moment,
Bill Reynolds is still alive.

753
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,648
I'll tell you exactly where he is.

754
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:49,652
Just bring me my meal and
my music at 1:00 exactly.

755
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,238
00 sharp.

756
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,532
00, Nick.

757
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,423
That's good, right there.

758
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,137
All right, up!

759
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:26,022
- It's 5 to 1:00.
- I don't take orders from him or you.

760
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:28,065
And inmates don't have
access to the time.

761
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:31,152
- We tell them what time it is.
- I don't care if he has a Rolex or not.

762
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,362
We need to stick to the timeline
that was agreed to.

763
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:35,656
Fuck him, Nick.
Let him wait.

764
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,533
Christ, he sawed a guy's dick off.

765
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,869
Whether you like it or not,
we are on his time.

766
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,912
Check it again.

767
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,294
Are you shitting me with this?!

768
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,590
This motherfucker!

769
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,805
Man, come on!
I'm fucking hungry!

770
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,813
Steamed asparagus,

771
00:51:07,981 --> 00:51:10,816
- lobster macaroni and cheese...
- Wow.

772
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,529
...porterhouse steak,
seared, medium rare.

773
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,657
Mmm!

774
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,789
Hmm.

775
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:27,041
- Napkin, Nick.
- Napkin.

776
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:32,338
Oh, excuse me, waiter?

777
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:35,549
You might want to put 30%
down for yourself, my man.

778
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:41,514
- Hey, what time is it?
- It's 1:00.

779
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:44,350
Is that right, Nick?

780
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:48,229
- It's 1:08.
- That's disappointing, Warden.

781
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:50,606
I mean, how can you expect me
not to fuck with you

782
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,316
when you can't even
be honest with me?

783
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,362
Late or not, Clyde, you have what you
asked for. Now where's Reynolds?

784
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,447
Can I have some silverware,
gentlemen?

785
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,032
Silverware.

786
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,493
You get a spork.

787
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,538
Idiot.

788
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,542
Thanks.

789
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,427
Come on, Clyde.

790
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:26,600
Okay.

791
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,520
Here we go:

792
00:52:29,688 --> 00:52:32,815
39N57'...

793
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:34,567
04",

794
00:52:34,734 --> 00:52:38,404
075W10'22".

795
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,197
And you'd better hurry, Nick.

796
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,908
'Cause by anybody's watch but
the warden's, you're already late.

797
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:45,786
- Open the door!
- Where's my lunch?

798
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:54,753
I'll take a ground unit!

799
00:53:16,610 --> 00:53:19,528
So I suppose if I don't
share this with you, you're gonna-

800
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,155
I'm gonna get the fuck up,

801
00:53:21,323 --> 00:53:23,324
I'm gonna cock back
my right hand,

802
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:27,077
and I'm gonna split your whole
fucking skull in two. How about that?

803
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,916
Well, come on over here. Join me.
There's plenty to go around.

804
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:39,882
Here, enjoy.
Have some pasta.

805
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,176
It's good.

806
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:43,969
What about some steak?
You want steak?

807
00:53:44,137 --> 00:53:45,638
- Mmm.
- Here, have some steak.

808
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,932
Here's a big piece for you.

809
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:50,226
There you go.

810
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,397
Good, huh?

811
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:07,493
What'd you do
to get in here, anyways?

812
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,997
I did what I had to do.

813
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,421
So you got a girl or something?

814
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,802
Mmm, it's a long story.

815
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,683
Pilot, how much longer?

816
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,936
Two minutes.

817
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,191
How about you?
You have a girl?

818
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,860
- Got a few girls back home.
- Oh, yeah?

819
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,696
Yeah.

820
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,865
- You have a boyfriend in here or no?
- Get the fuck out of here.

821
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,923
This is- it's Reynolds's.

822
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,427
- Not a good sign, Nick.
- Just dig.

823
00:55:20,442 --> 00:55:22,276
- Jesus Christ!
- Reynolds!

824
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,487
- He's unconscious.
- Reynolds!

825
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,657
He's gone, Nick.
He's gone.

826
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,868
- Oxygen?
- Get something to get him out!

827
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:34,538
He's got IV lines going to his-

828
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,832
He's got him cuffed!

829
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,461
Listen, you got your keys
to the cuffs?

830
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,423
- Mmm!
- Mmm.

831
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,300
Shit.

832
00:55:46,468 --> 00:55:49,136
Oh, God, I'm so happy.

833
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,805
Your lucky day, huh?
Get some food.

834
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:54,850
Here, wanna take a shot at this?

835
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,144
- What is it?
- Know how to use it?

836
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,563
No.

837
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:19,208
Oh, shit! Check this out!

838
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:24,546
He's crazy!

839
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:26,215
Don't stop now, partner!

840
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,218
Finish him, come on!
Take his head off!

841
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,639
Take it off!

842
00:57:03,461 --> 00:57:05,838
I need a shower, Warden.

843
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,214
Get him out of there!

844
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:13,220
Dunnigan,
what time do you have?

845
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:16,765
37.

846
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,725
Took us roughly 15 minutes
to get here.

847
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:19,977
Yeah?

848
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:22,646
Reynolds's air was rigged to
shut off at 1:15.

849
00:57:22,814 --> 00:57:25,566
If Shelton would have got
his lunch on time, he'd still be alive.

850
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,025
Fuck this guy, Nick.

851
00:57:27,193 --> 00:57:30,946
He wants to play games,
we can play games too.

852
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:33,449
We need to take the gloves off.

853
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,325
No.

854
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:42,499
Nick, it's Sarah.
Listen, Clyde murdered his cell-mate.

855
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:46,545
The warden is furious.
He's moving him to solitary.

856
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:48,964
That's all I know right now.

857
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,664
How are we doing?

858
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,751
Great. Can you believe this?

859
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,046
Checking his iPod for clues.

860
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:30,756
I do the same thing
with my daughter's.

861
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,633
Learn anything?

862
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,219
Yeah, they both got
shit taste in music.

863
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,640
We got a game plan
with this guy or what?

864
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,391
Game plan?

865
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,435
I tell you, I got a game plan.

866
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:46,313
Give me five minutes alone with him
and I'll cripple the fucker.

867
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:49,483
I don't give a shit
what happened to his family.

868
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,109
It's no excuse.

869
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,785
Wow.

870
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,585
Stop right there.

871
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,971
Step into the cell.

872
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,644
We found Reynolds.

873
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:10,772
Moments too late,
from what I hear.

874
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,693
I had to call his wife and tell her
that her husband had been buried alive.

875
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:17,696
Justice should be harsh, Nick,

876
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:20,365
but especially for those
who denied it to others.

877
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,118
And your cell-mate?
What was that about?

878
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:29,666
You murdered a man
because your lunch was late.

879
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,668
No.

880
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:36,089
No. No, you murdered him
because you couldn't keep your word.

881
01:00:36,257 --> 01:00:39,343
We made a deal, you and I:
1:00 PM.

882
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,387
That's a pretty important principle
I'd like you start learning, Nick:

883
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,473
- keeping your word.
- Oh, really?

884
01:00:44,641 --> 01:00:47,559
What principle was at work when
you tortured and killed those people?

885
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:51,605
That everyone must be held
accountable for their actions.

886
01:00:57,737 --> 01:01:00,489
You think your wife
and daughter would feel good

887
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,492
about you killing in their name?

888
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:32,771
My wife and daughter
can't feel anything.

889
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,149
They're dead.

890
01:02:12,103 --> 01:02:14,062
Hey, Nick?

891
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,565
On Clyde's real estate,
Judge Stansfield shut us down.

892
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:20,193
He's looking for some sort of legal
precedent that I'm not sure exists.

893
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,403
- But?
- But...

894
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:22,863
I think I may have found
a way around it.

895
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,198
- I'll call in a favor from a friend.
- Who's your friend?

896
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,534
You don't name your friends
or they stop doing you favors.

897
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:29,369
Something else Cantrell said.

898
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:33,540
No, that was all you.
Jonas, hi.

899
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:37,669
She's thinking just like you, Nick.
Guess you trained her well.

900
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,839
- One day she'll have my job.
- Let's get some air.

901
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,219
Clyde's government contract payments
were bothering me,

902
01:02:46,387 --> 01:02:48,972
so I pulled some ancient strings.
We're meeting someone.

903
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:50,599
Who might that be?

904
01:02:50,767 --> 01:02:54,603
Someone who does some really nasty shit
so we can live the American dream.

905
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:08,742
So Clyde finally lost it?

906
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,036
Somebody must have
really pissed him off.

907
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,538
You worked with Shelton,
is that right?

908
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:17,417
Okay, first of all,
I was never here and we never spoke.

909
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,212
Tell us what we're dealing with.
Shelton was a spy or-

910
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,964
Spies are a dime a dozen.
I'm a spy.

911
01:03:23,132 --> 01:03:26,635
Clyde is a brain.
He's a think-tank type guy.

912
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:29,304
His specialty was low-impact
kinetic operations.

913
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,848
Is this a hell of a fancy way
to say that he kills people?

914
01:03:32,016 --> 01:03:33,141
We kill people.

915
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,811
He figured out how to do it
without ever being in the same room.

916
01:03:35,978 --> 01:03:39,314
It was his gift,
and he was the best.

917
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:41,900
One time we're tasking
this tricky target.

918
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,569
I mean, we're using cruise missiles
and predators

919
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:48,532
and we even had a B-2 bomber
flatten this guy's villa with a JDAM.

920
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:50,325
All right? We're burning up
millions in ordnance

921
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:51,827
and we're getting nowhere
with this guy.

922
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,913
So we call Clyde and
we ask him to solve our problem.

923
01:03:55,081 --> 01:03:56,998
Clyde develops a Kevlar thread

924
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,835
with a high-tech ratchet
made of carbon fiber

925
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:01,878
put in a necktie.

926
01:04:02,046 --> 01:04:04,631
Two days later, Mrs. Bad Guy
comes home,

927
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:07,509
finds Mr. Bad Guy dead
on the bathroom tile,

928
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:09,010
choked to death.

929
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,682
What I'm saying is, just assume
that this guy can hear and see

930
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,517
everything that you're doing.

931
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,811
No, we've got him locked away,
maximum security.

932
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:20,981
If he's in jail, it's because
he wants to be in jail.

933
01:04:21,148 --> 01:04:24,818
He's a born tactician. Every move
that he makes, it means something.

934
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,321
That cell-mate that he killed-
you think that was random?

935
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,658
No.

936
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,452
That's a pawn being
moved off the board.

937
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,874
If I were you,
I'd be looking for the next piece.

938
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,710
Anybody who had anything
to do with that case,

939
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,879
he's gonna be coming after you.

940
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:49,092
So what are you saying?
You saying we can't stop him?

941
01:04:51,178 --> 01:04:54,014
Walk into his cell
and put a bullet in his head.

942
01:04:55,892 --> 01:04:58,852
Aside from that?
No, you can't stop him.

943
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,479
If Clyde wants you dead,
you're dead.

944
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,952
- Hello?
- Sarah? Sarah, it's Nick.

945
01:05:16,120 --> 01:05:17,871
Set up a meeting
with Judge Burch.

946
01:05:18,039 --> 01:05:20,040
We need her to help us
keep Clyde on ice.

947
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,834
Help us with what, Nick?
The man's in prison.

948
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,711
He's worse than we thought.

949
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:27,339
- Chester's your boyfriend, right?
- Chester.

950
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,341
Yeah.

951
01:05:29,508 --> 01:05:32,719
Good. Maybe stay a few days
at his place.

952
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,931
And have Dunnigan send
a patrol car to my house.

953
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,849
Sorry about this, Sarah.

954
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:47,317
I can't supersede the penal code.

955
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,944
You've already got him in solitary.

956
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:51,363
A half-decent paralegal will have him
out of there by next week.

957
01:05:51,530 --> 01:05:53,198
We just want to limit his options;

958
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,033
give him less contact,
less access,

959
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:58,495
even if it's just rescinding his
mandatory exercise period for a week.

960
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,789
- Under what cause?
- Whatever cause you want.

961
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:03,166
Wrap it around whatever
piece of legal doctrine

962
01:06:03,334 --> 01:06:06,920
that helps you rationalize it,
Your Honor.

963
01:06:08,714 --> 01:06:09,923
So let me get this straight:

964
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,759
you want me to violate
his God-given civil rights

965
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:15,762
in the name of some murky sense
of the greater good.

966
01:06:15,930 --> 01:06:18,056
Is that the gist of it, gentlemen?

967
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,273
Okay. I'm game.

968
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:32,445
Just don't plan
on it sticking for long, all right?

969
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,659
Wait, you're gonna take that,

970
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:39,911
after all the grief you've
given me over cell phones?

971
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:42,998
That's one of the benefits of
being a judge, Mr. Rice.

972
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:46,209
I can pretty much do
whatever I want.

973
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,005
Hello?

974
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:54,300
Oh my God.

975
01:06:54,468 --> 01:06:57,053
Back out. Back out.

976
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:03,893
... at city hall, though we are
unable to confirm the details,

977
01:07:04,061 --> 01:07:06,187
we do know that
at least one person is dead

978
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,481
in what officials are calling
a possible murder.

979
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:10,900
We have reporters
on the ground...

980
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,318
Up.

981
01:07:17,408 --> 01:07:19,242
Somebody's helping this guy-

982
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,661
a bomb in that phone,
and she doesn't know about it.

983
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:24,789
Who had access?

984
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:26,666
Are you okay?

985
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,502
I've survived the war
and two ex-wives. I'll be fine.

986
01:07:31,505 --> 01:07:33,339
How are you holding up?

987
01:07:33,507 --> 01:07:35,800
I'm good.

988
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,359
So you're killing judges now?

989
01:07:53,527 --> 01:07:57,655
In my experience, Nick, lessons not
learned in blood are soon forgotten.

990
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,450
And vengeance keeps you
warm at night.

991
01:08:00,618 --> 01:08:02,619
Vengeance?

992
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:07,332
That's what you think this is about?
Vengeance?

993
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,167
What else could it be?

994
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:13,588
No, Nick, I had 10 years
for vengeance, if that's what I wanted.

995
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:17,383
You don't think that I watch you
go to work every morning at 8:00 AM?

996
01:08:17,551 --> 01:08:21,471
Or that I watch Kelly take Denise
to school, 8:15?

997
01:08:21,639 --> 01:08:25,391
No, I could have slaughtered you
or your family anytime I wanted!

998
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:28,269
You even think about
touching my family-

999
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,981
you even think about touching
my family...

1000
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:42,617
I do my job.

1001
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:45,161
I'm the best at it.

1002
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,580
- It works.
- You were doing yourjob

1003
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:52,043
the way that best served you, Nick-
the way that best served you.

1004
01:08:52,211 --> 01:08:55,463
- That has to change.
- What do you want, Clyde?

1005
01:08:55,631 --> 01:08:58,174
You at war with the whole world?
It's not gonna bring anybody back.

1006
01:08:58,342 --> 01:09:01,636
No, I'm at war with this-

1007
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,848
this- this broken thing-

1008
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:07,058
this thing that brought
you and I together.

1009
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,644
This broken thing works
for people that are sane.

1010
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,188
You think doing what you're doing
is gonna change anything?

1011
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:14,858
You and whoever else
you have helping you

1012
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:17,026
are gonna pay.

1013
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,822
I don't think you
have any idea

1014
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,533
who's helping me
or what I'm doing.

1015
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:24,826
It's a matter of time.

1016
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:27,245
See, you see the bodies,
you see the smoke,

1017
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,456
but the larger picture
still eludes you.

1018
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:32,709
Do tell.

1019
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:36,921
I would like to...

1020
01:09:37,089 --> 01:09:38,923
but I would rather show you.

1021
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:45,013
I still have faith in you,
so I'm gonna give you one last chance.

1022
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,514
Here's the deal:

1023
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:51,102
release me and drop
all charges by 6:00 AM.

1024
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:54,022
- 6:00 AM, Nick.
- Or what?

1025
01:09:56,734 --> 01:09:59,569
Or I kill everyone.

1026
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:12,665
- Hello?
- Yeah, Sarah,

1027
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:15,835
he has to have an accomplice-
probably somebody inside the prison.

1028
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:19,339
We have to go through all the prisoners'
files to find some sort of connection.

1029
01:10:19,506 --> 01:10:21,216
Do you want the files
brought to the office?

1030
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,594
No, there isn't time. Get everybody
together and bring them to the prison.

1031
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,221
We're moving in.

1032
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,574
Stop looking at your watch.

1033
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:50,453
Anything from your friend?

1034
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,247
This treaty with Panama is a mess.

1035
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:55,375
We can't access anything about
specific property holdings,

1036
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:57,418
but my friend found
this tiny loophole

1037
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,797
that grants us access to
Clyde's corporate expenses.

1038
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,465
Does that help?

1039
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:10,723
So we match sale prices
of industrial properties sold in Philly

1040
01:11:10,891 --> 01:11:13,601
up against purchases made
by his corporation.

1041
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:17,105
Okay, I got it.

1042
01:11:25,823 --> 01:11:28,866
- Hey, Nick, can I ask you something?
- Hmm?

1043
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:33,997
Would you do it
the same way now?

1044
01:11:34,164 --> 01:11:36,666
Would you still cut
a deal for Darby?

1045
01:11:38,502 --> 01:11:42,380
This is the job, Sarah.
We have to make choices.

1046
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:46,384
- But did you make the right choice?
- We made the right choice, right?

1047
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,222
I don't know.

1048
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,808
I'm 35, Nick.

1049
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:55,935
And there are things-
there are possibilities

1050
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:57,854
that I'm not gonna have now.

1051
01:11:59,023 --> 01:12:02,942
And it's okay.
I know it's part of the deal.

1052
01:12:04,778 --> 01:12:07,947
And don't get me wrong.
I love working for you.

1053
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:14,954
But I just want to make sure
I gave up those things

1054
01:12:15,122 --> 01:12:18,541
for more than just
a high conviction rate.

1055
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,229
Do you want any more coffee?

1056
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:41,647
No.

1057
01:13:37,579 --> 01:13:39,831
All right.

1058
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:42,333
All right, let's just get focused here.
This guy's not God.

1059
01:13:42,501 --> 01:13:44,919
He's not the All Powerful.
He's just well-prepared.

1060
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,088
We need to be equally
well-prepared.

1061
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,967
Take a couple of hours, go home,
come back. We'll get a fresh start.

1062
01:13:51,135 --> 01:13:52,510
Okay?

1063
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:06,357
Come on, old man, let's see if
we can find you some breakfast.

1064
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,458
Hey, Nick, get some rest.

1065
01:14:23,625 --> 01:14:27,962
Give Chester my regards.
When do I get to meet him?

1066
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,382
Oh, he's not ready for that.

1067
01:14:32,634 --> 01:14:34,177
'Night, Jonas.

1068
01:14:45,522 --> 01:14:47,773
I don't know how
this one's gonna turn out, Nick.

1069
01:14:47,941 --> 01:14:49,942
We're gonna stop him.
That's how it's gonna turn out.

1070
01:14:51,612 --> 01:15:02,038
Ahh!

1071
01:15:02,206 --> 01:15:04,916
Sarah.

1072
01:15:10,547 --> 01:15:12,006
Sarah.

1073
01:15:45,415 --> 01:15:48,960
In the past 48 hours, six
officials from the Justice Department

1074
01:15:49,127 --> 01:15:52,421
have been killed in a series of vicious
and premeditated attacks.

1075
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:55,258
This marks the first time in
the history of the United States

1076
01:15:55,425 --> 01:15:58,302
where government officials have been,
by all appearances,

1077
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:00,429
systematically murdered.

1078
01:16:00,597 --> 01:16:03,432
We'll continue to follow this story and
bring you up-to-the-minute details...

1079
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:10,439
Nick, I'm sorry to have to do this now,
but we've got something here.

1080
01:16:10,607 --> 01:16:13,317
Found this right outside the wall-

1081
01:16:13,485 --> 01:16:15,278
radio beacon-

1082
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:18,155
sent an arming signal to the car bombs
when they went through the gate.

1083
01:16:18,323 --> 01:16:20,908
Security said they checked
every car before anybody got in them.

1084
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:24,370
They didn't check the gas tanks.
That's where the clever prick put 'em.

1085
01:16:24,538 --> 01:16:26,247
Real precise stuff too.

1086
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:28,332
Could have taken out
a lot more if he wanted to.

1087
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:31,294
- What about Nick's car?
- That's the weird thing.

1088
01:16:31,461 --> 01:16:34,046
It's clean-
hadn't been touched.

1089
01:16:35,299 --> 01:16:37,300
I gotta go.

1090
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,892
Jesus Christ.

1091
01:16:55,402 --> 01:16:57,570
Privacy, please.

1092
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:02,408
So let me get this straight:

1093
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:05,494
not only do we
know who did it,

1094
01:17:05,662 --> 01:17:09,749
we have him locked up
and he's still killing people?

1095
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:15,296
You boys sure
fucked this one up.

1096
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:19,550
The press is gonna kill us.

1097
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,344
Can someone explain this to me?

1098
01:17:21,511 --> 01:17:23,220
We can't yet.

1099
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:31,812
How did this get away
from you, Jonas?

1100
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:34,190
It's complicated, April.

1101
01:17:34,358 --> 01:17:36,776
He's very smart.
He's very angry.

1102
01:17:36,943 --> 01:17:39,570
We assume he has an accomplice
helping him on the outside.

1103
01:17:39,738 --> 01:17:43,366
I'm not having
this conversation.

1104
01:17:43,533 --> 01:17:47,078
I don't care how smart he is
or who's helping him.

1105
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:56,337
We'll release a statement saying we
have suspects, we're following leads-

1106
01:17:56,505 --> 01:17:59,382
- nothing alarming.
- Mayor, you have my word,

1107
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:03,636
we are gonna stop this guy.
He's not gonna hurt anybody else.

1108
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:11,018
I'm assigning security to
each of you from now on.

1109
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,817
Get this situation
under control, gentlemen.

1110
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,252
Dad?

1111
01:18:36,420 --> 01:18:38,754
I bet you don't remember
when I did that.

1112
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:41,340
I bet you I do.

1113
01:18:56,356 --> 01:18:58,149
What?

1114
01:18:58,316 --> 01:19:00,025
Nothing.

1115
01:19:00,193 --> 01:19:03,487
You and your mother are going away
on a little vacation, that's all.

1116
01:19:03,655 --> 01:19:05,239
- You like vacations, right?
- Yeah.

1117
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:07,283
Good.

1118
01:19:07,451 --> 01:19:09,160
But why?

1119
01:19:09,327 --> 01:19:11,495
Why not now?

1120
01:19:11,663 --> 01:19:13,831
Okay.

1121
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,834
Don't need an excuse, right?

1122
01:19:20,380 --> 01:19:21,672
All right.

1123
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,801
No phone calls, no credit cards,
no computers- just cash.

1124
01:19:25,969 --> 01:19:27,553
Daddy, are you coming?

1125
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,598
Oh, yeah, of course.

1126
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:33,100
- Of course I am.
- You'd better, Nick.

1127
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,566
It was first grade, hmm?

1128
01:19:40,734 --> 01:19:42,902
Your mother helped you
with the spelling.

1129
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,237
It was my birthday.

1130
01:19:45,405 --> 01:19:48,199
- We need to go!
- Let's go.

1131
01:19:48,366 --> 01:19:50,034
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye.

1132
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,536
- Love you, Daddy.
- Love you too.

1133
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:59,960
- Nick, your phone lines are clear.
- Good.

1134
01:20:00,128 --> 01:20:03,172
No bugs; nothing's been tampered with.
You're good.

1135
01:21:51,448 --> 01:21:53,616
You should have taken my deal.

1136
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:02,583
That's six fucking innocent people.
Is that how you want to play it? Huh?

1137
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:05,669
It's okay.
It's okay, Nick. I know you're angry.

1138
01:22:05,837 --> 01:22:08,589
That's good. That's what it takes.
That's how it has to be.

1139
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,424
What if I said you was right
and I was wrong?

1140
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:13,385
What if I had said, "Well,
let's take them to trial"? Huh?

1141
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:15,179
Then I would say
you're making progress.

1142
01:22:15,347 --> 01:22:18,557
And we might have lost!
And Ames and Darby would both go free.

1143
01:22:18,725 --> 01:22:21,185
Don't you get that?

1144
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:22,603
Fuck.

1145
01:22:22,771 --> 01:22:24,980
You didn't care, Nick.
You didn't even try.

1146
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:27,858
You could have walked out of
that courtroom with your head held high.

1147
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:29,777
I could have lived with that, Nick.

1148
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:31,737
I keep my head up.

1149
01:22:31,905 --> 01:22:35,699
And you will end this.

1150
01:22:37,494 --> 01:22:39,620
I'm just getting warmed up.

1151
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,539
This is Von Clausewitz shit-
total fucking war.

1152
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:44,625
You fuck.

1153
01:22:49,923 --> 01:22:51,340
No.

1154
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:03,602
I'm gonna pull
the whole thing down.

1155
01:23:03,770 --> 01:23:06,730
I'm gonna bring the whole
fucking diseased, corrupt temple

1156
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:09,358
down on your head.

1157
01:23:09,526 --> 01:23:12,111
It's gonna be Biblical.

1158
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:32,631
Jesus, Nick, she was a good kid.

1159
01:23:33,633 --> 01:23:36,010
Did we bring this all on ourselves?

1160
01:23:38,388 --> 01:23:40,723
Absolutely not.

1161
01:23:42,934 --> 01:23:45,436
You don't actually believe that,
do you?

1162
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,735
Gentlemen? Sorry,
but we need to get going

1163
01:23:52,902 --> 01:23:55,320
if we're going to make it
to the press conference.

1164
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:07,207
I want to read you something
from my speech before we go.

1165
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,379
"We must not give in
to the fear.

1166
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,299
We must face
those things we fear the most.

1167
01:24:15,467 --> 01:24:17,801
We must appeal
to our better angels. "

1168
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:19,928
Too much?

1169
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,014
I'm sorry.

1170
01:24:22,182 --> 01:24:25,768
It's just before, when you asked
if we brought this on ourselves-

1171
01:24:25,935 --> 01:24:28,020
we didn't.

1172
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:29,772
I did.

1173
01:24:31,733 --> 01:24:35,944
When I was young,
I really wanted to change the system.

1174
01:24:36,112 --> 01:24:40,783
You know, I was ready to fight.
I was gonna be the best no matter what.

1175
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,160
You give an inch here,
you give an inch there,

1176
01:24:43,328 --> 01:24:45,996
you get caught up
in the game.

1177
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:49,666
And then you realize that the system
that you're trying to change-

1178
01:24:49,834 --> 01:24:52,336
it changed you.

1179
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,421
Jonas, I've lost my way
somewhere.

1180
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:57,091
Look, remember what I told you?

1181
01:24:57,258 --> 01:25:00,928
The hard part isn't
making the decision.

1182
01:25:01,096 --> 01:25:05,015
It's living with it.

1183
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:11,396
Everybody stay sharp.

1184
01:25:11,564 --> 01:25:13,148
We're on the move.

1185
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:35,939
- We all right?
- It's dead.

1186
01:26:36,107 --> 01:26:37,941
Electrical system's fried.

1187
01:26:38,109 --> 01:26:40,360
What's going on back there?

1188
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,574
Dunnigan, tell them to
get Jonas away from here.

1189
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,251
What the fuck is that?

1190
01:26:58,630 --> 01:26:59,880
Get down, get down!

1191
01:27:24,155 --> 01:27:26,573
Jonas! Jonas!

1192
01:27:27,575 --> 01:27:29,201
- Jonas! Jonas!
- No, Nick! Get back!

1193
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:32,996
Jonas! Get your hands off me!

1194
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:35,832
Jonas! Get out of the car!
Jonas!

1195
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,085
Get out of the car! Get off of me!

1196
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,670
Please listen to me!

1197
01:27:46,719 --> 01:27:48,262
Jonas!

1198
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,222
Jonas.

1199
01:28:10,743 --> 01:28:13,578
I told you to handle this.

1200
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:15,747
You didn't.

1201
01:28:15,915 --> 01:28:17,416
Now we have a jailed psychopath

1202
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:21,003
that's managed to bring this
entire city to its knees.

1203
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24,881
One of my friends
was just murdered.

1204
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:29,636
More than one of my friends
is gone, Mayor.

1205
01:28:29,804 --> 01:28:32,556
What I should do is fire you.

1206
01:28:32,724 --> 01:28:35,183
Hmm?
Right now.

1207
01:28:36,269 --> 01:28:39,062
I resign.

1208
01:28:39,230 --> 01:28:43,275
- Is that your real answer?
- I think that's best.

1209
01:28:48,197 --> 01:28:49,781
No.

1210
01:28:50,825 --> 01:28:53,118
I'm not gonna allow that to happen.
Bring me the Bible.

1211
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:57,706
I'm not gonna let some criminal decide
whether Philadelphia has a DA or not.

1212
01:28:57,874 --> 01:29:00,292
As of now, you're acting
District Attorney.

1213
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:03,462
We'll have a formal
swearing in later.

1214
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:06,840
For now this will suffice.
Stand up.

1215
01:29:08,551 --> 01:29:11,011
Put your left hand on the Bible.
Raise your right hand.

1216
01:29:11,179 --> 01:29:13,013
Repeat after me.

1217
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:15,140
- I, Nicolas Rice...
- I, Nicolas Rice...

1218
01:29:15,308 --> 01:29:17,351
- ... do solemnly swear...
- ... do solemnly swear...

1219
01:29:17,518 --> 01:29:19,311
- ... that I will support...
- ... that I will support...

1220
01:29:19,479 --> 01:29:20,562
- ... obey...
- ... obey...

1221
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:23,398
...and defend the Constitution
of the United States...

1222
01:29:23,566 --> 01:29:25,442
...and defend the
Constitution of the United States...

1223
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:28,570
...and the Constitution of
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania...

1224
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:40,374
People aren't going to work;
kids aren't going to school.

1225
01:29:40,541 --> 01:29:43,001
They're scared,
and I don't blame them.

1226
01:29:43,169 --> 01:29:47,381
So I'm implementing the emergency
provision of the Philadelphia code.

1227
01:29:47,548 --> 01:29:48,840
We're gonna lock this city down.

1228
01:29:49,008 --> 01:29:52,177
Starting now, no one moves
in this city unrestricted.

1229
01:29:52,637 --> 01:29:54,971
I want a show of force
for the public-

1230
01:29:55,139 --> 01:29:57,724
uniforms, detectives,
12-hour shifts.

1231
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,768
Put an armed cop on every corner.

1232
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,562
If you have to give shotguns
to the meter maids, do it.

1233
01:30:02,730 --> 01:30:04,815
There should be no doubt
in people's minds

1234
01:30:04,982 --> 01:30:08,276
that this city is secure
and under our control.

1235
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,989
Okay.

1236
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:22,207
Okay, Clyde.
I get it.

1237
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,005
Listen, that contraption
that killed Cantrell,

1238
01:30:29,173 --> 01:30:32,426
it was a weaponized
bomb-disposal robot.

1239
01:30:32,593 --> 01:30:33,635
Can you believe that?

1240
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:36,721
Damn thing had video, night vision-
you name it.

1241
01:30:36,889 --> 01:30:40,016
It's like military APl,
for Christ's sakes.

1242
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:43,061
That's anti-tank rounds, Nick.

1243
01:30:43,229 --> 01:30:45,147
I think he's saving you for last.

1244
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:50,193
Nick, I'm serious.

1245
01:30:51,863 --> 01:30:54,781
I appreciate the insight.

1246
01:30:58,453 --> 01:31:01,872
Nick, you gotta get in front of
this guy if you want to stay alive.

1247
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,751
I may have a way-

1248
01:31:06,919 --> 01:31:10,505
something a friend
is helping me out with.

1249
01:31:10,673 --> 01:31:12,048
Who's your friend?

1250
01:31:12,216 --> 01:31:14,843
A friend named Chester.
I'll call you back.

1251
01:31:16,637 --> 01:31:18,889
Thank you, Sarah.

1252
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:29,024
This is Nick.
Give me the real-estate listing

1253
01:31:29,192 --> 01:31:32,611
of every industrial property sold
here in the last 10 years.

1254
01:31:58,137 --> 01:32:00,555
Motherfucker.

1255
01:32:18,908 --> 01:32:20,700
You're kidding me, right?

1256
01:32:21,702 --> 01:32:24,120
You're saying Clyde
owns this place?

1257
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:27,207
Something about it
sticks out, right?

1258
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:29,292
Yeah.

1259
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:35,632
What- are you gonna do
what I think you're gonna do?

1260
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,387
- What about his civil rights?
- Fuck his civil rights.

1261
01:32:42,306 --> 01:32:45,225
Yes!

1262
01:33:30,187 --> 01:33:32,606
There's got to be
something in here.

1263
01:33:32,773 --> 01:33:34,482
Yeah.

1264
01:33:50,207 --> 01:33:52,834
Remember this from
outside the house?

1265
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,343
Yeah.

1266
01:34:01,510 --> 01:34:03,386
Get that right there.

1267
01:34:19,987 --> 01:34:22,697
Un-fucking-believable.

1268
01:34:36,379 --> 01:34:38,630
Look at this.

1269
01:34:43,928 --> 01:34:45,804
Watch your step.

1270
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:53,770
This guy tunneled into prison?

1271
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:23,758
Oh, shit.

1272
01:35:28,681 --> 01:35:30,682
Fuck- Semtex.

1273
01:35:34,937 --> 01:35:38,565
Got police uniforms,
other disguises.

1274
01:36:02,173 --> 01:36:04,215
He tunneled into every cell.

1275
01:36:05,217 --> 01:36:06,926
Over here.

1276
01:36:13,267 --> 01:36:15,810
He wanted to be
transferred to solitary.

1277
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:18,688
Surprise, motherfucker.

1278
01:37:01,607 --> 01:37:04,734
- He's not here!
- If he's not there, then where is he?

1279
01:37:10,449 --> 01:37:12,075
Nomos, what happened to your eye?

1280
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:13,743
Oh, long story.

1281
01:37:13,911 --> 01:37:16,871
Stop right there, sir.

1282
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:19,165
Let me see your ID, please.

1283
01:37:19,333 --> 01:37:21,376
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

1284
01:37:21,544 --> 01:37:24,087
Turn around, sir.
Extend your arms.

1285
01:37:25,798 --> 01:37:27,423
Something going on tonight?

1286
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:31,010
- The mayor.
- Mmm, mayor.

1287
01:37:38,519 --> 01:37:40,520
Look at this.

1288
01:37:40,688 --> 01:37:43,147
He tapped into the prison cameras.

1289
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:45,400
Jesus, he's got
cameras everywhere.

1290
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:47,318
- Shit.
- Is that your house?

1291
01:37:47,486 --> 01:37:50,321
Yes.

1292
01:37:51,323 --> 01:37:53,783
Baby, please tell me you're okay.

1293
01:37:53,951 --> 01:37:55,410
Denise- where is she?

1294
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:57,287
Is she with you?
Are you sure?

1295
01:37:57,454 --> 01:37:59,205
Okay.

1296
01:37:59,373 --> 01:38:01,833
Stay where you are.
I'll explain later.

1297
01:38:02,001 --> 01:38:03,835
I love you.

1298
01:38:13,846 --> 01:38:16,055
Von Clausewitz.

1299
01:38:20,561 --> 01:38:22,103
Look at that.

1300
01:38:29,486 --> 01:38:31,279
He's at City Hall.

1301
01:38:32,781 --> 01:38:34,824
You're free to go, sir.

1302
01:38:34,992 --> 01:38:37,994
- Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.
- No, don't worry about it.

1303
01:38:39,413 --> 01:38:42,040
Better to be safe
than sorry, right?

1304
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:45,543
Get ready to evacuate the building.

1305
01:38:45,711 --> 01:38:47,712
We'll need a tactical unit
and a bomb squad.

1306
01:38:47,880 --> 01:38:49,130
Bad idea.
Have them come in soft.

1307
01:38:49,298 --> 01:38:51,966
If Shelton spots them or
any of us, we're fucked.

1308
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:18,034
Hey.

1309
01:39:20,579 --> 01:39:22,205
- Where's the tactical team?
- En route.

1310
01:39:22,373 --> 01:39:24,582
- They're coming in soft- no sirens.
- Bomb squad?

1311
01:39:24,750 --> 01:39:26,292
You're looking at it.

1312
01:39:26,460 --> 01:39:29,754
Right, okay. We take the north surge;
you take the west.

1313
01:39:29,922 --> 01:39:31,339
We'll call.

1314
01:39:36,387 --> 01:39:37,971
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa.
- IDs, please.

1315
01:39:38,138 --> 01:39:40,556
- He's the fucking DA.
- Good for him. IDs, please.

1316
01:39:40,724 --> 01:39:42,725
What's going on here tonight?

1317
01:39:42,893 --> 01:39:45,103
- Security meeting with all the brass.
- What floor?

1318
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:47,188
6th floor- caucus room.

1319
01:39:50,109 --> 01:39:53,861
- What floor is this?
- That's the 5th floor, sir.

1320
01:39:54,029 --> 01:39:56,072
Directly below the caucus room.

1321
01:39:56,240 --> 01:39:59,993
You catch this motherfucker red-handed,
we gotta take him alive.

1322
01:40:22,099 --> 01:40:23,933
Where is he?

1323
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:26,686
What the fuck are we looking for?

1324
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,938
Wait wait wait.

1325
01:40:29,106 --> 01:40:30,314
Right there.

1326
01:40:30,482 --> 01:40:33,192
Stand back.
Don't touch anything.

1327
01:40:34,486 --> 01:40:37,238
It wasn't exactly my first instinct.

1328
01:41:16,236 --> 01:41:18,237
Can I see your ID, please?

1329
01:41:25,287 --> 01:41:27,663
All right, next car, pull forward!

1330
01:42:02,199 --> 01:42:05,743
Malglinite.

1331
01:42:05,911 --> 01:42:08,412
That's napalm, basically.
This shit'll take out the entire floor

1332
01:42:08,580 --> 01:42:10,414
and the one above us.

1333
01:42:10,582 --> 01:42:14,585
Looks like it's- looks like it's
triggered by this cell phone here.

1334
01:42:14,753 --> 01:42:18,881
What?
So an incoming call arms it?

1335
01:42:19,049 --> 01:42:23,010
Yeah. Maybe 30 seconds
till boom time.

1336
01:42:24,012 --> 01:42:26,305
- Jesus.
- Dunnigan, what are you doing?

1337
01:42:26,473 --> 01:42:28,141
- I'm calling the mayor's security.
- We can't.

1338
01:42:28,308 --> 01:42:31,686
Clyde is watching. He sees him evacuate
and he will detonate this thing.

1339
01:42:31,854 --> 01:42:34,480
We don't tell the mayor anything.

1340
01:42:37,067 --> 01:42:39,235
So what do we do?

1341
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,247
Wait a second.

1342
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,291
We've got something.

1343
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:55,293
He's pulling up.

1344
01:43:17,441 --> 01:43:19,483
Mayor April Henry.

1345
01:43:29,077 --> 01:43:31,746
Thank you for coming in
on short notice.

1346
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:39,921
I have one simple question.

1347
01:43:42,382 --> 01:43:45,384
Why is Clyde Shelton still in my city?

1348
01:43:47,346 --> 01:43:49,472
Now I refuse to believe

1349
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:54,060
that one man is smarter
than Homeland Security,

1350
01:43:54,228 --> 01:43:58,648
the FBl, the sheriff's department,
or Philly PD.

1351
01:43:58,815 --> 01:44:01,067
I don't care how we do it,
or what kind

1352
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:04,487
of obscure legal justification
we have to invoke, gentlemen.

1353
01:44:04,655 --> 01:44:07,698
I don't care what laws
we have to bend.

1354
01:44:07,866 --> 01:44:11,786
I am sure that there is a provision
of the Homeland Security Act

1355
01:44:11,954 --> 01:44:14,538
that we can activate.

1356
01:44:14,706 --> 01:44:17,833
Just get him out of here
by tomorrow.

1357
01:44:24,549 --> 01:44:26,050
Clyde?

1358
01:44:30,430 --> 01:44:32,682
Nick.

1359
01:44:32,849 --> 01:44:34,767
I wasn't expecting company.

1360
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:41,315
Yeah, I would have-
I would have cleaned up a little.

1361
01:44:41,483 --> 01:44:44,277
Never seen anybody
tunnel into prison before.

1362
01:44:50,075 --> 01:44:54,036
And the solitary confinement?
That was clever.

1363
01:44:54,204 --> 01:44:56,539
Well, that's how winners play.

1364
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:59,875
We convince the other guy
he's making all the right moves.

1365
01:45:00,877 --> 01:45:03,379
So did you ever catch my accomplice?

1366
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:05,214
Yeah, I did.

1367
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:07,758
It's the end of the road
for you now.

1368
01:45:12,180 --> 01:45:14,765
You played us, Clyde.
You played us real good.

1369
01:45:14,933 --> 01:45:16,809
Thank you.

1370
01:45:16,977 --> 01:45:20,021
You know, I'm glad you finally
get to appreciate

1371
01:45:20,188 --> 01:45:22,106
some of the effort that
I put into all of this.

1372
01:45:22,274 --> 01:45:24,525
Well, you set out to
make a point, Clyde.

1373
01:45:24,693 --> 01:45:25,776
You made it.

1374
01:45:25,944 --> 01:45:27,653
No, people still don't get it.

1375
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:31,574
They don't appreciate what I'm trying
to say, Nick, but they will soon enough.

1376
01:45:31,742 --> 01:45:33,617
A man I cared about
once told me

1377
01:45:33,785 --> 01:45:35,953
that we can't retract
the decisions that we've made,

1378
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:38,664
we can only affect the decisions
we're going to make from here.

1379
01:45:38,832 --> 01:45:41,625
- Are you trying to save me now, Nick?
- I'm giving you a way out.

1380
01:45:41,793 --> 01:45:43,419
Big difference.

1381
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:45,671
Stand up for those principles
you've been preaching.

1382
01:45:45,839 --> 01:45:49,425
See, we're all held accountable, Clyde.
That includes you.

1383
01:45:49,593 --> 01:45:51,260
Why don't we do
the right thing here?

1384
01:45:52,262 --> 01:45:54,764
I'm doing the right thing, Nick.

1385
01:45:56,767 --> 01:45:58,434
You just have to see it that way.

1386
01:45:58,602 --> 01:45:59,977
By murdering all those people,

1387
01:46:00,145 --> 01:46:02,980
all you're doing is
destroying the memory of your daughter

1388
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:06,692
and causing the same pain
that you're suffering from.

1389
01:46:13,408 --> 01:46:17,828
So what do you suggest, Nick?
Make another deal?

1390
01:46:17,996 --> 01:46:21,082
One final offer?
Is that what it is?

1391
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:27,713
I don't make deals with
murderers anymore, Clyde.

1392
01:46:27,881 --> 01:46:29,882
You taught me that.

1393
01:46:34,429 --> 01:46:38,140
Finally.

1394
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,895
Well done. Bravo.

1395
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:46,023
Maybe I wasn't such
a bad teacher after all.

1396
01:46:46,191 --> 01:46:48,401
If you go through with this, Clyde,
it's a decision

1397
01:46:48,568 --> 01:46:51,153
you'll have to live with
for the rest of your life.

1398
01:47:15,011 --> 01:47:16,887
I'm sorry, Nick.

1399
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:21,475
Me too.

1400
01:47:31,653 --> 01:47:33,529
Like I said, Clyde,

1401
01:47:33,697 --> 01:47:36,657
it's a decision you'll have to
live with for the rest of your life,

1402
01:47:36,825 --> 01:47:40,161
which I figure by now
is about 25 more seconds.
