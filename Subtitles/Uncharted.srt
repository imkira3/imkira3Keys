3
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:05,457
Father.

4
00:37:07,127 --> 00:37:09,229
You said we were going to
discuss this.

5
00:37:10,831 --> 00:37:12,032
I changed my mind.

6
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:14,201
I'm allowed.

7
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:19,505
It's not yours to give.

8
00:37:19,639 --> 00:37:23,210
You built none of it - they did.

9
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:25,212
Our fortune is dipped in blood.

10
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:29,582
And giving it all away
will release that stain?

11
00:37:32,052 --> 00:37:36,422
I should have cut you off
years ago.

12
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:21,321
Do you come here to
ruin the one place I find peace?

13
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,690
Father,

14
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:26,693
you can't
give it away.

15
00:40:27,827 --> 00:40:30,230
Tell me it's not too late.

16
00:40:30,363 --> 00:40:32,899
You can't change my mind.

17
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,369
I'm making the arrangements.

18
00:40:38,304 --> 00:40:41,241
This scavenger hunt is over.

19
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,348
<i>Padre.</i>

20
00:40:49,716 --> 00:40:52,252
Do you really
have no faith in me?

21
00:40:54,387 --> 00:40:56,723
In Him I have faith.

22
00:41:12,505 --> 00:41:13,807
Who the hell are you?

23
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,974
Get out of my car!

24
00:41:17,844 --> 00:41:19,779
Santiago, what are you doing?

25
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:23,883
Forgive me,

26
00:41:24,017 --> 00:41:25,218
Father.
