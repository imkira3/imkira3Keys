miss them.

162
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,745
Hey, Leafmen!

163
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:49,047
Huh? What?

164
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:22,380
Queen Tara,
we need to discuss
today's ceremony.

165
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:24,416

crossed our border again.

You're not getting
enough sunshine.

167
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,055
Yes, it's Ronin.

168
00:11:30,057 --> 00:11:32,057
Well, I think he looks
silly kneeling, too,

169
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,892
but I can't get him
to stop doing it.

170
00:11:33,894 --> 00:11:35,860
I think the Boggans
are scouting our defenses.

171
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:39,197
You know they'd do
anything to stop you
from choosing an heir.

172
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,099
But don't worry,
I've got a plan.

173
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:43,601
When we were kids
he wasn't so serious.

174
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:45,637
Would you like
to hear my plan?

175
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,806
And he had
the sweetest smile.

176
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,374
Look, instead of
a public ceremony,

177
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,742
I go in with
a small platoon...

178
00:11:50,744 --> 00:11:52,377
pretend we're
stopping for a drink.

179
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,478
We grab a pod,
bring it back to you.

180
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,083
It blooms, the life of
the forest continues.
We're in, we're out.

181
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,118
(LAUGHING)
It doesn't work
that way.

182
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,787
I can't choose
unless I'm there.

183
00:12:02,789 --> 00:12:05,056
It's about the feeling.

184
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,158
I get it
from the pods...

185
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,394
I get it
from the forest...

186

I get it
from all of us.

187

There we are.

188
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:17,235
Don't you have
feelings, Ronin?

189
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,604
Yes, I feel this is
a bad idea.

190
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,607
The Boggans have never
been this aggressive.

191
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:25,543
I'm not completely
helpless, you know.

192

193

But you're

194

Looking after you
is my duty.

195
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:34,753
Is that the only
reason you do it?

196
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:36,221
Isn't that
reason enough?

197

reason there is.

I can choose an heir.

204

much of the forest
we destroy...

with one wave of her hand.

you just can't stop the rot.

without an heir...

regrow anything.

It's the same reason
we can't hear them.

318
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:50,628
They just move too fast,
like insects.
(FLY BUZZING)

319
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,865
Didn't you ever wonder
why it was so
hard to swat a fly?

320
00:18:53,867 --> 00:18:57,168
My theory is they're
actually living faster.

321
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:00,104
Like in
a different dimension.

322
00:19:00,239 --> 00:19:02,306
So, no matter how fast
we think we are...

323
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:04,575
to them we're just
big and dumb and...

324
00:19:04,577 --> 00:19:07,211
(SLOWLY)
slow.

(FLY CONTINUES BUZZING)

326
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:10,047
Have you ever seen one?

327
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:10,948
Well, you know, uh...

328
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,751
You know what?
Just because you haven't
seen something...

329
00:19:13,753 --> 00:19:15,186
doesn't mean
it's not there.

330
00:19:15,188 --> 00:19:17,688
I, you know, that's...

331
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,023
Come on.

332
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,291
(GROWLS)

333
00:19:20,293 --> 00:19:21,826
Okay, we need to talk.

334
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:23,828
I know it's a lot
to take in.

335
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,630
I mean about us.

336
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,665
Oh, no! No,
we'll do it together!

337
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:31,802
Yeah, both of us.
Here, I made this
for you.

338
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,438
Dad, look...

339
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,507
I am almost old enough
to be on my own anyway...

340
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,745
so I think it would
be better if I just...

341
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:41,212
Um...

342
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:44,348
You don't want
to live here?
That's what you want?

343
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,350
No, it's not
what I want.

344
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,819
I want you to stop!
All this!

345
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:53,491
And be normal. I just,
I want a dad who's not--

Oh, um, okay.
This is big.

348
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,698
This is a big thing
going on right now.
Let me just find--

349
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,432
Where are you going?

350
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,967
I'm just going to
investigate, rather--

351
00:20:02,969 --> 00:20:06,037
Okay, something
must be happening.
(MONITORS BEEPING)

Ooh! Uh... Let's see.
Where's my camera?

353
00:20:08,775 --> 00:20:09,340
Are you serious?

354
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:11,509
You have to
catch these things
in the moment...

355
00:20:11,511 --> 00:20:12,210
while they're happening...

356
00:20:12,212 --> 00:20:14,779
otherwise you miss
a chance that could be
gone forever.

357
00:20:14,781 --> 00:20:18,216
You're missing
a chance right now!
Are you even listening?

358
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:20,284
Look, you've got
to believe me.
I am so close.

359
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,853
All I need is one
little breakthrough.
This could be it!

360
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,524
I will clear this
all up when I get back!

361
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,392
I promise!

362
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,194
Sure, Dad.

363
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:31,596
I'll be here.

364
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,665
In reality.

It's not you.

Uh, Larry? I need
that getaway cab.

Ugh! No bars! (GASPS)
(OZZY BARKING)

Stop! Play dead!

Isn't she pretty?

00:22:06,926 --> 00:22:08,426
She's awesome!

379
00:22:08,428 --> 00:22:11,896
She moved those trees
with her mind!

380
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:14,665
Mom, can I be queen
when I grow up?

381
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:18,235
Oh, honey, it doesn't
work that way.

382
00:22:18,237 --> 00:22:22,973
Today, Queen Tara
gives her power to
a special Pod...

383
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:26,210
so the life of
the forest will continue.

very mysterious, and--

Sweetie,
what are you doing?
(GRUNTING)

386

(GASPS) Mom!
I did it!

387
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,854
Did what?

388
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:38,089
Aw!

389
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:40,825
She's coming!

390
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,093
Don't do anything
to embarrass me...

391
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,295
or it could ruin
my chances of being
a Leafman.

392
00:22:44,297 --> 00:22:45,930
Why do you want
to be a Leafman?

393
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:47,198
They gotta
wear uniforms.

394
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,402
Me? I like to let
it all hang free.

you see that?

396

Yeah, don't do that.
That's vile.

Gentlemen.

Hey. Your Majesty.
Hello.

401
00:23:04,951 --> 00:23:07,718
It's all right.
Relax, it's just me.

402
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,389
Mub, Grub, it's
a very nice-looking
group of Pods.

403
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:15,259
I might have
a hard time picking one.
Do you have a favorite?

404
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:18,562
Well, Your Majesty,
we have had quite
the debate.

405
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:19,897
Really gone
back and forth.

406
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,298
You'll note
the carefully curated

407
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,534
selection of sizes,
densities, color.

408
00:23:23,536 --> 00:23:26,504
With so many variables,
you can't be too hasty.

409
00:23:26,506 --> 00:23:28,339
Boom! Right here.

Hmm.

412
00:23:31,577 --> 00:23:34,478
Well, that's
one way to go.

413
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,548
How about that one?

414
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,584
What? That one?

415
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:42,186
For real?
But it's so--

416
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,888
Perfect!
It's perfect.

417
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,257
Excellent choice,
Your Majesty.

418

isn't the best one.

You need a doctor.
