Is in direct proportion
to the product of their masses

of the distance between them.

It's a shame they're

504
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,926
The moment you stop
applying energy,

505
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,828
It returns to
a quasiplasmoid state.

506
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:45,162
Isn't it remarkable,
sara?

507
00:22:45,230 --> 00:22:47,898
What's remarkable, philip,

508
00:22:47,966 --> 00:22:49,600
Is that I ever
fell in love with you.

509
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,802
You broke my heart...

510
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,106
So that you could stay home
and make some green goo.

511

Sara, it's much more
than that.

Flubber could save
this college.

The flubber is placed
in my back pocket.

517
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,354
When I exit this window,

518
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,756
I will fall
to the ground.

When I hit the ground,

The flubber will send me

At least,
that's what I was told.

The only reason I
loaned this jerkneck

If I press down
on the accelerator,

631
00:29:57,162 --> 00:29:58,695
It releases
the gamma rays

632

And that increases
the thrust.

to that baby chirp.

00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,742
It'll steer right.

639

Ah.
It turns right.

640
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:15,145
If we go left,
it steers left.

So it functions a lot
like a normal

We'll fly over

00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:13,904
Now, get in here.

672
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:16,206
No.

673
00:31:16,274 --> 00:31:17,207
Now.

674
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:18,876
All right.

675
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:20,477
Whoa.

676
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,313
We're fine now.
Heh heh.

677
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,115
Ah...Out
into the world.

678
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,116
Ok, here we go.

679
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:27,184
Look at this!

680
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:30,254
Let's see what
this baby will do.

681
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:34,958
Oh...It works!

682
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:35,859
Yes, it does.

683
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:36,960
I'm flying.

684
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,328
Oh, boy.

685
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:42,032
You know what this means,
weebo?

686
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,133
What?

687
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,637
I'll never have to
buy tires again.
Ha ha...

688
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,971
See what's
on the radio, weebo.

689
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,239

[singing along]

694
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:07,190
Right turn.

695
00:32:08,626 --> 00:32:10,627
Whoa. Yes!

696
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:12,195
Huh?

697
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,636
We're fine.

698
00:32:22,573 --> 00:32:24,174
Whoa!

699
00:32:24,242 --> 00:32:26,343
It's all right.
I saw it.

700
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:28,879
Ha ha.
I don't think so.

701
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,614
Weebo. There's nothing
to worry about--

702
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,715
Aah!

703
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,420
Ohhh...Mayday!

704
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,291
Come on, easy...

705
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,729
Oh...Sorry.

I'm very sorry.

Aah!

714
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:31,842
Whoooaaaa...

Ha ha ha ha!

00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,646
Oh! Yes!

00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:44,921
Oh, weebo, come on.

718
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:48,959
Please, you've
got to see this.

719
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,093
Wow.

720
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:52,596
Is this what
you call heaven?

721
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,364
Almost.

722
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,366
Look at it.

723
00:33:56,434 --> 00:34:00,504
The whole world
below and beyond.

724
00:34:00,571 --> 00:34:01,605
It's beautiful.

725
00:34:01,672 --> 00:34:04,241
The solitude up here,
the stillness...

726
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:07,778
The silence.

727
00:34:07,845 --> 00:34:08,845
Uh-oh.

728
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,447
Aah!

729
00:34:10,515 --> 00:34:14,785
Aaaah!

730
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:17,320
Silly me.
Turned it off.

731
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,688
Turns right back on.

732
00:34:18,756 --> 00:34:20,624
The shutter's jammed
probably, weebo.

733
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:21,825
We're ok.

734
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:30,000
Pleeease turn on!

735
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:34,204
For the love of newton,
turn over!

00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:38,108
Abandon ship.
Abandon ship.

Aaaaaah...

00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,881
Ohhh, yes.

739
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:46,116
Oh.

740
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,322
Ah, it's such a pleasure
to spend time with you

741
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,724
Without having brainard
hovering above us.

742
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,393
Mm.

743
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:57,494
More wine?

744
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,963
No. No, thank you.

745
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,231
I have to say
good night.

746
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:04,568
I have a busy,
busy day tomorrow.

747
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:13,510
Rutland would die
to have you.

748
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,146
We'd be together
with nothing but time.

749
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,421
Sara...

750
00:35:37,034 --> 00:35:38,768
I'm sorry, wilson.

751
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:40,337
Forget it.

752
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,705
It's ok.

753
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:43,707
We have lots of time.

754
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:46,610
Listen, I'm driving up

755
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,378
On Thursday to rutland
for the game.

756
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:49,546
I'll see you there.

757
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,915
Should I make
dinner reservations?

758
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,618
Since rutland
is going to lose,
I'll pay.

759
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:55,919
All right.

760
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,121
If your team wins,
you can buy me
dinner.

761
00:35:58,189 --> 00:35:59,356
If your team loses,

762
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,491
We go up
to the mountains
for the weekend.

763
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:07,831
Cad.

764
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,167
Do we have a bet?

765
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,136
I'll think about it.

766
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,042
I can't lose.

767
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,210
She's mine.

768
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,612
Sir isaac.

769
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,348
Oh! Ow!

770
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,118
Out!

771
00:36:31,923 --> 00:36:34,491
All right.

772
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,626
One more time.

773
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,328
What happened?

774
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:39,996
He took a golf ball,

775
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,831
He rubbed
this cream on it,

776
00:36:41,899 --> 00:36:45,535
And then the golf ball
took off and--whack--

777
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:47,270
Popped smith
in the head.

778
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:48,672
Several times.

779
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:49,773
Mm-hmm.

780
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,108
I got hit
with a bowling ball.

781
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:53,610
Repeatedly.

782
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:55,812
Were you drinking?

783
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,914
No.

784
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,916
2 beers at dinner.

785
00:36:59,984 --> 00:37:00,984
Wesson had a white wine.

786
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,018
With dinner.

787
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:03,453
Right.

788
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:06,156
It's this stuff
he's got, sir.

789
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,526
It's--I don't know
what it is.

790
00:37:09,594 --> 00:37:10,860
I don't know where
it comes from,
but...

791
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,236
It will give you one
heck of a headache.

792
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:23,206
Oh...Goodness.

793
00:37:23,274 --> 00:37:26,443
Weebo: I--I wish I could
make you feel better.

794
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,712
Hmm.

795
00:37:28,779 --> 00:37:30,447
So do I.

796
00:37:30,514 --> 00:37:32,582
Oh, maybe
I'm old-fashioned,

797
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,052
But I believe a woman
should love a man
for what he is

798
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:39,122
And not for what
she wants him to be.

799
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,292
Thanks for
the sentiment, weebo.

800
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,860
This is really
not an area

801
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,263
You're qualified
to offer
perspective on.

802
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,465
Well, I don't have
much of a smile,

803
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:50,000
But I do
have a brain.

804
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:53,303
I have to deal
with this alone.

805
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:55,038
It's a human matter.

806
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:57,073
Not for computers.

807
00:37:57,141 --> 00:37:59,342
It's for people.

808
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,544
Good night, weebo.

809
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,647
Good night, professor.

810
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:49,085
Mm...

811
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,465
Hmm?

812
00:40:03,834 --> 00:40:05,435
Got it!

813
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,536
Oh, no!

814
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,240
I gotta turn
this thing off.

815
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,609
This is so
embarrassing.

816
00:40:12,676 --> 00:40:15,545
Weebo, I just had
this amazing dream.

817
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:16,880
Weebo...

818
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,748
Hurry, hurry, hurry...

819
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:20,850
Weebo...

820
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,218
Weebo...

821
00:40:22,286 --> 00:40:23,853
Weebo, wake up.

822
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,655
Mm...

823
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:28,158
Ohh...

824
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,027

I've solved
all our problems.

825
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,295
I'm all ears.

826
00:40:32,363 --> 00:40:35,965
Flubber is going
to the basketball game.

827
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:36,966
Ha ha...

828
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:38,001
Basketball?

829
00:40:38,068 --> 00:40:54,851
Yes.

830
00:41:12,169 --> 00:41:13,470
Testing, testing.

831
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,959
Applying a thin layer
of fluid flubber

832
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:38,595
To synthetic leather
surface of basketball.

833
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,098
Application complete.

834
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,416
Wow.

835
00:42:04,488 --> 00:42:05,522
Oops.

836
00:42:08,893 --> 00:42:10,126
2 points.

837
00:42:25,643 --> 00:42:27,944
Implementing plan "b."

838
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:30,280
Very tight...

839
00:42:30,347 --> 00:42:31,581
Tight...

840
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:35,585
Careful, careful, careful.

841
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:37,020
Ahh.

842
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,394
Secondary
flubber experiment.

843
00:42:44,461 --> 00:42:48,831
Control elements--bungee cord,
3:1 elasticity ratio,

844
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,100
50 pound ballast,

845
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,336
Commencing now.

846
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,138
Wish me luck.

847
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,541
Oh...

848
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:00,777
Whooooaaaooh!

849
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,113
Yes!

850
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,786
Ohhh...

851
00:43:09,853 --> 00:43:10,920
Gotcha.

852
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:18,227
Bungee! Bungee!

853
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:22,532
Help!

854
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:25,368
Aah!

855
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:29,105
Aaaaaah!

856
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:40,917
It worked!

857
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,619
Ha ha ha ha.

858
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:43,820
Yes.

859
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:44,787
Ahem.

860
00:43:44,855 --> 00:43:46,322
End test.

861
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,367
[muffled]
did you fully fix
the flubber on each tack

862
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,035
Before we painted?

863
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,738
Excuse me, darth vader,
but what did you say?

864
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:05,241
Did you fully fix
a 15% flubber solution
to each tack

865
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,342
Before weber
started painting?

866
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:07,510
Yes. I'm positive.

867
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,544
Excellent.

868
00:44:08,612 --> 00:44:10,246
And how long
does it take

869
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,648
The paint
to wear off?

870
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,416
30 minutes.

871
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,586
Be a little suspicious
if the flubber started
working immediately.

872
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,354
Uh, isn't this
cheating?

873
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:20,490
No, it's not cheating.
It's equalizing.

874
00:44:20,557 --> 00:44:21,624
You've seen the team.

875
00:44:21,692 --> 00:44:23,059
They should have
their own telethon.

876
00:44:23,127 --> 00:44:25,495
Come on. We've got to
win this game.

877
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:28,398
I've got to do it
to prove to sara that
flubber really works.

878
00:44:28,465 --> 00:44:32,635
I'm gonna do it
right under
wilson croft's nose.

879
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:34,637
Don't fail me.

880
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,349
Weebo.
Yes.

881
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:49,018
While I'm out,
you're in charge, ok?

882
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:50,019
Ok.

883
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:51,054
No phone calls
to russia again.

884
00:44:51,121 --> 00:44:52,455
I think
that was weber.

885
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:56,059
Oh--make sure the flubber
stays in the tank.

886
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:57,160
Got it.

887
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,895
Under no circumstances
are you to release it.

888
00:44:58,962 --> 00:44:59,862
Of course.

889
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,130
'cause you know
what would happen.

890
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:02,098
Ho ho ho.

891
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,132
Do you
understand?

892
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,133
Yes, sir.
I understand.

893
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,802
Promise?

894
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,570
Have no fear.

895
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,338
That's my girl.

896
00:45:11,075 --> 00:45:14,711
Go, medfield!
Ha ha ha...

897
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:17,447
Ok...

898
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:18,481
P.A. Announcer:
Good evening, everybody,

899
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,716
And welcome to
rutland arena

900
00:45:19,783 --> 00:45:22,051
For the 86th meeting
of the rutland rangers

901
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,986
And the medfield squirrels.

902
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,421
Rutland, if they can
just stay awake,

903
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,991
Should be able to
steamroller the squirrels
here tonight...

904
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:33,996
All right, squirrels!
Listen up, here, now.

905
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:38,768
Ok, rutland may have us
in height and reach,

906
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:41,304
Weight and power...

907
00:45:41,371 --> 00:45:43,239
Agility, speed, and talent.

908
00:45:43,307 --> 00:45:46,409
They have the advantage
on offense

909
00:45:46,477 --> 00:45:48,778
And defense.

910
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:52,048
Sure,
they're better coached,

911
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:54,383
Better trained,

912
00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:59,422
And their will to win is
unmatched in the conference.

913
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:05,628
They're undefeated
in their last 108 games.

914
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:11,167
But that doesn't mean
we can't whip these guys, right?

915
00:46:11,235 --> 00:46:13,236
[whistle blows]

916
00:46:27,718 --> 00:46:28,951
Ohh...

917

Rutland!

920
00:46:51,408 --> 00:46:52,775
Ok, flubber,

921
00:46:52,843 --> 00:46:56,312
It's time that you and I
got to know each other.

922
00:47:04,955 --> 00:47:07,757
Announcer: Another easy basket
for the rutland rangers.

923
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:12,929
They have built up
a commanding lead
in the first half.

924
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:19,669
Evening, sara.

925
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,770
Excuse--

926
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,505
What a coincidence.

927
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:38,154
Come on, you guys!
You gotta--

928
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:40,389
Not now, herbie,
not now!

929
00:47:40,457 --> 00:47:42,625
Go, medfield!

[horn blares]

931
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,028
Ow!

932
00:47:46,096 --> 00:47:48,865
Oh, sorry. Sorry, wilson.

933
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:58,574
See if you can
get me another
10 grand on rutland.

934
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:03,946
You got a problem,
bennett?

935
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:05,648
You're betting
against my team?

936
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,049
It's not your team.

937
00:48:07,117 --> 00:48:09,752
They threw you off,
remember that?

938
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,626
Ooh, baby,
that's got to hurt.

939
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:19,662
He fouled him!
He threw his hip
into that.

940
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,004
Flubber?

941
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,706
Flubber! Where are you?

If coach barker
has any sense, he has
to be thinking forfeit...

948
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:48,044
Come on, boys.
Expect the unexpected.

son, you can do it.

Here we go.

It's--

Oh.

00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,426
That's pretty good.

Hey! Are you blind?

971

They're doing something
illegal out here.

Look, coach, nowhere
in the rule book

973

Does it say anything
about jumping too high.

974

Now sit down.

975

a lonely weekend

for you, croft.

Coach:
This game is
not over yet.

990
00:53:44,654 --> 00:53:46,622
You just want
to steal the ball...

991
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,824
Excuse me, boys,
educator coming through.

992
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,227
Coach, I know very little
about basketball,

993
00:53:51,294 --> 00:53:52,361
But I do know chemistry.

994
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:54,263
And I believe that dale
is having a problem,

995
00:53:54,331 --> 00:53:55,331
Not with motivation,

996

But with some sort of
adhesive build up

In the bottom of his shoes.

Do you have any
ethyl alcohol?
What?

Hello, dale.

May I see your sole?

of your shoe.

with all your soul.

1008
00:54:23,326 --> 00:54:25,761
But I'm on this end, sir.

1009
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:28,330
Jump, or I'll flunk you.

1010
00:54:28,398 --> 00:54:29,431
What?

1011
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:30,566
You heard me.

1012
00:54:30,634 --> 00:54:33,569
Jump, or I'll flunk you
out of my department.

1013
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,570
For good.

1014
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,772
Ok.

1015
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,077
I think that's
a little harsh...

1016
00:54:42,145 --> 00:54:43,712
Jump!

1017
00:54:45,915 --> 00:54:47,182
Announcer:
The medfield squirrels

1018
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,351
Are trying to complete
this astonishing comeback.

1019
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:50,719
Be patient, rutland.
Plenty of time, baby.

1020
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,156
Rutland has the lead with
the clock winding down.

1021
00:54:54,224 --> 00:54:56,759
These rodents have fought
their little hearts out
tonight,

1022
00:54:56,826 --> 00:54:57,993
But it looks like
the squirrels

1023
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,496
Are gonna come up a couple
of nuts short of a bushel.

1024
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:01,563
Playing keep away
are the rangers.

1025
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:03,332
Here's a wide open
"j" by hatch.

1026
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:06,302
Jump, dale! Jump!

1027
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:08,737
Announcer:
Jepner soaring into the air.

1028
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:10,839
He makes the steal.
Look at him go!

1029
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,107
Jepner with wings
on his shoes

1030
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:13,842
Soaring to the other end.

1031
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,145
He soars. He dives.

1032
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,180
And medfield upsets rutland

1033
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,749
On an incredible play
by dale jepner.

1034
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:23,519
And the squirrels
are going nuts.

1035
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:24,653
We won!

1036
00:55:24,721 --> 00:55:26,021
We did it!
We did it!

1037
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:29,224
Foul! Since when is it
within the rules

1038
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:31,360
For a player
to accompany the ball
through the hoop?

1039
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,328
Oh, I don't know.

1040
00:55:32,395 --> 00:55:34,229
Come on, I'll
buy you dinner.

1041
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,533
Sara?

1042
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:39,635
Good night, philip.
Good night.

1043
00:55:43,306 --> 00:55:46,108
Brainard had something
to do with this.

1044
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:49,044
It's the same stuff
we saw the other night

1045
00:55:49,112 --> 00:55:50,145
Over at his house.

1046
00:55:50,213 --> 00:55:51,947
Right.

1047
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,685
I don't know how, but
I'm absolutely certain

1048
00:55:56,753 --> 00:55:59,088
That your team cheated.

1049
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,090
You're just
being a sore loser.

1050
00:56:01,157 --> 00:56:02,658
Sara?

1051
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,226
May I speak to you
for a moment?

1052
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,494
Alone?

1053
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:06,562
What you have
to say to her

1054
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:08,297
You can say
to both of us.

1055
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:09,798
If you can remember.

1056
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:13,736
Sara...

1057
00:56:13,803 --> 00:56:16,004
Flubber.

1058
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:18,741
Flubber? Sounds like
baby shampoo.

1059
00:56:22,112 --> 00:56:24,713
Flubber.
It's what won the game.

1060
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,949
That amazing aerial ballet?

1061
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,451
Because I flubberized
the boys' shoes.

1062
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:32,087
A little on the bottom...

1063
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:34,890
You're remarkable.

1064
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,630
Sara?

1065
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:44,600
Good night, philip.

1066
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,768
Watch yourself.

1067
00:56:48,638 --> 00:56:49,705
Now, what do
we have to do

1068
00:56:49,773 --> 00:56:51,373
To get you
to take a hint?

1069
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,709
It's over, philip.
You lost.

1070
00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,978
Go home. Play with
your rubber.

1071
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:29,178
What kind of car does
that brainard fellow drive?

1072
00:57:29,245 --> 00:57:31,580
Old t-bird. Why?

1073
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,682
I just saw it.

1074
00:57:33,750 --> 00:57:35,017
So?

1075
00:57:35,084 --> 00:57:38,287
It was flying.

1076
00:57:39,856 --> 00:57:42,958
You heard me. Flying.

1077
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:52,568
Weebo: Hey, who won?

1078
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:53,936
We did.

1079
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,005
Um, professor?

1080
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,675
Why the long face?

1081
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:03,745
I think you know why.

1082
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,180
Would it be...

1083
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:07,916
A sara issue?

1084
00:58:09,686 --> 00:58:13,021
Wish I understood
human beings.

1085
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:16,258
Wish I understood women.

1086
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:18,794
Wish I understood
emotions and passions.

1087
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,462
Wish I understood any of that.

1088
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:23,732
If I did, I wouldn't have had
to spend my entire life

1089
00:58:23,800 --> 00:58:25,133
In a laboratory
trying to figure out

1090
00:58:25,201 --> 00:58:26,401
How the world works.

1091
00:58:26,469 --> 00:58:27,402
I would have been
out in the world

1092
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:29,972
Trying to figure out
why it works.

1093
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:35,310
I know I love her, weebo.

1094
00:58:37,247 --> 00:58:39,581
Every neuron
in my limbic system

1095
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,350
Is saturated
with phenylethamine.

1096
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:45,187
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

1097
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:47,656
Truth is, weebo...

1098
00:58:47,724 --> 00:58:51,727
I'm not absent minded because
I'm selfish, crazy, or...

1099
00:58:51,794 --> 00:58:54,496
Or inconsiderate.

1100
00:58:54,564 --> 00:58:57,833
I'm absent minded because
I'm in love with sara.

1101
00:58:57,901 --> 00:58:59,768
Professor...

1102
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:03,071
That doesn't matter anymore...

1103
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:07,175
'cause I don't get
any more chances with her.

1104
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:08,610
Now, that's not true.

1105
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:09,945
There's always
another chance.

1106
00:59:10,013 --> 00:59:11,580
I mean,
you never know, right?

1107
00:59:11,648 --> 00:59:14,616
Probably just as well
that it's over.

1108
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,386
She has to move on.

1109
00:59:17,453 --> 00:59:19,788
I'm not right for her.

1110
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:22,424
But you knew that,
didn't you, weebo?

1111
00:59:22,492 --> 00:59:24,860
Huh?
You never wanted me
to marry her.

1112
00:59:24,928 --> 00:59:28,330
Hmph. Well,
you were right.

1113
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,666
I wasn't right
for her.

1114
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,735
You're the one
for me, weebo.

1115
00:59:33,803 --> 00:59:36,605
Just the two of us.

1116
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:38,574
And flubber makes 3.

1117
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:41,677
Good night, weebo.

1118
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,979
Good night.

1119
00:59:44,047 --> 00:59:47,416
Uh...Uh,
profes...Sor...

1120
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,790
And this is
the god's truth.

1121
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:57,459
I want him to have
what he wants.

1122
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,762
Even if it means you
instead of me.

1123
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,784
Ooh.

1124
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:37,699
Sara?

1125
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:38,867
Sara, it's me.

1126
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,569
Weebo.

1127
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:42,371
May I come in?

1128
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,706
Oh, I'm sorry to
wake you like this.

1129
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:46,975
But I can't ring
the doorbell.

1130
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,779
Is everything ok
with philip?

1131
01:00:50,847 --> 01:00:51,847
Oh, yeah.

1132
01:00:51,914 --> 01:00:54,583
It's not
a conventional
emergency.

1133
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,886
Oh, philip would be very angry
if he knew I left.

1134
01:00:57,954 --> 01:01:00,622
But I have to show you
something.

1135
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:03,325
Do you have a minute?

1136
01:01:03,393 --> 01:01:04,626
Listen.

1137
01:01:04,694 --> 01:01:08,063
I know I love her,
weebo.

1138
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,233
Every neuron
in my limbic system

1139
01:01:11,300 --> 01:01:13,535
Is saturated with
phenylethamine.

1140
01:01:13,603 --> 01:01:17,673
That triggers euphoria,
elation, exhilaration.

1141
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:18,874
Truth is, weebo...

1142
01:01:18,941 --> 01:01:21,109
I'm not absent minded
because I'm selfish,

1143
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:25,147
Crazy or...
Or inconsiderate.

1144
01:01:25,214 --> 01:01:29,284
I'm absent minded
because I'm in love
with sara.

1145
01:01:36,325 --> 01:01:39,294
This will be
our little secret.

1146
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,075
[whispering]
philip.

1147
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,985
Sara?

1148
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,342
Sara: This is it.

1149
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,711
This is the solution.

1150
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,580
This is how we save
the school.

1151
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:34,616
That's what
I've been saying.

1152
01:02:34,684 --> 01:02:35,984
Flubber.

1153
01:02:36,052 --> 01:02:37,319
You saw what it did
at the game.

1154
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:38,453
Yes.

1155
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,122
Imagine the line
of shoes we could
develop.

1156
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:41,523
Oh, no, no, no, philip.

1157
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,692
Not shoes, no.

1158
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:46,228
Look...This.

1159
01:02:46,295 --> 01:02:47,596
Flight.

1160
01:02:47,663 --> 01:02:48,630
Flight?

1161
01:02:48,698 --> 01:02:49,831
Yes.

1162
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:51,299
Oh, of course.

1163
01:02:51,367 --> 01:02:52,334
Air travel.

1164
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,668
Oh, sara.

1165
01:02:53,736 --> 01:02:54,736
Air travel.

1166
01:02:54,804 --> 01:02:56,505
Yes.

1167
01:02:56,572 --> 01:02:58,373
We better sell this
to a car company.

1168
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:00,142
Oh, philip.

1169
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,426
Dr. Reynolds.

1170
01:03:18,494 --> 01:03:19,961
Professor.

1171
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:22,097
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

1172
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,034
I believe
you know my son.

1173
01:03:26,102 --> 01:03:29,104
He used to play
basketball
for medfield.

1174
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:32,107
Lovely old car.

1175
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:35,110
Mind if I take a look
under the hood?

1176
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:37,579
Yes, I do.

1177
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,782
And I don't appreciate
you gentlemen

1178
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:43,018
Letting yourselves
onto my property.

1179
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:47,122
I expected something
more complex.

1180
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,926
There's a lot of money
in your discovery.

1181
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:54,362
Perhaps we could
make a deal.

1182
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,432
Any discovery I make

1183
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,100
Will belong
to medfield college.

1184
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:02,237
At the end of the term
there isn't going to be
a medfield college.

1185
01:04:02,305 --> 01:04:03,505
We'll see
about that.

1186
01:04:03,573 --> 01:04:06,274
You could make
a lot of money.

1187
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,045
If we were interested
in making money,

1188
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:12,314
We wouldn't have
become teachers.

1189
01:04:12,381 --> 01:04:15,317
You think you'll
be able to sell it
for what you owe me

1190
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,953
By the end of the term?

1191
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:19,521
We will.

1192
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:21,756
I'll forget the debt
right now.

1193
01:04:22,959 --> 01:04:25,727
No. I'm not selling.

1194
01:04:25,795 --> 01:04:29,631
When I leave I take
my offer with me.

1195
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:32,133
We understand.

1196
01:04:32,201 --> 01:04:35,070
Good luck.

1197
01:04:40,676 --> 01:04:42,777
Watch your back,
smart guy.

1198
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:44,980
Bad move, professor.

1199
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,395
Good morning!

1200
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,567
Pardon me, mr. Seldon.

1201
01:05:05,635 --> 01:05:08,937
Are you interested in seeing
a philip brainard?

1202
01:05:09,005 --> 01:05:10,105
Who?

1203
01:05:10,172 --> 01:05:13,541
He's the college professor
you spoke to on the 6th

1204
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:15,644
About a brand new
car design.

1205
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:16,878
Tell him I'm busy.

1206
01:05:16,946 --> 01:05:19,047
Thank him
for the interest.

1207
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:21,049
And send him a hat.

1208
01:05:21,117 --> 01:05:22,217
He's here.
[car horn honks]

1209
01:05:22,285 --> 01:05:24,352
He's right outside.

1210
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:50,679

What?

1223
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:11,459
Think I found it.

1224
01:07:11,527 --> 01:07:14,295
You found it all right!

1225
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:18,333
Ooh.

1226
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,269
What was that?

01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:22,837

Did you get it?

1232
01:08:16,525 --> 01:08:17,659
Yeah.

1233

I-I-I've never seen
so many zeros.

1234

When they saw us flying,
they couldn't wait
to write the check.

1235
01:08:37,213 --> 01:08:40,482
This will save
the school, philip.

Do have a signal?

Do you have

It's me

It's gonna be
all right.

1262
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,822
It's like that time
you ran into the wall

1263
01:10:27,890 --> 01:10:29,924
When I first made you.

1264
01:10:29,992 --> 01:10:32,994
We'll get you upstairs,
hooked up to a.C. And...

She's losing--
she's losing power.

It's all right.

1268
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:44,505
I've just gotta get you
to the docking station

So I can make repairs.

Good-bye, my friend.

1271
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:44,632
I don't know what
to do with her.

What happens to the soul
of a machine, sara?

1273
01:11:53,409 --> 01:11:55,910
Can you fix her?

1274
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,613
I could make repairs,

1275
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:02,150
But I can never
bring back the life
and will she had.

1276
01:12:02,217 --> 01:12:05,153
That's gone.

1277
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:06,888

it was to begin with.

glorious accident.

1279

I kept trying
to recreate it

1280
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,995
And isolate it and
find out what it was.

1281
01:12:14,063 --> 01:12:15,630
I never could.

1282
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,535
What was that word

1283
01:12:20,602 --> 01:12:23,838
She was displaying
on her screen at the end?

1284
01:12:23,906 --> 01:12:26,574
Probably a file name.

1285
01:12:26,642 --> 01:12:28,810
Why was she displaying it?

1286
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:30,111
She was damaged.

1287
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:32,780
It's--download--random
piece of information.

No.

If I was human, that is.

1297
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:10,952
If you're watching this,
I'm no longer here.

1298
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:15,890
I hope my demise
didn't cause you
any undue distress.

1302
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:26,267
I never showed it
to you.

1303
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,438
I've made a few changes.

1304
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:34,075
I've removed
a few of my flaws

1305
01:13:34,143 --> 01:13:37,945
And added
a little of you.

1306
01:13:39,748 --> 01:13:43,184
I hope that you can
love my daughter

1307
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:46,087
As much as I loved you.

1308
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:27,161
Ooh.

1309
01:14:35,137 --> 01:14:38,172

Surprise, surprise.

1310
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:41,843

dr. Reynolds...

1311
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:43,244
Good evening.

1312
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,712
Sit down.

1313
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:49,250
Chester: You look, uh...

1314
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:50,251
Bennett: Weary.

1315
01:14:50,319 --> 01:14:51,752
Yes.

1316
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:53,721
Weary.

1317
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,590
You came to repay
your loan?

1318
01:14:55,657 --> 01:14:56,524
No.

1319
01:14:56,592 --> 01:14:57,859
I know you didn't.

1320
01:14:57,926 --> 01:15:00,127
I was just having
a little fun.

1321
01:15:00,195 --> 01:15:02,563
I'm here to sell you
the flubber.

1322
01:15:02,631 --> 01:15:05,132
You been to your house
recently?

1323
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:06,901
Yes.

1324
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,971
Do I really need
to buy it?

1325
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:13,774
Flubber's a very
quixotic substance.

1326
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:15,810
It's very difficult
to handle.

1327
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:17,812
If you try to do
anything with it--

1328
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,281
My man is working on it.

1329
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:22,216
It won't be a problem.

1330
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:25,786
I can make it
a lot easier for you.

1331
01:15:25,854 --> 01:15:28,689
If you give us a 30-day
extension on the loan,

1332
01:15:28,757 --> 01:15:30,791
I'll tell you
everything I know

1333
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,727
And make you
a great deal of flubber.

1334
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:35,796
I'll give you
the 30 days,

1335
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:39,166
And after that,
you give me 2 years.

1336
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:43,337
Whatever you come up with
over the next 2 years is mine.

1337
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,573
That's not fair.

1338
01:15:45,641 --> 01:15:48,276
Shop somewhere else, lady.

1339
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:51,379
I'll do it.

1340
01:15:54,182 --> 01:15:55,750
May I see the flubber?

1341
01:15:55,817 --> 01:15:59,954
Would you like to show
these good people
to the library?

Shame on you.

Welcome.

1352
01:16:57,512 --> 01:16:59,914
So you finally
gave up teaching.

1353
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,616
How could I pass up
the opportunity

1354
01:17:01,683 --> 01:17:04,885
To transform
the energy industry.

Very interesting, phil.

1357
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:10,424
Too bad
it's so unstable.

1358
01:17:10,492 --> 01:17:13,928
I was just looking over
the formula.

1359
01:17:13,996 --> 01:17:15,396
Dangerous mix.

1360
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:17,898
You just have to know
how to deal with it, really.

1361
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:18,899
It just takes a few
simple precautions.

Hang on, einsteen.

Whatever.

1365
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,342
What's this?

1366
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:32,279
It's a hand cream
that acts as
a separating agent.

1367
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:33,781
Right.

It's so I can handle
the flubber.

01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,289
It's ok.

What's it for?

1378
01:18:04,379 --> 01:18:07,815
I use that to lower
the temperature
of the tank.

1379
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,116
Let him have it.

1380

No, no.
Give it to him.

No. No, no.

and give it to him.

Look, put it in his hand
and give it to him!

No, no, no, no!
