2
00:00:58,974 --> 00:01:00,601
Mutants...

3
00:01:00,767 --> 00:01:03,737
born with extraordinary abilities...

4
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:08,947
and yet, still, they are children
stumbling in the dark...

5
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:10,782
searching for guidance.

6
00:01:12,404 --> 00:01:15,328
A gift can often be a curse.

7
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:20,792
Give someone wings,
and they may fly too close to the sun.

8
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:25,000
Give them the power of prophecy...

9
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:27,510
and they may live in fear of the future.

10
00:01:28,169 --> 00:01:30,263
Give them the greatest gifts of all...

11
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,683
powers beyond imagination...

12
00:01:34,426 --> 00:01:38,181
and they may think they're meant
to rule the world.

13
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:59,956
En Sabah Nur.

14
00:03:19,698 --> 00:03:23,168
Now you will rule for eternity, my lord.

15
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,342
Sleep.

16
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:45,273
Let the transference begin.

17
00:05:14,062 --> 00:05:16,064
Death to the false god.

18
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:37,760
Protect him!

19
00:08:20,289 --> 00:08:23,839
As everyone knows, the existence
of mutants was first discovered...

20
00:08:23,918 --> 00:08:28,094
during the Paris Peace Accords,
after the Vietnam War in 1973.

21
00:08:28,464 --> 00:08:31,263
Six days later, we all watched
as one of those mutants...

22
00:08:33,344 --> 00:08:35,517
Erik Lehnsherr, attacked the President...

23
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,229
and the Cabinet on the lawn
of the White House.

24
00:08:38,391 --> 00:08:42,362
Their lives were saved
by a young mutant who stopped him.

25
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,570
Now, Lehnsherr escaped and became
the world's most-wanted fugitive.

26
00:08:46,733 --> 00:08:48,326
And as for her, she disappeared as well.

27
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,658
But she has become the symbol
of a new age...

28
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:54,244
the face of a world
that will never be the same again.

29
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:56,080
You winking at my girl?

30
00:08:57,201 --> 00:08:58,327
Your girl?

31
00:08:59,078 --> 00:09:01,456
I guess you do look old enough
to be her father.

32
00:09:02,623 --> 00:09:03,670
Excuse me, gentlemen...

33
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:06,632
is there something you'd like
to share with the rest of the class?

34
00:09:06,794 --> 00:09:08,512
Can I please go to the bathroom?

35
00:09:08,671 --> 00:09:10,264
I think there's something
seriously wrong with my eyes.

36
00:09:11,174 --> 00:09:12,346
Fine, Scott. And afterwards...

37
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:14,931
why don't you stop by the principal's
office and explain to him...

38
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:16,391
that you're disrupting class again?

39
00:09:17,847 --> 00:09:19,565
I trust you know the way.

40
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:21,101
- Yeah, I do.
- Okay.

41
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,896
No, hang on! Hang on!

42
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,737
Hey!

43
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,153
Now, I know most of you were, what?

44
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:33,037
Around seven years old at that time?

45
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,961
Summers!

46
00:09:46,292 --> 00:09:48,590
I know you're in here.

47
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,051
What, are you crying?

48
00:09:52,006 --> 00:09:53,349
I haven't even kicked your ass yet.

49
00:09:55,927 --> 00:09:57,850
Summers! You want to eyeball my girl?

50
00:10:45,518 --> 00:10:46,485
Yeah!

51
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:48,154
Ten fights waged.

52
00:10:48,229 --> 00:10:49,697
Ten fights won.

53
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:51,574
The Winged Warrior.

54
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:53,576
The Bird of Prey.

55
00:10:53,734 --> 00:10:54,986
The Angel of Death.

56
00:10:55,069 --> 00:10:56,571
ANGEL!

57
00:10:56,904 --> 00:10:57,996
Yeah!

58
00:11:03,244 --> 00:11:06,293
Let's hear it for the fat man!

59
00:11:06,831 --> 00:11:09,254
Our next challenger...

60
00:11:09,584 --> 00:11:10,927
comes straight...

61
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:14,256
from the Munich Circus.

62
00:11:15,381 --> 00:11:16,257
Ladies and gentlemen,

63
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:20,186
the only one that could take on an Angel...

64
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:21,604
is the Devil himself.

65
00:11:23,264 --> 00:11:24,857
I give you...

66
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:27,188
the amazing...

67
00:11:27,852 --> 00:11:29,229
the fantastic...

68
00:11:30,104 --> 00:11:32,402
NIGHTCRAWLER!

69
00:11:52,126 --> 00:11:52,877
Caution

70
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,512
High voltage!

71
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,848
Sorry mutants!

72
00:12:11,979 --> 00:12:13,196
Hey.

73
00:12:13,272 --> 00:12:15,240
Did you get lost little mouse?

74
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:16,735
The fight is over there.

75
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,742
Fight!

76
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,157
Or they'll kill us both!

77
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:26,836
And it's about to get exciting.

78
00:12:27,787 --> 00:12:29,164
Ah, you mean this?

79
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:51,944
Nightcrawler!

80
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:59,027
Nightcrawler! Nightcrawler!

81
00:12:59,193 --> 00:13:00,035
I'm sorry.

82
00:13:00,194 --> 00:13:01,320
I'm sorry!

83
00:13:42,069 --> 00:13:43,161
They went that way!

84
00:13:49,243 --> 00:13:50,085
You can...

85
00:13:50,995 --> 00:13:51,996
transform.

86
00:13:52,371 --> 00:13:53,372
You're her.

87
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:54,791
- The hero.
- I'm nobody.

88
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:55,958
I'm not a hero.

89
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,092
Let's get out of here.

90
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,032
Have a good night, Henryk.

91
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:22,451
You too, Milosz.

92
00:14:52,181 --> 00:14:53,182
Hi, Honey.

93
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:54,267
Hi.

94
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:00,148
Good day?

95
00:15:00,314 --> 00:15:01,486
Better now.

96
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:03,192
Where's Nina?

97
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,612
Out back. With her friends.

98
00:15:34,348 --> 00:15:36,646
Where did you learn that song, Papa?

99
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,355
I learned it from my parents.

100
00:15:41,313 --> 00:15:43,361
And they learned it from their parents.

101
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:46,360
And them from theirs.

102
00:15:47,194 --> 00:15:48,662
And one day...

103
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:51,373
you'll sing it to your children, too.

104
00:15:53,075 --> 00:15:54,372
What happened to them?

105
00:15:54,535 --> 00:15:55,752
Your parents.

106
00:15:59,498 --> 00:16:01,375
They were taken from me...

107
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:03,378
when I was a little boy.

108
00:16:06,881 --> 00:16:08,258
But they're still here.

109
00:16:09,091 --> 00:16:10,263
Inside.

110
00:16:12,636 --> 00:16:14,058
And here.

111
00:16:15,389 --> 00:16:16,390
With you.

112
00:16:16,891 --> 00:16:20,065
Is someone going to take you away?

113
00:16:21,479 --> 00:16:23,402
Never.

114
00:16:39,413 --> 00:16:41,415
I guess we're more alike than we thought.

115
00:16:41,582 --> 00:16:42,959
He won't listen to us.

116
00:16:43,459 --> 00:16:44,927
He's just... He's being...

117
00:16:45,085 --> 00:16:46,177
Scott.

118
00:16:49,507 --> 00:16:50,508
Let me try.

119
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,983
Smells pretty old in here.

120
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:08,693
Is this a school or a museum?

121
00:17:08,776 --> 00:17:11,450
One more. And last one.

122
00:17:11,737 --> 00:17:13,080
There you go.

123
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,241
I'll see you guys.

124
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,377
Watch where you're going.

125
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,545
I can't.

126
00:17:28,837 --> 00:17:29,838
Who are you talking to?

127
00:17:30,005 --> 00:17:30,972
Me.

128
00:17:33,175 --> 00:17:34,427
I just heard you in my head.

129
00:17:35,344 --> 00:17:37,017
I'm telepathic. I read minds.

130
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:38,180
Well, stay out of mine.

131
00:17:38,347 --> 00:17:40,349
I don't need some weird girl
creeping around in there.

132
00:17:41,267 --> 00:17:43,019
Don't worry, Scott.
There's not much to see.

133
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:46,481
Hey, wait. I didn't tell you my name.

134
00:17:46,647 --> 00:17:48,194
No, you didn't.

135
00:17:49,275 --> 00:17:50,572
Alex Summers?

136
00:17:51,318 --> 00:17:52,661
Hank McCoy!

137
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,539
Whoa! What happened to the
big, blue, furry you?

138
00:17:55,698 --> 00:17:57,496
I keep him under control now.

139
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,411
This is my brother, Scott.

140
00:18:00,578 --> 00:18:03,081
Hey, Scott. I'm Hank McCoy.
I'm one of the teachers here.

141
00:18:05,624 --> 00:18:06,921
Where's the professor?

142
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:10,763
"To break forth bloodily,
then the past must be obliterated...

143
00:18:11,255 --> 00:18:13,383
"and a new start made.

144
00:18:13,549 --> 00:18:15,051
"Let us now start fresh...

145
00:18:15,217 --> 00:18:17,140
"without remembrance...

146
00:18:17,303 --> 00:18:21,524
"rather than live forward and backward
at the same time."

147
00:18:21,682 --> 00:18:24,982
Now, what on earth do we think
that the author meant...

148
00:18:25,144 --> 00:18:26,521
when he wrote all that?

149
00:18:28,397 --> 00:18:31,446
That's going to be
your assignment for tomorrow.

150
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:33,782
Top marks, everyone. Class dismissed.

151
00:18:35,112 --> 00:18:35,908
Alex.

152
00:18:36,071 --> 00:18:38,073
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

153
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,662
You look well. It's been a while.

154
00:18:39,825 --> 00:18:41,293
It has. Not too bad yourself.

155
00:18:41,452 --> 00:18:42,499
Thank you.

156
00:18:43,162 --> 00:18:44,254
This is my brother, Scott.

157
00:18:45,581 --> 00:18:48,460
Hello, Scott.
Welcome to the School for the Gifted.

158
00:18:49,126 --> 00:18:50,969
Yeah. It doesn't exactly feel like a gift.

159
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:53,839
It never does, at first.

160
00:18:56,717 --> 00:18:58,936
The first step in
understanding one's power...

161
00:18:59,094 --> 00:19:00,937
is learning the extent of it.

162
00:19:01,096 --> 00:19:04,191
Only then can we begin the process
of teaching you how to control it.

163
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,149
If you do decide to stay,
I can promise you...

164
00:19:07,311 --> 00:19:11,316
that by the time you're done here,
you'll be able to go back into the world...

165
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:13,200
and play a stable and productive part in it.

166
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:14,576
Why don't you take your bandages off...

167
00:19:14,735 --> 00:19:17,284
and we can have a look
at what we're dealing with here?

168
00:19:17,446 --> 00:19:20,746
Alex, would you line him up?
Face him in the right direction, as it were.

169
00:19:20,908 --> 00:19:22,376
There's a target just across the water.

170
00:19:22,534 --> 00:19:23,831
When you open your eyes, try and hit that.

171
00:19:28,082 --> 00:19:29,425
You can open your eyes, Scott.

172
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,298
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's quite...

173
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:40,097
Look out! Get back!

174
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,637
Get back! Get back!

175
00:19:47,101 --> 00:19:49,945
My grandfather planted that tree
when he was five years old.

176
00:19:50,104 --> 00:19:51,321
I used to swing...

177
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,528
from the branches of it, myself.

178
00:19:57,695 --> 00:19:59,242
I think that was probably
my favorite tree.

179
00:20:00,364 --> 00:20:02,207
Does that mean I'm expelled?

180
00:20:02,366 --> 00:20:03,583
On the contrary.

181
00:20:04,993 --> 00:20:06,119
You're enrolled.

182
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:57,171
Do you sell rugs?

183
00:20:57,379 --> 00:20:59,507
You're not allowed in this area.

184
00:20:59,673 --> 00:21:01,391
This rug is for sale?

185
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:02,346
I said, this...

186
00:25:04,668 --> 00:25:05,590
Earthquake!

187
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:53,884
Back to bed, please, my darling.
Back to bed.

188
00:25:54,051 --> 00:25:55,052
She's doing it again.

189
00:25:55,218 --> 00:25:57,095
Back to bed, please, everyone.

190
00:25:57,262 --> 00:25:58,388
Jesse, back to bed, please.

191
00:25:58,555 --> 00:26:00,057
Come on now. Spit-spot, back to bed.

192
00:26:00,223 --> 00:26:01,770
Carrie Anne, come on now. Back to bed.

193
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:12,115
Never seen it like this.

194
00:26:12,277 --> 00:26:13,494
Nor I.

195
00:26:14,613 --> 00:26:16,456
Don't let any of the children
come this way.

196
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:38,136
Jean.

197
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:00,625
Jean!

198
00:27:03,203 --> 00:27:04,876
Jean!

199
00:27:13,296 --> 00:27:15,469
I saw the end of the world.

200
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:17,559
I could feel...

201
00:27:17,717 --> 00:27:19,890
all this death.

202
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,557
It was just a dream.

203
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:25,396
No, it felt real.

204
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:26,560
I know.

205
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:30,189
Your mind is the most powerful
I've ever seen.

206
00:27:30,522 --> 00:27:31,648
It can convince itself...

207
00:27:31,815 --> 00:27:33,533
No, no...

208
00:27:33,692 --> 00:27:35,660
It's not just the mind-reading
or the telekinesis...

209
00:27:35,819 --> 00:27:37,321
it's something else.

210
00:27:40,574 --> 00:27:43,544
Some dark power inside and it's growing.

211
00:27:43,702 --> 00:27:45,079
Like a fire.

212
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:47,710
I thought I was getting better.

213
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:48,920
You are.

214
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:50,425
You will.

215
00:27:51,209 --> 00:27:52,256
You just have to be patient.

216
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:55,844
No, no. You don't know what it's like
to be afraid to shut your eyes.

217
00:27:56,006 --> 00:27:58,429
To be trapped inside your own head.

218
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:00,390
Oh, I think I do.

219
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:04,265
It wasn't so long ago that
I was plagued by voices, myself.

220
00:28:05,223 --> 00:28:06,725
All their suffering.

221
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:07,939
All their pain.

222
00:28:08,768 --> 00:28:10,270
Their secrets.

223
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:16,697
I'm afraid one day
I'm going to hurt someone.

224
00:28:19,779 --> 00:28:21,281
Lie back.

225
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:34,966
Everyone fears that
which they do not understand.

226
00:28:37,047 --> 00:28:39,641
You will learn to control your powers.

227
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,642
And when you do...

228
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:44,145
you'll have nothing to fear.

229
00:28:46,556 --> 00:28:48,103
Her nightmares were different this time.

230
00:28:48,266 --> 00:28:51,145
It could account for something I saw
when I was in my lab earlier.

231
00:28:51,311 --> 00:28:53,405
There was some kind of tremor.
Like an energy surge.

232
00:28:53,563 --> 00:28:55,156
I picked it up on one of my meters.

233
00:28:55,315 --> 00:28:57,443
You're saying Jean created it?

234
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,111
No. I'm saying something else did.

235
00:28:59,277 --> 00:29:00,904
Maybe she was reacting to it.
I don't know.

236
00:29:01,071 --> 00:29:02,948
But the epicenter was
halfway around the world.

237
00:29:03,114 --> 00:29:04,240
Halfway around the world?

238
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:05,659
That's why I was hoping you could
take a look.

239
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:08,161
Let's see what we can find.

240
00:29:10,664 --> 00:29:12,132
Welcome, Professor.

241
00:29:22,926 --> 00:29:24,849
Okay, the source came from Cairo.

242
00:29:27,013 --> 00:29:28,356
I'll put in the coordinates.

243
00:29:53,206 --> 00:29:54,708
I gotta get out of here.

244
00:29:55,542 --> 00:29:56,543
Give them a report.

245
00:29:59,212 --> 00:30:00,304
What? What is it?

246
00:30:00,463 --> 00:30:03,888
Something happened here.
I can tell them it's real.

247
00:30:05,385 --> 00:30:06,386
It's her.

248
00:30:06,970 --> 00:30:07,721
Who?

249
00:30:09,222 --> 00:30:10,519
- Moira.
- What?

250
00:30:10,682 --> 00:30:11,899
Moira MacTaggert?

251
00:30:12,684 --> 00:30:14,231
Give me the details.

252
00:30:14,394 --> 00:30:16,317
She looks amazing.
She's barely aged a day.

253
00:30:16,646 --> 00:30:18,068
No. I meant...

254
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:19,691
What is she doing there?

255
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:21,075
What does the CIA want with this?

256
00:30:21,568 --> 00:30:24,572
She's going back to Langley
to deliver a report.

257
00:30:25,405 --> 00:30:26,406
I'm going to go there...

258
00:30:26,573 --> 00:30:28,917
see if she knows something
about the tremor.

259
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:30,247
And you want to go see Moira.

260
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:32,545
I want to go check her out. Check out...

261
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,830
the situation.

262
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:38,585
Moira MacTaggert.

263
00:30:41,379 --> 00:30:43,097
It's like a ghost from the past.

264
00:30:46,217 --> 00:30:47,594
You did a good thing. You saved that man.

265
00:30:47,927 --> 00:30:49,099
That's not the point.

266
00:30:49,888 --> 00:30:51,060
If I'm exposed, we're all exposed.

267
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:52,432
We have to go.

268
00:30:53,933 --> 00:30:55,401
This is our home.

269
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,278
This is our daughter's home.

270
00:30:57,437 --> 00:30:59,360
We are her home.

271
00:31:01,024 --> 00:31:03,948
I told you who I was,
the first night I met you.

272
00:31:04,444 --> 00:31:06,117
I trusted you then.

273
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,281
I need you to trust me now.

274
00:31:09,366 --> 00:31:11,460
We can't stay here anymore.

275
00:31:16,456 --> 00:31:17,423
I'll get Nina.

276
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:21,545
Sweetheart.

277
00:31:32,472 --> 00:31:34,065
She's not in her room.

278
00:31:34,224 --> 00:31:35,646
And I don't see her out back.

279
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:44,822
Nina?

280
00:31:44,984 --> 00:31:46,236
Nina!

281
00:31:46,486 --> 00:31:48,412
Nina!

282
00:31:54,285 --> 00:31:55,662
Nina!

283
00:32:16,975 --> 00:32:18,022
Nina.

284
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:19,694
Are you alright?

285
00:32:19,978 --> 00:32:21,230
She's fine.

286
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:22,564
Then let her go!

287
00:32:22,647 --> 00:32:23,819
We will.

288
00:32:24,649 --> 00:32:26,868
We just wanted to have a word

289
00:32:29,612 --> 00:32:31,865
You're not wearing your badges.

290
00:32:32,323 --> 00:32:34,325
No metal.

291
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,834
Some guys at the factory said
they saw something today.

292
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,457
Something that didn't add up.

293
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:42,133
Put your weapons away.

294
00:32:42,208 --> 00:32:44,631
You've been a good citizen, Henryk...

295
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:47,051
A good neighbor... a good worker.

296
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,132
I want to believe that's who you are.

297
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:50,307
It is.

298
00:32:50,383 --> 00:32:53,136
But nobody in this town really knows you.

299
00:32:53,219 --> 00:32:54,766
Yes you do.

300
00:32:55,555 --> 00:32:57,432
I am Henryk Gurzsky.

301
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,018
Jakob, I've had dinner in your home...

302
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,191
And you were lying the whole time.

303
00:33:02,437 --> 00:33:04,610
I brought a killer into my house.

304
00:33:06,858 --> 00:33:09,327
Is this you?

305
00:33:13,114 --> 00:33:16,038
Are you the one they call Magneto?

306
00:33:36,304 --> 00:33:38,477
Take me in.

307
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:39,769
Please...

308
00:33:39,849 --> 00:33:42,523
Just let my daughter go.

309
00:33:52,362 --> 00:33:53,830
Go with your mother.

310
00:34:02,205 --> 00:34:03,422
Please...

311
00:34:04,582 --> 00:34:06,334
Don't leave me.

312
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:09,421
I'm not going to let them take you.

313
00:34:09,754 --> 00:34:10,755
Nina.

314
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:13,884
Nina.

315
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:15,802
Nina.

316
00:34:16,886 --> 00:34:17,808
What's going on?

317
00:34:18,471 --> 00:34:19,438
She's one of them?

318
00:34:21,849 --> 00:34:22,816
Tell her to stop!

319
00:34:22,892 --> 00:34:24,519
She can't control it!

320
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:26,939
She's scared of you!

321
00:34:27,272 --> 00:34:29,149
I'm not going to let them take you!

322
00:34:36,447 --> 00:34:37,573
Make her stop!

323
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:41,036
Nina! Nina!

324
00:35:02,765 --> 00:35:03,516
Nina.

325
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,606
Nina, Nina, no...

326
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:07,896
No, please. Please!

327
00:35:10,773 --> 00:35:11,774
Please.

328
00:35:12,483 --> 00:35:13,700
Please.

329
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:23,502
Not my babies.

330
00:35:28,791 --> 00:35:30,589
Not my babies.

331
00:36:13,336 --> 00:36:15,054
Is this what you want from me?

332
00:36:17,965 --> 00:36:19,433
Is this what I am?

333
00:36:27,016 --> 00:36:28,563
Is this what I am?

334
00:37:44,469 --> 00:37:46,346
You know what we do to thieves.

335
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:48,223
Pick a hand.

336
00:37:48,389 --> 00:37:49,515
Enough.

337
00:37:52,351 --> 00:37:54,353
If you're with her, I suggest you walk away.

338
00:37:54,604 --> 00:37:55,981
While you still can.

339
00:37:58,691 --> 00:37:59,658
Walk away

340
00:38:01,194 --> 00:38:05,040
Who rules this world?

341
00:38:05,615 --> 00:38:07,333
What language is that?

342
00:38:09,952 --> 00:38:12,375
Clown-face. What's the deal?

343
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:13,581
Beat it!

344
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:30,724
I'm sorry.

345
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:40,067
You can't feel it, can you?

346
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:55,123
Now you feel it.

347
00:39:04,549 --> 00:39:06,392
So you really haven't seen her
in all these years?

348
00:39:06,551 --> 00:39:08,895
You never looked her up?
Not even in Cerebro?

349
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:12,186
Alex! What do you take me for,
some kind of pervert?

350
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:14,191
Yes, I looked her up once. Twice.

351
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,943
But not in a long time, all right?

352
00:39:16,102 --> 00:39:18,321
How did you leave things?
Any hard feelings?

353
00:39:18,813 --> 00:39:19,814
Not likely.

354
00:39:19,981 --> 00:39:21,574
Everybody take a break.

355
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:25,869
I wiped her mind of all memories of us.

356
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:27,951
The beach, Cuba...

357
00:39:28,114 --> 00:39:29,832
that whole time.

358
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:31,334
It was so long ago, Alex.

359
00:39:31,492 --> 00:39:33,085
Before the world knew about mutants.

360
00:39:33,244 --> 00:39:36,214
I felt it was the best thing for her.

361
00:39:36,789 --> 00:39:38,587
And for you?

362
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,088
Didn't really matter what was best for me.

363
00:39:46,424 --> 00:39:48,097
Moira...

364
00:39:48,259 --> 00:39:49,977
MacTaggert, hello!

365
00:39:54,807 --> 00:39:56,150
Allow me to introduce myself.

366
00:39:56,309 --> 00:39:58,107
- I'm Professor...
- Charles Xavier.

367
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:00,488
- I know exactly who you are.
- You do?

368
00:40:00,646 --> 00:40:01,647
Of course I do.

369
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:04,818
I have read all of your papers.

370
00:40:04,984 --> 00:40:06,986
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

371
00:40:08,154 --> 00:40:09,121
Moira MacTaggert.

372
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,452
- Alex Summers.
- Have a seat.

373
00:40:10,615 --> 00:40:12,288
Just throw that on the floor.

374
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,377
It's wonderful to see you again.

375
00:40:15,536 --> 00:40:17,664
To meet you again, for the first time.

376
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:18,831
You've got a son?

377
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:22,335
Yes.

378
00:40:22,501 --> 00:40:23,753
Does he have a husband?

379
00:40:25,963 --> 00:40:27,306
Do you have a husband?

380
00:40:27,465 --> 00:40:29,433
I had a husband...

381
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:32,015
but it's hard to do this job
and make it home in time for dinner.

382
00:40:32,178 --> 00:40:33,020
Good, good.

383
00:40:33,179 --> 00:40:34,601
We all make choices, right?

384
00:40:35,181 --> 00:40:37,104
Yes, we do.

385
00:40:39,185 --> 00:40:41,358
- Professor.
- Yes?

386
00:40:42,313 --> 00:40:43,280
Yes.

387
00:40:43,522 --> 00:40:46,025
I was, we were hoping that you would...

388
00:40:46,192 --> 00:40:48,320
tell us about what happened
yesterday in Egypt.

389
00:40:49,028 --> 00:40:51,122
I'm afraid that's classified information.

390
00:40:52,365 --> 00:40:54,367
I don't mean to be rude...

391
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:56,539
but how did you get in here?

392
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,871
I have level-five clearance.

393
00:41:01,332 --> 00:41:04,211
Ever since the world found out
about mutants in '73...

394
00:41:04,377 --> 00:41:07,221
there have been cults
who see them as some kind of...

395
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,382
Second Coming or sign of God.

396
00:41:09,548 --> 00:41:10,845
I was tracking one of them.

397
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:15,054
They call themselves Ashir En Sabah Nur...

398
00:41:15,221 --> 00:41:18,395
named after an ancient being
they believe to be the world's first.

399
00:41:18,557 --> 00:41:19,854
The world's first what?

400
00:41:20,017 --> 00:41:21,394
The world's first mutant.

401
00:41:21,727 --> 00:41:24,321
I thought mutants didn't evolve
until this century.

402
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,824
That's the common theory, yes,
but these guys believe...

403
00:41:26,983 --> 00:41:30,328
that the first mutant was born
tens of thousands of years ago.

404
00:41:30,486 --> 00:41:31,703
And they believe he will rise again.

405
00:41:31,862 --> 00:41:35,241
They've been searching ancient sites
all around the world for clues.

406
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:37,747
These hieroglyphs...

407
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:41,881
describe a specific set of powers
greater than any man could possess.

408
00:41:42,039 --> 00:41:43,541
They think he lived all that time?

409
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,507
Yes and no.
They believe he had the ability...

410
00:41:46,669 --> 00:41:48,171
to transfer his consciousness
from body to body.

411
00:41:48,337 --> 00:41:49,759
And whenever he was close to death...

412
00:41:49,922 --> 00:41:51,344
he would just take on a new body.

413
00:41:51,507 --> 00:41:53,509
Some of these may have been
the bodies of mutants...

414
00:41:53,676 --> 00:41:55,428
enabling him to take their powers...

415
00:41:55,594 --> 00:41:57,437
amassing various abilities over the years.

416
00:41:57,596 --> 00:42:00,270
- An all-powerful mutant.
- Exactly.

417
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:03,232
And wherever this being was
he always had four...

418
00:42:03,394 --> 00:42:06,238
principle followers. Disciples.

419
00:42:06,397 --> 00:42:08,274
Protectors he would imbue with powers.

420
00:42:08,441 --> 00:42:09,567
Like the Four Horsemen...

421
00:42:10,276 --> 00:42:11,949
of the Apocalypse.

422
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:13,704
He got that one from the Bible.

423
00:42:13,863 --> 00:42:15,615
Or the Bible got it from him.

424
00:42:16,282 --> 00:42:17,909
And wherever he ruled...

425
00:42:18,075 --> 00:42:20,954
eventually, it would end in disaster.

426
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,417
Cataclysm.

427
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,628
Some kind of...

428
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,258
Apocalypse

429
00:42:27,293 --> 00:42:29,045
The end of the world.

430
00:42:30,755 --> 00:42:32,632
I must say, Apollo...

431
00:42:33,632 --> 00:42:36,135
the way you ape human behavior
is remarkable.

432
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:43,688
I am Apollo.

433
00:42:43,768 --> 00:42:46,772
I've never seen another
mutant in this town.

434
00:42:47,063 --> 00:42:48,531
You speak Egyptian?

435
00:42:48,689 --> 00:42:49,406
Arabic?

436
00:42:50,149 --> 00:42:51,275
English?

437
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:52,989
I'm a scientist.

438
00:42:53,152 --> 00:42:54,495
My particular specialty...

439
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:55,654
Great fighter.

440
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,912
She's my hero.

441
00:42:59,075 --> 00:43:00,952
I want to be like her.

442
00:43:03,496 --> 00:43:06,500
There's some food here. Not much.

443
00:43:06,665 --> 00:43:07,757
I don't believe it.

444
00:43:07,917 --> 00:43:09,294
You love me.

445
00:43:10,169 --> 00:43:11,170
Love you?

446
00:43:12,004 --> 00:43:12,755
Illogical.

447
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,843
I'm not some simple shepherdess
you can awe.

448
00:43:18,177 --> 00:43:20,475
Why, I could no more love you...

449
00:43:20,638 --> 00:43:23,608
than I could love a new species
of bacteria.

450
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:26,277
What are you doing?

451
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:30,360
Learning.

452
00:43:38,197 --> 00:43:41,622
In the streets, there is outrage against
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan...

453
00:43:42,118 --> 00:43:43,119
...in a brotherhood of our kind.

454
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:44,207
Several demonstrations.

455
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:48,792
One of them was held in Boston,
and Bruce Morton has the story.

456
00:43:48,958 --> 00:43:52,838
Since the advent of nuclear weapons,
the United States does not start fights.

457
00:43:53,462 --> 00:43:54,714
Weapons.

458
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,633
Never before has man
possessed so much power.

459
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:00,223
Soviet Union and United States
being superpowers...

460
00:44:01,971 --> 00:44:04,815
Superpowers.

461
00:44:05,683 --> 00:44:07,401
The weak...

462
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,733
have taken the earth.

463
00:44:10,396 --> 00:44:13,445
For this, I was betrayed.

464
00:44:13,816 --> 00:44:16,160
False gods.

465
00:44:17,153 --> 00:44:18,075
Idols.

466
00:44:19,905 --> 00:44:22,624
No more.

467
00:44:25,411 --> 00:44:29,416
I have returned.

468
00:44:30,124 --> 00:44:32,218
A new tomorrow...

469
00:44:32,376 --> 00:44:33,923
that starts today.

470
00:44:38,924 --> 00:44:40,642
Where did you come from?

471
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:50,770
A time before man lost his way.

472
00:44:53,856 --> 00:44:55,779
Welcome to the '80s.

473
00:44:55,983 --> 00:44:58,782
This world needs to be...

474
00:45:00,446 --> 00:45:02,198
Cleansed.

475
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:03,957
What?

476
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:06,411
Saved.

477
00:45:08,329 --> 00:45:10,457
You can't save the world...

478
00:45:10,623 --> 00:45:12,591
just going around killing people.

479
00:45:12,750 --> 00:45:14,423
There's laws, systems in place...

480
00:45:14,585 --> 00:45:15,711
for that kind of thing.

481
00:45:18,631 --> 00:45:19,848
My child...

482
00:45:20,007 --> 00:45:22,635
why do you enslave yourself?

483
00:45:27,348 --> 00:45:29,066
What are you doing?

484
00:45:29,225 --> 00:45:30,818
Making you stronger.

485
00:45:32,186 --> 00:45:34,109
My goddess.

486
00:45:40,903 --> 00:45:41,950
Aphrodite.

487
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,247
You were right.

488
00:45:44,406 --> 00:45:45,578
Yes.

489
00:45:49,286 --> 00:45:50,754
You were right.

490
00:45:51,413 --> 00:45:53,290
The time is past.

491
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:56,339
There is no room for gods.

492
00:46:00,881 --> 00:46:02,383
Why can't I go with you?

493
00:46:02,549 --> 00:46:04,176
I told you, I work alone.

494
00:46:11,267 --> 00:46:12,564
Wait there.

495
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:16,030
Always good to see your face.

496
00:46:16,188 --> 00:46:17,235
Even if it's not yours.

497
00:46:18,399 --> 00:46:19,616
Papers and passage for one.

498
00:46:21,986 --> 00:46:24,330
Where's the gentleman going, if I may ask?

499
00:46:24,488 --> 00:46:25,614
Don't know, don't care.

500
00:46:26,573 --> 00:46:28,371
I just save his life.
What he does with it is up to him.

501
00:46:28,951 --> 00:46:31,454
Mystique, the mercenary.

502
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,872
Don't call me that.

503
00:46:33,038 --> 00:46:34,381
No matter how much you pretend
to be someone else...

504
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:36,008
Caliban knows who you are.

505
00:46:36,166 --> 00:46:38,339
If there's anything worth knowing
about mutants...

506
00:46:38,502 --> 00:46:40,004
Caliban knows it.

507
00:46:40,504 --> 00:46:41,551
Mystique.

508
00:46:42,256 --> 00:46:45,392
Why don't you ask your psychics what'll
happen to you if you keep pushing me?

509
00:46:45,551 --> 00:46:46,393
What'll happen?

510
00:46:50,848 --> 00:46:52,646
Psylocke gets a little jealous.

511
00:46:54,810 --> 00:46:56,062
But Caliban likes you.

512
00:46:56,228 --> 00:46:57,480
Caliban likes money.

513
00:46:57,646 --> 00:46:59,523
Caliban likes you so much...

514
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:01,863
he wants to give you free information...

515
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:03,994
about an old friend...

516
00:47:04,153 --> 00:47:05,621
from back when you had friends.

517
00:47:06,155 --> 00:47:08,624
Do you remember...

518
00:47:08,782 --> 00:47:10,830
Erik Lehnsherr?

519
00:47:11,118 --> 00:47:13,120
My girls got a flash of him in Poland.

520
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:15,255
He left quite a few dead bodies
in his wake...

521
00:47:15,581 --> 00:47:18,300
including his wife and daughter.

522
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:23,589
Should be in the news soon enough
but Caliban gives you a little head start.

523
00:47:25,466 --> 00:47:27,434
- How fast are you?
- How fast?

524
00:47:27,593 --> 00:47:29,140
How far can you cover?

525
00:47:29,303 --> 00:47:30,976
As far as I can see
or if I've been there before.

526
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:32,481
Come with me, Crawler.

527
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:34,107
Actually, it's Nightcrawler.

528
00:47:34,266 --> 00:47:36,189
And my real name is...

529
00:47:37,561 --> 00:47:39,359
Kurt Wagner.

530
00:47:43,525 --> 00:47:46,119
The lenses are made of
some ruby quartz I had lying around.

531
00:47:46,278 --> 00:47:48,030
They should be able to
refract your optic beams...

532
00:47:48,197 --> 00:47:49,915
and keep them contained
within their own vector fields.

533
00:47:50,407 --> 00:47:51,624
Try them on.

534
00:48:06,256 --> 00:48:06,973
Okay.

535
00:48:07,132 --> 00:48:09,100
Go ahead.

536
00:48:09,968 --> 00:48:11,970
Wait, sorry, no.

537
00:48:12,137 --> 00:48:13,013
Okay.

538
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,102
- Now?
- Yeah, you're good.

539
00:48:14,264 --> 00:48:15,265
All right.

540
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:20,354
Whoa.

541
00:48:21,814 --> 00:48:23,361
I can see.

542
00:48:23,524 --> 00:48:24,741
Thank you.

543
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,027
Professor, thank you. You're a genius.

544
00:48:27,194 --> 00:48:28,161
No.

545
00:48:28,612 --> 00:48:31,035
I'm not a professor. I wish...

546
00:48:32,825 --> 00:48:33,826
Who's that?

547
00:48:36,662 --> 00:48:38,335
I believe you two met. That's Jean Grey.

548
00:48:38,497 --> 00:48:39,749
You bumped into her when you arrived.

549
00:48:39,915 --> 00:48:41,838
- Wait, that's her?
- Yeah.

550
00:48:47,256 --> 00:48:48,098
Hey.

551
00:48:51,135 --> 00:48:52,261
You can see.

552
00:48:53,679 --> 00:48:56,023
Yeah. It's not as bad as I thought here.

553
00:48:56,181 --> 00:48:57,148
Freak.

554
00:48:57,307 --> 00:48:58,650
- Someone should warn the new kid.
- Yeah. Someone should tell him.

555
00:48:58,809 --> 00:49:00,106
They're still scared of me.

556
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,362
Hey, I have special glasses now.

557
00:49:02,521 --> 00:49:03,818
They're not scared of you.

558
00:49:03,981 --> 00:49:05,699
They're scared of me.

559
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:09,620
You're not the only one who
can't fully control your powers.

560
00:49:10,612 --> 00:49:11,613
Wait, so...

561
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,533
last night, when the house shook...

562
00:49:15,033 --> 00:49:16,034
that was you?

563
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:18,704
Sorry to break it to you, but you're not
the biggest freak in the school.

564
00:49:19,788 --> 00:49:21,631
Well, that's a first.

565
00:49:35,512 --> 00:49:36,855
Raven.

566
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:42,311
Wow.

567
00:49:43,645 --> 00:49:45,397
I... You're...

568
00:49:45,564 --> 00:49:46,736
Not blue?

569
00:49:46,899 --> 00:49:48,822
Looks like you and I
have that in common, now.

570
00:49:48,984 --> 00:49:51,078
No, no, I meant...

571
00:49:52,988 --> 00:49:54,205
you're back.

572
00:49:55,824 --> 00:49:57,747
Never thought I'd see you here again.

573
00:49:59,077 --> 00:50:00,499
Yeah, me neither.

574
00:50:03,832 --> 00:50:05,209
I'm blue.

575
00:50:05,667 --> 00:50:06,839
I'm Kurt.

576
00:50:07,002 --> 00:50:08,254
Oh, right.

577
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:09,588
Kurt Wagner.

578
00:50:10,589 --> 00:50:11,431
Welcome.

579
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:16,353
We're closed.

580
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,892
I knew I felt a chill in the air.

581
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:25,942
How did you get in here?

582
00:50:26,104 --> 00:50:27,105
We let ourselves in.

583
00:50:27,272 --> 00:50:28,774
We are looking for mutants.

584
00:50:28,941 --> 00:50:32,036
Since you know where to find them,
we came here.

585
00:50:32,194 --> 00:50:33,571
Caliban doesn't know you.

586
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:37,408
We're looking for the strongest.

587
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:43,080
Everything all right?

588
00:50:43,247 --> 00:50:44,464
I'm fine, Psylocke.

589
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:46,967
How much money do you have?

590
00:50:47,459 --> 00:50:48,301
None.

591
00:50:49,628 --> 00:50:51,630
Like Caliban said...

592
00:50:51,797 --> 00:50:53,470
we are closed. Yeah?

593
00:50:55,092 --> 00:50:57,470
I need your help, my child.

594
00:50:58,428 --> 00:51:00,101
You don't look like Caliban's father.

595
00:51:00,806 --> 00:51:02,479
Maybe a little bit up here.

596
00:51:10,566 --> 00:51:12,443
You are all my children...

597
00:51:12,609 --> 00:51:15,954
and you're lost, because you follow
blind leaders.

598
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,124
These false gods...

599
00:51:19,491 --> 00:51:21,994
systems of the weak.

600
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:24,671
They've ruined my world...

601
00:51:25,163 --> 00:51:26,130
No more.

602
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,683
What do you want?

603
00:51:46,518 --> 00:51:48,020
I want you...

604
00:51:48,645 --> 00:51:51,489
to feel the full reach of your power.

605
00:51:57,487 --> 00:52:00,616
You've only had a taste
of your true strength.

606
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:02,034
Unlike others...

607
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,544
who seek to control you...

608
00:52:05,037 --> 00:52:07,381
I want to set you free.

609
00:52:17,299 --> 00:52:19,518
I know the kind of mutants
you're looking for.

610
00:52:21,720 --> 00:52:24,064
And I know where to find them.

611
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:29,311
It's my first time in America.

612
00:52:29,478 --> 00:52:31,355
I'm very excited to see your culture.

613
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:33,194
Well, you're not gonna see it here.

614
00:52:33,357 --> 00:52:36,076
The only thing American about this place
is that it used to be British.

615
00:52:36,693 --> 00:52:37,740
This is Scott.

616
00:52:38,862 --> 00:52:40,239
He's new here, too.

617
00:52:40,405 --> 00:52:41,907
And I'm already up for a prison break.

618
00:52:44,242 --> 00:52:46,665
What do we say, we take this blue guy
on a little field trip?

619
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:48,671
I'm sure there's a
mall around here, somewhere.

620
00:52:49,247 --> 00:52:50,419
What's a mall?

621
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,584
What's a mall?

622
00:52:52,751 --> 00:52:55,595
All right, now this is a matter of
national pride. Civic duty.

623
00:52:55,754 --> 00:52:56,846
Scott.

624
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,933
What? You've been cooped up here
for a long time...

625
00:53:00,258 --> 00:53:02,431
and the Professor's not even home.

626
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,597
I'd like to go to the mall.

627
00:53:06,932 --> 00:53:08,104
Try it.

628
00:53:08,266 --> 00:53:09,062
All right.

629
00:53:10,018 --> 00:53:11,440
Where does he keep his cars?

630
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:28,412
Or should I say "piss off"?

631
00:53:33,792 --> 00:53:34,964
This is the guy?

632
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:36,632
He used to be.

633
00:53:36,795 --> 00:53:38,889
I didn't know his wings were...

634
00:53:42,884 --> 00:53:44,136
Let's get out of here.

635
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:45,725
His fighting days are done.

636
00:53:46,555 --> 00:53:48,228
No, they're not.

637
00:53:53,937 --> 00:53:55,154
What the hell is this?

638
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,993
I want to give you something.

639
00:54:00,318 --> 00:54:02,662
There's nothing you can give me
that I want.

640
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:05,499
Yes, there is.

641
00:54:20,297 --> 00:54:22,299
Yes, my son.

642
00:54:36,104 --> 00:54:37,356
Yes.

643
00:54:49,034 --> 00:54:52,038
Rise, my angel.

644
00:54:54,873 --> 00:54:56,045
Rise.

645
00:55:25,946 --> 00:55:26,947
Wow.

646
00:55:29,074 --> 00:55:32,920
Hypersonic, blast resistant,
stealth technology.

647
00:55:33,078 --> 00:55:34,375
That's impressive.

648
00:55:34,871 --> 00:55:37,215
How are you ever gonna get it out of here?

649
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:39,584
Well, that's okay.

650
00:55:39,751 --> 00:55:41,628
I built a retractable roof
into the basketball court.

651
00:55:43,213 --> 00:55:45,307
Hank, you're building a warplane
down here.

652
00:55:46,216 --> 00:55:48,810
After what happened in Washington,
I thought we were going to come back...

653
00:55:48,969 --> 00:55:51,063
and start the X-Men,
like we all used to talk about.

654
00:55:51,221 --> 00:55:52,473
But...

655
00:55:52,639 --> 00:55:54,607
Charles wants students, not soldiers.

656
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:56,647
And he thinks the best of people.

657
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:57,902
He has hope.

658
00:55:58,270 --> 00:55:59,442
And you?

659
00:56:00,772 --> 00:56:02,740
You know, I think we should
hope for the best.

660
00:56:02,899 --> 00:56:05,322
And prepare for the worst.

661
00:56:06,111 --> 00:56:07,658
I think the world needs the X-Men.

662
00:56:08,989 --> 00:56:12,584
And maybe now that you're back,
you could help me convince him.

663
00:56:12,742 --> 00:56:13,743
We could start it together.

664
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,162
Hank, I'm here about Erik.

665
00:56:16,788 --> 00:56:18,415
Right. Erik.

666
00:56:18,582 --> 00:56:19,834
Yeah. Of course.

667
00:56:20,584 --> 00:56:21,426
Of course.

668
00:56:21,585 --> 00:56:22,962
I think he might be
in some kind of trouble.

669
00:56:23,670 --> 00:56:24,967
Real trouble.

670
00:56:26,631 --> 00:56:28,099
Isn't he always?

671
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:04,135
Some of you spoke to the police...

672
00:57:04,878 --> 00:57:08,428
about what you believe
you witnessed here yesterday.

673
00:57:11,134 --> 00:57:12,807
You want to know my powers...

674
00:57:14,554 --> 00:57:16,056
know who I am...

675
00:57:17,807 --> 00:57:19,650
see what I can do?

676
00:57:21,895 --> 00:57:23,363
I'll show you.

677
00:57:26,066 --> 00:57:29,036
Think of the person you love most
in your life.

678
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:32,656
Your wife.

679
00:57:35,492 --> 00:57:36,744
Mother.

680
00:57:39,871 --> 00:57:41,339
Daughter.

681
00:57:45,919 --> 00:57:49,298
Now that person will know what it is
to lose someone they love.

682
00:57:50,298 --> 00:57:52,847
And live with that pain.

683
00:57:54,094 --> 00:57:55,095
Forever.

684
00:57:55,178 --> 00:57:56,725
Henryk, please.

685
00:57:56,930 --> 00:57:58,056
Don't do this.

686
00:57:59,516 --> 00:58:01,234
My name isn't Henryk.

687
00:58:05,313 --> 00:58:07,941
My name is Magneto.

688
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,922
Who the fuck are you?

689
00:58:32,716 --> 00:58:34,434
Stay back.

690
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:37,262
Whoever you are...

691
00:58:38,388 --> 00:58:40,561
don't try to stop me
from killing these men.

692
00:59:00,035 --> 00:59:01,787
I'm not here for them.

693
00:59:03,788 --> 00:59:05,335
I'm here for you.

694
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:24,272
Come and see.

695
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:00,178
This is where your power was born.

696
01:00:02,722 --> 01:00:05,145
And this is where
your people were slaughtered.

697
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:22,868
You shouldn't have brought me here.

698
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:26,412
Why?

699
01:00:28,748 --> 01:00:30,876
Are you afraid to be here?

700
01:00:32,502 --> 01:00:35,301
You can't escape it, Erik.

701
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:39,050
Who are you?

702
01:00:39,217 --> 01:00:42,437
Elohim, Shen, Ra.

703
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:46,475
I've been called many names
over many lifetimes.

704
01:00:47,642 --> 01:00:50,111
I am born of death.

705
01:00:50,520 --> 01:00:51,988
I was there to spark...

706
01:00:52,147 --> 01:00:55,117
and fan the flame of man's awakening.

707
01:00:55,275 --> 01:00:57,698
To spin the wheel of civilization.

708
01:00:57,861 --> 01:00:59,454
And when the forest would grow rank...

709
01:00:59,612 --> 01:01:01,785
and needed clearing for new growth...

710
01:01:02,824 --> 01:01:06,169
I was there to set it ablaze.

711
01:01:07,579 --> 01:01:09,081
Where were you...

712
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,716
when my father and mother
were slaughtered in this place?

713
01:01:11,875 --> 01:01:12,876
Asleep.

714
01:01:13,459 --> 01:01:15,678
Trapped in darkness.

715
01:01:16,171 --> 01:01:18,139
I was not there for you, my son.

716
01:01:18,298 --> 01:01:20,551
But I am here now.

717
01:01:20,717 --> 01:01:24,392
You don't know your own strength,
but I do.

718
01:01:27,432 --> 01:01:29,230
Reach down.

719
01:01:29,684 --> 01:01:31,106
Feel the metal...

720
01:01:31,269 --> 01:01:33,112
in the ground.

721
01:01:33,271 --> 01:01:36,275
Reach as deep as you can.

722
01:01:39,277 --> 01:01:41,530
You'll find you have the power...

723
01:01:41,696 --> 01:01:44,575
to move the very Earth itself.

724
01:02:17,607 --> 01:02:21,737
Everything they've built will fall!

725
01:02:23,947 --> 01:02:26,621
And from the ashes of their world...

726
01:02:27,951 --> 01:02:31,455
we'll build a better one!

727
01:02:57,981 --> 01:03:01,827
Lehnsherr was identified yesterday,
in this small town in central Poland.

728
01:03:02,402 --> 01:03:06,327
Leaders from all communities are urging
their citizens to remain calm.

729
01:03:06,489 --> 01:03:09,834
As police and armed forces
are mobilizing to find Lehnsherr...

730
01:03:09,909 --> 01:03:11,252
...before he can strike again.

731
01:03:11,411 --> 01:03:14,506
If anyone has information
about Lehnsherr...

732
01:03:14,664 --> 01:03:16,632
or as he is also known, Magneto...

733
01:03:16,791 --> 01:03:19,294
contact your local authorities
immediately...

734
01:03:19,460 --> 01:03:21,383
and proceed with caution...

735
01:03:21,546 --> 01:03:23,969
- as he is considered extremely...
- Peter.

736
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:25,633
What's up?

737
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:30,309
Just checking on you.

738
01:03:30,471 --> 01:03:32,064
I'm good. Playing Pac-Man.

739
01:03:38,104 --> 01:03:39,401
You sure you weren't watching this?

740
01:03:39,564 --> 01:03:41,441
This news comes at a time when the world
is celebrating 10 years of peace...

741
01:03:41,607 --> 01:03:43,701
between mutants and mankind.

742
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,612
You're going after him, aren't you?

743
01:03:47,322 --> 01:03:49,416
You wanted me
to get out of the house more, right?

744
01:03:50,241 --> 01:03:52,960
I can't stop you. Nobody can.

745
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:55,121
But trust me, this won't end well.

746
01:03:56,289 --> 01:03:57,882
Nothing does with him.

747
01:04:01,711 --> 01:04:03,088
I'm not afraid of him.

748
01:04:03,463 --> 01:04:05,386
You should be.

749
01:04:31,324 --> 01:04:33,418
I've read so much about this place.

750
01:04:34,827 --> 01:04:37,125
But being here,
it actually seems kind of...

751
01:04:37,789 --> 01:04:39,382
familiar.

752
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:40,541
Strange.

753
01:04:40,708 --> 01:04:41,834
Quite.

754
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:43,127
Shall we?

755
01:04:45,046 --> 01:04:46,844
I'm just saying, Empire is still the best.

756
01:04:47,006 --> 01:04:49,555
It's the most complex,
the most sophisticated...

757
01:04:49,717 --> 01:04:51,060
wasn't afraid to have a dark ending.

758
01:04:51,219 --> 01:04:52,721
Yeah, but come on.
If it wasn't for the first one...

759
01:04:52,887 --> 01:04:54,389
you wouldn't have any of the rest
of the movies.

760
01:04:54,555 --> 01:04:58,059
Well, at least we can all agree,
the third one's always the worst.

761
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,478
Hank. Are you in here?

762
01:05:00,645 --> 01:05:02,238
I'd like you to meet...

763
01:05:04,273 --> 01:05:05,399
Moira.

764
01:05:05,566 --> 01:05:07,068
Raven.

765
01:05:07,276 --> 01:05:08,903
I'm sorry, have we met?

766
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:14,833
Hank, Alex, Agent MacTaggert,
would you give us just one moment, please?

767
01:05:16,411 --> 01:05:17,253
Of course.

768
01:05:21,290 --> 01:05:23,759
Charles, why didn't she recognize me?
She knew me in this form.

769
01:05:23,918 --> 01:05:26,637
Well, after you
left me on the beach in Cuba...

770
01:05:26,796 --> 01:05:29,470
I took her memories of that time.
Have a seat.

771
01:05:30,341 --> 01:05:32,014
Lucky girl.

772
01:05:35,012 --> 01:05:36,685
It's good to see you, Raven.

773
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:39,142
- Welcome home.
- This isn't my home.

774
01:05:40,685 --> 01:05:41,777
It was once.

775
01:05:41,936 --> 01:05:43,779
No, it was your home. I just lived here.

776
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,278
And I barely even recognize it now.

777
01:05:46,441 --> 01:05:48,239
You know, I have plans for this place.

778
01:05:49,485 --> 01:05:51,203
I mean to turn it into a real campus.

779
01:05:51,362 --> 01:05:52,454
A university.

780
01:05:52,613 --> 01:05:55,457
Not just for mutants, either,
for humans too.

781
01:05:56,367 --> 01:05:57,994
Living and working...

782
01:05:58,744 --> 01:06:00,712
growing together.

783
01:06:01,164 --> 01:06:02,882
You know, I really believed that once.

784
01:06:03,040 --> 01:06:05,839
I really believed we
could change them after DC.

785
01:06:06,377 --> 01:06:07,378
We did.

786
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:09,513
No, Charles. They still hate and fear us.

787
01:06:09,672 --> 01:06:11,925
It's just harder to see
because they're more polite about it.

788
01:06:12,091 --> 01:06:13,343
I got sick of living that lie.

789
01:06:13,509 --> 01:06:16,558
That's why you're not in your
natural blue form.

790
01:06:16,721 --> 01:06:19,770
I'm not gonna be the face of a world
that doesn't exist.

791
01:06:20,516 --> 01:06:22,564
Things are better. The world is better.

792
01:06:22,727 --> 01:06:24,274
Maybe in Westchester.

793
01:06:25,188 --> 01:06:27,065
Out there, mutants are still running...

794
01:06:27,773 --> 01:06:29,366
hiding, living in fear.

795
01:06:29,525 --> 01:06:32,324
Just because there's not a war,
doesn't mean there's peace.

796
01:06:33,029 --> 01:06:34,702
You want to teach your kids something,
teach them that.

797
01:06:34,864 --> 01:06:36,411
Teach them to fight.

798
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:38,542
Otherwise they might as well live
in this house for the rest of their lives.

799
01:06:38,701 --> 01:06:40,874
You still sound just like him.

800
01:06:41,037 --> 01:06:42,710
You sound just like Erik.

801
01:06:44,957 --> 01:06:46,425
That's why I'm here.

802
01:06:47,251 --> 01:06:48,719
He's resurfaced.

803
01:06:51,214 --> 01:06:53,182
He had a wife and a child.

804
01:06:53,341 --> 01:06:54,558
They were killed.

805
01:06:55,343 --> 01:06:57,391
Along with a handful of policemen.

806
01:06:59,972 --> 01:07:02,600
The whole world will be looking for him.

807
01:07:02,767 --> 01:07:05,316
But you can help me find him
before they do.

808
01:07:13,945 --> 01:07:16,824
Moira, I'm going to have to ask you
to keep this a secret.

809
01:07:16,989 --> 01:07:20,038
I don't even know what this is.

810
01:07:20,201 --> 01:07:21,669
It's Cerebro.

811
01:07:21,827 --> 01:07:22,828
The new model.

812
01:07:22,995 --> 01:07:24,668
I based the color on...

813
01:07:26,958 --> 01:07:27,959
It doesn't matter.

814
01:07:45,893 --> 01:07:47,440
What are those?

815
01:07:47,603 --> 01:07:49,776
Those are all the humans of the world.

816
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:53,951
And these...

817
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,488
are all the mutants.

818
01:07:56,654 --> 01:07:58,156
I'm connected to all of their minds.

819
01:08:00,199 --> 01:08:02,122
The CIA would kill for this.

820
01:08:02,285 --> 01:08:03,912
I know they would.

821
01:08:06,539 --> 01:08:08,587
Where are you, Erik?

822
01:08:40,531 --> 01:08:41,532
Charles?

823
01:08:43,159 --> 01:08:44,081
Hello, old friend.

824
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:49,207
I'm sorry. I am so sorry!

825
01:08:49,373 --> 01:08:51,046
I feel your pain.

826
01:08:52,752 --> 01:08:54,345
And your loss.

827
01:08:55,713 --> 01:08:58,341
You think because you can
see into my head...

828
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:01,093
you know how it feels?

829
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:04,225
You're looking in the wrong place,
Charles.

830
01:09:04,513 --> 01:09:07,062
What happened to them,
it was terribly wrong.

831
01:09:08,976 --> 01:09:10,228
But come back to us.

832
01:09:10,394 --> 01:09:11,941
I can help you.

833
01:09:12,772 --> 01:09:14,490
Help me?

834
01:09:15,441 --> 01:09:16,784
Think of your wife,
think of your daughter.

835
01:09:16,942 --> 01:09:18,569
What would they have wanted?

836
01:09:18,736 --> 01:09:20,363
They would have wanted to live.

837
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,499
I tried your way, Charles.

838
01:09:24,492 --> 01:09:27,041
I tried to be like them.

839
01:09:27,953 --> 01:09:29,796
Live like them.

840
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:34,427
But it always ends the same way.

841
01:09:36,337 --> 01:09:38,760
They took everything away from me.

842
01:09:42,718 --> 01:09:43,890
Now...

843
01:09:47,515 --> 01:09:49,517
we'll take everything from them.

844
01:09:58,150 --> 01:09:59,151
Hank...

845
01:10:01,696 --> 01:10:03,448
he's not alone.

846
01:10:10,955 --> 01:10:12,377
Extraordinary.

847
01:10:14,041 --> 01:10:15,588
What do you see?

848
01:10:18,337 --> 01:10:20,089
The answer.

849
01:10:22,633 --> 01:10:23,930
Hey, Charles, wait.

850
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:38,691
Oh, my God.

851
01:10:39,191 --> 01:10:42,445
Thank you for letting me in.

852
01:10:47,783 --> 01:10:49,126
Charles, get out!

853
01:10:50,953 --> 01:10:54,127
I've never felt power like this before.

854
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,007
Charles...

855
01:10:55,166 --> 01:10:56,418
Charles, get out of there.

856
01:10:56,584 --> 01:10:58,177
What's going on? What's happening?

857
01:10:58,335 --> 01:10:59,177
I think...

858
01:11:00,171 --> 01:11:01,343
Someone's taken over Cerebro.

859
01:11:01,505 --> 01:11:03,428
- They've taken control of it.
- To do what?

860
01:11:05,259 --> 01:11:06,511
To connect.

861
01:11:15,811 --> 01:11:17,609
Always the same.

862
01:11:19,023 --> 01:11:21,697
And now, all this.

863
01:11:25,362 --> 01:11:27,330
No more stones.

864
01:11:30,618 --> 01:11:32,791
No more spears.

865
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,883
No more slings.

866
01:11:46,842 --> 01:11:49,891
No more swords.

867
01:11:50,054 --> 01:11:52,898
No more weapons!

868
01:11:53,516 --> 01:11:56,565
No more systems!

869
01:11:57,394 --> 01:11:59,897
No more!

870
01:12:00,564 --> 01:12:03,408
No more superpowers.

871
01:12:04,819 --> 01:12:05,991
Charles!

872
01:12:09,156 --> 01:12:10,248
Hank!

873
01:12:28,092 --> 01:12:29,560
What the hell is going on?

874
01:12:30,427 --> 01:12:32,020
Who's turning the keys?

875
01:12:32,763 --> 01:12:33,935
The men are.

876
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,687
Who green-lit the launch?

877
01:12:36,183 --> 01:12:38,106
Hank, do something!

878
01:12:42,773 --> 01:12:44,025
It won't shut down!

879
01:12:46,902 --> 01:12:49,405
We've lost contact
with all Trident and Polaris subs.

880
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,748
The Air Force is reporting the same thing.

881
01:12:51,907 --> 01:12:55,207
So much faith in their tools...

882
01:12:55,369 --> 01:12:58,043
and their machines.

883
01:12:58,205 --> 01:12:59,548
Russia, China...

884
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:02,426
England, Israel, India.

885
01:13:02,585 --> 01:13:04,462
Everybody's got nukes in the air.

886
01:13:04,628 --> 01:13:05,629
What's the target?

887
01:13:05,796 --> 01:13:06,888
Where are they going?

888
01:13:07,047 --> 01:13:08,924
Up, straight up.

889
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:09,808
Alex...

890
01:13:09,967 --> 01:13:11,264
- What?
- Destroy it!

891
01:13:11,427 --> 01:13:13,395
Destroy everything. Destroy Cerebro!

892
01:13:18,267 --> 01:13:19,393
Wreak havoc!

893
01:13:23,981 --> 01:13:26,655
You can fire your arrows...

894
01:13:26,817 --> 01:13:29,411
from the Tower of Babel...

895
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:42,500
but you can never strike God!

896
01:14:00,184 --> 01:14:02,278
Charles, are you okay?

897
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:21,292
Erik.

898
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:25,834
Charles!

899
01:14:27,336 --> 01:14:28,212
Alex!

900
01:14:29,129 --> 01:14:30,051
Hey!

901
01:14:30,214 --> 01:14:30,965
Hey, asshole!

902
01:14:31,131 --> 01:14:33,304
All will be revealed, my child.

903
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:34,184
Stop!

904
01:14:34,718 --> 01:14:35,514
No!

905
01:17:31,728 --> 01:17:32,729
Wow!

906
01:17:38,235 --> 01:17:39,737
Where did you...

907
01:17:39,903 --> 01:17:42,531
I was looking for the Professor.
I thought he lived here.

908
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:47,081
They took him.

909
01:17:48,412 --> 01:17:50,130
She's the one. It's her.

910
01:17:51,123 --> 01:17:52,249
Are you sure?

911
01:17:53,458 --> 01:17:54,459
Is she gonna help us?

912
01:18:04,094 --> 01:18:05,596
They look up to you.

913
01:18:09,683 --> 01:18:10,525
Right now...

914
01:18:11,518 --> 01:18:12,610
they need you.

915
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:18,113
That's not what they need.

916
01:18:20,277 --> 01:18:21,529
That's awesome!

917
01:18:29,786 --> 01:18:30,787
What happened?

918
01:18:30,954 --> 01:18:32,046
Where's Alex?

919
01:18:32,289 --> 01:18:33,290
Where's my brother?

920
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:35,585
Pretty sure I got everybody.

921
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:40,798
Alex was closest to the blast.

922
01:18:56,813 --> 01:18:57,814
Alex...

923
01:19:19,836 --> 01:19:21,008
We're one click out.

924
01:19:22,172 --> 01:19:23,765
All right, boys. This is it.

925
01:19:27,177 --> 01:19:28,178
Scott.

926
01:19:28,345 --> 01:19:31,849
Medical assistance is on the way.

927
01:19:32,849 --> 01:19:35,102
Please remain calm.

928
01:19:35,269 --> 01:19:38,364
Medical assistance is on the way.

929
01:19:39,106 --> 01:19:41,359
Please remain calm.

930
01:19:41,525 --> 01:19:44,699
Medical assistance is on the way.

931
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:47,201
Please remain calm.

932
01:19:48,448 --> 01:19:50,041
Medical assistance is on the way.

933
01:19:53,161 --> 01:19:55,129
Hey! Moira MacTaggert!

934
01:19:55,289 --> 01:19:56,882
CIA! Thank God you're here!

935
01:20:03,005 --> 01:20:03,881
Wait!

936
01:20:04,673 --> 01:20:05,469
Fire!

937
01:20:11,555 --> 01:20:12,556
I want her.

938
01:20:14,725 --> 01:20:15,567
Him.

939
01:20:17,394 --> 01:20:18,520
Him.

940
01:20:25,569 --> 01:20:27,913
- And her.
- Yes, sir.

941
01:20:31,867 --> 01:20:32,868
Leave the kids.

942
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,505
- What do we do?
- Keep quiet.

943
01:20:43,253 --> 01:20:45,381
X-Ray 7, I'm doing a final sweep
of the ground.

944
01:20:54,014 --> 01:20:56,016
Let's get them on the bird!

945
01:20:56,183 --> 01:20:57,184
Clear!

946
01:21:03,190 --> 01:21:06,114
Thanks, Jean. We gotta help them.

947
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:08,449
- Kurt, can you get us in that thing?
- You want to get in there?

948
01:21:09,071 --> 01:21:10,197
What if the soldiers see us?

949
01:21:10,364 --> 01:21:12,037
Don't worry, they won't see us. Trust me.

950
01:21:14,409 --> 01:21:15,251
Hold on.

951
01:21:31,468 --> 01:21:33,470
Kurt, get us all out of here!

952
01:21:35,138 --> 01:21:36,481
I can't!

953
01:21:36,640 --> 01:21:40,144
When they closed the doors,
there's some kind of electrical field.

954
01:21:40,310 --> 01:21:41,562
It's like Berlin all over.

955
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,272
Jean, get in the pilots' heads.
Don't let them take off.

956
01:21:43,438 --> 01:21:46,612
I can't. I can't reach the pilots.
I can't reach anyone.

957
01:21:54,157 --> 01:21:56,501
We're also getting reports
out of Europe and Asia.

958
01:21:56,660 --> 01:21:58,833
This was not just a U.S. phenomenon.

959
01:21:58,995 --> 01:22:03,171
It seems the entire world
has been disarmed of nuclear weapons.

960
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:04,676
The Pentagon has confirmed
multiple launches...

961
01:22:04,835 --> 01:22:07,179
from Russia, as well as
the UK, Israel and China.

962
01:22:07,337 --> 01:22:08,680
- Look!
- Look up there!

963
01:22:08,839 --> 01:22:11,342
So far, there has been no response
from the White House.

964
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:14,512
Eyewitness reports have been pouring in
from affiliates across the globe.

965
01:22:14,678 --> 01:22:18,353
Authorities are not sure if it was
an act of peace or an act of war.

966
01:22:25,313 --> 01:22:27,190
Our dear Father...

967
01:22:28,191 --> 01:22:29,784
hold me in the light of God.

968
01:22:34,531 --> 01:22:36,374
It should have been me.

969
01:22:37,784 --> 01:22:41,004
He was the one that was
gonna do something with his life.

970
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:42,706
He was always the one.

971
01:22:44,458 --> 01:22:46,176
That's not how he felt.

972
01:22:47,002 --> 01:22:50,723
He felt you were the one that was gonna
do something special with your life.

973
01:22:51,882 --> 01:22:54,977
That you were gonna
make a difference in the world.

974
01:22:56,136 --> 01:22:58,355
Maybe even change it.

975
01:22:58,889 --> 01:23:01,062
How do you know what he felt?

976
01:23:02,142 --> 01:23:04,395
I know what everybody feels.

977
01:23:19,910 --> 01:23:22,459
Hold me in the light of God.

978
01:23:23,205 --> 01:23:25,708
Protect me from danger.

979
01:23:26,458 --> 01:23:28,881
Save me by Your command.

980
01:23:30,212 --> 01:23:32,089
Listen to my prayer.

981
01:23:33,173 --> 01:23:35,016
And keep me safe.

982
01:24:10,252 --> 01:24:12,550
You're blocking me.

983
01:24:12,712 --> 01:24:13,713
How?

984
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:16,178
I can shield their minds from your power.

985
01:24:16,341 --> 01:24:19,811
It's one of the many gifts I've acquired
throughout the millennia.

986
01:24:19,970 --> 01:24:22,598
But to see...

987
01:24:22,764 --> 01:24:24,311
inside a mind...

988
01:24:24,474 --> 01:24:26,693
to control it...

989
01:24:27,936 --> 01:24:29,483
that's your gift.

990
01:24:31,064 --> 01:24:33,192
You saw it, didn't you?

991
01:24:33,358 --> 01:24:35,452
The glory of what's to come.

992
01:24:36,444 --> 01:24:41,704
You're going to take part
in all this killing and destruction?

993
01:24:42,242 --> 01:24:43,494
It's all I've ever known.

994
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:45,333
No, it isn't.

995
01:24:45,704 --> 01:24:46,830
You've just forgotten.

996
01:24:46,997 --> 01:24:48,920
No, Charles, I remember.

997
01:24:51,251 --> 01:24:52,798
Your way doesn't work.

998
01:24:53,169 --> 01:24:55,968
I've shown him a better way.

999
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:57,428
A better world.

1000
01:24:57,591 --> 01:25:00,686
No, you've just tapped into his rage
and pain. That's all you've done.

1001
01:25:01,261 --> 01:25:04,561
I told you from the moment I met you,
there is more to you, Erik.

1002
01:25:04,723 --> 01:25:07,351
There is good in you, too.

1003
01:25:07,517 --> 01:25:10,316
Whatever it is you think
you saw in me, Charles...

1004
01:25:12,647 --> 01:25:14,320
I buried it...

1005
01:25:14,482 --> 01:25:17,281
with my family.

1006
01:25:28,955 --> 01:25:29,751
What?

1007
01:25:30,415 --> 01:25:31,792
What's wrong with you?

1008
01:25:31,958 --> 01:25:33,881
Is that going to happen to all of us?

1009
01:25:34,878 --> 01:25:35,800
No, I just...

1010
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:37,214
left my meds in the house.

1011
01:25:38,173 --> 01:25:39,299
What happened? Where are we?

1012
01:25:39,466 --> 01:25:40,308
Hey!

1013
01:25:41,009 --> 01:25:42,010
Hello, Mystique.

1014
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:43,603
Major Stryker.

1015
01:25:43,762 --> 01:25:44,684
Colonel Stryker.

1016
01:25:44,846 --> 01:25:46,974
I wouldn't get too close to the wall,
if I were you.

1017
01:25:47,140 --> 01:25:49,234
It may create some discomfort.

1018
01:25:49,392 --> 01:25:51,986
I'm Moira MacTaggert.
I'm a senior officer at the CIA.

1019
01:25:52,145 --> 01:25:54,273
I know who you are, Agent MacTaggert.

1020
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:56,157
You cannot keep me here, in this...

1021
01:25:56,316 --> 01:25:57,533
Actually, I can.

1022
01:25:57,692 --> 01:26:01,617
A psychic event just destroyed
every nuke from here to Moscow.

1023
01:26:01,780 --> 01:26:05,501
That event emanated from exactly
where we found you.

1024
01:26:05,659 --> 01:26:08,128
At the home of the world's
most powerful psychic.

1025
01:26:08,286 --> 01:26:11,210
So, you are going to tell me,
where is Charles Xavier?

1026
01:26:12,749 --> 01:26:14,376
It's not him you should be worried about.

1027
01:26:14,542 --> 01:26:17,637
There's someone else.
Someone more powerful.

1028
01:26:18,296 --> 01:26:21,391
If you let us out of here,
we can help you.

1029
01:26:22,467 --> 01:26:25,061
Do you really expect me to believe that?

1030
01:26:25,595 --> 01:26:28,269
You can put on any face that you want,
but I know who you are.

1031
01:26:28,431 --> 01:26:29,808
What you are.

1032
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:36,857
Hey, Moira.

1033
01:26:37,023 --> 01:26:38,775
What did you mean when you said...

1034
01:26:38,942 --> 01:26:40,819
someone more powerful than Charles?

1035
01:26:43,071 --> 01:26:44,744
Once they finish these,
we'll go from there.

1036
01:26:51,496 --> 01:26:52,918
What's taking so long?

1037
01:26:53,081 --> 01:26:54,207
I can't get in.

1038
01:26:54,374 --> 01:26:57,048
They have a field around it,
like the helicopter.

1039
01:26:57,252 --> 01:26:59,300
There's gotta be a way to cut the power.

1040
01:26:59,462 --> 01:27:00,463
Charles...

1041
01:27:00,839 --> 01:27:02,933
you will send a message...

1042
01:27:03,091 --> 01:27:04,764
to every living mind.

1043
01:27:04,926 --> 01:27:08,681
You will tell them
that this earth will be laid waste.

1044
01:27:08,847 --> 01:27:10,599
That it is I, En Sabah Nur...

1045
01:27:10,765 --> 01:27:12,483
who will wreak this upon them.

1046
01:27:19,149 --> 01:27:20,776
Now...

1047
01:27:20,942 --> 01:27:23,946
deliver my message.

1048
01:27:24,112 --> 01:27:25,910
Even if I wanted to...

1049
01:27:26,072 --> 01:27:28,575
I couldn't reach that many people.
I don't have Cerebro.

1050
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,588
You don't need a machine...

1051
01:27:33,747 --> 01:27:36,170
to amplify your powers.

1052
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:39,089
You have me.

1053
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:54,768
Guys, that could be our way out of here.

1054
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:00,990
You know him? Magneto?

1055
01:28:02,567 --> 01:28:03,910
I used to.

1056
01:28:04,819 --> 01:28:06,116
Not so sure anymore.

1057
01:28:06,613 --> 01:28:08,331
What was he like?

1058
01:28:08,490 --> 01:28:11,494
Was he like they say he was? Was he...

1059
01:28:13,161 --> 01:28:14,378
the bad guy?

1060
01:28:14,537 --> 01:28:15,629
No.

1061
01:28:16,748 --> 01:28:19,718
I mean, yeah. He was...

1062
01:28:21,836 --> 01:28:24,555
Why do you care so much?
You see his speech on TV or something?

1063
01:28:25,006 --> 01:28:27,384
Yeah, but...

1064
01:28:31,554 --> 01:28:33,056
He's my father.

1065
01:28:33,223 --> 01:28:34,349
What?

1066
01:28:34,724 --> 01:28:36,317
- Him and my mom, they did it.
- No, I know...

1067
01:28:36,935 --> 01:28:38,061
Are you sure?

1068
01:28:38,228 --> 01:28:41,107
Yeah. He left my mom before I was born.

1069
01:28:41,523 --> 01:28:42,695
I met him 10 years back...

1070
01:28:42,857 --> 01:28:44,325
but I didn't know it was him.

1071
01:28:44,484 --> 01:28:47,112
By the time I figured it out,
it was too late.

1072
01:28:47,570 --> 01:28:49,618
Then, this week I saw him on TV again...

1073
01:28:49,781 --> 01:28:52,284
and I came to that house,
looking for him...

1074
01:28:52,450 --> 01:28:54,669
but by the time I got there...

1075
01:28:56,955 --> 01:28:58,252
Late again.

1076
01:29:00,834 --> 01:29:02,586
For a guy who moves as fast as me...

1077
01:29:02,752 --> 01:29:04,971
I always seem to be too late.

1078
01:29:05,839 --> 01:29:07,807
Let's hope not this time.

1079
01:29:08,883 --> 01:29:09,725
Yeah.

1080
01:29:09,884 --> 01:29:10,931
Seriously.

1081
01:29:11,094 --> 01:29:12,061
Hear me...

1082
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:13,893
inhabitants of this world.

1083
01:29:15,265 --> 01:29:16,892
- What is that?
- This is a message.

1084
01:29:17,058 --> 01:29:18,605
I think it's the Professor.

1085
01:29:18,768 --> 01:29:22,614
A message to every man, woman,
and mutant in the world.

1086
01:29:22,772 --> 01:29:25,616
You have lost your way.

1087
01:29:26,526 --> 01:29:28,574
You have lost your way.

1088
01:29:28,736 --> 01:29:30,158
But I have returned.

1089
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:33,867
But I have returned.

1090
01:29:34,742 --> 01:29:37,336
The day of reckoning is here.

1091
01:29:38,705 --> 01:29:40,423
All your buildings...

1092
01:29:40,498 --> 01:29:44,594
...all of your towers and temples...

1093
01:29:45,044 --> 01:29:46,637
Will fall.

1094
01:29:46,963 --> 01:29:52,470
And the dawn of a new age will rise.

1095
01:29:52,802 --> 01:29:54,270
...for there is nothing you can do...

1096
01:29:55,054 --> 01:29:56,647
- Jean.
- ...to stop what is coming.

1097
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:01,395
Jean, if you can hear me,
focus on my voice.

1098
01:30:01,561 --> 01:30:03,939
Cairo. Find us, Jean.

1099
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:05,527
Find us. Cairo. Find us.

1100
01:30:06,524 --> 01:30:09,448
This message is for one reason alone.

1101
01:30:09,611 --> 01:30:11,830
To tell the strongest among you...

1102
01:30:11,988 --> 01:30:15,959
Those with the greatest power...

1103
01:30:16,117 --> 01:30:19,542
this earth will be yours.

1104
01:30:20,371 --> 01:30:22,544
Those with the greatest power...

1105
01:30:25,543 --> 01:30:27,216
protect those without.

1106
01:30:30,423 --> 01:30:33,142
That's my message to the world.

1107
01:30:37,430 --> 01:30:39,353
How was Charles doing that
without Cerebro?

1108
01:30:40,099 --> 01:30:42,022
Sir, what was that voice?

1109
01:30:43,102 --> 01:30:44,228
I know that voice.

1110
01:30:44,354 --> 01:30:45,947
It's Xavier, isn't it? What's going on?

1111
01:30:46,105 --> 01:30:47,823
- We don't know!
- We don't know, bro!

1112
01:30:48,733 --> 01:30:49,825
He just spoke to me.

1113
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:52,078
I think he spoke to everyone.

1114
01:30:52,236 --> 01:30:53,658
- I could hear him, too.
- No, no...

1115
01:30:53,821 --> 01:30:55,494
he just sent me a hidden message.

1116
01:30:55,657 --> 01:30:57,159
One he knew only I would hear.

1117
01:30:58,034 --> 01:30:59,081
I know where they are.

1118
01:30:59,827 --> 01:31:00,828
Hey!

1119
01:31:02,246 --> 01:31:04,340
We have shots fired!
Where's it coming from?

1120
01:31:05,833 --> 01:31:07,335
I have intruders in Quad Six.

1121
01:31:09,462 --> 01:31:11,430
Send a security team. Take them out.

1122
01:31:19,305 --> 01:31:21,399
The generator. It's worth a shot.

1123
01:31:22,308 --> 01:31:23,434
Kurt?

1124
01:31:44,956 --> 01:31:47,459
There's some kind of animal in there.

1125
01:31:50,586 --> 01:31:53,055
It's no animal.

1126
01:31:53,756 --> 01:31:54,757
It's a man.

1127
01:31:55,633 --> 01:31:56,634
Who is he?

1128
01:31:58,052 --> 01:32:00,305
That part of him as been taken away.

1129
01:32:01,347 --> 01:32:02,724
What do you mean?

1130
01:32:02,890 --> 01:32:06,315
I mean they turned him into
some kind of weapon.

1131
01:32:11,649 --> 01:32:14,118
Charlie Three, report. Did you find them?

1132
01:32:25,788 --> 01:32:26,789
Shut it down.

1133
01:32:50,772 --> 01:32:51,648
Fire!

1134
01:33:02,450 --> 01:33:03,952
Weapon X is loose!

1135
01:33:04,494 --> 01:33:06,917
I repeat, Weapon X is loose!

1136
01:33:09,332 --> 01:33:10,879
You sure he's not an animal?

1137
01:33:15,713 --> 01:33:18,842
- He's into the central halls.
- Engaging target Sector Five.

1138
01:33:19,592 --> 01:33:20,434
We can't...

1139
01:33:36,859 --> 01:33:37,860
Hey!

1140
01:33:58,589 --> 01:34:00,136
- What are they doing?
- What's going on?

1141
01:34:00,299 --> 01:34:02,643
- I just lost feed.
- Hey! What's going on here?

1142
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:05,642
I'll be right back.

1143
01:34:08,850 --> 01:34:09,897
No!

1144
01:34:26,784 --> 01:34:29,537
Hey! Stay where you are!

1145
01:34:48,806 --> 01:34:49,728
Scott, wait.

1146
01:34:52,435 --> 01:34:53,778
I can help you.

1147
01:34:59,775 --> 01:35:01,027
Jean.

1148
01:35:39,649 --> 01:35:41,617
Logan.

1149
01:36:29,532 --> 01:36:31,034
What'd you do to him?

1150
01:36:32,451 --> 01:36:36,001
I found a piece of his past
and gave it back to him.

1151
01:36:36,330 --> 01:36:38,708
Just the few memories I could reach.

1152
01:36:40,626 --> 01:36:42,970
I hope that's the last we've seen
of that guy.

1153
01:37:02,398 --> 01:37:03,399
Kurt.

1154
01:37:06,193 --> 01:37:07,536
- What?
- What?

1155
01:37:07,695 --> 01:37:08,696
Hey.

1156
01:37:13,743 --> 01:37:16,087
Stay away from the...

1157
01:37:16,245 --> 01:37:17,121
The what?

1158
01:37:17,538 --> 01:37:18,755
The do...

1159
01:37:18,914 --> 01:37:20,086
Stay away from the...

1160
01:37:20,249 --> 01:37:21,375
Get away from the door!

1161
01:37:21,542 --> 01:37:22,543
On three.

1162
01:37:22,710 --> 01:37:24,929
One... two...

1163
01:37:37,933 --> 01:37:39,435
We know where the Professor is.

1164
01:37:39,602 --> 01:37:40,945
I think we might have a way out of here.

1165
01:37:41,103 --> 01:37:44,027
- Well, you've been busy.
- We had a little help.

1166
01:37:45,107 --> 01:37:45,858
Let's go!

1167
01:37:49,362 --> 01:37:50,363
Jesus!

1168
01:37:50,529 --> 01:37:51,530
Oh, sorry!

1169
01:37:51,697 --> 01:37:52,869
This way!

1170
01:38:02,291 --> 01:38:04,794
This was meant to be
the center of the universe...

1171
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,712
before I was betrayed.

1172
01:38:06,879 --> 01:38:08,472
Now...

1173
01:38:08,631 --> 01:38:09,974
it will be.

1174
01:39:30,713 --> 01:39:31,839
Nice.

1175
01:39:32,631 --> 01:39:35,350
Hey, Hank, do you think
you can fly this thing?

1176
01:39:35,801 --> 01:39:37,644
Yeah, I can figure it out.

1177
01:39:39,013 --> 01:39:39,855
Hey, guys.

1178
01:39:41,307 --> 01:39:42,854
Flight suits.

1179
01:39:46,687 --> 01:39:48,689
You got your warplane.

1180
01:39:48,856 --> 01:39:50,233
Let's go to war.

1181
01:39:57,490 --> 01:39:59,242
A gift...

1182
01:39:59,408 --> 01:40:01,331
from the past you left behind...

1183
01:40:02,536 --> 01:40:05,255
and the future that lies ahead.

1184
01:40:06,665 --> 01:40:10,169
You will reach down, my son.

1185
01:40:10,336 --> 01:40:12,464
Deep into the earth.

1186
01:40:12,630 --> 01:40:15,884
Rip everything they've built
from the ground.

1187
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:18,644
Wipe clean this world.

1188
01:40:18,802 --> 01:40:22,352
And we will lead those that survive...

1189
01:40:22,515 --> 01:40:25,314
into a better one.

1190
01:40:25,726 --> 01:40:27,273
And me?

1191
01:40:28,437 --> 01:40:31,031
Am I to play a role in this madness?

1192
01:40:32,733 --> 01:40:36,363
You have the most important role of all.

1193
01:40:47,665 --> 01:40:49,383
Were you scared?

1194
01:40:49,875 --> 01:40:51,843
That day in D.C., were you scared?

1195
01:40:52,002 --> 01:40:52,844
No.

1196
01:40:59,218 --> 01:41:01,892
But I was scared on my first mission.

1197
01:41:02,263 --> 01:41:04,311
I was on a plane like this
with my friends.

1198
01:41:04,723 --> 01:41:06,066
About your age.

1199
01:41:09,687 --> 01:41:11,940
We called ourselves the X-Men.

1200
01:41:13,399 --> 01:41:14,901
Your brother was there.

1201
01:41:15,442 --> 01:41:16,819
We used to call him Havok.

1202
01:41:17,361 --> 01:41:19,284
He was a real handful...

1203
01:41:21,240 --> 01:41:23,834
but when it came down to it,
he was very brave.

1204
01:41:26,161 --> 01:41:28,835
What happened to the rest
of the kids who went with you?

1205
01:41:28,998 --> 01:41:30,170
The X-Men?

1206
01:41:32,960 --> 01:41:34,758
Hank and I are the only ones left.

1207
01:41:35,879 --> 01:41:37,722
I couldn't save the rest of them.

1208
01:41:38,716 --> 01:41:40,718
I told you, I'm not a hero.

1209
01:41:41,218 --> 01:41:43,095
Well, you're a hero to us.

1210
01:41:43,804 --> 01:41:45,556
Seeing you that day on

1211
01:41:45,723 --> 01:41:46,975
changed my life.

1212
01:41:47,516 --> 01:41:48,608
Mine, too.

1213
01:41:49,643 --> 01:41:50,644
Mine, too.

1214
01:41:52,521 --> 01:41:56,071
I still live in my mom's basement
but, you know...

1215
01:41:56,233 --> 01:41:57,906
everything else is...

1216
01:41:59,653 --> 01:42:01,576
It's pretty much the same.

1217
01:42:03,449 --> 01:42:04,826
I'm a total loser.

1218
01:43:04,968 --> 01:43:07,266
What we're seeing is
a magnetic phenomenon...

1219
01:43:07,429 --> 01:43:10,023
on a much larger scale
than what we saw at Auschwitz.

1220
01:43:10,307 --> 01:43:12,730
The ground is full of magnetic elements.

1221
01:43:12,893 --> 01:43:14,520
Iron, nickel, cobalt.

1222
01:43:14,687 --> 01:43:17,065
The ocean's floor is lined with them, too.

1223
01:43:17,231 --> 01:43:19,905
It's already begun at the lowest depths.

1224
01:43:20,067 --> 01:43:23,196
Land masses will slow it,
but not for long.

1225
01:43:23,362 --> 01:43:26,206
Eventually, cities, urban centers...

1226
01:43:26,365 --> 01:43:28,618
anything built since the Bronze Age...

1227
01:43:28,784 --> 01:43:30,081
will be wiped away.

1228
01:43:30,244 --> 01:43:31,666
The death toll will be in the billions.

1229
01:43:31,829 --> 01:43:34,207
He's talking about
the whole goddamn world.

1230
01:44:23,547 --> 01:44:24,799
You're just another false god.

1231
01:44:25,841 --> 01:44:28,139
And whoever's left to follow you
when this all over...

1232
01:44:28,302 --> 01:44:31,397
they will betray you again.

1233
01:44:33,599 --> 01:44:35,522
You're wrong, Charles.

1234
01:44:35,934 --> 01:44:39,529
For the first time
in a thousand lifetimes...

1235
01:44:39,688 --> 01:44:41,190
I have you.

1236
01:44:41,690 --> 01:44:47,288
For all my gifts, I have yet
to possess the one I needed most.

1237
01:44:47,946 --> 01:44:49,163
To be...

1238
01:44:49,907 --> 01:44:51,830
everywhere.

1239
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:56,042
To be...

1240
01:44:56,830 --> 01:44:58,082
everyone.

1241
01:45:13,889 --> 01:45:15,812
Seventh wonder, twelve o'clock.

1242
01:45:24,066 --> 01:45:26,068
He has the Professor
in the center of the pyramid.

1243
01:45:27,236 --> 01:45:30,615
He's going to transfer his consciousness
into the Professor.

1244
01:45:30,781 --> 01:45:35,127
If he does that, he'll have the power
to control every mind in the world.

1245
01:45:42,167 --> 01:45:44,340
What the hell is that?

1246
01:45:45,254 --> 01:45:46,426
It's Erik.

1247
01:45:56,348 --> 01:45:58,316
You guys help Nightcrawler
get into the pyramid.

1248
01:46:00,269 --> 01:46:02,818
Get Charles. I'll take care of Erik.

1249
01:46:02,980 --> 01:46:04,778
How are we gonna get through that?

1250
01:46:05,607 --> 01:46:06,779
I can get you in there.

1251
01:46:07,442 --> 01:46:08,989
I came here for him. Let me help you.

1252
01:46:10,362 --> 01:46:12,956
The rest of you, get Charles on this
plane and get him out of here.

1253
01:46:13,115 --> 01:46:14,833
- We're not leaving without you!
- Don't worry.

1254
01:46:15,701 --> 01:46:16,668
We'll catch up.

1255
01:46:16,952 --> 01:46:18,044
Hold on.

1256
01:46:48,650 --> 01:46:49,867
Hank, you go with the kids.

1257
01:46:50,027 --> 01:46:52,325
- Moira will be waiting on the plane.
- Wait.

1258
01:46:52,654 --> 01:46:53,655
What?

1259
01:46:53,822 --> 01:46:56,166
Not all of us can
fully control our powers.

1260
01:46:56,658 --> 01:46:58,001
Then don't.

1261
01:46:58,327 --> 01:47:00,000
You need to embrace them.

1262
01:47:03,332 --> 01:47:04,424
We all do.

1263
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,364
Go. Join the others.

1264
01:47:31,526 --> 01:47:34,700
Protect me,
until the transference is complete.

1265
01:47:59,888 --> 01:48:01,390
There's an entrance. It's clear.

1266
01:48:05,727 --> 01:48:07,320
Kurt! Get in there!

1267
01:48:18,240 --> 01:48:19,583
In the pyramid! Move!

1268
01:48:20,325 --> 01:48:21,326
Go!

1269
01:48:57,821 --> 01:48:58,947
Split them up.

1270
01:49:22,637 --> 01:49:23,638
Professor...

1271
01:49:27,642 --> 01:49:28,814
Kurt, you have to hurry!

1272
01:49:28,977 --> 01:49:31,150
I'm trying. It's like a maze in here.

1273
01:49:41,490 --> 01:49:42,491
Kurt, no!

1274
01:50:08,016 --> 01:50:09,859
The magnetic field is too strong.
I can't get us in there.

1275
01:50:12,854 --> 01:50:13,946
Erik!

1276
01:50:21,196 --> 01:50:22,197
Mystique.

1277
01:50:26,535 --> 01:50:29,459
I know you think you've lost everything.

1278
01:50:30,247 --> 01:50:31,715
But you haven't.

1279
01:50:33,291 --> 01:50:35,385
You have me.

1280
01:50:35,710 --> 01:50:37,462
You have Charles.

1281
01:50:43,552 --> 01:50:46,226
You have more family than you know.

1282
01:50:47,389 --> 01:50:50,063
You never had the chance
to save your family before.

1283
01:50:51,226 --> 01:50:52,899
But you do now.

1284
01:50:55,564 --> 01:50:58,067
That's what I've come here to tell you.

1285
01:51:03,446 --> 01:51:05,073
And you?

1286
01:51:13,915 --> 01:51:15,588
I'm your...

1287
01:51:19,921 --> 01:51:22,265
I'm here for my family, too.

1288
01:52:11,514 --> 01:52:13,357
Get out. Get out!

1289
01:52:13,516 --> 01:52:14,813
Get out!

1290
01:52:21,691 --> 01:52:23,159
Auf Wiedersehen.

1291
01:52:34,746 --> 01:52:36,168
We're losing him.

1292
01:52:52,347 --> 01:52:53,269
I'll be right back.

1293
01:53:04,401 --> 01:53:05,698
Scott, glasses on!

1294
01:53:15,704 --> 01:53:16,546
Let's go!

1295
01:53:33,555 --> 01:53:35,057
- Locked on.
- Here we go.

1296
01:53:52,907 --> 01:53:54,079
Psylocke!

1297
01:54:10,425 --> 01:54:11,642
What the hell was that?

1298
01:54:18,308 --> 01:54:19,434
Kurt.

1299
01:54:19,768 --> 01:54:20,985
Everyone, grab hold of Nightcrawler!

1300
01:54:21,269 --> 01:54:22,612
I've never done it with this many people.

1301
01:54:22,771 --> 01:54:23,613
Get us out of here.

1302
01:54:39,621 --> 01:54:40,793
Kurt, hurry!

1303
01:54:42,374 --> 01:54:43,296
Kurt!

1304
01:55:09,401 --> 01:55:10,903
Charles...

1305
01:55:16,324 --> 01:55:17,166
Is he okay?

1306
01:55:17,826 --> 01:55:20,079
It's his energy. He's drained.

1307
01:55:21,496 --> 01:55:22,497
Get out.

1308
01:55:23,498 --> 01:55:24,340
Get out!

1309
01:55:24,499 --> 01:55:26,843
Professor, it's okay. You're with us.

1310
01:55:27,919 --> 01:55:29,341
It's okay.

1311
01:55:38,012 --> 01:55:40,640
I'm going to fight for what I have left.

1312
01:55:44,018 --> 01:55:45,986
Are you?

1313
01:55:58,825 --> 01:56:01,328
There's so much more to you than you know.

1314
01:56:01,494 --> 01:56:04,464
Not just pain and anger.

1315
01:56:04,622 --> 01:56:06,499
There's good, too. I felt it.

1316
01:56:07,000 --> 01:56:08,877
It's not just me you're walking away from.

1317
01:56:09,043 --> 01:56:13,219
Here, you have the chance to be a part of
something much bigger than yourself.

1318
01:56:13,381 --> 01:56:16,225
And it needs you, Erik.

1319
01:56:45,038 --> 01:56:47,166
Useless.

1320
01:56:52,504 --> 01:56:53,847
Charles.

1321
01:56:56,090 --> 01:56:58,218
I know you can hear me.

1322
01:56:59,093 --> 01:57:02,097
We're still connected.

1323
01:57:05,892 --> 01:57:06,893
Charles!

1324
01:57:08,019 --> 01:57:09,441
Show yourself!

1325
01:57:11,064 --> 01:57:12,611
Charles!

1326
01:57:13,399 --> 01:57:15,618
Show yourself!

1327
01:57:45,223 --> 01:57:47,100
Foolish child.

1328
01:57:55,775 --> 01:57:56,742
Peter.

1329
01:58:13,835 --> 01:58:14,836
End him.

1330
01:58:41,529 --> 01:58:42,530
Raven.

1331
01:58:50,830 --> 01:58:52,207
The great hero.

1332
01:58:57,295 --> 01:58:59,514
- I'm going out there.
- I'm going with you.

1333
01:58:59,672 --> 01:59:00,889
No.

1334
01:59:02,091 --> 01:59:03,308
It's me he wants.

1335
01:59:03,468 --> 01:59:04,594
Charles, you can't give yourself up.

1336
01:59:05,178 --> 01:59:07,055
If he has you, he has us all.

1337
01:59:07,221 --> 01:59:08,848
The whole world.

1338
01:59:09,015 --> 01:59:10,767
You are feeble.

1339
01:59:10,933 --> 01:59:11,980
Just like the others.

1340
01:59:13,186 --> 01:59:14,187
Charles!

1341
01:59:14,354 --> 01:59:15,196
Come!

1342
01:59:15,355 --> 01:59:16,982
Rescue your weaklings!

1343
01:59:18,358 --> 01:59:20,201
Give your life for theirs!

1344
01:59:22,236 --> 01:59:23,237
No.

1345
01:59:31,371 --> 01:59:32,418
He was right.

1346
01:59:33,539 --> 01:59:36,042
There is still some part of me
connected to him.

1347
01:59:37,001 --> 01:59:37,797
Charles!

1348
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:39,553
I can get inside his head.

1349
01:59:39,712 --> 01:59:41,635
Will you do nothing?

1350
01:59:43,049 --> 01:59:44,801
Thank you for letting me in.

1351
02:00:02,944 --> 02:00:04,491
You want what I have?

1352
02:00:04,654 --> 02:00:06,827
You want to feel what I feel?

1353
02:00:18,626 --> 02:00:19,969
Welcome to my world!

1354
02:00:22,630 --> 02:00:23,631
You're in my house now!

1355
02:00:34,058 --> 02:00:36,060
You'll need a bigger house.

1356
02:01:55,473 --> 02:01:57,066
You betray me?

1357
02:01:57,225 --> 02:01:58,226
No.

1358
02:01:59,143 --> 02:02:00,645
I betrayed them.

1359
02:02:28,923 --> 02:02:30,015
Let's jump.

1360
02:02:30,174 --> 02:02:31,016
What?

1361
02:02:36,430 --> 02:02:37,431
Cover me.

1362
02:02:39,892 --> 02:02:41,394
I got you.

1363
02:02:46,566 --> 02:02:47,783
Come on!

1364
02:03:09,046 --> 02:03:11,640
They lack strength, Charles.

1365
02:03:17,805 --> 02:03:19,102
Jean.

1366
02:03:24,770 --> 02:03:26,067
Come here.

1367
02:03:38,451 --> 02:03:39,748
Help...

1368
02:03:42,246 --> 02:03:43,589
me.

1369
02:03:48,461 --> 02:03:49,838
Stay here.

1370
02:03:59,138 --> 02:04:00,765
They can't stop him.

1371
02:04:01,432 --> 02:04:02,604
Jean.

1372
02:04:05,019 --> 02:04:07,238
Help me!

1373
02:04:30,294 --> 02:04:31,420
Hank!

1374
02:04:32,672 --> 02:04:33,468
Hank!

1375
02:04:40,930 --> 02:04:43,900
It's over, Charles. You're finished.

1376
02:04:44,058 --> 02:04:45,651
You're mine now.

1377
02:04:48,062 --> 02:04:50,736
You will never win.

1378
02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:53,113
And why is that?

1379
02:04:53,275 --> 02:04:55,403
Because you are alone.

1380
02:04:57,279 --> 02:05:00,624
And I am not!

1381
02:05:12,670 --> 02:05:13,842
Let...

1382
02:05:14,296 --> 02:05:15,673
go.

1383
02:05:16,298 --> 02:05:18,096
Unleash your power, Jean.

1384
02:05:19,552 --> 02:05:20,849
No fear.

1385
02:06:08,976 --> 02:06:11,195
Unleash your power!

1386
02:06:11,645 --> 02:06:13,363
Let go, Jean!

1387
02:06:13,814 --> 02:06:15,782
Jean, let go!

1388
02:06:51,602 --> 02:06:53,229
He's getting away.

1389
02:07:10,746 --> 02:07:14,376
All is revealed.

1390
02:08:16,187 --> 02:08:17,939
Charles! Charles!

1391
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,441
- We've lost him!
- Charles.

1392
02:08:20,608 --> 02:08:22,281
- He's gone.
- No, Charles.

1393
02:08:22,443 --> 02:08:23,444
Charles...

1394
02:08:23,944 --> 02:08:25,116
No, he's not.

1395
02:08:26,530 --> 02:08:27,782
I can still feel him.

1396
02:08:51,972 --> 02:08:53,645
Thank you, Jean.

1397
02:08:55,726 --> 02:08:56,727
Charles?

1398
02:08:57,728 --> 02:08:59,355
Charles, do you know where you are?

1399
02:09:02,816 --> 02:09:04,489
I'm on a beach.

1400
02:09:10,574 --> 02:09:12,247
In Cuba.

1401
02:09:13,994 --> 02:09:15,416
With you.

1402
02:09:15,829 --> 02:09:17,331
What beach?

1403
02:09:24,880 --> 02:09:25,676
Charles Xavier.

1404
02:09:52,783 --> 02:09:53,875
I'm sorry.

1405
02:09:54,868 --> 02:09:57,212
I should never have taken those from you.

1406
02:10:00,624 --> 02:10:01,750
Hold on!

1407
02:10:06,755 --> 02:10:08,052
What did I miss?

1408
02:10:10,926 --> 02:10:13,395
It seems only by the grace of God...

1409
02:10:13,554 --> 02:10:14,771
that the ominous destruction...

1410
02:10:14,930 --> 02:10:17,774
seen from one end of the globe
to the other, has stopped.

1411
02:10:17,933 --> 02:10:20,311
At a debriefing today,
CIA Special Agent Moira MacTaggert...

1412
02:10:20,477 --> 02:10:22,650
revealed to an investigative committee...

1413
02:10:22,813 --> 02:10:25,783
The committee was further stunned
to learn that fugitive Erik Lehnsherr...

1414
02:10:25,941 --> 02:10:28,160
aided in defeating
this powerful and unknown...

1415
02:10:28,319 --> 02:10:30,663
I think our prayers were answered.

1416
02:10:31,405 --> 02:10:32,827
Thank you, Mr. President.

1417
02:10:32,990 --> 02:10:34,492
The potential destructive power
of mutants...

1418
02:10:34,658 --> 02:10:36,752
...is sure to fuel new controversy
and debate...

1419
02:10:36,910 --> 02:10:40,631
at a time when mutants were becoming
accepted around the world.

1420
02:11:07,775 --> 02:11:10,198
Mystique told me he is your father.

1421
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:13,368
Are you gonna tell him?

1422
02:11:14,615 --> 02:11:15,616
I might...

1423
02:11:16,533 --> 02:11:17,705
one day.

1424
02:11:19,286 --> 02:11:22,210
I think for now, I'm just gonna
stick around here for a while.

1425
02:11:27,961 --> 02:11:29,133
Me, too.

1426
02:11:40,224 --> 02:11:43,228
The world's already begun
rebuilding its arsenals.

1427
02:11:43,852 --> 02:11:46,150
It's human nature, Charles.

1428
02:11:47,856 --> 02:11:49,199
I still have hope.

1429
02:11:50,484 --> 02:11:51,485
Oh, yes.

1430
02:11:52,903 --> 02:11:53,995
"Hope."

1431
02:11:54,822 --> 02:11:56,665
I was right about Raven.

1432
02:11:57,408 --> 02:11:59,081
I was even right about you.

1433
02:12:02,579 --> 02:12:04,081
What about the rest of the world?

1434
02:12:05,999 --> 02:12:08,718
Doesn't it ever wake you up
in the middle of the night?

1435
02:12:10,879 --> 02:12:13,928
The feeling that one day
they'll come for you...

1436
02:12:14,091 --> 02:12:16,185
and your children.

1437
02:12:17,594 --> 02:12:19,346
It does, indeed.

1438
02:12:19,513 --> 02:12:22,357
What do you do when you wake up to that?

1439
02:12:23,559 --> 02:12:26,028
I feel a great swell of pity
for the poor soul...

1440
02:12:26,186 --> 02:12:29,531
that comes to my school
looking for trouble.

1441
02:12:34,528 --> 02:12:36,747
You're sure I can't convince you to stay?

1442
02:12:38,407 --> 02:12:40,205
You're psychic, Charles.

1443
02:12:40,701 --> 02:12:42,578
You can convince me to do anything.

1444
02:12:45,372 --> 02:12:47,045
Goodbye, old friend.

1445
02:12:47,958 --> 02:12:49,551
Good luck, Professor.

1446
02:12:54,965 --> 02:12:56,387
Forget everything you think you know.

1447
02:12:58,385 --> 02:13:00,763
Whatever lessons you learned in school...

1448
02:13:02,139 --> 02:13:04,062
whatever your parents taught you.

1449
02:13:05,559 --> 02:13:08,403
None of that matters!

1450
02:13:09,897 --> 02:13:11,740
You're not kids anymore.

1451
02:13:12,316 --> 02:13:13,943
You're not students.

1452
02:13:18,071 --> 02:13:19,493
You're X-Men.

1453
02:13:20,305 --> 02:14:20,477
