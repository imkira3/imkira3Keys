00:00:18,924 --> 00:00:22,412
<i>Long ago, when the pyramids
were still young, -</i>

3
00:00:22,657 --> 00:00:26,953
<i>- Egyptian kings played a game
of great and terrible power.</i>

4
00:00:27,125 --> 00:00:31,886
<i>They did battle with magic and
monsters for riches and glory.</i>

5
00:00:32,057 --> 00:00:34,955
<i>From these Shadow Games
erupted a war -</i>

6
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,488
<i>- that threatened to
destroy the world, -</i>

7
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:42,112
<i>- until a brave and powerful pharaoh
locked the dark magic away, -</i>

8
00:00:42,323 --> 00:00:47,780
<i>- imprisoning it for all eternity within
the mystical Millennium Items.</i>

9
00:00:48,023 --> 00:00:52,116
<i>But even eternity
doesn't last forever.</i>

10
00:00:57,191 --> 00:01:02,021
<i>It was never to happen, and
for 5000 years it never did.</i>

11
00:01:02,191 --> 00:01:06,350
<i>The secret of the Millennium Puzzle
remain safely beyond reach.</i>

12
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:11,354
<i>Within the imponderable conundrum
of it's intricate design.</i>

13
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:15,886
<i>For a boy named Yugi, the mystery
of the Millennium Puzzle -</i>

14
00:01:16,057 --> 00:01:17,353
<i>- remains just that.</i>

15
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:23,614
<i>The solution, if one exists, eludes him
as it did those that came before him.</i>

16
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:27,256
<i>But this time, fate has played
a hand in bringing the puzzle -</i>

17
00:01:27,457 --> 00:01:30,616
<i>- and this person together.</i>

18
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,751
<i>It was never to happen.</i>

19
00:01:37,957 --> 00:01:41,390
<i>And for 5000 years it never did.</i>

20
00:01:41,556 --> 00:01:44,249
<i>But while the desert
does it's best to conceal -</i>

21
00:01:44,423 --> 00:01:46,651
<i>- that which should
remain burried, -</i>

22
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:51,653
<i>- it eventually yielded it's most
ancient and terrible secrets.</i>

23
00:01:56,823 --> 00:02:00,449
We found it. The lost
tomb of Anubis.

brought by produksiz from Subscene

26
00:02:15,757 --> 00:02:19,190
Professor, what do you
make of this? It's amazing.

27
00:02:19,457 --> 00:02:23,116
What possessed them to put
the sarcophagus in chains?

28
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:27,188
Hey, all right!

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,655
Maybe this one next.

30
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,411
Yeah! One to go.

31
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:38,985
I've almost solved the
Millennium Puzzle.

32
00:02:39,789 --> 00:02:41,914
Now what have we here?

33
00:02:55,856 --> 00:02:58,288
Grandpa is sure gonna be surprised
when he sees I've figured -

34
00:02:58,456 --> 00:03:00,354
- this puzzle out all by myself.

35
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:03,587
The last piece.

36
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,581
This is it.

37
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:23,780
Awesome! I did it. The
Millennium Puzzle's complete.

38
00:03:38,956 --> 00:03:41,013
What's going on?

39
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:51,385
- There still are men in there.
- The cave collapses.

40
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:54,180
This tomb is cursed.

41
00:04:08,455 --> 00:04:10,921
Hey! What is this?

42
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:39,249
Yu-Gi-Oh!

43
00:04:50,622 --> 00:04:54,678
Shadow Creatures. Begone.
I command you!

44
00:04:54,921 --> 00:04:57,716
Return to the dark realm
from whence you came!

45
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:12,210
<i>It was never to happen but
after 5000 years it did.</i>

46
00:05:12,421 --> 00:05:16,820
<i>And with it the Shadow
Games begin again.</i>

47
00:05:40,287 --> 00:05:43,720
<i>In the three short years since
he started playing Duel Monsters -</i>

48
00:05:43,955 --> 00:05:46,750
<i>- Yugi Moto has risen to
international stardom, -</i>

49
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:50,717
<i>- by becoming the world wide Duel
Monsters card-playing champion.</i>

50
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:54,183
<i>But what makes this young
man such a talented duelist?</i>

51
00:05:54,182 --> 00:05:57,546
<i>Is it his masterly strategies?
Or does the secret lie in the -</i>

52
00:05:57,755 --> 00:06:00,516
<i>- powerful God Cards he's
assembled in his deck?</i>

53
00:06:00,755 --> 00:06:05,210
<i>Whatever the reason, Yugi has proven
his dueling powers time and again.</i>

54
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,750
<i>He has reigned victorious in the
most prestigious tournaments, -</i>

55
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,512
<i>- including the Duelist
Kingdom competition.</i>

56
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,878
<i>And most reasonly the Battle City
Finals where once again -</i>

57
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:18,417
<i>- Yugi defeated former champ
Seto Kaiba to win it all.</i>

58
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,712
Gimme a break. I bet
I could do a circle -

59
00:06:20,921 --> 00:06:22,910
- around this little high
school pipsqueak.

60
00:06:23,155 --> 00:06:26,246
<i>Yugi says his success is due
to his grandfather's coaching -</i>

61
00:06:26,422 --> 00:06:28,785
<i>- and to his belief in the
heart of the cards.</i>

62
00:06:28,987 --> 00:06:32,784
If he'd play me for those God Cards
I'd take that chump down in a flash.

63
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:35,776
<i>But other say it is the
three Egyptian God Cards -</i>

64
00:06:35,987 --> 00:06:38,317
<i>- that make Yugi
virtually unbeatable.</i>

65
00:06:38,488 --> 00:06:42,853
<i>And so the gauntlet is thrown.
Can anyone defeat Yugi Moto -</i>

66
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,474
<i>- and his unstoppable
Egyptian God Cards?</i>

67
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:50,185
You wanted a rematch, Seto Kaiba?

68
00:06:50,887 --> 00:06:52,251
You've got one.

69
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:56,217
And this time things are gonna end
differently, you pompous windbag.

70
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,320
Even you must admit that your
Blue-Eyes White Dragon -

71
00:07:03,521 --> 00:07:05,918
- is powerless against my
Egyptian God Cards.

72
00:07:06,154 --> 00:07:10,210
Make all the smug pronouncements
you like, but know this:

73
00:07:10,387 --> 00:07:13,217
There's got to be a way
to beat your God Cards.

74
00:07:13,387 --> 00:07:15,410
And I won't stop until I find it.

75
00:07:16,754 --> 00:07:19,242
Now I activate the Magic Card -

76
00:07:19,487 --> 00:07:22,214
- Polymerization.

77
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:26,152
This allows me to fuse my
three dragons together, -

78
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:29,286
- to form Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

79
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:33,676
And that's just for starters.

80
00:07:35,253 --> 00:07:39,447
Next I play a Magic Card that doubles
my dragon's attack points:

81
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,212
Megamorph.

82
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,639
Now my Blue-Eyes is more powerful
than any monster on the field.

83
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:51,619
There is more to power
than just attack points.

84
00:07:52,487 --> 00:07:54,749
And just what is that
supposed to mean?

85
00:07:54,954 --> 00:07:59,477
It means my Egyptian God Cards possess
powers far beyond meer monsters.

86
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,550
- They what?
- By sacrificing two of them -

87
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:07,243
- I can bestow upon the
third, infinite strength.

88
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:12,053
They are melting.
Hooling their energy.

89
00:08:17,252 --> 00:08:22,913
Now my Obelisk the Tormentor is
the strongest monster in play.

90
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:28,445
No, I can beat your God Cards.
I won't lose to you again.

91
00:08:29,487 --> 00:08:35,318
Obelisk the Tormentor, show him
what true power is all about.

92
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:41,310
Attack with Fist of Fury!

93
00:08:51,754 --> 00:08:53,413
No.

94
00:08:56,253 --> 00:08:58,412
My dragon.

95
00:09:01,619 --> 00:09:05,176
<i>- No!
- System overload!</i>

96
00:09:05,452 --> 00:09:08,385
The simulation is malfunctioning.

97
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,447
I'm sorry, Mr. Kaiba, but I was
certain that our calculations -

98
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,880
- were correct this time, sir.

99
00:09:16,252 --> 00:09:18,445
If you just give us one
more chance, sir.

100
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:21,207
So you can fail again? Sorry.

101
00:09:21,419 --> 00:09:24,852
Please, sir. We're close to
postulating a winning strategem.

102
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:29,276
Well if I were you I'd start
postulating myself a new job.

103
00:09:30,285 --> 00:09:32,581
You've had more than enough
time to find a way to beat -

104
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:37,343
- Yugi's Egyptian God Cards. But
as usual I have to do it myself.

105
00:09:37,586 --> 00:09:40,052
- Now, get out!
- Ah, man.

106
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:44,810
<i>There's gotta be some way
to defeat Yugi's God Cards.</i>

107
00:09:45,019 --> 00:09:47,485
<i>And I think I know
were to start looking.</i>

108
00:10:33,985 --> 00:10:36,473
The God Cards?

109
00:11:01,485 --> 00:11:03,679
What a horrible nightmare.

110
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:10,850
That's it, no more white wine
spritzers before bedtime for me.

111
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:19,143
Looks peaceful enough.
Yet I sense chaos.

112
00:11:19,386 --> 00:11:22,409
I may have lost my Millennium
Eye some time ago, -

113
00:11:22,651 --> 00:11:27,605
- but I can still see that something
terrible is about to unfold.

114
00:11:35,018 --> 00:11:38,813
About time the museum got a descent
display of Egyptian artifacts.

115
00:11:40,151 --> 00:11:43,311
Hey, that looks just like
a Millennium Item.

116
00:11:44,351 --> 00:11:46,647
This I gotta see.

117
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:58,282
<i>This is flight command.</i>

118
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,940
<i>Initiating Duel Dome
launch convertion. Over.</i>

119
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,482
<i>Roger, dock command.
Prepare launch station -</i>

120
00:12:03,651 --> 00:12:05,617
<i>- for immediate dragon-flight. Over.</i>

121
00:12:05,951 --> 00:12:09,974
<i>We show Mr. Kaiba now
approaching primary flight deck.</i>

122
00:12:15,984 --> 00:12:18,143
Begin complete
systems check at once.

123
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:20,617
<i>- Roger. Vector gauge.
- Check.</i>

124
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:22,510
<i>- Navigation sensors.
- Check.</i>

125
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:27,443
<i>- Ready the launch pad.
- Yes, sir. Opening hangar doors.</i>

126
00:12:34,284 --> 00:12:37,272
<i>Blue-Eyes White Jet,
you are clear for take-off.</i>

127
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:40,279
Activating main thrust rockets.

128
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,610
<i>- I hope you know what you're doing.
- I was just hoping the same thing.</i>

129
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,139
Red wine spritzer, sir.

130
00:13:56,716 --> 00:14:00,479
Can it be? My dear friend Kaiba-boy.

131
00:14:00,751 --> 00:14:02,410
Spare me the pleasantries, Pegasus.

132
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:06,412
You and I have never been friends,
so let's not start pretending that we are.

133
00:14:06,617 --> 00:14:09,083
Oh, my. Sounds like
someone's need a hug.

134
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:12,909
No, thanks. But since you mentioned it,
there is something I need.

135
00:14:13,117 --> 00:14:15,844
Listen. I've come to your
little fantasy island -

136
00:14:15,845 --> 00:14:19,749
- in search of a card powerful enough
to beat Yugi's three Egyptian God Cards.

137
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:24,376
And you believe I'd might have this
all-powerful God-smiting Card because?

138
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,280
Because you created
the game, Pegasus.

139
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:31,007
Once upon a time, Kaiba-boy,
but I'm retired now.

140
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:35,949
The only things I create these days are
places like this for the fishies to enjoy.

141
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,541
I know you, Pegasus.
You created the God Cards -

142
00:14:38,783 --> 00:14:42,011
- and would have never let them
out of your sweaty little hands, -

143
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,841
- unless you also created
a way to beat them.

144
00:14:45,015 --> 00:14:47,742
- Just in case.
- Oh, very well, I confess.

145
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:51,109
I may have one card that could
help, but you can't have it.

146
00:14:51,316 --> 00:14:54,373
- What?
- I'm sorry, Kaiba-boy, -

147
00:14:54,548 --> 00:14:56,811
- but I don't think you deserve it.

148
00:14:56,983 --> 00:15:00,108
True I may not see
as well as I once did.

149
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,908
But to be honest, it
doesn't take a magic eye -

150
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:06,947
- to see just how thoroughly Yugi has
trounced your sorry behind again and again.

151
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,013
Quite frankly it is embarrassing.

152
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,579
Well since I'm such a disappointment,
you should have no trouble -

153
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:16,011
- defeating me in a duel.
- And why would I duel you?

154
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:20,610
Because if you'll put up the card I
need to beat Yugi, I'll wager these.

155
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,815
Wow, you'd rish your precious
Blue-Eyes White Dragons, -

156
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,448
- just for a chance to
trounce little Yugi?

157
00:15:26,649 --> 00:15:30,240
My, my, my, seems you're even
more desperate than I thought.

158
00:15:31,616 --> 00:15:34,082
Well I guess I could dust off my deck.

159
00:15:35,015 --> 00:15:40,209
Kaiba, my dear and devious
friend, let the games begin.

160
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:43,014
- Come on
- Let's go everybody.

161
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:46,115
- Wonder what all the commotion's about?
- Don't know.

162
00:15:46,316 --> 00:15:49,179
But I haven't seen this many people
running from school since they served -

163
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:52,076
- meat loaf surprise last year.

164
00:15:52,416 --> 00:15:55,075
- What in the...
- Let me see.

165
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:58,271
Wonder who these guys
are all waiting for.

166
00:15:58,482 --> 00:16:00,277
It's him.

167
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:03,414
Told you he's alot
smaller than on tv.

168
00:16:03,616 --> 00:16:05,275
Me first. Let me at him.

169
00:16:05,482 --> 00:16:08,209
Please just give me one
shot at those God Cards.

170
00:16:08,382 --> 00:16:11,406
Get out of my way! If anyone
gets the God Cards, it's me.

171
00:16:11,683 --> 00:16:14,877
- Help me!
- What's going on with these guys?

172
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:18,946
Life on the top, Téa. Everyone knows
Yugi is the best duelist around.

173
00:16:19,116 --> 00:16:21,582
So they all want a piece of
him, and those God Cards.

174
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,975
Téa, try to sneak Yugi around the
back, while we hold them off.

175
00:16:25,149 --> 00:16:28,115
- You're sure?
- Yeah, me and Tristan will handle things here.

176
00:16:28,316 --> 00:16:32,112
- Thanks, Joey.
- You can thank him later. Let's go, Yugi.

177
00:16:36,149 --> 00:16:38,638
- The usual plan, T?
- On three, partner.

178
00:16:38,815 --> 00:16:41,280
- On three.
- Quick, after them.

179
00:16:41,482 --> 00:16:44,313
Forget about those nobodies.

180
00:16:44,815 --> 00:16:47,043
- Now wait just a minute.
- What'd you say?

181
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,179
I said you're nobody.

182
00:16:49,348 --> 00:16:51,813
Yeah, that's right. And
everybody knows it too.

183
00:16:51,981 --> 00:16:54,175
Well just everybody
who's anybody, that is.

184
00:16:54,415 --> 00:16:57,246
Listen up. Nobody but
nobody calls me a nobody, -

185
00:16:57,415 --> 00:17:01,575
- a bunch of nobodies. Got that?
- We wanna take on Yugi, not you.

186
00:17:01,749 --> 00:17:03,714
- Yeah, right.
- We want the King of Games, -

187
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:06,881
- not the King of Lame.
- The Duel Monsters champ, not chump.

188
00:17:07,115 --> 00:17:09,910
The Master of the Gods, not
the Master of the Clods.

189
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:13,081
I think I get the point, already.
But you gotta prove yourselves first, -

190
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:16,076
- by doing top-contender,
and I think I know one.

191
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:18,408
- Seto Kaiba?
- Me! Joey Wheeler.

192
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:20,809
So if you wanna get
to the King of Games -

193
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:26,447
- you'll have to go through me,
the Godfather of Games, capiche.

194
00:17:35,949 --> 00:17:38,744
- All right, so who wants some?
- I wants some.

195
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:41,437
Won't take long. Let's do this.

196
00:17:41,682 --> 00:17:43,978
Okay, ladies first.

197
00:17:45,248 --> 00:17:47,339
Funny. Take this!

198
00:17:47,614 --> 00:17:51,479
I summon Injection Fairy
Lily in attack mode.

199
00:17:54,547 --> 00:17:56,638
Hi, there.

200
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,374
Let's give him a check-up, Lily.

201
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,172
Say ah!

202
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:04,912
What the...

203
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:15,773
I sacrifice Fenrir and Inpachi in
order to summon Maju Garzett.

204
00:18:19,647 --> 00:18:22,204
Attack! Sludge Regurgitate.

205
00:18:29,014 --> 00:18:33,777
Hey, didn't nobody ever teach you
to say it, not spray it? Some menace.

206
00:18:33,981 --> 00:18:36,446
Or, boy. Now you're in trouble.

207
00:18:36,647 --> 00:18:40,512
I sacrifice Baby Dragon, Rocket
Warrior and Little-Winguard -

208
00:18:40,748 --> 00:18:43,475
- to summon Gilford the Lightning.

209
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:47,646
Which means all the monsters you got
out on the field are destroyed, pal.

210
00:18:47,848 --> 00:18:49,871
Lightning Sword.

211
00:18:56,647 --> 00:18:58,238
Ah, nuts!

212
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,779
Maybe now, you'll have the
proper respect for Joey -

213
00:19:03,948 --> 00:19:06,004
- the Godfather of Games.

214
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,939
Is the coast clear yet, Joey?

215
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:10,705
Hey, it's Yugi. He's back.

216
00:19:10,913 --> 00:19:13,675
- Let's go, Yugi.
- You better watch out.

217
00:19:13,848 --> 00:19:16,369
We're gonna get ya.

218
00:19:20,446 --> 00:19:24,674
- Yeah, they respect ya.
- I've could have been a contender.

219
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,911
Quick! Yugi, this way.

220
00:19:32,914 --> 00:19:36,312
Those guys just won't give up.
We need to find a place to hide.

221
00:19:36,481 --> 00:19:39,538
Some place where we will be save
from that Duel Monsters mob.

222
00:19:39,814 --> 00:19:41,608
Some place they'd never look.

223
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,143
So want do you think, Kaiba-boy?

224
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:47,939
Is this the latest in duel arena
technology, or what?

225
00:19:48,114 --> 00:19:50,012
This place is an outdated joke.

226
00:19:50,247 --> 00:19:52,974
But then so are you,
so I suppose it fits.

227
00:19:53,247 --> 00:19:57,645
Now, now, Kaiba, let's not get
nasty. Not just yet, anyhow.

228
00:19:58,413 --> 00:20:00,936
Look, enough small talk.

229
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:03,077
Let's duel!

230
00:20:03,246 --> 00:20:05,110
I'll start things off.

231
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:10,774
Oh, dear, I'm afraid you're about to
enter into a world of pain, Kaiba-boy.

232
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,434
A world of chaos. A world
of absolute mayhem.

233
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:19,609
That's right. A world of Toons.

234
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:28,276
Ha, don't tell me that you're actually
still using that idiotic Toon World card.

235
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,775
Well, this is gonna be even
easier than I thought.

236
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:36,135
I summon Toon Gemini
Elf in attack mode.

237
00:20:43,347 --> 00:20:45,074
And this for later.

238
00:20:45,313 --> 00:20:47,472
It's your turn, Kaiba-boy.

239
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,275
I summon X-Head Cannon.

240
00:20:58,481 --> 00:21:01,446
I'll throw two cards face down.

241
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,375
For later.

242
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:06,908
Uh, I'm so scared, Kaiba.
Two cards face down.

243
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,510
Oh, mercy me, what will I do?

244
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:13,176
No wait that I now play this.

245
00:21:13,446 --> 00:21:15,911
Card of Sanctity.

246
00:21:17,546 --> 00:21:20,205
Isn't it pretty? And it allows us
each to draw until we both -

247
00:21:20,412 --> 00:21:23,004
- have six cards in our hand.

248
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:29,603
<i>Just what I needed.And now
I'll activate the Magic Card Cost Down.</i>

249
00:21:29,779 --> 00:21:32,405
- Which means that.
- Do you ever shut up?

250
00:21:32,645 --> 00:21:36,042
I know what it means. Now you can summon
your strongest monsters to the field -

251
00:21:36,245 --> 00:21:37,711
- more easily.

252
00:21:37,912 --> 00:21:40,106
Please, what do you take me
for, some kind of a rookie?

253
00:21:40,346 --> 00:21:43,176
You're not quite that
good, Kaiba-boy.

254
00:21:43,346 --> 00:21:46,141
I summon the Toon Dark Magician Girl.

255
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:50,209
But I won't be using her just yet.

256
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:53,813
First I'll attack with
the Gemini Elves.

257
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:56,938
And I think I'll have
them target... -

258
00:21:59,779 --> 00:22:01,245
- you.

259
00:22:03,646 --> 00:22:05,907
Cartoons are so violent
these days.

260
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:09,238
But we're not through yet.
My elves have another ability.

261
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:14,741
When they deal damage to a player,
that player loses a card from his hand.

262
00:22:14,945 --> 00:22:19,708
Aren't my Toons simply
magnificent, Kaiba-boy?

263
00:22:21,312 --> 00:22:22,800
Oh, don't look so sour.

264
00:22:23,045 --> 00:22:27,477
Think of it this way, at least it will be them
stopping you little quest to the top and not -

265
00:22:27,645 --> 00:22:29,803
- Yugi-boy for the umpteenth time.

266
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:36,001
Now then, let's get on with it, shall we?
Oh, Toon Dark Magician Girl, your turn.

267
00:22:37,512 --> 00:22:41,342
I guess it's true that when you get old,
the mind is the first thing to go, because -

268
00:22:41,511 --> 00:22:43,977
- you forgot all about
my face down cards.

269
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:46,736
And now it's gonna cost you.

270
00:22:49,779 --> 00:22:51,245
Attack Guidance Armor.

271
00:22:51,446 --> 00:22:55,572
This trap's like a magnet that redirects
your own attack right back at you.

272
00:22:55,812 --> 00:22:57,778
No, you wouldn't.

273
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,067
Oh, yes I would. And I will.

274
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:05,472
Guidance Armor, attach to
the Toon Gemini Elves.

275
00:23:26,845 --> 00:23:29,606
But they were just innocent Toons.

276
00:23:29,845 --> 00:23:32,004
You'll pay for that.

277
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:37,266
I activate the Magic Card Monster
Reborn to bring them back.

278
00:23:39,978 --> 00:23:41,943
And play Ultimate Offering.

279
00:23:42,211 --> 00:23:47,008
Now for every 500 life points I give up,
I can summon one additional monster.

280
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:50,736
And by sacrificing my
Toon Gemini Elf, Kaiba-boy, -

281
00:23:50,945 --> 00:23:54,173
- this first monster will be
quite a powerful one.

282
00:23:54,345 --> 00:23:58,038
Introducing the Blue-Eyes
Toon Dragon.

283
00:24:01,445 --> 00:24:03,274
Looks rather vicious, doesn't he?

284
00:24:03,478 --> 00:24:07,536
But don't you worry yourself,
Kaiba-boy, he is actually quite docile.

285
00:24:07,745 --> 00:24:10,609
Well, compared to
the next Toon, that is.

286
00:24:10,811 --> 00:24:15,573
Ladies and gents, the
Toon Summoned Skull.

287
00:24:17,277 --> 00:24:20,402
Sure, I'll have to give up
another 500 of my life ponts, -

288
00:24:20,611 --> 00:24:22,702
- but then, you know what
they say, Kaiba-boy:

289
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:27,309
You have to spend life
points to take life points.

290
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:29,410
Of course, you know all about that.

291
00:24:29,578 --> 00:24:33,533
Yugi's been taking your life points
for what, going on three years now?

292
00:24:33,778 --> 00:24:37,141
Oh, I'm sorry to keep
bringing that up.

293
00:24:38,377 --> 00:24:41,901
I activate the Magic Card Dark Core.

294
00:24:42,344 --> 00:24:44,673
Now by discarding one
card from my hand, -

295
00:24:44,877 --> 00:24:47,206
- I can remove any
monster from the game.

296
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,940
I see.

297
00:24:49,111 --> 00:24:51,702
Well then, I'm sorry
Blue-Eyes Toon Dragon, -

298
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:54,001
- but I guess this is goodbye.

299
00:24:54,244 --> 00:24:57,541
Not quite, Pegasus. You won't
be getting off that easily, -

300
00:24:57,711 --> 00:25:00,905
- because I'm discarding Y-Dragon
Head from my hand.

301
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:04,441
So I can remove X-Head
Cannon from the game.

302
00:25:05,145 --> 00:25:07,804
What? But X-Head Cannon
is your own monster.

303
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,442
What are you scheming?

304
00:25:09,643 --> 00:25:12,303
I also activate the Magic
Card Soul Release.

305
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,977
It removes one more
monster from the game -

306
00:25:15,144 --> 00:25:17,269
- and I'm using it on
my Y-Dragon Head.

307
00:25:17,478 --> 00:25:19,706
Why are you removing
your own monsters?

308
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,206
And now, I summon -

309
00:25:22,378 --> 00:25:25,071
- Z-Metal Tank.

310
00:25:26,777 --> 00:25:28,743
That makes no sense, unless...

311
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:33,070
Unless I still have one
more card to play, Pegasus.

312
00:25:33,276 --> 00:25:34,970
And it so happens I do.

313
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:38,004
Activate Return from the
Different Dimension.

314
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:41,800
It's well worth half my life points
to bring back all my monsters.

315
00:25:42,009 --> 00:25:46,408
And nice trick to know when you wanna
summon more than one monster in a turn.

316
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:51,900
And as you're well aware, these aren't
just any monsters, Pegasus.

317
00:25:52,143 --> 00:25:54,439
They combine.

318
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:05,941
Together they create the
ultimate XYZ-Dragon Cannon.

319
00:26:08,144 --> 00:26:13,371
Yes, now I have all the firepower I need
to blast any card I want out of the duel.

320
00:26:13,677 --> 00:26:17,473
If you still say you're gonna win,
then it's time to change your tune.

321
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:20,973
- Go! Destroy Toon World!
- No!

322
00:26:21,244 --> 00:26:24,107
Use Cannon Firestorm.

323
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,606
That's all folks.

324
00:26:39,809 --> 00:26:43,401
Now let's see which you've
got to beat the Egyptian Gods.

325
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,135
Looks like you had two
cards up your sleeve.

326
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:50,209
What do you mean, two cards?

327
00:26:51,075 --> 00:26:54,167
- Kaiba, there was only one.
- Yeah, right.

328
00:26:54,709 --> 00:26:57,141
Nice try, you snake.

329
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,242
The museum is the last place those
demented duelists would think to look for you.

330
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:06,875
Hope you're right.

331
00:27:07,075 --> 00:27:10,702
Hey, it's some kind of
an Egyptian exhibit.

332
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,607
Look, Téa.

333
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:16,139
That blue pyramid, there.

334
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:20,202
- It looks like my Millennium Puzzle.
- Yeah, it does.

335
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,273
Let's go check it out.

336
00:27:29,743 --> 00:27:34,142
It says: The tomb of Anubis.
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.

337
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:37,504
If we stay here I'm
gonna blow chunks.

338
00:27:38,009 --> 00:27:41,463
Okay, I get the point, Téa.
You're not a mummy fan.

339
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:54,008
Hey, it's my grandfather.
What are you doing here?

340
00:27:54,209 --> 00:27:56,675
Oh, well it looks like great
minds think alike.

341
00:27:57,309 --> 00:28:00,332
- So you came to see that Pyramid, too?
- Yep.

342
00:28:00,576 --> 00:28:03,041
This says, it's called
the Pyramid of Light.

343
00:28:03,275 --> 00:28:07,934
In all my years of egyptology, I've
never come across this relic before.

344
00:28:08,142 --> 00:28:13,096
But it says here it belonged to an evil sorceror
who tried to bring about the end of the world.

345
00:28:13,377 --> 00:28:16,536
Well I guess it's pretty safe to
say his plan didn't work, right?

346
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:19,072
Legends say a brave pharaoh
destroyed him using -

347
00:28:19,242 --> 00:28:21,731
- the mystical Dagger of Fate.

348
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:26,738
The same pharaoh who many believed
possessed your Millennium Puzzle.

349
00:28:26,975 --> 00:28:28,771
Come, I'll show you.

350
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,598
See? There is the knife.

351
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:35,206
- Can we leave?
- What's it say here on his sarcophagus.

352
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,933
Let's see. It's some sort of prophecy.

353
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:43,269
"The eye that sees what's yet to
come its vision shall be fulfilled -"

354
00:28:43,476 --> 00:28:46,169
"- unless blinded by events
predetermined."

355
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,704
"Thus light and shadows
both be killed."

356
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,473
From the light comes the dark.

357
00:29:17,541 --> 00:29:20,440
Téa? Would you read me the
story about the bunny?

358
00:29:20,608 --> 00:29:23,575
I'm gonna pretend that's the concussion
talking and forget all about it.

359
00:29:23,743 --> 00:29:25,265
'Cause right now we
got bigger problems.

360
00:29:25,542 --> 00:29:27,803
Like where King Tut's
freaky cousin went.

361
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:30,530
The mummy's body's been stolen.

362
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:34,729
And that's not all. He napped
that pyramid thing too.

363
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:36,941
Grandpa. Stay here.

364
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:40,108
I have a feeling Kaiba's in
danger. I have to warn him.

365
00:29:40,309 --> 00:29:42,774
- Yugi.
- Just keep an eye on Grandpa.

366
00:29:42,975 --> 00:29:44,305
I'll call you.

367
00:29:45,141 --> 00:29:46,573
What hit me?

368
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:48,935
Probably whatever
broke into the museum.

369
00:29:49,174 --> 00:29:50,663
No. This is terrible.

370
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,966
Yeah, they took the mummy
and the Pyramid of Light.

371
00:29:54,174 --> 00:29:56,834
This is one crime those
crooks is gonna regret.

372
00:29:57,041 --> 00:30:01,871
According to the legend, Anubis found
that he would one day return from the dead.

373
00:30:02,041 --> 00:30:03,904
What's going on?

374
00:30:04,074 --> 00:30:08,234
- You don't really think that...
- Téa, I don't know what to think.

375
00:30:08,475 --> 00:30:12,032
Let's just hope that
legend is just a legend.

376
00:30:14,942 --> 00:30:16,406
Stop the car!

377
00:30:20,974 --> 00:30:24,634
Yugi. I've been looking all over for you.
My brother sent me to find you.

378
00:30:24,808 --> 00:30:28,240
And he says that it's real important
that you bring your Dual Disc, right away.

379
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:31,999
- Wait, so he's okay then?
- I wouldn't say he's okay.

380
00:30:32,174 --> 00:30:35,607
All I know is that Seto hasn't
been acting like himself lately.

381
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:37,467
I think he's gonna
totally lose it.

382
00:30:39,608 --> 00:30:41,505
Way to hold back that crowd, champ.

383
00:30:41,708 --> 00:30:45,265
Or, like you helped. Then again
you duel worse than my mom.

384
00:30:45,507 --> 00:30:48,963
You're just lucky I'm worn out, man.

385
00:30:49,674 --> 00:30:52,970
Check it out. What's Kaiba's
limo doing at Yugi's place?

386
00:30:54,674 --> 00:30:57,072
Hey, Yugi, wait up. Stop!

387
00:30:58,807 --> 00:31:02,501
- Bro, I smell trouble.
- Actually that's me. Sorry about that.

388
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,207
My brother's waiting
for you on the top floor.

389
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,406
I got it. Thanks.

390
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:30,897
<i>Welcome to the
Kaiba Corp. Duel Dome.</i>

391
00:31:32,174 --> 00:31:36,004
<i>Destination: Skytop Dueling Platform.</i>

392
00:31:39,641 --> 00:31:42,004
This is want he wants.

393
00:31:43,141 --> 00:31:46,538
But it is too much of a coincident
that Kaiba would send for us -

394
00:31:46,741 --> 00:31:50,605
- right after the vision we had at the museum.
There must be something more going on here.

395
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:54,068
And I'm pretty sure it has something
to do with that Anubis guy.

396
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,934
It seams like you had some kind of
battle with him 5000 years ago.

397
00:31:58,507 --> 00:32:02,735
Perhaps. But sadly memories of my
days as the pharaoh are clouded, -

398
00:32:02,907 --> 00:32:07,702
- nor is it clear to me what role the
Egyptian God Cards have to play in all this.

399
00:32:07,907 --> 00:32:10,532
I sure wish we knew more about
what happened back in your past.

400
00:32:10,773 --> 00:32:13,399
All that matters is that we
face the future together.

401
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,730
And I wouldn't have it any other
way. Are you ready partner?

402
00:32:16,906 --> 00:32:18,428
Ready.

403
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,697
Yu-Gi-Oh!

404
00:32:26,374 --> 00:32:28,931
Kaiba's car is outside
so Yugi must be here.

405
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:33,105
Wow, you're a regular Sherlock Holmes.
Did you figure that out all by yourself?

406
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:36,431
- Hey, Yugi is upstairs.
- Hey, what's going on?

407
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,300
My brother is about
to duel him.

408
00:33:08,606 --> 00:33:09,902
Welcome.

409
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,969
Glad you came to duel, Yugi.

410
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:14,763
'Cause this time things
are gonna be different.

411
00:33:17,873 --> 00:33:20,838
<i>Initiating duel simulation.</i>

412
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:25,165
<i>Calculating player strength.
God Cards destroyed.</i>

413
00:33:47,173 --> 00:33:49,502
I hope you've brought
your Egyptian God Cards.

414
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:52,071
Otherwise, this duel isn't
gonna be any fun at all.

415
00:33:52,306 --> 00:33:57,238
Kaiba, I'm sensing the present of something far
more dangerous than you can possibly imagine.

416
00:33:57,439 --> 00:33:59,428
<i>Spare me the fairy tales.</i>

417
00:33:59,706 --> 00:34:02,865
- We could all be in great danger.
- I've heard enough.

418
00:34:03,106 --> 00:34:06,231
If you think you sense something
dangerous, you're absolutely right, -

419
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:09,337
- because it's me and my deck,
and in this Duel Monsters match -

420
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,335
- you're about to lose big-time.

421
00:34:11,506 --> 00:34:13,767
Mokuba, seal all of the exits.

422
00:34:14,005 --> 00:34:15,801
If you say so.

423
00:34:22,172 --> 00:34:24,161
- What's the deal?
- We're trapped, man.

424
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:27,530
Now what'd you say we get
down to business, already?

425
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:30,694
Something tells me that this
duel is not a good idea.

426
00:34:30,905 --> 00:34:35,701
Kaiba, why don't you stop thinking about yourself
for once and listen to what I'm telling you?

427
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,136
You're in no position to
be making demands.

428
00:34:39,372 --> 00:34:41,895
So shut up and duel.

429
00:34:42,138 --> 00:34:45,104
And may the best duelist win.

430
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:50,201
- I guess Yugi's going through with this.
- Kaiba ain't leaving him much choice.

431
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:56,434
All duel dome exits are now secured.
All dueling systems are online.

432
00:34:56,706 --> 00:35:00,149
You've been taking credit for being
the best duelist for way too long.

433
00:35:00,151 --> 00:35:02,199
And to tell you the
truth I'm sick of it.

434
00:35:02,439 --> 00:35:08,235
By the time this duel is over, you'll be
exposed to the world as a total fraud.

435
00:35:10,205 --> 00:35:11,194
Let's duel!

436
00:35:11,439 --> 00:35:12,563
I'll start.

437
00:35:18,139 --> 00:35:23,094
First I'll summon my Familiar Knight in
defence mode. Try and get past him.

438
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:26,237
Very well, I shall.

439
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:31,903
I play Queen's Knight.

440
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:36,437
And now, say goodbye
to your monster.

441
00:35:38,105 --> 00:35:40,401
Queen's Knight, attack!

442
00:35:46,971 --> 00:35:50,767
By destroying your knight,
I've activated it's speciel ability -

443
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:53,871
- which allows you to play
a new beast in it's place.

444
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:57,663
What? Yugi's lost it. Why would
he let Kaiba play a monster -

445
00:35:57,664 --> 00:36:00,736
- with 2400 attack points?
- He did what?

446
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:05,068
And you're being so
helpful, because why?

447
00:36:05,271 --> 00:36:08,567
Because by doing so I also get
to summon a new monster.

448
00:36:09,038 --> 00:36:10,901
King's Knight.

449
00:36:13,205 --> 00:36:15,671
And these two knights
are in play I can -

450
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:18,770
- automatically summon
my Jack's Knight.

451
00:36:21,238 --> 00:36:24,602
And next I place one card face down.

452
00:36:24,971 --> 00:36:26,834
Make your move.

453
00:36:31,471 --> 00:36:35,404
Looks like your luck's finally run out.
I'll keep this card face down on the field -

454
00:36:35,637 --> 00:36:38,967
- until the time is right.
Right for me that is.

455
00:36:39,138 --> 00:36:43,434
And then nothing in your deck will
make a difference. Your move, Yugi.

456
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:52,869
An Egyptian God Card.

457
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:59,103
I sacrifice my three knights to
bring forth my ultimate creature.

458
00:37:01,171 --> 00:37:04,364
Behold the Egyptian God Card:

459
00:37:04,572 --> 00:37:08,163
Slifer the Sky Dragon.

460
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:22,264
Your monster is completely defenceless
against the devine power of Slifer.

461
00:37:22,571 --> 00:37:26,003
Now my Sky Dragon. Attack!

462
00:37:33,437 --> 00:37:35,426
Had enough?

463
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,596
Not only am I not afraid
of your God Cards -

464
00:37:39,803 --> 00:37:43,065
- but I'm gonna force you to
summon all three of them at once.

465
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,433
Thanks to my Obligatory
Summon Magic Card -

466
00:37:47,636 --> 00:37:50,363
- you have to bring out every monster
in your deck that falls into -

467
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:53,593
- the same category as the one
that's on the field already.

468
00:37:53,837 --> 00:37:57,429
Very well. Then I play
two more God Cards.

469
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:01,864
Obelisk the Tormentor and
The Winged Dragon of Ra.

470
00:38:22,771 --> 00:38:26,862
You've allowed me to assemble the three strongest
and most feared creatures in Duel Monsters, -

471
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,036
- Kaiba. A foolish mistake.

472
00:38:32,703 --> 00:38:34,135
It's no mistake.

473
00:38:34,304 --> 00:38:38,736
My entire strategy was to draw out
your three Egyptian God Cards, -

474
00:38:38,969 --> 00:38:42,732
- so I can be the first duelist
to crush all of them at once.

475
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:47,631
- And just how do you attend to do that?
- You're about to find out right now.

476
00:38:47,837 --> 00:38:51,235
Reveal Trap Card.
Pyramid of Light.

477
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:56,801
<i>So the Pyramid of Light is more
than just an ancient artifact.</i>

478
00:38:57,436 --> 00:38:59,664
<i>It's also a card.</i>

479
00:39:00,737 --> 00:39:02,725
Now pyramid, activate!

480
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:35,797
Looks like your so called unstoppable
monsters have been stopped.

481
00:39:36,069 --> 00:39:37,796
Impossible.

482
00:39:38,069 --> 00:39:40,433
See for yourself.

483
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,058
Wow, check it out.

484
00:39:49,335 --> 00:39:53,062
- Your monsters are useless.
- But how?

485
00:39:55,802 --> 00:39:58,098
He actually did it.

486
00:40:03,268 --> 00:40:06,030
Yugi. What's this?

487
00:40:12,836 --> 00:40:15,358
Oh, man, not more freaky magic.

488
00:40:15,636 --> 00:40:18,795
This weird stuff always
happens when Yugi duels.

489
00:40:19,002 --> 00:40:23,594
- Hey, what're you looking at?
- I think you got it mad.

490
00:40:24,636 --> 00:40:28,795
- Just hang on, man.
- Easier said than done, Joey.

491
00:40:33,235 --> 00:40:35,225
What's going on?

492
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,334
This is crazy.

493
00:41:07,235 --> 00:41:08,928
It's Kaiba's Duel Dome.

494
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:12,793
That blue beam is the same color of
the Pyramid of Light from the museum -

495
00:41:13,001 --> 00:41:14,830
- and I bet it's no coincidence.

496
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:19,093
What ever is going on in there, one
thing's for sure: It can't be good.

497
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:21,932
Yugi, where are you?

498
00:41:22,869 --> 00:41:26,926
Kaiba, do you have any idea
what you've just done?

499
00:41:27,103 --> 00:41:30,034
Well, let's see. I think I
have just beaten you.

500
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:48,694
Hey, wait a sec. This place
looks kinda familiar.

501
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:52,765
This is where the pharaoh's spirit lives.
Inside the Millennium Puzzle.

502
00:41:52,935 --> 00:41:55,230
I've gotta find it so
we can reconnect.

503
00:41:57,469 --> 00:42:00,593
I'm pretty sure that one of
these rooms belongs to him.

504
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:05,733
Question is, which one? There must
be a million doorways in this place.

505
00:42:11,001 --> 00:42:13,466
Oh, man I feel as bad
as you look, Joey.

506
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:19,564
Tristan. I don't think we're
in Kansas anymore.

507
00:42:19,735 --> 00:42:25,190
It looks like some weird maze. And man,
I think you and I are the lab rats.

508
00:42:25,434 --> 00:42:29,799
Hello? Hello? Pharaoh?

509
00:42:30,601 --> 00:42:32,761
Pharaoh, are you here?

510
00:42:34,435 --> 00:42:36,060
Pharaoh?

511
00:42:38,501 --> 00:42:39,990
Nothing.

512
00:42:40,335 --> 00:42:44,790
Pharaoh!

513
00:42:45,768 --> 00:42:49,961
- You hear that?
- Yeah, it sounded like Yugi. Come on.

514
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:04,930
It hurts doesn't it? When you put your
faith in the Gods and they let you down.

515
00:43:05,134 --> 00:43:08,793
If I were you now is a good time
to start praying for mercy.

516
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:13,093
Because from here on out, I'm planning
to take you apart piece by painful piece.

517
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,698
So let the torture continue with this:

518
00:43:15,867 --> 00:43:18,765
The torrential magic of
Mystical Space Typhoon.

519
00:43:19,134 --> 00:43:22,099
Your face down card is destroyed.

520
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:25,360
And if you like that, then
you're gonna love this:

521
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,566
Peten the Dark Clown.

522
00:43:27,967 --> 00:43:31,558
But don't let his name fool you.
He's no laughing matter.

523
00:43:34,668 --> 00:43:38,225
Now, attack with Bloodlust Slash.

524
00:43:45,467 --> 00:43:49,264
And to top it off I'll place
this face down on the field.

525
00:43:49,701 --> 00:43:55,223
That attack it drained me some.
But I'm far from finished.

526
00:43:55,467 --> 00:44:01,400
Magician's Valkyria, attack!
Mystic Sceptre Blast.

527
00:44:10,134 --> 00:44:12,928
Nice try, Yugi, but I knew
you'd make that move, -

528
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:17,499
- which is why my face down card
is Deck Destruction Virus.

529
00:44:18,467 --> 00:44:21,955
You set off this cribleling trap when
you destroyed my Dark Clown, -

530
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,927
- and now it's viral tentacles will infect
ten random cards from your deck -

531
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,498
- and send them straight to the graveyard.
- Oh, no.

532
00:44:29,733 --> 00:44:34,756
Oh, yes, Yugi. Now say goodbye
to 25 percent of your Duel Deck.

533
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:43,231
No.

534
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,195
I hate to be the bearer
of even more bad news, -

535
00:44:46,367 --> 00:44:48,697
- but when you destroyed
my Peten the Dark Clown, -

536
00:44:48,867 --> 00:44:52,163
- you activated his special ability,
allowing me to summon another -

537
00:44:52,367 --> 00:44:54,890
- Dark Clown to take his place.

538
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:09,362
I summon Des Feral Imp.

539
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,997
And next I'll activate the
magical Card of Demise.

540
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,757
It let's me draw five new
cards from my deck.

541
00:45:15,999 --> 00:45:19,954
But if I don't use them in five turns,
I lose them in five turns.

542
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:25,188
Now I'll sacrifice my Feral Imp and
activate White Dragon Ritual -

543
00:45:25,699 --> 00:45:28,722
- to summon Paladin of White Dragon.

544
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:32,557
Paladin, attack with
Bionic Spear Burst.

545
00:45:44,166 --> 00:45:49,098
When I lose my life points I'm
losing my actual life energy.

546
00:45:49,967 --> 00:45:53,898
And now, I summon
Blue-Eyes White Dragon.

547
00:45:55,933 --> 00:45:57,524
Take a good look.

548
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:00,893
It's the monster that's been the bane
of your dueling existence ever since -

549
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,759
- our first match. And now he's back.

550
00:46:04,366 --> 00:46:06,264
But he's not alone.

551
00:46:06,466 --> 00:46:09,262
Any last requests?

552
00:46:18,766 --> 00:46:20,732
There he is. Hey, Pharaoh!

553
00:46:23,299 --> 00:46:24,730
Where did he go?

554
00:46:29,566 --> 00:46:32,259
Hey, hold on!

555
00:46:33,265 --> 00:46:35,424
This isn't his room.

556
00:46:42,798 --> 00:46:45,356
Pharaoh. Oh, no.

557
00:46:49,032 --> 00:46:50,931
Who's there?

558
00:47:17,366 --> 00:47:20,594
- Yugi, you in here?
- Yugi?

559
00:47:23,898 --> 00:47:25,363
Hi.

560
00:47:26,631 --> 00:47:30,188
- Talk later. Run now.
- What's with him?

561
00:47:40,697 --> 00:47:43,755
Woaw, it looks like an
earthquake hit this place.

562
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:49,891
- And what in the world is that thing?
- That's what I wanna know.

563
00:47:50,498 --> 00:47:53,554
Mokuba. Is Yugi inside that thing?

564
00:47:53,765 --> 00:47:56,356
He's in there and so is my brother.

565
00:47:57,932 --> 00:48:01,365
- What is it?
- I don't know.

566
00:48:01,566 --> 00:48:06,463
Looks like that artifact we saw back at
the museum, only this one's super-sized.

567
00:48:06,666 --> 00:48:09,961
- But how is something like that possible?
- Anubis.

568
00:48:10,164 --> 00:48:14,120
- You don't think?
- Don't you remember the legend?

569
00:48:14,365 --> 00:48:18,923
Anubis once tried to destroy the world
using the power of the Pyramid of Light.

570
00:48:19,164 --> 00:48:22,358
The Pyramid of Light?
Wait, rewind a sec.

571
00:48:22,565 --> 00:48:25,656
All of this insanity started when
my brother played a card that -

572
00:48:25,865 --> 00:48:29,490
- was called the Pyramid of Light.
- Well, Yugi and Kaiba are inside something -

573
00:48:29,732 --> 00:48:31,755
- from 5000 years ago.

574
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:37,055
And if the myth is true then Anubis is
using it to finish was he started in the past.

575
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:40,787
This is crazy. We gotta get
them out of there.

576
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:44,720
I don't know what dark
powers are at work here -

577
00:48:44,931 --> 00:48:47,022
- but I can't let them go unchecked.

578
00:48:47,230 --> 00:48:51,129
I play Premature Burial to raise
Valkyria from the graveyard -

579
00:48:51,298 --> 00:48:54,525
- and I'll boost her strength
with Mage Power.

580
00:48:56,364 --> 00:48:59,091
It may cost me 800 life points, -

581
00:49:02,531 --> 00:49:06,520
- but my Valkyria now gains 500
attack and defence points

582
00:49:06,765 --> 00:49:11,390
- everytime I play a Magic or
Trap Card. Like these two.

583
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:18,724
1000 additional attack
points make my Valkyria -

584
00:49:18,932 --> 00:49:22,420
- more than a match for your
Blue-Eyes. Attack, Valkyria, -

585
00:49:22,697 --> 00:49:25,754
- with Mystic Sceptre Blast.

586
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:33,655
Not so fast, Yugi. Attack Guidance
Armor will save my Blue-Eyes.

587
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:40,058
- A trap.
- Very observant.

588
00:49:40,263 --> 00:49:43,128
Now your attack is diverted.

589
00:49:44,263 --> 00:49:47,128
And since my Deck Destruction
Virus is still in play -

590
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:50,092
- it infects ten more
cards in your deck.

591
00:49:58,063 --> 00:50:00,927
I've lost half the cards
in my deck already.

592
00:50:01,496 --> 00:50:05,054
Soon you'll lose them all. But first
I'll bring back an old friend -

593
00:50:05,263 --> 00:50:07,492
- who just hates to say goodbye.

594
00:50:11,931 --> 00:50:13,920
And next... -

595
00:50:15,031 --> 00:50:17,519
- I'm gonna summon up
your worst nightmare.

596
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:20,957
Because if you couldn't
defeat one Blue-Eyes... -

597
00:50:22,364 --> 00:50:25,228
- there's no way you'll
defeat three, -

598
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:31,056
- especially when combined as
the Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.

599
00:50:31,464 --> 00:50:36,453
If you think he's scary now, just wait
till he attacks. In fact don't wait.

600
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:40,859
Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon.
Neutron Blast.

601
00:50:55,396 --> 00:50:58,521
Look at the world's
best duelist now.

602
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:04,793
- Think we've lost them.
- So what, what are those freaks?

603
00:51:08,062 --> 00:51:10,290
Yugi, what the heck is going on?

604
00:51:10,563 --> 00:51:13,029
We've been drawn into
the Millennium Puzzle -

605
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,197
- and that thing up there is
somehow responsible.

606
00:51:15,663 --> 00:51:17,686
Then what's that, down there?

607
00:51:18,596 --> 00:51:22,188
That blue one looks like the Pyramid
of Light I saw at the museum.

608
00:51:22,731 --> 00:51:26,822
Yeah? Well it looks like it's beating the
crap out of your Millennium Puzzle.

609
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:30,087
Fighting pyramides and creepy
floating eyes. Wonderful.

610
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:33,319
- It's crazy.
- Hey. When you around with Yugi -

611
00:51:33,529 --> 00:51:37,859
- it's a path full of coarse.
- So, any idea what we're up against?

612
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:39,819
Maybe.

613
00:51:40,596 --> 00:51:44,323
I think this all has to do with
an ancient Egyptian sorceror.

614
00:51:44,564 --> 00:51:46,654
I knew it was gonna
be something insane.

615
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:49,986
He's called Anubis the
Egyptian Lord of the Dead.

616
00:51:50,229 --> 00:51:51,956
- Lord of the Dead?
- Yeah.

617
00:51:52,197 --> 00:51:55,629
Centuries ago he tried to destroy
the world and I'm starting to believe -

618
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,328
- he's trying to make a comeback.
- What?

619
00:51:58,496 --> 00:52:03,224
<i>The eye that sees what's yet
to come its vision shall be fulfilled -</i>

620
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,393
<i>- unless blinded by events
predetermined.</i>

621
00:52:06,562 --> 00:52:08,790
<i>Thus light and shadows
both be killed.</i>

622
00:52:13,062 --> 00:52:16,152
Doesn't look like the duel's going too
well for your friend the pharaoh.

623
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:19,989
Yeah, we got to do something to help him.
And all I can think of right now is -

624
00:52:20,196 --> 00:52:22,415
- to head back to Anubis' tomb.

625
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:26,128
- You mean back towards the mummies?
- Hey, come on. We already know -

626
00:52:26,329 --> 00:52:27,885
- we can outrun them.

627
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:42,457
Does it hurt Yugi? Because it
only gets worse from here.

628
00:52:43,629 --> 00:52:47,560
Kaiba, we can't continue this Duel.
There's another power at work here, -

629
00:52:47,730 --> 00:52:50,889
- and it's destroying us both.
- That's getting a bit old.

630
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:54,822
No. That Pyramid of Light has
created a deadly Shadow Game.

631
00:52:54,995 --> 00:52:58,222
I know you sense it we must stop now.

632
00:52:58,529 --> 00:53:01,437
The only thing I sense is your
fear. Not that I blame you.

633
00:53:01,438 --> 00:53:04,851
But I came here to win and
stopping's not an option.

634
00:53:05,162 --> 00:53:10,150
For all the times you humiliated me in a duel,
when clearly I should have been champion.

635
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:14,691
For all the times I'd had to listen to your
preach about the heart of the cards.

636
00:53:14,928 --> 00:53:19,827
You're going down, Yugi. And my Blue-Eyes
Ultimate Dragon is gonna put you there.

637
00:53:20,595 --> 00:53:25,995
Kaiba, once again your ridiculously
over-inflated ego blinds you to the truth.

638
00:53:26,196 --> 00:53:30,629
I am far from beaten.
I play Monster Reborn.

639
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:35,022
To bring back Dark Magician Girl.

640
00:53:40,995 --> 00:53:45,222
Next I reveal my face
down card, Sage's Stone.

641
00:53:45,395 --> 00:53:49,350
When Dark Magician Girl is on the
field and Sage's Stone is played, -

642
00:53:49,562 --> 00:53:52,653
- it allows me to automatically
summon Dark Magician.

643
00:53:54,928 --> 00:53:57,895
- Big deal.
- Oh, it's a very big deal.

644
00:53:58,162 --> 00:54:00,956
For now I sacrifice both magicians -

645
00:54:01,128 --> 00:54:04,720
- to summon the
Sorceror of Dark Magic.

646
00:54:08,061 --> 00:54:12,493
And with his rise to power comes
your Blue-Eyes far from grace.

647
00:54:12,728 --> 00:54:16,354
Because for everyone of my sorceror's
fallen comrades in the graveyard -

648
00:54:16,561 --> 00:54:19,789
- your dragon loses 500 points.

649
00:54:20,594 --> 00:54:24,822
And right now there have been
three magicians laid down to rest, -

650
00:54:24,994 --> 00:54:31,416
- so your precious Ultimate Dragon's
power decreases by 1500 points.

651
00:54:32,828 --> 00:54:36,851
But that means my Blue-Eyes Ultimate
Dragon is vulnerable to attack.

652
00:54:37,128 --> 00:54:42,527
That's exactly what it means.
Attack with Celestial Blast.

653
00:54:51,661 --> 00:54:53,684
Now, will you stop this madness?

654
00:54:53,928 --> 00:54:56,416
After one lucky move?
I don't think so.

655
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:03,955
Very well, Kaiba you leave me no choice.
I move to attack Peten the Dark Clown.

656
00:55:04,161 --> 00:55:08,593
No, I'll have no monsters on the
field to defend my life points.

657
00:55:08,828 --> 00:55:13,261
Sorcerer, Celestial Blast attack!

658
00:55:17,594 --> 00:55:19,389
You may have destroyed my
clown, but you forgot about -

659
00:55:19,594 --> 00:55:22,492
- Deck Virus Trap Card.

660
00:55:22,727 --> 00:55:28,284
And at a time when you couldn't afford to.
Your deck's about to be wiped out.

661
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:32,593
- What?
- Sorry, Kaiba...

662
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:35,989
But my Sorceror of Dark Magic
mystic's powers are so mighty, -

663
00:55:36,195 --> 00:55:40,184
- he can stop the activation of Trap Cards,
like your Deck Virus and destroy it.

664
00:55:40,428 --> 00:55:44,451
- My deck is safe.
- But your life points aren't.

665
00:55:49,361 --> 00:55:52,849
I activate the magic of
Monster Reborn.

666
00:55:53,561 --> 00:55:57,822
Then I sacrifice my reborned Ultimate
Dragon to summon a new monster.

667
00:55:58,061 --> 00:55:59,526
- What?
- That's right.

668
00:55:59,761 --> 00:56:04,819
You see I have an even more powerful
monster, compliments of Pegasus.

669
00:56:05,027 --> 00:56:10,755
A shiny new dragon.
The Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

670
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:30,555
Could it be? A card I'd
never seen before?

671
00:56:30,727 --> 00:56:32,955
And for every dragon in my graveyard -

672
00:56:33,193 --> 00:56:37,888
- the Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon gains
an additional 300 attack points.

673
00:56:38,427 --> 00:56:42,052
That's an extra 1500 attack points, -

674
00:56:42,260 --> 00:56:45,522
- for at punishing grand
total of 4500 points.

675
00:56:49,427 --> 00:56:52,587
But don't forget, due to
my sorceres' powers, -

676
00:56:52,827 --> 00:56:56,692
- your new dragon's attack
points decrease by 1500.

677
00:56:56,893 --> 00:57:01,655
I don't think so. Thanks to my
dragon's Shining Diffusion.

678
00:57:03,727 --> 00:57:05,523
What, your points didn't decrease.

679
00:57:05,727 --> 00:57:10,182
Exactly. That's because my Blue-Eyes Shining
Dragon allows me to choose which Magic Trap -

680
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:13,753
- or Monster Effect Cards
can be used against him.

681
00:57:14,227 --> 00:57:17,659
Just face it, Yugi, your days as
a champion duelist are over.

682
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:21,257
My Shining Dragon is gonna blast
you back to the minor leagues -

683
00:57:21,426 --> 00:57:22,756
- where you belong.

684
00:57:22,992 --> 00:57:27,890
Now, hit him again, Blue-Eyes.
Shining Neutron Blast.

685
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:49,494
How do you like it? The pain, the
sting of defeat. I felt it for too long.

686
00:57:52,194 --> 00:57:53,955
Now it's your turn.

687
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,255
You're sure this is the
way to that mummy guy?

688
00:58:02,460 --> 00:58:05,392
Yeah, every hallway
looks the same.

689
00:58:06,193 --> 00:58:08,386
- Hey, what's wrong, Yugi?
- It's weird.

690
00:58:08,593 --> 00:58:10,559
Suddenly I feel really weak, guys.

691
00:58:12,792 --> 00:58:16,088
Check it out. It's some
kind of energy stream.

692
00:58:16,593 --> 00:58:20,184
Maybe if we follow this thing,
it'll lead us to Anubis.

693
00:58:20,425 --> 00:58:23,255
Sounds like a plan, come on, pal.

694
00:58:33,359 --> 00:58:37,849
It's putting out energy waves that
are making my pacemaker go haywire.

695
00:58:58,193 --> 00:58:59,682
Up here!

696
00:59:02,692 --> 00:59:05,659
- I'd hurry up.
- Pegasus?

697
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,615
Pegasus, what are you doing here?

698
00:59:20,826 --> 00:59:23,791
How about we start with a
thank you, you little ingrate?

699
00:59:23,958 --> 00:59:28,288
If I hadn't figured out what this whole Pyramid
of Light things about, you'd all be crushed.

700
00:59:28,525 --> 00:59:32,651
You see, Kaiba thinks he got that card from me
when in fact this is all been arranged by an -

701
00:59:32,826 --> 00:59:36,518
- evil lord who tried to take over the
world five millennia ago and is now back -

702
00:59:36,759 --> 00:59:39,247
- to finish the job. I looked it up.

703
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:42,991
Now, this Anubis has created
the ultimate Shadow Game -

704
00:59:43,192 --> 00:59:47,284
- and he's getting stronger every moment.
- Then the prophecy is being fulfilled.

705
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:50,683
And Yugi and Kaiba are
right in the middle of it.

706
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:53,414
We just gotta find a
way to help them.

707
00:59:57,892 --> 01:00:00,585
- Looks like this is it.
- Yeah.

708
01:00:21,424 --> 01:00:26,119
<i>Foolish mortals there is nothing
you can do to stop my rebirth.</i>

709
01:00:26,292 --> 01:00:31,724
<i>I have infiltrated the realm of the
pharaoh and his life force now feeds mine.</i>

710
01:00:31,925 --> 01:00:35,879
We won't stand here while you suck
the life out of others to save yourself.

711
01:00:36,092 --> 01:00:40,388
- We're gonna take you down, Anubis.
- I'd stay in that casket if I were you.

712
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:44,217
Yeah, because just in case you haven't
noticed, we've got you outnumbered.

713
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:56,186
This place is crawling with stiffs.

714
01:01:00,558 --> 01:01:02,024
What do you want, anyway?

715
01:01:02,223 --> 01:01:07,681
<i>Behold the future since you won't
live to see it for yourself.</i>

716
01:01:09,424 --> 01:01:15,379
<i>Soon my beasts of destruction shall
annihilate all traces of life on Earth.</i>

717
01:01:15,591 --> 01:01:20,922
<i>And I will finally complete that
which I started millennia ago.</i>

718
01:01:23,624 --> 01:01:29,113
<i>It is by your very hand that this
devastation will occur, mortal.</i>

719
01:01:29,324 --> 01:01:33,950
<i>For when you released the
pharaoh, you released me as well.</i>

720
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:35,486
What's he mean?

721
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,486
This is between me and him.

722
01:01:37,657 --> 01:01:41,215
Listen, you guys need to find a way
outta this place and save yourselves.

723
01:01:41,424 --> 01:01:44,652
- I'm gonna stay here and figure this out.
- Figure what out?

724
01:01:44,857 --> 01:01:47,687
There was a prophecy my grandpa
read to me in the museum.

725
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:51,754
And I think it may have something to
do with this. I just don't know what.

726
01:01:51,957 --> 01:01:53,253
Yugi, that's crazy.

727
01:01:53,558 --> 01:01:54,682
Just go guys.

728
01:01:54,924 --> 01:01:58,186
Wait there's no way we're
leaving you, we're team.

729
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:02,449
We've been through everything together and
there's no chance we're turning our back on you now.

730
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,747
- That's right.
- But...

731
01:02:04,956 --> 01:02:08,684
The last thing I wanna do is
put my best friends in danger.

732
01:02:12,358 --> 01:02:16,414
What are you doing? Téa, please,
get down from there.

733
01:02:16,624 --> 01:02:19,385
My friends need me. I just know it.

734
01:02:22,590 --> 01:02:24,056
Foolish girl.

735
01:02:26,358 --> 01:02:29,346
Téa, come back in here at once.

736
01:02:29,825 --> 01:02:32,289
I've got to help my friends.

737
01:02:32,623 --> 01:02:35,020
- She's falling.
- Grab her.

738
01:02:49,091 --> 01:02:52,614
I'm coming, guys!

739
01:02:54,223 --> 01:02:56,689
- Téa.
- How did you find us?

740
01:02:56,890 --> 01:03:00,685
Are you kidding me? Remember
the friendship symbol we drew?

741
01:03:00,923 --> 01:03:03,889
- Of course we do.
- The ink may have fated but our -

742
01:03:04,090 --> 01:03:06,487
- bond never will.
- Right.

743
01:03:06,724 --> 01:03:11,053
We're all with you. And we're
always be with you.

744
01:03:11,789 --> 01:03:14,756
Thanks, guys. Friends till the end.

745
01:03:14,957 --> 01:03:16,422
- Yeah.
- Right.

746
01:03:17,290 --> 01:03:21,280
You see? There's nothing out there that's
more powerful than our friendship.

747
01:03:21,557 --> 01:03:25,750
Téa is right. I can feel it. All we
have to do is stick together.

748
01:03:25,990 --> 01:03:28,387
Hey, stick it together,
is what we do best.

749
01:03:28,623 --> 01:03:30,589
We'll never leave your side.

750
01:03:31,423 --> 01:03:34,287
<i>- Téa.
- Your pathetic little bond -</i>

751
01:03:34,456 --> 01:03:36,616
<i>- is nothing against my power.</i>

752
01:03:36,823 --> 01:03:42,483
<i>Soon my soul will be fully restored
and your world shrouded in darkness.</i>

753
01:03:42,724 --> 01:03:46,019
<i>Yet, you fools prate along
about togetherness?</i>

754
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:50,546
<i>- Then so be it.
- Téa!</i>

755
01:03:54,023 --> 01:03:56,420
- Téa!
- What's out!

756
01:04:01,656 --> 01:04:03,519
What? I can do that.

757
01:04:10,756 --> 01:04:13,722
- Let's take them apart.
- Literally.

758
01:04:13,922 --> 01:04:17,752
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Johnny Rotten. Over here.

759
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,388
Take this.

760
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:26,215
That wasn't suppose to happen.

761
01:04:26,756 --> 01:04:29,881
- Tristan.
- Kicks to the stomach don't work.

762
01:04:30,089 --> 01:04:32,056
Neither do kicks to the head.

763
01:04:33,056 --> 01:04:35,385
Let's try this.

764
01:04:36,623 --> 01:04:38,145
These carcasses won't quit.

765
01:04:38,423 --> 01:04:41,184
How do you destroy
what's already dead?

766
01:04:43,723 --> 01:04:46,655
It's no use. They just keep coming.

767
01:04:55,989 --> 01:04:58,045
How the mighty has fallen.

768
01:04:58,255 --> 01:05:02,051
Lying there on the ground like a dog
waiting to be put out of it's misery.

769
01:05:02,255 --> 01:05:06,415
Get up, get up so I can
knock you back down.

770
01:05:08,055 --> 01:05:11,249
Something's not right here,
Kaiba, and you know it.

771
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:14,546
Spare me the mystic mumbojumbo.
You just can't stand that your -

772
01:05:14,788 --> 01:05:19,744
- reputation's at stake.
- You have no idea what's at stake here.

773
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:24,115
But believe me, I cannot
let you win this duel.

774
01:05:26,156 --> 01:05:29,144
Big Shield Gardna. Defence mode.

775
01:05:29,422 --> 01:05:33,718
You know I think you're the one who doesn't
have clue what this match is really about.

776
01:05:33,922 --> 01:05:35,912
It's about pay back.

777
01:05:39,122 --> 01:05:41,451
And this card will see to that.

778
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:47,813
But first let's deal with your
so-called Big Shield Gardna.

779
01:05:48,055 --> 01:05:51,053
Do you think it's big enough
to block the power of -

780
01:05:51,054 --> 01:05:54,110
-  Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon?

781
01:05:57,922 --> 01:06:01,649
Hey, look. Joey and Tristan.
We gotta get down there.

782
01:06:02,555 --> 01:06:06,816
Shining Dragon attack with
Shining Neutron Blast.

783
01:06:17,254 --> 01:06:19,379
I told you when we started this duel -

784
01:06:19,588 --> 01:06:22,145
- that this time things were
gonna be different, Yugi.

785
01:06:22,388 --> 01:06:24,684
You may have beaten
me in the past, -

786
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:28,787
- but now there's nothing you can do
to stop me from having my revenge.

787
01:06:28,987 --> 01:06:30,748
You're finished.

788
01:06:31,121 --> 01:06:33,088
Not yet. I'm not.

789
01:06:35,055 --> 01:06:39,180
I activate Pot of Greed which
let's me draw two cards.

790
01:06:43,521 --> 01:06:45,817
Now I summon Watapon
in defense mode.

791
01:06:46,055 --> 01:06:48,714
And since I used Pot of
Greed to play Watapon -

792
01:06:48,955 --> 01:06:51,477
- I can summon another
monster to the field.

793
01:06:51,722 --> 01:06:55,848
And I choose Obnoxious Celtic
Guardian. It's your move.

794
01:06:56,088 --> 01:06:58,384
So let me see if I've
got this right, now.

795
01:06:58,588 --> 01:07:01,348
Your playing a cream puff and an elf.

796
01:07:01,588 --> 01:07:03,713
Well, then it's your funeral.

797
01:07:03,955 --> 01:07:08,750
First the Card of Demise I played before
sends this dragon to the graveyard.

798
01:07:08,955 --> 01:07:11,351
And I know you know what
that means, don't you?

799
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,510
Now my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon has
more destructive power than ever before.

800
01:07:15,721 --> 01:07:17,688
Kaiba, please listen to me.

801
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:22,217
All I wanna hear from you is
your anguished cry of defeat.

802
01:07:22,921 --> 01:07:26,978
Kaiba, for the last time,
I'm begging you to stop this.

803
01:07:27,554 --> 01:07:30,520
People are getting hurt,
lives are in danger.

804
01:07:30,721 --> 01:07:34,949
And this Pyramid of Light you've
created is source of it all.

805
01:07:35,387 --> 01:07:38,286
There's a dark power in our
midst and you can't deny it.

806
01:07:38,455 --> 01:07:42,887
With every life point lost, we both
become weaker. I know you can feel it.

807
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,487
We must stop. Before it's too late.

808
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:50,517
<i>Ridiculous. I can attack Yugi
now with my Shining Dragon -</i>

809
01:07:50,688 --> 01:07:53,119
<i>- and destroy the rest
of his life points.</i>

810
01:07:53,288 --> 01:07:55,686
<i>No, I should stick to
my original strategy -</i>

811
01:07:55,887 --> 01:07:59,080
<i>- and defeat Yugi with his
very own Egyptian God Cards.</i>

812
01:07:59,354 --> 01:08:02,321
I'm afraid that for you
it's already too late, Yugi.

813
01:08:02,588 --> 01:08:07,145
No, Kaiba. Please you mustn't do this
we still have time to stop this madness.

814
01:08:07,354 --> 01:08:09,650
All we have to do is end this duel.

815
01:08:09,854 --> 01:08:14,718
You know, Yugi, you're absolutely right.
Stopping the duel is exactly what I'm gonna do.

816
01:08:14,921 --> 01:08:18,784
Now, Shining Blue-Eyes activate
your final special ability.

817
01:08:19,021 --> 01:08:22,748
No, you're playing with forces
you can't possibly understand.

818
01:08:23,021 --> 01:08:25,009
<i>Finish him. Finish him, now!</i>

819
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:28,311
<i>No, I wanted a perfect victory,
and with this card I can -</i>

820
01:08:28,554 --> 01:08:31,986
<i>- use Yugi's own most
powerful monsters against him.</i>

821
01:08:32,253 --> 01:08:35,014
I use Shining Nova.

822
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:38,549
It puts the rage of 1000 Blue-Eyes
into a blast so strong it -

823
01:08:38,720 --> 01:08:41,550
- destroys itself plus
anything I choose.

824
01:08:41,786 --> 01:08:45,220
And the card that will feel the wrath
of my Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon -

825
01:08:45,388 --> 01:08:46,853
- is the Pyramid of Light.

826
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:49,576
<i>No, I need the pyramid
to destroy the pharaoh.</i>

827
01:08:49,787 --> 01:08:54,117
<i>What am I saying? I must destroy
it to gain control of Yugi's God Cards.</i>

828
01:08:55,021 --> 01:08:57,486
Your reign as the King
of Games is over.

829
01:08:57,654 --> 01:09:02,279
That title will be mine as will all
three of your Egyptian God Cards.

830
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,315
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon
sacrifice yourself -

831
01:09:05,520 --> 01:09:08,008
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.

832
01:09:22,519 --> 01:09:24,917
<i>This I cannot allow.</i>

833
01:09:25,187 --> 01:09:27,675
What? The Pyramid of Light
wasn't destroyed?

834
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:34,046
<i>The Pyramid of Light endures because
I will it, so great is my power.</i>

835
01:09:34,287 --> 01:09:37,309
Hey, what is this? Show yourself,
whoever you are.

836
01:09:37,585 --> 01:09:41,848
<i>I have been here the whole time,
mortal, whispering in your ear.</i>

837
01:09:42,086 --> 01:09:45,382
The whole time? No.
This is some sort of trick.

838
01:09:45,985 --> 01:09:48,282
Kaiba. Look out!

839
01:09:54,419 --> 01:09:55,908
Kaiba. No!

840
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,881
You have served
me well, little worm, -

841
01:09:59,087 --> 01:10:02,644
- but you have outlived
your usefulness.

842
01:10:18,653 --> 01:10:22,745
So it's been you behind this whole
duel, manipulating Kaiba all along.

843
01:10:22,952 --> 01:10:25,851
The Egyptian Lord of
the Dead, Anubis.

844
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:30,349
I am pleased that you remember me
after all these years, my pharaoh.

845
01:10:30,519 --> 01:10:33,814
It will make my ultimate
vengence all the more sweeter.

846
01:10:34,086 --> 01:10:38,178
You will fall and my reign of
destruction shall begin.

847
01:10:38,585 --> 01:10:41,575
- We'll see.
- The souls of your mortal friends -

848
01:10:41,785 --> 01:10:44,808
- have already fallen, trapped
within your puzzle.

849
01:10:45,052 --> 01:10:48,678
- My friends?
- Lost in a labyrinth of the dead.

850
01:10:48,885 --> 01:10:51,544
You're wrong. I can still
sense their presence.

851
01:10:51,785 --> 01:10:53,774
And I will fight to defend them.

852
01:10:54,052 --> 01:10:58,542
No matter what happens, I will not let
your evil plan come to pass, Anubis.

853
01:10:58,786 --> 01:11:02,116
All I need due is defeat
you in this duel.

854
01:11:02,287 --> 01:11:06,581
And the prophecy will be fulfilled.
You will be destroyed.

855
01:11:06,752 --> 01:11:10,446
The magic of the Shadow Games that
you locked away centuries ago -

856
01:11:10,619 --> 01:11:13,244
- will once again be unleashed
into the world.

857
01:11:13,419 --> 01:11:17,942
And I shall finally take my rightful place,
as the pharaoh of this realm.

858
01:11:18,353 --> 01:11:20,751
With the Pyramid of Light
at my command -

859
01:11:21,218 --> 01:11:23,707
- there's nothing you
can do to stop me.

860
01:11:24,819 --> 01:11:29,377
The ultimate Shadow
Game is just beginning.

861
01:11:51,085 --> 01:11:57,450
I summon the terrible beasts,
Andro Sphinx and Sphinx Teleia.

862
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:08,774
<i>Reverse of Reverse.</i>

863
01:12:10,152 --> 01:12:13,515
Search your deck from
now until doomsday.

864
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:18,583
And you still won't find anything to stand
against my savage Shadow Realm beasts.

865
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:23,684
No, my pharaoh, I'm afraid that
for you doomsday is today.

866
01:12:27,186 --> 01:12:31,776
Now watch as your last line of defense
is ripped to shreds before your eyes.

867
01:12:31,985 --> 01:12:35,507
Sphinx Teleia, it is feeding time.

868
01:12:41,484 --> 01:12:43,246
My Celtic Guardian. No.

869
01:12:43,418 --> 01:12:47,213
And now it is your turn,
Andro Sphinx.

870
01:12:51,851 --> 01:12:54,874
Each time Andro Sphinx destroys a monster -

871
01:12:55,085 --> 01:12:58,051
- half of that monster's attack
points are taken away -

872
01:12:58,217 --> 01:13:03,115
- from my opponent's life points.
You have only 100 points left.

873
01:13:03,384 --> 01:13:05,181
- Oh, no.
- Yugi.

874
01:13:08,618 --> 01:13:13,915
Your fate is sealed, pharaoh. Soon
you will be the relic burried away.

875
01:13:14,118 --> 01:13:19,278
Soon worms will feast on your flesh,
just as they did on mine.

876
01:13:19,819 --> 01:13:25,910
Your worms will have to wait, Anubis.
I trust my fate to the heart of the cards.

877
01:13:26,251 --> 01:13:29,239
No monsters. Just two Magic Cards.

878
01:13:31,517 --> 01:13:34,415
That's all I have left.

879
01:13:38,718 --> 01:13:41,878
- He's all yours.
- I don't want you mummy.

880
01:13:43,117 --> 01:13:46,379
That eye up there seems
to be his power source.

881
01:13:47,017 --> 01:13:49,245
Hey, hold on. The prophecy.

882
01:13:49,417 --> 01:13:53,213
The eye that sees whats yet to come.
Its vision shall be fulfilled -

883
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:56,009
- unless blinded by events
predetermined.

884
01:13:56,217 --> 01:13:59,240
Predetermined events is just
another way of saying fate.

885
01:13:59,451 --> 01:14:02,246
The prophecy means the eye
can be blinded by fate.

886
01:14:03,017 --> 01:14:05,380
Heads up, you freak!

887
01:14:06,883 --> 01:14:08,974
The prophecy, I think
I have figured it out.

888
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:12,046
- All right. The way is to use your head.
- We'll see.

889
01:14:12,218 --> 01:14:15,843
If I'm right I gotta find
that Dagger of Fate.

890
01:14:18,917 --> 01:14:22,248
Yugi, please hurry!

891
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:27,180
It's empty. Please be in
here somewhere. Yes.

892
01:14:30,251 --> 01:14:31,875
Here it is.

893
01:14:32,117 --> 01:14:35,709
Let's just hope that
fate is on our side.

894
01:14:37,450 --> 01:14:39,076
Come on!

895
01:14:40,117 --> 01:14:42,413
No!

896
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:53,682
<i>A weakness in the Pyramid's power.</i>

897
01:14:55,617 --> 01:14:57,048
I activate Double Spell.

898
01:14:57,250 --> 01:15:00,238
By discarding one card from my
hand, I can select a new one -

899
01:15:00,450 --> 01:15:03,746
- from my opponent's graveyard.
And use it as my own.

900
01:15:06,016 --> 01:15:09,278
And I know just the card I want.

901
01:15:14,416 --> 01:15:16,041
Monster Reborn.

902
01:15:16,249 --> 01:15:20,273
So come forth, mighty
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

903
01:15:26,784 --> 01:15:31,341
And I have a hunch this time, your
pyramid won't be able to stand up to it.

904
01:15:31,583 --> 01:15:33,174
Go, Shining Nova.

905
01:15:33,483 --> 01:15:37,677
Use all your power to finish
what you started before -

906
01:15:37,883 --> 01:15:40,747
- and destroy the Pyramid of Light.

907
01:15:46,050 --> 01:15:47,811
Impossible.

908
01:16:32,216 --> 01:16:36,649
And with that I'll end my turn, now
that the Pyramid of Light is gone.

909
01:16:36,850 --> 01:16:40,907
Your opponent tried and failed to
destroy the pyramid with that dragon.

910
01:16:41,383 --> 01:16:43,315
You alone couldn't make
such a difference.

911
01:16:43,483 --> 01:16:46,381
You're quite right that I could
not have done it all alone.

912
01:16:46,583 --> 01:16:48,946
You may have destroyed
the card, pharaoh, -

913
01:16:49,149 --> 01:16:54,411
- but not the Pyramid of Light around
my neck. Behold its power.

914
01:16:55,981 --> 01:17:01,415
Inspired by your modern sayings:
Two heads are better than one.

915
01:17:03,182 --> 01:17:06,808
Thenien the Great Sphinx.

916
01:17:09,216 --> 01:17:15,636
And now, Pyramid of Light, feed this
perfect beast with Dead Souls Set Free.

917
01:17:26,582 --> 01:17:30,947
Hey look. Tell me that
attack meter is broke.

918
01:17:31,383 --> 01:17:34,281
Say hello, Thenien.

919
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:40,208
5000 years ago, I
never had the chance -

920
01:17:40,416 --> 01:17:42,540
- to summon Thenien to our battle.

921
01:17:42,716 --> 01:17:46,171
So I think it'd be best if
we made up for lost time -

922
01:17:46,382 --> 01:17:48,814
- and finally had a
proper introduction.

923
01:17:48,981 --> 01:17:53,573
Thenien, meet the pharaoh,
and pharaoh meet your doom.

924
01:17:54,614 --> 01:17:56,807
<i>We don't have anything
that can beat that sphinx.</i>

925
01:17:57,049 --> 01:18:01,606
<i>Yes, we do, Yugi. If I'm correct
about what Kaiba was planning.</i>

926
01:18:02,049 --> 01:18:03,911
Now Anubis, this is still a duel -

927
01:18:04,082 --> 01:18:07,049
- and I still have one face
down card to play.

928
01:18:07,248 --> 01:18:08,578
Reverse of Reverse, -

929
01:18:08,749 --> 01:18:13,113
- which allows me to use the
last card played by Kaiba:

930
01:18:15,048 --> 01:18:17,707
Return from the Different Dimension.

931
01:18:17,915 --> 01:18:20,745
When Kaiba spoke of dealing
me the perfect defeat, -

932
01:18:20,915 --> 01:18:24,903
- he meant wiping me out
with my own Egyptian Gods.

933
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:33,114
Allow me to introduce Obelisk
the Tormentor, Slifer the Sky Dragon -

934
01:18:33,381 --> 01:18:35,315
- and The Winged Dragon of Ra.

935
01:18:35,482 --> 01:18:41,880
My Egyptian Gods, combine
now! For infinite power.

936
01:18:56,648 --> 01:19:00,137
Now go, Titan Firestorm!

937
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:22,870
No.

938
01:19:27,513 --> 01:19:29,605
- Yeah, Yugi!
- All right!

939
01:19:29,814 --> 01:19:31,837
Yeah!

940
01:19:42,981 --> 01:19:45,879
- You did it.
- We did it.

941
01:19:53,780 --> 01:19:57,338
Kaiba. Are you all right?

942
01:19:57,614 --> 01:20:00,137
Let me help you.

943
01:20:00,348 --> 01:20:02,644
I can take care of myself.

944
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:15,008
What the...?

945
01:20:16,780 --> 01:20:20,769
<i>Shadows take life.
Creatures be born.</i>

946
01:20:20,980 --> 01:20:26,412
<i>Now let see how well you play this game,
when the monsters are real.</i>

947
01:20:27,081 --> 01:20:29,342
- Monsters?
- For real?

948
01:20:29,547 --> 01:20:35,208
<i>It is no longer time to duel.
Now it is time to die.</i>

949
01:20:49,214 --> 01:20:53,670
<i>Nothing in your decks of
cards can save you now.</i>

950
01:21:01,480 --> 01:21:04,913
<i>It appears you are one
card short, pharaoh.</i>

951
01:21:05,113 --> 01:21:07,478
Yeah, but I'm not.

952
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:12,937
Attack! Gilford the Lightning
and Gearfried the Iron Knight.

953
01:21:13,181 --> 01:21:15,669
<i>Begone!</i>

954
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:28,973
<i>You have no concept of my powers
and now the end begins.</i>

955
01:21:38,846 --> 01:21:41,311
We're pancakes.

956
01:21:43,647 --> 01:21:45,306
Not yet.

957
01:21:46,746 --> 01:21:48,712
These Toon Monsters
won't last long.

958
01:21:48,945 --> 01:21:51,913
We have to get out of here,
while we still have the chance.

959
01:21:52,113 --> 01:21:54,012
Yugi, I know you'll take
this creep down.

960
01:21:54,213 --> 01:21:56,872
Yes, you would, 'cause we will
be with you all the way.

961
01:21:57,081 --> 01:21:59,137
- Always.
- Always.

962
01:22:01,814 --> 01:22:04,110
Fine, fine. Let's go, already.

963
01:22:29,112 --> 01:22:31,578
How can we beat a real monster?

964
01:22:32,080 --> 01:22:34,409
How? With a real monster.

965
01:22:34,579 --> 01:22:36,977
- Yugi.
- What's this?

966
01:22:37,212 --> 01:22:39,871
The one card that can beat him.

967
01:22:40,045 --> 01:22:43,206
It's time to get real with a
Blue-Eyes Shining Dragon.

968
01:22:48,346 --> 01:22:50,141
- Shining Nova, attack!
- Shining Nova, attack!

969
01:22:50,446 --> 01:22:53,241
If the monsters are real,
so are all their powers -

970
01:22:53,412 --> 01:22:57,277
- including this dragon's ability
to destroy any monster.

971
01:23:04,246 --> 01:23:06,336
Destroy Anubis!

972
01:23:11,479 --> 01:23:14,377
Wow, check it out.

973
01:23:18,979 --> 01:23:20,638
No!

974
01:24:26,878 --> 01:24:29,140
He's not coming back again, right?

975
01:24:30,245 --> 01:24:34,677
We should take a closer look at that prophecy
to see what it foretells for the future.

976
01:24:34,845 --> 01:24:37,402
Oh please, old man. Anubis is gone.

977
01:24:37,645 --> 01:24:41,940
No one could return after suffering a
defeat so thoroughly devastating as that.

978
01:24:42,145 --> 01:24:44,906
Well. No one but Kaiba, that is.

979
01:24:45,145 --> 01:24:48,077
- I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?
- Kaiba.

980
01:24:48,244 --> 01:24:51,438
Oh, please, spare me all your
bull about friendship, will ya?

981
01:24:51,678 --> 01:24:54,508
If it wasn't for that freak crashing
the party we both know that -

982
01:24:54,712 --> 01:24:57,678
- the winner of todays duel
would have been me.

983
01:24:57,878 --> 01:25:01,639
So enjoy your last days of being
champion. Why you still can.

984
01:25:01,911 --> 01:25:04,604
I gotta say it's nice to
have the old Kaiba back.

985
01:25:04,844 --> 01:25:09,335
Yeah? Well this conversation's
over. We'll duel again.

986
01:25:10,578 --> 01:25:12,544
Wait up!

987
01:25:13,912 --> 01:25:17,538
I'm sure glad he didn't bring up all
the damage you did to the Duel Dome.

988
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,108
'Cause I don't think his
insurance is gonna cover this.

989
01:25:20,311 --> 01:25:23,765
He's got plenty of money, Grandpa.
But what he doesn't have is one of these.

990
01:25:23,978 --> 01:25:27,273
And unless he changes he won't
have best friends like this.

991
01:25:27,545 --> 01:25:30,010
What Kaiba doesn't get is
that victory means nothing, -

992
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:32,836
- unless you can share it
with the people you love.

993
01:25:33,011 --> 01:25:35,375
'Cause then...

994
01:25:35,678 --> 01:25:37,405
You're really a winner.

995
01:25:37,611 --> 01:25:39,440
You can say that again.

996
