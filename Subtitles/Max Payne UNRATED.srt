<i>I don't believe in heaven.</i>

3
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:33,562
<i>I believe in pain.</i>

4
00:00:34,697 --> 00:00:36,665
<i>I believe in fear.</i>

5
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:39,907
<i>I believe in death.</i>

6
00:00:58,354 --> 00:01:00,822
<i>There's an army of bodies</i>
<i>under this river...</i>

7
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:05,623
<i>criminals, people who ran</i>
<i>out of time, out of friends.</i>

8
00:01:15,138 --> 00:01:19,507
<i>Next time they drag this river, they'll find
me on the bottom with the rest of them.</i>

9
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>There won't be anyone left</i>
<i>to say I was different.</i>

10
00:01:39,295 --> 00:01:41,320
<i>I could feel the dead</i>
<i>down in there...</i>

11
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:43,422
<i>just below my feet...</i>

12
00:01:43,533 --> 00:01:46,366
<i>reaching up to welcome me</i>
<i>as one of their own.</i>

13
00:01:50,206 --> 00:01:52,538
<i>It was an easy mistake to make.</i>

14
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:12,291
<i>All the cold investigations</i>
<i>in the city are collected up...</i>

15
00:02:12,395 --> 00:02:14,659
and delivered over here to us.

16
00:02:14,764 --> 00:02:19,701
We call each of the witnesses to see if they have
anything to add to their original statements.

17
00:02:19,802 --> 00:02:22,367
And if they can?

18
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,933
We send the file to the original
precinct for follow-up.

19
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:29,501
Don't get your hopes up though.

20
00:02:34,717 --> 00:02:36,617
This is the Cold Case office.

21
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:40,849
Once you've been through the file
and come up empty, you bring it here.

22
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:44,120
<i>Max here handles all our files.</i>

23
00:02:44,227 --> 00:02:47,822
It hits his desk,
the case is officially dead.

24
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:49,899
So what if there's no phone number
for a witness?

25
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:52,968
- Should I follow-up in person?
- No, no. We don't do that kind of stuff down here.

26
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:54,661
I don't understand. Then how...

27
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:58,263
How am I supposed to solve the unsolvable
murder mystery and redeem yourself?

28
00:02:58,374 --> 00:03:02,037
<i>- Man, Internal Affairs-</i>
<i>- Look, look, stop. All right, trust me.</i>

29
00:03:02,145 --> 00:03:07,208
There's a tragic story behind why
I'm standin' here givin' you this tour.

30
00:03:07,317 --> 00:03:10,115
We all did something,
so just save it.

31
00:03:15,491 --> 00:03:17,925
What do you say we grab a beer
after work or something?

32
00:03:27,937 --> 00:03:30,428
- So what's his story?
- There is none.

33
00:03:31,474 --> 00:03:33,465
- But back there you said-
- Listen.

34
00:03:33,576 --> 00:03:38,138
His wife and kid were murdered.
They never found the guy.

35
00:03:38,247 --> 00:03:40,909
That's his story.

36
00:03:41,017 --> 00:03:46,011
Remember when you were a kid and you'd hold
your breath when you went past a graveyard?

37
00:03:46,122 --> 00:03:49,057
Just leave that man alone.

38
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:40,267
Yo, homey,
that's a really nice watch.

39
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:43,532
Kinda reminds me of one I lost.

40
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,834
Oh, you didn't lose it. You pawned it
up on 128th a few hours ago.

41
00:05:51,214 --> 00:05:53,512
Ask Doug. He was there with you.

42
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,620
Are you followin' us, asshole?

43
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:01,622
No.

44
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:05,686
I'm only following you.

45
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:08,730
Hell, no.
What, you a cop or somethin'?

46
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:13,367
Not tonight.

47
00:06:13,469 --> 00:06:16,836
That's too bad.
Now go get my watch.

48
00:06:18,908 --> 00:06:22,742
Come on, Dougie.
Come get his watch.

49
00:06:30,286 --> 00:06:33,255
I guess this ain't
your lucky day, now, is it?

50
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:55,873
No! No! No!

51
00:07:04,854 --> 00:07:06,754
<i>Watch over me. Watch over me.</i>

52
00:07:06,856 --> 00:07:08,517
Watch over me. Watch over me.

53
00:07:08,624 --> 00:07:10,717
- Watch over me. Watch over me.
- Open your eyes. Now!

54
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:13,693
- Oh, Jesus.
- Have you ever seen this woman?

55
00:07:15,031 --> 00:07:17,465
- No.
- You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey...

56
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,467
with William Preston
six months ago.

57
00:07:19,569 --> 00:07:23,130
- Bill's dead.
- Why the hell do you think I'm talkin' to you?

58
00:07:23,239 --> 00:07:24,655
Did you ever hear anyone say
anything about this woman?

59
00:07:24,656 --> 00:07:26,072
Bill died...

60
00:07:26,175 --> 00:07:28,075
Bill died 'cause their wings
couldn't lift him up.

61
00:07:28,177 --> 00:07:31,271
No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
What are you talking about?

62
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,143
Their wings are gold, Max.
They just look black. Feathers...

63
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:34,907
Get up!

64
00:08:27,721 --> 00:08:29,655
- All right. All right.
- Hey, buddy.

65
00:08:31,483 --> 00:08:32,711
Man, I told you not to come here.

66
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:36,319
William Preston was a dead end.

67
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,981
I am done helping you, Max.

68
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:42,526
I paid my debt to society,
you know?

69
00:08:42,627 --> 00:08:45,858
I... I've cooperated enough, man.

70
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,989
Okay?

71
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:49,999
What's goin' on in there?

72
00:08:50,101 --> 00:08:52,331
What? It's a dinner party.
Okay?

73
00:08:52,437 --> 00:08:54,496
I'm a little offended
I didn't get my invitation.

74
00:08:54,606 --> 00:08:58,736
I didn't send out invita-
Look, I told you. Go find Bill's partner.

75
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:01,334
I did. Dougie only wanted to talk
about birds or something.

76
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:03,607
He was a whack job.
Now I need a new name.

77
00:09:03,715 --> 00:09:05,706
- Well, I'm outta ideas then!
- Hey, baby.

78
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:08,650
- Okay. What-Not now, bitch!
- Asshole!

79
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:12,484
Look, okay? I told you.
I don't know those kinds of people now.

80
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,615
<i>I've moved up in the world, Max.</i>

81
00:09:14,726 --> 00:09:17,718
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah. Th-Th-This is a dinner party.

82
00:09:17,829 --> 00:09:20,525
<i>All right? These are my friends.</i>
<i>Do you remember friends?</i>

83
00:09:20,632 --> 00:09:23,192
Listen. If you don't give me a new name...

84
00:09:23,301 --> 00:09:25,895
I'm gonna start frisking
every one of your friends.

85
00:09:26,004 --> 00:09:28,837
<i>Three years on the street</i>
<i>is a lifetime, man.</i>

86
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,932
<i>Whoever you're lookin' for,</i>
<i>there's no way they are still out there.</i>

87
00:09:32,043 --> 00:09:34,671
You're chasing ghosts, Max. God!

88
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:38,510
You try sleeping once in a while,
you could see that for yourself.

89
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:40,880
I thought I knew
all of Trevor's friends.

90
00:09:42,287 --> 00:09:44,949
Max, Natasha. Natasha, Max.

91
00:09:45,056 --> 00:09:47,422
Jesus Christ!

92
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:50,426
- Got a light?
- I don't smoke.

93
00:09:52,597 --> 00:09:55,259
- That's interesting.
- What?

94
00:09:55,366 --> 00:09:57,425
Your tattoo.
That's interesting.

95
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,265
Oh, thank you.

96
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:11,641
I don't know him. Okay?

97
00:10:12,684 --> 00:10:14,584
- Shit.
- What?

98
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,923
<i>Stay back! What are you doing here?</i>

99
00:10:22,026 --> 00:10:23,823
- You can't keep following me around.
<i>- Come with me.</i>

100
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:26,453
- Hey!
- Mind your own business.

101
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:27,929
<i>You have no right to be here!</i>

102
00:10:28,032 --> 00:10:29,659
Yeah?

103
00:10:29,768 --> 00:10:33,101
<i>I'm clean.</i>
<i>I'm not doing anything wrong.</i>

104
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:35,172
- Da?
- Da.

105
00:10:35,273 --> 00:10:38,242
Hey! Why don't you relax?

106
00:10:39,344 --> 00:10:42,836
It's a party. Have a drink.

107
00:10:42,947 --> 00:10:45,609
<i>Just stop it.</i>
<i>These are new friends.</i>

108
00:10:46,851 --> 00:10:48,682
<i>I don't see the others anymore!</i>

109
00:10:50,054 --> 00:10:51,078
<i>He's a cop.</i>

110
00:10:51,189 --> 00:10:54,090
<i>How much trouble can I get in?</i>

111
00:11:05,236 --> 00:11:09,104
My sister. Sort of a bitch.

112
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:12,108
- Hey, Max! Max.
- What are you doing?

113
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:14,110
You have to go. Okay? Now.

114
00:11:14,212 --> 00:11:16,442
I need to
ask her something first.

115
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:20,317
Oh, Jesus Christ.

116
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,911
There you are.

117
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,511
Where'd you go?

118
00:12:56,623 --> 00:13:00,184
Take me somewhere. I'll tell you.

119
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:04,253
See you around, Lupino.

120
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,477
Hey.

121
00:13:59,586 --> 00:14:02,453
Easy.

122
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:07,625
You just move in?

123
00:14:07,727 --> 00:14:10,287
So we're somewhere.

124
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,991
What was goin' on
in that room back there?

125
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:19,225
Hey!

126
00:14:21,365 --> 00:14:23,925
Who was the guy
with the tattoos on his face?

127
00:14:37,748 --> 00:14:39,682
Fine. What was her name?

128
00:14:40,784 --> 00:14:42,684
What are you talkin' about?
Who?

129
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:46,586
The girl from the boring story
you want to tell me...

130
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:49,181
the one that ends
with you living here.

131
00:14:49,293 --> 00:14:51,921
Very sad.

132
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:56,693
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>Call me by her name.</i>

133
00:14:58,235 --> 00:15:01,796
Like this you can make love to her
just like she never left you.

134
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,673
Oh, Max. I miss you.

135
00:15:10,113 --> 00:15:12,013
Get out.

136
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,213
- Excuse me?
- I said, get out now.

137
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,820
You're kicking <i>me</i>
out of your bed?

138
00:15:23,927 --> 00:15:26,589
Yeah.
Get your shit and get out.

139
00:15:55,892 --> 00:15:57,792
This is Owen. Leave a message.

140
00:15:57,894 --> 00:16:01,159
Owen, it's Natasha.

141
00:16:02,766 --> 00:16:05,166
Where's Lupino?
I need some more stuff.

142
00:16:05,268 --> 00:16:08,362
Yeah. Call me. Okay?

143
00:16:59,389 --> 00:17:00,879
No!

144
00:17:00,991 --> 00:17:03,653
No, not yet! Not yet! Not yet!

145
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:03,383
- What?
- Look. Jump in, will you?

146
00:18:15,832 --> 00:18:19,529
- Where are we going?
- I need you to look at something.

147
00:18:23,874 --> 00:18:26,206
What about cameras?
Security cameras anywhere?

148
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:28,573
There's got to be somebody
who saw something.

149
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,683
Time of death is?

150
00:18:37,087 --> 00:18:39,351
We got body parts.

151
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,256
<i>- They're already canvassing.</i>
- What happened to them?

152
00:18:44,361 --> 00:18:47,194
Her. Just one.

153
00:18:51,568 --> 00:18:54,765
I don't believe it.

154
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:58,500
What, are you two back together?
Did you kiss and make up?

155
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:01,168
Where are we on the weapon?

156
00:19:01,278 --> 00:19:04,008
We're nowhere yet.
I mean, looks like a blade...

157
00:19:04,114 --> 00:19:07,914
but too much blood
for that to be right.

158
00:19:08,018 --> 00:19:11,249
Hey, O'Brien! Just a sec. Hey, listen.

159
00:19:11,354 --> 00:19:15,017
- Why are you showing me this?
- We found this here.

160
00:19:18,261 --> 00:19:20,058
Did you know her, Max?

161
00:19:38,048 --> 00:19:39,948
It's Natasha.

162
00:19:42,385 --> 00:19:44,615
Let's take a ride.

163
00:19:44,721 --> 00:19:47,747
<i>Folks, we need you</i>
<i>to move back, please.</i>

164
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:14,648
- What are we doing here?
- We're getting a beer, right?

165
00:20:16,553 --> 00:20:19,181
You'd rather do this
in the street?

166
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:24,625
Fine. You were with the victim last night.
Your wallet was found in the alley.

167
00:20:24,728 --> 00:20:27,925
If you don't wanna talk to me, they're gonna
send somebody who doesn't know you...

168
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,931
and won't care about
your side of the story.

169
00:20:30,033 --> 00:20:33,332
- I didn't kill her. I don't need a side.
- What's goin' on, Max?

170
00:20:33,436 --> 00:20:35,996
What are you mixed up in, man?
You can talk to me.

171
00:20:41,144 --> 00:20:43,840
You know what they think about you
at the force already, right?

172
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:46,415
You should hear all the questions
I get about my old partner.

173
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:50,646
- Well, good thing you got my back then?
- What's that supposed to mean?

174
00:20:50,754 --> 00:20:52,654
It means that with your follow-through
on unsolved murders...

175
00:20:52,756 --> 00:20:54,656
I don't have much hope
for that girl in the alley.

176
00:20:54,758 --> 00:20:56,749
Is that what you think?

177
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,852
That I didn't
work Michelle's case?

178
00:21:02,132 --> 00:21:04,123
I did everything.

179
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:06,464
<i>- Everything!</i>
- He's still out there somewhere.

180
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,163
One of them is still out there.
That's everything.

181
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:11,399
<i>All right?</i>

182
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:14,375
We're done here.

183
00:21:14,477 --> 00:21:16,877
<i>Come on! Max!</i>

184
00:21:18,548 --> 00:21:20,539
Very good.

185
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:23,141
<i>Pleasure doing business with you.</i>

186
00:22:15,872 --> 00:22:18,067
- Detective Max Payne-
- Is not available.

187
00:22:18,174 --> 00:22:20,074
- Shit!
- Please leave a message.

188
00:22:20,176 --> 00:22:22,076
Max, it's me, Alex.

189
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:30,311
Ms. Sax?

190
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,320
I'm sorry for your loss.

191
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:39,089
And we pulled
her cell phone log.

192
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:43,495
Last call was to an...
Owen Green.

193
00:22:45,568 --> 00:22:47,468
Called him twice.

194
00:23:09,826 --> 00:23:11,817
Max, it's me, Alex.

195
00:23:11,928 --> 00:23:13,896
<i>You're not gonna believe this,</i>
<i>but I think there's a connection...</i>

196
00:23:13,997 --> 00:23:16,056
<i>between that girl in the alley</i>
<i>and Michelle's murder.</i>

197
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:18,293
<i>I'm heading over</i>
<i>to your apartment right now.</i>

198
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:44,419
Alex, are you in here?

199
00:23:54,765 --> 00:23:56,665
Alex?

200
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,754
Alex?

201
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:29,390
Alex?

202
00:25:01,788 --> 00:25:05,315
<i>The E.R. doctor's old man</i>
<i>was a patrolman in the 45th.</i>

203
00:25:05,425 --> 00:25:07,325
<i>Got you on a quiet floor.</i>

204
00:25:07,427 --> 00:25:10,487
BB? Where am I?

205
00:25:10,597 --> 00:25:12,531
Saint Mary's.

206
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:15,965
Came in lookin' pretty bad, Max.
What happened?

207
00:25:16,069 --> 00:25:18,560
I don't...

208
00:25:18,671 --> 00:25:21,572
Alex.

209
00:25:21,674 --> 00:25:24,507
When dispatch
couldn't raise him...

210
00:25:24,611 --> 00:25:28,206
they found out from Christa
where he'd gone.

211
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:31,340
First unit got to you in time.

212
00:25:31,451 --> 00:25:33,351
But Alex was...

213
00:25:34,921 --> 00:25:36,855
Alex was dead.

214
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:42,458
I got six shots off.
I hit something-someone...

215
00:25:42,562 --> 00:25:44,553
You gotta check the hospitals.
You gotta check for...

216
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:48,623
I'm not a cop anymore, Max.
I came to see about you.

217
00:25:50,603 --> 00:25:52,503
He wanted to tell me something.

218
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:56,371
Listen. Anything
you can remember will help.

219
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,376
They got nothing for leads.

220
00:25:58,478 --> 00:26:01,379
The whole force has <i>you</i> pegged
as the prime suspect.

221
00:26:01,481 --> 00:26:03,381
Yeah, you tell them
where to find me.

222
00:26:04,551 --> 00:26:06,951
Wake starts in an hour.

223
00:26:07,053 --> 00:26:08,953
I'll pass that along.

224
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,321
<i>- What do you think you're doing?</i>
- Paying my respects.

225
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,228
Not like that, you aren't.

226
00:26:20,333 --> 00:26:24,326
I should have a clean shirt
for you at the office. It's on the way.

227
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,336
<i>Mr. Hensley? There you go.</i>

228
00:27:06,913 --> 00:27:10,781
- When did they move in here?
- I guess we got the building last year.

229
00:27:10,884 --> 00:27:12,909
- "We"?
- Sorry.

230
00:27:13,019 --> 00:27:15,146
Gets to be a habit.

231
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:32,401
- Mornin', Spike.
- Good morning, Mr. Hensley.

232
00:27:32,505 --> 00:27:35,941
You know the drill, sir.
Sign in your guest, please.

233
00:27:39,545 --> 00:27:42,275
Oh, my God.

234
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,976
Max.

235
00:27:45,084 --> 00:27:47,211
Ms. Horne.

236
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,948
How have you been?

237
00:27:50,056 --> 00:27:52,047
Fine, thanks.

238
00:27:52,158 --> 00:27:54,820
I hope you know
you can always call me.

239
00:27:54,928 --> 00:27:58,091
<i>Please, Max, if there is</i>
<i>ever anything we can do...</i>

240
00:27:58,197 --> 00:28:01,257
I know. I've been meaning to.
I got the cards. Thank you.

241
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:04,393
She was such a bright light
in this company.

242
00:28:08,074 --> 00:28:10,338
I'm not makin' any guarantees
that any of this'll fit.

243
00:28:15,281 --> 00:28:18,114
I saved one of those for you.
Third page from the back.

244
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:22,378
<i>They set up a scholarship</i>
<i>in her name.</i>

245
00:28:22,488 --> 00:28:25,821
<i>Kept comin' to me for suggestions</i>
<i>about what she might want.</i>

246
00:28:25,925 --> 00:28:29,088
<i>I said art.</i>

247
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:31,755
She liked art, right?

248
00:28:31,864 --> 00:28:35,766
<i>They knew we were close.</i>
<i>Thought I was family.</i>

249
00:28:35,868 --> 00:28:38,200
It's a nice thing,
a scholarship.

250
00:28:38,304 --> 00:28:40,602
<i>Good way to remember somebody.</i>

251
00:28:40,707 --> 00:28:43,175
Hey, Joe.

252
00:28:43,276 --> 00:28:46,109
Max, you remember Joe, right?

253
00:28:46,212 --> 00:28:48,942
Hey. You here pickin' up
some overtime?

254
00:28:49,048 --> 00:28:53,212
I'd think twice about that.
Hear the boss is a real asshole.

255
00:28:53,319 --> 00:28:57,187
Now that he's head of security,
we're supposed to laugh at his jokes.

256
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:59,190
They still pay me like the janitor.

257
00:28:59,292 --> 00:29:01,658
She's lookin' for you.

258
00:29:01,761 --> 00:29:03,786
Just tried me in my office too.

259
00:29:05,331 --> 00:29:07,231
Give me a second.

260
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:08,800
Yeah?

261
00:29:08,901 --> 00:29:11,426
<i>Nicole?</i>

262
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:14,472
<i>Relax.</i>
<i>I'm the head of security.</i>

263
00:29:36,396 --> 00:29:38,296
Christa.

264
00:29:42,668 --> 00:29:45,262
<i>Jesus.</i>

265
00:29:47,907 --> 00:29:51,172
All it would have taken
is one word from you...

266
00:29:52,278 --> 00:29:54,712
to give Alex some peace.

267
00:29:57,417 --> 00:29:59,476
Are you happy now, Max?

268
00:30:02,789 --> 00:30:04,950
You made him think
he hadn't done enough.

269
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,260
What have you done, Max?

270
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:12,891
What has Max Payne done?

271
00:30:15,168 --> 00:30:17,068
Except for bring misery...

272
00:30:18,438 --> 00:30:20,633
to everyone
who ever cared for him.

273
00:30:24,343 --> 00:30:27,540
Now please get out of my house.

274
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,547
Please, just go.

275
00:30:45,231 --> 00:30:48,394
Geez. Watch out for this prick.

276
00:30:49,502 --> 00:30:51,402
Detective Max Payne?

277
00:30:51,504 --> 00:30:53,938
Jim Bravura, Internal Affairs.
I need you to come with me.

278
00:30:55,341 --> 00:30:57,935
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

279
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,875
How'd the girl
have your wallet?

280
00:31:02,982 --> 00:31:05,007
She stole it.

281
00:31:05,118 --> 00:31:07,780
What do you mean, "stole"?
Like, picked your pocket?

282
00:31:11,257 --> 00:31:13,157
How was it you knew each other?

283
00:31:13,259 --> 00:31:15,420
We met through a friend.

284
00:31:17,763 --> 00:31:19,958
Trevor Duncan.

285
00:31:20,066 --> 00:31:22,432
- He's your friend?
- I guess.

286
00:31:22,535 --> 00:31:24,901
That's classy.

287
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:27,495
You know what Trevor does
for a livin', I assume.

288
00:31:28,608 --> 00:31:30,473
He used to snitch for me.

289
00:31:30,576 --> 00:31:32,567
Oh, used to.

290
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:37,180
Tell me somethin', Max.

291
00:31:37,283 --> 00:31:40,377
What's a glorified file clerk
still need a snitch for?

292
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:46,149
So you'd piss
in a cup for us, right?

293
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:50,195
You just said the magic words. Why don't
you call when you hear from a union lawyer?

294
00:31:50,296 --> 00:31:54,164
You and Detective Balder haven't
worked together since your reassignment.

295
00:31:55,668 --> 00:31:58,262
<i>What made you</i>
<i>get back in touch?</i>

296
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:01,204
- He wanted to talk.
<i>- And?</i>

297
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:05,974
Hey, asshole!
I got two bodies in 10 body bags.

298
00:32:06,078 --> 00:32:07,978
<i>You were the last person</i>
<i>to see either one.</i>

299
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,345
<i>Yeah, and some of that blood is mine.</i>
<i>Good luck with your case.</i>

300
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:14,351
Nice work, Detective.

301
00:32:15,688 --> 00:32:20,682
Look, if you're really his friend,
then talk to him.

302
00:32:29,035 --> 00:32:31,697
Well, let's hope that felt good.

303
00:32:31,804 --> 00:32:34,432
Makes you look guilty.
You understand that, right?

304
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:37,873
It's not just Alex's unit
that thinks you're the guy.

305
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:40,969
You need friends
on the force right now.

306
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:43,105
There's only so much I can do
from the outside.

307
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:48,346
Where you goin'?

308
00:32:51,224 --> 00:32:53,124
Stupid son of a bitch.

309
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,185
<i>Hey. I don't believe it.</i>

310
00:32:57,296 --> 00:33:01,062
- Just the guy.
<i>- You gotta be kiddin' me.</i>

311
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:04,534
<i>- Let's get the son of a bitch.</i>
- Where you think you're goin'?

312
00:33:04,637 --> 00:33:08,164
<i>- Unbelievable.</i>
<i>- The detective in that office was killed.</i>

313
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:11,903
<i>Get back here, asshole!</i>
<i>Where do you think you're goin'?</i>

314
00:33:12,011 --> 00:33:13,876
<i>There's no point runnin', Max!</i>
<i>What are you gonna do in there?</i>

315
00:33:22,981 --> 00:33:25,142
Back up. Back up. Make a hole!

316
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:27,683
Back up, goddamn it!
Make a hole!

317
00:33:28,886 --> 00:33:31,616
<i>- He's a cop killer.</i>
- Open up, Max!

318
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:34,692
<i>Open up the goddamn door, Max!</i>

319
00:33:37,328 --> 00:33:40,593
Open up! Don't make it hard!
Open up!

320
00:33:44,068 --> 00:33:46,969
Goddamn it! Open up this fuckin' door!

321
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:49,665
<i>- Open it!</i>
<i>- Let's bust his face!</i>

322
00:33:49,774 --> 00:33:53,574
<i>- Open the goddamn door!</i>
<i>- You're only gonna make it worse!</i>

323
00:33:55,246 --> 00:33:58,010
<i>Come on, Max!</i>
<i>Get your ass out here!</i>

324
00:33:58,116 --> 00:33:59,515
<i>- Bust it down!</i>
- Open up!

325
00:34:06,858 --> 00:34:09,190
<i>Now, Max! Now! Open the door!</i>

326
00:34:12,563 --> 00:34:14,292
Get ya, Max!

327
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,299
Son of a bitch!

328
00:34:25,743 --> 00:34:28,109
Hey, Mike. Where is he?

329
00:34:32,274 --> 00:34:36,267
Oh, for God's sake, Max. You're gonna freeze to death.
Why don't you come inside?

330
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:39,438
Alex knew something about Michelle.
Something new.

331
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:41,448
Don't you think he would've
told you if he had something?

332
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,541
He was trying to
the night he was killed.

333
00:34:43,652 --> 00:34:46,815
- Whatever was in the room-
- What do you think you're looking for?

334
00:34:46,922 --> 00:34:49,117
- Forget it. All right?
- Max, talk to me!

335
00:34:49,224 --> 00:34:51,215
Max?

336
00:34:51,327 --> 00:34:53,625
Now where you goin'?

337
00:35:03,876 --> 00:35:06,367
<i>Max Payne.</i>

338
00:35:39,912 --> 00:35:43,871
Drop your weapon.

339
00:35:43,983 --> 00:35:46,008
Just take it easy.

340
00:35:47,953 --> 00:35:51,616
Remove your backup piece
with your left hand.

341
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:02,226
- That's it.
- Kneel down.

342
00:36:02,334 --> 00:36:04,325
- What?
- Kneel the fuck down!

343
00:36:06,238 --> 00:36:08,138
Shit.

344
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,614
We need to talk about my sister.

345
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,749
Look, my partner was killed too.
We're both looking for the same person.

346
00:36:24,857 --> 00:36:27,087
Yeah, you.

347
00:36:31,854 --> 00:36:34,448
Who's Owen Green?

348
00:36:36,192 --> 00:36:38,990
- How did you get that name?
- Look, Natasha called...

349
00:36:39,095 --> 00:36:42,292
- Don't say her name!
- I heard her call him. Okay?

350
00:36:42,398 --> 00:36:45,128
Owen's probably the last person
who saw her alive.

351
00:36:45,234 --> 00:36:49,796
Yeah? Except for the guy that
left his wallet laying by her body.

352
00:36:49,905 --> 00:36:52,430
Does that sound like something
a homicide cop gets wrong?

353
00:36:52,541 --> 00:36:56,910
Whoever killed your sister probably did the
same thing to my partner and maybe my...

354
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:02,283
Look, you wanna help?
Help me find Owen Green.

355
00:37:19,769 --> 00:37:21,669
<i>Right here.</i>

356
00:37:21,771 --> 00:37:23,830
Green is on the top floor.

357
00:37:26,842 --> 00:37:30,073
You know what I do for a living.
You try anything, and I'll kill you.

358
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,660
Who is this guy?

359
00:38:11,762 --> 00:38:14,196
Some junkie
my sister used to know.

360
00:38:46,763 --> 00:38:50,392
Owen! Owen, open up!

361
00:38:51,768 --> 00:38:53,929
Owen?

362
00:38:58,141 --> 00:39:00,166
Owen?

363
00:39:04,614 --> 00:39:06,514
Hey!

364
00:39:08,185 --> 00:39:10,176
They're comin'.

365
00:39:11,288 --> 00:39:13,188
<i>Owen!</i>

366
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,190
<i>Hey, Owen.</i>

367
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:20,129
They're coming.

368
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:22,858
Owen, look at me.

369
00:39:22,966 --> 00:39:25,594
<i>Owen, look at me.</i>

370
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:29,570
I know Natasha called you.
Do you know what happened to her?

371
00:39:31,208 --> 00:39:33,369
She's gone.

372
00:39:36,279 --> 00:39:38,975
They took her.

373
00:39:39,082 --> 00:39:41,016
<i>Owen?</i>

374
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:45,647
Owen, just relax.

375
00:39:45,755 --> 00:39:48,155
They took her up in their wings.

376
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,251
They took her.

377
00:39:54,064 --> 00:39:56,828
<i>Owen...</i>

378
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:02,401
<i>Owen.</i>

379
00:40:31,124 --> 00:40:33,183
Jesus.

380
00:40:53,213 --> 00:40:57,616
<i>You know, it isn't anything new. People jump
out of windows. They go crazy for no reason.</i>

381
00:40:57,717 --> 00:40:59,878
It just happens.

382
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:06,290
My Natasha
got all her work done here.

383
00:41:17,103 --> 00:41:19,503
I have to call you back, okay?

384
00:41:21,908 --> 00:41:23,967
Can I help you with somethin'?

385
00:41:24,077 --> 00:41:26,045
Yeah.

386
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,173
If I wanted to get this tattoo...

387
00:41:29,282 --> 00:41:31,273
- You in the marine corps?
- This one.

388
00:41:31,384 --> 00:41:33,909
<i>What's it mean?</i>

389
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,454
That's a Norse Valkyrie.

390
00:41:36,556 --> 00:41:39,252
Vikings used to wear them
for protection.

391
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,228
Valkyries fly over the battlefield
picking out the righteous dead.

392
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:48,357
They reward the people
who draw first blood.

393
00:41:48,468 --> 00:41:50,368
A soldier's angel.

394
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:56,032
In Norse mythology...

395
00:41:56,142 --> 00:41:58,804
the only way
you get to go to heaven...

396
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:01,903
is to die in violence.

397
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:05,007
You die in your sleep,
you go to hell.

398
00:42:07,354 --> 00:42:10,653
Protection from what?

399
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:13,784
What do you mean, "huh"? You said
people get the tattoo as protection.

400
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:16,658
What are they afraid of?

401
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:24,030
<i>Please!</i>

402
00:42:29,243 --> 00:42:31,643
Please...

403
00:43:08,816 --> 00:43:12,616
- Come on!
- ¡Callate!

404
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:16,281
<i>¡Callate!</i>

405
00:43:37,545 --> 00:43:39,706
Oh, God!

406
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,760
This is far enough.

407
00:44:42,509 --> 00:44:45,034
I need to speak with Lincoln.

408
00:45:07,001 --> 00:45:11,802
- You expecting company there, Lincoln?
- It's very dangerous right now.

409
00:45:11,906 --> 00:45:13,806
I hear about your sister.

410
00:45:15,175 --> 00:45:18,474
Yeah?
You know anything about it?

411
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:22,048
She will not be the last.

412
00:45:25,586 --> 00:45:27,577
What about the tattoos?

413
00:45:27,688 --> 00:45:29,986
What do they mean?

414
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:31,990
The wings.

415
00:45:33,427 --> 00:45:35,327
He marks them.

416
00:45:36,830 --> 00:45:38,730
Yeah? What does that mean?

417
00:45:38,832 --> 00:45:41,699
The devil is building his army.

418
00:45:42,803 --> 00:45:44,361
Yeah.

419
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,300
Does this devil have a name?

420
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:51,742
Many.

421
00:45:51,845 --> 00:45:54,541
The one you are looking for
is Lupino.

422
00:45:57,518 --> 00:46:00,487
A place called Rag Na Rock.

423
00:46:00,587 --> 00:46:03,147
<i>It's an old club. East Side.</i>

424
00:46:06,994 --> 00:46:11,021
Listen. You still got
an in with the cops, right?

425
00:46:13,334 --> 00:46:15,302
See if they know anything
about a Detective Max Payne.

426
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:17,927
Max Payne?

427
00:46:19,974 --> 00:46:21,942
What?

428
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:24,840
<i>Max Payne-he's been hunting.</i>

429
00:46:26,113 --> 00:46:29,344
Three years
of kicking down doors.

430
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:34,314
He is looking for something...

431
00:46:34,421 --> 00:46:37,549
that God wants to stay hidden.

432
00:46:37,658 --> 00:46:41,651
And that's what makes him
even more dangerous.

433
00:46:46,166 --> 00:46:50,500
Mona, stay away from Max Payne.

434
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,336
You don't want to be near him
when Judgment Day comes.

435
00:47:08,155 --> 00:47:10,851
<i>They took her up in their wings.</i>

436
00:47:10,958 --> 00:47:13,654
<i>Their wings are golden.</i>
<i>The feathers only look black.</i>

437
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:17,664
<i>That's a Norse Valkyrie.</i>

438
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:20,598
<i>A soldier's angel.</i>

439
00:47:20,701 --> 00:47:22,896
<i>She was</i>
<i>such a bright light in this company.</i>

440
00:49:35,202 --> 00:49:37,864
- What is it? What's going on?
- Coffee?

441
00:49:37,971 --> 00:49:39,962
It isn't that
I've been missing something.

442
00:49:41,408 --> 00:49:43,308
It's that something <i>is</i> missing.

443
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,039
- So?
<i>- BB, what do you mean, "so"?</i>

444
00:49:47,147 --> 00:49:49,445
What would somebody want
with her work papers?

445
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:51,108
I don't know.

446
00:49:51,218 --> 00:49:53,686
Who would then? Her old supervisor-
What is his name?

447
00:49:53,787 --> 00:49:55,237
Max, this has gone far enough!

448
00:49:55,238 --> 00:49:56,688
<i>That snotty-nosed, little preppy prick-
What is his name?</i>

449
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,452
Colvin. John Colvin.
Is he still around?

450
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,824
Hold on, Max.

451
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:03,954
BB, is he still working
for the company?

452
00:50:07,668 --> 00:50:09,568
Jason Colvin.

453
00:50:10,604 --> 00:50:12,504
Guy's name is Jason.

454
00:50:12,606 --> 00:50:14,767
Thank you.

455
00:50:27,921 --> 00:50:29,821
<i>This is Detective Bravura.</i>

456
00:50:29,923 --> 00:50:33,324
<i>Detective, I need to speak</i>
<i>with you about Max right away.</i>

457
00:50:33,427 --> 00:50:35,554
<i>Please. It's urgent.</i>

458
00:50:37,698 --> 00:50:40,496
<i>Detective, thanks for
seeing me at my office.</i>

459
00:50:40,601 --> 00:50:42,899
<i>I need to explain</i>
<i>what happened to Max.</i>

460
00:50:43,003 --> 00:50:45,767
A file
can't tell you everything.

461
00:50:45,872 --> 00:50:49,308
Maybe you think that's all
you need to know about Max.

462
00:50:54,014 --> 00:50:56,983
<i>Can't tell you</i>
<i>how beautiful Michelle was...</i>

463
00:50:58,619 --> 00:51:00,678
how happy they were together...

464
00:51:06,226 --> 00:51:09,161
<i>Can't tell you how the baby</i>
<i>looked just like him.</i>

465
00:51:20,674 --> 00:51:22,574
<i>It started out as a robbery.</i>

466
00:51:25,746 --> 00:51:30,706
<i>The perps were losers, garbage.</i>
<i>Had records, but nothing big.</i>

467
00:51:33,287 --> 00:51:36,051
<i>That day, though, who knows?</i>

468
00:51:38,158 --> 00:51:41,059
<i>Guess they were out</i>
<i>for something... more.</i>

469
00:52:23,437 --> 00:52:26,099
Michelle!

470
00:52:26,206 --> 00:52:29,664
Michelle! Michelle!

471
00:52:29,776 --> 00:52:33,234
Michelle!

472
00:52:38,352 --> 00:52:41,617
It's okay. The angels burn
within them now.

473
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:43,445
<i>He was maybe 10 minutes too late.</i>

474
00:53:49,189 --> 00:53:52,625
<i>That's all. Ten minutes.</i>

475
00:54:05,806 --> 00:54:08,366
We looked everywhere for the third guy.
But there was nothin' to go on.

476
00:54:10,202 --> 00:54:11,362
<i>Max...</i>

477
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:15,964
<i>transferred to Cold Case,</i>
<i>working leads that went nowhere.</i>

478
00:54:16,075 --> 00:54:20,978
<i>He was... never the same.</i>

479
00:54:22,414 --> 00:54:25,281
Of course not.

480
00:54:25,384 --> 00:54:30,378
Understand.
This is my old partner's kid.

481
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:35,452
He's family.
You gotta help him here.

482
00:54:36,762 --> 00:54:39,196
You should hear the kind of things
Max is saying.

483
00:54:39,298 --> 00:54:41,562
<i>None of it makes any sense.</i>

484
00:54:41,667 --> 00:54:45,660
He's gotten in his head that someone here
at the company is responsible.

485
00:54:45,771 --> 00:54:51,539
I'm worried he's gonna... get into another
situation before I can convince him to come in.

486
00:54:53,445 --> 00:54:56,005
- So you really think he's-
- I think you need to find him.

487
00:55:29,481 --> 00:55:31,415
What is it, Jason?

488
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:34,451
I...

489
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:52,363
Is this a threat?

490
00:55:53,572 --> 00:55:56,803
No! No, I...

491
00:55:57,843 --> 00:55:59,811
I just thought
you should be aware.

492
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,181
Just take care of it, Jason.

493
00:56:28,507 --> 00:56:30,702
You'll have the opportunity
to come in and talk to...

494
00:56:35,814 --> 00:56:37,714
There's someone in your office.

495
00:56:42,354 --> 00:56:44,379
It's a detective.

496
00:56:59,922 --> 00:57:01,947
This your daughter?

497
00:57:03,693 --> 00:57:06,924
Yes, it is. Three years old.

498
00:57:07,029 --> 00:57:08,963
She's beautiful.

499
00:57:09,065 --> 00:57:11,397
Is there something I can
help you with, Detective?

500
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:13,696
I don't know yet.

501
00:57:16,172 --> 00:57:19,073
Maybe if you told me
what this was about.

502
00:57:20,409 --> 00:57:23,674
It's a homicide-
multiple homicides.

503
00:57:26,149 --> 00:57:28,049
I didn't get your name.

504
00:57:30,086 --> 00:57:32,611
Max Payne.

505
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,757
Sorry. I didn't recognize you.

506
00:57:36,859 --> 00:57:39,589
That's okay.

507
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:42,061
What can you tell me about
what Michelle was working on...

508
00:57:44,167 --> 00:57:46,067
right before she died?

509
00:57:53,743 --> 00:57:55,836
I don't know, routine projects.

510
00:57:58,014 --> 00:57:59,914
Nothin' really
out of the ordinary.

511
00:58:06,589 --> 00:58:09,786
Look, it's really hard
to be specific that... long ago.

512
00:58:09,892 --> 00:58:12,861
Well, can't you look it up?

513
00:58:14,764 --> 00:58:17,062
I don't know how I would,
really.

514
00:58:19,969 --> 00:58:23,598
You know th-that far back
any documents we had...

515
00:58:23,706 --> 00:58:27,301
would be gone, and...

516
00:58:30,279 --> 00:58:32,247
I'm not-
I'm not sure of any other way.

517
00:58:32,348 --> 00:58:34,316
So there's just no trace of her?

518
00:58:34,417 --> 00:58:37,181
Well, it's nothing personal.
We just...

519
00:58:38,621 --> 00:58:41,590
Can't keep-
Save everything and...

520
00:58:41,691 --> 00:58:45,092
- You need to make a call?
- Maybe I should.

521
00:58:45,194 --> 00:58:49,654
Yeah. Beautiful office
you have here.

522
00:58:49,765 --> 00:58:54,134
Jackie, hi. Detective...

523
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,668
- What do you know?
- Wait.

524
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:01,655
I need to talk to somebody about
a woman that used to work here.

525
00:59:01,656 --> 00:59:03,436
You can have a seat over there.

526
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:10,505
Mr. Colvin?

527
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:12,702
- You're lying to me! Why?
- I'm not!

528
00:59:12,811 --> 00:59:15,780
<i>Mr. Colvin?</i>

529
00:59:15,881 --> 00:59:18,509
- Tell me what happened to Michelle.
- I don't know.

530
00:59:18,617 --> 00:59:20,312
Mr. Colvin, are you okay?

531
00:59:20,419 --> 00:59:24,014
- Jackie!
<i>- Mr. Colvin, it's Jackie! I can hear you!</i>

532
00:59:24,122 --> 00:59:26,181
<i>Are you all right?</i>

533
00:59:29,461 --> 00:59:33,022
- What was she working on?
- I don't know!

534
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:35,998
I was in charge of a different project.
It was a government contract.

535
00:59:36,101 --> 00:59:37,728
What did it have to do
with Michelle?

536
00:59:37,836 --> 00:59:40,202
Nothing! She was just...

537
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,740
Security.

538
00:59:43,842 --> 00:59:45,742
Can I speak to BB, please?

539
00:59:47,879 --> 00:59:49,972
- Yeah?
- BB, help! It's Jackie. Jason's in trouble.

540
00:59:50,082 --> 00:59:51,982
- What?
- Should I call your guys?

541
00:59:52,084 --> 00:59:55,281
- No, no, no. I'll call.
- Hurry, please.

542
00:59:58,290 --> 01:00:00,758
Oh, shit. Okay.

543
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:03,419
It was a military operation.

544
01:00:03,528 --> 01:00:08,192
<i>It was something to make...</i>
<i>soldiers more aggressive in combat.</i>

545
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:14,170
It was a disaster. It only worked
on one percent. Made them invincible.

546
01:00:14,273 --> 01:00:18,869
All right? The rest suffered horrible
hallucinations-devils, demons.

547
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:23,241
<i>It drove them insane.</i>

548
01:00:23,348 --> 01:00:27,478
I mean,
the effects were uncontrollable.

549
01:00:27,586 --> 01:00:32,182
And the stuff was so addictive, we couldn't even
guarantee the safety of our own scientists.

550
01:00:32,291 --> 01:00:37,456
<i>And we had to shut it down.</i>
<i>The test subjects, they'd follow 'em home.</i>

551
01:00:37,562 --> 01:00:39,928
They'd kill 'em,
just for an extra dose.

552
01:00:41,066 --> 01:00:44,832
- Is that what happened to Michelle?
- No.

553
01:00:47,439 --> 01:00:49,339
<i>Let's go! Move! Move!</i>

554
01:00:56,815 --> 01:00:59,306
- What do you mean, no? What happened to her then?
- Please! Jesus!

555
01:00:59,418 --> 01:01:03,650
Please! Look. She didn't even know
what was coming for her.

556
01:01:03,755 --> 01:01:07,213
<i>Mr. Colvin, I called security,</i>
<i>and they're on their way!</i>

557
01:01:07,326 --> 01:01:11,820
I will tell you what happened. You gotta
get me outta here though. Right now.

558
01:01:11,930 --> 01:01:13,397
What are you talking about?

559
01:01:13,398 --> 01:01:14,865
I will confess to everything,
but you gotta get me outta here!

560
01:01:14,966 --> 01:01:17,833
That's not good enough! You tell me
what happened to her right now!

561
01:01:17,936 --> 01:01:22,168
She was killed because of the drugs!
The envelope.

562
01:01:22,274 --> 01:01:25,266
<i>Bring it with us.</i>
<i>Everything. It's all in there.</i>

563
01:01:25,377 --> 01:01:29,040
Please. You've gotta
protect me from them.

564
01:01:29,147 --> 01:01:30,978
Who are you talking about?

565
01:01:31,083 --> 01:01:33,517
The man who killed your wife!

566
01:01:33,618 --> 01:01:36,519
Get the envelope. Get it!

567
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:40,149
Let's go.

568
01:01:43,595 --> 01:01:45,563
Calm down!

569
01:01:45,664 --> 01:01:48,064
Relax! N.Y.P. D!

570
01:02:21,466 --> 01:02:23,195
<i>Shots fired!</i>

571
01:02:29,341 --> 01:02:31,673
- Central Dispatch.
- This is Jim Bravura. I.A.

572
01:02:31,777 --> 01:02:33,836
What unit is responding
to the Aesir call?

573
01:02:39,284 --> 01:02:41,115
The Aesir building! You mean
nobody's called anything in yet?

574
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:44,086
- Would you like to report an incident?
- Hell, yes, I'd like to report somethin'!

575
01:02:44,189 --> 01:02:45,679
We have machine gun fire
in Midtown!

576
01:02:53,298 --> 01:02:54,322
Fire!

577
01:02:58,437 --> 01:02:59,904
<i>God damn it!</i>

578
01:03:04,810 --> 01:03:07,074
<i>Get down!</i>

579
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:16,954
Move! Move! Move! Move!

580
01:03:22,627 --> 01:03:24,891
<i>Hold fire! Hold fire!</i>

581
01:03:44,816 --> 01:03:48,013
- Knock down that door!
- Put your hands up!

582
01:03:48,119 --> 01:03:50,451
- You need to come in now!
- Not a chance!

583
01:03:50,555 --> 01:03:52,546
- Come on!
- Is this about your wife?

584
01:03:52,657 --> 01:03:55,217
- Colvin knew.
- Take it easy, Max.

585
01:03:55,327 --> 01:03:57,591
Just come in and we'll talk about this
right now. All right?

586
01:03:57,696 --> 01:04:00,756
Clear!

587
01:04:03,034 --> 01:04:04,934
Move!

588
01:04:05,036 --> 01:04:07,004
- Where is he?
- I can't see!

589
01:04:07,105 --> 01:04:09,005
Got anything?

590
01:04:09,107 --> 01:04:11,302
No, he's gone!

591
01:04:11,409 --> 01:04:14,139
Great job, boys! See what you did?
You let 'im get away.

592
01:04:14,246 --> 01:04:16,441
<i>- Let me see your hands!</i>
- Relax, motherfucker! N.Y.P.D.

593
01:04:16,548 --> 01:04:19,142
<i>- What the fuck is goin' on up there?</i>
- Yeah. Good job!

594
01:04:19,251 --> 01:04:22,084
Everybody gonna get a medal for this.
Great! Damn!

595
01:04:29,794 --> 01:04:31,421
I'm at the office.
I'll call you back.

596
01:05:00,115 --> 01:05:05,212
<i>And will forever give them</i>
<i>the combat edge in conflicts of the future.</i>

597
01:05:05,321 --> 01:05:10,918
<i>Valkyr-100% effective.</i>
<i>100% combat tested.</i>

598
01:05:11,026 --> 01:05:14,257
<i>The new weapon</i>
<i>in the war on terror.</i>

599
01:05:14,363 --> 01:05:17,423
<i>Valkyr, the strength of freedom.</i>

600
01:05:17,533 --> 01:05:22,129
<i>- Valkyr, winning the war on terror.</i>
- You need to see this.

601
01:05:24,807 --> 01:05:27,207
<i>From the dawn of time...</i>

602
01:05:27,309 --> 01:05:31,177
great generals have always known
the one fundamental truth of warfare.

603
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:34,078
<i>Morale wins battles.</i>

604
01:05:34,183 --> 01:05:37,914
Thanks to the breakthroughs made
by Aesir Pharmaceuticals...

605
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:43,959
the military of tomorrow will be able to unlock
the limitless potential inside every soldier.

606
01:05:44,059 --> 01:05:49,861
<i>Introducing Valkyr.</i>
<i>The strength of freedom.</i>

607
01:05:51,033 --> 01:05:54,127
<i>That's what this is about? A drug?</i>

608
01:06:01,944 --> 01:06:07,382
How has your experience of combat
improved since taking the drug Valkyr?

609
01:06:07,483 --> 01:06:10,816
Well, I'm never scared, for starters.

610
01:06:10,919 --> 01:06:15,356
<i>Describe to me, if you will,</i>
<i>how is Valkyr winning the war on terror?</i>

611
01:06:15,457 --> 01:06:18,187
You face down
a group of insurgents...

612
01:06:18,293 --> 01:06:23,356
and instead of fear,
you're filled with peace, I guess.

613
01:06:23,465 --> 01:06:26,901
<i>It's like something's</i>
<i>watching over you from above.</i>

614
01:06:27,002 --> 01:06:28,697
You feel like you have wings.

615
01:06:28,804 --> 01:06:32,672
<i>So wouldn't you say you feel stronger,</i>
<i>more secure, more capable?</i>

616
01:06:32,775 --> 01:06:37,269
Oh, definitely. It's just whatever it takes
to win the war out there.

617
01:06:37,379 --> 01:06:40,542
I feel indestructible.
Nothing can stop me.

618
01:06:40,649 --> 01:06:42,879
I can face anything.

619
01:06:42,985 --> 01:06:46,045
<i>Have you noticed any side effects?</i>

620
01:06:48,757 --> 01:06:51,453
I can only speak for myself,
and... no.

621
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:56,224
- I apologize. You wanna do it again?
- No, we're good.

622
01:06:56,331 --> 01:07:00,062
<i>That's enough. Turn it off.</i>

623
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:05,471
Killed my wife.

624
01:07:05,574 --> 01:07:07,735
<i>Natasha too.</i>

625
01:07:09,678 --> 01:07:12,078
He's in an old club
called Rag Na Rock.

626
01:07:15,751 --> 01:07:20,051
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

627
01:07:27,396 --> 01:07:30,763
<i>Forget it, Max.</i>
<i>You go there, you die.</i>

628
01:07:34,269 --> 01:07:36,829
You have my help with anything else,
but not to go in there.

629
01:07:36,939 --> 01:07:38,839
Yeah, you keep it then.

630
01:07:42,945 --> 01:07:45,140
You don't wanna
make it out alive.

631
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:51,281
You think that if he puts you out
of your misery, you'll be with them again.

632
01:07:52,855 --> 01:07:55,585
Yeah, I hope
that's how it works.

633
01:09:26,281 --> 01:09:28,579
<i>Copy that. You need help up front?</i>

634
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:35,620
<i>Unit Six, Lupino is secure.</i>

635
01:14:05,131 --> 01:14:08,191
You hear them coming.

636
01:14:11,404 --> 01:14:14,965
We'll see which one of us
they're flying for.

637
01:14:15,075 --> 01:14:17,805
We'll see which one of us
they love best.

638
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,548
God, you're so blessed.

639
01:14:24,284 --> 01:14:29,551
The angels-The angels are not
done with you yet!

640
01:14:53,138 --> 01:14:55,038
BB?

641
01:15:00,679 --> 01:15:02,704
What's goin' on here, BB?

642
01:15:03,816 --> 01:15:06,808
Let's go.

643
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:10,047
Let's get outta here.

644
01:15:17,229 --> 01:15:19,754
BB-BB, what's goin' on here?

645
01:15:19,865 --> 01:15:23,733
BB, I looked at Lupino, he didn't know
who I was. What are you doin' here?

646
01:15:28,374 --> 01:15:30,842
- Now?
- No, not yet!

647
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,911
Cuff him.

648
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:42,721
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>
<i>Michelle kept nosin' around.</i>

649
01:15:42,821 --> 01:15:46,086
<i>Some boxes from a dead project</i>
<i>went missing.</i>

650
01:15:46,191 --> 01:15:48,853
She mentioned it to me without knowing
what it really meant.

651
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:52,590
I had to-I had to talk to her.

652
01:15:52,698 --> 01:15:56,429
Show her my side
before she took it to someone else.

653
01:15:56,535 --> 01:15:58,696
<i>Before that night...</i>

654
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:02,296
<i>the things that went wrong for me</i>
<i>seemed impossible to do anything about.</i>

655
01:16:04,043 --> 01:16:08,776
Michelle was the first problem in my life
small enough to reach out and stop.

656
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:15,040
Once that happened, though, once I realized
I could use the strength of my hands...

657
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:18,142
to keep one thing
from being taken away from me...

658
01:16:19,554 --> 01:16:24,457
Well, by the time Michelle
stopped screaming that night...

659
01:16:24,559 --> 01:16:26,754
I'd learned
the most amazing lesson.

660
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:32,122
I could've been doing this
my entire life.

661
01:16:34,569 --> 01:16:38,266
I was a new person that night.

662
01:16:40,008 --> 01:16:43,535
All the other things
that I'd ever let go.

663
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:48,810
The-The times I'd accepted
my own... weakness...

664
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:51,408
I could've just reached out
my hands and stopped it.

665
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:56,150
<i>And from there, figuring out</i>
<i>how to put the drug on the street...</i>

666
01:16:56,258 --> 01:17:00,957
how to make use of Lupino and
the rest of them, well, that was easy.

667
01:17:01,063 --> 01:17:03,429
But only because of Michelle...

668
01:17:03,532 --> 01:17:06,899
the first problem
I really solved for myself.

669
01:17:09,404 --> 01:17:13,500
The second... was the baby.

670
01:17:33,395 --> 01:17:36,296
Okay, enough.
Enough of this shit.

671
01:17:36,398 --> 01:17:38,298
BB!

672
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:41,892
Joe, why don't you
calm the fuck down?

673
01:17:53,081 --> 01:17:56,573
It's not like we didn't see it comin'.

674
01:17:56,685 --> 01:17:58,983
Sullen, withdrawn.

675
01:17:59,087 --> 01:18:01,988
<i>Max just never seemed</i>
<i>the same after the tragedy.</i>

676
01:18:03,992 --> 01:18:05,687
Grab me some of that rope.

677
01:18:05,927 --> 01:18:09,920
It's a good thing his father
didn't live to see it though.

678
01:18:10,031 --> 01:18:14,968
The great Bill Payne's only son.

679
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:21,404
A strung-out junkie suicide.

680
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:24,636
It would have eaten him alive...

681
01:18:30,519 --> 01:18:31,816
<i>Get him, Joe!</i>

682
01:18:56,602 --> 01:19:00,231
Screw him.
He'll freeze to death.

683
01:19:02,942 --> 01:19:04,842
Come on.

684
01:20:36,569 --> 01:20:38,537
Not yet, Max.

685
01:23:11,490 --> 01:23:14,425
<i>Bravura! What the hell is goin' on?</i>

686
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:19,055
Why is half my force here instead of out on the street?
Under what authority do you...

687
01:23:19,165 --> 01:23:22,692
I am investigating the shooting
of an unarmed civilian, Jason Colvin.

688
01:23:22,802 --> 01:23:25,600
And the attempted murder
of Detective Max Payne.

689
01:23:25,704 --> 01:23:27,604
Really? Well, I heard
he took the first shot.

690
01:23:27,706 --> 01:23:31,437
If I know the men I serve with, I don't
think that they're gonna contradict that.

691
01:23:31,544 --> 01:23:33,910
- Yeah, and what kinda men would that be?
- These are real cops.

692
01:23:34,013 --> 01:23:35,708
- Oh.
- No offense.

693
01:23:35,815 --> 01:23:40,980
None taken. Agent Taliente,
I'd like you to meet a real cop.

694
01:23:41,086 --> 01:23:45,386
Detective. Jack Taliente,
Special Agent, F.B.I. Who are you?

695
01:23:51,564 --> 01:23:54,727
Bravura called in the F.B.I.

696
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:56,768
They're on their way.

697
01:24:00,072 --> 01:24:04,202
For God sakes, come on!
Max is dead! They got nothin' else!

698
01:24:04,310 --> 01:24:06,574
<i>Come on!</i>

699
01:24:07,947 --> 01:24:10,677
- Get 'em in! Get 'em in!
- Car's waiting! Let's go!

700
01:24:13,219 --> 01:24:14,618
<i>Hit the button! P1!</i>

701
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,621
Calm down, Joe.

702
01:24:17,723 --> 01:24:20,954
This is Air One
proceeding northbound 3-5-0-500.

703
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:24,120
E.T.A. three mikes.
Give me a frequency to push to.

704
01:24:24,230 --> 01:24:27,791
<i>P.D. Air One,</i>
<i>please return my frequency. 126-105.</i>

705
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:30,095
Copy that, Dispatch.
We're inbound.

706
01:24:32,238 --> 01:24:34,263
Your car's waiting, sir.

707
01:24:49,755 --> 01:24:51,723
Oh, shit.

708
01:24:53,954 --> 01:24:56,548
- He's not dead. He's here.
- Bullshit.

709
01:24:59,860 --> 01:25:02,124
- Let's move it! Move! Move!
- Go!

710
01:25:04,298 --> 01:25:06,391
Get him, Joe!

711
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,434
Where the hell is he?

712
01:25:12,206 --> 01:25:14,106
Where the hell you going, Joe?

713
01:25:17,678 --> 01:25:20,579
<i>- P.D. Air One, say your last.</i>
- We need more information.

714
01:25:20,681 --> 01:25:24,412
Do you got Bravura on the line for us? We need-
We need more information on this situation.

715
01:25:24,518 --> 01:25:26,281
Who you callin'?

716
01:25:29,857 --> 01:25:32,553
It's late.

717
01:25:32,660 --> 01:25:37,222
- I need you to send a helicopter to the roof.
- What are you talking about, BB?

718
01:25:37,331 --> 01:25:40,425
The Michelle Payne thing's
coming back on us!

719
01:25:52,713 --> 01:25:54,704
<i>Air One,</i>
<i>this is Lieutenant Jim Bravura.</i>

720
01:25:54,815 --> 01:25:57,477
<i>Federal agents and uniforms</i>
<i>are inbound at this time.</i>

721
01:26:10,597 --> 01:26:13,327
Take some C-4.

722
01:26:13,434 --> 01:26:17,530
- Wire it so he can't make it to the roof.
- Are you nuts?

723
01:26:17,638 --> 01:26:20,163
You saw him.

724
01:26:20,274 --> 01:26:23,266
<i>You saw him, Joe.</i>
<i>He isn't gonna stop.</i>

725
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:32,815
No!

726
01:26:51,138 --> 01:26:52,605
Okay, we got multiple shots
fired. We need back-up ASAP.

727
01:26:52,706 --> 01:26:53,673
<i>Copy that, P.D. Air One.</i>

728
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:17,080
<i>- Michelle?</i>
- Max.

729
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:21,786
Max?

730
01:28:32,955 --> 01:28:37,449
Max! Max, come on.

731
01:28:37,559 --> 01:28:41,757
Listen, I will hold them off for as long
as I can, but you have to finish this.

732
01:28:41,864 --> 01:28:45,891
Max, come on.

733
01:28:46,001 --> 01:28:49,095
Come on. Come on. Take it.

734
01:28:49,204 --> 01:28:50,796
Take it!

735
01:28:53,676 --> 01:28:55,576
Max, come on. Look at me.

736
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:00,207
You're not done yet.

737
01:29:10,659 --> 01:29:14,925
Come on. Come on, pick up!
Where are you? Come on!

738
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:52,398
<i>Be careful with that thing.</i>

739
01:29:52,501 --> 01:29:55,368
Come on now, Mona.

740
01:29:56,538 --> 01:29:58,972
I'm sure we can
work something out.

741
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:09,543
BB!

742
01:30:35,778 --> 01:30:41,148
<i>Detective Max Payne is in the line</i>
<i>of fire. Snipers, do not take the shot.</i>

743
01:30:44,186 --> 01:30:47,747
- Bravura!
- You take Payne alive if there's anything left.

744
01:31:06,642 --> 01:31:09,270
Calm down, BB.

745
01:31:15,375 --> 01:31:18,867
Holy shit!
Breaker, this is Air One.

746
01:31:33,459 --> 01:31:35,893
Run!

747
01:31:35,995 --> 01:31:37,895
Go! Go!

748
01:31:53,146 --> 01:31:55,341
<i>LaGuardia Tower, this is P.D. Air One.</i>

749
01:31:55,448 --> 01:31:57,678
<i>We have a major explosion</i>
<i>at the Aesir building.</i>

750

<i>Bravura! You all right?</i>

751
01:31:59,953 --> 01:32:02,615
- Get everybody upstairs! Now!
- Guys, that's our cue.

752
01:32:02,722 --> 01:32:06,123
Division One, upstairs! Right now!
On the double! Let's go!

753
01:32:10,363 --> 01:32:15,062
Where are you?

754
01:32:46,797 --> 01:32:50,062
It's unbelievable, all that snow.

755
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:52,567
And watch it end up
being a beautiful day.

756
01:32:56,073 --> 01:32:58,405
You want my confession first?

757
01:34:11,474 --> 01:34:14,500
<i>I don't know about heaven.</i>

758
01:34:20,483 --> 01:34:22,713
<i>But I do believe in angels.</i>

759
01:34:25,855 --> 01:34:28,756
Yeah. It's Daddy.

760

<i>- Hey, buddy.</i>
- Is that your daddy?

761
01:34:41,337 --> 01:34:44,101
Not yet, Max.

762
01:34:48,678 --> 01:34:52,705
We have him. Max Payne is alive.
He's okay. We got him.

763
01:41:38,521 --> 01:41:40,785
It's good to have you back.

764
01:42:13,622 --> 01:42:15,715
Hey.
