3
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,293
AEREON: They are an army
unlike any other.

4
00:01:25,377 --> 00:01:29,255
Crusading across the stars
toward a place called
UnderVerse,

5
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:33,426
their promised land.
A constellation
of dark new worlds.

6
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:37,138
Necromongers they're called.

7
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:41,225
And if they
cannot convert you,
they will kill you.

8
00:01:42,561 --> 00:01:45,271
Leading them,
the Lord Marshal.

9
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:50,276
He alone has made
a pilgrimage to the
gates of the UnderVerse

10
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,528
and returned
a different being.

11
00:01:54,198 --> 00:01:58,868
Stronger. Stranger.
Half alive and half

12
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,913
something else.

13
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,303
lf we are to survive,
a new balance must be found.

14
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:21,599
ln normal times, evil
would be fought by good.

15
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,559
But in times like these,

16
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:27,438
well, it should be fought
by another kind of evil.

17
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,641
Lining him up for you.

18
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,393
Portside shot coming up.

19
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:07,228
TOOMBS: Steady. Here we go.

20
00:03:14,528 --> 00:03:15,695
Steady.

21
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,450
Take it! Take a shot!

22
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:24,871
Shit.

23
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,957
Toombs,
we're running out of rope!
Shut up! I got it! Again !

24
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,753
Now!

25
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,258
HENCHMAN: Toombs!

26
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:52,440
Riddick.

27
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:58,446
GUNNER 1 : l don't know,
Toombs. Looks kind of tight.

28
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,283
Not where I'm sitting.
This is the biggest
payday ever.

29
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,661
So throw on a fresh
pair of panties.
Let's get this right.

30
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,300
HENCHMAN: Three meters
clearance portside. One
and a half meters starboard.

31
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,345
We got a chokepoint coming up.

32
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:37,109
HENCHMAN: What the shit
was that?

33
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:41,405
Tags, you got eyes on Riddick?

34
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,950
Tags?

35
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,414
Jesus.

36
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:55,086
He just ghosted two guys,
and l never even saw him.

37
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:58,673
What do you think?
Maybe we ought to just. . .

38
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,717
l think you're my new gunner.
Grab a Gat.

39
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,520
Stay on top of him this time.

40
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,924
RlDDlCK: You made
three mistakes.

41
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,805
First, you took the job.

42
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:50,975
Second, you came light.

43
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:55,146
A four-man crew for me?
Fucking insulting.

44
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,231
But the worst mistake
you made. . .

45
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:02,695
RlDDlCK: Empty gun rack.

46
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,036
What's the bounty on my head?
1 mil.

47
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,415
1 .5.

48
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:17,543
What slam pays
1 .5 for a convict?

49
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,336
Private party.

50
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,759
Guy! Easy! Anonymous.
That's what the sheet said.

51
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,552
What planet?

52
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,680
Helion Prime.

53
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,441
Whoa. Where you going?
Last question.

54
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:43,402
And you better get this one
right, merc.

55
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,030
Whose ship is this?

56
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:48,491
Mine?

57
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,097
RlDDlCK: Knew
they'd come for me.

58
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,891
Took them five years,
but l knew.

59
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:19,105
You don't expect these mercs
to have any honor, any code.

60
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,859
But this new bounty
from a holy man,

61
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:27,363
a guy whose neck l saved.

62
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:33,619
Well, lesson learned.
No such word as "friend."

63
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:37,873
Can only end bad when you
let someone get too close.

64
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,544
Bad for them.

65
00:07:43,547 --> 00:07:48,134
So now it's back
to all the brightness,
and everything l hate.

66
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:52,721
l wonder if she'll be there.

67
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,192
Act like an animal
and l'm gonna slot
you up like one.

68
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,236
This one is always
in trouble.

69
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,572
l knew it. l smell it.

70
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,428
Get in there!

71
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,664
Can we shut the goddamn noise?

72
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:36,200
RlDDlCK: They say most of your
brain shuts down in cryosleep.

73
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,494
SHlRAH: Brain shuts down
in cryosleep.

74
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:43,165
All but the primitive side.

75
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,833
The animal side.

76
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,587
SHlRAH: All but the Furyan
side.

77
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,262
Some of us still remember
the true crime

78
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:58,430
that happened here on Furya.

79
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:03,435
And once you wake,

80
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,522
truly wake,

81
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:11,402
you'll remember, too.

82
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,119
WOMAN PlLOT: Helion
Prime is on alert condition
four.

83
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:22,955
All unrecognized craft
will be escorted
to the ground

84
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,748
for security inspections.

85
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,793
PlLOT: Unrecognized craft,
follow me to Spaceport 6

86
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,503
for security inspections.

87
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:36,010
Do you hear me?
Follow me to
Spaceport 6 now!

88
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,228
WOMAN: lmam, pray for us.

89
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:31,190
WOMAN 1 : lt was confirmed
two seasons back. Yes.

90
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,193
WOMAN 2: They're coming here.
Are we next?

91
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,486
MAN 1 : Militants storm.

92
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,614
WOMAN 3: We're going
to the underground
shelters if it happens.

93
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,699
MAN 2: That's what l heard,
too.

94
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,285
MAN 3: Are you staying
or leaving?

95
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,538
MAN 4: lt's the end
of everything. Everything !

96
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,750
MAN 5: My neighbors. . .
MAN 6: Half my street is gone.

97
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:52,544
What are we gonna do?
l don't know.

98
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,005
WOMAN 4: Hood of the devil,
they called them.

99
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,091
WOMAN 5: Who is them?
WOMAN 4: A new creature.

100
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:59,593
MAN 7: lt's all nonsense.
Everyone is over-reacting.

101
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,346
MAN 8: . . .so tall
that it touches the clouds.

102
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,891
And there's nothing around
this statue, this colossus.

103
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,977
Nothing left.
lt's their calling card.

104
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,573
RlDDlCK: Did you know
all your doors were locked?

105
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,292
Five years ago,
l took two people
off that planet.

106
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:37,131
A kid, Jack,
who everyone else
thought was a boy

107
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:42,636
and a holy man
searching for New Mecca.

108
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,350
Your wife.

109
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:52,020
She's in the shower.

110
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:58,152
l told one man
where l might go.

111
00:13:00,238 --> 00:13:03,782
l showed trust to one man.

112
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,202
Did l make a mistake, lmam?

113
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,289
There is no simple answer. . .

114
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,418
Whatever was said was
meant to give us a chance.

115
00:13:14,961 --> 00:13:16,712
A fighting chance.

116
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,339
Were it not for the threat
of invasion

117
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,092
l never would
have betrayed you.
l give you my word, Riddick.

118
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:23,385
Riddick!

119
00:13:27,265 --> 00:13:28,557
Riddick.

120
00:13:31,102 --> 00:13:32,561
RlDDlCK: And a daughter. . .

121
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,150
LAJJUN: No.
RlDDlCK: . . .whose name
would be. . .

122
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,694
lf you have issue with me,
you let it be with me.

123
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,738
You need not know their names.

124
00:13:42,906 --> 00:13:46,909
Ziza. My name is Ziza.

125
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,537
Ziza.

126
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,124
Cute kid.

127
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,418
ZlZA: Did you really
kill monsters?

128
00:13:56,628 --> 00:13:59,296
The ones that were gonna
hurt my father?

129
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:03,342
Such are our bedtime stories.

130
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:05,511
Go, Ziza. Go on.

131
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:14,269
So now who do
l have to kill to get
this payday off my head?

132
00:14:30,745 --> 00:14:34,456
lMAM: lt is said the comet
always precedes them.

133
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,000
These world-enders.

134
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:44,675
The Coalsack planets are gone.
Eight million settlers
missing.

135
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,761
The entire Aquilan System
is gone, too.

136
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,266
Helion Prime
shares its sunlight
with all worlds nearby.

137
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,063
lf we fall, they fall.

138
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:01,149
And after that. . .

139
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,195
My God,
how do l save my family?

140
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:13,287
Have you heard
anything l've said?

141
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:18,333
You said it's all circling
the drain. The whole universe.

142
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,669
Right?
That's right.

143
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,346
Had to end sometime.

144
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,241
The one you want is now here.

145
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,386
And whose throat is this?

146
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,348
lf you cut my throat,

147
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:17,643
l'll not be able
to rescind the offer
that brought you here.

148
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,145
Nor tell you
why it's so vital
that you did come.

149
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,397
The blade comes off
when the bounty comes off.

150
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:26,193
This is Aereon. An envoy
from the Elemental race.

151
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,779
She means you no harm.

152
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,242
There are very few of us

153
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:37,204
who have met a Necromonger
and lived to speak of it.

154
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:41,583
So when
l choose to speak of it,
you should choose to listen.

155
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,293
Necromonger.

156
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,297
lt is the name
that will convert or kill

157
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,174
every last human life.

158
00:16:49,592 --> 00:16:52,135
Unless the universe
can rebalance itself.

159
00:16:53,805 --> 00:16:55,681
Maybe
you should pretend
like you're talking to

160
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:58,225
someone educated
in the penal system.

161
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:01,019
ln fact, don't pretend.

162
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:04,523
Balance is everything
to Elementals.

163
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:07,025
Water to fire. Earth to air.

164
00:17:07,485 --> 00:17:09,611
We have 33 different words
for it.

165
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,363
But now we have only time

166
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,657
to speak of the balance
of opposites.

167
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,119
lMAM: There is a story,
Riddick, of young male
Furyans

168
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,873
strangled at birth.
Strangled with their
own cords.

169
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:27,546
When Aereon told this story
to the Helion leaders,

170
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,047
l told her of you.

171
00:17:29,132 --> 00:17:30,716
What do you know
of your early years?

172
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,677
Do you remember
your homeworld?
Where it was?

173
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:36,847
Have you met any others?
Others like yourself.

174
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,936
Sister,
they don't know what
to do with just one of me.

175
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,524
SOLDlER 1 : Open up in there!
Open up!
SOLDlER 2: Stand back!

176
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,736
LAJJUN: They are searching
houses.

177
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,571
They look for a man
who came here today.

178
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,740
They think he might be a spy.
A spy.

179
00:17:54,824 --> 00:17:57,242
Did someone see him
come here today? Did they?

180
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:58,827
Lajjun, stop!

181
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:03,206
l will send them away.
But wait one minute,
please.

182
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,376
Will you wait
one minute to
save worlds?

183
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:09,337
Not my fight.

184
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,966
So you will leave us
to our fate?

185
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,553
Just like you did her.
SOLDlER 1 : Break it down !

186
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:21,850
SOLDlER 1 : Get in !

187
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:24,352
Come, let us try
to send them away.

188
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,565
LAJJUN: Let me have her!
SOLDlER 1 : Come on.

189
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:29,983
CLERlC: Leave us alone.

190
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:33,612
LAJJUN: There is no one here.

191
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:37,032
CLERlC: You don't understand.
He can help us!

192
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:52,464
You're not afraid
of the dark, are you?

193
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:14,694
SOLDlER 1 : Get him !
SOLDlER 2: Where is he?

194
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,947
SOLDlER 3: ln here.

195
00:19:44,934 --> 00:19:46,643
You mentioned her.

196
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:49,437
She. . .

197
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,816
She went looking for you.

198
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:56,027
People died.
She went to prison.

199
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,281
l don't remember where.

200
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:05,287
But it was a world
so hot, you couldn't
survive on the surface.

201
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,455
Crematoria.

202
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,459
Young Jack. She thought
of you as her older brother.

203
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:15,297
She worshipped you.
You were supposed
to watch her.

204
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,801
She never forgave you
for leaving

205
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:22,804
just when she
needed you most.

206
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,473
She needed to
stay away from me.

207
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:27,809
You all do.

208
00:20:29,687 --> 00:20:31,104
ZlZA: Riddick.

209
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,319
Are you gonna stop
the new monsters now?

210
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,293
AEREON: Furyans.
Defiant to the end.

211
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:34,834
No, no.
We go to the shelter.

212
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,171
We take only ourselves.

213
00:21:53,354 --> 00:21:55,647
OFFlClAL: Turn back!
Go to the other shelter.

214
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,815
MAN: There is no room.

215
00:21:56,899 --> 00:21:59,275
WOMAN: They won't let us in !
OFFlClAL: Get back.

216
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,778
lMAM: Stay close.

217
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:50,970
CONTROLLER: Flight leaders,
all squads off the ground
now.

218
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:52,764
We have heavy inbound.

219
00:23:55,017 --> 00:23:56,434
Follow me in!

220
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,027
They're coming back!

221
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,205
lMAM: The next shelter.
This way!

222
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,025
lMAM: l'll see if it's safe.

223
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,533
lMAM: Stay back.
LAJJUN: Come, Ziza.

224
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,054
Come!

225
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,826
You following me?

226
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,698
lMAM: Lajjun and Ziza!

227
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,450
When it's over.

228
00:26:17,493 --> 00:26:20,495
Let me go.
l must go to my family.
When it's over.

229
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,650
l borrowed a ship.

230
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,987
You can ride along
if you don't mind
riding with a convict.

231
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:57,031
l thank you,
but l must get my
family across the river.

232
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,284
God willing, there is still
a shelter l can get them. . .

233
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,536
l'm sure God
has his tricks.

234
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:04,914
But getting out of
places no one else can,

235
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,749
that's one of mine.

236
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,253
Let's get your family.

237
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,164
ln here.

238
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,000
lMAM: Get in.

239
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,947
LAJJUN: lmam.
Don't follow me.

240
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,002
There will be an afterlife
for me.

241
00:30:40,631 --> 00:30:42,548
Will there be for you?

242
00:32:00,669 --> 00:32:02,795
Let's go replenish the ranks.

243
00:32:16,351 --> 00:32:21,063
Never fails
to inspire, does it?
Each time a dynasty falls.

244
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:24,358
Remember your place,
Dame Vaako.

245
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,737
My place is at your side,
dear husband.

246
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,281
From here
till UnderVerse come.

247
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:56,932
ln this 'verse,

248
00:32:57,934 --> 00:33:01,812
life is antagonistic
to the natural state.

249
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:07,526
Here, humans in all
their various races

250
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:10,738
are a spontaneous outbreak,

251
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,783
an unguided mistake.

252
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:19,121
Our purpose is to
correct that mistake.

253
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:23,584
Because there
is another 'verse.

254
00:33:24,586 --> 00:33:28,923
A 'verse where life
is welcomed and cherished.

255
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:32,718
A ravishing,
ever-new place

256
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,595
called UnderVerse.

257
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,308
But the road to that 'verse

258
00:33:40,602 --> 00:33:42,645
crosses over the threshold.

259
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:46,065
NECROMONGERS: Threshold !
Take us to the threshold !

260
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,110
What you call death.

261
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,533
PURlFlER: So it is
this 'verse that must
be cleansed of life

262
00:33:55,617 --> 00:33:59,120
so that UnderVerse
can populate and prosper.

263
00:34:02,416 --> 00:34:03,666
Look around you.

264
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,877
Every Necromonger
in this hall,

265
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:08,713
every one
of the Legion Vast

266
00:34:08,797 --> 00:34:11,966
that just swept aside
your defenses in one night

267
00:34:12,217 --> 00:34:13,801
was once like you.

268
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,221
Fought as feebly as you.

269
00:34:18,265 --> 00:34:23,227
Every Necromonger that
lives today is a convert.

270
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,895
There'll be no conversions!

271
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:27,982
We all began
as something else!

272
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:34,655
lt was hard for me to accept,
too, when l first heard
these words.

273
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:36,824
But l changed.

274
00:34:37,993 --> 00:34:40,619
l let them take away my pain.

275
00:34:40,704 --> 00:34:41,912
You betrayed your faith.

276
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:44,790
Just as you will change

277
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:49,754
when you realize
that the threshold to the
UnderVerse will be crossed

278
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:54,175
only by those
who have embraced
the Necromonger faith.

279
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:57,386
For those of you
who will right now

280
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:01,766
drop to your knees
and ask to be purified.

281
00:35:01,850 --> 00:35:03,225
We will not renounce
our faith !

282
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:05,936
No one here will
do what you ask.

283
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,314
lt is unthinkable!

284
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:12,359
This is a world
of many peoples,
many religions!

285
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:17,531
And we simply cannot
and will not be converted.

286
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:20,367
MARSHAL: Then l'll take
your soul.

287
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,589
MARSHAL: Join him

288
00:35:35,926 --> 00:35:37,301
or join me.

289
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,074
This is your one chance.

290
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:03,577
Take the Lord Marshal's offer
and bow.

291
00:36:04,663 --> 00:36:06,247
l bow to no man.

292
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,839
He's not a man.

293
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,676
He's the holy Half-Dead
who has seen the UnderVerse.

294
00:36:19,052 --> 00:36:21,428
Look,
l'm not with everyone here.

295
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,932
But l will take
a piece of him.

296
00:36:31,481 --> 00:36:33,357
A piece you will have.

297
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,803
MARSHAL: Stop him !

298
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:18,277
lrgun. One of my best.

299
00:37:19,112 --> 00:37:20,571
lf you say so.

300
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,827
What do you think
of this blade?

301
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:38,923
l think
it's a half-gram
heavy on the back end.

302
00:37:39,049 --> 00:37:42,384
ln our faith,
you keep what you kill.

303
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:52,019
Are you familiar to me?

304
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,775
Have we met
on some distant field?

305
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,528
You'd think l'd remember.

306
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,865
You'd think l would, too.

307
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,869
Take him before
the Quasi-Deads.

308
00:38:16,461 --> 00:38:18,879
Perhaps the breeder
would do it

309
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:22,174
if somebody just asked him.

310
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,929
lt is a rare offer.

311
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:31,809
A visit inside Necropolis.

312
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,398
lt's been a long time
since l smelled beautiful.

313
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,734
Let me show you the way.

314
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:37,833
Beautiful eyes. Come.

315
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,631
The last
six Lord Marshals
have called this home.

316
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,509
Magnificent, isn't it?

317
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,304
l might have
gone a different way.

318
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,097
True of us all.

319
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:57,728
Converts receiving the mark
of the Necromonger.

320
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,817
They learn how one pain
can lessen another.

321
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,333
There now.

322
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:25,005
That is just perfect.

323
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:31,386
The more you resist them

324
00:40:31,721 --> 00:40:34,056
the greater the damage
will be.

325
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:38,268
QUASl-DEADS: A new one.

326
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:41,897
You've brought us a new one.

327
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,872
lnteresting breeder.

328
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,223
QUASl-DEADS: Making entry.

329
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:19,393
This won't take long.

330
00:41:20,687 --> 00:41:23,772
We've entered his neocortex.

331
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,526
QUASl-DEADS: The Riddick!
Regress.

332
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:30,988
Scanning fresh memories.

333
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:34,449
Thoughts of someone
called Jack.

334
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:36,410
Riddick!

335
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,081
lMAM: She went to prison.

336
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:45,252
QUASl-DEADS: Now we find
thoughts of an Elemental.

337
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,255
The one race
that would slow the
spread of Necromongers.

338
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,548
lMAM: Furyans.

339
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,258
QUASl-DEADS: Furyans.

340
00:41:55,972 --> 00:41:58,015
Where does he come from?

341
00:41:58,099 --> 00:42:02,227
Who are his people?
These are the things
l need to know.

342
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,274
QUASl-DEADS: We find energy.

343
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,279
SHlRAH: You must settle
your past.

344
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,866
QUASl-DEADS: We find
Furyan energy.

345
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,160
For all of us.

346
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,620
QUASl-DEADS: He's Furyan!

347
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:21,997
Furyan!

348
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,293
A Furyan survivor!

349
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,963
SHlRAH: Look at our world,

350
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,592
at the graves
of those who didn't
escape 30 years ago.

351
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,803
There is no future
until we settle our past.

352
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:42,059
For all of us
who bear the mark.

353
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:46,980
QUASl-DEADS:
Kill the Furyan!
Kill the Riddick!

354
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,902
Kill the Riddick.

355
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,354
Who is this man?

356
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:32,192
Find him. Whatever it takes.
Find him.

357
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:10,856
Let me guess.
A five-man crew this time.

358
00:44:11,816 --> 00:44:14,735
TOOMBS: Couple of things
you could have done better.

359
00:44:18,740 --> 00:44:23,410
First, trash the locater
beacon inside my ship,
the one you jacked.

360
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,955
And second,
and this is really
the more important part,

361
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:30,417
dust my dick
when you get the chance.

362
00:44:31,127 --> 00:44:33,420
Any questions?
Yeah.

363
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,592
What took you so long?

364
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,601
Let's go, big boy.

365
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:03,075
ln and out.
Unsuspected and undetected.

366
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:05,285
Damn, l love a good
smash-and-grab!

367
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:08,413
Not so fast, dickheads.

368
00:45:08,498 --> 00:45:09,915
We're picking up fields here.

369
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:11,792
ELECTRONlC VOlCE: Unknown
fields detected on hull.

370
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:16,171
l knew it. Here it comes.
This is some kind of scan.

371
00:45:16,756 --> 00:45:18,965
l don't know.
Reading our BTUs, maybe?

372
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:22,010
Let's drop one.
Dropping.

373
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:32,479
ELECTRONlC VOlCE:
Decoy launched.

374
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:40,153
Preparing to engage
ion drive.

375
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:44,157
So where do we drop
your merc-killing ass?

376
00:45:44,826 --> 00:45:48,495
Who's gonna pay the most
for you now? Butcher Bay?

377
00:45:48,621 --> 00:45:50,163
Butcher Bay.

378
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,459
Ten minutes every other day
on the dog-run.

379
00:45:54,544 --> 00:45:56,795
Protein waffles aren't bad.

380
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:01,341
How about Ursa Luna?
Nice little double-max prison.

381
00:46:01,509 --> 00:46:05,637
They keep
a cell open for me,
just in case l drop in.

382
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,931
You know the problem
with these joints now?

383
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,350
Health clubs for
waffle-eating pussies.

384
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:13,353
Maybe we should think
about upping our game
here a little bit.

385
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,856
Think about someplace
truly diabolical.

386
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:17,732
What the hell
is he thinking now?

387
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:21,945
RlDDlCK: He's thinking
a triple-max prison.
A no-daylight slam.

388
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,822
Only three of them
left in this system,

389
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,157
two of them out of range

390
00:46:25,241 --> 00:46:28,368
for a shitty
little undercutter
like this one with no legs.

391
00:46:28,453 --> 00:46:31,079
Leaving just one.

392
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:33,582
Crematoria.

393
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,627
That is what you had in mind,
right, Toombs?

394
00:46:37,712 --> 00:46:40,464
How does he know
where we're going,
and we don't?

395
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,632
Dope it out.
l hate this run.

396
00:46:42,717 --> 00:46:44,718
Just do it!

397
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,304
Don't know about
this new crew of yours.

398
00:46:47,388 --> 00:46:49,306
They seem a bit skittish.

399
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:53,101
Probably
shouldn't tell them what
happened to the last crew.

400
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:05,071
You know,
you were supposed to
be some slick-shit killer.

401
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,952
Now look at you.
All back-of-the-bus and shit.

402
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:50,909
SCALES: l say
we attack Helion Two next.

403
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,911
Take it straight
into their teeth.

404
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:54,663
lt'll cost you 20,000 heads,

405
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:56,498
5 Warrior Ships, nothing more,
l swear it.

406
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:59,960
While l do
prize brute force,

407
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:03,505
this approach is,
perhaps, more artful.

408
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,382
Start at the end.

409
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:10,387
Go straight to Helion Five,
the last planet in the system.

410
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,139
We approach
from the night side.

411
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:17,644
Remove these cannon first,
then attack the larger
placements at speed.

412
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,814
We'll catch them
on their rear flank.

413
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:22,440
And in 1 0 days' time,

414
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:25,527
the rest of those worlds
will tumble before us.

415
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:31,908
You see, as with most,
their blind spot is
right behind them.

416
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:36,746
l've located an ion trail
which leads off-world.

417
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,332
Then you should be off-world,
Vaako.

418
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:42,043
l've deployed a tracker team.
One of the best.

419
00:48:42,128 --> 00:48:44,004
Wherever Riddick has gone,

420
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,465
you lens him out
and cleanse him. You.

421
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,760
You want me to take
a frigate for one breeder?

422
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,846
Don't question it, Vaako!

423
00:48:55,516 --> 00:48:58,184
Take it on faith.

424
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,524
DAME VAAKO:
He's always been
unsettled around you.

425
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,820
The Lord Marshal.
Unsteady.

426
00:49:09,989 --> 00:49:13,450
Perhaps because he knows
he's half the warrior you are.

427
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:16,745
Some say he's too
artistic for the job.

428
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:21,875
l wouldn't be surprised
if someone promoted
him soon

429
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,668
to full dead.

430
00:49:26,714 --> 00:49:28,548
Take care what you say.

431
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,634
Should l say it softly?

432
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:33,928
So it sounds
more like conspiracy?

433
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:37,098
Why is it that when anyone
breathes about the demise

434
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:40,310
of him on the throne
everyone assumes a conspiracy?

435
00:49:42,730 --> 00:49:46,107
Why isn't that
just prudent planning?

436
00:49:46,275 --> 00:49:48,860
When he is ready,
he will name a successor.

437
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,028
Who?

438
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,073
Toal? Scales?

439
00:49:53,908 --> 00:49:55,367
The Purifier?

440
00:49:55,743 --> 00:49:57,369
None of them

441
00:49:57,495 --> 00:50:00,455
with the strength,
the dignity

442
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,415
of Lord Vaako.

443
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,586
You can keep
what you kill.

444
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:07,837
Stop.

445
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:10,006
That is the Necromonger way.

446
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,967
l said stop.

447
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:17,055
His death will come
in due time and not
a moment sooner.

448
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:18,306
Why?

449
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:20,308
Because l serve him.
We all serve him.

450
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:23,061
lt's called fidelity.
lt's called stupidity.

451
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,614
Well, finally,
some attention.

452
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,797
You have such greatness
in you.

453
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,799
lf only you could see it
like l do.

454
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:57,971
You know what l want?

455
00:50:59,515 --> 00:51:03,184
Today l came up behind him
in perfect silence
and he knew.

456
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,230
l want to go down
to Necropolis.

457
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,649
Right now.

458
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:13,445
His half-dead soul
sensed l was behind him.

459
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:15,071
He sees everything.

460
00:51:15,156 --> 00:51:18,700
When no one is looking,
when no one's around,

461
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:22,495
l'm gonna get down
on my knees

462
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:27,500
while you sit
on the throne.

463
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:51,691
MARSHAL: How unexpected. . .

464
00:51:51,776 --> 00:51:54,444
An Elemental. Here?

465
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,362
VAAKO: One of the captives.

466
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:02,827
And why,
after 30 years,
should it be you?

467
00:52:02,912 --> 00:52:05,622
He doesn't regard her
as a captive, though.

468
00:52:05,706 --> 00:52:08,124
Elementals.
They talk of neutrality,

469
00:52:08,209 --> 00:52:09,959
but they're
all witches and spies.

470
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:13,046
Why else
would they come
and go like the wind?

471
00:52:13,422 --> 00:52:17,383
MARSHAL: But where
has he gone? Where is
the Furyan hiding now?

472
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,679
You be
the good warrior.
Go after this Riddick.

473
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:26,976
l'll find out
why the Lord Marshal
is so threatened by him.

474
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,623
Do you know you grind
your teeth at night?

475
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,335
Sexy.

476
00:53:50,019 --> 00:53:53,813
ELECTRONlC VOlCE:
Destination reached.
Unlocking manual controls.

477
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:56,649
All right, l make 700
degrees on the day side.

478
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,903
300 below on the night side.

479
00:53:59,987 --> 00:54:02,071
PlLOT: Let's not
get caught in the sun.

480
00:54:02,823 --> 00:54:07,076
lf l owned
this place and hell,
l'd rent this place out

481
00:54:07,161 --> 00:54:08,369
and live in hell.

482
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:19,881
ELECTRONlC VOlCE:
Slue angle: good.
Stand by.

483
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:25,136
And. . .
Plotted course, good.

484
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,471
Hit it!

485
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:31,017
Angle of approach:
not good.

486
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:41,152
Look, Ma, no hands!

487
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:17,522
Party poppers!

488
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,171
l think l shit myself.

489
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:46,926
Skittish, Toombs.
Very skittish.

490
00:56:09,033 --> 00:56:10,283
Comfy?

491
00:56:28,677 --> 00:56:33,598
When the ride's over,
your goggles are mine.

492
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:04,253
Four-way split!

493
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,309
29.4 kilometers.

494
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,238
So this is Riddick.

495
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,226
What in the bowels of Christ
are you talking about?
700,000?

496
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,395
Don't take this one, boss.

497
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,231
See, Anatoli here
has a nose for trouble.

498
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,525
And this one,
this Riddick guy. . .

499
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,569
Big, big trouble.

500
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:12,572
So 700,000 is good money.

501
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,408
l'd take the money, Toombs.

502
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,463
The guild
pays us a caretaker's fee
for each prisoner each year.

503
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,259
We pay mercs 20%
of that total fee based
on a certain life expectancy.

504
00:58:33,594 --> 00:58:35,094
TOOMBS: How's about this?

505
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:38,472
You open that
safe you got hidden
behind the console there,

506
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:41,642
show me the real books.
Then we figure out my cut.

507
00:58:41,727 --> 00:58:43,394
Then l'll be on my way.

508
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:52,486
Open my books.
This is what you suggest?

509
00:58:57,409 --> 00:58:58,951
Wasn't a suggestion.

510
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:21,641
BOSS: These are dangerous
days, if you believe the talk.

511
00:59:22,851 --> 00:59:26,103
Talk?
BOSS: About dead planets.

512
00:59:26,355 --> 00:59:29,315
About some ghost army.

513
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,984
About them.

514
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,861
Them?

515
00:59:51,797 --> 00:59:55,841
l'll run the numbers again.
lt takes a couple of days
probably.

516
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,345
So you can stay
as my guest.

517
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,432
At least here we
are all safe. Yes?

518
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:05,059
GUARD: Yes, boss.

519
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,561
l'll give it a day.

520
01:00:10,399 --> 01:00:11,482
One.

521
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:54,150
GUV: There are inmates,
and there are convicts.

522
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,321
A convict has a certain code.

523
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:02,908
And he knows to
show a certain respect.

524
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,537
An inmate,
on the other hand,

525
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,332
pulls the pin
on his fellow man.

526
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:13,336
Does the guards' work
for them. Brings shame. . .

527
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:16,297
. . .to the game.

528
01:01:17,966 --> 01:01:20,051
So which are you gonna be?

529
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:22,636
Me?

530
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:27,933
l'm just passing through.

531
01:01:34,441 --> 01:01:36,317
Welcome to Crematoria.

532
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,533
Should l go for
the sweet spot?

533
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:48,371
Left of the spine,
fourth lumbar down
the abdominal aorta.

534
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:50,039
What a gusher.

535
01:01:53,585 --> 01:01:55,211
How do l get
eyes like that?

536
01:01:55,295 --> 01:01:57,171
You got to
kill a few people.

537
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,634
Did that.
Did a lot of that.

538
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,930
And then you got to
get sent to a slam.

539
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,848
Where you're told you
won't see daylight again?

540
01:02:07,933 --> 01:02:09,892
There wasn't a doctor
who could shine my eyes

541
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,812
not even
for 20 menthol Kools.
Was anything you said true?

542
01:02:16,024 --> 01:02:19,443
What are you gonna do?
Go for the sweet spot?

543
01:02:19,528 --> 01:02:22,738
Remember who you're
talking to, Jack.

544
01:02:24,491 --> 01:02:25,908
Jack's dead.

545
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,077
She was weak.

546
01:02:30,038 --> 01:02:31,205
She couldn't cut it.

547
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:46,512
The name's Kyra now.

548
01:02:47,347 --> 01:02:49,181
And l'm a new animal.

549
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,012
They can be quite a test.

550
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,347
These deep runs.

551
01:03:31,892 --> 01:03:33,726
Test of our inner selves.

552
01:03:36,104 --> 01:03:37,771
Don't you find that true?

553
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:44,236
Some men do.

554
01:03:46,490 --> 01:03:48,574
PURlFlER: Just being
so far from the armada,

555
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:52,995
the mind can start to
fill with strange thoughts.

556
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,246
Doubts.

557
01:03:55,123 --> 01:03:57,249
Don't you ever have doubts,
Vaako?

558
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:03,422
Doubts?
About the campaign.

559
01:04:04,466 --> 01:04:05,966
About Lord Marshal.

560
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:12,598
First and always, l am
a Necromonger commander.

561
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:16,185
So if you're here
to test my loyalty,

562
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:18,771
you succeed only in
testing my patience.

563
01:04:19,064 --> 01:04:22,274
No, that's not
why l'm here at all.

564
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:47,216
DAME VAAKO: l'm so glad
l could steal you away
for a moment.

565
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,385
Doesn't it strike you odd?

566
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:55,224
Here we have the current
Lord Marshal destroying
entire societies

567
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:59,895
and yet he can't
bring himself to kill
one stranded Elemental.

568
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,981
Why is that?

569
01:05:03,483 --> 01:05:07,444
You don't pray to our God.
You pray to no God, l hear.

570
01:05:08,154 --> 01:05:11,240
Elementals, we calculate.

571
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,243
Don't we all.

572
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,205
But now let's have
first things first.

573
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:19,832
What of Riddick?

574
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,667
ln truth,
l don't know
where he went.

575
01:05:21,751 --> 01:05:24,628
ln truth,
l'm more interested
in where he came from.

576
01:05:28,008 --> 01:05:29,842
Watch your step.

577
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:33,095
l've always wondered,
does an air Elemental fly?

578
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,140
Now do me a favor.

579
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:39,810
Calculate the odds of you
getting off this planet
alive

580
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,188
and now cut them in half.

581
01:05:44,733 --> 01:05:48,611
No, we can't fly.
But we glide very well.

582
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,572
Save your threats,
Necromonger.

583
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:55,242
l would have told you
about Riddick for the
asking.

584
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,620
lt concerns a foretelling,

585
01:05:57,704 --> 01:06:00,164
a prediction now
more than 30 years old.

586
01:06:00,248 --> 01:06:03,375
A young warrior
once consulted a seer.

587
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:08,505
He was told a child would
be born on the planet
Furya, a male child

588
01:06:09,215 --> 01:06:12,926
who would someday
cause the warrior's downfall.

589
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:16,555
QUASl-DEADS:
Cause his untimed death.

590
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:21,644
VAAKO: Furya?
Furya's a ruined world.

591
01:06:21,728 --> 01:06:23,479
No life to speak of.

592
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:25,272
For good reason.

593
01:06:25,357 --> 01:06:29,610
This young warrior
mounted an attack
on Furya,

594
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:32,321
killing all young males
he could find,

595
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:36,450
even strangling some
with their birth cords.

596
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:40,329
QUASl-DEADS: An artful
stroke, wouldn't you say?

597
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,958
So this warrior,
the one who tried
to outwit the prediction

598
01:06:45,043 --> 01:06:46,502
would later become. . .

599
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:48,420
That's why he worries.

600
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,047
. . .our Lord Marshal.

601
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:53,842
Which would make
the man-child. . .

602
01:06:53,927 --> 01:06:56,762
He worries he missed
killing that child
in its crib.

603
01:06:57,681 --> 01:06:58,681
. . . Riddick!

604
01:07:15,573 --> 01:07:18,117
QUASl-DEADS: That's why
it's vital to him.
Wait.

605
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,452
QUASl-DEADS: lt's
about a prophecy.
Wait!

606
01:07:23,206 --> 01:07:24,790
QUASl-DEADS: Are you there?

607
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:30,921
You do what your lord asks.

608
01:07:31,256 --> 01:07:37,636
You cleanse Riddick for him,
and in doing so, you prove
your undying loyalty.

609
01:07:38,221 --> 01:07:40,222
And perhaps then

610
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,642
he'll finally let down
his guard.

611
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,645
GUV: Still here, l see.

612
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:32,149
l've been here 1 8 years.
See this?

613
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:35,944
l remember
how gorgeous she was.

614
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:39,156
Well,
gorgeous in
a certain light.

615
01:08:40,074 --> 01:08:44,995
And now, for
the goddamn death of me,
l cannot remember her name.

616
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,872
GUARD: Feeding time!

617
01:08:52,921 --> 01:08:55,839
We're here for the rest
of our unnatural lives.

618
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,891
Here they come!

619
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:14,775
Whatever you do,
don't make eye contact.

620
01:09:34,712 --> 01:09:36,171
CONVlCT 1 : To the cages!

621
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:05,617
CONVlCT 2: Let me in !

622
01:11:41,089 --> 01:11:42,881
lt's an animal thing.

623
01:11:53,893 --> 01:11:57,562
GUARD 1 : Check her for me.
She's always got a blade
somewhere.

624
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:59,750
RlDDlCK: l don't think
she likes being touched.

625
01:13:02,336 --> 01:13:06,048
l'd take my wounded and
go while you still can.

626
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:15,682
ls there a name for
this private little
world of yours?

627
01:13:17,101 --> 01:13:20,562
What happens there
when we don't just
run away?

628
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:23,523
You'll kill us
with a soup cup?

629
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,902
Tea, actually.

630
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:28,487
What's that?

631
01:13:30,782 --> 01:13:32,949
l'll kill you
with my tea cup.

632
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,339
GUARD 1 : You know the rule.

633
01:13:47,423 --> 01:13:50,425
They aren't dead
if they're still
on the books.

634
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,488
Come on.

635
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:35,971
Death by tea cup.

636
01:14:40,726 --> 01:14:43,395
Damn.
Why didn't l think of that?

637
01:14:43,563 --> 01:14:46,106
l didn't come here to play
"Who's The Better Killer?"

638
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:49,151
But it's my favorite game.
Haven't you heard?

639
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:51,194
l heard you came looking
for me.

640
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:54,072
ls that all?
Then you missed the good part.

641
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:56,992
Hooked up with some
mercs out of Lupus Five.

642
01:14:57,076 --> 01:15:00,871
Said they'd take me on,
teach me the trade,
give me a good cut.

643
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,665
They slaved me out, Riddick.

644
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,209
Do you know
what that could do to
you when you're that age?

645
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:09,963
When you're 1 2 years old?
l told you to
stay in New Mecca.

646
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,090
Did you not listen?

647
01:15:13,134 --> 01:15:16,761
l had mercs on my neck.
l'll always have mercs
on my neck.

648
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:21,808
l spent five years
on a frozen heap just
to keep them away from you.

649
01:15:22,310 --> 01:15:25,020
And you go and sign up
with the same fake badges

650
01:15:25,104 --> 01:15:27,189
that wanted to cut you up
and use you for bait.

651
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,566
What are you pitching,
Riddick?

652
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,776
That you cutting out
was a good thing?

653
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:35,197
That you had my ass
covered from halfway
across the universe?

654
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:37,282
You signed with mercs.

655
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,955
There was nobody else around.

656
01:15:58,679 --> 01:16:01,640
Let's pop the cork.
Get some fresh air.

657
01:16:38,594 --> 01:16:40,845
So they do go topside

658
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:43,807
to swap out air.

659
01:16:45,059 --> 01:16:46,476
lnteresting.

660
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:49,396
Who the hell are you?

661
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,109
When it happens,
it'll happen fast.

662
01:16:54,193 --> 01:16:57,612
Stay on my leg
when l cut fence,
or stay here.

663
01:16:58,197 --> 01:17:00,407
For the rest of
your unnatural life.

664
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:03,743
Nobody outs this place.
Nobody.

665
01:17:10,209 --> 01:17:11,876
KYRA: He ain't nobody.

666
01:17:26,559 --> 01:17:28,101
BOSS: Good news first.

667
01:17:28,227 --> 01:17:30,812
Talked things over
with my amigos here.

668
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:34,024
We'll cut you in for 775,000.

669
01:17:36,861 --> 01:17:39,696
All right.
What's the bad news?

670
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:42,198
They close
the local whorehouse?

671
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:47,370
BOSS: No. The bad news
is worse than that.
Much worse.

672
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:50,582
Our pilot, he saw this.

673
01:17:51,417 --> 01:17:53,543
lt crossed
a shipping lane.

674
01:17:56,088 --> 01:17:59,090
Any idea what this might be?

675
01:18:03,429 --> 01:18:05,430
Never saw nothing like it.

676
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,267
This ship charts
back to Helion Prime.

677
01:18:10,936 --> 01:18:14,022
You know, Anatoli's
got a nose for trouble

678
01:18:14,106 --> 01:18:17,692
and he thinks
trouble follows you here.

679
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,366
Look, we dusted our tracks
and got the hell out of there.

680
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:26,951
There is no way
we didn't lose them.

681
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:30,246
Them?

682
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:39,255
This is my prisoner.

683
01:18:39,632 --> 01:18:41,925
Mine. Nobody else's.

684
01:18:42,134 --> 01:18:44,386
And l want my money now.

685
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:50,809
You stole a prisoner
from them?

686
01:20:00,921 --> 01:20:03,006
TOOMBS: Riddick, no!

687
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:13,475
Should've taken the money,
Toombs.

688
01:21:08,906 --> 01:21:10,657
Are you going to kill me?

689
01:21:46,402 --> 01:21:47,694
Mercs.

690
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:51,531
Some guards here,
but this can't be
all of them.

691
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:55,493
Check their slots in the back.
And be careful.

692
01:21:56,036 --> 01:21:58,830
Don't bother.
Guards ain't there.

693
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:03,001
They figured out
the Necros are coming for me.

694
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:05,587
Plan was to clean the bank,
ghost the mercs,

695
01:22:05,671 --> 01:22:07,630
break wide
through the tunnel.

696
01:22:07,715 --> 01:22:11,926
Then somebody
got a lucky shot off with
this rocket launcher here

697
01:22:12,011 --> 01:22:13,928
and took out the sled.

698
01:22:14,221 --> 01:22:16,222
Guards took off on foot

699
01:22:16,307 --> 01:22:18,933
but rigged the door
so no one could follow.

700
01:22:19,018 --> 01:22:21,728
They'll take the one ship
in the hangar

701
01:22:22,396 --> 01:22:25,023
and leave everyone else
here to die.

702
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,525
How come
you know all this shit?

703
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,569
You weren't even here.

704
01:22:30,696 --> 01:22:32,530
'Cause it was my plan.

705
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:40,330
l should have
taken the money.

706
01:22:48,005 --> 01:22:49,631
Riddick!

707
01:23:00,184 --> 01:23:03,144
CONVlCT 1 :
What is this?
What is he thinking?

708
01:23:03,228 --> 01:23:05,146
CONVlCT 2: Once
that sun comes up. . .

709
01:23:05,230 --> 01:23:06,648
We'll last five minutes.

710
01:23:06,732 --> 01:23:10,652
Five minutes.
We ain't gonna last
30 seconds out there.

711
01:23:10,736 --> 01:23:12,737
lt'll light you up
like a match.

712
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:21,162
20-mile buffer zone and
30 klicks to the hangar.

713
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,250
30 klicks,
over that terrain?

714
01:23:39,515 --> 01:23:43,351
lt's moving in the right
direction. We could make it.

715
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,688
Stay behind the night,

716
01:23:47,189 --> 01:23:48,815
ahead of the sun.

717
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:51,609
There's gonna be one speed.

718
01:23:54,655 --> 01:23:55,780
Mine.

719
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,742
lf you can't keep up,
don't step up.

720
01:23:59,827 --> 01:24:01,077
You'll just die.

721
01:25:06,518 --> 01:25:11,689
Riddick!

722
01:25:15,152 --> 01:25:16,444
Riddick.

723
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:23,701
GUV: Go! Come on, go!

724
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:25,661
GUV: Climb here!

725
01:25:25,996 --> 01:25:28,122
GUV: Climb! Go!

726
01:25:54,608 --> 01:25:55,650
Boss!

727
01:25:59,404 --> 01:26:00,404
ANATOLl: Up there.

728
01:26:01,406 --> 01:26:04,033
Take a look.
Because Anatoli says so?

729
01:26:04,743 --> 01:26:06,869
Because his nose says so.

730
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:25,680
There's nothing up here.

731
01:26:40,445 --> 01:26:41,612
Riddick.

732
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:45,199
GUARD 1 : They're heading
for the volcano fields.

733
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:46,534
GUARD 2: Going for our ship!

734
01:26:46,618 --> 01:26:49,036
No chance do they get
to the hangar first.
No chance!

735
01:27:00,215 --> 01:27:02,717
GUARD 1 :
Next one! Next hole!
We'll catch them there!

736
01:27:31,163 --> 01:27:33,039
ANATOLl: No more running
for you.

737
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:40,713
Where did the big guy go?

738
01:28:14,665 --> 01:28:15,706
Close it!

739
01:28:48,115 --> 01:28:50,574
What was that?
You don't care
if you live or die?

740
01:28:50,701 --> 01:28:53,077
lf l kill them first,
not really.

741
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:56,789
Maybe l do.

742
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,083
Keep moving !

743
01:29:57,142 --> 01:29:58,267
RlDDlCK: Kyra?

744
01:30:00,479 --> 01:30:01,854
Kyra!
What?

745
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:04,940
Get that ass moving !

746
01:30:43,980 --> 01:30:45,189
Riddick?

747
01:30:50,028 --> 01:30:53,864
Remember what l said
about not caring
if l lived or died?

748
01:30:57,911 --> 01:31:00,204
You knew l was kidding,
right?

749
01:31:03,250 --> 01:31:04,625
One speed.

750
01:31:25,147 --> 01:31:26,939
Temperature differential.

751
01:31:27,732 --> 01:31:29,066
Your rope.

752
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:32,278
lt's too late.
We're never gonna make it.

753
01:31:32,362 --> 01:31:34,446
Your rope!
Give me your rope!

754
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,616
And your water. All of it!

755
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:42,663
Stay in the
shadow of the mountain.
Don't wait for me. Run !

756
01:31:54,176 --> 01:31:55,426
Riddick!

757
01:32:40,263 --> 01:32:42,473
GUARD 2: Where the hell
is that hangar?

758
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:49,647
GUV: There it is.

759
01:32:53,151 --> 01:32:54,360
Listen.

760
01:33:23,515 --> 01:33:25,683
Let me guess. Necros.

761
01:33:26,226 --> 01:33:29,019
And a whole lot
of Necro firepower.

762
01:33:29,521 --> 01:33:32,356
Shit! l hate not
being the bad guys.

763
01:34:00,885 --> 01:34:02,469
l figure
we got three minutes,

764
01:34:02,554 --> 01:34:05,597
before the sun hits us again,
burns out this whole valley.

765
01:34:05,682 --> 01:34:06,974
Wait.

766
01:34:07,058 --> 01:34:09,059
We gonna do this or not?

767
01:34:09,436 --> 01:34:10,811
Just wait.

768
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,067
Ellen.

769
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:21,363
Her name was Ellen.
l never really forgot.

770
01:34:41,176 --> 01:34:42,343
Boss!

771
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:55,689
Remember that
favorite game of yours?

772
01:34:55,774 --> 01:34:57,733
"Who's The Better Killer?"

773
01:34:59,444 --> 01:35:00,778
Let's play.

774
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:03,781
KYRA: Come on !

775
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,425
GUV: On the right!

776
01:35:31,309 --> 01:35:33,018
GUV: Watch out!
SYBAR: Behind you !

777
01:36:30,952 --> 01:36:32,244
Sybar!

778
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:53,056
No!

779
01:37:34,557 --> 01:37:35,891
KYRA: No!

780
01:38:18,393 --> 01:38:20,143
KYRA: Get up.

781
01:38:21,437 --> 01:38:22,813
Please get up.

782
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:40,747
So, you can kneel.

783
01:38:59,517 --> 01:39:01,184
SHlRAH:
l think you know now.

784
01:39:03,563 --> 01:39:06,315
l think you know
who tore Furya apart.

785
01:39:09,360 --> 01:39:12,904
This mark carries the
anger of an entire race.

786
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:20,245
But it's going to hurt.

787
01:41:39,010 --> 01:41:40,093
Kyra?

788
01:41:44,474 --> 01:41:47,017
PURlFlER: l was supposed
to deliver a message to you

789
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:51,438
if Vaako failed to kill you.

790
01:41:53,524 --> 01:41:56,276
A message from
the Lord Marshal himself.

791
01:41:58,112 --> 01:42:00,322
He tells you to
stay away from Helion.

792
01:42:00,406 --> 01:42:02,157
Stay away from him.

793
01:42:02,950 --> 01:42:05,702
And in return,
you'll be hunted no more.

794
01:42:12,251 --> 01:42:15,378
But Vaako will most likely
report you as dead.

795
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:18,340
So this is your chance.

796
01:42:19,717 --> 01:42:22,719
Your chance to do
what no man has ever done.

797
01:42:23,846 --> 01:42:25,180
The girl.

798
01:42:25,264 --> 01:42:27,098
Where will they take her?

799
01:42:44,575 --> 01:42:47,911
We all began
as something else.

800
01:42:52,083 --> 01:42:56,419
l've done
unbelievable things

801
01:42:57,547 --> 01:43:00,465
in the name of a faith
that was never my own.

802
01:43:02,426 --> 01:43:05,679
And he'll do to her
what he did to me.

803
01:43:12,562 --> 01:43:16,439
The Necromonger in me
warns you not to go back.

804
01:43:18,568 --> 01:43:20,443
But the Furyan in me

805
01:43:24,949 --> 01:43:26,908
hopes you won't listen.

806
01:43:32,623 --> 01:43:36,042
God knows
l've dreamed of it.

807
01:44:39,357 --> 01:44:41,691
MARSHAL: l have lost
a Purifier,

808
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:46,529
but l have gained
a First among commanders.

809
01:44:48,282 --> 01:44:50,241
lt is overdue, isn't it,

810
01:44:50,993 --> 01:44:53,954
that we acknowledge
your many accomplishments,

811
01:44:54,622 --> 01:44:56,373
your steady faith,

812
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:58,416
and above all,

813
01:44:58,834 --> 01:45:01,127
your unflinching loyalty?

814
01:45:09,470 --> 01:45:13,056
Obedience without question.
Loyalty till UnderVerse come.

815
01:45:15,226 --> 01:45:16,851
Well done, Vaako.

816
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:22,148
This is a day of days.

817
01:45:41,919 --> 01:45:44,004
Look more pleased, Vaako.

818
01:45:46,090 --> 01:45:48,967
You have killed his enemy

819
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,177
and his suspicions.

820
01:45:51,262 --> 01:45:52,887
l should have brought back
his head.

821
01:45:52,972 --> 01:45:56,141
You saw him unbreathing.
You saw him dead
on the ground.

822
01:45:56,225 --> 01:45:57,851
Riddick was
no common breeder.

823
01:45:57,935 --> 01:45:59,519
ln a heartbeat
he dropped 20 of my men.

824
01:45:59,603 --> 01:46:02,814
All mysteries
are not miracles,
not even in this religion.

825
01:46:05,776 --> 01:46:08,528
And if you say it is certain,
then it is certain.

826
01:46:09,321 --> 01:46:11,865
And we've already said it,
haven't we?

827
01:46:14,368 --> 01:46:15,785
We have.

828
01:46:20,583 --> 01:46:22,709
MARSHAL: Now,
tell me if it's true.

829
01:46:22,793 --> 01:46:24,377
Tell me the Furyan
is gone

830
01:46:24,462 --> 01:46:28,131
and l can close this campaign
without hearing his bootsteps.

831
01:46:28,674 --> 01:46:30,300
lf he is dead,

832
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:34,512
l sense l'm not
far from the same fate,

833
01:46:35,097 --> 01:46:37,307
being of no further use here.

834
01:46:37,725 --> 01:46:40,685
Shouldn't l tell you
that Riddick is still alive?

835
01:46:40,770 --> 01:46:42,645
Don't try me, Aereon.

836
01:46:42,730 --> 01:46:45,440
l could plough you under
with the rest of Helion Prime.

837
01:46:45,524 --> 01:46:47,150
No one really
knows the future.

838
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:51,321
Then tell me the odds.
That Vaako met with success.

839
01:46:51,822 --> 01:46:54,407
That l will
now be the one who
can carry his people

840
01:46:54,492 --> 01:46:56,618
across the threshold
into UnderVerse

841
01:46:56,702 --> 01:46:58,411
where they shall
begin true life.

842
01:46:58,496 --> 01:47:00,497
Tell me what l want to hear,
Aereon.

843
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:03,875
And maybe
l'll save your home world

844
01:47:04,460 --> 01:47:05,752
for last.

845
01:47:10,216 --> 01:47:11,382
The odds are good.

846
01:47:11,467 --> 01:47:12,509
That?

847
01:47:12,968 --> 01:47:15,512
That you will reach
the UnderVerse

848
01:47:18,140 --> 01:47:19,224
soon.

849
01:47:58,848 --> 01:48:00,473
Ascension protocol !

850
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:02,767
We still have numbers
out there, Lord Marshal.

851
01:48:02,852 --> 01:48:04,310
Sweep teams,
recon ships.

852
01:48:04,395 --> 01:48:06,688
They would be hard-pressed
to make it back. . .

853
01:48:11,235 --> 01:48:14,237
Get my armada off the ground.

854
01:49:17,134 --> 01:49:20,261
You mean on Helion?
l mean here on this very ship.

855
01:49:20,346 --> 01:49:22,138
Could you be wrong?

856
01:49:22,806 --> 01:49:25,642
Mind fabricates fear.
Could you be wrong?

857
01:49:25,726 --> 01:49:28,311
Not so wrong as you
when you left him alive!

858
01:49:28,979 --> 01:49:30,688
lt's twice a mistake.

859
01:49:30,773 --> 01:49:34,067
Not only your failure,
but now the report of success.

860
01:49:34,151 --> 01:49:36,653
How do we salvage this? How?

861
01:49:38,155 --> 01:49:40,490
Lord Marshal's
got to be warned.

862
01:49:40,866 --> 01:49:43,326
You will never
see the UnderVerse!

863
01:49:43,786 --> 01:49:46,579
He will kill us both
before our due time.

864
01:49:49,291 --> 01:49:51,084
l say give Riddick his chance.

865
01:49:55,798 --> 01:49:58,174
lf he is half
of what you think,

866
01:49:58,425 --> 01:50:00,176
he can at least wound
the Lord Marshal.

867
01:50:00,261 --> 01:50:03,263
And that is when you must act.

868
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:05,640
Just to take his place?
Just to keep what l kill?

869
01:50:05,724 --> 01:50:07,308
That is the Necromonger way.

870
01:50:07,393 --> 01:50:10,561
lt is not enough !
Then you do it for the faith !

871
01:50:11,021 --> 01:50:13,856
lf he has fear,
he has weakness.

872
01:50:14,233 --> 01:50:16,442
lf he has weakness,
Vaako. . .

873
01:50:17,778 --> 01:50:19,946
He is unworthy of Lordship.

874
01:50:21,198 --> 01:50:23,408
We do it for all Necromongers.

875
01:50:25,286 --> 01:50:26,995
Protect the faith.

876
01:50:27,371 --> 01:50:29,706
This can still
be a day of days.

877
01:50:30,541 --> 01:50:33,251
But the timing must

878
01:50:34,253 --> 01:50:35,670
be flawless.

879
01:50:57,443 --> 01:51:00,653
Final protocol.
Execute on my order.

880
01:51:36,357 --> 01:51:37,815
Go inside.

881
01:51:40,027 --> 01:51:41,319
Are they leaving now?

882
01:51:41,403 --> 01:51:43,696
Ziza, go inside.

883
01:52:36,166 --> 01:52:38,251
OFFlCER: We found
this Lensor dead.

884
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:42,797
MARSHAL: Show me
his last sight.

885
01:52:56,395 --> 01:52:58,062
Commander Toal.

886
01:52:58,147 --> 01:52:59,981
He won't escape twice.

887
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,430
Stay your weapons.

888
01:54:57,307 --> 01:54:58,933
He came for me.

889
01:55:25,961 --> 01:55:27,503
MARSHAL: Consider this.

890
01:55:33,844 --> 01:55:36,762
lf you fall here now,

891
01:55:37,389 --> 01:55:39,056
you'll never rise.

892
01:55:40,309 --> 01:55:42,685
But if you choose
another way,

893
01:55:43,520 --> 01:55:45,396
the Necromonger way,

894
01:55:46,356 --> 01:55:48,983
you'll die in due time

895
01:55:49,067 --> 01:55:51,694
and rise again
in the UnderVerse.

896
01:56:01,913 --> 01:56:03,164
Go to him.

897
01:56:12,299 --> 01:56:13,758
lt hurts

898
01:56:14,468 --> 01:56:15,843
at first.

899
01:56:17,179 --> 01:56:21,015
But after a while,
the pain goes away,
just as they promise.

900
01:56:22,976 --> 01:56:24,727
Are you with me, Kyra?

901
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:29,065
There's a moment when you
can almost see the UnderVerse
through his eyes.

902
01:56:29,566 --> 01:56:31,567
He makes it sound perfect.

903
01:56:32,194 --> 01:56:34,070
A place where
anyone can start over.

904
01:56:34,154 --> 01:56:36,906
Are you with me, Kyra?

905
01:56:49,336 --> 01:56:51,087
Convert now

906
01:56:51,630 --> 01:56:53,464
or fall forever.

907
01:56:58,762 --> 01:57:00,930
You killed everything l know.

908
01:57:06,645 --> 01:57:07,812
Vaako.

909
01:57:10,148 --> 01:57:11,524
Not yet.

910
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:26,330
Been a long time
since l've seen
my own blood.

911
01:58:44,534 --> 01:58:46,827
MARSHAL: These are his last
moments.

912
01:59:06,932 --> 01:59:09,308
MARSHAL: Give me your soul.

913
01:59:14,564 --> 01:59:15,981
RlDDlCK: Fuck you !

914
02:00:23,550 --> 02:00:26,093
You are not the one
to bring me down.

915
02:00:44,988 --> 02:00:47,656
Now! Kill the beast
while he's wounded !

916
02:01:04,883 --> 02:01:06,467
Help me, Vaako.

917
02:01:07,344 --> 02:01:08,636
Kill him.

918
02:01:16,186 --> 02:01:17,394
Vaako?

919
02:01:22,150 --> 02:01:23,609
Forgive me.

920
02:01:24,402 --> 02:01:25,694
Flawless.

921
02:01:58,311 --> 02:01:59,395
No.

922
02:02:05,235 --> 02:02:06,360
No!

923
02:02:08,279 --> 02:02:10,781
Now, what would be the odds
of that?

924
02:02:24,879 --> 02:02:26,839
l thought you were dead.

925
02:02:29,592 --> 02:02:31,427
Are you with me, Kyra?

926
02:02:34,723 --> 02:02:36,598
l was always with you.

927
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,310
l was.

928
02:04:04,437 --> 02:04:06,355
You keep what you kill.

928
02:04:07,305 --> 02:05:07,194
