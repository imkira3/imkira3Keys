1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:54,947
Bingo!

3
00:02:09,253 --> 00:02:11,130
Fucking hell.

4
00:02:13,382 --> 00:02:15,343
Fucking hell.

5
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,145
- Oh, God...
- Keep your shit together.

6
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:11,315
If you wanna get 'em out of here.

7
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:14,819
- I can pop these, no problem.
- So get to it!

8
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,544
Security, we have a break-in. Get the...

9
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,847
I know who you are.
I know what you think...

10
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,767
If you don't wanna get hurt,
keep your mouth shut and don't move.

11
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:52,106
The chimps are infected. They're highly
contagious. They've been given an inhibitor.

12
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,651
- Infected with what?
- To cure, you must first understand.

13
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,696
Infected with what?

14
00:04:00,656 --> 00:04:02,533
Rage.

15
00:04:04,243 --> 00:04:07,413
- What is he talking about?
- Get the cages open.

16
00:04:07,496 --> 00:04:08,831
No! No! No!

17
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,836
Listen, you sick bastard,
we're taking your torture victims with us.

18
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,505
We'll get you out of here.

19
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:20,259
The animals are contagious. The infection
is in their blood and saliva. One bite...

20
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,845
Stop... Stop! You've no idea!

21
00:04:29,393 --> 00:04:32,230
Get it off! Help me!

22
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,737
Get it off! Get it off!

23
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,577
- What's the matter with her?
- You have to kill her!

24
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,915
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

25
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:58,464
- What's the matter with her?
- We have to kill her now!

26
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,552
Oh, God...

27
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,037
Hello?

28
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:32,994
Hello?

29
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:53,139
<i>Hello!</i>

30
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,409
Hello?

31
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,228
Hello!

32
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,648
Hello?

33
00:15:06,656 --> 00:15:08,741
Hello?

34
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:25,174
Father?

35
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,683
Father, are you OK?

36
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,693
Oh, shouldn't have done that.

37
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,362
Shouldn't have done that.

38
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,656
Shit!

39
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,560
<i>Over here!</i>

40
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,773
- Over here!
- Come on!

41
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,705
Go, go, go!

42
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,045
Keep going!

43
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:47,006
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just shut up!

44
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,725
- Covered everything.
- Who are those people?

45
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,295
Let's go! Let's go!

46
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,631
- What the fuck is going on?
- Just move!

47
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,433
Come on!

48
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:03,374
Man walks into a bar with a giraffe.
They each get pissed.

49
00:18:03,457 --> 00:18:05,459
The giraffe falls over.

50
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:10,756
The man goes to leave and the barman says
"Oi! You can't leave that lying there. "

51
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,886
He says "No, it's not a lion. It's a giraffe".

52
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:25,396
He's completely humourless.

53
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,399
You two should get on like a house on fire.

54
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,986
So who are you?

55
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,114
You're from the hospital.

56
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:38,701
- Are you a doctor?
- He's not a doctor. He's a patient.

57
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,120
I'm a bicycle courier.

58
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:49,712
I was riding a package from Farringdon to
Shaftesbury Avenue and a car cut across me.

59
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,549
Then I wake up today in hospital.
I wake up and I'm...

60
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,551
I'm hallucinating or I'm...

61
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,680
What's your name?

62
00:18:59,764 --> 00:19:01,849
Jim.

63
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:05,186
I'm Mark. This is Selena.

64
00:19:09,607 --> 00:19:11,275
OK, Jim.

65
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,033
I've got some bad news.

66
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:25,373
It started as rioting, and right from
the beginning you knew this was different.

67
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:29,627
Because it was happening
in small villages, market towns.

68
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:33,256
And then it wasn't on the TV any more.

69
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:38,052
It was in the street outside.
It was coming through your windows.

70
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,971
It was a virus.

71
00:19:40,054 --> 00:19:41,848
An infection.

72
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,767
You didn't need a doctor to tell you that.

73
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,311
It was the blood.

74
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,897
There was something in the blood.

75
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:56,320
By the time they tried to evacuate
the cities, it was already too late.

76
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:59,323
The infection was everywhere.

77
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,909
The army blockades were overrun.

78
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,164
And that's when the exodus started.

79
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:10,293
The day before broadcasting stopped,

80
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:14,046
there were reports of Infection
in Paris and New York.

81
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,343
We didn't hear anything more after that.

82
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,266
- What's the government doing?
- There's no government.

83
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,810
Of course there's a government!

84
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:31,981
There's always a government.
They're in a bunker or a plane...

85
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:36,360
No, there's no government,
no police, no army.

86
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:40,907
No TV, no radio, no electricity.

87
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:45,703
You're the first uninfected person
we've seen in six days.

88
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:48,623
Where's your family?

89
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,584
They're dead. Like Selena's.

90
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,794
Yours will be dead too.

91
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,100
Look, I have to find them.
They live in Deptford. I can walk it. OK?

92
00:21:08,184 --> 00:21:10,770
You'll go and come back, yeah?

93
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:14,982
- You won't.
- Yes!

94
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,069
No one ever comes back.

95
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,659
So lesson one.

96
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:29,956
You never go anywhere alone
unless you've got no choice.

97
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:32,375
Lesson two.

98
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,546
Only travel during daylight.
Unless you've got no choice.

99
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:40,633
We'll take you tomorrow.

100
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,303
We'll all go and find
your dead parents together, OK?

101
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:46,806
Eat.

102
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:02,154
If you want her to slow down,
you'll have to say.

103
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,725
- If there's anyone...
- I understand.

104
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,894
- Anyone...
- I understand!

105
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:36,564
OK.

106
00:23:18,356 --> 00:23:19,690
Jim...

107
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,859
Wait!

108
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,489
They died peacefully.
You should be grateful.

109
00:24:50,573 --> 00:24:52,992
I'm not grateful.

110
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:56,245
My...

111
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:01,459
parents and my sister,
we went to Paddington Station,

112
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:09,425
hoping maybe we could get on a plane,
maybe we could buy our way onto a plane.

113
00:25:10,051 --> 00:25:12,428
I remember my dad had all this cash,

114
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,848
even though cash was completely useless.

115
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:20,520
About 20,000 other people had the same idea.

116
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,233
Crowd was surging.

117
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:28,402
I lost my grip on my sister's hand.

118
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:32,907
I remember the ground was soft.

119
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:39,247
I looked down
and I was standing on all these people.

120
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,292
Like a carpet. People who had fallen and...

121
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:47,338
Somewhere in the crowd
there were Infected. It spread fast.

122
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:50,758
No one could run.
All you could do was climb.

123
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:55,471
Climb over more people.
So I did that. I climbed.

124
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,932
And I got up on top of this kiosk.

125
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:05,189
Looking down, you couldn't tell
which faces were infected and which weren't.

126
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:09,151
Then I saw my dad.
Not my mum or my sister.

127
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,195
My dad.

128
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,575
His face...

129
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:23,166
Selena's right.
You should be grateful.

130
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:28,421
We don't have time to get back to the shop
before dark. We should stay here tonight.

131
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:33,926
My room's up at the top.
You two can have that.

132
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:37,346
No, we'll all sleep in the same room. It's safer.

133
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,720
<i>Jim.</i>

134
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:10,481
<i>- You're back.
- Yeah.</i>

135
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:18,948
<i>- How was it?
- Fine.</i>

136
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,326
<i>Give me a drink of that, will ya?</i>

137
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,495
<i>- It's empty.
- Ha!</i>

138
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:29,125
<i>Here.</i>

139
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,296
<i>I'll start working on them, then.</i>

140
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:41,929
Mark! Mark!

141
00:28:42,722 --> 00:28:44,849
Selena! Help!

142
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,282
<i>It's clear.</i>

143
00:29:06,746 --> 00:29:09,707
- That's Mr Bridges.
- Were you bitten?

144
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,001
And his daughter. From four doors down.

145
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:15,171
- Were you bitten?
- No.

146
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:18,174
Did any of the blood get in your mouth?

147
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,093
No.

148
00:29:24,222 --> 00:29:25,973
Mark?

149
00:29:28,392 --> 00:29:30,102
Wait...

150
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:54,168
Get that cleaned off.

151
00:29:56,045 --> 00:29:58,130
Do you have any clothes here?

152
00:29:59,257 --> 00:30:01,133
Um... I... Yes.

153
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:04,887
Then get them and get dressed.
We have to leave now.

154
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:08,641
More Infected will be coming.
They always do.

155
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,423
<i>How did you know?
How did you know he was infected?</i>

156
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:44,427
- The blood.
- There was blood on me. It was on you.

157
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,891
I didn't know he was infected.
He knew. I could see it in his face.

158
00:30:49,974 --> 00:30:54,395
If someone gets infected,
you've about 20 seconds to kill them.

159
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:59,609
It might be your brother, your sister
or your oldest friend. It makes no difference.

160
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:05,114
Just so you know where you stand,
if it happens to you, I'll do it in a heartbeat.

161
00:31:05,198 --> 00:31:09,410
He was full of plans.
Have you got any plans, Jim?

162
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:13,956
Do you want us to find a cure and
save the world orjust fall in love and fuck?

163
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,542
Plans are pointless.

164
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,212
Staying alive's as good as it gets.

165
00:31:21,047 --> 00:31:22,465
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

166
00:31:22,548 --> 00:31:24,634
What's that?

167
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,808
Let's go.

168
00:32:17,937 --> 00:32:21,065
What is it about tower blocks
and shopping trolleys?

169
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:24,235
Stop talking. It's a long way up.

170
00:32:33,953 --> 00:32:36,289
<i>Do you need a break?</i>

171
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,500
- You?
- No.

172
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:44,255
Now I do need a break.

173
00:32:54,724 --> 00:32:56,559
What's up?

174
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:58,644
Nothin'.

175
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,356
I got a headache.

176
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,941
- Bad?
- Pretty bad.

177
00:33:04,025 --> 00:33:09,322
- Why didn't you say something before?
- I didn't think you'd give a shit.

178
00:33:10,531 --> 00:33:14,785
You've got no fat on you
and all you've had to eat is sugar.

179
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:16,996
So you're crashing.

180
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,332
There isn't a lot we can do about that

181
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:24,504
except pump you full of painkillers
and give you more sugar. As for sugar,

182
00:33:24,587 --> 00:33:26,881
Pepsi or Lilt?

183
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,134
Do you have any Tango?

184
00:33:30,218 --> 00:33:33,262
Actually,
I did have a can of Tango somewhere.

185
00:33:34,472 --> 00:33:36,724
Quiet! That's an Infected.

186
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:48,903
Oh no, they're in. Move!

187
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,534
Wait up, Selena!

188
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,453
Wait for me, please!

189
00:33:57,537 --> 00:33:59,664
Please, Selena! Please!

190
00:33:59,747 --> 00:34:02,083
- Wait for me!
- Come on!

191
00:34:02,166 --> 00:34:04,168
- Run!
- Wait!

192
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:07,505
Please! For fuck's sake!

193
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:10,341
<i>Selena!</i>

194
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:15,429
Down the corridor. Flat 157. Move!

195
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,598
Thank you. Thank you.

196
00:34:30,069 --> 00:34:32,113
Open the door!

197
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,287
Open the door!

198
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,502
- Open up!
- Where's Dad?

199
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:48,045
What?

200
00:34:50,631 --> 00:34:53,634
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Dad?

201
00:34:53,718 --> 00:34:56,012
Let them in, Hannah. Let them inside.

202
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,230
Go in. Go in!

203
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:26,709
So, I'm Frank, anyway.

204
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:28,586
Jim.

205
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,507
- Selena.
- Selena. Good to meet you.

206
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,884
This is my daughter Hannah.

207
00:35:34,967 --> 00:35:37,220
Come on, sweetheart. Say hello.

208
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:40,723
Come on.

209
00:35:41,474 --> 00:35:43,434
So...

210
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:45,436
This is great. Just great.

211
00:35:47,772 --> 00:35:50,066
Calls for a celebration, I'd say.

212
00:35:50,149 --> 00:35:53,194
Why don't you all sit down and...

213
00:35:53,277 --> 00:35:56,239
Hannah, what have we got to offer?

214
00:35:56,322 --> 00:35:58,825
We've got Mum's crème de menthe.

215
00:35:58,908 --> 00:36:01,619
Great. Crème de menthe.

216
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:04,413
Oh, yeah. Look, sit, please.

217
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:06,958
Get comfortable.

218
00:36:09,794 --> 00:36:12,797
<i>- Where are the bloody glasses?
- Middle cupboard.</i>

219
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,758
Nah, the good ones. It's a celebration.

220
00:36:15,842 --> 00:36:18,344
Top cupboard.

221
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,138
So this is your place?

222
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,141
It's nice.

223
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,447
There.

224
00:36:38,531 --> 00:36:41,617
I know it isn't much but, well, cheers.

225
00:36:41,701 --> 00:36:43,452
Cheers.

226
00:37:04,974 --> 00:37:07,059
You OK in there, Jim?

227
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:10,354
Yeah.

228
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:16,027
Sorry we couldn't spare the water.
Same with the toilet. The flush doesn't work.

229
00:37:17,695 --> 00:37:19,947
You'll have to use the bucket.

230
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:29,123
Have to empty it each morning.

231
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,877
Just chuck it over the balcony.
No mod cons here.

232
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,670
It's fine.

233
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:37,882
Listen, it's late. We're gonna turn in.

234
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:41,928
We have a spare room.

235
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,263
In there.

236
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:46,307
Are you and Selena...?

237
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:49,393
No. No, no, no.

238
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,145
Um...

239
00:37:51,229 --> 00:37:53,606
I'll take the living room. It's fine.

240
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,566
Right.

241
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:58,528
No, I mean, yeah.

242
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,572
So, um...

243
00:38:02,615 --> 00:38:05,618
- Goodnight, then.
- Yeah. Goodnight, Frank.

244
00:38:20,258 --> 00:38:21,801
Very spruce.

245
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:25,972
- Very shredded.
- Yeah.

246
00:38:30,309 --> 00:38:34,021
- So what do you make of them?
- Well, they're desperate.

247
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:37,984
Probably need us more than we need them.

248
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,696
I think they're good people.

249
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:47,493
- Good people?
- Yeah.

250
00:38:49,287 --> 00:38:53,958
You should be more concerned about
whether they're gonna slow you down.

251
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:57,795
- Because if they slowed you down...
- I'd leave them behind.

252
00:38:57,879 --> 00:38:59,797
- In a heartbeat.
- Yeah.

253
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:02,175
I wouldn't.

254
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:05,803
Then you're gonna wind up
getting yourself killed.

255
00:39:14,145 --> 00:39:16,647
I'm gonna get some sleep.

256
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:21,027
Selena...

257
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:25,114
You think I don't get it, but I do get it.

258
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:30,995
And I know I'd be dead already
if I hadn't met you.

259
00:39:31,496 --> 00:39:33,080
Sure.

260
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:34,749
No, look...

261
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,212
I mean, thank you.

262
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,550
And I mean, sure.

263
00:39:44,634 --> 00:39:47,428
Goodnight, Jim.

264
00:39:47,512 --> 00:39:49,597
Goodnight.

265
00:40:03,194 --> 00:40:05,279
We lost water pressure three weeks ago.

266
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:09,492
I thought we'd be OK with the water
from the other flats. Cisterns and tanks.

267
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:12,787
But it vanishes so quick
you wouldn't believe.

268
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:17,792
You drink it,

269
00:40:17,875 --> 00:40:19,669
it evaporates,

270
00:40:19,752 --> 00:40:21,838
turns stagnant.

271
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:26,300
They're all empty.

272
00:40:27,176 --> 00:40:29,178
Hasn't rained in ten days.

273
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:33,516
You can set up a plastic sheet
to catch dew and condensation.

274
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:37,353
Saw it on TV once, but I can't make it work.

275
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:40,773
You'd never think it.

276
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,652
Needing rain so badly.

277
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,739
Not in fucking England!

278
00:40:53,411 --> 00:40:56,539
Jim, we're not going to be able to stay here.

279
00:41:05,464 --> 00:41:09,218
- There's been no broadcasts for weeks.
- Just listen.

280
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:13,890
<i>Salvation is here.
The answer to Infection is here.</i>

281
00:41:13,973 --> 00:41:16,976
<i>If you can hear this, you're not alone.</i>

282
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:21,564
<i>There are others like you.
There are other survivors.</i>

283
00:41:21,647 --> 00:41:23,858
<i>We are soldiers and we are armed.</i>

284
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:27,236
Oh, my God. Soldiers.

285
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,908
<i>- Quiet. There's more.
- Our location is the 42nd blockade, M602,</i>

286
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,411
<i>27 miles northeast of Manchester.</i>

287
00:41:35,495 --> 00:41:39,415
<i>- You must find us. Salvation is...
- Now it just repeats.</i>

288
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,876
- It's a recording?
- Yeah, it's a recording.

289
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,879
But this is where it's telling us to go.

290
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:47,131
Just there.

291
00:41:48,633 --> 00:41:53,429
The way things are, we might need
two or three days to get up there.

292
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:55,223
"We"?

293
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:05,399
<i>Sound carries in this flat. Me and Hannah
do need you more than you need us.</i>

294
00:42:05,483 --> 00:42:08,653
- Look, I didn't...
- No, it's OK. It's the truth.

295
00:42:08,736 --> 00:42:11,239
I can't leave the block if it's the two of us.

296
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:15,284
Something might happen to me.
Hannah'd be alone. I couldn't risk it.

297
00:42:15,368 --> 00:42:17,078
But with other people...

298
00:42:17,161 --> 00:42:21,457
If it's a recording,
the soldiers who made it could be dead.

299
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:25,044
- It's possible.
- That stuff about the answer to Infection...

300
00:42:25,127 --> 00:42:29,423
There is no answer!
It's already done all the damage it can!

301
00:42:29,507 --> 00:42:32,343
- Maybe they have a cure.
- Maybe they've got nothing.

302
00:42:32,426 --> 00:42:36,514
- The only way to find out is to reach them.
- We could die trying, Frank!

303
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,893
Or die here.

304
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:46,691
And anyway, it isn't true what Dad said.
You need us just the same as we need you.

305
00:42:48,192 --> 00:42:50,069
We need each other.

306
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:55,449
And we'll never be safe in the cities.
The soldiers could keep us safe.

307
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:58,244
So we have to try and get there.

308
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,955
Get there how?

309
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:16,137
Just so you know,
I don't take cheques or credit cards.

310
00:43:44,707 --> 00:43:47,710
<i>- What do you think?
- It's the most direct route.</i>

311
00:43:47,793 --> 00:43:53,049
Then we should take the indirect route.
The one in daylight and not underground.

312
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:55,468
<i>Let's just get it done.</i>

313
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:10,566
<i>No, no.</i>

314
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:13,152
No. See, this is a really shit idea.

315
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:17,406
<i>You know why?
Because it's obviously a shit idea.</i>

316
00:44:17,490 --> 00:44:21,869
So we're gonna drive into the tunnel
full of fucking smashed cars...

317
00:44:21,953 --> 00:44:24,872
It's really fucking obviously a shit idea!

318
00:44:24,956 --> 00:44:27,208
Hold on!

319
00:44:36,384 --> 00:44:38,261
Dad!

320
00:44:57,697 --> 00:44:59,240
Fuck!

321
00:45:00,533 --> 00:45:02,952
The world's worst place to get a flat.

322
00:45:03,035 --> 00:45:06,372
Agreed. I think we'd better do this quick.

323
00:45:08,875 --> 00:45:11,043
I've got the wheel. You're on the jack.

324
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:29,187
Do you hear that?
Hey, hey, do you hear that?

325
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:31,355
Hear what?

326
00:45:32,023 --> 00:45:34,317
<i>Right, I've done it.</i>

327
00:45:35,902 --> 00:45:37,361
Dad?

328
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:44,327
<i>Jesus Christ!</i>

329
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:45,953
Fucking rats!

330
00:45:56,506 --> 00:45:59,091
They're running from the Infected.

331
00:45:59,175 --> 00:46:01,093
Move it!

332
00:46:01,177 --> 00:46:05,473
Forget the jack, Hannah.
There's no time. Just lift, everyone.

333
00:46:05,556 --> 00:46:08,809
Grab hold! One, two, three, lift!

334
00:46:12,772 --> 00:46:14,732
Lift, lift!

335
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:20,404
<i>- Don't look at them! Don't look!
- I can see them! They're coming!</i>

336
00:46:26,118 --> 00:46:28,704
Come on, Hannah!

337
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:31,207
Almost.

338
00:46:31,290 --> 00:46:34,210
- Get the tyre on, Hannah!
- I'm trying.

339
00:46:39,006 --> 00:46:41,676
Three, two, one,

340
00:46:41,759 --> 00:46:43,469
drop it!

341
00:46:47,598 --> 00:46:50,059
- Get in the car!
- Come on!

342
00:46:52,144 --> 00:46:54,522
- Frank, drive!
- Move it, Frank!

343
00:46:57,441 --> 00:46:59,527
<i>Whoo!</i>

344
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:06,409
Goodbye, you fuckers!

345
00:47:14,375 --> 00:47:16,669
Frank, stop the cab.

346
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:41,944
Let's shop.

347
00:47:52,580 --> 00:47:54,081
You...

348
00:47:54,874 --> 00:47:56,375
You...

349
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,294
You...

350
00:47:58,377 --> 00:48:00,963
<i>Anybody seen any buns?</i>

351
00:48:01,047 --> 00:48:03,841
Hmm. Irradiated.

352
00:48:06,552 --> 00:48:10,139
Don't take anything
that needs to be cooked, OK?

353
00:48:10,223 --> 00:48:12,058
I think you can eat that raw.

354
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:14,018
Decaffeinated coffee...

355
00:48:14,101 --> 00:48:16,187
Put that back.

356
00:48:17,396 --> 00:48:19,649
Can't just take any crap.

357
00:48:19,732 --> 00:48:24,237
If I never see another chocolate bar again,
it'll be too soon.

358
00:48:24,654 --> 00:48:27,323
Not counting Terry's Chocolate Orange!

359
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,578
Now, single malt,
16-year-old, dark, full flavour.

360
00:48:33,538 --> 00:48:35,498
Warm but not aggressive.

361
00:48:35,581 --> 00:48:39,085
<i>Peaty aftertaste.</i>

362
00:48:40,670 --> 00:48:43,923
Takes out the fire but leaves in the warmth.

363
00:49:38,811 --> 00:49:41,898
Either we do this now or we're walking.

364
00:49:48,905 --> 00:49:50,990
Not you.

365
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:56,621
- Stay close, Jim.
- What?

366
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,789
You heard.

367
00:50:25,358 --> 00:50:27,443
Where are you going?

368
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:30,947
We've got enough food, Jim.

369
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:33,366
We don't have any cheeseburgers.

370
00:50:34,116 --> 00:50:36,786
<i>Like going on holidays
with your aunt!</i>

371
00:51:15,992 --> 00:51:18,452
Oh, Jesus.

372
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,813
Hello?

373
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:01,412
I hate you!

374
00:52:10,588 --> 00:52:12,673
Find anything?

375
00:52:14,926 --> 00:52:17,720
- Find anything, Jim?
- No! Let's get outta here.

376
00:52:17,803 --> 00:52:19,889
OK, we're done here.

377
00:52:22,099 --> 00:52:23,976
OK, Hannah.

378
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,027
Easy. Brake!

379
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:35,196
Brake, brake!

380
00:52:43,037 --> 00:52:45,122
Out.

381
00:53:29,709 --> 00:53:32,920
<i>Mmmm! Oh my God!</i>

382
00:53:33,671 --> 00:53:36,674
I can, like, taste the vitamin C.

383
00:53:37,508 --> 00:53:40,303
Mmmm, the raisins are so moist.

384
00:53:41,512 --> 00:53:43,598
What did you say?

385
00:53:43,681 --> 00:53:46,475
The raisins. They're so moist.

386
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:53,316
Look over here.

387
00:54:04,619 --> 00:54:06,454
Like a family.

388
00:54:06,537 --> 00:54:08,998
<i>Do you think they're infected?</i>

389
00:54:09,415 --> 00:54:11,501
<i>No.</i>

390
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:17,673
They're doing just fine.

391
00:54:23,429 --> 00:54:25,515
Come on. Let's eat!

392
00:54:40,196 --> 00:54:41,531
Know what I was thinking?

393
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:45,326
That you'll never hear
another piece of original music again.

394
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:49,580
You'll never read a book
that hasn't already been written,

395
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,460
or see a film that hasn't already been shot.

396
00:54:58,965 --> 00:55:02,218
<i>Um... that's what you were thinking.</i>

397
00:55:02,301 --> 00:55:04,178
No.

398
00:55:05,429 --> 00:55:07,723
I was thinking I was wrong.

399
00:55:08,975 --> 00:55:11,060
About what?

400
00:55:12,770 --> 00:55:14,856
All the death.

401
00:55:15,439 --> 00:55:17,525
All this shit.

402
00:55:19,152 --> 00:55:23,656
It doesn't really mean anything
to Frank and Hannah because...

403
00:55:25,032 --> 00:55:28,494
Well, she's got her dad
and he's got his daughter. So...

404
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:30,705
Cheeky monkey!

405
00:55:31,164 --> 00:55:34,792
I was wrong when I said
staying alive is as good as it gets.

406
00:55:38,421 --> 00:55:40,923
<i>See, that's what I was thinking.</i>

407
00:55:41,424 --> 00:55:43,092
Was it?

408
00:55:43,176 --> 00:55:45,469
Mm. You stole my thought.

409
00:55:50,683 --> 00:55:52,560
Sorry.

410
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,396
That's OK.

411
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,565
You can keep it.

412
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:02,695
It's getting late.
We'd better stay here for the night.

413
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:20,296
I can't sleep.

414
00:56:20,379 --> 00:56:23,007
Me neither.

415
00:56:23,090 --> 00:56:25,468
Doesn't feel safe, does it?

416
00:56:25,551 --> 00:56:27,637
Outside like this.

417
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:30,932
I think we're safe enough.

418
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:33,684
Selena didn't seem to have any trouble.

419
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:36,896
Yeah, I noticed that.

420
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:38,481
Hey, Selena...

421
00:56:38,564 --> 00:56:40,650
What? What is it?

422
00:56:41,984 --> 00:56:44,028
How'd you get to sleep?

423
00:56:50,493 --> 00:56:54,372
Bloody hell. Must've needed
a hell of a prescription for that lot.

424
00:56:54,455 --> 00:56:58,751
I didn't need a prescription.
I qualified as a chemist.

425
00:56:58,835 --> 00:57:01,379
Oh, great. Valium.

426
00:57:01,462 --> 00:57:04,048
Not only will we be able to get to sleep

427
00:57:04,131 --> 00:57:07,844
but if we're attacked in the middle
of the night, we won't even care.

428
00:57:07,927 --> 00:57:10,179
- Two each.
- Not for me, thanks.

429
00:57:10,263 --> 00:57:12,306
Can I, Dad?

430
00:57:12,390 --> 00:57:14,392
I don't think so, sweetheart.

431
00:57:14,475 --> 00:57:15,977
Please?

432
00:57:17,478 --> 00:57:19,564
- No.
- I can't sleep.

433
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,361
Come on, Frank. Let her live a little.

434
00:57:26,445 --> 00:57:30,449
- Give her half of one.
- All right. We're on.

435
00:57:41,127 --> 00:57:43,087
Night-night.

436
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:46,507
You're a big softie, Frank.

437
00:58:17,121 --> 00:58:19,081
Frank?

438
00:58:19,165 --> 00:58:21,250
Hannah?

439
00:58:21,334 --> 00:58:23,211
Frank?

440
00:58:28,841 --> 00:58:30,927
Hello? Hello!

441
00:58:31,969 --> 00:58:33,221
Hello!

442
00:58:33,304 --> 00:58:35,806
Hello! Hello!

443
00:58:43,898 --> 00:58:45,983
Shh...

444
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,154
You're having a bad dream, that's all.

445
00:58:52,907 --> 00:58:54,992
Thanks, Dad.

446
00:59:30,278 --> 00:59:32,864
Come on, sleepyhead.

447
00:59:36,534 --> 00:59:38,619
Come on, Babe Ruth.

448
00:59:41,831 --> 00:59:43,708
<i>Hurry up.</i>

449
00:59:45,459 --> 00:59:48,963
<i>- Did I miss breakfast?
- You'll sleep through anything.</i>

450
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:54,051
<i>- Did you have a fry-up?
- We'll stop at a pub on the way. Door!</i>

451
01:00:18,618 --> 01:00:23,122
<i>Our location
is the 42nd blockade, the M602,</i>

452
01:00:23,206 --> 01:00:26,292
<i>27 miles northeast of Manchester.</i>

453
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:28,294
<i>You must find us. Please!</i>

454
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:30,505
<i>Salvation is here.</i>

455
01:00:30,588 --> 01:00:33,633
<i>The answer to Infection is here.</i>

456
01:01:05,665 --> 01:01:07,750
Must be Manchester.

457
01:01:09,961 --> 01:01:13,339
The whole of Manchester, the whole city.

458
01:01:15,174 --> 01:01:17,510
No fire crews to put it out.

459
01:02:12,315 --> 01:02:14,901
42nd blockade.

460
01:02:14,984 --> 01:02:17,320
This is it.

461
01:03:28,474 --> 01:03:32,478
I don't understand, Dad.
Did they leave?

462
01:03:32,562 --> 01:03:35,690
- I don't like this. I think we should go.
- No!

463
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:47,368
Vehicles. We should check the vehicles.
There has to be something.

464
01:04:05,511 --> 01:04:07,430
Nothing.

465
01:04:07,513 --> 01:04:09,432
I can't believe it.

466
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:11,476
Frank...

467
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:13,811
Frank!

468
01:04:16,022 --> 01:04:17,690
- We have to go.
- Yeah.

469
01:04:17,773 --> 01:04:20,276
Go fucking where?!

470
01:04:59,398 --> 01:05:01,567
Get out of it.

471
01:05:05,071 --> 01:05:07,156
Get out of it!

472
01:05:24,966 --> 01:05:27,552
Dad, are you all right?

473
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:30,304
Yeah, I'm fine, sweetheart.

474
01:05:31,222 --> 01:05:33,933
Sorry I lost my temper.

475
01:05:34,016 --> 01:05:36,144
Hannah...

476
01:05:36,227 --> 01:05:39,188
I love you very much.

477
01:05:39,272 --> 01:05:41,274
- What?
- Keep away from me.

478
01:05:41,357 --> 01:05:43,693
Stay where you are.

479
01:05:43,776 --> 01:05:46,696
- Dad?
- Keep away from me! Keep away from me!

480
01:05:46,779 --> 01:05:49,282
Keep away! Keep away! Keep away!

481
01:05:49,365 --> 01:05:52,493
- Dad!
- Keep away! Keep away!

482
01:05:53,995 --> 01:05:56,747
<i>What's wrong? Dad!</i>

483
01:06:01,043 --> 01:06:03,462
Jim! Jim, he's infected!

484
01:06:03,546 --> 01:06:06,174
- No!
- Now, Jim! Now!

485
01:06:06,257 --> 01:06:09,677
- Jim, kill him! Jim!
- Dad!

486
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:11,053
Kill him!

487
01:06:19,520 --> 01:06:21,814
Stay away from him!

488
01:06:23,065 --> 01:06:25,485
Keep away from the body!

489
01:06:28,237 --> 01:06:30,114
Dad?

490
01:06:52,512 --> 01:06:55,181
<i>Three survivors. One male, two female.</i>

491
01:06:55,264 --> 01:06:58,601
I repeat, one male, two female.

492
01:06:58,684 --> 01:07:01,270
ETA, 15.

493
01:07:01,354 --> 01:07:03,815
Put the kettle on.

494
01:07:51,779 --> 01:07:54,282
I'm Major Henry West.

495
01:07:55,533 --> 01:07:57,243
- Welcome.
- Jim.

496
01:07:57,326 --> 01:07:59,328
Hello, Jim.

497
01:07:59,412 --> 01:08:01,164
Hello.

498
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:08,296
Well, we've got beds with clean sheets
and a boiler that produces hot water.

499
01:08:08,379 --> 01:08:10,798
So you can all have a shower.

500
01:08:10,882 --> 01:08:14,218
You look like you need one. Please.

501
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:39,368
It ain't funny. I got loads of cooking to do,
you fucking Doris!

502
01:08:40,453 --> 01:08:42,580
Run him over!

503
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:48,085
<i>How is she doing?</i>

504
01:08:48,169 --> 01:08:51,339
She's lost her dad, Jim. That's how she is.

505
01:08:54,008 --> 01:08:56,511
It's all fucked.

506
01:08:56,594 --> 01:08:58,596
What do you mean?

507
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:07,230
Oh, don't do that.
Come on, come on, come on.

508
01:09:07,313 --> 01:09:09,398
Hey, don't do that.

509
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:16,072
Hannah is what Frank says she is. Tough,
strong, and she'll cope just like I'll cope.

510
01:09:16,155 --> 01:09:20,076
- Just like you'll cope.
- I don't want her to have to fucking cope.

511
01:09:21,369 --> 01:09:23,788
I want her to be OK.

512
01:09:25,373 --> 01:09:27,542
When Hannah had her dad it was OK.

513
01:09:27,625 --> 01:09:30,419
It was OK for them and it was OK for us.

514
01:09:33,756 --> 01:09:36,175
Now it's all just fucked.

515
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:10,459
So you heard our broadcast?

516
01:10:10,543 --> 01:10:14,046
- Yeah, we did.
- We must be a disappointment.

517
01:10:14,130 --> 01:10:20,261
You were hoping for a full brigade. An army
base with helicopters and a field hospital.

518
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:26,851
- We were just hoping for...
- The answer to Infection.

519
01:10:29,187 --> 01:10:31,272
Yeah.

520
01:10:31,355 --> 01:10:35,860
As I said before, it's here. Though
it may not be quite what you imagined.

521
01:10:36,235 --> 01:10:39,155
- Just feel lucky to have found you.
- You were lucky.

522
01:10:39,238 --> 01:10:42,366
The fire drove hundreds of Infected
out of Manchester.

523
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,536
The surrounding area's teeming with them.

524
01:10:47,288 --> 01:10:49,916
But don't worry.

525
01:10:49,999 --> 01:10:52,502
You're quite safe here.

526
01:10:55,588 --> 01:11:01,469
Flat terrain all round the house. Floodlights
which we've rigged up to a generator.

527
01:11:02,512 --> 01:11:05,097
High perimeter wall which helps.

528
01:11:05,181 --> 01:11:09,435
And we've been lacing the ground
with tripwires and land mines.

529
01:11:09,519 --> 01:11:14,190
You wouldn't want to mow the lawn,
but if they get in, we hear them.

530
01:11:17,443 --> 01:11:22,365
Secondary to protection,
our real job is to rebuild. Start again.

531
01:11:22,448 --> 01:11:24,867
The belly of the house. The heart.

532
01:11:24,951 --> 01:11:30,206
A wood-fired boiler providing us with hot
water. The first step towards civilisation.

533
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:32,375
The kitchen.

534
01:11:32,458 --> 01:11:34,585
Here you are. I'll swap you.

535
01:11:34,669 --> 01:11:37,880
- Now don't be throwing it.
- Here, give us some.

536
01:11:37,964 --> 01:11:42,009
Don't be fighting.
Will you put that back? Put it back.

537
01:11:42,093 --> 01:11:44,470
Jones, our resident tin opener.

538
01:11:44,554 --> 01:11:47,557
- What are you cooking, Jones?
- Surprise, sir.

539
01:11:48,182 --> 01:11:50,268
I can't wait.

540
01:11:57,775 --> 01:12:00,027
And lastly, meet Mailer.

541
01:12:03,823 --> 01:12:05,783
Mailer, Jim.

542
01:12:05,867 --> 01:12:07,994
Jim, Mailer.

543
01:12:09,328 --> 01:12:11,873
Got infected two days ago.

544
01:12:11,956 --> 01:12:17,044
Mitchell managed to knock him out cold
and we got a chain round his neck.

545
01:12:21,674 --> 01:12:23,759
Keeping him alive?

546
01:12:24,719 --> 01:12:28,764
The idea was to learn something
about Infection.

547
01:12:30,099 --> 01:12:32,185
Have him teach me.

548
01:12:38,858 --> 01:12:40,943
And has he?

549
01:12:43,112 --> 01:12:45,281
In a way.

550
01:12:51,454 --> 01:12:54,874
He's telling me he'll never bake bread.

551
01:12:54,957 --> 01:12:57,126
Farm crops,

552
01:12:57,210 --> 01:12:59,879
raise livestock.

553
01:12:59,962 --> 01:13:02,381
He's telling me he's futureless.

554
01:13:06,511 --> 01:13:11,891
And eventually he'll tell me how long
the Infected take to starve to death.

555
01:13:51,639 --> 01:13:54,100
? You'll have to wait and see

556
01:13:54,183 --> 01:13:56,435
? Hope it's chips, it's chips

557
01:13:56,519 --> 01:13:59,105
? We hope it's chips, it's chips

558
01:14:07,655 --> 01:14:10,074
Hat.

559
01:14:10,158 --> 01:14:12,660
So, what have we here?

560
01:14:15,496 --> 01:14:18,875
Tinned ham, tinned peas, tinned beans and...

561
01:14:23,629 --> 01:14:26,382
<i>- Nice one, Doris!
- Omelette!</i>

562
01:14:26,465 --> 01:14:28,926
- It's a feast, Jones.
- Honour of our guests.

563
01:14:29,010 --> 01:14:32,221
Absolutely. I was going to propose a toast

564
01:14:32,305 --> 01:14:35,433
but this omelette will do just as well.

565
01:14:38,019 --> 01:14:40,521
<i>- To new friends.
- New friends.</i>

566
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:54,911
Jones, did you notice while cooking
that these eggs were off?

567
01:14:54,994 --> 01:14:58,414
I thought the salt might cover the taste, sir.

568
01:14:58,498 --> 01:15:00,374
Get rid of it.

569
01:15:02,835 --> 01:15:05,296
<i>Doris, you twat.</i>

570
01:15:05,379 --> 01:15:08,174
I don't suppose you can cook, can you?

571
01:15:09,008 --> 01:15:14,472
I can't tell you how badly we need
someone with a little flair in the kitchen.

572
01:15:14,555 --> 01:15:19,101
What a fucking disappointment.
I saw those eggs, I thought it was Christmas.

573
01:15:19,185 --> 01:15:22,438
We'll have eggs again.
Once everything's back to normal.

574
01:15:22,522 --> 01:15:25,358
You muppet! Look at him, eh?

575
01:15:25,441 --> 01:15:29,487
He's still waiting
for Marks and Spencer's to reopen.

576
01:15:29,570 --> 01:15:33,908
- You don't know nothing.
- I think Bill's got a point.

577
01:15:33,991 --> 01:15:37,119
If you look at the whole life of the planet,

578
01:15:37,203 --> 01:15:39,121
we...

579
01:15:39,205 --> 01:15:43,334
you know, Man has only been around
for a few blinks of an eye.

580
01:15:44,085 --> 01:15:46,546
So if the infection wipes us all out,

581
01:15:47,547 --> 01:15:49,841
<i>that is a return to normality.</i>

582
01:15:53,845 --> 01:15:56,848
- That what you meant, Bill?
- Yeah, yeah.

583
01:15:56,931 --> 01:16:00,184
Have you met our New Age sergeant?

584
01:16:00,268 --> 01:16:02,979
Our spiritual guru.

585
01:16:03,062 --> 01:16:08,276
Tell me, Farrell, exactly why
did you join the army in the first place?

586
01:16:11,070 --> 01:16:15,199
This is what I've seen
in the four weeks since Infection.

587
01:16:15,283 --> 01:16:17,910
People killing people.

588
01:16:17,994 --> 01:16:22,540
Which is what I saw in the four weeks before
Infection, the four weeks before that...

589
01:16:22,623 --> 01:16:28,087
As far back as I care to remember,
people killing people.

590
01:16:28,171 --> 01:16:31,799
Which to my mind
puts us in a state of normality now.

591
01:16:40,099 --> 01:16:43,060
- You're not eating?
- I don't want to eat.

592
01:16:43,144 --> 01:16:45,938
You must eat, Hannah.

593
01:16:46,022 --> 01:16:49,275
I don't want to eat.
I want to bury my dad.

594
01:16:50,193 --> 01:16:53,321
He's one of the people you're talking about.

595
01:16:57,408 --> 01:16:59,452
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

596
01:17:00,161 --> 01:17:02,497
Move!

597
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:04,874
Move! Move! Move!

598
01:17:13,758 --> 01:17:15,843
Enemy in front!

599
01:17:48,668 --> 01:17:51,170
Mick, I fucking got one!

600
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:54,882
What do you want, a fucking sweetie?
Keep shooting, you cunt!

601
01:18:07,520 --> 01:18:09,814
Fucking hell! He bounced!

602
01:18:09,897 --> 01:18:11,482
Cease fire!

603
01:18:11,566 --> 01:18:13,860
I ain't never seen that in my life!

604
01:18:13,943 --> 01:18:16,612
- Report clear!
- Fucking hell!

605
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:18,406
- Clear.
- Clear.

606
01:18:18,489 --> 01:18:19,615
Yeah, yeah, clear.

607
01:18:30,209 --> 01:18:32,295
Oh, hello!

608
01:18:36,507 --> 01:18:42,138
Listen, sweetheart, you ain't
gonna be needing this any more.

609
01:18:42,221 --> 01:18:44,432
Cos you got me to protect you now.

610
01:18:46,225 --> 01:18:51,522
You wanna get your hands on a really
big chopper, you just come and see me.

611
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:53,065
Fuck you!

612
01:18:53,149 --> 01:18:55,318
- That's an offer, Mitch.
- Give her some.

613
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:57,403
How about right now?

614
01:18:58,070 --> 01:18:59,947
Mitchell!

615
01:19:01,532 --> 01:19:06,037
Easy, tiger. You don't wanna go
picking a fight with me, son.

616
01:19:07,330 --> 01:19:09,957
Sergeant Farrell!

617
01:19:13,753 --> 01:19:16,797
- Mitchell, first action on.
- Resecure the perimeter.

618
01:19:16,881 --> 01:19:20,343
Then get to it. Jones, Bedford, go with him.

619
01:19:22,553 --> 01:19:24,639
Slow down.

620
01:19:27,767 --> 01:19:30,728
- Sergeant?
- Sir.

621
01:19:30,812 --> 01:19:33,523
Clear the bodies off the lawn.

622
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:38,986
The rest of you, go with him.

623
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,246
My apologies.

624
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:53,751
Drink?

625
01:19:58,631 --> 01:20:01,300
Look, we're grateful, OK?

626
01:20:01,384 --> 01:20:05,596
We're very grateful for your protection
but if we're gonna stay here...

627
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:07,223
- Who have you killed?
- No one.

628
01:20:07,306 --> 01:20:12,478
Who have you killed? You wouldn't be alive
now if you hadn't killed somebody.

629
01:20:19,735 --> 01:20:22,864
I killed... I killed a boy.

630
01:20:27,201 --> 01:20:29,287
A child?

631
01:20:30,663 --> 01:20:32,748
Yes.

632
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:39,297
But you had to.
Otherwise he'd have killed you.

633
01:20:42,842 --> 01:20:44,719
Survival.

634
01:20:48,139 --> 01:20:50,224
I understand.

635
01:20:52,602 --> 01:20:55,104
I promised them women.

636
01:20:57,064 --> 01:20:59,150
What?

637
01:21:00,276 --> 01:21:04,071
Eight days ago I found Jones
with his gun in his mouth.

638
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:09,952
He said he was going to kill himself
because there was no future.

639
01:21:10,036 --> 01:21:12,914
What could I say to him?

640
01:21:12,997 --> 01:21:18,211
We fight off the Infected or we wait
until they starve to death and then what?

641
01:21:19,128 --> 01:21:22,965
What do nine men do
except wait to die themselves?

642
01:21:23,049 --> 01:21:29,180
I moved us from the blockade, I set the radio
broadcasting and I promised them women.

643
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:35,895
Because women mean a future.

644
01:21:43,903 --> 01:21:45,988
Selena! Hannah!

645
01:21:46,739 --> 01:21:48,533
- What is it?
- We have to go.

646
01:21:48,616 --> 01:21:50,701
- Jim, wait!
- No time! Come on!

647
01:21:53,663 --> 01:21:55,706
Come on!

648
01:21:56,833 --> 01:21:58,793
We get in the car and we go!

649
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:04,715
No! You're not going to keep them here!
You've got to let them go!

650
01:22:04,799 --> 01:22:08,052
You can't keep them here!
Stay where you are!

651
01:22:08,136 --> 01:22:10,847
I'm not gonna let you keep them here!

652
01:22:10,930 --> 01:22:12,849
You can't do this!

653
01:22:15,434 --> 01:22:17,728
Right, get him!

654
01:22:24,777 --> 01:22:27,113
I want to give you a chance.

655
01:22:27,196 --> 01:22:29,323
You can be with us.

656
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,244
But I can't let them go.

657
01:22:38,875 --> 01:22:41,460
OK, Jim? OK.

658
01:22:46,132 --> 01:22:48,217
Him too.

659
01:23:01,314 --> 01:23:04,066
<i>Smithers says
"Women and semen don't mix. "</i>

660
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:07,069
And Mr Burns says
"We all know what you think, Smithers. "

661
01:23:07,153 --> 01:23:10,072
<i>And that was my favourite joke
in The Simpsons.</i>

662
01:23:10,156 --> 01:23:13,784
That's what they're doing a few
hundred miles away, across the Channel,

663
01:23:13,868 --> 01:23:18,289
<i>across the Atlantic. Eating dinner
and watching the fucking Simpsons!</i>

664
01:23:18,372 --> 01:23:21,667
They're sleeping in their beds
next to their wives.

665
01:23:21,751 --> 01:23:27,465
But we're here chained to a fucking radiator
because the OC has gone insane!

666
01:23:28,508 --> 01:23:32,553
Starting the world again when the rest
of the world hasn't even stopped.

667
01:23:33,930 --> 01:23:37,058
Just imagine, just think about it.

668
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:40,394
How could Infection cross the oceans?

669
01:23:40,478 --> 01:23:44,774
How could it cross the mountains
and the rivers? It can be stopped.

670
01:23:44,857 --> 01:23:47,568
Right now TVs are playing
and planes are flying

671
01:23:47,652 --> 01:23:51,656
and the rest of the world
is continuing as fucking normal.

672
01:23:51,739 --> 01:23:55,076
<i>Think! Actually think about it.</i>

673
01:23:55,952 --> 01:23:59,539
What would you do
with a diseased little island?

674
01:24:03,709 --> 01:24:05,795
They quarantined us.

675
01:24:08,297 --> 01:24:12,677
"There is no Infection.
It's just people killing people. " He's insane!

676
01:24:21,477 --> 01:24:23,938
Time to go.

677
01:24:25,314 --> 01:24:27,400
Quarantine?

678
01:24:59,223 --> 01:25:02,351
- Please...
- Believe me, I'm not interested.

679
01:25:03,436 --> 01:25:08,566
You see, I'm gonna have the black one.
And I'm gonna make her squirm.

680
01:25:08,649 --> 01:25:12,570
Mitchell, I swear to God
it's gonna end badly for you.

681
01:25:12,653 --> 01:25:14,363
Move.

682
01:25:14,447 --> 01:25:16,324
Come on, move! Get up!

683
01:25:16,407 --> 01:25:18,493
Get up, you cunt! Fucking move!

684
01:25:18,576 --> 01:25:20,119
Get up!

685
01:25:20,203 --> 01:25:22,455
Move your fucking arse!

686
01:25:43,476 --> 01:25:46,896
<i>Come on then,
you fucking pansies. Do me first.</i>

687
01:25:46,979 --> 01:25:49,482
<i>No, Mitch. Mitch, just use the gat.</i>

688
01:25:49,565 --> 01:25:52,610
<i>- So you're gonna stick me?
- Shoot 'em!</i>

689
01:25:52,693 --> 01:25:55,363
<i>- Why?
- Because it's fucking quicker!</i>

690
01:25:55,446 --> 01:25:58,491
<i>Is that how you'd let
your sergeant go out, Jones?</i>

691
01:25:58,574 --> 01:26:00,493
- I'll shoot them!
- No, you won't.

692
01:26:00,576 --> 01:26:04,038
You'll let him stick me?
Like a fucking dog?

693
01:26:07,667 --> 01:26:09,544
I'm gonna enjoy this.

694
01:26:13,339 --> 01:26:17,301
You stupid cunt! What are you doing?
You wanna shoot me?

695
01:26:17,385 --> 01:26:21,556
- You wanna shoot me? I'll kill you!
- Where's he fucking gone?

696
01:26:22,807 --> 01:26:25,643
Fuck it! Get up! Get after him!

697
01:26:28,146 --> 01:26:31,357
- Jones, move it!
- I can see him! I can see him!

698
01:26:31,440 --> 01:26:33,526
Where are you?

699
01:26:41,117 --> 01:26:43,035
- Can you see him?
- Through there!

700
01:26:51,794 --> 01:26:54,297
Oh no. We're fucked.

701
01:26:55,465 --> 01:26:56,966
We're fucked!

702
01:26:57,049 --> 01:26:58,426
Relax.

703
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:01,971
He's over the wall. He's got no vehicle.

704
01:27:02,054 --> 01:27:04,807
And no shooter.

705
01:27:04,891 --> 01:27:06,225
He's dead.

706
01:27:41,010 --> 01:27:44,972
<i>The first thing we're going to do
is make you look more presentable.</i>

707
01:27:45,056 --> 01:27:48,643
The lady of the house
has an extensive wardrobe

708
01:27:48,726 --> 01:27:51,270
which she certainly has no use for.

709
01:27:52,271 --> 01:27:54,106
You can't do it to Hannah.

710
01:27:54,190 --> 01:27:57,902
Go to the master bedroom,
pick out a wide selection.

711
01:27:57,985 --> 01:28:00,071
Yes, sir.

712
01:28:03,449 --> 01:28:05,535
<i>No...</i>

713
01:28:06,577 --> 01:28:08,663
<i>Ladies...</i>

714
01:28:11,415 --> 01:28:14,210
- It's only dressing up!
- No! Selena!

715
01:28:14,293 --> 01:28:17,630
- I thought girls liked dressing up.
- Expensive dresses.

716
01:28:17,713 --> 01:28:19,340
<i>Selena!</i>

717
01:28:19,423 --> 01:28:21,509
Whoa, whoa, relax!

718
01:28:22,593 --> 01:28:24,178
Selena!

719
01:28:31,894 --> 01:28:34,355
Selena! Selena!

720
01:28:36,399 --> 01:28:40,528
You need to leave me alone
with Hannah. OK?

721
01:28:42,405 --> 01:28:46,117
- Listen, right. The OC wants...
- He wants us to dress up nice.

722
01:28:46,200 --> 01:28:50,371
If you want us to get changed,
you have to leave the room. OK?

723
01:29:01,340 --> 01:29:03,718
It's just polite.

724
01:29:09,682 --> 01:29:12,226
Yeah, all right.

725
01:29:12,310 --> 01:29:14,061
All right.

726
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:17,023
Come on, lads. Let's leave the room.

727
01:29:40,087 --> 01:29:44,050
We're gonna eat these, Hannah, OK?
Come on. Eat these.

728
01:29:44,133 --> 01:29:46,302
Are you trying to kill me?

729
01:29:46,427 --> 01:29:48,638
No, sweetheart.

730
01:29:48,721 --> 01:29:51,265
I'm making you not care. OK?

731
01:29:52,558 --> 01:29:54,811
What you doing?!

732
01:29:59,357 --> 01:30:01,859
- Someone's at the blockade!
- Jim!

733
01:30:01,943 --> 01:30:03,152
Move!

734
01:30:03,236 --> 01:30:05,905
Stay here and put the dresses on.

735
01:30:05,988 --> 01:30:07,532
Let's go! Go!

736
01:30:11,744 --> 01:30:14,330
He went over the wall.
We thought he'd be dead.

737
01:30:14,413 --> 01:30:17,083
Shut up, Jones! Stay here.

738
01:32:25,628 --> 01:32:27,713
Davis?

739
01:33:02,415 --> 01:33:04,250
Fuck it!

740
01:33:55,968 --> 01:33:59,138
- What was that?
- Lightning.

741
01:34:00,056 --> 01:34:02,141
I heard something.

742
01:34:04,393 --> 01:34:06,854
It sounded like a Claymore to me.

743
01:34:07,897 --> 01:34:11,859
All right, I'll go and hit the floods,
take a butcher's.

744
01:34:12,652 --> 01:34:14,529
Girls,

745
01:34:14,612 --> 01:34:17,240
keep an eye on him, will ya?

746
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:30,336
Those pills,

747
01:34:30,419 --> 01:34:32,922
I think they're having an effect.

748
01:34:33,005 --> 01:34:35,508
I can feel them. And...

749
01:34:36,634 --> 01:34:39,011
I don't feel sleepy.

750
01:34:39,095 --> 01:34:41,180
But...

751
01:34:44,058 --> 01:34:46,561
They've been a long time.

752
01:34:48,479 --> 01:34:51,357
What are you gonna do
if they don't come back?

753
01:34:52,108 --> 01:34:55,194
Would you be the officer if Henry was dead?

754
01:34:55,278 --> 01:34:57,280
Is that the way it works?

755
01:34:57,363 --> 01:34:59,448
Shut up.

756
01:35:00,825 --> 01:35:04,912
I don't think they are coming back.
I think they've been killed.

757
01:35:04,996 --> 01:35:07,582
- I said shut up!
- Hannah...

758
01:35:09,167 --> 01:35:11,252
They're dead.

759
01:35:12,295 --> 01:35:14,797
And you're gonna be next.

760
01:35:20,970 --> 01:35:23,264
- Get up!
- Whoa!

761
01:35:23,848 --> 01:35:26,976
We're gonna get out of here.
Stay with it, Hannah.

762
01:35:27,059 --> 01:35:29,896
Don't worry. I feel fine. Really.

763
01:35:31,189 --> 01:35:33,274
Get him off me!

764
01:35:34,484 --> 01:35:36,777
Get him off me!

765
01:35:38,654 --> 01:35:40,573
It's Jones! It's Jones!

766
01:35:51,959 --> 01:35:57,507
Oi! Where the fuck are you going?
What's all the fucking shouting about?

767
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:08,851
Don't just stand there,
you soppy cunt! Get after them!

768
01:36:08,935 --> 01:36:10,937
You two, in there! Move!

769
01:36:29,247 --> 01:36:31,207
Come on, then!

770
01:36:31,290 --> 01:36:34,252
What the fuck you gonna do now?

771
01:36:54,939 --> 01:36:57,066
Come on up!

772
01:36:57,984 --> 01:36:59,694
Col!

773
01:37:00,820 --> 01:37:04,574
- Defend these stairs with your fucking life!
- Hannah!

774
01:37:04,657 --> 01:37:06,784
- Mailer's loose.
- Hannah!

775
01:38:19,065 --> 01:38:21,150
Sorry...

776
01:38:27,573 --> 01:38:29,659
- Sir...
- Shh.

777
01:38:33,329 --> 01:38:35,414
Shh.

778
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,773
Hannah?

779
01:39:48,488 --> 01:39:50,573
Hannah?

780
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,158
Selena?

781
01:40:03,294 --> 01:40:07,673
I haven't got any bullets.
I haven't got any fucking bullets!

782
01:40:12,136 --> 01:40:14,806
Don't fucking leave me!

783
01:40:59,934 --> 01:41:01,686
Come on!

784
01:41:03,646 --> 01:41:05,690
Move!

785
01:41:05,773 --> 01:41:08,401
Move! Move!

786
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:15,867
It's just you and me now, darlin'.
But don't worry, I'll get you out of here.

787
01:41:15,950 --> 01:41:20,413
Then we'll find a nice little fucking place
somewhere. Just you and me.

788
01:41:20,496 --> 01:41:22,832
And we'll live happy ever after, eh?

789
01:42:27,188 --> 01:42:29,690
That was longer than a heartbeat.

790
01:42:32,527 --> 01:42:34,612
Jim?

791
01:42:43,955 --> 01:42:47,500
Listen. Listen. It's not all fucked.

792
01:42:53,256 --> 01:42:55,758
We're gonna be OK. It's not all fucked.

793
01:42:55,842 --> 01:42:59,178
- I've got to explain something.
- Shut up.

794
01:42:59,929 --> 01:43:02,223
It's gonna be OK.

795
01:43:07,687 --> 01:43:11,274
Hannah, it's OK! He's not infected.

796
01:43:11,357 --> 01:43:13,442
But I thought he was biting you.

797
01:43:13,526 --> 01:43:16,195
I was kissing her. Are you stoned?

798
01:43:16,279 --> 01:43:18,447
<i>It's a long story.</i>

799
01:43:18,531 --> 01:43:20,658
We have to get out of here. Come on!

800
01:43:23,452 --> 01:43:25,538
Come on! Move!

801
01:43:32,545 --> 01:43:34,714
You killed all my boys.

802
01:43:34,797 --> 01:43:36,466
Wait...

803
01:43:43,848 --> 01:43:45,349
Hannah!

804
01:43:45,433 --> 01:43:47,059
Hannah? Hannah!

805
01:43:48,728 --> 01:43:50,938
Hannah!

806
01:44:07,079 --> 01:44:08,664
Get in.

807
01:44:27,642 --> 01:44:29,435
They're locked.

808
01:44:29,519 --> 01:44:31,938
The gates are locked!

809
01:44:34,565 --> 01:44:36,651
Fucking do it!

810
01:44:58,965 --> 01:45:01,384
Come on, Jim, breathe! Fucking breathe!

811
01:45:22,155 --> 01:45:24,448
Not the curtains as well.

812
01:46:35,102 --> 01:46:37,772
You looked all right in this, you know.

813
01:46:38,981 --> 01:46:40,483
It's coming!

814
01:46:57,166 --> 01:46:59,335
- You definitely heard it?
- Yeah!

815
01:46:59,418 --> 01:47:02,755
- I can't hear anything!
- I told you, I heard it!

816
01:47:23,234 --> 01:47:25,069
Go.

817
01:47:58,227 --> 01:48:01,147
Do you think he saw us this time?

818
01:48:02,305 --> 01:49:02,765
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
