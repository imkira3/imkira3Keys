This is it.

3
00:01:10,488 --> 00:01:12,928
This fine trail, we're gonna be
the first ever to complete it.

4
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,617
You're insane, Utah.

5
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,624
- There's no way to ride that.
- There's a way.

6
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:17,996
You just gotta trust.

7
00:01:20,707 --> 00:01:22,834
Come on, Jeff.
This is exactly what our sponsors want.

8
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:27,088
The impossible realized.
And all those YouTube hits.

9
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,798
Anyway, we gotta earn
these bikes we're sittin' on,

10
00:01:30,925 --> 00:01:32,135
and it beats workin' for a livin'.

11
00:01:32,302 --> 00:01:34,137
Yeah, well...
While I'm workin' for a livin',

12
00:01:34,304 --> 00:01:36,904
you'll be suckin' meals through a straw
for the rest of your life.

13
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:38,016
I like smoothies.

14
00:01:40,393 --> 00:01:41,519
We got this, bro'.

15
00:01:42,395 --> 00:01:43,396
Just follow my line.

16
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,156
Utah to Heli, we're doin' this.

17
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,971
Whoo-hoo!

18
00:03:40,638 --> 00:03:41,639
Come on, man!

19
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:54,694
Jeff! Jeff!

20
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,827
- Hold on, hold on!
- Gas to that gas tank!

21
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,579
Pull! Come on, pull!

22
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,443
<i>This is a new world, son.</i>

23
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,656
<i>When you join the FBI,
you join the front line</i>

24
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,866
<i>in the war between order and chaos.</i>

25
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,328
<i>So, the question is,
are you ready for that fight, Utah?</i>

26
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,163
Brigham, sir.

27
00:04:48,873 --> 00:04:49,916
<i>My name's Brigham.</i>

28
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:54,045
Utah's a nickname
my classmates got off YouTube.

29
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,787
That world that you came out of...

30
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,892
Pretty wild, huh?

31
00:05:09,894 --> 00:05:11,229
It had its moments.

32
00:05:13,314 --> 00:05:15,566
Why leave all that

33
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,527
for all this structure?

34
00:05:18,111 --> 00:05:19,362
Maybe I could use some structure, sir.

35
00:05:19,654 --> 00:05:23,074
And maybe there's a part of you
doesn't want anything to do with it. Hmm?

36
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:30,237
I know why you left that world.

37
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:35,461
I know what happened
in that world to that kid.

38
00:05:36,045 --> 00:05:37,255
Jeff, was it?

39
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,591
Yes, sir.

40
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
How bad do you really want this?

41
00:05:43,761 --> 00:05:46,514
Bad enough to have gotten my high school
equivalency at 23, sir.

42
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,850
Bad enough to have gone to college
and law school

43
00:05:49,017 --> 00:05:50,435
five years after my peers had graduated.

44
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,728
Yeah, I saw that.

45
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:56,107
The Bureau reviewed all my credentials
before they admitted me into this program.

46
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,034
I'm not sure why you're
second-guessing them.

47
00:05:58,276 --> 00:05:59,986
Because it's my job, son,

48
00:06:00,153 --> 00:06:02,697
<i>to only let the most qualified
get past me.</i>

49
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,783
Because I'm not convinced
that you are an FBI agent

50
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,285
<i>in the making.</i>

51
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,829
- I want this.
- Well, then, show me.

52
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:13,541
Yes, sir.

53
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:17,879
<i>This is what chaos looks like.</i>

54
00:06:18,046 --> 00:06:19,464
And make no mistake,

55
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,632
these perps were very, very smart.

56
00:06:22,842 --> 00:06:25,219
Had a sense of humor, too.

57
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:28,306
10 million carats of diamonds were lost.

58
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,516
<i>And Mahana Carbon</i>

59
00:06:30,683 --> 00:06:32,163
<i>is a majority American-owned company,</i>

60
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:34,312
so we, the FBI, are interested.

61
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,899
30th of last month was a Friday,

62
00:06:38,066 --> 00:06:41,861
so, the entire month's yield
from the company's mines was on hand.

63
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:45,490
Their mistake was believing
that nobody could ever rob

64
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:48,493
and successfully make a getaway
from a sorting facility

65
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:51,370
100 stories above the Earth.

66
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,082
And their security failed to foresee

67
00:06:54,332 --> 00:06:58,377
that there might exist a set of perps
with an unusual skill set.

68
00:06:59,003 --> 00:07:01,839
They saw potential police intervention
on the ground,

69
00:07:02,215 --> 00:07:03,424
and they improvised.

70
00:07:08,805 --> 00:07:12,100
They got away with 100 million
in uncut diamonds,

71
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:15,103
and then gave it all away
to the poorest of the poor

72
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:17,396
in the slums of Mumbai.

73
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:20,149
Who in the world would do that?

74
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,840
This case is right now.
These guys are out there in real time.

75
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,489
<i>And I need a theory.</i>

76
00:07:27,115 --> 00:07:30,243
What kind of people
are we dealing with here?

77
00:08:07,071 --> 00:08:08,239
Malfunction to ramp override.

78
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,740
Oh, shit!

79
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,544
Sir, what's going on?

80
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:48,839
U.S. plane carrying money got hijacked
over San Luis Potosi in Mexico.

81
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,566
Perps jumped out over the jungle
and disappeared without a trace.

82
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,594
We're looking for the bodies.

83
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,401
Excuse me, sir.

84
00:10:10,069 --> 00:10:11,696
Do you have a minute?

85
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,532
We have two crimes
on two different continents.

86
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:18,327
Diamond-sorting facility in Mumbai,
and today's cargo plane over Mexico.

87
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:21,038
But there's a third crime
on a third continent.

88
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,207
Remember about a month ago,

89
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:25,835
there was an international logging
complex that was burned to the ground

90
00:10:26,127 --> 00:10:27,847
- on the banks of the Congo River...
- Yeah.

91
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:29,714
...which is where
the world's most dangerous rapids are.

92
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,640
Now I think
the people that started that fire

93
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:35,469
also became the first ever to
navigate and survive the Inga Rapids.

94
00:10:35,636 --> 00:10:39,515
You're saying
this is connected to the other two?

95
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,809
I think they're all connected, sir.

96
00:10:42,268 --> 00:10:43,269
Here.

97
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,298
Two days before the Mumbai heist,

98
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,274
only 1,000 miles away,
these three were photographed

99
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,152
base-jumping from the peak of Everest.

100
00:10:52,236 --> 00:10:53,362
<i>They're the same people.</i>

101
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:55,865
Same people...

102
00:10:57,575 --> 00:10:59,952
Then what are they really up to here?

103
00:11:00,119 --> 00:11:02,538
<i>I don't know why
they're committing the crimes, sir.</i>

104
00:11:02,705 --> 00:11:04,305
<i>But I have an idea what they're chasing.</i>

105
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:08,753
I think they're attempting
something called The Ozaki Eight.

106
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:16,135
This is Ono Ozaki.

107
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,803
He was an eco-warrior,

108
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,806
one of the first recognized
Extreme Poly-Athletes.

109
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:24,352
<i>Now he challenged the Extreme Sports world
to a series</i>

110
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:28,105
<i>of eight ordeals that he said
honored the forces of nature.</i>

111
00:11:30,691 --> 00:11:33,069
Anyone who could find
the perfect line existing

112
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:37,948
through each one of these ordeals,
he believed, would achieve nirvana.

113
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:42,161
So, this is not about money?

114
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,955
It's about spiritual enlightenment?

115
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,582
Exactly.

116
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:50,586
An extreme athlete could potentially train

117
00:11:50,753 --> 00:11:54,048
their entire life
just to attempt one of these ordeals.

118
00:11:55,591 --> 00:11:59,136
To complete all eight,
would be to complete the impossible.

119
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:04,141
No one's ever done it.

120
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:06,977
Ozaki himself died
attempting his third ordeal.

121
00:12:07,645 --> 00:12:10,022
These guys have already
completed the first three.

122
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,983
"Emerging Force" in Africa.

123
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,986
"Birth of Sky" on Everest.

124
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:18,197
And "Awakening Earth" in Mexico.

125
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:25,538
What's number four?

126
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:27,998
It's called "Life of Water."

127
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,168
The National Weather Service

128
00:12:31,335 --> 00:12:33,379
is tracking a low-pressure system
in the Atlantic.

129
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:35,946
<i>A massive storm about to hit off the coast
of western France.</i>

130
00:12:36,298 --> 00:12:38,634
<i>And when it clears,
it's gonna cause a giant swell.</i>

131
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:42,179
We're talkin' once-in-a-decade waves.

132
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,515
Eighty feet-plus.

133
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:49,019
Sir, if I'm right,
that's where they'll be.

134
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:52,022
You own a suit, son?

135
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:56,110
<i>Before finding my way to the FBI,</i>

136
00:12:56,444 --> 00:12:58,696
<i>I was what's called
an Extreme Sports Poly-Athlete.</i>

137
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,407
Snowboarding, motocross,

138
00:13:01,574 --> 00:13:03,033
any downhill mountain sport, really.

139
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:05,161
<i>And a few up.</i>

140
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,037
<i>Hall!</i>

141
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:08,956
I'm supposed to be on a plane to Mexico
in half an hour.

142
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:10,207
Why am I listening to this?

143
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:11,417
Five minutes.

144
00:13:11,709 --> 00:13:14,128
I believe the people
behind the robberies in Mexico

145
00:13:14,295 --> 00:13:17,047
as well as the one in Mumbai
are extreme athletes.

146
00:13:17,423 --> 00:13:18,424
Isn't that obvious?

147
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:21,051
I don't think
you ride a motorcycle off a building,

148
00:13:21,218 --> 00:13:23,018
or skydive out of a cargo plane
if you aren't.

149
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,351
That last pair
cratered somewhere in the jungle.

150
00:13:25,723 --> 00:13:28,100
I don't think they went
into the jungle at all.

151
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:30,561
<i>I think they went through it.</i>

152
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,564
Cave of the Swallows.

153
00:13:33,731 --> 00:13:36,484
<i>This is the largest
natural cave shaft on Earth.</i>

154
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,320
The Empire State Building
could literally fit inside it.

155
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:42,656
And it just happens to be located
adjacent to San Luis Potosi.

156
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:44,867
<i>The perps knew that.</i>

157
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,661
They surgically identified
the perfect line

158
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:49,163
that would intersect them with the jungle

159
00:13:49,455 --> 00:13:51,207

00:29:13,002 --> 00:29:14,722
about something going down
in Paris tonight.

322
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,716
I gotta go check that out.

323
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,230
<i>I like you, kid,</i>

324
00:29:32,522 --> 00:29:33,882
<i>but if you wanna stay on the case,</i>

325
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,650
you gotta give me some evidence.

326
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:37,861
You got it.

327
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,539
- Excuse me. Train station?
- What?

328
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:51,458
Thank you.

329
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,300
Let him in.

330
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:48,181
It wouldn't be the first time
he did something stupid.

331
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,154
♪ ♪

332
00:31:34,227 --> 00:31:35,311
Small world.

333
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,816
What's he doing here?

334
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:42,026
I told him to meet us here.

335
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,656
Oh, you did?

336
00:31:46,823 --> 00:31:48,283
Yeah.

337
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,816
He said he was after something.

338
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,164
No better place to find it.

339
00:31:56,499 --> 00:31:57,500
<i>Okay, then.</i>

340
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,337
Welcome.

341
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:18,271
I just came to catch the scene, man.

342
00:32:19,314 --> 00:32:20,356
You're catchin' it.

343
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:38,374
Let go.

344
00:32:57,852 --> 00:32:58,895
There you are.

345
00:33:19,582 --> 00:33:20,958
I think I know what I'm after.

346
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:23,753
You don't know shit.

347
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,530
I'm headed out tonight
to find us a mountain,

348
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:52,017
and hopefully arrive at the line.

349
00:33:52,156 --> 00:33:53,533
How long you think it'll take?

350
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,618
Maybe a week.

351
00:33:55,785 --> 00:33:56,953
Good luck, brother.

352
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,955
Give me a minute.

353
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:52,300
It's pretty decent.

354
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:57,847
There are a few things in life
I don't compromise on.

355
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:01,267
No, I don't get the impression
you compromise on much ever.

356
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,811
Try not to.

357
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:08,775
But the world's a pretty messed-up place,
and I still gotta live in it.

358
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:11,027
So, you live off the grid?

359
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,696
No.

360
00:35:14,363 --> 00:35:16,032
We live on it.

361
00:35:17,575 --> 00:35:18,868
Just on our own terms.

362
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:22,955
What terms?

363
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,083
You wouldn't get it.

364
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:29,879
We change the grid. We give back.

365
00:35:31,422 --> 00:35:34,509
The second that kid got killed
on your line, you quit life.

366
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,765
You turned away
because of something someone else did.

367
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:44,769
You were selling sports drinks?

368
00:35:45,144 --> 00:35:47,647
Fine. That's not for me to judge.

369
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:51,901
But you let someone else determine
the direction your life took.

370
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,821
That I judge.

371
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:05,206
So, you got all your shit figured out,
and screw everyone else for trying, huh?

372
00:36:06,082 --> 00:36:07,500
Is that it?

373
00:36:20,346 --> 00:36:22,223
Ozaki's ordeal.

374
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,518
<i>Life of Wind.</i>

375
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,522
You doing anything?

376
00:36:31,274 --> 00:36:33,067
We've got nothing.

377
00:36:33,234 --> 00:36:35,027
He'll probably be
on a plane in the morning.

378
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,654
Hang on a minute.

379
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:38,281
Shit!

380
00:36:43,202 --> 00:36:44,912
Change of plans.

381
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:01,178
<i>I guess Bodhi
sees something in you.</i>

382
00:37:02,972 --> 00:37:04,765
I don't.

383
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:09,979
We leave for the Alps first light.

384
00:37:10,271 --> 00:37:11,981
You coming?

385
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,412
How long's the hike?

386
00:37:26,579 --> 00:37:28,456
Depends how fast you are, man.

387
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,984
We still have a long way to go, my friend.

388
00:38:02,782 --> 00:38:04,033
That's the summit.

389
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:07,328
Half a mile of pure primordial rock.

390
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:09,719
<i>Maybe I should have
asked you this before,</i>

391
00:38:09,956 --> 00:38:11,290
but you've done this, right?

392
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,458
<i>Sure.</i>

393
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:15,044
Except it was out of a plane.

394
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:18,464
Proximity flight's
a whole different monster.

395
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:22,051
You need to read the flow.

396
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:24,470
Become the wind.

397
00:38:24,804 --> 00:38:25,930
Or you'll hit your point.

398
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:27,890
What point?

399
00:38:28,516 --> 00:38:30,226
The point where you break.

400
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:33,896
Where fear becomes master,
and you're its slave.

401
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,566
<i>A man who pushes his boundaries</i>

402
00:38:38,818 --> 00:38:40,277
ultimately finds them.

403
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:44,240
So, basically,
you're sayin' I'm gonna die.

404
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:46,242
We're all gonna die.

405
00:38:46,617 --> 00:38:48,077
The only question's how.

406
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:49,996
<i>So,</i>

407
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:54,875
you wanna keep going,
or are you turning around?

408
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,021
Here he is.

409
00:39:18,149 --> 00:39:19,233
Hey, the rock.

410
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,110
What rock?

411
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:23,946
You heard the man. Pass the rock.

412
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:34,874
Oh, you funny assholes!

413
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:36,901
Should have checked your bag, man.

414
00:39:37,585 --> 00:39:39,128
Always check your bag.

415
00:39:40,463 --> 00:39:42,965
<i>Ah! Great work.</i>

416
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,052
- This rock?
- You have another one?

417
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:48,512
All right.

418
00:39:50,723 --> 00:39:51,807
Ready?

419
00:40:01,442 --> 00:40:02,443
Six seconds.

420
00:40:03,986 --> 00:40:06,489
Six seconds to fly or die.

421
00:40:45,194 --> 00:40:46,362
When do we go?

422
00:40:47,279 --> 00:40:48,280
First light.

423
00:40:52,326 --> 00:40:54,036
Happening in six days.

424
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,794
So, we're gonna jump off a mountain
and reach nirvana?

425
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:07,258
<i>It's not that simple.</i>

426
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:11,262
Ozaki spoke of balance.

427
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:17,143
But it's not about risking our lives
for personal gain.

428
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:22,398
It is about becoming part of something
that is much greater than ourselves.

429
00:41:24,692 --> 00:41:27,695
<i>The Eight honors the
essential forces of the Earth.</i>

430
00:41:29,071 --> 00:41:30,614
And Ozaki wanted to complete The Eight

431
00:41:30,781 --> 00:41:34,160
to bring the world's attention back
to the beauty of this planet.

432
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,247
The fact that it is dying.

433
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,960
We have to give more than we take

434
00:41:44,503 --> 00:41:48,257
if we want to stop the destruction
of the very place that gives us life.

435
00:41:49,675 --> 00:41:51,468
That's the path we're on.

436
00:41:53,512 --> 00:41:54,712
That's what we're looking for.

437
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:58,767
That's what we're following.

438
00:42:01,437 --> 00:42:04,106
We're not here to reach enlightenment,
to find nirvana.

439
00:42:05,399 --> 00:42:09,153
We're here to try to save this place
by becoming one with it.

440
00:42:11,989 --> 00:42:15,284
<i>And to do that, you need to be able
to let go of your sense of self.</i>

441
00:42:16,035 --> 00:42:17,077
<i>Completely.</i>

442
00:42:17,995 --> 00:42:20,039
There's no turning back.

443
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:27,755
So, go whichever way
your heart tells you, Utah.

444
00:42:30,841 --> 00:42:33,260
And if you are on
the same path as we are,

445
00:42:34,803 --> 00:42:36,513
I may see you at dawn.

446
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,341
Are you ready to let go?

447
00:43:15,719 --> 00:43:17,513
Let's do this.

448
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:08,559
You did it!

449
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:13,397
- Yeah!
- Whoo-hoo!

450
00:46:19,736 --> 00:46:20,737
Congratulations.

451
00:46:20,904 --> 00:46:22,531
Thanks, man.

452
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,576
Yeah!

453
00:46:25,701 --> 00:46:26,869
That's how you do it.

454
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:36,420
Yeah! Yeah!

455
00:47:00,611 --> 00:47:01,612
Whoo!

456
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,447
- You guys ready?
- Oh, yeah.

457
00:47:45,781 --> 00:47:47,574
- Here you go.
- Let me see.

458
00:47:49,618 --> 00:47:51,787
- It's a little dry.
- Tastes good.

459
00:47:59,044 --> 00:48:00,796
- All right?
- Yeah.

460
00:48:01,004 --> 00:48:02,673
Ready?

461
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:14,142
Welcome, Johnny.

462
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:15,477
Thank you.

463
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:16,812
Let's eat.

464
00:48:17,145 --> 00:48:18,981
- Yeah.
- Okay.

465
00:48:53,974 --> 00:48:55,434
My mom was a Ute Indian.

466
00:48:57,436 --> 00:48:59,438
That's why they call me Utah.

467
00:49:01,773 --> 00:49:03,066
Means "mountain people."

468
00:49:05,444 --> 00:49:07,988
Maybe that's why
I was so good on the slopes.

469
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:13,452
Jeff was like a brother to me.
More than a friend.

470
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:17,706
And he died because of me.

471
00:49:19,791 --> 00:49:22,377
What happened to your friend was tragic.

472
00:49:25,881 --> 00:49:27,424
But it was his choice, not yours.

473
00:49:33,013 --> 00:49:35,766
We can only be responsible
for our own path, brother.

474
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:40,937
And let others have theirs.

475
00:49:52,449 --> 00:49:54,826
<i>"Life of Ice." The Sixth Ordeal.</i>

476
00:49:55,869 --> 00:50:00,332
<i>Chowder found the mountain in Italy,
but not the line.</i>

477
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:11,426
You gotta find a line,
you gotta do it fast.

478
00:50:11,593 --> 00:50:14,888
Weather's rolling in. You don't wanna get
caught up here when it does.

479
00:50:15,055 --> 00:50:17,766
If this rock's even rideable.

480
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:19,768
What about that one over there?

481
00:50:19,935 --> 00:50:21,103
Definitely first descent.

482
00:50:21,436 --> 00:50:23,438
- No.
- No?

483
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:25,190
Not radical enough for you?

484
00:50:26,441 --> 00:50:27,776
It's radical enough.

485
00:50:27,943 --> 00:50:29,611
Then what's wrong with it?

486
00:50:30,112 --> 00:50:31,113
It's not beautiful.

487

That's not beautiful. That's death.

Maybe. But it's also perfect.

489

Shit...

490
00:50:56,388 --> 00:50:57,389

Man, I see a lot of taking
on the way to enlightenment.

What's being given back?

549
00:59:06,419 --> 00:59:08,046
Yeah, mostly.

550
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:10,840
Are you okay?

551
00:59:13,468 --> 00:59:14,469
I don't know.

552
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:17,972
Thinkin' about losing Chowder.

553
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,018
If any of this party
is what Ozaki had in mind

554
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:23,394
for the path to enlightenment.

555
00:59:26,606 --> 00:59:28,691
Ozaki would have hated this.

556
00:59:29,734 --> 00:59:31,945
He only cared about
the purity of The Eight

557
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:35,657
and giving back whatever
he took from the Earth

558
00:59:35,823 --> 00:59:36,943
on the way to getting there.

559
00:59:37,825 --> 00:59:39,869
And what did he give back?

560
00:59:40,536 --> 00:59:45,208
Sometimes it was as simple
as planting a tree.

561
00:59:46,501 --> 00:59:50,380
Other times, it was something much larger.

562
00:59:50,964 --> 00:59:54,759
Like when my parents died
in an avalanche when I was nine,

563
00:59:54,926 --> 00:59:56,427
he gave me a home.

564
01:00:00,974 --> 01:00:02,517
I didn't know.

565
01:00:03,351 --> 01:00:05,144
<i>Sorry.</i>

566
01:00:07,563 --> 01:00:11,359
I know that he died
questing his third ordeal.

567
01:00:11,859 --> 01:00:14,696
Yeah. That's the story.

568
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,030
But it's not the truth.

569
01:00:17,824 --> 01:00:19,450
He completed that ordeal.

570
01:00:20,702 --> 01:00:23,538
He could have finished the entire Eight.

571
01:00:24,205 --> 01:00:26,124
He was that good.

572
01:00:29,961 --> 01:00:34,716
But instead he got himself killed
giving back for that ordeal.

573
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,094
How?

574
01:00:41,097 --> 01:00:45,184
He positioned his small boat
in the North Atlantic

575
01:00:46,227 --> 01:00:51,232
between a Norwegian whaling ship
and a pod of humpback whales.

576
01:00:53,609 --> 01:00:56,237
The whaling ship never even slowed.

577
01:00:57,739 --> 01:01:01,617
The only survivor was a young guy
who was on the boat with him.

578
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:05,163
Well, why didn't
this young guy say something?

579
01:01:05,330 --> 01:01:06,490
Why didn't he tell the world?

580
01:01:07,623 --> 01:01:09,876
Maybe he had other ideas.

581
01:01:12,128 --> 01:01:14,630
It wouldn't have made a difference anyway.

582
01:01:16,924 --> 01:01:21,721
As much as I worshipped Ozaki,

583
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:23,931
that was his Achilles' heel.

584
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:32,440
He truly believed that
he could change the world with an idea.

585
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:36,611
Ideas can be powerful.

586
01:01:39,489 --> 01:01:41,366
Not as powerful as a whaling ship.

587
01:01:47,872 --> 01:01:51,459
If not ideas, then what else is there?

588
01:01:53,503 --> 01:01:55,088
Action.

589
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:01,386
That young guy on the boat.

590
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:04,472
That was Bodhi, wasn't it?

591
01:02:05,598 --> 01:02:09,310
Bodhi is going to complete
what Ozaki set out to do.

592
01:02:10,937 --> 01:02:13,064
He's going to take
a different path to do it.

593
01:02:21,322 --> 01:02:23,491
So, here we are.

594
01:03:37,106 --> 01:03:38,399
Came as fast as I could.

595
01:03:38,566 --> 01:03:39,775
Yeah. It's been 12 days.

596
01:03:40,067 --> 01:03:42,403
I saw an opportunity.
I couldn't break cover.

597
01:03:43,654 --> 01:03:46,991
I put a 24-hour surveillance
on Al Fariq's hideaway.

598
01:03:48,075 --> 01:03:49,785
I know exactly what you were doing.

599
01:03:57,835 --> 01:03:59,128
Criminal masterminds?

600
01:03:59,921 --> 01:04:01,714
They're just kids
partying away their lives

601
01:04:01,881 --> 01:04:02,882
on Al Fariq's dime.

602
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,676
The difference between them and you,

603
01:04:05,843 --> 01:04:07,470
is you're doing it on the FBI's.

604
01:04:08,554 --> 01:04:09,597
Pappas...

605
01:04:13,601 --> 01:04:14,852
Where does that leave you, huh?

606
01:04:15,019 --> 01:04:16,979
Hangin' out on this dock
while I'm onto something?

607
01:04:17,063 --> 01:04:18,481
You're onto shit!

608
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:22,443
Now I'm sorry if this particular locale
lacks the glamour you're accustomed to

609
01:04:22,693 --> 01:04:23,736
because there's no drugs,

610
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,696
or naked girls shakin' their arses.

611
01:04:26,364 --> 01:04:28,533
But that's why we stayed down
'ere all night.

612
01:04:28,699 --> 01:04:31,744
To prove that wasn't an American mine
that blew that piece of shit up!

613
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:35,957
For your information,
this is how the real FBI works.

614
01:04:36,541 --> 01:04:41,837
It's dirty, it's pedestrian,
and generally downright boring!

615
01:04:42,547 --> 01:04:44,757
I can figure this out, Pappas!

616
01:04:45,758 --> 01:04:47,385
I just need more time.

617
01:05:02,525 --> 01:05:03,526
You've been gone a day.

618
01:05:03,985 --> 01:05:05,145
Where the fuck have you been?

619
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,823
<i>Ready to start talkin'
about giving back?</i>

620
01:05:18,916 --> 01:05:20,126
She gives.

621
01:05:20,293 --> 01:05:21,460
We partake.

622
01:05:21,627 --> 01:05:23,337
And then we give her an offering.

623
01:05:23,504 --> 01:05:25,464
An offering of what?

624
01:05:25,631 --> 01:05:27,174
<i>That mine down there</i>

625
01:05:27,466 --> 01:05:30,177
has been ripping gold out of her guts
for over 20 years.

626
01:05:30,970 --> 01:05:33,055
<i>We're gonna get some of it back for her.</i>

627
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:42,440
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, my man.

628
01:05:42,690 --> 01:05:43,816
Source to source.

629
01:05:45,443 --> 01:05:46,485
You're gonna steal it?

630
01:05:47,069 --> 01:05:48,112
No.

631
01:05:50,031 --> 01:05:51,574
We're going to liberate it.

632
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:11,761
When's this goin' down?

633
01:06:13,971 --> 01:06:15,097
Right now, brother.

634
01:06:32,907 --> 01:06:35,785
I get it, okay?
People are screwing up the world.

635
01:06:36,077 --> 01:06:38,287
And you wanna do something about it,
then you gotta find another way!

636
01:06:38,454 --> 01:06:39,455
The world is burning! Look around!

637
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,248
- Do you have a better idea?
<i>- There's about a hundred ways</i>

638
01:06:41,457 --> 01:06:43,125
this could go really wrong, man.

639
01:06:43,417 --> 01:06:44,418
Explosives like that...

640
01:06:45,294 --> 01:06:47,463
<i>You're gonna cross a line
you can't come back from.</i>

641
01:06:47,672 --> 01:06:49,090
That's the difference between us.

642
01:06:49,423 --> 01:06:50,424
<i>All you see is lines.</i>

643
01:06:51,634 --> 01:06:53,260
We see the truth.

644
01:06:54,887 --> 01:06:56,389
Put that on.

645
01:07:51,527 --> 01:07:53,195
Stay behind me!

646
01:08:14,717 --> 01:08:15,843
No, no!

647
01:08:37,323 --> 01:08:38,574
- Get outta here!
- Get out!

648
01:08:38,741 --> 01:08:40,117
- Leave! Leave!
- Run!

649
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:41,494
Get outta here!

650
01:08:45,456 --> 01:08:47,333
Leave the truck! Run! Run!

651
01:08:47,917 --> 01:08:49,668
Come on, Johnny!

652
01:09:00,888 --> 01:09:02,431
All set.

653
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:16,070
Get out! Get out! Get out of there!

654
01:09:16,237 --> 01:09:18,072
<i>Get out!</i>

655
01:09:21,283 --> 01:09:23,661
Help me! Gimme a hand! Help me!

656
01:09:24,995 --> 01:09:26,038
Put him down here.

657
01:09:30,251 --> 01:09:32,169
Bodhi, freeze, FBI!

658
01:09:33,587 --> 01:09:34,922
I can't let you do it, brother!

659
01:09:37,925 --> 01:09:39,760
Damn it, Bodhi, drop that!

660
01:09:54,275 --> 01:09:56,235
That's it. We gotta get outta here!
Let's go!

661
01:10:58,422 --> 01:11:00,507
It was you the whole time!

662
01:11:01,383 --> 01:11:04,470
Mumbai, Africa, Mexico. Everything!

663
01:11:05,012 --> 01:11:08,015
If you really wanted to know,
all you had to do was ask.

664
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:01,151
When you showed up in Paris,

665
01:12:02,653 --> 01:12:03,696
we knew you were a cop.

666
01:12:04,738 --> 01:12:06,073
Then why'd you let me in?

667
01:12:07,825 --> 01:12:10,244
Because I thought I could save you.

668
01:12:32,766 --> 01:12:34,226
That's when I lost control
of the motorcycle

669
01:12:34,393 --> 01:12:36,228
and crashed into the river.

670
01:12:37,604 --> 01:12:40,441
By the time I got back to the surface
and the riverbank,

671
01:12:42,651 --> 01:12:43,736
he was gone.

672
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:53,954
Your orders were
to investigate and report.

673
01:12:55,122 --> 01:12:57,458
So, now I got another situation.

674
01:12:58,584 --> 01:13:01,628
$100 million in gold ore
lost from Grauman Minerals,

675
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:04,423
which as you know,
is another multi-national

676
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,508
with American ties.

677
01:13:06,675 --> 01:13:10,888
And I got the Director on my ass
sending me here from D.C. to end this.

678
01:13:11,055 --> 01:13:12,639
So, my question...

679
01:13:14,058 --> 01:13:17,352
Why did you not follow
your instructions, son?

680
01:13:17,519 --> 01:13:19,146
I'd earned their trust, sir,
and I wanted to be sure

681
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:21,023
they were the suspects.

682
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:24,234
So, your M.O. is to help them
commit another crime?

683
01:13:24,568 --> 01:13:26,820
No! Not at all. I wanted to stop them.

684
01:13:26,987 --> 01:13:29,031
- Yeah...
- I tried to stop them.

685
01:13:30,115 --> 01:13:32,910
Bodhi doesn't see these as crimes.

686
01:13:33,077 --> 01:13:35,162
He thinks of them as offerings.

687
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:37,081
Offerings? What the hell does that mean?

688
01:13:37,331 --> 01:13:39,708
What the hell does that even mean?

689
01:13:40,084 --> 01:13:42,753
These guys are trying
to complete the Ozaki Eight.

690
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:45,756
They see that as a gift given to them
from the Earth.

691
01:13:45,923 --> 01:13:47,549
To balance out that gift,
they want to give back

692
01:13:47,716 --> 01:13:48,759
something taken from the Earth.

693
01:13:48,926 --> 01:13:51,326
This case, it was gold ore
that was ripped out of the ground.

694
01:13:54,264 --> 01:13:55,984
Now you've been undercover,
what, two weeks?

695
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:58,727
<i>You know how easy it is
to lose perspective, son?</i>

696
01:13:59,853 --> 01:14:03,398
What happened here,
you got too close to these individuals.

697
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:05,943
You did exactly what I told you not to do!

698
01:14:06,902 --> 01:14:10,197
I wanna catch these guys, sir.
Just like you.

699
01:14:11,406 --> 01:14:14,034
<i>But they're not common criminals.
They just don't see themselves that way.</i>

700
01:14:14,201 --> 01:14:16,036
<i>They've taken Ozaki's ideas
to the extreme.</i>

701
01:14:16,537 --> 01:14:19,331
They think they're crusaders
with a worthy cause.

702
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,640
They're more than willing to die for it.

703
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:25,587
Every criminal has some
bullshit justification for what they do.

704
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:28,090
<i>And just like every other
identified criminal,</i>

705
01:14:28,423 --> 01:14:30,843
their profiles are here at Interpol.

706
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:32,928
They will make a move,
and we will catch them.

707
01:14:33,637 --> 01:14:35,639
<i>We've frozen Al Fariq's assets.</i>

708
01:14:35,806 --> 01:14:36,932
<i>Their money is gone.</i>

709
01:14:37,099 --> 01:14:38,139
<i>These guys are meticulous.</i>

710
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:41,603
Everything they do is near flawless.

711
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,089
<i>But if we push them into a corner,</i>

712
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:46,650
<i>they will act like common criminals.</i>

713
01:14:48,235 --> 01:14:50,070
And it will get ugly.

714
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:55,701
Ugly is what we do, son.

715
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:00,622
- Sir?
- Yes?

716
01:15:00,956 --> 01:15:02,541
I think you should see this.

717
01:15:11,758 --> 01:15:13,594
Coming through frame any second...

718
01:15:14,011 --> 01:15:15,345
- There!
<i>- That's them.</i>

719
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,765
Bodhi's gonna finish what Ozaki started,
no matter what.

720
01:15:19,099 --> 01:15:20,559
<i>But he needs money to do that.</i>

721
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:24,104
We've frozen their assets.
They can't do a damn thing.

722
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:29,276
Hugh, how many banks are in the area?

723
01:15:29,776 --> 01:15:30,986
There's more than a dozen.

724
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,572
<i>But this is Saturday, none are open.</i>

725
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:36,658
Except a small branch
on top of the mountain.

726
01:15:36,825 --> 01:15:38,985
But no one would be crazy enough
to try anything there.

727
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:40,287
These guys would be.

728
01:15:43,081 --> 01:15:44,249
It's on top of a mountain.

729
01:15:45,167 --> 01:15:48,670
Only one road, up or down.
A total chokepoint.

730
01:15:48,837 --> 01:15:50,317
Chokepoint is exactly what they want.

731
01:15:51,048 --> 01:15:53,300
Alert local law enforcement.

732
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:58,305
It's time to choose whose side you're on.

733
01:16:09,149 --> 01:16:11,401
I'm not officially doin' this.

734
01:16:11,652 --> 01:16:14,529
I don't want you
dyin' on my watch, so don't.

735
01:16:49,147 --> 01:16:50,524
Bodhi!

736
01:16:52,234 --> 01:16:54,111
No! Hold your fire!

737
01:16:59,032 --> 01:17:00,450
<i>Hold your fire!</i>

738
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:08,727
Ah!

739
01:18:24,284 --> 01:18:25,285
Move!

740
01:18:25,827 --> 01:18:27,079
Cut 'im off!

741
01:18:52,020 --> 01:18:53,021
<i>Bodhi!</i>

742
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:30,559
Bodhi, no! No!

743
01:20:42,756 --> 01:20:44,591
That's one hell of a bucket list.

744
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:48,303
<i>Why isn't number four crossed off?</i>

745
01:20:48,637 --> 01:20:50,430
I thought he surfed the wave.

746
01:20:52,682 --> 01:20:54,768
He chose to save my life instead.

747
01:20:55,644 --> 01:20:56,645
Yeah.

748
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:01,066
Are you okay?

749
01:21:01,358 --> 01:21:02,943
Yeah.

750
01:21:03,693 --> 01:21:05,779
Nobody said it was gonna be an easy job.

751
01:21:11,660 --> 01:21:14,162
Oh, God.

752
01:23:10,904 --> 01:23:12,280
I know where he's goin'.

753
01:23:13,865 --> 01:23:17,243
The first six ordeals
all travel in one direction, down.

754
01:23:17,952 --> 01:23:19,079
<i>With gravity.</i>

755
01:23:19,496 --> 01:23:22,791
But Seven, "Master of Six Lives,"
asks you to go against gravity, go up.

756
01:23:24,084 --> 01:23:25,669
Free solo rock climbing.

757
01:23:26,294 --> 01:23:29,172
And no ropes, no protection,
no second chances.

758
01:23:30,465 --> 01:23:32,342
Now, there are just a handful
of ascents in the world

759
01:23:32,509 --> 01:23:34,052
that match Ozaki's standard
for the impossible,

760
01:23:34,219 --> 01:23:36,859
but only one that lies outside
of the reach of the U.S. government.

761
01:23:38,431 --> 01:23:40,183
Angel Falls, Venezuela.

762
01:23:44,771 --> 01:23:47,107
It's also the country
that Bodhi was born in.

763
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:49,442
Very smart.

764
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:50,610
Excuse me, sir. There is a call for you.

765
01:23:50,777 --> 01:23:52,028
I'll call him back.

766
01:23:52,195 --> 01:23:54,447
We have no diplomatic
relationships with Venezuela.

767
01:23:54,614 --> 01:23:57,325
We have no extradition treaty
with Venezuela.

768
01:23:58,702 --> 01:24:00,787
We get this son-of-a-bitch
when he pops up next.

769
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:02,288
<i>So, look,</i>

770
01:24:02,622 --> 01:24:05,875
if he survives this next ordeal,
he's got two left, correct?

771
01:24:06,543 --> 01:24:07,585
That's right, sir.

772
01:24:07,794 --> 01:24:11,339
But the wave like the one off France
is incredibly rare.

773
01:24:12,465 --> 01:24:15,510
It could be years until
there's a swell that size again.

774
01:24:15,677 --> 01:24:17,958
And the 8th Ordeal,
"Act of Ultimate Trust," is a mystery.

775
01:24:18,388 --> 01:24:19,472
<i>No one knows what it means.</i>

776
01:24:19,806 --> 01:24:22,475
I need to get to Bodhi in the 7th Ordeal
before he starts to climb.

777
01:24:22,642 --> 01:24:23,727
Otherwise he is gone.

778
01:24:24,853 --> 01:24:26,479
We can't even get into the country.

779
01:24:26,813 --> 01:24:28,773
I will not let this go, sir.

780
01:24:29,649 --> 01:24:31,317
Do you understand? He's out of reach.

781
01:24:35,739 --> 01:24:38,199
I make mistakes. Now, I know that.

782
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:41,327
But I promised you I could do this job.

783
01:24:42,954 --> 01:24:44,122
I need to finish it.

784
01:24:48,334 --> 01:24:49,878
Pap,

785
01:24:51,337 --> 01:24:52,464
can we get him in?

786
01:24:55,341 --> 01:24:56,551
Yeah, it could be done.

787
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,507
- Hey. This it?
<i>- Si.</i>

788
01:25:56,903 --> 01:25:59,906
Try not to get yourself killed, kid.

789
01:26:14,128 --> 01:26:15,380
<i>Bodhi, I can't see the line.</i>

790
01:26:16,673 --> 01:26:17,715
Nothing.

791
01:26:18,591 --> 01:26:19,592
I do.

792
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:23,847
I do see it, and it's beautiful.

793
01:26:26,724 --> 01:26:29,477
You know I always trusted you, right?

794
01:26:29,644 --> 01:26:32,480
To follow a line I can't even see?

795
01:26:33,606 --> 01:26:36,067
It's not my line. It's yours.

796
01:26:54,335 --> 01:26:55,670
<i>Bodhi!</i>

797
01:26:56,421 --> 01:26:57,672
It's over!

798
01:26:58,464 --> 01:27:00,216
Shit!

799
01:28:11,329 --> 01:28:12,330
Shit!

800
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:16,084
Shit!

801
01:28:19,128 --> 01:28:20,129
<i>Come on!</i>

802
01:28:20,463 --> 01:28:23,174
You can get it! Go for it!

803
01:28:28,221 --> 01:28:29,263
You can do it.

804
01:28:33,685 --> 01:28:35,687
<i>Hey, Grommet, come on.</i>

805
01:28:43,736 --> 01:28:44,821
See you soon.

806
01:28:55,415 --> 01:28:56,791
You've got nowhere to go!

807
01:30:56,786 --> 01:30:58,746
<i>Do you have any idea
how many laws you've broken?</i>

808
01:30:58,913 --> 01:31:00,039
<i>How many people you killed?</i>

809
01:31:02,375 --> 01:31:04,585
And you accomplished nothing.

810
01:31:06,420 --> 01:31:07,463
Maybe.

811
01:31:10,424 --> 01:31:11,968
But I'm not done yet.

812
01:31:13,719 --> 01:31:14,887
Bodhi! No!

813
01:31:15,596 --> 01:31:17,056
No!

814
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:13,196
No gear, no shoes, no body, nothin'.

815
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,490
Probably miles downriver by now.

816
01:32:16,991 --> 01:32:19,118
<i>Might never find the body.</i>

817
01:32:20,369 --> 01:32:21,746
"The Act of Ultimate Trust:"

818
01:32:22,747 --> 01:32:24,457
<i>Bodhi went over the falls on purpose.</i>

819
01:32:25,791 --> 01:32:27,335
"The 8th Ordeal."

820
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:29,587
<i>He figured it out.</i>

821
01:32:31,797 --> 01:32:33,633
Had it fast-tracked.

822
01:33:52,545 --> 01:33:54,422
I guess this is really
a small world, isn't it?

823
01:33:54,964 --> 01:33:57,004
I just knew if you were alive
anywhere on the Earth,

824
01:33:57,091 --> 01:33:58,509
there's no way you'd let this go.

825
01:33:58,884 --> 01:33:59,969
"Life of Water."

826
01:34:00,386 --> 01:34:02,471
<i>It's the last ordeal you need
to complete The Eight.</i>

827
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:05,224
Why are you here, Utah?

828
01:34:05,725 --> 01:34:08,561
It's 100-foot out there. More.

829
01:34:08,978 --> 01:34:10,021
You got no PFD.

830
01:34:10,396 --> 01:34:13,274
You're 150 miles from shore.
I'm here to take you in,

831
01:34:13,441 --> 01:34:15,943
because if you go out there,
you're not comin' back, Bodhi!

832
01:34:16,444 --> 01:34:18,487
And isn't that beautiful?

833
01:34:20,781 --> 01:34:22,992
Isn't that beautiful?

834
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:32,877
Isn't that beautiful, brother?

835
01:34:35,421 --> 01:34:37,131
This is my path.

836
01:34:39,759 --> 01:34:41,927
Let me complete it.

837
01:34:55,149 --> 01:34:56,400
See you soon, Utah.

838
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:31,388
<i>Where to?</i>

839
01:37:36,977 --> 01:37:38,771
Home.

840
01:37:39,305 --> 01:38:39,732
