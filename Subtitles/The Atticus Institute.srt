2
00:03:33,491 --> 00:03:35,412
Good.

3
00:03:39,717 --> 00:03:42,577
My dad had three kids.

4
00:03:43,622 --> 00:03:47,126
Me, my sister, and the institute.

5
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:50,345
That's just the way it was.
You knew that if you had a baseball game or,

6
00:03:50,445 --> 00:03:52,498
I don't know,
some sort of special event,

7
00:03:52,598 --> 00:03:55,228
there was always a good chance
he might not be there.

8
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:58,137
I mean, don't get me wrong,
he was there a good amount of the time.

9
00:03:58,237 --> 00:04:00,303
Just not all the time.

10
00:04:02,206 --> 00:04:06,643
I remember I tried to trick him
into thinking I had ESP.

11
00:04:06,745 --> 00:04:09,648
Or that I was moving stuff
around with my mind,

12
00:04:09,748 --> 00:04:12,798
hoping it might get him to pay
a little more attention.

13
00:04:12,898 --> 00:04:16,254
And he'd play along
for a few minutes, but...

14
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:19,655
then he'd leave for work.

15
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:23,228
I was four... when it happened.

16
00:04:23,328 --> 00:04:26,231
So I don't have too many memories
of my father.

17
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:29,101
I kinda remember
what it felt like to be with him.

18
00:04:29,808 --> 00:04:32,504
Talking with me, holding me.

19
00:04:32,904 --> 00:04:35,007
One thing I've always remembered
is this game we used to play

20
00:04:35,107 --> 00:04:37,576
on nights when he'd put me to bed.

21
00:04:37,676 --> 00:04:40,545
He'd ask all these questions
about animals.

22
00:04:40,645 --> 00:04:44,883
How many eyes does a fish have?
And I'd say, "Two."

23
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:50,082
How many noses does a monkey have?
How many ears does a gopher have?

24
00:04:50,482 --> 00:04:52,190
That's really all there was to it.

25
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,891
I remember thinking it was fun.

26
00:04:57,628 --> 00:05:01,166
We got married in 1965.

27
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:04,150
I wanted children right away,
but Henry wanted to wait.

28
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:07,539
'Cause it was about that time
that he was starting the institute.

29
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:11,843
And then he had a different
research lab job

30
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:14,913
at the same time so we could make rent.

31
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:18,648
He worked a lot.
Even after we had both kids.

32
00:05:19,784 --> 00:05:21,723
But he loved it.

33
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:23,855
You know?

34
00:05:23,955 --> 00:05:27,023
A man has the right to love his work.

35
00:05:34,098 --> 00:05:37,536
Our goal was to conduct unbiased,
empirical research

36
00:05:37,636 --> 00:05:40,405
on exceptional human abilities.

37
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,741
Psychokinesis, ESP, precognition.

38
00:05:42,841 --> 00:05:47,379
Things that are typically considered
fringe science or parapsychology.

39
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:51,650
Dr. West, and the rest of us,
quite frankly,

40
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:56,052
all believed that there was real science
to be discovered in these areas.

41
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,093
We had a good time doing
what we were doing.

42
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:02,828
We were underfunded, of course,

43
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:05,163
but we were still relatively young,
so it didn't matter.

44
00:06:05,263 --> 00:06:07,753
In the first few years alone,

45
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:11,703
we published close
to 30 journal articles between us.

46
00:06:12,403 --> 00:06:14,606
And there were some
truly exceptional cases.

47
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:17,640
All documented.

48
00:06:20,945 --> 00:06:23,482
Well, we did a lot of different
kinds of tests, but...

49
00:06:24,282 --> 00:06:28,353
probably the most effective one
to measure clairvoyant abilities

50
00:06:28,453 --> 00:06:30,455
were the Zener cards.

51
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:32,221
This one?

52
00:06:34,558 --> 00:06:37,526
It's the lines. The wavy lines.

53
00:06:37,895 --> 00:06:39,932
Well, if you select each card at random,

54
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,568
then the success ratio
will be close to 20%.

55
00:06:43,668 --> 00:06:49,941
But we had several subjects
whose ratio was closer to 30%.

56
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:52,144
And that might not seem like very much,

57
00:06:52,244 --> 00:06:57,382
but if you realize that we
did each test over 200 times,

58
00:06:57,482 --> 00:07:02,351
you begin to understand
the virtual impossibility of that figure.

59
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:09,761
I think we were all secretly
hoping to discover the next Nina Kulagina.

60
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:13,865
She was a woman
from the former Soviet Union.

61
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:16,275
Truly remarkable.

62
00:07:17,301 --> 00:07:21,072
Nina's psychokinetic abilities were
probably the most well-documented

63
00:07:21,172 --> 00:07:24,673
and they stood up
to the strictest of scrutiny.

64
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:30,311
The closest we encountered
to that level was Norman LeClair.

65
00:07:30,411 --> 00:07:31,683
French-Canadian man.

66
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:37,353
Norman's PK abilities
were astounding at times.

67
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:47,766
That's how it works. Pretty simple?

68
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,234
Yeah.

69
00:07:49,933 --> 00:07:52,034
Try to vibrate the game board.

70
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,981
It's all right. Take your time.

71
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:15,024
That's all right. You gave it your best shot.
We can try again later.

72
00:08:18,863 --> 00:08:20,823
Dr. West brought in colleagues,

73
00:08:20,923 --> 00:08:25,036
some well-known and esteemed
researchers at the time,

74
00:08:25,447 --> 00:08:29,474
to observe Norman.
All the necessary steps were taken

75
00:08:29,874 --> 00:08:33,912
to prevent any claims of researcher bias
or improper testing methods.

76
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:39,551
All outside variables were controlled,
for this was to be the moment the snickering,

77
00:08:39,651 --> 00:08:43,522
the talking behind hands
would finally stop.

78
00:08:43,622 --> 00:08:46,022
This was proof.

79
00:08:58,736 --> 00:09:02,207
- God, I can't believe that.
- Explain that.

80
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:05,341
- As we said.
- How do you explain that one?

81
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,707
How do you explain that?

82
00:09:35,807 --> 00:09:38,143
- What do you guys think?
- Oh, my God.

83
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:41,880
Oh, they were clearly impressed.
Even though, I'd have to say,

84
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,916
they didn't really allow themselves
to show it.

85
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:47,285
I was happy. I was happy for Henry.

86
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:50,756
He had worked so hard for that moment.

87
00:09:51,656 --> 00:09:56,225
But then, just before
the researchers left...

88
00:09:56,527 --> 00:10:00,357
one of them noticed something odd
on the wristwatch

89
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:04,736
of one of our research assistants.
And it turned out that this watch

90
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:09,441
had been rigged with a small
neodymium magnet.

91
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:14,746
And every one of our tests
involved metal in some capacity.

92
00:10:14,846 --> 00:10:18,481
Even the trace amounts of iron
in the cereal.

93
00:10:19,984 --> 00:10:23,922
And this guy had been complicit
with Norman's ruse right from the start.

94
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:26,858
Right under our noses. It was...

95
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:29,561
it was a crushing blow.

96
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:32,197
For the institute's credibility

97
00:10:32,297 --> 00:10:34,866
and for Henry's reputation.

98
00:10:34,966 --> 00:10:37,766
It was... it was awful.

99
00:10:49,746 --> 00:10:51,607
Is there...

100
00:10:52,229 --> 00:10:55,338
something else we should know about?

101
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:58,554
Judith? With you?

102
00:11:06,597 --> 00:11:08,665
It's like...

103
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:14,870
it's like being in a well sometimes.

104
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:21,210
I can see it, I can hear it,
but nobody knows I'm there.

105
00:11:28,252 --> 00:11:31,187
I'd... I'd like to help you.

106
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,423
Whatever is going on.

107
00:11:36,326 --> 00:11:38,897
Judith was first brought
to the institute

108
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:42,700
in September of 1976 by her sister...

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,405
sister Margaret. She had been reading
about the work we were doing

110
00:11:47,505 --> 00:11:49,307
in a small magazine or something.

111
00:11:49,407 --> 00:11:53,311
And she thought we would be interested
in testing Judith.

112
00:11:53,411 --> 00:11:56,114
The first thing she did
when she walked in

113
00:11:56,214 --> 00:11:58,483
was she told me it was my birthday.

114
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:01,820
Which caught me a bit off guard.

115
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,522
Not because it was my birthday.
It wasn't, it was the day before.

116
00:12:05,622 --> 00:12:07,458
Maybe it was a guess.

117
00:12:07,558 --> 00:12:11,963
You see, that's something you always have
to guard against with the work we did.

118
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:14,666
Lucky guesses. False positives.

119
00:12:14,766 --> 00:12:19,604
If you let yourself fall victim
to a belief bias of any kind,

120
00:12:19,704 --> 00:12:23,374
that's when you start forcing
the pieces together.

121
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:25,975
Even when they don't fit at all.

122
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:31,309
Judith...

123
00:12:32,016 --> 00:12:35,420
she seemed average.
She's in her early 40s.

124
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,122
Can't say there's anything particularly
remarkable about her appearance.

125
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:42,560
She was kind of the type of person that you
would pass by on the street in any town.

126
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:45,595
You might say hello, smile,
but that's about it.

127
00:12:47,631 --> 00:12:50,335
You would have no idea

128
00:12:50,535 --> 00:12:52,801
that Judith was what she was.

129
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:02,614
I was older than her by seven years.

130
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:05,316
She was a silly kid.

131
00:13:06,586 --> 00:13:08,746
And we had a lot of fun.

132
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:13,391
There was one day, she was around 35,

133
00:13:13,921 --> 00:13:18,128
she slipped on a patch of ice
on the sidewalk

134
00:13:18,228 --> 00:13:21,029
and hurt her back pretty badly.

135
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:26,036
And after that,
she had a little trouble moving,

136
00:13:26,168 --> 00:13:28,230
and getting around.

137
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,243
And her pain was consistent.

138
00:13:32,789 --> 00:13:34,245
It was chronic.

139
00:13:35,293 --> 00:13:37,482
It was enough
that my husband and I decided

140
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:39,851
that she shouldn't be
living alone anymore.

141
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,423
So she moved in with us and the kids.

142
00:13:43,554 --> 00:13:48,793
About a year after Judith moved in,
she began to withdraw.

143
00:13:48,893 --> 00:13:52,197
I mean, she would stay
in her room for days.

144
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:55,166
I'm not sure she would even eat.

145
00:13:55,766 --> 00:13:59,301
I don't know what she did
when she was alone.

146
00:13:59,436 --> 00:14:04,008
She was reading some very unusual books.

147
00:14:04,108 --> 00:14:08,055
And that's when it all started.
And I knew things weren't right.

148
00:14:08,713 --> 00:14:10,845
There were things...

149
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,585
there were things that I saw her do

150
00:14:14,686 --> 00:14:16,755
that I just...

151
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:19,915
I had to do something.

152
00:14:22,192 --> 00:14:27,463
And to this day, part of me still regrets
doing what I did, but I had to.

153
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:35,506
But Dr. West was intrigued with Judith
almost immediately. We all were.

154
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:38,409
By this point, we'd researched
hundreds of cases,

155
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:41,477
brought in almost as many
subjects into the lab.

156
00:14:44,147 --> 00:14:45,581
Judith was different, though.

157
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:50,185
We just had no idea
how different at this point.

158
00:15:00,891 --> 00:15:03,030
Can you tell us your name, please?

159
00:15:03,856 --> 00:15:07,371
- Judith Winstead.
- And what's your date of birth, Judith?

160
00:15:07,643 --> 00:15:10,008
February 18th, 1935.

161
00:15:10,108 --> 00:15:12,786
And your marital status?

162
00:15:12,886 --> 00:15:16,318
- I'm not married.
- Have you ever been?

163
00:15:16,818 --> 00:15:19,345
Okay. How many siblings do you have?

164
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:23,919
- One.
- Are your parents still alive?

165
00:15:26,957 --> 00:15:28,793
- Judith, are your parents still alive?
- No.

166
00:15:28,893 --> 00:15:32,494
Okay. Are you right-handed
or left-handed?

167
00:15:32,896 --> 00:15:37,001
Judith's behavior was always odd.
Even from the first day she arrived.

168
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,405
But in our field, it wasn't uncommon
to encounter odd people.

169
00:15:40,505 --> 00:15:42,471
So we didn't give it much thought.

170
00:15:44,341 --> 00:15:46,377
Ms. Winstead?

171
00:15:47,266 --> 00:15:49,071
Right-handed.

172
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,617
And when did you first realize
you had certain abilities?

173
00:15:58,462 --> 00:16:00,658
Are you... are you all right, dear?

174
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,400
You're bleeding.

175
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,274
Oh, my God.

176
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,833
- Here's some...
- Give her some towels.

177
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,769
Oh, tilt your head back, okay?

178
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:13,738
It's not her nose, it's her hand.
Her hand is bleeding.

179
00:16:13,838 --> 00:16:17,606
What? Did you... did you bite yourself?

180
00:16:19,576 --> 00:16:21,279
Why?

181
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:24,382
Susan, let's get her...
get her to the ladies' room, please.

182
00:16:24,482 --> 00:16:26,451
As long as you're okay with it.

183
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:30,353
- That's all right. Just take...
- Just take care of her.

184
00:16:32,522 --> 00:16:34,025
Judith?

185
00:16:34,825 --> 00:16:37,295
What is she... no, no, no.
What is she doing? Stop.

186
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,431
- Just stop. Calm down.
- Let go.

187
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:42,200
Ms. Winstead. Judith, stop, please.

188
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,981
Well, for starters,
Judith came to us in an unusual way.

189
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:50,141
Most times, we learn of someone
and seek them out.

190
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,441
We had no idea Judith
was even out there.

191
00:16:54,711 --> 00:16:59,748
Nevertheless, she tested beyond
what any of us thought was even possible.

192
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:03,855
There was no measure.

193
00:17:04,155 --> 00:17:07,656
Truly no measure for her abilities.

194
00:17:09,459 --> 00:17:12,928
If you can, try for seven this time.
Any combination.

195
00:17:15,053 --> 00:17:16,591
Three and four.

196
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:20,238
One and six.

197
00:17:21,887 --> 00:17:23,773
Three and four.

198
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,885
One and six.

199
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:31,514
Two and five.

200
00:17:33,649 --> 00:17:36,152
Judith, what I'd like you to try to do
is to move the wheel

201
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,487
without actually touching it.

202
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:45,160
Try to concentrate your mind.
Focus your thoughts.

203
00:17:52,135 --> 00:17:54,605
She outperformed every subject
we'd ever studied.

204
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:57,573
There was no comparison to be made.

205
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:03,477
I understand how peculiar it might seem
to hear her abilities described in this way,

206
00:18:03,577 --> 00:18:06,233
but they were godlike.

207
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:16,024
Okay, Judith, what do you see this time?

208
00:18:18,594 --> 00:18:21,002
- Judith?
- Star.

209
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,501
- And this time.
- Square.

210
00:18:29,288 --> 00:18:31,408
And what do you see this time?

211
00:18:34,578 --> 00:18:36,180
Judith, are you all right?

212
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:40,148
Are you all right, Judith? Do you...
can we continue with the exercise?

213
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:42,720
- I think she's...
- Judith?

214
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:46,621
I think she's okay. All right,
let's resume. Judith, what...

215
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,292
- The card bent.
- What?

216
00:18:51,661 --> 00:18:54,063
- That card bent. We're taking a break.
- What do you mean?

217
00:18:55,265 --> 00:18:56,999
Dr. West?

218
00:19:01,418 --> 00:19:03,105
Looking back, I...

219
00:19:04,207 --> 00:19:06,474
I guess I should've known better.

220
00:19:07,177 --> 00:19:09,752
I mean, yes, we'd seen...

221
00:19:09,852 --> 00:19:13,448
witnessed amazing things in the past.

222
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,586
But nothing like that.
Nothing, nothing like that.

223
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:23,694
Inverse square law.
Conservation of momentum.

224
00:19:23,794 --> 00:19:27,899
These were well-established laws
of physics that were being violated.

225
00:19:27,999 --> 00:19:31,342
The second law of thermodynamics.
All of these.

226
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,083
We should've been scared.

227
00:19:34,237 --> 00:19:37,005
Someone with that much power would...

228
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,939
but we were too excited to be scared.

229
00:19:40,039 --> 00:19:42,413
We finally had the proof...

230
00:19:42,713 --> 00:19:46,982
not another hoax...
that we'd been seeking for years.

231
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:51,587
We had our Nina Kulagina.

232
00:20:01,731 --> 00:20:04,368
What I remember, she was due to...

233
00:20:04,468 --> 00:20:07,238
stay overnight in the lab
through the weekend.

234
00:20:07,338 --> 00:20:10,708
We did this quite often with subjects
because anomalous events

235
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:13,744
sometimes occur
during the deep-sleep cycle.

236
00:20:14,044 --> 00:20:18,981
And we monitored the subjects through
the night using various recording devices.

237
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:29,293
During Judith's first overnight, we only had
one staff member present. Kenneth.

238
00:20:30,154 --> 00:20:33,030
I don't ever think I knew his last name.

239
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:36,667
He was a graduate student
at the time. Nice, quiet kid.

240
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,435
Came from a farming family.
I remember that because so do I.

241
00:20:41,771 --> 00:20:43,282
He was...

242
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,278
he was alone with Judith that night
sitting not far from her bed.

243
00:20:47,878 --> 00:20:50,548
I don't even think he knew
that he was being recorded

244
00:20:50,648 --> 00:20:55,450
because you can see him smoking which
he wasn't supposed to be doing in the lab.

245
00:20:56,786 --> 00:20:58,987
Nothing happened for hours.

246
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:02,484
Nobody ever found out what happened.

247
00:22:04,053 --> 00:22:05,854
But whatever did...

248
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:09,393
that was it for him.

249
00:22:09,593 --> 00:22:11,384
Never came back.

250
00:22:34,117 --> 00:22:38,255
We tried contacting
Judith's sister, Margaret.

251
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:40,455
We couldn't reach her.

252
00:22:40,990 --> 00:22:43,027
She'd disconnected her phone.

253
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:46,631
It became clear at that moment...

254
00:22:46,731 --> 00:22:49,464
that Margaret had abandoned her.

255
00:22:51,568 --> 00:22:53,371
The decision now was
what we were gonna do.

256
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,673
I could tell that Lawrence was already
reaching a bit of a breaking point.

257
00:22:55,773 --> 00:22:57,501
It was obvious.

258
00:22:58,842 --> 00:23:00,909
It wasn't so obvious with Dr. West.

259
00:23:02,145 --> 00:23:03,912
Not to me anyway.

260
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,415
We simply made the decision that we were
going to continue our testing with her.

261
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:15,066
But after that night,

262
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,366
it became extremely difficult.

263
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:21,732
It was so unnerving.

264
00:23:22,032 --> 00:23:25,722
Her behavior. It was so incredibly...

265
00:23:26,737 --> 00:23:32,006
She... she would say things
and do things that made you...

266
00:23:32,542 --> 00:23:35,413
She would scream in that voice.

267
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:37,275
Grab her!

268
00:23:38,748 --> 00:23:40,606
It wasn't hers.

269
00:23:41,006 --> 00:23:42,981
It was like an animal.

270
00:23:44,821 --> 00:23:47,191
Henry seemed most affected by it.

271
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:50,995
He tried his best to shield
the others from that.

272
00:23:51,293 --> 00:23:53,910
I knew him well enough to know that

273
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:56,731
he was deeply affected.

274
00:24:00,269 --> 00:24:02,070
I watched my father change firsthand.

275
00:24:03,306 --> 00:24:06,610
And I have no doubt whatsoever
that what happened in that lab

276
00:24:06,769 --> 00:24:08,846
caused that change.

277
00:24:09,855 --> 00:24:13,751
I remember being
in the seventh grade years later,

278
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:16,418
and other kids making fun of me.

279
00:24:17,487 --> 00:24:21,089
Call him crazy. They'd say I'd be crazy.

280
00:24:22,826 --> 00:24:26,330
Back then, it was different
than it is now.

281
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,133
Now everyone has a therapist.

282
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:33,037
They go for anything...
stubbed toe. But back then,

283
00:24:33,337 --> 00:24:36,805
you went if it was something bad.

284
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:44,982
And especially if medication
was involved.

285
00:24:45,082 --> 00:24:47,682
And in my husband's case, it was.

286
00:24:52,595 --> 00:24:56,126
- Why do you say that, Henry?
- You don't understand.

287
00:24:56,226 --> 00:24:57,730
Okay.

288
00:24:58,635 --> 00:25:01,697
- I see what's happening.
- At work?

289
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,836
I can't help you if you don't tell me

290
00:25:05,936 --> 00:25:08,536
- what you think is happening.
- I can't tell you.

291
00:25:10,139 --> 00:25:12,545
What are you so afraid of, Henry?

292
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:21,051
I know it's very trying,

293
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:23,854
but we would really like to continue.

294
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,089
- Can you please stop that, Judith?
- Can you please stop that, please?

295
00:25:29,792 --> 00:25:31,996
We'd really like to continue...

296
00:25:32,596 --> 00:25:35,940
We had about 10 different
degrees between us.

297
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,736
Including one in medicine,
three in psychology.

298
00:25:40,108 --> 00:25:42,140
And we knew...

299
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,174
that was not normal.

300
00:25:48,278 --> 00:25:50,948
Judith was not a typical test subject.

301
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:54,018
She had made that
abundantly clear by that point.

302
00:25:55,146 --> 00:25:58,554
And I felt we needed help.

303
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,499
I received a file from another analyst.

304
00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:10,934
It was something he thought
I should take a look at.

305
00:26:11,034 --> 00:26:15,072
We started a program
to investigate psi in the early '70s.

306
00:26:15,172 --> 00:26:20,242
Psi-related phenomenon. About five years
after KGB conducted similar studies.

307
00:26:22,545 --> 00:26:25,816
I didn't have the highest
expectations going in.

308
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:28,652
I felt we'd already been down that road.

309
00:26:28,752 --> 00:26:31,642
And it proved to be a waste
of time and money.

310
00:26:31,742 --> 00:26:35,156
But Marcus was a friend
of a friend, and so I went.

311
00:26:36,993 --> 00:26:39,294
It's difficult to explain.

312
00:26:41,230 --> 00:26:44,032
But you could feel something...

313
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:49,404
a weight, an invisible weight.

314
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,310
The whole lab took on that feeling

315
00:26:53,410 --> 00:26:55,577
the minute he stepped through the door.

316
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:02,052
It was if he represented a challenge
to her, to her power.

317
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:05,189
Everything we had seen
up until that point,

318
00:27:05,289 --> 00:27:08,092
everything Judith had done,
everything we'd witnessed,

319
00:27:08,992 --> 00:27:12,763
it barely compared
to what happened after he arrived.

320
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:16,266
I assumed they'd run through
the usual battery of psi tests.

321
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:20,437
The cards, the elaborate devices
with the numbers, but they didn't.

322
00:27:20,937 --> 00:27:24,505
They told me that those tests
weren't right for her.

323
00:27:27,955 --> 00:27:29,680
This here's a way to convince anyone.

324
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:34,816
Easiest and simplest way
to begin the demonstration.

325
00:27:57,073 --> 00:27:59,710
Now you understand
why we've called you in here.

326
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:02,246
That can't be accounted for

327
00:28:02,346 --> 00:28:06,549
through any known rational explanation.

328
00:28:06,649 --> 00:28:09,053
And she's able to repeat it
with a variety of different materials.

329
00:28:09,153 --> 00:28:11,286
Breaking the third law
of thermal dynamics.

330
00:28:19,362 --> 00:28:24,434
By the time the man from the Defense
Intelligence Agency, Robert Koepp, arrived,

331
00:28:24,534 --> 00:28:26,437
we'd given up on our standard
testing procedure.

332
00:28:27,634 --> 00:28:29,637
Well, we'd simply talked to her.

333
00:28:32,241 --> 00:28:34,409
It was so difficult.

334
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:37,946
She knew...

335
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:42,050
too much.

336
00:28:43,886 --> 00:28:45,322
Think of any object.

337
00:28:45,422 --> 00:28:47,391
- Something in the room?
- No, it doesn't have to be.

338
00:28:47,491 --> 00:28:49,159
No, let's make it something
not in the room.

339
00:28:49,259 --> 00:28:51,693
- Okay.
- Okay.

340
00:28:53,196 --> 00:28:54,663
Draw what you see, please.

341
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:15,417
- And what object were you thinking of?
- A hammer.

342
00:29:22,658 --> 00:29:25,128
- Excuse me.
- Susan?

343
00:29:25,228 --> 00:29:27,631
- Susan.
- Henry, she...

344
00:29:28,431 --> 00:29:29,700
You don't frighten me!

345
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,169
- You don't fucking know!
- Susan! Stop it!

346
00:29:32,269 --> 00:29:34,472
- What are you doing?!
- Marcus!

347
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:36,207
- Susan, calm down.
- How dare you?!

348
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,108
- You don't know anything!
- Take her outside, please.

349
00:29:38,208 --> 00:29:40,244
Just take her outside.

350
00:29:40,644 --> 00:29:42,044
She had drawn a shamrock.

351
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:47,251
Back in 1973, three years earlier,

352
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:50,370
I had traveled back to London
for my mum's funeral.

353
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,310
I was devastated.

354
00:29:56,458 --> 00:29:58,862
Her family had immigrated
to London from Ireland

355
00:29:58,962 --> 00:30:02,597
and she was very proud
of her Irish heritage.

356
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:06,603
And in her casket, she had worn
the same brooch that she'd worn

357
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:09,337
almost every day of her life.

358
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,551
It was a shamrock.

359
00:30:14,511 --> 00:30:16,601
As soon as I saw that picture,

360
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:19,680
I realized what Judith
had whispered to me.

361
00:30:20,783 --> 00:30:23,351
"You weren't there."

362
00:30:24,921 --> 00:30:27,390
Which is true, I wasn't.

363
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,992
My mother died the day
before I made it home.

364
00:30:33,029 --> 00:30:35,132
And that woman...

365
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:38,613
that thing somehow knew that.

366
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:42,003
And how much guilt.

367
00:30:43,472 --> 00:30:45,075
She wanted me to behave that way.

368
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,442
She wanted me to react that way.

369
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:50,681
To humiliate me in front of my peers

370
00:30:50,781 --> 00:30:54,615
by turning me into everything
I had tried so hard not to be.

371
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:05,062
Well, the incident with Susan
was very unsettling

372
00:31:05,162 --> 00:31:08,855
because it demonstrated
Judith's ability to influence us.

373
00:31:08,955 --> 00:31:11,301
She was definitely influencing Henry.

374
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:15,038
He started to pull back.
Which was unlike him.

375
00:31:15,138 --> 00:31:18,308
I thought he was gonna fight
the government's involvement,

376
00:31:18,508 --> 00:31:20,195
but that didn't happen.

377
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:23,745
He withdrew and they took over.

378
00:31:46,769 --> 00:31:48,513
My arm!

379
00:31:49,972 --> 00:31:51,329
Use the strap right there.

380
00:31:51,429 --> 00:31:54,342
Please, step back.
You're gonna break her arm.

381
00:31:57,313 --> 00:31:58,914
- Please, step back.
- What are you giving her?

382
00:32:05,488 --> 00:32:07,055
Tell Robert.

383
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:42,790
Heartbeat's back again. Mark it.
14 minutes and 27 seconds.

384
00:32:44,427 --> 00:32:49,166
- Any physical deterioration?
- Nothing. Jesus.

385
00:32:49,566 --> 00:32:51,935
She's pissing again. Get the towels.

386
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:54,269
It's over there. Get it.

387
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,329
- No.
- That's good. Thank you.

388
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:02,243
Step back.

389
00:33:07,216 --> 00:33:08,883
Check her! Make sure she's all right!

390
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,568
Not that, that.

391
00:33:13,822 --> 00:33:16,617
Once they witnessed
the things we'd all seen,

392
00:33:16,717 --> 00:33:18,617
it became a very different scenario.

393
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:23,333
It didn't matter what my preconceived
notions were before visiting the institute.

394
00:33:23,433 --> 00:33:26,336
What mattered now was national security.

395
00:33:26,936 --> 00:33:28,605
We left nothing to chance.

396
00:33:28,705 --> 00:33:33,009
All evidence was thoroughly reviewed
by top Defense Department analysts.

397
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:36,746
Tissue samples were extracted.
Blood samples taken.

398
00:33:36,846 --> 00:33:39,883
Plans were immediately
put in place to contain the situation.

399
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:41,485
The institute was locked down.

400
00:33:42,085 --> 00:33:46,056
We assumed control of all testing
and information collection.

401
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:48,825
Strict security protocols
were put in place.

402
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:51,194
This was a coordinated military effort

403
00:33:51,294 --> 00:33:54,197
with support from the highest levels
of the government.

404
00:33:54,697 --> 00:33:59,369
Soldiers were stationed around the clock
inside the lab, all of them armed.

405
00:34:00,286 --> 00:34:03,106
We were there because we believed it.

406
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:05,373
Now we wanted to see it.

407
00:34:07,376 --> 00:34:09,079
The camera's ready.

408
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,246
- Lights ready.
- Flashing.

409
00:34:30,365 --> 00:34:33,003
I think he's having a seizure. Henry?

410
00:34:33,103 --> 00:34:35,238
- Get a hand under his head.
- Turn the lights on.

411
00:34:35,338 --> 00:34:38,208
- Keep his mouth open.
- Turn the lights on!

412
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:40,642
Where is she?

413
00:34:45,715 --> 00:34:47,315
Stop the flashing now!

414
00:34:51,486 --> 00:34:53,790
The DIA report prompted swift action.

415
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:57,928
We looked at the evidence, we reviewed
the footage of the seizure incident.

416
00:34:58,128 --> 00:35:01,898
Dr. West had no history of epilepsy
or any related condition,

417
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:05,769
so it's highly unlikely that the flashing
lights could've triggered it.

418
00:35:06,328 --> 00:35:11,576
We could not say definitively that
Ms. Winstead caused the seizure,

419
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:14,244
but we certainly couldn't
rule it out either.

420
00:35:15,063 --> 00:35:19,096
Several meetings were held to discuss
the seriousness of this threat.

421
00:35:19,548 --> 00:35:23,469
I can't speak to the specifics
of what was discussed,

422
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:26,464
but suffice it to say
if you're gonna inform the White House

423
00:35:26,564 --> 00:35:30,591
of something as crazy as this,
you better be damn sure it's true.

424
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:38,735
All psychological and pharmacological
explanations were ruled out.

425
00:35:38,835 --> 00:35:43,206
Her blood samples came back
with impossibly high electrolyte levels.

426
00:35:43,506 --> 00:35:48,511
A completely unknown molecular compound

427
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:50,978
was found in her tissue.

428
00:35:51,847 --> 00:35:53,883
Something was inside her.

429
00:35:53,983 --> 00:35:55,954
No doubt about that.

430
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:58,578
Not a disease.

431
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:00,557
Not a parasite.

432
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:02,757
An evil.

433
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:20,408
Do you think you know
what caused the seizure?

434
00:36:22,311 --> 00:36:24,747
- Henry?
- Yes.

435
00:36:24,847 --> 00:36:27,417
- Are you taking the new medication?
- It has nothing to do with that.

436
00:36:27,517 --> 00:36:31,422
- Henry, it is important that you keep...
- I am taking it.

437
00:36:32,522 --> 00:36:35,122
I'm seeing things at night.

438
00:36:36,958 --> 00:36:40,930
I can't stop thinking about everything.

439
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,330
I try, but...

440
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,969
And even when I'm with
my family, I feel it.

441
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:52,740
I'm afraid.

442
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:57,478
I'm afraid of what might happen to them.

443
00:36:59,047 --> 00:37:01,382
But, yes, I am taking
the new medication.

444
00:37:04,586 --> 00:37:09,693
The story was that when the KGB
learned about Nina Kulagina's ability,

445
00:37:09,793 --> 00:37:14,598
they performed a test with a living frog.
This was back in 1970.

446
00:37:14,998 --> 00:37:18,702
The Soviets wanted to see
if Nina could telekinetically affect

447
00:37:18,802 --> 00:37:22,072
the bioelectrical impulses
in living tissue.

448
00:37:22,172 --> 00:37:25,008
To speed up and slow down its heartbeat.

449
00:37:25,208 --> 00:37:27,911
And allegedly, she did.

450
00:37:28,711 --> 00:37:33,381
So our government wanted to see if they
could replicate those results with Judith.

451
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:23,731
Good God.

452
00:38:25,534 --> 00:38:27,019
Jesus.

453
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:34,042
- Why's he barking?
- It's her. She's still doing it.

454
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:44,486
She's doing it to the dog. No, her!

455
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,357
Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights!

456
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:53,954
Where is she?

457
00:38:54,963 --> 00:38:58,168
Secure this room now. Right now!

458
00:38:59,268 --> 00:39:02,005
- Quiet. Quiet.
- Turn on the lights!

459
00:39:02,105 --> 00:39:05,239
Quiet! Everyone, quiet.

460
00:39:09,286 --> 00:39:11,012
Don't move.

461
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:20,743
- Robert, what's happening?
- Take it down.

462
00:39:20,843 --> 00:39:24,125
Quiet. Quiet.

463
00:39:28,864 --> 00:39:30,634
Marcus.

464
00:39:33,236 --> 00:39:35,172
- Nobody move. Nobody move.
- Who's touching me?

465
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,954
Turn on the light!
Turn on the light now.

466
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:38,640
- Turn it on.
- Turn that light back on.

467
00:39:47,783 --> 00:39:49,283
Grab her!

468
00:40:18,614 --> 00:40:21,217
Imagine being 22, 23 years old,

469
00:40:21,317 --> 00:40:24,352
best shape of your life,
armed to the teeth.

470
00:40:25,821 --> 00:40:27,418
And you scared of some lady looked like

471
00:40:27,518 --> 00:40:30,018
she could've been
your primary school teacher.

472
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:33,627
That's what was going on then.

473
00:40:34,596 --> 00:40:36,480
You understand?

474
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,834
Things took a significant
turn after that.

475
00:40:41,703 --> 00:40:44,207
I think in total, there were...

476
00:40:44,307 --> 00:40:48,678
six or seven unexplainable
incidents that occurred.

477
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:51,212
All outside the institute.

478
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:56,019
One of the government researcher's
cousins almost died in a car wreck.

479
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:59,422
There was... a soldier's father
was attacked by a dog.

480
00:40:59,522 --> 00:41:02,325
There was a house fire,
if I remember correctly.

481
00:41:02,425 --> 00:41:05,159
And on and on it went.

482
00:41:05,894 --> 00:41:08,031
Now, each of these things
on their own could be a coincidence,

483
00:41:08,131 --> 00:41:10,333
but the likelihood that all of them
would happen together

484
00:41:10,433 --> 00:41:15,739
to the family and friends of this same group
of people in the same span of time

485
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,641
is astonishingly low.

486
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:23,077
My son Jeffrey started
waking up night after night

487
00:41:23,177 --> 00:41:25,648
screaming with night terrors.

488
00:41:25,748 --> 00:41:28,384
My wife and I found out that

489
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:31,421
that was common among toddlers.

490
00:41:32,421 --> 00:41:34,228
I don't know.

491
00:41:34,328 --> 00:41:39,126
I don't know if it is or not.
It was... it was so eerie.

492
00:41:41,763 --> 00:41:43,471
I just...

493
00:41:46,968 --> 00:41:51,104
I was starting to think that maybe
my work was following me home.

494
00:41:51,873 --> 00:41:54,711
I felt bad for Sarge.

495
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:57,947
His father got bit up
real bad by some stray.

496
00:41:58,047 --> 00:42:00,086
Pit bull, I think.

497
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,354
And let me tell ya,

498
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,727
she knew.

499
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,489
The day after that,
she kept staring at him.

500
00:42:09,725 --> 00:42:12,462
He hadn't told any one of us.

501
00:42:12,562 --> 00:42:15,364
Nobody knew for about another week.

502
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:16,666
But she knew.

503
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:21,835
The whole time, she knew.

504
00:42:25,874 --> 00:42:28,475
It was late one night in the lab.

505
00:42:30,745 --> 00:42:33,794
And I happened to notice
a paper clip on the floor

506
00:42:33,894 --> 00:42:37,551
inside the air lock portion
of Judith's enclosure.

507
00:42:38,687 --> 00:42:42,125
Now, that environment was meticulously kept.
It was nearly sterile.

508
00:42:42,225 --> 00:42:46,060
So there was no explaining
how it got there.

509
00:42:48,597 --> 00:42:50,117
Anyway...

510
00:42:51,167 --> 00:42:55,705
I picked it up, I stuffed it in my pocket
and didn't give it another thought.

511
00:42:56,005 --> 00:43:00,242
We were at my sister's house
for my nephew's birthday.

512
00:43:00,935 --> 00:43:04,511
My wife and I never had kids,
so Matthew was very dear to us.

513
00:43:06,948 --> 00:43:09,385
And I remember reaching for my keys

514
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:12,381
and thinking I heard something
fall onto the ground

515
00:43:12,481 --> 00:43:14,487
from my pocket.

516
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:21,162
It was the paper clip.

517
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:30,440
Burt, knock it off.

518
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,078
- Claire, it's Matt!
- What?!

519
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,332
Matthew!

520
00:43:34,434 --> 00:43:36,379
Oh, my God!

521
00:43:36,579 --> 00:43:38,081
Matthew? Matthew?

522
00:43:38,181 --> 00:43:40,748
- Oh, my God! Sweetheart!
- He's not breathing!

523
00:43:44,252 --> 00:43:46,916
He'd stuck it in a wall socket.

524
00:43:49,558 --> 00:43:52,562
I could've worn any other pants that day,
but I wore those.

525
00:43:52,662 --> 00:43:55,796
And that paper clip just happened
to be what he found?

526
00:43:57,365 --> 00:44:00,069
Out of all the things in the world,
a balled-up receipt, a stick of bubble gum...

527
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:03,973
that's what happened to fall out
of my pocket at that moment?

528
00:44:04,673 --> 00:44:06,843
Not at any point
in the five days before that?

529
00:44:06,943 --> 00:44:10,680
Not... not anywhere else?
Not in... not in the hamper?

530
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,819
In the washing machine?
In the dryer? There?

531
00:44:13,919 --> 00:44:16,449
On his birthday?

532
00:44:18,486 --> 00:44:21,988
And the way the dog was barking,
it was... it was... it was like...

533
00:44:25,794 --> 00:44:27,974
What happened...

534
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:30,384
was no accident.

535
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:36,670
That was it. I'd had enough.

536
00:44:37,539 --> 00:44:40,183
It was 10 years until I heard
from Lawrence again.

537
00:44:40,283 --> 00:44:43,810
He and his wife moved out of the country
shortly after it happened.

538
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:49,150
I was surprised he didn't leave
the institute sooner than he did.

539
00:44:50,585 --> 00:44:53,153
It was a shame
what happened to his nephew.

540
00:44:55,924 --> 00:44:58,759
I don't think Lawrence
ever really forgave himself.

541
00:45:00,395 --> 00:45:04,266
Well, we couldn't discount the events
that happened outside the institute.

542
00:45:04,366 --> 00:45:07,124
Too much happened
for it to be coincidence.

543
00:45:07,224 --> 00:45:10,570
But what it did do is make us
rethink our strategy.

544
00:45:15,010 --> 00:45:17,512
What are we gonna use to immobilize her?

545
00:45:17,612 --> 00:45:18,748
Fentanyl.

546
00:45:18,848 --> 00:45:21,951
The gas derivative of it should
knock her out in seconds.

547
00:45:22,051 --> 00:45:24,120
It could also kill her.

548
00:45:24,829 --> 00:45:28,524
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
- Hey. You can't keep her in there.

549
00:45:28,624 --> 00:45:32,228
- Now's not the time for compassion.
- She's a human being.

550
00:45:32,328 --> 00:45:34,764
There are laws against
that sort of treatment for a reason.

551
00:45:34,864 --> 00:45:36,633
Who do you think makes those laws?

552
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,302
- This is my lab.
- No, not anymore it's not.

553
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:41,300
I have sat back and kept quiet...

554
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:44,738
- while I've seen you...
- And you'd do well to stay quiet.

555
00:45:49,645 --> 00:45:51,480
Get him outta here.

556
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,950
I never should've called you people.

557
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:55,783
Hold on.

558
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:01,688
You really think
you're equipped to handle this?

559
00:46:03,658 --> 00:46:07,928
Your little lab here with your flash cards
and ESP machines?

560
00:46:12,367 --> 00:46:14,001
See it...

561
00:46:23,111 --> 00:46:25,145
but then it's gone.

562
00:46:28,116 --> 00:46:30,580
Now it comes back. You can...

563
00:46:31,251 --> 00:46:33,569
see that in the rest of the pictures.

564
00:46:37,092 --> 00:46:39,460
For those few moments...

565
00:46:41,529 --> 00:46:43,497
it wasn't in the room.

566
00:46:45,633 --> 00:46:48,001
Might not even been in the building.

567
00:46:51,506 --> 00:46:53,940
Do you understand what I'm telling you?

568
00:46:56,177 --> 00:47:01,214
We don't control this,
it's not just us who will be at risk.

569
00:47:04,686 --> 00:47:07,223
And if you do control it,

570
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:09,656
then who will be at risk?

571
00:47:24,339 --> 00:47:29,910
We recognized the danger of allowing it
to remain even remotely unrestricted.

572
00:47:31,746 --> 00:47:34,383
It was immensely powerful.

573
00:47:34,783 --> 00:47:38,257
And rather than continually
try to explain it,

574
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:42,188
the decision was made
to attempt to harness it.

575
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:50,158
Repeat the following:

576
00:47:50,258 --> 00:47:53,767
one, two, three, four, five.

577
00:47:57,772 --> 00:48:01,577
Your instructions are clear.
Repeat the following:

578
00:48:01,677 --> 00:48:05,282
one, two, three, four, five.

579
00:48:10,318 --> 00:48:12,533
You will cooperate.

580
00:48:20,315 --> 00:48:21,809
Now,

581
00:48:21,909 --> 00:48:26,391
this is a map divided into a grid
consisting of five sections.

582
00:48:26,491 --> 00:48:29,405
One, two, three, four, five.

583
00:48:29,505 --> 00:48:33,843
I want you to listen carefully
and concentrate.

584
00:48:34,469 --> 00:48:38,016
There are artillery and biological
weapons being stored

585
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:42,451
somewhere in this region.
Look at the grid

586
00:48:42,551 --> 00:48:46,119
and tell me the number of where.

587
00:48:50,025 --> 00:48:53,493
Tell me where they're being stored.

588
00:48:56,998 --> 00:49:00,734
You will cooperate. Put it away.

589
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:12,006
Part of me...
will always feel responsible.

590
00:49:13,281 --> 00:49:16,716
Because it was my idea
to notify the military.

591
00:49:19,654 --> 00:49:23,436
I don't know what we would've
done otherwise. But...

592
00:49:24,136 --> 00:49:28,110
I do wonder if Henry
might still be alive today if...

593
00:49:28,610 --> 00:49:30,863
I had settled on a more...

594
00:49:32,467 --> 00:49:36,169
reasonable solution.

595
00:49:42,317 --> 00:49:44,078
Sergeant.

596
00:49:46,914 --> 00:49:48,747
Do you hear me?

597
00:49:50,518 --> 00:49:52,050
Ms. Winstead,

598
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:57,791
your instructions are to make
Sergeant Parella say exactly the following:

599
00:49:58,426 --> 00:50:01,405
reposition all nuclear submarines

600
00:50:01,505 --> 00:50:03,726
out of the Baltic Sea.

601
00:50:04,537 --> 00:50:06,402
Once again,

602
00:50:06,502 --> 00:50:09,690
reposition all nuclear submarines

603
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,564
out of the Baltic Sea.

604
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:22,449
Your instructions are clear.

605
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:41,005
- How many eyes does a fish have?
- Turn up his volume.

606
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,801
How many ears does a gopher have?

607
00:50:43,901 --> 00:50:46,374
How many noses does a monkey have?

608
00:50:46,474 --> 00:50:49,110
How many arms does a whale have?

609
00:50:49,210 --> 00:50:51,446
How many hoofs does a horse have?

610
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,849
- How many noses does a monkey have?
- Dr. West?

611
00:50:53,949 --> 00:50:56,085
- How many stripes does a zebra have?
- Dr. West.

612
00:50:56,185 --> 00:50:58,354
How many eyes does a fish have?

613
00:50:58,454 --> 00:51:00,623
How many ears does an elephant have?

614
00:51:00,723 --> 00:51:03,332
How many stripes does a zebra have?

615
00:51:03,592 --> 00:51:06,059
How many eyes does a fish have?

616
00:51:06,594 --> 00:51:08,264
- How many eyes does a fish have?
- Henry.

617
00:51:09,820 --> 00:51:12,285
- How many noses does a monkey have?
- Dr. West.

618
00:51:12,385 --> 00:51:15,004
How many noses does a monkey have?

619
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:17,839
How many noses does a monkey have?

620
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:20,454
How many noses does a monkey have?

621
00:51:20,554 --> 00:51:24,144
How many noses does a monkey have?
How many noses...

622
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:29,257
You can't control something like that.

623
00:51:30,486 --> 00:51:34,521
I don't care who you are,
how many weapons you have.

624
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,957
All those things that went on...

625
00:51:41,196 --> 00:51:43,933
you don't get to play games
with the Devil.

626
00:51:44,033 --> 00:51:47,233
And if you do, you damn sure
don't get to make the rules.

627
00:51:50,805 --> 00:51:52,975
That type of evil...

628
00:51:53,464 --> 00:51:55,586
just thinking about it,

629
00:51:55,686 --> 00:51:57,786
talking about it.

630
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,550
Even you people making this movie...

631
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:04,053
and the people watching it...

632
00:52:04,532 --> 00:52:06,755
you're inviting

633
00:52:07,043 --> 00:52:10,123
bad things into your life.

634
00:52:14,115 --> 00:52:16,129
Too late for me.

635
00:52:17,098 --> 00:52:19,511
All the things I've seen.

636
00:52:26,701 --> 00:52:30,713
This wasn't like the books or the movies
or false accounts you hear about.

637
00:52:31,013 --> 00:52:34,984
If those cases were legitimate,
I can assure you, we would've intervened.

638
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:39,555
This is real.
There was no speculative data.

639
00:52:39,655 --> 00:52:42,645
There was no charlatans
looking to make a buck.

640
00:52:42,745 --> 00:52:47,827
This was the only governmentally
confirmed case of possession.

641
00:52:48,696 --> 00:52:52,968
Arguably the most significant thing we learned
was that it had an intelligence.

642
00:52:53,068 --> 00:52:57,773
That meant that it was able to conduct
some form of cost-benefit analysis.

643
00:52:57,873 --> 00:53:01,377
Our plan was to utilize
its ability to reason

644
00:53:01,477 --> 00:53:04,914
as a stopgap measure to clear
a psychological pathway.

645
00:53:05,314 --> 00:53:09,919
So they essentially offered it a choice
between cooperating or suffering.

646
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:13,419
But it was a false choice
because both options

647
00:53:13,519 --> 00:53:16,091
caused Judith to suffer.

648
00:53:16,191 --> 00:53:20,658
Their belief was that if they
could control her physical body,

649
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:22,809
chiefly her mind,

650
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:26,532
they could control
how the force manifested.

651
00:53:27,302 --> 00:53:30,137
Possess the possession

652
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:32,105
is what they would say.

653
00:53:33,675 --> 00:53:36,242
As if it was gonna work that way.

654
00:53:38,981 --> 00:53:40,745
Clear, go again.

655
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:16,435
They pushed that poor woman
to her limits.

656
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:19,855
Judith Winstead, the person.

657
00:54:20,186 --> 00:54:23,389
I felt... terrible for her.

658
00:54:23,991 --> 00:54:26,226
But there was nothing
we could do to help her.

659
00:54:35,437 --> 00:54:37,940
Please, stop.

660
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,675
Please, stop.

661
00:54:39,775 --> 00:54:44,012
We were eventually able to devise
a method of governing the force.

662
00:54:44,412 --> 00:54:48,584
Once we controlled her,
we could effectively control it.

663
00:54:48,684 --> 00:54:50,652
Once that happened,

664
00:54:50,752 --> 00:54:54,021
the nature of our involvement
changed dramatically.

665
00:55:52,647 --> 00:55:54,409
It was...

666
00:55:54,975 --> 00:55:56,612
shocking.

667
00:55:57,885 --> 00:56:00,465
But it wasn't at the same time.

668
00:56:00,788 --> 00:56:03,156
We knew something was coming.

669
00:56:05,559 --> 00:56:08,227
I mean, a few nights before that, I...

670
00:56:09,797 --> 00:56:13,866
found him curled up in a ball
under the bathroom sink.

671
00:56:15,002 --> 00:56:17,740
Talking to himself.

672
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,075
Crying.

673
00:56:20,748 --> 00:56:23,379
I mean, he was scared to death.

674
00:56:25,930 --> 00:56:28,550
Henry was nearing the end of his rope.

675
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:32,755
After a while, he rarely even
set foot in the lab.

676
00:56:33,055 --> 00:56:36,825
He would lock himself in the office
for hours at a time.

677
00:56:36,925 --> 00:56:40,593
Sometimes you could hear him
muttering from behind the door.

678
00:56:41,929 --> 00:56:44,471
Things were reaching a tipping point.

679
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:49,004
I do. I do believe that it drove
Dr. West to that.

680
00:56:49,370 --> 00:56:53,242
Trust me. We did a complete
background check. We knew everything.

681
00:56:53,542 --> 00:56:56,442
We knew about the therapy,
the medication.

682
00:56:57,812 --> 00:57:00,880
What happened was not
a product of psychosis.

683
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:09,355
Maybe you should take
some time away from work.

684
00:57:10,391 --> 00:57:12,628
Henry? Maybe take some time off?

685
00:57:12,728 --> 00:57:14,596
It doesn't matter where I am.
It's everywhere.

686
00:57:14,696 --> 00:57:17,699
It's like a shadow.
Except it's not mine.

687
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:19,968
So you feel like it's following you,
the shadow.

688
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:22,337
I feel like it's already caught me.

689
00:57:22,551 --> 00:57:26,101
To be totally honest, Henry,
I find a lot of this very troubling.

690
00:57:26,201 --> 00:57:27,810
Is that why you're using that?

691
00:57:27,910 --> 00:57:30,946
- Yeah, we always record the sessions.
- Not on a camera.

692
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:33,582
Well, I... things seem different.

693
00:57:33,682 --> 00:57:36,484
- Did they make you do this?
- Did who?

694
00:57:36,584 --> 00:57:39,495
- Is this to make sure I don't say anything?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

695
00:57:39,595 --> 00:57:44,257
They're pushing it too far. They want
to control everything, but they can't.

696
00:57:44,357 --> 00:57:47,695
It's too powerful. It's too strong.

697
00:57:47,795 --> 00:57:49,498
Take it easy, Henry.

698
00:57:49,598 --> 00:57:53,567
I'm trying to make you understand.
There's something happening.

699
00:57:57,471 --> 00:57:59,875
- To you?
- Yes.

700
00:58:01,155 --> 00:58:04,179
To me, then maybe to you,
then maybe to them.

701
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:06,546
Whoever it chooses.

702
00:58:07,882 --> 00:58:12,018
There's no science left in the world
for this, but they think there is.

703
00:58:14,388 --> 00:58:16,658
It doesn't even matter anymore
what I say.

704
00:58:16,758 --> 00:58:19,494
It's gonna speak for itself.
So use your goddamn camera.

705
00:58:19,594 --> 00:58:22,531
Write my name.
Write my words across the sky.

706
00:58:22,631 --> 00:58:25,331
I don't give a damn because if it...

707
00:58:25,983 --> 00:58:29,035
if they keep pushing it
the way they are...

708
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:06,907
Nod if you can hear me.

709
00:59:11,281 --> 00:59:12,681
Good.

710
00:59:12,781 --> 00:59:16,652
What I want you to do now is focus
on the person on the television.

711
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:18,785
Nod if you understand.

712
00:59:23,357 --> 00:59:25,458
I want you to tell me his name.

713
00:59:30,481 --> 00:59:32,067
Your instructions are clear.

714
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:35,235
Tell me the name of the person
you see on the television.

715
00:59:40,808 --> 00:59:42,534
Alan.

716
00:59:42,934 --> 00:59:44,607
Turcott.

717
00:59:51,252 --> 00:59:54,587
Next, I want you to tell me
his current location.

718
00:59:55,890 --> 00:59:56,813
Hanscom.

719
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:03,229
Office. Military office.

720
01:00:13,107 --> 01:00:14,941
Let's get them on the phone.

721
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:24,694
- Tell them we're gonna try it out.
- We're gonna try it out.

722
01:00:29,189 --> 01:00:30,525
They're ready.

723
01:00:30,625 --> 01:00:33,294
Listen very carefully
to what I'm gonna tell you.

724
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:37,999
What I want you to do now is attempt
to influence Private Turcott's breathing.

725
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:39,265
Begin.

726
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:51,210
Your instructions are clear.

727
01:01:15,237 --> 01:01:16,738
- Tell her to stop it.
- Stop it.

728
01:01:16,838 --> 01:01:18,473
- Tell her to stop!
- Stop.

729
01:01:19,174 --> 01:01:20,642
I said stop!

730
01:01:21,626 --> 01:01:22,943
Hit her!

731
01:01:35,222 --> 01:01:37,259
We eventually figured out
what was going on.

732
01:01:37,359 --> 01:01:40,028
And we felt so foolish
for not having recognized

733
01:01:40,128 --> 01:01:43,731
that that was the government's
intention from the beginning.

734
01:01:44,020 --> 01:01:45,955
To weaponize her.

735
01:01:46,155 --> 01:01:49,771
Having the ability
to remotely collect intel.

736
01:01:50,171 --> 01:01:52,240
To be able to read
the minds of foreign leaders

737
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:55,477
to know exactly
what their plan of attack is.

738
01:01:55,777 --> 01:01:58,947
Where they were and what they were
thinking at any given moment.

739
01:01:59,347 --> 01:02:01,951
And, if necessary,

740
01:02:02,651 --> 01:02:06,588
be able to collapse their lungs
and stop their hearts.

741
01:02:06,888 --> 01:02:09,724
All from thousands of miles away.

742
01:02:09,824 --> 01:02:11,927
We were looking at the future
of clandestine warfare.

743
01:02:12,027 --> 01:02:15,030
Where attacks could be as strategic

744
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:18,033
and as untraceable as we saw fit.

745
01:02:18,133 --> 01:02:21,036
The rigors of their testing protocol
increased enormously.

746
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:24,339
The more they pushed,
the more defiant she became.

747
01:02:24,439 --> 01:02:27,974
Well, it became.

748
01:03:03,610 --> 01:03:07,716
We treated her like the discovery
of any new destructive force.

749
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:10,588
Much of what we did mirrored
the testing procedures

750
01:03:10,688 --> 01:03:13,388
used in the early atomic testing.

751
01:03:13,488 --> 01:03:17,891
We needed to understand this power
if we were intent on utilizing it.

752
01:03:32,139 --> 01:03:33,640
What are you?

753
01:03:44,652 --> 01:03:46,386
How do you choose your host?

754
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:58,366
Now.

755
01:04:11,668 --> 01:04:13,715
Tell me your name.

756
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:29,899
They were getting very frustrated

757
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:33,234
because everything she said
sounded like gibberish.

758
01:04:33,534 --> 01:04:34,936
They kept shocking her.

759
01:04:35,236 --> 01:04:37,439
When she didn't give them the answer
they wanted, they'd shock her again.

760
01:04:37,539 --> 01:04:39,674
They'd up the voltage
and shock her again.

761
01:04:40,574 --> 01:04:43,361
Our analysts were eventually
able to isolate

762
01:04:43,461 --> 01:04:46,751
certain elements of Judith's speech.

763
01:04:47,794 --> 01:04:51,184
Turned out she hadn't been
speaking gibberish at all.

764
01:05:07,968 --> 01:05:09,120
What are you?

765
01:05:14,307 --> 01:05:16,476
How do you choose your host?

766
01:05:22,283 --> 01:05:24,758
This will all be over soon.

767
01:05:30,624 --> 01:05:35,266
It just proved that she was
in control the entire time.

768
01:05:35,366 --> 01:05:38,600
Just drawing us in.
Drawing us in closer.

769
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:44,259
And instead of stopping like we all knew
we should, we kept going.

770
01:05:44,906 --> 01:05:49,477
We were too close to something
truly revolutionary to stop.

771
01:05:49,577 --> 01:05:54,282
It was affecting everyone, but that's
the nature of any struggle, any battle.

772
01:05:54,382 --> 01:05:57,318
Push and you will be resisted.

773
01:05:57,418 --> 01:06:00,689
That's why you want to be
the one pushing the hardest.

774
01:06:01,129 --> 01:06:04,636
You would hear them discussing new ideas
and strategies, disruption techniques,

775
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:07,629
but nobody would talk
about what was obvious.

776
01:06:07,929 --> 01:06:12,207
That there are certain things in this world
that we will never understand.

777
01:06:12,307 --> 01:06:14,767
And Judith Winstead was one of them.

778
01:06:20,607 --> 01:06:26,321
It was acutely averse to all things
related to religion.

779
01:06:26,421 --> 01:06:29,248
Even more than it was to electroshock.

780
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:35,357
And that poor priest...

781
01:06:36,125 --> 01:06:38,527
he was just a pawn.

782
01:06:39,127 --> 01:06:41,596
We were very much against
involving the Church.

783
01:06:41,896 --> 01:06:44,032
We didn't want to turn this
into a sideshow.

784
01:06:44,432 --> 01:06:48,434
At the same time,
we had to gain control somehow.

785
01:06:51,151 --> 01:06:52,905
This one, too.

786
01:07:01,048 --> 01:07:03,082
Thumbprint on that one as well.

787
01:07:15,429 --> 01:07:17,933
- Do you understand everything?
- I do, yes.

788
01:07:18,033 --> 01:07:20,166
Into the camera, please.

789
01:07:21,035 --> 01:07:23,071
I understand.

790
01:07:23,471 --> 01:07:24,994
Okay.

791
01:07:41,989 --> 01:07:44,392
Do you have any questions?

792
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,158
No.

793
01:07:49,630 --> 01:07:51,164
Good.

794
01:07:56,303 --> 01:07:58,885
That last night in the lab was...

795
01:07:58,985 --> 01:08:01,008
it was crazy.

796
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:04,212
They told us to double up
on our ammo just to stay safe.

797
01:08:04,312 --> 01:08:08,948
There was a big buildup. Everyone was
mentally preparing for what might happen.

798
01:08:11,218 --> 01:08:15,190
We needed to get it out of the lab
and we couldn't do that with a civilian.

799
01:08:15,590 --> 01:08:18,324
We had to transfer it
into one of our own.

800
01:08:21,962 --> 01:08:26,432
When I arrived at the lab that night
and found out what was going to happen...

801
01:08:28,602 --> 01:08:30,369
I froze.

802
01:08:32,372 --> 01:08:36,441
I wanted to scream for them
not to try that.

803
01:08:37,644 --> 01:08:39,814
But I didn't say a word.

804
01:08:40,314 --> 01:08:42,950
I wanted to get out of there real bad.

805
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:45,733
I remember, I wanted
to sneak out the back door

806
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:48,887
when nobody was looking and just go.

807
01:08:53,226 --> 01:08:55,340
And of course I couldn't.

808
01:08:57,831 --> 01:08:59,765
I should've.

809
01:10:10,588 --> 01:10:13,121
- Go ahead.
- Copy that.

810
01:10:13,859 --> 01:10:15,398
Get ready, Corporal.

811
01:10:58,185 --> 01:11:00,019
Hey, hey, hey.

812
01:11:19,673 --> 01:11:20,840
Stop the transfer.

813
01:11:24,945 --> 01:11:28,347
The power of the blood
of Jesus commands you!

814
01:11:28,815 --> 01:11:30,452
Bow to the Lord!

815
01:11:31,352 --> 01:11:32,387
Get him out of there.

816
01:11:32,487 --> 01:11:35,387
- Hit the gas. Hit the gas.
- Help! Help!

817
01:11:58,645 --> 01:11:59,580
Pull him out!

818
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,581
Pull him out. Make sure he's okay.

819
01:12:03,250 --> 01:12:05,384
Are you okay?

820
01:12:07,187 --> 01:12:09,989
- I'm gonna clear it.
- No. No, no, no. Hold on.

821
01:12:15,395 --> 01:12:18,964
- Did it work? Did it work?
- I... I don't know.

822
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:23,569
Give her a quick charge.

823
01:12:26,673 --> 01:12:28,309
She's still out.

824
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:31,577
No, no. The electrodes
got disconnected. See?

825
01:12:36,116 --> 01:12:38,384
Shit.

826
01:12:50,130 --> 01:12:51,766
- Are you positive she's unconscious?
- No.

827
01:12:51,866 --> 01:12:53,935
- Can we gas her again?
- It might be too much.

828
01:12:54,035 --> 01:12:55,503
Well, I'm not going in there
unless I know she's completely...

829
01:12:55,603 --> 01:12:58,373
- Then don't go in there.
- If we don't get those electrodes...

830
01:12:58,473 --> 01:12:59,766
- Are you crazy?
- We've got nothing if it's dead.

831
01:12:59,866 --> 01:13:02,077
- Hit her again! Now!
- I'm not gonna hit her again.

832
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,377
- Hit her again!
- Don't...

833
01:13:07,247 --> 01:13:09,048
Robert, don't.

834
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:37,770
Bilateral?

835
01:14:39,172 --> 01:14:40,806
Bi-frontal.

836
01:15:44,337 --> 01:15:46,241
What are you doing? What are you doing?
You need to step back.

837
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:48,075
I'm gonna check him.
I'm gonna check his pulse.

838
01:15:48,175 --> 01:15:49,341
- That's it?
- That's all.

839
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:00,019
Let's start clearing again...

840
01:16:16,186 --> 01:16:19,004
Get him outta here. Let's go.
Come on. Let's go.

841
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:25,712
The situation was a disaster
in all possible ways.

842
01:16:25,812 --> 01:16:29,116
Local law enforcement
got involved, the media.

843
01:16:29,216 --> 01:16:31,359
They all wanted to know
what happened, naturally.

844
01:16:31,459 --> 01:16:33,761
They had a right to the story.

845
01:16:33,861 --> 01:16:36,090
Just not to all of it.

846
01:16:36,190 --> 01:16:39,940
I'm still not at liberty to discuss
much more than I have.

847
01:16:40,340 --> 01:16:43,831
Especially as it pertains to the events
that took place after that night.

848
01:16:43,931 --> 01:16:46,567
But I can tell you this...

849
01:16:46,667 --> 01:16:50,602
the measures taken were done with the best
interests of this country in mind.

850
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,444
It wasn't until fairly recently

851
01:16:56,544 --> 01:17:00,948
that I found out
what happened to my sister.

852
01:17:01,448 --> 01:17:05,252
And as horrible as it probably sounds,

853
01:17:05,352 --> 01:17:07,382
I preferred it that way.

854
01:17:07,482 --> 01:17:10,658
She was a good person. She was.

855
01:17:11,058 --> 01:17:13,258
But people change.

856
01:17:14,444 --> 01:17:16,161
Even good people.

857
01:17:18,538 --> 01:17:21,635
I know that the official story
was that he was crazy.

858
01:17:21,735 --> 01:17:25,087
He was a mad scientist
who had finally lost

859
01:17:25,187 --> 01:17:28,854
the last of his widely
scattered marbles.

860
01:17:30,043 --> 01:17:32,513
But believe me when I tell you,

861
01:17:33,013 --> 01:17:36,948
Henry West was not crazy.

862
01:17:38,951 --> 01:17:41,119
Which I suppose...

863
01:17:42,188 --> 01:17:45,886
leaves us
with the alternate explanation.

864
01:17:59,839 --> 01:18:01,940
What is this?

865
01:18:34,157 --> 01:18:36,008
Please, help.

866
01:18:37,305 --> 01:19:37,453
