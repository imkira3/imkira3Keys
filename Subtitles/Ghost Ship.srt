Ghost Ship
horror,2002

4
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,006
I can't hold her much longer.
She's taking on too much water.

5
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:44,803
- What is going on back there?
- Keep your pants on, Murphy.

6
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,560
We blew the starboard engine.
Port engine's way too hot.

7
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,730
- Hold on.
- Shorten the tow or cut her loose.

8
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,898
Epps...

9
00:05:56,148 --> 00:06:00,027
<i>... get off my damn tugboat.
We don't have much time.</i>

10
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:05,991
<i>Move it, Epps. If she sinks,
she's taking us with her.</i>

11
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,624
Got a punch in the port floater.

12
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,793
<i>- Five minutes before she floods.
- Less than that!</i>

13
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:19,505
Get back here.
We're cutting her loose.

14
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:22,257
- Cut her loose.
- That's it. Get back here.

15
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,218
Come on! You heard the man!

16
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:30,390
Took us three months to get her off
the bottom. I will not lose her now!

17
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:33,519
Goddamn it, Epps!
You can't fix everything!

18
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,730
Christ!

19
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:47,032
<i>- For the last time, get back here!
- She's taking on too much water!</i>

20
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:53,997
<i>Why do you always have to break
my balls? I said get back here!</i>

21
00:06:55,874 --> 00:07:02,714
<i>Do you want me to come down there
and kick your ass? Because I'll do it.</i>

22
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:11,098
Here's to the best damn
salvage crew in the business!

23
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:14,810
- We did it, guys!
- Yeah, look at that!

24
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,398
All right. Nice work.

25
00:07:19,398 --> 00:07:24,444
- Here's to the fucking sea!
- To the sea.

26
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,491
To a job well done.

27
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,538
Mr. Murphy? I'm Jack Ferriman. I was
wondering if I could buy you a drink.

28
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:38,375
He doesn't drink.

29
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:43,589
Could I talk to you alone?

30
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:49,136
You talk to me, you talk to my crew.
That's the way it is.

31
00:07:49,428 --> 00:07:53,891
I fly the Arctic Weather Patrol flights
out of Mackenzie Bay.

32
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:59,646
Last month I was out in the middle
of the Strait when I came across this.

33
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,317
Congratulations. You found a boat.

34
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,820
In the middle of the ocean,
of all places.

35
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,157
I tried for radio contact
and got nothing...

36
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,368
...so I figured she had to be adrift.

37
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,120
In the Bering Strait?

38
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:18,707
That's miles from shipping lanes.
Did you alert the Coast Guard?

39
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:22,920
It's international waters,
so they noted it and that's it.

40
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,546
You get a name?

41
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:29,134
No, I put it out of my head until
two days ago when I saw it again.

42
00:08:29,384 --> 00:08:32,721
What are we talking about?
What kind of tonnage?

43
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:37,017
Big. Huge.
Could be military.

44
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:40,896
Let's say that we're
a little bit interested.

45
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:43,398
What's in it for you?

46
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:47,402
I want 20% finder's fee,
whatever she's worth.

47
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:53,534
- Have you told anyone else about this?
- Not a living soul.

48
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:59,289
- Give us a minute, will you?
- Okay.

49
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,209
So? What do you think, Murph?

50
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:05,295
Who knows? Could be full of shit.

51
00:09:05,546 --> 00:09:09,758
I do know one thing. I've seen strange
things happen in the Strait.

52
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:14,054
I know something else:
Sea gives you an opportunity, take it.

53
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:19,268
That's at least a week out of our way.
We've been out for six months already.

54
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:23,814
I got a fiancée waiting, remember?
I'm getting married in a month.

55
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,193
Plan was to go back to Anchorage.
Starboard diesel needs an overhaul.

56
00:09:28,443 --> 00:09:32,781
- In our business, the only plan is:
- There is no plan.

57
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:38,120
If you don't want to go, that's fine.
Let's tell him we'll get somebody else.

58
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:44,459
Wait a minute. Let's not be hasty.
What's a ship like that worth?

59
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,794
Who knows?

60
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:50,632
Millions? Thousands? Could be nothing.
Depends on a lot of things.

61
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:54,636
- Mainly, if we have the right to salvage.
- Pretty big "if".

62
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:58,640
- What's the split?
- We split it even, six ways.

63
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,352
- Even split?
- Beats me paying you overtime.

64
00:10:02,603 --> 00:10:05,439
I'm good.

65
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:08,734
I'm in.

66
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,862
Greer? What do you say?

67
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,990
All right.

68
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:21,246
Hey, Ferriman! Can you come over here?

69
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:28,128
So this is the way it works.
10% instead of your 20% finder's fee.

70
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:34,468
I can't let you take advantage of me
like that.

71
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:39,056
That's the way it is.
Take it or leave it.

72
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:47,940
Fine. But I go with you.

73
00:10:48,065 --> 00:10:50,275
Not on my boat, you don't.

74
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:54,571
Think I'd tell you where a fortune
might be without insurance?

75
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:58,200
There are five other boats
that would jump at this.

76
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:02,996
I come with you.
So you take it or leave it.

77
00:11:33,944 --> 00:11:36,530
Things are dull!

78
00:11:38,866 --> 00:11:41,743
She'll love it. What do you think?

79
00:11:41,994 --> 00:11:46,415
Too much off the sides, but I can
come up with something she'll love.

80
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,835
- Shave that yourself.
- Don't want to help me out?

81
00:11:50,085 --> 00:11:56,717
Who the fuck are you kidding? Everybody
knows you Navy boys take it up the ass.

82
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:19,239
- Enjoying the ride, Jack?
- No, sir.

83
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:35,172
Not the same as flying planes
over ice sheets, is it?

84
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:38,717
- What's the appeal?
- I could ask you the same thing.

85
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:43,514
What's a nice girl doing in a dump
like this instead of raising a family?

86
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:47,351
I own a third of Murphy's operation.
I'm not that nice.

87
00:12:47,601 --> 00:12:51,605
And these monkeys are my family.

88
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,150
<i>Santos to Murphy. Come in.</i>

89
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,906
- Yeah?
- I think you should get up here.

90
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:05,619
<i>- What is it?
- I think you should see this!</i>

91
00:13:06,787 --> 00:13:10,207
It was there a second ago!
Ten miles to the northwest.

92
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:14,086
Would you turn off that fucking music?

93
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,881
I'm telling you, there must be a glitch.
I saw it with my own eyes.

94
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:23,387
- Glitch, my ass. There's nothing there.
- Give me a look at this.

95
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:29,434
There it is! Right in front of you!
Tell me you don't see nothing.

96
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:34,731
Do you see what I'm saying?
Do you see what I'm saying to you?

97
00:13:34,982 --> 00:13:41,530
<i>- Dodge, could you get on the bow light?
- All right, Murph.</i>

98
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:49,371
- It's there, right?
- There's something there.

99
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,506
Hey, Murph, what's up?

100
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:03,427
<i>Vessel at position 7-5 north...</i>

101
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:06,805
...this is "Arctic Warrior".

102
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:09,766
<i>Come in.</i>

103
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:15,731
This is tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Do you read me?

104
00:14:16,106 --> 00:14:18,108
This is "Arctic Warrior".

105
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:21,570
<i>Do you read me? Come in.</i>

106
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,467
Shit!

107
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:12,913
- Now do you believe me?
- Holy shit!

108
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:18,252
An ocean liner?
Where did that come from?

109
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:28,262
It's the "Antonia Graza".

110
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:31,306
Jesus Christ.

111
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:35,936
<i>This is civilian tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Is there anyone aboard?</i>

112
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:40,148
<i>This is civilian tugboat "Arctic Warrior".
Is there anyone aboard?</i>

113
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,654
This is "Arctic Warrior".
Can you read us?

114
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:52,411
- You know her, Murphy?
- Only in my dreams.

115
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:01,420
Christ, she's beautiful.

116
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:08,677
Italian liners couldn't compete for speed,
so they built floating art palaces instead.

117
00:16:08,927 --> 00:16:13,807
She was reported missing May 21,
1962, off the coast of Labrador.

118
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:19,438
Funny thing is, there was no distress
signal. She just disappeared.

119
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:26,361
Ever since, every captain's been looking
for her, hoping she hasn't gone down.

120
00:16:26,653 --> 00:16:29,531
- Do you know what this means?
- What?

121
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:34,912
Under the law of the sea, she's ours.
Let's not keep a lady waiting.

122
00:16:35,162 --> 00:16:40,209
Santos, bring us alongside. Fire up
the crane. We got business to do.

123
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:46,006
When we get onboard, stay together. We
don't know what kind of shape she's in.

124
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:49,968
<i>- Take us up, Greer.
- Aye, aye, captain.</i>

125
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:56,600
Hey, Murphy, please remember to keep
all channels open. Thank you.

126
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:01,146
They won't let me go.

127
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:05,526
Safety first.
That's why you go last, Jack.

128
00:17:05,776 --> 00:17:08,570
Can you sit down?
I'm trying to keep this steady.

129
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,907
- I just want...
- Sit down! Get out of the way!

130
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,952
Okay.

131
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:20,666
She's had some battering over
the last 40 years, you can tell.

132
00:17:20,916 --> 00:17:24,795
<i>Stand by. Setting you down topside.</i>

133
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:28,423
She's still a beaut.

134
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:31,927
Unbelievable.

135
00:17:32,177 --> 00:17:34,888
You better stay alert. Watch your step.

136
00:17:35,138 --> 00:17:38,433
40 years of rust can turn
deck plates into quicksand.

137
00:17:38,684 --> 00:17:43,522
We'll make our way in at the fore,
then check the bridge. This way. Careful.

138
00:17:43,772 --> 00:17:49,486
<i>- Forward mast is history.
- Epps and Murphy, are they a couple?</i>

139
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:54,366
Hell, no. She's like a daughter to him.
He'd be lost without her.

140
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:58,453
Superstructure's in decent shape.
No sign of damage.

141
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:05,544
<i>- Lifeboats are gone, stern to bow.
- Life preserver lockers are all empty.</i>

142
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:08,380
Sure no survivors ever
turned up, Murph?

143
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:13,427
Sure as we're walking on
the "Graza", Dodge. This way.

144
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:28,650
Let's go.

145
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:40,495
Jesus. She's no fiddler's green.

146
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,790
<i>You're wrong, Munder. She's beautiful.</i>

147
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:48,837
Whoever was on here originally
sure left in a hurry.

148
00:18:50,631 --> 00:18:53,175
Murphy, come in.

149
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:10,317
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard. I'm Julie.

150
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:15,072
I'll be your hostess this evening.

151
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:21,078
Have some respect, okay?

152
00:19:28,168 --> 00:19:30,838
Check out all those champagne bottles.

153
00:19:31,088 --> 00:19:33,799
Looks like we missed
one hell of a party.

154
00:19:34,049 --> 00:19:38,220
- And one hell of a hangover.
- Shut up!

155
00:20:05,789 --> 00:20:07,624
- Shut up!
- Let's find the bridge.

156
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,211
- Such a manly man.
- What?

157
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,463
- You all right?
- Shut up!

158
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:17,843
Come on, Mary, let's go.

159
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,725
Murph, how many passengers
did she carry?

160
00:20:24,975 --> 00:20:29,563
Over 600. The créme de la créme
of society from all over Europe.

161
00:20:29,813 --> 00:20:31,565
Crew of 500 from Italy.

162
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:35,986
Talk to me. How's everything going?

163
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:45,495
Okay, good. This companionway
should get us to the bridge.

164
00:20:45,746 --> 00:20:49,750
Here, Epps, hold this.

165
00:21:06,517 --> 00:21:09,311
What's going on?

166
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:12,314
- After you.
- No, after you.

167
00:21:12,564 --> 00:21:15,859
No, no. After me.

168
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,238
Tough guy.

169
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:35,254
Don't let go!

170
00:21:35,504 --> 00:21:39,758
- Pull! Pull!
- Please, Epps!

171
00:21:41,677 --> 00:21:43,720
Please, Epps, don't let go!

172
00:21:43,971 --> 00:21:48,100
- Give me your hand.
- Pull us up!

173
00:21:50,769 --> 00:21:54,398
Oh, God!

174
00:21:57,276 --> 00:22:01,864
I told you to watch your fucking step!

175
00:22:03,323 --> 00:22:07,327
- Oh, shit. Oh, Jesus.
- From now on, you let me lead. Okay?

176
00:22:07,578 --> 00:22:09,746
Let's go.

177
00:22:09,997 --> 00:22:15,836
- I think I just shit my pants.
- No, you always smell that way.

178
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:05,511
Compass is dead.

179
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:11,558
Helm's not responding, either.

180
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:18,690
Fuel tanks are empty. She must've rode
on full throttle till she was bone-dry.

181
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:23,570
Epps!

182
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:32,663
I'm looking for the ship's log.
Let's get this documentation back...

183
00:23:32,913 --> 00:23:35,457
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

184
00:23:35,707 --> 00:23:38,669
- You sure?
- Yeah.

185
00:23:38,919 --> 00:23:42,548
Let's get to it.

186
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:49,054
Hey, check this out.

187
00:23:49,972 --> 00:23:54,768
- It's a watch. Congratulations, buddy.
- No. Look again, you moron.

188
00:23:55,018 --> 00:24:00,357
It's a digital watch. Do the math. They
didn't have digital watches in 1962.

189
00:24:00,649 --> 00:24:05,362
So we're not the first people to board
this ship. But she's ours now.

190
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:11,577
Let's get some sleep, tow her at dawn.
Let's hope there's no more surprises.

191
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:14,454
Amen to that.

192
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,962
Oh, God.

193
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:30,304
Epps, can I get some tea?

194
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,851
Any sign of what might've happened?
How she got here?

195
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:38,937
That's the $64 million question,
isn't it?

196
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:42,065
Ever hear of a ship called
the "Marie Celeste"?

197
00:24:42,316 --> 00:24:47,196
Twin-masted brigantine out of
Charleston during the Civil War.

198
00:24:47,446 --> 00:24:50,699
She was bound for London
with a cargo of cotton.

199
00:24:50,949 --> 00:24:53,202
Thanks.

200
00:24:53,452 --> 00:24:57,873
Two months after she set sail, she was
sighted by fishermen off Tripoli.

201
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:01,835
She was doing 12 knots an hour
in a stiff breeze.

202
00:25:02,085 --> 00:25:08,550
Something wasn't quite right. They
didn't know what so they went onboard.

203
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,513
You know what they found?

204
00:25:14,139 --> 00:25:15,724
Nothing.

205
00:25:15,974 --> 00:25:20,437
No passengers. No crew. No captain.

206
00:25:20,687 --> 00:25:22,814
No sign of distress.

207
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:29,279
59 days after the last log entry, it had
traveled 4500 miles across the ocean...

208
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:37,204
...past the Rock of Gibraltar and into
the Mediterranean Sea at full sail.

209
00:25:37,246 --> 00:25:39,623
And nobody at the helm.

210
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:44,169
- What do you make of that?
- A ghost ship.

211
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:50,342
Hey, you smell that?
I smell bullshit.

212
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:54,847
- Been on the sea a lot longer than you.
- I know.

213
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:59,601
Seen things that
you can't even imagine.

214
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:04,606
<i>Maritime history is full of
Marie Celestes.</i>

215
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:07,442
So, what's our plan?

216
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:11,446
I think we should do what we came
to do. Tie her up, tug her in.

217
00:26:11,697 --> 00:26:17,119
You think our little tug
will pull this entire ocean liner?

218
00:26:17,369 --> 00:26:19,288
Not with the problems we got.

219
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:23,667
We could set her at anchor
and come back with two or three tugs.

220
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,503
No, some Russian trawler
will come along.

221
00:26:26,753 --> 00:26:30,674
I've already looked for her anchors,
anyway. They're gone.

222
00:26:30,924 --> 00:26:33,844
- What do you think?
- Get the engines working...

223
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:38,223
...it could take us two weeks
minimum to tow a vessel this size.

224
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:44,313
For my share of what she's worth,
I'd drag her back to Anchorage myself.

225
00:26:54,448 --> 00:26:56,241
Don't let go!

226
00:26:56,491 --> 00:27:02,789
Help me! Don't let go!

227
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:08,795
- Thought you might want a jacket.
- Thanks.

228
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:20,557
Boy, do I miss that.

229
00:27:20,807 --> 00:27:26,313
You okay? You seem quiet
since you came back.

230
00:27:27,564 --> 00:27:32,027
I think I saw something
I couldn't possibly have seen.

231
00:27:32,277 --> 00:27:34,571
- Like what?
- No, it's crazy.

232
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:38,575
I'm curious. Tell me.

233
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:45,374
I think I saw a little girl.

234
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:47,835
On...

235
00:27:48,085 --> 00:27:51,296
On the... The boat?

236
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:56,343
Yeah. Looking right at me.

237
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,554
And then what happened?

238
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:01,348
Nothing. She disappeared.

239
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:06,103
Sometimes, when I'd be flying
for hours on end...

240
00:28:06,353 --> 00:28:09,648
...I'd think I'd see stuff too.

241
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:15,737
It'd be there one second
and gone the next. Like a dream.

242
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,283
Thanks.

243
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:22,995
- See you in the a.m.
- Okay.

244
00:28:23,245 --> 00:28:26,415
Good night.

245
00:28:27,374 --> 00:28:32,254
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

246
00:28:53,275 --> 00:28:57,613
She's got a big hole.
She's sinking.

247
00:28:58,739 --> 00:29:03,076
- This is where the damage is. See?
- Breach in the hull, about 10 by 20...

248
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:08,248
...torn to the port collision bulkhead.
- Did it hit an iceberg?

249
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:12,252
No, you don't need an iceberg
to rupture a hull.

250
00:29:12,503 --> 00:29:15,923
- She's been hit recently.
- About a week ago, I'd say.

251
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:17,674
This is where we are.

252
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:21,470
The problem's this group of islands.
Nothing spectacular...

253
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,014
...just rocks,
a couple thousand seals.

254
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:28,060
The "Antonia Graza"'s caught here
in this strong current loop...

255
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:32,689
...and slowly she's been pushed towards
those rocks. Last time she hit them.

256
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,442
- What about next time?
- Won't be one.

257
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:39,571
We've got three days to fix it.
That's if the weather holds.

258
00:29:39,821 --> 00:29:41,698
Why can't we tow it like it is?

259
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:45,035
It'd be like towing a car
with four flat tires.

260
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:52,167
- It's a bump in the road. We can fix it.
- Murph, bump in the road?

261
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:56,296
The breach we can probably patch
if we can get to the inside.

262
00:29:56,547 --> 00:30:01,969
We'll weld shut the flooded compartments,
pump out the water up to the aft peak.

263
00:30:02,219 --> 00:30:05,055
On top of that, the rudder's jammed.

264
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:09,893
We jerry-rig it, set a 38-degree
current drift to clear the island chain.

265
00:30:10,143 --> 00:30:12,980
What does all that mean?

266
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:16,358
I just... That's a lot
of work for three days.

267
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:20,904
But with the gear we've got onboard
and what's on that ship, we can try.

268
00:30:21,154 --> 00:30:23,407
We can do it, right?

269
00:30:23,657 --> 00:30:27,369
With the gear we've got onboard,
I can't fix our engine.

270
00:30:27,619 --> 00:30:30,664
Quit bitching and overhaul
the starboard engine.

271
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:34,918
- So that's the plan?
- Just do it.

272
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,717
- I'll call it in.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

273
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,344
- Maritime law states...
- I know.

274
00:30:44,595 --> 00:30:50,809
We just don't want any
unexpected guests. Just leave it.

275
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:53,687
Your call, captain.

276
00:30:56,982 --> 00:31:00,402
All right, you know the drill.
We do a complete recon.

277
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:04,072
Make sure we've got no problems
before we get to work.

278
00:31:04,323 --> 00:31:06,950
- Stay with me, Greer. Don't wander.
- Okay.

279
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:09,703
Dodge, Munder, go to the port
collision bulkhead.

280
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:13,540
Jack and I'll work back from the fore.
Call if you need anything.

281
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:17,127
- How about a pizza?
- You're so funny.

282
00:31:17,377 --> 00:31:22,132
The only plan in this business is that
there is no plan. What is that?

283
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:29,431
What these people talking crazy for?
That's not even good English.

284
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:31,308
Hang in there, okay, "preciosa"?

285
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,813
Because someday he'll find
some other genius to fix his boat.

286
00:31:39,149 --> 00:31:42,444
You want to play like that?

287
00:31:43,737 --> 00:31:45,614
It's still sweet, though.

288
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:49,576
Light coming up.

289
00:31:55,332 --> 00:31:58,627
You were right. She is beautiful.

290
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:01,505
She sure is.

291
00:32:39,877 --> 00:32:46,884
Epps, we're heading for
the main engine room. Epps?

292
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:13,785
All right, "capitano".

293
00:35:18,243 --> 00:35:20,579
Oh, shit.

294
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:24,917
We're gonna have to dive
to get to that tear.

295
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:30,130
Epps, the engine room
is totally flooded.

296
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:34,134
Epps, can you hear me?

297
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:42,226
Wait!

298
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,854
What happened? You okay?

299
00:35:46,104 --> 00:35:51,401
What are you doing down there?
Did you hurt yourself?

300
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:30,941
What are you doing?

301
00:36:33,151 --> 00:36:36,280
The whole bottom's riddled with them.

302
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,991
Looks like someone
used it for target practice.

303
00:36:39,241 --> 00:36:42,703
- That's the happy version.
- What's the not-so-happy version?

304
00:36:42,953 --> 00:36:45,539
There were people in there.

305
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,749
I saw that little girl again.

306
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,920
What? Where?

307
00:36:52,171 --> 00:36:56,258
- I must be losing my goddamn mind.
- Well, did she say anything?

308
00:36:56,508 --> 00:37:00,721
Forget it. Come on.

309
00:37:25,913 --> 00:37:28,332
Murphy, come in.

310
00:37:28,582 --> 00:37:32,252
Dodge! Anybody!

311
00:37:32,503 --> 00:37:35,047
Shit.

312
00:37:37,549 --> 00:37:41,428
I think she's fucking with us.

313
00:38:23,846 --> 00:38:28,141
Looks like central laundry.

314
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:36,400
This vent connects to the forward hold.
We need to see if it's flooded.

315
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:41,613
- I may need help shutting it.
- You sure we need to...?

316
00:38:58,005 --> 00:39:00,507
Murphy, where the hell are you?

317
00:39:00,757 --> 00:39:04,094
- How long have they been here?
- A month, maybe less.

318
00:39:04,344 --> 00:39:07,431
- What are we gonna do?
- Get off this boat!

319
00:39:07,681 --> 00:39:10,017
- But the ship...
- If it sinks, it sinks.

320
00:39:10,267 --> 00:39:12,269
You're right.

321
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:16,148
Stinks.

322
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,775
- What the hell?
- We came through there.

323
00:39:19,026 --> 00:39:22,321
No shit!

324
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:28,035
Come on!

325
00:39:29,703 --> 00:39:33,999
This way. Come on, Jack.

326
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:52,184
What the...?

327
00:39:58,023 --> 00:40:01,443
When'd you start
wearing lipstick, Epps?

328
00:40:01,693 --> 00:40:04,988
Epps?

329
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,660
"Francesca."

330
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:12,162
Nice titties.

331
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:19,211
Not that you can hold a candle
to the future Mrs. Greer, though.

332
00:40:30,389 --> 00:40:37,229
Come on, Jack. Stop dragging ass!
What's your problem?

333
00:40:41,066 --> 00:40:42,818
What's this?

334
00:40:43,068 --> 00:40:47,823
Forget it. Let's go! Jack!

335
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:51,618
'58 Jaguar X150. I've dreamt
about this car since I was a kid.

336
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:57,749
We have to get out of here now.
Do you understand? Now.

337
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:07,968
There's something moving in there.

338
00:41:23,358 --> 00:41:24,568
Fuck!

339
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:28,947
Oh, my God!
I hate rats!

340
00:41:30,032 --> 00:41:32,201
What?

341
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:35,579
Oh, my God! Look at this!

342
00:41:35,829 --> 00:41:37,497
I have to get Murphy.

343
00:41:37,748 --> 00:41:40,792
Murphy!

344
00:41:46,089 --> 00:41:48,050
Is someone trying to call me?

345
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:50,969
Dodge! Munder!

346
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,722
<i>Maureen...</i>

347
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:56,058
Who's Maureen?

348
00:41:56,308 --> 00:42:00,145
It's my first name.

349
00:42:00,437 --> 00:42:03,732
<i>- It's cold...
- He said "cold"?</i>

350
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:07,486
The galley.

351
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:19,998
<i>- It's cold.
- Please help us.</i>

352
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:27,381
Don't go in there.

353
00:43:04,293 --> 00:43:08,380
You fucking assholes!
Fuck you!

354
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:10,465
Take it easy!

355
00:43:10,716 --> 00:43:14,928
You were fucking with us. We fucked
with you. Why aren't you laughing?

356
00:43:15,179 --> 00:43:19,725
Wanna hear something funnier? We
found dead guys in the laundry room.

357
00:43:19,975 --> 00:43:25,147
And this in the cargo hold.

358
00:43:36,366 --> 00:43:39,494
Need some help, skipper?

359
00:43:42,748 --> 00:43:45,375
I'm sorry.

360
00:44:01,683 --> 00:44:03,352
- Jesus.
- Oh, man.

361
00:44:03,602 --> 00:44:07,231
Holy shit!

362
00:44:10,192 --> 00:44:12,611
Yeah!

363
00:44:12,861 --> 00:44:15,614
We're rich!

364
00:44:15,864 --> 00:44:20,410
- You son of a bitch!
- Rich!

365
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:26,208
- Come on. Let's go.
- Move this shit out!

366
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:30,212
One. Two. Three...

367
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:48,772
How much you figure it's worth, boss?

368
00:44:49,022 --> 00:44:54,152
There's a lot of gold. Hard to know.
Two, 300 million, maybe. Maybe more.

369
00:44:54,403 --> 00:44:56,113
- Jesus.
- I don't know.

370
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:59,700
Lock boxes with half of Fort Knox
in them? They gotta be insured.

371
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,370
No way somebody will let
this much gold float away.

372
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,999
Well, the markings have been
filed down.

373
00:45:07,249 --> 00:45:12,254
- What does that mean?
- Someone didn't want this traceable.

374
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:13,547
It's stolen.

375
00:45:13,797 --> 00:45:18,427
It may have to do with the reason
this ship disappeared when it did.

376
00:45:18,677 --> 00:45:22,055
Wait. If the gold's got
something to do with 1962...

377
00:45:22,306 --> 00:45:26,685
...what about the bodies? They can't be
more than three weeks old.

378
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:31,690
Somebody's gotta say it, and it might as
well be me. This ship is fucked up.

379
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:37,112
Earlier I could swear I heard
a woman singing. It's like she was...

380
00:45:37,362 --> 00:45:41,533
- Like she was coming on to me.
- Oh, no!

381
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:47,414
It was the sexiest voice
I ever heard, man.

382
00:45:47,664 --> 00:45:53,837
- She got any backup singers?
- Whatever you're on, get me some!

383
00:45:54,087 --> 00:45:58,050
Maybe you're not quite
ready to get married, Greer.

384
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,927
- Fuck you.
- Okay, guys.

385
00:46:00,177 --> 00:46:02,846
- What about the Coast Guard?
- No.

386
00:46:03,096 --> 00:46:09,228
You call the Coast Guard... What if
the gold did turn out to be stolen?

387
00:46:10,354 --> 00:46:14,233
Under maritime law, anything
found in international waters...

388
00:46:14,483 --> 00:46:18,111
...belongs to the finder. Okay?
That is the law.

389
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,948
- Right.
- Finders keepers.

390
00:46:21,198 --> 00:46:23,992
If we're gonna do this,
I say we do it now.

391
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:28,455
Get our boat going, grab the gold
and get the hell out of here.

392
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:32,042
We leave the boat, take the gold.
Who's with me?

393
00:46:32,292 --> 00:46:35,796
I'm with the gold, man.

394
00:46:36,046 --> 00:46:37,840
Gold.

395
00:46:38,090 --> 00:46:41,426
The gold.

396
00:46:43,554 --> 00:46:46,723
- Epps?
- I just want to get off this boat.

397
00:46:46,974 --> 00:46:50,394
Okay. Let's go to work.

398
00:46:50,686 --> 00:46:57,150
<i>Okay. "Warrior" is in position, Murph.
Can we please get the hell out of here?</i>

399
00:46:57,234 --> 00:47:02,072
Yeah, "preciosa"! Smell that money!
100 million. You hear what I'm saying?

400
00:47:02,322 --> 00:47:05,617
100 million!

401
00:47:06,159 --> 00:47:08,245
Greer? Get those engines going.

402
00:47:08,495 --> 00:47:10,289
<i>I'm bringing the gold down.</i>

403
00:47:10,539 --> 00:47:12,833
Yes, sir, captain, sir.

404
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:18,338
<i>Hey, Santos. Hurry your ass up, "vato".
We almost got the gold.</i>

405
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:24,094
I wanna see these gauges rocking,
because you just had an overhaul.

406
00:47:24,344 --> 00:47:28,599
And you, I want you
to give me some too.

407
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:34,396
Let's do this!

408
00:47:34,646 --> 00:47:36,899
<i>Hey, yo, Greer! Fire it up!</i>

409
00:47:37,149 --> 00:47:42,029
We're going to haul ass.
Bring it on! We'll be so fucking rich!

410
00:47:42,279 --> 00:47:44,239
Stop!

411
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:47,701
Stop! You don't know
what you're doing!

412
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:51,163
We're good to go, skipper.

413
00:47:53,624 --> 00:47:57,169
Don't start the boats! He'll...

414
00:47:57,211 --> 00:47:58,962
Shit!

415
00:47:59,213 --> 00:48:02,299
Greer!

416
00:48:04,134 --> 00:48:07,221
Greer! What the hell just happened?

417
00:48:07,471 --> 00:48:11,892
Jesus Christ! Fire on deck!

418
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:25,614
Santos! Greer! Munder!

419
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:42,297
I got you.

420
00:48:42,548 --> 00:48:48,178
- Epps! I got Munder!
- Greer!

421
00:48:48,303 --> 00:48:50,722
Come on!

422
00:48:50,973 --> 00:48:56,603
Santos!
Santos, answer me!

423
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:21,670
I don't know what happened.
The engine room just blew.

424
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,883
Maybe Santos rushed the engines,
didn't seal up the gaskets right...

425
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:31,013
Jack, did you find anything out about
this ship before you sent us out here?

426
00:49:31,263 --> 00:49:35,184
No, but I... Look, we've got
the gold, and we are still alive.

427
00:49:35,434 --> 00:49:38,061
- Tell that to Santos, asshole!
- Ease up!

428
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,063
This is bullshit!

429
00:49:40,314 --> 00:49:42,441
Santos came here out of free will...

430
00:49:42,691 --> 00:49:45,485
...just like us.
- What does that mean?

431
00:49:45,736 --> 00:49:47,863
- Enough!
- Santos is dead because of you!

432
00:49:48,113 --> 00:49:52,367
Come on! It's not gonna
bring him back.

433
00:50:10,594 --> 00:50:15,307
Murph, it's not your fault.
You know that.

434
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:29,363
How is he?

435
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:34,660
Here's the plan. We're professional
salvors with a fortune onboard.

436
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,080
I say we do what we do best:
Fix this rust bucket.

437
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:40,832
Control her drift. Clear those islands.

438
00:50:41,083 --> 00:50:43,585
We can survive long enough
to get picked up.

439
00:50:43,836 --> 00:50:46,797
Why is this a question?
We have the materials.

440
00:50:47,047 --> 00:50:52,594
Why don't we build a raft and leave?
There is something wrong with this boat!

441
00:50:52,845 --> 00:50:56,265
- If we stay here, we may not survive.
- You want to build a raft?

442
00:50:56,515 --> 00:50:59,101
- I want to build a raft.
- Even with the "Warrior"...

443
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:03,522
...we were stretching to do this
in three days. We can't do this.

444
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:06,191
You're the best spot-welder I know.

445
00:51:06,441 --> 00:51:09,903
We can do it right now,
but I need you.

446
00:51:11,655 --> 00:51:16,827
Fine. But there's no way we're doing
a major patch-and-pump in the dark.

447
00:51:17,077 --> 00:51:19,454
Even with the lights we have,
it'd be like going in blind.

448
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:24,793
Okay, fine. We'll chill tonight
and go in the a.m.

449
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:28,839
Greer? What do you say?

450
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:32,926
Now you want to know what
the first mate has to say?

451
00:51:33,177 --> 00:51:37,389
I say go to hell, Epps. You're not
qualified to get us off this ship.

452
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:40,851
Had Murphy let me do it my way,
we wouldn't be in this.

453
00:51:41,101 --> 00:51:45,022
- And the Coast Guard...
- So it's everybody else's fault, right?

454
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:48,483
They'd be here and we'd
be on our way home, millionaires.

455
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:50,861
That's bullshit.

456
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:54,114
Grow up, asshole.

457
00:51:54,114 --> 00:51:58,410
Fucking bitch! Keep fucking talking.
Say another word!

458
00:51:58,702 --> 00:52:02,456
Say another word!

459
00:52:51,213 --> 00:52:54,049
Here it is. Katie. B-deck.

460
00:52:54,299 --> 00:52:57,261
You were alone.

461
00:53:00,305 --> 00:53:03,475
<i>100-to-1, somebody poisoned
the passengers to get the gold.</i>

462
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:07,479
<i>Okay, Sherlock, if they were poisoned,
why are these cans safe?</i>

463
00:53:07,729 --> 00:53:11,650
They're still sealed.
It's been sealed for 40 years. It's safe.

464
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:16,655
Okay, shoot for it. Loser goes first.

465
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:20,117
- Paper beats rock.
- Come on, man, best of three.

466
00:53:20,367 --> 00:53:23,370
- Bullshit. You lost.
- Where's your empathy?

467
00:53:23,620 --> 00:53:29,585
Winners do not empathize
with losers. Bon appétit.

468
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:39,845
I screwed up.

469
00:53:40,095 --> 00:53:42,014
I should've called it in.

470
00:53:42,264 --> 00:53:46,435
Damn! I knew better!

471
00:53:46,685 --> 00:53:51,273
I'll make it home to you, baby.
I swear.

472
00:53:52,357 --> 00:53:55,944
What the hell are you looking at?

473
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:05,829
- That's all right.
- No way.

474
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,291
No, really. It's good.
Look, I'm not kidding.

475
00:54:09,541 --> 00:54:14,171
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious. It's good!

476
00:54:16,006 --> 00:54:18,383
- You gotta try that!
- That's good!

477
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:20,802
That's great!

478
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:24,223
Katie?

479
00:54:29,853 --> 00:54:33,398
Katie?

480
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,336
Can I tell you something else?
We get back...

481
00:54:54,586 --> 00:55:00,175
...I'm gonna take my money
and I'm gonna buy you a bathtub.

482
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:04,638
I'll get you a lifetime supply
of titty magazines and toilet paper!

483
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:08,934
I already beat you to it, bro!

484
00:55:12,729 --> 00:55:15,899
There's something on your...

485
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:36,879
Katie?

486
00:58:40,103 --> 00:58:43,482
Who, me?

487
00:58:47,444 --> 00:58:51,323
Francesca, I know
all of this isn't real.

488
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:56,203
So I'm just gonna go with it, okay?

489
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:02,668
Can't cheat on your fiancée
with a dead girl, right?

490
00:59:29,027 --> 00:59:32,948
Her parents.

491
00:59:34,199 --> 00:59:37,619
Please.

492
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:41,999
Don't close it.

493
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:47,588
Haven't seen them for years.

494
00:59:47,838 --> 00:59:50,507
They moved to New York.

495
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:55,053
I was on my way to join them.

496
00:59:55,345 --> 00:59:58,307
But they're dead now.

497
00:59:59,057 --> 01:00:01,685
- How would you know?
- When you're like this...

498
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:05,314
...you know these things.

499
01:00:05,647 --> 01:00:08,817
My mother...

500
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:12,029
...she made me this dress.

501
01:00:12,279 --> 01:00:14,990
Do you like it?

502
01:00:18,744 --> 01:00:22,456
You remind me of her.

503
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:26,293
I don't think so.

504
01:00:27,461 --> 01:00:32,424
Well, here. You should have this back.

505
01:00:37,596 --> 01:00:42,476
Oh, God, you really are
a fucking ghost.

506
01:00:45,771 --> 01:00:49,441
Where are you going?

507
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:07,042
Santos was my goddamn responsibility.

508
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:22,724
- The "Lorelei".
- She was adrift. We rescued her.

509
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:27,688
I've heard the story of the "Lorelei".

510
01:01:27,813 --> 01:01:32,317
I didn't know the "Graza" was involved.

511
01:01:33,318 --> 01:01:37,364
The gold was onboard the "Lorelei"?

512
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:43,203
It says here "May 19, 1962".

513
01:01:43,453 --> 01:01:48,542
That's two days before
your ship disappeared.

514
01:01:49,168 --> 01:01:54,298
There were no survivors
onboard the "Lorelei".

515
01:02:00,387 --> 01:02:03,223
Jesus Christ!

516
01:02:06,894 --> 01:02:10,522
Where you going?

517
01:02:29,291 --> 01:02:32,544
Most spirits are free
to be with their families.

518
01:02:32,794 --> 01:02:37,257
So why aren't you with yours?

519
01:02:39,092 --> 01:02:43,514
- We're all trapped here.
- Who?

520
01:02:43,764 --> 01:02:46,350
My shipmates and I.

521
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,353
Even the ones who aren't marked.

522
01:02:49,603 --> 01:02:50,854
Marked?

523
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:53,190
Katie, what do you mean?

524
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,777
When the boat's full...

525
01:02:57,027 --> 01:02:59,321
What? You can tell me.

526
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:05,994
When he has all the souls he needs
and has filled his quota...

527
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:09,289
...we'll all be ferried...

528
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:12,042
...to...

529
01:03:12,292 --> 01:03:15,504
What is it? What's wrong?

530
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:19,383
- What is it?
- He doesn't want me talking to you.

531
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,261
- He who?
- But I'm not like the others!

532
01:03:22,511 --> 01:03:24,096
You need to tell me.

533
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:28,600
You must go at once.
Leave the ship while you still can!

534
01:03:28,851 --> 01:03:32,229
Katie, what is it?

535
01:03:32,437 --> 01:03:37,234
Katie! Katie?

536
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:39,653
Epps?

537
01:03:39,903 --> 01:03:41,864
Come on!

538
01:03:42,114 --> 01:03:45,158
We have to leave.

539
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,746
Where you going, Murphy?

540
01:03:51,748 --> 01:03:54,751
What's the matter? It's me.

541
01:03:55,002 --> 01:03:56,670
Santos.

542
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,925
It's no fun lying
at the bottom of the ocean.

543
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:08,765
No lights at the end of the tunnel.
Not for me, Murph.

544
01:04:09,016 --> 01:04:13,353
No 10,000 virgins at the pearly gates.

545
01:04:14,688 --> 01:04:18,525
Because of the plan, I'm trapped
on this dreamboat of yours.

546
01:04:18,775 --> 01:04:24,740
So you know what?
You're coming along for the ride.

547
01:04:45,594 --> 01:04:48,764
No!

548
01:04:55,604 --> 01:04:58,232
Murphy?

549
01:05:08,075 --> 01:05:11,828
You all right, Murph?

550
01:05:12,579 --> 01:05:15,457
You okay?

551
01:05:18,085 --> 01:05:21,839
- What's the matter, Murph?
- It's me!

552
01:05:27,427 --> 01:05:32,975
- It's me!
- Do it, come on. It'll make you feel good.

553
01:05:38,939 --> 01:05:41,483
Come on!

554
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:50,784
- Come on!
- Hey!

555
01:05:56,915 --> 01:06:01,503
Oh, God.
Epps, you okay?

556
01:06:04,506 --> 01:06:08,051
- Keep him in the aquarium.
- No, listen. He was drunk.

557
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:11,096
He didn't know what he was doing.

558
01:06:11,346 --> 01:06:15,934
Look, he just tried to kill you.
He stays in there.

559
01:06:16,185 --> 01:06:20,230
Let's go find Greer.

560
01:06:29,865 --> 01:06:32,075
Any sign of him?

561
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:33,744
No, we looked all over.

562
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:37,539
Man's pissed off.
Seems to happen on this boat.

563
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:41,126
- Least we weren't around 40 years ago.
- The passengers were poisoned...

564
01:06:41,376 --> 01:06:45,547
...to get to the gold? Isn't that...?
- Extreme? Maybe, but if the shoe fits...

565
01:06:45,797 --> 01:06:48,800
Next thing you know,
we'll be trying to kill each other.

566
01:06:49,051 --> 01:06:52,971
- What's with the heart?
- Found it. Belonged to this little girl.

567
01:06:53,222 --> 01:06:56,725
- What girl?
- She told me to get off this boat.

568
01:06:56,975 --> 01:07:00,437
- She's talking to you now?
- What are you talking about?

569
01:07:00,687 --> 01:07:03,982
- You're seeing ghosts, Epps?
- Just forget it.

570
01:07:04,233 --> 01:07:06,193
So the ship's got a few kinks.

571
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:10,447
Let's stick with Munder's specs
and try to fix the ship.

572
01:07:10,697 --> 01:07:13,951
No way five people and the gold
will fit on any raft.

573
01:07:14,201 --> 01:07:17,663
Murphy's not going anywhere,
and we're not leaving him here.

574
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:23,502
We stick with the plan. Fix the boat.
Let's get going. Come on.

575
01:07:32,469 --> 01:07:35,138
<i>That's the collision bulkhead hatch.</i>

576
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:38,892
<i>- Wheel's busted. It won't open.
- Arming the C4.</i>

577
01:07:39,142 --> 01:07:40,143
<i>- Dodge?
- I'm good.</i>

578
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:41,728
<i>- Munder?
- I'm good.</i>

579
01:07:41,979 --> 01:07:45,440
<i>Contact.</i>

580
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:51,697
<i>- There's the tear, portside.
- Looks bigger from here.</i>

581
01:07:51,947 --> 01:07:56,118
<i>- I'll shut her up.
- No problem.</i>

582
01:07:57,202 --> 01:08:03,125
<i>- Munder, rudder's fixed. You all right?
- I'm good.</i>

583
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:08,172
<i>- What do you think, Dodge?
- She'll hold.</i>

584
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:13,969
<i>- We're set with the pumps.
- Start them up.</i>

585
01:08:14,219 --> 01:08:17,181
Copy that, Epps.
One and two, kicking in.

586
01:08:17,431 --> 01:08:20,976
- I give it 12 hours till she's bone-dry.
- Both on full.

587
01:08:21,226 --> 01:08:24,271
<i>Get ready, Epps. Here it comes.</i>

588
01:08:24,521 --> 01:08:27,399
<i>Great work, guys.</i>

589
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:48,921
Damn. Current's faster than I thought.

590
01:08:49,338 --> 01:08:55,594
If we control her drift, headed in this
direction, we should clear those islands.

591
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:58,680
We'll keep it afloat
until we get picked up.

592
01:08:58,931 --> 01:09:02,100
Son of a bitch.
We may just get out of this yet.

593
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:03,477
Kazillionaires.

594
01:09:03,727 --> 01:09:06,438
Check on the bridge
when you're done here.

595
01:09:06,688 --> 01:09:10,776
I'll see if I can find Greer
down below.

596
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:17,449
Greer?

597
01:09:32,381 --> 01:09:35,634
Katie?

598
01:09:46,645 --> 01:09:50,482
Greer? Jesus!

599
01:09:56,613 --> 01:09:59,199
- Shit.
- Number two's clogged. Who's going?

600
01:09:59,449 --> 01:10:03,036
You go.

601
01:10:03,287 --> 01:10:06,874
Shit. Every single time!

602
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:10,961
Oh, my God.

603
01:10:11,211 --> 01:10:14,631
Come with me.

604
01:10:14,840 --> 01:10:18,385
I want to show you something.

605
01:14:39,813 --> 01:14:41,356
No!

606
01:14:41,607 --> 01:14:44,026
Come on! No!

607
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:47,404
Come on!

608
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:52,492
You can't die on me!

609
01:15:45,212 --> 01:15:47,923
Dodge. Murphy's dead.

610
01:15:48,173 --> 01:15:50,509
- What?
- We have to get off this boat.

611
01:15:50,759 --> 01:15:54,847
There's a reason you, me and Munder are
still alive. That's why he came after us.

612
01:15:55,097 --> 01:16:00,602
- To fix his ship.
- I just saw Murphy. What's happening?

613
01:16:02,187 --> 01:16:05,357
I don't know.

614
01:16:06,024 --> 01:16:08,360
I want you and Dodge
on the rudder.

615
01:16:08,610 --> 01:16:11,113
- But you just said...
- Listen to me.

616
01:16:11,363 --> 01:16:17,327
I'll get Munder, we'll see if the welds
are holding. Stay here till we get back.

617
01:16:17,578 --> 01:16:21,498
I do not want you out of
each other's sight. Take this.

618
01:16:21,748 --> 01:16:25,252
Take it.

619
01:16:25,711 --> 01:16:30,174
- Be careful down there.
- I will.

620
01:17:23,393 --> 01:17:26,980
- That's it, then. We made it.
- For now.

621
01:17:27,231 --> 01:17:30,234
- I'll check on Epps.
- No, she said to wait here.

622
01:17:30,484 --> 01:17:35,489
- Yeah, but...
- Hey, she said to wait! So wait.

623
01:17:47,751 --> 01:17:49,378
You disgust me.

624
01:17:49,628 --> 01:17:52,339
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

625
01:17:52,589 --> 01:17:56,593
You're a pathetic excuse for a man.
She says, "Jump", and you jump.

626
01:17:56,844 --> 01:18:01,557
You're disgusting.
I don't have time for this.

627
01:18:05,936 --> 01:18:10,566
- Who the hell are you?
- The question is, who are you?

628
01:18:10,816 --> 01:18:14,111
You worship her, yet you've
never had the balls to tell her...

629
01:18:14,361 --> 01:18:17,364
...because you're a weak,
cowardly child.

630
01:18:17,614 --> 01:18:24,746
However, if you'll kindly step out of
my way, I'll make your dream a reality.

631
01:18:24,997 --> 01:18:30,043
You know, Dodge, if you kill somebody,
you go to hell.

632
01:18:30,878 --> 01:18:35,966
Well, you live for her.
You willing to die for her?

633
01:19:18,634 --> 01:19:21,929
I shot Ferriman. He's dead.

634
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:24,890
Yeah? Don't be so sure, Dodge.

635
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,894
- What are you doing?
- Trip's over. I'm sinking the boat.

636
01:19:29,144 --> 01:19:31,688
- It's taken its last victim.
- That'll kill us.

637
01:19:31,939 --> 01:19:34,566
- We'll have to take our chances.
- What about the gold?

638
01:19:34,816 --> 01:19:39,112
Fucking kidding? We're not getting the
gold off this boat. Nobody ever does.

639
01:19:39,363 --> 01:19:41,573
Wait, wait. Wait!

640
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,494
That gold can give us everything
we ever wanted.

641
01:19:45,744 --> 01:19:49,248
We could have our own boat.
The two of us.

642
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:52,668
We could have a life together.
You and me.

643
01:19:52,918 --> 01:19:57,589
What are you talking about?
Dodge, we gotta get out of here. Now.

644
01:19:57,840 --> 01:20:01,927
Well, I can't let you do that.

645
01:20:08,016 --> 01:20:11,478
So that's it, huh?

646
01:20:11,812 --> 01:20:14,398
All right. Okay.

647
01:20:14,648 --> 01:20:18,569
You win. All right.

648
01:20:19,903 --> 01:20:21,989
Fucking bitch!

649
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:24,783
All right, you win! Go ahead, do it!

650
01:20:25,033 --> 01:20:27,286
Go ahead. Blow it up!

651
01:20:27,536 --> 01:20:30,455
Kill us all!

652
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:37,754
Hey, Dodge. Why haven't you
asked me where Munder is?

653
01:20:43,385 --> 01:20:47,472
Well, I suppose that's because...

654
01:20:47,723 --> 01:20:49,683
...I already know.

655
01:20:49,933 --> 01:20:53,520
- You won't pull that trigger, Maureen.
- Try me.

656
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:58,567
Dodge made the same mistake.
He's dead.

657
01:20:59,067 --> 01:21:00,819
Katie told you, didn't she?

658
01:21:01,069 --> 01:21:05,199
Souls without sin can't be marked.
Makes them tough to control.

659
01:21:05,449 --> 01:21:08,785
But as long as I keep the boat afloat,
we'll all go down together.

660
01:21:09,036 --> 01:21:12,414
- What the fuck are you?
- I'm a salvager.

661
01:21:12,664 --> 01:21:17,503
Just like you.
You collect ships, I collect souls.

662
01:21:17,753 --> 01:21:21,256
And when I fill my quota,
I send a boatload home.

663
01:21:21,507 --> 01:21:25,219
This will make management happy.
You see, it's a job.

664
01:21:25,469 --> 01:21:28,013
Given to me after a lifetime of sin.

665
01:21:28,263 --> 01:21:34,186
So if I lose this ship, management won't
be happy, which is not a good thing.

666
01:21:34,436 --> 01:21:38,565
I'm not getting through to you.
I'm asking for an exchange.

667
01:21:38,815 --> 01:21:41,026
This ship for your life.

668
01:21:41,276 --> 01:21:43,445
I want my crew back.

669
01:21:43,695 --> 01:21:47,866
Sorry. Once a passenger's marked,
they're mine.

670
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:52,037
Then I guess it's over.

671
01:22:00,212 --> 01:22:03,966
All you had to do was fix the ship!

672
01:22:06,635 --> 01:22:09,471
I gave you a great opportunity.

673
01:22:09,721 --> 01:22:13,475
All you had to do was take it.

674
01:22:16,812 --> 01:22:21,149
What are you gonna do, shoot me?

675
01:25:43,519 --> 01:25:47,898
Careful. Hang in there, ma'am.

676
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:51,148
