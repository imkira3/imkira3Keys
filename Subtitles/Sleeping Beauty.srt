It's a spindle.

But of course you can't touch it.

She's fine.

Don't you know that once a spell
is cast, they cannot be broken?

Only a few days till Dawn sixteenth.

I'm sorry that I have to come drop the inevitable,

195
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:04,083
but I had to make sure that I got my kingdom.

196

And now I shall rule it
for many-many years to come.

All of Alfelter fell into a deep, deep slumber.

When princess Dawn

Good fairies cast a spell of their own.

So that instead of dying,
she fell into a deep slumber.

around the castle to keep people out.

We dead already.

834
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:37,083
Just two of us against untold
number of monster and we're dead.

835
01:02:37,083 --> 01:02:38,918
If Newt can do it,

836
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:41,918
She can survive and so can we.

837
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:52,001
It is indeed that you and I and never refuse
the challenge set main rule, you have an idea?

838
01:02:52,001 --> 01:02:55,000
Actually, I did.

839
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,083
Are these your men who tortured my minions?

840
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:15,959
I know nothing.

841
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,043
I will take care of this.

842
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:24,042
My leash.

843
01:03:24,042 --> 01:03:27,001
- We're here to save you.
- Barrow.

844
01:03:29,001 --> 01:03:33,083
Grulie, you're alive.

845
01:03:37,042 --> 01:03:39,918
Does'nt matter how may you killed,

846
01:03:39,918 --> 01:03:42,918
there are other thousand minions.

847
01:03:43,959 --> 01:03:48,001
I have infinite army that
i can call whenever i wish.

848
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:55,918
For those who rise, and
those who lie, i ask you recent,

849
01:03:55,918 --> 01:03:59,918

and walk with us.

851
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,918
Thank you.

852
01:04:07,042 --> 01:04:09,125
You penetrate all the gate.

853
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:11,959
You broke the gate, unleashing my undead,

854
01:04:12,043 --> 01:04:14,001
into the three kingdoms.

855
01:04:14,043 --> 01:04:15,042
No.

856
01:04:15,918 --> 01:04:17,000
No?

857
01:04:17,918 --> 01:04:19,042
See for yourself!

858
01:04:27,042 --> 01:04:28,083
Oh..

859
01:04:29,001 --> 01:04:32,083
A family reunion of sorcs..

860
01:04:40,083 --> 01:04:42,001
What is wrong with you?

861
01:04:43,001 --> 01:04:45,083
My ghouls will make sure,

862
01:04:45,083 --> 01:04:48,876
that each and every person
will bow down to me.

863
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:51,001
Nowhere..

864
01:04:52,125 --> 01:04:54,083
and no one,

865
01:04:54,918 --> 01:04:56,918
will be safe.

866
01:04:59,918 --> 01:05:00,959
Dawn?

867
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:06,083
please, don't hurt her, just give
her to me, i'll take her far away,

868
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:10,001
you can have your kingdom, just
please.. give her to me.

869
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,918
prince Jayson, can you hear your friend here,

870
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:15,042
He wants the princess all to himself.

871
01:05:15,083 --> 01:05:18,876
He never did know his true position in life.

872
01:05:18,918 --> 01:05:20,083
What should we do with him?

873
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:22,918
Leave him tied up.

874
01:05:24,083 --> 01:05:28,042
We'll deal with him
once we take care of Dawn.

875
01:05:28,083 --> 01:05:31,000
- What happened to you?
- Watch your tongue, Barrow.

876
01:05:31,918 --> 01:05:32,959
Especially,

877
01:05:33,083 --> 01:05:35,959
when you're talking in front of..

878
01:05:36,001 --> 01:05:37,876
my queen.

879
01:05:46,001 --> 01:05:47,042
What about Dawn?

880
01:05:47,959 --> 01:05:49,959
What about your quest for the kingdom?

881
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:52,125
You'll never be a prince, Barrow.

882
01:05:52,167 --> 01:05:55,043
You are within boy, that is all you are.

883
01:05:55,043 --> 01:05:59,000
And all you will ever be
in this kingdom, and the next.

884
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:02,959
Why should i have one kingdom
when i can have three, with Tambria.

885
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,000
Besides,

886
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:07,083
my father will never give me his kingdom.

887
01:06:07,918 --> 01:06:10,000
So i decide to do things my way.

888
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,042
This is my way.

889
01:06:13,083 --> 01:06:15,042
Can we get on with this, please?

890
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,083
And kill her.

891
01:06:25,042 --> 01:06:28,083
I need to see how deep your loyalty lies.

892
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:31,918
Which one of your friends would
you like to kill first?

893
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:35,083
I would suggest you kill within boy guy.

894
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:41,083
What evil has penetrate the prince?

895
01:06:42,001 --> 01:06:44,876
Believe me, i think
it's been always his nature.

896
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,125
We'll never get out of here,

897
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:49,000
especially on time to safe the princess.

898
01:06:51,959 --> 01:06:53,000
Newt,

899
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:54,959
ah, thank heaves.

900
01:06:54,959 --> 01:06:57,001
You should'nt say that,
it still is'nt finished.

901
01:06:57,043 --> 01:06:59,876
You can't assist the princess is it? Yet.

902
01:06:59,918 --> 01:07:02,125
- You know where the princess?
- Of course, why not?

903
01:07:02,959 --> 01:07:06,918
- Could you take us to her?
- To take you to her? Of course, if you'd like.

904
01:07:15,876 --> 01:07:17,001
I think she's headed this way.

905
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:18,083
What do you mean, you don't
know where she is?

906
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:20,918
I've never been this way before.

907
01:07:24,001 --> 01:07:25,000
Run!

908
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:51,125
Alright, you stay back.

909
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,959
You betrayed me.

910
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:08,918
I was just to save myself.

911
01:08:08,918 --> 01:08:10,042
Did'nt seem like it.

912
01:08:10,083 --> 01:08:13,959
What was i supposed to do? Throw
myself on my soul as a sacrifice?

913
01:08:21,001 --> 01:08:23,001
Tambria was going to kill me.

914
01:08:23,042 --> 01:08:25,083
Is'nt sound like a bad idea.

915
01:08:27,918 --> 01:08:31,001
Good men have died underneath your
honor, and now you switch her side?

916
01:08:31,001 --> 01:08:34,001
You are a coward.

917
01:08:55,001 --> 01:08:58,000
- You betrayed Dawn.
- I was never gonna kill Dawn.

918
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:04,001
- How can i trust you?
- You have to.

919
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:06,083
Barrow.

920
01:09:45,083 --> 01:09:46,959
I am sorry.

921
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:51,043
There was no.. other way.

922
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:54,125
She shall take us to the princess.

923
01:09:56,083 --> 01:09:58,001
And kill Tambria.

924
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,083
I'll be your back up.

925
01:10:03,000 --> 01:10:04,083
No.

926
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,959
You should go yourself.

927
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,083
Here,

928
01:10:13,001 --> 01:10:15,083
take this, this is my crest.

929
01:10:17,876 --> 01:10:20,918
She goes somewhere where
i know she was looking, boy.

930
01:10:23,125 --> 01:10:26,043
When my father took your father's kingdom,

931
01:10:27,001 --> 01:10:29,001
he took away your birth right.

932
01:10:33,918 --> 01:10:34,959
I'm giving it back.

933
01:10:42,167 --> 01:10:44,918
Atleast i can face this like a man.

934
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,000
You've returned.

935
01:11:17,001 --> 01:11:20,001
perhaps you're more the man than i thought.

936
01:11:21,001 --> 01:11:22,125
perhaps i am.

937
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:25,043
If i'm to spend an eternity with someone,

938
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:28,083
i need to know that they can be by my side.

939

You don't get anything until you kill Dawn.

940
01:11:31,918 --> 01:11:34,959
You see my armies are out there
conquering, and i can't enjoy it,

941
01:11:35,001 --> 01:11:37,959
because i'm stuck, in here.

942
01:11:39,918 --> 01:11:41,083
I need you to kill her.

943
01:11:50,876 --> 01:11:55,001
- Oh, she's..
- Beautiful? Is that what you're gonna say?

944
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,876
She's also about to be very dead.

945
01:11:58,918 --> 01:12:00,083
Of course.

946
01:12:00,918 --> 01:12:02,959

01:12:10,042 --> 01:12:11,876
Why me?

950
01:12:11,918 --> 01:12:16,918
I've tried to kill her a thousand times, but every
time I get close, I get pulled back.

951
01:12:17,042 --> 01:12:20,083
It's part of the little fairy's cast.

952

Oh, look how sweet!

953
01:12:43,918 --> 01:12:50,083
You try to wake her with the kiss, but
don't you know that only a prince with the
pure heart can do that?

954
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:56,167
- Wake up!
- And it's obvious which one you are.

955

Oh, it's so hot that you trying
to be a man, and you're so close..

956
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:19,083
You'll never get away with this.

957
01:13:19,083 --> 01:13:23,042
How do you know that
if you're not alive?

958
01:13:24,959 --> 01:13:28,959
Bring me the bald one, I
want to play with his head.

psst!

- Of course, I am here to lead you to the princess

01:13:48,001 --> 01:13:49,000
let's go.

962
01:14:02,918 --> 01:14:12,959
If you kill the princess, you'll have your own
kingdom, not a very big kingdom, but a kingdom
nonetheless and I'll obey eternally people.

963
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,125
What would you want me to do?

964
01:14:14,125 --> 01:14:19,001
To stab her through her heart,
I don't want to take any chances.

965
01:14:19,001 --> 01:14:22,043
And you'll have whatever your heart desires.

966
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:30,001
What if I don't?

967
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:36,918
Then I will wake you a dog.

968
01:15:38,001 --> 01:15:41,959
Why can't any of you just kill her?

969
01:15:46,959 --> 01:15:50,083
- Get back!
- Huh, you think you can challenge me?

970
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:54,042
You got nothing against me, you
think you can save the princess?

My liege, listen to me, I know this
gonna be hard, please, listen whithin!

You think he's got cutting his heart?

977
01:16:34,083 --> 01:16:36,125
That's pretty heartless to meaning.

978
01:16:38,083 --> 01:16:41,959
What do you think? You have nothing
with heart? What do you think?

I think not!

I have nothing left, princess
is yours, so wake her up.

993
01:19:22,042 --> 01:19:25,001
Love does conquer the reward.

994
01:19:30,918 --> 01:19:33,083
Look out!

995
01:19:39,042 --> 01:19:41,001
You liar!

996
01:19:45,959 --> 01:19:49,001
He's death, you said
that love conquers all.

997
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,001
And child, it has.

998
01:19:52,001 --> 01:19:55,001
But I stand with the blood of my people.

999
01:19:56,000 --> 01:20:01,000
Woe that us perished at the
hand of the fire of the cruel.

1000
01:20:01,083 --> 01:20:04,918
Rise up for the death of the doom!

1001
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:07,083
I revoke this place!

1002
01:20:07,083 --> 01:20:14,001
Devine power, avenge my
blood and give me strength!

1003
01:20:31,959 --> 01:20:34,959
Avenge my blood!

1004
01:20:37,083 --> 01:20:42,083
Liege, if you don't pick up that sword and
stab that sleeping beauty in the heart,

1005
01:20:42,876 --> 01:20:44,042
We're all liege!

1006
01:20:53,083 --> 01:20:55,125
Come, come, all of you.

1007
01:20:57,125 --> 01:21:03,043
Go to her.
Go to her.

1008
01:21:15,125 --> 01:21:17,001
No!

1009
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,918
No!

1010
01:21:45,125 --> 01:21:55,000
A great creature, you..
you kissed me. Thank you.

1011
01:22:03,001 --> 01:22:10,001
If you think that you can ruin, this glorious
future that I have conquer the last hundred years,

1012
01:22:13,083 --> 01:22:18,042
But since you are not sleeping anymore,
I am gonna to kill you!

1013
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:22,876
Stay back! That is no way
to speak to my princess.

1014
01:22:22,918 --> 01:22:26,834
Tambriel, you are no
longer walk in here. Leave.

1015
01:22:26,959 --> 01:22:30,042
Queen Tambriel, you henceful
banish from my kingdom!

1016
01:22:33,043 --> 01:22:35,001
It is my kingdom!

1017
01:22:59,042 --> 01:23:03,083
One year later.

1018
01:23:23,876 --> 01:23:25,000
It's harmless.

1019
01:23:31,125 --> 01:23:34,959
You may want to come in, my lady,
the party is about to begin.

1020
01:23:35,001 --> 01:23:36,834
One moment.

1021
01:23:38,043 --> 01:23:40,918
It just thing that I
have think long ago.

1022
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:08,042
All gents and ladies, the princess Dawn.

1023
01:24:17,918 --> 01:24:20,042
I remember the story of
the day much likeness.

1024
01:24:20,083 --> 01:24:22,083
- That was when I so young.
- You still young.

1025
01:24:22,083 --> 01:24:26,876
- I am an a hundred years at least.
- Hmm, I guess we'll take.

1026
01:24:27,001 --> 01:24:30,876
- Are you ready?
- I can hardly contain my self.

1027
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:36,959
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you
for coming for the celebration of
the birth of our firstdaughter, Dave.

1028
01:24:37,959 --> 01:24:40,876
Come, the soul of blessing upon her.

1029
01:24:44,083 --> 01:24:46,125
May you always be safe.

1030
01:24:59,918 --> 01:25:03,918
And then it is, happily ever after.

1031
01:25:10,918 --> 01:25:12,918
Or perhaps not

1032
01:25:12,918 --> 01:25:15,959
I would like to present
a gift upon the child.
