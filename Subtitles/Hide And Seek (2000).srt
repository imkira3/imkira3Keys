5
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:26,300
You're okay. Just relax.
Just try to relax, okay?

6
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:29,271
- Hey... how you doin'?
- Good, thanks.

7
00:04:29,741 --> 00:04:33,302
Look, we have a visitor.

8
00:04:33,411 --> 00:04:35,208
She just woke up.

9
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,009
Where am I?

10
00:04:37,115 --> 00:04:39,640
Good morning. Good morning!

11
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:42,152
Sleepy? Hello.

12
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,745
Where am I? Who are you?

13
00:04:44,923 --> 00:04:46,891
Helen, could you get
the phone, please?

14
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:48,755
- Oh, okay.
- Thanks, baby.

15
00:04:51,496 --> 00:04:53,164
Can you raise this arm up?

16
00:04:53,164 --> 00:04:54,893
No.

17
00:04:58,003 --> 00:05:00,563
I couldn't get your ring off,

18
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:03,071
so I had to remove a
little tissue.

19
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:05,472
I used the anesthetic
so it wouldn't hurt.

20
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:07,477
- Here.
- Thanks, baby.

21
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,943
Sorry about that.

22
00:05:11,182 --> 00:05:12,649
Where's Jack?

23
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,414
He's right over here.
Look!

24
00:05:16,755 --> 00:05:19,223
Yeah, right.

25
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:21,122
- Helen...
- What?

26
00:05:21,192 --> 00:05:22,557
Please be quiet, baby.

27
00:05:22,627 --> 00:05:24,219
Don't tell me to shut up.

28
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:26,526
I didn't tell you to shut up.

29
00:05:26,698 --> 00:05:27,722
I just said to be quiet.

30
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:30,299
Tell her what
happened to her head.

31
00:05:30,402 --> 00:05:32,734
- He dropped you.
- You're not really helping.

32
00:05:32,804 --> 00:05:35,534
Well, you did.
He dropped you on your head.

33
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:38,473
- Helen, could...?
- Oh, right. The number.

34
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,634
- Thank you.
- The number.

35
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:46,284
I'm going to call up your husband.

36
00:05:46,351 --> 00:05:49,286
I don't want you...
What do you want?

37
00:05:50,155 --> 00:05:51,087
Let's call.

38
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,252
Mr. White?

39
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:55,521
Who I am is not important.

40
00:05:57,329 --> 00:05:59,627
Just do exactly as I say...

41
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:01,030
or...

42
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:06,770
or I'll kill your wife.

43
00:06:08,173 --> 00:06:10,875
Okay, go ahead, here.
Tell your husband you're okay.

44
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,843
Go ahead, say hello.

45
00:06:12,944 --> 00:06:15,572
- Jack?
- Go ahead. I'm okay.

46
00:06:15,647 --> 00:06:17,342
- Help, Jack.
- Tell him.

47
00:06:18,183 --> 00:06:20,481
- Jack...
- Okay, I'm okay.

48
00:06:21,119 --> 00:06:22,643
I'm fine, I'm fine.

49
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:23,822
I'm okay.

50
00:06:23,822 --> 00:06:25,414
Okay, that's it. That's it.

51
00:06:26,191 --> 00:06:28,159
So there you have it, sir.

52
00:06:29,894 --> 00:06:32,556
If you don't do exactly
as we tell you, then...

53
00:06:33,698 --> 00:06:36,496
we'll have to kill somebody.
Be smart...

54
00:06:37,135 --> 00:06:39,433
very, very smart.

55
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:42,399
Bye.

56
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:45,235
Good, honey.

57
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,937
Now we just can wait.
The waiting game.

58
00:06:48,046 --> 00:06:49,980
The waiting game.

59
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:52,209
Coffee?

60
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:53,716
I want some coffee, yeah.

61
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:55,615
Do you want some coffee?

62
00:07:00,992 --> 00:07:02,892
Are you crying?

63
00:07:04,996 --> 00:07:06,691
Don't cry.

64
00:07:10,468 --> 00:07:11,958
You're very pretty.

65
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:27,649
Okay.
We'll see you in a while, okay?

66
00:07:27,719 --> 00:07:28,981
Bye-bye.

67
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:54,040
You're going to have
to come by the house soon.

68
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:55,374
You won't even recognize it.

69
00:07:59,384 --> 00:08:01,375
I turned his office
into a game room.

70
00:08:02,187 --> 00:08:03,745
Excuse me one minute.

71
00:08:06,891 --> 00:08:08,654
I got the house, he got the crap.

72
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:12,124
- Jack?
- Hey, speak of angels.

73
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,697
- Anne!
- Hi, Emily.

74
00:08:13,798 --> 00:08:16,198
- Hi, how are you?
- Good, thanks.

75
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:20,738
I heard about your miscarriage.
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:25,469
My sister went through two in-vitro
trials before she succeeded.

77
00:08:25,577 --> 00:08:26,339
Are you going to try again?

78
00:08:26,411 --> 00:08:29,039
Well, we're...
we're talking about it.

79
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,548
Jack, Uncle Bob is leaving.

80
00:08:33,518 --> 00:08:35,486
Oh! Oh, okay.

81
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:38,480
Would you excuse
us for a second?

82
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,784
- Thanks.
- Bye.

83
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,255
Jack?

84
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,130
Hey, Jack?

85
00:08:57,408 --> 00:08:58,204
Jack?

86
00:08:59,677 --> 00:09:01,372
Come with me.

87
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,554
Okay...
Do you know where we are?

88
00:09:09,554 --> 00:09:11,681
No... Wha...

89
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,453
- Okay.
- Wha...

90
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,388
- Open?
- Open.

91
00:09:18,997 --> 00:09:20,157
Wow...

92
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:25,396
Oh, it's so beautiful.

93
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:27,664
What... what's this?

94
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:34,043
You're too much.

95
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:35,669
Like it?

96
00:09:43,021 --> 00:09:45,489
I can't wait to have this baby.

97
00:09:46,391 --> 00:09:47,915
I just can't wait.

98
00:10:33,204 --> 00:10:35,331
Honey, what's the matter?

99
00:10:36,007 --> 00:10:37,907
Honey?
Honey?

100
00:10:46,985 --> 00:10:48,509
You okay?

101
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,183
You're so hot.

102
00:10:56,461 --> 00:10:58,486
I think I'm pregnant.

103
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:02,557
Really?

104
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,157
Really?

105
00:11:04,669 --> 00:11:06,296
- I think so.
- Really?

106
00:11:06,404 --> 00:11:07,803
I think so.

107
00:11:13,544 --> 00:11:16,240
You don't want to
kiss me right now.

108
00:11:36,434 --> 00:11:39,961
Anne, wake up.
Time to wake up.

109
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:46,467
Right now, I'm going
to release you from
those nasty handcuffs, okay?

110
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:52,339
Do I have your permission?

111
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,912
What?

112
00:11:55,186 --> 00:11:58,747
It's very, very important
that we trust each other.

113
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:01,791
Trust makes everything
move more smoothly.

114
00:12:01,893 --> 00:12:04,293
Am I making sense?

115
00:12:07,065 --> 00:12:09,966
Good.
So...

116
00:12:11,703 --> 00:12:14,035
can we trust each other?

117
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:16,931
Yeah.

118
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:18,672
What?

119
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:21,973
Yeah.

120
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,878
Yes, what?

121
00:12:26,217 --> 00:12:28,242
We can trust each other?

122
00:12:29,854 --> 00:12:31,583
Okay, then.

123
00:12:39,597 --> 00:12:42,430
You'll feel better when
you see what I have for you.

124
00:12:42,533 --> 00:12:43,522
Look at that.

125
00:12:44,836 --> 00:12:46,167
Ta-da!

126
00:12:47,905 --> 00:12:50,738
It's veal.
I made it especially for you.

127
00:12:50,842 --> 00:12:52,503
Go on.
Take a bite.

128
00:12:58,082 --> 00:13:00,607
Mmm... Mmm...

129
00:13:00,685 --> 00:13:03,119
It's good, isn't it?

130
00:13:03,488 --> 00:13:06,753
I don't eat veal.
You know what it is, don't you?

131
00:13:07,158 --> 00:13:08,318
What veal is?

132
00:13:10,862 --> 00:13:13,558
It's baby cows.

133
00:13:13,731 --> 00:13:16,131
Little baby cows.

134
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:20,127
Haven't even had a chance
to walk yet.

135
00:13:24,075 --> 00:13:25,133
Eat up.

136
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:36,087
Hello? Hello.
Oh, geez, no, no...

137
00:13:36,087 --> 00:13:37,019
I ordered...

138
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:57,298
Oh!
Oh, poor little Anne!

139
00:13:57,475 --> 00:14:00,740
I'm sorry, it wasn't my idea.

140
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:04,439
Frank didn't feel like
he could really trust you.

141
00:14:04,515 --> 00:14:05,379
Not just yet.

142
00:14:05,716 --> 00:14:07,013
Come back to bed.

143
00:14:07,118 --> 00:14:09,586
You shouldn't be
galloping all over anyway.

144
00:14:10,054 --> 00:14:12,955
Here you go, nice and cozy.

145
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:16,958
Here, nice veal.
For you.

146
00:14:18,496 --> 00:14:21,624
What's going on?
Have you heard from my husband?

147
00:14:21,699 --> 00:14:23,132
Good girl.

148
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,399
Finish up.

149
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:27,402
Okay, I'll just be
right up here, on the phone.

150
00:14:27,505 --> 00:14:29,598
If you want anything, call.

151
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:53,661
You're just...
not pregnant.

152
00:14:53,898 --> 00:14:56,366
Are you sure?
Because...

153
00:14:56,467 --> 00:14:57,991
- I... I've had...
- She's been vomiting at home.

154
00:14:58,102 --> 00:14:59,933
- Several at home pregnancy tests.
- Yes.

155
00:15:00,037 --> 00:15:02,005
- They've both come up...
- She's been positive on every test.

156
00:15:02,106 --> 00:15:04,074
- I've been sick every night.
- Right, right.

157
00:15:04,175 --> 00:15:06,735
I could run another
series, but, uh...

158
00:15:07,278 --> 00:15:09,508
Frank Benton,
Anne and Jack White.

159
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:11,875
Hi, how you doing?

160
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,817
- Hi.
- Hi.

161
00:15:14,185 --> 00:15:17,018
Frank, you did cross check
these tests, didn't you?

162
00:15:17,121 --> 00:15:19,089
That's right,
Dr. Webster.

163
00:15:19,223 --> 00:15:23,683
So we, you'd know if there
was something happening.

164
00:15:24,495 --> 00:15:26,190
That's correct, sir.

165
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:30,201
You know, the symptoms
you've been experiencing...

166
00:15:30,201 --> 00:15:33,136
are probably due to
a number of hormonal changes.

167
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:36,604
It's perfectly natural to go through
these fluctuations from time to time.

168
00:15:36,941 --> 00:15:39,535
If you've been under severe stress,

169
00:15:39,644 --> 00:15:41,874
you know that can really
wreak havoc on your system.

170
00:15:41,946 --> 00:15:44,710
You may even read positive
on a home pregnancy test.

171
00:16:02,099 --> 00:16:05,432
I can tell her if I want to...
and you can't stop me.

172
00:16:05,937 --> 00:16:07,131
I've seen it before and
I know what to do.

173
00:16:07,204 --> 00:16:09,001
Yeah, and look how you
solved that one.

174
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:12,370
I could tell her if I want to.
You can't stop me, honey.

175
00:16:12,476 --> 00:16:14,137
You can't tell me what to do...

176
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:15,235
- You're not the boss of the family.
- I can stop you, I can stop you.

177
00:16:15,346 --> 00:16:17,678
- I'm the boss of the family.
- What are you doing?

178
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:21,183
Stop being such an animal.
This is a civilized house.

179
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:24,311
I want you to cut it out.
She's not ready to be told yet.

180
00:16:24,422 --> 00:16:27,823
No! Let go of me.
Let go of me!

181
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:30,217
I can tell her if I want to.
You get away from me.

182
00:16:30,294 --> 00:16:32,159
- What are you going to do?
- Get away from me.

183
00:16:32,263 --> 00:16:34,561
- Anne! I have something...
- No.

184
00:16:34,632 --> 00:16:37,568
- No!
- Cut it out!

185
00:16:37,568 --> 00:16:39,003
Just relax.

186
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:40,766
Just relax.
Just relax.

187
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:42,328
- I am relaxed.
- Just settle down.

188
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,135
- I am settling down.
- Come on.

189
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:46,368
- I am settling, I...
- Come on, baby, come on.

190
00:16:46,477 --> 00:16:47,671
You're going to fuck it up.

191
00:16:47,778 --> 00:16:51,236
I need an aspirin.
Do you have some aspirin?

192
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,749
I need a little...
Anne!

193
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:55,419
Shit!
Don't you tell her!

194
00:16:55,419 --> 00:16:57,853
No! Leave me alone!
Anne, help me!

195
00:16:57,922 --> 00:16:59,184
- Let go of me!
- Cut it out.

196
00:16:59,256 --> 00:17:00,917
- Let go of me!
- Cut it out...bitch.

197
00:17:00,992 --> 00:17:01,924
You have a big mouth.

198
00:17:01,993 --> 00:17:05,190
Anne, you're pregnant and
you're going to have my baby.

199
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,855
Cut it out. Cut it out.
Go upstairs.

200
00:17:07,965 --> 00:17:09,762
- Stop it. It's too late, moron.
- Go upstairs.

201
00:17:09,834 --> 00:17:10,892
- I told her.
- Yeah?

202
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:13,528
Anne, you're going
to have my baby.

203
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:20,037
She was just kidding.
She's just making things up.

204
00:17:20,111 --> 00:17:21,635
You're a jerk, Helen.

205
00:17:29,887 --> 00:17:31,878
I know you.

206
00:17:33,691 --> 00:17:36,489
You work at the clinic.

207
00:17:37,495 --> 00:17:40,726
Dr. Cordon's office.
Right?

208
00:17:43,634 --> 00:17:45,192
Oh, my God!

209
00:17:46,904 --> 00:17:49,498
I am pregnant.

210
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,935
I'm pregnant, and you...

211
00:17:54,111 --> 00:17:55,408
My husband.

212
00:17:55,513 --> 00:17:57,481
Oh, my God!
Where's Jack?

213
00:17:58,149 --> 00:18:00,117
He doesn't even
know you're here.

214
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,078
The ransom and the...
What about the ring?

215
00:18:06,157 --> 00:18:10,617
There's no ransom,
and nobody knows you're here.

216
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:16,898
You're going to have that baby
and you're going to give it to us.

217
00:18:19,737 --> 00:18:25,767
So get some sleep.
You're going to be here a long time.

218
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,261
I can tell her if I want to...

219
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:03,639
Honey, are you there?
It's me.

220
00:19:04,281 --> 00:19:05,873
I guess you're not
home from work yet.

221
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,714
I don't know if you
got any of my messages.

222
00:19:08,819 --> 00:19:11,310
Well, my flight schedule is the same,
so I'll see you in the morning.

223
00:19:11,755 --> 00:19:16,021
I'm gonna keep you up all night.
I love you.

224
00:19:43,888 --> 00:19:45,253
Annie!

225
00:19:49,727 --> 00:19:51,319
Anne!

226
00:20:00,004 --> 00:20:01,494
Anne?

227
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:06,337
Anne?

228
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:18,551
Honey, are you there?
It's me.

229
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:19,350
Annie?

230
00:20:19,423 --> 00:20:21,015
I guess you're not
home from work yet.

231
00:20:21,091 --> 00:20:23,184
I don't know if you got
any of my messages...

232
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:38,669
The car went off a cliff about
three miles north of Point Bonita.

233
00:20:40,678 --> 00:20:44,409
It looks like she just lost control.
I mean, they've taken the car in...

234
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:46,813
to check for the possibility
of brake failure, but...

235
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:50,083
there's just no solid answers yet.

236
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:56,620
I want to see her.

237
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:01,887
- Look, I can understand you...
- Look, don't give me that shit.

238
00:21:02,032 --> 00:21:03,192
Don't give me that shit.

239
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,827
- I want to see my wife.
- There's nothing to see.

240
00:21:05,903 --> 00:21:08,303
The fire burned very hot.

241
00:21:12,443 --> 00:21:13,933
I'm very sorry.

242
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,078
Well, how do you know it's her?
I mean, how can you be sure that...?

243
00:21:21,685 --> 00:21:23,846
You identified the ring
and the chain.

244
00:21:24,922 --> 00:21:28,517
If you've got any questions or
if you're unsure about this...

245
00:21:28,592 --> 00:21:30,992
You didn't find the pendant.

246
00:21:31,128 --> 00:21:33,255
- You don't have the pendant.
- The chain was broken.

247
00:21:33,364 --> 00:21:34,558
The chain was broken
when we found it.

248
00:21:34,632 --> 00:21:37,795
The pendant probably flew
off away from the wreckage.

249
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:40,564
There's nothing left.

250
00:21:44,808 --> 00:21:47,242
I do wish there
was more that I could tell you.

251
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:54,815
If you need to talk,
you know where to reach me.

252
00:21:57,655 --> 00:22:01,352
You'll be the first one to
know if we find out anything new.

253
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:07,930
Good morning, good morning.

254
00:22:07,998 --> 00:22:11,627
It's time to get up
in the morning.

255
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:14,329
Anne!
Anne?

256
00:22:23,947 --> 00:22:28,252
There you are!
You scared me.

257
00:22:28,252 --> 00:22:32,279
What are you doing, all scrunched
up in the corner like that?

258
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:34,949
Look!
Look what I have for you.

259
00:22:35,025 --> 00:22:38,620
It's something different.
It's a delicious macrobiotic shake.

260
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:40,397
I made it myself.

261
00:22:40,397 --> 00:22:42,627
Mmm, mmm...

262
00:22:45,202 --> 00:22:46,328
I'm not hungry.

263
00:22:47,438 --> 00:22:51,898
Well, how about I'll just
put it over here, by the table...

264
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:55,110
and you can eat it over here,
sitting up like a real person.

265
00:22:55,212 --> 00:22:57,077
Would you like that?

266
00:22:58,215 --> 00:22:59,648
Come on, Anne.

267
00:22:59,717 --> 00:23:01,708
I went to a lot of trouble
to make this milkshake.

268
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:05,515
It's got nutrients and things
that you need for the growing baby.

269
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:08,591
Don't be so selfish. It's not like
you're just eating for yourself.

270
00:23:08,892 --> 00:23:12,259
You're eating for the little
one inside. It's very im...

271
00:23:14,832 --> 00:23:15,730
Anne...

272
00:23:18,402 --> 00:23:21,803
Anne, I'm afraid I have to
insist that you drink this milkshake

273
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:23,372
and then we can
get on with our day.

274
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,069
Okay, drink some milkshake.
Drink it.

275
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:29,980
Drink it, Miss Sensitive Stomach.
Drink the fucking milkshake.

276
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,379
I'm not hungry!

277
00:23:33,484 --> 00:23:36,351
All right, this behavior
will not be tolerated!

278
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,422
It will not be tolerated.

279
00:23:38,422 --> 00:23:41,289
This is not acceptable behavior.

280
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:43,389
You...
Frank!

281
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,951
Frank, she's crazy!
She's...

282
00:23:48,499 --> 00:23:51,024
- Psycho bitch.
- Cut it out!

283
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:53,201
See, what did I tell you?

284
00:24:03,514 --> 00:24:06,381
Frank, do you want me
to get the pump?

285
00:24:07,885 --> 00:24:10,020
Shut your mouth! Shut your mouth.
Get it. Get it.

286
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,885
Get the pump?
Okay.

287
00:24:16,026 --> 00:24:17,152
Get over here.

288
00:24:20,531 --> 00:24:23,557
Got it, I got it, I got it.

289
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:27,835
She was upsetting me.
This is out of control.

290
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:29,106
What's your problem?
You don't want to eat?

291
00:24:29,106 --> 00:24:30,539
You don't want to eat?

292
00:24:31,008 --> 00:24:32,498
You know something?

293
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,501
When I was a kid,
my father got me a job...

294
00:24:35,746 --> 00:24:39,113
on a farm that made
pate de foie gras.

295
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:42,311
In French,
it means paste of fat liver.

296
00:24:42,619 --> 00:24:45,782
And there was this old guy, who'd
go around three or four times a day,

297
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:47,881
force feeding the ducks.

298
00:24:47,991 --> 00:24:54,794
And my job was to clean up
after the ducks that would explode.

299
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,724
Really.

300
00:24:57,801 --> 00:25:00,065
And they would make
this terrible sound...

301
00:25:00,137 --> 00:25:02,230
just before they would explode.

302
00:25:02,706 --> 00:25:04,105
- Helen?
- Yeah?

303
00:25:04,208 --> 00:25:05,698
How did it go?

304
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:08,039
They'd quack! Like that.
Like it Louder.

305
00:25:08,111 --> 00:25:11,740
like quaack. Quack!

306
00:25:15,986 --> 00:25:17,886
- Helen?
- Hmm?

307
00:25:17,988 --> 00:25:19,319
Help me out.

308
00:25:23,327 --> 00:25:25,488
Come on,
give me the hose.

309
00:25:28,398 --> 00:25:30,601
Why didn't you just eat?
Why didn't you just eat?

310
00:25:30,601 --> 00:25:31,295
No...

311
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:33,563
Helen, give me the pump.
Help me out. Help me out.

312
00:25:33,637 --> 00:25:35,832
- It's okay.
- You don't want to eat?

313
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:38,066
No, it's okay.
I'll drink it.

314
00:25:38,175 --> 00:25:41,076
- You'll drink it.
- I'll drink it.

315
00:25:41,144 --> 00:25:42,771
- You sorry?
- Yes.

316
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:45,042
Say you're sorry.
Say you're sorry for me.

317
00:25:45,115 --> 00:25:45,911
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:45,983 --> 00:25:48,042
You're sorry?
Sorry?

319
00:25:48,151 --> 00:25:48,776
Yeah.

320
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:50,120
You're going to eat
everything from now on?

321
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,145
You're going to be
good from now on?

322
00:25:53,924 --> 00:25:57,121
- Promise?
- Uh-huh.

323
00:25:57,394 --> 00:25:59,196
I'm ready, Frank.

324
00:25:59,196 --> 00:26:00,720
Don't upset my wife.

325
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,727
- Okay, here, baby.
- What?

326
00:26:04,801 --> 00:26:05,636
- Here.
- I'm going to drink.

327
00:26:05,636 --> 00:26:09,197
No, Frank.
No, she has to learn a lesson.

328
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:11,434
She can't disrespect
her hosts like that.

329
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:13,032
We have to teach her a lesson.

330
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:15,772
We have to do it once
so she learns a lesson, Frank.

331
00:26:15,879 --> 00:26:18,006
She said she'd eat it, Helen.
So just relax.

332
00:26:18,081 --> 00:26:19,673
If you don't do it, God dammit,
if you don't do it...

333
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:20,944
I'm going to do it.
I know how to do it.

334
00:26:21,051 --> 00:26:22,882
All right.
Listen, cut it out.

335
00:26:22,953 --> 00:26:24,648
I'll do it, you little wuss.

336
00:26:24,755 --> 00:26:27,417
Calm down.
I said all right.

337
00:26:27,491 --> 00:26:28,458
Give me the hose.

338
00:26:28,525 --> 00:26:30,254
Give me the goddamn hose.

339
00:26:30,327 --> 00:26:32,625
Can I do the pump part?

340
00:26:32,729 --> 00:26:35,095
Can I do the pump part, Frank?

341
00:26:37,668 --> 00:26:39,158
You don't have to do this.
I'll drink it.

342
00:26:39,403 --> 00:26:40,665
I'll drink it, yes.

343
00:26:44,474 --> 00:26:49,411
Come on, swallow it.
Swallow it, swallow it!

344
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,377
Is it coming up?
Is it coming up?

345
00:26:51,481 --> 00:26:52,641
Is she drinking it?

346
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,316
Open up, swallow it,
swallow it.

347
00:26:57,521 --> 00:27:00,422
That's enough. That's enough.
That's enough!

348
00:27:04,528 --> 00:27:06,052
Give me a bowl.
Give me a bowl.

349
00:27:06,129 --> 00:27:07,858
Here.

350
00:27:11,802 --> 00:27:14,669
- Okay.
- Eew.

351
00:27:15,105 --> 00:27:17,039
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

352
00:27:19,176 --> 00:27:22,202
Relax. Okay, let me
show you something.

353
00:27:22,312 --> 00:27:23,677
Let me show you this.

354
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:29,553
OK, look it. Look it.
Look at that.

355
00:27:29,553 --> 00:27:31,544
Do you see that?
Can you see that?

356
00:27:33,323 --> 00:27:34,381
Did you read that?

357
00:27:35,692 --> 00:27:39,128
Some matches, a car...

358
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:44,763
a cliff, and this was really easy.

359
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:48,429
The only hard part
was finding a body...

360
00:27:48,538 --> 00:27:51,803
for the accident, you know?

361
00:28:13,797 --> 00:28:15,992
I love you, Frank.

362
00:28:36,053 --> 00:28:38,647
- Sorry, I didn't mean...
- It's okay. It's okay.

363
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,756
You know,
it's like I can feel her.

364
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:50,397
- Yeah.
- It's as though, as though...

365
00:28:51,268 --> 00:28:55,295
Look, Jack, if you...
if you need to talk,

366
00:28:55,439 --> 00:28:59,273
or if you need anything,
I'm here, okay?

367
00:29:00,977 --> 00:29:03,605
- Okay, thanks.
- Okay.

368
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:26,564
Frank, I've gained two pounds.

369
00:29:26,636 --> 00:29:31,369
I can feel the skin
stretching over my tummy.

370
00:29:31,475 --> 00:29:32,669
Look, honey.
Look. Look.

371
00:29:32,776 --> 00:29:35,677
Look, Frank, you can see it.
Look.

372
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:36,973
Yeah, I can see it.

373
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:42,385
This morning, I felt
a little bit queasy, too.

374
00:29:42,452 --> 00:29:44,920
- Yeah.
- What else should I be feeling?

375
00:29:44,988 --> 00:29:46,922
Five weeks, five weeks,
five weeks...

376
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,925
Fi...
Heartbeat!

377
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,051
Heartbeat.
Five weeks.

378
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,759
Five weeks: the mother should be
feeling a little bit of a heartbeat...

379
00:29:56,833 --> 00:29:59,199
- That's right.
- And the baby should be about...

380
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:02,238
- Four mm's.
- Millimeters.

381
00:30:02,372 --> 00:30:04,169
- Four mm's. The baby's...
- Millimeters.

382
00:30:04,274 --> 00:30:07,710
Four millimeters in length.
Heartbeat.

383
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,407
Frank, I think I can feel it. See?
See if you can feel it, Frank.

384
00:30:14,484 --> 00:30:15,678
Come on, Frank.

385
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:17,447
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

386
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:22,589
Yes, feel it. Can you feel it?
Listen to it.

387
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:25,126
Put your ear down...
here.

388
00:30:27,364 --> 00:30:29,594
Frank, that's... not.
It's up...

389
00:30:29,733 --> 00:30:32,566
I think it's a girl, baby.
I can smell it better from here.

390
00:30:32,669 --> 00:30:33,693
No, no, I don't...

391
00:30:34,471 --> 00:30:36,871
Frank, you're too late!
I'm already pregnant!

392
00:30:37,874 --> 00:30:40,866
- Oh, man, come on.
- You know the rules.

393
00:30:40,977 --> 00:30:45,038
There's absolutely
no sex during pregnancy.

394
00:30:45,115 --> 00:30:45,877
You know the rules.

395
00:30:45,949 --> 00:30:48,679
Come on, don't you think you're
taking it a little too far?

396
00:30:48,819 --> 00:30:51,219
No, I'm not taking it
a little too far.

397
00:30:51,288 --> 00:30:53,347
A baby is a very fragile thing.

398
00:30:53,423 --> 00:30:57,223
It doesn't want things coming and
banging at it while it's trying to grow.

399
00:30:57,294 --> 00:30:59,489
You're gonna set yourself
up for a big disappointment.

400
00:30:59,596 --> 00:31:02,292
I'm not setting myself
up for a disappointment.

401
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,836
We're doing everything right
this time, so nothing can go wrong.

402
00:31:07,671 --> 00:31:10,273
I think I should perform
an amniocentesis.

403
00:31:10,273 --> 00:31:11,570
I think it would be...

404
00:31:11,675 --> 00:31:15,042
No! What?
No, no!

405
00:31:15,178 --> 00:31:17,510
No amniothesis!

406
00:31:18,648 --> 00:31:20,884
Okay, okay.
I take it back.

407
00:31:20,884 --> 00:31:23,954
But I just want you to understand,
things can happen, okay?

408
00:31:23,954 --> 00:31:26,047
- I know.
- You just be very careful.

409
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:26,655
Okay.

410
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:28,987
Okay?
It's gonna be fine, okay, baby?

411
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:30,549
- All right.
- It'll be fine.

412
00:31:30,627 --> 00:31:33,027
- Okay.
- We'll have our baby.

413
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:36,963
You know, I read somewhere
that you should have sex...

414
00:31:38,235 --> 00:31:40,430
while you're pregnant.

415
00:31:40,537 --> 00:31:41,504
All the medical books...

416
00:31:41,571 --> 00:31:43,163
You did not.

417
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:45,468
- Mm-hmm.
- You're making that up.

418
00:31:45,542 --> 00:31:46,474
I'm not making that up.

419
00:31:46,576 --> 00:31:50,012
Look, I don't wanna take
any unnecessary chances.

420
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:52,513
- Let me explain.
- But if you...

421
00:31:52,616 --> 00:31:54,413
need to jerk off, I could...

422
00:31:54,484 --> 00:31:59,888
do a little dance or something
for you, to turn you on.

423
00:31:59,956 --> 00:32:02,823
Why should I have to jerk off
when I can help the baby?

424
00:32:02,959 --> 00:32:05,553
No! Frank!
No, you'll confuse the baby.

425
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:06,527
No!

426
00:32:26,149 --> 00:32:27,411
Frank...

427
00:32:29,019 --> 00:32:30,486
Frank, are you there?

428
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:37,693
- Yeah?
- Could you come into my office?

429
00:32:38,528 --> 00:32:40,655
Can it wait?
I'm in the middle of something.

430
00:32:40,764 --> 00:32:44,825
I've got Jack White on the phone.
It's about his wife.

431
00:32:50,006 --> 00:32:52,531
I'm coming in a second, all right?

432
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,910
Shit.

433
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,342
Mr. White, I have
Frank Benton with me now.

434
00:33:03,453 --> 00:33:06,217
Mr. Benton, hi.
It's.. it's Jack White.

435
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:10,690
Um... what can I do for you, sir?

436
00:33:10,794 --> 00:33:15,565
Well, I... I really need
to find out something,

437
00:33:15,565 --> 00:33:19,069
I mean, anything about
what happened to her,

438
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,400
and I'm wondering if
you can remember anything...

439
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:23,200
from the day
that we came in,

440
00:33:23,273 --> 00:33:26,436
anything unusual that might help...

441
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:29,404
Did-did you call the police, sir?

442
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:30,240
Well, yeah.

443
00:33:30,313 --> 00:33:35,012
I'm just trying to get any
information that might help them.

444
00:33:35,085 --> 00:33:38,452
I think you were having
your third child, right, sir?

445
00:33:38,588 --> 00:33:39,350
Or...

446
00:33:39,923 --> 00:33:43,450
- your second child?
- Uh, no.

447
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:47,018
You know, sir, it was a really,
it was a-a long time ago.

448
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:50,058
It's a little bit of a blur
for me now, sir.

449
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:54,728
I can't really help you out
that much, sir. I'm really sorry.

450
00:33:56,139 --> 00:33:57,834
Okay, thank you.
Thanks very much.

451
00:33:57,941 --> 00:34:00,034
Sorry. I won't take up
any more of your time.

452
00:34:01,611 --> 00:34:04,512
- Okay.
- Thanks.

453
00:34:07,851 --> 00:34:11,412
Are you all right, Frank?
You look a little flushed.

454
00:34:11,521 --> 00:34:17,289
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm just really hot today, you know?

455
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,294
I'm gonna go back to work.
I'm, I'm...

456
00:34:49,492 --> 00:34:53,326
Good morning, Anne.
It's a lovely day outside.

457
00:34:53,430 --> 00:34:56,797
Wake up.
I have a little surprise for you.

458
00:34:56,866 --> 00:34:58,527
You'll love this.

459
00:34:59,702 --> 00:35:01,192
I've been thinking, Anne,

460
00:35:01,271 --> 00:35:05,605
and I think there's been
entirely too much hostility lately.

461
00:35:06,009 --> 00:35:08,500
There's no reason
you and I can't be friends.

462
00:35:08,578 --> 00:35:10,773
And so, I was thinking...

463
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,007
perhaps the reason why
you're so cranky all the time

464
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:15,517
is because you look so bad.

465
00:35:15,618 --> 00:35:19,145
I myself find that, when
I'm a little bit depressed,

466
00:35:19,255 --> 00:35:21,052
it's always nice to put on makeup.

467
00:35:21,124 --> 00:35:23,251
It cheers your spirits right up.

468
00:35:24,194 --> 00:35:26,185
Oh, you look pretty.

469
00:35:27,263 --> 00:35:29,458
So, this is fun, isn't it?

470
00:35:30,166 --> 00:35:33,863
Anyhow, I think you should
tell me a little bit about yourself.

471
00:35:33,937 --> 00:35:36,838
Of course, I know little things,
medical things.

472
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:40,740
I know you had chicken pox when
you were four, didn't we all?

473
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,641
And you came about this close

474
00:35:42,712 --> 00:35:45,306
to getting breast implants
with Dr. Marshall.

475
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:49,476
I myself don't need implants.
I'm naturally buxom like my mother,

476
00:35:49,552 --> 00:35:52,385
but I can understand where you
would feel inadequate,

477
00:35:52,455 --> 00:35:55,219
and perhaps, you know, want
to augment yourself,

478
00:35:55,325 --> 00:35:56,417
but anyway...

479
00:35:57,594 --> 00:36:00,028
You know, Anne, it'd be nice
if you tried to engage

480
00:36:00,096 --> 00:36:01,620
in a little bit of conversation.

481
00:36:01,731 --> 00:36:05,360
For example, you could say something
like "Good morning, Helen"

482
00:36:05,468 --> 00:36:08,699
when I come in, or
"Lovely day, isn't it?"

483
00:36:08,771 --> 00:36:11,797
or, "Isn't the weather beautiful?"
Little things like that.

484
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:13,875
It kinda helps lubricate
a relationship.

485
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,807
Look.
Look how cute you are.

486
00:36:15,879 --> 00:36:17,369
Fuck you.

487
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:22,140
What?
What did you say to me?

488
00:36:22,218 --> 00:36:25,449
You little bitch!
After all I've done for you!

489
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,659
Well, I guess I can't really
expect much from you, can I?

490
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:37,157
Little Miss Trailer Park Trash.

491
00:36:37,734 --> 00:36:41,761
Now I know you and I disagree
on a lot of things.

492
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:45,238
In fact, I'm willing to wager
that there's not one single thing

493
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:48,504
that you think we agree on.
Am I right?

494
00:36:48,678 --> 00:36:51,704
But there is.
There is, Anne.

495
00:36:51,781 --> 00:36:57,742
There's one very, very, very
important thing that we agree on.

496
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:02,757
You know what it is? We both
want what's best for the child.

497
00:37:02,825 --> 00:37:04,725
It's my child.

498
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:14,894
Frank and I, we've wanted this
baby for a long time, Anne.

499
00:37:15,004 --> 00:37:21,341
I was pregnant once, but then
Frank ran some tests

500
00:37:21,411 --> 00:37:27,247
and he found out that, it,
that the baby was deformed.

501
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:37,116
So Frank performed an abortion, and
something really terrible happened...

502
00:37:37,293 --> 00:37:42,890
and now I can't have
babies again. Ever.

503
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:49,370
It wasn't Frank's fault.
I told him.

504
00:37:49,472 --> 00:37:53,033
I said, "Frank, it's not your fault."
Things can go wrong, you know?

505
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:56,273
He's been trying
to make it up to me.

506
00:37:56,379 --> 00:37:59,280
It was very hard
on our relationship.

507
00:38:00,283 --> 00:38:01,716
You see,
he did want a baby.

508
00:38:01,818 --> 00:38:04,252
He wanted a baby almost
as bad as I did.

509
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,856
Just not that one.

510
00:38:06,856 --> 00:38:11,427
It had the same deformity that
Frank's little brother Alex had,

511
00:38:11,427 --> 00:38:16,831
his... lobster hands and...
lobster feet.

512
00:38:16,899 --> 00:38:20,494
That won't happen again,
not this time.

513
00:38:20,603 --> 00:38:23,572
I just want what's best
for my baby.

514
00:38:29,512 --> 00:38:33,846
- Are you going to kill me?
- What?

515
00:38:33,916 --> 00:38:36,441
After I have the baby,
are you going to kill me?

516
00:38:38,321 --> 00:38:43,315
Please...
Helen, please.

517
00:38:47,664 --> 00:38:52,795
Oh, Anne. I wish I could tell you
how beautiful it feels.

518
00:38:54,304 --> 00:39:00,539
Something is growing inside of me.
I can almost sense its pulse.

519
00:39:02,945 --> 00:39:06,416
What will it look like,
my little baby?

520
00:39:06,416 --> 00:39:11,547
Will it be a boy or a girl?
Will it look like me?

521
00:39:12,755 --> 00:39:15,883
I'll tell you a secret, Anne.
You remember...

522
00:39:15,992 --> 00:39:19,758
when Frank took out your eggs,
and he fertilized them,

523
00:39:19,862 --> 00:39:23,628
and he put one back?
He threw away yours.

524
00:39:24,834 --> 00:39:32,206
Yes, and then he put back my egg.
My baby.

525
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:38,005
Isn't it wonderful?
The wonder of life.

526
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:41,546
Anne, before,
you didn't know me then,

527
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:44,609
but I was angry.
I was a victim.

528
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:50,125
Now, not a day goes
by when I don't ask, why me?

529
00:39:50,193 --> 00:39:53,162
Why am I so lucky?

530
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:58,089
Ah!
Oh, my God!

531
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:37,069
All right, let's work on
the lower extremities.

532
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,004
Try something where you
lay down on your belly.

533
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:50,275
Gentle, Anne.
Gentle, okay?

534
00:40:53,956 --> 00:40:56,117
You need to work your lower back.
This is really important.

535
00:40:56,192 --> 00:40:58,922
- Right here.
- I can do it myself.

536
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:01,227
I know you can do it yourself.

537
00:41:01,297 --> 00:41:03,060
I don't want you to
overwork yourself.

538
00:41:03,166 --> 00:41:06,533
Helen and I aren't going to
take any chances with you.

539
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:09,932
I mean, if you were to...

540
00:41:10,039 --> 00:41:14,305
have a miscarriage,
she would be very upset.

541
00:41:15,044 --> 00:41:16,978
And that would upset me.

542
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,247
Just relax.

543
00:41:22,118 --> 00:41:27,420
These exercises are for
the baby, okay? It's all for the baby.

544
00:41:29,358 --> 00:41:30,916
- Don't touch me!
- Enough.

545
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,826
What did you say?
What did you say?

546
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:38,594
Don't upset me, all right?
Just relax.

547
00:41:42,772 --> 00:41:46,833
Try some where you clamp against
my fist here with your thighs.

548
00:41:48,478 --> 00:41:54,542
This is an important exercise
for delivery. Okay?

549
00:41:55,084 --> 00:42:01,990
Clamp down on three.
All right? One, two, three.

550
00:42:02,058 --> 00:42:04,720
What's going on down here?

551
00:42:05,194 --> 00:42:08,061
Hey, baby, just doing
a little exercise here.

552
00:42:16,005 --> 00:42:18,200
- Come up here.
- Well, it's about time.

553
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:20,241
She was getting a little flabby.

554
00:42:21,143 --> 00:42:23,407
Do some push-ups against the pole.

555
00:42:23,513 --> 00:42:25,003
Right here,
it's a little squishy.

556
00:42:25,114 --> 00:42:27,810
Can you see that, honey?
Here, where it's squishy?

557
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,645
You look so pretty today, baby.

558
00:42:29,752 --> 00:42:32,721
Thank you.
I'm going to town.

559
00:42:32,922 --> 00:42:37,416
Okay, keep working that lower back.
That's it, work this muscle in here.

560
00:42:38,094 --> 00:42:39,857
That's easy.
I could do that.

561
00:42:39,929 --> 00:42:41,226
- Helen?
- What?

562
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:43,525
- I'm working with her, okay?
- Okay.

563
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:47,194
- I'm concentrating, all right, baby?
- All right.

564
00:42:47,637 --> 00:42:49,161
That's a nice dress.

565
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,901
Thank you.

566
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:59,705
I'm going to the store.
Do you want me to get you anything?

567
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:01,942
No, baby, no, thanks.
We're okay.

568
00:43:03,786 --> 00:43:05,413
All right.

569
00:43:06,322 --> 00:43:11,123
Love you.
I love you.

570
00:43:12,228 --> 00:43:13,752
Don't over do it.

571
00:43:14,597 --> 00:43:16,360
See you in a little while, okay?

572
00:43:16,732 --> 00:43:18,632
I love you.

573
00:43:19,402 --> 00:43:23,168
I love you.
I love you.

574
00:43:28,744 --> 00:43:30,473
Go on the bed.

575
00:44:21,864 --> 00:44:29,532
In a loving way,
you turn my night into day...

576
00:44:30,573 --> 00:44:37,479
In a loving way you have chased
the blues away

577
00:44:37,546 --> 00:44:41,346
When I was oh, so alone...

578
00:45:01,904 --> 00:45:02,768
Fuck!

579
00:45:05,141 --> 00:45:12,377
In a loving way, we
will find a love nest, too.

580
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,780
And we will...

581
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:24,253
Shut up.

582
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,191
You're going to be nice.

583
00:45:33,235 --> 00:45:35,260
You gonna be nice?

584
00:45:38,374 --> 00:45:39,602
You're going to be nice to me.

585
00:45:43,145 --> 00:45:44,271
Frank!

586
00:45:46,649 --> 00:45:47,274
Fuck!

587
00:45:52,021 --> 00:45:53,613
Frank!
Frank!

588
00:46:08,671 --> 00:46:11,640
I forgot my purse.
That was quick.

589
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:15,677
Finished, already?

590
00:46:15,845 --> 00:46:19,474
- She was tired.
- Frank, what's that smell?

591
00:46:21,984 --> 00:46:23,246
What smell?

592
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:28,552
Ahh, it's right, it's like a
flowery smell mixed with...

593
00:46:28,624 --> 00:46:31,092
I don't know.
You can't smell it?

594
00:46:31,227 --> 00:46:33,422
No, baby, I don't smell anything.

595
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:35,656
You telling me you
can't smell this smell?

596
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:39,599
Come over here.
You can smell it over here.

597
00:46:39,668 --> 00:46:42,865
It's really strong.
Over here, where I was standing.

598
00:46:42,938 --> 00:46:45,236
Come on, come here.
Smell this.

599
00:46:45,341 --> 00:46:47,332
All right, here.
It's really strong.

600
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,741
It's like flowers and something else.
Pungent, like stinky.

601
00:46:49,845 --> 00:46:51,904
Listen, baby, listen.

602
00:46:51,981 --> 00:46:52,811
What?

603
00:46:52,882 --> 00:46:54,713
I don't... I don't smell.
Maybe it's her sweat.

604
00:46:54,817 --> 00:46:55,918
- Wait, I smell it here.
- You have to be quiet.

605
00:46:55,918 --> 00:46:56,907
- Here's where I smell it.
- Be quiet.

606
00:46:57,019 --> 00:46:58,111
What?

607
00:46:58,654 --> 00:47:00,554
She's sleeping.

608
00:47:00,623 --> 00:47:03,023
Eew! Right here.
It's really strong. Frank.

609
00:47:06,128 --> 00:47:08,995
Frank?
Did you empty the port-a-potty?

610
00:47:09,064 --> 00:47:10,292
Not yet.

611
00:47:10,399 --> 00:47:14,028
- Nooo?
- Nooo. Not yet.

612
00:47:14,103 --> 00:47:16,594
I don't know you think you can
just mask that

613
00:47:16,705 --> 00:47:18,297
with all kinds of air freshener?

614
00:47:18,374 --> 00:47:21,138
You can't fool me.
I can smell smells.

615
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,007
I have a very strong nose.

616
00:47:23,112 --> 00:47:27,481
You can't just come in here and
make promises like you always do

617
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:30,313
and say you're going to
empty the port-a-potty

618
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:31,114
and then mask...

619
00:47:31,187 --> 00:47:33,917
mask it with air freshener smell.

620
00:47:34,857 --> 00:47:35,915
- Listen.
- Wha...

621
00:47:36,025 --> 00:47:37,458
Didn't I say I'd do
it by the end of the day?

622
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,891
Didn't I say by the end of the day?

623
00:47:38,994 --> 00:47:40,461
Yes, you said by
the end of the day.

624
00:47:40,529 --> 00:47:44,021
Is the end of the day here yet?
Has the day ended yet?

625
00:47:44,099 --> 00:47:45,930
- It's almost.
- Well, it's not over yet.

626
00:47:46,035 --> 00:47:46,899
- Now come on, let's go.
- It's almost over.

627
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:48,960
It's not over yet
and I will do it today.

628
00:47:49,038 --> 00:47:51,871
Now come on, let's go...

629
00:47:52,007 --> 00:47:54,373
The whole house is stinky.

630
00:47:54,443 --> 00:47:57,412
You didn't give
me a kiss hello, nothing.

631
00:48:39,688 --> 00:48:42,953
- It's just not enough.
- She never left the house without it.

632
00:48:46,295 --> 00:48:47,227
If there was more to
go on, maybe...

633
00:48:47,296 --> 00:48:49,890
What more do you need?
She never took the thing off.

634
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:54,061
Why did I find it in our house?
The chain was found at the crash site.

635
00:48:54,236 --> 00:48:56,136
It broke.
She took it with her.

636
00:48:56,205 --> 00:48:58,002
I mean, there's a thousand different
ways that this could happen.

637
00:48:58,107 --> 00:49:00,769
Something is going on.
I'm asking you find out what it is.

638
00:49:00,876 --> 00:49:03,970
Jack, really. I think we've
done all that we can for now.

639
00:49:04,213 --> 00:49:06,272
Look, I'm going to
ride you until you help me,

640
00:49:06,348 --> 00:49:07,815
so you might as well help me.

641
00:49:07,917 --> 00:49:09,680
The best help that
I can give you right now

642
00:49:09,752 --> 00:49:11,845
is to recommend a
good therapist.

643
00:49:11,987 --> 00:49:15,286
Fuck you!
Don't you fucking patronize me.

644
00:49:15,424 --> 00:49:18,757
What if that wasn't her in the car?
What if she's still alive?

645
00:49:18,861 --> 00:49:20,663
You're going to do nothing?

646
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:23,223
For your sake, I hope
that she's still alive, okay?

647
00:49:23,299 --> 00:49:25,062
I really do, Jack.

648
00:49:26,635 --> 00:49:27,897
I'm very sorry.

649
00:49:55,798 --> 00:50:02,033
April showers, Easter Bunny,
la la flowers...

650
00:50:02,104 --> 00:50:03,230
Frank?

651
00:50:03,339 --> 00:50:07,676
Frank, I found a very large
Easter egg outside the front door.

652
00:50:07,676 --> 00:50:11,237
A very large Easter egg.
It was outside the front door.

653
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:25,726
La di la la. Summer's here.
Time to eat watermelon

654
00:50:25,828 --> 00:50:27,921
and drink some beer.

655
00:50:33,902 --> 00:50:38,066
October, the most
fertile month of the year.

656
00:50:38,173 --> 00:50:44,373
October, October's almost
gone now that it's been here.

657
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:46,505
Frank, want to hear
my October song?

658
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:08,497
I love my little baby.
Aw, what's that?

659
00:51:08,604 --> 00:51:12,768
You're hungry.
Would you like some milk?

660
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:16,470
We're out of fresh milk,
but look, I have a bottle.

661
00:51:16,578 --> 00:51:20,947
Some. I don't care.
I don't care. Drink it.

662
00:51:21,016 --> 00:51:24,543
Drink, drink, drink,
drink, drink, drink.

663
00:51:24,653 --> 00:51:26,848
I'll cut you out.
Frank will cut you out

664
00:51:26,922 --> 00:51:30,221
if you're not good.
I can't stand you.

665
00:51:32,628 --> 00:51:34,493
It's so hard being a mother.

666
00:51:44,073 --> 00:51:47,873
Arms out!
Come on, hut, hut. Come on...

667
00:51:47,976 --> 00:51:54,779
Arms out. Keep going, Anne.
Come on, one, hut, hut, hut,

668
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,977
two, three, hut, two, three.

669
00:51:59,221 --> 00:52:03,749
Come on, Anne. Come on.
Arms out, hut, hut, hut.

670
00:52:03,826 --> 00:52:07,023
Come on, hut, hut.
Keep going, Anne. Come on.

671
00:52:07,096 --> 00:52:13,296
Arms out, arms out, hut, hut.
All right, keep going, keep going.

672
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:16,433
Don't stop, Anne.

673
00:52:23,212 --> 00:52:26,477
Frank! Frank! Frank!
Someone's coming.

674
00:52:31,687 --> 00:52:33,848
Frank! Frank!
Hide Anne.

675
00:52:38,627 --> 00:52:39,719
Get down, get down!

676
00:52:40,729 --> 00:52:42,128
Get down, get down!

677
00:52:46,502 --> 00:52:48,094
Down, stay down.
Stay down.

678
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:56,810
Stay close.
Shut up.

679
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:12,924
Hello?

680
00:53:13,162 --> 00:53:15,653
Hi, Happy Bottoms at your service.

681
00:53:15,764 --> 00:53:17,322
Happy Bottoms?

682
00:53:17,432 --> 00:53:18,296
Diaper service.

683
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:21,564
I'm Dana, your diaper
technologist engineer.

684
00:53:21,904 --> 00:53:23,735
Well, I'm afraid
there must be some mistake.

685
00:53:23,805 --> 00:53:26,433
You see, I haven't even
had my baby yet.

686
00:53:27,576 --> 00:53:30,204
Well, there was an information
card you filled out at the market.

687
00:53:30,312 --> 00:53:32,439
- I did?
- I'm here to drop off some samples.

688
00:53:33,048 --> 00:53:36,540
Ahhh!
You bit me!

689
00:53:36,919 --> 00:53:38,910
- Shit.
- Excuse me?

690
00:53:38,987 --> 00:53:41,455
Come on in. Hurry it up.
I haven't got all day.

691
00:53:49,731 --> 00:53:54,293
The kitchen's usually the best place
for the Happy Bottoms' diaper pail.

692
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:56,428
So, when are you due?

693
00:53:56,505 --> 00:53:57,233
Oh...

694
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:02,277
- Real soon now.
- Is this your first?

695
00:54:02,277 --> 00:54:05,440
Uh, yes, it's our first
darling little treasure.

696
00:54:05,514 --> 00:54:07,379
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.

697
00:54:07,449 --> 00:54:10,077
I think you're going to
be real pleased with our service.

698
00:54:10,886 --> 00:54:14,014
Anne, cut it out.
Watch the baby.

699
00:54:16,291 --> 00:54:19,055
Wait!
Wait, what about samples?

700
00:54:19,161 --> 00:54:20,992
Oh, I can leave these here for ya.

701
00:54:21,063 --> 00:54:22,155
Oh, okay.

702
00:54:30,038 --> 00:54:34,702
- This could be it.
- Oh, my God, how exciting.

703
00:54:45,187 --> 00:54:46,745
It's going to be okay.
Everything's okay.

704
00:54:46,822 --> 00:54:50,349
I'm here for you.
Okay, breathe. I'm here for you...

705
00:54:50,425 --> 00:54:52,518
- It hurts.
- It's going to be okay.

706
00:54:52,628 --> 00:54:55,324
- Breathe. Breathe in, out...
- Hot towels.

707
00:54:55,430 --> 00:54:58,092
- Water. Give me water.
- Out, oh...

708
00:55:00,736 --> 00:55:03,034
Oh, God!
Push. Breathe.

709
00:55:11,346 --> 00:55:14,042
Get the fuck away
from my baby, you bitch!

710
00:55:14,149 --> 00:55:16,208
What the fuck is
the matter with you?

711
00:55:16,318 --> 00:55:19,488
You think you can put your hands
all over me just because I'm pregnant?

712
00:55:19,488 --> 00:55:22,651
Wait, wait, wait.
I want those diapers.

713
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:27,484
So, um, I guess we'll
get the matching ones.

714
00:55:27,596 --> 00:55:30,929
You know, the matching ones?
And the weekly delivery.

715
00:55:30,999 --> 00:55:33,797
Look, look, I'm really
sorry about what happened.

716
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:36,736
I'm my hormones are raging.
I'm pregnant, you know?

717
00:55:37,906 --> 00:55:40,431
Hey, lady,
I said we'd get the diapers.

718
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:10,263
Hey, baby.

719
00:56:11,673 --> 00:56:14,164
It's okay.
You, shut up.

720
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:17,374
Hey, baby.

721
00:56:18,814 --> 00:56:19,644
Everything's okay.

722
00:56:19,881 --> 00:56:21,746
It's okay.
Don't worry. Don't worry.

723
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,750
Shut up!
Shut up!

724
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:43,835
I have an idea.

725
00:56:44,539 --> 00:56:48,168
Why don't we go to the zoo
or the park, or the museum,

726
00:56:48,243 --> 00:56:49,904
or something?
Just get away.

727
00:56:53,115 --> 00:56:55,140
Are you kidding?
I got, I've, I've...

728
00:56:55,217 --> 00:56:57,310
- Come on.
- I've got meetings till 8:00.

729
00:56:57,386 --> 00:56:58,978
I've presentations to prepare.

730
00:56:59,054 --> 00:57:01,522
Come on.

731
00:57:01,590 --> 00:57:03,490
What, you're
not having fun now?

732
00:57:05,327 --> 00:57:07,386
What have we been doing
for the past few months?

733
00:57:10,098 --> 00:57:12,123
Meeting for lunch.

734
00:57:19,007 --> 00:57:20,531
Let's fuck.

735
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,514
Let's fuck?

736
00:57:28,884 --> 00:57:30,374
Yeah.

737
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,051
Don't you miss loving?

738
00:57:35,957 --> 00:57:40,155
Yeah, yeah, I do, but I...
I can't do this.

739
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:50,535
You know, Jack,
you just don't get it.

740
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:18,697
What's going on?

741
00:58:30,779 --> 00:58:32,041
What time is it?

742
00:58:32,647 --> 00:58:33,705
It's late.

743
00:58:44,226 --> 00:58:46,353
How are you feeling?

744
00:58:46,428 --> 00:58:47,895
What does it matter?

745
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:57,262
Oh, go away.
Go away. Go away.

746
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:02,304
I've got a surprise for you.

747
00:59:04,312 --> 00:59:06,746
What?
What?

748
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:08,908
It's called an amniocentesis.

749
00:59:08,984 --> 00:59:13,250
It tells me if the baby is healthy,
and what sex it is.

750
00:59:13,321 --> 00:59:16,916
I'm just going to remove a
small bit of fluid with this needle.

751
00:59:16,992 --> 00:59:19,460
- No, no, no, no, no.
- It doesn't hurt.

752
00:59:19,528 --> 00:59:21,291
Listen to me.
Listen, Anne...

753
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:22,990
No, it's too late for that, Frank.

754
00:59:23,064 --> 00:59:27,467
It doesn't hurt at all.
You'll just feel a little coldness...

755
00:59:27,536 --> 00:59:31,131
No, no.

756
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:33,936
- Listen...
- I don't want this test, Frank.

757
00:59:36,344 --> 00:59:38,209
I'm going to do the test.

758
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:43,974
The father would like to know
the baby has ten fingers and ten toes.

759
00:59:48,223 --> 00:59:49,747
I'm gonna need you to be
very, very still.

760
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:53,089
You're going to have to force me
because I don't want this test.

761
00:59:59,568 --> 01:00:02,435
- Okay.
- I'm not going to let you do this.

762
01:00:02,504 --> 01:00:05,940
I'm gonna do it,
so don't make it difficult, okay?

763
01:00:06,007 --> 01:00:07,634
I don't wanna hurt the baby.

764
01:00:08,243 --> 01:00:11,110
I just have to do this test,
'cause I have to know.

765
01:00:13,882 --> 01:00:15,509
And then I'll stay here with you...

766
01:00:17,185 --> 01:00:18,812
till you feel better.

767
01:00:21,723 --> 01:00:24,886
I can lay down with you here,
if you want.

768
01:00:26,995 --> 01:00:30,431
Would you like that?
Yes?

769
01:00:33,835 --> 01:00:35,302
I'd like that.

770
01:00:54,356 --> 01:00:56,722
Helen! Helen!

771
01:00:56,791 --> 01:00:59,885
What the hell's going on down there?
You get away from there.

772
01:00:59,961 --> 01:01:02,794
You get away from there,
you stupid bitch.

773
01:01:02,864 --> 01:01:04,024
Get back there.

774
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:06,533
Honey, honey, what happened?

775
01:01:06,601 --> 01:01:08,159
What did she do to you?

776
01:01:09,738 --> 01:01:11,706
You bitch!
You get away from him!

777
01:01:11,773 --> 01:01:13,741
You stay away from him.

778
01:01:26,388 --> 01:01:30,518
You bastard!
You son of a bitch!

779
01:01:30,592 --> 01:01:34,028
This was my baby!
It was my egg! It was my egg!

780
01:01:34,095 --> 01:01:38,998
It was my egg!
It was my egg! It was my egg!

781
01:01:41,970 --> 01:01:45,371
It wasn't your egg.
It wasn't your egg.

782
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:49,200
What?

783
01:01:49,844 --> 01:01:51,471
It wasn't yours.

784
01:02:06,594 --> 01:02:09,461
You bastard! You bastard!
You...

785
01:02:12,734 --> 01:02:16,135
You lied to me!
You fucking bastard!

786
01:02:16,204 --> 01:02:18,069
You bastard!
You bastard!

787
01:02:20,208 --> 01:02:23,268
You bastard!
Bastard!

788
01:02:28,049 --> 01:02:31,951
You bastard!
You bastard!

789
01:02:40,862 --> 01:02:47,665
I just wanted a baby, Frank.
Why couldn't you let me have a baby?

790
01:02:47,736 --> 01:02:49,601
That's all I wanted.

791
01:02:56,811 --> 01:03:00,770
I love you.
Honey...

792
01:03:06,955 --> 01:03:09,389
Keys, keys, keys...

793
01:03:16,331 --> 01:03:18,731
So many keys.

794
01:03:21,402 --> 01:03:23,700
It's this one.

795
01:03:46,828 --> 01:03:50,365
It's gonna be better.

796
01:03:50,365 --> 01:03:55,701
Every day it's gonna be all right.

797
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:59,866
Every day is gonna be better...

798
01:04:16,858 --> 01:04:19,190
...everything

799
01:04:19,260 --> 01:04:21,626
is gonna be all right.

800
01:05:10,979 --> 01:05:13,174
- Anne?
- Yeah?

801
01:05:13,248 --> 01:05:18,083
I have, I brought some sheets
and I brought you a night-gown.

802
01:05:18,152 --> 01:05:21,053
And here, it's your breakfast.

803
01:05:21,623 --> 01:05:24,217
You sure know when it's time to eat.

804
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:27,261
Well, I should.
I'm the one who set your schedule.

805
01:05:27,328 --> 01:05:29,387
It was Frank that didn't follow it.

806
01:05:31,232 --> 01:05:33,564
I've never met
anyone like you, Helen.

807
01:05:35,536 --> 01:05:38,437
Well, there's nobody like me.
That's probably why.

808
01:05:39,474 --> 01:05:44,537
I really think you are going
to make some kind of mother.

809
01:05:47,515 --> 01:05:50,211
- Really?
- Really.

810
01:05:51,452 --> 01:05:55,252
You know what sticks out in my mind
the most about you though?

811
01:05:55,356 --> 01:05:56,755
What?

812
01:05:56,824 --> 01:06:00,988
That you want this baby so badly,

813
01:06:01,062 --> 01:06:04,691
more than anyone could ever imagine.

814
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:10,302
I do.
I really want this baby.

815
01:06:10,405 --> 01:06:15,240
I could... I'm going to love
this baby so much,

816
01:06:15,343 --> 01:06:19,514
I'm just gonna, I'm gonna
take really good care of it.

817
01:06:19,514 --> 01:06:20,606
And this house!

818
01:06:20,715 --> 01:06:22,478
This is a good house for a kid,

819
01:06:22,550 --> 01:06:25,610
'cause there's lots
of little nooks and crannies,

820
01:06:25,687 --> 01:06:28,019
and you can run around,

821
01:06:28,089 --> 01:06:32,253
and I was thinking maybe
to get a dog, name it Gopher.

822
01:06:32,327 --> 01:06:34,295
And we could...
and perhaps get a pony,

823
01:06:34,362 --> 01:06:37,229
but maybe that would
be later on when it was big,

824
01:06:37,298 --> 01:06:40,062
so it didn't fall off
and break its little neck.

825
01:06:40,134 --> 01:06:43,160
I was thinking, I have lots of plans,
lots of, you know,

826
01:06:43,237 --> 01:06:47,901
but first I want to make
sure the baby's happy...

827
01:06:48,009 --> 01:06:49,636
just being a baby in the crib.

828
01:06:52,146 --> 01:06:53,135
Good.

829
01:06:54,582 --> 01:06:56,675
Can I tell you something else?

830
01:06:56,751 --> 01:06:58,275
What?

831
01:07:02,390 --> 01:07:04,255
I think it's gonna be a boy.

832
01:07:07,395 --> 01:07:09,022
What?

833
01:07:09,764 --> 01:07:11,857
A little boy?

834
01:07:11,966 --> 01:07:13,695
- How do you know?
- I think.

835
01:07:13,768 --> 01:07:16,703
Is it like,
how it kicks inside the womb,

836
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:20,332
and is it really aggressive?
Or...

837
01:07:20,408 --> 01:07:22,342
A mother just knows, right?

838
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:25,538
You just know.
A little boy!

839
01:07:25,646 --> 01:07:30,447
I'll call it Joey. Or Brandon.
I'll call it,

840
01:07:30,518 --> 01:07:32,850
I don't know.
I have to think about it.

841
01:07:34,956 --> 01:07:36,218
Anne?

842
01:07:38,459 --> 01:07:41,292
I'll be back down at lunchtime.

843
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:50,634
A boy!
A boy!

844
01:07:51,939 --> 01:07:54,271
A boy!

845
01:08:15,897 --> 01:08:18,991
Anne?
Anne?

846
01:08:19,067 --> 01:08:21,865
Anne?
Oh, my God!

847
01:08:21,936 --> 01:08:24,905
What happened to you, Anne?
What happened?

848
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:27,372
Get up.
Oh, my. Come on, Anne.

849
01:08:27,475 --> 01:08:29,670
Get up, all right?
Here, you're gonna be fine.

850
01:08:29,744 --> 01:08:32,372
Everything's gonna be fine.
All right.

851
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:34,141
You really shouldn't
be so clumsy, you know?

852
01:08:34,215 --> 01:08:36,240
You're not just walking for one.

853
01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:40,754
Ahh! The baby! It hurts!

854
01:08:43,257 --> 01:08:45,452
Right here?
Where? Here?

855
01:08:47,361 --> 01:08:50,455
All right. I'll just,
I'm gonna, uh, I'll get, I'll...

856
01:08:51,265 --> 01:08:54,962
Okay. I'm going to call
for a doctor, all right?

857
01:08:55,036 --> 01:08:59,166
You stay right here.
Don't move.

858
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,615
He's here.

859
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:21,822
Now, Anne, I'm sure you understand
this is a very tricky situation.

860
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:25,133
It's very important there
be no talking of any kind.

861
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:26,464
You understand me?

862
01:09:32,573 --> 01:09:35,406
I know how you hate
when I give you the hypodermic...

863
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:38,570
but I can't take
any unnecessary risks.

864
01:09:38,646 --> 01:09:40,637
I don't need anymore.
I'm your friend...

865
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:42,340
Anne, I can't trust you.
I'm sorry.

866
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:44,111
Yes, you can.
I'm your...

867
01:09:49,090 --> 01:09:51,425
Hi, you must be the doctor.
Come on in.

868
01:09:51,425 --> 01:09:53,154
Thank you very much.

869
01:09:53,227 --> 01:09:56,458
I'm really glad to see you.
Can I take your coat?

870
01:09:56,531 --> 01:09:58,226
- Oh, thank you.
- So what was your name again?

871
01:09:58,299 --> 01:09:59,061
- Gardner.
- Oh, Gardner.

872
01:09:59,133 --> 01:10:02,762
I'm sorry I didn't hear that.
So glad to see you.

873
01:10:02,837 --> 01:10:04,828
It's kind of an emergency.

874
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:06,702
You seem awfully healthy.

875
01:10:07,008 --> 01:10:08,942
Oh, no.

876
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:11,501
Nah, it's not for me.
It's for my sister.

877
01:10:11,612 --> 01:10:12,977
She's upstairs.
She's in bed.

878
01:10:13,047 --> 01:10:14,981
She's incapacitated.

879
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:22,717
- What's her name?
- Susan.

880
01:10:23,925 --> 01:10:30,023
- Susan... wake up.
- She won't wake up, doctor.

881
01:10:30,097 --> 01:10:32,827
She took a painkiller earlier.
She insisted.

882
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,891
She's a very headstrong girl.

883
01:10:34,969 --> 01:10:37,130
- What's she on?
- Demerol.

884
01:10:37,205 --> 01:10:39,173
It shouldn't
put her out like this.

885
01:10:39,240 --> 01:10:41,765
So I don't know maybe that affected
her stomach a little bit,

886
01:10:41,842 --> 01:10:43,867
perhaps you should
check it out.

887
01:10:44,212 --> 01:10:46,772
Pull her blankets back.
I'll listen to her vitals.

888
01:10:46,881 --> 01:10:48,473
Okay.

889
01:11:00,127 --> 01:11:03,824
- Ma'am?
- You know, I was just thinking...

890
01:11:04,632 --> 01:11:08,269
Perhaps it's better you don't
do a whole thorough examination.

891
01:11:08,269 --> 01:11:10,567
You see,
we don't have medical insurance

892
01:11:10,705 --> 01:11:12,773
and we won't be able
to pay you for the bill.

893
01:11:12,773 --> 01:11:15,469
Don't worry, there'll be no charge.
Excuse me...

894
01:11:15,543 --> 01:11:17,306
Aren't you nice?

895
01:11:38,366 --> 01:11:41,767
So... you hear anything?

896
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:47,568
Did she have any
symptoms before her fall?

897
01:11:47,808 --> 01:11:50,538
No, no symptoms at all.

898
01:11:50,645 --> 01:11:52,943
As a matter of fact, doctor,
between you and me,

899
01:11:53,014 --> 01:11:55,380
I think she might be
faking it a little bit.

900
01:11:55,449 --> 01:11:57,747
You see,
she's kind of a hypochondriac.

901
01:11:57,818 --> 01:12:01,219
I am very concerned
about her stomach.

902
01:12:01,289 --> 01:12:03,849
Oh, no, doctor.
I think it's very important...

903
01:12:03,924 --> 01:12:06,085
that you don't
examine her stomach.

904
01:12:06,193 --> 01:12:11,221
You see, she had a nasty
botched Caesarian a few years ago,

905
01:12:11,332 --> 01:12:15,336
and she's very sensitive
about anybody seeing the scarring.

906
01:12:15,336 --> 01:12:17,065
I know she's unconscious,
but I think it would be...

907
01:12:17,171 --> 01:12:19,571
a violation of her personal
rights if you were...

908
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:23,132
to peel back her clothing
and look at the most intimate,

909
01:12:23,244 --> 01:12:25,508
disgusting part of her body.

910
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:27,711
Oh, here she comes.

911
01:12:30,318 --> 01:12:31,546
What?

912
01:12:34,088 --> 01:12:35,919
I can't hear you, Susan.

913
01:12:36,057 --> 01:12:38,355
I don't think she's
really saying anything.

914
01:12:38,426 --> 01:12:40,360
You've got to tell me where.

915
01:12:40,494 --> 01:12:42,519
That's enough, doctor!

916
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,832
I think that...

917
01:12:48,369 --> 01:12:51,532
Excuse me, I'm going to get that.

918
01:12:52,406 --> 01:12:54,237
Excuse me, one second.

919
01:12:57,812 --> 01:13:01,441
Hello?
Yeah, it's...

920
01:13:01,549 --> 01:13:04,017
No, no,
Frank isn't here, he's gone.

921
01:13:04,085 --> 01:13:07,418
A family emergency.
Look, I really can't talk right now.

922
01:13:08,055 --> 01:13:10,148
Yes, goodbye, doctor.

923
01:13:10,925 --> 01:13:12,358
Great news!
That was her doctor!

924
01:13:12,426 --> 01:13:15,259
Her real doctor.
He's on his way over here right now.

925
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:17,058
He'll be here in ten minutes.

926
01:13:17,565 --> 01:13:21,001
I really, really, really
appreciate your coming out.

927
01:13:21,102 --> 01:13:22,694
It's very, very,
very kind of you.

928
01:13:22,803 --> 01:13:24,464
- What was her doctor's name?
- Benton.

929
01:13:24,538 --> 01:13:26,836
- Benton?
- No, it's Smith.

930
01:13:26,907 --> 01:13:27,896
I'm bad at names.

931
01:13:30,244 --> 01:13:32,838
Listen, I don't mean
to sound inconsiderate, but...

932
01:13:32,947 --> 01:13:35,040
You don't sound inconsiderate.
Believe me.

933
01:13:35,116 --> 01:13:37,983
- Your sister should have X-rays.
- I understand that, doctor.

934
01:13:38,052 --> 01:13:39,519
She might have a concussion.

935
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,884
Yes, I understand you took
some kind of Hippocratic oath

936
01:13:41,956 --> 01:13:44,117
and you feel it's your
duty to take care of my sister,

937
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,751
but I really think you should go now.
Thank you very much.

938
01:13:46,861 --> 01:13:50,024
- But...
- Thank you, thank you. Goodbye.

939
01:13:58,305 --> 01:14:00,671
So, we're back, are we?

940
01:14:00,875 --> 01:14:03,469
Back to something
you're familiar with.

941
01:14:03,577 --> 01:14:07,138
What's the matter, Anne?
Too many drugs for you?

942
01:14:07,214 --> 01:14:10,206
As you know, Anne, we have
many rules in this household,

943
01:14:10,284 --> 01:14:13,617
and no fucking
secret messages is one of them.

944
01:14:14,955 --> 01:14:17,788
You got that?
Does that sink in?

945
01:14:17,925 --> 01:14:21,462
No notes, no messages.
Answer me!

946
01:14:21,462 --> 01:14:24,898
Answer me!

947
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,428
Fuck off!

948
01:14:27,735 --> 01:14:30,795
Bitch!
Mother fucker!

949
01:14:31,872 --> 01:14:33,965
After all I've done for you!

950
01:14:40,047 --> 01:14:42,515
Have you ever heard
of a Caesarian, Anne?

951
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:47,610
I think I could do that.
What do you think?

952
01:14:47,688 --> 01:14:52,557
Of course, I'm not a skilled physician
like the dearly departed Frank,

953
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:55,754
but I do have very sharp scissors.

954
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:58,252
Frank?

955
01:18:31,145 --> 01:18:33,773
Anne!

956
01:18:47,394 --> 01:18:48,622
Hello!

957
01:18:52,266 --> 01:18:55,565
Hello, anybody in there?

958
01:19:24,231 --> 01:19:28,429
Okay, be home. Be home.

959
01:19:50,224 --> 01:19:52,624
I'm not in right now, if you leave
your name and your number

960
01:19:52,693 --> 01:19:55,662
I'll call you back as soon as I can.
Thanks. Bye

961
01:19:56,363 --> 01:19:59,127
Jack, Jack, are you there?

962
01:20:01,034 --> 01:20:06,563
Pick up the phone.
Jack, please, pick up the phone.

963
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:11,441
It's Anne.
Jack, I need you.

964
01:20:11,545 --> 01:20:14,105
Please pick up the phone.

965
01:20:14,748 --> 01:20:18,445
I need your help.
I need you to come and get me.

966
01:20:21,755 --> 01:20:24,815
Jack... Jack...

967
01:20:24,892 --> 01:20:27,588
Jack, pick up the phone.

968
01:20:27,661 --> 01:20:29,856
Please... pick up the phone.

969
01:20:31,598 --> 01:20:34,897
Please, pick up the phone.
I'm in the country somewhere...

970
01:20:36,336 --> 01:20:37,701
Who is this?

971
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:41,468
Jack!
Jack, Jack!

972
01:20:41,542 --> 01:20:43,669
This is a sick joke.
Who is this?

973
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:49,046
It's your wife.
Jack, it's me, please...

974
01:20:49,116 --> 01:20:51,016
Jack, it's Anne.

975
01:20:54,555 --> 01:20:56,147
What?

976
01:20:56,223 --> 01:20:58,020
It's Anne.

977
01:20:58,725 --> 01:21:00,920
- Anne?
- Yes.

978
01:21:00,994 --> 01:21:03,588
It's me.
I need you...

979
01:21:03,664 --> 01:21:05,427
I need you to help me out.

980
01:21:05,499 --> 01:21:07,592
I'm in the middle of
the country somewhere and I don't...

981
01:21:07,668 --> 01:21:10,398
I've been kidnapped.

982
01:21:10,470 --> 01:21:12,233
Oh, my God!
Where are you?

983
01:21:12,773 --> 01:21:16,209
By a road.
I'm in a phone booth...

984
01:21:16,310 --> 01:21:19,074
There's no phone book.

985
01:21:19,146 --> 01:21:22,377
Oh, okay, wait,
I'm at, I'm at 555..

986
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:26,715
- Oh, Jesus!
- There's tractors.

987
01:21:26,787 --> 01:21:28,084
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

988
01:21:28,155 --> 01:21:30,419
There's a farmhouse.
I've been in it.

989
01:21:32,159 --> 01:21:32,955
Okay.

990
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:36,193
- Okay, it's uh...
- The number, honey, the number.

991
01:21:40,133 --> 01:21:44,934
It's 555-0194.

992
01:21:45,038 --> 01:21:48,599
555-0194.
Please come and get me.

993
01:21:48,675 --> 01:21:51,769
Okay, listen.
You call the cops right now.

994
01:21:51,879 --> 01:21:54,143
Call 911 right now.
They'll be able to get there right away.

995
01:21:54,248 --> 01:21:56,716
Anne!

996
01:22:08,295 --> 01:22:10,024
What's going on?
Anne!

997
01:22:10,631 --> 01:22:14,260
Anne! Anne!

998
01:22:14,334 --> 01:22:15,801
Anne!

999
01:22:24,711 --> 01:22:27,475
Come to mama!

1000
01:22:29,783 --> 01:22:32,980
Anne, where are you?

1001
01:22:35,489 --> 01:22:37,753
Anne!
Anne!

1002
01:22:37,991 --> 01:22:39,982
Anne, wait, wait.

1003
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,994
Wait!
Wait!

1004
01:22:45,999 --> 01:22:46,966
Wait!

1005
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:49,830
Anne, wait!
Wait!

1006
01:22:49,903 --> 01:22:52,064
Wait!
Anne!

1007
01:22:55,943 --> 01:22:58,571
Stop!
I said stop!

1008
01:22:58,679 --> 01:22:59,668
Stop!

1009
01:22:59,780 --> 01:23:01,941
Stop!
You're making me mad.

1010
01:23:03,483 --> 01:23:04,780
Bitch!

1011
01:23:07,788 --> 01:23:09,483
Don't make me mad!

1012
01:23:15,762 --> 01:23:17,730
No, fuck that!
You calm down!

1013
01:23:17,798 --> 01:23:20,426
She's not dead,
for Christ's sake!

1014
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:23,359
She... listen to me...

1015
01:23:23,437 --> 01:23:24,836
God damn you!

1016
01:23:29,242 --> 01:23:32,234
Come to mama.

1017
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:40,479
Anne, where are you?

1018
01:23:48,495 --> 01:23:50,429
You psycho bitch!

1019
01:23:53,934 --> 01:23:56,266
Oh, you bitch!
You bitch!

1020
01:24:22,929 --> 01:24:26,296
Wait! Stop!
No, stop, stop.

1021
01:24:26,366 --> 01:24:28,095
Please, help.
Help!

1022
01:24:29,636 --> 01:24:31,763
No!

1023
01:25:22,923 --> 01:25:24,754
What the hell?

1024
01:25:37,737 --> 01:25:40,205
Where is she?
You got her?

1025
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:45,400
Well, someone smashed
up the phone booth all right.

1026
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:49,009
- You haven't got her?
- Well...

1027
01:25:49,082 --> 01:25:52,518
Someone may have already
given her a lift somewhere...

1028
01:25:52,586 --> 01:25:54,281
- Maybe...
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

1029
01:25:54,387 --> 01:25:57,845
Maybe just some kids.
All the officers have her description.

1030
01:26:00,026 --> 01:26:01,755
What do you want me to do?

1031
01:26:02,129 --> 01:26:04,620
Officer Williams,
report to dispatch.

1032
01:26:04,698 --> 01:26:06,290
I'm on my way.

1033
01:27:50,403 --> 01:27:53,702
Come to mama!

1034
01:27:53,873 --> 01:27:57,070
Anne, where are you?

1035
01:27:58,645 --> 01:28:02,411
Come, little birdie.

1036
01:28:02,916 --> 01:28:06,010
Where are you?

1037
01:28:12,592 --> 01:28:14,253
Any improvements yet, Karen?

1038
01:28:14,327 --> 01:28:17,296
Well, her heart rate's
picked up a bit, but not much.

1039
01:28:17,397 --> 01:28:18,887
Okay, thanks.

1040
01:28:25,438 --> 01:28:28,066
What is your story, my friend?

1041
01:28:28,174 --> 01:28:30,301
Curious sensitive fella, ain't you?

1042
01:28:35,582 --> 01:28:36,981
Oh, come on, doctor.
Get off the bed.

1043
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,847
It's highly unprofessional.

1044
01:28:39,519 --> 01:28:42,784
Good news, Anne.
We're checking out early.

1045
01:28:51,031 --> 01:28:53,056
I'm turning the light on now.

1046
01:28:57,270 --> 01:29:01,001
Anne!
I have a surprise for you!

1047
01:29:01,107 --> 01:29:02,540
Come on, Anne.

1048
01:29:02,609 --> 01:29:06,272
I have a birthing day
surprise for you.

1049
01:29:06,379 --> 01:29:08,404
You have a visitor.

1050
01:29:09,115 --> 01:29:12,573
Wake up, asshole.
Wake up.

1051
01:29:13,887 --> 01:29:16,253
Don't you recognize him?
Look!

1052
01:29:16,323 --> 01:29:17,517
It's Jack!

1053
01:29:17,624 --> 01:29:18,852
What?

1054
01:29:18,925 --> 01:29:21,553
I thought you said
he was good looking.

1055
01:29:30,904 --> 01:29:33,372
God, what an annoying voice!

1056
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,907
Jack, are you all right?

1057
01:29:38,978 --> 01:29:40,878
Jack, can you hear me?

1058
01:29:40,947 --> 01:29:44,383
Jack, can you hear her?
You should answer her, Jack.

1059
01:29:44,484 --> 01:29:47,920
Communication is very
important in a marriage.

1060
01:29:47,987 --> 01:29:49,352
Come on, Jack.

1061
01:29:49,422 --> 01:29:54,155
I'm fine, dearie.

1062
01:29:58,264 --> 01:30:00,664
Why don't you stop?

1063
01:30:00,734 --> 01:30:02,634
I could have killed him.
I was gonna kill him.

1064
01:30:02,702 --> 01:30:05,000
But then I had a thought.

1065
01:30:05,071 --> 01:30:07,335
I thought,
"maybe it will comfort Anne

1066
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:10,501
to have her husband
around for the big moment."

1067
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:14,273
You know what my motto is:
"Whatever is best for the baby."

1068
01:30:15,348 --> 01:30:17,441
Oh, I have something
else I want to show you.

1069
01:30:19,219 --> 01:30:21,278
Look here. Look what I did!

1070
01:30:21,388 --> 01:30:23,151
Look, look.
Look!

1071
01:30:25,892 --> 01:30:29,623
See? I came downstairs
when you were asleep...

1072
01:30:29,729 --> 01:30:32,892
and I was gonna cut the baby out.
And I could have too.

1073
01:30:32,966 --> 01:30:35,491
Except for, when I started,

1074
01:30:35,568 --> 01:30:37,763
I thought I heard
my baby crying out.

1075
01:30:38,071 --> 01:30:41,040
"No, mommy, no.
You'll put out my eye."

1076
01:30:41,541 --> 01:30:45,875
I almost hurt my baby trying to
get it out of your disgusting body.

1077
01:30:47,180 --> 01:30:50,616
But then, all of a sudden,
the contractions started,

1078
01:30:50,683 --> 01:30:55,484
and I thought to myself,
"Helen, just wait.

1079
01:30:55,555 --> 01:30:57,921
It's not gonna be long now.
You can wait."

1080
01:30:58,892 --> 01:31:02,157
You know?
It's just a matter of time.

1081
01:31:02,228 --> 01:31:04,788
And I've got plenty of time.

1082
01:31:06,599 --> 01:31:09,033
The waiting game, huh, Anne?

1083
01:31:11,171 --> 01:31:14,902
Oh-oh.
Blow, Anne. Blow.

1084
01:31:15,008 --> 01:31:16,942
Blow. Blow. Blow.

1085
01:31:17,043 --> 01:31:18,874
Breathe, Anne. Blow.

1086
01:31:18,945 --> 01:31:21,004
Blow. Blow.

1087
01:31:21,080 --> 01:31:22,707
Fuck you!

1088
01:31:23,817 --> 01:31:25,614
See?

1089
01:31:25,685 --> 01:31:28,916
It won't be long
until I separate you from my baby,

1090
01:31:28,988 --> 01:31:31,115
and then, after that...

1091
01:31:34,194 --> 01:31:36,628
Goodbye, useless tissue matter.

1092
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:38,347
Oh! Oh, no!

1093
01:32:38,424 --> 01:32:40,119
Oh, shit!

1094
01:32:41,127 --> 01:32:42,958
This could be it.

1095
01:32:43,029 --> 01:32:46,726
All right, calm down,
don't get all hysterical.

1096
01:32:46,799 --> 01:32:48,926
The baby's not going
to pop out all of a sudden.

1097
01:32:50,003 --> 01:32:51,334
All right, all right.

1098
01:32:51,404 --> 01:32:54,541
- It's coming out.
- Just breathe.

1099
01:32:54,541 --> 01:32:56,304
Push, push.

1100
01:32:56,409 --> 01:32:59,071
Oh, Jesus.
How did you do that?

1101
01:32:59,145 --> 01:33:02,046
All right, settle down.
You're not helping me here.

1102
01:33:02,115 --> 01:33:04,049
Push, push.

1103
01:33:04,117 --> 01:33:05,311
Push, you lazy bitch.

1104
01:33:13,226 --> 01:33:15,387
God damn you!
You fucking bitch!

1105
01:33:15,461 --> 01:33:17,019
You psycho bitch!

1106
01:33:17,096 --> 01:33:20,327
You drop it!
You drop it!

1107
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:21,833
You drop...
Anne!

1108
01:33:21,901 --> 01:33:25,029
Anne, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1109
01:33:25,104 --> 01:33:26,196
What are you doing?

1110
01:33:26,272 --> 01:33:29,173
I'm gonna kill myself
and I'm gonna kill the baby too.

1111
01:33:29,275 --> 01:33:33,211
No. Anne, no.
Don't do that.

1112
01:33:33,313 --> 01:33:34,803
It's a little baby.

1113
01:33:36,082 --> 01:33:37,811
Drop it, or I'll kill Jack!

1114
01:33:37,917 --> 01:33:39,714
If you want this baby, drop the gun.

1115
01:33:39,786 --> 01:33:41,219
I'll kill your yuppie husband.

1116
01:33:41,287 --> 01:33:43,687
Drop the fucking gun.

1117
01:33:43,756 --> 01:33:47,283
All right, Anne.
Anne, Anne, I'm...

1118
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,760
Okay, Anne.
Okay. Okay.

1119
01:33:49,829 --> 01:33:50,989
All right.
You got your way.

1120
01:33:51,064 --> 01:33:55,694
- Look, look, Anne, look.
- Put it down.

1121
01:33:55,768 --> 01:33:57,759
I'm putting it down.
Are you looking?

1122
01:33:57,837 --> 01:34:00,533
I'm going to put it down.
Look, Anne, be careful.

1123
01:34:00,607 --> 01:34:03,167
I'm putting it down.
Here goes.

1124
01:34:03,276 --> 01:34:07,178
Down on the floor.
I'm putting it down.

1125
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,475
Look, it's on the floor.

1126
01:34:09,549 --> 01:34:12,814
Look, Anne, look.
I'm putting it down.

1127
01:34:12,885 --> 01:34:15,649
Look.
All right.

1128
01:34:15,722 --> 01:34:18,213
- Down on the floor.
- You bitch!

1129
01:34:22,962 --> 01:34:25,556
Bitch. You little bitch.

1130
01:35:00,433 --> 01:35:02,492
Die! Die!

1131
01:35:02,568 --> 01:35:04,160
You fucking bitch!

1132
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:37,293
I wanna walk.
I wanna walk.

1133
01:36:45,538 --> 01:36:50,942
We're okay.
We're okay, sweetie.

1134
01:36:52,545 --> 01:36:53,739
Jack.

1135
01:36:55,348 --> 01:36:56,713
Jack.

1136
01:37:08,394 --> 01:37:10,919
Jack.
Oh, Jack.

1137
