1
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,072
The path to Paradise...

2
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,449
is full of obstacles.

3
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:37,384
Amazing discovery made by the Stanford
Research Institute

4
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:38,719
in the Plain of Giza.

5
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:42,723
The big pyramid and the Sphynx
are connected by a secret passage.

6
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:55,361
"Upuaut VII" the micro-robot created by
the German engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink

7
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,657
has discovered some subterranean caves
connecting these two huge structures.

8
00:04:04,036 --> 00:04:07,414
Hieroglyphic fragments suggest
that the subterranean structures

9
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,792
were created by the "Shemsu Hor":

10
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:13,504
the followers of a cult devoted to
the legendary Horus.

11
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,799
We are about to discover
the mythical "Way of Horus".

12
00:04:17,508 --> 00:04:19,677
Here are the images,
shown for the first time.

13
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,824
The ancient Egyptians were already using
an instrument like this one

14
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:46,203
to orient themselves in the desert
by following the stars.

15
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,959
It was rediscovered thanks to
an old scroll...

16
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:57,298
Remember: Every single thing around you
is part of the whole picture...

17
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,967
Everything is connected
by an invisible thread...

18
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,846
You just need to be able
to see the connections.

19
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:18,193
We'll find right here the relics
of the Egyptian ships coasting Italy.

20
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:23,198
Phaeton will no longer be a myth.
We can prove it!

21
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,827
Ab“, here we are.

22
00:06:03,155 --> 00:06:05,115
Hello?

23
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:07,284
I found it.
Here's almost dawn.

24
00:06:08,285 --> 00:06:12,039
I'll send it to you via pneumatic
tube“.

25
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,377
Hello!

26
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:24,051
What's happening?

27
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:26,303
Someone's here. I have to go.

28
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:55,476
Assistant director, someone is asking
for you on the phone.

29
00:07:55,601 --> 00:07:59,897
Fine. The four canopic jars
of Horus from New York

30
00:08:00,022 --> 00:08:03,150
need to be placed
in the showcase number 33.

31
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,402
All right, Dr. Tule.

32
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:10,616
Hello?

33
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,535
Yes, I'm coming.

34
00:08:14,536 --> 00:08:16,288
Something unexpected!

35
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:20,292
Please, tell Professor Al Kamar
I need to go.

36
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,920
Don't worry, Doctor. I'll tell him.

37
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:36,767
Welcome to the eternal life.

38
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:41,021
The borders of existence
will be definitely overcome.

39
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,072
Your precious signature, please.

40
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:57,454
Bye.

41
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:28,819
Death and Nature will be astounded,

42
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,990
when every creature will revive

43
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:36,743
to answer the Judgement.

44
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,247
The soul longing for eternity,

45
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:46,128
needs to overcome the invincible
triumph of death

46
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:50,215
in order to be saved.

47
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:54,344
The borders of existence

48
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,723
will be definitely overcome.

49
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,772
Go beyond the threshold of hope.

50
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,528
Experience it!

51
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:18,118
Resurrection Day is coming,

52
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,914
when the half-living of the Moratorium

53
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,292
will live again.

54
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,671
We are waiting for you.

55
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:35,302
Resurrection Day is coming.

56
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,266
Offers are subject to the availability,

57
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:43,810
terms and conditions
of every single structure.

58
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,897
Facilitations cannot be discussed
outside estimate's phase.

59
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,566
Payments are not commutable
in foreign bonds.

60
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,152
Lot 514!

61
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,782
The starting bid is of 10.000
post-credits, non-commutable into bonds.

62
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,164
Other offers?

63
00:11:11,713 --> 00:11:14,091
Lot 515, now.

64
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:18,929
Some rare fragments of an Egyptian
scroll: the date is uncertain.

65
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:23,100
They come from a private collection,
but are certified by our experts.

66
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,104
Bid starts from 50.000 post-credits,
non-commutable into bonds.

67
00:11:27,604 --> 00:11:30,857
Bids must be of 10.000 post-credits
for the exposed code.

68
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,610
Ladies and gentlemen, we can start.

69
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:36,863
Who offers more?

70
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:40,242
60.000 post-credits for the gentleman
with paddle number 3.

71
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,704
70.000 post-credits for the lady
with paddle number 5.

72
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,374
80.000 post-credits for the gentleman,
with paddle number 8.

73
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,751
More?

74
00:11:50,001 --> 00:11:53,755
90.000 post-credits for the gentleman,
with paddle number 15.

75
00:11:55,966 --> 00:12:00,011
100.000 post-credits to the gentleman,
with paddle number 3.

76
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,389
No more bids?

77
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:05,767
100.000 and one.

78
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:08,019
100.000 and two.

79
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,605
100.000 and three!

80
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:13,900
The item is awarded to the gentleman,
with paddle number 3.

81
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,903
Thank you and congratulations, sir.
It's an excellent choice!

82
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:25,370
We carry on, with lot 516.

83
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:35,672
The third canto of the Divine Comedy
of the great poet Dante Alighieri!

84
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:38,425
A volume dated the end
of the nineteenth century.

85
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,888
The starting bid to experience
Dante's Paradise is...

86
00:12:47,517 --> 00:12:48,810
Scan the pictures.

87
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:54,149
Make two encrypted copies:
one for me and one for the institute,

88
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:55,650
and then...

89
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:59,196
you can remove a tiny fragment for DNA

90
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,282
and radiocarbon testing.

91
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,785
I want to know where this came from.

92
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:08,538
Well, it looks like
Cyperus Papyrus, Professor.

93
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:11,833
But the test will take a least a week.

94
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,668
We can wait.

95
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:15,837
You can do these scans.

96
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:18,715
I'm going to make a few phone calls
and...

97
00:13:19,591 --> 00:13:22,344
I want to visit one of my true
colleagues.

98
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,980
We got the results today.

99
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:39,319
This is part of the Turin Canon.

100
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,198
Unfortunately, the most important part
is missing.

101
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,368
That could be a connection to
the Seven Sages.

102
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,496
The Book of the Foundation.

103
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,748
The followers of Horus.

104
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:54,334
The builders of the sacred cities.

105
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,004
That's just amazing.

106
00:13:58,129 --> 00:13:59,256
Yeah.

107
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:13,353
You must have paid a fortune for
these...

108
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:16,898
You even got them past the Shuster
Control.

109
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,360
It's damn fantastic!

110
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:28,743
Dante, these days everything is
just a flow of digital data

111
00:14:28,785 --> 00:14:30,662
one click away.

112
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:34,541
Not even Oligarchs could afford
these relics of the past.

113
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,919
It's just a partial fortune, sadly.
Let's sit.

114
00:14:46,052 --> 00:14:47,679
I used to smoke.

115
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,186
That's the only thing my Father left me.

116
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:00,400
It's the only real thing beside
all these memories.

117
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,529
Funny, isn't it?
Today it's a totally useless object.

118
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,199
Another vanish utopia.

119
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:10,577
Yes.

120
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,789
I want to get to that missing piece.

121
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:19,210
Maybe was misfiled in
some different document.

122
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,296
You could go to Turin.

123
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,465
To check the catalogues!

124
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,468
I can't leave my mother.

125
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:29,721
Yes, I know she needs you.

126
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,599
I love her, too.

127
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:34,726
She's not getting better.

128
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,979
We can wait, don't be long.

129
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,483
All right?

130
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,609
Gk.

131
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,697
You may need help.

132
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:50,575
No, I prefer to dive alone.
You know me.

133
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:08,385
- Here, this is the point.
- Yes, I see.

134
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,269
Look, this is your father.

135
00:16:36,246 --> 00:16:38,790
What's happening?

136
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:44,671
- Shit...
- What?

137
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,382
He's coming up too fast.

138
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,677
Are you ok?

139
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:44,856
Follow your heart...

140
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:51,112
The light of your most brilliant star...

141
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:54,574
will lead you to the roots...

142
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,618
to the Truth...

143
00:17:58,369 --> 00:18:01,581
There lies the secret...

144
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,419
She never wanted to end up in a
Moratorium,

145
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:51,756
bound to a thermic decay-suspension
machine.

146
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,509
Hanging between life and death.

147
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:58,429
Lingering in that bubble,
just to be able to talk to her

148
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,431
for a couple of minutes a year.

149
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:07,689
And death...

150
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,525
shall have no dominion.

151
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:16,030
Dead man naked they shall be one

152
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,202
with the man in the wind and the west
moon.

153
00:19:21,286 --> 00:19:24,164
When their bones are picked clean

154
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,207
and the clean bones gone,

155
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:29,335
they shall have stars at elbow and foot.

156
00:19:31,713 --> 00:19:35,425
Though they sink through the sea
they shall rise again.

157
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,554
Though lovers be lost

158
00:19:39,596 --> 00:19:42,056
love shall not.

159
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:44,684
And death...

160
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,978
shall have no dominion.

161
00:19:55,737 --> 00:19:58,489
Welcome to the eternal life.

162
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:08,208
Resurrection Day is coming.

163
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:15,590
When every creature will revive
to answer the Judgement.

164
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,135
It's time to wake up.

165
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:22,138
I'm Mr. Adams.
I'm looking for Mr. Shu.

166
00:20:25,225 --> 00:20:28,478
The references from Prof. Moonlight
grants you the necessary authorization.

167
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:32,732
You are now a "root user" of our system.
A big privilege, no doubt.

168
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:34,859
But...

169
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,655
Actually, we've not been informed
about the object of your research.

170
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,408
I'm looking for information
about the movements of

171
00:20:42,533 --> 00:20:46,746
some fragments of an ancient scroll...
connected to the Turin Canon.

172
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:49,624
You can find the coordinates in my
badge.

173
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:51,292
Good, Professor Adams,

174
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:54,295
I'm going to make a quick research
in the digital archives.

175
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:56,881
- In the meantime, could you please...
- Sure.

176
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:03,429
Excellent! Thank you sir.

177
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,556
Thank you.

178
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,434
Let me see...

179
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,192
No, that's really strange though.

180
00:21:18,069 --> 00:21:20,697
Maybe the notification is missing.

181
00:21:22,949 --> 00:21:26,077
Ok don't worry, no problem.

182
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:29,289
We could try some information
in the paper archives.

183
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,208
- Could you please wait here?
- For sure, no problem.

184
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,838
According to the Shuster law,
in order to...

185
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:40,842
to get access to the archive, you need
an authorization from the Ministry.

186
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:45,596
Your references are not enough.
You understand?

187
00:21:46,431 --> 00:21:50,184
You could try talking to
the former director,

188
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,729
Professor Fahrid Al Kamar:

189
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:55,606
he knew the content of the museum
piece by piece.

190
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,484
He spent his life among papers and
papers.

191
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:01,738
I know he lives in a small
village not far from here.

192
00:22:02,447 --> 00:22:03,489
Good morning,

193
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:05,616
I'm looking for Professor Al Kamar.

194
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:07,952
Do you know him?

195
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:09,871
I am a researcher.

196
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,000
The Egyptian Museum of Turin sent me
here.

197
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,336
You are a colleague, then...

198
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:20,757
You go out of the shop and
turn right into the small alley.

199
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:24,260
After fifty meters you'll find an arch.

200
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:27,847
The Professor's house gate is right
there.

201
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:29,640
Thank you, sir.

202
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:59,170
You're not going to find him
there though now.

203
00:22:59,253 --> 00:23:02,673
He spends all his time
inside a cave in the woods.

204
00:23:03,257 --> 00:23:04,634
It's not far from here.

205
00:25:07,048 --> 00:25:08,132
No.

206
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:13,304
It's impossible...

207
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,390
No, father wake up.

208
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,895
Wake up! Father!

209
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:23,689
No, do not leave me alone...

210
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,822
Let me stay here... Father!

211
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:34,825
Father!

212
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,077
No!

213
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,705
Father!

214
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,961
I want to see my father!

215
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,428
Father!

216
00:25:55,805 --> 00:25:57,348
Father!

217
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:21,622
Rest in peace, my friend.

218
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:42,912
Eh“.!

219
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:44,580
Who are you?

220
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:47,458
Don't worry, Professor. I'm Arthur
Adams.

221
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,210
I am an archeologist from York.

222
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:51,337
What do you want?

223
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,298
I'm Professor Moonlight's assistant.
You should know him.

224
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,549
Moonlight?

225
00:27:56,467 --> 00:27:57,802
Professor Al Kamar?

226
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:58,928
Yes...

227
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:01,555
so they say.

228
00:28:02,098 --> 00:28:04,225
I'm doing some researches
on an ancient document.

229
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,727
You are the only one who can help me.

230
00:28:10,064 --> 00:28:11,565
Which document?

231
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:14,360
The missing fragment
of the Turin Canon!

232
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:20,866
It's not so easy.

233
00:28:21,242 --> 00:28:23,452
Not here... not now.

234
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:28,499
Meet me at San Lorenzo's church.
At sunset.

235
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,627
You must go now, boy.

236
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,087
Go!

237
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,685
Ah, you're here, already!

238
00:29:29,769 --> 00:29:31,312
What's going on?

239
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:34,064
Listen to me, boy.
This is very important:

240
00:29:34,148 --> 00:29:38,694
the place where we met is the tomb
of an ancient Egyptian queen.

241
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,821
These walls...

242
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:43,824
gives us clues for understanding
the scroll you're looking for.

243
00:29:44,575 --> 00:29:46,952
Look over there,
do you see those roses?

244
00:29:48,162 --> 00:29:51,957
The corn, Hermes... even the Pelican,
too.

245
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:56,712
These stones tell us that this place
was once an ancient Egyptian site,

246
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:59,423
linked to the cult of Horus.

247
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:01,842
Yes... but what about the scroll?

248
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:04,720
Another time.

249
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,864
Professor Al Kamar?

250
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:28,244
It's Arthur Adams,
It's midnight! Our meeting...

251
00:30:29,495 --> 00:30:30,621
Professor?

252
00:30:46,637 --> 00:30:47,888
Who did this?

253
00:30:48,889 --> 00:30:50,850
The women knows why.

254
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:53,602
Go find her!

255
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,521
Your car.

256
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,023
Wait.

257
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,609
See this!

258
00:31:01,861 --> 00:31:03,237
I took it away from the Museum...

259
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,489
to keep it safe...

260
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:07,658
It is...

261
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:10,160
the fragment you are looking for.

262
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,163
The Egyptian queen came here

263
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:16,000
to found the new the city of the Sun,

264
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,252
for her father Akhenaton.

265
00:31:18,919 --> 00:31:21,922
This's the new sacred land
of the Egyptians...

266
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,427
- Put me down.
- Yes.

267
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,682
Be careful!

268
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,559
Be careful!

269
00:31:33,642 --> 00:31:35,269
Shemsu Hot...

270
00:31:37,813 --> 00:31:38,939
Who are you?

271
00:31:43,068 --> 00:31:44,278
SALIGIA.

272
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:36,956
I hope you well.

273
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:40,501
It's the first murder
I have seen in this area.

274
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,878
The killer has no identity.

275
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:44,254
Unrecognizable.

276
00:32:45,255 --> 00:32:46,382
No badge,

277
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:49,843
and the fingerprints have
been removed with acid.

278
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:51,887
It's terrible!

279
00:32:56,225 --> 00:32:58,894
We'll need a couple of hours
for the retina recognition.

280
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,271
And the people at Moratorium...

281
00:33:01,397 --> 00:33:04,358
I hope they will get something
out of that brain. It's a mess.

282
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:07,987
What are you doing in this area?

283
00:33:08,028 --> 00:33:09,530
I am a University assistant,

284
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:11,865
specialized in Egyptology.

285
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,034
Well, then you were a colleague
of the director?

286
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:17,162
You could say so, just met him
today for the first time.

287
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:20,624
Please, do not leave the area
for the time being.

288
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,876
I will probably need to talk to you
again.

289
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:25,170
I have a room at the Sun Hotel.

290
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,506
You can find me there.

291
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,947
Destination set.

292
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,350
Can I come in...please...can I?

293
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,936
It's you... again?

294
00:34:23,437 --> 00:34:26,482
What do you want from me'?
I don't want to see you anymore!

295
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:29,485
I'm sorry... I just wanted to...

296
00:34:30,444 --> 00:34:32,571
Oh... I'm sorry, I thought you were...

297
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:34,865
No, don't worry, it's my fault...

298
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:38,452
I'm not used to get inside
people's houses like this, trust me.

299
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:40,871
I got your address from professor
Al Kamar.

300
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:42,623
Are you Miss Sarah Eve?

301
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:44,208
Yes, it's me...

302
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:48,128
ls the professor all right?
I haven't seen him for a long time.

303
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:52,883
I'm sorry the Professor
was killed last night.

304
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,390
How did it happen?

305
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:02,267
I was there... I tried to help him...

306
00:35:02,392 --> 00:35:03,519
too late. ..

307
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,896
I'm sorry. Do you want me
to pass by later?

308
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,356
Yes, thank you ...

309
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:10,275
Maybe it's better if I stay alone.

310
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,279
Wait!

311
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,241
There's something else
you wanted to tell me, right?

312
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,617
Well...ah...

313
00:35:19,743 --> 00:35:22,788
The professor left me a last message...
Or so I believe...

314
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:25,999
He told me to contact you
in case something happened to him.

315
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,376
I'm Arthur...

316
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,420
Arthur Adams,
I am an archaeological researcher...

317
00:35:30,504 --> 00:35:33,173
I came hereto get some informations
on an ancient scroll.

318
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,635
The Professor was the only one
who could help me...

319
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,179
I think the murder is connected to
this ancient document.

320
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,431
Did you know anything about his
researches?

321
00:35:41,515 --> 00:35:42,641
No...

322
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,561
I just gave him some artistic
counseling...

323
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:47,563
I am a painter.

324
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:50,149
I've been working on the restoration
of some sarcophagi.

325
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,442
But...

326
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:54,570
Why was he killed?

327
00:35:57,573 --> 00:36:00,033
This was lying on the Professor's face.

328
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,914
I think it's a copy...
but it looks very ancient, indeed.

329
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,219
If it's a copy...

330
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:21,430
a master might have done it.

331
00:36:23,557 --> 00:36:25,934
I'll give you the contact of
a top forensic consultant.

332
00:36:26,351 --> 00:36:27,728
He's a good friend of mine.

333
00:36:27,853 --> 00:36:29,563
Tell him I'm sending you.

334
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,609
I don't know anybody in this town.
Could you please come with me?

335
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:36,236
I would be glad... plus is your friend.

336
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:39,740
I am too busy working...
I really can't... I'm sorry.

337
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,621
My office could pay you well...

338
00:36:48,999 --> 00:36:50,959
I'm so happy to see you...

339
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,878
But you never call...

340
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,258
This is Professor Arthur Adams.

341
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,760
Arthur is fine.

342
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,638
A mistake of my youth.

343
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,518
Here's a small present for you...

344
00:37:09,228 --> 00:37:10,604
A real mystery.

345
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,359
What do you think it is?

346
00:37:15,776 --> 00:37:16,902
Just a moment.

347
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:23,533
Do you think is gonna find connections?

348
00:37:25,035 --> 00:37:27,621
Connections seem invisible,

349
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:30,624
but they are just hidden behind the
surface.

350
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,293
You simply scratch...

351
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:36,004
and they burst out, like fireworks.

352
00:37:37,172 --> 00:37:39,925
Only those who have eyes to see...

353
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:43,637
can spot them... of course.

354
00:37:44,304 --> 00:37:45,430
You know...

355
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:48,433
he's a strange guy...

356
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,561
a man of science...

357
00:37:53,689 --> 00:37:55,524
He knows a lot about religion,

358
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,818
Kabala, even metaphysics.

359
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,406
He's a pure researcher...
with no prejudices.

360
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:05,659
- He puts no limit to knowledge...
- No...

361
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,412
It's not just a replica,

362
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:11,415
not a recent one, at least...

363
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:15,335
It must be dating back to the XVI
century.

364
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,171
The brushstrokes...

365
00:38:18,964 --> 00:38:20,340
they seem...

366
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:23,176
Hieronymus Bosch's!

367
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:27,973
Let's call a friend of mine...
An enlightened mind, a real expert.

368
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:31,059
Just a moment.

369
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,854
What did I tell you?

370
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,231
He's just a bit weird.

371
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,613
It's me, how are you doing?

372
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,991
I need to talk to you.

373
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:54,624
...l would like to end my speech
with this book,

374
00:38:56,126 --> 00:39:01,506
In it... you'll find the analysis of
the relationships between two groups.

375
00:39:01,965 --> 00:39:04,468
One had been: the Faithful of Love,

376
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:07,512
which Dante was undoubtedly a member.

377
00:39:08,347 --> 00:39:12,100
The other had been:
the Brotherhood of the Free Spirit,

378
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:15,771
which no doubt Bosch was an attendant.

379
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:20,400
Both groups were aware
of the Egyptian philosophy

380
00:39:21,109 --> 00:39:24,112
and the ideas of the Followers of Horus.

381
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,242
Curiously, both men were interested

382
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,787
in the seven deadly sins...

383
00:39:32,913 --> 00:39:35,874
It been said that both men

384
00:39:35,916 --> 00:39:39,920
were particularly sparing.

385
00:39:42,506 --> 00:39:43,799
I'm myself...

386
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,761
guilty of that vice.

387
00:39:50,389 --> 00:39:55,018
This text is...
extremely expensive.

388
00:39:57,396 --> 00:40:02,150
In conclusion,
I like to read you something...

389
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:05,570
I think you may understand.

390
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:08,532
This tercet from the Paradise,

391
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:13,328
where Dante talks about the mystical
Rose.

392
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:20,544
"The Love, beneath whose warmth
this flower has grown in eternal

393
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:23,547
peace, flamed once again in your womb”.

394
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:36,309
Listen Tully...
we've found a piece of canvas,

395
00:40:36,351 --> 00:40:39,312
it looks like Bosch's, it's Pride...

396
00:40:39,354 --> 00:40:42,315
I've heard that story as a rumor,
a legend.

397
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,486
Bosch created a series of drawings,

398
00:40:46,611 --> 00:40:48,738
before settling them into one.

399
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:50,490
A guy came to see me,

400
00:40:51,825 --> 00:40:54,703
and he was asking me a lot of
questions...

401
00:40:55,245 --> 00:40:56,955
about the drawings.

402
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:03,503
He was mentioning some kind of plot...

403
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:05,630
You see!

404
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,467
So, I think he was nuts... mad.

405
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,218
A crazy man.

406
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:15,515
So, I send him off
I told him to go away.

407
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:19,519
But I remember his name:

408
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,231
Frank Mare.

409
00:41:24,524 --> 00:41:27,360
As a poet Virgil surname.

410
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,988
Thank you very much, Taron.
Ok, see you later.

411
00:41:35,494 --> 00:41:37,746
He found this guy, Frank Maro.

412
00:41:38,038 --> 00:41:41,917
He's been busted a few times
for violence and intimidation.

413
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:47,047
He's now living in an underground
area of the town...slums.

414
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,925
A shelter for thieves and invisible
people.

415
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,635
So, let's go.

416
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:00,018
Look!

417
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,187
People call it the Gate of Hell...

418
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,272
a mysterious place.

419
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,562
Attention, don't come in.
It's dangerous for you!

420
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,578
We're looking for a man called
Frank Maro.

421
00:43:00,245 --> 00:43:03,123
- Can you help us'?
- What do you want? Go away!

422
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,377
Come on!

423
00:43:25,395 --> 00:43:26,396
No.

424
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:31,276
He will be good to you
if you don't challenge him...

425
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:34,029
He's Gengis...

426
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,407
I know where to find
the man you are looking for...

427
00:43:37,741 --> 00:43:38,783
I can help you.

428
00:43:38,908 --> 00:43:41,161
But, he's the one who set the price.

429
00:44:04,643 --> 00:44:06,645
I know where you can find him...

430
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,439
I can bring you to him...

431
00:44:09,522 --> 00:44:12,317
It will be expensive though...

432
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:13,902
How much?

433
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:17,947
Let's say a 50 post-credits pass
gallery.

434
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:21,201
A 30 post-credits pass is enough!

435
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:29,459
Ok, let's go.

436
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,420
The pass, first!

437
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:16,965
Arthur.

438
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,509
- Arthur, let's go.
- Sure.

439
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,710
Follow your heart...

440
00:46:36,669 --> 00:46:40,089
The light of your most brilliant star...

441
00:46:40,173 --> 00:46:42,550
will lead you to the roots...

442
00:46:42,592 --> 00:46:45,303
to the Truth...

443
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,359
Here we are, it's him.

444
00:47:02,862 --> 00:47:04,447
Who the hell are you?

445
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,243
You've come here to kill me, right'?

446
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,120
I know nothing,

447
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:13,081
I've seen nothing.

448
00:47:14,374 --> 00:47:16,584
Get away... leave me alone!

449
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,628
Don't worry, we don't mean to hurt you.

450
00:47:18,711 --> 00:47:21,005
Don't be scared, we only want
informations.

451
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:26,845
What?

452
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,388
James, are you ok?

453
00:47:28,513 --> 00:47:30,014
Get him out of here.

454
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,641
Take him away!

455
00:47:31,975 --> 00:47:33,142
I'll be after you.

456
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:34,394
Let's go away!

457
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,272
They're looking for me.

458
00:47:37,355 --> 00:47:39,107
I'm coming...

459
00:47:39,649 --> 00:47:40,900
I'm coming with you...

460
00:47:41,484 --> 00:47:42,652
Wait for me, please.

461
00:47:43,361 --> 00:47:45,113
I'm coming with you!

462
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,695
You must help us...

463
00:48:25,778 --> 00:48:29,032
You must tell us everything you
know about Bosch's paintings. Ok?

464
00:48:29,073 --> 00:48:31,576
We will protect you, don't be scared.

465
00:48:33,202 --> 00:48:34,704
You don't know{

466
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,581
who these guys are.

467
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:42,587
You can't imagine.
They can reach everywhere...

468
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,964
Nothing can stop them.

469
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:46,549
Nobody can!

470
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,426
They... they... Who are "they"?

471
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:50,303
Frank, please, listen to me.

472
00:48:51,596 --> 00:48:53,848
You must help us, now!

473
00:48:54,349 --> 00:48:55,475
Please...

474
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,310
It's too dangerous...

475
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:59,938
For me, for you Miss...

476
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:03,107
and for everybody.

477
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:05,568
Believe me!

478
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:10,239
It's for your own good.

479
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:12,951
For everybody's good.

480
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,620
Who knows about this story?

481
00:49:16,871 --> 00:49:18,122
There's a writer...

482
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:23,086
He's living in a small village
in the mountains...

483
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,631
He's a Count...

484
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,092
Rosebud...

485
00:49:30,385 --> 00:49:34,263
He's been living
and working there all his life.

486
00:49:34,889 --> 00:49:36,265
The name, damn it!

487
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:39,143
His name is Francis Rosebud.

488
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,146
I know nothing else about him.

489
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:48,152
He's the heir of the Count
who built the village.

490
00:49:50,989 --> 00:49:53,241
I hope you're not trying to trick us!

491
00:49:53,783 --> 00:49:55,243
I'm not cheating.

492
00:49:55,284 --> 00:49:58,037
I'm not cheating.

493
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:01,666
I know very little about all this.

494
00:50:04,669 --> 00:50:07,505
The other ones know...

495
00:50:09,048 --> 00:50:10,925
I have nothing to do with it.

496
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,927
Nothing! Nothing!

497
00:50:13,761 --> 00:50:16,055
Why did they want to hide the truth?

498
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:18,057
I don't know.

499
00:50:18,808 --> 00:50:20,393
I don't know!

500
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:23,938
They're very dangerous people.

501
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:27,650
But Rosebud...

502
00:50:28,443 --> 00:50:29,694
I know...

503
00:50:30,445 --> 00:50:32,321
He wanted to talk.

504
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:36,701
Yes, he has written things that...

505
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:40,329
That's enough for me.

506
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:44,292
I don't know anything else.

507
00:50:45,209 --> 00:50:46,711
Leave me alone...

508
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,674
Leave me alone!

509
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:01,851
That's all we can get from this man...

510
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,937
using this white-glove treatment, at
least

511
00:51:06,105 --> 00:51:08,441
Look... Look what they say about the
Count.

512
00:51:09,984 --> 00:51:12,111
He's a scientist, a mathematician...

513
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,948
He's discovered some links
between the works of Nicolas Tesla

514
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:20,578
and a mysterious structure
hidden inside the Pyramid of Cheops,

515
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:21,996
the Zed!

516
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,458
He's been expelled by the University
on a charge of molesting.

517
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:30,129
Here, at an essay's presentation,
he's with a model...

518
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:33,841
They look very intimate.
Can we trace her down?

519
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,718
No...no she's not a model...

520
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,138
She's an agent of a
para-governmental organization

521
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,389
of the big "Z".

522
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:43,226
It's an escort service for the
oligarchs.

523
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:44,727
They're called "Priss"

524
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,229
"High pleasure models".

525
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,648
I've questioned her for
an ongoing investigation,

526
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,650
but she's not involved.

527
00:51:50,775 --> 00:51:52,360
Well, I can contact the girl...

528
00:51:52,985 --> 00:51:55,363
Then I can arrange a meeting
if you want...

529
00:51:55,530 --> 00:51:57,365
We're making a Tv show

530
00:51:57,406 --> 00:51:59,867
about magic towns
and we need a presenter.

531
00:52:00,118 --> 00:52:02,537
We've saw you in an article
about the Count of Rosebud.

532
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:05,373
Our show is starting precisely over
there.

533
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:07,291
A strange coincidence, isn't it?

534
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,169
Yes, I love coincidences...

535
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:13,172
They attract me and scare me
all the same.

536
00:52:13,548 --> 00:52:14,799
Do you personally know the Count?

537
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,509
We'd like to talk
to him and meet him...

538
00:52:16,551 --> 00:52:18,678
to gather informations
for our Tv show.

539
00:52:18,803 --> 00:52:23,141
The Count is an excellent customer,
very gentle and kind.

540
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,309
Yesterday, I was with him.

541
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:30,565
Sometimes he invites me to his place.
A really ghostly place.

542
00:52:31,399 --> 00:52:33,818
If you go there...
you could have your arm healed.

543
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,946
There is a mysterious woman, Althea,

544
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:40,074
living next to the village church.

545
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:44,036
She's a real healer and you
can ask her for information, too...

546
00:52:44,078 --> 00:52:46,706
She's spent her entire life
in the village.

547
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:49,959
Where she was born.

548
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:06,934
I was waiting for you...

549
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:18,821
I've a constant pain in my arm.

550
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:20,489
It's there, since I was badly wounded...

551
00:53:20,615 --> 00:53:22,074
Let me see...

552
00:53:25,494 --> 00:53:26,621
Yes...

553
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:31,959
Yes, I can do something...
Wait for me here.

554
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,399
How do you heal the sick people
who come to see you?

555
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:59,278
All my ancestors had a gift
and were healers...

556
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,155
My mother before me,

557
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:03,115
her mother before her...

558
00:54:03,783 --> 00:54:05,117
and so on,

559
00:54:05,618 --> 00:54:09,538
from immemorial time...
the touch of the “Masca”

560
00:54:09,664 --> 00:54:12,917
is a gift, not a job...

561
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,419
It's a mission.

562
00:54:16,879 --> 00:54:19,674
My ancestors got
their "Art" directly from Thoth,

563
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:22,009
the ancient god of Medicine.

564
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,397
Can I ask you something?

565
00:54:34,438 --> 00:54:37,316
Of course, my dear, tell me.

566
00:54:38,693 --> 00:54:42,071
We've come here to find a man:
the Count Rosebud.

567
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,534
I guessed it, of course.

568
00:54:46,951 --> 00:54:48,286
Can you help us?

569
00:54:49,161 --> 00:54:50,705
Francis was born here.

570
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:54,458
He bears the same name of his ancestor,

571
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:58,963
the nobleman who built the village.
But he's very different.

572
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:02,091
He has wasted all his money
in some unclear business.

573
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,051
He lives with his sister,

574
00:55:05,553 --> 00:55:06,721
a strange woman...

575
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:10,808
She never comes to the village,
she spends all her time in the cemetery.

576
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,853
Her son died
immediately after birth,

577
00:55:13,936 --> 00:55:17,356
no chance to put him
in the Moratorium, too young.

578
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:21,610
A fatherless son.

579
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:25,489
Francis never comes to the village
either.

580
00:55:28,492 --> 00:55:31,245
They live in the castle above the
village.

581
00:56:07,656 --> 00:56:08,908
It's her, I guess.

582
00:56:09,867 --> 00:56:11,410
Let's go and talk to her.

583
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,374
Sorry to bother you, Madam.

584
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:18,918
We're looking for the Countess Rosebud.

585
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,669
Can you help us?

586
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,547
Young Countess...
The young Countess...

587
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,424
Yes.

588
00:56:30,679 --> 00:56:33,182
Yes, it's me. What do you want?

589
00:56:34,058 --> 00:56:37,019
We're looking for your brother,
the Count Francis.

590
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,688
And what do you want from him?

591
00:56:40,398 --> 00:56:43,067
Miss Nora Segni told us
we could find him here.

592
00:56:43,526 --> 00:56:47,530
We wanted to talk to him
about the origins of Rosebud.

593
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:51,534
He's in town for some business.
He will be back tonight.

594
00:56:52,034 --> 00:56:53,702
You can find him at the village inn.

595
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:56,956
He spends his dinner time there,
with his friends.

596
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,918
I have to go now.

597
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,347
I will tell him about your visit.

598
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,475
Don't worry!

599
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:32,324
I'm glad you come with me.

600
00:57:35,244 --> 00:57:37,204
My arm... ls not aching anymore...

601
00:57:38,497 --> 00:57:40,624
Did you know, everywhere we look,

602
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:42,710
there his some traces of Egypt.

603
00:57:44,128 --> 00:57:45,963
Maybe, we are on the right track...

604
00:57:46,005 --> 00:57:47,381
or maybe...

605
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:51,385
It's just your imagination.

606
00:57:52,011 --> 00:57:53,387
Yeah.

607
00:57:56,891 --> 00:58:02,021
The Countess has just called...
The Count is inviting you to his castle.

608
00:58:05,274 --> 00:58:06,901
They live in the castle.

609
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:10,112
Follow those alleys,

610
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:13,866
pass under...our magic door...

611
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:17,036
reach the fountain of live...

612
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:20,623
go staight... and there you are.

613
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,180
Please, come in.

614
00:58:36,889 --> 00:58:39,308
Thank you.

615
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:51,278
My brother is waiting for you.

616
00:59:02,164 --> 00:59:06,835
Welcome...thank you for accepting
my suddenly invitation.

617
00:59:07,461 --> 00:59:09,338
I hope I can help you.

618
00:59:17,471 --> 00:59:18,556
Please.

619
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:25,187
My dear "friend", Nora...

620
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,234
told me you are interested in making
a TV show about Rosebud.

621
00:59:30,359 --> 00:59:33,571
Yes, we are preparing a series about
the magic towns of Piedmont.

622
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:37,241
I've been studying the same
subject for many years.

623
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:41,370
It looks like the whole area of Piedmont

624
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,624
has the shape of a huge town...

625
00:59:45,749 --> 00:59:48,460
with precise mathematical proportions.

626
00:59:48,627 --> 00:59:50,713
An open-sky sanctuary.

627
00:59:52,006 --> 00:59:54,008
A heritage from the Egyptian models.

628
00:59:55,509 --> 00:59:57,094
Far more than this,

629
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:59,888
every architectural model...

630
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:04,768
is in perfect harmony with
the human proportions.

631
01:00:06,520 --> 01:00:10,983
I've been searching for perfection
through the body my whole life.

632
01:00:11,775 --> 01:00:16,030
I'm especially interested in
the female shape...

633
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:21,410
As my master Tesla,
I consider the female body

634
01:00:21,535 --> 01:00:25,914
as the symbol of the primordial energy.

635
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:29,752
The human body as an energy
transmitter...

636
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:35,633
Wait a minute. I want to show you
something.

637
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:52,274
Don't worry about
the Shuster Law, my friends...

638
01:00:55,694 --> 01:01:01,950
Now, have a close look: the Tesla's
Tower has the same structure of the Zed.

639
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:07,831
Here the Zed is inserted in the Ankh
key...

640
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:12,086
Tesla was prevented from ending his
work...

641
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:13,712
so bad.

642
01:01:17,216 --> 01:01:20,469
Let's go back to Rosebud, now...

643
01:01:20,594 --> 01:01:22,846
That's the reason of your visit, right?

644
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:24,223
Yes.

645
01:01:24,807 --> 01:01:28,602
This area has been breeding
many Master Masons,

646
01:01:28,686 --> 01:01:33,315
skillful about alchemical
and hermetic symbols.

647
01:01:34,066 --> 01:01:37,069
Nicolao, the famous stone-cutter,

648
01:01:37,111 --> 01:01:41,198
was working in the nearby
Abbey of St. Michael.

649
01:01:42,366 --> 01:01:44,243
The Abbey of St. Michael...

650
01:01:46,995 --> 01:01:48,622
The Abbey of St. Michael...

651
01:01:49,832 --> 01:01:51,959
is one of the Gates of Heaven.

652
01:01:52,876 --> 01:01:55,003
As Rosebud: a sacred place.

653
01:01:55,629 --> 01:01:58,382
My ancestor was a very influent man...

654
01:01:58,882 --> 01:02:03,137
in this hall, many important figures
of the XIX century

655
01:02:03,637 --> 01:02:06,223
have gathered from all over Europe.

656
01:02:07,224 --> 01:02:10,602
Look at the Starry Sky...

657
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:16,483
It's the last relic of those bright
times.

658
01:03:40,734 --> 01:03:43,195
Sorry to bother you, Count.
It's for you.

659
01:03:43,612 --> 01:03:44,696
Thank you.

660
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:47,324
Excuse me.

661
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:54,706
Hello?

662
01:03:55,958 --> 01:03:57,000
Thank you.

663
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,841
Sorry, a friend's in trouble.

664
01:04:04,633 --> 01:04:08,011
But we can talk again tomorrow, right?

665
01:04:38,417 --> 01:04:40,919
EN, who are you'?

666
01:05:53,075 --> 01:05:55,869
This is the Police, are you Arthur
Adams?

667
01:05:55,994 --> 01:05:57,120
Yeah.

668
01:05:57,204 --> 01:05:59,623
Sorry, but Mr. Moonlight has been
killed.

669
01:05:59,706 --> 01:06:00,749
What?

670
01:06:00,999 --> 01:06:02,501
How did happen?

671
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:06,380
We can't give you information,
you've to come here immediately.

672
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:12,511
Of course, no informations.

673
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:16,974
We don't have a clue,
we've only an ancient painting.

674
01:06:18,517 --> 01:06:20,394
What, a painting?

675
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,270
Yeah, I've to come here tomorrow.

676
01:06:22,854 --> 01:06:25,774
No, I'm coming right now, immediately.

677
01:06:27,734 --> 01:06:29,653
There is no reason for this murder.

678
01:06:30,028 --> 01:06:33,115
You know Agent, when I was in Italy
for my researches.

679
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:36,410
A similar murder happened
there, same patterns...

680
01:06:39,788 --> 01:06:41,164
I think they're connected.

681
01:06:41,248 --> 01:06:44,501
You can ask for information from
the agent Taron Irons in Turin...

682
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:47,129
Just a second.

683
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:02,686
York's agent here, Detective McGuire.
Are you the agent Iron?

684
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:03,937
Yes, it's me.

685
01:07:04,021 --> 01:07:05,564
Do you know Mr. Adams?

686
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:08,525
Yes, I know him,
he's a very good guy.

687
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:11,153
I guarantee for him.

688
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:13,947
He's not involved in this murder.

689
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,036
You were right.

690
01:07:19,077 --> 01:07:21,329
The Italian agent witnessed for you...

691
01:07:21,455 --> 01:07:24,207
But, please, remain at our disposal.

692
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:30,088
Professor Ludwig Adrian Moonlight

693
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:32,340
has made you his universal heir.

694
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:35,469
He left a small part of
his fortune to the Foundation.

695
01:07:37,471 --> 01:07:39,723
He must have loved you very much.

696
01:07:41,308 --> 01:07:43,101
He was like a father to me...

697
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:45,729
My mentor.

698
01:07:45,979 --> 01:07:48,231
This was included in Moonlight's...

699
01:07:48,356 --> 01:07:50,317
last will.

700
01:07:54,571 --> 01:07:56,114
I leave you here.

701
01:08:11,505 --> 01:08:12,631
Arthur. ..

702
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:15,258
You were like a son to me.

703
01:08:17,010 --> 01:08:20,597
So I decided to make you
my heir in every sense.

704
01:08:22,724 --> 01:08:25,727
I trust you will find the way
to follow your destiny...

705
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,980
and continue our search without me.

706
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:31,149
Remember:

707
01:08:31,650 --> 01:08:34,903
the true nature of things is always
hidden.

708
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:37,405
This is your journey.

709
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:39,533
Be strong!

710
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:41,535
Be yourself...

711
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,121
and be goddamn genius!

712
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,374
Good Luck, my boy.

713
01:09:00,428 --> 01:09:02,806
...and then the notary gave me
a postal package,

714
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:05,392
a confidential box... and a letter.

715
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,312
Inside, there was the missing scroll.

716
01:09:09,437 --> 01:09:10,564
And the letter?

717
01:09:10,689 --> 01:09:12,440
It was totally in the Professor's style.

718
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:15,569
He wrote me about a task I've to
accomplish.

719
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:18,029
We've to go back to the Egyptian Museum.

720
01:09:18,071 --> 01:09:19,823
Everything started over there.

721
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:22,951
There must be something I'm missing.

722
01:09:25,412 --> 01:09:28,165
- We've to dig inside the paper
archives. - No, it's crazy.

723
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:30,584
It's a major violation
of the Shuster's law.

724
01:09:31,084 --> 01:09:32,586
We'll end up in jail!

725
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:34,838
No one can enter in the archives, ok?

726
01:09:35,964 --> 01:09:37,340
It's too dangerous.

727
01:09:37,841 --> 01:09:39,301
Nothing is impossible.

728
01:09:39,593 --> 01:09:42,470
A dear friend of mine
is working in the archives.

729
01:09:44,556 --> 01:09:46,600
What are you doing?
Go back to your bed!

730
01:09:46,975 --> 01:09:48,727
No time to rest. I'm fine.

731
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:57,736
Esther, it's nice to see you.

732
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:01,823
- It's a long time. Can we go?
- Yeah.

733
01:10:02,616 --> 01:10:03,617
It's done.

734
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:07,078
Esther will let us get inside the
archives.

735
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:10,123
But you have to be very careful.

736
01:10:10,624 --> 01:10:12,250
Just the two of them...

737
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:14,461
You stay here with me.

738
01:10:16,004 --> 01:10:18,506
There are so many things
you have to tell me.

739
01:10:19,758 --> 01:10:21,134
Ok, then.

740
01:10:22,010 --> 01:10:23,261
Pay attention,

741
01:10:23,345 --> 01:10:25,972
and look at every detail
that can help us.

742
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:31,728
Thank you.

743
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:34,022
So...

744
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:15,021
- I go this way, you can go the other.
- Ok.

745
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:38,169
Sarah, are you ok?

746
01:11:42,549 --> 01:11:44,217
Sarah, where are you?

747
01:11:44,592 --> 01:11:45,927
Are you all right?

748
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:53,411
Are you ok?

749
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,122
Why didn't you answer me?

750
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:59,292
I heard you...
but I didn't want to scream.

751
01:13:00,251 --> 01:13:02,670
I was far from you,
trying to find the light switch.

752
01:13:03,922 --> 01:13:05,632
It switched off automatically.

753
01:13:07,509 --> 01:13:08,927
Are you ok?

754
01:13:09,302 --> 01:13:12,180
I feel better now. What did you find?

755
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:14,265
I just had a look.

756
01:13:14,557 --> 01:13:17,811
Inside this folder there's a
document mentioning our scroll...

757
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,646
and the followers of Horus

758
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:22,190
connected with the seven deadly sins.

759
01:13:23,024 --> 01:13:24,442
They mention the god Thot

760
01:13:24,526 --> 01:13:27,946
and strange links with
Dante, Egypt and Bosch.

761
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:31,825
The author of the document is a woman:
Sandra Tule.

762
01:13:33,451 --> 01:13:36,955
Here, she talks about something
kept in the Abbey of St. Michael.

763
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,958
We've to show this document
immediately to James,

764
01:13:40,083 --> 01:13:42,460
- maybe he can find
other connections. - Ok.

765
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:58,726
We've found something.

766
01:14:04,315 --> 01:14:07,110
St. Michael... St. Michael Abbey.

767
01:14:34,387 --> 01:14:36,764
My friends... Welcome to Paradise.

768
01:14:37,640 --> 01:14:38,850
I'm father Hugo.

769
01:14:39,601 --> 01:14:42,103
- I assume, you're hereto see the
Abbey? - Yes.

770
01:14:43,354 --> 01:14:44,397
As you can see,

771
01:14:44,481 --> 01:14:47,650
Paradise is difficult to reach!

772
01:14:49,861 --> 01:14:53,406
Your friend seems like is not in
condition for such a difficult walk.

773
01:14:55,366 --> 01:14:56,993
Perhaps I can get in the car with you,

774
01:14:57,035 --> 01:14:59,662
we go to the main gate
and then we can walk from there.

775
01:14:59,787 --> 01:15:01,039
Thank you.

776
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:02,749
Lovely.

777
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:10,673
...sooner or later this road
is going to kill me.

778
01:15:12,926 --> 01:15:16,679
If not that, the beer
and the sandwiches will...

779
01:15:20,266 --> 01:15:21,309
Anyway,

780
01:15:21,768 --> 01:15:24,062
it's better to go with a full stomach,
yes?

781
01:15:24,437 --> 01:15:28,274
And surely, the air of this sacred place

782
01:15:28,316 --> 01:15:30,443
will have me go as a happy man!

783
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,530
Thank you for you company.

784
01:15:34,822 --> 01:15:37,200
- Enjoy the Abbey.
- Thank you.

785
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:39,077
I'm going to the dining hall,

786
01:15:39,202 --> 01:15:43,456
after such a rigorous walk,
one should've something of substance.

787
01:15:44,916 --> 01:15:45,959
Enjoy.

788
01:16:23,496 --> 01:16:25,957
It was carved by Nicolao.

789
01:16:45,143 --> 01:16:47,145
My friends are still here.

790
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:49,647
Excellent!

791
01:16:53,484 --> 01:16:56,029
How about I take you for
a behind-the-scenes tour?

792
01:17:01,534 --> 01:17:03,119
And how about you?

793
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,413
Are you coming?

794
01:17:06,914 --> 01:17:08,416
Yes, I'm coming...

795
01:17:09,167 --> 01:17:10,752
Maybe that man wants to come, too...

796
01:17:10,793 --> 01:17:12,170
What man?

797
01:17:14,631 --> 01:17:16,257
No, he's not there anymore.

798
01:17:25,642 --> 01:17:26,809
...as I was saying before,

799
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:29,187
the Abbey is dedicated
to the Archangel Michael...

800
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,439
Here, he's crushing the tempting devil.
As you know...

801
01:17:31,522 --> 01:17:34,400
The temptations of Satan
can be intense...

802
01:17:34,442 --> 01:17:36,694
and only the Saints can resist them.

803
01:17:36,778 --> 01:17:38,905
One temptation I can't resist is:
Gluttony.

804
01:17:38,946 --> 01:17:41,449
Why everybody always blames the
gluttons?

805
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:45,328
Dante puts them in Hell.
Bosch paints them eating like pigs.

806
01:17:45,411 --> 01:17:47,538
Everybody has to eat, right?

807
01:17:49,791 --> 01:17:51,959
Ah, I have a real treasure for you.

808
01:17:53,294 --> 01:17:55,213
It's my favourite... come!

809
01:20:13,351 --> 01:20:16,854
The chapel down below
was built in the 5th Century.

810
01:20:17,939 --> 01:20:19,106
Incredible, ah!?

811
01:20:22,193 --> 01:20:25,488
Come up here, I get something
very special for you. Please.

812
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,247
The Susa Valley.

813
01:21:14,537 --> 01:21:15,788
Arthur!

814
01:21:16,747 --> 01:21:19,667
Don't worry, he must be inside the
Abbey,

815
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,502
we'll find him later.

816
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:26,132
He can't get lost...
there's only one way down.

817
01:21:29,302 --> 01:21:33,806
The Susa Valley which provided a passage
for the Longobards in the 6th Century.

818
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,936
You're looking straight across
the mountain to France.

819
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:41,647
Paradise.

820
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:50,698
Don't scream!
A sudden awakening could make him fall.

821
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:52,450
Oh my... Stay here.

822
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:45,503
Arthur.

823
01:22:47,380 --> 01:22:49,715
Wake up...

824
01:22:51,759 --> 01:22:53,010
St. Michael...

825
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,263
Head of the heavenly army...

826
01:22:57,765 --> 01:23:00,142
Please, help this man...

827
01:23:00,893 --> 01:23:03,521
Save this man... Spare this man...

828
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,024
Archangel of the Heavens.

829
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:12,780
You have the power.
Please, give him the power.

830
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,408
Give him the strength!

831
01:23:15,908 --> 01:23:17,034
Heal him!

832
01:23:17,868 --> 01:23:19,286
Please, St. Michael.

833
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:19,221
What happened?!

834
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:23,100
I was flying in the void...
An angel with a bird's face

835
01:24:23,184 --> 01:24:26,187
slow down my fall.
Was it a dream?!

836
01:24:26,604 --> 01:24:28,606
No. You really fell.

837
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:30,608
Impossible, it was real?

838
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:31,984
I go to call an ambulance.

839
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:34,320
I was a child, I was fine. My father...

840
01:24:35,821 --> 01:24:38,115
Did you see him?
The angel used his sword...

841
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,493
Don't worry, be quiet.

842
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:44,371
He used his sword to hit the dragon.

843
01:24:45,122 --> 01:24:46,499
The dragon disappeared.

844
01:24:47,124 --> 01:24:49,085
On the top of the sword it was a key...

845
01:24:49,627 --> 01:24:50,753
A broken key!

846
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,755
What a strange dream...

847
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,341
Maybe ...

848
01:25:30,167 --> 01:25:31,669
' got it!

849
01:25:36,924 --> 01:25:38,551
It was all true.

850
01:25:39,301 --> 01:25:40,302
But...

851
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:42,680
Where is that man gone?

852
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:22,970
Is he your friend? Can we trust him?

853
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:26,056
Those who look for the truth
are more than friends.

854
01:26:26,557 --> 01:26:28,058
They're brothers.

855
01:26:30,477 --> 01:26:31,604
Hello.

856
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:37,610
Good to see you.

857
01:26:38,611 --> 01:26:39,862
You are welcome.

858
01:26:40,487 --> 01:26:42,239
Let's go to the next room.

859
01:26:42,948 --> 01:26:45,367
It's quieter...
and no one will bother us.

860
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,953
The broken key...

861
01:26:50,206 --> 01:26:55,002
both an ancient symbol
of wisdom and our circle,

862
01:26:55,711 --> 01:26:58,130
but the Ankh...

863
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:01,884
There are some connections
to the Egyptian Tradition

864
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:04,637
of Horus and Thot...

865
01:27:04,845 --> 01:27:06,764
There're many, many interpretations.

866
01:27:06,847 --> 01:27:08,474
Interpretations... such as?

867
01:27:10,226 --> 01:27:12,394
Certain things cannot be shared.

868
01:27:12,895 --> 01:27:13,979
Always secrets.

869
01:27:14,021 --> 01:27:18,359
But of course, dear boy...
Life is full of secrets.

870
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:21,904
And we cannot digest them all at once.

871
01:27:22,488 --> 01:27:24,990
It takes time and patience.

872
01:27:26,492 --> 01:27:29,620
We must reach deep and
find our own understanding.

873
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:33,749
The broken key represents
the impossibility

874
01:27:33,791 --> 01:27:37,544
to discovered a secret even if
it's in front of our eyes,

875
01:27:37,670 --> 01:27:39,171
under our nose!

876
01:27:40,547 --> 01:27:43,425
The broken key comes to us
in many ways...

877
01:27:43,509 --> 01:27:45,386
Yes but, what's its meaning?

878
01:27:46,303 --> 01:27:47,805
Explaining a symbol,

879
01:27:47,888 --> 01:27:50,933
is like telling someone
how to feel in front of the first love

880
01:27:51,016 --> 01:27:53,894
or in front of a work of Art...

881
01:27:54,645 --> 01:27:58,315
There're as many feelings...
as people in the world.

882
01:27:58,941 --> 01:28:00,025
Clear?

883
01:28:02,069 --> 01:28:03,153
No...

884
01:28:03,696 --> 01:28:06,532
Well, so much for explanations.

885
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:09,702
But if yiu truly want to
discover the secret

886
01:28:10,202 --> 01:28:12,663
you have to dive into the symbol itself

887
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:17,459
by entering into your soul.
The path of the perfect man...

888
01:28:18,085 --> 01:28:21,463
like the Androgyne in Bosch's painting.

889
01:28:22,423 --> 01:28:24,341
James, give me some water, please...

890
01:28:24,466 --> 01:28:25,592
Yeah, sure.

891
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:37,855
You must embody the broken key...

892
01:28:37,980 --> 01:28:40,441
become one with it...

893
01:28:40,482 --> 01:28:42,609
in order to find...

894
01:28:42,693 --> 01:28:46,113
where the Truth is concealed.

895
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,492
Symbols, secrets, metaphors...

896
01:28:51,952 --> 01:28:53,954
They are all paths

897
01:28:53,996 --> 01:28:56,707
to help us realize

898
01:28:57,249 --> 01:29:01,378
what would be incomprehensible.

899
01:29:01,754 --> 01:29:05,591
Then, like the Pelican with its little
ones,

900
01:29:05,632 --> 01:29:10,763
we will feed our children
with what we have understood.

901
01:29:13,140 --> 01:29:14,266
Remember...

902
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:18,896
this city is protected by angels.

903
01:29:23,150 --> 01:29:27,237
And the Pelican is the symbol of the
Angels.

904
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,367
From Egypt, through Saliceto,

905
01:29:31,408 --> 01:29:32,659
the Ankh key.

906
01:29:32,785 --> 01:29:34,286
Queen Ankese-pa-Aton

907
01:29:34,370 --> 01:29:36,288
and finally the Abbey of St. Michael.

908
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:38,874
Here we find the Ankh key,
but it's broken...

909
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:42,920
Arthur!

910
01:29:43,545 --> 01:29:44,797
Stay quiet!

911
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:46,507
Stay quiet!

912
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:47,925
There's nothing, here.

913
01:29:48,634 --> 01:29:49,885
Where's the key?

914
01:29:51,512 --> 01:29:53,013
Far from people like you!

915
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:54,765
What do you want?
Leave Sarah alone.

916
01:29:54,807 --> 01:29:56,809
- She has nothing to do with it.
- Tomorrow,

917
01:29:58,185 --> 01:29:59,686
at midnight,

918
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:02,815
at the fountain of Solferino Square...

919
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:05,776
Be just a minute late, and...

920
01:30:10,072 --> 01:30:12,074
I see you got it.

921
01:30:14,410 --> 01:30:15,536
The truth...

922
01:30:16,328 --> 01:30:18,539
is just in front of your eyes.

923
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:31,552
That man in black!

924
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,722
Who? What man?

925
01:30:36,181 --> 01:30:37,683
That man in black...
he took Sarah...

926
01:30:37,724 --> 01:30:39,601
Sarah? Where is she?

927
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:41,103
We've to give him what he wants.

928
01:30:41,228 --> 01:30:42,980
We've to give up...
We've to him the key.

929
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:47,359
The forces ruling the world are
far more powerful than us all.

930
01:30:48,235 --> 01:30:50,988
What I know is when
the storm is coming,

931
01:30:51,113 --> 01:30:54,491
every man must act according to
his true nature.

932
01:30:55,492 --> 01:30:57,619
Some are stuck in terror,

933
01:30:57,744 --> 01:30:59,746
some others run away or try to hide,

934
01:30:59,830 --> 01:31:01,123
some others...

935
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,834
spread their wings and start to fly...

936
01:31:07,212 --> 01:31:08,505
You're right, James.

937
01:31:09,465 --> 01:31:10,507
War can't be eliminated

938
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:13,469
but just postponed to
our enemy's advantage.

939
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,389
I'm calling Taron.

940
01:32:44,351 --> 01:32:45,811
The Pelican...

941
01:32:46,353 --> 01:32:48,814
feeds its sons with its own flesh.

942
01:32:52,859 --> 01:32:54,236
The Truth...

943
01:32:54,319 --> 01:32:57,990
can be seen only through the eyes of
death.

944
01:32:59,741 --> 01:33:03,996
But it must be illuminated
by the sun at its highest peak.

945
01:33:20,762 --> 01:33:22,014
The Truth

946
01:33:24,141 --> 01:33:25,851
is just in front of your eyes.

947
01:33:29,021 --> 01:33:30,731
21st June 2033

948
01:33:30,772 --> 01:33:33,609
Summer Solstice - 11.59 p.m.
Midnight.

949
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:36,862
Regulus, the diamond of the sky,

950
01:33:36,903 --> 01:33:41,158
shines with the brightest splendor
at the Summer Solstice. .

951
01:33:41,241 --> 01:33:44,995
The constellation of the Lion...
The facade of the Church...

952
01:33:45,537 --> 01:33:47,664
The path of the Worthy.

953
01:33:47,914 --> 01:33:50,125
Special places in the city.

954
01:33:50,167 --> 01:33:52,919
The masters of the XIX century
have shaped Turin

955
01:33:53,045 --> 01:33:56,173
with some important monuments
linked to the symbols of magic.

956
01:33:56,673 --> 01:33:58,550
Like in the Book
of the Fondazione of Edfu.

957
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,010
The Seven Sages...

958
01:34:00,677 --> 01:34:01,887
I must look for these places,

959
01:34:01,928 --> 01:34:04,681
as if the entire town was
a great philosophical abode...

960
01:34:06,183 --> 01:34:09,519
Angels replace the Egyptian gods...

961
01:34:16,443 --> 01:34:18,445
I told you to come alone!

962
01:34:20,822 --> 01:34:23,075
What are your friends doing over there?

963
01:34:23,909 --> 01:34:26,286
Now everything will be worse for you.

964
01:34:30,082 --> 01:34:31,792
No one can cover your back!

965
01:34:31,833 --> 01:34:33,710
- Go, go, go!
- Hurry up...

966
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,837
or your friend is going to die
before sunrise!

967
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:36,963
Where should I go?

968
01:34:37,047 --> 01:34:39,091
You must find Bosch's pelican!

969
01:34:39,966 --> 01:34:45,222
Only when you are as innocent
as a dove and as wise as a snake,

970
01:34:45,305 --> 01:34:47,974
can you hope to find the Truth.

971
01:34:49,059 --> 01:34:50,977
But the painting is in Berlin,
not here...

972
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:53,063
Where can I find a pelican in Turin?

973
01:34:53,105 --> 01:34:55,857
Maybe, he mean something else...

974
01:34:56,566 --> 01:34:57,609
Yeah.

975
01:35:05,867 --> 01:35:08,829
This city is protected by the angels.

976
01:35:09,329 --> 01:35:11,873
I've already been to the Angelic
Fountain... Nothing! Nothing!

977
01:35:11,998 --> 01:35:13,375
An ancient legend...

978
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:17,754
talks about an angel flying above
Europe through Turin...

979
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:22,634
SALIGIA.
Remember this clearly:

980
01:35:22,718 --> 01:35:25,137
the Latin acronym of the seven deadly
sins!

981
01:35:25,220 --> 01:35:28,390
Every titan wants to go back
to his original state

982
01:35:28,515 --> 01:35:30,851
to the divine creature he once was.

983
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:34,396
Here the Zed is inserted
in the Ankh key...

984
01:35:35,272 --> 01:35:38,233
Someone is using An' to spread his
wisdom. ..

985
01:35:39,151 --> 01:35:42,904
And Art is like a breath
of wind bringing change.

986
01:35:43,780 --> 01:35:48,493
The Truth can't be revealed all at once.

987
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:52,664
Statuto Square! Yes!
I must reach Statuto Square.

988
01:35:54,416 --> 01:35:56,126
There is another angel, over there!

989
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,004
A dove and a snake, together.

990
01:36:02,132 --> 01:36:05,761
Dove and snake, together.
The angel of the metamorphosis:

991
01:36:06,261 --> 01:36:09,306
the snake becoming a dove and flying
away.

992
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:13,935
It's Lucifer, the Angel bearer
of the light... The star.

993
01:36:14,561 --> 01:36:18,190
The Angel with his feet on the rocks
and his head in the sky...

994
01:36:18,273 --> 01:36:19,316
Yes!

995
01:36:20,066 --> 01:36:22,319
Damn it, I can't find the pelican here!

996
01:36:25,572 --> 01:36:27,783
No, it's not the pelican!

997
01:36:29,201 --> 01:36:31,077
What is he looking at?

998
01:36:33,288 --> 01:36:35,957
Yes, the Great Mother.

999
01:36:43,298 --> 01:36:46,301
On the right, a man is holding
the Tables of the Law,

1000
01:36:46,802 --> 01:36:50,180
on the left there is Charity,
with an angel looking at the chalice,

1001
01:36:50,222 --> 01:36:54,810
the Sacred Grail, the Christ, the
Pelican...

1002
01:36:54,851 --> 01:36:57,437
who feeds his sons with his own flesh.

1003
01:37:22,254 --> 01:37:23,839
No!

1004
01:37:32,264 --> 01:37:33,765
It's impossible! Nicholas...

1005
01:37:34,015 --> 01:37:36,601
Another angel is flying away...

1006
01:37:44,109 --> 01:37:46,152
Sarah, where are you?

1007
01:37:50,615 --> 01:37:53,535
Some are stuck in terror,

1008
01:37:53,618 --> 01:37:56,162
some others run away or try to hide,

1009
01:37:56,246 --> 01:37:57,622
some others...

1010
01:37:57,664 --> 01:38:00,500
spread their wings and start to fly.

1011
01:38:07,799 --> 01:38:08,925
Sarah!

1012
01:39:56,157 --> 01:39:57,367
Father!

1013
01:40:00,870 --> 01:40:05,375
I am Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow...

1014
01:40:07,043 --> 01:40:11,923
I have the Power to give life back.

1015
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:16,803
Father, I understand... finally.

1016
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:18,680
What's happening?

1017
01:40:21,307 --> 01:40:25,770
The the flying angel is
the Angel of the Tower.

1018
01:40:26,563 --> 01:40:30,150
There was once an angel
of the tower... on top of it.

1019
01:40:30,817 --> 01:40:32,569
He fell because of a storm...

1020
01:40:35,905 --> 01:40:40,410
The angelic fountain, Lucifer,
the Grail, the Pelican,

1021
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:43,913
the Angel looking at the Grail
held by a dreaming woman.

1022
01:40:43,955 --> 01:40:47,542
No... No, she's looking at
the Angel on the Tower!

1023
01:40:48,960 --> 01:40:50,420
I'm Lucifer,

1024
01:40:51,588 --> 01:40:53,798
I am Osiris and Horus

1025
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:55,800
searching for the Light.

1026
01:40:55,842 --> 01:40:57,343
I can't believe it!

1027
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:59,095
It's like the old cathedrals.

1028
01:41:00,972 --> 01:41:04,059
This city is a great open-sky sanctuary!

1029
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,187
The Antonelliana Tower,
it's a portal to the Light!

1030
01:41:07,604 --> 01:41:09,814
It's like the Sphinx in the Plain of
Giza!

1031
01:41:09,856 --> 01:41:11,816
The Angel! The Angel was over there!

1032
01:41:23,495 --> 01:41:24,829
Finally...

1033
01:41:24,871 --> 01:41:28,583
the way to Paradise.

1034
01:41:30,210 --> 01:41:31,377
Let's go!

1035
01:42:27,934 --> 01:42:31,813
It's a star. It stands for knowledge.

1036
01:42:35,066 --> 01:42:38,319
Once, there was a winged genius,
up there...

1037
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:40,780
an angel of fire.

1038
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:45,827
He was a protector of secrets.

1039
01:42:46,911 --> 01:42:49,581
Those secrets that could not be
revealed.

1040
01:42:59,591 --> 01:43:02,927
It has been hidden
at the base of the genius.

1041
01:43:04,596 --> 01:43:06,931
They didn't want it to be found.

1042
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:08,683
Because if revealed,

1043
01:43:08,725 --> 01:43:11,227
that knowledge ill use... could...

1044
01:43:13,688 --> 01:43:17,483
it could crush the world...
the world as we know it.

1045
01:43:17,567 --> 01:43:20,236
But should the Knowledge
belong to everybody.

1046
01:43:22,864 --> 01:43:24,490
Some people don't think so.

1047
01:43:25,116 --> 01:43:28,870
They had the angel struck down by
thunder.

1048
01:43:29,871 --> 01:43:31,998
So the secret was concealed...

1049
01:43:32,999 --> 01:43:34,500
I don't understand.

1050
01:43:37,253 --> 01:43:39,464
Two different forces are working
together.

1051
01:43:40,381 --> 01:43:42,217
They have concealed the secret...

1052
01:43:44,510 --> 01:43:47,096
in the tower, once more.

1053
01:43:47,639 --> 01:43:49,515
The star of Knowledge.

1054
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:52,894
The highest point in town.

1055
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:56,022
It's still there!

1056
01:43:59,025 --> 01:44:00,401
It's still there...

1057
01:44:02,528 --> 01:44:04,530
waiting for someone to find it...

1058
01:44:04,614 --> 01:44:06,532
and to decide...

1059
01:44:07,659 --> 01:44:10,036
if to keep it or to show it to the
world...

1060
01:44:10,161 --> 01:44:11,287
Hey!

1061
01:44:13,998 --> 01:44:15,124
Don't do it!

1062
01:44:15,625 --> 01:44:17,168
No! Don't do it!

1063
01:44:28,763 --> 01:44:30,181
You, bastard!

1064
01:44:34,435 --> 01:44:35,687
Why?

1065
01:44:53,204 --> 01:44:54,664
Are you ok?

1066
01:44:54,956 --> 01:44:56,165
Are you feeling all right?

1067
01:44:56,207 --> 01:44:57,583
Are you hurt?

1068
01:44:58,167 --> 01:45:00,461
It's ok. I've just slipped. Thank you.

1069
01:45:01,713 --> 01:45:02,797
Lucy.

1070
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:05,550
Let's go.

1071
01:45:06,467 --> 01:45:07,677
It's time.

1072
01:45:10,555 --> 01:45:11,848
I've to go.

1073
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:05,151
Do you know how to use the key?

1074
01:46:05,401 --> 01:46:06,903
What does it open?

1075
01:46:07,779 --> 01:46:10,031
If you don't know what to do,
just leave the key here.

1076
01:46:11,157 --> 01:46:13,785
Someone more deserving than you
will continue the quest.

1077
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:20,792
You must to learn
to ask the right questions.

1078
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:26,547
Only then, you will really
receive an answer.

1079
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:30,927
Must the key be reconstituted

1080
01:46:31,010 --> 01:46:32,553
or should it be left broken?

1081
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:42,146
Is man ready to reconstitute it?

1082
01:46:42,897 --> 01:46:44,565
This is the right question.

1083
01:46:47,151 --> 01:46:48,569
A whole key could...

1084
01:46:48,653 --> 01:46:51,197
reveal some...

1085
01:46:51,322 --> 01:46:54,325
ill-timed surprises!

1086
01:46:55,076 --> 01:46:56,702
If man is not ready...

1087
01:46:57,161 --> 01:46:58,579
Who is the guardian?

1088
01:47:02,417 --> 01:47:03,960
You are the guardian.

1089
01:47:06,712 --> 01:47:08,589
Your heart is pure now.

1090
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:11,968
We're here.

1091
01:47:14,429 --> 01:47:15,847
You may pass.

1092
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:16,616
Arthur!

1093
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:20,661
Let's go.

1094
01:49:02,286 --> 01:49:04,830
Give me the key.
It's my turn to go ahead.

1095
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:07,333
No, we must go all together.

1096
01:49:07,959 --> 01:49:09,961
I told you to give me the key.

1097
01:49:10,586 --> 01:49:12,588
Taron, what are you doing?

1098
01:49:12,713 --> 01:49:14,340
Shut up, old man!

1099
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:17,301
The key!

1100
01:49:18,302 --> 01:49:19,345
The key!

1101
01:49:21,722 --> 01:49:22,848
The key!

1102
01:49:25,560 --> 01:49:27,853
Bastard, now I understand!

1103
01:49:28,729 --> 01:49:30,856
War can't be eliminated,

1104
01:49:31,732 --> 01:49:35,111
but just postponed to our enemy's
advantage.

1105
01:49:35,987 --> 01:49:37,363
Houzzai!

1106
01:49:37,822 --> 01:49:39,115
Houzzai!

1107
01:49:39,740 --> 01:49:40,992
Houzzai!

1108
01:50:12,023 --> 01:50:13,858
James, are you ok?

1109
01:50:16,277 --> 01:50:18,112
Don't worry about me.

1110
01:50:18,904 --> 01:50:21,490
Go on, I will join you later.

1111
01:50:21,657 --> 01:50:25,494
- We must go on, it's vital!
- Go, what are you waiting for'?

1112
01:50:26,662 --> 01:50:28,914
- I am fine... don't worry.
- Ok, let's go.

1113
01:51:07,536 --> 01:51:08,954
No!

1114
01:51:19,465 --> 01:51:23,177
You can't win, you have to give up.

1115
01:51:25,179 --> 01:51:27,306
Maybe ...

1116
01:51:27,348 --> 01:51:29,975
you'll have some hope.

1117
01:51:31,477 --> 01:51:32,687
Then?

1118
01:51:42,863 --> 01:51:44,490
Only if you give up---

1119
01:51:44,615 --> 01:51:47,368
can still have hope.

1120
01:51:55,000 --> 01:51:56,627
You are not real.

1121
01:51:57,253 --> 01:51:58,713
You can't hurt me.

1122
01:52:32,872 --> 01:52:33,914
Arthur!

1123
01:52:35,166 --> 01:52:36,542
Arthur!

1124
01:52:45,134 --> 01:52:46,302
Sarah.

1125
01:53:14,455 --> 01:53:15,706
Are you ok?

1126
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:18,083
Yes it's fine!

1127
01:53:18,709 --> 01:53:19,835
Could you give me the light?

1128
01:53:19,960 --> 01:53:22,087
Sure, here you are.

1129
01:54:47,798 --> 01:54:49,550
The Gate of the Duat.

1130
01:54:50,301 --> 01:54:52,928
The Gate of Heaven for the pure of
head.

1131
01:54:53,429 --> 01:54:54,889
The key of the Gods.

1132
01:54:55,306 --> 01:54:58,392
Those who hold it,
are the masters of life and death.

1133
01:56:17,763 --> 01:56:19,098
Man...

1134
01:56:19,139 --> 01:56:22,476
know yourself and become God.

1135
01:56:42,538 --> 01:56:46,000
Keep it with you,
until the right time comes.

1136
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:57,052
It's yours.

1137
01:56:57,136 --> 01:56:59,179
Your time.

1138
01:57:21,910 --> 01:57:24,204
The way of Horus is still operating.

1139
01:57:25,789 --> 01:57:28,584
Traces have been found
in the Italian branch

1140
01:57:28,667 --> 01:57:31,462
of the most important Egyptian
Museum, after Cairo...
