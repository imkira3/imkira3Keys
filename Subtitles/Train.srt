Keep him away from your body.

00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,690
Damn it.

- How's she doing?
- Sex and violence.

14
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,430
That's what it's all about.

15
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,350
Fuck.

16
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,140

Shocker.

American, no hard
feelings, huh?

20
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,460
You don't play fair.

21
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,300
Oh, you're upset.

22
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:08,060
Screw you, you
uncircumcised little fuck.

My peace offering.

00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,410
What's that?

A party.

26
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:18,690
Here we celebrate

33
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,960
Hey, Coach, uh, listen--

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,440
Shut up.

35
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,760
When you win, you can talk.

Night.

45
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:15,150
- Thank you.

46
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,230
So, you and me?

47
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,470
Yeah. No, not gonna happen.

48
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:26,870
All right?
l'm only doing this for Alex.

49
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,660
Baby, it was one match.

50
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,700
You know you're
better than her.

51
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,420
You could easily
tear her face off...

52
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,180
if you wanted to.

53
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,220
But what if l don't want to?

54
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,260
Look...

55
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,660
you are really, really good
at this, you know?

56
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,660
You can go pro.

57
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,020
l just...

58
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:50,860

You got pinned, that's all.

60
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,810
l'm quitting the team.

61
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,410
l know what you need.

62
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,930
You need to learn
the Todd Patterson...

63
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,370
invincible double-leg
double-hook throw.

64
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,330
- What?
- Go.

65
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,770
Now spread your legs.

66
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,090
Grab my neck.

67
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,090
Spread again.

68
00:06:15,170 --> 00:06:17,560
- What?
- Now pull me down.

69
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,560
See? lt works.

70
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,840
Okay, you gotta let--
Let go now.

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,880
l'm coming up.

72
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,760
l said spread 'em.

73
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,360
God, you are so beautiful.

74
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,670
Blue eyes, do you always
get this excited...

75
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:46,670
when you pin someone?

76
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:48,670
You betcha.

77
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:57,790
Okay. Let's go.

78
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:04,230
Come on.

Freedom.

80
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,900
Where do you think
you're going, hmm?

81
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,780
Ooh, look at that.

82
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,060
11:10.
Long after lights out.

83
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:22,020
We just wanted to get
some fresh air, that's all.

84
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,420
ls that weed?

85
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,930
We won't tell if you won't.

86
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,610
Where are you really heading?

87
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,410
- To get some fresh air.
- To a party.

88
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:37,690

lt's a fresh-air party.

90
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:43,170
Well, then...

91
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,250
let's go.

92
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:53,010
lt should be straight ahead,
one more block.

93
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,480
Guys, where is this place?

94
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,600
Uh, it's 'Kanyazborst' and...

95
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,000
'Naza-vee-see-mostov.'

96
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,070
All right, thanks.

97
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:27,350
Oh, my God.

98
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,950
Dude, brace yourself.

99
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:43,910
You're gonna kiss...

100
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,430
my mother-fucking
feet after this.

101
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:47,420
Man, what have
you done now, huh?

102
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
Jesus.

103
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,280
No. No, l can't do this.

104
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
Hey, we should go.
lt's late.

105
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,150
Did you have fun up there?

106
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:08,430
Claire, come on.

107
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,590
Claire.

108
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,030
American, where
are you going to?

109
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,510
We're in the
middle of the fun.

110
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,430
Claire, you coming?

111
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,630
No. She said l'll
take care of her.

112
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:24,150
What the hell are you
talking about, man, huh?

113
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,310
- Claire, come on.
- l say she stay.

114
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,780
What's your problem?

115
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,940
Claire.

116
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,260
Get your fucking hands off me.

117
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,420
Hey, we just wanna leave.

118
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,020
You wanna fight, huh?

119
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,060
You didn't get enough
mat for breakfast?

120
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,140
Todd-- Todd, don't do this.

121
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,890
American.

122
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:08,290
Hey.

123
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,930
Hey, why are you mad at me?

124
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,010
l had no choice.

125
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:13,730
Uh, yes, that's exactly
what you had, a choice,

126
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:14,970
and you chose to fight.

127
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,970
You could have avoided this.

128
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,400
Okay, wait.

129
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,560
l think we're very,
very close here.

130
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
What time is it?

131
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:49,150
You're all pathetic.

132
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:50,670
Bunch of losers.

133
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,150
You know what your problem is?

134
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,790
You're not athletes.

135
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:56,030
You have no idea
what team spirit is.

136
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:58,790
All you do is think
about yourselves.

137
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,670
Well, you know what?

138
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:00,910
l hope last night
was worth it,

139
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:03,150
'cause you just risked
the entire tournament,

140
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,150
not to mention your future.

141
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,750
Coach, l'm so sorry.

142
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:08,780
And you.

143
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,260
Odessa.

144
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,220
We need to get to
Odessa, the Ukraine.

145
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
Odessa.

146
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,260
Doesn't anybody speak
English in this country?

147
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,260
ls there a manager back there
that speaks English?

148
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,940
Eng--

149
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,700
Odessa.

150
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,700
Excuse me.

151
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,210
l couldn't help but
hear your predicament.

152
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:39,170
l might have a
solution for you.

153
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,290
Oh, really?

154
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,570
The train l'm on
reaches Odessa.

155
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,210
Can you please tell
this...lady...

156
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,850
what train you're on,

157
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,450
so we can buy tickets for it?

158
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,330
You can pay on board.

159
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,770
That's how it works here
on the smaller lines.

160
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:57,010
Come on, get moving.

161
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,440
You missed one train already.
Let's go.

162
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,990
Excuse me, friend.

163
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:26,990
Are you the captain
of this ship?

164
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,990
Conductor Vasily Alexie
at your service.

165
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:33,110
Great. Well, we want
to hitch a ride...

166
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,190

00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,190

00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,350
That means we'll show you
to your compartments.

170
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,430
Okay. Great.

171
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,940
You two.

172
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,020
Rad.

173
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:36,170
Passports, please.

174
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,840
What?

175
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,520
Please give me your passport.

176
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,400
Why?

177
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
Many...

178
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,520
- Stealers.
- Steal-- Stealers.

179
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,520
- Thieves.
- Yeah.

180
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,000
Yes. Thieves.

181
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,680
We save for you.

182
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,670
Save.

183
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,590
So gross.

184
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,230
Nasty.

185
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,700
l didn't even want
you for this job.

186
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,410
And what do you know
about wrestling anyway, huh?

187
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,450
You know what, though?

188
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,690
l didn't judge you.
l gave you a chance.

189
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,930
And then you do this to me?

190
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:01,850
Wait till Dean Edwards
hears about this, my friend.

191
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,890
And you know what?

192
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:06,490
Even if we make the match,
they're all drunk.

193
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,370
Casino.

194
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:11,130
Restaurant car, parlor.

195
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:15,170
Oh, it's been remodeled
and refurbished.

196
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,920
God, this train has
got to stop moving.

197
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
l'm getting seasick.

198
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
Shall l open the window?

199
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,680
Let the ocean breeze
swiftly waft through...

200
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,640
and take away your mal de mer?

201
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,720
Oh, shut up.

202
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,000
lf this stupid party,
man, messes up...

203
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,040
my chances for going pro...

204
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,440
Hey. Are you listening?

205
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,920
- Every word.
- All right.

206
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,020
Alex?

207
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,490
Oh, my God.

208
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,160
Hello?

209
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,200
ls anybody there?

210
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,530
What do you want?

211
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:22,890
l'm sorry.

212
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:25,050
l didn't mean to frighten you.

213
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:29,370
My face has this
effect on people.

214
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,610
l thought l was alone.

215
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
May l?

216
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Uh, please.

217
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,880
l-- l didn't have a
chance to thank you...

218
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,280
for all you help
back at the station.

219
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,000
We will make it to
Odessa in time?

220
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,160
Even if we don't,

221
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,760
the rest of our team
will wait for us there, so...

222
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,550
- Oh.
- Yeah.

223
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:07,430
Where are you going to or--
or coming from?

224
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,470
l'm going home.

225
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,190
l don't like flying.

226
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,030
Call me old-fashioned,
but l love train rides.

227
00:20:20,870 --> 00:20:24,310
The only downside is...

228
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:27,500
that sometimes gets...

229
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,580
lonely.

230
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,740
Lucky.

231
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:41,260
Luck has nothing
to do with it.

232
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,340
English.
Where you from?

233
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,740
Maybe you should take
it easy there...

234
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:50,860
with the smoking, huh?

235
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:53,130
Maybe it's not your
fucking business.

236
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,330
Deal you in?

237
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,970
Um, is it even legal?

238
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,970
Sometimes.

239
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,890
Lucky for us.

240
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,930
Oh, wait, wait.

241
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,930
lt's this one here.

242
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,870
Hey, you're not
gonna charge me...

243
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:45,190
for this, are you?

244
00:21:45,190 --> 00:21:47,150
l read some stories...

245
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:49,350
in that college
regulation book...

246
00:21:49,430 --> 00:21:51,430
you won't believe.

247
00:21:52,950 --> 00:21:54,950
No.

248
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,830
Good.

249
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,870
Just relax.

250
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,510
You wanna hear
something funny?

251
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:08,340
l don't even know
your name, miss.

252
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,260
Doctor.

253
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Dr. Velislava.

254
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,260
What do l need a doctor for?

255
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:37,130
Truth or dare, Claire?

256
00:22:37,210 --> 00:22:40,210
Kiss my ass, moron.

257
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,050
You shouldn't have
said anything.

258
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,770
All right.

259
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:57,400
You asked for it.

260
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,640
Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Suck it all.

262
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,990
My turn.

263
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,630
Well...

264
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,870
You have to ask, don't you?

265
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,430
Truth or dare, geek?

266
00:23:37,430 --> 00:23:40,230
- Dare.
- Take your shirt off.

267
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,430
Oh, brother.

268
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,860
Did those hurt?

269
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,580
A little...for a second.

270
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,660
Freak.

271
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,450
lt's kinda hot.

272
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,650
Pain can be fun.

273
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:17,970
You know,

274
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,050
same nerves as pleasure.

275
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,330
Truth.

276
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:47,160
Okay.

277
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:49,570
So who do you hook up with
at the party?

278
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,700
No one.

279
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,710
Oh, come on, man.

280
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:57,840
You disappeared
for, like, an hour.

281
00:24:57,910 --> 00:25:00,710
Hey, don't be a jerk.

282
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,420
So?

283
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:08,190
No one.

284
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,750
lt's my turn, right?

285
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Mm-hmm.

286
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,590
Truth or dare?

287
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,030
Dare.

288
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:23,250
Run to the end of
the train and back.

289
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:27,770
Okay.

290
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
Naked.

291
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,220
- There you go.
- You'd like that, huh?

292
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,220
That's fine. See?
l don't have anything to hide.

293
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,890
Better not let the coach
catch you like that.

294
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,020
He's going for it.

295
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,760
All right.

296
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:56,070
- l think that'll
be far enough.

297
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:56,930
Oh, my God.

298
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,670
- You sure?
- Yeah.

299
00:25:58,670 --> 00:26:00,670
Okay.

300
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,570
lt's freezing.

301
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,740
Be right back, guys.

302
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,380
- No way.
- Unbelievable.

303
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,320
Oh, my God.

304
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,690
Hi. Excuse me.

305
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,700
Excuse me.
Sorry. Excuse me.

306
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,440
Damn it.

307
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,450
Fuck.

308
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:26,120
Guys, this isn't funny.

309
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,960
Guys?

310
00:28:41,030 --> 00:28:43,500
Look, l-- l don't
want any trouble.

311
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,490
ls anyone there?

312
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,780
What do you want?

313
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:29,710
Oh, shit.

314
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,050
You don't want to do this.

315
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,590
Stay away from me.

316
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,620
Stay away.
l'm warning you.

317
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,440
Oh, God.

318
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:14,360
He's not coming back.

319
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,060
He's playing.

320
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,660
He can't hide for too long,

321
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,660
dick hanging out and all.

322
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
l'm going to bed.

323
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,040
Yeah, me, too.

324
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,450
Looking for me?

325
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,820
Uh, no.

326
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:45,050
Todd's my best friend,
but, uh, you won't tell.

327
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:47,130
Good night.

328
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,660
Todd?

329
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,330
Todd, are you back here?

330
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,050
You shouldn't be here.

331
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,650
lt's not safe for
you in these cars.

332
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,520
l'm sorry. l'm just looking
for my boyfriend.

333
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,320
There's no one here,
as you can see.

334
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:34,530
That's the machine room.
lt's locked.

335
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,130
No one can go in, not even me.

336
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,260
Do you mind if l ask you,
was he drinking?

337
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,140
- Yeah.
- Of course.

338
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:47,150
This happens every night here,

to your compartment.

341
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,750
lf you don't find him
by morning, come to me.

342
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:01,130
l will personally help

343
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
Stop.

344
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,180
Todd.

345
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,320
- Hey.
- Willy?

346
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,820
What are you doing here?

347
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,890
Sorry.
Coach locked the door.

348
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,260
l couldn't get in.

349
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:58,270
Have you seen Todd?

350
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,070
Coach?

351
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,040
Coach?

352
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,350
l'm sure someone has a key.

353
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,410
Real smooth.

354
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,350
This proves nothing.

355
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,120
He's probably off
training his golden boy.

356
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,060
Yeah, with his luggage
and toothbrush.

357
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,130
Excuse me.

358
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
Todd?

359
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,900
Hey, yo.
Come on. Todd.

360
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:39,000
Hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing, huh?

361
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,940
Let go. l'm looking
for my boyfriend.

362
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,310
Let go.
Don't touch me.

363
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,280
Let me-- Let go.

364
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,810
No, you look.
This is not America.

365
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,010
You're scaring the
other passengers.

366
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,880
lf you don't stop,

367
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,790
l'll confine you
to a locked compartment.

368
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,590
You said you'd help.

369
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:00,190
And l will.

370
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,890
Take her to her room
and stay there.

371
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:06,030
l'll have my crew
search the train.

372
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,040
That's all that l can do.

373
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,270
Thank you.

374
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,580
l'll be right back.

375
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,640
Hey, the conductor said--...

376
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,720
...wait.

377
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,350
Bad boy.

378
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:05,540
- Ow.
- See? Got a point.

379
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,080
- That's how it works.
- That's how it works?

380
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,780
- Yeah.
- How's that?

381
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,360
This is ridiculous.
l'm gonna look for Todd.

382
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,320
The guy said--
You need to relax--

383
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,820
Claire, stop, all right?
He should be back by now.

384
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,190
l'm not just gonna
sit and wait.

385
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,290
Well, the crew said...

386
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,990
they were looking
for him, right--

387
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,530
What if they're not
looking for him?

388
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,530
What if the
conductor sees you?

389
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:29,170
He's not.

390
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:35,300
Okay, wait.
l'm coming.

391
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,150
Fine, fine.

392
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:27,890
Oh, my God.

393
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:39,600
What the fuck is that?

394
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:41,670
He's not in there.

395
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,240
The conductor said
that's the machine room.

396
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,610
lt's locked.

397

400
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:53,000

Okay.

409
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,990
No, no.

410
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,480

411
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:25,710
Hold that.

Oh, God.

437

Let's get out of here.

438
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:30,320
Holy mother of God.

439
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:33,530
Claire.

440
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,080

00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,320
- What about Claire?
- There's nothing we can do.

448
00:48:30,090 --> 00:48:31,920
We have to jump, now.

449
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:33,450
The fall will kill us.

450

He's coming. He's coming.

There's nobody there.

No way.
They were there.

457
00:49:55,370 --> 00:49:57,370
Oh, shit.

458

Come. Let's not do this here.

What the hell is wrong
with you people?

Why are you doing this?

462

00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,500
No.

or my body's rejecting it,
or l don't know what.

479
01:04:26,150 --> 01:04:28,320
But l do know that
my family paid enough money...

480
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,780
to give me a few more
fucking painkillers.

481
