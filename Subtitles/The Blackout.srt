2
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:50,375
Eddie.

3
00:02:50,376 --> 00:02:54,375
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Who is that?

4
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:56,839
No, no, no, no, no, no...

5
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,647
Babe, the sexiest thing I
could've done is check her pulse.

6
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:04,391
Jenny. Jenny. Jenny, come on.

7
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:05,447
Just clam down.

8
00:03:05,448 --> 00:03:07,847
Give me a second to smoke a bowl, and figure
out what the hell happened last night.

9
00:03:07,848 --> 00:03:09,831
I can't do this anymore, Eddie.

10
00:03:09,832 --> 00:03:11,976
Don't. The band's signing papers.
We're going on tour today.

11
00:03:11,977 --> 00:03:14,535
Yeah. All the more reason
we should cut our losses.

12
00:03:14,536 --> 00:03:16,776
Nothing happened in there. I swear.

13
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:19,975
I could swear too. Don't fucking
text me, don't fucking call me,

14
00:03:19,976 --> 00:03:23,656
don't even tweet about me,
just don't even think about me.

15
00:03:23,657 --> 00:03:25,551
Facebook?

16
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:29,831
Jenny, come on. Jenny!

17
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:32,079
This is all just a misunderstanding.

18
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,791
Oh, my god.

19
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:32,278
Jesus.

20
00:04:34,151 --> 00:04:37,494
Hmm...

21
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:21,759
Well, this can't get any worse.

22
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:36,899
Toss?

23
00:05:43,655 --> 00:05:47,783
Hey Toss. Hey buddy.

24
00:05:47,784 --> 00:05:50,951
Toss! Come on, buddy.

25
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:54,727
Hey man, Toss!

26
00:05:54,728 --> 00:05:58,472
No, no, no.

27
00:05:58,473 --> 00:06:01,150
No!

28
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:19,527
- I thought you are dead.
- Oh. You mean I'm not?

29
00:06:19,528 --> 00:06:22,863
- What did we do last night?
- Oh...

30
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:25,775
I'll tell you what we didn't do.

31
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,878
Oh...

32
00:06:32,871 --> 00:06:34,183
Enough for coke.

33
00:06:34,184 --> 00:06:37,159
- Shit got a little out of hand last night.
- AIDS...

34
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,351
got a little out of hand
compared to what happened here.

35
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:43,207
Dude, I can't remember anything.

36
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,479
At some point, I...

37
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,167
triple jumped the line between
award show drunk and Hasselhoff.

38
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:51,087
Oh...

39
00:06:51,752 --> 00:06:53,959
Who took a shit in your mouth?

40
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:58,565
Chas. Who else? Fucking asshole.

41
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:01,127
- Jenny broke up with me.
- Oh, cool.

42
00:07:01,128 --> 00:07:04,071
No. Not cool.

43
00:07:04,072 --> 00:07:05,927
Chas fucked this stripper
in my room last night,

44
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:07,943
and she's still there. Jenny
walked in, and just assumed...

45
00:07:07,944 --> 00:07:10,535
- You hit that?
- What? No!

46
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:13,607
You should've woke her with wood, she
would've thought you were Chas, right?

47
00:07:13,608 --> 00:07:15,175
You want Chas' sloppy seconds?

48
00:07:15,176 --> 00:07:17,915
- Can't get more Herpes.
- That's not true.

49
00:07:22,344 --> 00:07:25,671
Last thing I remember is... dinner.

50
00:07:25,672 --> 00:07:30,438
I don't remember the
last thing I remember.

51
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:46,391
You know, my back hurts, from carrying
you every time we try to have fun.

52
00:07:53,288 --> 00:07:56,871
...what you want me to do.
If you are hungry, eat.

53
00:07:56,872 --> 00:08:00,175
- They wouldn't wait for you.
- That's my fucking point, Toss.

54
00:08:02,663 --> 00:08:05,287
- Why are you looking at them?
- I don't know.

55
00:08:05,288 --> 00:08:09,191
Why are you making such a big
deal out of nothing? As usual.

56
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,159
Well, that was a little
more heated than usual.

57
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,399
Yeah, she must be ride
on the cotton pony.

58
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,383
- Why do you always assume...
- Shush... men are talking.

59
00:08:18,384 --> 00:08:22,279
Alright, let's not take your
frustrations... on my girl.

60
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:26,981
She was about to side with her even though
you both know that she's bat shit crazy!

61
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,115
- I was simply trying to...
- Shut up!

62
00:08:29,116 --> 00:08:32,807
- Hey! That's enough, man.
- No, it's fine.

63
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:36,398
- I'm just gonna check on Beth.
- I'm sorry.

64
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:41,839
Toss! Treat my girl
with some respect, man.

65
00:08:48,296 --> 00:08:50,599
- Ladies.
- It's about fucking time.

66
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,711
Dinner's been over for an hour.
But dig in, boys.

67
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:55,783
We were at Crazy Girls
with boobs. Now we're here.

68
00:08:55,784 --> 00:08:59,655
Did I ever tell you fags
about the time I was

69
00:08:59,656 --> 00:09:04,615
balls deep in the two hole of this little
Asian bird right here on this very table?

70
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:07,399
- What was his name?
- Ha ha ha.

71
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:09,959
Forgive us. Most of your
stories start that way.

72
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,551
That is because I have a
pornographic memory, my friend.

73
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,855
Chas, nobody wants to
hear about your sexual...

74
00:09:14,856 --> 00:09:17,735
- Disappointments.
- Speak for yourselves.

75
00:09:17,736 --> 00:09:22,343
I love hearing this stuff.
It's hot, very sexy.

76
00:09:22,344 --> 00:09:24,779
Sometimes I jerk off.

77
00:09:25,768 --> 00:09:27,655
What? I'm lonely.

78
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:30,759
All right, you know what?
Why don't we put this to a vote?

79
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:36,566
How many people here, actually,
want to hear this bullshit? Show hands.

80
00:09:36,904 --> 00:09:39,111
Thank you. Great! Now we
don't have to hear about

81
00:09:39,112 --> 00:09:41,511
your quest to defile a girl
in every room of this house.

82
00:09:41,512 --> 00:09:45,127
- Not fair. Birds can't vote.
- Go fuck yourself, Chas.

83
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:47,049
I already have. Twice.

84
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,736
But you know, I've got just enough
juice left to get that last room.

85
00:09:49,737 --> 00:09:52,871
Oh, there's a reason,
why it's the last room.

86
00:09:52,872 --> 00:09:57,430
- I'll get in. I always do.
- I bet you say that to all the boys.

87
00:09:57,831 --> 00:10:02,183
If I were you, I will choose my next
word very carefully, my friend.

88
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,446
Because I can do worse than what everyone
hears through your walls and their nightmares.

89
00:10:05,447 --> 00:10:09,031
Well, I think we all
know you can do better.

90
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,351
- Right?
- Is that a joke?

91
00:10:13,352 --> 00:10:16,359
Listen, if I'm fully drunk,

92
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,943
and she's half attractive,
then she's fully attractive.

93
00:10:19,944 --> 00:10:24,007
You know, if Heath Ledger did that
kind of math, then he'd still be alive.

94
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:25,607
Gees!

95
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:28,134
Was he gonna do math...

96
00:10:28,135 --> 00:10:31,943
- Just somebody call a punch before I do.
- Easy, love.

97
00:10:31,944 --> 00:10:35,655
- We just having a spot of fun.
- Yeah, fun. Anyone having a blast?

98
00:10:35,656 --> 00:10:38,983
You know, I think we all be a little bit
off spirit tonight. How you ladies doing?

99
00:10:38,984 --> 00:10:41,343
- Em, time of my fucking life.
- I'm thrilled to be here.

100
00:10:41,344 --> 00:10:46,215
Kinda night you just wanna wrap
your lips around cold steel.

101
00:10:46,216 --> 00:10:48,679
Is she going on tour with us?

102
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,295
- I would, but you'd will there, so...
- So, great.

103
00:10:52,296 --> 00:10:55,431
- This might be fun after all.
- Chas.

104
00:10:55,432 --> 00:10:57,559
You've been a dick ever
since I decided to sleep

105
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,911
- the guitarist instead of you.
- God...

106
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:02,599
Love, I've always been a dick.

107
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,151
And you see, the thing about
dicks, is that they attract pussy.

108
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:09,447
And the biggest dick,
gets the most pussy.

109
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:12,583
And let's face it. You've never
seen a bigger dick than this,

110
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,919
and poor little Eddie here,
I mean, he's the rhythm guitar.

111
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,711
- Chas.
- What?

112
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:20,999
For the love of god, I'll super
glue your cock your taint. Again.

113
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,743
- Is that a promise?
- Well, I think it's time to powder my nose.

114
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:27,042
Wait, you got coke?

115
00:11:29,383 --> 00:11:31,318
Too soon?

116
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,210
Too late.

117
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,855
We've got company.

118
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:47,175
What's he so pissed about?
He does play rhythm guitar.

119
00:11:47,176 --> 00:11:48,807
I hate my life.

120
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:50,307
Jenny.

121
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,375
One two, cha cha cha...

122
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:56,775
Are you guys expecting company?

123
00:11:56,776 --> 00:11:58,791
Just few of our closest
friends, friend.

124
00:11:58,792 --> 00:12:01,063
- Really?
- Really.

125
00:12:01,064 --> 00:12:03,782
- You invited them.
- Oh, dude, I invited some people.

126
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:05,831
- We invited he invites some people.
- Wonderful.

127
00:12:05,832 --> 00:12:08,647
Guys, this just supposed
to be a dinner party.

128
00:12:08,648 --> 00:12:13,415
Yeah, well uh, we had
dinner, so, let's party.

129
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:15,139
Right!

130
00:12:16,392 --> 00:12:19,151
Get out of the way.

131
00:12:21,096 --> 00:12:22,599
Key's in the kitchen.

132
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,426
You... Ah! I'm so glad you made it.

133
00:12:28,231 --> 00:12:32,021
I'll find you in a
little while, all right?

134
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:35,454
Get drunk.

135
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:44,039
- Chas.
- What?

136
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,294
I though we had a understanding. What
happen to a quiet night amongst friends?

137
00:12:48,295 --> 00:12:52,799
Friends? I fucking hate you.

138
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,182
Jenny?

139
00:13:01,127 --> 00:13:03,558
That's it.

140
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,351
Movie's over.

141
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:08,022
Most of that was news to me.

142
00:13:09,607 --> 00:13:13,127
- Did we sign our contract last night?
- I have no fucking idea.

143
00:13:13,128 --> 00:13:16,974
- Do you remember anything else?
- I remember the Titans.

144
00:13:37,479 --> 00:13:40,054
Toss?

145
00:13:40,199 --> 00:13:42,870
Get the fuck over here.

146
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:57,031
Greatest, party,

147
00:13:57,032 --> 00:13:58,287
ever?

148
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:16,022
Dude, fuck.

149
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:20,966
- So we're fucked, and I'm going to jail.
- Look at the bright side...

150
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:24,358
Did anyone ever die
in Tommy Lee's pool?

151
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:26,503
- Yes.
- Exactly.

152
00:14:26,504 --> 00:14:28,519
Ultimate street credit.

153
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,983
You can't buy that kind of...
What the fuck are you doing?

154
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:33,511
- Calling the cops?
- No, no, no, we're not going to jail.

155
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:36,653
- We're going on tour.
- What the fuck, man?

156
00:14:36,654 --> 00:14:39,319
Look, we've got a team of corporate
lawyers to deal with this shit now...

157
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,319
while we're on the road,
banging groupies two at a time.

158
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,624
Or, our public defender are sitting
around with his thumb up his ass

159
00:14:43,626 --> 00:14:47,094
while I've got a guy
ironically named Tiny up mine.

160
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:51,151
Give it...

161
00:14:53,064 --> 00:14:55,847
Re-fucking-lax bro.

162
00:14:55,848 --> 00:14:59,239
- We're somebody else's problem now.
- Are we, Toss?

163
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:04,565
Because we don't even know if Reuben came
over here last night with the contracts.

164
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:11,111
- We can call Spencer.
- Absolutely not.

165
00:15:11,112 --> 00:15:15,477
Not after what he tried to pull last
night. That much I remember clearly.

166
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:24,838
- Woo...
- Are you kidding me right now?

167
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:29,703
- Hey. Getting mad ain't gonna help.
- But getting fucked up will?

168
00:15:29,704 --> 00:15:32,509
You know what? I'm gonna wake
Reuben up. Because as usual,

169
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:36,710
- his sobriety will come in handy.
- Ha! Sobriety.

170
00:15:36,711 --> 00:15:40,815
He's taken 12 steps
at least a dozen times.

171
00:15:45,286 --> 00:15:48,782
Whit a second, Toss.
We gonna talk about this.

172
00:15:51,719 --> 00:15:54,055
Boys.

173
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:58,767
- Your house is on fire.
- I highly doubt that, Chuck.

174
00:15:59,816 --> 00:16:02,374
- That was real smooth.
- What did you expect me to do?

175
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,070
Hide the body? Go!

176
00:16:12,743 --> 00:16:16,103
- Good morning.
- That's what I thought.

177
00:16:16,104 --> 00:16:19,142
Outdoor furniture, is my specialty.

178
00:16:26,727 --> 00:16:29,862
What in the name of Oprah
happened last night?

179
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,639
I uh... don't really know.

180
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,814
This reeks of Chas.

181
00:16:35,815 --> 00:16:38,727
Hey, what time did you end up
getting outta here last night?

182
00:16:38,728 --> 00:16:41,767
I don't know. Two. Two thirty.

183
00:16:41,768 --> 00:16:45,842
I'm really sorry if we kept you up, man.
I mean, things got... a little crazy.

184
00:16:45,843 --> 00:16:49,016
No, I'm sorry. It wasn't you guys.

185
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:52,935
- I... got into a fight with Geoffrey.
- Must be going around.

186
00:16:52,936 --> 00:16:57,190
- Wait, who's Geoffrey?
- My sugar daddy.

187
00:16:57,191 --> 00:17:00,663
No offense, Chuck, but you blow through
dudes like Toss blows through blow.

188
00:17:00,664 --> 00:17:04,431
Huh! Toss wishes he could go
through that much coke, literally.

189
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:07,335
Yeah, for what it's worth
I hope you and uh...

190
00:17:07,336 --> 00:17:10,919
- Geoffrey!
- Right. Kiss and make up. Just uh...

191
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,603
- You know, not over here.
- We will, and we will.

192
00:17:14,604 --> 00:17:18,134
- Now, I don't mean to pry, but Eddie...
- What?

193
00:17:18,982 --> 00:17:22,054
I heard Jenny this morning.

194
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:26,054
Girlfriend got some lung on her.

195
00:17:26,055 --> 00:17:30,279
Oh, that, yeah. Pretty bad, man.

196
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,102
- Oh, you'll be fine.
- Thanks, Chuck.

197
00:17:32,103 --> 00:17:34,630
As you can see, I've got
my hands full here. So.

198
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:38,086
Oh, I'd be happy to help. We could
have this cleaned up in no time.

199
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:40,710
Thank you, but that is not necessary.

200
00:17:40,711 --> 00:17:42,918
- You sure honey?
- Yes!

201
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:44,871
It's totally cool.
As a matter of fact,

202
00:17:44,872 --> 00:17:48,326
the record label actually has people who
will deal with this things, so it's fine.

203
00:17:48,327 --> 00:17:51,910
- Oh. You fancy, huh?
- Yeah.

204
00:17:51,911 --> 00:17:55,139
You know it. Thank you for so
much for putting out the couch.

205
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:58,341
I really appreciate it. Take care!

206
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:02,165
- Well, if you need anything. Holla!
- Will do.

207
00:18:04,328 --> 00:18:07,974
Woo! That was refreshing.
I highly recommend it.

208
00:18:07,975 --> 00:18:12,134
But, I recommend getting high first.
Ha-ha. You got a light?

209
00:18:12,135 --> 00:18:15,239
You know, I have a hard time believe in
you can produce a joint from thin air,

210
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,446
without a way to light it.
Besides, Toss,

211
00:18:17,447 --> 00:18:20,391
I don't know whether you comprehend
this, but we have bigger problems here.

212
00:18:20,392 --> 00:18:24,134
Uh-oh, bigger than this?

213
00:18:26,535 --> 00:18:30,374
Like a dead guy out
there in the pool.

214
00:18:30,375 --> 00:18:33,622
Now I hope Gunther has some answers.

215
00:18:50,312 --> 00:18:53,822
Fuck! What's the last
time you saw Gunther?

216
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:04,039
Is that all you remember?

217
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,119
- I need more fuel.
- Fuel?

218
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,414
Yeah, every time I drink or smoke,
I remember something.

219
00:19:09,415 --> 00:19:10,886
Dude, that's state
dependent learning.

220
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:13,447
- Yeah, what he said.
- No, no, no, no, seriously.

221
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:16,302
The only way to remember a blackout,

222
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,478
is to blackout again.

223
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:23,726
Yay, science! I'm gonna
check Chas' room.

224
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:30,342
You looking for Chas or Chas' coke?

225
00:19:30,343 --> 00:19:32,582
Wow, I just got picked off first.

226
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:36,430
Well, lucky for us, I'm on second.

227
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:44,775
Typical.

228
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:47,982
He's got coke. I can smell it.

229
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,791
The only time Chas is
actually up this early is...

230
00:19:50,792 --> 00:19:53,902
- When he hasn't gone to bed.
- Exactly.

231
00:19:55,303 --> 00:19:57,830
Unbelievable.
Where are these assholes?

232
00:19:57,831 --> 00:19:59,238
We gotta find them, man.

233
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:03,191
More importantly, we gotta find
that contract or we are all fucked.

234
00:20:05,192 --> 00:20:07,142
What are those?

235
00:20:07,143 --> 00:20:10,882
- Remember me nots.
- I think you missed one.

236
00:20:18,694 --> 00:20:20,806
What's happening?

237
00:20:20,807 --> 00:20:23,093
Nothing.

238
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:27,958
Let me see.

239
00:20:30,247 --> 00:20:32,326
Woo...

240
00:20:32,327 --> 00:20:34,822
Klonopins, nice.

241
00:20:34,823 --> 00:20:36,967
Did you hurt your back
falling off the wagon?

242
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:40,006
No, I have a huge pain in the ass.

243
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:42,023
Does she know you are
doing drugs without her?

244
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:45,443
You could fill the Grand Canyon
with what she don't know about me.

245
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:54,470
You ain't gonna find what you looking
for at the bottom of this bag of pills.

246
00:20:54,471 --> 00:20:57,333
Because it ain't in there.

247
00:20:58,483 --> 00:21:00,774
Getting slow.

248
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:02,310
There you are.

249
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:05,453
Take what you want.

250
00:21:07,398 --> 00:21:09,286
I'll have fun trying.

251
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:14,055
Don't try too hard. Because the trip
back from rock bottom is a bitch.

252
00:21:14,056 --> 00:21:15,782
Look, it's' just a couple of pills.

253
00:21:15,783 --> 00:21:18,487
Just a couple pills and couple
more, I'll be pulling you trigger,

254
00:21:18,488 --> 00:21:22,790
- so you don't pulling Hendrix.
- I can handle my shit.

255
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,749
Sound like me 12 steps ago.

256
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:30,150
Twelve, eleven,

257
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:33,872
ten, nine, eight,

258
00:21:33,874 --> 00:21:39,102
seven, six, five, four...

259
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,670
...two, one.

260
00:21:41,671 --> 00:21:45,862
- Who's got the next motherfuckers?
- Right here, Sebastic Warriors.

261
00:21:45,863 --> 00:21:49,606
- Can you handle these balls?
- He's sober.

262
00:21:49,607 --> 00:21:52,455
But I'm drinking for two.
So yes, I can handle this.

263
00:21:52,456 --> 00:21:57,455
- Beer pong is foreplay.
- And you're about to get fucked.

264
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:28,774
Double or nothing.

265
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:38,169
Needs more coke.

266
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:02,245
You all right in there?

267
00:24:25,991 --> 00:24:28,302
Single tear.

268
00:24:34,759 --> 00:24:36,654
How far you gonna take it?

269
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:41,902
Full fist. No Vaseline.

270
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:49,298
David Bowie! Again.

271
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,742
- I almost save the last one for later.
- No, no, no, no.

272
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:55,430
No, no. Rock bottom, rock...
What is it?

273
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:57,926
Think John Bonham leaves fucking
shit in his dressing room?

274
00:24:57,927 --> 00:24:59,526
You think Ginger Baby didn't do this?

275
00:24:59,527 --> 00:25:02,446
You think Keith Moon
didn't do the fucking line?

276
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:11,486
Toss Dunbar on drums,
ladies and gentlemen.

277
00:25:11,815 --> 00:25:15,406
I feel like the drummer
from Def Leppard.

278
00:25:19,527 --> 00:25:22,357
What the fuck is that?

279
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:29,933
- Is that my fucking girlfriend?
- Dude, that's your girlfriend fucking.

280
00:25:36,518 --> 00:25:39,726
You ever make her to that?

281
00:25:43,462 --> 00:25:45,285
Fuck.

282
00:25:45,286 --> 00:25:48,838
It's been over for a long time, Toss.
You know it, I know it.

283
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:50,598
That half attractive dyke knows it.

284
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:53,218
- Toss, not here!
- Why not?

285
00:25:55,271 --> 00:25:57,765
- That didn't stop you at dinner.
- Fuck you, Toss.

286
00:25:57,766 --> 00:26:00,550
Fuck me? Is today my birthday?

287
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:04,422
You know what? I hope fame
does find you, I really do.

288
00:26:04,423 --> 00:26:07,590
Because you'll just fuck it up.
That's what you do.

289
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:13,870
You're just a druggie.
Fuck up. Loser.

290
00:26:17,223 --> 00:26:20,206
You... you make me want drugs.

291
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:27,014
What?!

292
00:26:27,015 --> 00:26:30,789
Hey dude. Like... we're cool, right?

293
00:26:36,102 --> 00:26:38,578
What the fuck you looking at?

294
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:42,254
This was supposed
to be a celebration.

295
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:52,990
Yes! Whoa!

296
00:26:55,847 --> 00:27:01,446
- Okay. So, what happen to Gunther?
- I don't know, it all went black.

297
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:04,166
You got all that from drinking,
smoking, and popping a few pills?

298
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:06,982
Well, yeah, and a decent buzz.

299
00:27:06,983 --> 00:27:08,966
Shato Margo, really?

300
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:13,109
- Oh, yeah. Chas eared this one.
- Wait...

301
00:27:17,606 --> 00:27:22,886
You are serious.
Yeah... get in there.

302
00:27:22,887 --> 00:27:26,278
You fill the hole that your dad
left when he walked out your life.

303
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,718
Go ahead, down the hatch.

304
00:27:34,598 --> 00:27:36,459
At least we don't fight like that.

305
00:27:38,214 --> 00:27:40,445
Right babe?

306
00:27:40,678 --> 00:27:42,653
Jenny?

307
00:27:51,718 --> 00:27:54,389
I told you I'd be there for you.

308
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:58,745
Honey? That's my drink.

309
00:28:04,646 --> 00:28:08,964
Spencer. Why don't you run along
and ruin someone else's night, suit?

310
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:12,069
Come on, Eddie. Don't be jealous.

311
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:15,253
Of what? That fashion beard?

312
00:28:16,005 --> 00:28:18,470
Seriously.

313
00:28:18,471 --> 00:28:20,646
I left two inches out so
she wouldn't fall in love.

314
00:28:20,647 --> 00:28:23,110
- Say that to me again right now.
- He's not worth it.

315
00:28:23,111 --> 00:28:26,377
Eddie, your contract is up.

316
00:28:26,406 --> 00:28:29,542
I'd love to stay and chat, buddy.

317
00:28:29,543 --> 00:28:33,077
Hmm. That's actually not true.

318
00:28:34,342 --> 00:28:37,125
I guess this beer was for my Fiance.

319
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:38,914
Yeah.

320
00:28:41,734 --> 00:28:44,134
What were you doing flirting
with that douche nozzle?

321
00:28:44,135 --> 00:28:46,502
Spencer? Please! I was insulting him.

322
00:28:46,503 --> 00:28:49,062
- Yeah, that's how you flirt.
- Don't worry about it.

323
00:28:49,063 --> 00:28:52,090
By tomorrow night you gonna
have groupies all over you.

324
00:28:56,966 --> 00:28:59,705
Not if you come with.

325
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:07,141
Look, ever since I gave Reuben your stuff,
he's taken a real interest in my career.

326
00:29:07,142 --> 00:29:09,357
That's great, babe and
I'll be here when...

327
00:29:09,358 --> 00:29:11,685
It is great. I'm finally
getting somewhere.

328
00:29:11,686 --> 00:29:15,606
I can't just, leave my life
to watch you live yours.

329
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:17,482
Jenny.

330
00:29:18,343 --> 00:29:21,406
- Baby, I want this to work.
- I...

331
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:26,034
Of my god.

332
00:29:26,535 --> 00:29:29,190
What the fuck is this? Prom?

333
00:29:29,891 --> 00:29:33,542
If it were prom, you might
be at least getting laid.

334
00:29:34,543 --> 00:29:37,542
Today just ain't your day, bro.

335
00:29:37,543 --> 00:29:40,422
Shit. I didn't remember
anything about Gunther.

336
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:44,157
But, you remembered something.

337
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:49,830
Maybe, we gotta take this,

338
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,270
to another level.

339
00:29:51,271 --> 00:29:56,198
- I don't think I have another level.
- There, there. Take your medicine.

340
00:29:56,199 --> 00:29:58,065
Come on.

341
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:00,197
You can do it. You're a big boy now.

342
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:04,149
- It's four twenty somewhere.
- Atta boy.

343
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,133
Ah yes.

344
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:12,724
Yes... to work... work.

345
00:30:13,574 --> 00:30:15,942
- I need more weed.
- Gocha, dude.

346
00:30:15,943 --> 00:30:19,470
- Come on.
- Thank you.

347
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:35,886
Who is this filthy slut? And why does
she smell like a dead homeless person?

348
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:40,294
Gunther? Oh, fuck!

349
00:30:40,295 --> 00:30:42,918
Holy, that is the sexiest thing
you could pull last night?

350
00:30:42,919 --> 00:30:45,798
- Cover it up, man!
- Yeah, you like that?

351
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:48,197
Oh, I'm gonna have me
a coupla' Minotaur kids...

352
00:30:48,198 --> 00:30:50,117
Cover it up! Cover it up.

353
00:30:50,118 --> 00:30:54,061
It's the best day of my life and
you won't even let me enjoy it?

354
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:02,421
You motherfucker.

355
00:31:02,887 --> 00:31:06,870
Well, at least someone in this
house knows how to greet me.

356
00:31:22,118 --> 00:31:23,978
Where the hell have you been?

357
00:31:24,998 --> 00:31:26,310
I'm sorry, Eddie.

358
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:29,350
I didn't realize I had to check in with
the Miss of the house before I left.

359
00:31:29,351 --> 00:31:32,805
First thing's fucking last, okay?
Do you have any coke?

360
00:31:32,806 --> 00:31:35,458
Do I look like an amateur?

361
00:31:36,646 --> 00:31:38,918
- I can murder you right now.
- For what?

362
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:41,222
- For being awesome?
- For one, there's a corpse in the pool.

363
00:31:41,223 --> 00:31:43,398
Yeah I know. I saw him when
I took my morning swim.

364
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:46,692
- What?
- What do you want me to do about it?

365
00:31:46,853 --> 00:31:50,429
I guess nothing. Just act like an asshole
as usual. That's what you good at.

366
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:55,433
Ey, mate. Look, last night was not
my fault. I was drinking whiskey.

367
00:31:56,518 --> 00:31:59,762
You know what? That's your
excuse for everything, bro.

368
00:31:59,863 --> 00:32:03,418
Looks like someone woke up on
the wrong side of the dead deer.

369
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,545
Come here! I'm gonna kill you.

370
00:32:06,214 --> 00:32:08,837
Stop it, stop it, stop it.

371
00:32:08,838 --> 00:32:11,398
Eddie, maybe we should find out
what he knows before you kill him.

372
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,566
- Jenny broke up with me because of you.
- Alright, yeah, it's because of me.

373
00:32:14,567 --> 00:32:18,214
Nothing to do with your little
penis and K.D. Lang haircut.

374
00:32:18,215 --> 00:32:20,613
Enough with the fake British accent!

375
00:32:20,614 --> 00:32:25,490
Oh, you wanna get real?
Come on, let's get real!

376
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,028
Come on.

377
00:32:38,038 --> 00:32:40,581
Fucking asshole!

378
00:32:41,958 --> 00:32:44,390
You sons of bitches.

379
00:32:44,391 --> 00:32:49,412
- Do you wanna find the contract or not?
- I don't care anymore. I fucking quit.

380
00:32:51,206 --> 00:32:53,765
I fucking quit.

381
00:32:58,598 --> 00:33:00,966
What did you do?

382
00:33:00,967 --> 00:33:02,470
Nothing.

383
00:33:27,365 --> 00:33:31,685
- Come on, have a drink with me.
- Sorry honey, you are not my type.

384
00:33:34,054 --> 00:33:35,397
Bitch.

385
00:33:35,398 --> 00:33:38,821
- Just one drink.
- Fine.

386
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:44,885
- Oh! You just spilled forty dollars.
- Beat it, nerd.

387
00:33:45,286 --> 00:33:48,813
- You again.
- Me. Again.

388
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:55,000
Why don't we go some
place and get shady?

389
00:33:57,543 --> 00:33:58,981
Oh, my god.

390
00:33:58,982 --> 00:34:01,925
What the fuck! Is this prom?

391
00:34:01,926 --> 00:34:05,289
If it were prom,
you might be getting laid.

392
00:34:20,213 --> 00:34:22,110
Get out of my way.

393
00:34:23,814 --> 00:34:27,589
Wow, you guys throw a
great party. Wish I was invited.

394
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:32,462
Yeah, it was an impromptu thing.
I have no idea it's gonna happen.

395
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:40,308
You guys told one person at the
school for the terminally hip?

396
00:34:42,566 --> 00:34:46,885
You know, I've got a better idea.

397
00:34:51,238 --> 00:34:53,785
Yeah, keep going.

398
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:17,253
Easy, easy, easy.
Business before pleasure.

399
00:35:17,254 --> 00:35:21,605
Oh, but pleasure is my business.

400
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:27,161
We forget how this works?

401
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:40,422
You, are turing into
my best customer.

402
00:35:40,423 --> 00:35:44,957
You are very welcome.

403
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:48,358
Maybe we should take a break, huh?

404
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:50,790
You can't break up with me.
You are my drug dealer.

405
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,902
You broke with me first, remember?

406
00:35:52,903 --> 00:35:56,421
- We are really going there?
- We don't have to.

407
00:35:56,422 --> 00:36:00,517
I don't have a problem. I just
need to hide my stash better.

408
00:36:00,518 --> 00:36:04,214
Yeah well, if you can't get it
up again, I'll know you are lying.

409
00:36:04,415 --> 00:36:07,158
Wanna do some ecstasy?

410
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:09,613
You got any viagra?

411
00:36:16,518 --> 00:36:18,118
Baby...

412
00:36:26,407 --> 00:36:29,638
- How about a little privacy!
- Are you serious, Chas?

413
00:36:29,639 --> 00:36:33,701
- That's lame, even for you.
- I'm going to fuc...

414
00:36:33,702 --> 00:36:37,157
Jenny, wait. Hold on, I can explain this.
Jenny, wait. Give me a second.

415
00:36:37,158 --> 00:36:40,517
This is not what it
looks like. Jenny, wait!

416
00:36:40,518 --> 00:36:44,902
Damn it, Chas. Why can't you just fuck in
your own room like a normal human being?

417
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:47,301
Do I look like a normal
human being to you?

418
00:36:47,302 --> 00:36:48,709
- This is the last time.
- Or what?

419
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,885
What? You gonna quit the band, Eddie?

420
00:36:50,886 --> 00:36:53,253
- Yeah.
- You're the rhythm guitarist.

421
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,658
I write the music, you cocksucker.

422
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:03,365
So, got any condoms?

423
00:37:03,366 --> 00:37:05,285
What's a condom?

424
00:37:07,286 --> 00:37:10,245
Looks like you gonna have to blow me.

425
00:37:10,246 --> 00:37:14,445
Does that mean I get to
tongue punch your firebox?

426
00:37:22,054 --> 00:37:27,053
Oh, Chas.

427
00:37:29,554 --> 00:37:33,849
Chas! What the fuck does
that have to do with anything?

428
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,253
Nothing. This is just a great story.

429
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,245
I'd love to hear the
girl's side of that story.

430
00:37:39,246 --> 00:37:42,394
I bet you would that's cuz
you like being lied to.

431
00:37:43,334 --> 00:37:45,669
Got any condoms?

432
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:46,990
What's a condom?

433
00:37:51,982 --> 00:37:54,913
Oh, Chas...

434
00:37:55,014 --> 00:37:57,873
Oh, Chas!

435
00:37:57,899 --> 00:38:01,870
Oh! Oh, Chas!

436
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:15,533
What are you doing?

437
00:38:16,034 --> 00:38:20,573
I'm getting ready to go out and enjoy
the party that you didn't invite me to.

438
00:38:21,974 --> 00:38:24,742
Wait...

439
00:38:24,743 --> 00:38:28,133
What about... my turn?

440
00:38:28,134 --> 00:38:31,333
Oh, it is your turn,
you selfish prick.

441
00:38:31,334 --> 00:38:32,525
Layla, wait.

442
00:38:32,526 --> 00:38:37,222
Chas, I'm done waiting. Maybe now you
can think of someone other than yourself.

443
00:38:37,223 --> 00:38:39,717
Okay, hang on. Hang on.

444
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:44,865
I've got a condom.

445
00:38:45,666 --> 00:38:49,713
Great! Now you can go fuck yourself.

446
00:38:55,525 --> 00:39:00,621
Easy, gunpowder.
Oh, a straw. Perfect.

447
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:10,725
Go fuck yourself, I mean,
hello. Hello, hey... Hey.

448
00:39:10,726 --> 00:39:12,645
Yeah.

449
00:39:13,846 --> 00:39:18,708
What? Well, I mean we can't
find Gunther, but everybody...

450
00:39:19,685 --> 00:39:22,216
Yeah, we'll all be here.

451
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:24,353
Bye, love.

452
00:39:24,549 --> 00:39:26,277
That was Spencer,

453
00:39:26,278 --> 00:39:29,753
he's on his way over here right now,
with great news about out contract.

454
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:33,989
- What the fuck does that mean?
- I'm fluent in douche. It's not good.

455
00:39:33,990 --> 00:39:38,245
Look, I'll go break
it to Eddie, okay?

456
00:39:38,246 --> 00:39:42,117
You think you can keep you little
hipster friend away from the pool?

457
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:44,741
I think I can...

458
00:39:44,742 --> 00:39:47,436
get fucked up trying.

459
00:40:20,613 --> 00:40:23,681
A little early for that, no?

460
00:40:25,733 --> 00:40:29,044
I'm already halfway to a blackout.

461
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:34,988
What makes you think
you can quit the band?

462
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:38,821
Because I'd rather not hit
the big time and be with her,

463
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:42,484
than go on tour with you assholes.

464
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:49,261
Come on, drink this one through, huh?

465
00:41:19,558 --> 00:41:22,420
You can't quit the band.

466
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:29,221
No, what I can't do, is deal with Chas'
bullshit 24/7 for the next six months.

467
00:41:29,222 --> 00:41:32,325
It's a small price to pay
for rock super stardom.

468
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:34,260
I'll kill him.

469
00:41:34,981 --> 00:41:37,221
I mean, I'm talking, literal,

470
00:41:37,222 --> 00:41:39,789
straight, fucking murder.

471
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:42,182
You think Fleetwood Mac didn't
want to kill each other? The Police?

472
00:41:42,183 --> 00:41:45,748
Those guys fucking hate each other.
But it fuels the music.

473
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:54,804
What if she's the one?

474
00:41:55,589 --> 00:41:57,785
Eduardo,

475
00:41:57,786 --> 00:42:01,093
ten years from now, Jenny may or
may not be the mother of you children.

476
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:05,093
But if you don't go on this tour,
you'll regret it for the rest of your life.

477
00:42:05,094 --> 00:42:09,556
Opportunity like this,
don't come around that often.

478
00:42:11,205 --> 00:42:13,641
Let's face facts, man.

479
00:42:14,342 --> 00:42:16,564
You destroy the guitar.

480
00:42:17,189 --> 00:42:21,541
- I write all out music, man.
- I'm fucking with you, kiddo.

481
00:42:21,542 --> 00:42:24,013
I'm with you, man.
Just fucking around.

482
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:30,592
Listen to me,

483
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:33,056
I've been around the block.

484
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:37,124
I put records out. I've been
on tour, all over world.

485
00:42:37,125 --> 00:42:42,164
This is my last shot. And I know it.

486
00:42:43,045 --> 00:42:46,292
You may never get another shot.

487
00:42:47,205 --> 00:42:50,853
And you could write a song
that could live forever.

488
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:54,085
Everyone wants to be
where you are right now.

489
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:58,420
If you wanna let that slip away
cuz you're in love with some girl,

490
00:42:58,885 --> 00:43:02,557
Cool. But just do me one favor...

491
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:09,044
Please be damn sure, that this
girl means something to you.

492
00:43:09,637 --> 00:43:12,781
- Gang bang my life.
- Yep.

493
00:43:19,525 --> 00:43:22,381
- You're right.
- I know.

494
00:43:25,957 --> 00:43:28,468
You in?

495
00:43:30,085 --> 00:43:32,028
You're in.

496
00:43:32,101 --> 00:43:34,885
Let's rock every stadium,

497
00:43:34,886 --> 00:43:39,749
take every drug, bang every
groupie, until one of us dies.

498
00:43:41,734 --> 00:43:43,397
You're sober, man.

499
00:43:43,398 --> 00:43:45,349
Yeah, it's the same goes to sex,
drugs, and Rock and Roll.

500
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:48,312
I can't leave one out because
I don't drink anymore.

501
00:43:49,862 --> 00:43:52,637
Hello.

502
00:43:53,638 --> 00:43:56,965
You are either with us,

503
00:43:56,966 --> 00:44:00,005
or you're against us.

504
00:44:00,006 --> 00:44:02,501
You think you pussies can
handle two at a time?

505
00:44:02,502 --> 00:44:06,356
Sorry, doll face. I'm sober,
and this kid is lame.

506
00:44:07,173 --> 00:44:09,996
Hi. I'm Layla.

507
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,701
Gunther Shea.

508
00:44:13,702 --> 00:44:14,725
And this...

509
00:44:14,726 --> 00:44:17,413
Is the most boring
person in the world.

510
00:44:17,414 --> 00:44:20,248
- Oh, you've met.
- Yeah.

511
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:24,869
Your hands, so petite.

512
00:44:24,870 --> 00:44:27,961
My cock's gonna look huge in this.

513
00:44:29,190 --> 00:44:33,637
Well, I think this guy is
not against you, but...

514
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:37,380
if you'll excuse me,
I gonna go find my girl.

515
00:44:37,381 --> 00:44:39,205
I told you.

516
00:44:39,206 --> 00:44:41,220
More for us, babe.

517
00:44:41,221 --> 00:44:44,645
Welcome to the
Gentlemen's Lounge, shall we?

518
00:44:44,646 --> 00:44:47,436
I love you.

519
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,245
What the fuck, Spencer?

520
00:44:54,246 --> 00:44:56,324
Why don't you take me outside
so I can teach you a lesson?

521
00:44:56,325 --> 00:44:59,148
Jenny's not here to
save you this time.

522
00:44:59,149 --> 00:45:02,853
I got six inches on you,
buddy. And I'm taller.

523
00:45:02,854 --> 00:45:07,461
- Why you have to be such a douche bag?
- That's Mr. Douche Bag to you, okay?

524
00:45:07,462 --> 00:45:10,085
But since you ask, six nights a week,

525
00:45:10,086 --> 00:45:14,116
three venues a night,
I scour this town for talent.

526
00:45:14,117 --> 00:45:18,149
And Ruben, he sees you online,
for free, while he was busy not working.

527
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:20,037
And now I have to deal
with four talentless hacks

528
00:45:20,038 --> 00:45:22,053
with a Macbook Pro and too
much time on the hands.

529
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,525
Well, why don't you tell
me how you really feel.

530
00:45:23,526 --> 00:45:26,789
I really feel that in 20 years,
you'll be still making bad music,

531
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,498
while I'll be balls deep in your girlfriend,
and sport fucking your sister on the side.

532
00:45:34,277 --> 00:45:37,925
No wonder Jenny doesn't want to
be near you right now. You stink.

533
00:45:37,926 --> 00:45:39,877
You've seen Jenny?

534
00:45:39,878 --> 00:45:42,989
Easy, tiger. This is cashmere.

535
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:46,341
Where is she, you son of a bitch?

536
00:45:46,342 --> 00:45:49,573
She needed a friend, okay?

537
00:45:49,574 --> 00:45:54,068
And as a friend, she doesn't
want to see you right now.

538
00:45:54,981 --> 00:45:56,980
Oh, hey, Reuben!

539
00:45:57,637 --> 00:46:00,852
I'm sure he'd love to see this.

540
00:46:03,141 --> 00:46:06,469
Now, if you need me,

541
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:10,496
I'll be convincing this "has been"
that you're a "never will be".

542
00:46:22,693 --> 00:46:24,757
Jenny?

543
00:46:26,469 --> 00:46:28,140
Jenny!

544
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:26,605
Oh... Come the fuck on.

545
00:47:31,238 --> 00:47:33,924
I wonder what kinda douche bag
Spencer's got in store for us.

546
00:47:33,925 --> 00:47:36,261
Dude, I don't know what I'm gonna do if
he pushes me the wrong way right now.

547
00:47:36,262 --> 00:47:39,341
- I'll do all the talking.
- Great, that's reassuring.

548
00:47:45,188 --> 00:47:50,340
Well, well, well. If it ain't
Mahoney and Tuckleberry.

549
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:52,868
Where's the black guys
does the sound effects?

550
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:56,325
One of you guys Edward Mesmerberg?

551
00:47:56,326 --> 00:47:58,853
Mesmerberg?

552
00:47:58,854 --> 00:48:01,573
Yes, I am, officers.

553
00:48:01,574 --> 00:48:03,045
Can I help you?

554
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:06,073
Yeah, we're here to investigate a
noise complaint we got this morning

555
00:48:06,074 --> 00:48:09,765
that maybe related to the
disappearance of Mr. Reuben Adler.

556
00:48:09,766 --> 00:48:12,133
What? Reuben is missing?

557
00:48:12,134 --> 00:48:15,269
Well he didn't go home last night.
And didn't show up for work this morning.

558
00:48:15,270 --> 00:48:17,868
Needless to say, a lot of important
people are worried about him.

559
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:21,764
We have reason to believe this
was the last place he was seen.

560
00:48:21,765 --> 00:48:23,956
That is the rumor.

561
00:48:25,156 --> 00:48:26,276
Oh, wait.

562
00:48:26,277 --> 00:48:28,965
Is he a grippy fat person?

563
00:48:28,966 --> 00:48:32,428
Dark hair, well-built.
Kinda Jewy-looking.

564
00:48:37,628 --> 00:48:39,256
Excuse me.

565
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:47,332
Who's your decorator? Amy Winehouse?

566
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,212
We uh... had a few
people over last night.

567
00:48:50,213 --> 00:48:52,325
That explains the noise complaints.

568
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:56,069
I don't know who complained.
I mean... the world was here.

569
00:48:56,070 --> 00:49:00,164
Yeah. According to our report we
got this morning at 4:48 AM.

570
00:49:00,165 --> 00:49:03,789
That was like, eight house ago?
You guys run by the cable company?

571
00:49:04,646 --> 00:49:08,788
Sorry, officers.
My friend here, is uh...

572
00:49:09,253 --> 00:49:11,748
- drunk.
- I'm not drunk.

573
00:49:11,749 --> 00:49:14,292
I'm a bit tipsy.

574
00:49:14,693 --> 00:49:16,804
Give me that.

575
00:49:16,805 --> 00:49:20,805
We're just getting here now because we were
gleaning evidence from Mr. Adler's car,

576
00:49:20,806 --> 00:49:22,212
which was found near LA LAX.

577
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:26,084
That evidence points to a suspect.
With a list of priors as long as my johnson.

578
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:28,467
This guy's johnson.

579
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:31,652
We spent the next four hours
hunting down said suspect,

580
00:49:31,653 --> 00:49:35,621
then the next three interrogating him.
I need you to corroborate this story.

581
00:49:35,622 --> 00:49:37,989
Yeah, um...

582
00:49:37,990 --> 00:49:42,980
Said suspect, his name doesn't
happen to be, Gunther Shea, does it?

583
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:45,989
Our suspect is Mr. James White.

584
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,484
- AKA Filipino James. You know him?
- No.

585
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:52,389
Now, see, last night was
an alcohol fueled haze.

586
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:54,021
Just like this afternoon, apparently.

587
00:49:54,022 --> 00:49:57,541
Uh excuse me, we're drinking
to remember. It's science, so...

588
00:49:57,542 --> 00:50:01,093
Right, and it's still a
little bit hazy, Officers.

589
00:50:01,094 --> 00:50:04,069
You boys wanna go to jail
for obstructing justice?

590
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:07,364
No, sir. But I'm sorry to say
we're almost out of booze.

591
00:50:07,365 --> 00:50:11,212
Why don't you collect
a few statements?

592
00:50:13,957 --> 00:50:16,500
Love to.

593
00:50:26,054 --> 00:50:26,980
Reuben's in the pool.

594
00:50:26,981 --> 00:50:30,085
- How does a grown ass man drown?
- I have no idea.

595
00:50:30,086 --> 00:50:32,620
His sorrow in alcohol.

596
00:50:35,108 --> 00:50:38,500
I'm gonna ask you kindly, son.
Put that out.

597
00:50:38,501 --> 00:50:41,509
And I'll tell you kindly...

598
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:43,781
to go fuck yourself, Dad.

599
00:50:43,782 --> 00:50:47,140
If I gotta ask again,
I'm gonna ask with this.

600
00:50:47,141 --> 00:50:50,244
Woo-hoo, I love foreplay.

601
00:50:51,845 --> 00:50:53,773
Oh... I got a prescription.

602
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:57,587
- Yeah... Let me see that prescription.
- Oh, come on.

603
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:01,636
Hey Kazansky, you getting anywhere?

604
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:04,492
I don't know. Am I?

605
00:51:06,661 --> 00:51:10,908
Hey Howie. You're not gonna
believe this shit. Get over here.

606
00:51:12,389 --> 00:51:14,405
Well, maybe we can be each
other's bitch in prison.

607
00:51:14,406 --> 00:51:17,088
Don't worry, I'm hung like a Tic Tac.

608
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,332
Hey, is that what I think it is?

609
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,284
I bought his kid one
for his birthday.

610
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:28,901
He loves the shit out of this thing.
Can't stop talking about it, for chris sakes.

611
00:51:28,902 --> 00:51:33,767
Hey, officers. Um... I think that
the prescription is in my room.

612
00:51:37,733 --> 00:51:41,508
So this is typical Monday
afternoon for you boys, huh?

613
00:51:41,509 --> 00:51:43,540
Slow Monday.

614
00:51:45,318 --> 00:51:47,081
What was that?

615
00:51:48,133 --> 00:51:50,724
What was that?

616
00:52:06,598 --> 00:52:08,957
What the hell are you guys into?

617
00:52:12,518 --> 00:52:15,716
Alright. Someone better tell me what
the hell happened here last night?

618
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:18,308
I'm getting tired at the lack of
cooperation we're getting here.

619
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:22,753
Would you please arrest me or get me out
of this because I'm gonna shit my pants.

620
00:52:23,205 --> 00:52:27,717
The next thing I remember I woke up
to my girlfriend breaking up with me.

621
00:52:28,318 --> 00:52:31,553
Because she thought I had
another girl in my bed.

622
00:52:31,554 --> 00:52:33,364
Who were you in bed with?

623
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:35,397
- A dead deer.
- What?!

624
00:52:35,398 --> 00:52:38,692
What, uh... my, uh,
associate meant today was,

625
00:52:38,693 --> 00:52:43,716
hooked up with a deer face
chick and she was really gross.

626
00:52:43,717 --> 00:52:46,340
You mean to tell me you don't
even know if Adler was here?

627
00:52:46,341 --> 00:52:50,208
Unless you've got something
stronger than this. I'm afraid not.

628
00:52:51,525 --> 00:52:53,604
Your friend here better be
able to fill in some holes.

629
00:52:53,605 --> 00:52:55,401
That's my specialty.

630
00:52:57,285 --> 00:52:59,372
He's the sober one?

631
00:53:02,886 --> 00:53:04,723
Great!

632
00:53:04,772 --> 00:53:07,400
The band's all here.

633
00:53:08,805 --> 00:53:13,316
Pardon me, Officers. I'm Spencer
Bayne, Esquire. I'm with the label.

634
00:53:13,317 --> 00:53:15,269
Mind if I have a quick little
band meeting with the guys?

635
00:53:15,270 --> 00:53:16,708
- Please.
- Thanks.

636
00:53:16,709 --> 00:53:19,876
Fellas, you might wanna
bend over for this one.

637
00:53:19,877 --> 00:53:22,404
As you know, Reuben's missing,

638
00:53:22,405 --> 00:53:25,836
and the suspect's a
Hall of Famer in Chino.

639
00:53:25,989 --> 00:53:29,044
Suffice to say, the old man's
probably not coming back.

640
00:53:29,045 --> 00:53:32,901
Which means, I'm promoted,
and you are fucked.

641
00:53:32,902 --> 00:53:36,612
But we already signed
the contract, right?

642
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:40,996
The papers you signed are in Reuben's
briefcase, which never leaves his side.

643
00:53:40,997 --> 00:53:43,044
And since said the briefcase
wasn't recovered,

644
00:53:43,045 --> 00:53:47,045
I'm guessing it's probably in a ditch
somewhere next to his rotting corpse.

645
00:53:47,046 --> 00:53:50,372
Now, I was going over
my roster of bands,

646
00:53:50,373 --> 00:53:53,188
and I just don't think we're gonna
be needing your services anymore.

647
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,748
The tour is off. Go fuck yourselves.

648
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:59,140
- What? You can't do that.
- I can. And I will, Eddie.

649
00:53:59,141 --> 00:54:01,860
But you know what you
can't do? Play guitar.

650
00:54:01,861 --> 00:54:05,760
Does anyone here realize
I write the fucking music?

651
00:54:05,761 --> 00:54:10,628
Chas, you got all the talent in
the world, but you wanna fuck me,

652
00:54:10,629 --> 00:54:12,996
- and that's not gonna happen.
- Blow me.

653
00:54:12,997 --> 00:54:16,618
- Toss, you gonna be dead by 30.
- I'm 34.

654
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:20,676
I know. That leaves the
legendary Gunther Shea.

655
00:54:20,677 --> 00:54:24,100
The only real asset in
the band. What do you say?

656
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:26,123
Thanks?

657
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:31,076
- What are you doing for lunch?
- I drink lunch for breakfast.

658
00:54:31,077 --> 00:54:33,555
That doesn't even make sense.

659
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:35,364
Oh, I almost forgot.

660
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:38,404
Eddie, what's the quickest way from
here to your girlfriend's mouth?

661
00:54:38,405 --> 00:54:41,732
I'm gonna rip that fashion
beard off your face!

662
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:43,844
Okay, okay, it's cool.

663
00:54:45,733 --> 00:54:48,772
Hey, it's cool. I've got
GPS, and I'll find it.

664
00:54:48,773 --> 00:54:53,893
Somebody tell me where the commode is
in this joint? I'm growing a tail over here.

665
00:54:53,894 --> 00:54:57,412
You boys better start singing,
or we'll bring forensics down here,

666
00:54:57,413 --> 00:54:59,972
drug sniffing dog,
we'll come to our own conclusion.

667
00:54:59,973 --> 00:55:02,724
Whoa whoa. Wait, alright.

668
00:55:02,725 --> 00:55:06,884
I'll talk. If I talk, what I say's
gonna be used against me in court?

669
00:55:06,885 --> 00:55:08,708
You don't say anything about
Adler's disappearance,

670
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:09,924
I don't care if you plead the fifth.

671
00:55:09,925 --> 00:55:12,260
I always wanted to do that.
Yeah, I'm gonna plead the fifth.

672
00:55:12,261 --> 00:55:14,405
I'd like to drink to fifth now,
if that's available.

673
00:55:14,406 --> 00:55:16,740
I'd like to drink some water.

674
00:55:16,741 --> 00:55:18,788
Oh, no, thanks.

675
00:55:18,789 --> 00:55:21,555
Give him the water, you punk.

676
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:33,536
Fucking Vodka!

677
00:55:33,541 --> 00:55:36,556
- You motherfuckers!
- Really?

678
00:55:37,157 --> 00:55:38,828
I can't tell.

679
00:55:47,676 --> 00:55:49,508
Where should I start?

680
00:55:49,509 --> 00:55:51,749
Well, we left off with you...

681
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,820
being at a "Gentlemen's Lounge"

682
00:55:54,821 --> 00:55:57,836
with Toss and a female names Layla.

683
00:56:00,645 --> 00:56:02,917
Don't let it die a virgin.

684
00:56:02,918 --> 00:56:06,304
Virgins. Thanks for nothing.

685
00:56:14,660 --> 00:56:16,716
This will smoke itself.

686
00:56:17,605 --> 00:56:20,132
Do you guys, um...

687
00:56:20,133 --> 00:56:22,771
wanna do some Ecstasy?

688
00:56:23,332 --> 00:56:26,157
Don't put a question mark
where I put a period.

689
00:56:39,716 --> 00:56:42,707
How about you?

690
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,349
Don't threat me with a good time.

691
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,517
We need music.

692
00:56:59,364 --> 00:57:03,924
I'm coming too! Okay...

693
00:57:08,901 --> 00:57:11,844
Come on. I've gotten
bigger into smaller.

694
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:14,203
I gotta go around.

695
00:57:20,132 --> 00:57:22,308
One. More. Line.

696
00:57:22,309 --> 00:57:24,356
One. More. Line.

697
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:28,659
One more line.

698
00:57:41,348 --> 00:57:44,012
Yeah, Chas.

699
00:57:47,332 --> 00:57:49,587
Rock star!

700
00:57:57,252 --> 00:57:59,684
I'm just kidding.

701
00:57:59,685 --> 00:58:02,572
I'm just kidding.

702
00:58:06,373 --> 00:58:10,156
- I'm just kidding.
- Just kidding...

703
00:58:15,428 --> 00:58:17,660
David Bowie.

704
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:22,500
Sorry, he got into my panties first,
but, you'll have your chance.

705
00:58:22,501 --> 00:58:25,476
- I couldn't pull these off.
- You couldn't pull these on.

706
00:58:25,477 --> 00:58:28,452
So, where were we?

707
00:58:28,453 --> 00:58:32,100
We were just talking about that rock
star loser who didn't appreciate me.

708
00:58:32,101 --> 00:58:33,924
So you like rock star...

709
00:58:33,925 --> 00:58:37,772
So, you like losers.

710
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:40,956
What about rock star losers?

711
00:58:56,261 --> 00:59:00,783
It's just a little acid, boys. So...

712
00:59:02,308 --> 00:59:03,684
Who wants me first?

713
00:59:03,685 --> 00:59:06,883
Looks like I'm about to fall
off the wagon going 50.

714
00:59:06,884 --> 00:59:09,444
I got dips on the mouth.

715
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,820
Amigo.

716
00:59:31,245 --> 00:59:33,157
Yeah.

717
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:36,388
Feel like I'm jut being
railed like Dumbo.

718
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:38,729
Thank you for leaving those shoes on.

719
00:59:42,885 --> 00:59:45,412
I always thought I'd be saying
this to chas, but Toss,

720
00:59:45,413 --> 00:59:46,788
why don't you come out of the closet?

721
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:50,188
Yeah, why don't you come
over here and hit this?

722
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:01,412
Oh, well, so, where were we?

723
01:00:01,413 --> 01:00:03,652
Oh, that's right.
I know where we were.

724
01:00:03,653 --> 01:00:07,652
You, were just about to blow me.

725
01:00:07,653 --> 01:00:10,820
Ah, yeah, no. It's not gonna happen.

726
01:00:10,821 --> 01:00:12,940
That would be like sucking his dick.

727
01:00:13,285 --> 01:00:16,383
- I blew him and you kissed me.
- Not in that order.

728
01:00:16,836 --> 01:00:19,115
Really?

729
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,687
Okay. Whatever.

730
01:00:24,741 --> 01:00:28,356
That's okay. I haven't
fucked the guitarist...

731
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:30,112
yet.

732
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:36,516
- Where are my notes?
- What?

733
01:00:36,517 --> 01:00:39,172
My notes. They were just here.

734
01:00:39,173 --> 01:00:41,484
I seriously have no idea what
you are talking about, kid.

735
01:00:41,485 --> 01:00:44,140
You took them, didn't you?

736
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:47,164
You alright?

737
01:00:50,917 --> 01:00:54,848
The goal gets weird. Weird term pro.

738
01:01:27,781 --> 01:01:30,924
They're all whores.

739
01:02:19,341 --> 01:02:21,299
What are you doing?

740
01:02:21,763 --> 01:02:25,631
Drinking wine. Playing guitar.

741
01:02:27,588 --> 01:02:32,772
Clearly, trying to hook up
with myself. You look like shit.

742
01:02:32,773 --> 01:02:37,444
- I can't hear you with that shirt on.
- Dude, have you seen Jenny anywhere?

743
01:02:37,445 --> 01:02:41,555
I can't here you with that shirt on.

744
01:02:43,056 --> 01:02:45,059
Help.

745
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:46,292
Okay.

746
01:02:53,668 --> 01:02:57,335
My brain... is like uh...

747
01:02:57,957 --> 01:03:00,371
hot air balloon.

748
01:03:00,548 --> 01:03:03,236
Cover in a sexless marriage.

749
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:07,716
So, is that why I'm dressed like
a dick head right now? Huh?

750
01:03:10,341 --> 01:03:12,908
Funny. Yeah.

751
01:03:13,477 --> 01:03:16,516
Look, why don't you just pull the trigger
and get the rest of that out, alright?

752
01:03:16,517 --> 01:03:20,184
No. The coke's outweighing the booze.

753
01:03:20,773 --> 01:03:23,140
I know Beth had you all fucked
up in the head, man.

754
01:03:23,141 --> 01:03:26,916
- But look, you just got...
- I'm all fucked up because the LSD...

755
01:03:26,917 --> 01:03:29,663
is stronger than the Ecstasy.

756
01:03:31,173 --> 01:03:35,123
I'm tripping. Balls, man!

757
01:03:37,124 --> 01:03:40,735
I've seen music in here.
And colors, man.

758
01:03:50,180 --> 01:03:52,267
Jenny?

759
01:03:52,868 --> 01:03:54,020
This is not what it looks like.

760
01:03:54,021 --> 01:03:56,484
- We were just talking, I swear.
- See, there.

761
01:03:56,485 --> 01:03:58,244
You can tell she's lying
because she's a woman.

762
01:03:58,245 --> 01:04:01,028
- And her lips are moving.
- Shut it, Spencer.

763
01:04:01,029 --> 01:04:03,556
- One more word from you and I'm...
- How's my dick taste, Eddie?

764
01:04:03,557 --> 01:04:06,563
- Oh, you touch...
- Think about it, kiddo...

765
01:04:06,564 --> 01:04:11,783
You hit him, he wins.
No contract, no tour.

766
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:20,484
You know what? You two
deserve each other.

767
01:04:20,485 --> 01:04:24,307
Don't say that, please.

768
01:04:24,803 --> 01:04:27,032
It's gonna be fine, buddy.

769
01:04:27,433 --> 01:04:30,307
- I just miss her so much.
- Hey Gunther.

770
01:04:30,308 --> 01:04:35,763
That sound advice coming from a guy who's
almost made it, what, like six times now?

771
01:04:36,645 --> 01:04:38,360
He's mine.

772
01:05:08,068 --> 01:05:11,623
You want some creep tonight? Bitch.

773
01:05:19,524 --> 01:05:22,035
I thought they'd never leave.

774
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:27,755
Slut.

775
01:05:42,692 --> 01:05:45,539
Hey, this is Jenny. Sorry I
missed your call, leave me...

776
01:05:45,540 --> 01:05:47,523
It's all I got.

777
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:51,928
Tell me... you got... the contract.

778
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:58,820
I did, but...

779
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:01,219
We want answers and we want them now.

780
01:06:01,220 --> 01:06:05,380
Where is our copy of the contract?

781
01:06:05,381 --> 01:06:07,244
I'm gonna shoot that damn thing.

782
01:06:13,731 --> 01:06:16,675
- What, uh, no, no, no...
- Shhh...

783
01:06:16,676 --> 01:06:18,444
What?

784
01:06:18,445 --> 01:06:20,707
Hello, Officers.

785
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:23,364
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

786
01:06:23,365 --> 01:06:26,819
But I stopped by to help the
boys clean up. Is, that all right?

787
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,988
- But you need to...
- Give me more, give me more...

788
01:06:39,652 --> 01:06:43,024
- What the fuck was that?
- Well, here we go.

789
01:06:43,525 --> 01:06:46,212
Pretty sure that girl just found
Reuben's dead body in our pool.

790
01:06:46,213 --> 01:06:48,324
- You're shitting me?
- Mom was right.

791
01:06:48,325 --> 01:06:50,115
My first record will be criminal.

792
01:06:50,116 --> 01:06:54,139
Where the fuck is our
copy of the contract?

793
01:06:55,044 --> 01:06:58,051
Stall the cops. I know
what I have to do.

794
01:06:58,052 --> 01:06:59,844
You guys are on your own.
I quit. Remember?

795
01:06:59,845 --> 01:07:02,276
Good thing I'm not talking to you...

796
01:07:02,277 --> 01:07:05,604
Guys, stall the freaking cops.
Superman's on it.

797
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:09,123
Have you see my trunk?
I'm gonna save this freaking band.

798
01:07:09,124 --> 01:07:14,470
We got a corpse in the pool. Which means
this is now a crime scene. Nobody leaves.

799
01:07:24,067 --> 01:07:28,691
- You know the protocol, rookie.
- Come the fuck on. He's dead.

800
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:36,547
Watch commander this is car W-2K.
Investigating a 10-54.

801
01:07:36,548 --> 01:07:40,451
Requesting paramedics
at 90201 Hagen Road.

802
01:07:40,452 --> 01:07:43,460
- 10-23 car W-2K.
- 10-4.

803
01:07:43,461 --> 01:07:46,276
- Anything?
- Tell them to send the Coroner.

804
01:07:46,277 --> 01:07:48,427
I gonna die if I have to make
out with this corpse any longer.

805
01:07:48,428 --> 01:07:50,643
Paramedics are en route.
Do you need further assistance?

806
01:07:50,644 --> 01:07:53,764
- Yeah. You'd better send the Coroner.
- How about some backup?

807
01:07:53,765 --> 01:07:56,810
How about you do your
job and let do me do mine?

808
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:05,796
This dead body ringing
any bells for you boys?

809
01:08:05,797 --> 01:08:10,276
Not yet. Amigo. Toss me one of those.

810
01:08:10,277 --> 01:08:13,283
- This is a fucking clown show.
- Hey guys, I don't think so.

811
01:08:13,284 --> 01:08:15,907
We gonna take statements form you later,
you can't do it if you are drunk.

812
01:08:15,908 --> 01:08:19,579
This maybe the last beer I have
before I lose my anal virginity.

813
01:08:21,604 --> 01:08:23,764
Hey, put the beer down.

814
01:08:24,165 --> 01:08:26,500
Never take me alive.

815
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:31,204
Kazansky, go get him. I'll take it
from here. Hey get the old guy, too.

816
01:08:31,205 --> 01:08:32,643
Let me know if you gotta take a shit,

817
01:08:32,644 --> 01:08:35,852
we wouldn't want you wiping
your own ass. You old prick.

818
01:08:42,628 --> 01:08:45,455
Looks like we're
going to jail, Eddie.

819
01:08:45,540 --> 01:08:48,547
You know, I was up all
night thinking...

820
01:08:48,548 --> 01:08:52,580
Thinking? Is that what the kids call a
good old fashioned coke bender these days?

821
01:08:52,581 --> 01:08:55,652
Take it easy, baby dick.
I know I messed up.

822
01:08:55,653 --> 01:08:59,363
And then I went over to Jenny's
last night, and I tried to fix things.

823
01:08:59,364 --> 01:09:00,863
And?

824
01:09:00,864 --> 01:09:04,982
I mean I tried to reason
with her, but... she's a girl. So...

825
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,635
Let's just say...

826
01:09:09,636 --> 01:09:13,299
I don't think she's
coming back, mate.

827
01:09:34,404 --> 01:09:39,585
Well, well. Looks like you manage to do in
one night what I wanted to do for years.

828
01:09:39,588 --> 01:09:41,380
You murdered my boss.

829
01:09:41,381 --> 01:09:45,091
- Eat my dick, Spencer.
- Not if it cured cancer. Chas.

830
01:09:45,092 --> 01:09:47,140
You're gay, and your ass sticks.

831
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,955
Mr. Bayne, would you mind
identifying the body for us?

832
01:09:49,956 --> 01:09:53,764
Abso-fucking-lutely not. I was too
much of that prick when he was alive.

833
01:09:53,765 --> 01:09:57,252
That's fine. Next of kin has been alerted.
I'm sure they'd be glad to do it.

834
01:09:57,253 --> 01:10:01,298
Great. I'll be over here, chillaxing.

835
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:06,355
Want a front row seat
for this. Let's go, baby.

836
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,931
You boys are in a heap of trouble.

837
01:10:08,932 --> 01:10:11,779
Wait, hey! It's okay.
I remember last night.

838
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:14,403
Crackpot, crackpot.
Remember! Everything...

839
01:10:14,404 --> 01:10:18,098
Right on. Okay! Hm...

840
01:10:20,964 --> 01:10:24,871
Touchdown... ladies and gentlemen.

841
01:10:25,572 --> 01:10:27,556
I don't feel good.

842
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:34,098
So, this is how you niggas
do it up in the hills, huh?

843
01:10:35,107 --> 01:10:37,851
Samuel L. Jackson.

844
01:10:39,907 --> 01:10:43,043
Oh, my... goodness!

845
01:10:43,044 --> 01:10:46,283
Filipino James.
Theses are my darlings.

846
01:10:46,284 --> 01:10:49,867
- Darlings, say hello to, uh...
- Jenny.

847
01:10:50,979 --> 01:10:55,043
- Bitch, you wanna die tonight?
- I was uh, just leaving.

848
01:10:55,044 --> 01:10:58,275
You look upset, baby girl.
Wanna talk to daddy about it?

849
01:10:58,276 --> 01:11:01,763
I don't know you but I know what
you're doing. And it is not gonna work.

850
01:11:01,764 --> 01:11:05,060
Woo! Sharp tongue.
I like that in a bitch.

851
01:11:05,061 --> 01:11:07,402
Excuse me.

852
01:11:14,852 --> 01:11:17,091
Look, we looking for Chas.
We the entertainment.

853
01:11:17,092 --> 01:11:19,418
That's typical.

854
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:25,452
Find that nigga Chas and give him
everything that he has coming to him.

855
01:11:25,453 --> 01:11:27,043
Nothing more. You hear me?

856
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:33,491
Now, who's this whore gotta blow
to get me a drink up in this bitch?

857
01:11:40,311 --> 01:11:42,354
Is that your briefcase?

858
01:11:42,948 --> 01:11:46,898
Alright, I think we got
some code 45...

859
01:11:47,748 --> 01:11:49,603
It's a...

860
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:51,844
Nice place you guys got here.

861
01:11:51,845 --> 01:11:54,628
Yeah, we like it, we like it.

862
01:11:54,629 --> 01:11:57,604
- You rent?
- Yep, yep, we rent.

863
01:11:57,605 --> 01:12:00,675
It's the worst house on the
block, but we're on the block.

864
01:12:06,156 --> 01:12:08,291
Do you have any crack?

865
01:12:08,292 --> 01:12:10,531
Jenny?

866
01:12:10,532 --> 01:12:13,427
- You see her anywhere, man?
- What? No, she left. I don't know.

867
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:15,844
I don't know right now.
Give me that. Give me that.

868
01:12:15,845 --> 01:12:17,123
Bitch did not look happy.

869
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:21,123
Look, you gotta beat that shit out of her
before it becomes a fucking problem.

870
01:12:21,124 --> 01:12:22,371
Fuck me.

871
01:12:22,372 --> 01:12:24,996
- You a friend of Chas?
- Not anymore.

872
01:12:24,997 --> 01:12:28,771
Damn. That coulda been arranged.
One of my bitches.

873
01:12:28,772 --> 01:12:32,939
Honest, hard-working people
are trying to do coke.

874
01:12:33,540 --> 01:12:35,779
What the fuck is going on here?

875
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,987
There's a pimp and
some entrepreneurs.

876
01:12:37,988 --> 01:12:40,875
- And crack.
- And crack.

877
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:44,188
You boys ready to rock?

878
01:13:13,444 --> 01:13:14,403
Get it off me!

879
01:13:14,404 --> 01:13:17,746
Easy, playa.

880
01:13:23,748 --> 01:13:25,027
What? You're better than me?

881
01:13:25,028 --> 01:13:27,491
Fool! She's deaf!

882
01:13:27,492 --> 01:13:30,738
This chick's got a listening problem.

883
01:13:31,363 --> 01:13:33,867
I'm stuck, you dick!

884
01:13:35,716 --> 01:13:37,507
Time's up.

885
01:13:37,508 --> 01:13:42,363
Lollipops, you off the clock
so get up off the cock.

886
01:13:43,364 --> 01:13:45,458
What about me?

887
01:13:48,388 --> 01:13:51,018
I love your accent.

888
01:14:17,155 --> 01:14:21,035
Damn... That's gonna cost extra.

889
01:14:21,796 --> 01:14:24,387
Hey, you got any crack?

890
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:26,811
Nigga... I'ma crack you.

891
01:14:28,196 --> 01:14:30,770
How much money you got?

892
01:14:35,139 --> 01:14:38,174
Oh, come on. Dude.

893
01:14:53,379 --> 01:14:58,435
I wasn't finished. I know,
I think I left a ring inside of her.

894
01:14:58,436 --> 01:15:00,419
Yo cards are all maxed, fool.

895
01:15:00,420 --> 01:15:03,211
So unless you got cash,
you're finished.

896
01:15:03,212 --> 01:15:06,947
Look, we got one, two,
three, four hos in here.

897
01:15:06,948 --> 01:15:11,407
We've been here an hour.
That's a grand easy.

898
01:15:13,316 --> 01:15:15,555
Grand.

899
01:15:15,556 --> 01:15:17,347
I don't have that kinda money.

900
01:15:17,348 --> 01:15:23,075
Nigga, you best give me my money.
Or someone has to get, physical.

901
01:15:23,076 --> 01:15:25,879
No James. He's out best customer.

902
01:15:27,652 --> 01:15:30,819
We ain't here pro-boner bitch!
You finger fuck yourself,

903
01:15:30,820 --> 01:15:36,331
I'd better get 55 dollars
and 39 cents. You understand?

904
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,723
You shouldn't have done that.

905
01:15:38,724 --> 01:15:42,403
Look, I go take a shit,
I call that bitch.

906
01:15:42,404 --> 01:15:44,822
What you gonna do about it, hippie?

907
01:15:49,443 --> 01:15:51,171
Run!

908
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:53,091
Do her.

909
01:15:53,092 --> 01:15:55,434
Save her.

910
01:15:57,443 --> 01:15:59,842
I'm gonna regulate.

911
01:16:02,627 --> 01:16:04,747
Gun!

912
01:16:30,399 --> 01:16:33,190
Hands to heaven, motherfucker.

913
01:16:40,604 --> 01:16:43,467
You don't even know
how to use that, bitch.

914
01:16:43,524 --> 01:16:46,403
Okay, okay, hey hey hey...

915
01:16:46,404 --> 01:16:49,987
How about... I cut you both
a little discount. Huh?

916
01:16:49,988 --> 01:16:52,779
Say five hundred.

917
01:16:55,524 --> 01:16:58,042
Way to kill Bambi.

918
01:17:15,299 --> 01:17:18,474
Hello there. Are you okay?

919
01:17:24,459 --> 01:17:28,227
My fiance would kill me if we're
doing this, but hi. I'm Layla.

920
01:17:28,228 --> 01:17:32,003
If I wanted any lip service from you,
I'd let down my zipper.

921
01:17:32,004 --> 01:17:33,666
Oh, okay.

922
01:17:44,068 --> 01:17:46,947
Please, please! Just one rock.
I gotta have that crack.

923
01:17:46,948 --> 01:17:51,971
Give it to me, Come on, brother man.
I'm sorry I was gonna shot you.

924
01:17:51,972 --> 01:17:55,114
I was just fuc... No, no...

925
01:18:05,412 --> 01:18:07,538
Wait a second,

926
01:18:08,547 --> 01:18:12,599
you're telling me,
Chas really is half a gay?

927
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:16,803
You know I may have a small
cocaine and hooker problem.

928
01:18:16,804 --> 01:18:19,746
And apparently you like getting
pumped more than a pair of Reeboks.

929
01:18:19,747 --> 01:18:22,882
No. Apparently "Jagermeister" is
German for "makes me kiss boy".

930
01:18:22,883 --> 01:18:27,907
Enough. Where's the girl Reuben left with?
Layla? Anybody have her number?

931
01:18:27,908 --> 01:18:30,147
I'll suck your dick.
Just give me the crack.

932
01:18:30,148 --> 01:18:34,386
- I don't get digits, I give them.
- Last night must be an exception.

933
01:18:35,747 --> 01:18:38,446
Hey boys, take it easy. Take it easy!

934
01:18:40,003 --> 01:18:43,427
All right. Everybody calm down.
Right now, you hear me?

935
01:18:43,428 --> 01:18:47,351
- Okay, okay.
- I say calm down, you hear me?

936
01:19:01,603 --> 01:19:04,466
I regret nothing!

937
01:19:13,124 --> 01:19:15,299
Son of a bitch!

938
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,435
- Lookit, lookit what I found.
- You found the briefcase.

939
01:19:18,436 --> 01:19:22,595
- What the shit do you care?
- You should care. It's Hermes.

940
01:19:22,596 --> 01:19:27,899
Oh, what kinda party are you
all having, why wasn't I invited?

941
01:19:28,900 --> 01:19:33,027
I'll take that. This is company property
if I'm not mistaken, right Officers?

942
01:19:33,028 --> 01:19:37,123
A long as it doesn't have any
evidence pertaining to the body.

943
01:19:37,124 --> 01:19:39,715
- At least I get one phone call.
- I just hope she answers.

944
01:19:39,716 --> 01:19:42,499
I'm far too fucking pretty for jail.

945
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:45,746
How am I suppose to
get drugs in the clink?

946
01:19:46,723 --> 01:19:49,986
I just wanna to rock one
stadium with you guys. Once.

947
01:19:49,987 --> 01:19:52,579
You guys will shit yourselves.
And your pants.

948
01:19:52,580 --> 01:19:54,595
So every time I ever
get shot a big time...

949
01:19:54,596 --> 01:19:57,470
You shit yourself, Gunther.

950
01:19:58,244 --> 01:20:01,743
That douche bag is right.
Right now, I'm a fucking loser,

951
01:20:01,744 --> 01:20:07,142
- Eddie quit the band, Toss needs rehab.
- I don't need rehab. Rehab needs me.

952
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:11,043
Chas is Chas.

953
01:20:11,044 --> 01:20:14,146
I'm so over the hill, when I look back,
it's like I'm sliding out a mountain,

954
01:20:14,147 --> 01:20:18,403
but I do know this... we play nice.

955
01:20:18,404 --> 01:20:21,327
Even though we have
no idea how to play nice.

956
01:20:21,728 --> 01:20:23,682
Eddie,

957
01:20:23,683 --> 01:20:27,522
out of my six shots at rock stardom,

958
01:20:27,523 --> 01:20:31,587
this is the only time, one time,
I thought I had a legitimate chance.

959
01:20:31,588 --> 01:20:34,563
That's because you write the music.

960
01:20:34,564 --> 01:20:36,721
I mean it.

961
01:20:38,082 --> 01:20:43,107
Well, I'd rather go to jail than
go on tour with you selfish pricks.

962
01:20:43,108 --> 01:20:47,690
Fine. You wanna quit the band? Quit
the band, kiddo. Bands come and go...

963
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:50,562
but this was more than a band.

964
01:20:50,563 --> 01:20:53,672
And these pricks,
as selfish as they are...

965
01:20:53,673 --> 01:20:58,289
never quit on you. So who's in?

966
01:20:59,907 --> 01:21:01,866
Amigo!

967
01:21:09,987 --> 01:21:12,002
All we need,

968
01:21:12,003 --> 01:21:16,642
is somebody to write us
couple of really great songs.

969
01:21:16,643 --> 01:21:18,522
Come one.

970
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:21,155
Come on!

971
01:21:21,156 --> 01:21:26,427
It's definitely dysfunctional.
But it's family.

972
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:30,434
- I love you guys!
- Yeah!

973
01:21:30,435 --> 01:21:33,707
There you go. Come on!

974
01:21:34,883 --> 01:21:37,706
Stay away from the pretty one,
I think it's contagious.

975
01:21:38,211 --> 01:21:40,099
David Bowie!

976
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,731
Yeah!

977
01:21:41,732 --> 01:21:44,195
Oh, my god. No!

978
01:21:44,196 --> 01:21:46,994
- Hello boys.
- Jenny?

979
01:21:47,907 --> 01:21:50,134
- What are you doing here?
- Here to help.

980
01:21:50,135 --> 01:21:53,474
I had my whole life ahead of me.

981
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:56,035
Look who strolled into
the office a hour ago.

982
01:22:01,858 --> 01:22:05,315
Reports of my death have
been greatly exaggerated.

983
01:22:05,316 --> 01:22:08,930
I can't live without you.
I can't pay rent.

984
01:22:08,931 --> 01:22:13,090
You thought that guy was me?
I'm way better looking than that.

985
01:22:13,091 --> 01:22:15,855
Wait, are you Reuben Adler?

986
01:22:16,356 --> 01:22:19,394
- In the flesh.
- Then who the fuck is that?

987
01:22:19,395 --> 01:22:24,689
Why god? Why Geoffrey?

988
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:28,163
I better be in that will,
you motherfucker.

989
01:22:28,164 --> 01:22:31,715
No call, no email, no text.

990
01:22:31,716 --> 01:22:33,923
Man, boss, we've been
worried sick about you.

991
01:22:33,924 --> 01:22:38,915
I'm sure. Is that why you tried
to exercise power of attorney?

992
01:22:38,916 --> 01:22:42,015
Yeah, I was trying to
protect your interest.

993
01:22:42,016 --> 01:22:44,610
Yeah. We're gonna need
a statement from Chuck.

994
01:22:44,611 --> 01:22:47,298
We're gonna need a statement
from you as well, Mr. Adler.

995
01:22:47,299 --> 01:22:50,435
- We were carjacked.
- It was awesome.

996
01:22:50,436 --> 01:22:53,987
It made us realized how
short life could be. So...

997
01:22:53,988 --> 01:22:58,947
I chartered a plane to Vegas. Guys,
meet the fifth Mrs. Reuben Adler!

998
01:22:58,948 --> 01:23:01,155
Come here, baby.

999
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:11,011
While I'm alive, why is my
favorite band still in handcuffs?

1000
01:23:11,012 --> 01:23:14,626
There still is a matter of the
dead body we found in the pool.

1001
01:23:14,627 --> 01:23:18,795
The only offense they're guilty is,
throwing the greatest party ever.

1002
01:23:20,291 --> 01:23:21,923
Take them off.

1003
01:23:21,924 --> 01:23:23,794
Reuben...

1004
01:23:24,418 --> 01:23:27,242
the company could
face a major lawsuit.

1005
01:23:27,299 --> 01:23:29,763
Maybe we should consider
cutting our losses here?

1006
01:23:29,764 --> 01:23:32,770
Are you shitting me?
You can't buy press like this.

1007
01:23:32,771 --> 01:23:35,021
We'll go platinum in a week. Days!

1008
01:23:35,023 --> 01:23:38,434
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Are you sure they
are not more trouble then they're worth?

1009
01:23:38,435 --> 01:23:42,943
Spencer, you have a
horrible fucking taste.

1010
01:23:44,387 --> 01:23:47,650
Is that my Hermes briefcase?

1011
01:23:52,258 --> 01:23:55,714
Why is their contract covered in...

1012
01:23:55,715 --> 01:23:56,418
piss?

1013
01:23:56,419 --> 01:23:59,011
- Look, this is, is...
- I don't want excuses.

1014
01:23:59,012 --> 01:24:00,675
I want that contract re-drawn,

1015
01:24:00,676 --> 01:24:03,778
and I want these guys in front of
fifty thousand people tomorrow night.

1016
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:05,346
Yes!

1017
01:24:05,347 --> 01:24:10,578
- But, but, but Reuben...
- But what?

1018
01:24:11,106 --> 01:24:16,721
Listen, okay? Just think
this one through. Please!

1019
01:24:18,251 --> 01:24:20,370
Fine.

1020
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:22,643
You're fired.

1021
01:24:27,682 --> 01:24:29,649
Bullshit!

1022
01:24:30,147 --> 01:24:31,874
You wouldn't know how
to wake up without me.

1023
01:24:31,875 --> 01:24:33,858
You know, that sounds a little gay.

1024
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:37,059
Have your office cleaned out by the
time I stroll in around noon tomorrow.

1025
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:41,155
Oh, man. You gonna fucking regret this,
old man. That is a promise!

1026
01:24:41,156 --> 01:24:44,035
Officer, I'd like a restraining
order against this guy.

1027
01:24:44,036 --> 01:24:47,075
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Jesus.

1028
01:24:47,076 --> 01:24:50,434
Mr. Adler, hi, um...

1029
01:24:50,435 --> 01:24:52,434
Can I hit him?

1030
01:24:52,451 --> 01:24:54,851
I don't know.

1031
01:24:54,852 --> 01:24:56,203
Can you?

1032
01:25:03,747 --> 01:25:05,507
Yeah!

1033
01:25:05,508 --> 01:25:08,762
- Nice shot!
- Huh?

1034
01:25:08,963 --> 01:25:13,506
Chuck he says this man in the
pool, is his um, lover, Geoffrey.

1035
01:25:13,507 --> 01:25:18,499
We got into a fight. He must have
gone on one of his bender and...

1036
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:21,762
There, there, Chucky. I know
how hard this must be for you.

1037
01:25:21,763 --> 01:25:27,183
Why don't you do sit down.
Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead.

1038
01:25:27,684 --> 01:25:31,819
Apparently, the deceased was in and
out of Betty Ford more than, Gerald Ford.

1039
01:25:31,820 --> 01:25:34,403
You maybe the luckiest
sons of bitches alive.

1040
01:25:34,404 --> 01:25:37,122
But we are all going
downtown for questioning.

1041
01:25:37,123 --> 01:25:40,074
I'll let you out quicker
than Lindsay Lohan.

1042
01:25:40,154 --> 01:25:42,413
Don't worry, boys.

1043
01:25:47,938 --> 01:25:49,411
Thank you.

1044
01:25:49,412 --> 01:25:53,026
You... kinda save the day.

1045
01:25:53,027 --> 01:25:56,494
- Thank Chas, actually.
- What?

1046
01:26:01,026 --> 01:26:03,011
Rhythm guitar, Eddie.

1047
01:26:03,012 --> 01:26:06,205
You are only rhythm guitar.

1048
01:26:09,890 --> 01:26:13,923
We do have the worst timing.

1049
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:16,625
We both wanna lead.

1050
01:26:17,346 --> 01:26:19,650
And you know that I
wouldn't make uh...

1051
01:26:19,651 --> 01:26:23,985
- that mistake twice, right?
- I know.

1052
01:26:24,323 --> 01:26:28,706
I'm sorry, Jenny.
I'm sorry for all that.

1053
01:26:29,307 --> 01:26:30,914
Me too.

1054
01:26:30,915 --> 01:26:34,930
So... what now?

1055
01:26:37,475 --> 01:26:40,547
Go on tour. And um...

1056
01:26:40,548 --> 01:26:43,570
I'll be here when you're back.

1057
01:26:43,971 --> 01:26:49,570
One of those... if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be type of deals, huh?

1058
01:26:49,571 --> 01:26:52,753
Yeah, I guess so.

1059
01:26:55,395 --> 01:26:57,890
This is all so very...

1060
01:26:57,891 --> 01:26:59,818
Rock and Roll.

1061
01:27:40,611 --> 01:27:43,882
All right. That's enough.

1062
01:27:52,387 --> 01:27:56,714
Well... now it's time
for the real party.

1062
01:27:57,305 --> 01:28:57,703
