1
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,200
Come, come!

2
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,800
Please!

3
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,800
Aziz. Aziz.

4
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,100
Aziz, light!

5
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,700
Aziz...

6
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,800
light.

7
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:26,800
Good.

8
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,700
We start again.

9
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
"When the three planets
are in eclipse...

10
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,700
the black hole,
like a door, is open.

11
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,700
Evil comes...

12
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,200
spreading terror and chaos."

13
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,900
See the snake, Billy?
The ultimate evil.

14
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,900
- Make sure you get the snake.
- Yes, I've got your snakes.

15
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,600
I got all the snakes.

16
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,000
When is the snake act
supposed to occur?

17
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,500
If this is the five...

18
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,900
and this is the one...

19
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,400
every 5,000 years.

20
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,100
So, I've got some time then.

21
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,100
You bring them water.

22
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,100
Good boy.
I'll take it to them.

23
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
Go with God.
Be safe from evil.

24
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,500
You see here these different peoples,
or symbols of people...

25
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,700
gathering the four elements
of life...

26
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,800
water, fire, earth, air...

27
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,800
around a fifth one.

28
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,300
A fifth...

29
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,500
element.

30
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,700
Forgive me, Lord.

31
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
They already know
too much.

32
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Father.

33
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,200
How are you?

34
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,400
- Well. You have some glasses?
- Of course.

35
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm so glad to see you.
It's the most extraordinary thing.

36
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,000
It's the greatest find
in history.

37
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,500
You must be parched.

38
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,500
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,000
It's like a battle plan.

40
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,800
Here the good.

41
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,200
Here the evil.

42
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,600
And here, a weapon...

43
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,900
against evil.

44
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm going
to be famous.

45
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:25,800
Then let us toast
to your fame.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,300
To fame.

47
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,200
Salute.

48
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,000
You can't toast
with water.

49
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,400
Billy, in my sack,
the grappa.

50
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,900
This I don't understand.

51
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,600
This could be something...

52
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,800
prehistoric.

53
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,400
I don't know.

54
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,400
But, wait.

55
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,100
Here.

56
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,400
Look, look.

57
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,900
They're here.

58
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,100
This man...

59
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,700
this perfect being.

60
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,400
I know this is the key.
I know it.

61
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,800
This divine light
they talk about.

62
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,900
What is divine light?

63
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,600
Aziz, light!

64
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,600
Much better.
Thank you.

65
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,700
My Lord.

66
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Father, this is the most
unbelievable thing I've ever seen.

67
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,400
Don't you think?

68
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,200
Are you German?

69
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,400
Lord...

70
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,500
I know he was about
to discover everything.

71
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,800
But, no worry.

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
I was there in time.

73
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,300
Priest...

74
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,100
you and those before you...

75
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,200
have served us well.

76
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,600
But war is coming.

77
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,900
Stones not safe
on Earth anymore.

78
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,700
This...

79
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,900
is really amazing.

80
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,100
The fifth element.

81
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Take the stones.

82
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,800
My Lord...

83
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,200
if you take the weapon,
we'll be defenseless...

84
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,700
when evil returns.

85
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,000
In 300 years...

86
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,400
when evil returns...

87
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
so shall we.

88
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,000
Oh, Professor.

89
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,700
Professor.

90
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,700
Don't move!

91
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,900
I have a gun!

92
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:43,500
Please, understand.
They're our friends.

93
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Friends?

94
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,500
Father, they've killed the Professor!
They're monsters!

95
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,200
I'll explain everything.

96
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,900
- You're with them?
- Look at me.

97
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,300
I am your friend.

98
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,900
- No, Father.
- Billy, look at me!

99
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,800
Please, put...

100
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,100
the gun down.

101
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,400
Billy, no!

102
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
Hurry!

103
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,300
The wall is closing!

104
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,300
Here is your mission:

105
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,600
Pass your knowledge
to the next priest...

106
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,400
as it was passed to you.

107
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,300
I will do as
you command, but...

108
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,300
hurry, you still
have time.

109
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,200
Time not important.

110
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,900
Only life...

111
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,100
important.

112
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,200
I will fulfill
my mission!

113
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,900
You can count on me!

114
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,600
I will pass the knowledge
until your return.

115
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,900
Anything yet?

116
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,300
- Not even a temperature?
- The analyzers have jammed.

117
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,000
One shows a million degrees,
the others minus 5,000.

118
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,200
Let's see it.

119
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,500
It's taking shape.

120
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,700
Send out a probe.

121
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,700
Ladies and gentlemen...

122
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:15,000
the President of
the Federated Territories.

123
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,500
On air with General Staedert
in 30 seconds.

124
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,700
I saved this seat
for you, Father.

125
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
President on the line.

126
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,500
We're in position.

127
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,700
I have to address the Supreme Council.
Just the facts.

128
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,400
There are no results from the chemical
and molecular analysis yet.

129
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,300
All the calibers are overshot.

130
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,200
We're initiating
thermonucleatic imaging.

131
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,100
What you're saying is,
you don't know what this is.

132
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
All we know is,
it just keeps getting bigger.

133
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Recommendation?

134
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,100
My philosophy is
shoot first and ask questions later.

135
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,700
I don't like uninvited guests.

136
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,000
All right, then.

137
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Mr. President?

138
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,400
Priest Vito Cornelius,
expert of astrophenomenon.

139
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,400
I...

140
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,300
have a different theory
to offer you, sir.

141
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,200
You have 20 seconds.

142
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,400
Imagine that this...

143
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,700
thing is not anything
that can be identified...

144
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,100
because it prefers not to be.

145
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,900
Wherever there is life...

146
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,100
it brings death...

147
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,100
because it's evil.

148
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,200
Absolute evil.

149
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,900
One more reason
to shoot first.

150
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,800
Evil begets evil, Mr. President.

151
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Shooting will only
make it stronger.

152
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,000
Probe will obtain objective
in five seconds.

153
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,400
Growth rate is at 27%.

154
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,500
Your theory is interesting,
but we don't have time to go into it.

155
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,100
Time is of no importance.
Only life is important.

156
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,800
You're right.
That's exactly what we'll do.

157
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,000
We'll protect the life of 200 billion
of my fellow citizens.

158
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,800
You may fire when ready.

159
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:11,100
Up-front loading of a 120-ZR missile.
Marker lights on the objective.

160
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,000
Its structure solidified
on the surface.

161
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,800
I think it's anticipating the attack.
That denotes intelligence.

162
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,300
The most...

163
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,100
terrible intelligence imaginable.

164
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,300
120's loaded.

165
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,100
The ship is
in combat formation.

166
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,200
Missiles are loaded.

167
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,500
- Staedert.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,200
I have a doubt.

169
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,300
I don't, Mr. President.

170
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,200
What happened?
Can you hear me?

171
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,100
What happened?

172
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,900
- Did you destroy it?
- I'm about to.

173
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,500
The planet has increased
diameter by 200%.

174
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,100
It's moving toward the ship.

175
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:17,700
What do we have
that's bigger than 240?

176
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,200
Nothing, sir.

177
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,200
Staedert, do you hear me?

178
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,800
Get out of there.

179
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,200
I don't want an incident.
Do you hear me?

180
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,600
Get out of there.
Can you hear me, Staedert?

181
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Do you understand?
Listen.

182
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,500
That's an order.

183
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,800
Do you understand me?
Do you hear me?

184
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,000
Get out of there!

185
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,000
Good God!

186
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,000
Four a day.

187
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm tryin'.

188
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,600
To quit is my goal.

189
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,700
I'm up.

190
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,800
All right, I'm up.

191
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,200
God.

192
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,300
Hey, dog brain,
Finger here.

193
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,300
Hi, sweetie.

194
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,700
I love you too.

195
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,400
You haven't called me that
since basic training.

196
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,600
I was talking
to the cat.

197
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,300
I forgot...

198
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,900
you prefer your cat
to the real thing.

199
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,600
At least the cat
comes back.

200
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,900
Still pining
for that two-timing slut?

201
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,400
There's millions
out there.

202
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,200
I don't want
a million.

203
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,300
I just want one.

204
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,400
The perfect one.

205
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,300
It don't exist, Major.

206
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,300
Yeah, I know.

207
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
What?

208
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,300
Picture of you.

209
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,900
- How do I look?
- Like shit.

210
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,500
Must be an old picture.

211
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,900
Bring me your hack
for a six-month overhaul.

212
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,300
- Negative.
- A.S.A.P.

213
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:22,700
I don't need one.

214
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Who sat next to you for 1,000 missions?
I know how you drive.

215
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,800
Finger, I drive
a cab now...

216
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
not a space fighter.

217
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,500
Tell me. How many points
you got left on your license?

218
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,900
Major, how many points?

219
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,500
At least 50.

220
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,100
Know what?
You gotta learn to lie better.

221
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,500
See you tonight.

222
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,700
Welcome to Paradise.

223
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,600
Welcome to Fhloston Paradise.

224
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,600
It's Ruby Rhod,
and I'll tell you live at five...

225
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,000
the winner of the super green
Gemini Croquette Contest!

226
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,500
The winner will go with me
for two days to Fhloston Paradise.

227
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,300
Tune in to Radio Cosmos.

228
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,600
Don't watch all day.
It'll rot your brain.

229
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,100
For a perfect world.

230
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,100
- Give me the cash.
- Been here long?

231
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,700
Long enough.
Give me the cash.

232
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,600
Is that a Z-140?

233
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,000
Alleviated titanium.

234
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,600
Neurocharged assault model.

235
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,800
Good thing for me
it's not loaded.

236
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,200
It's not loaded?

237
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,900
You have to...

238
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,000
push that yellow button
to load it.

239
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,400
Take your time.

240
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,700
Want me to--

241
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,400
There you go.

242
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Give me the cash!

243
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,500
That's a very
dangerous gun.

244
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,900
Maybe you better let me
hang on to this one for you.

245
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,800
You don't mind, do you?
You sure?

246
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,100
No. Take it.
I don't need it.

247
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,000
That's a nice hat.

248
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,500
You like it?

249
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,400
God!

250
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,300
Please enter your license.

251
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,500
Yes, just a minute.

252
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,400
Welcome, Mr. Dallas.

253
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,800
Good morning.

254
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,500
Sleep well? Me too.

255
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,500
I had a horrible nightmare.

256
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Propulsion 2-X-4.

257
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,700
You have five points left
on your license.

258
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,400
Yeah, thank you
for reminding me.

259
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,600
Have a nice day.

260
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,000
Why not?

261
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,900
You have 48 hours.

262
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
That's the time it needs to adapt
itself to our living conditions.

263
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,200
- And then?
- Then it will be too late.

264
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,800
The goal of this thing is not
to fight over money or power...

265
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,400
but to exterminate life.

266
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
All forms of life.

267
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
You're telling me
there's nothing that can stop this.

268
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,700
There is only one thing.

269
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:33,200
The Mondoshawan have in their
possession the weapon to defeat evil.

270
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,400
Four elements...

271
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
gathered around a fifth...

272
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,900
supreme being,
the ultimate warrior...

273
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,900
created to protect life.

274
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,200
Together they produce
"The Light of Creation."

275
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,500
Able to bring life to the farthest
reaches of the universe.

276
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,200
But, if...

277
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,500
evil stands there...

278
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,300
Then what?

279
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,700
Then light turns to dark.

280
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,400
Life to death...

281
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,800
forever.

282
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,100
A Mondoshawan spaceship requests
permission to enter our territory.

283
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:15,000
Give it permission to enter
with our warmest regards.

284
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,100
Thank you.

285
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,300
Permission to enter granted.

286
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,600
Show time.

287
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,700
We are lost.

288
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,700
Aknot, we are connected to Earth.

289
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,100
Mr. Zorg's office.

290
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,500
It's Aknot.

291
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,100
I'm so glad
to hear you, Aknot.

292
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,700
The mission is accomplished.

293
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:40,300
You'll have what you asked for
in a few hours.

294
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:44,200
Good.
I'll meet you at my factory.

295
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,800
The attack was by
two unregistered warships.

296
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,600
Close all borders and
declare a state of general alert.

297
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,700
Try to contact the Mondoshawans.
We owe them an explanation.

298
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,300
Three hundred years
of waiting for nothing.

299
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,600
Go get some rest.

300
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,000
No.

301
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,200
The Mondoshawan...

302
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,000
I am their contact.

303
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,600
They will come for me.

304
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,400
This is government business.
I'll keep you informed.

305
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,900
The rescue team has reported
from the crash site.

306
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,400
Any survivors?

307
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,900
Only one.

308
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,700
You call that a survivor?

309
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
A few cells still alive.
More than I need.

310
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,500
Have you identified it?

311
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,200
The computer went
off the charts.

312
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,200
Normal human beings
have 40 DNA memo groups...

313
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,900
which is enough
for any species to perpetuate.

314
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:36,100
This has 200,000 memo groups.

315
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,100
Sounds like
a freak of nature.

316
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,300
Yeah, can't wait
to meet him.

317
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,700
You okay?
Over here.

318
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
Excuse me.

319
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,600
General, I want
to show you something.

320
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,000
This is a normal
human DNA chain.

321
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:10,300
You, me, anybody, right?

322
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Watch this.

323
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,100
The compositional elements
of his DNA chain are like ours.

324
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,500
There's simply more of them,
with infinite genetic knowledge.

325
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,400
Almost like this being
was engineered.

326
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,800
Is there any danger?

327
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,100
We put it through
the cellular hygiene detector.

328
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,300
The cell is,
for lack of a better word...

329
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,300
perfect.

330
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,500
Go ahead.

331
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,400
Mr. Perfect better be polite.

332
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,700
Otherwise, I turn him
into cat food.

333
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,500
Activate it.

334
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Tissue processing.

335
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:33,200
Ten seconds to
ultraviolet protection.

336
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,700
This is the last phase.

337
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:45,000
The cells are bombarded by atoms
which forces the body to react.

338
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:46,700
That means
growing skin.

339
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,300
Wonderful.

340
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,900
Reconstruction complete.

341
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,900
Remove the shield.

342
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,800
I told you.
Perfect.

343
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,600
Thermal bandages.

344
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,500
I'd...

345
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,300
like to take
a few pictures...

346
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,600
for the archives.

347
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,800
- What's she saying?
- I don't know.

348
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,500
Activate the phonic detector.

349
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,400
Is that thing solid?

350
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,000
- Unbreakable.
- Good.

351
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
If you want out...

352
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,700
you'll have to develop
those communication skills.

353
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,100
General alert.

354
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,200
Perfect.

355
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,500
Ladder on 18.

356
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,800
Two men with me.
The rest in the main ventilation.

357
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,200
This way.

358
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,500
Lady, stay calm.

359
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,200
This is the police.

360
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,500
There's nowhere
else to go.

361
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,600
Slowly turn around
and put your hands on the floor.

362
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,400
Do you understand?

363
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,100
She doesn't.

364
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,700
I think we need
a flying unit.

365
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:48,100
This is the police.

366
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,500
This is the police.

367
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,800
We are processing
your identification.

368
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,400
Put your arms up
and follow our instructions.

369
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,800
She has no file.

370
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,400
She dove off.

371
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,800
You just had an accident.

372
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Yes, I know I just had an accident,
you daffy bastard!

373
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,700
You have one point left
on your license.

374
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,400
Look out!

375
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,800
Left!

376
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,400
I can't believe it.
Shit.

377
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,700
Any survivors?

378
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Hi.

379
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,600
Are you okay?

380
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,400
Boom.

381
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:41,000
Boom. Yeah,
I understand "boom."

382
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
Bada boom.

383
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,100
Big.

384
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,800
Big bada boom.

385
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,900
Big...

386
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,800
bada big boom.

387
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,300
Big boom.

388
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,900
Yeah, big bada boom.

389
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,200
Bada boom.

390
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,800
Big boom.
Big bada boom.

391
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,600
You're lucky you're not dead.

392
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,300
This is a police control.

393
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,300
Please keep your hands
on the wheel.

394
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
You have an unauthorized passenger
in your vehicle.

395
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,600
We are going
to arrest her.

396
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,400
Thank you for cooperating.

397
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,000
Sorry, honey.

398
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,100
Looks like
this is your ride.

399
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,300
Open the door.

400
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,400
Do what they say.

401
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,700
Sorry.

402
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,500
"Please...

403
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,800
help."

404
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,600
I only have one point
left on my license.

405
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,500
I need it to get back to the garage
and get the cab a six-month overhaul.

406
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,000
You understand?

407
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,300
Can you please
open the passenger door?

408
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,400
Please...

409
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,800
help.

410
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,000
I can't.

411
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,100
I repeat...

412
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,900
open the passenger door.

413
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,700
Yeah, yeah, sure.

414
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,200
Why not?

415
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
Thank you
for your cooperation.

416
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,700
Help.

417
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Finger's going
to kill me.

418
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
Emergency!
Emergency!

419
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,600
One point has
been removed.

420
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,800
Yes, I know!

421
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,000
This is so stupid.

422
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,500
Assist in pursuit
of yellow cab.

423
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,700
Unit 47,
we're on the way...

424
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,200
after we finish lunch.

425
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:28,100
Two golden menus.

426
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,900
I'm too old, too tired and too hungry
to go chasing some hot rod.

427
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,300
Thank you so much.

428
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,200
And I'm definitely
too thirsty.

429
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,500
Look out!

430
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,300
We got lucky.

431
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,200
If they don't chase you after a mile,
they don't chase you.

432
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,800
Maybe two miles.

433
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Hang on.

434
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
Look, lady...

435
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,000
I only speak English
and bad English!

436
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,400
Run an ID.

437
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,400
I'm all for conversation, but maybe
you can just shut up for a minute!

438
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,700
He's got a scan blocker.

439
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,600
Means he's a car thief.
Blast him.

440
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,600
I don't know
what you did...

441
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,400
but they are pissed off!

442
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,500
Hold on!

443
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,800
We're safe for a while.

444
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,200
You want to play soft?
I'll play soft.

445
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,800
You want to play hard?
Let's play hard.

446
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,500
If we get to the fog,
we'll be okay.

447
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,700
If we make the fog.

448
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,600
How do they expect us
to find anything in this shit?

449
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:24,200
We're just going to wait here until
things quiet down if you don't mind.

450
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,200
Shit.

451
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,900
You okay?

452
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:53,200
Priest.

453
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
You don't need a priest,
just a doctor.

454
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,300
Vito Cornelius.

455
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,500
What?

456
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,500
Priest.

457
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:06,800
Yes?

458
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,700
I'm looking
for a priest.

459
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,600
The weddings are downstairs, my son.
Congratulations.

460
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,900
She's not my bride.
She's my fare.

461
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
She's looking for
Vito Cornelius.

462
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The phone book
said he lived here.

463
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:24,200
Yes, that's me,
but I don't know who she is.

464
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,000
Nobody does.
No file, no ID, nothing.

465
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
She's got a tattoo
on this arm.

466
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,100
Tattoo?

467
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,400
Fifth...

468
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,100
element.

469
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,400
Finger's going
to kill me.

470
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:55,200
- Hey! Wake up!
- Who are you?

471
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,700
I brought the girl, remember?
The redhead.

472
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,300
She just dropped in on me.

473
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,900
Started speaking
a bizarre language.

474
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,400
It's not bizarre.
It's the divine language.

475
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,400
It's the ancient language...

476
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,600
spoken throughout the universe
before time was time.

477
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,600
He's a she.

478
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,100
You noticed that.

479
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,300
Yes.

480
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,900
- It's a miracle.
- Miracle she's not dead.

481
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,800
Not a moment to lose.
Wake her up.

482
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,700
But gently,
because this woman is...

483
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:33,300
mankind's most precious possession.

484
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,100
She is perfect.

485
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,100
Perfect.

486
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:49,500
More dignified.

487
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,200
Hey, lady...

488
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,600
wake up.

489
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,800
I shouldn't
have done that.

490
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,300
It was wrong
to kiss you.

491
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,100
He said
to wake you gently.

492
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,700
You're right.

493
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,100
Just thought you might
remember me from the cab.

494
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,800
Remember?

495
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
"Bada boom?"

496
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,900
"Big bada boom?"

497
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:26,000
Boom. Big bada boom.
In the cab. Look.

498
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:28,600
I drive a cab.
This is me.

499
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,400
Korben Dallas.

500
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,700
Korben.
You understand?

501
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,300
Here.

502
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,500
Take it.

503
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,500
You can call me
when you learn English.

504
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,500
Just kidding.

505
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,400
What is your name?

506
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,100
You.

507
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,800
Korben.

508
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,500
Leeloo Minai Lekarariba-Laminai-Tchai
Ekbat De Sebat.

509
00:42:58,600 --> 00:42:59,600
Good.

510
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,600
All that's your name?

511
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:04,500
Do you have...

512
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,800
a shorter name?

513
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,100
Short.

514
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,500
Korben Dallas.

515
00:43:18,700 --> 00:43:19,900
Leeloo.

516
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,300
Leeloo.

517
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:25,800
Korben, Leeloo.

518
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:27,800
Leeloo, Korben.

519
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,500
You're sure
she's a Supreme Being?

520
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:49,400
Absolutely sure.

521
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,000
Old friends.

522
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,500
Yeah, you're right.

523
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,500
- Ask her for my gun back.
- What's your name?

524
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
Korben Dallas.

525
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,000
Thank you for your help.

526
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,000
You've been kind,
but now the girl needs to rest.

527
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,200
She's been on
a long trip.

528
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,600
I know.
I was there when she landed.

529
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,100
Wait, wait, Father.

530
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:14,700
She said something
I didn't understand.

531
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,200
What does
"ekto gamat" mean?

532
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,700
"Never without my permission."

533
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,900
That's what I thought.

534
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:30,900
I shouldn't have
kissed her.

535
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,100
Oh, no. I'm so sorry.
I forgot your food.

536
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:44,000
How about some
nice Thai food?

537
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,200
Yeah, yeah, hold on.

538
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,800
Buddy, I'm waiting
all day here.

539
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,700
- Finger.
- Where's the cab?

540
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:52,800
Car's running fine.

541
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,700
Fine. What "fine"?

542
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,700
I know you.
"Fine" ain't in your vocabulary.

543
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:00,200
You can tell your old buddy Finger
what happened.

544
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:01,600
What? You save the planet?

545
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:06,400
You dinged the fender again.
That's it, right?

546
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:10,200
I was on my way to see you,
and a fare fell in my lap.

547
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,600
One of these big fares
you can't resist.

548
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,600
How big?

549
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:25,900
Five-nine...

550
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,700
blue eyes...

551
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,900
long legs, great skin.

552
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,000
You know?
Perfect.

553
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,800
I see.

554
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:37,800
And this perfect fare,
she got a name?

555
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,500
Leeloo.

556
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,300
What's she doing?

557
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,400
Learning our history,
the last 5,000 years that she missed.

558
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,300
She's been asleep
for a while.

559
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,700
I know she's been through a lot,
but we don't have much time.

560
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,900
You're right.

561
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:15,900
Chicken.

562
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,300
Good.

563
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:22,200
Chicken.

564
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,300
I'm really sorry
to interrupt you, but...

565
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:31,900
the case...

566
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,000
with the stones...

567
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,200
where is it?

568
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:39,800
Stolen?

569
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,000
Who in God's name
would do such a thing?

570
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,000
Excuse me, sir.

571
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:53,300
The council is worried
about the economy heating up.

572
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:56,100
Is it possible
to fire 500,000?

573
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:00,700
I thought from a smaller company,
like one of the cab companies.

574
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,700
Fire one million.

575
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,900
But 500,000--

576
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,000
One million.

577
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,200
Fine, sir.

578
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,300
Sorry to have
disturbed you.

579
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,400
It's for the Supreme...

580
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:30,900
Sorry.

581
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,300
I didn't know your size,
and I found you this makeup box.

582
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,200
You just put it like that.

583
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,700
Yes, there was
a man with a limp...

584
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:45,500
came here a month ago
asking about the stones.

585
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,200
Said he was an art dealer.

586
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:51,900
What was his name?

587
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,600
I'm bad with names.

588
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:05,400
- They really make her--
- Perfect, I know.

589
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:11,200
What'd she say?

590
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,300
She says she knows
exactly where they are.

591
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,700
My dear Aknot, how about
those two planes you borrowed?

592
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:24,900
Aknot, is that you?

593
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,700
What an ugly face.

594
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,300
It doesn't suit you.

595
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,600
Take it off.

596
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,100
That's better.

597
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,900
Never be ashamed
of who you are.

598
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:37,600
You're warriors.
Be proud.

599
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,300
So what if the federal government
scattered you to the wind.

600
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:44,500
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

601
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,500
Your time for revenge
is at hand.

602
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,200
The ZF-1.

603
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,400
It's light. The handle's adjustable
for easy carrying.

604
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:00,000
Breaks down into four parts,
undetectable by X-ray. Discreet.

605
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:02,200
A word on fire power:

606
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,000
Titanium recharger, 3,000-round clip,
with bursts of 3 to 300.

607
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:09,000
With the replay button,
a Zorg invention, it's even easier.

608
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:11,200
One shot...

609
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,100
and replay sends every following shot
to the same location.

610
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,600
And to finish the job,
all the Zorg oldies but goldies.

611
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:27,300
Rocket launcher.

612
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,600
Arrow launcher...

613
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:32,600
with exploding
or poisonous heads.

614
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,300
Very practical.

615
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,700
Net launcher.

616
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:39,600
The flamethrower.

617
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:45,100
My favorite.

618
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:47,600
And for the grand finale...

619
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:50,200
the new Ice Cube System.

620
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,500
Four full crates...

621
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,200
delivered right on time.

622
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,300
And what about you,
dear Aknot?

623
00:50:05,500 --> 00:50:07,000
Did you bring
what I asked?

624
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:10,000
Yes.

625
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,000
Magnificent.

626
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:22,400
This--

627
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,300
This case is empty.

628
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,000
Empty?

629
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:30,000
Empty...

630
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,900
the opposite of full.

631
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:35,400
This case
is supposed to be full!

632
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,500
Anyone care to explain?

633
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:45,800
The Guardians gave the stones
to someone they could trust.

634
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,100
Who took another route.

635
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:55,300
She's supposed
to contact this person...

636
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,100
in a hotel.

637
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:03,000
And she's looking
for the address.

638
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,200
Easy.

639
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,400
Dot.

640
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,700
It's Planet Fhloston,
in the Angel Constellation.

641
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,900
We're saved.

642
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,200
I'm screwed.

643
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,700
You asked for a case.
We brought one.

644
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,300
A case with four stones
in it!

645
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,700
Not one or two or three,
but four!

646
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:28,100
Four stones!

647
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:31,100
But what the hell am I supposed to do
with an empty case?

648
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,400
We are warriors,
not merchants.

649
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:36,800
But you can still count!
Look at my fingers.

650
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:38,400
Four stones, four crates.

651
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:41,400
Zero stones, zero crates!

652
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,500
Pack everything up!
We're out of here!

653
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,200
We risked our lives.

654
00:51:49,500 --> 00:51:53,300
I believe a little compensation
is in order.

655
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,600
So you are merchants
after all.

656
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,600
Leave him one crate
for the cause.

657
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,000
I don't like warriors.

658
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,400
Narrow-minded,
no subtlety...

659
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,800
and they fight
for hopeless causes, honor.

660
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,800
Honor's killed millions of people.
Hasn't saved a single one.

661
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,400
I'll tell you what I do like:
a killer.

662
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:20,100
A dyed-in-the-wool killer,
cold-blooded, clean and methodical.

663
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:22,200
A real killer
picking up the ZF-1...

664
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,900
would've asked about the red button
on the bottom of the gun.

665
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,800
Bring me the priest.

666
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,800
I got everything we need
to know about Fhloston Paradise...

667
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,500
and a blueprint
of the hotel.

668
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:55,900
Good work, my son.
Now to find a way there.

669
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,700
It won't be easy.
There's a charity ball tomorrow.

670
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:02,200
Flights are full,
and the hotel will be guarded.

671
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:03,800
There must be a way.

672
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:11,300
I'll get it.

673
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:14,300
Weddings?

674
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Not really.

675
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:21,000
- Mr. Zorg would like to talk to you.
- Who?

676
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:22,800
Mr. Zorg.

677
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,400
Jean-Baptiste...

678
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,700
Emmanuel...

679
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:26,900
Zorg.

680
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:32,700
It's nice to see
you again, Father.

681
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:35,200
I remember you now.

682
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,300
The so-called art dealer.

683
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:40,600
I'm glad you got
your memory back.

684
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,600
Because you'll need it.

685
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:46,200
Where are the stones?

686
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:47,800
I don't know.

687
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,300
If I did, I wouldn't tell
someone like you.

688
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:51,800
Why?

689
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,900
What's wrong with me?

690
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,700
I try to serve life.

691
00:53:57,100 --> 00:53:58,700
But you only...

692
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,500
want to destroy it.

693
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,800
Father...

694
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:05,600
you're so wrong.

695
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,900
Let me explain.

696
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:15,900
Life, which you so nobly serve,
comes from destruction and chaos.

697
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:17,500
Take this empty glass.

698
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,500
Here it is, peaceful...

699
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,600
boring.

700
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,600
But if it is...

701
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:24,900
destroyed.

702
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,000
Look at all these little things.
So busy now.

703
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,900
Notice how each is useful.

704
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,900
What a lovely ballet ensues...

705
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,700
so full of form and color.

706
00:54:40,900 --> 00:54:44,300
Now think of all those people
that created them.

707
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:48,900
Technicians, engineers. People who
can feed their children tonight...

708
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,000
so those children can grow up
and have children...

709
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,500
and so on.

710
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,600
Thus adding
to the great chain...

711
00:54:58,100 --> 00:54:59,600
of life.

712
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:03,800
Water. Fruit.

713
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:07,600
You see, Father,
by creating a little destruction...

714
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,000
I'm encouraging life.

715
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,400
In reality,
you and I are in the same business.

716
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:15,300
Cheers.

717
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,700
Where's the robot
to pat you on the back?

718
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,400
Or the engineer?

719
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,500
Or their children, maybe?

720
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,600
There, you see how all your
so-called power counts for nothing?

721
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:02,400
How your entire empire
of destruction comes...

722
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,900
crashing down...

723
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,400
all because of one, little...

724
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,200
cherry.

725
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,200
You saved my life...

726
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,600
and in return,
I'll spare yours...

727
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,300
for now.

728
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:29,300
You're a monster, Zorg.

729
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,400
I know.

730
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:39,300
Torture who you have to,
the President, I don't care.

731
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,500
Just bring me the stones.

732
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:43,300
You have one hour.

733
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:01,600
It's gobbling up
all the satellites in the galaxy.

734
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,400
Why is it eating up
all the satellites?

735
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,400
We're working on it.

736
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:22,200
The Mondoshawan deplore the incident
but accept our apologies.

737
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,700
And the stones?
Did you find them?

738
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,900
They weren't on board.

739
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,200
What?

740
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,200
The Mondoshawan never
fully trusted the human race.

741
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,200
They gave them
to someone they do trust.

742
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:36,100
Her name is Plavalaguna.
She's a diva.

743
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,600
She's singing at a charity ball
in Fhloston Paradise.

744
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,600
She has the stones.

745
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,100
The Mondoshawans will help.

746
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:45,900
We must send someone...

747
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,400
to get the stones.

748
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:48,600
Excellent.

749
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:53,800
I want this operation to be
as discreet as possible.

750
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,200
No troops.
No big operation.

751
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:59,000
I want your best man
to go undercover.

752
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,000
I have the perfect one.

753
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:06,600
You've got a message.

754
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,100
Not opening it?
Could be important.

755
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,600
Like the last two
were important.

756
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:16,400
First one was from my wife
telling me she's leaving.

757
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,500
The second was from my lawyer
telling me he was leaving with my wife.

758
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,600
That is bad luck.

759
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,000
Grandfather say...

760
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:27,600
"It never rain everyday."
This is good news, guaranteed.

761
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,800
I bet you lunch.

762
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,300
Okay.

763
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:36,500
Come on.

764
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:40,200
"You are fired."

765
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

766
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,900
At least I won lunch.

767
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,400
Good philosophy.

768
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,300
See good in bad.
I like.

769
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,200
- Hello.
- Korben, sweetheart.

770
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,800
You got broken fingers?
You can't punch my number?

771
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,900
Hi, Mom.

772
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,100
Seventeen messages.

773
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,700
Don't say your machine is broken again.
They last 1,000 years.

774
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,400
Mr. Kim,
you should go.

775
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:09,400
This'll take a minute.

776
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:12,400
You don't feed your cat a croquette,
who you love more than me.

777
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:14,900
She didn't breast-feed you.
I did.

778
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,000
Good fortune for you.

779
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:21,100
You don't have a girl.
I'll never be a grandmother.

780
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,000
It bring you good luck!

781
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:33,600
My body's failing.
Take me on this trip.

782
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,100
What are you
talking about?

783
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,000
You want to make me beg?

784
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,700
No, all I want
is an explanation.

785
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:41,000
I just got in.

786
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,000
I just smashed my cab.
I lost my job. I got mugged.

787
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,600
Besides that,
everything's peachy.

788
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:47,400
Thanks for asking.

789
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,500
Now settle down
and explain this to me.

790
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
You don't know
you won a trip...

791
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,900
to Fhloston Paradise for two
for ten days?

792
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:59,700
I suppose you'll just leave me
on the lunar surface?

793
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:02,700
If I'd won a trip,
I'd know.

794
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,900
I would've been notified.

795
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:10,400
They've been blaring your name out
on the radio for an hour.

796
01:00:14,900 --> 01:00:16,100
I'll call you back.

797
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:23,000
General, how nice to see you
in the 5000 block.

798
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,400
Nice apartment.

799
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:28,700
You've settled
into a wonderful life.

800
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,400
Heard you lost your job.

801
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:33,200
You heard that?

802
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:36,900
Don't worry.
I'll get another job.

803
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,100
Don't bother.
We have one for you.

804
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:40,700
"Major Dallas...

805
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,400
you've been selected
for a mission."

806
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:44,700
- What mission?
- To save the world.

807
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,400
"You leave
for Fhloston Paradise.

808
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,400
Get four stones from the diva
Plavalaguna and bring them back."

809
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,600
Any questions?

810
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,000
Why me? I retired
six months ago. Remember?

811
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:57,400
Three reasons.

812
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,800
One:

813
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,700
As a member
of the Elite Special Forces Unit...

814
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:05,100
you are an expert in the use of
all necessary weapons and spacecraft.

815
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,800
Two: You're the most highly
decorated member of your unit.

816
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,000
The third?

817
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:13,100
Of all the members of your unit,
you're the only one left alive.

818
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,300
Check your messages?

819
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:17,000
I've had enough good news.

820
01:01:17,300 --> 01:01:18,700
Might be important.

821
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:22,500
You're a winner!

822
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:25,900
You've won the Gemini Contest
and a trip to Fhloston Paradise for two.

823
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,500
Here are your tickets.

824
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,700
You rigged the contest?

825
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,500
Congratulations.

826
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:38,800
You couldn't
be more discreet?

827
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,200
Old tricks are the best tricks.

828
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:44,100
Major Iceborg will
accompany you as your wife.

829
01:01:47,300 --> 01:01:48,400
I am not going.

830
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:50,900
Why not?

831
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:03,600
Excuse me, General.

832
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:06,900
Who is it?

833
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,000
Who is it?

834
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:11,800
My wife.

835
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:13,000
You remarried?

836
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,600
Yes... no. I just met this girl,
but I'm going to marry her.

837
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,600
I love her,
but she hates the military.

838
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,800
She knows the military
ruined my last marriage.

839
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:21,100
She can't have anything
to do with it.

840
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,600
If she sees you,
she'll kill me.

841
01:02:22,900 --> 01:02:24,500
- Major--
- You gotta hide somewhere.

842
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:26,100
You've gotta help me.

843
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,400
We'd love to,
but where can we hide?

844
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:34,100
We don't
have time for this.

845
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,700
It's just for one minute.

846
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:38,000
You have no idea
how much you're helping me.

847
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,200
No idea--
You have no idea.

848
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:42,700
- I'm going to be happily married.
- Major! Major!

849
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:45,100
- The three of us won't fit.
- Sure you will.

850
01:02:47,200 --> 01:02:48,900
Major!

851
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,600
You're on my foot.

852
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,100
Major! Major!

853
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:02,100
I'm really sorry to resort to this,
Mr. Wallace--

854
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:03,100
Dallas.

855
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:07,200
We heard about your good luck
and need your tickets for Fhloston.

856
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,300
Is this the way
priests vacation?

857
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,100
We're on a mission.

858
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,500
What kind?

859
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,400
We have to save
the world, my son.

860
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,500
You're gonna
save the world?

861
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,400
Yes!

862
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,000
Down there.
Down there.

863
01:03:33,900 --> 01:03:36,500
This is a police control.

864
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,300
This is not an exercise.

865
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:44,000
Come on, get in.
For one minute, all right?

866
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,100
Just stay here
for one minute.

867
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:49,200
- This is a police control.
- Don't touch anything.

868
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:52,000
This is not an exercise.

869
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:54,700
Can you please spread your legs...

870
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,700
and place your hands
in the yellow circles.

871
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,200
- What are you doing?
- Saving you so you can save the world.

872
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:01,600
Yeah, but I--

873
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,600
I think this is the door.
No name, no number.

874
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:06,900
Let's see it.

875
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,300
Are you classified
as human?

876
01:04:13,500 --> 01:04:16,200
Negative.
I am a meat Popsicle.

877
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,100
I found him.

878
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:22,200
Mr. Korben Dallas?

879
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:26,600
Sir, can you put your hands
in the yellow circles, please?

880
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:31,500
Smoke you!

881
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:34,100
Wrong answer.

882
01:04:36,800 --> 01:04:39,600
The police control
is now terminated.

883
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:44,000
Thank you for your cooperation.
Have a nice day.

884
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:47,000
We got the guy.
Wasn't easy but we bagged him.

885
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:49,500
- Thanks for the tip.
- Glad to be of help, my friend.

886
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,900
The guy's been arrested
for uranium smuggling.

887
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:57,300
All I have to do now is go
to the airport, take his place...

888
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:00,000
and I'll be in Fhloston
in four hours.

889
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:02,700
Don't come back
without the stones.

890
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:21,700
We got Korben Dallas.

891
01:05:21,900 --> 01:05:23,000
Perfect.

892
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:25,200
Akanit, take command.

893
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,300
Go to Fhloston
and get the stones.

894
01:05:28,500 --> 01:05:30,300
If Zorg really wants them...

895
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:32,700
he'll have to negotiate.

896
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,400
Revenge is at hand.

897
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:41,000
Oh, I am so sorry.

898
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,100
I forgot
about the autowash.

899
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,500
There's an autowash
in that shower.

900
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,100
I'm so sorry.

901
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:54,600
Autowash.

902
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,600
Autowash, yes.
Autowash, in the shower.

903
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,800
It's funny.
I've met you twice today.

904
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Both times
you've ended up in my arms.

905
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,400
It's my lucky day.

906
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,200
Lucky day.

907
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:22,100
Did you hear something?

908
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:24,500
Cornelius.

909
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:31,800
Autowash.

910
01:06:33,100 --> 01:06:35,600
- I'm so sorry.
- I don't need your help.

911
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,100
- Want a cup of coffee?
- Yes, please.

912
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:44,100
Autowash.

913
01:06:45,300 --> 01:06:47,100
Coffee's not my specialty.

914
01:06:48,600 --> 01:06:51,600
But you must drink a lot
of coffee being a priest.

915
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,300
I know. I'm not proud of what I did.
I had no choice.

916
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:14,200
I'll take the mission.

917
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:33,000
- Did you get them?
- Yeah.

918
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:34,300
Good.

919
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,900
- "Leeloo Dallas."
- "Multi-pass."

920
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,800
"Korben David Dallas."
Perfect.

921
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,800
I can't be your husband.
I'm too old.

922
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,700
Now David is...

923
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,500
in great shape.
he'll protect you.

924
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,800
Now, please, go to the Diva, collect
the stones and meet me at the temple.

925
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,400
Now. Yes.

926
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:00,000
Okay.

927
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:07,000
Last call for Fhloston Paradise.
Hurry.

928
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,900
The tickets.

929
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:14,600
- ID, please.
- I'm sorry.

930
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:18,000
- There.
- In here?

931
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:20,500
Mr. Dallas?

932
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,700
Congratulations on the contest.

933
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,700
Oh, right. Okay.

934
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,400
- Sorry for the mess.
- The mess?

935
01:08:29,700 --> 01:08:30,700
The garbage.

936
01:08:35,500 --> 01:08:37,000
Made it!

937
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,700
I was afraid
I wouldn't make it...

938
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:43,100
so I sent David
to pick up my boarding pass.

939
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:44,300
Now David must go.

940
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:46,300
Thank you. Bye.

941
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,200
I am Korben Dallas.

942
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,900
Please report infractions
immediately to the spaceport.

943
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,400
And this is?

944
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,800
Leeloo Dallas.
Multi-pass.

945
01:08:58,700 --> 01:08:59,800
Multi-pass.

946
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,700
She knows
it's a multi-pass.

947
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:04,800
My wife.
We're newlyweds. Just met.

948
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:08,600
Bump into each other, sparks happen--
She knows.

949
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,300
Anyway, we're in love.

950
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:14,600
I mean, I know
she's made to be strong.

951
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:18,100
She's also so fragile, so human.
You know what I mean?

952
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,600
- You want more?
- Yeah.

953
01:09:28,100 --> 01:09:29,100
Make that two.

954
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:33,100
- Where's Leeloo?
- On the plane with Mr. Dallas.

955
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:34,600
What!

956
01:09:34,700 --> 01:09:36,300
I didn't know
what to do.

957
01:09:36,700 --> 01:09:39,100
But this is not possible.

958
01:09:39,700 --> 01:09:41,200
This is not possible.

959
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,700
You want some more?

960
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,200
This is all my fault.

961
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:47,700
It is my mission.
I shouldn't have given it to you.

962
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:48,900
I know.

963
01:09:50,700 --> 01:09:52,700
- The key to the temple.
- Oh, no.

964
01:09:52,800 --> 01:09:55,700
Prepare for our arrival.
I go to face my destiny.

965
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,000
I don't want
to go to Egypt.

966
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:05,900
Dallas?
Korben Dallas?

967
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,200
That's me.

968
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:12,400
Just a minute, please.

969
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:20,400
It will just take
one more minute.

970
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:31,400
We'll be right back.

971
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:36,600
Mr. Dallas...

972
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,500
we really need you now.

973
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,900
Ruby Rhod is broadcasting live
and needs to interview you.

974
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:44,300
Multi-pass.

975
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:51,300
Tell Aknot that plan A flopped.
Go to plan B.

976
01:10:52,700 --> 01:10:54,900
Aliens ahead.
Spread out.

977
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:06,100
Backup unit, zone 18.

978
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:21,300
Ruby Rhod is the biggest radio star.
It's an honor to be on his talk show.

979
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,400
He's so green.

980
01:11:23,700 --> 01:11:24,800
I'm sure you're excited.

981
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:27,000
I'm on vacation
and don't want to be bothered.

982
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:29,100
I prefer to remain anonymous.

983
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:34,400
Korben Dallas!

984
01:11:34,600 --> 01:11:38,800
Here he is! The winner of
the Gemini Croquette Contest.

985
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:42,800
This boy is fuelled like fire,
so start melting, ladies...

986
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:45,500
'cause he is hotter than hot.
He's hot, hot, hot!

987
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,400
The right size, the right build,
the right hair, the right on.

988
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,900
Right on.

989
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,100
And he's got
something to say...

990
01:11:55,300 --> 01:11:57,700
to those 50 billion pairs of ears
out there.

991
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,500
Pop it, D-man.

992
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:04,500
Hi.

993
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:07,000
Unbelievable.

994
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:12,100
Quiver, ladies.
He's going to set the world on fire.

995
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:13,600
Right here
from five to seven.

996
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,400
You'll know everything
there is to know about the D-man.

997
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:19,000
His dreams...

998
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:20,500
his desires...

999
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:23,400
his most intimates of intimates.

1000
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:26,400
And from what I'm looking at,
intimate is his middle name.

1001
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,400
So tell me, my man...

1002
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,000
you nervous in the service?

1003
01:12:32,900 --> 01:12:34,500
Not really.

1004
01:12:35,200 --> 01:12:38,800
Freeze those knees 'cause Korben's
in the place and he's on the case.

1005
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:42,900
Yesterday's frog
will be tomorrow's Prince...

1006
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:45,300
of Fhloston Paradise!

1007
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:48,700
The hotel of a thousand and one
follies and lollies.

1008
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,300
A magic fountain flowing
with nonstop wine, women and...

1009
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,200
hootchie-kootchie-koo...

1010
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,000
all night long.

1011
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,300
All night long
All night

1012
01:13:04,400 --> 01:13:08,900
Start licking stamps, girls, because
he'll have you writing home to Mama.

1013
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:12,100
Here from five to seven,
I'll be your voice, your tongue.

1014
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:16,500
On the trail of the sexiest
man of the year: D-man, your man...

1015
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,000
my man.

1016
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,000
End of transmission.

1017
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,900
See you tomorrow at five.

1018
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:28,200
How was it?

1019
01:13:31,100 --> 01:13:33,100
It was just absolutely green.

1020
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:35,700
Green like what?

1021
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,000
Crystal green.

1022
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:40,100
Any kind of green
you want...

1023
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,200
tree green, emerald,
pond green.

1024
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:59,200
Korben, sweetheart, what was that?
It was bad! It had nothing!

1025
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:02,900
No fire! No energy!
I have a show to run here.

1026
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,500
It must pop, pop, pop!

1027
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,100
So tomorrow, from five to seven...

1028
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:09,500
please act like you have
more than a two-word vocabulary.

1029
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:12,600
It must be green!
Okay? Okay?

1030
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:15,900
Can I talk to you for a second?
Just talk to you?

1031
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,300
I didn't come here to play
Pumba on the radio.

1032
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:22,400
Tomorrow, from five to seven,
you'll give yourself a hand.

1033
01:14:22,900 --> 01:14:23,800
Green?

1034
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:25,300
Super green.

1035
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,900
Dallas? Korben Dallas?

1036
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,300
That's me.

1037
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,700
I only have one Korben Dallas
on my list, and he's checked in.

1038
01:14:39,000 --> 01:14:41,900
That's impossible.
I am Korben Dallas.

1039
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,800
Sorry, sir.
Boarding is finished.

1040
01:14:45,500 --> 01:14:47,700
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait!

1041
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,800
I need to talk
to someone!

1042
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,700
I don't believe this!

1043
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:57,000
This is not an exercise.
This is a police control.

1044
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,300
I'm sorry. I'm calm.

1045
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:01,600
There's been a mistake.
There's been a mistake.

1046
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:04,300
To make your flight short...

1047
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:06,600
flight attendants are switching
on the sleep regulator...

1048
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,700
which will regulate your sleeping
during the flight.

1049
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:15,200
Thank you.

1050
01:15:18,700 --> 01:15:19,600
Hi.

1051
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:22,400
- You speak English.
- Yes. I learn.

1052
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:23,700
Good.

1053
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,400
We are not on vacation.

1054
01:15:26,500 --> 01:15:30,000
I'm on an important mission.
I work for some important people.

1055
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,200
If I hadn't come to get you,
you'd be in trouble.

1056
01:15:33,400 --> 01:15:34,400
Understand?

1057
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:35,700
Yes.

1058
01:15:35,900 --> 01:15:37,900
But you, no trouble.

1059
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,100
Me, Fifth Element.

1060
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:43,800
Supreme Being.

1061
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:46,700
Me protect you.

1062
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,200
Sleep.

1063
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,200
Sweet dreams,
Mr. Dallas.

1064
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:02,800
Sleep regulator operative
in zone one.

1065
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,000
Thank you.

1066
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,300
Are you operative?

1067
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,200
Zone two?

1068
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,600
Everything's ready, Captain.

1069
01:16:09,700 --> 01:16:10,700
What?

1070
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,000
Assume your
individual position.

1071
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:15,000
But I want all positions!

1072
01:16:16,300 --> 01:16:17,600
Mr. Rhod--

1073
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:20,900
Parasites in landing gear.

1074
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:22,000
Ground, copy?

1075
01:16:22,200 --> 01:16:23,700
Got it.
Front gear.

1076
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:26,600
Hey, man,
give me some heat, man!

1077
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,400
We need some heat here!
Get some heat!

1078
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:33,800
Some heat over here, man!

1079
01:16:33,900 --> 01:16:37,100
Good shit, man.
Put the heat over here!

1080
01:16:50,700 --> 01:16:53,300
Thank you!
Thank you very much!

1081
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,500
Come, come.
Give me this. Give me this.

1082
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:04,000
Take that.

1083
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,500
Mr. Rhod!

1084
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,500
You can call me Ruby.

1085
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:12,700
Fueled and ready to go.

1086
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,200
I'll buy you one.

1087
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:20,100
Taken off already?

1088
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:22,500
I'm not on the plane.

1089
01:17:23,100 --> 01:17:24,000
What?

1090
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,900
The real Dallas
took my place.

1091
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,500
I don't understand.

1092
01:17:27,700 --> 01:17:29,200
Are you making fun of me?

1093
01:17:29,300 --> 01:17:31,500
No, no, no!
I swear! I swear!

1094
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,700
I never felt this way before
with a human.

1095
01:17:34,900 --> 01:17:35,900
Really?

1096
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:41,900
I've tried everything.
There's no way to get on the plane.

1097
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:51,100
Ground is clear.

1098
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,800
Ready for liftoff?

1099
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:54,200
Confirmed.

1100
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:02,900
Not there. No, please, not there.
Please, not there.

1101
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:04,800
- Power pressure?
- Primed.

1102
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:10,900
- Protection?
- Confirmed.

1103
01:18:11,600 --> 01:18:13,100
Power increase.

1104
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:14,400
Ten seconds.

1105
01:18:14,500 --> 01:18:16,000
I am...

1106
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:17,900
a little...

1107
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,000
disappointed.

1108
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:20,900
5...

1109
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,600
If there is one thing
I do not like...

1110
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:24,400
3...

1111
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,200
it is to be...

1112
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:27,000
2...

1113
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:29,200
disappointed.

1114
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:30,000
1...

1115
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,200
Sorry, it will
never happen again.

1116
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:33,600
I know.

1117
01:18:33,700 --> 01:18:34,700
Liftoff.

1118
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:49,300
- Landing gear secure.
- Checklist for light speed.

1119
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:17,800
We're finally
getting something.

1120
01:19:18,800 --> 01:19:20,300
It's sending
radio wavelengths.

1121
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,200
What does it want
with radio waves?

1122
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,400
Maybe it wants
to make a call.

1123
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,300
Zorg's office.

1124
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,700
I told you I did not
want to be disturbed.

1125
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:36,900
You don't want to be disturbed
except if it's Mr. Shadow...

1126
01:19:37,100 --> 01:19:38,900
and Mr. Shadow's
on the line.

1127
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,800
It's Shadow again.

1128
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,700
Zorg here.

1129
01:19:52,900 --> 01:19:55,200
Am I disturbing you?

1130
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:57,600
No, no, I was just--

1131
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,200
Where are you?

1132
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,100
Not far now.

1133
01:20:05,700 --> 01:20:06,700
Good.

1134
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,800
Good, good.

1135
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,400
How are the stones?

1136
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,200
Fine. Fine.
Just fine.

1137
01:20:17,900 --> 01:20:21,300
I'll have the four stones
you asked for any time now...

1138
01:20:21,500 --> 01:20:23,200
but it wasn't easy.

1139
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,800
My costs have tripled.

1140
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,800
Money is of no...

1141
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,500
importance.

1142
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:34,300
I...

1143
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:35,800
want...

1144
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:39,100
the stones.

1145
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:40,600
The stones...

1146
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:43,700
will be here.

1147
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,400
I'll see to it
personally.

1148
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:52,000
I will be among you...

1149
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:54,000
soon.

1150
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:57,900
We lost it.

1151
01:20:58,200 --> 01:20:59,600
We lost the signal.

1152
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:00,800
Damn!

1153
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:22,000
We've begun our descent
toward Fhloston Paradise.

1154
01:21:22,100 --> 01:21:24,100
The local time
is 3:20 p.m.

1155
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:28,100
Auto-temperature is currently
85 degrees Fahrenheit.

1156
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:32,100
We hope you enjoyed your flight
and hope to see you again soon.

1157
01:21:51,100 --> 01:21:54,300
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to paradise.

1158
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:07,700
Excuse me, dear. Excuse me.
Excuse me, please.

1159
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,200
Parasites in the main ventilation.

1160
01:22:44,400 --> 01:22:46,100
Again?
I'll get it.

1161
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:56,800
Have we arrived yet?

1162
01:22:58,300 --> 01:22:59,800
Oh, good.

1163
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:03,300
We have twelve swimming pools
and two on the rooftop.

1164
01:23:03,400 --> 01:23:06,500
All the restaurants
are between levels two and ten.

1165
01:23:06,700 --> 01:23:10,800
The planet Fhloston has 400 beaches,
all accessible until 5 p.m...

1166
01:23:10,900 --> 01:23:12,700
then the airship goes higher...

1167
01:23:12,800 --> 01:23:14,400
to offer you a better view.

1168
01:23:14,700 --> 01:23:15,900
Is the Diva here?

1169
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,300
Not yet.

1170
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,000
Any tickets left
for the opera?

1171
01:23:19,500 --> 01:23:21,900
You have a seat reserved,
front row...

1172
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:24,200
next to Ruby Rhod!

1173
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:27,400
He's so talented.
I love him. He's so sexy.

1174
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:31,000
He has your ticket,
and he'll be here in 20 minutes.

1175
01:23:32,500 --> 01:23:34,500
Where can I get
something to wear?

1176
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:40,800
- Enjoy your evening, Mr. Dallas.
- Thank you.

1177
01:23:48,600 --> 01:23:52,000
You miserable bastard,
I never should've pushed you out.

1178
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:55,000
I was in labor for days,
and this is how you repay me?

1179
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,800
I should've gotten
a robot.

1180
01:23:56,900 --> 01:23:58,600
Come on, Ma.

1181
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,000
I should be there, not you.
I need a tan.

1182
01:24:01,200 --> 01:24:02,800
I need a cocktail.

1183
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:26,800
Get the case in.

1184
01:24:30,800 --> 01:24:32,600
Hello, Ms. Diva.
I'm Fog.

1185
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:36,100
Welcome to the--
I'm security.

1186
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,100
Welcome to the--

1187
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,600
Tall.

1188
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,100
- Can I talk to you?
- Sure. Yeah.

1189
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:02,200
- What's your name?
- Fog.

1190
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:07,700
Ms. Plavalaguna is glad
that you are here.

1191
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:10,900
She'll give you what you've come
to get after the concert.

1192
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,000
Stay here.

1193
01:25:14,200 --> 01:25:18,500
You're listening to Radio Cosmos.
It is 5 p.m.

1194
01:25:19,700 --> 01:25:21,700
Helm to 108.

1195
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:24,700
Helm 108!

1196
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,000
Helm to 108.

1197
01:25:27,300 --> 01:25:28,700
Time to join Ruby Rhod...

1198
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,700
and Korben Dallas,
the lucky winner...

1199
01:25:32,900 --> 01:25:35,300
of the Gemini Croquette contest.

1200
01:25:35,500 --> 01:25:38,700
Coming at you live
from Fhloston...

1201
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,200
Paradise!

1202
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:45,300
Ruby Rhod at your service with Korben
and the manager of this hotel...

1203
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,300
and Miss Gemini Croquette
in person...

1204
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:50,500
and 8,000 other lucksters here...

1205
01:25:50,700 --> 01:25:55,500
to enjoy the privilege of
the unique concert of Miss Plavalaguna!

1206
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,200
Now we enter what must be...

1207
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:04,000
the most beautiful concert hall
of all the universe!

1208
01:26:04,200 --> 01:26:08,300
A perfect replica
of an old opera house...

1209
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,400
but who cares?

1210
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:14,200
To my right, a row of ministers,
more sinisters than ministers.

1211
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,900
To my left, Baby Ray,
star of stage and screen.

1212
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:20,900
He's not going to get much
out of this concert. He's stone-deaf!

1213
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,200
To who?

1214
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,200
And here we have Roy Von Baker,
king of laser ball.

1215
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:31,000
The Emperor of Kodar Japhet
and his lovely daughter.

1216
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:34,300
"I love to sing,"
she recently confessed to me.

1217
01:26:34,500 --> 01:26:37,800
By the way, I have a recording
of her talented voice.

1218
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:41,800
I'll play the rest after the concert.
Now it's time...

1219
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:43,700
for Korben to say
the word of the day.

1220
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,300
Tell me, my man, you happy
here in the big world?

1221
01:26:51,300 --> 01:26:53,200
Thrilled.

1222
01:26:54,200 --> 01:26:56,000
And now...

1223
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:57,100
champagne!

1224
01:27:03,200 --> 01:27:05,500
Commercial!
Commercial!

1225
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:07,300
Break for 30 seconds.

1226
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,300
Show time.

1227
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:21,200
I have a ship in trouble
requesting permission to dock.

1228
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:24,200
Put him in the docking garage.
Inform security.

1229
01:29:24,700 --> 01:29:27,600
- Permission granted for one hour.
- More than I need.

1230
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:44,800
Champagne for the Diva.

1231
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,600
I'll take it.

1232
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,800
I found it.

1233
01:30:57,700 --> 01:30:58,700
Get her!

1234
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,300
It was an ambush.

1235
01:32:37,900 --> 01:32:39,800
If it's war they want...

1236
01:32:39,900 --> 01:32:42,100
it's war they'll get!

1237
01:32:45,200 --> 01:32:47,000
Bravo! Bravo!

1238
01:32:47,100 --> 01:32:49,300
Bravo! Bravo!

1239
01:32:49,400 --> 01:32:51,100
My compliments, little lady.

1240
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:52,700
Thank you for doing
the dirty work.

1241
01:32:52,800 --> 01:32:55,700
I couldn't have done
a better job myself.

1242
01:32:56,400 --> 01:32:57,600
Hand over the stones.

1243
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:40,200
Nobody move!
I'm taking over the ship!

1244
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:45,700
Hands up!

1245
01:34:54,600 --> 01:34:56,100
I know this music.

1246
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,600
Let's change the beat.

1247
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,200
I think we're
being attacked.

1248
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:10,700
They're everywhere.

1249
01:35:10,900 --> 01:35:14,000
I see one of them.
They're warriors, and they're ugly.

1250
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:17,400
They got big teeth, and they got
big foreheads, and they stink.

1251
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:18,500
Mangalores.

1252
01:35:21,400 --> 01:35:23,700
The government
sent me to help you.

1253
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:25,500
If somebody hears this,
come and get me.

1254
01:35:25,800 --> 01:35:28,100
I'm in the first row.

1255
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,700
You must give her the stones.

1256
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:32,800
Who?

1257
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,600
The Fifth Element.

1258
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:39,200
The Supreme Being sent to Earth
to save the universe.

1259
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,300
Leeloo?

1260
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:46,100
But she's more fragile
than she seems.

1261
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:48,700
She needs your help...

1262
01:35:49,400 --> 01:35:50,700
and your love...

1263
01:35:51,500 --> 01:35:52,600
or...

1264
01:35:52,900 --> 01:35:55,100
she will die.

1265
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,400
Stay with me.

1266
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:01,800
Help!

1267
01:36:08,900 --> 01:36:11,100
If you want
something done...

1268
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:13,200
do it yourself.

1269
01:36:13,900 --> 01:36:15,900
Come on, honey.
You can't die.

1270
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:18,300
Wake up!
Where are the stones?

1271
01:36:19,300 --> 01:36:20,800
Where are the stones?

1272
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,100
The stones.

1273
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:38,700
They're not here.

1274
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:41,100
The stones,
where are they?

1275
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,800
In me.

1276
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:46,100
What?

1277
01:36:53,300 --> 01:36:54,700
Oh, my God, Korben.

1278
01:36:54,800 --> 01:36:56,500
Korben, another one coming.

1279
01:36:56,700 --> 01:36:59,400
- I think we should go.
- One minute. One minute.

1280
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:00,400
Hey, you!

1281
01:37:02,500 --> 01:37:03,500
I said you.

1282
01:37:03,600 --> 01:37:05,400
- I'm not with him.
- Where's the other?

1283
01:37:08,400 --> 01:37:09,900
I said, "one minute."

1284
01:37:10,100 --> 01:37:11,700
Ruby, hold this gun.

1285
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:13,300
What do you
want me to do?

1286
01:37:13,400 --> 01:37:14,400
Come on.

1287
01:37:14,500 --> 01:37:16,000
Put your hand
on it.

1288
01:37:16,200 --> 01:37:18,500
- What do I do?
- If he moves, squeeze the trigger.

1289
01:37:19,200 --> 01:37:21,100
I don't feel right.

1290
01:37:21,300 --> 01:37:24,600
- I don't feel right.
- The stones are "in me."

1291
01:37:34,200 --> 01:37:36,500
I got a headache.
This ain't me.

1292
01:37:55,100 --> 01:37:56,200
Sorry.

1293
01:37:57,600 --> 01:37:58,600
Think he'll be okay?

1294
01:38:06,200 --> 01:38:08,700
Oh, my God, Korben.
Another one coming.

1295
01:38:11,200 --> 01:38:13,100
Shit. Three coming.

1296
01:38:15,500 --> 01:38:18,100
You guard this
with your life...

1297
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,200
or you'll look like him.
You green?

1298
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:21,400
Green.

1299
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,800
Super green?

1300
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,400
Is that your idea
of a discreet operation?

1301
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:29,400
Don't worry. I know my man.
He'll calm things down.

1302
01:38:56,700 --> 01:38:58,300
Move! Move!

1303
01:38:59,400 --> 01:39:01,500
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1304
01:39:01,600 --> 01:39:02,700
Ladies and gentlemen...

1305
01:39:02,800 --> 01:39:04,400
this is amazing.

1306
01:39:06,500 --> 01:39:08,000
Let me do it.

1307
01:39:15,300 --> 01:39:16,400
Oh, my God.

1308
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,600
Korben Dallas, my man,
is in trouble.

1309
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:26,500
The gun!

1310
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:30,200
Give me the gun.

1311
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:31,600
I'm going to go...

1312
01:39:31,700 --> 01:39:36,000
and try to see if I can see
something a little closer.

1313
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:54,300
Yes, the gun. Yeah.

1314
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,600
Thanks, Ray.

1315
01:40:05,600 --> 01:40:09,300
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
I'm not armed!

1316
01:40:09,500 --> 01:40:10,400
Get up!

1317
01:40:10,600 --> 01:40:13,000
You've got the wrong guy!
Don't shoot!

1318
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:14,500
I'm not armed.

1319
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:19,200
Oh, my God.

1320
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:21,000
I'm on vacation.

1321
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:23,500
Don't shoot me, please.
I'm on a vacation.

1322
01:40:23,500 --> 01:40:24,600
I won a...

1323
01:40:26,400 --> 01:40:27,500
contest.

1324
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:29,700
Gemini Croquette's to...

1325
01:40:29,900 --> 01:40:31,300
Fhloston Paradise.

1326
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,500
Down.

1327
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:38,200
Wait a minute.

1328
01:40:38,300 --> 01:40:39,600
Get down!

1329
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:42,800
He's trying
to say something.

1330
01:40:42,900 --> 01:40:43,900
Down!

1331
01:40:58,300 --> 01:40:59,600
Sorry, my man.

1332
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:10,200
Where are you?

1333
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:13,900
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

1334
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:16,600
They're coming.
They're coming.

1335
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:21,700
Don't move.

1336
01:41:32,900 --> 01:41:34,000
What you doing?

1337
01:41:34,200 --> 01:41:35,800
Count to ten.

1338
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:46,500
- Was that a bomb?
- Shut up and count!

1339
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:49,000
3! 4! 5!

1340
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,300
6...

1341
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:51,400
7, 8...

1342
01:41:52,600 --> 01:41:54,000
9...

1343
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:19,400
10.

1344
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:26,800
I am...

1345
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:29,300
very disappointed.

1346
01:42:29,900 --> 01:42:32,200
Korben, what are you
looking for?

1347
01:42:32,300 --> 01:42:33,500
Control room.

1348
01:42:35,300 --> 01:42:37,000
- This is it.
- I'll be here.

1349
01:42:37,100 --> 01:42:38,500
Let's go.

1350
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:43,500
Quiet! Quiet!

1351
01:42:45,000 --> 01:42:46,300
You in charge?

1352
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:49,000
How many
are out there?

1353
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:51,800
- I don't know.
- Let's count.

1354
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:57,300
Seven on the left.
Five on the right.

1355
01:43:03,800 --> 01:43:05,800
Four on the right.
Two on the left.

1356
01:43:07,100 --> 01:43:09,800
Find the leader.
They won't fight without the leader.

1357
01:43:10,400 --> 01:43:12,800
One more shot and we start
killing hostages.

1358
01:43:13,900 --> 01:43:15,000
That's the leader.

1359
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,000
Send someone to negotiate.

1360
01:43:19,100 --> 01:43:21,500
I've never negotiated.

1361
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:23,700
You mind if I try?

1362
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:28,300
We're sending
somebody to negotiate.

1363
01:43:37,200 --> 01:43:39,300
Anybody else
want to negotiate?

1364
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:42,200
Where did he learn
to negotiate like that?

1365
01:43:42,700 --> 01:43:44,000
I wonder.

1366
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:49,900
Where's Ruby?

1367
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:52,300
I thought he was dead.

1368
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:53,500
Master!

1369
01:43:54,200 --> 01:43:56,700
It was nothing, really.
Just a helping hand.

1370
01:43:57,300 --> 01:43:59,700
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Ruby Rhod...

1371
01:43:59,900 --> 01:44:01,400
still alive.

1372
01:44:02,100 --> 01:44:03,400
What's wrong with you?

1373
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:04,700
It hurt!

1374
01:44:10,700 --> 01:44:14,500
I realize that you must be
pretty mad at me...

1375
01:44:14,700 --> 01:44:17,100
but I'm fighting
for a noble cause.

1376
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:20,100
Yes, you're trying to save the world.
I remember.

1377
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:22,600
Right now,
I'm trying to save Leeloo.

1378
01:44:22,800 --> 01:44:23,900
Leeloo's in trouble?

1379
01:44:24,000 --> 01:44:26,100
When is Leeloo
not in trouble?

1380
01:44:26,600 --> 01:44:28,100
- Where's that?
- The Diva's suite.

1381
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:34,600
Hang on.

1382
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:39,200
Here, come on.

1383
01:44:39,300 --> 01:44:41,300
How do you get yourself
into these positions?

1384
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:43,700
Come on.

1385
01:44:47,000 --> 01:44:50,000
I'm here. It's all right.
Everything's okay now.

1386
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:51,500
Listen.

1387
01:44:54,100 --> 01:44:57,100
I got the stones.
Just take it easy, all right?

1388
01:44:59,700 --> 01:45:03,600
My man, my man, what's this thing
with all these numbers?

1389
01:45:13,700 --> 01:45:15,300
If it was a bomb...

1390
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:19,800
the alarms would go off because
all these hotels have bomb detectors.

1391
01:45:21,700 --> 01:45:24,400
This is a type "A" alert.

1392
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:27,600
For security reasons,
the hotel must be evacuated.

1393
01:45:28,800 --> 01:45:30,500
Proceed calmly
to the lifeboats...

1394
01:45:30,700 --> 01:45:32,200
Stay calm!

1395
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,800
...located in the main hallways.

1396
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:35,200
Stay calm!

1397
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:43,500
You know how to stop this,
right?

1398
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:52,500
Two minutes
to complete evacuation.

1399
01:45:54,500 --> 01:45:55,500
Get back!

1400
01:45:55,700 --> 01:45:57,400
Evacuation!
Evacuation!

1401
01:45:57,500 --> 01:46:00,900
Sorry, you can't stay here.
There's a bomb in the hotel.

1402
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,000
I know.

1403
01:46:22,000 --> 01:46:23,400
I don't want to die.

1404
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:24,700
Please, my son.

1405
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:26,700
Get in.

1406
01:46:31,500 --> 01:46:34,300
One minute to total evacuation.

1407
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:40,000
This one.

1408
01:46:43,400 --> 01:46:45,300
45 seconds.

1409
01:46:48,600 --> 01:46:50,100
Get her strapped in.

1410
01:46:55,700 --> 01:46:57,900
You know how to fly this?

1411
01:46:58,100 --> 01:46:59,300
Like driving a cab.

1412
01:47:04,000 --> 01:47:05,900
How will we
get out the door?

1413
01:47:19,400 --> 01:47:21,200
15 seconds.

1414
01:47:26,000 --> 01:47:27,200
10...

1415
01:47:27,300 --> 01:47:28,800
9, 8...

1416
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,200
7...

1417
01:47:31,500 --> 01:47:32,900
6...

1418
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,200
5.

1419
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,800
For the honor.

1420
01:47:58,900 --> 01:47:59,800
Hold on.

1421
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:23,500
Like driving a cab.

1422
01:48:25,500 --> 01:48:28,100
It is now 7 p.m.,
time for the news.

1423
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:30,200
See you tomorrow
for a new adventure.

1424
01:48:30,700 --> 01:48:32,300
End of transmission.

1425
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,200
That's the best show
I ever did.

1426
01:48:38,200 --> 01:48:40,900
Major Dallas has
the five elements on board...

1427
01:48:41,100 --> 01:48:43,800
and the priest is guiding them
to the temple.

1428
01:48:48,400 --> 01:48:49,700
We're saved.

1429
01:49:05,900 --> 01:49:08,600
The Diva said
I should take care of you.

1430
01:49:09,700 --> 01:49:12,300
Humans act so strange.

1431
01:49:12,400 --> 01:49:13,600
What do you mean?

1432
01:49:15,300 --> 01:49:17,400
Everything you created...

1433
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,100
is used to destroy.

1434
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:22,900
We call it human nature.

1435
01:49:23,000 --> 01:49:25,000
You learn that
on your screen?

1436
01:49:25,200 --> 01:49:28,000
I'm not finished yet.
I'm up to "V."

1437
01:49:28,900 --> 01:49:30,200
"V" is good.

1438
01:49:30,600 --> 01:49:32,500
Some good words in "V."

1439
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,900
Like what?

1440
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:37,600
"Valiant."

1441
01:49:38,100 --> 01:49:39,500
"Vulnerable."

1442
01:49:41,900 --> 01:49:43,600
"Very beautiful."

1443
01:49:55,300 --> 01:49:57,800
Oh, of course, Munro!

1444
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:00,200
Mr. President?

1445
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:01,600
Now what?

1446
01:50:05,000 --> 01:50:06,400
We have a problem.

1447
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,300
It's advancing?

1448
01:50:13,400 --> 01:50:17,000
It's not only advancing,
it's moving at incredible speed.

1449
01:50:21,500 --> 01:50:24,800
And do you have any idea
where it's heading?

1450
01:50:31,700 --> 01:50:34,600
Korben, there's
a general on the phone.

1451
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,000
I'll give you
the President.

1452
01:50:38,300 --> 01:50:41,200
Major Dallas, I first
would like to salute a warrior.

1453
01:50:41,600 --> 01:50:43,800
You're a shining example
of this army.

1454
01:50:44,000 --> 01:50:45,700
In the name
of the Federation--

1455
01:50:45,800 --> 01:50:47,800
Any idea when you'll
get to the point?

1456
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:55,000
A ball of fire 1,200 miles in diameter
heading straight for earth...

1457
01:50:55,200 --> 01:50:58,500
and we have no idea how to stop it.
That's the problem.

1458
01:51:01,900 --> 01:51:03,400
How much time do we have?

1459
01:51:04,400 --> 01:51:07,900
If its speed remains constant,
in an hour and 57 minutes.

1460
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,000
I'll call you back
in two hours.

1461
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:12,300
Hello?

1462
01:52:23,700 --> 01:52:25,700
They just landed
in the desert.

1463
01:52:28,000 --> 01:52:29,700
Good job, David.

1464
01:52:31,300 --> 01:52:33,600
- Put her in the center.
- Where? Here?

1465
01:52:41,300 --> 01:52:43,100
You got it figured out, Father?

1466
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,800
This one should be fire.

1467
01:52:46,100 --> 01:52:48,200
- You know how this works?
- Theoretically.

1468
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:51,600
The four stones
should go around.

1469
01:52:51,700 --> 01:52:53,800
The Fifth Element should be
in the middle...

1470
01:52:53,900 --> 01:52:56,800
and then the weapon
against evil should work.

1471
01:52:57,400 --> 01:52:59,500
You've never seen this work?

1472
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:00,700
Give me that.

1473
01:53:00,900 --> 01:53:04,400
Every weapon has a manual.
I'm sure this has one too.

1474
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:13,900
That's it.
That's it.

1475
01:53:14,100 --> 01:53:15,500
Match up the symbols.
Go! Go!

1476
01:53:17,100 --> 01:53:18,200
Wind.

1477
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:22,100
My man, what you doing?

1478
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,200
- What?
- What you doing?

1479
01:53:25,400 --> 01:53:27,200
Trying to keep you
in the D.J. business.

1480
01:53:31,000 --> 01:53:31,900
Fire.

1481
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:34,600
Done.

1482
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:35,800
What happens?

1483
01:53:36,000 --> 01:53:38,600
So, now,
we have to open them.

1484
01:53:39,700 --> 01:53:41,700
And you know how to do that.
Right?

1485
01:53:41,700 --> 01:53:43,100
Theoretically...

1486
01:53:44,800 --> 01:53:45,900
No.

1487
01:53:50,700 --> 01:53:52,400
Leeloo, honey, wake up.

1488
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:53,800
You have to help us.

1489
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,500
How do you open the stones?

1490
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,600
Wind blows.

1491
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:02,700
Fire burns.

1492
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:06,300
Yes, I know all that.
But how do you open these stones?

1493
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:07,800
Rain...

1494
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:12,700
falls.

1495
01:54:19,200 --> 01:54:20,500
What does it mean?

1496
01:54:22,300 --> 01:54:23,700
I think that--

1497
01:54:23,800 --> 01:54:25,000
Maybe it's a charade.

1498
01:54:25,300 --> 01:54:26,700
A game or something.

1499
01:54:27,100 --> 01:54:29,600
If we don't get these stones open
in five minutes, we're dead.

1500
01:54:29,600 --> 01:54:31,300
- Dead?
- Yes, dead.

1501
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:45,300
Too late.

1502
01:54:47,000 --> 01:54:48,700
We've lost contact with them.

1503
01:54:48,900 --> 01:54:50,200
Three minutes.

1504
01:54:51,700 --> 01:54:53,000
I think mine is broken.

1505
01:54:53,100 --> 01:54:54,700
Why I gotta get
the broke one?

1506
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:04,900
We're never gonna make it.

1507
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:12,400
It moved.

1508
01:55:13,600 --> 01:55:16,000
- Show me what you did.
- Nothing.

1509
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,700
Shut up, shut up!

1510
01:55:17,900 --> 01:55:20,900
Show me what you did,
step-by-step.

1511
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:23,300
- I was standing here.
- Quickly.

1512
01:55:23,400 --> 01:55:27,700
I put my hands on the top
like this, and I said...

1513
01:55:28,700 --> 01:55:30,200
"We're not going to make it."

1514
01:55:32,200 --> 01:55:33,500
And that's it?

1515
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:43,600
Korben, my man.

1516
01:55:44,300 --> 01:55:45,200
Wind.

1517
01:55:46,200 --> 01:55:48,400
She said, "Wind blows."

1518
01:55:56,400 --> 01:55:57,900
Everyone take a stone.

1519
01:55:58,200 --> 01:56:01,100
Water for water. Fire for fire.
Earth for Earth. Go!

1520
01:56:03,500 --> 01:56:04,700
Earth.

1521
01:56:04,900 --> 01:56:06,400
Open the other one.

1522
01:56:22,300 --> 01:56:24,700
Korben, my man,
I have no fire.

1523
01:56:24,900 --> 01:56:27,100
I have no matches.
Do you have any?

1524
01:56:27,200 --> 01:56:29,600
I stopped smoking.
Father, you smoke?

1525
01:56:29,800 --> 01:56:32,500
Got some matches?
We need some fire.

1526
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:35,500
We're going to die.

1527
01:56:42,700 --> 01:56:44,100
Don't breathe.

1528
01:57:03,500 --> 01:57:04,500
Fire.

1529
01:57:05,300 --> 01:57:06,300
One minute.

1530
01:57:06,400 --> 01:57:08,100
Let's go, Leeloo.

1531
01:57:08,200 --> 01:57:11,300
Wake up. Wake up.
It's time for you to work now.

1532
01:57:12,000 --> 01:57:13,500
Protect life...

1533
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:16,000
until death.

1534
01:57:16,200 --> 01:57:17,300
Listen to me!

1535
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:19,000
Listen to me.

1536
01:57:19,200 --> 01:57:21,800
Listen,
I know you're very tired.

1537
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:25,700
I'll take you on vacation.
A real vacation, just you and me.

1538
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:27,600
But if you don't
do something right now...

1539
01:57:27,800 --> 01:57:29,300
we'll all die.

1540
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:33,200
What's the use of saving life
when you see what you do with it?

1541
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:36,200
It'll enter the atmosphere
in 40 seconds.

1542
01:57:37,600 --> 01:57:39,200
You're right.
You're right.

1543
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:41,500
There are some things...

1544
01:57:41,700 --> 01:57:44,000
very nice things worth saving;
beautiful things.

1545
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:46,300
Beautiful things.

1546
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:48,900
Like love?

1547
01:57:49,000 --> 01:57:51,100
Yes, love.
That's good. That's good.

1548
01:57:51,100 --> 01:57:53,500
That's a good example.
Love is worth saving.

1549
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:56,200
I don't know love.

1550
01:57:58,300 --> 01:57:59,600
I don't know love.

1551
01:57:59,800 --> 01:58:02,100
I was built to protect,
not love.

1552
01:58:02,300 --> 01:58:05,100
So there's no use for me
other than this.

1553
01:58:05,300 --> 01:58:07,300
You're wrong.
You're wrong. You're wrong.

1554
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:09,600
I need you.

1555
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:11,400
I need you,
very much.

1556
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,300
Why?

1557
01:58:16,300 --> 01:58:17,600
Because...

1558
01:58:17,900 --> 01:58:19,300
because...

1559
01:58:20,100 --> 01:58:22,300
Tell her, Korben.

1560
01:58:24,100 --> 01:58:25,600
Tell me.

1561
01:58:25,800 --> 01:58:26,800
Please.

1562
01:58:26,900 --> 01:58:28,800
Why you need me?

1563
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:30,800
Because...

1564
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:32,500
Tell me.

1565
01:58:34,600 --> 01:58:36,100
- Tell me.
- Because I--

1566
01:58:36,300 --> 01:58:37,800
Because I love you.

1567
01:58:39,000 --> 01:58:40,400
I love you.

1568
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:45,200
10...

1569
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:46,300
9...

1570
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:47,500
8...

1571
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:48,500
7...

1572
01:58:48,900 --> 01:58:50,300
6, 5...

1573
01:58:50,700 --> 01:58:52,500
4, 3...

1574
01:58:52,900 --> 01:58:53,900
2...

1575
01:58:54,200 --> 01:58:55,200
1.

1576
01:59:33,200 --> 01:59:37,400
Scanner imaging has confirmed
the dark planet dead.

1577
01:59:38,100 --> 01:59:40,900
The planet seems to have stopped
at 62 miles from impact.

1578
01:59:53,700 --> 01:59:55,900
What's wrong?
What you screaming for?

1579
01:59:56,100 --> 01:59:58,600
Every five minutes
it's a bomb or something.

1580
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:00,100
I'm leaving.

1581
02:00:14,700 --> 02:00:16,000
Mr. President.

1582
02:00:16,100 --> 02:00:18,900
Let me introduce Professor Mactilburgh
who runs the center.

1583
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:20,900
It's an honor, Mr. President.

1584
02:00:20,900 --> 02:00:22,700
Where are my two heroes?

1585
02:00:22,800 --> 02:00:26,600
They were so tired from their ordeal,
we put them in the reactor.

1586
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:28,700
I have 19 meetings after this.

1587
02:00:28,900 --> 02:00:31,300
Let me see
if they're revived.

1588
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:32,500
Thank you.

1589
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:35,100
We go live in one minute.

1590
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,300
They're...

1591
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,200
not ready.

1592
02:00:48,200 --> 02:00:49,300
They need...

1593
02:00:49,500 --> 02:00:50,700
five more minutes.

1594
02:00:50,900 --> 02:00:52,200
You have 20 seconds.

1595
02:00:52,400 --> 02:00:54,600
No, ma'am, I tried.
No, ma'am.

1596
02:00:54,700 --> 02:00:55,700
Who's that?

1597
02:00:55,900 --> 02:00:57,600
Some woman.
Claims to be Korben's mother.

1598
02:00:57,700 --> 02:00:58,900
Give it here.

1599
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:02,700
Mrs. Dallas,
this is the President.

1600
02:01:02,900 --> 02:01:04,700
On behalf
of the Federation--

1601
02:01:04,900 --> 02:01:06,700
That doesn't
even sound like him.

1602
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:09,300
The President's an idiot.
You don't sound like an idiot.

1603
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,000
If you don't want to talk
to your mother...

1604
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:12,700
just avoid me as usual.

1605
02:01:12,900 --> 02:01:16,600
I'll throw myself in traffic.
I'll Saran Wrap myself to the bed.
