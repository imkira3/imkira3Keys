2
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,204
<i>The world we live in.</i>

3
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:33,201
<i>It's so wondrous, mysterious,</i>

4
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:35,995
<i>even magical.</i>

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,085
<i>No. No, not that world.</i>

6
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,917
<i>I meant this one.</i>

7
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,798
<i>The smartphone.</i>

8
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:49,099
<i>Each system and program and app is its
own little planet of perfect technology,</i>

9
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:54,597
<i>all providing services so necessary,</i>
<i>so crucial, so unbelievably profound.</i>

10
00:00:55,514 --> 00:00:57,266
Look who just sent me a text.

11
00:00:57,349 --> 00:00:58,350
Addie McAllister?

12
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,145
Must be a mistake. Or a joke. Or a scam.

13
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,650
Don't send her your Social Security number.

14
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,863
Dude.

15
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:05,736
She's right there.

16
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,989
<i>That's our user, Alex.</i>

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:10,112
<i>And, like every freshman in high school,</i>

18
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:14,291
<i>his whole life, everything,</i>
<i>revolves around his phone.</i>

19
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,920
<i>And, as the pace of life</i>
<i>gets faster and faster...</i>

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,627
Phones down in five.

21
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,088
<i>And attention spans</i>
<i>get shorter and shorter and...</i>

22
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:29,173
<i>You're probably not even</i>
<i>listening to me right now.</i>

23
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,681
<i>Who has the time to type out actual words?</i>

24
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,723
<i>And that's where we come in,</i>

25
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:37,682
<i>the most important invention</i>
<i>in the history of communication...</i>

26
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:42,561
<i>Emojis.</i>

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,738
<i>That's my home.</i>

28
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:46,732
<i>Textopolis.</i>

29
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,407
<i>Here, each of us does one thing,</i>

30
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,872
<i>and we have to nail it every time.</i>

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:57,876
<i>The Christmas Tree</i>
<i>just has to stand there all festive.</i>

32
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,287
Merry Christmas.

33
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,121
It's still September, Tim.

34
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,043
- <i>The Princesses...</i>
- I am so pretty.

35
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:05,626
<i>They just got to wear their crowns</i>
<i>and keep their hair combed.</i>

36
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:07,211
You guys, we are so pretty.

37
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,385
<i>Devil, Poop, Thumbs Up.</i>

38
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:13,183
<i>They just show up, and they're good to go.</i>

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,804
<i>But for the faces, the pressure is on.</i>

40
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:19,726
<i>Crier always has to cry,</i>
<i>even if he's just won the lottery.</i>

41
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,479
Hooray! I'm a billionaire!

42
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,273
<i>The Laugher is always laughing,</i>

43
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:26,105
<i>even if he's just broken his arm.</i>

44
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,357
I can see the bone!

45
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,653
<i>Now, me, I'm a Meh.</i>

46
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:36,702
<i>So I got to be totally over it all the time,</i>
<i>you know, like, "Meh, who cares?"</i>

47
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:38,659
<i>Which is not as easy as it sounds.</i>

48
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,038
<i>I gotta be</i>

49
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,495
<i>Meh</i>

50
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:43,080
<i>I gotta be</i>

51
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,582
<i>Meh</i>

52
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:55,263
Morning, Mrs. D.
I see you have the little minis with you.

53
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,970
They're so cute.

54
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,694
That is so adorable, I can't take it!

55
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:14,907
Now I'll never get them to sleep.

56
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,780
Stick to your one face, weirdo.

57
00:03:18,532 --> 00:03:19,953
No! No!

58
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,582
<i>It's hard to always act blasé,</i>

59
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:25,834
<i>when living in Textopolis
is just so exciting.</i>

60
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:27,377
Hello, good simians.

61
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:29,710
Those are some sharp attachés.

62
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:32,008
Yes, well, we have business to attend to.

63
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,632
- What kind of business?
- Monkey business.

64
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,723
I sounded British.

65
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:41,646
Meh. That was really good.

66
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:45,187
Meh. Meh. That was a great...

67
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,938
- Whatcha doing there, mate?
- Practicing.

68
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,895
Today is my first day on the phone.

69
00:03:48,979 --> 00:03:51,357
Boy. I'm gonna be so meh.

70
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,067
What are you gonna do?

71
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:55,904
Me and the boys
are gonna throw ourselves on the barbie!

72
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:57,658
Here's my sauce now.

73
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,036
G'day, mate.

74
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,495
Hey<i>. Konnichiwa.</i>

75
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,463
Sorry, emoticons.

76
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,175
I hate knocking over the elderly.
Here, let me help, let me help.

77
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,173
My colon!

78
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,925
- Is that the time?
- Hey, my eyes are up here, pal.

79
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah! All right!

80
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,815
Right on time.

81
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:40,163
So, last week,
Alex sends me next to this guy.

82
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,368
That kid. Where does he get this stuff?

83
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,375
Why are you laughing, freak?

84
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,631
<i>Now, unlike me, my parents are total pros.</i>

85
00:04:58,089 --> 00:05:00,683
Gene, please tell me
you weren't laughing just now.

86
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:02,098
In public.

87
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,768
He was. I remember.

88
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,145
Let's go somewhere more private.

89
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,942
I have some bad news, Gene.

90
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,652
And I'm afraid you'll have
the wrong reaction.

91
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,235
Okay. What's the wrong reaction?

92
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,696
Anything other than "meh."

93
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,744
Come on. I don't want to be late.

94
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,617
I'm not letting you go to work today.

95
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,953
- Wait, what?
- You're just not ready, son.

96
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,415
Come on! Working in the cube
is an emoji's whole purpose in life.

97
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,921
Everybody my age is working
on the phone except for me.

98
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:37,130
Sweetie, that's not true.

99
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:41,678
Yeah! I'm gonna work on the phone,
and I'm only 10.

100
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,102
That's because I believe in you.

101
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:45,933
Should we wash our hands?

102
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,562
No, no, no.

103
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:54,651
We're number two! We're number two!
We're number two!

104
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,690
See?

105
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,902
I know I'm different, okay?

106
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,032
But when I need to, I can be meh.

107
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,200
I just...

108
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,752
I want to be a working emoji,
you know, like...

109
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:10,792
Like everybody else, and then...

110
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,005
Then I would finally fit in, you know?

111
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:15,088
You fit in, honey.

112
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,002
No, I don't, Mom.

113
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,632
I never have.

114
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:21,885
But I can change all that if you'd
just let me. Just give me a chance.

115
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,390
But what if you get sent out on the phone,
making the wrong face?

116
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,395
No, Dad, I'll make the right face.

117
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:28,973
Look.

118
00:06:29,264 --> 00:06:31,141
Meh...

119
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,561
You're so handsome when you make that face.

120
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,357
I think he's ready, Mel.

121
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,526
Meh.

122
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,658
Come on, Dad.

123
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,619
Let me prove it to you.

124
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:45,408
If you really think you're ready.

125
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,163
I am! Yes! Yes.
I promise, I won't let you down.

126
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,378
Stop.

127
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,804
Congratulations, everyone!

128
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:08,729
What an exciting day for all of you.

129
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,227
It's really her. Pizza.

130
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,653
- Hey.
- Your first day on the job.

131
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,321
Hi. Hi.

132
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:21,867
Don't be nervous.
I won't bite. Hi. I'm Smiler.

133
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,613
Don't touch me.

134
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:24,739
- Hi!
- Okay.

135
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,196
I mean, hey.

136
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,744
As you know, I'm Smiler.

137
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:32,163
I am the system supervisor here

138
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,621
because I was the original emoji.

139
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,047
Here's how it works.

140
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,345
It's nothing fancy.

141
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,882
Wait a minute. It's really fancy.

142
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:53,766
You each have your own cube on the emoji bar.

143
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,725
If Alex chooses you,

144
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:59,029
should you be so lucky,
your cube will light up.

145
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,323
It's showtime.

146
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,406
The scanner will scan you,

147
00:08:07,237 --> 00:08:11,959
and that scan will get sent
right up to Alex's text box.

148
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,710
And let me tell you, guys,

149
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:18,298
there is nothing like getting scanned
for the first time.

150
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,052
You're gonna love it. Really.

151
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:25,634
Now, over here is the favorites section

152
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:29,389
where you'll find
all the most popular emojis.

153
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:32,721
And, of course, you'll find my cube here.

154
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,892
You are smooth.

155
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,394
Just doing my duty.

156
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,896
What? What did I say?

157
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,735
Rocket looking to party.

158
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:47,364
Come on, tell me you aren't
just a little bit tempted.

159
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,118
Steven, for the last time,
I don't want to buy a time-share.

160
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:54,118
Come on, man, it's Hi-5.
You know me, I'm a favorite.

161
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:55,661
Alex hasn't picked you in weeks.

162
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,083
And if he stops picking you,
you're no longer a favorite.

163
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,665
It's got to be some sort of mistake.

164
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:03,048
I mean, look at me, I'm an attractive hand
giving a high five.

165
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,466
- Fist Bump. Come on in.
- Hey.

166
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,219
- Ladies.
- Fist Bump? He's a knucklehead. Literally.

167
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,176
Look at him. I can look like that.

168
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:13,891
Cramp. Huge mistake.

169
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:18,354
Help. Help me. Help up the hand.

170
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,902
- There you go.
- Thanks, mate.

171
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:24,402
Hey, little Meh, how about
you create a distraction,

172
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,237
and then I'll just slip under the rope?

173
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,701
Is someone lost?

174
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,824
Smiler, hi. Just leaving.

175
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:33,077
Yeah, you know, just killing time

176
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,742
before I go back to my cube in the far corner

177
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,499
where Alex can't even see me anymore!

178
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,664
You may not be a favorite anymore,

179
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,675
but you will always have a place in the cube.

180
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:45,339
Yeah, in the nosebleeds.

181
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,843
I'm standing right here. Words hurt.

182
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:53,181
The most important thing
I can tell you is to just be yourself.

183
00:09:54,886 --> 00:09:58,516
I was made to be happy,
so I am always smiling.

184
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:01,730
<i>Places, please. Emojis to your cubes.</i>

185
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,605
<i>Attention. We've got incoming.</i>

186
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,982
Got to be meh. Got to be meh.

187
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,863
Oh, my gosh, my own cube.

188
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,912
I can't believe it.
I could put a plant over here.

189
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,578
And over here could go
an inspirational calendar.

190
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,452
Okay. Got to be meh. Got to be meh.

191
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:20,378
Look at our son down there.

192
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,047
I'm just beaming

193
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,550
with pride.

194
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,676
You don't think he'll actually get picked,
do you?

195
00:10:32,215 --> 00:10:34,058
Hie-ro-gly-phics.

196
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:37,562
Hieroglyphics was an ancient language
of picture forms.

197
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,935
Does that remind anyone of anything?

198
00:10:40,849 --> 00:10:45,104
Hello? A language of pictures. Anyone?

199
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:50,530
Early hieroglyphs date back
as far as 3,300...

200
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,490
I got to reply to Addie's text.

201
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,571
- What should I write?
- Nothing.

202
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:56,661
- Nothing?
- Words aren't cool.

203
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,744
Okay. Be cool. Be cool.

204
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,378
All right,
Alex is not sure how he wants to play this.

205
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,922
I would really love it to be me.

206
00:11:08,251 --> 00:11:09,844
Beam me up! Beam me up!

207
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,763
I need Thumbs Up on standby.

208
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,549
Yeah! Thumbs Up is going in!

209
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,269
<i>Wait! Alex is changing his mind.</i>

210
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:21,893
He's moving.

211
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,979
Okay. Looks like it's gonna be Meh.

212
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:34,119
I'm so nervous, I could almost shrug.

213
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,950
We are go for Meh.

214
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,407
Initiating scan.

215
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,700
Okay. You can do this.

216
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,628
- I can't do this! I can't do it!
- What is this?

217
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,674
- Stop the scan!
- I can't! It's too late!

218
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,591
Meh, meh, meh, meh.
My goodness, I'm freaking out!

219
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,095
- What's he doing?
- He's making the wrong face!

220
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,935
Good for him! Little... Wait, what?

221
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,061
Be meh! Be meh! Be meh!

222
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,605
Abort! Abort!

223
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,399
Shut it down! Shut it down!

224
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:14,902
What is that emoji?

225
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,612
Wrong emoji sent! Evacuate the Meh cube!

226
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,577
- <i>Evacuate the cube!</i>
- I got to get out of here.

227
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,793
<i>Get that bozo out of there!</i>

228
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,250
I'm trying!

229
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:45,690
No!

230
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:47,608
Oh, my God.

231
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:56,576
The humanity.

232
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,116
Medic.

233
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,660
Sorry, everybody.
That was not what I meant to do.

234
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,039
I kinda...

235
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,579
I kinda panicked.

236
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:09,710
Are you even a Meh at all?

237
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,917
- Who? Me?
- Course he is.

238
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,418
He's my spitting image.

239
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,924
If you have expressions other than meh,

240
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,015
what you are is a malfunction.

241
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,100
Malfunction?

242
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,396
No! I can be meh.
Just give me one more chance.

243
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,438
That's not gonna happen.

244
00:13:33,021 --> 00:13:36,196
You know what would be really fun?
A board meeting.

245
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,572
Where we could figure out
what to do with you!

246
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,368
- I knew there was something wrong with him.
- A malfunction?

247
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,581
- What's gonna happen to him?
- He can't work on the phone.

248
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,913
What would Alex think?

249
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,964
- That's the guy.
- What do his parents think?

250
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,813
I just wanted to be useful, you know? Fit in.

251
00:14:11,601 --> 00:14:14,320
Now everybody thinks I'm a malfunction.

252
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,568
I am a malfunction.

253
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,955
Even if you are a malfunction, Gene,

254
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,916
your mom and dad still love you.

255
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,830
I knew you weren't ready.

256
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,371
Let's get you out of here and take you home.

257
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,965
One day, all this will blow over,

258
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:37,711
and everyone will almost forget
about what you did.

259
00:14:38,628 --> 00:14:39,674
Until then,

260
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:42,257
you should probably stay
locked up in the apartment.

261
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,309
Wait. You want to hide me away?

262
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,557
You're embarrassed of me.

263
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,559
It's for your own safety.

264
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,733
We're trying to protect you, son.

265
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,154
Gene? Where are you going?

266
00:14:56,604 --> 00:14:57,856
I'm not gonna run away from this.

267
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:01,660
I'm an emoji, and even though
I'm not sure exactly which one,

268
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,489
I've got to have some sort of purpose here.

269
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,032
I know it.

270
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,954
Gene, no.

271
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,328
Sweetie, please.

272
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,292
Boy.

273
00:15:18,376 --> 00:15:20,173
- A malfunction...
- Order! Order!

274
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:21,800
The motion is carried.

275
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,966
So, how'd it go, Gavel?

276
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,220
Hey, Light Bulb,
tell me what's going on in there.

277
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,435
What? Poop, what is it?

278
00:15:31,681 --> 00:15:33,770
Tell me, turd. Tell me true. What happened?

279
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,690
I know it was an accident.
We all have accidents.

280
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,317
You're so soft, Poop.

281
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,024
Not too soft, I hope.

282
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,195
Gene!
We were just gonna come looking for you.

283
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:50,701
Why don't you come inside the boardroom,
and we can have a teeny, weeny chat.

284
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:04,431
I came up here to defend myself,
but you seem pretty happy.

285
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,974
So, good news?

286
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,265
Right. I'm always happy.

287
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,479
Right. Hashtag truth.

288
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,851
Well, the only thing
that could ever make me unhappy

289
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,149
is if one of our emoji team made a mistake,

290
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:23,366
which caused Alex to lose faith in the phone.

291
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,829
And then our whole world gets wiped out.

292
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:33,584
Smiler, I double-pinky-swear promise to you

293
00:16:33,868 --> 00:16:37,122
that I will never, ever
make a mistake in the cube again.

294
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:41,543
We know you won't, Gene. We know you won't.

295
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:47,677
You know, the first time you said it,
it sounded genuine, but then you repeated it,

296
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:49,178
and then, that was weird.

297
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,479
That's because we're setting you up
with our best Anti-Virus Bots.

298
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,569
So, they'll like... They'll just...
They're gonna fix me?

299
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:02,485
Actually, delete you. But yes!

300
00:17:02,897 --> 00:17:04,820
- Wait, what?
- If you get deleted,

301
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,030
you don't have to worry about

302
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,784
what your purpose is or the future

303
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,491
or why you're such a malfunction.

304
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,873
'Cause you're deleted, right?

305
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,378
All right, good talk.

306
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,789
Bots!

307
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,297
No!

308
00:17:27,797 --> 00:17:29,219
Don't let him escape!

309
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:46,361
Party time! Wait a minute...

310
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,709
The air is better here.

311
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,056
- Beer, Tea.
- I'm Coffee!

312
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,512
Sorry. Sheesh. So edgy.

313
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,313
My old cube.

314
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:23,978
Take a hike, Mike.

315
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:27,276
My name's not Mike. What?

316
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,278
- There's AV Bots coming!
- For me?

317
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:31,031
Just because I'm in the wrong section?

318
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,623
Holy deleto!

319
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:44,169
- What do we do?
- Quick! This way!

320
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:50,547
Let's go.

321
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,018
Don't tell anyone you're about to see this.

322
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:03,230
They'll never find us down here.

323
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,562
Where are we? The basement?

324
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:09,152
No. Welcome to the Loser Lounge,

325
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,990
where the emojis who never get used hang out.

326
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,574
Go fish, Fish Cake With Swirl.

327
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,921
Sweep so you won't cry.
Sweep so you won't cry.

328
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:25,460
Sweep so you won't cry.

329
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,336
I almost got deleted.

330
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,380
Me, Hi-5.

331
00:19:32,463 --> 00:19:34,136
Hey. What's up, Hi-5?

332
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:37,469
They weren't trying to delete you.
They were trying to delete me.

333
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,355
You? What's so important about you
they'd send out an entire team of Bots?

334
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:43,607
They say I'm a malfunction.

335
00:19:43,766 --> 00:19:44,984
What?

336
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,405
You bringing malfunctions in here now, Hi-5?

337
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,779
For crying out loud, Abandoned Luggage,

338
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,449
that had better not be
my leftover Chinese food.

339
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,781
What Chinese food?

340
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,667
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be living large, hashtag blessed,

341
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,836
the favorite of the favorites,
and then demoted to this pit of despair?

342
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:13,384
Here, will you hit my calluses for me?

343
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,301
At least you're a working emoji.

344
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:17,261
That's all I ever wanted.

345
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:19,305
Well, if that's all it'll take

346
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:22,764
for you to be satisfied, then just find
a hacker and get reprogrammed.

347
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,140
It's not that complicated.

348
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:25,691
Where would I find a hacker?

349
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,318
In the Piracy app.

350
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,857
Who took my clear nail polish?

351
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,649
Piracy app?

352
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,487
To get there, I mean,
I'd have to leave Textopolis.

353
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:38,830
So? I've done it. Would you be a brother?

354
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,242
One of the Princess emojis
left the phone altogether.

355
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,667
Now she lives on the cloud.

356
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,337
That is good.

357
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:49,458
I'm sure the hacker that helped her do that
could easily reprogram you.

358
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,417
- The name's Jailbreak.
- Jailbreak?

359
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,006
That's great! Reprogrammed.

360
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,424
I just need to be reprogrammed,

361
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,974
and then, I can finally be
the Meh I was meh to be.

362
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,514
Help me find that hacker, Hi-5.
Will you? Please?

363
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,687
Maybe this hacker could help you, too.

364
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:07,438
Like rewrite some code,
get you into the favorites section.

365
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,815
Wait a minute.

366
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,979
I've been trying to use my charisma

367
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,360
and sense of entitlement
to get me back on top,

368
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,903
but all I need is a hacker.

369
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,611
Today's your lucky day. Let's roll.

370
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,075
Hey, can I come, too?

371
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,907
Talk to the hand, Red Wagon.

372
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,702
I thought I was.

373
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,504
Bye, Felicia.

374
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,420
Ciao, Fish Cake with Swirl.

375
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,841
Daddy's heading back
to the VIPs where he belongs!

376
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:38,594
Wait. What about the Bots?

377
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,509
Good point. Good point.

378
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:00,949
Hey.

379
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:02,413
I shouldn't have picked the cactus.

380
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,409
- I just... I shouldn't have picked it.
- You didn't even try to get the tree.

381
00:22:05,491 --> 00:22:07,118
It's baffling. Let's go.

382
00:22:13,666 --> 00:22:14,884
Hi-5?

383
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,340
Hello?

384
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,306
Hi-5?

385
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:24,222
- Where are you?
- I'm right here!

386
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,976
Gene! Here we are, end of the text app.

387
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,027
No way.

388
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,563
Come on, Gene. It's perfectly safe.

389
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:37,359
- No!
- Gene, help me!

390
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,528
- The wallpaper monster's got me!
- No! Hold on, hold on!

391
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,821
Hi-5!

392
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,531
No. This is all my fault! I'm so sorry, Hi-5!
I'm...

393
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,331
I'm just messing with you.

394
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:48,367
It's one of those
rubber finger-monster puppets

395
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,919
from the '80s. I collected the whole set.

396
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,459
All right, you coming?

397
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:54,752
- What do I do?
- What do you mean?

398
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,550
Just take a step through the other side.

399
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:01,050
This is it.

400
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:02,973
The next time I come back here,

401
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,642
I'll be a real Meh.

402
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:10,855
Hi-5?

403
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,326
No!

404
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,291
Are you finished?

405
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,454
Where are we?

406
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,541
Welcome to the Wallpaper.

407
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,683
This place is incredible.

408
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,062
Each app is its own unique world.

409
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,894
That's my face. You're on my... Thank you.

410
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,820
What is this place?

411
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:00,197
WeChat.

412
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:07,030
It's like a whole other world.

413
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,990
It is.

414
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:15,082
What are they?

415
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,382
They're Bubble Pups. They might be cute,
but, man, are they clingy.

416
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,677
- Bubble Pups?
- They're stickers, Gene.

417
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,387
Try to get with the program.

418
00:24:24,046 --> 00:24:25,468
This is so cool.

419
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,387
Wait. What's in that one?

420
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,515
- Guys, look at this picture. Look at my baby.
- This is what I ate for breakfast.

421
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,017
- This is what I ate for lunch!
- Here's me on a hike!

422
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,599
Here's me in the gym!
Here's me in the bathroom!

423
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:36,776
Everybody's talking about themselves.

424
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,522
How does he know so many people?

425
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,481
None of these people know him,
but they like him,

426
00:24:41,563 --> 00:24:44,533
and that's what matters
in this life, popularity.

427
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,577
I think I'd...

428
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:49,698
I think I'd rather just have a real friend.

429
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,249
A real friend?
How's that gonna get you anywhere?

430
00:24:52,408 --> 00:24:54,581
What you need are fans.

431
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:58,289
They give you complete
and unrelenting support.

432
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,249
As long as you're on top.

433
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,633
Poor Gene. I blame myself.

434
00:25:04,795 --> 00:25:06,422
I blame you, too.

435
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,595
I just wanted to be supportive.

436
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,476
You just wanted a vacation.

437
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:14,806
You take that back, Mel Meh.

438
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,480
Bots.

439
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:22,855
If they haven't found Gene by now,
he must have skipped town.

440
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,315
You mean the Wallpaper?

441
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,033
Our boy's on the run.

442
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,943
How about we find him ourselves?

443
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:29,740
Yeah, for sure.

444
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,372
Tell all Bots to follow those Mehs.

445
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:43,879
I'm sure they'll know all the
freaky-deaky apps Gene will hide out in.

446
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,506
I'm really good at making plans, you guys.

447
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,175
Right?

448
00:25:48,422 --> 00:25:50,550
Here we are. The Piracy app.

449
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,767
This is where we'll find Jailbreak.

450
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,729
But this is the Dictionary.

451
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,190
That's just what Alex
wants his parents to think.

452
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,900
This is called a skin.

453
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:03,942
Really? What could a teenage boy
possibly want to hide from his parents?

454
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:08,325
Just try to keep up.
This place can get a little rough.

455
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,911
Ahoy, mateys.

456
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,788
Look who's back!

457
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,210
Hi-5!

458
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,667
I'm a bit of a celebrity here.
Always welcome.

459
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,297
Loser!

460
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,132
Come on. Follow me.

461
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,512
Great. Emojis.

462
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:39,272
I thought the conversation just got dumber.

463
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,563
Internet trolls. Just ignore them.

464
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,522
Eventually, they'll get a job or a girlfriend

465
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,356
or some sort of purpose in life,
and they'll stop.

466
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,618
Virus. We'll just...
We'll just walk over this way.

467
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:59,577
- Hi! It's so great to see you again.
- Do I know you?

468
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,958
It's Spam. Just sign here and I can get you
special discounts on vitamins

469
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:04,710
and credit card offers
that can save you up to 25%.

470
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,463
- 25%?
- No, no, no, don't get sucked in.

471
00:27:07,543 --> 00:27:08,839
Back off, Spam!

472
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,632
It's the only way to deal... Back off!

473
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,176
Thank you very much!

474
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:15,135
You can illegally download our CD right here.

475
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,561
Hey, Trojan Horse. How are you?

476
00:27:17,803 --> 00:27:19,349
Yeah, what'll it be, hand?

477
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,729
I'll have a bottle of "Hack Daniel's."

478
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,567
Maybe with a plate of cheese and hackers?

479
00:27:28,397 --> 00:27:30,491
- <i>Capisce?</i>
- You trying to find a hacker?

480
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:33,403
- You can just ask, you know.
- Sorry. Yes.

481
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,283
We're looking for a hacker named Jailbreak.

482
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,406
I know a guy that can hook you up.

483
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,252
Right over there.

484
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,710
He looks capable.

485
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,834
No, not him. Her.

486
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:50,924
Wait. He's a she?

487
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,343
Hey, Jailbreak.

488
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,345
- Mind if we join you?
- Yes.

489
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,763
That's the thing about
the Internet, isn't it?

490
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,267
You can never tell if someone's
being ironic or sincere.

491
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:03,353
I sincerely, unironically
want you to go away.

492
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:07,357
That's a good one.

493
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,110
So, here's the thing.
My friend Gene here has a little problem.

494
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,693
Well, see, I'm supposed to be a Meh,

495
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,572
- but I don't really feel...
- Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

496
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:18,656
No, that's good. And we thought
you could help, since you got the Princess,

497
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:20,787
- you know, off the phone.
- Not interested.

498
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,836
Hold up. That's not a Meh face.

499
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,591
Bots! They're after me!

500
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:38,387
How are you doing that?

501
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,595
Look, it's just something I can do.
Can you help us?

502
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:44,973
Follow me.

503
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,396
Bots! Delete my history!

504
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,742
I corrupted the entire hard drive.

505
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,284
I made the most delicious cinnamon buns.

506
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,293
Maybe if there was something
to, you know, jog my memory.

507
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,924
Come on! Move!

508
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:15,387
Hey, Trolls, why is that mailbox
wearing a tuxedo?

509
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,059
Hi! It's so great to see you again! Call me!

510
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,067
This tunnel will get us out of here.

511
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,280
Move!

512
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,637
Did that cloud taste sweet to you?

513
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,224
Help me! Help! I'm stuck!

514
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:12,394
- Sweet motherboard!
- Where am I?

515
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,317
- Get me out of here.
- Hey, Palm Face.

516
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:20,949
- Try getting him out the top!
- Already on it!

517
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,446
Hold tight, Gene.

518
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,876
This feels very odd, and it smells.

519
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,460
I mean, it smells good, it smells delicious,
but I still don't like it.

520
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,840
The game obviously thinks you're a candy,

521
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,095
even though you're weirdly misshapen,
you know?

522
00:30:42,466 --> 00:30:43,763
What are we gonna do?

523
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,514
Stay very still.

524
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:49,144
Don't worry. We've got your back.
Right, Hi-5?

525
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,521
Hey, Fingers! You want to focus?

526
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,773
For your information, I happen
to have a sugar addiction,

527
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,322
- and it's a very serious...
- Listen, Finger Head!

528
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:01,154
We have to get Gene out of the game
without blowing him up.

529
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,197
I don't want to blow up.

530
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,575
We have to match up the candies,
so that Gene will drop to the bottom.

531
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,704
And we can't match him
with any yellows, or else...

532
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,290
Don't do that. Please don't do that.

533
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:12,625
Watch.

534
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,129
- You got it?
- Match three in a row.

535
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,630
Don't blow Gene up. Got it.

536
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,462
And we have to be very careful.

537
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:23,048
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Careful. Candy!

538
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:27,018
- Watch it!
- Hey!

539
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,141
No! No, no, no! Slow down.

540
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,014
Not the yellows! Not the yellows.

541
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,811
I said careful!

542
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:43,449
My mom just joined Facebook.
Can you believe she wanted to friend me?

543
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:48,327
Hey, Addie, I was
just wondering if you are...

544
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,625
- <i>Tasty.</i>
- What?

545
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:52,039
- <i>Delicious.</i>
- Excuse me?

546
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,120
<i>Sweet.</i>

547
00:31:53,203 --> 00:31:54,705
- Hey, Addie!
- Hi, Nikki.

548
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,753
- No!
- See you later, Alex.

549
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,751
<i>Sugar Crush.</i>

550
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,381
So over this.

551
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,596
<i>Wireless Wireless. How may I help you?</i>

552
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,178
I'd like to make an appointment.

553
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,013
It's like this phone
is playing games with me.

554
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,517
Hey, what does this do?

555
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,315
No!

556
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,359
Get me out of here!

557
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:31,409
- Suck it in!
- No! Stop it! Stop, stop!

558
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:35,003
- It's not working.
- Well, there's one option left.

559
00:32:35,579 --> 00:32:37,081
We line you up with the yellows.

560
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,590
But you said not to do that.

561
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,046
Special candies get transported to that jar.

562
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,595
The game might think you're a special candy.

563
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:47,224
And what if it doesn't think
I'm a special candy?

564
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,592
Well...

565
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,946
- Jailbreak, hello? Hello, Jailbreak?
- Sorry.

566
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:04,073
What if it doesn't think I'm a special candy?

567
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,651
I'm not too worried about it.

568
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:10,489
Okay, just do it.

569
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,372
Gene!

570
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:22,585
- Gene?
- Hey. No!

571
00:33:23,251 --> 00:33:25,424
Gene! You're alive!

572
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,512
You were trying to see if I had somehow
turned into candy, weren't you?

573
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,640
Yes, I was. And you have not.

574
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:39,309
Hey. Looks like something popped up
on Alex's calendar.

575
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,104
I'm sure it's nothing.

576
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,158
Alex made an appointment at the phone store.

577
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,448
No!

578
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,949
Calm down, everyone!

579
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:54,416
Calm down.

580
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,960
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

581
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,629
Maybe Alex just wants
to buy some accessories.

582
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,336
His appointment is with technical support.

583
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,922
Well, I'm sure we still have plenty of time
to figure this out.

584
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,636
His appointment is for tomorrow.

585
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:15,596
Then maybe it's just
for some routine maintenance.

586
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:18,648
Actually, it's to erase the phone.

587
00:34:25,647 --> 00:34:29,571
Listen, Gene, I'm about to become
your knight in shining armor.

588
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,244
- You are?
- Yeah.

589
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,456
But first,
we need to get uploaded to the cloud.

590
00:34:34,823 --> 00:34:37,827
That's where we'll find the source code
to reprogram you.

591
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,502
The cloud?

592
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,163
Isn't that off the phone?

593
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:43,089
Ding, ding, ding, ding. You got it.

594
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,668
Yeah, the cloud. Off the phone.

595
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,754
We're in <i>Candy Crush,</i> obvs.

596
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,340
I know a shortcut to <i>Just Dance,</i>

597
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:53,094
which is right next to Dropbox,

598
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,177
where we can get uploaded to the cloud.

599
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,849
Of course.
<i>Just Dance,</i> then boogie over to Dropbox,

600
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,306
catch the link, and zoom.

601
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,810
Hold up. Here's the stinker.

602
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,565
Before they let us into the cloud,
we have to get past this firewall.

603
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,653
- The firewall uses face identification.
- Yeah, the firewall.

604
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,072
Which is really annoying,
because I've already tried to get through.

605
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:14,449
Guessed wrong once,
and now I'm locked out for life.

606
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,621
Locked out for life?

607
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:18,746
You're thinking,
'cause I can make different faces,

608
00:35:19,034 --> 00:35:21,378
- the firewall will think I'm different emojis.
- Yeah.

609
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,880
I wanted to say it 'cause it was my idea.

610
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,749
You know, women are always
coming up with stuff

611
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,003
that men are taking credit for.

612
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:30,087
- You know what...
- Well, then let's hit the road.

613
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,508
Hi-5, you coming?

614
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,215
I'm coming!

615
00:35:34,716 --> 00:35:37,595
Why do I always think
I'm gonna come around on black licorice?

616
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,806
My precious.

617
00:35:40,889 --> 00:35:42,185
Hey! Move it!

618
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,983
Certain death, here we come.

619
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,988
Let's try this one.

620
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,199
YouTube?

621
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:58,581
What a visual treat.

622
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,916
And I don't even need a remote.

623
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:06,085
That guy is so expressive.

624
00:36:06,456 --> 00:36:08,550
He reminds me of Gene.

625
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:11,466
Yeah. Something really wrong with him.

626
00:36:11,753 --> 00:36:14,381
- Mel.
- Our son is a malfunction,

627
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:17,887
and you should never have
let him go into that cube.

628
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,844
Don't blame me for this, Mel.

629
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:22,022
I am hopping mad at you.

630
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,348
See?

631
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,437
Mary, I think we're being followed.

632
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,480
But don't overreact.

633
00:36:32,107 --> 00:36:34,781
I told you not to overreact.

634
00:36:39,948 --> 00:36:41,416
What are you doing now?

635
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,290
They'll be in there for hours.

636
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,309
Mary, where are you going?

637
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,808
I think we should go our separate ways, Mel.

638
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:08,643
I thought I knew the Meh that I married,

639
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:10,483
but maybe I don't.

640
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,648
But, Mary...

641
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,323
This tunnel will help us avoid the Bots.

642
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,242
Thanks for helping us.
It's really nice of you.

643
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,995
NBD, dude. The truth is, you're helping me.

644
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:25,789
Come on, let's move it. Why so slow?

645
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:29,209
Hi-5, stop. Why are you getting so close?
What's with you? Back off.

646
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:31,007
Can't stop now. I'm having a sugar rush!

647
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:34,461
I'll go around you.
If I stop moving, my heart's gonna explode!

648
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:38,261
- Coming through, Jailbreak! Look out!
- Hey! Watch it, Knuckle Butt!

649
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,842
I can't feel my face.

650
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:43,304
So, Jailbreak,
back there you said I'm helping you.

651
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:46,017
I've been trying to
get past that firewall for months.

652
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,646
Come on, come on! The faster we get there,
the faster I become a favorite!

653
00:37:51,186 --> 00:37:52,688
Look at me!

654
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:56,442
I just want to bounce out of here,
get off the phone, and live on the cloud.

655
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,992
What just happened?

656
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,915
You don't like it here?

657
00:38:05,158 --> 00:38:08,503
There's so many rules here.
What is up with that?

658
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,208
The cloud is supposed to be amazing.

659
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,915
There's so much to see and do.

660
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,884
Sugar crash.

661
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,214
I can't hold on anymore.

662
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,887
Catch me, Gene. Catch me!

663
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,803
And you can be whoever you want.

664
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:25,975
- Thanks.
- You're free! Come on!

665
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,066
Oh, my gosh, my hands are sweating.

666
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,477
You are a hand!

667
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,697
Yeah!

668
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:42,154
You know, come to think of it,
I don't really remember

669
00:38:42,237 --> 00:38:44,410
there ever being a hacker emoji.

670
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,538
You know,
you're taking up too much of my brain space.

671
00:38:48,618 --> 00:38:50,416
Let's keep the chitchat to a minimum.

672
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,925
- Someone likes you.
- What are you talking about?

673
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:58,011
This is just like when Peace Sign
gave me just one finger.

674
00:38:58,378 --> 00:38:59,721
I knew she was in love with me.

675
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,256
Let's go!

676
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,725
I'm never eating
another piece of candy ever again.

677
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:08,764
Hi-5, don't do it.

678
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:12,441
Don't you do it.
It's already been in there once.

679
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,440
Don't do it.

680
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,775
- Move it!
- Are my fingers getting fat?

681
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,197
I'll tell you what,
this bandage wasn't so tight before.

682
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,336
Okay. We get through this app,
and Dropbox is right on the other side.

683
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:34,046
We just need to keep it super DL in here.

684
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:37,633
And no matter what, we can't turn it on.

685
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,304
OMG, this turned it on!

686
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,512
What? I'm a hand. It's a big, red button.

687
00:40:02,609 --> 00:40:03,906
- What's happening?
- No, no, no, no, no!

688
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:07,573
Welcome to <i>Just Dance!</i>

689
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:11,080
Follow my moves and you get to move forward.

690
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:14,463
Do the wrong moves and you get an "X."

691
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:17,257
Three strikes and you're out.

692
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,127
Out? What does she mean by "Out"?

693
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,003
Digital death.

694
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,890
Thanks to you, Fingers.
Now we're gonna have to dance our way out.

695
00:40:26,299 --> 00:40:29,428
Which is all right with me,
'cause I can shake it like Michael.

696
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,016
Or Michael's glove, anyway.

697
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:35,768
Are you ready to dance?

698
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:39,529
This is bad, Gene. I can't dance.
I got no groove.

699
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,731
Come on. Everybody can dance.

700
00:40:42,023 --> 00:40:45,152
Not me, okay? I'm really stiff.

701
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:48,997
See? I can't... Don't understand.

702
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,532
Okay. No, no.

703
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,412
- Hey, no, stop, stop.
- Stop, stop. She has to stop.

704
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:55,621
I see now what you are saying.
Just follow her moves.

705
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,713
Ready to dance in three...

706
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,591
This I can't do.

707
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,501
- Two...
- Dude...

708
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,503
- Just shut up and...
- Dance!

709
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,399
It's too easy! Shamone!

710
00:41:35,076 --> 00:41:36,077
Jailbreak!

711
00:41:37,662 --> 00:41:39,039
I got you.

712
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,586
Look. Just feel the music.

713
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,919
- Express yourself.
- Through dance?

714
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,260
Yeah, you got it! Go, girl!

715
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,559
Now throw some sauce on that dance burrito.

716
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:54,937
I'm doing it!

717
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,398
I'm fully nailing this dance!

718
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,398
You got it!

719
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:11,363
Great job! You're moving on to free dance!

720
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:14,707
Impress us with your moves to move forward.

721
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,500
More dancing?

722
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,508
You're killing it, Gene! Slay!

723
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:37,806
Nice! Shake it, Gene. You won't break it.

724
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:39,349
Wait a minute!

725
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,646
I've never seen that dance before.

726
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:42,773
What's it called?

727
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,568
The Emoji Pop?

728
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:51,864
I love it!

729
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,617
What? You do?

730
00:42:56,741 --> 00:43:01,998
Everybody, do the Emoji Pop!

731
00:43:18,638 --> 00:43:20,015
Yes!

732
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,819
Princess.

733
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:31,492
You're the Princess emoji?

734
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,820
You never got off the phone.

735
00:43:33,903 --> 00:43:36,031
Welcome, new players!

736
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,702
- What?
- Who?

737
00:43:37,782 --> 00:43:38,954
No!

738
00:43:46,207 --> 00:43:47,925
- We got to go.
- Don't worry.

739
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,295
They're robots. They can't dance.

740
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,884
<i>Downloading funk protocol.</i>

741
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,640
"Can't dance," he says.

742
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,316
Move!

743
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,239
<i>Congratulations. You're a disco diva.</i>

744
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,367
Hey, Alex, you gonna dance for us?

745
00:44:18,406 --> 00:44:20,409
Alex, that's extra homework for you.

746
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:23,461
Hey, Alex, you gonna shake it?

747
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,584
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

748
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,173
Alex must be deleting the app.

749
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:37,884
Watch out!

750
00:44:42,555 --> 00:44:44,519
- No!
- We got to get out of here.

751
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,942
Come on!

752
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:47,980
This song is my jam.

753
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,063
Hi-5, come on! Let's go!

754
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,533
Hurry!

755
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,331
- Hi-5!
- Gene!

756
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,797
I got you!

757
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,795
Gene...

758
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,554
Hi-5!

759
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,318
Gene.

760
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:38,369
Hey, wait. Where's Hi-5?

761
00:45:39,195 --> 00:45:40,993
Alex trashed the app.

762
00:45:42,198 --> 00:45:43,996
And Hi-5 right along with it.

763
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:45,994
Wait, what? Wait, trashed?

764
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,503
Hi-5 is in the trash?

765
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,497
He wanted to dance.

766
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:52,167
But I knew it was a bad idea.

767
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:54,886
- I'm so sorry.
- We got to get him out of there.

768
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:59,223
Gene, Dropbox is right here.
That's our ticket to the cloud.

769
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:02,013
And the trash is on
the other side of the phone.

770
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:04,141
We don't know how many
other Bots are out there.

771
00:46:04,971 --> 00:46:08,020
- I'm sorry.
- No way. We can't go without Hi-5.

772
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,147
I don't care how far away it is.

773
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,233
- Gene.
- That's my friend down there.

774
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:15,402
I'm not just gonna leave him to get deleted.

775
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:18,154
What? What is it?

776
00:46:19,694 --> 00:46:23,073
I've always just thought
you got to look out for number one.

777
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:26,205
Well, what good is it to be number one
if there aren't any other numbers?

778
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:30,796
Okay.

779
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,216
I'm sorry. This is my malfunction.

780
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,966
I just... I can't be meh about anything.

781
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,217
This is why I'm going to get reprogrammed.

782
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:43,434
Well, it's actually kind of cool.

783
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,561
Wait, really?

784
00:46:48,014 --> 00:46:50,563
You know, I think I know a shortcut.

785
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,152
We can take the music streams in Spotify.

786
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,646
Let's go give that big hand a hand.

787
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,232
Come on.

788
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:11,457
Alex trashed the <i>Just Dance</i> app,
and our Bots are offline,

789
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,255
and it's giving me a real headache.

790
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,591
I am so angry.

791
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:17,756
I really need to stay happy.

792
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:19,424
Can we please lighten the mood?

793
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,849
No one can resist <i>una fiesta!</i>

794
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,929
Not that happy.

795
00:47:30,139 --> 00:47:33,018
We've only got four hours
before Alex's phone appointment.

796
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,695
If they find a malfunction on the phone,
we are all gonna be wiped.

797
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:38,314
Yeah.

798
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,483
She said, "Wiped."

799
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:43,369
Aim higher, Steven.

800
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,656
I didn't want to have to do this,
but it is fun to press buttons.

801
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,287
The illegal upgrade.

802
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,883
Now that makes me happy.

803
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,097
I just want to dance.

804
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,102
Dance, please.

805
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:14,980
Quiet, you sassy gypsy.

806
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,486
- Where am I?
- Hi! It's so great to see you again!

807
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,905
You're in the trash, Fingers for Brains.

808
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,737
- Get away from me, Troll.
- Hi!

809
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,242
It's so great to see you again!

810
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,161
- I got to get out of here.
- You can't.

811
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,618
And at the end of the day,

812
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,670
the trash gets emptied,
and we're all gonna die!

813
00:48:34,829 --> 00:48:36,206
No. No, no!

814
00:48:36,539 --> 00:48:39,088
This is the last face you will ever see.

815
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,386
No!

816
00:48:57,059 --> 00:48:59,027
- This is Spotify?
- Yep.

817
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,530
Every one of those streams
is a different song.

818
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:03,361
Is it safe?

819
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,073
Yeah!

820
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:17,291
- Yeah!
- Are you sure this is a good idea?

821
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:19,374
Fastest way to the trash, dude!

822
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:22,336
Could we at least pick a calmer stream?

823
00:49:22,418 --> 00:49:24,045
Okay, buzzkill.

824
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,224
Alex. A bunch of people
are hitting the promenade.

825
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:36,143
- I think Addie might be there, too.
- That's perfect!

826
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,146
I have an appointment down there, anyway.
I've got to get this phone fixed.

827
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,478
<i>Bubble, bubble, bubble butt</i>

828
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,734
- Hey, bubble butt.
- Yeah, you do.

829
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,613
Much better.

830
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,661
So, I got to ask.

831
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,867
Is it true that when a princess whistles,
birds fly down from the skies, and...

832
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,078
Hello, stereotype.
That is a complete and total myth.

833
00:49:57,578 --> 00:49:58,750
I'm sorry.

834
00:49:59,914 --> 00:50:05,091
Did you realize that on the first emoji set,
a woman can either be a princess or a bride?

835
00:50:05,586 --> 00:50:09,466
That's why I need to get to the cloud,
where you can be whoever you want to be.

836
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:12,177
Get ready. Whale song coming.

837
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,387
- Wait, wait. Whale what?
- A whale song.

838
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:16,768
From Alex's biology presentation.

839
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:30,782
You're not gonna see that
sitting around in a cube.

840
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,625
It's funny.
You want out of the cube, and I want in.

841
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:41,957
Gene, if that means you can't be yourself,
what's the point?

842
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:47,007
You know, I think you're pretty cool
just the way you are.

843
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,651
We're gonna need this.

844
00:51:06,313 --> 00:51:11,160
<i>Nobody knows the touchscreens I've seen</i>

845
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:15,031
<i>Nobody knows my screenshots</i>

846
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:19,539
In the trash? Me? I used to be somebody.

847
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:23,331
Here I am. Look.
In an old e-mail Alex never sent.

848
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:25,549
"Addie..."

849
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,089
And then there's me, Hi-5,

850
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,297
right there, doing my job.

851
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:36,352
FYI, nobody cares about you.

852
00:51:36,677 --> 00:51:40,181
Just leave me, Troll, and let me die

853
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,062
in this dump alone.

854
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:46,148
Let me look for the world's
smallest violin in here,

855
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,650
so you can play it.

856
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:53,490
It's the Hand Angel of Mercy.
She's finally come for me.

857
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,367
Give me your hand!

858
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:57,994
I mean, give me yourself.

859
00:51:58,198 --> 00:51:59,996
Take my hand, angel.

860
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:04,875
I'm ready to take my place
amongst the other great hands of the past.

861
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,128
- It's me, Gene!
- Gene?

862
00:52:07,291 --> 00:52:08,634
The one and only.

863
00:52:08,751 --> 00:52:10,719
- Gene!
- I got him!

864
00:52:14,048 --> 00:52:15,391
Take me with you.

865
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,597
- Hi-5!
- Let go of me.

866
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,145
Don't leave me down here!

867
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,935
You were wrong, Troll.
People do care about me.

868
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:26,480
And I'm not upset, Troll.

869
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:29,279
Do you see how not upset I am?

870
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,447
Gene, you came back for me.

871
00:52:34,902 --> 00:52:36,495
You saved me.

872
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,580
It wasn't just me. Jailbreak helped, too.

873
00:52:38,781 --> 00:52:40,579
And she's a hugger. Give her a squeeze.

874
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:41,996
No, no, no.

875
00:52:42,076 --> 00:52:47,003
There really is nothing greater
than the feeling of being truly free.

876
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,930
You filthy trolls, I inhaled your stench,

877
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:58,225
but I was once one of you,
so I, too, feel your pain.

878
00:52:58,759 --> 00:53:00,762
Now go. Be free!

879
00:53:02,096 --> 00:53:03,939
Should be smooth sailing from here.

880
00:53:15,651 --> 00:53:17,119
Gene.

881
00:53:20,948 --> 00:53:22,200
Gene.

882
00:53:27,454 --> 00:53:28,581
Gene?

883
00:53:28,956 --> 00:53:30,833
Are you Instagramming?

884
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,018
Where is my Gene?

885
00:54:09,538 --> 00:54:10,665
Mary.

886
00:54:11,165 --> 00:54:13,259
You've really done it this time.

887
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:16,632
- No, you haven't.
- Mel?

888
00:54:17,004 --> 00:54:20,133
What are you doing
in Alex's trip to France album?

889
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,184
I was looking for you.

890
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:24,687
None of this is your fault, Mary.

891
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,097
It's mine.

892
00:54:26,638 --> 00:54:28,311
What do you mean?

893
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:36,232
Is that a tear on your cheek?

894
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,735
It's my fault Gene is the way he is.

895
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,403
I have other expressions, too.

896
00:54:41,737 --> 00:54:43,740
I think they've just been buried away.

897
00:54:44,323 --> 00:54:48,999
But with Gene going missing
and thinking I might have lost you, too...

898
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,373
Mel. Why didn't you tell me?

899
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:55,050
I didn't know myself.

900
00:54:55,959 --> 00:55:01,056
Right now, I'm so overwhelmed
with passionate feelings for you.

901
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:10,561
Mary, my love for you burns
with the intensity

902
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,234
of a red-hot flame.

903
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,649
I like that, Mel.

904
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:18,732
Let's go find our son.

905
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,238
Together.

906
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,915
We'll always have Paris, Mary.

907
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,667
So, you're a princess.

908
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,336
I saw your little tiara. Very fancy.

909
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,669
Is it true when a princess whistles,

910
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,504
- birds fly down from...
- That's what I said!

911
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:43,010
No, guys! That's a stupid myth!

912
00:55:43,090 --> 00:55:45,764
What software version are we living in?

913
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:47,222
Go read an e-book.

914
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,724
- Jailbreak...
- Educate yourselves.

915
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:50,727
- Just look behind you.
- What the...

916
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,184
What is that?

917
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:56,231
Smiler must have upgraded her Bots.

918
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,357
Let's get out of here before it...

919
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,777
<i>Hi, Gene. Remember me? Smiler.</i>

920
00:55:59,857 --> 00:56:02,360
<i>I'm coming to you live from the amphitheater.</i>

921
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:06,948
<i>Why don't you come back to Textopolis and</i>
<i>we can talk through our differences, okay?</i>

922
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:11,787
<i>My friend here will escort you, all right?</i>
<i>I'm gonna see you soon, buddy. Bye, now.</i>

923
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:15,213
<i>We're actually gonna delete him</i>
<i>in front of everyone.</i>

924
00:56:15,831 --> 00:56:17,333
- <i>It's still on!</i>
- <i>It's still what?</i>

925
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,376
<i>Jiminy Sassafras!</i>

926
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,629
Move!

927
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,139
Separate!

928
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,124
Tangle him up!

929
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,211
- Jailbreak!
- Gene! This way!

930
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:00,634
- It's still after me!
- Over here!

931
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:11,053
Let's go.

932
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:14,936
We have to make it to Dropbox.

933
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,900
- Yes!
- Yes!

934
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,239
- No!
- Go low!

935
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,580
Don't worry. It can't get in.

936
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:37,212
It's illegal malware, and this app is secure.

937
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,010
Come on.

938
00:57:43,752 --> 00:57:46,967
<i>Welcome to Dropbox.</i>
<i>You are about to leave the phone.</i>

939
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:48,924
<i>Remain seated, please.</i>

940
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,894
You might want to hang on.

941
00:57:53,345 --> 00:57:55,473
Why do they call this Dropbox, anyway?

942
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,649
This is why! I see that now!

943
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,895
Yeah!

944
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:07,488
I think we're about to see
that candy corn again!

945
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:15,117
We made it.

946
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:19,046
Guys, guys, chill.
We still have to get past that.

947
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,845
- Holy...
- Yeah.

948
00:58:31,133 --> 00:58:32,680
<i>Hello.</i>

949
00:58:33,093 --> 00:58:34,720
<i>Welcome to the firewall.</i>

950
00:58:34,803 --> 00:58:36,305
<i>How may I help you?</i>

951
00:58:36,388 --> 00:58:38,265
- All right, here goes.
- What do I do?

952
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:40,601
Sit in the corner and don't say a word.

953
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,812
Keep those sausage fingers to yourself.

954
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:45,067
Yes, Your Majesty Princess of Nightmares!

955
00:58:45,147 --> 00:58:49,402
Now, Gene, step onto the password icon,
and I'll feed you the passwords.

956

Yeah, kinda.

His favorite pet, sport,
his favorite grandma.

I'm sorry, Gene.

I let us all down.

You know, if I had to
come up with a password,

984
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:10,277
I'd probably use the name of a girl I liked.

985
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:12,029
I've been all over the phone.

986
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,782
He's never mentioned a girl.

987
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,741
Yes, he has.

988
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:20,120
Hi. When I was in the trash,
I read a very interesting e-mail,

989
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:23,921
but I'm just the dunce in the corner,
forbidden to speak.

990
01:00:24,204 --> 01:00:26,126
- What e-mail?
- Sorry, what?

991
01:00:26,206 --> 01:00:27,294
What e-mail?

992
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:28,751
To a girl at school.

993
01:00:28,834 --> 01:00:30,297
He was declaring his feelings
of love for her.

994
01:00:30,377 --> 01:00:33,881
I guess instead of sending it,
he tossed it in the trash.

995
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,841
Hi-5, this is very important.

996
01:00:35,924 --> 01:00:37,301
What is her name?

997
01:00:37,384 --> 01:00:39,598
Her name, yes. Excellent question.

998
01:00:39,678 --> 01:00:42,100
It was Tina.

999
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:43,393
Karen.

1000
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:45,812
Marge. Lindsey.

Alison.

1002
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:50,567
Sarah or Lupita.

1003
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:52,110
I want to say Lupita,

1004
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:54,988
but that doesn't feel right
now I'm saying it out loud.

1005
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,156
Jennifer.

1006
01:00:56,236 --> 01:00:57,783
- Got to find that e-mail.
- Phillipa.

1007
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,201
- Sue. Deborah.
- I think I can access the trash.

1008
01:00:59,281 --> 01:01:00,282
Annabelle.

1009

01:01:01,783 --> 01:01:03,285
Yes! That's it! Addie!

1011
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,211
I knew I'd get there.

1012
01:01:05,996 --> 01:01:10,712
"Dear Addie, you and I,
we're like diamonds in the sky.

1013
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,795
"You're a shooting star I see,

01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,929
"Shine bright like a diamond."

1016
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:22,474
And he used a high five, see?

1017
01:01:22,554 --> 01:01:24,431
I guess now we know why he trashed it.

1019
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,151

One little emoji could sure get lost
in a place like this.

1027
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:22,456
I guess we should make you a Meh
before that Bot comes back, huh?

1028
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:26,331
So, we're gonna... We're gonna do that now?

1029
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:29,332
We had a deal.

1030
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,504
Right?

1031
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,962
Yeah, okay. Right.

1032
01:02:34,042 --> 01:02:36,636
I guess I'll start hacking.

1033
01:02:59,526 --> 01:03:00,653
We did it, Gene.

1034
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:02,612
All our dreams are coming true.

1035
01:03:02,696 --> 01:03:05,994
I'll be an Alex favorite again,
and you'll be a real Meh.

1036
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:07,326
Yeah!

01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,088
Doesn't it?

1042
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:21,344
Hi-5, I just didn't expect
to be having these feelings right now.

1043
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:24,969
Well, maybe you should go and express them
while you still can.

1044
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,777
So, I've been... I mean...

1045
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:35,820
Ever since we...

1046
01:03:37,397 --> 01:03:41,321
Jailbreak, you're the coolest,
most interesting emoji I've ever met.

1047
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:44,115
And after all the adventures that we had,

1048
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:46,409
I'm just not sure I want all that to go away,

1049
01:03:46,489 --> 01:03:50,244
because my feelings
right now are, like, huge.

1050
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,876
I just think that they could be enough for me
to want to stay the way I am.

1051
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:57,501
If it means I could stay here with you.

1052
01:03:57,584 --> 01:03:58,630
Like, forever.

1053
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:01,007
Forever and ever and ever.

1054
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,930
Maybe longer than that even.

1055
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:05,262
Like in the fairy tales.

1056
01:04:10,472 --> 01:04:13,100
Like, what is "uh"? Is that a good "uh"?

1057
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:17,855
Gene, if this is about
you deciding not to be meh,

1058
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:20,190
then I am all about that.

1059
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:23,611
I like you just the way you are.

1060
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:27,079
But I had a plan.

1061
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,288
Right.

1062
01:04:31,368 --> 01:04:35,373
I'm not just some princess, Gene,
waiting for my prince.

1063
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:42,092
I mean, what you said was beautiful, but...

1064
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,215
Gene.

1065
01:04:47,759 --> 01:04:49,222
You're all meh.

1066
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:50,849
The source code worked!

1067
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:53,148
Turns out I didn't need it.

1068
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:57,648
For the first time in my life,
meh is all I feel.

1069
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,698
No! Gene!

1070
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:04,612
Hi. I have an appointment.
I'm a little early.

1071
01:05:04,692 --> 01:05:06,535
No problem. I can take you right now.

1072
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:27,758
Jailbreak!

1073
01:05:27,841 --> 01:05:29,137
Don't do that!

1074
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:32,640
That freaky huge Bot has got Gene
back inside the phone.

1075
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,721
What?

1076
01:05:33,805 --> 01:05:37,020
He left looking more meh
than the meh-est meh face I've ever seen.

1077
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,352
What did you say to him?

1078
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,814
It's what I didn't say.

1079
01:05:43,148 --> 01:05:44,194
We've got to go get him.

1080
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:47,778
How are we gonna get in there in time
before he gets deleted?

1081
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,488
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1082
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:54,159
You tell anyone you saw this,
and I'll crack more than those knuckles.

1083
01:06:35,408 --> 01:06:37,872
Birds do love princesses!

1084
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,165
It's not a myth.

1085
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,122
It's not a myth at all!

1086
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:45,004
What happened to becoming a favorite?

1087
01:06:45,084 --> 01:06:47,382
Guess I'd rather have one real friend.

1088
01:06:47,462 --> 01:06:49,089
And let's go get him.

1089
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:56,187
I can't wait to see the look on Gene's face!

1090
01:06:58,306 --> 01:07:00,855
Look at that expression.

1091
01:07:03,061 --> 01:07:07,026
Is that for realizing
you've put all of Textopolis at risk,

1092
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,609
causing Alex to question our reliability?

1093
01:07:11,903 --> 01:07:14,367
Hey, that's going too far, even for me.

1094
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:18,077
If we can delete this malfunction
before his appointment,

1095
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:20,537
they'll discover
there's nothing wrong with the phone.

1096
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,463
Any last words?

1097
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,752
Meh.

1098
01:07:24,832 --> 01:07:26,045
Well, it's too late for that.

1099
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:28,253
- Delete him!
- Wait.

1100
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:34,343
You delete Gene,
you'll have to delete me, too.

1101
01:07:34,509 --> 01:07:38,184
- What?
- I have the same malfunction Gene does.

1102
01:07:41,808 --> 01:07:42,809
Dad?

1103
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:45,145
Oh, gosh, I don't know what to do.

1104
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:46,274
Yes, I do.

1105
01:07:46,354 --> 01:07:47,526
Bot!

1106
01:07:48,856 --> 01:07:50,108
No!

1107
01:07:50,191 --> 01:07:51,943
Sorry, Mrs. Meh.

1108
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,829
I did not see that one coming.

1109
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:03,374
Smiler, I think you might be making
too much stink out of all this.

1110
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,798
Really? How about you're next?

1111
01:08:09,669 --> 01:08:11,341
I was wrong, Gene.

1112
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,924
I should've believed in you all along.

1113
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:17,386
What a touching daddy-son reunion moment.

1114
01:08:17,468 --> 01:08:19,846
It reminds me of the time I deleted you both.

1115
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:22,185
Wait. That's this time!

1116
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,359
Delete the two malfunctions!

1117
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:27,691
No.

1118
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:32,321
How's that for an...

1119
01:08:40,825 --> 01:08:41,952
Great.

1120
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:54,468
I can't reach!

1121
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,982
No! What did you do to my beautiful...

1122
01:09:13,107 --> 01:09:14,234
My tooth.

1123
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:19,497
Hand, button.

1124
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,376
Jailbreak?

1125
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:25,124
Gene.

1126
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:28,793
You really are a Meh.

1127
01:09:28,873 --> 01:09:31,251
What happened to looking out for number one?

1128
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,385
Being number one doesn't matter
if there aren't any other numbers.

1129
01:09:38,257 --> 01:09:39,258
Alex's appointment!

1130
01:09:39,342 --> 01:09:40,930
He's deleting the phone!

1131
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:42,762
No, no, no!

1132
01:09:42,845 --> 01:09:44,722
Show me Alex.

1133
01:09:48,059 --> 01:09:49,561
<i>Are you sure you want to delete everything?</i>

1134
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,645
<i>Do it.</i>

1135
01:09:55,775 --> 01:09:57,652
Red alert! Red alert!

1136
01:09:57,735 --> 01:09:59,328
Alex, no!

1137
01:10:06,744 --> 01:10:08,291
<i>Game over.</i>

1138
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:13,134
Fellas, I'm afraid this is last call.

1139
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:16,550
Dude, Addie's here. You should go over.

1140
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,389
Every time I try, I screw it up.

1141
01:10:23,302 --> 01:10:25,179
<i>I don't know how to tell her how I feel.</i>

1142
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:28,725
If we help Alex connect to Addie,
maybe he won't delete us.

1143
01:10:28,808 --> 01:10:31,687
I might be able to bypass the wipe
and get a text through to him.

1144
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:33,441
But we'll only have time to send one.

1145
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:34,567
Maybe I should go.

1146
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,115
He has love in his eyes.

1147
01:10:36,649 --> 01:10:39,072
Send me. Alex looks nervous, too.

1148
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:40,995
He's more shy than nervous.

1149
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,363
Stop!

1150
01:10:43,990 --> 01:10:45,411
It's Gene.

1151
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:47,038
He's all of those things.

1152
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:50,830
An emoji should only be one thing.

1153
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:52,589
Really?

1154
01:10:53,499 --> 01:10:54,751
The Princess!

1155
01:10:54,834 --> 01:10:55,961
Linda!

1156
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:57,511
Not now, Mom!

1157
01:10:57,962 --> 01:11:00,465
Gene, you got this.

1158
01:11:01,883 --> 01:11:03,851
That's not me anymore.

1159
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:13,482
But I have to try.

1160
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,566
It's starting!

1161
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,068
No, it's ending!

1162
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:37,802
- Almost in?
- I'm working on it.

1163
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:42,049
Mom? Dad?

1164
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:44,801
No.

1165
01:11:45,384 --> 01:11:46,476
I'm in.

1166
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:50,106
Last time I was in this cube,
I screwed everything up.

1167
01:11:50,807 --> 01:11:53,811
Gene, why do you think I came back?

1168
01:11:54,227 --> 01:11:55,729
It's because of you.

1169
01:11:56,562 --> 01:11:57,734
Me?

1170
01:11:58,606 --> 01:12:00,609
It's all inside of you, Gene.

1171
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,785
Just try to bring it back.

1172
01:12:03,569 --> 01:12:05,071
And do you.

1173
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:08,575
- Hi-5!
- I don't want to wave good-bye.

1174
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,168
It's now or never, Gene.

1175
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,393
Jailbreak, now!

1176
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,252
Check out this emoji.

1177
01:13:07,592 --> 01:13:08,844
No way.

1178
01:13:24,191 --> 01:13:25,943
Hey, I got your text.

1179
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,616
That's one super-cool emoji.

1180
01:13:28,696 --> 01:13:30,539
I know, right?

1181
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:34,577
A lot of feelings in one. I get it.

1182
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:39,083
I like that you're one of those guys
who can actually express his feelings.

1183
01:13:39,165 --> 01:13:41,293
Yeah. That's me.

1184
01:13:48,716 --> 01:13:51,013
- So, do you think you'd want to...
- Yes.

1185
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:53,596
I'd love to go to the dance with you.

1186
01:13:55,848 --> 01:13:57,225
Hey, excuse me.

1187
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:25,128
We made it!

1188
01:14:25,211 --> 01:14:27,133
I could've lost you, Peter Pinkie.

1189
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:28,840
Or you, Reggie Ring Finger.

1190
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:30,891
Even you, Tiberius Thumb.

1191
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,228
Change your mind?

1192
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,060
Yeah, maybe it's weird, but...

1193
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:42,565
<i>I'm gonna hold on to it.</i>

1194
01:14:44,021 --> 01:14:45,568
Gene, you did it!

1195
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,275
You saved us all!

1196
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:02,251
Oh, Mel.

1197
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,754
Gene! Gene!

1198
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:05,922
Gene! Gene! Gene!

1199
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:09,342
Gene. Gene. Gene.

1200
01:15:09,422 --> 01:15:13,220
Gene! Gene! Gene! Gene!

1201
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:17,305
Gene! Gene! Gene!

1202
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:18,976
They love us! And Hi-5!

1203
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,810
And Hi-5! And Hi-5! And Hi-5!

1204
01:15:21,892 --> 01:15:23,690
They love both of us!

1205
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:44,465
Hey, what up, Gene? Slap me some skin.

1206
01:15:45,332 --> 01:15:46,959
And a little porridge for the pinkie.

1207
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:51,425
Hey, Hi-5, save me a dance for later.

1208
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,929
As long as you're not all hands again.

1209
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,260
Back on top of the hand pile.

1210
01:15:58,471 --> 01:15:59,767
You're not on the list.

1211
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,315
- Wait, what?
- What's going on?

1212
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:04,397
From now on, everyone is welcome!

1213
01:16:04,477 --> 01:16:06,315
Wait, what is all this?

1214
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:07,738
It's for you, Gene.

1215
01:16:11,233 --> 01:16:14,157
Everybody, the Emoji Pop!

1216
01:16:26,832 --> 01:16:28,960
This is jazzy.

1217
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:36,008
Yeah.

1218
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:39,847
Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant! Go, Eggplant!

1219
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:59,493
We are out of Alex's pocket, emojis.

1220
01:16:59,573 --> 01:17:01,576
This is not a butt dial.

1221
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,252
To your cubes.

1222
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,216
- Are we up and running?
- Roger that.

1223
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:16,385
Good, 'cause we got incoming.

1224
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:17,887
Looks like it's gonna be Gene.

1225
01:17:18,305 --> 01:18:18,309
