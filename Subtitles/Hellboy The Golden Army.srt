00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,640
My son will you turn off
that wretched puppet?

4
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,560
Brush your teeth.

5
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,310
Don't call him a puppet.

6
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,860
I beg your pardon.

7
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,570
Look he's not a puppet.

8
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,860
Howdy Doody's real.

9
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,070
Well...
He's real.

10
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,700
Mr. Deedee
Doodoo will have
to say good night.

11
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,530
Oh no.

12
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,120
And remember
you have to be asleep

13
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,700
when he comes
down the chimney.

14
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,660
It's not even a chimney Pop.

15
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,920
He has his ways.

16
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,330
Then I want to wait up.
Watch him do it.

17
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,460
Nonsense.

18
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:03,300
Okay.
I want a story then.

19
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,760
Oh no no no.
No stories tonight.

20
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,930
Just one.
And then I'll go to bed.

21
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:08,430
Right away.

22
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,220
Then I'll brush my teeth
I promise.

23
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,780
"It is said that
at the dawn of time

24
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:31,740
"man beast and all magical

"But man had been created
with a hole in his heart

"a hole that no

{i1}in dread and despair.{i0}

33
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,040
{i1}"But one day the master{i0}
{i1}of the goblin blacksmiths{i0}

34
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:27,210
{i1}"offered to build the king{i0}
{i1}a golden mechanical army{i0}

45

But wait
what if someone could
challenge him?

46
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,850
Would they have a fight?

47
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,180
Well most likely.

48
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,430
A challenge must
be answered.

49
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:19,600
But do you want to hear
the end of this story or not?

50
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,770
Yes please.

51
00:04:20,850 --> 00:04:21,890
Right.

{i1}"So he called a truce{i0}

71
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:54,360
Wow. What does it
mean "industrable"?

72
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,650
Indestructible.

73

Indestruct...

74

can destroy them.

Wow.

76
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,540
Go to sleep my son.

77
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,500
But it's just
a story right Pops?

78
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,660
Is it now?

79
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,080
Yeah come on.

80
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,500
Those guys
they can't be real.

81
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,710
Well my son
I'm sure you'll find out.

82
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,020
How long have you
been there my friend?

83
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,690
They're over there.

84
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,190
I bought them today.

85
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,860
I haven't fed them at all.

86
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:07,040
I will go up first.
You will follow.

87
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,160
And remember Mr. Wink
don't be shy.

88
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:39,860
{i1}Next lot. Number 776.{i0}

89
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,450
{i1}This is an important{i0}

{i1}piece harkens back{i0}

103
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,120
{i1}to the saga of{i0}
{i1}the Sons of the Earth{i0}

104
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:30,700
{i1}and the creation of{i0}

Ladies and gentlemen
please keep your seats.

108
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,350
The auction will
restart shortly.

109
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,730
I'm sure this is just
a temporary loss of power.

110
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,310
Now for the first
time at auction

111
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,940
a piece of the Royal
Crown of Bethmoora

112
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,070
coming to us from
a long lost culture.

113
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,650
Lost?

114
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,410
Not at all.

115
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,870
Forgotten by you
perhaps

116
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:13,370
but very very much alive.

117
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,960
Who are you sir?

118
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,080
Sir please identify yourself.
You can't just...

119
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:22,670
I am Prince
Nuada Silverlance
son of King Balor.

120
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:27,430
And I am here sir
to reclaim what
is rightfully mine.

121
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,590
Security. Call security!

122
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:07,800
What do you think
you're doing?

123
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,130
This is outrageous.

124
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:11,180
Take what you want.
Please leave.

125
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,180
Anything take anything.

126
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,270
Be quiet.

127
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,320
Sit down!

128
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,950
Proud empty hollow
things that you are.

129
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,750
Let this remind you
why you once
feared the dark.

130
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:27,590
{i1}Fishstick. We have to talk.{i0}

131
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:31,590
Undercover.

132
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:33,090
Can't he get the
meaning of the word?

133
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,890
Look we are still
government-funded.

134
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:38,560
We are still a secret
although a dirty secret
if you ask me.

135
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:42,140
Officially we do
not exist you see.

136
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:45,150
So that's the problem
when we get these.

137
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,610
Subway. Highway. Park.

138
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:53,990
And he posed for this one
and gave an autograph.

139
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,450
I suppress each photo.
Cell phone videos.

140
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:02,210
They cost me
a fortune and they
show up on YouTube.

141
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,920
God I hate YouTube.

142
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,210
Well he just
wants the world outside
to know what we do

143
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,050
what he does.

144
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,920
He loathes me.

145
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,010
I don't think so.

146
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,340
No?

147
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,510
Target practice.

148
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,680
Oh dear.

149
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,100
And then he
posts them around.

150
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,640
Do you know how
that makes me feel?

151
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,320
What's going on?

152
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,690
Oh it's Friday.

153
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,610
I tell you Fishstick
he hates me.

154
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,860
He's out to destroy me.

155
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,870
My street cred is low.

156
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,070
Street cred?

157
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,200
My mojo.

158
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,200
Washington
they're wondering
if I've got the stuff.

159
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,540
You think I have
an easy job?

160
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:49,540
Do you think
I enjoy being
a pain in the neck?

161
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,760
I am medicated.

162
00:13:55,050 --> 00:13:56,550
I mean
this is not candy.

163
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,140
This is...
It's an antacid.

164
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:00,010
Yes it's an
over-the-counter
medicine

165
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,720
but this is medicine.

166
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,350
You see I worry
because you know

167
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,480
I mean I am
we are after all

168
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,650
we're just humble
public servants.

169
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:15,860
It's not about you.
He's acting out.

170
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:18,160
Things are a little
tense with Liz.

171
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,490
Tense? How tense?
Tense how?

172
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,080
Well you know the usual.

173
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,460
A new couple
making adjustments.

174
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,460
They argue.
They argue huh?

175
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,670
Sometimes.
How bad?

176
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,000
Like everybody else.

177
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,090
They have good days
and bad days.

178
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,010
I'm not done with you.

179
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,870
Hey Abe.

180
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:04,330
Red come back here!

181
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,540
Manning.

182
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,830
Pick up your clothes!

183
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,080
Yeah yeah yeah.

184
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,620
Put away your things!

185
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,750
Watch it
boys she's on fire.

186
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:15,760
Then again there are
the really bad days.

187
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,930
I'm not afraid
of you you know.

188
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,470
You should be.
Look at this mess.
Look around.

189
00:15:21,550 --> 00:15:24,470
I have one rule.
Don't touch my stuff.

190
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,890
Oh I get it.
That's your rule. Okay.

191
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,310
The one and only.
I'm easy.

192
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,480
How's that even possible?

193
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Everything is your stuff.

194
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,400
The same CD  LP.

195
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,690
It's Al Green.

196
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,900
You can't listen
to Al Green on CD.

197
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,150
But it's good to keep.

198
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,740
And an eight-track.
An eight-track Red?

199
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,450
Yeah well one day
the world's gonna
realize its mistake.

200
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:43,160
Eight-track was
the way to go baby.

201
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,790
Come on kids
you can come out now.

202
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:48,500
That's right
it's all over.
That's right.

203
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,170
And what about me Red?

204
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,830
I need some space.

205
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,510
At least enough to
find my toothbrush.

206
00:15:57,630 --> 00:15:59,840
Toothbrush? Wait a minute.

207
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,010
It's right there.

208
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,600
Red! I can't
live like this.

209
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,350
{i1}Security breach{i0}
{i1}central Manhattan.{i0}

210
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,610
Oh damn.

211
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:15,440
Gotta go.
We all gotta go.

212
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,480
It's an emergency right?

213
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:18,780
{i1}Security breach.{i0}
Let's go.

214
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,360
Red. Red!

215
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,900
{i1}All personnel{i0}
{i1}to garage area.{i0}

216
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,410
Hold on a sec.

217
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,450
Oh jeez it's Manning.
Watch yourself Liz.

218
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,910
Red. Red!

219
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,500
Listen.

220
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,620
Manning.
Hi.

221
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,910
We're going to
downtown Manhattan.

222
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,120
Yeah it'll be fun.

223
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,630
Downtown.
Very dangerous.

224
00:16:34,710 --> 00:16:36,130
Dangerous for you.

225
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:38,340
And for me.

226
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,630
Now I know
you dream of
the outside world

227
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,130
but trust me
it's not that great.

228
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,800
It's savage as a
matter of fact. Bad.

229
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,810
Come on fellas
let's get this out of here.

230
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:50,100
These on the
other hand are good.

231
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:51,810
Mmm.

232
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,440
Cuban.

233
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,980
Good.

234
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:56,190
Being seen?

235
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,320
Bad.

236
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:01,240
Exactly.
I confiscated a box of these
and I'll get you some more.

237
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,820
But you've gotta do me
a little favor tonight
out there.

238
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:08,410
You have to be...
You have to be very very...

239
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,490
Discreet.

240
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:11,040
What? Thank you. Yes.
You're welcome.

241
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,370
Discreet.

242
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:15,540
Invisible. In and out.

243
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,710
Really?
Hey.

244
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,460
Hey I can be
discreet if I wanna be.

245
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,010
I followed you
and Myers didn't I?

246
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:25,180
And then you had him
transferred to Antarctica.

247
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,930
That's very discreet.

248
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:28,760
He said he liked the cold.

249
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,270
Like a shadow.

250
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,770
{i1}Red team Red team.{i0}

251
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,730
Like a shadow
in the night.

252
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:55,790
US Customs
discovered a few
illegally imported items.

253
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:59,380
It's a minor infraction.
And a gas pocket.

254
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,380
They detected
a gas pocket up there.

255
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,720
Now FBI agents
under my command

256
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:10,300
are going up there right now
with special gas equipment.

257
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:15,230
Jeez it stinks in here.

258
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,900
This is worse
than my room.

259
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,690
Waiting for
a report on that.

260
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,940
Say "cheese."

261
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:26,610
Let's go.

262
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:57,100
Whatever they
called us for is over.

263
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:59,810
We had over 70
guests reported.

264
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,480
We have no survivors
no bodies.

265
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,980
Same story here babe.

266
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:05,570
{i1}Don't call me "babe."{i0}

267
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,610
"Abe" I said.
"Abe." Wrong channel.

268
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,950
Abe I think Liz is
still mad at me.

269
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,450
{i1}Still the same channel.{i0}

270
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
Oh!

271
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,180
{i1}Can l ask{i0}
{i1}you a question?{i0}

272
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,520
No.

273
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,430
Now listen.
When we get home later

274
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,270
I'm gonna clean up
my whole mess.

275
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,560
That's not the problem.

276
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:42,650
What is it?

277
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,770
Not now.

278
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,490
Abe what have you got?

279
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,740
Oh this is interesting.

280
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:59,370
Both boxes have
the Royal Seal.

281
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,250
Only delivered
at a time of war.

282
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:41,290
Red? We have company.

283
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,880
{i1}Come on Blue{i0}
{i1}give me something{i0}
{i1}to work with here.{i0}

284
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,420
Burrowing creatures.

285
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,920
How many of them?
{i1}Many.{i0}

286
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,010
There are no corpses
because there
are no leftovers.

287
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,970
{i1}Have you noticed the floor?{i0}

288
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,050
Oh crap.

289
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,140
{i1}Precisely.{i0}

290
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,220
All these things
do is eat and eat.

291
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,230
Then poop
and then eat again.

292
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,140
Remind you of anyone?

293
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,770
Damn it Abe.
What are these things?

294
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,860
{i1}English English.{i0}

295
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,940
Oh they're Tooth Fairies.

296
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,190
Ha!

297
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,320
No no. Third century
Black Forest.

298
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:18,160
Feed mostly on calcium
bones skin organs.

299
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,000
But they do go
for the teeth first.

300
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,080
Hence the name
Tooth Fairies.

301
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,040
I bet you they don't
leave money either.

302
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,010
Oh my God.

303
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:44,020
Liz you're pregnant.

304
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,390
No I'm not.

305
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,850
Yes you are.

306
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,120
What have you got Marble?

307
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,040
Think I may have found one.

308
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,670
But he's kind of cute.

309
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,840
Don't go near it!

310
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,890
It's biting me!

311
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,480
Marble.

312
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,390
It hurts! It hurts!

313
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,250
{i1}Red we need you here!{i0}

314
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:52,460
Marble.

315
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:56,920
Nasty little...

316
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,110
Keep firing Abe.
Keep firing!

317
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,120
Damn.

318
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,020
Sorry lady.

319
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,070
You should be running.

320
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,110
There's a safe upstairs.

321
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,570
How do we get there?

322
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,160
We need a clearing.

323
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,330
Run!

324
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,880
Up to the safe now!

325
00:24:17,050 --> 00:24:18,920
Abe. Up the stairs.

326
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:26,010
Come on Liz
burn them all.
Go. Go!

327
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,140
Yes we're going!

328
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,390
Get in the safe Abe.
Get in the safe!

329
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,490
Oh no no.

330
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,910
No no no!

331
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,160
Steel!

332
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,380
Damned beasts.

333
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:08,890
Fire is mine.

334
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,980
Fire is in me.

335
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,770
Red stay away
from the window!

336
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,440
Fire is me.

337
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,940
Stop biting me!

338
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,080
Fire is me.

339
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,620
World here I come.

340
00:26:18,330 --> 00:26:20,130
What have you done?

341
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,210
Guess we're out.

342
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,380
Hey Hellboy
over here.

343
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Your Royal Highness.

344
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:16,430
Before entering
the council chamber

345
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:21,020
you must surrender
your weapon.

346
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:22,560
I will not.

347
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:31,740
It is protocol
sire for peasant
and prince alike.

348
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,720
For you Sister

349
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,050
anything.

350
00:27:55,390 --> 00:27:59,350
{i1}According to multiple eye{i0}
{i1}witnesses lives were{i0}
{i1}in fact endangered.{i0}

351
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,980
{i1}There you have it Hellboy.{i0}

352
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,770
{i1}But is he really{i0}
{i1}on our side?{i0}

353
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,150
{i1}Do you have superpowers?{i0}

354
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,440
{i1}Well yeah.{i0}

355
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,190
{i1}But really all{i0}
{i1}l wanna be is just{i0}
{i1}an ordinary person{i0}

356
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,490
{i1}just like you and{i0}
{i1}you and everybody.{i0}

357
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,570
Hey guys.
You're missing this.

358
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,080
We're on TV.

359
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:20,160
Liz. Liz
are you all right?

360
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,120
Yeah I'll be out
in a minute.

361
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,790
You don't need to do that.
You can trust me.

362
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,090
My readings are
quite accurate.

363
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,340
Shut up Abe.

364
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,050
Get your damn hand
away from the door.

365
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,090
You have nothing to fear.

366
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,470
In spite of appearances

367
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:37,430
I believe Red
would be an excellent
father figure.

368
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:41,980
{i1}And what about this guy?{i0}

369
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,730
{i1}Walking around{i0}
{i1}with a toilet{i0}
{i1}seat on his head.{i0}

370
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:45,020
A toilet seat!

371
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,480
It's quite obvious it's
a breathing apparatus.

372
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:50,780
Hey I think we gotta
lose the garbage truck.

373
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:52,860
Sends out the wrong signal.

374
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,330
You think that's
our problem?

375
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,950
Transportation?

376
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,460
{i1}And this girl we{i0}
{i1}definitely have to find out{i0}
{i1}what's wrong with her.{i0}

377
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,580
{i1}She's cute though.{i0}
{i1}We should get{i0}
{i1}her on the show.{i0}

378
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:07,500
I hate it when
people stare at me.

379
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:10,210
Makes me feel
like a freak.

380
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,470
You had no right Red.

381
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,630
It's Manning. Could you...

382
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
{i1}How many times do{i0}
{i1}l have to tell you?{i0}

383
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,550
{i1}lt's a gas pocket.{i0}

384
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,140
{i1}And a gaseous{i0}
{i1}phenomenon that occurred...{i0}

385
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Gas pocket.
What an idiot.

386
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,360
You've murdered me.

387
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,650
You have murdered me.

388
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:37,450
You have ridiculed me.

389
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,040
And you have brought
this unto yourself.

390
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,370
What?

391
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:48,380
Washington is sending
down a new BPRD agent.

392
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:49,920
A new guy?

393
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,170
Why?

394
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,670
To look after you.

395
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,930
Sire please.

396
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,040
To set us free.
All of us Father.

397
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,720
A truce based on shame.

398
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,640
The humans have
forgotten the gods

399
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,180
destroyed the Earth.
And for what?

400
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,100
Parking lots.
Shopping malls.

401
00:30:46,190 --> 00:30:48,480
Greed has burned
a hole in their heart
that will never be filled.

402
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:50,730
They will never
have enough.

403
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,240
Honor?

404
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,540
Look at this place.
Where is the honor in it?

405
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:07,000
Father you were
once a proud warrior.

406
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,370
When did you
become their pet?

407
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:15,260
I have returned
from exile to wage war

408
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:18,010
and reclaim our land
our birthright.

409
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,180
And for that I will
call upon the help
of all of my people.

410
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,350
And they will answer

411
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,680
the good the bad

412
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,100
and the worst.

413
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,570
Perhaps I am.
Perhaps they made me so.

414
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,000
We will not fade.

415
00:31:59,930 --> 00:32:01,130
It is.

416
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,890
I am sorry Father.

417
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:20,570
And you Sister
are you at peace with
your king's verdict?

418
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:23,240
I am my brother. I am.

419
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:28,120
Then very well.
Death it is.

420
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,150
Now for the final piece
my sister.

421
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,490
Where is she Wink?
Where is she?

422
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:42,590
Go find her.
Now! Find her!

423
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,300
{i1}Elevator{i0}
{i1}arriving now to section 42.{i0}

424
00:34:51,930 --> 00:34:55,310
{i1}Elevator arriving{i0}
{i1}now to section 42.{i0}

425
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,940
Pardon me boys.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

426
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,690
Is he here?
Not yet.

427
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:01,900
I'm telling you
we don't need this guy.

428
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,070
Well I think we do.

429
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,780
Evidently this
guy's quite the big
shot in Washington.

430
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,950
What's his name?

431
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,070
His name is Johann Krauss.

432
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,740
Johann Krauss?
Sounds German.

433
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,370
He's the top man in...

434
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:15,450
Ectoplasmic.

435
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,790
Yes thank you.
Ectoplasmic research.

436
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:20,380
Comes highly recommended
by our European liaison.

437
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,790
Johann Krauss.
"Liaison."

438
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,460
I love that word
don't you?

439
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:25,090
It's so hoity toity.

440
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,590
I don't like Germans.
No fingerprints.

441
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,380
Here he comes.
Germans make me nervous.

442
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:33,680
No photo. Dossier says
and I translate
"He has a nice open face."

443
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,610
Oh my God.

444
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,870
{i1}Damen und Herren{i0}
Johann Krauss
at your service.

445
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,870
I like him.

446
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,790
Look at that.
Poor little thing.

447
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,550
Bought and sold on
the black market.

448
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,210
Crammed into
cargo containers.

449
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,630
Smuggled abused.

450
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,260
He has very
expressive hands.

451
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,390
The seal on the box
worries me also.

452
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,640
A warring emblem.

453
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,810
Yes from the Bethmoora clan.

454
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,930
The Sons of the Earth.

455
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,140
Your file says
you're the brains
of the operation

456
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:20,730
and I must admit
I'm impressed.

457
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,600
In my file you'll see
Mr. Krauss

458
00:36:22,690 --> 00:36:25,650
that I worked
very closely with Abe
in his training.

459
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:26,820
Ja okay.

460
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,820
Let's see what our little
friend here can remember.

461
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,990
Memory gets a little
sketchy right after
you've burned to death.

462
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,370
But maybe Saint
Malachy can help.

463
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:38,660
Oh no no.
No amulets
{i1}Mein Herr.{i0}

464
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:39,960
Teleplasty.

465
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,580
Plastic. Very modern.

466
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,000
Teleplasty by which
an ectoplasmic medium

467
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:49,050
such as Dr. Krauss
can control inanimate things

468
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:53,680
organic mechanical
dead or alive.

469
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,680
Take it take it
all in mein Junge.

470
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:02,190
There we are. Get up.

471
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:04,650
Get up. Get up.

472
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:08,730
Now I have full control
of its limbic system.

473
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,860
Let us see how long
I can hold it.

474
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,530
What?

475
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,910
Hey you chewed off
the tip of my tail.

476
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:17,870
Yeah you you little...

477
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,370
It says you're rude brutish
und not very bright.

478
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,540
Wow!

479
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,050
It seems our
little friend here

480
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:30,960
remembers market
sounds and voices.

481
00:37:31,050 --> 00:37:33,510
And a peculiar
troll language spoken

482
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,090
in the last place
his cage was opened.

483
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:37,050
The troll market.

484
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,970
The troll market?
Come on.

485
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,390
No one's ever found it.

486
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
That's because
it doesn't exist.

487
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,280
Mr. Krauss? Dr. Krauss sir.

488
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,490
Our little informant there
doesn't look so good.

489
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,840
Back inside you.
There we are.

490
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,340
So now we know
where to begin.

491
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,430
Trolls dwell under bridges.

492
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:18,430
Wow. You're a genius.

493
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:21,930
By the way there's
over 2000 bridges
in New York City.

494
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:25,100
But Vladimir Vanya
19th century
occult historian

495
00:38:25,190 --> 00:38:26,690
places the troll
market directly under

496
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,190
the east end of
the Brooklyn Bridge.

497
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,270
We've already looked there.

498
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,150
Yes you have
but not with me Agent.

499
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,780
Not with me.

500
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,440
We're moving in.

501
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,090
Keep it coming
keep it coming.
Hold it.

502
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:00,390
"Not with me Agent."
What an ego.

503
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,600
I like him.

504
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,560
Well you can keep him.

505
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:08,270
I mean am I the only
one that thinks this
guy is full of...

506
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:09,600
No no no no
don't lean.

507
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,440
Lot 336 the Schufftein
glasses. Could it be?

508
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,150
The three surviving
pairs

509
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,820
and we will use them to
locate the troll market.

510
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,780
Dr. Krauss what a coup.

511
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,570
The Schufftein glasses.

512
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,660
You're my hero.

513
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,830
Hey. You Hellboy?

514
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah.

515
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,710
You're ugly man.

516
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,420
Two more on
the wall in front of me

517
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,090
and then three on
the alleys facing that way.

518
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,420
What do you think of
Mr. Know-It-All?

519
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,590
Don't know
too early to tell.

520
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:37,880
Hey you're Hellboy.

521
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:39,130
I know I'm ugly.

522
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,590
Forget it.

523
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,470
We'll talk about it later.

524
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,730
He's sure of himself
and I think maybe
you're intimidated.

525
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:50,730
Intimidated. Huh?

526
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,360
{i1}Keep us up to{i0}
{i1}date on the cameras{i0}
{i1}Agent Sherman. Over and out.{i0}

527
00:39:59,450 --> 00:40:00,820
What's this?

528
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:05,120
Normally we can't see
fairy folk and trolls.

529
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:09,710
They generate a cloaking
aura called "glamour."

530
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,080
But in 1878
Emil Schufftein designed
and built these.

531
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:16,050
{i1}Four crystal diopters{i0}
{i1}that penetrate that effect{i0}

532
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,590
{i1}and reveal the true{i0}
{i1}nature of things.{i0}

533
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:21,680
Oh Dr. Krauss they're more
beautiful than I'd imagined.

534
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,180
You must try
them on then.
Oh yes.

535
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,100
Try them on Agent.
They'll look good.

536
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:27,020
I love these tight
little leather straps.

537
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,480
Intimidated?

538
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,400
Mr. Kraut? Sir?

539
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,560
Krauss Agent.
With a double "S."

540
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:36,690
S-S. Right right.

541
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,990
Listen those gizmos?

542
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,410
How do you know they work?

543
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:46,530
{i1}l have a suspect.{i0}

544
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,330
Give me a vector
Agent Sherman. A vector.

545
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,000
B-12 the alley northbound.

546
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,330
{i1}Well track the target.{i0}
{i1}We're coming down.{i0}

547
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,630
Keep an eye on her.
I'll be right back.

548
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,460
This little old lady?
Come on.

549
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:01,470
It's a Fragglewump
an ugly Scottish troll.

550
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:03,180
They're afraid of canaries.

551
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Oh my God. Canaries huh?

552
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,310
What about the kittens?

553
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,430
She feeds on them.

554
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:11,850
Come on then.
Kitty kitty kitty.

555
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,600
That thing is a "she"?

556
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,130
Down you fools.

557
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:37,500
What do you think
you are doing?

558
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:38,840
She's gonna eat the cat.

559
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,800
You'll make her
aware of our presence.

560
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,050
We should use
the canary now.

561
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,260
She's gonna eat it!

562
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,550
We should use
the bird Dr. Krauss.

563
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,800
The bird.

564
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,350
She's going to eat the cat.

565
00:41:50,430 --> 00:41:51,520
You will stay put
and follow my orders.

566
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,640
I can't sit by here...

567
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,770
You are directly
under my command
and you have to obey.

568
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,400
Stay put!
Oh screw this!

569
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,810
Hey! Lucy.

570
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,150
Come back here.

571
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:00,900
I'm home.

572
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:03,400
Oh yes dearie.
Can I help you?

573
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:05,700
Give it up nasty.
We can see you.

574
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,160
You see me?

575
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,740
How? How do you see me?

576
00:42:10,790 --> 00:42:12,330
We're looking
for the entrance

577
00:42:12,410 --> 00:42:13,830
to the troll market.
Any clues?

578
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:16,170
Come any closer and
I'll rip your heart.

579
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,000
We're gonna have to get
a little old-school Abe.

580
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,790
Give me the bird.

581
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,010
Not a canary.

582
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,840
What you're afraid
of this little guy?

583
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:27,220
Who'd know?

584
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,510
No more no more.

585
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,100
I'll take you there.

586
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,940
Come on let's go
you dirty old troll.

587
00:42:52,910 --> 00:42:54,370
Let's go.

588
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:57,170
Agent Sherman
we are going into
the troll market.

589
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,580
Keep communication
to a minimum.

590
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:00,000
Over und out.

591
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,880
I like him.

592
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,550
You see this is
a man who takes charge.

593
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:04,630
You think?

594
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,840
Yeah. He's efficient.

595
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,720
He's precise.

596
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:10,220
You add "resistant" to that
you got yourself a new watch.

597
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,060
Dr. Krauss is aware
of the chain of
command and he...

598
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,230
Oh brother!

599
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:16,810
He seems to like me.

600
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,110
OLD Here we are.

601
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:26,530
Wow that's some door!

602
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,660
It's a complex
combination lock.

603
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:34,870
What do you think
Agent Sapien?

604
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,080
Not good.

605
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:40,250
With the number of symbols
on the combination
we'll be here for days.

606
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,420
Well not necessarily.

607
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,210
Let me try my technique.

608
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,590
Open it Lucy.

609
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:46,210
I will not.

610
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,510
Pretty please.

611
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,800
Do as you may demon.

612
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:52,600
Release the yellow beast.

613
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,810
Tear my eyes out.

614
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,810
Rip my insides and
my legs and my tongue

615
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:59,230
but I will never
open that door.

616
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:09,610
Is that your
investigative technique?

617
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:10,860
It said "never."

618
00:44:10,950 --> 00:44:12,450
It's unconscionable.

619
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,580
That means
he didn't like it.

620
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:15,950
What?

621
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,950
So what you're
gonna show us
how it's done

622
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:20,080
Mr. By-The-Book?

623
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:21,750
Is that it?

624
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:24,250
Yes I think I will.

625
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:30,300
There we are.

626
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:34,430
Let me see. Yes.

627
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,490
Gentlemen welcome
to the troll market.

628
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:39,790
{i1}Red there's{i0}
{i1}something really important{i0}
{i1}that l need to tell you.{i0}

629
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:42,460
Oh Liz you should
be here. You'd love it.

630
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:44,920
Nobody's looking at us.
We blend right in.

631
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,710
Agent I said keep
communication to a minimum.

632
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:49,380
You'll blow our cover.

633
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,300
You know?
I think he's right.

634
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,010
I'm bringing you
here for sure babe.

635
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:56,720
{i1}The fishbowl wants{i0}
{i1}radio silence. So...{i0}

636
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,470
Over and out.

637
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:23,000
The Royal Seal.

638
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,760
Brother Red.
Red do you read me?

639
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:42,770
Yeah I read you Blue
but I'm watching
Sherlock at work.

640
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:43,980
I'll get back to you.

641
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,100
Excuse me sir.

642
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,940
Sir excuse... Pardon me.
Sir may I ask a...

643
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,450
I gotta tell
the boys that one.

644
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:56,570
Excuse me gentlemen.

645
00:46:56,650 --> 00:46:59,570
Have you seen anyone
purchasing this
type of Tooth Fairy?

646
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,240
No one sells them
down here pal.

647
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:02,830
Over in Jersey maybe.

648
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:04,910
Well what about this then?

649
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:07,040
Do you recognize this seal?

650
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:08,580
Make him go away.
Make him go away.

651
00:47:08,670 --> 00:47:10,040
No. We don't.

652
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:11,290
Please dear sir.

653
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,880
You'd better go. Now!

654
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:15,130
We'll make it
worth your while.

655
00:47:16,420 --> 00:47:19,050
Don't waste your time.
We will not talk!

656
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:20,550
What are you doing?

657
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:22,350
You're absolutely
sure about that huh?

658
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:23,810
Absolutely.

659
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:24,970
You won't talk eh?

660
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,060
Never.

661
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:27,310
Never huh?

662
00:47:27,390 --> 00:47:29,810
Never ever ever.

663
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,050
Feeling a little
chattier now?

664
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:57,510
We'll never talk.

665
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,180
Yes yes.

666
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:01,760
We will only don't
hit me anymore.

667
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:03,350
Chicken.

668
00:48:03,430 --> 00:48:05,010
Who bought
the Tooth Fairies?

669
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:06,680
Prince Nuada.

670
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:08,850
They say Prince Nuada
broke the truce

671
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:10,560
and now there is
talk of war

672
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:12,770
a war with
the human world.

673
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,400
Sorry kid.

674
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:16,860
That's all right.

675
00:48:17,110 --> 00:48:18,440
Nice baby.

676
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,990
I'm not a baby.
I'm a tumor.

677
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:28,290
Yes Red. I am
following a lead
right now.

678
00:48:28,370 --> 00:48:30,040
It may turn out...

679
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,790
It may turn out
to be nothing

680
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,210
but I will let you
know soon enough.

681
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,910
What do you want?
Tell me your name.

682
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:17,250
Follow me.

683
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,760
Your father
left you this map.

684
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,840
In it he said
lies the secret

685
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,510
to the location
of the Golden Army.

686
00:49:28,850 --> 00:49:31,310
Move away!
Quickly Your Highness.

687
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:36,480
Can I help you
with something?

688
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,400
No thank you.
I'm just looking.

689
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,230
You can't go in there!

690
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,780
Sir why
are you following me?

691
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,360
I...

692
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,280
I was just hoping
to find an old map
chart of Algiers.

693
00:49:47,370 --> 00:49:48,950
Why are you following me?

694
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:50,700
I was not.

695
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:53,540
Did my brother send you
to steal the crown piece?

696
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,870
Your brother?

697
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,750
Oh you're sorely
mistaken I assure you.

698
00:49:58,250 --> 00:49:59,710
Then answer me truthfully.

699
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:01,550
Why were you following me?

700
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:06,760
My name is Abraham Sapien.

701
00:50:08,470 --> 00:50:09,640
There is no such name.

702
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:10,970
Oh I don't like
it either but I...

703
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,310
Enough.

704
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:14,640
Give me your hand.

705
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:16,060
Your hand.

706
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,200
You are an agent

707
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,570
for the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense.

708
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,450
And your name is...

709
00:50:32,830 --> 00:50:33,830
Oh...

710
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:35,830
Horrible I know.

711
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,580
I'm Nuala
Princess Nuala.

712
00:50:39,130 --> 00:50:40,590
Yes I know.

713
00:50:40,670 --> 00:50:42,510
Forgive me
Your Highness

714
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:44,550
but as you were
learning about me

715
00:50:44,630 --> 00:50:47,800
I couldn't help
but learn a bit
about you myself.

716
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:51,010
I know that you
need our help.

717
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:53,140
I'm afraid it's
the other way around.

718
00:51:03,110 --> 00:51:04,530
The window. Out now.

719
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:05,950
I will take care of this.

720
00:51:06,030 --> 00:51:07,280
Oh dear.

721
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,390
Go! Now go!

722
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,700
Get out of here Blue.

723
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,620
Yes. Come with me
Your Highness.

724
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:53,700
You.

725
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,660
Let me put this to you
as delicately as I can.

726
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:07,630
My cigar it was Cuban.

727
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:10,220
Now you pissed me off.

728
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:20,770
Oh crap.

729
00:52:29,110 --> 00:52:30,110
Whoa!

730
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,600
Now stay down!

731
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:01,910
Damn.

732
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,420
A tooth. Happy?

733
00:54:13,470 --> 00:54:15,550
Give it up pal.
It's over.

734
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:19,310
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

735
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:34,570
Wow. Told you.

736
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:46,920
Oh mein Gott
what have you done
Agent Hellboy?

737
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,830
Look at this!
Now we have to leave.

738
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,500
Red. This is Princess Nuala.

739
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,670
Lady.

740
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,010
We should leave.
Now. Now!

741
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,380
Let's go.

742
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,970
To wage his war
my brother needs this

743
00:55:37,050 --> 00:55:39,300
the final piece of
the Crown of Bethmoora

744
00:55:39,390 --> 00:55:41,800
and this map to the location
of the Golden Army chamber.

745
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:43,970
The Golden Army.

746
00:55:44,060 --> 00:55:45,680
The harbingers of death.

747
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,390
The unstoppable tide.

748
00:55:48,230 --> 00:55:49,230
Howdy Doody.

749
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,020
Your Highness if you hand
the crown piece over to us...

750
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,320
No. Where it goes I go.

751
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,700
My father died to uphold
the truce with your world.

752
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,490
You must honor
his noble intention.

753
00:55:59,570 --> 00:56:00,820
The lady's
in dire danger.

754
00:56:00,910 --> 00:56:03,530
I take it you're
vouching for her
Agent Sapien?

755
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:06,120
Most emphatically.
Yes I am.

756
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,410
Even so.

757
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,000
I am sorry but we
simply cannot assume

758
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:13,090
such responsibility
on our own.

759
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,500
The lady just
lost her father.

760
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:15,920
What more do you want?

761
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:19,220
You may not care
but there are
procedures rules

762
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,800
and little handbooks...

763
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:22,300
She's coming with us.

764
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:23,470
You got that Gas Bag?

765
00:56:23,550 --> 00:56:24,600
What did you call me?

766
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,100
You.

767
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:31,060
You will pay
for what happened
to my friend down there.

768
00:56:31,150 --> 00:56:33,360
Yeah right.
You take checks?

769
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:34,690
Demon.

770
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:36,070
Born from a womb of shadows.

771
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,990
Sent to destroy their
world and you still
believe you belong.

772
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:40,530
Are we gonna
talk all night?

773
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:42,280
'Cause I'm really sleepy.

774
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:47,330
No Brother no!

775
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:00,920
Kill him.

776
00:57:11,810 --> 00:57:13,480
It's just a jumping bean.

777
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,400
It's going for water. Hurry.

778
00:57:19,150 --> 00:57:20,150
Oh dear.

779
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,820
No. No no no no. No.

780
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:55,020
What the hell is that?
Excuse me!

781
00:57:56,770 --> 00:57:59,190
Stay back.
Hey what's going on?

782
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:28,300
{i1}We've got{i0}
{i1}target in sight.{i0}

783
00:58:29,640 --> 00:58:31,640
It's an Elemental

784
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,810
a giver of life
and a destroyer.

785
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:34,980
What?

786
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:36,270
A Forest God.

787
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,520
A Forest God eh?

788
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:43,650
I'm gonna get me Big Baby.

789
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:55,120
Somebody help!
My baby's...
Help! Help!

790
00:58:55,620 --> 00:58:56,790
How can I help you ma'am?

791
00:58:56,870 --> 00:58:58,630
My baby's inside!

792
00:58:58,710 --> 00:59:00,540
Come with us
dear lady please.

793
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:02,090
There's nothing
to worry about.

794
00:59:02,170 --> 00:59:03,590
We've got everything
under control.

795
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,760
Please. My baby's
still in there! Please!

796
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:21,650
Hey little guy.

797
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,420
{i1}Homing in on target.{i0}

798
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:44,800
Hang on kid.

799
00:59:55,430 --> 00:59:56,480
Agent Hellboy.

800
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,810
Reach higher ground
and shoot the weapon.

801
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,310
Shoot the weapon!

802
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,660
First praise the tail kid.

803
01:00:35,140 --> 01:00:37,270
You must shoot it in
the energy ganglion.

804
01:00:37,350 --> 01:00:38,390
The what?

805
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:39,430
The energy ganglion.

806
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:42,400
Scheisse. The head!
Shoot it in the head!

807
01:00:43,150 --> 01:00:44,150
Whoa!

808
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:55,530
Oh crap.

809
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:02,870
You gotta trust me
little buddy. Okay?

810
01:01:13,890 --> 01:01:15,720
You woke up the baby.

811
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,000
Agent Hellboy
take the shot!

812
01:01:45,080 --> 01:01:47,000
Right now! Take it!

813
01:01:47,090 --> 01:01:49,050
That's an order!
Take the shot.

814
01:01:49,170 --> 01:01:51,170
That's an order
Agent Hellboy.

815
01:01:51,260 --> 01:01:55,840
Shoot it!
Shoot the gun!
Shoot the gun!

816
01:01:59,430 --> 01:02:00,930
Demon.

817
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:03,310
What are you waiting for?

818
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,520
This is what you
wanted isn't it?

819
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:08,650
Look at it.
It's the last
of its kind.

820
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,530
Like you and I.
You destroy it

821
01:02:15,610 --> 01:02:17,950
the world will never
see its like again.

822
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,080
Shoot it!

823
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,620
You have more
in common with us
than with them.

824
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:26,920
It's breaking free.

825
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,540
You could be a king.

826
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:30,210
You will not
disobey a direct order!

827
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,050
Shoot it!
It's getting loose!

828
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:33,220
If you cannot command...

829
01:02:33,300 --> 01:02:34,380
It will
destroy everything!

830
01:02:34,470 --> 01:02:35,680
That's an order
Agent Hellboy!

831
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,890
...then you must obey.

832
01:02:36,970 --> 01:02:38,850
Shoot it now!
Damn.

833
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:41,470
Shoot it!

834
01:03:14,210 --> 01:03:18,010
Move back.
Step back step back.

835
01:03:53,090 --> 01:03:55,090
It's beautiful.

836
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:21,700
...and this huge
monster just came
out of nowhere!

837
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,960
Yo give the
baby back man!

838
01:04:33,750 --> 01:04:36,510
Oh what have you
done to my baby?

839
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:37,630
The baby's fine.

840
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:38,720
You freak!

841
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:39,970
Hellboy
what'd you do to that baby?

842
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:41,300
The baby's fine.

843
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,890
Don't move.
Hands in the air! Up!

844
01:04:43,970 --> 01:04:45,600
He's got a weapon
in his hand.

845
01:04:45,680 --> 01:04:47,640
That is his hand.

846
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,480
Miss stay away from him
for your own safety.

847
01:04:50,560 --> 01:04:52,650
He was trying to help.
Don't you see?

848
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:55,020
He was just trying to help.

849
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:58,400
That's all we do.

850
01:04:58,490 --> 01:04:59,950
That's all we've
done all these years.

851
01:05:00,030 --> 01:05:01,450
She's touching
his hand!

852
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,700
We've just tried to
help you. You.

853
01:05:06,280 --> 01:05:08,200
You're a goddamn freak.

854
01:05:08,790 --> 01:05:10,790
We don't need
you around!

855
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:25,430
What a freak.

856
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:26,600
Liz.

857
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,810
Let's go home.

858
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:42,030
{i1}...investigation of the{i0}
{i1}BPRD and its promotion of{i0}
{i1}intra-species marriage{i0}

859
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:45,320
{i1}seen by many as a threat{i0}
{i1}to traditional families{i0}

860
01:05:45,410 --> 01:05:47,240
{i1}fuelled by federal funds.{i0}

861
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:50,660
I didn't touch you yet.

862
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,710
You did a good job
out there.

863
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,720
Then tell me why
don't I feel so good?

864
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:07,260
I mean I killed that thing.
And for what?

865
01:06:09,010 --> 01:06:10,970
They don't even like me.

866
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:13,850
I mean they're afraid of me.

867
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:16,480
What do we do with that?

868
01:06:16,860 --> 01:06:19,900
Red I don't want
you to freak out.

869
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,650
I'm gonna leave
for a little bit.

870
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,450
I need time to think.

871
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:30,790
About what?

872
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:33,120
Can't you do your
thinking right here?

873
01:06:33,290 --> 01:06:35,210
Look I'll be really
really quiet.

874
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:37,210
I'll get rid of the cats.

875
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,880
Red why are you with me?

876
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,630
Do you need
everyone to like you?

877
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:47,930
Everybody?
Or am I enough?

878
01:06:49,050 --> 01:06:50,600
Think about it.

879
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:02,900
{i1}You stay.{i0}
{i1}We belong dead.{i0}

880
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:13,410
It's blank.
No coordinates.

881
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:29,260
"Be near me
when my light is low

882
01:07:29,340 --> 01:07:33,850
"When the blood
creeps and the nerves
prick and tingle

883
01:07:33,930 --> 01:07:38,600
"And the heart
is sick and all
the wheels of being slow

884
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:45,360
"Be near me when the sensuous
frame is wracked with
pangs that conquer trust

885
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:47,400
"And time a maniac..."

886
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:50,570
Tennyson
"In Memoriam."
A beautiful poem.

887
01:07:50,660 --> 01:07:52,330
Forgive me I didn't
mean to startle you.

888
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:54,620
Oh no. No no.
I borrowed this book.

889
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:55,750
I hope you don't mind.

890
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:58,790
Oh no no. Please
this is your home now.

891
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,130
You are safe here.

892
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,750
My brother will find me.
He always does.

893
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:03,960
How could he?

894
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,550
Our location is a highly
classified secret.

895
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:08,220
Yes but I know of
it now which means
that he does too.

896
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,590
We're twins.

897
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,260
Even as children
a link has bound us
one to the other.

898
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:15,680
Something I cannot explain.

899
01:08:16,140 --> 01:08:17,350
No need.

900
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,560
You look different.

901
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:22,940
Oh do I?

902
01:08:23,020 --> 01:08:24,230
Perhaps my hair?

903
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,400
No.

904
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:28,820
It's your eyes.
I can see your eyes.

905
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:33,160
Yes. Just trying
a new look.

906
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,120
Is that a map?

907
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,670
Yes it was in the cylinder.

908
01:08:42,790 --> 01:08:44,710
There are no coordinates.

909
01:08:48,470 --> 01:08:50,680
Perhaps there's
a watermark.

910
01:08:53,680 --> 01:08:56,680
You were very brave
vouching for me.

911
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:00,060
How do you know
I'm not the enemy
bringing me here?

912
01:09:01,190 --> 01:09:03,230
It's as you were
saying just now.

913
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:07,860
From intuition maybe
a link.

914
01:09:10,780 --> 01:09:13,870
Normally I'm
able to read others
quite quickly

915
01:09:14,870 --> 01:09:17,330
but I've never met
anyone like you.

916
01:09:19,870 --> 01:09:21,460
Nor I like you.

917
01:09:24,710 --> 01:09:26,630
Good night Abraham.

918
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:28,210
Good night Princess.
Your Highness.

919
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,130
Your Majesty.
Your... Ma'am.

920
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:31,880
Ma'am?

921
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,790
{i1}Gute Nacht{i0}
Agent Hellboy.

922
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:13,720
Look Agent
I know you don't like me

923
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,510
but I could take
away your badge.

924
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:17,510
Never had one.

925
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:19,720
Kept asking though.

926
01:10:19,810 --> 01:10:22,020
You will learn to
obey me follow protocol

927
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,190
and stay fockused
at all times.

928
01:10:24,270 --> 01:10:26,810
Oh that word "fockused."

929
01:10:26,900 --> 01:10:29,980
Yeah with your
accent I wouldn't
use it that much.

930
01:10:30,070 --> 01:10:32,030
I knew Professor Broom
young man.

931
01:10:32,110 --> 01:10:33,360
You didn't know
Professor Broom.

932
01:10:33,440 --> 01:10:34,570
Yes I did.

933
01:10:34,650 --> 01:10:36,030
After my accident...
Shut up. Shut up.

934
01:10:36,110 --> 01:10:37,700
...he designed
this containment suit.

935
01:10:37,780 --> 01:10:39,370
A wonderful man.

936
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:40,870
And even then
he was worried
about your future. He...

937
01:10:40,950 --> 01:10:42,790
Hey Gas Bag stop it!

938
01:10:44,620 --> 01:10:45,670
Right now.

939
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,000
Or what?
Are you threatening me?

940
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,550
Because I think
I can take you.

941
01:10:53,050 --> 01:10:54,170
Excuse me?

942
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,550
You heard me.

943
01:10:58,180 --> 01:11:01,260
I couldn't hear you
from all the way over there.

944
01:11:01,350 --> 01:11:05,140
I can take you
because you have
one fatal flaw.

945
01:11:06,140 --> 01:11:07,230
Oh I wanna hear it.

946
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:09,650
No you don't.
You can't take criticism.

947
01:11:09,730 --> 01:11:11,440
Try me.

948
01:11:11,570 --> 01:11:13,280
Can't take it.

949
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:17,570
What's my flaw?

950
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:20,580
Your temper.
It gets the best of you.

951
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:23,290
Makes you weak.
Makes you vulnerable.

952
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:28,370
Oh crap.

953
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:30,710
Johann.

954
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:38,510
Johann? Johann?

955
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:42,510
Hey Johann?

956
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,350
Come on pal.
Hang in there
will you?

957
01:11:49,440 --> 01:11:51,810
Johann? Johann?

958
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:56,990
Damn.

959
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:02,160
Ow!

960
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,660
There we are.

961
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:43,320
Your temper
it makes you sloppy.

962
01:12:43,410 --> 01:12:45,330
Try to control it
Agent Hellboy.

963
01:12:45,410 --> 01:12:47,330
Before it controls you.

964
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,090
Glasshole.

965
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:05,220
Mmm.

966
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:12,230
Huh?

967
01:13:28,620 --> 01:13:29,620
Hello Red.

968
01:13:29,700 --> 01:13:30,910
Well you're up late.

969
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,210
What are you listening to?

970
01:13:32,290 --> 01:13:35,250
Vivaldi.
{i1}ll cimento dell'armonia.{i0}

971
01:13:35,330 --> 01:13:36,710
I particularly
like the last...

972
01:13:36,790 --> 01:13:38,090
Hey hey. What's that?

973
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,840
Just a remote.

974
01:13:42,340 --> 01:13:44,180
This? Yes.

975
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,310
{i1}"Popular Love Songs."{i0}

976
01:13:51,520 --> 01:13:52,730
Oh Abe.

977
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:56,270
You fell for the Princess.

978
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,440
She's... She's like me.

979
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:01,860
A creature from
another world.

980
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,780
You need to get out more.

981
01:14:05,870 --> 01:14:08,830
She's alone in the world.
I wanna help her.

982
01:14:08,910 --> 01:14:11,120
I need to care for her.

983
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,420
You're in love.
Have a beer.

984
01:14:15,500 --> 01:14:16,500
Oh my body's a temple.

985
01:14:16,580 --> 01:14:17,630
Well now it's an
amusement park.

986
01:14:17,710 --> 01:14:18,710
No no no.

987
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:19,750
The glandular balance of...

988
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,050
Just shut up and
drink it would you?

989
01:14:24,800 --> 01:14:26,890
What track?
Eight.

990

991
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,930
I know.

992
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:32,980
Yep I'm gonna need
a beer too.

993
01:14:33,060 --> 01:14:35,310
Well see I love this song.

994
01:14:35,390 --> 01:14:38,020
And I can't smile or cry.

995
01:14:38,110 --> 01:14:40,400
I think I have
no tear ducts.

996
01:14:43,280 --> 01:14:45,780
I wish Father were here.

997
01:14:45,860 --> 01:14:48,950
He'd know what to tell
you. Us.

998
01:14:56,870 --> 01:15:01,210

1000
01:15:06,590 --> 01:15:10,300
{i1}l'm finding it hard{i0}
{i1}to do anything{i0}

1001
01:15:10,390 --> 01:15:16,310
{i1}You see{i0}

{i1}you're sad{i0}

{i1}smile without you{i0}

1005
01:15:36,250 --> 01:15:38,460
{i1}You came along{i0}

1006
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,750
{i1}Just like a song{i0}

1007
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:44,050
{i1}And brightened my day{i0}

1008
01:15:44,130 --> 01:15:48,430
{i1}Who'd have believed{i0}
{i1}that you were{i0}
{i1}part of a dream?{i0}

1009
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:53,850
{i1}Now it all seems{i0}
{i1}light years away{i0}

1010
01:15:53,930 --> 01:16:00,100
{i1}And now you know l can't{i0}
{i1}smile without you{i0}

1011
01:16:01,270 --> 01:16:05,280
{i1}l can't smile without you{i0}

1012
01:16:06,780 --> 01:16:08,240
{i1}Nuala.{i0}

1013
01:16:18,460 --> 01:16:19,750
Good dog.

1014

{i1}immediately.{i0}

1015
01:16:52,490 --> 01:16:54,240
It's the last one.

1016
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:02,920
Look at her.
She's it Abe.

1017
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,500
She's it.

1018
01:17:04,670 --> 01:17:06,590
She's my whole wide...

1019
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:09,880
You know?

1020
01:17:11,510 --> 01:17:13,550
Yeah. Yeah.

1021
01:17:13,640 --> 01:17:16,010
I would give
my life for her.

1022
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:20,480
But she also wants me
to do the dishes.

1023
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:25,190
I would die
and do the dishes.

1024
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,280
Why is she mad at me?

1025
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,940
It's not because
the room is dirty.

1026
01:17:29,030 --> 01:17:30,610
Something else.

1027
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:34,160
Well ask her then.

1028
01:17:34,240 --> 01:17:36,160
No.

1029
01:17:36,410 --> 01:17:37,790
Listen Abe.

1030
01:17:37,870 --> 01:17:38,830
Yeah.

1031
01:17:38,910 --> 01:17:40,830
When a woman's
mad about something

1032
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,790
but she's really mad
about something else

1033
01:17:42,870 --> 01:17:46,710
you can't ask because
then they get angry
because you had to ask.

1034
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:48,210
Do you know what I mean?

1035
01:17:48,300 --> 01:17:50,630
Never mind
don't answer
that question.

1036
01:17:50,720 --> 01:17:52,430
You gotta just...

1037
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:54,390
Yeah.

1038
01:17:55,390 --> 01:17:56,550
...find out.

1039
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,400
Very quick of you.
The parchment.

1040
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:07,230
It was of no importance.

1041
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:12,030
The cylinder is
very interesting.

1042
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:19,540
We will find
the Golden Army here.

1043
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:24,580
As for the crown piece
I know it's here.

1044
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,550
I can feel that
much from you.

1045
01:18:30,920 --> 01:18:34,630
Father always tried
so hard to shield your
heart from mine.

1046
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:41,270
But it's in one of the books
and I will find it.

1047
01:18:41,720 --> 01:18:42,930
Blue.

1048
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:46,020
You always look
so beautiful in blue.

1049
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:48,560
Blue.

1050
01:18:49,610 --> 01:18:51,780
Poetry. "Love.

1051
01:18:52,860 --> 01:18:55,570
"Found then lost."

1052
01:18:57,110 --> 01:18:59,620
Only words.
I will find it.

1053
01:19:01,540 --> 01:19:03,080
Listen listen Red.

1054
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:06,540
I know what's
going on with Liz.

1055
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:08,040
Red.

1056
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:09,670
Abe.

1057
01:19:11,130 --> 01:19:12,250
I'm sorry.
He has to know.

1058
01:19:12,340 --> 01:19:13,420
Abe!

1059
01:19:13,510 --> 01:19:14,880
Know what?

1060
01:19:20,260 --> 01:19:21,560
Why?

1061
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:23,430
Stay back.
I'll go first.

1062
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:27,060
Abraham. No don't...
He'll kill you.

1063
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,480
Princess?

1064
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:29,900
Abraham?

1065
01:19:31,940 --> 01:19:33,320
No!

1066
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,190
I will kill you Abraham.

1067
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:39,120
And anyone else
if that is necessary.

1068
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:42,540
Well?

1069
01:19:43,790 --> 01:19:48,830
Then why don't you
just start with me
Your Royal Assness?

1070
01:19:48,920 --> 01:19:50,330
Whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1071
01:19:50,420 --> 01:19:51,790
Who put those there?

1072
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,460
And your weapon of choice?

1073
01:19:53,550 --> 01:19:56,050
Five-fingered Mary.

1074
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:59,390
You move and I'll kill
your Abraham first.

1075
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,150
Red you mustn't
harm the Prince.

1076
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:13,360
What?

1077
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,190
If you hurt him
you hurt the Princess.

1078
01:20:17,570 --> 01:20:19,860
You've gotta be kidding me.

1079
01:20:24,910 --> 01:20:26,040
Will you give me
the crown piece?

1080
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:27,370
No.

1081
01:20:37,380 --> 01:20:39,050
The piece.
No.

1082
01:21:09,250 --> 01:21:10,250
Abe?

1083
01:21:10,330 --> 01:21:11,580
Red I'm so sorry
but they're linked.

1084
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:12,880
What's going on?

1085
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,500
Red.
Liz.

1086
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:16,380
Red behind you.

1087
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:21,880
You may have
mused in the past
"Am I mortal?"

1088
01:21:27,470 --> 01:21:28,890
You are now.

1089
01:21:35,480 --> 01:21:39,240
Abraham
many people have
died for this crown.

1090
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:42,610
He will too.

1091
01:21:43,820 --> 01:21:48,700
If you want to save him
and see her again

1092
01:21:49,790 --> 01:21:53,330
you will find
the missing piece
and bring it to me.

1093
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:32,580
Jesus Abe pull the
damn thing out!

1094
01:22:32,660 --> 01:22:33,910
I cannot.

1095
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:37,330
Every time I touch it
every time I
come close to it

1096
01:22:37,420 --> 01:22:39,380
it moves closer
to his heart.

1097
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,170
I don't know
what else to do.

1098
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,550
The wound will not heal
until the spear is removed.

1099
01:22:46,890 --> 01:22:48,260
We're running out of time.

1100
01:22:48,350 --> 01:22:50,180
Then we go after the Prince.

1101
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,850
And we make him
take it out.

1102
01:22:55,770 --> 01:22:57,100
Hey Liz.

1103
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,650
You were asking me.

1104
01:22:58,730 --> 01:22:59,860
Don't talk.

1105
01:22:59,940 --> 01:23:01,480
No no let me tell you.

1106
01:23:01,570 --> 01:23:03,280
I know what's important.

1107
01:23:05,200 --> 01:23:06,280
It's you.

1108
01:23:06,360 --> 01:23:07,780
Red.

1109
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:11,490
I could turn my back
on the world all of it

1110
01:23:14,660 --> 01:23:16,330
as long as you stay with me.

1111
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:18,210
I'll stay with you.

1112
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:21,500
You're the best man
I've ever met.

1113
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:27,890
"Man."

1114
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,330
{i1}"Be near me{i0}
{i1}when my light is low{i0}

1115
01:23:57,410 --> 01:23:58,830
{i1}"When the blood creeps{i0}

1116
01:23:58,920 --> 01:24:03,920
{i1}"And the heart{i0}
{i1}is sick and all{i0}
{i1}the wheels of being slow"{i0}

1117
01:24:10,470 --> 01:24:12,140
The cylinder
yielded coordinates

1118
01:24:12,220 --> 01:24:14,350
to County Antrim
Northern Ireland.

1119
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:17,940
The Giant's Causeway.
Right about here.

1120
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,400
Great. So we know
where he is.

1121
01:24:21,480 --> 01:24:22,520
What are we waiting for?

1122
01:24:22,610 --> 01:24:23,690
We should get going.

1123
01:24:23,770 --> 01:24:26,650
The Prince will
demand the crown piece
Agent Sherman.

1124
01:24:26,740 --> 01:24:28,360
So we give it to him.

1125
01:24:28,450 --> 01:24:29,860
Dr. Manning?

1126
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:32,570
I'm afraid it's not
as simple as that.

1127
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,540
Hold on here
what are you saying?

1128
01:24:34,620 --> 01:24:36,950
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1129
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:39,670
So what?

1130
01:24:39,750 --> 01:24:42,080
You're just gonna let
him die is that it?

1131
01:24:42,170 --> 01:24:43,210
I'm sorry.

1132
01:24:43,290 --> 01:24:45,710
We called Washington.
We have our orders.

1133
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:49,050
And what about you?
He saved your life.

1134
01:24:49,130 --> 01:24:50,720
I know.

1135
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:55,810
I know this is
difficult for you but...

1136
01:24:55,890 --> 01:24:57,560
Well I won't
let him die.

1137
01:24:57,640 --> 01:24:59,350
Agent Sherman
may I remind you

1138
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:02,400
that I am the leader
of this team.

1139
01:25:02,480 --> 01:25:04,190
Oh there's no doubt
about that sir.

1140
01:25:04,270 --> 01:25:06,190
That is what you
are Dr. Krauss.

1141
01:25:06,280 --> 01:25:10,150
And if ever you were human
that time is long gone.

1142
01:25:11,660 --> 01:25:13,570
What's wrong
with her?

1143
01:25:13,660 --> 01:25:14,830
You want me to
call her back sir?

1144
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,160
Let her go.

1145
01:25:16,330 --> 01:25:17,790
I understand.

1146
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,540
What about you?

1147
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,040
You find anything?

1148
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,500
No. Nothing yet.

1149
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,040
Well keep looking.

1150
01:25:25,130 --> 01:25:26,500
Absolutely sir.

1151
01:25:26,590 --> 01:25:28,300
All of you.

1152
01:25:28,380 --> 01:25:31,260
But don't worry
sir we know it's here
and we're gonna find it.

1153
01:25:31,340 --> 01:25:33,430
When Tom Manning
gets on the case
things get done.

1154
01:25:33,510 --> 01:25:35,760
They get done.
They get done!

1155
01:25:36,350 --> 01:25:39,270
100%. I guarantee that.

1156
01:25:55,030 --> 01:25:59,120
Even without the piece
we have to get
him out of here.

1157
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:02,080
We'll go to
Antrim and we will
find the Prince.

1158
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,330
Keep looking.

1159
01:26:03,420 --> 01:26:04,460
I ask you everybody
keep looking.

1160
01:26:04,540 --> 01:26:05,540
Abe.

1161
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,960
Just the two of us.

1162
01:26:11,670 --> 01:26:13,510
Yes. Yes.

1163
01:26:14,130 --> 01:26:15,430
Let's go.

1164
01:26:31,740 --> 01:26:35,110
We need to leave now
before they run our
clearance upstairs.

1165
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:37,660
{i1}Guten Abend{i0}
{i1}meine Freunde.{i0}

1166
01:26:37,740 --> 01:26:40,290
Do you have authorization
to take that plane?

1167
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,750
You're not gonna
stop us Johann.

1168
01:26:43,830 --> 01:26:46,290
On the contrary
I've been giving
it some thought

1169
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:49,340
and we should be able
to save Agent Hellboy.

1170
01:26:50,130 --> 01:26:53,670
You say I'm not
human anymore
but you are wrong.

1171
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,390
I understand your
pain all too well.

1172
01:26:56,470 --> 01:26:59,430
A long time ago
I lost the woman I loved.

1173
01:26:59,510 --> 01:27:03,060
And that was in fact
the source of my
present misfortune.

1174
01:27:03,140 --> 01:27:04,770
I will tell you
about it one day.

1175
01:27:04,850 --> 01:27:07,770
But for now the tactical
advantage is ours.

1176
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:10,690
Consider this
the Prince lacks
the crown piece

1177
01:27:10,770 --> 01:27:13,360
and without it
his army poses
no threat.

1178
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:14,860
So we have clearance then?

1179
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:18,570
Agent Sherman Liz
screw the clearance.

1180
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,200
We will take that plane!

1181
01:27:45,180 --> 01:27:46,890
It should be here someplace.

1182
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:50,980
The entrance should be here.

1183
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:52,400
I don't understand.

1184
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:55,070
Perhaps there's
a mistake on the map.

1185
01:28:00,370 --> 01:28:01,870
Hello there!

1186
01:28:03,910 --> 01:28:05,500
I bid you welcome strangers.

1187
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,080
How can I be of assistance?

1188
01:28:07,160 --> 01:28:09,290
We seek safe
passage to Bethmoora.

1189
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,880
And what does a nice
little girl like you
want in the nightlands?

1190
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:14,760
We are looking
for Prince Nuada.

1191
01:28:14,840 --> 01:28:16,300
Him I know.

1192
01:28:16,380 --> 01:28:18,550
Trade me something
and I'll take you to him.

1193
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:20,970
Here. I have a shiny belt.

1194
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:23,430
But I have no pants.

1195
01:28:23,510 --> 01:28:26,560
Look a wonderful
set of magic eyes.

1196
01:28:26,640 --> 01:28:28,690
I already have binoculars.

1197
01:28:29,690 --> 01:28:34,650
But I see something special
something shiny
underneath the bandages.

1198
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:36,190
I want that.

1199
01:28:36,280 --> 01:28:37,900
No you can't take it out.

1200
01:28:37,990 --> 01:28:40,030
Not without killing him.

1201
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,240
Maybe I know someone
who can.

1202
01:28:43,330 --> 01:28:45,040
Will you trade me then?

1203
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,000
All right.

1204
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,340
Very well.

1205
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:07,120
Keep going. Keep going.

1206
01:30:21,300 --> 01:30:22,970
Oh my God.

1207
01:30:34,980 --> 01:30:38,150
You should have
seen this city
when it was alive.

1208
01:30:40,530 --> 01:30:41,900
What happened to it?

1209
01:30:41,990 --> 01:30:42,990
Curse.

1210
01:30:43,070 --> 01:30:45,320
As soon as
the Golden Army
was stored here

1211
01:30:45,410 --> 01:30:47,910
a plague of silence
and death befell us.

1212
01:30:47,990 --> 01:30:50,290
And the world left us behind.

1213
01:30:57,500 --> 01:31:00,420
For a long time
I alone dwelled in the dust.

1214
01:31:03,670 --> 01:31:07,680
All right little girl
the two of you come inside.

1215
01:31:07,760 --> 01:31:10,060
The rest of you
wait out here.

1216
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:27,280
Hello old friend.

1217
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,200
I have brought you visitors.

1218
01:31:32,580 --> 01:31:35,580
And I have
a favor to ask you.

1219
01:31:35,660 --> 01:31:39,330
I owe no favor to
you goblin. Leave.

1220
01:31:39,420 --> 01:31:41,420
But I have done
so much for you.

1221
01:31:41,550 --> 01:31:43,670
I have brought
you many souvenirs.

1222
01:31:44,550 --> 01:31:46,680
And he has something shiny.

1223
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:47,930
Red.

1224
01:31:48,010 --> 01:31:49,140
Something mine.

1225
01:31:49,220 --> 01:31:50,220
Red!

1226
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:58,230
Anung un Rama.

1227
01:31:58,310 --> 01:31:59,350
You know that name?

1228
01:31:59,440 --> 01:32:04,150
And yours.
Elizabeth Sherman.

1229
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:12,620
At last.

1230
01:32:12,740 --> 01:32:18,710
I have been
waiting for you both
many a winter moon.

1231
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:24,840
I am his death

1232
01:32:24,920 --> 01:32:29,760
and I will meet him
at each crossroads.

1233
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,760
Good. But when can I have
that which is mine?

1234
01:32:33,970 --> 01:32:35,350
Can you save him?

1235
01:32:35,430 --> 01:32:37,890
It is for you to decide that.

1236
01:32:37,980 --> 01:32:39,900
It is all the same to me.

1237
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:45,110
My heart is filled
with dust and sand

1238
01:32:45,190 --> 01:32:49,490
but you should know
it is his destiny

1239
01:32:50,660 --> 01:32:53,830
to bring about the
destruction of the Earth.

1240
01:32:54,910 --> 01:33:01,330
Not now not tomorrow
but soon enough.

1241
01:33:06,050 --> 01:33:11,430
Knowing that you still
want him to live?

1242
01:33:20,140 --> 01:33:24,560
So child make the choice.

1243
01:33:24,650 --> 01:33:28,190
The world or him?

1244
01:33:28,820 --> 01:33:29,990
Him.

1245
01:33:31,820 --> 01:33:36,450
The time will come
and you my dear

1246
01:33:36,530 --> 01:33:39,790
will suffer more than anyone.

1247
01:33:39,870 --> 01:33:41,670
I'll deal with it.

1248
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:44,920
Now save him.

1249
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:48,590
It is done.

1250
01:33:53,470 --> 01:33:55,720
I have done what I can.

1251
01:33:55,850 --> 01:34:00,850
Now give him
a reason to live.

1252
01:34:05,650 --> 01:34:10,030
Hey friend what
about that which is mine?

1253
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:13,820
Don't forget about me.
What about me?

1254
01:34:13,910 --> 01:34:15,240
Friend?

1255
01:34:25,540 --> 01:34:26,710
Shiny.

1256
01:34:32,090 --> 01:34:35,300
Listen to me you big ape.

1257
01:34:37,220 --> 01:34:39,510
You have to get up.

1258
01:34:42,270 --> 01:34:44,060
You have to get up.

1259
01:34:46,730 --> 01:34:49,150
'Cause you're
gonna be a father.

1260
01:35:07,040 --> 01:35:08,710
I become

1261
01:35:11,340 --> 01:35:12,340
father?

1262
01:35:24,480 --> 01:35:27,270
Well all this is
very touching

1263
01:35:27,350 --> 01:35:32,360
but if you still
want to meet Nuada
we have to leave now.

1264
01:35:33,230 --> 01:35:34,280
Ready.

1265
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:43,660
Here we are.

1266
01:35:45,290 --> 01:35:47,670
And there they are.

1267
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:51,090
Seventy times 70 soldiers.

1268
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:54,670
Sometimes I wish
I'd never created them.

1269
01:35:54,760 --> 01:35:56,340
Bim-bam went the hammers!

1270
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:58,050
Whoosh went the furnaces!

1271
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:01,760
And one of those fires
took my legs off now.

1272
01:36:01,850 --> 01:36:04,680
This is as far as I can go.

1273
01:36:04,770 --> 01:36:07,310
I'm not very
good with steps.

1274
01:36:07,390 --> 01:36:12,230
But if you're here to
stop him the Prince
I wish you luck then.

1275
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,320
The Golden Army
must not awaken.

1276
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:15,570
Undo what we did.

1277
01:36:15,650 --> 01:36:16,650
We will.

1278
01:36:36,050 --> 01:36:37,220
You're here.

1279
01:36:37,300 --> 01:36:39,430
So I assume you brought
the remaining piece.

1280
01:36:39,510 --> 01:36:41,340
No. We didn't
but we should discuss...

1281
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:43,720
I'm not addressing you
Tin Man.

1282
01:36:44,810 --> 01:36:45,890
Abraham.

1283
01:36:45,970 --> 01:36:47,060
Abraham?

1284
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:48,310
My sister is well
as I promised so...

1285
01:36:48,390 --> 01:36:50,100
Abe?

1286
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:55,230
What the hell are you doing?

1287
01:36:55,360 --> 01:36:57,530
You would do
the exact same for Liz.

1288
01:36:57,610 --> 01:36:59,280
Agent Sapien no!

1289
01:37:21,630 --> 01:37:25,140
I am Prince Nuada
Silverlance

1290
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:27,220
leader of the Golden Army.

1291
01:37:28,770 --> 01:37:31,980
Is there anyone here
who would dispute my right?

1292
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:52,230
Kill them.

1293
01:38:52,310 --> 01:38:53,390
But...

1294
01:38:54,810 --> 01:38:56,350
He lied to us.

1295
01:38:58,310 --> 01:39:02,030
Abe old buddy
if we ever get out of
this we gotta talk.

1296
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:31,600
Open wide!

1297
01:39:41,320 --> 01:39:43,360
Industrable my ass.

1298
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:25,690
Hey! Throw me a bone here!

1299
01:42:05,330 --> 01:42:06,670
Oh crap.

1300
01:42:10,010 --> 01:42:11,880
Well
I'm out of ideas.

1301
01:42:20,140 --> 01:42:21,640
I got one.

1302
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:25,610
I challenge Prince Nuada

1303
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:30,780
for the right to
command this army.

1304
01:42:36,570 --> 01:42:38,910
You challenge me?

1305
01:42:38,990 --> 01:42:40,500
Who are you
to challenge me?

1306
01:42:40,580 --> 01:42:42,040
You are nobody.

1307
01:42:42,910 --> 01:42:44,370
You are not royalty.

1308
01:42:44,460 --> 01:42:48,710
Yes. Yes!
He is Anung un Rama
son of the Fallen One.

1309
01:42:48,800 --> 01:42:49,840
He has the right.

1310
01:42:49,920 --> 01:42:51,760
A challenge must
be answered.

1311
01:42:55,380 --> 01:42:56,890
Very well then.

1312
01:42:56,970 --> 01:42:58,140
Red please.
Red. Think about it.

1313
01:42:58,220 --> 01:42:59,220
Guys. Guys!
He will kill you.

1314
01:42:59,310 --> 01:43:01,060
Don't do this Red.

1315
01:43:01,850 --> 01:43:03,980
Don't worry babe.

1316
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,270
I'm not gonna kill him Abe.

1317
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,900
But I am gonna
kick his ass.

1318
01:44:39,860 --> 01:44:40,870
Whoa!

1319
01:45:16,480 --> 01:45:17,570
Red.

1320
01:45:19,200 --> 01:45:20,200
Hey!

1321
01:45:28,540 --> 01:45:29,870
Nice ride huh?

1322
01:46:09,870 --> 01:46:12,080
You jumpy slippery bastard.

1323
01:46:13,330 --> 01:46:14,580
I got you now.

1324
01:46:24,260 --> 01:46:27,850
Kill me. You must
for I will not stop.

1325
01:46:27,930 --> 01:46:29,520
I cannot.
Sorry pal.

1326
01:46:30,890 --> 01:46:32,060
I win.

1327
01:46:33,020 --> 01:46:34,270
You live.

1328
01:47:05,090 --> 01:47:06,260
Nuala.

1329
01:47:34,710 --> 01:47:36,040
The humans

1330
01:47:38,750 --> 01:47:41,090
they will tire of you.

1331
01:47:41,170 --> 01:47:43,010
They have already
turned against you.

1332
01:47:43,510 --> 01:47:44,670
Leave them.

1333
01:47:46,220 --> 01:47:48,890
Is it them or us?

1334
01:47:52,060 --> 01:47:54,480
Which holocaust
should be chosen?

1335
01:48:05,690 --> 01:48:09,620
I never had a chance
to tell you how I felt.

1336
01:48:10,870 --> 01:48:12,540
Give me your hand.

1337
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:25,210
It's beautiful.

1338
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,630
We die

1339
01:48:29,840 --> 01:48:32,470
and the world will
be poorer for it.

1340
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:48,740
Nuala my sister.

1341
01:49:32,700 --> 01:49:33,780
All that power.

1342
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:35,620
Don't even think about it.

1343
01:50:24,880 --> 01:50:26,420
No. No it's nothing.

1344
01:50:26,500 --> 01:50:28,340
I told you
it's a dead end.

1345
01:50:28,800 --> 01:50:31,130
What are you doing?
Go away.

1346
01:50:31,220 --> 01:50:33,130
Check the belt locator.

1347
01:50:34,220 --> 01:50:36,890
Check the belt locators
over there.

1348
01:50:38,810 --> 01:50:40,310
Over there.

1349
01:50:43,980 --> 01:50:47,230
You you took that plane
without an authorization
young man.

1350
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:49,980
Hey. Manning.

1351
01:50:50,070 --> 01:50:52,150
Here to help as always.

1352
01:50:52,240 --> 01:50:54,660
What's going on?
What's going on?

1353
01:50:55,410 --> 01:50:56,660
I quit.

1354
01:50:57,620 --> 01:50:58,990
What? Are you serious?

1355
01:50:59,080 --> 01:51:00,450
Looks that way
doesn't it?

1356
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:03,330
What's wrong with you?
You can't all just quit.

1357
01:51:03,410 --> 01:51:04,750
Watch us.

1358
01:51:06,540 --> 01:51:08,210
On second thought

1359
01:51:09,880 --> 01:51:11,550
I think I'll keep this.

1360
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:15,380
Come on. Come on!

1361
01:51:16,720 --> 01:51:19,470
Johann they can't do this.
Stop them.

1362
01:51:19,560 --> 01:51:23,020
Dr. Manning suck my
ectoplasmic schwanzstucker.

1363
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:25,020
So what you said before

1364
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:26,480
about us living anywhere.

1365
01:51:26,560 --> 01:51:27,690
Guys. Guys!

1366
01:51:27,770 --> 01:51:29,900
Anywhere. You and me.
Come on back.

1367
01:51:29,980 --> 01:51:30,980
Let's find a place
in the country.

1368
01:51:31,070 --> 01:51:32,230
I said come on back.

1369
01:51:32,320 --> 01:51:34,360
Clean air.
Green hills.

1370
01:51:35,280 --> 01:51:38,820
A yard with lots
of room to grow in.

1371
01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:40,240
It'll be great
for the baby.

1372
01:51:40,330 --> 01:51:41,580
Babies.
