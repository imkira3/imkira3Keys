1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,650
We must begin our story, sad to say,
with an empty chair.

3
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,280
If it were not empty,
we would not have a story.

4
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:50,330
But it is, and we do, and
it is time to tell it.

5
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,060
This is the story of my family,

6
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,400
of my seven children,
who are all very clever

7
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:24,360
but all very, very, very naughty.

8
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,740
This is Nanny Whetstone,

9
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,080
the 17th nanny I had hired
to look after my children.

10
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,290
She was the strictest, the toughest

11
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:42,130
and the most fearless
nanny in all the land.

12
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,050
As I went to work that day
at the funeral parlour,

13
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,760
I was confident in the knowledge...

14
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,850
that there was nothing,
absolutely nothing

15
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:57,060
that my children could do to upset her.

16
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,310
They've eaten the baby!

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,860
Except that.

18
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,580
- Quick! He's coming!
- Hide!

19
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,790
- Quiet!
- Stop it!

20
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,110
Children, where's Aggy?

21
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,500
Look at you.

22
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,790
You're all cabbagey.

23
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,590
Oh...and you're all gravy-y.

24
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,510
As was your intention, Nanny Whetstone
has resigned from her post.

25
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,550
I shall go to the agency this afternoon
and hire a new nanny.

26
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,350
You will not drive her away
as you have done with her predecessors.

27
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:22,730
Papa.

28
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,070
Can't catch me out.
That showed 'em who's boss.

29
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:33,620
Three days, eight hours and 47 minutes.

30
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,080
So that got rid of her...

31
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:39,160
23 hours and 13 minutes
quicker than the last one.

32
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:43,920
I think the turning point was definitely
eating the baby. Well done, Eric.

33
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
Mr Brown, are you all right?

34
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,920
I'm perfectly all right.

35
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:55,510
Evangeline, could you let Cook know
that the new nanny has had to leave

36
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,720
and I'm off to the agency
to find a new one?

37
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:09,320
Good. I'll just...

38
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,500
- Mrs Partridge?
- We're closed.

39
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,050
- There's been a tiny hiccup.
- We're not here.

40
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,590
- Please, let me in...
- Go away.

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,260
Listen, they didn't eat the baby.
It was a chicken, actually.

42
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:39,060
There's no more nannies!
You've had the lot.

43
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,320
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

44
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:54,820
Is that you, Mrs Partridge?

45
00:04:55,870 --> 00:05:00,700
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

46
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,620
I need her to start right away.
I'm late for a vital tea dance.

47
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:07,540
Nanny McPhee is not on our books.

48
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:11,630
Nanny McPhee is not on anyone's books.

49
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,430
Nanny Whetstone's gone.

50
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,760
There's a surprise.
Hurry it up there. Spuds.

51
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:24,980
Mr Brown's gone to the agency.
I said the children'll be fine with us.

52
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,270
They won't be fine with me.

53
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,780
I won't have them dirty blighters
in my kitchen, and that is that!

54
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:34,700
I have it in writing. In writing!

55
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:41,790
- Well, that's the final straw.
- Pa!

56
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,080
There are no more nannies.

57
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,630
None. All over, finished.

58
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,130
I've had to cancel my appointment
and that will cause trouble.

59
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:56,340
- I told them not to. It wasn't my idea.
- Don't look at me! It's not my fault.

60
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,390
Well, you seem intent
on distressing me...

61
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,850
Er...don't do that, darling, please.
That's my sore bit.

62
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,650
You seem intent on distressing me,
so I'm going to distress you.

63
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,770
You are to...to go to bed immediately.

64
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,690
Before supper?

65
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,370
Without supper.

66
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,240
Did he say without supper?

67
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,870
Never mind that.

68
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,500
There's no more nannies.

69
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,960
Poor him...and poor them.

70
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,550
Poor them, my Aunt Fanny.

71
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,550
They're the worstest,
nastiest, horriblest...

72
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,050
It'll be snow in August
before this family's straightened out.

73
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:46,310
"Dear Nanny Whetstone,
I'm so very sorry."

74
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,980
"My children..."

75
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:52,440
Eric, give it back to her!
Give it back now! Stop it!

76
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:54,190
My children.

77
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,780
Eric! Eric, that's my teddy!

78
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:03,240
- Eric, stop doing this!
- Give it back!

79
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,410
- Stop fighting!
- Oi, you lot!

80
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,500
Quiet!

81
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:16,340
You're driving your poor father
to distraction. Stop it.

82
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,800
Lily, what's this word?

83
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,510
Lovingly."He took her
lovingly by the hand."

84
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,310
What's your book about, Evangeline?

85
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,770
It's about the daughter of a nice man
who remarries after his wife dies

86
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,770
and the stepmother's horrid to her.

87
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,400
Why doesn't the man
stop her being horrid?

88
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,570
Fathers all turn bad
once their wives die.

89
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,360
They don't care any more.

90
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,820
Simon. Yours does.

91
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,790
No, he doesn't.

92
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:50,960
Does he read to Chrissie
or play cricket with us like he used to?

93
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,500
He doesn't even sing Loola-bye to Aggy.
We hardly see him.

94
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,720
He loves you, Simon. You know that.
He's just had a lot on his mind since...

95
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:02,340
Since Mother died.

96
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,690
You used to be as close as anything.

97
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,770
Not any more. All he cares about now
is getting himself a nice new wife.

98
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,280
Well... I don't know
if that's true or not,

99
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,910
but it might be nice
to have a new mother.

100
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,080
Don't you know anything about the world?

101
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:32,790
Whoever he marries will be vile
and treat us like slaves.

102
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,590
- You don't know that.
- Plenty of hard evidence for it.

103
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,800
There isn't one stepmother in there
who's even halfway decent.

104
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,720
They're an evil breed. Anyway,
who ever likes other people's children?

105
00:08:46,970 --> 00:08:48,720
I like you.

106
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,270
Yes, but you're a servant.
You're paid to like us.

107
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,520
That doesn't count.

108
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,150
I've got my work to be getting on with.

109
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:06,570
I really am hungry, Evangeline.

110
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,700
Could you maybe bring me
some secret toast and jam?

111
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,290
All right, forget the jam.
Just some secret toast.

112
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,180
Shall I plump the cushion
on Mrs Brown's chair?

113
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:31,020
I know you like to plump it yourself
sometimes.

114
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:35,310
Oh, no, that's...that's all right.
You plump away, Evangeline. Thank you.

115
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:46,160
I was wondering if I might make
Master Sebastian a piece of toast.

116
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,620
Yes, I should think...
Er...no, under no circumstances. No.

117
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,700
I could do it secret-like.

118
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:55,500
No, they'll hear him chewing
and then we're done for.

119
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,210
No, they get nothing.

120
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,250
Righto, Mr Brown.

121
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:07,050
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

122
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,010
Nanny McPhee.

123
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:22,270
No supper.

124
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,690
Discipline. That's more like it.

125
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:54,390
Now, you listen here,
you pustular tykes.

126
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,690
You ain't allowed in this kitchen,
not now, not ever.

127
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,600
I have it in writing.

128
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,030
Well, dear, the agency
has closed its doors.

129
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,530
What am I to do? Aunt Adelaide says...

130
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,990
Your children are out
of control, Cedric.

131
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,450
And there was that thing she said...

132
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,250
about their needing a
female influence. I...

133
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,080
You know what she's like.
She'll stop the allowance

134
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:25,300
unless I marry again and give them
a new mother within the month.

135
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:30,800
A month. I mean, it's unbearable.
But l... I had to... I had to promise.

136
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:38,430
Remember we talked about
what would happen without her money.

137
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,980
The bank will take the house.

138
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:45,440
There'll be debtors' prison for me,
workhouse for the older children.

139
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,860
Goodness only knows
what'll happen to little Chrissie.

140
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,200
And as for Aggy...

141
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,740
it's unimaginable.

142
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:05,380
Where are you? You mewling half-bakes!

143
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:08,130
I'm ready for you. And I'm hard!

144
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,930
This is fun!

145
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,430
We got Cook!

146
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,110
The person you need is Nanny McPhee.

147
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,190
Jump!

148
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,200
Eric, you're not making another bomb,
are you?

149
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,030
McPhee...

150
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:39,450
Jump!

151
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,040
- Oh!
- Jump!

152
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:49,710
- They're in the kitchen.
- No! No! You took them down for toast!

153
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,760
I never did!
You sent them to bed with no dinner.

154
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,390
- That's what done it!
- Don't tell...

155
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,690
- I'll, er...
- Why don't you...?

156
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,570
- I'll go.
- No, I'd better...

157
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:10,610
- Well, no, I can...
- You, erm... I'll...

158
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,660
- I'll be off, then.
- Yes, you... I'll just...

159
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:48,810
Good evening, Mr Brown.
I am Nanny McPhee.

160
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,570
Oh, you're... Er...of course.

161
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:56,070
Good heavens. I suppose the agency...

162
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,660
I do not belong to any agency, Mr Brown.
I am a government nanny.

163
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,700
A government nanny? How...

164
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:06,420
.. unusual.

165
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:08,250
May I come in?

166
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,840
Yes, by all means, do...do come in.

167
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,430
I understand you have
extremely ill-behaved children.

168
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,480
No. No, no. No.
No... Good grief, what a suggestion.

169
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,150
- Playful.
- Shut up!

170
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,320
What are your main concerns?

171
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,690
Concerns?

172
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,740
Mm. Do they go to bed when they're told?

173
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:38,410
Well, no, not, er... No.

174
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,660
- Do they get up when they're told?
- Er...well, no, not exactly.

175
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,500
- Get dressed when they're told?
- Now, that's a good question.

176
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:51,590
- Do they say "please" and "thank you"?
- In what context?

177
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:55,300
That will do to be going on with.

178
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:59,390
Your children need me.

179
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,430
I'll go and make sure everything's
in order before I introduce you.

180
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,480
I shall introduce myself.

181
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:10,100
Please, Mr Brown,
go back to your newspaper.

182
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,340
Oh, look.

183
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:38,220
The door's open and
there's nobody there.

184
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,600
I am here.

185
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,220
I am Nanny McPhee.

186
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,140
Oh, did...did somebody speak?

187
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,400
- I didn't hear anything.
- That's because nobody's there.

188
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,990
Then listen carefully
and try to hear this.

189
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,490
Stop what you are doing,
put the kitchen to rights

190
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,490
and go upstairs to bed.

191
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:13,130
- Did you hear what I said?
- I've just had an idea.

192
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,760
Why don't we play here
in the kitchen all night long?

193
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,220
Let's, let's!

194
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,600
- Excellent notion.
- Tomatoes!

195
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,480
Jump! Jump, jump! Jump!

196
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:34,480
Jump, jump, jump, jump!

197
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,570
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

198
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,110
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!

199
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,280
Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump...jump...

200
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,240
jump.

201
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,640
Government nanny?

202
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:10,140
What's she done?

203
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,440
- She's done something to us!
- They went in the pot!

204
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,150
I can't stop!

205
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,940
She banged her stick!

206
00:17:18,190 --> 00:17:20,150
I'm going to be sick!

207
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,410
- It must be magic!
- What's happening?

208
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,370
- Please, Simon, let's stop!
- We've got to stop!

209
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,170
- Let's stop!
- Let's stop!

210
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:44,380
- Well, stop if you want, then!
- We can't!

211
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:45,840
It's her fault!

212
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,930
It started when she banged the stick!

213
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:51,720
- I can't stop!
- Slow down!

214
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:53,770
Simon!

215
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:57,480
Come on, whoever you are!
Let's stop this and go to bed!

216
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,230
- Say "please".
- I never say "please".

217
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,530
Very well.

218
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,110
- Please!
- Please!

219
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,120
- Don't touch Aggy!
- Wait!

220
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,040
Say it!

221
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,460
Actually, Simon, would you,
because this baby's gonna blow!

222
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:18,670
- And Aggy's gonna go in the stockpot!
- Put her back, Chrissie!

223
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,380
Oh, for goodness' sake! Please, then!

224
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:28,050
Take Aggy off me!

225
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:31,180
Please, Nanny McPhee.

226
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,600
Chrissie, don't!

227
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:39,150
- Say it!
- Take Aggy out!

228
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,070
- No, Lily!
- Say it!

229
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,980
Simon!

230
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,990
I can't stop myself!

231
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,620
Please, Nanny McPhee.

232
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:53,910
I'm going to jump!

233
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,500
Too late!

234
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,260
Blimey.

235
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:14,600
Up to bed, please.

236
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:30,780
Goodnight, Mrs Blatherwick.
Goodnight, Evangeline.

237
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:33,370
Goodnight, Nanny McPhee.

238
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:38,710
When Mr Brown said no dinner,
I thought they'd be down in a trice.

239
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,580
They've been ever so quiet.

240
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:44,710
Don't you fret.
They don't dare come in this kitchen.

241
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,550
I have it in writing.

242
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,470
Be careful, Aggy.

243
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,180
It's Mama's rattle,

244
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,600
and it's the only thing
we've got of hers.

245
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,520
- What on earth are you doing?
- Getting ready for bed.

246
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:08,780
- What she told us to do.
- Since when did we do what we're told?

247
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,820
Since we nearly got Cook blown up
and Aggy boiled.

248
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:18,660
May I just remind you of something?
We got rid of the last 17 nannies.

249
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:21,080
We're getting rid of this one too.

250
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:26,050
Fine! Be brave, then!

251
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:31,300
Yes, well, I nearly got blown up!
And anyway, l...

252
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:39,180
Hm.

253
00:20:56,530 --> 00:21:00,500
You must feel at such a disadvantage,
Nanny McPhee.

254
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,910
In what way?

255
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,040
We know your name
but you don't know ours.

256
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,840
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Oglington Fartworthy.

257
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:22,440
How do you do?

258
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,650
That's F-A-R-T.

259
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,610
Fartworthy.

260
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,200
Booger McHorsefanny.

261
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,660
Knickers O'Muffin.

262
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,120
Sandra.

263
00:21:39,370 --> 00:21:40,410
Bum.

264
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,830
I'm Bum!

265
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,830
Oh. Bosoms.

266
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,630
Bum.

267
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:54,220
You can't be Bum, Aggy.
Sebastian's Bum. You're Poop.

268
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,760
Poop Bum.

269
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,100
You can't be Poop and Bum.

270
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,910
Goodnight, Agatha.

271
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,840
Goodnight, Sebastian.

272
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,130
Goodnight, Tora.

273
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,420
Goodnight, Christianna.

274
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,970
Goodnight, Lily.

275
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,100
Goodnight, Eric.

276
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,690
Goodnight, Simon.

277
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,860
There is something you should understand
about the way I work.

278
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:01,490
When you need me but do not want me,
then I must stay.

279
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:07,870
When you want me but no longer need me,
then I have to go.

280
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:15,210
It's rather sad,
really, but there it is.

281
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,260
We will never want you.

282
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,970
Then I will never go.

283
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,900
Goodnight, children.

284
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:37,740
How did she know our names?
No one ever knows our names.

285
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,780
- Magic.
- Witchcraft.

286
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:43,870
It doesn't matter.
We're getting rid of her tomorrow.

287
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:57,720
What? Wha... What? What?

288
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,930
I did knock.

289
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,930
Of course. You weren't just
creeping up on me. What a suggestion.

290
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,180
The children are
all in bed and asleep.

291
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,180
Good. Really?

292
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:10,140
Hm.

293
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,770
- Good grief.
- I shall see myself to my room.

294
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,860
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

295
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,780
No, wait.

296
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,120
What do you... I mean, how...
What are your terms?

297
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,960
Your children require five lessons.

298
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:37,300
Lesson one, to go to bed
when they're told, is complete.

299
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,840
As for my terms,
I take Sunday afternoons off.

300
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:45,300
Goodnight.

301
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,560
Interesting.

302
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,700
Time to get up.

303
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:09,040
No.

304
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,380
Hm. I shall give you
half an hour to be up,

305
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:19,130
washed, dressed, teeth
cleaned, beds made

306
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,760
and out into the garden...

307
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,090
for healthful fresh
air before breakfast.

308
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:28,010
Lessons start at nine...sharp.

309
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:34,730
I don't know about you lot,
but I want to stay in bed.

310
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,610
Sebastian, run the thermometer
under the hot tap.

311
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:42,490
Chrissie, chalk. Eric,
crayons. Lily, pepper.

312
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,780
How do you know
she won't do something horrid to us?

313
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,490
I worked it out.

314
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:52,000
She's a trained hypnotist.
That's how she made us do those things.

315
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:55,120
Don't look directly at her
and she can't hypnotise us.

316
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,090
- Morning, Mr Brown.
- Morning.

317
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,090
I'm off to work early.
We're busy at the mortuary.

318
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,630
Some bout of influenza at Archway...

319
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
is carrying off all the
old folks... Ah-ah-ah!

320
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,260
Still, what's bad for them
is good for us.

321
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,310
Poor things.

322
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,230
Well, I know. That, too. Of course.

323
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,900
Odd. She normally says,
"Have a nice day,"

324
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:25,240
or "Don't forget your
jacket" if it's cold out.

325
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:28,530
Very odd. Most peculiar.

326
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,080
Hm.

327
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:37,790
- I did knock.
- Did you? I didn't hear.

328
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,630
I was talking to...

329
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,130
Never mind.

330
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,300
I believe the children
will be staying in bed today.

331
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,350
The children? What, all day?
Are they ill? What's wrong?

332
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,060
Nothing. I know precisely what to do.
Please leave it to me.

333
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,600
You managed them splendidly last night.

334
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,560
If they are under the weather,

335
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,980
give them what they want,
ice-cream and jelly and suchlike.

336
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:05,400
My late wife was very particular.
If ever they were ill,

337
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,110
she used to wait on
them hand and foot...

338
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,160
even if they weren't ill at all.

339
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:14,750
I shall be sure to give them
exactly what they need.

340
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,540
Excellent. Excellent.
Well, I'll just be off to work, then.

341
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,810
She's coming!

342
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:36,020
Remember, everyone,
don't look in her eyes.

343
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,860
Dear me.

344
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:46,240
We can't get up. We're ill.

345
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:48,610
Colds in our doses.

346
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,360
And kemperakurk.

347
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,200
We think it bight be the beasles.

348
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,950
Got measig.

349
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,790
Good heavens.

350
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,210
Then there is of course
no question of your getting up.

351
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,960
I'm very sorry to have to tell you all
that you'll have to stay in bed.

352
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:12,140
Hm.

353
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,370
- Ah.
- I don't feel well.

354
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:39,250
- I think I've got a temperature.
- Don't be daft.

355
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,670
Simon, I can't get up.

356
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,960
- You must have looked at her, then.
- I did not look.

357
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:51,840
I was under the covers the whole time,
Simon. I can't get up either.

358
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,970
- I can't get up!
- I'm stuck like glue!

359
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,810
I'm stuck, too!

360
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:02,810
Hypnosis, eh? Bang goes that theory.

361
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,820
Good morning.

362
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,040
Morning, Mr B!

363
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:22,710
Good morning, Mr Jowls, Mr Wheen.

364
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,630
- Thought we'd get you that time.
- No, not this time.

365
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,260
- Nice tea dance, Mr B?
- Ooh, lovely, I shouldn't wonder.

366
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:34,800
No. I didn't even get there. Disaster.
Children, you know.

367
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,640
- We do know.
- We've said it before.

368
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:41,230
It's not funerals
you should be in the business of.

369
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,770
It's christenings.

370
00:29:52,450 --> 00:29:56,620
Good morning.
Just excuse me a moment, would you?

371
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:59,160
Cedric,
let me not beat about the bush.

372
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:01,040
Your children are out of control.

373
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,750
You need a wife
and your children need a mother.

374
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,420
If you do not remarry by
the end of the month,

375
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:10,590
steps will have to be taken.

376
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,800
Oh, dear. Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

377
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,470
What's your wife like?

378
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,270
Never mind. Less than a month to go.
There's nothing for it.

379
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,610
It'll have to be that woman...
the dreadful one.

380
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,190
Mr Jowls, do you recollect
that...enthusiastic lady?

381
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:38,030
Mrs Swiftly, was it? Or was it
Mrs Thadius something last year?

382
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,200
- Mrs Thadius Quickly?
- Oh, don't.

383
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:46,290
"Oh, Mr Brown, you are a saint. You have
a lovely look of kindness about you."

384
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:52,090
What I wouldn't give for a man like you,
Mr Brown, in my hour of need.

385
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,550
- That one?
- Yes, that one.

386
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,300
We buried Mr Quickly last autumn.
Poor devil.

387
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:02,180
- He was happy to go.
- He was her third.

388
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:06,190
You don't happen to know
if... if she ever...ever, erm...

389
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,900
remarried? You know, number four?

390
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:11,400
Mr Brown, you're not
thinking what I think...

391
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,280
you're thinking, are you, Mr Brown?

392
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,280
Good grief, no! No, no. No. No.

393
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,580
No. No, no... no. What
a thought. No. No.

394
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:26,750
What's that?

395
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,460
Measle medicine,
to be administered once an hour.

396
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:33,170
Actually, I'm not sure it is measles.

397
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,380
How can it be anything other?

398
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,300
The chalky-white faces, the livid spots,

399
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:43,010
the temperatures of 120 degrees.

400
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:46,430
I've seen it time and again. Measles.

401
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,980
Definitely.

402
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:01,990
- Open.
- Simon, don't!

403
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,540
I'm not taking that.

404
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,370
Then you will not get any better.

405
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,330
Believe me.

406
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,960
It's moving!

407
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,800
Open wide.

408
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,590
Wider.

409
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,530
Simon, spit it out!

410
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,200
You'll have to swallow
it sooner or later,

411
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,240
so I suggest you get it over with.

412
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:52,880
Very good. Who's next?

413
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:55,420
"Took..."

414
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,300
"He..."

415
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,420
"He took her lovingly..."

416
00:33:00,670 --> 00:33:05,510
"He took her lovingly
by the...the hand."

417
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,560
Oh! Nanny McPhee, you startled me.

418
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:12,230
It was that quiet.

419
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,820
I just got to practising my sounds.
Lily's teaching me to read.

420
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,360
That is good.

421
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:22,780
They're all good... underneath it all.

422
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,620
- A favourite of yours?
- Don't know.

423
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,910
I haven't finished it yet.

424
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,460
The stepmother's a
bit of a horror, though.

425
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,330
Oh, indeed.

426
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,090
It's a pity stories
aren't about real people.

427
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:42,300
This one seems a farm girl,
but I'll bet a pound to a penny

428
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:46,350
he finds out she's
really an educated lady.

429
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,890
And then he falls for her.

430
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,230
You must read it and find out.

431
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:54,350
He wouldn't love her
if she couldn't read.

432
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,770
He'd think her stupid

433
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:02,070
and worthless and beneath him.

434
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,400
Hm.

435
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:23,130
Buttered spuds for lunch
with boiled beef, apple pie and custard.

436
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,630
Hm.

437
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:31,560
I think the children will be requiring
something a little more...

438
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,680
austere today.

439
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,600
'Orse what?

440
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,730
The children are not quite themselves,
Mrs Blatherwick.

441
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:42,030
God! That means jellies and ice-cream,

442
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,400
raspberry cordial and
God knows what else.

443
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:47,200
Well, I'd better get cracking, then.

444
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:49,580
Evangeline!

445
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:52,040
Where is that lump?

446
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:53,580
It'll be snow in August...

447
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,790
before that one's there
when you need her.

448
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:00,880
Calm yourself, Mrs Blatherwick.
I'm in charge today.

449
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:05,470
I understand that you were once
in the armed forces.

450
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:12,100
I was that. Cooked at a training camp
in Gloucestershire.

451
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,480
Kept those boys strong, I did.

452
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:20,310
I'm sure you did. Perhaps a broth
of some sort for the children.

453
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,650
You must be an expert.

454
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:25,740
Best thin potato gruel with peelings in?

455
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,530
That always got 'em groaning
but kept 'em strong.

456
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,870
Are you well supplied with peelings?

457
00:35:36,370 --> 00:35:38,460
These'll do. Only a day old.

458
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,260
A bit of gristle for
flavour. Ever so tasty.

459
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,760
Get that down you.

460
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,270
There's a lot of goodness
in a turkey neck.

461
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,640
That'll put the hairs
back on your chest.

462
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,150
Smell that.

463
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:04,230
That is the smell that
forged this empire.

464
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:08,740
That pong is the pong of conquerors.

465
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,120
All right, men. As you were.

466
00:36:13,870 --> 00:36:16,700
They actually are starving us.

467
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,210
I wonder how long it will
take for us all to die.

468
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:39,230
Quickly...

469
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,860
Quickly, Quickly, Quickly...

470
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,650
Mrs Selma Quickly.

471
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,830
Have you lazy lot been in bed all day?

472
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,870
Evangeline.

473
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,290
You've been doing measles, haven't you?

474
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,790
The situation's very simple, Evangeline.

475
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,210
The nanny, who in my opinion is a witch,

476
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,170
made us ill and fed
us boiled-down toads.

477
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:12,300
Nanny McPhee is not a witch, Eric.
You're very naughty to say so.

478
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,760
I'm sure she knew what she was doing.

479
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:18,720
- She must be fully trained.
- Yes, but as what?

480
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:21,520
I'm unbelievably hungry, Evangeline.

481
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:26,270
Can you please get us
something decent to eat?

482
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,820
Did you just say "please"?

483
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,200
Please, please, Evangeline!

484
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:36,490
Well, children,
I hear you've been in bed all day

485
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,330
but that you're better now.

486
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,790
It wasn't our fault.

487
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,960
I'm sure it wasn't anybody's fault.
You can't help it if you're ill.

488
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:47,000
But you're better now.

489
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,180
- Papa?
- Yes, Chrissie?

490
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:04,560
Now that we're better, can we get up?

491
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:07,770
Can we get up, please?

492
00:38:17,410 --> 00:38:19,580
Of course you can.

493
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,450
Read to us.

494
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,000
I, erm... I have my
letter-writing to do. I...

495
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,920
I'll read to you tomorrow.
Goodnight, my dears.

496
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,720
Evangeline,

497
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:41,850
please ask Cook to make the children
scrambled eggs on toast.

498
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,980
I'm sure they'd like supper
now they're feeling better.

499
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:48,360
I'll do it myself, Nanny McPhee.

500
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,530
Didn't she have two bumpy things?

501
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,830
The word is "wart".

502
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:04,660
Traditionally associated with witches,
as it happens.

503
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:07,250
Well, one of 'em's gone.

504
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,970
I did knock.

505
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:23,180
Of course you did.

506
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:27,440
Lesson two, to get up when they're told,
is complete.

507
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:29,770
Of course. Very good. Thank you.

508
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,110
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

509
00:39:33,650 --> 00:39:36,150
- Nanny McPhee...
- Yes, Mr Brown?

510
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,660
Didn't you used to have two...

511
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:43,160
w...w...?

512
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:49,250
Never mind. It's, er...
it's my imagination.

513
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,550
There was a telegram, Mr Brown.

514
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,310
Oh, my... Oh, my goodness.

515
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:17,780
- Ah, Nanny McPhee.
- Pa!

516
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:21,700
Good, good, good.
All right, I have an announcement.

517
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,370
Yes...

518
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,660
Your Great-Aunt Adelaide
is coming for tea today.

519
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,210
- No!
- Aunt Adelaide is vile and vicious.

520
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:32,500
She's blind as a bat.

521
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,880
And we are convalescing,
for heaven's sake!

522
00:40:35,090 --> 00:40:37,170
That's enough. I don't want to hear...

523
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,550
anything bad about her.
She pays the rent.

524
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,220
- She scares me.
- She's only coming for tea.

525
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,770
You'll all put your best clothes on

526
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:48,480
and Nanny McPhee will keep you in order.

527
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,020
I shall do my best, sir,
considering that today is Sunday

528
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:55,360
and I am off duty this afternoon.

529
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,280
Off duty?

530
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:02,110
You're off duty when...?

531
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:05,280
You can't be off duty.
I need you. They need you.

532
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:07,450
I shall be leaving at noon.

533
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:10,370
Thereafter, I'm sure
the children will do...

534
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:13,210
exactly as they're told.
Won't you, children?

535
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,050
Listen to this, dear.
Aunt Adelaide says,

536
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:20,800
"l am coming with the express intention

537
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,010
of easing your financial burden."

538
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:28,350
Maybe she's thought the better
of my having to remarry.

539
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,350
Perhaps I won't have
to go through with it.

540
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:51,620
I hate my best clothes.
They're itchy.

541
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,870
Well, we promised, so that's that.

542
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,170
Tora's right.
We should do exactly as we're told.

543
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,510
We've been told to put
our best clothes on, haven't we? Right.

544
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:07,850
Well, I'm going to put
my best clothes on...the pig.

545
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,350
Simon, no.

546
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:13,190
- Yeah, the pig!
- Oh, please, don't!

547
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:23,900
- Aunt Adelaide, welcome back.
- Where are you?

548
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,410
- Here I am, Aunt Adelaide.
- Oh! Don't crowd me so.

549
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,790
You're looking very peely-wally.
Where's my tea? I must have tea.

550
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,660
Of course. This way. At once.

551
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,830
I smell damp.

552
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,760
No, no... At least not noticeably.

553
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,510
Damp in the house.
Hence your pallid complexion.

554
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,720
Lovely hat.

555
00:42:44,970 --> 00:42:48,760
A gift from the Duchess of Kent.
She has taste.

556
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,020
I've always hated this room.

557
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,770
- Milk?
- Certainly not.

558
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,310
Filthy stuff. Most unhealthy.

559
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,860
- Sugar?
- Six, if you please.

560
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,610
Six.

561
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:05,910
Let me not beat about the bush, Cedric.
You have too many children.

562
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,530
- Ah, that.
- Don't interrupt.

563
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:14,040
Your wife, my poor, weak-minded niece,
had no sense of proportion.

564
00:43:14,290 --> 00:43:19,380
However, I know where my duties lie.
I gave her my word that I would help.

565
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,760
As you know, Cedric, my word is my law.

566
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,380
I now propose to help you further.

567
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:28,720
Oh, thank you, Aunt
Adelaide. Thank you.

568
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,720
Don't interrupt. Sit down.

569
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:33,560
This is my proposal.

570
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:37,440
I shall relieve you of
one of your children...

571
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:41,520
and give it a home with
me at Stitch Manor.

572
00:43:47,030 --> 00:43:50,160
It will require sacrifice on my part.
I realise that.

573
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:56,330
But as my sainted father always said,
"Duty, Adelaide, always duty."

574
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,130
- You mustn't. I can't possibly...
- Thank me enough. I know.

575
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,090
You must feel quite overwhelmed
by the benefits of such a plan.

576
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:05,970
Your fortunate daughter,

577
00:44:06,170 --> 00:44:09,760
for it must be a girl
and not one of those other things,

578
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:13,890
will receive private tuition
in literature, history, deportment

579
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:17,390
and above all, elocution.

580
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:22,980
If there's one thing I won't stand for,
it's loose vowels.

581
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:28,740
What did Papa say? He must have
told her not to even think of it.

582
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:31,410
He didn't say anything.

583
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:38,330
Come on. Let's find the others.

584
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:42,130
I must be frank.
There is no question of your taking...

585
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,670
Hush now! I'm used to
taking responsibility...

586
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:47,760
for other people's mistakes.

587
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,600
Now, where is the bulk
of your offspring?

588
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:03,020
Ah. Here we are.

589
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,610
- It was a bee. A big bee. Erm...
- Good heavens!

590
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,870
Gone now. Phew.

591
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,250
- Hm.
- You're not well, Cedric.

592
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,880
The sooner you find a
good wife, the better.

593
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,920
This'll put her off
wanting any of you girls.

594
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:30,050
Speak up, girl!

595
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:34,010
Oh! What an unfortunate face.

596
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:37,220
All those bristles.

597
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:40,770
It might be very hard
to get her decently betrothed.

598
00:45:43,310 --> 00:45:45,730
Do you not have a more comely girl?

599
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:55,030
Perhaps round the front of the house.

600
00:45:58,790 --> 00:46:02,250
Chrissie, hurry up!

601
00:46:04,710 --> 00:46:07,210
Tie it, Chrissie.

602
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:10,380
Eric, stop her!

603
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:12,550
- Chrissie, stop! She'll see you!
- Papa!

604
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,050
Cedric, I had no idea
that you had produced such a...

605
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:19,770
such an unattractive batch of females.

606
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,890
I shall leave directly. Get my hat.

607
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,730
Your hat? So soon?

608
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:29,860
- Really? No, you can't... I'll get it.
- Hewitt!

609
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,240
No!

610
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:42,790
Oh, yes. You'll do perfectly.

611
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:47,920
A little timid, perhaps,
but we'll soon knock that out of you.

612
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,380
Come on, come on. It
can't do any harm to try.

613
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:54,430
I can't find your... What are you doing?

614
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,970
- This is the chosen one. Get her ready.
- Papa, help!

615
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,010
Chrissie? You're not listen...

616
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:01,310
Shut up, Cedric, and do as you're told!

617
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,810
Nanny McPhee, we need you.

618
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:10,650
Nanny McPhee, please, we need you.

619
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:14,860
Where is my hat?

620
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,660
Hide!

621
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:26,500
My hat!

622
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:29,920
How dare you!

623
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,810
- Oh, my, what a merry game.
- Yoo-hoo!

624
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:46,600
My, my, what a pretty girl you are.

625
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,650
Oh, this is the girl for me.

626
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,700
Run.

627
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:03,160
Such poise, such gaiety.

628
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:06,410
- Ah, there you are, staff.
- Yes, madam.

629
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:10,710
I'm taking this child
with me. Get her ready.

630
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,300
Very well, madam.

631
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:21,890
Sherry time.

632
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:28,640
Do not forget that someone
has to go with your great-aunt

633
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,360
and it cannot be the donkey, can it?

634
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,910
Well, I'm the eldest girl. I'll go.

635
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:50,120
No. I've always known
I was destined for tragedy. I'll go.

636
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:52,170
Aggy go.

637
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,960
Don't be silly, Aggy.
You're not even a whole girl yet.

638
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,260
No. She wanted me. I'll go.

639
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:02,600
You can't all go.

640
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:16,730
Well, I am entirely satisfied.

641
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:21,490
I will keep my word, Cedric,
if you will keep yours.

642
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:25,370
You must give those children a mother
before the month is out.

643
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,990
No.

644
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,120
What?

645
00:49:30,370 --> 00:49:34,630
You cannot order me around. And you
certainly can't take any of my children.

646
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,420
l...

647
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:40,380
Your carriage awaits, madam.

648
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:42,680
Is the chosen one seated?

649
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:46,010
- lndeed she is.
- Good.

650
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,850
- All is prepared.
- Which chosen one? What's prepared?

651
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:52,850
Cedric, in view of this afternoon's
happy outcome,

652
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:56,730
I am willing to overlook
that last unattractive outburst.

653
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:59,400
- Nanny McPhee.
- Off we go, Hewitt.

654
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:02,490
- What have you done?
- I have done nothing, sir.

655
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:05,200
The children have decided
amongst themselves.

656
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:07,580
Decided what? What do you mean?

657
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,830
There you are, dear.

658
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:13,250
Not little Chrissie.

659
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,040
Chrissie!

660
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:20,920
Chrissie!

661
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:23,340
Yah!

662
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:26,470
Chrissie!

663
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:34,230
Now, then, you'd better
tell me your name, little girl.

664
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:39,280
Christianna!

665
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:42,280
Don't be shy, my dear.
What is your name?

666
00:50:46,370 --> 00:50:49,080
Sit up straight and tell me your name.

667
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:53,500
No!

668
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:56,750
- Christianna!
- Papa!

669
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,750
Papa! Papa!

670
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:05,380
Oh!

671
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:10,890
Then...then who...?

672
00:51:14,730 --> 00:51:18,480
Evangeline. My name's Evangeline.

673
00:51:26,950 --> 00:51:30,950
And what a pretty name it is, too.

674
00:51:34,250 --> 00:51:36,420
Evangeline...

675
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:39,630
Oh.

676
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,610
Time for bed.

677
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:08,660
- Thank you for saving me, Nanny McPhee.
- Hm.

678
00:52:10,490 --> 00:52:13,290
Yes. Thank you.

679
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:15,710
Thank you.

680
00:52:15,910 --> 00:52:18,250
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

681
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,180
Hm.

682
00:52:38,390 --> 00:52:41,190
Papa was going to let her take me.

683
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:46,240
No, Christianna.
Your father would never have allowed it.

684
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:57,830
- Goodnight, children.
- Goodnight, Nanny McPhee.

685
00:53:02,290 --> 00:53:04,590
She hasn't got any warts at all now.

686
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,670
Do you think she's using
some sort of cream?

687
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:39,330
Thank you, Nanny McPhee.
You were a tremendous help.

688
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,830
Not at all.

689
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,130
You will find that lesson three,

690
00:53:43,330 --> 00:53:46,750
to get dressed when they're told,
is complete.

691
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,340
Just to get dressed when they're told?

692
00:53:49,420 --> 00:53:52,180
They've learned a great
deal more than that.

693
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:55,970
I have five lessons to teach.

694
00:53:56,180 --> 00:54:00,730
What lessons they learn is entirely
up to them. Goodnight, Mr Brown.

695
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,860
- Nanny McPhee...
- Yes, Mr Brown?

696
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,440
She will be all right, won't she?
Evangeline, I mean.

697
00:54:10,990 --> 00:54:14,120
I can't help being concerned.

698
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:18,370
Aunt Adelaide can be so, erm...
Well, you saw.

699
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:21,080
She will certainly be all right.

700
00:54:21,290 --> 00:54:23,830
Good.

701
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:26,420
I suppose she volunteered
to go, did she?

702
00:54:26,540 --> 00:54:29,000
Couldn't wait to be
shot of us, I imagine.

703
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,050
Not quite.

704
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,800
It was Simon's idea.

705
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:35,510
He knew Evangeline
might like to educate herself

706
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:38,890
and that her going
would save Christianna.

707
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:40,890
He's a very clever boy.

708
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:43,060
Good heavens. Simon, eh?

709
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:46,690
Well, good for him.
Quick...quick thinking.

710
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,190
Goodnight, Mr Brown.

711
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:06,170
So that's it, then.

712
00:55:06,380 --> 00:55:09,340
I shall have to marry...Quickly.

713
00:56:02,140 --> 00:56:05,480
Children, your father
has asked me to tell you

714
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,560
there's a Mrs Quickly
coming for tea tomorrow.

715
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,570
- Nanny McPhee?
- Yes, sweetheart?

716
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:19,160
Can you stop Papa
from marrying a horrible stepmother?

717
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,990
I'm afraid not.

718
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:28,540
- Even if you wanted to?
- Even if I wanted to.

719
00:56:28,750 --> 00:56:33,630
I cannot interfere with
affairs of the heart.

720
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:43,600
Perhaps Simon could
talk to him about it.

721
00:56:43,810 --> 00:56:46,020
He won't listen.

722
00:56:57,610 --> 00:56:59,860
You have a visitor, Mr Brown.

723
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:03,660
An especially eager visitor, Mr Brown.

724
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:16,590
Quickly by name...

725
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:17,920
Oh!

726
00:57:18,130 --> 00:57:20,300
Simon, my boy.

727
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,760
Well, come in.

728
00:57:22,970 --> 00:57:24,930
Come on, I won't bite.

729
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,020
- Father, we want to ask you something.
- Well, of course.

730
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:34,270
Of course. Anything at all. Ask away.

731
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:37,190
Who is Mrs Quickly?

732
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:42,570
Good heavens, such a face. She's, er...

733
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:45,530
She's...she's a friend.
She's...a friend.

734
00:57:45,740 --> 00:57:47,660
Just a friend?

735
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:48,580
Well, my boy,

736
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:51,250
it's not exactly any of
your business, is it?

737
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,710
It is if she's to be our new mother.

738
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:55,710
Who said anything about that?

739
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,840
It is true? You are going to marry her?

740
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,260
You go too far, Simon.

741
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:04,970
- You must not question...
- I didn't.

742
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:06,890
- Don't contradict me!
- I'm not!

743
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,020
You do not understand the adult world.

744
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,190
You know, there are
certain things that...

745
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,110
certain things...

746
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:18,690
You will leave me this instant. Go home!

747
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:23,490
You never listen!

748
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:54,980
Nanny McPhee?

749
00:58:57,860 --> 00:58:59,980
Nanny McPhee?

750
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:06,930
Hello, Simon.

751
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:08,720
Can I help you?

752
01:00:08,930 --> 01:00:11,060
I did knock.

753
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:14,480
I know. I heard you.

754
01:00:18,060 --> 01:00:20,480
May I be of assistance?

755
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,410
We need you to, erm...

756
01:00:27,610 --> 01:00:30,030
I mean...you saved Chrissie.

757
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:32,950
And so...

758
01:00:33,160 --> 01:00:36,040
You're on our side, is what I mean.

759
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,210
Aren't you?

760
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:43,130
You saved Chrissie, and
I do not take sides.

761
01:00:45,010 --> 01:00:51,220
I...we... need you to help us
get rid of this woman, Mrs Quickly.

762
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:56,980
It will not surprise you to hear
that I cannot agree to that, Simon.

763
01:00:57,180 --> 01:01:01,110
Then let us do whatever
we have to do to get rid of her.

764
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,150
Are you prepared to accept
the consequences?

765
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:06,740
Yes.

766
01:01:06,940 --> 01:01:10,910
- You promise?
- Yes. Yes, absolutely, I promise.

767
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:20,370
Then I will, as you put it,
let you do whatever you have to do.

768
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,380
Thank you.

769
01:01:24,170 --> 01:01:26,670
Thank you.

770
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:33,600
Look at them! Will
you just look at them?

771
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:39,980
The little, small things.

772
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:43,560
Children, this is, er... Mrs Quickly.

773
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:45,780
Oh, you mustn't be so formal.

774
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:50,450
You must call me Auntie Selma.

775
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:54,410
Oh, dear me, one does work up
such a thirst in this heat.

776
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:58,160
Oh. Tea, of course. Do
go through. I'll...

777
01:01:58,370 --> 01:02:02,420
And leave these dear creatures?
How can you ask it of me?

778
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:07,840
- Oh, the heart of the house.
- Yes, yes.

779
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:10,300
- The old bachelor's den.
- Mm.

780
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:13,720
- Well, l...
- lsn't it enchanting?

781
01:02:13,930 --> 01:02:16,220
Ooh! Have you read all those books?

782
01:02:16,430 --> 01:02:18,470
- Well, l, er...
- Clever.

783
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,900
- Take my chair. It's more comfortable.
- Thank you. Ooh!

784
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,900
Well, what have we here?

785
01:02:26,110 --> 01:02:29,190
I see there is already
provision for a lady.

786
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,900
How thoughtful you are.

787
01:02:31,110 --> 01:02:33,160
What a gentleman.

788
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:39,080
Wait! Er...just let me
make it, er...comfy for you.

789
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:40,870
Too, too precious.

790
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:44,830
Here in the centre of the male dominion,

791
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:48,420
..an oasis of feminine
charm and elegance.

792
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:53,010
There, just as I thought. It's dusty.
It just needs a good old thump.

793
01:02:53,220 --> 01:02:56,300
There. All thumped and ready to go.

794
01:02:56,510 --> 01:03:00,850
There you go again.
Nothing is too much trouble for you.

795
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:06,860
I observed that very characteristic
on the sad day we buried Mr Quickly.

796
01:03:07,060 --> 01:03:10,530
Even in my demented grief,
I said to my friend Letitia Carter...

797
01:03:10,740 --> 01:03:15,280
Remember her? A pinker complexion
than my own. She takes too much sun.

798
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:19,490
I said, "Kindness seems to be
second nature to him."

799
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:21,700
"He is a perfect gentleman."

800
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:25,920
"There's something so masculine
and yet retiring in his manner..."

801
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:27,960
Mr Brown!

802
01:03:33,470 --> 01:03:35,510
Un moment, I pray you.

803
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:37,680
I don't know what came over me.

804
01:03:37,890 --> 01:03:42,140
I do. I understand. I
never took you for such.

805
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:47,150
But now I see it.
Passion is clearly your nature, too.

806
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:52,490
I feel it. Who would have thought
we were such kindred spirits?

807
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:54,240
Passion is my life.

808
01:03:54,320 --> 01:03:57,870
In fact, Mr Brown, what
is life without it?

809
01:03:58,820 --> 01:04:02,660
A grey wheel of habit, spinning idly on.

810
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:14,670
This is no time for
food, Mrs Quickly...

811
01:04:14,800 --> 01:04:15,300
Selma.

812
01:04:15,510 --> 01:04:18,300
I couldn't possibly swallow it
under the circumstances.

813
01:04:18,510 --> 01:04:20,930
You are tempestuous, Mr Brown.

814
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:25,350
- Tea?
- Yes, tea.

815
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,270
We must blanket the raw impulse
with that reliable beverage.

816
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:35,320
That's a nice bit of
porcelain. Is that Spode?

817
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,280
I like a bit of Spode. Tasteful.

818
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:41,120
Anyway, so essential
for upholding the normal...

819
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:44,750
- You don't want that.
- How right you are.

820
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:47,620
You see into my inmost self.

821
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:52,630
What is tea when we can drink
from the nectar of our emotions?

822
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,670
Let the common herd drink tea.

823
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:58,630
Our souls need a more divine libation!

824
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:06,430
Oh! You mad fool! I say.

825
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,480
No, no, not here amongst the cutlery.

826
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:11,980
I say!

827
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:17,030
I must go before my reputation
is in tatters on this rug.

828
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,450
Lovely rug. Is it Chinese silk?

829
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:22,240
Must escape before all is lost.

830
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:23,780
Wait!

831
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:28,460
Heavens to Betsy! You are inflamed!

832
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:33,340
How does a lonely widow best you?
What defences does she have?

833
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:38,010
All it takes is one question, Cedric,
and I'm yours.

834
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:43,510
- Ask me or you'll lose me forever.
- Oh, no... Absolutely.

835
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:46,310
Say it. Say it.

836
01:05:46,520 --> 01:05:50,350
- Say it. Say it.
- No!

837
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:55,570
Oh! No! This is too much, sir!

838
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:59,070
You are a cad!

839
01:06:00,950 --> 01:06:04,200
A bounder and a cad!

840
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:07,830
Yeah!

841
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,910
Papa's coming.

842
01:06:21,590 --> 01:06:24,430
She's gone.

843
01:06:24,640 --> 01:06:29,100
The only person in the whole world
who stands between all of us

844
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:31,980
and total ruin...

845
01:06:32,190 --> 01:06:35,060
and she's gone.

846
01:06:36,610 --> 01:06:38,730
What's ruin?

847
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:44,870
There's no time to mince words.
I can't support my own family.

848
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:48,660
I never have been able to.
There are so many of you.

849
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,040
But you're all so delicious.

850
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,670
When Aggy came along
and your mother was so ill, I said,

851
01:06:55,880 --> 01:07:00,210
"We may have to stop now, dear,"
and she said...

852
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:02,930
She said, "l know."

853
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,690
The fact of the matter is,
your Great-Aunt Adelaide

854
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:17,820
has been supporting us for years
with a monthly allowance.

855
01:07:18,020 --> 01:07:20,440
A little while ago, she told me

856
01:07:20,650 --> 01:07:23,820
that I had to remarry
or the allowance would stop.

857
01:07:24,030 --> 01:07:27,030
This woman today was my last chance.

858
01:07:27,240 --> 01:07:29,370
Our last chance.

859
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,330
Ours?

860
01:07:32,790 --> 01:07:36,460
When the money stops,
the house will be taken.

861
01:07:36,670 --> 01:07:40,090
Some of you will perhaps
be put into the workhouse.

862
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:44,840
Some will be put into the care...
into the care of others.

863
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:49,760
I don't know how many of you
will be allowed to stay together.

864
01:07:56,650 --> 01:07:58,690
I'm sorry to have failed you, children.

865
01:08:02,740 --> 01:08:05,320
You deserve so much better.

866
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:14,330
- Do something.
- What would you suggest?

867
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:19,460
Change what happened.
Bang your stick. Make it undo itself.

868
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:21,880
I cannot. These were your actions.

869
01:08:22,090 --> 01:08:25,760
Simon promised that you would
accept the consequences.

870
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:29,430
What shall we do?
Help us. Tell us what to do.

871
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:34,230
- You must undo it for yourselves.
- How? How?

872
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:36,770
Think.

873
01:08:36,980 --> 01:08:39,810
You are very clever, children.

874
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,610
Think.

875
01:08:45,280 --> 01:08:46,650
So, 'e was keen?

876
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:49,990
Oh, Letty, he was in
a maddened condition.

877
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,370
He couldn't keep his hands off me.
But I held firm.

878
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:58,420
I said, "Shedric..." I mean, "Cedric,
I have my reputation to uphold."

879
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:01,540
"It's marriage or nothing.
What do you take me for?"

880
01:09:01,750 --> 01:09:03,050
"Some common...?"

881
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,880
- Tart?
- Not for me. I'm bloated.

882
01:09:06,090 --> 01:09:08,470
No."Some common tart." You said...

883
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,470
Who's that knocking?

884
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,720
It might be him.

885
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,890
If you've come to fumble
with my fastenings... Oh.

886
01:09:20,480 --> 01:09:23,150
Mrs Quickly, we're very
sorry about the tea...

887
01:09:23,230 --> 01:09:24,610
you had with our father.

888
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,240
Typical of a man, sending
his little ones...

889
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:28,490
to do the dirty work.

890
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,240
No. He doesn't know we're...

891
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,950
I mean, he very much wants to marry you.

892
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:38,210
I know what he wanted.
No wonder there's so many of you!

893
01:09:38,410 --> 01:09:42,920
Wait. Father wasn't being rude.
No one on earth could be less rude.

894
01:09:43,130 --> 01:09:46,380
He was protecting you from
the naughty things we were doing.

895
01:09:46,590 --> 01:09:49,720
- The toad in the teapot.
- And the wormy sandwiches.

896
01:09:49,930 --> 01:09:53,390
That was my idea! I mean, my fault.

897
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:56,600
I have no idea to what
you can be referring.

898
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:00,940
Don't try to make excuses for him.
He's a flounder and a gad.

899
01:10:01,150 --> 01:10:04,650
He's not. He's a good man.
He was just trying to save us.

900
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:07,400
If he doesn't marry,
all the money will go.

901
01:10:07,490 --> 01:10:09,700
We'll be thrown out onto the streets.

902
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:13,780
- Money? What money?
- Our Great-Aunt Adelaide's money.

903
01:10:13,990 --> 01:10:16,490
Lady Adelaide Stitch.

904
01:10:16,700 --> 01:10:19,410
Lady? Ooh!

905
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:22,670
- Mr Brown.
- Mrs Quickly.

906
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:26,130
- Your children have explained it all.
- Explained?

907
01:10:26,340 --> 01:10:28,630
That their tricks during
tea was a result...

908
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,300
of their motherless condition,

909
01:10:30,510 --> 01:10:33,140
that they need a woman's presence
to calm them,

910
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:36,100
and that you could benefit
from that presence,

911
01:10:36,310 --> 01:10:38,470
pathetic and lonely as you are.

912
01:10:38,680 --> 01:10:44,730
And all it takes is one
little question, Cedric.

913
01:10:47,190 --> 01:10:50,360
Oh. Oh, y... er...yes, of course.

914
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,950
Erm...just give me...Yes.

915
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,240
- Mrs Quickly...
- Selma.

916
01:10:56,450 --> 01:10:58,330
Yes, I mean Selma.

917
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:02,710
Would you do me the honour
of becoming my...

918
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:08,210
- ..of becoming my...
- Wife.

919
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:13,720
- Exactly. Wife. That's the word.
- Yes. Oh, yes, Cedric.

920
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:22,140
Off you go now, dears.

921
01:11:22,350 --> 01:11:25,690
Let Daddy have a little
moment to himself...

922
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:27,270
with your new mummy.

923
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,280
A bit big for this nightie, aren't...

924
01:11:34,410 --> 01:11:36,870
you, sweetheart? We'll
have a new one made.

925
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,750
I'm sorry.

926
01:11:51,090 --> 01:11:54,590
I should have told you.
I can see that now.

927
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:58,680
If I'd discussed it with you before,
we wouldn't be in this mess.

928
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:03,270
No, it was our fault.

929
01:12:05,730 --> 01:12:09,610
We should have known you had
a good reason for getting married.

930
01:12:09,820 --> 01:12:13,030
At least this way,
we'll all be together.

931
01:12:13,110 --> 01:12:16,160
That's what matters most, isn't it? Hm?

932
01:12:16,360 --> 01:12:19,740
I promise I'll never hide anything
that affects us from you again.

933
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:23,040
I see you're more than capable
of understanding it.

934
01:12:24,580 --> 01:12:27,500
- Papa?
- Yes, my boy?

935
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:31,960
Do you think Mama still thinks about us
where she is?

936
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,010
I'm sure she does.

937
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,010
I know she does.

938
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:50,650
Now, Chrissie,
why don't you choose us a story?

939
01:12:52,730 --> 01:12:55,320
# Tiptoe by

940
01:12:55,530 --> 01:12:59,070
- # Where my babies lie...
- Lesson four is complete.

941
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,740
# In your tiny silver shoon...

942
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:05,370
Lesson four?

943
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,290
To listen.

944
01:13:12,290 --> 01:13:13,920
Well done.

945
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:19,680
# Will you watch over, please

946
01:13:19,890 --> 01:13:23,100
# My wee ones

947
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:26,730
# My lambkins

948
01:13:26,930 --> 01:13:32,900
# My sweet chick-a-chickadees

949
01:13:33,860 --> 01:13:39,780
# Loola-bye, oh, loola-bye

950
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:53,500
# In your tiny silver shoon #

951
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:01,340
The big day.
I do love my weddings.

952
01:14:01,550 --> 01:14:04,140
Mr Brown. What's he really like?

953
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:07,060
No idea. Keen as mustard
to tie the knot, though.

954
01:14:07,270 --> 01:14:11,020
Had to sort this out quick.
Only got the sheep dipped yesterday.

955
01:14:11,230 --> 01:14:15,070
But he's easily controlled,
unlike his nasty little brood.

956
01:14:15,270 --> 01:14:17,780
However will you manage them, Selma?

957
01:14:17,990 --> 01:14:20,910
I've got a few tricks up my sleeve.
Never you mind.

958
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:24,080
I started off by giving
them a good clean-up.

959
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,540
Oh, don't they look lovely?

960
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:31,250
Sebastian, your top button is undone.

961
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:35,800
Lily, you have a little hair caught
in your crook. Eric, help her, please.

962
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:38,840
Your father will be down in a moment.

963
01:14:39,050 --> 01:14:43,720
Now, that is an improvement.
Letty, go and keep a lookout.

964
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,890
I say, whatever your name is,

965
01:14:47,100 --> 01:14:50,230
give me a second on my own
with the little darlings?

966
01:14:55,230 --> 01:15:00,070
Now, my dears, there's going to be
some changes made round here.

967
01:15:01,740 --> 01:15:04,070
I'm in charge of this household now

968
01:15:04,280 --> 01:15:08,790
and while I'm in charge,
you children will behave.

969
01:15:08,990 --> 01:15:12,750
Do you hear? Behave.

970
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:17,340
Behave.

971
01:15:19,670 --> 01:15:22,510
And we're not having any
of that nasty noise...

972
01:15:22,630 --> 01:15:24,800
all the way through my nice wedding.

973
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:29,930
Shut her up.

974
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:33,560
Naughty.

975
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:36,060
It's our mother's rattle. Give it back.

976
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:38,440
I'm your mother now.

977
01:15:44,070 --> 01:15:46,160
Time to adapt.

978
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:57,590
Papa, Mrs Quickly...

979
01:15:57,790 --> 01:15:59,960
Yoo-hoo, Cedric.

980
01:16:00,170 --> 01:16:03,720
I realise the bride and groom
shouldn't meet until the ceremony,

981
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:06,800
but you and I are old hands at this.

982
01:16:07,010 --> 01:16:11,140
She's here! Lady Stitch!

983
01:16:11,350 --> 01:16:13,020
Selma, there's footmen.

984
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:18,690
Oi, make way!

985
01:16:22,360 --> 01:16:23,820
Where's the woman?

986
01:16:24,030 --> 01:16:27,450
- Aunt Adelaide...
- Shut up! Where's the woman, Cedric?

987
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:30,370
May I present my...fiancee,
Selma Quickly.

988
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:32,200
Selma, this is Lady Stitch.

989
01:16:32,410 --> 01:16:36,290
Your Ladyness. Welcome,
if I may be so bold,

990
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:39,090
to our humble, nay, lowly festivities.

991
01:16:39,290 --> 01:16:42,510
You shower glory upon us from above.

992
01:16:42,710 --> 01:16:46,550
The very air about you shines with...

993
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,930
with...with aboveness.

994
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:55,310
A gracious welcome, I must say.
Rise, my dear.

995
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:58,310
Here are the children
in their, erm...shepherdess outfits.

996
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:02,690
Well, that's the girls.
The boys... I'm not sure what they are.

997
01:17:02,900 --> 01:17:04,940
But, erm...anyway, you can see.

998
01:17:05,150 --> 01:17:07,320
Oh, keep up, will you?

999
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:28,590
Who's that?

1000
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,890
- It's a princess.
- A fairy princess.

1001
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:37,310
It's Evangeline.

1002
01:17:40,060 --> 01:17:43,980
Straight back. Remember your vowels.

1003
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:50,660
May I present my adopted daughter,
Miss Evangeline Stitch.

1004
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:58,330
What are we doing milling about
in this dreary vestibule?

1005
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:00,670
Sherry this instant.

1006
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:05,380
Might I beg the honour of pouring
the privileged schooners myself?

1007
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:09,720
Delectable to see you again, madam.

1008
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:12,090
Blinkin' hell!

1009
01:18:14,310 --> 01:18:17,180
And how nice to see the young people.

1010
01:18:17,390 --> 01:18:21,520
Welcome back, Evangeline.
You look well. Are you well?

1011
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,730
I am most content.

1012
01:18:26,030 --> 01:18:29,820
You must be very happy
to be marrying again.

1013
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:35,790
Oh, yes, I'm... I'm...
How did you put it? Most content.

1014
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:38,870
Of course. Good grief.

1015
01:18:40,500 --> 01:18:42,540
I am so glad.

1016
01:18:42,750 --> 01:18:44,920
Evangeline!

1017
01:18:45,130 --> 01:18:47,710
Pray excuse me.

1018
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:54,390
Are you sure it's Evangeline?
It doesn't look anything like her.

1019
01:18:54,600 --> 01:18:57,470
Nonsense. She's always looked like that.

1020
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:32,760
What can we do?
There has to be another way.

1021
01:19:32,970 --> 01:19:36,180
- Behave.
- Beehive.

1022
01:19:36,390 --> 01:19:38,260
You must do as you're told.

1023
01:19:38,470 --> 01:19:40,810
- Behave.
- Beehive.

1024
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:45,980
Lesson number five, Simon.
You must do exactly as you're told.

1025
01:19:54,990 --> 01:19:56,740
Beehive.

1026
01:19:56,950 --> 01:19:58,330
Beehive?

1027
01:19:58,530 --> 01:20:00,240
Please be seated.

1028
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,370
There isn't a beehive. What do you mean?

1029
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:12,130
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here together

1030
01:20:12,340 --> 01:20:17,180
in the sight of God
and in the face of this congregation

1031
01:20:17,390 --> 01:20:21,680
to join together this man and this woman

1032
01:20:21,890 --> 01:20:24,850
in holy matrimony,

1033
01:20:25,060 --> 01:20:30,400
which is an honourable estate
instituted of God

1034
01:20:30,610 --> 01:20:33,570
in the time of man's innocence...

1035
01:20:36,070 --> 01:20:38,700
..and commended of St Paul...

1036
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:42,240
..to be honoured among all men.

1037
01:20:42,450 --> 01:20:44,120
Get off!

1038
01:20:44,330 --> 01:20:46,960
- And is therefore...
- Get off!

1039
01:20:47,170 --> 01:20:50,670
- .. not by any man to be enterprised...
- There's one on you!

1040
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:56,380
.. nor taken in hand unadvisedly,
lightly, wantonly...

1041
01:20:57,300 --> 01:21:01,810
- There's one on your back!
- ..to satisfy man's carnal lusts...

1042
01:21:02,010 --> 01:21:05,600
It's the flowers on her dress!
They're attracting them!

1043
01:21:05,810 --> 01:21:08,810
- I hate bees. I'm allergic.
- There aren't any bees, you fool!

1044
01:21:09,020 --> 01:21:11,770
No, truly, I swell up.

1045
01:21:11,980 --> 01:21:13,360
They're trying to ruin...

1046
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:15,900
my lovely wedding. Nasty,
vicious creatures.

1047
01:21:16,110 --> 01:21:18,740
Do something!

1048
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:23,990
Cedric, look at me. Do you see any bees?

1049
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:36,760
I said, look at me!
Do you see any bees? Do you?

1050
01:21:36,970 --> 01:21:39,390
- Do you?
- I do.

1051
01:21:39,590 --> 01:21:44,270
It's all right. I've
got the little bugger.

1052
01:21:44,470 --> 01:21:47,020
It's on me!

1053
01:21:47,230 --> 01:21:52,150
Lord love a duck! I'm
so dreadfully sorry!

1054
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,570
No, no, no, no, no...

1055
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:03,410
Oh, my Lord. Your Higherness!

1056
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:36,070
- Don't touch the cake!
- Get the tarts!

1057
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:38,820
- Not me good ones!
- Ow, he hit me!

1058
01:22:39,900 --> 01:22:41,910
Attack!

1059
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:46,040
Not the cake! Not the cake!

1060
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:50,710
Right! I'll have the lot of you!

1061
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,580
Simon, bowling practice.

1062
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:26,490
Evangeline, where are your manners?

1063
01:23:26,700 --> 01:23:28,490
Sod my manners, you old trout.

1064
01:23:28,700 --> 01:23:31,790
This is the first fun I've had in weeks!

1065
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:36,710
- Oh, Lord.
- Letty, my hair. Where is it?

1066
01:23:36,920 --> 01:23:41,010
"Look at them, the
little, small things."

1067
01:23:41,220 --> 01:23:46,470
That's it! You dreadful, awful,
monstrous creatures!

1068
01:23:46,680 --> 01:23:48,930
Take your hands off my children!

1069
01:23:49,140 --> 01:23:53,480
Cedric, it's over! I won't spend
another minute with this rabble

1070
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:56,980
and I don't care how much
the old hag is giving you.

1071
01:23:57,190 --> 01:23:59,820
Letty, the lambs!

1072
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:06,570
- This dress is ruined!
- Absolute carnage!

1073
01:24:06,780 --> 01:24:10,580
A nice choice for a
wife, I must say, Cedric.

1074
01:24:10,790 --> 01:24:13,660
I'm sorry. You gave me no time
to find anyone else.

1075
01:24:13,870 --> 01:24:16,420
As for your children, a lengthy spell...

1076
01:24:16,540 --> 01:24:19,340
in a corrective institution
is long overdue.

1077
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:22,050
And you, Evangeline, I can see...

1078
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:25,260
that you are as wild
as the rest of them.

1079
01:24:25,470 --> 01:24:28,010
And proud to be. I love
them, Lady Stitch,

1080
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,680
which is more than you do.

1081
01:24:29,890 --> 01:24:31,770
Insolence!

1082
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,810
I'd leave you here to rot,

1083
01:24:33,930 --> 01:24:36,850
but I gave my word
that I would raise you

1084
01:24:37,060 --> 01:24:41,070
and I never, ever, break my word.
Come away now.

1085
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:08,970
Wait, Aunt Adelaide! Wait!

1086
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,640
You agreed. You gave your word

1087
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:15,640
that if our father remarried this month,
you'd support us.

1088
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,520
I did.

1089
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:20,900
So if he marries today,
you'll have to keep your word.

1090
01:25:21,110 --> 01:25:23,650
- Oh, you're wasting my time!
- No.

1091
01:25:23,860 --> 01:25:26,700
No. No, I'm not.

1092
01:25:28,070 --> 01:25:30,120
- He will marry today.
- What?

1093
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:31,450
- What?
- What?

1094
01:25:31,660 --> 01:25:32,660
What?

1095
01:25:32,870 --> 01:25:37,420
- Who?
- He'll marry Evangeline.

1096
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,880
Incest?

1097
01:25:49,090 --> 01:25:53,060
No! No, Aunt Adelaide.
Evangeline isn't our sister.

1098
01:25:53,260 --> 01:25:55,810
- Not your sister?
- Of course she's not our sister.

1099
01:25:57,270 --> 01:25:59,400
Well, who is she, then?

1100
01:26:02,900 --> 01:26:05,360
I'm his scullery maid.

1101
01:26:05,570 --> 01:26:06,780
What?

1102
01:26:06,990 --> 01:26:10,320
Evangeline, do you love Papa?

1103
01:26:12,830 --> 01:26:17,330
Of course not. I know my place.
That wouldn't be right. I mean...

1104
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,750
Yes.

1105
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:29,470
Papa, do you love Evangeline?

1106
01:26:29,680 --> 01:26:31,890
What? That would be totally improper.

1107
01:26:32,090 --> 01:26:35,180
A thing like that
could...could never happen.

1108
01:26:35,310 --> 01:26:36,640
I mean, obviously...

1109
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:44,150
Yes.

1110
01:26:47,820 --> 01:26:51,320
He's marrying the scullery maid?

1111
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:52,820
Oh!

1112
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:45,170
It's snowing!

1113
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:48,130
Well, I never! Snow!

1114
01:27:48,340 --> 01:27:50,800
Snow in August!

1115
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:14,450
I take it, then, Mr Brown,

1116
01:28:14,660 --> 01:28:18,240
that the young lady
is not in fact the fruit of your loins?

1117
01:28:18,450 --> 01:28:23,870
Because the Church would have to take
a rather dim view of it if she were.

1118
01:28:24,080 --> 01:28:28,250
No. What happened was my son Simon
is a very clever boy.

1119
01:28:28,460 --> 01:28:30,000
Evangeline...

1120
01:28:30,210 --> 01:28:31,010
for the record,

1121
01:28:31,130 --> 01:28:33,510
whatever I may have
said about stepmothers,

1122
01:28:33,720 --> 01:28:35,680
that whole "evil breed" moment,

1123
01:28:35,890 --> 01:28:39,470
most emphatically does not apply to you.

1124
01:28:44,100 --> 01:28:46,230
This way.

1125
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:52,400
Jolly good. If I may then invite you all
to join us once more.

1126
01:28:52,610 --> 01:28:54,110
Hallelujah.

1127
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:58,870
Oh, Nanny McPhee... I'm so nervous.

1128
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:01,200
Deep breaths.

1129
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,460
I don't look much like a bride, do l?

1130
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:09,340
You will.

1131
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,180
How's the reading coming along?

1132
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:06,680
It's much better.

1133
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:09,980
But I still haven't got to the end
of that story.

1134
01:30:10,190 --> 01:30:14,900
No need. You are the end of the story.

1135
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:45,770
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together

1136
01:30:45,970 --> 01:30:49,850
to join together this man and this woman

1137
01:30:50,060 --> 01:30:53,270
in holy matrimony.

1138
01:30:58,990 --> 01:31:01,820
Make a loud noise and rejoice

1139
01:31:02,030 --> 01:31:04,240
and sing praise.

1140
01:31:20,630 --> 01:31:21,970
There is something...

1141
01:31:22,050 --> 01:31:24,800
you should understand
about the way I work.

1142
01:31:25,010 --> 01:31:30,060
When you need me but do not want me,
then I must stay.

1143
01:31:30,270 --> 01:31:34,190
When you want me but no longer need me,

1144
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,520
then I have to go.

1145
01:34:04,130 --> 01:34:06,010
Yoo-hoo!

1146
01:34:07,305 --> 01:35:07,819
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
