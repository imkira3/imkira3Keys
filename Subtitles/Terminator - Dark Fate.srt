1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,791
<i>It's like
a giant strobe light...</i>

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,834
<i>burning right through my eyes.</i>

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,236
<i>Somehow I can still see.</i>

4
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,955
<i>Children look like burnt paper...</i>

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,035
<i>black...</i>

6
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,474
<i>not moving.</i>

7
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,552
<i>And then the blast wave hits them.</i>

8
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,960
<i>And they fly apart like leaves.</i>

9
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,837
<i>Dreams of the end of the world</i>

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,990
<i>are very common.</i>

11
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,719
<i>It's not a dream, you moron.
It's real.</i>

12
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,793
<i>I know the date it happens.</i>

13
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,031
<i>I'm sure
it feels very real to you.</i>

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,550
<i>On August 29th, 1997,</i>

15
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,280
<i>it's gonna feel pretty fuckin' real
to you, too!</i>

16
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>Anybody not wearing two million sunblock
is gonna have a real bad day.</i>

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,113
<i>- Get it?
- Sarah...</i>

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,954
<i>God,
you think you're safe and alive?</i>

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,157
<i>You're already dead. Everybody.</i>

20
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,914
<i>Him, you! You're dead already!</i>

21
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,799
<i>This whole place,
everything you see is gone!</i>

22
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,349
<i>You're the one
living in a fucking dream!</i>

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,359
<i>'Cause I know it happened!
It happened!</i>

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

25
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,156
<i>There once was a future
in which humankind was hunted</i>

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,275
<i>by a machine that could think
and Terminators built to kill.</i>

27
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,316
<i>A future without hope.</i>

28
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,430
<i>That future never happened
because I stopped it...</i>

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,279
<i>...to protect my son</i>

30
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,119
<i>and to save us all.</i>

31
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,869
No!

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,035
No!

33
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,480
No.

34
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,400
No!

35
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,112
<i>Once I saved three billion lives...</i>

36
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,760
John!

37
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,559
<i>...but I couldn't save my son.</i>

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,114
John!

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,669
<i>A machine took him from me.</i>

40
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,670
<i>And I am terminated.</i>

41
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,949
Are you okay?

42
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,795
Okay, okay, okay.

43
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,720
Thanks, lady.

44
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,672
You just saved our asses.

45
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,679
Don't thank me yet.

46
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,956
Hey, little brother. Good morning.

47
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,154
I brought tamales and atole.

48
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,513
Well, if you want
to be big in America, you would say...?

49
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,309
I'm going to pass Bruno Mars...

50
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,680
pronto?

51
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
Good.

52
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,840
- Let's go.
- Okay.

53
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
Uh-huh.

54
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,751
Let's go, Diego.
We're running late.

55
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,117
- I had something going there.
- Yeah.

56
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,159
- I saw it.
- Come on.

57
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,072
You think I was
flirting with her too much?

58
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,720
I think all the parts
where you were talking were too much.

59
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,156
Funny.

60
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,440
Dani?

61
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:45,916
Mmm-hmm.

62
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,520
Hey, hey, hey!

63
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,599
There's a new guy at my station.

64
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,075
I see that.

65
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,596
Robot.

66
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,151
<i>Señor</i> Sanchez,
what's going on?

67
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Diego.

68
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,070
<i>Sí.</i>

69
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,389
I'll go.

70
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,589
- Take my spot.
- No, no, no.

71
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Dani Ramos.

72
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,914
How's the game?

73
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,839
Please, Mr. Grummond.
It's my brother.

74
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,116
But, Dani, he ain't you.

75
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,916
What's next?

76
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,792
3,000 people out there.

77
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,200
What happens if I tell them

78
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,351
they're just keeping
a spot warm for some machine?

79
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,193
That is not your father.

80
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,796
That is a machine that was
sent here to kill you.

81
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,872
- Let me go!
- You come with me

82
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,156
or you're dead in the next 30 seconds.

83
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,356
Come on.

84
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,240
Who are you?

85
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,840
I'm the person saving your life.

86
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,476
Dani!

87
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,320
Go, Dani.

88
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,589
Stay behind me!

89
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:34,880
Hey, lady!

90
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,716
Grace.

91
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,556
My name is Grace.

92
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,240
That won't kill it.

93
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,589
- We gotta go. Move!
- What?

94
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,756
- Go!
- Diego!

95
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,554
To where?

96
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:54,994
Keep going!

97
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,640
Come on!

98
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Here. This way.

99
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,315
Come on!

100
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,876
Hey!

101
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,240
Please!

102
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,879
Can you tell us what that thing is?

103
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,077
It's a Terminator. A Rev-9.

104
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,958
He was sent here from the future.
I was, too.

105
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,670
Get in.

106
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Get in!

107
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,754
Are you a machine, too?

108
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,069
No, I'm human like you.

109
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:29,117
But, uh, your arm...

110
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,919
I'm augmented.

111
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,795
- What?
- Augmented?

112
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,279
Fuck! Shit!

113
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,752
Oh, shit.

114
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,594
No!

115
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Faster! Go faster!

116
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:25,079
I know you're scared,
but I am here to protect you.

117
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Why us?

118
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,955
You, Dani. You're my mission.

119
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Me?

120
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,200
No, no, no!

121
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Look out!

122
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,634
Go faster! Go faster!

123
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,918
Fuck!

124
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,080
No! No!

125
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Oh, my God!

126
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,553
No!

127
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,353
Drive!

128
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,432
- What?
- Can you drive?

129
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,398
- No, I mean, I can't...
- I can! I can!

130
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,550
Yeah.

131
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,559
Hold it. Grace...

132
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,239
Dani, put your seat belt on.

133
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Diego...

134
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,032
Grace! Help me!

135
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,440
It's Diego!

136
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,840
Please! Take him out.

137
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Dani.

138
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,316
I can't.

139
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,119
What? No, no!

140
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,759
Don't. He will bleed out.

141
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,830
<i>Señor?</i>

142
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
Diego.

143
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,000
- Dani, we have to go.
- I'm not leaving him.

144
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,673
Take her. Save her.

145
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,636
- No!
- I'm sorry.

146
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,720
Please!

147
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
No.

148
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,720
- Diego!
- Dani!

149
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,559
Dani! Dani, stop!

150
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,074
Why did you do that?

151
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,629
We have to go, or he died for nothing.

152
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,354
- No.
- Come on.

153
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,116
Diego!

154
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Oh, shit.

155
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,756
When they start to kill me, run.

156
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,910
What?

157
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,200
I'll be back.

158
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,956
Who the fuck is that?

159
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,280
I don't know.

160
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,556
But we have to move.

161
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:33,040
Go.

162
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,560
We can't just...

163
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,256
- Grace, it's that lady's car.
- Dani, you go or it kills you.

164
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,430
It's that simple.

165
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,196
Son of a bitch!

166
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Dani...

167
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,240
I need some water.

168
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,195
If we can
maybe look in the back.

169
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,911
I wanna go home.

170
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,520
Take me home.

171
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,550
We're not doing that.

172
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,031
I have to tell my father about Diego.

173
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,840
It's not possible.

174
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,434
He doesn't know about Diego.

175
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,000
I need to see my father!

176
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,400
Your father is dead.

177
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,400
What?

178
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,160
It needs physical contact
to copy people.

179
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,912
And they don't survive.

180
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,160
No.

181
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,760
No.

182
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,840
What's wrong with you?

183
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I'm crashing.

184
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,400
You're burning up.

185
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:13,198
My metabolism was tuned for short,
intense bursts.

186
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,755
You either stop a Terminator
in the first few minutes...

187
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,560
or you're dead.

188
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,069
I need meds.

189
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,956
Hey!

190
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,035
Grace!

191
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
Wake up!

192
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,595
Where are you going?

193
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,120
Get back in the car.

194
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,320
I have to protect you.

195
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,555
You can't even walk.

196
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,154
I'm going to the police.

197
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,075
You do that, it'll find you.

198
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,472
You put a hundred cops
between you and a Terminator...

199
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,112
you'll get a hundred dead cops.

200
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,433
Dani, please.

201
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,833
Wait. Come here.

202
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,235
- You said you can't drive.
- Yeah.

203
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,234
I'll figure it out.

204
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,160
Hey!

205
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,440
Hey!

206
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,995
Grace, Grace!

207
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,117
It's okay. We're here.

208
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,200
Fuck, you're heavy.

209
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,360
We're here.

210
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,880
Grace.

211
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,512
I need any anticonvulsant.

212
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,195
Sodium polystyrene sulfonate,
insulin, benzodiazepine...

213
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,233
Do you have a doctor's prescription?

214
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,430
Here's my prescription.

215
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,950
What are you doing?

216
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,955
Fuck it.

217
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
Move.

218
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,635
It's okay.

219
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,680
Grace.

220
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,480
Grace.

221
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
Grace?

222
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,440
Grace.

223
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,480
I save your ass...

224
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,869
and you steal my truck. Nice.

225
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:10,800
I...

226
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,757
Never mind. It's burnt.

227
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,030
What's wrong with her?

228
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't know.

229
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,437
She's sick or something.

230
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,793
Well, I need answers from you two.

231
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,914
So let's get her in the car.

232
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,317
Give me that before you hurt yourself.

233
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,629
So, who are you?

234
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,993
Um, Daniella Ramos.

235
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,600
Dani.

236
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,156
I'm nobody.

237
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,316
Well, Dani, you must be somebody,
or they wouldn't have sent

238
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,711
whatever she is to protect you.

239
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,192
Hey, you got a phone?

240
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,476
- Yes.
- Could I see it for a sec?

241
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,200
Hey!

242
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,761
Might as well be
wearing a tracking bracelet.

243
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,596
When I'm ready to kill that thing,
then I'll let it know where we are.

244
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,913
We should have done this in the bathtub.

245
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,719
Have you seen the bathtub?

246
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,280
Uh-uh.

247
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,712
I keep my cell phone in the chip bag.

248
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:48,319
The foil blocks the GPS signal
so they can't track me.

249
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,320
Who's trying to track you?

250
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,358
I'm wanted in a couple of states.

251
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,834
50, actually.

252
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,074
But why 10 bags?

253
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,430
Because I really like potato chips.

254
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,440
Her meds...

255
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,792
how do you know how much of each to use?

256
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,156
I don't.

257
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,353
No one will know who he is.

258
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Who?

259
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,790
My brother.

260
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,400
He was in the truck when...

261
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,953
Who will be there to bury him?

262
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,114
Or my father?

263
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:13,869
No funerals.

264
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,632
No one there to say goodbye.

265
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,513
Funerals don't help them.

266
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,951
And goodbyes don't help you.

267
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,196
You just have to learn to live with it.

268
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,635
<i>Come in, base.</i>

269
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,878
<i>This is Dragonfly Three
requesting close air support.</i>

270
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:43,196
We are five klicks out,
carrying wounded precious cargo. Over.

271
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,040
<i>Roger that, Dragonfly Three.</i>

272
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,234
<i>Be advised there are hostiles
inbound on vector five.</i>

273
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,998
The trauma crew is standing by
for the commander at the south tunnel.

274
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,279
We have Rev-7s in pursuit.
Weapons free.

275
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,556
Let's move!

276
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,393
We got 30 seconds.

277
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,830
- Get off there now! Move back!
- Go!

278
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,994
Incoming!

279
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,800
You get the commander inside.

280
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:57,950
Okay.

281
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,270
You three, with me!
Hold them back!

282
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,433
Come on!

283
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,200
Look out!

284
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,156
We're being overrun!
We need reinforcements now!

285
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,080
Cover her!

286
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,715
Move! Coming in!

287
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,436
Shit!

288
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,752
She's got multiple stab wounds.
A lot of chest trauma here.

289
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,616
Let's get these holes sealed up.
Get a chest tube in the right side.

290
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,800
- This is gonna hurt like a motherfucker.
- Wait, wait.

291
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,876
No!

292
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,756
- Here.
- No, no!

293
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,680
I need to protect your commander.

294
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,176
The commander is safe, thanks to you.

295
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,078
Don't worry, soldier. You'll make it.

296
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,034
I volunteer.

297
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,440
Make me an Augment.

298
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,798
Midline sternotomy
with manubrial splitting.

299
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,759
Lung deflation
and cardiac localization.

300
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,998
Okay, let's gear up.

301
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,676
Sarah?

302
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,760
Talk.

303
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,636
Talk fast.

304
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,236
You first.

305
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,470
Get off me.

306
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
Sarah!

307
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,711
Hey, Sarah! Open the door.

308
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
Dani!

309
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,936
- You okay?
- Yeah, you okay?

310
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,960
Yeah.

311
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,400
What happened?

312
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,634
Locked me out of the room?

313
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:17,760
Sometimes mommies and daddies
have to have grown-up discussions.

314
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,113
So you're here to protect her.

315
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,676
What are you?

316
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,193
Never seen one like you before.

317
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,559
Almost human.

318
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:31,915
I am human.

319
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:33,910
Just enhanced.

320
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,116
You know, increased speed and strength,
thorium micro-reactor.

321
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,318
Which means I can rip your throat out
if you piss me off, so don't.

322
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,840
When are you from?

323
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,630
2042.

324
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,596
Your turn.

325
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,718
My name is Sarah Connor.

326
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,274
When I was about her age...

327
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,592
a Terminator was sent to kill me

328
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,551
to stop the birth of my son, John.

329
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,353
Leader of the Resistance.

330
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,275
Which resistance?

331
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,597
The human resistance.

332
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,680
Against Skynet?

333
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,593
The AI that's trying to wipe us all out?

334
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,154
I've never heard of it.

335
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,996
Good.

336
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,360
John and I changed that.

337
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,760
We changed the future.

338
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,478
Saved three billion lives.

339
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,874
You're welcome.

340
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,555
Where's your son now?

341
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,278
Skynet had sent several
Terminators to hunt him.

342
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,517
One finally caught up with us...

343
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,479
and carried out orders from
a future that never happened.

344
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,836
Since then...

345
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,272
I hunt Terminators.

346
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,829
And I drink till I black out.

347
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,759
Enough of a résumé for you?

348
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,160
No.

349
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,520
How did you know
we'd be on that freeway?

350
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,431
Interview's over. We gotta move.

351
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,360
We?

352
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,600
There is no "we."

353
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,195
Dani's with me.
It's my mission to protect her.

354
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,280
Oh, yeah?

355
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,999
How's that working out for you?

356
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,636
Clearly you don't know
everything about this time.

357
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,318
How anyone with a phone
is a walking sensor platform.

358
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,475
How every intersection,
every gas station

359
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,199
and 7-Eleven has cameras.

360
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:06,994
Nobody walks through this world

361
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,356
without leaving a digital trail
a mile wide.

362
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,717
And my guess is that
Terminator hunting her

363
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,031
can access that data anytime.

364
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,192
You two won't last 10 hours.

365
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,696
Let's get something straight.

366
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,838
If you put her in danger
or you get in my way,

367
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,752
I will fuck you up.

368
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,280
Right.

369
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,189
I drive.

370
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,959
So, that machine...

371
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,800
who sent it?

372
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,913
I can't fight it if I don't know
what we're up against.

373
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,354
It's a Rev-9 model.

374
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,760
You don't fight it.

375
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:07,356
You run from it.

376
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,280
Yeah, but who sent it?

377
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,956
Not who.

378
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,758
What. And it wasn't some...

379
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
Skynet thing.

380
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,431
In the future that actually happened...

381
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
it's called Legion.

382
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,680
Legion.

383
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,797
An AI built for cyber warfare.

384
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,431
Those assholes never learn.

385
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,000
And it attacked.

386
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,639
- Attacked who?
- Us.

387
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,360
Everybody. Humanity.

388
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:41,190
Sarah, how did you know
we would be on that bridge?

389
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,080
I get these texts.

390
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:52,598
Precise GPS coordinates, dates,
times, down to the second.

391
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,636
They always end with the same two words.

392
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,910
"For John."

393
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,360
So I pack up every weapon I've got,

394
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:06,673
and I head to those coordinates
to kill whoever is messing with me.

395
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:12,832
The air splits open above a parking lot
and a Terminator drops out.

396
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,710
So I destroy it.

397
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,229
And then two years later, same thing.

398
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:22,758
Location, time, date, "For John."

399
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,754
I frag that one, too.

400
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,999
And last week, I get two texts,

401
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,992
both in Mexico City.

402
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,037
Did you ever find out
who sends those texts?

403
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,909
No. They're always encrypted.

404
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,313
Do you still have them on your phone?

405
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:40,120
Dani.

406
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:50,520
What are you doing?

407
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,755
Future shit.

408
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,599
What's wrong? What is it?

409
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,400
These texts
came from outside Laredo.

410
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,917
Two days ago,

411
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,959
my commander had them tattoo
these coordinates on me.

412
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,400
As if I couldn't remember shit.

413
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,314
Told me to go here in case
anything went sideways with my mission.

414
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,312
It's the same location
your texts come from.

415
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,034
Whoever sent you these texts

416
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,589
is the same person
I was told to go to for help.

417
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,120
What does it mean?

418
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,399
It means we're going to Texas.

419
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:29,599
You wanna cross the U.S. border

420
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,149
with an undocumented Mexican national

421
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:35,677
and a woman who had her own episode
on <i>America's Most Wanted?</i>

422
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,472
I know someone who can get us across.

423
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Someone you trust?

424
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,240
Yes. My uncle.

425
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,435
Well, we need to ditch the car.

426
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:49,440
Get off the grid.

427
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:17,119
Why do you care what happens to her?

428
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,596
Hey, ladies.

429
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,714
Because I was her.

430
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,359
And it sucks.

431
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:27,874
Let's go.

432
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:41,117
Well, this is off the grid,
all right.

433
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,596
But I wish it wasn't so crowded here.

434
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,231
Well, I wish you two weren't so white.

435
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,435
Let's go, <i>chicas.</i>

436
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,550
<i>Gracias.</i>

437
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,720
Grace, tell me what happens

438
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:18,839
when this all falls apart.

439
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:24,515
Nothing happens.

440
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,070
There's no warning.

441
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,712
Day one, everything just stops.

442
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:34,636
No phones, no power. Cities go dark.

443
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,479
Grace, stay there.

444
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,875
<i>They told us</i>

445
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:42,675
<i>we had to leave,</i>

446
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:46,478
<i>just until things got back to normal.</i>

447
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:04,956
But normal was never coming back.

448
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,040
Day two, they launched nukes.

449
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:15,793
They thought they could contain Legion
with tactical EMP strikes.

450
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,796
And by day three,
the whole world was at war.

451
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,395
Millions died.

452
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:33,234
And then,
when the food ran out, billions.

453
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:42,073
Some men killed my dad
over a can of peaches.

454
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,960
I'm sorry.

455
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:51,312
When we thought the worst was over,
then Legion started to hunt survivors.

456
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,800
We know you got food, kid.

457
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:33,080
Give it up.

458
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:46,476
I don't know how I made it
through the next few years.

459
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,878
I just try not to think about it.

460
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:52,069
But I got lucky.

461
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,155
Someone found me,

462
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:57,829
saved me,

463
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:03,191
and then we started fighting back.

464
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,000
And let me guess.

465
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,355
Dani gives birth
to the one man that can stop it.

466
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,955
- What?
- The future wants you dead

467
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:19,236
for the same reason it wanted me dead.

468
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,798
But I'm nothing. I'm nobody.

469
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,714
Yeah, you're not the threat.

470
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,234
It's your womb.

471
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,589
Fine.

472
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:37,479
Let someone else be
Mother Mary for a while.

473
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:39,836
If you're Mother Mary,

474
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,832
why do I so wanna
beat the shit outta you?

475
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,360
Dani!

476
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,078
My clients get across safely.

477
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:08,553
To a better life.

478
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:11,838
I don't leave them to die in the desert
as some others do.

479
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,355
Can you get us across the border?

480
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:20,270
Forgive me, but gringas
are not my usual clientele.

481
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,791
You two do something illegal maybe?

482
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,311
Something my Dani doesn't wish to say?

483
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,159
<i>Tío,</i> there's...

484
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:36,640
This is going to sound crazy,

485
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:39,598
but there's a machine out there.

486
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:40,800
A robot.

487
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,359
It's what killed <i>Papi</i> and Diego,
and it wants to kill me.

488
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,320
We have to get away from it.

489
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,156
That's a new one.

490
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:00,319
Grace is part machine, too.

491
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,515
This way, ladies.

492
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,880
Hey, fellas.

493
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:35,996
What's up?

494
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,800
Ain't that just like
the Border Patrol.

495
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:47,039
Five minutes late,
and neglects to bring us donuts.

496
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:49,231
Terrance, shut the fuck up.

497
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,056
<i>Griffin 33 in contact</i>

498
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,390
<i>with intersection
due west of the Greene Bridge.</i>

499
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,558
<i>9-11 Griffin 33 wilco.</i>

500
00:54:20,440 --> 00:54:22,875
<i>Griffin 339-11,
that is your target.</i>

501
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
Almost there.

502
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:43,160
One more kilometer to the river.

503
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:44,200
Wait.

504
00:54:46,840 --> 00:54:47,876
Take cover.

505
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:52,240
There's a drone up there.

506
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,400
I don't hear anything.

507
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,480
Yeah, well, you're not an augmented
super soldier from the future, are you?

508
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,070
We have to hurry.

509
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:04,594
Attention, all patrols.

510
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,592
Be advised, new coordinates issued.

511
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:10,995
<i>Suspects are now
220 meters south of Checkpoint 7-Bravo.</i>

512
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,276
<i>They are known members
of the Sinaloa Cartel.</i>

513
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,590
<i>Wanted by American
and Mexican authorities.</i>

514
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:21,557
<i>They should be considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

515
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,399
Deadly force is authorized.

516
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:32,736
When you reach the wall,

517
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,479
there's a door beneath.

518
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:35,875
Flacco will show you the way.

519
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,194
I will go first.

520
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,080
Oh, shit.

521
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,274
<i>Stop! U.S. Border Patrol.</i>

522
00:56:12,360 --> 00:56:14,238
<i>Put your weapons on the ground.</i>

523
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:18,189
We get locked up,
it comes for her, she's dead.

524
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,496
<i>I'm not gonna tell you again!</i>

525
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,000
<i>Put them on the ground!</i>

526
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:25,469
Okay.

527
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,040
Dani! Dani!

528
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:29,635
They can shoot me,
but I'm not watching you die.

529
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,190
It's okay.

530
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,918
If they separate me from her,

531
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,476
- please get her out of there.
- All right.

532
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,234
<i>Walk forward
and away from your weapons.</i>

533
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:51,430
<i>Get on the ground!</i>

534
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,076
Get up, move it.

535
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,560
- You get them?
- Yep.

536
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,656
<i>We have one male suspect</i>

537
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:23,558
<i>and three female suspects in custody.</i>

538
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,790
- Dani!
- Hey!

539
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,116
We need help here!

540
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,416
Sorry, but I don't
have time for this shit.

541
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,079
And it's not my problem.

542
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,992
I need basic information.

543
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,720
Name, age, country of origin.

544
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:14,560
It's the truth, ma'am. I swear it.

545
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:18,951
This machine, it killed
my brother and my father,

546
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,236
- and now it wants to kill me, and he...
- Uh-huh.

547
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,754
Please! Officer, you have to believe me.

548
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:26,600
You're in danger, too.

549
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,397
No. I'm in Processing.

550
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,318
You ought to save your story
till you get where you're going, honey.

551
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,200
Heart rate slightly elevated.

552
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,316
Lungs are clear.
Let's get that wound exposed.

553
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,035
Trachea's midline.

554
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,640
Let's check for any exit wounds.

555
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,793
Nice body search, fellas.

556
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:08,755
What is that?

557
00:59:10,520 --> 00:59:11,920
I've never seen anything like this.

558
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:13,716
Let's get some pictures.

559
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:18,480
<i>That's confirmed.
We have eyes on it now. Go ahead.</i>

560
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,350
Hey.

561
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,513
I just got TDY'd here
to pick up a new detainee.

562
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,434
- Where they being held?
- Check in with the desk sergeant.

563
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,796
- He'll direct you.
- Thank you.

564
00:59:52,440 --> 00:59:53,635
Evenin'.

565
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,189
Supposed to pick up a detainee.
Dani Ramos.

566
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,476
Please locker your weapon.

567
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:07,320
What's been done to her?

568
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,512
How is she even alive
with all this stuff in her?

569
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,478
Expect a big ping, brother.

570
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,154
My whole body's a weapon.

571
01:00:17,240 --> 01:00:19,280
Save it for the ladies.

572
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:22,392
Sorry. Metal hip.

573
01:00:22,800 --> 01:00:24,120
Two tours in Afghanistan.

574
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:27,673
All right. Thank you for your service.

575
01:00:31,600 --> 01:00:32,600
Psst.

576
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,635
Connor.

577
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,359
Sarah Connor.

578
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,399
I'm Officer Rigby.

579
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:46,675
It's an honor.

580
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:53,919
Hey, guess what.

581
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:56,149
You're famous.

582
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:58,512
And we don't get
a lot of famous around here.

583
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:01,520
Let's go.

584
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,712
You belong in your own private cage.

585
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:07,275
I want to go, too!

586
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:34,830
Hey! Catch her!

587
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:47,911
Did I say you can
look at my private parts?

588
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,216
Where do they take the new prisoners?

589
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,038
They're called detainees and we...

590
01:01:55,840 --> 01:01:58,833
They're taken to the south end
holding area for processing...

591
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,038
Thanks.

592
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:41,675
Right this way, ma'am.

593
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,355
Our senior living section
is on the second floor.

594
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,720
Hey!

595
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:22,835
Grace! Grace!

596
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,798
- You okay?
- He's here. We gotta go.

597
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:28,798
Get back! Everybody, get back!

598
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,440
Come on.

599
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:11,120
Get in!

600
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:18,109
We gotta go.

601
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:22,154
There's Sarah. She's coming.

602
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,635
- There's no time.
- What?

603
01:04:28,560 --> 01:04:30,119
No! I'm not leaving her!

604
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:32,560
Dani!

605
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:38,550
Sarah, run!

606
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,720
- Sarah, get her!
- Get in!

607
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,399
Dani, you need to understand something.

608
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,758
You can't do stupid shit like that.

609
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:14,036
You cannot put yourself at risk.

610
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:16,271
- He would have killed Sarah.
- That doesn't matter!

611
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:17,994
When are you gonna get it?

612
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:22,151
Everybody dies
if you don't make it.

613
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,480
She's right.

614
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,589
What?

615
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:40,510
Hey there, fellas.

616
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,560
Y'all come to see the shitshow?

617
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,150
What the hell happened here?

618
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,951
Detainee got loose,
unlocked all the cages,

619
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,474
just chaos from there.

620
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:51,159
I don't mind tellin' you,

621
01:05:51,240 --> 01:05:53,440
I prayed more in five minutes
than I have my whole life.

622
01:05:54,040 --> 01:05:55,190
Heard that.

623
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,756
Say, you boys know where I can
get my hands on a chopper?

624
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,154
We're over the coordinates.

625
01:06:11,160 --> 01:06:12,594
Land a klick short.

626
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:39,351
So, Carl? That's the plan?

627
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:42,319
Carl's the mystery texter.

628
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:09,995
<i>No!</i>

629
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:12,120
<i>No!</i>

630
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,675
Sarah Connor.

631
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,109
Sarah!

632
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:20,829
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

633
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,149
What the fuck are you doing?

634
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:23,949
- Let me have it!
- No.

635
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,111
Sarah, you need to calm down.

636
01:07:26,240 --> 01:07:27,993
That thing killed John!

637
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:31,879
- Is that true?
- Yes.

638
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:34,400
But I'm not what you think I am.

639
01:07:34,440 --> 01:07:36,557
I'll kill you, you motherfucker!

640
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:37,680
Sarah, Sarah.

641
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:39,513
- If this man can help us...
- Not a man.

642
01:07:39,840 --> 01:07:40,990
A Terminator.

643
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,276
Shoot him in the face
and see what's underneath!

644
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:45,714
I don't care what he is!

645
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:48,710
Please.

646
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,833
- So you're a...
- Yes.

647
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:10,957
Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.

648
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,600
May I ask what you are?

649
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:15,800
No.

650
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,356
Sarah?

651
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:54,999
I don't have a photograph of John.

652
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:01,999
I never took any.

653
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:08,479
I thought that...

654
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:14,640
they couldn't find him...

655
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,192
if they didn't know what he looked like.

656
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,310
But now I'm forgetting his face.

657
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:29,269
I'm sorry.

658
01:09:35,480 --> 01:09:36,880
So why is the girl targeted?

659
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,196
You don't need to know.

660
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:42,160
Well, can you at least tell me
how you found me?

661
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,156
Who gave you that?

662
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,436
Thanks.

663
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,672
- Please sit down.
- Cut the shit.

664
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:31,635
Nice family.

665
01:10:32,240 --> 01:10:34,072
She a Terminator, too?

666
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:38,796
That's your little Terminator kid?

667
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:40,715
His name is Mateo.

668
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:45,110
I met his mother, Alicia,
a few months after I killed John.

669
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:47,157
Oh, you don't get to say his name.

670
01:10:48,280 --> 01:10:49,350
Ever.

671
01:10:53,480 --> 01:10:54,960
Her husband had beaten her.

672
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,760
He was trying to kill her child.

673
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:58,760
She had nowhere to go.

674
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:02,431
Caring for this family gave me purpose.

675
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,957
'Cause without purpose, we are nothing.

676
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,919
Touching story. Does it have a point?

677
01:11:08,880 --> 01:11:11,236
While raising Mateo, my son,

678
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,756
I began to understand
what I had taken from you.

679
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:17,150
Wait. You grew a conscience?

680
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:20,479
The equivalent of one, yes.

681
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,473
It's an infiltrator.

682
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,155
It's lying.

683
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,553
When my mission was completed,
there were no further orders.

684
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,716
So for 20 years, I kept learning
how to become more human.

685
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:34,430
So what about the texts?

686
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,116
When chronal displacement occurs

687
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:40,193
there's a shockwave through time
measurable before the event.

688
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,954
That's how, not why.

689
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:44,633
To give you purpose, Sarah.

690
01:11:45,480 --> 01:11:47,560
I thought it would bring
meaning to your son's death.

691
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,315
You know what would
give meaning to his death?

692
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:00,236
No, Sarah!

693
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:08,116
This will be very hard
to explain to Alicia.

694
01:12:08,200 --> 01:12:10,237
It's a Terminator!

695
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,277
And we are fighting a Terminator.

696
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:14,192
One that we can't stop.

697
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:19,673
Do you believe in fate, Sarah?

698
01:12:20,600 --> 01:12:22,717
Or do you believe that we all
can change the future

699
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,837
every second
by every choice that we make?

700
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:28,717
You chose to change the future.

701
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:33,070
You chose to destroy Skynet.

702
01:12:34,280 --> 01:12:35,680
You set me free.

703
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,800
And now,

704
01:12:39,720 --> 01:12:41,791
I'm going to help you protect the girl

705
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:44,634
because I choose to.

706
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,516
That's Alicia.

707
01:12:53,360 --> 01:12:55,033
She needs my help with the groceries.

708
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,873
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.

709
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,519
We have company.

710
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:06,920
Company? Who?

711
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,274
Was there enough hot water?

712
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:19,834
- Yes, thank you.
- Thanks.

713
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,236
Here you go.

714
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:27,951
Carl, your friends look hungry.

715
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:31,794
Would you like some sandwiches
and chips or something?

716
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,032
That's a great idea, Alicia.

717
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:40,674
Mateo, why don't you go
and help your mother?

718
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,319
Sure, Dad. I'm on it.

719
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,554
So, you're Carl.

720
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,673
That's what everyone calls me, yes.

721
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:56,195
I'm never gonna fucking call you Carl.

722
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:01,709
They don't know?

723
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,160
- No.
- She hasn't noticed that

724
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:08,436
you weigh 400 pounds?

725
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:10,034
That you never sleep?

726
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:11,713
Our relationship is not physical.

727
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,157
She appreciated
that I could change diapers.

728
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,352
Efficiently and without any complaints.

729
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:20,112
I am reliable, I'm a very good listener

730
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:22,400
and I'm extremely funny.

731
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,119
Okay.

732
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,074
How do we stop this thing?

733
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,956
We choose our weapons and our ground,

734
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:34,559
we set up a kill box,

735
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,359
and then we use Dani to bring it to us.

736
01:14:36,440 --> 01:14:38,557
- What?
- And then we take it down.

737
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,553
No. No way. Dani is not bait.

738
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:42,710
Sarah is right.

739
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:46,555
Our one tactical advantage is that
the Terminator only sees its mission.

740
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,595
Wherever Dani goes, he will follow.

741
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,956
Damn right it will. And I will be there.

742
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,590
Well, I'm not about to stake her out
like some goat for you.

743
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:57,677
What's your plan?
More running?

744
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,958
My plan is to hide her at the bottom
of a mineshaft if I have to.

745
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,480
- At least until I...
- Just stop it!

746
01:15:03,240 --> 01:15:05,277
I'm not hiding
at the bottom of a mineshaft.

747
01:15:08,680 --> 01:15:10,911
I'm not gonna live in fear
the rest of my life.

748
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,310
Even if your plan means
that might not be long.

749
01:15:15,480 --> 01:15:17,631
I want to stand and fight.

750
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,314
So, we choose our weapons
and our ground.

751
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:23,870
We're gonna set up a...

752
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,794
- Kill box.
- Kill box.

753
01:15:26,280 --> 01:15:28,511
And then,
we're gonna use me as bait.

754
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:31,432
And then, we kill that thing.

755
01:15:33,240 --> 01:15:34,240
Okay?

756
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:37,476
This plan has a high probability
of success.

757
01:15:43,880 --> 01:15:44,880
Okay.

758
01:15:47,520 --> 01:15:48,520
What weapons?

759
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:11,394
You just keep these around?

760
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,470
Even without a rogue AI taking over,

761
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:16,791
I calculate a 74% chance

762
01:16:16,880 --> 01:16:19,315
that human civilization
will collapse into barbarism.

763
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,439
And in that eventuality,

764
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:24,194
these weapons will be vital
to protect my family.

765
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:26,800
Also...

766
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:29,640
this is Texas.

767
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,476
Go. Rapid fire.

768
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,913
You're anticipating the recoil.

769
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:51,039
Put your weight forward, arms up.

770
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:52,916
And wider stance.

771
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,136
Don't lock out your elbows.

772
01:16:54,160 --> 01:16:55,389
Enough of this bullshit.

773
01:16:55,480 --> 01:16:56,834
Let's get serious.

774
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:07,397
A Terminator has just killed
your whole family.

775
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:08,709
What do you do?

776
01:17:21,440 --> 01:17:22,954
You know these guns won't kill it.

777
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:24,914
They'll only slow him down.

778
01:17:26,640 --> 01:17:28,871
According to your description
of his capabilities,

779
01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:32,632
our best option is to secure
a military-grade energy weapon.

780
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:34,680
An EMP?

781
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,150
What is that?

782
01:17:37,240 --> 01:17:38,754
An electromagnetic pulse.

783
01:17:39,280 --> 01:17:40,600
If we had one close range,

784
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:42,080
it would fry a Rev-9.

785
01:17:43,080 --> 01:17:44,434
I might know a guy.

786
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,636
Air Force intelligence officer
out of Bingham.

787
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,712
It's 94 miles from here.
We should leave this afternoon.

788
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:54,240
Okay.

789
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,274
You've been tracking me?

790
01:17:57,280 --> 01:18:00,318
If you want to keep your phone
in a bag of potato chips,

791
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:02,631
then keep your phone
in a bag of potato chips.

792
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,456
Take good care of Mama.

793
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:29,630
I will.

794
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:31,480
You're gonna be okay.

795
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:11,834
What did you tell them?

796
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:15,874
I told them you coming here
makes this place unsafe for them.

797
01:19:17,120 --> 01:19:21,239
Also, the day I warned them
might come, has come.

798
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:24,393
My past has caught up with me.

799
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:27,800
And...

800
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,595
I won't be back.

801
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:38,870
Do you love them?

802
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:43,873
Not like a human can.

803
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,391
For many years
I thought it was an advantage.

804
01:19:50,280 --> 01:19:51,509
It isn't.

805
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:55,109
I'm sorry.

806
01:20:05,760 --> 01:20:06,910
I just want you to know

807
01:20:07,520 --> 01:20:09,989
that when Dani's safe
and this is all over,

808
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:12,794
I am going to kill you.

809
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,400
I understand.

810
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:30,920
There's much more to it
than just picking the right color.

811
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,914
It's the texture,
the weight of the material.

812
01:21:35,080 --> 01:21:37,276
- One wrong choice...
- Sarah, you okay?

813
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:39,511
...it can destroy
the look of the entire room.

814
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,616
- Fine.
- There was this one customer

815
01:21:41,640 --> 01:21:42,756
that came to me.

816
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,117
He wanted to have solid-color drapes
in a little girl's room.

817
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,714
I said, "Don't do it."

818
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,069
You need butterflies,

819
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:52,119
polka dots, balloons.

820
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,554
Stay put.

821
01:22:11,960 --> 01:22:14,316
Always good to see you, Major.

822
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,396
It's never good to see you, Connor.

823
01:22:18,560 --> 01:22:20,392
You got my birthday present?

824
01:22:29,600 --> 01:22:31,353
You know, Sarah,

825
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,511
I don't commit treason for just anybody.

826
01:22:35,760 --> 01:22:37,479
What's the range of the EMP

827
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:39,313
against a Class Four hardened target?

828
01:22:41,080 --> 01:22:42,230
Bodyguard?

829
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:44,796
I do drapes.

830
01:22:47,040 --> 01:22:49,919
He's part of my operations team.

831
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,834
And he should just shut the fuck up.

832
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,552
Major, what kind of helos
fly out of Bingham?

833
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:00,596
Black Hawks and Chinooks. Why?

834
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:02,950
He's found us.

835
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,720
Take cover!

836
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,952
Major!

837
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:25,029
We're in. Go.

838
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,995
Head for the base.
About two miles down this road.

839
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,400
It'll be on us again in a minute.

840
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:05,436
This is Major Dean,

841
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,997
361st Intelligence,
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance Group.

842
01:24:09,080 --> 01:24:10,878
<i>Declaring THREATCON Delta.</i>

843
01:24:11,320 --> 01:24:14,358
<i>I'm currently two miles south
of Bingham Air Base in a white van.</i>

844
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,393
<i>Headed for the west gate.</i>

845
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:19,439
<i>Pursued by hostiles
in a stolen police helicopter.</i>

846
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:31,350
Where are we going?

847
01:24:31,720 --> 01:24:33,552
Can't all those soldiers
back there help us?

848
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,474
They'll be able to slow it down,
but they can't kill it.

849
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:37,875
The C-5.

850
01:24:37,960 --> 01:24:39,189
Can you fly that?

851
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:40,430
Of course.

852
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:44,256
<i>You are entering unauthorized airspace.</i>

853
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:46,476
<i>Turn around now or we will open fire.</i>

854
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:50,640
Get ready.

855
01:24:57,560 --> 01:24:58,676
What the hell?

856
01:24:58,760 --> 01:24:59,760
Stand down!

857
01:25:00,560 --> 01:25:02,950
These people are district contractors.
Friendlies.

858
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:07,120
I'll do what I can to cover your backs
until you can get airborne.

859
01:25:18,440 --> 01:25:21,000
Hey, they're not clear!
Stop 'em!

860
01:25:34,880 --> 01:25:35,996
We have been reacquired.

861
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,600
Take cover!

862
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,194
Don't touch me.

863
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:23,400
I'm out.

864
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,440
Carl!

865
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:28,320
Sorry about your shed.

866
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:34,920
<i>Bridge 42,
this is Viper 16. Stay in tension.</i>

867
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:37,160
Hopefully they won't
shoot us down.

868
01:27:37,200 --> 01:27:38,736
<i>Noble Eagle Ops,
this is Viper 16.</i>

869
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:39,760
Where are we going?

870
01:27:39,840 --> 01:27:41,593
Figuring that out next.

871
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:44,354
But those Humvees are rigged
for parachute landing,

872
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,797
so we can punch out and then find
some remote spot to use the EMP.

873
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:49,715
We have a problem.

874
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:03,036
So, if we fight him without those,
can we win?

875
01:28:03,120 --> 01:28:07,000
Based on the weapons we have,
I estimate our chances at 12%.

876
01:28:11,200 --> 01:28:12,429
That's not zero.

877
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:14,396
It's not much better.

878
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:18,360
Then we have to find some more weapons
and we stick to the plan.

879
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,791
- We set the trap and then we can...
- No, Dani, you can't do that.

880
01:28:23,680 --> 01:28:24,750
Why?

881
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:27,912
Because my son is supposed
to save us all?

882
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,150
And until then, what?

883
01:28:30,120 --> 01:28:31,873
We just keep watching people die?

884
01:28:31,960 --> 01:28:33,456
The future of the human race
depends on you making it...

885
01:28:33,480 --> 01:28:35,312
I don't give a shit about the future.

886
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,676
Or what I'm maybe
supposed to do someday.

887
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:41,200
What matters
are the choices we make now.

888
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:46,551
I've seen that look
too many times before.

889
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:50,150
You knew me.

890
01:28:54,640 --> 01:28:55,756
In the future.

891
01:28:57,680 --> 01:28:58,680
Yeah.

892
01:29:01,360 --> 01:29:02,635
I know you.

893
01:29:03,840 --> 01:29:05,035
It was you...

894
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:09,835
who found me in the ruins
after Judgment Day.

895
01:29:10,840 --> 01:29:12,035
<i>You saved me.</i>

896
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:43,960
HKs.

897
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:48,998
Shoot me, and we'll all
be dead in 10 seconds.

898
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:52,590
This is what Legion wants us to do.

899
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:55,476
Kill each other.

900
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,232
We should be fighting the machines.

901
01:30:03,880 --> 01:30:06,600
What's the point?
We can't win.

902
01:30:06,680 --> 01:30:09,400
Legion didn't exist
until humans created it.

903
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:10,914
We made that thing.

904
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,030
We can destroy it.

905
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:17,630
Are we supposed to lie down and die
because some machine decided it?

906
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,235
Is that our fate?

907
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:22,829
Well, fuck fate.

908
01:30:44,560 --> 01:30:45,630
What's your name?

909
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,240
Grace.

910
01:30:57,120 --> 01:30:58,120
Grace.

911
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:00,589
I'm Daniella.

912
01:31:02,080 --> 01:31:03,080
Dani.

913
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:06,556
<i>You saved me</i>

914
01:31:08,080 --> 01:31:09,400
<i>and you raised me,</i>

915
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,914
<i>and you taught me to hope.</i>

916
01:31:18,040 --> 01:31:21,158
<i>Like you saved
and taught the others.</i>

917
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:28,311
<i>You turned scavengers into militias
and militias into an army.</i>

918
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:33,513
<i>We rose up out of the ashes
and we took our world back.</i>

919
01:31:36,520 --> 01:31:37,636
You taught us

920
01:31:39,680 --> 01:31:41,478
there is no fate

921
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:44,917
but what we make for ourselves.

922
01:31:50,640 --> 01:31:51,640
Dani,

923
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:58,079
you are not the mother
of some man who saves the future.

924
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:02,640
You are the future.

925
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,398
That's why Legion wants you dead.

926
01:32:10,400 --> 01:32:11,629
She's John.

927
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:19,755
You're John.

928
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,873
I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before.

929
01:32:24,200 --> 01:32:26,760
But you told me that
the Dani I'd meet in the past

930
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,150
couldn't handle it.

931
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,953
But you're not that Dani anymore.

932
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,480
<i>Delta Echo 12.</i>

933
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:37,189
<i>This is KC-320.</i>

934
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,036
<i>Ready to refuel.</i>

935
01:32:39,640 --> 01:32:40,640
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

936
01:32:45,640 --> 01:32:48,474
<i>Copy that, KC-320,
but aren't you a bit early?</i>

937
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,195
It's him.

938
01:32:54,280 --> 01:32:55,475
We gotta go. Now.

939
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:56,560
Strap in to the Humvee.

940
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,350
Grace!

941
01:33:56,840 --> 01:33:57,910
Dani!

942
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:06,830
Dani!

943
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:11,156
Fuck.

944
01:34:18,440 --> 01:34:19,920
Open the cargo bay.

945
01:35:05,480 --> 01:35:06,480
I'll get Sarah!

946
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:13,400
- Sarah! The door?
- It's jammed!

947
01:36:10,080 --> 01:36:11,309
Get the straps.

948
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,560
Shit!

949
01:36:58,160 --> 01:36:59,160
What's happening?

950
01:37:08,640 --> 01:37:10,438
Grace! Where is she?

951
01:37:10,920 --> 01:37:12,036
I don't see her.

952
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,998
Oh, fuck.

953
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:28,680
Got two more.
They're bringing 'em in.

954
01:37:29,760 --> 01:37:30,760
Guys!

955
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,560
What the shit?

956
01:37:55,080 --> 01:37:56,434
Oh, my God! Grace.

957
01:37:57,200 --> 01:37:59,280
- I thought you were dead.
- We're dropping too fast.

958
01:38:29,160 --> 01:38:31,277
Three, two, one!

959
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:36,074
- My God!
- Oh, shit!

960
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,750
Dani, get out.

961
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,797
- It's blocked!
- It's not gonna hold!

962
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,360
Hold on!

963
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:00,276
No!

964
01:39:06,800 --> 01:39:07,836
Sarah?

965
01:39:08,720 --> 01:39:10,757
- What is it?
- My shoulder.

966
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:12,716
It's dislocated.

967
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,760
So you're a doctor now?

968
01:39:17,680 --> 01:39:18,680
Fuck!

969
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:33,358
He's coming. We can't stay here.

970
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:39,350
Oh, shit.

971
01:39:42,960 --> 01:39:44,030
What is she doing?

972
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,431
No, no, Grace. Really?

973
01:39:49,560 --> 01:39:50,560
Strap in!

974
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:53,719
Right.
Otherwise it could be dangerous.

975
01:40:28,880 --> 01:40:30,678
Try to find the lights.

976
01:40:42,360 --> 01:40:43,360
Get down!

977
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:51,679
There's a parachute back there. Grab it.

978
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,956
We can tangle him up.

979
01:40:57,440 --> 01:40:58,669
Listen to me.

980
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:01,559
It comes, you pull this cord.

981
01:41:01,640 --> 01:41:02,710
This cord.

982
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,395
And then you swim past it
up to the surface.

983
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,120
Okay.

984
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:09,920
Okay.

985
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:05,960
Grace.

986
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,395
Where is it?

987
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:17,800
I don't know. I lost him.

988
01:42:17,880 --> 01:42:19,314
We can't stay here.

989
01:42:19,400 --> 01:42:20,754
We gotta go.

990
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:22,236
All right.

991
01:42:29,240 --> 01:42:30,879
Can you make it up there?

992
01:42:30,960 --> 01:42:32,076
I don't know.

993
01:42:44,840 --> 01:42:46,752
It's locked.

994
01:42:46,840 --> 01:42:47,990
Let me try.

995
01:42:57,800 --> 01:42:58,800
Grace.

996
01:43:00,120 --> 01:43:01,236
Wait.

997
01:43:02,720 --> 01:43:04,871
There's maybe another door.

998
01:43:07,920 --> 01:43:09,036
Shit.

999
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:11,910
Grace!

1000
01:43:14,320 --> 01:43:15,515
Dani, you have to run.

1001
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:19,036
- You have to run. We can't protect you.
- What?

1002
01:43:21,680 --> 01:43:25,435
I'm the only one of us
who can still throw a punch.

1003
01:43:27,320 --> 01:43:28,595
There's another weapon.

1004
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,040
What?

1005
01:43:31,120 --> 01:43:32,236
My power source.

1006
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:37,593
How do we get it out of you
without killing you?

1007
01:43:39,600 --> 01:43:41,353
- You can't.
- No!

1008
01:44:02,880 --> 01:44:03,880
What?

1009
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:27,360
You look terrible.

1010
01:44:27,880 --> 01:44:29,917
At least I still have all my face.

1011
01:44:31,960 --> 01:44:33,917
You left this on the plane.

1012
01:44:36,920 --> 01:44:38,274
I can't get through that door.

1013
01:45:13,160 --> 01:45:14,674
Come on! Hurry!

1014
01:45:17,440 --> 01:45:18,715
We have to move.

1015
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,280
He's not far behind.

1016
01:45:20,360 --> 01:45:21,430
No.

1017
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:23,993
We make our stand here.

1018
01:45:26,520 --> 01:45:28,512
This is our kill box.

1019
01:45:43,200 --> 01:45:44,554
Dani.

1020
01:45:49,480 --> 01:45:50,994
I'm not running!

1021
01:46:02,520 --> 01:46:03,749
Give me the girl.

1022
01:46:05,560 --> 01:46:06,676
No.

1023
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:12,393
You really should.

1024
01:46:13,600 --> 01:46:16,115
You and I were built
for the same purpose.

1025
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:18,599
And Legion is the only future.

1026
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:20,592
I came from a future like that.

1027
01:46:21,160 --> 01:46:22,355
It failed.

1028
01:46:25,360 --> 01:46:27,591
I know she's a stranger to you.

1029
01:46:29,520 --> 01:46:31,113
Why not just let me have her?

1030
01:46:31,200 --> 01:46:34,671
Because we're not machines,
you metal motherfucker.

1031
01:47:09,640 --> 01:47:10,640
Grace!

1032
01:47:10,760 --> 01:47:11,989
Hey! Hey!

1033
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:13,594
I'm over here!

1034
01:47:24,880 --> 01:47:25,880
Move.

1035
01:47:30,720 --> 01:47:31,870
Sarah!

1036
01:49:22,720 --> 01:49:23,720
Move!

1037
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:08,078
Where's Grace?

1038
01:50:08,480 --> 01:50:09,880
I don't know.

1039
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:13,790
Oh, there she is.

1040
01:50:14,800 --> 01:50:16,632
Grace! Grace!

1041
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:18,154
Are you okay?

1042
01:50:22,520 --> 01:50:23,590
Grace.

1043
01:50:49,320 --> 01:50:50,436
Sarah!

1044
01:50:58,640 --> 01:50:59,994
It's not dead.

1045
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:02,470
Wait. We gotta take you out of here.

1046
01:51:03,880 --> 01:51:06,270
Okay? Grace, let's go.

1047
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:08,634
My power source.

1048
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:11,310
Get it close,
and it'll fry his neural net.

1049
01:51:11,400 --> 01:51:12,754
Grace...

1050
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:15,716
I can't.

1051
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:17,757
Yes, you can.

1052
01:51:35,000 --> 01:51:36,480
Dani.

1053
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,756
This is what you sent me here to do.

1054
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:50,554
No.

1055
01:51:50,680 --> 01:51:52,717
We both knew I wasn't coming back.

1056
01:51:57,920 --> 01:51:59,991
- I can't.
- Dani, please.

1057
01:52:00,080 --> 01:52:01,560
You saved me.

1058
01:52:02,840 --> 01:52:03,956
Let me save you.

1059
01:52:08,480 --> 01:52:09,675
- Please.
- No.

1060
01:52:09,760 --> 01:52:10,760
You do it.

1061
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:13,120
Do it, Dani.

1062
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,354
I'm sorry, Grace.

1063
01:52:29,480 --> 01:52:30,914
I'm not.

1064
01:52:52,520 --> 01:52:54,239
I'm gonna kill you, fucker.

1065
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:22,870
Hey!

1066
01:53:23,280 --> 01:53:24,475
Get up!

1067
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:25,676
Help her!

1068
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:31,879
God damn it...

1069
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:32,960
Carl!

1070
01:53:33,040 --> 01:53:34,040
Wake up!

1071
01:55:12,440 --> 01:55:13,635
For John.

1072
01:56:22,640 --> 01:56:24,074
We got him, Grace.

1073
01:56:29,000 --> 01:56:30,320
You saved me.

1074
01:56:47,320 --> 01:56:48,470
<i>Grace!</i>

1075
01:56:50,120 --> 01:56:51,395
Grace, come on, honey.

1076
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:52,675
It's time to go.

1077
01:57:03,720 --> 01:57:06,918
Come on, you two.
Grab your stuff, you guys.

1078
01:57:26,840 --> 01:57:28,638
I won't let her die for me again.

1079
01:57:30,880 --> 01:57:33,236
Then you need to be ready.

1080
01:57:34,305 --> 01:58:34,155
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
