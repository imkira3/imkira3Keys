2
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:09,152
Typical of Victor Von Doom to build
a 30-foot statue of himself.

3
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,780
Well, it's obviously aimed
at first-time visitors...

4
00:01:11,989 --> 00:01:15,200
to create feelings
of smallness, inadequacy.

5
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,453
Good thing it ain't working.

6
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:22,958
Reed, what are we doing here?
This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science.

7
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,377
This wasn't our first stop,
in case you forgot.

8
00:01:25,544 --> 00:01:29,715
Besides, Victor's not that bad.
He's just a little larger than life.

9
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,227
My research suggests that exposure
to a high-energy cosmic storm...

10
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:46,773
borne on solar winds might have triggered
the evolution of early planetary life.

11
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:52,362
In six weeks, another cloud
with the same elemental profile...

12
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,364
will pass Earth's orbit.

13
00:01:55,407 --> 00:01:59,244
A study conducted in space could
fundamentally advance our knowledge...

14
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:02,664
about the structure of the human genome,
cure countless diseases...

15
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:07,002
extend human life, give kids a chance
to live longer, stronger, healthier...

16
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,213
Turn it off, please.

17
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,715
I don't think I have explained
my proposal fully.

18
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,550
No, I think you have.

19
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,178
Same old Reed, always stretching,
reaching for the stars...

20
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,805
with the weight of the world on his back.

21
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,974
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?

22
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,105
You remember, when we were in school
we talked about working together.

23
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,733
Well, that's what I was about to explain.

24
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,528
The storm is deadly.

25
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,613
But the shields on
your station's control room...

26
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,324
are designed to protect
any occupants inside.

27
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,621
So it's not just my money you want.

28
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,456
It's my toys.

29
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,919
Tell me, if NASA doesn't trust you,
then why should I?

30
00:02:52,798 --> 00:02:55,342
That's my job, to stay a step ahead.

31
00:02:56,093 --> 00:02:59,263
To know what other men don't.

32
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,973
I can't take this.

33
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,058
Ben, this is business, just work.

34
00:03:03,225 --> 00:03:05,686
He's right, Ben. It is just business.

35
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:10,691
I think you both know my Director
of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

36
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,405
One more thing he's got.

37
00:03:16,947 --> 00:03:18,824
- Hey, Susie.
- Hey.

38
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:22,244
It's so nice to see you. How's Debbie?

39
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,954
- Great.
- Great.

40
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:28,542
- How have you been?
- Never better.

41
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,088
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?

42
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,381
- No.
- Not at all.

43
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:35,716
Good.

44
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:39,845
Then you're just in time
to hear the great Reed Richards...

45
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,264
ask me for help.

46
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:46,894
You know, you made a lot of folks at MIT
feel like a junior high science fair.

47
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,730
So you'll excuse me
if I savor the moment.

48
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,902
You back this mission and I'll sign over
a fair percentage of any application...

49
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,445
The number's 75%.

50
00:03:56,987 --> 00:03:58,530
And its applications and patents.

51
00:03:58,697 --> 00:04:00,741
- What about his first-born?
- Ben...

52
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,826
Come on.

53
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:07,080
25% of a billion is enough
to keep the lights on for a while, isn't it?

54
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,043
Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage
on the Baxter Building.

55
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,504
Deal?

56
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:24,890
Well, then. To our future.

57
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:28,727
Together!

58
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:32,898
It's funny how things turn out, isn't it?

59
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,234
Hilarious.

60
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:41,448
He knew about NASA.
Maybe he made the call to shut us down.

61
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,952
Ben, think about all the people
we can help if this works.

62
00:04:45,369 --> 00:04:47,746
Look, we got what we wanted.
That's enough.

63
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:50,749
A few days in space, it'll be great.
What's the worst that can happen?

64
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:59,258
If Reed's right, this little trip
could double our stock offerings.

65
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,802
- And if he's not...
- Reed's always right.

66
00:05:02,678 --> 00:05:05,305
Good thing he doesn't always know
what he's got.

67
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,526
Reed, you should know those solar winds
have been picking up speed.

68
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,361
I factored them into my coordinates.

69
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,780
Right, of course you did. In theory.

70
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,824
It's a little different once you're out there.

71
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:26,159
- I can assure you I...
- When are we leaving?

72
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:29,663
I'll be scheduling the launch...

73
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,833
so you can call me in the morning
for resources and crew.

74
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:36,295
- I think I remember the number.
- It's been changed.

75
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,888
As far as crew, I was hoping
Ben could pilot the mission.

76
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:49,516
We already have a pilot on our payroll,
but you're welcome to ride shotgun.

77
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,518
Remember my brother, Johnny?

78
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:10,913
Can't do it. Cannot do it.

79
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:14,750
External SRBs, orbital system engines,
it's just like the shuttle you flew.

80
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,920
No! I cannot take orders
from the underwear model.

81
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:20,339
- Come on now, Ben.
- That wingnut washed out of NASA...

82
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,051
for sneaking two Victoria's Secret
wannabes into a flight simulator.

83
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,802
Youthful high spirits.

84
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:29,598
They crashed it into a wall.
A flight simulator.

85
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,850
When have I ever asked you
to do something...

86
00:06:32,017 --> 00:06:33,644
you absolutely said you could not do?

87
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,770
Five times.

88
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,940
- I had it at four.
- Well, this makes five.

89
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:49,826
<i>Attention, all personnel. </i>

90
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,996
<i>Commencing launch sequence
in six hours. </i>

91
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,957
I miss you already, Debs.

92
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:56,750
Captain on the bridge!

93
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:03,298
Digital camera: $254. Memory stick: $59.

94
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,677
The look on your hard-ass
former CO's face...

95
00:07:06,844 --> 00:07:09,263
when he finds out he's your junior officer:

96
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:11,014
Priceless.

97
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,394
Thank you. That's so sweet.

98
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,187
I can handle the ship.

99
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,565
I can even handle Mr. Blond Ambition.

100
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,110
But I don't know whether I should be
flying or doing Swan Lake in these suits.

101
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:26,280
- I mean, who the hell came up with these?
- Victor did.

102
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:30,659
The synthetics act as a second skin,
adapting to your body's individual needs.

103
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:33,787
See, now that means
it keeps the hot stuff hot...

104
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:35,998
and it keeps the cool stuff cool.

105
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,709
Wow. Fantastic.

106
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,379
Material made from self-regulating
unstable molecules.

107
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,883
I've been working on a formula for this.

108
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,719
Great minds think alike.

109
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:54,224
- Here you go, Ben.
- Thanks, sweetie.

110
00:07:54,433 --> 00:07:55,601
Reed.

111
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,761
ETA until cosmic event: Nine hours.

112
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,972
If you're good, maybe next time
Daddy'll let you drive.

113
00:08:34,223 --> 00:08:36,850
You keep talking
and there won't be a next time.

114
00:08:40,103 --> 00:08:43,732
Long way from the projection booth
at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

115
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,489
Yes. Yes, it is.

116
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:55,786
We can monitor the cloud's approach
and observe the tests from here.

117
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:57,996
Is it safe?

118
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:01,083
The shields on the station
should protect us.

119
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,626
Should?

120
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,088
What's the matter, Ben?
Getting paranoid in your old age?

121
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,509
Let's start loading those samples.
Get your suit ready, Ben.

122
00:09:12,135 --> 00:09:14,847
So I see you're still doing
all the heavy lifting.

123
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:19,309
Maybe you should have stayed in the lab.
Fieldwork never suited you.

124
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,729
He does the talking, I do the walking.
Got it?

125
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:25,524
So take a walk, Ben.

126
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:30,612
Actually, if you'll all excuse me,
I need to borrow Susan for a moment.

127
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,451
Sure.

128
00:09:39,663 --> 00:09:42,749
Please tell me your guy's not trying
to rekindle things with my sister again.

129
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,169
Of course not. It's strictly business.

130
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,088
Yes, well, his eyes say differently,
don't they?

131
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,427
Two hearts got busted last time.
Maybe she's not over it, either.

132
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:56,930
Wow, Dr. Phil, that's deep.
Let's think about that.

133
00:09:57,472 --> 00:10:00,726
You got Victor, more money than God,
stud of the year.

134
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:06,023
And you got Reed, world's dumbest smart
guy, worth less than a postage stamp.

135
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,317
That's a real toss-up.

136
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,485
Don't trouble your tiny little mind.

137
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,779
Don't wander off now, boy.

138
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,242
<i>Securing airlock chamber. </i>

139
00:10:37,054 --> 00:10:39,264
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

140
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,433
I understand the business reasons.

141
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:45,187
Well, when you're looking at your future...

142
00:10:45,354 --> 00:10:47,856
it doesn't hurt
to find closure about the past.

143
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,196
Susan, every man dreams he'll meet
a woman he can give the world to.

144
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,450
In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

145
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,666
<i>Opening viewing station shield. </i>

146
00:11:35,821 --> 00:11:37,197
That can't be right.

147
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,911
<i>Event threshold
in T-minus 9 minutes, 47 seconds. </i>

148
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,039
That's impossible.
It should be seven hours.

149
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:53,005
We've been together two years now.

150
00:11:53,172 --> 00:11:56,717
It's been a good two years, Victor.
The company's accomplished so much.

151
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,886
Right, of course, the company.

152
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:04,224
But, you see, I've come to realize that
all the accomplishments in the world...

153
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:06,393
mean nothing without someone
to share them with.

154
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,230
I've lived my life
unafraid of taking big steps.

155
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,567
Now it's time to take the biggest step
of all.

156
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:18,197
- Victor.
- If it helps, think of this as a promotion.

157
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:21,658
- Victor, I...
- I have four words.

158
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,205
Four little words that can change
our lives forever.

159
00:12:26,413 --> 00:12:28,415
The cloud is accelerating.

160
00:12:28,582 --> 00:12:31,293
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours.

161
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:33,879
Victor, that storm is deadly.
We need to abort.

162
00:12:34,046 --> 00:12:37,549
Get a grip, Reed. We didn't come all this
way to lose our nerve at the first glitch.

163
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,842
Just close the shields.

164
00:12:38,926 --> 00:12:41,303
- Ben is still out there.
- So reel him in.

165
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,973
But we came here to do a job,
so let's do it quickly.

166
00:12:46,225 --> 00:12:49,394
Victor, Reed's right.
We have less than six minutes!

167
00:12:52,272 --> 00:12:54,942
- Ben, you need to get inside now.
- What's going on?

168
00:12:55,108 --> 00:12:57,402
<i>I ain't done
arranging your flowers yet, egghead. </i>

169
00:12:57,569 --> 00:12:58,987
<i>Ben, turn around!</i>

170
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,123
<i>Guys, I'm not gonna make it. </i>

171
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,209
Ben, you gotta jump. It's the only way!

172
00:13:17,673 --> 00:13:19,466
- What are you doing?
- Closing the shields.

173
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:22,010
- You can't just leave them out there.
- Watch me.

174
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,849
- You can't help them any more than I can.
- I can try.

175
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:43,824
Come on, Ben, you got it!

176
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,580
Okay, Johnny,
get ready to close the portal.

177
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:45,761
Wake up. Ben.

178
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,806
Rise and shine, big boy. How you feeling?

179
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:51,767
Where am I?

180
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,145
Back on Earth. We're in quarantine.
Victor's medical facility.

181
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,813
Reed? Sue?

182
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,525
They're fine. Everybody else is fine.

183
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,861
What's wrong with me?

184
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:07,282
I swear to you, Ben. They've done
everything humanly possible.

185
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:09,451
The best plastic surgeons
in the world are here, Ben.

186
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,661
You had the best.

187
00:15:10,744 --> 00:15:13,914
- Give me that mirror.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.

188
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,209
- They said the shock alone...
- I said give me that goddamn mirror!

189
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:20,337
Okay, Ben, just be strong.

190
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:28,679
Unfortunately, the doctors
just couldn't do anything to fix your face.

191
00:15:34,685 --> 00:15:35,686
- Hi.
- Hey.

192
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,689
Nice do. I'm liking the grandpa look.

193
00:15:39,523 --> 00:15:40,607
What?

194
00:15:58,834 --> 00:16:02,004
- How's she doing?
- Stable and her vitals are strong.

195
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,965
Blood panels show no irradiation. Good.

196
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:09,011
- You'll step up this protocol every...
- Every four hours, yes.

197
00:16:09,261 --> 00:16:10,846
We know what we're doing.

198
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,390
Another day of observation
and you're all clear.

199
00:16:13,557 --> 00:16:16,268
Excuse me.
More flowers from Mr. Von Doom.

200
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,523
She's allergic to orchids.

201
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:24,484
Put the sunflowers by her bed,
they're her favorites.

202
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:44,296
Well, Victor...

203
00:16:44,755 --> 00:16:46,840
the bank would like to congratulate you...

204
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,384
on the fastest freefall
since the Depression.

205
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,136
We can't even give your stock away.

206
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:52,804
Ned, you know I can turn this around.

207
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,849
Well, you're going to have to, Victor,
or we pull out.

208
00:16:58,477 --> 00:16:59,770
You have a week.

209
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:02,064
You're enjoying this, aren't you, Ned?

210
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,569
One week.

211
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,000
Where do we think we're going?

212
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:23,335
I don't know if we've noticed...

213
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:26,338
but the sickest runs this side of the Alps
are right outside that window.

214
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,007
Yeah, I've noticed,
but there are rules here.

215
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:31,426
- You can't leave until we...
- Until we've finish the tests.

216
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:35,806
I know, I've never been good with rules.
You let me know how those come out.

217
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,185
- Do you wanna help me with this zipper?
- You know, this is not a ski resort.

218
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:43,105
Not yet. Luckily, Grandma still sends
care packages, though.

219
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:46,525
You know, it's amazing, for an 80-year-old
woman, you'd be surprised...

220
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:49,820
- You are trouble.
- Trouble is my middle name.

221
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,154
You're hot!

222
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,365
Why, thank you. So are you.
And I'm not afraid to cry.

223
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:55,033
No, I mean, you feel a little feverish.

224
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:57,953
Well, I've never felt better in my life.
My God, you smell good.

225
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,122
Listen, when do you get off work?

226
00:18:00,372 --> 00:18:01,957
- 4:00, but I...
- Tell you what.

227
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:04,960
You meet me at 4:01
at the top of the mountain.

228
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,214
That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
This is yours, that's mine.

229
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:11,216
Nurses!

230
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,724
How long was I out?

231
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,017
Hey.

232
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:22,895
Three days. Man, I was worried about you.

233
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,230
- How are you feeling?
- Solid.

234
00:18:27,065 --> 00:18:29,234
- That was a close one, though, huh?
- Yeah.

235
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:31,695
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

236
00:18:33,113 --> 00:18:34,781
I really don't know.

237
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:38,535
I've been going over the figures
again and again and they all add up.

238
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,622
I just don't understand.
Maybe I should have aborted...

239
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:45,417
Reed, it was a freak of nature.
You couldn't have possibly predicted it.

240
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:46,793
Let it go.

241
00:18:50,047 --> 00:18:51,673
You know, you live through
something like this...

242
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,593
it really makes you appreciate
having the right woman in your life.

243
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:58,222
- Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect.
- I'm not talking about Debbie.

244
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,684
What? Come on.

245
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:04,978
She's got a good thing with Victor.

246
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,022
He's smart, he's powerful,
he's successful...

247
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,024
Well, maybe you should date him then.

248
00:19:09,191 --> 00:19:11,860
Ben, she ended up with the right guy.

249
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,613
Things worked out for the best.

250
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,244
Do I have to do everything myself?

251
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:42,933
All right.
I think you should stay to the right.

252
00:19:43,058 --> 00:19:44,852
The left might give you trouble.

253
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:47,563
- I think we should drop, like, 10 more feet.
- Good.

254
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:49,940
Last one down springs for room service!

255
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,616
That's my future wife.

256
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:27,561
You're losing!

257
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,480
All right, no more kid's stuff.

258
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:32,816
Check this out.

259
00:20:40,199 --> 00:20:41,658
You're on fire.

260
00:20:41,867 --> 00:20:43,410
Thanks! You're pretty good, too.

261
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,246
No, you're on fire. Look!

262
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:22,658
Care to join me?

263
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,168
I can only stay for one drink
'cause I have to meet Victor.

264
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,796
Well, wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

265
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:38,674
Reed, what are you doing here?

266
00:21:38,966 --> 00:21:40,092
I thought...

267
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:44,721
Great! Maybe you can join us.

268
00:21:45,806 --> 00:21:47,015
<i>How's the IPO now?</i>

269
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,184
It's falling. We're looking at low 20s.

270
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,311
It's a good number
considering the fallout from...

271
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,813
From Reed's disaster?

272
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:56,608
<i>Get me on the a. m. Shows,
Larry King, the cover of the Journal. </i>

273
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:00,445
I have to do something about this scar.

274
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,283
Make sure they only shoot me
from my left side.

275
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:07,619
Actually, the scar's tracking well.

276
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:10,038
People seem to think it humanizes you.

277
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:13,333
And that's a good thing?

278
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:19,047
You know,
maybe you should get some rest.

279
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,382
Later.

280
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:23,135
First, I have some unfinished business.

281
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,554
A deal that needs closing.

282
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:28,599
Sir, I have always wondered, why Sue?

283
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:31,435
You could have any other woman
in the world.

284
00:22:31,602 --> 00:22:34,563
That's why.
Because I could have any other woman.

285
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:38,567
- No, let me tell the story.
- No, let him tell the story.

286
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:49,703
- You all right?
- Yeah, bad shrimp.

287
00:22:50,954 --> 00:22:52,831
I think I better go lie down.

288
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:54,708
Excuse me.

289
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,377
Oh, God!

290
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,479
<i>So, you feeling better?</i>

291
00:23:16,271 --> 00:23:17,940
Yes, thank you.

292
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,525
Good.

293
00:23:20,776 --> 00:23:23,445
That's... good.

294
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,076
You always had a way with words.

295
00:23:33,997 --> 00:23:36,500
Wow. I should be going because...

296
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:40,087
I have to meet Victor.

297
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:42,381
I'm really happy for you and Victor.

298
00:23:43,632 --> 00:23:45,467
You're really happy for me and Victor?

299
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:49,012
I can tell you guys are enjoying
what was the best part of our relationship.

300
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,973
- Which was?
- Passion...

301
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,142
for science.

302
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,437
You're such a dork, Reed.

303
00:23:58,021 --> 00:23:59,523
You never got it...

304
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,276
- and you never will...
- Well, what did I say?

305
00:24:02,401 --> 00:24:04,361
...unless it's explained to you
in quantum physics.

306
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:05,696
I just wanted to let you know that I...

307
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,282
It's been two years,
and all you can say is that you're happy...

308
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:10,325
for me and some other guy?

309
00:24:10,617 --> 00:24:12,327
Victor may be a lot of things.

310
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:15,497
But at least he's not afraid
to fight for what he wants.

311
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,083
It's nice to be wanted sometimes, Reed.

312
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:22,754
To be seen and heard.

313
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,426
Look at me.

314
00:24:30,095 --> 00:24:31,138
I can't.

315
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:33,098
What do you mean, you can't?
Look at me!

316
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:34,975
Sue, look at your hands!

317
00:24:54,453 --> 00:24:56,121
Hey, you guys.

318
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,791
You are never gonna believe
what just happened to me.

319
00:24:59,958 --> 00:25:01,043
What?

320
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:04,546
Well, I can explain this.

321
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:35,244
It has to be the cloud.
It's fundamentally altered our DNA.

322
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:37,037
Let's not jump to conclusions.

323
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,957
We need a massive amount of evidence
before making that leap.

324
00:25:40,123 --> 00:25:41,667
Guys, look!

325
00:25:52,302 --> 00:25:55,347
Now, picture that, but everywhere.

326
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:58,642
It was everywhere.

327
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:00,769
What?

328
00:26:02,688 --> 00:26:05,107
The cloud has fundamentally altered
our DNA.

329
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,402
- Cool!
- We need to find Ben.

330
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:10,696
And you know what, guys?
I think I was flying.

331
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:19,121
I said, cut it out, Johnny.

332
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,664
I'm getting the hang of it.

333
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:22,875
- Ben, it's Reed.
- Stop.

334
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:24,418
- All right.
- All right?

335
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:25,878
- Yes.
- God!

336
00:26:25,961 --> 00:26:27,254
- God?
- What's wrong with you?

337
00:26:27,421 --> 00:26:28,547
- What?
- Sue, do you know the code?

338
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:29,673
I might.

339
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,099
Ben, open up.

340
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:40,267
You all right, Ben?

341
00:26:40,392 --> 00:26:42,394
Does somebody have keys to these doors?

342
00:26:43,395 --> 00:26:44,521
Anybody?

343
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:47,941
Just break the glass. It can't be that thick.

344
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:51,028
Give me another couple of seconds, guys.
I almost got it.

345
00:27:31,485 --> 00:27:32,611
That's gross.

346
00:27:38,742 --> 00:27:39,785
Ben?

347
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:41,954
Look.

348
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:46,750
What is that thing?

349
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:50,295
What's going on?

350
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:52,506
What happened in here?

351
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,132
Victor, are you feeling all right?

352
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,843
I'm fine. Just a few scrapes, that's all.

353
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,302
Ben did this.

354
00:27:57,427 --> 00:28:00,472
He's had some kind of reaction
to exposure from the cloud.

355
00:28:01,181 --> 00:28:03,475
We all have different symptoms.

356
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:04,768
Symptoms?

357
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:07,604
- Victor, I should have...
- Just find him.

358
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:13,193
Anybody got any ideas
where the big guy's going?

359
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:18,615
He's going home.

360
00:28:57,738 --> 00:28:59,698
You gotta be kidding me.

361
00:29:06,788 --> 00:29:08,040
Little buttons.

362
00:29:08,707 --> 00:29:10,167
Hello, Operator?

363
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:15,380
<i>- Hello?
- Debs?</i>

364
00:29:16,048 --> 00:29:17,591
<i>- It's me.
- Ben?</i>

365
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:21,053
<i>Are you all right?
You sound a little different. </i>

366
00:29:21,386 --> 00:29:24,097
<i>- Listen, I need you to come out front.
- Out front?</i>

367
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,308
<i>You're home, baby?</i>

368
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,268
<i>Yeah. </i>

369
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:32,523
<i>I got a surprise for you. </i>

370
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:37,361
Yeah, I got a little one for you, too.

371
00:29:41,281 --> 00:29:42,366
Ben?

372
00:29:45,786 --> 00:29:47,246
Where are you?

373
00:29:47,663 --> 00:29:49,081
I'm over here.

374
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,209
Don't come any closer for a sec, okay?

375
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,463
It's gonna be a bit of a shock.

376
00:29:56,672 --> 00:29:58,507
Honey, what's going on?

377
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,008
Debs...

378
00:30:01,218 --> 00:30:03,428
remember when we used to say...

379
00:30:03,846 --> 00:30:06,682
together forever no matter what?

380
00:30:07,641 --> 00:30:08,684
Yeah.

381
00:30:10,185 --> 00:30:11,478
Well...

382
00:30:11,854 --> 00:30:13,522
Baby, you're scaring me.

383
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:28,829
Oh, my God.

384
00:30:29,538 --> 00:30:32,207
Deb, it's me. It's still me.

385
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:34,168
It was the accident. Let me explain.

386
00:30:34,334 --> 00:30:36,420
- No! Don't touch me!
- Debs!

387
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,179
I'm calling the police.

388
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:46,346
Everybody all right?

389
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:48,932
I saw him. It's that guy over there!

390
00:30:57,149 --> 00:30:59,359
Okay, so he was there last night.

391
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:01,695
Debbie's gonna meet us
on the other side of the bridge.

392
00:31:16,418 --> 00:31:17,878
Yeah, Ben.

393
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,464
"A few days in space. It'll be great.

394
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,634
"What's the worst that could happen?"

395
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:29,097
Hey, little guy.

396
00:31:31,183 --> 00:31:33,227
You're not afraid of me, are you?

397
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:39,983
Perfect.

398
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,653
Thanks.

399
00:31:57,167 --> 00:31:58,252
Hey!

400
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,840
You think you've got problems?
You take a good look, pal.

401
00:32:04,174 --> 00:32:05,968
How bad could it be, right?

402
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:08,220
I don't think you...

403
00:32:09,888 --> 00:32:13,517
Okay, pal. Take it easy.
No, don't go out there.

404
00:32:13,725 --> 00:32:16,186
Look, I said stop, you fruitcake!

405
00:32:16,478 --> 00:32:18,063
No. Come close.

406
00:32:18,856 --> 00:32:21,108
That's further. Come closer.

407
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:23,485
I said, stop! No!

408
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:49,469
Come here.

409
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:15,537
All right, calm down.

410
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:18,749
You wanna be scared?

411
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,626
- Fine!
- No!

412
00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:32,763
Get back, everybody!

413
00:33:33,013 --> 00:33:35,724
Get back in your vehicle.
We'll tell you when you can go.

414
00:33:35,974 --> 00:33:39,061
- What do we do now?
- We're not going to get past these guys.

415
00:33:39,269 --> 00:33:40,521
But you could.

416
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,736
Sorry about the truck, pal. Come on.

417
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,114
A little help, here?
You wanna hit the button, sir?

418
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:52,741
It's stuck.

419
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:56,537
Sue, your clothes. Lose them.

420
00:33:57,371 --> 00:33:58,455
Right.

421
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:00,791
This is so wrong.

422
00:34:09,258 --> 00:34:11,802
- Wow, you've been working out.
- Shut up!

423
00:34:13,804 --> 00:34:14,847
All right.

424
00:34:18,976 --> 00:34:20,686
All right, freeze!

425
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:22,437
Now just...

426
00:34:23,105 --> 00:34:25,524
Just put the man in the seat down.

427
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,068
Do it!

428
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:34,616
Any more great ideas?

429
00:34:34,783 --> 00:34:37,202
Why don't you strip down
and have a 100 people stare at you?

430
00:34:37,369 --> 00:34:39,121
- Sue.
- What?

431
00:34:43,709 --> 00:34:45,335
I'm gonna need therapy.

432
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:49,381
Come on, let's get out of here.

433
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:53,302
Excuse me. Coming through.

434
00:34:57,973 --> 00:35:01,059
All right, now just back away from him.

435
00:35:03,187 --> 00:35:05,939
And I want you to put your hands
on your head...

436
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,699
954 approaching scene.

437
00:35:15,908 --> 00:35:17,826
I still can't believe you made me do that.

438
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,287
We got through, didn't we? Just find Ben.

439
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,463
Ben!

440
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:39,056
Mum.

441
00:36:25,352 --> 00:36:26,728
Stay here, okay?

442
00:36:26,895 --> 00:36:28,021
I'm coming.

443
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:29,648
Hold on.

444
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:13,901
Hang on!

445
00:37:20,407 --> 00:37:21,366
I got you.

446
00:38:00,739 --> 00:38:03,283
<i>Get down on the ground. </i>

447
00:38:04,576 --> 00:38:06,495
<i>Get down on the ground now!</i>

448
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:12,960
Ben.

449
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:28,243
I swear to you...

450
00:39:29,077 --> 00:39:31,371
I will do everything in my power...

451
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:33,916
until there is not a breath left in me.

452
00:39:35,709 --> 00:39:37,544
You're going to be Ben again.

453
00:39:47,971 --> 00:39:49,598
I told you I felt fine.

454
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:52,267
Where are your ears?

455
00:39:55,771 --> 00:39:58,524
There are some folks outside
that want to talk to you.

456
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:00,400
We're not going public with this.

457
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:02,277
We're scientists, not celebrities.

458
00:40:02,361 --> 00:40:03,779
It's too late, son.

459
00:40:04,279 --> 00:40:05,280
Look.

460
00:40:06,365 --> 00:40:08,158
<i>... when a New York Fire Department
ladder truck... </i>

461
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:09,326
See that?

462
00:40:09,493 --> 00:40:10,661
<i>... became part of the tragedy. </i>

463
00:40:10,786 --> 00:40:13,121
<i>But the rescue itself is not the story. </i>

464
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:15,624
<i>One of the four stretched
to an amazing length... </i>

465
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:18,961
That's what they're calling you.
"The Fantastic Four. "

466
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,463
- Cool.
- No, wait! Where are you going?

467
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,714
I'm gonna go talk to them.

468
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,842
No, we should think this through.

469
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:26,760
That's great. Brainstorm.

470
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,225
Get back here, right now. Johnny!

471
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,396
Settle down.

472
00:40:39,773 --> 00:40:41,400
Do you believe this?

473
00:40:42,317 --> 00:40:43,861
Which one of you is the leader?

474
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:45,571
That would be me.

475
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,197
No, seriously.

476
00:40:49,575 --> 00:40:51,160
Okay, son. You're on.

477
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:03,005
During our recent mission
to the Von Doom space station...

478
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:07,759
we were exposed to
as yet unidentified radioactive energy.

479
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,595
- What happened on the bridge?
- How can you stretch?

480
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,555
- Were you really on fire?
- Is it true you can fly?

481
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,599
Yeah, I'm working on it.
It's actually really difficult.

482
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:16,143
No, actually, we do not know
much more than you do at this point.

483
00:41:18,187 --> 00:41:20,230
Sir, Larry King just cancelled.

484
00:41:20,772 --> 00:41:22,983
Apparently, there's a bigger story.

485
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:29,573
<i>Actually, here they come now.
You had to see it to believe it, folks. </i>

486
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:32,242
<i>- The man...
... named The Fantastic Four... </i>

487
00:41:32,451 --> 00:41:35,245
<i>We'll be going directly to our lab
to diagnose our symptoms. </i>

488
00:41:35,496 --> 00:41:37,164
<i>Symptoms? Is this some kind of disease?</i>

489
00:41:37,372 --> 00:41:39,750
No. It's not a disease.

490
00:41:40,876 --> 00:41:43,712
If having special powers is a disease,
then, yeah, we got it bad.

491
00:41:43,837 --> 00:41:46,298
Excuse me,
that thing doesn't look so fantastic.

492
00:41:46,548 --> 00:41:48,717
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero.

493
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,220
What he means is,
every team needs a mascot.

494
00:41:52,554 --> 00:41:56,558
A new day is dawning.
The day of The Fantastic Four.

495
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,313
Look!

496
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:04,900
<i>We went up to space
to find a way to understand DNA... </i>

497
00:42:05,526 --> 00:42:07,361
<i>cure disease, save lives. </i>

498
00:42:07,569 --> 00:42:11,990
<i>Well, now it's our DNA, our disease,
our lives on the line. </i>

499
00:42:13,492 --> 00:42:15,661
<i>Thank you. No more questions. </i>

500
00:42:16,995 --> 00:42:19,164
This is how you turn things around?

501
00:42:19,873 --> 00:42:23,210
These freaks on the front page?
Your company's in the obituaries?

502
00:42:23,836 --> 00:42:25,254
I was planning to use the publicity.

503
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,465
The board's in agreement,
the bank's lost enough already.

504
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:31,260
- Wait a minute.
- It's too late, Victor.

505
00:42:31,426 --> 00:42:35,222
Do you know how much money
I've invested in this company?

506
00:42:35,472 --> 00:42:36,598
Victor, stop.

507
00:42:37,516 --> 00:42:40,143
This isn't a negotiation. It's a notification.

508
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:42,980
We're pulling out.

509
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,483
Is all that for you, Dr. Richards?

510
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:28,901
I'm afraid so.

511
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:35,282
Come on, Ben, smile.
They want to like you, Ben. Say hi.

512
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:41,330
Don't do drugs.

513
00:43:53,050 --> 00:43:55,761
Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.

514
00:43:56,053 --> 00:43:58,055
I've got the usual for you.

515
00:43:58,263 --> 00:43:59,890
Good to have you back, sir.

516
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,266
Thanks, Willie.

517
00:44:04,144 --> 00:44:05,395
We had a tough year.

518
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:07,523
Yeah, like nine straight.

519
00:44:21,453 --> 00:44:23,914
Either we're moving really fast
or not at all.

520
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,007
I'll take the stairs.

521
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:45,644
How come Ben can't turn it on and off
like we can?

522
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,437
That's what we're here to find out.

523
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:49,648
I mean, if it happened to him...

524
00:44:49,857 --> 00:44:53,110
What? You mean, like, we won't be able
to turn it off, either?

525
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:54,611
That would save time.

526
00:44:54,778 --> 00:44:57,656
You don't really wanna walk around on fire
for the rest of your life, do you?

527
00:44:57,865 --> 00:44:59,449
- Is that a trick question?
- Grow up.

528
00:44:59,658 --> 00:45:02,452
Come on.
Am I the only guy who thinks this is cool?

529
00:45:03,829 --> 00:45:06,957
We should stay here until we can define
the extent of our changes...

530
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:09,501
and figure out how to reverse them.

531
00:45:13,589 --> 00:45:17,217
But I have to warn you, it's gonna be
a little crowded in some areas.

532
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:25,517
So, what do you think?

533
00:45:26,852 --> 00:45:30,564
I don't know, Reed, I think you might be
bringing your work home with you.

534
00:45:31,231 --> 00:45:34,193
Come on. Let me show you guys
where you'll be staying.

535
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,612
Busy guy.

536
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,747
Mr. Von Doom, would you like to comment
on the recent failure of your IPO?

537
00:45:46,914 --> 00:45:48,749
What about the rumors of a takeover?

538
00:46:11,146 --> 00:46:12,731
God, I was so worried about you.

539
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:16,026
Victor. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to call.

540
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,986
Please.

541
00:46:18,654 --> 00:46:19,863
No apologies.

542
00:46:20,823 --> 00:46:23,909
I've arranged for your things to be moved
to one of my condos.

543
00:46:24,117 --> 00:46:25,786
You'll have round-the-clock care.

544
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:28,038
Thank you. That's very generous of you.

545
00:46:28,247 --> 00:46:30,916
But I think I should stay here
with my brother...

546
00:46:31,542 --> 00:46:33,502
until we get a handle on things.

547
00:46:33,627 --> 00:46:36,713
Susan, I think you should let my doctors
have a look at you.

548
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,633
Victor, what are you doing here?

549
00:46:41,593 --> 00:46:43,804
I'm starting to wonder the same thing.

550
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:47,683
How much do you know
about what happened to you?

551
00:46:47,891 --> 00:46:48,892
Not much.

552
00:46:49,101 --> 00:46:51,186
We need to run tests
to see the extent of the damage.

553
00:46:51,353 --> 00:46:54,815
Well, you let me know what I can do.
We're all in this together now.

554
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:05,742
Victor, wait.

555
00:47:07,244 --> 00:47:10,914
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
the mission didn't go as planned.

556
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:14,168
Didn't go as planned?
It was a catastrophe.

557
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,628
You ruined the lives of four people.

558
00:47:16,795 --> 00:47:19,464
With all due respect, we're both to blame.
I told you to abort.

559
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:20,799
Abort?

560
00:47:20,883 --> 00:47:23,969
I put my company, my name,
billions of dollars on the line.

561
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:26,763
I will not let you make me look like a fool.

562
00:47:27,014 --> 00:47:28,223
Victor, if we can understand...

563
00:47:28,390 --> 00:47:31,518
I don't wanna understand it!
This isn't one of your science projects!

564
00:47:31,685 --> 00:47:34,021
I just wanna fix it. Fast!

565
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,024
Is there a problem?

566
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:43,739
No.

567
00:47:45,073 --> 00:47:46,366
No problem, Ben.

568
00:47:47,075 --> 00:47:50,662
Just pay your damn electric bill
and get to work on finding a cure.

569
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:27,741
He's heating up from his core.

570
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,785
And his vitals are completely normal.

571
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:33,038
If we're going to identify
the source of the mutation...

572
00:48:33,163 --> 00:48:35,165
we need to isolate
your recombinant DNA...

573
00:48:35,457 --> 00:48:37,668
so we can activate positional genomes.

574
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:40,587
We have to do a physical
in order to see what got zapped.

575
00:48:40,838 --> 00:48:42,756
Why didn't you just say so?

576
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:45,884
His internal organs are completely solid.

577
00:48:49,054 --> 00:48:50,556
How bad is it?

578
00:48:51,056 --> 00:48:52,683
You know, I used to smoke.

579
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:56,812
It's not invisibility per se.

580
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:00,524
You should be able to bend light
around other objects, even people...

581
00:49:00,816 --> 00:49:03,485
if you could control
your emotional state better.

582
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:04,778
Excuse me?

583
00:49:04,945 --> 00:49:08,282
I'm saying, if you had a little more
self-control, you could locate the trigger.

584
00:49:08,532 --> 00:49:11,618
Can you remember your exact emotions
on the bridge?

585
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:12,995
Anger.

586
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:14,955
Rage.

587
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:16,832
Frustration.

588
00:49:16,957 --> 00:49:19,251
Okay. Is there any way
to duplicate that feeling?

589
00:49:19,459 --> 00:49:21,128
Some memory or...

590
00:49:22,379 --> 00:49:24,590
I'm sure I can come up with something.

591
00:49:24,756 --> 00:49:27,050
- You feel anything?
- Nope.

592
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:29,344
Okay.

593
00:49:35,684 --> 00:49:37,477
It's hotter than I anticipated.

594
00:49:37,603 --> 00:49:40,063
<i>- Okay, Johnny, back it down.
- I can go hotter!</i>

595
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:42,149
<i>Johnny, just back it down. </i>

596
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:54,244
- Johnny, back it down right now!
- Johnny!

597
00:50:00,292 --> 00:50:03,795
Buzz kill!
You guys are cramping my style.

598
00:50:04,087 --> 00:50:06,256
Johnny, you were at 4,000 Kelvin.

599
00:50:06,465 --> 00:50:08,634
Any hotter
and you're approaching supernova.

600
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,719
- Sweet!
- No, not sweet!

601
00:50:10,928 --> 00:50:12,638
That's the temperature of the sun.

602
00:50:12,804 --> 00:50:14,515
Not only could you kill yourself...

603
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:16,308
but you could set fire
to Earth's atmosphere...

604
00:50:16,475 --> 00:50:18,477
and destroy all human life as we know it.

605
00:50:18,602 --> 00:50:21,480
Got it. Supernova: Bad.

606
00:50:28,737 --> 00:50:30,322
How's that coming?

607
00:50:37,496 --> 00:50:39,832
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

608
00:50:39,957 --> 00:50:41,542
- You sure?
- Yeah.

609
00:50:41,708 --> 00:50:42,918
I...

610
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:47,339
You probably thought
that was some form of latent hostility.

611
00:50:47,631 --> 00:50:50,008
What in the world
would give me that idea?

612
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:57,641
I mean, you broke up with me, right?

613
00:50:58,392 --> 00:50:59,685
- Are you kidding?
- No.

614
00:50:59,893 --> 00:51:02,563
I distinctly remember,
you walked out my door, ergo...

615
00:51:02,813 --> 00:51:05,774
I was ready for the next step, you weren't.
Ergo, I walked.

616
00:51:06,024 --> 00:51:07,985
I think it was a little bit more
complicated than that.

617
00:51:08,193 --> 00:51:11,947
I just wanted to share an apartment.
What was so complicated about that?

618
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:15,325
- There were a lot of variables to consider.
- No, there weren't.

619
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:19,413
There was you and me.
There were no variables, no math.

620
00:51:19,621 --> 00:51:21,832
It was actually
the simplest thing in the world.

621
00:51:21,915 --> 00:51:23,750
But like always, Reed,
your head got in the way.

622
00:51:23,876 --> 00:51:25,878
- No, it didn't.
- Then what was it?

623
00:51:29,506 --> 00:51:31,508
Did you feel anything when I left?

624
00:51:33,844 --> 00:51:35,804
Do you feel anything right now?

625
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:39,725
Hey, guys.

626
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,188
I think we have a serious problem.

627
00:51:57,993 --> 00:51:59,578
So what's the prognosis?

628
00:52:00,037 --> 00:52:04,249
Your tissue, your organs, your entire
biophysical structure is changing.

629
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,877
Every system is still functioning somehow.

630
00:52:07,503 --> 00:52:09,046
And it's changing into?

631
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,714
I don't really know.

632
00:52:10,756 --> 00:52:13,759
Some kind of organic-metallic alloy...

633
00:52:14,384 --> 00:52:17,638
stronger than titanium or carbon steel,
harder than diamonds.

634
00:52:18,222 --> 00:52:20,599
Like the shields
Reed said would protect us.

635
00:52:26,104 --> 00:52:27,314
How long?

636
00:52:27,439 --> 00:52:31,026
At this rate, the infection could be
complete in two, maybe three weeks.

637
00:52:31,235 --> 00:52:32,653
What do you mean complete?

638
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:34,404
I wish I could tell you.

639
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,324
I can't pretend to know
what we're dealing with here.

640
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:40,702
I'll have to notify the CDC.

641
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:42,663
- What?
- Centre for Disease Control.

642
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:43,831
I know what it is.

643
00:52:43,956 --> 00:52:47,167
If this thing is contagious, we may have
a big problem on our hands.

644
00:52:47,417 --> 00:52:49,628
We're talking about an epidemic here.

645
00:52:50,462 --> 00:52:51,588
Look at me.

646
00:52:53,757 --> 00:52:54,925
I have a life.

647
00:52:55,676 --> 00:52:57,970
I'm the face of a billion-dollar company.

648
00:52:59,596 --> 00:53:02,140
We need to keep this confidential.

649
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:06,520
Victor, this disease is progressive,
degenerative. I have to notify someone...

650
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:08,814
That's terrible news.

651
00:53:16,864 --> 00:53:18,782
But I think I'll get a second opinion.

652
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:51,023
Our uniforms were exposed
to the storm, like us.

653
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,025
So they can transform like us.

654
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:56,904
Becoming invisible, changing size on
demand or remaining impervious to flame.

655
00:53:57,196 --> 00:53:59,281
You guys look like an '80s rock band.

656
00:53:59,490 --> 00:54:01,700
You know, Ben, this material stretches.

657
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:04,244
I'm sure I can figure out a way
to make it fit.

658
00:54:04,578 --> 00:54:06,330
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing that.

659
00:54:06,497 --> 00:54:09,583
I love these costumes. They're missing
something, though. Needs, like, spice.

660
00:54:09,917 --> 00:54:10,959
They're not costumes.

661
00:54:11,084 --> 00:54:13,337
You can't use your powers in public,
Johnny.

662
00:54:13,587 --> 00:54:16,715
- You guys are worse than NASA.
- You could burn somebody.

663
00:54:16,882 --> 00:54:18,926
Maybe it's missing a utility belt.

664
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:25,807
Here you go, there's your change.

665
00:54:27,643 --> 00:54:29,144
Can I help you, buddy?

666
00:54:29,812 --> 00:54:32,481
- Oh, my.
- It's Sue Storm, it's the Invisible Woman!

667
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:35,692
Sue Storm, it is you.
Listen, my kid loves you!

668
00:54:44,451 --> 00:54:46,620
I can't believe I'm doing this again.

669
00:54:55,504 --> 00:54:57,965
Reed, we really can't go outside anymore.

670
00:54:58,131 --> 00:55:00,342
<i>We are on the cover of every publication
from People... </i>

671
00:55:00,551 --> 00:55:04,263
All right, I'm here, let's make this quick.
I got a lot of places to go today.

672
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:07,182
Oh, wait. I don't go anywhere.

673
00:55:07,391 --> 00:55:10,811
Johnny, it's imperative that we stay inside
for the foreseeable future.

674
00:55:11,061 --> 00:55:14,189
I know, but when you said that last time,
my brain heard "a week. "

675
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,483
Johnny, it's too dangerous
for you to be in public.

676
00:55:16,692 --> 00:55:17,943
You've been saying that for years.

677
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,237
What worries me is
that our powers are evolving.

678
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,114
I know!

679
00:55:22,656 --> 00:55:25,242
I am so close to flying, guys, I can taste it.

680
00:55:25,450 --> 00:55:27,244
- You can't fly.
- Yet.

681
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:29,496
Johnny, can you put that napkin out?

682
00:55:29,705 --> 00:55:30,831
Jesus.

683
00:55:32,124 --> 00:55:35,043
So what's going on, Reed?
How're you going to cure us?

684
00:55:35,335 --> 00:55:38,088
I'm going to build a machine
to recreate the storm.

685
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:42,176
The cosmic rays will travel
from this generator to this chamber.

686
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:43,719
What, no pop-ups?

687
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:47,890
- If I can reverse the wave signal...
- It'll return us back to normal.

688
00:55:51,602 --> 00:55:53,437
Right. But what are the risks?

689
00:55:53,604 --> 00:55:57,316
Even a small miscalculation could increase
our symptoms exponentially...

690
00:55:57,733 --> 00:55:59,067
or perhaps even kill us.

691
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:01,737
Now, dying. That's bad, right?

692
00:56:02,362 --> 00:56:04,406
I say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys.

693
00:56:04,656 --> 00:56:06,950
So how long
till this contraption's up and running?

694
00:56:07,117 --> 00:56:08,994
- I don't know, it's hard to say.
- How long, Reed?

695
00:56:09,119 --> 00:56:10,913
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

696
00:56:11,038 --> 00:56:14,082
- You don't want this to get worse.
- Worse than that?

697
00:56:14,333 --> 00:56:18,754
Guys, look, we're gonna be stuck here
for a while, so let's just try and get along.

698
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:37,147
- You could knock!
- Sorry!

699
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:14,226
Johnny!

700
00:57:18,355 --> 00:57:21,942
<i>More bad news for Von Doom Industries
today as Ned Cecil announced... </i>

701
00:57:22,192 --> 00:57:24,361

<i>Von Doom Industries was never able

706
00:57:58,479 --> 00:57:59,480
Interesting.

707
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:27,090
Hello?

708
00:58:32,971 --> 00:58:34,097
Victor?

709
00:58:37,392 --> 00:58:39,311
What's with these lights, huh?

710
00:58:39,561 --> 00:58:42,564
About the IPO, no hard feelings, right?

711
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,942
Nothing personal.

712
00:58:49,488 --> 00:58:53,408
You know, you could always move back
to Latveria.

713
00:58:54,243 --> 00:58:55,494
Start fresh.

714
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:58,997
Maybe that's where you belong,
the old country.

715
00:59:14,471 --> 00:59:15,973
Nothing personal, Ned.

716
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:19,226

<i>That was fantastic!</i>

<i>But, Johnny, come on. That's old school. </i>

<i>Show us something new. </i>

733
01:01:12,923 --> 01:01:14,174
Something new.

734
01:01:15,175 --> 01:01:16,343
You got it.

Wait, no!

That's dangerous.

You were on fire!</i>

- He didn't.
- Oh, yes, he did.

744
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:16,069
- Flame Boy never listens.
- What did he do to his uniform?

745
01:02:18,197 --> 01:02:20,365
<i>Johnny, I've gotta ask you
about this outfit. </i>

746
01:02:20,574 --> 01:02:22,576
Yeah, it's sort of
Armani meets astronaut.

747
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:24,453
So what are your superhero names?

748
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:27,873
They call me The Human Torch.
Ladies call me Torch.

749
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,250
What about the rest of the team?

750
01:02:30,459 --> 01:02:32,211
<i>- That's the Invisible Girl.
- Girl?</i>

751
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:35,672
<i>What about your leader, Reed Richards?
I hear you call him Mr. Fantastic. </i>

752
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:37,299
- Could've been worse.
- I guess.

753
01:02:37,466 --> 01:02:41,553
<i>Is it true what they say about him that
he can expand any part of his anatomy?</i>

754
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:45,808
<i>Well, I've always found him
to be a little limp. </i>

755
01:02:47,476 --> 01:02:49,895
What is that?
What do you call that thing?

756

<i>That's it. The Thing. </i>

757
01:02:52,064 --> 01:02:54,358
<i>Yeah, you think this is bad,
you should have seen him before. </i>

758
01:02:54,566 --> 01:02:56,652
Okay. Now I'm gonna go kill him.

759
01:03:04,785 --> 01:03:05,953
There he is.

760
01:03:13,544 --> 01:03:15,295
- Johnny!
- Can we talk about this later, guys?

761
01:03:15,462 --> 01:03:17,631
- No. We can't talk about this later.
- We can do this at home.

762
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,133
- What are you thinking?
- Where's my ride?

763
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:33,438
You think that's funny, Pebbles?

764
01:03:33,564 --> 01:03:34,606
- Johnny!
- What?

765
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:36,900
You gave us names? You don't think.

766
01:03:37,109 --> 01:03:39,194
So now you're the face
of The Fantastic Four?

767
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:41,196
A face that's about to be broken!

768
01:03:41,446 --> 01:03:42,865
Look, this isn't permanent, Johnny.

769
01:03:43,031 --> 01:03:45,033
We need to be careful
until we're normal again.

770
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:47,953
What if I don't wanna be normal?
I didn't turn into a monster!

771
01:03:48,579 --> 01:03:49,663
Ben!

772
01:03:59,631 --> 01:04:00,924
Did you just...

773
01:04:01,842 --> 01:04:02,843
Johnny, stop it.

774
01:04:03,010 --> 01:04:04,845
- That's it, Tinkerbell!
- No, Ben.

775
01:04:05,095 --> 01:04:07,222
You wanna fly? Then fly!

776
01:04:13,312 --> 01:04:16,690
Wait a minute, guys! Ben, don't do this!

777
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:19,151
Let's see if we can get blood
from a stone.

778
01:04:19,234 --> 01:04:21,195
Let's see. Bring it, burnout!

779
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:23,030
You two need a time-out!

780
01:04:25,866 --> 01:04:27,409
Talk to blockhead, he started it.

781
01:04:27,576 --> 01:04:30,120
I don't care. Damn it, Johnny.

782
01:04:31,705 --> 01:04:32,873
Ben, wait!

783
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:34,958
What?

784
01:04:37,669 --> 01:04:40,923
You need to control yourself
and think before you act.

785
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:44,301
Yeah, but see, that's your problem.
You always think, you never act.

786
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:47,888
What if we got these powers for a reason?
What if it's like some higher calling?

787
01:04:48,180 --> 01:04:50,390
A higher calling?
Like getting girls and making money?

788
01:04:50,516 --> 01:04:52,017
Is there any higher?

789
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:54,478
You know what, Reed?
This is who we are.

790
01:04:55,187 --> 01:04:56,188
Accept it.

791
01:04:57,481 --> 01:04:59,733
Or better yet, enjoy it.

792
01:05:04,112 --> 01:05:07,825
Wait, Ben, slow down. He didn't mean it.

793
01:05:08,826 --> 01:05:10,786
You know Johnny.
He's always been a hothead.

794
01:05:10,953 --> 01:05:13,288
It ain't him. It's them!

795
01:05:14,957 --> 01:05:16,500
I can't live like this.

796
01:05:16,834 --> 01:05:19,127
Just give Reed a little more time.
You know how he works.

797
01:05:19,336 --> 01:05:21,630
Analyzing every little step
before he takes one.

798
01:05:21,797 --> 01:05:24,424
- It's easy for you to be patient.
- No, it's not!

799
01:05:25,425 --> 01:05:28,178
I thought I was done waiting for Reed,
but I...

800
01:05:31,431 --> 01:05:33,851
- We're all in this together, Ben.
- Together?

801
01:05:35,102 --> 01:05:38,397
Susie, look at me.
You got no idea what I'd...

802
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:43,277
What I'd give to be invisible.

803
01:05:59,293 --> 01:06:00,711
Thank you, gentlemen.

804
01:06:02,171 --> 01:06:04,339
I'm just gonna pick up a few things...

805
01:06:05,716 --> 01:06:07,176
for some friends.

806
01:06:24,776 --> 01:06:25,986
Perfect.

807
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:56,433
That's not funny.

808
01:06:57,434 --> 01:06:58,977
This is Ben Grimm here.

809
01:06:59,186 --> 01:07:01,855
The first mook from Brooklyn
to go into outer space.

810
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:03,732
So pay him some respect.

811
01:07:03,941 --> 01:07:05,943
Just give me the usual and I'm out.

812
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:07,152
All right.

813
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:10,322
- Make it a double.
- Make it a triple.

814
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:15,661
- Put it on my tab, Ernie.
- All right, Alicia.

815
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,037
Appreciate it.

816
01:07:17,621 --> 01:07:18,747
No problem.

817
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:25,462
It's okay, Ben.

818
01:07:25,587 --> 01:07:27,923
If there's a God, he hates me.

819
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:30,759
She is not so into hate.

820
01:07:32,886 --> 01:07:35,055
If you could see me,
you wouldn't be saying that.

821
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,640
Then let me see you.

822
01:07:37,891 --> 01:07:38,934
Can I?

823
01:07:44,273 --> 01:07:45,482
- Careful.
- It's okay.

824
01:08:08,714 --> 01:08:10,007
So sad.

825
01:08:13,886 --> 01:08:17,848
You know,
being different isn't always a bad thing.

826
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:22,895
Trust me. This ain't one of them times.

827
01:08:25,230 --> 01:08:27,149
Not if you don't want it to be.

828
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:31,236
- All right, Ernie, I'm out of here.
- I'll take you.

829
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:33,030
See you later, Benny.

830
01:08:40,370 --> 01:08:41,914
I'm Alicia, by the way.

831
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:48,378
Thanks, Ernie.

832
01:08:57,971 --> 01:09:00,390
Reed got what he wanted.

833
01:09:01,058 --> 01:09:02,768
And everything he wanted...

834
01:09:03,977 --> 01:09:05,312
he took from me.

835
01:09:10,734 --> 01:09:13,821
Now it's time to take it back.

836
01:09:17,074 --> 01:09:20,994
But first,
I need to get rid of his bodyguard.

837
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:37,803
This seat taken?

838
01:09:39,054 --> 01:09:40,681
What are you doing here?

839
01:09:42,099 --> 01:09:43,767
I was worried about you.

840
01:09:44,309 --> 01:09:46,728
You were worried about me?
That's sweet.

841
01:09:47,437 --> 01:09:49,690
Come on.
Let me buy you something to eat.

842
01:09:52,151 --> 01:09:54,319
Looks like you could use the company.

843
01:09:59,408 --> 01:10:00,409
Reed?

844
01:10:07,749 --> 01:10:10,294
- I was just resting my eyes.
- So I see.

845
01:10:11,837 --> 01:10:14,047
The new readouts look very promising.

846
01:10:14,548 --> 01:10:15,883
Not promising enough.

847
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:17,634
When are the next tests?

848
01:10:18,927 --> 01:10:20,512
I've run out of plans.

849
01:10:22,347 --> 01:10:24,057
So I was thinking maybe...

850
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:28,520
There's always me.

851
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:31,064
No. It's too soon.

852
01:10:31,857 --> 01:10:33,817
- Reed?
- I should get back to work.

853
01:10:34,151 --> 01:10:36,528
- You need a break.
- Sue, not now, please.

854
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:38,405
Come on. Let's go.

855
01:10:40,073 --> 01:10:41,658
Remember this place?

856
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:44,661
Of course. This is where
I first asked you out.

857
01:10:44,912 --> 01:10:47,789
I think that it was me
that asked you.

858
01:10:48,207 --> 01:10:49,333
Right.

859
01:10:52,044 --> 01:10:53,504
You can be a little intimidating.

860
01:10:53,587 --> 01:10:56,006
You know a girl can grow old
waiting for you to take charge.

861
01:10:56,173 --> 01:10:59,051
- We can't be as bold as...
- As who ? Victor ?

862
01:11:01,261 --> 01:11:03,597
You know, there is no me and Victor.

863
01:11:05,307 --> 01:11:05,933
Never was.

864
01:11:08,477 --> 01:11:11,063
Well, I guess that's what
I thought you always wanted.

865
01:11:14,191 --> 01:11:15,359
A stronger man.

866
01:11:21,114 --> 01:11:22,241
I did, Reed.

867
01:11:22,991 --> 01:11:24,284
But I wanted you to be that man.

868
01:11:25,244 --> 01:11:26,245
Why didn't you say so?

869
01:11:28,288 --> 01:11:30,499
I guess, it, kind of, would
have defeated the purpose.

870
01:11:32,292 --> 01:11:35,254
But I'm saying it now.
So take charge.

871
01:11:45,347 --> 01:11:46,181
That's not fair.

872
01:11:53,772 --> 01:11:54,815
Excuse me.

873
01:11:59,528 --> 01:12:01,071
I know it's not easy.

874
01:12:02,030 --> 01:12:04,616
Life hasn't changed that much for Reed,
Sue, or Johnny.

875
01:12:04,825 --> 01:12:07,452
At least they can still go out in public.
But for you...

876
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:10,205
If you're trying to cheer me up,
you're doing a hell of a job.

877
01:12:10,455 --> 01:12:11,832
You know what I mean, Scarface?

878
01:12:11,999 --> 01:12:14,710
I'm just saying I know what it's like
to lose something that you love...

879
01:12:14,877 --> 01:12:16,837
to see it slip away
and know it's never coming back.

880
01:12:16,962 --> 01:12:18,088
Look.

881
01:12:18,881 --> 01:12:21,049
Reed is gonna fix me up, okay?

882
01:12:22,885 --> 01:12:25,012
For your sake I hope you're right.

883
01:12:25,596 --> 01:12:27,097
Look, he's a brilliant man.

884
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:30,225
We should all trust
that he's working as hard as he can.

885
01:12:30,893 --> 01:12:32,102
You're his best friend.

886
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:35,230
So what possible reason could he have
for taking his time?

887
01:12:38,233 --> 01:12:41,153
I mean, other than spending
more time with Sue.

888
01:12:44,990 --> 01:12:48,076
- Wow, I had no idea.
- It's true.

889
01:12:52,080 --> 01:12:53,207
Yeah.

890
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,709
I have that effect on people.

891
01:12:57,336 --> 01:12:58,420
Ben.

892
01:13:00,547 --> 01:13:02,633
So you remember my name now, do you?

893
01:13:03,842 --> 01:13:07,137
Do you also remember
what you swore to do...

894
01:13:07,429 --> 01:13:09,181
with every breath in your body?

895
01:13:09,348 --> 01:13:11,266
We're working as hard as we can.

896
01:13:11,767 --> 01:13:13,769
Yeah. I can tell.

897
01:13:15,562 --> 01:13:17,564
- Victor was right.
- Victor?

898
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:21,610
Ben, I don't know if this thing
will change us back or make us worse.

899
01:13:21,860 --> 01:13:23,612
I need you to be patient
for a little while longer.

900
01:13:23,779 --> 01:13:24,780
Reed, look at me!

901
01:13:24,947 --> 01:13:27,491
I am looking.
That's why I can't make a mistake.

902
01:13:27,741 --> 01:13:30,244
I've gotta get it right and it's not right yet!
We need to test it!

903
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:33,413
I spent my whole life protecting you,
and for what?

904
01:13:33,622 --> 01:13:35,666
So you can play Twister
with your girlfriend...

905
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:37,793
while I'm the freak of the week?

906
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:40,128
Ben, stop it!

907
01:13:40,796 --> 01:13:43,507
- You stay out of this, Susie!
- Stop it, or I will.

908
01:13:44,842 --> 01:13:46,635
Get off me, rubber boy!

909
01:13:47,386 --> 01:13:48,929
You guys, quit it.

910
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:07,281
Calm down!

911
01:14:21,837 --> 01:14:24,882
Good thing you're flexible enough
to watch your own back.

912
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:35,017
'Cause I ain't doing it no more.

913
01:14:38,687 --> 01:14:40,272
You two are on your own.

914
01:14:52,326 --> 01:14:53,785
Look what the marketing guys gave me.

915
01:14:53,911 --> 01:14:56,038
Look, check it out, listen.
You're gonna love this.

916
01:14:56,205 --> 01:14:58,582
<i>It's clobbering time!</i>

917
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:00,250
It's catchy, right?

918
01:15:02,294 --> 01:15:03,629
Isn't that great?

919
01:15:06,632 --> 01:15:08,342
That was the prototype.

920
01:15:15,474 --> 01:15:18,435
- Johnny, have you seen Ben?
- Yeah, Sunshine just left.

921
01:15:18,644 --> 01:15:21,230
Look, Sue, I'm sorry.
I can't stand this freak show.

922
01:15:21,355 --> 01:15:24,566
- I gotta get back to the real world.
- You're calling that the real world?

923
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:27,736
Sue, stop. You're not Mum.
Don't talk to me like I'm a little boy, okay?

924
01:15:27,986 --> 01:15:30,113
Maybe I would
if you stopped acting like one.

925
01:15:30,322 --> 01:15:33,075
Do you even hear yourself?
Who do you think you are?

926
01:15:33,325 --> 01:15:36,078
Why is everyone on my ass?
If you guys are jealous, that's fine.

927
01:15:36,286 --> 01:15:37,830
I didn't expect it
to come from you, though.

928
01:15:37,955 --> 01:15:40,624
You really think those people out there
care about you?

929
01:15:40,833 --> 01:15:42,334
You're just a fad to them, Johnny!

930
01:15:42,501 --> 01:15:45,629
Let's try something new.
You live your life, I'll live mine.

931
01:15:47,798 --> 01:15:48,924
Sound good?

932
01:15:51,385 --> 01:15:53,846
And just for the record, they love me!

933
01:16:39,099 --> 01:16:40,767
Oh, God. Reed.

934
01:17:22,309 --> 01:17:24,311
Oh, my God, Reed. What did you do?

935
01:17:24,728 --> 01:17:26,563
- I can make it work.
- No!

936
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:30,275
I need more power to control the storm.

937
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:31,735
More power?

938
01:17:31,902 --> 01:17:34,196
<i>- You need a doctor. Come with me.
- Sue. </i>

939
01:17:35,239 --> 01:17:36,949
<i>- One more try...
- You need to rest. </i>

940
01:17:37,115 --> 01:17:40,577
Leonard, bring me our lab rat.

941
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,251
Ben. Come in.

942
01:17:48,919 --> 01:17:50,963
What is this? Where's Reed?

943
01:17:51,129 --> 01:17:53,549
Where do you think? With Sue.

944
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,718
I'll take it from here, Leonard.

945
01:17:58,011 --> 01:17:59,012
Yes, sir.

946
01:18:04,226 --> 01:18:05,686
What do you want, Vic?

947
01:18:05,978 --> 01:18:07,020
To help you.

948
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:10,774
The machine is ready.

949
01:18:11,316 --> 01:18:12,651
But Reed said it wouldn't...

950
01:18:12,776 --> 01:18:14,987
He also said we'd avoid
that storm in space...

951
01:18:15,154 --> 01:18:17,281
but we all know how that turned out.

952
01:18:17,823 --> 01:18:21,577
He couldn't generate enough power
for the machine to reach critical mass.

953
01:18:21,994 --> 01:18:25,164
Yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic.

954
01:18:25,956 --> 01:18:27,958
- And you can?
- Yes.

955
01:18:32,254 --> 01:18:33,255
Tell me...

956
01:18:35,132 --> 01:18:37,259
do you want to be Ben Grimm again?

957
01:20:22,573 --> 01:20:23,657
Thank you.

958
01:20:26,201 --> 01:20:27,327
Vic?

959
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:43,552
Vic, it worked.

960
01:20:51,143 --> 01:20:53,770
Everyone thought I was safe
behind those shields.

961
01:20:56,732 --> 01:20:57,983
Oh, my God.

962
01:20:59,359 --> 01:21:01,945
The machine worked for me.
It can work for you, too!

963
01:21:02,154 --> 01:21:05,157
It did, Ben. It worked perfectly.

964
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:10,370
- You planned this.
- I've always wanted power.

965
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:14,791
Now I have an unlimited supply.

966
01:21:15,459 --> 01:21:17,294
And no Thing to stand in your way.

967
01:21:17,503 --> 01:21:18,962
Take a good look, Ben.

968
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:22,883
This is what a man looks like
who embraces his destiny.

969
01:21:28,013 --> 01:21:30,140
One down, three to go.

970
01:21:31,225 --> 01:21:32,226
Vic?

971
01:21:33,602 --> 01:21:34,812
Right on cue.

972
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:36,730
Ben?

973
01:21:38,232 --> 01:21:40,234
- What did you do?
- Exactly what I said I would.

974
01:21:40,442 --> 01:21:43,487
I built a better, stronger being.

975
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,074
And outsmarted the great Reed Richards.

976
01:21:47,241 --> 01:21:50,452
If you've exposed yourself to the storm,
you're endangering your life.

977
01:21:50,744 --> 01:21:53,372
- You need help.
- You always know best.

978
01:21:55,582 --> 01:21:58,585
So tell me, what happens
when you superheat rubber?

979
01:22:21,441 --> 01:22:23,318
No!

980
01:22:33,287 --> 01:22:35,831
Mr. Von Doom, are you okay?

981
01:22:36,874 --> 01:22:38,125
Never better, Jimmy.

982
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:53,515
Why the long face? Let's talk in my office.

983
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:15,120
Ben.

984
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:19,041
Sue!

985
01:23:19,166 --> 01:23:21,043
Johnny, the machine worked!

986
01:23:21,710 --> 01:23:23,420
Give me a hand. Come on.

987
01:23:26,006 --> 01:23:27,216
Get his arm.

988
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:31,845
You all right, Ben? Put him on the step.

989
01:23:32,012 --> 01:23:35,015
What happened, big guy?
I leave you for five minutes...

990
01:23:36,225 --> 01:23:37,309
The machine.

991
01:23:37,851 --> 01:23:41,438
Vic used it on himself.
He was affected by the cloud like us.

992
01:23:41,730 --> 01:23:44,274
- Where's Reed?
- Vic must have taken him.

993
01:23:49,238 --> 01:23:52,241
Dr. Richards,
allow me to begin your lesson.

994
01:23:52,950 --> 01:23:54,701
Chemistry 101.

995
01:23:56,245 --> 01:23:59,623
What happens to rubber
when it's supercooled?

996
01:24:04,670 --> 01:24:05,963
Give up?

997
01:24:08,590 --> 01:24:10,259
That's not like you, Reed.

998
01:24:16,974 --> 01:24:19,726
After all, we're both doctors.

999
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:23,188
Painful?

1000
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:26,024
You don't know the meaning of the word.

1001
01:24:34,324 --> 01:24:37,119
Just a little something
from our defense contracts.

1002
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:44,751
Let's check in on the rest of the family,
shall we?

1003
01:24:51,717 --> 01:24:53,177
We gotta get out of here!

1004
01:24:56,346 --> 01:24:58,932
Wait a minute. I got an idea!

1005
01:24:59,433 --> 01:25:01,852
- Don't even think about it.
- Never do.

1006
01:25:02,019 --> 01:25:04,354
What are you doing? Johnny, no!

1007
01:25:10,527 --> 01:25:13,572
Come on, flame on!

1008
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:28,253
We have to help Reed.

1009
01:25:28,420 --> 01:25:31,298
It's too dangerous for you now.
You have to stay here.

1010
01:25:33,634 --> 01:25:35,093
What did I do?

1011
01:26:12,214 --> 01:26:13,632
Come on, think!

1012
01:26:36,155 --> 01:26:38,615
Two down, two to go.

1013
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:53,589
Sue.

1014
01:26:55,924 --> 01:26:58,594
- What has he done to you?
- How romantic.

1015
01:27:01,346 --> 01:27:02,556
Victor, please.

1016
01:27:04,057 --> 01:27:05,350
Call me Doom.

1017
01:27:06,518 --> 01:27:10,147
The machine works. It worked on Ben,
it can work on you. We can turn you back.

1018
01:27:10,397 --> 01:27:14,359
Do you really think fate turned us
into gods so we could refuse these gifts?

1019
01:27:14,568 --> 01:27:17,404
Victor, you always thought
you were a god. Now back off.

1020
01:27:17,654 --> 01:27:19,656
Susan, let's not fight.

1021
01:27:19,823 --> 01:27:21,033
No. Let's.

1022
01:27:26,205 --> 01:27:28,332
Susan, you're fired!

1023
01:27:39,218 --> 01:27:40,594
Marco.

1024
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:43,222
Polo.

1025
01:27:56,693 --> 01:27:59,154
Did you say goodbye
to your brother Johnny?

1026
01:28:03,492 --> 01:28:05,702
It's time to end this!

1027
01:28:08,038 --> 01:28:10,749
No, Vic. It's clobbering time.

1028
01:28:19,925 --> 01:28:22,010
Damn, I've been waiting to do that.

1029
01:28:22,928 --> 01:28:24,513
Susie, you okay?

1030
01:28:25,806 --> 01:28:27,558
Victor ain't that bad, huh?

1031
01:28:29,893 --> 01:28:32,312
"He's just a little larger than life," right?

1032
01:28:33,021 --> 01:28:35,440
Maybe next time
you'll listen to me before...

1033
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:37,276
Ben!

1034
01:29:28,035 --> 01:29:29,912
- Sorry, ladies.
- Stop the car!

1035
01:29:30,078 --> 01:29:33,248
Pull over. Hit the brakes!

1036
01:29:42,049 --> 01:29:43,509
<i>This is the police. </i>

1037
01:29:44,051 --> 01:29:47,721
<i>Put your hands up
and step down from the vehicle!</i>

1038
01:29:51,433 --> 01:29:52,559
Take him out!

1039
01:29:58,690 --> 01:30:01,109
Ladies, I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

1040
01:30:01,318 --> 01:30:04,238
- The transmission sticks.
- Not gonna be a problem.

1041
01:30:42,109 --> 01:30:44,027
I can't let you do that!

1042
01:30:45,237 --> 01:30:46,321
Reed?

1043
01:30:49,032 --> 01:30:50,617
I'll be right with you.

1044
01:30:57,791 --> 01:30:59,042
Hello, Susan.

1045
01:31:01,003 --> 01:31:03,005
You three are pathetic.

1046
01:31:11,597 --> 01:31:12,723
You missed me.

1047
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:17,561
Had a little relapse, huh?

1048
01:31:19,146 --> 01:31:21,482
- Welcome back.
- This is gonna be fun.

1049
01:31:43,962 --> 01:31:45,589
I can't hold it!

1050
01:31:58,060 --> 01:31:59,478
Johnny, supernova!

1051
01:31:59,645 --> 01:32:01,063
I thought we agreed that was bad.

1052
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:02,189
Now!

1053
01:32:04,233 --> 01:32:05,526
- Ben!
- Gotcha.

1054
01:32:14,284 --> 01:32:16,495
Sue! Think you can contain it?

1055
01:32:27,506 --> 01:32:28,757
Flame on, kid.

1056
01:32:55,534 --> 01:32:58,495
Is that the best you can do?

1057
01:32:59,454 --> 01:33:01,707
Time for your lesson. Chem 101.

1058
01:33:01,957 --> 01:33:04,418
What happens
when you rapidly cool hot metal?

1059
01:33:05,752 --> 01:33:06,879
Ben!

1060
01:33:57,971 --> 01:33:59,598
You done good, kid.

1061
01:34:01,350 --> 01:34:02,351
Come on.

1062
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:05,437
Sue, you okay?

1063
01:34:05,979 --> 01:34:07,064
Yeah.

1064
01:34:15,113 --> 01:34:16,573
Man, I love this job.

1065
01:34:18,408 --> 01:34:19,576
Job, huh?

1066
01:34:20,619 --> 01:34:22,496
Well, we do have the suits.

1067
01:34:44,393 --> 01:34:45,644
Ladies, your drinks.

1068
01:34:45,727 --> 01:34:47,980
- I don't think we need another.
- Just one more.

1069
01:34:48,147 --> 01:34:50,858
Thank you, thank you so much. Cheers!

1070
01:34:53,652 --> 01:34:56,488
I need names and shots.

1071
01:34:56,738 --> 01:34:57,865
Bartender!

1072
01:34:58,365 --> 01:35:00,826
They're custom-made, 36 EEEE.

1073
01:35:00,951 --> 01:35:03,745
Well, look. I've been crunching
the numbers on the machine.

1074
01:35:03,954 --> 01:35:05,706
And I think if I can rework
the power settings...

1075
01:35:05,873 --> 01:35:08,625
Forget about it, egghead. I'm good as is.

1076
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:10,335
Better than good, baby.

1077
01:35:12,087 --> 01:35:14,756
You just need to work on your touch.

1078
01:35:15,674 --> 01:35:17,384
I like the sound of that.

1079
01:35:20,262 --> 01:35:22,848
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

1080
01:35:27,227 --> 01:35:28,187
Thanks.

1081
01:35:34,193 --> 01:35:36,820
I found a broken gasket from space.

1082
01:35:38,155 --> 01:35:39,364
A gasket?

1083
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:42,868
- Reed, come on, we're at a party.
- And if one of us were to wear it...

1084
01:35:51,835 --> 01:35:53,128
No more thinking.

1085
01:35:53,754 --> 01:35:55,464
No more variables.

1086
01:36:00,594 --> 01:36:01,720
Sue Storm...

1087
01:36:02,888 --> 01:36:04,264
will you marry me?

1088
01:36:15,567 --> 01:36:19,488
Sue, you kind of need to say something.

1089
01:36:20,322 --> 01:36:21,406
Yes.

1090
01:36:31,667 --> 01:36:35,003
That's my nose, genius. These are my lips.

1091
01:36:41,135 --> 01:36:42,469
She's kissing him.

1092
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,555
That's so cute.

1093
01:36:46,014 --> 01:36:47,474
About time, you guys.

1094
01:36:48,851 --> 01:36:50,894
No more wisecracks about the way I look.

1095
01:36:53,397 --> 01:36:55,065
Call me Mr. Sensitivity.

1096
01:36:56,525 --> 01:37:00,028
Okay. Wide load coming through.
Everybody move, he's huge.

1097
01:37:01,446 --> 01:37:03,699
- Come here, Mr. Sensitive.
- Flame on.

1098
01:37:07,578 --> 01:37:08,662
Showoff!

1099
01:37:37,107 --> 01:37:38,567
How long will it be?

1100
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:40,402
Should be about 12 days.

1101
01:37:44,406 --> 01:37:47,409
Aw, come on.
WhatÂ´s wrong with this thing?

1102
01:37:52,831 --> 01:37:55,083
Ready.
