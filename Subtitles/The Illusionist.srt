Listen. "There is no argument

It's the butterflies

Oh, for Pete's sake.

Too obvious. How many men

We have eight men inside,
another eight out front.

I'm Chief Inspector Walter Uhl

Very impressive.

[Chuckles]
Yes, the orange tree.

You know, I have seen things

- Extraordinary.
- Thank you.

190
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,684
I have been puzzling
over how it works...

191
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:23,278
especially how the butterflies fly.

I assure you,
your secret is safe with me.

193

- Yes.

But nothing fancy.
Perhaps you'll give me a tip.

198

Yes, all right.

199
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,108
I'll show you one I'm very fond of.
Are you a gambling man?

- On occasion, yes.
- I will bet you the secret of the orange tree...

Excellent.

203
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:04,556

It's in your left.

208
00:21:18,376 --> 00:21:20,310
- Well-
- A lucky guess, perhaps.

209
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:22,573
You have a confederate
who signals you.

210

- No. It's more primitive than that.
- Uh-huh.

When you raise your hand to your head,
the blood drains from it.

00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:31,979
It will be paler every time.

213
00:21:36,027 --> 00:21:40,862
Oh. Oh, I like that very much.

214

Please take it with my compliments.

215

Why, thank you.
Eh, the blood drains.

00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:46,458
Yes.

311
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:51,063
So, I hear congratulations
are in order.

312

They say you'll be the princess.

- Ah.

315
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:03,578
It makes a certain sense, I suppose.

316

We've known each other for years,
and of course, our families.

He's very intelligent.

Wished what?

323
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:38,812
Wished that I would see you again.

324
00:32:43,592 --> 00:32:45,651
And now you have.

325
00:32:47,796 --> 00:32:51,391
Yes, now I have.

326
00:32:58,407 --> 00:33:01,205
I look forward to seeing you
again at the Hofburg.

327
00:33:01,276 --> 00:33:03,608

Join us for a drink?

Please.

340
00:34:33,368 --> 00:34:35,962
You like something to eat,
something to drink, hmm?

- No, thank you.
- Herr Eisenheim...

342
00:34:38,373 --> 00:34:42,104
I'm going to ask you a question...

343
00:34:42,177 --> 00:34:44,168
that may not seem friendly...

344
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:47,807
but I assure you, in fact, is.
[Clears Throat]

345

What is your relationship
with the Duchess von Teschen?

346
00:34:53,955 --> 00:34:56,685
You're right,
that doesn't seem friendly.

347

Oh, but that is precisely my point.

348
00:34:59,294 --> 00:35:02,991
For, you see,
where others might judge...

349
00:35:03,064 --> 00:35:07,865
a discreet carriage ride
for what it seemed to be...

350
00:35:07,936 --> 00:35:11,531
I am willing to find out
what it actually was.

351
00:35:13,275 --> 00:35:16,005
All right. We were
childhood acquaintances.

352
00:35:16,077 --> 00:35:18,477
Acquaintances?

353
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,845
Childhood friends.

354
00:35:20,916 --> 00:35:23,077
My father was a cabinetmaker.

355
00:35:23,151 --> 00:35:26,780
- <i>He made the furniture for her family's house.</i>
- [Chuckles]

357
00:35:30,258 --> 00:35:35,161
- Has there been a complaint?
- Oh, no, no. If there'd been a complaint...

358
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:38,722
well, we'd be having a very, uh,
different sort of conversation.

359
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:44,731
Yes. He relies on you for
that sort of thing, does he?

360
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:47,741
I'm a simple public servant,
Herr Eisenheim.

361
00:35:47,809 --> 00:35:49,868
That's not what I hear.

362
00:35:49,945 --> 00:35:53,608
I hear you'll be
the chief of police very soon.

363
00:35:53,682 --> 00:35:58,210
- Maybe mayor of Vienna? Party secretary?
- All subject to his whim.

364
00:35:58,286 --> 00:36:01,346
You better hope he doesn't dissolve
the parliament before you get there.

365
00:36:01,423 --> 00:36:05,883
Now the prince has some progressive ideas,
but he will make a fine emperor.

366
00:36:05,961 --> 00:36:09,727
Well, they say you're very close to him,
so I'm sure you'll do fine.

367
00:36:09,798 --> 00:36:15,600
Look. Yes, indeed, they say
that I'm very close to the prince.

368
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:20,801
But the simple truth of the matter is,
Herr Eisenheim, I'm the son of a butcher.

369
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:24,937
He's the heir to the empire.
How close could we be to such as him?

370
00:36:25,013 --> 00:36:28,779
<i>Hmm? Do you see my point?</i>

371
00:36:33,154 --> 00:36:36,385
Don't fool yourself that
you can play in their game.

372
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:40,194
I've served on the edge of it...

<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Bravo.</i>

390
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:19,558
A fair likeness of the old man.

391
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:22,994
- Too modern a style for him, of course.
- <i>[Laughter]</i>

392
00:38:23,064 --> 00:38:25,191
I'm afraid I'm not much
of a painter.

393
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:28,531
It's true. There are no brushstrokes
in this painting.

394
00:38:28,603 --> 00:38:32,004
I can see that clearly.

395
00:38:32,073 --> 00:38:34,007
So to achieve the color...

396
00:38:34,075 --> 00:38:37,909
some sort of chemical must
be interacting, presumably.

397
00:38:37,979 --> 00:38:40,880
<i>Some sort of sprayer up your sleeve?</i>

- If you feel you must.

399
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:49,584
- I do.
- Oh, let the man do his show.

400
00:38:49,657 --> 00:38:52,717
You want me to just sit there
when it's so obvious?

401
00:38:52,794 --> 00:38:55,126

I try to enlighten you.

Skill or destiny, or divine right?

We all know the story
of a sword called Excalibur.

Excalibur's blade

a long time ago. You don't know me at all.

Then why did you speak to me?
Why did you even bother talking-

467
00:45:30,725 --> 00:45:33,193
And you kept it all this time.

468
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:38,559
I used to sit and stare
at your picture...

trying to imagine where you were.

470

At night I'd have dreams
I had gone with you...

471
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:51,307
and then I'd wake up
and realize where I was.

472

But in my dreams you
had shorter hair and no beard.

Where did you go when you left?

475
00:46:16,671 --> 00:46:19,071
To my uncle's farm near Prague.

476
00:46:20,342 --> 00:46:22,333

then Asia Minor...

480
00:46:30,685 --> 00:46:33,279
and then the Orient for many years.

481
00:46:33,355 --> 00:46:35,687
So long.

482
00:46:35,757 --> 00:46:38,248
I always meant to return.

483
00:46:39,861 --> 00:46:44,798
I just- I kept thinking I'd find it
around the next corner.

484
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:47,891
What?

485
00:46:49,504 --> 00:46:51,438
A real mystery.

486
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:56,402
I saw remarkable things...

487
00:46:56,478 --> 00:46:59,811
but the only mystery
I never solved was...

488
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:02,941

with him next week
to announce our engagement.

492
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:35,112
He wants the Hungarians behind him.

493

They're going to crown him king.

494

I'm sure his father will have
something to say about that.

495

He plans to overthrow his father.

496
00:47:43,858 --> 00:47:47,089
That could go very badly for him...

497
00:47:47,162 --> 00:47:49,096

I am part of his plan.

aligning himself with my family.

- Leave him.
- It's not that easy.

he'll hunt us.

506

- Yes, we have some.

Not that we observed, no.

no jurisdiction here.

919
01:34:18,583 --> 01:34:23,020
<i>That's right. You may do as you wish here,</i>
<i>without consequence.</i>

920
01:34:24,222 --> 01:34:27,953
Nobody can punish you.

921
01:34:28,025 --> 01:34:30,118
- Except one man.
- Who's that?

922
01:34:30,194 --> 01:34:33,061
The emperor.

923
01:34:33,130 --> 01:34:36,099
I don't suppose he'll leave his crown
to a murderer, do you?

924
01:34:39,237 --> 01:34:42,570
- He'll never believe you.
- Maybe not.

925
01:34:43,875 --> 01:34:46,673
Hmm.

926
01:34:46,744 --> 01:34:48,871
But, I wrote a letter
to his general staff...

927
01:34:48,946 --> 01:34:52,313
<i>telling them... everything.</i>

928
01:34:52,383 --> 01:34:55,648
<i>Including your plan</i>
<i>to overthrow the emperor.</i>

929
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:58,917
I know they'll listen to that.

930
01:34:58,990 --> 01:35:01,584
<i>You'll not take the throne-</i>
<i>not with my help.</i>

931
01:35:01,659 --> 01:35:06,153
You no longer want to be chief of police?
Mayor of Vienna?

932
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:09,859
<i>You don't want to be</i>
<i>a baron, an aristocrat?</i>

933
01:35:11,168 --> 01:35:13,932
I'm afraid that's out of
the question at this point.

934
01:35:19,377 --> 01:35:21,311
You fool.
He's tricking you.

935
01:35:21,379 --> 01:35:24,871
He's manipulating you. He had the sword
at a command performance.

936
01:35:24,949 --> 01:35:27,440
He could have pried the stones loose then
and planted them here.

937
01:35:27,518 --> 01:35:29,452
- He has planted everything.
- You're drunk.

938
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:34,184
It's all a trick.
It's an illusion.

939
01:35:35,660 --> 01:35:38,925
Perhaps there's truth
in this illusion.

940
01:35:52,009 --> 01:35:54,307
You need to wire your driver,
and have the sword returned.

941
01:35:54,378 --> 01:35:58,212
- Or what?
- I'll shoot you. Perhaps I'll shoot you anyway.

942
01:35:58,282 --> 01:36:01,774
And then you'll have killed
a police inspector and a duchess.

943
01:36:01,852 --> 01:36:03,786
Or perhaps you'll kill yourself.

944
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:07,517
You, uh, committed suicide,
distraught at having failed your leader.

945
01:36:10,695 --> 01:36:14,324
<i>[Horses Galloping]</i>

946
01:36:23,641 --> 01:36:29,136
<i>Ah. Some officers</i>
<i>of the general staff, I'd guess.</i>

947
01:36:29,213 --> 01:36:31,204
They must have received my letter.

948
01:36:40,491 --> 01:36:44,257
- What do you want?
- I don't want anything.

949
01:36:44,328 --> 01:36:49,061
Fine. Fine. You shall have nothing.

950
01:36:57,241 --> 01:37:01,143
- Gentlemen-
- The situation is so obvious.

951
01:37:01,212 --> 01:37:04,181
Everyone's completely incompetent.

952
01:37:04,248 --> 01:37:06,682
My father runs the empire
into the ground...

953
01:37:06,751 --> 01:37:08,810
and no one notices, no one
knows anything about it.

954
01:37:08,886 --> 01:37:11,218
I propose to clean up
the mess, and you betray me!

955
01:37:11,288 --> 01:37:13,916
You're all becoming irrelevant.
You will be replaced.

956
01:37:13,991 --> 01:37:18,325
[Sighs Deeply]
The country will be run by mongrels!

957
01:37:18,396 --> 01:37:22,355
There's a thousand different voices screaming
to be heard, and nothing will be done!

958
01:37:22,433 --> 01:37:26,392
Nothing!
I've done everything I can.

959
01:37:26,470 --> 01:37:29,439
Too much!
[Gasping]

960
01:37:31,642 --> 01:37:33,633
- Far too much.
- <i>[Knocking]</i>

01:38:59,563 --> 01:39:01,963
I used to be.

01:39:26,557 --> 01:39:29,924
You!
Who gave you this?

978
01:39:32,163 --> 01:39:34,893
- <i>Who gave you this?</i>
- Herr Eisenheim!

you'll travel ahead

- And she understands everything this entails?
- <i>Completely.</i>

<i>[Willigut] Do you think that</i>
