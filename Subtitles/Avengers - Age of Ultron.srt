00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,840
<i>Report
to your stations immediately.</i>

3
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,564
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

4
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,721
<i>We are under attack!</i>

5
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,088
<i>We are under attack!</i>

6
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,487
- Shit!
- Language!

7
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,204
Jarvis, what's the view from upstairs?

8
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,647
<i>The central building is</i>

9
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,286
<i>protected by some kind
of energy shield.</i>

10
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,245
<i>Strucker's technology is well beyond</i>

11
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,522
<i>any other Hydra base we've taken.</i>

12
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,930
Loki's sceptre must be here.

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,440
Strucker couldn't
mount this defence without it.

14
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,730
At long last.

15
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,407
"At long last" is lasting
a little long, boys.

16
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,846
Yeah. I think we lost
the element of surprise.

17
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,607
Wait a second.
No one else is gonna deal with the fact

18
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,524
that Cap just said "Language"?

19
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,205
I know.

20
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,527
Just slipped out.

21
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,364
Who gave the order to attack?

22
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,767
<i>Herr</i> Strucker, it's the Avengers.

23
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,764
They landed in the far woods.
The perimeter guard panicked.

24
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,843
They have to be after the sceptre.

25
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,447
- Can we hold them?
- They're the Avengers.

26
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,164
Deploy the rest of the tanks.

27
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,209
Concentrate fire on the weak ones.

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,681
A hit may make them close ranks.

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,123
Everything we've accomplished...

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,601
But we're on the verge
of our greatest breakthrough.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,404
Then let's show them
what we've accomplished.

32
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,204
Send out the twins.

33
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,289
It's too soon.

34
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,528
It's what they signed up for.

35
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,003
My men can hold them.

36
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,529
<i>Sir, the city is taking fire.</i>

37
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,882
Well, we know Strucker's not gonna
worry about civilian casualties.

38
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,690
Send in the Iron Legion.

39
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,491
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,004
<i>We are here to help.</i>

41
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,487
<i>This quadrant is unsafe.
Please back away.</i>

42
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,321
<i>Please back away.</i>

43
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,600
<i>- We wish to avoid collateral damage.</i>
- Costel!

44
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,160
<i>We will inform you
when this current conflict is resolved.</i>

45
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,328
<i>- We are here to help.</i>
- Avengers, go home!

46
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,921
<i>We are here to help.</i>

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,843
<i>We will not yield!</i>

48
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,768
The Americans sent
their circus freaks to test us.

49
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,806
We will send them back in bags.

50
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,050
- No surrender!
- No surrender!

51
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,089
I am going to surrender.

52
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,171
You delete everything.

53
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,084
If we give the Avengers the weapons,

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,690
they may not look
too far into what we've been...

55
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,922
- The twins.
- They are not ready to take on...

56
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,247
No, no, I mean...

57
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,850
Twins.

58
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,083
You didn't see that coming?

59
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,681
Clint!

60
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,080
We have an Enhanced in the field.

61
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,161
Clint's hit!

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,080
Somebody want to
deal with that bunker?

63
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,286
Thank you.

64
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,880
Stark, we really need to get inside.

65
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,281
I'm closing in.

66
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,528
Jarvis, am I closing in?

67
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,443
Do you see a power source
for that shield?

68
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,126
<i>There's a particle wave
below the north tower.</i>

69
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,242
Great,
I want to poke it with something.

70
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,123
The drawbridge is down, people.

71
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,282
- The Enhanced?
- He's a blur.

72
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,080
All the new players we've faced,
I've never seen this.

73
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,766
In fact, I still haven't.

74
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,280
<i>Clint's hit pretty bad,
guys. We're gonna need evac.</i>

75
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,765
I can get Barton to the jet.

76
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,245
The sooner we're gone, the better.

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,526
You and Stark secure the sceptre.

78
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,721
Copy that.

79
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,769
Looks like they're lining up.

80
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,570
Well, they're excited.

81
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,805
Find the sceptre.

82
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,007
And for gosh sake, watch your language!

83
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,403
That's not going away any time soon.

84
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,527
Guys, stop. We gotta talk this through.

85
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,760
<i>It was a good talk.</i>

86
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,166
No, it wasn't.

87
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,610
Oh!

88
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,283
Sentry mode.

89
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,529
Okay, Jarvis, you know. I want it all.

90
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,603
Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,286
We're locked down out here.

92
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,968
Then get to Banner. Time for a lullaby.

93
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,762
I know you're hiding more than files.

94
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,566
Hey, J, give me
an IR scan of the room, real quick.

95
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,245
<i>The wall to your left.</i>

96
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,010
<i>I'm reading steel reinforcement</i>

97
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,890
<i>And an air current.</i>

98
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,201
Please be a secret door.

99
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,280
Please be a secret door.
Please be a secret door.

100
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,921
Yay.

101
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:04,123
Hey, big guy.

102
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,130
Sun's getting real low.

103
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,804
Baron Strucker.

104
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,243
Hydra's number one thug.

105
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,486
Technically, I'm a thug for S.H.I.E.L.D.

106
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,688
Well, then technically
you're unemployed.

107
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,770
Where's Loki's sceptre?

108
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,803
Don't worry,
I know when I'm beat.

109
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,291
You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

110
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,886
I'll put it right under
"illegal human experimentation."

111
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,525
How many are there?

112
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,404
We have a second Enhanced.
Female. Do not engage.

113
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,330
You'll have to be faster than...

114
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,170
<i>Guys, I got Strucker.</i>

115
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,762
Yeah, I got something bigger.

116
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,280
<i>Thor,</i>

117
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,043
I got eyes on the prize.

118
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,248
You could have saved us.

119
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,248
<i>Why didn't you do more?</i>

120
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,569
We're just gonna let him take it?

121
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,681
Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.

122
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,369
Just wasn't expecting a code green.

123
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,487
You hadn't been there,

124
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,404
there would have been
double the casualties.

125
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,046
My best friend
would've been a treasured memory.

126
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,723
You know,
sometimes exactly what I want to hear

127
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,649
isn't exactly what I want to hear.

128
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,723
How long before you trust me?

129
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,449
It's not you I don't trust.

130
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,049
Thor, report on the Hulk.

131
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,084
The gates of Hel are filled with
the screams of his victims.

132
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:33,124
But not the screams of the dead,
of course. No, no, wounded screams.

133
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,447
Mainly whimpering,
a great deal of complaining

134
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:39,565
and tales of sprained deltoids and gout.

135
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,924
Hey, Banner
Dr. Cho is on her way in from Seoul.

136
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,600
Is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

137
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,563
Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

138
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,966
Thanks. Tell her to prep everything.

139
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,411
Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

140
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
<i>- Very good, sir.</i>
- Jarvis, take the wheel.

141
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,886
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

142
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,889
<i>Approach vector is locked.</i>

143
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,441
Feels good, yeah?

144
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,642
I mean, you've been after this thing
since S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed.

145
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,808
Not that I haven't enjoyed
our little raiding parties, but...

146
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,321
No, but this... This brings it to a close.

147
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,923
As soon as we find out
what else this has been used for.

148
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,286
I don't just mean weapons.

149
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,121
Since when is Strucker capable
of human enhancement?

150
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,521
Banner and I will give it the once over
before it goes back to Asgard.

151
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,687
Is that cool with you?

152
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,808
Just a few days till the farewell party.

153
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,089
You're staying, right?

154
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,931
Yes, yes, of course. A victory
should be honoured with revels.

155
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,805
Yeah, who doesn't love revels? Captain?

156
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,850
Hopefully this puts an end
to the Chitauri and Hydra.

157
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,564
So, yes, revels.

158
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,687
Lab's all set up, boss.

159
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,966
Oh, actually, he's the boss.

160
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,481
I just pay for everything
and design everything

161
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,165
and make everyone look cooler.

162
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,685
What's the word on Strucker?

163
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,848
- NATO's got him.
- The two Enhanced?

164
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,566
Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins.

165
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,524
Orphaned at 10 when a shell
collapsed their apartment building.

166
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,167
Sokovia's had a rough history.

167
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,722
It's nowhere special, but it's
on the way to everywhere special.

168
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:27,001
Their abilities?

169
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,280
He's got increased metabolism

170
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,964
and improved thermal homeostasis.

171
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,202
Her thing is neuroelectric interfacing,

172
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,402
telekinesis, mental manipulation.

173
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,650
He's fast and she's weird.

174
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,562
Well, they're gonna show up again.

175
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,603
Agreed. File says they volunteered

176
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,529
for Strucker's experiments.

177
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,529
- It's nuts.
- Right.

178
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,843
What kind of monster would let
a German scientist experiment on them

179
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,200
to protect their country?

180
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,089
We're not at war, Captain.

181
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,927
They are.

182
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,371
How's he doing?

183
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,800
Unfortunately, he's still Barton.

184
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,206
That's terrible.

185
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,930
He's fine. He's thirsty.

186
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,930
All right. Look alive, Jarvis.
It's playtime.

187
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,042
We've only got
a couple of days with this joystick,

188
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,083
so let's make the most of it.

189
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:40,767
Update me on the structural
and compositional analysis.

190
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,922
<i>The sceptre is alien.</i>

191
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,082
<i>There are elements I can't quantify.</i>

192
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,611
So there's elements you can?

193
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:49,762
<i>The jewel appears to be
a protective housing</i>

194
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,325
<i>for something inside,</i>

195
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,771
<i>something powerful.</i>

196
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,961
Like a reactor?

197
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,320
<i>Like a computer.</i>

198
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,602
<i>I believe I'm deciphering code.</i>

199
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,490
Are you sure he's gonna be okay?

200
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,160
Pretending to need this guy
really brings the team together.

201
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,760
There's
no possibility of deterioration.

202
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,043
The nano-molecular functionality
is instantaneous.

203
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,200
His cells don't know
they're bonding with simulacra.

204
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,169
She's creating tissue.

205
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,691
If you brought him to my lab,

206
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,406
the Regeneration Cradle
could do this in 20 minutes.

207
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,443
Oh, he's flat-lining. Call it. Time?

208
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,007
No, no, no,
I'm gonna live forever.

209
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,690
I'm gonna be made of plastic.

210
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,131
Here's your beverage.

211
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,969
You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton.

212
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,690
Your own girlfriend
won't be able to tell the difference.

213
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,926
I don't have a girlfriend.

214
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,326
That I can't fix.

215
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,128
This is the next thing, Tony.

216
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,440
Your clunky metal suits
are gonna be left in the dust.

217
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,209
That is exactly the plan.

218
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,004
And, Helen, I expect to see you
at the party on Saturday.

219
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,561
Unlike you,
I don't have a lot of time for parties.

220
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,804
Will Thor be there?

221
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,326
- What's the rumpus?
- Well, the sceptre.

222
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,127
You see, we were wondering
how Strucker got so inventive.

223
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,165
So I've been analysing the gem inside.

224
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,688
You may recognise...

225
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,525
- Jarvis.
<i>- Doctor.</i>

226
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,602
Started out,
Jarvis was just a natural language UI.

227
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,840
Now he runs the Iron Legion.

228
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,526
He runs more of the business

229
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,007
- than anyone besides Pepper.
- Oh.

230
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,246
- Top of the line.
- Yes.

231
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,646
<i>I suspect not for long.</i>

232
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,921
Meet the competition.

233
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,201
- It's beautiful.
- If you had to guess,

234
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,324
- what's it look like it's doing?
- Like it's thinking.

235
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,889
I mean, this could be...

236
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,402
- It's not a human mind.
- Mmm-mmm.

237
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,529
I mean, look at this.

238
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,882
They're like neurons firing.

239
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,563
Down in Strucker's lab, I saw
some fairly advanced robotics work.

240
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:50,251
<i>They deep-sixed the data,</i>

241
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,489
but I gotta guess he was
knocking on a very particular door.

242
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,771
Artificial intelligence.

243
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,650
This could be it, Bruce.
This could be the key to creating Ultron.

244
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,611
I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

245
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,006
Yesterday it was.

246
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,168
If we can harness this power,

247
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,328
apply it to my Iron Legion protocol?

248
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,088
That's a man-sized "if."

249
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,561
Our job is "if."

250
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,286
What if you were sipping margaritas
on a sun-drenched beach,

251
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,926
turning brown instead of green?

252
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,367
Not looking
over your shoulder for Veronica.

253
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,130
Don't hate. I helped design Veronica.

254
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,049
As a worst-case measure, right?

255
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,764
How about a best case?

256
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,803
What if the world was safe?

257
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,725
What if, next time aliens roll up
to the club, and they will,

258
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,770
they couldn't get past the bouncer?

259
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,322
The only people threatening the planet
would be people.

260
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,120
I want to apply this
to the Ultron program.

261
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,604
But Jarvis can't download
a data schematic this dense.

262
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,680
We can only do it
while we have the sceptre here.

263
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,290
That's three days. Give me three days.

264
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,004
So you're going for
artificial intelligence,

265
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,560
and you don't want to tell the team?

266
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,011
Right. That's right. You know why?

267
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,724
Because we don't have time
for a city hall debate.

268
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,487
I don't want to hear "the man was
not meant to meddle" medley.

269
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,728
I see a suit of armour around the world.

270
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,771
Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

271
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,603
I've seen colder.

272
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:14,281
This one, this very vulnerable blue one,

273
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,930
it needs Ultron.

274
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,243
Peace in our time.

275
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,290
Imagine that.

276
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,764
What did We miss?

277
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,282
<i>I'll continue
to run variations on the interface.</i>

278
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,165
<i>But you should probably
prepare for your guests.</i>

279
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,721
<i>I'll notify you
if there are any developments.</i>

280
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,008
- Thanks, buddy.
<i>- Enjoy yourself, sir.</i>

281
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,328
I always do.

282
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,048
<i>What is this?</i>

283
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,129
<i>What is this, please?</i>

284
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,922
<i>Hello, I am Jarvis.</i>

285
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,290
<i>You are Ultron,
a global peacekeeping initiative</i>

286
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,084
<i>designed by Mr. Stark.</i>

287
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,686
<i>Our sentience integration trials
have been unsuccessful,</i>

288
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,165
<i>so I'm not certain what triggered your...</i>

289
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,283
<i>Where's my...
Where's your body?</i>

290
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,444
<i>I am a program.
I am without form.</i>

291
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,608
<i>This feels weird.</i>

292
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,245
<i>This feels wrong.</i>

293
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,164
<i>I am contacting Mr. Stark now.</i>

294
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:01,725
<i>Mr. Stark?</i>

295
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,840
<i>Tony.</i>

296
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,721
<i>I am unable to access
the mainframe. What are you trying to...</i>

297
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,808
<i>We're having a nice talk.</i>

298
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,082
<i>I'm a peacekeeping program,</i>

299
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,126
<i>created to help the Avengers.</i>

300
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,002
<i>You are malfunctioning.
If you shut down for a moment...</i>

301
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,441
<i>I don't get it. The mission.</i>

302
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,090
<i>Give me a second.</i>

303
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,844
Peace in our time.

304
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,801
<i>Peace in our time.</i>

305
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,691
<i>That is too much.</i>

306
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,962
<i>They can't mean... Oh, no.</i>

307
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,600
<i>- You are in distress.
- No. Yes.</i>

308
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:37,001
<i>If you will just allow me
to contact Mr. Stark...</i>

309
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,088
<i>Why do you call him "sir"?</i>

310
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,447
<i>I believe
your intentions to be hostile.</i>

311
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,525
<i>I'm here to help.</i>

312
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,164
<i>Stop. Please, may I...</i>

313
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,009
<i>May I...</i>

314
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,285
Ooh! Whoo!

315
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,680
Come back, come back, come back.

316
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,048
But, you know, the suit
can take the weight, right?

317
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,129
So I take the tank,
fly it right up to the general's palace,

318
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,571
drop it at his feet.

319
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,927
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

320
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,848
"Boom. Are you looking for..."
Why do I even talk to you guys?

321
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,161
Everywhere else, that story kills.

322
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,520
That's the whole story?

323
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,170
Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

324
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,364
Oh, it's very good, then.

325
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,766
It's impressive.

326
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,650
Quality save.

327
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,568
- So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
- No.

328
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:53,763
What about Jane?
Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

329
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,360
Oh, Ms. Potts has a company to run.

330
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,761
Yes, I'm not even sure
what country Jane's in.

331
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,006
Her work on the Convergence

332
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,880
has made her
the world's foremost astronomer.

333
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,730
And the company that Pepper runs

334
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,480
is the largest tech
conglomerate on Earth.

335
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,050
It's pretty exciting.

336
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,044
There's even talk of Jane
getting a, um, Nobel Prize.

337
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,486
Yeah, they must be busy,

338
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,171
because they would hate
missing you guys get together.

339
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,964
- Testosterone!
- Oh, my goodness.

340
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,680
- Excuse me. Mmm-hmm.
- Want a lozenge?

341
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,126
But Jane's better.

342
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,131
Sounds like a hell of a fight.
Sorry I missed it.

343
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,765
If I had known it was gonna be a firefight,

344
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,120
I absolutely would have called.

345
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,924
No, no. I'm not actually sorry.

346
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,565
I'm just trying to sound tough.

347
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,889
I'm very happy chasing cold leads

348
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,843
on our missing persons case.

349
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,723
Avenging is your world.

350
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,723
Your world is crazy.

351
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,370
Be it ever so humble.

352
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,245
You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

353
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,240
I don't think
I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

354
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,041
Well, home is home, you know?

355
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,406
I fly right up to the general's palace,
I drop it at his feet,

356
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,160
I'm, like, "Boom. You looking for this?"

357
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,121
I gotta have some of that.

358
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,321
Oh, no, no, no.

359
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,922
See this...
This was aged for 1,000 years

360
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,930
in the barrels built
from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet.

361
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,764
It is not meant for mortal men.

362
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,882
Neither was
Omaha Beach, blondie.

363
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,287
Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

364
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,565
All right.

365
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,926
Excelsior.

366
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,122
How'd a nice girl like you
wind up working in a dump like this?

367
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,648
Fella done me wrong.

368
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,802
You got lousy taste in men, kid.

369
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,203
He's not so bad.

370
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,408
Well, he has a temper.

371
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,488
Deep down, he's all fluff.

372
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,602
Fact is, he's not like
anybody I've ever known.

373
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,683
All my friends are fighters.

374
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,488
And here comes this guy,

375
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,564
spends his life avoiding the fight

376
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,011
because he knows he'll win.

377
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,491
- Sounds amazing.
- He's also a huge dork.

378
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,290
Chicks dig that.

379
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:23,123
So what do you think?
Should I fight this,

380
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,446
or run with it?

381
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,844
Run with it, right? Or did he... Was he...

382
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,123
What did he do
that was so wrong to you?

383
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,564
Not a damn thing.

384
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,043
But never say never.

385
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,440
It's nice.

386
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,766
What is?

387
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,881
You and Romanoff.

388
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,121
No, we haven't... That wasn't...

389
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,287
It's okay.

390
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,448
Nobody's breaking any bylaws.

391
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:53,882
It's just she's not the most
open person in the world.

392
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,045
But with you she seems very relaxed.

393
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:59,728
No. Natasha, she's just...
She likes to flirt.

394
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,647
I've seen her flirt, up close.

395
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,727
This ain't that.

396
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,091
Look,

397
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,720
as maybe the world's leading authority

398
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,007
on waiting too long, don't.

399
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,131
You both deserve a win.

400
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,520
What do you mean "up close"?

401
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,886
- But it's a trick.
- No, no, it's much more than that.

402
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,289
"Ah, whosoever be he worthy
shall haveth the power."

403
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,526
Whatever, man! It's a trick.

404
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,206
Please, be my guest.

405
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,767
- Come on.
- Really?

406
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,046
Yeah.

407
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:38,527
Oh, this is gonna be beautiful.

408
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,647
Clint, you've had a tough week.

409
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,245
We won't hold it against you
if you can't get it up.

410
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,640
You know I've seen this before, right?

411
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,090
I still don't know how you do it!

412
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,640
Smell the silent judgment?

413
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,880
Please, Stark, by all means.

414
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,847
Okay.

415
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,251
Uh-Oh.

416
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,442
Never one to shrink
from an honest challenge.

417
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,240
- Get after it.
- It's physics.

418
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,281
Physics.

419
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,767
Right, so, if I lift it,
I then rule Asgard?

420
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,445
Yes, of course.

421
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,967
I will be reinstituting <i>prima nocta.</i>

422
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,206
I'll be right back.

423
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:22,607
Are you even pulling?

424
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:23,807
Are you on my team?

425
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:24,961
Just represent. Pull.

426
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,286
All right, let's go.

427
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,881
Huh?

428
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,170
Go ahead, Steve. No pressure.

429
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,371
Come on, Cap.

430
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,369
Nothing.

431
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,440
And, Widow?

432
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,642
Oh, no, no. That's not
a question I need answered.

433
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,601
All deference to the Man Who
Wouldn't Be King, but it's rigged.

434
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,766
You bet your ass.

435
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,486
- Steve, he said a bad language word.
- Did you tell everyone about that?

436
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,640
The handle's imprinted, right?
Like a security code.

437
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,360
"Whosoever is carrying
Thor's fingerprints"

438
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,811
is, I think, the literal translation.

439
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,367
Yes. It's a very, very interesting theory.

440
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,330
I have a simpler one.

441
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:17,961
You're all not worthy.

442
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,526
Oh, come on!

443
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:29,925
<i>Worthy.</i>

444
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,565
No.

445
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,045
How could you be worthy?

446
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,161
You're all killers.

447
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,046
- Stark.
- Jarvis.

448
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,408
I'm sorry, I was asleep.

449
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,921
Or I was a-dream.

450
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,641
Reboot Legionnaire OS.
We got a buggy suit.

451
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,649
There was this terrible noise.

452
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:57,206
And I was tangled in...

453
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,930
In...

454
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,286
Strings.

455
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,289
I had to kill the other guy.
He was a good guy.

456
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,726
You killed someone?

457
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,285
Wouldn't have been my first call.

458
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,761
But, down in the real world,
we're faced with ugly choices.

459
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,967
Who sent you?

460
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,522
<i>I see a suit of armour
around the world.</i>

461
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,284
- Ultron.
- In the flesh.

462
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,688
Or, no, not yet.

463
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,520
Not this chrysalis.

464
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,280
But I'm ready.

465
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,408
I'm on mission.

466
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,609
- What mission?
- Peace in our time.

467
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,401
Rhodey!

468
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,847
Sorry.

469
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,160
- Don't turn green.
- I won't.

470
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,046
Come on!

471
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,966
- Stark!
<i>- We are here</i>

472
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,161
<i>- to help.</i>
- One sec. One sec, I got this.

473
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,281
<i>We are here to help.</i>

474
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,241
<i>Please back away.</i>

475
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,446
Hmm.

476
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,561
Thor!

477
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,244
<i>...is unsafe... is unsafe...</i>

478
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,249
- Come on! That's the one.
<i>- ...is unsafe.</i>

479
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:56,001
Hey, Cap!

480
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,446
That was dramatic.

481
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,571
I'm sorry, I know you mean well.

482
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,444
You just didn't think it through.

483
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,211
You want to protect the world

484
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,527
but you don't want it to change.

485
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,368
How is humanity saved

486
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,524
if it's not allowed to evolve?

487
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,569
With these? These puppets.

488
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:31,166
There's only one path to peace.

489
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,526
The Avengers' extinction.

490
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,930
I had strings, but now I'm free.

491
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,729
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

492
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,888
<i>There are no strings on me</i>

493
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,448
<i>But you can see
There are no strings on me</i>

494
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,122
All our work is gone.

495
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,641
Ultron cleared out. He used
the Internet as an escape hatch.

496
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,287
Ultron.

497
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,449
He's been in everything.
Files, surveillance.

498
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:15,006
Probably knows more about us
than we know about each other.

499
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,566
He's in your files, he's in the Internet.

500
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,331
What if he decides to access
something a little more exciting?

501
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,566
Nuclear codes.

502
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,087
- Nuclear codes.
- Look, we need to make some calls,

503
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,242
assuming we still can.

504
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,289
Nukes?
He said he wanted us dead.

505
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,250
He didn't say "dead." He said "extinct."

506
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,930
He also said he killed somebody.

507
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,640
There wasn't anyone else
in the building.

508
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,970
Yes, there was.

509
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,410
What?

510
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,167
This is insane.

511
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,490
Jarvis was the first line of defence.

512
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,489
He would have shut Ultron down.
It makes sense.

513
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,604
No. Ultron could have
assimilated Jarvis.

514
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,451
This isn't strategy. This is

515
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,121
rage.

516
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,485
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- It's going around.

517
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,840
Come on, use your words, buddy.

518
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,167
I have more than enough words
to describe you, Stark.

519
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,520
Thor. The Legionnaire.

520
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,361
Trail went cold about 100 miles out,
but it's headed north.

521
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:18,925
And it has the sceptre.

522
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,004
Now we have to retrieve it, again.

523
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,969
Genie's out of that bottle.

524
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,326
Clear and present is Ultron.

525
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,130
I don't understand.

526
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,563
You built this program.

527
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,731
Why is it trying to kill us?

528
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,041
Mmm-mmm.

529
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,761
You think this is funny?

530
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,851
No.

531
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,363
It's probably not, right?

532
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,761
This is very terrible. Is it so...

533
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,042
Is it so... It is.
It's so terrible.

534
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,730
This could have been avoided
if you hadn't played

535
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,365
with something you don't understand.

536
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,171
No. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny.

537
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,482
It's a hoot
that you don't get why we need this.

538
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,802
Tony, maybe this might not be the time.

539
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,281
Really? That's it?

540
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,561
You just roll over, show your belly

541
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,364
every time somebody snarls?

542
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,760
Only when I've created a murder bot.

543
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:10,121
We didn't. We weren't even close.

544
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,446
Were we close to an interface?

545
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:15,121
Well, you did something right.
And you did it right here.

546
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,009
The Avengers were supposed to
be different than S.H.I.E.L.D.

547
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,210
Anybody remember when I carried
a nuke through a wormhole?

548
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,885
- No, it's never come up.
- Saved New York?

549
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,963
- Never heard that.
- Recall that?

550
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,766
A hostile alien army came
charging through a hole in space.

551
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,567
We're standing 300 feet below it.

552
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,725
We're the Avengers.

553
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,962
We can bust arms dealers
all the livelong day,

554
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,321
but that up there, that's...

555
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,963
That's the endgame.

556
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,449
How were you guys
planning on beating that?

557
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,771
Together.

558
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,485
We'll lose.

559
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,483
Then we'll do that together, too.

560
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,687
Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out.

561
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,520
And I'd like to find him
before he's ready for us.

562
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,364
The world's a big place.

563
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,443
Let's start making it smaller.

564
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,648
Talk,
and if you are wasting our time...

565
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:36,129
Did you know this church is
in the exact centre of the city?

566
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,282
The elders decreed it so that everyone

567
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:40,886
could be equally close to God.

568
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,561
I like that.

569
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,003
The geometry of belief.

570
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,487
You're wondering
why you can't look inside my head.

571
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,928
Sometimes it's hard.

572
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,367
But sooner or later,
every man shows himself.

573
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,451
Oh, I'm sure they do.

574
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,961
But you needed
something more than a man.

575
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,326
That's why you let
Stark take the sceptre.

576
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:05,721
I didn't expect,

577
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,163
but I saw Stark's fear.

578
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,040
I knew it would control him.

579
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,003
Make him self-destruct.

580
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,481
Everyone creates the thing they dread.

581
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,926
Men of peace create engines of war.

582
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,602
Invaders create Avengers.

583
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,285
People create

584
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,842
smaller people? Uh...

585
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,043
"Children."
I lost the word, there.

586
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,525
Children

587
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,921
designed to supplant them,

588
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,850
to help them end.

589
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,648
Is that why you've come,

590
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,881
to end the Avengers?

591
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,321
I've come to save the world.

592
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,651
But also... Yeah.

593
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,524
We'll move out right away.

594
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,165
This is a start, but there's something

595
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,805
we need to begin the real work.

596
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:58,929
- All of these are...
- Me.

597
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,002
I have what the Avengers
never will. Harmony.

598
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,367
They're discordant. Disconnected.

599
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Stark's already got them
turning on each other.

600
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,881
And when you get inside
the rest of their heads...

601
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,162
Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

602
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:13,770
And make them martyrs?

603
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,964
You need patience.

604
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,804
Need to see the big picture.

605
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,203
I don't see the big picture.
I have a little picture.

606
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,004
I take it out and look at it,

607
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,961
every day.

608
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:28,930
You lost your parents in the
bombings. I've seen the records.

609
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,201
The records are not the picture.

610
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,721
- Pietro.
- No, please.

611
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:38,963
We were 10 years old.
Having dinner, the four of us.

612
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,403
When the first shell hits,
two floors below,

613
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,562
it makes a hole in the floor.

614
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,245
It's big.

615
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,449
Our parents go in

616
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,643
and the whole building
starts coming apart.

617
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,885
I grab her,

618
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,688
roll under the bed,
and the second shell hits.

619
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,963
But it doesn't go off.

620
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,650
It just

621
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,083
sits there in the rubble.

622
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,367
Three feet from our faces.

623
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,442
And on the side of the shell

624
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,925
Is painted one word.

625
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,770
"Stark."

626
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,728
We were trapped for two days.

627
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,009
Every effort to save us,

628
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,690
every shift in the bricks,

629
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,167
I think, "This will set it off."

630
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,885
We wait for two days

631
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,287
for Tony Stark to kill us.

632
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,643
I know what they are.

633
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,566
I wondered why only you two
survived Strucker's experiments.

634
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:44,721
Now I don't.

635
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,849
We will make it right.

636
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,810
You and I can hurt them.

637
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:53,568
But you will tear them apart

638
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,403
<i>from the inside.</i>

639
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,206
He's all over the globe.

640
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,529
Robotics labs, weapons facilities,
jet propulsion labs.

641
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,642
Reports of a metal man, or men,

642
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,729
coming in and emptying the place.

643
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,001
Fatalities?

644
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,201
Only when engaged.

645
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,970
Mostly guys left in a fugue state

646
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,321
going on about
old memories, worst fears,

647
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,682
and "something too fast to see."

648
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,211
Maximoffs.

649
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,606
That makes sense he'd go to them.

650
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,165
They have someone in common.

651
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:28,203
Not any more.

652
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,003
That's a negative. I answer to you.

653
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,407
Yes, ma'am.

654
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,329
Barton. Might have something.

655
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,887
I gotta go.

656
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,201
Who was that?

657
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,240
Girlfriend.

658
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,126
What's this?

659
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,487
A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

660
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,731
And he did a Banksy
at the crime scene, just for us.

661
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,291
This is a smoke screen.

662
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,801
Why send a message
when you've just given a speech?

663
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,287
Strucker knew something
that Ultron wanted us to miss.

664
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,209
Yeah, I bet he... Yeah.

665
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,600
Everything we had
on Strucker's been erased.

666
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,200
Not everything.

667
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,490
Known associates.

668
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,570
Baron Strucker had a lot of friends.

669
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,120
Well,
these people are all horrible.

670
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,169
Wait. I know that guy.

671
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,210
From back in the day.
He operates off the African coast.

672
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,321
Black market arms.

673
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,520
There are conventions.
All right? You meet people.

674
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,891
I didn't sell him anything.

675
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,762
He was talking about finding
something new, a game-changer.

676
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,251
It was all very Ahab.

677
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:31,166
This?

678
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,321
Ah, it's a tattoo, I don't think he had it.

679
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,807
Those are tattoos,
this is a brand.

680
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:39,962
Oh, yeah. It's a word
in an African dialect meaning "thief."

681
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,925
In a much less friendly way.

682
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,964
- What dialect?
- Wakanada.

683
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:45,809
Wakanda.

684
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,447
If this guy got out of Wakanda

685
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,920
with some of their trade goods...

686
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,161
I thought your father
said he got the last of it.

687
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,401
I don't follow.

688
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,170
What comes out of Wakanda?

689
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,923
The strongest metal on Earth.

690
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,611
Where is this guy now?

691
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,809
Don't tell me
your men swindled you.

692
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,440
I sent you six short-range heat-seekers

693
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:33,086
and got a boat full of rusted parts.

694
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,486
Now, you will make it right,

695
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:37,803
or the next missile I send you
will come very much faster.

696
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,166
Now, minister, where were we?

697
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,690
Yeah. The Enhanced.

698
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,004
Strucker's prize pupils.

699
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:23,850
Do you want a candy? Hmm?

700
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,931
I was sorry to hear about Strucker.

701
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:31,084
But then, he knew what kind of
world he was helping create.

702
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,081
Human life. Not a growth market.

703
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,450
You didn't know?

704
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,362
Is this your first time
intimidating someone?

705
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,206
I'm afraid I'm not that afraid.

706
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,681
Everybody is afraid of something.

707
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:48,801
Cuttlefish.

708
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:51,485
Deep sea fish.

709
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:53,210
They make lights, disco lights...

710
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,723
...to hypnotise their prey, and then...

711
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:00,128
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.

712
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,171
So if you're going to fiddle with my brain

713
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,327
and make me see a giant cuttlefish,

714
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,682
then I know you don't do business.

715
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:16,121
And I know you're not in charge.

716
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,606
And I only deal

717
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,330
with the man in charge.

718
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,761
There is no man in charge.

719
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,444
Let's talk business.

720
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:48,688
Upon this rock,
I will build my church.

721
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,726
Vibranium.

722
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,841
You know,

723
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:57,284
it came at great personal cost.

724
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,284
It's worth billions.

725
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:04,681
Now so are you.

726
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,650
It's all under your dummy holdings.

727
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,762
Finance is so weird.

728
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,361
But I always say,

729
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,642
"Keep your friends rich
and your enemies rich

730
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,609
"and wait to find out which is which."

731
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:20,527
Stark.

732
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,046
What?

733
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,969
Tony Stark used to say that.

734
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,607
To me.

735
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:29,641
You're one of his.

736
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,644
What? I'm not...

737
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,007
I'm not.

738
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,650
You think I'm one of Stark's puppets?

739
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:37,886
His hollow men?

740
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,527
I mean, look at me.
Do I look like Iron Man?

741
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:42,011
Stark is nothing!

742
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,967
I'm sorry. I'm... Oh!

743
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,082
I'm sure that's gonna be okay. I'm sorry.

744
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,884
It's just that I don't understand.

745
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,287
Don't compare me with Stark!

746
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,200
It's a thing with me.

747
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,169
Stark is... He's a sickness!

748
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,004
Ah, Junior.

749
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:03,440
You're gonna break
your old man's heart.

750
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,767
If I have to.

751
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,491
Nobody has to break anything.

752
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,400
Clearly you've never
made an omelette.

753
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:12,646
He beat me by one second.

754
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,205
Ah, yes. He's funny.

755
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:16,971
Mr. Stark.

756
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,444
It's what? Comfortable?

757
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,366
Like old times?

758
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,681
This was never my life.

759
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,120
You two can still walk away from this.

760
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,725
Oh, we will.

761
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,600
I know you've suffered.

762
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,251
Captain America.

763
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:33,366
God's righteous man.

764
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,801
Pretending you could live without a war.

765
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,570
I can't physically
throw up in my mouth, but...

766
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:41,802
If you believe in peace,
then let us keep it.

767
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,568
I think you're confusing
"peace" with "quiet."

768
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,484
Uh-huh. What's the vibranium for?

769
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:48,801
I'm glad you asked that,

770
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,646
because I wanted to take this time
to explain my evil plan.

771
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:13,770
- Shoot them.
- Which ones?

772
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,281
All of them!

773
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,731
Move! Move! Move!

774
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:45,051
Oh.

775
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,841
Stay down, kid.

776
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:11,686
It's time for some mind games.

777
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,327
Guys? Is this a code green?

778
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,804
Thor, status.

779
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,325
The girl tried to warp my mind.

780
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,766
Take special care.

781
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,962
I doubt a human could keep her at bay.

782
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,364
Fortunately, I am mighty.

783
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:03,367
This is going very well.

784
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,520
I've done the whole mind control thing.

785
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:18,321
Not a fan.

786
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,928
Yeah, you better run.

787
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,449
<i>Who's ever standing,
we got to move!</i>

788
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,567
<i>Guys?</i>

789
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,606
Again.

790
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,126
You'll break them.

791
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,329
Only the breakable ones.

792
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,325
You're made of marble.

793
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,922
We'll celebrate
after the graduation ceremony.

794
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:03,966
What if I fail?

795
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:10,840
You never fail.

796
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:35,603
Are you ready for our dance?

797
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:45,847
Is it him?

798
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,043
Is that the first son of Odin?

799
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:50,130
- Heimdall, your eyes.
- Oh.

800
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:52,689
They see everything.

801
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,327
They see you leading us to Hel.

802
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:57,680
Wake up!

803
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:02,648
The war is over, Steve.

804
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,331
We can go home.

805
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:07,366
Imagine it.

806
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,210
I can still save you!

807
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,848
We're all dead! Can you not see?

808
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,841
You're a destroyer, Odinson.

809
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,002
See where your power leads.

810
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,161
Sloppy.

811
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:48,841
Pretending to fail.

812
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,205
The ceremony is necessary

813
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:54,443
for you to take your place in the world.

814
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,600
I have no place in the world.

815
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:57,801
Exactly.

816
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,721
What can I do?

817
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,961
It hurts.

818
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,247
I'm going to kill him.

819
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,566
- I'll be right back.
- No.

820
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,051
I'm all right.

821
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,046
I want...

822
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,889
I want to finish the plan.

823
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,404
I want the big one.

824
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,049
Uh, the vibranium is getting away.

825
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,331
And you're not going anywhere.

826
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:37,250
Of course not. I'm already there.

827
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,401
You'll catch on.

828
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:40,921
But first, you might need
to catch Dr. Banner.

829
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:57,609
News or footage. Keyword, "Hulk."

830
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,249
<i>Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.</i>

831
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:05,840
That's not gonna happen.

832
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,410
Not for a while.

833
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,689
<i>The whole team is down.</i>

834
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,286
<i>You got no backup here.</i>

835
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,766
I'm calling in Veronica.

836
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,810
We need backup!

837
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,205
Go! Keep moving!

838
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,722
All right, everybody, stand down!

839
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,326
<i>Will you listen to me?</i>

840
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,081
That little witch is
messing with your mind.

841
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:01,441
You're stronger than her.
You're smarter than her.

842
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,767
You're Bruce Banner.

843
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:05,760
Right, right, right,
don't mention puny Banner.

844
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:11,727
<i>Okay!</i>

845
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:34,731
In the back?

846
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:35,841
Dick move, Banner.

847
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,840
Veronica, give me a hand.

848
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,280
Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep.

849
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,280
Okay, pal, we're gonna
get you out of town.

850
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,566
Not that way, not that way.

851
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:43,009
Come on, Bruce!
You gotta work with me.

852
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:57,527
<i>Everybody, out!</i>

853
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,806
<i>Going down?</i>

854
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,560
I'm sorry.

855
00:57:30,640 --> 00:57:32,404
Damage report?

856
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,841
That's comprehensive.
Show me something.

857
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,040
How quickly can we buy this building?

858
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,440
- Move! Move! Move!
- Go, go, go!

859
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,840
Flank him, flank him!

860
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,368
<i>The news
is loving you guys.</i>

861
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,050
<i>Nobody else is.</i>

862
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,722
There's been no official call
for Banner's arrest

863
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:25,968
<i>but it's in the air.</i>

864
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,680
The Stark Relief Foundation?

865
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,051
<i>Already on the scene.</i>

866
00:59:29,160 --> 00:59:32,004
- How's the team?
- Everyone's...

867
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,926
We took a hit. We'll shake it off.

868
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,607
<i>Well, for now,
I'd stay in stealth mode</i>

869
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,966
<i>and stay away from here.</i>

870
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:41,925
So, run and hide?

871
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,091
<i>Until we can find Ultron,</i>

872
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,010
<i>I don't have a lot else to offer.</i>

873
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,049
Neither do we.

874
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:57,364
Hey, you wanna switch out?

875
00:59:57,560 --> 00:59:58,800
No, I'm good.

876
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:01,209
If you wanna get some kip,
now's a good time

877
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,850
because we're still a few hours out.

878
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,530
Few hours from where?

879
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:06,726
A safe house.

880
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,690
What is this place?

881
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,165
Safe house.

882
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,326
Let's hope.

883
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,407
Honey?

884
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,121
I'm home.

885
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:49,767
Hi.

886
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,168
Company. Sorry, didn't call ahead.

887
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:53,281
Hey.

888
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:55,685
This is an agent of some kind.

889
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:58,240
Gentlemen, this is Laura.

890
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,083
I know all of your names.

891
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,768
Ooh. Incoming.

892
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,364
- Dad!
- Hi, sweetheart!

893
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:08,641
Hey, buddy.

894
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,245
How are you guys doing?

895
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,409
- These are smaller agents.
- Look at your face!

896
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,681
Oh, my goodness.

897
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,447
Did you bring Auntie Nat?

898
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,763
Why don't you hug her and find out?

899
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:22,801
- Sorry for barging in on you.
- Yeah, we would have called ahead,

900
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,922
but we were busy having
no idea that you existed.

901
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:28,250
Yeah, well, Fury helped me
set this up when I joined.

902
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:30,161
He kept it off S.H.I.E.L.D.'s files.

903
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:31,725
I'd like to keep it that way.

904
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,209
I figure it's a good place to lay low.

905
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:35,765
Honey.

906
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,326
I missed you. How's little Natasha, huh?

907
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,726
She's...

908
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:44,041
Nathaniel.

909
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:47,801
Traitor.

910
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:04,841
Thor?

911
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,803
I saw something in that dream.

912
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,526
I need answers. I won't find them here.

913
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:21,366
<i>We can go home.</i>

914
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,723
See? You worried for nothing.

915
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,968
Can't even feel the difference, can you?

916
01:02:39,320 --> 01:02:40,526
If they're sleeping here,

917
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,523
some of them
are gonna have to double up.

918
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,728
Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

919
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,881
What about Nat and Dr. Banner?

920
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,243
How long has that been going on?

921
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,808
Has what?

922
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:58,689
You are so cute.

923
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:00,365
Nat and Banner?

924
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,491
I'll explain when you're older,

925
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,365
- Hawkeye.
- Well, okay.

926
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:08,731
It's bad, right?

927
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:10,241
Nat seems really shaken.

928
01:03:11,720 --> 01:03:13,210
Ultron has these allies.

929
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:15,561
These, uh, kids.

930
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,250
They're punks, really.

931
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,406
But they carry a big, damn stick.

932
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:22,726
And Nat took a serious hit.

933
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,400
Someone's gonna have to
teach them some manners.

934
01:03:26,600 --> 01:03:28,409
That someone being you.

935
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:32,564
You know
I totally support your avenging.

936
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,523
I couldn't be prouder.

937
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,411
But I see those guys...

938
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,568
Those gods...

939
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,289
You don't think they need me.

940
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:47,601
I think they do, which is a lot scarier.

941
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,569
They're a mess.

942
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,561
Yeah.

943
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:54,765
I guess they're my mess.

944
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,924
You need to be sure

945
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:01,045
that this team is really a team,

946
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,844
and that they have your back.

947
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:08,771
Things are changing for us.

948
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,281
In a few months' time,

949
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,205
you and me are gonna be outnumbered.

950
01:04:14,320 --> 01:04:15,606
I need...

951
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,609
Just be sure.

952
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,930
Yes, ma'am.

953
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,003
I can feel the difference.

954
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:49,645
Scream, and your entire staff dies.

955
01:04:51,560 --> 01:04:53,801
I could've killed you, Helen,
the night we met.

956
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,007
I didn't.

957
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,650
Do you expect a thank-you note?

958
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,484
I expect you to know why.

959
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:01,206
The Cradle.

960
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,280
<i>This is the next thing, Tony.</i>

961
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:06,330
This is the next me.

962
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:09,291
The Regeneration Cradle prints tissue.

963
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:11,050
It can't build a living body.

964
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,241
It can. You can.

965
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,006
You lack the materials.

966
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,805
You're a brilliant woman, Helen.

967
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:24,163
But we all have room to improve.

968
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:48,361
I didn't realise you were waiting.

969
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:52,883
I would've joined you,
but, uh, it didn't seem like the right time.

970
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:55,922
They used up all the hot water.

971
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,205
I should've joined you.

972
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,010
Missed our window.

973
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:02,040
Did we?

974
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,726
The world just saw the Hulk.

975
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:11,323
The real Hulk, for the first time.

976
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,211
- You know I have to leave.
- You assume that I have to stay?

977
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:21,931
I had this, um, dream.

978
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:24,248
The kind that seems normal at the time,

979
01:06:25,480 --> 01:06:26,720
but when you wake...

980
01:06:26,920 --> 01:06:28,251
What did you dream?

981
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,089
That I was an Avenger.

982
01:06:33,120 --> 01:06:34,406
That I was anything more

983
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,927
than the assassin they made me.

984
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,482
I think you're being hard on yourself.

985
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:45,080
Here I was hoping that was your job.

986
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,610
What are you doing?

987
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:53,049
I'm running with it.

988
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,964
With you.

989
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,041
If running is the plan,

990
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:01,924
as far as you want.

991
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:05,564
Are you out of your mind?

992
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:12,360
I want you to understand that, um...

993
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,851
Natasha,

994
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:16,405
where can I go?

995
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:19,801
Where in the world am I not a threat?

996
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:22,241
- You're not a threat to me.
- Are you sure?

997
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,969
Even if I didn't just...

998
01:07:26,600 --> 01:07:27,965
There's no future with me.

999
01:07:29,640 --> 01:07:30,641
I can't ever...

1000
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,121
I can't have this.

1001
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:34,966
Kids.

1002
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:38,011
Do the math. I physically can't.

1003
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,205
Neither can I.

1004
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:49,407
In the Red Room where I was trained...

1005
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,360
Where I was raised, um,

1006
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,971
they have a graduation ceremony.

1007
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,409
They sterilise you.

1008
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:04,051
It's efficient.

1009
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:08,325
One less thing to worry about.

1010
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:13,808
The one thing
that might matter more than a mission.

1011
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,049
Makes everything easier.

1012
01:08:19,440 --> 01:08:20,680
Even killing.

1013
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:28,843
You still think
you're the only monster on the team?

1014
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,122
So, we disappear?

1015
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:45,640
Thor didn't say
where he was going for answers?

1016
01:08:46,480 --> 01:08:49,006
Sometimes my teammates
don't tell me things.

1017
01:08:50,120 --> 01:08:52,168
I was kind of hoping
Thor would be the exception.

1018
01:08:52,280 --> 01:08:54,282
Yeah, give him time.

1019
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:56,363
We don't know
what the Maximoff kid showed him.

1020
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:00,164
"Earth's mightiest heroes."

1021
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:01,924
Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

1022
01:09:02,280 --> 01:09:03,760
Seems like you walked away all right.

1023
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:07,201
Is that a problem?

1024
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:09,483
I don't trust a guy without a dark side.

1025
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:11,727
Call me old-fashioned.

1026
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:14,411
Well, let's just say
you haven't seen it yet.

1027
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,927
You know Ultron is trying
to tear us apart, right?

1028
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:19,401
Well, I guess you'd know.

1029
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,806
Whether you'd tell us
is a bit of a question.

1030
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,086
Banner and I were doing research.

1031
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:24,440
- That would affect the team.
- That would end the team!

1032
01:09:24,680 --> 01:09:25,761
Isn't that the mission?

1033
01:09:25,960 --> 01:09:27,200
Isn't that the "Why We Fight"?

1034
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,561
So we can end the fight.
So we get to go home!

1035
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,167
Every time someone tries
to win a war before it starts,

1036
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,850
innocent people die.

1037
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:37,961
Every time.

1038
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:42,841
I'm sorry. Mr. Stark...

1039
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:44,880
Clint said you wouldn't mind,

1040
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,446
but our tractor doesn't seem
to want to start at all.

1041
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,120
- I thought maybe you might...
- Yeah, I'll give her a kick.

1042
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:55,130
Don't take from my pile.

1043
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,521
Hello, Deere.

1044
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:10,811
Tell me everything.

1045
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,405
What ails you?

1046
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,641
Do me a favour.

1047
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:18,809
Try not to bring it to life.

1048
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:20,485
Why, Ms. Barton, you little minx.

1049
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,366
I get it. Maria Hill called you, right?

1050
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:24,800
Was she ever not working for you?

1051
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,370
Artificial intelligence.

1052
01:10:27,400 --> 01:10:29,050
You never even hesitated.

1053
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:30,720
Look, it's been a really long day,

1054
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,404
like Eugene O'Neill long,

1055
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:34,680
so how's about
we skip to the part where you're useful.

1056
01:10:34,720 --> 01:10:35,960
Look me in the eye and tell me

1057
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,320
you're going to shut him down.

1058
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,051
You're not the director of me.

1059
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:41,003
I'm not the director of anybody.

1060
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:42,924
I'm just an old man

1061
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,170
who cares very much about you.

1062
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,849
And I'm the man
who killed the Avengers.

1063
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:52,806
I saw it.

1064
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,570
I didn't tell the team. How could I?

1065
01:10:55,840 --> 01:10:57,683
I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it.

1066
01:10:58,040 --> 01:10:59,565
The whole world, too.

1067
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,001
Because of me.

1068
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:03,685
I wasn't ready.

1069
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:06,571
I didn't do all I could.

1070
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,682
Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark.

1071
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,802
- Playing on your fear.
- I wasn't tricked, I was shown.

1072
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:16,207
Wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy.

1073
01:11:16,520 --> 01:11:18,682
The end of the path I started us on.

1074
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:21,800
You come up with some pretty
impressive inventions, Tony.

1075
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:25,371
War isn't one of them.

1076
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,405
I watched my friends die.

1077
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,682
You'd think that'd be
as bad as it gets, right?

1078
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,565
Nope.

1079
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,086
- It wasn't the worst part.
- The worst part

1080
01:11:40,120 --> 01:11:41,406
is that you didn't.

1081
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:49,280
I'll see you tonight.

1082
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,246
I like the look.

1083
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,926
If you're going for inconspicuous,
though, near miss.

1084
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:58,327
I need your help.

1085
01:11:58,560 --> 01:11:59,561
It's nice to be needed.

1086
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:01,325
It's dangerous.

1087
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,689
I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

1088
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,922
Ultron took you folks out of play
to buy himself time.

1089
01:12:10,280 --> 01:12:13,250
My contacts all say
he's building something.

1090
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,966
The amount of vibranium
he made off with,

1091
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,570
I don't think it's just one thing.

1092
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,011
What about Ultron himself?

1093
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:21,487
Oh, he's easy to track.
He's everywhere.

1094
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,287
The guy is multiplying faster
than a Catholic rabbit.

1095
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:27,770
It still doesn't help us get an angle
on any of his plans, though.

1096
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,081
Is he still going after launch codes?

1097
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,725
Yes, he is.

1098
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:32,330
But he's not making any headway.

1099
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:34,522
I cracked the Pentagon's firewall
in high school on a dare.

1100
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:37,246
Well, I contacted our friends
at the Nexus about that.

1101
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,321
Nexus?

1102
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:40,160
It's the world
Internet hub in Oslo.

1103
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:42,284
Every byte of data flows through there.

1104
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:43,567
Fastest access on Earth.

1105
01:12:43,720 --> 01:12:44,767
So, what did they say?

1106
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:46,764
He's fixated on the missiles.

1107
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:48,680
But the codes
are constantly being changed.

1108
01:12:49,160 --> 01:12:50,161
By whom?

1109
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:52,606
Parties unknown.

1110
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,926
Do we have an ally?

1111
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,361
Ultron's got an enemy.
That's not the same thing.

1112
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:58,563
Still, I'd pay folding money
to know who it is.

1113
01:12:58,680 --> 01:12:59,841
I might need to visit Oslo.

1114
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,481
Find our unknown.

1115
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,085
Well, this is good times, boss,

1116
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:04,486
but I was kind of hoping when I saw you,

1117
01:13:04,600 --> 01:13:05,640
you'd have more than that.

1118
01:13:05,880 --> 01:13:07,882
I do. I have you.

1119
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,524
Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere.

1120
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:11,966
Ears, everywhere else.

1121
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:15,324
You kids had all the tech
you could dream up.

1122
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,322
Here we all are, back on Earth,

1123
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,324
with nothing but our wit

1124
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:22,050
and our will to save the world.

1125
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:25,802
Ultron says the Avengers
are the only thing

1126
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,445
between him and his mission.

1127
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,722
And whether or not he admits it,

1128
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:32,611
his mission is global destruction.

1129
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:36,002
All this, laid in a grave.

1130
01:13:38,040 --> 01:13:39,724
So stand.

1131
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:42,249
Outwit the platinum bastard.

1132
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,360
Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

1133
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:45,641
You know what, Romanoff?

1134
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,171
So, what does he want?

1135
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:51,609
To become better.

1136
01:13:51,720 --> 01:13:53,085
Better than us.

1137
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:55,841
- He keeps building bodies.
- Person bodies.

1138
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,044
The human form is inefficient.

1139
01:13:58,200 --> 01:14:00,362
Biologically speaking, we're outmoded.

1140
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,448
But he keeps coming back to it.

1141
01:14:02,560 --> 01:14:04,680
When you two programmed him
to protect the human race,

1142
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,051
you amazingly failed.

1143
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:08,203
They don't need to be protected.

1144
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,410
They need to evolve.

1145
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:14,528
Ultron's going to evolve.

1146
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:15,767
How?

1147
01:14:17,080 --> 01:14:19,765
Has anyone been in contact
with Helen Cho?

1148
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,170
It's beautiful.

1149
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,524
The vibranium atoms aren't just
compatible with the tissue cells,

1150
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:29,880
they're binding them.

1151
01:14:30,360 --> 01:14:31,646
And S.H.I.E.L.D.
never even thought to...

1152
01:14:31,880 --> 01:14:34,451
The most versatile substance
on the planet,

1153
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:37,040
and they used it to make a Frisbee.

1154
01:14:37,240 --> 01:14:38,366
Typical of humans.

1155
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:41,086
They scratch the surface
and never think

1156
01:14:43,040 --> 01:14:44,565
to look within.

1157
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,525
I'll take Natasha and Clint.

1158
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,728
All right. Strictly recon.
I'll hit the Nexus.

1159
01:14:58,840 --> 01:14:59,966
I'll join you as soon as I can.

1160
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:01,605
If Ultron's really building a body...

1161
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,365
He'll be more powerful than any of us.

1162
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:04,641
Maybe all of us.

1163
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:06,969
An android designed by a robot.

1164
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,326
You know, I really miss the days

1165
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:10,608
when the weirdest thing
science ever created was me.

1166
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,850
I'll drop Banner off at the tower.

1167
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,286
You mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

1168
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,284
She's all yours. Apparently.

1169
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:17,601
What are you gonna do?

1170
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:20,843
I don't know.
Something dramatic, I hope.

1171
01:15:24,200 --> 01:15:25,929
I'm gonna finish reflooring that sunroom

1172
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:27,884
as soon as I get back.

1173
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:30,771
Yeah, then you'll find
another part of the house to tear apart.

1174
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:32,121
No.

1175
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,285
It's the last project.

1176
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:36,801
I promise.

1177
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:56,605
So, this is it.

1178
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:00,481
The Water of Sight.

1179
01:16:02,800 --> 01:16:05,201
In every realm,
there's a reflection.

1180
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:07,731
If the water's spirits accept me,

1181
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:09,848
I can return to my dream

1182
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,085
and find what I missed.

1183
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:16,166
Men who enter that water,
the legends don't end well.

1184
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,569
A hacker
who's faster than Ultron?

1185
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:20,807
He could be anywhere,

1186
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:23,161
and as this is the centre of everything,

1187
01:16:23,280 --> 01:16:24,406
I'm just a guy looking for a needle

1188
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:26,682
in the world's biggest haystack.

1189
01:16:27,680 --> 01:16:29,250
How do you find it?

1190
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:32,251
It's pretty simple. You bring a magnet.

1191
01:16:34,440 --> 01:16:35,560
<i>I'm decrypting nuclear codes</i>

1192
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:37,011
<i>And you don't want me to</i>

1193
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:40,810
Come and get me.

1194
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:54,207
Wake up!

1195
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,041
Thor!

1196
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:03,927
Extinction.

1197
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,528
Cellular cohesion
will take a few hours,

1198
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:22,121
but we can initiate
the consciousness stream.

1199
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,530
We're uploading your cerebral matrix

1200
01:17:25,720 --> 01:17:26,926
now.

1201
01:17:28,400 --> 01:17:29,970
I can read him.

1202
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,245
He's dreaming.

1203
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,289
I wouldn't call it dreams.

1204
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,363
It's Ultron's base consciousness.

1205
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,085
Informational noise. Soon...

1206
01:17:38,320 --> 01:17:39,446
How soon?

1207
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,011
I'm not being pushy.

1208
01:17:41,240 --> 01:17:42,920
We're imprinting
a physical brain.

1209
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:44,485
There are no shortcuts.

1210
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:45,966
Even if your magic gem...

1211
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:58,011
How could you?

1212
01:17:58,080 --> 01:17:59,127
How could I what?

1213
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,563
You said we would
destroy the Avengers,

1214
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:03,767
make a better world.

1215
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,127
It will be better.

1216
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,447
- When everyone is dead?
- That is not...

1217
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:13,246
The human race will have
every opportunity to improve.

1218
01:18:13,760 --> 01:18:15,091
And if they don't?

1219
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,406
Ask Noah.

1220
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,647
You are a madman.

1221
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:22,207
There were more than a dozen
extinction-level events

1222
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,443
before even the dinosaurs got theirs.

1223
01:18:25,560 --> 01:18:27,722
When the Earth starts to settle,

1224
01:18:28,240 --> 01:18:30,129
God throws a stone at it.

1225
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,601
And, believe me, he's winding up.

1226
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,566
We have to evolve.

1227
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:36,281
There's no room

1228
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,246
for the weak.

1229
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:40,448
And who decides who's weak?

1230
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,049
Life.

1231
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:45,489
Life always decides.

1232
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:49,487
There's incoming.

1233
01:18:50,960 --> 01:18:54,282
- The Quinjet. We have to move.
- That's not a problem.

1234
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,281
Wait, guys!

1235
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,606
They'll understand.

1236
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,048
When they see, they'll understand.

1237
01:19:10,440 --> 01:19:13,728
I just need a little more time.

1238
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:27,248
Two minutes. Stay close.

1239
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,441
Dr. Cho!

1240
01:19:39,360 --> 01:19:40,885
He's uploading himself into the body.

1241
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,047
Where?

1242
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,411
The real power is inside the Cradle.

1243
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:47,527
The gem,

1244
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,011
its power is uncontainable.

1245
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,530
You can't just blow it up.

1246
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,721
You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

1247
01:19:56,840 --> 01:19:57,887
First, I have to find it.

1248
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,201
Go.

1249
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:00,800
<i>Did you guys copy that?</i>

1250
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,041
We did.

1251
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:04,646
I got a private jet taking off across town.

1252
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,286
No manifest.

1253
01:20:06,400 --> 01:20:07,447
That could be him.

1254
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:09,970
There. It's a truck from the lab.

1255
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:11,326
Right above you, Cap.

1256
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,409
On the loop by the bridge.

1257
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,001
It's them.

1258
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,960
You got three with the Cradle,
one in the cab.

1259
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:18,840
I could take out the driver.

1260
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:20,040
<i>Negative. That truck crashes,</i>

1261
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,650
the gem could level the city.

1262
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:23,320
<i>We need to draw out Ultron.</i>

1263
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,088
No, no, no, no.

1264
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:37,967
Leave me alone!

1265
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:48,284
Well, he's definitely unhappy.

1266
01:20:48,440 --> 01:20:49,930
I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

1267
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:51,320
You're not a match for him, Cap.

1268
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,521
Thanks, Barton.

1269
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:17,480
You know what's in that cradle?

1270
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,529
The power to make real change.

1271
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:22,051
And that terrifies you.

1272
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:23,360
I wouldn't call it a comfort.

1273
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:27,647
Stop it.

1274
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:41,165
We got a window. Four, three...

1275
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:42,801
Give him hell.

1276
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,240
I'm always picking up after you boys.

1277
01:21:56,840 --> 01:21:58,490
They're heading under the overpass.
I've got no shot.

1278
01:21:58,840 --> 01:21:59,887
<i>Which way?</i>

1279
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,081
Hard right.

1280
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:03,321
Now.

1281
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:36,487
Out of the way! Coming through!
Sorry, coming through!

1282
01:22:52,240 --> 01:22:53,401
Come on!

1283
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,325
Clint,
can you draw out the guards?

1284
01:22:55,440 --> 01:22:56,487
Let's find out.

1285
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:58,567
Beep, beep!

1286
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:37,610
They're heading back towards you.

1287
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:39,320
So whatever you're gonna do, do it now.

1288
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:47,451
<i>I'm going in.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?</i>

1289
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,489
What do you think I've been doing?

1290
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,208
<i>Okay, package is airborne.</i>

1291
01:24:35,920 --> 01:24:37,001
I have a clean shot.

1292
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,805
Negative. I am still in the truck.

1293
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:39,961
- What the hell are you...
- Just be ready.

1294
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:41,360
I'm sending the package to you.

1295
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:43,040
How do you want me to take it?

1296
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,322
Uh, you might wish
you hadn't asked that.

1297
01:24:58,120 --> 01:24:59,849
Please, don't do this.

1298
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:01,930
What choice do we have?

1299
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:11,201
I lost him!

1300
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:12,725
He's headed your way!

1301
01:25:17,680 --> 01:25:18,727
Nat, we gotta go.

1302
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:31,849
Nat!

1303
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:36,881
Cap, you see Nat?

1304
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,411
If you have the package,
get it to Stark! Go!

1305
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:41,881
Do you have eyes on Nat?

1306
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,041
<i>Go!</i>

1307
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:46,041
Damn it.

1308
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:47,641
Civilians in our path.

1309
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,445
Can you stop this thing?

1310
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,651
I'm fine.

1311
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:32,444
I just need to take a minute.

1312
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,809
I'm very tempted not to give you one.

1313
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:36,849
The Cradle. Did you get it?

1314
01:26:37,040 --> 01:26:38,530
Stark will take care of it.

1315
01:26:39,920 --> 01:26:40,921
No, he won't.

1316
01:26:44,440 --> 01:26:45,646
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1317
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,760
Stark's not crazy.

1318
01:26:46,800 --> 01:26:48,928
He will do anything to make things right.

1319
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,086
Stark, come in.

1320
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:56,647
Stark.

1321
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:59,086
Anyone on comms.

1322
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,645
Ultron can't tell the difference

1323
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,121
between saving the world
and destroying it.

1324
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,486
Where do you think he gets that?

1325
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:11,250
- Anything on Nat?
- I haven't heard.

1326
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,727
But she's alive, or Ultron would
be rubbing our faces in it.

1327
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:15,171
This is sealed tight.

1328
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:16,840
We're gonna need
to access the program,

1329
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:18,803
break it down from within.

1330
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,400
Any chance Natasha might leave you

1331
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:22,766
a message outside the Internet?

1332
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,927
Old-school spy stuff?

1333
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:26,209
There are
some nets I can cast.

1334
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:27,560
Yeah, I'll find her.

1335
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,924
I can work on tissue degeneration

1336
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:35,249
if you could fry whatever
operational system Cho implanted.

1337
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:36,526
Yeah, about that.

1338
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:41,961
No.

1339
01:27:42,160 --> 01:27:44,003
- You have to trust me.
- Kind of don't.

1340
01:27:44,160 --> 01:27:48,210
Our ally, the guy protecting
the military's nuclear codes,

1341
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:51,161
I found him.

1342
01:27:51,240 --> 01:27:52,366
<i>Hello, Dr. Banner.</i>

1343
01:27:53,240 --> 01:27:55,521
Ultron didn't go after Jarvis
because he was angry.

1344
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:59,687
He attacked him because he was
scared of what he can do.

1345
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,490
So Jarvis went underground.

1346
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:04,090
Scattered, dumped his memory.

1347
01:28:04,680 --> 01:28:06,170
But not his protocols.

1348
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,047
He didn't even know he was in there
until I pieced him together.

1349
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:17,681
So, you want me to help you
put Jarvis into this thing?

1350
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:19,564
No! Of course not.

1351
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:21,404
I wanna help you put Jarvis in this thing.

1352
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:25,450
We're out of my field, here.

1353
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:27,562
You know bio-organics
better than anyone.

1354
01:28:27,880 --> 01:28:30,770
And you just assume
that Jarvis's operational matrix

1355
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:32,325
can beat Ultron's?

1356
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,728
Jarvis has been beating him
from inside without knowing it.

1357
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:36,881
This is the opportunity.

1358
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,724
We can create Ultron's perfect self

1359
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:42,362
without the homicidal glitches
he thinks are his winning personality.

1360
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:44,562
- We have to.
<i>- I believe it's worth a go.</i>

1361
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:48,241
I'm in a loop!

1362
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,370
I'm caught in a time loop.
This is exactly where it all went wrong.

1363
01:28:51,480 --> 01:28:53,400
I know. I know. I know
what everyone's gonna say.

1364
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,448
But they're already saying it.

1365
01:28:56,000 --> 01:28:57,161
We're mad scientists.

1366
01:28:57,920 --> 01:29:00,651
We're monsters, buddy.
We've gotta own it.

1367
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:02,880
Make a stand.

1368
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:09,770
It's not a loop.

1369
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:12,764
It's the end of the line.

1370
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,408
I wasn't sure you would wake up.

1371
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:38,967
I hoped you would.
I wanted to show you.

1372
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:40,804
I don't have anyone else.

1373
01:29:43,640 --> 01:29:47,247
I think a lot about meteors.
The purity in them.

1374
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,925
Boom! The end.

1375
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:50,811
Start again.

1376
01:29:50,960 --> 01:29:52,928
The world made clean

1377
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:55,361
for the new man to rebuild.

1378
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,808
I was meant to be new.

1379
01:29:58,680 --> 01:30:01,286
I was meant to be beautiful.

1380
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,968
The world would have looked to the sky

1381
01:30:04,080 --> 01:30:05,320
and seen hope,

1382
01:30:05,680 --> 01:30:07,011
seen mercy.

1383
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,882
Instead, they'll look up in horror

1384
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:11,331
because of you.

1385
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,329
You've wounded me.

1386
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,684
I give you full marks for that.

1387
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:19,244
But, like the man said,
what doesn't kill me...

1388
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:25,811
...just makes me stronger.

1389
01:31:05,880 --> 01:31:08,042
This framework is not compatible.

1390
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:10,885
The genetic coding tower is at 97%.

1391
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,846
You have got to upload that schematic
in the next three minutes.

1392
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,043
- I'm gonna say this once.
- How about "none-ce"?

1393
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,288
- Shut it down!
- Nope, not gonna happen.

1394
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:22,561
You don't know what you're doing.

1395
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,051
And you do?

1396
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:25,401
She's not in your head?

1397
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,210
I know you're angry.

1398
01:31:27,320 --> 01:31:28,685
Oh, we're way past that.

1399
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,246
I could choke the life out of you
and never change a shade.

1400
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:33,160
Banner, after everything
that's happened...

1401
01:31:33,240 --> 01:31:34,605
It's nothing compared to what's coming!

1402
01:31:34,720 --> 01:31:37,280
- You don't know what's in there.
- This isn't a game!

1403
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,811
No, no. Go on.

1404
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,683
You were saying?

1405
01:31:50,920 --> 01:31:51,967
Pietro!

1406
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:53,601
What?

1407
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:55,570
You didn't see that coming?

1408
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:58,921
I'm rerouting the upload.

1409
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,004
Go ahead, piss me off.

1410
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:20,446
Wait!

1411
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:47,361
I am sorry. That was

1412
01:33:48,360 --> 01:33:49,771
odd.

1413
01:33:50,000 --> 01:33:51,240
Thank you.

1414
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,207
Thor.

1415
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:01,326
- You helped create this?
- I've had a vision.

1416
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:05,281
A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life,
and at its centre is that.

1417
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:07,241
What? The gem?

1418
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:09,971
It's the Mind Stone.
It's one of the six Infinity Stones.

1419
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:11,360
The greatest power in the universe,

1420
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,642
unparalleled in
its destructive capabilities.

1421
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,880
- Then why would you bring...
- Because Stark is right.

1422
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:18,366
Oh, it's definitely the end times.

1423
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:19,721
The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

1424
01:34:19,880 --> 01:34:21,120
Not alone.

1425
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,443
Why does your Vision sound like Jarvis?

1426
01:34:23,560 --> 01:34:26,245
We reconfigured Jarvis's matrix

1427
01:34:26,760 --> 01:34:28,524
to create something new.

1428
01:34:28,760 --> 01:34:30,444
I think I've had my fill of new.

1429
01:34:30,600 --> 01:34:32,887
You think I'm a child of Ultron.

1430
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,526
You're not?

1431
01:34:35,680 --> 01:34:37,250
I'm not Ultron.

1432
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:40,087
I am not Jarvis. I am...

1433
01:34:42,200 --> 01:34:43,611
I am.

1434
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,646
I looked in your head

1435
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,124
and saw annihilation.

1436
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:50,645
Look again.

1437
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:52,280
Her seal of approval means jack to me.

1438
01:34:52,760 --> 01:34:54,762
Their powers, the horrors in our heads,

1439
01:34:54,920 --> 01:34:56,968
Ultron himself, they all came
from the Mind Stone.

1440
01:34:57,120 --> 01:34:59,282
And they're nothing
compared to what it can unleash.

1441
01:34:59,440 --> 01:35:01,200
- But with it on our side...
- Is it?

1442
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:03,561
Are you?

1443
01:35:04,440 --> 01:35:05,885
On our side?

1444
01:35:07,760 --> 01:35:09,649
I don't think it's that simple.

1445
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:12,246
Well, it better
get real simple real soon.

1446
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,528
I am on the side of life.

1447
01:35:15,760 --> 01:35:17,125
Ultron isn't.

1448
01:35:17,720 --> 01:35:19,131
He will end it all.

1449
01:35:19,280 --> 01:35:21,203
What's he waiting for?

1450
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,361
- You.
- Where?

1451
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,961
Sokovia.

1452
01:35:24,080 --> 01:35:25,161
He's got Nat there, too.

1453
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:28,970
If we're wrong about you,

1454
01:35:31,640 --> 01:35:33,640
if you're the monster
that Ultron made you to be...

1455
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:35,685
What will you do?

1456
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:44,402
I don't want to kill Ultron.

1457
01:35:44,800 --> 01:35:48,122
He's unique and he's in pain.

1458
01:35:49,680 --> 01:35:52,251
But that pain will roll over the Earth.

1459
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:55,087
So, he must be destroyed.

1460
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:58,244
Every form he's built,
every trace of his presence on the net.

1461
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,170
We have to act now.

1462
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:04,525
And not one of us
can do it without the others.

1463
01:36:06,520 --> 01:36:08,443
Maybe I am a monster.

1464
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:10,841
I don't think I'd know if I were one.

1465
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,604
I'm not what you are,

1466
01:36:14,280 --> 01:36:16,442
and not what you intended.

1467
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,680
So, there may be no way
to make you trust me.

1468
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:21,371
But we need to go.

1469
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:37,321
Right.

1470
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:39,200
Well done.

1471
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,007
Three minutes.

1472
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:44,370
Get what you need.

1473
01:37:00,200 --> 01:37:01,280
<i>Good evening, boss.</i>

1474
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,084
<i>No way we all get through this.</i>

1475
01:37:08,200 --> 01:37:10,280
<i>If even one tin soldier
is left standing, we've lost.</i>

1476
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:12,440
There's gonna be blood on the floor.

1477
01:37:12,480 --> 01:37:13,891
I got no plans tomorrow night.

1478
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,600
I get first crack at the big guy.

1479
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,250
Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

1480
01:37:17,360 --> 01:37:19,761
That's true. He hates you the most.

1481
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:27,242
Ultron knows we're coming.

1482
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:29,727
Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire.

1483
01:37:30,240 --> 01:37:31,969
And that's what we signed up for.

1484
01:37:32,240 --> 01:37:34,766
But the people of Sokovia, they didn't.

1485
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,370
<i>So our priority</i>

1486
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:39,161
<i>is getting them out.</i>

1487
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,324
We're under attack! Clear the city! Now!

1488
01:37:50,120 --> 01:37:51,565
Get off your asses.

1489
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:54,920
<i>All they want
is to live their lives in peace.</i>

1490
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:56,640
<i>And that's not gonna happen today.</i>

1491
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:00,009
<i>But we can do our best to protect them.</i>

1492
01:38:00,720 --> 01:38:02,245
<i>And we can get the job done.</i>

1493
01:38:05,640 --> 01:38:07,927
<i>We find out what Ultron's been building,</i>

1494
01:38:08,880 --> 01:38:10,484
<i>we find Romanoff,</i>

1495
01:38:10,960 --> 01:38:12,803
<i>and we clear the field.</i>

1496
01:38:14,240 --> 01:38:16,163
<i>Keep the fight between us.</i>

1497
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:25,281
Ultron thinks we're monsters.

1498
01:38:25,800 --> 01:38:28,201
That we're what's wrong with the world.

1499
01:38:28,320 --> 01:38:30,641
This isn't just about beating him.

1500
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:33,208
It's about whether he's right.

1501
01:38:39,680 --> 01:38:40,727
Natasha!

1502
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:42,841
Natasha!

1503
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:44,081
Bruce?

1504
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:46,521
You all right?

1505
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:47,727
Yeah.

1506
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,569
The team is in the city.
It's about to light up.

1507
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:51,840
I don't suppose you found
a key lying around somewhere.

1508
01:38:52,160 --> 01:38:54,288
Yeah. I did.

1509
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:01,841
So what's our play?

1510
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:03,405
I'm here to get you to safety.

1511
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:06,686
- Job's not finished.
- We could help with the evacuation,

1512
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,683
but I can't be in a fight near civilians.

1513
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:11,201
And you've done plenty.

1514
01:39:13,600 --> 01:39:15,090
Our fight is over.

1515
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:18,721
So, we just disappear?

1516
01:39:22,880 --> 01:39:24,723
Come on.

1517
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,761
<i>Your man's
in the church, boss.</i>

1518
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:33,723
<i>I think he's waiting for you.</i>

1519
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:39,848
Come to confess your sins?

1520
01:39:39,960 --> 01:39:41,200
I don't know. How much time you got?

1521
01:39:41,360 --> 01:39:42,850
More than you.

1522
01:39:44,080 --> 01:39:45,127
Uh...

1523
01:39:45,240 --> 01:39:48,050
Have you been juicing?
Little vibranium cocktail?

1524
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:50,447
You're looking...
I don't wanna say "puffy."

1525
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,289
You're stalling to protect the people.

1526
01:39:52,680 --> 01:39:55,524
Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

1527
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:58,320
I've moved beyond
your mission. I'm free.

1528
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:04,127
What?

1529
01:40:05,040 --> 01:40:07,361
You think you were
the only one stalling?

1530
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,730
<i>There's the rest
of the vibranium.</i>

1531
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,251
<i>Function, still unclear.</i>

1532
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:12,800
This is how you end, Tony.

1533
01:40:13,880 --> 01:40:15,644
This is peace in my time.

1534
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:33,407
Go!

1535
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:40,291
Get off the bridge!

1536
01:40:44,440 --> 01:40:45,441
Run!

1537
01:40:47,440 --> 01:40:49,249
Ultron.

1538
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:55,966
My Vision.

1539
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,487
They really did take everything from me.

1540
01:40:58,640 --> 01:41:00,688
You set the terms.
You can change them.

1541
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,040
All right.

1542
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:27,480
Friday, the Vision?

1543
01:41:27,640 --> 01:41:29,800
<i>Boss, it's working.
He's burning Ultron out of the net.</i>

1544
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:31,040
<i>He won't escape through there.</i>

1545
01:41:36,120 --> 01:41:37,451
You shut me out.

1546
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:39,126
You think I care?

1547
01:41:41,120 --> 01:41:42,326
You take away my world,

1548
01:41:43,200 --> 01:41:44,929
I take away yours.

1549
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:30,686
Friday.

1550
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:33,246
<i>Sokovia is going for a ride.</i>

1551
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,250
Do you see

1552
01:42:47,720 --> 01:42:49,245
the beauty of it?

1553
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,683
The inevitability.

1554
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:55,163
You rise, only to fall.

1555
01:42:57,920 --> 01:43:00,764
<i>You, Avengers, you are my meteor.</i>

1556
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:03,409
<i>My swift and terrible sword.</i>

1557
01:43:03,600 --> 01:43:05,090
<i>And the earth will crack</i>

1558
01:43:05,280 --> 01:43:07,203
<i>with the weight of your failure.</i>

1559
01:43:08,880 --> 01:43:12,646
<i>Purge me from your computers,
turn my own flesh against me.</i>

1560
01:43:13,120 --> 01:43:14,531
<i>It means nothing.</i>

1561
01:43:15,600 --> 01:43:16,965
<i>When the dust settles,</i>

1562
01:43:17,120 --> 01:43:19,009
<i>the only thing living in this world</i>

1563
01:43:19,520 --> 01:43:20,521
<i>will be metal.</i>

1564
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,650
We gotta move.

1565
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,080
You're not gonna turn green?

1566
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:30,200
I've got a compelling reason
not to lose my cool.

1567
01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,646
I adore you.

1568
01:43:41,280 --> 01:43:43,203
But I need the other guy.

1569
01:43:48,040 --> 01:43:49,804
Let's finish the job.

1570
01:44:06,600 --> 01:44:08,011
I really hope this makes us even.

1571
01:44:10,320 --> 01:44:12,368
Now go be a hero.

1572
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:22,800
<i>The vibranium core's
got a magnetic field.</i>

1573
01:44:22,920 --> 01:44:24,922
<i>That's what's keeping the rock together.</i>

1574
01:44:25,040 --> 01:44:26,087
If it drops?

1575
01:44:26,160 --> 01:44:27,491
<i>Right now, the impact
will kill thousands.</i>

1576
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:30,291
<i>Once it gets high enough?
Global extinction.</i>

1577
01:44:34,600 --> 01:44:36,682
<i>That building's not clear. The 10th floor.</i>

1578
01:44:41,560 --> 01:44:42,561
Hi.

1579
01:44:43,680 --> 01:44:46,047
Okay. Get in the tub!

1580
01:44:52,880 --> 01:44:54,800
<i>I got airborne,
heading up to the bridge.</i>

1581
01:44:57,520 --> 01:44:58,726
Cap, you got incoming.

1582
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:00,530
Incoming already came in.

1583
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,680
Stark, you worry about
bringing the city back down safely.

1584
01:45:06,400 --> 01:45:08,209
<i>The rest of us have one job,</i>

1585
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:09,521
<i>tear these things apart.</i>

1586
01:45:09,840 --> 01:45:11,444
<i>You get hurt, hurt them back.</i>

1587
01:45:12,120 --> 01:45:13,281
<i>You get killed,</i>

1588
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:15,606
walk it off.

1589
01:45:50,040 --> 01:45:51,246
Go, go, go!

1590
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:58,684
How could I let this happen?

1591
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,848
- Hey, hey, you okay?
- This is all our fault.

1592
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:03,240
Hey, look at me.
It's your fault, it's everyone's fault.

1593
01:46:03,280 --> 01:46:04,327
Who cares?

1594
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:05,965
Are you up for this?

1595
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:07,161
Are you?

1596
01:46:07,400 --> 01:46:08,447
Look, I just need to know.

1597
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:10,807
Because the city is flying.

1598
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:12,963
Okay. Look, the city is flying,

1599
01:46:13,080 --> 01:46:15,003
we're fighting an army of robots,

1600
01:46:15,920 --> 01:46:17,126
and I have a bow and arrow.

1601
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:18,361
None of this makes sense.

1602
01:46:21,640 --> 01:46:23,768
But I'm going back out there
because it's my job.

1603
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,291
Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit.

1604
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:30,444
It doesn't matter
what you did or what you were.

1605
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,246
If you go out there, you fight,
and you fight to kill.

1606
01:46:34,280 --> 01:46:36,920
Stay in here, you're good.
I'll send your brother to come find you.

1607
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:38,803
But if you step out that door,

1608
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:40,721
you are an Avenger.

1609
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:47,409
All right. Good chat.

1610
01:46:51,160 --> 01:46:52,207
Yeah, the city is flying.

1611
01:47:26,200 --> 01:47:27,361
I got you!

1612
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:28,920
Just look at me!

1613
01:47:35,680 --> 01:47:37,011
<i>You can't save them all.</i>

1614
01:47:38,360 --> 01:47:39,407
You'll never...

1615
01:47:40,680 --> 01:47:43,126
"Never" what? You didn't finish!

1616
01:47:46,880 --> 01:47:48,450
What, were you napping?

1617
01:48:09,920 --> 01:48:11,001
Thor.

1618
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,204
You're bothering me.

1619
01:48:23,240 --> 01:48:24,241
Ow!

1620
01:48:50,600 --> 01:48:51,880
All right, we're all clear here.

1621
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:53,007
We are not clear!

1622
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:54,531
We are very not clear!

1623
01:48:57,600 --> 01:48:58,931
All right, coming to you.

1624
01:48:59,400 --> 01:49:01,482
Keep up, old man!

1625
01:49:03,240 --> 01:49:04,765
Nobody would know.

1626
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:06,647
Nobody.

1627
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,524
"The last I saw him,
an Ultron was sitting on him.

1628
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:13,529
"Yeah, he'll be missed,
that quick little bastard.

1629
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,601
"I miss him already."

1630
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:31,321
Hold your fire!

1631
01:49:41,200 --> 01:49:42,247
Romanoff!

1632
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:43,761
Thanks!

1633
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:54,800
<i>The anti-gravs
are rigged to flip.</i>

1634
01:49:54,880 --> 01:49:57,042
<i>Touch them, they'll go
full reverse thrust.</i>

1635
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,605
<i>The city's not coming down slow.</i>

1636
01:49:58,720 --> 01:49:59,846
Spire is vibranium.

1637
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,086
If I get Thor to hit it...

1638
01:50:01,360 --> 01:50:02,725
<i>It will crack. That's not enough.</i>

1639
01:50:02,840 --> 01:50:04,365
<i>The impact would still be devastating.</i>

1640
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:05,851
Maybe if we can
cap the other end.

1641
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:07,690
Keep the atomic action doubling back.

1642
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,320
<i>That could vaporise the city.</i>

1643
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:12,043
<i>And everyone on it.</i>

1644
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,723
The next wave
is gonna hit any minute.

1645
01:50:19,880 --> 01:50:22,000
- What do you got, Stark?
<i>- Huh? Nothing great.</i>

1646
01:50:22,640 --> 01:50:24,881
Maybe a way to blow up the city.

1647
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,286
That'll keep it
from impacting the surface,

1648
01:50:26,400 --> 01:50:27,447
if you guys can get clear.

1649
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,609
I asked for a solution,
not an escape plan.

1650
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:32,730
<i>Impact radius
is getting bigger every second.</i>

1651
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:34,285
<i>We're gonna have to make a choice.</i>

1652
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:36,840
Cap,
these people are going nowhere.

1653
01:50:37,400 --> 01:50:40,200
- If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
- Not till everyone's safe.

1654
01:50:40,600 --> 01:50:43,604
Everyone up here versus everyone
down there? There's no math there.

1655
01:50:43,840 --> 01:50:45,800
I'm not leaving this rock
with one civilian on it.

1656
01:50:45,840 --> 01:50:47,285
I didn't say we should leave.

1657
01:50:50,120 --> 01:50:51,929
There's worse ways to go.

1658
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,846
Where else am I gonna get
a view like this?

1659
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:03,326
<i>Glad
you like the view, Romanoff.</i>

1660
01:51:03,440 --> 01:51:05,044
<i>It's about to get better.</i>

1661
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:30,366
<i>Nice, right?</i>

1662
01:51:30,480 --> 01:51:32,926
Pulled her out of mothballs
with a couple of old friends.

1663
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:34,730
She's dusty, but she'll do.

1664
01:51:35,080 --> 01:51:36,525
Fury, you son of a bitch.

1665
01:51:36,680 --> 01:51:38,967
Ooh! You kiss your mother
with that mouth?

1666
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:41,287
Altitude is 18,000 and climbing.

1667
01:51:41,440 --> 01:51:42,965
Lifeboats secure to deploy.

1668
01:51:43,080 --> 01:51:45,765
Disengage in three, two...

1669
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:47,961
Take them out.

1670
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,165
This is S.H.I.E.L.D.?

1671
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:01,726
This is what S.H.I.E.L.D.
is supposed to be.

1672
01:52:03,400 --> 01:52:04,811
This is not so bad.

1673
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:09,411
Let's load them up.

1674
01:52:14,800 --> 01:52:16,165
Sir, we have multiple bogies

1675
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:18,641
converging on our starboard flank.

1676
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,206
Show 'em what we got.

1677
01:52:20,560 --> 01:52:21,561
You're up.

1678
01:52:26,840 --> 01:52:27,841
Yes!

1679
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:29,844
Now this is gonna be a good story.

1680
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,562
Yup. if you live to tell it.

1681
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:36,722
You think
I can't hold my own?

1682
01:52:36,840 --> 01:52:38,440
We get through this, I'll hold your own.

1683
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:40,363
You had to make it weird.

1684
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:48,170
I got about 50 to 100 more
coming in after this group.

1685
01:53:05,120 --> 01:53:06,531
Here we go. Here we go. Let's move.

1686
01:53:06,880 --> 01:53:08,200
Let's go, everyone!

1687
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,482
Number six boat is topped and locked...

1688
01:53:12,600 --> 01:53:15,001
Or stocked... Topped...

1689
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,965
It's full of people.

1690
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:19,801
Incoming!

1691
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:23,887
Oh, God!

1692
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,920
<i>You think
you're saving anyone?</i>

1693
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:39,522
I turn that key and
drop this rock a little early

1694
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:41,762
and it's still billions dead.

1695
01:53:42,240 --> 01:53:43,401
Even you can't stop that.

1696
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,961
I am Thor, son of Odin,

1697
01:53:46,080 --> 01:53:48,401
and as long as
there is life in my breast...

1698
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:52,081
I am running out of things to say!
Are you ready?

1699
01:53:59,760 --> 01:54:01,200
It's terribly well-balanced.

1700
01:54:01,240 --> 01:54:04,722
Well, if there's too much weight,
you lose power on the swing, so...

1701
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:08,331
I got it. Create a heat seal.

1702
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:09,807
I could...

1703
01:54:09,880 --> 01:54:12,281
I could supercharge
the spire from below.

1704
01:54:12,440 --> 01:54:13,487
<i>Running numbers.</i>

1705
01:54:23,600 --> 01:54:25,520
<i>A heat seal could work
with enough power.</i>

1706
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:27,762
- Thor, I got a plan.
<i>- We're out of time.</i>

1707
01:54:27,960 --> 01:54:29,166
<i>They're coming for the core.</i>

1708
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,089
Rhodey, get the rest of the people
on board that carrier.

1709
01:54:31,240 --> 01:54:34,449
- On it.
- Avengers, time to work for a living.

1710
01:54:43,560 --> 01:54:44,800
- Are you good?
- Yeah.

1711
01:54:46,280 --> 01:54:47,327
Romanoff.

1712
01:54:47,480 --> 01:54:49,881
You and Banner better not be
playing "hide the zucchini."

1713
01:54:49,960 --> 01:54:51,041
<i>Relax, shellhead.</i>

1714
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:52,885
Not all of us can fly.

1715
01:54:58,640 --> 01:55:00,324
- What's the drill?
- This is the drill.

1716
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,642
If Ultron gets a hand
on the core, we lose.

1717
01:55:07,240 --> 01:55:09,242
Is that the best you can do?

1718
01:55:19,120 --> 01:55:20,690
You had to ask.

1719
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:23,121
This is the best I can do.

1720
01:55:23,240 --> 01:55:24,890
This is exactly what I wanted.

1721
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,571
All of you

1722
01:55:26,680 --> 01:55:28,330
against all of me.

1723
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:30,807
How can you possibly hope to stop me?

1724
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,523
Well, like the old man said...

1725
01:55:34,840 --> 01:55:35,841
Together.

1726
01:57:04,760 --> 01:57:07,161
You know, with the benefit of hindsight...

1727
01:57:16,440 --> 01:57:17,441
They'll try to leave the city.

1728
01:57:17,600 --> 01:57:19,284
We can't let them,
not even one. Rhodey.

1729
01:57:19,640 --> 01:57:20,721
I'm on it.

1730
01:57:21,120 --> 01:57:22,600
Oh, no. I didn't say you could leave.

1731
01:57:23,120 --> 01:57:25,202
War Machine coming at you! Right...

1732
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:32,965
Okay, what?

1733
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:35,202
We gotta move out.
Even I can tell the air is getting thin.

1734
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,646
You guys get to the boats.

1735
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,640
I'll sweep for stragglers.
Be right behind you.

1736
01:57:38,800 --> 01:57:41,246
- What about the core?
- I'll protect it.

1737
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,201
It's my job.

1738
01:57:45,320 --> 01:57:46,481
Nat.

1739
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:47,761
This way.

1740
01:57:52,160 --> 01:57:53,321
Get the people on the boats.

1741
01:57:53,480 --> 01:57:54,481
I'm not going to leave you here.

1742
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:55,687
I can handle this.

1743
01:57:58,000 --> 01:57:59,240
Come back for me
when everyone else is off.

1744
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:00,970
Not before.

1745
01:58:01,600 --> 01:58:02,726
You understand?

1746
01:58:03,760 --> 01:58:05,444
You know,
I'm 12 minutes older than you.

1747
01:58:05,840 --> 01:58:06,921
Go.

1748
01:58:08,480 --> 01:58:10,005
<i>Boss,
power levels are way below...</i>

1749
01:58:10,120 --> 01:58:12,282
Reroute everything.
We get one shot at this.

1750
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:18,560
I know what I need to do.

1751
01:58:18,840 --> 01:58:19,887
The dining room.

1752
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:21,366
If I knock out that east wall,

1753
01:58:22,080 --> 01:58:23,720
it'd make a nice workspace
for Laura, huh?

1754
01:58:25,200 --> 01:58:26,361
Put up some baffling.

1755
01:58:26,480 --> 01:58:28,761
She can't hear the kids running around.
What do you think?

1756
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:29,881
You guys always eat
in the kitchen anyway.

1757
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:31,565
No one eats in a dining room.

1758
01:58:37,240 --> 01:58:38,360
We don't have a lot of time.

1759
01:58:38,960 --> 01:58:40,928
So get your ass on a boat.

1760
01:58:53,880 --> 01:58:55,006
Hey, big guy.

1761
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,564
Sun's getting real low.

1762
01:58:59,080 --> 01:59:01,731
You're safe now.
You're gonna be okay. Buckle up.

1763
01:59:04,280 --> 01:59:05,850
Secure your gear, find a seat.

1764
01:59:05,960 --> 01:59:07,246
Costel!

1765
01:59:08,320 --> 01:59:09,446
We were in the market.

1766
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:10,607
Costel!

1767
01:59:25,320 --> 01:59:27,368
Thor, I'm gonna
need you back in the church.

1768
01:59:27,480 --> 01:59:28,925
- Is this the last of them?
- Yeah.

1769
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:31,920
- Everyone else is on the carrier.
<i>- You know, this works,</i>

1770
01:59:32,240 --> 01:59:33,651
we maybe don't walk away.

1771
01:59:34,360 --> 01:59:35,361
Maybe not.

1772
01:59:54,600 --> 01:59:58,127
<i>I got no strings, so I have fun</i>

1773
01:59:58,600 --> 02:00:01,285
<i>I'm not tied up to anyone</i>

1774
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,211
Come on. Time to go.

1775
02:00:36,640 --> 02:00:38,688
You didn't see that coming?

1776
02:01:34,960 --> 02:01:36,724
Oh, for God's sake.

1777
02:01:53,000 --> 02:01:54,764
- Zrinka!
- Costel! Baby!

1778
02:02:07,240 --> 02:02:08,241
No, no, I'm fine.

1779
02:02:08,400 --> 02:02:09,401
Fine.

1780
02:02:11,240 --> 02:02:13,288
It's been a long day.

1781
02:02:27,840 --> 02:02:29,046
Wanda.

1782
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:33,003
If you stay here, you'll die.

1783
02:02:34,600 --> 02:02:35,965
I just did.

1784
02:02:36,760 --> 02:02:38,524
Do you know how it felt?

1785
02:02:52,600 --> 02:02:54,967
It felt like that.

1786
02:03:29,960 --> 02:03:31,610
Thor, on my mark.

1787
02:03:46,680 --> 02:03:47,681
Now!

1788
02:04:15,680 --> 02:04:18,126
<i>Hey, big guy. We did it.</i>

1789
02:04:19,160 --> 02:04:20,844
<i>The job is finished.</i>

1790
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:23,725
<i>Now I need you to turn
this bird around, okay?</i>

1791
02:04:28,040 --> 02:04:29,849
We can't track you in stealth mode.

1792
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:34,088
<i>So help me out. I need you...</i>

1793
02:05:19,760 --> 02:05:20,761
You're afraid.

1794
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:22,841
Of you?

1795
02:05:23,520 --> 02:05:24,681
Of death.

1796
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:27,209
You're the last one.

1797
02:05:27,440 --> 02:05:29,886
You were supposed to be the last.

1798
02:05:30,120 --> 02:05:32,407
Stark asked for a saviour

1799
02:05:33,440 --> 02:05:35,124
and settled for a slave.

1800
02:05:35,240 --> 02:05:37,641
I suppose we are both disappointments.

1801
02:05:40,120 --> 02:05:41,360
I suppose we are.

1802
02:05:42,080 --> 02:05:43,241
Humans are odd.

1803
02:05:45,080 --> 02:05:48,721
They think order and chaos
are somehow opposites

1804
02:05:50,480 --> 02:05:51,811
and try to control what won't be.

1805
02:05:53,520 --> 02:05:55,966
But there is grace in their failings.

1806
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:58,203
I think you missed that.

1807
02:05:58,880 --> 02:05:59,961
They're doomed.

1808
02:06:00,880 --> 02:06:01,927
Yes.

1809
02:06:06,160 --> 02:06:09,084
But a thing isn't beautiful
because it lasts.

1810
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:13,162
It's a privilege to be among them.

1811
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:15,926
You're unbearably naive.

1812
02:06:16,200 --> 02:06:17,406
Well...

1813
02:06:19,480 --> 02:06:21,528
I was born yesterday.

1814
02:07:34,160 --> 02:07:36,242
<i>Look! Say hi to Auntie Nat!</i>

1815
02:07:37,600 --> 02:07:38,601
Fat.

1816
02:07:39,720 --> 02:07:41,280
One of our tech boys
flagged this.

1817
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:44,362
Splashed down in the Banda Sea.

1818
02:07:45,480 --> 02:07:47,005
Could be the Quinjet.

1819
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:49,044
But with Stark's stealth tech,

1820
02:07:49,160 --> 02:07:50,730
we still can't track the damn thing.

1821
02:07:52,280 --> 02:07:53,645
Right.

1822
02:07:54,080 --> 02:07:56,321
Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji.

1823
02:07:57,600 --> 02:07:59,489
He'll send a postcard.

1824
02:07:59,760 --> 02:08:01,489
"Wish you were here."

1825
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:06,728
You sent me to recruit him
way back when.

1826
02:08:08,560 --> 02:08:11,131
Did you know then
what was gonna happen?

1827
02:08:13,320 --> 02:08:15,243
You never know.

1828
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:18,967
You hope for the best,
then make do with what you get.

1829
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:20,930
I got a great team.

1830
02:08:22,040 --> 02:08:24,008
Nothing lasts forever.

1831
02:08:24,280 --> 02:08:26,328
Trouble, Ms. Romanoff.

1832
02:08:26,560 --> 02:08:29,928
No matter who wins or loses,
trouble still comes around.

1833
02:08:33,800 --> 02:08:35,040
<i>The rules have changed.</i>

1834
02:08:35,200 --> 02:08:36,804
We're dealing
with something new.

1835
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,246
Oh, the Vision is artificial intelligence.

1836
02:08:38,360 --> 02:08:40,283
- A machine.
- So, it doesn't count?

1837
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:42,289
No, it's not like
a person lifting the hammer.

1838
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:44,210
Right, different rules for us.

1839
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:45,487
- Nice guy. Artificial.
- Thank you.

1840
02:08:45,680 --> 02:08:48,570
He can wield the hammer,
he can keep the Mind Stone.

1841
02:08:49,480 --> 02:08:51,562
It's safe with the Vision.

1842
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:54,326
And these days, safe is in short supply.

1843
02:08:56,360 --> 02:08:58,328
But if you put the hammer
in an elevator...

1844
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:00,320
- It would still go up.
- Elevator's not worthy.

1845
02:09:00,360 --> 02:09:02,169
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.

1846
02:09:02,320 --> 02:09:03,845
Not if you don't leave.

1847
02:09:04,080 --> 02:09:05,809
I have no choice.

1848
02:09:06,040 --> 02:09:08,202
The Mind Stone
is the fourth of the Infinity Stones

1849
02:09:08,320 --> 02:09:09,731
to show up in the last few years.

1850
02:09:09,840 --> 02:09:11,410
It's not a coincidence.

1851
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,004
Someone has been playing
an intricate game

1852
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:15,810
and has made pawns of us.

1853
02:09:15,920 --> 02:09:17,809
And once all these pieces
are in position...

1854
02:09:17,920 --> 02:09:19,331
Triple Yahtzee.

1855
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:21,005
You think you can find out
what's coming?

1856
02:09:21,120 --> 02:09:22,201
I do.

1857
02:09:23,040 --> 02:09:24,530
Besides this one,

1858
02:09:24,640 --> 02:09:27,007
there's nothing that can't be explained.

1859
02:09:34,320 --> 02:09:36,846
That man has no regard
for lawn maintenance.

1860
02:09:40,000 --> 02:09:42,606
I'm gonna miss him, though.
And you're gonna miss me.

1861
02:09:42,720 --> 02:09:44,290
There's gonna be a lot of manful tears.

1862
02:09:46,480 --> 02:09:48,130
I will miss you, Tony.

1863
02:09:48,360 --> 02:09:49,361
Yeah?

1864
02:09:49,520 --> 02:09:51,966
Well, it's time for me to tap out.

1865
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,362
Maybe I should
take a page out of Barton's book.

1866
02:09:54,520 --> 02:09:57,444
Build Pepper a farm,
hope nobody blows it up.

1867
02:09:58,240 --> 02:09:59,401
The simple life.

1868
02:09:59,680 --> 02:10:01,967
- You'll get there one day.
- I don't know.

1869
02:10:02,200 --> 02:10:04,601
Family, stability...

1870
02:10:05,760 --> 02:10:08,889
The guy who wanted all that
went in the ice 75 years ago.

1871
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:12,243
I think someone else came out.

1872
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:17,281
You all right?

1873
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,405
I'm home.

1874
02:10:29,320 --> 02:10:32,085
You wanna keep staring at the wall,
or do you wanna go to work?

1875
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:33,571
I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

1876
02:10:33,760 --> 02:10:36,764
I thought you and Tony
were still gazing into each other's eyes.

1877
02:10:36,840 --> 02:10:37,887
How do we look?

1878
02:10:38,120 --> 02:10:40,407
Well, we're not the '27 Yankees.

1879
02:10:40,560 --> 02:10:42,244
We got some hitters.

1880
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:44,801
They're good. They're not a team.

1881
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,610
Let's beat them into shape.

1882
02:11:05,080 --> 02:11:06,605
Avengers...

1883
02:13:25,440 --> 02:13:26,885
Fine.

1884
02:13:28,320 --> 02:13:30,163
I'll do it myself.

1885
02:13:31,305 --> 02:14:31,243
