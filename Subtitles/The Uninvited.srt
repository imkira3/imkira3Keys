1
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,560
I love you,

2
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,280
and I have a condom.

3
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,720
- Matt, I shouldn't be here.
- Come on, Anna.

4
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,600
- No. No.
- Come on, it'll be fun.

5
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,680
I really shouldn't be here.

6
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,280
Anna. Come on.

7
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,480
I'm at a party,

8
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,400
but all I want to do is get home.

9
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,600
Hey, where you going? Anna?

10
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,960
Don't go home.

11
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,240
And then I hear my mother's bell.

12
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,120
I go to find her.

13
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,720
When she got sick,
we moved her into the boathouse.

14
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,040
It's where she wanted to be.

15
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,080
She's alone.

16
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
She's not supposed to be alone.

17
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,880
Anna.

18
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,600
I run up to the house to find my dad.

19
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,840
There's something wrong.

20
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,800
It doesn't feel safe.

21
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,120
There's something evil in the house.

22
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,920
One way or another,
these dreams seem to be

23
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,480
about trying to get out of the woods
and back home.

24
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,760
Yeah.

25
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,560
And when I get there, it's like
Mom's trying to tell me something.

26
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,320
But I can't understand what it is,
what she's trying to say.

27
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,640
Well, we've talked about
the little redheaded girl,

28
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,880
but now there's a new detail,
the watering can.

29
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,720
Why do you think you were holding it?

30
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,880
I don't know.

31
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,240
I really don't remember.

32
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,040
Maybe you were trying
to put out the fire.

33
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,440
When my mom first got sick,
she said that she'd always be there.

34
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,240
Could be a stray cat,
orjust the sound of the wind,

35
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,200
but it would always be her.
She'd always protect us, you know.

36
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,920
But...

37
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,960
But the night of the fire,
I couldn't protect her.

38
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,480
Smart girl.

39
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,360
If I'm so smart, why can't I remember
what happened that night?

40
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,280
Okay. Here's what I think.

41
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,560
We survive by remembering,
but sometimes we survive by forgetting.

42
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,880
You lost your mother in a tragic fire.

43
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,360
Your life was changed forever by,
what, a broken fuel valve?

44
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,720
Maybe it's not
such a bad thing to forget.

45
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,680
- But what about the dream?
- It's a dream.

46
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,680
You'll figure it out, or you won't.
That's how it all works.

47
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,720
It's a process, Anna.

48
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,120
What's it been? Ten months?
And you're almost finished.

49
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,360
But you're not gonna get there
in a place like this.

50
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,480
- Do you think I'm ready to leave?
- What else do you want from me?

51
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,960
Go home. Kiss a boy, get into trouble.

52
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
Finish what you started.

53
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Hi.

54
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,440
One minute.

55
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,240
Pretty little Anna.
Going home, sweet home.

56
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,760
I'll be Lonely.

57
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
I really gotta go.

58
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,840
There was so much blood,
wasn't there, Anna?

59
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,760
Do you really think they fixed you?

60
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,320
Come on, honey.
Let the girl pack her things.

61
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,680
What have we told you about
wandering in here all the time?

62
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,480
They couldn't fix me.

63
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,760
Who will I tell my stories to?

64
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,800
I've got a surprise for you.

65
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,680
- Look in the glove compartment.
- Tell me it's a cheeseburger.

66
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,120
Not quite.

67
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,920
- You finished it.
- Yeah. Look inside.

68
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,720
- Thank you, Dad.
- You're very welcome.

69
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,560
Is it any good?

70
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,440
Well, I don't know,
but I'm sure you'll tell me.

71
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,880
I know something that's good.

72
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,000
Oh, awesome. Thank you.

73
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,360
Yeah, Rachel made them.

74
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,960
She was gonna come today,
but I told her I wanted you all to myself.

75
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,920
She's been great, Anna.
Really, she has been.

76
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't know what I would've...

77
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,600
- Dad. You got me to yourself.
- ... done without her.

78
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,120
Alex?

79
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,120
Anna. You're back.

80
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,200
You're early. I'd hug you, but I...
Welcome home.

81
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,640
You look great. You look so skinny.

82
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,160
I think I could use some time
at that place.

83
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,880
My first order of business
is fattening her up.

84
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,840
I've already started with him.

85
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
Yeah, she's been cooking all day.

86
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:27,560
- Making... Oh, what are you making?
- Beef Stroganoff. Your favorite.

87
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,760
So, you have a house
full of women now, Mr. Writer.

88
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,200
- Did your dad tell you my idea?
- No.

89
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:37,760
About the party.

90
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,400
We thought we could throw you
a "Welcome Home, Anna" bash.

91
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,800
Yeah, okay. Maybe.

92
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,760
Well, everybody's
been asking about you.

93
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,800
- We've got all summer. There's no rush.
- No.

94
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,960
Okay, I'm gonna go down to the water.

95
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,440
I blew it.

96
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,840
Anna.

97
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,200
Just like it never happened, huh?

98
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,240
Alex. Oh, I missed you so much.

99
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,960
So, what do you think?

100
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,680
You know, he had them
working weekends

101
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,360
so it'd be finished
by the time you got back.

102
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,520
Welcome to your new ward.

103
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,760
Better food, crazier people.

104
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,520
- When did she move in?
- Guess.

105
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,200
First, she was helping
with the accident inquiry,

106
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,200
and then she was helping
with the funeral.

107
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,560
Now, she's helping him cope.
Three times a night.

108
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,760
Whatever.

109
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,320
Hey, thanks a lot, by the way.

110
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,680
For what?

111
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,880
- Deserting me.
- Alex!

112
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,520
You know, I was stuck here
with those two

113
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,720
while you went off
searching for your inner psycho.

114
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,440
Alex, you don't know
what it was like in there.

115
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,480
She was my mother, too.

116
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,280
You know, you could've at least
written me back.

117
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,480
What are you talking about?

118
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,520
The playlists I made you,
the letters I wrote.

119
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,080
I didn't get anything, Alex. I swear.

120
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
Maybe Dr. Silberling
didn't want me to see them.

121
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:08,200
No, it wasn't Dr. Silberling.

122
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,120
Oh, he's such an asshole!

123
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,240
I mean, how could you
not send my letters?

124
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,040
Those were my letters, Dad.

125
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,600
What? Were you too afraid I'd tell her
about your new little girlfriend?

126
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,400
Was that it?
Talk about all the dirty little secrets?

127
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,600
And it was a mistake for you
to move her in here,

128
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,960
and our whole stupid town
just loves talking about it.

129
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:35,120
You disgust me.

130
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,760
- Alex, where are you going?
- As if anybody cares.

131
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,800
You caught me.

132
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,920
Come here. You can hug me now.
I'm clean.

133
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:15,120
Listen, Anna, I know the rules state

134
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,920
that you're supposed to hate
Dad's new girlfriend,

135
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,240
but I'm really hoping that
we can be more original than that

136
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,120
and make this work.

137
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,280
- Sure.
- Yeah.

138
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,480
- Something's different.
- Oh, yeah, we painted.

139
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,880
I really love all the wallpaper
in the house,

140
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,600
but the kitchen just needed
some brightening up.

141
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,160
There used to be something here.

142
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,040
- Did there?
- Yeah, a chalkboard?

143
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,280
Oh, yeah, the chalkboard.

144
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:48,320
It must be up in the attic
with all the other old stuff.

145
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,200
I think I figured
we didn't need one anymore.

146
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,280
So, what do you think?
Do you wanna help set the table?

147
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,960
No, I'm okay.
I'm not really hungry anyway.

148
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,560
Alex?

149
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,160
What are you doing?

150
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,080
So, was that you or Nursie
in the throes of ecstasy?

151
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,520
- I don't know.
- Okay.

152
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,560
You drunk?

153
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
Well, I went to a party
and drinks were served.

154
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,800
- Where did you find that?
- Upstairs.

155
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,280
What the hell are you doing with it?

156
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:51,160
- I don't know. It was in the attic and...
- Okay. Well, that's where it should stay.

157
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,160
- I hate that bell.
- Why?

158
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,480
It reminds me of Mom.

159
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,200
We needed it, Alex.

160
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,240
That's how she'd call for help
after she got sick.

161
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,680
Anna, wake up. Rachel bought the bell.

162
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,360
What are you saying?

163
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,760
She went into a goddamn pet store,
bought a bell,

164
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,360
came home,
and tied it around Mom's wrist.

165
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,480
And do you know why?

166
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:21,760
So that she could hear Mom coming
while she was busy riding Dad.

167
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,720
- You're making that up.
- Okay. Why would I do that?

168
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,760
To get back at Dad.

169
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,880
Trust me, Anna,
I'm way past getting back at Dad.

170
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:36,840
You know, I might be drunk,
but at least I know what the truth is.

171
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,560
Oh, here comes the burrito.

172
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,080
Maybe try a sledgehammer next time.

173
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,800
- Sorry.
- Looks good to me.

174
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:06,840
Great, actually.
Just what our little kitchen needed.

175
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,040
Isn't it, though?

176
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,080
- I'm out of here.
- Cool.

177
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:16,880
You know, Anna, I remember when
I first came here to look after your mom.

178
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,360
I showed up at the house,

179
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,640
and Alex was doing
her bitchy teenager thing,

180
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,720
disrespecting your father.

181
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,080
But you were different.

182
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,080
Quiet, you know? Polite.
A proper little lady.

183
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,880
I remember thinking,

184
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,400
"Still waters run deep in this one.
She's the strong one. "

185
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,440
When I was your age,

186
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,240
I had to deal with some rough things,
like you, and I learned to be strong.

187
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,760
To be a girl nobody fucked with.

188
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,960
I am so glad to have you back.

189
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,920
I hope it works out so you can stay.

190
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:06,720
Thanks. I intend to.

191
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,360
Did you see her face?

192
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,760
It was like
you totally jacked her Barbie kitchen.

193
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,800
I was swinging the hammer
with my eyes closed.

194
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,920
That is so awesome.

195
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,880
It's our chalkboard. It should be there.

196
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,440
Remember Mom
would leave messages on it?

197
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,520
Soccer practices.

198
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,440
Oh, but her handwriting was so bad.

199
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,240
Pinkie pact?

200
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,560
Am I, like, really pale?

201
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,560
Yeah, you're pretty much,
like, see-through.

202
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,040
Well, hopefully your future husband
won't notice.

203
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,040
No, you are not leaving me here.

204
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,360
- What are sisters for?
- Alex, don't you dare!

205
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,680
- Hey, Matt.
- Hey.

206
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,520
- So how you been?
- Yeah. Okay.

207
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:24,000
You know, I really wanted to visit you
up there, but they wouldn't let me.

208
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,200
Well, you should've slit your wrists, too.
We could've been roommates.

209
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,480
She's back.

210
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,880
- So, listen, that night at the beach...
- No, no. Listen...

211
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,440
I was nervous, okay?
So I drank a bunch,

212
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,920
and no one has ever accused me
of being smart,

213
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,560
so I was dumb and drunk.

214
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,400
But I was worried about you.

215
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,600
I even went looking for you.

216
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,480
What do you mean?

217
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,240
I followed you home that night, Anna.

218
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,960
I was here. I saw everything.

219
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,960
Running a little late, aren't you, Matt?

220
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,040
- Thanks. That's all we need.
- Okay.

221
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,720
- I'll just... I'll see you around.
- Bye.

222
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,520
Why don't you bring these supplies
up to the generator room?

223
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,040
And then come up.
Your father's starved.

224
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,400
- Your agent called today.
- Really?

225
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,120
Yeah. I didn't know
he rents a house up here.

226
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
Yeah, the last five years.

227
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,320
He likes to pretend to fish.

228
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,080
I think he has the editor of
The Book Review as a houseguest.

229
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,720
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

230
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,040
So, I invited them for dinner
on Friday night.

231
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,400
- Really?
- Along with a few other people.

232
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,080
- Well, why not?
- Well...

233
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:38,520
We never have anyone to the house.
It'll be fun.

234
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,320
Please.

235
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,840
- Okay.
- Okay.

236
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,520
Murderer!

237
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,280
Anna?

238
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,600
What are you doing down here?

239
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,560
Hey. Are you okay?

240
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,200
It was Mom.

241
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,120
- What?
- I saw Mom!

242
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,280
What are you talking about?

243
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,600
Anna?

244
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,240
Anna!

245
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,080
She's been trying to tell me something.

246
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,960
- What?
- The fire wasn't an accident.

247
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,440
It was her.

248
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,400
Rachel just happened to
have the night off.

249
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,880
Yeah, right.

250
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:14,360
- Alex...
- No, it all makes sense now.

251
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:17,360
She left Mom,
parked her car down the street,

252
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,040
put on those little white shoes,

253
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,840
and walked back down
to the boathouse.

254
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,360
- Maybe we're jumping to conclusions.
- Excuse me,

255
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,760
I'm not the one that
saw our dead mother

256
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,720
point the finger
at Dad's creepy girlfriend.

257
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,600
Yeah, I think it was just a dream.

258
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,560
Anna, you were wide awake. I saw you.

259
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,600
Well, maybe it was all in my head.

260
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,040
Maybe so.

261
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
But it doesn't change
what both of us know.

262
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,240
That tap didn't leak. Rachel turned it on.

263
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:47,520
She killed Mom,
and she's not gonna get away with it.

264
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,600
Hello? Hello in there?

265
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,560
- Did she hear us?
- I don't know.

266
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,680
Listen, I'm going into town
to do some shopping for this party.

267
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,280
Would you like to come?

268
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,160
Have some retail therapy,
maybe grab lunch?

269
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,960
I'm totally hung over
and I'm expecting a headache later.

270
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,320
- But Anna wants to come.
- What? No.

271
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,200
What about Matt?
You could see him, talk to him.

272
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,680
I thought you said he came back
to the house that night.

273
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,480
- How about it, Anna?
- Come on.

274
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,640
You can go, and I can stay here
and dig through her stuff. Go on.

275
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,320
- You know, we can do it another time.
- No.

276
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,640
I'll be down in a minute.

277
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,760
I'm just gonna find
something cute to wear.

278
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,480
You little suck-up.

279
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,760
Your dad hates it when I drive fast.

280
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,360
- Our little secret, okay?
- Our little secret.

281
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,160
What happened to my mom's car?

282
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,840
Well, we discussed it,

283
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:54,200
and we just felt like
the family needed something more fun.

284
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,520
My one good piece ofjewelry.

285
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,320
Where'd you get it?

286
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,440
Oh, there.
Someone gave them to me ages ago.

287
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,320
A boyfriend?

288
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,400
An old patient, actually.

289
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,560
Really? Sounds like a nice job.

290
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,880
I wiped old people's asses
for a living, Anna.

291
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:45,000
And let me assure you, they were
not all beautiful like your mom.

292
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,160
No, I mostly had to do things
that decrepit old ladies

293
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,240
with lots of money were either too
ashamed or weak to do for themselves.

294
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,600
Wanna know how I got through it?

295
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,960
It's terrible,

296
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,280
but no matter how condescending
they were,

297
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,480
how badly they treated me,
how badly they smelled,

298
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,120
I always told myself,

299
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,040
"They'll be dead very, very soon. "

300
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,520
You know, Anna, we all have things
in our past that we're ashamed of.

301
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,680
I think sometimes
it's best to just let it go.

302
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,880
Anna?

303
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,280
Anna, are you all right?

304
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,120
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

305
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,120
We have some shopping to do, right?

306
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,320
Beautiful marbling.
How long has it been aged?

307
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,600
- We sell everything fresh.
- Never mind.

308
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:25,040
- I'm gonna go grab the milk.
- Great, thanks.

309
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,360
- Matt.
- Anna. Hey.

310
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,360
What are you doing here?

311
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:56,400
Listen, I think... I think I know what
you were trying to tell me yesterday.

312
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,000
The fire wasn't an accident, was it?

313
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,160
- What did you see?
- Matt?

314
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,680
Those berries aren't getting any fresher.

315
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,880
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I'm coming.

316
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:08,560
- Will you help us, please?
- Yeah, okay. Just not here.

317
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,400
Okay, then can we meet tonight?

318
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,480
Matt!

319
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,840
- Yeah. 11:00. At the rock.
- Okay.

320
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,680
- Couldn't find the milk?
- Yeah.

321
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,080
- We should go.
- Okay.

322
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:28,320
Oh, and, Matt, you won't need to
make deliveries to the house anymore.

323
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,800
That's gonna be my job from now on.

324
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,680
- Have fun?
- Oh, yeah.

325
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,600
Been telling each other
all our secrets, right, Anna?

326
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,840
Yeah. Thanks for lunch.

327
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,880
- Was everything okay?
- I lost her for a little bit.

328
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,000
I mean, I just hope
this wasn't all too soon.

329
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,440
Alex?

330
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,520
Jesus, you scared me.
I thought you were her.

331
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,840
- Did you talk to Matt?
- Yeah, we're meeting him tonight.

332
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,840
Cool. Look at this.

333
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,000
God, when are they bringing
in the stripper pole?

334
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:48,320
I know, she's like a crack whore
without the dignity.

335
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,520
P.S., look at this.

336
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
Come on. Look what I found.

337
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,840
- Meet Mr. Chubby.
- Oh, that's disgusting.

338
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,240
No, I'm not touching that.

339
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,320
Okay, that's enough
to tranquilize a horse.

340
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,840
Or you and me.

341
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,640
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait.

342
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,400
Party's over, Rach.

343
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,080
Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late.

344
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:22,240
Matt?

345
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,880
This doesn't feel right.

346
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,480
What if something's happened?

347
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:41,440
It's okay, Anna.
We'll find him tomorrow.

348
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,360
Yeah.

349
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,560
I'm gonna go to bed.

350
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,360
No, please stay with me till I fall asleep.

351
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,600
If I had 10 bucks
for every time I heard that.

352
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,960
Thank you.

353
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,280
No funny stuff.

354
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,760
Anna, hey. Hey, don't be afraid.

355
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,480
I just didn't want to
wake your parents up.

356
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,200
Matt. Where were you?

357
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,840
We waited for you at the rock,
just like you said.

358
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
Yeah, I know, I...

359
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,880
What happened? You're soaked.

360
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,880
You know, I fell and hurt my back
or something.

361
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,160
Well, here, come sit down.

362
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,840
I'm sorry it's so late, but... It's just...

363
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,760
I think you need to know the truth
about what I saw that night.

364
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,560
Tell me.

365
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,080
You're shivering.

366
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,880
I can't feel anything.

367
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,200
- I'm scared, Anna.
- Don't be.

368
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,880
Matt, what happened to your back?

369
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,440
Your mother tried to warn me, Anna,
but I didn't listen.

370
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,440
Hold me. Anna.

371
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,560
Anna.

372
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:06,960
Please, hold me. Anna, please.

373
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,080
Anna? Hi, I'm Sheriff Emery.
I don't know if you remember me.

374
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,560
Listen, we're gonna do
a thorough investigation,

375
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,800
but he must have hit a patch of timber,

376
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,400
fell out of the boat and broke his back.

377
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,920
Were you supposed to meet him?

378
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,560
Listen, we all know
what you're going through.

379
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,560
Anything you need, anything at all,
you come see me.

380
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,120
You understand?

381
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,960
I'm deeply sorry.

382
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:27,120
It's just terrible.

383
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:32,440
I'm gonna make breakfast.
You should eat something.

384
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,760
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

385
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,120
- Dad, wait.
- What?

386
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,520
Matt wasn't just in the water last night.
He was coming to see me.

387
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,560
Anna, what happened to Matt
is not your fault.

388
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,360
Dad, that's not what she's trying to say.

389
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,360
One of you come help me.

390
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,720
- Dad.
- I'll go.

391
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:59,640
- What?
- I saw Matt in town yesterday.

392
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:03,520
He told me he saw what happened
the night of the fire.

393
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,760
Rachel overheard us.

394
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,600
She didn't want me
to talk to him anymore.

395
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,160
She didn't want him
to come here ever again.

396
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,840
Anna, why would Rachel
say something like that?

397
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,200
It's just...

398
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,160
What?

399
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,640
Is everything all right out there?

400
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,480
- We'll be right in.
- Okay.

401
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,200
Sweetheart, I know
this is difficult for you.

402
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,520
It's been hard for all of us,
but, please, don't do this.

403
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,440
Okay? Just don't do this.

404
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,200
- Come on, have some breakfast.
- I'll be there in a minute.

405
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,000
You okay?

406
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,760
No, I'm not okay.

407
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,240
I'm not crazy, Alex.

408
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,960
Matt was here, and I thought
that I was dreaming, but I wasn't.

409
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,800
- Anna, do you wanna sit...
- And he said

410
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,480
that Mom was trying to warn him.

411
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,200
- Okay, how can that be?
- And he was holding me.

412
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:38,080
- Anna, listen.
- Look!

413
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,080
Oh, my God.

414
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,920
- Okay, now I'm afraid.
- I'm not crazy.

415
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,600
They're not gonna send me back there.

416
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:57,680
No, I'm not afraid for you.
I'm afraid for us.

417
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,120
Anna, we're the last ones

418
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,080
standing between Rachel
and what she really wants.

419
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,040
Come on. Look,

420
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:10,880
last time I checked, you didn't become
some psycho serial killer overnight,

421
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:14,960
so we need to find out exactly
who Miss Rachel Summers really is.

422
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:31,440
Yes, hi, I'm trying to
get some information

423
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:34,200
about someone we hired
through your agency.

424
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,680
Her name's Summers.
Rachel Summers.

425
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,880
Hello, I'd like to get a reference
on one of your nurses, please.

426
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,120
I believe she was on your staff
at the hospital

427
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:49,560
between July and December of 2005.

428
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,240
Hi, I'm running a background check

429
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,280
on someone who worked for you
several years ago.

430
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,640
Summers. S-U-M-M...
Yeah, as in "mother. "

431
00:46:01,720 --> 00:46:04,200
E- R- S, as in "Satan. "

432
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:09,200
What? No, that's impossible.

433
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,640
No, no, no, that's fine.

434
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,040
Okay, thanks very much. Bye.

435
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,160
We've got her.

436
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,080
Anna. Come in.

437
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:40,040
You know,
you have beautifully shaped lips.

438
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,920
You just don't know
what to do with them.

439
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,520
Men will go on about a woman's eyes,
but that's bullshit.

440
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:54,080
What they really want is
a girl with a pretty mouth.

441
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,000
There.

442
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,000
You seem very interested in these.

443
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:13,320
Would you like to wear them tonight?

444
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:18,240
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, come on. It'll be fun.

445
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,760
There.

446
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,920
What's your real name, Rachel?

447
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:30,520
What did you say?

448
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:35,840
The State Nursing Association
has no record of a Rachel Summers.

449
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,840
Your social security number's
for someone named Rachel Summers,

450
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,800
but she's a school teacher
from New Orleans.

451
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,800
She died five years ago.

452
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,200
So, who are you, really?

453
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,040
You know what, Anna?

454
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:03,440
I don't think this is going to work out.

455
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,560
Where do you think you're going?

456
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,600
To talk to my father.

457
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,800
Well, there's really no need.

458
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:22,440
We've already discussed it
with Dr. Silberling.

459
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,120
- Discussed what?
- Well, your behavior.

460
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:31,720
Anna, he's very concerned.

461
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:37,320
He's beginning to think that
it was a mistake letting you out.

462
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,000
You won't take this away from me.
I won't allow it.

463
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:48,200
Now, get out. I have guests coming.

464
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,000
I can't believe she sold you out to Dad.

465
00:49:00,080 --> 00:49:03,680
Maybe she can threaten you,
but what can they do to me?

466
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,840
- I'm gonna talk to Dad.
- No.

467
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:07,520
All she's gonna do is convince him

468
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,240
that we're lying
and that it's my fault, okay?

469
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:12,920
We just have to get through tonight,
and then tomorrow we go to the police

470
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:15,080
and tell them what's going on.

471
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,520
You're only gonna make it worse for me.

472
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:24,160
Fine. But this is gonna
take a lot of alcohol.

473
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,280
Hey. Look at you.

474
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,480
- What?
- You look terrific.

475
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,960
Thanks.

476
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,680
Well, I guess
you've grown up on me, haven't you?

477
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:50,400
Hey, if it's any consolation,
this is all pretty weird for me, too.

478
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,000
Book launch parties.

479
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:53,400
Might as well give everyone
a green light

480
00:49:53,480 --> 00:49:56,080
to come into your house and judge you.

481
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:04,200
Can I ask you a favor?
Would you give Rachel a hand tonight?

482
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,520
The truth is, I don't think
she feels good enough for all of this,

483
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,760
and people here are judging her, too.

484
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,560
Sure.

485
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,040
What?

486
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,720
I just wanted to know
if you needed any help.

487
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,760
Really?

488
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,960
Sure. Open the oven.

489
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:40,760
Okay.

490
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:48,360
The key to a good roast is to
let it sit 10 minutes before carving.

491
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,600
It lets the blood flow back in.

492
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:56,080
Back to the fray.

493
00:50:57,120 --> 00:50:59,440
Take out the garbage, will you?

494
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:23,040
You're next.

495
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,400
No. No. What did you do?
What did you do?

496
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,360
What are you trying to do to me?

497
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,640
What happened?

498
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:43,480
You leave her alone.

499
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,880
Just go to bed.

500
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:01,600
No, no. Listen, I'll be in New York
tomorrow and we can sort this all out.

501
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,800
Sorry about this. Travel safe.

502
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,320
Dad? Can I talk to you?

503
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,680
Tonight. There's a reason for
what happened.

504
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:34,080
It's Rachel.
She's not who you think she is.

505
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,040
Enough, Anna.

506
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,280
- What has she done this time?
- She's lied to you.

507
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,720
- About what?
- About everything. About her name.

508
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,080
Do you even know where she's from?

509
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,240
I'm not gonna dignify that
with an answer.

510
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,680
No, of course you're not, because
you only see what you wanna see.

511
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:51,440
All she is trying to do
is make this family work.

512
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,200
She's not trying to make it work.

513
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,520
- She wants you for herself.
- That is ridiculous.

514
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,280
God, if Mom could see you now,

515
00:53:57,360 --> 00:54:00,720
siding with that bitch
who's trying to tear us apart!

516
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:07,480
Rachel isn't the one
who's tearing us apart.

517
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,960
Look, maybe we should talk
to Dr. Silberling about this.

518
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,680
Right, because I'm the one who's crazy.

519
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:17,840
- I didn't say that. You know I did...
- Dad.

520
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,720
You're not wearing your ring.

521
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,960
Are you gonna marry her?

522
00:54:36,920 --> 00:54:39,880
- Tell me!
- Yes, Anna.

523
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,360
We're getting married
sometime this fall.

524
00:54:47,800 --> 00:54:50,720
We talked about going away,
but I wanna have the wedding here,

525
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,280
for all of us.

526
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:57,680
I'm not ashamed, Anna.
I'm not ashamed to be happy again.

527
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,320
Bye, Daddy.

528
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,440
We shouldn't be late for Matt's service.
Wear something decent.

529
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,440
I wanna look like a family.

530
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:45,600
"In the Lord, I take refuge.

531
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,320
"How can you say to me,
'Flee like a bird to the mountains.

destroyed, what can the upright do? '

535

The Lord's throne is in heaven.

536
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,640
"God's eyes keep careful watch. "

537
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:24,920

"The Lord is my life's refuge.
Of whom am I afraid?

themselves stumble and fall. "

541
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:00,040
This is from April 11, 1996.

542
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:02,680
"Police have recovered the bodies
of three children

543

Wright children's nanny since August. "

549
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,200
- Mildred Kemp?
- Holy shit. Listen to this.

550
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,960
"According to sources
close to the family,

"Despite police efforts,
Kemp remains at large. "

554

Wait, what...

555
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:44,560
Look. Look what she's wearing.

556
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:48,720
The pearls.

557
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,960
Rachel said they were a gift
from an old patient.

558
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:56,080
She put them around my neck.
Like... Like she was proud of them.

559
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,240
Yeah, well, lucky for us,
now we have proof.

560
00:59:01,120 --> 00:59:04,040
Yeah, if we can get our hands on them.

561
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,560
Don't worry about that.
This ends tonight.

562
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,120
Shit.

563
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:48,600
Hey, look.

564
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,640
- Alex, where are you going?
- Just go downstairs and get her keys.

565
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:05,840
- What are you gonna do?
- Just get her keys.

566
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,480
What are you looking for, Anna?

567
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:15,920
Is it these? Are you looking for these?

568
01:01:19,120 --> 01:01:20,840
You should take them.

569
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:23,960
Please. They mean nothing to me.

570
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,640
We know, Rachel.

571
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:31,200
We know everything.

572
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:35,800
You caught me.

573
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,240
Here.

574
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:49,080
Alex!

575
01:02:15,080 --> 01:02:16,120
Anna.

576
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:19,640
I don't want to hurt you.

577
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,480
This isn't how I wanted it.

578
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:26,800
You can make this easy.

579
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,680
- Anna.
- Alex.

580
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:45,720
- What happened?
- She drugged me. She drugged me.

581
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:47,360
Anna? Open the door.

582
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:49,760
Anna, listen to me.

583
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:53,400
- You have to get that necklace.
- I did. I got it.

584
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,360
Anna! Open this goddamn door!

585
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,400
You gotta go to Emery, okay?

586
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:06,200
- No. No.
- Yes. He'll believe you.

587
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,400
- Anna!
- I can't leave you here.

588

Pinkie pact.

589
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:13,320
Anna!

590
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:16,520
- Okay.
- Okay.

591
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,880
I love you.

592
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,680
I'll come back for you, okay? I promise.

593
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,160
Anna!

594
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:16,640
So, you're alleging that
Miss Summers is actually a woman

595
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:18,120
- named Mildred Kemp?
- Yes.

596
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:20,800
And she was the one responsible
for the fire?

597
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,400
That's right. It wasn't an accident.

598
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:25,520
She murdered our mother,
and now she's after us.

599
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:31,840
- Listen, I know how this sounds, but...
- No. Mildred Kemp. I remember her.

600
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,800
Out west in Woolridge County,
years ago, wife died,

601
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:39,520
man hired some nanny
who killed all the children.

602
01:04:39,600 --> 01:04:41,640
That's right, but they never caught her.

603
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:46,040
Okay, listen, Mrs. Wright
had a pearl necklace, three strands.

604
01:04:46,120 --> 01:04:48,440
There are pictures of it
on the Internet if you wanna see.

605
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:49,960
And?

606
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,760
Rachel is Mildred Kemp.

607
01:04:56,840 --> 01:04:59,360
Okay? She's trying to kill us
and marry our father,

608
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:01,360
just like she did to them.

609
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,880
Listen, I want you to sit tight.

610
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,000
Jerry is right outside that door.

611
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:12,840
I'm gonna pull up Miss Summers
on the system.

612
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:15,600
No, there's no time for that.
You have to go to my house.

613
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:19,840
Alex is still there, and I'm afraid
something's gonna happen to her.

614
01:05:19,920 --> 01:05:23,360
Nothing's gonna happen
to anybody, Anna. You wait here.

615
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,640
Mom?

616
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:24,320
Don't be afraid. I'm a nurse.

617
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,280
No! No! Don't believe her! No! No!
Please! Don't believe her!

618
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:32,240
No! She's lying!
Don't believe her, please!

619
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:37,560
No! No! Don't believe her! No! She...

620
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:48,280
There we go. Thank you.

621
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,640

01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,800
"Forensics reveal the children
were heavily sedated

628
01:07:25,880 --> 01:07:28,480
"before being stabbed repeatedly.

629
01:07:28,560 --> 01:07:31,440
"Despite police efforts,
Kemp remains at large. "

630
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,960
You're gonna sleep now.

631
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,640
You know, Anna, I'm never
gonna have children of my own.

632
01:07:59,760 --> 01:08:00,960
I can't.

633
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,800
Did I ever tell you that?

634
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:12,040
It's never stopped me from imagining
what it'd be like to have a daughter.

635
01:08:19,720 --> 01:08:22,240
But now you've taken that
away from me.

636
01:08:44,240 --> 01:08:45,440
Careful.

637
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:49,360
You don't want to hurt yourself.

638
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:01,240
Anna?

639
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,280
We tried everything, Anna.
This was the only way.

640
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:15,440
What did you do?

641
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:18,400
I had to, Anna. Didn't I?

642
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,000
Didn't I have to?

643
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:30,000
It's okay. It's okay.
I'm here. I'm always here.

644
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:37,240
Look at me. Look at me.

645
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:41,480
Be brave, okay? Okay.

646
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:46,720
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

647
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:50,360
It's Rachel, Dad. Rachel started the fire.

648
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,120
- What are you talking about?
- She killed Mom.

649
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:57,880
Dad, I know you never listen to me,
but you have to believe us!

650
01:11:57,960 --> 01:11:59,680
She waited until you were out of town,

651
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:02,440
and she drugged me,
and she drugged Alex.

652
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:05,880
- What?
- She was gonna kill us.

653
01:12:06,520 --> 01:12:09,040
Alex had to do it, Dad. She saved us.

654
01:12:10,080 --> 01:12:12,760
- Alex?
- Alex, tell him.

655
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:15,200
Anna, what are you saying?

656
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:18,640
He can't see it, Anna. He never will.

657
01:12:19,440 --> 01:12:21,440
Anna, you know what happened
to your sister.

658
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:23,520
- Tell him, Alex.
- Don't believe him.

659
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,640
- She died.
- No, don't believe him.

660
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,040
In the fire.

661
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,800
- It was a year ago.
- No! He's lying!

662
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:31,920
Alex is dead!

663
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,240
What have you done?

664
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,520
Alex?

665
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,440
Anna?

666
01:13:05,520 --> 01:13:07,520
Anna, what do you mean
the fire wasn't an accident?

667
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,320
What happened that night?
Tell me what happened that night!

668
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:16,000
Get away from me. Get away from me.

669
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:18,000
Get away from me!

670
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:35,400
Hello? Dad?

671
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:36,720
The guys, they want to
come back to our house.

672
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,280
It's not our house anymore.

673
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:43,040
What are you doing?

674
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,800
They can burn in hell.

675
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:47,120
Anna. Anna!

676
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:53,840
Anna, what's wrong?

677
01:14:56,480 --> 01:15:00,560
- Alex?
- Coming, Mom.

678
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,280
Alex!

679
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,360
I mean, how could you
not send my letters?

680
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,160
Those were my letters, Dad.

681
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:44,680
What? Were you too afraid I'd tell
her about your new little girlfriend?

682
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:48,400
Was that it?
Talk about all the dirty little secrets?

683
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:51,880
Anna?

684
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,960
Listen, I'm going into town.
You wanna come?

685
01:15:55,920 --> 01:15:58,360
I followed you home that night, Anna.

686
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,520
I saw everything.

687
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:02,720
Don't let go. Anna, hold me.

688
01:16:07,720 --> 01:16:12,960
You know, Anna, I'm never
gonna have children of my own.

689
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,800
I can't.

690
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:20,240
It's never stopped me from imagining
what it'd be like to have a daughter.

691
01:16:22,680 --> 01:16:25,200
But now you've taken that
away from me.

692
01:16:40,160 --> 01:16:41,880
I'm sorry, Mr. Ivers.

693
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:49,240
I noticed the name
on Miss Summer's passport

694
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:52,320
doesn't match the name
on her driver's license.

695
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:56,680
She changed her name three years ago.
Had a boyfriend used to beat her up.

696
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:01,960
Her real name is Rachel Worshinsky.

697
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,920
Your daughter got it
in her mind somehow

698
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:09,720
that your fiancée
was a woman named Mildred Kemp.

699
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:15,240
Why would she make all this up?

700
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:08,560
Hello, Anna.

701
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,360
Are you okay?

702
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,200
I did exactly what you asked.

703
01:18:17,520 --> 01:18:19,440
Did what, Anna?

704
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,960
I finished what I started.
