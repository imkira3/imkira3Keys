00:01:18,089 --> 00:01:22,158
<i>Get ready for the
feel, the feel of real. X1.</i>

4
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,729
<i>No pain, no gain.</i>

5
00:01:45,816 --> 00:01:47,218
Pizza, guys.

6
00:01:53,158 --> 00:01:54,360
Whoo-hoo!

7
00:02:08,807 --> 00:02:10,339
Hello, Wade.

8
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:12,075
Hello, Mrs. Gilmore.

9
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:14,712
What's the matter?
Life getting you down?

10
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:22,184
<i>I was born in 2027.</i>

11
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:25,787
<i>After the Corn Syrup Droughts,
after the Bandwidth Riots.</i>

12
00:02:25,789 --> 00:02:28,190
<i>After people stopped trying
to fix problems</i>

13
00:02:28,192 --> 00:02:30,428
<i>and just tried
to outlive them.</i>

14
00:02:36,867 --> 00:02:39,535
<i>My parents, they didn't make
it through those times,</i>

15
00:02:39,537 --> 00:02:43,505
<i>so I live here in Columbus,
Ohio, with my Aunt Alice.</i>

16
00:02:43,507 --> 00:02:48,845
<i>In 2045, Columbus is the
fastest-growing city on Earth.</i>

17
00:02:48,847 --> 00:02:52,117
<i>It's where Halliday and Morrow
started Gregarious Games.</i>

18
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:59,454
<i>These days,
reality is a bummer.</i>

19
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,423
<i>Everyone is looking
for a way to escape,</i>

20
00:03:01,425 --> 00:03:02,757
<i>and that's why Halliday...</i>

21
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:05,795
<i>That's why he was
such a hero to us.</i>

22
00:03:05,797 --> 00:03:09,300
<i>He showed us that we could go somewhere
without going anywhere at all.</i>

23
00:03:11,301 --> 00:03:12,869
<i>You don't need a destination</i>

24
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:14,803
<i>when you're running on
an omnidirectional treadmill</i>

25
00:03:14,805 --> 00:03:17,075
<i>with quadraphonic,
pressure-sensitive underlay.</i>

26
00:03:17,876 --> 00:03:20,476
<i>James Halliday saw the future.</i>

27
00:03:20,478 --> 00:03:22,210
<i>And then he built it.</i>

28
00:03:22,212 --> 00:03:24,380
<i>He gave us a place to go.</i>

29
00:03:24,382 --> 00:03:26,715
<i>A place called</i>

30
00:03:26,717 --> 00:03:28,086
<i>the OASIS.</i>

31
00:03:41,265 --> 00:03:43,666
<i>This is the OASIS.</i>

32
00:03:43,668 --> 00:03:47,773
<i>It's a place where the limits of
reality are your own imagination.</i>

33
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:03,322
<i>You can do anything...</i>

34
00:04:04,354 --> 00:04:05,357
<i>...go anywhere.</i>

35
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,658
<i>Like the vacation planet.</i>

36
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,459
<i>Surf a 50-foot monster wave
in Hawaii.</i>

37
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:14,363
<i>You can ski down the pyramids.</i>

38
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:16,265
<i>You can climb Mount Everest</i>

39
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:17,702
<i>with Batman.</i>

40
00:04:20,471 --> 00:04:23,906
<i>Check out this place. It's a
casino the size of a planet.</i>

41
00:04:23,908 --> 00:04:25,774
<i>You can lose your money there.</i>

42
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,976
<i>You can get married.
You can get divorced.</i>

43
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:31,813
<i>You can...
You can go in there.</i>

44
00:04:31,815 --> 00:04:34,916
<i>People come to the OASIS for
all the things they can do,</i>

45
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,222
<i>but they stay because of all
the things they can be.</i>

46
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:43,558
<i>Tall, beautiful, scary,
a different sex,</i>

47
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,796
<i>a different species,
live-action, cartoon.</i>

48
00:04:46,798 --> 00:04:49,397
<i>It's all your call.</i>

49
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:52,735
<i>Yeah, that's me.
Well, that's my avatar.</i>

50
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:56,705
<i>At least, until I feel
like changing it.</i>

51
00:04:56,707 --> 00:04:58,940
<i>Except for eating, sleeping,
and bathroom breaks,</i>

52
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:03,012
<i>whatever people wanna do,
they do it in the OASIS.</i>

53
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:06,015
<i>And since everyone is here, this
is where we meet each other.</i>

54
00:05:06,017 --> 00:05:07,550
<i>It's where we make friends.</i>

55
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:09,885
Locate Aech.

56
00:05:09,887 --> 00:05:11,956
<i>Locating Aech.</i>

57
00:05:15,026 --> 00:05:16,892
<i>Aech located.</i>

58
00:05:16,894 --> 00:05:20,395
<i>Sector 12. Planet Doom.</i>

59
00:05:20,397 --> 00:05:23,733
<i>Planet Doom, the most
dangerous place in the OASIS,</i>

60
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:26,836
<i>and a pretty great place
to pick up coin.</i>

61
00:05:26,838 --> 00:05:28,373
<i>Figures Aech would be there.</i>

62
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,510
<i>Aech is my best friend
in the OASIS.</i>

63
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:36,978
<i>He's my best friend, period.</i>

64
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,817
<i>Even though I've never actually
met him in the real world.</i>

65
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,055
<i>- What's up, Aech?</i>
- Hey, what up, Z?

66
00:05:46,057 --> 00:05:48,690
<i>Next race is in 20 minutes,
and I can't do the late one.</i>

67
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:50,392
<i>What the hell are you up to?</i>

68
00:05:50,394 --> 00:05:53,029
Man, gettin' my kills on, bro.

69
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:54,063
<i>Is that Daito?</i>

70
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,800
Daito and Sho.

71
00:06:02,072 --> 00:06:03,738
<i>This an artifact hunt?</i>

72
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,041
Yup. Gregarious 120.

73
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:10,613
<i>Turn into any giant robot
for two minutes. That's rad.</i>

74
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:11,917
<i>Artifacts.</i>

75
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:15,584
<i>Those were key.</i>

76
00:06:15,586 --> 00:06:17,753
<i>Halliday made sure
the OASIS was littered</i>

77
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:20,455
<i>with enough
randomly powerful stuff</i>

78
00:06:20,457 --> 00:06:24,827
<i>that anyone could win
if they had the skills.</i>

79
00:06:24,829 --> 00:06:27,663
<i>Death matches and artifact hunts
are a good way to coin-snatch,</i>

80
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:30,433
<i>but depending on your level
of armor, they're risky.</i>

81
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,070
<i>You see,
everyone starts the same,</i>

82
00:06:34,072 --> 00:06:35,738
<i>but the more coin you make...</i>

83
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,906
- Mom! Mom!
- <i>...the more you level up.</i>

84
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:39,808
<i>If you get killed, your avatar
can come back to life...</i>

85
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,110
Go get your dad!

86
00:06:41,112 --> 00:06:42,581
<i>...but you lose
all your stuff.</i>

87
00:06:44,581 --> 00:06:46,351
<i>Everything you've
ever worked for.</i>

88
00:06:47,084 --> 00:06:48,750
<i>All your money.</i>

89
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:52,120
<i>Your clothes.</i>

90
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,925
<i>Your weapons.</i>

91
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:58,527
<i>Since people spend most of
their time in the OASIS...</i>

92
00:07:01,365 --> 00:07:02,998
<i>...losing your shit means...</i>

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,834
<i>Well, losing your shit.</i>

94
00:07:08,005 --> 00:07:10,639
Aech, 10 minutes
until the race starts.

95
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,841
<i>Okay, Mom, I heard you.</i>

96
00:07:12,843 --> 00:07:16,978
<i>You see, the OASIS was the
brainchild of James Halliday.</i>

97
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:21,883
<i>He and his partner, Ogden Morrow,
released the first OASIS build in 2025.</i>

98
00:07:21,885 --> 00:07:26,154
<i>It was an instant success, and
it made them both very rich.</i>

99
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:29,791
<i>But Morrow was out of the picture
after a few years. And Halliday?</i>

100
00:07:29,793 --> 00:07:33,128
<i>He wasn't just the owner of
the world's biggest company.</i>

101
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,065
<i>He was like a god.
People loved him.</i>

102
00:07:37,067 --> 00:07:39,034
<i>They worshiped him
as much as his creation.</i>

103
00:07:39,036 --> 00:07:42,070
Maybe we should stop
talking about it

104
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:44,572
and start, uh, showing it.

105
00:07:44,574 --> 00:07:46,875
If you all wanna reach
under your seats,

106
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:49,010
you'll find that there's nothing there.

107
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:53,416
But we're gonna... we're each
gonna bring you one now.

108
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:57,553
<i>And then,
on January 7, 2040...</i>

109
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,392
<i>He died.</i>

110
00:08:04,428 --> 00:08:06,348
<i>And what he left behind</i>

111
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,567
<i>changed everything.</i>

112
00:08:22,113 --> 00:08:26,147
Hello. I am James Halliday.

113
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:29,784
If you're watching this,
I'm dead.

114
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:37,026
<i>Before I died, I created what we
in the biz call an "Easter egg."</i>

115
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:43,869
<i>A hidden object in a game that gives
special powers to whoever discovers it.</i>

116
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,936
<i>The first person
to find the egg</i>

117
00:08:47,938 --> 00:08:51,172
<i>I've hidden somewhere
inside the OASIS</i>

118
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:55,210
<i>will inherit my stock
in Gregarious Games,</i>

119
00:08:55,212 --> 00:08:59,080
<i>currently valued in excess
of half a million do...</i>

120
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:02,084
<i>Uh, half a trillion
dollars' worth,</i>

121
00:09:02,086 --> 00:09:08,556
<i>and total control
of the OASIS itself.</i>

122
00:09:08,558 --> 00:09:14,262
In the form of my avatar,
Anorak the All-Knowing,

123
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:17,932
I created three keys.

124
00:09:17,934 --> 00:09:21,378
Three hidden challenges
test for worthy traits

125
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,916
revealing three hidden keys
to three magic gates.

126
00:09:25,918 --> 00:09:30,086
And those with the skill
to survive these straits

127
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:34,892
will reach the end,
where the prize awaits.

128
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:37,397
Off you go, keys.

129
00:09:39,531 --> 00:09:44,534
The keys aren't just laying
around under a rock somewhere.

130
00:09:44,536 --> 00:09:47,470
I suppose you could say
they're invisible,

131
00:09:47,472 --> 00:09:51,207
hidden in a dark room
that's at the center of a maze

132
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:54,113
that's located somewhere

133
00:09:55,113 --> 00:09:57,547
up here.

134
00:09:57,549 --> 00:10:01,386
Let the hunt
for Halliday's Easter egg

135
00:10:02,254 --> 00:10:03,553
begin.

136
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:12,229
<i>The challenge
is to find three keys,</i>

137
00:10:12,231 --> 00:10:15,832
<i>but in five years, no one
has even gotten one key.</i>

138
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:18,835
<i>And the big scoreboard?
Still empty.</i>

139
00:10:18,837 --> 00:10:20,571
<i>Some long-forgotten gunter
cracked the first clue</i>

140
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,438
<i>and found the first challenge.</i>

141
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,341
<i>Then, this portal appeared.</i>

142
00:10:25,343 --> 00:10:28,804
<i>But the challenge to win the first
key was a race designed by Halliday</i>

143
00:10:28,806 --> 00:10:31,806
<i>that was so hard,
no one had ever finished it.</i>

144
00:10:31,808 --> 00:10:35,509
<i>The only ones still trying are the
gunters, as in "egg hunters,"</i>

145
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:39,080
<i>like me and Sho and Daito,
and my best friend, Aech.</i>

146
00:10:39,082 --> 00:10:42,684
<i>Oh, and of course, the Sixers.</i>

147
00:10:42,686 --> 00:10:43,852
<i>The Sixers work for IOI...</i>

148
00:10:43,854 --> 00:10:45,653
Sixers!

149
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,388
<i>...Innovative
Online Industries.</i>

150
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:48,857
<i>They're the second-largest
company in the world</i>

151
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,093
<i>with designs
on becoming the first.</i>

152
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:52,860
<i>Which is why they're putting
everything they got</i>

153
00:10:52,862 --> 00:10:54,396
<i>into winning
Halliday's contest.</i>

154
00:10:54,398 --> 00:10:56,033
Buckle up!

155
00:10:56,866 --> 00:10:59,100
Sit in!

156
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:01,770
<i>We call 'em "Sixers"
'cause that's the company rule.</i>

157
00:11:01,772 --> 00:11:04,839
<i>No name, just numbers.</i>

158
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:07,876
<i>They have a support team
made up of Halliday scholars.</i>

159
00:11:07,878 --> 00:11:10,579
<i>Like me, they spend all their
time studying pop culture</i>

160
00:11:10,581 --> 00:11:12,247
<i>that Halliday
was obsessed with,</i>

161
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:14,185
<i>trying to find clues
to solve the contest.</i>

162
00:11:16,854 --> 00:11:19,787
<i>They're just following
the orders of the head of IOI,</i>

163
00:11:19,789 --> 00:11:22,659
<i>this dickweed
named Nolan Sorrento.</i>

164
00:11:28,899 --> 00:11:30,531
How'd you get here before me?

165
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:32,767
Well, I didn't make a pit stop
at the hair salon.

166
00:11:32,769 --> 00:11:35,469
- What up, Z?
- What's up, Aech?

167
00:11:35,471 --> 00:11:36,771
Saved you a spot.

168
00:11:36,773 --> 00:11:38,139
Thanks, bro.

169
00:11:42,312 --> 00:11:43,878
I gotta go to the back.

170
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,547
Ugh. So you can skim coins
from crashed cars?

171
00:11:46,549 --> 00:11:49,316
- That's just sad, man.
- Fuel's low.

172
00:11:49,318 --> 00:11:52,921
Oh, but you still had enough to pay
for that <i>Something About Mary</i> hairdo.

173
00:12:34,364 --> 00:12:35,463
First to the key.

174
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:37,932
First to the egg!

175
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:29,187
Aech, are you seeing this?

176
00:13:31,989 --> 00:13:34,421
Yeah, I see it. That's
Kaneda's bike from <i>Akira.</i>

177
00:13:34,423 --> 00:13:36,657
It's a licensed skin
over a standard frame.

178
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,527
<i>No, not the bike.
Forget the bike.</i>

179
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:41,363
<i>The girl,
I think it's Art3mis.</i>

180
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:43,665
The Art3mis? The Sixer Fixer?

181
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:46,600
I've seen all her walk-throughs,
her Twitch streams.

182
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:48,505
It's her. It's definitely her.

183
00:15:35,644 --> 00:15:37,715
Go, go, go!
Get there! Come on!

184
00:15:43,553 --> 00:15:44,713
<i>You got it, you got it!</i>

185
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,499
Balls.

186
00:16:01,004 --> 00:16:02,005
She's not gonna make it.

187
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:06,840
Bail! Bail out!

188
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:07,844
Bail!

189
00:16:14,049 --> 00:16:15,685
Ow!

190
00:16:46,081 --> 00:16:47,781
Damn, I loved that bike.

191
00:16:47,783 --> 00:16:49,450
Oh, Aech could...

192
00:16:49,452 --> 00:16:51,688
Well, he's my friend,
but he could fix it for you.

193
00:16:59,095 --> 00:17:01,863
This is my workshop.
Touch nothing.

194
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:10,538
Where did you find
an Iron Giant?

195
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,207
Find it? I'm building it.
That's a commission.

196
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:16,176
Oh, yeah. Aech is
top-rated on the mod boards.

197
00:17:16,178 --> 00:17:19,214
People all over the OASIS
pay him serious coin.

198
00:17:19,216 --> 00:17:21,582
Oh, hey, check this out!

199
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:24,586
Hey. Z, yo.

200
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:27,054
- The <i>Galactica,</i> of course.
- These are my babies, all right, man?

201
00:17:27,056 --> 00:17:28,822
<i>Sulaco,</i> from <i>Aliens.</i>

202
00:17:28,824 --> 00:17:31,225
Dude, how are you
showing off my shit?

203
00:17:31,227 --> 00:17:32,993
<i>Valley Forge,</i> from <i>Silent Running.</i>
Oh, where's the Harkonnen Drop-Ship?

204
00:17:32,995 --> 00:17:35,562
That thing is sick.
Folds space like a boss.

205
00:17:35,564 --> 00:17:37,631
I mean, you can get from Incipio
to Arrakis in three seconds...

206
00:17:37,633 --> 00:17:39,199
Fingers!

207
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,835
You'll have to excuse him.

208
00:17:40,837 --> 00:17:42,971
He gets a little nervous
around pretty girls.

209
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,515
I can fix it in 10 minutes.

210
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:56,518
Yup. He's pretty great.

211
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,587
I assume you and Shoulder
Blades are clanned up.

212
00:17:59,589 --> 00:18:01,856
Oh, Aech? Nah.

213
00:18:01,858 --> 00:18:06,828
I mean, he's really good,
but I don't clan.

214
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:09,531
Oh, 'cause you're Parzival,

215
00:18:09,533 --> 00:18:12,099
as in the knight who found
the Holy Grail by himself.

216
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:14,101
What about you, Art3mis?

217
00:18:14,103 --> 00:18:17,040
Goddess of the hunt. Clans must
be killing to sign you up.

218
00:18:18,675 --> 00:18:20,641
- Favorite shooter?
- Excuse me?

219
00:18:20,643 --> 00:18:22,609
James Halliday's
favorite first-person shooter.

220
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,177
- What?
- Oh. <i>GoldenEye.</i>

221
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:26,548
- Playing as?
- Oddjob. Is this a test?

222
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,282
Favorite game variant?

223
00:18:28,284 --> 00:18:29,884
Game variant was "slappers
only." No weapons.

224
00:18:29,886 --> 00:18:31,552
I know what "slappers only" means.
Racer?

225
00:18:31,554 --> 00:18:33,855
<i>Turbo.</i> And his favorite food
was Hot Pockets.

226
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:35,822
Favorite restaurant
was Chuck E Cheese.

227
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,158
Song was <i>Video Killed the
Radio Star</i> by the Buggles.

228
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,060
Video was <i>Take on Me</i> by A-ha.

229
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:44,666
Oh, oh... His favorite
quote was from <i>Superman.</i>

230
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,634
"Some people
can read <i>War and Peace</i>

231
00:18:46,636 --> 00:18:48,836
"and come away thinking it's
a simple adventure story..."

232
00:18:48,838 --> 00:18:51,306
"Others can read the ingredients on
the back of a chewing-gum wrapper

233
00:18:51,308 --> 00:18:54,175
"and unlock the secrets
of the universe."

234
00:18:54,177 --> 00:18:56,810
Lex Luthor.

235
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:59,280
Cool.

236
00:18:59,282 --> 00:19:03,216
What would you do? If you won.
The whole contest, I mean.

237
00:19:03,218 --> 00:19:06,320
Oh! I mean, I've got tons
of plans in the real world.

238
00:19:06,322 --> 00:19:11,262
I'd... I'd move into a huge mansion,
buy a bunch of cool shit, not be poor.

239
00:19:12,329 --> 00:19:16,230
Now I know
why you stopped short.

240
00:19:16,232 --> 00:19:19,199
I stopped because of Kong. No
one ever makes it past Kong.

241
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:21,668
That... That's...
That's, like, a rule.

242
00:19:21,670 --> 00:19:25,005
Well, then you know it can't be true.
Because Halliday hated making rules.

243
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:26,741
I can't afford to zero out.

244
00:19:26,743 --> 00:19:28,342
- You're afraid to lose your shit.
- No, I'm not!

245
00:19:28,344 --> 00:19:30,110
What happens when IOI
offers you guaranteed coin

246
00:19:30,112 --> 00:19:31,311
for the keys to the kingdom?

247
00:19:31,313 --> 00:19:33,848
Nolan Sorrento
takes over the world.

248
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:38,185
A real gunter would risk everything
to save the OASIS from IOI.

249
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,686
Who said that?

250
00:19:39,688 --> 00:19:41,091
Me.

251
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,259
There you go. Good as new.

252
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:47,731
Thanks for the fix-up, my man.

253
00:19:57,273 --> 00:19:59,374
That's better.

254
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:03,347
I'll wave to you
from the finish line, McFly.

255
00:20:06,949 --> 00:20:08,249
That went well.

256
00:20:08,251 --> 00:20:10,150
Thanks to you,
Captain Big Mouth.

257
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:13,387
<i>Wade? Wade?
Where the hell are my gloves?</i>

258
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:15,359
Shit. I gotta go.

259
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,662
<i>X1.</i>

260
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:23,431
When I'm after gold on Planet Doom,
I need every edge I can get.

261
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:27,368
Every push, punch, gunshot,
you feel it all.

262
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:31,906
<i>Get ready for the
feel, the feel of real. X1.</i>

263
00:20:31,908 --> 00:20:34,242
<i>The X1 is like
wearing a second skin.</i>

264
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:36,179
<i>A skin that kicks ass.</i>

265
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:40,848
I zeroed out 'cause
of your broke-ass gloves.

266
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:42,282
Who told you to use them?

267
00:20:42,284 --> 00:20:44,354
You took hers.

268
00:20:45,455 --> 00:20:47,454
So you lost a death match.

269
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:51,358
Why don't you just respawn and
level up like everyone else?

270
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,327
You don't get it.

271
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:55,762
I bought all these power-ups for
this challenge, and I lost it all.

272
00:20:55,764 --> 00:20:57,432
That artifact
was gonna pay for the house!

273
00:20:57,434 --> 00:20:59,300
Wait.

274
00:20:59,302 --> 00:21:03,303
How much of our house money
did you spend on upgrades?

275
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:06,174
Well, all of it,
but I was gonna win.

276
00:21:06,176 --> 00:21:09,045
That was our ticket
out of here.

277
00:21:11,481 --> 00:21:13,214
You idiot.

278
00:21:13,216 --> 00:21:15,215
No, but I only lost 'cause
of the bad gloves.

279
00:21:15,217 --> 00:21:16,983
Our house! Our goddamn house!

280
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:18,485
My boys
were in that challenge.

281
00:21:18,487 --> 00:21:20,987
You couldn't have beat them
in a bootsuit, you noob.

282
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:24,157
Stop! No! No!

283
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:25,460
Alice, call the police!

284
00:21:25,462 --> 00:21:27,128
No, we are not
calling the cops.

285
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,995
Go to your room, Rick.

286
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:31,331
Aw, come on, Alice.

287
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:35,336
Why do you put up with this guy?
He's a shitshow.

288
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:39,906
I ought to kick the both of you out.
I swear to G-O-D, Wade Watts,

289
00:21:39,908 --> 00:21:42,476
if I catch you
touching my stuff again,

290
00:21:42,478 --> 00:21:45,215
not joking... Out.

291
00:21:52,155 --> 00:21:54,489
<i>"Wade Watts."</i>

292
00:21:54,491 --> 00:21:56,256
<i>My dad picked that name</i>

293
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,493
<i>because it sounded
like a superhero's alter ego,</i>

294
00:21:58,495 --> 00:22:02,163
<i>like Peter Parker
or Bruce Banner.</i>

295
00:22:02,165 --> 00:22:04,232
<i>But he died when I was a kid.</i>

296
00:22:04,234 --> 00:22:07,435
<i>My mom, too,
and I ended up here,</i>

297
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:09,337
<i>living with Aunt Alice</i>

298
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:11,708
<i>and her endless string
of hard-loving losers.</i>

299
00:22:14,377 --> 00:22:17,445
<i>"Halliday hated making rules."</i>

300
00:22:17,447 --> 00:22:20,050
<i>Why is that line
sticking in my head?</i>

301
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:25,953
<i>Maybe it's 'cause Art3mis
said it, and she's hot.</i>

302
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:28,222
<i>Maybe it's because
she called me out,</i>

303
00:22:28,224 --> 00:22:31,391
<i>sitting here
in my tiny corner of nowhere,</i>

304
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:34,128
<i>protecting my small slice
of nothing.</i>

305
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:36,397
<i>Or maybe...</i>

306
00:22:36,399 --> 00:22:38,899
<i>Maybe it's because
that line means something</i>

307
00:22:38,901 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>and I missed it.</i>

308
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:44,972
<i>The day the contest
was announced,</i>

309
00:22:44,974 --> 00:22:47,308
<i>the Halliday Journals
appeared.</i>

310
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,477
<i>He told us to look in his brain.
This was the next best thing.</i>

311
00:22:50,479 --> 00:22:53,981
<i>At first, it was jammed with
gunters looking for answers.</i>

312
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:56,416
<i>Now, the once-crowded halls
of Halliday's memories</i>

313
00:22:56,418 --> 00:22:57,885
<i>are left to people like me.</i>

314
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:00,454
Parzival. Oh, joy!

315
00:23:00,456 --> 00:23:04,157
And how will you eat up
my valuable search time today?

316
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,327
Gregarious Games, 2029...
Office party.

317
00:23:06,329 --> 00:23:09,496
Office party. Yes, you've only
seen it a thousand times.

318
00:23:09,498 --> 00:23:12,265
Why not go back?

319
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,970
Each entry into Halliday's
Journals is meticulously assembled

320
00:23:15,972 --> 00:23:18,472
from personal photographs,
home video recordings,

321
00:23:18,474 --> 00:23:20,407
surveillance, and nanny cams.

322
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:24,244
All rendered into a three-dimensional
virtual experience.

323
00:23:24,246 --> 00:23:27,915
Also, Halliday archived every film,
game, book, and television program

324
00:23:27,917 --> 00:23:31,252
he ever saw,
located on the mezzanine.

325
00:23:31,254 --> 00:23:34,621
No weapons or mature-themed avatars
are permitted within the Journals.

326
00:23:34,623 --> 00:23:38,626
Please enjoy your time with
us, and happy gunting!

327
00:23:38,628 --> 00:23:40,461
I like cleaning up.

328
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:42,832
Okay, Jim,
I'm, uh... I'm going.

329
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:50,570
Everything changes, Jim.
Everything evolves.

330
00:23:50,572 --> 00:23:54,140
Some things are perfect
just the way they are. <i>Asteroids.</i>

331
00:23:54,142 --> 00:23:58,148
People don't live inside
an <i>Asteroids</i> arcade cabinet.

332
00:23:59,514 --> 00:24:01,381
I know that.

333
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:03,618
Yeah, well, people are living
inside the arcade we built.

334
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,586
- I built.
- Uh, well...

335
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:08,489
Right. Well, I guess you
can say whatever you want.

336
00:24:08,491 --> 00:24:10,023
I don't really wanna
talk about it anymore.

337
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:11,192
No, of course
you don't wanna talk about it.

338
00:24:11,194 --> 00:24:12,627
You're forcing me out.

339
00:24:12,629 --> 00:24:14,160
Closer on Halliday.

340
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,030
Look, invention
comes with responsibilities

341
00:24:16,032 --> 00:24:18,198
you didn't ask for.

342
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,400
All right, if you make
something people want or need

343
00:24:20,402 --> 00:24:23,204
then it's up to you to set the limits.
You have to make some rules.

344
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:24,605
"I don't wanna
make any more rules."

345
00:24:24,607 --> 00:24:26,640
I don't wanna make
any more rules.

346
00:24:26,642 --> 00:24:28,074
"I'm a dreamer."

347
00:24:28,076 --> 00:24:29,377
I'm a dreamer.

348
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:32,312
- I build worlds.
- "I build worlds."

349
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:35,081
We created something beautiful,
Jim, but it's changed.

350
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:36,516
Okay? It's really
not a game anymore.

351
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:38,351
Are we finished?

352
00:24:38,353 --> 00:24:42,625
I liked how things were
when they were...

353
00:24:44,326 --> 00:24:46,493
When it was a game.

354
00:24:46,495 --> 00:24:49,262
And we're back to where we started.
But that's the point, isn't it?

355
00:24:49,264 --> 00:24:51,564
Things move forward
whether you like it or not.

356
00:24:51,566 --> 00:24:53,701
Yeah, we're finished.

357
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:55,539
Fine.

358
00:24:57,572 --> 00:25:01,544
Why can't we
go backwards, for once?

359
00:25:03,713 --> 00:25:08,115
Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.

360
00:25:08,117 --> 00:25:10,216
Really put the pedal to
the metal, you know?

361
00:25:10,218 --> 00:25:12,720
Go back 10 seconds!

362
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:17,558
Why can't we go backwards,
for once?

363
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,963
Backwards, really fast.
Fast as we can.

364
00:25:21,965 --> 00:25:24,501
Really put the pedal to
the metal, you know?

365
00:25:25,568 --> 00:25:27,568
Bill and Ted did it.

366
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,693
Back again so soon?

367
00:25:52,495 --> 00:25:54,630
Careful not to lose your shit.

368
00:25:58,735 --> 00:26:01,101
You figured something out.

369
00:26:01,103 --> 00:26:03,273
Parzival, tell me.

370
00:27:43,406 --> 00:27:48,242
Nice racing, Padawan.
You're the first to finish.

371
00:27:48,244 --> 00:27:52,716
Mr. Halliday... Anorak.

372
00:27:54,117 --> 00:27:55,683
It's such an honor.

373
00:27:55,685 --> 00:27:57,721
The honor is all mine.

374
00:28:08,864 --> 00:28:10,800
Get yourself a clue.

375
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,781
Who is this Parzival, and
how the hell is he winning?

376
00:28:28,783 --> 00:28:31,618
Well, here's a better question.
Who cares?

377
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,721
Halliday's contest
is vitally important.

378
00:28:33,723 --> 00:28:36,823
I mean, it's nothing less than a
war for control of the future.

379
00:28:36,825 --> 00:28:39,859
But this Parzival?
He's not even clanned up.

380
00:28:39,861 --> 00:28:43,397
He's alone. We have an army.

381
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,932
And yet,
he's got the first key.

382
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:46,800
Yeah, he has a key,

383
00:28:46,802 --> 00:28:49,802
but you have to get three
of 'em to win the contest.

384
00:28:49,804 --> 00:28:52,673
Our stock dove 6% yesterday.

385
00:28:52,675 --> 00:28:56,644
Loyalty division is reporting
profits of 28%. F'Nale.

386
00:28:56,646 --> 00:28:59,480
We're opening five new
loyalty centers this month.

387
00:28:59,482 --> 00:29:01,514
Debt Services dwarfs Hardware.

388
00:29:01,516 --> 00:29:03,583
Now, you really wanna talk
to me about stock prices?

389
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:05,618
The shareholders
won't be happy.

390
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:08,289
It's not our job to make them happy.
It's our job to make them money,

391
00:29:08,291 --> 00:29:12,329
but once we launch this little
baby, they're gonna flip.

392
00:29:13,662 --> 00:29:16,864
We call this Pure O2.

393
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,765
This is the first
of our planned upgrades.

394
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:21,368
Once we can roll back some of
Halliday's ad restrictions,

395
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,438
we estimate
we can sell up to 80%

396
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,843
of an individual's visual field before
inducing seizures, so picture this...

397
00:29:30,845 --> 00:29:33,849
All of this implies
we win the contest.

398
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,985
Indeed, it does.

399
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:43,557
Dude, you won the key
and 100,000 coins?

400
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:44,858
As soon as I took the key,

401
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:46,961
all the coins
just appeared in my account.

402
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:49,043
I'll tell you what, I'm
soiling my haptics right now.

403
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:54,702
What the hell's a Cataclyst?

404
00:29:54,704 --> 00:29:58,472
A bomb. Kills every avatar
on a planet, even the owner.

405
00:29:58,474 --> 00:29:59,706
Who'd want that?

406
00:29:59,708 --> 00:30:01,710
IOI.
They buy everything.

407
00:30:02,878 --> 00:30:05,878
Twenty-thou
for the holy hand grenade?

408
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,551
That's a steal!

409
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:13,721
Whoa! Zemeckis Cube!
I need one of those.

410
00:30:13,723 --> 00:30:15,392
Okay, don't spend
all your money.

411
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,363
X1 haptic bootsuit.

412
00:30:36,012 --> 00:30:37,414
Oh, yeah!

413
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:33,602
i-R0k, old friend.
How are you?

414
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:37,503
To be honest,
I have kind of a neck thing.

415
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:39,473
It's like a carpel-tunnel deal

416
00:31:39,475 --> 00:31:41,341
but with your neck,
if that's even a thing.

417
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:43,976
So if you could just stand
to... to your right.

418
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:44,980
My right, your left.

419
00:31:47,116 --> 00:31:50,420
Thanks, it's the repetitive stress.
Oh.

420
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,622
Here he is.

421
00:31:54,756 --> 00:31:59,760
The steampunk pirate king.
I knew him well, Sorrento.

422
00:31:59,762 --> 00:32:02,128
There are only three things
in this world I hate,

423
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,099
steampunk, pirates,
and tabbouleh.

424
00:32:06,101 --> 00:32:08,935
I mean,
why do they even have it?

425
00:32:08,937 --> 00:32:11,637
Is there a reason
we're meeting here?

426
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:16,877
Yes, Nolan. The Orb of Osuvox.

427
00:32:16,879 --> 00:32:19,983
You wanted it. He had it.
And so here it is.

428
00:32:24,018 --> 00:32:27,987
It creates an impenetrable magic
shield that can only be taken down

429
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:30,156
by a magic spell.

430
00:32:30,158 --> 00:32:32,792
The Orb of Osuvox.

431
00:32:32,794 --> 00:32:33,993
Don't say that again.

432
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:35,031
Okay.

433
00:32:37,466 --> 00:32:41,167
Now, I'm gonna need you
to keep this for now.

434
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:43,404
I'm gonna let you know
when I wanna use it.

435
00:32:43,406 --> 00:32:44,407
Okay?

436
00:32:47,877 --> 00:32:51,912
Right now, though,
I have another job for you.

437
00:32:51,914 --> 00:32:53,045
Ah.

438
00:32:53,047 --> 00:32:55,182
Parzival.

439
00:32:55,184 --> 00:32:58,088
Let me guess, you want
him off the scoreboard.

440
00:32:58,987 --> 00:33:00,486
Can you do that?

441
00:33:00,488 --> 00:33:03,022
Well, he's a superstar.

442
00:33:03,024 --> 00:33:04,891
He made it
through the first gate

443
00:33:04,893 --> 00:33:07,493
and avatars are gonna be
on him like hoes on Santa.

444
00:33:07,495 --> 00:33:10,731
i-R0k, how much more
do you want?

445
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:14,167
That's what I like about you, Nolan.
You never lick.

446
00:33:14,169 --> 00:33:16,203
You bite straight
to the chocolaty center

447
00:33:16,205 --> 00:33:18,539
of the Tootsie Pop.

448
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,941
Remember that old commercial,
with the owl?

449
00:33:20,943 --> 00:33:21,945
i-R0k.

450
00:33:23,946 --> 00:33:25,745
Three times my normal fee.

451
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:27,181
Done.

452
00:33:27,183 --> 00:33:29,049
Wait, really?
I should have asked for five.

453
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:30,986
Is four still on the table?

454
00:33:33,456 --> 00:33:36,456
<i>There's five of us
on the big board now.</i>

455
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:39,059
<i>Art3mis was next,
no surprise there.</i>

456
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:42,596
<i>She was on the track when I won.
She saw me going backwards.</i>

457
00:33:42,598 --> 00:33:47,634
<i>I gave Aech a tip, made him promise not
to say anything, and then he won next.</i>

458
00:33:47,636 --> 00:33:50,102
<i>I'm pretty sure
he bragged to our pal Daito,</i>

459
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:53,040
<i>'cause he won right after.</i>

460
00:33:53,042 --> 00:33:56,643
<i>And of course, Daito told
his best friend, Sho...</i>

461
00:33:56,645 --> 00:33:58,779
<i>He totally totaled his car,</i>

462
00:33:58,781 --> 00:34:00,884
<i>but then Sho got it, too.</i>

463
00:34:09,925 --> 00:34:12,158
"A creator who hates
his own creation.

464
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:16,662
"A hidden key, a leap not taken.
Retrace your steps, escape your past."

465
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:19,198
"A creator who hates
his own creation.

466
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,836
"A hidden key, a leap not taken.
Retrace your steps, escape your past.

467
00:34:23,838 --> 00:34:26,041
"And the key of jade
will be yours at last."

468
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,052
"Escape your past."

469
00:35:13,789 --> 00:35:16,693
What part of your past are you
trying to escape, Halliday?

470
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,336
- Hey, it's Parzival!
- Dude!

471
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:33,339
You're, like,
totally my hero!

472
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:34,307
Hey, Parzival!
Over here!

473
00:35:34,309 --> 00:35:36,642
Dude, you're amazing!

474
00:35:36,644 --> 00:35:38,925
Hey, Parzival! Right here!
Let me get an autograph!

475
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,352
Watch it!

476
00:35:46,354 --> 00:35:50,691
You're famous now! You can't
just go wherever you want!

477
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:52,091
No, no, no, I...

478
00:35:56,731 --> 00:35:58,834
Huh?

479
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,706
Ahh!

480
00:36:10,845 --> 00:36:15,048
That is... That is not funny.

481
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,718
Oh, God.

482
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,354
Ugh.

483
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:23,122
Oh, God. Don't you get it?

484
00:36:23,124 --> 00:36:25,626
You're "the Parzival" now.

485
00:36:25,628 --> 00:36:27,062
You have to have a disguise.

486
00:36:29,398 --> 00:36:30,966
Okay, here.

487
00:36:32,267 --> 00:36:33,966
Clark Kent glasses.

488
00:36:33,968 --> 00:36:36,204
They hide your identity
without changing your look.

489
00:36:44,979 --> 00:36:46,379
I'm not wearing that.

490
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:58,758
This is great.

491
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,827
The way your inventory
bursts out when you die.

492
00:37:00,829 --> 00:37:02,294
They didn't want
any more blood.

493
00:37:02,296 --> 00:37:04,131
This is right before
the OASIS went live.

494
00:37:04,133 --> 00:37:07,734
Six days prior.
December 2nd, 2025.

495
00:37:07,736 --> 00:37:09,769
Check this out.

496
00:37:09,771 --> 00:37:11,340
You know who that is?

497
00:37:13,008 --> 00:37:14,774
Is that Sorrento?

498
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:16,742
Sorrento started
as an intern.

499
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:19,178
He claims he learned
at the feet of the master.

500
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:21,914
That's how he convinced IOI
to create the Sixers for him,

501
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,283
his Halliday knowledge.

502
00:37:23,285 --> 00:37:25,785
But ask Ogden Morrow?

503
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:29,955
He says the only thing Sorrento
actually knew about Halliday

504
00:37:29,957 --> 00:37:31,425
was how he liked his coffee.

505
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:34,126
You could have, like,
different tiers of accounts,

506
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,762
like a gold member.

507
00:37:35,764 --> 00:37:39,432
A person could be
silver, platinum, bronze.

508
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:41,300
You know, depending on
what they paid.

509
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,370
You know, highest one maybe being
"Water" because "OASIS," right?

510
00:37:44,372 --> 00:37:46,305
Hell of a latte.

511
00:37:46,307 --> 00:37:48,374
Can you fast-forward to the
stuff about Halliday's date?

512
00:37:48,376 --> 00:37:50,145
What? Halliday actually went
on a date?

513
00:37:54,316 --> 00:37:55,981
So, what happened?

514
00:37:55,983 --> 00:37:59,218
Nothing. I invited her over.

515
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,854
Well, did you at least
get her name?

516
00:38:01,856 --> 00:38:05,358
Yeah. Kira, I told you, like the
character in <i>The Dark Crystal.</i>

517
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:07,329
That's her gamer tag.

518
00:38:09,465 --> 00:38:10,430
- Karen.
- Karen.

519
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:12,966
Yeah, okay? Karen Underwood.

520
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:16,368
No, no. Karen Underwood,
as in Ogden Morrow's wife?

521
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,370
Just watch.

522
00:38:18,372 --> 00:38:22,341
So, listen, you and Karen Underwood.
What'd you do?

523
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:24,810
She wanted to go dancing,

524
00:38:24,812 --> 00:38:27,082
so we watched a movie.

525
00:38:28,383 --> 00:38:29,383
And?

526
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:33,385
Where's the juice?

527
00:38:33,387 --> 00:38:35,388
Give me some juice!

528
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:38,992
- There is no juice!
- Oh, God!

529
00:38:38,994 --> 00:38:40,459
Hold the phone.

530
00:38:40,461 --> 00:38:44,765
Halliday went on a date
with Ogden Morrow's wife?

531
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:48,200
Just once, years before they
were even married, but yeah.

532
00:38:48,202 --> 00:38:50,370
And despite that,
and the fact that she died,

533
00:38:50,372 --> 00:38:53,874
the name "Kira" is only mentioned
once in all of Halliday's Journals.

534
00:38:53,876 --> 00:38:55,207
That's not possible.

535
00:38:55,209 --> 00:38:57,109
It is. Look it up.

536
00:38:57,111 --> 00:38:59,546
What we just saw is the only
time she's ever mentioned.

537
00:38:59,548 --> 00:39:01,046
It makes no sense.

538
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:03,416
She was an important part
of both their lives.

539
00:39:03,418 --> 00:39:05,287
I'll bet you anything.
All my coin.

540
00:39:07,189 --> 00:39:11,057
Search
"Karen Underwood Morrow."

541
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:14,227
<i>Kira, I told you, like the
character in</i> The Dark Crystal.

542
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:16,428
<i>That's her gamer tag.</i>

543
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,131
Halliday purposely removed every
mention of her except for this one.

544
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:20,566
That's weird. Why?

545
00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:22,568
It's like, it was just
so painful for him

546
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,905
to have to see her face
or hear her name.

547
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:27,573
Well, he loved her.

548
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:29,441
He couldn't tell that
to Morrow.

549
00:39:29,443 --> 00:39:31,310
Oh, that's sad. He should
have told her how he felt.

550
00:39:31,312 --> 00:39:32,812
Yeah, well,
he missed his chance.

551
00:39:32,814 --> 00:39:34,948
Look.

552
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:38,151
I found the clue to the race
in the other scene, but...

553
00:39:38,153 --> 00:39:39,553
I've always felt
that the biggest clue

554
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:41,421
to the contest
was hidden here.

555
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:43,325
You're right.

556
00:39:44,459 --> 00:39:46,459
I lose.

557
00:39:46,461 --> 00:39:48,260
Don't sweat it, Curator.

558
00:39:48,262 --> 00:39:50,564
You see, Kira is the Rosebud
at the center of his story.

559
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:51,964
She's the big mystery.

560
00:39:51,966 --> 00:39:54,269
No, no. A bet is a bet.

561
00:39:55,838 --> 00:39:58,905
Oh, wow. A quarter.
You can keep it.

562
00:39:58,907 --> 00:40:00,977
No. You can keep it.

563
00:40:04,345 --> 00:40:06,448
- You free Thursday?
- Who, me?

564
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:09,151
No, him.

565
00:40:10,419 --> 00:40:12,187
Oh, my God. Yes, you!

566
00:40:14,523 --> 00:40:16,289
You know The Distracted Globe?

567
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,327
Yeah, the dance club.

568
00:40:20,329 --> 00:40:23,162
Meet me there. 10:00 p.m.

569
00:40:23,164 --> 00:40:25,367
There's something
I wanna show you.

570
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,503
Uh, bye-bye!

571
00:40:28,637 --> 00:40:30,637
Did she just ask me out?

572
00:40:30,639 --> 00:40:32,504
And I was starting
to like her.

573
00:40:32,506 --> 00:40:34,341
All right.

574
00:40:34,343 --> 00:40:35,845
I don't do that.

575
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:41,548
Z, I can't believe
you told her about Kira.

576
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,117
What? I told you.

577
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:48,021
Hey, what about this?

578
00:40:48,023 --> 00:40:50,890
No. Have you considered that
Art3mis could be using you?

579
00:40:50,892 --> 00:40:55,361
Hey, dude, she's giving me a clue.
Maybe I'm the one using her.

580
00:40:55,363 --> 00:40:58,964
Should I go more <i>Thriller?</i>

581
00:40:58,966 --> 00:41:00,336
No.

582
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:02,234
Punk?

583
00:41:02,236 --> 00:41:03,238
No.

584
00:41:05,340 --> 00:41:06,506
Duran Duran.

585
00:41:06,508 --> 00:41:08,541
No.

586
00:41:08,543 --> 00:41:09,508
Does it look like
I'm trying too hard?

587
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,979
Yes! Listen to yourself!

588
00:41:12,981 --> 00:41:16,149
You have a massive cyber crush
on this girl.

589
00:41:16,151 --> 00:41:18,454
She's hacking your heart
to get to your head.

590
00:41:20,222 --> 00:41:22,024
I got it!

591
00:41:23,224 --> 00:41:25,258
- <i>Buckaroo Banzai?</i>
- Yeah!

592
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:28,528
Really? You're gonna wear the
outfit from your favorite movie?

593
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,696
Don't be that guy.

594
00:41:29,698 --> 00:41:31,932
I am that guy.

595
00:41:31,934 --> 00:41:33,700
Z, you gotta be more careful
about who you meet in the OASIS.

596
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:37,003
Aech, Art3mis gets me.
She'll get my outfit.

597
00:41:37,005 --> 00:41:40,006
There's just this connection.
I mean, sometimes, we even...

598
00:41:40,008 --> 00:41:41,707
- Finish each other's sentences?
- Yeah!

599
00:41:41,709 --> 00:41:44,611
We have that. Me and you.

600
00:41:44,613 --> 00:41:48,180
Yeah, I know, but that's because
we're best friends, dude.

601
00:41:48,182 --> 00:41:50,115
She could be a dude,
too, dude.

602
00:41:50,117 --> 00:41:51,283
Come on.

603
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:53,019
I'm serious!

604
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:55,588
She could actually be
a 300-pound dude

605
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:58,959
who lives in his mama's
basement in suburban Detroit.

606
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:00,596
And her name is Chuck.

607
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,131
Think about that.

608
00:42:34,329 --> 00:42:35,729
Whoa, dude,
is that Parzival?

609
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:37,463
- Parzival!
- Oh, my God, Parzival!

610
00:42:37,465 --> 00:42:40,734
Come here, man.
Hey, can we get a photo?

611
00:42:42,738 --> 00:42:45,071
- Thank you so much!
- Dude, you're my hero!

612
00:42:45,073 --> 00:42:46,341
Hey, Parzival.

613
00:42:48,642 --> 00:42:50,478
Thank you.

614
00:43:04,325 --> 00:43:07,426
Get out of town!
<i>Buckaroo Banzai?</i>

615
00:43:07,428 --> 00:43:09,763
- Huh?
- I like it. I like <i>Buckaroo Banzai.</i>

616
00:43:09,765 --> 00:43:11,430
- Oh, thanks!
- It's great!

617
00:43:11,432 --> 00:43:13,198
- Yeah! You look...
- Oh.

618
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:14,700
You look awesome!

619
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:15,702
- Thank you.
- Wow.

620
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,506
A big one, a small one?

621
00:43:19,508 --> 00:43:20,643
A big one!

622
00:43:35,689 --> 00:43:39,559
Get out of here.

623
00:43:39,561 --> 00:43:41,493
What a freak! WOMAN 2:
I thought he was kind of cute.

624
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:42,829
Have you been here before?

625
00:43:42,831 --> 00:43:44,731
It's cool, right? I mean...

626
00:43:44,733 --> 00:43:47,133
<i>So, what's the plan?</i>

627
00:43:47,135 --> 00:43:49,568
<i>Are you gonna kill their avatars?
Zero them out?</i>

628
00:43:49,570 --> 00:43:51,704
They're both here
at The Distracted Globe.

629
00:43:51,706 --> 00:43:54,173
I can't talk.

630
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:56,075
<i>The Distracted Globe
was one of the first clubs</i>

631
00:43:56,077 --> 00:43:57,343
<i>Halliday created in the OASIS.</i>

632
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:58,845
<i>That's common knowledge.</i>

633
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,180
But I double-checked

634
00:44:01,182 --> 00:44:03,649
and it turns out he started building it
right after that moment you showed me.

635
00:44:03,651 --> 00:44:04,716
The date with Kira.

636
00:44:04,718 --> 00:44:06,820
Right, and she was
a serious dancer.

637
00:44:06,822 --> 00:44:09,088
Maybe he thought
he'd take her here,

638
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:11,724
like on a virtual date.

639
00:44:11,726 --> 00:44:13,827
As if that ever works.

640
00:44:13,829 --> 00:44:15,327
So Halliday built it for her?

641
00:44:15,329 --> 00:44:16,662
But they never made it
past the first date.

642
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:18,097
So Halliday's the creator...

643
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:19,432
Who hates his own creation.

644
00:44:19,434 --> 00:44:20,834
And the club
is the thing he hates.

645
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:23,072
And "A hidden key,
a leap not taken"?

646
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:27,807
But people jump off it
all night long.

647
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:29,742
But none of those people
had the Copper Key,

648
00:44:29,744 --> 00:44:33,580
<i>so when we jump off,
maybe it's different. Right?</i>

649
00:44:33,582 --> 00:44:34,583
<i>Right.</i>

650
00:44:37,452 --> 00:44:38,718
So we take it together?

651
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,089
Sure.

652
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:44,224
We're not clanning up
or anything.

653
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:47,262
Of course not. I don't clan.

654
00:44:48,396 --> 00:44:49,562
Wait...

655
00:44:49,564 --> 00:44:50,666
Whoa!

656
00:44:52,267 --> 00:44:53,736
Ow! Whoa.

657
00:44:58,439 --> 00:45:02,242
I don't think this is it.
No scoreboard, no obstacles.

658
00:45:02,244 --> 00:45:04,680
- Maybe a dance challenge?
- Huh? Whoa!

659
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:22,331

My, Parzival,
you did come prepared.

676
00:46:28,896 --> 00:46:32,497
So, I've been thinking.

677
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,934
Maybe it'd be cool if we
met up in the real world.

678
00:46:34,936 --> 00:46:36,702
No, you'd be disappointed.

679
00:46:36,704 --> 00:46:39,338
No, I wouldn't. I like you.

680
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,573
You don't even know me.

681
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:43,408
This isn't
what I really look like.

682
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:47,412
This isn't my real body,
or my real face.

683
00:46:47,414 --> 00:46:48,948
I don't care.

684
00:46:48,950 --> 00:46:50,716
I wanna know your real name.

Well, Buckaroo blows it.
Shocking.

Are you crazy? You don't
tell anyone who you are.

691

You can't use your real name.

IOI, always in the way.

700
00:47:47,608 --> 00:47:49,441
Did you hear what I said?
I said I'm in love with you.

701
00:47:49,443 --> 00:47:50,812
No, you're not.

702
00:47:52,414 --> 00:47:54,046
You only know
what I want you to know.

Pull.

707
00:48:39,961 --> 00:48:42,961
Head back! Z!
Your armor is running low.

708
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,299
I just bought this.

709
00:48:52,374 --> 00:48:53,673
Zemeckis Cube.

710
00:48:53,675 --> 00:48:55,510

Wow, you were amazing.

713
00:49:15,562 --> 00:49:17,733
This isn't a game, Z.

714
00:49:19,066 --> 00:49:21,033
I'm doing this to stop IOI.

715
00:49:21,035 --> 00:49:23,535
I'm talking about
real-world consequences.

716
00:49:23,537 --> 00:49:25,138
People suffering.

717
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:27,006
- Actual life-and-death stuff.
- I know. I know...

718
00:49:27,008 --> 00:49:31,910
No, you don't know! My dad
died in a loyalty center.

719
00:49:31,912 --> 00:49:35,080
- He borrowed gear.
- He built up debt.

720
00:49:35,082 --> 00:49:38,584
He moved in with the promise of
working it off, but he never did.

721
00:49:38,586 --> 00:49:40,486
IOI just raised
his living expenses,

722
00:49:40,488 --> 00:49:42,053
then he got sick, and he
couldn't afford to get out.

723
00:49:42,055 --> 00:49:44,557
And then he died!

724
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:45,925
I'm so sorry, I didn't...

725
00:49:45,927 --> 00:49:48,026
No, you don't live
in the real world, Z.

726
00:49:48,028 --> 00:49:51,097
From what you've told me,
I don't think you ever have.

727
00:49:51,099 --> 00:49:54,700
You live inside this...
This illusion,

728
00:49:54,702 --> 00:49:56,705
and I can't afford
to let you distract me.

729
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:11,716
How the hell
did they get away?

730
00:50:11,718 --> 00:50:14,019
<i>Do you want the long version?
Your guys suck.</i>

731
00:50:14,021 --> 00:50:15,720
<i>They failed
to kill his avatar,</i>

732
00:50:15,722 --> 00:50:17,957
<i>which, if we're offering
constructive criticism,</i>

733
00:50:17,959 --> 00:50:20,792
<i>was a lame idea and only
would've slowed him down.</i>

734
00:50:20,794 --> 00:50:25,131
<i>Whereas my plan, which was cool
because I rock, actually worked.</i>

735
00:50:25,133 --> 00:50:26,899
He's still on the board.

736
00:50:26,901 --> 00:50:30,236
<i>I know that, Nolan.
But he won't be for long.</i>

737
00:50:30,238 --> 00:50:32,205
<i>I did a search

<i>who had recently bought

739
00:50:34,608 --> 00:50:37,809
<i>cross-referenced that with

<i>The real-world identity

<i>Voila.</i>

744
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:55,193
Are you loyal, Ms. Zandor?

745
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:57,162
You really want me
to answer that?

746
00:50:57,164 --> 00:50:58,731
Well, when you're at war,

747
00:50:58,733 --> 00:51:01,767
you need people
who are loyal to a fault.

748
00:51:01,769 --> 00:51:03,635
People you can count on
to get things done.

749
00:51:03,637 --> 00:51:06,104
I just get people arrested
for not paying their bills.

750
00:51:06,106 --> 00:51:09,242
Yeah, 'cause there are some problems
that require a physical solution,

751
00:51:09,244 --> 00:51:11,810
but there are other times,
particularly at war,

752
00:51:11,812 --> 00:51:13,513
when you need
a different set of rules.

753
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:15,146
- The rules of war.
- Exactly.

754
00:51:15,148 --> 00:51:17,950
It's too bad my division doesn't
operate inside the OASIS.

755
00:51:17,952 --> 00:51:20,852
Yeah, but if this war
remains in the OASIS,

756
00:51:20,854 --> 00:51:23,256
then you can't do anything.

757
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:26,191
So, this is one of those conversations
that we're not really having.

758
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:27,959
Well, we've had these kind
of conversations before,

759
00:51:27,961 --> 00:51:29,695
and look where you are now.

760
00:51:29,697 --> 00:51:31,997
You got a seat on the board,
head of your own division,

761
00:51:31,999 --> 00:51:35,667
a division that will cease to exist if
the wrong person wins this contest.

762
00:51:35,669 --> 00:51:39,004
F'Nale, a game decides
our fate.

763
00:51:39,006 --> 00:51:42,778
The only question is, how far
are we willing to go to win it?

764
00:51:44,979 --> 00:51:47,015
Tell me what you need, Nolan.

765
00:53:05,392 --> 00:53:06,894
Whoa.

766
00:53:10,731 --> 00:53:12,397
Where am I?

767
00:53:12,399 --> 00:53:14,635
IOI Plaza. You're a
hologram in the real world.

768
00:53:15,369 --> 00:53:17,236
That's a really cool rig.

769
00:53:17,238 --> 00:53:21,272
Thank you. It's a brand-new
Habashaw, OIR 9400.

770
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:23,274
It looks like
a giant hamster ball.

771
00:53:23,276 --> 00:53:28,046
You know, if you came to work
at IOI, you'd get one of these.

772
00:53:28,048 --> 00:53:29,981
I don't clan up.

773
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,218
You'd also get your own
penthouse apartment in Columbus

774
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,285
with the
highest-speed connection.

775
00:53:34,287 --> 00:53:39,892
In the OASIS, you'd get unlimited
weapons, magic items, ships.

776
00:53:39,894 --> 00:53:41,760
You want the ship
from <i>Defender?</i>

777
00:53:41,762 --> 00:53:44,296
You know, the kind that can
just jump into hyperspace?

778
00:53:44,298 --> 00:53:46,334
You want
the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>

779
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,767
You have that?

780
00:53:48,769 --> 00:53:51,403
Anything you need
to help you find that egg,

781
00:53:51,405 --> 00:53:52,907
and then there's the salary.

782
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:56,175
Four million a year.

783
00:53:56,177 --> 00:53:59,778
And if you do happen to find that
Easter egg, there's a bonus.

784
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:02,016
Twenty-five million dollars.

785
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:11,022
I can see you're using
emotion-suppressing software right now,

786
00:54:11,024 --> 00:54:13,861
and why wouldn't you? It's
smart, not to show your hand.

787
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:23,037
It is a lot of money.
I could really use it.

788
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:30,443
But I don't think you and I
would have the same plans.

789
00:54:30,445 --> 00:54:33,479
Well, I don't know about that.
What, for the OASIS?

790
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:36,418
I guess if you're not
a John Hughes fan...

791
00:54:37,785 --> 00:54:39,318
Of course I am.

792
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,153
Because the first thing
that I would do

793
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:45,890
is convert all the schools
on Ludus to replicas

794
00:54:45,892 --> 00:54:49,060
from <i>The Breakfast Club</i>
and <i>Ferris Bueller.</i>

795
00:54:49,062 --> 00:54:52,231
No way. That's a great idea.

796
00:54:52,233 --> 00:54:54,499
Which school,
Ridgemont or Faber?

797
00:54:54,501 --> 00:54:57,803
<i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High,</i>
not John Hughes.

798
00:54:57,805 --> 00:55:01,039
It's a trap. Faber College
from <i>Animal House.</i>

799
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,475
John Hughes didn't direct

800
00:55:02,477 --> 00:55:05,477
<i>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</i>
or <i>Animal House.</i>

801
00:55:05,479 --> 00:55:09,013
<i>Ferris Bueller</i> and <i>The Breakfast Club,</i>
they went to Shermer High School,

802
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:12,350
which is in Shermer, Illinois.
I know what you think.

803
00:55:12,352 --> 00:55:14,253
You think
I'm a corporate asshole,

804
00:55:14,255 --> 00:55:17,455
that I don't appreciate
pop culture, but...

805
00:55:17,457 --> 00:55:20,760
Man, that's not true. You know,
when I wanna blow off steam...

806
00:55:20,762 --> 00:55:24,530
Drink Tab, play <i>Robotron,</i>
listen to Duran Duran.

807
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:26,332
I crack open a Tab.

808
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:28,533
I put on some Duran Duran.
I play <i>Robotron.</i>

809
00:55:28,535 --> 00:55:30,870
That's why I love the OASIS.

810
00:55:30,872 --> 00:55:34,205
'Cause it's just full
of all these things, man,

811
00:55:34,207 --> 00:55:35,476
that people love. You know?

812
00:55:43,550 --> 00:55:46,050
I'm a businessman. I get it.

813
00:55:46,052 --> 00:55:48,854
But I gotta do my job.

814
00:55:48,856 --> 00:55:54,392
But I didn't ask you here just
to help us find the egg, Parzival.

815
00:55:54,394 --> 00:55:58,365
I asked you here
for what comes after.

816
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:01,235
What would Halliday say?

817
00:56:02,302 --> 00:56:04,972
James Halliday is dead.

818
00:56:06,273 --> 00:56:10,276
Yeah. He is.

819
00:56:10,278 --> 00:56:15,213
All that's left of him is this contest.
And you know what?

820
00:56:15,215 --> 00:56:17,582
It just seems like he
wouldn't want you winning it.

821
00:56:17,584 --> 00:56:19,584
A fanboy knows a hater,

822
00:56:19,586 --> 00:56:21,452
and I know you've got a whole
department of oologists in your ear.

823
00:56:21,454 --> 00:56:23,923
So, if you wanna know
what I really think...

824
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:25,392
I think you're full of shit.

825
00:56:30,564 --> 00:56:32,430
Here's my offer.

826
00:56:32,432 --> 00:56:33,932
Your board of directors,
you got them in the other ear?

827
00:56:33,934 --> 00:56:35,803
Why don't you tell 'em this.

828
00:56:37,003 --> 00:56:39,604
If they dump you,
I'll consider it.

829
00:56:39,606 --> 00:56:41,842
I might say something
off the record.

830
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:44,943
I had to make the offer.

831
00:56:44,945 --> 00:56:47,946
The board expected it, but I was
really hoping you'd say no.

832
00:56:47,948 --> 00:56:51,350
Because if anyone's gonna win
this competition, it's me.

833
00:56:51,352 --> 00:56:53,419
My avatar gets the egg

834
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:56,588
'cause I'm the only one here with
the balls to run this place.

835
00:56:56,590 --> 00:56:59,291
Wow, you really
switched gears there.

836
00:56:59,293 --> 00:57:02,361
From fairly reasonable
to maniacal overlord.

837
00:57:02,363 --> 00:57:05,363
You should be grateful, Wade.

838
00:57:05,365 --> 00:57:08,600
<i>You won't be around
to endure my maniacal reign.</i>

839
00:57:08,602 --> 00:57:10,602
Yeah, that's right.
I know who you are.

840
00:57:10,604 --> 00:57:15,640
Wade Owen Watts,
born August 12, 2027.

841
00:57:15,642 --> 00:57:19,644
I also know where you are.
Unit 56K, Columbus stacks.

842
00:57:19,646 --> 00:57:22,615
You were last seen entering
your trailer three days ago.

843
00:57:22,617 --> 00:57:24,048
You haven't left since.

844
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,383
What are you doing?
You can't...

845
00:57:25,385 --> 00:57:26,986
With all that's going on
in the world,

846
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:28,354
do you really think that
anyone's gonna give a damn

847
00:57:28,356 --> 00:57:29,888
about an explosion

848
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:32,457
in some ghetto trash
rat warren in Columbus?

849
00:57:32,459 --> 00:57:34,492
Sorrento, don't do this.
I'm not even there!

850
00:57:34,494 --> 00:57:36,530
Not for long.

851
00:57:40,233 --> 00:57:42,468
Call Alice.

852
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:44,139
Dial Alice.

853
00:58:10,664 --> 00:58:12,499
Pick up! Pick up! Alice!

854
00:58:17,604 --> 00:58:20,071
This bootsuit's pretty awesome.
Thanks for that.

855
00:58:20,073 --> 00:58:22,173
Rick! Rick, the place
is gonna blow!

856
00:58:22,175 --> 00:58:23,675
Rick, is that Wade?

857
00:58:23,677 --> 00:58:25,678
- Put Alice on!
- Let me talk to him.

858
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,680
Don't call here anymore,
you got me?

859
00:58:29,383 --> 00:58:32,120
I don't wanna hear your voice
ever again.

860
00:59:09,155 --> 00:59:13,559
Contact Aech, Daito,
Sho, and Art3mis.

861
00:59:13,561 --> 00:59:15,760
IOI came for me
in the real world.

862
00:59:15,762 --> 00:59:18,564
They gotta be coming after
you, so wherever you are...

863
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:46,658
Sorry about the blindfold.

864
00:59:46,660 --> 00:59:48,596
My guys are a little paranoid.

865
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:51,662
Say that again.

866
00:59:51,664 --> 00:59:54,201
My guys are a little paranoid.

867
00:59:55,336 --> 00:59:56,571
Art3mis?

868
00:59:58,338 --> 01:00:02,343
My real name is Samantha,
but yeah, I'm Art3mis.

869
01:00:04,278 --> 01:00:06,747
Showers are that way,
clean clothes, too.

870
01:00:10,283 --> 01:00:14,289
Welcome to the rebellion,
Wade.

871
01:00:25,499 --> 01:00:30,803
That's IOI.
So the stacks are over there?

872
01:00:30,805 --> 01:00:33,608
We've been living this close
to each other the whole time?

873
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:37,475
Next door,

874
01:00:37,477 --> 01:00:41,515
around the world, it's... it's
all the same in the OASIS.

875
01:00:43,818 --> 01:00:46,417
For the record,

876
01:00:46,419 --> 01:00:47,718
um...

877
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:51,722
I'm not disappointed.

878
01:00:51,724 --> 01:00:54,827
You said I... I would be
disappointed when I met you, but...

879
01:00:54,829 --> 01:00:58,263
I'm not.

880
01:00:58,265 --> 01:01:01,036
I've lived with it my whole life.
You don't have to pretend.

881
01:01:15,615 --> 01:01:18,352
You have a birthmark, so what?

882
01:01:19,285 --> 01:01:20,755
Why would that scare me?

883
01:01:28,229 --> 01:01:30,863
Z, if I hurt you,
I'm... I'm sorry.

884
01:01:30,865 --> 01:01:32,865
No, it's...

885
01:01:32,867 --> 01:01:36,367
Wait, did... did you
just call me "Z"?

886
01:01:36,369 --> 01:01:38,403
- Oh, my God. Did I?
- I think you did.

887
01:01:38,405 --> 01:01:40,271
Wade, I'm sorry.

888
01:01:40,273 --> 01:01:42,608
Yeah, Wade, Z.

889
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:45,910
You can call me whatever you want.
And I'll call you Sam.

890
01:01:45,912 --> 01:01:46,912
No.

891
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:49,548
Uh, Samantha?

892
01:01:49,550 --> 01:01:51,753
Okay. Cool.

893
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:00,794
Wow.

894
01:02:01,662 --> 01:02:03,731
It's so much slower here.

895
01:02:04,932 --> 01:02:08,436
I mean, the wind,
the people...

896
01:02:10,336 --> 01:02:12,139
Everything.

897
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:19,845
We forget what it's like
to be outside.

898
01:02:19,847 --> 01:02:20,849
Yeah.

899
01:02:24,184 --> 01:02:27,653
- Uh...
- Oh, shit!

900
01:02:27,655 --> 01:02:29,321
- I just figured it out.
- Figured what out?

901
01:02:29,323 --> 01:02:30,803
The second clue.
I know what it means.

902
01:02:36,896 --> 01:02:38,963
We've been thinking about it
too literally.

903
01:02:38,965 --> 01:02:40,698
"The leap not taken,"

904
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:42,934
the leap Halliday didn't take,
is with Kira.

905
01:02:42,936 --> 01:02:46,771
Yeah, but... I mean, he blamed her
for breaking up him and Morrow.

906
01:02:46,773 --> 01:02:49,707
No. Halliday was madly
in love with her.

907
01:02:49,709 --> 01:02:51,943
He had a chance with Kira. He had
a chance to kiss her, but...

908
01:02:51,945 --> 01:02:53,477
He didn't take the leap.

909
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:57,216
Right. So that's where
we go next.

910
01:02:57,218 --> 01:02:58,783
The place where the leap
wasn't taken.

911
01:02:58,785 --> 01:03:00,452
Where the date was.

912
01:03:00,454 --> 01:03:02,620
At the movies!

913
01:03:02,622 --> 01:03:04,388
Hey, Curator.

914
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,390
We figured out the second clue.
The challenge is here.

915
01:03:06,392 --> 01:03:08,459
Halliday kept track of every
movie he ever watched,

916
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:11,530
the week and the year he watched
it, and how many times.

917
01:03:11,532 --> 01:03:16,300
Curator, can we see
November 23 to 27, 2025?

918
01:03:16,302 --> 01:03:18,102
That's the week
he went on the date with Kira.

919
01:03:22,709 --> 01:03:26,345
Okay, so our options for that
week are <i>The Fly</i> remake.

920
01:03:26,347 --> 01:03:28,479
Great flick,
terrible date movie.

921
01:03:28,481 --> 01:03:31,984
<i>Say Anything...</i>
That would make sense.

922
01:03:31,986 --> 01:03:36,357
We gotta remember the clue. "A
creator who hates his own creation."

923
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:42,995
<i>The Shining!</i>

924
01:03:42,997 --> 01:03:45,263
It's Halliday's
11th favorite horror film,

925
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:47,666
and it's based on the best-selling
book by Stephen King,

926
01:03:47,668 --> 01:03:49,267
who hated the movie!

927
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:51,370
Hey! No side chitchat.

928
01:03:51,372 --> 01:03:52,674
I think we found it.

929
01:03:56,443 --> 01:03:58,977
Are you absolutely sure
you want to go here?

930
01:03:58,979 --> 01:04:01,046
Absolutely positive.

931
01:04:01,048 --> 01:04:03,881
Let's hope
you have the belly for it.

932
01:04:46,827 --> 01:04:47,928
Look.

933
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,595
Ticking clock.

934
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:54,334
Okay, so I'm estimating about

935
01:04:55,436 --> 01:04:57,468
five minutes to find the key.

936
01:04:57,470 --> 01:04:59,104
Yeah, there are so many keys
in <i>The Shining,</i> though.

937
01:04:59,106 --> 01:05:01,939
Where do we start?

938
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:05,343
I've never seen <i>The Shining.</i>
Is it really scary?

939
01:05:05,345 --> 01:05:09,080
Uh, I had to watch it
through my fingers.

940
01:05:09,082 --> 01:05:12,050
Okay, so we got the key
from room 237,

941
01:05:12,052 --> 01:05:13,952
the keys to the Snowcat,

942
01:05:13,954 --> 01:05:15,986
or the keys they give Jack
at the beginning of the movie.

943
01:05:15,988 --> 01:05:17,789
Well,
if it's "the leap not taken,"

944
01:05:17,791 --> 01:05:19,057
maybe the key
isn't a key at all.

945
01:05:19,059 --> 01:05:20,124
I know
where the Snowcat keys are!

946
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:21,526
I say we split up.

947
01:05:21,528 --> 01:05:22,993
We get all the keys

948
01:05:22,995 --> 01:05:24,955
and then we meet back
at the Torrances' apartment.

949
01:05:28,669 --> 01:05:30,305
Hello, Danny.

950
01:05:31,537 --> 01:05:33,138
Come play with us.

951
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:36,544
Little girls, y'all know
how to get out of here?

952
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:42,713
Wait, wait!

953
01:05:42,715 --> 01:05:44,850
Wait, where's Aech?

954
01:05:44,852 --> 01:05:45,920
Wait!

955
01:05:47,019 --> 01:05:48,021
Aech!

956
01:05:49,021 --> 01:05:50,057
No, no, no, no!

957
01:06:08,108 --> 01:06:09,910
Ahh!

958
01:06:14,648 --> 01:06:16,017
Ahh!

959
01:06:49,749 --> 01:06:52,617
Oh, uh, hi, naked lady.
I'm sorry.

960
01:06:52,619 --> 01:06:54,718
I didn't mean to interrupt,
uh, your bath time.

961
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,787
Uh, I know self-care
can be important.

962
01:06:56,789 --> 01:06:59,893
Uh, but can you do me a favor and
tell me, where are all the exits?

963
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:05,095
Huh. Whoa.

964
01:07:05,097 --> 01:07:07,466
Okay, am I being punked?

965
01:07:07,468 --> 01:07:09,803
'Cause you're likin' me
a little way too much.

966
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:13,474
All right, you know what?
I'ma go with it.

967
01:07:27,053 --> 01:07:28,088
Ahh!

968
01:08:05,224 --> 01:08:06,825
Time's running out.

969
01:08:06,827 --> 01:08:08,959
Yo, Z, is Art3mis
pissed at me?

970
01:08:08,961 --> 01:08:11,162
Dude, I'm pissed at you. You've
never seen <i>The Shining,</i> have you?

971
01:08:11,164 --> 01:08:12,763
You know I hate scary movies!

972
01:08:12,765 --> 01:08:13,932
We got the key.

973
01:08:13,934 --> 01:08:15,133
Sweet! To room 237!

974
01:08:15,135 --> 01:08:17,868
We ain't got no business
goin' to room 237!

975
01:08:17,870 --> 01:08:19,670
We should stay out!

976
01:08:19,672 --> 01:08:21,305
Plus, there was this crazy,
naked zombie lady in there.

977
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:23,008
There are no zombies
in <i>The Shining.</i>

978
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,975
Well, maybe it's not supposed
to be like the movie.

979
01:08:24,977 --> 01:08:26,678
Kira is the key.
You're the one who said it.

980
01:08:26,680 --> 01:08:28,880
Hey, y'all.
I saw a picture of Kira!

981
01:08:28,882 --> 01:08:30,952
Huh?

982
01:08:33,287 --> 01:08:34,521
Where?

983
01:08:41,328 --> 01:08:45,664
It's Kira.
"Escape your past."

984
01:08:45,666 --> 01:08:48,866
"The leap not taken."

985
01:08:48,868 --> 01:08:50,868
Halliday's greatest fear
wasn't <i>The Shining</i>

986
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:53,338
or any book or movie.

987
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:56,907
His biggest fear
was kissing a girl.

988
01:08:56,909 --> 01:09:00,277
That's the leap
he couldn't take.

989
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,056
The ballroom.

990
01:09:23,703 --> 01:09:25,773
Aech, come on.

991
01:09:29,376 --> 01:09:31,145
Zombies. Told you.

992
01:09:32,779 --> 01:09:34,015
That's her.

993
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:36,751
That's Kira.

994
01:09:39,619 --> 01:09:41,620
None of this
is in <i>The Shining.</i>

995
01:09:41,622 --> 01:09:43,888
Z, look. That's the zombie-circle
level in <i>Mayhem Mansion,</i>

996
01:09:43,890 --> 01:09:45,322
one of Halliday's first games.

997
01:09:45,324 --> 01:09:47,294
The whole <i>Shining</i> trivia
is just a diversion.

998
01:09:48,361 --> 01:09:50,131
One minute left.

999
01:09:51,398 --> 01:09:52,930
How do we get to her?

1000
01:09:52,932 --> 01:09:54,098
Take the leap.

1001
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,101
Wait!

1002
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:57,605
Whoa!

1003
01:10:03,275 --> 01:10:06,243
Okay, Mr. Dead Guy.
Cool if I lead?

1004
01:10:53,859 --> 01:10:56,161
Care to dance?

1005
01:10:56,163 --> 01:10:59,633
Do you know how long I've
been waiting for you to ask?

1006
01:11:05,305 --> 01:11:08,106
Well, well, well.

1007
01:11:08,108 --> 01:11:12,279
So you found my Jade Key.

1008
01:11:14,980 --> 01:11:16,883
Imagine that.

1009
01:11:21,887 --> 01:11:23,256
Thank you.

1010
01:11:28,227 --> 01:11:30,297
- Kira was a very beautiful...
- Go on.

1011
01:11:59,359 --> 01:12:02,426
One of our oologists saw them
enter the media library.

1012
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:04,094
She cracked the clue.

1013
01:12:04,096 --> 01:12:07,898
Now, we just have to win
<i>The Shining</i> challenge.

1014
01:12:10,236 --> 01:12:13,036
Get her off me!
Get her off me!

1015
01:12:22,449 --> 01:12:26,954
Mr. Sorrento, I really think
you need to see this.

1016
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:30,890
Now Parzival's
got the Jade Key.

1017
01:12:41,301 --> 01:12:43,500
He's alive.

1018
01:12:43,502 --> 01:12:46,437
I know. I'll get back to you.

1019
01:12:46,439 --> 01:12:48,441
I got what you're looking for.

1020
01:12:52,578 --> 01:12:56,783
Freeze. This guy.
The one with the lame tattoo.

1021
01:12:57,383 --> 01:12:58,551
Enlarge.

1022
01:13:01,087 --> 01:13:04,322
Run him through our database,
every IOI drone in Columbus.

1023
01:13:04,324 --> 01:13:05,760
Find him.

1024
01:13:32,484 --> 01:13:34,419
Groceries are here.

1025
01:13:34,421 --> 01:13:35,920
All right. Gluten-O's...

1026
01:13:35,922 --> 01:13:37,155
"If you know
the answer ultimate,

1027
01:13:37,157 --> 01:13:39,424
"divide it
by the number magic,

1028
01:13:39,426 --> 01:13:42,259
"and what you need, want, and desire
will be found in the fortress tragic."

1029
01:13:42,261 --> 01:13:44,362
"Tragic," that's gotta be
Halliday referring to himself.

1030
01:13:44,364 --> 01:13:45,463
Why?

1031
01:13:45,465 --> 01:13:47,264
Because he was lonely.

1032
01:13:47,266 --> 01:13:49,166
He had no one to spend his
life with towards the end.

1033
01:13:49,168 --> 01:13:51,268
Yeah, that's true.

1034
01:13:51,270 --> 01:13:53,204
The contest has gotta be somehow
about connecting with someone.

1035
01:13:53,206 --> 01:13:54,572
Anyone.

1036
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:56,273
He wants the person
who cares for the OASIS

1037
01:13:56,275 --> 01:13:57,975
to be connected
with the world.

1038
01:13:57,977 --> 01:14:00,447
That's what I think
he's trying to tell us.

1039
01:14:06,453 --> 01:14:08,055
Wade.

1040
01:14:10,123 --> 01:14:12,456
You understand Halliday.

1041
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:16,160
You know him
better than anyone.

1042
01:14:16,162 --> 01:14:19,162
It's exactly
why I think you'll win.

1043
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:22,970
Really? You really think
I'm gonna win?

1044
01:14:26,907 --> 01:14:28,441
Do not move!

1045
01:14:34,079 --> 01:14:35,515
Target identified!

1046
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,152
Freeze! Don't move!

1047
01:14:45,025 --> 01:14:47,658
- This leads right to the alley.
- You first.

1048
01:14:47,660 --> 01:14:49,329
I'm right behind you. Go now!

1049
01:14:50,931 --> 01:14:52,530
Come on!

1050
01:14:52,532 --> 01:14:55,032
- Wade, the OASIS needs you.
- What?

1051
01:14:55,034 --> 01:14:56,334
- I'm gonna delay them.
- Wait!

1052
01:14:56,336 --> 01:14:58,568
No, no, no, wait! No, no, no!

1053
01:14:58,570 --> 01:15:00,940
You'll forgive me
for this, I promise.

1054
01:15:10,182 --> 01:15:11,551
Freeze, freeze, freeze!

1055
01:15:12,584 --> 01:15:13,587
Don't move!

1056
01:15:19,092 --> 01:15:21,591
Samantha Evelyn Cook.

1057
01:15:21,593 --> 01:15:25,463
IOI has purchased and consolidated
all of your outstanding debt,

1058
01:15:25,465 --> 01:15:28,732
currently in excess
of 23,000 credits.

1059
01:15:28,734 --> 01:15:31,602
You will be remanded to the
nearest IOI loyalty center

1060
01:15:31,604 --> 01:15:33,103
until your debt
is paid in full,

1061
01:15:33,105 --> 01:15:35,706
including any interest,
processing,

1062
01:15:35,708 --> 01:15:38,576
or late fees
you incur henceforth.

1063
01:15:38,578 --> 01:15:41,138
Does anybody have eyes? MAN
2: Check down the next street!

1064
01:15:53,592 --> 01:15:55,593
- "First to the key."
- "First to the egg."

1065
01:15:55,595 --> 01:15:58,095
Wait, what?

1066
01:15:58,097 --> 01:16:01,465
"Never trust someone you meet
in the OASIS."

1067
01:16:01,467 --> 01:16:04,102
"She might be a 300-pound dude
named Chuck..."

1068
01:16:04,104 --> 01:16:07,307
"Who lives in his mama's
basement in suburban Detroit."

1069
01:16:09,676 --> 01:16:11,608
Aech!

1070
01:16:11,610 --> 01:16:15,114
Helen. My dad called me "H."
It kinda stuck. Let's go!

1071
01:16:24,791 --> 01:16:27,160
That thing's IDing my van.

1072
01:16:41,807 --> 01:16:44,011
Come on. They've spotted us.

1073
01:16:44,644 --> 01:16:46,443
Daito.

1074
01:16:46,445 --> 01:16:49,280
My real name is Toshiro.
Samantha got us a message.

1075
01:16:49,282 --> 01:16:51,115
She told us to meet you here.

1076
01:16:51,117 --> 01:16:52,517
Samantha,
they took her to the...

1077
01:16:52,519 --> 01:16:54,551
The loyalty center, I know.

1078
01:16:54,553 --> 01:16:58,121
Look, in other awesome news, the
Sixers found the third challenge.

1079
01:16:58,123 --> 01:16:59,823
- What?
- Just come on, get in!

1080
01:16:59,825 --> 01:17:01,224
All right. Let's go.

1081
01:17:01,226 --> 01:17:03,363
Hurry up.
Go, go, go. All right.

1082
01:17:15,141 --> 01:17:17,642
How did IOI find
the third challenge so fast?

1083
01:17:17,644 --> 01:17:19,743
IOI cracked the first
three lines of the clue,

1084
01:17:19,745 --> 01:17:21,411
so they knew it was sector 14

1085
01:17:21,413 --> 01:17:22,813
but they couldn't figure out
"the fortress tragic."

1086
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,415
So they sent every guide
they had into that sector

1087
01:17:25,417 --> 01:17:27,320
until they found
the right fortress.

1088
01:17:28,421 --> 01:17:29,687
Sho?

1089
01:17:29,689 --> 01:17:32,189
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm 11, so what?

1090
01:17:32,191 --> 01:17:34,224
His real name is Xo.

1091
01:17:34,226 --> 01:17:36,794
But everyone else calls
me Sho, no big deal.

1092
01:17:36,796 --> 01:17:39,764
No. It is a big deal.

1093
01:17:39,766 --> 01:17:43,334
Sho, you're the world's most
badass 11-year-old ever.

1094
01:17:43,336 --> 01:17:44,402
He knows.

1095
01:17:44,404 --> 01:17:46,603
Shut up! Let him tell me.

1096
01:17:46,605 --> 01:17:47,673
Aech!

1097
01:17:51,211 --> 01:17:52,710
We have to go save Samantha.

1098
01:17:52,712 --> 01:17:55,278
Well, we can't just
go through the doors of IOI.

1099
01:17:55,280 --> 01:17:57,514
Look, I've been thinkin' about it.
I got a better plan.

1100
01:17:57,516 --> 01:17:59,517
You saw Sorrento's rig, right?

1101
01:17:59,519 --> 01:18:01,618
Yeah.

1102
01:18:01,620 --> 01:18:03,854
Let's go after the man himself and
make him give Art3mis back to us.

1103
01:18:03,856 --> 01:18:05,755
But first,
I have to know exactly,

1104
01:18:05,757 --> 01:18:07,693
how much about Sorrento's rig
do you remember?

1105
01:18:09,361 --> 01:18:11,597
Kind of everything.

1106
01:18:25,377 --> 01:18:29,215
<i>Maintenance,
report to loyalty pod 31-B.</i>

1107
01:18:33,319 --> 01:18:37,691
<i>Security, please report
to section 97 for escort.</i>

1108
01:18:58,677 --> 01:19:01,481
Hey! Newbie, get to work.

1109
01:19:03,682 --> 01:19:05,218
Get to work.

1110
01:19:10,923 --> 01:19:14,194
<i>Work violation.
Work violation.</i>

1111
01:19:15,794 --> 01:19:18,832
Lay those charges
every six feet.

1112
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,206
Keep it moving!

1113
01:19:27,539 --> 01:19:28,542
Hey, you!

1114
01:19:30,709 --> 01:19:32,542
Those are explosives!

1115
01:19:34,279 --> 01:19:37,481
IOI will not reimburse
any lost coin if you zero out.

1116
01:19:37,483 --> 01:19:39,218
Keep it moving!

1117
01:19:43,989 --> 01:19:46,823
So what is this challenge,
some sort of video game thing?

1118
01:19:46,825 --> 01:19:48,925
An Atari 2600, sir.

1119
01:19:48,927 --> 01:19:52,666
And every game ever made for it,
thousands of possibilities.

1120
01:19:53,498 --> 01:19:54,865
Come up!

1121
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:00,804
Halliday,

1122
01:20:00,806 --> 01:20:02,740
this is how
you plan to resolve

1123
01:20:02,742 --> 01:20:05,977
the fate of the world's most
important economic resource?

1124
01:20:05,979 --> 01:20:07,945
- Call me when you're close.
- Yes, sir.

1125
01:20:07,947 --> 01:20:09,682
Go, go! No! Ahh!

1126
01:20:12,017 --> 01:20:14,986
One minute into <i>Centipede,</i>
the ice broke.

1127
01:20:14,988 --> 01:20:17,255
It has to be <i>Joust!</i>

1128
01:20:17,257 --> 01:20:19,991
Halliday still holds the world record
on the 2600 port of that game.

1129
01:20:19,993 --> 01:20:21,992
Maybe we just need
to beat his high score.

1130
01:20:21,994 --> 01:20:24,495
<i>Pitfall!</i> One of the only 2600
games that still hasn't ended.

1131
01:20:24,497 --> 01:20:25,929
And how about
those <i>Swordquest</i> games?

1132
01:20:25,931 --> 01:20:27,831
Yes!
The <i>Swordquest</i> games.

1133
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:29,993
They were created for a contest
Atari held with real...

1134
01:20:37,577 --> 01:20:40,577
i-R0k, how are we doin'?

1135
01:20:40,579 --> 01:20:42,847
To be honest, I think I need
physical therapy because it's not...

1136
01:20:42,849 --> 01:20:44,851
Is the Orb ready?

1137
01:20:45,851 --> 01:20:47,520
Um, as you wish.

1138
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:52,857
The Orb...

1139
01:20:52,859 --> 01:20:54,261
Of Osuvox.

1140
01:20:54,926 --> 01:20:56,294
Ah...

1141
01:20:56,296 --> 01:20:58,362
How does it work?

1142
01:20:58,364 --> 01:21:01,799
Has it got, like, a remote or
is there a button or something?

1143
01:21:01,801 --> 01:21:05,435
Nolan, it's a level-99
magic artifact,

1144
01:21:05,437 --> 01:21:09,040
not one of your drones, so it
is activated by a magic spell.

1145
01:21:09,042 --> 01:21:11,278
Would you care
to do the honors?

1146
01:22:03,061 --> 01:22:04,628
Where is she?

1147
01:22:04,630 --> 01:22:05,929
How'd you get in here?

1148
01:22:05,931 --> 01:22:06,996
- Art3mis.
- Who?

1149
01:22:06,998 --> 01:22:11,868
Samantha Cook. Where is she?

1150
01:22:11,870 --> 01:22:15,773
If you wanna talk, we can talk,
but you gotta put that gun down.

1151
01:22:15,775 --> 01:22:18,675
You killed my mom's sister.

1152
01:22:18,677 --> 01:22:20,111
You think I won't kill you?

1153
01:22:20,113 --> 01:22:24,514
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Just slow down, okay?

1154
01:22:24,516 --> 01:22:27,884
That was a corporate decision.
It was not personal.

1155
01:22:27,886 --> 01:22:29,018
Where is she?

1156
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,554
She's downstairs
in the loyalty center!

1157
01:22:31,556 --> 01:22:34,892
I know she's in
the goddamn loyalty center.

1158
01:22:34,894 --> 01:22:37,161
You're gonna tell me
exactly which rig she's in

1159
01:22:37,163 --> 01:22:39,700
and the access code
to contact her.

1160
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:43,035
Yeah, that seems appropriate.

1161
01:22:45,904 --> 01:22:47,907
Start with access code.

1162
01:22:49,141 --> 01:22:51,408
6, 45, 7, 25.

1163
01:22:51,410 --> 01:22:52,678
Where's the rig?

1164
01:23:03,588 --> 01:23:05,822
I think he pissed himself.

1165
01:23:05,824 --> 01:23:07,825
Good job, Z.
We're in his account.

1166
01:23:07,827 --> 01:23:09,562
So he really doesn't know
he's in the OASIS?

1167
01:23:11,931 --> 01:23:14,532
This is what Sorrento
should be seeing,

1168
01:23:14,534 --> 01:23:18,768
but this... This is what we're
making him see.

1169
01:23:18,770 --> 01:23:21,839
We grabbed him in transit just as
he was logging out of the OASIS,

1170
01:23:21,841 --> 01:23:24,707
so he thinks he's back in his
office in the real world.

1171
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:28,545
But actually, he's here, in the
identical office that Aech built.

1172
01:23:28,547 --> 01:23:31,048
So, you basically
just remotely hacked his rig.

1173
01:23:31,050 --> 01:23:34,084
A fixed rig like Sorrento's
is easy to locate, hard to hack.

1174
01:23:34,086 --> 01:23:37,021
Unless he's stupid enough to
leave his password lying around.

1175
01:23:37,023 --> 01:23:38,222
Loyalty center, I'm in.

1176
01:23:38,224 --> 01:23:39,993
All right,
let's get to work.

1177
01:23:47,967 --> 01:23:50,099
<i>- Arty.</i>
- Z? Z? Z?

1178
01:23:50,101 --> 01:23:51,868
Arty, don't say anything.

1179
01:23:51,870 --> 01:23:53,806
I'm tapped directly
into your audio feed.

1180
01:23:55,240 --> 01:23:56,941
<i>How did you find me?</i>

1181
01:23:56,943 --> 01:23:58,645
We got his password,
hacked Sorrento's rig.

1182
01:24:00,078 --> 01:24:02,746
Z, I have something
to tell you.

1183
01:24:02,748 --> 01:24:04,747
<i>Not now. I have something to show
you that'll get you out of there.</i>

1184
01:24:04,749 --> 01:24:08,219
The Sixers found the third challenge.
It's on Planet Doom.

1185
01:24:08,221 --> 01:24:09,753
And there's more,
they just put a force field

1186
01:24:09,755 --> 01:24:11,557
around Anorak's Castle.

1187
01:24:15,994 --> 01:24:18,661
I heard one of the guards
calling it "the Orb of Osuvox,"

1188
01:24:18,663 --> 01:24:21,232
and the only way to take it
down is from the inside.

1189
01:24:21,234 --> 01:24:24,201
She's right.
Level-99 artifact,

1190
01:24:24,203 --> 01:24:27,137
creates a magic-resistant,
impenetrable barrier.

1191
01:24:27,139 --> 01:24:29,072
No way through it.

1192
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:30,808
Okay, listen. That's not
important right now.

1193
01:24:30,810 --> 01:24:32,810
What's important is that
we get you out of the rig.

1194
01:24:34,947 --> 01:24:37,050
<i>All right, so I'm looking
at a diagram of your rig.</i>

1195
01:24:39,985 --> 01:24:42,219
If you reach up with your
left hand at 11 o'clock,

1196
01:24:42,221 --> 01:24:44,191
there's some... there's a
panel above your head.

1197
01:24:48,994 --> 01:24:51,161
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I can feel it.

1198
01:24:51,163 --> 01:24:53,197
<i>Okay, there should be
two release handles.</i>

1199
01:24:53,199 --> 01:24:54,831
<i>Nine o'clock and three o'clock.
Can you feel them?</i>

1200
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:57,037
- Yeah, I got it.
- <i>Okay, pull it towards you.</i>

1201
01:24:59,238 --> 01:25:01,138
<i>Okay, inside the panel,
there's a lever.</i>

1202
01:25:01,140 --> 01:25:03,706
<i>Grab it with your right hand
and slide it to the left.</i>

1203
01:25:03,708 --> 01:25:05,209
<i>That should release you.</i>

1204
01:25:12,284 --> 01:25:15,219
It worked. It worked, I'm out.

1205
01:25:15,221 --> 01:25:17,153
<i>Loyalty pod 41-F,</i>

1206
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:20,092
<i>you are on an authorized
break for 10 minutes.</i>

1207
01:25:25,631 --> 01:25:28,799
<i>Pod 41-F, you are
on 10-minute break.</i>

1208
01:25:28,801 --> 01:25:30,904
<i>Proceed to break area.</i>

1209
01:25:32,203 --> 01:25:33,571
Wade, are you still there?

1210
01:25:33,573 --> 01:25:34,804
<i>Yeah, I'm here. Where are you?</i>

1211
01:25:34,806 --> 01:25:37,006
Where is Sorrento's office?

1212
01:25:37,008 --> 01:25:38,207
<i>It's in the IOI war room, two
levels above where you are now.</i>

1213
01:25:38,209 --> 01:25:40,210
<i>But that's not the way out.</i>

1214
01:25:40,212 --> 01:25:41,748
What's his password?

1215
01:25:43,082 --> 01:25:44,281
Wade, answer me.

1216
01:25:44,283 --> 01:25:48,218
<i>Okay, it's capital
B-0-55-man-69.</i>

1217
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,821
<i>But, Arty, you need to go.</i>

1218
01:25:50,823 --> 01:25:52,092
You need to raise an army.

1219
01:25:53,025 --> 01:25:54,657
An army?

1220
01:25:54,659 --> 01:25:56,259
<i>Get to Planet Doom,
and wait for my signal.</i>

1221
01:25:56,261 --> 01:25:57,361
What signal?

1222
01:25:57,363 --> 01:25:59,697
I'm gonna take down
that shield.

1223
01:25:59,699 --> 01:26:01,699
<i>Wait, Arty, wait! You gotta
get out of there! Arty!</i>

1224
01:26:10,042 --> 01:26:12,675
Hey, how much
are they paying you?

1225
01:26:12,677 --> 01:26:14,243
'Cause, man, I got a lot of paper.

1226
01:26:14,245 --> 01:26:16,847
You know, I can make you,
like, a forest.

1227
01:26:16,849 --> 01:26:19,116
Hey, shut up.

1228
01:26:19,118 --> 01:26:20,220
Okay.

1229
01:26:42,874 --> 01:26:45,108
This isn't real,
you're tapping my feed.

1230
01:26:45,110 --> 01:26:47,113
Uh-oh. Guys.

1231
01:27:05,664 --> 01:27:08,398
F'Nale, they've hacked my rig.
They're after the girl.

1232
01:27:08,400 --> 01:27:10,667
Meet me at loyalty.

1233
01:27:24,182 --> 01:27:27,785
<i>Pod 41-F, you
have exceeded your break time.</i>

1234
01:27:27,787 --> 01:27:31,291
<i>Report to security or your coin
count will be reset to zero.</i>

1235
01:27:40,466 --> 01:27:45,268
So, she just walks out of
here, how does that happen?

1236
01:27:45,270 --> 01:27:47,336
They're smart. They knew
what they were doing.

1237
01:27:47,338 --> 01:27:50,374
But we know they're in Columbus. And
now, all five of them are together.

1238
01:27:50,376 --> 01:27:52,875
Wait. Wait, we know what?
How do we know?

1239
01:27:52,877 --> 01:27:56,447
We have the make and model of the van.
We'll spot them.

1240
01:27:56,449 --> 01:27:58,782
"We'll spot them"?

1241
01:27:58,784 --> 01:28:02,018
That sounds like a great
inscription for our tombstones.

1242
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:03,353
Why didn't you tell me
this earlier?

1243
01:28:03,355 --> 01:28:05,155
It wasn't relevant yet.

1244
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:06,356
I need to know where they are.

1245
01:28:06,358 --> 01:28:07,957
We need to know.
We need to find them!

1246
01:28:07,959 --> 01:28:10,993
They're kids, Nolan.
Man the hell up!

1247
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:14,197
Do your job, and I'll do mine,
unless you wanna take this

1248
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:16,202
and go after them yourself.

1249
01:28:20,806 --> 01:28:22,042

by people who will stop at
nothing to win this contest.

1261
01:29:17,029 --> 01:29:19,062
Some of you already know this,

and you've lost much more than
just your avatars or your weapons.

Some have lost their freedom.
Some have lost their lives.

<i>I found a cause.</i>

<i>I found my friends.</i>

Oh, man.

Come on, come on.
Give me this thing.

1285
01:30:45,984 --> 01:30:47,119

- Left arm!
- Sir.

1288
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:54,457
No, I need the left arm.

1289
01:30:54,459 --> 01:30:56,529
No, I don't care if...
I want it on.

1290

He thinks that we
won't even put up a fight!

1291
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,201
Well, I say he's wrong.

Not the time, Z.

1390
01:45:44,882 --> 01:45:46,448
I can handle the challenge,

1391
01:45:46,450 --> 01:45:49,417
but I can't let you get hurt
in the real world.

1392
01:45:49,419 --> 01:45:52,390
Get out of IOI,
and meet us at River South.

1393
01:45:58,962 --> 01:46:00,496
Wade, no.

1394
01:46:00,498 --> 01:46:02,564
You'll forgive me
for this, I promise.

1395
01:46:02,566 --> 01:46:03,566
Wade, no, no, no.

1396
01:46:13,811 --> 01:46:17,280
Get it together, Sixer.
Back to respawn.

1397
01:46:17,282 --> 01:46:18,414
Let's go, move.

1398
01:46:18,416 --> 01:46:19,818
You're in.

1399
01:46:38,101 --> 01:46:40,536
Holy hand grenade!
How much did that cost?

1400
01:46:40,538 --> 01:46:43,175
Less than
it's gonna cost them.

1401
01:46:44,309 --> 01:46:45,811
What is that?

1402
01:46:56,186 --> 01:46:58,920
Sir, the gunters
are approaching the challenge.

1403
01:46:58,922 --> 01:47:00,923
- i-R0k?
- In position, sir.

1404
01:47:00,925 --> 01:47:02,191
Prepare my rig.

1405
01:47:02,193 --> 01:47:04,829
The ice is holding.
Still going.

1406
01:47:15,172 --> 01:47:16,505
Wait.

1407
01:47:16,507 --> 01:47:17,507
He's trying to win.

1408
01:47:21,011 --> 01:47:23,548
Yeah! I won.

1409
01:47:27,051 --> 01:47:29,018
He lost.

1410
01:47:29,020 --> 01:47:31,023
Not <i>Adventure.</i>

1411
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:39,629
Everyone who wins loses.

1412
01:47:39,631 --> 01:47:42,901
It's not about winning.
It's about playing.

1413
01:47:44,034 --> 01:47:46,535
Remember
Halliday's announcement.

1414
01:47:46,537 --> 01:47:48,970
The keys are invisible, and
they're hidden in a dark room

1415
01:47:48,972 --> 01:47:51,540
that's at the center
of a maze.

1416
01:47:51,542 --> 01:47:55,210
Well, there's a secret in <i>Adventure,</i>
and you don't find it by winning.

1417
01:47:55,212 --> 01:47:58,147
You find it by wandering
around in a dark room.

1418
01:47:58,149 --> 01:47:59,648
Until you get
to the invisible dot.

1419
01:47:59,650 --> 01:48:01,549
It's pretty easy
if you know what you're doing.

1420
01:48:01,551 --> 01:48:02,620
Really?

1421
01:48:03,520 --> 01:48:06,088
Let me finish it for you.

1422
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:11,993
It's your last chance, Wade.

1423
01:48:11,995 --> 01:48:14,697
Last chance. Give me the key.

1424
01:48:14,699 --> 01:48:19,935
I give you 50 million
in your account right now.

1425
01:48:19,937 --> 01:48:21,506
Why the hell
would I ever do that?

1426
01:48:23,507 --> 01:48:25,441
Dude!
That's the Cataclyst.

1427
01:48:25,443 --> 01:48:27,343
Now, personally, I don't care.

1428
01:48:27,345 --> 01:48:29,077
I'd just as soon never set
foot in the OASIS again,

1429
01:48:29,079 --> 01:48:31,246
let alone have to deal
with any of this absurdity.

1430
01:48:31,248 --> 01:48:36,451
But I know how important Halliday's
competition is to you, so...

1431
01:48:36,453 --> 01:48:40,689
I will never let the future of the OASIS
rest in your hands, Nolan Sorrento.

1432
01:48:40,691 --> 01:48:44,727
Well, that's fine.
Three easy steps. One.

1433
01:48:44,729 --> 01:48:47,396
Wait, I thought you were bluffing. You
know that kills all of us, right?

1434
01:48:47,398 --> 01:48:49,465
I've got 10 years' worth
of shit inside of me.

1435
01:48:49,467 --> 01:48:51,133
Last chance. Two.

1436
01:48:51,135 --> 01:48:52,535
I'm not goin' out like that.

1437
01:48:52,537 --> 01:48:54,070
That's a camper move.

1438
01:48:54,072 --> 01:48:55,752
You don't even know
how to activate an orb.

1439
01:49:07,385 --> 01:49:08,453
Yeah, I felt those.

1440
01:49:09,686 --> 01:49:11,957
But this is my world,
Sorrento.

1441
01:49:15,726 --> 01:49:17,162
Hadouken!

1442
01:49:36,780 --> 01:49:39,415
- No, no, no!
- Step three.

1443
01:49:39,417 --> 01:49:41,119
No, no, no!

1444
01:50:38,642 --> 01:50:40,311
Get me out of this thing.

1445
01:50:54,758 --> 01:50:56,192
Uh...

1446
01:50:56,194 --> 01:50:57,428
Guys?

1447
01:51:03,834 --> 01:51:05,669
Z. He's still alive!

1448
01:51:13,778 --> 01:51:15,579
Extra life.

1449
01:51:17,815 --> 01:51:19,418
Thanks, Curator.

1450
01:51:22,285 --> 01:51:23,422
Hold on.

1451
01:51:31,194 --> 01:51:33,795
Live feed
in all OASIS channels.

1452
01:51:33,797 --> 01:51:36,398
Halliday's letting everyone
watch the end of the contest.

1453
01:51:36,400 --> 01:51:37,765
That's so Halliday.

1454
01:51:37,767 --> 01:51:39,835
God damn it,
we tried <i>Adventure.</i>

1455
01:51:39,837 --> 01:51:41,603
No, we tried to win it.

1456
01:51:41,605 --> 01:51:43,872
But the hidden room isn't
at the end of the game.

1457
01:51:43,874 --> 01:51:46,811
You've gotta go straight to the
invisible dot at the start.

1458
01:52:00,257 --> 01:52:02,223
Is that her?

1459
01:52:02,225 --> 01:52:05,628
Red hair, IOI uniform, doesn't
know what planet she's on?

1460
01:52:05,630 --> 01:52:06,664
That's her.

1461
01:52:18,508 --> 01:52:21,245
I'm Toshiro.
You know me as Daito.

1462
01:52:23,948 --> 01:52:25,182
Oh.

1463
01:52:27,952 --> 01:52:29,354
Hey, Arty.

1464
01:52:31,422 --> 01:52:35,590
Yeah, I know. Not what
you were expecting, huh?

1465
01:52:35,592 --> 01:52:40,131
Yeah, I wasn't expecting
a late '30s-model postal van.

1466
01:52:42,199 --> 01:52:44,366
Wade?

1467
01:52:44,368 --> 01:52:46,335
Wait, I thought the Cataclyst went off.
How are you still playing?

1468
01:52:46,337 --> 01:52:48,840
Extra life, long story.
Sorry I shot you.

1469
01:52:50,975 --> 01:52:52,808
Sho?

1470
01:52:52,810 --> 01:52:55,344
What? Do I have to wear
a sign saying,

1471
01:52:55,346 --> 01:52:58,479
"I am 11 years old, shoot me first"?
No, thanks.

1472
01:52:58,481 --> 01:53:00,816
- Dude, give me a hug.
- Ninjas don't hug!

1473
01:53:00,818 --> 01:53:02,498
All right, everybody,
hold on to somethin'.

1474
01:53:23,940 --> 01:53:25,409
Got you.

1475
01:53:28,980 --> 01:53:30,882
Come on, Nolan. Pick up.

1476
01:53:32,882 --> 01:53:35,917
F'Nale, tell me
something good.

1477
01:53:35,919 --> 01:53:38,487
I've got a drone on their tail.
I'm close.

1478
01:53:38,489 --> 01:53:39,755
<i>Send me coordinates.</i>

1479
01:53:39,757 --> 01:53:41,991
Maybe you should
leave this to me, Nolan.

1480
01:53:43,761 --> 01:53:46,364
Nolan? Nolan.

1481
01:53:47,832 --> 01:53:48,934
Out.

1482
01:53:57,908 --> 01:54:00,378
Give me that.

1483
01:54:03,881 --> 01:54:05,784
What's goin' on out there?

1484
01:54:09,986 --> 01:54:12,623
The game is over for them.
What are they watching?

1485
01:54:14,925 --> 01:54:17,428
The final key!
It's being broadcast.

1486
01:54:19,529 --> 01:54:20,996
<i>You see,</i>

1487
01:54:20,998 --> 01:54:23,898
<i>Warren Robinett
was proud of</i> Adventure.

1488
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,969
<i>He wanted people to know
who was behind it.</i>

1489
01:54:26,971 --> 01:54:29,705
That's why he created
the first digital Easter egg

1490
01:54:29,707 --> 01:54:32,407
and to find it,
you didn't even have to win.

1491
01:54:32,409 --> 01:54:36,577
You just had to blindly play,
searching around

1492
01:54:36,579 --> 01:54:40,715
in rooms for an invisible dot.

1493
01:54:40,717 --> 01:54:43,085
You took the dot
back to the main screen

1494
01:54:43,087 --> 01:54:47,923
and that's when you found the first
Easter egg ever put in a video game.

1495
01:54:47,925 --> 01:54:49,205
The creator's name.

1496
01:55:13,850 --> 01:55:15,951
What's going on, man?
I can't see shit.

1497
01:55:15,953 --> 01:55:17,322
Parzival just got
the Crystal Key!

1498
01:55:32,636 --> 01:55:34,339
Do you want it or not?

1499
01:55:37,675 --> 01:55:39,774
Aech,
what the hell's going on?

1500
01:55:39,776 --> 01:55:41,777
Just practicing my <i>Mario Kart.</i>
What do you think?

1501
01:55:41,779 --> 01:55:43,815
IOI's trying to kill us, man!

1502
01:55:58,061 --> 01:56:00,396
Everyone watching, if you're
in the Columbus stacks,

1503
01:56:00,398 --> 01:56:02,464
this is Parzival.

1504
01:56:02,466 --> 01:56:04,665
My real-world name is Wade Watts,
and we're gonna need your help.

1505
01:56:04,667 --> 01:56:06,033
Aech, head for the stacks!

1506
01:56:06,035 --> 01:56:08,504
Okay, hold on!

1507
01:56:33,163 --> 01:56:35,099
Stick the key in,
how hard is it?

1508
01:56:40,837 --> 01:56:42,005
Come on.

1509
01:56:49,447 --> 01:56:51,449
Yeah! Yes!

1510
01:57:07,698 --> 01:57:08,900
That's it?

1511
01:57:09,733 --> 01:57:11,599
Yeah, that's it.

1512
01:57:11,601 --> 01:57:16,103
Now, you just sign these papers,
and the OASIS is yours.

1513
01:57:16,105 --> 01:57:20,209
You will be
its sole proprietor.

1514
01:57:20,211 --> 01:57:21,880
That ain't so bad, is it?

1515
01:57:43,734 --> 01:57:44,769
I'm gonna need a second.

1516
01:58:13,264 --> 01:58:16,098
This is wrong.

1517
01:58:16,100 --> 01:58:18,970
This pen, this contract.

1518
01:58:22,206 --> 01:58:23,972
This is the moment
that Halliday made Morrow

1519
01:58:23,974 --> 01:58:26,541
sign over his shares
in Gregarious.

1520
01:58:26,543 --> 01:58:29,210
That was the biggest mistake
of his life.

1521
01:58:29,212 --> 01:58:31,148
He knew that.

1522
01:58:33,117 --> 01:58:35,153
This can't be the end.

1523
01:58:36,153 --> 01:58:38,056
It's a test.

1524
01:58:42,626 --> 01:58:45,096
I won't make
the same mistake you did.

1525
01:58:51,001 --> 01:58:52,870
Oh, good.

1526
01:58:55,573 --> 01:58:59,010
I just needed to be sure.

1527
01:59:13,023 --> 01:59:15,226
This is where you grew up.

1528
01:59:24,301 --> 01:59:27,234
Oh, that's just me
a long time ago.

1529
01:59:27,236 --> 01:59:31,039
I like to have him around
from time to time.

1530
01:59:31,041 --> 01:59:33,341
Hey, I have
to show you something.

1531
01:59:33,343 --> 01:59:35,042
This, uh... Come on.

1532
01:59:35,044 --> 01:59:36,878
This is the button.

1533
01:59:36,880 --> 01:59:40,182
If you push it, the whole
simulation shuts down

1534
01:59:40,184 --> 01:59:43,785
and a tapeworm program will erase
all of the backup servers.

1535
01:59:43,787 --> 01:59:47,356
So you now have the power
to turn the OASIS off forever.

1536
01:59:47,358 --> 01:59:49,127
Do you understand?

1537
01:59:54,364 --> 01:59:55,731
Yeah,

1538
01:59:55,733 --> 01:59:57,698
try not to accidentally erase

1539
01:59:57,700 --> 02:00:00,171
the whole of the OASIS
on your first day.

1540
02:00:09,747 --> 02:00:11,249
The stacks are straight ahead!

1541
02:00:27,264 --> 02:00:30,232
Well, I expect you have to go.
I know I do.

1542
02:00:30,234 --> 02:00:32,768
So, now is the time for you
to receive your prize

1543
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:35,303
because you won
all three keys.

1544
02:00:35,305 --> 02:00:40,008
Once you take this egg,
the game will be over.

1545
02:00:40,010 --> 02:00:43,081
The egg, the egg...

1546
02:00:50,319 --> 02:00:52,954
We know what you did here.

1547
02:00:52,956 --> 02:00:56,260
You turn around and walk out
of here while you still can.

1548
02:01:08,872 --> 02:01:11,439
I created the OASIS

1549
02:01:11,441 --> 02:01:16,178
because I never felt at home
in the real world.

1550
02:01:16,180 --> 02:01:20,448
I just didn't know how to
connect with the people there.

1551
02:01:20,450 --> 02:01:24,152
I was afraid
for all of my life.

1552
02:01:24,154 --> 02:01:26,891
Right up until the day
I knew my life was ending.

1553
02:01:32,328 --> 02:01:37,331
Now, that... That was when
I realized that,

1554
02:01:37,333 --> 02:01:42,439
as terrifying and painful
as reality can be,

1555
02:01:43,507 --> 02:01:47,311
it's also the only place

1556
02:01:49,178 --> 02:01:50,815
that you can get
a decent meal.

1557
02:01:57,488 --> 02:01:58,990
Because

1558
02:02:00,524 --> 02:02:02,325
reality

1559
02:02:07,498 --> 02:02:09,164
is real.

1560
02:02:09,166 --> 02:02:10,868
You understand
what I'm saying?

1561
02:02:12,502 --> 02:02:15,338
Yes. Yes, I do.

1562
02:02:25,114 --> 02:02:26,383
He did it.

1563
02:02:28,084 --> 02:02:29,352
He got the egg.

1564
02:02:30,386 --> 02:02:31,421
Hooray.

1565
02:02:32,789 --> 02:02:34,425
- No!
- No! Please!

1566
02:03:07,990 --> 02:03:09,260
Hold it!

1567
02:03:11,328 --> 02:03:15,095
Drop the gun! Now!
On the ground!

1568
02:03:15,097 --> 02:03:17,832
Turn around!
Hands on your head.

1569
02:03:17,834 --> 02:03:19,403
Walk back towards me.

1570
02:03:35,118 --> 02:03:40,354
Mr. Halliday.
Something I don't understand.

1571
02:03:40,356 --> 02:03:43,093
You're not an avatar, are you?

1572
02:03:43,493 --> 02:03:45,329
No.

1573
02:03:46,864 --> 02:03:48,866
Is Halliday really dead?

1574
02:03:50,534 --> 02:03:52,136
Yes.

1575
02:03:57,874 --> 02:03:59,443
Then what are you?

1576
02:04:02,880 --> 02:04:04,849
Goodbye, Parzival.

1577
02:04:06,516 --> 02:04:07,516
Thanks.

1578
02:04:09,151 --> 02:04:11,355
Thanks for playing my game.

1579
02:04:40,383 --> 02:04:41,484
Wade?

1580
02:04:43,086 --> 02:04:45,019
- Ogden Morrow?
- Ogden Morrow?

1581
02:04:45,021 --> 02:04:47,188
You can call me "Og."

1582
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:50,157
Now, there are some people out here
that would very much like to meet you.

1583
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:53,394
Wow, this is incredible.

1584
02:04:53,396 --> 02:04:56,167
It's an honor to meet you,
Og, but I...

1585
02:05:00,369 --> 02:05:02,038
There's something
I need to do first.

1586
02:05:05,943 --> 02:05:07,511
I'm not like Halliday.

1587
02:05:11,448 --> 02:05:13,517
I'm taking the leap.

1588
02:05:29,967 --> 02:05:33,100
We're looking for Wade Watts.

1589
02:05:33,102 --> 02:05:35,370
We need you to make a statement
about the clip you sent in

1590
02:05:35,372 --> 02:05:37,572
of Nolan Sorrento's
confession.

1591
02:05:37,574 --> 02:05:40,308
Uh, that was me.

1592
02:05:40,310 --> 02:05:42,680
What? I record everything
in my workshop.

1593
02:05:49,285 --> 02:05:51,154
Help me out of this.

1594
02:05:57,493 --> 02:05:59,594
Who are you guys?

1595
02:05:59,596 --> 02:06:04,101
The people you need right now, lawyers.
From Gregarious Games.

1596
02:06:06,736 --> 02:06:08,572
They want
your signature, Wade.

1597
02:06:16,512 --> 02:06:18,780
I'm splitting it with my clan.

1598
02:06:18,782 --> 02:06:20,583
We're gonna
run things together.

1599
02:06:25,122 --> 02:06:27,322
That's a good choice.

1600
02:06:55,118 --> 02:06:58,719
F'Nale, listen to me
very carefully.

1601
02:07:07,364 --> 02:07:10,298
Mr. Morrow... I mean, Og,

1602
02:07:10,300 --> 02:07:11,799
how'd you get here so fast?

1603
02:07:11,801 --> 02:07:14,501
I flew from the stars
on my magic sleigh.

1604
02:07:14,503 --> 02:07:17,072
Everyone's been watching.

1605
02:07:17,074 --> 02:07:20,311
Of course, I've been watching
a little closer than most.

1606
02:07:24,346 --> 02:07:26,246
You?

1607
02:07:26,248 --> 02:07:27,484
You're the Curator?

1608
02:07:31,221 --> 02:07:34,688
Well played, Parzival.

1609
02:07:34,690 --> 02:07:36,723
Jim told me
nothing about the contest,

1610
02:07:36,725 --> 02:07:40,094
so there was no rule about me
losing a bet to a smart kid.

1611
02:07:40,096 --> 02:07:42,729
Not that you needed my help.

1612
02:07:42,731 --> 02:07:46,867
You figured out that Kira
was the key on your own.

1613
02:07:46,869 --> 02:07:49,707
Yeah, but...
Kira wasn't the key.

1614
02:07:50,841 --> 02:07:52,709
It was you, Mr. Morrow.

1615
02:07:54,845 --> 02:07:56,878
You were the Rosebud.

1616
02:07:56,880 --> 02:07:59,083
And Halliday's
biggest regret was

1617
02:08:00,784 --> 02:08:02,386
losing his only friend.

1618
02:08:06,623 --> 02:08:08,755
You know,
Jim used to say the OASIS

1619
02:08:08,757 --> 02:08:11,428
was never supposed to be
a one-player game.

1620
02:08:15,132 --> 02:08:17,732
Now, who do we have here?

1621
02:08:17,734 --> 02:08:20,602
Oh. Well, look who it is.

1622
02:08:20,604 --> 02:08:22,370
It's my heroes, the High Five.

1623
02:08:22,372 --> 02:08:23,838
- You must be Art3mis.
- Samantha.

1624
02:08:23,840 --> 02:08:25,773
<i>The High Five
took over the OASIS,</i>

1625
02:08:25,775 --> 02:08:27,875
<i>and the first thing we did</i>

1626
02:08:27,877 --> 02:08:30,911
<i>was sign Ogden Morrow to
a non-exclusive consultancy.</i>

1627
02:08:30,913 --> 02:08:33,915
<i>The salary, per his demand,</i>

1628
02:08:33,917 --> 02:08:37,384
<i>was 25 cents. One quarter.</i>

1629
02:08:40,590 --> 02:08:42,790
<i>With his guidance,
our second move was to ban</i>

1630
02:08:42,792 --> 02:08:46,460
<i>any loyalty centers
from accessing the OASIS.</i>

1631
02:08:46,462 --> 02:08:49,699
<i>IOI had no choice.
They shut 'em all down.</i>

1632
02:08:52,668 --> 02:08:55,670
<i>The third thing we did
wasn't as popular.</i>

1633
02:08:55,672 --> 02:08:59,674
<i>We closed the OASIS
on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</i>

1634
02:08:59,676 --> 02:09:02,176
<i>I know, it sounds
like a weird move,</i>

1635
02:09:02,178 --> 02:09:04,882
<i>but people need to spend
more time in the real world.</i>

1636
02:09:06,749 --> 02:09:09,817
<i>'Cause, like Halliday said,</i>

1637
02:09:09,819 --> 02:09:14,158
<i>reality is the only thing
that's real.</i>
