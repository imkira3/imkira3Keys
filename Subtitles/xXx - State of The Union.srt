1
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:23,142
Easy, now.

2
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:26,110
Easy, boys.

3
00:01:29,823 --> 00:01:31,848
Easy, now.

4
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:39,024
What the hell?

5
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,801
Code red. Code red. We got a sit--

6
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,356
Sir, we have a breach
in the perimeter.

7
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,400
Go secure. Sweep the hard drives.
Lock us down.

8
00:02:45,798 --> 00:02:48,494
Heat signatures everywhere.
They've covered all the halls.

9
00:02:48,668 --> 00:02:50,533
Then I guess we better
clear the halls.

10
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:57,737
Go!

11
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,138
Evacuate! Now!

12
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,292
Come on. I dare you to come walking
through that door. Come get some.

13
00:03:50,196 --> 00:03:51,754
Keys.

14
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,293
- Who the hell did we piss off this time?
- Get in.

15
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,932
- This thing armed?
- Always.

16
00:03:59,105 --> 00:04:00,697
Good man.

17
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,027
You ever seen one of these?

18
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,426
Only in my dreams.

19
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:28,328
Geothermal micro cam,
Aquacade uplinks, 480 gigs.

20
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:31,527
Sir, this thing is 1 0 generations
beyond the NSA.

21
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,002
So whoever attacked us
is loaded for war.

22
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,842
And they knew
exactly where to hit us.

23
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,637
We gotta go off the grid now.

24
00:04:38,811 --> 00:04:41,678
Not another skater,
snowboarder or biker.

25
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,248
The new XXX has gotta be
more dangerous.

26
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,282
Deadlier. More attitude.

27
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,044
More attitude?

28
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:52,486
Where the hell
are we gonna find that?

29
00:06:28,287 --> 00:06:30,278
You have a meeting
with the EPA at noon...

30
00:06:30,456 --> 00:06:32,185
- ...to discuss--
- A tree is a tree.

31
00:06:32,358 --> 00:06:33,825
How many more can they look at?

32
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:35,961
Your anniversary, roses or tulips?

33
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,587
George. Tulips, yellow. Thank you.

34
00:06:39,766 --> 00:06:41,893
An NSA chapter was just hit.

35
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,127
Sixteen agents, all dead.

36
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:46,271
Sixteen of our men?

37
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,964
On our own soil?
How the hell did this happen?

38
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,973
I'm looking into it.

39
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,272
- Suspects?
- Too many.

40
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:56,807
How concerned do I need to be?

41
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,248
I'll take care of it.
Quick and clean. And contained.

42
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,450
Goddamn it, 1 6 men?

43
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,182
How many more have to die?

44
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,019
This is no longer a budget meeting.

45
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:11,629
The secretary of defense
has just informed me...

46
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:15,097
...that 1 6 of our NSA agents
were killed.

47
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,496
In Virginia.

48
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:20,799
This is a laundry list of suspects
that covers half the world.

49
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,876
It's time for a new direction.

50
00:07:25,044 --> 00:07:29,037
The new military bill
is critical to that direction.

51
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:33,311
So it's going in my State of the Union
address this week.

52
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,233
Some privacy, please.
Attorney-client privilege.

53
00:08:01,848 --> 00:08:03,816
Good to see you again, lieutenant.

54
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,146
How long has it been? Nine years?

55
00:08:09,722 --> 00:08:11,553
Not long enough.

56
00:08:11,724 --> 00:08:13,487
And don't call me "lieutenant."

57
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,253
I'm inmate 3655 now.

58
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:20,061
What you doing here, Gibbons?
What you want?

59
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,031
You. I wanna give you a job.

60
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,295
And why would
I do a damn thing for you?

61
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,668
You ever see lions at the zoo?

62
00:08:30,476 --> 00:08:33,172
You can always tell the ones
that were captured in the wild--

63
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,143
By the look in their eyes.

64
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:39,876
Jesus Christ. You still coming
with that same sorry-ass speech?

65
00:08:40,052 --> 00:08:42,020
Does it ever actually work?

66
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,919
- From time to time, yeah.
- Not this time.

67
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,459
I'm not feeling too patriotic
these days.

68
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,529
So I want no part of your little war.

69
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,790
You're already part of it.

70
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:56,901
Somebody's taken out
members of our old unit.

71
00:08:57,069 --> 00:09:00,470
They came for me.
They will come for you.

72
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,775
Now, you can die in here,
or you can take the fight to them.

73
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:09,039
The Darius I remember always
liked to throw the first punch.

74
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,452
New speech, huh?

75
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:24,127
You get any exercise in here?

76
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,322
Twelve to 1 every day on the yard.

77
00:09:26,499 --> 00:09:28,626
1 2:06 tomorrow.

78
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:31,929
- Bravo Delta High Sign.
- High Sign?

79
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:35,574
High Sign. Be just like old times.

80
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,643
You better hope not.

81
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:41,575
Because last time out didn't have
such a happy ending.

82
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,147
You went MIA,
and I ended up in here.

83
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:46,182
Okay, wrap it up.

84
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:47,910
Hey.

85
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:51,480
I like what you did with your face.

86
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,147
Come on, let's go.

87
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:03,329
There's been a report
from home office.

88
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:06,369
Xander Cage was killed
in Bora Bora last night.

89
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:08,200
Bora Bora?

90
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:11,036
Why don't I get
those assignments, huh?

91
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,702
What about Gibbons?
Any word on Gibbons?

92
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,279
Unaccounted for. We do know this:

93
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,850
He was one of only three men
with access to that elevator.

94
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,316
The other two....

95
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:23,853
Ain't gonna be giving us
much of a statement.

96
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:28,851
All right, put Mr. Gibbons on the wire.
Full recon. Wrap it tight.

97
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:32,963
A-Block to exercise yard.

98
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,123
A-Block to exercise yard.

99
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,538
Time to take the dog out for a walk.

100
00:10:57,456 --> 00:10:59,185
You know...

101
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,556
- ...I'm gonna really miss you boys.
- What?

102
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:14,672
- Secure all doors!
- Prisoner, stand down!

103
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,774
- Level six, lockdown!
- Get backup up here!

104
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,678
Prisoner, stand down!

105
00:11:25,284 --> 00:11:26,615
Get him!

106
00:11:30,923 --> 00:11:32,618
- Laundry! West door!
- Marco!

107
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,320
Got him.
Two hundred and fifty yards.

108
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,088
Where's he gonna go?
He's nowhere near the wall.

109
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:19,094
All right, man!

110
00:12:46,465 --> 00:12:47,454
- Get him!
- Hold it!

111
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,328
Come back!

112
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,324
You were late.

113
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:22,059
You sure know
how to pick them, sir.

114
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:26,068
Who the hell is this guy?

115
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:27,899
Civilian contractor.

116
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:31,042
By the time he wakes up,
we'll be long gone.

117
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:40,982
- You said 1 2:06.
- Hit some turbulence.

118
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,122
- We got large and extra large.
- Who are you, the butler?

119
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,087
Toby Lee Shavers,
D.C. Tech Division.

120
00:13:46,258 --> 00:13:48,783
- Yeah. Darius Stone, cellblock A.
- Not anymore.

121
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,054
Darius Stone no longer exists.

122
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,391
- Well, who the hell am l?
- You're the new XXX.

123
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:54,965
Sound like a porno star.

124
00:13:55,134 --> 00:13:57,364
- What happened to the old XXX?
- He's dead.

125
00:13:57,536 --> 00:14:01,404
XXX is the designation we give to
deep-cover agents with special skills.

126
00:14:01,574 --> 00:14:03,735
Yeah, whatever. First things first.

127
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,036
I've been on the inside a long time.

128
00:14:06,212 --> 00:14:09,045
I need what every man needs
when he's coming off of lockdown.

129
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:10,682
You know what I'm saying?

130
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:17,051
Yeah, baby. Who's your daddy?

131
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,787
You sure we got the right guy?

132
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,694
Hey, buddy,
more fries and another shake.

133
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,596
You got it.

134
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:35,129
- We need to go to work now.
- I need more fries and another shake.

135
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,901
Hey, you work for us now.

136
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,477
- So you're gonna do--
- What I want when I want.

137
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:43,741
Look...

138
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:48,080
...by my count, you boys just broke
about 1 0 federal laws back there.

139
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:50,814
Aiding and abetting,
harboring a fugitive...

140
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,481
...and my personal favorite,
grand-theft chopper.

141
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,190
- So, what's your point?
- That you two...

142
00:14:57,363 --> 00:15:02,892
...are looking at three strikes
and the inside of a very small cell.

143
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:06,333
- You know that's my speech.
- I'm running the show now.

144
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,996
So here's the deal:
I don't answer to you...

145
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:11,642
...and I damn sure don't answer
to college boy.

146
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:13,573
College boy?

147
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:16,205
Done.

148
00:15:18,117 --> 00:15:19,641
Pay the man.

149
00:15:19,818 --> 00:15:23,914
Okay. So we know you can fight
and eat, but what else can you do?

150
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,820
The last XXX, he could ski, surf,
do all kinds of stunts.

151
00:15:27,993 --> 00:15:29,722
Well, he's dead now, isn't he?

152
00:15:29,895 --> 00:15:31,954
So things are gonna be
different around here.

153
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,689
Because I don't play with my life.

154
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:37,597
- I'd rather play with yours.
- We gotta get back to D.C.

155
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:40,000
We need a place to lay low.

156
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:44,140
I know the safest place in town.

157
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,652
This is the safest place in town?

158
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,631
Stay put. I'll handle this.

159
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:54,037
D-Train Stone.

160
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,114
Heard they had you locked down
in the deepest hole...

161
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,840
...this side of the Grand Canyon.

162
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,181
Yeah, they let me out early
for bad behavior.

163
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,517
- Man, it's been a while, D.
- Where's the boss? I need to talk.

164
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:09,058
Man, a lot's been changing
since you left, D.

165
00:17:09,228 --> 00:17:11,059
I run the chop shop now.

166
00:17:12,464 --> 00:17:15,763
- Where's Lo?
- Uptown.

167
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:17,925
Uptown?

168
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,704
Now, this is more like it.

169
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,309
Welcome to the west side, X.

170
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:28,446
You wanna run in these circles,
you're gonna have to blend.

171
00:17:28,614 --> 00:17:30,206
I don't blend.

172
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:40,356
The Dino has the torque curve
dropping off around 6400 rpm.

173
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:44,326
Dial down the injector pulse width
by about 1 0 percent.

174
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,794
Try 20.

175
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:53,631
Darius.

176
00:17:54,773 --> 00:17:56,104
You look older.

177
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,766
Nine years of bad food
will do that to you.

178
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:00,939
Nine years.

179
00:18:02,014 --> 00:18:06,110
Well, correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't that a few years shy of 20?

180
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,485
Just tell me what you need
so we can do this and be done.

181
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,419
That is why you're here, right?
You need something.

182
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,991
Hot shower, place to crash.

183
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:21,362
Look around, Darius.

184
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:24,200
I've got a good life here.

185
00:18:24,369 --> 00:18:27,770
And I'm not gonna let you
wreck it this time.

186
00:18:28,607 --> 00:18:30,438
So...

187
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:34,441
...what's in it for me?

188
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,210
'67 GTO.

189
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,409
Thousand horsepower, crate motor,
trick suspension.

190
00:18:41,587 --> 00:18:42,918
- What?
- He's right.

191
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,719
- They'll be looking for it.
- Besides, if we're gonna roll...

192
00:18:46,892 --> 00:18:50,225
...we're gonna need something
with a little more muscle.

193
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:52,493
Something nasty.

194
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,459
I can do nasty.

195
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,295
I know you can.

196
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:01,399
Bored and stroked,
full roller, 8 liters.

197
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:06,135
Supercharged with a 25-psi boost,
automated hydraulics...

198
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:09,644
...high-stall converter with shift kit.
That gonna do the trick?

199
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:11,840
- You happy?
- I'm good.

200
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:13,678
I love this girl.

201
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:27,360
All right, the target is information.

202
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,900
It's on a hard drive
inside my old headquarters, here.

203
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:33,062
The rest of it is at my house.

204
00:19:33,238 --> 00:19:35,536
- I'll pick that up tonight while you--
- Information?

205
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:37,334
Well, start by giving me some.

206
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:41,204
- We on the same page?
- You know what I'm talking about.

207
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:44,042
Last time out, I went down,
and you disappeared.

208
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:47,276
Look, you aren't the only one
who lost something that day.

209
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,453
When the fire started,
you were busy with the general.

210
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:53,785
Some of us went in
to see who we could save.

211
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,759
Now, you think this looks bad? You
should've seen it before I got it fixed.

212
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,967
Guess nobody's story
has a happy ending.

213
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:13,008
Story's not over yet, soldier.

214
00:20:13,345 --> 00:20:14,812
Shavers...

215
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:17,915
...can you make that
into a personal weapon?

216
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,875
Give me an hour.

217
00:20:22,788 --> 00:20:25,689
- We straight?
- It's funny, captain.

218
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:29,054
Wars come and go,
but my soldiers stay eternal.

219
00:20:29,795 --> 00:20:32,229
I like that. Who said it?

220
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,729
- Jefferson? Patton?
- Tupac.

221
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,948
All right, X, this is a covert op.

222
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:52,777
Full stealth, total silence.

223
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:55,984
You're gonna wanna be
real delicate here.

224
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:03,951
Subtle.

225
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:08,094
Very subtle.

226
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,859
This is sector 1 4.

227
00:21:10,035 --> 00:21:12,299
We got an attack, topside.

228
00:21:12,804 --> 00:21:16,672
You two, hold the floor.
Everybody else, follow me.

229
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,341
All right, X, you got three minutes.

230
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,255
X, Gibbons' office is
northwest corner, sector four.

231
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,726
Hey! Wait!

232
00:21:50,676 --> 00:21:51,836
X, main room.

233
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,478
Remove the first of three drives
facing you.

234
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,717
There's nobody here.

235
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:04,480
Yeah, except for all of us.

236
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,148
It wasn't an attack,
it was a diversion.

237
00:22:08,894 --> 00:22:12,523
All right, X, they're coming
back down. You gotta go. Now.

238
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,389
Lock this place down.

239
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,186
I want him in hand, alive.

240
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,795
College boy, I'm cut off.
Get me out of here.

241
00:22:44,963 --> 00:22:47,693
Okay, X. Boat dock,
quarter mile, dead ahead.

242
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:53,160
I want that truck.

243
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:56,432
Block every road
in a 10-mile radius.

244
00:24:04,476 --> 00:24:05,875
Everybody okay?

245
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,604
Blows up my car,
he blows up my boats.

246
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,847
Who the hell is this guy?

247
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,985
All right, college boy,
I'm headed upstream.

248
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,721
X, got a little bit of a problem here.

249
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:24,555
This is the police.

250
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:27,163
Goddamn!
All you had to do was drive.

251
00:24:27,332 --> 00:24:30,165
You know what, X?
I'm really starting to miss the old XXX.

252
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:32,632
Stop your vehicle now.

253
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,829
Okay, I see you.

254
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:52,350
Hey, get your ass
out the driver's seat.

255
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,127
Mission accomplished.

256
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:39,397
Darius Stone. Born south side, D.C.
Mother died young, father raised him.

257
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,300
Not much to report till '88.

258
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:45,307
His dad was killed by a stray bullet
in a 21 1, and Darius went off the grid.

259
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,041
Started with graffiti,
reckless driving.

260
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,614
Quickly worked his way up to
grand-theft auto and resisting arrest.

261
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,684
Took him some time
to find his calling in the Navy.

262
00:25:54,853 --> 00:25:56,753
Specifically, the Navy SEALs.

263
00:25:56,922 --> 00:26:00,722
Trained sniper, top scores.
Urban recon, demolition.

264
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,953
The highest dive in Navy history,
250 feet.

265
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,497
Augustus Gibbons recruited him
into an elite unit, Level 5 Classified.

266
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,898
Ran ops in Eastern Europe
till Christmas in Kosovo.

267
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,968
Their general ordered them
to set a fire to clear civilians...

268
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:19,338
...but Stone refused. Led a mutiny
against a four-star general...

269
00:26:19,511 --> 00:26:22,071
...the current secretary of defense,
George Deckert...

270
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,477
...who had him court-martialed
for a 20-year term.

271
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:26,640
Ten for disobeying direct orders...

272
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,412
...and another 1 0 for breaking
the general's jaw.

273
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,851
This is the last footage
we have on him.

274
00:26:32,023 --> 00:26:34,992
A meeting with his lawyer,
Jonathan Edward Cochran.

275
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,787
Oh, that's cute.

276
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,422
Johnnie Cochran.

277
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:43,100
I don't think Mr. Stone can afford
Johnnie's fee. Do we have audio?

278
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,963
It's attorney-client. No mikes.

279
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,161
Hold it there. Okay, reel it back.

280
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,141
Back, back, back. Freeze it.

281
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,870
Blow it up.

282
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,975
Gibbons and Stone
on a comeback tour.

283
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,142
All right, listen up. I want all eyes
up and running on these two.

284
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,810
And I want hard 20s
on the rest of their old unit.

285
00:27:03,989 --> 00:27:05,456
I wanna know where they are...

286
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,491
...I wanna know what they're doing,
and I wanna know now.

287
00:28:37,649 --> 00:28:39,913
I'm disappointed, Auggie.

288
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,953
Checkmate in three?

289
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:44,679
You should've seen it coming.

290
00:28:49,694 --> 00:28:52,128
Relax. Have a drink.

291
00:28:52,297 --> 00:28:56,666
- I took the liberty of pouring myself--
- You were always taking liberties.

292
00:28:57,669 --> 00:28:59,830
Same old Gibbons.

293
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,268
Good soldier with a bad attitude.

294
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,467
You know, I always remember
the first day we met.

295
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:08,942
I remember the last day I saw you.

296
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:13,411
I bet you do.

297
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:17,788
Didn't heal too well, did it?

298
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,918
Some wounds never do.

299
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,994
- I never asked you to go into that fire.
- You just set it and watched it burn.

300
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:26,824
We did what needed to be done.

301
00:29:26,998 --> 00:29:29,398
Is that what you call it?
"Doing what you need to do"?

302
00:29:29,567 --> 00:29:33,503
Sixteen of my men killed?
What's that, just more friendly fire?

303
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:38,638
Some men die so others may live.

304
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:41,944
Funny...

305
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,877
...that you never seem to be the one
doing any of the dying.

306
00:29:45,049 --> 00:29:48,883
I'll do whatever it takes
to best protect this nation.

307
00:29:49,053 --> 00:29:52,545
You're not protecting the nation.
You're doing this to protect yourself.

308
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:56,285
- Why? What fires you starting now?
- We both live in the same world.

309
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,759
- We know what's out there.
- Save the speech.

310
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:02,132
Just so you know...

311
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,531
...whatever you're up to,
you're not getting away with it.

312
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:07,837
Why?

313
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:10,497
Because Darius Stone
is gonna stop me?

314
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,176
I'm sorry.

315
00:30:13,611 --> 00:30:16,478
Was that supposed to be
a surprise?

316
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,378
Gibbons, I know every move you make
even before you do.

317
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:21,678
You still work for me,
whether you know it or not.

318
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,686
I never worked for you.

319
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:28,383
- I work for my country.
- I don't know what's more pathetic...

320
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,357
...a man that plays chess
with himself...

321
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:33,053
...or a man that doesn't see
he's already lost.

322
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,330
Make it look like an accident.
Zero exposure.

323
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:15,261
Sir, they found Gibbons.

324
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:20,036
Investigators say an apparent
gas leak triggered the explosion.

325
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,078
The fire department was too late
to save the occupant...

326
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:25,808
...but managed to contain the fire
before it spread.

327
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:29,420
The deceased, Augustus Gibbons,
was a former Navy captain.

328
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:31,214
He was 5 1 years old.

329
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,789
The funeral's tomorrow
at Arlington National Cemetery.

330
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:35,823
Gas leak. Right.

331
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,486
This is Lisa Joyner reporting from
Chevy Chase, Maryland for WJLA.

332
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,894
Back to you in the studio.

333
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,395
Toby, let's get to work.

334
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,570
There's nothing on here. Nothing.

335
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,506
It's blank, man.

336
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,169
Because you're looking
in the wrong place.

337
00:31:56,347 --> 00:31:59,145
Gibbons said it was
on the hard drive.

338
00:32:00,985 --> 00:32:02,919
What are you doing?

339
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:13,325
I read about that.

340
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:15,295
Cold War. Old school, right?

341
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:16,763
Not that old school.

342
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,742
All right.

343
00:32:31,416 --> 00:32:33,850
Now, which one's Charlie?

344
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:36,777
Only one way to find out.

345
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,919
Ready. Aim.

346
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,422
Fire.

347
00:32:42,026 --> 00:32:45,291
Ready. Aim. Fire.

348
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:48,261
Order arms.

349
00:32:55,907 --> 00:32:59,343
Like our Lord and savior...

350
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:03,947
...Augustus Eugene Gibbons
died in our service.

351
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:08,517
Head of the NSA, FBI, Joint Chiefs,
secretary of state.

352
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,085
Damn.

353
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,017
You know what this means, right?

354
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,215
- What?
- They're gonna kill me next.

355
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,188
- Give me those.
- Damn, man.

356
00:33:17,362 --> 00:33:20,388
If we're working together,
you should work on your partner skills.

357
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,898
Like, if you want something,
try "Please," "May I borrow...?"

358
00:33:24,068 --> 00:33:27,128
Please, may I borrow
the binoculars...

359
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,000
...before I kick your teeth in?

360
00:33:29,874 --> 00:33:33,401
Okay.
See, now, that's a start. Not bad.

361
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,208
- Deckert?
- You know Secretary Deckert?

362
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,079
Oh, yeah.

363
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:42,514
We go way back.

364
00:33:44,222 --> 00:33:46,884
But he hated everything
about Gibbons.

365
00:33:47,058 --> 00:33:49,390
So, what is he doing here?

366
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,896
- Charlie.
- You found him.

367
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,892
Her.

368
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,258
- Her?
- Can you get me a suit?

369
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,727
Oh, so now you wanna blend.

370
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,528
I hear this place
has the best gumbo in town.

371
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:34,000
Excuse me.

372
00:34:34,172 --> 00:34:36,265
I'm actually meeting someone
for lunch.

373
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:40,070
Relax, Charlie.
This'll only take a minute.

374
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:44,607
How did you know my name?
Who are you?

375
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,880
We have a mutual friend.

376
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,279
Augustus Gibbons.

377
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,816
Had a mutual friend.

378
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:52,888
And you didn't answer my question.

379
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,922
Who are you?

380
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:57,387
My name is Darius Stone.

381
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,291
Stone?

382
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:02,029
You have half the suits in this city
looking for you.

383
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,861
Why in the world
would you come here?

384
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,366
Trust me...

385
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:08,164
...they won't look for a guy like me
in a place like this.

386
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,702
Well, no offense,
but I don't trust anybody right now.

387
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,841
Good. That means we got
something in common.

388
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:19,949
Charlie. I'm sorry I'm so late.

389
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,052
I had that urban-youth meeting.
It ran over.

390
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,347
We're trying to set up
that after-school...

391
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:27,491
...gun-instructional program
for kids and--

392
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,422
I'm sorry. Dickie Ambrose, NRA. Hi.

393
00:35:30,595 --> 00:35:33,189
Reverend Billy Bob Baker,
Southern Baptist Brotherhood.

394
00:35:33,364 --> 00:35:36,925
Well, it's just great
to meet you, Reverend.

395
00:35:37,101 --> 00:35:40,696
Hey, listen, we're setting up
this rally upstate next week...

396
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:44,501
...and I was just wondering if there
was some way we could attract...

397
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:48,475
...you know, some upstanding
African-Americans like yourself.

398
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,238
You got any advice for us?

399
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:53,714
Well, Dick, perhaps you could
tell your members...

400
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:57,116
...to stop buying country music,
stop burning crosses...

401
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,153
...and stop shooting black folks.

402
00:35:59,624 --> 00:36:00,886
Hear me?

403
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:03,393
Now, if that don't work...

404
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:05,724
...try a cookout with free food.

405
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,421
Preferably fried.

406
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,328
Dick...

407
00:36:11,235 --> 00:36:13,703
...would you mind terribly
if we rescheduled?

408
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,999
I think that would be....

409
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:19,302
Yeah, that's fine.
I have a lot of stuff to do.

410
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:21,377
- Reverend, I'll--
- Call me.

411
00:36:21,546 --> 00:36:23,377
I'll call you about that.

412
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:31,514
Tell me about you and the captain.

413
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:36,783
I was Gibbons' contact on the Hill.

414
00:36:36,961 --> 00:36:40,260
I'm an aide to the Senate
Subcommittee on Military Action.

415
00:36:40,431 --> 00:36:41,796
Military?

416
00:36:43,634 --> 00:36:44,862
Deckert.

417
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,697
Secretary of Defense Deckert?

418
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,204
There's not a bullet shot in the dark
that he don't know about.

419
00:36:50,408 --> 00:36:51,739
So tell me something, Charlie.

420
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:53,867
Can you get me close to him?

421
00:36:55,446 --> 00:36:57,243
Well, Reverend...

422
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,449
...you think you can lay your hands
on a tuxedo?

423
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,598
You made it.

424
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,736
You know, I never miss a party.

425
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,428
Not quite the tux I had in mind.

426
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,437
Yes, but I'm blending.

427
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,701
You see the guest of honor?

428
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:01,406
Those bodyguards?

429
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,639
SEAL Team Four. Half my old unit.

430
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:06,180
And not the better half.

431
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,580
Who's the ugly general
he's talking to?

432
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:11,654
Jack Pettibone.
Vice chair, Joint Chiefs.

433
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,288
- Doesn't look too happy.
- Must be the music.

434
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:16,890
One way to find out.

435
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,212
I truly can't believe
what I'm hearing.

436
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,007
We go back 30 years, Jack.

437
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:41,208
Same blood in the same mud, and you
never questioned my command.

438
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:44,513
I presume you've heard of
the United States Congress.

439
00:38:44,689 --> 00:38:46,088
Jack...

440
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,851
...this country is being led
down the wrong path.

441
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:51,187
You really think you can do this,
don't you?

442
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:52,920
With just a few regiments.

443
00:38:53,097 --> 00:38:55,895
Once we lead,
the full force will follow.

444
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,329
The clock is ticking.

445
00:38:57,968 --> 00:38:59,936
With or without you.

446
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:01,469
Three days.

447
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,843
He's here.

448
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:33,602
Black guy, white tux.

449
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:49,680
Had enough of the party?

450
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:56,624
Hold on.

451
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,305
You asked me to track down
the rest of their old troop?

452
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,138
Well, half of them are still enlisted.

453
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,907
- What about the other half?
- Gone. Missing.

454
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:23,144
The same men that backed
Stone against Deckert.

455
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,584
Every single one of them
just disappeared.

456
00:40:40,004 --> 00:40:41,869
Wait a minute. This is your home?

457
00:40:42,706 --> 00:40:45,504
Not bad for a senator's aide.

458
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:49,042
I'm not just a senator's aide.
I'm also a senator's daughter.

459
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:51,238
James Mayweather, Virginia.

460
00:40:51,415 --> 00:40:53,883
Think Daddy's ready to meet
a guy like me?

461
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:58,118
- Actually, Daddy's out of town.
- Really?

462
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:02,785
Make yourself at home, Darius.

463
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:06,125
Not a bad place to grow up, I guess.

464
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,787
Only on the surface.

465
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:11,264
Growing up in D.C. politics
is like living in a snake pit.

466
00:41:11,435 --> 00:41:13,926
Everybody fighting for territory.

467
00:41:14,104 --> 00:41:16,004
Sounds a lot like where I grew up.

468
00:41:18,876 --> 00:41:22,141
Oh, no. This is nothing like
where I grew up.

469
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,706
Let's get you out of those clothes,
shall we?

470
00:41:30,855 --> 00:41:32,288
Here we go.

471
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:34,652
Why don't you try these on.

472
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:36,886
Not really my style.

473
00:41:39,029 --> 00:41:41,930
Why don't you go ahead
and get cleaned up.

474
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,329
There's some fresh towels
in the bathroom.

475
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,265
Full-service, huh?

476
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,996
You know, if you need anything...

477
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:52,608
...I'm just right down the hall.

478
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:54,574
Anything?

479
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,507
Anything at all.

480
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,843
How about some fries and a shake?

481
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,554
The things I can't do for my country.

482
00:42:45,129 --> 00:42:46,756
Charlie?

483
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,500
Charlie.

484
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:17,789
Pettibone?

485
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:23,531
She set me up.

486
00:43:23,968 --> 00:43:25,595
Bitch.

487
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,002
This is the police.

488
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:34,042
Come out with your hands
behind your head.

489
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,606
We got the vice chair
of the Joint Chiefs in there.

490
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:39,806
The assailant is armed
and dangerous.

491
00:43:39,984 --> 00:43:42,316
Proceed with extreme caution,
gentlemen.

492
00:43:42,486 --> 00:43:46,149
Gus, get me a hostage negotiator,
clear a two-block radius...

493
00:43:46,323 --> 00:43:49,451
- ...and five is the active perimeter.
- Better make that 1 0.

494
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:51,561
Captain, the man's
a Special Forces sniper.

495
00:43:51,729 --> 00:43:54,562
Keep all fields clear
at least half a mile downwind.

496
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,064
- Who the hell are you?
- Kyle Steele, NSA.

497
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,329
Captain, I need to speak
to this man alive.

498
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,302
- So?
- It's a matter of national security, sir.

499
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,872
- Where the hell are you going?
- Going inside.

500
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:09,342
Listen, I don't care who you are.
You got six minutes till we breach.

501
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:10,975
Stone.

502
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:13,378
I'm coming in unarmed.

503
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,014
All right, close that door.

504
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,056
Hands.

505
00:44:28,265 --> 00:44:29,664
Step forward.

506
00:44:30,968 --> 00:44:33,937
How you know I wouldn't shoot you
the second you stepped through?

507
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:35,332
I didn't.

508
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,703
But I do know this: You got five
minutes till they knock that door down.

509
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,537
So let's skip the chitchat.

510
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,703
- Where's Pettibone?
- Upstairs, dead.

511
00:44:44,648 --> 00:44:46,411
- You do it?
- lf I did it...

512
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,710
...you wouldn't know
until I wanted you to.

513
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:50,751
Now, turn around.

514
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:56,858
Stone, this doesn't look
too good, man.

515
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:59,996
An escaped convict breaks into
a house with an automatic in hand...

516
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:02,428
- ...and a dead man upstairs.
- I didn't break in.

517
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:04,089
Now, move.

518
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:05,496
You didn't break in here?

519
00:45:05,669 --> 00:45:08,069
So, what, the general
invited you over for a nightcap?

520
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:10,968
What happened? You guys
felt like playing Russian roulette?

521
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,573
This is not my gun.

522
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:14,233
You expect me to buy that line?

523
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:15,844
It's not a line, it's the truth.

524
00:45:16,013 --> 00:45:17,981
- They set me up.
- Who set you up?

525
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:20,812
- Deckert.
- Deckert.

526
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,245
Secretary of Defense Deckert.

527
00:45:25,923 --> 00:45:28,221
He clipped Gibbons
when he got too close.

528
00:45:28,392 --> 00:45:30,451
And now Pettibone.

529
00:45:31,095 --> 00:45:33,222
Too close to what?

530
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:37,159
Stone, we have three minutes.
Level with me.

531
00:45:37,334 --> 00:45:39,495
Why are we here?
Why'd you go after Pettibone?

532
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,797
I didn't go after nobody.

533
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,439
I don't even know the guy.

534
00:45:43,607 --> 00:45:45,336
Never seen him before in my life.

535
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:48,938
Easy.

536
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:53,173
That sure looks a lot like you.

537
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,154
Damn, they're good.

538
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,416
Think now is really
the best time for a snack?

539
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,789
What they got out there,
three teams?

540
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:09,694
Flash-bangs, body armor,
heat-scopes. Am I close?

541
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:11,926
Stone, I wanna help you here,
I really do.

542
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,002
But if you run, you look guilty.

543
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:17,163
Brother, I was born looking guilty.

544
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,739
And now...

545
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:21,002
...it's time for you to go.

546
00:46:23,213 --> 00:46:24,908
Where is he?

547
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,547
Where is he?

548
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:32,052
Captain, I got him.
Looks like upstairs bathroom.

549
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:33,712
Okay, go get him.

550
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,431
This is the last known photograph
of the suspect.

551
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,441
- Cute picture.
- Yeah. Haircut suits you, definitely.

552
00:47:27,611 --> 00:47:29,101
--near Charlottesville, Virginia.

553
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,747
The assailant is assumed
to be armed and dangerous.

554
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:34,106
One of General Pettibone's
closest friends...

555
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,218
... was Defense Secretary
George Deckert.

556
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:39,412
Jack Pettibone
was a dear friend of mine.

557
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,253
And tonight, this nation
has lost a great patriot.

558
00:47:43,427 --> 00:47:46,794
And his quiet contributions
will be properly recorded...

559
00:47:46,964 --> 00:47:48,659
...in history books yet to be written.

560
00:47:48,832 --> 00:47:51,300
From base to base,
Camp Pendleton to Fort Bragg...

561
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,459
... General Pettibone's troops
are en route...

562
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,502
... to Washington D. C.
for the funeral.

563
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:57,435
They're not coming for the funeral.

564
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,439
Same blood, same mud.

565
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,610
Pettibone and Deckert both served
for over 30 years together.

566
00:48:02,779 --> 00:48:04,906
So that means
Pettibone's troops are also...?

567
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,447
- Deckert's.
- Correct.

568
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,346
What's that got to do
with the funeral?

569
00:48:08,518 --> 00:48:11,180
The perfect cover.
Deckert does the guest list...

570
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:12,947
...only invites his boys to town.

571
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,424
He's got his army.

572
00:48:15,592 --> 00:48:18,584
Now, he's gotta be loading up.
How would he get his gear?

573
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,126
All orders go through
his department, the DOD.

574
00:48:21,531 --> 00:48:23,021
Right.

575
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,268
You want me to hack in?

576
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,405
To the U.S. Department of Defense?

577
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:31,438
We're talking 500 acres
of hardware.

578
00:48:31,608 --> 00:48:33,405
Cray supercomputers,
encryption chips...

579
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,172
...not to mention more firewalls than
the NSA, CIA and the IRS combined.

580
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:38,974
Exactly.

581
00:48:39,149 --> 00:48:41,083
Hold my chips.

582
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:58,292
You know,
you don't have to wait up.

583
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:01,367
You think I'd leave you
alone with my car?

584
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,198
What's so special about this one?

585
00:49:07,377 --> 00:49:12,212
Shelby Cobra prototype,
600 horses, 1 0,000 rpm.

586
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:13,974
Only three off the rack.

587
00:49:14,151 --> 00:49:16,483
And we sold it for half a mil
to some senator...

588
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:18,518
...who'll never take her
out of first gear.

589
00:49:18,689 --> 00:49:20,281
Half a mil for a car?

590
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,725
You been gone a while, D.

591
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:25,987
Everything's more expensive now.

592
00:49:29,333 --> 00:49:30,732
I could see that.

593
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,897
Come here.

594
00:49:36,873 --> 00:49:39,103
You've done real good, Lo.

595
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:43,007
No rollbacks, part bins
or stripped engines.

596
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:45,045
It's a long way
from Zeke's chop shop.

597
00:49:46,116 --> 00:49:48,641
Still got a few bins in the back.

598
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:51,716
And I still get my hands dirty.

599
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,819
Classic's still a classic.

600
00:50:01,064 --> 00:50:04,693
You remember the first time
we dropped gears in this one?

601
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:09,068
I remember three squad cars
at 100-plus on the parkway.

602
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:11,264
Oh, she was fast.

603
00:50:11,808 --> 00:50:13,901
Yes, she was.

604
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:17,305
You remember all that damage
we did in the back seat?

605
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:22,012
That was a long time ago, D.

606
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:23,618
Not for me.

607
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,045
Ready to do some more damage?

608
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,419
He shoots, he scores!

609
00:50:33,597 --> 00:50:37,431
College boy just pulled off the hack
of the century. Requisition order.

610
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,126
Deckert's bringing all his troops
and armored vehicles...

611
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:43,568
...through a naval base up the
Potomac to the USS Independence.

612
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:46,499
It's an aircraft carrier, man.

613
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:49,436
Looks like we going upstate.

614
00:52:17,103 --> 00:52:20,664
Well, well. Daddy's little girl.

615
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:48,327
Look, Gibbons, people will believe--

616
00:52:48,501 --> 00:52:50,401
- Stone.
- You miss me?

617
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,299
Apparently, we all did.

618
00:52:52,472 --> 00:52:54,531
She had me fooled too.

619
00:52:55,442 --> 00:52:56,841
Captain?

620
00:53:00,247 --> 00:53:02,272
Harris? Jackson?

621
00:53:02,582 --> 00:53:05,107
- What the hell is going on here?
- It's your old unit.

622
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:08,277
And you're gonna be
joining them real soon.

623
00:53:08,555 --> 00:53:11,615
- What's she talking about?
- Deckert. He set us up.

624
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:13,918
- For what?
- I don't know. I didn't get that far.

625
00:53:14,094 --> 00:53:16,085
I was hoping maybe you did.

626
00:53:18,798 --> 00:53:20,925
- You not going nowhere.
- Neither are you.

627
00:53:26,439 --> 00:53:28,703
No, no, no. Don't worry about us.

628
00:53:29,509 --> 00:53:31,306
You know you should've
killed that bitch!

629
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:42,452
- Who triggered the alarm?
- It's Stone. He's here.

630
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,989
Liebo, get men fore and aft.
Push him down here.

631
00:54:10,383 --> 00:54:11,816
Take him out now.

632
00:54:12,686 --> 00:54:14,620
Seal the hatch!

633
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:33,503
You have green light.
Repeat, take your best shot.

634
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:37,268
Old Sergeant Cobb.
You still too dumb to make captain.

635
00:54:37,444 --> 00:54:39,674
Lieutenant Stone.
Blast from the past.

636
00:54:39,846 --> 00:54:41,279
That's "Big Daddy Stone" to you.

637
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:43,075
So tell me, how was prison?

638
00:54:43,249 --> 00:54:44,910
You'll find out soon enough.

639
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:48,543
And with a mouth like yours,
they gonna love you on the inside.

640
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:51,248
Let's go, let's go. Get him.

641
00:54:51,424 --> 00:54:53,119
Fire!

642
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:02,461
Oh, I'm sorry, was that your ride?

643
00:55:02,635 --> 00:55:04,899
No, but yours is gonna take you
straight to hell.

644
00:55:08,007 --> 00:55:09,474
Loading.

645
00:55:09,642 --> 00:55:11,439
Stand by.

646
00:55:13,913 --> 00:55:15,244
Now!

647
00:55:23,022 --> 00:55:25,490
- Goddamn it.
- Man, that wasn't even close.

648
00:55:25,658 --> 00:55:28,889
Trucks, choppers. What's next?
You gonna sink the ship?

649
00:55:29,062 --> 00:55:30,495
Only if you're still on it.

650
00:55:30,663 --> 00:55:33,427
Keep this up and you ain't gonna
have nothing left, hillbilly.

651
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,334
- Load.
- Loaded.

652
00:55:38,171 --> 00:55:40,401
You and I have unfinished
business, homeboy.

653
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:51,475
Fire.

654
00:55:57,157 --> 00:55:59,284
Move! All right, come on. Let's go!

655
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:11,264
- Hey!
- What the hell is he doing?

656
00:56:22,882 --> 00:56:25,715
Where the hell you going?
Over there. That way.

657
00:56:50,743 --> 00:56:52,677
Get that tank topside now.

658
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:57,943
Move, move.

659
00:56:59,085 --> 00:57:01,553
Bravo Squad to flight deck now.

660
00:57:20,206 --> 00:57:21,833
Locked on.

661
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:30,681
Fire now.

662
00:57:41,861 --> 00:57:43,522
Goddamn it!

663
00:58:04,183 --> 00:58:07,675
All dive teams in the water.
Lock the area down.

664
00:58:07,854 --> 00:58:10,186
Zodiac One, sweep the stern.

665
00:58:10,356 --> 00:58:13,587
Zodiac Two, starboard bow,
in the midships.

666
00:58:14,761 --> 00:58:16,854
Search Boat One
and Search Boat Two...

667
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:19,828
... widen your radius
and search the port side.

668
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:23,059
Dive Team Number Three,
report any visual.

669
00:58:25,104 --> 00:58:27,664
George, I'm addressing
the nation tonight.

670
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:30,104
So, what's the hang-up
on the new military bill?

671
00:58:30,276 --> 00:58:32,972
Well, if you're reducing troops,
closing bases...

672
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:35,671
...and cutting Rand D,
you leave us vulnerable.

673
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:38,180
George, we need to increase
international aid.

674
00:58:38,351 --> 00:58:41,445
We need to reverse
this isolationist doctrine.

675
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:46,081
Maybe then we can turn
some of these enemies into allies.

676
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:51,118
I know this doesn't particularly
thrill you, George.

677
00:58:51,297 --> 00:58:53,322
But this is going to be my legacy.

678
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,931
- Sir.
- Now, the question is:

679
00:58:58,237 --> 00:58:59,704
Do I have your support?

680
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:03,034
It goes without saying,
Mr. President.

681
00:59:12,151 --> 00:59:13,778
Call for you.

682
00:59:13,953 --> 00:59:16,478
It's about the new Lincoln
you ordered.

683
00:59:16,856 --> 00:59:19,051
- Yeah.
- Downstairs.

684
00:59:19,225 --> 00:59:21,659
Your car. Come alone.

685
00:59:39,412 --> 00:59:41,073
Take a look.

686
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:50,380
- It's a map of the Capitol.
- A military map.

687
00:59:50,556 --> 00:59:53,491
- With attack routes, targets--
- I see that.

688
00:59:54,494 --> 00:59:56,519
- Where'd you get it?
- Upstate.

689
00:59:56,696 --> 00:59:59,529
Deckert's little boy scouts
are gearing up for World War IV.

690
00:59:59,699 --> 01:00:01,690
They got tanks, choppers.

691
01:00:02,268 --> 01:00:04,236
- They got Gibbons.
- What do you mean?

692
01:00:04,537 --> 01:00:06,027
Gibbons is not dead.

693
01:00:06,572 --> 01:00:08,506
He's locked up with half my old unit.

694
01:00:08,675 --> 01:00:10,370
- Upstate?
- Correct.

695
01:00:10,543 --> 01:00:12,238
Deckert is setting them up for a fall.

696
01:00:13,046 --> 01:00:15,276
- Fall for what?
- What do you think?

697
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:18,076
This man is making a move
on the U.S. Capitol.

698
01:00:22,355 --> 01:00:23,720
See this?

699
01:00:24,824 --> 01:00:26,883
Map came from National Recon.

700
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:29,494
Yeah, Deckert's making a move.
He's running security...

701
01:00:29,662 --> 01:00:31,596
...for the State of the Union tonight.

702
01:00:31,764 --> 01:00:34,733
He's not attacking,
he's guarding these targets.

703
01:00:35,101 --> 01:00:37,001
Oh, that's beautiful.

704
01:00:37,170 --> 01:00:38,660
Perfect cover.

705
01:00:38,838 --> 01:00:40,738
He's got his old crew
suited and booted.

706
01:00:41,107 --> 01:00:43,473
Look, these boys
don't play defense.

707
01:00:43,643 --> 01:00:45,201
Just offense.

708
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:51,144
It's not enough.

709
01:00:51,317 --> 01:00:53,217
What if you're wrong?

710
01:00:57,490 --> 01:00:59,549
I was wrong.

711
01:01:00,059 --> 01:01:02,289
I thought you was more
than just another suit.

712
01:01:08,668 --> 01:01:10,431
Sir, the security detail...

713
01:01:10,837 --> 01:01:12,099
...they're all ex-military.

714
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:13,499
Yeah, I can see that.

715
01:01:13,673 --> 01:01:16,540
All of them served
with Gibbons and Stone.

716
01:01:19,278 --> 01:01:22,475
- It's Deckert's unit.
- Think we got something.

717
01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:31,380
World War IV.

718
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:34,924
Anything the Defense Department
needs to know?

719
01:01:36,796 --> 01:01:39,196
Sure it's nothing
you don't already know, sir.

720
01:01:40,767 --> 01:01:42,997
- George Deckert.
- Secretary Deckert...

721
01:01:43,169 --> 01:01:44,568
...this is Agent Steele.

722
01:01:44,737 --> 01:01:47,604
Kyle, the secretary wanted to check in
on the Gibbons case.

723
01:01:47,774 --> 01:01:50,299
I have a personal interest
in the case.

724
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:53,101
Captain Gibbons was a friend.

725
01:01:53,846 --> 01:01:57,145
Well, you can rest assured we're
doing everything we can to find him.

726
01:01:57,316 --> 01:01:59,978
- Find him?
- You know, we never did ID his body.

727
01:02:02,455 --> 01:02:05,253
Terrible thing, accident like that.

728
01:02:06,826 --> 01:02:08,726
Could happen to anyone.

729
01:02:11,464 --> 01:02:15,127
Tell me, Kyle, what did
Darius Stone say to you?

730
01:02:16,502 --> 01:02:18,766
- What do you mean?
- You were the last to talk to him...

731
01:02:18,938 --> 01:02:20,428
...before he got away.

732
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,237
He didn't say much.

733
01:02:23,409 --> 01:02:26,845
No, just a bunch of wild
conspiracy theories, that's all.

734
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,545
Sounds like Stone.

735
01:02:32,518 --> 01:02:35,749
Well, if you hear anything....

736
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,751
I'll know who to chase down.

737
01:02:41,894 --> 01:02:44,055
Sir, could you tell me something?

738
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:49,260
I've always wondered...

739
01:02:49,435 --> 01:02:52,268
...how do you pick the men
who protect the president?

740
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:54,664
Simple.

741
01:02:54,841 --> 01:02:58,299
- I choose men I can trust.
- Like Gibbons.

742
01:02:58,477 --> 01:03:01,412
Would've been good to have him
there tonight, huh, sir?

743
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:04,049
Oh, he'll be there. In spirit.

744
01:03:04,584 --> 01:03:06,017
I'm sure he will.

745
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:08,214
Good luck, sir.

746
01:03:26,572 --> 01:03:29,541
Sounds like the right bank's
running leaner than the left.

747
01:03:29,709 --> 01:03:33,042
You wanna richen her up,
you're gonna have to remap the ECU.

748
01:03:34,981 --> 01:03:37,108
- What, are you surprised?
- Yeah.

749
01:03:37,283 --> 01:03:39,080
Fact you know
how to tune up a truck.

750
01:03:39,252 --> 01:03:41,277
I didn't always wear a suit.

751
01:03:43,689 --> 01:03:45,520
- How'd you find me?
- It's my job, Darius.

752
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:48,216
I'm very good at it. Can we talk?

753
01:03:57,103 --> 01:03:58,536
You were right.

754
01:03:58,704 --> 01:04:01,229
Deckert knew Gibbons was alive.
Look at this.

755
01:04:04,844 --> 01:04:07,506
President, VP, Speaker of the House,
secretary of state.

756
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:10,615
The chain of command.
He takes them out, he's what?

757
01:04:10,983 --> 01:04:13,952
- Deckert becomes the new president.
- That's right.

758
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,983
- Cleanest revolution in history.
- Yeah.

759
01:04:18,324 --> 01:04:20,019
Why are you here?
Call the White House.

760
01:04:20,192 --> 01:04:23,161
Can't. We don't know
how deep this goes.

761
01:04:24,497 --> 01:04:25,725
So, what's your plan?

762
01:04:25,898 --> 01:04:28,958
Figure we gotta go outside the box
on this one.

763
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:37,732
How far outside the box
are you prepared to go?

764
01:04:37,910 --> 01:04:39,707
Because to get us close
to the Capitol...

765
01:04:39,879 --> 01:04:42,143
...we're gonna need
some brothers we can trust.

766
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,150
Ain't no place like home.

767
01:04:59,198 --> 01:05:01,462
Man, y'all almost had me too.

768
01:05:02,768 --> 01:05:04,395
They got jokes, man. You hear that?

769
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:07,630
- They got jokes.
- No joke.

770
01:05:07,807 --> 01:05:10,833
- We need your help.
- So why don't you go to the police?

771
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,638
- We don't trust the police.
- Heard that.

772
01:05:13,813 --> 01:05:16,145
Hold this, baby. One second.

773
01:05:16,315 --> 01:05:18,180
Man, you know we got your back.

774
01:05:18,351 --> 01:05:20,683
But this ain't got
nothing to do with us.

775
01:05:20,853 --> 01:05:23,720
This got everything to do with you.

776
01:05:23,889 --> 01:05:27,188
Don't do it for the red, white and blue,
do it for yourself.

777
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,989
Do it for the right to hack and jack
cars of the highest quality...

778
01:05:31,163 --> 01:05:34,155
...on the same block
as the White House.

779
01:05:36,302 --> 01:05:38,395
It's the American way of life, bro.

780
01:05:39,205 --> 01:05:41,230
Now, if you wanna protect
that way of life...

781
01:05:41,407 --> 01:05:44,035
...then you gotta step up
and fight for it.

782
01:05:44,210 --> 01:05:47,702
Because if Deckert takes over,
freedom won't be free for long.

783
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:56,085
- Nice speech.
- Yeah.

784
01:05:56,255 --> 01:05:59,088
The freedom part
was a bit much, though.

785
01:06:02,495 --> 01:06:06,556
I got some federal heat.
Immigration, IRS.

786
01:06:06,732 --> 01:06:09,530
Couple of homeboys
unjustly accused.

787
01:06:09,702 --> 01:06:11,693
I do this for you, you'll hook us up?

788
01:06:12,038 --> 01:06:13,938
I'll do what I can.

789
01:06:16,308 --> 01:06:17,935
Fair enough.

790
01:06:19,578 --> 01:06:22,706
All right, fellas, get your gear together.
We got some work to do.

791
01:06:22,882 --> 01:06:25,942
Janky, Kevlar panels.
Killa, super jacks.

792
01:06:26,118 --> 01:06:28,052
Dizzle, heavy-duty roll cages.

793
01:06:28,220 --> 01:06:30,780
Assholes and elbows,
gentlemen. Let's go.

794
01:06:31,157 --> 01:06:35,287
Toby. To deal with these guys,
we're gonna need some serious gear.

795
01:06:35,461 --> 01:06:37,122
Well, it's about time.

796
01:06:37,296 --> 01:06:39,389
God, I am so glad
to hear you say that, X.

797
01:06:39,565 --> 01:06:41,965
I got some stuff you're gonna love.
Laser-scope...

798
01:06:42,134 --> 01:06:43,761
...frequency lock, GPS autotracker.

799
01:06:43,936 --> 01:06:46,234
This will tell you what perfume
a chick's wearing...

800
01:06:46,405 --> 01:06:48,464
- ...from 30 miles away.
- That'll come in handy.

801
01:06:48,641 --> 01:06:51,371
So will these. Basic scramblers,
jammers, circuit jacks.

802
01:06:51,544 --> 01:06:53,808
Whatever you need.
Now, this is the house special.

803
01:06:53,979 --> 01:06:56,675
I call this one The Glove.

804
01:06:57,249 --> 01:06:58,477
So does everybody else.

805
01:06:58,651 --> 01:07:02,849
Not everybody else has electro-charge
pneumatic suction.

806
01:07:03,022 --> 01:07:04,990
Turn this bad boy on....

807
01:07:09,962 --> 01:07:11,293
See? Nothing.

808
01:07:11,464 --> 01:07:13,591
Nothing at all. Chill out
with the butt-- Don't.

809
01:07:13,766 --> 01:07:15,256
Just-- Hey, hey. Hey.

810
01:07:15,434 --> 01:07:18,562
Come on, man. Why you gotta
play around here? Hey!

811
01:07:18,737 --> 01:07:21,797
We need firepower. Do you have
anything that shoots bullets?

812
01:07:21,974 --> 01:07:23,999
I don't, but Homeland Security does.

813
01:07:24,176 --> 01:07:25,700
Lola. Come on, man, please.

814
01:07:29,381 --> 01:07:32,373
Okay. I'll just call the Pentagon
and see if they deliver.

815
01:07:32,551 --> 01:07:35,645
We don't have to. They've been
running weapons across country...

816
01:07:35,821 --> 01:07:37,254
...in civilian trucks.

817
01:07:37,423 --> 01:07:39,015
Civilian trucks?

818
01:07:43,863 --> 01:07:47,026
- Man, I'm hungry.
- You just ate five minutes ago.

819
01:07:47,333 --> 01:07:49,665
What if I go in the back
and get a slice of cheese?

820
01:07:49,835 --> 01:07:52,429
You'd stop at one slice.

821
01:07:53,172 --> 01:07:56,699
What does Homeland Defense need
with a truck full of cheese anyway?

822
01:07:56,876 --> 01:07:59,504
You ain't never heard
of government cheese?

823
01:08:06,919 --> 01:08:08,511
Let's give them a little assistance.

824
01:08:13,893 --> 01:08:17,260
- Hi, boys.
- Ladies. Look like you're overheated.

825
01:08:17,429 --> 01:08:19,989
- I know we are.
- I mean your car.

826
01:08:32,845 --> 01:08:34,540
I'm not going out without a fight.

827
01:08:35,247 --> 01:08:36,805
- He's retarded.
- Key's in the truck.

828
01:08:36,982 --> 01:08:39,644
Move the level,
because the brakes get stuck.

829
01:08:40,186 --> 01:08:42,017
Hi, I'm Agent Shavers.

830
01:08:42,188 --> 01:08:44,520
We'll be commandeering
your truck today.

831
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:47,420
Man, we can't let nobody know
a white guy hijacked us.

832
01:08:47,593 --> 01:08:49,220
We'll say it was 75 black guys.

833
01:09:08,047 --> 01:09:10,379
We got a truck full of guns,
they pay us to haul cheese?

834
01:09:10,549 --> 01:09:13,313
- That's not cheese?
- So, what you think, D-Train?

835
01:09:14,853 --> 01:09:16,115
This enough bang for you?

836
01:09:18,457 --> 01:09:19,947
God bless America.

837
01:09:34,173 --> 01:09:37,074
You're going to take the president out,
aren't you, George?

838
01:09:37,243 --> 01:09:40,974
No, captain, you are.
They pull the trigger, you take the fall.

839
01:09:41,146 --> 01:09:42,841
- No one would ever believe l--
- What?

840
01:09:43,382 --> 01:09:46,283
Augustus Gibbons
always fought the system.

841
01:09:46,452 --> 01:09:48,943
This week, that fight became a war.

842
01:09:49,888 --> 01:09:51,822
He took out his own NSA unit...

843
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:54,926
...broke a convict
out of a maximum-security prison...

844
01:09:55,094 --> 01:09:58,086
...staged his own death, ordered
the murder of Jack Pettibone...

845
01:09:58,264 --> 01:10:01,233
...and rallied his old troop
of traitors for one last stand.

846
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,799
I believe it.

847
01:10:02,968 --> 01:10:05,095
You know what
your problem is, Auggie?

848
01:10:05,271 --> 01:10:07,796
You've never been able to see
beyond the bend.

849
01:10:07,973 --> 01:10:10,840
And you've never been able to see
beyond yourself.

850
01:10:13,979 --> 01:10:16,004
You've had your hero's funeral,
Gibbons.

851
01:10:16,181 --> 01:10:21,346
This time, they're gonna bury you
in a pine box in an unmarked grave.

852
01:10:22,354 --> 01:10:23,821
I'm not buried yet.

853
01:10:24,390 --> 01:10:26,324
He's one man, captain.

854
01:10:26,492 --> 01:10:27,982
What can one man do?

855
01:10:52,885 --> 01:10:55,080
Deckert's got all the streets
locked down.

856
01:10:55,254 --> 01:10:56,721
Three blocks in every direction.

857
01:10:56,889 --> 01:10:58,652
There are some streets
he don't know about.

858
01:10:58,824 --> 01:11:00,621
At the East Capitol
and Eighth Street...

859
01:11:00,793 --> 01:11:03,762
...we use alleys and warehouses
to bust out behind the Capitol.

860
01:11:03,929 --> 01:11:06,557
- Gonna have tanks waiting.
- Leave the tanks to me.

861
01:11:06,732 --> 01:11:08,597
If it got wheels, we can jack it.

862
01:11:09,101 --> 01:11:10,363
Trust me, daddy-o.

863
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:12,595
- All right, let's roll.
- All right, gentlemen.

864
01:11:13,005 --> 01:11:15,530
Lock and load. Time to ride out.

865
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:19,109
The fate of the free world in the hands
of a bunch of hustlers and thieves.

866
01:11:19,278 --> 01:11:21,041
Why should tonight
be any different?

867
01:11:47,673 --> 01:11:50,403
As you can see behind me,
the president is just arriving....

868
01:11:50,576 --> 01:11:54,103
The nation is eager to hear the
president's stance on pressing issues.

869
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:56,372
Chief among them,
the new military bill.

870
01:12:04,623 --> 01:12:09,390
Ladies and gentlemen,
the president of the United States.

871
01:12:16,535 --> 01:12:19,766
Mr. Speaker,
my fellow Americans...

872
01:12:19,938 --> 01:12:23,465
...tonight I stand before you
to report...

873
01:12:23,642 --> 01:12:28,409
...that the state of our Union
is strong.

874
01:12:32,317 --> 01:12:35,753
We are at a critical moment
in our history.

875
01:12:36,188 --> 01:12:37,416
Nice.

876
01:12:37,589 --> 01:12:42,026
Get crunk, X. Come on, Steele,
get crunk with us.

877
01:12:47,466 --> 01:12:50,833
We now need the courage
to reevaluate...

878
01:12:51,003 --> 01:12:54,166
...the course of modern
American democracy...

879
01:12:54,339 --> 01:12:57,706
...if we are to truly flourish
and survive.

880
01:12:59,645 --> 01:13:01,943
Looks like we got a little
block party up ahead.

881
01:13:02,481 --> 01:13:04,449
- Go through it.
- Hold on.

882
01:13:16,295 --> 01:13:19,025
We must use understanding...

883
01:13:21,333 --> 01:13:22,732
...and compassion...

884
01:13:24,403 --> 01:13:27,236
- They're shooting at us.
- Welcome to the 'hood, college boy.

885
01:13:27,406 --> 01:13:30,204
...and compromise to win battles...

886
01:13:33,745 --> 01:13:36,213
...and not just the sacrifices...

887
01:13:36,381 --> 01:13:39,475
...of the lives of our
young men and women.

888
01:13:52,397 --> 01:13:53,694
Fellas...

889
01:13:53,866 --> 01:13:56,232
...I don't mean to be
a back-seat driver...

890
01:13:56,401 --> 01:13:59,893
- ...but isn't that a dead end?
- There's no such thing as a dead end.

891
01:14:29,735 --> 01:14:32,295
Now, that's what I'm talking about!

892
01:14:34,006 --> 01:14:35,234
Oh, shit.

893
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:40,274
I think you might wanna back up
right about now.

894
01:14:44,917 --> 01:14:46,544
Go, go, go.

895
01:14:49,254 --> 01:14:50,585
Everybody out now.

896
01:15:11,043 --> 01:15:13,568
- I told you they'd have tanks waiting.
- And I told you...

897
01:15:13,745 --> 01:15:15,610
...if it got wheels, we can jack it.

898
01:15:16,048 --> 01:15:18,778
Move it. Get those jacks
out of there.

899
01:15:37,269 --> 01:15:40,102
Welcome to the first
tank-jacking in history.

900
01:15:40,472 --> 01:15:42,770
We can and must endeavor...

901
01:15:42,941 --> 01:15:46,900
...to win the hearts and minds
of our enemies...

902
01:15:47,079 --> 01:15:50,048
...and turn them into our allies.

903
01:15:50,482 --> 01:15:52,507
And so, my fellow Americans...

904
01:15:52,684 --> 01:15:57,417
...I will ask you tonight
to support this new--

905
01:16:00,359 --> 01:16:02,054
- What's going on?
- We need to move you.

906
01:16:02,227 --> 01:16:05,321
Remain in your seats.
No cause for alarm.

907
01:16:06,999 --> 01:16:09,229
Okay, let's put these dubs to work.

908
01:16:12,571 --> 01:16:14,937
You sure you know
how to drive this thing?

909
01:16:18,644 --> 01:16:20,339
Just trying to get a feel for her.

910
01:16:22,014 --> 01:16:24,005
Yeah! I could get used to this.

911
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:30,587
You know, somebody
better leave a note.

912
01:16:30,756 --> 01:16:32,815
Okay, split off the vice president.

913
01:16:32,991 --> 01:16:36,654
- What are you doing?
- Just following protocol, sir.

914
01:16:49,007 --> 01:16:51,066
We're in position.

915
01:17:03,355 --> 01:17:06,085
Code red. Code red.
Small-arms fire, Capitol building.

916
01:17:06,258 --> 01:17:07,691
All units respond immediately.

917
01:17:16,068 --> 01:17:17,797
All right, Zeke, the tank is all yours.

918
01:17:18,737 --> 01:17:20,068
Hey, you know what to do.

919
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,814
I'll take lead, you lay down cover.

920
01:17:30,982 --> 01:17:32,540
What do you mean you'll take lead?

921
01:17:32,718 --> 01:17:34,879
- I'm XXX.
- Is this you, George?

922
01:17:36,088 --> 01:17:37,385
Are you doing this?

923
01:17:39,324 --> 01:17:41,417
Are you familiar
with the word "treason"?

924
01:17:41,593 --> 01:17:42,924
You're a Jefferson man.

925
01:17:43,228 --> 01:17:46,163
"The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time...

926
01:17:46,331 --> 01:17:47,764
...with the blood of patriots."

927
01:17:49,568 --> 01:17:53,561
"And tyrants."
That's the end of the quote.

928
01:17:53,739 --> 01:17:56,503
I will do whatever it takes
to keep this nation safe and strong.

929
01:17:56,675 --> 01:17:58,973
Compassion? Understanding?

930
01:17:59,144 --> 01:18:01,169
What world are you living in?

931
01:18:05,417 --> 01:18:07,112
Get rid of him.

932
01:18:08,353 --> 01:18:10,446
Okay, Zeke, do it. Do it now.

933
01:18:10,622 --> 01:18:12,419
- Let's redecorate.
- Fire in the hole.

934
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,700
Two Team, 6 o'clock.
One Team, 1 2.

935
01:18:31,676 --> 01:18:33,200
Sergeant.

936
01:18:44,456 --> 01:18:45,684
Get Gibbons up here.

937
01:18:45,857 --> 01:18:48,052
Roger that. We're on our way.

938
01:18:48,827 --> 01:18:50,055
Let's finish this.

939
01:19:02,407 --> 01:19:05,535
- Good shooting.
- Navy SEALs. High scores, Coronado.

940
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:07,143
Please. I got high score.

941
01:19:07,312 --> 01:19:09,712
But I beat them in '96.

942
01:19:10,215 --> 01:19:11,876
What, you don't read
the newsletter?

943
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:15,213
We're coming in from the southwest
halls. We'll be with you in 30--

944
01:19:22,561 --> 01:19:23,823
Drop it!

945
01:19:24,429 --> 01:19:26,397
Now! I said, drop it.

946
01:19:34,940 --> 01:19:37,204
What took you so damn long
to get here?

947
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:40,276
Same old Gibbons.
Maybe I should put this back on.

948
01:19:40,979 --> 01:19:45,177
Don't get a "thank you" or a
"happy to see you, Stone" or nothing.

949
01:19:49,321 --> 01:19:52,518
See? I told you you should have
killed that bitch.

950
01:19:55,827 --> 01:19:57,419
Bravo to Sub Team.
Bravo to Sub Team.

951
01:19:57,596 --> 01:19:59,757
We can still make this work
if we have Gibbons.

952
01:19:59,931 --> 01:20:01,831
Charlie, where the hell is he?

953
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,228
I'm right here, general.

954
01:20:03,401 --> 01:20:06,302
Checkmate in three.
You should have seen it coming.

955
01:20:06,471 --> 01:20:09,963
Give up while you still can, George.
It's over.

956
01:20:10,775 --> 01:20:12,538
Things not going according to plan?

957
01:20:17,182 --> 01:20:18,410
Sir?

958
01:20:18,583 --> 01:20:19,914
Sergeant, sidearm.

959
01:20:20,418 --> 01:20:22,511
We'll fall back to the train.

960
01:20:26,625 --> 01:20:30,618
Captain, he's got to have a backup.
What would it be?

961
01:20:31,663 --> 01:20:33,358
There's a presidential bullet train...

962
01:20:33,531 --> 01:20:35,761
...three stories down
for emergency evacuation.

963
01:20:39,704 --> 01:20:41,399
Go after him. We'll take care of this.

964
01:21:16,808 --> 01:21:18,969
- Sergeant.
- You, you, out.

965
01:21:19,144 --> 01:21:20,941
Do what he says.

966
01:21:23,548 --> 01:21:25,448
No!

967
01:21:25,617 --> 01:21:27,050
Drive.

968
01:21:35,894 --> 01:21:38,624
Toby, I need a ride. Something fast.

969
01:21:44,302 --> 01:21:47,203
Listen up. I want three Black Hawks
on that pad, ASAP.

970
01:21:47,372 --> 01:21:49,272
Clear the road. I got a car incoming.

971
01:21:49,441 --> 01:21:50,931
Stay clear of the building.

972
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:53,577
Only security and military
personnel may enter.

973
01:21:53,745 --> 01:21:56,680
Time to throw the last punch,
lieutenant. Go get him.

974
01:22:04,289 --> 01:22:05,813
Heard you needed a ride.

975
01:22:08,593 --> 01:22:12,290
All civilians, remain where you are
until cleared by security detail.

976
01:22:12,464 --> 01:22:13,726
How fast does she go?

977
01:22:14,165 --> 01:22:15,689
Let me know.

978
01:22:26,578 --> 01:22:29,706
- Yeah?
- Steele, where's that train going?

979
01:22:29,881 --> 01:22:32,850
- North-northwest. Straight up l-95.
- Got it.

980
01:22:33,018 --> 01:22:35,578
- Darius, wait a--
- He's not a big fan of waiting.

981
01:22:35,754 --> 01:22:37,551
Neither am l. Let's go.

982
01:23:40,985 --> 01:23:42,350
There it is.

983
01:23:45,924 --> 01:23:47,323
Okay, get me closer.

984
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:57,798
Faster.

985
01:24:07,545 --> 01:24:09,672
Sit down, Jim.

986
01:24:11,082 --> 01:24:13,915
Feels good, doesn't it?
To get your hands dirty?

987
01:24:14,085 --> 01:24:15,518
Fuck you.

988
01:24:19,124 --> 01:24:22,582
Okay, let's see
what half a million buys.

989
01:24:45,950 --> 01:24:47,747
I can't get a clean shot.

990
01:24:47,919 --> 01:24:50,820
Maybe you can't, but he can.

991
01:25:55,320 --> 01:25:58,756
They'll just keep coming, George.
There's no way you're gonna hide.

992
01:25:58,923 --> 01:26:03,417
Why should I hide? The man that
tried to save the president but failed?

993
01:26:03,595 --> 01:26:05,256
I'll be seen as a patriot.

994
01:26:06,331 --> 01:26:08,458
"Tried to save the president but--"
You mean--?

995
01:26:08,633 --> 01:26:10,498
A national tragedy.

996
01:26:10,668 --> 01:26:13,967
Look at it this way:
You might get your own holiday.

997
01:27:45,396 --> 01:27:47,990
Hillbilly, you need to lighten up.

998
01:27:55,039 --> 01:27:58,873
- Brakes are blown. I can't slow down.
- We won't be needing you anymore.

999
01:28:03,214 --> 01:28:04,875
Move.

1000
01:28:20,331 --> 01:28:22,731
- Okay, ready.
- All right, here we go.

1001
01:28:37,048 --> 01:28:38,709
Drop and slide, lieutenant.

1002
01:28:38,883 --> 01:28:40,748
I don't think so.

1003
01:28:58,436 --> 01:29:00,097
Can't hold it steady.

1004
01:29:01,539 --> 01:29:02,767
Down.

1005
01:29:07,779 --> 01:29:09,303
Just like old times, huh?

1006
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:12,114
Yeah. How's that jaw, general?

1007
01:29:12,283 --> 01:29:14,945
I think of you
every time I chew steak.

1008
01:29:18,322 --> 01:29:21,314
And I thought of you
every night I spent in prison.

1009
01:29:32,470 --> 01:29:34,563
Go! Run!

1010
01:29:43,714 --> 01:29:45,545
Sir...

1011
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:47,475
...you're gonna have to jump.

1012
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:21,047
Almost in.

1013
01:30:30,728 --> 01:30:32,525
I've been waiting for this
for 1 0 years.

1014
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:37,667
Well, keep waiting.

1015
01:30:45,209 --> 01:30:47,177
Your turn to do the dying, general.

1016
01:31:37,028 --> 01:31:41,863
Wars come and go,
but my soldiers stay eternal.

1017
01:31:42,033 --> 01:31:44,092
What's that you said?

1018
01:31:44,669 --> 01:31:48,127
Looks like there's a man who deserves
a presidential commendation, sir.

1019
01:31:48,306 --> 01:31:49,898
Yes.

1020
01:31:50,541 --> 01:31:51,974
And then some.

1021
01:31:52,143 --> 01:31:53,872
Yeah.

1022
01:31:54,045 --> 01:31:55,876
And then some.

1023
01:32:15,066 --> 01:32:18,126
The nation is in shock today
in the aftermath of last night's....

1024
01:32:18,302 --> 01:32:21,237
The assault on the Capitol has
reverberated around the world....

1025
01:32:21,405 --> 01:32:24,568
The death toll is unknown. Authorities
say all assailants were killed.

1026
01:32:24,742 --> 01:32:26,937
The attack was thwarted
by a joint effort...

1027
01:32:27,111 --> 01:32:29,136
...from D. C. police
and federal agencies.

1028
01:32:29,313 --> 01:32:32,077
A group of armed assailants
managed to penetrate security....

1029
01:32:32,249 --> 01:32:34,149
Sources confirm
the president is secure.

1030
01:32:34,318 --> 01:32:36,582
Secretary of Defense
George Deckert...

1031
01:32:36,754 --> 01:32:39,382
... was buried with full
military honors today.

1032
01:32:39,557 --> 01:32:42,890
Secretary Deckert lost his life
while trying to rescue the president...

1033
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:44,823
...during the attack on the Capitol.

1034
01:32:45,162 --> 01:32:47,995
He will be remembered as one
of our nation's greatest heroes.

1035
01:32:48,165 --> 01:32:49,996
I love this town.

1036
01:32:50,167 --> 01:32:53,898
Now, more than ever,
we need heroes.

1037
01:32:54,071 --> 01:32:56,096
So it is with great pride...

1038
01:32:56,273 --> 01:32:58,969
... that I bestow this
Congressional Medal of Honor...

1039
01:32:59,143 --> 01:33:02,476
...on Kyle Christopher Steele.

1040
01:33:02,647 --> 01:33:06,139
And I hold this medal
for the unknown soldier...

1041
01:33:06,317 --> 01:33:08,285
... wherever he may be.

1042
01:33:08,452 --> 01:33:10,249
For wars come and go...

1043
01:33:10,421 --> 01:33:14,482
...but my soldiers, they stay eternal.

1044
01:33:14,659 --> 01:33:17,423
Did the president just quote Tupac?

1045
01:33:17,595 --> 01:33:20,564
Son of a bitch stole my line.

1046
01:33:25,136 --> 01:33:26,364
So, what's this?

1047
01:33:28,305 --> 01:33:29,932
You out?

1048
01:33:31,609 --> 01:33:33,201
You know me, Lo.

1049
01:33:33,377 --> 01:33:37,780
I'm only good at 100-plus
with a couple of cops on my tail.

1050
01:33:37,948 --> 01:33:40,280
And you got a good life here--

1051
01:33:48,459 --> 01:33:51,792
That ought to keep me going
another nine years.

1052
01:33:54,231 --> 01:33:56,131
D...

1053
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:58,894
...how fast did she go?

1054
01:33:59,437 --> 01:34:03,806
Two-twenty, 225.

1055
01:34:05,176 --> 01:34:08,077
The second-best ride of my life.

1056
01:34:26,363 --> 01:34:28,160
D...

1057
01:34:28,332 --> 01:34:29,924
...you forgot something.

1058
01:35:03,467 --> 01:35:06,459
Sir, I've got some ideas
for the next XXX.

1059
01:35:06,637 --> 01:35:08,468
I think it's my turn to choose now.

1060
01:35:08,639 --> 01:35:11,073
Hold on, gentlemen.
I pick the agents.

1061
01:35:11,242 --> 01:35:15,508
I think we need to go
even further off the grid next time.

1062
01:35:15,679 --> 01:35:18,443
Fresh face. New model.

1063
01:35:18,616 --> 01:35:21,107
I've got the perfect candidate.
