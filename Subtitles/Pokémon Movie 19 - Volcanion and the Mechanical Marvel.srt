Hey! it takes nerve to freeze it

00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,650
Magearna, everything ok?

75
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,820
My name's ash,
and this is my pal pikachu.

76
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,620
It's nice to meet you too -

don't worry. If those guys show up
again, we'll chase them away.

Come on...
Everybody just calm down now.

Kinda like a pokéball!

86
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,210

Huh?

95
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,970
Since we're stuck together now,
might as well have fun.

96
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,230
You fell out of the sky
with these bands, remember?

97
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:02,020
Oh!

So this is your real power.

124
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,820

00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,960
(Pokémon squeak)

177
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,650
(All exclaim)

178
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:51,210
All these pokémon, they've been hurt
by humans, haven't they?

179
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,420
It worked! Thanks so much, gulpin.

180
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,810
Even after all that's happened?

181
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:52,900
After everybody's starting
to get along so well?

182
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:01,870
Hey, I really like pokémon.
I wanna protect them too.

183
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,790
If you're gonna be a pokémon trainer,

184
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:06,620
then you've gotta learn how to
make pokémon feel safe.

185
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:37,030
(Pokémon chomp food)

186
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,750
(Both giggle)

187
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,880
(Squeaks and purrs)

188
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,090
Here, go ahead and eat.

189
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:13,270
If you like it, then why don't you
say you like it?

190
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,870
Bonnie: what is that?

191
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:36,210
(Pokémon all squeal)

192
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,640
Argh!

193
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,270
(All squeal)

194
00:51:05,190 --> 00:51:07,280
(All gasp)

195
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:18,120
(All scream in pain)

196
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:24,090
Everyone!

197
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:29,590
(Grunts)

198
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,020
Huh?

199
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:47,700
(Chirrups)

200
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,280

201
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:55,700
(All gasp)

202
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:00,120
(Scream louder)

203
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,020
Manetric!

204
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:22,150
(Both moan)

205
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:32,620
(Boom)

206
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,670
(Clicks button)

207
00:52:49,710 --> 00:52:51,800
(All scream)

208
00:52:55,550 --> 00:52:57,640
(Chirrups)

209
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,110
Pika!

210
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,090
(All sigh)

211
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:45,060
(Chirrups)

212
00:53:47,510 --> 00:53:49,530
Everything's ok!

213
00:53:57,110 --> 00:54:00,620
Alva, why don't we
tell them everything?

214
00:54:00,650 --> 00:54:03,750
What an incredible creation
magearna really is!

215
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,050
(Rhythmic tick)

216
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:22,680
You don't have to remove
its soul-heart!

217
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,520
That's just as long as magearna
becomes a sphere.

218
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:27,690
Nikola said that... argh!

219
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,240
You can't! If you remove it then...

220
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,820
(Ticking stops)

221
00:54:45,410 --> 00:54:47,540
Alva, what happened?

222
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,820
(Boom)

223
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:20,370
How could you lie to me?
It wasn't for the kingdom!

224
00:56:15,370 --> 00:56:17,470
(All gasp)

225
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:45,790
(Sucks)

226
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:53,580
Huh?

227
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:34,000
In that case, it's retrieve
the soul-heart or bust!

228
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,800
(All wail)

229
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:32,700
(All grunt in agreement)

230
00:59:32,730 --> 00:59:34,830
(Jessie and James groan)

231
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,590
Both: liftoff!

232
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,310
Princess, I have
something to report.

233
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:58,810
A previously unseen design diagram
by Nikola

234
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:00,810
was found in prince rali's room.

235
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,740
Part of the wall that defends
the azoth kingdom

236
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:16,410
can seperate and turn
into a floating fortress.

237
01:00:16,450 --> 01:00:20,540
It was designed as protection
in times of an emergency.

238
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:25,920
However, an uprising broke out over
just who would claim that power.

239
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:02,440
Townsperson: what's going on?

240
01:04:21,650 --> 01:04:24,410
(All growling)

241
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,300
Both: mega wave.

242
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,670
(Pokémon grunt, cry)

243
01:04:53,430 --> 01:04:56,360
(Roaring)

244
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:11,890
(Screaming)

245
01:06:13,090 --> 01:06:15,310
(Grunting)

246
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:28,410
Greninja, let's power up!

247
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:47,050
Champit!

248
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,180
(Shrieking)

249
01:07:46,900 --> 01:07:49,160
Stop!

250
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,680
Huh?!

251
01:10:32,190 --> 01:10:34,530
Meowth, what?

252
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,820
(Pokémon screaming)

253
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:54,920
(Sighs)

254
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:10,060
(All grunting)

255
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:38,380
Quick, pikachu, use thunderbolt!

256
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:44,140
Now use electroball!

257
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,220
(Grunting, groaning)

258
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,620
Chymia!

259
01:14:58,740 --> 01:15:01,090
Volcanion, we got it!

260
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,740
(Fastener clicks)

261
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:29,990
Quick, greninja, water shuriken!

262
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,050
(Pokémon growling)

263
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,090
(Chiming)

264
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:26,340
(Pings)

265
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:12,350
(Crash)

266
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,930
(Alarm)

267
01:17:21,550 --> 01:17:23,400
(All gasp)

268
01:17:57,260 --> 01:17:59,230
Hold on!

269
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:01,310
You're out of water.

270
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:35,220
(Both grunting)

271
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:43,020
I've got it. Go for it, pikachu,
iron tail!

272
01:18:50,390 --> 01:18:52,490
Hey, thanks.

273
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,620
(Straining)

274
01:18:58,230 --> 01:19:00,330
It's moving.

275
01:19:25,260 --> 01:19:27,310
That's right.

276
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,910
Know what I think?

277
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:45,920
You should head out on your own
journey with the pokémon.

278
01:19:50,410 --> 01:19:52,710
(Crash)

279
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:19,950
Volcanion?

280
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:27,710
It is centre of the fortress,
so I do think it would be effective,

281
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:37,340
you said you're powerful enough
to level a mountain, right?

282
01:20:37,370 --> 01:20:40,260
So why not follow the plan
and blow it up from outside?

283
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:49,690
(Crash)
huh? let's hurry.

284
01:20:57,980 --> 01:21:00,070
(Crash, all gasp)

285
01:21:12,700 --> 01:21:14,800
Ok, volcanion, go get 'em!

286
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,610
Volcanion!

287
01:22:35,160 --> 01:22:37,250
Volcanion...

288
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:10,040
You've lied to us.

289
01:23:10,070 --> 01:23:12,330
You said we'd all go back together.

290
01:23:37,850 --> 01:23:40,020
Magearna?

291
01:23:40,060 --> 01:23:42,190
The nebel plateau pokémon are safe.

292
01:23:42,230 --> 01:23:44,400
Volcanion protected them.

293
01:23:45,730 --> 01:23:48,780
I wish you could hear
what I'm saying.

294
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:06,380
(Sniffing)

295
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,620
All: huh?

296
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:48,260
(All gasp)

297
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:53,350
(All gasp)

298
01:25:19,740 --> 01:25:21,830
(All gasp)

299
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:54,240
Huh?

300
01:25:57,530 --> 01:26:00,330
Volcanion?

301
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:48,250
I said I want to protect pokémon,
right?

302
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,720
I would never tell a lie.
