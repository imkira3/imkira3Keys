No, we did that yesterday.
I don't want to do that.

Don't get me started on the date.

If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

There are no good men out there.

EVE.

502
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:57,190
EVE.

503
01:05:58,570 --> 01:05:59,530
Pathetic.

504
01:06:03,100 --> 01:06:04,130
EVE.

505
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,000
EVE!

506
01:06:15,180 --> 01:06:16,150
Oh!

507
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:32,170
Huh?

508
01:06:33,530 --> 01:06:35,260
Foreign contaminant.

509
01:06:43,210 --> 01:06:45,200
There you go, little guy.

510
01:06:45,310 --> 01:06:48,150
You came a long way for a drink of water.

511
01:06:48,250 --> 01:06:50,950
Just needed someone to look after you, that's...

512
01:07:04,470 --> 01:07:06,160
We have to go back.

513
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:11,100
<i>- Auto, come down here.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

514
01:07:11,670 --> 01:07:12,640
WALL-E.

515
01:07:14,180 --> 01:07:15,340
WALL-E.

516
01:07:18,180 --> 01:07:20,980
<i>Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holo-detector.</i>

517
01:07:21,080 --> 01:07:23,810
Not necessary, Captain.
You may give it to me.

518
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,350
- You know what? I should do it myself.
- Captain.

519
01:07:28,620 --> 01:07:31,820
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

520
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:35,380
- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.

521
01:07:35,500 --> 01:07:39,260
- What are you talking about? Why not?
- That is classified, Captain.

522
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:41,660
- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?

523
01:07:41,770 --> 01:07:43,240
You don't keep a secret from the captain.

524
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,430
Give me the plant.

525
01:07:44,540 --> 01:07:46,870
- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.

526
01:07:46,970 --> 01:07:48,810
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

527
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,110
Aye, aye, sir.

528
01:07:58,020 --> 01:08:03,390
<i># Buy N Large is your superstore
We got all you need #</i>

529
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:04,620
<i>Just cut it off, will you?</i>

530
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:09,720
<i>Hey, there, autopilots.
Got some bad news.</i>

531
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:11,420
<i>Um...</i>

532
01:08:12,670 --> 01:08:14,220
<i>Operation Cleanup has,</i>

533
01:08:15,100 --> 01:08:16,570
<i>well, failed.</i>

534
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:20,240
<i>Wouldn't you know,
rising toxicity levels have made life</i>

535
01:08:20,340 --> 01:08:22,070
<i>unsustainable on Earth.</i>

536
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,140
"Unsustainable"? What?

537
01:08:24,280 --> 01:08:28,270
<i>Darn it all, we're going to have
to cancel Operation Recolonize.</i>

538
01:08:28,380 --> 01:08:29,410
<i>So,</i>

539
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:31,880
<i>just stay the course.</i>

540
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,080
<i>Um...</i>

541
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:35,180
<i>Rather than try and fix this problem,</i>

542
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:38,590
<i>it'll just be easier
for everyone to remain in space.</i>

543
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:39,850
"Easier"?

544
01:08:41,660 --> 01:08:42,630
<i>- Huh?
- Sir, time to go.</i>

545
01:08:42,730 --> 01:08:47,220
<i>Okay. I'm giving
Override Directive A 113.</i>

546
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,860
<i>Go to full autopilot.</i>

547
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,410
<i>Take control of everything,
and do not return to Earth.</i>

548
01:08:53,510 --> 01:08:55,700
<i>Repeat, do not return to Earth.</i>

549
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,340
<i>Let's get the heck out of here.</i>

550
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:04,080
Now, the plant.

551
01:09:04,190 --> 01:09:06,150
No. Wait a minute.

552
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,620
<i>Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?</i>

553
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:11,160
<i>Message received in the year 2110.</i>

554
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,660
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

555
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,790
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

556
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:20,560
Sir, orders are "do not return to Earth."

557
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:25,610
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

558
01:09:25,710 --> 01:09:29,040
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

559
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:33,140
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

560
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:34,510
Home, Auto.

561
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:38,350
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

562
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:39,750
That's all I've ever done.

563
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:43,150
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

564
01:09:43,260 --> 01:09:45,590
<i>On the Axiom you will survive.</i>

565
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:50,390
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

566
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:11,010
<i>I'm the captain of the Axiom.</i>

567
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,750
We are going home today.

01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:20,590
GO-4?

569
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,360
Hey! That's not...

570
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,020
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

571
01:10:32,310 --> 01:10:36,140
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

572
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:37,830
No!

573
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,150
Huh?

574
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,360
- EVE?
- WALL-E!

575
01:10:53,460 --> 01:10:55,120
EVE!

576
01:10:56,730 --> 01:10:57,960
- Oh!
- WALL-E, the plant!

577
01:10:58,070 --> 01:10:59,460
- WALL-E!
- Over here. Throw it.

578
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:00,530
Ahhh!

579
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:01,870
EVE!

580
01:11:03,070 --> 01:11:04,660
Give me the plant.

WALL-E!

582
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:35,300
All communications are terminated.

No! Mutiny!

Foreign contaminant.

599
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,610
Whoa!

01:13:34,450 --> 01:13:35,680
Whoa.

WALL-E.

602
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:04,910

Ah!

641
01:18:00,750 --> 01:18:01,840
Halt.

Halt, halt.

646
01:18:20,870 --> 01:18:23,200
<i>- Look what I got, Auto.
- Not possible.</i>

647
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:26,860
That's right. The plant.

648

<i>You want it? Come and get it, blinky.</i>

649

01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:38,420
Captain? Captain?

651
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:43,550
Let go.

652
01:18:44,460 --> 01:18:46,520
- Let go.
- Too heavy for you? Huh?

653
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:50,060
Get off.

654
01:18:50,160 --> 01:18:51,820
You're not getting away
from me, one-eye.

655
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,900
- Get off.
- Is that all you got?

656
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,140
Halt.

657
01:19:12,950 --> 01:19:14,720
- That's it. A little closer.
- Cease and desist.

658
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:16,760
- Not good.
- Got you.

659
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:43,440
Whoa!

660
01:19:53,490 --> 01:19:56,490
Remain calm. Remain calm.

661
01:20:06,970 --> 01:20:10,030
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,

Ah!

665
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:24,680
Enough.

666
01:20:30,330 --> 01:20:31,890
Hey. What? John?

667
