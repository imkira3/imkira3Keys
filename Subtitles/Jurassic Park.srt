1
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:27,962
- Everybody, heads up!
- Keep it clear, now.

2
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,422
Keep it clear!

3
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,341
Stand back!

4
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:38,347
Bring it forward,
come on!

5
00:01:44,396 --> 00:01:45,688
Slow it down!

6
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,534
Pushing team, move in there.
Move in.

7
00:01:59,745 --> 00:02:02,955
On your ready.
I want Tasers on full charge.

8
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,460
- Steady!
- Go on. Step back in.

9
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,378
Ready. Move it.

10
00:02:10,714 --> 00:02:12,048
And push.

11
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:21,474
Locked. Loading team,
step away.

12
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,809
Move it.

13
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,443
Jophery, raise the gate.

14
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:52,797
- Block the opening!
- Don't let her get out!

15
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,599
Somebody help him!

16
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,685
Work her back!

17
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,531
Shoot her!

18
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,071
I heard that Hammond's
not even here.

19
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,406
He sends his apologies.

20
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,576
There's a $20 million lawsuit
by the family of that worker

21
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,245
and you're telling me
that Hammond can't see me?

22
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,457
He had to leave early, his
daughter's getting a divorce.

23
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,585
I understand, but we need to
deal with the situation now.

24
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,837
The insurance company...
You okay?

25
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:21,886
The underwriters feel that the accident's
raised safety questions about the park.

26
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,555
That makes the investors
very anxious.

27
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,225
I had to promise to conduct a very
thorough, on-site inspection.

28
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,480
Hammond hates inspections.
They slow everything down.

29
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,273
I need to or they'll
pull the funding.

30
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,233
That'll slow him down
even more.

31
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:43,157
Watch your head.

32
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:47,036
If two experts sign off
on the island,

33
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,579
the insurance guys
will back off.

34
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,124
I've already got Ian Malcolm,
but they think he's too trendy.

35
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:53,793
They want Alan Grant.
Grant?

36
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,128
You'll never get him
out of Montana.

37
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,130
Why not?

38
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,384
Why not?

39
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,721
Because Grant's like me.

40
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:09,058
He's a digger.

41
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:56,522
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler,
we're ready to try again.

42
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:59,400
I hate computers.

43
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,360
The feeling's mutual.

44
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,543
Take a look.

45
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:21,672
Did it work?

46
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:23,257
How long
does this take?

47
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,842
Should bring
an immediate return.

48
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,385
You shoot the radar
into the ground,

49
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:29,013
and the bone bounces
the image back.

50
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:31,182
Bounces it back...

51
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:35,311
This new program
is incredible.

52
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:39,356
A few more years' development, and
we won't even have to dig any more.

53
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,150
Where's the fun in that?

54
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:45,237
It's a little distorted, but I
don't think it's the computer.

55
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,450
Post-mortem contraction of the
posterior neck ligaments.

56
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:51,118
Velociraptor?

57
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:52,745
Yes. Good shape, too.

58
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:56,248
It's five, six feet high.
I'm guessing nine feet long.

59
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,666
Look...
What'd you do?

60
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,085
He touched it.

61
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:01,253
Dr. Grant's not
machine-compatible.

62
00:07:01,338 --> 00:07:03,130
Hell, they've got it
in for me.

63
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:06,717
And look at the half-moon
shaped bones in the wrists.

64
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,470
It's no wonder these guys
learned how to fly.

65
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:12,681
No, seriously.

66
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:19,605
Maybe dinosaurs have more in common with
present-day birds than with reptiles.

67
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,192
Look at the pubic bone, turned
backward, just like a bird.

68
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:27,571
Look at the vertebrae, full of air
sacs and hollows, like a bird.

69
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,783
And even the word "Raptor"
means "bird of prey."

70
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,160
That doesn't
look very scary.

71
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,456
More like a 6-foot turkey.

72
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,293
A turkey?

73
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:46,132
Imagine yourself in
the Cretaceous period.

74
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,424
Here we go.

75
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:51,679
You'd get your first look at this
6-foot turkey as you enter a clearing.

76
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,974
He moves like a bird,
lightly bobbing his head.

77
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,478
You keep still because you think maybe
his visual acuity is based on movement,

78
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:02,314
like T-Rex and he'll lose
you if you don't move.

79
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,525
But no, not Velociraptor.

80
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:08,946
You stare at him and he
just stares right back.

81
00:08:09,698 --> 00:08:11,115
And that's when
the attack comes.

82
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,285
Not from the front,
but from the side.

83
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:18,706
From the other two Raptors you
didn't even know were there.

84
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,209
Because Velociraptor's
a pack hunter.

85
00:08:22,294 --> 00:08:24,920
He uses coordinated
attack patterns

86
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,423
and he is out
in force today.

87
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:30,926
And he slashes at you
with this,

88
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:35,514
a 6-inch retractable claw, like
a razor, on the middle toe.

89
00:08:35,724 --> 00:08:39,643
He doesn't bother to bite
your jugular like a lion. No.

90
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,854
He slashes at you

91
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,523
here or here...

92
00:08:44,816 --> 00:08:45,983
Alan.

93
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,321
Or maybe across the belly,
spilling your intestines.

94
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:56,577
The point is, you are alive
when they start to eat you.

95
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,582
So, you know, try to
show a little respect.

96
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,500
Okay.

97
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:13,510
Alan, if you wanted
to scare the kid,

98
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:15,679
you could've pulled
a gun on him.

99
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:18,265
Yeah, I know. Kids.

100
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,101
You want to have
one of those?

101
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,895
I don't want that kid,

102
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,148
but a breed of the child
could be intriguing.

103
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,901
I mean, what's so
wrong with kids?

104
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:33,405
They're noisy, they're messy,
they're expensive.

105
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,990
Cheap, cheap.

106
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,492
They smell.

107
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,244
They don't smell!
Some smell.

108
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,621
Give me a break!
Babies smell.

109
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:50,256
Cover the site!
Cover up the dig!

110
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,590
Tell them to shut down!

111
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:52,925
Cut the machine!

112
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,594
- Cover it all up.
- Pull it over.

113
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:01,016
Just cut it, will you?
Shut it down!

114
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:02,851
What?

115
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,661
What the hell do you think
you're doing in here?

116
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:22,871
We were saving that.

117
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,874
For today, I guarantee it.

118
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:29,295
Who in God's name
do you think you are?

119
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:30,462
John Hammond.

120
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,924
And I'm delighted to meet you
finally in person, Dr. Grant.

121
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,972
So, I can see that my $50,000
a year has been well spent.

122
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,890
Who's the jerk?

123
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,101
This is our paleobotanist,
Dr...

124
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,394
Sattler.

125
00:10:45,687 --> 00:10:47,771
Ellie, this is Mr. Hammond.

126
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,233
I'm sorry about the dramatic entrance, Dr.
Sattler, but...

127
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,319
Did I say "jerk"?
...we're in a hurry.

128
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:56,822
Will you have a drink?
We won't let it get warm. Sit down.

129
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,659
Let me have this.
I'll just get a glass or two. I can do it.

130
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,286
There's samples
all over here.

131
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,996
I know my way
around the kitchen.

132
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,248
Now, I'll get right
to the point.

133
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:10,169
I like you.
Both of you.

134
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:13,839
I can tell instantly
about people. It's a gift.

135
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,095
I own an island off the
coast of Costa Rica.

136
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,183
I've leased it from the government
and during the last five years,

137
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,769
I've been setting up
a biological preserve.

138
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,229
Really spectacular.
Spared no expense.

139
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:32,775
Make the one I've got down in
Kenya look like a petting zoo.

140
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:37,029
And there's no doubt our attractions
will drive kids out of their minds.

141
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,614
And what are those?

142
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,491
Small versions of
adults, honey.

143
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,493
And not just kids, everyone.

144
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:45,913
We're going to open next year, if
the lawyers don't kill me first.

145
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,499
I don't care for lawyers,
do you?

146
00:11:49,084 --> 00:11:51,919
I don't really know any.
Don't really know any.

147
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:57,091
I do, there's a particular pebble in
my shoe, who represents my investors.

148
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,177
Says that they insist
on outside opinions.

149
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,887
What kind of opinions?

150
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:05,015
Well, your kind, not to put
too fine a point on it.

151
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,186
Let's face it, in your particular
fields, you're the top minds.

152
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:11,730
And if I could just
persuade you

153
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,359
to sign off on the park,
give it your endorsement,

154
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:19,863
maybe even pen a wee testimonial,
I could get back on schedule.

155
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:23,409
Why would they care
what we think?

156
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,077
What kind of park
is this?

157
00:12:27,622 --> 00:12:29,331
It's right up your alley.

158
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:35,421
Why don't you come down, just the
pair of you, for the weekend?

159
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,674
I'd love to have an opinion
of a paleobotanist as well.

160
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,677
I've got a jet
standing by at Choteau.

161
00:12:43,638 --> 00:12:45,973
I'm sorry.
This isn't possible.

162
00:12:46,808 --> 00:12:48,434
We just dug up
a new skeleton...

163
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:52,604
I could compensate you
by fully funding your dig...

164
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,691
This is a very unusual time.
The timing is...

165
00:12:55,817 --> 00:12:58,152
for a further
three years.

166
00:13:03,158 --> 00:13:04,616
Where's the plane?

167
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:07,119
Okay.
Three years.

168
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,495
Cheers.

169
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,039
Dodgson!

170
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:02,007
You shouldn't use my name.

171
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,844
Dodgson. We've got
Dodgson here.

172
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,681
See, nobody cares.
Nice hat.

173
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,101
What're you trying to look
like, a secret agent?

174
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:14,937
Well?
$750,000.

175
00:14:15,522 --> 00:14:17,940
On delivery, $50,000 more
for each viable embryo.

176
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:21,109
That's $1.5 million if you get
all 15 species off the island.

177
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:22,277
I'll get them all.

178
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:26,281
Remember, viable embryos.
They're no use to us if they don't survive.

179
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,617
How am I supposed
to transport them?

180
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:34,122
The bottom screws open.

181
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,459
That's great.
Oh, my God.

182
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,045
It's cooled and
compartmentalized inside.

183
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,672
You guys.
That's great.

184
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,382
Customs can even check it
if they want to.

185
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,967
Let me see.
Go on.

186
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:47,678
There's enough coolant
for 36 hours.

187
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,929
No menthol?

188
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:52,057
The embryos have to be back
here in San José by then.

189
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,892
That's up to your guy
on the boat.

190
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,646
7:00 tomorrow night on the East Dock.
Make sure he gets it right.

191
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,731
How are you planning
to beat security?

192
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:01,942
I've got
an 18-minute window.

193
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:05,988
Eighteen minutes and your company
catches up on 10 years of research.

194
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,119
Don't get cheap on me,
Dodgson.

195
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,665
That was Hammond's mistake.

196
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:33,348
So you two
dig up dinosaurs?

197
00:15:35,852 --> 00:15:37,769
Well...
We try to.

198
00:15:43,985 --> 00:15:46,695
You'll have to get
used to Dr. Malcolm.

199
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,615
He suffers from a deplorable
excess of personality,

200
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,199
especially for
a mathematician.

201
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,160
Chaotician. Chaotician,
actually.

202
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:55,037
John doesn't subscribe
to chaos,

203
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:57,623
particularly what it says
about his science project.

204
00:15:57,707 --> 00:16:01,418
Ian, you've never been able to
sufficiently explain your concerns...

205
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,379
Because of the behavior
of the system in phase space?

206
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,716
A load, if I may say so, of
fashionable number crunching...

207
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,051
Don't.

208
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:12,220
Dr. Sattler, Dr. Grant,
you've heard of Chaos Theory?

209
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,513
No.

210
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:14,890
No? Non-linear equations?

211
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,726
Strange attractors?

212
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:24,483
I refuse to believe that you aren't
familiar with the concept of attraction.

213
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:31,865
I bring scientists.
You bring a rock star.

214
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,412
There it is.

215
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:07,484
Bad wind shears.
We have to drop pretty fast.

216
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,028
Hold on, this will
be thrilling.

217
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,475
But you need that piece over
here, and that piece...

218
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,311
We'll have landed
by the time you get it right.

219
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,522
Great.

220
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,478
The full 50 miles of perimeter
fence are in place?

221
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,773
And the concrete moats, and the
motion-sensor tracking systems.

222
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:13,068
Donald, dear boy, relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.

223
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:16,238
Let's get this straight.
This is not a weekend excursion.

224
00:19:16,364 --> 00:19:19,407
This is a serious investigation
of the stability of the island.

225
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:22,369
Your investors, whom I represent,
are deeply concerned.

226
00:19:22,453 --> 00:19:25,956
Forty-eight hours from now, if they're
not convinced, I'm not convinced.

227
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:27,791
I'll shut you down, John.

228
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:32,420
In 48 hours, I'll be
accepting your apologies.

229
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,224
All right, slow down.
Slow. Stop!

230
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,103
This shouldn't be here.

231
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,750
Alan, this species of
Veriforman has been extinct

232
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,587
since the Cretaceous Period.
I mean, this thing...

233
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:15,005
What?

234
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,952
Look at that.

235
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,333
It's a dinosaur.

236
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,007
You did it. Crazy son
of a bitch, you did it.

237
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:04,012
We could tear up the rule book on
cold-bloodedness. It doesn't apply.

238
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,431
They're wrong. This is
a warm-blooded creature.

239
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,016
This thing doesn't
live in a swamp.

240
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,226
This thing's got
a 25, 27-foot neck?

241
00:21:10,311 --> 00:21:11,728
The Brachiosaurus? 30.

242
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:12,854
Thirty feet.

243
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:32,040
We're gonna make
a fortune with this place.

244
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:38,380
How fast are they?

245
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,716
Well, we clocked the T-Rex
at 32 miles an hour.

246
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,928
T-Rex?

247
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:48,014
You said you've got a T-Rex?

248
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,183
Say again.

249
00:21:51,352 --> 00:21:52,727
We have a T-Rex.

250
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:56,773
Put your head
between your knees.

251
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,441
Dr. Grant,

252
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,860
my dear Dr. Sattler,

253
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:04,447
welcome to Jurassic Park.

254
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:29,848
They're moving in herds.

255
00:22:32,101 --> 00:22:33,685
They do move in herds.

256
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,361
How did you do this?

257
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,490
I'll show you.

258
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,641
Good day.

259
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,062
The most advanced amusement
park in the entire world,

260
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,940
incorporating all
the latest technologies.

261
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,319
And I'm not talking just about rides.
Everybody has rides.

262
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,656
No, we've made living biological
attractions so astounding

263
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:32,327
that they'll capture the
imagination of the entire planet.

264
00:23:32,703 --> 00:23:34,496
So, what are you thinking?

265
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,082
That we're out of a job.

266
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,833
Don't you mean "extinct"?

267
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,762
Why don't you all sit down?
Donald, sit down.

268
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,724
Here he comes.
Well, here I come.

269
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,605
Hello.

270
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,774
Say hello.

271
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,025
Hello.

272
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,361
Hello, John.

273
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,822
Yes, I've got lines.

274
00:24:08,906 --> 00:24:12,367
Well, fine, I guess.
But, how did I get here?

275
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,372
Well, let me show you.
First, I'll need a drop of blood.

276
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:19,207
Your blood.

277
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:20,542
Right.

278
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,378
That hurt.

279
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:26,881
Relax, John. It's all part
of the miracle of cloning.

280
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,050
Hello, John.

281
00:24:31,053 --> 00:24:32,303
Cloned from what?

282
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:35,098
Loy extractions never recreated
an intact DNA strand.

283
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:37,267
Not without massive
sequence gaps.

284
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,269
Paleo-DNA,
from what source?

285
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:43,398
Where do you get 100
million-year-old dinosaur blood?

286
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,404
What? What?

287
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,116
Well, Mr. DNA,
where did you come from?

288
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,576
From your blood.

289
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,955
Just one drop of your blood contains
billions of strands of DNA,

290
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,583
the building blocks of life.

291
00:25:02,293 --> 00:25:06,963
A DNA strand like me is a blueprint
for building a living thing.

292
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:12,302
And sometimes animals that went extinct
millions of years ago, like dinosaurs,

293
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:17,640
left their blueprints behind for us to find.
We just had to know where to look.

294
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:22,645
A hundred million years ago, there
were mosquitoes just like today.

295
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:26,107
And just like today, they fed
on the blood of animals.

296
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:30,945
Even dinosaurs. Sometimes,
after biting a dinosaur,

297
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,783
mosquitoes would land on the branch
of a tree and get stuck in the sap.

298
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:40,997
After a long time, the tree sap would
get hard and become fossilized,

299
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:46,002
just like a dinosaur bone,
preserving the mosquito inside.

300
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:50,298
This fossilised tree sap,
which we call amber,

301
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:54,886
waited for millions of years
with the mosquito inside

302
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,056
until Jurassic Park
scientists came along.

303
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,100
Using sophisticated
techniques,

304
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,269
they extract
the preserved blood

305
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:07,690
from the mosquito,
Dino DNA!

306
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:13,029
A full DNA strand contains
three billion genetic codes.

307
00:26:13,656 --> 00:26:17,742
If we looked at screens like these
once a second for eight hours a day,

308
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:21,996
it'd take two years to look
at the entire DNA strand.

309
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:26,751
It's that long.
Since it's so old, it's full of holes.

310
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:30,046
Now that's where our
geneticists take over.

311
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,217
Thinking machine super-computers
and gene sequencers

312
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:36,469
break down the strand
in minutes.

313
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,596
And virtual-reality displays

314
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,849
show our geneticists the gaps
in the DNA sequence.

315
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:44,936
We used the complete
DNA of a frog

316
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,940
to fill in the holes
and complete the code.

317
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:53,695
Whew! And now,
we can make a baby dinosaur.

318
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,783
This score
is only temporary.

319
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,910
It all has very dramatic
music, of course.

320
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:04,080
A march or something.
It hasn't been written yet.

321
00:27:04,206 --> 00:27:06,082
And then, the tour moves on.

322
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:20,346
- Well, look here.
- Those hard-working cowpokes you see behind us...

323
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:22,807
This is overwhelming, John.

324
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:27,145
Are these characters
autoerotica?

325
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,897
No, we have no
animatronics here.

326
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:33,359
Those people are the real miracle
workers of Jurassic Park.

327
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,654
In unfertilized emu
or ostrich eggs.

328
00:27:37,448 --> 00:27:40,408
Wait a minute. How do you
interrupt the cellular mitosis?

329
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,993
Can't we see
the unfertilized eggs?

330
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,202
Shortly.

331
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:48,249
Now a whole team of genetic
engineers goes to work on...

332
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,542
Can't you stop
these things?

333
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:51,711
I'm sorry.
It's kind of a ride.

334
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:53,755
One, two, three.

335
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,550
- You can't do that.
- What?

336
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,093
Can they do that?

337
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,806
The boat
for the mainland

338
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,017
will be leaving at 1900.

339
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:11,022
All personnel be at the dock no
later than 1845. No exceptions.

340
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,524
Good day, Henry.

341
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:14,942
Good day, sir.

342
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,583
It's turning the eggs.

343
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,299
Perfect timing. I'd hoped they'd hatch
before I had to go to the boat.

344
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,843
Henry, why
didn't you tell me?

345
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:44,972
I insist on being here
when they're born.

346
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,101
Come on.

347
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,312
Come on, little one.

348
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,028
Come on, then.

349
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,200
Very good. Push.

350
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,329
- Very good.
- God.

351
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,832
Push. Come on.

352
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:14,335
Come on. Come on, then.

353
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,463
There you are.

354
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:25,888
They imprint on the first creature
they come in contact with.

355
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:28,891
That's it.
Helps them to trust me.

356
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:34,522
I've been present for the birth of
every little creature on this island.

357
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:38,818
Surely not the ones
that have bred in the wild?

358
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:41,237
Actually they can't
breed in the wild.

359
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:44,157
Population control is one
of our security precautions.

360
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:47,201
There's no unauthorized
breeding in Jurassic Park.

361
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,621
How do you know
they can't breed?

362
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:55,209
Because all the animals
in Jurassic Park are female.

363
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,670
We've engineered them
that way.

364
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,380
There you are.

365
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:04,427
- Oh, my God.
- Look at that.

366
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:08,139
Blood temperature seems
like about high 80s, maybe.

367
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:09,348
Wu?

368
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,725
Ninety-one.

369
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,935
Homoeothermic?
It holds that temperature?

370
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,103
Yes.

371
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:21,611
But, again, how do you know
they're all female?

372
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:25,781
What, does somebody go out in the park
and pull up the dinosaurs' skirts?

373
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:29,327
We control their chromosomes.
It's really not that difficult.

374
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:31,996
All vertebrate embryos are
inherently female, anyway.

375
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,750
They just require an extra hormone
given at the right developmental stage

376
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,959
to make them male.

377
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,503
We simply deny them that.

378
00:30:38,587 --> 00:30:39,921
Deny them that?

379
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:43,716
John, the kind of control you're
attempting is not possible.

380
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,761
If there's one thing the history
of evolution has taught us,

381
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,554
it's that life will
not be contained.

382
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,307
Life breaks free.
Expands to new territories

383
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:54,977
and it crashes through barriers,
painfully, maybe even dangerously,

384
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:57,772
but there it is.

385
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,775
There it is.

386
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,280
You're implying that a group composed
entirely of female animals will breed?

387
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,785
No, I'm simply saying
that life finds a way.

388
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,877
What species is this?

389
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,548
It's a Velociraptor.

390
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,220
You bred Raptors?

391
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:48,114
Dr. Grant! As I was saying, we laid on
lunch for you before you go into the park.

392
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,284
Our gourmet chef, Alejandro...
What are they doing?

393
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,249
Feeding them.

394
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:08,259
Alejandro's prepared a delightful menu for us.
Chilean sea bass, I believe.

395
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,803
Shall we?

396
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:52,803
They should all be destroyed.

397
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,890
Robert Muldoon.
My game warden from Kenya.

398
00:32:56,016 --> 00:32:58,976
Bit of an alarmist, but knows
more about Raptors than anyone.

399
00:32:59,061 --> 00:33:00,978
What's their growth rate?

400
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,689
They're lethal at eight
months, and I do mean lethal.

401
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:07,276
I've hunted most things that can
hunt you, but the way these move...

402
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:09,362
Fast for a biped?
Cheetah speed.

403
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:12,490
Fifty, sixty miles per hour if
they ever got out in the open.

404
00:33:12,574 --> 00:33:14,325
And they're
astonishing jumpers.

405
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,703
Yes. That's why we're taking
extreme precautions.

406
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,499
Do they show intelligence?
Was their brain cavity...

407
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,292
They show extreme
intelligence.

408
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,836
Even problem-solving
intelligence.

409
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:27,505
Especially the big one.

410
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:30,007
We bred eight originally,
but when she came in,

411
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:33,511
she took over the pride and
killed all but two of the others.

412
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:39,225
That one, when she looks at you, you
can see she's working things out.

413
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,770
That's why we have to
feed them like this.

414
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:45,856
She had them all attacking the
fences when the feeders came.

415
00:33:45,941 --> 00:33:47,775
The fences are electrified,
right?

416
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:51,028
That's right, but they never
attack the same place twice.

417
00:33:51,113 --> 00:33:54,782
They were testing the fences for
weaknesses, systematically.

418
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,743
They remember.

419
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:11,799
Yes. Well, who's hungry?

420
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,176
More adventurous guests,
of course,

421
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,886
can opt for our
jungle river cruise

422
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:18,389
or for a close-up look
at our majestic...

423
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,726
None of these attractions are
ready yet, but the park will open

424
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:26,147
with the basic tour you are about to take,
and then other rides will come on-line

425
00:34:26,273 --> 00:34:27,606
six or twelve months
after that.

426
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,900
Absolutely spectacular
designs.

427
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,193
Spared no expense.

428
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:33,237
And we can charge
anything we want.

429
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,073
$2,000 a day, $10,000 a day,
and people will pay it.

430
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:37,825
And there's
the merchandise...

431
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,993
Donald.

432
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,747
This park was not built to
cater only for the super rich.

433
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,833
Everyone in the world has the
right to enjoy these animals.

434
00:34:45,959 --> 00:34:50,504
Sure. They will.
We'll have a coupon day or something.

435
00:34:55,427 --> 00:35:00,306
The lack of humility before nature
that's being displayed here staggers me.

436
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:04,769
Thank you. But things are a little
different than you and I had feared.

437
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,270
I know.
They're a lot worse.

438
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:09,607
Now, wait a second, we haven't
even seen the park yet...

439
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:14,612
Donald, let him talk. There's no reason,
I want to hear every viewpoint.

440
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:19,950
Don't you see the danger, John,
inherent in what you're doing here?

441
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:22,620
Genetic power's the most awesome
force the planet's ever seen

442
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:25,539
but you wield it like a kid
that's found his dad's gun.

443
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,792
It's hardly appropriate
to start hurling...

444
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:29,168
If I may.

445
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:32,963
I'll tell you the problem with the
scientific power you're using here.

446
00:35:33,048 --> 00:35:36,050
It didn't require
any discipline to attain it.

447
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:40,679
You read what others had done,
and you took the next step.

448
00:35:40,764 --> 00:35:43,098
You didn't earn the
knowledge for yourselves

449
00:35:43,183 --> 00:35:46,227
so you don't take
any responsibility for it.

450
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,480
You stood on the shoulders
of geniuses to accomplish

451
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:50,731
something as fast
as you could.

452
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:55,152
Before you even knew what you had,
you patented it, and packaged it

453
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:58,322
and slapped it on a plastic lunch
box, now you're selling it.

454
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,157
You're going to sell it.

455
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,910
I don't think you're
giving us our due credit.

456
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:06,413
Our scientists have done things
which nobody has ever done before.

457
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:09,750
But your scientists were so
preoccupied with whether they could,

458
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,086
they didn't stop to
think if they should.

459
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:16,090
Condors. Condors are
on the verge of extinction.

460
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,052
If I was to create a flock of
condors on this island,

461
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,679
you wouldn't have
anything to say.

462
00:36:21,763 --> 00:36:24,515
Hold on, this isn't some
species that was obliterated

463
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,768
by deforestation or
the building of a dam.

464
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:32,731
Dinosaurs had their shot and nature
selected them for extinction.

465
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:38,946
I don't understand this Luddite attitude.
Especially from a scientist.

466
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:43,951
How can we stand in the light
of discovery and not act?

467
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,494
What's so great
about discovery?

468
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,705
It's a violent,
penetrative act,

469
00:36:47,789 --> 00:36:51,417
that scars what it explores.
What you call discovery,

470
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,212
I call the rape of
the natural world.

471
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:59,884
The question is, how can you know
anything about an extinct eco-system?

472
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:03,137
And therefore, how could you ever
assume that you can control it?

473
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:06,223
You have poisonous plants
in this building.

474
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,766
You picked them
because they look good.

475
00:37:07,851 --> 00:37:11,937
But these are aggressive living things
that have no idea what century they're in

476
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:15,190
and they'll defend themselves.
Violently, if necessary.

477
00:37:17,527 --> 00:37:20,404
Dr. Grant, if there's
one person here

478
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,364
who could appreciate
what I am trying to do...

479
00:37:24,326 --> 00:37:29,038
The world has just changed so radically
and we're all running to catch up.

480
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:34,335
I don't want to jump to any
conclusions, but dinosaurs and man,

481
00:37:34,461 --> 00:37:38,589
two species separated by 65
million years of evolution

482
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:42,134
have just been suddenly thrown
back into the mix together.

483
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:46,639
How can we possibly have the
slightest idea what to expect?

484
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,934
I don't believe it.

485
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:53,312
You're meant to come here and
defend me against these characters

486
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:57,066
and the only one I've got on my
side is the blood-sucking lawyer.

487
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:58,859
Thank you.

488
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,034
They're here.

489
00:38:08,036 --> 00:38:10,829
You four are gonna have a spot
of company out in the park.

490
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,707
Spend a little time
with our target audience.

491
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,377
- Grandpa!
- Kids!

492
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,048
Wait! Careful with me.

493
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:22,132
We missed you.

494
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:23,384
Me, too.

495
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,970
We loved the presents.
They were great.

496
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,179
Did you enjoy
the helicopter?

497
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,932
Yeah, it went down
and we all went right up.

498
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:36,397
- Now, kids, come away.
- Not too close to the cars.

499
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,943
Aren't they lovely?
Aren't they glorious, though?

500
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:43,529
These will be your transports
for the afternoon.

501
00:38:43,613 --> 00:38:44,655
No drivers?

502
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,657
No. No drivers.
They're electric.

503
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,493
They run on this track in the
middle of the roadway here.

504
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:52,663
Totally non-polluting.
Top of the line. Spared no expense.

505
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,498
It's an interactive CD-ROM!

506
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:58,419
You touch the right part of the screen
and it talks about whatever you want.

507
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:01,588
Lex, you're all right in there.
Dr. Sattler, come with me.

508
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:03,590
Dr. Grant, come in
the second car.

509
00:39:03,717 --> 00:39:06,260
I'm gonna ride
with Dr. Sattler.

510
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,481
I read your book.

511
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,276
That's great.

512
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:27,448
Do you really think dinosaurs turned
into birds and that's where they went?

513
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:31,285
A few species may have
evolved along those lines.

514
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:39,126
Because they sure don't
look like birds to me.

515
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:42,796
I heard that there
was this meteor,

516
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:47,176
hit the earth someplace down in
Mexico, and made this big crater.

517
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:49,219
Listen...

518
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,429
Tim.

519
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:53,682
Tim, which car
were you planning on?

520
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,269
Whichever one you are.

521
00:39:59,898 --> 00:40:04,860
Then I heard about this thing in Omni
about this meteor making all this heat.

522
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:07,780
It made diamond dust
and that changed the weather.

523
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,406
They died because
of the weather.

524
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:13,827
My teacher tells me about this book
by a guy named Bakker. He says...

525
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:19,124
She said I should ride with you
'cause it'd be good for you.

526
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,210
The boat is now loading.

527
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:26,006
Everyone must be on the dock
for the 1900 departure.

528
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:30,344
National Weather Service
is tracking a tropical storm

529
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,721
about 75 miles west of us.

530
00:40:33,515 --> 00:40:35,307
Why didn't I build
in Orlando?

531
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,186
I'll keep an eye on it.
Maybe it'll swing south like the last one.

532
00:40:43,525 --> 00:40:45,484
Ray, start the tour program.

533
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,870
Hold onto your butts.

534
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:09,174
And why did they put
the fiberglass thing?

535
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,552
I know.

536
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,229
You want to
join the future, right?

537
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,731
God help us when
the hands of engineers...

538
00:41:24,858 --> 00:41:26,150
During your tour,

539
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,693
the appropriate
information will be

540
00:41:27,777 --> 00:41:30,070
automatically selected
and displayed for you.

541
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:31,196
Look!

542
00:41:31,281 --> 00:41:34,241
Touch the area of the screen
displaying the appropriate icon.

543
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,576
Are we gonna hit that?

544
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,744
Welcome to Jurassic Park.

545
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,251
What have they got
in there, King Kong?

546
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,517
The voice you're now hearing
is Richard Kiley.

547
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,186
We spared no expense.

548
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:03,604
If you look to the right,

549
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:08,609
you'll see a herd of the first dinosaurs
on our tour, called Dilophosaurus.

550
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,694
Dilophosaurus!

551
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,862
Shit!

552
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,780
One of the earliest
carnivores,

553
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:17,201
we now know Dilophosaurus
is actually poisonous

554
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:22,289
spitting its venom at its prey,
causing blindness and paralysis,

555
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,459
allowing the carnivore
to eat at its leisure.

556
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:29,796
This makes Dilophosaurus a
beautiful but deadly addition

557
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,798
to Jurassic Park.

558
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:40,474
Alan?

559
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,726
Where?

560
00:42:46,606 --> 00:42:47,773
Damn.

561
00:42:52,445 --> 00:42:54,738
Vehicle headlights are on
and not responding.

562
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:57,324
Those shouldn't be running
off of car batteries.

563
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:59,993
Item 151 on
today's glitch list.

564
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:03,247
We have all the problems of a
major theme park and a major zoo

565
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:06,333
and the computers aren't
even on their feet yet.

566
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:12,005
Dennis, our lives are in your
hands and you have butterfingers?

567
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,176
I am totally unappreciated
in my time.

568
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:20,097
You can run this park from this room
with minimal staff for up to three days.

569
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,184
You think that kind of
automation is easy? Or cheap?

570
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,062
You know anybody who can
network eight machines

571
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:30,941
and de-bug two million lines of code on my salary?
If so, I want to see them.

572
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:35,445
Sorry about your financial problems, I really am.
But they are your problems.

573
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,365
You're absolutely right.
Everything's my problem.

574
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:42,703
I will not be drawn into another
financial debate with you.

575
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:43,954
I really will not.

576
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:46,081
There's been hardly
any debate at all.

577
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:49,042
I don't blame people
for their mistakes.

578
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:51,878
But I do ask that
they pay for them.

579
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,338
Thanks, Dad.

580
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,632
The headlights.

581
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,302
I'll debug the tour program
when they get back, okay?

582
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,637
It'll eat a lot of
compute cycles.

583
00:44:00,722 --> 00:44:01,763
We'll lose part
of the system.

584
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,975
There's a finite amount of memory,
you can't use it for everything.

585
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,144
Are you gonna compile
for a half an hour...

586
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,687
Quiet, all of you!

587
00:44:09,689 --> 00:44:12,065
They're approaching
the Tyrannosaur paddock.

588
00:45:03,076 --> 00:45:06,620
God creates dinosaurs.
God destroys dinosaurs.

589
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:11,875
God creates man. Man destroys God.
Man creates dinosaurs.

590
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,630
Dinosaurs eat man.

591
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:20,133
Woman inherits the earth.

592
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:30,977
- We'll try to tempt the Rex now.
- Keep watching the fence.

593
00:45:41,114 --> 00:45:43,323
What's going to happen
to the goat?

594
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,162
He's going to eat the goat?

595
00:45:49,330 --> 00:45:50,747
Excellent.

596
00:45:51,833 --> 00:45:55,085
What's the matter, kid?
You never had lamb chops?

597
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,963
I happen to be a vegetarian.

598
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,516
T-Rex doesn't want to be fed.
He wants to hunt.

599
00:46:10,435 --> 00:46:15,188
You can't just suppress 65
million years of gut instinct.

600
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:42,048
Eventually you do plan to have dinosaurs
on your dinosaur tour, right?

601
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,054
Hello. Yes?

602
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,640
I really hate that man.

603
00:46:55,855 --> 00:47:00,650
The Tyrannosaur doesn't obey any
set patterns or park schedules.

604
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:02,903
The essence of chaos.

605
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,072
I'm still not
clear on chaos.

606
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:11,661
It simply deals with
unpredictability in complex systems.

607
00:47:13,206 --> 00:47:15,165
The shorthand is
the Butterfly Effect.

608
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,501
A butterfly can flap
its wings in Peking

609
00:47:17,585 --> 00:47:20,670
and in Central Park you get
rain instead of sunshine.

610
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,758
Was I going too fast?
I missed it.

611
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:26,009
I did a fly-by.

612
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,845
Give me that glass of water.
We'll conduct an experiment.

613
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,680
We should be still.
The car's bouncing.

614
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,599
That's okay.
It's just an example.

615
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:35,101
Put your hand flat
like a hieroglyphic.

616
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,604
A drop of water falls
on your hand.

617
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:40,440
Which way will the drop roll off?
Which finger?

618
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,192
Thumb, I'd say.

619
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,947
Freeze your hand.
Don't move.

620
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:49,950
I'll do the same thing, start
with the same place again.

621
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,451
Which way, now?

622
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:54,538
Let's say back
the same way.

623
00:47:56,916 --> 00:47:59,292
It changed. Why?

624
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,753
Because tiny variations,

625
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,714
the orientation of the hairs
on your hands...

626
00:48:04,799 --> 00:48:06,132
Alan, look at this.

627
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,886
The amount of blood distending your
vessels, imperfections in the skin...

628
00:48:09,971 --> 00:48:11,513
"imperfections in the skin"?

629
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:12,889
Just microscopic,

630
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:15,892
never repeat and vastly
affect the outcome.

631
00:48:15,977 --> 00:48:17,102
That's what?

632
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:18,311
Unpredictability.

633
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,317
There. Look at this.
See? I'm right again.

634
00:48:24,402 --> 00:48:28,822
Nobody could predict that Dr.
Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle.

635
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:33,410
And there's another example.

636
00:48:34,912 --> 00:48:39,332
See, here I am now by myself, talking to myself.
That's Chaos Theory.

637
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,670
Stop the program.

638
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:50,051
I told you, how many times, we needed
locking mechanisms on the vehicle doors.

639
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,762
Stopping park vehicles
and rebooting program.

640
00:48:52,847 --> 00:48:55,140
We're on.
Will notify for resume.

641
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,603
I'll switch it
over to TelePrompTer.

642
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,187
What about
the circuit integrities?

643
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,356
Screen says faulty sensor.

644
00:49:05,693 --> 00:49:06,776
I'll call security.

645
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,195
We're at full go
on that and it looks good.

646
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:12,991
Like I said, there's this other
book by a guy named Bakker

647
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,327
and he says dinosaurs
died from diseases.

648
00:49:15,411 --> 00:49:16,620
Where are we going?

649
00:49:16,704 --> 00:49:18,413
He didn't say
they turned into birds.

650
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,707
Anyone else think
we shouldn't be out here?

651
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:23,960
And his book was a lot fatter than yours.
Like this.

652
00:49:24,045 --> 00:49:26,796
Really?
Yours was fully illustrated.

653
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,174
You okay?

654
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,676
Look at this.
Wait. Watch.

655
00:49:32,386 --> 00:49:34,220
Come on. Watch this.

656
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,766
Whoa.

657
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:41,519
Everybody stay here.

658
00:49:56,744 --> 00:49:57,911
Wow.

659
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:00,747
Okay?

660
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,915
Of course.

661
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,836
- Don't be scared.
- Come on, it's okay.

662
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:08,672
Muldoon tranquillized her
for me.

663
00:50:08,756 --> 00:50:10,090
She's sick.

664
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:20,392
Oh, my God.

665
00:50:35,908 --> 00:50:37,450
Hey, baby.

666
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:45,458
She was always my favorite
when I was a kid

667
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:48,920
and now I see she's the most
beautiful thing I ever saw.

668
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,634
It's okay.

669
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,306
Microvesicles.
That's interesting.

670
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,644
Thanks.
What are her symptoms?

671
00:51:05,229 --> 00:51:07,981
Imbalance, disorientation,
labored breathing.

672
00:51:08,149 --> 00:51:10,316
It seems to happen
every six weeks or so.

673
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,776
Six weeks.

674
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:27,000
These are dilated.
They are?

675
00:51:27,126 --> 00:51:28,877
Take a look.

676
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,086
I'll be damned.

677
00:51:30,588 --> 00:51:34,340
That's pharmacological.
From local plant life.

678
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,892
Is this West Indian lilac?

679
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,896
Yes. We know they're toxic, but
the animals don't eat them.

680
00:51:52,318 --> 00:51:54,027
Are you sure?

681
00:51:54,111 --> 00:51:55,153
Pretty sure.

682
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,907
There's only one way
to be positive.

683
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:02,118
I'd have to see
the dinosaur's droppings.

684
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,414
Dino droppings?
Droppings?

685
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:14,464
Yeah, I got that.

686
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,802
That storm center hasn't
dissipated or changed course.

687
00:52:18,928 --> 00:52:21,387
We're gonna have to
cut the tour short.

688
00:52:21,472 --> 00:52:23,264
We'll pick it up
again tomorrow.

689
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,641
Are you sure we have to?

690
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:26,601
It's not worth
taking the chance.

691
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:27,936
Sustained winds at 45 knots.

692
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,313
Tell them when they get
back in the cars.

693
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:35,068
Ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle leaving
for the dock leaves in five minutes.

694
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,487
Drop what you're doing
and leave now.

695
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:40,907
Damn!

696
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:50,500
That is one
big pile of shit.

697
00:52:57,842 --> 00:53:00,468
You're right.
There's no trace of lilac berries.

698
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,595
That's so odd, though.

699
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:06,683
All right, she's suffering
from Melia toxicity

700
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:10,687
every six weeks.

701
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:15,859
Let's see, rats.

702
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,988
She's tenacious.

703
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:22,615
You have no idea.

704
00:53:24,827 --> 00:53:28,580
You will remember to wash your
hands before you eat anything?

705
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:44,762
Doctors, if you please, I have
to insist that we get moving.

706
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:50,768
I'd like to stay with Dr.
Harding and finish up with the Trike.

707
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,313
Sure. I'm in
a gas-powered jeep.

708
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,149
I'll drop her off at the
center before I make the boat.

709
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,943
Great. Then I'll catch
up with you later.

710
00:53:59,028 --> 00:54:00,153
You sure?

711
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,989
Yeah, I want to stay
with her a little longer.

712
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:04,490
Okay, then.

713
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:23,593
There's nothing I can do.
The captain says we got to go, we got to go.

714
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,386
You've got to
give me the time.

715
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,932
I did a test run, it took me 20 minutes.
I think I can push it to 18

716
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,351
but you've got to give me
at least 15 minutes.

717
00:54:31,435 --> 00:54:32,769
No promises.

718
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:43,237
Visitor vehicles are
returning to the garage.

719
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:50,453
So much for our first tour.
Two no-shows and one sick Triceratops.

720
00:54:51,872 --> 00:54:53,581
It could've been worse.

721
00:54:54,792 --> 00:54:56,042
A lot worse.

722
00:54:56,210 --> 00:55:00,296
Anybody want a soda or something?
I'm going up to the machine.

723
00:55:00,381 --> 00:55:02,548
I thought maybe
I'd get somebody something.

724
00:55:02,633 --> 00:55:06,386
I've had only sweets and I'm
gonna get something salty.

725
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:09,639
I finished
debugging the phones.

726
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,809
I was going to, so I did.

727
00:55:13,060 --> 00:55:16,062
So I debugged the phones.
And I thought maybe

728
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:18,898
I should tell you the system
will be compiling

729
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:21,901
for 18 to 20 minutes,
so some of the minor systems,

730
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:25,905
they might go on and off for a while,
but it's nothing to worry about.

731
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,512
Do you got any kids?

732
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,515
Me? Hell, yeah.
Three. I love kids.

733
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:56,686
Anything at all can
and does happen.

734
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,689
Same with wives,
for that matter.

735
00:56:00,107 --> 00:56:01,315
You're married?

736
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,567
Occasionally.

737
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:08,990
I'm always on the lookout
for a future ex-Mrs. Malcolm.

738
00:56:22,546 --> 00:56:25,798
Five, four, three,

739
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,801
two, one.

740
00:56:37,144 --> 00:56:39,395
- That's odd.
- What?

741
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:42,065
Door security systems
are shutting down.

742
00:56:42,149 --> 00:56:45,401
Nedry said a few systems
would go off-line, didn't he?

743
00:57:41,542 --> 00:57:43,668
By the way, Dr. Sattler,

744
00:57:44,545 --> 00:57:46,796
she's not available,
is she?

745
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,964
Why?

746
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,010
I'm sorry. You two are...

747
00:57:53,095 --> 00:57:54,137
Yeah.

748
00:57:57,057 --> 00:57:58,474
What'd I touch?

749
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,810
You didn't touch anything.
We stopped.

750
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,404
What the hell?

751
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:12,488
What now?

752
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,490
Fences are failing
all over the park.

753
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,076
Find Nedry. Check
the vending machines.

754
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:51,027
Just look at this
work station.

755
00:58:51,111 --> 00:58:52,361
What a complete slob.

756
00:58:52,446 --> 00:58:54,739
The Raptor fences
aren't out, are they?

757
00:59:01,622 --> 00:59:03,414
No, no. They're still on.

758
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:08,586
Why the hell would he turn
the other ones off?

759
00:59:48,669 --> 00:59:50,336
Access main program.

760
00:59:51,171 --> 00:59:52,838
Access main security.

761
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,675
Access main program grid.

762
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,519
You didn't say
the magic word.

763
01:00:06,937 --> 01:00:10,481
Please! God damn it.
I hate this hacker crap.

764
01:00:10,607 --> 01:00:14,026
Phone Nedry's
people in Cambridge.

765
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,822
Phones are out, too.

766
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:23,286
Where did the vehicles stop?

767
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,891
Their radio's out, too.

768
01:00:46,226 --> 01:00:48,561
Gennaro said to stay put.
Kids okay?

769
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,771
I didn't ask.
Why wouldn't they be?

770
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:52,565
Kids get scared.
What's scary?

771
01:00:52,691 --> 01:00:55,818
It's just a little hiccup in the power.
I'm not scared.

772
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:56,861
I didn't say
you were scared.

773
01:00:56,945 --> 01:00:58,237
I know.

774
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,323
Boo!

775
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,909
Hey, where did
you find those?

776
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,369
In the box, under my seat.

777
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,746
Are they heavy?

778
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,623
Yeah. Then they're expensive.
Put them back.

779
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,424
Don't scare me.

780
01:01:29,978 --> 01:01:31,771
Cool. Night vision.

781
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,672
Did you feel that?

782
01:02:32,666 --> 01:02:35,292
Maybe it's the power
trying to come back on.

783
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:39,171
What is that?

784
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,481
Where's the goat?

785
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:22,006
Jesus!

786
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:28,471
He left us.

787
01:03:39,941 --> 01:03:42,485
Where does he think
he's going?

788
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:44,278
When you got to go,
you got to go.

789
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:03,714
Dr. Grant.

790
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,729
I hate being
right all the time.

791
01:04:27,781 --> 01:04:31,951
Keep absolutely still.
Its vision is based on movement.

792
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:47,925
Turn the light off.

793
01:04:52,806 --> 01:04:54,306
Turn the light off!

794
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:51,614
Hurry! Turn it off!

795
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,032
I'm sorry!

796
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,204
You're the one
who turned it...

797
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:19,326
Ian, freeze!

798
01:07:19,828 --> 01:07:21,286
Get the kids!

799
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,205
Get rid of the flare!

800
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,540
Get the kids!

801
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:27,126
Get rid of the flare!

802
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:31,630
Hail Mary,
full of grace...

803
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,482
No!

804
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:55,654
Dr. Grant!

805
01:08:00,243 --> 01:08:02,828
I'm stuck.
The seat's got my feet.

806
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:05,205
I'll get you next.
You're okay.

807
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:08,000
You're all right.

808
01:08:08,710 --> 01:08:10,335
Tim!

809
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,925
Don't move.
He can't see us if we don't move.

810
01:09:22,325 --> 01:09:24,409
Lex, you're choking me.

811
01:09:27,247 --> 01:09:28,497
Grab the wire.

812
01:09:48,268 --> 01:09:52,145
"Keycheck space minus 0.
Keychecks off, safety space minus 0."

813
01:09:52,272 --> 01:09:55,440
He's turning the safety systems off.
Doesn't want anybody to see.

814
01:09:55,525 --> 01:09:58,819
Look at this next entry. It's the kicker.
"White rabbit object."

815
01:09:58,945 --> 01:10:01,154
It did it all.
With the keychecks off,

816
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,865
the computer didn't
file the keystrokes.

817
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:06,702
The way to find them is to check the
computer's lines of code one by one.

818
01:10:06,786 --> 01:10:08,370
How many lines of
code are there?

819
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:09,955
About two million.

820
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:11,707
Two million?
Yeah.

821
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:19,298
Robert, I wonder if perhaps you would
be good enough to take a gas jeep

822
01:10:20,884 --> 01:10:23,135
and bring back
my grandchildren.

823
01:10:24,012 --> 01:10:25,178
Sure.

824
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:29,474
I'm going with him.

825
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:33,979
John.

826
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:43,530
I can't get Jurassic Park back
online without Dennis Nedry.

827
01:10:46,451 --> 01:10:48,076
Should have been
there by now.

828
01:11:03,343 --> 01:11:04,676
Damn it!

829
01:11:11,351 --> 01:11:12,768
There's the road!

830
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:23,362
Winch this sucker off the thing and
then I tie it to that thing there.

831
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,865
I'll pull down this thing here,
and pull it back up again.

832
01:11:35,208 --> 01:11:38,627
My glasses. I can
afford more glasses!

833
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,159
You've got time. You can do it.
Do it. Come on, Dennis.

834
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,793
Hello.

835
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,551
Yeah, that's nice.
I've got to go.

836
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,105
Nice boy.

837
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:43,817
Nice dinosaur.

838
01:12:44,652 --> 01:12:48,071
Thought you were one of your big brothers.
You're not so bad.

839
01:12:48,156 --> 01:12:52,075
What do you want? A little food?
Look at me. I just fell down a hill.

840
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:55,662
I'm soaking wet. I don't have any food.
I have nothing on me.

841
01:12:57,290 --> 01:12:59,458
Go on. Play fetch?

842
01:13:01,419 --> 01:13:02,627
Look, stick.

843
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:06,465
Look at stick.

844
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:10,302
Stick, stupid. Fetch the stick, boy.
Look at the stick.

845
01:13:10,803 --> 01:13:13,138
You like the stick?
Go on and get it.

846
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:15,140
No wonder you're extinct.

847
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:19,061
I'm gonna run you over
when I come back down.

848
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:36,680
Timmy!

849
01:14:40,768 --> 01:14:42,811
Now, Lex. Listen.

850
01:14:43,521 --> 01:14:45,188
Lex, I'm right here.

851
01:14:45,857 --> 01:14:48,358
I'll look after you.
I have to help your brother.

852
01:14:48,442 --> 01:14:50,652
Stay right here
and wait for me.

853
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,363
He left us.

854
01:14:53,865 --> 01:14:56,366
But that's not what
I'm going to do.

855
01:14:58,411 --> 01:14:59,578
Okay?

856
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,165
Stay here.

857
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:32,319
You hear me?
I'm coming up.

858
01:15:33,029 --> 01:15:36,990
I hate climbing.
I hate trees, way too high.

859
01:16:05,269 --> 01:16:06,353
You okay?

860
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:10,607
I threw up.

861
01:16:13,736 --> 01:16:14,945
That's okay.

862
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,614
Just give me your hand.

863
01:16:21,786 --> 01:16:25,830
Tim, I won't tell anyone you threw up.
Just give me your hand.

864
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:36,383
Here, I've got you.

865
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:39,177
Okay.

866
01:16:39,595 --> 01:16:42,180
That's good.
Over the rail.

867
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,431
Don't pull me too hard.

868
01:16:47,979 --> 01:16:50,230
- Stand on the door.
- Hang on to me.

869
01:16:53,859 --> 01:16:56,569
That's not too bad, right, Timmy?
Yes, it is.

870
01:16:56,654 --> 01:16:59,364
It's like a tree house.
Your dad ever build you one?

871
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:00,991
No.
Yeah, me, too.

872
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,453
The thing about climbing is,
you never look down.

873
01:17:05,538 --> 01:17:07,122
This is impossible.

874
01:17:07,415 --> 01:17:08,790
How am I going to do this?
It's about...

875
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,960
I'm going to help you
with your footing.

876
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:16,881
Oh, no.

877
01:17:17,425 --> 01:17:18,717
Tim, go.

878
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:42,532
Go, Tim, go!

879
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:52,042
Faster, Tim!

880
01:17:58,758 --> 01:17:59,883
Tim, jump!

881
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:04,971
Go, Tim.

882
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,857
We're back
in the car again.

883
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:20,153
At least
you're out of the tree.

884
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:27,994
Where's the other car?

885
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:31,581
Alan!

886
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:33,958
Dr. Grant!

887
01:18:50,101 --> 01:18:52,143
I think this was Gennaro.

888
01:18:52,228 --> 01:18:53,520
I think this was, too.

889
01:18:57,108 --> 01:18:58,108
I think it's ahead of us.

890
01:18:58,192 --> 01:18:59,651
It could be anywhere.

891
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,946
With fences down, it can wander in
and out of any paddock it likes.

892
01:19:10,121 --> 01:19:12,122
He's put a tourniquet on. Ian.

893
01:19:13,833 --> 01:19:16,543
Remind me to thank John
for a lovely weekend.

894
01:19:21,549 --> 01:19:23,299
Can we chance moving him?

895
01:19:24,635 --> 01:19:26,094
Please chance it.

896
01:19:34,645 --> 01:19:36,229
Ellie, come on!

897
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:45,029
It's the other car!

898
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:46,865
Dr. Grant?

899
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,871
They're not here.

900
01:20:22,234 --> 01:20:23,735
Anybody hear that?

901
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:29,741
It's an impact tremor,
is what it is.

902
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,410
I'm fairly alarmed here.

903
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:37,582
Come on. We've got to get out of here.
Now! Right now!

904
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:39,459
Let's go.

905
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,222
Must go faster.

906
01:20:54,892 --> 01:20:57,727
Here it comes!
Stand on it! Fifth gear!

907
01:21:04,068 --> 01:21:05,818
Get off the stick!
Bloody move!

908
01:21:05,903 --> 01:21:07,195
Look out!

909
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,641
Think they'll have
that on the tour?

910
01:21:44,817 --> 01:21:46,401
Are you hearing this?

911
01:21:52,992 --> 01:21:55,159
- Come on, Tim.
- Hurry up.

912
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:57,829
Let's get up this tree.

913
01:22:00,791 --> 01:22:03,543
Come on, Tim, it's okay.
Listen. Try up here.

914
01:22:05,379 --> 01:22:06,629
Oh, man.

915
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,215
I hate trees.

916
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:11,092
They don't bother me.

917
01:22:11,176 --> 01:22:13,386
Yeah? Well, you weren't
in the last one.

918
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:31,571
Look at the Brontosauruses.
I mean, Brachiosaurus.

919
01:22:33,115 --> 01:22:34,532
They're singing.

920
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:05,605
Don't let the monsters
come over here.

921
01:23:05,689 --> 01:23:09,108
They're not monsters, they're animals.
These are herbivores.

922
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:12,737
They only eat vegetables.
For you, I think they'd make an exception.

923
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,489
I hate the other kind.

924
01:23:16,575 --> 01:23:19,369
They just do what they do.

925
01:23:39,473 --> 01:23:40,682
What's that?

926
01:23:45,896 --> 01:23:49,857
What are you and Ellie going to do now,
if you don't dig up bones any more?

927
01:23:51,276 --> 01:23:52,527
I don't know.

928
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,197
I guess we'll just
have to evolve, too.

929
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:06,290
What do you call
a blind dinosaur?

930
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:08,084
"Do-you-think-he-saurus."

931
01:24:11,797 --> 01:24:14,298
What do you call
a blind dinosaur's dog?

932
01:24:15,134 --> 01:24:16,467
You got me.

933
01:24:16,635 --> 01:24:18,720
A "Do-you-think
- He-saurus rex."

934
01:24:21,181 --> 01:24:22,223
Alan?

935
01:24:22,307 --> 01:24:23,474
Yeah?

936
01:24:24,143 --> 01:24:27,311
What if the dinosaurs come
back while we're all asleep?

937
01:24:29,648 --> 01:24:31,816
I'll stay awake.
All night?

938
01:24:34,445 --> 01:24:35,570
All night.

939
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:27,455
They were all melting.

940
01:25:31,168 --> 01:25:34,295
Malcolm's okay for now.
I gave him a shot of morphine.

941
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,717
They'll be fine.

942
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:45,014
Who better to get the children through
Jurassic Park than a dinosaur expert?

943
01:25:49,478 --> 01:25:51,229
You know, the first

944
01:25:52,523 --> 01:25:55,983
attraction I ever built when
I came down from Scotland

945
01:25:57,653 --> 01:26:00,154
was a flea circus,
Petticoat Lane.

946
01:26:01,532 --> 01:26:03,324
Really quite wonderful.

947
01:26:03,909 --> 01:26:07,161
I had a wee trapeze
and a

948
01:26:10,374 --> 01:26:11,582
carousel

949
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:16,921
and a seesaw.

950
01:26:18,048 --> 01:26:20,258
They all move motorized,
of course.

951
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:23,261
People said they saw the fleas.
"I can see the fleas."

952
01:26:23,387 --> 01:26:25,096
"Can't you see the fleas?"

953
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:30,184
Clown fleas, high-wire fleas,
and fleas on parade.

954
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,859
With this place,

955
01:26:39,945 --> 01:26:43,364
I wanted to show them something
that wasn't an illusion.

956
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:47,451
Something that was real.
Something that they could

957
01:26:50,622 --> 01:26:52,081
see and touch.

958
01:26:56,795 --> 01:26:59,255
An aim not
devoid of merit.

959
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:07,388
But you can't think through this one, John.
You have to feel it.

960
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,309
You're absolutely right.

961
01:27:13,145 --> 01:27:15,479
Hiring Nedry was a mistake,
that's obvious.

962
01:27:15,564 --> 01:27:18,232
We're over-dependent on
automation, I can see that now.

963
01:27:18,317 --> 01:27:20,985
Next time,
everything's correctable.

964
01:27:21,778 --> 01:27:24,989
Creation is an act
of sheer will.

965
01:27:27,326 --> 01:27:29,285
Next time,
it'll be flawless.

966
01:27:29,828 --> 01:27:33,164
It's still the flea circus.
It's all an illusion.

967
01:27:33,332 --> 01:27:34,832
When we have control...

968
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:37,585
You've never had control!
That's the illusion.

969
01:27:37,753 --> 01:27:40,421
I was overwhelmed
by the power of this place.

970
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:43,257
I made a mistake, too.

971
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:47,178
I didn't have enough respect for
that power, and it's out now.

972
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:52,975
The only thing that matters
now are the people we love.

973
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:57,271
Alan and Lex and Tim.

974
01:27:58,857 --> 01:28:02,026
John, they're out there,
where people are dying.

975
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:20,211
It's good.

976
01:28:24,174 --> 01:28:25,633
Spared no expense.

977
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:53,995
Go away!

978
01:28:54,079 --> 01:28:56,163
It's okay.
It's a Brachiosaurus.

979
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,500
It's a "Veggie-saurus", Lex.
"Veggie-saurus."

980
01:29:00,043 --> 01:29:01,252
Veggie.

981
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:03,921
Come on. Come on, girl.

982
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:09,552
Come on, baby.

983
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:14,432
Go.

984
01:29:15,934 --> 01:29:17,435
I'm not letting go.

985
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,531
It looks like
it has a cold.

986
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,241
Yeah. Maybe.

987
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:34,243
Can I touch it?
Sure.

988
01:29:34,578 --> 01:29:37,621
Just think of it
as kind of a big cow.

989
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,209
I like cows.

990
01:29:52,262 --> 01:29:54,597
Come on, girl.
Come on up here, girl.

991
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:03,314
God bless you.

992
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,654
- Yuck.
- Great.

993
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:12,698
Now she'll never
try anything new.

994
01:30:13,158 --> 01:30:16,160
She'll sit in her room, never
come out, play on her computer.

995
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:17,244
I'm a hacker.

996
01:30:17,329 --> 01:30:19,038
That's what I said.
You're a nerd.

997
01:30:19,164 --> 01:30:20,664
I am not
a computer nerd.

998
01:30:20,749 --> 01:30:22,374
I prefer to be
called a hacker.

999
01:30:22,626 --> 01:30:23,834
God.

1000
01:30:28,673 --> 01:30:30,341
You know what this is?

1001
01:30:32,219 --> 01:30:34,220
It's a dinosaur egg.

1002
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:38,182
The dinosaurs are breeding.

1003
01:30:41,353 --> 01:30:45,397
But my grandpa said all
the dinosaurs were girls.

1004
01:30:46,817 --> 01:30:49,026
Amphibian DNA.
What's that?

1005
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,863
Well, on the tour,

1006
01:30:53,073 --> 01:30:57,868
the film said they used frog DNA
to fill in the gene-sequence gaps.

1007
01:30:58,036 --> 01:31:01,372
They mutated the dinosaur
genetic code

1008
01:31:02,374 --> 01:31:04,667
and blended it with
that of frogs.

1009
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:12,007
Some West African frogs have been known
to change sex from male to female

1010
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:14,176
in a single sex environment.

1011
01:31:16,054 --> 01:31:17,555
Malcolm was right.

1012
01:31:19,099 --> 01:31:20,266
Look.

1013
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:30,609
Life found a way.

1014
01:31:32,946 --> 01:31:35,531
- No. That's crazy.
- You're out of your mind.

1015
01:31:35,615 --> 01:31:37,575
He's absolutely
out of his mind.

1016
01:31:38,243 --> 01:31:40,411
Wait.
What exactly would this mean?

1017
01:31:40,537 --> 01:31:42,538
We're talking about
a calculated risk,

1018
01:31:42,622 --> 01:31:44,373
which is the only
option left to us.

1019
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:48,919
We'll never find the command Nedry used.
He's covered his tracks far too well.

1020
01:31:49,421 --> 01:31:52,256
I think it's obvious now
that he's not coming back.

1021
01:31:52,382 --> 01:31:54,842
So, shutting down
the entire system...

1022
01:31:54,926 --> 01:31:56,886
Get somebody else.
I won't do it.

1023
01:31:56,970 --> 01:32:01,974
Shutting down the system is the only
way to wipe out everything he did.

1024
01:32:03,268 --> 01:32:06,896
Now, as I understand it, all the
systems will then come back

1025
01:32:07,063 --> 01:32:09,773
on their original
start-up mode. Correct?

1026
01:32:09,983 --> 01:32:13,277
Theoretically, yes. We've never
shut down the entire system before.

1027
01:32:13,403 --> 01:32:14,612
It may not come back on.

1028
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,363
Would we get
the phones back?

1029
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,115
Yes, again, in theory.

1030
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:20,576
What about
the lysine contingency?

1031
01:32:20,660 --> 01:32:22,119
We could put
that into effect.

1032
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:23,204
What's that?

1033
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,039
That's absolutely out
of the question.

1034
01:32:25,123 --> 01:32:27,958
The lysine contingency prevents
the spread of animals,

1035
01:32:28,084 --> 01:32:29,919
if they ever get
off the island.

1036
01:32:30,003 --> 01:32:33,672
Wu inserted a gene that creates a
faulty enzyme in protein metabolism.

1037
01:32:33,798 --> 01:32:36,675
The animals can't manufacture
the amino acid, lysine.

1038
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:40,512
Unless they're supplied with lysine
by us, they slip into a coma and die.

1039
01:32:40,639 --> 01:32:43,098
People are dying.

1040
01:32:47,312 --> 01:32:49,647
Will you please shut
down the system?

1041
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:13,337
Hold on to your butts.

1042
01:33:33,191 --> 01:33:34,316
It's okay.

1043
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:37,111
Look, see that?
It's on. It worked.

1044
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:41,991
What do you mean it worked?
Everything's off.

1045
01:33:42,075 --> 01:33:43,701
Shutdown tripped
the circuit breakers.

1046
01:33:43,785 --> 01:33:46,203
Turn them back on,
reboot a few systems:

1047
01:33:46,288 --> 01:33:49,665
Telephones, security doors, half
dozen others, but it worked.

1048
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,834
System's ready.
Where are the breakers?

1049
01:33:51,918 --> 01:33:53,961
Maintenance shed
at the end of the compound.

1050
01:33:54,045 --> 01:33:56,797
Three minutes, I'll have the
power back on in the park.

1051
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:59,967
Just to be safe, I want everybody
in the emergency bunker

1052
01:34:00,051 --> 01:34:03,387
until Mr. Arnold returns, and the
whole system's running again.

1053
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:05,139
I'm tired.
I'm dirty.

1054
01:34:05,223 --> 01:34:06,598
I'm hot.

1055
01:34:06,808 --> 01:34:10,561
Looking at the map, I'd say the
visitor's center is just a mile

1056
01:34:11,229 --> 01:34:14,523
over that rise there.
Just keep...

1057
01:34:17,402 --> 01:34:18,902
What is that?

1058
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,407
Tim, can you tell me
what they are?

1059
01:34:24,784 --> 01:34:26,118
They are

1060
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:31,707
Gallimimus.

1061
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:34,293
Are those meat-eating?

1062
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:37,338
"Meat-asauruses"?

1063
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,678
Look at the wheeling.
Uniform direction changes.

1064
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:47,431
Just like a flock of birds
evading a predator.

1065
01:34:48,933 --> 01:34:52,102
They're flocking this way.

1066
01:35:35,063 --> 01:35:36,063
I want to go now.

1067
01:35:36,147 --> 01:35:37,231
Just look how it eats.

1068
01:35:37,315 --> 01:35:38,607
Please.

1069
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:41,485
I bet you'll never look at
birds the same way again.

1070
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:43,654
Yes.
Go now.

1071
01:35:45,490 --> 01:35:48,158
Okay. Keep low
and follow me.

1072
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:52,329
Look how much blood.

1073
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:56,667
God. Something went wrong.

1074
01:35:57,585 --> 01:36:01,130
Something's happened.
Something's wrong.

1075
01:36:03,842 --> 01:36:05,426
This is just a delay.

1076
01:36:05,510 --> 01:36:08,595
That's all it is.
All major theme parks have delays.

1077
01:36:08,847 --> 01:36:13,183
When they opened Disneyland
in 1956, nothing worked.

1078
01:36:13,601 --> 01:36:15,936
If the Pirates of
the Caribbean breaks down,

1079
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,271
the pirates don't
eat tourists.

1080
01:36:17,355 --> 01:36:20,816
I can't wait any more.
Something's wrong.

1081
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,276
I'm gonna go get
the power back on.

1082
01:36:22,527 --> 01:36:25,654
You can't just stroll
down the road, you know?

1083
01:36:25,822 --> 01:36:29,116
Don't let's be too hasty.
I mean, it's only been gone...

1084
01:36:31,786 --> 01:36:33,829
I'm going with you.
Okay.

1085
01:36:49,471 --> 01:36:50,679
Sorry.

1086
01:36:54,517 --> 01:36:58,729
Now, this isn't going to be just
like switching on the kitchen light.

1087
01:36:58,897 --> 01:37:02,232
But I think I can follow this
and then talk you through it.

1088
01:37:06,696 --> 01:37:07,905
Right.

1089
01:37:13,912 --> 01:37:15,913
But it ought to be me,
really, going.

1090
01:37:16,039 --> 01:37:16,997
Why?

1091
01:37:17,081 --> 01:37:18,916
I'm a... And you're a...

1092
01:37:20,376 --> 01:37:22,669
Look.
Come on, let's go.

1093
01:37:22,754 --> 01:37:26,006
We can discuss sexism in survival
situations when I get back.

1094
01:37:26,090 --> 01:37:29,760
You just take me through this step by step.
I'm on Channel 2.

1095
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:30,886
Right.

1096
01:38:06,756 --> 01:38:09,466
The shutdown must've
turned off all the fences.

1097
01:38:10,134 --> 01:38:13,804
Damn it, even Nedry knew better
than to mess with the Raptor pen.

1098
01:38:19,477 --> 01:38:20,727
Come on, this way.

1099
01:38:28,444 --> 01:38:30,404
I can see the shed
from here.

1100
01:38:30,613 --> 01:38:32,322
We can make it if we run.

1101
01:38:32,657 --> 01:38:35,242
No. We can't.

1102
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:37,452
Why not?

1103
01:38:37,954 --> 01:38:39,871
Because we're being hunted.

1104
01:38:41,207 --> 01:38:43,208
In the bushes,
straight ahead.

1105
01:38:45,837 --> 01:38:47,170
It's all right.

1106
01:38:47,714 --> 01:38:49,131
Like hell it is.

1107
01:38:50,466 --> 01:38:53,635
Run. Towards the shed.

1108
01:38:55,847 --> 01:38:57,306
I've got her.

1109
01:38:58,224 --> 01:38:59,725
Go. Now!

1110
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,329
Mr. Arnold?

1111
01:39:25,668 --> 01:39:26,877
John, I'm in.

1112
01:39:27,503 --> 01:39:28,712
Great.

1113
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:33,508
Ahead of you is a metal staircase.
Go down it.

1114
01:39:34,552 --> 01:39:36,845
Okay. Going down.

1115
01:39:37,722 --> 01:39:41,475
After 20 or 30 feet you come
to a T-junction. Take a left.

1116
01:39:41,559 --> 01:39:42,726
Have her follow
the main cable.

1117
01:39:42,810 --> 01:39:44,728
I know how to read
a schematic.

1118
01:40:15,051 --> 01:40:17,260
I guess that means
the power's off.

1119
01:40:30,483 --> 01:40:31,858
That's not funny.

1120
01:40:31,943 --> 01:40:33,110
That was great.

1121
01:40:35,613 --> 01:40:37,572
Well, maybe we, we could...

1122
01:40:55,425 --> 01:40:57,926
Damn it. Dead end.

1123
01:40:58,302 --> 01:40:59,511
Wait a minute.

1124
01:41:01,097 --> 01:41:04,349
There should have been a right
turn back there somewhere.

1125
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:06,935
Look above you.

1126
01:41:07,812 --> 01:41:11,648
There should be a bundle of cable and
pipes all heading in the same direction.

1127
01:41:11,774 --> 01:41:12,941
Follow that.

1128
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,777
Okay. Following the piping.

1129
01:41:18,448 --> 01:41:22,868
I bet I could climb over to the other side
before you could even get to the top.

1130
01:41:22,994 --> 01:41:24,244
What would you give me?

1131
01:41:24,328 --> 01:41:25,370
Respect.

1132
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:28,331
Come on, guys,
it's not a race.

1133
01:41:30,001 --> 01:41:31,209
I see the box.

1134
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:36,006
It says, "High Voltage."
Yeah.

1135
01:41:39,051 --> 01:41:40,218
Okay.

1136
01:41:44,182 --> 01:41:46,850
Good. Here we go.

1137
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:48,685
Over the top.

1138
01:41:49,353 --> 01:41:50,979
Take your time.

1139
01:41:51,981 --> 01:41:53,523
Good. Come on.

1140
01:41:53,691 --> 01:41:55,650
Find your footing.

1141
01:41:57,862 --> 01:42:00,572
You can't throw
the main switch by hand.

1142
01:42:00,698 --> 01:42:04,075
You've got to pump up the primer
handle in order to get the charge.

1143
01:42:04,202 --> 01:42:06,536
It's large, flat, and gray.

1144
01:42:07,330 --> 01:42:09,206
All right,
here I go. Okay?

1145
01:42:10,792 --> 01:42:15,879
One, two, three, four.

1146
01:42:16,339 --> 01:42:17,923
Okay, charged.

1147
01:42:18,674 --> 01:42:22,427
Under the words "Contact Position
," there's a round green button

1148
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:25,055
which says "Push to Close."

1149
01:42:25,598 --> 01:42:27,432
Push to close.

1150
01:42:30,937 --> 01:42:32,229
Push it.

1151
01:42:47,161 --> 01:42:51,122
The red buttons turn on
the individual park systems.

1152
01:42:51,999 --> 01:42:53,291
Switch them on.

1153
01:43:04,804 --> 01:43:05,804
Get down now!

1154
01:43:05,888 --> 01:43:07,013
You're gonna have to jump.

1155
01:43:07,098 --> 01:43:08,932
You crazy?
I'm not gonna jump.

1156
01:43:09,016 --> 01:43:10,267
Do what Dr. Grant says!

1157
01:43:10,351 --> 01:43:11,643
Let go.
I'll count to three.

1158
01:43:11,769 --> 01:43:14,145
One, two, three!

1159
01:43:15,106 --> 01:43:17,482
Four. Five.

1160
01:43:18,276 --> 01:43:19,985
I'm coming up to get you.

1161
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:21,611
I've got to get Tim.

1162
01:43:21,779 --> 01:43:23,446
Okay. I'm gonna
count to three.

1163
01:43:26,325 --> 01:43:27,534
One,

1164
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:30,370
two...

1165
01:43:41,465 --> 01:43:42,966
He's not breathing.

1166
01:43:47,889 --> 01:43:50,307
I think we're back
in business!

1167
01:43:58,524 --> 01:43:59,983
No!

1168
01:45:30,074 --> 01:45:31,324
Clever girl.

1169
01:45:55,641 --> 01:45:56,933
No, Tim!

1170
01:45:59,687 --> 01:46:01,604
Good boy.

1171
01:46:06,152 --> 01:46:07,360
Three.

1172
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:13,616
Hello?

1173
01:46:23,794 --> 01:46:27,213
Okay. I'm gonna have
to find the others.

1174
01:46:28,299 --> 01:46:31,051
Get you to a doctor.

1175
01:46:33,095 --> 01:46:35,388
Lex, you look after Tim.
Yeah.

1176
01:46:36,682 --> 01:46:38,641
Your hair is
all sticking up.

1177
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,937
Big Tim, the human
piece of toast.

1178
01:46:47,234 --> 01:46:49,402
I'll be back soon.
I promise.

1179
01:47:16,722 --> 01:47:17,847
Run.

1180
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:36,259
Just the two Raptors, right?

1181
01:48:37,761 --> 01:48:39,637
You sure the third
one's contained?

1182
01:48:39,722 --> 01:48:43,308
Yes, unless they figure out
how to open doors.

1183
01:49:09,919 --> 01:49:11,753
What is it?

1184
01:49:11,837 --> 01:49:13,213
It's a Velociraptor.

1185
01:49:15,883 --> 01:49:17,383
It's inside.

1186
01:49:42,952 --> 01:49:44,035
Follow me.

1187
01:52:19,608 --> 01:52:20,858
It's in there.

1188
01:52:21,735 --> 01:52:22,985
Control room.

1189
01:52:29,326 --> 01:52:30,410
We can
call for help?

1190
01:52:30,494 --> 01:52:32,829
We've got to reboot
the system first.

1191
01:52:35,457 --> 01:52:36,749
The door locks!

1192
01:52:37,668 --> 01:52:39,710
Ellie, boot up
the door locks!

1193
01:52:49,221 --> 01:52:51,055
No, boot up
the door locks!

1194
01:52:52,099 --> 01:52:54,100
Get back! Boot up
the door locks.

1195
01:52:54,184 --> 01:52:55,935
You can't hold it
by yourself!

1196
01:53:04,361 --> 01:53:07,864
It's a UNIX system.
I know this.

1197
01:53:08,615 --> 01:53:10,700
It's all the files
of the whole park.

1198
01:53:10,784 --> 01:53:14,036
It tells you everything.
I've got to find the right file.

1199
01:53:14,788 --> 01:53:16,372
Try to reach the gun.

1200
01:53:24,882 --> 01:53:26,841
I can't get it
unless I move.

1201
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:44,734
This is it. This might
be the right file.

1202
01:54:00,876 --> 01:54:02,460
You got it!
Yes!

1203
01:54:05,923 --> 01:54:07,173
Did it!

1204
01:54:07,424 --> 01:54:08,758
Yes!

1205
01:54:13,013 --> 01:54:14,222
What works?

1206
01:54:14,306 --> 01:54:17,016
All security systems
are enabled. We got it.

1207
01:54:26,902 --> 01:54:28,110
Grant.

1208
01:54:28,195 --> 01:54:31,113
Mr. Hammond,
the phones are working.

1209
01:54:31,615 --> 01:54:32,865
The children all right?

1210
01:54:32,950 --> 01:54:34,283
The children are fine.

1211
01:54:34,785 --> 01:54:38,621
Call the mainland.
Tell them to send the damn helicopters.

1212
01:54:39,414 --> 01:54:41,582
It's gonna cut
through the glass!

1213
01:55:33,302 --> 01:55:34,468
Move!

1214
01:56:20,015 --> 01:56:22,558
Tim, let go. Yeah!

1215
01:57:39,928 --> 01:57:44,223
After careful consideration, I've
decided not to endorse your park.

1216
01:57:44,975 --> 01:57:46,392
So have I.

1217
01:58:33,982 --> 01:58:35,024
Come on.
