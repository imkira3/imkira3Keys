<i>May 17th, 2009.</i>

4
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:58,978
<i>Further research on Himiko.</i>

5
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,483
<i>According to legend, Himiko,
the first queen of Japan,</i>

6
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,286
<i>was a powerful sorceress</i>

7
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:08,822
<i>who ruled her empire
through dark magic,</i>

8
00:01:08,824 --> 00:01:10,958
<i>spreading death
and destruction</i>

9
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,859
<i>by the mere touch of her hand.</i>

10
00:01:13,861 --> 00:01:17,264
<i>She was only stopped
by a single twist of fate.</i>

11
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:21,635
<i>An army of her own generals
bound and dragged Himiko</i>

12
00:01:21,637 --> 00:01:23,704
<i>to an uninhabitable island</i>

13
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:26,806
<i>in the middle of
the treacherous Devil's Sea.</i>

14
00:01:26,808 --> 00:01:32,213
<i>There, she remains entombed
beneath the mountains.</i>

15
00:01:32,215 --> 00:01:36,951
<i>I found a speck on an old map
that no one else has.</i>

16
00:01:36,953 --> 00:01:38,784
<i>And she's there,</i>

17
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:40,589
<i>waiting to be unleashed.</i>

18
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:45,993
<i>I have to get there first.</i>

19
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,826
<i>Even if it means
doing the last thing</i>

20
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:50,496
<i>I'd ever want to do...</i>

21
00:01:50,498 --> 00:01:53,536
<i>Leaving my Lara behind.</i>

22
00:01:55,537 --> 00:01:57,003
<i>You gotta
make decisions, Lara.</i>

23
00:01:57,005 --> 00:01:58,504
You gotta make
something happen.

24
00:02:04,347 --> 00:02:05,811
Counter-punching
doesn't work for you.

25
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:07,480
You don't have the skill.

26
00:02:07,482 --> 00:02:09,118
- Thanks, Terry.
- You're welcome.

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,788
Come on, Lara!

28
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:18,661
Stop dancing, start fighting.

29
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:22,332
Yes, girl!

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,501
Come on!

31
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:37,147
Nice one, Lara!
You've got this!

32
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:43,384
- It's over.
- Isn't!

33
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:44,951
Then get out of it!

34
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:53,929
Come on, Lara! Tap out.

35
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:15,481
Don't say it.

36
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:17,117
You got whupped, girl.
You got whupped.

37
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:20,356
- Not whupped.
- Okay. Not whupped.

38
00:03:20,555 --> 00:03:23,057
Marmalized.

39
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:27,759
"Marmalized"? She's not
a freakin' superhero.

40
00:03:27,761 --> 00:03:30,496
Truth is, I let her...

41
00:03:30,498 --> 00:03:31,867
We cool?

42
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:34,237
Yeah, we're cool.

43
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:39,140
Was fun actually!

44
00:03:39,142 --> 00:03:40,210
Thanks.

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,815
I'll get you next time.

46
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:49,082
I'll marmalize you.

47
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:52,485
You're home early
tonight, right?

48
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:54,454
Yup.

49
00:03:54,456 --> 00:03:56,256
Catch you later.

50
00:03:56,258 --> 00:03:57,456
Laters.

51
00:03:57,458 --> 00:03:59,694
Hey! Who stole my apple?

52
00:04:02,498 --> 00:04:05,165
Should've known it was you.

53
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:06,999
Why would I do
a thing like that?

54
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:09,336
'Cause you can't afford
your own.

55
00:04:09,338 --> 00:04:11,372
Just seen you're behind
with your payments.

56
00:04:11,374 --> 00:04:13,740
Terry, look, I'll catch up
on the payments, I promise.

57
00:04:13,742 --> 00:04:15,611
I'll make it up to you.

58
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,048
Get a job, Lara.

59
00:04:20,082 --> 00:04:22,814
Do you think I'm dressed
like this for fun?

60
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:26,156
I like you, Lara.
I really do, but...

61
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:06,793
- Hey.
- Hi.

62
00:05:06,795 --> 00:05:09,029
- All good?
- Yeah. Havin' a great day.

63
00:05:09,031 --> 00:05:10,033
You?

64
00:05:11,334 --> 00:05:13,166
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

65
00:05:13,168 --> 00:05:16,804
Ask her more. Ask her for
dinner or something. Do it.

66
00:05:17,072 --> 00:05:18,471
Come on.

67
00:05:18,473 --> 00:05:19,674
Anything else?

68
00:05:21,144 --> 00:05:22,778
No, no, no.

69
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:30,284
What is your problem?
Why didn't you ask her?

70
00:05:30,286 --> 00:05:31,686
Stupid boy.

71
00:05:41,329 --> 00:05:42,862
You got that fox hunt
sorted, Rog?

72
00:05:42,864 --> 00:05:44,831
Yeah, more or less.

73
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,867
Got 30 hounds signed up.
Just gotta find a fox now.

74
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,836
- Tough one, that.
- Mmm.

75
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,371
Need someone quick enough
to make it interesting.

76
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,207
Yeah. No fun
if they ain't quick.

77
00:05:53,209 --> 00:05:54,974
But dumb enough
to think they can win.

78
00:05:54,976 --> 00:05:56,909
What are you two plotting?

79
00:05:56,911 --> 00:05:59,145
We're gonna do a fox hunt.

80
00:05:59,147 --> 00:06:01,015
- A what?
- Well, it's like a race.

81
00:06:01,017 --> 00:06:02,781
Except the fox gets
a head start,

82
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:04,318
leavin' a paint trail
behind his bike.

83
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,884
For the baying hounds
to follow.

84
00:06:05,886 --> 00:06:07,653
And if they haven't caught him

85
00:06:07,655 --> 00:06:08,989
by the time
the paint runs out...

86
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:10,111
He wins all the money.

87
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:12,492
How much money?

88
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:14,163
600 quid.

89
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,797
I think you just
found yourself a fox.

90
00:06:21,703 --> 00:06:23,102
Oh, you're bein' serious?

91
00:06:23,104 --> 00:06:24,737
Not quick or dumb enough
for you?

92
00:06:24,739 --> 00:06:26,409
No, I mean, I just...

93
00:06:28,509 --> 00:06:29,909
You're on.

94
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:31,877
"Hide fox, and all after!"

95
00:06:31,879 --> 00:06:33,914
Ooh, Shakespeare?

96
00:06:33,916 --> 00:06:35,816
<i>Hamlet,</i> is it?

97
00:06:35,818 --> 00:06:37,682
Don't know.
Things just stick in my brain.

98
00:06:37,684 --> 00:06:39,352
You know it's <i>Hamlet.</i>

99
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:40,955
And I ask you once again,

100
00:06:40,957 --> 00:06:43,190
why on earth
are you a bike courier?

101
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:44,394
You, Bruce.

102
00:06:45,826 --> 00:06:48,096
I wanna be close to you.

103
00:07:16,358 --> 00:07:20,692
Five, four, three,
two, one! Go!

104
00:07:30,372 --> 00:07:31,407
Hey!

105
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:56,365
Excuse me!

106
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:23,891
Go, go, go!

107
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:28,029
Where is she, bro?

108
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,473
<i>I won't be long,
my love.</i>

109
00:09:25,253 --> 00:09:28,587
- Oi! Watch where you're going!
- Use your mirrors!

110
00:09:36,564 --> 00:09:38,664
Go! Go!

111
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,144
Fancy seeing you here.

112
00:09:50,444 --> 00:09:51,777
Ana.

113
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:53,313
You didn't have to come.

114
00:09:53,315 --> 00:09:55,547
I don't need
a guardian anymore.

115
00:09:55,549 --> 00:09:56,985
Really?

116
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:00,156
Have you been decorating?

117
00:10:04,193 --> 00:10:06,226
Haven't seen you
for a long time.

118
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:08,330
You've never seen me.

119
00:10:12,867 --> 00:10:14,304
I'm sorry.

120
00:10:16,071 --> 00:10:17,704
Thanks for coming.

121
00:10:18,073 --> 00:10:19,708
What was today about?

122
00:10:21,042 --> 00:10:22,642
I needed the money.

123
00:10:22,644 --> 00:10:25,245
No, you don't.
There's an inheritance

124
00:10:25,247 --> 00:10:26,947
waiting for you
if only you would step...

125
00:10:26,949 --> 00:10:28,151
I won't.

126
00:10:30,252 --> 00:10:32,321
It's been seven years, Lara.

127
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:37,590
Tokyo police stopped looking
for your father

128
00:10:37,592 --> 00:10:40,059
five years ago.

129
00:10:40,061 --> 00:10:43,631
Private investigators won't
even take our money anymore.

130
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:46,933
I know it's difficult
to accept.

131
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:49,936
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.

132
00:10:49,938 --> 00:10:52,939
Hmm. That's why you came.

133
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:56,442
No. I came for you.

134
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,677
Just think what you can do
for the world,

135
00:10:58,679 --> 00:11:00,778
with your potential,
with your wealth.

136
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,085
His wealth. Not mine.

137
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:08,488
Listen, it's very simple...

138
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:10,623
If you don't sign the papers,

139
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,726
then everything your father
worked for will be sold off.

140
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:16,598
Not just the company,

141
00:11:17,832 --> 00:11:19,701
but Croft Manor, also.

142
00:11:22,502 --> 00:11:25,773
Can you imagine how he would
feel if you lost the house?

143
00:11:30,645 --> 00:11:34,280
Lara, your father's gone.

144
00:11:34,282 --> 00:11:37,518
But you can pick up
where he left off.

145
00:11:38,752 --> 00:11:40,288
It's in your blood.

146
00:11:45,593 --> 00:11:46,727
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:50,699
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.

148
00:12:08,817 --> 00:12:11,817
<i>But I don't
want you to go, Daddy.</i>

149
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:13,588
I won't be long, my love.

150
00:12:15,357 --> 00:12:17,357
You must understand.

151
00:12:17,359 --> 00:12:21,260
We Crofts, we have
responsibilities, jobs to do.

152
00:12:21,262 --> 00:12:22,962
But I'll miss you.

153
00:12:22,964 --> 00:12:25,464
I know. I'll miss you, too.

154
00:12:25,466 --> 00:12:27,469
But I may have
a solution to that.

155
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,436
See this?

156
00:12:30,438 --> 00:12:33,273
This was your mother's,
so it has special powers.

157
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,141
What do you mean?

158
00:12:35,143 --> 00:12:36,909
Ever you want to feel close
to someone,

159
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,512
just put it in your hand,
and you hold it tightly.

160
00:12:39,514 --> 00:12:42,715
And you think of that person,
and they'll know.

161
00:12:42,717 --> 00:12:44,387
- Really?
- Yeah.

162
00:12:45,253 --> 00:12:46,953
It's magic.

163
00:12:46,955 --> 00:12:49,055
And it means
that we'll always be together,

164
00:12:49,057 --> 00:12:50,891
wherever I am.

165
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,261
Okay?

166
00:13:00,268 --> 00:13:02,404
I'll be back
before you know I'm gone.

167
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:32,267
Oi!

168
00:13:33,301 --> 00:13:35,034
Couriers round the back.

169
00:13:35,036 --> 00:13:37,272
Uh, I'm not a courier.

170
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:39,371
Well, I am.

171
00:13:39,373 --> 00:13:41,843
Right. So round the back.

172
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:50,816
I'm here to see Ana Miller.

173
00:13:50,818 --> 00:13:53,386
Well, you gotta
sign in like everyone else.

174
00:13:53,388 --> 00:13:54,854
What's your name?

175
00:13:54,856 --> 00:13:56,688
Lara.

176
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,091
Lara.

177
00:13:58,093 --> 00:13:59,660
Croft.

178
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:06,299
The pages
that require a signature

179
00:14:06,301 --> 00:14:09,204
are marked
for your convenience.

180
00:14:10,804 --> 00:14:12,338
Would you like Mr. Yaffe

181
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,740
to take you
through the particulars?

182
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,179
I gather I sign

183
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:19,644
and Dad is dead.

184
00:14:19,646 --> 00:14:22,783
I can imagine
how difficult this is for you.

185
00:14:25,786 --> 00:14:27,454
I miss him, too.

186
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,005
That was Dad's.

187
00:14:45,007 --> 00:14:48,173
Yes, Miss Croft.
According to Richard's will,

188
00:14:48,175 --> 00:14:50,910
in the event of his death

189
00:14:50,912 --> 00:14:52,611
I was to give it to you.

190
00:14:52,613 --> 00:14:56,418
<i>Karakuri.</i> Japanese puzzle.

191
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:59,218
Um, technically speaking,

192
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,855
you're meant to sign
the papers first.

193
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:07,826
I could never understand

194
00:15:07,828 --> 00:15:10,163
your father's obsession
with those things.

195
00:15:10,165 --> 00:15:12,265
Wouldn't believe
how many of these

196
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:13,831
were lying around the house.

197
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,968
There was gonna be
some purpose to it.

198
00:15:48,703 --> 00:15:52,471
"The first letter
from my final destination."

199
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:55,344
But he didn't leave a letter.

200
00:16:02,683 --> 00:16:05,320
- If you'll excuse me.
- Lara, I...

201
00:16:54,335 --> 00:16:56,537
"My final destination."

202
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:06,082
The first letter.

203
00:18:07,308 --> 00:18:08,542
What the...

204
00:18:34,634 --> 00:18:36,603
Dad, what were you up to?

205
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:51,150
<i>Hello, sprout.</i>

206
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:53,718
<i>I knew I could trust you
to solve my puzzle.</i>

207
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,688
<i>Unfortunately, if you're
watching this tape,</i>

208
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,860
<i>then, uh, it means
that I must be dead.</i>

209
00:19:00,862 --> 00:19:02,695
<i>It'll be obvious to you by now</i>

210
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:04,697
<i>that there was more to my life</i>

211
00:19:04,699 --> 00:19:06,764
<i>than just boardrooms
and business deals.</i>

212
00:19:06,766 --> 00:19:09,936
<i>Things that I couldn't
tell you about before.</i>

213
00:19:09,938 --> 00:19:14,040
<i>When your mother died,
grief nearly destroyed me.</i>

214
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:16,109
<i>I began searching the world,</i>

215
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:20,213
<i>desperate for a hint
of another realm,</i>

216
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:24,284
<i>for proof that
the supernatural is real.</i>

217
00:19:24,286 --> 00:19:28,055
<i>Anything to feel her
with me again.</i>

218
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:31,625
<i>I made quite
a hobby of it, sprout.</i>

219
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,326
<i>Now...</i>

220
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:36,295
<i>I need you to do me a favor.</i>

221
00:19:36,297 --> 00:19:39,430
<i>I need you to burn
all my research</i>

222
00:19:39,432 --> 00:19:40,698
<i>on the Himiko project.</i>

223
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,635
<i>Just burn all of it.</i>

224
00:19:42,637 --> 00:19:44,204
<i>The notebooks,
the tapes, everything.</i>

225
00:19:44,206 --> 00:19:45,906
<i>It's very important.</i>

226
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:47,540
<i>If it falls
into the wrong hands,</i>

227
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:48,975
<i>then it could be catastrophic,</i>

228
00:19:48,977 --> 00:19:51,178
<i>so please do it straightaway.</i>

229
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:54,478
<i>I know you hate
being told what to do,</i>

230
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,184
<i>but please promise me that.</i>

231
00:19:57,186 --> 00:20:00,188
<i>I hope you never
have to see this tape.</i>

232
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:03,223
<i>But if you do,</i>

233
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:05,727
<i>you've found
my secret calling.</i>

234
00:20:08,229 --> 00:20:10,065
<i>I hope you find yours.</i>

235
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,539
Dad loves you.

236
00:20:41,862 --> 00:20:43,265
"Himiko."

237
00:20:53,107 --> 00:20:55,140
<i>October 5th.</i>

238
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,944
<i>They called Queen Himiko
the "Mother of Death."</i>

239
00:20:57,946 --> 00:20:59,844
<i>All the stories about her</i>

240
00:20:59,846 --> 00:21:01,780
<i>end in rivers
running red with blood.</i>

241
00:21:01,782 --> 00:21:04,985
<i>Bewitching people,
controlling minds,</i>

242
00:21:04,987 --> 00:21:06,851
<i>spreading death
and destruction</i>

243
00:21:06,853 --> 00:21:08,520
<i>with just
the touch of her hand.</i>

244
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:10,488
<i>The bloodshed only ended</i>

245
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:13,159
<i>when her own generals
buried her alive in a tomb,</i>

246
00:21:13,161 --> 00:21:15,427
<i>sealing her away
from the outside world,</i>

247
00:21:15,429 --> 00:21:18,098
<i>on an island
no one could reach.</i>

248
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,666
<i>History's all but erased
its existence.</i>

249
00:21:21,668 --> 00:21:24,339
<i>The lost island of Yamatai.</i>

250
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,375
<i>I'm certain this is the place.</i>

251
00:21:28,775 --> 00:21:31,577
<i>July 29th, 2011.</i>

252
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:33,312
<i>I finally found a captain</i>

253
00:21:33,314 --> 00:21:35,348
<i>willing to take me
to the island.</i>

254
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,118
<i>I must get there first
to ensure her powers</i>

255
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,021
<i>will never fall
into the wrong hands.</i>

256
00:21:57,271 --> 00:21:59,072
Uh...

257
00:21:59,074 --> 00:22:01,473
That amulet was given
to my father

258
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:04,412
by Emperor Showa of Japan.

259
00:22:04,844 --> 00:22:07,112
Right. Right. Well...

260
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:09,613
This ain't from Japan.

261
00:22:09,615 --> 00:22:11,317
You're correct.

262
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,085
Emperor Showa
was given it by the grandson

263
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:14,852
of the former emperor
of Maratha.

264
00:22:14,854 --> 00:22:17,856
"Maratha"? You're having
a laugh, in't ya?

265
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,658
And he, himself,
got it from Thibaw,

266
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,026
the last king of Burma

267
00:22:21,028 --> 00:22:22,861
when he was exiled in India.

268
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,896
- "Exiled in India."
- Mmm.

269
00:22:24,898 --> 00:22:26,764
What a fascinating tale.

270
00:22:26,766 --> 00:22:28,832
And you got
all this, uh, provenance

271
00:22:28,834 --> 00:22:30,468
down on paper, do ya?

272
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:32,170
If I had
the provenance on paper,

273
00:22:32,172 --> 00:22:34,239
I'd be at Christie's,
wouldn't I?

274
00:22:34,241 --> 00:22:36,409
But, um...

275
00:22:36,411 --> 00:22:38,311
This is your lucky day.

276
00:22:38,313 --> 00:22:39,844
Is it?

277
00:22:39,846 --> 00:22:41,413
Alan!
What have I told you

278
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:43,416
about flirting
with the customers?

279
00:22:43,418 --> 00:22:44,984
I'm not flirting. I'm just
naturally charismatic.

280
00:22:44,986 --> 00:22:46,388
I was not flirting. I'm sorry.

281
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,554
I was flirting.

282
00:22:49,556 --> 00:22:50,891
Have a look.

283
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,898
Big smiles, nice and casual.

284
00:23:00,901 --> 00:23:02,802
Right, well,
I'm pleased to say

285
00:23:02,804 --> 00:23:05,207
we're in a position
to make you an offer.

286
00:23:07,409 --> 00:23:08,443
Ten.

287
00:23:11,379 --> 00:23:12,780
Please?

288
00:23:13,914 --> 00:23:15,715
Just a tad bit more.

289
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:17,849
That's all I have
to remember my dad by.

290
00:23:17,851 --> 00:23:20,585
Oh. Oh, your dad died.

291
00:23:20,587 --> 00:23:23,188
That's a shame.
It's a terrible thing

292
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,957
for a young woman
to lose her father.

293
00:23:24,959 --> 00:23:27,127
Really. All right.
Fair enough.

294
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:28,862
9,000.

295
00:23:29,296 --> 00:23:30,527
You just said 10.

296
00:23:30,529 --> 00:23:32,098
Well, people come in here

297
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,864
trying the dead dad shit
all the time.

298
00:23:33,866 --> 00:23:35,434
And you fall for it
all the time.

299
00:23:35,436 --> 00:23:37,236
I don't fall for it
all the time.

300
00:23:37,238 --> 00:23:38,637
Last week,
you fell for it twice.

301
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:39,771
I fell for it twice.

302
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:41,505
It's the truth.

303
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,243
Fine. I'm happy
to keep negotiating.

304
00:23:43,245 --> 00:23:44,445
Because now
the price is eight.

305
00:23:46,146 --> 00:23:48,847
- Okay. You win.
- Ah, finally.

306
00:23:48,849 --> 00:23:51,082
Thank you. Really.

307
00:23:51,084 --> 00:23:52,850
Thank you.

308
00:23:52,852 --> 00:23:55,456
For just
such occasions.

309
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:00,492
For just such occasions.

310
00:24:00,494 --> 00:24:01,994
You burnt me taters!

311
00:24:01,996 --> 00:24:03,396
Sort yourself out, Alan.
Seriously.

312
00:24:03,398 --> 00:24:04,398
That is hot coffee.

313
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:41,967
Excuse me,
do you speak English?

314
00:24:41,969 --> 00:24:43,804
Sorry, no.

315
00:24:44,705 --> 00:24:46,942
No? Thank you.

316
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:50,609
Sorry. Excuse me.

317
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:54,514
Do you know a Lu Ren? Lu Ren?

318
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:56,850
Not even a tiny bit?

319
00:25:00,354 --> 00:25:02,687
- Do you speak English?
- Lady.

320
00:25:02,689 --> 00:25:03,991
You need help?

321
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:08,194
Yes. I do.

322
00:25:08,196 --> 00:25:11,965
I'm looking
for this guy called Lu Ren.

323
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:13,698
Um, he's supposed to...

324
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,801
- Lu Ren boat.
- Yes.

325
00:25:15,803 --> 00:25:17,269
<i>Endurance.</i> Over there.

326
00:25:17,271 --> 00:25:18,940
<i>"Endurance"?</i> Which one?

327
00:25:21,176 --> 00:25:22,311
Oi!

328
00:25:23,577 --> 00:25:24,912
Wait!

329
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:23,034
Stay back.

330
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:28,642
Gimme the bag.

331
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:42,991
You just lost your tip.

332
00:26:45,026 --> 00:26:46,427
You just lose your tongue.

333
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,434
Lu! Lu Ren!

334
00:27:28,436 --> 00:27:30,171
Help! Help!

335
00:27:45,452 --> 00:27:47,487
Run! Run! He's drunk again!

336
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:53,061
Thank you.

337
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:58,428
What?

338
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,032
I said what
are you doing on my boat?

339
00:28:00,034 --> 00:28:01,632
I'm not with them.

340
00:28:01,634 --> 00:28:03,668
I'm looking for a man
named Lu Ren.

341
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:07,438
Congratulations, you found me.
Now get lost.

342
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,376
Please. Wait.
Just listen. I need...

343
00:28:10,378 --> 00:28:12,111
Okay, let's go.

344
00:28:12,113 --> 00:28:13,211
I'm not here
to make any trouble.

345
00:28:13,213 --> 00:28:15,114
Keep walking.

346
00:28:15,116 --> 00:28:17,015
Could you please
put that gun down and just...

347
00:28:20,786 --> 00:28:22,324
Oh, for God's sake.

348
00:28:25,557 --> 00:28:29,427
My father, Richard Croft,
tried to buy a boat from you.

349
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:32,563
No. No. Not me, he didn't.

350
00:28:32,565 --> 00:28:33,800
Yes, he did.

351
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:38,271
Your name is Lu Ren.

352
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:40,208
This is from you.

353
00:28:40,874 --> 00:28:44,876
Yes, I know my name, thanks.

354
00:28:44,878 --> 00:28:48,913
It's the same as my father's,
and he wrote that, not me.

355
00:28:51,352 --> 00:28:53,319
Well, then I need
to talk to him.

356
00:28:53,321 --> 00:28:55,353
You and 100 other people
he owed money...

357
00:28:55,355 --> 00:28:58,556
- Where is he?
- I don't know, okay?

358
00:28:58,558 --> 00:29:00,559
One day,
he just left on his boat,

359
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:03,198
and I never saw him again,
all right?

360
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:08,303
Was this seven years ago?

361
00:29:12,439 --> 00:29:16,374
I think I know
where they went. Our dads.

362
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:19,344
To the bottom
of the sea?

363
00:29:19,346 --> 00:29:22,647
They were headed
to an uninhabited island.

364
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:25,383
Somewhere off the coast
of Japan.

365
00:29:25,385 --> 00:29:27,554
It used to be called Yamatai.

366
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:31,456
I'm gonna go there
and find out

367
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,992
what happened to them.

368
00:29:32,994 --> 00:29:34,626
Good luck. There's at least

369
00:29:34,628 --> 00:29:36,427
6,000 islands
off the coast of Japan,

370
00:29:36,429 --> 00:29:38,397
and hardly any of them
are populated.

371
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,431
Well, I have a map.

372
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:43,902
Now, all I need to do is to
figure out what these are.

373
00:29:43,904 --> 00:29:46,373
I think these are coordinates.

374
00:29:46,672 --> 00:29:48,242
The location.

375
00:29:52,979 --> 00:29:54,780
They're clock hands.

376
00:29:55,582 --> 00:29:58,516
They're not
clock hands.

377
00:29:58,518 --> 00:30:00,887
Definitely not
clock hands. They're...

378
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,727
They are clock hands.

379
00:30:14,801 --> 00:30:16,238
Three...

380
00:30:21,342 --> 00:30:23,675
That's the one.

381
00:30:23,677 --> 00:30:26,744
That's right in the middle
of the Devil's Sea.

382
00:30:26,746 --> 00:30:28,346
You might as well
tie a stone to your foot

383
00:30:28,348 --> 00:30:29,880
and jump off the boat now.

384
00:30:29,882 --> 00:30:31,482
It'll be an adventure.

385
00:30:31,484 --> 00:30:34,919
Death is not an adventure.

386
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:36,754
Don't you want to know
what happened to them?

387
00:30:36,756 --> 00:30:40,491
I just don't care
anymore, okay?

388
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:43,298
Look, I'm a busy guy.
I got stuff to do.

389
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,716
How much did you lose
last night?

390
00:31:04,286 --> 00:31:06,284
What makes you think I lost?

391
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:07,851
Well, it looked like you were

392
00:31:07,853 --> 00:31:10,790
drowning your sorrows,
not celebrating.

393
00:31:28,542 --> 00:31:31,243
Yours if you help me
get to Yamatai.

394
00:31:31,245 --> 00:31:33,647
And what will I spend it on,
a coffin?

395
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:36,581
Then I'll go and get myself

396
00:31:36,583 --> 00:31:38,316
two rust buckets like this
with that.

397
00:31:38,318 --> 00:31:41,453
Even if you had a boat,
or two,

398
00:31:41,455 --> 00:31:43,457
you'd sink 'em before
you even left the harbor.

399
00:31:44,991 --> 00:31:47,760
What you need
is an experienced captain.

400
00:31:51,332 --> 00:31:53,434
So, what's in the other shoe?

401
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,910
<i>June 23rd.</i>

402
00:32:05,912 --> 00:32:08,879
<i>I may have found
the next piece to the puzzle.</i>

403
00:32:08,881 --> 00:32:11,616
<i>Ancient drawings hint
to the location of the tomb</i>

404
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:14,820
<i>and an elaborate door
to keep her contained.</i>

405
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:18,256
<i>I've found a way
to decipher the codes.</i>

406
00:32:18,258 --> 00:32:20,526
<i>I'm sure I can get to her.</i>

407
00:32:29,003 --> 00:32:31,468
<i>The ancient
Nihongi chronicles state</i>

408
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,372
<i>that within the tomb,</i>

409
00:32:33,374 --> 00:32:36,507
<i>one must face
the "Ordeals of Himiko."</i>

410
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:39,776
<i>Cross the Chasm of Souls,</i>

411
00:32:39,778 --> 00:32:43,017
<i>pray to survive
the faces of Himiko,</i>

412
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:50,022
<i>behold her army
of a thousand handmaidens,</i>

413
00:32:50,024 --> 00:32:52,690
<i>descend upon
Himiko's final resting place,</i>

414
00:32:52,692 --> 00:32:54,962
<i>unleashing her scourge.</i>

415
00:33:05,973 --> 00:33:07,906
<i>July 6th. I'm convinced</i>

416
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:09,775
<i>that my progress
is being monitored.</i>

417
00:33:10,344 --> 00:33:12,143
<i>I know them by name now...</i>

418
00:33:12,145 --> 00:33:13,878
<i>The Order of Trinity.</i>

419
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:15,948
<i>An ancient
militant organization</i>

420
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:18,815
<i>that seeks control
over the supernatural</i>

421
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:21,119
<i>to rule the fate of mankind.</i>

422
00:33:21,121 --> 00:33:23,455
<i>What if Himiko is the weapon</i>

423
00:33:23,457 --> 00:33:25,659
<i>that Trinity has been seeking?</i>

424
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:36,804
Can't sleep?

425
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:43,411
It's beautiful.

426
00:33:46,247 --> 00:33:48,112
Enjoy it
while you can.

427
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:49,982
We're headed into the most
dangerous stretch of water

428
00:33:49,984 --> 00:33:52,686
between Hong Kong
and California.

429
00:33:53,753 --> 00:33:56,457
Your dad sure knew
how to pick a holiday.

430
00:33:58,725 --> 00:34:02,862
Yeah. He had a knack for
the unexpected. Apparently.

431
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:09,400
I am starting to wonder
if he'd gone mad, though.

432
00:34:11,238 --> 00:34:13,870
He didn't seem to know what
was real and what wasn't,

433
00:34:13,872 --> 00:34:18,477
obsessing over some
ancient Japanese death queen.

434
00:34:18,479 --> 00:34:21,080
Hey, some men
like dangerous women.

435
00:34:21,082 --> 00:34:23,915
Some men are foolish.

436
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:25,550
What?

437
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:29,089
Good night, Lu Ren.
Sweet dreams.

438
00:34:45,406 --> 00:34:47,339
Not William Tell yet,
but you're close.

439
00:34:47,341 --> 00:34:49,541
William Tell was a myth, Dad.

440
00:34:49,543 --> 00:34:52,413
Well, all myths
have foundation in reality.

441
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,348
I have to head off, sprout.

442
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:57,114
But you've only
just come back.

443
00:34:57,116 --> 00:34:59,652
- I'll be back before...
- I even know you're gone.

444
00:35:01,521 --> 00:35:03,355
Ana will keep an eye on you.

445
00:35:03,357 --> 00:35:05,689
I don't need one of
your employees babysitting me.

446
00:35:05,691 --> 00:35:07,795
I can take care of myself.

447
00:35:13,134 --> 00:35:14,568
My girl.

448
00:35:17,036 --> 00:35:18,205
Lara

449
00:35:23,178 --> 00:35:24,978
Never forget Dad loves you.

450
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:27,182
I know.

451
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,561
Thought that might wake you.

452
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,998
Your island's found us.

453
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:24,071
Yamatai.

454
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:39,584
We've lost all control!

455
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:41,785
- We need to abandon ship.
- What?

456
00:36:41,787 --> 00:36:43,521
We're dead
in the water.

457
00:36:43,523 --> 00:36:45,056
It's not gonna hold
much longer.

458
00:36:45,058 --> 00:36:46,338
We need to get off
this boat now.

459
00:37:02,343 --> 00:37:03,544
Wait!

460
00:37:04,644 --> 00:37:06,178
Dad's papers!

461
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,283
Forget them! Lara!

462
00:37:22,595 --> 00:37:23,830
Oh!

463
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:31,139
Lara. Come on!

464
00:37:38,379 --> 00:37:39,613
Lu!

465
00:37:51,724 --> 00:37:53,328
The lifeboat!

466
00:38:17,749 --> 00:38:19,086
Watch out!

467
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:55,423
Lu!

468
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,658
Lu!

469
00:40:14,733 --> 00:40:16,136
Where am I?

470
00:40:18,537 --> 00:40:21,439
Ah! She's awake.

471
00:40:21,441 --> 00:40:24,145
I was beginning
to get worried about you.

472
00:40:31,152 --> 00:40:32,186
A reef.

473
00:40:33,254 --> 00:40:35,018
You hit it.

474
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,087
Thank God I found you.

475
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:39,991
Most people who try to
come here die in the currents.

476
00:40:39,993 --> 00:40:42,695
Almost impossible to get here.

477
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:45,132
Even harder to leave.

478
00:40:49,303 --> 00:40:50,404
Where's my...

479
00:40:56,876 --> 00:40:58,145
Right here.

480
00:41:04,883 --> 00:41:08,055
What are you doing here, Lara?

481
00:41:11,791 --> 00:41:14,058
I have two daughters.

482
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:15,930
Dark hair like you.

483
00:41:16,931 --> 00:41:18,865
Pretty like you.

484
00:41:23,404 --> 00:41:27,105
Forgive me. Rude.

485
00:41:27,107 --> 00:41:28,805
I haven't hosted a guest
here in a very long time.

486
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:31,477
My name is Mathias Vogel.

487
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,250
You must be hungry.

488
00:41:41,588 --> 00:41:43,257
You know, I used to imagine

489
00:41:44,456 --> 00:41:46,524
that I might find an ear

490
00:41:46,526 --> 00:41:49,163
inside one of
those cans eventually.

491
00:41:50,896 --> 00:41:53,397
Isn't that mad?

492
00:41:53,399 --> 00:41:55,767
I guess being on this island
for so long

493
00:41:55,769 --> 00:41:58,568
can make you a little crazy.

494
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:01,205
The only person
that I get to talk to

495
00:42:01,207 --> 00:42:03,942
is on the other end
of this phone.

496
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:06,843
And they always say
the same thing...

497
00:42:06,845 --> 00:42:10,283
I can't go home until
my work on the island is done.

498
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:23,261
What kind of work do you do?

499
00:42:23,263 --> 00:42:27,199
Oh, a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.

500
00:42:52,926 --> 00:42:54,593
You looking for this?

501
00:42:57,196 --> 00:43:00,367
The machinations of fate
never cease to amaze me.

502
00:43:02,201 --> 00:43:04,470
"The door to Himiko."

503
00:43:06,871 --> 00:43:08,674
Richard had the entrance.

504
00:43:12,044 --> 00:43:13,914
All that wasted time.

505
00:43:16,984 --> 00:43:18,548
You have brought me the thing

506
00:43:18,550 --> 00:43:21,584
that I most wanted
in this world.

507
00:43:21,586 --> 00:43:22,621
Thank you.

508
00:43:25,724 --> 00:43:28,328
What do you know
about my father?

509
00:43:32,098 --> 00:43:33,998
Now I see the likeness.

510
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,501
The intelligence in the face.

511
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:39,406
The recklessness.

512
00:43:45,379 --> 00:43:47,443
All he had to do
was cooperate.

513
00:43:47,445 --> 00:43:50,448
Of course, being Richard,
he refused.

514
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:52,920
Thought he was saving
the world.

515
00:43:53,187 --> 00:43:54,688
Where is he?

516
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:00,926
Where is he?

517
00:44:00,928 --> 00:44:03,297
He's with God now.
I killed him.

518
00:44:07,767 --> 00:44:11,405
I'm sorry if I was too blunt.
I'm out of practice.

519
00:44:12,038 --> 00:44:14,175
It's been seven years.

520
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:17,211
Seven years.

521
00:44:30,655 --> 00:44:32,156
Come on.

522
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:33,525
Come on, come on!

523
00:44:34,726 --> 00:44:36,595
Come on. Get down there.

524
00:44:42,937 --> 00:44:44,671
Get those skids moving!

525
00:44:49,009 --> 00:44:50,441
Move.

526
00:44:50,443 --> 00:44:51,611
Move!

527
00:44:53,813 --> 00:44:55,514
Let's go!

528
00:44:55,915 --> 00:44:57,747
Pick it up!

529
00:44:57,749 --> 00:44:59,386
Come on, go!

530
00:45:02,588 --> 00:45:04,124
Tie her up!

531
00:45:15,902 --> 00:45:18,071
Okay, winch it up!

532
00:45:19,838 --> 00:45:21,307
Back to work.

533
00:45:22,742 --> 00:45:25,143
Lara Croft.

534
00:45:25,145 --> 00:45:27,613
You shouldn't have come here.

535
00:45:28,247 --> 00:45:30,250
But I'm glad that you did.

536
00:45:32,386 --> 00:45:35,922
Pack it up. We're moving camp!

537
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:42,858
- All right, let's pack it up!
- Okay, move out!

538
00:45:42,860 --> 00:45:44,630
We're moving camp!

539
00:45:51,804 --> 00:45:54,274
Keep it moving!
You, move!

540
00:45:55,308 --> 00:45:56,575
Move it, move it.

541
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,419
Pick it up! Come on, let's go!

542
00:46:08,421 --> 00:46:10,922
Who are these people?

543
00:46:10,924 --> 00:46:14,393
Some are
shipwrecked fishermen.

544
00:46:14,395 --> 00:46:17,129
And some paid smugglers
to take 'em to a better life.

545
00:46:17,131 --> 00:46:19,232
Instead,
they brought 'em here.

546
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:23,234
Come on!
We're backed up here. Move!

547
00:46:23,236 --> 00:46:25,472
He said he killed my dad.

548
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:30,276
He killed mine.

549
00:46:31,277 --> 00:46:32,512
They saw it.

550
00:46:33,713 --> 00:46:36,183
Cold-blooded murder.

551
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:37,851
I'm sorry.

552
00:46:40,154 --> 00:46:43,620
I'm sorry
that I brought you here.

553
00:46:43,622 --> 00:46:47,459
Well, you did take advantage
of a drunken sailor.

554
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:51,295
Come on, move!

555
00:46:51,297 --> 00:46:53,599
At least we're not dead yet.

556
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:55,201
No shit.

557
00:47:42,216 --> 00:47:44,285
I need
some CL 20 up here!

558
00:47:57,163 --> 00:47:58,463
Come on, let's go!

559
00:48:08,075 --> 00:48:10,441
You okay?

560
00:48:10,443 --> 00:48:12,009
Get him up and back to work
right now.

561
00:48:12,011 --> 00:48:13,811
Hang on.

562
00:48:13,813 --> 00:48:15,773
- Right now!
- Let him rest. We'll manage.

563
00:48:18,118 --> 00:48:19,615
Get him back
to work right now!

564
00:48:19,617 --> 00:48:22,020
He's sick, man.
He needs to rest.

565
00:49:18,443 --> 00:49:21,078
Get back to work!

566
00:49:29,922 --> 00:49:32,058
You heard him!
Let's get back to work!

567
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:41,333
Hey, Lara.

568
00:49:41,335 --> 00:49:43,503
Lara! Get ready.

569
00:49:44,337 --> 00:49:45,538
Hey.

570
00:49:47,406 --> 00:49:48,738
Go!

571
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,775
Go!

572
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,463
Look out!

573
00:50:15,834 --> 00:50:17,570
Let's spread out!
Spread out!

574
00:50:34,953 --> 00:50:36,420
Get her!

575
00:50:36,422 --> 00:50:37,889
Get a move on!

576
00:50:43,561 --> 00:50:44,796
Grab her!

577
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:16,127
She's in the river.
You want us to follow?

578
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:17,695
No.

579
00:51:17,697 --> 00:51:19,931
I'm sending Rocket
to track her.

580
00:51:19,933 --> 00:51:23,569
If she survives,
he'll bring her back.

581
00:54:07,733 --> 00:54:08,969
Really?

582
00:58:24,722 --> 00:58:28,425
Easy now, easy.
I'm taking you back to camp.

583
00:58:54,085 --> 00:58:55,955
Stop struggling!

584
01:00:43,595 --> 01:00:44,596
Wait!

585
01:00:56,641 --> 01:00:58,241
No, no, no, no!

586
01:01:33,878 --> 01:01:36,445
I'm not mad.
I'm not mad, I'm not mad.

587
01:01:36,447 --> 01:01:38,683
Just ignore it. It'll go away.

588
01:02:07,445 --> 01:02:08,447
Dad?

589
01:02:11,082 --> 01:02:12,450
It's me.

590
01:02:17,789 --> 01:02:19,955
Dad?

591
01:02:19,957 --> 01:02:25,263
It's not real. Ignore it.
It'll go away. It always does.

592
01:02:25,265 --> 01:02:27,664
No, look at me, look at me.

593
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:28,801
Please.

594
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:36,474
Do you remember this?
Do you remember:

595
01:02:37,977 --> 01:02:39,379
We used to...

596
01:02:47,552 --> 01:02:48,854
It's me.

597
01:02:54,292 --> 01:02:55,760
It's Lara.

598
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,869
Sprout.

599
01:03:08,606 --> 01:03:11,243
What the blazes
are you doing here?

600
01:03:18,183 --> 01:03:19,751
Dad, I'm hurt.

601
01:03:28,393 --> 01:03:29,760
It's all right.

602
01:03:51,749 --> 01:03:53,448
This will hurt me
more than it hurts you.

603
01:03:53,450 --> 01:03:55,217
What?

604
01:03:55,219 --> 01:03:56,820
All right.

605
01:03:57,422 --> 01:03:59,891
You're all right.
You're all right.

606
01:04:01,192 --> 01:04:03,294
All right. It's all right.

607
01:04:04,163 --> 01:04:06,465
It's done.

608
01:04:18,843 --> 01:04:20,312
Rest now.

609
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:26,351
Will you stay with me?

610
01:04:28,221 --> 01:04:29,956
I'm not going anywhere.

611
01:05:02,154 --> 01:05:05,391
Vogel! We found it! Yeah!

612
01:05:08,294 --> 01:05:12,530
Yeah! Come on! We found it!

613
01:05:19,470 --> 01:05:21,270
I found it.

614
01:05:21,272 --> 01:05:23,007
Send the transport.

615
01:06:02,980 --> 01:06:04,613
I thought you'd gone.

616
01:06:04,615 --> 01:06:06,016
Usually when I see you
on this island,

617
01:06:06,018 --> 01:06:07,519
it's you who disappears.

618
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,843
Let me do that.

619
01:06:34,113 --> 01:06:35,447
Come here.

620
01:06:41,818 --> 01:06:44,755
So, sprout,
where did you end up?

621
01:06:45,523 --> 01:06:47,926
Did you go
to Oxford or Cambridge?

622
01:06:50,628 --> 01:06:52,695
Come on, which was it?

623
01:06:52,697 --> 01:06:54,532
You know what, Dad?

624
01:06:55,633 --> 01:06:58,668
I didn't go to university.

625
01:06:58,670 --> 01:07:02,371
Well, there's time yet.
You're still only a child.

626
01:07:02,373 --> 01:07:06,342
No, I was a child
when you left me.

627
01:07:06,344 --> 01:07:07,713
Ah, careful.

628
01:07:15,753 --> 01:07:18,720
Hardest day of my life

629
01:07:18,722 --> 01:07:21,425
when I gave up
trying to get back to you.

630
01:07:25,630 --> 01:07:28,432
But I realized
she'd never let me leave.

631
01:07:31,702 --> 01:07:35,375
What are you talking about?
Who's "she"?

632
01:07:35,773 --> 01:07:37,042
Himiko.

633
01:07:38,977 --> 01:07:42,179
Trinity had sent Vogel
to find her tomb

634
01:07:42,181 --> 01:07:44,646
so that he could wake her
and get her power.

635
01:07:44,648 --> 01:07:46,584
I had to stop them.

636
01:07:48,321 --> 01:07:50,586
Right.

637
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:53,324
Vogel can't find the tomb
without me.

638
01:07:53,326 --> 01:07:55,892
And since I'm dead

639
01:07:55,894 --> 01:07:58,998
and since you've burnt
the rest of my research,

640
01:07:59,597 --> 01:08:01,466
he'll never find it.

641
01:08:03,236 --> 01:08:04,468
So...

642
01:08:06,138 --> 01:08:07,671
About that.

643
01:08:09,773 --> 01:08:11,740
What part of
"burn all my papers"

644
01:08:11,742 --> 01:08:13,876
did you not understand?

645
01:08:13,878 --> 01:08:17,414
If I'd burned the papers,
I wouldn't have found you.

646
01:08:17,416 --> 01:08:20,883
I set diversions and false
leads wherever I could.

647
01:08:20,885 --> 01:08:23,519
I watched for years
as they got it wrong.

648
01:08:23,521 --> 01:08:25,355
And now you lead them
by the hand.

649
01:08:25,357 --> 01:08:29,628
So a gun-toting psychopath
finds some ancient remains.

650
01:08:30,394 --> 01:08:32,161
So what?

651
01:08:32,163 --> 01:08:34,364
If Vogel opens that tomb,

652
01:08:34,366 --> 01:08:37,968
Himiko's curse will be
unleashed on the world.

653
01:08:37,970 --> 01:08:39,635
Dad, listen...

654
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:42,840
You coming here was a mistake.

655
01:08:48,646 --> 01:08:51,280
I came here to find out
what happened to you.

656
01:08:51,282 --> 01:08:53,118
So long as the tomb was safe,

657
01:08:53,617 --> 01:08:55,818
you were safe.

658
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,557
I was trying to keep you safe.

659
01:09:00,225 --> 01:09:01,991
But I underestimated your...

660
01:09:01,993 --> 01:09:03,129
My what?

661
01:09:05,662 --> 01:09:07,665
- Stupidity?
- No.

662
01:09:11,403 --> 01:09:13,039
Your bravery.

663
01:09:19,077 --> 01:09:21,210
We have to get off
this island.

664
01:09:21,212 --> 01:09:22,877
There's no way off, Lara.

665
01:09:22,879 --> 01:09:24,814
Vogel's got a satellite phone.

666
01:09:24,816 --> 01:09:26,582
We can get to it.
We can call for help.

667
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:28,317
Vogel has an army.

668
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:30,621
You were the one who taught me
to never give up.

669
01:09:33,925 --> 01:09:36,094
That was a different time.

670
01:09:37,595 --> 01:09:39,798
When I was a different man.

671
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:54,745
- Lara.
- Well, I'm still his daughter.

672
01:09:56,181 --> 01:09:57,516
Lara!

673
01:10:20,504 --> 01:10:21,872
Come on!

674
01:10:44,829 --> 01:10:46,595
Try another combination.

675
01:10:46,597 --> 01:10:49,699
And another one,
and another one.

676
01:10:57,910 --> 01:11:01,244
Come on. Come on,
give me the damn code.

677
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,856
Hey. We're trying
the explosives again.

678
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,392
Set another charge.

679
01:11:16,394 --> 01:11:17,796
Yes, boss.

680
01:11:40,184 --> 01:11:42,784
Get over there.
Stop talking.

681
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:58,467
Get the guns.
I'm gonna get the sat phone.

682
01:11:58,469 --> 01:12:00,735
Then we'll find a way for all
of us to get out of here.

683
01:12:00,737 --> 01:12:02,338
We need to leave now.

684
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:14,953
Vogel! They re escaping!

685
01:12:22,559 --> 01:12:24,095
Go!

686
01:12:24,495 --> 01:12:26,331
Shoot them!

687
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:44,749
- Get them to safety.
- Okay.

688
01:12:49,086 --> 01:12:51,720
I'll be right behind you. Go.

689
01:13:40,171 --> 01:13:41,703
Shit.

690
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:54,151
We have to move.

691
01:13:54,485 --> 01:13:55,818
I have to wait here.

692
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:57,189
I'm not leaving Lara behind.

693
01:14:24,248 --> 01:14:26,385
It's beautiful,
isn't it, Richard?

694
01:14:29,687 --> 01:14:31,420
I wish I would've known
that you were alive

695
01:14:31,422 --> 01:14:33,224
all these years.

696
01:14:34,158 --> 01:14:36,894
At least I would've had
somebody to talk to.

697
01:14:49,772 --> 01:14:52,040
I need your help, Richard.

698
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:54,443
Get the door open for me.

699
01:14:54,445 --> 01:14:56,678
It's been seven years.

700
01:14:56,680 --> 01:14:58,447
I'm going home
to see my family.

701
01:14:58,449 --> 01:15:01,287
If I open that tomb,
you won't have a family.

702
01:15:02,420 --> 01:15:03,922
Open it!

703
01:15:05,357 --> 01:15:06,523
Open it!

704
01:15:07,625 --> 01:15:08,827
Open it!

705
01:15:09,594 --> 01:15:10,594
Never!

706
01:15:13,830 --> 01:15:15,663
Have it your way.

707
01:15:15,665 --> 01:15:18,836
With or without you,
I'm getting inside that tomb.

708
01:15:27,412 --> 01:15:28,446
Put that down!

709
01:15:30,948 --> 01:15:32,749
Put it down.

710
01:15:33,683 --> 01:15:35,383
You don't think
I can pull this trigger

711
01:15:35,385 --> 01:15:36,986
before you hit me
with that arrow.

712
01:15:36,988 --> 01:15:38,555
Shoot him, Lara. Shoot him!

713
01:15:39,123 --> 01:15:41,057
Come on, put your weapon down.

714
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:43,329
Shoot him, Lara. We can't
let him get to Himiko.

715
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:48,497
You really don't believe
this nonsense, do you?

716
01:15:48,499 --> 01:15:52,302
Tell your father to
open the door, or he's dead.

717
01:15:52,304 --> 01:15:54,671
You can make him do it, Lara.

718
01:15:55,340 --> 01:15:57,906
Transport's already
on its way.

719
01:15:57,908 --> 01:16:00,876
We can all be
off this goddamn island.

720
01:16:00,878 --> 01:16:02,578
Let him shoot me.

721
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:05,583
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.

722
01:16:08,053 --> 01:16:11,053
It's your decision.

723
01:16:11,055 --> 01:16:12,891
It's your finger
that's pulling this trigger.

724
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:21,399
- I'm sorry.
- No.

725
01:16:23,534 --> 01:16:26,670
I haven't come all this way
to see you die.

726
01:16:32,844 --> 01:16:34,313
I'll do it.

727
01:16:39,450 --> 01:16:41,086
I'll open it.

728
01:16:45,888 --> 01:16:48,425
Finally, a Croft
with some sense.

729
01:18:24,722 --> 01:18:26,257
Ladies first.

730
01:18:53,218 --> 01:18:55,086
Mark the path.

731
01:19:27,218 --> 01:19:29,319
She's still breathing.

732
01:19:29,321 --> 01:19:31,954
Or it's a change in
atmospheric pressure.

733
01:19:31,956 --> 01:19:33,424
Keep walking.

734
01:19:50,108 --> 01:19:51,742
You should've seen
the look on your...

735
01:20:05,589 --> 01:20:08,127
That wasn't designed
to keep people out.

736
01:20:10,129 --> 01:20:12,160
That was put there
to keep people in.

737
01:20:12,162 --> 01:20:13,397
Dad?

738
01:20:47,230 --> 01:20:49,300
Chasm of Souls.

739
01:21:45,189 --> 01:21:46,824
You go next.

740
01:22:00,504 --> 01:22:04,608
"Pray to survive
the faces of Himiko."

741
01:22:05,108 --> 01:22:06,509
We're getting closer.

742
01:22:10,747 --> 01:22:15,250
"The Death Queen
turns day to night.

743
01:22:15,252 --> 01:22:18,455
"She must die
to bring back life."

744
01:22:24,062 --> 01:22:25,429
Oh, shit.

745
01:22:37,407 --> 01:22:38,675
- The floor!
- Lara!

746
01:22:48,451 --> 01:22:50,454
There's gotta be a way
to stop this.

747
01:22:51,956 --> 01:22:53,456
Look around!

748
01:22:55,393 --> 01:22:57,592
Come on. Come on!

749
01:22:57,594 --> 01:22:59,797
Vogel, what's going on?

750
01:23:13,912 --> 01:23:15,277
"Pray to survive."

751
01:23:15,279 --> 01:23:18,082
It's a keyhole. We need a key!

752
01:23:19,283 --> 01:23:20,750
The prayer wheels!

753
01:23:25,689 --> 01:23:26,723
Lara!

754
01:23:31,395 --> 01:23:32,761
It's not working.

755
01:23:32,763 --> 01:23:34,432
Check the other prayer wheels.

756
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,467
Try this!

757
01:23:40,803 --> 01:23:42,139
No.

758
01:23:42,306 --> 01:23:43,540
Wait.

759
01:23:47,045 --> 01:23:48,046
It's a color puzzle.

760
01:23:51,049 --> 01:23:54,316
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."

761
01:23:54,318 --> 01:23:56,753
- Black.
- Black! Here!

762
01:23:58,422 --> 01:23:59,488
Shit!

763
01:23:59,490 --> 01:24:00,724
Blue!

764
01:24:02,326 --> 01:24:03,458
No!

765
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:04,729
Here!

766
01:24:06,096 --> 01:24:07,497
It doesn't work.

767
01:24:09,134 --> 01:24:10,135
Lara!

768
01:24:17,341 --> 01:24:19,610
Last one! Yellow!

769
01:24:26,549 --> 01:24:28,317
It's not working.

770
01:24:28,319 --> 01:24:30,519
Just try them all, damn it!

771
01:24:30,521 --> 01:24:33,454
"The Death Queen
turns the day to night."

772
01:24:33,456 --> 01:24:35,290
"She must die
to bring back..."

773
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:36,557
"Life."

774
01:24:36,559 --> 01:24:37,929
Come on!

775
01:24:39,729 --> 01:24:41,598
The color of life.

776
01:24:47,437 --> 01:24:49,107
I'm running out of floor!

777
01:24:56,281 --> 01:24:57,615
Green!

778
01:25:20,670 --> 01:25:23,437
You always were the brains
of the family, sprout.

779
01:25:27,245 --> 01:25:29,546
Well, let's get going, sprout.

780
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:36,922
Where's the floor?

781
01:25:38,055 --> 01:25:39,056
Gone.

782
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:54,472
Flare.

783
01:26:10,653 --> 01:26:12,522
Come on, Lara.

784
01:26:14,892 --> 01:26:16,127
I'm going back for her.

785
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:19,328
I'm coming with you.

786
01:26:19,330 --> 01:26:21,166
You dad gave his life for us.

787
01:26:59,069 --> 01:27:04,308
Himiko's army of
a thousand handmaidens.

788
01:27:05,242 --> 01:27:08,575
They sacrificed themselves
in ritual suicide

789
01:27:08,577 --> 01:27:10,880
to serve their queen
in the afterlife.

790
01:27:16,753 --> 01:27:18,889
Exactly as your notes.

791
01:27:21,425 --> 01:27:22,626
We found her.

792
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:52,223
All right, this is it.
We're finishing this.

793
01:27:53,790 --> 01:27:55,958
It's not too late
to change your mind.

794
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,592
There's a very big difference

795
01:27:57,594 --> 01:27:59,860
between myth and reality,
Richard.

796
01:27:59,862 --> 01:28:02,833
Something that you could
never understand.

797
01:28:03,732 --> 01:28:04,935
Gentlemen.

798
01:28:23,220 --> 01:28:24,655
Open it.

799
01:29:08,965 --> 01:29:12,601
You see? I told you there was
nothing to be afraid of.

800
01:29:12,603 --> 01:29:14,435
It's just...

801
01:29:14,437 --> 01:29:16,241
...a little old lady.

802
01:29:19,143 --> 01:29:21,011
Prepare her for transport.

803
01:29:29,585 --> 01:29:31,422
Something doesn't add up.

804
01:29:32,455 --> 01:29:35,826
She's not a monster
in any of these paintings.

805
01:29:41,398 --> 01:29:44,434
It looks like she was
taking herself here.

806
01:29:48,238 --> 01:29:49,872
Not being forced.

807
01:29:52,109 --> 01:29:55,443
<i>The Death Queen
turns day to night.</i>

808
01:29:55,445 --> 01:29:57,846
<i>She must die
to bring back life.</i>

809
01:29:57,848 --> 01:29:59,417
"Bring back life."

810
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,785
<i>Spreading
death and destruction</i>

811
01:30:04,787 --> 01:30:06,027
<i>with just the touch
of her hand.</i>

812
01:30:07,790 --> 01:30:08,992
Go on.

813
01:30:11,461 --> 01:30:13,461
All myths have
foundation in reality.

814
01:30:13,463 --> 01:30:15,164
...in reality.

815
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:17,235
Sacrificing one life
is worth saving millions.

816
01:30:18,701 --> 01:30:19,970
Wait!

817
01:30:21,871 --> 01:30:24,474
She was sacrificing herself.

818
01:30:26,776 --> 01:30:28,913
She was protecting the world.

819
01:30:44,095 --> 01:30:45,627
See?

820
01:30:45,629 --> 01:30:47,364
Smoke and mirrors.

821
01:30:49,732 --> 01:30:51,834
All right, let's bag her up.
Come on.

822
01:31:11,956 --> 01:31:13,925
They thought it was magic.

823
01:31:20,130 --> 01:31:22,065
She was a carrier.

824
01:31:23,566 --> 01:31:24,867
She was immune.

825
01:31:32,343 --> 01:31:33,844
It's a disease.

826
01:32:26,495 --> 01:32:29,831
This is what Trinity wants.
This gets me home.

827
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:34,138
If you take this out
into the world, it's genocide.

828
01:32:40,176 --> 01:32:44,181
I just need to take
a very small piece of you.

829
01:33:39,602 --> 01:33:41,973
Go! Get her! Get her!

830
01:34:02,558 --> 01:34:04,927
Well, this is it, Richard.

831
01:34:04,929 --> 01:34:07,195
All we have to do
is walk out of here.

832
01:34:07,197 --> 01:34:08,598
You're not going anywhere.

833
01:34:20,543 --> 01:34:22,246
Come on, Richard.

834
01:34:24,813 --> 01:34:26,349
Think of your daughter.

835
01:34:35,024 --> 01:34:36,459
Come on.

836
01:34:37,727 --> 01:34:39,063
Come on.

837
01:36:32,943 --> 01:36:35,011
- Dad.
- Lara.

838
01:36:35,245 --> 01:36:37,012
Vogel's gone.

839
01:36:37,014 --> 01:36:39,981
- You need to go after him.
- Come on, let's go.

840
01:36:39,983 --> 01:36:42,752
- No, stay back. Stay back.
- What are you talking...

841
01:36:45,687 --> 01:36:47,190
I'm done for.

842
01:36:53,130 --> 01:36:54,464
I'm infected.

843
01:36:56,866 --> 01:36:58,136
No.

844
01:37:01,404 --> 01:37:04,574
You can't touch me.
Don't touch.

845
01:37:05,607 --> 01:37:09,110
You must stop Vogel
and get the hell out of here.

846
01:37:09,112 --> 01:37:11,514
And I'll bury Himiko
once and for all.

847
01:37:13,183 --> 01:37:14,847
I've only just found you.

848
01:37:14,849 --> 01:37:17,352
Promise me you'll stop him.
Promise me!

849
01:37:17,354 --> 01:37:18,987
There must be another way.

850
01:37:18,989 --> 01:37:20,721
Lara.

851
01:37:20,723 --> 01:37:23,493
You're a very, very
bright young woman.

852
01:37:24,860 --> 01:37:26,463
There's no other way.

853
01:37:33,938 --> 01:37:36,172
I need you.

854
01:37:36,174 --> 01:37:39,776
No, you don't.
You're worth 10 of me.

855
01:37:42,179 --> 01:37:44,378
You said you don't
believe in magic.

856
01:37:44,380 --> 01:37:46,916
Well, what's this, my darling?

857
01:37:47,283 --> 01:37:49,550
All this time here...

858
01:37:49,552 --> 01:37:52,286
I wished I could
see you grow up.

859
01:37:52,288 --> 01:37:53,886
No.

860
01:37:53,888 --> 01:37:55,557
And now I have.

861
01:37:55,959 --> 01:37:57,860
It's a miracle.

862
01:37:58,261 --> 01:38:00,361
Chin up, sprout.

863
01:38:00,363 --> 01:38:02,200
There's jobs to do.

864
01:38:04,733 --> 01:38:06,269
Go on, go!

865
01:38:07,536 --> 01:38:09,802
There's no time, Lara.

866
01:38:09,804 --> 01:38:10,807
Go on, go!

867
01:38:26,455 --> 01:38:28,225
Dad loves you.

868
01:38:32,428 --> 01:38:33,997
I love you.

869
01:39:28,785 --> 01:39:31,119
Oh, you really wanna
do this, little girl?

870
01:39:31,121 --> 01:39:32,656
Let's just go home.

871
01:39:46,403 --> 01:39:49,036
You're not savin' anyone.

872
01:39:49,038 --> 01:39:50,371
Trinity is everywhere.

873
01:39:53,277 --> 01:39:54,477
Yeah?

874
01:40:34,050 --> 01:40:35,617
I made a promise.

875
01:40:40,090 --> 01:40:42,855
No. No. No!

876
01:40:42,857 --> 01:40:44,893
You're not
getting out of here.

877
01:40:45,162 --> 01:40:46,663
No! No!

878
01:41:46,687 --> 01:41:48,057
When you see Richard,

879
01:41:49,393 --> 01:41:51,194
send him my regards.

880
01:42:32,601 --> 01:42:33,836
Send them yourself.

881
01:42:51,121 --> 01:42:53,622
You messed
with the wrong family.

882
01:44:52,175 --> 01:44:53,709
Lara!

883
01:45:00,250 --> 01:45:01,385
Lara!

884
01:45:10,260 --> 01:45:11,691
Lara?

885
01:45:53,403 --> 01:45:55,038
Well...

886
01:45:55,437 --> 01:45:56,940
We're not dead yet.

887
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:03,013
No shit.

888
01:46:27,635 --> 01:46:31,708
Vogel, Vogel, this is
Patna Transport Bravo 5. Over.

889
01:46:34,811 --> 01:46:37,413
Vogel, Vogel,
are you reading me? Over.

890
01:46:38,714 --> 01:46:39,950
Boss.

891
01:46:43,920 --> 01:46:45,988
You're takin' us home, yeah?

892
01:47:24,626 --> 01:47:27,694
Officially gone. Like magic.

893
01:47:27,696 --> 01:47:29,695
I don't think he has gone.

894
01:47:31,433 --> 01:47:34,537
- I see so much of him in you.
- Thanks, Ana.

895
01:47:34,736 --> 01:47:36,405
Really.

896
01:47:37,073 --> 01:47:39,308
You're in charge now, Lara.

897
01:47:40,911 --> 01:47:43,810
This is a list
of all our assets.

898
01:47:43,812 --> 01:47:45,678
Thank you.

899
01:47:45,680 --> 01:47:47,847
No, I think you'd better stay

900
01:47:47,849 --> 01:47:49,650
on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.

901
01:47:49,652 --> 01:47:52,052
Well, as you wish.

902
01:47:52,054 --> 01:47:54,054
Boardrooms and business deals.

903
01:47:54,056 --> 01:47:56,556
I'm just not
that kind of Croft.

904
01:48:03,764 --> 01:48:07,370
Neither was Dad,
as it turns out.

905
01:48:22,085 --> 01:48:24,953
Are all these companies
owned by us?

906
01:48:25,220 --> 01:48:26,355
Yes.

907
01:49:07,562 --> 01:49:09,796
<i>I know them
by name now...</i>

908
01:49:09,798 --> 01:49:12,035
<i>The Order of Trinity.</i>

909
01:49:13,970 --> 01:49:15,802
<i>An ancient
militant organization</i>

910
01:49:15,804 --> 01:49:18,306
<i>that seeks control
over the supernatural</i>

911
01:49:18,308 --> 01:49:21,178
<i>in order to rule
the fate of mankind.</i>

912
01:49:24,647 --> 01:49:27,815
<i>What kind of work
do you do?</i>

913
01:49:27,817 --> 01:49:32,219
<i>Oh, a mix of things.
At the mercy of my employer.</i>

914
01:49:32,221 --> 01:49:34,992
<i>Are all these companies
owned by us?</i>

915
01:49:37,292 --> 01:49:39,394
<i>You're not
savin' anyone.</i>

916
01:49:40,028 --> 01:49:43,164
<i>Trinity is everywhere.</i>

917
01:49:43,166 --> 01:49:45,199
<i>I know it's difficult
to accept.</i>

918
01:49:45,201 --> 01:49:48,238
But you really must come in
and sign those papers now.

919
01:49:49,171 --> 01:49:51,137
<i>I think
you'd better stay</i>

920
01:49:51,139 --> 01:49:52,708
<i>on top of
the day-to-day things, Ana.</i>

921
01:49:53,041 --> 01:49:54,909
<i>As you wish.</i>

922
01:49:54,911 --> 01:49:57,012
<i>The only person
that I get to talk to</i>

923
01:49:57,014 --> 01:49:59,416
<i>is on the other end
of this phone.</i>

924
01:50:09,392 --> 01:50:11,325
<i>You must understand.</i>

925
01:50:11,327 --> 01:50:14,164
<i>We Crofts,
we have responsibilities.</i>

926
01:50:16,631 --> 01:50:18,100
Jobs to do.

927
01:50:27,977 --> 01:50:30,478
Oh. You again.

928
01:50:33,116 --> 01:50:35,048
I came back for the amulet.

929
01:50:35,050 --> 01:50:37,384
Shame. I was hoping
you'd forgotten.

930
01:50:37,386 --> 01:50:39,186
It's worth a bloody fortune.

931
01:50:39,188 --> 01:50:41,488
I did tell you
it was your lucky day.

932
01:50:41,490 --> 01:50:42,822
Yes, you did.

933
01:50:44,660 --> 01:50:47,364
- At it again, are we, Alan?
- I'm not at it.

934
01:50:54,237 --> 01:50:56,435
I don't know
if you've noticed or not,

935
01:50:56,437 --> 01:50:58,271
but, uh, you can't be
too careful these days

936
01:50:58,273 --> 01:51:00,408
because the world
has gone bloody mad.

937
01:51:00,410 --> 01:51:02,874
Yes, yes, thank you, Alan.

938
01:51:02,876 --> 01:51:07,280
What you got there is
a HK USP 9 mil. extended mag.

939
01:51:07,282 --> 01:51:09,218
It's my personal favorite.

940
01:51:12,154 --> 01:51:13,954
You like that?

941
01:51:13,956 --> 01:51:15,056
I do.

942
01:51:15,058 --> 01:51:16,259
Mmm.

943
01:51:18,161 --> 01:51:19,729
I'll take two.
