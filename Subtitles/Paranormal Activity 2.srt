1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:19,102
Welcome home, Hunter.
This is your house.

3
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:22,939
Gonna look out of that window.
There's your front door.

4
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:25,191
Hi, Dad.

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,318
How are you?

6
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,112
- Happy.
- Hi, little man.

7
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,405
We got to keep him out
of the sun, too, OK?

8
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,532
Yeah. How are you feeling?

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,951
Guess who changed
the first, like, 1 5 diapers?

10
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:36,411
- This guy, right here.
- Wait, wait.

11
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:38,621
Guess who was in labour for a day?

12
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:39,872
- This girl.
- I've been in labour for...

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,290
- Hi.
- That's your mama.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:44,335
Hi. Hunter, this is Martine,
your new nanny.

15
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,170
She will probably
fix your dirty diapers

16
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:47,296
- because I won't.
- Can I see?

17
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:48,798
Yes.

18
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,800
Oh, my goodness. Look at this.

19
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,427
- He's cute, right?
- Isn't he adorable?

20
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:55,847
He's kind of smooshy looking.
I'm not gonna lie.

21
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,557
He's just newborn,
he's a newborn...

22
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,351
Seriously, the cutest baby ever,
next to me. Second to me.

23
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:02,311
Just touch him and
cuddle him all day long.

24
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,230
You see how tiny he is?

25
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,692
Do you mind if I take him?
Not if he's sleeping,

26
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,819
but I want to take him
on a tour of the house.

27
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,238
OK. He's not sleeping.

28
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:15,283
That's Abby.
Gonna be your best friend.

29
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:17,326
Bye, sweetie.

30
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:21,080
This is a fireplace.
This is how Mommy seduced Daddy...

31
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:23,916
- Oh.
- ...and that's how we got you.

32
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,294
And that's why you're watching
this video at 25.

33
00:01:26,462 --> 00:01:27,920
This is your room.

34
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,091
There's your crib.
It's a little sparse right now.

35
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:33,551
Just got some
caterpillar action going on.

36
00:01:33,719 --> 00:01:36,804
"Hunter." See? Pretty cool.

37
00:01:36,972 --> 00:01:39,265
This is your sister's trashed room.

38
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,601
- No, I'll check with him.
- Oh, there she is.

39
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,895
Wassup, brother
from another mother?

40
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,605
- What?
- No, Hunter's in...

41
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,609
You're never allowed to come in
here, ever. Unless I invite you.

42
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,235
In which case, it's gonna be
the best day of your life.

43
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:53,529
By the way, that's my bathroom.
Don't ever go in there.

44
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,866
That's half your bathroom. It's actually
my bathroom, 'cause I bought it.

45
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,202
All that is mine.
Don't pee on my seat!

46
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,205
This is the living room
that no one ever uses.

47
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,582
Hey, somebody left
the front door open!

48
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,212
Nice.
Don't do that, OK?

49
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:13,007
This is my first man cave.
That's where all my genius ideas come.

50
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,550
This is the second man cave,

51
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,803
where we're gonna watch
Chargers games together.

52
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,597
This is my 50-inch monster.

53
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:21,307
Look at that. It's beautiful.

54
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,271
I don't even know
if I swaddled him right.

55
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,649
It's just... Yeah.

56
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:35,446
Hi, baby boy. Hi.

57
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,781
Hi.

58
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,786
- He smells good.
- Yes.

59
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:45,373
You're just like Daddy.

60
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,501
You make poops all the time.

61
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,258
- Is that good?
- Sí.

62
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,843
OK.

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,722
Is a special baby. Sí?

64
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,019
- Thank you.
- That is so cute.

65
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,521
I'll get it!

66
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:15,862
- Hey! Let me see this baby.
- Hi!

67
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,113
- Aunt Katie!
- Where is he?

68
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,739
He's upstairs.

69
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,993
Hi.

70
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:27,748
Hi. Hi.

71
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:30,960
You are so precious.

72
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,880
Hi.

73
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:38,092
I already love you so much.

74
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,136
- My sister did good.
- Yeah.

75
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:41,804
You probably had a little
part in it, I don't know.

76
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:43,431
- Very little.
- Hi.

77
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:47,977
It's her boyfriend.
Yeah, he's a big boy, just like his...

78
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:50,313
Kinda just eating cookies.

79
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,481
Hello, baby.

80
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,525
- Dad, my burger?
- Or whatever.

81
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,277
- Right, sorry.
- Gimme another plate.

82
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:03,242
- Nice.
- Did you get that?

83
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,828
- I want you to meet my Aunt Katie.
- Wait.

84
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,079
Does it stay on?

85
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,165
It does stay on,
but I didn't want to get it wet.

86
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:12,043
Oh, no, of course not.
That would be ridiculous.

87
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,794
- That would ruin it.
- That is so...

88
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,172
- Swear to God, I will kill you.
- Look at that, perfect.

89
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:17,673
Perfect handoff right there.

90
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:21,177
She's my only niece. Not really,
but I think of her as my niece.

91
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,470
She's my step-niece.

92
00:04:22,638 --> 00:04:26,015
- I'm the evil step-aunt.
- Step?

93
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:28,267
The evil step-aunt? I'm not sure
how to take that. I'm not sure...

94
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,645
Well, I'm not really evil,
but I can be evil is my point.

95
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,105
Dad, the face came off!

96
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,321
- There can be only one!
- I will not let you go.

97
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:42,823
I can't believe he's over a year old.

98
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,076
Where's Micah?

99
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,827
Oh, he...

100
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,039
He wasn't up for hanging out today.

101
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,834
I can't find the tape.

102
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,836
That's fine, I'm just
gonna tape over an old one.

103
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,089
Can you get Abby out of here, please?
She's gonna get cut on the glass!

104
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,883
We just got back and the whole
place has been just destroyed.

105
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,594
Nothing seems to be missing.
It's just, everything's really...

106
00:05:03,762 --> 00:05:05,096
But that's what she's telling me.

107
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,431
Make sure we document everything.
Don't touch anything.

108
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:10,559
This is our foyer.
The furniture's damaged.

109
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,520
My daughter Ali's room.

110
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,192
It just feels... gross
that somebody was in here.

111
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,777
Master bedroom.

112
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,614
Yeah, so that's great.

113
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,450
- Your watches are still there?
- Yeah.

114
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,077
Diamonds are here.

115
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,832
The only thing missing is
the necklace my sister made me.

116
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,292
Oh, sweetie.

117
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,294
This is horrible. It's fucking horrible.

118
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:40,381
It's the nursery.

119
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,968
As far as I know,
this room was not touched.

120
00:05:48,974 --> 00:05:50,516
This is our basement.

121
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:54,812
I don't see anything really broken.
I don't know if there's anything...

122
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,982
I don't think they did anything
down here. I... What is that?

123
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,819
Is that Abby?
It really stinks, though.

124
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,071
- Oh.
- Well, clothes are still here.

125
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,742
Your bikes are still here.
Not that you're using those.

126
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,118
And your bike is over here, so...

127
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,246
And the epic clean continues.

128
00:06:12,414 --> 00:06:13,664
This looks like we had a party.

129
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:16,333
Right?

130
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,502
Worst party ever.

131
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,965
I don't know, kiddo.
This is messed up.

132
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,135
What are you talking about?
They didn't take anything. We're fine.

133
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,595
You're fine.

134
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,851
So this is it.
Like I said, about a week ago,

135
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,353
- the place was completely trashed.
- Hello.

136
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,980
- Hello.
- That's our daughter, Ali.

137
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:42,026
Pretty much every room in the house.
We had both doors locked.

138
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:43,694
Put one up here, up in the corner,

139
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:46,864
and then you get the whole stairway,
the front door, this whole hallway.

140
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:50,284
One over there, facing this way,
you'd get this door and this door.

141
00:06:50,452 --> 00:06:52,703
Or have one in here, getting
all these windows, the sliding...

142
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:54,371
They run, like, all the time?

143
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:57,792
Yeah, they're always recording.
You can't get away with anything.

144
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:00,795
That stuff.

145
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,713
Corner up there, so you get
who's coming in and out

146
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,507
- of this door, that door.
- Bathroom.

147
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,884
And you get to see
the baby at night, too.

148
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,677
You're not putting one
in my bathroom, right?

149
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,221
- Yeah. What?
- Wait.

150
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,473
Put a camera that sees in complete dark.
It'd be perfect.

151
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:14,517
- Yeah, really?
- Yeah, oh, yeah.

152
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,311
- Yeah, OK, that'd be sweet.
- They'll look like motion detectors.

153
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:19,480
Little tiny hole.
I have one I could show you.

154
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,649
- Can you put one in that bunny?
- Very cool.

155
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:24,568
And then we can,
I can set you up with the...

156
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:27,738
Yeah, so, I'm gonna close
it up there like that.

157
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,281
It's hidden.
Can't even tell it's a camera.

158
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,908
How many are we getting?

159
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,578
I don't know. But what'd you...?
What, is that... six?

160
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:39,416
- I don't know.
- One, two, three...

161
00:09:12,844 --> 00:09:14,929
What are you doing
out here, little buddy?

162
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:32,363
Yeah. Go get it.

163
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,325
You're super fast, big man.

164
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,577
What's Martine doing?

165
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,371
What is she doing?

166
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,084
He's good, right?

167
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:51,882
You're a good puppy.
What you say, Abby?

168
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:55,219
Hey, Hunter. Hunter,
you want another fishy?

169
00:09:55,387 --> 00:09:59,848
What are you doing?
What you doing?

170
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,523
Oh, buddy, I think it's time for N-A-P.
What do you think?

171
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,192
Yeah?

172
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:13,404
Come on. Come here, buddy,
let's move this first.

173
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,865
OK. Aw, that's a good baby.
That's a good baby. OK.

174
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:19,702
Oh! You gotta help me
out here, buddy.

175
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,371
Thank you.
That's a good boy.

176
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:29,545
OK.

177
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,883
I know. Everything's fine,
you're just superbaby.

178
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:40,723
Did you do this all by yourself? Man,
Daddy's gonna be so proud.

179
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:44,101
OK, I'll just clean up the rest
of it when I bring you back.

180
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,275
What's up, Martine?

181
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:56,113
Wassup? What's up, Ali?

182
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:59,074
What were you doing?
What were you doing earlier?

183
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,578
When you were, like,
talking to yourself?

184
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:05,497
All crazy like.
Are you going crazy here, too?

185
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,625
- No... crazy.
- You're just getting it from all of us.

186
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,254
The house is...
There are bad things in the house?

187
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,422
No.

188
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,384
- You're getting rid of spirits. OK.
- Uh-huh.

189
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:18,594
All right.

190
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:21,680
The good ones...

191
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,684
- We keep the good ones.
- Yes.

192
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,811
In with the good, out with the bad.

193
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,191
In with the paella, out with the...

194
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,234
Holy crap, that's a lot of garlic.

195
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:41,533
One, two, three.

196
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,995
Oh, I almost got him.

197
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:46,580
One, two...

198
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,836
Oh, my God!
Look at what Martine left!

199
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:55,923
- Oh!
- Disgusting! I wanna throw up! It...

200
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:58,008
She put it in the freaking...

201
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,053
- No, you! That was you!
- It's not me!

202
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,638
- Don't blame somebody else!
- Hand to God!

203
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,057
God, there was like a live
crawdaddy in there.

204
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,392
- She clogged it. I can't look.
- That is a stench-ilada.

205
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,229
- That is horrible. You're grounded.
- I'm not capable of...

206
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,730
You are grounded. Awful.

207
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:14,233
This is the best bath...

208
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,069
- It looks pretty good.
- ...I've... I think it...

209
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:19,822
Well, if you come in,
it'll be the best bath I've ever...

210
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:24,535
It's so quiet and, like, there's
nobody here. It's fantastic.

211
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,163
I love Martine, but I'm kind of loving
the fact that she's not here.

212
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:30,749
- Yeah.
- What time is your sister coming?

213
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:34,503
What time is it now?

214
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,172
7.20. Something like that.

215
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,883
Oh, like an hour or so.

216
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:42,594
You should definitely pop in.

217
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,430
I don't want to smash you,
but I kind of want to get in.

218
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,599
You don't want to smash me?
I kinda want you to smash me.

219
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,935
- Really? Oh.
- Yeah.

220
00:12:50,103 --> 00:12:51,895
Let me release the Kraken.

221
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,645
Hey.

222
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:37,649
You're OK.

223
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,323
I gotcha.

224
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,326
You're OK. You're OK.

225
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:49,745
Look, it's perfect, right?

226
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:52,497
- That's a lot of grease in there.
- I'm gonna drain it.

227
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,000
Here, goofy mug.

228
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,127
Do you need anything?

229
00:13:57,295 --> 00:14:00,297
- Hey!
- Are you making breakfast?

230
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:03,175
- Thank you so much.
- How you doing?

231
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,927
- I was, but, uh...
- Hola.

232
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,054
- Did he keep you up?
- Yeah, yeah.

233
00:14:07,222 --> 00:14:08,639
- He definitely kept me up.
- Yeah, he does that.

234
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,015
I love you so much.

235
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,809
- I love you so much.
- Thank you so much.

236
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,853
- I love you so much.
- That's OK. Aw.

237
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:17,481
You're amazing. I don't think
I'm really awake yet, though.

238
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,649
There's coffee.

239
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:21,860
I love my sister
She's the best

240
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,238
Remember that time
you tried to be a vegan

241
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,658
- for like six hours?
- A day and a half?

242
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,368
- That was a difficult time.
- It was for one meal.

243
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,536
- Making bacon?
- Yeah.

244
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,705
- Good morning.
- Yo, yo, yo, what up?

245
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,541
Thank you for loaning out
your beautiful girlfriend for the night.

246
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,378
- What up?
- She made my day.

247
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:41,505
Tell me that's not yours.

248
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,507
It's not really mine, no.

249
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:44,800
Thanks for not watching
the sausage for us, Ali.

250
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:45,968
I did watch it!

251
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,469
It's mine and hers.
She uses it most.

252
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,513
Cool. It's HD.
Do I get some love, too?

253
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:52,808
What?

254
00:14:52,976 --> 00:14:54,893
You scared little Hunter.

255
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,022
How's it going?
Can I get you some coffee?

256
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:01,441
- Dude, I have a bone to pick with you.
- Yeah?

257
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,278
I went into Burger King,
and I was like, hey, man.

258
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:07,197
I tossed your name around and they
didn't give me any free food, dude.

259
00:15:07,365 --> 00:15:09,491
I don't own, like, every Burger King.

260
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,079
He's not actually
the king of Burger King.

261
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:15,247
I'm not?

262
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm still in the process of easing him
in to the fact that we live together

263
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,002
and, therefore, the house should
represent the both of us.

264
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:23,255
Well, yeah, but the both
of us, like, a give and take.

265
00:15:23,423 --> 00:15:25,257
Like you have your beading
thing or whatever it is,

266
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:27,175
and then I have my area, you know?

267
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,386
- The whole rest of the house?
- Of manliness.

268
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,472
I'm telling you, that baby's gonna be
a rock star when he grows up.

269
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,768
Yeah, get it. Whoa!
Dad, careful, are you watching that?

270
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,021
There was no sign
of forced entry, but...

271
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:42,274
They trashed our whole house.
I mean, I think it was more vandalism.

272
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,526
See that thing in the corner?
Looks like a motion detector?

273
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,321
- Are you, like...?
- That's a camera.

274
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,698
We're watching you!

275
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,452
You like little wheels that roll.

276
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:58,290
You're such a ham.
Such a ham. Are you leaving?

277
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,460
Things have gotten a little difficult
since he learned how to open the door.

278
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:06,131
So are you freaked
out after the break in?

279
00:16:06,299 --> 00:16:10,218
Yeah, I mean, I definitely was.
I don't think I was sleeping very well.

280
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,471
Oh, sweetie? Sweetie.

281
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,806
I would be freaked out,
too, if, you know,

282
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,308
somebody had broken into my house.

283
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:19,102
Well, it's just, they
didn't take anything. You know?

284
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,812
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

285
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,359
It seemed personal.
It feels like they're always still here.

286
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,402
You know? I don't know, I...

287
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,614
I get this feeling,
like when we were little.

288
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,115
What?

289
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,327
Never mind.

290
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,498
Mac and cheese,
mac and cheese.

291
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,334
Hey, Kris? I'm gonna go out.
I'm not gonna be in.

292
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,211
- Oh, OK. Where are you going?
- Just the mall.

293
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,545
All right, well, have fun.

294
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:48,590
- Bye!
- Bye!

295
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:51,593
Mac and cheese.
Mac and cheese.

296
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,470
No?

297
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,083
Hey, what's up there?

298
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,170
Let's look at baby Hunter.

299
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:17,382
Boy, that one was bad.
That's that bee bonnet that the...

300
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,760
He's like, that was totally humiliating.
Nobody needs to see this.

301
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,387
- Oh, this is crazy.
- What?

302
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:24,723
- Who do you think that is?
- Is that you?

303
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,350
No, that's your Aunt Katie.
That's...

304
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,893
- That's Katie?
- That's so weird.

305
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,563
I thought we lost all
our pictures in the fire.

306
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:40,280
That's great.

307
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,403
Yo, Martine?

308
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,407
Kristi and Dad are out
tonight. I'm going out tonight.

309
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,951
You gonna have your
boyfriend over? Have a party?

310
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,497
- Este Brad. Novio.
- Yeah.

311
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:13,748
He, he boy.

312
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:16,960
...want handsy, handsy,
touchy. No.

313
00:22:17,128 --> 00:22:18,169
"No."

314
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,422
- The handsy, handsy, touchy?
- The handsy-handsy, sí.

315
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:23,007
Is that the kind of dance you
were showing me, the Handsy?

316
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,218
Shake it.

317
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,520
I thought I was gonna have
to give him the Heimlich.

318
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,314
Hey, what are you doing?

319
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,150
That's enough, Martine.
Put it down.

320
00:25:27,318 --> 00:25:28,526
Martine, he's fine.

321
00:25:28,694 --> 00:25:30,528
I've asked you
not to do this, OK?

322
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:31,863
It is not good for the baby.

323
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,365
Please,
put it out right now.

324
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,701
No más, no más.
That's enough.

325
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:39,329
Put it out right now, please.

326
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,456
OK, that's enough.

327
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,543
What are you doing?

328
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:48,212
- The baby is fine, OK?
- No, no.

329
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,798
The baby should not be breathing that.
Nobody should.

330
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:54,594
No, I don't...
Just stop doing it, please.

331
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:57,847
Goddamn it.

332
00:26:04,355 --> 00:26:05,605
God.

333
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:10,401
OK, that's like two months.
All right?

334
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,953
- OK? I told you.
- Sí.

335
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:29,921
I do understand, OK? I just,
I don't believe in that stuff,

336
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,132
OK? It's just... I cannot have that
stuff in my house. OK?

337
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,760
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

338
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:39,681
Can I give you a great
recommendation, OK?

339
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:40,932
You were very good for us.

340
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,943
Da-da.

341
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,203
Come on, make Daddy proud.
Say, "Da-da."

342
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,833
Hunter, look over here.

343
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:08,751
Hunter?

344
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:11,796
You are so like your dad.

345
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,844
Sweetie. Sweetie?

346
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,555
Come on, come on.

347
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,392
What are you looking at?

348
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,146
Look at Mama.

349
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,734
Buddy? What? What? Oh.

350
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:35,069
Look over here.

351
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:37,321
There's nothing there, goofball.

352
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,158
Where are you going?
Hunter?

353
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,124
I can't see you back there.

354
00:27:48,292 --> 00:27:50,460
We were up in the nursery,
playing, and I was trying

355
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:53,629
to get him to say "Da-da" again,
and he just wouldn't focus.

356
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,507
He was looking at the ceiling and
mirror, everywhere but me.

357
00:27:56,675 --> 00:28:00,386
Well, he's a baby. He's got an attention
span of a guppy. You know?

358
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,972
I guess, but there was definitely
something he was focused

359
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:05,141
on, and it wasn't
my pretty face.

360
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,937
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

361
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:12,064
- What's going on?
- Nothing much.

362
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:14,025
Check this out.

363
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,486
- Dad, can you please not do that?
- Yeah, night vision.

364
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:19,030
Cool, I'm gonna get nail polish
on the bed. Please?

365
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:20,531
You got freaky eyes.
You look like a possum.

366
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,699
Dad.

367
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,285
- There we go.
- Painting my nails, Dad.

368
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,537
Why are you in here?
What do you want?

369
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:29,123
- Sorry, crabby.
- I'm not crabby.

370
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:31,417
You're Crabby McRumpelstein.

371
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,921
- Why did I fire Martine?
- Yeah.

372
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,714
Because I didn't like her
doing all that weird

373
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:39,550
- witchy stuff around Hunter.
- It wasn't witchy.

374
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,970
It wasn't witchy...
It wasn't hurting anybody.

375
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,515
It made her feel better,
and she wanted to make us feel better.

376
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,226
She was, like, slaughtering goats
out by the pool, OK?

377
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,936
- No, she wasn't.
- All right.

378
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:54,190
Good luck and it's... Stay in the lines.

379
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,900
- What? Dad!
- Check it.

380
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,902
- On! Stop!
- Off.

381
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,571
Let me get one more. Oh!

382
00:29:48,287 --> 00:29:50,121
Come here.

383
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:51,706
Come here, come on.

384
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:54,792
It's OK.
It's OK, buddy. It's OK.

385
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,318
No.

386
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,778
It's OK, buddy,
there's nothing there.

387
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,741
Is that what
woke you up, buddy?

388
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,558
Daniel!

389
00:31:36,395 --> 00:31:37,603
Daniel?

390
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:41,941
God. Nasty.

391
00:31:42,109 --> 00:31:44,485
- Dad, don't pick it up with your hands.
- Why not?

392
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,655
Because it could, like...
They can have diseases and stuff...

393
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:49,073
- It flew into the window...
- It's so sad.

394
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,199
I don't even want to look at it.

395
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:52,243
- What?
- Its neck is all broken.

396
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,161
Oh, my God,
just put it in the thing!

397
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,038
- I'm trying to...
- Why did you pick it up with tong...?

398
00:31:56,206 --> 00:31:57,832
- I don't know.
- What do you think?

399
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,625
- Stop!
- Medium, medium rare?

400
00:31:59,793 --> 00:32:02,003
- You're really mean.
- It's just a dead bird.

401
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,088
- Oh.
- It was a live bird. And then it...

402
00:32:04,256 --> 00:32:06,173
- It's really sad.
- OK.

403
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,593
You like the ball? You like ball?

404
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:13,097
Ball, ball, hit it. Smack it!

405
00:32:13,265 --> 00:32:16,517
What's in there? Get in.
What's in there?

406
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:19,311
Oh, buddy. Buddy, buddy, buddy, buddy.

407
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,026
Hunter? Oh, shit.

408
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,739
Hunter, come here! Come here.

409
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:12,591
Fuck!

410
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,400
What are you doing
back out here? Go.

411
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,738
Your dog does
not like pool cleaners.

412
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,533
Yo, what's the deal with your dog?!

413
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,287
Honestly, we're not really sure.

414
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:46,876
Splash, splash. One, two, three.
Splash, splash, splash.

415
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,378
This is the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

416
00:34:49,546 --> 00:34:50,588
Splash, splash, splash.

417
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:55,301
I think I might definitely start to
replace my girlfriend with this camera.

418
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:57,428
- Uh-huh. See? We're scared.
- It's got more features.

419
00:34:57,596 --> 00:35:00,806
Flip the thing, film yourself.
It flips. Oh, yeah, yeah.

420
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:03,601
- Oh, shit.
- Then it shows you...

421
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,936
No. I'm definitely
getting one of these.

422
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:09,273
I'll bet you guys go
extracurricular with this.

423
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,233
Who has time for that?
We've got a baby.

424
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,444
How's Daniel Rey
and his brood doing?

425
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:17,156
Oh, apparently, we have a ghost.
Did you hear about this?

426
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,784
I did not. Please elaborate,
'cause that's a very strange thing to...

427
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,913
A couple pots fell off our pot
hanger thing in the kitchen.

428
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,998
- You definitely have a ghost.
- Straight to ghost.

429
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:27,625
That's the most logical...

430
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:32,421
She thinks everything is, like,
a ghost or a... Don't you, honey?

431
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,797
What?

432
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,133
- Think everything is a ghost?
- You don't have a ghost.

433
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,427
- Yeah, you're definitely haunted.
- No.

434
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:40,137
You and your sister are, like, freaky...

435
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:43,641
- Katie, you're into this stuff?
- You don't know this stuff?

436
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:45,893
They used to do, like, séances
and shit when they were little.

437
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,645
- No!
- Yes.

438
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,230
We didn't do séances.

439
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,315
- No.
- Who'd you talk to?

440
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:52,942
You're making a mountain
out of a molehill.

441
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,195
- Katie...
- Babe, it was really no big deal.

442
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,573
- What's no big deal?
- I probably, you know,

443
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:00,991
I just don't talk about
this stuff anymore.

444
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,243
What stuff?

445
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:04,703
They used to do séances
when they were little kids.

446
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,831
It's really not that funny. You're
laughing. It's not a big deal, babe.

447
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,416
The truth is, when we were kids,

448
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,710
we got a little freaked out,
but it's really no big deal.

449
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,921
And we're having a good day
today, so let's just...

450
00:36:14,089 --> 00:36:16,215
- We'll explore this in detail later.
- Let's focus...

451
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:18,717
What about the Lizzie Borden one?
The axe murderer one?

452
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,470
You're thinking
of every, like, childhood...

453
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,306
How, where do, how would I...
Back me up...

454
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,766
How would I know this stuff
if you didn't tell us?

455
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:28,519
What's your take
on this ghost situation?

456
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:29,687
I think it's awesome.

457
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,004
Jesus Christ!

458
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:20,714
Fuck!

459
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,717
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

460
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:25,928
There it is.

461
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:33,727
Ali!

462
00:38:35,397 --> 00:38:37,481
- I thought we said good night, Brad!
- Yeah, no. We did...

463
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:39,733
- Get the fuck out of here right now!
- I'm not even here.

464
00:38:39,901 --> 00:38:41,568
Ali, did you
leave the burner on?

465
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:43,070
No?

466
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:45,739
You almost burned the fucking house...

467
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,158
Not cool, Brad.

468
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,288
How could I put it up wrong?
It's on a hook.

469
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:56,125
- Once it goes up, it's up.
- You were probably putting

470
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:59,962
it on the edge of the top part,
instead of inside.

471
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,090
The fact that it fell a second time
probably proves

472
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:06,260
- that you put it up wrong both times.
- OK.

473
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,011
You want me to show
you how to put it up?

474
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,972
No, no, no.
Then why are you putting

475
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,015
the pool cleaner
back in every morning?

476
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,600
For the last week?

477
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,269
'Cause it's a pool cleaner, and I want
it to clean the pool.

478
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,814
- How does it get out at night?
- How does it get out?

479
00:39:18,982 --> 00:39:21,442
- Yeah.
- Is it taking the car? Is it...

480
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,235
Oh, come on, honey.
No, really.

481
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:25,779
I don't know. I assume somebody takes it
out when they go swimming.

482
00:39:25,947 --> 00:39:27,448
I don't take it out,
and you don't take it out.

483
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,575
Ali, do you take the pool
cleaner out of the pool?

484
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,868
- What?
- Do you take the pool

485
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:33,120
- cleaner out of the pool?
- No.

486
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,956
What? So it's crawling
out of the pool?

487
00:39:36,124 --> 00:39:38,459
It's crawling
out of the pool by itself?

488
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:40,752
I don't know. Let's...
You know what?

489
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,630
You wanted all the cameras.
Let's go check the DVR.

490
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:46,091
Fine, let's go check it.

491
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,135
- You serious?
- Yeah, I'm very serious.

492
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:50,053
We'll find out what else is going
around here at night.

493
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,555
- Can I tape it, though?
- Yeah.

494
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,565
- What?
- See?

495
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:03,817
That is weird.

496
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:08,197
Maybe I have it set too high
or something, I don't know.

497
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,448
No.

498
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:12,826
No, I don't, I don't think
the settings are off.

499
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,504
Maybe the settings are off.

500
00:40:24,506 --> 00:40:25,506
That's what we got it for.

501
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:28,467
It's probably trying to be proactive.
Do the little patio.

502
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:31,887
It's like one of those
vacuum cleaner things you set up.

503
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,723
Yeah, it's like a Flowbee, but with...

504
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:38,685
I don't know if the house is
haunted, but I hope it is.

505
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:41,688
- You hope it is?
- Yeah.

506
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,358
Are you kidding me?
That would be fucking awesome.

507
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:45,859
Why would you hope
that the house is haunted?

508
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:48,195
That'd be the coolest thing ever.

509
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,948
If there was somebody trying to,
like, get through to us,

510
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,909
- that would be amazing.
- No, I just...

511
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,538
Kristi is obviously not sleeping.

512
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,415
Dude.

513
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:02,209
She doesn't have any...

514
00:41:02,377 --> 00:41:06,380
Her hormones are all kooky.
She's got... paranoid mommy...

515
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:08,966
...just interpreting them
in the wrong way.

516
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,636
Like, she's seeing them as,
as harmful and dangerous.

517
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,056
And maybe we should just see them
as something trying to, like...

518
00:41:16,224 --> 00:41:18,308
Like, I think we should have a séance.

519
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,936
- We could go full out... What?
- That's a great idea.

520
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:23,814
Just freaky. I don't...
I don't believe in it.

521
00:41:23,982 --> 00:41:27,067
Why do you think that it necessarily
has to be bad, though?

522
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:28,443
That's all I'm asking.

523
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:31,071
- How would it be good?
- Like, what if it's Mom?

524
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:38,055
- Hey, guys.
- What?

525
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,057
There's something you need to see.

526
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,267
- What are you talking about?
- What's going on?

527
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:43,977
- You're freaking me out.
- You have to see...

528
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:46,146
Honey, what are
you talking about?

529
00:42:50,652 --> 00:42:54,321
What are... you talking about?
What is it?

530
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:56,865
- I don't see anything.
- I don't understand.

531
00:43:01,663 --> 00:43:04,289
- Yeah!
- That's not funny.

532
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,624
Yeah!

533
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:12,047
Sweetie?

534
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,301
Come on,
that was kind of funny, right?

535
00:43:16,469 --> 00:43:19,179
I just, I hate it when you
don't take me seriously.

536
00:43:19,347 --> 00:43:22,015
I'm sorry, honey. I do take you
seriously. I was just trying to...

537
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:23,475
I'm just trying to lighten things up.

538
00:43:23,643 --> 00:43:25,519
I just want us to kind of
get back to normal.

539
00:43:25,687 --> 00:43:27,813
Like I was thinking maybe
we could go out?

540
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,898
- Like... like grownups?
- Yeah, right.

541
00:43:31,067 --> 00:43:33,193
Right. How am I gonna leave?

542
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:35,237
Why, why are
you laughing? We can go.

543
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:38,156
- Martine's gone.
- No, Ali can watch the baby.

544
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:41,243
With the break in, and all
the weird stuff going on,

545
00:43:41,411 --> 00:43:42,744
I just don't want to leave him alone.

546
00:43:42,912 --> 00:43:45,706
You know, we can't just
let this affect us that much.

547
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,290
If we do that, the terrorists win.

548
00:43:48,209 --> 00:43:49,626
Right?

549
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:53,463
I miss you, you know?
I miss my wife, the fun wife.

550
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,048
And I know I've been kind of a tool.

551
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:56,550
And I just wanna...

552
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,428
Oh, my God.
He looks so tired. Look at him.

553
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,849
He's almost passed out.

554
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:07,102
Yeah, I think somebody has time
for a nap. Come here, buddy.

555
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:11,106
- Bye. Bye, grumpster.
- Oh, I know. Fussy baby.

556
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,274
Fussy fussy.

557
00:44:50,605 --> 00:44:53,440
God! Hot! Oh, man!

558
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,365
Did you leave the heater
on in the hot tub?

559
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,950
- No.
- No?

560
00:45:04,118 --> 00:45:07,120
- It's like a million degrees in there!
- No. Why would I...

561
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,247
That was two nights ago,
and I turned it off.

562
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,291
- Oh, my God. Are you OK?
- Were you out there with Brad?

563
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,877
- Yeah, two nights ago.
- Honey, honey. What's going on?

564
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:17,214
It wouldn't be boiling. The highest
it goes up to is like 90-something.

565
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,299
Give me something cold.
Like, peas?

566
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,552
- Are you OK?
- God.

567
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,846
God. Boiled my nuts right now.

568
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,017
- What exactly...
- I'm gonna call that guy.

569
00:45:29,185 --> 00:45:31,478
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

570
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:36,066
All right, so all the emergency numbers
are in this cabinet.

571
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:37,442
Yep.

572
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,114
But now his new doctor is in there.
And also his allergist.

573
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:46,409
- And remember, no peanuts on anything.
- I know, no peanuts.

574
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:50,288
Make sure the doors and the
windows are locked, OK?

575
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,208
Upstairs, in the back,
out front, every...

576
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,417
- Go!
- I love you.

577
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,336
- Have a great time with him.
- Bye.

578
00:45:56,504 --> 00:45:59,756
- I love you!
- Bye. Have a good time.

579
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,634
- Take the money. Coming!
- Bye! Say, "Bye, Mama!"

580
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,679
Bye. Bye!

581
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:07,722
Don't get too wasted!

582
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,267
Bye!
Can you say bye-bye?

583
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,450
Jesus Christ.

584
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,786
- What the...?
- Hello?

585
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:32,080
- Did I scare you?
- Yes.

586
00:46:32,248 --> 00:46:35,292
Lightly. Have to warm up the board.

587
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,210
You have to warm up the board?

588
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,048
If a spirit's present,
will you give us a sign?

589
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:48,722
Like, literally, anything.

590
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,433
- Literally...
- Yeah, no, there's...

591
00:46:51,601 --> 00:46:54,561
OK. What do you want?

592
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,653
- Brad. Brad.
- I'm not moving it.

593
00:47:05,323 --> 00:47:06,656
It's not me.

594
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,659
"P"...

595
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,129
..."U"...

596
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,886
- Ali, are you doing this?
- No, I'm fucking not.

597
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:40,732
..."S"...

598
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,652
- What the fuck?
- Wait, it's still going.

599
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,863
It goes to the "Y."
Oh, it spells "pussy."

600
00:47:47,031 --> 00:47:48,948
I mean, what, what...
Hey, hey, hey.

601
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,116
Pussy?!

602
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:53,244
Maybe the spirit...
spirits want some pussy.

603
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,412
Spirits?

604
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:57,540
Yes, the spirits might
be horny at the moment.

605
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,211
- You never know. I know I am.
- Pussy.

606
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:02,962
You know what?
We should keep going.

607
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,592
- Wait, do you feel that?
- Yes, 'cause you're moving it.

608
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,885
No, I'm not moving it.

609
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:10,929
No, this time
I'm really not moving it.

610
00:48:11,097 --> 00:48:14,683
- It's...
- Wait. "H"...

611
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,602
Pussy-ehh.

612
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,731
No, Ali, I'm really, I'm really
not moving it this time.

613
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,108
I promise you.

614
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,530
No, what the fuck?
Are you doing this?

615
00:48:29,532 --> 00:48:31,241
No.

616
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,742
"N"...

617
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:39,874
- ..."T"...
- "Pussy Hunt."

618
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,503
It's like the worst
game of Ouija ever.

619
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:47,132
Did you spell that? Are you trying
to tell me something?

620
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:49,300
Yeah, yeah,
I spelled "pussy hunt."

621
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,094
Would you like me
to go on a pussy hunt?

622
00:48:51,262 --> 00:48:53,263
I can do that for
you right now.

623
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:57,934
...only $2.99
a square foot.

624
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,812
Complete bamboo flooring as low
as $1 .99 a square foot.

625
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,188
These deals...

626
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,321
America runs on Dunkin'.

627
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,907
Lumber Liquidators' warehouse
is full of mill overstocks,

628
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:14,492
bankruptcies,
buyouts and deals,

629
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,453
like six-millimeter
laminate floor...

630
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,462
...incredible prices
on the best quality

631
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:09,839
all-wood kitchen cabinets
in honey oak, hickory,

632
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:12,091
solid red oak and
sumptuous dark chocolate,

633
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:14,344
all in stock now
at our warehouse stores.

634
00:50:14,512 --> 00:50:16,513
Cabinets To Go doesn't have
fancy showrooms,

635
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,306
but they do have
superb qual...

636
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,105
Brad?

637
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:13,361
Come on.

638
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:19,742
Oh, shit.

639
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,647
Shit.

640
00:54:30,768 --> 00:54:32,351
Hi.

641
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,572
Ali?

642
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:50,995
Oh.

643
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:56,417
Oh, there you go,
that's better, right?

644
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:58,961
Ali?

645
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,005
Is Ali upstairs?

646
00:55:01,173 --> 00:55:03,841
- No, she isn't up here.
- She's not upstairs?

647
00:55:04,885 --> 00:55:07,845
Ali? Ali!

648
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:14,102
Dad? Dad? Kristi?

649
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,603
- Where have you been?!
- Oh, my God.

650
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:17,271
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.

651
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:19,315
- What happened?
- I'm so sorry. I got locked out.

652
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,526
Why would you even answer the door to
somebodyjust knocking?

653
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:23,152
- Just open the door?
- No, I thought...

654
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,695
Did you look outside
to see who it was?

655
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,572
Yes! Yes, I couldn't.
But that's the thing, see.

656
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,033
I couldn't see anybody, and I thought
that Brad was out there.

657
00:55:29,201 --> 00:55:31,285
But if you don't see anybody,
then you don't go outside!

658
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:33,079
Your little brother
was upstairs by himself.

659
00:55:33,247 --> 00:55:35,540
- I know. I was freaking out.
- Right?

660
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:38,501
I know. I didn't,
I've never, I swear to God,

661
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:39,627
I never would
have done that.

662
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:40,962
I don't understand.
What happened?

663
00:55:41,130 --> 00:55:43,506
It wasn't an accident because something
slammed the door behind me.

664
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,134
- We were worried sick about...
- What do you mean? Wait...

665
00:55:46,301 --> 00:55:50,012
I took a nap, and I heard somebody
calling my name.

666
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,848
- What?
- I felt something,

667
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,976
like somebody was calling my name,
and I felt somebody there.

668
00:55:55,144 --> 00:55:56,144
Are you sure you
weren't just dreaming?

669
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:57,478
You weren't there.
You didn't feel it.

670
00:55:57,646 --> 00:55:59,856
- The wind blew the door closed.
- There wasn't any wind.

671
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,234
All right? I don't want to hear any more
of this haunted house crap!

672
00:56:03,402 --> 00:56:05,862
OK? That's enough. You guys are
driving me crazy.

673
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,280
End of story.

674
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:14,704
It was like you said,
with the pots falling.

675
00:56:14,872 --> 00:56:15,913
- You know what?
- I was taking a nap,

676
00:56:16,081 --> 00:56:19,041
- and something was calling my name.
- Sweetheart...

677
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,545
I'm just gonna go
calm him down, OK?

678
00:56:24,173 --> 00:56:26,382
Just go upstairs
and try to go to bed, OK?

679
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,400
OK, buddy.

680
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:51,324
There you go. No, no, no.
You're eating breakfast now.

681
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:55,620
You want it
on here instead?

682
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,996
OK.

683
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,375
Morning.

684
00:57:02,044 --> 00:57:03,502
Good morning.

685
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:10,718
Nice.

686
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:21,187
Bye, little buddy.
Hot, hot, hot.

687
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:26,025
OK, Hunter. Got to eat.

688
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,860
Got to eat.
Come on, buddy.

689
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:34,492
I'm having these really
fucked up nightmares...

690
00:57:35,327 --> 00:57:38,371
...which is not something
that's really new,

691
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,122
but I'm having different ones.

692
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,208
There was one in particular.
Well, there were...

693
00:57:42,376 --> 00:57:45,878
I've had a couple dreams where my teeth
are falling out, which is really weird.

694
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,172
And there's one in particular,
where this guy is standing

695
00:57:48,340 --> 00:57:50,216
at the foot of my bed...

696
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,470
...watching me sleep,
and it's not like a scary robber dream.

697
00:57:54,638 --> 00:57:58,057
I can't see his face or anything,
but he was like...

698
00:57:58,225 --> 00:58:02,061
...about, like, a foot back...

699
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:08,150
...from the bed there. So...

700
00:58:10,529 --> 00:58:12,071
That's what's been up.

701
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:13,990
I don't get it.
How can you not want a back rub?

702
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,534
Because I'm concentrating.

703
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,703
- But you know you love it.
- Stop.

704
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:22,206
But this site says that if it's,
like, really persistent,

705
00:58:22,374 --> 00:58:26,585
which it is, obviously, at this point,
that it's probably not a ghost.

706
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:30,423
It's probably something else.
And it's possibly a demon.

707
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,134
Well, what's the difference
between a demon and a ghost?

708
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,929
Because ghosts are dead people,

709
00:58:37,097 --> 00:58:38,597
so they're, like, human energy.

710
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:42,309
And demons are not human.
They're just...

711
00:58:43,937 --> 00:58:45,271
...like, evil.

712
00:58:46,565 --> 00:58:48,149
Psyching yourself out,
looking online there.

713
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:49,275
I'm not psyching myself out.

714
00:58:49,443 --> 00:58:50,693
Remember when I told you that my mom

715
00:58:50,861 --> 00:58:52,945
thought she had that, like,
that flesh-eating disease?

716
00:58:53,113 --> 00:58:54,989
She freaked herself out.
It's kinda like that, you know?

717
00:58:55,157 --> 00:58:58,200
- Oh, my God. Babe, here.
- Let me see it.

718
00:58:58,994 --> 00:59:00,411
Like fourth paragraph down.

719
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:05,041
"It has been said that

720
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,960
if a human makes a bargain
with a demon for wealth,

721
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:10,004
power, or any other benefit,

722
00:59:10,172 --> 00:59:13,299
they must forfeit
their firstborn male.

723
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:15,718
If the debt is not honoured,
the demon will follow the..."

724
00:59:15,886 --> 00:59:18,095
Why are you smiling?
It's not funny.

725
00:59:19,014 --> 00:59:21,682
"...will follow the defaulter
and his or her brood

726
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:24,769
until its soul
of an infant is collected."

727
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:28,814
So?

728
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,277
OK, so this is
the freakiest thing ever.

729
00:59:33,445 --> 00:59:34,987
It happened to me last night.

730
00:59:35,155 --> 00:59:36,572
This is the door...

731
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:42,078
...closing by itself.
That's me walking outside.

732
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:45,414
Yeah. Dad!
Will you come in here, please?!

733
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,250
OK, please stand over here
and watch this.

734
00:59:49,169 --> 00:59:50,336
Jesus.

735
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,840
Don't look at me, look at the screen.

736
00:59:58,887 --> 01:00:00,471
Yeah. The wind blows
the door closed.

737
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:01,931
- Dad.
- Thank you.

738
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:03,933
Are you serious?

739
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,852
- It's happened to me a million times.
- There's no wind!

740
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:08,771
The wind comes from the back
when the windows are open.

741
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,815
It's inside the house
and nothing else is open!

742
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,192
Turn it off and stop
messing with the system.

743
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,693
Dad, there's obviously
something in the house!

744
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:15,820
Please, come on.

745
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:17,196
It's the same thing
Martine's been saying.

746
01:00:17,364 --> 01:00:19,031
Come get your dinner. It's getting cold.

747
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:13,043
I think I just heard something
coming from downstairs.

748
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,636
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

749
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:26,932
Oh, Jesus Christ. Fuck.

750
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,875
Shit!

751
01:02:43,802 --> 01:02:45,302
It woke me up.

752
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:48,597
Like, it sounded like
the door or something.

753
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,642
So I kind of checked it out
and Dad was snoring.

754
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:55,604
And... I caught it on here.
Do you want to see?

755
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:02,569
- Right there, you see?
- That's weird.

756
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:05,155
It's definitely weird.

757
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:08,033
It just freaks me out because
it just reminds me of like...

758
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,870
...what Martine was saying
about the house.

759
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:14,123
What did she say
about the house?

760
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,750
She said that there were
bad spirits in the house

761
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:19,295
that she had to clear out. She was
clearing out the bad spirits

762
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:22,214
and letting in the good spirits.
But something like that...

763
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:26,385
I don't have any other explanation for.
Do you?

764
01:03:27,095 --> 01:03:28,929
I don't. I...

765
01:03:30,307 --> 01:03:32,891
I remember being scared
all the time.

766
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,561
What do you mean "scared
all the time," though?

767
01:03:35,729 --> 01:03:38,731
- I don't know.
- No, but what do you mean?

768
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:42,443
- Like you felt, you felt scared...
- I don't remember.

769
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:45,154
I mean,
I've been... I'm scared.

770
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,240
So what, did she,
like, lock herself out?

771
01:03:48,408 --> 01:03:51,118
Well, she said the
door slammed shut on its own.

772
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:53,495
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

773
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,749
That's pretty darn creepy.

774
01:03:58,418 --> 01:03:59,418
Yeah.

775
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:04,423
Listen, this is gonna sound
totally crazy, and I know that, but...

776
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:06,550
I've been having this
feeling lately that,

777
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,178
that maybe whatever happened
to us when we were little...

778
01:04:09,846 --> 01:04:10,929
I think it's starting again.

779
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:12,973
I don't want to talk about this, Kristi.

780
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,184
I don't remember anything.

781
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:16,852
I just remember being
scared all the time. What...

782
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:20,564
You want to know what I remember?
I remember you crying all the time.

783
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,108
I remember you couldn't sleep,
and you got anxiety attacks.

784
01:04:23,276 --> 01:04:25,611
I remember that you
stopped talking for months.

785
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:27,363
I remember weird people
came to our house

786
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,698
and our mom was upset all the time.
That's what I remember.

787
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,867
Whatever it was, it thrived on fear.

788
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,745
The more we paid attention to it,
the worse it got.

789
01:04:34,913 --> 01:04:36,955
You need to leave this alone.

790
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,458
You need to ignore it,
or you're gonna end up just like Mom.

791
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:43,670
Do you understand me?

792
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:48,634
Yeah, OK. I will.

793
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:06,985
Wanna go for a walk?
Abby.

794
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:08,695
Come on.

795
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:39,369
Oh, God!

796
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:55,093
God! Leave me alone!

797
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,248
Yo, Kris?

798
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:09,543
Are you OK?

799
01:08:09,711 --> 01:08:12,713
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Did something just happen?

800
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,759
...completely fine.
Everything is fine.

801
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:19,428
Look at me.

802
01:08:21,973 --> 01:08:23,015
Kristi.

803
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:25,392
Honey, everything is fine.

804
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:27,769
It's obviously not. Look at...

805
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:34,151
Your Aunt Katie said that we can't
talk about these things, OK?

806
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,487
Because if you do,
it just goes... worse.

807
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:39,615
- Listen.
- What do you mean?

808
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:43,577
Everything's fine. Ali, just stop.
Everything's fine.

809
01:08:43,745 --> 01:08:45,454
OK.

810
01:08:45,622 --> 01:08:49,458
No, but listen to me. That other
website said that some people...

811
01:08:49,626 --> 01:08:53,587
...like, make deals with demons
for wealth and power.

812
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:57,007
So what if, what if
Kristi's great grandmother

813
01:08:57,175 --> 01:08:59,885
made a deal with a demon
so she could get rich?

814
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,055
I went through the entire,

815
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:04,931
I went through
the entire family line.

816
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:09,394
And Hunter is the first male
to be born on Kristi's side

817
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,898
since, at least, the 1 930s.

818
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,816
Don't tell me that shit
isn't coincidence.

819
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,116
Lie down.

820
01:10:08,705 --> 01:10:09,871
Good girl.

821
01:11:39,212 --> 01:11:40,545
- Dad?
- Yeah.

822
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:41,880
Did you hear that?

823
01:11:42,048 --> 01:11:44,132
I heard something.
What the fuck?

824
01:11:45,009 --> 01:11:48,345
Oh, God, it's Abby. Abby? Abby.

825
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,514
- What's the matter, baby?
- Oh, my God.

826
01:11:50,681 --> 01:11:52,015
- Oh, God.
- Is she OK?

827
01:11:52,183 --> 01:11:54,392
Yeah. No, no, no. Honey,
grab my keys and stuff?

828
01:11:55,561 --> 01:11:57,062
- Grab my shoes!
- What's going on?

829
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:58,939
I don't know. There's something
wrong with Abby.

830
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:00,899
- Dad, I'm going with you!
- She's still breathing.

831
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,235
- What can I do? What should I do?
- Stay here with Hunter.

832
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,110
OK.

833
01:12:04,278 --> 01:12:05,237
And I'll call you
when we get there.

834
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:06,404
- OK.
- Oh, my God.

835
01:12:21,712 --> 01:12:24,548
Just call me back
when you get this.

836
01:12:24,715 --> 01:12:26,216
Let me know if she's OK.

837
01:12:27,885 --> 01:12:29,135
OK, love you.

838
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,431
Hey...

839
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:36,518
Is she gonna be OK?

840
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:42,858
I love you. Bye.

841
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:43,812
Oh, God, please!
Let go of me!

842
01:14:53,739 --> 01:14:55,824
No, don't! Hunter! Please!

843
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,200
Please!

844
01:16:19,241 --> 01:16:21,868
No, I don't know. They thought
it was a seizure.

845
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:24,871
No, she's never
had one before, ever.

846
01:16:25,039 --> 01:16:27,499
- And she was making this noise.
- Ali?

847
01:16:27,666 --> 01:16:30,001
Babe, I got to call you
right back, OK?

848
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,836
Honey, I'm really sorry
to do this to you.

849
01:16:32,004 --> 01:16:33,421
I know this is
really bad timing.

850
01:16:33,589 --> 01:16:34,964
There's something wrong
with Kristi, OK?

851
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,050
- I can't get her out of bed.
- What's wrong with her?

852
01:16:37,218 --> 01:16:39,135
...guys from Portland. I've been
putting them off for weeks.

853
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:41,262
- I can't blow them off.
- OK, please, listen to me.

854
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,847
Can I just take
Hunter to Brad's?

855
01:16:43,015 --> 01:16:44,182
No, I need you to stay here.

856
01:16:44,350 --> 01:16:45,183
And I'll come home
when you come home.

857
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:47,852
Honey, I know this sucks.
I do, I know, OK?

858
01:16:48,020 --> 01:16:49,354
I know you're freaked
out and I'm really sorry.

859
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,356
I'll be there for like
two hours, all right?

860
01:16:51,524 --> 01:16:54,275
And I have to pick
up Abby. OK?

861
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:56,569
Please? I'm sorry, OK?

862
01:16:56,737 --> 01:16:59,364
I... call me. I'll be, like, two hours.
If anything's wrong,

863
01:16:59,532 --> 01:17:01,074
just call me and
I'll be right here, OK?

864
01:17:01,242 --> 01:17:01,991
OK.

865
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,118
I just cannot
miss this today.

866
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,662
- Thank you. OK?
- OK, bye.

867
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,664
All right, don't worry. Lock
the door behind me, OK?

868
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,624
Yeah, I mean, obviously.

869
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:13,878
No, I put him down.
He's sleeping.

870
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:17,382
She's not here.
She's still at the vet's.

871
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,720
No, 'cause they have to run tests 'cause
they don't know what it was.

872
01:17:22,888 --> 01:17:25,515
Brad, it was...
like fucking...

873
01:17:26,892 --> 01:17:28,852
I've never heard
her cry like that.

874
01:17:29,019 --> 01:17:31,896
Or just tell them that you want to come
over for an hour.

875
01:17:32,064 --> 01:17:33,189
Please?

876
01:17:34,441 --> 01:17:38,653
Please. No, I just don't
want to be here alone.

877
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:41,030
Yeah, well, basically.
She's sick or something.

878
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:45,618
OK. OK, bye.
Love you, too. Bye.

879
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:43,426
Oh, my God.

880
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:49,307
OK, so, just found this
on the basement door.

881
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,478
Um... I don't really know
where it came from.

882
01:18:53,646 --> 01:18:56,147
I think that that's blood,
but I can't really tell.

883
01:18:56,315 --> 01:18:59,734
This comes up pretty high.
I don't think she could get up there.

884
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,487
It kind of looks like letters,
but I don't really know what it means.

885
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,582
What the fuck is that?

886
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:39,857
Kristi?

887
01:19:41,568 --> 01:19:43,152
Hey, sweetpea.

888
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:44,529
What's going on?

889
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:47,865
Come here, sweetie.

890
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,034
Oh, yeah.

891
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,911
Dad?

892
01:19:52,079 --> 01:19:55,581
You have to come home right now. Dad,
you have to come home.

893
01:19:55,749 --> 01:19:58,751
Something is really
wrong with Kristi. Please!

894
01:19:58,919 --> 01:20:01,921
Please,
come home, please.

895
01:20:02,089 --> 01:20:05,383
Please, just, please, come home.
Please. Please.

896
01:20:09,805 --> 01:20:11,347
Kristi?

897
01:20:14,226 --> 01:20:17,020
Kristi? Hunter's crying.

898
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,151
Don't touch him!

899
01:20:32,494 --> 01:20:36,456
What the fuck?

900
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,835
- Are you OK?
- No!

901
01:20:41,003 --> 01:20:44,047
- Oh, my. Where is she?
- She's upstairs.

902
01:20:44,214 --> 01:20:45,923
She's in Hunter's room.
You can't go up there!

903
01:20:46,091 --> 01:20:47,675
- I have to see if she's OK.
- You can't go up there!

904
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:48,968
You have to
look at the tape!

905
01:20:49,136 --> 01:20:50,636
- I have to check on Hunter.
- She got attacked!

906
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:52,764
You have to watch the tape! Please!

907
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:54,557
Please, please,
just listen to me!

908
01:20:56,894 --> 01:20:59,312
Dad, we have to go right now.

909
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:04,901
Fuck. Dad? Dad, look at me.
Do you believe me now?

910
01:21:05,069 --> 01:21:07,779
Come on! We can't stay here! Please!

911
01:21:09,073 --> 01:21:10,490
Dad!

912
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,253
What are you doing?

913
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:26,047
She tried to warn me,
and I wouldn't listen.

914
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:28,716
Wait, who are you talking about?

915
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,135
Dad, who are you talking about?

916
01:21:33,472 --> 01:21:34,639
What?

917
01:21:38,143 --> 01:21:39,143
Olive oil?

918
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:48,820
What?

919
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:50,988
What am I gonna do with this?

920
01:21:52,366 --> 01:21:54,575
- This is gonna knock her out?
- Sí.

921
01:21:57,329 --> 01:21:59,163
I told you to stay here.

922
01:21:59,331 --> 01:22:00,957
OK, you're kind of freaking
me out right now, OK?

923
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,625
Can you please talk to me?

924
01:22:04,002 --> 01:22:06,254
Dad, look at her leg.
Look at the bite.

925
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:11,342
What the fuck?!

926
01:22:13,137 --> 01:22:16,931
No, no. No way, no way.

927
01:22:17,099 --> 01:22:19,016
We can't do this to her.
It's her family.

928
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,601
- Please, please...
- What am I supposed to do?!

929
01:22:20,769 --> 01:22:23,187
It's Kristi's fucking sister!
We can't do that to her!

930
01:22:23,355 --> 01:22:25,606
We can't do this.
We cannot do this to her.

931
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,984
Look, there is no other way.

932
01:22:28,152 --> 01:22:30,069
Yes, there is. We can transfer
it to somebody else.

933
01:22:30,237 --> 01:22:31,946
- No, we can't. No, we can't.
- That's what we have to do.

934
01:22:32,114 --> 01:22:33,990
OK? Martine said it had
to be a blood relative.

935
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,992
OK? That's my wife
and my son!

936
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,786
- That is your little baby brother!
- Do we tell her?

937
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:40,788
- Do we tell her what happened?
- No, we never tell anyone.

938
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,415
She's not even
gonna remember, OK?

939
01:22:42,583 --> 01:22:44,333
Martine said she's not
gonna remember, OK?

940
01:22:44,501 --> 01:22:45,960
And we're not gonna
talk about it, ever!

941
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:48,713
And I don't care if you
agree with me or not, OK?

942
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:50,548
It's my decision!
I'm doing it!

943
01:22:50,716 --> 01:22:52,508
What...?

944
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:59,182
Let's go, please.

945
01:23:00,225 --> 01:23:01,934
Please, Dad.

946
01:23:03,562 --> 01:23:04,896
Dad?

947
01:23:07,524 --> 01:23:10,568
Dad, please, please, be careful. Please.

948
01:23:12,321 --> 01:23:17,116
Kristi?

949
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,785
Dad!

950
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:26,834
Dad! I can't see anything! Dad?!

951
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,586
- Ali, where are you?
- I'm right here!

952
01:23:28,754 --> 01:23:29,754
Where are you?!

953
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:31,506
I'm right here! I'm right here!

954
01:23:31,673 --> 01:23:33,549
- Here, here, take it.
- Fuck.

955
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:37,136
Fuck! Where's the...

956
01:23:38,180 --> 01:23:40,014
Where's the baby?!

957
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,601
I don't know!

958
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:46,103
Dad, let's get out of here! Come on!

959
01:23:46,271 --> 01:23:48,189
OK, OK.

960
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:57,240
Stay right there, OK? Just stay there.

961
01:23:57,449 --> 01:23:58,991
- No! No, no!
- Stay there!

962
01:23:59,159 --> 01:24:00,618
Just stay behind me, OK?
Just stay right there!

963
01:24:00,786 --> 01:24:02,787
OK. OK.

964
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,290
What's happening?!

965
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:09,252
Oh, my God.

966
01:24:15,968 --> 01:24:17,468
Ali!

967
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:20,721
Oh, my God!

968
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:23,766
- They're in the basement.
- Are you OK?

969
01:24:23,934 --> 01:24:26,727
- Dad?
- Just, just stay there! OK.

970
01:24:46,164 --> 01:24:48,165
Dad. Dad.

971
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,502
- Just stay here. OK?
- OK.

972
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:59,010
Hunter!

973
01:25:02,180 --> 01:25:03,848
Oh, Jesus.

974
01:25:05,559 --> 01:25:07,602
I can't see anything.

975
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:11,689
What the fuck?

976
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:28,039
Jesus! Fuck!

977
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,838
Oh! Fuck!

978
01:25:36,006 --> 01:25:37,632
Hunter!

979
01:25:41,970 --> 01:25:44,055
Damn it.

980
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:01,864
I almost gotcha. Almost gotcha.

981
01:26:02,032 --> 01:26:04,158
OK, I got you. Oh, God.

982
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,994
I got you, little buddy.
Are you OK?

983
01:26:08,538 --> 01:26:09,955
OK, you stay there.

984
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:43,841
All right. Are you ready?
You're gonna like this.

985
01:27:44,009 --> 01:27:46,177
I am ready,
I'm thrilled. I'm excited.

986
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,680
Is it a tie? Is it...?
Oh! Shocking!

987
01:27:49,848 --> 01:27:53,601
So how are things... here?
Is there any more weird stuff

988
01:27:53,769 --> 01:27:55,561
- going on or, you know?
- No.

989
01:27:55,729 --> 01:27:57,688
- No?
- Everything's great.

990
01:27:57,856 --> 01:28:01,025
Good. I must be losing
my mind. I just...

991
01:28:02,694 --> 01:28:04,403
I feel like there's stuff
going on at our house,

992
01:28:04,571 --> 01:28:06,280
to the point where I actually
told Micah about it,

993
01:28:06,448 --> 01:28:08,324
and I'm sure he thinks I'm crazy.

994
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:10,201
You should take your own advice.

995
01:28:10,368 --> 01:28:13,162
We shouldn't talk about this
stuff. It just drives us nuts.

996
01:28:13,330 --> 01:28:15,706
- You're right.
- Sis?

997
01:28:15,874 --> 01:28:17,249
Goodbye, Hunter!

998
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:19,919
- I love you, little fella!
- Bye, Auntie!

999
01:28:21,463 --> 01:28:23,422
- Bye, sis. See you soon.
- All right.

1000
01:28:25,050 --> 01:28:27,009
What is that?

1001
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:28,552
Hello, baby.

1002
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,137
Hi.

1003
01:28:31,389 --> 01:28:33,224
Is that what I think it is?

1004
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:34,975
Yeah, it's... I don't know
what you think it is,

1005
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:36,560
but whatever it is,
it's pretty sweet.

1006
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,354
I think it's a giant-ass camera.

1007
01:28:38,522 --> 01:28:40,856
What happened to, like,
the little handheld?

1008
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:43,067
Easy to move around, versatile.

1009
01:28:43,235 --> 01:28:46,070
Are you gonna park the car or are you
gonna stand there, looking at me?

1010
01:28:46,238 --> 01:28:49,490
This is... big and impressive,

1011
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:52,409
and it has a really bright light on it.

1012
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,662
- Kiss the camera, will you?
- I'm not kissing the camera.

1013
01:28:54,830 --> 01:28:56,705
- Come on.
- How much did this cost you?

1014
01:28:56,873 --> 01:28:58,207
- What?
- How much did...

1015
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,292
I'll kiss you, but I'm not
gonna kiss the camera.

1016
01:29:27,112 --> 01:29:29,822

Katie?

1041
01:32:36,305 --> 01:33:36,656
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
