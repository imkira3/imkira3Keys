2
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,319
Trevor!

3
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:15,616
Max.

4
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:49,775
Although Wegener was ridiculed
by the scientific community...

5
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,902
...he was eventually found
to be correct...

6
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:55,114
...in his theory of an original
supercontinent called Pangaea.

7
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,283
Yeah. Okay.

8
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:07,417
Ah. Come to papa.

9
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,503
Hey, Leonard.

10
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,005
Hey, man.

11
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,384
- Dude, you ain't gonna be happy.
- Why?

12
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,845
- It's Kitzens.
- I see.

13
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,431
- Hello.
- Trevor, there's my favorite colleague.

14
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,933
- How are you, Alan?
- I'm good.

15
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,394
- How's that Con Drift class of yours going?
- Fine.

16
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,147
Does it get echoey in there
with so few students?

17
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:32,151
So, what do you got on the books?
I'm busy.

18
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:35,529
No, no, I can see how busy you are.

19
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:38,907
So I'll try to be
as quick as possible here.

20
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,619
The university is pulling the plug
on your brother's lab.

21
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:43,829
Pulling the plug?

22
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,915
Yeah, it's gonna finally give us
all the storage space we need.

23
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,002
Let's get something straight here,
this facility is dedicated...

24
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:54,089
...to the research of Maxwell Anderson's
theories predicting the volcanic fissures...

25
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:55,799
Which have never been proven.

26
00:02:55,967 --> 00:03:01,096
I mean, how many of your late brother's
sensors are even still active? One, two...?

27
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,723
- Three.
- It used to be 29.

28
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,850
This is the wrong time to shut us down.

29
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:09,771
I have got seismic activity in Bolivia.
I got a 13 millimeter shift in Mongolia.

30
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,149
Alan, you can't shut us down.
Keep the lab open.

31
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,737
- It's all I've got left of Max.
- It's been 10 years since Max, Trevor.

32
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:21,200
I am sorry about all this. I really am.

33
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,465
Trevor, are you there? It's Elizabeth.

34
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,841
Pick up, please.

35
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:42,346
Okay. Well, uh, we are on the 95,
and were heading your way.

36
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:44,806
You wanna say hi
to your Uncle Trevor, Sean?

37
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,642
No.

38
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,393
Just say hello.
- No.

39
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,104
I don't want to.
- Oh, no.

40
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,523
Hey, it's your sister-in-law again.

41
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,026
Just wanted to make sure
what time you'd be home...

42
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,986
...because well be there around 6.

43
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,947
Okay. Well, we'll be on my cell.

44
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,991
- Oh, boy.
- Sean's looking forward to seeing you.

45
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,618
- Right, Sean?
Negatory.

46
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:07,579
I'm getting worried that
we mightuve gotten our signals crossed.

47
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:08,914
Please call me.

48
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,625
I'm not home. Leave me a message.

49
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,670
Trevor, we're pulling up
in front of your building.

50
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,474
Trevor, you in there?

51
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,519
Hi.

52
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,938
- Hey.
- How are you, Elizabeth?

53
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,482
- Oh, you're home.
- It's so good to see you.

54
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,025
You too.

55
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:41,113
How are you? I just got your messages.

56
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,366
- You forgot, didn't you?
- I didn't forget.

57
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,826
How could I forget?

58
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,494
- You didn't forget?
- I...

59
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,833
I forgot.
It doesn't mean I haven't been...

60
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,002
...looking forward
to time with my nephew.

61
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,045
I haven't seen him since he was 9?

62
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,506
- Seven.
- Wow. Ha-ha.

63
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,883
So how long
is he gonna be staying again?

64
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:04,636
- Ten days.
- Is that what we said?

65
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,889
Hey, Sean. How are you?

66
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:09,808
Looking good.

67
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,228
- Is that one of those Game Boys?
- It's a PSP.

68
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:17,566
- Cool.
- Sean, get up, say hi to your uncle.

69
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,486
Hi to your uncle.

70
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:27,409
Last time I saw you,
you were about this high.

71
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,370
- Oh! Ha-ha.
- Yeah, good one.

72
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,583
You got that?
Okay, you've got all my numbers.

73
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,085
You've got your ticket
and passport in your bag.

74
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,254
I will be there to pick you up in Ottawa.

75
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:43,258
And by then I'll have found us a house
and we can start on this big new adventure.

76
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,427
- Pretty exciting stuff, huh?
Yeah, it's great.

77
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:48,430
We get to be Canadians. Thrilling, eh?

78
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:51,850
Just let yourself in.

79
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:57,022
- It will be good for him, being with you.
- Yeah.

80
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,274
Who knows?
Maybe it will be good for you too.

81
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,198
This is for you.

82
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,532
What...? Is this Sean's?

83
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,618
No, it's Max's.

84
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:12,120
- Max's?
- Yeah.

85
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,391
So, hey, dude. This is gonna be fun.

86
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:33,975
A couple of dudes hanging out.

87
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,644
Five days, maybe a week.

88
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,313
You know, doing dude stuff,
what dudes do.

89
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,483
You like baseball?
You know what we should do?

90
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,402
We should go get in a batting cage.

91
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,322
Yeah, okay, listen.
I don't like this any more than you do.

92
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,658
As long as you keep stocked
with Mountain Dew...

93
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,619
...and TiVo Family Guy,
we'll get along fine.

94
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,330
- Sure.
- Oh, wow.

95
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:57,833
- That's an awesome coin collection.
- Oh.

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,461
Well, kind of a pet project of mine.

97
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,590
- Yeah, it's really nifty.
- Thanks.

98
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,135
You hungry?
We could order in, you know.

99
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,888
Maybe some pizza, Chinese, Thai food?

100
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,682
Subs? Or something like that?

101
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,687
- Wow.
- What's that?

102
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:25,360
Well, it's a box of possessions
of a really great guy.

103
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,028
Your dad.

104
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,616
His old ball glove.

105
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:35,036
Mom doesn't talk about him very much.

106
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,913
Well, you can take my word for it.

107
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,416
He was one of those few people...

108
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:44,337
...who are just exceptional
at everything they do.

109
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:51,136
Ooh. You see this?
This was your old man's PSP.

110
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,889
- A yo-yo?
- Don't be dissing the yo-yo.

111
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,683
This is physics at work.
You got your centrifugal force.

112
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,519
Your gravitational pull,
you got your potential energy.

113
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:01,480
And in ancient times, did you know...

114
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,816
...that this was actually used
as a hunting implement?

115
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,026
Watch.

116
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:12,908
- Hey, here, let me try.
- Yeah, you should probably take it.

117
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,998
I have no idea what this is.

118
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,379
Hello.

119
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,133
This was his favorite book.

120
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:34,346
Jules Verne's
A Journey to the Center of the Earth.

121
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,267
You know, I think that was
on my summer reading list once.

122
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:43,688
- I never got to it.
- That's too bad, it's a good read.

123
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:48,568
To him, it wasn't just science fiction,
it was inspiration.

124
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,781
He used to read this to me
when I was a really little kid.

125
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,869
Hello. What are these notes?

126
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:10,465
"Magma temperatures reach 1150
in Mongolia"?

127
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,218
"Bolivia."

128
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,554
"Hawaii."

129
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,474
Look out!

130
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,401
Hey, Sean, let's go check out my lab.

131
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,112
So it couldn't wait for tomorrow?

132
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,572
Your dad used to say:

133
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,241
"Tectonophysics is the science of now,
not tomorrow."

134
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,952
It's about seismic events
that occur in an instant.

135
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,996
Here, look at this.

136
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,917
You got Hawaii, Bolivia, Mongolia.

137
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,421
And the conditions today are almost
exactly what they were in July '97.

138
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,715
What's the big deal about July '97?

139
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:54,509
Sean, that was the year
that your dad went missing.

140
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:57,846
Now, look, you see this column
of numbers here?

141
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,892
If the 753, right here, was a 752,
then it would be...

142
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,860
Exactly the same.

143
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:17,115
What do these little blips mean?

144
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,285
Don't touch anything.
Those little blips are my life's work.

145
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,871
These four little blips
are your entire life's work?

146
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:25,457
Three. Three little blips.

147
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,671
One, two, three, four.

148
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,844
Iceland.

149
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:39,721
This makes sense.

150
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:43,058
Max saw the readings 10 years ago,
and he took off to investigate.

151
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,686
Now, if the readings are the same today
as they were then...

152
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,397
...this may be my only chance
to find out what happened.

153
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,650
- I'm gonna need your passport.
- For what?

154
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,195
I'm sorry, I have to get you to Canada
a little earlier than we planned.

155
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,113
What are you talking about?

156
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,868
I'm talking about this.
A Journey to the Center of the Earth.

157
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:07,499
It's all set in Iceland,
which is where he must've gone.

158
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,751
These are all my dad's notes?

159
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,589
Look...

160
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,386
...Max and I...

161
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:24,516
Your dad and I were talking about
the possibility of volcanic tubes existing...

162
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:28,269
...that went down past the mantle,
towards the center of the Earth.

163
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:30,730
And that's what I think
he went looking for.

164
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:34,109
Sorry, I gotta put you on a flight
to Ottawa in the morning.

165
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,277
- And I'm calling Icelandair.
- No, no, look.

166
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,114
- Hey.
- I just got here, okay?

167
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,907
You're not gonna go and ditch me.

168
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:45,662
I was the person who found your life's work
fourth little blip thingy in the first place.

169
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,331
- This is my brother we're talking about.
- It's my dad.

170
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,584
Now, I don't have to be in Ottawa
for 10 days. I'm going with you.

171
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:54,254
Know how much to book
a last-minute flight to Reykjavik?

172
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,172
Something tells me you got it covered.

173
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:13,648
"Descend, bold traveler,
into the crater of the jokul of Sneffels...

174
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,402
...which the shadow of Scartaris touches
before the kalends of July...

175
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,779
...and you will attain
the center of the Earth."

176
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,573
Ooh.

177
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,658
Sorry.

178
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,664
What are you doing?

179
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:32,917
I'm deciphering these notations
that your father made in this book.

180
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,628
I think there's a code
behind the pairing of letters.

181
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:38,298
It might have something to do
with the periodic table.

182
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:40,425
For instance, I've got S-A, l-S, G-G.

183
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,804
I believe that P-B is on the periodic table
and that's plumbum.

184
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:49,100
- Plumbum means lead.
- What's "Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson"?

185
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,852
What?

186
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,855
Well, it's right here. Read it down.
Sigurbjörn Àsgeirsson.

187
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:00,570
Sigurbjörn Àsgeirsson, that's...

188
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:04,824
That's a clue. Maybe that's a place.

189
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,284
It could be a thing.

190
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,245
- What are you doing?
- I am Googling at 30,000 feet.

191
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:12,791
- Are you supposed to be doing that?
- Welcome to the 21 st century.

192
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,460
- Okay. Here.
- It's a person.

193
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,837
"Sigurbjörn Ásgeirsson,
executive director...

194
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,548
...of Ásgeirsson Institute
for Progressive Volcanology."

195
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,217
Max would've known this guy.

196
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:27,222
I knew it was a good thing to bring you.
His institute has gotta be our first stop.

197
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,103
Are we there yet?

198
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,398
If you mean annoying, yeah, we're there.

199
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,944
- You know, you're going kind of slow.
- I'm going kind of safe.

200
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:43,738
I just saw a goat in the passing lane.

201
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,949
When's the whole adventure thing
gonna begin?

202
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,867
Let me give you something fun to do.

203
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,537
Navigate.

204
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,580
Where are we?

205
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:58,253
Have we passed Havanschlicht?

206
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,797
- Havanschlicht?
- Yeah.

207
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,091
I don't know.

208
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:05,426
Have we passed Eingarsstadir?

209
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,095
- I don't know.
- Reyni? Ír?

210
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,680
- I don't know.
- Húsavik?

211
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,098
No.
Grundarhol?

212
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,600
No.
Stifflarschtarder?

213
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,935
Stifflardschtarder?

214
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:18,565
How about Koldukardarskinoquue?
What?

215
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,776
We're definitely lost.
We're not lost.

216
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,319
Just look for an institution.

217
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:28,074
What's an institution look like?
- I don't know, it looks big and institutional.

218
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,577
It's gotta be around here somewhere.

219
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,915
Hey, look, there's a little shack up there.
We can stop there and ask for directions.

220
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:41,754
- We're not lost.
- Oh, no, definitely not.

221
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,843
What's this? A ski shack?

222
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,928
"Àsgeirsson...

223
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,223
...Institute for Progressive Volcanology."

224
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,808
I told you I'd find it.

225
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,393
Alrighty.

226
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,813
- Not too shabby.
- All right.

227
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:05,820
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't speak Icelandic.

228
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,951
- Hi, can I help you?
- Hello.

229
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,663
- I'm Hannah.
- Oh, how do you do? Hi.

230
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:20,835
I'm Trev... Professor Anderson.
I'm visiting from America. Um...

231
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,339
- This is Sean, my nephew.
- I'm Sean.

232
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,466
Hi, Sean.

233
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:30,011
I was wondering if I could
possibly speak with, forgive me here...

234
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:32,013
...Sigurbjörn Àsgeirsson?

235
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:36,601
Well, Sigurbjörn Àsgeirsson is dead.

236
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:39,979
- Dead?
- Yeah, he died three winters ago.

237
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,232
So do you run the institute?

238
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,360
Nobody does. There is no institute.

239
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:49,864
- There's a sign down the road that says...
- Progressive volcanology was a failed idea.

240
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:53,701
Like, you know, the Berlin Wall
and eight-track tapes.

241
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,703
I see.

242
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,789
Well, did you work with him?

243
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,832
No, no. He was my father.

244
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,173
Yeah? I know it. What about it?

245
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:11,010
Well, this book belonged
to my late brother, Max.

246
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:12,220
Max Anderson?

247
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:17,058
We believe that he may have been
in contact with your father.

248
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:20,228
- Your brother was a Vernian.
- What's a Vernian?

249
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:24,023
Someone that believes that the writings
of Jules Verne were actual fact.

250
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:27,568
I mean, the guy
was a science fiction writer.

251
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:31,489
And yet this society of believers
regarded Verne like a visionary.

252
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:34,534
My father
was the biggest Vernian of them all.

253
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:37,078
My brother was no Vernian.

254
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,047
This was my father's copy.

255
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,882
Take a look.

256
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:56,889
See, the markings are exactly the same.
Your brother was a Vernian.

257
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,396
Wow, my dad was kind of out there.

258
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,774
- You didn't know him, Sean.
- I'm starting to think you didn't either.

259
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,569
He was no member
of some secret society.

260
00:17:10,154 --> 00:17:13,865
- What are you guys doing here?
- I'm a scientist, I'm a professor.

261
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:17,744
I'm here because there are seismic sensors
going off 30 klicks north of here...

262
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,871
...that we think
that we should check into.

263
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,623
And that's the reason that we're here,
plain and simple.

264
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,084
Okay.

265
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,587
You know,
there are no roads to the north.

266
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,338
Well...

267
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:32,300
I'm a mountain guide.
I can take you there, professor.

268
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,635
- Great.
- That's great, I love hiking.

269
00:17:34,803 --> 00:17:37,472
- I would appreciate that. That'd be great.
- Good.

270
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,850
- Call me Trevor.
- You can call me Sean.

271
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,394
So it will be 5000 kronur to go up there.

272
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,313
Five grand a day? No problem.

273
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,106
An hour.

274
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:51,194
Do you accept rolls of quarters?

275
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:23,643
Come on, boys.
I wanna be home by sundown.

276
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,688
Hey, you think you can slow down
a little bit, please?

277
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,864
- Dibs.
- What?

278
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,492
I got dibs on the mountain guide.

279
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,873
- You're 13.
- Sorry, called it.

280
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:49,043
- Thirteen-year-olds don't get dibs.
- Get over it.

281
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,804
We're getting closer.

282
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:03,975
All right, just watch your step there.
Mount Sneffels is deceptively treacherous.

283
00:19:04,143 --> 00:19:07,353
- What's Sneffels?
- Well, why don't you tell him, professor?

284
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,983
Sneffels is the name of the mountain
where this character Liedenbrock...

285
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:15,820
...apparently found a portal
to the center of the Earth.

286
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,531
Let's just find that sensor of yours,
professor.

287
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,658
There it is.

288
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:22,827
Yes.

289
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,204
Well, what do you need to do with it?

290
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,874
I gotta unlock it.
It's got, like, a black box...

291
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,587
...that has recorded
all of the seismic activity...

292
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,881
...that's transpired in the last 10 years.

293
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,424
Could tell me a lot about Max.

294
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,594
And what he was doing
when he went missing.

295
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,263
Trevor, I'm really sorry,
we're gonna have to go now.

296
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:43,598
Must be corroded.

297
00:19:44,224 --> 00:19:46,559
Trevor, we need to...

298
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:54,108
Okay, we need to take cover.
Come on, Sean. Right now.

299
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,276
I'll be right there.

300
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,571
- Trevor, just leave it for now.
I've almost got it.

301
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:00,698
We need to take cover now.

302
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,785
Come on. Trevor.

303
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:06,787
- Uncle Trevor.
- Get in here.

304
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,042
- Yes. Oh!
Watch out.

305
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,376
Hurry up. Come on.

306
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,464
Trevor,
the sensor's attracting the lightning.

307
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,634
- Drop it. Drop the sensor.
What? I'm not gonna drop it.

308
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:23,137
Hurry!
It's attracting the lightning!

309
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,490
Trevor?

310
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:45,826
- Trevor?
I'm all right.

311
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,749
Sean?

312
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,628
- Sean, you all right?
- I'm good.

313
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:06,389
- Okay, everybody, just stay calm.
Guys, come on, you gotta help me dig.

314
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,058
Come on.

315
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,817
- Forget it, it's no use.
- Forget it?

316
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:21,862
She's right.

317
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:27,660
There must be about 60 or 70 tons
of boulders on top of us.

318
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,538
Take us about a month
to dig out of here.

319
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,792
- We have to find another way.
- What if there is no other way?

320
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,461
There's always another way, Sean.

321
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,381
What else have you got?

322
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:45,678
Signal flares, first aid, some rope, blankets
and a couple of protein bars.

323
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,929
But they're on a ration.

324
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:51,267
- Don't know how long we'll be trapped for.
- Trapped? Is that what we are?

325
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,521
She... No, she didn't mean that.

326
00:21:56,773 --> 00:22:00,109
- Sean, hey, what are you doing?
- God, I'm not getting any service.

327
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,903
Sean, you're not gonna get any signal
down here, okay?

328
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,698
Put this away.
Okay, don't worry about it.

329
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:09,035
- We'll find another way out, all right?
Okay.

330
00:22:10,412 --> 00:22:12,538
One of these
might snake back to the surface.

331
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,248
How do we know which one to take?

332
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,626
My gut says we go right.

333
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,211
Come on.

334
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,844
Looks promising.

335
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,144
Just put one foot in front of the other.
We'll be out of here in no time.

336
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,565
Looking good.

337
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,654
Don't worry, direction is my sixth sense.

338
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:50,201
Pay attention, Sean.
It's just like doing field work.

339
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:51,744
I used to love doing field work.

340
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,122
Watch out.

341
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,638
You're not studying rocks in a lab,
professor.

342
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,266
- This is life or death here.
- Yeah, thanks.

343
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,478
You owe me one.

344
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,285
What does this say?

345
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,832
That means keep out.

346
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:41,210
- Maybe that's decent advice.
- No, no. This is great news.

347
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:44,755
This might lead us to an old mine shaft
and that could be our way out.

348
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:48,008
- How deep do you think it is?
- Can you give me one of those flares?

349
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,262
Thank you. Sean, look at your watch.

350
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,806
I'm gonna light this
and drop it over the edge...

351
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,017
...and I want you to tell me
how many seconds pass before it stops.

352
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,477
Okay.

353
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:03,941
Here we go. Three, two...

354
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:06,652
Oh, God!

355
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,286
What?

356
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,204
What was that?

357
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,841
Yup, magnesium.

358
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,343
Must run in veins
all through these walls.

359
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:34,889
Magnesium is kind of flammable,
isn't it, professor?

360
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,893
Yeah, used in flares,
used in gun powder, matchsticks.

361
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,731
Right, well, maybe gun powders and flares
aren't such a good idea down here.

362
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,652
Thank you.

363
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,070
It's the same principle.

364
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,450
- You ready, Sean?
Yeah, go ahead.

365
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,161
Three, two...

366
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,997
One.

367
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,458
Two.

368
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,419
Almost three.

369
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:08,422
Thirty-two squared by... It's 200 feet.

370
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:11,133
That's no problem.

371
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,929
It's about your basic 20-story high-rise.

372
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,431
- You got enough rope?
- I always have enough rope.

373
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,683
Well, no problem for what?

374
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,101
Rappelling down in there.

375
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,604
We're gonna rappel down
that deep, dark hole?

376
00:25:23,772 --> 00:25:25,523
What, you got a problem with that?

377
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,358
- Pfft.
- What's the matter?

378
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,735
There's no way
we should be rappelling down.

379
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:33,239
What are you talking about? You're
man enough to call dibs on the guide.

380
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,407
- But not enough to climb down a rope.
Guys.

381
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:39,203
- Calling dibs on the mountain guide...
- No one gets dibs on the mountain guide.

382
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,081
We're going down there.

383
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,337
Steady, steady.

384
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,340
Remember, we're all connected.

385
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,218
It's okay.

386
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,805
Looking good.

387
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,684
It's all good down here.

388
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,061
Way down here.

389
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:05,688
You guys are coming down, right?

390
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,233
All right, Sean, I'm gonna start
lowering you down really, really slowly.

391
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,153
So just lean back
and keep your feet up high.

392
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,615
You're okay, Sean.

393
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:19,660
We're tethered together,
so nothing bad is gonna happen.

394
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,329
Yeah, sure.

395
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,665
Good.

396
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,337
Sean, keep walking.

397
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,673
You have to keep walking.

398
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,926
Good.

399
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,972
Hey, you're looking pretty good there.

400
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,266
- Sure you haven't done this before?
- Shut up.

401
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:45,519
Hey, you mind?
Watch your step, will you?

402
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,354
I'm hanging on for my life here.

403
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,108
Okay, Sean,
just make conversation with me.

404
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,778
So, Hannah, do you come here often?

405
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,322
Oh, give me a break.

406
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,033
That can't be the best line
you can come up with.

407
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,953
- I'm making conversation with her.
- No, Sean, I do not come here very often.

408
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,039
Ready?

409
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:14,673
Hey.

410
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,884
Look at all this schist.

411
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,761
- What?
- It's a metamorphic rock.

412
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,722
Green schist, garnet schist,
mica-garnet schist.

413
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,392
- Oh. Schist.
- It's everywhere, look at it. I guess...

414
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,313
Trevor.

415
00:27:35,945 --> 00:27:37,988
Get to the wall, Trevor.
I can't.

416
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:41,492
- I can't, the walls widen out down here.
- Your rope is caught on mine.

417
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:44,036
You're gonna take us down.
I gotta cut you loose.

418
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,329
What?
- Hannah, no.

419
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:47,665
Wait a minute, wait, wait, wait.

420
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:48,832
- Don't.
Don't, don't, don't.

421
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,125
Uncle Trevor.

422
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,428
Hey, guys, found it.

423
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,013
The bottom's right here.

424
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:07,059
Hey, Hannah, you knew that, right?

425
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,186
Right?

426
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,813
Hannah?

427
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,950
Guys, what's this?

428
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,039
Looks like
an abandoned mine tunnel to me.

429
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,792
That's Old Bla'gils Mine.

430
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,129
It was shut down 60 years ago
after the big disaster.

431
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,714
Disaster?

432
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,632
How big?

433
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,217
Eighty-one dead.

434
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:41,427
That's pretty big.

435
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:43,762
Come on.

436
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,098
Cowboy up.

437
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,269
Hey, Trevor,
was there a mine like this in the book?

438
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,147
No, don't think so.

439
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:56,483
- Hannah?
Yup?

440
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,652
Can I ask you something?

441
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:05,325
Do you wonder if your father
and my brother weren't wrong?

442
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:08,996
Let me make something very clear
to you.

443
00:29:09,664 --> 00:29:10,998
I am not my father.

444
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:15,085
And the world that he belonged to
has nothing to do with me.

445
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,503
I understand, of course.

446
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:19,256
I didn't mean to say that it was
or that it would be...

447
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:23,177
- You know I'm still on the clock, right?
- You're still billing me?

448
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:27,097
I bill you until I'm safe in my house.

449
00:29:28,783 --> 00:29:31,560
Hannah?

450
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:37,733
What's that?

451
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:41,028
- This is the old generator for the mine.
- Hey, you don't want to touch that.

452
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,531
What are you doing?

453
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:47,242
There might be some
volatile compounds there, you know.

454
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:50,370
- Serious generator.
Hannah, that thing could blow up.

455
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,580
Stop throwing switches.

456
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,207
Don't do that. No, wait.

457
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,875
Get away from that thing.

458
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,220
Okay, I take it back.

459
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:15,354
This is it, right? I mean, the miners,
they had to get their stuff out somewhere.

460
00:30:15,522 --> 00:30:17,731
Yeah.
These tracks could lead us out.

461
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:20,567
Hey, Hannah, how many miners got out?

462
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,986
One.

463
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,739
That's a start. I call front.

464
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,574
What? No, no, no.

465
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,076
Come on, don't get in there.

466
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,078
We don't even know
if these things work.

467
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,246
They're not safe.

468
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,748
The tracks might not be safe.

469
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:41,547
Track ahead looks good. Get in.

470
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,102
Hey, Sean, it doesn't look safe.
I wouldn't do that.

471
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,438
I think I see something. It's...

472
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,775
Please tell me it's daylight.
Otherwise, I don't wanna know.

473
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,780
No, it's not daylight.

474
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,199
Oh, we're in deep schist.

475
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,251
I wish there were seat belts
on this thing.

476
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,503
You're worried about seat belts?

477
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,892
Watch it.

478
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,238
- Hannah.
- I know.

479
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,782
- Pull the brake, pull the brake.
- No, don't.

480
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:52,159
We won't make it.

481
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,339
Yeah.

482
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,009
Hey, great job. Thanks.

483
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,305
Guys.
Stay put, Sean.

484
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,317
Trevor, you okay?

485
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:29,279
Hannah, your track ends.

486
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,865
Jump in my car.

487
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,575
What?

488
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:35,869
Quick, you have to do it.

489
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,038
- Just jump.
- I know that.

490
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,376
Ready?

491
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,384
Trevor, your track ends too.

492
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:57,140
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

493
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,143
Showing the proper way
to save someone's life. Come on.

494
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,520
- Can I help?
- Okay.

495
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:07,526
Ready?

496
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:24,251
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

497
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,753
Luckily, I had a soft landing.

498
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,634
That's two you owe me now.

499
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,263
- Who's keeping count?
- I am.

500
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:44,604
That was awesome.

501
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,608
- What happened to you guys?
- Don't ask.

502
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,449
What's that?

503
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,120
Where are you going? Don't go in there.

504
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,998
What are you guys talking about?
This could be our way out.

505
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,377
There's a hole in the wall.

506
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,463
Guys, check it out.

507
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,177
Rubies.

508
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,095
Emeralds.

509
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,847
Feldspar.

510
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,768
Uh, guys, there's more.

511
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:37,491
Diamonds.

512
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,785
Bling.

513
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:48,251
Crystals are frequently formed
and found...

514
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:53,340
...in volcanic tubes.

515
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,516
This tube could take us back up, right?

516
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,768
We're not far from the surface.

517
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:07,646
When we get out, I'm getting a Maserati.

518
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,025
Money is not the only thing that matters,
Sean. People matter too, you know.

519
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,654
- Something like that.
Not if you have a Maserati.

520
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,908
Did you guys hear that?

521
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:22,035
Nobody move.

522
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,467
Tell me that's not what I think it is.

523
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,557
Muscovite.

524
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:45,642
What's muscovite?

525
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,731
- Muscovite is a thin type of rock formation.
- How thin?

526
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:55,569
Well, so thin that the slightest change
in weight and pressure...

527
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,405
...can cause it to shatter.

528
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,866
And we're standing on a lot of it.

529
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,535
Just stop. Stop.

530
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,415
Okay, they're stopped.

531
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,586
I need you to walk back
exactly the way we came from.

532
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:13,920
Very, very calmly, okay?

533
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,423
Tread lightly.

534
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,592
Heel, toe. Doing good.

535
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,136
Doing great. Very slowly.

536
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,388
Good. Come on.

537
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,353
That's it.

538
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,939
That's great.

539
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,399
- Really careful.
- Keep going.

540
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:37,903
No!

541
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,460
It's actually thicker than I thought.

542
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,894
We're still falling!

543
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,991
Trevor, what's at the bottom?

544
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,993
Well, if what Verne wrote was right...

545
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,829
...these tunnels could go for hundreds,
thousands of miles.

546
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,331
Verne was not right.

547
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,333
Trevor, finish. What's at the bottom?

548
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:35,502
Most likely theory is that it just ends.

549
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,005
Ends? Got any other theories?

550
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,175
Well, the walls of this tunnel
could have gently eroded...

551
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,344
...by water which still runs through it...

552
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:47,597
...providing a gradual break to our fall.

553
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:50,684
- Kind of like a water slide.
- Water slide.

554
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,227
Okay, that's a theory.

555
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,523
But wouldn't the water have formed
stalagmites pointing straight up at us?

556
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:59,025
- We'll be skewered.
- That is also possible.

557
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,876
Is that water?

558
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,461
Yes. Water.

559
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,338
Water slide, water slide.

560
00:38:20,506 --> 00:38:22,799
Here it comes. Hang on.

561
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,757
Sean! Sean!

562
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,676
Sean, Sean, you all right?

563
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,636
We didn't get skewered.

564
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,764
Make for the rocks.

565
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,399
Where's Hannah?

566
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:24,611
Hannah! Hannah!

567
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,794
My backpack was too heavy.

568
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,981
Thank you.

569
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:04,401
So where does that put us now?

570
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,656
Back to one.

571
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,161
Guys, where are we?

572
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,579
Are those stars?

573
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,588
No.

574
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,508
That's just the ceiling of the cave.

575
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,178
Is it just me, or is the cave ceiling...

576
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,764
...moving?

577
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,435
Yeah.

578
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:41,104
It does look like it...

579
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,689
...doesn't it?

580
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,338
They're birds.

581
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:11,134
Electric birds?

582
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,887
They look like Cyanis rosopteryx.

583
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:18,349
Only they're bioluminescent,
like fireflies or glowworms.

584
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,559
It's incredible.

585
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,739
Cool.

586
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:35,158
Glow... birds.

587
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,920
Have you seen
these creatures before?

588
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,172
Yeah, in the museum,
but they were fossilized.

589
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,592
These things have been extinct
for over 150 million years.

590
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:07,440
Where are they going?
Hey, a tunnel.

591
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,109
Guys, come on.

592
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,947
Sean, wait. Wait for me.

593
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:45,895
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the center of the Earth.

594
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,442
Max was right.

595
00:42:53,112 --> 00:42:55,029
He was right.

596
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:59,158
Max was right!

597
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,162
Your dad was right.

598
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:04,664
He was right.

599
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:07,500
Hannah, your dad was right too.

600
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,003
They both believed...

601
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:13,631
...in something
that everyone told them was impossible.

602
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:15,800
He was right.

603
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:21,264
- What's that light up there?
I can't tell.

604
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:27,353
It must be some sort
of luminescent gas combination.

605
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,647
I don't know.

606
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,609
It's like a terrarium.

607
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:36,029
A terrarium thousands of miles
beneath the crust of the Earth.

608
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:43,286
A world within the world.

609
00:43:55,341 --> 00:44:00,219
"The waterfalls, which for a long time,
could be heard flowing from afar...

610
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,057
...now cascaded along
the towering canyon walls...

611
00:44:04,224 --> 00:44:06,684
...streaming along the rock
with no end."

612
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,479
I mean,
it's the same thing Liedenbrock wrote.

613
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:13,691
Are we saying that Liedenbrock
the character was real?

614
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:15,026
That he existed?

615
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:18,738
Someone came down here.
Someone saw all this.

616
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,741
Someone got out
and someone told Verne.

617
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,701
Somebody got out?

618
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,912
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

619
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,206
Doesn't this
just completely blow your mind?

620
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:53,856
My mind is blown, yes.

621
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,952
Enormous fossilized mushrooms.

622
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,871
Sort of like humongous fungus.

623
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:14,627
- Everything in the book is real?
- Probably.

624
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,714
- And the really dangerous parts?
- I was thinking about that too.

625
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,173
Right.

626
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,843
Trevor, come quick.

627
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,302
- Sean?
- Sean?

628
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:49,787
- I'm going in.
- Yeah, wait up.

629
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,331
Hey, slow down.

630
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,167
I'll be right there.

631
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,403
Someone actually lived here?

632
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,530
That somebody...

633
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,075
...was Liedenbrock.

634
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,079
Look at all his gear.

635
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,999
All this, state of the art...

636
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,627
...a century ago.

637
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,979
Hey, Trevor.

638
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,356
I think I found Liedenbrock's notebook.

639
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,819
Look.

640
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:48,948
Looks like on the other side of those trees
there's some sort of underground ocean.

641
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,700
Yeah.

642
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,078
I don't think
that's Liedenbrock's handwriting.

643
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:02,378
It's my dad's.

644
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,590
Trevor?

645
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,467
Trevor?

646
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,307
Can I talk to you for a minute?

647
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:15,474
Out here.

648
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,060
Can you wait here for a minute?

649
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:36,704
Hey, I think I found Max.

650
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:18,371
I never really got a chance to know him.

651
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:24,377
I mean, I wish I did.

652
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:28,673
He wrote something
and I want you to hear it.

653
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:35,596
"August 14, 1997.

654
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,516
Today was Sean's third birthday.

655
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:44,480
Six weeks ago, I promised myself
I would be home in time...

656
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:46,565
...to give him his first baseball glove.

657
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:51,612
Now I'm worried...

658
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,740
...that I'll never get the chance.

659
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:05,084
I set out to make an incredible discovery
to share with Trevor and the world.

660
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:09,255
But now, I would trade it all...

661
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,967
...just to be able to watch you grow up...

662
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:17,096
...to be the brave and caring man...

663
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,349
...I am certain you will become.

664
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,938
Happy birthday, Sean.

665
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:29,734
I love you.

666
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,777
Daddy."

667
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,919
Goodbye, Max.

668
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,432
Come on.

669
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,912
According to Max's journal...

670
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,542
...we're here in this giant air pocket
that's surrounded by lava.

671
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:32,338
And during periods
of intense seismic activity...

672
00:51:35,050 --> 00:51:38,219
- Like the one we're in now.
- That's right.

673
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,846
The magma that surrounds us...

674
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:44,183
...turns this place
into pretty much just a big oven.

675
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,560
Was that what happened to my dad?

676
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:56,153
Look, I know I'm just a kid,
but I can handle this, really.

677
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,155
Sit down.

678
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,784
Max was planning an escape.

679
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:06,622
His notes say that temperatures down here
can easily hit 200 degrees.

680
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:09,208
A human being can't survive
beyond 135.

681
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:11,877
- It's already 95 degrees.
- It was 82 when we got here.

682
00:52:12,045 --> 00:52:14,380
- Temperature's rising quickly.
- So, what do we do?

683
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,465
I say that we follow Max's plan.

684
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,175
Here's what he wrote:

685
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,344
"My analysis of the original Verne text...

686
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:24,974
...leads me to believe that across the ocean
due north of my current position...

687
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,686
...is a geyser-like river which could be used
to return to the surface."

688
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,230
So, what we have to do
is get across this ocean...

689
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:35,484
...and find the geyser
and just hitch a ride topside.

690
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,861
Topside sounds good.

691
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,571
It's a little trickier than that.

692
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,906
It could get so hot
that the water'll evaporate.

693
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,783
How much time do we have?

694
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,077
Forty-eight hours. Seventy-two, tops.

695
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:47,830
Probably less.

696
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,082
Okay, so the question is:

697
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,626
What is the fastest way
to get across the ocean?

698
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,421
There's no way we can get around it,
because if we hike...

699
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,881
Oh, we don't have time.

700
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:59,091
There's no time to do that.

701
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,929
It's all in the book.

702
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,687
Hey, you all right?

703
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,522
What's the temperature doing?

704
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,357
It is a hundred degrees.

705
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,785
Eat your trilobite, Sean.
We gotta keep our strength up.

706
00:53:27,662 --> 00:53:28,913
Attaboy.

707
00:53:33,793 --> 00:53:35,127
Hey.

708
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:37,796
Don't we need a center mast?

709
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,798
No. We don't need it.

710
00:53:39,966 --> 00:53:42,134
The wind that we want is way up there.

711
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:45,721
Thermal. It's a lot faster
than what we got down here.

712
00:53:49,893 --> 00:53:51,769
Good job. That should just about do it.

713
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:54,104
Hey, I got something for you.

714
00:53:59,194 --> 00:54:01,654
What is this?
It's a compass.

715
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:02,947
It was your dad's.

716
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:06,533
I remember the Christmas
that your mom gave it to him.

717
00:54:06,701 --> 00:54:12,122
She wanted to make sure
that he could always find a way back home.

718
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:17,461
And maybe it will help you
find a way back to her.

719
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,843
- Thanks, Trevor.
- You got it.

720
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:26,845
- It means a lot to me.
- Me too.

721
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:33,227
Oh, there's one thing you should know.
Down here, the polarity is reversed.

722
00:54:33,395 --> 00:54:35,354
I mean, north is south, south is north...

723
00:54:35,522 --> 00:54:38,774
...and we need to bear due north
across the sea.

724
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,651
You mean, south.

725
00:54:41,528 --> 00:54:42,778
Exactly.

726
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,386
All right, it's starting to pick up now.

727
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:10,639
Okay, hold it. Hold it really steady.

728
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:13,058
Good, good, good.

729
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:15,519
- Good. Ready?
Yeah.

730
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,521
Three, two, one, go!

731
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,233
- Yeah.
All right.

732
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:24,403
Yeah. All right.

733
00:55:28,241 --> 00:55:29,950
Yeah.

734
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:32,578
Go, go, go.

735
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,914
Yeah. Keep going.

736
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,549
Whoa, we're going, we're going.

737
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:47,176
Hey, well, can you wait for me?

738
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:50,262
Well, get on.
Come on, come on, let's go.

739
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:08,030
He's back.

740
00:56:08,198 --> 00:56:10,115
Hey, little guy.

741
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:17,331
Seen those clouds?

742
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:18,874
Yeah.

743
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:23,295
The current's pulling us in the direction
we wanna go. We should lower the kite.

744
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,883
Can't do that.
It's a hundred and nine degrees.

745
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,093
It's getting hotter.

746
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,428
We need all the speed we can get.
Leave it up.

747
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,645
It's just a little storm.

748
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,314
Ain't no big deal.

749
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,322
Something moving down there.

750
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:53,200
Phosphorous and plankton.

751
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:55,452
It's the same thing we saw
back at the beach.

752
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,830
I don't know.
It looks kind of big for plankton.

753
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,916
Sean, we're not at SeaWorld,
so back off a little bit.

754
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,335
- All right?
- I think it's some sort of fish.

755
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:15,806
No.

756
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,063
They're everywhere.

757
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,357
Sean, I told you
we'd get to the batting cage.

758
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,859
Batter up.

759
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:29,862
Okay. Let's see what you've got.

760
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,949
Yeah. Line drive.

761
00:57:39,456 --> 00:57:40,539
- Sean!
- Do you hear something?

762
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,043
- Hello?
Sean.

763
00:57:45,211 --> 00:57:47,045
- Mom?
- I think we have a bad connection.

764
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,881
Mom, I can't hear you.

765
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,507
Where are you?

766
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:54,011
Uncle Trevor and I...

767
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,722
...we're sort of on a fishing trip and...

768
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,224
Are you having fun?

769
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,395
Whoa, no, you don't.

770
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:06,899
- Uncle Trevor just caught a really big one.
- Sean?

771
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:10,068
- My phone.
- Sean, do you know how to switch hit?

772
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:13,697
- Ready?
Yeah.

773
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:15,908
Out of the ball park.

774
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:17,201
- Sean.
- Look out.

775
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,410
I got it, I got it.

776
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:27,002
Sean.
No, no, don't.

777
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:29,087
Get away from the sides.

778
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,260
Look what they're doing.

779
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:37,596
They don't want us. They want the fish.

780
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:41,099
Listen up.
Sean, you take the tiller, we'll get the line.

781
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:42,643
Hannah, hold the slack.

782
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,686
Sean, you wanna take us hard starboard?

783
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:46,313
What?

784
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:47,606
That way.

785
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:53,070
Come on.

786
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:56,949
- Okay.
Doing good.

787
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,827
Now just let it out gently.
Let it out gently.

788
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,162
Let it out slowly.

789
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,705
It's working.

790
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,416
We're pulling clear of them.

791
00:59:11,256 --> 00:59:12,548
You're the man, Uncle Trev.

792
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,593
That's what I've been telling
the scientific community for years.

793
00:59:21,099 --> 00:59:22,391
Hannah.

794
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,142
You're safe.

795
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:30,482
The lines.

796
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,084
Got it.
Sean.

797
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:51,295
Sean, don't do that. No, Sean.

798
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,588
Sean!

799
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,258
- No, Sean!
- Trevor!

800
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,760
- Sean!
Hang on!

801
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:02,389
Don't let go!

802
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,731
No.

803
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:13,960
Trevor?

804
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,760
Hello?

805
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,181
Hello?

806
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:29,559
Hey, little guy. Where are we?

807
01:01:35,233 --> 01:01:37,943
Hey, do you know
where I can get some water?

808
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:40,070
I'm talking to a bird.

809
01:01:40,238 --> 01:01:42,364
I must be losing it.

810
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,461
Sean!

811
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:02,342
Sean!

812
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,806
Wait.

813
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:13,979
The wind blew him this way.

814
01:02:15,148 --> 01:02:17,357
We still heading north?

815
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,402
Yeah, still north.

816
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,529
He's a smart kid. He knows the plan.

817
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:25,282
I'm sure he'll be waiting by the river.

818
01:02:26,325 --> 01:02:28,118
Let's find that river.

819
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:36,460
Hey, come on, wait up.

820
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:44,801
Where'd you go?

821
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:53,560
Good job.

822
01:02:59,025 --> 01:03:00,776
Okay.

823
01:03:01,986 --> 01:03:04,029
Now which way?

824
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:11,119
South.

825
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:12,496
That's good.

826
01:03:12,663 --> 01:03:14,539
The river's north.

827
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:16,833
Okay.

828
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,546
Here, let me take that.

829
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,715
- No, no, I'm fine.
- Come on, let me take it.

830
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,967
- Trevor, I'm fine.
- Hannah, Hannah, I got it.

831
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:29,054
Let's just stop for a second.

832
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,688
Hey, we're gonna find him.

833
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:45,070
Drink that.

834
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,490
- Is that the last of the water?
- Yeah.

835
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,116
We're gonna need that. Keep it.

836
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:52,369
Hannah, drink it.

837
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,122
Come on.

838
01:04:07,093 --> 01:04:08,552
Duck!

839
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,889
- What the...?
What was that?

840
01:04:15,434 --> 01:04:17,894
Large carnivorous plant?

841
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,729
Hannah.

842
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,107
Hannah?

843
01:04:22,483 --> 01:04:25,610
Hannah.

844
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,825
Hannah.

845
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,709
Ugh.

846
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,223
Hang in there.

847
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:03,899
That's one point for me, right?

848
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:05,317
Right.

849
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:08,737
Who's keeping track, right?

850
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,949
I get it.

851
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,242
It's a magnetic field.

852
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,978
No way.

853
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,313
Magnetic rocks?

854
01:08:01,744 --> 01:08:04,954
No, no. No, no, no.

855
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,642
No. No.

856
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:54,420
You try that without wings.

857
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,727
That's the river.

858
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,564
Geyser must be inside that cave.

859
01:09:14,233 --> 01:09:18,778
Sean!

860
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:32,417
Where is he?

861
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:56,774
Trevor?

862
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:25,136
Man, I really wish I'd read that book.

863
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:59,462
I don't see him anywhere.

864
01:11:08,889 --> 01:11:10,598
Trevor? Trevor.

865
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,517
Hang on a minute. What are you doing?

866
01:11:12,851 --> 01:11:14,769
I'm going to get my nephew.

867
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:18,189
Hannah.

868
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:23,027
This is all my fault.

869
01:11:23,612 --> 01:11:25,280
Save yourself.

870
01:11:25,864 --> 01:11:27,657
Just go home.

871
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,868
I'll wait for you at the river...

872
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:33,538
...for as long as I can.

873
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:42,046
What did you do that for?

874
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:47,302
Just in case.

875
01:12:57,122 --> 01:12:59,624
Sean!

876
01:12:59,792 --> 01:13:01,959
Sean!

877
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,522
Sean!

878
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,733
Sean?!

879
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:32,490
Sean!

880
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:36,494
Sean! Sean!

881
01:13:58,183 --> 01:13:59,600
Come on!

882
01:14:03,397 --> 01:14:04,730
Oh, God, I'm glad to see you.

883
01:14:04,898 --> 01:14:05,940
Yeah, you too.

884
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,192
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

885
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:09,569
We should go.

886
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,280
Wait, wait, wait.

887
01:14:12,448 --> 01:14:15,408
- Is that the geyser?
- Yeah, that's where we're going.

888
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:18,995
Come on.

889
01:14:20,205 --> 01:14:23,833
- Haven't you ever seen a dinosaur before?
- Not with skin on it.

890
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:32,717
He's too fast. We're not gonna make it.

891
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,932
- Trevor, what are you doing?
- That's muscovite.

892
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,226
Same thing that we fell through before.

893
01:14:42,394 --> 01:14:44,228
There's no way it's gonna hold you.

894
01:14:44,396 --> 01:14:46,689
It can't hold him either. Now you run.

895
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,816
Trevor, no.

896
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:53,696
It's not breaking, Trevor.

897
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:55,865
Keep running!

898
01:14:59,411 --> 01:15:00,828
- He's gaining on you.
- I know.

899
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,080
Keep going.

900
01:15:07,544 --> 01:15:09,795
Trevor, it's working.

901
01:15:15,928 --> 01:15:17,845
Look out!

902
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,607
Trevor!

903
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:38,741
I just remembered something.
I hate field work.

904
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:41,077
Trevor, come on.

905
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,374
That was like... And then you were like...

906
01:15:46,542 --> 01:15:48,793
Yeah, I know. I'm really lucky.

907
01:15:48,961 --> 01:15:50,628
Okay, that way.

908
01:15:50,796 --> 01:15:54,298
That, no good. That, worse.

909
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:56,092
Let's go.

910
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,477
The river.
How are we gonna get to the geyser?

911
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:08,896
- Water's boiling.
- We need something that floats.

912
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,648
Anything. I could use a log or...

913
01:16:10,816 --> 01:16:13,025
What we really need is a boat.

914
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:26,998
Who had dibs again?

915
01:16:30,168 --> 01:16:31,168
Come on, jump in.

916
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:34,505
- The best mountain guide on the planet.
- Got that right.

917
01:16:37,134 --> 01:16:40,136
You didn't really think
you were gonna scare me away, did you?

918
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,930
You'll have to work harder than that.

919
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:55,693
I'm afraid I'll have to charge you extra
for this bit.

920
01:16:55,861 --> 01:16:58,029
Can I open a tab?

921
01:16:59,615 --> 01:17:01,198
What was that?

922
01:17:01,908 --> 01:17:04,702
It's not good. That's the river bed.

923
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,662
We're running out of water.

924
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:10,541
Well, guys,
you might wanna hang on to something.

925
01:17:10,709 --> 01:17:14,003
This ride is about to get a little bit...

926
01:17:22,262 --> 01:17:23,971
Bumpy.

927
01:17:27,392 --> 01:17:29,060
- Is everybody all right?
Yeah.

928
01:17:29,227 --> 01:17:31,145
Where are we?

929
01:17:32,939 --> 01:17:35,107
What's that light down there?

930
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:36,901
That's lava.

931
01:17:37,194 --> 01:17:40,071
It's magma, and it's rising.

932
01:17:40,238 --> 01:17:43,449
There's supposed to be water in this tunnel.
Steam, water shooting up.

933
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,910
We're too late for the geyser,
we missed it.

934
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:48,704
- What do we do?
- Do you have any suggestions, professor?

935
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:51,916
Without water, no steam.
Without steam, we're not going anywhere.

936
01:17:52,084 --> 01:17:55,670
This place looks like there hasn't been
water here in two, three hours now.

937
01:17:55,837 --> 01:17:58,923
- But the walls are still wet.
- That's impossible, it's 130 degrees.

938
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:00,508
- Trevor. Behind you.
- What?

939
01:18:03,303 --> 01:18:04,929
It is wet.

940
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,932
It's cold. There's water behind here.

941
01:18:08,100 --> 01:18:10,976
There's gotta be water behind some pocket
or underground river.

942
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:12,436
Trevor, it's getting closer.

943
01:18:13,271 --> 01:18:16,273
Hey, that's magnesium.

944
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:21,696
- We're slipping.
- How many flares you got left?

945
01:18:26,910 --> 01:18:28,619
Three.
What do you wanna do with them?

946
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,621
Gonna light the magnesium. On purpose.

947
01:18:32,624 --> 01:18:34,208
Hang on.

948
01:18:38,296 --> 01:18:40,589
Oh, come on. It's too wet.

949
01:18:45,137 --> 01:18:47,430
Got to get further down.
Give me another one.

950
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:51,142
Hold my legs.

951
01:18:55,939 --> 01:18:57,481
Come on.

952
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:05,156
You're gonna have to tie me off.
I gotta get down lower.

953
01:19:05,490 --> 01:19:06,824
Trevor, it's getting closer.

954
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:10,161
That's good. All right, ready.

955
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:15,624
It's the last one.

956
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,517
Trevor, be careful.

957
01:19:37,105 --> 01:19:38,689
How's that?
Little more.

958
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,357
Hurry.

959
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,322
Lower?
Little more.

960
01:19:46,948 --> 01:19:48,115
Okay, hold off.

961
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,452
- Come on.
Come on.

962
01:19:51,620 --> 01:19:53,621
Come on, light.
Come on.

963
01:19:55,540 --> 01:19:56,540
Come on, Trevor.

964
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:59,084
Still wet. Gonna have to
throw it to the other side.

965
01:20:18,355 --> 01:20:19,772
What?

966
01:20:20,232 --> 01:20:21,357
No.

967
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,067
No!

968
01:20:28,573 --> 01:20:30,324
Trevor, come on.

969
01:20:30,784 --> 01:20:32,576
- Trevor, come on.
- It's lit, it's lit.

970
01:20:32,744 --> 01:20:33,994
Pull!

971
01:20:34,329 --> 01:20:35,579
- Pull me up.
- Hurry.

972
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:36,914
Pull me up. Pull me up.

973
01:20:38,291 --> 01:20:40,042
Come on, pull it. Pull it.
Pull.

974
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:42,878
Watch the teeth. Watch the teeth.

975
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:45,047
Sean! Come on!

976
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,423
Get down, it's gonna blow.

977
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,271
This thing's heating up.

978
01:21:00,438 --> 01:21:02,022
I know!

979
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:13,284
- Hang on!
- Trust me, I'm hanging on!

980
01:21:15,453 --> 01:21:17,746
Is that sky?

981
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,137
Hang on, everybody!

982
01:21:33,305 --> 01:21:35,723
- Stop saying that!
- It just keeps coming up!

983
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,775
That's Mount Vesuvius.

984
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:31,695
Hey, Sean, if your mom asks you
what you did this weekend...

985
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:35,866
...you tell her Uncle Trevor took you to Italy.
- Italy?

986
01:22:53,885 --> 01:22:56,220
Sean?

987
01:22:58,431 --> 01:23:00,516
What? I just took
a few geological samples.

988
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,226
A few geological samples?

989
01:23:02,394 --> 01:23:05,896
A few pounds of samples, but what
do you expect? I'm a scientist's son.

990
01:23:08,233 --> 01:23:10,359
Look. Look.

991
01:23:10,527 --> 01:23:13,070
You take this.

992
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:16,407
You take. We are sorry.

993
01:23:22,622 --> 01:23:25,499
You want slide again?

994
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:28,168
Slide is okay. It's fine.

995
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,587
Anything what you want.

996
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:41,390
What was that for?

997
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:43,600
Now we're even.

998
01:23:57,115 --> 01:23:59,950
Leonard, I'm back.
Stop doing what you're doing.

999
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:02,077
What am I doing?

1000
01:24:02,245 --> 01:24:04,038
Oh, look, you're looking for work.

1001
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,415
You don't need to,
because you have a job...

1002
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:10,210
...with the Ásgeirsson-Anderson Institute
for Tectonophysical Exploration.

1003
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:12,713
The Ásgeirsson-Anderson... What?

1004
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,381
Still working on the name.

1005
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,967
But the point is, rising tide lifts all boats.

1006
01:24:17,135 --> 01:24:18,802
Man, that's awesome.

1007
01:24:18,970 --> 01:24:21,138
I think... Am I a boat?

1008
01:24:21,306 --> 01:24:24,183
- You're a boat. We're back in business.
- All right, dude.

1009
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:26,894
Well, well, well.
What's all the excitement about?

1010
01:24:27,062 --> 01:24:28,729
- Oh, hey, Alan. How are you?
Good.

1011
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,481
- What you doing?
- Oh, me?

1012
01:24:30,648 --> 01:24:33,150
I'm moving into my new lab.

1013
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:35,319
More importantly, where have you been?

1014
01:24:35,487 --> 01:24:39,323
I heard you missed your Monday lecture
and both of your students complained.

1015
01:24:39,491 --> 01:24:40,491
Oh!

1016
01:24:41,826 --> 01:24:44,203
I took a quick vacation.
Best thing I could've done.

1017
01:24:44,370 --> 01:24:45,454
That is exciting.

1018
01:24:45,622 --> 01:24:47,873
You'll have to promise
to tell me about it, okay?

1019
01:24:48,041 --> 01:24:52,211
Not sure if I'll have time, but you can read
about it in Scientific American.

1020
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:55,839
Scientific American?

1021
01:24:56,007 --> 01:24:58,550
Look, I just want to say,
no hard feelings, okay?

1022
01:24:58,718 --> 01:25:01,095
About the laboratory moving
and expansion thing.

1023
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:03,764
So I'm actually looking
for my own building anyway.

1024
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:06,767
How exactly
are you going to do that, Trevor?

1025
01:25:07,644 --> 01:25:10,020
Well, let's just say
I fell into a small fortune.

1026
01:25:12,732 --> 01:25:14,775
So tomorrow
you're gonna be a Canadian.

1027
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,236
Yep. Looks that way.

1028
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:26,036
I'd say that was a lot of male bonding
packed into very little time.

1029
01:25:26,204 --> 01:25:29,540
What do you say
we take a couple weeks next time?

1030
01:25:29,707 --> 01:25:31,208
A couple weeks?

1031
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:33,836
- What are you doing over Christmas break?
- Nothing. I'm free.

1032
01:25:34,003 --> 01:25:36,130
I just found this in your dad's stuff.

1033
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,173
Give it a read.

1034
01:25:38,341 --> 01:25:40,342
- 'ULost City of Atlantis. U'
Mm-hm.

1035
01:25:40,510 --> 01:25:42,052
We'll talk.

1036
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,223
Sean, what is that?

1037
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:49,059
- I'm just feeding my pet.
- What pet?

1038
01:25:49,227 --> 01:25:51,186
Sean.

1039
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,981
- You think my mom will let me keep him?
- I don't know.

1040
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,233
Might not even stay here.

1041
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,235
- Look at it.
- Hey, come on.

1042
01:25:58,403 --> 01:26:00,571
- This is your problem.
- Where are you going?

1043
01:26:01,072 --> 01:26:03,907
I got some food for you.
Come on. Come back down here.

1044
01:26:04,075 --> 01:26:05,659
Come on.

1045
01:26:06,305 --> 01:27:06,731
