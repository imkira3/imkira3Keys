1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:13,514 --> 00:00:14,924
Get over here!

3
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:42,281
Look. What do you see?

4
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,501
Papa.
The scorpion! It needs help.

5
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,629
Life is cruel, satoshi.

6
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,874
It doesn't care where you are from,

7
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,834
what god you pray to.

8
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,671
It is. So, you must face it head-on.

9
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,806
See the scorpion?

10
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,432
No matter how many enemies,
it continues on.

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,604
It is strong. Yes.

12
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,307
It is fast.

13
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,811
But do you know
why the scorpion is feared?

14
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,317
Its will.

15
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:23,280
Willpower is what makes
your destiny your own.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,833
Learn to be strong, here and here.

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:29,752
Promise me you'll remember that.

18
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:31,497
I will, papa.

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,420
Now let's get home.

20
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,011
Your mother is making dinner
and she won't be happy if we're late.

21
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,102
Hold on.

22
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,476
Faster, papa! Faster!

23
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:51,899
Morel

24
00:01:53,739 --> 00:01:55,070
your papa needs a break.

25
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,100
Where is everyone, papa?

26
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:27,723
Hold tight, satoshi.

27
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,656
Harumi.

28
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:34,023
Harumi.

29
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:37,485
Harumi!

30
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,819
Mama...

31
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,004
Enough!

32
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,889
Come further and he dies.

33
00:07:18,188 --> 00:07:19,303
What do you want?

34
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:22,392
On your knees.

35
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,499
If you touch a hair on his head...

36
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Papa!

37
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:53,716
Papa...

38
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,636
Satoshi!

39
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,601
Satoshi!

40
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:02,603
Papa.

41
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,231
Satoshi.

42
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,483
Satoshi!

43
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,482
Satoshi!

44
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,661
I'll kill you!

45
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,455
I'll kill you!

46
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:43,311
You'll die for this.

47
00:08:43,815 --> 00:08:44,815
You first.

48
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Ll ord Raiden!

49
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,447
I'm sorry. I...

50
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,116
I didn't know.

51
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,774
No. You did well, liu kang.

52
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,484
Just as you were taught.

53
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,654
And now, I pray it is enough.

54
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,210
Enough?

55
00:10:28,795 --> 00:10:30,080
Then it is time.

56
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:32,162
Yes. Do not worry.

57
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,291
We have prepared for this moment
for a long time.

58
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:38,009
I chose you for a reason, liu kang.

59
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:41,546
Now, the others will be gathering.

60
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:43,016
We must hurry.

61
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:46,009
Lord Raiden. What others?

62
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,076
No, no. Listen...

63
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,606
We can make this work. I promise.

64
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,734
What do I have to do? Huh?

65
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:57,775
How 'bout cleaning this hell hole
you call a home?

66
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,365
How 'bout doing something besides
crying about your career?

67
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,942
You only care about yourself.

68
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,115
It's all about Johnny cage.

69
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:06,821
Call me when you grow up!

70
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:15,672
So... I can still call her then.

71
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,050
That's a w.

72
00:11:43,995 --> 00:11:45,951
Hey! You're in the cage with Johnny.

73
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:49,656
Oh, well.
If it isn't my long-lost agent.

74
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:50,911
It's about time you called.

75
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,327
Well, of course
I'm interested in something different.

76
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:55,958
What have I been telling you, yeah?

77
00:11:56,591 --> 00:11:58,127
China? Uh-huh.

78
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:01,509
All right, will. What about an advance?

79
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,177
Things have gotten a little...

80
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,516
Little tight around here...

81
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:08,967
Hello? Hello?

82
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,057
Well, I'm off to chinal

83
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,246
Kick him in the face!

84
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:48,097
You gonna keep crying like a bitch
or fight like a man?

85
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:06,983
Yeah, yeah. That's right.

86
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,361
This is no place for a little girl.

87
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,447
This is no place for a little girl.
This is no place for a little girl.

88
00:13:12,542 --> 00:13:14,954
This is no place for little girls.

89
00:13:16,421 --> 00:13:17,911
Do you think this is funny?

90
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:19,792
Congratulations, cadet.

91
00:13:20,091 --> 00:13:23,254
You've just become my new pet project.

92
00:13:24,554 --> 00:13:27,967
You think you're pretty special,
don't you, Princess?

93
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:31,049
Sir! My name is Sonya blade,

94
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:34,807
and I'm gonna be
the best soldier you've ever met, sir!

95
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,687
We'll see about that.

96
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,357
You wanted to see me, sir?

97
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:40,892
Yes, I did.

98
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:43,068
I'm puttin' together a task force.

99
00:13:43,281 --> 00:13:44,896
High-level spec-op stuff.

100
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,613
Are you in?

101
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,123
I'm gonna kill you!

102
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,493
You're gonna try.

103
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,299
Yeah!

104
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:12,890
That's my car!

105
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:18,726
Not yet, whore.

106
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:31,359
My teeth! My teeth!

107
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,528
Honestly, it's an improvement.

108
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,705
Oh, shit!

109
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:51,880
Sonya! Sonya! Sonya!

110
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:01,806
He'll be there.

111
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:03,735
If he's not,

112
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,527
there's nowhere on earth
you'll be able to hide from me.

113
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,031
Understand?

114
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:32,969
Satoshi.

115
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,558
Harumi!

116
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,345
What is this?

117
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,725
Where am I?

118
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,942
Don't start without me.

119
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:59,322
Ah. Fresh meat.

120
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,580
What in the hell?

121
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,457
Close.

122
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:12,043
Netherrealm.

123
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,515
It's no use.

124
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:21,807
You are a prisoner here.

125
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,682
For how long?

126
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,354
Forever.

127
00:16:33,034 --> 00:16:34,570
Listen.

128
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:41,406
Ah.

129
00:16:42,627 --> 00:16:44,083
Do you hear it?

130
00:16:44,462 --> 00:16:46,623
The symphony of pain.

131
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:50,874
Your voice will soon join the others,

132
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:55,591
rising up to please the great shinnok.

133
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,089
Shinnok?

134
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:01,267
The master of netherrealm.

135
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,519
There.

136
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,775
The only place of reprieve
in this realm.

137
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:13,647
Look on it and weep.

138
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,122
Sharp enough.

139
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,384
Calm yourself.

140
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:39,760
Save your energy
for what is about to come.

141
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,934
Now you see?

142
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,733
You'll feel pain,

143
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:54,320
though you can no longer perish.

144
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:57,023
We can do this

145
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,781
for all eternity.

146
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,626
Huh?

147
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,750
What is it you say?

148
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,790
Is that a prayer?

149
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:19,971
No. No god can help you here.

150
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,215
I need no god.

151
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:46,911
I will take pleasure in
ripping your flesh from your bones!

152
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:20,902
Human.

153
00:19:21,327 --> 00:19:23,943
You have made a big mistake.

154
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,285
There are thousands of us

155
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,495
and only one of you.

156
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,091
Minus one.

157
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,095
Shinnok!

158
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:27,215
No. Shinnok is indisposed.

159
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:29,475
Then go fetch him for me.

160
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,093
If only I could.

161
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,312
I am quan chi,

162
00:20:33,399 --> 00:20:35,435
in charge of this realm

163
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:37,357
until the master's return.

164
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,853
And who do I have to thank
for ruining my rug?

165
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:42,938
Hanzo hasashi.

166
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:46,150
Your reputation precedes you,
hanzo hasashi.

167
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:47,569
Welcome.

168
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:51,072
Though, I'm not entirely sure
how you made it here.

169
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,458
What is it you want, hanzo?

170
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,248
To return home

171
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,454
to seek my revenge.

172
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,674
Home?

173
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:03,792
You can't return home.

174
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,138
You will do as I say

175
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,474
or I will flay you alive.

176
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,101
Did you think me defenseless, dog?

177
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:22,653
In my realm, no less.

178
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,110
You may be a vengeful spirit,

179
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:29,114
but even they have their limits.

180
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:48,137
Besides, that's not what
you really want, is it?

181
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,842
Once a generation,
there is a tournament.

182
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,386
During that time,

183
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,304
the vell is lifted,

184
00:21:57,483 --> 00:22:00,975
so that warriors may gather
to fight on behalf of their realm.

185
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,943
I can send you there.

186
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,564
Why would I fight for you?

187
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:10,446
Because, he will be in attendance.

188
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:16,244
What do you want?

189
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:22,038
Good. Skilled and smart.

190
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:27,301
Long ago, my master, shinnok,

191
00:22:27,388 --> 00:22:29,720
was unjustly imprisoned.

192
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:32,636
This is the key to his release.

193
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,597
It's being kept at
the temple of shang tsung,

194
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,435
the putrid mortal

195
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:40,310
that has the favor
of the emperor of outworld.

196
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:43,438
The tournament will
take place on his island.

197
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,644
Get me that key.

198
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:48,734
Once my master is released,

199
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,733
he can return your family,

200
00:22:50,995 --> 00:22:54,408
even you, back to the mortal realm.

201
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,991
Do we understand each other, hanzo?

202
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,457
Hanzo is dead.

203
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,580
Call me scorpion.

204
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,387
Hold the boat! I'm comin'.

205
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:24,267
Comin' through. I'm...

206
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:26,443
Whoa, whoa.

207
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,114
Hmm.

208
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:33,536
Hmm?

209
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,825
Hope no fans saw that.
I'm wearing slip-ons.

210
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,545
Liu kang of the white lotus society.

211
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:52,461
But you probably knew that.

212
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,513
And you are?

213
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,594
Not interested.

214
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,467
Oh, you will be.

215
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,642
They always are.

216
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,345
So, you guys in this thing, too?

217
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,808
Yes. I have trained many years
for this moment.

218
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,350
Oh, yeah? Listen.

219
00:24:06,654 --> 00:24:08,235
I love acting classes and all,

220
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,529
but they're really kind of a time suck.

221
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,106
You know what I mean? No?

222
00:24:12,201 --> 00:24:14,863
Anyway, my agent said this would really
put me back on the map.

223
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,161
Kind of a back-end deal-type thing.
Should be fun.

224
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,078
We are approaching the veil.

225
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,959
Who's that? Let me guess.
He's kinda like our Merlin?

226
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:25,794
That is lord Raiden,

227
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,709
protector of earthrealm.

228
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,382
Boom! Nailed it. Wait. Earthrealm?

229
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,238
Did you guys get
a script already or somethin'?

230
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,377
Look, I'd love a copy.

231
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:35,254
I've no idea what you're talking about,

232
00:24:35,391 --> 00:24:38,098
but I am pretty good
at improv, so, uh...

233
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,642
Lord Raiden, right?

234
00:24:41,397 --> 00:24:42,432
Good to meet you.

235
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,847
So, tell me more about this veil.

236
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:47,645
The space between realms

237
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,149
to prevent outworld
from merging with earthrealm.

238
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,480
Prevented by what?

239
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:54,114
Always the soldier.

240
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:55,949
Evaluating risks.

241
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:59,320
What guards the vell
is of less consequence

242
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,825
than why it does so.

243
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,452
If shao kahn wins this tournament,

244
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,577
earth as you know it
will cease to exist.

245
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,624
Not to fear, lord Raiden.

246
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,047
L, Johnny cage,

247
00:25:10,259 --> 00:25:12,796
will make sure that earthrealm, so dumb,

248
00:25:12,886 --> 00:25:14,501
will be safe from harm.

249
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,132
You have my word on it.

250
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:25,725
Lord Raiden, these are
the champions you gathered?

251
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,647
You doubt my choices?

252
00:25:27,818 --> 00:25:29,479
No. I just meant...

253
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,523
You see only what is
in front of you, liu kang.

254
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:34,862
But your eyes deceive you.

255
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,316
It 1s what is inside that matters.

256
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:38,859
Sonya blade,

257
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,365
a most formidable warrior.

258
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,077
She has had
to prove herself against many

259
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:45,908
who thought she was nothing more

260
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,743
than a weak girl.

261
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:51,334
Believe me, she is anything but.

262
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,467
And him?

263
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,340
He only seems to be
concerned about himself

264
00:25:54,428 --> 00:25:55,948
- and material wealth.
- One, one, one!

265
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,963
- Come on.
- That will keep him alive

266
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:02,136
until he finds something more
to care about.

267
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:05,223
Something greater than himself
to live for.

268
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,849
Are you kidding me?

269
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:09,811
I paid extra for international
and I can't even get a signal.

270
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:11,441
Raiden, are you getting one?

271
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,866
What in the...

272
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,409
Stay in the vessel.

273
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:27,498
It is under lord Raiden's protection.

274
00:26:27,711 --> 00:26:30,202
Out there... is nothing good.

275
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:33,206
Oh. Right. Paparazzi.

276
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,875
We've arrived.

277
00:27:13,966 --> 00:27:14,966
Look.

278
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:26,975
That must be the bad guy.

279
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:33,311
One at a time, everybody. One at a time.

280
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,350
Brought enough for everyone. Okay.

281
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,901
Where'd you guys put my trailer?

282
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,900
I'd like to freshen up
before we start shooting.

283
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,491
Ugh.

284
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,990
He has no idea what he's doing.

285
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:47,283
Should we tell him?

286
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,915
His journey is one of discovery.

287
00:27:50,419 --> 00:27:53,081
Besides, I find it amusing.

288
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,475
Remember our deal, scorpion.

289
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:39,675
Whoa.

290
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,423
Be on guard.

291
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,047
Shang tsung is not to be trusted.

292
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:26,003
Oh, look, craft services. Great!

293
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:41,560
Hmm.

294
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,986
Hey. Do you know if
any of this stuff is organic?

295
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,066
Just askin'. Jeez.

296
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,408
Now is your chance.

297
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,695
In the beginning

298
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:27,856
were the elder gods.

299
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:30,950
In their wisdom,

300
00:30:31,038 --> 00:30:32,949
they created a tournament

301
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,905
to safeguard each realm

302
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,740
from the threat of invasion.

303
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,243
Once a generation,

304
00:30:39,588 --> 00:30:42,000
the finest warriors must do battle

305
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,456
to decide the fate of their realm.

306
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,338
The winner will be granted long life

307
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,965
and great power.

308
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,673
If one realm wins the tournament
ten times,

309
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,467
they will have the right
to merge with the other

310
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,886
and rule as they see fit.

311
00:30:58,315 --> 00:31:00,271
I, shang tsung,

312
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:03,108
emissary of the great shao kahn,

313
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,311
emperor of qutworld,

314
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,230
winher of the last nine tournaments

315
00:31:08,325 --> 00:31:09,940
against earthrealm,

316
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:13,777
welcome you to mortal kombat.

317
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:15,154
Yeah!

318
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,988
Mortal kombat!

319
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,377
Now, as host of this tournament,

320
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,128
I think it only fitting

321
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:13,049
that I provide you
with some... entertainment.

322
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,021
Kano.

323
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,615
Jax!

324
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:43,833
Jax!

325
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,079
Listen, you son of a bitch.

326
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:48,830
You better open this...

327
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,294
Whatever it is,

328
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:53,798
or I'm gonna use your ass
as my own personal punching bag.

329
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,428
Oh, that is so hot.

330
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,719
Princess. “Asshole.

331
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,390
I told you to wait for me.

332
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:04,688
I got excited.

333
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:07,607
You got caught by that idiot kano.

334
00:33:08,153 --> 00:33:09,689
Yeah. That too.

335
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:14,945
Unless you want me to rip that
pencil-thin mustache off your face,

336
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:18,368
I think it's best
you let me go, old man.

337
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,994
Absolutely.

338
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,705
You are free to leave at any time.

339
00:33:22,918 --> 00:33:24,829
The doorway is right there.

340
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,995
Of course,

341
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,547
you have to get past my champion.

342
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:37,008
Goro! Goro! Goro!

343
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,703
What the hell?

344
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,218
Jax! Nol

345
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,428
relax, kid.

346
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,846
I've got this.

347
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:29,723
All right, ugly.

348
00:34:29,818 --> 00:34:31,979
You wanna dance? Let's dance.

349
00:34:58,013 --> 00:34:59,013
I wouldn't.

350
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,802
Let me guess.

351
00:35:04,144 --> 00:35:07,102
Quan chi promised you life
if you would do his bidding.

352
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,437
Ah. No.

353
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:13,187
Not you. Someone else.

354
00:35:13,403 --> 00:35:14,563
Someone you lost.

355
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,357
Someone you care about.

356
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,569
Do you think quan chi
is a man to be trusted?

357
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,525
What choice do I have?

358
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,364
We all have choices.

359
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,116
Live in the past,

360
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,244
or live for the future.

361
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:31,452
The key won't solve your problems.

362
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,495
It will, however,

363
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,296
create new ones.

364
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,173
And my revenge?

365
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,218
Revenge is too heavy a burden to carry.

366
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:41,928
You are a free man.

367
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,510
It's time you start acting like it.

368
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,197
Get him!
Come on! You can do better.

369
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,300
Really, goro.

370
00:36:28,395 --> 00:36:30,181
You shouldn't play with your food.

371
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,284
Stop it! You'll kill him!

372
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,032
That's the idea.

373
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,700
Finish him.

374
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,595
Nol

375
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,308
Fake.

376
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:17,686
These special effects suck.

377
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:22,903
Enough!

378
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:36,243
You forget yourself,
lord Raiden.

379
00:37:36,588 --> 00:37:39,045
You are not to interfere
in the tournament.

380
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,706
I was unaware the tournament had begun.

381
00:37:53,855 --> 00:37:56,437
We are here for mortal kombat,

382
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,357
not your barbarism.

383
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:03,236
As you wish. Kano!

384
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:11,157
Jax! Hold on! I'm comin' for you.

385
00:38:11,331 --> 00:38:12,616
You hear me?

386
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,997
No matter what,

387
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,823
I'm comin' for you.

388
00:38:15,919 --> 00:38:18,160
Wow. She's great.

389
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,795
I mean, that is
some serious method acting, there.

390
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:21,882
Am I right?

391
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,882
I can see we're all anxious
to get started.

392
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,807
Good.

393
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:32,632
I have determined your opponents

394
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,018
and where on the island you will fight.

395
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,971
Let mortal kombat begin.

396
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,368
Uh...

397
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,366
Okay? That was weird.

398
00:38:54,541 --> 00:38:56,247
Did someone slip me something,

399
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,329
or... holy shit!

400
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,298
Hello?

401
00:39:03,633 --> 00:39:06,090
Sonya? Lord Regan? Radar?

402
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,177
Whatever your name is.

403
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,261
This thing better not
go straight to video.

404
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,324
Gunpowder?

405
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,824
Must be some sort of old fortress.

406
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,300
Bingo.

407
00:39:56,269 --> 00:39:57,384
Hard as a fossil.

408
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,389
No craft services, no trailers...

409
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,516
My agent is gonna hear about this
when I get home.

410
00:40:04,736 --> 00:40:05,976
Sheesh!

411
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,822
Hello?

412
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,530
I should at least get a per diem.

413
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,906
Oh, hey. How's it goin'?

414
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,951
That... that is one hell of a costume.

415
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,416
Uh, are we live?

416
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,505
Like... like... you wanna do this now?

417
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,596
Whoa. Buddy! Pro tip.

418
00:40:35,725 --> 00:40:37,431
Next time, pop a few mints.

419
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:43,722
Whoa! Whoa!

420
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,224
Go easy! We haven't even run parts.

421
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:51,237
Hey! Asshole! That was custom.

422
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,574
Dick!

423
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,031
That and this!

424
00:41:01,334 --> 00:41:03,165
And barrel!

425
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,093
Eat me, buttercup.

426
00:42:16,242 --> 00:42:17,448
Toasty.

427
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,400
Come on!

428
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:58,982
Face me like a man.

429
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:28,265
All right, asshole.
Let's see what you got.

430
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,415
Not so fun now, is it,

431
00:44:31,544 --> 00:44:33,205
you cold-blooded bastard.

432
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:36,464
Heads up!

433
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,756
Fuck with the blade,

434
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,838
you're gonna get cut.

435
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,749
You move like the shirai ryu,

436
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,576
but they are dead.

437
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,079
Who are you? What do you want?

438
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:20,172
Revenge.

439
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:26,637
Tell me, lin kueil scum.

440
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,802
Where is sub-zero?

441
00:45:33,189 --> 00:45:35,396
Die knowing I will kill

442
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:39,601
every last member of the lin kuel
on this island.

443
00:45:39,779 --> 00:45:43,112
Every last one.

444
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,750
You are Raiden's chosen one?

445
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,887
No wonder your realm
has lost so many tournaments.

446
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,314
I do not wish to hurt you.

447
00:46:19,652 --> 00:46:21,017
Spare me your pity.

448
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:34,663
Do not get up.

449
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:38,914
I take no pleasure
in hurting such a worthy foe.

450
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,206
But know this.

451
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:41,788
I will do whatever it takes

452
00:46:41,882 --> 00:46:44,339
to defend earthrealm
and win this tournament.

453
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,467
Then you are a fool.

454
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:49,887
Shao kahn cannot be defeated.

455
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,714
He will take your world

456
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,801
and you will bow your knee
like countless others before you.

457
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,097
I promise you,

458
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,767
I will never bow before that madman.

459
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:02,809
I yield.

460
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,564
What makes you so sure you will win?

461
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:12,113
Because I have something
no one in outworld has.

462
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,320
- What?
- Hope.

463
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,844
Impressive, Raiden.

464
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,180
Your warriors have made it further
than I would've thought.

465
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,271
They are strong in spirit, shang tsung.

466
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,852
You will not win today.

467
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,692
I have heard such promises before.

468
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:50,819
Thankfully, after goro kills
whomever makes it to the final round,

469
00:47:51,285 --> 00:47:53,367
I will not have to hear them again.

470
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:55,490
And quan chi,

471
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,909
your warrior from netherrealm,

472
00:47:58,459 --> 00:48:00,666
he's proving to be quite formidable.

473
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:02,786
For the glory of outworld,

474
00:48:03,089 --> 00:48:05,876
I serve at the pleasure of shao kahn.

475
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:08,256
Indeed.

476
00:48:08,677 --> 00:48:10,008
You won't succeed.

477
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,887
No matter how many foes you put between
the earthrealm fighters

478
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,214
and your champion,

479
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,049
they will make it to the end.

480
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,395
Oh.

481
00:48:19,021 --> 00:48:20,886
I'm glad you feel that way.

482
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,764
Surely, you know of the black dragon.

483
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:27,192
It seems that several
have made it onto the island

484
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,736
with orders to kill
your earthrealm friends.

485
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:31,609
How dare you!

486
00:48:32,952 --> 00:48:35,694
Are you accusing me
of something, lord Raiden?

487
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,530
You brought them here
to interfere with the tournament.

488
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,239
And break the rules?

489
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,575
Even I am not so bold

490
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,207
as to anger the elder gods
in such a way.

491
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,789
You will not succeed, shang tsung.

492
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:51,425
We'll know soon enough, won't we?

493
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,692
Ah.

494
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:15,236
Hey! Really?

495
00:49:15,870 --> 00:49:18,202
I know. Look at this shirt.
It's ridiculous.

496
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,661
I'm glad to see you, though.

497
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,122
Okay. You won't believe this,

498
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,329
but this isn't some sort of movie.

499
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:25,705
This is the real deal.

500
00:49:25,838 --> 00:49:28,045
Maybe a snuff film or something.
I don't know.

501
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:29,793
But I had to fight some, uh...

502
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,548
I don't even know what it was.

503
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:33,087
I barely got out alive.

504
00:49:33,721 --> 00:49:35,086
I can believe that.

505
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:37,217
Listen, I'll get you out of here,

506
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:38,673
but we'll need to stick together.

507
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,179
First rule of combat
is to secure our position.

508
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:44,261
Let's find somewhere to hole up
and then we can start recon.

509
00:49:44,398 --> 00:49:46,434
Find out where we are,
what we're up against.

510
00:49:46,567 --> 00:49:47,687
A sound strategy.

511
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,392
You both made it. Good.

512
00:49:50,571 --> 00:49:52,311
I fear it's only gonna
get harder from here.

513
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,442
Whoa. Walt.
What's gonna get harder?

514
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:57,408
I just fought a walking pair of teeth
on the side of a mountain.

515
00:49:57,620 --> 00:49:59,076
I'm not Tom Cruise, you know.

516
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,371
I act.

517
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,909
I leave that stunt shit
for the stunt people.

518
00:50:03,209 --> 00:50:05,495
Listen, sweetheart.
We should get out of here...

519
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,085
My dick!

520
00:50:08,172 --> 00:50:10,629
Fuck balls! No one touches me
without permission.

521
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,297
- You got it?
- Got it.

522
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:13,794
You said you knew where we were?

523
00:50:13,886 --> 00:50:14,886
I do.

524
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:16,294
But it will be dark soon.

525
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,591
We need to make camp. Rest.

526
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:19,849
Agreed.

527
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:27,221
No, no. Don't wait for me. I'm fine.

528
00:50:27,399 --> 00:50:30,357
Let me just pee out some blood first.

529
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:47,123
What the fuck?

530
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,245
I think I'm gonna be sick.

531
00:50:56,095 --> 00:50:57,095
Stay behind me.

532
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,217
I'll take care of this.

533
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,091
What is this, 1950?

534
00:51:00,224 --> 00:51:01,714
Step back, Bruce Lee.

535
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,181
Bring it, bitch.

536
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:04,099
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

537
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,177
Everyone just chillax. Okay?

538
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,016
No one needs to fight anyone,

539
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,849
especially some guy that
just went psycho on a bunch of, uh...

540
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:13,229
Black dragon. Mercenaries.

541
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,149
Assassins. Bad guys.

542
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,571
Yeah. Those guys.

543
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:18,693
We have to continue.

544
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,737
Once mortal kombat has been declared,

545
00:51:20,828 --> 00:51:21,863
it must be finished.

546
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,902
Did you declare mortal kombat?

547
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,447
- Did you?
- Nope.

548
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,417
Well, what about you, Mr...

549
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:30,955
Scorpion.

550
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,832
Oh. It's catchy. I like that.

551
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:34,250
Did you declare mortal kombat?

552
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:39,502
Good. Good. Great.
Then no one needs to die. Sheesh.

553
00:51:41,557 --> 00:51:43,673
Now, who's hungry?

554
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:52,030
I know you didn't
believe it before,

555
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:53,151
but it's all true.

556
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,810
The elder gods,
the tournament, everything.

557
00:51:56,280 --> 00:51:57,440
Emperor shao kahn

558
00:51:57,573 --> 00:51:59,814
has won nine previous
mortal kombat tournaments.

559
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,117
If he wins a tenth...

560
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:03,286
Then what?

561
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,577
Then you all die.

562
00:52:06,248 --> 00:52:08,159
Great. Just great.

563
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,993
Yeah. Okay.
Monsters, magic, this can't be real.

564
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,043
Somebody must've slipped something
into my drink.

565
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:15,291
I'm hallucinating.

566
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:16,417
Get a grip, Johnny.

567
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,295
Whatever this is, it's real.

568
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,794
There's no use sitting around
and whining about it.

569
00:52:22,473 --> 00:52:24,213
If what liu kang says is true,

570
00:52:24,308 --> 00:52:25,798
then the whole world is in trouble,

571
00:52:25,893 --> 00:52:27,383
and we have to stop it.

572
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,723
If I can get to a radio,

573
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,682
the communications array,

574
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,139
I can call in reinforcements.

575
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:35,732
Turn this island
into the next cautionary tale.

576
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,773
If only it were that easy.

577
00:52:39,073 --> 00:52:41,064
- Lord Raiden.
- You.

578
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,987
What do you mean,
"if only it were that easy"?

579
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,447
Do you know what
a hellfire missile can do?

580
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,991
I'm sure it's very powerful on earth,

581
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,912
but we are not on earth.

582
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:56,291
This island lives
in a place between realms,

583
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:59,628
a place set aside specifically
for the tournament.

584
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,709
Uh-huh. Sure. Sounds great.

585
00:53:01,804 --> 00:53:04,386
So, if what liu kang says is true,

586
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:07,635
then you're really
some sort of god, right?

587
00:53:07,768 --> 00:53:09,633
I have been given many names.

588
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,184
Well, shoot, Buddha.

589
00:53:11,313 --> 00:53:12,928
Snap your fingers, get us home.

590
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,685
I am done with
psycho monsters and bad food.

591
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:16,818
And by the way,

592
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,897
I'll never complain about
doing a sequel again in my life.

593
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,155
He cannot.

594
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:24,069
Lord Raiden is forbidden from
interfering in the tournament.

595
00:53:24,785 --> 00:53:26,696
It is a bargain he made
to save earthrealm

596
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:28,448
from being taken over eons ago.

597
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,905
Well, that's... that's insane.

598
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,906
The fate of the world is being decided

599
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,037
by some sort of karate tournament?

600
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:39,413
You are the only hope left
for earthrealm.

601
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:40,918
Head toward the temple

602
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,133
where your final battles await.

603
00:53:43,846 --> 00:53:46,383
And your destinies will be made clear.

604
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:47,797
But be on guard,

605
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:49,594
there are others on this island

606
00:53:49,685 --> 00:53:52,222
who will try to keep you
from the final round.

607
00:53:57,276 --> 00:53:59,938
Great. So, uh, we are screwed.

608
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,229
If lord Raiden believes we can make it,
we can.

609
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:05,489
No. You can't.

610
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:09,235
Well, you seem very fun, Mr. scorpion.

611
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:11,157
Shang tsung has the numbers.

612
00:54:11,373 --> 00:54:13,910
He has that... monster.

613
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:18,039
Go. Hide in the jungle until it is over.

614
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:20,287
And let earth be destroyed?

615
00:54:20,466 --> 00:54:22,832
Sorry, pal. I took an oath to defend it

616
00:54:22,968 --> 00:54:24,174
no matter the odds.

617
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,925
He would not understand, Sonya.

618
00:54:26,013 --> 00:54:27,423
Someone such as him

619
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:29,763
has never known
anything worth dying for.

620
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:33,891
You cannot survive.

621
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:35,677
My will is strong.

622
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,139
My destiny is my own.

623
00:54:40,694 --> 00:54:43,310
You are as naive
as you are doomed.

624
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,772
I've waited here too long.

625
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,319
Know that the next time we meet,

626
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,784
it will not end well.

627
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,197
Well, that was cheery.

628
00:54:54,333 --> 00:54:55,539
Shut up, Botox.

629
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:58,374
I'm just sayin',
he really killed the vibe around here.

630
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,043
I was just...

631
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,413
Shutting up. Yeah. Yeah.

632
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:05,298
Scorpion was right about one thing.

633
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:06,796
We've rested long enough.

634
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:08,339
We must continue on.

635
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,685
I've found them.

636
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:27,692
So, we're here. Now what?

637
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:36,660
Oh. Great. This is fair.

638
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,911
The rules state that
it must be single combat.

639
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,334
These lads aren't here
for the tournament.

640
00:55:41,505 --> 00:55:43,120
They've been paid to kill you.

641
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,465
Hello, love.

642
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,915
Nice to see you again.

643
00:55:48,512 --> 00:55:51,049
Why don't you come over here
and I'll give you a hug.

644
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:53,297
Well, you'd do a better job than Jax.

645
00:55:59,106 --> 00:56:00,642
I guess Raiden was wrong.

646
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:01,774
Oh. Ya think?

647
00:56:01,817 --> 00:56:04,650
No. Stay together.
We'll survive. We have to.

648
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:06,272
Yeah. We better.

649
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,399
I need to make it home
so I can kill my agent.

650
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,288
Be ready.

651
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,458
For what?

652
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,619
You see? I knew he liked us.

653
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:12,626
Stay down!

654
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,006
I know how to fight.

655
00:57:20,729 --> 00:57:21,844
Sure you do.

656
00:57:21,939 --> 00:57:23,520
Just stay down.

657
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,271
Oh, man, is she hot.

658
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,337
Down!

659
00:58:35,012 --> 00:58:36,012
Yeah!

660
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:39,720
Huh? What gives?

661
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,091
You dishonor this tournament.

662
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,651
You will die for what you did.

663
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,735
That's for my clan!

664
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,862
This is for my wife!

665
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,956
And this is for my son!

666
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:12,847
Screw it.

667
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:14,558
He's not paying me enough for this.

668
01:00:14,653 --> 01:00:15,653
Kano!

669
01:00:17,197 --> 01:00:18,653
Go. Save your partner.

670
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:19,990
Sonya!

671
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:21,944
Partner?

672
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,242
Raiden said your destiny would be clear.

673
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,740
So, there she is.

674
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:27,662
You know what?

675
01:00:27,749 --> 01:00:30,115
I guess I don't mind
having my balls crushed.

676
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,204
By her, I mean.

677
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,577
Doesn't make it any better.

678
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,223
I'm disappointed.

679
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,022
I brought you here for one purpose

680
01:00:55,527 --> 01:00:57,768
and you have failed me.

681
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:00,858
You're as weak as your wife was.

682
01:01:01,408 --> 01:01:03,273
As your child.

683
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,359
Yes, you fool.

684
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:09,070
It wasn't sub-zero at all.

685
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,865
I killed them.

686
01:01:12,294 --> 01:01:13,579
It was easy.

687
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:16,670
I used sorcery to hide my identity.

688
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:20,711
To make the lin kueil do as I wanted.

689
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,466
You are strong, scorpion,

690
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,048
but not immortal.

691
01:01:28,143 --> 01:01:29,929
I think I'll leave you here.

692
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:32,844
Just like I left your son.

693
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:45,114
Papa.
The scorpion! It needs help.

694
01:01:45,202 --> 01:01:47,739
Do you know
why the scorpion is feared?

695
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:49,661
Its will.

696
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,833
Come on, Sonya, darling.

697
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:04,459
Just a bit further.

698
01:02:05,263 --> 01:02:06,263
Jax!

699
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:07,674
Sonya?

700
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,297
I'm so glad you made it.

701
01:02:09,893 --> 01:02:11,224
It's gonna be a joy

702
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:13,552
to watch you end up like your partner.

703
01:02:20,654 --> 01:02:22,485
You think I'm afraid of you?

704
01:02:22,614 --> 01:02:24,104
Bring it on!

705
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,589
Oh, fuck.

706
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:49,758
Shang tsung!

707
01:02:51,142 --> 01:02:53,133
Ah. I'm impressed, Raiden.

708
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,101
You were right.

709
01:02:55,355 --> 01:02:56,970
He has great spirit.

710
01:02:57,232 --> 01:02:59,314
And even greater skill.

711
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,811
Please. We both know
yours is a lost cause.

712
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,566
Goro!

713
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:18,958
I'll make you a deal, liu kang.

714
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:22,792
Yield, and shao kahn
will Grant you mercy.

715
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,793
You can come to outworld.

716
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:26,336
Live as a king.

717
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:29,340
We shall show you every pleasure.

718
01:03:29,556 --> 01:03:32,764
Is that how shao kahn
got you to betray your world?

719
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:35,183
I am not as weak as you, shang tsung.

720
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:38,888
Then you shall die. Fight!

721
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,327
Poor Raiden.

722
01:04:02,589 --> 01:04:07,003
It must be awful to watch
your beloved chosen one die

723
01:04:07,135 --> 01:04:10,002
and be unable to do anything about it.

724
01:04:10,305 --> 01:04:12,591
The fight is not over yet.

725
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,134
It may as well be.

726
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,965
Quan chi, goblets.

727
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:19,636
Let us toast to
our emperor's impending victory.

728
01:04:19,731 --> 01:04:21,392
Splendid idea.

729
01:04:30,075 --> 01:04:31,395
Come now, liu kang.

730
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,237
You can do better than that.

731
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:36,820
For outworld.

732
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:38,871
For shao kahn.

733
01:04:47,675 --> 01:04:50,758
Now, finish her!

734
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,100
Here's Johnny!

735
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:06,774
Johnny?

736
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,068
Don't worry, babe. I got this.

737
01:05:14,494 --> 01:05:15,779
All right, boys.

738
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:17,861
Picture's up. Roll sound.

739
01:05:19,749 --> 01:05:21,705
And... action.

740
01:05:36,224 --> 01:05:37,555
Impossible!

741
01:05:37,809 --> 01:05:39,674
Holy shit.

742
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,809
Johnny cage can fight.

743
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,977
Save some for me.

744
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,725
I told you you'd come around.

745
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:50,070
Ugh.

746
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:33,152
Well done.

747
01:06:33,490 --> 01:06:35,947
Truly, I underestimated you.

748
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,775
But I am bored now.

749
01:06:39,204 --> 01:06:41,695
Goro. Playtime is over.

750
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:07,929
Kano!

751
01:07:08,233 --> 01:07:09,233
Stay back!

752
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,065
I'll slit his throat.

753
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,055
Wait a minute.

754
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,766
Now we can go.

755
01:08:11,129 --> 01:08:13,711
Yes. Yes!

756
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,371
You see, quan chi,

757
01:08:15,592 --> 01:08:16,672
the key to winning

758
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:20,293
is always being
a few steps ahead of your enemies.

759
01:08:25,518 --> 01:08:26,928
Did you think I didn't know

760
01:08:27,020 --> 01:08:29,261
you'd betray your emperor, quan chi?

761
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:30,724
You're mistaken.

762
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:31,815
I would never...

763
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,191
All for what? This?

764
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:43,366
He's been imprisoned
for a reason, quan chi.

765
01:08:43,870 --> 01:08:47,078
Your sad devotion to the mad god shinnok

766
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,492
makes you as pathetic as he is.

767
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:53,035
Soon, earthrealm will be shao kahn's,

768
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,745
and his destiny will be complete.

769
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,624
It's too bad
you won't live long enough to see it.

770
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,168
Finish him.

771
01:09:11,773 --> 01:09:13,513
Does it hurt?

772
01:09:24,494 --> 01:09:28,703
Soon, your weak species will be no more.

773
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,682
Who dares?

774
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:54,731
Scorpion.

775
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,600
Impossible.

776
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,984
It would seem I underestimated
your champion, quan chi.

777
01:10:04,450 --> 01:10:07,112
You are scorpion of netherrealm, yes?

778
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,036
You have killed goro.

779
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:15,875
Thus, you must take your rightful place
as the champion of outworld.

780
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:18,915
I want nothing
to do with your game.

781
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,209
I've come for him.

782
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:25,092
Interesting.

783
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,466
Defeat liu kang

784
01:10:27,682 --> 01:10:30,845
and you can have quan chi
to do with as you wish.

785
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:32,971
Defeat liu kang,

786
01:10:33,062 --> 01:10:36,850
and my emperor will give you
all that you dream of.

787
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,357
Vengeance is not the way, scorpion.

788
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,855
Of course it is.

789
01:10:41,988 --> 01:10:43,398
And it's yours.

790
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:45,813
All you have to do

791
01:10:46,409 --> 01:10:47,774
1s kill him.

792
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:08,003
Good. Good.

793
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,882
What choice did he really have,
lord Raiden?

794
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,764
There's always another choice.

795
01:11:22,069 --> 01:11:24,060
Now, fight!

796
01:11:30,661 --> 01:11:33,027
What are you doing?

797
01:11:33,456 --> 01:11:35,162
Living for the future.

798
01:11:35,625 --> 01:11:37,456
Give me the key.

799
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,627
You fool!

800
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:44,839
Shao kahn will hear about this
and kill you.

801
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:46,548
I'm already dead.

802
01:11:46,636 --> 01:11:48,843
Liu kang, I yield.

803
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:49,971
Nol

804
01:11:51,474 --> 01:11:53,465
then the tournament is finished.

805
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,099
Outworld has lost.

806
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:57,560
Earthrealm is safe.

807
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,182
I will kill you all.

808
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:04,900
The tournament is over, shang tsung.

809
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:09,196
I am no longer bound by rules
of non-interference.

810
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,441
Return to your emperor.

811
01:12:11,577 --> 01:12:13,317
Tell him of your failure.

812
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:16,036
You have made a mistake, lord Raiden.

813
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:19,916
Emperor shao kahn will have his revenge.

814
01:12:20,127 --> 01:12:21,333
I'm counting on it.

815
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:23,338
No.

816
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:28,007
Without shang tsung's power,

817
01:12:28,094 --> 01:12:29,425
the island will collapse.

818
01:12:29,512 --> 01:12:31,252
We must go.

819
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,425
What about scorpion?

820
01:12:33,558 --> 01:12:35,423
His path lies elsewhere.

821
01:12:35,518 --> 01:12:36,724
- But...
- Now!

822
01:12:39,063 --> 01:12:41,099
I knew you would survive.

823
01:12:41,274 --> 01:12:43,560
I chose you for a reason.

824
01:12:43,818 --> 01:12:45,433
Give me the key

825
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:49,313
and we can leave this place
before it is destroyed.

826
01:12:49,657 --> 01:12:50,863
Come take it.

827
01:12:51,075 --> 01:12:52,986
Like you did my family.

828
01:12:54,704 --> 01:12:56,410
Very well.

829
01:12:56,497 --> 01:12:57,497
But, please,

830
01:12:57,582 --> 01:13:01,245
put up more of a fight
than your wife did.

831
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:26,266
I'm going to finish the job
my demons couldn't.

832
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:30,236
Die, you wretched vermin!

833
01:13:38,623 --> 01:13:40,614
It's time to die.

834
01:13:41,626 --> 01:13:43,366
Indeed.

835
01:14:01,354 --> 01:14:03,185
Liu! Lord Randy!

836
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:04,478
Need a lift?

837
01:15:20,641 --> 01:15:22,222
Get over here!

838
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:31,102
My god will avenge me.

839
01:15:31,819 --> 01:15:33,980
Damn your god.

840
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:17,103
So... is that it? Did we win?

841
01:16:17,198 --> 01:16:18,198
For now.

842
01:16:18,240 --> 01:16:20,526
All right! Yeah!

843
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,200
Uh, may I?

844
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:29,161
All right! Yeah! Mmm.

845
01:16:30,461 --> 01:16:31,576
Cinnamon.

846
01:16:32,338 --> 01:16:33,953
Mmm. Yeah. Pat me there.

847
01:16:34,048 --> 01:16:35,400
Doesn't mean I'm gonna break the hug.

848
01:16:35,424 --> 01:16:36,709
- That's enough.
- Okay.

849
01:16:38,052 --> 01:16:39,417
Think she'll ever like me?

850
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,343
She didn't hit you in the nuts, did she?

851
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:43,212
Yes, she did, Jax.

852
01:16:43,516 --> 01:16:45,347
Yes, she did.

853
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,307
I have failed you.

854
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:49,434
I could not defeat goro.

855
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,595
If it wasn't for scorpion...

856
01:16:51,774 --> 01:16:53,685
Failed? No.

857
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:57,485
Your destiny was never
to defeat goro, liu kang.

858
01:16:58,155 --> 01:17:00,942
It was to defeat shao kahn.

859
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:04,909
You have failed me.

860
01:17:05,412 --> 01:17:06,902
I'm sorry, master.

861
01:17:07,289 --> 01:17:09,405
It was that old fool, Raiden.

862
01:17:09,667 --> 01:17:10,998
- He...
- Silence!

863
01:17:11,752 --> 01:17:13,583
Gather our forces.

864
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:17,251
It's time to end this game

865
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,752
once and for all.

866
01:17:20,305 --> 01:18:20,520
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
