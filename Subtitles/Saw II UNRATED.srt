1
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,126
Help!

2
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:37,430
Anyone?

3
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:38,993
Help!

4
00:01:58,424 --> 00:01:59,948
<i>Hello, Michael.</i>

5
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:02,326
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

6
00:02:03,696 --> 00:02:07,029
<i>So far,
in what could loosely be called your life,</i>

7
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:09,693
<i>you've made a living watching others.</i>

8
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,200
<i>Society would call you an informant,
a rat, a snitch.</i>

9
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:18,974
<i>I call you unworthy
of the body you possess,</i>

10
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:21,535
<i>of the life that you've been given.</i>

11
00:02:21,914 --> 00:02:25,475
<i>Now we will see
if you are willing to look inward</i>

12
00:02:25,551 --> 00:02:26,916
<i>rather than outward,</i>

13
00:02:26,986 --> 00:02:31,423
<i>to give up the one thing you rely on
in order to go on living.</i>

14
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,121
<i>The device around your neck
is a death mask.</i>

15
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:37,394
<i>The mask is on a spring timer.</i>

16
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:40,091
<i>If you do not locate the key in time,</i>

17
00:02:40,165 --> 00:02:42,497
<i>the mask will close.</i>

18
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:46,300
<i>Think of it like a Venus flytrap.</i>

19
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,976
<i>What you are looking at right now
is your own body</i>

20
00:02:52,044 --> 00:02:54,945
<i>- not more than two hours ago.
- Oh, fuck.</i>

21
00:02:55,014 --> 00:02:59,508
<i>Don't worry.
You're sound asleep and can't feel a thing.</i>

22
00:02:59,585 --> 00:03:03,077
<i>Taking into account
that you are at a great disadvantage here,</i>

23
00:03:03,155 --> 00:03:06,386
<i>I am going to give you a hint
as to where I've hidden the key.</i>

24
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,823
<i>So listen carefully.</i>

25
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,554
<i>The hint is this.</i>

26
00:03:11,063 --> 00:03:13,224
<i>It's right before your eyes.</i>

27
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,894
<i>How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Michael?</i>

28
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:19,437
<i>Live or die.</i>

29
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,036
<i>Make your choice.</i>

30
00:03:21,106 --> 00:03:22,937
Who the fuck are you?
Who the fuck are you?

31
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,805
Who the fuck are you?

32
00:03:26,545 --> 00:03:29,070
Fuck! No!

33
00:03:54,773 --> 00:03:56,001
No!

34
00:03:57,209 --> 00:03:58,972
Someone help me!

35
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,513
Oh, fuck!

36
00:04:07,653 --> 00:04:09,018
<i>Do it.</i>

37
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:12,682
Oh, fuck!

38
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,363
Help me!

39
00:04:22,768 --> 00:04:24,702
Help me! Please!

40
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:26,567
Fuck! What the fuck?

41
00:04:26,638 --> 00:04:27,832
Please!

42
00:04:31,343 --> 00:04:34,335
No, no, no, no, no, no!

43
00:05:02,141 --> 00:05:04,075
- Excuse me.
- Help you?

44
00:05:04,143 --> 00:05:06,338
I'm here for Daniel Matthews.

45
00:05:10,182 --> 00:05:11,547
Sign these.

46
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:20,385
Thanks. Let's go, Daniel.

47
00:05:23,562 --> 00:05:24,961
Took you long enough.

48
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,863
I'm sorry I didn't have it penciled in
on my schedule.

49
00:05:29,802 --> 00:05:32,635
- They're gonna press charges, you know.
- Yeah. They're assholes.

50
00:05:32,704 --> 00:05:35,434
Of course they are. You stole from them.

51
00:05:36,708 --> 00:05:38,767
This works out great for me, though.

52
00:05:38,844 --> 00:05:42,837
Your mother gets to keep custody.
I get to take you into custody.

53
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,483
What is it with you?

54
00:05:48,654 --> 00:05:50,622
What, are you a tough guy
'cause you steal now?

55
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:53,157
Please, save me the after-school special.

56
00:05:53,225 --> 00:05:56,160
- Why are you such a cop 24/7?
- Hey, it's called being a father.

57
00:05:56,228 --> 00:05:58,924
Trust me, you're better at being a cop.

58
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:02,999
I just think
I should go back to Mom's early.

59
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,059
- What did you say?
- What, can you not hear me?

60
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:07,264
No, I can't hear you. Say it again.

61
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,706
- I think I should go back to Mom's...
- Well, then, go!

62
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,371
Jesus.

63
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:26,420
<i>Hey, it's Daniel. Leave a message.</i>

64
00:06:26,492 --> 00:06:28,858
<i>It's Dad. Sorry about yesterday.</i>

65
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:33,088
Look, I haven't heard from you.
Would you give me a call, please?

66
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,803
Daniel.

67
00:06:45,244 --> 00:06:48,179
Oh, sorry, Sarge.
I thought you were my son.

68
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,449
Yeah. I'll be right there.

69
00:06:56,355 --> 00:06:57,515
What do you got?

70
00:06:57,589 --> 00:07:00,217
County asbestos cleaners
were working on a deadline.

71
00:07:00,292 --> 00:07:02,283
One of them finds a body, calls it in.

72
00:07:02,361 --> 00:07:06,297
Says that this whole section's
been abandoned for two years.

73
00:07:06,365 --> 00:07:07,957
We've spotted people down here, though.

74
00:07:08,033 --> 00:07:10,263
- Who?
- Well, homeless, mostly.

75
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,463
Bunch of kids held a rave
in the boiler room about two months back.

76
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:16,531
- Get an estimate on the time of death?
- Forensics just got here.

77
00:07:16,608 --> 00:07:19,338
But it was the arriving officer
who called it in as your buddy.

78
00:07:19,411 --> 00:07:21,379
He wasn't my buddy. He was an informant.

79
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:23,414
This officer IDed him
just by looking at him?

80
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:25,609
Well, he wasn't positive.

81
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:27,914
- That's why I wanted you here.
- All right.

82
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:31,717
Well, let me get a look at his face.
I'll tell you in two seconds if it's him or not.

83
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:33,815
Therein lies the problem.

84
00:07:55,213 --> 00:07:56,874
Yeah, it's Mike.

85
00:08:12,531 --> 00:08:14,624
When were you gonna tell me about that?

86
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,191
Thought you'd wanna see it for yourself.

87
00:08:18,103 --> 00:08:19,968
Okay. Well, I saw it.

88
00:08:20,272 --> 00:08:22,365
All right, look. I mean, it's a little early,

89
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:24,966
but so far
everything matches Jigsaw's pattern.

90
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,544
I can see that. What do you want with me?

91
00:08:27,613 --> 00:08:30,741
All right, let's just pretend for a second
that this is new to us, all right?

92
00:08:30,816 --> 00:08:33,080
Can you think of anyone
that would wanna do this to your guy?

93
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,177
Well, he's an informant, Kerry.
You want a list of possible suspects?

94
00:08:36,254 --> 00:08:37,619
Grab a phone book.

95
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,249
Crackhead county punks
don't have engineering degrees.

96
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:44,056
Now, I'd say that our cause of death here
narrows that list down just a little bit,

97
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:45,619
wouldn't you?

98
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,590
Sure. And you're the expert.

99
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:53,703
Look closer, Detective Matthews.

100
00:08:56,608 --> 00:08:57,836
At what?

101
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,441
Ask whoever wrote it.

102
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,924
<i>Hello, Michael.</i>

103
00:09:15,994 --> 00:09:17,894
<i>I want to play a game.</i>

104
00:09:20,065 --> 00:09:23,296
<i>So far,
in what could loosely be called your life,</i>

105
00:09:23,368 --> 00:09:26,030
<i>you've made a living watching others.</i>

106
00:09:26,638 --> 00:09:28,731
You know, you and that guy
have a lot in common, Kerry.

107
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,069
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

108
00:09:30,142 --> 00:09:32,838
- You both like playing games with people.
- Excuse me?

109
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,311
Don't ever pull some shit like that again
on me at a crime scene.

110
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:39,214
- Look, I'm not the one taunting you. He is.
- Doesn't mean I have to take the bait.

111
00:09:41,386 --> 00:09:44,719
- Besides, I got a full caseload as it is.
- A bunch of desk errands and shit work.

112
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:46,815
Yeah, well, between that,
IA breathing down my neck,

113
00:09:46,892 --> 00:09:48,120
my son's budding criminal career

114
00:09:48,193 --> 00:09:49,660
and my wife's fucking divorce lawyers,

115
00:09:49,728 --> 00:09:52,196
I'd say my hands are pretty full,
wouldn't you?

116
00:09:52,264 --> 00:09:54,528
Yeah. Look, I'm sorry.

117
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:58,091
I was hoping, maybe,
that I could bring you in on this one.

118
00:09:58,203 --> 00:09:59,500
We're not partners anymore, Kerry.

119
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:00,765
Hey, forget that we're not partners.

120
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:03,535
What about the fact that this guy wrote
your fucking name on the wall, huh?

121
00:10:03,608 --> 00:10:04,666
He asked for you.

122
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:07,906
It's not the first time
some psychopath called me out.

123
00:10:07,979 --> 00:10:10,641
All right.
What about the fact that I'm asking?

124
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:19,284
Can't help you.

125
00:10:19,357 --> 00:10:21,655
- Wow.
- You're the Jigsaw expert.

126
00:10:23,495 --> 00:10:25,725
When did you stop being a cop?

127
00:10:31,169 --> 00:10:33,637
<i>Look closer, Detective Matthews.</i>

128
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,108
<i>This guy wrote your fucking name
on the wall.</i>

129
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,344
<i>Look closer, Detective Matthews.</i>

130
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:47,343
<i>He asked for you.</i>

131
00:10:47,419 --> 00:10:48,977
<i>All right, fellas. Listen up.</i>

132
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,950
These are the best entry points.

133
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:57,354
They're the ones with direct street frontage,
vehicle access and good cover.

134
00:10:57,896 --> 00:11:00,296
Now, remember,
we're doing this in broad daylight.

135
00:11:00,365 --> 00:11:01,730
We don't wanna scare any civilians.

136
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,597
<i>Look, I've been there before.
I know the location.</i>

137
00:11:03,668 --> 00:11:05,727
Let's just bust in there
and scare the shit out of anyone

138
00:11:05,804 --> 00:11:07,032
<i>who happens to be inside, okay?</i>

139
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:08,629
<i>We're going in teams of three.</i>

140
00:11:09,141 --> 00:11:11,701
I'll go with Team Alpha.

141
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,009
Just like the good old days, huh?

142
00:11:23,922 --> 00:11:26,516
I thought your caseload
was big enough as it is.

143
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,990
I'm just tagging along for the ride.

144
00:11:34,065 --> 00:11:35,657
Go, go, go, go, go.

145
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,102
Check the back. Secure the back.

146
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,742
- Go around.
- I got it, I got it.

147
00:11:50,816 --> 00:11:53,785
Alpha Team, I want you in front.
Baker, flank the side.

148
00:11:53,852 --> 00:11:55,376
All right, let's do this.

149
00:11:57,289 --> 00:12:01,521
Go, go, go.

150
00:12:01,593 --> 00:12:03,584
Keep moving, keep moving.

151
00:12:56,281 --> 00:12:57,509
Freeze!

152
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,274
What the fuck?

153
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,301
Officer down! Officer down!

154
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,768
<i>The fucking place is wired!</i>

155
00:13:18,837 --> 00:13:20,964
Officer down! Officer down!

156
00:13:23,408 --> 00:13:25,399
Fuck this! Baker Team, get in here now!

157
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:27,536
<i>- All right, go, go! Go!
- Baker Team, get in now!</i>

158
00:13:36,288 --> 00:13:37,448
Guys.

159
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:41,319
Talk to me, guys.

160
00:13:46,965 --> 00:13:48,262
Go. Go.

161
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:51,334
Officer down. Okay.

162
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:53,064
Stand back.

163
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:54,799
Move him out. Move him out.

164
00:13:54,873 --> 00:13:56,670
Clear. Clear.

165
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,435
Stand back.

166
00:14:01,746 --> 00:14:03,043
Move out!

167
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:08,813
Repeat.

168
00:14:12,724 --> 00:14:14,453
Freeze! Don't move!

169
00:14:15,927 --> 00:14:18,452
Let me see your hands.
I'm not gonna ask again.

170
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,930
Put your hands where I can see them.

171
00:14:20,999 --> 00:14:22,762
Down on your knees!

172
00:14:24,469 --> 00:14:27,927
- Down on your knees!
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

173
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:37,473
Get him in restraints now.

174
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:49,792
You have the right to remain silent.
You have the right to an attorney.

175
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:53,388
If you can't afford one,
one will be appointed to you by the City.

176
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,898
He's clean.

177
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:03,565
Hey.

178
00:15:05,744 --> 00:15:07,575
Is this close enough?

179
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,250
Get his ass out of here.

180
00:15:15,954 --> 00:15:18,286
Actually, I will need to remain here

181
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:21,757
while you deal with your problem,
Detective Matthews.

182
00:15:24,662 --> 00:15:27,927
- What problem?
- The problem in that room.

183
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,172
You keep him secure.

184
00:16:16,347 --> 00:16:17,541
Clear.

185
00:16:34,332 --> 00:16:35,594
Shit.

186
00:16:36,734 --> 00:16:38,827
- What?
- I don't know.

187
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:47,339
Shit.

188
00:16:48,346 --> 00:16:50,211
I think that's my son.

189
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,213
Fuck.

190
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,581
He's got my son.

191
00:17:01,926 --> 00:17:03,791
What the fuck is that?

192
00:17:04,562 --> 00:17:06,757
Hey! Hey! What the fuck is that?

193
00:17:06,831 --> 00:17:08,799
It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?

194
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,334
I know who he is, you piece of shit.

195
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,993
What is he doing on that fucking monitor?

196
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,300
Well, I haven't looked at the monitors
for some time,

197
00:17:14,372 --> 00:17:15,999
so it would be hard for me to say,

198
00:17:16,074 --> 00:17:19,635
but I would imagine
that he's cowering in a corner

199
00:17:19,711 --> 00:17:20,939
with a look on his face...

200
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:22,775
- You motherfucker!
- No, Eric. Wait.

201
00:17:22,847 --> 00:17:25,338
You motherfucker!
Where is he? Where is he?

202
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:26,542
Where is he?

203
00:17:26,618 --> 00:17:29,587
That's a problem you're gonna
have to solve before it's too late.

204
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:31,884
He has about two hours

205
00:17:32,357 --> 00:17:34,791
before the gas
creeping into his nervous system

206
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:36,986
begins to break down his body tissue

207
00:17:37,061 --> 00:17:40,224
and he begins to bleed
from every orifice he has.

208
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:44,828
Oh, yes. There will be blood.

209
00:17:47,372 --> 00:17:49,135
Tell me where he is.

210
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,838
He's in a safe place.

211
00:18:04,522 --> 00:18:06,990
- Eric.
- I need a phone.

212
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:10,928
- Eric, just listen to me for a second.
- Just give me a phone!

213
00:18:15,466 --> 00:18:19,493
- Look, everything about this fits his profile.
- I need to be sure.

214
00:18:19,571 --> 00:18:23,302
<i>You've reached Daniel's phone.
He's not in right now, but if you'd leave...</i>

215
00:18:26,811 --> 00:18:28,142
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:28,379 --> 00:18:30,847
We have something
counting down over here.

217
00:18:30,915 --> 00:18:32,815
Get me bomb squad, now.

218
00:18:51,236 --> 00:18:52,294
Hey.

219
00:18:53,738 --> 00:18:55,262
Hey, wake up.

220
00:18:56,674 --> 00:18:57,732
Hey.

221
00:19:00,144 --> 00:19:01,736
Can you hear me?

222
00:19:06,384 --> 00:19:08,249
She's still breathing.

223
00:19:12,624 --> 00:19:14,751
What is this, house arrest?

224
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,586
- Are we in jail?
- No.

225
00:19:17,028 --> 00:19:20,395
- This ain't jail, man.
- Oh, yeah? You done a lot of time?

226
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:23,098
Yeah. Too much.

227
00:19:24,402 --> 00:19:28,566
- Somebody open the fucking door!
- I don't think anybody's listening.

228
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,274
Damn. What the fuck is this?

229
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:33,207
Somebody's listening.

230
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:36,237
No.

231
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:40,746
Those types of cameras don't have sound.

232
00:19:42,053 --> 00:19:43,213
Fuck!

233
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:46,516
Fuck!

234
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:50,718
How do you just wake up in a room
and have no idea where you are?

235
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,319
I guess you never been drunk before.

236
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:54,365
I've been drunk.
I spent three years at college drunk.

237
00:19:54,432 --> 00:19:57,026
This isn't drunk. This is kidnapping.

238
00:20:02,073 --> 00:20:05,804
Look, I saw this movie on TV last week.

239
00:20:05,877 --> 00:20:08,971
This guy, he was a reporter,
and he goes into this war zone, right?

240
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:11,106
He goes in to sleep in his hotel room
the first night.

241
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:15,915
Bam! He wakes up the next morning,
he's in a cell with no windows and no light.

242
00:20:15,987 --> 00:20:19,218
And he spent nine years in that room.

243
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:24,526
Nine years?
Man, that's nothing. Get over it.

244
00:20:24,595 --> 00:20:25,857
What do you mean, "get over it"?

245
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:27,830
I mean, stop bitching about it
and let's do something.

246
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:30,834
- I think we should all just calm down.
- Shut up! Shut up!

247
00:20:30,902 --> 00:20:32,529
I hear something.

248
00:20:34,005 --> 00:20:35,632
What is it?

249
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,338
It's ticking. I hear ticking.

250
00:21:00,898 --> 00:21:04,334
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down. Calm down.
What's your name?

251
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:06,434
Amanda.

252
00:21:07,805 --> 00:21:09,898
- Where am I?
- I don't know.

253
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:12,704
Nobody knows.
We all just woke up here like you.

254
00:21:15,646 --> 00:21:17,045
No!

255
00:21:18,015 --> 00:21:19,175
No!

256
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,108
- No!
- No, it's okay.

257
00:21:21,185 --> 00:21:22,447
No!

258
00:21:27,558 --> 00:21:28,650
- What?
- Fuck!

259
00:21:29,327 --> 00:21:30,453
What?

260
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:40,427
What are you looking for?

261
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:04,060
What is this?

262
00:22:04,562 --> 00:22:07,292
Everything you need to know is on this.

263
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:11,758
<i>Greetings and welcome.</i>

264
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:15,101
<i>I trust that you are all wondering
where you are.</i>

265
00:22:15,173 --> 00:22:18,870
<i>I can assure you
that while your location is not important,</i>

266
00:22:18,943 --> 00:22:22,709
<i>what these walls offer for you is important.</i>

267
00:22:23,247 --> 00:22:25,841
<i>Salvation, if you earn it.</i>

268
00:22:26,417 --> 00:22:29,853
<i>Three hours from now,
the door to this house will open.</i>

269
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:34,154
<i>Unfortunately,
you only have two hours to live.</i>

270
00:22:34,892 --> 00:22:38,726
<i>Right now,
you are breathing in a deadly nerve agent.</i>

271
00:22:38,896 --> 00:22:41,797
<i>You've been breathing it
since you arrived here.</i>

272
00:22:41,866 --> 00:22:44,801
<i>Those of you
familiar with the Tokyo subway attacks</i>

273
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:48,498
<i>will know its devastating effects
on the human body.</i>

274
00:22:48,573 --> 00:22:52,065
<i>The only way to overcome it
and walk out that door</i>

275
00:22:52,143 --> 00:22:54,077
<i>is to find an antidote.</i>

276
00:22:54,412 --> 00:22:57,040
<i>Several are hidden around this house.</i>

277
00:22:57,715 --> 00:23:00,445
<i>One is inside the safe in front of you.</i>

278
00:23:00,852 --> 00:23:03,787
<i>You all possess
the combination to the safe.</i>

279
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:08,683
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

280
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:13,059
<i>The clue to their order can be found
over the rainbow.</i>

281
00:23:13,598 --> 00:23:16,499
<i>Once you realize
what you all have in common,</i>

282
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:20,128
<i>you will gain a better understanding
of why you're here.</i>

283
00:23:20,605 --> 00:23:24,097
<i>"X" marks the spot for that clue,
so look carefully.</i>

284
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:26,371
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

285
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:31,411
- Who is this?
- What does he mean, gas?

286
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:35,213
- And how did you know where to find this?
- This is bullshit.

287
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:42,152
"Do not attempt to use this key
on the door to this room. "

288
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:44,017
Fuck this, man.

289
00:23:44,495 --> 00:23:47,157
- Yeah, fuck this. That's a good idea.
- No, no.

290
00:23:47,231 --> 00:23:49,825
- That's not a good idea.
- So what are we gonna do, huh?

291
00:23:49,901 --> 00:23:52,495
- Sit here?
- The note said not to use the key.

292
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:54,571
Who gives a shit about the note, all right?

293
00:23:54,639 --> 00:23:58,598
This is all a fucking big goddamn joke,
and I'm about to end it.

294
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:19,921
You better start talking right now.

295
00:24:20,164 --> 00:24:22,098
- What is this?
- It's a game.

296
00:24:22,166 --> 00:24:25,101
It ain't no fucking game!
My man just got his head blown off.

297
00:24:25,169 --> 00:24:27,660
- He's testing us.
- Who's testing us?

298
00:24:27,738 --> 00:24:28,727
Jigsaw.

299
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:32,435
- Who the hell is Jigsaw?
- You don't watch the fucking news?

300
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:35,104
- No. Who is he?
- He's a serial killer.

301
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:38,112
No, he's not.

302
00:24:38,182 --> 00:24:40,946
He's testing us. He wants us to survive this.

303
00:24:41,018 --> 00:24:43,919
But you have to play by the fucking rules!

304
00:24:47,725 --> 00:24:50,956
I'm gonna ask you again.
How do you know all this?

305
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,459
Because I've played before.

306
00:25:14,285 --> 00:25:18,381
I want a tech team in here now.
Find out where that feed is coming from.

307
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,589
What do you want with me?

308
00:25:29,767 --> 00:25:32,895
- A little of your time, Detective.
- I don't have any time.

309
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,530
You asked me what I wanted,
and I told you.

310
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:39,337
Believe me when I tell you
your son is in a lot of trouble.

311
00:25:43,881 --> 00:25:46,372
And what if I give you
a little bit of my time? What then?

312
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:48,918
I only wanna talk to you.
Everyone else must leave.

313
00:25:48,986 --> 00:25:52,149
- Those are my conditions.
- No. It's a crime scene. Nobody leaves.

314
00:25:52,223 --> 00:25:53,588
They don't have to leave the building.

315
00:25:53,658 --> 00:25:57,424
They just have to leave this area
long enough for me to talk to you.

316
00:25:57,495 --> 00:26:00,987
If you agree to that,
then you will see your son again.

317
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:07,129
If I don't see my son again, I swear to God
I'll rip your fucking head off.

318
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:13,275
I don't intend to mock you, Officer,
but I'm a cancer patient.

319
00:26:13,577 --> 00:26:17,445
How could you possibly put me
in any more pain than I'm already in?

320
00:26:24,355 --> 00:26:26,289
Just get them here now.

321
00:26:26,457 --> 00:26:27,822
All right, tech team's on the way.

322
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:29,951
Should have your signal traced
within an hour, maybe two.

323
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:31,460
He said he wants to talk to me alone.

324
00:26:31,529 --> 00:26:33,463
- Well, maybe you should talk to him.
- Well, fuck that.

325
00:26:33,531 --> 00:26:34,896
Five minutes, old-school method.

326
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:37,331
He's not gonna respond to
the phone-book treatment. You know that.

327
00:26:37,401 --> 00:26:38,868
Don't underestimate
a tried and true method here.

328
00:26:38,936 --> 00:26:40,801
I am the one who has been working
on this case from day one.

329
00:26:40,871 --> 00:26:43,203
I have been spending every waking moment
piecing it together.

330
00:26:43,274 --> 00:26:45,469
Maybe that's why
you ain't got a goddamn family for yourself

331
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:48,671
and you can't understand
what this man is going through.

332
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,675
- Don't.
- Look...

333
00:26:55,753 --> 00:26:57,277
I don't wanna talk to him.

334
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:00,448
Listen, you already lost your son
one time before

335
00:27:00,524 --> 00:27:02,924
because you got involved with me.

336
00:27:04,628 --> 00:27:06,186
It's not gonna happen again.

337
00:27:06,263 --> 00:27:07,924
This is bullshit.

338
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:09,961
What are we gonna do?

339
00:27:10,034 --> 00:27:13,492
Just humor him. Buy us a little more time.

340
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:17,669
You can win this, Eric. You can beat him.

341
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,706
- Come on.
- All right.

342
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,941
<i>...find an antidote.</i>

343
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:28,010
<i>Several are hidden around this house.</i>

344
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:31,215
<i>One is inside the safe in front of you.</i>

345
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:34,916
<i>You all possess
the combination to the safe.</i>

346
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:39,158
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

347
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:45,702
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

348
00:27:45,903 --> 00:27:48,428
<i>The clue to their order can be found...</i>

349
00:28:38,556 --> 00:28:39,648
Shit.

350
00:28:48,432 --> 00:28:50,627
Hey, wait a minute. Where you going?

351
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:53,261
I'm gonna find an antidote,
and I'm gonna get out of here.

352
00:28:53,337 --> 00:28:56,170
What? Antidote? You been in the joint.

353
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,071
You talked to the guards
that run the chambers.

354
00:28:58,142 --> 00:29:00,133
You know there ain't no antidote
for this shit.

355
00:29:00,211 --> 00:29:02,543
Look at this. The doors are locked.

356
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:04,808
You hear that? It's wood.

357
00:29:05,382 --> 00:29:08,715
Plaster. It's not a fortress.
It's a fucking house.

358
00:29:08,786 --> 00:29:12,347
All I'm saying is let's just take our time
and come up with a game plan.

359
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:16,757
Well, you come up with the game plan.
All right? I'm getting out of here.

360
00:29:29,506 --> 00:29:30,598
Look.

361
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:53,558
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

362
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:11,038
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

363
00:30:11,115 --> 00:30:14,175
You don't know
what's behind that fucking door.

364
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,355
Fuck.

365
00:30:21,425 --> 00:30:22,722
Shit.

366
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:36,429
Clear the room.

367
00:30:43,414 --> 00:30:46,542
Okay. Let's talk.

368
00:30:47,785 --> 00:30:49,343
Sit down, Eric.

369
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,264
I want to play a game.

370
00:31:05,336 --> 00:31:06,860
The rules are simple.

371
00:31:06,937 --> 00:31:09,337
All you have to do is sit here
and talk to me,

372
00:31:09,406 --> 00:31:10,873
listen to me.

373
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:14,042
<i>If you do that long enough,
then you will find your son</i>

374
00:31:14,111 --> 00:31:16,204
in a safe and secure state.

375
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:20,076
We haven't been properly introduced.
My name's John.

376
00:31:20,551 --> 00:31:23,577
- I thought you liked to be called Jigsaw.
- No, no.

377
00:31:25,222 --> 00:31:28,521
It was the police and the press
who coined the nickname Jigsaw.

378
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,890
I never encouraged or claimed that.

379
00:31:30,961 --> 00:31:35,557
The jigsaw piece I cut from my subjects
was only ever meant to be a symbol

380
00:31:35,632 --> 00:31:37,896
that that subject was missing something.

381
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:41,802
A vital piece of the human puzzle.
The survival instinct.

382
00:31:42,039 --> 00:31:45,497
This is all really, really interesting, John,

383
00:31:46,844 --> 00:31:49,005
but right now
I'd really like for you to talk to me...

384
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,910
I am talking to you.

385
00:31:51,548 --> 00:31:53,379
You're not listening.

386
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:57,378
- Don't forget the rules.
- I'm listening to you,

387
00:31:58,455 --> 00:32:01,049
but all I'm hearing
is the same sick fucking bullshit

388
00:32:01,125 --> 00:32:03,685
that comes about two seconds
into every interview I've ever done

389
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,251
with one of you fucking people.

390
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:08,389
Well, that's an interesting approach
to police work, isn't it?

391
00:32:08,465 --> 00:32:12,231
Aren't you supposed to be convincing me
that I'm your friend,

392
00:32:12,536 --> 00:32:16,836
lulling me into a false sense of security
so that I'll confide in you?

393
00:32:17,441 --> 00:32:21,741
It's a little hard to follow the manual
when you've got my son, John.

394
00:32:21,812 --> 00:32:23,177
The manual?

395
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:26,709
What do you really wanna do to me
right now, huh?

396
00:32:26,784 --> 00:32:28,581
What would you have done
five years ago, huh?

397
00:32:28,652 --> 00:32:30,847
Would you have followed the manual then?

398
00:32:30,921 --> 00:32:34,015
Would you have broken my jaw
with a flashlight?

399
00:32:34,224 --> 00:32:37,557
You seem to know a whole lot about me.

400
00:32:37,628 --> 00:32:41,257
I know you were once considered
a fearless police officer.

401
00:32:43,934 --> 00:32:47,927
Do you feel a whole lot safer
now that you only sit behind a desk?

402
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:50,337
I feel a whole lot of things right now.

403
00:32:50,407 --> 00:32:53,274
But you feel alive. That's what you feel.

404
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:55,641
And that's the point.

405
00:32:57,381 --> 00:32:58,643
Would you

406
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,148
kindly get me a glass of water?

407
00:33:04,655 --> 00:33:07,123
I would very much appreciate that.

408
00:33:36,753 --> 00:33:38,015
Fuck!

409
00:33:40,157 --> 00:33:41,317
Well, we've established

410
00:33:41,391 --> 00:33:44,690
that the macho-bullshit approach
isn't opening the door.

411
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:47,662
- Any other suggestions?
- Look who's talking.

412
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:51,228
The only door you know how to open
is between your legs.

413
00:33:51,301 --> 00:33:53,292
- Why don't you shut the hell up, all right?
- Come on, man.

414
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,304
- Why don't you shut the hell up?
- I'm sick of your bullshit.

415
00:33:55,372 --> 00:33:57,340
- That's right, back up, bitch!
- You little dickhead.

416
00:33:57,407 --> 00:33:58,396
- Asshole!
- Hey!

417
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,739
What you gonna do?
Yeah, yeah, that's right, back up!

418
00:34:00,811 --> 00:34:03,473
Okay, man. All right.
Nobody take shit from nobody.

419
00:34:03,547 --> 00:34:05,481
We've established that.

420
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:13,781
- Did you find anything?
- No. Nothing.

421
00:34:27,337 --> 00:34:29,999
So, that ink on your arm,
that's Joliet, right?

422
00:34:30,073 --> 00:34:31,836
Yeah. So?

423
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,844
- Well, I did a stretch there myself.
- I'm proud of you.

424
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,113
And you,
what is your correctional facility of choice?

425
00:34:38,182 --> 00:34:39,274
What's your point?

426
00:34:39,349 --> 00:34:42,841
My point is, you didn't get that way
by teaching grade school, right?

427
00:34:43,554 --> 00:34:45,647
That makes three of us that's done time.

428
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:47,587
I think we should be concentrating
on that tape,

429
00:34:47,658 --> 00:34:50,889
'cause that tape said
we have more in common than we know.

430
00:34:50,961 --> 00:34:53,452
I say the three of us doing stretches...

431
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:56,693
Hey! I found a door over here.

432
00:35:12,816 --> 00:35:14,716
I need the flashlight.

433
00:35:53,357 --> 00:35:54,756
Over there.

434
00:35:57,694 --> 00:35:59,321
What the fuck?

435
00:36:10,474 --> 00:36:11,771
Oh, shit!

436
00:36:15,045 --> 00:36:16,103
Hey!

437
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:18,908
- Damn, kid.
- Sorry.

438
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:29,985
- "Obi. "
- What the fuck is a Obi?

439
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,452
Obi. It's my name.

440
00:36:43,907 --> 00:36:46,933
<i>Hello, Obi. I want to play a game.</i>

441
00:36:47,477 --> 00:36:50,139
<i>For years,
you have burned those around you</i>

442
00:36:50,213 --> 00:36:53,410
<i>with your lies, cons and deceits.</i>

443
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:56,744
<i>Now you'll have a chance
to redeem yourself</i>

444
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:59,118
<i>for the games you've played with others</i>

445
00:36:59,189 --> 00:37:01,123
<i>by playing one of mine.</i>

446
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:05,025
<i>Inside the device in front of you
are two antidotes</i>

447
00:37:05,128 --> 00:37:08,154
<i>for the poison
coursing through your veins.</i>

448
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:11,859
<i>One is my gift to you
for helping me kidnap the others.</i>

449
00:37:12,169 --> 00:37:14,797
<i>The second is yours to donate.</i>

450
00:37:14,938 --> 00:37:18,499
<i>However,
one of them will come with a price.</i>

451
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:20,432
<i>Remember, Obi,</i>

452
00:37:21,144 --> 00:37:25,376
<i>once you are in hell,
only the devil can help you out.</i>

453
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,250
Wait a minute.
What does that mean, "kidnap the others"?

454
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:32,311
- How would I know?
- Because you put us here.

455
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:36,950
The car.

456
00:37:37,961 --> 00:37:39,292
It was...

457
00:37:43,633 --> 00:37:45,294
I knew I knew him.

458
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,438
You're the last person I saw
before I woke up here.

459
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,500
You did this.

460
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,047
Are you sure it's him? You better be sure.

461
00:38:00,984 --> 00:38:02,417
I'm sure.

462
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:05,783
You would have done the same.
I did what I had to do.

463
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:07,790
I'll give you a choice.

464
00:38:08,692 --> 00:38:12,628
- You got five seconds to get us out of here.
- I don't know the way out.

465
00:38:13,597 --> 00:38:17,158
Bullshit! You put us in here.
You can get us out of here.

466
00:38:18,702 --> 00:38:20,192
No, I can't.

467
00:38:20,337 --> 00:38:23,101
- Then you're a dead man.
- So are you.

468
00:38:23,173 --> 00:38:26,404
He's not gonna... Wait, wait, wait, wait!
Wait, listen to me.

469
00:38:26,476 --> 00:38:28,774
Okay, we got two antidotes
at the back of that oven.

470
00:38:28,845 --> 00:38:32,713
- We're wasting time here.
- Wasting time? Are you kidding me?

471
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:35,377
He kidnapped me in the middle of the night.

472
00:38:35,452 --> 00:38:37,443
We don't even know
what's in those syringes.

473
00:38:37,521 --> 00:38:40,183
You willing to stick yourself in the arm
to find out?

474
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:43,582
Okay, wait. So who gets them?

475
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,026
I mean, there's two.
So which two people get the antidote?

476
00:38:46,096 --> 00:38:48,121
We'll work that out later!

477
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:54,734
Right now you're going in there

478
00:38:55,972 --> 00:38:58,406
or I'll kill you where you stand.

479
00:39:06,716 --> 00:39:07,876
Shit.

480
00:39:09,085 --> 00:39:13,647
If you're gonna threaten me with a knife,
you may as well cut me a little.

481
00:39:22,199 --> 00:39:24,895
I guess I'm going in there
to get those needles.

482
00:39:24,968 --> 00:39:26,595
But I get one.

483
00:39:58,168 --> 00:40:00,295
- One for me.
- Hurry up.

484
00:40:02,772 --> 00:40:06,572
Come on, baby.
You guys can fight over this one.

485
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:10,804
Thank you, Obi.

486
00:40:11,648 --> 00:40:13,013
Come on.

487
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:16,751
- Oh, shit. The fucking door closed!
- Open the door!

488
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:19,513
Open the door!

489
00:40:21,691 --> 00:40:23,921
It's locked. I can't open it.

490
00:40:24,728 --> 00:40:26,423
Open the door!

491
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:30,825
Open the fucking door! Not funny!

492
00:40:32,068 --> 00:40:33,933
Come on! Get him out of there!

493
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:35,471
The door!

494
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:36,870
The nail!

495
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:39,270
I can't get it open!

496
00:40:41,978 --> 00:40:44,378
- Get him out of there!
- Not funny!

497
00:41:09,606 --> 00:41:12,666
Use your coat! Use your fucking coat!

498
00:41:13,243 --> 00:41:16,576
- Come on! He's burning up!
- Stop it!

499
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,050
- Come on!
- Turn! Turn!

500
00:41:26,189 --> 00:41:27,486
Stop it.

501
00:41:27,557 --> 00:41:29,149
- You gotta put your weight on it.
- Stop it.

502
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:30,214
My man's dying!

503
00:41:33,463 --> 00:41:35,363
Guys, there's a window over here.

504
00:41:36,766 --> 00:41:38,859
- He's got the antidote.
- Stop it!

505
00:41:38,935 --> 00:41:40,334
Get him out.

506
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:44,038
- Hurry!
- Get it open.

507
00:41:44,207 --> 00:41:46,869
- Fuck!
... glass or something.

508
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:49,673
- Stop it!
- Hang on, man. We're gonna get you out.

509
00:41:50,113 --> 00:41:51,137
Shit.

510
00:41:51,514 --> 00:41:56,008
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

511
00:41:56,686 --> 00:42:00,588
Get out of the fucking way!
Go on, move! Move!

512
00:42:03,693 --> 00:42:05,786
Here. Shit! Come on!

513
00:42:39,462 --> 00:42:40,451
The needles!

514
00:42:40,563 --> 00:42:43,225
He ain't got the fucking needles!
It's fucking in there!

515
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:46,325
I want the fucking needles!
I want the fucking needles!

516
00:42:46,403 --> 00:42:47,768
Calm down.

517
00:42:47,937 --> 00:42:50,667
- Fuck!
- The needles are fucking melted.

518
00:42:52,175 --> 00:42:53,665
They're gone.

519
00:42:54,978 --> 00:42:56,570
He had a choice.

520
00:43:00,784 --> 00:43:02,012
Another one down, Kerry.

521
00:43:02,085 --> 00:43:03,882
How much more time are we gonna waste
on this bastard?

522
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:04,977
We're not wasting time.

523
00:43:05,055 --> 00:43:07,819
We're doing exactly what we should be
doing until the tech team gets here.

524
00:43:07,891 --> 00:43:09,153
It's not what it looks like to me.

525
00:43:12,062 --> 00:43:14,656
<i>You see, Detective,
Darwin's theory of evolution</i>

526
00:43:14,731 --> 00:43:17,996
and survival of the fittest,
based on his little trip to the Galápagos,

527
00:43:18,068 --> 00:43:19,729
no longer applies on this planet.

528
00:43:19,803 --> 00:43:22,397
We have a human race
that doesn't have the edge

529
00:43:22,472 --> 00:43:24,804
or the will to survive.

530
00:43:24,874 --> 00:43:28,002
- What the fuck do you want?
- It's hard to remain calm, isn't it,

531
00:43:28,078 --> 00:43:31,241
when your son is walking around
on those monitors?

532
00:43:31,314 --> 00:43:34,806
I can't give you what you want
if you don't tell me what the fuck it is.

533
00:43:34,884 --> 00:43:36,545
I told you what it is.

534
00:43:36,619 --> 00:43:39,747
- Just remember the rules.
- No, you said you wanted to talk.

535
00:43:39,823 --> 00:43:44,055
Then you said you wanted to play a game.
You're talking, but it means nothing!

536
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,152
What do you think
the cure for cancer is, Eric?

537
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,460
- What?
- The cure for cancer.

538
00:43:49,532 --> 00:43:51,932
- What is it?
- I don't know what it is,

539
00:43:52,001 --> 00:43:54,094
but I know
it's not killing and torturing people

540
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,694
for your own sick fucking pleasure.

541
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:59,674
I've never murdered anyone in my life.
The decisions are up to them.

542
00:43:59,743 --> 00:44:01,267
Yeah, well,
putting a gun to someone's head

543
00:44:01,344 --> 00:44:03,369
and forcing them to pull the trigger
is still murder.

544
00:44:03,446 --> 00:44:06,074
Since when is force a problem for you?

545
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:11,443
Why are you so desperate
to get your son back?

546
00:44:13,423 --> 00:44:15,152
'Cause he's my son.

547
00:44:15,391 --> 00:44:19,054
What's the last thing you said to him
before you left him?

548
00:44:21,164 --> 00:44:22,256
Well, then, go!

549
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,728
Seems to me that the knowledge
of your son's impending death

550
00:44:26,803 --> 00:44:28,361
is causing you to act.

551
00:44:28,438 --> 00:44:30,906
Forgive all his sins,
to wipe the slate clean...

552
00:44:30,974 --> 00:44:35,240
Why is it that we're only willing to do that
when a life is at stake?

553
00:44:35,311 --> 00:44:37,541
I've always loved my son.
That's never changed.

554
00:44:37,614 --> 00:44:40,276
No, no. It's changed now.

555
00:44:41,785 --> 00:44:44,015
You see, the knowledge of death
changes everything.

556
00:44:44,087 --> 00:44:48,387
If I were to tell you the exact date
and time of your own death,

557
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:51,554
it would shatter your world completely.

558
00:44:52,128 --> 00:44:53,356
I know.

559
00:44:55,131 --> 00:44:58,430
<i>Can you imagine what it feels like
to have someone sit you down...</i>

560
00:44:58,501 --> 00:44:59,934
John Kramer.

561
00:45:00,203 --> 00:45:02,967
<i>...and tell you that you're dying?</i>

562
00:45:05,875 --> 00:45:07,934
<i>The gravity of that?</i>

563
00:45:10,947 --> 00:45:13,108
That the clock's ticking for you.

564
00:45:16,352 --> 00:45:19,048
<i>In a split second,
your world is cracked open.</i>

565
00:45:19,122 --> 00:45:22,216
<i>You look at things differently.
You smell things differently.</i>

566
00:45:23,126 --> 00:45:27,358
You savor everything, be it a glass of water
or a walk in the park.

567
00:45:28,231 --> 00:45:29,892
The clock is ticking, John.

568
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,394
But most people have the luxury

569
00:45:31,467 --> 00:45:33,662
of not knowing
when that clock's gonna go off,

570
00:45:33,736 --> 00:45:37,137
and the irony of it is that
that keeps them from really living their life.

571
00:45:37,207 --> 00:45:40,040
It keeps them sleepwalking.

572
00:45:40,109 --> 00:45:44,546
It keeps them drinking that glass of water,
but never really tasting it.

573
00:45:44,914 --> 00:45:47,144
You can still fix this, John.

574
00:45:48,585 --> 00:45:50,644
Yeah, but can we fix you?

575
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:52,211
Me?

576
00:45:53,356 --> 00:45:54,983
I'm not fixable.

577
00:45:55,758 --> 00:45:57,350
I've got cancer.

578
00:46:01,364 --> 00:46:03,855
You're using cancer as an excuse
for what you do?

579
00:46:03,933 --> 00:46:05,195
No.

580
00:46:06,970 --> 00:46:09,939
The cancer isn't what started me
in my work.

581
00:46:11,107 --> 00:46:13,837
It was the moment I decided to end my life

582
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:16,037
that started me in my work

583
00:46:16,112 --> 00:46:18,137
and brought meaning to it.

584
00:46:23,486 --> 00:46:24,475
Fuck!

585
00:46:24,554 --> 00:46:27,648
<i>I had literally driven myself to suicide,</i>

586
00:46:27,724 --> 00:46:29,385
and I had failed.

587
00:46:29,692 --> 00:46:33,253
<i>My body had not been strong enough
to repel cancer cells,</i>

588
00:46:33,596 --> 00:46:36,326
yet I had lived through a plunge off a cliff.

589
00:46:42,338 --> 00:46:45,865
But, to my amazement, I was alive.

590
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:50,540
<i>And I was determined
to spend the rest of my days</i>

591
00:46:51,114 --> 00:46:53,605
<i>testing the fabric of human nature.</i>

592
00:46:59,022 --> 00:47:00,990
Do you understand, Eric?

593
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:05,158
You got a chance to do something.
Do it right now, John.

594
00:47:05,228 --> 00:47:07,423
Just tell me where my son is.

595
00:47:08,164 --> 00:47:09,358
I'll help you.

596
00:47:09,432 --> 00:47:13,027
I don't need your help,
and I can tell you still don't understand.

597
00:47:13,603 --> 00:47:17,198
Those who don't appreciate life
do not deserve life.

598
00:47:17,740 --> 00:47:19,970
My son appreciates his life.

599
00:47:20,043 --> 00:47:24,412
But do you appreciate yours?
Do you appreciate your son's?

600
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,311
Oh, this is shit!

601
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:29,450
Don't forget the rules

602
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:33,585
if you wanna find your son.

603
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:37,983
Where are you?

604
00:47:39,262 --> 00:47:41,753
No. No, we don't have 15 minutes.

605
00:47:41,831 --> 00:47:44,595
We need that location to the video feed.

606
00:47:57,513 --> 00:48:00,846
Hey. I don't think we should stop, okay?

607
00:48:02,452 --> 00:48:04,352
Laura, can you hear me?

608
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:10,687
That's the second time
I've had to wake up in this shithole.

609
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:13,788
Think you can stand up?

610
00:48:14,263 --> 00:48:17,357
Yeah, but I don't really want to.

611
00:48:18,501 --> 00:48:20,628
There's so much left to do.

612
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:24,536
So many people left to talk to.

613
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,371
This can't be it.

614
00:48:35,118 --> 00:48:36,380
It's not.

615
00:48:43,526 --> 00:48:46,859
- Amanda, you said you survived this, right?
- I what?

616
00:48:48,464 --> 00:48:50,694
This guy, whoever's doing it,

617
00:48:50,767 --> 00:48:53,702
you said that you've played before
and you survived.

618
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:55,067
Yeah.

619
00:48:55,705 --> 00:48:58,003
So that means we could survive.

620
00:48:59,842 --> 00:49:01,104
Yeah.

621
00:49:02,011 --> 00:49:04,206
Wait. Amanda, why did he pick you?

622
00:49:05,681 --> 00:49:08,047
Because I was a fucking junkie.

623
00:49:16,726 --> 00:49:20,093
And the funny thing is,
I passed his little test.

624
00:49:22,065 --> 00:49:25,330
If you passed his test,
then why are you back here?

625
00:49:27,303 --> 00:49:29,999
<i>I wasn't being very good to myself.</i>

626
00:49:40,283 --> 00:49:44,049
- How long have you...
- I started in jail.

627
00:49:45,855 --> 00:49:48,722
- What were you arrested for?
- Possession.

628
00:49:50,159 --> 00:49:51,854
But I thought you said that...

629
00:49:51,928 --> 00:49:55,125
Maybe you should talk
to the cop who arrested me.

630
00:49:57,633 --> 00:50:00,534
I'm guessing
you've never been arrested before.

631
00:50:00,603 --> 00:50:01,831
No.

632
00:50:02,572 --> 00:50:06,338
I mean, I've been in trouble a few times,
you know, in and out of stuff.

633
00:50:06,409 --> 00:50:07,876
My dad's a...

634
00:50:12,248 --> 00:50:14,079
He's a real hardass.

635
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:19,350
You know, he's probably got half the city
right now looking for me

636
00:50:19,422 --> 00:50:22,482
just so he can kick my ass
for disappearing on him.

637
00:50:23,693 --> 00:50:25,058
Yeah.

638
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:26,961
Probably.

639
00:50:33,302 --> 00:50:36,499
We found a door. Come on.

640
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:42,468
Come on. We have to go.

641
00:50:44,147 --> 00:50:47,844
It's the only one without a lock,
but we can't get it open.

642
00:51:02,798 --> 00:51:05,392
- How's it going?
- It's stuck on something.

643
00:51:05,468 --> 00:51:06,730
Oh, shit.

644
00:51:07,370 --> 00:51:10,703
- Here, let me try. Move, move! Come on.
- Will you take it easy? Jesus!

645
00:51:10,773 --> 00:51:12,502
Just back up, all right?

646
00:51:28,057 --> 00:51:30,150
If it's stuck, it's a trap.

647
00:51:30,593 --> 00:51:32,424
Lady, this whole house is a trap.

648
00:51:32,495 --> 00:51:35,896
Obviously someone didn't want us
to get into this room.

649
00:52:07,463 --> 00:52:09,294
- Now what?
- I'm gonna be right back, okay?

650
00:52:09,365 --> 00:52:12,698
Whatever we do,
we got four minutes to get it done.

651
00:52:35,391 --> 00:52:38,383
<i>Hello, Xavier. I want to play a game.</i>

652
00:52:38,761 --> 00:52:42,128
<i>The game I want to play is very similar</i>

653
00:52:42,198 --> 00:52:45,759
<i>to the one that you've been playing
as a drug dealer.</i>

654
00:52:46,535 --> 00:52:50,437
<i>The game of offering hope to the desperate
for a price.</i>

655
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:54,176
<i>I think we can agree
that your situation is desperate.</i>

656
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,510
<i>So I offer you hope.</i>

657
00:52:56,579 --> 00:53:01,312
<i>The price you pay is that you must crawl
into the same pit of squalor</i>

658
00:53:01,384 --> 00:53:03,750
<i>you force your customers into.</i>

659
00:53:04,453 --> 00:53:06,182
<i>- By entering this room...
- Oh, my God.</i>

660
00:53:06,255 --> 00:53:07,950
<i>...a timer has been started.</i>

661
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:11,957
<i>When the timer expires, the door
in front of you will be locked forever.</i>

662
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:14,019
<i>- Only in finding the key...
- Guys? Guys.</i>

663
00:53:14,096 --> 00:53:15,461
- What?
- Look.

664
00:53:15,531 --> 00:53:18,261
<i>...before the timer runs out
can you unlock it</i>

665
00:53:18,567 --> 00:53:21,035
<i>- and retrieve the antidote inside.
- Oh, my God.</i>

666
00:53:21,103 --> 00:53:25,233
<i>I will give you just one hint
as to where that key is.</i>

667
00:53:31,881 --> 00:53:34,941
<i>It will be like finding a needle
in a haystack.</i>

668
00:53:36,886 --> 00:53:38,717
<i>Let the game begin.</i>

669
00:53:40,222 --> 00:53:42,247
Somebody's going in there.

670
00:53:42,692 --> 00:53:45,456
Now, look,
somebody's fucking going in there, man.

671
00:53:50,399 --> 00:53:51,525
No! No! No!

672
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:53,261
- Oh, shit.
- What the fuck are you doing?

673
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:55,304
- Stop.
- What are you doing?

674
00:53:55,371 --> 00:53:56,998
- No! No!
- What the fuck are you doing?

675
00:53:57,073 --> 00:53:59,098
- No! No! Please!
- Let her go now.

676
00:53:59,175 --> 00:54:00,335
No!

677
00:54:01,844 --> 00:54:02,936
Shit!

678
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,378
My God.

679
00:54:09,452 --> 00:54:10,919
Come on!

680
00:54:13,322 --> 00:54:15,847
- We don't have time!
- Oh, shit.

681
00:54:20,496 --> 00:54:22,794
What the fuck's wrong with you?

682
00:54:23,132 --> 00:54:24,895
What are you doing?

683
00:54:25,167 --> 00:54:28,159
- You're out of your fucking mind.
- Hurry up.

684
00:54:29,171 --> 00:54:30,502
Oh, shit!

685
00:54:31,807 --> 00:54:33,035
Come on!

686
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:35,905
We don't have time.

687
00:54:41,384 --> 00:54:43,215
Keep fucking looking.

688
00:54:46,088 --> 00:54:48,386
- Come on! Come on!
- Fuck you!

689
00:54:50,493 --> 00:54:52,120
What the fuck?

690
00:55:06,308 --> 00:55:08,037
Somebody's gotta help her.

691
00:55:08,911 --> 00:55:10,708
What the fuck, guys?

692
00:55:15,618 --> 00:55:16,607
Fuck!

693
00:55:37,339 --> 00:55:39,500
No. No. No. No.

694
00:55:40,109 --> 00:55:41,576
No!

695
00:55:41,911 --> 00:55:43,503
No. No!

696
00:55:45,881 --> 00:55:47,109
Come on.

697
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:49,250
No, no, no.

698
00:56:11,073 --> 00:56:13,564
- You fucking bitch!
- All right. That's enough.

699
00:56:13,642 --> 00:56:15,906
That's not nearly enough, man.

700
00:56:15,978 --> 00:56:17,707
Stop this bullshit.

701
00:56:20,316 --> 00:56:22,216
Did you hear that tape?

702
00:56:24,253 --> 00:56:27,689
He knows about us. Our names.

703
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,984
There's something that we're not seeing.

704
00:56:31,427 --> 00:56:32,519
Jail.

705
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:37,164
You said you three had been there.

706
00:56:38,234 --> 00:56:39,701
Make it four.

707
00:56:43,138 --> 00:56:45,834
- For what?
- Doesn't matter.

708
00:56:46,976 --> 00:56:49,103
Anybody else wanna own up?

709
00:56:50,479 --> 00:56:53,642
What about you?
You got juvie written all over you.

710
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:55,812
No, never been.

711
00:56:56,385 --> 00:56:57,716
All right.

712
00:56:58,153 --> 00:57:00,178
- Let's talk this out.
- No.

713
00:57:00,756 --> 00:57:02,348
No more talking.

714
00:57:02,558 --> 00:57:06,289
The only thing you people have in common
is holding me back.

715
00:57:07,863 --> 00:57:09,160
I'm gone.

716
00:57:29,652 --> 00:57:32,416
- Where is this goddamn tech team?
- They'll be here any second.

717
00:57:32,488 --> 00:57:34,115
I'm not listening to this anymore.

718
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:38,182
- Another second is too fucking long.
- Look, I know how this guy works, okay?

719
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,625
He's playing a game.

720
00:57:39,695 --> 00:57:41,754
Eric just needs to stay in it
a little bit longer.

721
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,821
Take a look at the clock.

722
00:57:45,601 --> 00:57:49,469
You need to start thinking outside the box,
or his son is gonna end up in one.

723
00:57:55,978 --> 00:57:57,275
His work.

724
00:57:58,847 --> 00:58:00,974
You wanna get to him, that's how you do it.

725
00:58:01,584 --> 00:58:03,484
I mean, he's relishing this.

726
00:58:03,552 --> 00:58:06,612
It's an opportunity to be heard,
to be studied.

727
00:58:06,689 --> 00:58:08,884
Threaten to destroy his work.

728
00:58:37,753 --> 00:58:40,813
How will you get your conviction
without all this evidence, Eric?

729
00:58:40,889 --> 00:58:42,652
I don't need this shit to convict you.

730
00:58:42,725 --> 00:58:45,250
So go ahead. Destroy it.

731
00:58:45,327 --> 00:58:47,318
- I will.
- Destroy it all.

732
00:58:49,565 --> 00:58:52,625
Just know it will not save your son
if you do.

733
00:58:52,701 --> 00:58:54,259
You kill my son, I kill you.

734
00:58:54,336 --> 00:58:55,633
Go ahead.

735
00:58:56,005 --> 00:58:59,566
Why wait? We both know
the sort of person you are, sir.

736
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:01,166
- Get out of here.
- The sort of person

737
00:59:01,243 --> 00:59:03,871
who guns down an unarmed suspect.

738
00:59:03,946 --> 00:59:06,744
In fact,
the sort of person who plants evidence

739
00:59:06,815 --> 00:59:09,010
in order to obtain a conviction.

740
00:59:09,084 --> 00:59:12,918
The sort of person whose wife leaves him
and whose son hates him.

741
00:59:12,988 --> 00:59:14,649
Shut the fuck up!

742
00:59:16,792 --> 00:59:19,625
- Okay, set up all the traces to the satellite.
- Let's go.

743
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:23,354
Your tech team's arrived.

744
00:59:24,466 --> 00:59:25,933
Just in time.

745
00:59:27,202 --> 00:59:30,433
You better hope
they find the source of that feed.

746
00:59:33,242 --> 00:59:34,732
There's something I haven't told you, Eric.

747
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:36,141
I'm done listening to you.

748
00:59:36,211 --> 00:59:38,008
Maybe I can just show it to you.

749
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:40,776
But, unfortunately, it's going to be difficult
for me to get it myself,

750
00:59:40,849 --> 00:59:44,945
so perhaps you could ask the people
who are listening on that walkie in there

751
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,885
if they could get it for me, all right?

752
00:59:48,724 --> 00:59:50,021
Brown desk.

753
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:51,855
<i>Second drawer down.</i>

754
00:59:59,134 --> 01:00:01,728
You may not remember all those people,

755
01:00:01,804 --> 01:00:04,034
<i>but I'm sure they remember you.</i>

756
01:00:05,541 --> 01:00:08,635
<i>You were the arresting officer
in all of their cases,</i>

757
01:00:08,711 --> 01:00:11,202
<i>and you were the one
who planted all the evidence</i>

758
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,646
<i>used to obtain their convictions.</i>

759
01:00:13,716 --> 01:00:15,946
<i>You were the one who put them away.</i>

760
01:00:16,018 --> 01:00:17,576
<i>Your son is playing a game</i>

761
01:00:17,653 --> 01:00:21,111
<i>with a lot of people
who don't like you very much, Detective.</i>

762
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:25,422
<i>It would be a shame
if they discovered who he was.</i>

763
01:01:21,817 --> 01:01:24,718
<i>You all possess
the combination to the safe.</i>

764
01:01:24,787 --> 01:01:28,518
<i>Think hard.
The numbers are in the back of your mind.</i>

765
01:01:29,725 --> 01:01:33,786
<i>The clue to their order can be found
over the rainbow.</i>

766
01:01:33,862 --> 01:01:35,591
Son of a bitch.

767
01:01:58,086 --> 01:02:01,283
- What are you doing?
- I haven't decided yet.

768
01:02:02,558 --> 01:02:05,493
You know, the others,
they're scared of you.

769
01:02:06,128 --> 01:02:07,220
Good.

770
01:02:09,865 --> 01:02:11,264
You and me,

771
01:02:11,934 --> 01:02:14,994
we can keep going at each other
like we're back in the yard,

772
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:18,904
or we can come together
and figure out who's doing this to us.

773
01:02:19,041 --> 01:02:21,771
You and the others can do what you want.

774
01:02:22,411 --> 01:02:25,005
I already found what I'm looking for.

775
01:02:29,184 --> 01:02:30,947
You remind me of me.

776
01:02:31,086 --> 01:02:33,452
No matter
what kind of fucked-up situation you're in,

777
01:02:33,522 --> 01:02:36,047
you always gotta find yourself an enemy.

778
01:02:36,191 --> 01:02:38,819
You know what? I got enemies, man.

779
01:02:40,028 --> 01:02:42,462
Outside these fucking walls, bro.

780
01:02:44,032 --> 01:02:46,159
And they're looking for me.

781
01:02:46,335 --> 01:02:50,635
And if they don't find me,
they're going after the ones closest to me.

782
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:52,304
My family.

783
01:02:54,176 --> 01:02:55,700
You understand?

784
01:02:56,745 --> 01:02:57,803
No.

785
01:02:58,847 --> 01:03:00,610
I don't understand.

786
01:03:01,917 --> 01:03:04,818
It's just me, and that's the way I like it.

787
01:03:05,387 --> 01:03:07,753
Now, turn around.

788
01:03:08,924 --> 01:03:12,155
- What?
- Turn around.

789
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,802
Oh, shit.

790
01:04:33,442 --> 01:04:36,138
- No. We can't stop.
- Shit.

791
01:04:38,780 --> 01:04:40,611
Oh, my God.

792
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:45,349
We've been here for two hours.
If what that tape says is true,

793
01:04:45,420 --> 01:04:48,014
then in one hour, the front door will open.

794
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,819
We're not gonna make it that long.

795
01:04:49,891 --> 01:04:51,518
That's a real winning attitude.

796
01:04:51,593 --> 01:04:52,890
She knows what she's talking about.

797
01:04:52,961 --> 01:04:54,258
Oh, yeah?

798
01:04:54,529 --> 01:04:56,258
"X" marks the spot.

799
01:04:56,898 --> 01:04:58,024
What?

800
01:04:58,333 --> 01:04:59,925
"X" marks...

801
01:05:00,502 --> 01:05:01,969
Marks the spot.

802
01:05:02,037 --> 01:05:03,766
There's the answer.

803
01:05:13,348 --> 01:05:15,475
What are you doing with him?

804
01:05:17,519 --> 01:05:19,282
This is your father?

805
01:05:19,521 --> 01:05:21,546
- What? You know him?
- Yeah.

806
01:05:22,491 --> 01:05:25,324
He's the guy who put me away.
He set me up.

807
01:05:29,765 --> 01:05:32,063
Tell me that's not your father.

808
01:05:45,247 --> 01:05:47,044
It's okay. It's okay.

809
01:06:07,702 --> 01:06:09,693
I can't trust any of you.

810
01:06:14,076 --> 01:06:16,067
You two are on your own.

811
01:06:21,616 --> 01:06:24,141
Now we know what we have in common.

812
01:06:24,686 --> 01:06:26,916
Amanda, please. I didn't know.

813
01:06:28,123 --> 01:06:30,455
Hey, kid! Amanda!

814
01:06:30,992 --> 01:06:32,482
Where are you?

815
01:06:36,098 --> 01:06:37,998
Please don't leave me.

816
01:07:04,259 --> 01:07:05,783
We gotta move.

817
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:13,130
Hey, kid!

818
01:07:14,302 --> 01:07:15,496
Amanda!

819
01:07:16,171 --> 01:07:17,866
I found a way out.

820
01:07:32,687 --> 01:07:33,881
Eight.

821
01:08:03,318 --> 01:08:04,580
Hey, kid!

822
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:16,524
Do not run.

823
01:08:44,459 --> 01:08:46,256
Eric. Eric.

824
01:08:46,328 --> 01:08:47,590
No! Stop!

825
01:08:48,029 --> 01:08:49,553
Get off of me!

826
01:08:50,432 --> 01:08:52,229
We tried it your way.

827
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,669
You motherfucker! Where is he?

828
01:09:02,310 --> 01:09:03,402
Eric.

829
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:13,348
Damn it.

830
01:09:16,858 --> 01:09:20,385
I'd like to go now
until your son is pissing blood.

831
01:09:35,477 --> 01:09:38,605
Now, that's the Eric Matthews
they gave medals to.

832
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:30,660
Help!

833
01:10:33,001 --> 01:10:34,662
Help me!

834
01:10:38,239 --> 01:10:39,638
Oh, my God.

835
01:10:40,008 --> 01:10:41,168
Jonas.

836
01:10:42,844 --> 01:10:45,813
Help me! Help me!

837
01:10:50,452 --> 01:10:52,147
Help!

838
01:11:11,272 --> 01:11:12,466
Please.

839
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:17,409
It's okay.

840
01:11:17,479 --> 01:11:19,310
- Help me.
- It's okay.

841
01:11:24,452 --> 01:11:26,283
No. No.

842
01:11:28,523 --> 01:11:30,388
No!

843
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:31,886
Fucker!

844
01:11:44,372 --> 01:11:47,000
No!

845
01:11:55,417 --> 01:11:56,611
Amanda.

846
01:12:05,193 --> 01:12:07,718
Nobody's listening anymore, asshole.

847
01:12:11,966 --> 01:12:15,197
Open your mouth. Open your mouth!
Come on.

848
01:12:15,437 --> 01:12:16,631
There you go.

849
01:12:16,704 --> 01:12:19,400
You gonna tell me where he is now, huh?

850
01:12:20,175 --> 01:12:21,199
What?

851
01:12:23,411 --> 01:12:24,901
Say it again.

852
01:12:27,282 --> 01:12:28,874
Game over.

853
01:12:30,018 --> 01:12:32,145
I'll take you to the house.

854
01:12:33,855 --> 01:12:36,688
You're gonna take me right now.
Right now.

855
01:12:37,125 --> 01:12:39,059
I will only take you.

856
01:12:40,495 --> 01:12:41,894
No one else.

857
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:48,434
All right. Just me and you.

858
01:12:49,571 --> 01:12:53,905
- How do we get out of here?
- There's a button on the wall.

859
01:12:54,442 --> 01:12:56,069
You'd better hurry.

860
01:12:57,712 --> 01:12:59,805
There's not much time left.

861
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:22,460
- The elevator!
- Come on!

862
01:13:23,671 --> 01:13:24,660
Fuck!

863
01:13:25,006 --> 01:13:27,031
Secure the warehouse now!

864
01:13:28,943 --> 01:13:31,639
- All right, let's go! Go! Go, go, go!
- Damn it.

865
01:13:33,381 --> 01:13:35,008
We've got a lock.

866
01:13:35,583 --> 01:13:38,017
This is Kerry. They're both gone.

867
01:13:44,592 --> 01:13:47,425
If I don't find my son, I swear to God...

868
01:13:50,498 --> 01:13:52,261
<i>Kerry, they're gone.</i>

869
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:54,034
<i>Fucking gone.</i>

870
01:13:57,005 --> 01:14:00,304
Yes! Kerry. We got a lock.
We got a lock on the house.

871
01:14:00,375 --> 01:14:01,933
- Rigg, we got it.
- What?

872
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,477
<i>237 North Hyde Crescent.</i>

873
01:14:03,545 --> 01:14:06,139
<i>- That's North Hyde Crescent.
- 237 North Hyde Crescent. Got it.</i>

874
01:14:10,218 --> 01:14:11,708
Where to now?

875
01:14:13,922 --> 01:14:15,446
Straight ahead.

876
01:14:20,428 --> 01:14:23,056
Come on, come on. Where are you?

877
01:14:24,966 --> 01:14:26,866
Make a right on Alfred.

878
01:14:34,709 --> 01:14:36,609
Open the fucking door!

879
01:14:37,512 --> 01:14:38,911
Open the door!

880
01:14:38,980 --> 01:14:40,880
There's nowhere to go.

881
01:14:41,349 --> 01:14:44,580
All I want is the number
on the back of your head.

882
01:14:48,590 --> 01:14:51,218
There's nowhere to go! Come on, Amanda!

883
01:14:51,292 --> 01:14:52,884
I can't hold it.

884
01:14:55,630 --> 01:14:57,154
Come on! Let me in!

885
01:14:57,231 --> 01:14:58,562
Let me in!

886
01:15:04,305 --> 01:15:06,068
Open the door! Come on!

887
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:07,402
What do we do?

888
01:15:07,475 --> 01:15:09,773
Take a left at the next street.

889
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,241
It's the last house on the left.

890
01:15:14,816 --> 01:15:16,078
Oh, shit.

891
01:15:17,518 --> 01:15:18,610
Shit!

892
01:15:19,554 --> 01:15:20,782
Come on!

893
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,017
Come on, Amanda!

894
01:15:24,459 --> 01:15:27,394
- Amanda, what is it?
- It's a door.

895
01:15:27,962 --> 01:15:29,259
It's a fucking door.

896
01:15:29,330 --> 01:15:32,390
You have nowhere to go!
You have nowhere to go!

897
01:15:38,106 --> 01:15:39,300
Come on!

898
01:15:39,374 --> 01:15:41,342
Help me move this thing.

899
01:15:46,714 --> 01:15:48,614
I'm not gonna hurt you.

900
01:15:53,588 --> 01:15:55,180
Come on, Amanda!

901
01:15:55,456 --> 01:15:56,787
Shit, it's locked!

902
01:15:56,858 --> 01:15:58,223
Let me in!

903
01:15:59,460 --> 01:16:01,451
Come on, open the door!

904
01:16:02,263 --> 01:16:03,252
Come on!

905
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:06,163
The key.
The one we found with the tape recorder.

906
01:16:06,234 --> 01:16:07,997
Where is it? Where is it?

907
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:09,161
Fuck!

908
01:16:09,404 --> 01:16:11,235
Jonas. Jonas had it last.

909
01:16:11,305 --> 01:16:14,240
- Come on, Amanda!
- Find it! Hurry!

910
01:16:15,043 --> 01:16:16,271
Come on!

911
01:16:21,816 --> 01:16:23,408
Come on, open the door!

912
01:16:23,484 --> 01:16:24,815
Let me in!

913
01:16:31,526 --> 01:16:36,463
Eric, you're gonna need this key
when you get inside the house.

914
01:17:06,294 --> 01:17:08,159
Where the hell are we?

915
01:17:10,264 --> 01:17:12,255
Run! Run!

916
01:17:23,244 --> 01:17:24,472
Daniel?

917
01:17:29,951 --> 01:17:31,179
Daniel!

918
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,220
Daniel, we gotta go!

919
01:17:34,288 --> 01:17:36,586
- We gotta go! Come on!
- Run.

920
01:17:44,198 --> 01:17:47,190
All right, come on.
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

921
01:17:47,268 --> 01:17:48,667
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

922
01:18:07,188 --> 01:18:08,553
Go, go, go!

923
01:18:09,056 --> 01:18:11,149
- Hallway's clear.
- We're in.

924
01:18:11,793 --> 01:18:12,987
Daniel!

925
01:18:13,461 --> 01:18:16,396
- The ground floor is secure.
- Moving up. Moving up.

926
01:18:16,464 --> 01:18:19,092
<i>Kerry, we're in the house.
I repeat, we're in the house.</i>

927
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:22,227
Cannot see you, Sergeant.
Repeat, cannot see you.

928
01:18:23,905 --> 01:18:26,271
Repeat. I cannot see you.

929
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,570
<i>- Where the hell is everybody?
- What is your 20?</i>

930
01:18:28,643 --> 01:18:30,304
<i>Rigg, do you copy?</i>

931
01:18:57,171 --> 01:18:58,832
<i>Hello, Mr. Hindle.</i>

932
01:18:59,473 --> 01:19:01,100
<i>Follow your heart.</i>

933
01:19:01,175 --> 01:19:02,665
<i>I really wish I had checked in there first.</i>

934
01:19:02,743 --> 01:19:04,608
<i>What the fuck is this?</i>

935
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:08,239
<i>My name is very fucking confused.
What's your name?</i>

936
01:19:08,316 --> 01:19:10,284
<i>I'm gonna kill your husband now,
Mrs. Gordon.</i>

937
01:19:10,351 --> 01:19:12,342
<i>He doesn't want us
to cut through our chains.</i>

938
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:14,581
<i>What are you doing to me? No!</i>

939
01:19:14,655 --> 01:19:15,849
<i>He wants us to cut through our feet.</i>

940
01:19:15,923 --> 01:19:17,481
<i>No! Oh, my God!</i>

941
01:19:18,993 --> 01:19:20,119
<i>It hurts!</i>

942
01:19:22,196 --> 01:19:23,254
<i>No!</i>

943
01:19:43,150 --> 01:19:44,742
Daniel!

944
01:19:52,627 --> 01:19:55,095
Daniel, no. Don't leave me.

945
01:19:57,531 --> 01:19:58,725
Please.

946
01:20:09,143 --> 01:20:10,474
He's gone.

947
01:20:11,913 --> 01:20:13,141
Doesn't matter.

948
01:20:13,314 --> 01:20:15,942
All I want is the number
on the back of his neck.

949
01:20:16,017 --> 01:20:17,541
And then yours.

950
01:20:20,554 --> 01:20:23,216
You still don't know your own number.

951
01:20:23,291 --> 01:20:26,317
How are you gonna get it if I don't tell you?

952
01:20:54,822 --> 01:20:56,016
Daniel!

953
01:21:20,081 --> 01:21:21,070
Shit.

954
01:21:31,926 --> 01:21:32,915
Run!

955
01:21:54,181 --> 01:21:55,273
Fuck.

956
01:22:08,429 --> 01:22:09,657
Daniel?

957
01:22:12,299 --> 01:22:14,699
I still cannot see you, Sergeant.

958
01:22:14,969 --> 01:22:16,630
Rigg, do you copy?

959
01:22:20,441 --> 01:22:22,466
- Left side clear.
- Right side clear.

960
01:22:22,543 --> 01:22:23,908
All clear.

961
01:22:25,446 --> 01:22:29,610
<i>I still can't see you, Sergeant.
I repeat, cannot see you.</i>

962
01:22:53,074 --> 01:22:54,405
It's not live.

963
01:22:54,675 --> 01:22:56,438
Kerry, we're in the wrong fucking house!

964
01:22:56,510 --> 01:22:59,035
<i>They've been dead this whole fucking time.</i>

965
01:22:59,113 --> 01:23:00,444
<i>- Get your team out of there.
- Let's go.</i>

966
01:23:02,283 --> 01:23:03,511
Daniel?

967
01:23:23,504 --> 01:23:24,698
Daniel?

968
01:23:39,987 --> 01:23:41,181
Daniel?

969
01:23:46,327 --> 01:23:47,521
Daniel.

970
01:23:59,273 --> 01:24:00,535
Daniel.

971
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:50,282
<i>Hello, Eric.
You probably don't even remember me,</i>

972
01:25:50,718 --> 01:25:52,913
<i>but you changed my life once.</i>

973
01:25:53,821 --> 01:25:55,721
<i>You sent me to prison.</i>

974
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:58,289
<i>I was guilty of a lot of things,</i>

975
01:25:58,759 --> 01:26:01,626
<i>but not the drug charge you framed me for.</i>

976
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:06,364
<i>You wouldn't know the things you lose
when you're locked away.</i>

977
01:26:06,533 --> 01:26:11,402
<i>The second time
somebody changed my life, I was guilty.</i>

978
01:26:11,472 --> 01:26:12,962
<i>Hello, Amanda.</i>

979
01:26:13,407 --> 01:26:15,307
<i>But my life was saved that day.</i>

980
01:26:15,376 --> 01:26:17,606
- You said you survived this, right?
- Yeah.

981
01:26:19,146 --> 01:26:24,106
<i>I found myself a father, a leader, a teacher.</i>

982
01:26:24,618 --> 01:26:26,449
You must meet death

983
01:26:27,121 --> 01:26:28,986
in order to be reborn.

984
01:26:30,391 --> 01:26:32,086
He helped me.

985
01:26:32,159 --> 01:26:34,593
<i>What is the cure for cancer, Eric?</i>

986
01:26:34,662 --> 01:26:38,029
Those who don't appreciate life
do not deserve life.

987
01:26:38,799 --> 01:26:40,994
<i>The cure for death itself?</i>

988
01:26:41,068 --> 01:26:43,798
<i>The answer is immortality.</i>

989
01:26:45,072 --> 01:26:47,267
Daniel!

990
01:26:49,543 --> 01:26:51,408
<i>By creating a legacy,</i>

991
01:26:52,179 --> 01:26:56,548
<i>by living a life worth remembering,
you become immortal.</i>

992
01:26:57,051 --> 01:27:00,350
<i>So now you find the tables are turned.</i>

993
01:27:00,421 --> 01:27:01,683
He asked for you.

994
01:27:01,755 --> 01:27:03,245
- What the fuck do you want?
- I told you.

995
01:27:03,324 --> 01:27:04,586
He wants us to survive this.

996
01:27:04,658 --> 01:27:06,250
I want to play a game.

997
01:27:06,560 --> 01:27:08,289
You have to play by the fucking rules!

998
01:27:08,362 --> 01:27:09,522
The rules are simple.

999
01:27:09,596 --> 01:27:11,325
All you have to do is sit here
and talk to me.

1000
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:12,387
What?

1001
01:27:12,466 --> 01:27:14,798
If you can do that long enough,
you will find your son

1002
01:27:14,868 --> 01:27:16,062
in a safe and secure state.

1003
01:27:16,136 --> 01:27:17,262
What the fuck is that?

1004
01:27:17,338 --> 01:27:19,101
It's your son, Daniel.
You remember him, don't you?

1005
01:27:19,173 --> 01:27:20,197
My dad's a...

1006
01:27:20,274 --> 01:27:21,332
He's a real hardass.

1007
01:27:21,408 --> 01:27:22,636
<i>I call you unworthy</i>

1008
01:27:22,710 --> 01:27:24,678
<i>of the life that you've been given.</i>

1009
01:27:24,745 --> 01:27:26,804
<i>The knowledge
of your son's impending death</i>

1010
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:29,007
<i>has caused you to forgive all his sins.</i>

1011
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:32,052
Why is that we're only willing to do that
when a life is at stake?

1012
01:27:32,119 --> 01:27:33,177
Daniel!

1013
01:27:33,253 --> 01:27:34,277
I'm done listening to you.

1014
01:27:34,355 --> 01:27:35,379
Don't forget the rules.

1015
01:27:35,456 --> 01:27:36,445
Shut the fuck up!

1016
01:27:36,523 --> 01:27:37,512
He's playing a game.

1017
01:27:37,591 --> 01:27:38,580
I don't wanna talk to him.

1018
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:39,717
You're not saying shit.

1019
01:27:39,793 --> 01:27:41,158
We both know the sort of person you are.

1020
01:27:41,428 --> 01:27:43,692
I'd like to go now
until your son is pissing...

1021
01:27:44,865 --> 01:27:46,594
I'll take you to the house.

1022
01:27:46,667 --> 01:27:47,998
Daniel?

1023
01:27:49,636 --> 01:27:51,729
There's something I haven't told you, Eric.

1024
01:27:52,306 --> 01:27:56,003
<i>It is I who will carry on John's work
after he dies.</i>

1025
01:27:56,076 --> 01:27:57,668
Daniel!

1026
01:27:57,745 --> 01:28:00,771
So go ahead. Destroy it.

1027
01:28:00,848 --> 01:28:02,110
<i>And you...</i>

1028
01:28:02,182 --> 01:28:03,206
Daniel!

1029
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:06,116
<i>...are my first test subject.</i>

1030
01:28:06,553 --> 01:28:08,612
<i>Now you are locked away,</i>

1031
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:11,416
<i>helpless and alone.</i>

1032
01:28:15,295 --> 01:28:17,855
- You fucking bitch.
- Game over.

1033
01:28:18,165 --> 01:28:20,190
I'll fucking kill you!

1034
01:28:20,834 --> 01:28:22,734
You fucking bitch!

1035
01:28:23,437 --> 01:28:25,632
You fucking bitch!

1036
01:28:27,374 --> 01:28:29,365
I'll fucking kill you!

1037
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:31,304
No!

1038
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:38,244
No!
