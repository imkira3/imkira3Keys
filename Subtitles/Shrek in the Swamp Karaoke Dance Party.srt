00:00:02,711 --> 00:00:03,826
Hi, everybody,

2
00:00:03,921 --> 00:00:07,505
and welcome to the Shrek in the Swamp
karaoke dance party!

3
00:00:09,927 --> 00:00:11,792
I'm gonna take things down a little bit

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,507
with one of my personal favourites.

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,012
Don't go changin'

6
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,432
To try and please me

7
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:27,108
You've never let me down before

8
00:00:31,073 --> 00:00:33,860
I made it through the wilderness

9
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,158
You know I made it through

10
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:44,033
Didn't know how lost I was
Until I found you

11
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,210
Yeah!
I like big butts and I cannot lie

12
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,042
You other brothers can't deny

13
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,880
When a girl walks in
with an itty-bitty waist

14
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:52,924
And a round thing in your face you get...

15
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,801
Feelings

16
00:00:56,848 --> 00:01:00,215
It's fun to stay at the
YMCA

17
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,349
It's fun to stay at the
YMCA

18
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,315
Do you really want to hurt me?

19
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,110
Do you really want to make me cry?

20
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,147
Staying alive! Staying alive!

21
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,575
