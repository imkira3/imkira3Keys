1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:31,908
Illumination!

3
00:00:36,204 --> 00:00:38,414
Minion!

4
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:40,499
Yeah

5
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,629
ooh

6
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:47,423
when you wish upon a star

7
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,636
your dreams will take
you very far

8
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:56,515
but when you wish upon a dream

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,520
life ain't always what
it seems oh, yeah

10
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,024
freeze! Avl!

11
00:01:05,107 --> 00:01:06,651
No matter who you are...

12
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,486
Hey! Hey!

13
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,154
Stop right there!
Grab her!

14
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,744
Yeah, baby!
Attention, all units.

15
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,710
Look out!

16
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,754
You like that? Hey!

17
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,049
Shining star for you to see

18
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:32,468
what your life can truly be

19
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,971
shining star for you to see

20
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,306
what your life can truly be

21
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,475
shining star for you to see

22
00:01:39,558 --> 00:01:42,144
what your life can truly be

23
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:44,939
ooh, baby!

24
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:47,233
The anti-villain league
can't catch this.

25
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:48,734
Guess who stole the map.

26
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:55,700
Hallelujah!

27
00:01:57,368 --> 00:01:59,996
Yeah! I got this.

28
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,752
Ha-ha, good work.

29
00:02:09,255 --> 00:02:12,383
The map to the legendary
zodiac stone.

30
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:16,095
We will become the most
powerful villains in the world.

31
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:19,432
Okay, let's get a move on.

32
00:02:19,515 --> 00:02:21,267
We leave for Asia tonight.

33
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:50,671
Okay, let's see here.

34
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:15,154
I'm in.

35
00:03:42,473 --> 00:03:44,850
Hello, beautiful.

36
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,325
What?

37
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,860
Ha-ha, yes!

38
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:38,070
The zodiac stone.

39
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:52,793
Soon, the power of these
unstoppable beasts will be ours.

40
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,927
Oh, for crying out loud.

41
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:13,314
Whoa!

42
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,610
Whoa!

43
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:26,869
Hurry up!

44
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,663
I got a bunch of
deadly tchotchkes on my tail.

45
00:05:30,206 --> 00:05:32,082
Roger that on the copy.

46
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,751
Step on it, sister.

47
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,967
Hurry up!
Come on!

48
00:05:45,554 --> 00:05:46,639
Off! Off!

49
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,147
I got it.
I got the stone.

50
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:57,399
Party's over, old man.

51
00:05:57,483 --> 00:06:01,237
The vicious6 has a new head
honcho.

52
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:04,532
You just got played
for a sucker!

53
00:06:04,615 --> 00:06:07,493
Hold on.
I started this group.

54
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,827
We're a team.

55
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,704
Where's your loyalty?

56
00:06:10,788 --> 00:06:13,123
Oh, please. We're villains.

57
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:14,583
There's no such thing.

58
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:17,503
It's time for the next
generation.

59
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:49,952
Bang, bang.

60
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,871
Bang, bang.

61
00:06:54,623 --> 00:06:55,749
Bang, bang.

62
00:06:57,543 --> 00:06:58,544
Bang, bang.

63
00:07:16,604 --> 00:07:17,771
Hey

64
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:19,315
hey

65
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:20,816
hey

66
00:07:21,317 --> 00:07:22,318
hey

67
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,487
bang, bang

68
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,449
bang, bang.

69
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:36,790
Quiet down, class.

70
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,252
Quiet down, class.

71
00:07:40,336 --> 00:07:42,713
People, people.

72
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:47,384
So, what do you want to be when
you grow up? Ooh, ooh.

73
00:07:47,468 --> 00:07:49,637
Samantha. I want to be a doctor.

74
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,721
Wonderful.

75
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:51,805
Ooh, ooh! Bradley.

76
00:07:51,889 --> 00:07:53,140
I want to be a teacher.

77
00:07:53,223 --> 00:07:55,017
No, you do not.

78
00:07:55,643 --> 00:07:56,644
Yes. Me, me!

79
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:58,687
I want to be a fireman
who is also the president

80
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:00,939
and also drives race cars. Yeah.

81
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,232
Exciting.

82
00:08:03,025 --> 00:08:05,110
And what about you, gru?

83
00:08:06,445 --> 00:08:08,864
Gru? Me?

84
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,200
I want to be...

85
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:14,495
A supervillain.

86
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,582
Supervillain? Supervillain.

87
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,667
Loseh.

88
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:23,337
I'm having a bad, bad day

89
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,464
it's about time that
I get my way

90
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,216
Kelly! Daddy!

91
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,593
Mom! Brett!

92
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,053
Gru!

93
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,013
Kiss-a la mama!

94
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:36,433
Oh, my favorite tiny relatives.

95
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,062
Oh, no. Guys, come on.

96
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,691
Hey. I got an image
to uphold here.

97
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,986
Okay.

98
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,072
Hey, are you guys pumped
for the movie?

99
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:51,448
Let's go!

100
00:08:52,825 --> 00:08:53,826
Hey, hey, hey!

101
00:09:22,146 --> 00:09:23,564
Oh, no!

102
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:32,531
Shark! A shark!

103
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:43,459
I am a pinball wizard.

104
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,920
Swish. Swish. Swish.
Swish. Swish.

105
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,758
Swish. Swish. Swish. Swish.
Swish. Swish.

106
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:57,055
Bello. Bello.

107
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,891
Bello. Bello.

108
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,646
Yeah!

109
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:07,605
Everything you got.

110
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,276
A little more. Come on.

111
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,528
Put some
of those sprinkles on there.

112
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,822
I like those sprinkles.

113
00:10:17,659 --> 00:10:19,328
Cheese ray! Cheese ray!

114
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:20,454
Cheese ray!

115
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,415
Don't cheese me, bro.

116
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:29,797
Pank you!

117
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:31,799
Mmm.

118
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,885
So creamy, so delicious.

119
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,596
Worth every calorie.

120
00:10:40,057 --> 00:10:41,558
I'm having a bad, bad day

121
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:44,102
if you take it
personal, that's okay

122
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:45,562
watch, this is so fun to see...

123
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:47,648
Bills, magazines,

124
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,441
s&h green stamps.

125
00:10:57,074 --> 00:10:58,325
Holy guacamole!

126
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,285
Where can we listen?
Where can we listen?

127
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,171
Hello, Mr. Gru.

128
00:11:11,255 --> 00:11:12,881
We've received your application

129
00:11:12,965 --> 00:11:16,510
to the world's best
supervillain team, the vicious6.

130
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:20,264
A recent opening
has become available, and...

131
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,348
And?

132
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:23,350
Your interview
is tomorrow at noon.

133
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,894
Dyn-o-mite!

134
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,316
Please go to 417 main street.

135
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,862
The password is,
"you're no good."

136
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,364
"You're no good." Mmm-hmm.

137
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:39,241
Now, get up on the down stroke,

138
00:11:39,324 --> 00:11:42,202
'cause this invitation
is gonna explode, baby.

139
00:11:42,286 --> 00:11:43,662
Explode? Aw.

140
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,038
Oh, no, no, no, no!

141
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,428
Very big news, mom!

142
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,098
Mom?

143
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,521
Mom?

144
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,741
What?

145
00:12:20,824 --> 00:12:22,826
Mom, who is this sweaty guy?

146
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,661
He's stinking up the house.

147
00:12:24,745 --> 00:12:26,413
I thought you were
cooking cabbage.

148
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:28,665
He's my new guru.

149
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,542
Blah!

150
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,419
Blah!

151
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:33,921
Tell your weird buddies

152
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:36,590
they'd better start pulling
their weight around here,

153
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:37,883
or I'm kicking them out.

154
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,636
They are killing
my mellow vibes.

155
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,390
Hey! I heard that!

156
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,024
Come on. Let's go tell the
troops the good news.

157
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,611
Gentlemen, to the basement,

158
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,197
aka our new evil lair.

159
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,702
This is fantastic!

160
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,788
Oh, construction
looks great, guys.

161
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,353
My first evil lair.

162
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:32,729
Goose bumps!

163
00:13:35,732 --> 00:13:38,735
Well, you've got to break a
few eggs to make an omelet.

164
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:39,987
Am I right?

165
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:42,489
Oh, great job, Ryan. What?

166
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,907
I said great job!

167
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,826
What? Never mind.

168
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,037
Adrien, mack, looking good.

169
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,587
Joe, how's the family?

170
00:13:57,671 --> 00:13:59,297
Hey. Good, good.

171
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,676
Okay, everybody, get over here.

172
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:07,764
Now, listen up.
Buckle your overalls.

173
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:09,808
Hold on to your goggles.

174
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,978
The vicious6 wants to meet me.

175
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,146
Tomorrow.

176
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:18,275
Mini-boss!

177
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,901
Mini-boss! Mini-boss!

178
00:14:19,985 --> 00:14:21,945
All right, all right.
I'm not mini.

179
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,238
Please stop calling me that.

180
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:26,116
And also, they haven't
accepted me yet.

181
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,121
Hello, Otto. What is it?

182
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,584
Blah, blah, blah.

183
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:37,919
Uh-huh. Well, that...

184
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,213
Yes, I...

185
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:43,884
I... okay.

186
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,554
You know what would be fun?
Let's play the quiet game.

187
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:49,264
The quiet game! Si, si!

188
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:53,810
Anyway, thanks for the
hard work today, everyone.

189
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,270
I got to go get some rest.

190
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,231
Tomorrow is the biggest day
of my life.

191
00:14:59,483 --> 00:15:01,985
Watch out, world.
Here comes gru!

192
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:05,906
Mini-boss! Mini-boss! I'm not...

193
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,699
Mini-boss! Mini-boss!

194
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,007
These guys are the best.

195
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,550
I can't believe it.

196
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:30,347
Uh... mini-boss?

197
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,476
Yeah, I get it,

198
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:36,770
but I need a good night's
sleep, so get out.

199
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:40,107
Oh.

200
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:42,526
Okay, fine, fine.

201
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,944
Because you had a nightmare.

202
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,237
But just tonight.

203
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:51,701
I'm not buying
the nightmare story, though.

204
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,790
Excuse-a.

205
00:15:59,042 --> 00:16:00,836
- Oh, really? You, too?
- Mmm-hmm

206
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:01,920
get in.

207
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:06,466
Good night. Good night.

208
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,135
Yes, yes, yes. Good night.

209
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,804
Good night!

210
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:15,433
I just want to get some sleep.

211
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,271
Vnc

212
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:20,647
breaking news.

213
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,860
The vicious6 is ready to
rewrite the rules of villainy.

214
00:16:25,068 --> 00:16:26,736
Villains of the world,

215
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,157
in three days, when the
clock strikes midnight

216
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,576
and the Chinese new year begins,

217
00:16:32,659 --> 00:16:36,496
this bad boy's power
is gonna be unleashed.

218
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:39,040
With the power of the zodiac,

219
00:16:39,124 --> 00:16:42,294
we're gonna take out
the anti-villain league.

220
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,214
And the viciouss will be

221
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:49,301
the most powerful villains
on the planet.

222
00:16:49,384 --> 00:16:52,429
Can you dig it?

223
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,640
Do I dig it? Do I dig it?

224
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:57,976
I don't dig it.
There's nothing to dig.

225
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,270
They thought they could
leave me for dead, huh?

226
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:02,856
Kick me to the curb
like a piece of old meat?

227
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,442
Oh, they got no idea
what's coming.

228
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:06,735
Ha-ha!

229
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,737
Oh, I'm gonna make them suffer

230
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,381
for what they've done to me.
Mr. Knuckles?

231
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,115
Oh, boy. Hey, Mr. Knuckles.

232
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:13,200
What?

233
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,369
We just wanted to make sure
we'd be getting paid this week.

234
00:17:16,453 --> 00:17:18,038
What a mouth on you.

235
00:17:18,121 --> 00:17:19,706
I'm paying you with knowledge.

236
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,541
You are?

237
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:24,794
Lesson one, always be prepared.

238
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:30,508
Lesson two, the Belgian
eyeball nose pick.

239
00:17:30,592 --> 00:17:34,888
And lesson three,
the Lithuanian haircut.

240
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,980
That's worth
all the money in the world.

241
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,650
Hey, guys, forget about it.
You're gonna get paid.

242
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,486
But first, we got to
get my stone back.

243
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,198
I see a bad gru a-rising.

244
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,578
I see a villain on his way

245
00:17:58,912 --> 00:18:00,121
yee-haw!

246
00:18:00,914 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm gonna interview
with my heroes

247
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:08,964
they're going to love me
'cause I'm the best

248
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,842
don't mess up tonight

249
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:16,554
you're going to join
the vicious6, yeah

250
00:18:16,638 --> 00:18:19,307
there is a bad gru on the rise

251
00:18:19,391 --> 00:18:20,392
guys!

252
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,729
Oh, you want to come.

253
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:26,231
Yeah.

254
00:18:26,523 --> 00:18:29,067
Right, right. Okay.

255
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:35,532
When you guys tracked me down
and responded to my "help wanted" ad...

256
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,370
I was like, "who are
these tiny tater tots?"

257
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,414
"And where did they get
so much denim?"

258
00:18:49,337 --> 00:18:52,424
And you just wouldn't quit.

259
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,607
All right,
I surrender. Come on in.

260
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:19,826
We've had some
great times since then,

261
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:22,954
but the thing is, the vicious6,

262
00:19:23,038 --> 00:19:24,456
they're the big leagues,

263
00:19:24,789 --> 00:19:29,544
and you guys are great,

264
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,673
and so, the job you did
on the lair...

265
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:35,967
A-plus.

266
00:19:36,593 --> 00:19:38,887
It's just...
What I was thinking is that

267
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:42,057
there are a lot of
other villains in the world.

268
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,141
You know?

269
00:19:47,562 --> 00:19:49,564
Never mind.

270
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,984
Look, I think I just need
to fly solo on this.

271
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,445
See you later, alligators.

272
00:19:59,199 --> 00:20:01,576
- Kevin? Kevin!
- Oh...

273
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:11,544
Otto. Otto.

274
00:20:13,213 --> 00:20:14,422
Hide and seek.

275
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,674
Hide and seek? Hide and seek.

276
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:28,520
Go, go, go!

277
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,610
Hey, I'm walking here!

278
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:38,571
Whoa!

279
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:42,450
Ooh.

280
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:43,535
Here we go.

281
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,376
That I love ya, ineed ya

282
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,670
I want ya
got to have you, child...

283
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:56,214
Excuse me. Sir?

284
00:20:57,382 --> 00:21:01,678
I was just wondering
if you're no good.

285
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:05,265
Oh, you're good. My mistake.

286
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:10,687
Oh, oh, sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

287
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:14,399
I was just trying out
this new invention of mine.

288
00:21:14,858 --> 00:21:17,402
I call it sticky fingers.

289
00:21:17,485 --> 00:21:19,404
Or smart goo.

290
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:22,198
I haven't quite landed
on the name yet.

291
00:21:22,782 --> 00:21:23,825
Come here.

292
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:31,416
I overheard you were looking
for something... special.

293
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,751
Uh, yes. I was hoping...

294
00:21:33,835 --> 00:21:36,629
You're no good.

295
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:43,761
I think you'll enjoy
listening in booth three.

296
00:21:46,473 --> 00:21:47,724
Right this way.

297
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,402
Cat scratch fever...

298
00:22:00,945 --> 00:22:03,573
This is it. Mum's the word.
Keep it down. Good luck.

299
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:04,991
Let 'em have it, son.

300
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:08,953
Thanks, mister... nefario.

301
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,081
That's Dr. Nefario.

302
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:14,000
Here, take this.

303
00:22:14,918 --> 00:22:18,087
If you ever get famous, remember
who gave you your first gadget.

304
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:20,340
Okay.

305
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:28,097
Wouldn't blame him
if he said to me

306
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:30,058
you're no good you're no good

307
00:22:30,183 --> 00:22:31,535
you're no good...

308
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,811
Try backwards.

309
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:41,653
Welcome to the vicious6.

310
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:45,532
That is pretty... whoa!

311
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,293
Hello.

312
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,927
Everybody here
for the interview?

313
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,346
Me, too.

314
00:23:09,347 --> 00:23:12,350
So, what do you guys got going
on later? Are you up to no good?

315
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,019
You gonna get into
some mischief?

316
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,399
Okay.

317
00:23:20,441 --> 00:23:21,985
Send the first one in.

318
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:24,195
They're ready to
see you, Mr. Gru.

319
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,322
Oh, good.

320
00:23:26,406 --> 00:23:27,407
Great.

321
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:01,816
Distinguished villains,

322
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:04,110
my name is gr...

323
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:09,741
I feel like I'm talking too
loud even though our proximity

324
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:13,328
doesn't require
this kind of volume.

325
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:20,251
If you told me when I was ten

326
00:24:20,335 --> 00:24:22,754
that I would have the chance
to fill the shoes

327
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:24,922
of my favorite villain ever,

328
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,383
wild knuckles, I would say,

329
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:29,469
"you got rocks in your head."

330
00:24:29,552 --> 00:24:32,013
But now that I'm 11
and three quarters,

331
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,223
it makes a lot more sense.

332
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,934
All right, who let the kid in?

333
00:24:37,018 --> 00:24:39,145
I thought he was a tiny man.

334
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:41,397
What's wrong with you?

335
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:46,653
You seriously think a puny
little child can be a villain?

336
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:50,448
Um, yes. I am pretty despicable.

337
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:52,367
You don't want to cross me.

338
00:24:52,909 --> 00:24:55,620
Evil is for adults

339
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:59,582
who steal powerful ancient
stones and wreak havoc.

340
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,586
And not for tubby little punks

341
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:07,173
who should be
at school, learning,

342
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,175
taking a recess,

343
00:25:09,258 --> 00:25:10,802
sucking his thumb.

344
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:12,762
"Sucking his..."

345
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:17,642
Come back when you've done
something to impress me.

346
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,602
Who's next?

347
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:25,358
I am wing man, the next
member of the viciouso.

348
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:28,820
Behold, the power of flight!

349
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,783
All right, joke's over.

350
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:35,159
Showtime.

351
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:40,331
This is a big one.

352
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:45,503
Yeah, yeah. To the left.
That's right.

353
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:04,217
Bring him in,
bring him in, boys.

354
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,399
Everybody pile on!

355
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:10,194
He took the stone!

356
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,863
I'll get him!

357
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,162
Lock down the building.

358
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:26,753
What?

359
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:31,591
Nothing to see here.

360
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:32,967
Look at you.

361
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:36,179
Frampton comes alive!
Nice choice.

362
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,185
Just keep walking.

363
00:26:51,486 --> 00:26:53,571
Who the heck is that? A kid?

364
00:26:56,783 --> 00:26:58,409
Oh, guys. Bello.

365
00:26:58,493 --> 00:26:59,577
Mini-boss!

366
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,454
What are you doing here?

367
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,624
Okay, just get on.

368
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,877
Which way did he go?
There's that little thief!

369
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,212
Go! Go, go, go!

370
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,047
Split up!

371
00:27:26,896 --> 00:27:28,523
Knock, knock. Delivery.

372
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,079
That demon child!

373
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,790
Otto, take the stone back
to the lair. I'll distract them.

374
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,500
Go! Go, go, go!

375
00:27:57,009 --> 00:27:58,302
Ugh, not now.

376
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,304
Come on, come on!

377
00:28:19,282 --> 00:28:20,658
Yeah, baby.

378
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:25,496
I'll handle this.

379
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,463
Hope you enjoy
the rest of your short life.

380
00:28:35,298 --> 00:28:37,758
Please work.
Come on, come on, come on!

381
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:53,482
We're coming for you, tiny man.

382
00:28:54,734 --> 00:28:55,985
Yeah! Yeah!

383
00:29:01,532 --> 00:29:03,492
Josh, pump it up.

384
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,619
Up, up, up!

385
00:29:04,744 --> 00:29:06,913
All the young dudes

386
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,372
hey, dudes!

387
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:10,166
Carry the news...

388
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:14,045
They all said the kid couldn't
be a real villain.

389
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:15,504
Well...

390
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,382
This kid just stole something

391
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,802
from the worst villains
in the world.

392
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,016
When I bring it back to them,
they are going to say,

393
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:31,228
"We have made
a terrible mistake."

394
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,731
"Please join us. Please, gru."

395
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:36,192
And I will say, "yes!"

396
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:40,488
"I will be the newest member
of the vicious6."

397
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:43,616
Now all I need is Otto.

398
00:29:43,699 --> 00:29:44,992
Where is Otto?

399
00:29:45,409 --> 00:29:46,452
Otto le come-ay.

400
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:48,037
No, not "Otto le come-ay."

401
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,830
He needs to "come-ay" now.

402
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,504
Otto! Mini-boss!

403
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,631
There you are.

404
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:00,967
Oh, you got it?

405
00:30:05,096 --> 00:30:08,432
Is this... are you pulling
on my legs right now?

406
00:30:08,516 --> 00:30:10,643
Otto, where is the stone?

407
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:32,248
Over there.

408
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,253
Oh, no!

409
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,660
I love you.

410
00:31:25,509 --> 00:31:29,513
Did you just trade my future

411
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:31,515
for a pet rock?

412
00:31:32,767 --> 00:31:33,809
Si?

413
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:38,022
Oh... okay. Otto, where was
this birthday party?

414
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,071
This is unacceptable.
Unacceptable!

415
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:48,866
I told you guys that you
weren't ready for the big leagues,

416
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,576
and you have proven me correct.

417
00:31:52,453 --> 00:31:54,830
All you do
is mess everything up.

418
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:57,249
Up? Pump it up!

419
00:31:57,374 --> 00:31:58,876
Do a little dance
make a little love.

420
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,092
My mom was right.

421
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:08,135
You do not belong here.

422
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:10,096
You're fired!

423
00:32:12,765 --> 00:32:14,850
I'm going to find that stone.

424
00:32:14,934 --> 00:32:17,436
When I get home,
you all better be gone.

425
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,800
Mini-boss...

426
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:21,440
And, Otto, close your yapper!

427
00:32:24,652 --> 00:32:25,986
Josh.

428
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,488
Si, si.

429
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:31,534
I'll say goodbye to love

430
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:35,913
no one ever cared
if I should live or die

431
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:38,499
gru.
Por favor. Por favor.

432
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:40,543
Time and time again

433
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:41,877
Kevin, no.

434
00:32:41,961 --> 00:32:44,130
I will be better off on my own.

435
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:49,093
And all I know of love is
how to live without it

436
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:53,055
I just can't seem to find it

437
00:32:54,515 --> 00:32:56,475
so I've made my mind up

438
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:59,770
I must live my life alone

439
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:05,693
and though it's not the easy
way I guess I've always known

440
00:33:05,776 --> 00:33:09,655
I'd say goodbye to love

441
00:33:10,281 --> 00:33:16,036
there are no tomorrows
for this heart of mine

442
00:33:17,163 --> 00:33:19,290
surely time will lose
these bitter memories.

443
00:33:20,791 --> 00:33:22,751
And I'll find that there is

444
00:33:22,877 --> 00:33:27,256
someone to believe in
and to live for

445
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,133
mini-boss!

446
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:32,553
Oh, no.

447
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:38,350
I'm sorry. I thought
you'd be impressed.

448
00:33:38,434 --> 00:33:40,769
Could I just speak
to belle bottom? She'll...

449
00:33:46,984 --> 00:33:49,195
Wild knuckles!

450
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,322
You're alive?

451
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:55,492
Wow, my favorite villain
is also my kidnapper?

452
00:33:55,576 --> 00:33:59,038
This could be a great
opportunity if you don't kill me.

453
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,873
Shut up and give me the stone.

454
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,667
Oh, yes, the stone.

455
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:06,003
Here's the thing about that.

456
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,421
Kind of a funny story.

457
00:34:07,504 --> 00:34:08,714
Give it to him!

458
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,638
And it's all going to go south

459
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,015
very quickly.

460
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:22,269
What the heck is this?

461
00:34:37,826 --> 00:34:39,245
Where is it, boy?

462
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:41,747
I don't have it!
I don't have it!

463
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:43,249
I know you're
hiding it somewhere.

464
00:34:43,332 --> 00:34:44,959
I'm not. I'm not. I swear.

465
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:47,670
Cross my heart and hope to
die, stick a needle in my eye.

466
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,088
Don't actually do that, though.

467
00:34:49,171 --> 00:34:50,756
Somebody bring me a phone.

468
00:34:53,968 --> 00:34:55,261
Call home.

469
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:56,679
It's ransom time.

470
00:34:56,762 --> 00:35:00,474
No, no, no. My mom will
probably pay you to keep me!

471
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:03,686
Good one. Call!

472
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:25,958
La telefono.

473
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:39,305
Bello. La casa de mini-boss.

474
00:35:39,388 --> 00:35:40,723
Who is this? Kevin.

475
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:41,932
Kevin, le Minion.

476
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:43,350
"Kevin ie" what?

477
00:35:43,434 --> 00:35:45,227
Le Minion. You kidding me?

478
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:46,770
You got henchmen?

479
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:50,024
Well, that's the end of that.
Mini-boss?

480
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:53,235
Listen, you, bring the stone
to me in San Francisco.

481
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:56,155
6830 green street. Got it?

482
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,366
Now, you got two days,
or you are never going to see

483
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,327
your little boss again.

484
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,038
Bello? Bello.

485
00:36:07,416 --> 00:36:08,417
Otto...

486
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,177
Ah, okay, okay, okay.

487
00:36:20,971 --> 00:36:22,639
No.

488
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,606
Otto...

489
00:36:31,357 --> 00:36:32,649
Okay. Si, si.

490
00:36:41,617 --> 00:36:43,869
Hey, ho, let's go

491
00:36:44,244 --> 00:36:45,412
hey, ho

492
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:47,706
Otto...

493
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:49,750
Okay. Go, go, go.

494
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,460
They're going through
a tight wind

495
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,879
the kids are losing their minds

496
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:55,506
the blitzkrieg bop

497
00:36:57,007 --> 00:36:58,842
oh, the stone!

498
00:37:00,886 --> 00:37:03,722
Gave that to my uncle.
It's more his style.

499
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,352
Oh!

500
00:37:16,819 --> 00:37:19,029
La... la... la stone-a!

501
00:37:19,113 --> 00:37:20,280
Kevin! Kevin!

502
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:26,745
La stone-a!

503
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,749
I told you.

504
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:33,752
I don't know where he went,
you stupid twinkies.

505
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,593
Okay.

506
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,263
Pank you. Bye-bye.

507
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,476
Oh, not cool, man.

508
00:38:01,363 --> 00:38:02,656
San pan-pisco.

509
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,215
Let's rock and roll.

510
00:38:20,299 --> 00:38:21,925
Time to get our stone back.

511
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,720
We're coming for you, Mr. Gru.

512
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:26,555
Hallelujah!

513
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,442
Smash! Smash!

514
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,001
Whoo-hoo!

515
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:02,132
Flight
1109 will now depart at gate 278.

516
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:03,967
Bello.

517
00:39:06,428 --> 00:39:08,347
San Francisco? Okay.

518
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:09,515
How will you be paying?

519
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:12,267
No problemo.

520
00:39:13,602 --> 00:39:14,853
Oh, great.

521
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:18,524
You know, if you have any hair
balls, we can upgrade you to first class.

522
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:20,442
Get out.

523
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,701
So there I was. We
lost thrust in both engines,

524
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:31,745
and I had to turn back
at laguardia.

525
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:34,790
Ooh-ia-la.

526
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:36,416
Hey, Sally. Hey.

527
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:45,467
I wanna fly like an eagle

528
00:39:46,301 --> 00:39:48,387
to the sea

529
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:50,264
fly like an eagle...

530
00:39:51,181 --> 00:39:52,224
Okay. Vamos.

531
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,030
Bello. Peanut?

532
00:40:07,114 --> 00:40:08,115
Oh, yes, please.

533
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:12,202
Peanut

534
00:40:12,828 --> 00:40:14,037
peanut

535
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,331
peanut? Peanut.

536
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:17,749
Peanut?

537
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:19,376
Hey, baby, peanut?

538
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:20,562
Oh, bello!

539
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,105
Bello.

540
00:41:43,043 --> 00:41:44,336
You see me, you see me not.

541
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:46,004
You see me, you see me not.

542
00:42:05,273 --> 00:42:06,316
Whoo-hoo!

543
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,486
No. No "ha-ha."

544
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:15,951
You got real moxie, kid,
stealing from the viciouso.

545
00:42:16,034 --> 00:42:18,120
I got moxie, really?

546
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:21,164
Did I just receive a
compliment from wild knuckles?

547
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,459
Oh, all my dreams
are coming true right now!

548
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:27,170
Well, it's about to
become your nightmare.

549
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,673
Welcome to my newest
torture device,

550
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:32,134
the disco inferno.

551
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:39,558
Your minions better get here
by sundown tomorrow,

552
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:42,644
because if 48 hours of disco
don't kill you...

553
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:44,730
The blade will.

554
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:47,816
No, no, no, no, no!

555
00:43:00,036 --> 00:43:01,246
Stone-a! Stone-a!

556
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,665
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

557
00:43:03,749 --> 00:43:04,791
Stone-a!

558
00:43:06,168 --> 00:43:07,502
Stone-a! Stone-a!

559
00:43:09,296 --> 00:43:11,715
Stone-a! Stone-a! Stone-a!

560
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:13,508
Stone-a! Stone-a! Hey!

561
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:15,302
Stone-a! Stone-a!

562
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,891
Stone-a! Stone-a!

563
00:43:20,974 --> 00:43:23,393
Stone-a! Stone-a...

564
00:43:30,817 --> 00:43:33,904
Look-a the map-a.

565
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:35,071
Gru...

566
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:47,834
Bob!

567
00:43:54,424 --> 00:43:56,468
Bello!

568
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:06,978
Next stop, green street.

569
00:44:08,563 --> 00:44:09,606
Bye-bye.

570
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:14,986
Hey, hey. Look-a.

571
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:21,201
Come-ay! Come-ay!

572
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,670
More, more, more.

573
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:32,879
Mini-boss.

574
00:44:39,386 --> 00:44:40,762
Stuart.

575
00:44:42,347 --> 00:44:43,849
Mini-boss. No, no, no.

576
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:45,600
Okay, okay.

577
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:08,039
Okay. Go, go, go.

578
00:45:13,503 --> 00:45:14,880
Hey. Go, go, go.

579
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,720
Hey, wait a minute.

580
00:45:22,804 --> 00:45:23,889
Bello.

581
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,390
Oh, no! Bob!

582
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,732
Trespassers! Get 'em!

583
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:35,150
Hey, you. Come back here!

584
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:39,321
Go, go!

585
00:45:49,164 --> 00:45:51,249
Kevin! Oh, okay.

586
00:46:10,143 --> 00:46:11,728
Get your little butts back here!

587
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:22,197
Okay, now, you might feel
a little pinch.

588
00:46:29,204 --> 00:46:30,205
Got you now.

589
00:46:30,664 --> 00:46:33,625
Time to break some bones.

590
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:42,300
Any plans for the weekend?

591
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:51,184
Take five deep breaths.

592
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,727
I'll be right back.

593
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:55,730
Hey!

594
00:46:55,814 --> 00:46:58,316
You like picking on
little guys, huh?

595
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,818
Go take a nap, old lady.

596
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,320
Old lady?

597
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:09,703
Hi-ya!

598
00:47:11,663 --> 00:47:15,583
I am a master of the ancient
Shaolin art of kung fu.

599
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,515
Huh?

600
00:47:36,104 --> 00:47:37,439
Ha!

601
00:47:47,949 --> 00:47:49,325
Get lost!

602
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:56,875
If you come back to our place,
you're dead.

603
00:47:57,542 --> 00:47:59,627
Come-ay.

604
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:04,049
Pank you.

605
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,133
Pank you...

606
00:48:06,092 --> 00:48:09,721
Shh, shh, shh. You can
thank me by going away.

607
00:48:09,804 --> 00:48:11,056
I'm working.

608
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:13,641
Kung fu...

609
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:16,061
You want to learn kung fu?

610
00:48:17,312 --> 00:48:18,396
Ah, Kevin.

611
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:20,940
Bello, chica.

612
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:23,526
Kung fu por smoochie, smoochie?

613
00:48:23,943 --> 00:48:25,445
Hmm, hmm?

614
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:32,619
My teaching days are over.

615
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:34,996
This is my life now.

616
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:43,088
Kung fu para...
Para save-a le mini-boss.

617
00:48:43,797 --> 00:48:44,964
Por favor.

618
00:48:52,514 --> 00:48:54,682
Ay-ya. Fine.

619
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,267
I will teach you.

620
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:04,234
Those are not for you.
Excuse-a, excuse-a.

621
00:49:04,317 --> 00:49:07,320
The name of the game is sell,
sell, sell!

622
00:49:21,543 --> 00:49:22,710
What?

623
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,305
Where's gru?

624
00:49:34,430 --> 00:49:35,890
Ah, how should I know?

625
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,267
What's with the costumes?

626
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:40,145
Halloween was four months ago.
You look stupid.

627
00:49:40,228 --> 00:49:42,063
Buzz off. Shoo!

628
00:49:42,522 --> 00:49:44,732
I'm getting my meat tenderizer.

629
00:49:44,816 --> 00:49:46,609
Let me help you
with that, dearie.

630
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,654
Don't touch me.
Now, where's the boy?

631
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,159
Oh, I didn't mean to scare you.

632
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:57,036
Don't worry.
We're not mad at him.

633
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,580
We just want to...

634
00:49:59,205 --> 00:50:00,582
Hire him.

635
00:50:03,334 --> 00:50:04,669
Where is he?

636
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:07,297
Wild knuckles, San pan-pisco.

637
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,007
Wild knuckles is alive?

638
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,801
And working with the kid. Hmm.

639
00:50:11,926 --> 00:50:14,262
We're going to San Francisco.

640
00:50:14,387 --> 00:50:15,972
Let's hit it.

641
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:24,522
You had better be paying
for my roof.

642
00:50:24,647 --> 00:50:26,274
Ay-yi-yi.

643
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:31,613
Pretty groovy, huh?

644
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:39,162
We begin with a basic kick.

645
00:50:39,704 --> 00:50:41,623
Now you.

646
00:50:45,752 --> 00:50:47,295
Okay.

647
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,379
No kicking.

648
00:50:48,755 --> 00:50:51,299
This is a melon hammer.
It's a weapon.

649
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,968
This is Fred. He is a dummy.

650
00:50:54,344 --> 00:50:56,804
Never underestimate a dummy.

651
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,182
Ha. Dummy. Bello, Fred.

652
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:00,266
Now attack!

653
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:11,319
Stuart! Stuart! Woo-hoo!

654
00:51:21,788 --> 00:51:22,789
Fred.

655
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,668
Doubt tells me I cannot break
this wood.

656
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:30,463
But doubt exists only
in the mind.

657
00:51:30,546 --> 00:51:32,882
You know what I say to my mind?

658
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:37,011
Now you.

659
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:49,148
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin.

660
00:52:06,874 --> 00:52:10,461
Okay. Clearly, we are not
ready for philosophy.

661
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:11,921
Let's just train.

662
00:52:23,057 --> 00:52:26,269
A-won't you take me to funky town.

663
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:29,188
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Okay, okay, okay.

664
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:33,568
Ya... ya... ya...

665
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,753
Yeah!

666
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,321
Town won't you take me to

667
00:52:36,404 --> 00:52:37,447
yeah!

668
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:49,667
Rest up.

669
00:52:49,751 --> 00:52:53,046
Tomorrow's going to be
even worse.

670
00:52:54,297 --> 00:52:55,733
What, you're quitting?

671
00:52:55,757 --> 00:52:59,510
I told you, when I get that stone,
we're gonna be unstoppable.

672
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:01,262
I have had enough!

673
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:03,848
There's nothing sadder
than an aging villain.

674
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:05,683
So long, old man!

675
00:53:05,767 --> 00:53:08,186
Guys, come on. We're a team.

676
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,985
More, more, more

677
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:17,070
how do you like...

678
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:19,447
How do you like it?

679
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:20,531
How do you like...

680
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:23,201
Is this heaven?

681
00:53:23,284 --> 00:53:25,161
I just had to fire my henchmen.

682
00:53:25,244 --> 00:53:28,456
You know why? 'Cause they
weren't getting the job done.

683
00:53:28,915 --> 00:53:31,876
Okay, I'm just gonna untie you
now because I...

684
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:34,962
I need you to do some stuff
for me around the house.

685
00:53:35,463 --> 00:53:38,508
And it might be, you know,
kind of nice to have

686
00:53:38,591 --> 00:53:40,009
a little company around here.

687
00:53:40,676 --> 00:53:44,972
Oh, yeah. Two villains just
doing some chores.

688
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:47,558
Who knows what kind of trouble
we could get into?

689
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,896
What's that?
That's your evil chuckle?

690
00:53:51,979 --> 00:53:54,607
Obviously. Well, it stinks.

691
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,943
You sound like a clown
who swallowed a kazoo.

692
00:53:57,026 --> 00:54:01,280
Really? Well, you look like a wizard
going through an end-of—life crisis.

693
00:54:01,406 --> 00:54:04,117
Easy there, Don rickles.

694
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:05,868
Who's Don rickles?

695
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,540
Stone-a.

696
00:54:11,499 --> 00:54:13,626
Stone-a.

697
00:54:16,337 --> 00:54:18,256
Stone-a!

698
00:54:21,050 --> 00:54:23,386
Stone-a...

699
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:30,059
Dude.

700
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,019
I thought we lost you
there for a minute.

701
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,647
Hey, chi”, chi”, chi”...

702
00:54:35,857 --> 00:54:37,942
Hey, you want to try this on,
little dude?

703
00:54:39,277 --> 00:54:40,736
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

704
00:54:41,237 --> 00:54:42,613
La stone-a!

705
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:45,908
Hey, hey, hey, soul brother,
where you jettin' off to?

706
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,910
San pan-pisco.

707
00:54:47,994 --> 00:54:49,912
Frisco disco!

708
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:52,915
It's your lucky day, kid.
I'm headed up the coast.

709
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,542
I could drop you off on the way.

710
00:54:55,543 --> 00:54:58,129
Yee-haw!

711
00:55:04,844 --> 00:55:06,137
Ia stone-a!

712
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,638
Oh, look-a!

713
00:55:13,269 --> 00:55:15,688
Hey.

714
00:55:24,405 --> 00:55:25,781
Hey, yo, hermano!

715
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:42,965
Start with the pool.

716
00:55:43,049 --> 00:55:44,717
This place has got to be
spick-and-span.

717
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,801
What are you doing?

718
00:55:45,885 --> 00:55:49,388
You look like the overcooked Turkey
my mom makes on Thanksgiving.

719
00:55:50,723 --> 00:55:52,517
Oh, god.

720
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:55,019
Oh, yeah. I forgot to mention,

721
00:55:55,102 --> 00:55:58,272
the pool is filled
with my pet crocodiles.

722
00:56:00,733 --> 00:56:03,277
Yeah, well, well,
doesn't scare me.

723
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:08,282
Be careful. I can't have you
lose an arm,

724
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:11,035
because I need you to change
some light bulbs after this.

725
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,871
Here, let me show you
how it's done.

726
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:17,750
Betsy, knock it off.

727
00:56:20,378 --> 00:56:21,921
Oh, no.

728
00:56:25,091 --> 00:56:27,176
Marvin, no, no. Stop that.

729
00:56:29,011 --> 00:56:30,721
Help! Oh, no.

730
00:56:30,805 --> 00:56:32,265
The net!

731
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:36,060
I got you! Lgotyou!

732
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,688
I don't got you.

733
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,401
Take my hand.

734
00:56:46,279 --> 00:56:47,363
I got you!

735
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:57,123
Vvhoa.vvhoa.

736
00:56:57,665 --> 00:57:00,710
You could've run, but you,
but you didn't.

737
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:04,714
I told you, you are my
favorite villain in the world.

738
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:08,050
I could not let you
get eaten by crocodiles.

739
00:57:08,593 --> 00:57:11,012
Even though that would've been
kind of cool to watch.

740
00:57:11,929 --> 00:57:15,266
So... so you want to be
a great villain, huh?

741
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,436
That's all I ever wanted.

742
00:57:18,519 --> 00:57:20,605
You want... I don't know, you
want me...

743
00:57:21,188 --> 00:57:23,608
You want me to teach you
a thing or two?

744
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,318
Mmm-hmm!

745
00:57:26,277 --> 00:57:29,655
Many fighters have asked me,

746
00:57:29,739 --> 00:57:33,242
how did I become a great master?

747
00:57:33,326 --> 00:57:34,577
Hey, look-a!

748
00:57:44,754 --> 00:57:49,133
Even the smallest of us
are capable of great things.

749
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,469
You just dig down deep,

750
00:57:51,552 --> 00:57:54,472
find your inner beast, and...

751
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:01,854
Gesundheit?

752
00:58:02,396 --> 00:58:03,898
Now you try.

753
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:22,166
Find your inner beast!

754
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,503
Stop this kick.

755
00:58:32,885 --> 00:58:35,096
We have a lot more work to do.

756
00:59:44,457 --> 00:59:48,377
Kevin, Stuart and Bob,
you are ready.

757
00:59:52,173 --> 00:59:53,632
No, no, no, no, no!

758
00:59:53,716 --> 00:59:56,927
Ready for your junior kung fu
achievement badges.

759
00:59:58,637 --> 00:59:59,805
They're dead.

760
01:00:05,352 --> 01:00:08,105
First rule of heists,
always stay in character.

761
01:00:08,189 --> 01:00:09,940
Got it, grandpa.

762
01:00:13,611 --> 01:00:15,362
Say, do you mind if we
use thejohn?

763
01:00:15,446 --> 01:00:18,699
Poindexter here can't
hold it in till we get home.

764
01:00:33,214 --> 01:00:35,466
The bank of evil.

765
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,270
It's showtime, kid.

766
01:00:48,354 --> 01:00:50,731
Follow my lead, and don't
forget your cue.

767
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:55,069
Hello. I... I just need
to cash this.

768
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:58,113
Wowie zowie! What a big bank.

769
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,825
How many security guards
are in here?

770
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:02,159
Who's this little guy?

771
01:01:02,243 --> 01:01:05,246
Well, that's my grandson,
who still has not learned

772
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:08,165
that children should be seen
and not heard.

773
01:01:08,332 --> 01:01:10,042
Kids.

774
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:12,086
I actually have a son of my own.

775
01:01:12,878 --> 01:01:14,463
Ugh. He looks weird.

776
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:16,382
Oh, ho-ho! Don't listen to him.

777
01:01:16,465 --> 01:01:19,385
Your son is very, uh... cute.

778
01:01:21,428 --> 01:01:23,973
Oh, no!

779
01:01:25,641 --> 01:01:28,519
Oh, help! I'm seeing
a white light.

780
01:01:28,602 --> 01:01:31,647
Helen, I'm coming for ya!

781
01:01:34,316 --> 01:01:36,819
Helen, I'm coming for ya.

782
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:38,195
Oh. Help!

783
01:01:38,445 --> 01:01:41,115
Help my pop-pop!

784
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:43,367
Somebody help him!

785
01:01:45,035 --> 01:01:46,287
My grandpa!

786
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:47,538
We need a doctor!

787
01:01:47,997 --> 01:01:49,790
This is the big one.

788
01:01:53,586 --> 01:01:55,045
You hear that?

789
01:01:55,129 --> 01:01:57,298
It's the sweet sound of angels.

790
01:01:58,757 --> 01:01:59,842
Help!

791
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:01,886
Do something!

792
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:04,305
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

793
01:02:17,359 --> 01:02:19,194
No, no, no. The other way.

794
01:02:19,278 --> 01:02:20,321
The other way.

795
01:02:24,658 --> 01:02:26,493
All right, everyone stand back.

796
01:02:27,036 --> 01:02:28,329
Uh-oh.

797
01:02:28,412 --> 01:02:29,955
Clear! No, wait a minute. Wait.

798
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,919
Don't give up on me now, buddy.

799
01:02:35,002 --> 01:02:36,712
No, no, no, I'm feeling better.

800
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:37,880
Clear!

801
01:02:39,840 --> 01:02:41,383
Maximum charge.

802
01:02:41,467 --> 01:02:43,177
Clear! Thank you.

803
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:45,304
You saved my grandpa.

804
01:02:46,472 --> 01:02:48,641
Did we... did we do the heist?

805
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,977
Grandpas say
the darndest things.

806
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:54,021
You dropped these.

807
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:00,069
Look what I got!

808
01:03:00,152 --> 01:03:02,112
Hey. Not bad.

809
01:03:02,196 --> 01:03:03,364
Not bad at all.

810
01:03:03,447 --> 01:03:04,990
We make a good team.

811
01:03:05,074 --> 01:03:06,283
We do?

812
01:03:06,367 --> 01:03:08,994
Oh, yeah. Hey,
we got to keep at it.

813
01:03:09,078 --> 01:03:10,847
Wait till you see
what I'm gonna teach you next.

814
01:03:10,871 --> 01:03:13,082
I cannot wait.

815
01:03:13,165 --> 01:03:15,167
Oh, this is gonna be fun.

816
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:45,698
Hoo! Mini-boss!

817
01:03:45,781 --> 01:03:46,907
Okay, Stuart...

818
01:03:46,991 --> 01:03:48,071
Bob...

819
01:03:48,993 --> 01:03:50,244
Time to strike!

820
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,291
Mini-boss!

821
01:04:20,899 --> 01:04:23,485
They're not here.

822
01:04:23,569 --> 01:04:25,195
Fan out and find them.

823
01:04:41,670 --> 01:04:43,881
Something big's
going down in frisco.

824
01:04:44,006 --> 01:04:45,507
Oh! Look-a.

825
01:04:53,182 --> 01:04:55,350
Whoo, there it is.

826
01:04:59,438 --> 01:05:01,315
It's been one heck of a ride,
little man.

827
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:02,691
Oh, dude.

828
01:05:04,151 --> 01:05:05,569
You know, I'm gonna miss you.

829
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:09,698
Hey, soul brother, good luck!

830
01:05:27,299 --> 01:05:28,967
Ooh.

831
01:05:32,846 --> 01:05:36,350
My friend, you're now gonna
learn from the old school.

832
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:44,191
Oh, no.

833
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:04,044
I can't believe they
did this to me!

834
01:06:04,461 --> 01:06:07,339
I taught them everything
they know!

835
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:09,133
We were a team!

836
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,553
I give up.

837
01:06:15,681 --> 01:06:18,517
Hey, you are a great bad guy,

838
01:06:19,101 --> 01:06:20,853
and they are stupid idiots.

839
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,607
Only dream I ever had was
doing bad stuff with my buddies.

840
01:06:26,358 --> 01:06:29,486
Now look at me. Old, alone.

841
01:06:29,903 --> 01:06:32,656
Well, you are old,

842
01:06:32,739 --> 01:06:34,408
but you're not alone.

843
01:06:37,494 --> 01:06:38,495
All right.

844
01:06:38,871 --> 01:06:40,289
Listen up, buster.

845
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:43,167
We are starting a new team,

846
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:46,211
and it's going to be called
the terrible twos.

847
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,951
We can find a better name later,

848
01:06:49,006 --> 01:06:52,551
but right now
we're going to find that stone

849
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,470
and show everybody that you
still got it.

850
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,473
Come on.
You're just a little kid.

851
01:06:58,557 --> 01:07:01,018
It's over. Go home.

852
01:07:01,101 --> 01:07:03,312
But you said we... go home!

853
01:07:43,644 --> 01:07:45,187
Come on, come on. Let's go!

854
01:07:49,024 --> 01:07:50,567
Vvhoa, hey!

855
01:07:51,443 --> 01:07:52,444
Otto?

856
01:07:57,366 --> 01:07:58,408
Otto!

857
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,744
Yee-haw! Otto!

858
01:08:04,831 --> 01:08:07,376
Otto! It's mini-boss!

859
01:08:07,501 --> 01:08:09,086
Mini-boss!

860
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,590
Mini-boss! Otto!

861
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:16,927
Look-a! Look-a!

862
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,054
Stone-a.

863
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:21,223
You found the stone.

864
01:08:21,306 --> 01:08:23,225
Otto, I'm so proud of you.

865
01:08:25,644 --> 01:08:27,020
All right, we don't have
much time.

866
01:08:27,104 --> 01:08:28,744
We got to get this to
wild knuckles. Okay.

867
01:08:28,814 --> 01:08:30,232
Okay.

868
01:08:30,357 --> 01:08:31,483
Get him!

869
01:08:36,363 --> 01:08:38,865
Go, go, go!

870
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:44,621
Long time, no see, punk.

871
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:48,875
I'll take that.

872
01:08:53,297 --> 01:08:54,298
Yes!

873
01:08:55,924 --> 01:08:56,925
Don't move!

874
01:08:57,467 --> 01:08:58,635
Right there! Freeze!

875
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,053
Anti-villain league.

876
01:09:00,137 --> 01:09:01,972
You are under arrest.

877
01:09:02,556 --> 01:09:04,683
Oh, phew.

878
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:09,396
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Everybody.

879
01:09:09,479 --> 01:09:11,773
Did you forget what time it is?

880
01:09:25,579 --> 01:09:27,664
Happy new year!

881
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,212
Fire!

882
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:57,110
Stand your ground.

883
01:09:59,363 --> 01:10:00,614
Look out!

884
01:10:11,917 --> 01:10:13,627
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no,

885
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,045
no, no, no, no, no!

886
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:18,673
Where do you think
you're going? Hmm?

887
01:10:18,757 --> 01:10:22,677
You stole from us,
and now you're gonna pay!

888
01:10:29,309 --> 01:10:31,728
Enjoy being torn apart.

889
01:10:31,812 --> 01:10:34,022
Hey!
Mini-boss!

890
01:10:34,189 --> 01:10:35,190
Guys!

891
01:10:35,524 --> 01:10:38,944
Oh. Why don't we
make this a fair fight?

892
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,499
Oh, you thought I was serious.

893
01:10:52,666 --> 01:10:54,084
Run!

894
01:10:57,921 --> 01:10:59,798
No!

895
01:11:03,218 --> 01:11:04,678
Hello, traitors.

896
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:07,889
Remember me?

897
01:11:09,391 --> 01:11:10,767
You.

898
01:11:10,851 --> 01:11:14,396
You can leave me for dead,
you can destroy everything I own,

899
01:11:14,521 --> 01:11:17,441
but I will not let you
hurt that kid!

900
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,818
So you're gonna save the kid?

901
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,112
Yeah, you and what army?

902
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,948
This army!

903
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,033
Okay. This army.

904
01:12:29,095 --> 01:12:30,680
Dig down deep.

905
01:12:30,764 --> 01:12:33,308
Find your inner beast.

906
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:52,596
Otto!

907
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:55,307
Hurry! Faster!

908
01:14:07,527 --> 01:14:08,612
Got you.

909
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:14,284
Go, go, go!

910
01:14:23,793 --> 01:14:25,211
Ha-ha!

911
01:14:26,379 --> 01:14:27,547
No.

912
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:38,892
Get away from him!

913
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,477
Destroy the kid.

914
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,655
Oh!

915
01:15:02,582 --> 01:15:07,128
Hey, hey. How does it feel to
be beaten by a tubby little punk?

916
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:13,927
You guys were amazing!

917
01:15:14,010 --> 01:15:16,680
The kung fu...
Where did that come from?

918
01:15:16,763 --> 01:15:19,265
Obviously, you guys are rehired.

919
01:15:22,602 --> 01:15:24,604
Stuart!

920
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:45,333
It's all yours, sir.

921
01:15:45,417 --> 01:15:46,960
Where do you want it?

922
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,837
Can you feel this, sir?
Right here.

923
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:52,924
Oh, no. Wild knuckles.

924
01:15:56,469 --> 01:15:57,595
Hey.

925
01:15:57,679 --> 01:15:59,639
You're gonna be okay, right?

926
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,433
Don't worry about me, kid.

927
01:16:01,933 --> 01:16:03,226
I'll be fine.

928
01:16:03,852 --> 01:16:04,936
Finally.

929
01:16:05,019 --> 01:16:08,398
You're going away for a long,
long time.

930
01:16:08,481 --> 01:16:11,276
Yeah, well,
I wouldn't bet on it.

931
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:15,739
See you soon, kiddo.

932
01:16:51,441 --> 01:16:54,611
Wild knuckles
was my favorite villain.

933
01:16:56,029 --> 01:16:59,073
We didn't have
much time together,

934
01:16:59,157 --> 01:17:00,950
but the time we did have,

935
01:17:01,659 --> 01:17:03,369
I'm so grateful for.

936
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:07,457
I've been thinking about
how you won't see me grow up

937
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:11,878
or be there for all the terrible
things that I'm going to do.

938
01:17:11,961 --> 01:17:16,090
And believe me, there are gonna
be some awful things.

939
01:17:24,516 --> 01:17:25,767
Ahem.

940
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,311
But I'm going to make you proud.

941
01:17:28,394 --> 01:17:33,107
I'm going to be the best
villain ever because of you.

942
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:37,028
Because you taught me
what matters.

943
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,656
You can't do anything alone.

944
01:17:41,407 --> 01:17:42,992
Find your tribe,

945
01:17:43,701 --> 01:17:46,996
and never, ever let them go.

946
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:49,123
Otto?

947
01:18:34,627 --> 01:18:37,046
You better
stay out of trouble, kid.

948
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:41,467
I will lead
a good and honest life.

949
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,388
You're alive?

950
01:18:45,763 --> 01:18:46,931
Oh!

951
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:50,602
You just blew my mind.

952
01:18:50,685 --> 01:18:52,729
How did you do that?

953
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:57,400
I cannot wait to fake my own
death to avoid the authorities.

954
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:59,152
Shoot for the moon, kid.

955
01:18:59,235 --> 01:19:00,486
Shoot for the moon.

956
01:19:01,905 --> 01:19:04,782
See you later, suckers!

957
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:10,371
You can't always get
what you want

958
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:14,167
you can't always get
what you want

959
01:19:15,627 --> 01:19:19,297
you can't always get
what you want

960
01:19:20,757 --> 01:19:22,425
but if you try sometime

961
01:19:22,550 --> 01:19:25,386
you just might find
you just might find

962
01:19:25,511 --> 01:19:27,889
you get what you need

963
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:29,849
ah, yeah

964
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,309
ah, yeah.

965
01:19:36,356 --> 01:19:38,066
Sorry, we're closed.

966
01:19:38,232 --> 01:19:39,567
Oh!

967
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:42,487
I just wanted
to thank you for this.

968
01:19:42,570 --> 01:19:44,405
Worked like a charm.

969
01:19:44,530 --> 01:19:46,532
All right, let me
out to the chase here.

970
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:48,826
I need a genius mad scientist.

971
01:19:48,910 --> 01:19:50,328
You want to come work for me?

972
01:19:50,411 --> 01:19:52,538
No, I am done with villainy.

973
01:19:52,664 --> 01:19:54,874
Off to happier horizons.

974
01:19:55,667 --> 01:19:57,126
Goodbye, little chap.

975
01:19:58,002 --> 01:19:59,170
Por favor.

976
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:12,225
Oh, all right, all right.

977
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:14,394
Fine. Stop with the face.

978
01:20:14,477 --> 01:20:15,561
I'm in.

979
01:20:16,312 --> 01:20:18,272
Want to see something cool?

980
01:20:25,405 --> 01:20:27,782
Oh, are you kidding me?

981
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:38,418
Big boss! Big boss!
Big boss! Big boss!

982
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:40,503
"Big boss." I like that.

983
01:20:45,049 --> 01:20:46,592
We can make it further

984
01:20:46,718 --> 01:20:49,262
we running and don't look back

985
01:20:49,387 --> 01:20:51,389
it's a light at the end
of the tunnel

986
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:53,891
if you stay on track

987
01:20:54,017 --> 01:20:57,186
but I know any minute when
your fingers turn it up like snap

988
01:20:57,311 --> 01:20:59,313
so hard to lose like that

989
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:00,815
hey, let's do it

990
01:21:00,940 --> 01:21:04,235
all around the world

991
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:06,279
we gotta turn up the sunshine

992
01:21:06,404 --> 01:21:08,614
we gotta turn up the sunshine

993
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:09,824
think about it

994
01:21:09,949 --> 01:21:12,869
all the boys and girls

995
01:21:12,994 --> 01:21:15,163
you gotta turn up the sunshine

996
01:21:15,288 --> 01:21:17,373
you gotta turn up the sunshine

997
01:21:17,498 --> 01:21:21,753
said it's been a
long night, long night

998
01:21:21,878 --> 01:21:25,590
waiting for the light
waiting for the light

999
01:21:25,715 --> 01:21:27,133
let's do it

1000
01:21:27,258 --> 01:21:30,386
all around the world

1001
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:32,430
we gotta turn up the sunshine

1002
01:21:32,555 --> 01:21:34,182
we gotta turn it up

1003
01:21:34,307 --> 01:21:36,309

baby, you're no good

1093
01:27:21,305 --> 01:28:21,900
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
