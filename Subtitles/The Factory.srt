1
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,850
I don't think so.

2
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,690
Exactly.

3
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,260
Okay, I love you.

4
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,720
Well, hello handsome.

5
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,560
And since I just moved
here a couple of years ago,

6
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,730
I don't know too many folks,
It sure is nice to...

7
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,930
Have someone to share a Thanksgiving meal with.

8
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,870
I just love to cook.

9
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:24,310
Well whatever pulls your hair back
honey, you're paying.

10
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,040
So, what are you a doctor?

11
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,410
Because there's some fancy ass
medical books you got there.

12
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:32,140
No, I ...

13
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,150
I just work at Buffalo Regional.

14
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,420
Well ...

15
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:39,950
Why don't we play doctors and nurses when I
get back from the little girl's room?

16
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,650
Okay. Yeah.

17
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,760
It's down the hall on the end.

18
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,670
Are you ready for me, baby?

19
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,700
Don't be shy now.

20
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:45,210
This is so disappointing.

21
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,560
When were you going tell me, you have ...

22
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:59,700
I take you off the streets

23
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:05,430
and offer you the chance to create something,
rather than destroy it!

24
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:11,350
- And this is how you pay me in return?
- Please, I'll do anything you want!

25
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,380
No, no!

26
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:25,080
A committed relationship is
between a man and a woman.

27
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,630
How did you think this was ever
going to work out?

28
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,720
What are you talking about?

29
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,690
Come on ...

30
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,740
It's okay. I'm doing you a favor.

31
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,110
Do everyone a favor.

32
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:55,320
We're returning to the crime in a case that has puzzled
Buffalo law enforcement for the past 3 years.

33
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,020
Authorities this afternoon announced the closing down
of a once high profile investigation.

34
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,860
Which begun with the disappearance of
17 year old prostitute Lisa Donnelly.

35
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,270
Donnelly was the first of seven sex workers

36
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,160
to go missing from downtown Buffalo
over a three year period.

37
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:16,700
With all the alleged abductions taking place during
the winter months of November through March.

38
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:20,270
A nurse at Buffalo Regional hospital, Darrell Kennedy

39
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,280
was initially named by authorities
as a person of interest,

40
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,680
but was eventually cleared of all involvement.

41
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,580
While officials claim budget restraints
are forcing the allocation

42
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,020
of resources to other cases,
sources close to the investigation

43
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,300
blame the failure of detectives
to locate a body

44
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,670
It's bullshit cut and run politics Kelsey.

45
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,940
They're thinking shut this guy down
with a press conference.

46
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,240
Take a look out there.

47
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,510
Seven out of seven were taken in the snow.
Seven out of Seven.

48
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,090
-  Are you listening to me, or what?
- I'm not deaf, Mike.

49
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,220
You think these guys would be
shutting it down if it was their daughter?

50
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,760
I don't fucking think so.

51
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,760
- What, you're not going to fight this?
- Hey!

52
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,500
I was the dumbass who fought
to be on this case, remember?

53
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,930
What a great move that turned out to be.

54
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,770
Come on, it's Thanksgiving
for Christ's sake!

55
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,780
Be thankful.
Let it go for one night.

56
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:26,780
Hang with family, eat too much,
pass out on the couch, easy stuff.

57
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,680
What are you, my nanny?
My life coach?

58
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,310
There's alot you don't
know about me, detective.

59
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,290
Don't even think about it.

60
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,290
Abby would never forgive you
if you didn't come in.

61
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,930
We've got a ton of paperwork
to get done.

62
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,090
The sooner we get it done,
the sooner we can move on from this.

63
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,720
Will you listen to yourself?

64
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,730
You're obsessed.
You've got to let it go.

65
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,530
Come in for a drink.

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,170
Come on.
One drink going to kill you?

67
00:06:50,570 --> 00:06:53,010
There really is no point in even having
this discussion

68
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,800
because dinner is about
to be on the table.

69
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,770
So if you could just come and help me,
that would be great.

70
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,880
Mom, please.
Tad's whole family invited me over.

71
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,820
You're going to have to tell Tad's whole family

72
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,280
that you're spending Thanksgiving
with your own family.

73
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,480
Hey, surprise, surprise!

74
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,810
Hey!

75
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,050
This is a surprise.
Mike didn't tell me you were able to make it.

76
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,290
Who cares?
Finally somebody cool.

77
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,930
I'm not staying, I just wanted to come in
and say happy Thanksgiving.

78
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,570
Come on, relax.
There's plenty to go around, right Shelley?

79
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,370
Yes, you could have my plate,
because I'm having dinner at Tad's family.

80
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,030
You know what?
Enough, young lady, OK?

81
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,940
You're staying in, that's it. Final.

82
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,530
Even your dad managed to make the effort.

83
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,770
This is unbelievable.
Do you see what i have to deal with?

84
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:30,200
This is so fucked.

85
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,840
Now you're just showing off.
Could you go tell your brother to come?

86
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,050
- Could you?
- Yeah.

87
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,310
Make mine a large.

88
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,150
- Hey, sorry.
- No, don't worry about it.

89
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,090
You should see me at that age.

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,490
God, Dad.

91
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,260
I'm not hungry.

92
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,440
She's been cooking all day Abby,
don't be stupid.

93
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,760
It's like being under house arrest to live here.

94
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,570
Yeah, must be rough.

95
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:05,840
You haven't even been here
to see what a Nazi she's become.

96
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,080
Abby.

97
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:08,980
It's Thanksgiving.

98
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,280
Want to help me out here?

99
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,920
Come to dinner.

100
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,390
Look, why don't we go to White Face this weekend
make the most of the early snow?

101
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,260
You like the cabin, don't you?
It's fun. Remember last year?

102
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,870
Missed all that school because the...
the big dump?

103
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:30,940
Dad, no.

104
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,540
Look, I'll be out in a minute, okay?

105
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,240
Get your head together, please.

106
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:40,020
Don't be rude.

107
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,840
Come on.

108
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,060
You'd think with a scholarship to Cornell
wouldn't be a no-brainer, but no.

109
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,260
Now she's talking about going to
Buffalo State to be closer to Tad.

110
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,800
I don't know. First love.

111
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,370
I guess you got to let them get it
out of their system, right?

112
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,830
Wow, look at you guys.

113
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,830
When was this?
Have I seen this?

114
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,740
Yeah, it was a while ago ...

115
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,970
Look who we got here. Say hi to Kelsey.
He can't say "strawberry".

116
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,850
Wait a minute, you're not Jed!
You're too tall to be Jed.

117
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,980
I'm gonna put bricks on your head
to make you short again.

118
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,720
Last chance, Kelsie.
Want to stay for a drink ...

119
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,290
Michael, could you let the poor
girl go home already?

120
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,120
She's probably sick and tired of you.
Don't worry about it, Kelsie.

121
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,450
Here, I'll take that.

122
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,730
- Tell Abby I said goodbye.
- Yeah.

123
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,770
Jed, did you say goodbye?

124
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:32,730
- Bye!
- Have you said goodbye to Kelsie?

125
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,000
- Did you look her in the eye buddy?
- A Happy Thanksgiving!

126
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,230
Good job.

127
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,400
- Jed, you washed your hands?
- Yes.

128
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,430
This looks great.

129
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,780
You sure you can handle a family dinner
without your backup?

130
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,810
Come on, It's Thanksgiving.

131
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,450
She didn't have anybody in Buffalo.

132
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,780
She's supposed to be our friend, you know?

133
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,010
If she were a real friend you wouldn't force her
to work the same ridiculous hours as you.

134
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:57,690
That way she might actually have someone
to spend Thanksgiving with.

135
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,820
I mean, it's not sad enough she's a 30 year old woman
who can't have kids ...

136
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,990
You want to deprive her social life too?

137
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,170
I didn't forced her to do anything.
Kelsie is a big girl, she can look after herself.

138
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,930
Let me do that.
Don't tell your mom, just take a sip.

139
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:12,800
- Let me get that, please?
- Okay.

140
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,840
This looks great.

141
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:21,850
Look at this amazing job your mom did.

142
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:24,320
Allright, doesn't this look great?

143
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:52,010
Here, boy.

144
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,720
Jesus, Dad.
Is this cold enough in here for you?

145
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,220
It helps to keep me awake.

146
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:45,960
What's up kid?

147
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,530
Mom, would like you to come inside
so you can see Jed's costume

148
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:52,760
for his stupid thing.

149
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,810
Tell her I'll be in, In a minute.

150
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:58,000
He's playing a donkey and i was like,
Jed really need a costume for that?

151
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,850
Come on now ...

152
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,260
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

153
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,720
Why do you spend so much time here?

154
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,730
What is it with these girls?

155
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,330
Well, they got names.

156
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,800
This is Lisa Donnelly.
She grew up in Riverside.

157
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:27,230
She started working the streets when
she was younger than you.

158
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,210
She's been missing for two years.

159
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,810
She was gone three months
before anybody reported her gone.

160
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,080
And when they did, it wasn't her
mother or father or ...

161
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,820
... or brother, or sister.
It was her landlord looking for back rent.

162
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,950
So much for the city of good neighbors, huh?

163
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,950
All these girls ... It's all the same.

164
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,990
I never found a single body.

165
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,800
Now they're just missing girl,
that nobody missed.

166
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,130
That would be a horrible way to live, right?

167
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,150
Come here.

168
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,490
Leave me alone, I'll be in, In 10 minutes.

169
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:03,630
Happy Thanksgiving.

170
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,600
Okay, so here's what I don't understand.

171
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,240
If Divine was working at a
Girls Girls, Girls last night,

172
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,810
What was she doing curb crawling?

173
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,870
Come on man, she's not stupid.

174
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,780
She hasn't worked the streets since
they all started to go missing.

175
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,450
She was on her break,
getting money at the ATM for the drugs.

176
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,420
For the drugs, what kind of drugs?

177
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:54,810
HRT.

178
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,060
- What's HRT?
- Hormone Replacement Therapy.

179
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,850
She's a tranny?

180
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,360
She's a pre-op transsexual, allright?

181
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,700
She was going to take the next couple
of days off to rest up, you know?

182
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,240
Fuck! There were three days
away from surgery.

183
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,140
We are going to do our very best to find her
and we're going to call you as soon as we hear anything.

184
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,840
Okay?

185
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,520
We should be working on this thing
nonstop since I moved up here.

186
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:35,530
When people said you were reaching even
calling it a case I had your back, right?

187
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,460
But if we'd to go in from the D.A.
tomorrow, what do we really have?

188
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,530
Your intuition?

189
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,160
No bodies, no homicide, Mike.

190
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,410
God, I want this as bad as you do but there's dogged
and then there's just plain pig-headed

191
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,350
- Come on, she's a missing hooker.
- Who's been missing less than 12 hours.

192
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,880
She's probably in a bar somewhere about
to give some John the surprise of his life.

193
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,850
She was about to get that chopped,
you heard the boyfriend, right?

194
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,780
She was supposed to be at home,
In bed, resting.

195
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,720
What the fuck?
Are you with me on this or what?

196
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,050
Of course I'm with you.

197
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,690
I'm just saying what about the other
seven hookers who were all girls?

198
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,690
Biological girls.
Why would he change his M.O now?

199
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,200
You saw her pictures, she had me fooled.

200
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:14,160
Look, assume for a minute that I'm right.
Which you really should.

201
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,730
This fuck comes out of his cave
for the first time in ten months.

202
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,540
And he gets a chick with a dick.

203
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:22,300
You really think he's going back
into hibernation just yet?

204
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,240
This is it.

205
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,810
Girls, Girls, Girls.

206
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,050
I guess Divine had them all fooled too.

207
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:39,860
Hey Steve, It's Mike.
Need you to do me a favor.

208
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,260
Hey, this came through just now.

209
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,870
So there's Divine at the ATM.

210
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:51,970
Pick up perp might drive
a late 90's dark sedan?

211
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,900
Bring in Crystal, will you?

212
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,840
I want to find out what she saw last night.

213
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:15,760
Jesus.

214
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,890
D, you don't look so good.

215
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,260
No shit.

216
00:17:20,570 --> 00:17:23,090
It started, checking inventories
every week.

217
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,830
Whole joint is locked up like a
motherfucking Fort Knox.

218
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,070
Amazing what we can do
when we have to.

219
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,750
Carl man you are not listening.

220
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,480
The hospital called security
on the supply room.

221
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,450
I can't get shit now without there being
a link straight back to me.

222
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,720
Hey Darryl, do you want anything
special for Christmas?

223
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,750
You know what I want.

224
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,750
What the fuck is that?

225
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,730
You told me you're going
to get rid of that shit.

226
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,350
I guess I forgot.

227
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,200
I'll just skip to the money shot,
you know It's ...

228
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,970
I was amazed at the quality.
I mean ...

229
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,600
This is just a regular video phone but ...

230
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:06,780
Oh yeah, you can ... make out all the details.

231
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,810
It's not every day you get to
tap a hooker for free, right?

232
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,450
Why the fuck are you doing this?

233
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:21,890
I'm just trying to protect the partnership.

234
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,120
Come on Carl, man ...

235
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:24,890
We're not really partners, right?

236
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,600
I've never asked what you going to do
with all the shit I gave you.

237
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,800
That's your own personal shit
and I respect that.

238
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:38,140
Man look, you got me over
a barrel here, allright?

239
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,450
And you know that I ain't ever,
never going to talk about ...

240
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,670
... our little business here.

241
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,980
- But you got to understand, man ...
- I understand, man.

242
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:49,050
I understand that you raped a patient.

243
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:55,620
You got her pregnant and you asked me
to take care of it, which I did.

244
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,460
They give you the big needle
for that up here.

245
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,300
So, what I'm asking you ...
compared to what you asked of me?

246
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,110
Just think about it.

247
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,380
You stop own when I stop asking.

248
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:19,110
There are a couple more things that
I forgot to mention.

249
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,750
I'm going to need you ...

250
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:24,650
To pick those up too.

251
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,020
I'll come to you, just like the last time.

252
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,130
And D ...

253
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,730
Stop taking those pills, man.

254
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,760
You're going to give yourself
a heart attack.

255
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,530
Fuck you, buddy!
I heard that.

256
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,440
Hi, honey.

257
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:49,210
- Hey, Crystal.
- Hey.

258
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,880
How's it going?

259
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,450
Got down to 12 degrees last night.
How do you think It's going?

260
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,720
- You have a nice Thanksgiving?
- Yeah, it was great.

261
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:00,950
So much for showing this fucking
thing down, huh?

262
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,520
Yeah, can I get your list of plates
from last nght?

263
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,690
Yeah.

264
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,660
Every sorry son of a bitch to pass
from 6 untill 2 in the morning.

265
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,170
We're looking for a dark sedan.

266
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:11,960
We think our guy might be
back on the scene.

267
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,370
Spread the word out to the girls.

268
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:15,510
- They are already talking about it.
- Yeah?

269
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,870
It's fucked up.

270
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,610
Divine was a nice kid.

271
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,610
I'm gonna run these.

272
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,020
Okay, so ...
The first lucky guy of the night.

273
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,300
You want me to take this round?

274
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,300
Sure. I'll get the next.

275
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,970
Sweetie, would you go get your sister?
Tell her to come set the table.

276
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,940
Please tell me you're on your way home.

277
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,210
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I just caught up in here.

278
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,520
- Mom said you got to set the table.
- I'm on the phone!

279
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:39,090
Okay so, just come over when
you're done, Okay?

280
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,860
Why are you such a dick Tad?
Please!

281
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,300
Fine.

282
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:50,800
Mom's going to be angry!

283
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,770
She's out of control.
She won't let up about seeing tad tonight.

284
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,810
On weekends, remember?
On weekends, during the day?

285
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,950
Oh my God, like It's that easy Mike,
your child's in heat.

286
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,350
Can you talk to her?

287
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:03,320
Oh my God, what is wrong with you?
That's disgusting!

288
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:05,080
Come on Abby, come back here!

289
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:08,090
Jesus, did you hear it?
Could you talk to her, please?

290
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,620
Look, Shell, I'm just in the middle of this ...

291
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,520
I'm gonna to talk to her when I get back,
and just straighten it out, Okay?

292
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,530
Okay, your dinner is in the microwave.

293
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,660
Jesus Christ, that kid can fight.

294
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,300
I wonder where she gets that from.

295
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:29,570
Get ready to be happy.

296
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,650
So I run Crystal's plates through DMV
to cross check for dark sedans.

297
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:35,470
We came up with a couple dozen matches.

298
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:38,910
Just on a spec I run it through ViCAP
and sex offenders database.

299
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:40,820
How's this for a real charmer?

300
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:44,220
'97 arrested for holding a hooker at knife point,
that's two years.

301
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,650
2001 sentenced to ten for kidnap and stat rape.
Again, a hooker.

302
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,200
Paroled three years ago after
being repeatedly beaten inside.

303
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,130
And this is you closing the case down
how exactly?

304
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:58,760
Drive was the right car, he was in the area,
and he's been out since we lost the first girl.

305
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,800
With the snow and all the holiday weekend

306
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,340
only the most desperate
girls were on the streets.

307
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:05,740
Without witnesses.
That's his M.O.

308
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,340
The guy is a snow hunter.

309
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,440
It's the most we ever had.

310
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,210
And he's obviously got a thing for hookers.

311
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,050
Come on, throw us a bone.

312
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,660
last pool of the days kids.

313
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,700
Abby?

314
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,230
Okay, I'm gonna do the dishes.

315
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:35,440
If this music is still playing when i get back,
you're not seeing anyone this weekend, Okay?

316
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,770
Fine.

317
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:00,890
Would you like a refill?

318
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:02,540
Yeah.

319
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,000
Is that regular or diet?

320
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:06,300
What do you think?

321
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:39,040
- Your parents are going to freak.
- Tad, they'll never going to know.

322
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,900
I really needed to be with you.

323
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,470
Where you been, Carl?
You supposed to be at work.

324
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,220
What the fuck happened to your head?

325
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:52,810
You ought to get that shit looked at.

326
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,380
It's all here?

327
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,810
Yes.

328
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:07,260
I'll hang out here untill you close up and then
you can sneak back into my place, Okay?

329
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,000
You're not listening to me right now.

330
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:11,500
This isn't working Ab.

331
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,500
I'm sorry, I just think we got to take a break,
you know until we get a little longer.

332
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:22,140
- What?
- I think you're amazing.

333
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,480
And I love spending time with
you when we can but ...

334
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,910
I'm about to finish college.

335
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,820
You haven't even finished high school.

336
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,420
And the way your parents act ...

337
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,950
I can never forget that.

338
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:38,750
If you can't see past that then I guess
you're just as fucked up as they are, aren't you?

339
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:41,290
- Abby.
- Fuck you!

340
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,500
This is the last time, Carl.

341
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,380
Fuck this.

342
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,130
Hey there.

343
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,240
- A slow night?
- Fuck you asshole.

344
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:32,820
Are you new in town?
I haven't seen around.

345
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,950
You got a lighter I can use?

346
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,720
Yeah, sure.

347
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,530
Gee, you must be freezing out there.

348
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,520
- Good to roll Detective.
- Let's do it.

349
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,130
Blue team secure the perimeter.

350
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,900
Give me visual ID on the vehicle.

351
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,820
Looks like a dark blue Lincoln sedan.

352
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:11,720
Repeat, dark blue Sedan.

353
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,320
We're in Detective.

354
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:34,840
Secure downstairs, go, go!

355
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,280
Where you at Green? Over.

356
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:47,240
Accessing the basement.

357
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,760
What you got down there Green?
Talk to me.

358
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,000
Go, go!

359
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,100
Buffalo PD. Hands in the air.

360
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,000
Hands up, motherfucker!

361
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,370
Mike?
I don't think he can.

362
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:20,080
Basement is clean.
Repeat. Basement is clean.

363
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,380
We got nothing down here.

364
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,080
You got to be fucking kidding me.

365
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,260
I'm sorry I'm calling so
late and for disturbing your son.

366
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,170
- No plates. Do you believe this?
- That was his mother.

367
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,940
He's been like that since he got out of prison.
She's the only one who drives this.

368
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,030
I'm telling you, our guy knows how we work.

369
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,240
He didn't steal some sick fucking
pervert's license plates by chance.

370
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,840
- The fucker set us up.
- Who is this fucking guy?

371
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:48,480
He has access to DMV records?
What else does he have?

372
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,710
Yeah?

373
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,780
Shelley let me call you.
Calm down.

374
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,680
She what?

375
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:01,220
Allright let's try to be rational.
It's only been a few hours.

376
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:04,870
Could you stop acting like a fucking cop
and act like a father for one second?

377
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,690
Shelley listen, you guys had a fight.

378
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,940
She's probably at a girlfriend's house.

379
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,800
I'm sorry do you have kids?
What do you know?

380
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,000
I'll go get some tea.

381
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,200
Look, It's probably just a matter of a
couple of phone calls. Allright?

382
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,970
Help me out here.
Who did you call?

383
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,680
Come on, did you call the kid?
Did you call Tad?

384
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:27,010
Yeah, of course I called Tad.
He's at work, he hasn't seen her.

385
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,480
No one has seen her.

386
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,420
Look, It's Mike's daughter for God's sake!

387
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,550
I don't know.

388
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,360
Yeah well she's not just any
other girl, allright?

389
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,570
Look, just do what you have to do.

390
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,010
she goes out on weekends.
Of course she does.

391
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,440
- She didn't go to bars on her own.
- Of course she does.

392
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,110
She goes with friends, she goes with Tad.

393
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,450
- Did you call Sarah?
- I called Sarah, I called Rachel, I called rachel's mom.

394
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,980
What about that kid Evan
she used to hang out?

395
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,020
She hasn't seen her for years.
Her number is not even in the book.

396
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,440
I just phoned it through to Steve

397
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:06,520
Just in case, they'll need to know what she
was wearing before they can put out an APB.

398
00:31:18,270 --> 00:31:19,330
Drink some of this.

399
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,840
This here ring is a symbol of
our commitment to each other.

400
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,770
'Til death do us part.

401
00:32:05,650 --> 00:32:06,920
Come on, It's okay.

402
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,190
I got one just like it. See?

403
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,310
We all do.

404
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,700
Come on, It's picture time.

405
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,290
Welcome home.

406
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,520
We're checking her email,
her phone logs, her facebook page.

407
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:20,850
NCIC and the hospitals are all online.

408
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:24,090
I've requested CCTV footage from
all of the bus and train depots.

409
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,590
And our friends across the lake?

410
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:27,930
No, there's no record of her
crossing the border.

411
00:33:28,370 --> 00:33:30,700
Allright. Notify Rochester and Detroit.

412
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:32,200
Run everything back through me.

413
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,210
- Kelsey, you wanna give us a sec?
- Yeah.

414
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:46,850
If you need anything ...

415
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,980
You got to take a couple of days off,
to be with the family.

416
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,780
That's why I spend 18 years on the force
to let somebody else find my own kid?

417
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:00,060
This gets messy and I'm not
going to have any choice.

418
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:01,360
Do you understand?

419
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,700
Sure.

420
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:14,780
Excuse me, sir.
You got a visitor.

421
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:20,980
Where is she?

422
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,980
Where did you get this one Tad?

423
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,890
Abby was at the diner last night.

424
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,190
You lied to my wife about seeing her?

425
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,340
We had a fight.
I didn't know what else to do.

426
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,600
Allright she snuck out,
I just didn't want her to get in trouble.

427
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:41,810
- Tell me what happened.
- I didn't do anything.

428
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:44,040
Allright look, we got into an argument
then she run out.

429
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,610
- She left her jacket and phone, that's it.
- Where did she go?

430
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,650
On to the street.
I should have followed her outside.

431
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,680
- You didn't go after her?
- No!

432
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,510
- Was she alone? Or she was with someone?
- No.

433
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,250
Who was she with?

434
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,390
Who was she with?

435
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,120
- She was talking to somebody outside.
- Who was she talking to?

436
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,490
She was talking to somebody
outside in a car.

437
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:03,730
You let my daughter get into a car
in the middle of the night?

438
00:35:03,930 --> 00:35:06,220
- It happened too fast, I couldn't see.
- What did the car look like Tad?

439
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,000
- Come on!
- It was a dark sedan!

440
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,370
I'm telling you the truth,
I swear to God.

441
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,180
I didn't ask her to sneak out.

442
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,440
And when Mrs. Fletcher kept calling,
I panicked.

443
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,880
Okay, I didn't know what to do.

444
00:35:23,950 --> 00:35:25,040
That's why I'm here now.

445
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:34,650
He was there.

446
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,800
This guy.

447
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:39,960
He was at the diner last night.

448
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:58,880
So ...

449
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:01,050
Sleeping Beauty awakes.

450
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,680
Jesus.

451
00:36:06,490 --> 00:36:07,760
You're the replacement?

452
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,030
What, you're like 12?

453
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,560
I'm 17.

454
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,900
Oh my God, you're a baby.

455
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,890
He's going to love you long time.

456
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:19,570
What is this?
Where are we?

457
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,240
How long have you been down here?

458
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,040
34 and a half cycles.

459
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,840
I'm sorry.

460
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:29,580
There's plenty of time to be sorry.

461
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,250
Is it really Thanksgiving?

462
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,820
Who is that?
Who the fuck was that?

463
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,280
Oh that? It's just Lauren.

464
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,830
- This is bordering on harassment.
- We haven't even started yet.

465
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,530
I'm sorry, where's the harassment?

466
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,700
She's part of an ongoing investigation.
She was under your care for 3 months.

467
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,730
- This is standard procedure.
- This is bullshit.

468
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,770
How many times do I have to explain this?

469
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:50,740
One more time, come on.

470
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:55,110
I'm a postnatal nurse. Lauren was in physio,
she was never under my care.

471
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,610
I drop in and say hello to her every few days.

472
00:36:59,110 --> 00:37:01,670
Hookers don't tend to get a lot of visitors,
that's what nurses do.

473
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:06,040
The night she went missing, I was in surgery
with a dozen witnesses but you know that

474
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,390
Because you questioned them all,
already.

475
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:15,020
This whole thing is .... is really sad.

476
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,350
But you know what I know.

477
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,690
- So, if that's all ...
- Sit the fuck down!

478
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,400
Where were you last night?

479
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:26,530
I was here, I pulled a double.

480
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,740
How come a witness put you in
a diner downtown?

481
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,440
Where another girl was abducted.

482
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,140
That's not possible.
I don't know anything about some other girl.

483
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:36,340
No, no. Not some other girl.
This girl. Look at it.

484
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:38,720
Do you recognize her?

485
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,720
Look, I told you I don't know what
the fuck you talking about.

486
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,690
- Bullshit.
- Mike!

487
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,490
I know you were there,
You fat fuck.

488
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:47,080
Look!

489
00:37:51,030 --> 00:37:52,260
Check it out with his boss.

490
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,560
Check it out with his boss.

491
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:06,550
I'm at the end of a very long
shift detective so ...

492
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,680
Both of you were at that diner last night.

493
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,380
I know about Lauren Daniels and the
seven other girls, allright?

494
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,280
I don't know what you talking about.
What seven other girls?

495
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,250
I think you know about my Goddamn daughter, do you?

496
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
I think you know where my girl is!

497
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,450
I swear to God!

498
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,750
I swear to God, I don't know anything
about your daughter!

499
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:25,920
That's it, we're done.

500
00:38:33,770 --> 00:38:34,740
Maybe Tad made a mistake!

501
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:36,570
Scrubs, he said scrubs.

502
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:40,770
How many 300 pound black nurses
you think we have in this fucking town?

503
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,680
You saw the roster which means there's
still nothing to connect Abby to the case.

504
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,680
That's a good thing,
he only targets hookers.

505
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,720
- Read the description.
- Mike.

506
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,620
Kelsey, read it.

507
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:52,680
What does it say?

508
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,490
"17 year old, single white female"

509
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,920
"Last seen on the corner of Fillmore and Ferry."

510
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:05,770
"Short black skirt, low-cut top.
Heavy makeup."

511
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,210
What does that sound like to you?

512
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:13,210
It didn't take long.

513
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,680
Hey, chief.

514
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,920
God. Hi, Daddy.

515
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,420
Please take me down.
It really hurts me.

516
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,080
Pill patrol.

517
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,700
How much longer she got now daddy?

518
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,570
- Eight weeks, three days.
- She's doing good, huh?

519
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:22,870
Better than you.

520
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:25,690
I'm trying daddy, you know I'm committed.

521
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,580
It's only a matter of time.

522
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,220
That's how you keep saying.

523
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,690
Maybe you're broke.

524
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:43,570
It's the well for you next time.

525
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,410
How's our new addition?

526
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,070
You settling in allright?

527
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,770
What does it matter?

528
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,780
I'm not going to be here for long.

529
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,980
My dad's a cop.

530
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:02,660
Up there, maybe.
Not down here.

531
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,350
Are you sure?

532
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:07,830
Because he knows all about you,
you sick fuck.

533
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,290
I don't think so.

534
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,330
I think I'm going to be just fine.

535
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,540
I think we're all going to be just fine.

536
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,890
A couple of weeks off
might be a good thing.

537
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,590
Daddy, what's wrong?

538
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,020
Go inside.

539
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,090
- But, Daddy ...
- I won't tell you again. Go inside.

540
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,180
There are some rules that
we have in this family.

541
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:43,820
You'll get to know them.
They are relatively simple.

542
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,680
But for now, It really is just a matter
of good old fashioned give and take.

543
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:53,050
You eat what I give you.
You don't touch anything.

544
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,330
Unless I tell you to.

545
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,260
And everybody does their part.

546
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:05,790
Ain't that right, Brittany?

547
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,730
I got a good feeling about this one daddy.

548
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,210
What do you think?

549
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:17,380
Hey.

550
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,710
I'm talking to you.

551
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,610
What do you think?

552
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,720
Do you think we're going
to get lucky this time?

553
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,690
- Wait... what are you doing?
- Lauren, honey ...

554
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:34,790
Will you do the honors?

555
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:48,280
- Babies are made out of love.
- That's right.

556
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:51,650
Babies are made out of love.

557
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,720
Mommy, if Abby doesn't come back,
does that mean I get her presents?

558
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:47,890
Helps to get things flowing
in the right direction.

559
00:46:58,250 --> 00:46:59,340
Hey.

560
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:03,810
You dind't think I forgot, did you?

561
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:15,130
Happy anniversary, Mommy.

562
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:16,760
Thank you, Daddy.

563
00:47:36,450 --> 00:47:37,780
You looking for something bigger?

564
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:42,810
Actually I'm waiting on a warrant
for Darryl's appartmen.

565
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,820
We're not very popular with the D.A right now.

566
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,620
Yeah.

567
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,750
I thought I'd get some work done from home.

568
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,700
Shelley will probably like that.

569
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,730
I'll call you later.

570
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,530
Jesus fucking Christ.
You looking to get shot?

571
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:07,640
I'm backing you up in case some
nosy neighbor calls in a B and E ...

572
00:49:07,810 --> 00:49:09,830
... and find yourself explaining this
to some uniform cop.

573
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,740
You seen this?

574
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,610
Take a look.

575
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,570
That fat piece of shit lives right across
the street from where Abby was taken.

576
00:49:21,690 --> 00:49:24,490
Lauren, What did he inject me with?

577
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:25,780
Don't worry.

578
00:49:27,490 --> 00:49:28,490
It's good for you.

579
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,960
Gets you nice and ready.

580
00:49:31,570 --> 00:49:32,900
He gives it to all the girls.

581
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,690
How many others have there been?

582
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:37,900
Well there was the first.

583
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,040
Daddy talks about her all the time.

584
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,170
Then me, Lisa, Brittany ...

585
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:47,040
Sarah, Amanda ...

586
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,380
Abby.

587
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:51,770
What happened to them?

588
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,020
They just weren't good mommies.

589
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,290
That's why she's so scared?

590
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,490
Daddy saved her from some crackhouse ...

591
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:04,630
... gave her all this, and she can't
give him anything In return?

592
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,300
This is number two for me.

593
00:50:06,930 --> 00:50:09,330
And Brittany has been given
a lot of chances, but ...

594
00:50:09,570 --> 00:50:11,500
... sound like daddy has lost
patience with her.

595
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:13,560
How long have you been here?

596
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:16,400
Just had our 3 year anniversary.

597
00:50:17,810 --> 00:50:19,070
How did you guys meet?

598
00:50:19,310 --> 00:50:20,780
It was like fate, Abby.

599
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:24,810
This John hit me in his car
and smashed up my legs pretty good.

600
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:28,780
I went up In this hospital,
where I met this nurse, Darryl.

601
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,620
I think he had a crush on me because
he was always dropping In to say hello.

602
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:37,820
This one day, just before Christmas ...

603
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,460
... one of the doctors comes in,
looking all serious ...

604
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,000
And tells me ... I'm pregnant.

605
00:50:46,170 --> 00:50:47,830
I went to sleep that night ...

606
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,840
and when I woke up ...

607
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:52,170
I was here.

608
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,670
See, daddy saved me.

609
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,650
From what?

610
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,850
From breaking a family silly.

611
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:06,690
Daddy says there are whores who
are disgusting and break up families

612
00:51:06,890 --> 00:51:10,430
So he takes us off the streets so we can
build a family rather than destroy them.

613
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,470
Lauren.

614
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:18,400
What happened to the babies?

615
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,710
We are not meant to talk about it.

616
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,840
I'm sure he'll show you
if you're good.

617
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,270
It won't be too long now.
I'm sure you'll have one too.

618
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,510
Turn off the light.

619
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:38,810
Get out of here, leave me alone.

620
00:51:39,990 --> 00:51:42,480
"Pass the salt"?
I can't remember what it was.

621
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,900
I might never see Abby again and the
last thing I said was "turn off the fucking light"?

622
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:49,600
Are you kidding me?

623
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:53,830
You need to go home, get some sleep.
You've been up for two days straight.

624
00:51:54,810 --> 00:51:56,140
I can't sleep, Kelsey.

625
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:58,040
What would you do?

626
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:00,540
What we've seen.

627
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,210
That's Abby now.

628
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:07,280
You're wrong Mike.

629
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,420
She's not like the girls
we've been looking for.

630
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,680
She's not.

631
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:18,590
She's not like the girl that went missing
from my home town when I was young.

632
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,790
Because ...

633
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:27,600
Went out one day and never came back,
like she vanished into thin air.

634
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:30,140
Do you know why?

635
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:33,580
Because that girl didn't have anyone
to put up posters.

636
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,710
Or knock on doors or stay out all night
trolling the streets.

637
00:52:40,220 --> 00:52:43,490
Once that girl went missing it was like
she never existed in the first place

638
00:52:43,590 --> 00:52:45,290
and that is not Abby.

639
00:52:47,890 --> 00:52:49,050
She's got you.

640
00:52:51,560 --> 00:52:52,930
And Shelley and me.

641
00:52:53,730 --> 00:52:54,790
She's got family.

642
00:52:57,370 --> 00:52:59,030
So wherever she is, she's not alone.

643
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,570
I promise you that.

644
00:53:05,050 --> 00:53:06,340
Get some sleep.

645
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,780
I'll call you in the morning.

646
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:44,610
Thank you for calling Stenlakes of Buffalo.
Please leave a message.

647
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:47,510
It's detective Mike Fletcher,
Buffalo P.D.

648
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,610
Need to ask you some questions
about a Darryl Kennedy.

649
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:40,930
He said he wants a ...

650
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:45,340
Wii from Santa.

651
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,970
You know what this is?

652
00:54:47,710 --> 00:54:49,050
It's already under the tree.

653
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:51,780
Good.

654
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:58,120
It's true what they say
about the first 48 hours, right?

655
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:11,940
But Shelley, Kelsey's out there.
Everybody's doing everything they can.

656
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:15,540
But they're not her father.

657
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:23,140
I'm going to bring her home, I promise.

658
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,050
Come on buddy, you can't park here.

659
00:56:35,290 --> 00:56:36,280
Come on, let's go.

660
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:42,690
Mike Fletcher.

661
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,790
Why don't you grab a coffee?
I'll let her know you're here.

662
00:56:56,740 --> 00:56:57,770
Hey.

663
00:56:58,440 --> 00:56:59,740
Have some strong coffee?

664
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,550
Yeah, sure.

665
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:15,130
You know a fella who works here,
named Darryl Kennedy?

666
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,860
You mean in the kitchen?

667
00:57:19,030 --> 00:57:21,490
No, no. I don't know. A big guy?

668
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:23,560
Assistant nurse.

669
00:57:26,570 --> 00:57:30,200
You're talking about Big D.
Yeah, I mean, I know Big D.

670
00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:34,650
A guys his size is going to spend a little time with
his nose in the troph, you know what I mean?

671
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:36,840
You know him well?

672
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:41,520
No. I know that he likes my southern fried chicken.

673
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:45,450
That's about it.
Hell, he likes pretty much anything I put in front of him.

674
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:54,300
I'm not bleeding, Am I?
My boss is going to kill me, I'm sorry.

675
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:58,500
I banged the shit out of myself,
this morning.

676
00:57:58,570 --> 00:58:00,770
Coming out from under the hood of my car.

677
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:05,540
Thank God I'm a better chef than I am a mechanic,
you know what I mean?

678
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,580
I apologize for my behavior yesterday.

679
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:19,950
I just lost control.
I was way out of line.

680
00:58:20,890 --> 00:58:23,050
I just need to ask you
a few questions about Darryl.

681
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,290
I can't help you with Darryl, I'm afraid.

682
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,390
After what happened, I sent him home.

683
00:58:28,940 --> 00:58:31,700
And he didn't show up for work this morning.
No phone calls, nothing.

684
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:33,930
That's not like him.

685
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,440
I'll make sure to tell him
you dropped by.

686
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,740
No, please, just ...
What would he want ...

687
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,440
... with any of these?

688
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:48,980
Did you write this?

689
00:58:49,890 --> 00:58:51,580
Me? No.

690
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,580
Well I can guarantee you
it wasn't written by Darryl

691
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,980
Or anybody else on my stuff
for that matter.

692
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,260
How can you do that?

693
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:00,500
Accurate notation is
paramount to patient care.

694
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:04,460
Spelling is all wrong
and It's medically inaccurate.

695
00:59:07,470 --> 00:59:08,500
What's all this stuff for?

696
00:59:08,810 --> 00:59:11,380
Nutritional supplements,
for malnourishment.

697
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:13,140
Heparin, is an anticoagulant.

698
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,070
It's for thrombosis,
for patients with immobility.

699
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:18,780
F.S.H. Is a fertility drug.

700
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:21,920
- It's injectable.
- I don't understand.

701
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:25,090
All this shit's been missing from the hospital
for the best part of three years, right?

702
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:27,020
The exact same time frame as our case.

703
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:32,160
Most of this stuff, prolongs life.

704
00:59:34,570 --> 00:59:36,330
Maybe that's why we never found a body

705
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,500
Do you think Darryl's holding these girls?

706
00:59:41,540 --> 00:59:42,800
Darryl didn't write this shit.

707
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:45,140
This is somebody else's handwritting.

708
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:47,340
I think there's somebody else.

709
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:49,010
Maybe he's with somebody else.

710
00:59:51,420 --> 00:59:52,480
What do you think?

711
00:59:52,850 --> 00:59:54,250
You want to know what I think?

712
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:57,290
I think you need to go home.

713
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,250
I think you need to stay your family.

714
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,230
I think you need to get your fucking
head straight, that's what I think.

715
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:06,220
- Oh , Come on!
- Come on what? You had this for 12 hours Mike.

716
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:08,930
You had this last night
and you sat on it?

717
01:00:09,170 --> 01:00:11,360
You didn't think to tell me about it?

718
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,800
How the fuck does that
helping me find Abby?

719
01:00:15,810 --> 01:00:16,930
That's not us Mike.

720
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:18,870
That's not who we are.

721
01:00:28,650 --> 01:00:30,210
Look, Mike.

722
01:00:31,230 --> 01:00:34,150
I have heard you ... and I'm on it.

723
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:37,090
Get some sleep.

724
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:40,520
Trust me you'll find Abby.

725
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:50,200
Hello?

726
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:53,670
Listen, It's only a matter of time.
We just got to be smart, right?

727
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:55,750
See, my dad is looking for us.

728
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,650
- He's looking for all of us right now.
- No one is looking for us silly.

729
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,450
He is. I swear to God,
This is his case.

730
01:01:03,060 --> 01:01:05,490
I've seen your pictures on his wall.

731
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:08,320
I know.
He never stopped looking for you.

732
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,720
Okay? I swear to God.

733
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:14,730
- And my family will not give up ...
- Shut up! This is your family now.

734
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:17,160
No, no.

735
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:19,330
Please, this is ...

736
01:01:19,770 --> 01:01:21,360
This is not a family.

737
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:23,900
You can't say that.

738
01:01:24,780 --> 01:01:25,770
Too late.

739
01:01:26,450 --> 01:01:27,430
Wait.

740
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,210
We are in this together ...

741
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:31,570
right?

742
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,280
Right?

743
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:34,980
Wrong.

744
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,380
Wait!

745
01:01:49,570 --> 01:01:52,560
She was telling secrets daddy.
Talking about leaving us.

746
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:54,710
Said her dad is going to look
for us and find us.

747
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,500
But we don't want him to,
because we belong here with you.

748
01:01:58,480 --> 01:01:59,600
Is that right?

749
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:02,570
It's true daddy.

750
01:02:05,420 --> 01:02:06,610
Thank you ladies.

751
01:02:14,860 --> 01:02:16,950
Now you're going to see how
things happen around here.

752
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:20,760
Again.

753
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,930
- God!
- You'll learn, honey.

754
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:26,000
You will learn that this ...

755
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:32,310
This is a sign of trust ...

756
01:02:32,310 --> 01:02:35,040
Of loyalty, of commitment.

757
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:38,140
Because without commitment,
we're nowhere.

758
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,850
You are sick!

759
01:02:44,060 --> 01:02:46,150
I guess we're going to have to explain it again.

760
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:56,170
So I hear from one of my girls,
same night Abby went missing

761
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:00,770
Some guy tries to drag her into his car.

762
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:02,600
A dark sedan.

763
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:04,110
She cracks a bottle over his head, you know?

764
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:05,600
Hits him pretty good.

765
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:06,940
And gets the fuck out of there.

766
01:03:07,810 --> 01:03:09,010
I don't even know her.

767
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,040
She works out of this apartment here.

768
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:14,910
Girls get beat up every night of the weekend here
so it could easily be nothing.

769
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,380
I just thought even though is nothing,
maybe it's something.

770
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,090
Your loss, buddy.

771
01:03:55,130 --> 01:03:56,320
I'm looking for Emma.

772
01:03:59,400 --> 01:04:00,370
250.

773
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,160
Three doors, down on the left.

774
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,090
Make yourself at home.

775
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:37,300
Is this your first time?

776
01:04:39,770 --> 01:04:40,830
Yeah.

777
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:42,630
Yeah, you'll be fine.

778
01:04:53,950 --> 01:04:55,050
Must hurt.

779
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,290
Yeah, you should have seen the other guy.

780
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:01,220
Yeah?

781
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,330
- You got in a fight? Someone hit you?
- Oh, yeah.

782
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,700
It was really scary.

783
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,730
I wish you would have been there
because you would have ...

784
01:05:13,210 --> 01:05:14,830
You would have hurt him for me, right?

785
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:17,700
I would have fucking killed him.

786
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:24,170
Who's this guy?
What did he look like, the guy who hit you?

787
01:05:25,650 --> 01:05:27,380
I don't know.
He came at me from behind.

788
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:31,080
So I couldn't ... see his face.
He just kept telling me to shut up.

789
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,210
What did he sound like?

790
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:35,950
- I mean, what his voice sound ...
- I don't know.

791
01:05:36,260 --> 01:05:39,130
Like he wasn't from around here.

792
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,660
He had an accent maybe?

793
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:43,790
- What kind of accent did he have?
- What is this, 20 questions?

794
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,790
He sounded like a redneck, Okay?

795
01:05:47,010 --> 01:05:49,800
And he smelled like a fucking
hotdog stand.

796
01:05:49,810 --> 01:05:50,800
Onions and shit.

797
01:05:51,410 --> 01:05:52,670
Anything else you want to know?

798
01:05:53,410 --> 01:05:54,400
I don't get it.

799
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:56,140
You want to fuck him or me?

800
01:06:00,150 --> 01:06:02,210
Just slow down for a minute.
I just want to get to know you.

801
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:04,850
- I just want to take it easy.
- You want to take it easy?

802
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,160
You know what, time is money mister.

803
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:08,820
Don't do that!

804
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,680
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

805
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:23,970
Nice one, asshole.

806
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:25,970
I just got he down.

807
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:31,680
Get the fuck out of here before Jerome
throws your ass down the stairs.

808
01:06:35,350 --> 01:06:36,790
You've got to commit to him.

809
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:42,760
That's why we're here.
The other girls aren't.

810
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,820
We only did what we had to.

811
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:47,530
And good girls get rewards.

812
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:51,860
Like once a week, he invites one
of us upstairs for date night.

813
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,700
With good food and a nice soft bed.

814
01:06:57,210 --> 01:06:59,440
You can sometimes see out the window
and everything.

815
01:06:59,710 --> 01:07:01,040
Don't waste your breath.

816
01:07:02,080 --> 01:07:04,210
At this rate, she won't even last
'till the end of the week.

817
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,640
Ain't that right, princess?

818
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:21,990
Why, why, why?

819
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:24,860
- Sure starting to come down now.
- What?

820
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:28,410
Oh, yeah.

821
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:31,970
Don't look like you go anywhere in a hurry.

822
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:48,620
I'll forgive you.

823
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:54,130
You're eating with me tonight.

824
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,560
I'm sorry, Daddy.

825
01:08:00,970 --> 01:08:02,370
I didn't mean to mess up.

826
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,740
I promise I'm not going to do it anymore.

827
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,710
I'm sorry too.

828
01:08:14,650 --> 01:08:16,880
I don't like having to do things like that, It's ...

829
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,650
That's not me.

830
01:08:21,590 --> 01:08:23,220
You going to eat something finally?

831
01:08:37,740 --> 01:08:40,040
Go on. I trust you.

832
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:54,560
I just spoke with TSA at Buffalo Niagara.

833
01:08:54,860 --> 01:08:57,690
Delta's got a Darryl Kennedy
booked to fly out on the 9:30

834
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,260
But the airpost just cancelled
all flights because of the storm.

835
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:03,270
Call all the units to the terminal
in case the asshole shows up.

836
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:05,300
And put a uniform outside his aparment.

837
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:08,470
- You find him, I am your first call.
- Got it.

838
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:24,410
Where are you?

839
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,560
While I'm eating fried chicken
and drinking wine ...

840
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,000
I'll probably tell daddy that
you aren't really sorry after all.

841
01:09:39,570 --> 01:09:41,540
That you told me you hated him and ...

842
01:09:41,740 --> 01:09:43,370
Never wanted to be part of this family.

843
01:09:43,740 --> 01:09:44,940
Hey, you can't touch his things.

844
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:49,770
- You're so fucked.
- Please don't do that. He'll kill you.

845
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:51,940
Nice knowing you.

846
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:57,450
What the hell is going on?

847
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,920
- Brittany! You of all people.
- Daddy, no ...

848
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,720
No daddy, you don't understand!
It's not what you think.

849
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,660
- Sure as shit looks like it.
- Please don't do that.

850
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:12,460
- I'll be better, I promise, Daddy.
- You left me no choice girl.

851
01:10:12,570 --> 01:10:13,970
Please don't make me go in there daddy.

852
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:15,040
- Please!
- Go on!

853
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:17,370
- It's so cold.
- Get in the goddamned well.

854
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:19,680
You heard that shit, move your hands.

855
01:10:20,280 --> 01:10:21,750
Oh my God, stop, please!

856
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:24,370
Please let her go.
You can't do that.

857
01:10:27,250 --> 01:10:29,780
Please stop, she's striving.
She's going to die.

858
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:33,520
Please, she's pregnant!

859
01:10:33,990 --> 01:10:36,120
That's why she hit the buzzer,
she wanted to tell you

860
01:10:36,260 --> 01:10:38,520
And she put on the music
and she was happy, I promise.

861
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:40,900
- How did she know?
- We just know these things!

862
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:43,370
Please, daddy, please,
she's going to die!

863
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:46,700
Lauren. No secrets.

864
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,710
It's true daddy.

865
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,480
Hurry, is she breathing?

866
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:01,780
Is she okay?

867
01:11:01,780 --> 01:11:04,780
Yes, she's going to be okay.
Up you go girl.

868
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:07,560
She just swallowed a bunch of water.
Didn't you darling?

869
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,690
She's going to sleep it off.
She'll be right as rain.

870
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:12,890
You just get some sleep now momma.

871
01:11:14,230 --> 01:11:15,360
That's it, good girl.

872
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:21,700
I'll be goddamned.

873
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:24,170
Looks like she came through after all.

874
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:26,580
I can hardly believe it.

875
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:28,680
Guess that means you're up honey.

876
01:11:30,180 --> 01:11:31,340
I'll pick you up at 8.

877
01:11:32,890 --> 01:11:33,910
That's for when she wakes up.

878
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:37,250
You never can be too sure about this things.

879
01:11:44,200 --> 01:11:45,360
What am I missing Kelsey?

880
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:48,360
It's staring me right in the face.
What am I not seeing?

881
01:11:58,280 --> 01:11:59,240
What about her?

882
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:01,840
Did she get a good look at him?
Maybe she can make him on a lineup?

883
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:02,740
The Kid? No, no, no.

884
01:12:03,050 --> 01:12:05,080
She was close enough to
hit him in the head with a bottle

885
01:12:05,180 --> 01:12:07,580
but she couldn't make his face.
I guess that's something, huh?

886
01:12:08,550 --> 01:12:10,820
Yeah, good for her. I hope it hurt.

887
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,290
Do you think It's our guy?

888
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:17,860
He's got to be.

889
01:12:18,700 --> 01:12:21,600
The same night, 30 minutes from
where Abby was taken, 4 blocks away.

890
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:22,860
It's got to be him, right?

891
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:26,030
Detective Walker.

892
01:12:28,140 --> 01:12:29,800
Sorry sergeant, slow down, I can't ...

893
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:33,070
You're breaking up.
Let me call you back.

894
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:35,810
What? What, what?

895
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:39,040
Okay, go.

896
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:40,580
Hotel Bourbon.

897
01:12:40,890 --> 01:12:43,450
Suite 233.
And they definitely confirmed that it's him?

898
01:12:43,860 --> 01:12:45,690
- What?
- We'll be there in 20.

899
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:48,330
- What goddamnit, what?
- They just called a bunch of airport hotels.

900
01:12:48,460 --> 01:12:51,860
They found us a 300 pound black guy
who just checked in, paying all cash.

901
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:53,700
We got him.

902
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:00,000
You want to slow down a little?
He's not going anywhere.

903
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,380
Fuck!

904
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:44,080
I'll get the front.

905
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:59,800
Hello! Hello!
The hell is everyone?

906
01:14:10,610 --> 01:14:13,200
Darryl open up, It's detective Walker!
We have a warrant.

907
01:14:18,580 --> 01:14:19,680
We're coming In.

908
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:32,030
- Get up asshole, get up!
- Darryl?

909
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:33,700
Christ.

910
01:14:34,730 --> 01:14:36,560
- No pulse.
- Fuck!

911
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:38,800
It demerol.

912
01:14:41,940 --> 01:14:43,640
- Darryl?
- We need an ambulance.

913
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:45,210
Bourbon hotel, second floor.

914
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,200
Don't you fucking die Darryl.

915
01:14:55,890 --> 01:14:57,320
Mike, get on the phone.

916
01:15:00,690 --> 01:15:01,720
Mike?

917
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:34,120
I'm so sorry I'm late, honey.

918
01:15:41,630 --> 01:15:42,860
I'll be damned.

919
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,800
You sure do scrub up nice.
You might be the prettiest one yet.

920
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:54,280
She's sleepig pretty
soundly now daddy but ...

921
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:56,180
she came to a while ago.

922
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,860
Let's see if we can get you one too.

923
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,290
Allright.

924
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:38,990
You ready?

925
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:52,760
It's like we're in a date.

926
01:16:53,770 --> 01:16:55,710
I want to make our first time real special.

927
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:58,930
I'm not sure if I'm all that special.

928
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:00,740
I hope you like Cajun chicken.

929
01:17:01,910 --> 01:17:05,180
- It's one of my specialties.
- I love anything southern.

930
01:17:09,290 --> 01:17:10,910
Let's have a look, shall we?

931
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,560
You know, a lot of folks will tell you
there's only one way to season a bird

932
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,860
but I say the hell with that.
I throw a lot of spices at it.

933
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:27,930
Cooking for me, it's
like life, you know?

934
01:17:28,840 --> 01:17:31,240
Just got to do what feels natural.

935
01:17:31,740 --> 01:17:32,840
you know what I mean?

936
01:17:39,480 --> 01:17:40,850
Are you going to get
drunk tonight daddy?

937
01:17:41,290 --> 01:17:42,280
Damn.

938
01:17:42,650 --> 01:17:44,680
We got a wild one on our hands, don't we?

939
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:51,690
You want to see this.

940
01:17:55,030 --> 01:17:56,760
Forensics is here,
they're going to move everything.

941
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:03,300
Well wherever he's going, he's not going
to leave without some trophies.

942
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,100
It's all here, body parts.

943
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:10,210
Yeah, there's a scrapbook
with credit cards and photos.

944
01:18:12,280 --> 01:18:13,440
He's not doing so good.

945
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:19,690
- Mike Fletcher.
- Hi Detective Fletcher

946
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,850
This is Chelsea from Stenlakes
returning your call.

947
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:23,550
- Sorry?
- Stenlakes of Buffalo.

948
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:25,700
You left a message regarding
a Darryl Kennedy?

949
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:26,730
- Oh, yeah.
- Right.

950
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:30,520
So we checked our books and unfortunately
we got no record of a Darryl Kennedy.

951
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:33,830
- Neither as a client or employee.
- I understand.

952
01:18:34,170 --> 01:18:36,160
Sorry It's taken us a little
while to get back to you ...

953
01:18:36,240 --> 01:18:38,770
as you can imagine we get
pretty slammed over Thanksgiving.

954
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:42,480
- Excuse me?
- All catering companies do.

955
01:18:42,710 --> 01:18:44,180
It's our busiest time of the year.

956
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:47,110
- You are a catering company?
- Yeah, commercial catering.

957
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:50,410
- Offices, industrials ...
- Wait a second, you do hospitals?

958
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,220
Sure, we've got our guys over it.

959
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:55,430
Sheehan Memorial
Mercy Hospital, Buffalo Regional.

960
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:58,020
I got you little motherfucker, I got you.

961
01:19:07,010 --> 01:19:08,770
I'm sorry sir,
I'm going to have to call you right back.

962
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,600
- What's going on, Mike?
- I saw him.

963
01:19:11,880 --> 01:19:13,100
I spoke with him goddamnit.

964
01:19:13,310 --> 01:19:15,750
I saw the cut on his head
when she hit him with the bottle.

965
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:17,400
He's southern, just like she said.

966
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:19,680
She even said that he smelled food.

967
01:19:20,820 --> 01:19:22,510
These drugs weren't for Darryl.

968
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,050
You are not making any sense.
What the hell are you talking about?

969
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,050
Looking for him.

970
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:28,850
Looking for him.

971
01:19:29,730 --> 01:19:31,630
Carl Anthony Gemeaux.

972
01:19:33,630 --> 01:19:34,890
I got this motherfucker.

973
01:19:41,470 --> 01:19:42,910
What am I supposed
to tell the chief Mike?

974
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,370
Anything you want.

975
01:20:00,490 --> 01:20:01,480
May I?

976
01:20:02,930 --> 01:20:03,920
Sure darling.

977
01:20:05,860 --> 01:20:06,920
To Family.

978
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,400
Hold that thought.

979
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:26,880
Hello?

980
01:21:00,520 --> 01:21:02,210
Chief, we're on our way to his house now.

981
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,720
Carl Anthony Gemeaux.

982
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:06,020
We're not sure what his connection is.

983
01:21:06,220 --> 01:21:08,720
Maybe he's using Darryl to get
hospital meds, I don't know.

984
01:21:10,930 --> 01:21:12,230
Yes he's with me.

985
01:21:26,980 --> 01:21:28,740
You ungrateful little bitch.

986
01:21:37,890 --> 01:21:38,910
Motherfucker!

987
01:22:16,900 --> 01:22:17,920
Mike!

988
01:23:27,730 --> 01:23:29,460
It's too early.

989
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:32,460
I'm not ready.

990
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:52,740
It's okay.

991
01:24:56,550 --> 01:24:57,820
You're going to be fine, allright?

992
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:58,990
You're going to be fine.

993
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,860
- You just have to push, Okay?
- I can't.

994
01:25:01,860 --> 01:25:04,620
I got no muscle control
down there since the accident.

995
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:07,290
You have to cut it out.

996
01:25:09,530 --> 01:25:10,730
Just like the last one.

997
01:26:30,720 --> 01:26:32,380
Hello?
Hello, anybody there?

998
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:35,080
Hello, is anybody down there?
Who's down there? Hello?

999
01:26:36,090 --> 01:26:37,380
Hello?

1000
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:39,650
Hello?

1001
01:26:40,760 --> 01:26:41,750
Dad?

1002
01:26:42,290 --> 01:26:43,560
Daddy is that you?

1003
01:26:43,860 --> 01:26:45,620
Abby? Abby.

1004
01:26:45,860 --> 01:26:48,660
Oh God, daddy,
I knew you would come.

1005
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:50,930
Daddy, oh my God.

1006
01:26:53,100 --> 01:26:55,560
Dad listen,
the key is around his neck, Okay?

1007
01:26:56,810 --> 01:26:59,500
Daddy, did you hear me?
The key is around his neck.

1008
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:02,810
Please you have to hurry,
there's two other girls down here ...

1009
01:27:02,810 --> 01:27:05,270
and they really need a hospital,
please daddy hurry.

1010
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:07,880
No, no, no, Abby,
It's okay, I'm here.

1011
01:27:08,850 --> 01:27:09,980
I'm going to come get you out.

1012
01:27:10,720 --> 01:27:11,850
Just wait for a minute.

1013
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,720
I'm going to get the key
and I'm going to come right back.

1014
01:27:13,890 --> 01:27:14,760
Kelsey is going to stay with you.

1015
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,690
Anybody else goes down
the stairs with me, kill him.

1016
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:50,990
Oh my God, I can't do this!

1017
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:38,700
Mike?

1018
01:29:47,850 --> 01:29:48,870
Are you okay?

1019
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:04,290
Hey, hey.

1020
01:30:06,160 --> 01:30:07,150
Look at me.

1021
01:30:16,210 --> 01:30:17,370
You are not going to make it.

1022
01:30:23,010 --> 01:30:23,980
Mike.

1023
01:30:30,860 --> 01:30:31,820
Jesus Kelsey.

1024
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,810
We would have
taken good care of Abby.

1025
01:30:54,110 --> 01:30:55,670
We would have treated her
like one of our own.

1026
01:30:56,450 --> 01:30:59,010
But instead you went and you did this
and you left me no choice.

1027
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:00,810
What am I missing Kelsey?

1028
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:03,250
It's staring me right in the face.
What am I not seeing?

1029
01:31:03,720 --> 01:31:05,310
It's Mike's daughter for God's sake.

1030
01:31:05,490 --> 01:31:07,250
I just thought she was another girl.

1031
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:08,950
Well she's not just
any other girl, allright?

1032
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,760
Should we just go ahead as usual?

1033
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:12,850
Just do what you have to do.

1034
01:31:13,060 --> 01:31:15,760
We're on our way to his house now,
Carl Anthony Gemeaux.

1035
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:18,700
It's not sad enough she's a 30 year old woman
who can't have kids

1036
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:20,630
You want to deprive her social life too?

1037
01:31:20,740 --> 01:31:22,300
Can I get your list of plates from last night?

1038
01:31:22,370 --> 01:31:24,360
I want you to be happy.
Who is this fucking guy?

1039
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,840
He has access to DMV records,
what else does he have?

1040
01:31:26,840 --> 01:31:29,400
I was the dumbass who fought
to be on this case, remember?

1041
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,610
- Maybe he's with someone else.
- You're breaking up, let me call you back.

1042
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:33,550
You find him, I am your first call.

1043
01:31:33,620 --> 01:31:36,380
She's not like the girl that went missing
from my hometown when I was young.

1044
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:39,660
Went out one day and never came back.

1045
01:31:39,860 --> 01:31:41,850
Like she vanished into thin air.

1046
01:31:43,590 --> 01:31:44,620
Come here, baby.

1047
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:50,530
There she is.

1048
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,060
There she is.

1049
01:31:54,940 --> 01:31:55,960
The first.

1050
01:32:10,150 --> 01:32:11,250
Need a lift?

1051
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:13,320
Where are you headed?

1052
01:32:14,090 --> 01:32:15,150
Anywhere.

1053
01:32:16,690 --> 01:32:17,720
Come on.

1054
01:32:36,980 --> 01:32:39,250
I just wish I could
have given you one myself.

1055
01:32:39,980 --> 01:32:41,080
Even just one.

1056
01:32:42,690 --> 01:32:43,710
Me too.

1057
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:47,610
You did your part, huh?

1058
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,530
You made us feel safe.

1059
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,920
You made us feel protected.

1060
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,790
That's what families do.

1061
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,360
You be strong darling.

1062
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:03,810
You are going to be a great,
great mommy.

1063
01:33:08,810 --> 01:33:09,800
Daddy.

1064
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,790
You should be real proud, Mike.

1065
01:33:31,800 --> 01:33:33,530
You did everything
you could to save Abby.

1066
01:33:36,810 --> 01:33:38,710
But I have kids of my own to think of now.

1067
01:34:03,770 --> 01:34:05,000
I found it in Abby's room.

1068
01:34:07,340 --> 01:34:08,810
She's starting a family too.

1069
01:34:13,780 --> 01:34:15,210
You can't hurt her anymore, can you?

1070
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,270
Can you?

1071
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:32,720
Kelsey.

1072
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:35,790
You're just like the other girls.

1073
01:34:39,640 --> 01:34:40,760
Kelsey, you're a victim.

1074
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,940
He doesn't love you anymore.

1075
01:34:48,050 --> 01:34:50,040
I was lost before daddy found me.

1076
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:51,410
I'm not a victim.

1077
01:34:53,780 --> 01:34:54,910
I am a mother.

1078
01:34:56,320 --> 01:34:57,250
Kelsey.

1079
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,570
Kelsey?

1080
01:35:19,210 --> 01:35:20,870
God, Kelsey.

1081
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,650
Kelsey, where's Dad?

1082
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:26,640
It's okay.

1083
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,260
- Kelsey, where is Dad?
- It's okay, It's over, It's okay.

1084
01:35:32,520 --> 01:35:34,820
- Kelsey, where is my dad?
- Freeze, don't fucking move.

1085
01:35:34,890 --> 01:35:37,690
- Drop the weapon.
- It's Okay, I'm Buffalo PD, I called it in.

1086
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:40,120
Get a medic down here.

1087
01:35:43,630 --> 01:35:46,360
We have a possible cardiac arrhythmia,
you need a defibrillator.

1088
01:36:04,420 --> 01:36:05,650
What the hell is this?

1089
01:36:07,090 --> 01:36:08,460
It's a baby factory.

1090
01:36:09,730 --> 01:36:11,020
Where are the babies?

1091
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:14,390
Allright, look up for me.

1092
01:36:15,030 --> 01:36:18,490
Down, left, straight forward.

1093
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:24,000
Until the guys from trauma get here,
if you need anything just let me know, okay?

1094
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,780
Jimmy, lets get another blanket back here.

1095
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:33,130
You called the Fletchers.
Please leave us a message.

1096
01:37:36,180 --> 01:37:37,150
Hey It's me.

1097
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:40,870
I wanted to call and apologize
for not being there at the funeral.

1098
01:37:41,450 --> 01:37:43,920
I just ... I couldn't.

1099
01:37:45,490 --> 01:37:46,850
Mike was my partner.

1100
01:37:48,090 --> 01:37:50,150
My responsibility.
He was also ...

1101
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,560
My friend.
And I'm just so sorry ...

1102
01:37:54,900 --> 01:37:55,690
Abby ...

1103
01:37:57,800 --> 01:37:59,670
Your dad knew you were pregnant.

1104
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:02,340
Honestly, he was so excited ...

1105
01:38:03,210 --> 01:38:05,200
I know you're probably
scared to death right now.

1106
01:38:07,240 --> 01:38:08,680
But you are going to be a mom.

1107
01:38:09,880 --> 01:38:12,140
And it will bring you more joy
than you could ever imagine.

1108
01:38:15,850 --> 01:38:16,980
I love you guys.

1109
01:38:37,780 --> 01:38:38,830
Hi everybody.

1110
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,810
Welcome home.

1111
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:44,370
Welcome home everybody.

1112
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:56,320
Mrs Hamilton, you're here!
Welcome to our little patch of paradise.

1113
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:59,960
- We made it, finally.
- God.

1114
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:02,520
She's adorable.

1115
01:39:03,730 --> 01:39:05,670
You are going to love it here,
I can tell.

1116
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:10,040
Good schools, quiet neighborhood,
just a great place for a young family.

1117
01:39:10,210 --> 01:39:12,510
That's sounds exactly like
what we've been looking for.

1118
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:14,200
Well then come on in for Pete's sake.

1119
01:39:14,280 --> 01:39:16,540
Let me show you what we've been
talking about all this time.

1120
01:39:16,850 --> 01:39:17,840
Where do you want to start?

1121
01:39:18,780 --> 01:39:20,550
Why don't we start with the nursery?

1122
01:39:20,820 --> 01:39:21,810
Okay!

1123
01:39:23,120 --> 01:39:24,710
- I'll be In, In just a second.
- Allright.

1124
01:39:42,870 --> 01:39:44,140
But you are going to be a mom.

1125
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:47,680
And that will bring you more joy
than you could ever imagine.

1126
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:49,680
I love you guys.

1127
01:39:55,090 --> 01:39:56,210
I love you guys.
