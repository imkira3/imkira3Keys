-== [ www.OpenSubtitles.com ] ==-

2
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,238
I remember.

3
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,351
I remember everything.

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,911
Captain Webb.

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,069
Good morning.

6
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,994
Has everything
been explained to you?

7
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,440
Yes, sir.

8
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,674
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

9
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,991
I'll be whoever
you need me to be, sir.

10
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,070
You knew exactly
what it meant for you

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,392
if you chose to stay.

12
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,636
You can't outrun
what you did, Jason.

13
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,916
You made yourself
into who you are.

14
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,592
Eventually you're gonna
have to face the fact.

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,797
You volunteered.

16
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,834
Christian Dassault
made a reservation.

17
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,275
Heather Lee.

18
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,470
Ma'am,
we have a device

19
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,558
issued to a stay-behind team
in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.

20
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,275
Marked on our
inventory as destroyed.

21
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,915
It's knocking on
our front door.

22
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,275
What's the status?

23
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,516
Whoever it is,
is just sitting there idle.

24
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,751
There's no
outbound traffic, nothing.

25
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,120
Move.

26
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,192
They've found a back door.

27
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,953
We need the reverse shell.
I'm gonna locate the source.

28
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
I'm working on it.

29
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,118
Okay, people, we have a major
breach of our classified mainframe.

30
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,236
Drop everything you're doing,
get on it right now!

31
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,592
Ma'am, I'm sending you
the shell.

32
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,796
Got it.

33
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,438
- Need it right now?
- Yeah.

34
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,016
- Getting IP.
- Where's that traceroute?

35
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,632
Unknown user. Monitoring.

36
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,477
Reykjavik.

37
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,474
SecOps hacking camp.

38
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,788
Kill the power
to the building.

39
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,456
Get into that power grid now.

40
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,520
Yes, sir.

41
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,176
I've got the power
to the building.

42
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,235
Stand by.

43
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,912
Ten seconds.

44
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,240
Let's get
on top of this.

45
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,240
- Shut it down.
- Copy that. Shutting it down.

46
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Dewey.

47
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,918
We've just been hacked.

48
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,508
How badly?

49
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,238
Could be worse
than Snowden.

50
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,433
Is there any attribution?

51
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,629
We're working on it.

52
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,917
Lee says it must be someone with
a deep knowledge of our systems.

53
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,673
This could affect Deep Dream,
and Iron Hand.

54
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,559
I want a briefing in my
conference room in one hour.

55
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
Yes.

56
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,358
Did you get confirmation?
Yeah, there was a hack.

57
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,279
So are we exposed?

58
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,191
We don't know yet.
We're checking.

59
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,896
I want you to call Dewey.
Set up a meet in DC.

60
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,136
Aaron, we got a lot
at stake here,

61
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,176
maybe we shouldn't
rock the boat.

62
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,474
Just do it.

63
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,480
Hey, George.
We ready for the launch?

64
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,079
Heather, you know the Director
of National Intelligence?

65
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,037
Heather Lee,
Cyber Ops, sir.

66
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,593
Have you got
a name for us?

67
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,035
The hacker was
a former Agency operative.

68
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,355
Believed to be working
with Christian Dassault,

69
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,795
and previously
linked to Jason Bourne.

70
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,549
Bourne?

71
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,156
Jesus Christ.
What did they get?

72
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,033
Black-ops files.

73
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,793
From Treadstone
all the way to Iron Hand.

74
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,357
Iron Hand?

75
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,477
But that's not even operational yet,
for Christ's sakes.

76
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,319
Where is Nicky Parsons
right now?

77
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,999
On the move.

78
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,594
She left Reykjavik,
traveling through Bucharest to Athens.

79
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,638
Feels like a meet to me.

80
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, how are you
going to handle it?

81
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,915
We cut the head
off this thing.

82
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,678
Sir, I'd like to be
point on this operation.

83
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:35,674
You're not indoctrinated
for this material.

84
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,034
I'm already into it.

85
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,997
I embedded malware
into Parsons' download.

86
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,354
When those files are opened,
I can trace them.

87
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,799
Let me in.

88
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,709
I'll deliver Parsons,
the files,

89
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,792
and, if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.

90
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,949
Excuse me.

91
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,838
I appreciate
your enthusiasm,

92
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,271
but do not push your personal
agenda to the DNI again.

93
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,279
Understood.

94
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,828
All right.
I think you can help me.

95
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,118
I'm going to give you full
operational control on this,

96
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,078
and I will make
sure you have access

97
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,549
to any relevant
teams and resources.

98
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:30,229
And I want to know
every move you make.

99
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,720
Yes, sir.

100
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,152
Thank you very much, sir.

101
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Yeah?

102
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,632
I need your help, now.

103
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,757
I'm not finished here.

104
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,150
Jason Bourne is in play.

105
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,596
Where?
Athens.

106
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,989
Close your account in Rome.

107
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,159
Understood.

108
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,797
Lee got a hit
from a CCTV feed.

109
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,474
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour ago,
headed west across Athens.

110
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,152
I got two local
teams en route.

111
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,629
Any sign of Bourne?
Not so far.

112
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,393
He's involved in this somehow.
I can feel it.

113
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,590
Upload all
Athens data and feeds,

114
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,837
and activate
real-time processing.

115
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,960
Copy that.

116
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,308
Where are we?

117
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,879
Parsons' bus has just
arrived at Syntagma Square.

118
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,999
There's a demonstration in front
of the Greek parliament building.

119
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,439
I think she'll
use it as cover.

120
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,115
Deploy Alpha and Bravo
to the square.

121
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,200
Recon for Parsons in the
crowd outside parliament,

122
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,236
and any possible
rendezvous points.

123
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,469
Copy that, sir.

124
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,551
Sir, the Asset
has landed.

125
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,434
Alpha Team arriving now.

126
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,915
Copy that.

127
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,958
I have
the Alpha Team feeds.

128
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,189
Pull them up.

129
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,277
Athens police are reporting tactical
teams moving on the demonstrators.

130
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,954
Isolate all social-media
posts from the square.

131
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:53,109
Yes, ma'am.

132
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,793
Rewind Alpha One's feed.

133
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,911
Yes, ma'am.
Twenty seconds.

134
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,117
All right,
Bravo Two, Four, moving in.

135
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,713
What's wrong?

136
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,475
I hacked the Agency.

137
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,998
For Christian Dassault.

138
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,394
I got all
the black-ops files.

139
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,118
We're putting them online.

140
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,319
We need to move.

141
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Stop.

142
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Two seconds forward.

143
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,515
Blonde hair.

144
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Enhance.

145
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,389
Find her.

146
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,550
Nicky Parsons sighted in
Syntagma Square. Redirect south on Stadiou.

147
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,598
I told you, Christian Dassault
is going to get you killed.

148
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,238
We don't have
a choice, Jason.

149
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,629
It's started again.
A new program.

150
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,478
Iron Hand.
It's even worse than before.

151
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,198
What's that got to do
with me?

152
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,316
Because it matters.
It matters.

153
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,072
Not to me, it doesn't.

154
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,958
All that matters
is staying alive.

155
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,395
You get off the grid,
survive.

156
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,755
I don't believe that
and neither do you.

157
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,836
Look at yourself.

158
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,791
Look at what
you're doing.

159
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,394
You can't live like
this for much longer.

160
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,870
Jason, I came here because
I found something.

161
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,235
I found your father's name
in the Treadstone files.

162
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,999
He was an analyst.

163
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,753
He wasn't in Operations.
He wasn't near any of that stuff.

164
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,628
I'm telling you what I saw.
It looked like he was involved directly.

165
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,513
And there's more.

166
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,635
More about you.

167
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
What do you mean?

168
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,517
Before you joined the program,
they were watching you.

169
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,551
Watching me?

170
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,395
You've tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

171
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,119
You torture yourself
for what you've done.

172
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,953
But you don't know the truth
about what they did to you.

173
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,315
You need to
read those files.

174
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,397
Move.
They tracked you.

175
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,835
Alpha One has eyes on two targets.
One female, one male.

176
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Identify the male.

177
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,115
Copy that, sir.

178
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,475
Alpha One, we need an ID
on the male target.

179
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,960
We've got to get
out of here

180
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,395
before the police cut off
this part of the city.

181
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
Head north.

182
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,514
Meet me at
the statue of Athena.

183
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,272
I'll take them with me.

184
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,319
That's him.

185
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Now.

186
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,275
Stay with Bourne.

187
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,476
Clear to engage the target.

188
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,595
Copy.

189
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,910
Alpha Team, stay with the male.
You are clear to engage.

190
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,349
Come on.

191
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,996
Sir, Alpha Team comms
are down.

192
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,680
We've lost him, sir.
He's taken them out.

193
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,153
Find Parsons.
He'll come back to get her.

194
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,309
Sir, rioting is spreading.

195
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,437
The Greek government is
declaring a state of emergency.

196
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,280
Bravo Team,
we are retargeting Parsons.

197
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,871
We got her.

198
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,872
Split the team,
put her in a box.

199
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,958
A suspect matching Bourne's description
has stolen a police motorcycle.

200
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,599
He's coming for Parsons.

201
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,795
Where the hell
is the Asset?

202
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,949
Two minutes out, sir.

203
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,592
Parsons is at
the statue of Athena.

204
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,680
Copy that.

205
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,433
Bravo Team is down.

206
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,391
Sir, the Asset is
arriving on scene.

207
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,776
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.

208
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,030
Give me the feed and
direct comms to the Asset.

209
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,192
Engaging targets.

210
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,228
I'm accessing Athens
police tactical data.

211
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,509
I need eyes overhead.

212
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,192
Bring up
the satellite suite.

213
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,192
Sir, I'm showing a Misty and
a KH-12 satellite available.

214
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,077
Light up the 12.
Yes, sir.

215
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,513
Satellite video
feed is online.

216
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,080
Police have blocked
the road to the north.

217
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,270
The target will be
forced to turn left.

218
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,711
Another barricade
in 200 meters.

219
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,711
Target turning left again.

220
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,880
Bourne's heading
for the alley.

221
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:51,679
Left at the top
of the hill.

222
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Stairway.

223
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,398
Up the hill. Heading east.

224
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,999
Give me a strike point.

225
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,599
He's found a way out.

226
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,352
Two hundred meters
to your left.

227
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,829
19 Solomou.
Get to the roof.

228
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,456
Target should pass
within your line of sight.

229
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,152
19 Solomou. Copy.

230
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,635
Focus the satellites
on these coordinates.

231
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,696
And give me a lock on the
motorcycle when it gets there.

232
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,755
Copy that.

233
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,760
I've got the targets.
They're approaching Omonia from Fidiou.

234
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,279
Look west.

235
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,509
The long boulevard.

236
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,395
Coming at you
in 55 seconds.

237
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,833
Copy that.

238
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,398
The Asset is online.

239
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,118
Target's with you
in 15 seconds.

240
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,119
Five seconds.

241
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,069
Contact.

242
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,229
Stay low!

243
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,313
Find a shot.

244
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,715
Hold on!

245
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,792
Targets are down.

246
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,680
Where's Bourne?

247
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,113
Ma'am, a police helicopter
spotted

248
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,536
three bodies on
the roof near the Asset.

249
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,312
A tactical team's
on its way.

250
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,395
Nicky?

251
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,309
Don't move!

252
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,950
Athens police have
entered the building.

253
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,719
Asset, you need to
get out of there.

254
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,074
Negative.

255
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,431
We don't even know
if Bourne's alive.

256
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,398
You want to
lose this guy?

257
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,869
This is Director Dewey.

258
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,632
You have 20 seconds.

259
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,393
Hold on, Nicky.

260
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,391
I'm going to
get you to cover.

261
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,789
No.

262
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,389
No.

263
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,356
No, don't.

264
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,074
I'm coming.

265
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,350
Get a location on Christian Dassault.
Yes, sir.

266
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,496
If he was working with Nicky Parsons,

267
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,317
he will lead us
to Jason Bourne.

268
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,994
And let me know if you get
a hit on that malware.

269
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,153
Sir, can I clarify
one thing?

270
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:57,960
Yeah.

271
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,671
Does the Asset
know Bourne?

272
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,271
Why would you
ask me that?

273
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,839
His behavior
on the rooftop.

274
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,911
It suggested a connection.

275
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,191
The last time
Bourne came back,

276
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,032
he exposed
the Blackbriar program.

277
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,320
It compromised
active operations.

278
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:19,513
The Asset was
in Syria undercover.

279
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,028
He was captured, tortured,

280
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,351
and it took two damn
years to get him out.

281
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,554
So you think that's why
Bourne wants the files?

282
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,868
To go public again?

283
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,632
I have no idea
why he came back.

284
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,631
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.

285
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,789
We can't let that happen.

286
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,069
So, you give me a call
soon as you hear anything.

287
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,754
Yes, sir.

288
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,711
And now, the
founder and chairman of Deep Dream,

289
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,234
Aaron Kalloor.

290
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,400
Hi.

291
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,680
Uh...

292
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,080
You all know
why we're here.

293
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,917
We're gonna be
unveiling a new platform.

294
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,116
We think it is
a bold new step

295
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,840
to allow us to serve
our community better.

296
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:01,436
We're a community right now that is
transcending national boundaries.

297
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,432
And I think we're
1.5 billion users.

298
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,637
In a nutshell, as you know,
we have an ecosystem

299
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:18,518
of hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.

300
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,397
And what this
new platform will do

301
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,950
will be to integrate users'
data and preferences,

302
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,110
and use that information

303
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,159
to enrich and tailor-make
each unique user experience

304
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,629
in a way that is,
frankly, unprecedented.

305
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,473
Um, now, I can see some
journalists' pens twitching,

306
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,949
- ready to ask about privacy.
- Yeah.

307
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,349
This is a concern to many people,
and so it should be.

308
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,096
I mean, this is something
that matters to us.

309
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,111
And let me just say, uh,

310
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,078
I understand nobody wants to
feel like they're being watched.

311
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,315
So let me just tell you,

312
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,312
when you come to Deep Dream,
when you use our service,

313
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,152
no one
will be watching you.

314
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,960
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.

315
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,754
Enjoy your meal.

316
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,955
Thank you.

317
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,600
Congratulations.

318
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,200
I hear your stockholders were very
happy with that new platform.

319
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:33,511
And I heard
you got hacked.

320
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,752
We're dealing with it.

321
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,957
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.

322
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,589
I'm out.

323
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,988
Aaron,

324
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,392
you are an extraordinarily
gifted and perceptive young man.

325
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,953
When you agreed
to help us,

326
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,033
it was because you understood
the very grave threats that...

327
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,016
Do you have any idea of the
shit-storm I'll have on my hands

328
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,190
if this arrangement
becomes public?

329
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,754
I already took a hit with Snowden,
and you want more?

330
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,713
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.

331
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:14,315
Gathering metadata
is no longer adequate.

332
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,960
We need a back door
into your new platform,

333
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,758
and a way past
the encryptions.

334
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,195
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.

335
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,390
You don't get it,
do you?

336
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,792
Privacy is freedom.

337
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,120
Maybe that's something you
should think about defending.

338
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,456
You little prick, you didn't
believe in privacy or freedom

339
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,074
when we funded your startup,
turned you into a billionaire.

340
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,674
I paid you back
many, many, many times over.

341
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,150
And I was never comfortable
with any of this.

342
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,874
I'm out.

343
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,113
I'm done selling
out our customers.

344
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,918
But you would sell
out your country.

345
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,993
The truth is, we wouldn't
be having this conversation

346
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:54,277
if you didn't feel
personally at risk.

347
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,793
You talk about
a free Internet,

348
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,677
you tell yourself
you're saving the world,

349
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,040
but all you're
doing is making it

350
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,593
a much more
dangerous place.

351
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,870
And you're sure as
hell making this country

352
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,269
much more difficult
to defend.

353
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,955
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.

354
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,953
Accountable.

355
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:35,433
Bourne?

356
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,909
Everything on the table.

357
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,229
Open it.

358
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:01,949
Sure.

359
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,200
Bourne has surfaced.

360
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:38,640
In Berlin.

361
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,228
Get the Berlin team up.

362
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,594
Where is she?

363
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,751
She's dead.

364
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:01,640
She knew the risks.

365
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:04,793
I warned her.

366
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:07,238
She made a choice.

367
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,796
You exploited her.

368
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:28,509
Berlin team is mobile.

369
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,392
What do we have
on the location?

370
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,240
It's an address linked
to Christian Dassault.

371
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,395
Anything on Bourne?

372
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,677
Nothing yet.
I'm accessing CCTV now.

373
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,715
Sir, I've been thinking,
maybe we've got this wrong.

374
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,870
What if he's
not coming for us?

375
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,039
What if it's something
else?

376
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:51,834
You don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

377
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,393
We should
work together, Bourne.

378
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,835
You exposed
the Blackbriar program.

379
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:12,318
We're both after
the same thing, right?

380
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:16,234
We both want to take down the corrupt
institutions that control society.

381
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,471
I'm not on your side.

382
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,272
CCTV feed is online.

383
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,598
He's on a computer.

384
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,910
We have to stop this.

385
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,194
If he puts
those files online,

386
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,032
operations
will be compromised

387
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,235
and people will die.

388
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,548
Yes, sir.

389
00:47:56,760 --> 00:47:59,274
At least when you're done,
leave me the files.

390
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,554
These programs
have to be exposed.

391
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,511
People have
a right to know.

392
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,799
We need that computer.

393
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,273
There's a phone
in the room.

394
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:32,993
I can use it to
delete the files.

395
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,272
Got the phone.
Where's that team?

396
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,668
Five minutes out, sir.

397
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,480
We're running out
of time. Get there.

398
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,633
Listen to me, David.

399
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,398
I've done something.

400
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,474
Something...

401
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:57,118
...that came at a cost.

402
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,230
One day
you'll understand why.

403
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:03,951
I gotta get back
to Washington.

404
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:06,879
I love you, son.

405
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:00,559
They're fighting, sir.

406
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,629
One more firewall.

407
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:40,838
Files deleted, sir.

408
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,389
Call in.

409
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:22,112
Bourne,
my name is Heather Lee.

410
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,398
I'm not in charge here.

411
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,715
I wasn't here when
you went missing.

412
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:32,428
I can see you're going through
the old Treadstone files.

413
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,718
Retracing your history.

414
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,674
I know you're
looking for something.

415
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,749
Let me help you find it.

416
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:48,749
Give me that phone.

417
00:52:54,080 --> 00:52:55,308
Yes, sir.

418
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:00,348
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?

419
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:04,354
Jason, your dad
was a patriot.

420
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:07,000
He could see the threats
that America was facing,

421
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,430
and, like you, he chose
to serve his country

422
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,034
out of a profound
sense of duty.

423
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,874
He would not want to
see you harm the Agency.

424
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:18,758
You have to stop this.

425
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,511
And you have to
stop it now.

426
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,080
Sir, our ETA is...

427
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,552
He's on the move.
Be ready.

428
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,235
Take point!

429
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,355
On me!

430
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:11,839
The elevator.

431
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,871
We lost him, sir.

432
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:20,760
Malcolm Smith, contract only,
based out of London.

433
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:22,896
Ran all of Treadstone's
surveillance in the late '90s,

434
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:23,989
when Bourne was recruited.

435
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,549
Is he still active?

436
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:27,000
He's private security now.

437
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,056
Contact the Asset

438
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,674
and tell him I want him on the
ground in London in six hours.

439
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,512
I think that could be
a mistake, sir.

440
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,514
A mistake? Why?

441
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:40,876
There is an argument for catching
Bourne instead of killing him.

442
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:43,912
All right, let's hear it.

443
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:46,918
Bourne's been off
the grid for a long time.

444
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,514
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

445
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,955
He knows things
that could help us.

446
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,998
Bringing him back in
is the smart move.

447
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,633
And how are we
going to do that?

448
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,392
Albert Hirsch wrote
a psych evaluation

449
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,708
when Bourne
left the program.

450
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:02,599
He concluded Bourne is
still a patriot at heart,

451
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,874
and that leaving
the program

452
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,076
could come back
to haunt him.

453
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,592
And what are you
suggesting?

454
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,035
I watched Bourne
with those files.

455
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,232
Desperately
looking into his past.

456
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:18,551
And I think he's
at a tipping point.

457
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:21,279
If I could get
face-to-face with him,

458
00:56:21,360 --> 00:56:22,998
I think I can
bring him back in.

459
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,869
One attempt.

460
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,871
And if it fails,

461
00:56:27,480 --> 00:56:29,516
you do what you have to.

462
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,753
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

463
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,070
Let's give it a shot.

464
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:41,160
All right, do it.

465
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,600
Bring Bourne in,
or tie it off.

466
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:45,795
But this ends now.

467
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,035
Thank you, sir.

468
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,115
Sir, I'm sorry...

469
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:02,674
No, don't worry
about that.

470
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:05,989
Better get some sleep, kid.

471
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,033
You got a long 24 hours
ahead of you.

472
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:14,189
Yes, sir.

473
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:29,536
It's taking too long.

474
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:31,480
It shouldn't still be buggy
this close to launch.

475
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:32,616
Well, I don't think
it's buggy.

476
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:33,959
I think we've
changed some things

477
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,376
that's going to
change the parameters.

478
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,674
We're going to
have to go and...

479
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,136
Okay, well, we need
to change them back.

480
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,456
Amanda, can we get
that note over to Kyle?

481
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,549
Absolutely.

482
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,278
Look,
I think you're right,

483
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,828
I just don't think we want to...
I'm tired of waiting.

484
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,999
Mr. Kalloor.

485
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:50,195
What the hell is this?

486
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,117
Mr. Kalloor,
my name is John Burroughs.

487
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,872
I'm from
the Department of Justice.

488
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,040
I'm hereby serving you with
the enclosed complaint...

489
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,536
Really? We have to do this in public?
Issued by the US government

490
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,834
against Deep Dream
Corporation

491
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,638
for violation of
the Sherman Act.

492
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,790
This complaint
requires you to preserve

493
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:05,836
all personal and corporate
financial records

494
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:09,236
pending antitrust motions to
be filed in federal court.

495
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:10,514
Good day.

496
00:58:22,120 --> 00:58:23,189
This is Dewey.
Aaron,

497
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:25,633
it's a message.

498
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,616
And maybe we should
think about what we're doing

499
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:28,755
before it gets any worse.

500
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,156
So, you think if we give him
what he wants, it'll end there?

501
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:35,152
You know, I'm just saying
that maybe we should listen.

502
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:37,736
I want you to pull up
all the records

503
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:39,637
of all the meetings
I've ever had with Dewey.

504
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:43,516
All the records?
Even the off-the-books discussions?

505
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,754
Especially those.

506
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:52,111
We're going to Vegas.
I need an insurance policy.

507
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,160
Yeah.

508
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:15,639
Are you in London?

509
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:16,948
Yes.

510
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,757
Why are you sending her?

511
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,112
She serves a purpose.

512
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,394
I work alone.

513
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,913
Not this time.

514
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,751
Don't make this personal.

515
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:33,275
Bourne betrayed us.
It's always been personal.

516
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,470
You know who
you're dealing with.

517
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:38,190
You better make sure
you're ready.

518
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,560
Yeah.

519
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,319
There's something you
should know about Deep Dream.

520
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,118
But I need an assurance

521
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,912
that I have your support.

522
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,310
You got it.
What do you have?

523
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,155
Kalloor

524
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,033
is planning
something for Vegas.

525
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:51,680
Yes?

526
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,193
This is Jason Bourne.

527
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:55,274
I need to talk.

528
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:57,714
What about?

529
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,472
I don't work for
the Agency anymore.

530
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,399
Paddington Plaza,
15 minutes.

531
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,955
Bourne just called Smith.

532
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:35,233
They're meeting
at Paddington Plaza.

533
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,072
15 minutes.

534
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,752
We'll tail Smith
the whole way.

535
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:41,952
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne,
I'll approach him.

536
01:02:42,040 --> 01:02:43,393
Whatever you do,
stay contained.

537
01:02:43,480 --> 01:02:46,517
I don't want the Brits crawling
all over us, asking questions.

538
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,953
Understood.

539
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:57,674
Tracking device.

540
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:00,472
You'll hold on the south
side of the bridge.

541
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:03,518
I'll contact you
if I need you.

542
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,275
Sure.

543
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,560
You're the boss, right?

544
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:39,399
Subject is on the move.
Heading toward the canal.

545
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,311
Alpha Team,
take a parallel track.

546
01:03:42,720 --> 01:03:44,950
Bravo Team, follow
the subject from behind.

547
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,632
And keep your
eyes open for Bourne.

548
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,077
Bravo Team
tailing subject.

549
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,035
Let's go.

550
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,917
In 200 meters,
make a right.

551
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,319
Copy that.

552
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:11,113
Comms check.
Second channel. Do you copy?

553
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,353
I have you.
Where are you now?

554
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:14,589
Heading towards Smith.

555
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:17,555
No sign of Bourne.

556
01:04:59,720 --> 01:05:01,233
Subject has
turned east,

557
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,320
into an alley.

558
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:03,400
Alpha Team,

559
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,920
that alley leads to a footbridge,
which will bring him to you.

560
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,360
Copy that.

561
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,313
Bravo Team is down.

562
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:22,600
Sending you
updated route now.

563
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:26,193
You copy that, Smith?

564
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,640
Yes.

565
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,912
Bravo Team, why aren't you moving?
What's going on?

566
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,439
Bravo Team,
do you copy?

567
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,311
What's happening, Heather?
Where's Bravo?

568
01:05:57,840 --> 01:05:59,353
We're comms down on Bravo.

569
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,591
Alpha Team, do you have
eyes on the subject?

570
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,949
We have eyes on.

571
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,437
Alpha Team, sit-rep.

572
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:23,232
Alpha Team, report.

573
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:24,799
What's happening, Heather?

574
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,638
Alpha Team
isn't responding.

575
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:29,312
Bravo?

576
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:30,594
Still nothing.

577
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:33,000
You lost both teams?
Get a grip on this operation, Heather.

578
01:06:33,040 --> 01:06:34,040
That's Bourne.

579
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:35,913
Green-light the Asset.

580
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,233
Sir, I need more time.

581
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:39,514
We have no time.

582
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,031
Are you going to
give that order or not?

583
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,519
Sir, please.

584
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,511
You are too naive
to see the truth.

585
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:48,114
There's no
bringing in Bourne.

586
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,872
He has to be put down,

587
01:06:49,960 --> 01:06:52,030
and you obviously cannot do
what has to be done.

588
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,356
I am taking
operational control.

589
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,472
Asset, you have
a green light.

590
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,473
Repeat, you have
a green light on Bourne.

591
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:01,595
Copy that.

592
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:03,119
I'm on my way.

593
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,111
Asset, are you
on the move?

594
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:17,915
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

595
01:07:18,720 --> 01:07:20,039
Are you moving?

596
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:22,958
Heather, stay off this channel.
Let him do his job.

597
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:27,640
Left here.

598
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,474
- Get to Paddington Plaza, fast.
- Copy that.

599
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:14,514
In position.

600
01:08:24,440 --> 01:08:25,634
Locked in.

601
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:45,760
What's going on?

602
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,069
What's that noise?

603
01:08:48,360 --> 01:08:50,112
Multiple fire alarms.

604
01:08:50,280 --> 01:08:51,713
That's Bourne.

605
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:56,828
What do I do?

606
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,031
You stay there.
You do not move.

607
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:10,520
Leave the building
by the nearest available exit.

608
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,269
I can't stay here.

609
01:09:13,640 --> 01:09:15,039
You can't protect me.

610
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,917
I need you to stay
where you are, Smith.

611
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:18,589
You still have
line of sight?

612
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,114
I'm on him.

613
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:23,429
You're gonna shoot him

614
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,670
in a crowd when
he's right next to me?

615
01:09:25,920 --> 01:09:27,399
Stay where you are,
Smith.

616
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:29,432
You know why he's here.

617
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:30,709
He wants answers.

618
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,029
You've lost this thing.

619
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,029
I gotta get out of here.

620
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,839
Shit!

621
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:53,233
What the hell
is going on?

622
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,152
Bourne's got Smith.

623
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,348
Go after them. I'll come
around and cut them off.

624
01:10:22,360 --> 01:10:23,576
Smith, we know
you're with Bourne.

625
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,640
You have to find a way to
let us know where you are.

626
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,512
Why are you
taking me in here?

627
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:32,119
They've got to be
near the Plaza.

628
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,199
Jesus, Bourne!

629
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:40,320
God damn it!

630
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:44,397
What are you doing?
Take it easy.

631
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:45,629
Richard Webb.

632
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:47,512
Station Chief, Beirut.

633
01:10:47,600 --> 01:10:50,273
He was my father.
He started Treadstone.

634
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,669
He hired you to put me
under surveillance. Why?

635
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,512
Jesus!
Why did he hire you?

636
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:55,993
Don't say anything, Smith.

637
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,679
No. No.

638
01:11:04,920 --> 01:11:05,920
There's no
sign of them.

639
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:07,549
What do you want us to do?

640
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,318
Work your way
down the canal.

641
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:11,277
I'll circle around
and meet you there.

642
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,790
You followed me
to Beirut.

643
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:20,155
The last time
I saw my father!

644
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,559
Why would he
have you follow me?

645
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,997
It doesn't make
any sense. Why?

646
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,270
Don't give him
a goddamn thing.

647
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:27,949
Why?

648
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,591
Jesus Christ, Bourne!
I'm falling!

649
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,518
Bourne, please!

650
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,431
I can hear them!

651
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:43,589
Beirut.

652
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,877
I went there to tell him that
Treadstone had approached me.

653
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:48,309
But if it was
his program,

654
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,311
why didn't he
say anything to me?

655
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:52,879
I've done something.

656
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:55,079
Something...

657
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,159
...that came at a cost.

658
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,192
That was the day
he was killed.

659
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,917
They said he was
killed by terrorists.

660
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:09,715
He wasn't killed
by terrorists, was he?

661
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,837
Think about your family's safety, Smith.
You keep your mouth shut.

662
01:12:13,640 --> 01:12:15,312
The next bullet's
in your head!

663
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,599
Why was he killed?

664
01:12:18,520 --> 01:12:19,520
Why?

665
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,911
He was killed
because of you.

666
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,153
Your father,
he wasn't in Operations.

667
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,800
He didn't know we'd chosen you.
When he found out, he...

668
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,750
He threatened
to expose the program.

669
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,434
He didn't want you
turned into a killer.

670
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:46,589
Who killed him?

671
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:56,789
Who killed him?

672
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,199
Don't do it.

673
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
Where is he?

674
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,353
He's almost there.

675
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,670
We're gonna
stop this now.

676
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:12,473
No, please.

677
01:13:30,360 --> 01:13:32,032
Somebody help!
Call an ambulance!

678
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,120
Someone help!

679
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,071
He went off the roof.
Five floors.

680
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,833
He recognized me.

681
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,310
I'm going to make
sure it's finished.

682
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,478
Help's coming now.

683
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:49,754
No, don't get up, mate.

684
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,833
Step aside, please.
Step aside.

685
01:13:56,520 --> 01:13:57,800
Everybody step back.

686
01:13:57,920 --> 01:14:00,280
- Let us do our job.
- Please step back.

687
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:03,040
Did anybody
see what happened?

688
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,120
He's gone.

689
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:06,111
Oh, shit.
I'm going after him.

690
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:07,792
I'll work my way
down the canal.

691
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,836
No. You're done
in London.

692
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:13,353
What are you
talking about?

693
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,032
There's another
play to be made.

694
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,188
Now that he knows what we did,
he'll come for both of us,

695
01:14:18,280 --> 01:14:21,113
and that could be the
opportunity for something else.

696
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:22,948
This isn't about revenge.

697
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,189
Yes, it is.

698
01:14:24,840 --> 01:14:27,035
And it won't be done
until one of us is dead.

699
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,836
Get to the airport.

700
01:14:29,920 --> 01:14:32,070
We have a problem
with Iron Hand.

701
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,234
Copy that.

702
01:14:43,720 --> 01:14:44,994
Give me a sit-rep.

703
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,593
We've got nothing.

704
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:47,999
Keep looking.

705
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:56,313
Drive.

706
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,056
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

707
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,149
I wanted to talk.

708
01:15:04,240 --> 01:15:05,912
Where's Dewey going?

709
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:11,029
He's going to Vegas

710
01:15:11,120 --> 01:15:13,839
to speak with Aaron Kalloor
at a cyber convention.

711
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,673
The Agency recruits there
every year.

712
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,079
What's Iron Hand?

713
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,034
Dewey's new
black-ops program.

714
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:25,276
Full-spectrum surveillance.

715
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,954
Watching everyone
all the time.

716
01:15:28,040 --> 01:15:30,873
Dewey needs Kalloor's
cooperation to bring it online.

717
01:15:33,560 --> 01:15:34,560
Let me out.

718
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:37,955
I can help you get there.

719
01:15:42,480 --> 01:15:43,629
Why would you do that?

720
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,318
You and I have
different reasons,

721
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:47,356
but we both
want Dewey gone.

722
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:52,875
Here, take this.

723
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:08,998
I'll see you in Vegas.

724
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:35,593
Sir.

725
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:38,993
We're pinning Kalloor's
hit on a fictional jihadi shooter.

726
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:41,071
A 20-year-old
Iraqi national.

727
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:44,352
We created bank accounts,
travel documents, e-mails, phone records.

728
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:46,509
He'll look like
a lone wolf.

729
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:47,749
Any physical evidence?

730
01:16:47,920 --> 01:16:51,071
The Asset leaves the gun.
It'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.

731
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,910
Russell doesn't need
to know about this.

732
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,033
I understand, sir.

733
01:17:00,040 --> 01:17:01,712
Any news on Bourne?

734
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,075
Nothing.

735
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:07,190
He was always
gonna come for me.

736
01:17:09,920 --> 01:17:11,911
Well, if it happens,
we'll deal with it.

737
01:17:49,040 --> 01:17:50,360
What was the purpose
of your visit

738
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:51,719
to London, Mr. Michaels?

739
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:54,359
Business.

740
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,874
Welcome home, sir.

741
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:23,440
Thank you.

742
01:18:38,920 --> 01:18:40,672
Parking lot clear.
You're good to go.

743
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,120
Sir, we have a secure room for you,
right upstairs.

744
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:49,519
Enjoy your stay.
Thank you.

745
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,473
Hi, welcome to the Aria.

746
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:54,796
Heather Lee, checking in.
Okay.

747
01:20:01,160 --> 01:20:03,879
We have you in a lovely Sky Suite.
Number 2016.

748
01:20:04,720 --> 01:20:05,789
Enjoy your stay.

749
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:06,880
Thank you.

750
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,472
Aaron!

751
01:20:19,240 --> 01:20:20,468
All right, Aaron!

752
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:21,709
Deep Dream!

753
01:20:33,560 --> 01:20:35,471
Find Lee.

754
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,795
Tell her I want to see her
before we go on stage.

755
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,239
Yes, sir.

756
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:41,675
I want agents posted backstage
as well as the auditorium.

757
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,875
Yes, sir.

758
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:54,671
Coming through,
make a hole.

759
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:56,876
Make a hole, make a hole.

760
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,320
Gonna make
a quick stop here.

761
01:20:59,400 --> 01:21:02,039
Hey, guys. Hi. How's it going?
Aaron.

762
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,189
Good to meet you.

763
01:21:03,720 --> 01:21:04,869
Can I get one?

764
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:08,793
Thanks very much
for your hard work.

765
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,109
Thank you.

766
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:14,480
You're doing a great job.

767
01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:47,480
Yeah.

768
01:21:47,720 --> 01:21:49,119
You all set?

769
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:51,316
Checking
the departure route now.

770
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,311
You won't have much time.

771
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:56,991
They won't know where it came from.
I'll have enough time.

772
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,599
After you take care
of Kalloor,

773
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:01,136
I'll be standing,
left hand at my side.

774
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,195
You put a bullet in it.

775
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,356
It's better
if I'm a target, too.

776
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:06,714
Copy that.

777
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:47,360
Lee.

778
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,031
The Director wants a word
before you go on stage.

779
01:22:53,560 --> 01:22:54,834
Of course.

780
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,560
ID?

781
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,160
Thanks.

782
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,280
Ah.

783
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,520
Heather.

784
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:50,399
My protegee.
Strongest supporter.

785
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:52,712
You know, after what
happened in London,

786
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,353
I did not know
what to do with you.

787
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:56,829
I suppose we'll just, um,

788
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:59,388
write it off
to your learning curve.

789
01:24:00,120 --> 01:24:01,519
I'd appreciate that.

790
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,633
At least you can now
see that you never had a chance.

791
01:24:06,240 --> 01:24:09,038
When Bourne turns up again,
I'll deal with him.

792
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:10,712
Do you understand?

793
01:24:10,800 --> 01:24:12,392
Of course.

794
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,072
I agree completely.

795
01:24:16,960 --> 01:24:18,518
When we get on stage,

796
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:19,656
I'll handle all
the policy questions,

797
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,477
throw everything
technical to you.

798
01:24:21,560 --> 01:24:22,629
I'll be ready, sir.

799
01:24:22,720 --> 01:24:24,312
Okay, let's do this.

800
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,148
Badges?

801
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:54,389
Aaron.

802
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:56,360
Robert.

803
01:24:58,160 --> 01:24:59,798
You know Heather Lee.

804
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:05,875
Yeah, we went
to Stanford together.

805
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:09,154
Wow. How are you enjoying
life at the Agency?

806
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,994
Challenging. But fulfilling.

807
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:15,678
It's tough to stay true to
your principles over there?

808
01:25:16,200 --> 01:25:18,475
My principles
are just fine, thanks.

809
01:25:19,880 --> 01:25:22,256
Gentlemen, we're ready for you.
Follow me, please.

810
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,280
I'm going to enjoy this.

811
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,153
So am I.

812
01:25:39,720 --> 01:25:41,233
Thank you, sir.

813
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,152
Oh! Hi! How's everybody
doing tonight?

814
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,199
Welcome.

815
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:11,079
Welcome.

816
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:16,195
Welcome to tonight's
EXOCON Symposium.

817
01:26:16,600 --> 01:26:20,479
We are so lucky to have four
fantastic guests this evening.

818
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:23,878
The CIA Director,
Robert Dewey, is here.

819
01:26:26,600 --> 01:26:30,195
And a dear friend of mine,
and an old friend of EXOCON,

820
01:26:30,280 --> 01:26:34,990
the CEO of social-media giant Deep
Dream, Aaron Kalloor is here.

821
01:27:08,280 --> 01:27:11,989
Tonight,
"Policing a free Internet,

822
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:15,792
"personal rights
versus public safety."

823
01:27:16,160 --> 01:27:18,594
This is the great
question of our time.

824
01:27:18,680 --> 01:27:21,513
And the choices we make about
this will determine our future.

825
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,316
So let's just
dive right in, okay?

826
01:27:26,600 --> 01:27:28,033
Come on out here, guys.

827
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,869
Sir, you've got
an incoming message.

828
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,960
High priority.

829
01:27:33,160 --> 01:27:34,856
All right, guys,
I'm gonna have to take this.

830
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,996
I'll catch up
with you later.

831
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,080
Go ahead.

832
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:47,838
Thanks for having me. Hey.

833
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,954
It appears Director
Dewey is held up momentarily,

834
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,510
and I am being told that it
shouldn't be too much longer.

835
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:06,296
But we have a ton of stuff
to get into tonight,

836
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,656
- so we can start anyway...
- Brad?

837
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:09,318
Brad, could I
say a few words?

838
01:28:09,800 --> 01:28:11,472
Excuse me?
Can I get the ball rolling?

839
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:13,113
Oh, sure, man,
by all means.

840
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:15,316
Ladies and gentlemen,
Aaron Kalloor.

841
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,915
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

842
01:28:29,240 --> 01:28:31,549
Thanks a lot to Brad
and all the folks at EXOCON

843
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,232
for having us back,

844
01:28:33,320 --> 01:28:35,197
and to you guys
for turning out.

845
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:38,800
Before the Director
comes out to join us,

846
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:41,553
I just wanted to share
a few words with you guys.

847
01:28:41,840 --> 01:28:44,229
A long time ago,
I had this idea.

848
01:28:44,640 --> 01:28:47,234
Copy that. A beautiful idea,
to create a place, online...

849
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,753
Facial recognition
got a hit.

850
01:28:48,840 --> 01:28:50,876
Bourne was on a BA flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.

851
01:28:50,960 --> 01:28:52,439
It landed two hours ago.

852
01:28:53,480 --> 01:28:55,630
How the hell did he get
through immigration?

853
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:58,518
Someone issued him an Agency
security clearance on his passport.

854
01:29:00,680 --> 01:29:02,656
Well, it turned out
to be a pretty popular idea.

855
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:03,920
Um...

856
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:06,514
People from around the world
started using our service.

857
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:19,800
Well, first off,

858
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,953
this has all made me a lot more
rich than is probably healthy.

859
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:27,119
When I come on stage, take
care of Kalloor and the girl.

860
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,398
Copy.

861
01:29:29,520 --> 01:29:31,096
But, what I mean
to say is that, you know,

862
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:33,111
all this success
has come at a cost.

863
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:37,077
There is a cancer
at the heart of Deep Dream.

864
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:41,275
A guilty secret, and, um...

865
01:29:42,200 --> 01:29:43,760
I have to share it
with all of you guys.

866
01:29:43,840 --> 01:29:45,256
Son of a bitch
is about to take us down.

867
01:29:45,280 --> 01:29:46,840
Take out Kalloor
and the girl right now.

868
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:52,720
Whoa, whoa...

869
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,472
Stay there.
Okay.

870
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,950
When I was
starting out, I, uh...

871
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:01,315
I took money
to start my company.

872
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,911
Made a bargain with a
guy in a dark suit...

873
01:30:09,120 --> 01:30:11,395
...and now he's come
back to take my soul.

874
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:21,496
I see the shooter!

875
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:22,720
We've got eyes
on Jason Bourne.

876
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:25,296
He's still breathing.
Call an ambulance!

877
01:30:25,320 --> 01:30:26,320
Go, go!

878
01:30:27,640 --> 01:30:29,517
Let's go!
Sir, we gotta go.

879
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,793
Head for the exit!

880
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:48,678
This is Vasquez.
We're on Bourne.

881
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,029
Get the cars ready!

882
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,316
Get the cars ready
right now!

883
01:30:52,480 --> 01:30:53,799
No, take me
to the suite.

884
01:30:53,880 --> 01:30:56,176
Sir, we've got to get you out of here.
Bourne is on the loose.

885
01:30:56,200 --> 01:30:59,397
You heard me.
Take me to the suite.

886
01:30:59,480 --> 01:31:00,515
Yes, sir.

887
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:02,631
Take him to the suite.
Take him upstairs.

888
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:03,755
Get him upstairs.

889
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:04,880
Right now. Right now.

890
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,200
Up to the suite.

891
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,520
Let's go, right now.
Go, go, go! Yes, sir.

892
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:12,070
Come this way. This way.
Don't worry. Come on.

893
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:18,557
Out of the way!
Federal agent!

894
01:31:26,720 --> 01:31:28,517
Vasquez, sit-rep.

895
01:31:28,960 --> 01:31:30,279
Vasquez, come in!

896
01:31:33,080 --> 01:31:34,080
Hey!

897
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:53,816
Okay, we've got him.

898
01:31:53,840 --> 01:31:54,840
Sir, this is Collier.

899
01:31:55,000 --> 01:31:56,991
We've ID'd the sniper.
Shit.

900
01:31:57,080 --> 01:31:58,672
We're circulating
his photo now.

901
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:00,159
What about Bourne?

902
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:02,196
Hang on.

903
01:32:02,320 --> 01:32:04,416
Okay, Bourne is just leaving
the west service corridor,

904
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:05,759
heading for the lobby.

905
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,598
Copy that. Stay on Bourne.

906
01:32:10,280 --> 01:32:11,349
What?

907
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:12,856
We're still
looking for Bourne.

908
01:32:12,880 --> 01:32:14,677
And they've ID'd the Asset.

909
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,096
Go back to the first floor and
wait for further instructions.

910
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:35,712
Yes, sir. Copy that.
Copy that.

911
01:32:52,840 --> 01:32:55,035
Everybody down! Right now!

912
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:56,593
Down, move, move, move!

913
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:00,151
Out of the way!
Federal agents! Move!

914
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:25,998
Take a team to the northeast elevators.
I'll meet you up there.

915
01:33:33,800 --> 01:33:35,677
Bourne's on his way
up to you.

916
01:34:25,480 --> 01:34:28,199
You took a long time
to get here, Jason.

917
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:30,912
I know about Beirut.

918
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:33,239
I know what you did.

919
01:34:34,800 --> 01:34:36,438
It all ends tonight.

920
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,434
Be a lot easier
to do it right away.

921
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,512
You didn't
come here for revenge.

922
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,717
You came here because you
know it's time to come in.

923
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,276
Your father
created the program.

924
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,673
Didn't have what
it takes to make it work.

925
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:06,028
And you did.

926
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,433
You always did.

927
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,438
That's why you volunteered.

928
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:15,552
I volunteered because I thought
our enemies killed him.

929
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,632
I volunteered
because of a lie.

930
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,553
No, you volunteered
because of who you are.

931
01:35:21,640 --> 01:35:23,870
You volunteered because
you are Jason Bourne,

932
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,520
and not David Webb.

933
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,072
Thirty-two kills, Jason.

934
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,232
Every one of them
made a difference.

935
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,598
People all across this country are
safer because of what you did.

936
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:57,831
I'm trying
to find another way.

937
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:04,310
And how's that
working out for you?

938
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,997
You're never
going to find any peace.

939
01:36:15,720 --> 01:36:18,951
Not until you admit to
yourself who you really are.

940
01:36:21,200 --> 01:36:23,031
It's time
to come in, Jason.

941
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,359
It's time to come in.

942
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,194
I can't.

943
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:40,560
Not for you.

944
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,833
You were never here.

945
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,920
You don't have to
go after him.

946
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:31,873
This can stop now.

947
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,798
You have a choice.

948
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,376
- Let's go!
- Have your IDs ready.

949
01:37:59,400 --> 01:38:02,039
Have your IDs ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

950
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:05,873
Have your IDs ready!
Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!

951
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:15,951
Stand in a line. Las Vegas Police,
ladies and gentlemen!

952
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:01,113
BearCat SWAT truck
and unmarked black Dodge Charger

953
01:39:01,200 --> 01:39:02,520
stolen from
the front of the Aria.

954
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,910
Pursuit in progress.
Air support requested.

955
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,115
What was that ID?

956
01:43:25,080 --> 01:43:26,752
Stop him!
Block that road!

957
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:31,080
Oh, my God!

958
01:43:33,280 --> 01:43:34,280
Fire!

959
01:43:37,720 --> 01:43:38,720
Move out!

960
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:24,840
Move!

961
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,336
Next two units involved, identify.

962
01:44:30,360 --> 01:44:32,936
This is Air 1. Be advised, suspect vehicles

963
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,160
have crashed into the southeast
entrance of the Riviera.

964
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:47,896
We have an armed
suspect heading into

965
01:44:47,920 --> 01:44:49,911
the storm drain
south of the Riviera.

966
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:45,800
Aah!

967
01:46:39,760 --> 01:46:42,433
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

968
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:44,799
It's in your blood.

969
01:48:08,880 --> 01:48:10,393
Mr. Kalloor!

970
01:48:12,040 --> 01:48:14,536
Aaron! What were you going
to tell everyone at the convention?

971
01:48:14,560 --> 01:48:16,152
What are
you hiding, Aaron?

972
01:48:16,240 --> 01:48:17,240
Easy.

973
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,360
Get back.

974
01:48:18,400 --> 01:48:20,016
Why did somebody
try to assassinate you?

975
01:48:20,040 --> 01:48:22,280
What's the cancer
at the heart of Deep Dream?

976
01:48:22,360 --> 01:48:23,640
I think it would
be inappropriate

977
01:48:23,720 --> 01:48:24,936
to pass any
comment at this stage,

978
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,920
but I look forward to
working with the authorities

979
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,552
to find out who
was responsible.

980
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:29,896
And to getting
back to Deep Dream,

981
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:32,229
where we can continue our important work.
Thank you.

982
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:34,920
Have you been
lying to your users?

983
01:49:06,720 --> 01:49:07,720
Sir.

984
01:49:17,760 --> 01:49:19,478
I wanted to say
I'm sorry, sir.

985
01:49:20,360 --> 01:49:21,952
About Vegas.

986
01:49:22,200 --> 01:49:25,909
Director Dewey's
tactics were unwise.

987
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,433
Unwise?

988
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:29,600
We're still
trying to come up with

989
01:49:29,680 --> 01:49:31,120
a narrative to
explain what happened.

990
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,513
That son of a bitch put
a spotlight on Iron Hand.

991
01:49:36,280 --> 01:49:37,838
On all of us.

992
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,956
Kalloor hasn't
gone public yet.

993
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,954
I know Aaron.

994
01:49:44,080 --> 01:49:46,150
There are still moves
we can make with him.

995
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:50,508
Tell me.

996
01:49:51,120 --> 01:49:53,998
Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.

997
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,671
People like Kalloor
are shaping the future.

998
01:49:58,640 --> 01:50:00,039
These are my people.

999
01:50:01,440 --> 01:50:03,590
I know how to deal with him.

1000
01:50:06,520 --> 01:50:08,431
And what do you want?

1001
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,271
When you appoint
a new Agency Director,

1002
01:50:11,360 --> 01:50:13,560
you're going to need someone
working for your interests.

1003
01:50:15,480 --> 01:50:16,629
Someone

1004
01:50:17,840 --> 01:50:20,070
empowered by you.

1005
01:50:23,640 --> 01:50:24,709
What about Bourne?

1006
01:50:26,240 --> 01:50:28,470
You still think
you can bring him in?

1007
01:50:31,280 --> 01:50:32,759
I have his trust.

1008
01:50:33,720 --> 01:50:34,869
After what we went through.

1009
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:38,393
I'll bring him in.

1010
01:50:38,480 --> 01:50:40,198
I'm certain of it.

1011
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,437
And if you can't?

1012
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:49,629
Then he'll have
to be put down.

1013
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,550
It's an interesting proposal.

1014
01:51:00,600 --> 01:51:01,999
You can pull over here.

1015
01:51:06,880 --> 01:51:10,190
Of course, if you decide
that you don't need me,

1016
01:51:10,280 --> 01:51:11,349
then that's not a problem.

1017
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,157
There are many other agencies
who would want what I know.

1018
01:51:44,960 --> 01:51:46,439
I brought you something.

1019
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:54,071
It's a cast from
your father's star,

1020
01:51:54,160 --> 01:51:56,151
on the Memorial
Wall at Langley.

1021
01:52:06,480 --> 01:52:08,277
I'm sorry for
what happened to you.

1022
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:12,559
How you were treated.

1023
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:15,279
But the people that
did that are gone,

1024
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,875
and things are
changing at the Agency.

1025
01:52:19,000 --> 01:52:20,558
What is it you want?

1026
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:25,717
I know you've
always been a patriot.

1027
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:30,318
That what happens to this
country matters to you.

1028
01:52:31,880 --> 01:52:33,791
We need you to
help protect us.

1029
01:52:35,440 --> 01:52:36,759
Come back in.

1030
01:52:38,920 --> 01:52:40,717
And we'll work together.

1031
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,119
Let me think about it.

1032
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:52,799
How will I find you?

1033
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,436
You still think
you can bring him in?

1034
01:53:41,560 --> 01:53:43,232
I have his trust.

1035
01:53:44,000 --> 01:53:45,638
After what we went through.

1036
01:53:46,680 --> 01:53:47,874
I'll bring him in.

1037
01:53:48,520 --> 01:53:50,033
I'm certain of it.

1038
01:53:51,000 --> 01:53:52,353
And if you can't?

1039
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:57,716
Then he'll have
to be put down.

1040
01:53:58,305 --> 01:54:58,310
