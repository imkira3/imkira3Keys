00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,147
Did that kill it?

3
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,065
No.

4
00:01:05,147 --> 00:01:06,147
That's how we kill it.

5
00:01:10,654 --> 00:01:12,155
The Book of Vishanti!

6
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:18,120
We can't let it take your
power. Get to the book.

7
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:19,288
How do we get across?

8
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,454
Jump.

9
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:24,876
Hold on!

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,047
No, no, no!

11
00:02:08,961 --> 00:02:10,464
It's too strong.

12
00:02:10,631 --> 00:02:12,257
I can't hold it.

13
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:39,451
I'm so sorry.

14
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,286
This is the only way.

15
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:45,457
What're you doing?

16
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:47,543
I can't let that
thing take your power.

17
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,586
You can't control it.

18
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,130
But I can.

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,966
But we're friends.

20
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,426
You're killing me.

21
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,678
I know.

22
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:01,723
But in the grand calculus
of the Multiverse...

23
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,851
your sacrifice is
worth more than your...

24
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:30,187
Excuse me. May I?

25
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:31,355
Thanks.

26
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,960
Doctor Strange.

27
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,294
Doctor West.

28
00:04:55,546 --> 00:04:57,256
Haven't seen you in a while.

29
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:01,468
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied
being dust there for five years, so...

30
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,136
So were a lot of us.

31
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,516
While I was gone...

32
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,852
thank you for asking...

33
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:12,688
I lost both my cats...

34
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,276
and my brother.

35
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,989
I'm very sorry.

36
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,283
Thank you.

37
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:32,958
I guess what keeps me up
at night is wondering...

38
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,711
did it have to happen that way?

39
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,798
Was there any other path?

40
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,678
No.

41
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,682
No, I made the only play we had.

42
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,809
Well, of course you did.

43
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,563
The best surgeon and
the best superhero.

44
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,819
But you still
didn't get the girl.

45
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:51,245
Glass of red, please.

46
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,412
Oh, allow me, miss.

47
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,416
Little too on the nose?

48
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,252
What? For you, at my wedding?

49
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,045
Nah. I think it was perfect.

50
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:01,922
Congratulations.

51
00:07:02,089 --> 00:07:03,215
Thank you.

52
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,217
There's Charlie.

53
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:07,594
I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...

54
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:10,848
It's embarrassing, but
he's a big fan, so...

55
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,057
Hey, Christine.

56
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,060
I should've...

57
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,178
I wish I'd have been different.

58
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:22,234
I never stopped caring about us.

59
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,486
But I had to make sacrifices...

60
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,780
to protect you.

61
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:28,490
I'm sorry.

62
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,997
It was never gonna
work out between us.

63
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:38,625
Why not?

64
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,669
Because, Stephen...

65
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,130
you have to be the
one holding the knife.

66
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,259
And I always respected you for it,
but I couldn't love you for it.

67
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,906
How long you had that
one in the barrel?

68
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,311
Long time.

69
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,396
Yeah. I bet.

70
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:00,564
Look...

71
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,818
Truly, I'm just glad
that you're happy.

72
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,030
I am.

73
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:10,282
I really, really am.

74
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:11,825
Good.

75
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:13,911
Are you?

76
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,871
I'm happy.

77
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,456
Good.

78
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,249
You deserve it.

79
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:30,886
Oh, man. Look out! What is that?

80
00:08:32,596 --> 00:08:33,889
Dude!

81
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:42,563
Thank you.

82
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:23,604
Wow!

83
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:31,405
No, no.

84
00:09:45,294 --> 00:09:46,295
Look out!

85
00:09:57,306 --> 00:09:58,307
Do I know you?

86
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,452
Help!

87
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:50,169
You're welcome.

88
00:11:50,878 --> 00:11:54,131
You know it's ancient custom to bow in
the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme?

89
00:11:54,298 --> 00:11:56,341
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

90
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:03,556
Hold it, hold it!

91
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,376
That's incredible.

92
00:12:31,752 --> 00:12:32,794
Yeah.

93
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,176
Oh, God!

94
00:13:34,815 --> 00:13:35,816
Who's this?

95
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:37,252
Yeah, I was gonna ask
the same question.

96
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,610
Hey, kid.

97
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,255
What did that creature
want with you?

98
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:41,280
Where're your parents?

99
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,614
We'll take her back to the...

100
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,077
She took my Slingie.

101
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,037
She took your Slingie.

102
00:13:53,417 --> 00:13:55,210
Yeah, it was crazy, man.

103
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:56,920
Oh, my God!

104
00:13:58,422 --> 00:14:00,299
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

105
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,885
I just bust my ass trying
to save your life, remember?

106
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,347
Giant monsters I can
clearly handle...

107
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:10,767
but what bothers me is that last
night, you were in my dream.

108
00:14:12,144 --> 00:14:14,396
That wasn't a dream.

109
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,440
It was another universe.

110
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,737
How much experience do you
guys have with the Multiverse?

111
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,884
We have experience
of the Multiverse.

112
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,033
Most recently, there was an
incident with Spider-Man.

113
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:27,451
What man?

114
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:30,412
- Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider.
- Hence the name.

115
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:31,830
Gross.

116
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,077
Does he look like a spider?

117
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:34,165
No. No, more like a man.

118
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:35,334
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

119
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,781
- Yeah. Bingo.
- Out of his butt?

120
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,170
- No.
- No.

121
00:14:38,337 --> 00:14:39,671
Well, maybe, I don't know.

122
00:14:39,838 --> 00:14:40,839
Honestly, I hope not.

123
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:42,049
Super weird.

124
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,135
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

125
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:46,845
I'm from another universe.

126
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,823
How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?

127
00:14:48,847 --> 00:14:50,015
I don't.

128
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,392
I don't even know if you're
from another universe...

129
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:55,604
which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you to enlighten us.

130
00:14:55,854 --> 00:14:56,854
Gotta say,

131
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,239
of the two Doctor Stranges
I've met so far...

132
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,733
you're not my favorite.

133
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:02,443
Which means?

134
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:04,988
Does he not know Spanish?

135
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,908
I'm not sure he even
enjoys speaking English.

136
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,494
Look, I left a very
nice wedding...

137
00:15:10,661 --> 00:15:13,413
to save a smart-ass kid from
getting eaten by an octopus.

138
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,141
- Whose wedding?
- Now tell me... Christine's.

139
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:16,935
- You went?
- Holy shit, you married Christine?

140
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,793
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

141
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:18,960
No, I didn't. Yes.

142
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,505
You need to explain
to me what's going on.

143
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:23,757
Why was that octopus
trying to eat you?

144
00:15:23,924 --> 00:15:25,676
That thing was
trying to kidnap me.

145
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,179
It's like a henchman
who works for a demon.

146
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,015
All we knew is that they wanted
to take my power for themselves.

147
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:33,350
What power?

148
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:36,395
I can travel the Multiverse.

149
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:37,980
What?

150
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,357
You can physically move from
one universe to another?

151
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:41,775
How?

152
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,652
That's the problem.
I don't know how.

153
00:15:43,819 --> 00:15:45,070
Can't control it.

154
00:15:45,237 --> 00:15:47,239
Only happens when I'm
really, really afraid.

155
00:15:47,948 --> 00:15:51,535
Okay. And did Other Me know
how to defeat this demon?

156
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:54,663
Well, you guys knew of this
magical book of pure good...

157
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,875
that gives a sorcerer whatever
they need to defeat their enemy.

158
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,085
The Book of Vishanti?

159
00:16:00,544 --> 00:16:01,670
It's not real.

160
00:16:01,837 --> 00:16:04,131
It's a fairy tale.
It doesn't exist.

161
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,299
Actually, it does.

162
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,070
I found out in the secret book you
get when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

163
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,137
Unbelievable.

164
00:16:10,304 --> 00:16:11,597
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

165
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:13,515
No, I'm not the
Sorcerer Supreme.

166
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,522
Other You was Sorcerer
Supreme of his universe.

167
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,435
Right. Yeah.

168
00:16:16,518 --> 00:16:18,103
Although it does exist...

169
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,314
the Book of Vishanti is
said to be unreachable.

170
00:16:21,607 --> 00:16:22,941
It is. Except...

171
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:25,110
we reached it.

172
00:16:26,987 --> 00:16:28,864
Then the demon
caught up with us.

173
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:31,700
I thought you'd protect me...

174
00:16:34,578 --> 00:16:35,578
but you didn't.

175
00:16:35,621 --> 00:16:37,164
That was the fight in my dream.

176
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,083
That wasn't a dream.

177
00:16:41,126 --> 00:16:42,127
Prove it.

178
00:16:50,594 --> 00:16:51,970
It wasn't a dream.

179
00:16:59,228 --> 00:17:00,479
That means...

180
00:17:02,272 --> 00:17:05,067
dreams are windows into the
lives of our Multiversal selves.

181
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,904
That was his theory.

182
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,949
So, that recurring nightmare where
I'm running naked from a clown...

183
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:14,576
Somewhere out there, it's real.

184
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,496
Somewhere out there
I had a ponytail.

185
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,165
There could be more
creatures coming for her.

186
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,502
The power is dangerous
enough in the hands of a kid.

187
00:17:23,669 --> 00:17:25,149
Imagine if a real
threat acquired it?

188
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,050
It occurs to me, young one,
we don't know your name.

189
00:17:33,512 --> 00:17:34,680
America Chavez.

190
00:17:34,847 --> 00:17:38,058
Miss Chavez, will you
come with us to Kamar-Taj?

191
00:17:38,225 --> 00:17:39,434
You'll be safe there.

192
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,312
How do I know you won't
betray me like he did?

193
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,440
I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.

194
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,737
What do we do with him?

195
00:17:59,496 --> 00:18:00,956
That's gotta violate
an ordinance.

196
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:02,583
Ah, I've buried worse.

197
00:18:05,502 --> 00:18:06,742
The creature that killed him...

198
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:09,798
did it have the same
markings as the octopus?

199
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,008
Runes.

200
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,302
This isn't sorcery.

201
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:15,637
It's witchcraft.

202
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:18,640
Do we know anyone who's
faced such a thing?

203
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:22,978
I think I might.

204
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:26,356
Chocolate!

205
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,983
Hey! What did I say?

206
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,193
But we couldn't wait.

207
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,611
But what did I say?

208
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:36,116
Go wash your hands.

209
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:42,915
Mom, come on. We're
too old for that.

210
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,250
Oh, okay.

211
00:18:45,417 --> 00:18:46,502
You can tuck me in, Mom.

212
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,337
I will.

213
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:55,385
You know, a family is forever.

214
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,389
We could never truly leave
each other, even if we tried.

215
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,475
Mom, I changed my mind.

216
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,727
You can come tuck
me in if you want.

217
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:05,062
Okay.

218
00:19:09,024 --> 00:19:10,275
Love you.

219
00:19:40,931 --> 00:19:42,641
Apples, right?

220
00:19:43,976 --> 00:19:45,227
Eventually.

221
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,402
- Smells...
- Sweet.

222
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:55,529
I was gonna say real.

223
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,198
It's all very real, thanks.

224
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:01,159
I've put the magic behind me.

225
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:02,536
So I can see.

226
00:20:03,245 --> 00:20:05,789
Well, I knew sooner or
later you'd show up...

227
00:20:05,956 --> 00:20:07,958
wanting to discuss what
happened at Westview.

228
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:12,754
I made mistakes, and
people were hurt...

229
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:16,675
But you put things right in the
end, and that was never in doubt.

230
00:20:16,842 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm not here to
talk about Westview.

231
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:20,967
Then what are you here for?

232
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,264
We need your help.

233
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,310
With what?

234
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,478
What do you know
about the Multiverse?

235
00:20:28,645 --> 00:20:30,272
The Multiverse.

236
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:31,440
Vis had his theories.

237
00:20:31,607 --> 00:20:35,611
He believed it was
real, and dangerous.

238
00:20:35,777 --> 00:20:37,279
Well, he was right about both.

239
00:20:37,946 --> 00:20:40,574
We found a girl who can
somehow travel across it...

240
00:20:40,741 --> 00:20:42,242
but she's being pursued.

241
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,952
- Pursued by who?
- Some kind of demon.

242
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,079
One that covets her
power for itself.

243
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:50,501
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj,
and we've got our defenses...

244
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:52,419
but we could use an Avenger.

245
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:54,296
There are other Avengers.

246
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:56,983
Yeah, but given the choice between
the archer with the mohawk...

247
00:20:57,132 --> 00:20:59,259
and several bug-themed
crime fighters...

248
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:04,348
or one of the most powerful
magic-wielders on the planet...

249
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:05,849
it's an easy call.

250
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,101
Come to Kamar-Taj.

251
00:21:09,686 --> 00:21:11,480
It'll get you back
on the lunch box.

252
00:21:14,483 --> 00:21:16,610
What if you brought
America here?

253
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:18,695
Here?

254
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,032
Yeah. I know what it's
like to be on your own...

255
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,785
hunted for abilities
you never wanted...

256
00:21:25,744 --> 00:21:27,412
and I can protect her.

257
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:35,754
- You never told me her name, did you?
- No.

258
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:38,757
No, I didn't.

259
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:45,597
You know, the Hex
was the easy part.

260
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:49,309
The lying, not so much.

261
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:17,421
The Darkhold.

262
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,964
You're familiar
with the Darkhold?

263
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:20,966
I know it's the Book
of the Damned...

264
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:24,553
and that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.

265
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,388
I wonder what it's done to you.

266
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,932
The Darkhold only
showed me the truth.

267
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,728
Everything I lost
can be mine again.

268
00:22:32,895 --> 00:22:34,438
What do you want with America?

269
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,481
What do you want
with the Multiverse?

270
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:38,942
I'm going to leave
this reality...

271
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:42,154
and go to one where I
can be with my children.

272
00:22:42,321 --> 00:22:44,615
Wanda, your children
aren't real.

273
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:46,825
You created them using magic.

274
00:22:46,992 --> 00:22:48,619
That's what every mother does.

275
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,165
If you knew...

276
00:22:53,749 --> 00:22:56,168
there was a universe...

277
00:22:56,335 --> 00:22:58,045
where you were happy...

278
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,172
wouldn't you want to go there?

279
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:02,174
I am happy.

280
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:05,093
I know better than most what
self-deception looks like.

281
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,389
What you're doing is a flagrant
violation of every natural law...

282
00:23:09,556 --> 00:23:12,434
and if you take that child's
power, she won't survive.

283
00:23:12,601 --> 00:23:14,728
I don't relish hurting
anyone, Stephen.

284
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,064
But she's not a child.

285
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,399
She's a supernatural being.

286
00:23:19,566 --> 00:23:23,445
Such raw power could wreak
havoc on this and other worlds.

287
00:23:23,612 --> 00:23:25,030
Her sacrifice...

288
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,241
would be for the greater good.

289
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,047
Well, you can kiss
the lunch box goodbye,

290
00:23:29,076 --> 00:23:31,703
'cause that's the kind of
justification our enemies use.

291
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,372
Is it the one you used...

292
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:36,458
when you gave Thanos
the Time Stone?

293
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,632
That was a war, and I
did what I had to do.

294
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:46,093
You break the rules
and become a hero.

295
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,178
I do it, and I become the enemy.

296
00:23:49,513 --> 00:23:51,139
That doesn't seem fair.

297
00:23:52,766 --> 00:23:54,184
What happens now?

298
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:55,936
Return to Kamar-Taj...

299
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:59,231
and prepare to hand over
America Chavez by sundown.

300
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,567
Peacefully.

301
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:03,986
After that...

302
00:24:06,029 --> 00:24:08,448
You'll never see me again.

303
00:24:12,244 --> 00:24:14,413
And if we don't?

304
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,294
Then it won't be Wanda
who comes for her.

305
00:24:21,753 --> 00:24:23,797
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

306
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:35,934
The Scarlet Witch.

307
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,731
Wanda's gone.

308
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:43,567
She's got the Darkhold,
and the Darkhold has her.

309
00:24:47,237 --> 00:24:50,324
The Scarlet Witch is a
being of unfathomable magic.

310
00:24:51,366 --> 00:24:53,702
She can rewrite reality
as she chooses...

311
00:24:55,204 --> 00:24:57,664
and is prophesized
to either rule...

312
00:24:57,831 --> 00:24:59,833
or annihilate the cosmos.

313
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,170
She took over a whole
town using her mind.

314
00:25:04,546 --> 00:25:07,132
If she gets America's power...

315
00:25:07,299 --> 00:25:09,635
she could enslave the
entire Multiverse.

316
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:14,389
So, the person you
went to ask for help...

317
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,767
and told exactly where I am...

318
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:18,494
is the person that's
trying to kill me?

319
00:25:19,811 --> 00:25:20,854
Yeah.

320
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:25,150
Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.

321
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:27,861
Kamar-Taj must now
become a fortress.

322
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:04,189
Wow.

323
00:26:04,356 --> 00:26:06,859
It's the masters of the Hong
Kong and London Sanctums.

324
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:11,113
It's an honor to court death
alongside you once again.

325
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,488
The honor is ours.

326
00:26:12,614 --> 00:26:16,535
Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme
asks of us, it shall be done.

327
00:26:17,077 --> 00:26:18,704
Extra duty men, follow me.

328
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:20,914
It's ancient custom.

329
00:27:23,685 --> 00:27:25,687
Choose your words wisely.

330
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:28,148
The fate of the Multiverse
may depend on it.

331
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:29,358
Got it.

332
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,069
No pressure, then.

333
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:48,293
All this for a child
you met yesterday.

334
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,296
Wanda, you are
justifiably angry.

335
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,298
You had to make
terrible sacrifices.

336
00:27:53,465 --> 00:27:56,176
I blew a hole through the
head of the man I loved...

337
00:27:57,511 --> 00:28:00,347
and it meant nothing.

338
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:04,476
Do not speak to me of
sacrifice, Stephen Strange.

339
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:15,529
If you give me what I want...

340
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:18,365
I'll send you to a world where
you can be with Christine.

341
00:28:20,534 --> 00:28:24,246
The full might of Kamar-Taj
stands against you.

342
00:28:25,122 --> 00:28:28,166
Defensive positions, now!

343
00:28:34,756 --> 00:28:36,967
Do not dare to enter
these sacred grounds.

344
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:40,762
You have no idea just how
reasonable I have been.

345
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:41,763
Yeah.

346
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:45,118
Book of the Damned, calling yourself a
witch, conjuring creatures to abduct a kid...

347
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,394
I don't exactly call
that being reasonable.

348
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:52,399
Sending those creatures after
her instead of myself was mercy.

349
00:28:52,566 --> 00:28:56,486
And in spite of your
hypocrisies, and insults...

350
00:28:56,653 --> 00:29:00,741
I have begged you to
safely get out of my way.

351
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:04,203
You have exhausted
my patience...

352
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:09,791
but I do hope you
understand that even now...

353
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:11,502
what's about to happen...

354
00:29:12,878 --> 00:29:14,546
this is me...

355
00:29:14,713 --> 00:29:17,382
being reasonable.

356
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,644
Hold!

357
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,897
Hold!

358
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,829
Nailed it.

359
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,252
Reinforce the shield.

360
00:29:53,418 --> 00:29:54,419
Reinforce the shield!

361
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:56,421
Reinforce the shield!

362
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,026
She's trying to
get in their heads.

363
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:21,405
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

364
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:35,544
Run.

365
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,235
The shield is down!

366
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,073
Fire!

367
00:31:09,745 --> 00:31:10,745
Yes!

368
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:23,133
Take cover!

369
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:27,930
Fire at will!

370
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,109
Fall back.

371
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,320
Wong!

372
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:44,613
Get out of here!

373
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:51,578
Go, go.

374
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:52,913
Go!

375
00:32:33,078 --> 00:32:35,789
<i>America...</i>

376
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:45,257
You want the girl, you'll
have to go through me.

377
00:32:46,008 --> 00:32:47,009
Fine.

378
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,205
We gotta get you
out of here. Now.

379
00:33:58,664 --> 00:33:59,873
Wong, what happened?

380
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,625
Kamar-Taj has fallen.

381
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:17,139
Reflections.

382
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:19,141
She's using the
reflections. Cover them.

383
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,010
You gave all those lives...

384
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:55,888
just to keep me
from my children.

385
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:57,472
You took those lives.

386
00:34:57,848 --> 00:35:00,517
You cannot be allowed to
cross into the Multiverse.

387
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:02,728
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

388
00:35:03,437 --> 00:35:04,479
I'm a mother.

389
00:35:04,646 --> 00:35:06,440
Wanda, you have no children.

390
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:08,692
They don't exist.

391
00:35:08,859 --> 00:35:10,569
Oh, but they do.

392
00:35:10,736 --> 00:35:12,863
In every other universe.

393
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,282
I know they do.

394
00:35:15,991 --> 00:35:17,784
Because I dream of them...

395
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:21,413
every night.

396
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:28,921
<i>We're gonna show it.</i>

397
00:35:29,087 --> 00:35:30,214
<i>Mom, watch us. Mom!</i>

398
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:33,091
Go long. Got it! All right,
go on back, go on back.

399
00:35:33,258 --> 00:35:34,468
All right, yeah. Don't...

400
00:35:35,219 --> 00:35:36,303
Of my boys.

401
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:37,554
Billy, don't you dare! No!

402
00:35:37,721 --> 00:35:39,515
Of our life together.

403
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:40,807
- Here.
- Yes!

404
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:42,184
And then back to front.

405
00:35:42,601 --> 00:35:43,936
Back to front.

406
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,521
Can I have some?

407
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:46,688
Please?

408
00:35:48,106 --> 00:35:49,167
- Are you guys ready?
- It's okay.

409
00:35:49,191 --> 00:35:50,191
I love you, Mom.

410
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:51,443
Every night...

411
00:35:53,779 --> 00:35:55,239
the same dream.

412
00:35:56,657 --> 00:35:58,534
And every morning...

413
00:36:01,453 --> 00:36:04,623
the same nightmare.

414
00:36:07,543 --> 00:36:09,002
What if you reach them?

415
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,673
What happens to the other you?

416
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,134
What happens to their mother?

417
00:38:03,325 --> 00:38:04,535
You okay?

418
00:38:06,203 --> 00:38:07,496
You saved me.

419
00:38:08,205 --> 00:38:09,790
I hope so.

420
00:38:13,585 --> 00:38:14,625
Surprised you didn't puke.

421
00:38:15,128 --> 00:38:17,506
It's not my first
weird trip, kid.

422
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:20,467
So, this is New
York in the Multi...

423
00:38:22,511 --> 00:38:23,512
Yep.

424
00:38:23,971 --> 00:38:25,013
There it is.

425
00:38:31,562 --> 00:38:32,813
Crap.

426
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:36,400
Cut it out.

427
00:38:39,194 --> 00:38:41,655
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

428
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:44,408
We'll get you fixed.

429
00:38:44,950 --> 00:38:46,118
All right, America.

430
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,110
You gotta open a portal and
get us back there right now.

431
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:50,163
I don't know how.

432
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:51,456
You just did it.

433
00:38:51,623 --> 00:38:52,623
Not on purpose.

434
00:38:52,708 --> 00:38:55,627
Wong is back there alone with
Wanda, and I'm the only hope he has.

435
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:58,565
- I can't control my powers...
- You must be able to control it somehow.

436
00:38:58,589 --> 00:38:59,589
Even I could...

437
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:03,510
Sorry.

438
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:07,365
Well, what about this
universe's version of you?

439
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,099
Maybe she could
control her powers.

440
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:11,101
This universe doesn't have a me.

441
00:39:11,268 --> 00:39:12,936
- What?
- None of them do.

442
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:14,103
But how do you know that?

443
00:39:14,229 --> 00:39:15,772
'Cause I've looked.

444
00:39:17,232 --> 00:39:19,359
And 'cause I never dream.

445
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:28,160
That's okay, kid.

446
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,413
And even if you could get me back
there, I have no way of fighting Wanda.

447
00:39:31,997 --> 00:39:33,141
What about The Book of Vishanti?

448
00:39:33,165 --> 00:39:34,166
What about it?

449
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:36,627
Other You thought it could
stop whoever was after me.

450
00:39:36,793 --> 00:39:38,962
Yeah, well, good for Other
Me. He's not here, is he?

451
00:39:39,129 --> 00:39:41,924
I don't know where it is, so
unless there's another Other Me...

452
00:39:44,176 --> 00:39:45,511
We need to go find...

453
00:39:46,345 --> 00:39:48,805
Other Other Me.

454
00:40:20,671 --> 00:40:21,672
We go on red?

455
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:24,424
Rule number one of
Multiversal travel...

456
00:40:24,591 --> 00:40:26,009
you don't know anything.

457
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:27,678
Right.

458
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:32,266
It's red.

459
00:40:34,059 --> 00:40:36,228
So, what's rule number two?

460
00:40:39,523 --> 00:40:40,649
America?

461
00:40:43,443 --> 00:40:44,528
America!

462
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:46,572
Rule number two...

463
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,031
find food.

464
00:40:48,198 --> 00:40:50,158
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

465
00:40:51,118 --> 00:40:52,244
How'd you pay for that?

466
00:40:52,411 --> 00:40:53,411
It was free.

467
00:40:53,537 --> 00:40:55,789
Food's free in most
universes, actually.

468
00:40:55,956 --> 00:40:57,833
It's weird you guys
have to pay for it.

469
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,835
- Hey! You didn't pay for that.
- Right.

470
00:41:00,043 --> 00:41:01,128
Crap.

471
00:41:01,295 --> 00:41:02,504
Maybe it's not free here.

472
00:41:02,671 --> 00:41:04,631
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

473
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:06,758
All right, Pizza Poppa,
relax. She's just a kid...

474
00:41:06,925 --> 00:41:09,206
- She was hungry.
- Relax yourself, there, Doctor Strange.

475
00:41:10,387 --> 00:41:12,181
Where'd you get this
cape from, anyway?

476
00:41:12,347 --> 00:41:14,057
That feels authentic.

477
00:41:14,224 --> 00:41:16,119
It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.

478
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:19,521
You took this whole suit from
the Strange Museum, didn't you?

479
00:41:19,688 --> 00:41:21,481
- Strange Museum?
- You're a taker.

480
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,192
Why don't you take
some mustard, huh?

481
00:41:32,743 --> 00:41:34,119
Come on. It's not permanent.

482
00:41:35,287 --> 00:41:36,914
Like he'll stop
in a few minutes?

483
00:41:37,831 --> 00:41:39,333
About three weeks.

484
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,047
Those universes
we went through...

485
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,382
were we paint in one of them?

486
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,885
Yeah, you don't wanna
get stuck in there.

487
00:41:50,052 --> 00:41:51,595
It's really hard to eat.

488
00:41:52,846 --> 00:41:54,306
How many universes
have you been to?

489
00:41:56,808 --> 00:41:57,809
Seventy-two.

490
00:41:58,477 --> 00:41:59,811
Seventy-three,
counting this one.

491
00:42:01,563 --> 00:42:02,648
That's a lot.

492
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:05,609
<i>Memory Lane. Replay your
significant memories...</i>

493
00:42:05,901 --> 00:42:07,402
<i>now at a discounted price.</i>

494
00:42:07,611 --> 00:42:10,072
<i>We remember so you don't forget.</i>

495
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:18,330
This is pretty fancy.

496
00:42:18,872 --> 00:42:21,041
Did you have to take out
another student loan?

497
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:25,045
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys
that we operated on last week.

498
00:42:27,673 --> 00:42:30,551
So got you a little something.

499
00:42:33,178 --> 00:42:34,930
Congratulations.

500
00:42:35,514 --> 00:42:36,723
What is it?

501
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:38,392
Open it and see.

502
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:45,023
Christine, this is...

503
00:42:46,316 --> 00:42:47,985
This is amazing. Thank you.

504
00:42:49,611 --> 00:42:51,071
We don't have time for this.

505
00:42:53,907 --> 00:42:56,910
<i>Memory Lane. Replay your
significant memories...</i>

506
00:42:57,077 --> 00:42:58,745
<i>now at a discounted price.</i>

507
00:42:58,912 --> 00:43:00,831
<i>We remember so you don't forget.</i>

508
00:43:08,005 --> 00:43:09,423
Where's this?

509
00:43:11,383 --> 00:43:12,759
Home.

510
00:43:13,886 --> 00:43:15,179
My moms.

511
00:43:41,997 --> 00:43:43,457
America!

512
00:44:02,142 --> 00:44:04,311
You know, you were right.
This is just a waste of time.

513
00:44:04,478 --> 00:44:05,521
Hey, kid.

514
00:44:06,188 --> 00:44:09,149
That was the first time that
you opened a portal, right?

515
00:44:09,316 --> 00:44:10,317
Doesn't matter.

516
00:44:10,484 --> 00:44:12,027
It does matter. You
lost your parents.

517
00:44:12,194 --> 00:44:14,488
I didn't lose them.
I killed them.

518
00:44:14,655 --> 00:44:16,573
No. No, you did not.
Don't even think that.

519
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:19,493
Okay, I opened a portal with
the powers I can't control...

520
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,679
and sent them to a random,
probably deadly universe...

521
00:44:21,703 --> 00:44:22,847
- with no way to escape.
- Listen...

522
00:44:22,871 --> 00:44:25,290
if your moms are anything
like their daughter...

523
00:44:25,457 --> 00:44:26,625
they survived.

524
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:29,586
I'm sure you'll meet
them again someday.

525
00:44:33,799 --> 00:44:34,842
Not bad.

526
00:44:36,093 --> 00:44:37,553
Thanks.

527
00:44:39,054 --> 00:44:41,014
That woman in your
memory bank thing...

528
00:44:41,181 --> 00:44:42,474
that was Christine, right?

529
00:44:44,434 --> 00:44:45,978
Yes, that was Christine.

530
00:44:46,144 --> 00:44:47,938
- How do you know her?
- From Other You.

531
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,648
Were they together?

532
00:44:49,815 --> 00:44:51,275
No, they didn't talk anymore.

533
00:44:51,441 --> 00:44:52,442
He blew it.

534
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:53,610
Of course.

535
00:44:54,736 --> 00:44:56,530
Did you blow it
with your Christine?

536
00:44:58,031 --> 00:44:59,908
Yes, I guess I did.

537
00:45:00,075 --> 00:45:01,076
Why?

538
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:03,495
Complicated.

539
00:45:03,662 --> 00:45:06,224
More complicated than being chased
by a witch through the Multiverse?

540
00:45:06,248 --> 00:45:08,208
Yes, actually, it is.

541
00:45:48,790 --> 00:45:50,167
"Gave his life
defeating Thanos"?

542
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:52,336
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

543
00:45:53,587 --> 00:45:55,464
If Other You's dead...

544
00:45:55,672 --> 00:45:57,424
who's Master of the Sanctum?

545
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,390
Oh, shit.

546
00:46:15,192 --> 00:46:17,528
- You know him?
- Yeah. Mordo.

547
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:19,894
He was actually the first guy
who let me into Kamar-Taj.

548
00:46:19,947 --> 00:46:20,947
Oh, great.

549
00:46:20,989 --> 00:46:24,076
And then he snapped and dedicated
his life to trying to kill me.

550
00:46:24,243 --> 00:46:25,619
Oh.

551
00:46:25,786 --> 00:46:27,037
Great.

552
00:46:31,667 --> 00:46:33,961
I always suspected
this day would come.

553
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,128
You did?

554
00:46:35,546 --> 00:46:36,547
Yes.

555
00:46:37,381 --> 00:46:41,176
Because you always suspected
this day would come.

556
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:50,519
My brother.

557
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:55,858
All right.

558
00:46:57,943 --> 00:46:59,236
Come in...

559
00:46:59,403 --> 00:47:03,657
and tell me everything
about your universe.

560
00:47:08,996 --> 00:47:10,622
You go on red.

561
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,419
<i>And you're quite
formidable too, it seems.</i>

562
00:47:15,752 --> 00:47:18,255
A Multiversal traveler.

563
00:47:18,422 --> 00:47:21,592
Well, thank the stars you
brought Doctor Strange to safety.

564
00:47:21,758 --> 00:47:24,052
Well, just 'cause we jumped
ship doesn't mean we're safe.

565
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:27,681
Our Wanda has the ability to
conjure demons and monsters...

566
00:47:27,848 --> 00:47:30,184
to attack America
in other universes.

567
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:31,810
So she has the Darkhold?

568
00:47:31,977 --> 00:47:33,478
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

569
00:47:33,645 --> 00:47:36,273
Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold
in this universe, too.

570
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,442
I guard it here in this Sanctum.

571
00:47:38,609 --> 00:47:42,529
We would never risk a weapon that
dangerous falling into the wrong hands.

572
00:47:42,696 --> 00:47:43,697
Damn right.

573
00:47:43,864 --> 00:47:47,159
But if your Darkhold is anything like
ours, I'm afraid she can do far worse...

574
00:47:47,326 --> 00:47:50,871
than just summon monsters
to come after you here.

575
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:52,456
What do you mean?

576
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:56,793
There is a spell contained
within those pages...

577
00:47:58,337 --> 00:48:00,172
corrosive to the soul...

578
00:48:01,798 --> 00:48:04,301
a desecration of reality itself.

579
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:07,221
Dreamwalking.

580
00:48:09,264 --> 00:48:12,434
A Dreamwalking sorcerer projects
their own consciousness...

581
00:48:12,601 --> 00:48:15,145
from their universe
into another...

582
00:48:16,146 --> 00:48:19,066
possessing the body
of an alternate self.

583
00:48:21,985 --> 00:48:27,282
They may puppeteer this unholy doppelganger
and pursue their enemies from afar.

584
00:48:30,702 --> 00:48:34,915
The possession is not a
permanent link between realities.

585
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:37,668
But in the fleeting
time they Dreamwalk...

586
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:41,713
they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

587
00:48:44,508 --> 00:48:47,427
So it may not be a
demon that you face.

588
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,474
It may be the Scarlet Witch.

589
00:48:54,560 --> 00:48:56,061
Why didn't she do
that to begin with?

590
00:48:56,228 --> 00:48:58,480
Because that was her
being reasonable.

591
00:48:59,731 --> 00:49:01,371
What do you know of
The Book of Vishanti?

592
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:02,985
The Darkhold's antithesis?

593
00:49:04,111 --> 00:49:08,448
It can give a sorcerer whatever power
they need to vanquish their enemy.

594
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:12,786
I need your help
to get me to it.

595
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:17,624
I'm sorry, Stephen.

596
00:49:19,168 --> 00:49:22,880
But I hope you, of all
people, understand...

597
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:27,759
that it is not Wanda Maximoff
who threatens our reality...

598
00:49:28,886 --> 00:49:30,095
it's the two of you.

599
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:33,599
- Oh, God.
- What was in that tea?

600
00:49:37,477 --> 00:49:41,190
You son of a bitch.

601
00:49:51,950 --> 00:49:53,994
The Sands of Nisanti.

602
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:57,956
I'm only acting as you would.

603
00:50:00,792 --> 00:50:02,836
She's coming.

604
00:50:25,817 --> 00:50:26,944
Boys, it's time for bed.

605
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,737
Can we have a little
more ice cream?

606
00:50:28,904 --> 00:50:30,256
- Please.
- Please, please, please!

607
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:32,759
- A little more, please!
- Hey, don't make Mom out to be the bad guy.

608
00:50:32,783 --> 00:50:33,784
You know who's the best?

609
00:50:33,951 --> 00:50:36,328
- Who?
- 2003 Tigers.

610
00:50:36,495 --> 00:50:37,496
They suck.

611
00:50:37,663 --> 00:50:39,456
They're so bad they suck egg.

612
00:50:39,623 --> 00:50:41,291
No, they don't.
They're the best.

613
00:50:41,458 --> 00:50:43,252
- Doofus.
- Doofus 2.

614
00:50:43,418 --> 00:50:45,170
Triple infinity doofus.

615
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:48,632
Infinity infinity
googolplex quadruple doofus.

616
00:50:48,799 --> 00:50:52,219
Quintuple infinity...
Crazy doofus.

617
00:50:52,386 --> 00:50:53,887
Googolplex doofus.

618
00:51:45,230 --> 00:51:46,273
Mom?

619
00:51:51,737 --> 00:51:53,280
Yes, sweetheart?

620
00:51:53,447 --> 00:51:54,615
Where are you going?

621
00:51:58,452 --> 00:52:00,913
Just to take out the trash.

622
00:52:02,164 --> 00:52:03,707
Can we show you something?

623
00:52:05,834 --> 00:52:08,378
Mom, hurry, come on!

624
00:52:08,545 --> 00:52:09,880
Come on, it's important.

625
00:52:10,047 --> 00:52:11,047
Mom.

626
00:52:11,089 --> 00:52:12,424
You'll like it.

627
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:15,427
Come on. Hurry up.

628
00:52:15,594 --> 00:52:16,720
It's important.

629
00:52:17,721 --> 00:52:20,474
Okay, so, Mom, listen to this...

630
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:21,642
I'm gonna start it.

631
00:52:21,808 --> 00:52:22,809
No, I wanna start it.

632
00:52:22,976 --> 00:52:24,204
- I wanna start it. I want to start!
- No, I want to start!

633
00:52:24,228 --> 00:52:25,330
- No! I want to start.
- I want to start.

634
00:52:25,354 --> 00:52:29,691
Why don't you both start it...

635
00:52:29,858 --> 00:52:33,070
whatever it is, together?

636
00:52:34,238 --> 00:52:35,405
- Okay.
- Okay.

637
00:52:35,572 --> 00:52:36,823
- You ready?
- Yeah.

638
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,701
Three, two, one, go.

639
00:52:39,868 --> 00:52:43,163
<i>We like ice cream</i>

640
00:52:43,330 --> 00:52:46,625
<i>Like every child should</i>

641
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:50,379
<i>And if we get some ice cream</i>

642
00:52:50,546 --> 00:52:56,093
<i>We promise to be good</i>

643
00:53:23,871 --> 00:53:24,872
You're alive.

644
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:26,582
Yes.

645
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,126
But so many others were lost.

646
00:53:31,044 --> 00:53:32,421
Set me free.

647
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,089
I need to destroy the book.

648
00:53:34,256 --> 00:53:37,050
No. It cannot be you.

649
00:53:44,850 --> 00:53:46,518
Sara. No, no!

650
00:54:05,787 --> 00:54:07,206
Mom!

651
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:08,582
<i>What happened?</i>

652
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,252
- What?
- Are you okay?

653
00:54:15,088 --> 00:54:17,382
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

654
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:19,968
What?

655
00:54:25,807 --> 00:54:29,728
No, no, no.

656
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:51,875
I need the Darkhold's spells.

657
00:54:52,042 --> 00:54:54,503
You are the Sorcerer Supreme.

658
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:55,879
Tell me what you know.

659
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:59,466
You're gonna have
to kill me, witch.

660
00:55:00,175 --> 00:55:01,343
Not you.

661
00:55:02,761 --> 00:55:04,012
Them.

662
00:55:10,143 --> 00:55:11,311
Wanda, stop.

663
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:15,315
Wanda, please!

664
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,364
The Darkhold was a copy!

665
00:55:25,117 --> 00:55:26,326
A copy?

666
00:55:26,493 --> 00:55:27,786
Legend speaks of a mountain...

667
00:55:27,953 --> 00:55:30,622
with the wretched spells you
seek carved into its walls.

668
00:55:31,957 --> 00:55:34,626
It's there the Darkhold
was transcribed.

669
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:36,837
Mount Wundagore.

670
00:55:37,838 --> 00:55:39,173
Wundagore?

671
00:55:39,923 --> 00:55:41,800
No one has survived the journey.

672
00:55:46,180 --> 00:55:48,891
Perhaps we will
be the exception.

673
00:55:56,231 --> 00:55:57,608
Hey!

674
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:59,651
Hey!

675
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:13,999
This universe sucks.

676
00:56:16,877 --> 00:56:17,961
Cloak?

677
00:56:29,431 --> 00:56:30,432
Hey.

678
00:56:32,226 --> 00:56:33,477
Hey, lab coat.

679
00:56:34,228 --> 00:56:35,312
Where the hell are we?

680
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:39,770
Look, I don't know who you are, or what
you think you're trying to do here...

681
00:56:39,858 --> 00:56:41,902
- but these situations don't usually...
- Thank you.

682
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:44,655
Work out well for the nameless
scientists, so just...

683
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:50,452
Christine?

684
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:53,372
Hello, Stephen.

685
00:56:55,916 --> 00:56:57,042
Miss Chavez.

686
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,003
To answer your question...

687
00:57:00,170 --> 00:57:02,631
you are in a highly
secure research facility.

688
00:57:02,798 --> 00:57:04,925
The two of you, along with
your sentient cloak...

689
00:57:05,092 --> 00:57:07,052
are here for
surveillance and testing.

690
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:09,263
Testing?

691
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:11,932
Well, yes. You're visitors
from another universe.

692
00:57:12,099 --> 00:57:15,644
Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive...

693
00:57:15,811 --> 00:57:18,438
you may be carrying diseases we
just don't have treatments for.

694
00:57:19,231 --> 00:57:22,150
Hence, these amazing
polycarbonate fish bowls.

695
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,238
I assume I have you to
thank for these then?

696
00:57:26,738 --> 00:57:29,992
Yes. I developed those
using the Sands of Nisanti.

697
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:32,452
One of 838 Stephen's
magical relics.

698
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:33,619
838 Stephen?

699
00:57:33,745 --> 00:57:35,330
Is that some kind
of cyborg me, or...

700
00:57:35,497 --> 00:57:39,793
Our universe is 838, and
we've designated yours 616.

701
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:42,796
You guys sure must know a
lot about the Multiverse...

702
00:57:42,963 --> 00:57:45,132
if you got someone going
around naming realities.

703
00:57:45,299 --> 00:57:46,300
Yes.

704
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:48,302
Me.

705
00:57:48,468 --> 00:57:50,388
I'm a senior fellow with
the Baxter Foundation...

706
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:52,598
and I specialize in
Multiversal research.

707
00:57:54,892 --> 00:57:56,935
So, how'd you end
up working here?

708
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,062
Wherever here is.

709
00:57:59,229 --> 00:58:00,564
Well, I volunteered.

710
00:58:01,148 --> 00:58:02,524
At your funeral.

711
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:05,068
Thank you for going.

712
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:08,780
Your injuries, they're similar,
but they're not identical.

713
00:58:08,947 --> 00:58:10,199
It's fascinating.

714
00:58:15,954 --> 00:58:20,292
What were we to each
other in this universe?

715
00:58:23,962 --> 00:58:25,964
We never quite figured that out.

716
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:27,382
Yeah?

717
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:31,094
Well, that's something
we got in common.

718
00:58:33,889 --> 00:58:37,142
Christine, you gotta
let us out of here.

719
00:58:37,893 --> 00:58:39,603
Everyone's in real danger.

720
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:41,813
Look, I know you
don't know me...

721
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:42,980
And I don't want to.

722
00:58:43,482 --> 00:58:47,277
Whatever I was to you in your
universe does not matter.

723
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:49,613
Why not?

724
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:56,328
Because you're
dangerous, Stephen.

725
00:58:58,121 --> 00:59:00,624
Someone from my universe
wants that girl...

726
00:59:00,791 --> 00:59:03,502
and she's gonna rip this
place apart atom-by-atom...

727
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:05,087
until she gets what she wants.

728
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:08,715
So I don't care if you're from
the Avengers or S.H.I.E.L.D...

729
00:59:08,882 --> 00:59:09,883
We're neither.

730
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:17,015
Well, what then?

731
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:18,183
HYDRA?

732
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:22,437
The Illuminati will see you now.

733
00:59:22,604 --> 00:59:23,814
The Illumi-what-y?

734
00:59:31,864 --> 00:59:33,532
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

735
00:59:37,828 --> 00:59:39,246
It's gonna be okay.

736
01:00:08,775 --> 01:00:11,361
You couldn't portal us up there?

737
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:13,947
My magic can only
take us so far.

738
01:00:14,323 --> 01:00:16,617
Masters of the Mystic Arts
weren't meant to tread...

739
01:00:16,783 --> 01:00:19,161
upon the forbidden
grounds of Wundagore.

740
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:50,108
Eons ago, the first demon,
Chthon, carved his dark magic...

741
01:00:50,275 --> 01:00:52,694
into this tomb.

742
01:00:52,861 --> 01:00:57,616
These same spells were later
transcribed into the Darkhold.

743
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,552
There's no telling what soulless
monstrosities lie within.

744
01:01:59,261 --> 01:02:00,971
They've been waiting for me.

745
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:11,023
This isn't a tomb.

746
01:02:15,194 --> 01:02:16,778
It's a throne.

747
01:02:51,813 --> 01:02:53,524
Stephen Strange...

748
01:02:54,191 --> 01:02:56,818
you are now called
before the Illuminati.

749
01:02:56,985 --> 01:03:00,739
I, Baron Karl Mordo, the
Sorcerer Supreme, do hereby...

750
01:03:00,906 --> 01:03:02,032
"Karl"?

751
01:03:06,328 --> 01:03:07,871
Captain Carter.

752
01:03:08,038 --> 01:03:09,248
The first Avenger.

753
01:03:10,791 --> 01:03:12,042
Blackagar Boltagon.

754
01:03:12,209 --> 01:03:15,128
Keeper of the Terrigen
Mists, the Inhuman king.

755
01:03:15,295 --> 01:03:16,338
Blackagar Boltagon?

756
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,049
Hidigy hidithere.

757
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:23,387
Captain Marvel.
Defender of the cosmos.

758
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:27,474
And the smartest man alive...

759
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:30,227
Reed Richards of
the Fantastic Four.

760
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:32,437
Hello, Stephen.

761
01:03:32,604 --> 01:03:33,604
"Fantastic Four."

762
01:03:33,647 --> 01:03:35,107
Didn't you guys
chart in the '60s?

763
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:37,317
I'm sorry, is this
a joke to you?

764
01:03:37,484 --> 01:03:38,878
Well, there's a guy over there
with a fork on his head...

765
01:03:38,902 --> 01:03:40,279
so, yeah, a little bit.

766
01:03:41,738 --> 01:03:44,283
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't
engage you in conversation.

767
01:03:44,449 --> 01:03:46,118
Why? Does he have bad breath?

768
01:03:46,493 --> 01:03:48,328
This Strange is even
more arrogant than ours.

769
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:50,539
No, just more alive.

770
01:03:50,706 --> 01:03:51,832
For now.

771
01:03:53,417 --> 01:03:57,296
Stephen, your arrival here
confuses and destabilizes reality.

772
01:03:58,130 --> 01:04:01,508
The larger the footprint you leave behind,
the greater the risk of an Incursion.

773
01:04:01,675 --> 01:04:02,676
Incursion?

774
01:04:02,843 --> 01:04:07,014
An Incursion occurs when the boundary
between two universes erodes...

775
01:04:07,181 --> 01:04:08,390
and they collide...

776
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:13,187
destroying one or both entirely.

777
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:16,523
Your alternate self
created the Illuminati...

778
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,234
to make difficult decisions
that no one else could.

779
01:04:19,401 --> 01:04:23,113
Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you and the child.

780
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,907
So, before we vote...

781
01:04:25,073 --> 01:04:28,785
if you got anything serious
to say, now's the time.

782
01:04:28,952 --> 01:04:30,245
Yeah, I do.

783
01:04:30,412 --> 01:04:31,848
If it's Incursions
you're worried about...

784
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:34,499
do you seriously think I'm a bigger
threat than the Scarlet Witch?

785
01:04:34,666 --> 01:04:37,711
Oh, we can handle your little
witch if she decides to Dreamwalk.

786
01:04:37,878 --> 01:04:41,173
No. No, you cannot. Not unless
you give me The Book of Vishanti.

787
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:45,052
We appreciate your concern, Stephen, but
it's not the Scarlet Witch that we fear.

788
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:48,931
From our experience, the greatest danger
to the Multiverse, it turns out...

789
01:04:49,097 --> 01:04:50,724
is Doctor Strange.

790
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,560
Wait. Your Doctor Strange?

791
01:04:53,727 --> 01:04:56,355
Earth's mightiest hero
who died defeating Thanos?

792
01:04:56,522 --> 01:04:58,232
We should tell him the truth.

793
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:07,533
Our final member...

794
01:05:08,784 --> 01:05:10,619
Professor Charles Xavier.

795
01:05:12,496 --> 01:05:13,497
What truth?

796
01:05:13,664 --> 01:05:16,250
That's not how our Strange died.

797
01:05:34,017 --> 01:05:36,019
You're wondering
what happens now.

798
01:05:36,812 --> 01:05:38,063
No.

799
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:39,857
That I've already accepted.

800
01:05:40,524 --> 01:05:41,733
But I do wonder...

801
01:05:43,235 --> 01:05:46,780
when you could force America to
send you to any universe you want...

802
01:05:46,947 --> 01:05:48,699
why take her power for your own?

803
01:05:48,866 --> 01:05:50,617
You know it would kill her.

804
01:05:50,784 --> 01:05:52,619
For Billy and Tommy,
to protect them.

805
01:05:53,829 --> 01:05:55,163
What if they get sick?

806
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:59,376
In the infinite Multiverse,
there's a cure for every illness.

807
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:04,006
A solution to every problem.

808
01:06:06,383 --> 01:06:08,260
I won't lose them again.

809
01:06:08,427 --> 01:06:11,513
Try as you might, Wanda, you
cannot control everything.

810
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,223
But I can.

811
01:06:13,390 --> 01:06:15,017
Look around you.

812
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,895
It's carved in stone.

813
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:22,316
I was meant to rule everything.

814
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,031
But that's not what I want.

815
01:06:29,698 --> 01:06:30,866
I just want my boys.

816
01:06:31,033 --> 01:06:33,076
At the cost of a child's life?

817
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:38,207
Is there no peace in knowing that even
though you can't be with the ones you love...

818
01:06:38,373 --> 01:06:40,584
there are worlds where
you are together?

819
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:41,752
Is that not enough?

820
01:06:42,961 --> 01:06:43,961
No.

821
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,086
Our Strange did not
die defeating Thanos.

822
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:26,421
We were at war.

823
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:30,300
While the rest of us banded
together to try to stop Thanos...

824
01:07:30,467 --> 01:07:34,429
Stephen, as always,
chose to go it alone.

825
01:07:34,596 --> 01:07:36,306
He turned to the Darkhold...

826
01:07:36,473 --> 01:07:38,058
began Dreamwalking...

827
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:40,769
in hopes that our salvation
might lie in the Multiverse.

828
01:07:41,103 --> 01:07:42,354
And guess what?

829
01:07:42,521 --> 01:07:45,107
It didn't. But he
kept doing it anyway.

830
01:07:45,315 --> 01:07:47,192
One night, you called
us all together...

831
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:49,403
confessed that you had
been Dreamwalking...

832
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:52,865
and in your words, "Things
had gotten out of hand."

833
01:07:53,031 --> 01:07:55,242
You never told us the details
of what had happened...

834
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:58,579
only that you had inadvertently
triggered an Incursion.

835
01:07:59,079 --> 01:08:04,459
You, our friend, had caused the
annihilation of another universe.

836
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:07,254
Everyone in that reality died.

837
01:08:07,421 --> 01:08:08,422
Everyone.

838
01:08:08,589 --> 01:08:10,757
Stephen renounced the
Darkhold's evil...

839
01:08:10,924 --> 01:08:13,051
and helped us find The
Book of Vishanti...

840
01:08:13,218 --> 01:08:17,346
a weapon we did use
together to defeat Thanos.

841
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:19,683
But one final threat remained.

842
01:08:47,711 --> 01:08:50,130
I shall miss you, my friend.

843
01:08:54,009 --> 01:08:55,385
I'm ready.

844
01:09:03,393 --> 01:09:05,687
I'm sorry.

845
01:09:27,334 --> 01:09:28,961
Did you tell Christine?

846
01:09:30,212 --> 01:09:31,296
Yes.

847
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:37,886
The statue...

848
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:39,513
What about the statue?

849
01:09:42,515 --> 01:09:43,767
You built a statue.

850
01:09:43,934 --> 01:09:45,560
The world needs heroes.

851
01:09:46,353 --> 01:09:49,481
We made the difficult choice because we
knew what our Strange was capable of.

852
01:09:51,066 --> 01:09:55,237
What, perhaps, every Doctor
Strange is capable of.

853
01:09:59,074 --> 01:10:00,367
The building's been breached.

854
01:10:00,534 --> 01:10:01,994
No shit, genius.

855
01:10:02,995 --> 01:10:04,580
Status report on sentries.

856
01:10:06,957 --> 01:10:08,000
<i>Stop where you...</i>

857
01:10:08,542 --> 01:10:09,543
<i>Get back!</i>

858
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:17,050
<i>Stop where you are...</i>

859
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:18,427
She's heading for the child.

860
01:10:18,594 --> 01:10:20,387
Watch him. We'll
vote on our return.

861
01:10:22,139 --> 01:10:24,933
Stephen, should you manage
to escape this chamber...

862
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:27,102
you must guide America Chavez.

863
01:10:27,269 --> 01:10:28,604
What the hell are you saying?

864
01:10:28,812 --> 01:10:31,064
Save the girl and get
to The Book of Vishanti.

865
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:32,608
What? You have the book here?

866
01:10:32,774 --> 01:10:35,027
Yes. You built a waypoint.

867
01:10:35,194 --> 01:10:37,362
Charles, we cannot trust him.

868
01:10:37,529 --> 01:10:39,489
I believe we can.

869
01:10:40,240 --> 01:10:42,701
Just because someone stumbles
and loses their way...

870
01:10:42,868 --> 01:10:44,703
doesn't mean they're
lost forever.

871
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:49,166
We will see what kind of
Doctor Strange you are.

872
01:10:49,958 --> 01:10:50,959
Thank you.

873
01:10:52,461 --> 01:10:53,504
<i>Perimeter breakdown.</i>

874
01:10:54,588 --> 01:10:56,673
<i>All sentries engage.</i>

875
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,134
Everybody out.

876
01:10:59,301 --> 01:11:00,969
<i>- Intruder approaching.
</i>- Now!

877
01:11:03,263 --> 01:11:04,389
It's Wanda.

878
01:11:17,444 --> 01:11:19,905
<i>Ultron commands you to halt.</i>

879
01:11:22,032 --> 01:11:24,076
<i>Ultron commands...</i>

880
01:11:27,204 --> 01:11:28,747
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

881
01:11:33,293 --> 01:11:34,461
Oh, no.

882
01:11:55,941 --> 01:11:57,192
Wanda, stop.

883
01:11:58,026 --> 01:12:00,906
You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.

884
01:12:01,738 --> 01:12:02,906
Let her go.

885
01:12:06,076 --> 01:12:07,077
Please.

886
01:12:07,744 --> 01:12:10,789
I have children of my own.
I understand your pain.

887
01:12:10,956 --> 01:12:13,292
Is their mother still alive?

888
01:12:14,501 --> 01:12:15,502
Yes.

889
01:12:15,669 --> 01:12:16,670
Good.

890
01:12:16,837 --> 01:12:19,882
There will be someone
left to raise them.

891
01:12:22,509 --> 01:12:26,513
Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you
with one whisper from his mouth.

892
01:12:28,432 --> 01:12:29,433
What mouth?

893
01:13:27,282 --> 01:13:30,619
Take me to The Book of Vishanti,
so that we can fight her together.

894
01:13:30,786 --> 01:13:32,746
You are in no position
to give orders.

895
01:13:34,081 --> 01:13:37,084
My vote will conclude these
proceedings when they return.

896
01:13:49,513 --> 01:13:50,681
Haven't you had enough?

897
01:13:51,849 --> 01:13:53,267
Oh, I could do this all day.

898
01:14:29,636 --> 01:14:32,264
Get the hell out of my universe!

899
01:15:06,215 --> 01:15:07,841
They're not coming back.

900
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:11,220
And you just cast your vote
now to kill your friends.

901
01:15:15,098 --> 01:15:16,725
Not that that ever
bothered you before.

902
01:15:19,811 --> 01:15:22,064
You know, you hated
me where I came from.

903
01:15:22,231 --> 01:15:25,150
And I bet secretly, my
brother, you hated me here.

904
01:15:25,317 --> 01:15:27,277
You must've been so jealous.

905
01:15:27,694 --> 01:15:28,695
Do you know what?

906
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:31,049
I bet you were thrilled when
you heard I'd been corrupted.

907
01:15:31,073 --> 01:15:33,051
Hell, you probably gave me
the Darkhold to begin with...

908
01:15:33,075 --> 01:15:34,826
You know nothing
of this universe!

909
01:15:34,993 --> 01:15:38,622
I know that killing Stephen Strange was
your ticket to getting the Sanctum...

910
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:40,249
to becoming Sorcerer Supreme...

911
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:43,085
and to joining your little
circus of clowns, the Illuminati.

912
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:44,711
I'm ready...

913
01:15:47,756 --> 01:15:50,676
to cast my vote now.

914
01:16:55,908 --> 01:16:57,701
I think I'm beginning
to understand...

915
01:16:58,118 --> 01:17:01,830
why your Mordo didn't
like you very much!

916
01:17:04,249 --> 01:17:05,250
You're sealed shut!

917
01:17:15,177 --> 01:17:16,845
Okay. Get back.

918
01:17:28,106 --> 01:17:29,107
Whoa.

919
01:17:29,274 --> 01:17:30,274
Whoa.

920
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:35,864
Enough!

921
01:18:30,919 --> 01:18:32,963
Help me. Please.

922
01:18:33,130 --> 01:18:36,967
Wanda Maximoff, your mind is being
held hostage by your alternate self.

923
01:18:40,637 --> 01:18:41,763
Grab my hand.

924
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:45,017
Perhaps, if I can pull you
from under the rubble...

925
01:18:45,434 --> 01:18:46,685
the spell will break.

926
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:35,484
Hey! You all right?

927
01:19:36,944 --> 01:19:37,945
You okay?

928
01:19:39,404 --> 01:19:40,405
Hey.

929
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,700
- You all right?
- Yeah.

930
01:19:45,452 --> 01:19:46,453
Hey.

931
01:19:47,955 --> 01:19:49,414
She fixed him.

932
01:19:49,581 --> 01:19:50,749
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

933
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,019
Xavier said I built a waypoint
to The Book of Vishanti.

934
01:19:53,043 --> 01:19:54,043
Can you take us there?

935
01:19:54,086 --> 01:19:55,230
How am I supposed to trust you?

936
01:19:55,254 --> 01:19:57,374
I know what happened, and
I'm sorry for what he did...

937
01:19:57,464 --> 01:19:59,550
but believe me, The Book of
Vishanti is the only way.

938
01:19:59,716 --> 01:20:00,717
Yeah. Your way.

939
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:03,053
You sound a lot like
my Stephen right now.

940
01:20:03,220 --> 01:20:06,932
He had to be the one holding the knife, and
then that knife killed a trillion people.

941
01:20:07,099 --> 01:20:08,767
This Stephen is different.

942
01:20:09,601 --> 01:20:10,602
He is.

943
01:20:10,769 --> 01:20:12,609
It doesn't matter about
all the other Stephens.

944
01:20:13,939 --> 01:20:15,315
You're not like them.

945
01:20:19,278 --> 01:20:20,404
Smart kid.

946
01:20:24,950 --> 01:20:25,951
Give me your hand.

947
01:20:30,956 --> 01:20:32,416
Do not make me regret this.

948
01:20:32,583 --> 01:20:33,667
I won't.

949
01:20:35,127 --> 01:20:36,920
- Okay, can we go now?
- Yeah, follow me.

950
01:20:51,476 --> 01:20:52,477
Where's that tunnel go?

951
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:54,188
Under the river.

952
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:03,363
Go, go, go!

953
01:22:07,845 --> 01:22:09,847
Where did she go?

954
01:22:20,816 --> 01:22:22,025
I warned you.

955
01:22:23,026 --> 01:22:25,320
Other Wanda, if
you're in there...

956
01:22:25,487 --> 01:22:26,530
hold your breath.

957
01:22:36,164 --> 01:22:38,208
- Did you kill her?
- No, just bought us some time.

958
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:41,545
The Book's through here.

959
01:22:41,712 --> 01:22:43,072
But only Stephen's
ever opened it.

960
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:54,516
Shit.

961
01:22:55,934 --> 01:22:58,121
An enchantment that's specific to
me, something only I would know.

962
01:22:58,145 --> 01:22:59,897
- Wait. Stephen.
- Come on.

963
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,649
Come on.

964
01:23:02,816 --> 01:23:04,318
Stephen.

965
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:13,702
Yeah.

966
01:23:16,663 --> 01:23:17,664
Thank you.

967
01:23:18,290 --> 01:23:19,750
Sure.

968
01:23:25,214 --> 01:23:26,548
Open sesame.

969
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:00,249
Come on, kid.

970
01:24:00,874 --> 01:24:02,084
You got this.

971
01:24:03,836 --> 01:24:05,128
We got this.

972
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:08,590
Yeah.

973
01:24:16,640 --> 01:24:17,641
You all right?

974
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:18,934
Yeah.

975
01:24:21,311 --> 01:24:24,523
This is the Gap Junction,
the space between universes.

976
01:24:37,744 --> 01:24:39,204
All right, Book.

977
01:24:42,499 --> 01:24:43,876
Give me what I need.

978
01:25:02,436 --> 01:25:03,437
- No!
- No!

979
01:25:56,865 --> 01:25:58,158
My boys.

980
01:26:09,878 --> 01:26:11,518
This isn't what your
children would want.

981
01:26:27,521 --> 01:26:28,939
They'll never know.

982
01:26:29,106 --> 01:26:30,190
Maybe not.

983
01:26:30,774 --> 01:26:31,775
But you will.

984
01:26:35,737 --> 01:26:36,989
Oh, no.

985
01:26:37,155 --> 01:26:38,490
Oh, crap.

986
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:42,870
It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.

987
01:26:43,078 --> 01:26:44,121
Yeah.

988
01:26:44,621 --> 01:26:46,331
Or two realities collided.

989
01:26:47,457 --> 01:26:48,625
Come on.

990
01:26:49,084 --> 01:26:50,794
America doesn't have long.

991
01:26:51,211 --> 01:26:52,504
So where are we going?

992
01:26:52,671 --> 01:26:55,966
Well, if there's still a
sanctum in this universe...

993
01:26:57,092 --> 01:27:00,637
then there might be
another Other Other Me...

994
01:27:00,804 --> 01:27:03,307
and that's our best shot
of getting back to her.

995
01:27:15,777 --> 01:27:19,114
Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about Incursions.

996
01:27:21,241 --> 01:27:22,659
Whatever happened...

997
01:27:23,744 --> 01:27:27,206
this universe's you didn't do
a very good job of stopping it.

998
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:39,510
I'll tell him you said that.

999
01:28:39,945 --> 01:28:41,071
Hello?

1000
01:28:48,912 --> 01:28:50,163
Stop where you are.

1001
01:28:52,541 --> 01:28:54,585
How did you get here?

1002
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:56,670
By accident.

1003
01:28:58,672 --> 01:28:59,673
Who are you?

1004
01:29:00,674 --> 01:29:01,675
What are you?

1005
01:29:01,842 --> 01:29:03,927
I'm just one of us.

1006
01:29:04,094 --> 01:29:05,596
From the Multiverse?

1007
01:29:05,762 --> 01:29:06,972
That's right.

1008
01:29:08,682 --> 01:29:09,766
Prove it.

1009
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:14,521
We had a sister.

1010
01:29:15,063 --> 01:29:16,064
Donna.

1011
01:29:18,901 --> 01:29:19,943
But she...

1012
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:23,488
She died when we were kids.

1013
01:29:25,616 --> 01:29:26,658
How?

1014
01:29:28,076 --> 01:29:33,832
We were playing on
a frozen lake and...

1015
01:29:37,920 --> 01:29:39,838
she fell through the ice.

1016
01:29:46,178 --> 01:29:48,013
I couldn't save her.

1017
01:29:50,224 --> 01:29:51,892
Sounds about right.

1018
01:29:54,561 --> 01:29:57,022
But we don't talk
about that, do we?

1019
01:29:58,357 --> 01:29:59,525
No, we don't.

1020
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:03,779
Suppose your reality
wasn't always like this.

1021
01:30:03,946 --> 01:30:06,406
I suspect it was somewhat
like yours until...

1022
01:30:06,573 --> 01:30:07,574
Until?

1023
01:30:09,535 --> 01:30:10,953
Until I lost.

1024
01:30:12,371 --> 01:30:13,997
To whom?

1025
01:30:17,543 --> 01:30:18,877
What do you want?

1026
01:30:19,628 --> 01:30:22,130
I just want to get home.

1027
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:23,841
Yeah? Believe me...

1028
01:30:24,007 --> 01:30:26,927
I've been trying to leave
this place for a long time.

1029
01:30:28,095 --> 01:30:29,429
Darkhold.

1030
01:30:29,596 --> 01:30:32,349
You guard the Darkhold
in this universe?

1031
01:30:32,516 --> 01:30:33,559
Yeah.

1032
01:30:34,184 --> 01:30:35,227
For good reason.

1033
01:30:35,394 --> 01:30:36,395
That's a start.

1034
01:30:36,562 --> 01:30:39,606
I could use it. It could help me
to communicate with my universe.

1035
01:30:39,773 --> 01:30:40,941
Careful.

1036
01:30:41,859 --> 01:30:44,361
The Darkhold exacts
a heavy toll.

1037
01:30:44,528 --> 01:30:47,447
I don't mean to be callous...

1038
01:30:47,614 --> 01:30:50,492
but how much of a heavier
toll is there left to exact?

1039
01:30:50,659 --> 01:30:52,828
Not just on its reality.

1040
01:30:53,203 --> 01:30:54,454
On its reader.

1041
01:30:55,539 --> 01:30:57,499
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't
save your universe...

1042
01:30:57,583 --> 01:31:00,127
but maybe you could
help to save mine.

1043
01:31:03,213 --> 01:31:05,090
Are you happy, Stephen?

1044
01:31:06,008 --> 01:31:07,092
What?

1045
01:31:07,718 --> 01:31:12,347
Are you happy, Stephen?

1046
01:31:14,266 --> 01:31:16,602
It's the question that...

1047
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:19,771
Christine Palmer...

1048
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,232
asked me at her wedding.

1049
01:31:25,235 --> 01:31:27,738
I said, "Yes, of
course I'm happy.

1050
01:31:27,905 --> 01:31:32,993
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of
gods. What man wouldn't be happy?"

1051
01:31:33,744 --> 01:31:38,916
And then I came back to this
goddamn haunted house...

1052
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:40,501
sat down...

1053
01:31:42,169 --> 01:31:44,379
and wondered why I'd lied.

1054
01:31:46,673 --> 01:31:49,426
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

1055
01:31:51,261 --> 01:31:54,264
I was looking for a world
where things were different.

1056
01:31:56,433 --> 01:31:59,937
Where I had Christine,
where I was happy.

1057
01:32:02,064 --> 01:32:03,524
But I didn't find it.

1058
01:32:05,150 --> 01:32:07,319
All I found were more of us.

1059
01:32:09,279 --> 01:32:11,657
So I did those Stephens a favor.

1060
01:32:13,283 --> 01:32:15,911
You ever had that dream
where you're falling...

1061
01:32:16,078 --> 01:32:19,790
as if you've been pushed
off a tall building?

1062
01:32:22,793 --> 01:32:24,628
That was probably me.

1063
01:32:33,136 --> 01:32:35,722
The Darkhold exacts
a heavy toll.

1064
01:32:35,889 --> 01:32:37,349
Okay.

1065
01:32:38,267 --> 01:32:40,853
All the more reason to give
it a rest and let me have it.

1066
01:32:41,019 --> 01:32:42,437
Here's the deal.

1067
01:32:42,604 --> 01:32:47,401
I'll let you use the Darkhold
if you give me your Christine.

1068
01:32:48,151 --> 01:32:49,444
Yeah.

1069
01:32:49,611 --> 01:32:51,613
I don't think she's
gonna go for that.

1070
01:32:51,780 --> 01:32:52,781
No?

1071
01:32:53,907 --> 01:32:55,242
Didn't think so.

1072
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:24,493
Hang on, we're coming.

1073
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:32,918
What are you doing
with the Darkhold?

1074
01:36:35,045 --> 01:36:36,964
Are you going to Dreamwalk?

1075
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:39,383
It's a little bit more
than just Dreamwalking.

1076
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:41,844
All you Stranges,
you're the same.

1077
01:36:42,010 --> 01:36:43,053
I know.

1078
01:36:45,138 --> 01:36:46,223
You're right.

1079
01:36:47,057 --> 01:36:48,392
We are all the same.

1080
01:36:49,434 --> 01:36:50,853
But right now,
that kid needs me.

1081
01:36:51,019 --> 01:36:54,690
And I can't do any of
this without your help.

1082
01:36:55,566 --> 01:36:58,110
While I'm under, I need
you to protect my body...

1083
01:36:58,277 --> 01:37:00,279
in case they attack
me for trespassing.

1084
01:37:00,612 --> 01:37:01,780
Who's "they"?

1085
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,742
The souls of the damned.

1086
01:37:27,973 --> 01:37:28,974
Okay.

1087
01:37:29,141 --> 01:37:33,145
But doesn't a version of you
need to live in that universe...

1088
01:37:33,312 --> 01:37:35,105
so that you can
Dreamwalk into them?

1089
01:37:36,773 --> 01:37:38,609
Who said they had to be living?

1090
01:38:52,432 --> 01:38:54,226
Stephen Strange...

1091
01:38:54,393 --> 01:38:57,104
possessing a dead
body is forbidden.

1092
01:38:57,271 --> 01:38:58,897
Forbidden.

1093
01:38:59,064 --> 01:39:00,482
Trespasser!

1094
01:39:00,649 --> 01:39:02,109
Trespasser!

1095
01:39:03,527 --> 01:39:07,739
Cease your Dreamwalk, or face
the eternal consequences.

1096
01:39:16,665 --> 01:39:17,791
<i>Stephen!</i>

1097
01:39:18,458 --> 01:39:20,294
They're pulling me down.

1098
01:39:21,795 --> 01:39:23,005
<i>Stephen!</i>

1099
01:39:30,721 --> 01:39:32,222
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1100
01:39:33,015 --> 01:39:34,016
Where are you?

1101
01:40:00,709 --> 01:40:02,628
The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

1102
01:40:13,347 --> 01:40:14,348
Go back to hell.

1103
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:28,070
Stephen.

1104
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:30,864
I've got you.

1105
01:40:32,074 --> 01:40:34,451
You're a Master of
the Mystic Arts.

1106
01:40:34,868 --> 01:40:36,370
They're spirits.

1107
01:40:36,537 --> 01:40:37,537
Use them.

1108
01:40:42,793 --> 01:40:43,794
Use them.

1109
01:40:46,213 --> 01:40:47,214
Use them.

1110
01:41:03,897 --> 01:41:05,190
No!

1111
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:00,119
Come on!

1112
01:42:35,030 --> 01:42:36,323
Strange!

1113
01:42:45,666 --> 01:42:47,501
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

1114
01:42:54,258 --> 01:42:56,218
This time, it's gonna take
more than killing me...

1115
01:42:56,301 --> 01:42:57,553
to kill me.

1116
01:43:05,894 --> 01:43:08,438
Murderer! Murderer!

1117
01:43:21,159 --> 01:43:22,911
I don't even wanna know.

1118
01:43:37,259 --> 01:43:38,260
No!

1119
01:43:38,427 --> 01:43:39,428
- No!
- No!

1120
01:43:39,595 --> 01:43:41,388
She's breaking free!

1121
01:43:41,555 --> 01:43:42,890
Hold her!

1122
01:43:43,056 --> 01:43:45,475
Strange, take America's power!

1123
01:43:51,315 --> 01:43:53,025
There's no other way.

1124
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:54,985
Yeah.

1125
01:43:55,319 --> 01:43:56,778
This is the only way.

1126
01:44:09,875 --> 01:44:12,503
It's me in Other Me's body.

1127
01:44:16,256 --> 01:44:19,259
You're here to take
my power, aren't you?

1128
01:44:20,260 --> 01:44:21,762
Before Wanda can.

1129
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:24,806
It's okay.

1130
01:44:25,766 --> 01:44:27,142
I understand now.

1131
01:44:31,939 --> 01:44:34,149
No, America.

1132
01:44:34,858 --> 01:44:37,319
I've come here to tell
you to trust yourself.

1133
01:44:37,486 --> 01:44:39,071
Trust your power.

1134
01:44:39,238 --> 01:44:41,240
That's how we stop her.

1135
01:44:41,907 --> 01:44:43,408
I can't control it. I...

1136
01:44:43,575 --> 01:44:45,577
Yes, you can.

1137
01:44:45,744 --> 01:44:47,204
You have been all along.

1138
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:52,668
Every time you opened a portal, you
sent us exactly where we needed to go.

1139
01:44:54,503 --> 01:44:56,129
What about the first time?

1140
01:44:56,296 --> 01:44:58,799
Even that led you
to this moment...

1141
01:45:00,759 --> 01:45:03,428
when you're gonna
kick that witch's ass.

1142
01:45:25,993 --> 01:45:27,077
I've got you.

1143
01:46:17,169 --> 01:46:18,545
I can't beat you.

1144
01:46:20,589 --> 01:46:22,090
So I'll give you what you want.

1145
01:46:36,396 --> 01:46:38,482
Billy. Tommy.

1146
01:46:38,899 --> 01:46:41,235
Mommy! It's the witch!

1147
01:46:41,401 --> 01:46:42,861
What have you done?

1148
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:44,112
- Mom!
- Mommy!

1149
01:46:44,279 --> 01:46:45,322
Wait! Boys!

1150
01:46:45,489 --> 01:46:46,907
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1151
01:46:47,074 --> 01:46:48,200
I'm your mother!

1152
01:46:50,619 --> 01:46:52,204
Get away from them.

1153
01:46:53,372 --> 01:46:54,790
Mom!

1154
01:46:55,249 --> 01:46:56,500
No.

1155
01:46:56,667 --> 01:46:57,667
Not yet.

1156
01:46:58,126 --> 01:46:59,336
Mommy!

1157
01:46:59,503 --> 01:47:00,671
Get away from our mom!

1158
01:47:00,838 --> 01:47:02,065
- You're not our real mom!
- Hey, boys. Stop.

1159
01:47:02,089 --> 01:47:03,966
- Please. Please.
- Get out of our house!

1160
01:47:04,132 --> 01:47:04,967
Boys, stop it.

1161
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:06,635
- You're not our mom!
- Get out!

1162
01:47:06,802 --> 01:47:07,886
- Go away!
- Go!

1163
01:47:08,053 --> 01:47:09,471
Stop it!

1164
01:47:17,729 --> 01:47:19,773
Please don't hurt us.

1165
01:47:20,148 --> 01:47:21,191
Please.

1166
01:47:22,150 --> 01:47:23,944
I would never hurt you.

1167
01:47:24,111 --> 01:47:25,112
Never.

1168
01:47:26,864 --> 01:47:29,074
I would never hurt anyone.

1169
01:47:29,241 --> 01:47:30,909
I'm not a monster.

1170
01:47:31,076 --> 01:47:32,369
I'm a...

1171
01:47:36,248 --> 01:47:37,291
I'm...

1172
01:47:45,424 --> 01:47:46,425
I'm sorry.

1173
01:47:54,433 --> 01:47:55,517
Mom!

1174
01:47:55,684 --> 01:47:57,311
- Are you okay?
- Hi.

1175
01:47:58,270 --> 01:47:59,605
Hi. Okay.

1176
01:47:59,771 --> 01:48:00,772
I'm okay.

1177
01:48:01,648 --> 01:48:04,276
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1178
01:48:15,996 --> 01:48:17,998
- Mom, don't go. Don't go.
- No, Mom. Don't.

1179
01:48:18,165 --> 01:48:19,165
- It's okay.
- Mom.

1180
01:48:19,291 --> 01:48:21,084
It's okay. It's okay.

1181
01:49:02,084 --> 01:49:04,294
Know that they'll be loved.

1182
01:49:45,294 --> 01:49:46,295
What now?

1183
01:49:46,461 --> 01:49:47,796
Get out of here.

1184
01:49:48,547 --> 01:49:49,590
I'll find you.

1185
01:49:58,515 --> 01:50:00,267
We have to go. Now!

1186
01:50:12,738 --> 01:50:14,573
I opened the Darkhold.

1187
01:50:15,407 --> 01:50:17,576
I have to close it.

1188
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:23,415
No one will ever be tempted
by the Darkhold again.

1189
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:09,503
You all right?

1190
01:51:10,170 --> 01:51:11,797
- Is it over?
- Yeah.

1191
01:51:12,422 --> 01:51:13,632
Is America okay?

1192
01:51:13,799 --> 01:51:15,759
She's on her way here to get us.

1193
01:51:18,220 --> 01:51:19,221
Wanda?

1194
01:51:21,014 --> 01:51:22,015
No.

1195
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:33,902
So she destroyed the
Darkhold in every universe.

1196
01:51:36,864 --> 01:51:38,448
She did the right thing.

1197
01:51:40,409 --> 01:51:41,410
Yeah, she did.

1198
01:51:49,376 --> 01:51:51,253
What's your universe like?

1199
01:51:53,297 --> 01:51:54,715
It's very beautiful.

1200
01:51:59,803 --> 01:52:01,471
I wish I could show you.

1201
01:52:05,559 --> 01:52:06,894
I'd really like that.

1202
01:52:11,982 --> 01:52:14,484
- But I have to go.
- Yeah.

1203
01:52:15,736 --> 01:52:16,987
Yeah, I know.

1204
01:52:20,741 --> 01:52:22,201
It's too bad, though.

1205
01:52:24,453 --> 01:52:26,413
Could've been one
hell of an Incursion.

1206
01:52:30,042 --> 01:52:31,251
I love you.

1207
01:52:34,338 --> 01:52:37,049
I love you in every universe.

1208
01:52:41,094 --> 01:52:44,389
It's not that I don't wanna care for
someone or have someone care for me.

1209
01:52:44,556 --> 01:52:45,766
It's just...

1210
01:52:49,102 --> 01:52:50,479
I get scared.

1211
01:52:50,646 --> 01:52:51,647
Yeah.

1212
01:52:54,733 --> 01:52:56,151
Yeah.

1213
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:08,497
Face your fears...

1214
01:53:11,250 --> 01:53:13,168
Doctor Strange.

1215
01:53:43,824 --> 01:53:46,910
How is this so much harder
than a Multiversal portal?

1216
01:53:49,079 --> 01:53:51,415
She needs to slow down
and be more patient.

1217
01:53:53,041 --> 01:53:55,127
Reminds me of another
student I knew.

1218
01:53:57,629 --> 01:53:58,964
How you feeling?

1219
01:53:59,590 --> 01:54:00,591
Why do you ask?

1220
01:54:02,467 --> 01:54:05,512
You used the Darkhold to
Dreamwalk into your own corpse.

1221
01:54:06,847 --> 01:54:08,182
Yeah, right, that.

1222
01:54:09,183 --> 01:54:10,184
Fine.

1223
01:54:12,519 --> 01:54:14,313
But I do wanna
ask you something.

1224
01:54:15,772 --> 01:54:17,232
Are you happy?

1225
01:54:18,650 --> 01:54:20,444
That's a...

1226
01:54:20,611 --> 01:54:21,737
interesting question.

1227
01:54:23,363 --> 01:54:26,116
You'd think that saving the
world would get you there...

1228
01:54:26,783 --> 01:54:27,993
but it doesn't.

1229
01:54:31,371 --> 01:54:35,459
Sometimes, I do wonder
about my other lives.

1230
01:54:36,835 --> 01:54:39,296
Yet I remain
grateful in this one.

1231
01:54:40,297 --> 01:54:42,090
Even with its tribulations.

1232
01:54:44,092 --> 01:54:46,762
At least we don't have to
go through it alone, huh?

1233
01:54:46,929 --> 01:54:48,013
No, we don't.

1234
01:55:00,150 --> 01:55:01,151
Wait.

1235
01:55:03,529 --> 01:55:04,571
'Sup?

1236
01:55:04,738 --> 01:55:05,739
'Sup.

1237
01:55:07,366 --> 01:55:08,367
Made some sparks.

1238
01:55:08,992 --> 01:55:09,993
Great.

1239
01:55:10,619 --> 01:55:14,289
Your parents would be proud. I hope
you'll get to show 'em one day.

1240
01:55:15,374 --> 01:55:16,416
Stephen.

1241
01:55:21,046 --> 01:55:23,340
I'm glad I fell
into your universe.

1242
01:55:25,300 --> 01:55:26,593
So am I, kid.

1243
01:55:28,262 --> 01:55:29,972
So am I.

1244
01:58:55,677 --> 01:58:57,012
Doctor Strange?

1245
01:59:00,432 --> 01:59:01,600
Can I help you?

1246
01:59:02,267 --> 01:59:03,727
You caused an Incursion...

1247
01:59:03,894 --> 01:59:05,521
and we're gonna fix it.

1248
01:59:14,238 --> 01:59:15,697
Unless you're afraid.

1249
01:59:20,577 --> 01:59:21,870
Not in the least.

1250
02:06:13,490 --> 02:06:14,700
It's over!

1250
02:06:15,305 --> 02:07:15,218
