2
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,544
Lucky ring on

3
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,860
I feel so much safer

4
00:01:44,895 --> 00:01:46,688
We're coming in hot

5
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:31,058
Hold on

6
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:44,396
Let's go

7
00:03:58,561 --> 00:03:59,503
What's the hold up?

8
00:04:00,038 --> 00:04:01,595
Nothing, we're on our way.

9
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:03,553
Let's go!

10
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:23,104
Your dude's trippin'

11
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,637
Stay on the wall, beware

12
00:05:25,174 --> 00:05:27,721
- Hey forget this maniac
- I'm not leaving him

13
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:32,623
Come

14
00:06:17,718 --> 00:06:20,981
You're just gonna rolled up on me huh?
After 8 damn years

15
00:06:22,071 --> 00:06:23,276
What's up with that?

16
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:26,901
You're in a black ops prison that
doesn't officially exist

17
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:29,678
I just got the location from a guy named Church

18
00:06:30,458 --> 00:06:31,797
An agency spook

19
00:06:31,832 --> 00:06:32,703
Excuse me?

20
00:06:33,582 --> 00:06:35,791
Agency's official relax

21
00:06:35,826 --> 00:06:37,521
Thank you for this, man.

22
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:39,742
What a waste of life

23
00:06:39,777 --> 00:06:41,972
You make 1 damn mistake

24
00:06:42,007 --> 00:06:43,465
It wasn't a mistake

25
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,705
It was stupid. You'd done that to me I would've
chopped you into pieces

26
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,184
You would've tried

27
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:50,121
Hey you want to thank the guys?

28
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:53,106
The guys?
Where our guys?

29
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,705
Hammer, Guzman..
- Gone

30
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,996
They'd gone?

31
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:59,583
Yeah

32
00:07:19,789 --> 00:07:21,396
Heard you killed more people than the plague

33
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:22,906
What about that?

34
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,832
The way they called you "Doctor Death"?

35
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:26,800
I've been in the medical field

36
00:07:28,706 --> 00:07:30,104
But that was a long time ago

37
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,455
So why'd you get locked away?

38
00:07:34,457 --> 00:07:36,104
Tax evasion

39
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:41,844
So you're all that's left of The Expendables

40
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,635
We're it

41
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,429
We started out with 5

42
00:07:45,464 --> 00:07:46,864
Built up to 22

43
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,869
I see Barney still hanging the tags up there

44
00:07:54,952 --> 00:07:57,584
See that jingling sounds the tags make

45
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:01,543
That's a reminder that our brothers are still here

46
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:05,280
Somewhere

47
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:07,566
Come on viking

48
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:11,555
Quit screwing with your blade

49
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:15,255
Or else you might find your tags up there

50
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,427
Jingling too

51
00:08:18,764 --> 00:08:21,811
Jingling...jingling jingling

52
00:08:27,404 --> 00:08:28,907
Sharpen it when you're done

53
00:08:45,194 --> 00:08:46,942
I think your friend is a little off

54
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:49,750
Come on Christmas, he's been in
a hole for over a year

55
00:08:49,785 --> 00:08:50,945
How'd he get so lucky

56
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:56,845
He tried pulling it off his half-assed political assassination
for a few bucks in this place called Swaziland

57
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,052
And he blew it

58
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,479
Self destructive

59
00:09:00,514 --> 00:09:02,563
Yes something like that.
But in all those years he's a good medic.

60
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:04,596
I would need to do a little checkup

61
00:09:04,731 --> 00:09:06,538
- Why are you so sarcastic?
- You're fake

62
00:09:07,073 --> 00:09:08,549
- Fake?
- Secrets, idiot.

63
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:12,132
I mean why do you take me off running around the
planet

64
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:15,188
To save this medical genius

65
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:16,413
As you describes

66
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:17,645
For what?

67
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,112
He's an Expendables

68
00:09:20,147 --> 00:09:20,747
Come on

69
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:22,082
He's an Expandables

70
00:09:22,117 --> 00:09:23,029
So he's 1 of the flock

71
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:24,190
Well let me tell you something

72
00:09:24,225 --> 00:09:26,371
When you're incarcerated for years

73
00:09:27,046 --> 00:09:28,701
I will come and save you

74
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,181
Thank you

75
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:32,402
But I doubt it

76
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,088
And I know you'd do the same for me

77
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:35,590
Truthfully?

78
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,124
You'd let me ride?

79
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,193
Exactly

80
00:09:42,155 --> 00:09:43,736
Hey Doc

81
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:47,386
What's your name?

82
00:09:47,421 --> 00:09:49,042
Christmas

83
00:09:49,077 --> 00:09:50,835
Is that real?

84
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,195
Authentic

85
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,855
Is that real too?

86
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:58,986
Oh no, I uh...spend 3 hours every morning
putting this up

87
00:09:59,995 --> 00:10:00,524
This is real

88
00:10:01,953 --> 00:10:02,536
Authentic

89
00:10:03,371 --> 00:10:04,533
Original

90
00:10:04,568 --> 00:10:05,591
Look at that

91
00:10:10,868 --> 00:10:12,168
Ballast is a little off

92
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,136
You uh, a knife man?

93
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:18,598
Best, ever

94
00:10:19,363 --> 00:10:20,984
I'm the knife before Christmas

95
00:10:21,019 --> 00:10:22,770
Ain't that right Barney

96
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:24,176
If you say so

97
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:27,164
Probably freestyling with a blade while you're
still sucking on your dad titties

98
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,133
Trying to learn how to eat with a spoon

99
00:10:29,168 --> 00:10:30,636
Yeah

100
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:33,484
You want to let us on a little secret you're
keeping

101
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:35,417
Stay out of my brain

102
00:10:35,452 --> 00:10:37,008
I'm gonna tell you
I can't wait to get home

103
00:10:37,043 --> 00:10:38,765
Eat some good food

104
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,057
Put on some fine threads

105
00:10:41,092 --> 00:10:43,099
Break up my 49' Pontiac

106
00:10:43,134 --> 00:10:45,915
Keep that baby until the engine blows up

107
00:10:47,469 --> 00:10:49,018
You didn't tell him did you?

108
00:10:49,053 --> 00:10:50,489
Tell me what?

109
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,642
We're not going home

110
00:10:57,019 --> 00:10:57,019
We're stopping at a dealer
The delivery of a shipment of bombs Altherometekih

111
00:10:57,054 --> 00:10:58,917
Ow, come on man

112
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:00,539
That shit is hellfire

113
00:11:00,574 --> 00:11:00,578
Hey we're changing stuff

114
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:03,569
You know why don't you just pick me up on your way back

115
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:04,545
We're a man short

116
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,557
Well, you know, I'd love to party with you boys

117
00:11:07,492 --> 00:11:10,501
But, uh, I don't have my shit

118
00:11:18,651 --> 00:11:19,563
That's my shit

119
00:11:19,598 --> 00:11:20,477
That is your shit

120
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:27,621
Doc, have you thank the guys,
helping you out?

121
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,587
Say something

122
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:39,683
Uh listen up

123
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,034
It's been a long time since I had a reason to say thank you

124
00:11:45,069 --> 00:11:47,539
So I just want

125
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:50,350
Oh you know I

126
00:11:50,385 --> 00:11:52,282
Just want to say

127
00:11:58,156 --> 00:11:58,965
Thank you

128
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,576
Sincerity is overwhelming

129
00:12:01,711 --> 00:12:02,770
I think him gonna weep

130
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:03,525
You know what? Enough

131
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:07,578
Do not be sarcastic

132
00:12:08,113 --> 00:12:10,537
That was great Doc

133
00:12:10,572 --> 00:12:12,222
You haven't got the time to talk for a long time

134
00:12:12,257 --> 00:12:13,590
You got the gift

135
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,950
It's like writing a book

136
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,568
Churchill is best

137
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:18,259
I think I made my point

138
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:21,676
I've moved you too

139
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:22,881
Stunning

140
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,766
Doc, great to have you back

141
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,346
No better place to be, yeah

142
00:13:04,837 --> 00:13:06,569
About time you boys showed up

143
00:13:10,595 --> 00:13:11,437
Nice boat

144
00:13:11,472 --> 00:13:12,956
Thanks ladies, but I looked myself

145
00:13:12,991 --> 00:13:16,054
Got 3 more just like him patrolling the hub

146
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:18,200
2 men ground teams every 400m

147
00:13:18,235 --> 00:13:19,638
Good work

148
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,675
Just cause you can fly a plane don't make you smarter than me

149
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,465
I'm sure it does

150
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:26,813
So you're the reason I've been stuck down here in this shithole

151
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:27,893
Shithole?

152
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:30,528
Brother you have no idea

153
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:32,550
Oh yeah, hahahaha

154
00:13:35,117 --> 00:13:36,076
What the hell is that?

155
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:38,215
This bitch will solve all your problem

156
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,907
Yeah, maybe for 10 seconds

157
00:13:39,942 --> 00:13:43,038
We're gonna blow this watch -
So now you got that problem too?

158
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:47,923
You walked into that 1

159
00:13:49,544 --> 00:13:50,713
Come on, look alive, look alive

160
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:01,547
It was all under control

161
00:15:02,282 --> 00:15:03,512
Yeah, that's what it looked like

162
00:15:09,035 --> 00:15:09,600
Where you've been?

163
00:15:09,635 --> 00:15:11,245
I had a doctors' appointment

164
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,072
Catch up with you boys later

165
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:17,382
What's he had?

166
00:15:28,873 --> 00:15:30,211
Watch your overhead

167
00:15:53,275 --> 00:15:54,775
Doc go

168
00:16:30,684 --> 00:16:32,475
Ooh sadly, the man attacked me with a knife

169
00:16:34,334 --> 00:16:34,920
He's good

170
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:35,975
Compared to you

171
00:16:41,073 --> 00:16:42,199
You do not want to see this

172
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:43,292
See what?

173
00:16:43,327 --> 00:16:44,350
I'll show you

174
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:18,428
Damn

175
00:17:18,463 --> 00:17:19,485
He's really good

176
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,284
Say it again and I'll shoot you

177
00:17:23,588 --> 00:17:24,554
Get in

178
00:17:40,706 --> 00:17:41,787
Where is the bomb?

179
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:43,053
It'll be here

180
00:17:45,269 --> 00:17:47,311
Barney looks like the target is right on its time

181
00:17:48,884 --> 00:17:50,497
There is a place in the second

182
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:54,469
Barney I'm gonna put you down

183
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,603
It can't be

184
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:13,619
What can't be?

185
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:15,124
We're gonna shoot this guy or what?

186
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:16,840
What's the hold up?

187
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,063
He's dead

188
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,348
Who's dead?

189
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,257
Stonebanks

190
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,858
Stonebanks

191
00:18:38,551 --> 00:18:40,067
Come on, get in

192
00:18:40,102 --> 00:18:42,186
Come on, move!
Go go go!

193
00:19:02,451 --> 00:19:03,290
Come

194
00:19:04,132 --> 00:19:05,535
Time to load her up

195
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:21,706
I told you

196
00:19:21,741 --> 00:19:22,688
10 seconds

197
00:19:30,219 --> 00:19:30,822
Hang on

198
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,013
Found you a ride

199
00:19:39,189 --> 00:19:40,212
Time to go

200
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:56,623
Come on, go go go!

201
00:20:02,777 --> 00:20:04,020
- How much we're getting pay for this?
- Not enough

202
00:20:20,228 --> 00:20:20,825
Go right

203
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,312
You're not gonna fit

204
00:20:51,347 --> 00:20:52,289
Always negative

205
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:05,583
I'm getting carsick

206
00:21:09,285 --> 00:21:10,448
Hang on Doc

207
00:21:25,366 --> 00:21:25,890
Get out

208
00:21:37,014 --> 00:21:37,813
Come on

209
00:21:48,748 --> 00:21:49,436
Caesar

210
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:50,845
We're coming your way, where are you?

211
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,305
In this filthy river, behind you

212
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:57,099
Try to stay as close as you can

213
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:03,592
Make room for Caeser

214
00:22:04,027 --> 00:22:06,502
Move your ass in

215
00:22:10,637 --> 00:22:11,367
Who's it?

216
00:22:11,402 --> 00:22:13,197
I think it's my guy on boat

217
00:22:19,517 --> 00:22:20,673
---

218
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:28,151
Hold it, hold it, you got it going

219
00:22:34,517 --> 00:22:35,888
- You alright?
- Yeah

220
00:22:42,224 --> 00:22:43,239
Turn over

221
00:23:28,403 --> 00:23:30,549
Incoming!

222
00:23:31,804 --> 00:23:32,783
Move!

223
00:23:32,818 --> 00:23:33,981
Move!

224
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:35,518
We got you man, come on!

225
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:12,497
Maybe this will bring you luck

226
00:26:40,787 --> 00:26:41,816
Is he gonna make it?

227
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,153
I don't know

228
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:44,027
Who did this?

229
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,430
Stonebanks

230
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,032
I thought you killed him

231
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,974
So do I

232
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,973
He shot Caeser to get back in me

233
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:57,535
Yeah I'm getting out of this business

234
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:59,399
And so should you

235
00:27:02,105 --> 00:27:02,544
Not yet

236
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:06,583
If you need any help with
Stonebanks

237
00:27:26,975 --> 00:27:28,908
It's supposed to be the guy named Church

238
00:27:28,943 --> 00:27:30,063
I know who you are

239
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:31,645
So who are you?

240
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,792
Operations officer Drummer

241
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,452
You don't have to worry about Church anymore

242
00:27:38,508 --> 00:27:41,425
He's um, he's out of the picture

243
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:44,841
Jesus Ross

244
00:27:44,876 --> 00:27:46,575
What a mess

245
00:27:47,771 --> 00:27:48,871
We gave you everything

246
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:52,953
Target opportunity, all the intel you could asked for

247
00:27:52,988 --> 00:27:56,687
And you got decimated

248
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:59,331
And my target went away

249
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:00,588
Am I wrong huh?

250
00:28:01,023 --> 00:28:02,073
Am I missing something?

251
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:06,545
Yes, sure you said the target name was Victim

252
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,552
- And?
- It was wrong

253
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:11,067
His real name was Conrad Stonebanks

254
00:28:13,247 --> 00:28:16,372
We knew him only as Victor Maines

255
00:28:17,214 --> 00:28:22,066
Arms dealer, made billions selling to every psycho warlord in Africa and the Middle East

256
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:26,006
His own mercenary army is personally responsible

257
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:29,733
For the torture and killing

258
00:28:29,768 --> 00:28:32,253
2 of the best men I ever knew friend

259
00:28:33,339 --> 00:28:35,305
I don't give a shit what his name is

260
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,929
I don't like him

261
00:28:37,984 --> 00:28:39,714
I want him as bad as you do

262
00:28:40,981 --> 00:28:43,367
This happened on my watch

263
00:28:43,402 --> 00:28:48,324
You fucked up, and I'm wearing it

264
00:28:51,774 --> 00:28:53,111
I'll find him

265
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:54,122
Again

266
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:56,470
You have 1 more shot

267
00:28:59,848 --> 00:29:01,574
Nice to finally meet you Barney

268
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:10,325
Your man are shot to shit, what are
you gonna do for a team

269
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,477
Don't worry about it
I'll handle it

270
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:17,302
Relax

271
00:29:18,632 --> 00:29:20,777
You're gonna give yourself a stroke

272
00:29:22,445 --> 00:29:24,766
What's with these guys

273
00:29:24,801 --> 00:29:26,134
Do you mind?

274
00:29:59,864 --> 00:30:03,575
Do you think when the artist painted this, he ever thought
it would go for such a ridiculous price?

275
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:09,690
I mean what is this? Just some paint, brushes, some shape,
canvas, what's the big deal?

276
00:30:14,611 --> 00:30:15,911
It's shit

277
00:30:15,946 --> 00:30:16,998
What do you want for it?

278
00:30:17,033 --> 00:30:18,331
3 million

279
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:20,222
Done

280
00:30:29,271 --> 00:30:30,051
You know

281
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:32,871
It's very hard for me to say this

282
00:30:32,906 --> 00:30:35,613
But at 1 time, you guys were the best

283
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:37,995
Maybe still are

284
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:41,654
But nothing lasts forever

285
00:30:45,649 --> 00:30:48,044
Hard as it is to hear

286
00:30:51,252 --> 00:30:53,077
We're not the future anymore

287
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,773
Unfortunately for us

288
00:30:54,808 --> 00:30:56,526
We're part of the past

289
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:06,537
As I see it

290
00:31:07,472 --> 00:31:08,542
If we keep this life up

291
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,842
The only this thing ends

292
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,791
Or all of this

293
00:31:18,885 --> 00:31:21,651
Is in a hole in the ground and no 1 giving a shit

294
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:27,894
Now, if that's the way I'm suppossed to go out,
I can live with that

295
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:31,259
For me

296
00:31:33,837 --> 00:31:35,552
But what I can't live with

297
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:38,364
And I won't live with

298
00:31:41,001 --> 00:31:42,971
Is taking you with me

299
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:45,118
What are you saying?
That's our call

300
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,400
I'm changing things now

301
00:31:49,756 --> 00:31:51,302
You

302
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:53,094
Me

303
00:31:54,442 --> 00:31:56,091
All of us

304
00:31:59,746 --> 00:32:00,519
It's over

305
00:32:00,654 --> 00:32:02,576
We're done

306
00:32:03,111 --> 00:32:05,543
Done? You ripped me out

307
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:06,695
Cut me loose

308
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,563
You'll survive

309
00:32:08,798 --> 00:32:10,069
You all will

310
00:32:13,028 --> 00:32:14,894
You live your lives while you can

311
00:32:19,808 --> 00:32:20,871
Where are you going, Barney?

312
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:34,993
Hey you think you just pulled the plug and that's it?

313
00:32:35,028 --> 00:32:36,571
- Just did.
- Yeah?

314
00:32:36,606 --> 00:32:38,047
Well it doesn't work that way

315
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:39,356
What?

316
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,830
We've been through the mud

317
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:42,340
We shit in the blood

318
00:32:42,375 --> 00:32:44,526
And I've saved your arse more times than I can count

319
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:49,967
You don't want me to shot this this guy that took Caeser down?

320
00:32:52,106 --> 00:32:53,631
We're not doing that

321
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:00,947
You know when I joined

322
00:33:03,374 --> 00:33:04,599
I joined for the whole ride

323
00:33:06,709 --> 00:33:07,596
I know you did

324
00:33:10,414 --> 00:33:11,570
Rides over

325
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,275
Bonaparte

326
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:35,921
Sorry to hear about Caeser

327
00:34:35,956 --> 00:34:38,571
I hope you pulls through with the good ones

328
00:34:38,606 --> 00:34:39,342
Yeah

329
00:34:39,377 --> 00:34:41,307
Well here we are again

330
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:42,216
What do you need?

331
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,445
New Team

332
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,412
Retired the old ones

333
00:34:45,447 --> 00:34:47,454
Welcome to the 21st century

334
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,027
Any guys you looking for?

335
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:53,331
Young, hungry to take a bullet

336
00:34:53,366 --> 00:34:55,541
We're going after Stonebanks

337
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:56,179
Stonebanks

338
00:34:57,270 --> 00:35:00,548
Let's see, I'm not the only one sleeping.
Stonebanks is dead my friend

339
00:35:01,383 --> 00:35:02,089
No, he's not

340
00:35:05,192 --> 00:35:05,537
That is not good

341
00:35:07,306 --> 00:35:08,572
If it was half of what it used to be, 5 or 4 ain't gonna cut it

342
00:35:09,407 --> 00:35:10,819
You're gonna need 50

343
00:35:10,854 --> 00:35:12,047
We gotta move fast, no time

344
00:35:12,082 --> 00:35:14,467
If I go to do it fast then I can't guarantee the best

345
00:35:14,502 --> 00:35:16,080
Just give me something, don't give it to him

346
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:17,523
What?

347
00:35:17,558 --> 00:35:18,575
Was it a 1 way ticket?

348
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:20,262
Could be

349
00:35:20,297 --> 00:35:22,617
Fine

350
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:24,825
I got in line with a few head cases

351
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,588
Couple of these guys are crying up to shoot themselves

352
00:35:28,818 --> 00:35:29,420
Wait

353
00:35:29,455 --> 00:35:31,847
What about these guys?
They're anything?

354
00:35:31,882 --> 00:35:32,718
These guys are pussies

355
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:42,555
Foreign, expert hacker

356
00:35:42,590 --> 00:35:43,853
Commander pilot

357
00:35:43,888 --> 00:35:46,516
Did 18 month for hacking in Seattle central operating systems

358
00:35:46,608 --> 00:35:48,545
Shut down the whole city for 3 days

359
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,022
Why the hell would he do that?

360
00:35:50,057 --> 00:35:51,284
Because he can

361
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:54,341
What?

362
00:35:55,565 --> 00:35:57,392
I'm not looking for an office worker

363
00:35:57,427 --> 00:35:58,712
Oh that's not him

364
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:09,732
Another 1 with a death wish.
You 2 got a lot in common.

365
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,483
I can't do that

366
00:36:21,853 --> 00:36:22,653
You know what?

367
00:36:22,688 --> 00:36:23,882
I'm gonna come around and I'll say it

368
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:25,670
I belong on you

369
00:36:36,807 --> 00:36:38,877
- You can't do that.
- No.

370
00:36:38,912 --> 00:36:40,879
He was special on that 1

371
00:36:40,914 --> 00:36:43,438
Yeah, yeah, that's the p-----

372
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:49,728
Always on the damn road going someplace you don't give a damn about

373
00:36:49,763 --> 00:36:51,027
Beat standing still

374
00:36:51,062 --> 00:36:52,284
Yeah I got 2 ex-wives

375
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:54,392
- and 3 kids I've lost my numbers with disagree

376
00:36:59,981 --> 00:37:02,514
- Hey did you turned off the autopilot?
- I didn't touch the autopilot.

377
00:37:02,949 --> 00:37:04,000
Read this

378
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:05,531
Are we off course?

379
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,641
Where the hell are we?
Hang on for a second

380
00:37:10,587 --> 00:37:12,568
Is that the Big Dipper?

381
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:13,931
Yeah we gotta turn around

382
00:37:16,345 --> 00:37:20,203
Next candidate is an expert in field craft and close quarters combat

383
00:37:22,478 --> 00:37:23,258
Luna

384
00:37:23,293 --> 00:37:24,254
Hi

385
00:37:24,289 --> 00:37:27,209
Young lady, meet a friend of mine. Barney Ross.
Barney Ross, Luna. Luna, Barney Ross.

386
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:29,457
Nice to meet you Mr. Ross

387
00:37:29,492 --> 00:37:31,789
Gentlemen if you'd follow me

388
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:33,606
Come on

389
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:35,503
So Luna how are things?

390
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:37,270
The same thing

391
00:37:37,305 --> 00:37:39,259
What do you do?

392
00:37:40,946 --> 00:37:42,774
Forget this

393
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:45,572
All right so what are we doing here?

394
00:37:45,607 --> 00:37:46,597
Have a drink

395
00:37:47,407 --> 00:37:48,569
Where's your candidate?

396
00:37:48,604 --> 00:37:52,008
Right there in the red dress about to chop those guys in half

397
00:37:56,046 --> 00:37:58,544
- The hostess?
- Not the hostess

398
00:37:58,579 --> 00:37:59,586
She's the bouncer

399
00:38:20,948 --> 00:38:22,031
I can't do that

400
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:23,542
You want to slip on a dress and give it a shot

401
00:38:27,612 --> 00:38:28,483
Men

402
00:38:32,404 --> 00:38:33,459
She's good

403
00:38:33,494 --> 00:38:35,531
You wanna see her without heels

404
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:45,155
When did you last checkup?

405
00:38:45,437 --> 00:38:46,992
I don't know, a while back

406
00:38:47,027 --> 00:38:49,100
Our cholesterol ---

407
00:38:49,135 --> 00:38:50,083
Yeah pretty much

408
00:38:50,118 --> 00:38:51,418
Except with me

409
00:38:53,427 --> 00:38:54,687
I've found a lump in my lung

410
00:38:56,553 --> 00:38:58,026
Buried dark they said

411
00:38:58,061 --> 00:39:00,563
Why shouldn't I see that coming?

412
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:05,553
Well, what do you do?

413
00:39:05,688 --> 00:39:08,544
I try to make as much money as I can,
fast as I can.

414
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:11,247
For those kids you know
The 1 you don't talk to

415
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:13,607
Make some kind of a good impression on them, before I'm gone

416
00:39:16,457 --> 00:39:17,829
Sad isn't it?

417
00:39:17,864 --> 00:39:19,805
Yeah it is sad. I'm sorry.

418
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,844
Nah that's all bullshit, I'm fine

419
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:23,948
Just checking you're still human

420
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:30,979
Had you going there now didn't you?

421
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:32,455
Yeah you did goddammit

422
00:39:32,490 --> 00:39:34,916
That can never happen again
I'll never trust you again

423
00:39:34,951 --> 00:39:37,067
Next kid has a bit of a dark force

424
00:39:37,102 --> 00:39:41,050
Just came across my desk. I don't like throwing in a wildcard.

425
00:39:41,085 --> 00:39:43,551
But this guy is too much to just passed up

426
00:39:45,099 --> 00:39:46,506
Anybody see Felipe

427
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:51,041
Yo Felipe

428
00:39:58,422 --> 00:39:59,581
This gotta be good Bonaparte

429
00:40:00,627 --> 00:40:01,541
Yeah I bet

430
00:40:01,576 --> 00:40:03,552
Finally got it right

431
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:10,799
Damn

432
00:40:16,702 --> 00:40:17,362
(In advance)

433
00:40:17,397 --> 00:40:18,723
Meet Barney Ross

434
00:40:22,866 --> 00:40:24,975
Galgo, you sent me another fake resume

435
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,981
Mr. Ross I can do what you need, whatever you need

436
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:31,265
I am healthier than I look, stronger than I look

437
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,566
Faster than I look

438
00:40:32,601 --> 00:40:35,450
Actually, shit, you were born in 1984

439
00:40:35,485 --> 00:40:36,539
Of course not

440
00:40:36,574 --> 00:40:38,574
But I feel like that I was born in 1984

441
00:40:38,609 --> 00:40:40,405
Do not waste your time, Barney we leave

442
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,994
Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross, Mr. Ross

443
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:43,622
Please

444
00:40:43,657 --> 00:40:47,735
It's like uh, it's like I have this uh, called the fountain of youth

445
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,975
I mean, not the fountain of youth

446
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,075
Ponce de Leon

447
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,341
Um by the way

448
00:40:54,376 --> 00:40:57,723
I know a little Spanish

449
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:59,961
Mr. Ross

450
00:40:59,996 --> 00:41:03,571
Age is just a state of mind

451
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:07,597
You're only old, when you surrender

452
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:10,772
When you give up, and I haven't, not yet

453
00:41:10,807 --> 00:41:12,455
- Galgo, this shit has got to stop
- I gotta go

454
00:41:12,490 --> 00:41:13,926
This is the third time this month

455
00:41:13,961 --> 00:41:15,755
Seriously, moved on

456
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,580
What's this guy story?

457
00:41:17,615 --> 00:41:19,131
Actually I feel a little sorry for him

458
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,431
His last team dropped him

459
00:41:20,466 --> 00:41:22,819
Back in the day, you couldn't catch him

460
00:41:22,854 --> 00:41:25,710
- Very fast, maybe even faster than you
- No way

461
00:41:25,745 --> 00:41:26,595
Oh maybe

462
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:28,175
But, what am I gonna say

463
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,683
It's a young man's game

464
00:41:31,645 --> 00:41:33,082
I need a job!

465
00:41:33,117 --> 00:41:39,239
All I know what to do is killing people
And I do that very well

466
00:41:39,274 --> 00:41:42,015
Damn

467
00:41:49,635 --> 00:41:54,429
- What's the story on this guy?
- Found him in DARPA

468
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:56,644
- DARPA?
- Sounds like a town in North Africa

469
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,486
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency

470
00:41:59,521 --> 00:42:02,589
Now that's where the brightest military minds develop next-gen weapons

471
00:42:02,724 --> 00:42:04,563
Google it

472
00:42:04,798 --> 00:42:06,555
I'm not looking for weapons nerd

473
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,558
Ah, then you've come to the right place

474
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:15,061
Yo Marlito

475
00:42:23,462 --> 00:42:25,051
Mars I like you to meet Barney Ross

476
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:27,584
Now truth is, Mars is as gifted as they get

477
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:28,746
Whatever you say

478
00:42:29,621 --> 00:42:30,463
What do you say?

479
00:42:30,498 --> 00:42:33,301
What I've got here is an X-25 assault rifle

480
00:42:33,336 --> 00:42:36,185
Laser range, 25mm high explosive burst rounds

481
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,721
Can be programmed to detonate over or behind the target

482
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:49,689
He'll do

483
00:42:53,294 --> 00:42:57,481
Final candidate, John Smilee.
Guy's got the most in the industry.

484
00:42:57,516 --> 00:43:00,595
A lot of skills, Marines, special operator

485
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:02,542
- But there is, an issue
- What issue?

486
00:43:03,277 --> 00:43:06,545
Yeah classic authority problem

487
00:43:09,002 --> 00:43:11,074
There's a couple more swimming around in there too

488
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:45,018
Sorry Barney for wasting your time like this.
He's not the guy I thought he was.

489
00:43:45,053 --> 00:43:46,270
No

490
00:43:46,305 --> 00:43:47,302
I want to meet him

491
00:43:55,834 --> 00:43:56,577
John

492
00:43:56,612 --> 00:43:58,507
Meet Barney Ross

493
00:44:00,365 --> 00:44:02,557
Didn't do much to impress out there today didn't you?

494
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:05,578
You called me, I didn't call you

495
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,517
Think you'd die for the money?

496
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:11,659
Maybe you like getting your ass kicked in front of strangers

497
00:44:21,747 --> 00:44:23,197
What do you guys want from me?

498
00:44:24,625 --> 00:44:25,854
You running from something?

499
00:44:26,832 --> 00:44:28,309
I don't know you

500
00:44:28,344 --> 00:44:29,517
But I know you

501
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:30,503
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah

502
00:44:30,538 --> 00:44:31,237
How's that

503
00:44:31,272 --> 00:44:34,653
Maybe he thinks you got potential and we're short on time.
That's about right?

504
00:44:34,688 --> 00:44:36,057
That's about it

505
00:44:36,092 --> 00:44:37,509
What's your problem?

506
00:44:37,544 --> 00:44:41,130
Your problem is you're rolling around the dirt for chump change

507
00:44:42,465 --> 00:44:44,853
I hear you lost a few friends in the desert

508
00:44:44,888 --> 00:44:47,099
They bought it, and you didn't

509
00:44:47,134 --> 00:44:48,223
And you wear the guilt

510
00:44:49,271 --> 00:44:50,577
I've been there

511
00:44:50,612 --> 00:44:52,162
He's been there

512
00:44:52,197 --> 00:44:54,021
We all lived it

513
00:44:55,249 --> 00:44:57,251
Well you don't know me

514
00:44:57,286 --> 00:44:58,957
I know the type

515
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,784
Bonaparte you're right

516
00:45:11,935 --> 00:45:12,956
He did waste my time

517
00:45:25,299 --> 00:45:26,432
Hey, you didn't waste your time

518
00:45:43,262 --> 00:45:46,430
If we're going after Stonebanks,
we might want to talk about financials now

519
00:45:46,465 --> 00:45:48,760
Normally it's just 10%, but

520
00:45:48,795 --> 00:45:55,300
I figured with Stonebanks in the equation I might want to get my fee possibly now

521
00:45:57,014 --> 00:46:00,279
I mean, not that you're not good for it,
just, if you don't mind

522
00:46:00,314 --> 00:46:01,579
I don't mind

523
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:04,524
It sounds like you don't have too much faith in me

524
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:06,965
I don't

525
00:46:35,681 --> 00:46:37,294
How was your occassion?

526
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:38,780
Ready to go to work?

527
00:46:38,815 --> 00:46:40,184
You find them yet?

528
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:43,694
He's in Bucharest putting together a deal with some Albanian mobster

529
00:46:43,729 --> 00:46:46,287
And get 36 hours, that's your window

530
00:46:46,676 --> 00:46:48,362
After that he's back off the gird

531
00:46:48,397 --> 00:46:50,427
Satellite map

532
00:46:50,462 --> 00:46:52,639
Coordinates for where he'll be

533
00:46:54,287 --> 00:46:55,728
Interesting guy

534
00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:58,432
Your friend Stonebanks

535
00:46:58,467 --> 00:46:59,590
You're not gonna like this but

536
00:47:00,325 --> 00:47:01,566
They want him alive

537
00:47:01,801 --> 00:47:03,535
Are you kidding me?

538
00:47:03,770 --> 00:47:05,540
They want to try him at Hague

539
00:47:07,613 --> 00:47:08,568
For war crimes

540
00:47:08,803 --> 00:47:11,996
You're gonna give this guy a chance in court?

541
00:47:12,031 --> 00:47:12,876
It's not my decision

542
00:47:15,409 --> 00:47:18,547
- Now never is
- That's the way it's gotta be

543
00:47:19,916 --> 00:47:23,425
Agency's got a local safehouse

544
00:47:24,516 --> 00:47:25,906
You're gonna need it

545
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,598
Don't trash the place

546
00:48:14,394 --> 00:48:15,298
I heard you got a job

547
00:48:15,333 --> 00:48:16,386
That's right

548
00:48:17,549 --> 00:48:19,033
Who the hell are they?

549
00:48:19,068 --> 00:48:20,363
They're with me

550
00:48:23,453 --> 00:48:24,756
And we're not?

551
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,885
Gunner I had told you everything I had to tell you back in the bar

552
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:28,940
Stop drinking so much

553
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,163
You want to get yourself killed

554
00:48:32,198 --> 00:48:33,859
With those youngsters

555
00:48:36,103 --> 00:48:37,864
Do us all a favor and get the hell out of here

556
00:48:41,211 --> 00:48:42,371
Wheels up in 10

557
00:48:53,337 --> 00:48:54,880
If your guys wanted to fight,

558
00:48:54,915 --> 00:48:56,532
why didn't they just get married?

559
00:48:57,066 --> 00:49:00,103
You seriously somking next to aviation fuel?

560
00:49:07,625 --> 00:49:08,586
Amateur

561
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:11,271
Amateur assholes

562
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,158
Balugd calls from my grandfather?

563
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:16,761
Grandpa's about to crash your windpipe

564
00:49:19,363 --> 00:49:21,147
What is this? It's your toy?

565
00:49:21,182 --> 00:49:22,730
Boy?

566
00:49:22,765 --> 00:49:24,910
You want to dance big guy?

567
00:49:27,023 --> 00:49:28,637
Hey! It's just a job

568
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:32,639
Come on, let's go

569
00:49:33,803 --> 00:49:35,837
Bunch of has been's still trying to be hard

570
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,235
You're young and you're dumb

571
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,823
Jingling jingling

572
00:49:51,999 --> 00:49:52,844
Keep it

573
00:49:54,254 --> 00:49:55,309
You're gonna need it

574
00:50:05,947 --> 00:50:07,555
Never thought you'll be calling that favor

575
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:10,039
I'm also not happy about it

576
00:50:46,717 --> 00:50:47,771
Got a minute?

577
00:50:51,057 --> 00:50:52,120
What do you need?

578
00:50:52,155 --> 00:50:54,826
Tell me more about this gut we're going after

579
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:57,590
It doesn't matter you're hired to do a job

580
00:50:59,980 --> 00:51:01,551
What about answering why we're doing this job?

581
00:51:06,488 --> 00:51:08,503
I owe you a salary that's it

582
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:13,811
Why are we going after Stonebanks?

583
00:51:13,846 --> 00:51:16,493
You have a hard time taking orders don't you?

584
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:18,327
If I don't know what they are, yeah

585
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:24,482
I know you don't give a damn about us

586
00:51:24,517 --> 00:51:25,857
I get that

587
00:51:26,389 --> 00:51:30,359
But just tell me why you want to take out this guy so bad

588
00:53:30,186 --> 00:53:31,656
30s to drop

589
00:53:31,691 --> 00:53:32,824
Copy that

590
00:53:34,227 --> 00:53:34,579
Let's go

591
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:41,314
I can take care of myself

592
00:53:41,349 --> 00:53:43,218
20s to drop

593
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:49,970
10s

594
00:54:49,485 --> 00:54:50,854
We're on

595
00:55:01,618 --> 00:55:03,269
This guy got more muscle than a cartel king

596
00:55:03,304 --> 00:55:04,593
Maybe he's up for a competition or something

597
00:55:05,028 --> 00:55:06,526
What you're drinking Barney?
Is that like vanilla latte or somehting?

598
00:55:07,061 --> 00:55:07,516
Stay sharp

599
00:55:08,983 --> 00:55:09,716
Moved

600
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:12,497
You have to think about this again Mr.

601
00:55:12,532 --> 00:55:14,786
I promise you this won't happen again

602
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:16,124
Move the cart

603
00:55:38,173 --> 00:55:39,396
Nice driving Mars

604
00:55:39,431 --> 00:55:40,660
Good performance

605
00:55:40,695 --> 00:55:42,214
Yeah, too good

606
00:55:42,249 --> 00:55:43,876
Any closer and I'd beat his ass

607
00:55:43,911 --> 00:55:44,939
I believe her

608
00:55:44,974 --> 00:55:46,025
Got 'em

609
00:55:54,891 --> 00:55:56,851
Oh man, this guy's protected better than the president

610
00:55:56,886 --> 00:55:58,712
Yeah, it's like a 5-star fortress

611
00:55:58,747 --> 00:55:59,534
Listen we're not gonna taking him there

612
00:56:00,369 --> 00:56:02,561
I bet the hotel is full of guests

613
00:56:02,796 --> 00:56:03,512
So where do we hit them?

614
00:56:03,847 --> 00:56:04,507
At the meet

615
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:06,549
We'll hit them on all 4 sides

616
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:08,483
Hit him hard

617
00:56:09,785 --> 00:56:10,630
Ok, um, so

618
00:56:10,665 --> 00:56:15,469
Our plan is to what? Kick down the door and start spraying bullet?

619
00:56:15,504 --> 00:56:16,484
It's a great plan

620
00:56:16,519 --> 00:56:17,781
If it's 1985

621
00:56:17,816 --> 00:56:19,042
And what's that supposed to mean?

622
00:56:20,456 --> 00:56:21,329
You heard me

623
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:27,029
You got a better plan?

624
00:56:27,064 --> 00:56:28,013
Much better

625
00:56:28,048 --> 00:56:29,252
Let's hear it

626
00:56:29,287 --> 00:56:30,971
Thorn, you're up

627
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:33,831
Ok, I'm the plan

628
00:56:36,573 --> 00:56:37,455
This better be good

629
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,353
First I hacked the security grid main server, boom

630
00:56:39,388 --> 00:56:42,515
Bypassed the motion detector laser and biometric sensors, pow

631
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,481
Override the surveillance videos and CCTV systems, ba-bam

632
00:56:46,516 --> 00:56:48,130
An we are in

633
00:56:49,756 --> 00:56:51,506
It's child play

634
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:53,519
Just like that?

635
00:56:53,554 --> 00:56:54,578
Just like that

636
00:56:54,613 --> 00:56:56,165
Just like that

637
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:58,228
Exactly, like that

638
00:57:04,417 --> 00:57:04,598
You better be right

639
00:57:08,928 --> 00:57:09,703
Let's go

640
00:57:38,264 --> 00:57:39,489
So why'd you let your team go?

641
00:57:42,511 --> 00:57:45,397
It was time

642
00:57:45,432 --> 00:57:47,647
They didn't seem to happy about it

643
00:57:48,521 --> 00:57:51,054
If you're looking to go the family route,

644
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,418
it's the wrong job for you

645
00:57:55,453 --> 00:57:58,622
There are different kinds of family

646
00:58:00,586 --> 00:58:02,060
And when my life is on the line

647
00:58:03,075 --> 00:58:04,598
That's my family fighting with me

648
00:58:12,013 --> 00:58:12,996
You know what I mean

649
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,421
Yeah, I know what you mean

650
00:58:31,313 --> 00:58:32,763
Right on time

651
00:58:37,121 --> 00:58:38,216
Ladies First

652
00:58:38,251 --> 00:58:39,627
Go ahead the Thorn

653
00:58:39,662 --> 00:58:40,807
Will you shut up and get in this sewer

654
00:59:54,300 --> 00:59:57,710
And ladies and gentlemen, we officially have eyes in the skies

655
00:59:57,745 --> 00:59:58,720
Copy that

656
00:59:58,755 --> 00:59:59,527
Let's do this

657
01:00:00,162 --> 01:00:00,568
Thought you'd never ask

658
01:00:42,492 --> 01:00:43,013
Good to go

659
01:00:45,538 --> 01:00:45,994
Good luck boys

660
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:07,593
Heck

661
01:01:08,128 --> 01:01:08,868
What's the problem?

662
01:01:08,903 --> 01:01:10,759
The buyer, they're early

663
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:12,316
Threat just doubled

664
01:01:27,729 --> 01:01:28,713
You're early

665
01:01:30,089 --> 01:01:31,954
What do you think?

666
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,122
It's ok

667
01:01:45,074 --> 01:01:46,461
When Cain's the little brother

668
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:49,697
God banish him from civilization

669
01:01:49,732 --> 01:01:52,189
But before that he placed a mark on him

670
01:01:53,907 --> 01:01:55,542

01:01:56,593 --> 01:01:59,019
It protect him from roving hunters

672
01:02:01,655 --> 01:02:02,596
This is not X-ray artwork

673
01:02:04,156 --> 01:02:04,548
Only oils

674
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:06,080
Very good

675
01:02:09,104 --> 01:02:10,224
There you have it

676
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,490
Gabil

677
01:02:12,621 --> 01:02:13,154
My pleasure

678
01:02:13,189 --> 01:02:13,924
As always

679
01:02:16,656 --> 01:02:21,052
Can you access nuclear weapons?

680
01:02:26,115 --> 01:02:26,959
I might

681
01:02:27,842 --> 01:02:31,360
But generally I find people a little too emotional for ownership

682
01:02:32,594 --> 01:02:35,125
And I'd hate you killing all my other customers by accident

683
01:02:35,823 --> 01:02:36,983
Or on purpose

684
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:40,511
In position

685
01:02:42,811 --> 01:02:43,903
In position

686
01:02:44,569 --> 01:02:45,451
Set

687
01:02:45,486 --> 01:02:46,891
I'll pay you what you want

688
01:02:48,178 --> 01:02:49,022
Let me think about it

689
01:02:52,399 --> 01:02:53,354
We're on

690
01:03:09,875 --> 01:03:11,314
Stonebanks is moving, watch it

691
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:17,572
I will do this

692
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:25,189
Try again

693
01:03:26,739 --> 01:03:28,603
Open Sesame

694
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:32,082
Go go go

695
01:03:34,014 --> 01:03:35,467
Move

696
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:47,219
Go

697
01:03:51,601 --> 01:03:52,873
Barney Ross says hello

698
01:04:00,943 --> 01:04:02,034
Nice job

699
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:05,536
Trench you copy?

700
01:04:07,868 --> 01:04:08,573
I'm waiting

701
01:04:09,308 --> 01:04:10,860
Got it secured

702
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:12,343
I'll hurry up

703
01:04:12,378 --> 01:04:13,291
It's boring

704
01:04:22,860 --> 01:04:25,061
Why don't you just a bullet in his head and be done with it

705
01:04:36,349 --> 01:04:37,401
Hey you said we're just taking them out

706
01:04:40,847 --> 01:04:41,585
Good morning

707
01:04:46,755 --> 01:04:48,684
These are your students?

708
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:50,952
Hey kids what you learnt tonight huh?

709
01:04:52,081 --> 01:04:53,637
What happened to the old crew?

710
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:55,533
Oh that's right

711
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:59,572
They stuck their noses into other people's world and got fatally injured

712
01:05:00,107 --> 01:05:02,499
Now they're The Deletables

713
01:05:02,534 --> 01:05:04,567
Hey you hear that kids?

714
01:05:04,602 --> 01:05:06,577
Take note cause that what you're doing right now

715
01:05:07,312 --> 01:05:08,569
Let me show him

716
01:05:08,904 --> 01:05:12,363
You're talking pretty tough your guys incapacitated which is good for you

717
01:05:12,398 --> 01:05:16,504
Why don't you cut me loose and I'll open your meat shirt and show you your own heart

718
01:05:18,618 --> 01:05:19,996
Hey Barney

719
01:05:21,575 --> 01:05:24,141
Why don't the 2 of us just end this? What do you say?

720
01:05:24,176 --> 01:05:28,609
Mix it up, either you snapping my spine or me snapping yours

721
01:05:28,644 --> 01:05:30,507
You know, make it snappy

722
01:05:32,163 --> 01:05:33,884
He thinks I'm joking.
I'm not joking.

723
01:05:33,919 --> 01:05:35,461
You should see me when I'm angry

724
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:37,067
You'd be very impressed

725
01:05:37,102 --> 01:05:38,661
And very dead

726
01:05:40,661 --> 01:05:41,327
So come on pal

727
01:05:41,362 --> 01:05:44,126
Anything you want to get off your chest

728
01:05:46,405 --> 01:05:47,303
Come on, lay it out

729
01:05:47,338 --> 01:05:48,812
I'm a good listener

730
01:05:51,692 --> 01:05:53,834
You're gonna take me back to the has been crew?

731
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:55,481
Carved me up around the fire

732
01:05:55,516 --> 01:05:57,135
Very tribal

733
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:04,584
When we stop, I wanna break every bone on your body

734
01:06:05,019 --> 01:06:07,527
And drop what's left at The Hague

735
01:06:08,362 --> 01:06:13,396
The Hague

736
01:06:13,431 --> 01:06:15,299
I'm a war criminal

737
01:06:15,334 --> 01:06:16,382
Keep laughing

738
01:06:18,526 --> 01:06:20,325
Do you think,

739
01:06:20,360 --> 01:06:23,559
that you could just deliver me like a package?

740
01:06:29,671 --> 01:06:31,597
We were close once

741
01:06:31,632 --> 01:06:34,014
See we started this whole Expendables thing together, see?

742
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:35,626
Look I've got the marks

743
01:06:37,661 --> 01:06:40,852
It's been faded but, we had a falling out

744
01:06:40,887 --> 01:06:42,005
You went dark

745
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,267
And to dark business Barney don't pretend you're not in it

746
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,646
The baddest survive, those are the rules, I didn't make them up

747
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:52,693
You see Barney here was content to work for the small end money

748
01:06:52,728 --> 01:06:54,139
As an employee

749
01:06:54,174 --> 01:06:58,246
Now being boss is more lucrative but that's a concept that somehow eluded you

750
01:06:58,281 --> 01:07:01,269
Plus you got that pesky moral conscience

751
01:07:01,304 --> 01:07:03,229
God that stuff gets in the way

752
01:07:03,264 --> 01:07:04,601
He thinks he's the good guy

753
01:07:04,636 --> 01:07:05,544
Keep talking while you can

754
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:08,566
Sure, you got a conscience that makes you weak

755
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:10,816
Success, real success

756
01:07:10,851 --> 01:07:13,802
Is being willing to do the things that other people are not

757
01:07:13,837 --> 01:07:15,816
Not everyone's as sick as you

758
01:07:15,851 --> 01:07:17,857
Oh, but you are

759
01:07:17,892 --> 01:07:20,183
Kill any Barney

760
01:07:20,218 --> 01:07:22,232
Blow any shit up

761
01:07:22,267 --> 01:07:24,538
How bout you kids? Killed anyone?

762
01:07:24,573 --> 01:07:28,934
Before you all start grabbing bricks to stone me at The Hague

763
01:07:28,969 --> 01:07:32,359
You might want to check your own hands for blood

764
01:07:34,774 --> 01:07:36,600
But I digress. Where was I?

765
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,702
Yes, business is booming right?

766
01:07:38,737 --> 01:07:41,271
A chopper here, a missile there, guns

767
01:07:41,306 --> 01:07:43,443
Whatever, when suddenly

768
01:07:43,478 --> 01:07:44,534
a competitor

769
01:07:44,569 --> 01:07:46,576
I've been calling Uncle Sam a competitor

770
01:07:46,611 --> 01:07:50,614
Hires my own team. Barney and the whole gang to whack me.

771
01:07:50,649 --> 01:07:54,194
Things got ugly real fast and a lot of poeple got dead

772
01:07:54,229 --> 01:07:55,904
3 former brothers in arms

773
01:07:55,939 --> 01:07:58,021
- Shut your mouth.
- 3 Expendables

774
01:07:58,056 --> 01:08:00,550
Our brothers, men we ate with, fart with, bled with, dead!

775
01:08:01,085 --> 01:08:05,572
He puts 3 slugs into my chest thank God for body armor even I thought I was dead

776
01:08:06,507 --> 01:08:11,527
And then he b--- it out with the casualty, all dead!
Because you couldn't stay out of my business!

777
01:08:11,562 --> 01:08:13,782
Shut your mouth!

778
01:08:13,817 --> 01:08:15,338
Go on, do it!

779
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:16,472
Go on!

780
01:08:32,393 --> 01:08:33,615
It's hard enough to fathom

781
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:35,142
I can't believe you forgot

782
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,308
What?

783
01:08:36,343 --> 01:08:39,878
That it's hard to beat an enemy when you're living inside your own head

784
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:42,976
You see you tie me up

785
01:08:43,011 --> 01:08:44,423
Like an animal

786
01:08:44,458 --> 01:08:47,270
Leave me to the slaughter. You humiliate me. Disgrace me.

787
01:08:47,305 --> 01:08:49,697
And when the time comes to kill you

788
01:08:49,732 --> 01:08:53,177
And it will. I will not use a weapon. I will use my hand

789
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:56,163
Because I want you to feel the way that I feel right now

790
01:08:59,889 --> 01:09:00,595
Just cause we were brothers

791
01:09:06,605 --> 01:09:07,156
What's that?

792
01:09:07,191 --> 01:09:10,144
It's GPS tracker

793
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:11,379
How about that?

794
01:10:32,842 --> 01:10:33,728
Hold it

795
01:10:35,518 --> 01:10:36,248
We may need them

796
01:10:37,548 --> 01:10:38,845
I need a body find them

797
01:12:04,090 --> 01:12:05,526
- What happened?
- We found a shitstorm

798
01:12:07,611 --> 01:12:08,504
It's gonna getting worse

799
01:12:08,839 --> 01:12:11,672
This come in for you, 10 minutes ago

800
01:12:15,153 --> 01:12:16,943
Hey Barney

801
01:12:16,978 --> 01:12:19,896
My search party's dead so I'm taking it you're still with us

802
01:12:19,931 --> 01:12:23,938
Now you should've killed me where you had the chance cause that's your last window, and it's gone

803
01:12:23,973 --> 01:12:26,083
Now, I got something to show you here

804
01:12:46,207 --> 01:12:49,469
You want them?

805
01:12:49,504 --> 01:12:50,810
Come get them

806
01:12:52,143 --> 01:12:52,988
What are you gonna do?

807
01:13:21,879 --> 01:13:24,346
Wow, looking a little strung out there kids

808
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:29,462
And this is what you get for being pawns in Barney's moral chess game

809
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:32,132
That 1 looks a little slack

810
01:13:38,494 --> 01:13:40,244
You know I feel most bad for you

811
01:13:40,279 --> 01:13:42,528
I don't give a shit how you feel

812
01:13:42,563 --> 01:13:44,495
I do, I have a daughter

813
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,538
I had feelings, anyway

814
01:13:46,573 --> 01:13:50,008
You know, when the CIA, I, er
presume that's who you're working for

815
01:13:50,043 --> 01:13:51,854
Am I right?

816
01:13:54,102 --> 01:13:55,689
I bet you don't even know who you're working for

817
01:13:55,724 --> 01:13:58,008
But for Barney?

818
01:13:58,043 --> 01:14:00,249
Do you know who's he working for?

819
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:03,501
Does he know who's he working for?

820
01:14:03,536 --> 01:14:04,592
It gets very confusing

821
01:14:05,127 --> 01:14:08,607
Anyway, when the CIA wanted guys doing the dangerous work

822
01:14:08,642 --> 01:14:10,179
in the dangerous places,

823
01:14:10,214 --> 01:14:12,143
they called us. When they didn't want to get their hands dirty,

824
01:14:13,344 --> 01:14:14,650
they called us.

825
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:18,141
Yup, we cleared every hotspot they had

826
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:22,404
We bumped the bad guys so that the good guys could rolled in looking like heroes

827
01:14:27,775 --> 01:14:28,727
We killed a lot

828
01:14:30,093 --> 01:14:31,921
But we saved more lives

829
01:14:31,956 --> 01:14:36,484
Than you can possibly imagined

830
01:14:36,519 --> 01:14:40,301
Then the boys on the hills wanting no loose ends

831
01:14:40,954 --> 01:14:42,262
Tried to bury me

832
01:14:43,703 --> 01:14:45,071
I was an American

833
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:46,804
Working for America

834
01:14:47,962 --> 01:14:48,649
What's?

835
01:14:50,716 --> 01:14:52,236
They'd eat their own children

836
01:14:54,236 --> 01:14:55,450
The lesson here is

837
01:14:56,636 --> 01:14:59,800
Never do business with the government

838
01:15:01,976 --> 01:15:03,553
Never gonna save you that heartache

839
01:15:05,104 --> 01:15:05,521
Never will

840
01:15:19,633 --> 01:15:20,864
So you're getting your old team?

841
01:15:20,899 --> 01:15:22,092
Nah, I've burned that bridge

842
01:15:22,127 --> 01:15:24,372
You know your pride is gonna get you killed

843
01:15:24,407 --> 01:15:25,427
Better me than them

844
01:15:26,738 --> 01:15:28,361
- So you're really gonna go back?
- Yeah

845
01:15:28,396 --> 01:15:29,838
- Alone?
- Yeah

846
01:15:30,966 --> 01:15:32,057
You're an idiot

847
01:15:32,656 --> 01:15:34,027
Thanks for showing up

848
01:15:35,504 --> 01:15:37,021
The I guess our favors are done

849
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:42,784
But you're still an idiot

850
01:16:10,908 --> 01:16:12,044
The hell did you find me?

851
01:16:13,557 --> 01:16:14,924
People talks

852
01:16:14,959 --> 01:16:15,833
I hear things

853
01:16:15,868 --> 01:16:17,626
You got a mission

854
01:16:17,661 --> 01:16:19,173
I can help

855
01:16:19,208 --> 01:16:21,802
My name is Galgo

856
01:16:21,837 --> 01:16:23,482
Let me fill you in

857
01:16:23,517 --> 01:16:25,878
I am good, very good

858
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:27,177
At warfare

859
01:16:27,212 --> 01:16:29,322
You know good memory, afraid of nothing

860
01:16:29,357 --> 01:16:32,171
I want to be your friend

861
01:16:32,206 --> 01:16:33,820
I don't need a friend

862
01:16:34,872 --> 01:16:36,145
Yes, you do

863
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:38,111
Everybody does

864
01:16:38,146 --> 01:16:42,718
I don't have any friends
That's why I know

865
01:16:42,753 --> 01:16:45,217
Besides my friendship issues,

866
01:16:45,252 --> 01:16:47,888
what I really need now is somehting to do

867
01:16:47,923 --> 01:16:50,493
Well not just anything but

868
01:16:51,657 --> 01:16:53,206
what I was born to do

869
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:55,039
It was a 1 way trip

870
01:16:55,074 --> 01:16:56,896
Excuse me sir, but

871
01:16:56,931 --> 01:16:59,007
1 way trip

872
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:00,513
is better than no way

873
01:17:00,648 --> 01:17:02,554
which is the way I live now

874
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:11,129
Help me with the crate

875
01:17:13,757 --> 01:17:15,128
I'm sorry

876
01:17:17,426 --> 01:17:18,995
On the plane Gogo

877
01:17:19,030 --> 01:17:22,398
On the plane, yes. But Gogo no Gogo, Galgo.

878
01:17:23,592 --> 01:17:25,350
- Galgo.
- Gogo sounds like a Parisian hooker.

879
01:17:38,677 --> 01:17:40,745
I am the bridegroom of death

880
01:17:41,516 --> 01:17:44,368
The lyrics of a spanish legion old songs

881
01:17:44,403 --> 01:17:46,482
that we used to sing when we're on a mission in Croatia

882
01:17:46,517 --> 01:17:48,942
That's where I met Mingo

883
01:17:50,106 --> 01:17:52,031
The best point man ever

884
01:17:53,325 --> 01:17:55,414
Some kind of servant you know, ambush

885
01:17:55,449 --> 01:17:57,492
under fire

886
01:17:57,527 --> 01:17:59,146
The coolest cat ever

887
01:17:59,181 --> 01:18:00,551
Just pure eyes in his veins

888
01:18:01,186 --> 01:18:03,521
We were pinned down once like 2 bullets left

889
01:18:04,456 --> 01:18:05,515
I looked over

890
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:07,596
No 1 bit of sweat

891
01:18:12,853 --> 01:18:14,099
Yeah

892
01:18:14,134 --> 01:18:15,790
Can I help you up there

893
01:18:15,825 --> 01:18:17,335
You're a mechanic now?

894
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:20,329
Of course I am a mechanic. I am whatever you need me to be sir.

895
01:18:20,364 --> 01:18:22,195
Ok then just be quiet.

896
01:18:22,230 --> 01:18:23,743
Yes, sir

897
01:18:23,778 --> 01:18:24,685
Tiger,

898
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:26,227
This sniper I knew

899
01:18:26,262 --> 01:18:27,946
I mean, this guy got it all figured out

900
01:18:27,981 --> 01:18:30,161
Wind speed, temperature

901
01:18:30,196 --> 01:18:32,904
Barometric pressure

902
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:35,366
But you know what he says the most important?

903
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:36,312
No

904
01:18:36,347 --> 01:18:37,540
Patience

905
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:39,016
Really?

906
01:18:39,051 --> 01:18:40,174
Yes, I've said this

907
01:18:40,209 --> 01:18:44,890
This thing smells good, what is that?
Kerosene? Gasoline?

908
01:18:44,925 --> 01:18:47,325
Aviation fuel

909
01:18:48,585 --> 01:18:50,274
It's good

910
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:56,369
The best team member ever, his name was Torres

911
01:18:56,404 --> 01:18:57,714
Holy shit

912
01:18:57,749 --> 01:18:59,966
You wouldn't believe what this guy was capable to do

913
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,505
Un-believable

914
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,054
I'm telling you, man.

915
01:19:03,089 --> 01:19:03,566
- Galgo?
- Yes, sir

916
01:19:04,001 --> 01:19:05,930
I think I know why your team let you go

917
01:19:08,414 --> 01:19:08,544
You do?

918
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:11,005
Really?

919
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:14,564
Yes

920
01:19:24,618 --> 01:19:25,942
Last chance

921
01:19:25,977 --> 01:19:27,533
You sure you want to do this?

922
01:19:29,219 --> 01:19:30,444
I like travelling

923
01:19:30,479 --> 01:19:31,395
Good

924
01:19:46,560 --> 01:19:47,998
Uh, who are those guys?

925
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:49,439
My old team

926
01:20:00,258 --> 01:20:01,525
What the hell are you doing here?

927
01:20:02,936 --> 01:20:05,586
You're stupid enough to get yourself into this mess

928
01:20:06,237 --> 01:20:08,573
We're trying to get you out of it

929
01:20:11,904 --> 01:20:12,652
Come on

930
01:20:12,687 --> 01:20:14,059
We leave for war

931
01:20:22,142 --> 01:20:25,161
Galgo you might want to get out of that seat, Christmas is coming

932
01:20:25,899 --> 01:20:26,921
But it's June

933
01:20:26,956 --> 01:20:28,783
Galgo, get the hell out

934
01:20:28,818 --> 01:20:30,607
Yes sir

935
01:20:32,078 --> 01:20:33,872
My hat

936
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:42,486
I'm curious

937
01:20:42,521 --> 01:20:43,020
What?

938
01:20:43,055 --> 01:20:45,091
Since when did suicide become your hobby?

939
01:20:45,126 --> 01:20:46,567
I got a will

940
01:20:46,602 --> 01:20:49,587
You know I'm probably the only friend you got

941
01:20:49,622 --> 01:20:50,825
I got a lot of friends

942
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:52,975
People jump on the tables

943
01:20:55,541 --> 01:20:56,950
I missed you Christmas

944
01:20:56,985 --> 01:20:58,998
I miss you too you demented bastard

945
01:20:59,033 --> 01:21:00,548
You could've loved that demented

946
01:21:02,511 --> 01:21:04,519
Solid structure

947
01:21:05,354 --> 01:21:07,504
That is taking us from 1 place to another

948
01:21:07,539 --> 01:21:08,581
Through unbelievable speeds

949
01:21:09,016 --> 01:21:09,926
Think about it

950
01:21:09,961 --> 01:21:13,932
If God...if God... if he would've liked us you know flying

951
01:21:13,967 --> 01:21:17,238
He would've give us feathers

952
01:21:17,273 --> 01:21:18,849
Do you have feathers?

953
01:21:18,884 --> 01:21:19,900
Do you have feathers?

954
01:21:19,935 --> 01:21:23,026
- I don't have feathers
- It's gonna be a long ass flight fella

955
01:21:23,061 --> 01:21:24,255
It's going to be

956
01:21:24,290 --> 01:21:26,752
It's going to be a long flight but don't worry

957
01:21:26,787 --> 01:21:30,093
I'm here, because I can

958
01:21:31,434 --> 01:21:32,068
Yeah

959
01:21:32,103 --> 01:21:34,597
Thought you should know Barney, you're walking into a shitstorm

960
01:21:34,632 --> 01:21:38,460
NSA ran a signal and frequencies checks on your team's phone

961
01:21:38,495 --> 01:21:40,903
This bastard's not even trying to hide them

962
01:21:40,938 --> 01:21:41,711
Where has he taken them?

963
01:21:41,746 --> 01:21:43,150
They're in

964
01:21:43,185 --> 01:21:44,940
Another honeymoon hotspot

965
01:21:45,315 --> 01:21:46,131
Who is that?

966
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:47,541
Lee Christmas

967
01:21:47,576 --> 01:21:49,512
Not far off Christmas

968
01:21:49,547 --> 01:21:52,326
Stonebanks's compound is where he trained is goons

969
01:21:52,361 --> 01:21:54,581
It's very heavily fortified

970
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:56,018
What's up with the local army?

971
01:21:56,053 --> 01:21:58,184
I don't understand a word this guy is saying

972
01:21:58,219 --> 01:21:59,522
Local army status

973
01:22:00,157 --> 01:22:01,559
Small, corrupt

974
01:22:02,294 --> 01:22:05,489
Stonebanks got all the brass in his pocket

975
01:22:05,524 --> 01:22:09,005
Been running his operations through this shithole of a country for years

976
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:10,310
Wants some advice?

977
01:22:10,345 --> 01:22:13,570
- What's the advice?
- What goddamn language is that?

978
01:22:13,605 --> 01:22:16,340
Look who's talking

979
01:22:16,375 --> 01:22:17,951
What's the advice Drummer?

980
01:22:17,986 --> 01:22:19,527
Forget about what you're thinking

981
01:22:19,562 --> 01:22:20,861
Remember our deal

982
01:22:20,896 --> 01:22:22,123
We need him alive

983
01:22:22,158 --> 01:22:25,175
So he could sit in his courtroom and beat us over the technicality

984
01:22:25,210 --> 01:22:27,583
Those are orders Barney

985
01:22:28,929 --> 01:22:30,614
- You broke the phone
- I got another 1

986
01:22:33,746 --> 01:22:35,191
Think we'll make it back from this 1?

987
01:22:35,226 --> 01:22:36,937
You didn't have to come along

988
01:22:36,972 --> 01:22:38,838
Sure I did

989
01:22:40,856 --> 01:22:42,439
Morons need friends

990
01:22:49,013 --> 01:22:49,892
Gentlemen

991
01:22:49,927 --> 01:22:51,125
Change of plans

992
01:23:08,386 --> 01:23:08,515
This is it?

993
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:10,627
This is your evac team?

994
01:23:10,838 --> 01:23:11,822
Short notice

995
01:23:11,857 --> 01:23:13,019
Yeah

996
01:23:13,054 --> 01:23:14,001
Very short

997
01:23:14,036 --> 01:23:15,940
Where is your team?

998
01:23:15,975 --> 01:23:17,523
Major Drummer?

999
01:23:17,558 --> 01:23:19,637
No team, this one's off the book

1000
01:23:20,871 --> 01:23:22,136
I'm not even here

1001
01:23:23,792 --> 01:23:24,664
Nobody's here

1002
01:23:26,574 --> 01:23:28,113
I thought Church was asshole

1003
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,595
I mean, if you're hysterically strong

1004
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,108
You don't even have to go to the gym

1005
01:23:48,143 --> 01:23:51,030
You are just strong. You just got it

1006
01:23:51,065 --> 01:23:54,888
This is similar to reality

1007
01:23:54,923 --> 01:23:58,015
In the 19th century

1008
01:23:58,050 --> 01:23:59,770
You know what I mean

1009
01:23:59,805 --> 01:24:02,408
Well, this is interesting place

1010
01:24:02,443 --> 01:24:02,544
Give me a migraine

1011
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:04,517
I hear that

1012
01:24:04,852 --> 01:24:05,576
Don't you think?

1013
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:07,503
Look at the bright side

1014
01:24:07,938 --> 01:24:10,368
You run out of bullet

1015
01:24:10,403 --> 01:24:11,672
Roger that

1016
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:14,033
Tall 1 doesn't like me

1017
01:24:14,068 --> 01:24:15,128
He doesn't like anybody

1018
01:24:15,163 --> 01:24:16,496
- What you say?
- He likes you

1019
01:24:28,046 --> 01:24:28,999
The hell is that?

1020
01:24:29,671 --> 01:24:30,864
What?

1021
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,407
The computer strap to your wrist

1022
01:24:32,442 --> 01:24:33,996
Nothing

1023
01:24:33,997 --> 01:24:36,491
The same thing you were busting that kid's balls about

1024
01:24:36,526 --> 01:24:38,047
Nah, I had it for 1

1025
01:24:49,521 --> 01:24:51,138
Why'd your team let you go?

1026
01:24:55,164 --> 01:24:56,192
Why is it matter now?

1027
01:24:56,227 --> 01:24:57,739
I want to know who I'm working with

1028
01:25:02,271 --> 01:25:03,523
They are not around anymore

1029
01:25:07,905 --> 01:25:08,560
So

1030
01:25:10,037 --> 01:25:11,161
This um,

1031
01:25:15,137 --> 01:25:16,058
So why they let you go?

1032
01:25:16,093 --> 01:25:17,954
They didn't

1033
01:25:28,406 --> 01:25:30,263
Benghazi

1034
01:25:30,298 --> 01:25:34,185
I wasn't in the army anymore. We were

1035
01:25:35,046 --> 01:25:37,646
retreating hostage something like uh

1036
01:25:38,908 --> 01:25:40,986
like what we are doing here

1037
01:25:43,343 --> 01:25:46,301
It was a beautiful day

1038
01:25:47,328 --> 01:25:49,660
No problems

1039
01:25:49,695 --> 01:25:52,579
And then it all went bad

1040
01:25:54,367 --> 01:25:56,085
We got hit, got off

1041
01:25:57,213 --> 01:25:59,501
Waited for support, no 1 came

1042
01:26:06,492 --> 01:26:06,538
Everybody died

1043
01:26:11,231 --> 01:26:12,565
Except me

1044
01:26:14,083 --> 01:26:14,927
Ready to go?

1045
01:26:15,946 --> 01:26:17,844
This forces us

1046
01:26:22,067 --> 01:26:23,860
To see

1047
01:26:23,895 --> 01:26:25,583
Yeah

1048
01:26:28,611 --> 01:26:29,838
Thank you

1049
01:27:08,852 --> 01:27:10,150
So what do you think?

1050
01:27:11,496 --> 01:27:13,914
I think we should get this over with

1051
01:27:43,629 --> 01:27:45,005
4 signals

1052
01:27:45,916 --> 01:27:47,155
They are ready

1053
01:27:47,190 --> 01:27:48,767
This is way too wrong

1054
01:27:49,786 --> 01:27:50,946
It's not I don't like it

1055
01:27:50,981 --> 01:27:52,944
You know he got eyes on us now

1056
01:27:52,979 --> 01:27:56,532
- May I suggest something?
- No. No, later.

1057
01:27:56,567 --> 01:27:57,840
That's what I thought

1058
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,278
That's fine

1059
01:29:05,144 --> 01:29:05,551
Go

1060
01:29:38,098 --> 01:29:38,809
Break it

1061
01:29:47,312 --> 01:29:48,255
The hell

1062
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:52,256
Hello Barney

1063
01:29:55,006 --> 01:29:56,133
I knew you couldn't stay away

1064
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:59,051
But I'm relieved someone will take up the kids

1065
01:30:00,006 --> 01:30:03,063
You got them in there, now try gettting them out

1066
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:05,508
But unfortuantely for you

1067
01:30:05,943 --> 01:30:09,133
The entire complex has been wired with C-4

1068
01:30:10,263 --> 01:30:15,173
It takes a regular Joe about 90 seconds to get out of there.
You got, how about 45 seconds?

1069
01:30:29,239 --> 01:30:30,962
He's turned this whole place into a bomb

1070
01:30:33,847 --> 01:30:34,965
Maybe not

1071
01:30:40,441 --> 01:30:42,309
9% battery? You didn't charge it?

1072
01:30:42,344 --> 01:30:44,706
Excuse me but what are you doing?

1073
01:30:44,741 --> 01:30:47,233
Try to run some code, should be able to jam the signal

1074
01:30:47,268 --> 01:30:48,208
Why didn't you think of that?

1075
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:49,655
Well I use it to check the weather

1076
01:30:49,690 --> 01:30:51,308
Will you just shut up and let him do his thing?

1077
01:30:51,343 --> 01:30:52,419
You sure you're gonna do this Thorn?

1078
01:30:52,454 --> 01:30:53,785
I can do it, I can do it.

1079
01:30:59,452 --> 01:31:01,562
Come on, man.

1080
01:31:01,697 --> 01:31:02,748
Come on, man.

1081
01:31:02,783 --> 01:31:04,050
Come on, come on.

1082
01:31:04,085 --> 01:31:06,257
Come on

1083
01:31:06,292 --> 01:31:07,664
Come on

1084
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,578
You're good, come on Thorn.

1085
01:31:13,898 --> 01:31:15,057
Focus, focus.

1086
01:31:15,092 --> 01:31:17,168
Got it

1087
01:31:17,203 --> 01:31:19,767
Good job, my boy

1088
01:31:24,795 --> 01:31:26,972
We lost override. The signal is jammed.

1089
01:31:27,007 --> 01:31:28,686
Send them in

1090
01:31:31,412 --> 01:31:34,369
Barney the battery's at 8%. When this thing died, we lose override.

1091
01:31:34,404 --> 01:31:36,409
That gives us about 25 minutes tops

1092
01:31:39,848 --> 01:31:42,092
Don't pop the bottle yet, we still got troubles

1093
01:31:42,127 --> 01:31:44,061
Big trouble

1094
01:31:58,058 --> 01:31:59,034
Lucky again bro

1095
01:31:59,069 --> 01:32:02,506
Try to enjoy the view because shortly the building that you're currently standing in

1096
01:32:03,041 --> 01:32:05,544
Will be surrounded by the ---stan army

1097
01:32:07,492 --> 01:32:10,159
- How did you shitheads managed to get captured?
- Shut up!

1098
01:32:17,337 --> 01:32:18,504
Step back

1099
01:32:20,460 --> 01:32:23,736
That's about to be an accident.
And we're trapped in here.

1100
01:32:23,771 --> 01:32:27,046
This is exactly what he knew would happen

1101
01:32:27,081 --> 01:32:29,655
Us, tearing at each other

1102
01:32:30,646 --> 01:32:32,269
This stops now

1103
01:32:33,889 --> 01:32:34,552
We can do this

1104
01:32:35,777 --> 01:32:38,415
But only if we do this together

1105
01:32:38,450 --> 01:32:41,045
If we work as a team

1106
01:32:42,795 --> 01:32:44,764
We just may get out of this alive

1107
01:32:47,091 --> 01:32:50,534
And you, I want to make it work

1108
01:32:51,941 --> 01:32:52,865
That simple

1109
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,756
You got any weapons?

1110
01:32:54,791 --> 01:32:57,820
Here's the plan. We're gonna break up into small groups

1111
01:32:57,855 --> 01:32:59,439
And go out to the ground floor

1112
01:32:59,474 --> 01:32:59,520
Get ready

1113
01:33:00,355 --> 01:33:01,265
Come on

1114
01:33:24,582 --> 01:33:26,342
You Stay with me

1115
01:33:26,377 --> 01:33:27,599
Thorn you stay with me. I want you to take Galgo.

1116
01:33:27,634 --> 01:33:28,235
Yeah I don't want to

1117
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,270
What, what? Shhh

1118
01:33:47,875 --> 01:33:49,029
Don't stop

1119
01:33:49,064 --> 01:33:50,540
1 there, 1 there

1120
01:34:03,487 --> 01:34:04,572
There's too many

1121
01:34:04,607 --> 01:34:06,529
They're on our flank. Bring it to them

1122
01:34:24,398 --> 01:34:26,045
That's enough, light them up

1123
01:34:32,937 --> 01:34:33,785
Incoming

1124
01:34:43,837 --> 01:34:46,128
Up the shaft Thorn. You gotta protect the signal jammer

1125
01:35:04,829 --> 01:35:05,990
I thought you could fight

1126
01:35:55,760 --> 01:35:57,566
Jesus God, you're ok?

1127
01:35:57,601 --> 01:35:58,894
Do not worry I love this

1128
01:35:58,929 --> 01:36:00,521
Good keep moving

1129
01:36:49,095 --> 01:36:50,601
Relax

1130
01:36:50,636 --> 01:36:53,021
I told you you'd give yourself a stroke

1131
01:36:54,354 --> 01:36:56,072
We got a tank problem pal

1132
01:36:56,107 --> 01:36:57,404
Do something about it

1133
01:36:57,439 --> 01:36:58,321
I'm on it

1134
01:37:01,166 --> 01:37:01,519
Trench, on your right

1135
01:37:08,012 --> 01:37:08,589
That's gotta hurt

1136
01:37:13,332 --> 01:37:14,980
Drummer's in the house

1137
01:37:39,696 --> 01:37:40,351
Let's go

1138
01:37:42,254 --> 01:37:44,223
Time to pick up the tempo boys

1139
01:37:54,250 --> 01:37:55,401
Look out for the chopper

1140
01:37:55,436 --> 01:37:56,635
Not good

1141
01:37:56,670 --> 01:37:58,433
Hold on

1142
01:38:20,268 --> 01:38:21,920
This does not happen

1143
01:38:21,955 --> 01:38:23,012
You want to do something?

1144
01:38:51,174 --> 01:38:53,102
Beware

1145
01:38:54,216 --> 01:38:55,194
Oh shit

1146
01:39:05,777 --> 01:39:06,576
Hi there

1147
01:39:14,870 --> 01:39:16,463
Closer

1148
01:39:16,498 --> 01:39:18,824
Closer

1149
01:39:22,477 --> 01:39:23,849
Yang, hit something

1150
01:39:30,073 --> 01:39:31,059
Next

1151
01:39:38,134 --> 01:39:39,399
Your name is Luna right?

1152
01:39:39,434 --> 01:39:41,865
Luna means moon

1153
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:45,588
Hypnotic, mysterious, magical, like yourself

1154
01:39:50,056 --> 01:39:52,451
Would you like to hold my gun?

1155
01:39:54,074 --> 01:39:55,410
Goodbye sweet

1156
01:40:01,087 --> 01:40:02,561
There is

1157
01:40:19,650 --> 01:40:20,700
Come on, drive this thing

1158
01:40:29,571 --> 01:40:31,111
See you assholes

1159
01:40:34,012 --> 01:40:34,570
Yeah

1160
01:40:34,605 --> 01:40:36,158
Damn that's cool

1161
01:40:47,064 --> 01:40:48,825
It was all under control

1162
01:40:48,860 --> 01:40:49,989
That's what it looked like

1163
01:42:13,594 --> 01:42:15,810
This the happiest moment of my life

1164
01:42:33,545 --> 01:42:34,839
Jingling jingling

1165
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,418
You finished here?

1166
01:43:04,690 --> 01:43:05,542
Men

1167
01:43:07,916 --> 01:43:09,882
- You're no gonna believe this
- Oh, god

1168
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,675
I've been thinking of you the whole time

1169
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:13,148
Can we just go

1170
01:43:17,435 --> 01:43:18,497
Come on

1171
01:43:19,939 --> 01:43:21,416
Hold up

1172
01:43:24,442 --> 01:43:25,773
Where did you learn how to fly?

1173
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:42,156
Warning, we got reinforcements

1174
01:43:52,990 --> 01:43:53,822
Shit

1175
01:44:00,812 --> 01:44:03,514
Drummer, there's another wave coming

1176
01:44:03,749 --> 01:44:05,502
The only way out is up

1177
01:44:05,937 --> 01:44:06,548
On my way

1178
01:44:07,383 --> 01:44:08,542
Evac in 5

1179
01:44:09,177 --> 01:44:10,418
Got it

1180
01:44:10,453 --> 01:44:11,929
Everybody get to the roof now

1181
01:44:11,964 --> 01:44:13,793
Got it

1182
01:44:20,138 --> 01:44:22,561
Trench, Yang, come on, clear the roof

1183
01:44:22,596 --> 01:44:23,973
Let's go

1184
01:44:40,759 --> 01:44:42,137
Damn

1185
01:45:17,729 --> 01:45:19,556
- Always this easy?
- Pretty much

1186
01:45:19,591 --> 01:45:21,945
How hard can it be to kill 10 men?

1187
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:23,677
You think your idiot can just wound a couple?

1188
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:25,500
Watch closely

1189
01:45:25,535 --> 01:45:26,621
And again

1190
01:45:28,343 --> 01:45:29,256
Anybody else?

1191
01:45:29,291 --> 01:45:31,404
Useless bunch

1192
01:45:33,355 --> 01:45:35,575
You want something done right

1193
01:45:51,131 --> 01:45:52,992
You got that part here

1194
01:45:55,107 --> 01:45:56,548
Yeah the some one right there

1195
01:45:56,583 --> 01:45:57,702
Go go go

1196
01:46:06,358 --> 01:46:07,164
Don't stop

1197
01:46:07,199 --> 01:46:08,552
Come on guys, move it

1198
01:46:31,141 --> 01:46:32,685
Drummer we're pinned down

1199
01:46:32,720 --> 01:46:34,155
Stop mumbling

1200
01:46:38,049 --> 01:46:39,123

1208
01:46:58,625 --> 01:47:00,790

1209
01:47:05,533 --> 01:47:06,564
Batteries at 2%

1210
01:47:11,545 --> 01:47:12,992

1218
01:47:56,922 --> 01:47:58,116
Come on

1219

01:52:15,453 --> 01:52:16,857
Fun is important

1255
01:52:20,374 --> 01:52:21,733
These guys are nuts

01:53:50,387 --> 01:53:52,236
Cheers

1280
01:53:54,123 --> 01:53:57,378
Hey Yang, looks like you had a growth spurt

1281
01:53:57,413 --> 01:53:59,122
Tall people don't live long

1282
01:54:01,021 --> 01:54:02,534
So you're working for Trench now

1283
01:54:03,948 --> 01:54:05,913
I thought you retired

1284

You guys want to get a room?

1287
01:54:22,873 --> 01:54:23,957
So jealous

1288

We came in this thing together, we gonna leave this thing together

1289

01:54:28,572 --> 01:54:30,055
Cheers

1291
01:54:34,847 --> 01:54:37,096
You know for a guy that doesn't take orders very well

1292
01:54:37,131 --> 01:54:38,467
You're pretty good

1293
01:54:38,502 --> 01:54:39,863
Yeah?

1294
01:54:39,898 --> 01:54:41,979
So when do I take over?

1295
01:54:42,014 --> 01:54:44,860
Keep trying

1296
01:54:45,698 --> 01:54:46,682
Hey Smilee

You do good kid

1299
01:55:29,783 --> 01:55:33,047
You look like a proud, demented father

1300
01:55:33,082 --> 01:55:35,549
You could've skip at the demented part

1301
01:55:37,466 --> 01:55:38,730
That was a compliment

1301
01:55:39,305 --> 01:56:39,605
