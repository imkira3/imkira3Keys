3
00:02:08,832 --> 00:02:10,744
We caught the bitch.

4
00:02:26,508 --> 00:02:28,764
Please, don't hurt me.

5
00:02:28,764 --> 00:02:30,902
Don't be afraid, girl.

6
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:34,777
Who are you?

7
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,127
Somebody please help!

8
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:48,496
Only the evil book can undo
what the evil book has done.

9
00:02:48,496 --> 00:02:50,996
Please...
I just want to go home.

10
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:56,409
Please. I just want to go home.

11
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:06,315
Daddy?

12
00:03:09,384 --> 00:03:12,182
Daddy, what are you doing to me?

13
00:03:12,182 --> 00:03:15,406
- Who are these people?
- They're good people.

14
00:03:15,406 --> 00:03:17,640
They're here to help.

15
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,453
What are you talking about?
Where's Mom?

16
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:25,904
Mommy's dead, baby.
You know that.

17
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:34,506
You killed her. You did.

18
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:39,990
No. Why are you saying these things?
Daddy, Please, I just want to go home.

19
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,294
I just want to go home.

20
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:44,887
Do it!
It's the only way to save her soul!

21
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,205
I'm so sorry, baby.

22
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:53,149
Daddy, what is that?
No!

23
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:02,411
Daddy.
Daddy, look. It's me. It's me.

24
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,725
Do it! Give your daughter peace!

25
00:04:05,725 --> 00:04:09,313
I just want you to hold me
and take me home.

26
00:04:09,313 --> 00:04:10,333
Please!

27
00:04:16,062 --> 00:04:17,831
Please, stop.

28
00:04:19,689 --> 00:04:23,294
I will rip your soul out, Daddy.

29
00:04:25,112 --> 00:04:28,748
I'll rip your soul out,
you pathetic fuck!

30
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:37,699
You motherfucker! I will kill you,
like I killed your whore!

31
00:04:42,791 --> 00:04:44,099
Fuck!

32
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:46,787
Fuck!...

33
00:04:55,136 --> 00:04:57,746
I love you, baby.

34
00:05:01,483 --> 00:05:07,633
EVIL DEAD

35
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:27,580
Hey.

36
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,888
How's it going?
Mr. Hot shit city boy.

37
00:06:29,888 --> 00:06:31,551
- Hey, Olivia.
- Come here.

38
00:06:31,998 --> 00:06:34,309
Two arms, please.
Like you missed me.

39
00:06:37,015 --> 00:06:38,438
This is my girl, Natalie.

40
00:06:38,438 --> 00:06:40,625
Oh, the heartbreaker from the carshop.

41
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:42,504
The doctor?

42
00:06:42,504 --> 00:06:45,185
- Actually, she's...
- I'm a registered nurse.

43
00:06:45,185 --> 00:06:48,479
Nurse? Right, sorry.

44
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,781
You were supposed to be here
two hours ago, man.

45
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:53,038
And that's our
irresistibly charming, Eric.

46
00:06:53,038 --> 00:06:55,727
So teaching in high school finally
turned you into a bitter old coot, huh?

47
00:06:55,727 --> 00:06:57,906
No, you did.

48
00:06:58,778 --> 00:07:01,029
Kept us waiting here all morning.

49
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:03,283
Good to see you too, man.
Come here.

50
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,742
You look good.

51
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,643
She's waiting for you at the back.

52
00:07:11,033 --> 00:07:11,850
Great.

53
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:28,285
Hey, Mia.

54
00:07:29,584 --> 00:07:31,355
I'll be damned.

55
00:07:32,665 --> 00:07:34,385
You actually came.

56
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:37,728
Come on, I'm your big brother.
Of course I came.

57
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:40,960
I know I look like roadkill.

58
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,406
No, you look beautiful
as always.

59
00:07:43,406 --> 00:07:45,893
And you're a charming liar.

60
00:07:45,893 --> 00:07:47,801
As always.

61
00:07:49,624 --> 00:07:50,986
Grandpa!

62
00:07:51,562 --> 00:07:55,884
Hey!
Hey there, buddy!

63
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:59,286
We always loved this place,
didn't we?

64
00:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,366
He missed you a lot, you know.

65
00:08:05,814 --> 00:08:07,708
- Oh my God.
- What?

66
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,340
- What is that?
- What?

67
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,771
Just this, right here.
What...

68
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:16,177
It's not funny!

69
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,254
This is...
It's made from a buckthorn tree.

70
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:22,101
It's supposed
to make your will stronger.

71
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:24,255
But I thought you didn't believe
in that kind of stuff.

72
00:08:24,255 --> 00:08:28,210
I don't. But you do,
so maybe it will work.

73
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:30,797
Okay.

74
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,146
Well, then, let's do this.

75
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:42,890
Promise me you'll stay with me
until the end.

76
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,267
- I'm not going anywhere.
- Cross your heart.

77
00:08:46,665 --> 00:08:47,346
Okay.

78
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:50,447
Hope to die.

79
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:55,680
Okay.

80
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,396
May my friends and family,
witness this act.

81
00:09:00,396 --> 00:09:05,369
an irrevocable promise
to my commitment, that...

82
00:09:08,784 --> 00:09:10,078
Fuck it.

83
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:20,768
I promise not to touch this shit
ever again.

84
00:09:25,118 --> 00:09:26,181
Okay.

85
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,275
Let's play cold turkey.

86
00:09:36,282 --> 00:09:37,957
Hopefully, it still works.

87
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:43,243
Wait...

88
00:09:57,174 --> 00:09:58,949
Looks like someone broke in.

89
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,815
Be careful.

90
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:15,032
What's that smell?

91
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,244
Some teenagers probably
just broke in here,

92
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:20,398
to drink beer,
and bump uglies.

93
00:10:20,398 --> 00:10:21,487
Exactly.

94
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,736
Mom would've hated
seeing the cabin like this.

95
00:10:26,736 --> 00:10:27,416
Okay.

96
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:30,580
Let's make this place livable.

97
00:11:07,739 --> 00:11:08,555
Hey.

98
00:11:11,252 --> 00:11:13,091
Are you okay?

99
00:11:13,905 --> 00:11:16,605
Do you remember that lullaby
Mommy used to sing to us?

100
00:11:17,678 --> 00:11:20,634
It was something like...

101
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:25,162
"Baby, you little baby,
it's time to say goodbye."

102
00:11:27,915 --> 00:11:29,341
- "Baby, little baby".
- Mia please...

103
00:11:29,341 --> 00:11:32,234
I don't think you need sad
memories in your head right now.

104
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:35,490
Mom is not a sad one.

105
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,116
You know what I mean.

106
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,730
You know, during her final days
at the hospital,

107
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:47,725
Mom sometimes thought
I was you.

108
00:11:49,316 --> 00:11:52,034
She even called me David
for a whole day, once.

109
00:11:52,034 --> 00:11:55,807
And, I played along.
Because...

110
00:11:55,807 --> 00:11:59,562
Mia, look. I wanted to be there.
Okay, I did.

111
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,662
But by the time Mom got bad,

112
00:12:01,662 --> 00:12:04,242
I had just gotten the job
at the garage in Chicago,

113
00:12:05,994 --> 00:12:09,045
I don't know, I had a hard time
finding the right moment to come back.

114
00:12:10,736 --> 00:12:13,258
And then, it was too late,
so...

115
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:20,970
Maybe you were lucky,
not to see her the way that I did.

116
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,250
Looks like she's doing okay.

117
00:12:57,801 --> 00:12:59,853
David, there's something
you need to know.

118
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:03,529
Okay.

119
00:13:04,776 --> 00:13:07,357
We already tried this whole thing
back in Flint last summer.

120
00:13:08,874 --> 00:13:11,143
Mia made the same promises,

121
00:13:11,143 --> 00:13:15,013
She took the same
dramatic vow of sobriety,

122
00:13:15,013 --> 00:13:16,974
before chucking her dope
down in the toilet.

123
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:19,231
She lasted eight hours and quit.

124
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,725
So, we don't like to give her
that chance this time.

125
00:13:24,725 --> 00:13:26,284
What do you mean?

126
00:13:27,493 --> 00:13:29,809
David, when she breaks,

127
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,579
and believe me,
she will,

128
00:13:33,126 --> 00:13:35,012
we don't want to let her leave.

129
00:13:38,547 --> 00:13:41,159
What do you mean?
You want to force her to stay here?

130
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:41,976
Mia?

131
00:13:43,847 --> 00:13:46,196
This time, the only way,
is the hard way, man.

132
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:50,184
- She won't survive another O.D.
- What?

133
00:13:50,184 --> 00:13:52,436
Mia O.D'd?

134
00:13:52,436 --> 00:13:54,266
She didn't just O.D.

135
00:13:54,266 --> 00:13:56,913
Legally, your sister died.

136
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:59,018
They had to defibrillate her.

137
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,194
Oh, Jesus.

138
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:09,341
Look, we all need to be together on this,
otherwise it won't work.

139
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:11,574
Good boy.

140
00:14:12,507 --> 00:14:15,346
I came here to make things
better with my sister, not worse.

141
00:14:18,413 --> 00:14:20,505
If she asks me to take her home
at some point,

142
00:14:20,505 --> 00:14:22,779
I'm gonna have to do it.

143
00:14:23,841 --> 00:14:26,839
I can't stand it!
I can't stand it! Fuck!

144
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,842
Oh! I can't stand it!

145
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:32,015
I don't know what even that smell!

146
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:33,747
I know. It's Ok.

147
00:14:35,377 --> 00:14:36,735
It's OK, it's OK.

148
00:14:36,735 --> 00:14:39,811
I can't stand
that fucking smell anymore!

149
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:42,003
Calm down, okay?

150
00:14:42,003 --> 00:14:45,028
We're right here.
I know, I know.

151
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:49,825
We're all here.

152
00:14:51,088 --> 00:14:53,294
We're not going anywhere.

153
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:03,157
Withdrawal is kicking in hard enough.

154
00:15:03,157 --> 00:15:04,905
This should be get you
through the night.

155
00:15:06,127 --> 00:15:08,734
I don't know
what is wrong with you people,

156
00:15:08,734 --> 00:15:12,658
but there's something dead
and it reeks.

157
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:14,687
But there's no smell.

158
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,540
You're just extra sensitive right now.

159
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,529
I just can't stand
that fucking smell anymore!

160
00:15:22,435 --> 00:15:23,252
Wait.

161
00:15:33,434 --> 00:15:35,582
Whoa... Is that blood?

162
00:15:51,085 --> 00:15:52,323
Oh, shit.

163
00:15:54,409 --> 00:15:57,294
What's your medical diagnosis now?

164
00:15:57,294 --> 00:15:59,542
It fucking stinks.

165
00:16:01,872 --> 00:16:03,992
Oh, shit. Careful.

166
00:16:03,992 --> 00:16:06,249
These steps are old and rotten
down here.

167
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:09,002
- Yeah, like this whole freaking house.
- I know.

168
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,017
Smells like burned hair.

169
00:16:22,487 --> 00:16:24,234
I think it's back there.

170
00:16:37,057 --> 00:16:38,045
Oh, shit.

171
00:16:45,446 --> 00:16:48,849
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit!

172
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:57,451
- What is this?
- I don't know.

173
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,905
Witchcraft?

174
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:01,054
Who will do this?

175
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:07,585
Shit, something burned here.

176
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:11,475
Look.

177
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:17,871
Shit, man.

178
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,811
What the fuck happened here?

179
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:23,694
Let's not go crazy over this, okay?

180
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:25,343
I'll bury those stink cats
out back later.

181
00:17:25,343 --> 00:17:28,017
Yeah, the smell will be gone
in no time.

182
00:17:28,017 --> 00:17:29,515
Yeah, okay.

183
00:17:30,749 --> 00:17:33,548
And what about the voodoo shit
they did down there, huh?

184
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:37,243
No, no, no.voodoo is more about
dolls, personal artifacts.

185
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:39,752
- This something different.
- Eric, that's enough.

186
00:17:42,306 --> 00:17:44,851
You shouldn't have touched
anything from that basement.

187
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:53,049
"Naturom Demonto".

188
00:20:40,762 --> 00:20:41,859
"Kunda"...

189
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,918
"Astratta"...

190
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,432
"Montosse"...

191
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,926
"Can'da".

192
00:21:16,822 --> 00:21:20,782
Please God,
give me a break.

193
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,458
Mia.

194
00:21:41,117 --> 00:21:42,393
What are you doing?

195
00:21:42,393 --> 00:21:45,293
I'm sorry but I have to get out
of here right now.

196
00:21:46,028 --> 00:21:47,872
No, come on.
Slumber party isn't over yet.

197
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:50,123
Yeah, who will start and play
"Fuck, Marry, Kill." Right?

198
00:21:50,123 --> 00:21:53,711
- Mia, please. Look, Mia...
- I'm going insane here.

199
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:57,305
Olivia, I feel
like I'm loosing my mind.

200
00:21:58,058 --> 00:21:59,829
Mia, what is it?

201
00:22:02,355 --> 00:22:04,458
I will go through with this, okay?

202
00:22:05,027 --> 00:22:07,178
I just...
I can't do it here.

203
00:22:07,178 --> 00:22:08,269
Mia...

204
00:22:10,087 --> 00:22:12,264
We've decided
we're not gonna take you back.

205
00:22:15,724 --> 00:22:17,655
We can't loose you again.

206
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,454
You're gonna have
to stick it out this time.

207
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,429
David, drive me home.

208
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,846
Come on, David.

209
00:22:30,846 --> 00:22:32,511
Mia...

210
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:34,408
Mia, maybe they're right.

211
00:22:37,786 --> 00:22:41,662
You're supposed to be here
to support me, not them.

212
00:22:41,662 --> 00:22:42,418
I'm here for you, Mia...

213
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:44,156
- that's why I came.
- Oh my God.

214
00:22:44,156 --> 00:22:46,394
I'm such an idiot...

215
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:49,693
to think for once in my life,

216
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:51,387
I could count on you.

217
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:56,308
Mia, we're all just trying
to help you!

218
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,405
Yea, well, fuck you very much!

219
00:23:05,423 --> 00:23:06,913
Eric, leave her alone.

220
00:23:07,647 --> 00:23:08,527
Mia.

221
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:22,726
Mia!

222
00:23:26,211 --> 00:23:27,579
Perfect.

223
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:34,512
Fuck this! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

224
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,133
What the fuck am I doing?
What the fuck am I doing?

225
00:25:21,942 --> 00:25:22,759
Mia!

226
00:25:26,907 --> 00:25:27,725
Mia!

227
00:25:37,498 --> 00:25:38,248
Mia.

228
00:25:44,002 --> 00:25:44,751
Mia.

229
00:26:40,049 --> 00:26:40,798
Mia.

230
00:27:33,798 --> 00:27:36,142
Mia!

231
00:27:36,142 --> 00:27:38,321
Mia!

232
00:27:41,897 --> 00:27:43,531
- Mia!
- Oh, shit.

233
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:47,581
Oh my God.

234
00:27:58,299 --> 00:27:59,834
Hey, how is she doing?

235
00:28:01,334 --> 00:28:03,425
She's talking about a woman
in the woods.

236
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:05,139
How the forest attacked her.

237
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,559
I don't know.
It's just crazy withdrawal talk.

238
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,849
Well, don't you think
we should take her to a hospital?

239
00:28:10,849 --> 00:28:12,855
I think we're in over our heads here.

240
00:28:12,855 --> 00:28:16,933
Okay, I'm giving her the exact same
treatment she would get at a hospital.

241
00:28:19,805 --> 00:28:23,456
If we leave now, all of this mess
would've been for nothing.

242
00:28:23,456 --> 00:28:26,267
Ok, what about the wounds
on her arms?

243
00:28:27,471 --> 00:28:29,637
I pulled some thorns out.

244
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:32,449
Looks like she ran into
a thorn bush out there.

245
00:28:32,449 --> 00:28:35,326
She probably did it on purpose.

246
00:28:35,326 --> 00:28:36,459
What?

247
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,064
David...

248
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,107
From now on, she is gonna do
whatever it takes to get out of here.

249
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:02,437
Mia.

250
00:29:04,761 --> 00:29:07,523
Listen, you've gotta get out
of those clothes.

251
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:09,438
- Right? Take a shower.
- David.

252
00:29:11,246 --> 00:29:12,540
Please...

253
00:29:13,815 --> 00:29:15,451
Please...

254
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:20,975
You have to get me...

255
00:29:20,975 --> 00:29:22,338
out of here.

256
00:29:25,538 --> 00:29:27,878
Yeah, but nobody said
this was going to be easy.

257
00:29:27,878 --> 00:29:28,378
No.

258
00:29:31,448 --> 00:29:33,450
You don't understand.

259
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,331
There was something
in the woods, David.

260
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:49,315
And I think it's in here with us now.

261
00:29:50,113 --> 00:29:52,274
What? Here in the room?

262
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:08,320
Look, you know
it's all in your head.

263
00:30:09,762 --> 00:30:11,762
Just try to get it together.

264
00:30:13,659 --> 00:30:17,757
You'll feel better tomorrow, Okay?
You'll be glad we were such assholes.

265
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:21,547
Okay.

266
00:31:00,487 --> 00:31:02,671
Eric, what are you doing in here?

267
00:31:02,671 --> 00:31:04,660
Please, would you just
get rid of that thing?

268
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,381
You should be downstairs
helping your friend clean up that mess.

269
00:31:08,589 --> 00:31:11,251
I don't know
who you're talking about.

270
00:31:11,251 --> 00:31:13,854
Come'on, don't act
like you don't care about him.

271
00:31:13,854 --> 00:31:15,485
I know you do.

272
00:31:16,466 --> 00:31:21,719
Well, I think we can all agree, he hasn't
cared about us for the past freaking century.

273
00:31:22,775 --> 00:31:24,700
Well, he is here now.

274
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:27,572
Yeah.

275
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:33,885
Truly amazing.

276
00:32:06,384 --> 00:32:07,747
Grandpa?

277
00:32:13,287 --> 00:32:14,650
Grandpa?

278
00:32:21,416 --> 00:32:23,278
Grandpa?

279
00:32:23,278 --> 00:32:26,712
Come here, boy.
Fuck!

280
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,138
Grandpa.

281
00:32:40,144 --> 00:32:42,056
No, no, no.

282
00:32:43,099 --> 00:32:44,736
Here, boy.

283
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:54,783
What did you hit into?

284
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:56,841
Fuck.

285
00:32:58,295 --> 00:33:00,536
What happened?

286
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,302
- Mia?
- She's in the shower.

287
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,839
What happened? David?

288
00:33:28,846 --> 00:33:29,663
Mia?

289
00:33:31,329 --> 00:33:32,903
Mia, open the door.

290
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:38,193
Mia, open the door.

291
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:41,400
- Mia, open the door!
- David, what is wrong?

292
00:33:44,112 --> 00:33:46,293
David, stop
and tell me what's going on.

293
00:33:46,293 --> 00:33:49,581
Mia, open the fucking door!

294
00:33:55,375 --> 00:33:58,498
Mia, open the fucking door!

295
00:33:58,498 --> 00:33:59,588
David!

296
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:02,971
David!

297
00:34:05,177 --> 00:34:06,309
Mia!

298
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:12,197
Mia?

299
00:34:13,858 --> 00:34:15,197
Mia?

300
00:34:17,993 --> 00:34:19,028
Olivia!

301
00:34:21,073 --> 00:34:24,665
Holy, shit!
Mia!

302
00:34:36,218 --> 00:34:37,418
Shit!

303
00:34:38,626 --> 00:34:40,239
This is insane!

304
00:34:47,855 --> 00:34:49,264
Fuck! Where is it?

305
00:35:15,452 --> 00:35:17,289
This can't be happening.

306
00:35:42,372 --> 00:35:43,870
I...um... I...

307
00:35:44,694 --> 00:35:47,491
I gave her sedative,
so she should be up for a couple of hours.

308
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:54,167
But, fuck. Her burns are serious.
Like, second, third degree.

309
00:35:54,167 --> 00:35:55,864
This is so wrong.

310
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:58,123
Look, nobody could have known
that she would do something so twisted.

311
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,062
No, you should've known.

312
00:36:00,062 --> 00:36:02,408
We've all been following your way
since we got here.

313
00:36:04,051 --> 00:36:05,731
We should've left
when Mia wanted to.

314
00:36:05,731 --> 00:36:09,844
Baby, please!
Okay, let's not lose our heads. Okay?

315
00:36:09,844 --> 00:36:11,963
With any luck, it'll stop raining
in a couple of hours,

316
00:36:11,963 --> 00:36:13,695
and we'll be able to cross the creek
in the morning,

317
00:36:13,695 --> 00:36:15,356
and we'll take her to a hospital.

318
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:17,806
Okay?
Everything is gonna be fine.

319
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:20,977
Everything is gonna be fine?

320
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:24,559
Everything is gonna be fine.

321
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:30,647
I don't know if you'd noticed this,
but nothing is been fine.

322
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,960
But everything is been getting worse,
every second.

323
00:36:39,562 --> 00:36:40,865
Mia?

324
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:50,257
Mia?

325
00:36:52,428 --> 00:36:54,015
What are you doing?

326
00:36:58,152 --> 00:36:59,874
Mia, put the gun down.

327
00:37:00,983 --> 00:37:03,033
Put the gun down, please.

328
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:09,103
Mia!

329
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,136
Put the fucking gun!

330
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,324
Oh my God!

331
00:37:23,156 --> 00:37:28,861
You will die, like the others!
One by one, we will take you!

332
00:37:31,253 --> 00:37:33,975
You're all going to die tonight.

333
00:37:37,753 --> 00:37:41,199
The gun! The gun, quickly!

334
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:42,461
Baby?

335
00:38:02,323 --> 00:38:03,674
Mia?

336
00:38:14,061 --> 00:38:16,537
Let me out!

337
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:18,700
- Let me out!
- She's totally psychotic.

338
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,360
Oh my God,
What happened to her eyes?

339
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:32,630
What's she doing?

340
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,590
Sounds like she's flinging herself
against something.

341
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,322
This is impossible.

342
00:38:36,322 --> 00:38:38,513
I just gave her enough sedative
to put a horse to sleep!

343
00:38:38,513 --> 00:38:40,385
So give her another shot!

344
00:38:41,866 --> 00:38:43,454
It could bring her into a coma.

345
00:38:43,454 --> 00:38:46,068
For Christ's sake, Olivia,
she's going to kill herself down there!

346
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,100
Go get the shot!

347
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,421
I gotta get the shrapnel
out of my ram.

348
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:55,169
What? I have tweezers in my purse.

349
00:38:56,312 --> 00:38:58,422
David. Listen to me.

350
00:38:58,422 --> 00:39:02,972
I don't think a tranquilizer
is gonna do shit.

351
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:05,899
'Cause I don't think we're dealing
with a freaking panic attack here!

352
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:08,049
I'm scared that
what's happening to Mia...

353
00:39:08,049 --> 00:39:11,186
has something to do with that
fucking witchcraft in the basement.

354
00:40:34,413 --> 00:40:35,712
Olivia?

355
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,778
Olivia?

356
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:10,645
Olivia?

357
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:13,708
Are you okay?

358
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,976
Olivia?

359
00:41:43,726 --> 00:41:47,161
Olivia?
What are you doing in there?

360
00:41:50,955 --> 00:41:52,182
Olivia.

361
00:41:55,544 --> 00:41:56,840
Olivia?

362
00:42:01,115 --> 00:42:02,957
Are you okay?

363
00:42:07,511 --> 00:42:09,363
Oh my God!

364
00:42:09,363 --> 00:42:11,803
Why the fuck did you do that?

365
00:42:34,444 --> 00:42:35,602
Kill him.

366
00:43:15,569 --> 00:43:16,112
No!

367
00:43:28,201 --> 00:43:32,496
She tried to kill me.
She tried to kill me.

368
00:43:49,019 --> 00:43:51,002
Fuck it.

369
00:43:53,254 --> 00:43:54,953
Hold that. You got it?

370
00:44:06,205 --> 00:44:08,573
Hold here, okay? Hold.

371
00:44:08,573 --> 00:44:09,529
Fuck it.

372
00:44:12,873 --> 00:44:17,506
David, I did something terrible.

373
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:19,994
I'm sure you didn't mean to hurt her.

374
00:44:19,994 --> 00:44:23,238
That thing I killed, was not Olivia.

375
00:44:23,238 --> 00:44:24,749
He's losing too much blood.

376
00:44:24,749 --> 00:44:27,441
Baby, he needs
water and sugar, okay? Go.

377
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:30,641
- Go!
- Okay, okay.

378
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:36,059
- Alright.
- David...

379
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:43,582
I read a passage from that book.
It was some sort of a prayer.

380
00:44:44,886 --> 00:44:47,195
I unleashed something, David.

381
00:44:48,829 --> 00:44:52,604
I unleashed something evil.

382
00:45:54,048 --> 00:45:55,343
Natalie?

383
00:46:04,114 --> 00:46:05,279
Mia?

384
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:08,311
Natalie.

385
00:46:12,685 --> 00:46:14,967
What am I doing down here?

386
00:46:17,223 --> 00:46:19,065
My leg's hurt.

387
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:23,142
I can't move.

388
00:46:26,328 --> 00:46:28,043
I'm coming down there, okay?

389
00:46:30,322 --> 00:46:33,841
Why did you lock me down here?

390
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:39,078
- You were supposed to help me.
- Hey, we're trying to help you. Okay?

391
00:46:39,584 --> 00:46:42,647
You were out of control, you know?

392
00:46:42,647 --> 00:46:45,675
You got violent and we didn't know
what else to do.

393
00:46:46,425 --> 00:46:50,776
Mia, I think something
really terrible was happened,

394
00:46:50,776 --> 00:46:52,750
and we have
to get out of here now, okay?

395
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:58,141
You don't understand...
He's not gonna let you leave.

396
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:01,730
And he's not gonna stop
until he has you.

397
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,511
Until he has all of you!

398
00:48:17,379 --> 00:48:20,423
I can smell your filthy soul.

399
00:48:47,187 --> 00:48:49,147
Kiss me, you dirty cunt!

400
00:49:07,234 --> 00:49:10,534
Why don't you come down here
and let me suck your cock, pretty boy?

401
00:49:10,879 --> 00:49:13,748
- Mia...
- Mia is not here, you fucking idiot!

402
00:49:15,431 --> 00:49:18,294
Your little sister is been raped in hell!

403
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:36,107
I wanna go home.

404
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:53,494
Eric?

405
00:49:55,546 --> 00:49:57,992
I don't know why,
but I thought that this would end it.

406
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:04,407
But this book, does not burn.

407
00:50:06,751 --> 00:50:09,128
It does not fucking burn.

408
00:50:12,301 --> 00:50:13,980
Tell me what's going on here.

409
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,369
This book, using some...

410
00:50:32,008 --> 00:50:33,899
ancient alphabet.

411
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:38,366
Here's some translations,
but it's just a scattered written notes.

412
00:50:39,242 --> 00:50:41,121
They all refer to some...

413
00:50:42,712 --> 00:50:45,342
"evil entity"...

414
00:50:45,342 --> 00:50:47,313
A taker of souls.

415
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:50,084
A demon.

416
00:50:51,869 --> 00:50:53,432
It says...

417
00:50:55,065 --> 00:50:57,379
Once he feasts on five souls,

418
00:50:57,379 --> 00:51:02,045
the sky will bleed again,
and the abomination...

419
00:51:02,045 --> 00:51:04,629
will rise from hell.

420
00:51:47,730 --> 00:51:48,531
This is insane.

421
00:51:48,531 --> 00:51:53,264
This "thing" is attached
to Mia's soul like a leech.

422
00:51:53,264 --> 00:51:56,018
It's becoming her.

423
00:51:56,018 --> 00:52:00,514
If we wanna stop this,
if we want to help Mia...

424
00:52:07,288 --> 00:52:10,260
I think we gonna have to kill her.

425
00:52:11,782 --> 00:52:14,040
- What did you say?
- If everything said...

426
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,382
Eric!
We're not gonna fucking kill anybody!

427
00:52:17,382 --> 00:52:19,235
Are you listening to yourself?

428
00:52:20,836 --> 00:52:22,876
What about those dead cats
down the basement?

429
00:52:22,876 --> 00:52:24,566
I mean, maybe they had some disease.

430
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:27,170
I mean, some virus that...
it spread to Mia...

431
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:31,522
and then she passed it to Olivia,
when she puked all over her face.

432
00:52:31,522 --> 00:52:36,148
But what kind of a virus, makes a person
cutoff their face with a piece of glass?

433
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:41,466
Oh my God!
Oh God!

434
00:52:56,732 --> 00:53:00,253
I don't know,
what we're dealing with here. Okay?

435
00:53:00,253 --> 00:53:01,773
But it stopped raining,

436
00:53:01,773 --> 00:53:04,201
and in a couple of hours,
the river will be clear,

437
00:53:04,201 --> 00:53:08,189
and we're gonna get out
of this place, all of us.

438
00:53:08,189 --> 00:53:10,915
It doesn't matter where we go.

439
00:53:10,915 --> 00:53:13,731
If we don't do something right now,

440
00:53:13,731 --> 00:53:16,316
we're all gonna be dead by then!

441
00:53:53,771 --> 00:53:55,857
Don't do it, you little bitch!
Don't cut it off!

442
00:54:04,687 --> 00:54:06,482
Don't cut it off!

443
00:54:06,482 --> 00:54:07,772
Fuck you!

444
00:54:15,361 --> 00:54:18,080
No, no, no, no, no!

445
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:20,574
No, no!

446
00:55:09,231 --> 00:55:09,771
I promise you,
everything's gonna be fine.

447
00:55:09,771 --> 00:55:12,694
Okay? Okay, baby?

448
00:55:12,694 --> 00:55:15,655
She just cut her fucking arm off.

449
00:55:15,655 --> 00:55:17,542
Does this sound fine to you?

450
00:55:28,268 --> 00:55:32,457
These inscriptions are confusing
and sometimes contradictory.

451
00:55:32,457 --> 00:55:34,695
But they're consistent
about one thing:

452
00:55:36,031 --> 00:55:41,228
In order to stop this,
the possessed must be cleansed.

453
00:55:41,228 --> 00:55:43,182
Purified.

454
00:55:43,613 --> 00:55:46,648
The book describes three specific ways.

455
00:55:49,041 --> 00:55:51,004
A live burial...

456
00:55:55,093 --> 00:55:59,112
bodily dismemberment...

457
00:56:02,628 --> 00:56:05,528
and purification by fire.

458
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,196
Are you sure that this will work?

459
00:56:13,087 --> 00:56:14,446
If we...

460
00:56:16,979 --> 00:56:21,458
If I killed my sister,
she'll be at peace?

461
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:26,658
Am I sure? Of course not.
This is not a science book.

462
00:56:27,770 --> 00:56:29,707
But look, I'm sure of one thing.

463
00:56:29,707 --> 00:56:34,185
Whatever is inside Mia,
is the cause of all this.

464
00:56:34,804 --> 00:56:38,078
If she dies,
then this thing is gonna die with her.

465
00:56:38,078 --> 00:56:40,278
What if she just lost her mind?

466
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,487
What if she just needs a doctor?

467
00:56:44,487 --> 00:56:46,230
What? A doctor?

468
00:56:47,952 --> 00:56:51,462
My Mom died in a mental hospital,
she was crazy.

469
00:56:51,462 --> 00:56:53,902
She was deranged,
she was a monster.

470
00:56:55,824 --> 00:56:58,686
I've always feared that me and Mia
would end up like her.

471
00:57:07,044 --> 00:57:10,148
You're just a fucking coward.

472
00:57:11,336 --> 00:57:13,434
You know exactly
what we have to do,

473
00:57:13,434 --> 00:57:15,950
but you're too scared
to go through with it.

474
00:57:17,213 --> 00:57:19,761
I'm gonna burn
this fucking place down.

475
00:57:19,761 --> 00:57:21,942
and I'm gonna end this nightmare.

476
00:57:23,675 --> 00:57:26,464
Why don't you just run away?

477
00:57:26,951 --> 00:57:30,281
Go hide beneath some rock
somewhere.

478
00:57:30,281 --> 00:57:32,722
You know, You're great at that.

479
00:57:38,766 --> 00:57:40,040
Oh, shit!

480
00:58:56,551 --> 00:58:57,993
Where the fuck did she go?

481
00:58:58,426 --> 00:58:59,448
David.

482
00:59:00,962 --> 00:59:03,489
Take it before she does.

483
00:59:39,065 --> 00:59:40,078
No!

484
00:59:42,732 --> 00:59:43,983
Stop!

485
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:56,334
No, no, no, no!

486
00:59:56,334 --> 00:59:59,050
No!
No, no, no!

487
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,969
David.

488
01:00:36,050 --> 01:00:37,484
Why are you hurting me?

489
01:00:45,641 --> 01:00:47,256
My face hurts.

490
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,458
Why?

491
01:00:51,726 --> 01:00:55,411
Why? Why's my face hurt me?

492
01:00:56,862 --> 01:00:58,883
Baby, baby...

493
01:00:59,664 --> 01:01:01,230
Nat, Nat.

494
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:39,334
Come on. Come on, man.
Here we are.

495
01:01:43,864 --> 01:01:46,650
Hey, hey, hey!
Hold on!

496
01:01:46,650 --> 01:01:48,608
Don't die on me, please.

497
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:51,956
It wouldn't be so bad right now.

498
01:01:54,426 --> 01:01:58,438
I just don't want to become
the devil's bitch.

499
01:02:02,834 --> 01:02:04,341
I'm gonna do what I gotta do.

500
01:02:06,412 --> 01:02:08,870
I'm gonna do what I gotta do, OK?

501
01:02:57,343 --> 01:02:59,224
I'm sorry, Mia.

502
01:03:00,532 --> 01:03:01,922
I love you.

503
01:03:03,711 --> 01:03:11,140
Baby, little baby,
it's time to say goodbye.

504
01:03:12,055 --> 01:03:19,710
Baby, little baby,
I'll miss you day and night.

505
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:26,301
Baby, my sweet baby,
I'll write you everyday.

506
01:03:27,331 --> 01:03:35,224
Baby, don't cry baby.
I wish that I can stay.

507
01:03:35,861 --> 01:03:37,434
I can't do this.

508
01:03:40,080 --> 01:03:41,748
I can't do this.

509
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:20,232
This time... the only fucking way...
is the hard way!

510
01:05:00,288 --> 01:05:02,459
David.

511
01:05:03,093 --> 01:05:06,014
Murderer.

512
01:05:06,996 --> 01:05:09,264
Coward.

513
01:07:11,567 --> 01:07:13,078
Eric.

514
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,789
Hey, are you okay?

515
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:38,148
David.

516
01:07:40,158 --> 01:07:41,915
I missed you, man.

517
01:07:46,147 --> 01:07:48,483
You know that, buddy.

518
01:09:08,507 --> 01:09:09,524
David.

519
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:13,670
David?

520
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:17,585
I can't move! I can't breath!

521
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:19,000
David?

522
01:09:20,127 --> 01:09:22,687
Help me!

523
01:09:23,131 --> 01:09:25,000
Help me, David!

524
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,925
- You're not her.
- David!

525
01:09:28,589 --> 01:09:30,412
Help me!

526
01:09:30,412 --> 01:09:32,148
You're not her!

527
01:09:38,563 --> 01:09:40,700
Why do you hate me David?

528
01:09:43,216 --> 01:09:45,150
I know you do.

529
01:09:46,469 --> 01:09:48,305
You left home.

530
01:09:49,410 --> 01:09:53,992
You left me all alone
with our sick mother.

531
01:09:53,992 --> 01:09:55,846
And I was just a kid.

532
01:09:57,619 --> 01:09:59,096
You made me lie.

533
01:10:00,639 --> 01:10:05,989
Every time she screamed your name,
I told her you where coming to see her.

534
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:08,036
Like you promise.

535
01:10:08,774 --> 01:10:11,064
But you never did.

536
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:15,469
Please stop it.
I'm begging you.

537
01:10:16,628 --> 01:10:21,870
I know mother hates you now...
and she waits for you in hell.

538
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:33,878
Shut up! Shut up!

539
01:10:51,286 --> 01:10:53,405
I'm so sorry, Mia.

540
01:10:57,313 --> 01:10:58,926
I should've been there.

541
01:11:00,720 --> 01:11:03,463
I should've been there for you.

542
01:11:58,450 --> 01:12:00,738
Come on. Please, come back.

543
01:12:06,935 --> 01:12:09,504
Come on, Mia! Come back for me!
Come on, please!

544
01:12:53,024 --> 01:12:55,397
Okay, you're in peace.

545
01:12:56,728 --> 01:12:58,759
You're in peace now.

546
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:26,492
David?

547
01:13:32,894 --> 01:13:34,280
Mia?

548
01:13:40,395 --> 01:13:42,808
It was so horrible.

549
01:13:44,612 --> 01:13:47,178
It was so horrible.

550
01:13:47,178 --> 01:13:51,208
It's okay. It's all over now.

551
01:13:53,992 --> 01:13:57,635
Thanks for not leaving me, David.

552
01:14:06,094 --> 01:14:09,029
Wait here.
I'm gonna get the car keys.

553
01:14:09,029 --> 01:14:11,007
- Okay?
- Yeah.

554
01:15:13,988 --> 01:15:15,691
David?

555
01:15:16,321 --> 01:15:18,429
Go! Please, just go!

556
01:15:18,429 --> 01:15:19,716
Go!

557
01:15:19,716 --> 01:15:23,073
I'm not gonna go anywhere!
I'm not going anywhere!

558
01:15:27,191 --> 01:15:29,358
Mia, take the keys.
Look at me, let's go.

559
01:15:29,358 --> 01:15:31,026
Come on. Come on, let's go.

560
01:15:36,763 --> 01:15:38,382
Get out of here.

561
01:15:39,579 --> 01:15:42,845
No! No!

562
01:15:42,845 --> 01:15:44,239
David!

563
01:15:44,828 --> 01:15:46,816
David!

564
01:15:48,326 --> 01:15:53,000
No! No! No!

565
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,376
David! David!

566
01:16:05,159 --> 01:16:07,948
He's coming.

567
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:42,509
Mia.

568
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:42,657
Come here, bitch!

569
01:21:07,787 --> 01:21:08,737
Come on!

570
01:22:06,257 --> 01:22:09,764
You're gonna die here,
you pathetic junkie!

571
01:22:12,179 --> 01:22:14,692
I've had enough of this shit!

572
01:22:51,289 --> 01:22:54,877
I will feast on your soul!

573
01:22:58,191 --> 01:23:00,262
Feast on this, motherfucker!

574
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,874
Die!

575
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:37,229
Go back to hell, bitch!

576
01:25:11,676 --> 01:25:14,062
