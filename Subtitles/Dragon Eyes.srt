2
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:51,205
What's up?

3
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:57,754
You're in my fucking spot.

4
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:09,766
You're still in my fucking spot.
Are you hard of hearing?

5
00:04:59,394 --> 00:05:04,232
What's up, man? That shit was
shorter than Danny DaVito.

6
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:27,171
Get out of here!

7
00:05:37,056 --> 00:05:40,643
- Don't fucking touch me!
- I'm sick of these guys.

8
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:18,389
Check it out, Hong Kong.
We didn't order no Chinese food.

9
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:26,814
Grandpa, please. I'm leaving now...

10
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:32,612
- Can I help you?
- Here for the apartment.

11
00:06:34,906 --> 00:06:39,035
Grandpa, someone's here
for the apartment.

12
00:06:49,295 --> 00:06:52,465
No drugs, no smoking,
no dogs, no loud music.

13
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:56,010
No friends coming in and
out late at night.

14
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:05,019
Hola, preciosa!

15
00:07:05,186 --> 00:07:09,315
Talk with us for a second.
Come on pretty girl.

16
00:07:17,365 --> 00:07:21,411
I don't want any trouble.

17
00:07:24,872 --> 00:07:27,834
Yo, check it out.

18
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,296
Look, I know you see me here
all the time, you don't want this?

19
00:07:32,463 --> 00:07:37,301
- Chinga por Ia madre.
- Hija de Ia gran puta!

20
00:07:37,468 --> 00:07:40,596
Fucking bitch. Kick rocks, then.

21
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:54,986
Hey, Theo, look over here.
It's the Chino!

22
00:08:05,788 --> 00:08:12,795
Hong Kong, it costs a bill
to park here, Chino.

23
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,555
Never touch my car.

24
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:31,773
Puta, are you fucking crazy?

25
00:09:08,226 --> 00:09:10,937
Hold the motherfucker.

26
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:44,048
Damn homeboy - these Percs
got me all fucked up.

27
00:11:45,466 --> 00:11:50,638
- What the fuck happened?
- Dash, before you get on my ass...

28
00:11:50,805 --> 00:11:54,559
What the fuck happened?

29
00:11:54,725 --> 00:12:00,648
This fucking chino went crazy,
smiled took my wallet, broke my arm.

30
00:12:00,815 --> 00:12:06,237
- Get the fuck out of here.
- I'll take care of it. Don't worry.

31
00:12:07,405 --> 00:12:11,075
Didn't hear?
Get the fuck out of here.

32
00:12:25,047 --> 00:12:31,095
Get on this shit. We need to know
if Antuan's moving in on me.

33
00:12:31,262 --> 00:12:34,515
- I'm sorry?
- I'll take care of it.

34
00:12:34,682 --> 00:12:37,310
Ahora!

35
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:56,079
- Raise.
- Most like money, but damn.

36
00:13:07,423 --> 00:13:11,260
One of Dash's boys just got
handled on their block-

37
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:17,058
-by one cat. You go find this dude.
Do you hear me?

38
00:13:17,225 --> 00:13:23,898
If he could handle all the men by
himself, we could probably use him.

39
00:13:25,525 --> 00:13:30,363
Since y'all are all blah, blah, blah,
let's see how much you want to do it.

40
00:13:31,614 --> 00:13:34,242
All in.

41
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:13,448
I really have tried.
Some things just never change.

42
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:10,213
She's dead.

43
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:17,845
I tried, but I couldn't stop it.

44
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:25,978
Nothing can change that.
Put it behind you.

45
00:15:30,191 --> 00:15:33,027
Can you do that?

46
00:15:33,194 --> 00:15:35,279
How?

47
00:15:44,956 --> 00:15:47,917
Stand up.

48
00:15:55,091 --> 00:15:58,719
Lie on the ground.

49
00:15:58,886 --> 00:16:04,684
Get kicked like a dog. Stand like
a man, get kicked like a man.

50
00:16:09,063 --> 00:16:12,442
Are you angry?

51
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,328
You've got two tigers inside you.
A weak one, who does not believe...

52
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:28,833
...and a courageous one, who does.

53
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,336
Which one will win?

54
00:16:33,671 --> 00:16:36,758
The one you feed.

55
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:17,131
Gimme the key. Ever since we run
the Dogs out, it's been good money.

56
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:23,679
Smooth like mayonnaise,
or a baby cheek.

57
00:17:23,846 --> 00:17:26,224
Where we dropping this money?

58
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:30,978
I think...fifth row, second stack.

59
00:17:33,481 --> 00:17:37,568
They could have told us all this shit
was gonna be wrapped up.

60
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:40,822
Mike?

61
00:17:40,988 --> 00:17:42,990
Mikey?

62
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:47,078
Mike?

63
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,790
Mike?

64
00:18:11,853 --> 00:18:14,647
So, you calling me a liar?

65
00:18:14,814 --> 00:18:18,276
Not calling you a liar.
I call you a cheater!

66
00:18:18,443 --> 00:18:22,989
You know what's your problem is.
You have a habit getting in the way.

67
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:26,033
Last thing you say before
I beat your ass!

68
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,912
You and your loco friend.
Where's the money?

69
00:18:30,079 --> 00:18:33,082
Gentlemen!

70
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:41,132
I use that term with
the greatest liberty.

71
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:50,475
So we have a dilemma.
The floor's open.

72
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:54,604
He's getting greedy,
trying to break the peace.

73
00:18:54,771 --> 00:18:58,691
This mierda puta
took the bags.

74
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:02,361
We made the drop.
You believe this crack head?

75
00:19:02,528 --> 00:19:05,448
Silencio! Basta!

76
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,417
We have a more pertinent and
important dilemma here. My take.

77
00:19:16,584 --> 00:19:23,382
By all accounts, the figure
should start with a three.

78
00:19:25,051 --> 00:19:27,470
But all I've got is a two.

79
00:19:27,637 --> 00:19:32,850
Easy... - Stop crying
and pick up the money.

80
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:39,607
Now you pick him up. Don't
look at him. Pick him up.

81
00:19:40,525 --> 00:19:47,782
We're going to count the money,
in twos. Ready, set, go.

82
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:52,495
Two, four, six.

83
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:56,624
- Eight, a thousand.
- A thousand.

84
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:01,712
- Are you listening?
- Two, four, six, eight.

85
00:20:03,297 --> 00:20:09,846
- Two thousand.
- Two. Not three.

86
00:20:10,012 --> 00:20:14,183
- Enough.
- Not enough. You fix it.

87
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,813
I don't give a shit what happens
between Spics and Schwartzes.

88
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,651
I don't eat fried bananas and
I don't eat collard greens.

89
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:32,076
Shut up! Don't ever be short on my
cut again. Fix it by midnight.

90
00:20:34,579 --> 00:20:36,873
Okay?

91
00:20:44,756 --> 00:20:47,425
Messing up my business.

92
00:21:44,357 --> 00:21:47,026
Where's my fucking money!

93
00:21:48,152 --> 00:21:51,114
Where's my fucking money?

94
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:58,704
What does this mean?
Where's my fucking money?

95
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:06,045
We kill each and every one of these
fucking putos. Vamanos!

96
00:22:44,417 --> 00:22:47,754
Where's the fucking money?

97
00:22:52,383 --> 00:22:56,804
Is this a fucking joke to you?
What does this mean?

98
00:22:58,765 --> 00:23:01,851
It's the symbol for change.

99
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:06,189
- Who did this?
- Think, man.

100
00:23:06,355 --> 00:23:09,984
- Hong?
- Exactly.

101
00:23:11,736 --> 00:23:14,989
Vamanos! Let's kill this puto.

102
00:23:15,907 --> 00:23:21,537
Hey, Djingis. Exactly how do you
expect to get your money?

103
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:29,629
You can't get bread from a dead man.

104
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,939
Down on your knees!

105
00:27:41,214 --> 00:27:46,719
Legs to the back.
Now, put your knees forward.

106
00:27:47,595 --> 00:27:52,975
Keep your fear inside. Understand?

107
00:27:55,395 --> 00:27:57,563
Chair.

108
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:02,693
Use the position...instinctively.

109
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,573
You are in enclosed
space...point of kicking.

110
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:14,205
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

111
00:28:14,372 --> 00:28:20,253
Pow, you have connected.
I will show you.

112
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:23,464
You kick slowly.

113
00:28:23,631 --> 00:28:29,387
Stop. There, do you see?
Much better.

114
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:32,682
Guard. Foot.

115
00:28:37,854 --> 00:28:44,193
Relaxed.
Breathe, breathe.

116
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:48,740
That's good. Okay. Now, here.

117
00:28:50,324 --> 00:28:54,370
Pull it back. Use the balance.

118
00:29:54,055 --> 00:29:57,433
Do you have fucking problem?

119
00:30:47,024 --> 00:30:50,194
Hong. Let's go.

120
00:31:03,958 --> 00:31:06,669
Mr. Hong.

121
00:31:11,841 --> 00:31:15,970
My grandfather's name
was Vittorio Cigno.

122
00:31:16,137 --> 00:31:20,516
That's the English bastardization
of a beautiful name.

123
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:27,190
Victor Swan.
But you can call me Mr. V.

124
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:33,696
So why are you here?
And not the bad guys.

125
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:36,449
I arrested you for your protection.

126
00:31:36,616 --> 00:31:41,871
- What protection?
- Same as I give everyone in town.

127
00:31:44,207 --> 00:31:49,003
You want to play rough,
you play by the rules.

128
00:31:49,879 --> 00:31:53,925
- Where's the money?
- At the warehouse.

129
00:31:54,092 --> 00:31:57,428
6th row. 2nd stack.
4th from the bottom.

130
00:31:57,595 --> 00:32:00,014
Is that so?

131
00:32:02,975 --> 00:32:09,190
Check the warehouse. Sixth row,
second stack.

132
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:13,152
Fourth from the bottom,
call me when you get there.

133
00:32:13,319 --> 00:32:18,908
Mr. Hong, I have to know if I can
trust you. This is Mr. Beech.

134
00:32:19,075 --> 00:32:23,413
He's become a liability.
The address is on the back.

135
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:29,252
There's only one game here.
My game.

136
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,261
Very good. Well...

137
00:32:43,307 --> 00:32:47,145
Welcome to St. Jude.

138
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,199
No!

139
00:34:10,103 --> 00:34:12,939
Come in.

140
00:34:17,068 --> 00:34:22,115
- How did you get out ofjail?
- They let me go.

141
00:34:22,281 --> 00:34:26,702
Is that how you think you're gonna
solve St. Jude's problems?

142
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:32,208
- It's a start.
- Until they kill you.

143
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:36,087
Everyone dies.

144
00:34:37,547 --> 00:34:40,842
My grandfather wants you out.

145
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:46,973
If you want me to leave, I'll leave.

146
00:34:50,143 --> 00:34:54,522
Just...be careful who you hurt.

147
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:52,413
I swear to God,
I'm losing my mind.

148
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,416
I'm not bugging,
I heard these things.

149
00:35:55,583 --> 00:36:00,588
They walk around in
little shoes and shit.

150
00:36:00,755 --> 00:36:03,674
They're in the fucking walls, Tony.

151
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:16,729
The other night, I'm laying here and
I open my eyes. See that?

152
00:36:16,896 --> 00:36:20,274
Those motherfucking eyes are
looking at me!

153
00:36:20,441 --> 00:36:23,903
What's funny?
What are you laughing about?

154
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:27,323
- Take it down!
- That's sacred shit!

155
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:31,411
- Calm down.
- I'm not high!

156
00:36:31,577 --> 00:36:34,872
I don't have to calm down.
Don't I look calm?

157
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:38,376
I didn't come here for this shit.

158
00:36:40,711 --> 00:36:44,757
- Tell me you didn't hear that.
- I didn't hear shit.

159
00:36:44,924 --> 00:36:47,468
- There's somebody here.
- Calm down.

160
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:52,723
Get down? I'm not dying on my
knees, I'm standing on my feet.

161
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,811
- Fuck you! Fuck you!
- Sit down!

162
00:36:56,978 --> 00:37:00,940
- Fuck you. Bring it, bitch!
- Shut up!

163
00:37:01,107 --> 00:37:04,694
- You're bugging!
- Don't forget who I am.

164
00:37:04,861 --> 00:37:07,405
- I'm burning myself.
- Sit down!

165
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:10,867
Get your ass up and
check out behind the wall.

166
00:37:11,033 --> 00:37:14,328
- You've got the gun!
- I've got your back.

167
00:37:14,495 --> 00:37:17,707
You go. If something happens,
I've got you.

168
00:37:17,874 --> 00:37:22,712
And you're smoking my shit,
look at all the shit you're smoking.

169
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:27,216
Smoking shit, you're popping pills.
Get the fuck out, man.

170
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:31,888
What the fuck? You're throwing
fucking guns at me?

171
00:37:32,054 --> 00:37:36,642
From here, I'll get that reach
and knock you out.

172
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:39,687
Don't trick me.

173
00:37:39,854 --> 00:37:41,355
Towel. Oh, fuck.

174
00:37:44,025 --> 00:37:46,235
Tony!

175
00:37:48,696 --> 00:37:52,408
- Don't shush me!
- Shut up!

176
00:37:54,744 --> 00:37:57,580
Look in the wall! Tony!

177
00:38:03,169 --> 00:38:05,588
Yo, Beech.

178
00:38:08,508 --> 00:38:12,678
- Your door is open.
- What are you, retarded?

179
00:38:12,845 --> 00:38:17,141
- I did shut it when I got here!
- Then close it again!

180
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,939
- What the fuck? Tony!
- There's a guy over here!

181
00:38:23,106 --> 00:38:27,985
- Who'd be in here?
- A fucking ninja!

182
00:38:28,152 --> 00:38:30,279
- A ninja?
- I'm out of here!

183
00:38:30,446 --> 00:38:35,743
You're goddamn right, you're outta
here. Get the fuck out.

184
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:03,271
No, don't kill me!

185
00:39:03,438 --> 00:39:05,898
Bang.

186
00:39:06,065 --> 00:39:10,027
I killed you, understand?

187
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:16,075
Get out of town and
never come back.

188
00:39:25,752 --> 00:39:28,254
You're late, douchebags.

189
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:33,426
The old man don't like late.

190
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:43,936
- Spit it out.
- Where's our protection?

191
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:46,522
What are we paying you for?

192
00:39:46,689 --> 00:39:52,195
The protection I provide is from the
police. You complain to me.

193
00:39:52,361 --> 00:39:56,824
If you two can't handle
your own shit on the street-

194
00:39:56,991 --> 00:40:00,578
- I'll find somebody who can.

195
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:04,832
From this day forth, you are in
partnership with Mr. Hong.

196
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:07,293
Split three ways.

197
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:14,258
- It's not your call, Mr. V!
- Everything in St. Jude is my call.

198
00:40:14,425 --> 00:40:17,762
What the fuck, this is bullshit!

199
00:40:19,388 --> 00:40:21,224
Oh, take it easy.

200
00:40:28,106 --> 00:40:32,860
There's a saying from the people
where I come from.

201
00:40:33,027 --> 00:40:36,948
Fritto il pesce, aperti cosce,
tutto va bene.

202
00:40:37,115 --> 00:40:43,413
It means: Fried fish. Open thighs.
Everything's fine.

203
00:40:44,705 --> 00:40:47,417
You work with Hong.

204
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:12,794
- What do you have against Hong?
- Nobody knows who he is.

205
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:17,715
Or where he came from.

206
00:42:17,882 --> 00:42:19,967
Does it matter?

207
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:24,388
I don't trust anything
that's too good to be true.

208
00:42:28,434 --> 00:42:34,607
Do you know what
SIuder's Syndrome is?

209
00:42:34,774 --> 00:42:38,361
It's when a person with a chronic
disease is cured.

210
00:42:38,528 --> 00:42:42,657
And they missed the disease.

211
00:42:42,824 --> 00:42:46,160
Because they don't know
how to live without it.

212
00:43:28,244 --> 00:43:35,585
Mr. Lord, you're looking fit. I wish
you hadn't chosen this shithole.

213
00:43:35,752 --> 00:43:41,674
Apologize. I hear you have
problem in St. Jude.

214
00:43:41,841 --> 00:43:47,513
- You're hard of hearing.
- Devil Dogs can take care of ninja.

215
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,725
The one who give you the problem.

216
00:43:50,892 --> 00:43:54,771
Problems? Mr. Lord, we've got no
problems in St. Jude.

217
00:43:54,937 --> 00:43:58,524
Matter of fact, in St. Jude,
we have no problem.

218
00:43:58,691 --> 00:44:05,073
The kids are swinging and the roses
are growing in the town square.

219
00:44:05,239 --> 00:44:09,535
I got no business with you.
You got no business in St. Jude.

220
00:44:09,702 --> 00:44:13,831
Okay, bro. Whatever you say.

221
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:18,211
Alright, bro.

222
00:44:40,441 --> 00:44:43,736
It is because he did not understand.

223
00:44:47,031 --> 00:44:53,871
Bang. Don't think about the gun.
Think about the man.

224
00:45:28,865 --> 00:45:31,951
Come in.

225
00:45:32,118 --> 00:45:35,246
Hey.

226
00:45:40,209 --> 00:45:45,631
The neighbors are just very happy.

227
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:50,052
Tell them I said "thank you".

228
00:45:52,013 --> 00:45:56,434
Fuck you!
Don't mess with the Devil Dogs.

229
00:45:58,144 --> 00:46:00,188
What the fuck?

230
00:46:07,987 --> 00:46:10,656
I'll fuck you up now.

231
00:46:48,694 --> 00:46:53,783
Three rules you live by.
One: don't harm civilians.

232
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:58,204
Two: no dealing to kids. Adults only.

233
00:46:58,371 --> 00:47:01,040
The price of a bag goes up by half.

234
00:47:01,207 --> 00:47:03,751
All transactions are pushed
to the borders.

235
00:47:03,918 --> 00:47:07,505
Three: no guns.
Only cowards use guns.

236
00:47:07,672 --> 00:47:12,343
- And the Devil Dogs.
- Shut up when the man is speaking.

237
00:47:13,428 --> 00:47:15,805
Understand?

238
00:47:15,972 --> 00:47:19,350
You heard him?

239
00:47:37,869 --> 00:47:42,165
- Is it too much to ask for a croissant?
- Perfetto.

240
00:47:42,331 --> 00:47:44,751
Mr. V!

241
00:47:48,921 --> 00:47:52,800
- Sgt. Howe here is very very upset.
- So?

242
00:47:52,967 --> 00:47:59,182
So? So. What's all this
about a "new way"?

243
00:47:59,348 --> 00:48:02,643
- What do you mean, "new way"?
- Let him finish.

244
00:48:02,810 --> 00:48:06,439
Disarming your men.
Are you fucking nuts?

245
00:48:06,606 --> 00:48:10,985
It's too damned close
to the Devil Dog territory.

246
00:48:11,152 --> 00:48:14,405
They can't afford the prices,
but are buying anyway..

247
00:48:14,572 --> 00:48:19,118
That's just bad business.

248
00:48:20,578 --> 00:48:24,457
- The floor is open.
- If I may...

249
00:48:24,624 --> 00:48:29,504
The people of St. Jude feel safer.

250
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:33,091
They say we cleaned it up.

251
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:35,510
Is that what they say?

252
00:48:35,676 --> 00:48:42,391
It seems to me the police force
should be keeping the people safe.

253
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:46,604
Sol have an idea. You do your job
and you do your job.

254
00:48:46,771 --> 00:48:51,818
And don't come here telling other
people how to do theirs.

255
00:48:53,319 --> 00:48:56,280
Capito.

256
00:48:58,866 --> 00:49:01,953
I say let's eat.

257
00:50:43,513 --> 00:50:45,556
Come to Papa.

258
00:51:32,478 --> 00:51:35,106
Fuck!

259
00:51:47,326 --> 00:51:53,249
Howe. Stop whatever you're doing
with that bitch and call me now.

260
00:51:56,210 --> 00:52:00,339
Call me. I don't know where you are,
but get to your phone.

261
00:52:00,506 --> 00:52:02,675
Dial my number, call me.

262
00:52:02,842 --> 00:52:06,220
Something is missing.
I think you know what it is.

263
00:52:06,387 --> 00:52:12,435
So get to the phone and
call me now. Got it?

264
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:18,858
Fuck!

265
00:52:22,153 --> 00:52:26,199
Where's Feldman?

266
00:52:26,365 --> 00:52:29,827
Yes, it's Mr. V,
now where's Feldman?

267
00:52:29,994 --> 00:52:33,539
- What would I want with him?
- I don't know.

268
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:41,172
There's something happening. I don't
know what it is. Stay by your phone.

269
00:52:56,312 --> 00:52:59,273
Feldman!

270
00:53:12,703 --> 00:53:16,833
- You're so fucking hot.
- Shut up, pig.

271
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:24,757
I'm naughty.

272
00:53:24,924 --> 00:53:28,678
You slut, you can do better than
that, bitch. Come on.

273
00:53:32,056 --> 00:53:35,226
Shut the fuck up.

274
00:53:37,145 --> 00:53:39,731
- What the fuck?
- Where's my money?

275
00:53:39,897 --> 00:53:43,067
I don't know. Watch what
you're doing, man.

276
00:53:43,234 --> 00:53:47,280
- Step aside.
- What the fuck?

277
00:53:47,447 --> 00:53:51,200
- Come on, man.
- Wear this. Let me show you how.

278
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:55,663
- Where's my money?
- I don't know what the...

279
00:53:55,830 --> 00:54:00,293
You and Feldman know where the
money was. Where's Feldman?

280
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:04,255
- I don't know.
- Hold your fist like this.

281
00:54:04,422 --> 00:54:10,970
- Are you learning something here?
- Yes, sir.

282
00:54:11,137 --> 00:54:15,725
- Take one. Spin that.
- I don't know where Feldman is.

283
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:19,854
I swear to God, I'm not that stupid.

284
00:54:20,021 --> 00:54:25,026
- Lay off the croissants, Howe.
- Please, please. Come on!

285
00:54:25,193 --> 00:54:29,405
- I'm going to shoot your weewee.
- Please, I swear to God.

286
00:54:29,572 --> 00:54:33,076
- Where's Feldman?
- Please, I don't...

287
00:54:33,242 --> 00:54:37,497
Ready? Oh, that was one.

288
00:54:37,663 --> 00:54:42,835
- Here's two. No.
- I didn't. I didn't.

289
00:54:43,002 --> 00:54:48,841
- Where's Feldman? Here's three.
- Please, you're making a mistake.

290
00:54:49,008 --> 00:54:53,471
- No!
- Say goodbye to weewee. Click.

291
00:54:53,638 --> 00:54:57,850
- Here comes four.
- No!

292
00:54:59,685 --> 00:55:04,107
Shut up.

293
00:55:07,944 --> 00:55:10,530
Alright.

294
00:55:10,696 --> 00:55:15,326
This is a mistake. Please don't.
No, God, boss.

295
00:55:20,331 --> 00:55:25,211
Hang up your makeup, fat boy.
We've got work to do.

296
00:55:25,378 --> 00:55:28,464
Thank you, doll.

297
00:55:40,935 --> 00:55:44,439
Mr. V wants to see you.

298
00:55:44,605 --> 00:55:48,025
Come on, Hong, don't bust my balls.

299
00:55:48,192 --> 00:55:54,323
- What's going on?
- I don't know, he don't tell me shit.

300
00:55:55,158 --> 00:56:00,413
Feldman ripped him off. Now he don't
trust no one but you.

301
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:04,000
Maybe he wants you to kill him.

302
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,885
Get in the car. Please.
It's been a long day.

303
00:56:43,081 --> 00:56:45,833
Here we are.

304
00:56:48,086 --> 00:56:53,508
Mr. V's right over here. I'm getting
hungry, you want a sandwich?

305
00:57:00,973 --> 00:57:02,308
Yeah.

306
00:57:20,701 --> 00:57:23,830
Hey, there he is.

307
00:57:26,207 --> 00:57:29,335
You sleep okay?

308
00:57:29,502 --> 00:57:32,422
You got a phone call.

309
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:40,096
I'm disappointed, Hong. I thought you
were a man I could trust.

310
00:57:40,263 --> 00:57:42,557
I was mistaken.

311
00:57:42,723 --> 00:57:48,521
You didn't deliver on
a single favor I asked you.

312
00:57:56,821 --> 00:58:00,283
You know this guy? Hey, asshole!

313
00:58:02,452 --> 00:58:08,040
- Is this the guy who killed you?
- I don't know him!

314
00:58:08,207 --> 00:58:10,793
Let me talk, please!

315
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,174
Oops.

316
00:58:18,384 --> 00:58:20,386
Here.

317
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:26,684
Officer Fizar.

318
00:58:26,851 --> 00:58:31,314
I'd like you to meet Mr. Hong.

319
00:58:33,066 --> 00:58:36,110
Hello, Mr. Hong,
it's nice to meet you.

320
00:59:06,099 --> 00:59:08,684
Hard head, right?

321
01:00:55,666 --> 01:01:02,423
Here's your phone.
Keep it in your pocket next time.

322
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:08,346
Let's get these guys in a box.

323
01:01:31,953 --> 01:01:36,707
Mr. V? Feldman. Yeah, we got him.

324
01:01:41,129 --> 01:01:43,131
Did you put a bullet in his brain?

325
01:01:44,882 --> 01:01:48,177
I'm sorry?

326
01:01:48,344 --> 01:01:55,143
Feldman, tell me
you put a bullet in his brain.

327
01:01:55,309 --> 01:02:00,898
- Mr. V, he's dead, no question.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

328
01:02:01,899 --> 01:02:07,113
You stay where you are.
I'm coming down there.

329
01:02:27,425 --> 01:02:31,095
-It's been a good day.
- Where is he?

330
01:02:31,262 --> 01:02:35,558
Where's his head? Here?

331
01:02:41,397 --> 01:02:43,316
Open it.

332
01:02:50,698 --> 01:02:53,034
Shit!

333
01:02:55,161 --> 01:03:02,668
No, no, no! Howe, come on.
Mr. V, the guy put him in the box.

334
01:03:03,795 --> 01:03:06,923
We got him. Mr. V, we got him.

335
01:03:09,717 --> 01:03:12,470
No, you didn't.

336
01:05:15,718 --> 01:05:19,097
What you guys want?

337
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:23,976
Motherfuckers got business here?

338
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:59,971
- You're trying my patience, Mr. Lord.
- It's what I do.

339
01:06:09,689 --> 01:06:13,067
You don't have to try any longer.

340
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:25,872
- What about the ninja?
- He's gone.

341
01:06:26,038 --> 01:06:28,374
Do we have a deal?

342
01:06:35,298 --> 01:06:38,259
We have deal, bro.

343
01:06:39,635 --> 01:06:41,554
Yes, bro.

344
01:06:49,812 --> 01:06:52,440
You're the man now.

345
01:07:46,744 --> 01:07:49,747
You think your life is over?

346
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:57,839
- I killed her.
- And there's no changing that.

347
01:07:58,965 --> 01:08:02,677
But that doesn't mean
you should also die.

348
01:08:11,686 --> 01:08:15,231
I made a mistake once in a
moment of fury.

349
01:08:18,401 --> 01:08:21,904
I killed my own son.

350
01:10:31,617 --> 01:10:39,417
On that first day, in the yard,
I thought of my son.

351
01:10:39,584 --> 01:10:43,337
They say my rage is inside of you.

352
01:10:45,882 --> 01:10:49,886
I will never forgive myself.

353
01:10:50,052 --> 01:10:52,430
Neven

354
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:58,603
But I must still
do good in this world.

355
01:10:58,770 --> 01:11:02,023
And so should you.

356
01:11:03,066 --> 01:11:08,488
You have the dragon eyes.
The spirit of the grand masters.

357
01:11:09,906 --> 01:11:13,910
But you have strayed from your path.

358
01:11:19,665 --> 01:11:24,629
When you get out, there is
something I need you to do for me.

359
01:11:27,006 --> 01:11:33,513
There is a town called St. Jude.
A town that has fallen into darkness.

360
01:11:34,889 --> 01:11:38,267
You must go there.

361
01:13:01,893 --> 01:13:05,772
Okay, Hong. Wherever you are.

362
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:19,744
Back in Da Nang, there was guy
in the platoon... Coakley.

363
01:13:23,081 --> 01:13:26,751
We didn't pay much attention to him.

364
01:13:26,918 --> 01:13:32,799
And one day we got ambushed.
Six of us pinned down in heavy fire.

365
01:13:32,965 --> 01:13:39,514
Then... a VietCong hand grenade
drops in to finish us off.

366
01:13:41,057 --> 01:13:47,522
We were six sitting ducks,
everyone kissing their ass goodbye.

367
01:13:47,688 --> 01:13:50,817
Except Coakley.

368
01:13:50,983 --> 01:13:57,281
He goes gung-ho, dives on it
and covers it up with his helmet.

369
01:13:57,448 --> 01:13:59,867
And then boom.

370
01:14:02,412 --> 01:14:05,123
Not a scratch.

371
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:08,418
Damndest thing I ever saw.

372
01:14:08,584 --> 01:14:14,215
Platoon got so inspired,
we jumped up and started firing.

373
01:14:17,218 --> 01:14:21,305
Standing there in the wide open,
fighting back.

374
01:14:23,182 --> 01:14:25,643
Fighting back.

375
01:14:26,853 --> 01:14:32,150
In that moment, we were invincible.

376
01:14:36,988 --> 01:14:41,993
I know who you are. You're Coakley.

377
01:14:44,412 --> 01:14:49,208
- I'm not Coakley.
- Yeah, well. I'm not Tiano.

378
01:14:52,128 --> 01:14:55,214
You kept calling me that last night.

379
01:14:56,174 --> 01:14:59,260
I haven't heard that name in a while.

380
01:15:00,303 --> 01:15:04,640
Your car, that's his ride.

381
01:15:06,309 --> 01:15:08,770
Right?

382
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:17,904
He was from St. Jude. The only one
that could stand up to the gangs.

383
01:15:23,159 --> 01:15:26,621
Nothing's been the same since he
went away.

384
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:48,471
Who is this guy? Word on the street
is he's a fucking ghost.

385
01:17:48,638 --> 01:17:52,683
Word on the street,
this is your job, to find the ghost.

386
01:17:52,850 --> 01:17:56,521
I know you'll take care of it,
move out of the way.

387
01:17:58,815 --> 01:18:00,858
Mira esta!

388
01:18:06,572 --> 01:18:11,494
Make money instead of losing money.
Your bro just lost his damn money.

389
01:18:11,661 --> 01:18:15,415
Whose Timex watch is this?
I don't take Timex.

390
01:18:19,544 --> 01:18:24,132
- We were just talking about you.
- I heard.

391
01:18:51,325 --> 01:18:55,079
- What the fuck!
- I decide when you breathe. Understand?

392
01:18:55,246 --> 01:18:58,458
Goto hell!

393
01:18:58,624 --> 01:19:01,919
Call Mr. V.
Tell him we want to meet.

394
01:19:02,086 --> 01:19:05,006
What? Who the fuck
do you think you are?

395
01:19:07,925 --> 01:19:10,970
Okay, stop. Stop, stop!
Alright.

396
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:16,559
- Call him.
- Okay. Just loosen your grip.

397
01:19:28,988 --> 01:19:32,784
Mr. V? Seargent Feldman.

398
01:24:25,785 --> 01:24:29,622
Lazarus, risen from the grave.

399
01:24:29,789 --> 01:24:33,334
Albeit it a little bloody.

400
01:24:36,754 --> 01:24:39,090
Where's my money, Hong?

401
01:24:40,466 --> 01:24:43,302
I got your money.

402
01:24:44,554 --> 01:24:49,434
- Where is it?
- You'll leave St. Jude?

403
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,895
Then I'll give you your money.

404
01:24:58,276 --> 01:24:59,944
I capito.

405
01:25:01,446 --> 01:25:04,365
Better go now.

406
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:39,233
Where's my money?

407
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,992
Or what?

408
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:50,870
You're going to shoot me with that?

409
01:27:47,820 --> 01:27:51,240
