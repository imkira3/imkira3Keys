1
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,812
Lumos Maxima.

2
00:00:39,106 --> 00:00:41,858
Lumos Maxima.

3
00:01:01,962 --> 00:01:03,589
Lumos Maxima.

4
00:01:05,841 --> 00:01:07,759
Lumos Maxima.

5
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,638
Lumos Maxima!

6
00:01:14,558 --> 00:01:17,728
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban

7
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:42,628
Harry. Harry.

8
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:44,796
Harry, open the door.

9
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,014
Marge. How lovely to see...

10
00:01:54,223 --> 00:01:57,601
Uncle Vernon,
I need you to sign this form.

11
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,102
What is it?

12
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,396
Nothing. School stuff.

13
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:04,233
Later perhaps, if you behave.

14
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,610
I will if she does.

15
00:02:06,777 --> 00:02:09,905
- Oh, you're still here, are you?
- Yes.

16
00:02:10,322 --> 00:02:12,950
Don't say yes
in that ungrateful way.

17
00:02:13,116 --> 00:02:15,077
Damn good of my brother
to keep you.

18
00:02:15,244 --> 00:02:19,581
He'd have been straight to an orphanage
if he'd been dumped on my doorstep.

19
00:02:19,748 --> 00:02:24,127
Is that my Dudders?
Is that my little neffy-pooh?

20
00:02:24,294 --> 00:02:26,088
Give us a kiss. Come on. Up, up.

21
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:28,549
Take Marge's suitcase upstairs.

22
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,676
Okay.

23
00:02:34,054 --> 00:02:36,932
Finish that off for Mommy.
Good boy, Rippy-pooh.

24
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:40,894
- Can I tempt you, Marge?
- Just a small one.

25
00:02:41,103 --> 00:02:44,064
Excellent nosh, Petunia.

26
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:46,650
A bit more.

27
00:02:47,192 --> 00:02:50,487
Usually just a fry-up for me,
what with 12 dogs.

28
00:02:50,696 --> 00:02:53,282
Just a bit more. That's a boy.

29
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,370
You wanna try
a little drop of brandy?

30
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:02,583
A little drop of brandy-brandy
windy-wandy for Rippy-pippy-pooh?

31
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,878
What are you smirking at?

32
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,880
Where did you send the boy,
Vernon?

33
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:11,383
St. Brutus'. It's a fine
institution for hopeless cases.

34
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:14,553
Do they use a cane
at St. Brutus', boy?

35
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:19,349
Oh, yeah.

36
00:03:19,558 --> 00:03:22,227
Yeah. I've been beaten loads of times.

37
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,980
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby...

38
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:28,317
...wishy-washy nonsense about
not beating people who deserve it.

39
00:03:28,483 --> 00:03:31,612
You mustn't blame yourself
about how this one turned out.

40
00:03:31,778 --> 00:03:35,699
It's all to do with blood.
Bad blood will out.

41
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:38,035
What is it the boy's father did,
Petunia?

42
00:03:38,202 --> 00:03:41,205
Nothing. He didn't work.
He was unemployed.

43
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:44,208
- And a drunk too, no doubt?
- That's a lie.

44
00:03:44,374 --> 00:03:46,919
- What did you say?
- My dad wasn't a drunk.

45
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:54,009
Don't worry. Don't fuss, Petunia.
I have a very firm grip.

46
00:03:54,176 --> 00:03:56,011
I think it's time you went to bed.

47
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:59,431
Quiet, Vernon. You, clean it up.

48
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:03,810
Actually, it's nothing to do
with the father.

49
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,773
It's all to do with the mother.
You see it all the time with dogs.

50
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,985
If something's wrong with the bitch,
then something's wrong with the pup.

51
00:04:12,194 --> 00:04:13,862
Shut up! Shut up!

52
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,619
Right.

53
00:04:20,786 --> 00:04:22,913
Let me tell you...

54
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:46,478
Vernon!

55
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:51,316
Vernon! Vernon, do something!

56
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:36,778
Stop!

57
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:41,909
I've got you, Marge. I've got you.

58
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,331
- Hold on, hold on.
- Get off.

59
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:50,417
- Don't you dare!
- Sorry.

60
00:05:51,627 --> 00:05:53,462
Oh, Vernon.

61
00:05:53,629 --> 00:05:55,380
Oh, God.

62
00:05:55,547 --> 00:05:57,341
Marge!

63
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:06,600
Please!

64
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:09,436
Marge!

65
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,690
Come back!

66
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:40,092
You bring her back!
You bring her back now.

67
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,512
- You put her right!
- No. She deserved what she got.

68
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:47,099
- Keep away from me.
- You can't do magic outside school.

69
00:06:47,307 --> 00:06:50,310
- Yeah? Try me.
- They won't let you back now.

70
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:51,812
You've nowhere to go.

71
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:54,314
I don't care.
Anywhere is better than here.

72
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:32,287
"Welcome to the Knight Bus...

73
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:35,832
...emergency transport
for the stranded witch or wizard.

74
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:40,963
My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor for this evening. "

75
00:08:44,716 --> 00:08:46,134
What you doing down there?

76
00:08:46,885 --> 00:08:49,054
- I fell over.
- What you fall over for?

77
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:51,932
- I didn't do it on purpose.
- Well, come on, then.

78
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,309
Let's not wait for the grass to grow.

79
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,486
- What you looking at?
- Nothing.

80
00:09:04,653 --> 00:09:06,405
Well, come on, then. In.

81
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:09,408
No, no, no. I'll get this.
You get in.

82
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:16,582
Come on.

83
00:09:26,466 --> 00:09:29,219
Come on. Move on, move on.

84
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:47,237
- Take her away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie.

85
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,656
It's going to be a bumpy ride.

86
00:10:00,334 --> 00:10:03,629
- What did you say your name was?
- I didn't.

87
00:10:04,213 --> 00:10:08,300
- Whereabouts are you headed?
- The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.

88
00:10:08,508 --> 00:10:11,428
You hear that? "The Leaky Cauldron.
That's in London. "

89
00:10:11,595 --> 00:10:13,931
The Leaky Cauldron.
If you have pea soup...

90
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,892
...make sure you eat it
before it eats you.

91
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:22,940
- But the Muggles. Can't they see us?
- Muggles?

92
00:10:23,106 --> 00:10:24,858
They don't see nothing, do they?

93
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:27,569
No, but if you jab them
with a fork, they feel.

94
00:10:29,321 --> 00:10:32,366
Ernie, little old lady at 12 o'clock!

95
00:10:41,124 --> 00:10:43,669
Ten, nine, eight...

96
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:46,588
...seven, six, five...

97
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:49,049
...four, three, three and a half...

98
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:51,051
...two, one and three quarters.

99
00:10:51,593 --> 00:10:53,220
Yes!

100
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,934
Who is that?

101
00:10:59,142 --> 00:11:01,520
That man.

102
00:11:03,188 --> 00:11:04,982
Who is that?

103
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,692
Who is...?

104
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,278
That is Sirius Black, that is.

105
00:11:09,862 --> 00:11:13,115
Don't tell me you've never
been hearing of Sirius Black.

106
00:11:14,408 --> 00:11:16,702
He's a murderer.

107
00:11:16,869 --> 00:11:19,496
Got himself locked up
in Azkaban for it.

108
00:11:20,163 --> 00:11:23,584
- How did he escape?
- Well, that's the question, isn't it?

109
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,711
He's the first one that done it.

110
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,298
He was a big supporter of...

111
00:11:29,798 --> 00:11:31,300
...You-Know-Who.

112
00:11:32,009 --> 00:11:33,886
I reckon you've heard of him.

113
00:11:34,052 --> 00:11:35,637
Yeah.

114
00:11:35,804 --> 00:11:37,139
Him I've heard of.

115
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:42,477
Ernie, two double-deckers
at 12 o'clock.

116
00:11:42,978 --> 00:11:44,646
They're getting closer, Ernie.

117
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:47,691
Ernie, they're right on top of us!

118
00:11:55,073 --> 00:11:57,492
Mind your head.

119
00:12:02,372 --> 00:12:04,333
Hey, guys? Guys?

120
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,710
Why the long faces?

121
00:12:12,549 --> 00:12:14,968
Yeah, yeah. Nearly there. Nearly there.

122
00:12:20,432 --> 00:12:23,810
- The Leaky Cauldron.
- Next stop, Knockturn Alley.

123
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,814
Mr. Potter, at last.

124
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,529
- Take it away, Ern.
- Yeah, take it away, Ernie!

125
00:12:56,718 --> 00:12:58,554
Room 11.

126
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,474
Hedwig.

127
00:13:02,641 --> 00:13:05,477
Right smart bird
you got there, Mr. Potter.

128
00:13:05,644 --> 00:13:09,356
He arrived here just
five minutes before yourself.

129
00:13:11,275 --> 00:13:14,903
As Minister for Magic, it is my duty
to inform you, Mr. Potter...

130
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,282
...earlier this evening
your uncle's sister was located...

131
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:22,411
...a little south of Sheffield,
circling a chimney stack.

132
00:13:22,578 --> 00:13:26,331
The Accidental Magic Reversal
Department was dispatched immediately.

133
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:31,295
She has been properly punctured
and her memory modified.

134
00:13:31,503 --> 00:13:36,174
She will have no recollection
of the incident whatsoever.

135
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:38,927
So that's that...

136
00:13:39,094 --> 00:13:41,972
...and no harm done.

137
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,974
Pea soup?

138
00:13:44,141 --> 00:13:46,268
No, thank you.

139
00:13:46,435 --> 00:13:48,645
- Minister?
- Yes?

140
00:13:48,812 --> 00:13:50,564
- I don't understand.
- Understand?

141
00:13:50,772 --> 00:13:54,318
I broke the law. Underage wizards
can't use magic at home.

142
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:57,529
Come now. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban...

143
00:13:57,696 --> 00:14:00,240
...for blowing up their aunts.

144
00:14:04,203 --> 00:14:08,749
On the other hand, running away
like that, given the state of things...

145
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,376
...was very, very irresponsible.

146
00:14:11,585 --> 00:14:15,380
- "The state of things," sir?
- We have a killer on the loose.

147
00:14:15,547 --> 00:14:17,382
Sirius Black, you mean?

148
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:19,301
But what's he got to do with me?

149
00:14:21,595 --> 00:14:26,433
Nothing, of course. You're safe.
And that's what matters.

150
00:14:26,642 --> 00:14:29,770
And tomorrow you'll be
on your way back to Hogwarts.

151
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:32,898
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty...

152
00:14:33,065 --> 00:14:37,069
...of having them brought here.
Now Tom will show you to your room.

153
00:14:41,865 --> 00:14:43,200
Hedwig.

154
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:48,455
Oh, by the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here, it would be best if you didn't...

155
00:14:48,747 --> 00:14:51,208
...wander.

156
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:55,671
Right! You gonna move
that bus or what?

157
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,501
Housekeeping.

158
00:16:19,922 --> 00:16:22,174
I'll come back later.

159
00:16:29,765 --> 00:16:31,183
I'm warning you, Hermione.

160
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,062
Keep that beast away from Scabbers,
or I'll turn it into a tea cozy.

161
00:16:35,229 --> 00:16:37,314
It's a cat, Ronald.
What do you expect?

162
00:16:37,481 --> 00:16:40,484
- It's in his nature.
- A cat? Is that what they told you?

163
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:43,195
- Looks like a pig with hair.
- That's rich...

164
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:45,906
...coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.

165
00:16:46,073 --> 00:16:48,492
Crookshanks, just ignore
the mean little boy.

166
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,285
Harry.

167
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,788
Harry.

168
00:16:53,956 --> 00:16:57,042
- Egypt. What's it like?
- Brilliant. Loads of old stuff...

169
00:16:57,251 --> 00:17:00,587
...like mummies, tombs,
even Scabbers enjoyed himself.

170
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:03,966
- Egyptians used to worship cats.
- Along with the dung beetle.

171
00:17:04,132 --> 00:17:07,302
- Not flashing that clipping again?
- I haven't shown anyone.

172
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:09,888
No, not a soul.
Not unless you count Tom.

173
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:11,473
- The day maid.
- Night maid.

174
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,767
- Cook.
- The bloke who fixed the toilet.

175
00:17:13,934 --> 00:17:15,352
- Harry.
- Mrs. Weasley.

176
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,688
- Good to see you, dear.
- Good to see you.

177
00:17:17,855 --> 00:17:19,189
- Got everything?
- Yes.

178
00:17:19,356 --> 00:17:21,525
- Yes? All your books?
- It's all upstairs.

179
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:23,110
- Your clothes?
- Everything.

180
00:17:23,277 --> 00:17:24,695
- Good boy.
- Thank you.

181
00:17:24,862 --> 00:17:26,738
- Harry Potter.
- Mr. Weasley.

182
00:17:26,905 --> 00:17:30,409
- Harry, wonder if I might have a word?
- Yeah, sure.

183
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:33,245
- Hermione.
- Good morning, Mr. Weasley.

184
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:37,040
- Looking forward to a new term?
- Yeah. It should be great.

185
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:43,964
Harry, some within the Ministry
would strongly discourage me...

186
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,800
...from divulging what I'm about
to reveal to you.

187
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:50,304
But I think that you need
to know the facts.

188
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,056
You are in danger.

189
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:56,184
Grave danger.

190
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:59,313
Has this anything to do
with Sirius Black, sir?

191
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:02,524
What do you know
about Sirius Black, Harry?

192
00:18:02,691 --> 00:18:06,403
- Only that he's escaped from Azkaban.
- Do you know why?

193
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:09,907
Thirteen years ago,
when you stopped...

194
00:18:10,073 --> 00:18:11,909
- Voldemort.
- Don't say his name.

195
00:18:12,075 --> 00:18:13,410
Sorry.

196
00:18:13,577 --> 00:18:16,496
When you stopped You-Know-Who...

197
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,290
...Black lost everything.

198
00:18:18,457 --> 00:18:22,753
But to this day, he still remains
a faithful servant.

199
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,088
And in his mind...

200
00:18:25,255 --> 00:18:28,258
...you are the only thing
that stands in the way...

201
00:18:28,425 --> 00:18:32,179
...of You-Know-Who
returning to power.

202
00:18:32,346 --> 00:18:34,514
And that is why...

203
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,226
...he has escaped from Azkaban.

204
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,269
To find you.

205
00:18:40,729 --> 00:18:42,356
And kill me.

206
00:18:43,315 --> 00:18:45,984
Harry, swear to me
that whatever you might hear...

207
00:18:46,151 --> 00:18:48,695
...you won't go looking for Black.

208
00:18:49,071 --> 00:18:50,405
Mr. Weasley...

209
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:54,576
...why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?

210
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:56,995
Quick. Quick.

211
00:18:57,287 --> 00:18:59,122
Ron, Ron!

212
00:18:59,831 --> 00:19:01,917
Oh, for goodness' sake!

213
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,586
Don't lose him!

214
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:07,714
I didn't mean to blow her up. I just...

215
00:19:07,881 --> 00:19:10,342
- I lost control.
- Brilliant.

216
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:14,096
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry was lucky not to be expelled.

217
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:16,014
I was lucky not to be arrested.

218
00:19:16,181 --> 00:19:18,225
I still think it was brilliant.

219
00:19:18,809 --> 00:19:21,144
Come on. Everywhere else is full.

220
00:19:23,981 --> 00:19:25,357
Who do you think that is?

221
00:19:25,524 --> 00:19:28,402
- Professor R.J. Lupin.
- Do you know everything?

222
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:30,696
How is it she knows everything?

223
00:19:30,863 --> 00:19:33,991
- It's on his suitcase, Ronald.
- Oh.

224
00:19:34,283 --> 00:19:37,578
- Do you think he's really asleep?
- Seems to be. Why?

225
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:41,415
I gotta tell you something.

226
00:19:54,636 --> 00:19:57,973
Let me get this straight.
Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban...

227
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,975
...to come after you?
- Yeah.

228
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:02,144
But they'll catch Black, won't they?

229
00:20:02,311 --> 00:20:05,022
- I mean, everyone's looking for him.
- Sure.

230
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:08,525
Except no one's ever broken out
of Azkaban before...

231
00:20:08,692 --> 00:20:12,696
...and he's a murderous, raving lunatic.
- Thanks, Ron.

232
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:15,782
Why are we stopping?

233
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,577
We can't be there yet.

234
00:20:22,831 --> 00:20:25,042
What's going on?

235
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,920
I don't know.
Maybe we've broken down.

236
00:20:29,838 --> 00:20:32,174
Ouch, Ron. That was my foot.

237
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,968
There's something moving out there.

238
00:20:48,565 --> 00:20:51,610
I think someone's coming aboard.

239
00:21:16,802 --> 00:21:19,680
Bloody hell! What's happening?

240
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,378
Harry.

241
00:22:34,463 --> 00:22:36,298
Harry, are you all right?

242
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:44,139
Thank you.

243
00:22:45,307 --> 00:22:47,768
Here, eat this. It'll help.

244
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,395
It's all right. It's chocolate.

245
00:22:56,693 --> 00:22:58,779
What was that thing that came?

246
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:02,366
It was a dementor. One of the guards
of Azkaban. It's gone now.

247
00:23:02,533 --> 00:23:05,244
It was searching the train
for Sirius Black.

248
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:09,039
If you'll excuse me, I need to have
a little word with the driver.

249
00:23:13,627 --> 00:23:16,547
Eat. You'll feel better.

250
00:23:22,344 --> 00:23:23,679
What happened to me?

251
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:25,597
Well, you sort of went rigid.

252
00:23:25,764 --> 00:23:28,934
We thought maybe you were
having a fit or something.

253
00:23:30,686 --> 00:23:32,479
And did either of you two...

254
00:23:32,646 --> 00:23:33,981
...you know...

255
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:37,234
...pass out?
- No.

256
00:23:37,401 --> 00:23:39,111
I felt weird, though.

257
00:23:39,278 --> 00:23:41,113
Like I'd never be cheerful again.

258
00:23:42,364 --> 00:23:44,575
But someone was screaming.

259
00:23:44,741 --> 00:23:46,118
A woman.

260
00:23:47,077 --> 00:23:49,079
No one was screaming, Harry.

261
00:24:48,263 --> 00:24:52,017
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts.

262
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:54,269
Now, I'd like to say a few words...

263
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:58,774
...before we all become too befuddled
by our excellent feast.

264
00:24:58,941 --> 00:25:02,194
First, I'm pleased to welcome
Professor R.J. Lupin...

265
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:04,821
...who's kindly consented
to fill the post...

266
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,491
...of Defense Against
the Dark Arts teacher.

267
00:25:07,658 --> 00:25:10,202
Good luck, professor.

268
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,126
Of course. That's why he knew
to give you the chocolate, Harry.

269
00:25:18,293 --> 00:25:20,963
Potter. Is it true you fainted?

270
00:25:21,797 --> 00:25:24,800
- I mean, you actually fainted?
- Shove off, Malfoy.

271
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:26,969
- How did he find out?
- Just forget it.

272
00:25:27,135 --> 00:25:29,513
Our Care of Magical Creatures
teacher...

273
00:25:29,721 --> 00:25:31,598
...has decided to retire...

274
00:25:31,765 --> 00:25:35,519
...in order to spend more time
with his remaining limbs.

275
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:38,438
Fortunately,
I'm delighted to announce...

276
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:41,441
...that his place will be taken
by none other...

277
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:45,946
...than our own Rubeus Hagrid.

278
00:25:57,207 --> 00:26:00,002
Finally, on a more disquieting note...

279
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,713
...at the request
of the Ministry of Magic...

280
00:26:02,921 --> 00:26:08,093
...Hogwarts will, until further notice,
play host to the dementors of Azkaban...

281
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,222
...until such a time
as Sirius Black is captured.

282
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:16,852
The dementors will be stationed
at every entrance to the grounds.

283
00:26:17,019 --> 00:26:18,687
Now whilst I've been assured...

284
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:22,524
...that their presence will not disrupt
our day-to-day activities...

285
00:26:22,691 --> 00:26:24,026
...a word of caution.

286
00:26:24,234 --> 00:26:27,404
Dementors are vicious creatures.
They'll not distinguish...

287
00:26:27,571 --> 00:26:30,991
...between the one they hunt
and the one who gets in their way.

288
00:26:31,158 --> 00:26:34,786
Therefore, I must warn
each and every one of you...

289
00:26:34,953 --> 00:26:38,582
...to give them no reason
to harm you.

290
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:44,463
It is not in the nature
of a dementor to be forgiving.

291
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:49,885
But you know,
happiness can be found...

292
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:53,680
...even in the darkest of times...

293
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,769
...if one only remembers
to turn on the light.

294
00:27:10,781 --> 00:27:12,783
<i>Fortuna Major.</i>

295
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:18,288
Here, listen.
She just won't let me in.

296
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:21,416
<i>- Fortuna Major.
- No, no. Wait, wait.</i>

297
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:23,418
Watch this.

298
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:39,142
<i>- Amazing. Just with my voice.
- Fortuna Major.</i>

299
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:42,896
- Yes, all right. Go in.
- Thank you.

300
00:27:44,898 --> 00:27:46,900
Still doing that after three years.

301
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:49,236
- She can't even sing.
- Exactly.

302
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:52,614
- Hey, man.
- Hey, man.

303
00:27:53,657 --> 00:27:55,033
- Oh, God.
- That's awful.

304
00:27:55,993 --> 00:27:58,161
Green. That's a monkey.

305
00:27:59,955 --> 00:28:02,624
- What is that?
- You call that a monkey?

306
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:05,002
Do not give him one again.

307
00:28:05,168 --> 00:28:07,796
Hey, Neville, try an elephant.

308
00:28:14,887 --> 00:28:16,638
- Ron, catch.
- I will.

309
00:28:22,311 --> 00:28:23,937
I think we have a winner.

310
00:28:24,897 --> 00:28:27,232
- Oh, don't try one of them.
- Oh, no.

311
00:28:27,858 --> 00:28:30,360
Look at him. His face.

312
00:29:13,987 --> 00:29:16,240
<i>Welcome, my children.</i>

313
00:29:16,448 --> 00:29:21,537
In this room, you shall explore
the noble art of Divination.

314
00:29:21,703 --> 00:29:27,000
In this room, you shall discover
if you possess the Sight.

315
00:29:28,418 --> 00:29:32,381
Hello. I am Professor Trelawney.

316
00:29:32,548 --> 00:29:37,177
Together we shall cast ourselves
into the future.

317
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:41,223
This term, we'll focus on Tasseomancy,
the art of reading tea leaves.

318
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:44,977
So please, take the cup
of the person sitting opposite you.

319
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:46,854
What do you see?

320
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:52,693
The truth lies buried like a sentence
deep within a book, waiting to be read.

321
00:29:52,901 --> 00:29:55,320
But first, you must broaden
your minds.

322
00:29:55,487 --> 00:30:00,033
- First, you must look beyond.
- What a load of rubbish.

323
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,119
- Where did you come from?
- Me?

324
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:04,955
- I've been here all this time.
- You, boy...

325
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:07,416
Is your grandmother quite well?

326
00:30:08,083 --> 00:30:09,543
I think so.

327
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:12,504
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
Give me the cup.

328
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:16,884
Pity.

329
00:30:17,092 --> 00:30:19,720
Broaden your minds.

330
00:30:23,307 --> 00:30:26,643
Your aura is pulsing, dear.
Are you in the beyond?

331
00:30:26,810 --> 00:30:28,729
- I think you are.
- Sure.

332
00:30:28,937 --> 00:30:31,148
Look at the cup.
Tell me what you see.

333
00:30:31,315 --> 00:30:33,025
Yeah.

334
00:30:33,859 --> 00:30:38,280
Harry's got sort of a wonky cross.
That's trials and suffering.

335
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:42,367
And that there could be the sun
and that's happiness.

336
00:30:42,576 --> 00:30:43,911
So...

337
00:30:44,077 --> 00:30:48,123
...you're gonna suffer,
but you're gonna be happy about it.

338
00:30:48,332 --> 00:30:49,666
Give me the cup.

339
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:54,129
Oh, my dear boy.

340
00:30:56,215 --> 00:30:57,883
My dear...

341
00:30:59,551 --> 00:31:02,638
...you have the Grim.

342
00:31:03,472 --> 00:31:05,224
The Grin? What's the Grin?

343
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:08,268
Not the Grin, you idiot. The Grim.

344
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,604
"Taking form of a giant spectral dog.

345
00:31:10,812 --> 00:31:13,273
It's among the darkest omens
in our world.

346
00:31:13,815 --> 00:31:15,484
It's an omen...

347
00:31:15,651 --> 00:31:17,486
...of death. "

348
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:25,827
You don't think that Grim thing's
got anything to do with Sirius Black?

349
00:31:25,994 --> 00:31:29,957
Oh, honestly, Ron. If you ask me,
Divination's a woolly discipline.

350
00:31:30,123 --> 00:31:33,794
Now, Ancient Runes,
that's a fascinating subject.

351
00:31:33,961 --> 00:31:37,089
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking?

352
00:31:37,256 --> 00:31:38,924
A fair few.

353
00:31:39,091 --> 00:31:41,176
Hang on. That's not possible.

354
00:31:41,343 --> 00:31:44,137
Ancient Runes is in the
same time as Divination.

355
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:46,306
You have to be in two
classes at once.

356
00:31:46,473 --> 00:31:49,852
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?

357
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:54,273
"Broaden your minds. Use your
Inner Eye to see the future. "

358
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,403
That's it. Come on, now. Come closer.
Less talking, if you don't mind.

359
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:01,405
I got a real treat for you today.

360
00:32:01,572 --> 00:32:03,574
A great lesson. So follow me.

361
00:32:14,835 --> 00:32:17,921
Right, you lot. Less chattering.
Form a group over there.

362
00:32:18,088 --> 00:32:20,591
And open your books to page 49.

363
00:32:20,757 --> 00:32:22,384
Exactly how do we do that?

364
00:32:22,593 --> 00:32:26,471
Just stroke the spine, of course.
Goodness me.

365
00:32:35,856 --> 00:32:39,651
- Don't be such a wimp, Longbottom.
- I'm okay. Okay.

366
00:32:43,322 --> 00:32:46,533
- I think they're funny.
- Oh, yeah. Terribly funny.

367
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:49,203
Witty. God, this place
has gone to the dogs.

368
00:32:49,411 --> 00:32:53,081
Wait until Father hears Dumbledore's
got this oaf teaching classes.

369
00:32:54,041 --> 00:32:55,375
Shut up, Malfoy.

370
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:11,934
Dementor! Dementor!

371
00:33:19,942 --> 00:33:23,028
- Just ignore him.
- You're supposed to stroke it.

372
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:24,655
Yeah.

373
00:33:34,873 --> 00:33:37,876
Isn't he beautiful?

374
00:33:38,043 --> 00:33:40,671
Say hello to Buckbeak.

375
00:33:41,255 --> 00:33:43,507
Hagrid, exactly what is that?

376
00:33:43,715 --> 00:33:45,759
That, Ron, is a hippogriff.

377
00:33:45,926 --> 00:33:49,429
First thing you wanna know
is they're very proud creatures.

378
00:33:49,638 --> 00:33:53,517
Very easily offended.
You do not want to insult a hippogriff.

379
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:56,436
It may be the last thing you ever do.

380
00:33:56,603 --> 00:33:59,982
Now, who'd like to come
and say hello?

381
00:34:02,526 --> 00:34:04,611
Well done, Harry. Well done.

382
00:34:07,406 --> 00:34:08,782
Come on now.

383
00:34:09,324 --> 00:34:10,659
Now...

384
00:34:10,868 --> 00:34:14,580
...you have to let him make the first
move. It's only polite. So...

385
00:34:14,746 --> 00:34:16,623
...step up. Give him a nice bow.

386
00:34:16,832 --> 00:34:19,251
Then you wait
and see if he bows back.

387
00:34:19,418 --> 00:34:21,545
If he does, you can go and touch him.

388
00:34:21,712 --> 00:34:24,923
If not... Well,
we'll get to that later.

389
00:34:27,593 --> 00:34:29,636
Just make your bow.

390
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,890
Nice and low.

391
00:34:38,228 --> 00:34:39,897
Back off, Harry. Back off.

392
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:43,275
Keep still.

393
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:46,945
Keep still.

394
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:59,541
Well done, Harry. Well done.
Here, you big brute, you.

395
00:35:02,044 --> 00:35:04,588
Right. I think you can go
and pat him now.

396
00:35:04,796 --> 00:35:06,632
Go on. Don't be shy.

397
00:35:15,057 --> 00:35:17,518
Nice and slow, now.
Nice and slow. Slow.

398
00:35:20,854 --> 00:35:22,272
Not so fast, Harry.

399
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:30,614
Slow down, Harry. That's it...

400
00:35:30,822 --> 00:35:33,992
Nice and slow.
Now let him come to you.

401
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:38,205
Slowly, now, slowly, slowly...

402
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:40,207
That's it...

403
00:35:40,832 --> 00:35:42,167
Yes!

404
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:46,171
Well done! Well done, Harry,
well done!

405
00:35:46,338 --> 00:35:48,340
Does he get to fly?

406
00:35:48,549 --> 00:35:50,926
- I think he may let you ride him now.
- What?

407
00:35:51,134 --> 00:35:52,678
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey!

408
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:56,014
Put you over here,
just behind the wing joint.

409
00:35:56,682 --> 00:36:01,061
Don't pull out any of his feathers,
because he won't thank you for that.

410
00:37:41,995 --> 00:37:45,499
Well done, Harry, and well done,
Buckbeak.

411
00:37:45,707 --> 00:37:47,626
That was wicked, Harry!

412
00:37:47,834 --> 00:37:49,211
Oh, please.

413
00:37:50,003 --> 00:37:52,339
Well done, well done.

414
00:37:53,006 --> 00:37:56,218
- How am I doing me first day?
- Brilliant, professor.

415
00:37:59,638 --> 00:38:03,851
You're not dangerous at all, are you,
you great ugly brute!

416
00:38:04,059 --> 00:38:05,435
Malfoy, no...

417
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:07,813
No!

418
00:38:08,522 --> 00:38:10,148
Buckbeak!

419
00:38:10,357 --> 00:38:12,484
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

420
00:38:13,652 --> 00:38:15,445
Whoa! Buckbeak!

421
00:38:16,572 --> 00:38:18,907
Away, you silly creature...

422
00:38:19,116 --> 00:38:22,202
- It's killed me!
- Calm down. It's just a scratch!

423
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:23,620
Hagrid!

424
00:38:23,787 --> 00:38:29,001
- He has to be taken to the hospital.
- I'm the teacher. I'll do it.

425
00:38:32,045 --> 00:38:34,923
- You're gonna regret this.
- Class dismissed!

426
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:37,384
You and your bloody chicken!

427
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,910
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?

428
00:39:03,118 --> 00:39:06,955
It comes and it goes.
Still, I consider myself lucky.

429
00:39:07,122 --> 00:39:10,459
Madam Pomfrey said another minute
and I could've lost my arm.

430
00:39:10,792 --> 00:39:13,670
- I can't do homework for weeks.
- Listen to the idiot.

431
00:39:13,921 --> 00:39:18,175
- He's really laying it on thick, isn't he?
- At least Hagrid didn't get fired.

432
00:39:18,383 --> 00:39:22,095
I hear Draco's father's furious.
We haven't heard the end of this.

433
00:39:22,304 --> 00:39:24,139
- He's been sighted!
- Who?

434
00:39:24,348 --> 00:39:26,058
Sirius Black!

435
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,103
Dufftown? That's not far from here.

436
00:39:30,521 --> 00:39:33,148
You don't think he'd come
to Hogwarts, do you?

437
00:39:33,315 --> 00:39:35,817
- With dementors at every entrance?
- Dementors?

438
00:39:35,984 --> 00:39:39,321
He slipped past them once.
Who's to say he won't do it again?

439
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:44,076
That's right. Black could be anywhere.
It's like trying to catch smoke.

440
00:39:44,868 --> 00:39:48,038
Like trying to catch smoke
with your bare hands.

441
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:16,233
Intriguing, isn't it?

442
00:40:19,486 --> 00:40:22,239
Would anyone like to venture
a guess...

443
00:40:22,406 --> 00:40:24,199
...as to what is inside?

444
00:40:24,408 --> 00:40:28,412
- That's a boggart, that is.
- Very good, Mr. Thomas.

445
00:40:29,162 --> 00:40:32,082
Now, can anybody tell me
what a boggart looks like?

446
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,334
- No one knows.
- When did she get here?

447
00:40:34,543 --> 00:40:36,044
Boggarts are shape-shifters.

448
00:40:36,253 --> 00:40:39,464
They take the shape of whatever
a person fears the most.

449
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:44,094
- That's what makes them so...
- So terrifying, yes, yes, yes...

450
00:40:44,303 --> 00:40:49,766
Luckily, a very simple charm exists
to repel a boggart.

451
00:40:51,143 --> 00:40:54,897
Let's practice it now.
Without wands, please.

452
00:40:55,189 --> 00:40:57,691
<i>After me. Riddikulus!</i>

453
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,027
<i>- Riddikulus!
- Very good.</i>

454
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:02,738
A little louder and very clear.
Listen:

455
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:05,157
<i>- Riddikulus!
- Riddikulus!</i>

456
00:41:05,365 --> 00:41:07,451
- This class is ridiculous.
- Very good.

457
00:41:07,659 --> 00:41:11,663
So much for the easy part. You see,
the incantation alone is not enough.

458
00:41:11,872 --> 00:41:15,584
What really finishes a boggart
is laughter.

459
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:20,214
You need to force it to assume
a shape you find truly amusing.

460
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:24,509
Let me explain. Neville,
would you join me, please?

461
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:27,054
Come on, don't be shy. Come on.

462
00:41:28,055 --> 00:41:29,723
Come on.

463
00:41:30,182 --> 00:41:33,685
Hello. Neville, what frightens you
most of all?

464
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:35,562
Professor Snape.

465
00:41:35,771 --> 00:41:37,606
- Sorry?
- Professor Snape.

466
00:41:37,773 --> 00:41:41,193
Professor Snape. Yes, frightens all.

467
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,864
- You live with your grandmother.
- I don't want it to turn into her, either.

468
00:41:46,365 --> 00:41:47,950
No...

469
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:51,578
...it won't. I want you
to picture her clothes.

470
00:41:51,828 --> 00:41:55,040
Only her clothes, very clearly,
in your mind.

471
00:41:55,249 --> 00:41:58,335
- She carries a red handbag...
- We don't need to hear.

472
00:41:58,502 --> 00:42:02,381
As long as you see it, we'll see it.
Now, when I open that wardrobe...

473
00:42:02,589 --> 00:42:05,884
...here's what I want
you to do. Excuse me.

474
00:42:06,343 --> 00:42:09,263
Imagine Professor Snape
in your grandmother's clothes.

475
00:42:09,471 --> 00:42:11,181
Can you do that?

476
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:14,476
Yes. Wand at the ready.

477
00:42:14,810 --> 00:42:18,313
One, two, three.

478
00:42:28,115 --> 00:42:29,992
Think, Neville, think.

479
00:42:32,744 --> 00:42:34,788
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

480
00:42:39,334 --> 00:42:42,004
Wonderful, Neville, wonderful!
Incredible! Okay...

481
00:42:42,212 --> 00:42:45,132
...to the back, Neville.
Everyone, form a line...

482
00:42:51,346 --> 00:42:52,681
Form a line!

483
00:42:52,848 --> 00:42:56,268
I want everyone to picture the thing
they fear the very most...

484
00:42:56,476 --> 00:42:59,563
...and turn it into something funny.

485
00:42:59,771 --> 00:43:01,481
Next! Ron!

486
00:43:04,693 --> 00:43:08,238
Concentrate. Face your fear.
Be brave!

487
00:43:19,708 --> 00:43:21,251
Wand at the ready, Ron.

488
00:43:22,002 --> 00:43:23,837
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

489
00:43:24,004 --> 00:43:25,339
Yes!

490
00:43:25,964 --> 00:43:28,842
You see? Very good, very good!

491
00:43:29,343 --> 00:43:35,182
Marvelous! Absolutely, very, very
enjoyable! Parvati! Next!

492
00:43:36,975 --> 00:43:39,186
Show us what you see.

493
00:43:48,445 --> 00:43:51,865
Keep your nerve. Steady.

494
00:43:52,032 --> 00:43:53,992
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

495
00:43:55,035 --> 00:43:56,995
And next! Step up, step up!

496
00:43:58,080 --> 00:43:59,915
Wonderful, wonderful!

497
00:44:13,929 --> 00:44:16,056
Here!

498
00:44:21,895 --> 00:44:23,730
<i>Riddikulus!</i>

499
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,158
Right. Sorry about that.
That's enough for today.

500
00:44:35,325 --> 00:44:37,327
Collect your books from the back.

501
00:44:37,494 --> 00:44:40,122
That's the end of the lesson.
Thank you! Sorry!

502
00:44:40,289 --> 00:44:43,333
Sorry, you can have too much
of a good thing.

503
00:44:45,335 --> 00:44:49,923
Remember, these visits to Hogsmeade
village are a privilege.

504
00:44:50,215 --> 00:44:53,051
Should your behavior reflect poorly
on the school...

505
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:56,138
...that privilege shall not
be extended again.

506
00:44:56,597 --> 00:44:59,892
No permission form signed,
no visiting the village.

507
00:45:00,058 --> 00:45:01,602
That's the rule, Potter.

508
00:45:01,810 --> 00:45:05,022
Those with permission, follow me.
Those without, stay put.

509
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:07,691
I thought if you signed it,
then I could...

510
00:45:07,858 --> 00:45:10,360
I can't. Only a parent
or a guardian can sign.

511
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:13,739
Since I am neither,
it would be inappropriate.

512
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:20,621
I'm sorry, Potter.
That's my final word.

513
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:25,083
Forget about it, guys. See you later.

514
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:40,933
Professor, can I ask you something?

515
00:45:41,141 --> 00:45:44,978
You want to know why I stopped you
facing that boggart, yes?

516
00:45:45,187 --> 00:45:46,605
I thought it'd be obvious.

517
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:49,608
I assumed it would take the shape
of Lord Voldemort.

518
00:45:49,775 --> 00:45:53,278
I did think of Voldemort at first.

519
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:56,114
But then I remembered that night
on the train...

520
00:45:56,281 --> 00:45:58,825
...and the dementor.
- I'm very impressed.

521
00:45:58,992 --> 00:46:01,870
That suggests what you fear the most
is fear itself.

522
00:46:02,037 --> 00:46:03,539
This is very wise.

523
00:46:03,705 --> 00:46:05,791
Before I fainted...

524
00:46:06,041 --> 00:46:08,043
...I heard something.

525
00:46:08,585 --> 00:46:10,212
A woman...

526
00:46:10,671 --> 00:46:12,005
...screaming.

527
00:46:12,214 --> 00:46:15,467
Dementors force us to relive
our very worst memories.

528
00:46:15,676 --> 00:46:18,595
Our pain becomes their power.

529
00:46:19,429 --> 00:46:21,640
I think it was my mother...

530
00:46:21,807 --> 00:46:24,017
...the night she was murdered.

531
00:46:25,644 --> 00:46:30,107
The very first time I saw you, Harry,
I recognized you immediately.

532
00:46:30,691 --> 00:46:33,527
Not by your scar, by your eyes.

533
00:46:33,944 --> 00:46:36,113
They're your mother, Lily's.

534
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,490
Yes.

535
00:46:38,824 --> 00:46:41,827
Oh, yes. I knew her.

536
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:48,000
Your mother was there for me
at a time when no one else was.

537
00:46:48,208 --> 00:46:51,420
Not only was she
a singularly gifted witch...

538
00:46:51,587 --> 00:46:54,923
...she was also
an uncommonly kind woman.

539
00:46:55,424 --> 00:46:58,510
She had a way of seeing
the beauty in others...

540
00:46:58,677 --> 00:47:03,850
...even, and most especially, when that
person could not see it in themselves.

541
00:47:06,310 --> 00:47:09,021
And your father, James,
on the other hand...

542
00:47:09,188 --> 00:47:10,731
...he...

543
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:14,568
He had a certain, shall we say,
talent for trouble.

544
00:47:16,862 --> 00:47:22,367
A talent, rumor has it,
he passed on to you.

545
00:47:26,371 --> 00:47:29,333
You're more like them
than you know, Harry.

546
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:33,295
In time, you'll come to see
just how much.

547
00:47:36,757 --> 00:47:41,136
Honeyduke's Sweetshop is brilliant,
but nothing beats Zonko's Joke Shop.

548
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:43,889
We never got to go
to the Shrieking Shack.

549
00:47:44,056 --> 00:47:48,101
- You heard it's the most...
- Haunted building in Britain. I know.

550
00:47:49,478 --> 00:47:50,979
What's going on?

551
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:53,607
Probably Neville forgot
the password again.

552
00:47:53,774 --> 00:47:56,193
- Hey.
- Oh, you're there.

553
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:00,656
Let me through, please.
Excuse me! I'm Head Boy!

554
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:03,951
Get back, all of you.

555
00:48:04,117 --> 00:48:07,287
No one is to enter this dormitory
until it's been searched.

556
00:48:07,454 --> 00:48:08,789
The Fat Lady! She's gone!

557
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:13,335
Serves her right.
She was a terrible singer.

558
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:15,420
It's not funny, Ron.

559
00:48:17,422 --> 00:48:21,510
Keep calm, everyone. Break into fours.
Back to your common room.

560
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,892
- Be quiet.
- Make way.

561
00:48:29,101 --> 00:48:31,061
- The headmaster's here.
- Come on, move.

562
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,146
You heard. Move!

563
00:48:47,369 --> 00:48:50,247
Mr. Filch? Round up the ghosts.

564
00:48:50,581 --> 00:48:54,668
Tell them to search every painting
in the castle to find the Fat Lady.

565
00:48:54,877 --> 00:48:57,963
There's no need for ghosts, professor.

566
00:48:58,797 --> 00:49:00,924
The Fat Lady's there.

567
00:49:01,758 --> 00:49:03,760
Mind where you're going! Slow down!

568
00:49:04,344 --> 00:49:07,014
You listen! I'm Head Boy!

569
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:09,600
- Come back here!
- Keep moving!

570
00:49:13,187 --> 00:49:16,064
Dear lady, who did this to you?

571
00:49:17,983 --> 00:49:23,030
Eyes like the devil, he's got,
and a soul as dark as his name.

572
00:49:23,947 --> 00:49:26,950
It's him, headmaster.
The one they all talk about.

573
00:49:27,117 --> 00:49:29,578
He's here, somewhere in the castle!

574
00:49:29,828 --> 00:49:31,997
Sirius Black!

575
00:49:32,206 --> 00:49:37,336
Secure the castle, Mr. Filch.
The rest of you, to the Great Hall.

576
00:50:05,405 --> 00:50:10,327
I've searched the Astronomy Tower
and the Owlery. There's nothing there.

577
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:13,080
- Thank you.
- The third floor's clear too, sir.

578
00:50:13,247 --> 00:50:15,207
- Very good.
- I've done the dungeons.

579
00:50:15,374 --> 00:50:18,043
No sign of Black, nor anywhere else
in the castle.

580
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:20,754
I didn't really expect him to linger.

581
00:50:22,005 --> 00:50:24,341
Remarkable feat, don't you think?

582
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:26,802
To enter Hogwarts Castle
on one's own...

583
00:50:26,969 --> 00:50:29,638
...completely undetected?
- Quite remarkable, yes.

584
00:50:29,847 --> 00:50:31,682
Any theories on how he managed it?

585
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:34,852
Many. Each as unlikely as the next.

586
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:36,645
You may recall...

587
00:50:36,812 --> 00:50:39,648
...prior to the start of term
I expressed concerns...

588
00:50:39,815 --> 00:50:41,900
...about your appointment
of Professor...

589
00:50:42,067 --> 00:50:46,154
Not a single professor inside this castle
would help Sirius Black enter it.

590
00:50:46,321 --> 00:50:48,740
I'm quite convinced
the castle is safe...

591
00:50:48,907 --> 00:50:52,536
...and I'm more than willing to send
the students to their houses.

592
00:50:52,703 --> 00:50:55,038
What about Potter?
Should he be warned?

593
00:50:55,247 --> 00:50:57,875
Perhaps. But for now, let him sleep.

594
00:50:58,750 --> 00:51:03,463
For in dreams, we enter a world
that's entirely our own.

595
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:08,262
Let them swim in the deepest ocean
or glide over the highest cloud.

596
00:51:47,591 --> 00:51:50,928
Turn to page 394.

597
00:52:00,354 --> 00:52:03,941
Excuse me, sir.
Where's Professor Lupin?

598
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:08,070
That's not really your concern,
is it, Potter?

599
00:52:08,237 --> 00:52:12,115
Suffice it to say your professor
finds himself incapable of teaching...

600
00:52:12,324 --> 00:52:17,371
...at the present time.
Turn to page 394.

601
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:23,877
"Werewolves"?

602
00:52:24,211 --> 00:52:26,964
Sir, we just learned about red caps
and hinkypunks.

603
00:52:27,214 --> 00:52:30,342
- We're not meant to start that for weeks.
- Quiet.

604
00:52:30,551 --> 00:52:33,720
When did she come in?
Did you see her come in?

605
00:52:34,346 --> 00:52:37,850
Now, which one of you
can tell me the difference...

606
00:52:38,058 --> 00:52:40,477
...between an Animagus
and a werewolf?

607
00:52:41,186 --> 00:52:43,105
No one?

608
00:52:43,605 --> 00:52:46,525
- How disappointing.
- Please, sir.

609
00:52:46,733 --> 00:52:49,903
An Animagus is a wizard
who elects to turn into an animal.

610
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,613
A werewolf has no choice.

611
00:52:52,030 --> 00:52:53,740
With each full moon...

612
00:52:53,907 --> 00:52:57,786
...he no longer remembers who he is.
He'd kill his best friend.

613
00:52:57,995 --> 00:53:01,582
The werewolf only responds
to the call of its own kind.

614
00:53:02,749 --> 00:53:05,502
Thank you, Mr. Malfoy.
That's the second time...

615
00:53:05,669 --> 00:53:08,005
...you've spoken out of turn,
Miss Granger.

616
00:53:08,171 --> 00:53:10,174
Are you incapable
of restraining yourself...

617
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:13,677
...or do you take pride
in being an insufferable know-it-all?

618
00:53:13,969 --> 00:53:17,389
- He's got a point, you know.
- Five points from Gryffindor.

619
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:22,186
As an antidote to your ignorance,
and on my desk, by Monday morning...

620
00:53:22,394 --> 00:53:26,106
...two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf, with emphasis...

621
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:28,859
...on recognizing it.
- It's Quidditch tomorrow.

622
00:53:29,943 --> 00:53:33,280
Then I suggest you take extra care,
Mr. Potter.

623
00:53:33,488 --> 00:53:37,534
Loss of limb will not excuse you.

624
00:53:37,743 --> 00:53:41,496

625
00:53:43,498 --> 00:53:44,958
The term "werewolf"...

626
00:53:45,876 --> 00:53:50,380
<i>...is a contraction
of the Anglo-Saxon word "wer"...</i>

627
00:53:51,131 --> 00:53:55,552
...which means "man, " and "wolf. "
Werewolf, man-wolf.

628
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,555
There are several ways
to become a werewolf.

629
00:53:58,764 --> 00:54:01,767
They include being given the power
of shape-shifting...

630
00:54:02,017 --> 00:54:03,936
...being bitten by a werewolf...

631
00:54:22,746 --> 00:54:26,375
Go, Harry! Go, Harry!

632
00:56:26,161 --> 00:56:28,997
<i>Aresto momentum!</i>

633
00:56:31,250 --> 00:56:34,378
- He looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
- Peaky?

634
00:56:34,545 --> 00:56:36,839
What do you expect?
He fell over 100 feet.

635
00:56:37,005 --> 00:56:39,883
Let's walk you off a tower
and see what you look like.

636
00:56:40,092 --> 00:56:43,136
Probably a right sight better
than he normally does.

637
00:56:46,807 --> 00:56:49,768
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, brilliant.

638
00:56:49,977 --> 00:56:51,937
You gave us a right good scare.

639
00:56:52,187 --> 00:56:55,691
- What happened?
- Well, you fell off your broom.

640
00:56:55,983 --> 00:56:58,318
Really? I meant the match. Who won?

641
00:57:02,739 --> 00:57:04,449
No one blames you, Harry.

642
00:57:04,658 --> 00:57:08,495
Dementors aren't supposed to be
on the grounds. Dumbledore's furious.

643
00:57:08,704 --> 00:57:10,789
After he saved you,
he sent them off.

644
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:14,626
There's something else
you should know too.

645
00:57:15,168 --> 00:57:20,508
When you fell, your broom sort of blew
into the Whomping Willow, and...

646
00:57:22,009 --> 00:57:23,510
Well...

647
00:57:24,761 --> 00:57:27,055
<i>I'm sorry to hear
about your broomstick.</i>

648
00:57:27,389 --> 00:57:30,017
Is there no chance of fixing it?

649
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:31,560
No.

650
00:57:31,727 --> 00:57:35,063
Professor, why do the dementors
affect me so?

651
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:38,567
- I mean, more than everyone else?
- Listen.

652
00:57:38,734 --> 00:57:41,904
Dementors are the foulest creatures
to walk this earth.

653
00:57:42,112 --> 00:57:46,366
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory...

654
00:57:46,909 --> 00:57:51,496
...until a person is left with absolutely
nothing but his worst experiences.

655
00:57:51,705 --> 00:57:55,918
You are not weak, Harry.

656
00:57:56,084 --> 00:58:00,172
Dementors affect you most because
there are true horrors in your past.

657
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:03,467
Horrors your classmates
can scarcely imagine.

658
00:58:03,926 --> 00:58:06,220
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

659
00:58:06,428 --> 00:58:10,474
- I'm scared, professor.
- I'd consider you a fool if you weren't.

660
00:58:10,641 --> 00:58:14,144
I need to know how to fight them.
You could teach me.

661
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:16,313
You made the one
on the train go away.

662
00:58:16,522 --> 00:58:18,273
There was only one that night.

663
00:58:18,565 --> 00:58:23,153
- But you made it go away.
- I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry.

664
00:58:23,487 --> 00:58:28,450
But as the dementors seem
to have developed an interest in you...

665
00:58:28,617 --> 00:58:32,287
...perhaps I should teach you.
But after the holidays.

666
00:58:32,454 --> 00:58:34,373
For now, I need to rest.

667
00:58:59,815 --> 00:59:04,111
Last call for Hogsmeade!
Come on, now!

668
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:21,712
- Guys, let me go.
- Clever, Harry.

669
00:59:21,879 --> 00:59:24,798
- But not clever enough.
- We've got a better way.

670
00:59:24,965 --> 00:59:27,801
- I'm trying to get to Hogsmeade.
- We know.

671
00:59:27,968 --> 00:59:29,178
We'll get you there.

672
00:59:29,344 --> 00:59:32,055
- We'll show you a quicker way.
- Lf you pipe down.

673
00:59:32,222 --> 00:59:35,809
- Bless him.
- Let me go! Come on, guys. Don't...

674
00:59:36,435 --> 00:59:39,021
- Now, Harry.
- Come and join the big boys.

675
00:59:40,439 --> 00:59:42,566
What are you doing?!

676
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:45,652
- What's this rubbish?
- "What's this rubbish?" he says.

677
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:49,156
- It's the secret to our success.
- It's a wrench giving it to you...

678
00:59:49,323 --> 00:59:52,242
But we've decided
your needs are greater than ours.

679
00:59:52,409 --> 00:59:54,161
George, if you will.

680
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:57,623
I solemnly swear
that I am up to no good.

681
01:00:01,251 --> 01:00:04,838
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail,
Padfoot and Prongs...

682
01:00:05,255 --> 01:00:08,217
...are proud to present
the Marauder's Map. "

683
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:10,719
We owe them so much.

684
01:00:14,264 --> 01:00:18,101
Hang on. This is Hogwarts.
And that...

685
01:00:18,268 --> 01:00:20,729
- No. Is that really...?
- Dumbledore.

686
01:00:20,896 --> 01:00:22,231
- In his study.
- Pacing.

687
01:00:22,397 --> 01:00:24,358
Does that a lot.

688
01:00:24,566 --> 01:00:26,401
- So this map shows...
- Everyone.

689
01:00:26,610 --> 01:00:28,612
- Where they are.
- What they're doing.

690
01:00:28,779 --> 01:00:29,905
- Every minute.
- Every day.

691
01:00:30,072 --> 01:00:33,075
- Brilliant! Where did you get it?
- From Filch's office.

692
01:00:33,242 --> 01:00:35,994
- First year.
- There are seven secret passageways...

693
01:00:36,161 --> 01:00:38,830
...out of the castle.
- We'd recommend this one.

694
01:00:38,997 --> 01:00:42,167
- The One-Eyed Witch passageway.
- Leads you to Honeyduke's.

695
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:44,169
Hurry. Filch is heading this way.

696
01:00:44,336 --> 01:00:47,756
And don't forget. When you're done,
just give it a tap and say:

697
01:00:47,923 --> 01:00:52,261
"Mischief managed. "
Otherwise, anyone can read it.

698
01:01:27,588 --> 01:01:29,798
Now, how much do you want?

699
01:01:37,097 --> 01:01:39,016
Delicious.

700
01:01:47,024 --> 01:01:51,111
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I mention that?

701
01:01:51,278 --> 01:01:52,946
Twice.

702
01:01:53,655 --> 01:01:55,991
Do you want to move a bit closer?

703
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,910
To the Shrieking Shack?

704
01:01:58,202 --> 01:02:01,079
Actually, I'm fine here.

705
01:02:01,246 --> 01:02:03,081
Well, well. Look who's here.

706
01:02:03,457 --> 01:02:05,751
You two shopping for your new
dream home?

707
01:02:05,959 --> 01:02:10,255
Bit grand for you, isn't it, Weasle-Bee?
Don't your family sleep in one room?

708
01:02:10,464 --> 01:02:13,675
- Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
- Not very friendly.

709
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:19,097
Boys, I think it's time we teach
Weasle-Bee how to respect his superiors.

710
01:02:19,306 --> 01:02:22,726
- Hope you don't mean yourself.
- How dare you talk to me!

711
01:02:22,893 --> 01:02:24,895
You filthy little mudblood!

712
01:02:29,107 --> 01:02:30,651
Who is that?

713
01:02:36,865 --> 01:02:39,243
- Don't stand there! Do something!
- What?

714
01:02:59,054 --> 01:03:01,348
What's up, Malfoy? Lost your skis?

715
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:06,728
Get out of the way!

716
01:03:06,895 --> 01:03:08,522
Move!

717
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:11,984
Malfoy! Wait! Wait!

718
01:03:15,737 --> 01:03:17,698
Harry!

719
01:03:17,865 --> 01:03:21,910
Bloody hell, Harry.
That was not funny.

720
01:03:23,078 --> 01:03:26,331
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map.

721
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,960
He won't keep it. He'll turn it over
to Professor McGonagall.

722
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:34,173
- Aren't you?
- Sure. Along with his Invisibility Cloak.

723
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:36,842
Look who it is. Madam Rosmerta.

724
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:39,344
- Ron fancies her.
- That's not true!

725
01:03:39,511 --> 01:03:41,388
- Professor McGonagall!
- Cornelius!

726
01:03:41,555 --> 01:03:42,931
Allow me, minister.

727
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:44,975
- Oh, Hagrid...
- Sorry about that.

728
01:03:45,184 --> 01:03:48,103
Rosmerta, my dear.
I hope business is good.

729
01:03:48,312 --> 01:03:52,191
It'd be a lot better if the Ministry
wasn't sending dementors...

730
01:03:52,357 --> 01:03:56,403
...into my pub every other night!
- We have...

731
01:03:56,820 --> 01:04:00,032
- We have a killer on the loose.
- Sirius Black in Hogsmeade!

732
01:04:00,365 --> 01:04:02,826
And what would bring him here?

733
01:04:02,993 --> 01:04:07,164
- Harry Potter.
- Harry Potter?

734
01:04:07,331 --> 01:04:09,082
Come.

735
01:04:11,627 --> 01:04:13,629
Harry!

736
01:04:21,345 --> 01:04:25,807
- No underage wizards allowed in today!
- Shut the damn door!

737
01:04:26,016 --> 01:04:28,018
- So rude.
- Thick heads.

738
01:04:28,268 --> 01:04:29,853
- Thick heads?!
- How dare they!

739
01:04:30,062 --> 01:04:33,232
- Who are they calling thick heads?
- Young whippersnappers!

740
01:04:33,982 --> 01:04:37,903
Nobody will come to a pub where
they'll get scared out of their wits.

741
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:41,990
Professor Dumbledore doesn't want
dementors around the place.

742
01:04:44,785 --> 01:04:46,578
Tell me what this is all about.

743
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:51,208
Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents
realized they were marked for death...

744
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:54,044
Remember? They hid.
Few knew where they were.

745
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:58,090
One who did was Sirius Black.
And he told You-Know-Who.

746
01:04:58,298 --> 01:05:01,510
Not only did Black lead him
to the Potters that night...

747
01:05:01,677 --> 01:05:05,055
...he also killed Peter Pettigrew!

748
01:05:05,305 --> 01:05:07,474
- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.

749
01:05:07,641 --> 01:05:09,893
- Always trailing after Black.
- I remember.

750
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:11,895
Never let James and Sirius
out of his sight.

751
01:05:12,062 --> 01:05:14,815
- What happened?
- Peter tried to warn the Potters...

752
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:19,152
...and might have, had he not
run into an old friend, Sirius Black.

753
01:05:19,361 --> 01:05:23,198
Black was vicious.
He didn't kill Pettigrew.

754
01:05:23,407 --> 01:05:25,576
He destroyed him!

755
01:05:26,201 --> 01:05:30,956
A finger. That's all that was left.
A finger. Nothing else.

756
01:05:31,123 --> 01:05:34,168
Sirius Black may not have
put his hands to the Potters...

757
01:05:34,334 --> 01:05:37,546
...but he's the reason they're dead.
- He wants to finish things.

758
01:05:37,754 --> 01:05:40,591
- I don't believe it.
- That's not the worst of it.

759
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:44,553
- What could be worse?
- This: Sirius Black was...

760
01:05:44,761 --> 01:05:46,889
...and remains to this day...

761
01:05:47,347 --> 01:05:48,974
...Harry Potter's godfather!

762
01:05:57,608 --> 01:05:59,902
Ron, look!

763
01:06:05,616 --> 01:06:08,202
- Sorry. Excuse me, excuse me.
- Merry Christmas.

764
01:06:46,657 --> 01:06:48,492
Harry, what happened?

765
01:06:50,994 --> 01:06:53,121
He was their friend...

766
01:06:53,622 --> 01:06:55,874
...and he betrayed them.

767
01:06:56,667 --> 01:06:58,627
He was their friend!

768
01:07:00,879 --> 01:07:02,840
I hope he finds me.

769
01:07:03,465 --> 01:07:05,801
Because when he does,
I'm gonna be ready!

770
01:07:06,260 --> 01:07:08,887
When he does, I'm gonna kill him!

771
01:07:23,151 --> 01:07:24,778
<i>Harry.</i>

772
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:26,947
<i>There you are. You came.</i>

773
01:07:27,322 --> 01:07:31,201
Are you sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic...

774
01:07:31,368 --> 01:07:33,829
...well beyond the Ordinary
Wizarding Level.

775
01:07:33,996 --> 01:07:35,539
I'm sure.

776
01:07:36,123 --> 01:07:38,584
Well, everything's prepared.

777
01:07:38,834 --> 01:07:42,212
The spell I'm going to teach you
is called the Patronus Charm.

778
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:43,881
Did you ever hear of it?

779
01:07:44,047 --> 01:07:45,716
No? Well...

780
01:07:45,883 --> 01:07:49,469
A Patronus is a positive force.
For the wizard who conjures one...

781
01:07:49,636 --> 01:07:54,308
...it works like a shield, with the
dementor feeding on it rather than him.

782
01:07:54,474 --> 01:07:58,312
But in order for it to work,
you need to think of a memory.

783
01:07:58,478 --> 01:08:02,441
Not just any memory, a very happy
memory, a very powerful memory.

784
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:06,445
Can you do this?
Yes. Very well.

785
01:08:07,654 --> 01:08:09,865
Close your eyes.

786
01:08:11,658 --> 01:08:13,535
Concentrate.

787
01:08:14,786 --> 01:08:16,872
Explore your past.

788
01:08:17,372 --> 01:08:19,249
Do you have a memory?

789
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:23,045
Allow it to fill you up.

790
01:08:23,754 --> 01:08:25,839
Lose yourself within it.

791
01:08:26,173 --> 01:08:31,512
<i>Then speak the incantation,
Expecto Patronum.</i>

792
01:08:31,929 --> 01:08:34,765
<i>- Expecto Patronum.
- Very good.</i>

793
01:08:38,560 --> 01:08:41,897
Shall we? Wand at the ready.

794
01:08:59,414 --> 01:09:02,334
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

795
01:09:02,793 --> 01:09:06,463
<i>Expecto... Expecto...</i>

796
01:09:06,713 --> 01:09:08,423
<i>Expect...</i>

797
01:09:10,425 --> 01:09:14,513
Here we go. Come on.
Sit up. Deep breaths.

798
01:09:14,805 --> 01:09:18,600
It's all right. I didn't expect you
to do it the first time.

799
01:09:19,017 --> 01:09:24,147
That would have been remarkable.
Here, eat this. You'll feel better.

800
01:09:24,982 --> 01:09:27,860
- That's one nasty dementor.
- Oh, no, no, no.

801
01:09:28,068 --> 01:09:30,821
That was a boggart, Harry.
A boggart.

802
01:09:30,988 --> 01:09:34,157
The real thing would be worse.
Much, much worse.

803
01:09:34,324 --> 01:09:36,952
As a matter of interest,
what were you thinking?

804
01:09:37,119 --> 01:09:40,831
- Which memory did you choose?
- The first time I rode a broom.

805
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:45,377
That's not good enough.
Not nearly good enough.

806
01:09:52,259 --> 01:09:57,514
There's another.
It's not happy, exactly.

807
01:09:59,433 --> 01:10:01,560
Well, it is.

808
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:04,313
It's the happiest I've ever felt...

809
01:10:04,479 --> 01:10:08,442
...but it's complicated.
- Is it strong?

810
01:10:12,821 --> 01:10:15,657
Then let's give it a try. You feel ready?

811
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:19,203
Just do it.

812
01:10:29,254 --> 01:10:32,508
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

813
01:10:33,759 --> 01:10:37,721
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

814
01:10:59,326 --> 01:11:00,410
Yes!

815
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:05,791
Well done, Harry. Well done!

816
01:11:06,333 --> 01:11:10,462
- I think I've had enough for today.
- Yes. Sit down. Here.

817
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:13,048
Eat this, it helps. It really helps.

818
01:11:13,215 --> 01:11:15,008
And just so you know, Harry...

819
01:11:15,175 --> 01:11:19,179
...I think you'd have given your father
a run for his money. And that...

820
01:11:19,346 --> 01:11:21,390
...is saying something.

821
01:11:23,559 --> 01:11:25,561
I was thinking of him.

822
01:11:25,727 --> 01:11:27,896
And Mum.

823
01:11:28,063 --> 01:11:30,315
Seeing their faces.

824
01:11:30,941 --> 01:11:33,652
They were talking to me.

825
01:11:33,819 --> 01:11:36,071
Just talking.

826
01:11:36,238 --> 01:11:38,574
That's the memory I chose.

827
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,661
I don't even know if it's real.

828
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:45,330
But it's the best I have.

829
01:11:54,548 --> 01:11:56,884
- Beautiful day.
- Gorgeous.

830
01:11:57,050 --> 01:11:59,052
Unless you've been ripped to pieces!

831
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:01,638
Ripped to pieces?
What are you talking about?

832
01:12:01,805 --> 01:12:04,975
- Ronald has lost his rat.
- I haven't lost anything!

833
01:12:05,142 --> 01:12:07,269
- Your cat killed him!
- Rubbish.

834
01:12:07,436 --> 01:12:10,772
Harry, you've seen the way
that bloodthirsty beast of hers...

835
01:12:10,939 --> 01:12:14,860
...is always lurking about.
And Scabbers is gone.

836
01:12:15,027 --> 01:12:17,905
Well, maybe you should
take better care of your pets!

837
01:12:18,071 --> 01:12:20,157
- Your cat killed him!
- Did not.

838
01:12:20,324 --> 01:12:21,825
- Did.
- Didn't.

839
01:12:23,869 --> 01:12:26,496
How did it go, Hagrid? The hearing?

840
01:12:26,663 --> 01:12:29,958
Well, first off, the committee members
took turns...

841
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:32,794
...talking about why we were there.

842
01:12:34,671 --> 01:12:37,341
I got up and did my piece.
Said how Buckbeak...

843
01:12:37,508 --> 01:12:40,469
...was a good hippogriff,
always cleaned his feathers.

844
01:12:40,677 --> 01:12:43,722
And then Lucius Malfoy got up.
Well, you can imagine.

845
01:12:43,889 --> 01:12:47,100
He said Buckbeak was a deadly
and dangerous creature...

846
01:12:47,267 --> 01:12:50,312
...who would kill you
as soon as look at you.

847
01:12:50,521 --> 01:12:52,314
And then?

848
01:12:53,023 --> 01:12:55,734
And then he asked for the worst,
did old Lucius.

849
01:12:55,901 --> 01:13:00,030
- They're not sacking you!
- No, I'm not sacked.

850
01:13:02,115 --> 01:13:05,118
Buckbeak's been sentenced to death!

851
01:13:31,895 --> 01:13:37,526
Spiders! There's... There's spiders.
Spiders. They want me to tap-dance.

852
01:13:37,734 --> 01:13:40,279
- I don't wanna tap-dance!
- Tell those spiders.

853
01:13:40,487 --> 01:13:44,449
Right, yeah. Tell them. I'll tell them...

854
01:14:02,593 --> 01:14:04,761
<i>- Peter Pettigrew?
- Little lump of a boy.</i>

855
01:14:04,928 --> 01:14:08,056
- Always trailing after Sirius Black.
- Black was vicious.

856
01:14:08,265 --> 01:14:10,726
He didn't kill Pettigrew,
he destroyed him!

857
01:14:18,817 --> 01:14:22,279
- Put that light out!
- Sorry.

858
01:15:05,531 --> 01:15:09,660
- Watch it there, boy.
- We're trying to sleep here!

859
01:15:17,876 --> 01:15:20,462
<i>Mischief managed. Nox.</i>

860
01:15:22,673 --> 01:15:24,007
Potter.

861
01:15:24,174 --> 01:15:27,678
What are you doing
wandering the corridors at night?

862
01:15:27,845 --> 01:15:29,012
I was sleepwalking.

863
01:15:29,179 --> 01:15:31,723
How extraordinarily like your father
you are, Potter.

864
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:36,645
He, too, was exceedingly arrogant,
strutting about the castle.

865
01:15:36,854 --> 01:15:41,191
My dad didn't strut. And nor do I.

866
01:15:41,942 --> 01:15:45,028
If you don't mind, I would appreciate
it if you could lower your wand.

867
01:15:48,657 --> 01:15:50,450
Turn out your pockets.

868
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,788
Turn out your pockets!

869
01:15:57,708 --> 01:15:59,334
What's this?

870
01:15:59,501 --> 01:16:02,754
- Spare bit of parchment.
- Really? Open it.

871
01:16:09,261 --> 01:16:13,015
Reveal your secrets.

872
01:16:16,810 --> 01:16:18,270
Read it.

873
01:16:20,731 --> 01:16:26,236
"Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot,
and Prongs...

874
01:16:26,403 --> 01:16:30,532
...offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and... "

875
01:16:30,824 --> 01:16:32,284
Go on.

876
01:16:33,493 --> 01:16:37,331
"And request he keep his large nose
out of other people's business. "

877
01:16:37,581 --> 01:16:40,125
- You insolent little...
- Professor!

878
01:16:41,752 --> 01:16:44,463
Well, well. Lupin.

879
01:16:44,630 --> 01:16:49,343
Out for a little walk
in the moonlight, are we?

880
01:16:50,719 --> 01:16:53,096
Harry, are you all right?

881
01:16:53,347 --> 01:16:55,807
That remains to be seen.

882
01:16:56,642 --> 01:17:00,395
I have now just confiscated
a rather curious artifact.

883
01:17:00,562 --> 01:17:04,066
Take a look, Lupin.
Supposed to be your area of expertise.

884
01:17:04,274 --> 01:17:09,071
- Clearly, it's full of dark magic.
- I seriously doubt it, Severus.

885
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:12,741
It looks as though it's a parchment
designed to insult anyone...

886
01:17:12,908 --> 01:17:16,745
...who tries to read it.
I suspect it's a Zonko product.

887
01:17:16,954 --> 01:17:21,208
Nevertheless, I shall investigate
any hidden qualities it may possess.

888
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:24,461
It is, after all, as you say,
my area of expertise.

889
01:17:24,670 --> 01:17:28,006
Harry, would you come with me,
please? Professor, good night.

890
01:17:34,012 --> 01:17:36,765
Are you deaf? Put that light out!

891
01:17:41,854 --> 01:17:43,313
Come in.

892
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:50,320
I haven't the faintest idea how this map
came to be in your possession...

893
01:17:50,487 --> 01:17:54,950
...but quite frankly, I am astounded
that you didn't hand it in.

894
01:17:55,158 --> 01:17:58,829
Did it never occur to you that this,
in the hands of Sirius Black...

895
01:17:58,996 --> 01:18:00,956
...is a map to you?

896
01:18:01,832 --> 01:18:04,293
- No.
- No, sir.

897
01:18:06,295 --> 01:18:09,298
Your father never set much store
by the rules either.

898
01:18:09,506 --> 01:18:13,802
But he and your mother
gave their lives to save yours.

899
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:18,557
Gambling their sacrifice
by wandering the castle unprotected...

900
01:18:18,724 --> 01:18:23,187
...with a killer on the loose
seems to me a poor way to repay them!

901
01:18:23,395 --> 01:18:25,522
Now, I will not cover up for you again.

902
01:18:25,731 --> 01:18:28,192
- Do you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

903
01:18:28,358 --> 01:18:32,029
I want you to return to your dormitory
and stay there.

904
01:18:32,196 --> 01:18:36,909
And don't take any detours.
If you do, I shall know.

905
01:18:41,622 --> 01:18:46,001
Professor, just so you know,
I don't think that map always works.

906
01:18:46,919 --> 01:18:51,882
Earlier, it showed someone in the castle.
Someone I know to be dead.

907
01:18:52,299 --> 01:18:55,052
Oh, really? And who might that be?

908
01:18:55,219 --> 01:18:56,762
Peter Pettigrew.

909
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:01,433
That's not possible.

910
01:19:02,684 --> 01:19:04,311
It's just what I saw.

911
01:19:07,189 --> 01:19:08,899
Good night, professor.

912
01:19:12,402 --> 01:19:16,532
Broaden your minds.
You must look beyond.

913
01:19:16,740 --> 01:19:22,162
The art of crystal gazing
is in the clearing of the Inner Eye.

914
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:25,666
Only then can you see. Try again.

915
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:28,252
Now, what do we have here?

916
01:19:30,629 --> 01:19:32,840
Do you mind me trying?

917
01:19:35,259 --> 01:19:38,220
The Grim, possibly.

918
01:19:40,389 --> 01:19:44,476
My dear, from the first moment
you stepped foot in my class...

919
01:19:44,643 --> 01:19:48,397
...I sensed that you did not possess
the proper spirit...

920
01:19:48,605 --> 01:19:52,526
...for the noble art of Divination.
No, you see, there.

921
01:19:52,693 --> 01:19:56,363
You may be young in years,
but your heart is as shriveled...

922
01:19:56,530 --> 01:20:00,534
...as an old maid's, your soul
as dry as the pages of the books...

923
01:20:00,701 --> 01:20:03,787
...to which you so desperately cleave.

924
01:20:19,344 --> 01:20:21,305
Have I said something?

925
01:20:26,018 --> 01:20:30,981
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
Not that she wasn't always mental...

926
01:20:31,190 --> 01:20:33,734
...but now it's in the open
for everyone to see.

927
01:20:33,942 --> 01:20:36,069
Hang on.

928
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,198
- We better take this back.
- I'm not going back.

929
01:20:39,531 --> 01:20:42,951
- Fine. See you later.
- See you.

930
01:21:20,697 --> 01:21:25,994
<i>Harry Potter...</i>

931
01:21:32,876 --> 01:21:37,089
- Professor Trelawney...
- He will return tonight.

932
01:21:37,297 --> 01:21:38,924
Sorry?

933
01:21:39,132 --> 01:21:43,762
Tonight, he who betrayed his friends,
whose heart rots with murder...

934
01:21:43,929 --> 01:21:45,973
...shall break free.

935
01:21:46,139 --> 01:21:48,350
Innocent blood shall be spilt...

936
01:21:48,559 --> 01:21:53,565
...and servant and master
shall be reunited once more.

937
01:22:00,904 --> 01:22:04,157
I'm so sorry, dear boy.
Did you say something?

938
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:06,743
No.

939
01:22:07,202 --> 01:22:08,745
Nothing.

940
01:23:01,340 --> 01:23:05,385
I can't believe they're going to kill
Buckbeak. It's just too horrible.

941
01:23:05,552 --> 01:23:08,305
- It just got worse.
- What did I say? Father said...

942
01:23:08,472 --> 01:23:12,643
...I can keep the hippogriff's head.
I'll donate it to the Gryffindors' room.

943
01:23:12,809 --> 01:23:15,270
This is going to be rich.

944
01:23:15,479 --> 01:23:17,606
- Look who's here.
- Come to see the show?

945
01:23:17,814 --> 01:23:20,901
You! You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

946
01:23:21,109 --> 01:23:22,819
Hermione, no!

947
01:23:23,445 --> 01:23:25,656
He's not worth it.

948
01:23:39,795 --> 01:23:41,839
Malfoy, are you okay?

949
01:23:42,047 --> 01:23:46,260
- Let's go. Quick.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

950
01:23:46,426 --> 01:23:50,806
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

951
01:24:10,284 --> 01:24:14,580
Look at him. Loves the smell of the trees
when the wind blows through them.

952
01:24:14,746 --> 01:24:17,040
Why don't we just set him free?

953
01:24:17,207 --> 01:24:19,585
They'd know it was me,
and then Dumbledore...

954
01:24:19,793 --> 01:24:22,796
...would get into trouble.
He's coming down, Dumbledore.

955
01:24:22,963 --> 01:24:25,340
Says he wants to be with me
when they...

956
01:24:26,341 --> 01:24:28,385
When it happens.

957
01:24:28,552 --> 01:24:29,887
Great man, Dumbledore.

958
01:24:30,888 --> 01:24:32,431
A great man.

959
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:37,895
- We'll stay with you too.
- You'll do no such thing!

960
01:24:38,061 --> 01:24:41,231
Think I want you seeing
something like that? No.

961
01:24:41,398 --> 01:24:45,068
You just drink your tea and be off.
Oh. Before you do, Ron...

962
01:24:52,493 --> 01:24:54,870
Scabbers! You're alive!

963
01:24:55,037 --> 01:24:58,707
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- I think you owe someone an apology.

964
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:02,669
Right. Next time I see Crookshanks,
I'll let him know.

965
01:25:02,836 --> 01:25:03,921
I meant me!

966
01:25:04,630 --> 01:25:06,840
Blimey. What was that?

967
01:25:13,305 --> 01:25:14,681
Hagrid!

968
01:25:16,642 --> 01:25:17,976
Oh, crikey.

969
01:25:19,436 --> 01:25:22,189
No, minister. Over this way.

970
01:25:22,397 --> 01:25:26,485
It's late. It's nearly dark.
You shouldn't be here.

971
01:25:26,652 --> 01:25:30,405
Someone sees you outside
this time of night, you'll be in trouble.

972
01:25:30,614 --> 01:25:34,201
Particularly you, Harry.
With you in a moment!

973
01:25:35,619 --> 01:25:37,996
Quick. Quick!

974
01:25:38,205 --> 01:25:39,915
Hagrid.

975
01:25:40,123 --> 01:25:44,044
- It'll be fine. It'll be okay.
- Go on, go on!

976
01:25:45,879 --> 01:25:48,674
- That's ling you see over there...
- On the slope.

977
01:25:48,841 --> 01:25:51,510
- On the slope... Ah, Hagrid.
- Professor Dumbledore.

978
01:25:51,677 --> 01:25:54,388
- Good evening.
- Minister. Make your way through.

979
01:25:54,596 --> 01:25:58,433
- Have a tea, if you like.
- No, Hagrid.

980
01:26:00,519 --> 01:26:03,063
- Gentlemen.
- I'd like a cup of tea.

981
01:26:03,313 --> 01:26:06,650
Well, I think we should get down
to our business, shall we?

982
01:26:07,818 --> 01:26:11,405
Very well. It is the decision
of the Committee for the Disposal...

983
01:26:11,572 --> 01:26:14,741
...of Dangerous Creatures
that the hippogriff Buckbeak...

984
01:26:14,908 --> 01:26:20,414
...hereinafter called "the condemned,"
shall be executed this day at sundown.

985
01:26:20,581 --> 01:26:24,084
- Dear, dear...
- Now, now, Hagrid. Now, come on.

986
01:26:24,334 --> 01:26:28,714
- All right. It'll be all right.
- The execution shall dispatch...

987
01:26:28,881 --> 01:26:30,591
What?

988
01:26:30,799 --> 01:26:32,843
I thought I just saw...

989
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:35,179
- Never mind.
- Let's go!

990
01:26:40,267 --> 01:26:42,561
Buckbeak didn't mean no harm.

991
01:27:29,107 --> 01:27:30,567
Oh, no.

992
01:27:41,495 --> 01:27:43,705
He bit me. Scabbers.

993
01:27:44,289 --> 01:27:46,250
Ron. Ron!

994
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:50,712
- Ron!
- Scabbers, come back.

995
01:27:52,256 --> 01:27:53,966
Wait!

996
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:04,226
- Scabbers, you bit me!
- Harry, you do realize what tree this is?

997
01:28:04,393 --> 01:28:06,687
That's not good. Ron, run!

998
01:28:09,815 --> 01:28:12,359
Harry, Hermione, run!

999
01:28:12,943 --> 01:28:14,570
It's the Grim!

1000
01:28:21,577 --> 01:28:24,580
- Harry!
- Ron! Ron, wait!

1001
01:28:24,830 --> 01:28:26,790
Harry!

1002
01:28:28,417 --> 01:28:30,794
- Help!
- Ron!

1003
01:28:32,921 --> 01:28:36,175
- Ron. Ron.
- Ron!

1004
01:28:51,023 --> 01:28:52,983
Come on!

1005
01:28:54,943 --> 01:28:56,361
Move!

1006
01:29:00,407 --> 01:29:02,117
Duck!

1007
01:29:38,028 --> 01:29:40,322
Harry!

1008
01:29:56,213 --> 01:29:59,216
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't worry.

1009
01:29:59,383 --> 01:30:03,303
- Where do you suppose this goes?
- I have a hunch.

1010
01:30:03,846 --> 01:30:05,347
I just hope I'm wrong.

1011
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:28,203
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?

1012
01:30:29,288 --> 01:30:30,914
Come on.

1013
01:30:41,258 --> 01:30:42,634
Ron.

1014
01:30:43,218 --> 01:30:45,846
- Ron. You're okay.
- The dog. Where is it?

1015
01:30:46,054 --> 01:30:49,224
It's a trap. He's the dog.
He's an Animagus.

1016
01:31:03,155 --> 01:31:05,908
If you want to kill Harry,
you have to kill us too!

1017
01:31:06,116 --> 01:31:07,910
No. Only one will die tonight.

1018
01:31:08,118 --> 01:31:09,995
Then it'll be you!

1019
01:31:16,251 --> 01:31:18,378
Are you going to kill me, Harry?

1020
01:31:19,630 --> 01:31:21,423
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1021
01:31:25,177 --> 01:31:29,348
Well, well, Sirius.
Looking rather ragged, aren't we?

1022
01:31:29,556 --> 01:31:32,559
Finally, the flesh
reflects the madness within.

1023
01:31:33,185 --> 01:31:36,772
Well, you'd know all about
the madness within, wouldn't you?

1024
01:31:47,241 --> 01:31:48,242
- I found him.
- I know.

1025
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:49,701
- It's him.
- I understand.

1026
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:53,080
- Let's kill him!
- No! I trusted you!

1027
01:31:53,539 --> 01:31:57,292
And all this time,
you've been his friend.

1028
01:31:58,001 --> 01:32:01,004
He's a werewolf!
That's why he's been missing classes.

1029
01:32:03,841 --> 01:32:05,551
How long have you known?

1030
01:32:06,051 --> 01:32:09,221
- Since Professor Snape set the essay.
- Well, Hermione.

1031
01:32:09,471 --> 01:32:12,391
You are the brightest witch
of your age I've ever met.

1032
01:32:12,558 --> 01:32:14,935
Enough talk, Remus!
Come on, let's kill him!

1033
01:32:15,185 --> 01:32:17,813
- Wait!
- I did my waiting!

1034
01:32:17,980 --> 01:32:20,357
Twelve years of it!

1035
01:32:21,024 --> 01:32:23,402
In Azkaban!

1036
01:32:32,870 --> 01:32:34,580
Very well. Kill him.

1037
01:32:35,205 --> 01:32:38,959
But wait one more minute.
Harry has the right to know why.

1038
01:32:39,126 --> 01:32:40,669
I know why.

1039
01:32:40,919 --> 01:32:43,130
You betrayed my parents.

1040
01:32:43,338 --> 01:32:46,258
- You're the reason they're dead!
- No, it wasn't him.

1041
01:32:46,425 --> 01:32:48,302
Somebody did betray your parents...

1042
01:32:48,510 --> 01:32:52,014
...somebody who, until quite recently,
I believed to be dead!

1043
01:32:52,222 --> 01:32:55,642
- Who was it, then?
- Peter Pettigrew!

1044
01:32:55,851 --> 01:32:58,937
And he's in this room! Right now!

1045
01:32:59,479 --> 01:33:02,441
Come out, come out, Peter!

1046
01:33:02,608 --> 01:33:05,611
<i>- Come out, come out and play!
- Expelliarmus!</i>

1047
01:33:08,572 --> 01:33:11,033
Vengeance is sweet.

1048
01:33:11,241 --> 01:33:13,452
How I hoped I'd be the one
to catch you.

1049
01:33:13,660 --> 01:33:14,995
Severus...

1050
01:33:15,162 --> 01:33:19,875
I told Dumbledore you were helping a
friend into the castle. Here's the proof.

1051
01:33:20,083 --> 01:33:21,418
Brilliant, Snape.

1052
01:33:21,585 --> 01:33:25,964
You've put your keen mind to the task
and come to the wrong conclusion.

1053
01:33:26,173 --> 01:33:28,842
If you'll excuse us,
Remus and I have business...

1054
01:33:29,009 --> 01:33:33,972
...to attend to.
- Give me a reason. I beg you!

1055
01:33:34,181 --> 01:33:36,725
- Don't be a fool.
- He can't help it. It's habit.

1056
01:33:36,975 --> 01:33:38,560
- Be quiet.
- Be quiet yourself!

1057
01:33:38,727 --> 01:33:41,104
You two, quarrelling
like an old married couple.

1058
01:33:41,313 --> 01:33:43,857
Run along and play with
your chemistry set!

1059
01:33:44,399 --> 01:33:46,860
I could do it, you know.

1060
01:33:47,361 --> 01:33:52,991
But why deny the dementors?
They're so longing to see you.

1061
01:33:53,158 --> 01:33:55,869
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
Oh, yes.

1062
01:33:56,036 --> 01:33:59,540
A Dementor's Kiss. One can only
imagine what that must be like.

1063
01:33:59,706 --> 01:34:05,128
It's said to be nearly unbearable
to witness, but I'll do my best.

1064
01:34:05,337 --> 01:34:07,548
Severus, please.

1065
01:34:08,632 --> 01:34:10,592
After you.

1066
01:34:15,055 --> 01:34:16,765
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1067
01:34:18,559 --> 01:34:22,145
- Harry! What did you just do?
- You attacked a teacher!

1068
01:34:22,354 --> 01:34:24,898
- Tell me about Peter.
- He was at school with us.

1069
01:34:25,107 --> 01:34:26,733
We thought he was our friend!

1070
01:34:26,942 --> 01:34:29,945
- No. Pettigrew's dead. You killed him!
- No, he didn't.

1071
01:34:30,112 --> 01:34:33,282
I thought so too, until you mentioned
Pettigrew on the map!

1072
01:34:33,532 --> 01:34:36,285
- The map was lying, then.
- The map never lies!

1073
01:34:36,493 --> 01:34:40,497
Pettigrew's alive!
And he's right there!

1074
01:34:40,956 --> 01:34:45,502
- Me?! He's mental!
- Not you! Your rat!

1075
01:34:45,836 --> 01:34:48,922
- Scabbers has been in my family for...
- Twelve years?

1076
01:34:49,131 --> 01:34:51,592
Curiously long life
for a common garden rat!

1077
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:54,344
- He's missing a toe, isn't he?
- So what?

1078
01:34:54,553 --> 01:34:57,472
- All they could find of
Pettigrew was his... - Finger!

1079
01:34:57,723 --> 01:35:00,976
Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was dead!

1080
01:35:01,143 --> 01:35:04,146
- And then he transformed into a rat!
- Show me.

1081
01:35:06,773 --> 01:35:09,860
- Give it to him, Ron.
- What are you trying to do to him?

1082
01:35:10,027 --> 01:35:11,111
Scabbers!

1083
01:35:11,278 --> 01:35:14,364
Leave him alone! Get off him!
What are you doing?

1084
01:35:36,845 --> 01:35:38,639
Remus?

1085
01:35:39,431 --> 01:35:40,933
Sirius.

1086
01:35:41,099 --> 01:35:42,976
My old friends!

1087
01:35:48,649 --> 01:35:52,486
Harry! Look at you.
You look so much like your father.

1088
01:35:52,653 --> 01:35:56,323
- James. We were the best of friends...
- How dare you speak to Harry!

1089
01:35:57,157 --> 01:35:59,785
How dare you talk about James
in front of him!

1090
01:35:59,993 --> 01:36:05,207
- You sold James and Lily to Voldemort!
- I didn't mean to!

1091
01:36:05,374 --> 01:36:08,210
The Dark Lord. You have no idea
the weapons he possesses!

1092
01:36:08,418 --> 01:36:11,046
Ask yourself, Sirius!
What would you have done?

1093
01:36:11,421 --> 01:36:17,010
- What would you have done?
- Died, rather than betray my friends!

1094
01:36:19,179 --> 01:36:21,557
James wouldn't have wanted
me killed!

1095
01:36:21,765 --> 01:36:27,437
Your dad would have spared me!
He would have shown me mercy!

1096
01:36:27,938 --> 01:36:32,067
Should have realized if Voldemort
didn't kill you, we would. Together!

1097
01:36:32,317 --> 01:36:34,361
No!

1098
01:36:35,863 --> 01:36:39,783
- Harry, this man...
- I know what he is.

1099
01:36:39,992 --> 01:36:41,869
But we'll take him to the castle.

1100
01:36:42,077 --> 01:36:47,124
- Bless you, boy. Bless you!
- Get off!

1101
01:36:48,292 --> 01:36:50,669
I said we'd take you to the castle.

1102
01:36:51,044 --> 01:36:53,255
After that,
the dementors can have you.

1103
01:36:57,176 --> 01:37:00,929
Sorry about the bite.
I reckon that twinges a bit.

1104
01:37:01,096 --> 01:37:04,600
A bit? A bit?
You almost tore my leg off!

1105
01:37:04,808 --> 01:37:06,351
I was going for the rat.

1106
01:37:06,518 --> 01:37:10,355
Normally, I have a very sweet
disposition as a dog.

1107
01:37:10,522 --> 01:37:15,736
More than once, James suggested
that I make the change permanent.

1108
01:37:15,944 --> 01:37:20,824
The tail I could live with.
But the fleas, they're murder.

1109
01:37:33,378 --> 01:37:34,880
Okay.

1110
01:37:39,885 --> 01:37:42,429
- You better go.
- No. Don't worry, okay?

1111
01:37:42,596 --> 01:37:43,972
It's fine. I'll stay.

1112
01:37:44,765 --> 01:37:46,725
You go, I'll stay.

1113
01:37:47,059 --> 01:37:50,145
- You okay?
- I'm fine. Go.

1114
01:37:51,772 --> 01:37:54,775
- That looks really painful.
- So painful.

1115
01:37:54,942 --> 01:37:57,486
They might chop it.

1116
01:37:57,986 --> 01:38:00,656
I'm sure Madam Pomfrey
will fix it in a heartbeat.

1117
01:38:00,823 --> 01:38:05,035
It's too late. It's ruined.
It'll have to be chopped off.

1118
01:38:06,286 --> 01:38:08,080
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1119
01:38:08,956 --> 01:38:12,709
I'll never forget the first time
I walked through those doors.

1120
01:38:13,418 --> 01:38:16,588
It'll be nice to do it again
as a free man.

1121
01:38:18,715 --> 01:38:21,552
That was a noble thing
you did back there.

1122
01:38:22,344 --> 01:38:24,471
He doesn't deserve it.

1123
01:38:24,680 --> 01:38:27,850
I didn't think my dad
would have wanted his best friends...

1124
01:38:28,016 --> 01:38:29,560
...to become killers.

1125
01:38:29,726 --> 01:38:33,397
Besides, dead,
the truth dies with him.

1126
01:38:33,605 --> 01:38:35,983
Alive, you're free.

1127
01:38:36,149 --> 01:38:39,236
Turn me into a flobberworm.
Anything but the dementors!

1128
01:38:39,444 --> 01:38:42,781
Ron! Haven't I been a good pet?
You won't let them give me...

1129
01:38:42,948 --> 01:38:45,409
...to the dementors, will you?
I was your rat!

1130
01:38:45,617 --> 01:38:49,663
- Sweet, clever girl! Surely you won't...
- Get away from her!

1131
01:38:52,124 --> 01:38:54,001
I don't know if you know, Harry...

1132
01:38:54,209 --> 01:38:58,297
...but when you were born, James
and Lily made me your godfather.

1133
01:38:58,463 --> 01:39:00,424
I know.

1134
01:39:01,592 --> 01:39:05,637
I can understand if you choose
to stay with your aunt and uncle...

1135
01:39:05,804 --> 01:39:08,265
...but if you ever wanted
a different home...

1136
01:39:08,473 --> 01:39:10,934
What? Come and live with you?

1137
01:39:12,269 --> 01:39:15,439
It's just a thought.
I can understand if you don't want to.

1138
01:39:15,647 --> 01:39:17,191
Harry!

1139
01:39:32,623 --> 01:39:36,293
Remus, my old friend.
Have you taken your potion tonight?

1140
01:39:37,628 --> 01:39:42,966
You know the man you truly are, Remus!
This heart is where you truly live! Here!

1141
01:39:44,301 --> 01:39:46,261
This flesh is only flesh!

1142
01:39:47,471 --> 01:39:49,515
<i>Expelliarmus!</i>

1143
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:01,193
Harry!

1144
01:40:02,277 --> 01:40:05,197
Remus! Remus!

1145
01:40:11,453 --> 01:40:13,747
Run! Run!

1146
01:40:23,799 --> 01:40:25,843
- Come on.
- Wait. Wait.

1147
01:40:26,009 --> 01:40:31,056
Hermione! Bad idea. Bad idea.

1148
01:40:31,265 --> 01:40:33,475
Professor?

1149
01:40:37,604 --> 01:40:39,147
Professor Lupin?

1150
01:40:46,905 --> 01:40:50,159
Nice doggy. Nice doggy!

1151
01:40:50,576 --> 01:40:53,120
There you are, Potter!

1152
01:41:26,904 --> 01:41:27,905
Sirius!

1153
01:41:28,780 --> 01:41:31,158
Come back here, Potter!

1154
01:42:37,015 --> 01:42:38,433
Sirius!

1155
01:42:39,226 --> 01:42:42,187
No. Sirius!

1156
01:43:24,062 --> 01:43:26,899
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1157
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:42,117
Harry?

1158
01:45:43,035 --> 01:45:45,412
I saw my dad.

1159
01:45:45,621 --> 01:45:47,164
What?

1160
01:45:47,372 --> 01:45:48,916
He sent the dementors away.

1161
01:45:49,082 --> 01:45:50,459
I saw him across the lake.

1162
01:45:50,667 --> 01:45:52,294
Harry, they've captured Sirius.

1163
01:45:52,544 --> 01:45:55,380
Any minute the dementors
are gonna perform the Kiss.

1164
01:45:55,547 --> 01:45:58,008
- They're gonna kill him?
- No. It's worse.

1165
01:45:58,258 --> 01:46:00,052
Much worse.

1166
01:46:00,260 --> 01:46:02,638
They're going to suck out his soul.

1167
01:46:04,348 --> 01:46:05,724
Headmaster, stop them.

1168
01:46:05,891 --> 01:46:09,228
- They've got the wrong man.
- It's true. Sirius is innocent.

1169
01:46:09,436 --> 01:46:11,647
- It's Scabbers who did it.
- Scabbers?

1170
01:46:11,813 --> 01:46:13,190
He's my rat, sir.

1171
01:46:13,607 --> 01:46:17,361
He's not really a rat. He was a rat.
He was my brother Percy's rat.

1172
01:46:17,611 --> 01:46:21,281
- But then they gave him an owl...
- The point is, we know the truth.

1173
01:46:21,490 --> 01:46:23,951
- Please believe us.
- I do, Miss Granger.

1174
01:46:24,201 --> 01:46:29,623
But the word of three 13-year-old
wizards will convince few others.

1175
01:46:32,709 --> 01:46:35,504
A child's voice,
however honest and true...

1176
01:46:35,671 --> 01:46:39,424
...is meaningless to those
who have forgotten how to listen.

1177
01:46:44,638 --> 01:46:47,182
Mysterious thing, time.

1178
01:46:48,350 --> 01:46:49,685
Powerful...

1179
01:46:49,852 --> 01:46:52,688
...and when meddled with,
dangerous.

1180
01:46:54,314 --> 01:46:57,901
Sirius Black is in the topmost
cell of the Dark Tower.

1181
01:46:58,735 --> 01:47:00,863
You know the laws, Miss Granger.

1182
01:47:01,029 --> 01:47:02,823
You must not be seen.

1183
01:47:02,990 --> 01:47:06,660
And you would do well, I feel,
to return before this last chime.

1184
01:47:06,827 --> 01:47:10,330
If not, the consequences
are too ghastly to discuss.

1185
01:47:10,914 --> 01:47:12,708
If you succeed tonight...

1186
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:15,711
...more than one innocent life
may be spared.

1187
01:47:17,546 --> 01:47:19,756
Three turns should do it, I think.

1188
01:47:24,636 --> 01:47:26,430
Oh, and by the way.

1189
01:47:26,638 --> 01:47:32,477
When in doubt, I find retracing
my steps to be a wise place to begin.

1190
01:47:32,644 --> 01:47:34,688
Good luck.

1191
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:37,691
What the bloody hell
was that all about?

1192
01:47:38,358 --> 01:47:40,652
Sorry, Ron, but seeing
as you can't walk...

1193
01:48:09,681 --> 01:48:11,308
What just happened?

1194
01:48:11,475 --> 01:48:13,769
- Where's Ron?
- 7:30.

1195
01:48:13,936 --> 01:48:15,812
Where were we at 7:30?

1196
01:48:15,979 --> 01:48:17,773
I don't know. Going to Hagrid's?

1197
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:20,317
Come on. And we can't be seen.

1198
01:48:21,401 --> 01:48:23,195
Hermione!

1199
01:48:41,421 --> 01:48:44,091
Hermione! Hermione, wait.

1200
01:48:45,884 --> 01:48:49,471
Hermione, will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?

1201
01:48:49,680 --> 01:48:52,516
You foul, loathsome,
evil little cockroach!

1202
01:48:52,683 --> 01:48:54,017
That's us.

1203
01:48:54,226 --> 01:48:57,145
Hermione, no! He's not worth it.

1204
01:48:57,354 --> 01:48:58,814
This is not normal.

1205
01:49:01,108 --> 01:49:03,485
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.

1206
01:49:03,652 --> 01:49:05,863
McGonagall gave it to me first term.

1207
01:49:06,029 --> 01:49:09,366
This is how I've been getting
to my lessons all year.

1208
01:49:09,575 --> 01:49:12,744
- You mean we've gone back in time?
- Yes.

1209
01:49:12,953 --> 01:49:16,290
Dumbledore obviously wanted us
to return to this moment.

1210
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:21,795
Clearly, something happened
he wants us to change.

1211
01:49:24,923 --> 01:49:26,258
Good punch.

1212
01:49:26,425 --> 01:49:27,926
Thanks.

1213
01:49:28,927 --> 01:49:30,554
Malfoy's coming.

1214
01:49:31,513 --> 01:49:33,807
- Run.
- Not a word to anyone, understood?

1215
01:49:34,308 --> 01:49:37,394
I'm gonna get that jumped-up
mudblood! Mark my words.

1216
01:49:37,561 --> 01:49:41,481
- That felt good.
- Not good, brilliant.

1217
01:49:42,858 --> 01:49:45,402
Come on. We should be at Hagrid's.

1218
01:50:04,588 --> 01:50:07,132
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.

1219
01:50:08,592 --> 01:50:10,469
Of course.

1220
01:50:10,636 --> 01:50:12,596
Remember what Dumbledore said?

1221
01:50:12,804 --> 01:50:16,850
If we succeed, more than one
innocent life could be spared.

1222
01:50:17,226 --> 01:50:18,560
Let's go.

1223
01:50:39,832 --> 01:50:41,959
Here they come. I'd better hurry.

1224
01:50:42,125 --> 01:50:44,586
Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him.

1225
01:50:44,795 --> 01:50:47,256
Otherwise, he'll think Hagrid
set him free.

1226
01:50:48,298 --> 01:50:50,676
Scabbers, you're alive!

1227
01:50:50,843 --> 01:50:53,595
- Keep a closer eye on your pet.
- That's Pettigrew.

1228
01:50:53,846 --> 01:50:56,765
- Harry, you can't.
- He betrayed my parents.

1229
01:50:56,932 --> 01:50:59,935
- You don't expect me to sit here.
- Yes, and you must!

1230
01:51:03,814 --> 01:51:06,525
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut now.

1231
01:51:06,692 --> 01:51:09,528
If you go bursting in,
you'll think you've gone mad.

1232
01:51:09,695 --> 01:51:12,531
Awful things happen to wizards
who meddle with time.

1233
01:51:12,739 --> 01:51:14,950
We can't be seen.

1234
01:51:18,287 --> 01:51:19,997
Fudge is coming.

1235
01:51:20,914 --> 01:51:22,958
And we aren't leaving?

1236
01:51:25,169 --> 01:51:26,712
Why aren't we leaving?

1237
01:51:37,681 --> 01:51:39,224
Are you mad?

1238
01:51:45,230 --> 01:51:46,607
That hurt.

1239
01:51:46,815 --> 01:51:48,150
Sorry.

1240
01:52:09,004 --> 01:52:11,673
We're coming out the back door. Go!

1241
01:52:29,066 --> 01:52:31,902
Is that really what my hair
looks like from the back?

1242
01:52:33,946 --> 01:52:35,280
What?

1243
01:52:36,156 --> 01:52:37,950
I thought I just saw...

1244
01:52:38,200 --> 01:52:40,869
- Never mind.
- Let's go.

1245
01:52:55,175 --> 01:52:57,469
Okay, go, Harry. Go!

1246
01:53:03,725 --> 01:53:05,686
Get away. Get off.

1247
01:53:27,875 --> 01:53:31,295
Minister, I really think
I should sign as well.

1248
01:53:32,129 --> 01:53:35,299
Yes, very well. Perhaps it would be...

1249
01:53:35,507 --> 01:53:39,261
Okay, Buckbeak. Come quickly.
Come with us now. Come on.

1250
01:53:43,765 --> 01:53:46,476
Keep trying. Come on. Quickly.

1251
01:53:48,854 --> 01:53:52,608
Buckbeak. Okay?
Quickly. Hurry up. Okay?

1252
01:53:53,484 --> 01:53:56,737
- Your name only.
- It's such a very long name...

1253
01:53:57,154 --> 01:53:58,864
Hurry up now, Buckbeak, okay?

1254
01:54:01,575 --> 01:54:04,536
Come on.
Come on, Buckbeak.

1255
01:54:04,745 --> 01:54:07,039
Come and get the nice dead ferret.

1256
01:54:09,666 --> 01:54:14,129
- Come on. It's here. Come on, Beaky.
- Here we are, minister. Follow me.

1257
01:54:14,379 --> 01:54:16,006
- Now, look there.
- Where?

1258
01:54:16,256 --> 01:54:19,593
- Look beyond the rocks.
- What am I supposed to see?

1259
01:54:19,801 --> 01:54:23,305
Professor Dippet had that ling
planted when he was headmaster.

1260
01:54:23,472 --> 01:54:26,308
- Oh, yes. Indeed, indeed.
- And all the strawberries.

1261
01:54:27,267 --> 01:54:30,145
- Come on, Buckbeak. Come on.
- I see no strawberries.

1262
01:54:30,312 --> 01:54:31,480
- Over there.
- Where?

1263
01:54:31,647 --> 01:54:33,357
- Over there.
- This way.

1264
01:54:33,607 --> 01:54:36,276
- Let's get this over, please.
- All right.

1265
01:54:37,945 --> 01:54:39,655
But where is it?

1266
01:54:40,572 --> 01:54:42,783
I saw the beast, just now.

1267
01:54:43,408 --> 01:54:45,619
- Not a moment ago!
- How extraordinary.

1268
01:54:45,786 --> 01:54:47,120
Buckbeak.

1269
01:54:47,329 --> 01:54:51,416
Come now, Dumbledore.
Someone's obviously released him.

1270
01:54:51,583 --> 01:54:52,918
- Hagrid?
- Buckbeak.

1271
01:54:53,126 --> 01:54:57,339
I don't think the minister's suggesting
you had anything to do with this.

1272
01:54:57,589 --> 01:55:00,425
How could you?
You've been with us all the time.

1273
01:55:00,592 --> 01:55:02,469
- Right.
- Well, well.

1274
01:55:02,636 --> 01:55:04,179
We must search the grounds.

1275
01:55:04,346 --> 01:55:07,349
Well, search the skies,
if you must, minister.

1276
01:55:07,558 --> 01:55:12,980
Meanwhile, I'd like a nice cup
of tea or a large brandy.

1277
01:55:13,147 --> 01:55:17,151
Oh, executioner, your services
are no longer required.

1278
01:55:17,317 --> 01:55:19,194
Thank you.

1279
01:55:19,403 --> 01:55:22,656
You'll find no small glasses
in this house, professor.

1280
01:55:33,458 --> 01:55:34,960
- Come on.
- This way.

1281
01:55:41,758 --> 01:55:43,552
This way, now.

1282
01:55:45,971 --> 01:55:47,681
- Now what?
- We save Sirius.

1283
01:55:47,931 --> 01:55:50,392
- How?
- No idea.

1284
01:55:59,735 --> 01:56:02,112
<i>- Look. It's Lupin.
- Immobulus!</i>

1285
01:56:08,535 --> 01:56:10,496
And Snape's coming.

1286
01:56:16,752 --> 01:56:18,378
And now we wait.

1287
01:56:19,630 --> 01:56:21,423
And now we wait.

1288
01:56:48,992 --> 01:56:52,246
- At least someone's enjoying himself.
- Yeah.

1289
01:56:55,040 --> 01:56:56,834
- Hermione?
- Yeah?

1290
01:56:57,000 --> 01:57:01,296
Before, down by the lake,
when I was with Sirius...

1291
01:57:01,505 --> 01:57:03,632
...I did see someone.

1292
01:57:03,799 --> 01:57:07,219
That someone
made the dementors go away.

1293
01:57:07,386 --> 01:57:08,720
With a Patronus.

1294
01:57:08,887 --> 01:57:10,764
I heard Snape telling Dumbledore.

1295
01:57:10,973 --> 01:57:12,432
According to him...

1296
01:57:12,599 --> 01:57:16,019
...only a really powerful wizard
could have conjured it.

1297
01:57:16,186 --> 01:57:18,063
It was my dad.

1298
01:57:19,189 --> 01:57:20,983
My dad conjured the Patronus.

1299
01:57:21,150 --> 01:57:23,360
- Harry, but your dad's...
- Dead. I know.

1300
01:57:24,820 --> 01:57:27,114
I'm just telling you what I saw.

1301
01:57:31,285 --> 01:57:32,911
Here we come.

1302
01:57:38,584 --> 01:57:40,961
You see Sirius talking to me there?

1303
01:57:41,128 --> 01:57:43,964
- He's asking me to come live with him.
- That's great.

1304
01:57:44,131 --> 01:57:47,467
When we free him, I'll never
have to go back to the Dursleys'.

1305
01:57:47,634 --> 01:57:49,261
It'll just be me and him.

1306
01:57:49,928 --> 01:57:51,889
We could live in the country...

1307
01:57:52,055 --> 01:57:54,683
...someplace you can see the sky.

1308
01:57:54,850 --> 01:57:57,686
He'll like that after
all those years in Azkaban.

1309
01:57:58,729 --> 01:58:00,272
Harry!

1310
01:58:01,815 --> 01:58:03,525
Run!

1311
01:58:10,407 --> 01:58:11,950
Let's go.

1312
01:58:31,512 --> 01:58:33,805
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life.

1313
01:58:38,101 --> 01:58:39,478
Thanks.

1314
01:58:41,313 --> 01:58:45,359
- Great. Now he's coming for us.
- Yeah, I didn't think about that. Run!

1315
02:00:00,475 --> 02:00:02,186
That was so scary.

1316
02:00:02,394 --> 02:00:05,314
Poor Professor Lupin's
having a really tough night.

1317
02:00:16,783 --> 02:00:19,870
Sirius. Come on!

1318
02:00:35,928 --> 02:00:38,055
- This is horrible.
- Don't worry.

1319
02:00:38,222 --> 02:00:41,391
My dad will come.
He'll conjure the Patronus.

1320
02:00:50,150 --> 02:00:51,944
Any minute now.

1321
02:00:52,194 --> 02:00:54,238
Right there. You'll see.

1322
02:00:55,614 --> 02:00:58,075
Harry, listen to me.
No one's coming.

1323
02:00:58,283 --> 02:01:00,828
Don't worry, he will.
He will come.

1324
02:01:04,957 --> 02:01:07,417
- Sirius.
- You're dying...

1325
02:01:09,461 --> 02:01:11,338
...both of you.

1326
02:01:13,423 --> 02:01:15,133
Harry!

1327
02:01:17,052 --> 02:01:20,889
<i>Expecto Patronum!</i>

1328
02:02:19,531 --> 02:02:21,116
You were right, Hermione.

1329
02:02:21,283 --> 02:02:24,620
It wasn't my dad I saw earlier.
It was me!

1330
02:02:24,786 --> 02:02:27,539
I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before.

1331
02:02:27,706 --> 02:02:30,083
I knew I could do it
this time because...

1332
02:02:30,250 --> 02:02:31,960
...well, I had already done it.

1333
02:02:32,127 --> 02:02:34,588
- Does that make sense?
- No.

1334
02:02:34,755 --> 02:02:37,591
But I don't like flying...!

1335
02:02:50,729 --> 02:02:52,064
<i>Bombarda!</i>

1336
02:03:25,389 --> 02:03:28,183
I'll be forever grateful for this...

1337
02:03:28,350 --> 02:03:29,685
...to both of you.

1338
02:03:29,852 --> 02:03:32,771
- I want to go with you.
- One day, perhaps.

1339
02:03:32,938 --> 02:03:35,858
For some time, my life
will be too unpredictable.

1340
02:03:36,024 --> 02:03:37,734
And besides...

1341
02:03:38,694 --> 02:03:41,947
...you're meant to be here.
- But you're innocent.

1342
02:03:42,156 --> 02:03:44,283
And you know it.

1343
02:03:45,367 --> 02:03:47,244
And for now, that will do.

1344
02:03:49,580 --> 02:03:52,124
I expect you're tired of hearing this...

1345
02:03:53,125 --> 02:03:55,669
...but you look so like your father.

1346
02:03:57,421 --> 02:03:59,381
Except your eyes.

1347
02:04:00,340 --> 02:04:02,634
- You have...
- My mother's eyes.

1348
02:04:04,595 --> 02:04:09,641
It's cruel that I spent so much time
with James and Lily, and you so little.

1349
02:04:10,267 --> 02:04:11,727
But know this:

1350
02:04:12,895 --> 02:04:16,064
The ones that love us
never really leave us.

1351
02:04:17,441 --> 02:04:19,401
And you can always find them...

1352
02:04:21,778 --> 02:04:23,655
...in here.

1353
02:04:34,041 --> 02:04:36,585
You really are the brightest
witch of your age.

1354
02:05:03,403 --> 02:05:05,030
We have to go.

1355
02:05:33,308 --> 02:05:35,978
- Well?
- He's free. We did it.

1356
02:05:36,145 --> 02:05:37,688
Did what?

1357
02:05:37,855 --> 02:05:39,815
Good night.

1358
02:05:48,574 --> 02:05:49,908
How did you get there?

1359
02:05:50,075 --> 02:05:52,744
I was talking to you there.
And now you're there.

1360
02:05:53,078 --> 02:05:55,706
- What's he talking about, Harry?
- I don't know.

1361
02:05:55,873 --> 02:05:59,376
Honestly, Ron. How can somebody
be in two places at once?

1362
02:06:25,903 --> 02:06:27,362
Hello, Harry.

1363
02:06:31,033 --> 02:06:32,826
I saw you coming.

1364
02:06:37,414 --> 02:06:40,125
I've looked worse, believe me.

1365
02:06:42,836 --> 02:06:46,006
- You've been sacked.
- No.

1366
02:06:46,173 --> 02:06:49,134
No. I resigned, actually.

1367
02:06:49,301 --> 02:06:51,094
Resigned? Why?

1368
02:06:51,261 --> 02:06:56,558
Well, it seems that somebody
let slip the nature of my condition.

1369
02:06:56,725 --> 02:07:02,231
This time tomorrow, the owls will start
arriving and parents will not want...

1370
02:07:02,397 --> 02:07:05,734
...well, someone like me
teaching their children.

1371
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:07,861
- But Dumbledore...
- He has already...

1372
02:07:08,070 --> 02:07:09,947
...risked enough on my behalf.

1373
02:07:10,113 --> 02:07:13,367
Besides, people like me are...

1374
02:07:13,992 --> 02:07:17,329
Well, let's just say
that I'm used to it by now.

1375
02:07:26,880 --> 02:07:29,424
Why do you look so miserable, Harry?

1376
02:07:29,633 --> 02:07:31,760
None of it made any difference.

1377
02:07:31,969 --> 02:07:35,472
- Pettigrew escaped.
- Didn't make any difference?

1378
02:07:35,681 --> 02:07:39,184
It made all the difference in the world.
You uncovered the truth.

1379
02:07:39,351 --> 02:07:41,812
You saved an innocent man
from a terrible fate.

1380
02:07:42,229 --> 02:07:44,690
It made a great deal of difference.

1381
02:07:49,361 --> 02:07:51,572
If I am proud of anything...

1382
02:07:51,738 --> 02:07:54,408
...it is of how much
you have learned this year.

1383
02:07:54,575 --> 02:07:57,327
Now, since I am no longer
your teacher...

1384
02:07:57,494 --> 02:08:01,707
...I feel no guilt whatsoever
about giving this back to you.

1385
02:08:02,666 --> 02:08:05,127
So now I'll say goodbye, Harry.

1386
02:08:05,335 --> 02:08:07,880
I feel sure we'll meet again sometime.

1387
02:08:08,463 --> 02:08:09,798
Until then...

1388
02:08:11,133 --> 02:08:12,843
...mischief managed.

1389
02:08:47,085 --> 02:08:51,298
Stand back, I said! Or I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle.

1390
02:08:51,465 --> 02:08:52,841
Harry.

1391
02:08:53,717 --> 02:08:55,093
Wherever did you get it?

1392
02:08:55,260 --> 02:08:57,638
Can I have a go, Harry?
After you, of course.

1393
02:08:57,846 --> 02:08:59,973
- What are you talking about?
- Quiet.

1394
02:09:00,182 --> 02:09:03,435
Let the man through.
I didn't mean to open it, Harry.

1395
02:09:03,644 --> 02:09:06,104
It was badly wrapped.
They made me do it.

1396
02:09:06,313 --> 02:09:07,773
Did not.

1397
02:09:09,191 --> 02:09:12,694
- It's a Firebolt.
- It's the fastest broom in the world.

1398
02:09:12,861 --> 02:09:14,404
For me?

1399
02:09:14,571 --> 02:09:17,115
- But who sent it?
- No one knows.

1400
02:09:17,282 --> 02:09:19,159
This came with it.

1401
02:09:24,039 --> 02:09:25,666
- Go on, Harry!
- Yeah, let's see.

1402
02:09:25,874 --> 02:09:27,668
How fast is it, Harry?

1403
02:09:47,062 --> 02:09:48,689
Lumos.

1404
02:09:48,856 --> 02:09:51,233
<i>I solemnly swear that I am
up to no good.</i>

1405
02:21:10,454 --> 02:21:12,247
Mischief managed.

1406
02:21:18,003 --> 02:21:19,463
<i>Nox.</i>
