Help me.

3
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,731
Somebody there?

4
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,526
I'm hurt.

5
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,521
Is somebody there?

6
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,406
Please.

7
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,367
I'm bleeding.

8
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,401
Help me.

9
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,526
Drop your weapon.

10
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,840
You drop yours first.

11
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,241
Drop it!

12
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,846
Okay.

13
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,366
Your turn.

14
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,201
Let me see your other hand.

15
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,050
If I move this hand,
I'm afraid my stomach will fall out.

16
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,324
I need to see your other hand.

17
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,728
- What's in your hand?
- Nothing.

18
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,647
Drop your weapon.

19
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,446
What's in your hand?

20
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,331
Oh.

21
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,883
<i>I miss the Cassie I was.</i>

22
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,446
Hey.

23
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,171
<i>A totally normal high school girl.</i>

24
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,526
- Hey! How you doing?
- Hi! Good.

25
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,965
- Cheers.
- Thank you. Cheers.

26
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,691
<i>I wonder what that Cassie
would think of me now.</i>

27
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,000
<i>The Cassie who kills.</i>

28
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,602
You know, he was supposed to be here.

29
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,806
Who?

30
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
Oh.

31
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,126
Why are the hot ones always so unreliable?

32
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,969
What would I even say to him?

33
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,520
I don't know him,
and he doesn't even know me.

34
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,364
You're a girl. He's a boy.

35
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,527
- Your parts go together.
- Don't.

36
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,726
Oh, God.

37
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,169
- Okay, Liz.
- What?

38
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,685
I'm gonna see you Monday.

39
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,404
- Oh.
- I gotta go home.

40
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,481
Skedaddle.

41
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,607
Okay.

42
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,007
- Honey, love you.
- I love you.

43
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,684
- Bye.
- Text me when you're home.

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,761
Okay.

45
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,521
Hey.

46
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,241
Hey.

47
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,930
Nice phone case.

48
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,491
What? You have something against pink?

49
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,643
No, no. I totally like it.

50
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,087
I'm just kidding.

51
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,810
Uh, this is actually my sister's phone.

52
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,487
I dropped her off at a sleepover,
and she took mine by mistake.

53
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,524
Mine's much cooler.

54
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,251
It's Spider-Man.

55
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,246
Polka dots.

56
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,161
Ah, that's her.

57
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,720
Hey.

58
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,762
Uh... Yeah, yeah, I have it.

59
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,560
No, I haven't looked at your text messages.

60
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,164
"Nice phone case"?

61
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,960
Right.

62
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,205
<i>I'm Captain Lochner.
This is Sergeant Nicolai.</i>

63
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,090
<i>- Hello.
- How do you do?</i>

64
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,969
<i>I'm sorry. No more coffee.</i>

65
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,090
<i>Miss Gray, do you know this gentleman?</i>

66
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,211
Sing me a song.

67
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,481
A song?

68
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,005
Okay, close your eyes.

69
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,244
<i>Bones sinking like stones</i>

70
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,891
<i>All that we fought for</i>

71
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,970
<i>I didn't know it then,</i>

72
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,289
<i>but that was the last
normal day of my life.</i>

73
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,362
<i>All of us are done for</i>

74
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,091
<i>When you're in high school,</i>

75
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,209
<i>just about everything
feels like the end of the world.</i>

76
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,280
Can you believe what happened?

77
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,481
No.

78
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,040
<i>An early curfew, a final exam...</i>

79
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,248
- Hey, Ben!
- Stop it.

80
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,526
<i>Soccer practise.</i>

81
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,882
Sullivan. What are we doing out here?

82
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,361
Why not just tell her
where you're gonna kick it?

83
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,965
Come on, let's go.

84
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,283
Hey, check it out. Look at this.
It's so freaky.

85
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,885
- Watch.
- I can't see anything.

86
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,530
Oh, my God, Altschuler.

87
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,410
That's it. You're done. Off the field.

88
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,448
No. But, look, it's really weird.

89
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,729
Off! Goodbye. <i>Adiós.</i>

90
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,240
- What's going on?
- Panthers, let's go! Hustle up!

91
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,408
Give me your phone.
Give me your phone.

92
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,970
Mine doesn't work!

93
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,280
- It totally just stopped.
- All right, Perkins.

94
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,640
<i>Turns out,</i>

95
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,087
<i>what we thought was the end of the world</i>

96
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,967
<i>wasn't.</i>

97
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,963
What, did someone famous die
or something?

98
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,964
<i>It appears to be metallic
and of a considerable size.</i>

99
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,608
<i>Across the world, social media has been
awash with panic and speculation</i>

100
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,762

101
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,649
<i>The president has authorised NASA</i>

<i>and is currently over the United States,

105
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,170
Oh, my God. It's right over us.

106
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,526
I wanna see!

107
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,404
- Hey.
- No, Sam. Wait.

108
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,084
Sam, wait!

109
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,400
- You can see it!
- Come here!

110
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,681
Look up there, hon.

111
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,922
- Wait, what is that?
- I have no idea.

112
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,323
<i>There were no messages
from our galactic party crashers</i>

113
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,970
<i>during the first 10 days.</i>

114
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,371
<i>But pretty soon, they had a name.</i>

115
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,885
<i>We called them "the Others."</i>

116
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,769
The Wilsons are leaving, too?

117
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,840
They say they don't feel safe
so close to the city.

118
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,926
Okay.

119
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,127
Is this everyone?

120
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
Well, okay.

121
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,848
Everybody look at the
equation on the board.

122
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,166
Who can give me the derivative of X?

123
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,760
Anybody?

124
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,007
Anyone?

125
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,681
What...

126
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,209
I'm sure this is just a power outage.

127
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,281
My phone's not working.

128
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,442
What's going on?

129
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,681
Over here.

130
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,921
What on Earth?

131
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,563
My goodness. What's going on?

132
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Look at that!

133
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,966
Back up! Back up!

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,446
<i>The Others hit us

135

<i>that killed all the power on the planet.</i>

136
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,289
<i>No more engines.</i>

137

<i>No more everything we took for granted.</i>

140
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,366
<i>That was the last time I saw Ben Parish.</i>

141
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,680
<i>I guess he's dead now.</i>

142
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,722
Like everyone else in that room.

143
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,884
Here, Sam. Grab me another, okay?
Thank you.

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,729
<i>That was the 1st Wave.</i>

<i>At the time, we thought that was it.</i>

146
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,441
<i>Then the 2nd Wave hit.</i>

147
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,449
Come on, Sam. It's an earthquake!

148
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,246

- Watch out!

149
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,204
- Cassie!
- Come on!

150
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,930
Go! Go! It's okay!

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,206
Cassie!

152
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,525
It's okay. It's okay.

153
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,611
Just keep your head down, okay?

154
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,561
What's that noise?

155
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,807
Sam, run!

156
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,971
- Go!
- Cassie!

157
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,726
Go on!

158
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,481
Cassie!

159
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,164
- Cassie! Hurry!
- I'm okay. Just climb!

160
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,044
- Go, Sam! Go!
- Cassie!

161
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,247
Come here. Hold on to me.

162
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,044

<i>every island,</i>

168
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,447
<i>gone.</i>

169
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,411
<i>There are over
300 billion birds in the world.</i>

170
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,244
<i>That's 75 birds for every person.</i>

171
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,800
<i>Mom said the avian flu was already
one of the world's deadliest viruses.</i>

172
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,446
<i>In the 3rd Wave, the Others modified it.</i>

173
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,043
<i>Made it unstoppable.</i>

174
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,080
<i>And the birds spread it across the planet.</i>

175
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:47,165
Line A. Line A is for those
who have already been assessed.

176
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,242
If you're waiting to be assessed,
then proceed to Line B.

177
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,967
No pedal pulse,
no brachial, nothing.

178
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,081
Sit down, sir. Thank you.

179
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,120
Just head straight on back.

180
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,449
I ain't happy over here.

181
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,931
I feel fine!

182
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,447
I should be on the area
that isn't quarantined!

183
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,766
Hey, Liz!

184
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,249
- Hey.
- Your mom said you were here.

185
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,561
- Cassie! Cassie.
- Mom?

186
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,721
What are you...

187
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,926
She's quarantined.

188
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,209
- It's okay. I didn't even touch her.
- It is not okay. You can't be here.

189
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,045
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,727
Sweetheart, I need you to go home
and look after Sammy, okay?

191
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,086
But, Mom, I wanna help you here.

192
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,851
- I know. Can you get her out of here now?
- I wanna help.

193
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,767
- Mom.
- No, it's okay. Just go.

194
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,841
Miss, you gotta leave. Let's go.

195
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,369
- Quarantine six.
- In six.

196
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,366
<i>Some people
were immune to the virus.</i>

197
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:56,407
<i>And a few people got sick
and somehow recovered.</i>

198
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,490
<i>But most people didn't.</i>

199
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,121
Hey.

200
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,768
You can't wear those shoes.

201
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,328
Why don't they just get it over with?

202
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,765
What do they want?

203
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,880
I think a better question is,
"What do they need?"

204
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,650
They've been very careful so far

205
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:36,122
not to damage it
any more than absolutely necessary.

206
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,287
Damage what?

207
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,847
Earth.

208
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,131
I think that's why they're here, Cassie.

209
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,645
They need the Earth.

210
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,325
But not us.

211
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,846
No, not us.

212
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,084
Ready to walk for a while, Sammy?

213
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,366
Yeah.

214
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,487
Okay.

215
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,807
Dad, how far is it
to the refugee camp?

216
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,850
Just a few miles.
We should be there by nightfall.

217
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,009
- Dad, look. Is this it?
- Yeah, buddy. I think so.

218
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,049
Hey. Welcome.

219
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,963
Thanks. Hi.

220
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,530
Name's Hutchfield.

221
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,881
Hi. See ya.

222
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,086
Let me show you around.

223
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,523
Latrines are off to the left.

224
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,483
Farm is out that way.

225
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,730
You got fresh water?

226
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,848
Yeah. Not too bad, huh?

227
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,285
How many people are there here?

228
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,442
I don't know how many we got now.

229
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,645
305, something like that.

230
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,249
Dining hall over here.

231
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,209
When's the last time you had a hot meal?

232
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,765
Good. Well, maybe you can
walk me through it.

233
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,325
Here we draw a purple hat.

234
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,080
Can we get some water over here?

235
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,001
- Whoa, Dad.
- This is a Colt .45.

236
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,880
Okay?

237
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,042
This button changes out the clip.

238
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,960
That's loaded.

239
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,125
All right? Safety on.

240
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,406
Safety off.

241
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,846
Listen to me.

242
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,968
You're gonna carry this
with you at all times,

243
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,963
you're not gonna tell anybody you have it,

244
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,884
and you're only gonna use it
if it's life or death. You got it?

245
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,764
I thought we were safe here.

246
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,681
Pumpkin, there's nothing safe any more.

247
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,125
Here, you wanna put it
in the basket?

248
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,247
Okay.

249
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,008
- Here. Take this one.
- Okay.

250
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,330
You gotta get the weeds, guys.

251
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,965
What was that?

252
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,761
Sam, come here.

253
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,285
- What is that?
- I don't know. Come on.

254
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,407
Asher, come on!

255
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,527
Mommy!

256
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,006
Dad!

257
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,885
What is that?

258
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,284
- You see Dad?
- Dad!

259
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,885
- Cassie?
- Hey, Dad.

260
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,121
Hey.

261
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,320
- What's going on?
- All right, just take it easy.

262
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,290
I thought the cars didn't work.

263
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,804
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, I am Colonel Vosch
of the United States Army.</i>

264
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,843
<i>My men and I are from
the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.</i>

265
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,601
<i>We're here to help.</i>

266
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,489
It's about time.

267
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,925
<i>Let's get you people out of here.</i>

268
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,560
- Heck, yeah!
- Thank you.

269
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,601
Yes!

270
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,006
U.S.A.!

271
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,089
We should be ready to go
at a moment's notice, all right?

272
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,571
Stay with your sister, Sam.

273
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,681
- Come on.
- You can go right on the bus.

274
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,008
<i>Adults, please
move to the mess hall for a briefing.</i>

275
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,962
<i>Children, please move
to the buses for transport.</i>

276
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,611
We're right behind you. Be good!

277
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,524
<i>Adults, please move to the mess hall
for a briefing.</i>

278
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,008
Do you think they have electricity
if the trucks are working?

279
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,401
I don't know. Why, you still have a phone?

280
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,606
Yeah.

281
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,009
- You have a charger?
- Of course, yeah.

282
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,206
- Whoa, whoa, sir, sir.
- Yeah?

283
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,931
My orders are to get
just the kids onto the bus.

284
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,120
Well, those might be your orders,
but they're my kids.

285
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,730
- Yeah.
- So we're gonna stay together.

286
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,802
- We'll wait for another bus.
- It's okay, Private.

287
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,686
I got this.

288
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,203
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

289
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:15,726
Look, you're welcome to keep 'em here
with you if you want,

290
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,802
but if they were my kids,
I'd get 'em on that bus.

291
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,161
Why?

292
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,561
We have reason to believe there's an
imminent threat to this location.

293
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,760
We're trying to get everyone to safety
as quickly as we can,

294
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,404
and this is the only
working transpo we've got,

295
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,960
so we're taking shifts based on need.

296
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,528
Kids first, then we come back
for the rest of ya.

297
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,203
Well, how safe is it at Wright-Patterson?

298
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,249
Safest place there is right now.

299
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
And the buses will just come right back?

300
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,687
Dad, no.

301
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,444
Drop 'em off, come right back.

302
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,088
Like I said, it's your call.

303
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,441
Just 'cause some man in uniform
tries to tell us what to do

304
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,443
doesn't mean we actually have to
follow his orders.

305
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,249
Okay, I want you on this one, all right?

306
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,731
- I'll be right behind you.
- We can't split up.

307
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,440
And we're gonna have dinner tonight.
We're going to the same place.

308
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,480
- Dad, no.
- Cassie.

309
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,922
It's the Army, okay? This is our Army.
It's fine. It's gonna be okay.

310
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,081
- Don't leave me alone.
- All right. Come here.

311
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,806
I love you.

312
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,327
Take care of your brother.
All right? Come here.

313
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,442
I want you to listen to your sister,
all right?

314
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,521
- Okay.
- She's in charge.

315
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,880
- Okay?
- Dad.

316
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,966
Go ahead.

317
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,085
I'll be there before you know it.

318
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,682
Here, head to the back, Sam.

319
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,606
All right.

320
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,081
All right.

321
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,762
- Come here. Give me your backpack.
- Bear!

322
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,080
- What?
- Cassie, I forgot Bear!

323
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,730
- Cassie.
- What? Sam, what?

324
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,529
- I forgot Bear! I need to go get him!
- Sam, stop. Sit down.

325
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,410
- It's okay. What's up?
- I can't. I can't go without him.

326
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,206
Please!

327
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,881
All right, all right, all right, all right.
I'll go get him, okay?

328
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,042
Just stay here. All right?

329
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,610
- I'll be right back.
- Promise?

330
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,681
Yeah, I'll be right back. I promise.

331
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,127
Right, no, I think you're right.

332
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
Just grab whatever you can
get up in a box and carry it.

333
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:10,046
This way. Down to the mess hall.
In the mess hall now, please.

334
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,566
Come on, Sam.

335
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:19,006
Bear, Bear, Bear. Bear, Bear, Bear, Bear.

336
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,090
Oh, God. Sam!

337
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,761
Hey! Wait!

338
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,281
Stop!

339
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,965
Sam!

340
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,168
Cassie! Wait, stop!

341
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,049
Sam! No! Sam, wait!

342
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,686
Sam!

343
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,962
Cassie! Come on!

344
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,281
Cassie!

345
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:46,801
Sam!

346
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,526
No!

347
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,241
Cassie, no, no.

348
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,081
No!

349
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,801
No.

350
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,086
Shi...

351
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,363
Can I have your attention, please?

352
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,644
If you'll all just quiet down.

353
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,566
We believe the 4th Wave has begun.

354
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,085
The Others have come down off their ship.

355
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,928
They are moving among us.

356
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,722
Apparently, they have the ability
to inhabit human hosts

357
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,610
and control their actions.

358
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,126
- So, they look like humans?
- That's correct.

359
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,401
Where are they?

360
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,644
They could be anywhere.

361
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:36,441
What we do know is they have snipers
in these woods,

362
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,763
and they are targeting survivors.

363
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,285
We've got intel that would suggest

364
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,091
some of them could be right here
in this very camp.

365
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:48,365
So, what...
Are you saying that some of us are Others?

366
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,681
Please.
There's a lot we still don't know.

367
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:52,444
We can detect them in children.

368
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,806
Unfortunately, the screening procedure
for adults is a bit more complicated.

369
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,041
What about our kids?

370
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,326
Yeah, what about our kids?

371
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,371
I know. I know you all wanna
get back to your families.

372
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,407
Unfortunately, we're gonna have to
move you all to a secure holding facility

373
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,648
so they can run some screening protocols.

374
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,085
Folks, please!

375
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,404
You need to understand, there is no way
to differentiate us from the Others

376
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,847
without a comprehensive screening process.

377
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,604
The sooner we get you screened,

378
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,364
the sooner we can get you back
to your families.

379
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,487
This is bullshit!

380
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,166
I am not an Other, okay?
I'm not going anywhere.

381
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,160
Sir, no one's saying that you are.

382
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,290
This is the reality of our situation.

383
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,331
Now if you'd just calm down.

384
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,442
Please, just calm down.

385
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,851
Let me out of here.
Get out of my way. Watch out.

386
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,684
- Hold on, sir.
- Wait. Hey.

387
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,808
- Back it up. Now.
- Stop right there.

388
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,882
- Sir, drop your weapon.
- Step aside, now.

389
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,405
- Sir, drop your weapon.
- Drew, no!

390
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,851
You can't keep me in here!

391
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,605
- Everybody, just calm down!
- Let me out now!

392
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,927
Lower the weapon. Now.

393
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,968
- I wanna see my kids!
- Put it down!

394
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,441
Let me out of here!

395
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,010
No! Drew, stop!

396
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,806
Stay down!

397
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,167
Run!

398
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,843
No, no, no.

399
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,762
Hey, Dad?

400
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,691
Daddy.

401
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,841
I'm sorry.

402
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,251
I'm sorry.

403
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,926
Daddy.

404
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,764
I need my dad.

405
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,961
God!

406
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,803
<i>Security teams, clear zones three and four.</i>

407
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,202
<i>Security teams, clear zones three and four.</i>

408
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:14,484
<i>Support team members,
meet arrivals on the tarmac.</i>

409
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,651
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

410
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,887
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

411
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,166
<i>Number 127.</i>

412
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,961
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

413
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,807
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

414
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,444
<i>295.</i>

What's your name?

425
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,440
Ben Parish.

426
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,082
They called me "Zombie" in quarantine.

427
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,246
Any family not known to be dead?

428
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,321
No.

429
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,923
Sister died in the quakes.

430
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,210
Mom and Dad killed by the virus.

431
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,365
But it didn't kill you, did it?

432
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,727
Not quite.

433
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,002
That where the nickname came from?

434
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,487
You fought it off.

435
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,250
Yeah, lucky me.

436
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,050
Is this your sister's?

437
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,121
Yeah.

438
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,404
Well, lucky you.

439
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,967
You get to help avenge her death.

440
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,530
This puts out a signal that we can track.

441
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,281
You kids are the most important thing
right now.

442
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,690
We need every one of you
to help us fight the Others.

443
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:34,642
This isn't summer camp, Zombie.
You're a soldier now.

444
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,567
So we don't wanna lose you. Stand up.

445
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,811
Turn around.

446
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,888
Take a deep breath.

447
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,481
You all right?

448
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,160
How are we supposed to fight the Others
if we don't even know what they are?

449
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,090
Actually, we do.

450
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,610
You wanna see one?

451
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,690
Don't worry. He won't be able to see us.

452
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,850
I know. It's impossible to tell.

453
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,965
Look through here.

454
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,527
Look.

455
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,329
That's its true form.

456
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:55,169
The Others infest real humans
like some sort of parasite.

457
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:58,485
Take over their minds, their bodies.

458
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:03,125
Drugs, radiation, surgery, nothing works.

459
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,771
The only way to kill 'em
is to kill the host.

460
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,764
He's already dead.

461
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,844
You just need to
destroy the thing inside him.

462
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:20,525
The thing that did this.

463
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,611
Push the button.

464
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,086
Look again!

465
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,881
Look!

466
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,968
If you're gonna be on my squad,

467
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,442
I need to know that
you will do whatever it takes to...

468
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,765
Welcome to the fight.

469
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,642
<i>Here's how you kill off a species.</i>

470
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,729
<i>First, you take out the easy ones,
the weak, the exposed.</i>

471
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,686
<i>Kill them as efficiently as possible.</i>

472
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,362
<i>That was the first three Waves.</i>

473
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,441
<i>But even if you bug bomb a house,
there's always a few cockroaches left.</i>

474
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,801
<i>Now, we are like those cockroaches.</i>

475
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,647
<i>And the Others are picking us off.</i>

476
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,051
<i>One by one.</i>

477
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,566
<i>And because the Others look like us,</i>

478
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,850
<i>we can't trust anyone.</i>

479
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,768
<i>Eighty miles to Wright-Patterson.</i>

480
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,564
<i>I'm coming, Sammy.</i>

481
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,641
<i>I promise.</i>

482
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,804
<i>How do you rid
the world of humans?</i>

483
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,211
Help me.

484
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,643
<i>First, you rid the humans
of their humanity.</i>

485
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,046
Shit.

486
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,290
Shi... Shi...

487
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,441
God!

488
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,081
Sam.

489
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,130
All right. All right.

490
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,361
God!

491
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:32,044
I'm sorry, Sam.

492
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,725
<i>When I was a child,
I spoke as a child.</i>

493
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,884
I thought and I reasoned as a child.

494
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,969
But when I became a man,

495
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,850
I put away childish things.

496
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,610
Those words never meant more to me
than they do right now,

497
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,883
looking at all of you.

498
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,048
Our hope. Our future.

499
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,371
The best and brightest vision of who we are
and what we're fighting for.

500
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:13,721
Our intelligence tells us the Others are
readying themselves for a final attack.

501
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,408
The 5th Wave.

502
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:21,969
What form it will take, we do not know.

503
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,164
If they are successful,

504
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,764
there will be no more Waves.

505
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,930
No more conflicts.

506
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:35,921
Humanity as we know it will be wiped
from the face of the Earth.

507
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,881
Now.

508
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,762
I'm gonna tell you some things I know.

509
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:47,927
This is our world.

510
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:50,610
<i>It is our home.</i>

511
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,603
They will not overrun it.

512
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,606
They will not possess it.

513
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,282
So with whatever time we have left,

514
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:06,523
you will learn to think, speak,
move and fight like the soldiers you are.

515
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,040
Look out! A raid!

516
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,686
Go!

517
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,201
Fire!

518
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,488
Let the weight of our loss fuel you.

519
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,686
Let the weight of our dead embolden you.

520
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,480
Your right! On your right!

521
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,803
Let the weight of our hope
drive you to victory.

522
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,481
Can you do that?

523
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,120
All right. Hold!

524
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,688
Soldiers! Can you do that?

525
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,171
Sir, yes, sir!

526
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,127
Zombie!

527
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:39,611
- Get down!
- It's a booby trap!

528
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,486
Can you do that?

529
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,244
Sir, yes, sir!

530
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,081
Good.

531
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:52,886
Come on.

532
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:55,687
Where's my gun? Where's my gun?

533
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:56,966
Where is it?

534
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,325
I know you're awake.

535
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:33,681
Cassie?

536
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,322
How the hell do you know my name?

537
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,841
Your driver's license.

538
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,126
I'm Evan.

539
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:43,801
Evan Walker.

540
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:46,641
Where am I?

541
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,604
You were bleeding on the highway.
I brought you back here to my house.

542
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:52,920
Where's my gun?

543
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:56,047
All right, when you found me on
the highway, I had my gun. Where is it?

544
00:48:56,360 --> 00:48:58,203
I didn't see any gun.

545
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:04,766
What did you do?

546
00:49:05,240 --> 00:49:06,366
Your leg, Cassie.

547
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,408
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't...
- Your leg.

548
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,686
Jesus.

549
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,366
Oh, God.

550
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,445
Put your leg over here.

551
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,050
- This is gonna hurt.
- All right. Just do it. Just do it.

552
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:34,051
Oh, God.

553
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:41,486
Okay.

554
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,562
Oh, God.

555
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,371
How long have I been here?

556
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,041
About a week.

557
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:00,161
Oh, God.

558
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,603
How far is Wright-Patterson from here?

559
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,730
The military base?

560
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,368
Uh, about 60 miles.

561
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,926
Why?

562
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:19,641
Jesus!

563
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:30,929
Hey. It's okay.

564
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:33,528
- You're safe here.
- No.

565
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:36,604
All right, we're not
safe anywhere any more.

566
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,921
Why did you wanna know
how close Wright-Patterson was?

567
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:42,961
Uh...

568
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,081
It's my brother.

569
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,170
The Army took him there, so I...

570
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,086
I need to get him back.

571
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,201
What?

572
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,366
You should eat.

573
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,043
You gotta get your strength back.

574
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,328
Why'd you bring me here?

575
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,284
What do you want?

576
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,811
My family.

577
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,410
I couldn't save them,

578
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,410
but I could save you.

579
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:22,484
The way everything's happened,
I guess it just makes me feel more...

580
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,651
Human.

581
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,243
And you need help with that?

582
00:51:33,120 --> 00:51:34,565
Feeling human?

583
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:37,326
Don't you?

584
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,526
Maybe.

585
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,929
- You're cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

586
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,525
Don't you tell him my card.

587
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,051
You hear me, Oompa?

588
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:11,728
Hey, I've been getting pretty lucky,
and this isn't my first time playing.

589
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,805
By the way, I heard the new guy coming in
got kicked out of their last squad.

590
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:17,042
- For what?
- Disciplinary issues.

591
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,245
That true, boss?

592
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,721
That's what they say.

593
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,881
What's his name?

594
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:25,405
The name's Ringer.

595
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,281
And he is a she.

596
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,925
Bunk's over there.

597
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:40,289
Did you ever do karate before?

598
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,407
No.

599
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,811
Sure looks like you did.

600
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,761
You Zombie?

601
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:54,921
Yeah.

602
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,488
I was the leader of my last squad.

603
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:00,926
No doubt.

604
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,964
So the guy I replace went Section 8. Why?

605
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,841
Does it matter?

606
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,410
I heard it's 'cause this squad's so bad

607
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,767
he was afraid you'd get him killed
when the 5th Wave hits.

608
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:20,001
Uh-huh. It's your squad, too, now.

609
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,807
Hey!

610
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:27,403
Keep staring at my ass

611
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,405
and I'll rip your throats out.

612
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,725
Let's be clear.

613
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,486
I'm not taking orders from you.
I'm not gonna die with you geniuses.

614
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:39,605
Good to know.

615
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,883
If anyone in this barrack touches me,
I'll kill them.

616
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,761
Got it?

617
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:56,121
Anything else?

618
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,371
I like to play chess. Do you play?

619
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:01,240
No, actually.

620
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,205
But if you wanna play
some strip poker later on...

621
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,362
- Ha!
- Oh, shit!

622
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:10,326
And no demeaning, sexist remarks.

623
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,601
She's cool.

624
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:46,761
Quiet.

625
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,881
You had my gun the whole time!
Why'd you lie?

626
00:57:19,960 --> 00:57:21,928
I was afraid you'd shoot me.

627
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,442
For all I knew, you were an Other.

628
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,760
Yeah, well...

629
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:37,644
Was he one? Out there?

630
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:38,721
Yeah.

631
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,690
The woods are full of 'em.

632
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:44,765
They're using those drones
to hunt down survivors.

633
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:50,963
He looked so human that...

634
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,484
Oh, God. I gotta get Sam.

635
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,561
Cassie.

636
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,401
Rallying points,
places like Wright-Patterson,

637
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,890
they're obvious targets.

638
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,567
You think that Sammy's already dead?

639
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:25,763
I'm sorry, Cassie.

640
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,249
You're wrong, Evan.

641
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,810
All right? He's alive.

642
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:43,044
He's alive, and I'm gonna go get him.

643
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,161
Cassie.

644
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:00,290
I'm going with you.

645
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,681
You're not gonna make it very far
on your own.

646
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,244
You know what? Screw you, Evan.

647
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:12,288
- Okay? I don't need you. I don't need anyone.
- Cassie, come on.

648
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,606
- If you go, I'll just follow you.
- Actually, no.

649
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,205
If I need someone to carve a cane for me...

650
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,527
You can't stop me.
How are you gonna stop me?

651
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,886
I don't know. Maybe I'll shoot you!

652
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,042
What, like you shot that guy
with the crucifix?

653
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,530
What, you read my journal?

654
00:59:27,800 --> 00:59:30,451
- I didn't think you were gonna live.
- Don't touch me!

655
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:34,846
I'm sorry.

656
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,250
I'll get you there.

657
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,687
I can't promise what you'll find,
but I will get you there.

658
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,205
We leave in the morning.

659
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:50,684
This is a waste of time.

660
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,607
Go ahead and try it again.

661
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:56,729
Those kids are gonna be dead
before their boots hit the ground.

662
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,451
Especially with you as squad leader.

663
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,124
You don't know anything about me.

664
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,124
Let me guess.

665
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,128
You did good in school,
had a bunch of friends.

666
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,531
You probably played football.

667
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:15,046
You might have even been team captain.

668
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,725
Life was easy.

669
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,648
And then, all of a sudden, it wasn't.

670
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:23,803
No more games to win.

671
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,490
No one to get weak-kneed
at that pretty smile.

672
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:30,404
You weren't ready for the end of world.

673
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:32,846
And you were?

674
01:00:33,960 --> 01:00:35,450
I know how to survive.

675
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:39,127
And I was doing fine out there on my own.

676
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,328
Till they forced me
onto their stupid school bus.

677
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,004
They were rescuing us.

678
01:00:43,080 --> 01:00:45,924
We didn't get rescued, dumb-ass.
We got drafted.

679
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,126
Good, good.

680
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:49,721
Try it again.

681
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,850
How about this?

682
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,524
I take you down,

683
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:08,880
you teach us how to shoot.

684
01:01:09,360 --> 01:01:10,521
And when you don't?

685
01:01:11,560 --> 01:01:12,846
I stop asking.

686
01:01:13,200 --> 01:01:14,201
Deal.

687
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:18,926
Cute necklace. Girlfriend or sister?

688
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,650
Sister.

689
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,967
You're too sentimental.

690
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,125
Can you teach me that thing
where you took the gun out of my hand?

691
01:01:58,800 --> 01:02:02,407
Let's just leave
any potential disarming to me,

692
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:03,480
- all right?
- No.

693
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,284
No, I need to be ready.

694
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,564
Cassie, it's okay.

695
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,401
You don't have to be tough all the time.

696
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,642
Don't do that.

697
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:15,809
I'm not tough, okay?

698
01:02:18,120 --> 01:02:21,806
I promised Sam that I would be
there for him no matter what.

699
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,802
I made that promise to him.

700
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:31,847
Okay.

701
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,126
Give me your gun.

702
01:02:45,480 --> 01:02:46,527
Get up.

703
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:51,691
Point it at my chest.

704
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,126
Okay. Grab the barrel of the gun
with your left,

705
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,601
and with your right, snap my hand away.

706
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:01,161
You got it?

707
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,371
Hey, you're not gonna hurt me. All right.

708
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,204
Like that, but stronger.

709
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:12,487
Good.

710
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:17,488
Now at the end, you'll grab my wrist
and pull it toward you.

711
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:25,130
- Like that?
- Yeah.

712
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,886
Good job.

713
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:29,131
Well, thanks.

714
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:36,085
Can I have...

715
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:51,571
Okay.
Don't be so scared of your weapon.

716
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,648
You gotta think that the
gun is a part of you.

717
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,008
Not the gun firing, you firing.

718
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,601
Try it again.

719
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,282
Well, that wasn't terrible.

720
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,771
Zombie, the Colonel wants to see you, now.

721
01:04:45,640 --> 01:04:47,600
Could be. Seems like a good target.

722
01:04:48,640 --> 01:04:49,801
Be right back.

723
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:52,490
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

724
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:01,883
Simultaneous attacks
on the last of our metropolitan areas.

725
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,006
A full-on invasion. This is it.

726
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,766
The 5th Wave.

727
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:09,480
It's started?

728
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:12,001
Yeah.

729
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,284
Here, I want to show you something.

730
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,403
These employ the same technology
as the detector viewer from medical.

731
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,565
We've improved it. Made it mobile.

732
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,729
The idea is to allow our
soldiers in the field

733
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:26,167
to instantly differentiate
between friend and foe.

734
01:05:27,360 --> 01:05:30,204
You look at the enemy through this
and it lights 'em up green.

735
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:33,162
We can see them
before they know they've been seen.

736
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:35,009
We take back the advantage.

737
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:39,607
The only thing left to do now is
test the optics in live conditions.

738
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,810
Which is why tomorrow at 2100,

739
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:44,400
I'm sending four squads
into battle equipped with these helmets.

740
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:47,610
Your squad will be among those four.

741
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:50,407
Yes, sir.

742
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,164
Make me proud, son.

743
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:55,961
Bring that squad back in one piece.

744
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,406
Yes, sir.

745
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,401
Evan?

746
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:07,363
- Morning.
- Morning.

747
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,088
- Who've we got here?
- Um...

748
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:20,769
This is Lizbeth.

749
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:22,649
She's my best friend.

750
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:25,968
She looks like she's funny.

751
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:31,088
Yeah. Actually, you know, she was...

752
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:33,484
She was really funny.

753
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:37,928
- And this guy.
- He's nobody.

754
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,889
This must be Ben Parish.

755
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:44,601
- Oh, God.
- Wow.

756
01:07:45,760 --> 01:07:48,604
I really wish you hadn't read my journal.

757
01:07:49,560 --> 01:07:51,324
It's really embarrassing.

758
01:07:54,280 --> 01:07:55,850
Is that your family?

759
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:57,566
Yeah.

760
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:03,685
And that must be Sam.

761
01:08:04,280 --> 01:08:05,281
Yeah.

762
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:10,171
I can't wait to meet him.

763
01:08:16,680 --> 01:08:19,490
- We should probably get moving.
- Yeah.

764
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:32,451
All right, this way.

765
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:35,449
How do you know without a compass?

766
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,567
Do you have a compass?

767
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:38,644
No. But...

768
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,648
You know, I can make one out of a pin
and a glass of water.

769
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:48,044
Didn't peg you for a Girl Scout.

770
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:49,891
What'd you peg me as?

771
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:51,641
A cheerleader?

772
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:53,324
You said it, not me.

773
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,165
I've never been a huge fan of the outdoors.

774
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:58,810
Too many bugs.

775
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,723
You live on a farm.

776
01:09:00,800 --> 01:09:02,006
Accident of birth.

777
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:05,371
I had a scholarship to Kent State.

778
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:07,604
Mechanical engineering.

779
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,405
Thought I was some hick, huh?

780
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:12,881
You said it, not me.

781
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:51,690
Zombie, are they
really sending us to fight?

782
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:52,761
Yeah.

783
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:54,601
I'm scared.

784
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:56,606
It's okay.

785
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,164
Just go to sleep, all right?

786
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,328
What was your name before?

787
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:10,806
Ben.

788
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,246
What was yours?

789
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:16,040
Sam.

790
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:18,968
But my sister called me Sams.

791
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,563
When I couldn't sleep

792
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,122
she would sing to me.

793
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,129
<i>Bones sinking like stones</i>

794
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,204
<i>All that we fought for</i>

795
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:37,570
<i>Homes, places we've grown</i>

796
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,246
<i>All of us are done for</i>

797
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:41,890
Could you guys please shut up?

798
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:46,403
<i>We live in a beautiful world</i>

799
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,288
<i>Yeah, we do
Yeah, we do</i>

800
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:54,406
<i>We live in a beautiful world</i>

801
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:13,685
Hey. Let me help you.

802
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,850
Yeah, sure.

803
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:21,209
- Looks better.
- Yeah.

804
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:31,121
- Let me do this.
- All right.

805
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,962
- Got scissors?
- Yeah.

806
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:43,051
I got it.

807
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,363
- I should probably cover our stuff.
- Evan.

808
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,405
Thank you.

809
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,801
- Squad 53?
- Present and accounted for.

810
01:12:49,880 --> 01:12:50,927
All right.

811
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,570
Strap in. Take us up.

812
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,487
Where's Nugget?

813
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,045
Food poisoning.

814
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,646
Zombie.

815
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,281
Zombie.

816
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,450
Let me out of here!

817
01:13:21,240 --> 01:13:23,320
<i>Copy that.
Tango Three dropping down 1,000.</i>

818
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,281
You clear on your orders?

819
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:36,682
Infiltrate enemy hornet's nest,
verify enemy and terminate.

820
01:13:37,040 --> 01:13:40,601
Remember, the Others light up green
in your visors.

821
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:43,566
At mission complete, signal for extraction.

822
01:13:43,640 --> 01:13:44,926
We'll get ya home.

823
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:58,208
Holy shit, it's working.
You guys, I got two of 'em straight ahead.

824
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:02,160
And I heard it. I was right there.

825
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,322
Got you, you motherf...

826
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:07,609
I peed. I definitely just peed.

827
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:08,727
Get inside!

828
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,886
Return fire!

829
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,291
Coming this way!

830
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:22,762
- They're over here, too!
- Run for the alley!

831
01:15:23,120 --> 01:15:25,168
Go! Go, go, go!

832
01:15:25,240 --> 01:15:27,288
- Teacup, go, go!
- Go! Run!

833
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:29,126
Move!

834
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:32,565
Go! Go!

835
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,931
Contact!

836
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,648
Stay low!

837
01:15:41,520 --> 01:15:42,646
Get to the bus.

838
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,967
Go!

839
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:14,047
Where's Teacup?

840
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,487
- Where's Teacup? We lost Teacup.
- Over here!

841
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:20,328
Don't do that! Don't scare me like that!

842
01:16:21,680 --> 01:16:22,680
Oompa's been shot!

843
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,848
Down, down! Now, now! Down, down, down!

844
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,126
Oompa's been shot!

845
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,565
Down!

846
01:16:27,640 --> 01:16:28,687
He's not breathing!

847
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:34,965
Don't be dead. Come on, man.

848
01:16:35,040 --> 01:16:36,530
Don't be dead! Please don't be dead!

849
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,009
Oompa... Stay alive, Oompa!

850
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,400
We can't stay here. They'll be back.

851
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,601
That alleyway. We'll have cover there.

852
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:48,727
No, it's too far.

853
01:16:48,800 --> 01:16:51,246
If we're out in the open that long
they'll pick us off one by one.

854
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,321
We need a distraction.

855
01:16:54,440 --> 01:16:56,044
- Okay.
- Okay what?

856
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,366
I'll distract them.

857
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:59,647
When I tell you to run,
run as fast as you can.

858
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:01,364
- Now cover me!
- What?

859
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:18,360
Listen up!

860
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:20,562
On my go, haul ass to the alleyway.

861
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:25,400
Back out there? Are you crazy?

862
01:17:27,560 --> 01:17:29,801
Listen, Teacup,
you just gotta trust me, okay?

863
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:31,450
You're gonna run and don't look back.

864
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:35,361
- What about Oompa?
- He's dead, man. We gotta leave him.

865
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:39,283
Sorry, man. I'm sorry.

866
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:41,804
- Zombie, now! Run!
- Haul ass!

867
01:17:41,880 --> 01:17:44,042
- Go, go, go!
- Let's move! Move! Move!

868
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:23,970
- Stairs.
- Got it.

869
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,246
Clear!

870
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:29,406
Clear!

871
01:18:29,800 --> 01:18:30,926
Clear!

872
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:34,644
Are we still alive?

873
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:35,960
I think so.

874
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:39,761
Watch out!

875
01:18:40,440 --> 01:18:42,044
Don't shoot! It's Ringer!

876
01:18:42,120 --> 01:18:43,610
That was badass, Ringer.

877
01:18:43,680 --> 01:18:46,365
I'd hug you if I didn't think
you'd punch me in the nuts for it.

878
01:18:49,160 --> 01:18:50,685
Okay, so what do we do now?

879
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:53,481
None of this makes sense.

880
01:18:55,160 --> 01:18:57,242
They knock planes out of the sky
and cause earthquakes,

881
01:18:57,320 --> 01:18:59,004
but they're afraid of an army of children?

882
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:02,047
There's something Vosch isn't telling us.

883
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:05,321
Okay, I'm not risking my life for this.

884
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,320
Ringer, what are you doing?

885
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:08,771
I'm unenlisting.

886
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,810
I'm better out there on my own.

887
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:13,087
If you know what's best for you,
you'll do the same.

888
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:15,242
- Holy shit! What the hell is this?
- Zombie, you see this?

889
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,920
- She's green!
- What the hell, you guys?

890
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:18,161
Put your guns down.

891
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,403
You're one of them! You're an alien!

892
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,520
What are you talking about?
I just saved your asses!

893
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,289
If she's one of them,
we have to take her out now.

894
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:26,441
Poundcake, just calm down, all right?

895
01:19:26,520 --> 01:19:27,681
- We have to.
- I can see it!

896
01:19:28,240 --> 01:19:29,571
I can see it inside of her!

897
01:19:29,960 --> 01:19:32,122
- There's nothing inside me!
- Shut up!

898
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,840
- Zombie, what do we do? Do we shoot her?
- It's your call, Zombie.

899
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:43,000
Zombie, what are you doing?

900
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:57,041
What's up, man?

901
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,488
- Oh, my God! What's going on, man?
- Come on, man.

902
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:02,085
Hey. Put your guns down.
Put your guns down.

903
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:05,050
Don't shoot. Calm down.
She's not an Other. Neither am I.

904
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:06,804
- I'm glowing green, right?
- Yeah.

905
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,882
Yeah. Yeah, listen.

906
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:11,046
You know me.

907
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:12,811
Come on, Dumbo. You know who I am.

908
01:20:12,880 --> 01:20:14,211
Put the guns down.

909
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:16,688
Just put 'em down! I'm not an Other.

910
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:19,604
I don't even think any of those people
out there shooting at us are Others.

911
01:20:19,720 --> 01:20:21,529
Reznik, Vosch...

912
01:20:22,280 --> 01:20:23,486
They lied to us.

913
01:20:24,200 --> 01:20:25,725
They lied to us, man.

914
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:28,802
Green doesn't mean alien.
Green means human.

915
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:30,925
Just, without one of these.

916
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,971
What are you talking about?

917
01:20:33,080 --> 01:20:34,161
Don't you guys see?

918
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:38,040
Those lenses, these trackers,
it's all fake, man.

919
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,963
It's an illusion. It's a trick.

920
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,320
They weren't testing these.
They were testing us.

921
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:45,409
They were seeing how we would do,
how we would hold up under pressure.

922
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,000
All right? If we would do
what we were trained to do.

923
01:20:48,040 --> 01:20:50,930
- To kill Others!
- No, to kill the survivors, man!

924
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:53,606
To kill survivors.

925
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:57,886
Yeah, well, what about the guys outside,
the ones that were shooting at us?

926
01:20:57,960 --> 01:20:59,041
They're human.

927
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,168
Why would the Army want us
to kill other humans?

928
01:21:02,080 --> 01:21:04,447
Because the Army, Reznik, Vosch,

929
01:21:04,920 --> 01:21:06,410
they're the Others.

930
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:08,201
And because we're kids,

931
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:11,329
they thought they could manipulate us
into doing their dirty work.

932
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:14,049
We're not fighting the 5th Wave.

933
01:21:15,560 --> 01:21:17,130
We are the 5th Wave.

934
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:21,961
Oh, God.

935
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,446
So...

936
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,241
What do we do?

937
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:29,806
Take out your trackers.

938
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,451
We go AWOL.

939
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:35,480
This means we can't go back.
You know that, right?

940
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,801
Nugget

941
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,810
I left him back at the base.

942
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:47,005
- I was trying to protect him.
- Jeez.

943
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:49,128
- I gotta go back.
- That's suicide, dude.

944
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:51,441
- No, man. I gotta go back.
- You can't just wander back in there.

945
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:53,160
- They'll know.
- I can't leave him there!

946
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,089
I'll put the tracker back in.
They'll pick me up.

947
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,128
You guys go ahead.
I will meet up with you later.

948
01:21:57,200 --> 01:22:00,329
Dumbo, where can I take a bullet
in the torso and not die?

949
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:05,169
- Are you serious?
- I'm not kidding, man.

950
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,806
Where can I take a bullet in the torso?
I gotta make it look real.

951
01:22:07,880 --> 01:22:09,245
It's the only way
I'm getting back in alive.

952
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:11,727
It's impossible, man.
There's too many organs.

953
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,961
There's gotta be somewhere, man.

954
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:15,884
Ringer, she can make the shot, all right?
I know she can.

955
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:17,166
You want me to shoot you?

956
01:22:17,240 --> 01:22:19,120
Don't pretend like
you haven't thought about it.

957
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:21,208
- Where do you want me to shoot him?
- Uh...

958
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,362
I mean, the... Oh, shit.

959
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,286
Evan Walker.

960
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:04,563
You're out of your drone sector.

961
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:06,641
Hey.

962
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,722
Put the gun down. Stay away.

963
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:27,811
Cassie, run!

964
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:30,046
Where's my gun?

965
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:44,406
Evan.

966
01:25:05,680 --> 01:25:07,091
Drop the gun.

967
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:09,205
Evan, drop it.

968
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:14,244
If I was gonna kill you, Cassie,
I would've done it a long time ago.

969
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:16,365
What are you?

970
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,928
You're one of them. You're a fucking Other.

971
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:22,047
I'm human.

972
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:26,131
But I'm Other, too.

973
01:25:26,840 --> 01:25:27,841
I'm both.

974
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,566
This isn't the first time
the Others have been here.

975
01:25:33,160 --> 01:25:36,289
They came before
and created sleeper agents, like me.

976
01:25:38,040 --> 01:25:39,883
I always felt different.

977
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:44,084
Growing up, there was
this voice in my head.

978
01:25:44,200 --> 01:25:46,441
It was quiet, but it was there.

979
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:48,610
And when the ship arrived,

980
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:53,203
it was like a switch was flipped inside me,

981
01:25:54,040 --> 01:25:55,644
and the sleeper woke up.

982
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:58,371
How many people have you killed?

983
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:07,370
Did you kill your family?

984
01:26:08,040 --> 01:26:09,201
No.

985
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:10,327
The disease...

986
01:26:10,400 --> 01:26:14,564
The disease that the Others created.
The disease that you created.

987
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,324
Your family loved you.

988
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:20,364
Our kind believe that love is just a trick.

989
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:23,000
An instinct.

990
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,208
A way to protect your genetic future.

991
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:29,286
Do you really believe that?

992
01:26:32,760 --> 01:26:33,921
I did.

993
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,770
But then I saw you.

994
01:27:09,480 --> 01:27:10,606
<i>I don't know how.</i>

995
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:13,207
<i>I don't understand it, but...</i>

996
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:16,322
It was like you flipped the switch back.

997
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:19,608
You made me wanna be human again.

998
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:22,760
Did you shoot me?

999
01:27:23,200 --> 01:27:24,326
No.

1000
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:26,806
I saved you.

1001
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:07,085
<i>I was wrong.</i>

1002
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:09,006
They're wrong.

1003
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:11,162
Love's not a trick. It's real.

1004
01:28:12,360 --> 01:28:15,250
I know now because of you.

1005
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:18,090
Look, stay back!

1006
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:20,887
I don't wanna hear any more.

1007
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,011
Just stay there.

1008
01:28:31,720 --> 01:28:33,848
Cassie, please, just let me help you.

1009
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,367
All I wanna do is help you find Sam.

1010
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,925
All right. Get on your knees, Evan.

1011
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,561
All right. Come on, just get on your knees.

1012
01:28:52,760 --> 01:28:53,886
Listen.

1013
01:28:54,440 --> 01:28:56,727
The Army is controlled by the Others.

1014
01:28:58,240 --> 01:29:00,004
They're preparing the kids.

1015
01:29:01,000 --> 01:29:02,001
For what?

1016
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,004
To kill the last humans.

1017
01:29:16,320 --> 01:29:17,810
They'll search you.

1018
01:29:18,720 --> 01:29:20,290
You can't be armed.

1019
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,084
If you follow me,

1020
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,490
I'll shoot you.

1021
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,882
Soldier, where's your unit?

1022
01:29:48,960 --> 01:29:50,086
All dead!

1023
01:29:50,160 --> 01:29:51,161
What's your number?

1024
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,645
2-9-5!

1025
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,601
2-9-5. He'll live.

1026
01:30:00,040 --> 01:30:01,530
Let's bug out!

1027
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:03,409
<i>All right, copy that, Tango Three.</i>

1028
01:30:03,480 --> 01:30:05,369
Tango Three returning to base!

1029
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:07,524
2-9-5 on deck!

1030
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,126
The rest of the squad are reported KIA.

1031
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:29,371
Ma'am, it's all right. It's all right.
We've got you.

1032
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:33,326
<i>5-4-7!</i>

1033
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,688
<i>547!</i>

1034
01:30:40,960 --> 01:30:43,247
<i>Any family not known to be dead?</i>

1035
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,250
<i>No, just me.</i>

1036
01:30:46,200 --> 01:30:47,361
Stand up.

1037
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:56,369
- You know why you're here, Cassie?
- Uh-uh.

1038
01:31:00,360 --> 01:31:02,010
To get revenge.

1039
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:08,921
He's an Other.

1040
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,206
I know.

1041
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:15,763
It's impossible to tell.

1042
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:21,885
Look through here.

1043
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:26,243
That's its true form.

1044
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:29,011
That's the face it's hiding.

1045
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,050
What happened out there?

1046
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:43,491
It was bad, sir.

1047
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:46,165
We were surrounded.

1048
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:50,004
We tried to move to cover,
but as soon as we did...

1049
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:53,250
They were everywhere, sir.

1050
01:32:54,600 --> 01:32:56,090
- Everyone was hit.
- Except you.

1051
01:33:01,840 --> 01:33:02,887
I took a bullet, sir.

1052
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:04,291
But you survived.

1053
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:07,291
It's a miracle,

1054
01:33:08,080 --> 01:33:11,129
the way that bullet went right through you
and managed to

1055
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:13,125
miss everything important.

1056
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:17,850
Let's make a deal.

1057
01:33:19,080 --> 01:33:21,731
You drop your lie, and I'll drop mine.

1058
01:33:28,880 --> 01:33:30,370
Tell me, Ben.

1059
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,680
What do you know?

1060
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:36,364
I know what you are.

1061
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,291
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?

1062
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,566
Yes.

1063
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:53,521
Why?

1064
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:56,129
What's the point of any of this?

1065
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,881
- What did we do to deserve...
- Nothing.

1066
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,887
Other than occupy a space we need.

1067
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:14,000
We're not that different, Ben.
Your kind would do exactly the same thing.

1068
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:15,081
No.

1069
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:20,401
Our kind wouldn't have
wiped out an entire species.

1070
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:22,324
Of course you would.

1071
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,811
You've been doing it for centuries.

1072
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:30,367
Sir, Sergeant Reznik's dead.

1073
01:34:30,680 --> 01:34:32,011
Security found her body.

1074
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:33,127
- Where?
- In medical.

1075
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:35,840
There's more. Three guards were killed
at the west gate and...

1076
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,161
What the hell was that?

1077
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:41,242
An explosion, sir.
It came from inside the base.

1078
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:43,488
- Get rid of him.
- Damage to Sector Three!

1079
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:44,841
- Captain.
- Let's go.

1080
01:34:44,920 --> 01:34:49,209
We need to move all the recruits off-base.
Get 'em on planes to Wonderland now.

1081
01:34:49,280 --> 01:34:51,282
Deploy units. Find out who's attacking us.

1082
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,408
South corridor! On the double!

1083
01:35:30,120 --> 01:35:32,487
They're taking out our security cameras.

1084
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,771
Bring the drones home
so we can see who's attacking us.

1085
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:39,927
Yeah, these are the changes
from about 60 minutes ago.

1086
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:47,641
Hey!

1087
01:35:48,440 --> 01:35:50,488
- Don't move, all right! Don't move!
- It's okay! Okay, all right!

1088
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:53,689
Cassie? My name's Ben Parish.
We used to go to high school together.

1089
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:55,250
I know who you are.

1090
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,160
What squad are you in?

1091
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:00,807
I'm looking for my brother, Sam.

1092
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:01,881
Sam?

1093
01:36:02,640 --> 01:36:04,404
Sam Sullivan? Sam Sullivan?

1094
01:36:04,480 --> 01:36:06,482
- You know my brother?
- Yes, yes, we're in the same squad.

1095
01:36:06,560 --> 01:36:08,289
- You know where he is?
- I'm trying to get to him right now.

1096
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,840
<i>All recruits
report to the transport area.</i>

1097
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:12,360
They're sending the kids off to war.

1098
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,443
Vosch. The Army. They're Others.

1099
01:36:14,520 --> 01:36:17,126
Look, Sam is about to
get on one of those planes.

1100
01:36:17,200 --> 01:36:19,362
If we don't go now, you're not gonna
see him again. You understand?

1101
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:20,601
We don't have much time.

1102
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:22,762
<i>- All recruits report to the transport area.</i>
- All right.

1103
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,370
- Ready?
- Come on.

1104
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:30,808
Once the recruits reach Wonderland,
get them ready for immediate deployment.

1105
01:36:30,880 --> 01:36:31,961
Yes, sir.

1106
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:38,689
Transfer area's this way.

1107
01:36:45,840 --> 01:36:46,966
Hey!

1108
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:48,371
This is a restricted area.

1109
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,080
- Hey, it's all right.
- On your knees!

1110
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:53,486
Hands behind your head!

1111
01:37:02,160 --> 01:37:04,561
No, it's fine. He's one of us. It's okay.

1112
01:37:05,080 --> 01:37:06,491
Evan, what are you doing here?

1113
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,721
Helping you.

1114
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:11,481
Who's he?

1115
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:14,641
Ben Parish.

1116
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:17,281
Ben Parish?

1117
01:37:18,120 --> 01:37:19,281
Yeah. Uh...

1118
01:37:20,400 --> 01:37:22,562
He was just here.

1119
01:37:27,160 --> 01:37:28,685
I told you not to follow me.

1120
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,922
Well, I decided to ignore you.

1121
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,485
I've been planting bombs.

1122
01:37:33,880 --> 01:37:37,168
In about 10 minutes,
when the last plane full of kids takes off,

1123
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,766
I'm taking this place down, for good.

1124
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:43,967
I'm sorry I lied to you, Cassie.

1125
01:37:45,920 --> 01:37:50,130
I was wrong when I said
I was both one of you and one of them.

1126
01:37:50,480 --> 01:37:53,131
You can't be both. You have to choose.

1127
01:37:54,720 --> 01:37:56,085
I choose you.

1128
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:10,647
Go.

1129
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,091
Get out of here.

1130
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,325
I'll find you.

1131
01:38:19,200 --> 01:38:21,407
- Who was that?
- Evan Walker.

1132
01:38:22,720 --> 01:38:24,484
We gotta go find Sam.

1133
01:38:25,320 --> 01:38:27,561
I think Evan Walker's about to
blow this place up.

1134
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:33,446
Next floor up.

1135
01:38:34,560 --> 01:38:37,086
Head to the northeast corridor,
number 22, now!

1136
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:38,366
Which way?

1137
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,126
This way.

1138
01:38:50,840 --> 01:38:53,411
<i>Stay with your group leader.</i>

1139
01:38:57,080 --> 01:39:02,041
<i>Proceed to the transport vehicles
in a calm and orderly fashion.</i>

1140
01:39:03,360 --> 01:39:05,328
<i>Stay with your group leader.</i>

1141
01:39:07,520 --> 01:39:10,046
<i>Proceed to the transport vehicles.</i>

1142
01:39:10,120 --> 01:39:12,726
Come on. Move along, people.

1143
01:39:12,840 --> 01:39:13,966
Straight ahead.

1144
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:16,611
<i>- Stay with your group leader.</i>
- Keep it moving.

1145
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:19,805
- Don't fall behind, everyone.
- Where do they think they're going?

1146
01:39:19,880 --> 01:39:23,441
<i>Once you are on the plane,
you will receive further instructions.</i>

1147
01:39:23,560 --> 01:39:25,642
Keep moving. Straight ahead.

1148
01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:27,609
<i>Stay with your group leader.</i>

1149
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:35,406
What's her problem?

1150
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,530
Sam! Sam!

1151
01:39:49,000 --> 01:39:50,684
Sam! Sam! Sam.

1152
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,003
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1153
01:39:54,040 --> 01:39:55,201
Hi.

1154
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,691
- Cassie!
- Don't, don't.

1155
01:39:57,720 --> 01:39:59,210
We gotta go, all right?

1156
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:03,921
Let's go.

1157
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:08,002
<i>Once you are on the plane,
you will receive further instructions.</i>

1158
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,206
Come on.

1159
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:14,766
Hi!

1160
01:40:15,440 --> 01:40:17,442
I missed you so much, Sam.

1161
01:40:21,200 --> 01:40:22,929
I missed you, Cassie.

1162
01:40:23,000 --> 01:40:24,764
Look what I brought back for you.

1163
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:27,840
It's Bear.

1164
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:32,291
I love you.

1165
01:40:34,960 --> 01:40:36,610
I love you, too, Sam.

1166
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:38,281
Hey. Um...

1167
01:40:40,440 --> 01:40:41,680
I gotta take his tracker out.

1168
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:44,009
All right? It's not gonna hurt, okay?

1169
01:40:51,640 --> 01:40:52,641
Is it back up?

1170
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:54,131
All the recruits accounted for?

1171
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,725
Yes, sir. Six barracks left.

1172
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:56,881
Good.

1173
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:00,169
Power up my bird.
Last plane's in the air, evacuate the base.

1174
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,446
Come on!

1175
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:18,331
Shit! It's Vosch!

1176
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:38,488
Run! Run! Go for the truck!

1177
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,521
Go!

1178
01:41:52,800 --> 01:41:54,370
Sam, run faster!

1179
01:41:58,880 --> 01:42:00,041
Go! Go!

1180
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:09,720
Come on, Sam!

1181
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:12,725
- Run!
- Cassie!

1182
01:42:13,720 --> 01:42:14,801
Oh, shit!

1183
01:42:15,880 --> 01:42:16,881
Who is that?

1184
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:21,371
- Come on!
- Come on! Get in!

1185
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:24,646
Come on!

1186
01:42:24,720 --> 01:42:27,405
- Quick, Sammy. Get in!
- All right, come on! Get in! Get in!

1187
01:42:28,720 --> 01:42:29,721
Drive!

1188
01:42:35,320 --> 01:42:36,560
Thanks for coming back.

1189
01:43:13,440 --> 01:43:15,408
- Feel better?
- Yeah, thanks, Dumbo.

1190
01:43:16,680 --> 01:43:18,125
Make sure you give her the food first.

1191
01:43:18,200 --> 01:43:19,929
Let me know if it starts
hurting or anything like that.

1192
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:21,685
- Okay.
- All right.

1193
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,489
Teacup, how you feeling?

1194
01:43:23,560 --> 01:43:24,766
Pretty good.

1195
01:43:25,280 --> 01:43:26,281
All right.

1196
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:37,210
How much longer for food?

1197
01:43:37,560 --> 01:43:39,085
I don't know. Not long.

1198
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:41,366
What are you looking at?

1199
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,764
Trying to find the stars.

1200
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:48,569
It's a little early, isn't it?

1201
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,130
You were named after a star, right?

1202
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,084
Cassiopeia.

1203
01:43:57,800 --> 01:43:59,165
Cassiopeia.

1204
01:44:00,360 --> 01:44:03,011
Yeah. A cluster of stars.

1205
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:07,408
I was named after Ben & Jerry's.

1206
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,010
The truth. Yeah.

1207
01:44:11,120 --> 01:44:13,248
Nothing made my dad happier
than ice cream.

1208
01:44:19,080 --> 01:44:21,128
I'm sure you made him happier.

1209
01:44:27,440 --> 01:44:28,441
Yeah.

1210
01:44:32,360 --> 01:44:33,407
So, uh...

1211
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,045
What do we do now?

1212
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:40,962
We have to save those other kids.

1213
01:44:41,360 --> 01:44:42,441
Yeah.

1214
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,646
How are we gonna do that?

1215
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:46,561
Dinner's ready.

1216
01:44:47,440 --> 01:44:48,521
I don't know yet.

1217
01:44:53,520 --> 01:44:54,681
Well...

1218
01:44:56,200 --> 01:44:58,202
Let's worry about that tomorrow

1219
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:01,124
and just go get something to eat.

1220
01:45:02,960 --> 01:45:03,961
All right.

1221
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:05,641
Hey, Sam.

1222
01:45:05,720 --> 01:45:07,210
Here, wake up, buddy.

1223
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,529
Hey, there he is.

1224
01:45:11,360 --> 01:45:12,486
Come on.

1225
01:45:13,760 --> 01:45:16,684
Come on, lazy bones.
Put your bear down, would you?

1226
01:45:25,720 --> 01:45:28,405
<i>The Others see
our hope as a weakness,</i>

1227
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:31,410
<i>as a delusion.</i>

1228
01:45:33,680 --> 01:45:35,011
<i>But they're wrong.</i>

1229
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:40,051
<i>It's our hope that lets us survive.</i>

1230
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:46,164
<i>That lets us bend, but remain unbroken.</i>

1231
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,240
You two knew each other?

1232
01:45:47,280 --> 01:45:49,080
Yeah,
we went to high school together.

1233
01:45:50,360 --> 01:45:52,840
<i>It's our hope that will let us win one day.</i>

1234
01:45:58,640 --> 01:46:01,610
<i>It's our hope that makes us human.</i>

1234
