183
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,285
Naru, we don't need the torches.
They'll scare the cat.

184
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,955
We're in its hunting grounds.

185
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,581
Why'd you come back?

186
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:10,751
I found tracks, and they were huge.

187
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:13,170
[sighs] I'm not frightened by a bear.

188
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,089
I don't think it was a bear.

189
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,509
I don't know what it was.
I've never seen anything like it.

190
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,220
It skinned and gutted a snake.

191
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,598
Well, whatever it was,
we're in the cat's den now.

192
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,600
We have to deal with it first.

193
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:27,810
Come on.

194
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,736
[Naru] The lion won't think
that we're hunting it here.

195
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:41,991
[sighs] It'll think it's hunting us.

196
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:46,370
We get some bait,
then climb up and wait for it.

197
00:20:47,288 --> 00:20:52,168
A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts.
We could be here all night.

198
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,379
We could stalk the forest all night
and not find anything too.

199
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:58,340
If you're too afraid to hunt,
go back to camp where you belong.

200
00:20:58,424 --> 00:20:59,717
We'll try it Naru's way.

201
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,679
We'll bait it,
then I'll lead the cat to you.

202
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:06,098
Wait.

203
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,227
It's time, Naru.

204
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:13,606
Your kühtaamia.

205
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:18,527
When the lion comes, you tell that thing,

206
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,155
"This is as far as you go.

207
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:23,491
No more. This is it."

00:22:08,786 --> 00:22:11,705
It won't matter how sharp it is
if you're too afraid to use it.

211
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,253
You think you're ready?

212
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,631
You've never faced a lion.

213
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,636
Its mouth full of teeth like arrows,

214
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:31,308
ready to tear your flesh
and crush your bones.

215
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,442
When your brother comes back,
he and I will find the lion

216
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,778
-and kill it. [screams]

00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:05,027
-Taabe went after it.
-Okay.

233
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,362
I have to find him.

234
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,822
No, you need to rest.

There's something else out there.
Taabe needs my help.

242
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:42,773
If your brother needed you,
he wouldn't have brought you back here.

243
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:50,781
You think the reason for kühtaamia
is to prove you can hunt,

244
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:53,784
but there's only one reason.

245
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,329

00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,304

-Naru.

00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:22,266
-There's something else out there.
-And if there is, I'll get it.

265
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,559

-No.

267
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:29,106

-You can't.

268
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:34,403
-Do I need your permission, War Chief?
-[sighs] It's not about permission.

269
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,489
You can't. [stammers, sighs]

270
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,784
I had to carry you back.

271
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:46,915
I can hunt.

272
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,584
You're right.

273
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,170
[sighs] We didn't do it.

274
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,131
