Now our enemies know
they can't forge visas.

but they're stretched really thin.

63

homegrown terrorists to worry about.

Dr. Balan, it also says that you consult

A word.

98
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:29,659
You don't think it's strange that a GP,
who also happens to be a researcher,

99
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,428
wants to attend a pediatrics conference?

as a consultant to make a few extra bucks.

Dr. Balan needs his visa today.
I just thought it would be faster.

- Not to go through proper channels?
- What's this about, Paul?

The director, Perry,
contacted me personally

00:18:21,951 --> 00:18:26,356
to complain that Ms. Abbott had been
making unauthorized inquiries.

190
00:18:26,456 --> 00:18:30,660
Then he called his friend,

if you have issued the visa.

She died because some bureaucrat
kept asking for one more piece of paper.

208

Under the circumstances,

What's that?

624
00:56:48,004 --> 00:56:50,671
It's the flash drive I got from Howie.

625
00:56:51,341 --> 00:56:54,345
Last month we processed
over 600 visa applications,

626
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:59,301
and Bill personally intervened in five
of those cases, including Balan's.

627
00:56:59,682 --> 00:57:02,753
Now for each applicant he used
a different member of the visa team,

628
00:57:02,853 --> 00:57:06,890
and when I started asking questions,
he ignored me, slammed them through.

629
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:09,491
So what's the connection
between the applicants?

630
00:57:10,359 --> 00:57:12,196
I don't know yet.

631
00:57:12,296 --> 00:57:15,643
But we do know Balan is an expert
in combustible gases.

632
00:57:18,267 --> 00:57:21,101
Maybe Bill had the answer.

633
00:57:22,638 --> 00:57:26,444
Bill said something strange in the park.
"Now I have no choice."

634
00:57:26,544 --> 00:57:29,179
He must have kept some information
about the people he let in.

635
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:33,527
- A little leverage, in case he needed it.

just doesn't add up.

- Do you think there's a chance?
- I doubt it. Look at his eyes.

653
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,135
He's swimming in dope.

654
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:34,602
Someone kept him alive for as long
as possible to get this footage.

655
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:39,460
But how did they know it was
Bill's son, or who Bill was?

656
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,012
They must have someone
with access to army records.

657
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:45,483
Doesn't have to be a major player.
A guy inputting data could be enough.

658
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,584
Once they knew it was Bill,
they threatened to kill his son

659
00:59:47,684 --> 00:59:51,121
- if he didn't give them what they wanted.
- Which makes Bill's actions understandable.

660
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:52,645
But not excusable,

661
00:59:52,745 --> 00:59:55,300
because once Bill got his people into
the States, it was only a matter of time

662
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,528
before he eliminated everyone
who handled the paperwork.

663

who murdered them to come after me.
