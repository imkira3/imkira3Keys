26
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:42,664
Come on, Alejandro, it is my turn.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,212
Let me see.

29
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,761
Hey! What are you doing cutting holes in my wagon?

30
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:18,779
Sorry, Señor Lopez.

31
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,582
We were just waiting for Zorro.

32
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,877
Go home, muchachos.

33
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:25,086
Do you think he's going to come?

34
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,189
Someone thinks he will.

35
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,404
Joaquin, Alejandro, once I carved coffins for your mother and father.

36
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,008
I would hate to carve ones for you.

37
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:39,892
Now, go!

38
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:54,051
Alejandro, Joaquin, this is no place for you.

39
00:02:54,077 --> 00:02:56,117
Get back to the mission.

40
00:03:49,605 --> 00:03:52,648
Don Montero, for the love of God, why are you still here?

41
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:56,068
Now, now, Don Luiz. Calm, calm.

42
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:59,238
Santa Anna's men are three miles from the town.

43
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:00,514
You have to go now.

44
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:05,161
The government of Spain would like
to thank you for your devoted service.

45
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:16,505
This land is the property of the Spanish government.

46
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:19,884
In two hours it will be the property of the Mexican government...

47
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,928
...unless I hand them over to you.

48
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,858
I am well acquainted with Santa Anna.

49
00:04:23,884 --> 00:04:25,414
He will realize that the dons...

50
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:28,851
...will be dutiful taxpayers and he will respect your claims.

51
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,646
The rest of Alta California I have divided equally...

52
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,362
...among the other dons.

53
00:04:33,388 --> 00:04:36,550
Make sure that all of them receive their grants.

54
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:45,409
Get the children out of the plaza immediately.

55
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,582
The children should never have to see the things we do.

56
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,212
I want to see! Put me down.

57
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,055
Zorro?

58
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:14,199
I saw him.

59
00:05:14,225 --> 00:05:16,632
I saw Zorro.
Come on.

60
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:33,165
Who are these men that you would risk your life to have killed?

61
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,543
Who are they?
No idea.

62
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:38,045
Three peasants pulled at random from the crowd.

63
00:05:53,395 --> 00:05:55,187
Where is he?

64
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:15,332
Go.

65
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,877
Come on.

66
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,546
My thanks to you, gentlemen.

67
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:55,182
Now, if you will excuse me, I'm missing my own party.

68
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:13,617
Kill him!

69
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,766
You would murder three innocent men to capture me?

70
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:41,478
I would murder 100 innocent men if it meant killing you.

71
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,736
Three men, three cuts.

72
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:50,971
A small memento of Mexico, Rafael.

73
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:53,240
To remind you not to return.

74
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:40,556
Tornado, my old friend, you are getting too old for this.

75
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,058
Yes, me too.

76
00:11:09,294 --> 00:11:10,961
Is she warm enough?

77
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:14,548
I always put on an extra blanket for you, Señor.

78
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,755
But the good prince was not afraid of the evil king.

79
00:11:54,923 --> 00:11:57,633
He raced across the drawbridge, fighting off 100 guards.

80
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,678
And then, looking very handsome and
dashing in the late-afternoon sun...

81
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,349
...he leapt onto the balcony and thrust his enchanted sword...

82
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:06,767
...under the king's chin.

83
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:12,231
"You would kill three innocent men just to capture me?"

84
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,108
"Yes."

85
00:12:15,652 --> 00:12:20,322
Then suddenly lightning flashed and
thunder shocked the wasted land.

86
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,327
The evil king glared at the good prince and said....

87
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,082
Something very forgettable.

88
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,751
And the good prince, what did he do?

89
00:12:33,962 --> 00:12:38,966
Well, he leapt from the balcony onto
his faithful old steed, Tornado...

90
00:12:39,134 --> 00:12:42,511
...and raced home to his beautiful wife, Esperanza...

91
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:45,264
...and to his little child, Elena.

92
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,560
Never to do anything so foolish or dangerous again.

93
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,771
She loves to hear your stories.

94
00:12:54,858 --> 00:12:57,025
It's only the sound of my voice.

95
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,611
One day she will have no time for them.

96
00:12:59,779 --> 00:13:03,532
I never tire of them.
Why should she?

97
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:12,875
Esperanza.

98
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:22,050
She already has your strength.

99
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:26,013
Today she broke the little clay horse you made for her.

100
00:13:26,181 --> 00:13:28,098
Diego.

101
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:30,517
It's just a scratch.

102
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,936
Diego, you promised me.

103
00:13:33,104 --> 00:13:36,982
No more nights waiting up praying you come home alive.

104
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,861
The Spaniards are going home.

105
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:42,596
Today is Zorro's last ride.

106
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:47,493
From now on we will grow old together with our five children.

107
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,914
-Five?
-Yeah. Not enough?

108
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,917
I love you.

109
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:10,641
Doña de la Vega, still as beautiful as ever.

110
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:14,333
Don Rafael, what an honor.

111
00:14:14,359 --> 00:14:17,172
The governor in my home.

112
00:14:17,315 --> 00:14:19,918
You'll stay for dinner, of course.

113
00:14:19,944 --> 00:14:22,844
I have come to apologize, Esperanza.

114
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:27,741
I'm sorry that I could not protect this country from the peasants.

115
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,953
I'm sorry that I couldn't make you love me.

116
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,456
And I'm sorry that I have to leave you without a husband.

117
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,625
Arrest him.

118
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:57,938
Blood never lies, Zorro.

119
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:03,290
You are a traitor to your country and your class.

120
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,595
Take him away.

121
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,411
Wait.

122
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:51,700
-No!
-No!

123
00:16:10,845 --> 00:16:14,848
I would never have let any harm come to her.

124
00:16:15,016 --> 00:16:17,142
She was never yours to protect.

125
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,564
Elena.

126
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,744
I want you to live with the knowledge...

127
00:16:35,912 --> 00:16:38,288
...that you have lost everything that you hold dear.

128
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,168
I want you to suffer as I have suffered...

129
00:16:43,336 --> 00:16:45,587
...knowing that your child should have been mine.

130
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,276
Elena! Elena!

131
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,336
Let me hold her.

132
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:29,506
Let me hold her!

133
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:32,759
Rafael!

134
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,887
She has her mother's eyes.

135
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:49,776
Rafael! You'll never be rid of me!

136
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:29,733
Stayed on their track Bringing them back

137
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:35,071
So pay the bounty now to me 'Cause....

138
00:18:41,037 --> 00:18:43,663
'Cause...?

139
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,333
-Nobody's tough as Jack -Nobody's tough as Jack

140
00:18:46,501 --> 00:18:49,085
-Nobody's tough as Jack
-Nobody's tough as Jack

141
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:52,256
Now you're getting there.

142
00:18:52,282 --> 00:18:53,824
Like I done told you...

143
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,968
...singing can lighten your terrible load.

144
00:19:16,531 --> 00:19:19,324
Hey, hey, hey!

145
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:24,704
Come one, come all, for the fright of your life.

146
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,521
See the notorious Murrieta brothers.

147
00:19:28,547 --> 00:19:31,111
Robbers, horse thieves...

148
00:19:31,254 --> 00:19:35,285
...bandits, people of the worst sort.

149
00:19:35,311 --> 00:19:37,325
Hey! Get out here.

150
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:44,599
Garcia. The Murrieta brothers.

151
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,813
Get over here.

152
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,121
These men are now in the custody of Corporal Armando Garcia.

153
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,290
We will take them the rest of the way.

154
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,456
Claim your bounty in Tlaxco.

155
00:20:10,482 --> 00:20:13,194
When bulls start wearing bloomers.

156
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,964
How much are we worth?

157
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:21,386
All figured, about 200 pesos.

158
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:25,017
Two hundred pesos?
That's it?

159
00:20:25,043 --> 00:20:27,334
A lousy 200 pesos apiece?

160
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,992
We are wasting time.

161
00:20:29,018 --> 00:20:31,671
That's 200 for the both of you.

162
00:20:31,814 --> 00:20:33,621
What? Are you crazy?

163
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:35,634
Don't take it, Jack.

164
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:42,032
Touch my brother again, and I'll kill you.

165
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,409
Yes, he will.

166
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:49,080
Hey, I thought you were tied up.

167
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,334
That's because you're stupid.

168
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,008
Drop it. Drop it.

169
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,221
Hey.

170
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,922
They got a strongbox on the wagon.

171
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:12,337
We know. That's why we came.

172
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,446
It is a fact that I, the legendary Three-Fingered Jack...

173
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,125
...ain't even mentioned.

174
00:21:23,151 --> 00:21:24,724
I ain't even mentioned.

175
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:30,038
Ain't I the one that figured to kidnap
the mayor from his own outhouse?

176
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:34,376
I tell you, I am the holy guts of this gang.

177
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,046
Without me, the whole dang opera falls apart.

178
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,514
Go. Go.

179
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:31,725
Come on. Get up, get up.

180
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,689
Go.

181
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,151
Go.

182
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:05,967
I want you to know I consider this an honor.

183
00:23:39,335 --> 00:23:43,713
Bury the body. Bag the head.

184
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,901
Of course I have feelings for you.

185
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,170
Yes, yes, but quick.

186
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:53,141
Hide in the barn.

187
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,076
He's coming.

188
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,371
What do you want?

189
00:25:01,397 --> 00:25:03,276
Please don't touch me.

190
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:06,212
What do you want? Who are you?

191
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,430
Don Rafael!

192
00:26:09,026 --> 00:26:10,985
Listen to me.

193
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:14,822
If any of you is, or ever was...

194
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,993
...that masked man all dressed in black known as Zorro...

195
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,955
...reveal himself now.

196
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,458
I'm Zorro!

197
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:28,560
-They took my mask, my sword--

198
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,030
-Silence, you old fool!

199
00:26:31,173 --> 00:26:34,331
I am Zorro! I am the man you want.

200
00:26:34,357 --> 00:26:36,160
I am the original--

201
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:41,015
Liar! Anyone can see you are too tall.

202
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:30,648
Get him out of here before he starts to stink.

203
00:27:48,584 --> 00:27:50,376
Did you find him?

204
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,715
He's dead.

205
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,094
Back to the boat. I need some sleep before landing tomorrow.

206
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,870
The governor has returned!

207
00:29:58,589 --> 00:29:59,672
Luiz.

208
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,502
Welcome home, Rafael.

209
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:04,118
It has been too long.

210
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,387
Too long, my friend.

211
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,308
You said once you favored me above all.

212
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:14,562
Consider this a fool's apology for ever doubting you.

213
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:25,239
Come. A crowd has gathered to greet you.

214
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,288
-Don Pedro.
-Don Rafael, welcome.

215
00:30:32,456 --> 00:30:34,165
-You're looking well.
-Thank you.

216
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:35,917
-Don Hector.
-Welcome back, sir.

217
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,753
Don Julio.

218
00:30:38,921 --> 00:30:41,380
Gentlemen.

219
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:51,015
Please, please.

220
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:55,061
I know you are not really happy to see me...

221
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:58,606
...so let us all stop pretending, shall we?

222
00:30:58,774 --> 00:31:01,776
You think I don't know that you have been paid...

223
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:05,571
...even threatened, to come out in the hot sun and greet me?

224
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:10,201
I understand exactly how you feel.

225
00:31:10,369 --> 00:31:15,122
Why should you care about any
of your leaders, past or present?

226
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,625
What did they ever do for you?

227
00:31:18,043 --> 00:31:21,796
The Spaniards oppressed you, the Mexicans ignored you.

228
00:31:21,964 --> 00:31:23,224
And the dons?

229
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,866
Well, the dons, the dons.

230
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:31,138
The dons seem merely content to cheat and lie to you.

231
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:38,020
In fact, I put it to you. Who, in your
entire history, has ever helped you?

232
00:31:38,188 --> 00:31:42,650
Zorro! Zorro fought for the people.

233
00:31:46,989 --> 00:31:50,366
Yes, Zorro.

234
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:54,829
Where is he now, Padre, your masked friend?

235
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:58,708
Unless I am mistaken, he hasn't shown himself in 20 years.

236
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,502
Twenty years!

237
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,505
People of California...

238
00:32:04,673 --> 00:32:08,175
...the time has come to take our destiny into our own hands.

239
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:14,015
Not as Spaniards, not as Mexicans, but as Californians.

240
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:25,192
I stand here before you today with no mask.

241
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,324
Only a pledge, a solemn pledge that I will never abandon you.

242
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:35,286
And you have my word, the word of Rafael Montero...

243
00:32:35,454 --> 00:32:38,706
...that I will do everything within my power to help you fight...

244
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:41,751
...for a free and independent California!

245
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,764
Father.

246
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,398
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.

247
00:33:11,448 --> 00:33:13,991
Thank you.

248
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:17,622
Can anyone tell me what this flower is?

249
00:33:17,648 --> 00:33:18,604
I know this scent.

250
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,499
It's called romneya.

251
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:23,417
But it only grows in California...

252
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,420
...and I believe this is your first visit to our shores.

253
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:28,214
Yes.

254
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,912
Hey, hey, hey. More whiskey.

255
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,652
Or whatever you call this.

256
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:05,234
I don't want to see the bottom of this glass.

257
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,711
Money first.

258
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,754
Money first.

259
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,842
Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait!

260
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,514
-What about this?
-Silver!

261
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:22,685
Of course, silver. The finest.

262
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,857
Where did you get that?

263
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:32,845
It's none of your business.

264
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,906
Where did you get it?

265
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,162
It was my brother's.

266
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,123
He is dead.

267
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,087
-I'm sorry.
-You're sorry?

268
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,590
Why should you be sorry?

269
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,261
You should not trade it for a mere glass of whiskey.

270
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:01,390
Why not?
You think I could get two?

271
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:10,232
Who is that?

272
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,262
The man who killed my brother.

273
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:17,640
You're drunk and angry...

274
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,076
...in no condition to fight a professional soldier.

275
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:24,747
Get out of my way, old man.

276
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:56,237
Would you care to try again?

277
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,365
You're welcome.

278
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:04,912
-For what?
-For saving your life.

279
00:36:09,251 --> 00:36:10,945
I would have killed him.

280
00:36:10,971 --> 00:36:12,009
No, not today.

281
00:36:12,035 --> 00:36:13,888
He is trained to kill.

282
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:15,756
You seem trained to drink.

283
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:19,009
You would have fought very bravely and died very quickly.

284
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,637
Who then would avenge your brother?

285
00:36:23,265 --> 00:36:25,307
I would have found a way.

286
00:36:26,059 --> 00:36:27,350
I have never lost a fight.

287
00:36:27,376 --> 00:36:29,461
Except to a crippled old man just now.

288
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:34,650
-What is your name?
-Alejandro.

289
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,610
Alejandro.

290
00:36:38,989 --> 00:36:41,365
You know, there is a very old saying:

291
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,868
"When the pupil is ready, the master will appear."

292
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,787
If you want to kill this man I can teach you how.

293
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:49,874
How to move, how to think,
how to take your revenge with honor.

294
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,744
And live to celebrate it.

295
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:54,153
It will take dedication and time.

296
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,131
Why are you so eager to help me?

297
00:36:57,299 --> 00:37:01,302
Because once, a long time ago...

298
00:37:03,471 --> 00:37:05,306
...you did the same for me.

299
00:37:16,151 --> 00:37:18,402
I can't believe it.

300
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:25,117
I never thought that, one day, I would
be standing in the lair of the fox.

301
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,036
In the lair of Zorro.

302
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:33,208
This place was devoted to the training of Zorro.

303
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:37,070
Where were you all these years?

304
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:39,073
I thought you were dead.

305
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,255
I was dead.

306
00:37:41,281 --> 00:37:44,912
And we will leave it at that.

307
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:54,497
I remember the last time I saw you.

308
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:57,174
You were fighting a hundred men.

309
00:37:57,317 --> 00:37:58,021
A hundred men?

310
00:37:58,047 --> 00:37:59,051
I do not forget.

311
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,238
You were the greatest swordsman who ever lived. Yes.

312
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:07,159
Rafael Montero was the governor of California then.

313
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:09,703
Do you remember him?

314
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,206
What?

315
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,528
Rafael Montero.

316
00:38:14,554 --> 00:38:16,735
Do you remember him?

317
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:20,881
Yes. His soldiers killed many.

318
00:38:21,049 --> 00:38:25,803
And he was the sworn enemy of Zorro.
You.

319
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,525
Montero has come back.

320
00:38:28,551 --> 00:38:30,749
Good.
Then you can kill him.

321
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:35,312
No, there are too many complications for me to ignore.

322
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:39,733
What complications?

323
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,368
I can see we are not gonna spend much time talking.

324
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:53,747
Montero has some design for California...

325
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:57,751
...otherwise he would not have
retained the services of Captain Love.

326
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,655
We must find out what that is.

327
00:39:00,681 --> 00:39:02,322
And then what?

328
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:07,261
If you are ready, we will both tempt our fates.

329
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,304
Let's go, then.

330
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,978
Do you know how to use that thing?

331
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:19,189
Yes. The pointy end goes into the other man.

332
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,113
This is going to take a lot of work.

333
00:39:28,158 --> 00:39:30,520
This is called a training circle.

334
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:31,935
The master's wheel.

335
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:36,206
This circle will be your world, your whole life.

336
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,460
Till I tell you otherwise, there is nothing outside of it.

337
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,964
-Captain Love--
-There is nothing outside of it.

338
00:39:44,132 --> 00:39:48,302
Captain Love does not exist until I say he exists.

339
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:59,271
As your skill improves you will progress to a smaller circle.

340
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:02,983
Each new circle brings you that much closer to your adversary.

341
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:05,069
That much closer to retribution.

342
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:10,991
-I like that part.
-Shall we?

343
00:40:32,097 --> 00:40:36,850
Slow. Attack slow. Attack.

344
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,937
Slow. Again. Slow.

345
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:44,900
First triangle. Slowly. Good.

346
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,403
-Good. That is good.
-Thank you.

347
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,864
Attack.

348
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:56,036
Good.

349
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,873
Time for a drink.

350
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,428
Perfect. Do it again.

351
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,657
One, five, three!

352
00:41:34,409 --> 00:41:36,785
Six, four, two!

353
00:41:36,953 --> 00:41:39,371
And lunge.

354
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,331
Over-lunge!

355
00:41:50,091 --> 00:41:54,887
Lesson number one: Never attack in anger.

356
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:02,311
Lesson number two:

357
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,605
Come with me.

358
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,317
What?

359
00:42:22,165 --> 00:42:25,065
So, what is lesson number three?

360
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:27,903
To get to lesson number four.

361
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,150
Again?

362
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,474
Black Andalusian. Magnificent.

363
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,661
It looks like your
old horse, Tornado.

364
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,719
Quiet, quiet.

365
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:13,564
Damned horse.
What are you doing, huh?

366
00:44:13,590 --> 00:44:15,427
What are you doing?

367
00:44:17,405 --> 00:44:18,864
I'll see you tonight.

368
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:44,556
Zorro, you look better than ever.

369
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:15,796
Be careful, señorita, there are dangerous men about.

370
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:20,842
Well, if you see any, be sure to point them out.

371
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,797
Listen.
I'm going to give you the great honor...

372
00:46:40,965 --> 00:46:43,592
...of being my horse.

373
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:04,237
We are like one spirit.

374
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:12,245
Damn it! Stop!

375
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,304
Go, go, go!

376
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,213
Get him!

377
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:45,750
Kill him.

378
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:26,332
Zorro! The legend has returned!

379
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,081
Don't yell.

380
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,407
I need sanctuary, Father.

381
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:12,403
You don't know me--

382
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:15,006
Zorro! Of course I know you.

383
00:52:15,174 --> 00:52:16,851
Zorro, is it really you?

384
00:52:16,877 --> 00:52:20,161
The years have been kinder to you than to me.

385
00:52:20,304 --> 00:52:23,278
I have no time to talk now.

386
00:52:23,304 --> 00:52:26,167
Father, please, hide me.

387
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,560
Come.

388
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,734
It's just like the old days.

389
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:45,078
Padre, is that you?

390
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:47,149
Is everything all right?

391
00:52:47,175 --> 00:52:49,440
It sounds like there is a battle going on.

392
00:52:50,751 --> 00:52:52,517
Don't worry, my dear.

393
00:52:52,543 --> 00:52:55,905
You are safe in the house of the Lord.

394
00:52:56,048 --> 00:52:57,354
Of course, Padre.

395
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:00,451
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

396
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,679
It has been three days since my last confession.

397
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,765
How many sins could you have committed in three days?

398
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,935
Come back when you have more time, please.

399
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:14,190
-Excuse me?
-Listen, señorita....

400
00:53:16,944 --> 00:53:20,363
Please, go on.

401
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:23,916
I broke the Fourth Commandment.

402
00:53:23,942 --> 00:53:25,852
You killed somebody?

403
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:29,671
That's not the Fourth Commandment.

404
00:53:29,697 --> 00:53:31,482
Of course not.

405
00:53:32,585 --> 00:53:38,214
In what way did you break the most sacred of Commandments?

406
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:41,301
I dishonored my father.

407
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,133
That is not so bad.

408
00:53:43,159 --> 00:53:45,330
Maybe your father deserved it.

409
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:47,572
What did you say?

410
00:53:47,598 --> 00:53:51,920
I said, tell me more, my child.

411
00:53:52,646 --> 00:53:57,275
Well, I try to behave properly,
the way my father would like me to.

412
00:53:57,443 --> 00:54:01,529
-But I'm afraid my heart is too wild.
-Too wild?

413
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:06,492
-Yes.
-Could you be more specific?

414
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,203
I had impure thoughts about a man.

415
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,368
I did. I think he was a bandit or something.

416
00:54:12,394 --> 00:54:13,858
He wore a black mask.

417
00:54:16,462 --> 00:54:21,799
-He had a deep voice?
-Yes.

418
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,975
Ruggedly handsome?

419
00:54:25,001 --> 00:54:28,831
His face was half-covered.

420
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:32,060
But something in his eyes captured me.

421
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,686
Captured you.

422
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:38,858
I felt warm and feverish.

423
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,735
Lustful?

424
00:54:43,656 --> 00:54:46,240
Yes, lustful.

425
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:50,495
Forgive me.

426
00:54:55,376 --> 00:54:57,210
I forgive you.

427
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,967
Look over there, by the altar.

428
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:07,869
Search everything.

429
00:55:07,895 --> 00:55:11,874
The chapel, the loft, the rectory, all of it.

430
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,560
This is a house of God.

431
00:55:14,937 --> 00:55:18,356
Don't worry, Padre, we'll be gone by the time he gets back.

432
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:24,654
Señorita, you have done nothing wrong.

433
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:29,450
The only sin would be to deny what your heart truly feels.

434
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:32,370
Now, go.

435
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,333
Elena.

436
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:43,962
What are you doing here?

437
00:55:43,988 --> 00:55:45,408
I was confessing.

438
00:55:45,551 --> 00:55:47,760
-Confessing?
-Yes.

439
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:51,097
To whom?
The priest is here.

440
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:58,271
Stand back, Elena.
Please.

441
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:22,128
Out of respect for Miss Montero, I'll deal with you later.

442
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:32,805
Horse! Come here.

443
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:42,940
Blackie! Thunder! Storm!

444
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:46,694
Stupido! Get over here now!

445
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:53,534
I warn you. I'll get another horse.

446
00:58:01,228 --> 00:58:03,521
So?

447
00:58:03,689 --> 00:58:05,565
What do you think?

448
00:58:09,570 --> 00:58:16,033
Sir, I got the black stallion, I carved a "Z" in the--

449
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,621
The people will be speaking the name of Zorro again.

450
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:27,295
You think stealing a horse makes you
worthy enough to wear that mask?

451
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,257
Be careful.

452
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:39,015
You're a thief, Alejandro.
A pitiful clown.

453
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:42,935
Zorro was a servant of the people, not a seeker of fame like you.

454
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,771
A buffoon.

455
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,327
Zorro did what was needed.

456
00:58:50,353 --> 00:58:52,094
Now he is needed again.

457
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:57,116
I didn't ask for your help in the cantina...

458
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:01,662
...but I came here to learn how to fight like you.

459
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:05,333
To have your strength, your courage.

460
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,629
Now when I try to use them, you slap me down?

461
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,708
Let me tell you something.

462
00:59:11,734 --> 00:59:15,409
I am tired of all your training, your lecturing.

463
00:59:15,552 --> 00:59:20,264
I am tired of waiting for you to tell me I am ready.

464
00:59:20,432 --> 00:59:25,978
I have my own scores to settle, a new life to find.

465
00:59:27,231 --> 00:59:31,984
I thought I could do it here, but I was wrong.

466
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:35,488
Alejandro!

467
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:37,657
En garde!

468
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:43,829
Choose your weapon.

469

489
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:08,187
Montero has invited every don in California to a banquet.

490
01:00:08,355 --> 01:00:13,025
If you want to be of service, you can join them as a spy.

491
01:00:14,069 --> 01:00:17,571
I think I do not understand, sir.

492
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:21,325
You have passion, Alejandro, and your skill is growing.

493
01:00:21,493 --> 01:00:25,746
But I must give you something which is beyond your reach.

494
01:00:25,914 --> 01:00:31,168
-Yes? What is that?
-Charm.

495
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,879
And what is that?

496
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:41,220
Convince Montero that you are a gentleman of stature...

497
01:00:41,388 --> 01:00:44,140
...and he will let you into his circle.

498
01:00:47,561 --> 01:00:49,312
Me?

499
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:52,481
A gentleman?

500
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,694
This is gonna take a lot of work.

501
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,531
Yes.

502
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,927
Look at me. I look like a butterfly.

503
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:24,305
This is the most stupid thing I've ever done.

504
01:01:24,473 --> 01:01:25,184
I doubt that.

505
01:01:25,210 --> 01:01:27,124
We'll never get away with this.

506
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,060
Yes, we will.

507
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:34,440
A nobleman is a man who says one thing and thinks another.

508
01:01:34,608 --> 01:01:36,609
What if Montero realizes who you are?

509
01:01:36,777 --> 01:01:39,779
Montero thinks of himself as a true nobleman.

510
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:44,450
He will never look a servant in the eye. Listen to me.

511
01:01:44,618 --> 01:01:46,786
Listen to me!

512
01:01:49,206 --> 01:01:51,290
Most important thing of all...

513
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:54,293
...do not let the dons leave the table without you.

514
01:01:54,461 --> 01:01:56,128
Yes, sir.

515
01:01:57,464 --> 01:01:59,810
Good luck tonight.

516
01:01:59,836 --> 01:02:01,659
Thank you.

517
01:02:01,802 --> 01:02:06,263
Stand up straight. Charm.

518
01:02:06,431 --> 01:02:08,140
Charm.

519
01:02:25,951 --> 01:02:27,955
Don Rafael Montero?

520
01:02:27,981 --> 01:02:29,562
Good evening.

521
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:32,623
I am Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

522
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,490
The formal Spanish greeting.

523
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:37,695
I have not seen that in years.

524
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:40,394
My father was very strict.

525
01:02:40,420 --> 01:02:42,533
Who is your father?

526
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,552
Don Bartolo del Castillo.

527
01:02:45,804 --> 01:02:48,848
I have heard of him, but never had the pleasure of meeting him.

528
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:55,020
I arrived last week from Spain by way
of Paris, Lisbon and San Francisco.

529
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,274
I am inspecting my family's holdings.

530
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:08,200
Queen Isabella of Spain has been very generous to us.

531
01:03:09,244 --> 01:03:12,705
Very impressive. What brings you here?

532
01:03:13,415 --> 01:03:17,418
I heard you were back in California
and knew I must introduce myself.

533
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:20,045
Her Royal Highness speaks very highly of you.

534
01:03:22,549 --> 01:03:24,550
Really?

535
01:03:24,718 --> 01:03:29,847
I thought I fell out of favor with the court when California was lost.

536
01:03:36,396 --> 01:03:38,981
Only in certain circles.

537
01:03:39,149 --> 01:03:43,694
Her Majesty knows those unfortunate
events were clearly no fault of yours.

538
01:03:44,821 --> 01:03:49,909
She told me this is still a land of opportunity for a man of vision.

539
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,753
And you are a man of vision?

540
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:56,315
I am a man in search of a vision.

541
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,191
But my timing is unfortunate.

542
01:04:01,217 --> 01:04:03,322
I have interrupted a party.

543
01:04:03,465 --> 01:04:05,424
Perhaps I could call again?

544
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,845
No, it would honor me for you to join us.

545
01:04:10,013 --> 01:04:13,849
No, it would honor me to do so, sir.

546
01:04:14,017 --> 01:04:17,728
Please allow me to introduce my daughter, Elena.

547
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:23,776
Charmed.

548
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:30,783
I'm afraid I have brought no gift for the hostess...

549
01:04:30,951 --> 01:04:34,245
...but wait a moment.

550
01:04:45,966 --> 01:04:49,134
-Thank you.
-A pleasure.

551
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:56,182
Bernardo, pick up your feet.

552
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:58,794
Señorita. Caballero.

553
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:26,589
Don Alejandro.

554
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:29,633
My father and I would like you to join us at our table.

555
01:05:30,635 --> 01:05:33,679
I would be delighted, señorita.

556
01:05:46,276 --> 01:05:49,194
Don Alejandro, I'm so pleased you could join us.

557
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,990
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garcia.

558
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:55,659
Recently returned from Spain.

559
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:58,879
This is Captain Harrison Love.

560
01:05:58,905 --> 01:06:02,316
Not a don, but a kindred spirit.

561
01:06:03,835 --> 01:06:08,589
Are you not the man who was
chasing a legendary bandit recently?

562
01:06:08,757 --> 01:06:10,584
He was hardly legendary.

563
01:06:10,610 --> 01:06:12,284
So you caught him?

564
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:14,992
It's only a matter of time.

565
01:06:15,018 --> 01:06:18,248
The bandit may have escaped...

566
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:23,562
...but the rest of us will think
twice before going to confession.

567
01:06:47,379 --> 01:06:48,921
Thank you.

568
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,760
With all due respect, Don Hector, I disagree.

569
01:06:55,470 --> 01:06:57,930
Until these people are free to govern themselves...

570
01:06:58,098 --> 01:07:01,684
... I think we will see many more Z's carved into walls.

571
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:07,398
Don Alejandro, what do you think?

572
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:12,361
I think sheep will always need a shepherd.

573
01:07:12,612 --> 01:07:17,783
But certainly not this Zorro creature.

574
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:23,747
He probably wears the mask to hide
his bald head and unsightly features.

575
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:28,871
Some would call him heroic.

576
01:07:28,897 --> 01:07:31,488
Heroism, a romantic illusion.

577
01:07:31,631 --> 01:07:33,040
Much like nobility.

578
01:07:33,066 --> 01:07:34,992
Elena, that is enough.

579
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:38,887
I would think heroism is something to aspire to, not sneer at.

580
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:43,809
All that playing swords, shooting guns, racing around on horses...

581
01:07:43,977 --> 01:07:45,644
...gives me a frightful headache.

582
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:49,732
Such sweaty pursuits are hardly the work of a gentleman.

583
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:50,665
And what is?

584
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:52,926
Climbing in and out of carriages?

585
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,862
No, my dear.

586
01:07:55,029 --> 01:08:00,659
But increasing one's holdings so as
to provide lavish comfort for ladies.

587
01:08:00,827 --> 01:08:03,162
Such as yourself.

588
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:11,199
A woman's grasp of politics.

589
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:12,279
What can I say?

590
01:08:16,050 --> 01:08:18,565
We're at a party, aren't we?

591
01:08:18,591 --> 01:08:21,914
May I have the honor of this dance?

592
01:08:25,018 --> 01:08:26,602
I would be glad to.

593
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,653
Yes? Were you looking for something?

594
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:21,365
A sense of the miraculous in everyday life.

595
01:09:22,575 --> 01:09:24,958
Oh, really? Look someplace else.

596
01:09:24,984 --> 01:09:27,813
The lady and I were trying to dance.

597
01:09:27,956 --> 01:09:30,210
You were trying.

598
01:09:30,236 --> 01:09:33,193
She was succeeding.

599
01:09:33,336 --> 01:09:34,959
Forgive me, captain.

600
01:09:34,985 --> 01:09:37,823
A shameless joke at your expense.

601
01:09:37,966 --> 01:09:40,854
I hope it will not be the last.

602
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:43,954
Don Rafael wants you back. Now.

603
01:10:29,893 --> 01:10:34,980
Should we try something more robust,
or do you feel unequal to the task?

604
01:10:35,148 --> 01:10:37,649
No, on the contrary.

605
01:10:37,817 --> 01:10:42,487
I think only of your distaste for perspiration.

606
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:44,114
Maestro.

607
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:14,329
Well, that is the way they are dancing in Madrid these days.

608
01:12:14,497 --> 01:12:17,499
Excuse me, Don Rafael, I need to catch my breath.

609
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:20,752
Your daughter is a very spirited dancer.

610
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:25,757
"Spirited." Thank you for putting it so delicately.

611
01:12:30,138 --> 01:12:32,139
I apologize if you're offended.

612
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:35,851
No, no, no.
Completely unnecessary, I assure you.

613
01:12:36,019 --> 01:12:40,313
She is young and impulsive, but her beauty is beyond compare.

614
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:43,942
And she has her father's commanding presence.

615
01:12:46,070 --> 01:12:47,946
Don Rafael.

616
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:55,996
As an advisor to Her Royal Highness in matters of finance...

617
01:12:56,164 --> 01:13:00,417
...it would be my pleasure to introduce you both at court.

618
01:13:10,386 --> 01:13:11,766
Join us in the courtyard.

619
01:13:11,792 --> 01:13:14,331
There is something I want to share with you.

620
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:16,099
What is that?

621
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:18,643
A vision.

622
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:30,822
Fellow dons of California...

623
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:35,827
...all of us can recall the golden
years when we ruled this country.

624
01:13:35,995 --> 01:13:40,749
We commanded respect and amassed a great deal of wealth.

625
01:13:40,917 --> 01:13:43,168
But there was something that we never achieved.

626
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:46,838
We never determined our own destiny.

627
01:13:48,216 --> 01:13:54,513
Well, the time has come to claim
what always should have been ours.

628
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:57,557
My friends...

629
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:04,064
... I give you the independent Republic of California.

630
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:22,415
Don Rafael, every man here owes you something.

631
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,377
The land you gave us made us all wealthy men.

632
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:30,132
However, we must question your motives.

633
01:14:30,299 --> 01:14:33,468
The day you arrived, you made us look like fools.

634
01:14:33,886 --> 01:14:35,197
That is absurd, Don Pedro.

635
01:14:35,223 --> 01:14:37,038
I was merely playing to the crowd.

636
01:14:37,181 --> 01:14:40,642
And what are you doing now if not playing to the crowd?

637
01:14:40,810 --> 01:14:44,938
You're inciting us to raise arms against Santa Anna.

638
01:14:45,106 --> 01:14:48,191
You know perfectly well we could never defeat his army.

639
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:52,028
I was not suggesting that we fight him for California.

640
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:55,073
I was suggesting that we buy it from him.

641
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,785
Santa Anna is waging an expensive war with the United States...

642
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:00,787
...and is increasingly short of money.

643
01:15:01,414 --> 01:15:03,999
Even if we all combined our fortunes...

644
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:07,669
...we could not come up with enough
to buy this country from Santa Anna.

645
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:10,672
I have already brokered a deal with him.

646
01:15:12,258 --> 01:15:14,259
You are living in a dream.

647
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:20,307
And why don't we all live in the same dream together?

648
01:15:35,114 --> 01:15:37,782
Meet me here tomorrow morning for a journey...

649
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:41,620
...that will open your eyes and lay all your doubts to rest.

650
01:16:34,966 --> 01:16:39,761
My friends, I give you El Dorado!

651
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:53,525
Technically, of course, all this gold belongs to Santa Anna...

652
01:16:53,693 --> 01:16:57,821
...but, fortunately for us, he's completely unaware of its existence.

653
01:16:57,989 --> 01:17:00,824
For the deception to work, these bars have been marked...

654
01:17:00,992 --> 01:17:03,952
...with the Spanish seal so he'll think they're from Spain.

655
01:17:05,454 --> 01:17:06,745
You see now, gentlemen?

656
01:17:06,771 --> 01:17:08,565
Is it becoming clearer to you?

657
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:13,461
Two days from now we will buy this country from Santa Anna.

658
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,673
We will buy it with gold dug from his own land.

659
01:17:27,435 --> 01:17:30,913
Where did you find all these people?

660
01:17:30,939 --> 01:17:33,006
Anywhere we wanted.

661
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:35,567
Brilliant.

662
01:17:36,944 --> 01:17:38,403
Brilliant.

663
01:17:41,782 --> 01:17:44,242
It's only part of the mining process.

664
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:47,746
First we picked it up off the ground, now we're down to blasting.

665
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:07,098
So this is the future of California?

666
01:18:07,933 --> 01:18:11,770
This is my vision, yes.

667
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:19,694
Up here. Well, now, ain't you a sight for sore eyes!

668
01:18:19,862 --> 01:18:25,116
Full-grown vultures walking around like real folk.

669
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:29,037
Welcome.
Welcome to hell's outhouse.

670
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:35,710
They call us the disappeared ones,
but we ain't exactly disappeared.

671
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:38,480
We're just hard to find.

672
01:18:38,506 --> 01:18:41,324
Wait! You. I know you.

673
01:18:41,467 --> 01:18:43,218
You bet you do, peckerwood.

674
01:18:43,386 --> 01:18:46,012
I'm the legendary Three-Fingered Jack.

675
01:18:46,180 --> 01:18:49,682
And you are a bunch of murdering trash...

676
01:18:49,850 --> 01:18:54,229
...dressed up in fancy, sweet-smelling doodads.

677
01:18:54,397 --> 01:18:55,877
Ignore him, gentlemen.

678
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:57,382
He's a common thief.

679
01:18:58,150 --> 01:18:59,984
As common as they come.

680
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:04,155
But I ain't nothing compared to you gentlemen.

681
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:07,158
I steal gold, I steal money.

682
01:19:07,326 --> 01:19:10,995
But you steal people's lives.

683
01:19:11,914 --> 01:19:12,748
So damn you!

684
01:19:12,774 --> 01:19:15,275
And damn the horse
that brung you.

685
01:19:35,354 --> 01:19:37,355
Peckerwood?

686
01:20:19,565 --> 01:20:23,359
Is there something amusing, captain?

687
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:26,070
Strange, I'd say.

688
01:20:26,572 --> 01:20:30,575
It's the second time I've shot this man
while he was flying through the air.

689
01:20:38,709 --> 01:20:39,831
Don Alejandro!

690
01:20:39,857 --> 01:20:43,863
I need to speak with you at the hacienda, alone.

691
01:20:44,840 --> 01:20:50,345
-Some other time, perhaps.
-Today. Alone.

692
01:21:13,285 --> 01:21:15,995
Good afternoon, Bernardo.

693
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:19,541
Good afternoon, señorita.

694
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:22,252
Your voice is so calming.

695
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:23,267
He's high-spirited.

696
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:24,988
He needs to hear something soothing.

697
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:27,507
Yes, I understand.

698
01:21:29,593 --> 01:21:32,762
How long have you served Don Alejandro?

699
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,974
Sometimes it seems interminable.

700
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:36,916
Sorry, I speak out of place.

701
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:38,832
Do not worry, Bernardo.

702
01:21:38,858 --> 01:21:41,170
He will not hear it from me.

703
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:46,192
Don Alejandro confuses me.

704
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:52,073
Sometimes he seems so arrogant, so superior.

705
01:21:52,241 --> 01:21:57,787
And yet the way he looks at me
and the way he dances with me....

706
01:21:57,955 --> 01:22:00,665
As if he were two completely different men.

707
01:22:00,833 --> 01:22:02,250
Yeah.

708
01:22:10,676 --> 01:22:13,469
You look so much like your mother.

709
01:22:15,472 --> 01:22:17,348
How would you know that?

710
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:22,895
Well, I don't see much of Don Rafael in you.

711
01:22:25,566 --> 01:22:28,860
I know my father wishes I acted more like her.

712
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:31,284
She was very proper, my mother.

713
01:22:31,310 --> 01:22:32,764
Always appropriate

714
01:22:32,906 --> 01:22:34,532
Is that how he describes her?

715
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:37,403
Yes. But I do not believe him.

716
01:22:37,429 --> 01:22:39,771
She was more like you.

717
01:22:41,999 --> 01:22:43,175
Perhaps.

718
01:22:43,201 --> 01:22:47,904
It would be a way of knowing her.

719
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:55,845
My niñera told me that the departed
can see you in the moonlight.

720
01:22:56,013 --> 01:23:02,060
When I was young I sneaked out
at night and rode across Andalusia.

721
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:05,855
I would wave at the skies so she would know it was me.

722
01:23:11,654 --> 01:23:13,245
How did she die?

723
01:23:13,271 --> 01:23:15,556
Giving birth to me.

724
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:19,563
My father rarely speaks of her.

725
01:23:19,589 --> 01:23:21,813
I think he finds it too painful.

726
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,749
Yes.

727
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:34,092
I know what it is like to lose a loved one.

728
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:36,511
You?

729
01:23:37,554 --> 01:23:41,349
Yeah. A daughter. Long ago.

730
01:23:43,769 --> 01:23:48,815
When I see you, I remember what it felt like to be a father.

731
01:23:52,444 --> 01:23:58,282
-Your mother would be proud of you.
-Thank you.

732
01:24:00,994 --> 01:24:04,914
Bernardo, I have to ask you, have we ever met before?

733
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:08,584
No, why would you think that?

734
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:11,411
I do not know.

735
01:24:11,437 --> 01:24:15,074
It's strange, your voice seems so familiar.

736
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:20,596
I haven't been to Spain since before you were born.

737
01:24:20,764 --> 01:24:22,724
Of course.

738
01:24:24,309 --> 01:24:27,353
Well, it's a very pleasant voice.

739
01:24:28,856 --> 01:24:31,357
Thank you.

740
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:34,694
-Good day, Bernardo.
-Good day...

741
01:24:40,325 --> 01:24:42,118
...Elena.

742
01:24:57,384 --> 01:25:00,845
Did you know that the Compa Indians of central Peru...

743
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:05,725
...used to cannibalize their enemies
in order to absorb their power?

744
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:09,687
The eyes in particular were most sought after.

745
01:25:12,316 --> 01:25:18,488
To be able to see through the eyes of an enemy is a valuable thing.

746
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:24,579
Where are my manners?

747
01:25:24,605 --> 01:25:27,396
Would you care for something to drink?

748
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:35,671
No?

749
01:25:36,256 --> 01:25:39,884
A different vintage perhaps?

750
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:51,479
You're a very sick person, Captain Love.

751
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:56,150
Heads in water jars, hands in wine pitchers...

752
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:59,320
...must strike you as odd, I suppose.

753
01:26:00,322 --> 01:26:04,283
Well, for one thing, I think you ought to fire your housekeeper.

754
01:26:10,749 --> 01:26:14,627
-Who is he?
-An enemy.

755
01:26:16,380 --> 01:26:19,257
He has a brother out there who will share the same fate.

756
01:26:22,803 --> 01:26:24,887
I wish you luck.

757
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:30,785
To your health.

758
01:26:30,811 --> 01:26:33,337
Murrieta's brother or not...

759
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:36,774
...you are more than you pretend to be.

760
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:41,571
Maybe someday I will see
what I look like through your eyes...

761
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:43,614
...Captain Love.

762
01:27:29,995 --> 01:27:32,663
Oh, it is beautiful.

763
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:51,515
Excuse me. How much does it cost?

764
01:27:57,230 --> 01:28:00,691
It is a gift, she says, in honor of your mother.

765
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,195
My mother?

766
01:28:05,322 --> 01:28:07,352
She loved your mother.

767
01:28:07,378 --> 01:28:09,684
She must be mistaken.

768
01:28:09,826 --> 01:28:13,204
My mother died long ago in Spain.

769
01:28:24,383 --> 01:28:26,050
She says there is no mistaking...

770
01:28:26,218 --> 01:28:29,512
...the daughter of Esperanza and Diego de la Vega.

771
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,677
She says she was your nanny.

772
01:28:32,703 --> 01:28:36,127
She hung flowers on your crib.

773
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:41,065
I'm sorry, I cannot accept it.

774
01:29:00,335 --> 01:29:03,254
Alejandro.

775
01:29:03,547 --> 01:29:04,822
Listen to me.

776
01:29:04,848 --> 01:29:08,868
Can you find your way back to the mine?

777
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,096
No.

778
01:29:13,265 --> 01:29:17,351
The carriage windows were all covered.

779
01:29:17,519 --> 01:29:21,439
-He didn't even trust his own dons.
-Nor would I.

780
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:23,733
You must go to Montero's house tonight.

781
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:26,027
Break into the chest in his study.

782
01:29:26,194 --> 01:29:28,242
Find out what his plans are.

783
01:29:28,268 --> 01:29:30,681
People in the mine are dying.

784
01:29:31,241 --> 01:29:36,620
And all I can think of is Captain Love.

785
01:29:36,788 --> 01:29:39,457
He will come into your circle soon enough.

786
01:29:43,462 --> 01:29:44,960
I miss my brother, sir.

787
01:29:44,986 --> 01:29:46,614
Your brother is dead.

788
01:29:46,757 --> 01:29:48,398
We lose the ones we love.

789
01:29:48,424 --> 01:29:49,408
Put it aside.

790
01:29:50,594 --> 01:29:52,803
How?

791
01:29:54,181 --> 01:29:56,640
How can I do what is needed...

792
01:29:56,808 --> 01:30:01,437
...when all I feel is hate?

793
01:30:02,981 --> 01:30:04,648
You hide it.

794
01:30:06,651 --> 01:30:08,652
With this.

795
01:30:19,664 --> 01:30:22,958
Santa Anna has agreed to the transfer
at noon the day after tomorrow.

796
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:26,420
He insists we deliver the gold five miles north of town.

797
01:30:26,588 --> 01:30:28,380
Captain Love?

798
01:30:31,843 --> 01:30:33,498
It's a safe distance from the mine.

799
01:30:33,524 --> 01:30:34,995
The bars are stamped and ready.

800
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:37,014
I don't foresee a problem.

801
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:38,911
Tell him we agree.

802
01:30:38,937 --> 01:30:42,586
You have done well, Luiz.
Very well.

803
01:30:46,066 --> 01:30:49,527
To the independent Republic of California.

804
01:30:53,115 --> 01:30:55,825
Don Rafael!

805
01:31:20,183 --> 01:31:21,361
You sent men to the hills?

806
01:31:21,387 --> 01:31:22,835
Doubled the guard at the wall?

807
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:24,854
Yes, yes, of course.

808
01:31:31,361 --> 01:31:33,509
After all, it's only one man.

809
01:31:33,535 --> 01:31:36,348
It isn't just one man.
It's Zorro.

810
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:39,526
And he knows about the mine.

811
01:31:39,552 --> 01:31:42,396
Otherwise he wouldn't be here tonight.

812
01:31:42,539 --> 01:31:44,100
How could he possibly--?

813
01:31:44,126 --> 01:31:45,816
It doesn't matter how.

814
01:31:45,959 --> 01:31:48,085
You don't seem to grasp the situation.

815
01:31:48,253 --> 01:31:52,840
If Santa Anna finds out about
this he will have us butchered.

816
01:31:53,758 --> 01:31:55,885
Do you understand?

817
01:31:58,263 --> 01:32:00,764
Then we should destroy the evidence.

818
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,808
Set explosives. Bury the mine.

819
01:32:05,061 --> 01:32:06,298
And the workers?

820
01:32:06,324 --> 01:32:08,797
We destroy all the evidence.

821
01:32:08,940 --> 01:32:10,900
No witnesses.

822
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,534
Make sure those papers are locked up.

823
01:32:37,969 --> 01:32:39,887
Guards!

824
01:32:48,647 --> 01:32:51,205
The much-debated Zorro.

825
01:32:51,231 --> 01:32:54,343
No. The legendary Zorro.

826
01:32:57,155 --> 01:33:01,075
Put down your weapons!
Tell them.

827
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:03,535
Do as he says.

828
01:33:09,501 --> 01:33:11,085
Allow me.

829
01:33:17,676 --> 01:33:20,261
Come. Stop.

830
01:33:21,930 --> 01:33:23,847
Face the window.

831
01:33:25,016 --> 01:33:29,144
Now, bend down and touch your toes.

832
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:33,232
Bend over!

833
01:33:34,985 --> 01:33:38,376
Excuse me, Captain Love.

834
01:33:38,402 --> 01:33:40,097
Thank you.

835
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:05,175
Kill him!

836
01:36:33,538 --> 01:36:35,539
Good morning, señor.

837
01:36:40,086 --> 01:36:41,404
Good morning, señorita.

838
01:36:41,430 --> 01:36:42,404
Give it back.

839
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:45,507
-What?
-Whatever it is you have stolen...

840
01:36:45,675 --> 01:36:48,477
...from my father, I want it back.

841
01:36:48,503 --> 01:36:49,703
Give it to me.

842
01:36:49,846 --> 01:36:52,097
No.

843
01:36:58,521 --> 01:37:00,397
Come on, now.

844
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:17,331
I don't have the time to give you the proper instruction.

845
01:37:19,709 --> 01:37:23,754
I have had the proper instruction since I was 4.

846
01:38:16,975 --> 01:38:19,268
Not bad.

847
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:23,146
Not bad at all.

848
01:38:45,753 --> 01:38:50,173
This will make it more difficult.
Señorita....

849
01:39:15,450 --> 01:39:16,867
Don't move.

850
01:39:38,222 --> 01:39:41,850
-Do you surrender?
-Never.

851
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:45,020
But I may scream.

852
01:39:45,897 --> 01:39:48,065
I understand.

853
01:39:48,232 --> 01:39:50,901
Sometimes I have that effect.

854
01:40:19,597 --> 01:40:22,516
Excuse me.

855
01:40:24,519 --> 01:40:27,104
Goodbye, señorita.

856
01:40:38,533 --> 01:40:39,370
What are you doing?

857
01:40:39,396 --> 01:40:40,100
What happened?

858
01:40:40,410 --> 01:40:42,450
Zorro. Zorro was here.

859
01:40:42,476 --> 01:40:45,814
I fought him and he left.
He left.

860
01:40:45,957 --> 01:40:48,312
Did you recognize him?

861
01:40:48,338 --> 01:40:52,404
No, but he was young and vigorous.

862
01:40:52,714 --> 01:40:56,675
-He was very vigorous, Father.
-Vigorous?

863
01:40:57,301 --> 01:40:59,302
Yes.

864
01:41:38,468 --> 01:41:39,968
Let's go!

865
01:42:56,671 --> 01:42:58,421
Go!

866
01:43:36,210 --> 01:43:37,878
Come on!

867
01:44:12,330 --> 01:44:14,710
Here. This is the canyon.

868
01:44:14,736 --> 01:44:17,400
That is where the mine is.

869
01:44:18,085 --> 01:44:22,797
They have 25, 30 guards at most.

870
01:44:22,965 --> 01:44:24,807
Nothing that Zorro
can't overcome.

871
01:44:24,833 --> 01:44:26,201
I'm not going with you.

872
01:44:26,344 --> 01:44:28,178
What?

873
01:44:28,721 --> 01:44:31,598
I'm not going with you.

874
01:44:32,516 --> 01:44:34,807
There's something I must do.

875
01:44:34,833 --> 01:44:36,878
It's a personal matter.

876
01:44:37,730 --> 01:44:39,479
What about the prisoners?

877
01:44:39,505 --> 01:44:41,883
There's nothing more I can do.

878
01:44:42,860 --> 01:44:44,945
You mean, nothing you will do.

879
01:44:44,971 --> 01:44:46,846
I gave my life to them.

880
01:44:47,615 --> 01:44:49,087
In return, I lose everything.

881
01:44:49,113 --> 01:44:51,142
My wife was murdered before my eyes...

882
01:44:51,285 --> 01:44:54,996
...and my child was stolen to
be raised by my mortal enemy.

883
01:44:56,290 --> 01:44:58,708
Montero?

884
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:02,921
Elena.

885
01:45:04,715 --> 01:45:06,967
She's your daughter.

886
01:45:07,969 --> 01:45:10,345
Yeah, she was.

887
01:45:14,475 --> 01:45:16,059
So...

888
01:45:17,186 --> 01:45:18,979
...you will simply take your revenge.

889
01:45:19,146 --> 01:45:20,905
No, I will take my daughter.

890
01:45:20,931 --> 01:45:23,758
And don't pretend she means nothing to you.

891
01:45:23,901 --> 01:45:24,902
She does.

892
01:45:24,928 --> 01:45:28,930
But you taught me to see beyond personal feelings.

893
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:30,746
Was that all a lie?

894
01:45:30,772 --> 01:45:33,852
You're too young to understand.

895
01:45:33,995 --> 01:45:38,081
To understand what? Betrayal?

896
01:45:38,249 --> 01:45:42,252
All the work, all the training, all the wise words, for what?

897
01:45:42,420 --> 01:45:47,757
To smile in the face of my brother's
killer while you make your own plans?

898
01:45:50,302 --> 01:45:54,180
Alejandro, I taught you everything you need to survive.

899
01:45:54,348 --> 01:45:57,100
Now I must look to my own heart.

900
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,667
Elena is all I have left.

901
01:46:00,693 --> 01:46:03,465
I am not going to lose her again.

902
01:46:06,027 --> 01:46:08,121
What about California?

903
01:46:08,147 --> 01:46:10,430
What about the people?

904
01:46:10,573 --> 01:46:13,116
They still have Zorro.

905
01:46:41,645 --> 01:46:44,632
I have every inch of the countryside covered.

906
01:46:44,658 --> 01:46:46,216
If he shows himself....

907
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:49,039
Are you all right?

908
01:46:49,065 --> 01:46:50,470
Do you have the map?

909
01:46:50,613 --> 01:46:54,240
-We'll find it.
-Is your army ready to fight?

910
01:46:54,408 --> 01:46:57,744
-No, sir.
-Then of course I'm not all right.

911
01:46:57,912 --> 01:47:01,331
I'm beginning to wonder if you want
this operation to succeed at all.

912
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:02,480
What are you saying?

913
01:47:02,506 --> 01:47:04,025
What I'm saying, captain...

914
01:47:04,168 --> 01:47:08,713
...is that I think my horse could
run this army better than you.

915
01:47:12,718 --> 01:47:15,136
I said I'll find him.

916
01:47:17,056 --> 01:47:18,515
That means I will.

917
01:47:21,894 --> 01:47:24,100
Perhaps I can save you the trouble.

918
01:47:24,126 --> 01:47:25,964
Go on, reach for it, captain.

919
01:47:28,692 --> 01:47:29,736
Who are you?

920
01:47:29,762 --> 01:47:32,720
I warned you long ago, Rafael.

921
01:47:34,448 --> 01:47:36,701
You would never be rid of me.

922
01:47:36,727 --> 01:47:37,892
De la Vega.

923
01:47:42,206 --> 01:47:43,540
Rafael.

924
01:47:43,833 --> 01:47:46,835
You were not the Zorro I saw last night.

925
01:47:47,002 --> 01:47:51,172
-That was your master, Don Alejandro.
-Yes.

926
01:47:51,340 --> 01:47:54,384
But there are many who would proudly wear the mask of Zorro.

927
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:59,222
Either way, events have been set
in motion that you cannot stop.

928
01:48:00,224 --> 01:48:02,559
I'm not here to stop you.

929
01:48:04,061 --> 01:48:05,562
Call for Elena.

930
01:48:09,984 --> 01:48:12,068
Call her.

931
01:48:13,988 --> 01:48:17,657
Captain, bring my daughter to me.

932
01:48:19,827 --> 01:48:22,036
Bring her to me!

933
01:48:30,546 --> 01:48:35,383
You cannot imagine, Rafael,
how I have dreamed of this moment.

934
01:48:35,551 --> 01:48:39,596
Night and day, 20 long years.

935
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:44,225
Really? I haven't given you a second thought.

936
01:48:45,436 --> 01:48:49,718
If I die, the truth dies with me.

937
01:48:49,744 --> 01:48:51,758
We shall see.

938
01:48:51,901 --> 01:48:54,152
Father!

939
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:56,569
Bernardo, what are you doing?

940
01:48:56,595 --> 01:48:58,223
Tell her, Rafael.

941
01:48:59,909 --> 01:49:01,973
Tell me what? What is going on?

942
01:49:01,999 --> 01:49:04,395
Tell her who her real father is.

943
01:49:05,706 --> 01:49:08,082
Father, what is he saying?

944
01:49:10,461 --> 01:49:14,923
This unfortunate man lost a daughter once...

945
01:49:15,090 --> 01:49:18,259
...and now he seeks to claim you for his own.

946
01:49:21,055 --> 01:49:24,265
Tell her how her mother died.

947
01:49:28,103 --> 01:49:31,407
Your daughter is lost, de la Vega.

948
01:49:31,433 --> 01:49:33,508
You cannot have mine.

949
01:49:34,068 --> 01:49:36,236
De la Vega?

950
01:49:37,613 --> 01:49:40,782
A woman in town, she told me....

951
01:49:42,034 --> 01:49:44,327
Diego de la Vega?

952
01:49:47,498 --> 01:49:50,208
Father?

953
01:49:50,376 --> 01:49:53,002
His name is of no consequence.

954
01:49:56,423 --> 01:49:59,759
I was told my niñera used to hang something on my crib.

955
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:05,306
Yes, she had her hang fresh flowers.

956
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:06,975
No!

957
01:50:08,185 --> 01:50:09,894
No!

958
01:50:15,025 --> 01:50:16,792
Let us finish it, Rafael.

959
01:50:16,818 --> 01:50:19,220
Let us finish what we started...

960
01:50:19,530 --> 01:50:22,073
...the night Esperanza died.

961
01:50:22,950 --> 01:50:27,036
Drop your sword or I will have no choice but to have you shot.

962
01:50:27,788 --> 01:50:30,623
Even in the presence of my daughter.

963
01:50:33,544 --> 01:50:35,878
Please.

964
01:50:50,519 --> 01:50:54,564
They were flowers.
Romneya.

965
01:51:00,612 --> 01:51:03,156
Rafael...

966
01:51:04,700 --> 01:51:06,743
...she knows.

967
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:17,707
Water!

968
01:53:51,950 --> 01:53:54,494
Lock them up!

969
01:54:49,383 --> 01:54:52,552
The fuses are burning.
Hurry it up.

970
01:54:56,390 --> 01:54:58,057
Let's go!

971
01:55:20,581 --> 01:55:21,998
Wait here!

972
01:55:31,675 --> 01:55:35,052
Secure the wagon, stay alert.

973
01:57:03,684 --> 01:57:07,103
-De la Vega.
-Rafael.

974
01:58:21,344 --> 01:58:24,013
Only one question.

975
01:58:26,933 --> 01:58:29,351
Really? What is that?

976
01:58:33,857 --> 01:58:36,859
How would you like your remains displayed?

997
02:00:06,616 --> 02:00:11,495
-Now I'm free to kill you.
-No!

998
02:00:17,210 --> 02:00:21,130
Drop the sword. Drop it.

999
02:00:30,307 --> 02:00:33,017
You really think I would have killed my own child?

1000
02:00:58,501 --> 02:01:00,628
Did you miss me?

1001
02:01:23,526 --> 02:01:26,362
Elena! Get them out!

1002
02:01:33,078 --> 02:01:35,914
"M" for Murrieta.

1003
02:01:35,940 --> 02:01:39,608
Two men. One dead.

1004
02:02:41,771 --> 02:02:43,061
You're doing well.

1005
02:02:43,087 --> 02:02:46,383
Your brother would have shot himself by now.

1006
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:43,642
Alejandro.

1007
02:05:59,219 --> 02:06:01,637
Is it finished?

1008
02:06:02,138 --> 02:06:06,642
Yes, Don Diego. It's finished.

1009
02:06:08,144 --> 02:06:10,562
Not for Zorro.

1010
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:14,566
There will be other days, other battles to fight.

1011
02:06:14,734 --> 02:06:18,487
It is your curse and destiny.

1012
02:06:20,365 --> 02:06:22,574
My beautiful Elena.

1013
02:06:25,370 --> 02:06:28,247
The world is a strange place.

1014
02:06:30,041 --> 02:06:33,001
Too have found you at last only to lose you again.

1015
02:06:33,294 --> 02:06:36,046
You will never lose me...

1016
02:06:36,798 --> 02:06:39,049
...Father.

1017
02:06:42,178 --> 02:06:43,887
Elena.

1018
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:48,684
You are like your mother.

1019
02:06:50,019 --> 02:06:52,354
Same eyes.

1020
02:06:52,522 --> 02:06:54,898
Same mouth.

1021
02:06:55,066 --> 02:06:57,442
Same spirit.

1022
02:07:01,990 --> 02:07:04,574
Alejandro...

1023
02:07:06,452 --> 02:07:08,495
...Elena.

1024
02:07:28,433 --> 02:07:30,141
And so it was.

1025
02:07:30,167 --> 02:07:33,337
Lightning split the sky.

1026
02:07:33,479 --> 02:07:35,814
Thunder shook the air.

1027
02:07:35,982 --> 02:07:39,401
And then all was quiet.

1028
02:07:40,528 --> 02:07:46,366
The great warrior known as Zorro was gone.

1029
02:07:47,493 --> 02:07:49,745
The people of the land gave him a hero's funeral.

1030
02:07:49,912 --> 02:07:52,414
The largest anyone had ever seen.

1031
02:07:53,249 --> 02:07:56,335
They came from far and wide to say farewell...

1032
02:07:56,502 --> 02:07:58,920
...to the brave and noble champion.

1033
02:08:02,383 --> 02:08:04,968
But don't worry, little Joaquin.

1034
02:08:05,470 --> 02:08:08,305
Whenever great deeds are remembered...

1035
02:08:08,473 --> 02:08:11,391
...your grandfather will live on.

1036
02:08:12,268 --> 02:08:16,021
For there must always be a Zorro.

1037
02:08:16,189 --> 02:08:21,526
And someday, when he is needed, we will see him again.

1038
02:08:21,694 --> 02:08:26,656
On his fearsome steed, Tornado, riding like the wind.

1039
02:08:26,824 --> 02:08:28,950
His sword blazing in the sun.

1040
02:08:30,078 --> 02:08:31,351
Leaping, jumping!

1041
02:08:31,377 --> 02:08:33,397
Swinging through the air!

1042
02:08:33,539 --> 02:08:35,916
Fighting like a lion, fighting like a tiger!

1043
02:08:36,084 --> 02:08:38,126
Fighting...

1044
02:08:44,967 --> 02:08:46,760
...as safely as possible.

1045
02:08:48,679 --> 02:08:51,348
Is this your idea of putting the baby to sleep?

1046
02:08:58,898 --> 02:09:01,316
Sleep tight, my son.

1047
02:09:07,740 --> 02:09:13,495
When I sleep, I will dream of this dashing rogue, Zorro.

1048
02:09:14,038 --> 02:09:16,998
But what face shall I give him?

1049
02:09:17,750 --> 02:09:21,044
He has been many different men...

1050
02:09:21,212 --> 02:09:24,714
...but he has loved you as all of them.

1051
02:09:28,845 --> 02:09:31,847
How can I refuse such a man?

1052
02:09:32,890 --> 02:09:35,976
Do you know where I might find him?

1053
02:09:36,144 --> 02:09:38,070
You know Zorro.

1054
02:09:38,096 --> 02:09:41,047
He could be anywhere.

1055
02:09:57,457 --> 02:10:00,125
There, there, my darling.
