<i>Quiet on the set. And we're rolling.</i>

3
00:00:33,099 --> 00:00:34,657
<i>Cody Maverick interview, take one.</i>

4
00:00:35,135 --> 00:00:36,602
Why are you guys here
to interview me?

5
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,897
<i>It's what we do.</i>
<i>We're a reality film crew.</i>

6
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:41,633
Should I know some of the questions
before we start?

7
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,276
- <i>No. They're easy.</i>
- Okay.

8
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:47,004
- <i>Can you stand on that box, please?</i>
- Oh, yeah.

9
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:51,083
Right there? What is that?

10
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,252
- What is that?
- <i>A sound thing. It's a microphone.</i>

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,682
What's up, man? I'm Cody.

12
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:56,617
<i>And you're what, 14, 15 years old?</i>

13
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,724
Seventeen years of age.

14
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,883
<i>And any other skills</i>
<i>besides surfing?</i>

15
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,028
Like what?
Like singing and dancing?

16
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,185
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

17
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:07,894
No, not me, man. I just surf.

18
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,558
- Loser.
- I just...

19
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:12,203
Cut it out, Glen. Stop, man.

20
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:13,862
<i>We're here to make</i>
<i>a movie about Cody.</i>

21
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,769
- Does he have to be here?
- It's gonna be great.

22
00:01:15,975 --> 00:01:17,806
Can I get in line now to not see it?

23
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:19,035
<i>We'll re-slate.</i>

24
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:22,079
<i>Since we're talking about surfing,</i>
<i>give us your thoughts about surfing.</i>

25
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,613
Surfing. Surfing.

26
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:28,019
- Where do I start?
- <i>How about at the beginning?</i>

27
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,119
Okay, well...

28
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:35,887
So as soon as there was the first wave,
right? There was the first surfer.

29
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,457
<i>All they needed was, like,</i>
<i>a piece of driftwood...</i>

30
00:01:41,634 --> 00:01:45,229
<i>... a block of ice or something like</i>
<i>that, and then they were off.</i>

31
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,074
<i>And they were hooked, man.</i>
<i>They were hooked.</i>

32
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:56,544
<i>Up till recent times, you had</i>
<i>your old dudes. Your hang-six cats.</i>

33
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,685
<i>These old guys used to lay down</i>
<i>with these huge, humongous boards.</i>

34
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,155
<i>These guys were the pioneers...</i>

35
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,416
<i>... but nobody saw</i>
<i>what surfing could really be...</i>

36
00:02:06,993 --> 00:02:09,223
<i>... until Big Z did it.</i>

37
00:02:09,395 --> 00:02:12,489
- <i>Could you tell us who Big Z was?</i>
- <i>Who was Big Z?</i>

38
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:17,329
<i>You're asking the right guy.</i>
<i>You got that far. Z is everything.</i>

39
00:02:17,537 --> 00:02:19,232
<i>Big Z is surfing.</i>
<i>I mean, he's...</i>

40
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,566
<i>There may well as not have been</i>
<i>an ocean before Z.</i>

41
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,868
<i>They invented the ocean for him.</i>

42
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:29,346
<i>He lived so hard</i>
<i>because he wasn't afraid to live.</i>

43
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:31,581
<i>He wasn't afraid to die.</i>

44
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,793
<i>He came to Antarctica</i>
<i>when I was just a kid.</i>

45
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,495
<i>Man, it was the biggest thing</i>
<i>that ever happened here.</i>

46
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:54,400
<i>And suddenly there he was.</i>

47
00:02:54,574 --> 00:03:00,035
<i>Just floating over the water.</i>
<i>Hovering, you know, like weightless.</i>

48
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:06,451
<i>He could've walked up to anyone...</i>

49
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,118
<i>... and he walks right up to me.</i>

50
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,086
<i>And he gives me this awesome,</i>
<i>one-of-a-kind Big Z necklace.</i>

51
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,760
<i>And then he tells me,</i>
<i>"You know, kid, never give up.</i>

52
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,425
<i>Find a way,</i>
<i>because that's what winners do. "

53
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,836
<i>He was the greatest.</i>

54
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:33,410
<i>Everyone looked up to him,</i>
<i>respected him, loved him.</i>

55
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,006
<i>And one day, one day</i>
<i>I'm gonna be just like him.</i>

56
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:51,897
<i>And I've been surfing</i>
<i>ever since I can remember.</i>

57
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:53,660
<i>And I've been surfing</i>
<i>ever since I can remember.</i>

58
00:03:54,499 --> 00:03:56,433
It's hard to imagine my life
when I wasn't surfing.

59
00:03:57,936 --> 00:04:01,099
<i>I want to get out of here,</i>
<i>and this is my ticket out.</i>

60
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:04,640
<i>I'm really good, man.</i>
<i>I'm the best on the island.</i>

61
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:10,873
<i>I know it sounds cocky for saying that,</i>
<i>but, I mean, I am, like the best.</i>

62
00:04:18,156 --> 00:04:20,920
<i>I was born and raised here</i>
<i>in Shiverpool.</i>

63
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,657
<i>Lived here my whole life.</i>

64
00:04:24,829 --> 00:04:28,458
<i>That's where they sort the fish. It's</i>
<i>the dumbest thing I've ever heard of.</i>

65
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:33,502
<i>But yeah, I worked there</i>
<i>just to pacify my mom a little bit.</i>

66
00:04:34,239 --> 00:04:36,400
Good old Shiverpool.

67
00:04:37,742 --> 00:04:39,175
This place sucks, bro.

68
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:43,907
I worked my way up from the sardine
pile, then to the mackerel pile...

69
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,913
...and I ended up
on the gefilte fish pile.

70
00:04:46,084 --> 00:04:48,382
- All hard work.
- Not like some I could mention.

71
00:04:48,553 --> 00:04:50,748
Yes, this farkakte kid
with the thing on the water.

72
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,314
My house?

73
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:54,583
Over there. You see it
right there with the surfboards?

74
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:58,860
Yeah, I just live here with me
and my brother, Glen, my mom.

75
00:04:59,965 --> 00:05:02,195
He was a little, teeny, small egg.

76
00:05:03,668 --> 00:05:05,101
He wasn't very impressive.

77
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,261
Glen was the big egg,
Cody was the small egg.

78
00:05:08,006 --> 00:05:10,440
He can't help it.
That's just the way he is.

79
00:05:10,608 --> 00:05:11,700
I mean, he's out there...

80
00:05:13,044 --> 00:05:16,502
...in the water all day
shirking his responsibilities.

81
00:05:16,881 --> 00:05:20,339
You know, hatching these eggs
is a big responsibility.

82
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,816
And my brother, Cody,
he just doesn't understand that.

83
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:27,617
- He needs to step up and be a man.
- It takes a real man to sit on an egg.

84
00:05:27,792 --> 00:05:30,761
- You know it.
- Quincy, come to Daddy.

85
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:33,090
He wants to be different.
All the time with the different.

86
00:05:33,264 --> 00:05:34,629
Who's got the time in the day to...

87
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:36,289
Only six months in a day.

88
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:38,265
- <i>Thanks for making it.</i>
- Sorry. It was too good to miss.

89
00:05:38,436 --> 00:05:40,904
- Thanks for making it.
- How was it out there?

90
00:05:41,072 --> 00:05:42,801
He's the big brother.
I'm the little brother.

91
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm not touching you.

92
00:05:44,976 --> 00:05:46,466
- Not gonna touch you.
- Do you see this?

93
00:05:46,644 --> 00:05:47,906
- Don't. Please?
- I'm not.

94
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:49,444
He makes sure that I know that.

95
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:53,373
<i>I had to fight for everything.</i>
<i>Even Mom's tuna casserole.</i>

96
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:01,684
<i>I'm lucky I survived.</i>

97
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,886
It really wasn't that easy
for him growing up.

98
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,124
Like I said before...

99
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:10,394
<i>... he never really knew his father.</i>

100
00:06:13,304 --> 00:06:17,468
I'm not really the person to ask about it
because I was too young to remember.

101
00:06:17,642 --> 00:06:20,236
Look, I'm not the only kid
on the island...

102
00:06:20,412 --> 00:06:23,939
...whose dad was, you know, eaten.

103
00:06:24,649 --> 00:06:29,916
- <i>Still, it had to be traumatic.</i>
- No. Not for me, bro. Not for me.

104
00:06:31,356 --> 00:06:34,519
- <i>What's your dream?</i>
- To go away.

105
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:38,696
- To go away. That's great.
- Do you guys want a drink?

106
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:41,923
Got to run away
from responsibility and life.

107
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,362
This is unique.

108
00:06:43,535 --> 00:06:45,730
- This is not the norm.
- "I have dreams."

109
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,938
- When is this not happening?
- Don't make that noise.

110
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,103
- Cody!
- It's really disrespectful.

111
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:56,477
I would never do that.

112
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:00,279
You just wouldn't make it
out of your mouth.

113
00:07:00,452 --> 00:07:02,113
That's the difference
between you and me.

114
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,550
You know what?
I can't do this anymore.

115
00:07:04,722 --> 00:07:05,950
Mom. Look what you did.

116
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:08,490
This is for me. This isn't for you.
Why is Glen still here?

117
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,185
Oh, yeah, exactly. Mom!

118
00:07:11,362 --> 00:07:13,296
<i>I don't understand why</i>
<i>everybody's so judgmental.</i>

119
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:15,660
<i>I understand why Mom's judgmental.</i>

120
00:07:15,834 --> 00:07:19,395
<i>I think it's because she cares,</i>
<i>partially. It's also partially because...</i>

121
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:22,062
<i>... everyone else is looking at her like,</i>
<i>"Hey, Cody's just a bum.</i>

122
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,640
<i>Cody's this. Cody's that.</i>
<i>Cody's this. "

123
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:27,870
<i>Cody's me, bro. Let me be me.</i>

124
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:30,208
<i>When is that gonna start?</i>

125
00:07:42,727 --> 00:07:45,560
You know what they call me?
The dream maker. The dream maker.

126
00:07:46,965 --> 00:07:48,933
I find these kids,
I bring them here...

127
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:52,331
<i>... and I give them a chance</i>
<i>to be somebody.</i>

128
00:07:53,438 --> 00:07:56,305
<i>You know my greatest joy</i>
<i>as a surf promoter? Finding Z.</i>

129
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:57,941
<i>Watching him rise to the top.</i>

130
00:07:58,109 --> 00:08:02,341
<i>I still can't believe he's gone.</i>
<i>He was like a son to me, you know?</i>

131
00:08:02,514 --> 00:08:06,280
It was a heart thing, you know?
Can we just take five minutes?

132
00:08:06,518 --> 00:08:09,612
How's my hair? Is it messed up?
I ain't got all day. Is it mussed?

133
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:11,482
We just have a few more questions
about Big Z.

134
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:13,351
But right now
I think we're more interested...

135
00:08:13,525 --> 00:08:15,891
...in the Reggie Belafonte story,
and who could blame us?

136
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,789
But Big Z is kind of the focus
of our...

137
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:19,862
Let's get the coconut filler guy
over here.

138
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:21,658
And how about the guy
sweeping the sand?

139
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:25,633
Can we hear your boring story
about your tedious, ridiculous life?

140
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:27,498
Get your feathers off it! Stop!

141
00:08:27,705 --> 00:08:29,639
I ain't got all day.
I got a big production here.

142
00:08:29,807 --> 00:08:30,967
Roll, okay? Just roll!

143
00:08:31,376 --> 00:08:35,369
<i>Welcome, fans, to another edition</i>
<i>of SPEN Sports.</i>

144
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:37,178
<i>This is Sal Masakela...</i>

145

<i>... and we're here at the surfing capital</i>
<i>of the world, Pen Gu Island...</i>

<i>... for a preview of the tenth annual</i>
<i>Big Z Memorial Surf-Off.</i>

147
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:49,217
<i>Professional surfers</i>
<i>extraordinaire...</i>

148
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,259
<i>... Kelly and Rob tell us...</i>

149
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:53,829
<i>... what challenges</i>
<i>our surfers are going to face.</i>

150
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,758
First things first, Sal. The wave.
It's the perfect combination...

151
00:08:57,936 --> 00:09:02,396
...of beauty and danger. Even
the pros are terrified of this place.

152
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,602
Hi, Mom.

153
00:09:05,777 --> 00:09:07,301
Dig this, Sal. Section behind me.

154
00:09:08,646 --> 00:09:10,944
It's "The Boneyards."
Few surfers have ventured in there...

155
00:09:11,115 --> 00:09:12,139
...and come out alive.

156
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,911
<i>Are you trying to tell me</i>
<i>people have died here?</i>

157
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,714
- That's right, Sal.
- <i>A moment of silence for them.</i>

158
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:21,950
<i>And we keep it moving because</i>
<i>if the Boneyards was not enough...</i>

159
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:26,028
<i>... our surfers will be facing off with</i>
<i>Tank "The Shredder" Evans.</i>

160
00:09:26,197 --> 00:09:29,030
<i>Tank, nine-time defending champ.</i>

161
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,131
A role model? No.

162
00:09:32,637 --> 00:09:35,265
But I do consider myself somebody
that everyone should look up to.

163
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,034
Kids should try to pretend
that they're Tank.

164
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,677
I mean, they should try.
Good luck, kids.

165
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:44,173
<i>You never want to get in there</i>
<i>and help them out...</i>

166
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:48,080
<i>... and show them how to surf</i>
<i>and spend some time with the kids?</i>

167
00:09:48,253 --> 00:09:49,914
No, I don't want to do that.

168
00:09:50,088 --> 00:09:52,318
- Anyway, this is my wave.
- <i>Always classy Tank Evans.</i>

169
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,220
<i>Coming up after the break,</i>
<i>penguin dodge ball. Stick around.</i>

170
00:09:56,661 --> 00:09:59,994
Okay, to get back to the competition,
I just want to say:

171
00:10:00,164 --> 00:10:03,099
I'm scouring the globe
for the next big thing.

172
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:04,799
But that's another story.

173
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,967
<i>He doesn't look for them.</i>
<i>I find them.</i>

174
00:10:12,343 --> 00:10:13,867
<i>I find these penguins.</i>
<i>I find the talent.</i>

175
00:10:15,213 --> 00:10:16,805
<i>Reggie has sent me everywhere</i>
<i>on this trip.</i>

176
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,538
<i>Anyplace there's an ocean...</i>

177
00:10:19,884 --> 00:10:21,511
<i>... a lake, a puddle.</i>
<i>It's ridiculous.</i>

178
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:25,652
<i>I am on so much migraine medication,</i>
<i>you have no idea.</i>

179
00:10:25,823 --> 00:10:28,986
The stress is killing me. I don't know
how much longer I can last.

180
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,151
I have to tell you that right now.

181
00:10:34,065 --> 00:10:36,226
You gotta try
this blowhole thing, man.

182
00:10:36,401 --> 00:10:38,665
This whale dude
is giving me a brain freeze.

183
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,806
I lost a bet.

184
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:45,539
Excuse me. Excuse me.

185
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,168
Does anybody
in this entire frozen wasteland surf?

186
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:51,975
- The Cody Maverick kid does that.
- Wonderful. Thank you.

187
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:54,151
You know, you're sitting on...
thin ice.

188
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,447
Excuse me, I'm looking for...
I'm looking for Cody Maverick.

189
00:10:57,622 --> 00:11:01,251
- Has anyone seen Cody Maverick?
- I'm Cody Maverick.

190
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:05,857
Mike Abromowitz from the Big Z
Memorial Surf-Off, Pen Gu Island.

191
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,861
You came here on a wha...
You came to see me. Wow!

192
00:11:08,032 --> 00:11:12,128
- Quite a slip-and-slider, aren't you?
- You're here. What an honor, sir.

193
00:11:12,303 --> 00:11:14,669
Lovely. Wonderful. I hear you surf.

194
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:16,431
- Is this true?
- You gotta see what I can do.

195
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,302
- You can actually stand on a board?
- I'll be back.

196
00:11:18,476 --> 00:11:20,671
You're gonna see what I can do
everything's gonna be good...

197
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:23,336
...and I'm coming with you.
- I can't imagine a better day.

198
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:27,541
Ma! Ma, he came... the scout.
Mikey. He came. He's here.

199
00:11:27,719 --> 00:11:30,381
- What? Yeah.
- He's giving me a shot now, Ma.

200
00:11:30,555 --> 00:11:32,113
You want to come watch me surf?

201
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,224
- No, that's okay.
- Just this time.

202
00:11:34,392 --> 00:11:39,193
- I'm busy. I'm chopping here.
- Okay. All right, well, wish me luck.

203
00:11:39,364 --> 00:11:42,663
Cody, just be careful
of those big waves.

204
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,629
Well, anytime now.

205
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:52,102
You should have been here yesterday.
We had a sweet swell yesterday.

206
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:55,245
I was doing some layback 360s
and floaters. It was insane.

207
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:56,744
Wow! Start the whale.

208
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:58,848
No! Wait! Wait!
Just give me one more chance.

209
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:00,677
- All I need is one, please.
- You just had it.

210
00:12:00,852 --> 00:12:02,786
- Dude, please don't go.
- Tough break, kid.

211
00:12:02,954 --> 00:12:05,320
- Just wait one second.
- Better luck next year. Move it.

212
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,425
- Let's go. He's coming!
- Just one wave. That's all I need.

213
00:12:09,026 --> 00:12:12,518
<i>I've never won anything</i>
<i>my whole life.</i>

214
00:12:13,865 --> 00:12:16,299
<i>Just once I want to feel like a winner.</i>

215
00:12:16,768 --> 00:12:20,864
I used to scout songbirds. Toucans
for this musical revue in Brazil.

216
00:12:21,038 --> 00:12:23,302
Now that's show business.
Toucans...

217
00:12:23,474 --> 00:12:24,532
Hold on!

218
00:12:25,543 --> 00:12:28,307
I don't care what you say,
I'm coming to Pen Gu!

219
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:33,314
No way, no how.
This is a contest for big-wave surfers.

220
00:12:33,484 --> 00:12:35,975
Can't this blubber ball go any faster?
Step on it, fish sticks!

221
00:12:37,889 --> 00:12:39,948
No, no, no, no!

222
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:47,990
Poor kid. I feel bad a little bit.
Honestly, this is embar...

223
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,633
No, wait! Wait!

224
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,277
Did you guys see that?
He almost had my board!

225
00:13:04,248 --> 00:13:07,081
He almost had it.
Next time we'll get it.

226
00:13:07,251 --> 00:13:09,116
- Yeah, so anyway...
- Wait!

227
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:33,873
We got you. We got you.
Oh, you are heavier than you look.

228
00:13:34,846 --> 00:13:36,108
- Man, we did it.
- Thank you.

229
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,770
Teamwork always pays off.

230
00:13:37,949 --> 00:13:39,678
- I'm Chicken Joe, man.
- Thanks, Joe.

231
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:43,218
Don't you ever, ever, do anything
like that in the contest, all right?

232
00:13:43,387 --> 00:13:44,649
- I'm in?
- Yeah, you're in.

233
00:13:44,822 --> 00:13:48,724
Because that was entertaining,
in a horrifying sort of way.

234
00:13:49,961 --> 00:13:51,451
Right on, dude.

235
00:13:52,663 --> 00:13:55,461
My name's Cody Maverick,
Shiverpool. You?

236
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,965
No, I'm not from Shiverpool.

237
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:01,897
- Where are you from?
- Dude, I'm from Lake Michigan.

238
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,064
<i>That's where I surf.</i>
<i>I was the only one...</i>

239
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:07,408
<i>... around my town who did it.</i>

240
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:09,978
A lot of people thought
I was crazy, but I'm used to that.

241
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:12,342
- I know how you feel, Joe.
- You do?

242
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,211
- Yeah.
- Radical.

243
00:14:18,589 --> 00:14:21,990
- Butt freeze!
- Somebody help the chicken.

244
00:15:00,264 --> 00:15:01,856
Look out!

245
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,135
Slater, Machado.
How's it going, bros?

246
00:15:05,303 --> 00:15:06,531
- Good. Thanks.
- What's up, buddy?

247
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:08,433
Okay. Later, dudes.

248
00:15:09,373 --> 00:15:10,897
Radical.

249
00:15:31,862 --> 00:15:35,457
Dude, look where I'm standing.
I'm standing where Z stood.

250
00:15:37,234 --> 00:15:41,068
- Aw, man.
- Dude, you gotta try this.

251
00:15:41,238 --> 00:15:43,798
- No, I'm okay.
- Come on. Just one bite.

252
00:15:43,975 --> 00:15:46,307
All right. One bite, that's it.

253
00:15:47,678 --> 00:15:49,407
Yeah, yeah? What do you think?

254
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:51,844
It's not bad.
It kind of tastes like chicken...

255
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,183
Yep. What's chi-chi?

256
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:57,578
Coming through! Oh, crap.

257
00:16:02,893 --> 00:16:05,361
Oh, man. I'm in love.

258
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:08,589
Help me! I'm drowning!

259
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:15,567
What are you standing here
next to me for? Go talk to her, man.

260
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,765
- I'm not gonna talk to her.
- She's digging on you.

261
00:16:17,942 --> 00:16:19,034
- She called you crap.
- Joe.

262
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,144
- Thanks again.
- All right, well...

263
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:23,576
...this is the third time
you've been unconscious this week.

264
00:16:23,748 --> 00:16:25,579
I just don't think
it's very good for your brain.

265
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,310
- I know. Bye, Lani.
- Okay.

266
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,979
Yeah, that was awesome
how you saved his life and all.

267
00:16:32,156 --> 00:16:35,785
That was just unbelievable. Really.

268
00:16:37,662 --> 00:16:40,187
You here for the surf contest?

269
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:45,163
- Well, I'll be watching you.
- Really? You'll be watching me?

270
00:16:45,336 --> 00:16:46,963
Well, yeah,
from the lifeguard station.

271
00:16:47,138 --> 00:16:49,436
- Yeah. Right.
- It's my job.

272
00:16:49,607 --> 00:16:51,734
- That's your job.
- Are you gonna kiss her?

273
00:16:51,909 --> 00:16:53,934
- What's going on?
- Come on, Joe.

274
00:16:54,111 --> 00:16:56,375
- You were saying you were in love...
- No, I didn't say that.

275
00:16:56,547 --> 00:16:58,242
- Look, he really digs you.
- Joe, listen...

276
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,577
He likes you, though. See you.

277
00:17:00,751 --> 00:17:02,844
I love my job.
I have an amazing job.

278
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,385
Just this week, with the contest...

279
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:09,391
...it's a little crazy. You really
have to be extra, extra attentive.

280
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,754
When you have so many guys
in the water you can't miss a thing.

281
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:16,593
But you know what? I have a perfect
record. I've never lost anybody.

282
00:17:16,801 --> 00:17:18,826
Sure, there have been
close calls, but...

283
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,597
- Help!
- Oh, Arnold. I turn my back for one...

284
00:17:21,772 --> 00:17:24,104
- Just lay some feeling on her.
- How do you mean?

285
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:27,642
- Through words. Through touch.
- Walk me through the approach.

286
00:17:27,812 --> 00:17:30,178
- I'm Lani. You're me.
- You sure about that?

287
00:17:30,347 --> 00:17:33,407
- I get real serious.
- Let's not. Let's not.

288
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:35,074
- Whoa.
- What is it?

289
00:17:35,619 --> 00:17:38,213
That's it! That's Big Z's shrine.

290
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:41,790
- Remember?
- No, no. Not really.

291
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:47,062
<i>Today, the world of surfing</i>
<i>lost one of its legends.</i>

292

<i>Big Z took his final ride</i>
<i>this morning...</i>

293
00:17:50,034 --> 00:17:54,528
<i>... during a competition with</i>
<i>up-and-coming surfer Tank Evans.</i>

294
00:17:55,106 --> 00:18:00,043
<i>Z was last seen paddling into</i>
<i>a massive swell off Pen Gu Bay.</i>

295
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:13,789
<i>Friends of Big Z gathered</i>
<i>to remember and celebrate his life.</i>

296
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,149
Great shot!

297
00:18:17,328 --> 00:18:18,795
What? Hey!

298
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:22,229
- Every time.
- He's got a pretty good throwing fin.

299
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:24,560
Stop doing... Stop it! Cut it out!

300
00:18:25,336 --> 00:18:28,237
- That's like three in a row.
- Here, give it a shot.

301
00:18:30,574 --> 00:18:34,806
What? Wait a minute. Look at this.

302
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:37,413
- Don't. Stop it.
- It's a Big Z necklace.

303
00:18:37,581 --> 00:18:40,641
That's not funny. Stop.
Stop! What are you doing?

304
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:42,945
Look, everybody, it's Big Z's last fan!

305
00:18:43,154 --> 00:18:45,019
Coming through.
Out of the way. Let's go.

306
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:47,180
- You don't deserve to talk about him.
- He's a big zero.

307
00:18:47,358 --> 00:18:48,848
- Shut your mouth!
- Zero starts with "Z"!

308
00:18:49,026 --> 00:18:51,859
You'll never be
as good as Big Z, Stank.

309
00:18:52,997 --> 00:18:56,558
Hey, hey, people, come on now.
Smile on your brother.

310
00:18:56,734 --> 00:19:01,068
- Keep your girlfriend out of this!
- You can't do that to my friend.

311
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:04,741
You're getting quite a workout there.
That feels good.

312
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:08,401
Why don't you work on my glutes
a little bit? That's very nice.

313
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,107
- All right. That's enough, guys.
- I'll take you on anytime, anywhere.

314
00:19:14,285 --> 00:19:17,846
Well, then how about
right here, right now, huh?

315
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:20,354
Hey, Mikey, get this kid a board!

316
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:24,358
All right, who wants to see
the little guy take on the champ?

317
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,186
Little guys rule!

318
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:33,201
A little one-on-one surfing action
between Tank Evans and Jerry...

319
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:35,133
- Cody. Cody.
- Cody Maverick.

320
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:40,136
Cody Mavencourt. And the one
that rides the biggest wave wins.

321
00:19:52,022 --> 00:19:55,150
<i>Are you nervous</i>
<i>about going against Tank Evans?</i>

322
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,760
Ah, Tank. Nervous?
What do I have to be nervous about?

323
00:20:17,214 --> 00:20:18,545
Give it up! Come on, now!

324
00:20:18,716 --> 00:20:20,547
I'm gonna chum the water
with your head.

325
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:23,983
- Bring it on, pecker face. Let's go.
- Pecker face?

326
00:20:28,259 --> 00:20:29,590
It's mine!

327
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,604
<i>So, Cody, when you take</i>
<i>your first wave...</i>

328
00:20:41,772 --> 00:20:44,240
<i>... and the whole island's there</i>
<i>to watch, what'll it be like?</i>

329
00:20:44,408 --> 00:20:47,241
<i>It's gonna be amazing.</i>
<i>It'll be the best wave of my life.</i>

330
00:20:47,411 --> 00:20:49,811
I hope the cameras are rolling
because you'll want to watch it...

331
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:53,507
...over and over and over again.
It's gonna be awesome!

332
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:09,964
I can't look.

333
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:14,062
- Poor kid. He's... Poor kid.
- Wow! That was spectacular!

334
00:21:17,274 --> 00:21:19,834
I'm number one! The Tank!

335
00:21:54,278 --> 00:21:57,736
<i>We're trying to get the details.</i>
<i>The lifeguard just pulled him in.</i>

336
00:22:01,251 --> 00:22:04,709
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>when you take on the Tank, right?</i>

337
00:22:06,523 --> 00:22:07,717
Cody, Cody!

338
00:22:07,891 --> 00:22:10,553
- How is he? Okay? What can I do?
- Yeah, he's okay.

339
00:22:10,728 --> 00:22:15,722
I can help. Except if there's blood.
Just the thought of blood makes me...

340
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,558
Somebody help the chicken.

341
00:22:18,736 --> 00:22:21,227
- Tank, you okay?
- Tank needs fuel.

342
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:23,934
Mikey, get the board, will you?

343
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,568
Come on. Come on. Come on.

344
00:22:30,914 --> 00:22:36,045
- Did I win? I won, huh?
- You should've stayed in Antarctica.

345
00:22:37,054 --> 00:22:39,113
- Oh, wow.
- You're gonna be okay.

346
00:22:39,289 --> 00:22:43,487
Look at that.
There's pixies everywhere.

347
00:22:44,962 --> 00:22:48,454
<i>What do you think about Cody going</i>
<i>into a contest and possibly winning?</i>

348
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:49,656
- You know, I'm...
- Ha.

349
00:22:49,833 --> 00:22:53,599
- Why did you just laugh?
- Because he keeps saying "possible."

350
00:22:53,771 --> 00:22:58,208
Like it's "possible" that you're gonna
win. And you're gonna do anything.

351
00:22:58,375 --> 00:23:01,742
- Really, what are the chances?
- They're high. Aren't they high?

352
00:23:02,046 --> 00:23:06,107
I mean, they're normal chances.
It's not like I'm, like, the underdog.

353
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:21,460
Hey, Geek! Geek!
Get up and help me.

354
00:23:21,765 --> 00:23:23,232
Geek.

355
00:23:24,001 --> 00:23:25,559
Geek?

356
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:31,636
Geek. Wake up! I need your help.

357
00:23:32,142 --> 00:23:34,440
Come on. Get off your lazy butt
and come and help me.

358
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,272
- Beautiful dream.

359
00:23:36,447 --> 00:23:39,746
- Did you ever know Sheila?
- No. I don't know Sheila.

360
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:41,885
- Wait, wait, wait. What?
- What?

361
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:43,041
Who's this guy?

362
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,950
- He's a surfer. He's hurt.
- Who are all those guys?

363
00:23:46,123 --> 00:23:48,250
They're with him. Ignore them.

364
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:50,154
- Come on.
- Lani, what are you doing?

365
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:52,488
If you help him, they'll go away.

366
00:23:52,663 --> 00:23:55,188
- Hey! Get out of here!
- Help him!

367
00:23:55,999 --> 00:23:58,695
- Where do you want him?
- Nowhere. That's the whole point.

368
00:23:58,869 --> 00:24:01,895
- No outsiders. Come on.
- I know, I know, I know.

369
00:24:02,072 --> 00:24:06,406
This is an emergency. He went down
bad over the falls. I don't know if he...

370
00:24:09,713 --> 00:24:11,578
- And did he hit the reef?
- I don't know.

371
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,238
I'm not sure. I got him after...

372
00:24:13,417 --> 00:24:15,214
- What, is he your boyfriend?
- No. No.

373
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:18,946
Wait, wait, wait.
Looks like he stepped on a fire urchin.

374
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:23,282
Stepped on me? Are you kidding?
This guy was dancing on me.

375
00:24:24,628 --> 00:24:28,428
Just look at this. Broken, broken,
gone, gone, broken, broken, broken...

376
00:24:28,599 --> 00:24:33,434
This is pretty bad.
This is really bad.

377
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:36,302
- What... Cody!
- I hurt.

378
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:39,874
- You're gonna be okay. What?
- Maybe I shouldn't have taken that out.

379
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:41,943
Poison's released. Wow. Amazing.

380
00:24:42,112 --> 00:24:44,546
- What's amazing?
- That you're still alive.

381
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:48,913
It's all right. I'm gonna fix you up.
I can fix your foot just fine.

382
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:52,850
- Where is it? I've been looking...
- It's a saw. You just threw a saw.

383
00:24:53,023 --> 00:24:57,790
Don't let him move like that. He's
pushing the poison all over his body.

384
00:24:57,961 --> 00:25:00,191
- Come on, come on.
- I know he looks...

385
00:25:00,831 --> 00:25:02,298
Here it is.

386
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,358
- What are you doing?
- What is he doing?

387
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,833
This is a sure-fire cure.

388
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:10,963
I learned it from an old medicine
man. It, well, works wonders.

389
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:13,234
- What? No! Not that!
- Not what?

390
00:25:13,443 --> 00:25:15,638
What is he gonna... Gonna what?

391
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:17,747
- Come on, now.
- Geek, stop.

392
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:21,351
Let's do this. Lani, can you make
some water sounds?

393
00:25:21,518 --> 00:25:23,816
- Oh, my gosh, this is so gross.
- What is water sounds?

394
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:27,718
- Come on. Here we go.
- No, no, no. You...

395
00:25:31,695 --> 00:25:34,755
Kid, you better keep your mouth shut.
See, what'd I tell you?

396
00:25:34,932 --> 00:25:37,992
Hold his foot still, Lani. Come on.
Knock him out or something.

397
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:40,329
- I'm running on empty here.
- I'm trying!

398
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:48,075
So how you been?

399
00:25:49,112 --> 00:25:51,580
<i>Wow, sea urchin in the foot.</i>
<i>That sounds pretty nasty.</i>

400
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:52,737
Yeah.

401
00:25:52,916 --> 00:25:54,611
<i>How do you cure something like that?</i>

402
00:25:55,852 --> 00:25:57,183
You pee on it.

403
00:25:57,988 --> 00:26:00,456
- <i>That's disgusting.</i>
- I know!

404
00:26:00,624 --> 00:26:04,025
Hey. How long am I stuck
with this guy?

405
00:26:04,194 --> 00:26:06,059
- Because you know...
- Till he's better.

406
00:26:06,230 --> 00:26:10,826
Well, come back soon and,
please, bring me some clams.

407
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:12,525
- No.
- I'm running low here.

408
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:15,365
I can't keep doing this. You've got
to start taking care of yourself.

409
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:17,200
- Oh, come on.
- Bye.

410
00:26:17,674 --> 00:26:22,168
- Bring me some more clams!
- Okay.

411
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:34,751
If it's just as well with you,
I don't want to talk about Cody.

412
00:26:34,925 --> 00:26:37,018
He lost. That's it.
That's his problem. It's not mine.

413
00:26:37,194 --> 00:26:39,059
Aren't you concerned
about anybody's well-being...?

414
00:26:39,229 --> 00:26:41,993
The kid's fine. He was born in water.
He's a penguin, for crying out loud!

415
00:26:42,165 --> 00:26:44,929
- Did you see that wave hit him?
- That's the whole idea of surfing.

416
00:26:45,102 --> 00:26:48,230
- I care. I care!
- Mikey! Wait till you see this.

417
00:26:49,172 --> 00:26:51,231
Look at those little legs.
Stick, stick, stick, sticky.

418
00:26:51,408 --> 00:26:53,876
It's the way I walk. I'm constantly...

419
00:26:54,044 --> 00:26:57,013
- Boom-chicka-chicka...
- What's with the "boom-chicka-boom"?

420
00:26:57,648 --> 00:27:01,448
I can't stand blood.
I can't stand the sight of blood.

421
00:27:01,618 --> 00:27:05,452
I can't stand...
sight of blood. Cody!

422
00:27:06,657 --> 00:27:11,185
- Dude, have you seen my friend Cody?
- No.

423
00:27:11,728 --> 00:27:14,561
Cody? Cody?

424
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,328
He's not under there.

425
00:27:18,835 --> 00:27:21,633
Cody!

426
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:24,804
How's it going, man?

427
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,812
So I woke up this morning.

428
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,383
I didn't know where I was. It's never
a good place to be when you wake up.

429
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:36,746
Come on. Get up.

430
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,615
- I don't want to.
- Breakfast.

431
00:27:38,789 --> 00:27:42,225
- Wakey, wakey. Come on.
- I don't want to.

432
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,859
- How's your foot?
- My foot...

433
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:49,124
- My foot's fine, but my head.
- Good. Good. Come on, kid. Get up.

434
00:27:49,866 --> 00:27:51,595
What the...?

435
00:27:53,003 --> 00:27:55,130
Yeah, I think I got a concussion.

436
00:27:58,675 --> 00:28:01,906
You should meet my brother, Glen.
You guys would really hit it off.

437
00:28:02,079 --> 00:28:07,574
Oh, no. No. Where's my necklace?
Did you see my necklace? It's gotta...

438
00:28:08,385 --> 00:28:09,750
No, no.

439
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,048
Big deal. Get yourself another one
at Reggie's trinket shops.

440
00:28:13,256 --> 00:28:16,453
It's not just some necklace, guy.
He gave it to me himself.

441
00:28:16,626 --> 00:28:19,891
- Who?
- Big Z. When he came to Shiverpool.

442
00:28:20,063 --> 00:28:22,497
That guy believed in me
when no one else did.

443
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:24,634
He told me never to give up
and to find a way...

444
00:28:24,801 --> 00:28:27,269
...because that's what winners do.
- What winners do. Yeah.

445
00:28:27,437 --> 00:28:29,997
It's funny, you know,
what a loser I became.

446
00:28:30,173 --> 00:28:34,473
Who cares what Big Z said?
You got to...

447
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:40,276
...you know, do things your own way.
- I don't have a way.

448
00:28:42,152 --> 00:28:47,784
You do now. Just follow this.
It'll take you back to North Beach.

449
00:28:48,291 --> 00:28:51,158
Okay, nice to meet you.
Good luck.

450
00:29:00,036 --> 00:29:01,128
What do I do now?

451
00:29:01,304 --> 00:29:04,796
I can't show my face on the beach.
I can't go home.

452
00:29:07,244 --> 00:29:11,237
<i>You always visualize where you're</i>
<i>gonna be, what you're gonna do.</i>

453
00:29:14,951 --> 00:29:16,748
<i>This ain't it.</i>

454
00:29:45,348 --> 00:29:48,283
- What are you doing here?
- Here.

455
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:52,354
- Oh, man. Thank you, man. This...
- Yeah.

456
00:29:52,522 --> 00:29:54,114
That's cool of you to come back.

457
00:29:54,291 --> 00:29:56,316
- Thank you.
- Better keep that knot tight.

458
00:29:56,493 --> 00:29:58,654
You lose it during a contest,
it's a goner.

459
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:02,424
Yeah, well, I'm not going
in any surf contests.

460
00:30:03,033 --> 00:30:08,528
Well, there's more to surfing
than beating Tank Evans, you know.

461
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,237
Yeah.

462
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:14,342
Look at that.
You know what you're sitting on there?

463
00:30:15,045 --> 00:30:16,808
That's koa wood.

464
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,107
Best surfboards in the world
are made of that stuff.

465
00:30:19,282 --> 00:30:22,308
- Yeah?
- You got a koa board?

466
00:30:22,486 --> 00:30:28,254
- No, I don't have a "board" board.
- Well, you wanna?

467
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:30,516
You want to make one?

468
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:33,185
- Nah.
- What?

469
00:30:33,363 --> 00:30:35,661
I come all the way back here
to give you the necklace...

470
00:30:35,832 --> 00:30:39,324
...and I'm offering to make you
a board and you say, "Nah."

471
00:30:39,503 --> 00:30:42,233
Get off your lazy butt.
We're making a board. Come on.

472
00:30:42,405 --> 00:30:44,270
- All right.
- It's gonna be the best board...

473
00:30:44,441 --> 00:30:45,465
...you ever had.

474
00:30:45,642 --> 00:30:47,200
- All right?
- Okay, man.

475
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:48,435
Cody!

476
00:30:51,147 --> 00:30:52,239
That's cool.

477
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:55,449
<i>Joe, can you just tell us</i>
<i>why you're out here looking for Cody?</i>

478
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:57,985
You know, we've known
each other way back...

479
00:30:58,154 --> 00:31:03,023
...since, like, yesterday, I think it was.
We got a lot in common.

480
00:31:03,293 --> 00:31:05,352
<i>I never really knew my father either.</i>

481
00:31:11,668 --> 00:31:14,660
Why are you making surfboards
in the middle of the jungle anyway?

482
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:17,329
I'm just trying to understand.
I don't get it.

483
00:31:17,507 --> 00:31:21,034
Forget the 20 questions.
Let's just get the board made.

484
00:31:21,444 --> 00:31:26,245
Okay, it's just...
Are you a surfer, or do you...?

485
00:31:28,852 --> 00:31:31,878
- Very funny.
- Less talk, more pushing. Come on.

486
00:31:32,489 --> 00:31:34,855
Why are we pushing it?
Why don't we just roll it?

487
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:36,818
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

488
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:40,724
I didn't know your foot was there.
Are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

489
00:31:40,897 --> 00:31:43,923
It's not like I intentionally did it.
I'm sorry.

490
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:48,199
- Cody. The log!
- Yeah, I know!

491
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:52,433
Geek! Stop, stop!

492
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:57,641
Cody, grab the vine. Grab the vine!

493
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:01,512
- Now, pull it.
- I'm trying!

494
00:32:01,685 --> 00:32:03,482
Pull!

495
00:32:08,124 --> 00:32:09,489
Cody!

496
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,091
Geek!

497
00:32:12,796 --> 00:32:14,058
Cody!

498
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:23,371
Oh, no, no, no.

499
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:28,572
Help me up so I can kick your butt.

500
00:32:29,913 --> 00:32:34,316
- I thought I killed you. You okay?
- Next time, when I say don't roll the...

501
00:32:34,484 --> 00:32:36,611
Wait. What's that?

502
00:32:39,322 --> 00:32:43,281
Yeah, it's a beach.
Sand, water, sun.

503
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:46,121
You seen one, you seen them all.
Let's get out of here.

504
00:32:46,296 --> 00:32:48,560
No, come on, man.
Let's go check it out.

505
00:32:53,803 --> 00:32:55,862
<i>You think Cody and the Geek</i>
<i>are doing all right?</i>

506
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,769
Yeah. I hate to see him
living out there all alone.

507
00:32:58,942 --> 00:33:00,807
It'll be good for him
to have something to do.

508
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:16,391
Hey. Somebody's old board shack.

509
00:33:24,034 --> 00:33:25,262
Look at this.

510
00:33:29,139 --> 00:33:31,073
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

511
00:33:31,941 --> 00:33:34,171
These are Big Z's boards.

512
00:33:34,344 --> 00:33:38,508
Yeah, these are Big Z's boards.
He rode this in the Australian Open.

513
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,885
This is the board he rode
when he came to Shiverpool, man.

514
00:33:43,053 --> 00:33:45,817
This... l... Geek!

515
00:33:45,989 --> 00:33:48,583
This is Big Z's place, man!
This is where he lived!

516
00:33:48,758 --> 00:33:50,453
This is where he made his boards!

517
00:33:50,627 --> 00:33:51,992
Did you know this was here?

518
00:33:52,629 --> 00:33:54,256
Why didn't you wanna
come down here?

519
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:58,527
<i>And then he went up to this</i>
<i>old shack, you know.</i>

520
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:15,941
<i>And I realized, you know...</i>

521
00:34:16,953 --> 00:34:18,853
<i>... it was Z.</i>

522
00:34:42,112 --> 00:34:45,604
I could tell he needed some space
and some time to himself.

523
00:34:45,915 --> 00:34:47,780
I didn't want to ask him
all these questions.

524
00:34:47,951 --> 00:34:50,715
So I just kind of stood there quietly.

525
00:34:50,887 --> 00:34:53,355
You're Big Z! I can't believe it.

526
00:34:53,523 --> 00:34:55,286
You're alive! You're alive!

527
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:57,255
That's the respectful way to go,
I think.

528
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,857
Why are you alive?
What happened?

529
00:34:59,028 --> 00:35:01,292
Tell me everything.
Start at the beginning and just go.

530
00:35:01,564 --> 00:35:04,226
Kid! You're gonna
hurt yourself. Relax.

531
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,166
And people said you were dead,
but you're not dead. You're in hiding.

532
00:35:08,505 --> 00:35:10,132
Did something happen?
Something happened.

533
00:35:10,306 --> 00:35:12,604
You saw something
you weren't supposed to see.

534
00:35:12,776 --> 00:35:14,004
I knew it!
That's what happened!

535
00:35:14,177 --> 00:35:17,010
Are you nuts?
It's not a conspiracy. It's no big deal.

536
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,809
- What happened?
- I don't want to talk about it.

537
00:35:23,553 --> 00:35:25,043
You don't... Okay, I got it!

538
00:35:25,221 --> 00:35:29,851
I'll be over here if you need anything
or you just feel like talking.

539
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,592
Do you feel it now? Like talking now?

540
00:35:32,762 --> 00:35:35,492
- Go away.
- Got it. All right. I'm going away.

541
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:36,893
Unless you...

542
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,567
- Cody!
- Okay, got it.

543
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:42,034
I'm not gonna lie to you.
This is, like, it's huge, man.

544
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:45,572
It changes everything.
The contest is a few days away.

545
00:35:45,742 --> 00:35:50,839
If I can get him to train me, then...
Boom. I could win this with him.

546
00:35:51,314 --> 00:35:54,772
It's my dream. And I don't want to
give up on that dream.

547
00:35:54,951 --> 00:35:57,886
Winners find a way,
no matter what, right?

548
00:35:59,823 --> 00:36:01,950
A winner is...

549
00:36:04,327 --> 00:36:06,420
They see their goals.
They just go for it.

550
00:36:06,596 --> 00:36:08,689
They're not in it
for the money or glory.

551
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:12,198
- A winner is... like...
- Hey, hey!

552
00:36:13,002 --> 00:36:15,232
It's the surfer who's out there
having the most fun.

553
00:36:15,405 --> 00:36:16,736
Yep, it's a lot of fun.

554
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,265
Right, I get you. What's winning
without the losers?

555
00:36:20,443 --> 00:36:22,911
They're in it for the joy of it
and the rapture...

556
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:25,070
...and the slow-motion
instant replay, which is my...

557
00:36:25,248 --> 00:36:28,081
Head over to the snack bar
and get yourself a big bowl of shut up!

558
00:36:28,251 --> 00:36:31,015
Feels better when there's a lot
of losers around.

559
00:36:31,187 --> 00:36:32,677
Was that your question?

560
00:36:32,856 --> 00:36:37,190
A winner is somebody who doesn't
knock me off my surfboard...

561
00:36:37,527 --> 00:36:40,394
...and break it when I'm trying
to get some big waves.

562
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:43,361
Especially Tank.
He is definitely not a winner.

563
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:46,366
He's a dirty trashcan full of poop.

564
00:36:46,970 --> 00:36:49,530
Yeah, I can't remember a time
when I wasn't surfing.

565
00:36:49,939 --> 00:36:52,635
My mom put me right on there.
I think she pooped me out...

566
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:54,106
...just put me right on there.

567
00:36:54,277 --> 00:36:55,972
<i>What is it about surfing</i>
<i>that you love?</i>

568
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,407
I love being the center of attention...

569
00:36:58,581 --> 00:37:01,311
...because it's really
where I should be.

570
00:37:01,784 --> 00:37:06,084
And I love the looks
my ladies give me, you know?

571
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:10,282
The little glint. I love that.
I love holding the ladies.

572
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:13,488
- You know what I'm talking about?
- <i>I think so.</i>

573
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:16,063
- <i>Sort of.</i>
- Come with me.

574
00:37:19,235 --> 00:37:21,135
Put this curtain in myself.

575
00:37:23,306 --> 00:37:25,103
These are my ladies.

576
00:37:26,476 --> 00:37:28,910
This is Jill.
This is my lady, Amy.

577
00:37:29,078 --> 00:37:31,410
Little Suzie. Briana.

578
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:34,516
- You know why we call her Briana?
- <i>No.</i>

579
00:37:34,684 --> 00:37:36,117
It's a long story.

580
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:39,084
Shaniqua. Helga. Miss Kitty.

581
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:41,416
Jeannie. I dream of...

582
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:45,453
Theresa.
This is Theresa right here.

583
00:37:46,129 --> 00:37:49,462
- <i>Now, is Theresa, is that your...</i>
- Dirty girl.

584
00:37:50,066 --> 00:37:54,969
This spot?
This spot is for my special lady, Lia.

585
00:37:55,805 --> 00:38:00,037
I'm gonna say that one more time.
Lia. Oh, yeah.

586
00:38:00,743 --> 00:38:02,267
That's a sweet, sweet lady.

587
00:38:02,478 --> 00:38:05,140
Tank! Are you polishing
your trophies again?

588
00:38:06,616 --> 00:38:10,950
Mom, I wasn't polishing.
I was talking to my friends.

589
00:38:12,555 --> 00:38:14,318
I'm gonna be polishing later.

590
00:38:15,325 --> 00:38:17,987
<i>When's he coming out?</i>
<i>I'm running out of film.</i>

591
00:38:18,828 --> 00:38:21,456
<i>Mr. Topanga! Could you</i>
<i>tell us why you're not dead?</i>

592
00:38:21,631 --> 00:38:24,930
No! I am dead! I'm dead.

593
00:38:30,506 --> 00:38:32,337
What are you doing?

594
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,741
Hey, who said you...

595
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:38,574
Turn the board around.
Get back here.

596
00:38:38,748 --> 00:38:40,807
Come out here
and show me some moves.

597
00:38:41,017 --> 00:38:42,348
- No, no.
- Come on!

598
00:38:42,518 --> 00:38:46,181
- Grab a board and come out.
- You want to kill yourself, go ahead.

599
00:38:46,356 --> 00:38:48,654
Fine with me.
Just don't mess up my board.

600
00:38:48,825 --> 00:38:52,591
- How do you turn this thing?
- It's not a short board. Sit back on it.

601
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:54,252
Hey, watch the wave!

602
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,898
You mess up my board,
I'm messing up your other foot.

603
00:39:00,069 --> 00:39:04,301
I'm just trying to ride
this canoe or whatever it is, okay?

604
00:39:04,474 --> 00:39:08,001
Stop trying so hard! Just relax.

605
00:39:08,344 --> 00:39:10,539
What do you mean, rela...?

606
00:39:12,548 --> 00:39:15,346
Long, smooth strokes.

607
00:39:15,518 --> 00:39:18,487
- Dig deep. Dig, come on.
- I'm digging!

608
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:22,181
Keep the nose up! Keep it up!
Watch it! You're pearling!

609
00:39:28,531 --> 00:39:31,728
- What are you doing?
- Come on, please?

610
00:39:31,901 --> 00:39:34,369
Z, I can't learn anything
with you on the beach.

611
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:37,404
Well, then you're not gonna
learn anything.

612
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:40,736
- Now, come on in.
- I'm not coming in until you come out.

613
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:44,710
Oh, you're coming in, all right.
He's not even watching the wave.

614
00:39:45,014 --> 00:39:47,175
- <i>What wave?</i>
- That one.

615
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:51,650
Five, four, three, two, and...

616
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:06,697
- Don't touch my stuff, man.
- I couldn't help it.

617
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:11,033
- I just wanted to learn from the best.
- Yeah, well.

618
00:40:11,207 --> 00:40:13,801
- I don't surf anymore, okay?
- What?

619
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:15,603
What do you mean, you don't surf?

620
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:18,110
You want to learn
how to surf the right way?

621
00:40:18,281 --> 00:40:19,714
Sure.

622
00:40:19,882 --> 00:40:22,715
Then you gotta make
your own board, all right?

623
00:40:23,786 --> 00:40:26,550
- What do you mean, you don't sur...
- Can't hear you.

624
00:40:26,722 --> 00:40:28,553
- Can I ask one question...
- We're making a board.

625
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:31,215
<i>Could you tell me</i>
<i>about your board?</i>

626
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:35,023
I just have a palm tree board.

627
00:40:35,465 --> 00:40:38,298
I would have to say it's not
the nicest board in the world...

628
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:40,402
...but it is a pretty good board.

629
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:43,368
The ancient Hawaiians believe
that "mana" or heart...

630
00:40:43,539 --> 00:40:46,337
...was transferred into the surfboard
as you shaped it.

631
00:40:46,509 --> 00:40:48,636
What are your thoughts on that?

632
00:40:48,811 --> 00:40:52,110
What's up with the hair?
You could fit a whole fish in there.

633
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:54,806
My dream surfboard.
It's pretty powerful.

634
00:40:54,984 --> 00:40:58,317
You can add a lot of attachments to it,
like a grenade launcher attachment.

635
00:40:58,488 --> 00:40:59,785
<i>Anybody know whose board this is?</i>

636
00:40:59,956 --> 00:41:02,823
- I'm pretty sure it's the chicken's.
- Has anybody seen the chicken?

637
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:05,051
Cody!

638
00:41:05,361 --> 00:41:09,092
I know he's out here.
I can feel it in my nuggets.

639
00:41:09,265 --> 00:41:12,701
<i>Aren't you nervous out here</i>
<i>in the jungle? It's kind of dangerous.</i>

640
00:41:12,869 --> 00:41:16,464
Dude, the jungle is the most
peaceful place on the planet.

641
00:41:22,345 --> 00:41:25,542
- Hold it steady.
- <i>This is a dream come true.</i>

642
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:28,843
<i>This is a dream come true,</i>
<i>to be here with Z, doing this.</i>

643
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:31,009
- And it's koa wood.
- Where's the...

644
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:33,155
All the best boards
are made from koa wood.

645
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:38,353
All right, now,
I drew this pattern as a guide.

646
00:41:38,528 --> 00:41:43,261
Do you want to have your board
with a lot of rocker or just a little?

647
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,331
I don't know.

648
00:41:45,501 --> 00:41:48,527
What you want is something
in-between. Trust me.

649
00:41:48,704 --> 00:41:50,296
- I'm the expert here.
- Okay.

650
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:52,169
So...

651
00:41:52,542 --> 00:41:54,669
...here are your shaping tools.

652
00:41:55,111 --> 00:41:59,912
Now, remember, the board's
already inside there, see, somewhere.

653
00:42:00,082 --> 00:42:03,415
And what you're doing
is you're trying to find it.

654
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:06,248
- Reveal it. All right?
- Okay.

655
00:42:06,689 --> 00:42:10,125
Every carve counts.
Why are you smiling? Don't smile.

656
00:42:10,293 --> 00:42:14,286
- I'm not smiling. I'm excited.
- This isn't like hacking a piece of ice.

657
00:42:14,463 --> 00:42:16,863
It takes patience and finesse.

658
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:20,298
All right already. Can you just
give me the tools, please?

659
00:42:20,469 --> 00:42:23,029
- Here, take it. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

660
00:42:23,973 --> 00:42:26,965
- Here we go.
- What are you doing?

661
00:42:28,311 --> 00:42:30,370
If you're gonna do it, do it right.

662
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:33,709
All right, look.
First of all, with the grain.

663
00:42:33,950 --> 00:42:36,976
With the grain.
You see what I'm doing here?

664
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:40,986
You let the tool do the work.
You see?

665
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:43,990
Just like you're riding a wave.
You let the wave do the work.

666
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,358
You don't fight the wave.
You can't fight these big waves.

667
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:52,797
Long strokes. Loads of finesse.

668
00:42:53,769 --> 00:42:56,897
Find the board within the tree.

669
00:42:57,073 --> 00:43:00,167
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah, I got it.

670
00:43:00,343 --> 00:43:02,504
See that? You just...

671
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:05,003
- You just...
- Maybe I could do it now.

672
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:06,773
Move with...

673
00:43:07,783 --> 00:43:10,343
- With the...
- Can I do it now?

674
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:13,712
Can I do it now?

675
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:20,284
Yeah. I got carried away.
Sorry about that.

676
00:43:20,463 --> 00:43:22,488
- It's your board.
- My board.

677
00:43:23,432 --> 00:43:24,956
Okay, with the grain. I got it.

678
00:43:25,134 --> 00:43:27,364
Don't forget to eyeball it
once in a while.

679
00:43:27,536 --> 00:43:31,199
- Long strokes, with the grain.
- Not too long.

680
00:43:31,374 --> 00:43:33,171
Here we go.

681
00:43:37,146 --> 00:43:39,546
- You're doing it wrong.
- Will you just let me...

682
00:43:39,715 --> 00:43:42,946
I can't... No finesse
when you're in my face. Okay?

683
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,053
Just let me make the board.

684
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:47,951
- Do you want my help?
- No, I don't want your help.

685
00:43:48,124 --> 00:43:49,455
I don't want your help.

686
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,593
- You don't want my help?
- I don't want your help.

687
00:43:51,761 --> 00:43:54,821
- All right. Fine.
- I want to make my board.

688
00:43:54,997 --> 00:43:58,558
- Build the board yourself, all right?
- Thank you.

689
00:43:58,734 --> 00:44:02,033
I don't care what the board
looks like. You're the one...

690
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:05,173
...who's got to ride the thing.
- Fine. Thank you.

691
00:44:06,309 --> 00:44:10,541
- It's in there somewhere.
- Walk over there, please! Please.

692
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:13,277
Don't cut yourself.

693
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,141
So it's day three, yeah?

694
00:44:17,586 --> 00:44:20,578
I come across Pen Guans.

695
00:44:20,756 --> 00:44:24,192
I'm Chicken Joe. Joseph.
It's long for Joe.

696
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,920
Sweet, man.

697
00:44:26,095 --> 00:44:30,361
And they treat me as their king
and put me in a hot tub.

698
00:44:30,933 --> 00:44:33,561
It is, I guess, their royal hot tub.

699
00:44:49,018 --> 00:44:51,248
It got kind of hot and steamy.

700
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:53,979
But really opened up
my pores, you know?

701
00:44:56,192 --> 00:44:57,489
It was kind of cool.

702
00:44:57,660 --> 00:45:00,356
They served me food
while I was in there.

703
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:03,225
It was like dinner and a show.

704
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:17,406
As enjoyable as it was,
I still had a vision of my quest.

705
00:45:19,548 --> 00:45:23,382
Thank you. See you guys later.
I gotta get going.

706
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:26,745
<i>Not again.</i>

707
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,983
You know what else it was?
I had the board.

708
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,855
The board was fine.
The board was great.

709
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:39,258
- How's it going?
- It's going great, man. It's great.

710
00:45:39,735 --> 00:45:41,225
<i>It did look a little rough.</i>

711
00:45:41,404 --> 00:45:44,805
A little rough? The board looked
a little... It's a work in progress, bro.

712
00:45:44,974 --> 00:45:46,874
You think it's good enough
for the big waves?

713
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:50,443
I think it's good enough
for any wave.

714
00:45:51,914 --> 00:45:53,404
Hang on.

715
00:45:54,283 --> 00:45:58,743
- Okay, let's say I'm a big wave.
- Hold on. No, no, no, no.

716
00:45:58,921 --> 00:46:00,752
- Hey, where you...
- Hold on!

717
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:03,619
- Where are you going?
- It's my board, man, all right?

718
00:46:03,793 --> 00:46:06,762
Why don't you take your board
and go try it out?

719
00:46:06,929 --> 00:46:10,524
Maybe I will. Piece of junk. Watch!

720
00:46:13,769 --> 00:46:17,000
Nice ride, man.
Nice ride.

721
00:46:18,307 --> 00:46:20,207
This is supposed to be fun.

722
00:46:20,376 --> 00:46:24,107
I got three days until the contest.
I don't have time for fun.

723
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:27,113
No time for fun, huh?

724
00:46:27,283 --> 00:46:28,750
- Hey, Cody!
- What?

725
00:46:28,918 --> 00:46:31,716
Bring me some clams
when you come back!

726
00:46:31,887 --> 00:46:34,583
I'm not coming back!

727
00:46:34,757 --> 00:46:37,225
- He'll be back.
- No, I won't!

728
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:38,985
He'll be back.

729
00:46:39,428 --> 00:46:41,555
- You guys like barbecue?
- <i>Yeah, sure.</i>

730
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:43,288
Got some wood here.

731
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:47,569
I wasted my whole day and I have
nothing to show for it, which is...

732
00:46:52,441 --> 00:46:56,502
- I was just going to check on you...
- That's why you were...

733
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:57,976
...and the Geek.

734
00:46:58,147 --> 00:47:01,446
- Listen. The Geek is Big Z.
- What?

735
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:02,845
- I know.
- You know?

736
00:47:03,018 --> 00:47:04,952
- How did you find out?
- We went to the beach.

737
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,348
- You got him to the beach?
- Yeah.

738
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:09,150
I've been trying to get Z
out of that tree for 10 years...

739
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:11,691
...and you got him all the way
down to the beach in one day?

740
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:13,385
This is fantastic!

741
00:47:15,698 --> 00:47:20,795
It's amazing!
Do you want to go somewhere fun?

742
00:47:21,003 --> 00:47:25,838
Do you want to go somewhere
really, really fun?

743
00:47:26,008 --> 00:47:28,636
Unless you want...
Did you want to get back to Big Z?

744
00:47:28,811 --> 00:47:31,177
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have invited you.
- No, no, no.

745
00:47:31,347 --> 00:47:34,282
- What? Okay. No?
- No, look. I want to have fun.

746
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:36,714
- Okay.
- Do I need mints or something?

747
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:39,855
- You tell me.
- No, you won't need mints.

748
00:47:40,589 --> 00:47:44,389
Z used to carry us up here on his
shoulders. We'd have so much fun.

749
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:47,188
- It's one of my favorite spots.
- Really?

750
00:47:47,396 --> 00:47:50,297
- Boy, to be 8 years old again.
- What is this?

751
00:47:50,466 --> 00:47:52,457
You don't want to
get all cut up, do you?

752
00:47:52,635 --> 00:47:53,966
Hold on. What are you doing?

753
00:47:54,136 --> 00:47:56,400
No, no, no. I'm out of here.
I'm better off...

754
00:48:07,917 --> 00:48:09,908
It's going down! No, no, no!

755
00:48:14,223 --> 00:48:18,284
- This is insane!
- Stop fighting it, Cody! Just let go!

756
00:48:20,396 --> 00:48:22,023
All right!

757
00:48:26,468 --> 00:48:29,130
Now I'm in front of you.
What's going on now?

758
00:48:29,305 --> 00:48:30,795
It's not a race!

759
00:48:39,582 --> 00:48:42,483
Okay, wait, don't take the left...
Cody!

760
00:48:47,156 --> 00:48:51,183
- Give up, slowpoke! It's over with now!
- Not for long!

761
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:53,722
Give up now, sucker!

762
00:48:57,900 --> 00:49:01,233
- I beat you!
- Congratulations, you sure did.

763
00:49:01,403 --> 00:49:02,961
You should probably
get out of there.

764
00:49:03,138 --> 00:49:05,402
Why is that? This stuff is...
Look at me. It's so beautiful.

765
00:49:05,574 --> 00:49:07,166
Look at it. What is this stuff?

766
00:49:07,343 --> 00:49:10,176
See those things up above you?
They're glowworms.

767
00:49:10,346 --> 00:49:14,806
So you're right beneath them.
Yeah, that's poop.

768
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:28,593
You know how some stinks stink
and other stinks smell good?

769
00:49:28,764 --> 00:49:31,028
- Yeah.
- This is, like, a good stink.

770
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,189
A good stink?

771
00:49:32,868 --> 00:49:34,597
Can I tell you something personal?

772
00:49:34,770 --> 00:49:37,034
We're in the shower together.
You can say whatever you want.

773
00:49:37,206 --> 00:49:41,643
I'm serious. I'm really, really
jealous of you.

774
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:42,936
Why?

775
00:49:43,112 --> 00:49:46,980
I couldn't get Z off his butt
for the last 10 years...

776
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:49,674
...and then you come along and...

777
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,616
He must really think a lot of you.

778
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:56,349
I don't know. I've been a jerk to him.
I don't know what he thinks.

779
00:49:56,525 --> 00:49:58,618
- You haven't.
- I have. I've been a jerk.

780
00:49:59,995 --> 00:50:03,362
- I have.
- Then go not be a jerk.

781
00:50:04,033 --> 00:50:05,796
What does it matter to you anyways?

782
00:50:05,968 --> 00:50:08,664
He's my uncle.
He's the only family I've got.

783
00:50:17,913 --> 00:50:19,312
Okay.

784
00:51:21,744 --> 00:51:23,473
Z? No.

785
00:51:24,146 --> 00:51:28,412
No, no, no, don't you do it.
Z, don't do it. No.

786
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:30,449
- No.
- Let's see here.

787
00:51:30,619 --> 00:51:32,484
- I swear...
- It's stronger than I thought.

788
00:51:32,654 --> 00:51:35,987
...if you break it...
- Should've been broken by now.

789
00:51:36,158 --> 00:51:38,820
Come on! Come on!

790
00:51:42,598 --> 00:51:44,259
Look at that.

791
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:49,497
That's the best place
in the world to be, in the tube.

792
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:50,695
Really?

793
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:55,276
Yeah. Better than winning,
the trophy, all that stuff.

794
00:51:56,111 --> 00:51:59,478
<i>Tube riding</i>
<i>is the ultimate thing in surfing...</i>

795
00:51:59,648 --> 00:52:01,843
<i>... to ride inside the wave</i>
<i>and make it out of it.</i>

796
00:52:02,017 --> 00:52:03,609
<i>It's all we want to do every day.</i>

797
00:52:03,786 --> 00:52:06,721
<i>It's almost impossible to describe.</i>

798
00:52:06,889 --> 00:52:08,823
<i>There's nothing I can compare it to.</i>

799
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:13,451
<i>It's a feeling that not too many people</i>
<i>will experience...</i>

800
00:52:13,962 --> 00:52:15,623
<i>... so it's special in that sense.</i>

801
00:52:15,798 --> 00:52:17,163
<i>Then you try to remember it.</i>

802
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:20,267
<i>Like, "I wish I could remember that,"</i>
<i>or "I wish I could get that again."</i>

803
00:52:20,435 --> 00:52:22,096
<i>It's so addicting.</i>

804
00:52:22,471 --> 00:52:26,305
Once you get inside
you never want to get out.

805
00:52:26,508 --> 00:52:31,969
- Wow. That's amazing.
- Yeah, man. Nothing like it.

806
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:37,642
So, that aside, how many points
would you get for getting tubed?

807
00:52:37,853 --> 00:52:40,151
Like, what does it depend on
for the contest?

808
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:42,552
- Points?
- What?

809
00:52:42,758 --> 00:52:45,249
You know who you
sound like right now?

810
00:52:45,427 --> 00:52:47,190
I promote happiness!

811
00:52:47,362 --> 00:52:50,991
Can you see the happiness emanating
from me? What's wrong with you?

812
00:52:51,166 --> 00:52:52,997
- <i>We're live.</i>
- Good. Good.

813
00:52:53,168 --> 00:52:57,468
I have to say, I have no doubt
that this year's Big Z Memorial...

814
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:58,970
...is gonna be the best ever.

815
00:53:00,375 --> 00:53:02,866
<i>With the competition</i>
<i>just one day away...</i>

816
00:53:03,045 --> 00:53:07,539
<i>... the excitement is definitely building</i>
<i>here on Pen Gu Island.</i>

817
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:31,270
That didn't take too long.
I feel lightheaded.

818
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,668
So get this.

819
00:53:33,008 --> 00:53:37,069
On my search for Cody,
I bump into my hot tub buddies again.

820
00:53:38,413 --> 00:53:40,608
I get it. You guys look hungry.

821
00:53:40,782 --> 00:53:44,013
You've probably got
the munchies or something.

822
00:53:46,088 --> 00:53:48,352
Squidito on el stickito?

823
00:53:58,166 --> 00:54:02,034
Check it out! Dude,
have you seen my friend Cody?

824
00:54:02,204 --> 00:54:04,934
He's kind of like a penguin.

825
00:54:05,107 --> 00:54:08,201
He's got a lot of black on him,
a lot of white.

826
00:54:08,377 --> 00:54:11,869
- <i>How did you learn how to surf?</i>
- I saw Big Z do it, actually.

827
00:54:12,047 --> 00:54:13,947
<i>I don't think you were born yet.</i>

828
00:54:14,116 --> 00:54:16,516
- I wasn't?
- No, I don't think so.

829
00:54:16,785 --> 00:54:21,552
Lani? I like her when
she teaches us because...

830
00:54:21,723 --> 00:54:23,452
Smudge! Not another one!

831
00:54:23,625 --> 00:54:26,150
I think he really has to go
to the bathroom right now.

832
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,524
What's next? The board is done.

833
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:30,597
- The board is done?
- The board is done.

834
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:34,668
- Well, let's do some training.
- Finally!

835
00:54:35,003 --> 00:54:38,097
- <i>Can we get a shot of you...</i>
- You've got to get it in a long shot.

836
00:54:39,141 --> 00:54:41,632
Hey, Z! Come on!

837
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:43,744
- Where you going?
- I thought we were going to train.

838
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:47,370
Not in the water. Jeez.
What are you thinking?

839
00:54:48,784 --> 00:54:51,912
- You want to surf like Big Z used to?
- Yeah.

840
00:54:52,087 --> 00:54:54,783
I've got some tests here
to figure out your potential.

841
00:54:54,957 --> 00:54:57,482
- Let's do it.
- No, put them on your eyes.

842
00:54:57,659 --> 00:55:00,150
- Like this.
- On my eyes.

843
00:55:02,864 --> 00:55:05,890
- Take it, Cody.
- Can we do some training, seriously?

844
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,195
What are you talking about?
What do you think we're doing?

845
00:55:08,370 --> 00:55:10,395
Acting like nutjobs.
That's what I think we're doing.

846
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:12,972
Yeah, good. You're learning!

847
00:55:13,141 --> 00:55:15,166
And a big set comes in.

848
00:55:17,546 --> 00:55:19,241
Wipeout!

849
00:55:19,581 --> 00:55:21,481
- That's it!
- Take it easy!

850
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:23,542
This is getting ridiculous.

851
00:55:23,719 --> 00:55:25,152
- You having fun?
- I hate you.

852
00:55:26,254 --> 00:55:27,687
Big, you know, slow:

853
00:55:29,591 --> 00:55:32,685
He does this flip over the top.
All right, now you go.

854
00:55:34,796 --> 00:55:37,697
No joy, man. No joy. Fail.

855
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:43,331
I'm starting to see it, man. I think
I know what you're talking about.

856
00:55:44,272 --> 00:55:47,332
That's great. As long as
we're all having fun, right?

857
00:55:47,609 --> 00:55:51,807
Z, wake up. Wake up, Z. Z!

858
00:56:00,422 --> 00:56:02,390
Hey, Z, breakfast!

859
00:56:04,393 --> 00:56:05,758
Not a chance.

860
00:56:06,094 --> 00:56:09,689
- Four, three, two...
- You gotta get up early in the morning...

861
00:56:10,265 --> 00:56:11,357
...one.

862
00:56:20,308 --> 00:56:21,297
That is fun.

863
00:56:21,476 --> 00:56:24,411
- You're having fun?
- I am. Yes. Now I am.

864
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,174
Then, Cody...

865
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:28,009
...you passed!
- What?

866
00:56:28,183 --> 00:56:30,674
You did it! You're ready! Let's surf!

867
00:56:30,852 --> 00:56:35,380
Don't play me, Z. We're surfing?
Yes! Yes!

868
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:47,535
Hey, check it...

869
00:56:54,242 --> 00:56:56,369
I didn't know you could surf!

870
00:57:02,617 --> 00:57:03,845
Relax!

871
00:57:04,019 --> 00:57:07,716
Long, slow, smooth.

872
00:57:07,889 --> 00:57:09,720
- Like making the board!
- There you go.

873
00:57:09,891 --> 00:57:12,826
- All right. Okay.
- Feels good, yeah?

874
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:28,908
- You're in the water, Z!
- Come on out. Get wet! Come on!

875
00:57:33,381 --> 00:57:37,078
Lani, thank you.

876
00:57:42,991 --> 00:57:44,754
Look at that!

877
00:57:57,873 --> 00:58:01,536
- Nice! That's it! Nice.
- Great ride!

878
00:58:26,902 --> 00:58:28,699
Big Z is back!

879
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:42,483
This is what it's all about.

880
00:58:43,285 --> 00:58:45,810
What could be better than this?

881
00:59:12,681 --> 00:59:15,275
<i>I need some help</i>
<i>on this landing for the high note</i>

882
00:59:19,788 --> 00:59:22,586
Nice. Nice.

883
00:59:22,958 --> 00:59:25,051
- Is that the only song that you know?
- Pretty much.

884
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:27,695
You want to hear it again?
It goes like this.

885
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:30,591
No? Okay. I got you there, didn't I?

886
00:59:30,765 --> 00:59:34,428
I must say you were
quite amazing out there today.

887
00:59:34,603 --> 00:59:37,367
- You weren't so bad yourself, kiddo.
- Thanks to this guy.

888
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:42,768
- I just pointed you in a direction.
- Question, Z.

889
00:59:43,945 --> 00:59:45,970
- Change your mind about the song?
- No, no, no.

890
00:59:46,147 --> 00:59:47,614
Here, it goes something like this...

891
00:59:47,782 --> 00:59:50,512
I was wondering if you could come
watch me ride tomorrow.

892
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:54,520
Yeah, yeah. We'll both ride, man.

893
00:59:54,689 --> 00:59:59,353
- No, not just... In the contest.
- Contest? What contest?

894
00:59:59,527 --> 01:00:01,722
The Big Z Memorial.
Remember that one?

895
01:00:01,896 --> 01:00:03,523
I know I'm asking a lot...

896
01:00:03,698 --> 01:00:06,098
...but it would really, really be...

897
01:00:06,268 --> 01:00:09,396
...the biggest thing in the world
to me if you could come.

898
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:14,306
- You still want to be a part of that?
- Absolutely.

899
01:00:14,876 --> 01:00:19,336
- Why do you want me there anyway?
- I thought you'd want to be there.

900
01:00:19,514 --> 01:00:22,483
- I don't know why it's a big deal.
- It's no big deal.

901
01:00:22,784 --> 01:00:24,581
Why won't you come?

902
01:00:24,819 --> 01:00:26,081
- I'm not coming.
- Why?

903
01:00:26,254 --> 01:00:28,051
- Give it a rest.
- It's getting cold, guys.

904
01:00:28,223 --> 01:00:29,781
- Tell me why you're hiding.
- Hiding?

905
01:00:29,958 --> 01:00:32,324
- Why are you hiding?
- I'll have to eat all this by myself.

906
01:00:32,494 --> 01:00:34,621
Why didn't you come back
after you fell off the wave?

907
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:37,824
That wave.

908
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:44,799
<i>That last day, winning had</i>
<i>become everything to me.</i>

909
01:00:45,140 --> 01:00:46,767
<i>I knew I was gonna beat Tank.</i>

910
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:54,242
<i>But then, you know,</i>
<i>he starts to surf circles around me.</i>

911
01:00:54,416 --> 01:00:57,476
<i>I saw what he was doing.</i>
<i>I couldn't do what he was doing.</i>

912
01:00:58,286 --> 01:01:00,584
<i>Times had changed.</i>

913
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,523
<i>I didn't want to walk back</i>
<i>on that beach with all my fans there.</i>

914
01:01:04,693 --> 01:01:09,153
<i>A loser. Everyone looking</i>
<i>at Big Z, the loser, the has-been.</i>

915
01:01:09,731 --> 01:01:11,392
<i>So...</i>

916
01:01:19,641 --> 01:01:22,542
Big Z's dead,
and that's how it's gonna stay.

917
01:01:23,178 --> 01:01:25,339
Let me play you that song.

918
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:29,517
What about "never give up"?
What about "find a way"?

919
01:01:29,851 --> 01:01:34,788
- You're giving up. You're giving up!
- Yeah, I'm giving up. That's my way.

920
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:38,521
- Giving up.
- I thought you were the one guy.

921
01:01:38,693 --> 01:01:41,662
You don't like it, find your own way.

922
01:01:43,431 --> 01:01:44,955
Leave me out of it.

923
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:47,359
Leave me out of it.

924
01:02:14,929 --> 01:02:17,420
I messed up.
I'm just...

925
01:02:17,632 --> 01:02:19,623
I'm... not good.

926
01:02:20,034 --> 01:02:22,764
This is when I needed someone.
I needed him.

927
01:02:23,805 --> 01:02:26,706
It's hard enough
losing one dad, but...

928
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:30,210
- <i>What do you mean by...?</i>
- Nothing.

929
01:02:30,412 --> 01:02:32,710
Nothing, man. Forget it.

930
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,593
Peaceful. Peaceful.
I'm in peace. I come in peace.

931
01:02:49,798 --> 01:02:50,958
- Cody!
- Joe!

932
01:02:51,366 --> 01:02:54,665
- I've been looking everywhere for you!
- You've been looking for me?

933
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:57,669
I didn't lose you on the whale.
I'm not gonna lose you now.

934
01:02:57,839 --> 01:03:01,275
- Thank you. Seriously, thank you.
- Radical.

935
01:03:03,511 --> 01:03:05,979
They're starting!
Cody, we gotta go! Come on!

936
01:03:06,181 --> 01:03:07,648
Wait a minute. Joe?

937
01:03:07,816 --> 01:03:08,908
<i>Surfers riding...</i>

938
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:12,109
I'm sorry. Watch this, dude.
I can speak their language.

939
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:19,221
I totally need my board. I don't
know where it is. I gotta go find it.

940
01:03:19,394 --> 01:03:21,589
- I'll see you in the lineup.
- See you, Joe.

941
01:03:21,763 --> 01:03:24,288
- This is gonna be fun, huh?
- See you.

942
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:29,597
<i>The tenth annual Big Z

Twenty.

- Mike.

950

You're gonna kill yourself.
Don't do this to yourself.

951
01:03:51,092 --> 01:03:52,423
Look what happened last time.

952
01:03:53,127 --> 01:03:55,391
- It's good to see you back.
- Are you serious?

953
01:03:55,563 --> 01:03:57,087
You're gonna be
a real crowd pleaser.

Yeah. I know. I can't even...

1002

It's too much right now.

1003
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:33,169
- Well, that's all you came for.
- What?

1004
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:36,441
- What is that supposed to mean?
- You made it pretty clear last night...

1005
01:07:36,617 --> 01:07:38,676
...that winning's more important
to you than Z or me.

1006
01:07:38,853 --> 01:07:41,253
But, hey, maybe you'll get to take
your stupid trophy home.

1007
01:07:41,422 --> 01:07:43,822
- Lani. Come on.
- Come here, you!

1008
01:07:44,292 --> 01:07:45,623
How about this, huh?

1009
01:07:45,793 --> 01:07:50,856
Let me tell you something. You win
this thing, we're going places!

1010
01:07:51,065 --> 01:07:53,966
Look at this kid.
He is a champ!

1011
01:08:03,544 --> 01:08:07,708
Tank, nine-time defending champion.
He will roll on you.

1012
01:08:07,882 --> 01:08:11,374
<i>Expect him to win this thing. It's</i>
<i>basically a contest for second place.</i>

First, I'm gonna take you down.
Then I'm gonna fry the chicken.

1014

<i>not paying attention.</i>

1024
01:09:04,906 --> 01:09:07,136
<i>And there's the outside rail.</i>
<i>Evans goes down.</i>

1025
01:09:07,308 --> 01:09:11,836
<i>And it's Maverick with this new-school</i>
<i>move. We'll call it "The Maverick."</i>

1026
01:09:17,652 --> 01:09:20,815
<i>And look at this.</i>
<i>Maverick scoring big.</i>

1027
01:09:21,889 --> 01:09:26,326
Oh, it's so cute.
It's got little paws and the whiskers.

1028
01:09:29,297 --> 01:09:32,130
<i>Chicken Joe</i>

01:09:37,672 --> 01:09:38,900
I'm flying!

1031
01:09:40,775 --> 01:09:45,576
<i>Maverick and Joe tied, and no score</i>
<i>for Tank Evans? Unbelievable.</i>

1032
01:09:47,181 --> 01:09:51,049
<i>Surfers, this is your final wave!</i>

1033
01:09:51,219 --> 01:09:55,553
- Joe, this is it. This wave wins it.
- Yeah, man!

1034
01:09:57,558 --> 01:10:01,892
<i>This wave is stacking up</i>
<i>to be a beautiful tube.</i>

1035
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,761
<i>Maverick should score big</i>
<i>on this one!</i>

1036
01:10:07,602 --> 01:10:09,934
<i>But wait! Evans drops in.</i>

1037
01:10:10,104 --> 01:10:13,699
<i>It looks like Evans</i>
<i>is gonna take out the chicken.</i>

1038
01:10:19,113 --> 01:10:20,444
<i>What's Maverick doing?</i>

1039
01:10:20,615 --> 01:10:23,516
- Go, Joe, go!
- Got it! Let's go!

1040
01:10:23,684 --> 01:10:26,585
<i>I don't believe this.</i>
<i>This contest was Maverick's to win.</i>

1041
01:10:26,787 --> 01:10:30,518
<i>Now Evans pushing Maverick out</i>
<i>of bounds and into The Boneyards.</i>

1042
01:10:43,237 --> 01:10:46,070
- Tank, look out!
- You look out!

1043
01:11:21,442 --> 01:11:22,431
Code!

1044
01:11:24,979 --> 01:11:25,968
Z!

1045
01:11:30,117 --> 01:11:32,017
- Cody, come on.
- Z!

1046
01:11:32,186 --> 01:11:35,952
Paddle! Come on! Dig! Faster!
Come on. Dig!

1047
01:11:37,191 --> 01:11:39,591
Don't dig! Don't dig!

1048
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:40,852
What?

1049
01:11:41,529 --> 01:11:44,054
Let the wave carry you!

1050
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:46,360
You're gonna have to time it!

1051
01:11:46,901 --> 01:11:50,029
You're gonna come right here,
right to me!

1052
01:11:53,574 --> 01:11:55,565
Five... four...

1053
01:11:55,810 --> 01:11:58,404
Three... two... one.

1054
01:12:03,484 --> 01:12:04,951
Z!

1055
01:12:20,234 --> 01:12:21,792
Where's Cody?

1056
01:12:26,173 --> 01:12:28,232
Don't touch it! Don't touch that!

1057
01:12:28,409 --> 01:12:31,503
This is a reminder
of the young surfer...

1058
01:12:31,679 --> 01:12:36,742
...who gave his life
for the sport he loved.

1059
01:12:40,955 --> 01:12:42,752
There you are.

1060
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:50,827
I can't believe it! I can't believe it.

1061
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:53,364
You came back.

1062
01:12:53,868 --> 01:12:56,530
You saved my life, man.
Thank you.

1063
01:12:56,704 --> 01:13:00,071
Hey, hey, come on.
You're gonna tip us!

1064
01:13:01,909 --> 01:13:04,537
Well, I lost.

1065
01:13:06,213 --> 01:13:07,908
Me too.

1066
01:13:10,051 --> 01:13:13,043
Come on. Let's go, loser.

1067
01:13:13,888 --> 01:13:15,253
You want to help me out here?

1068
01:13:15,423 --> 01:13:20,554
You know the routine. Come on. Long.
That's it. Smooth, you know. Come on.

1069
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:25,889
Young Joey MacEnroe
was a beacon for a new generation.

1070
01:13:26,067 --> 01:13:29,036
May he rest in peace.

1071
01:13:30,938 --> 01:13:33,998
So, what am I bid for the board?
Who'll give me 30? 30, come on.

1072
01:13:34,175 --> 01:13:36,336
- Don't touch his stuff, man.
- Pal, if you want to bid...

1073
01:13:36,510 --> 01:13:38,705
- Give me that.
- Hey...!

1074
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:46,181
Hey. Hey, everyone.

1075
01:13:47,188 --> 01:13:49,486
- How you been?
- Oh, my gosh!

1076
01:13:49,690 --> 01:13:51,851
- Yeah...
- Hey, man, that's Z.

1077
01:13:52,059 --> 01:13:53,617
...that's me.

1078
01:13:53,794 --> 01:13:56,024
Skank, what's happening, man?

1079
01:13:56,197 --> 01:13:58,859
Got a little sand
in your egg sac there, fella.

1080
01:13:59,033 --> 01:14:01,365
- Where have you been, Z?
- What happened?

1081
01:14:02,236 --> 01:14:03,567
Oh, you know...

1082
01:14:05,539 --> 01:14:10,533
...I got lost for a little while.
But that kid there, Cody...

1083
01:14:11,745 --> 01:14:14,578
...he pointed the way back.

1084
01:14:25,426 --> 01:14:27,621
Could you please shut that off?
Could you give me a minute?

1085
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:35,935
Check it out! How about this?

1086
01:14:36,103 --> 01:14:38,571
You want to talk about talent scout?
People find talent.

1087
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:44,438
I bring them back from the dead.
The now living legend, ladies and...

1088
01:14:44,612 --> 01:14:45,943
- Shut up.
- What? Shut up?

1089
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:50,106
I'm not a legend. I'm a guy looking for
some nice waves, some good friends.

1090
01:14:50,618 --> 01:14:54,247
Hey, guys, the swell is happening
over on the north shore!

1091
01:14:54,421 --> 01:14:55,786
I'm right behind you, Z.

1092
01:14:55,956 --> 01:14:57,287
Ouch, that hurt.

1093
01:14:59,426 --> 01:15:03,692
Come back here!
You don't just walk away! Come on!

1094
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:06,430
He's taking this loss pretty hard.

1095
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:09,569
Tank, how does it feel
to lose after nine time...

1096
01:15:11,205 --> 01:15:14,436
I wasn't kissing her.
You can't have her!

1097
01:15:17,978 --> 01:15:18,967
Can we get a few words?

1098
01:15:19,146 --> 01:15:21,808
You gave up the trophy to help Joe.
What's that about?

1099
01:15:21,982 --> 01:15:24,883
You know, Rob,
that's what friends do.

1100
01:15:25,052 --> 01:15:28,180
- How's it feel to win, Joe?
- I won?

1101
01:15:28,355 --> 01:15:31,654
Come on! I'll tell my mom.
Gimme. Gimme!

1102
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:36,194
Oh, Lia! Oh, Lia.

1103
01:15:36,363 --> 01:15:39,958
Don't you walk away from me!
I am Reggie Belafon...

1104
01:15:41,468 --> 01:15:44,995
Turn that thing off.
Mikey! You are so fired!

1105
01:15:45,606 --> 01:15:48,234
I can't imagine a better day.

1106
01:15:54,415 --> 01:15:58,408
Dude, this... This whole
experience has just been...

1107
01:15:58,619 --> 01:16:01,520
It's amazing. Z?

1108
01:16:01,689 --> 01:16:06,592
I don't think I've ever had
a better friend to me in my life.

1109
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:10,423
<i>It's just really cool</i>
<i>to have everything I need.</i>

1110
01:16:11,298 --> 01:16:13,766
- Don't do it. Help!
- Arnold!

1111
01:16:13,934 --> 01:16:17,335
To be honest, man, I'm kind of, like,
bored of talking about myself.

1112
01:16:17,504 --> 01:16:21,167
So, is that cool?
You guys got what you need?

1113
01:16:21,342 --> 01:16:23,640
- <i>We got it.</i>
- All right. Be good!

1114
01:16:32,253 --> 01:16:33,777
Cowabunga!

1115
01:17:41,822 --> 01:17:43,756
Of course we're proud of him!

1116
01:17:43,924 --> 01:17:45,755
What mother wouldn't be
proud of him?

1117
01:17:45,926 --> 01:17:48,190
We're so full of proudness.

1118
01:17:48,362 --> 01:17:50,262
You know what?
He followed his dream...

1119
01:17:50,431 --> 01:17:54,197
...and he went out there, and now
he's coming home with the trophy.

1120
01:17:54,368 --> 01:17:56,359
I can't wait to see his trophy.

1121
01:17:56,537 --> 01:17:58,528
<i>There's not really a trophy.</i>

1122
01:17:59,273 --> 01:18:01,707
Is there, like, a big shell
or something like that?

1123
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:04,605
<i>There's no shell. There's no trophy.</i>
<i>Well, he didn't win.</i>

1124
01:18:04,778 --> 01:18:05,802
What?

1125
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,172
How bad was it?
Did he get smoked?

1126
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:12,546
- He was in the finals.
- Second place? That's losing.

1127
01:18:12,720 --> 01:18:15,052
- Winning is not everything, Glen.
- Right.

1128
01:18:15,222 --> 01:18:16,712
Look at what Cody did...

1129
01:18:16,890 --> 01:18:19,051
Go back to the
"winning isn't everything" thing.

1130
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,557
That doesn't compute, really.

1131
01:18:21,729 --> 01:18:27,224
You know what, Glen? I really hope
someday you can be more like Cody.

1132
01:18:27,701 --> 01:18:29,168
This interview is over.

1133
01:24:59,826 --> 01:25:02,226
Remember when were talking
about you leaving? That was great.

1134
01:25:02,395 --> 01:25:04,022
Remember when
you were gonna go?

1135
01:25:04,197 --> 01:25:06,222
- <i>We were gonna</i> go...
- You should still go.

1136
01:25:06,466 --> 01:25:07,524
<i>It's technical equipment.</i>

1137
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:11,694
I know what I'm doing. I can unplug
one of your little Hollywood devices.

1138
01:25:12,205 --> 01:25:14,503
The lighting thing,
whatever you call that...

1139
01:25:14,674 --> 01:25:16,539
...and then the microphone thing.

1140
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,041
Go back to Hollywood.

1141
01:25:18,211 --> 01:25:19,701
Cody would never do this.

1142
