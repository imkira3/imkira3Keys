NARRATOR: <i>Long ago,</i>
<i>in the faraway land of ancient Greece,</i>

3
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:44,929
<i>there was a golden age of powerful
gods and extraordinary heroes.</i>

4
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:50,885
<i>And the greatest and strongest of all
these heroes was the mighty Hercules.</i>

5
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:54,472
<i>But what is the measure of a true hero?</i>

6
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,559
<i>- That is what our story is...</i>
- Will you listen to him?

7
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:00,565
He's makin' the story sound like
some Greek tragedy.

8
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:04,239
- Lighten up, dude.
- We'll take it from here, darling.

NARRATOR: <i>You go, girl.</i>

10
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:13,658
We are the Muses, goddesses of
the arts and proclaimers of heroes.

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,538
Heroes like Hercules.

12
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:17,585
Honey, you mean "Hunk-ules."

13
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,914
Ooh, I'd like to make
some sweet music with him...

14
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:26,972
Our story actually begins long before
Hercules, many aeons ago.

15
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,554
<i>Ah</i>

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:31,850
<i>Back when the world was new</i>

17
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,769
<i>The planet Earth was down on its luck</i>

18
00:01:34,845 --> 00:01:40,693
<i>And everywhere gigantic brutes
called Titans ran amok</i>

19
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,941
<i>It was a nasty place</i>

20
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:46,945
<i>There was a mess
wherever you stepped</i>

21
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:52,281
<i>Where chaos reigned and the
earthquakes and volcanoes never slept</i>

22
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,363
Say it, girlfriend!

23
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,074
<i>And then along came Zeus</i>

24
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:57,956
<i>- He hurled his thunderbolt</i>
- CHORUS: <i>He zapped</i>

25

<i>- Locked those suckers in a vault
- They're trapped</i>

26
00:02:01,038 --> 00:02:05,418
<i>And on his own
stopped chaos in its tracks</i>

27
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,968
<i>And that's the gospel truth</i>

28
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:11,550
<i>The guy was too "Type A" to just relax</i>

29
00:02:11,632 --> 00:02:13,509
<i>And that's the world's first dish</i>

30
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:14,593
Yeah, baby.

31
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:17,475
<i>Zeus tamed the globe
while still in his youth</i>

32

<i>Though, honey it may seem impossible</i>

33
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,819
<i>That's the gospel truth</i>

34
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:28,525

And smooth as sweet vermouth</i>

it may seem impossible</i>

01:19:07,493 --> 01:19:11,248
a friend of yours who's dying to see me.

- Meg.

Meg.

you just can't change.

(HADES YELLING)

1415
01:20:29,450 --> 01:20:31,828
We were so close!

1416
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,412
So close.

1417
01:20:33,495 --> 01:20:35,372
We tripped at the finish line. Why?

1418
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:39,427
Because our little nut, Meg,
has to go all noble.

01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:48,811
Wonderboy, you are too much.

1422
01:20:48,886 --> 01:20:52,732
- Let her go.
- Get a grip.

Come here, come here.
Let me show you around.

Hmph. Well, well.
It's a small underworld after all. Huh?

1425
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:02,490
Meg! Ahhh!

1426
01:21:02,566 --> 01:21:04,364
No, no, no. Mustn't touch.

1427
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,992
You see, Meg's
running with a new crowd these days.

1428
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,955
And not a very lively one, at that.

1429
01:21:10,783 --> 01:21:14,037
You like making deals.
Take me in Meg's place.

1430
01:21:14,119 --> 01:21:19,717
Well. The son of my hated rival
trapped forever in a river of death.

- Going once.
- Is there a downside to this?

- Going twice!
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

You get her out. She goes, you stay.

1434

You know what slipped my mind?

1435
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,432
You'll be dead
before you can get to her.

1436
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,109
That's not a problem, is it?

1437
01:22:03,460 --> 01:22:04,461
Oh!

You can't do this to me. You can't...

Okay. Well, I deserved that.
Herc, Herc, Herc. Can we talk?

Your dad, he's a fun guy, right?

1448
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:43,425
So maybe you could
put in a word with him,

1449
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,798
and he'd kinda blow this
whole thing off, you know?

Get your slimy souls off me!

He's not gonna be happy
when he gets outta there.

1455

You mean, if he gets outta there.

1456

- If. If is good.
- HADES: Taxi!

Fine work, my boy! You've done it!

You're a true hero.

1474
01:24:38,156 --> 01:24:42,377
You were willing to give your life
to rescue this young woman.

1475
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:46,207
For a true hero isn't measured
by the size of his strength,

1476
01:24:46,290 --> 01:24:49,260
but by the strength of his heart.

Now, at last, my son,

1478

A life without Meg,
