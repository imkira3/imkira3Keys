1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.

2
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,950
In the year of 2046,

3
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,310
using a device called Neuro Linker,

4
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,970
people can access the virtual world in the network.

5
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:49,870
Haruyuki, a pitiful errand boy

6
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:54,290
was approached by the famous Kuroyukihime and received a certain program.

7
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,890
I'm about to give your Neuro Linker

8
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,030
a special application.

9
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:11,410
This program will change your world.

10
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,690
Accelerated...

11
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,170
An accelerated world?

12
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,210
This is called Brain Burst.

13
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:50,330
It can accelerate a person's consciousness into 1,000 times faster.

14
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,370
Now, say it!

15
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,530
Burst Link!

16
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,330
Burst Link!

17
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,430
In short,

18
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:01,630
it can alter 1 second into 1/1,000 second of the real world.

19
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,610
After knowing the existence of the accelerated world,

20
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,870
he pledged to fight for her and became Kuroyukihime's personal knight.

21
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,770
Don't you want to accelerate further, boy?

22
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:20,030
This is the story of a young boy who struggled to be faster than anyone else.

23
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,630
I will make you tremble with my loud-ass motorcycle.

24
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,770
Here goes!

25
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:36,710
Accelerating costs Burst Point acquired from fighting other players.

26
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,010
If your Burst Point reaches zero,

27
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:44,390
Brain Burst will be uninstalled automatically and can't be installed anymore.

28
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,050
Furthermore, the memories of Burst Linker will be erased as well.

29
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,630
If this is the real world, he must have a weakness!

30
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:00,650
That's it!

31
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,710
Let's dance more!

32
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:07,570
Please Silver Crow, I need to be faster.

33
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,450
Faster than him!

34
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,210
Even if I don't believe in myself...

35
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:22,510
It seems that your heart has given you the control of your body.

36
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,810
What would you do if you don't believe in yourself?

37
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,370
Do you think you can stop my Monster Machine?

38
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:32,450
...I believe in her words!

39
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,350
A little more!

40
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,230
Now!

41
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,150
What?

42
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,130
To keep accelerating, you need to keep fighting and keep winning.

43
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,710
Congratulations for you first victory.

44
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:05,370
At this pace, I'm sure you will level up soon enough.

45
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,390
Thank you very much.

46
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,570
But I still need much to level up.

47
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:14,090
That's right. It's a long way to go.

48
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:16,770
To be able to access full feature in Burst Linker,

49
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:19,510
you need to reach level 4 first.

50
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:24,210
Upon reaching level 7 and 8, you can gather other people and make a certain group.

51
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,890
Group?

52
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,410
It's the same as any other online game.

53
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:31,850
We call it as "Legion".

54
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,750
Currently, the accelerated world is divided into 6 major Legions.

55
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,610
Each of them is led by six level-9 Burst Linkers.

56
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:48,650
There are six Kings; blue, red, yellow, green, purple, and white.

57
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:52,750
I've never heard of a game that there are only six people with the highest level.

58
00:04:53,230 --> 00:04:56,530
I've never said that level 9 is the highest.

59
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,790
So there is also a level 10? How...

60
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:07,010
This Brain Burst 2039 has been running for 7 years without no clear origin.

61
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,470
It's stated that no one has ever reached level 10.

62
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:15,990
Is it because the required points are so high?

63
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,330
I think you misunderstand.

64
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,550
One must defeat all other level 9 players.

65
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,670
Losing only one means all points will be depleted

66
00:05:24,670 --> 00:05:27,270
and the Brain Burst will be uninstalled forcefully.

67
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,470
In summer two years ago,

68
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,310
the Kings helped each other to reach level 9

69
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,010
until they received a system message concerning the cruel rule to reach level 10.

70
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,770
So they considered another option.

71
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,310
For now, the Kings choose to ceasefire.

72
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:50,090
Under an agreement, they split the accelerated world into their own territories.

73
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,670
What a laugh. They have beaten many other Linkers only to sit still at level 9.

74
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:02,830
So, is your objective now to oppose the six Kings?

75
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,850
No, I've already done that.

76
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,350
Between those six Kings, there was a seventh.

77
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:14,870
These seven players struggled to become stronger together as rivals.

78
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,070
The Black King betrayed the other six at that night two years ago.

79
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,230
The Black King.

80
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,510
Yes, it was me.

81
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:30,850
The Black King, Black Lotus, has broken the peace treaty and become their mortal enemy.

82
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:35,070
Kuroyukihime, who became the criminal at large in the accelerated world

83
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:40,030
had been using a disguise to conceal her identity while accessing the network.

84
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:49,210
But one day, she was ambushed by a blue player, Cyan Pile.

85
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:50,670
Haruyuki helped her escape.

86
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,910
The person which was most likely involved...

87
00:06:58,650 --> 00:07:02,230
Kurashima Chiyuri, Haruyuki's childhood friend.

88
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,370
Excuse me.

89
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,610
When Haruyuki tried to prove that Chiyuri is innocent,

90
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,670
he found a virus in her Neuro Linker.

91
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:22,890
That's...

92
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:28,410
A lag?

93
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:32,490
This is...

94
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:36,070
a backdoor!

95
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,470
Burst Link!

96
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:55,990
The guy who used to bully Haruyuki ambushed them together.

97
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,370
In a moment,

98
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:00,050
as the time stopped in the accelerated world,

99
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:01,610
Kuroyukihime confessed to Haruyuki.

100
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,890
Perhaps this is my punishment

101
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,330
for toying with people's heart.

102
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:10,150
I've hurt many people without me noticing.

103
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,710
But... But...

104
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,530
Don't be sad.

105
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:17,930
Even in this situation, there's something that put me in relief.

106
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,050
Relief?

107
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,850
In this moment,

108
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:27,530
I want you to hear my words from the bottom of my heart.

109
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:31,750
Haruyuki-kun, I love you.

110
00:08:32,410 --> 00:08:36,690
The first time I felt it, I was really confused.

111
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:43,130
Whenever I think about you, I feel happiness and sadness at the same time.

112
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,510
Maybe this is what they call love.

113
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,910
Be stronger. Be faster.

114
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:54,310
Climb the hurdle of life. Be someone that I will admire one day.

115
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,570
No! You can't say it like that!

116
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:01,350
I want to be the one to protect you, yet...

117
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,450
I still haven't done anything for you.

118
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,870
I'm sure we'll meet again some day.

119
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,450
Senpai, please stop it! Senpai!

120
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,070
Senpai!

121
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:50,510
Since then, Haruyuki had been waiting for Kuroyukihime to regain consciousness.

122
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,250
With no knowledge on Cyan Pile's identity, he chose to stay by her side.

123
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:58,250
Protect...

124
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:00,570
I will protect her.

125
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,670
One morning, his best friend Takumu, appeared at the hospital.

126
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,650
Taku. He's here!

127
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,650
Taku!

128
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,750
Wait, how does he...

129
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:24,990
Burst Link!

130
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,150
What? Takumu is...

131
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,150
Cyan Pile?

132
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,070
So you're the one who put the virus in Chiyu's Neuro Linker

133
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,890
to peek into her memories, right?

134
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:46,370
You looked into her memories too, didn't you?

135
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,650
Even though you're not her boyfriend!

136
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,710
It sure is hard to understand women.

137
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:56,130
Compared to when she's still going out with me,

138
00:10:56,570 --> 00:11:01,250
now she seems to be having more fun taking care of you.

139
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,050
Look how pitiful you are, Haru.

140
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,330
Spiral Gravity Driver!

141
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,810
Takumu's character Cyan Pile is level 4.

142
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,610
The level 1 Silver Crow didn't stand a chance.

143
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,890
But he still stood up for Kuroyukihime's sake.

144
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,670
At that moment...

145
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,650
Senpai.

146
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,750
That's right. Strength is not the only way to victory.

147
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:14,730
Even if I keep losing and falling, there must be something.

148
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:20,030
Something that can make her proud.

149
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,770
That's my goal!

150
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,870
As the proof of my strength!

151
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:29,090
Silver Crow's true power has awaken.

152
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Wings?

153
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,390
It hurts.

154
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,770
The sky's calling.

155
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,190
Here I go!

156
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,270
It was the first flying ability in the world.

157
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:28,390
Fall down! Lightning Cyan Spike!

158
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:40,530
Haru!

159
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:43,230
Taku!

160
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:49,150
Haruyuki-kun, you have the potential to be the fastest Linker

161
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,390
even though you don't notice that.

162
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:55,090
When you know how to control it,

163
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,730
you can reach beyond your limit.

164
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,870
I can see it, Senpai!

165
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,950
I'm sorry. You win, Haru.

166
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,890
In the real world, I can't beat you in any way.

167
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:38,050
But in this world, you can't beat me.

168
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,150
We need each other.

169
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:46,930
So please, I want you to be my comrade, Taku!

170
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,970
From now on, let's fight together.

171
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:54,200
Why do you trust me?

172
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,570
You know that I lied to you.

173
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,050
Even though I've betrayed our friendship.

174
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:05,330
From now on, I want us to talk properly,

175
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:08,990
even if we fight each other in Brain Burst,

176
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:14,450
let's talk about how we feel to each other frankly.

177
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,490
So, I think it would be better if we start over.

178
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,310
Senpai.

179
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,470
Senpai!

180
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,410
I'm glad. I know you can make it.

181
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,600
Thank you for fighting for me, Haruyuki-kun.

182
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,970
That's because you told me to believe, Senpai.

183
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:05,470
That's why...

184
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,650
How beautiful. So this is your true form.

185
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:13,190
I know my hunch was right.

186
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,410
I'm sure you can rule over the world.

187
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:23,130
The time has come to let go of my hesitation and aim for the sky once more.

188
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:59,370
Listen to me, the six Great Kings and all Burst Linkers!

189
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,460
I am Black Lotus!

190
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,930
I have risen as the seventh King.

191
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:10,450
With my Legion, Nega Nebulous, will take over the world and break this peace of yours.

192
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,350
With the aid of Silver Crow's flying ability,

193
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:19,050
Nega Nebulous has revived and aimed to rule the world once again.

194
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,530
Three months has passed.

195
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:28,630
The territory battles took place every evening on weekend, where Legions fight over territories.

196
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:36,050
A battle royale with no details on enemy's level, where two teams fight over at least 50% control of the combat area.

197
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,170
Leave this to us!

198
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,610
Go for it, Haru. Stick to the usual pattern.

199
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:49,010
Leave it to me!

200
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,050
With Cyan Pile joining Nega Nebulous,

201
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:56,690
the three had been taking territories one by one.

202
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:06,130
Unfortunately, the enemies had known that Silver Crow's weakness is long-range attack

203
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:07,910
so it becomes more difficult to win.

204
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,130
Damn.

205
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,970
Repeating the same thing won't fool me.

206
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:18,310
Once I take care of your flying ability, you're just an easy target for me.

207
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,950
Even so, I...

208
00:18:26,710 --> 00:18:30,170
Even so, I want to be stronger.

209
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,670
Welcome home, Onii-chan!

210
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,050
An angel...

211
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,190
An angel has appeared.

212
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:53,830
One day, Haruyuki met his cousin in his home.

213
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,850
I'm sorry I used the kitchen without permission.

214
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,710
I thought Haruyuki-oniichan will be hungry when he comes home.

215
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,710
Onii-chan!

216
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,250
Can I join the bath?

217
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:13,070
Sorry. Just wait a minute!

218
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,300
It's okay, we're cousins.

219
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,930
I'm sure it is not okay!

220
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:27,990
Onii-chan, don't look at me like that.

221
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,610
Tomoko-chan.

222
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,270
What is it, Onii-chan?

223
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,870
You're Burst Linker user, aren't you?

224
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,270
There's the mark on your neck.

225
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,590
So you looked for info on me?

226
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,450
Even though you're just a loser pig.

227
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:04,450
This sucks!

228
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:08,110
I will confirm your power myself.

229
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:11,590
To me, Scarlet Rain-sama!

230
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:13,810
Don't you dare running away.

231
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:18,270
Watch out!

232
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,140
I will kill you.

233
00:20:48,050 --> 00:20:51,140
Her character's name is Scarlet Rain.

234
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:56,770
Even if she's Haruyuki's cousin, she had no problem fighting him herself.

235
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,470
Are you really the Red King?

236
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,750
Hailstorm Domination!

237
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,740
Silver Crow Prototype Attack!

238
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,610
Take this!

239
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:14,710
I win, Onii-chan.

240
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,030
Yeah, seems so.

241
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:20,550
Then, will you grant my wish?

242
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,270
Wish?

243
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:25,390
I want to meet your Legion Master in the real world.

244
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,190
Both in flesh.

245
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:35,530
Why did you persuade Haruyuki-kun that far?

246
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:38,390
Do you love him that much?

247
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,290
That's not it!

248
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:45,610
I'm only interested in his avatar.

249
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:49,590
Silver Crow, with those wings of yours.

250
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:52,690
I want to borrow that power just once.

251
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,570
To destroy the Armor of Catastrophe.

252
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:58,490
The Armor of Catastrophe?

253
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:11,490
VR Movie. In other words, the memories that was recorded virtually.

254
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:15,690
Armor of Catastrophe, or known as Chrome Disaster.

255
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:23,350
7 years ago, an incident occurred where low level players were being defeated one by one.

256
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:30,470
Unfortunately, it was not an ordinary battle. It was a brutal massacre.

257
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:34,830
Their consciousness faded and were brutally dismembered.

258
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,330
Then,

259
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,570
here's the cause.

260
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:45,590
Its shape and size is completely different from before.

261
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,930
Depending on the character it possessed, the armor changed its form.

262
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:53,150
But, his thirst for blood is still the same.

263
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:08,190
Two and a half years ago, together as the seven Kings,

264
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:11,570
we succeeded on defeating Chrome Disaster, yet...

265
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,910
Then, how do you explain this situation?

266
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:19,810
The fifth one has appeared and is rampaging around now!

267
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,690
What's the name of the fifth one? Which King is it?

268
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,590
He's not a King. He's just...

269
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:30,470
a member of the red legion, the Prominance.

270
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:33,110
His name's Cherry Rook.

271
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,630
Cherry was a nice person.

272
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:42,590
I thought we will always fight together.

273
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:44,130
But he...

274
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:45,530
Damn!

275
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:51,830
He went into rampage, suddenly attacked the other members

276
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,130
and killing them relentlessly.

277
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:59,450
That's why, I need to save him.

278
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:03,390
I see. Now I understand your purpose.

279
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,270
What is it?

280
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,430
Isn't that obvious, Onii-chan?

281
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:12,630
I want you to capture Chrome Disaster, see?

282
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:17,370
No way! Even if you asked me to...

283
00:25:17,370 --> 00:25:19,630
As they prepare the mission for next evening,

284
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:24,350
Nico and Kuroyukihime spent the night at Haruyuki's house.

285
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,790
Please don't look at me like that.

286
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,490
I don't have any other pajamas.

287
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:44,230
T-That's not it! It suits you perfectly!

288
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,730
Hey, do you know, Silver Crow?

289
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:50,350
When she's naked, she is actually-

290
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:54,810
Are you okay, Red King?

291
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,870
Shut your mouth. I'll destroy you!

292
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:04,290
Being in different Legions should make them enemies.

293
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:10,210
But they spent the time laughing together like best friends.

294
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,150
He's here!

295
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,970
He took a train to Ikebukuro.

296
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,030
Judging from his usual pattern,

297
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,530
that's where he will start the hunt.

298
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,210
Let's go!

299
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:35,430
"Eliminate the fifth Chrome Disaster" mission, start!

300
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:38,450
Unlimited Burst!

301
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:43,870
Is this the Unlimited Neutral Field?

302
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:48,000
That's right. Here's where the former Armor of Catastrophe was defeated.

303
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,230
By the way, do you realize something?

304
00:26:52,990 --> 00:26:54,090
Something?

305
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,510
There's no time limit?

306
00:26:57,710 --> 00:27:00,930
That's right, hence the name Unlimited Field.

307
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:06,260
You can stay here as long as you like.

308
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,390
But you need to be at least level 4 to enter.

309
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:32,640
As they pursue Chrome Disaster to Ikebukuro,

310
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:36,370
the Yellow King, Yellow Radio, made his appearance.

311
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:43,870
I see. So this is all your doing, Yellow Radio!

312
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,350
Begin the attack!

313
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:48,570
Come, Enhanced Armament!

314
00:27:56,970 --> 00:28:02,740
I'll make you regret facing the Red King, you fool!

315
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,790
Everything was actually the Yellow King's plot.

316
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,830
Silver Crow and his companion fell into his trap.

317
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:16,390
This is the first fight between level 9 Linkers after a long time.

318
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:23,850
Since the first time we met, I hate you!

319
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,510
Lotus!

320
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,390
Death By Piercing!

321
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,170
Futile Fortune Wheel-

322
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,370
The Armor of Catastrophe, Chrome Disaster!

323
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,510
How come? In this world, he should need a whole day to reach here.

324
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:08,070
Could it be...

325
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,530
He used Burst Link in the train?

326
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:19,590
Deceit Fire Cracker!

327
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,630
Devour! I will devour all of you!

328
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:40,410
This isn't a battle anymore!

329
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:47,730
As Chrome Disaster suddenly appeared, the Yellow Legion made a retreat.

330
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,370
What the hell?

331
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,590
What can I do?

332
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:04,070
Overwhelmed by the difference in strength, Silver Crow lost all his ability to fight.

333
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:09,690
Facing such a powerful Linker, he couldn't move his character.

334
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,170
You need to fight your fear.

335
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:15,590
Thinking about losing only make you weaker.

336
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:20,870
This is our only chance to get rid of him and put stop to this incident.

337
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:23,150
It's not only my thought. It's the truth.

338
00:30:23,510 --> 00:30:24,810
Because I...

339
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:26,130
Snap out of it!

340
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:30,490
I will never abandon you whatever happens.

341
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:36,010
Do you think our bond is that weak?

342
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,810
Don't even think about it!

343
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:42,430
Their bond in the accelerated world is like that of parent and child.

344
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,670
Hearing Black Lotus' words, Silver Crow stood up once more.

345
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:08,890
Senpai!

346
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,710
Really...

347
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,690
This is why I hate children.

348
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:22,490
S-Senpai?

349
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,030
Did she miss?

350
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,890
It just grazed him.

351
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:36,690
She trusted him more than anyone else.

352
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:39,630
Thanks to Burst Linker's most important bond.

353
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,610
Yes, I know it.

354
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:45,730
They are parent and child.

355
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,910
The Red King is Disaster's...

356
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:50,950
...no, Cherry Rook's child.

357
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,010
Come on, what are you doing?

358
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,770
I'm okay.

359
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,270
Go rescue Nico.

360
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,450
She's our comrade.

361
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,390
Okay!

362
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:15,590
Stop it!

363
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:25,450
If I attack him while he's jumping,

364
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,550
he won't be able

365
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,550
to avoid it!

366
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,910
How can I stop him?

367
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,670
That's it!

368
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,310
Faster! I need to accelerate more!

369
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,550
I am...

370
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:13,850
I want to be stronger.

371
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,650
That's my only desire.

372
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,250
You understand it too, don't you?

373
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,830
You want power for yourself.

374
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,250
You think I'll forgive you for that?

375
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:25,950
It's not just you!

376
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:29,370
Anybody have to go through hardships to get stronger.

377
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:31,190
That's how it works!

378
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,010
You did it, Silver Crow.

379
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:03,870
Leave the rest to me.

380
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:16,610
Transition.

381
00:35:17,610 --> 00:35:19,970
The Unlimited Field scenery changes periodically.

382
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,250
It gives a certain attribute in a period of time.

383
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:28,390
After confirming that the Armor of Catastrophe is completely destroyed,

384
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:30,850
Silver Crow and his friends returned to the real world.

385
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:41,510
What is it, Haru?

386
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:44,270
No, nothing.

387
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,530
Sorry about this, but I'll leave her in your care.

388
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,030
I hope you don't mind.

389
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:56,170
My precious collection...

390
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,790
Welcome home, Onii-chan!

391
00:36:01,590 --> 00:36:06,430
Later, Scarlet Rain informed the other Kings that Chrome Disaster has been annihilated.

392
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,750
Cherry Rook's memories about Burst Linker were erased

393
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,310
and put an end to the incident.

394
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,210
What's this?

395
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,570
You know...

396
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:19,610
A gift for you.

397
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:24,250
Is this really for me?

398
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:26,750
What? If you don't want, return it to me!

399
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:28,810
I'll gladly take it!

400
00:36:29,650 --> 00:36:30,830
Thank you.

401
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:36,270
It's delicious, Nico.

402
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,800
It tastes really great.

403
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,990
W-Why are you crying?

404
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:46,890
A-Are you an idiot?

405
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,290
How embarrassing!

406
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,610
You idiot! Idiot!

407
00:36:50,610 --> 00:36:53,290
I don't care if you're crying or eating!

408
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:58,330
The boy with silver wings

409
00:36:58,330 --> 00:37:01,230
met a bunch of other Burst Linkers and improved himself.

410
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:04,730
I will also join this Nega Nebulous.

411
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:07,030
Kurashima Chiyuri as Lime Bell.

412
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:11,670
Scarlet Rain asked me to help.

413
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,510
The Red King's nimble servant,

414
00:37:14,510 --> 00:37:15,610
Blood Leopard.

415
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,490
The world where true encounter happens

416
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,430
and where the bond strengthens.

417
00:37:20,930 --> 00:37:23,330
Kurasaki Fuuko as Sky Raker.

418
00:37:24,970 --> 00:37:29,090
Show me your everything, don't leave anything behind.

419
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:31,250
Kimi Akira as Aqua Current.

420
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,990
With many strong enemies to come,

421
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:16,770
Silver Crow together with Black Lotus

422
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:19,010
will aim to dominate the accelerated world.

423
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,930
Yoyogi Sports Hall No. 1

424
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:30,570
Japan's Nationwide Gymnastic Competition

425
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,870
Women's Vault

426
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,270
Finals

427
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,130
Shibuya Area No. 1 - Region Battle

428
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:00,150
Nega Nebulous VS Great Wall

429
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:10,490
Flame Torrent!

430
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:16,390
Now!

431
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:21,410
Damn!

432
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,710
I won't give up this palace!

433
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:36,010
I will make you regret facing me, Raker!

434
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,810
That brat!

435
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:43,970
Flame Torrent!

436
00:40:56,710 --> 00:41:00,350
Secret move! Pound Impact!

437
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,970
So that's your true form.

438
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:26,610
Looks like you're still rushing things, Gen-chan.

439
00:41:32,450 --> 00:41:33,590
Sister!

440
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:34,590
Maiden!

441
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:41,730
How dare you!

442
00:42:13,790 --> 00:42:15,590
They get the Meiji area.

443
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,810
We won't lose here, either!

444
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,590
While that Christmas Tree is charging her secret move,

445
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:27,030
the Decurion keeps multiplying his soldiers.

446
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,790
I think there's no Christmas tree on August.

447
00:42:30,790 --> 00:42:33,490
That's not the point! Good grief.

448
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:36,230
I can't summon Invincible here, either.

449
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,830
Rain, how long does your gun recharge?

450
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:43,090
At least 20 seconds. Why do you ask?

451
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:44,690
No time to explain.

452
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:46,990
Got it. Back me up.

453
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:47,990
Shape Change.

454
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,490
10, 11, ...

455
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:01,250
18, 19, that should do it.

456
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:04,090
Hey, I'm ready!

457
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,450
It's pointless! That tiny gun will not penetrate my shield!

458
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,810
Damn you!

459
00:43:37,750 --> 00:43:39,130
I hate the dark.

460
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,330
There's a tunnel under this highway.

461
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,610
You should say it earlier!

462
00:44:10,540 --> 00:44:13,050
Hey hey hey! I'm gonna kill you!

463
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:17,550
Look at my bike upgrade! Nice spirit, right?

464
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:20,150
I've told you, enough talking!

465
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:24,970
Take this!

466
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:27,350
Shut up!

467
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,530
V Round Attack!

468
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:01,370
You were careless, Silver Crow.

469
00:45:02,110 --> 00:45:03,670
I'm sorry, Senpai.

470
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:11,770
The Green King, Green Grande.

471
00:45:12,490 --> 00:45:15,030
The Shibuya area will belong to us.

472
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,110
Give it up, Grande.

473
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:21,110
The cool ones don't talk back, you see?

474
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:24,670
We won't give up Shibuya that easily. Right, boss?

475
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:34,210
Whatever, just come if you dare!

476
00:45:34,530 --> 00:45:35,530
Okay.

477
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:39,670
Stop! It will become a Sudden Death if the Kings fight each other!

478
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,010
See?

479
00:45:45,010 --> 00:45:46,130
No, wait.

480
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:53,570
A transition?

481
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:57,550
It can't be. The field should not change any time soon.

482
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:09,710
What is this?

483
00:46:14,150 --> 00:46:15,950
The tower is...

484
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:16,950
destroyed.

485
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,250
This is...

486
00:46:28,810 --> 00:46:29,810
Senpai!

487
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,150
Stay away.

488
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:02,870
Senpai, what was that?

489
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:04,730
No idea.

490
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,670
A field transition like that has never happened.

491
00:47:08,190 --> 00:47:09,190
What is happening?

492
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:14,890
Not to mention the black gale that forcefully disconnected us.

493
00:47:16,070 --> 00:47:18,810
The BB icon on the desktop looks strange.

494
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,640
The icon's grey.

495
00:47:25,030 --> 00:47:27,370
Burst Link! Burst Link!

496
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:28,690
Damn!

497
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:30,710
The acceleration isn't working?

498
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:31,350
Hey!

499
00:47:32,170 --> 00:47:33,170
Could this be?

500
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:48,110
The authorities are currently working on repairing the surveillance cameras which is malfunctioning.

501
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:55,390
This incident is occuring in Shinjuku, Minato, Shinagawa, and other prefectures in the area.

502
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:01,810
The police has not found the cause of this phenomenon yet.

503
00:48:01,810 --> 00:48:04,750
Currently, there are no reports of other damages so please stay caution.

504
00:48:04,750 --> 00:48:07,330
Umezo Junior High School
Currently, there are no reports of other damages so please stay caution.

505
00:48:07,330 --> 00:48:07,470
Currently, there are no reports of other damages so please stay caution.

506
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,570
I'm sorry I called you all during summer break.

507
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,230
Student Council Room
I'm sorry I called you all during summer break.

508
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:12,370
Let's jump straight in.

509
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,960
First, take a look at this.

510
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:32,390
According to Leopard and Fuuko,

511
00:48:32,390 --> 00:48:34,410
here's the area where people can't accelerate.

512
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:36,930
That large?

513
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:40,950
And here's the area where the surveillance cameras are malfunctioning.

514
00:48:43,650 --> 00:48:45,050
It fits perfectly.

515
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:47,470
This is not a mere coincidence.

516
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:50,830
These two incidents must have a connection.

517
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,170
The question is...

518
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:55,450
Is this incident cause by something in the accelerated world,

519
00:48:55,890 --> 00:49:00,630
or is it affecting the real world other than Brain Burst,

520
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:01,930
right?

521
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,330
If it's the second, then there's nothing we can do.

522
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:11,870
If it's the first, we can investigate the problem in the accelerated world.

523
00:49:11,870 --> 00:49:13,690
So that's our duty?

524
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:18,670
But we couldn't accelerate near the surveillance camera in Yoyogi before.

525
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,790
Oh yeah, I have an idea.

526
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:25,150
We'll dive into the Unlimited Field from the nearby area.

527
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:26,170
But Master,

528
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:32,750
I've heard it's likely that the black cloud affected every Burst Linker which was in the Unlimited Field.

529
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,310
If so, this should be handled by every Legions.

530
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,790
Of course. I have contacted the other Kings.

531
00:49:41,390 --> 00:49:44,690
However, due to network instability,

532
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,650
I still get no response from them.

533
00:49:48,630 --> 00:49:50,390
There's also another serious problem.

534
00:49:51,010 --> 00:49:53,730
If we analyze the spread of this black cloud,

535
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,550
it will spread nationwide at 6:00 tomorrow

536
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,770
and we can't access the accelerated world anymore.

537
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:05,030
That fast?

538
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:09,330
We should stand by and wait for the Kings' answers until then.

539
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:12,970
But, if I still can't get hold of them...

540
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:17,810
We, the Nega Nebolous, have to get rid of the black cloud ourselves.

541
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:19,350
That's right.

542
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:24,970
Actually, I planned to gather all Legion members tonight

543
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:27,070
and discuss about this mission.

544
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:29,810
Do you have a place in mind?

545
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:37,590
Actually, my parents are on overseas trip, so...

546
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:41,330
Thank you. I was thinking to ask you myself.

547
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:45,430
So we're meeting up at Haru's later, right?

548
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:47,810
I will let everyone know as well.

549
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,210
Oh yeah, isn't today...

550
00:51:19,290 --> 00:51:21,930
Even though it's just an Augmented Reality.

551
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:24,690
You're no fun, professor.

552
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,670
Beautiful.

553
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:28,610
Yeah.

554
00:51:29,210 --> 00:51:35,050
I was thinking if it's alright to go have fun while the accelerated world is in danger.

555
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,070
But I'm glad.

556
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:38,710
Everyone seems enjoying it.

557
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:47,230
Haruyuki-kun. Have you thought what will happen to you if Burst Linker disappeared?

558
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:51,390
Yes, but I can't really make out of it.

559
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:53,830
Even imagining it scared me.

560
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,430
That's right. I'm also scared.

561
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:04,390
If all our points depleted, our memories of Burst Linker will be gone.

562
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:09,310
On one side, it gives me a relief.

563
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:14,990
But, if every social camera in Tokyo become like this,

564
00:52:15,490 --> 00:52:19,210
the truth about Burst Linker will be gone as well,

565
00:52:19,650 --> 00:52:22,410
leaving our memories in vague feelings.

566
00:52:23,130 --> 00:52:26,730
Of course, I don't want it to end like that.

567
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:30,270
I'm glad everyone's here together today.

568
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:34,430
It's alright to play a little before an important mission.

569
00:52:35,170 --> 00:52:37,650
Fuuko and Nico especially,

570
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,750
but I'm sure everyone keeps their mouth to not ruin the mood.

571
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:45,750
If we don't have a strong bond, we wouldn't understand each other like that.

572
00:52:50,130 --> 00:52:51,330
It's okay.

573
00:52:56,370 --> 00:53:00,990
We won't stay silent when the accelerated world is in danger.

574
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:02,790
I'm sure of it.

575
00:53:03,370 --> 00:53:05,110
You said it too, right, Senpai?

576
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,510
We can be stronger if we work together.

577
00:53:09,890 --> 00:53:15,010
Even if we can't accelerate anymore, we will still be Burst Linker.

578
00:53:15,470 --> 00:53:20,650
Our bonds will not weaken even a little bit.

579
00:53:20,650 --> 00:53:21,850
I promise!

580
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:25,090
I was lonely until I met you.

581
00:53:25,090 --> 00:53:26,250
I thought it was fine for me.

582
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:26,490
Haruyuki-kun.
I thought it was fine for me.

583
00:53:26,490 --> 00:53:26,990
Haruyuki-kun.

584
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:27,140
I don't care about reality and just indulged myself in virtual world.
Haruyuki-kun.

585
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:30,270
I don't care about reality and just indulged myself in virtual world.

586
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:31,850
But to a miserable person like me-

587
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:32,210
Haruyuki-kun!
But to a miserable person like me-

588
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:32,910
Haruyuki-kun!

589
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:34,350
Yes?

590
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:54,110
I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it!

591
00:53:54,110 --> 00:53:57,350
Sorry! Sorry! Forgive me!

592
00:54:00,130 --> 00:54:02,170
Haruyuki-kun, I...

593
00:54:04,890 --> 00:54:05,790
Yes?

594
00:54:06,450 --> 00:54:09,090
Am I not good enough for you?

595
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,670
What are you talking about?

596
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,970
Please forgive me.

597
00:54:15,970 --> 00:54:17,190
No need to apologize!

598
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,670
In the end, the Kings still didn't give any response.

599
00:54:27,370 --> 00:54:32,870
This means that only Nega Nebulous and Prominence will take part in this mission.

600
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,150
But this won't be the last.

601
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:39,310
We still need to investigate the black cloud's origin

602
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,670
and prepare for any fight to come.

603
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,270
Whatever enemy awaits us,

604
00:54:44,270 --> 00:54:47,330
we will complete the mission and return back safely.

605
00:54:48,810 --> 00:54:50,690
Unlimited Burst!

606
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:55,350
Unlimited Neutral Field

607
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,290
Border of Suginami Area No. 3
Purgatory Stage

608
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:06,390
There's no mistaking it. It looks the same as before.

609
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:12,090
Then, if we're devoured by that, we're a goner, right?

610
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:13,810
So huge.

611
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,010
You bastard!

612
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:19,430
What are you doing suddenly?

613
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:23,690
Even though you know your sister's feeling, you were flirting with Lotus-sensei instead.

614
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,950
You damn perverted crow!

615
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,370
You got it wrong, Onii-san!

616
00:55:28,370 --> 00:55:30,130
You guys, stop it!

617
00:55:30,130 --> 00:55:32,170
Stop fooling around!

618
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:38,530
Let's start our plan.

619
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:40,570
Come out, Invicible!

620
00:56:07,710 --> 00:56:10,390
Heatblast Saturation!

621
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:19,630
Looks like our information was right.

622
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:23,750
But, looking at the reaction, looks like I can't do any damage.

623
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,850
My machine is actually easy-come-easy-go, you know!

624
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:30,030
I think it has negative meaning.

625
00:56:31,510 --> 00:56:33,450
Looks like our plan is flawed.

626
00:56:33,870 --> 00:56:36,390
We can't just go attack randomly.

627
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,290
But we have to do it anyway.

628
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:41,870
Who is it?

629
00:56:45,390 --> 00:56:47,510
The Green King, Green Grande!

630
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,570
He comes!

631
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:53,710
Boss.

632
00:56:54,270 --> 00:56:56,650
That cloud is sentient.

633
00:56:57,490 --> 00:56:59,690
He talked!

634
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:01,690
Do you mean it, Grande?

635
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:06,250
That is the Dark Cloud, a skill possessed by Goddess of Nyx,

636
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:07,490
You said Nyx?

637
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:09,470
But she was already sealed.

638
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:14,470
There must be a Burst Linker power which woke Nyx up.

639
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:15,910
Nyx?

640
00:57:15,910 --> 00:57:17,070
Sealed?

641
00:57:17,590 --> 00:57:22,550
Now that you know the situation, we need to find the source of her awakening.

642
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:26,970
So you think you can do something to that Dark Whatever?

643
00:57:28,830 --> 00:57:30,390
Parsec Wall.

644
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:36,550
An ultimate move?

645
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,630
That's freaking great, boss!

646
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:51,410
Looks like the old man still has the guts.

647
00:57:51,410 --> 00:57:54,610
Well, seems like I have no other choice than believe in you.

648
00:57:55,140 --> 00:57:57,190
Change! Dreadnought!

649
00:58:30,870 --> 00:58:31,870
Get aboard!

650
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:38,250
Let's go! Make sure you don't fall off!

651
00:58:48,370 --> 00:58:52,270
Thank you for choosing to ride with us.

652
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:58,590
Along the way, I need to fill my special move gauge, so please expect a rough trip.

653
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:02,950
Even if there's lot of shaking, please make sure don't fall off, okay?

654
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:09,710
As a reminder, this is a trip to save ourselves as well as the accelerated world.

655
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:14,630
With Scarlet Rain's pro driving, we will arrive in no time!

656
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,120
It's about time.

657
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:24,470
We have no choice other than break through the Dark Cloud.

658
00:59:24,470 --> 00:59:26,230
So it's your turn, Grande.

659
00:59:37,990 --> 00:59:39,430
Parsec Wall.

660
00:59:45,510 --> 00:59:47,730
Are you okay, Grande-san?

661
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,630
Two minutes left.

662
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,710
What?

663
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,510
That skill has time limit?

664
00:59:57,170 --> 01:00:00,490
You should say it earlier, Grande-san.

665
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,470
I'm speeding up!

666
01:00:05,530 --> 01:00:07,490
Rain! Watch out!

667
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,940
Looks like the shield will disappear soon.

668
01:00:16,470 --> 01:00:20,670
10, 9, 8, 7, ...

669
01:00:21,110 --> 01:00:22,310
Countdown?

670
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:23,610
Hurry up, Rain!

671
01:00:23,610 --> 01:00:25,490
I'm trying!

672
01:00:25,490 --> 01:00:29,450
4, 3, 2, 1, ...

673
01:00:43,830 --> 01:00:44,570
Look!

674
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:47,570
What's that?

675
01:01:04,340 --> 01:01:07,310
Is that Olympic Stadium?

676
01:01:07,870 --> 01:01:08,870
I will go investigate!

677
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:49,950
That's...

678
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:52,150
Nyx's monster corps,

679
01:01:52,150 --> 01:01:53,550
Nukes Core

680
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:56,070
and seems like that thing is spawning these monsters.

681
01:01:56,590 --> 01:01:58,450
They are protection the Stadium.

682
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:04,490
So it's true that Nyx the Goddess of Night broke out of the seal and now inside of that thing.

683
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,710
Get ready, everyone! Battle formation!

684
01:02:07,710 --> 01:02:11,090
Rain, set up your machine! Attack them with long range attack!

685
01:02:11,090 --> 01:02:11,790
Let's go!

686
01:02:23,710 --> 01:02:24,810
There's too many of them.

687
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:30,090
Leave it to me!

688
01:02:33,170 --> 01:02:35,030
Take this!

689
01:02:35,030 --> 01:02:37,070
Heatblast Saturation!

690
01:02:38,690 --> 01:02:39,950
They blocked it?

691
01:02:40,710 --> 01:02:41,570
What?

692
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:44,530
You disgusting creature!

693
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:51,410
Senpai, who is this Goddess Nyx?

694
01:02:51,410 --> 01:02:54,090
She was the boss from a certain dungeon.

695
01:02:54,090 --> 01:03:00,110
But she was considered too dangerous so she was sealed inside the dungeon.

696
01:03:00,530 --> 01:03:02,050
Too dangerous?

697
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:05,090
She was not entitled "the legendary enemy" for nothing.

698
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,570
She has the power to take all the power she desires.

699
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:13,650
So how come that Nyx is here right now?

700
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:15,570
Flame Torrent!

701
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:17,870
Sis, it's your turn!

702
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,050
Maelstrom.

703
01:03:23,510 --> 01:03:26,850
Phase Trans: Keen!

704
01:03:49,110 --> 01:03:50,570
Flame Torrent!

705
01:03:51,950 --> 01:03:53,590
There's no end to them.

706
01:03:54,850 --> 01:03:56,350
We can only hold them back.

707
01:03:56,770 --> 01:03:57,850
This looks bad.

708
01:03:57,850 --> 01:03:59,950
Damn, I'm surrounded!

709
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:01,030
Rain!

710
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:08,750
I can't use the missile!

711
01:04:12,010 --> 01:04:13,970
If she's defeated here...

712
01:04:14,970 --> 01:04:16,750
She can't return to the Neutral Field.

713
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:19,790
Damn! You bastard!

714
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:23,270
Rain!

715
01:04:32,550 --> 01:04:33,650
That skill...

716
01:04:45,830 --> 01:04:51,270
Aster Vine, and the Purple King, Purple Thorn.

717
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:52,750
Why?

718
01:04:52,750 --> 01:04:55,230
We don't come to help you, Lotus.

719
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,750
Grande asked us to, so we agreed to it.

720
01:04:59,490 --> 01:05:02,930
Good grief. I don't know if you want to kill me or rescue me.

721
01:05:03,890 --> 01:05:05,650
Then I won't save you next time.

722
01:05:06,330 --> 01:05:07,610
Here they come again!

723
01:05:07,610 --> 01:05:08,570
Chi-chan, get down!

724
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:21,530
Still doing whatever you wish, aren't you?

725
01:05:22,990 --> 01:05:24,490
The Blue King, Blue Knight.

726
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:27,230
How did you get in here?

727
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,890
Be thankful to Grande.

728
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:35,010
We wouldn't get this far if that guy didn't open the way for us.

729
01:05:35,550 --> 01:05:39,290
Oh, so that's why you look that messed up.

730
01:05:39,290 --> 01:05:40,110
What?

731
01:05:41,050 --> 01:05:44,530
It's okay. We're in better situation than you are right now.

732
01:05:44,530 --> 01:05:47,290
Besides, the savior always comes late, right?

733
01:05:47,690 --> 01:05:48,930
Right, Lotus?

734
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:54,930
I know we're not in good terms, but it's alright to work together in times like this, don't you think?

735
01:05:54,930 --> 01:05:58,130
What? How dare you talk big like that?

736
01:05:58,130 --> 01:06:00,950
Now, now. It's alright, Senpai.

737
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,550
Bell, please heal the Kings!

738
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:12,050
Excuse me, can you gather around?

739
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:15,230
Please come closer! Yes, like that!

740
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:16,710
Here I go!

741
01:06:17,190 --> 01:06:18,310
Citron...

742
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,670
Call!

743
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,450
So this is the rumored healing skill.

744
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,850
To think we can feel it first hand.

745
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:35,530
Man, it does feel good!

746
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:40,770
Okay it's done, good work!

747
01:06:42,610 --> 01:06:46,010
Lotus, it's not good to advance recklessly.

748
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,210
Got it.

749
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,510
Seems like those small nodes are spawning their minions.

750
01:06:51,070 --> 01:06:54,510
Focus your ultimate skills take them down one by one.

751
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:55,590
What do you think?

752
01:06:55,590 --> 01:06:56,410
Sounds good.

753
01:06:56,890 --> 01:06:57,990
Nega Nebulous!

754
01:07:03,390 --> 01:07:07,210
Here I come! Coronal Mass Ejection!

755
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:10,230
Vorpal Strike!

756
01:07:10,870 --> 01:07:12,750
Lightning Cyan Spike!

757
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:14,830
Superluminal Stroke!

758
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,070
Frontal Thunder!

759
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,330
Maelstrom.

760
01:07:17,330 --> 01:07:18,290
Laser...

761
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:20,930
Javelin!

762
01:07:36,210 --> 01:07:37,110
Don't let down!

763
01:07:37,110 --> 01:07:38,930
There's two more.

764
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:40,150
Yeah!

765
01:08:04,570 --> 01:08:05,470
Chi-chan!

766
01:08:13,190 --> 01:08:14,070
Taku!

767
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:20,330
Taku!

768
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:28,610
This is bad.

769
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,650
If this keeps up, everyone will fall apart.

770
01:08:41,430 --> 01:08:42,550
This is...

771
01:08:49,270 --> 01:08:50,750
Could it be...

772
01:08:57,240 --> 01:08:59,830
Really, I can't stand seeing it anymore.

773
01:08:59,830 --> 01:09:01,930
Can't stand anymore!

774
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:03,170
Yellow Radio!

775
01:09:03,170 --> 01:09:05,670
I'm completely have nothing to do with this.

776
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,330
But it's okay to give a little hand, isn't it?

777
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:11,690
It's okay, isn't it?

778
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,930
You just followed us here, didn't you?

779
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:17,250
You have no right to talk big like that!

780
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:19,110
Now, what are talking about?

781
01:09:19,110 --> 01:09:20,340
What talk? What talk?

782
01:09:41,730 --> 01:09:45,030
The Six Kings assembled together looks awesome.

783
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:49,290
Yeah, I would've never thought to see such sight.

784
01:09:49,290 --> 01:09:50,350
Silver Crow.

785
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:51,930
Yes!

786
01:09:53,130 --> 01:09:55,150
We will take care of the enemies.

787
01:09:55,570 --> 01:09:57,750
Just fly to your heart's content.

788
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:01,090
Got it!

789
01:10:01,570 --> 01:10:03,650
We will open the path for you.

790
01:10:04,010 --> 01:10:05,290
Right, everyone?

791
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:09,630
It's time to move. Let's go!

792
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:15,850
Set on!

793
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,190
Gale Thruster!

794
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:49,810
I'll destroy you to pieces!

795
01:10:49,810 --> 01:10:51,710
Hailstorm Domination!

796
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,270
Flame Torrent!

797
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,270
Maiden!

798
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:02,130
Yes!

799
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,990
Flame Vortex!

800
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,990
Go for it, Crow. Blow that damned thing!

801
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:31,210
Senpai, this place...

802
01:11:31,210 --> 01:11:33,750
Yes, it feels like the gravity's off.

803
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:35,110
Over there!

804
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:58,150
You are...

805
01:11:59,870 --> 01:12:00,850
The girl from before.

806
01:12:01,310 --> 01:12:03,410
You should not wake us up.

807
01:12:03,410 --> 01:12:05,950
Were you the one who made that black cloud?

808
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:12,640
The cloud will put the accelerated world into eternal slumber.

809
01:12:13,350 --> 01:12:18,050
So there will be no one fighting, crying, and hurting anymore.

810
01:12:18,810 --> 01:12:25,110
All Burst Linker will be able to fall into gentle sleep forever with no worries.

811
01:12:25,110 --> 01:12:27,710
I won't accept that way of life!

812
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,910
Burst Linker has no meaning of we can't accelerate.

813
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:34,140
Then you can spend your eternity here.

814
01:12:34,830 --> 01:12:38,970
In this flower garden, you can accelerate without end.

815
01:12:44,190 --> 01:12:45,310
What is this?

816
01:12:47,350 --> 01:12:50,050
Something is flowing inside. This is...

817
01:12:53,850 --> 01:12:56,230
her memories?

818
01:13:05,110 --> 01:13:07,270
Unlimited Burst!

819
01:13:09,050 --> 01:13:17,330
Your small yet sorrowful cries awaken me from my long sleep.

820
01:13:19,030 --> 01:13:21,370
Why are you crying?

821
01:13:21,370 --> 01:13:23,840
I have failed.

822
01:13:25,010 --> 01:13:26,880
I'm sure in the real world, I...

823
01:13:35,690 --> 01:13:39,040
Now, I'm afraid to even think about jumping.

824
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,640
Even though I've struggled so much in the accelerated world.

825
01:13:45,270 --> 01:13:47,590
Even though everyone has acknowledged me.

826
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:52,940
I'm just worth nothing without my gymnastics.

827
01:14:16,850 --> 01:14:17,740
Welcome.

828
01:14:23,970 --> 01:14:27,850
Foolish! So you have been in the Unlimited Field the whole time since then?

829
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:31,400
Yes. She can't even return to the Lowest Level.

830
01:14:31,850 --> 01:14:34,350
She will continue her eternal slumber here.

831
01:14:34,350 --> 01:14:35,890
That is my only wish.
That is her only wish.

832
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:37,910
Laser Sword!

833
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:43,130
You can't do that! We are not enemies! We are not meant to live in this world!

834
01:14:43,130 --> 01:14:48,110
If you keep interrupting her, I will devour you in the dark.

835
01:14:56,510 --> 01:14:57,070
Senpai!

836
01:15:15,950 --> 01:15:16,850
This is...

837
01:15:17,770 --> 01:15:20,150
So this is Nyx's true form?

838
01:15:21,530 --> 01:15:24,110
Wait, if we're too far, we will be caught.

839
01:15:24,110 --> 01:15:24,990
Well, then...

840
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,150
Senpai, they are...

841
01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,610
I've heard about it.

842
01:15:35,610 --> 01:15:38,930
Nemesis and Thanatos, Nyx's strongest guards.

843
01:15:42,250 --> 01:15:44,390
Their damage is no joke.

844
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,190
Senpai!

845
01:16:01,510 --> 01:16:03,070
What are you doing?

846
01:16:03,550 --> 01:16:04,550
Metatron?

847
01:16:04,930 --> 01:16:05,730
We're saved.

848
01:16:06,140 --> 01:16:08,050
Shut up, you black cloth!

849
01:16:08,050 --> 01:16:12,710
Seriously, I can't stand seeing you act like an idiot!

850
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:15,210
Hear me, Silver Crow!

851
01:16:15,590 --> 01:16:22,050
The way you are now, you have no ability to do anything. You useless brat!

852
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:24,110
I'm sorry.

853
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,310
However...

854
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:29,480
Nyx are being connected to the white girl through a certain circuit.

855
01:16:30,090 --> 01:16:33,430
Their bonds are even stronger than ours.

856
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:38,170
We can break them apart if we get her free.

857
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,670
But I don't have such power.

858
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:43,990
Get a grip!

859
01:16:44,570 --> 01:16:46,430
Not with power, but your heart!

860
01:16:46,430 --> 01:16:49,430
If you believe you can do it, you will succeed!

861
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:59,530
First we need to wake her up, then defeat Nyx!

862
01:16:59,950 --> 01:17:02,990
Now, Silver Crow. Spread your wings to victory!

863
01:17:03,610 --> 01:17:04,370
Yeah!

864
01:17:04,370 --> 01:17:06,670
Senpai, please lend me your strength!

865
01:17:06,670 --> 01:17:08,190
Yeah. Here it comes!

866
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,550
Light Speed!

867
01:17:21,390 --> 01:17:24,450
Ultimate skill! Metatron Wings!

868
01:17:45,430 --> 01:17:47,270
Laser Lance!

869
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:48,750
Vorpal Strike!

870
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:09,710
Why did you wake me up?

871
01:18:10,330 --> 01:18:13,170
We must accept our reality some day.

872
01:18:13,530 --> 01:18:17,570
On the other side, there are always people who are dear to us.

873
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:21,830
I have been alone all the time.

874
01:18:22,370 --> 01:18:25,610
I don't have anyone like that in the real world.

875
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,070
All I have is just gymnastics.

876
01:18:28,440 --> 01:18:31,440
That's why, I'm still connected to everyone else.

877
01:18:32,270 --> 01:18:35,950
Even if I cried, I'm the only one feeling sorrow.

878
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:38,590
I'm fine just sleeping in this world forever.

879
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,770
When I win, I also think the same.

880
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:46,440
I've thought if everything will be gone or if I can't stand up anymore.

881
01:18:47,090 --> 01:18:51,250
But Haruyuki-kun and his friends taught me something.

882
01:18:55,150 --> 01:19:00,530
If we stretch our arm, we can reach to any place we want however far they are.

883
01:19:02,930 --> 01:19:06,810
I'm sure those important to you are still waiting for you.

884
01:19:23,210 --> 01:19:23,930
Look!

885
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:30,730
You're going home?

886
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:34,790
I'm sorry and thank you, Nyx.

887
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:36,870
But, I'm sure you will be fine.

888
01:19:37,830 --> 01:19:41,350
Because I'm always watching over you.

889
01:19:42,370 --> 01:19:43,230
Always...

890
01:20:03,350 --> 01:20:07,430
Is it fine to come in groups like this?

891
01:20:07,430 --> 01:20:10,010
What? It's normal to visit the hospital.

892
01:20:10,550 --> 01:20:14,050
Many people come here, and we don't mean anything bad.

893
01:20:14,790 --> 01:20:17,470
I was experienced in this, after all.

894
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,930
What were you bragging that for?

895
01:20:22,970 --> 01:20:24,490
Could it be her?

896
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:29,470
Huh? They're not from our school, right?

897
01:20:29,870 --> 01:20:30,970
Do you know them, Risa?

898
01:20:36,050 --> 01:20:37,910
Well, they might be my friends.

899
01:20:38,305 --> 01:21:38,281
Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
