2
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:20,046
Surprise!

3
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,595
Alex. Do not interrupt me
when I'm daydreaming.

4
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:29,931
When a zebra's in the zone,
leave him alone.

5
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:32,892
Come on, Marty. Just wanted
to wish you a happy birthday.

6
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:35,103
Hey, man, thanks.

7
00:01:36,813 --> 00:01:40,066
Hey, I got something
stuck in my teeth.

8
00:01:40,149 --> 00:01:42,944
It's driving me crazy.
Can you help me out here? Please?

9
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:45,321
You came to the right place, my friend.

10
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:48,449
Dr. Marty, D.D.S., is in the house.

11
00:01:48,533 --> 00:01:53,579
Please hop on top of my sterilized
examination table, if you may.

12
00:01:55,206 --> 00:01:57,834
- I don't see anything.
- It's on the left.

13
00:01:57,917 --> 00:01:59,127
Oh, sorry.

14
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,796
Okay, just don't talk
with your mouth full.

15
00:02:02,964 --> 00:02:06,384
Right here. What the heck
is this doing in there?

16
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,885
Happy birthday!

17
00:02:07,969 --> 00:02:10,346
Aw, hey, thanks, man.

18
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,558
You put it in behind the tooth.
You all right.

19
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:16,561
These aren't even on the shelf yet.
Here. Check it out. Check it out.

20
00:02:16,561 --> 00:02:21,399
- Look at that. Ooh! Look at that.
- Look at that. It's snowing.

21
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:23,943
Ten years old, huh? A decade.

22
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:26,321
Double digits. The big 1-0.

23
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,158
You don't like it?

24
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:32,493
- No, no, it's great.
- You hate it.

25
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:36,331
I should've gotten you the Alex
alarm clock. That's the big seller.

26
00:02:36,372 --> 00:02:39,334
No, no, no.
The present's great, really.

27
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:42,086
It's just that
another year's come and gone

28
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,213
and I'm still doing
the same old thing.

29
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:49,135
"Stand over here. Trot over there.
Eat some grass. Walk back over here."

30
00:02:49,218 --> 00:02:51,971
- I see your problem.
- Maybe I should go to law school.

31
00:02:52,055 --> 00:02:54,724
You just need to break out
of that boring routine.

32
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,726
- How?
- Throw out the old act.

33
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,353
Get out there.
Who knows what you're gonna do.

34
00:02:58,353 --> 00:02:59,812
Make it up as you go along.

35
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:02,815
Ad lib. Improvise. On the fly.
Boom, boom, boom.

36
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:05,151
- Really?
- You know, make it fresh.

37
00:03:05,234 --> 00:03:07,612
Fresh, huh? Okay.
I could do fresh.

38
00:03:07,695 --> 00:03:08,738
Works for me.

39
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,037
Here come the people, Marty.
I love the people.

40
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,830
It's fun people fun time!

41
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:21,709
Let's go, Gloria!
Up and at 'em. We're open!

42
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,753
What day is it?

43
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:26,255
It's Friday. Field trip day.

44
00:03:26,297 --> 00:03:29,550
Yes, it's field trip day.
Let's get up and go...

45
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,386
...in ten more minutes.

46
00:03:33,262 --> 00:03:34,347
Come on!

47
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,308
Melman, Melman, Melman!
Melman, Melman, Melman!

48
00:03:37,392 --> 00:03:41,646
Wake up! Rise and shine! It's another
fabulous morning in the Big Apple.

49
00:03:41,729 --> 00:03:43,064
Let's go.

50
00:03:43,106 --> 00:03:46,109
- Not for me. I'm calling in sick.
- What?

51
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:50,196
I found another brown spot
on my shoulder. Right here. See?

52
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,281
Right there. You see?

53
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,493
Melman, you know
it's all in your head. Hm?

54
00:03:55,576 --> 00:03:57,412
Let's go! Come on!

55
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,261
Phil! Wake up, you filthy monkey.

56
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:18,808
Oh, I'm going to be fresh.

57
00:04:18,891 --> 00:04:22,687
Straight out the ground.
Tasty fresh! Freshalicious.

58
00:04:24,814 --> 00:04:26,024
Ziploc fresh.

59
00:04:26,107 --> 00:04:28,776
Ladies and gentlemen,
children of all ages,

60
00:04:28,818 --> 00:04:31,154
the Central Park Zoo
proudly presents:

61
00:04:31,237 --> 00:04:33,072
Show them the cat. Who's the cat?

62
00:04:33,156 --> 00:04:35,450
The king of New York City.

63
00:04:35,491 --> 00:04:38,036
Alex the lion.

64
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:40,288
It's showtime.

65
00:04:44,917 --> 00:04:46,919
Roar!

66
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,683
Gather around, people.
Big show about to start.

67
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:04,479
Check out the zebra
taking care of biz. That's right.

68
00:05:38,304 --> 00:05:40,515
Just smile and wave, boys.

69
00:05:40,556 --> 00:05:42,433
Smile and wave.

70
00:05:42,517 --> 00:05:44,686
Kowalski, progress report.

71
00:05:45,228 --> 00:05:47,438
We're only 500 feet from
the main sewer line.

72
00:05:47,522 --> 00:05:50,525
- And the bad news?
- We've broken our last shovel.

73
00:05:50,566 --> 00:05:51,901
Right.

74
00:05:52,527 --> 00:05:55,530
Rico, you're on litter patrol.
We need shovels.

75
00:05:55,738 --> 00:06:00,118
And find more Popsicle sticks.
We don't want to risk another cave-in.

76
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,452
And me, skipper?

77
00:06:01,536 --> 00:06:04,580
I want you to look
cute and cuddly, private.

78
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:07,041
Today we're going to blow this dump.

79
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:09,752
Come here. Come here.
Come on, penguin.

80
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,676
Yeah! You don't
see that on Animal Planet.

81
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,469
Ha-ha.

82
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:22,473
Well, show's over, folks.
Thanks for coming.

83
00:06:22,557 --> 00:06:24,892
I hope you thought it was fresh.

84
00:06:24,934 --> 00:06:26,477
I'll be here all week.

85
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:29,147
In fact, I'll be here
for my whole life.

86
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,566
Three hundred
and sixty-five days a year,

87
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,611
including Christmas,
Hanukkah, Halloween, Kwanzaa.

88
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,240
Please don't forget
to never spay or neuter your pets.

89
00:06:39,949 --> 00:06:43,244
And tip your cabbie,
because he's broke.

90
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:53,087
You, quadruped.
Sprechen sie Englisch?

91
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,756
I sprechen.

92
00:06:54,797 --> 00:06:57,967
- What continent is this?
- Manhattan.

93
00:06:58,051 --> 00:07:00,970
Hoover Dam! We're still in New York.

94
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,264
Abort. Dive! Dive! Dive.

95
00:07:03,348 --> 00:07:05,600
Hey. You in the tux. Wait a minute.

96
00:07:06,184 --> 00:07:08,144
What are you guys doing?

97
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:10,021
We're digging to Antarctica.

98
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,273
Ant-who-tica?

99
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,943
Can you keep a secret,
my monochromatic friend?

100
00:07:19,113 --> 00:07:23,284
Do you ever see any penguins
running free around New York City?

101
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:28,456
Of course not. We don't belong here.
It's just not natural.

102
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:31,834
This is all some kind
of whacked-out conspiracy.

103
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:35,922
We're going to the
wide-open spaces of Antarctica.

104
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:37,423
To the wild.

105
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:42,887
The wild?
You could actually go there?

106
00:07:42,971 --> 00:07:44,305
That sounds great.

107
00:07:46,099 --> 00:07:50,061
Hey, hold up. Where is this place?
Tell me where it is.

108
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:53,690
You didn't see anything.

109
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:54,816
Right?

110
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:56,567
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:58,319
I'm sorry. No, sir.

112
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:02,865
For his final appearance of the day,

113
00:08:03,032 --> 00:08:06,035
the king of New York City.

114
00:08:06,202 --> 00:08:07,787
Alex the lion.

115
00:08:07,996 --> 00:08:09,664
Roar!

116
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,378
Thank you. Thank you very much.

117
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:19,090
You guys are great. You're a
great crowd. Give yourselves a hand.

118
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:21,467
Thank you. Oh. Thank you.

119
00:08:21,551 --> 00:08:23,261
Oh! Well. Thank you.

120
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,680
Oh, that's too kind. Too kind.

121
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:29,475
Underpants!

122
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:32,687
Everybody get home safe. Hey!
Check out my Web site.

123
00:08:32,812 --> 00:08:35,356
Twenty-four hour Alex Cam.
Watch me sleep.

124
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:45,700
This is the life.

125
00:08:46,159 --> 00:08:47,869
That's the spot.

126
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:49,787
Oh! I'm in heaven.

127
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:02,383
- Ooh, it's Marty's birthday.
- Just rip it open.

128
00:09:02,425 --> 00:09:05,595
- What is it?
- Come on. Open it up. What you got?

129
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:06,971
A thermometer.

130
00:09:07,055 --> 00:09:10,933
Thanks. I love it, Melman. I love it.

131
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:13,936
Yeah, I wanted to give you
something personal.

132
00:09:13,978 --> 00:09:16,481
You know, that was my first
rectal thermometer.

133
00:09:16,564 --> 00:09:18,650
- Mother...
- I'll miss that bad boy.

134
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:20,401
Get the cake. Melman, come on.

135
00:09:24,113 --> 00:09:25,990
Happy birthday to you

136
00:09:26,074 --> 00:09:27,992
You live in a zoo

137
00:09:28,076 --> 00:09:30,411
You look like a monkey

138
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:33,289
And you smell like one too

139
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:36,501
I say.

140
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:41,130
Aw, well, now, you guys
are just embarrassing me.

141
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,507
And yourselves.

142
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,968
What are you talking about?
We worked on that all week.

143
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,845
Let's go.
Let's make a wish, babycakes.

144
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:56,437
- Come on. What'd you wish for?
- Nope. Can't tell you that.

145
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,647
Come on. Tell.

146
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,066
No siree.
I'm telling you, it's bad luck.

147
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,485
You want some bad luck,
I'll blab it out.

148
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,071
But if you want to be safe,
I'll keep my mouth shut.

149
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:08,032
Would you just tell us?
I mean, really. What could happen?

150
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:09,367
Okay.

151
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,746
I wished I could go to the wild!

152
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,039
The wild?!

153
00:10:18,835 --> 00:10:20,461
I told you it was bad luck.

154
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,173
The wild? Are you nuts?

155
00:10:24,215 --> 00:10:27,302
That is the worst idea
I've ever heard.

156
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,139
It's unsanitary.

157
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,309
The penguins are going.
So why can't I?

158
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:35,893
The penguins are psychotic.

159
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:39,355
Come on. Just imagine
going back to nature.

160
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:43,443
Back to your roots.
Clean air, wide-open spaces!

161
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:46,195
Well, I hear they have
wide-open spaces in Connecticut.

162
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:47,113
Connecticut?

163
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,490
Yeah. What you gotta do is
you go over to Grand Central.

164
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:52,744
And then you gotta take
the Metro-North train... north?

165
00:10:52,827 --> 00:10:57,040
So one could take the train?
Just hypothetically.

166
00:10:57,123 --> 00:11:00,043
Marty come on. What would
Connecticut have to offer us?

167
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:02,003
- Lyme disease.
- Thank you, Melman.

168
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:03,296
No, no really, really.
I just want...

169
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:05,298
There's certainly none of
this in the wild.

170
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:08,760
This is a highly
refined type of food thing

171
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:10,678
that you do not find in the wild.

172
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,973
You ever thought there might
be more to life than steak, Alex?

173
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:16,893
He didn't mean that, baby.
No, no, no.

174
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,647
Doesn't it bother you guys
that you don't know anything

175
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:23,107
about life outside this zoo?

176
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,235
- Nuh-uh. Nope.
- Mm-mm.

177
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:29,947
Well, I mean, come on.
That's just one subject.

178
00:11:30,615 --> 00:11:33,743
You got a little schmutz
right there on your...

179
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:42,752
Thanks, guys.
Thanks for the party. It was great.

180
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,045
Really.

181
00:11:51,886 --> 00:11:53,054
What's eating him?

182
00:11:53,096 --> 00:11:54,764
Maybe you should
talk to him Alex.

183
00:11:54,806 --> 00:11:57,058
You know, go over there
and give him a little pep talk.

184
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,979
Hey, I already gave him
a snow globe. I can't top that.

185
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,232
- Alex.
- I can see where this is going.

186
00:12:05,108 --> 00:12:07,944
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

187
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,498
Come on. He's your best friend.

188
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:23,584
All right, all right. Okay.

189
00:12:23,626 --> 00:12:26,254
- Night, Marty.
- Night, Glo.

190
00:12:49,193 --> 00:12:50,903
What a day.

191
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:51,904
I mean, just really...

192
00:12:51,988 --> 00:12:52,947
Really I mean I tell you,

193
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:55,908
it just doesn't get any better
than this, you know?

194
00:12:56,951 --> 00:13:00,079
Ooh! It just did.
Even the star's out.

195
00:13:01,289 --> 00:13:04,125
Not going to find a star
like that in the wild.

196
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:05,209
Helicopter.

197
00:13:09,172 --> 00:13:10,840
Marty. Buddy. Listen.

198
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,008
Everybody has days

199
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:14,552
when they think the grass might
be greener somewhere else.

200
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,220
Alex.

201
00:13:17,305 --> 00:13:18,556
Look at me.

202
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,643
I'm ten years old.
My life is half over.

203
00:13:21,684 --> 00:13:24,354
And I don't even know
if I'm black with white stripes...

204
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,649
...or white with black stripes.

205
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:34,530
Marty.

206
00:13:35,114 --> 00:13:37,950
I'm thinking of a song.

207
00:13:38,034 --> 00:13:39,869
Alex. Please. Not now.

208
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:43,831
Oh, yes. It's a wonderful song.
I think you're familiar with it.

209
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,044
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
No, no, no.

210
00:13:48,127 --> 00:13:49,671
I'm not listening.

211
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:53,299
Start spreadin' the news

212
00:13:53,383 --> 00:13:54,467
I don't know you.

213
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,220
I'm leaving today

214
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:02,016
- We are a great big part of it
- He's funny. Who is that?

215
00:14:02,934 --> 00:14:05,561
Come on. You know
you know the words.

216
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,730
Two little words.

217
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:09,023
New York.

218
00:14:09,065 --> 00:14:10,692
New York

219
00:14:10,775 --> 00:14:13,903
Shut up, shut up, shut up!
Hey, I'm sleeping here!

220
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,822
We're not all nocturnal,
you know!

221
00:14:15,905 --> 00:14:18,449
I'll knock your "turnal"
right off, pal.

222
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:20,743
Yeah, you and what army, stripes?

223
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:23,705
You mess with him,
you mess with me, Howard.

224
00:14:23,788 --> 00:14:27,417
- You're a bigmouth lion.
- See? Mr. Grumpy Stripes.

225
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,794
We make a great team,
the two of us.

226
00:14:29,877 --> 00:14:32,547
We sure do.
No doubt about it.

227
00:14:32,588 --> 00:14:33,589
So, what are you going to do?

228
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,092
Just go running off to
the wild by yourself?

229
00:14:36,259 --> 00:14:37,302
- No.
- Good.

230
00:14:37,385 --> 00:14:39,012
You and me. Let's go.

231
00:14:39,095 --> 00:14:40,221
- What?
- The wild.

232
00:14:40,263 --> 00:14:42,598
Come on. You and me together.

233
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,102
It's a straight shot down
Fifth Avenue to Grand Central.

234
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:48,146
We'll grab a train,
we'll head north.

235
00:14:48,229 --> 00:14:50,898
We can be back by morning.
No one will ever know.

236
00:14:50,982 --> 00:14:53,192
You're joking. Right?

237
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,783
Yeah. I'm joking. Of course
I'm joking. Give me a break.

238
00:15:00,825 --> 00:15:02,493
Like we're going to get a train.

239
00:15:04,078 --> 00:15:06,789
Don't do that. You really
had me worried there.

240
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:10,835
Oh, well.
I guess I'll hit the sack.

241
00:15:10,918 --> 00:15:14,464
Yeah, me too. I'll need
to rest my voice for tomorrow.

242
00:15:14,964 --> 00:15:18,217
It's Seniors' Day, you know.
Have to roar extra loud.

243
00:15:18,301 --> 00:15:21,137
Give them a little jolt.
You know what I'm talking about?

244
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:24,307
Good night, Ally Al.

245
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:36,944
They forgot to turn off
the ambience again.

246
00:15:37,028 --> 00:15:39,113
Don't worry. It's cool.

247
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,532
You know, I got it.

248
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:50,375
Much better.

249
00:16:13,356 --> 00:16:15,733
Come on, now, baby.

250
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:17,902
My little filet.

251
00:16:17,986 --> 00:16:21,197
My little filet mignon
with a little fat around the edges.

252
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,201
I like that. I like
a little fat on my steak.

253
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:29,539
My sweet, juicy steak.
You are a rare delicacy.

254
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:32,375
Alex. Alex. Alex!

255
00:16:32,417 --> 00:16:33,710
What? What?

256
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:34,919
You suck your thumb?

257
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:36,879
What is it, Melman?

258
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,880
OK, OK.

259
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:39,882
You know how I have
that bladder infection

260
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:41,801
and I have to get up
every two hours?

261
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:45,054
I got up to pee and I looked
over at Marty's pen,

262
00:16:45,054 --> 00:16:46,306
which, you know,
I usually don't do.

263
00:16:46,306 --> 00:16:48,224
I don't know why, but I did.
And listen...

264
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:49,809
What? What's going on?

265
00:16:49,892 --> 00:16:51,686
It's Marty. He's gone.

266
00:16:51,769 --> 00:16:54,397
Gone! What do you mean, "gone"?

267
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,150
How long has he been working on this?

268
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:58,484
Marty!

269
00:16:58,568 --> 00:16:59,902
Marty!

270
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:01,738
He wouldn't fit down there.

271
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,573
Marty? Marty! Marty!

272
00:17:03,614 --> 00:17:06,242
This doesn't make any sense.
Where would he go?

273
00:17:08,202 --> 00:17:10,788
- Connecticut!
- He wouldn't.

274
00:17:10,788 --> 00:17:12,665
Oh, no! What are we going to do?

275
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:13,916
We gotta... we gotta...

276
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,377
I mean, we got to call somebody!

277
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:23,301
Hello? Get me Missing Animals.
And hurry.

278
00:17:23,301 --> 00:17:26,304
We've got a lost zebra probably
on the way to Connecticut by now,

279
00:17:26,304 --> 00:17:27,472
and we're gonna need...

280
00:17:29,807 --> 00:17:32,101
- Hello? Hello?
- Wait a second.

281
00:17:32,143 --> 00:17:34,646
- We can't call the people.
- What the...?

282
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:37,857
They'll be really mad.

283
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,859
It'll get Marty
transferred for good.

284
00:17:39,901 --> 00:17:41,694
You don't bite the hand
that feeds you.

285
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:42,820
Mm-hm, I know that's right.

286
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,572
- We got to go after him.
- Go after him?

287
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:45,907
He's not thinking straight.

288
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:48,951
We gotta stop him from making
the biggest mistake of his life.

289
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:54,123
He's probably out there
lost and cold, confused.

290
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,793
Poor little guy.

291
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:19,691
Melman Come on.

292
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:22,193
You know, maybe one of us should
wait here in case he comes back.

293
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,696
Oh no. Not now. This is an
intervention Melman.

294
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,780
We all got to go.

295
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:27,991
What's the fastest way
to Grand Central?

296
00:18:28,074 --> 00:18:30,076
- You should take Lexington.
- Melman!

297
00:18:30,159 --> 00:18:33,746
- Okay. "We." We should take Lexington.
- What about Park?

298
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:36,416
No, Park goes two ways.
You can't time the lights.

299
00:18:37,667 --> 00:18:41,421
I heard Tom Wolfe
is speaking at Lincoln Center.

300
00:18:43,172 --> 00:18:46,259
Well, of course we're
going to throw poo at him.

301
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:56,352
I knew we should've taken Park.

302
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:59,522
Are you sure this is the fastest
way to Grand Central Station?

303
00:18:59,647 --> 00:19:01,274
I don't know!
That's what Melman said.

304
00:19:01,357 --> 00:19:02,775
Hey. Hey, you, guys.

305
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:06,988
That room has some nifty little
sinks you can wash up in, and look!

306
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,698
Free mints!

307
00:19:08,781 --> 00:19:10,199
This isn't a field trip Melman.

308
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:13,786
This is an urgent mission to save
Marty from throwing his life away.

309
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,413
Now, where's the train?

310
00:19:15,913 --> 00:19:17,123
Here it comes.

311
00:19:20,752 --> 00:19:24,130
What did Marty say to you?
I asked you to talk to him.

312
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:27,717
I did! I did! I don't understand.
He said, "Let's go."

313
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,803
And I said, "What? Are you crazy?"
He says, "I'm ten years old."

314
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:34,641
And he has black-and-white stripes,
and so then we sang and...

315
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:43,483
What you got to do is go
straight back down West 42nd.

316
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:45,234
It's on your left after Vanderbilt.

317
00:19:45,234 --> 00:19:45,860
OK.

318
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:49,072
If you hit the Chrysler Building,
you've gone too far.

319
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,657
Thanks a lot, officer.

320
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,911
Hey! Wait for the light.

321
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:56,996
Freak.

322
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,832
- Did you say "zebra"?
- That's right. A zebra.

323
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,334
Right in front of me.

324
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:02,919
- Can I shoot it?
- Negative.

325
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,588
Then I'm going to need
some backup.

326
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:20,436
- Aw! Knicks lost again.
- What are you going to do.

327
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:23,982
Did that say "Grand Central
Station" or "my aunt's constipation"?

328
00:20:24,023 --> 00:20:25,024
This is it.

329
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:29,570
Grand Central Station.

330
00:20:29,612 --> 00:20:33,032
It's grand and it's central.

331
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:52,468
Move aside.
We have an emergency here.

332
00:20:52,468 --> 00:20:54,345
This is an emergency situation.

333
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:58,558
Hey, hey. Just chill out.
It's not that big of an emergency.

334
00:20:58,641 --> 00:21:00,059
Upstairs, downstairs.

335
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:02,061
How do you like that?

336
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,858
Lady! What is wrong with you?

337
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,986
Ow! Get a grip on yourselves,
people.

338
00:21:10,111 --> 00:21:11,529
You're a bad kitty.

339
00:21:13,364 --> 00:21:16,242
Dagnabbit! I missed the express.

340
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:19,245
Looks like I'll have
to take the Stamford local.

341
00:21:19,329 --> 00:21:21,039
I've got him! I've got him!

342
00:21:21,164 --> 00:21:22,206
He's got him!

343
00:21:22,332 --> 00:21:24,584
He's got him!
He's got him! He's got...

344
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,085
I got something for you!

345
00:21:29,922 --> 00:21:31,174
I'm okay. I'm okay.

346
00:21:31,215 --> 00:21:33,676
Whoa! What are
you guys doing here?

347
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,513
- I am so glad we found you.
- We were so worried about you.

348
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,975
Don't worry, I'm fine, I'm fine.
Look at me. I'm fine.

349
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,103
You're fine?
Oh, he's fine. Oh, great.

350
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:46,939
You hear that? Marty's fine.
That's good to know.

351
00:21:46,981 --> 00:21:48,608
Because I was just wondering...

352
00:21:48,691 --> 00:21:51,778
How could you do this to us Marty?
I thought we were your friends!

353
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:54,113
What's the big deal?
I was coming back in the morning.

354
00:21:54,155 --> 00:21:56,282
Don't you ever do this again.
Do you hear me?

355
00:21:56,366 --> 00:21:59,118
- Do you hear him?
- Guys, we're running out of time.

356
00:21:59,202 --> 00:22:01,079
Oh, Melman,
you broke their clock?

357
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,540
...do this again! Don't you ever,
ever do this again!

358
00:22:04,874 --> 00:22:06,125
Come here.

359
00:22:12,215 --> 00:22:14,968
We've been ratted out, boys.

360
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:16,594
Hold your fire!

361
00:22:22,892 --> 00:22:25,645
Cute and cuddly, boys.
Cute and cuddly.

362
00:22:29,482 --> 00:22:31,901
If you have any poo,
fling it now.

363
00:22:34,237 --> 00:22:36,155
It's the Man.

364
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,325
Good evening, officers.

365
00:22:39,409 --> 00:22:41,953
No. No. No.
You don't talk now. Okay?

366
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:43,830
You're not so good with the
"putting words together

367
00:22:43,871 --> 00:22:47,000
and their coming out good" thing.
You keep it "shh."

368
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:50,586
Hey! How you doing? Yeah.
You know what? Everything's cool.

369
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:54,507
We just had a little situation here.
Little internal situation.

370
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,426
Actually my friend just
went a little crazy.

371
00:22:56,426 --> 00:22:57,593
Happens to everybody.

372
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,680
The city gets to us all. Just
went a little cuckoo in the head.

373
00:23:00,763 --> 00:23:02,682
Hey! Don't be calling me
cuckoo in the head.

374
00:23:02,724 --> 00:23:06,686
Just shush! I will handle this.

375
00:23:06,686 --> 00:23:08,021
Oh! I got him!

376
00:23:08,021 --> 00:23:10,023
Go, go, go! Right here, please.

377
00:23:10,023 --> 00:23:12,191
Would you give a guy a break?

378
00:23:13,693 --> 00:23:15,862
We're just gonna take my
little friend here home and...

379
00:23:16,112 --> 00:23:18,072
forget this ever happened.
All right?

380
00:23:18,948 --> 00:23:20,450
No harm, no foul, right?

381
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:21,367
Oh. No, no, no.

382
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:25,788
Hey, it's cool. It's me,
Alex the lion. From the zoo.

383
00:23:30,209 --> 00:23:32,128
What's the matter with them?

384
00:23:41,804 --> 00:23:45,475
I feel really, really weird.

385
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,978
I love you guys.

386
00:23:49,979 --> 00:23:52,815
I love you so much.

387
00:24:13,419 --> 00:24:16,255
Last night's dramatic incident
in Grand Central

388
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:20,259
is an example of what animal rights
whackos have been shouting for years:

389
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:23,346
Animals clearly
don't belong in captivity.

390
00:24:23,429 --> 00:24:25,932
Now they are to be sent back
to their natural habitat,

391
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:29,936
where they will live their lives in the
freedom they so clearly desire.

392
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:33,022
- Hey. Little help?
- He's awake! He's awake!

393
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,941
Do something!

394
00:24:35,692 --> 00:24:37,527
Oh, man.

395
00:24:49,372 --> 00:24:50,957
Oh, my head.

396
00:24:53,543 --> 00:24:54,877
What the...?

397
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:57,380
Wait. Where? What?

398
00:24:58,214 --> 00:25:01,884
I'm in a box! Oh, no.
No, no! Not the box.

399
00:25:01,968 --> 00:25:05,555
Oh, no, they can't
transfer me. Not me!

400
00:25:05,638 --> 00:25:08,641
Oh, I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

401
00:25:08,725 --> 00:25:10,643
Darkness creeping in.

402
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:12,979
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

403
00:25:13,062 --> 00:25:15,231
Walls closing in around me.

404
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:18,568
So alone. So alone.

405
00:25:18,651 --> 00:25:21,571
- Alex! Alex, are you there?
- Marty?

406
00:25:21,654 --> 00:25:24,907
- Yeah! Talk to me, buddy.
- Oh, Marty! You're here!

407
00:25:24,991 --> 00:25:27,827
- What's going on? Are you okay?
- This doesn't look good Marty.

408
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,996
- Alex, Marty, is that you?
- Gloria!

409
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:33,166
- You're here too!
- I am loving the sound of your voice.

410
00:25:33,249 --> 00:25:35,501
- What is going on?
- We're all in crates.

411
00:25:35,585 --> 00:25:36,669
Oh, no!

412
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,423
- Sleeping just knocks me out.
- Melman!

413
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:41,591
Is that Melman?

414
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,344
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. No, I'm fine.

415
00:25:44,427 --> 00:25:47,263
I often doze off
while I'm getting an MRI.

416
00:25:47,347 --> 00:25:49,641
- Melman you're not getting an MRI.
- CAT scan?

417
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:53,102
No! No CAT scan. It's a transfer.
It's a zoo transfer.

418
00:25:53,186 --> 00:25:56,689
Zoo transfer?! Oh, no.
No, no, I can't be transferred.

419
00:25:56,689 --> 00:25:59,359
I have an appointment
with Dr. Goldberg at 5:00.

420
00:25:59,359 --> 00:26:02,028
There are prescriptions
that have to be filled.

421
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:04,697
No other zoo could
afford my medical care.

422
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,366
And I am not going HMO.

423
00:26:06,449 --> 00:26:09,202
Take it easy, Melman.
It's going to be okay.

424
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:13,873
- We are going to be okizay.
- No, we're not going to be okizay.

425
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:16,125
Now, because of you, we're ruined!

426
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:19,712
Because of me? I fail
to see how this is my fault.

427
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:23,216
- You're kidding, right, Marty?
- You. You ticked off the people.

428
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:25,802
You bit the hand, Marty.
You bit the hand.

429
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:27,887
I don't know who I am,
I don't know who I am.

430
00:26:27,887 --> 00:26:29,555
I gotta go find myself in the wild!

431
00:26:29,597 --> 00:26:30,640
- Hey hey!
- Oh please.

432
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,810
I did not ask you to
come after me, did I?

433
00:26:33,851 --> 00:26:35,395
- He does have a point.
- What?

434
00:26:35,478 --> 00:26:38,815
I did say we should stay
at the zoo, but you guys...

435
00:26:38,856 --> 00:26:40,274
Melman, just shut it.

436
00:26:40,316 --> 00:26:42,568
You're the one that suggested this
whole idea to happen in the first place.

437
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:45,071
- Alex. Leave Melman out of this.
- Thank you, Gloria.

438
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:47,490
Besides, Alex, it's not my fault
that we were transferred.

439
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,827
Melman, shut it.
Does anybody feel nauseous?

440
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:54,747
- I feel nauseous.
- Melman, you always feel nauseous.

441
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,587
Progress report.

442
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:04,841
It's an older code, Skipper.
I can't make it out.

443
00:27:04,924 --> 00:27:07,010
You, higher mammal.

444
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,511
Can you read?

445
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:11,764
No. Phil can read, though. Phil.

446
00:27:15,435 --> 00:27:19,105
Ship to Kenya.

447
00:27:19,105 --> 00:27:21,774
Wildlife preserve.

448
00:27:21,858 --> 00:27:22,942
Africa!

449
00:27:23,026 --> 00:27:26,195
Africa?
That ain't going to fly. Rico.

450
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:11,491
I was the star
in the greatest city on Earth.

451
00:28:11,491 --> 00:28:13,993
- Guys, listen.
- A king. Loved by my people.

452
00:28:14,077 --> 00:28:16,746
- Let's just be civil.
- And you've ruined everything!

453
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:17,914
- "Loved"?
- Guys, guys.

454
00:28:17,997 --> 00:28:19,374
If the people loved you,

455
00:28:19,374 --> 00:28:22,293
it's only because they
didn't know the real you!

456
00:28:22,335 --> 00:28:25,338
Don't make me come up there.
I'd get to woopin'on both of you all!

457
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:26,923
I thought I knew the real you!

458
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:30,593
Your black-and-white stripes,
they cancel each other out.

459
00:28:30,635 --> 00:28:31,970
You're nothing!

460
00:28:32,011 --> 00:28:33,596
Stop it, stop it, stop it!

461
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,848
You're not helping the situation.

462
00:28:36,349 --> 00:28:37,684
Status.

463
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:40,937
It's no good Skipper.
I don't know the codes.

464
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,774
Don't give me excuses.
Give me results! Navigation.

465
00:28:48,111 --> 00:28:50,530
All right. Let me think.

466
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,198
And shut him up!

467
00:28:55,368 --> 00:28:58,705
- I did it!
- Let's get this tin can turned around.

468
00:29:25,231 --> 00:29:26,399
Guys?

469
00:29:27,483 --> 00:29:28,568
Oh, no.

470
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:29,902
Gloria!

471
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,237
Melman!

472
00:29:31,404 --> 00:29:32,488
Marty!

473
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,241
Alex!

474
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:36,826
Marty?!

475
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:39,579
Alex!

476
00:29:39,662 --> 00:29:40,997
Marty!

477
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:44,000
No, wait. Come back, Marty!

478
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:46,085
Don't go.

479
00:30:31,881 --> 00:30:33,299
Marty?

480
00:30:34,384 --> 00:30:35,802
Melman?

481
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,471
Gloria?

482
00:30:42,308 --> 00:30:43,559
Marty?!

483
00:30:43,643 --> 00:30:44,894
Melman?!

484
00:30:44,978 --> 00:30:46,479
Gloria?!

485
00:30:48,731 --> 00:30:49,732
Marty!

486
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:53,903
Melman! Gloria!

487
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,657
Hey, anyone! Hello!

488
00:31:01,661 --> 00:31:05,164
Marty, Melman, Gloria.

489
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:09,335
Gloria, Melman, Marty.
Marty, Gelman, Gloria. Marty, Melman.

490
00:31:09,419 --> 00:31:11,921
Morty, Morty, Gelman. Regis. Kelly.

491
00:31:12,005 --> 00:31:13,923
Matt, Katie, Al.

492
00:31:18,428 --> 00:31:21,681
Get me out of this thing.
Somebody. Hello?

493
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:24,767
Get me out of this
thing right now!

494
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:27,353
Hello? Somebody?

495
00:31:27,437 --> 00:31:28,688
Melman!

496
00:31:28,771 --> 00:31:30,606
Alex? Is that you?

497
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,694
Melman, I got you. Hang on!
Hang on. I got you.

498
00:31:39,699 --> 00:31:42,535
Melman! I got you, buddy.

499
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:50,710
Wait a sec, Melman.
Wait right there.

500
00:31:51,294 --> 00:31:54,213
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting you out of the box.

501
00:31:55,715 --> 00:31:57,884
- Relax.
- Alex?

502
00:31:58,885 --> 00:32:01,471
Giraffe, corner pocket!

503
00:32:02,388 --> 00:32:03,806
- Wait! Wait! Come on.
- Here goes nothing!

504
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,975
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Hold still!

505
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,644
- Wait, Alex.
- Hold still.

506
00:32:07,727 --> 00:32:09,812
- No, come on.
- Here I come!

507
00:32:09,896 --> 00:32:11,731
Look! Look! Look! Look!

508
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:14,901
It's Gloria. It's Gloria!

509
00:32:16,152 --> 00:32:18,321
Oh, hey, it is Gloria.

510
00:32:18,404 --> 00:32:19,489
Oh, my...

511
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:20,907
Gloria!

512
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:31,250
Gloria!

513
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:37,924
Alrighty, boys, fun's over.

514
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:39,092
Gloria!

515
00:32:39,175 --> 00:32:40,677
Alex!

516
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:45,014
- Marty?!
- Marty!

517
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:49,268
Yeah! All right! That's right!

518
00:32:49,352 --> 00:32:53,356
Left! Left! Left. No, no,
your left! Your left! Your left!

519
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:56,025
Right here's good.

520
00:32:56,776 --> 00:32:59,028
You know, I don't really have
anything on me right now.

521
00:32:59,028 --> 00:33:00,071
I'll have to get you later.

522
00:33:04,033 --> 00:33:05,451
To you too.

523
00:33:07,537 --> 00:33:09,122
Marty!

524
00:33:09,205 --> 00:33:10,540
Marty!

525
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:14,794
Alex!

526
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,215
Marty!

527
00:33:19,299 --> 00:33:20,800
Alex!

528
00:33:20,883 --> 00:33:22,218
Marty!

529
00:33:22,302 --> 00:33:23,553
Al!

530
00:33:23,636 --> 00:33:25,972
Marty!

531
00:33:26,055 --> 00:33:28,141
Alex?

532
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:29,726
Marty!

533
00:33:31,728 --> 00:33:33,980
Oh, sugar, honey, ice tea.

534
00:33:34,063 --> 00:33:35,148
- Marty!
- Hey!

535
00:33:35,231 --> 00:33:36,983
- Hold up! Hold up!
- I'm going to kill you!

536
00:33:36,983 --> 00:33:39,402
Come here!
Don't run away from me!

537
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:39,986
Calm down! Calm down!

538
00:33:39,986 --> 00:33:42,989
If you keep running,
I'm going to just kill you more!

539
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,491
Oh, look at us.

540
00:33:45,575 --> 00:33:48,911
We're all here together.
Safe and sound.

541
00:33:48,995 --> 00:33:50,997
Yeah, here we are.

542
00:33:52,081 --> 00:33:54,917
Where exactly is "here"?

543
00:34:07,764 --> 00:34:09,265
San Diego.

544
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:10,933
San Diego?

545
00:34:11,017 --> 00:34:12,518
White sandy beaches,

546
00:34:12,602 --> 00:34:16,773
cleverly simulated natural
environment, wide-open enclosures.

547
00:34:16,856 --> 00:34:19,942
I'm telling you,
this could be the San Diego Zoo.

548
00:34:20,026 --> 00:34:22,111
Complete with fake rocks.

549
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,946
Wow, that looks real.

550
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:28,284
San Diego? What could
be worse than San Diego?

551
00:34:28,368 --> 00:34:31,454
I don't know.
This place is crackalacking!

552
00:34:31,537 --> 00:34:34,707
Oh, I could hang here.
I could hang here.

553
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:36,876
- I'm gonna kill you, Marty!
- Take it easy! Take it easy!

554
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:38,127
- And then strangle you!
- Calm down.

555
00:34:38,211 --> 00:34:41,297
Then bury you, dig you up and
clone you, and kill all your clones..

556
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:44,217
- 20-second timeout.
- And then, I'll never talk to you again.

557
00:34:44,258 --> 00:34:46,803
Look. We're just
going to find the people,

558
00:34:46,886 --> 00:34:51,391
get checked in and have
this mess straightened out.

559
00:34:52,725 --> 00:34:55,228
Oh, great.
This is just great. San Diego.

560
00:34:55,311 --> 00:34:59,232
Now I'll have to compete
with Shamu and his smug little grin.

561
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:01,317
I can't top that. Can't top it.

562
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:04,988
I'm ruined! I'm done.
I'm out of the business.

563
00:35:05,071 --> 00:35:08,241
It's your fault, Marty!
You've ruined me.

564
00:35:08,324 --> 00:35:10,994
Come on, Alex.
Do you honestly think

565
00:35:11,077 --> 00:35:13,413
I intended all of this to happen?

566
00:35:13,496 --> 00:35:16,416
You want me to say that I'm sorry?
Is that what you want?

567
00:35:16,499 --> 00:35:17,500
Okay, I'm...

568
00:35:18,751 --> 00:35:20,169
He just shushed me.

569
00:35:20,253 --> 00:35:23,339
Marty, look, you've got
to be just a little bit more und...

570
00:35:23,923 --> 00:35:26,050
- Don't you shush me.
- Do you hear that?

571
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,093
Don't you hear that?

572
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,181
I hear it now.

573
00:35:32,181 --> 00:35:33,433
Where there's music,
there's people.

574
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,269
- We go right to the head honcho.
- A sidewalk would be nice.

575
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:37,937
Yeah, what a dump.

576
00:35:37,979 --> 00:35:40,315
They should call it
the San Di-Lame-O zoo!

577
00:35:40,315 --> 00:35:43,609
First they tell you hey! We got
this great open plan thing.

578
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:45,361
Let the animals run wild!

579
00:35:45,611 --> 00:35:46,404
Next thing you know it...

580
00:35:46,404 --> 00:35:49,115
flowers in your hair, and
everybody's hugging everybody.

581
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:52,619
This place kind of grows on you.
This way, guys! Come on!

582
00:36:00,376 --> 00:36:01,711
What the...?

583
00:36:11,596 --> 00:36:12,639
Oh, no!

584
00:36:19,729 --> 00:36:22,982
Okay, let's make
a good impression on the people.

585
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,985
Smiles, everyone.
Let's get it together.

586
00:36:26,069 --> 00:36:29,572
- Is that the best you can do Melman?
- Oh, I'm not smiling. It's gas.

587
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:31,991
Okay well great.
Let's make gas look good.

588
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:42,335
- Wow!
- It's not people. It's animals.

589
00:36:42,418 --> 00:36:44,712
California animals. Dude.

590
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:46,589
This is like a Puffy party.

591
00:37:07,276 --> 00:37:09,862
All girls all over the world

592
00:37:09,988 --> 00:37:13,199
Original King Julien!
What a girl's man!

593
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:16,744
I love all them girls
I love to move them body!

594
00:37:16,744 --> 00:37:18,121
When you move your body,

595
00:37:18,162 --> 00:37:20,999
you know, move it nice and
sweet and sassy.

596
00:37:22,125 --> 00:37:23,543
What kind of zoo is this?

597
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:27,046
I just saw 26 blatant
health code violations.

598
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:30,133
I'm loving San Diego.
This place is off the chizain.

599
00:37:30,216 --> 00:37:31,301
Twenty-seven.

600
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:41,144
We should've brought chips and dip.

601
00:37:41,269 --> 00:37:42,478
Wait.

602
00:37:42,562 --> 00:37:45,064
Where's Alex?
What happened to him?

603
00:37:45,106 --> 00:37:46,983
He was right behind us.
Wasn't he right behind us?

604
00:37:46,983 --> 00:37:49,736
I don't know where he's at,
but he's missing one heck of a party.

605
00:37:49,819 --> 00:37:51,487
The fossa!

606
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:52,989
The fossa!

607
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:55,742
The fossa are attacking!
Run for your lives!

608
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:05,501
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

609
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,589
I hate spiderwebs.

610
00:38:09,672 --> 00:38:11,591
Yeah, thanks a lot, guys.

611
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:14,886
Thanks for waiting up.
Really appreciate it.

612
00:38:17,847 --> 00:38:21,768
Hey, hi. We just got in from New York,
and we're looking for a supervisor.

613
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:25,188
Because we've been sitting
on that beach back there for hours,

614
00:38:25,271 --> 00:38:27,649
and nobody's even bothered to show up.

615
00:38:27,774 --> 00:38:29,025
I don't know how things are...

616
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:31,152
Yeah, I don't know how things
are normally run around here,

617
00:38:31,194 --> 00:38:34,113
but obviously there's been some
sort of major screw up, which is cool.

618
00:38:34,197 --> 00:38:38,284
So if you could just point us towards
the administrative offices, we'll just uhh...

619
00:38:38,368 --> 00:38:39,285
Well, howdy-do.

620
00:38:46,542 --> 00:38:48,878
Spider! Spider!
Spider on my back!

621
00:38:48,962 --> 00:38:52,048
Maurice, did you see that?

622
00:38:52,173 --> 00:38:54,384
He scared the fossa away.

623
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,553
Come on, Gloria. Get it.

624
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:00,515
Get it! Get it! Get it!

625
00:39:00,515 --> 00:39:02,976
- That's it! Smack it!
- Get it, get it!

626
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,395
Whip it! Whip it good!
Where'd it go?

627
00:39:05,478 --> 00:39:09,649
King Julien, what are they?
What are they?!

628
00:39:09,732 --> 00:39:14,737
They are aliens. Savage aliens
from the savage future.

629
00:39:14,821 --> 00:39:17,365
They've come to kill us.
And take our women.

630
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:18,700
And our precious metals.

631
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:23,997
Get up, Mort. Do not
be near the king's feet, okay?

632
00:39:25,248 --> 00:39:28,668
We're hiding. Be quiet,
everyone. Including me.

633
00:39:28,751 --> 00:39:30,420
Who's making that noise?

634
00:39:30,503 --> 00:39:31,671
Oh, it's me again.

635
00:39:31,796 --> 00:39:34,007
There it is! Get it! Come on, Gloria!

636
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,343
- Enough! Enough with the stick.
- I think she got it.

637
00:39:37,427 --> 00:39:39,887
Is it still on me?
I hate spiders.

638
00:39:40,346 --> 00:39:42,098
It's okay. It's gone.

639
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:44,767
They are savages.

640
00:39:44,809 --> 00:39:46,019
Tonight we die.

641
00:39:46,144 --> 00:39:49,188
The feet. I told you...
I told you to... I told every...

642
00:39:49,272 --> 00:39:51,190
Didn't I tell him about the feet?

643
00:39:51,858 --> 00:39:54,444
He did tell you about the feet.

644
00:39:55,862 --> 00:39:58,906
- Wait. I have a plan.
- Really?

645
00:39:59,032 --> 00:40:01,367
I have devised a cunning test

646
00:40:01,451 --> 00:40:05,163
to see whether
these are savage killers.

647
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,712
Hi there.

648
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:17,300
You let me handle it.
Alex handles it. Marty does nothing.

649
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:23,139
Hi there.

650
00:40:26,976 --> 00:40:29,312
Oh, jeez. Sorry.

651
00:40:29,395 --> 00:40:32,148
- Oh, Alex, what'd you do?
- No, no, no. Stop. Stop.

652
00:40:32,148 --> 00:40:33,691
It's okay. It's okay.

653
00:40:33,733 --> 00:40:37,236
I'm just a silly... Just a silly lion.
Oh, jeez!

654
00:40:40,865 --> 00:40:43,493
- Aw, Alex!
- Oh, you poor little baby.

655
00:40:43,576 --> 00:40:46,162
Did that big mean lion scare you?

656
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:50,667
He did? He's a big,
bad old puddy tat, isn't he?

657
00:40:50,792 --> 00:40:53,920
Come on. Mama'll hold you.
Awww, look at you.

658
00:40:54,003 --> 00:40:56,255
They are so cute
from a reasonable distance.

659
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:00,843
Aren't you the sweetest little thing.
I just want to dunk him in my coffee.

660
00:41:00,843 --> 00:41:03,805
They're just a bunch of pansies.

661
00:41:03,805 --> 00:41:05,181
I don't know.

662
00:41:05,264 --> 00:41:08,184
There's still something about
that one with the crazy hairdo

663
00:41:08,226 --> 00:41:10,311
that I find suspicious.

664
00:41:10,436 --> 00:41:11,938
Nonsense, Maurice.

665
00:41:12,021 --> 00:41:16,109
Come on, everybody.
Let's go and meet the pansies!

666
00:41:27,704 --> 00:41:31,124
Presenting your royal highness,
our illustrious King Julien XIII,

667
00:41:31,124 --> 00:41:34,961
self-proclaimed lord of the lemurs,
etc etc. Hooray, everybody.

668
00:41:41,884 --> 00:41:43,386
He's got style.

669
00:41:50,226 --> 00:41:52,729
What is he, like,
king of the guinea pigs?

670
00:41:54,731 --> 00:41:56,190
I think it's a squirrel.

671
00:41:56,232 --> 00:41:59,402
Welcome, giant pansies.

672
00:41:59,485 --> 00:42:02,238
Please feel free to bask in my glow.

673
00:42:02,322 --> 00:42:03,990
- Definitely a squirrel.
- Yep. Squirrel.

674
00:42:04,032 --> 00:42:09,162
We thank you with enormous gratitude
for chasing away the fossa.

675
00:42:09,245 --> 00:42:11,331
- The "whossa"?
- The fossa.

676
00:42:11,414 --> 00:42:15,418
They're always annoying us by
trespassing, interrupting our parties,

677
00:42:15,418 --> 00:42:17,879
- and ripping our limbs off.
- Yes, sounds good. Look, we're just...

678
00:42:17,879 --> 00:42:19,464
We're just trying to find out
where the people are, so...

679
00:42:19,505 --> 00:42:22,675
Oh. Wow.
What big teeth you have. Man!

680
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:24,093
Shame on you, Maurice.

681
00:42:24,093 --> 00:42:26,679
Can you not see that
you have insulted the freak?

682
00:42:27,597 --> 00:42:30,099
You must tell me,
who the heck are you?

683
00:42:30,183 --> 00:42:33,853
I'm Alex. The Alex.
And this is Gloria, Marty and Melman.

684
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:37,649
And just where are you
giants from?

685
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,776
We're from New York and...

686
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,528
All hail the New York giants!

687
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:44,864
New York giants!

688
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,160
What are we doing, some
sort of inbreeding program?

689
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:52,622
I say we just got to ask these
bozos where the people are.

690
00:42:52,705 --> 00:42:56,042
Excuse me. We bozos
have the people, of course.

691
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:59,128
Hey, the bozos have the people.

692
00:42:59,212 --> 00:43:02,715
Oh, well, great. Good. Phew.

693
00:43:02,799 --> 00:43:04,258
They're up there.

694
00:43:07,971 --> 00:43:12,141
Don't you love the people?
Not a very lively bunch, though.

695
00:43:12,225 --> 00:43:13,309
Wow.

696
00:43:13,351 --> 00:43:16,145
So do you have any live people?

697
00:43:17,146 --> 00:43:18,982
No. Only dead ones.

698
00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:22,068
I mean, if we had
a lot of live people here,

699
00:43:22,151 --> 00:43:25,655
it wouldn't be called
the wild, would it?

700
00:43:25,738 --> 00:43:27,073
The wild?

701
00:43:27,156 --> 00:43:30,243
Whoa. Hold up there
a second, fuzzbucket.

702
00:43:30,326 --> 00:43:31,160
You mean, like,

703
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:36,291
like the "live in a mud hut, wipe
yourself with a leaf" type wild?

704
00:43:36,332 --> 00:43:38,918
- Who wipes?
- Oy vey.

705
00:43:39,002 --> 00:43:40,753
- Oy vey!
- Oy vey, everybody!

706
00:43:40,837 --> 00:43:42,755
Oy vey!

707
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:45,174
Could you excuse me
for a moment?

708
00:43:49,595 --> 00:43:51,889
Get me out of here!
We got to get out of here!

709
00:43:51,889 --> 00:43:52,932
Alex!

710
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,768
- Help!
- What are you doing?!

711
00:43:55,852 --> 00:43:58,021
I'm swimming back to New York.

712
00:43:58,104 --> 00:44:01,065
I know my chances are slim,
but I have to try!

713
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:04,736
- You can't swim!
- I said my chances are slim!

714
00:44:04,777 --> 00:44:09,657
Nature! It's all over me!
Get it off! I can't see! I can't see!

715
00:44:11,367 --> 00:44:13,202
I can see!

716
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:17,498
OK look. There's obviously
just been a little mistake.

717
00:44:17,624 --> 00:44:20,126
I'm sure the people didn't
dump us here on purpose.

718
00:44:20,209 --> 00:44:22,128
As soon as they realize
what happened,

719
00:44:22,128 --> 00:44:23,671
they'll come looking for us, right?

720
00:44:24,547 --> 00:44:25,632
Yeah, right.

721
00:44:25,715 --> 00:44:29,761
I don't know the words.
But we're born free.

722
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:33,389
You know something?
I bet they're already on their way.

723
00:44:39,729 --> 00:44:44,233
Well, boys, it's going
to be ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

724
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,738
Rico.

725
00:44:51,491 --> 00:44:55,536
Well, since I'm doomed
to die on this forsaken island,

726
00:44:55,578 --> 00:44:57,914
I, Melman Mankiewicz,

727
00:44:57,997 --> 00:45:01,334
being of sound mind
and unsound body,

728
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:05,588
have divided my estate
equally among the three of you.

729
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:08,091
Sorry, Alex.

730
00:45:08,174 --> 00:45:12,845
Hey! A latrine. Nice work, Melman.
Outdoor plumbing.

731
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:14,847
No, it's not a latrine.

732
00:45:14,931 --> 00:45:19,185
It's a grave. You sent Melman
to his grave. Are you happy?

733
00:45:19,268 --> 00:45:20,561
Aw, come on.

734
00:45:20,603 --> 00:45:24,107
This isn't the end.
This is a whole new beginning.

735
00:45:24,107 --> 00:45:26,442
This could be the best thing
that's ever happened to us!

736
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:28,528
No. No. No. No.

737
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:30,863
No. No. No. No. No. No.

738
00:45:30,863 --> 00:45:32,824
This is not the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

739
00:45:32,865 --> 00:45:35,410
Yeah. You abused the power of
the birthday wish

740
00:45:35,410 --> 00:45:37,245
and brought this bad luck
on all of us.

741
00:45:37,287 --> 00:45:39,706
Why'd you tell us your wish?
You're not supposed to do that.

742
00:45:39,789 --> 00:45:42,375
Wait a minute. I didn't want to
tell you. Remember?

743
00:45:42,458 --> 00:45:45,962
- You guys made me tell you.
- Oh, okay.

744
00:45:46,045 --> 00:45:49,716
Besides, this isn't bad luck.
This is good luck.

745
00:45:49,799 --> 00:45:52,635
Look around. There's no fences,
no schedules.

746
00:45:52,719 --> 00:45:55,138
This place is beautiful.
Baby, we were born...

747
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:57,724
Okay. Okay.
I've had enough of this.

748
00:45:57,807 --> 00:46:02,812
This is your side of the island,
and this is our side of the island.

749
00:46:02,812 --> 00:46:04,188
That is the bad side,

750
00:46:04,188 --> 00:46:07,066
where you can prance and skip
around like a magical pixie horse.

751
00:46:07,066 --> 00:46:09,610
And do whatever the hack you
wanna do all day long. And this..

752
00:46:09,694 --> 00:46:10,778
This is the good side of the island,

753
00:46:10,778 --> 00:46:12,905
for those who love New York
and care about going home.

754
00:46:12,947 --> 00:46:15,992
- Come on.
- No, no. Back! Back!

755
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:17,827
You know what? This isn't good.

756
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,248
Okay! You all have your side,
and I'll have mine.

757
00:46:22,332 --> 00:46:25,168
And if you need me,
I'll be over here,

758
00:46:25,251 --> 00:46:29,172
on the fun side of the island,
having a good old time.

759
00:46:29,255 --> 00:46:30,673
This is the fun side,

760
00:46:30,673 --> 00:46:32,592
this is the fun side where
we're gonna have a great time

761
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:34,093
surviving until we go home.

762
00:46:34,093 --> 00:46:35,637
- A yabbadabbado old time!
- I love this side.

763
00:46:35,637 --> 00:46:36,679
This side's the best.

764
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:40,516
That side stinks! You're on
the Jersey side of this cesspool!

765
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,852
- Wilma!
- Well. Now what do we do?

766
00:46:42,935 --> 00:46:45,355
Don't worry Melman. I have
a plan to get us rescued.

767
00:46:47,607 --> 00:46:51,611
Can't wait to see the look
on Marty's face when he sees this.

768
00:46:55,031 --> 00:46:58,451
Just look at him.
He's helpless without us.

769
00:47:07,961 --> 00:47:09,629
Shut up, Spalding.

770
00:47:14,717 --> 00:47:17,804
I've been standing
here for hours, man.

771
00:47:17,887 --> 00:47:20,556
How long do I have
to pose like this?

772
00:47:21,307 --> 00:47:23,726
She is finito.

773
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:30,191
I defy any rescue boat within
a million miles to miss this baby.

774
00:47:30,650 --> 00:47:34,904
When the moment is right,
we will ignite the beacon of liberty

775
00:47:34,904 --> 00:47:38,658
and be rescued
from this awful nightmare!

776
00:47:38,741 --> 00:47:40,660
What do you think?
Pretty cool, huh?

777
00:47:41,494 --> 00:47:43,204
How's the liberty fire going,
Melman?

778
00:47:43,204 --> 00:47:44,789
Great. Idiot.

779
00:47:44,914 --> 00:47:46,416
I heard that.

780
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:49,085
Why can't we just borrow
some of Marty's fire?

781
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:54,340
That's wild fire. We're not
using wild fire on Lady Liberty.

782
00:47:54,424 --> 00:47:57,343
- Now, rub, Melman.
- I've been doing...

783
00:47:57,427 --> 00:48:02,015
I can't. I can't.
I can't do it. I ju... I can't do it!

784
00:48:03,349 --> 00:48:04,434
Fire.

785
00:48:05,685 --> 00:48:06,686
Fire.

786
00:48:08,271 --> 00:48:10,356
Fire! Fire!

787
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,528
Oh, my.

788
00:48:16,112 --> 00:48:17,196
Fire!

789
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:19,115
Not yet! No, no! No!

790
00:48:19,198 --> 00:48:20,700
Fire!

791
00:48:20,783 --> 00:48:22,201
Melman, hold still!

792
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:24,954
Jump! Alex, jump!

793
00:48:25,038 --> 00:48:27,290
Don't worry,
cats always land on their...

794
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:31,127
Face?
Man, what kind of cat are you?

795
00:48:39,802 --> 00:48:41,721
You maniac!

796
00:48:42,138 --> 00:48:44,307
You burned it up!

797
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:46,643
Darn you!

798
00:48:46,726 --> 00:48:49,562
Darn you all to heck!

799
00:48:49,979 --> 00:48:52,148
Can we go to the fun side now?

800
00:48:53,483 --> 00:48:56,569
Everybody, calm down.
Come on. Into your chairs.

801
00:48:56,653 --> 00:48:59,405
Yes. Everybody, please.
Calm down. Let go of his tail.

802
00:48:59,489 --> 00:49:01,991
Separate those two,
would you, please?

803
00:49:01,991 --> 00:49:03,034
You over here,
and you over there.

804
00:49:03,034 --> 00:49:04,077
Everyone... Shhh.

805
00:49:04,494 --> 00:49:07,330
Calm down, people, okay?

806
00:49:07,413 --> 00:49:11,668
Now, presenting your royal highness,
the illustrious blah, blah, blah.

807
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:14,921
You know, et cetera, et cetera.
Hooray. Let's go.

808
00:49:15,004 --> 00:49:16,589
Now, everybody,

809
00:49:16,673 --> 00:49:21,344
we all have great curiosity about
our guests, the New York giants.

810
00:49:21,427 --> 00:49:23,346
- Yes, Willie?
- I like them.

811
00:49:23,429 --> 00:49:25,473
I like them. I like them.
I liked them first.

812
00:49:25,473 --> 00:49:27,600
Before I even met them
I liked them.

813
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,435
- Yes. Yes. Yes!
- I liked them right away.

814
00:49:29,435 --> 00:49:31,270
You hate them compared to
how much I like them.

815
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:33,523
Oh, shut up. You're so annoying!

816
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:37,944
Now, for as long as
we can remember,

817
00:49:38,027 --> 00:49:42,365
we have been attacked
and eaten by the dreaded fossa.

818
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:45,535
The fossa!
The fossa are attacking!

819
00:49:49,038 --> 00:49:51,541
It's a cookbook! It's a cookbook!

820
00:49:51,624 --> 00:49:53,209
Please. Maurice.

821
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:56,045
Shhh. Quiet!

822
00:49:56,129 --> 00:50:00,300
Come on, y'all. They ain't
attacking us this very instant!

823
00:50:01,884 --> 00:50:05,221
So my genius plan is this:

824
00:50:05,305 --> 00:50:07,724
We will make the New York giants

825
00:50:07,724 --> 00:50:10,643
our friends and keep them close.

826
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:14,063
Then, with Mr. Alex protecting us,

827
00:50:14,063 --> 00:50:17,483
we will be safe
and never have to worry

828
00:50:17,567 --> 00:50:21,321
about the dreaded fossa ever again.

829
00:50:23,656 --> 00:50:25,950
I thought of that.
I thought of that.

830
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:28,786
- Yes. Me. I did.
- Hold on, everybody. Hold on.

831
00:50:28,786 --> 00:50:30,079
I'm just thinking now.

832
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:33,416
I mean, does anyone
wonder why the fossa

833
00:50:33,416 --> 00:50:36,002
were so scared of Mr. Alex?

834
00:50:36,085 --> 00:50:39,422
I mean,
maybe we should be scared too.

835
00:50:39,422 --> 00:50:42,508
What if Mr. Alex
is even worse than the fossa?

836
00:50:43,926 --> 00:50:47,263
I'm telling you that dude just
gives me the heebiedabajeebies.

837
00:50:47,263 --> 00:50:49,766
Maurice,
you did not raise your hand.

838
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:53,603
Therefore, your heinous comment
will be stricken from the record.

839
00:50:55,271 --> 00:50:58,107
Does anyone else
have the heebie-jeebies?

840
00:50:58,107 --> 00:51:00,610
No? Good. So shut up.

841
00:51:01,110 --> 00:51:03,947
When the New York giants wake up,

842
00:51:03,947 --> 00:51:09,619
we will make sure
that they wake up in paradise.

843
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:13,289
Now, who would like a cookie?

844
00:51:37,981 --> 00:51:42,819
Yo, Al. Melman and Gloria
are over there having a good time.

845
00:51:42,902 --> 00:51:45,405
There's room
on the fun side for one more.

846
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:47,156
No, thanks.

847
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,242
Look, I've been thinking.

848
00:51:49,242 --> 00:51:51,452
Maybe if you gave
this place a chance,

849
00:51:51,494 --> 00:51:54,414
I don't know, you might
even enjoy yourself.

850
00:51:54,497 --> 00:51:58,001
Marty, I'm tired. I'm hungry.

851
00:51:58,084 --> 00:52:00,003
I just want to go home.

852
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:05,091
Could you just give it a chance?
Think about it.

853
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:08,928
It really isn't
the fun side without you.

854
00:52:24,777 --> 00:52:26,362
I know. And then...

855
00:52:29,365 --> 00:52:31,451
- It's him.
- Who is it?

856
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:35,288
It's the pizza man.
Who the heck do you think it is?

857
00:52:35,622 --> 00:52:37,957
Yes? Can I help you?

858
00:52:38,708 --> 00:52:40,209
Can I come to the fun side?

859
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,963
Beg your pardon?

860
00:52:44,714 --> 00:52:46,966
You know,
I've been kind of a jerk Marty.

861
00:52:48,885 --> 00:52:53,640
But I've been thinking about
what you said, and I'm sorry.

862
00:53:00,897 --> 00:53:04,567
Welcome to Casa del Wild.
Take a load off.

863
00:53:04,651 --> 00:53:06,569
Hey, hey, wipe your feet.

864
00:53:11,658 --> 00:53:15,745
- Alex!
- Mi casa is su casa.

865
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:24,170
Very impressive.

866
00:53:24,253 --> 00:53:27,340
Hey, have a drink.
It's on the house.

867
00:53:29,092 --> 00:53:30,343
This is seawater.

868
00:53:31,427 --> 00:53:35,264
Oh, you don't swallow it. It's just
temporary till the plumbing's done.

869
00:53:35,348 --> 00:53:37,266
Hey, y'all look hungry.

870
00:53:38,017 --> 00:53:41,020
How would you like
some of nature's goodness?

871
00:53:42,105 --> 00:53:43,773
You have food?

872
00:53:43,856 --> 00:53:46,776
The Fun Side Special, coming up.

873
00:53:47,527 --> 00:53:49,529
Seaweed on a stick.

874
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:51,114
Seaweed?

875
00:53:51,531 --> 00:53:54,617
On a stick.
Don't love it till you try it.

876
00:54:02,458 --> 00:54:04,043
That's unbelievable.

877
00:54:05,461 --> 00:54:07,547
- So good.
- Well, thanks.

878
00:54:07,630 --> 00:54:10,466
It does kind of hit the spot,
doesn't it?

879
00:54:11,467 --> 00:54:14,721
Well, maybe it could
use a little lemon.

880
00:54:18,725 --> 00:54:22,979
No, it's great. It's really great.
Doesn't get any better than this.

881
00:54:23,062 --> 00:54:24,814
Oh, but it does.

882
00:54:25,481 --> 00:54:27,066
Check this out.

883
00:54:32,322 --> 00:54:36,326
Wow. Would you look at that.

884
00:54:36,409 --> 00:54:40,913
It's like billions
and billions of helicopters.

885
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:43,333
It's a shooting star.
Make a wish. Quick!

886
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:46,586
Ooh! How about a thick,
juicy steak?

887
00:54:46,669 --> 00:54:48,171
You know what, Alex?

888
00:54:48,254 --> 00:54:52,925
I promise you I'm going to find you
a steak tomorrow if it kills me.

889
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:54,344
Thanks, Marty.

890
00:54:54,344 --> 00:54:57,430
It is getting late.
I guess I'm going to...

891
00:54:57,513 --> 00:54:59,932
I think I'm going to
hit the sack too.

892
00:55:00,016 --> 00:55:01,851
Sweet dreams, everyone.

893
00:55:32,215 --> 00:55:33,549
Alex.

894
00:55:43,559 --> 00:55:45,311
What are you doing?

895
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:51,109
27, 28, 29, 30. Hmm 30.
Thirty black and only 29 white.

896
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,569
Looks like you're black
with white stripes after all.

897
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:55,154
Dilemma solved. Good night.

898
00:56:05,832 --> 00:56:09,419
You see, Maurice,
Mr. Alex was grooming his friend.

899
00:56:09,419 --> 00:56:12,922
He is clearly a tender,
loving thing.

900
00:56:12,922 --> 00:56:15,925
How can you have the
heebie-jeebies for Mr. Alex?

901
00:56:15,925 --> 00:56:19,595
Look at him.
He's so cute and plushy.

902
00:56:19,679 --> 00:56:22,265
I don't think he was
grooming him Julien.

903
00:56:22,265 --> 00:56:24,767
Look more like
he was tasting him to me.

904
00:56:24,851 --> 00:56:28,187
Suit yourself, no matter.
I don't care.

905
00:56:28,271 --> 00:56:32,442
Soon we will put my
excellent plan to action.

906
00:56:32,442 --> 00:56:35,069
All we have to do is wait

907
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:38,948
until they are deep in their sleep.

908
00:56:44,621 --> 00:56:47,540
How long is this going to take?!

909
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,401
Well, this sucks!

910
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:19,322
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

911
00:57:20,490 --> 00:57:22,992
Wake up, Mr. Alex.

912
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:25,411
Rise and shining.

913
00:57:25,495 --> 00:57:28,665
Wakey-waking, Mr. Alex!

914
00:57:28,748 --> 00:57:30,249
Wake up! Alex!

915
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,001
You suck your thumb?

916
00:57:35,004 --> 00:57:37,674
- Where are we?
- What the heck is going on?

917
00:57:37,674 --> 00:57:39,092
- Where's the beach?
- Take it easy.

918
00:57:39,092 --> 00:57:40,134
What is this?

919
00:57:40,009 --> 00:57:43,012
- Who built a forest?
- Don't be alarmed, giant freaks.

920
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:44,347
While you were asleep,

921
00:57:44,347 --> 00:57:48,518
we simply took you
to our little corner of heaven.

922
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:50,853
Welcome to Madagascar.

923
00:57:50,937 --> 00:57:53,523
- Mada-who-ah?
- What?

924
00:57:53,606 --> 00:57:55,942
No, not whooha. Ascar.

925
00:58:03,616 --> 00:58:05,285
Marty. It's...

926
00:58:05,368 --> 00:58:07,954
It's just like my mural
back at the zoo.

927
00:58:08,037 --> 00:58:12,208
Oh, no, fella, that is
the real deal right there.

928
00:58:12,208 --> 00:58:14,294
Look at that,
that's not a bad view.

929
00:58:14,377 --> 00:58:15,962
I mean, that's the thing
that you were...

930
00:58:15,962 --> 00:58:18,339
always looking at,
but it's actually there.

931
00:58:18,381 --> 00:58:20,091
I mean that's like
the real version of...

932
00:58:20,091 --> 00:58:21,801
Hey! How about once
around the park?

933
00:58:21,884 --> 00:58:23,177
Let's get our blood pumping,

934
00:58:23,177 --> 00:58:26,180
get those lungs breathing at all
this fresh air, who's with me?

935
00:58:26,222 --> 00:58:29,267
Ah, no. I really I don't
think I can. You're it!

936
00:58:29,392 --> 00:58:30,977
Hey! Want to play around?

937
00:58:33,229 --> 00:58:34,397
Got you there!

938
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,898
Come here!

939
00:58:36,232 --> 00:58:37,400
You're it.

940
00:58:37,483 --> 00:58:40,236
Hey, stop that!
Hey, you're crazy!

941
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:43,406
Okay, Marty, I'm it.

942
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:45,992
I'm it. I'm it. You win.

943
00:58:46,075 --> 00:58:48,578
Come on, Alex, get in the groove.

944
00:58:48,578 --> 00:58:50,496
I haven't eaten in two days.

945
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:53,750
My blood sugar's real low.
I just don't have the energy.

946
00:58:53,750 --> 00:58:55,084
I don't think that's your problem.

947
00:58:55,084 --> 00:58:58,421
First of all, that's not
how you run in the wild.

948
00:58:58,504 --> 00:59:00,381
Let's go man.
Put the rubber to the road!

949
00:59:00,381 --> 00:59:02,508
You just have
to let out that inner lion.

950
00:59:02,592 --> 00:59:06,012
- Now, who's the cat?
- Marty, I really don't...

951
00:59:06,095 --> 00:59:09,265
You are, that's who.
Come on! Here we go!

952
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:11,517
That's it. Now let's
build up some steam!

953
00:59:11,517 --> 00:59:12,727
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

954
00:59:12,727 --> 00:59:13,478
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

955
00:59:13,478 --> 00:59:14,228
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

956
00:59:14,228 --> 00:59:14,979
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

957
00:59:14,979 --> 00:59:15,730
- You're the cat.
- Who's the cat?

958
00:59:15,730 --> 00:59:18,316
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

959
00:59:18,316 --> 00:59:20,109
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

960
00:59:20,109 --> 00:59:21,694
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

961
00:59:21,694 --> 00:59:22,737
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?
Who's the cat? Who's the cat?

962
00:59:24,697 --> 00:59:26,449
I'm the cat!

963
00:59:32,288 --> 00:59:33,790
Surprise!

964
00:59:41,297 --> 00:59:42,799
You're it. You're it!

965
00:59:42,882 --> 00:59:45,134
Can't juke the cat.
Cat's too quick.

966
00:59:48,137 --> 00:59:53,476
I feel like a mile-high pastrami on rye
on the fly from the deli in the sky!

967
00:59:54,477 --> 00:59:57,480
- Let's go wild!
- Now you're talking!

968
01:00:04,654 --> 01:00:07,323
Man! I feel... different.

969
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:10,743
Noogie, noogie, noogie.
Noogie, noogie, noogie!

970
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:14,330
- Kind of charged up or something.
- Marty! Marty! Marty!

971
01:00:14,414 --> 01:00:17,250
- Like you said, baby, it's...
- Crackalacking.

972
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:21,754
- Ain't that right, Melman?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

973
01:00:24,424 --> 01:00:26,009
I'm in heaven.

974
01:00:26,092 --> 01:00:26,968
You see, Maurice,

975
01:00:26,968 --> 01:00:30,847
Alex is now our friend and
the fossas are nowhere to be seen.

976
01:00:31,097 --> 01:00:33,933
It could be said
that my plan is working

977
01:00:33,933 --> 01:00:37,353
in a very good working
kind of way.

978
01:00:37,437 --> 01:00:40,523
Alex. You got to try some of this.

979
01:00:42,191 --> 01:00:44,694
I feel good.
I feel like a king again.

980
01:00:45,528 --> 01:00:46,696
King?

981
01:00:47,447 --> 01:00:49,282
You should see his act.

982
01:00:49,365 --> 01:00:52,535
Come on, Alex, why don't you
show him some of your act.

983
01:00:52,619 --> 01:00:55,538
Oh. No, I really
don't think I could... Okay.

984
01:00:55,538 --> 01:00:58,875
Ladies and gentlemen.
Primates of all ages.

985
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:01,044
The wild proudly presents:

986
01:01:01,127 --> 01:01:02,545
The king.

987
01:01:02,629 --> 01:01:05,465
Alex the lion!

988
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:07,717
E flat, fellas.

989
01:01:17,143 --> 01:01:19,896
Yeah! The king is in the house!

990
01:01:19,979 --> 01:01:22,398
See, if he is the king,
then where is his crown?

991
01:01:22,398 --> 01:01:23,775
I've got a crown.

992
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:27,070
Got a very nice one.
And it's here on my head.

993
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:29,072
Look at it. Have I got it on?

994
01:01:35,328 --> 01:01:37,413
Do the roar, man. Do the roar.

995
01:01:42,502 --> 01:01:45,838
Wow. I've never heard
that one before.

996
01:01:45,922 --> 01:01:48,174
Yeah! Go wild, man! Come on!

997
01:01:49,676 --> 01:01:50,927
Break out the wave!

998
01:02:17,787 --> 01:02:19,956
Excuse me.

999
01:02:20,039 --> 01:02:22,292
You're biting my butt.

1000
01:02:24,627 --> 01:02:27,046
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1001
01:02:28,965 --> 01:02:31,050
- Alex, what did you do?
- You just bit me on the butt!

1002
01:02:31,134 --> 01:02:33,177
No. I didn't. Did I?

1003
01:02:33,177 --> 01:02:35,096
- You kind of did.
- He just bit me on the butt!

1004
01:02:35,138 --> 01:02:37,140
What the heck is wrong with you?

1005
01:02:38,891 --> 01:02:40,143
Why'd you bite me?

1006
01:02:40,226 --> 01:02:42,979
- Man, it's because you are his dinner.
- What?!

1007
01:02:43,062 --> 01:02:45,315
- Excuse me?
- That's dumb.

1008
01:02:45,398 --> 01:02:46,316
Come, come, Maurice.

1009
01:02:46,357 --> 01:02:49,485
What is a simple bite on the
buttocks among friends?

1010
01:02:49,986 --> 01:02:51,821
Here, give me a nibble.

1011
01:02:51,904 --> 01:02:55,575
The party is over, Julien.
Your brilliant plan has failed.

1012
01:02:55,658 --> 01:02:57,410
What are you talking about?

1013
01:02:57,493 --> 01:02:59,162
Your friend here is
what we call

1014
01:02:59,203 --> 01:03:02,415
a deluxe-model hunting
and eating machine.

1015
01:03:02,498 --> 01:03:04,417
And he eats steak...

1016
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,002
which is you.

1017
01:03:06,002 --> 01:03:10,256
- Get out of here.
- Okey-dokey, Maurice, I admit it.

1018
01:03:10,340 --> 01:03:12,175
The plan failed.

1019
01:03:12,175 --> 01:03:15,511
All is lost! We're all doomed.

1020
01:03:15,511 --> 01:03:20,350
The fossas will come back and
gobble us with their mouths because...

1021
01:03:20,433 --> 01:03:22,769
we are all steak.

1022
01:03:22,852 --> 01:03:24,687
I'm steak! Me, me, me!

1023
01:03:24,771 --> 01:03:27,023
Mr. Alex cannot stay here.

1024
01:03:27,106 --> 01:03:31,444
He belongs with his own kind
on the fossa side of the island.

1025
01:03:31,527 --> 01:03:33,363
By the power vested in me,

1026
01:03:33,446 --> 01:03:36,783
by the law of the jungle,
blah, blah, blah, blah...

1027
01:03:36,866 --> 01:03:38,034
Be gone!

1028
01:03:38,034 --> 01:03:40,870
What? Come on, do I look
like a steak to you?

1029
01:03:40,954 --> 01:03:42,205
Yeah!

1030
01:03:42,288 --> 01:03:45,208
See, I told you I don't
look like a... Wait. What you say?

1031
01:03:45,208 --> 01:03:47,627
Oh, yeah!

1032
01:03:49,128 --> 01:03:52,715
- He's going savage.
- Run for your lives.

1033
01:03:54,717 --> 01:03:56,386
Marty, run!

1034
01:04:13,987 --> 01:04:16,906
A bull's eye.
Excellent shot, Maurice.

1035
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,074
Thank you.

1036
01:04:23,496 --> 01:04:24,747
Marty?

1037
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:29,085
I'm so sorry, Marty.

1038
01:04:33,589 --> 01:04:36,342
What is wrong with me?

1039
01:04:36,426 --> 01:04:38,761
Ow.

1040
01:04:38,845 --> 01:04:40,596
Oh, no.

1041
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:42,348
What have I done?

1042
01:04:42,432 --> 01:04:45,518
It's true. I'm a monster.

1043
01:04:45,601 --> 01:04:47,603
I got to get out of here.

1044
01:06:59,152 --> 01:07:02,572
What have I done?
This is a nightmare.

1045
01:07:02,572 --> 01:07:04,324
And it's all my fault.

1046
01:07:04,407 --> 01:07:07,410
Now, because of me,
we've lost Alex.

1047
01:07:07,410 --> 01:07:09,078
Well, what are we going to do?

1048
01:07:09,162 --> 01:07:11,831
We're gonna find a way to help him.
That's what we're gonna do.

1049
01:07:11,914 --> 01:07:12,915
Oh, just okay.

1050
01:07:12,999 --> 01:07:15,752
- Come on, we are New Yorkers, right?
- Yeah.

1051
01:07:15,752 --> 01:07:18,087
- We're tough. We're gritty.
- Yeah.

1052
01:07:18,087 --> 01:07:19,672
- We're adaptable!
- Yeah!

1053
01:07:19,672 --> 01:07:22,842
And we are not going to lay down
like a bunch of Melmans.

1054
01:07:22,925 --> 01:07:25,428
No, we're not.

1055
01:07:25,428 --> 01:07:26,763
Oh. Gloria.

1056
01:07:26,763 --> 01:07:29,932
That was not me, okay?
That was the boat.

1057
01:07:30,099 --> 01:07:32,185
- The boat!
- The boat?

1058
01:07:32,268 --> 01:07:33,900
The boat's come back for us!

1059
01:07:33,901 --> 01:07:35,401
Come on, guys,
we got to flag it down.

1060
01:07:38,441 --> 01:07:39,108
There it is!

1061
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:41,444
- Hey, over here!
- Over here!

1062
01:07:41,444 --> 01:07:42,946
Over here! Yo!

1063
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:45,698
Melman, give me a lift.
Come on. Hurry up! Lift me up!

1064
01:07:45,782 --> 01:07:47,200
Help! Help! Help!

1065
01:07:47,283 --> 01:07:50,119
- Over here! Come on. Come on.
- Oh, my neck. My neck. You guys.

1066
01:07:50,119 --> 01:07:52,538
- Melman! Steady. This way!
- Over here! Over here!

1067
01:07:52,538 --> 01:07:53,581
You have no idea how much
this hurts.

1068
01:07:53,957 --> 01:07:55,792
Hey, boat! We're over here!

1069
01:07:58,044 --> 01:08:00,630
Look! It's turning!
It's coming back!

1070
01:08:00,630 --> 01:08:01,923
- It's coming back!
- Yes, this way!

1071
01:08:02,048 --> 01:08:04,550
Come on! Come on, baby!

1072
01:08:05,718 --> 01:08:07,387
Yes! You guys.

1073
01:08:07,470 --> 01:08:09,722
You guys flag down that boat.
I'll go get Alex.

1074
01:08:09,806 --> 01:08:11,724
Whoa! Hold on there.

1075
01:08:12,725 --> 01:08:15,144
You cannot go back there by yourself.

1076
01:08:15,144 --> 01:08:17,480
Aw, come on. I know Alex.

1077
01:08:17,563 --> 01:08:20,316
When he hears we're rescued,
he'll snap right out of it!

1078
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,819
The people are coming.
They can help us.

1079
01:08:22,902 --> 01:08:25,822
Melman's right. The people
will know what to do.

1080
01:08:25,905 --> 01:08:28,241
Now come on,
we gotta flag down that boat.

1081
01:08:46,592 --> 01:08:49,262
Now, this is more like it.

1082
01:08:49,345 --> 01:08:52,682
You?! Oh, ma...
Where are the people?

1083
01:08:52,765 --> 01:08:54,684
We killed them and ate their livers.

1084
01:08:56,769 --> 01:08:58,104
Gotcha, didn't I?

1085
01:08:58,187 --> 01:09:00,773
Just kiddin' doll,
the people are fine.

1086
01:09:01,441 --> 01:09:04,193
They're on a slow lifeboat to China.

1087
01:09:04,277 --> 01:09:06,613
Hey, I know you two.

1088
01:09:06,696 --> 01:09:11,117
Where's that psychotic lion
and our monochromatic friend?

1089
01:09:11,200 --> 01:09:15,204
Marty? He's righ... Where did he go?
He was right behind us.

1090
01:09:15,288 --> 01:09:18,791
He went back for Alex.
He's gonna get himself killed.

1091
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:22,045
Well, boys, our monochromatic
friend's in danger.

1092
01:09:22,128 --> 01:09:24,047
Looks like we have a job to do.

1093
01:09:24,130 --> 01:09:26,966
Captain's log: Embarking
into hostile environment.

1094
01:09:27,050 --> 01:09:30,345
Kowalski. We'll need to win the
hearts and the minds of the natives.

1095
01:09:30,428 --> 01:09:33,222
Rico. We'll need
special tactical equipment.

1096
01:09:33,306 --> 01:09:35,892
We're gonna face extreme peril.

1097
01:09:35,975 --> 01:09:38,311
Private probably won't survive.

1098
01:09:45,151 --> 01:09:47,987
Alex! Come out, Alex!

1099
01:09:48,071 --> 01:09:50,406
The boat's here! We can go home!

1100
01:09:56,913 --> 01:10:02,001
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1101
01:10:02,168 --> 01:10:06,756
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

1102
01:10:07,423 --> 01:10:10,259
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1103
01:10:10,343 --> 01:10:14,097
Alex! Alex! Alex!

1104
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,515
Alex!

1105
01:10:17,517 --> 01:10:18,518
Alex!

1106
01:10:20,436 --> 01:10:21,938
Marty?

1107
01:10:22,021 --> 01:10:24,565
Snap out of it, Alex.
The boat came back.

1108
01:10:24,565 --> 01:10:25,692
We can get out of here.

1109
01:10:25,858 --> 01:10:27,610
We can go back to civilization,

1110
01:10:27,610 --> 01:10:29,904
and everything will be,
just like it used to be!

1111
01:10:29,946 --> 01:10:31,447
Stay back.

1112
01:10:32,448 --> 01:10:33,533
Please.

1113
01:10:34,701 --> 01:10:36,619
I'm a monster.

1114
01:10:36,703 --> 01:10:40,039
Alex, you're no monster.
You're my friend.

1115
01:10:40,123 --> 01:10:43,209
We're a team.
You and me, remember?

1116
01:10:51,134 --> 01:10:53,219
I don't want to hurt you.

1117
01:11:24,584 --> 01:11:26,502
Alex.

1118
01:11:26,586 --> 01:11:28,630
I ain't leaving without you.

1119
01:11:44,437 --> 01:11:47,690
Alex? I'm thinking of a song.

1120
01:11:47,774 --> 01:11:51,778
It's a wonderful song.
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

1121
01:11:53,112 --> 01:11:56,950
<i>Start spreadin' the news</i>

1122
01:11:58,117 --> 01:12:01,871
<i>I'm leaving today</i>

1123
01:12:02,872 --> 01:12:06,542
<i>We are a great big part of it</i>

1124
01:12:09,295 --> 01:12:13,216
Come on, you know the words.
Two little words.

1125
01:12:13,299 --> 01:12:15,969
Please don't make me
sing this by myself.

1126
01:12:16,094 --> 01:12:19,263
You really don't want
to hear me sing this by myself.

1127
01:12:22,892 --> 01:12:26,562
Uh, Alex? Could you
come out here for a minute?

1128
01:12:26,604 --> 01:12:30,066
Hey, Alex, a little help.

1129
01:12:30,984 --> 01:12:32,318
Help me!

1130
01:12:33,403 --> 01:12:35,571
Alex! Help!

1131
01:12:39,659 --> 01:12:43,788
Help me! Anybody, help me!
Somebody!

1132
01:12:44,580 --> 01:12:46,916
Help!

1133
01:12:58,177 --> 01:12:59,762
- Melman?
- That's right, baby.

1134
01:13:01,347 --> 01:13:02,682
Run!

1135
01:13:05,018 --> 01:13:06,936
- What's the plan?
- This is the plan.

1136
01:13:07,020 --> 01:13:08,605
- Fossa hungry.
- Fossa eat.

1137
01:13:08,730 --> 01:13:10,940
This is the plan?

1138
01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:12,275
Fossa halt.

1139
01:13:14,986 --> 01:13:17,363
Fossa ooh.

1140
01:13:18,156 --> 01:13:20,033
Fossa aaahh.

1141
01:13:21,326 --> 01:13:23,703
Fossa ooh.

1142
01:13:25,288 --> 01:13:27,624
Fossa aaahh.

1143
01:13:28,541 --> 01:13:30,293
Come and get it.

1144
01:13:30,376 --> 01:13:31,377
Fossa.

1145
01:13:44,057 --> 01:13:45,975
- Take that.
- Fossa ow!

1146
01:13:46,059 --> 01:13:48,478
There's too many of them, Skipper.

1147
01:13:48,561 --> 01:13:51,648
It's been a real pleasure
serving with you boys.

1148
01:13:57,403 --> 01:13:59,739
Alex?

1149
01:13:59,864 --> 01:14:01,240
That's my kill.

1150
01:14:01,324 --> 01:14:02,659
Mine.

1151
01:14:08,414 --> 01:14:10,083
Alex hungry.

1152
01:14:11,417 --> 01:14:12,961
Alex eat.

1153
01:14:29,852 --> 01:14:31,187
It's showtime.

1154
01:14:33,273 --> 01:14:35,024
Thanks for not giving up on me Marty.

1155
01:14:36,109 --> 01:14:38,194
Man, you almost gave me
a heart attack.

1156
01:14:38,194 --> 01:14:40,029
You can't just come up
here and sneak up on me.

1157
01:14:40,029 --> 01:14:43,032
Just because you're a lion...
Let go off me. Let go off me.

1158
01:14:43,157 --> 01:14:46,536
We're getting out of here.
Guys, just go with me on this.

1159
01:14:46,619 --> 01:14:48,705
Like I said, it's showtime.

1160
01:14:50,123 --> 01:14:51,374
Mine.

1161
01:14:52,709 --> 01:14:54,085
My kill.

1162
01:14:55,670 --> 01:14:57,171
They're all mine.

1163
01:14:59,257 --> 01:15:01,384
It's the king of the beasts! Oh, no!

1164
01:15:01,384 --> 01:15:03,553
- Please don't eat me Mr. Lion.
- He's big and scary!

1165
01:15:03,636 --> 01:15:07,056
Fear me! Savagery
beyond comprehension.

1166
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:11,060
- I am far too young to die!
- You're a monster! A monster, I say!

1167
01:15:11,144 --> 01:15:13,646
- And, you!
- Me?

1168
01:15:17,734 --> 01:15:22,488
Oh, you want some of this? Ooh!
You better run for your lives.

1169
01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:26,075
- Somebody call a cop!
- He's psychotic!

1170
01:15:33,082 --> 01:15:35,835
This is my territory.
Understand?

1171
01:15:37,003 --> 01:15:41,049
I never, ever want
to see you on my turf again.

1172
01:15:47,805 --> 01:15:48,765
Boo.

1173
01:15:51,684 --> 01:15:53,519
Yeah! You the cat!

1174
01:15:55,063 --> 01:15:56,439
Got my boy back!

1175
01:15:58,024 --> 01:15:59,359
I did it!

1176
01:15:59,442 --> 01:16:00,610
Give me some love!

1177
01:16:00,610 --> 01:16:03,446
The plan worked!
The plan worked! I'm very clever!

1178
01:16:03,529 --> 01:16:06,866
I'm the one, baby! Come on.
Time to robot.

1179
01:16:06,950 --> 01:16:09,160
I am very clever king.

1180
01:16:09,869 --> 01:16:11,454
I am super genius.

1181
01:16:11,537 --> 01:16:14,123
I am robot king of the monkey things.

1182
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,794
- Compute, compute.
- So, what's for lunch?

1183
01:16:20,129 --> 01:16:22,131
- Close those eyes.
- Why do I have to close my eyes?

1184
01:16:22,173 --> 01:16:23,633
- Do it.
- Yeah. They're closed.

1185
01:16:23,716 --> 01:16:25,551
- Tighter.
- Yes, sir.

1186
01:16:25,635 --> 01:16:27,303
- No peeking.
- All right. They're closed.

1187
01:16:27,428 --> 01:16:29,138
Rico.

1188
01:16:33,059 --> 01:16:34,143
Hai.

1189
01:16:35,770 --> 01:16:36,980
Open that hatch.

1190
01:16:37,897 --> 01:16:40,441
Fire in the hole. Now chew.

1191
01:16:41,234 --> 01:16:43,820
Chew like you mean it.
Savor it.

1192
01:16:44,737 --> 01:16:46,489
- And?
- Well?

1193
01:16:46,572 --> 01:16:48,408
Pretty good, right?

1194
01:16:48,491 --> 01:16:50,868
There's always Plan B.

1195
01:16:52,578 --> 01:16:54,497
This is better than steak.

1196
01:16:54,539 --> 01:16:56,332
I love it. I love it!

1197
01:16:56,416 --> 01:16:58,334
The kitty loves the fishy.

1198
01:17:01,170 --> 01:17:03,506
Well, I propose a toast.

1199
01:17:03,589 --> 01:17:06,509
Now, he may be a pain
in the butt at times...

1200
01:17:06,551 --> 01:17:08,678
And trust me, I know.

1201
01:17:08,761 --> 01:17:11,514
But this cat proved
to me without a doubt

1202
01:17:11,597 --> 01:17:14,017
that his heart
is bigger than his stomach.

1203
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,893
- To Alex.
- To Alex.

1204
01:17:23,192 --> 01:17:24,736
Enough! Stop it!

1205
01:17:26,529 --> 01:17:29,699
Well. What do you guys think?
Should we head back to New York?

1206
01:17:29,782 --> 01:17:32,201
I don't know Marty.
I mean, this is your dream.

1207
01:17:32,285 --> 01:17:34,287
You sure you want to leave?

1208
01:17:34,370 --> 01:17:36,372
I don't care where we are.

1209
01:17:36,456 --> 01:17:39,709
As long as we're together,
it doesn't matter to me.

1210
01:17:39,792 --> 01:17:41,419
Well, in that case...

1211
01:17:41,461 --> 01:17:44,339
Yo. Rico.
I'll take 300 orders...

1212
01:17:44,339 --> 01:17:45,256
- To go.
- Hai.

1213
01:17:45,256 --> 01:17:46,090
Yes, yes.

1214
01:17:46,132 --> 01:17:49,844
But before you leave,
I have an announcement to make.

1215
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:52,930
So shut up, everyone, please.
Thank you.

1216
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:57,560
After much deep and profound
brain things inside my head,

1217
01:17:57,602 --> 01:17:59,979
I have decided to thank you

1218
01:17:59,979 --> 01:18:02,774
for bringing peace to our home.

1219
01:18:02,815 --> 01:18:04,442
And to make you feel good,

1220
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:07,403
I'm going to give you
this lovely parting gift.

1221
01:18:07,487 --> 01:18:10,323
No, I couldn't. Really,
I can't take your crown.

1222
01:18:10,323 --> 01:18:12,825
That's okay,
I've got a bigger crown.

1223
01:18:12,909 --> 01:18:14,243
It's got a gecko on it.

1224
01:18:14,285 --> 01:18:17,455
Look at him shake.
Go, Stevie, go!

1225
01:18:18,498 --> 01:18:21,209
- Bye, little fuzzbuckets!
- Thanks for everything!

1226
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,919
- So long!
- OK. Bye-bye, now.

1227
01:18:23,002 --> 01:18:24,587
- Arrivederci.
- Bye-bye.

1228
01:18:24,671 --> 01:18:27,340
- Toodle-oo!
- See you later, crocodile.

1229
01:18:27,382 --> 01:18:30,468
Maurice, my arm is tired.
Wave it for me.

1230
01:18:31,344 --> 01:18:33,596
Faster, you naughty little monkey.

1231
01:18:33,638 --> 01:18:35,348
You know, by the time we get
back to New York,

1232
01:18:35,390 --> 01:18:36,724
it's gonna be the
middle of the winter.

1233
01:18:36,808 --> 01:18:39,102
So I was just thinking,
why rush?

1234
01:18:39,185 --> 01:18:42,188
Maybe we could make a few..
side stops along the way.

1235
01:18:42,188 --> 01:18:44,607
- Maybe Paris.
- You just read my mind.

1236
01:18:44,691 --> 01:18:47,151
- I was thinking Spain.
- Run with the bulls.

1237
01:18:47,151 --> 01:18:49,946
- What about Fiji?
- Canada. Can we?

1238
01:18:50,029 --> 01:18:51,864
Cheap meds.

1239
01:18:51,948 --> 01:18:54,909
You know. I wouldn't even mind
coming back here for a visit sometime.

1240
01:18:54,951 --> 01:18:57,036
- Yeah. I could do that.
- You could say that again.

1241
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:00,123
Skipper?

1242
01:19:00,164 --> 01:19:03,793
Don't you think we should tell
them that the boat's out of gas?

1243
01:19:03,835 --> 01:19:04,961
Nah.

1244
01:19:05,044 --> 01:19:08,965
Just smile and wave, boys.
Smile and wave.

1245
01:19:09,305 --> 01:20:09,239
