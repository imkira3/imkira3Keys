1
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:01,445
- Mr. Mills, how are you?
- I'm fine.

2
00:02:01,487 --> 00:02:02,617
- How are you?
- Fine.

3
00:02:02,653 --> 00:02:05,737
- I suppose you wanna see it again?
- If you don't mind.

4
00:02:05,774 --> 00:02:08,075
- You know where it is.
- Oh, yeah.

5
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:11,694
If I charged you a dollar every time
you came to examine the machine...

6
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:14,861
...you'd probably own it.
It's the one all the pros use.

7
00:02:14,903 --> 00:02:17,570
Mariah Carey. Beyoncé. Gwen Stefani.

8
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:19,991
Really? Who's Beyoncé?

9
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:22,944
Just kidding. I'll take it.

10
00:02:51,651 --> 00:02:54,155
Excuse me, sir.
The adult party's in the front.

11
00:02:54,192 --> 00:02:56,900
- I'm Kim's father.
- Excuse me, I work for her father.

12
00:02:56,937 --> 00:03:00,150
- Her real father.
- It's okay, Cyril. I got it.

13
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:02,733
- Hello, Bryan.
- Lenore.

14
00:03:03,982 --> 00:03:06,170
I just wanted to give Kim her present.

15
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:08,322
We're letting the kids
have their space.

16
00:03:08,358 --> 00:03:11,446
- Put it with the others.
- I wanna give it to her myself.

17
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,815
- Still having trouble following the rules.
- Oh, come on, Lennie.

18
00:03:14,852 --> 00:03:18,024
- I've asked you not to call me that.
- Excuse me. Lenore.

19
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,875
- Dad!
- Oh, my darling.

20
00:03:19,912 --> 00:03:21,654
- Hi.
- Hello, my sweet.

21
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:24,106
- Happy birthday.
- I was telling your father...

22
00:03:24,142 --> 00:03:26,856
...how we arranged the presents.
- Here.

23
00:03:26,893 --> 00:03:28,778
It's bad manners to open the one...

24
00:03:28,815 --> 00:03:31,189
...and not the others.
- Go on. Open it.

25
00:03:33,148 --> 00:03:35,444
- Cool.
- A karaoke machine?

26
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,939
- Well, I figured she wants to be a singer.
- When she was 12, Bryan.

27
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:41,564
- We've moved on.
- Thank you, Daddy.

28
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,361
My pleasure.

29
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:46,605
- I still wanna be a singer. Don't tell Mom.
- You got it.

30
00:03:46,641 --> 00:03:48,527
Here. One for the book.

31
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:51,854
- We have a professional photographer.
- Big smile, sweetie.

32
00:03:51,938 --> 00:03:54,438
That's my girl.

33
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:04,068
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

34
00:04:04,104 --> 00:04:06,062
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

35
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:07,812
Oh, my... Stuart!

36
00:04:07,895 --> 00:04:10,270
Stuart, I love you! I love you!
I love you!

37
00:04:10,307 --> 00:04:12,520
Happy birthday, sweetie.

38
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:26,810
- Oh, Stuart, you're impossible.
- I know.

39
00:04:26,847 --> 00:04:28,935
- Hey, Bryan.
- Stuart.

40
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,478
- She's not a little girl anymore, huh?
- I guess not.

41
00:04:32,514 --> 00:04:35,816
- Will you join us for lunch?
- No, thanks.

42
00:04:35,852 --> 00:04:39,310
I just wanted to be here
to wish her a happy birthday.

43
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:42,519
- Good to see you, Bryan.
- You too.

44
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,391
Thanks.

45
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,181
- Hey.
- Hey.

46
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:39,014
You forgot.

47
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,639
Come on in.

48
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,103
It's not like I didn't call to remind you.
Third Saturday in May?

49
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,805
- Red meat, red wine? Sound familiar?
- He probably had a lot on his mind.

50
00:05:47,842 --> 00:05:51,055
Yeah, the busy life of a retiree.
Every day a new adventure.

51
00:05:51,091 --> 00:05:54,219
What does a retiree do, anyway?
Take naps? Play golf?

52
00:05:54,255 --> 00:05:57,346
- Hit on rich widows?
- That takes care of the morning.

53
00:05:57,383 --> 00:06:00,012
Yeah, well, come on, guys.
You know why I'm here.

54
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:01,726
Yeah, how's that going?

55
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:03,763
Okay. We had her birthday today.

56
00:06:03,799 --> 00:06:05,762
Can you believe my Kimmy's 17?

57
00:06:06,387 --> 00:06:08,679
Seventeen?

58
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:12,387
- To Kim.
- Lennie still got a hard-on for you?

59
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:15,262
She's not Lennie anymore.
She's Lenore.

60
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,975
Oh, she's still got a hard-on.

61
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:19,516
- And the husband?
- The same. Perfect.

62
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:23,345
- Dig deep enough, there's always shit.
- We can dig if you want us to dig.

63
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:25,803
What, you think he hasn't
done it already?

64
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,141
Thank you, Bernie.

65
00:06:27,177 --> 00:06:30,260
- How's Kimmy?
- Good. She's good.

66
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:32,516
Yeah? She sleep over yet?

67
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:35,516
Well, let's say we're working on it.

68
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:38,968
She appreciate the fact
that you've given up your life...

69
00:06:39,005 --> 00:06:41,843
...in order to be closer to her?

70
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:44,051
What a life, huh?

71
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,843
Hey, remember Beirut
after the chief disappeared?

72
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,465
Bry was in deep with that
crazy sheik from Hezbollah?

73
00:06:49,501 --> 00:06:52,050
The guy said he'd get us inside
then disappeared.

74
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:54,098
We're scrambling to get the hell out...

75
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:56,509
...before we get taken down
and where are you?

76
00:06:56,546 --> 00:06:58,672
I promised never to miss her birthday.

77
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,879
Yeah, that went down well
at Langley...

78
00:07:00,915 --> 00:07:03,013
...when they found out
you flew the coop...

79
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:06,050
...to attend your child's birthday
9000 miles away.

80
00:07:06,087 --> 00:07:08,096
Where did you say
your next posting was?

81
00:07:08,133 --> 00:07:11,050
The Arctic Circle spying on penguins,
I believe it was.

82
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:12,846
No, penguins live in Antarctica.

83
00:07:12,882 --> 00:07:15,471
Actually, it was Alaska.
What's your point, Sam?

84
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:20,382
My point is we have an open space.
Say the word, it's yours.

85
00:07:21,882 --> 00:07:24,132
Who likes theirs rare?

86
00:07:24,382 --> 00:07:25,637
- Guys.
- See you, Bryan.

87
00:07:25,674 --> 00:07:28,013
- Good night, guys.
- See you, Bry.

88
00:07:28,049 --> 00:07:30,303
Hey, look, look, look.
All kidding aside...

89
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:33,631
...it's a great thing trying to make up
for lost time with Kimmy.

90
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:35,566
But tomorrow's job? Right here.

91
00:07:35,602 --> 00:07:37,428
Four hours' work, 2500 bucks...

92
00:07:37,465 --> 00:07:40,631
...just for taking some pop diva
to and from her concert.

93
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,260
- We're one short.
- A singer?

94
00:07:42,297 --> 00:07:45,422
I don't know if you'd call her a singer.
More like a cash cow.

95
00:07:45,459 --> 00:07:48,548
Twenty million records sold already
and she's not even 25.

96
00:07:48,584 --> 00:07:49,969
Job's a piece of cake.

97
00:07:50,005 --> 00:07:53,338
We get her there and back.
Inside, they've got their own people.

98
00:07:53,374 --> 00:07:55,127
- Okay.
- Okay. Okay?

99
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:56,880
- Yeah.
- Like that's it?

100
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,213
Yeah.

101
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:02,505
- It'll be perfect. Just like old times.
- Better. No one gets killed.

102
00:08:02,754 --> 00:08:05,759
- Tomorrow. Good night, guys.
- See you.

103
00:08:05,796 --> 00:08:09,629
- Get in the back, Wendy.
- I always get in the back.

104
00:08:36,502 --> 00:08:39,211
Ma'am, if you don't mind,
I suggest you keep moving.

105
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:41,793
My mother is ma'am,
if you don't mind.

106
00:08:44,876 --> 00:08:48,126
- Come on, it's time now. Let's go.
- Okay.

107
00:08:49,043 --> 00:08:52,043
Bernie, Casey, you're out here.
Bry, you're in the room.

108
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:54,126
Okay.

109
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,626
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

110
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,959
Thank you for coming.

111
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,999
Wow, it was beautiful.

112
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:18,833
Thanks. What did you say
your name was again?

113
00:09:18,869 --> 00:09:20,546
Mills. Bryan Mills.

114
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,749
- Nice to meet you, Bryan Mills.
- You too.

115
00:09:24,207 --> 00:09:27,498
- You're on. Come on, let's go now.
- Okay, guys.

116
00:09:27,535 --> 00:09:28,670
Excuse me, miss.

117
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:33,665
I've a daughter who wants to be a singer
and was wondering if you had any tips.

118
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:36,086
Yeah, I do.

119
00:09:36,122 --> 00:09:38,789
Tell her to pick another career.

120
00:09:41,165 --> 00:09:43,586
I got one.
We're waiting on an air strike...

121
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:46,663
and we're waiting
and then my satellite phone rings.

122
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,835
- Who is it?
- Hello?

123
00:09:47,872 --> 00:09:49,794
- The guy we're to terminate.
- Honey.

124
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:53,372
- He'd like to know if we want some tea.
- Sorry, guys, it's Kim.

125
00:09:54,788 --> 00:09:56,543
The noise?

126
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,163
I'm at a concert.

127
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:02,002
You know this song? Yeah?

128
00:10:02,038 --> 00:10:05,371
Yep, that's her.
No, no, no, I'm not attending.

129
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:06,959
I'm... I'm not attending.

130
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:09,787
I'm helping some friends out
with security.

131
00:10:09,824 --> 00:10:11,959
Well, of course I met her.

132
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:13,828
Who do you think's guarding her?

133
00:10:13,865 --> 00:10:16,222
I'm glad you're impressed.

134
00:10:16,258 --> 00:10:19,126
Hey, I'm happy you called.

135
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:21,995
I'm happy you called. What?

136
00:10:22,032 --> 00:10:24,791
Lunch? Tomorrow?

137
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:28,286
Sure, sure. I know the place.

138
00:10:28,322 --> 00:10:31,036
Twelve-thirty it is.

139
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:33,161
I'll see you then.

140
00:10:33,203 --> 00:10:35,202
- Here he is. And?
- What happened?

141
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:37,166
- She wants to have lunch.
- Okay.

142
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:39,577
- Just the two of us.
- All right. Fantastic.

143
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:41,827
See? There's progress. That's great.

144
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:58,408
Who left that gate open?
Bry, get her out of here. Take the lead.

145
00:10:58,445 --> 00:10:59,992
- Move!
- Go, go!

146
00:11:01,909 --> 00:11:03,409
More security here now!

147
00:11:03,446 --> 00:11:05,533
That's it. Move.

148
00:11:11,658 --> 00:11:14,033
Casey!

149
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:17,455
Bernie, stand by, stand by.

150
00:11:17,491 --> 00:11:20,074
- Go, go, go.
- Watch your head.

151
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:27,324
Here, take this. The sugar will
take the edge off the shock.

152
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,073
Come on, come on, drink some more.

153
00:11:38,782 --> 00:11:41,072
It's okay. It's okay. You're safe.

154
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,531
You're safe now.

155
00:11:50,488 --> 00:11:51,827
Bernie.

156
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:54,364
Casey. Rambo.

157
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:57,572
Seriously, Bry,
you should think about coming with us.

158
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:00,321
You've got the edge.
There's more of this to be had.

159
00:12:00,357 --> 00:12:02,326
- She's going to college next year?
- Yep.

160
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:05,947
- You're gonna lose her.
- That gives me a year to find her.

161
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:09,529
Mr. Mills, she'd like to see you.

162
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:17,653
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

163
00:12:19,862 --> 00:12:22,195
So your daughter
wants to be a singer?

164
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:25,159
Yep, since she was 5.

165
00:12:25,195 --> 00:12:27,117
It's not what everyone thinks it is.

166
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:32,819
Once the glam wears off, it's just
a lot of hotel rooms, lots of airports.

167
00:12:32,861 --> 00:12:34,486
It's what she wants.

168
00:12:38,028 --> 00:12:40,277
The first number is Gio,
my vocal coach.

169
00:12:40,314 --> 00:12:42,490
If he says she can sing, she can sing.

170
00:12:42,526 --> 00:12:45,319
He'll give her coaching she needs,
the fee is on me.

171
00:12:45,355 --> 00:12:47,366
The second number is my manager.

172
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:50,485
If Gio clears her,
he'll make sure she gets a shot.

173
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:56,818
- Thank you.
- No, Mr. Mills, thank you.

174
00:13:12,649 --> 00:13:15,316
- There she is.
- Dad.

175
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,274
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey.

176
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:22,321
- Hi.
- Hi.

177
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:23,862
Don't look so excited.

178
00:13:23,899 --> 00:13:27,858
I was just surprised.
I thought it was just gonna be Kim and I.

179
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:29,649
I asked Mom to come.

180
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,065
One raspberry-banana milkshake,
extra cherries, just the way you like it.

181
00:13:35,101 --> 00:13:36,654
- Thanks.
- Lennie... Lenore.

182
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,857
- Would you like something?
- I'm fine, thanks.

183
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:41,898
So?

184
00:13:41,981 --> 00:13:43,528
So, Dad, guess what.

185
00:13:43,565 --> 00:13:45,689
- You know my friend Amanda?
- Yep.

186
00:13:46,064 --> 00:13:49,273
Her cousins asked us to spend vacation
with them in Paris.

187
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:50,445
How cool is that?

188
00:13:50,481 --> 00:13:53,153
- Why do you want to go to Paris?
- Dad. Hello?

189
00:13:53,189 --> 00:13:56,647
The Louvre, the Impressionist museum,
the Picasso Museum.

190
00:13:56,689 --> 00:13:58,652
I didn't know you were so into art.

191
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:01,860
Are you kidding? I've been to the MOMA,
like, a hundred times.

192
00:14:01,896 --> 00:14:07,146
Amanda went last summer, she came
back, she could practically speak French.

193
00:14:09,063 --> 00:14:10,652
And because you're under 18...

194
00:14:10,688 --> 00:14:14,021
...you need my permission
to leave the country?

195
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:17,651
Dad, please. I really, really wanna go.

196
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:20,688
They've got this
sick apartment overlooking the river.

197
00:14:20,724 --> 00:14:23,275
- Just you and Amanda?
- And her cousins.

198
00:14:23,312 --> 00:14:27,061
Don't make a big deal out of this, Bryan.
Just sign the paper.

199
00:14:31,894 --> 00:14:34,186
- What?
- I'm not comfortable with this.

200
00:14:34,223 --> 00:14:36,394
- Dad.
- I know the world, sweetie.

201
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:39,436
- Dad, please.
- A 17-year-old should not travel alone.

202
00:14:39,472 --> 00:14:41,811
- I'm not gonna be alone.
- Two 17-year-olds.

203
00:14:41,848 --> 00:14:44,310
Amanda's 19.

204
00:14:49,393 --> 00:14:52,066
How about this?
How about if I go along?

205
00:14:52,102 --> 00:14:55,102
You won't know I'm there.
I'm very good at being invisible.

206
00:14:55,138 --> 00:14:58,559
As you so amply demonstrated
for most of her life.

207
00:14:58,596 --> 00:15:00,643
Just sign the paper, Bryan.

208
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:04,689
I'll think about it.

209
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:07,392
Everyone at this table
knows what that means.

210
00:15:07,892 --> 00:15:10,851
Hey, Kimmy, there's something else.

211
00:15:11,142 --> 00:15:14,142
- I don't want anything else.
- Kim.

212
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:22,058
- I don't get you.
- What?

213
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,203
You sacrificed our marriage
in the service of the country.

214
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,189
You made a mess of your life
in service of your country.

215
00:15:28,226 --> 00:15:31,204
Can't you sacrifice a little
this time for your daughter?

216
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:34,182
- I would sacrifice anything for her.
- What's your problem?

217
00:15:34,218 --> 00:15:38,095
I'm not comfortable
putting my daughter at risk.

218
00:15:38,131 --> 00:15:41,973
Putting our daughter at risk
by going to Paris?

219
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:44,598
You're pathetic.

220
00:15:59,472 --> 00:16:02,764
- She's coming.
- Thanks.

221
00:16:05,513 --> 00:16:06,852
Three conditions.

222
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:09,684
The address and phone number
of where you're staying.

223
00:16:09,721 --> 00:16:12,810
You move, I wanna know where
and with whom you'll be staying.

224
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:16,596
Call me when you land. Call me
every night before you go to sleep.

225
00:16:16,632 --> 00:16:18,476
It's international. My number is in.

226
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,804
- Okay, awesome.
- Kimmy, you're not focused.

227
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,267
- I am.
- What did I say?

228
00:16:22,304 --> 00:16:25,803
You said call you when I land,
every night before I go to sleep...

229
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,966
...your phone's international,
the number's programmed in.

230
00:16:29,003 --> 00:16:32,095
Okay, one last thing.
I get to take you to the airport.

231
00:16:32,131 --> 00:16:34,095
Okay.

232
00:16:34,512 --> 00:16:36,474
- There you go.
- Yes.

233
00:16:36,511 --> 00:16:40,010
Thank you, Daddy.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

234
00:16:40,047 --> 00:16:42,219
Mom!

235
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:45,303
I love you, Dad.

236
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:49,511
Mom, he signed it, he signed it.
I'm gonna go call Amanda!

237
00:16:52,843 --> 00:16:55,641
Wouldn't it have been easier
to sign the first time?

238
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:59,802
Wouldn't it have been easier
if you and I had talked about it first?

239
00:17:03,384 --> 00:17:06,676
Certain areas in Paris you should avoid.
I've written them down.

240
00:17:06,713 --> 00:17:08,014
- Dad.
- Come on, take it.

241
00:17:08,051 --> 00:17:12,008
We're gonna be spending 90 percent
of our time in museums. Don't worry.

242
00:17:12,045 --> 00:17:15,175
That's like telling water
not to be wet, sweetie.

243
00:17:15,212 --> 00:17:17,092
Mom says
your job made you paranoid.

244
00:17:17,129 --> 00:17:19,300
Well, my job made me aware.

245
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:24,175
I used to ask Mom what your job was
that you were away all the time.

246
00:17:24,211 --> 00:17:26,638
And she would tell me to ask you.

247
00:17:26,675 --> 00:17:30,508
Whenever I did see you,
I was afraid to ask.

248
00:17:30,544 --> 00:17:32,715
Yeah? Why?

249
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:36,382
I don't know. Maybe because...

250
00:17:36,507 --> 00:17:39,215
...I was afraid to find out.

251
00:17:40,549 --> 00:17:43,215
Like, maybe it was something
I wouldn't like.

252
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,715
I worked for the government.
You knew that.

253
00:17:46,752 --> 00:17:51,137
So you were like a spy, right?

254
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:55,089
- What happens if I push this button?
- Don't touch that button.

255
00:17:55,339 --> 00:18:00,839
Well, no, I was a...
I was a preventer, actually.

256
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,171
- A preventer?
- Yeah.

257
00:18:03,296 --> 00:18:05,135
What did you prevent?

258
00:18:05,172 --> 00:18:07,589
Bad things from happening.

259
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:11,398
So it was a good job?

260
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:15,171
Yes. Yep, it was.

261
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:19,170
Do you miss it?

262
00:18:19,212 --> 00:18:21,004
I missed you more.

263
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,378
- Kim!
- Dad, there's Amanda.

264
00:18:38,415 --> 00:18:40,336
Go ahead. I'll get the bags.

265
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,417
- Jimmy'll give you a hand with those.
- I can manage.

266
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:06,006
Lenore.

267
00:19:06,042 --> 00:19:09,376
Do you know about this?
She's not just going to Paris.

268
00:19:09,668 --> 00:19:11,339
- I know.
- She lied to me.

269
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:14,001
Yes, because she can't be honest
with you.

270
00:19:14,209 --> 00:19:15,917
Why? What are you talking about?

271
00:19:15,953 --> 00:19:17,792
Your rules and conditions.

272
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:19,172
What is this?

273
00:19:19,209 --> 00:19:22,130
It's U2's European tour dates.

274
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:24,297
She's following a rock band
around Europe?

275
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:28,208
All kids do. Stuart got her tickets,
arranged her to stay in the best hotels.

276
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:31,662
Best hotels. You know,
you live in your little bubble here...

277
00:19:31,699 --> 00:19:35,082
...behind your wall, with your maids
and chauffeurs and servants.

278
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:36,712
No idea what the world is like.

279
00:19:36,749 --> 00:19:41,041
Yes, and neither will she
unless she goes out and experiences it.

280
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:44,795
Don't tell me I don't know the world.

281
00:19:44,832 --> 00:19:48,915
For five years I waited for a phone call
that didn't come for weeks at a time.

282
00:19:48,951 --> 00:19:52,498
For a knock on the door
telling me there'd be no calls anymore.

283
00:19:56,205 --> 00:20:00,373
Listen, I know you moved here to build
some sort of relationship with Kimmy.

284
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:03,335
But you're not gonna do that
by smothering her.

285
00:20:03,372 --> 00:20:07,371
Let her live, or I promise,
I promise you'll lose her.

286
00:20:13,913 --> 00:20:15,413
Girls.

287
00:20:20,579 --> 00:20:22,205
Kim!

288
00:20:27,703 --> 00:20:29,204
I love you.

289
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:33,412
Let's go. Come on.

290
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,000
I'll teach you the French words
I know.

291
00:20:47,036 --> 00:20:50,077
- Which may not be that much, but...
- Okay. Yeah, right.

292
00:20:54,577 --> 00:20:56,749
Three. Okay, now take one...

293
00:20:56,785 --> 00:20:59,243
Need some help?
One with the two of you?

294
00:20:59,285 --> 00:21:01,373
Yes, please.

295
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,952
- Okay.
- He's really cute.

296
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:06,535
Okay. Yeah, great. Very nice.

297
00:21:06,576 --> 00:21:08,075
Where are you from?

298
00:21:08,112 --> 00:21:10,284
California.

299
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:17,242
No. I'm Peter.

300
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:24,539
- This is Kim.
- Hi.

301
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,908
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

302
00:21:25,944 --> 00:21:27,497
Hey.

303
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,491
You're going into Paris?

304
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,283
You know, taxis here
are so damned expensive.

305
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,580
Want to share?

306
00:21:34,616 --> 00:21:36,574
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay, perfect.

307
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,907
Thanks.

<i>Please enter the flight number.</i>

310
00:21:48,365 --> 00:21:51,906
<i>Flight 288 arrived
in Paris Charles de Gaulle...</i>

311
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:55,907
<i>...at 8 a. m. local time.</i>

312
00:21:56,656 --> 00:21:58,203
Yeah.

313
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:00,869
Oh, are you serious?

314
00:22:00,905 --> 00:22:03,364
- Oh, my God.
- Nice address.

315
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,869
Oh, yeah, thanks.

316
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:09,197
It's my cousins', but they're in Madrid,
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

317
00:22:09,234 --> 00:22:10,910
How cool is that?

318
00:22:10,946 --> 00:22:13,738
- I didn't know that.
- It's no biggie.

319
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,905
Well, I have to be going.

320
00:22:15,947 --> 00:22:17,821
- Nice to meet you.
- Oh, okay.

321
00:22:17,858 --> 00:22:19,405
- You too.
- Bye.

322
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:21,571
Hey.

323
00:22:21,987 --> 00:22:24,821
There is a party tonight at school.
Want to come?

324
00:22:24,863 --> 00:22:26,738
- Sure. Yeah.
- We don't even know him.

325
00:22:26,774 --> 00:22:29,076
What is there to know? He's hot.

326
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:31,403
- I come pick you up around 9?
- Okay, yeah.

327
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,575
Okay, great. Your apartment?

328
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:37,362
- It's the whole fifth floor. Hoffmann.
- Okay. See you tonight. Bye.

329
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,487
Bye.

330
00:22:47,403 --> 00:22:48,986
Yeah.

331
00:22:49,444 --> 00:22:50,616
Fifth floor.

332
00:22:50,653 --> 00:22:53,819
Two girls around 18.

333
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,824
Oh, my God.

334
00:22:57,861 --> 00:23:01,152
- How sick is this?
- Are you kidding me? It's great.

335
00:23:01,194 --> 00:23:04,110
I just wish you would've told me
they weren't gonna be here.

336
00:23:04,146 --> 00:23:07,027
- What's the difference?
- I told my dad they'd be here.

337
00:23:07,063 --> 00:23:09,484
You told your dad you were
going to museums too.

338
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,818
Oh, come on. He's not gonna know.

339
00:23:12,567 --> 00:23:14,484
- I'm gonna sleep with him.
- Who?

340
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,484
- Peter.
- You just met him.

341
00:23:16,526 --> 00:23:19,379
I hear French guys are amazing in bed.

342
00:23:19,416 --> 00:23:22,233
- Maybe he has a friend, huh?
- No.

343
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:23,572
- No.
- Oh, come on.

344
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:27,900
You gotta lose it sometime.
Might as well be in Paris.

345
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,566
Hey!

346
00:23:52,857 --> 00:23:55,189
- Amanda, where's the bathroom?
- What?

347
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:56,815
I have to pee!

348
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:24,854
- Hello?
- It's me. Has Kim called you?

349
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:29,688
Bryan, she's 17. She's in Paris.
Give her some space.

350
00:24:29,724 --> 00:24:32,226
<i>She'll call. Take a sleeping pill.</i>

351
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,728
Have a drink or something. Good night.

352
00:24:35,186 --> 00:24:37,520
Good night.

353
00:24:53,102 --> 00:24:54,686
Hi, Daddy.

354
00:24:55,185 --> 00:24:57,435
Kim.

355
00:24:58,519 --> 00:25:01,227
What did I say?
You were supposed to call me.

356
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:02,357
I'm sorry.

357
00:25:02,393 --> 00:25:04,810
<i>I thought something was wrong
with the phone.</i>

358
00:25:04,852 --> 00:25:07,705
- No. It was such a rush at the airport.
- All right.

359
00:25:07,742 --> 00:25:10,560
Well, if I'd had the number
where you were staying...

360
00:25:10,596 --> 00:25:12,392
<i>...I would've just called there.</i>

361
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:13,564
<i>What's the number?</i>

362
00:25:13,601 --> 00:25:16,355
<i>- I don't have it.
- Kimmy, come on.</i>

363
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:19,351
<i>This is one of the conditions.
Let me talk to the cousins.</i>

364
00:25:19,387 --> 00:25:21,148
<i>I'll get it from them.</i>

365
00:25:21,184 --> 00:25:25,350
Dad, they're in Spain.
I didn't know. I swear.

366
00:25:25,387 --> 00:25:27,558
To Spain?

367
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:32,309
Kim, is there anything else
you want to tell me?

368
00:25:35,183 --> 00:25:37,557
Kimmy.

369
00:25:41,058 --> 00:25:44,224
- There's someone here.
- The cousins are back?

370
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,432
No.

371
00:25:46,766 --> 00:25:49,682
- Oh, my God. They got Amanda.
- What?

372
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:52,057
<i>What are you talking about? Kimmy?</i>

373
00:25:52,099 --> 00:25:53,848
<i>- Dad.
- Kim.</i>

374
00:25:54,931 --> 00:25:57,394
<i>- Kim.
- Dad. They took her.</i>

375
00:25:57,431 --> 00:25:59,889
<i>- They took her.
- All right, listen to me.</i>

376
00:25:59,926 --> 00:26:01,478
Oh, God.

377
00:26:01,515 --> 00:26:04,306
- Did you meet anyone on the plane?
- No.

378
00:26:04,342 --> 00:26:06,845
- In the airport?
- No. Yes, Peter.

379
00:26:06,881 --> 00:26:09,347
<i>- Peter? Peter who?
- I don't know.</i>

380
00:26:09,383 --> 00:26:10,644
<i>- An American?
- No.</i>

381
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,889
Did he know where you were staying?

382
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:14,888
He took a cab with us.

383
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,555
Dad, they're coming.

384
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:23,394
<i>- Please, I'm scared.
- I know you are.</i>

385
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,929
Stay focused, Kimmy.
You have to hold it together.

386
00:26:25,966 --> 00:26:27,643
How many people are there?

387
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,679
- Three, four. I don't know.
- Where are you?

388
00:26:31,804 --> 00:26:34,700
- I'm in the bathroom.
- Go to the next bedroom.

389
00:26:34,737 --> 00:26:37,596
Get under the bed.
Tell me when you're there.

390
00:26:45,594 --> 00:26:49,427
- I'm here.
- Now, the next part is very important.

391
00:26:52,261 --> 00:26:56,115
They are going to take you.
Kim, stay focused, baby. This is key.

392
00:26:56,151 --> 00:26:59,968
You will have five, maybe ten seconds.
Very important seconds.

393
00:27:00,005 --> 00:27:02,599
<i>Leave the phone on the floor.
Concentrate.</i>

394
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:06,843
Shout out everything you see about them.
Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.

395
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,718
Anything you see. You understand?

396
00:27:12,968 --> 00:27:14,802
They're there. I can hear them.

397
00:27:14,838 --> 00:27:17,092
<i>Remember, concentrate.</i>

398
00:27:29,675 --> 00:27:32,008
Put the phone closer so I can hear.

399
00:27:56,674 --> 00:28:00,257
They're leaving. I think they're...

400
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:09,047
<i>Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.</i>

401
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:32,170
I don't know who you are.

402
00:28:33,045 --> 00:28:35,301
I don't know what you want.

403
00:28:35,337 --> 00:28:39,378
If you are looking for a ransom,
I can tell you, I don't have money.

404
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:43,961
But what I do have
are a very particular set of skills.

405
00:28:43,998 --> 00:28:46,925
Skills I've acquired
over a very long career.

406
00:28:46,962 --> 00:28:51,336
Skills that make me a nightmare
for people like you.

407
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:54,877
If you let my daughter go now,
that'll be the end of it.

408
00:28:54,914 --> 00:28:58,920
I will not look for you.
I will not pursue you.

409
00:28:58,956 --> 00:29:02,877
But if you don't, I will look for you.

410
00:29:02,914 --> 00:29:05,799
I will find you...

411
00:29:05,835 --> 00:29:08,627
...and I will kill you.

412
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,418
<i>Good luck.</i>

413
00:29:25,125 --> 00:29:27,422
Sam, it's me. I need a favor.

414
00:29:27,459 --> 00:29:32,042
I'm gonna download something.
I need it analyzed. Right now.

415
00:29:32,333 --> 00:29:34,042
- She's been taken.
- What?

416
00:29:34,083 --> 00:29:36,547
- Any enemies overseas?
- Why would I have enemies?

417
00:29:36,583 --> 00:29:39,672
You do business overseas
through multiple shell corporations.

418
00:29:39,708 --> 00:29:43,458
You were involved in an oil deal with
a bunch of Russians that went south.

419
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:46,454
- How do you know that?
- I was not gonna let my daughter...

420
00:29:46,491 --> 00:29:49,379
...live with someone without knowing
everything about them.

421
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:52,749
- I have a few resources...
- Now is not the time for dick measuring.

422
00:29:52,785 --> 00:29:55,081
- Anyone looking to hurt you?
- Not that I know.

423
00:29:55,118 --> 00:29:57,170
- Which room's Kim's?
- What happened?

424
00:29:57,207 --> 00:30:00,874
I got a call from her. There were people
in the apartment. She was taken.

425
00:30:00,915 --> 00:30:02,415
- Oh, God.
- Which one?

426
00:30:02,451 --> 00:30:04,540
That one.

427
00:30:08,248 --> 00:30:10,170
Is there something I should be doing?

428
00:30:10,206 --> 00:30:13,331
You have a lease agreement
with NetJet through your company.

429
00:30:13,367 --> 00:30:15,331
I do.

430
00:30:15,373 --> 00:30:17,372
- Get me a plane to Paris.
- For when?

431
00:30:17,408 --> 00:30:18,669
An hour ago.

432
00:30:18,705 --> 00:30:22,580
- I'm gonna make the call. You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm okay.

433
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:34,704
Would you please
get her back to me, Bryan?

434
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:36,620
First I have to find her.

435
00:30:40,412 --> 00:30:43,167
Sam, what have you got?

436
00:30:43,203 --> 00:30:44,542
<i>They're speaking Albanian.</i>

437
00:30:44,579 --> 00:30:48,203
Based on their accents and dialects,
they must be from Tropoja.

438
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:50,167
<i>The place is ground zero
for scummers.</i>

439
00:30:50,203 --> 00:30:52,912
<i>Even the Russians
give these guys a wide berth.</i>

440
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,390
The one you spoke to,
his name is Marko.

441
00:30:55,427 --> 00:30:57,702
We have information
that a mobster boss...

442
00:30:57,744 --> 00:31:01,041
...by the name of Marko Hoxha
moved to Paris about six months ago.

443
00:31:01,078 --> 00:31:07,036
<i>If he's the one, he's a big fish.
The tattoo, by the way, is a group ID.</i>

444
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:10,410
<i>- Am I on speaker or are you by yourself?
- Lenore is here.</i>

445
00:31:10,447 --> 00:31:12,928
<i>- Hey, Lennie.
- Hello, Sam.</i>

446
00:31:12,965 --> 00:31:15,410
She needs to hear it, Sam.

447
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:20,368
The specialty of the groups coming out
of this area is trafficking in women.

448
00:31:23,535 --> 00:31:25,831
- Keep going.
- Okay.

449
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:30,450
Their previous m. o. was to offer women
from emerging East European countries...

450
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:35,218
<i>...like Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria,
jobs in the West as maids and nannies.</i>

451
00:31:35,254 --> 00:31:39,949
Once smuggled in, they'd addict them
to drugs and turn them into prostitutes.

452
00:31:40,908 --> 00:31:43,997
Lately, however, they've decided
that it's more economical...

453
00:31:44,033 --> 00:31:49,074
...just to kidnap traveling young women.
Saves on transportation costs.

454
00:31:49,110 --> 00:31:51,616
Oh, my little baby.

455
00:31:51,652 --> 00:31:53,371
What else?

456
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:56,511
Based on the way these groups operate,
our analyst says...

457
00:31:56,548 --> 00:31:59,615
...you have a 96-hour window
from the time she was grabbed.

458
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:02,240
- To what?
- To never finding her.

459
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:04,990
No, no, no.

460
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:07,698
<i>Daddy!</i>

461
00:32:07,906 --> 00:32:11,823
<i>Mustache. Six feet.
Tattoo on right hand, moon and star.</i>

462
00:32:11,859 --> 00:32:13,948
<i>Da...</i>

463
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,739
<i>Good luck.</i>

464
00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:27,363
<i>Good luck.</i>

465
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,529
<i>Good luck.</i>

466
00:32:31,696 --> 00:32:33,405
<i>Good luck.</i>

467
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:14,022
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

468
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:17,939
<i>Dad, they got Amanda.</i>

469
00:34:28,564 --> 00:34:30,106
<i>Oh, God.</i>

470
00:34:30,355 --> 00:34:34,146
<i>Dad, they got her.</i>

471
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:37,735
<i>They took her.</i>

472
00:34:37,771 --> 00:34:40,937
<i>Go to the next bedroom.
Get under the bed.</i>

473
00:34:40,974 --> 00:34:44,103
<i>- Tell me when you're there.
- I'm here.</i>

474
00:34:49,646 --> 00:34:52,650
<i>Stay focused, baby.
Leave the phone on the floor.</i>

475
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:55,316
<i>Concentrate. Shout out
everything you see about them.</i>

476
00:34:55,353 --> 00:34:59,395
<i>Hair color, eye color, tall, short, scars.
Anything you see. You understand?</i>

477
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,853
<i>They're there. I can hear them.
Remember, concentrate.</i>

478
00:35:15,601 --> 00:35:18,935
<i>They're leaving. Daddy!</i>

479
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,143
<i>Dad!</i>

480
00:35:23,601 --> 00:35:27,226
Beard. Six feet.
Tattoo right hand, moon and star.

481
00:35:27,262 --> 00:35:29,309
Dad!

482
00:37:10,552 --> 00:37:11,807
- Hi.
- Hi.

483
00:37:11,844 --> 00:37:13,594
- I'm Peter.
- I'm Ingrid.

484
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,279
- On holidays?
- Yes.

485
00:37:15,315 --> 00:37:16,890
- Me too.
- Cool.

486
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:19,593
Cabs here are so damned expensive.
Want to share?

487
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:22,385
- Sure. Why not?
- Great.

488
00:37:24,052 --> 00:37:26,593
- Excuse me.
- Hey.

489
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,467
- Hey.
- Drive.

490
00:37:32,593 --> 00:37:35,718
- The two American girls from yesterday?
- I don't know.

491
00:37:35,926 --> 00:37:40,550
The next rib drives into your lungs.
The two American girls, where are they?

492
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,875
- Just like the old days.
- Would you have it any other way?

493
00:39:44,911 --> 00:39:46,464
Between you and me? No.

494
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:50,000
But now that I sit behind a desk,
the world looks different.

495
00:39:50,037 --> 00:39:52,791
- You mean, looks boring.
- I mean different.

496
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:56,999
Okay, a little boring. But is being retired
any more interesting?

497
00:39:57,036 --> 00:40:00,505
It wasn't. Until my daughter
disappeared in Paris yesterday.

498
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:04,665
She and her friend were marked by a
spotter at the airport. Albanians took her.

499
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,457
- How do you know this?
- I'm retired, not dead.

500
00:40:07,499 --> 00:40:10,249
And I assume you don't want
to go to the police.

501
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:12,962
I was told I have 96 hours.
That was 16 hours ago.

502
00:40:12,998 --> 00:40:17,415
- Okay, first, we should find the spotter.
- I found him, he's dead.

503
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:22,206
You found him that way?

504
00:40:24,331 --> 00:40:27,914
Bryan, you cannot just run around
tearing down Paris...

505
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,211
I'll tear down the Eiffel Tower
if I have to.

506
00:40:30,248 --> 00:40:33,247
- Don't forget who you're talking to.
- I'm talking to a friend.

507
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:38,160
You are. But please remember,
your friend has a desk now.

508
00:40:38,197 --> 00:40:41,997
"Deputy director, Internal Security".
Very impressive.

509
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,168
The Albanians?

510
00:40:44,205 --> 00:40:47,204
They showed up from the East,
six, seven years ago.

511
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,930
Fifteen, twenty of them.
Now there are hundreds.

512
00:40:49,967 --> 00:40:52,620
We don't even know how many.
And dangerous.

513
00:40:52,657 --> 00:40:55,501
So I heard. Where do I find them?

514
00:40:55,537 --> 00:41:02,287
The best place to start is Porte de Clichy.
Bryan, try not to make a mess.

515
00:41:06,341 --> 00:41:08,765
I need an agent to follow somebody.

516
00:41:23,822 --> 00:41:29,115
Little Red Riding Hood said to the wolf,
"Grand-ma! What big arms you have"!

517
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:32,324
- And the wolf replied...
- Jean Claude, it's your assistant.

518
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,823
Yes?

519
00:41:38,824 --> 00:41:41,866
He went to the Interim branch
and rented a car.

520
00:41:41,908 --> 00:41:44,617
- That's all?
- Yes, nothing else happening.

521
00:41:44,659 --> 00:41:47,323
With him it doesn't take long,
don't be fooled.

522
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:07,866
- Gregor Milocivic?
- Yes. Yes, I am Gregor.

523
00:42:07,902 --> 00:42:10,657
I'm Mr. Smith. Get in.

524
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,370
Here is my résumé.

525
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:19,406
The employment agency said
we would be doing translations.

526
00:42:19,442 --> 00:42:22,453
Yes. Albanian to English.
You do speak Albanian?

527
00:42:22,490 --> 00:42:25,781
Albanian, Serbian, Croatian.
I was a teacher in primary school...

528
00:42:25,817 --> 00:42:28,739
...before the war began in Pristina...
- What's your rate?

529
00:42:28,776 --> 00:42:30,119
My rate?

530
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:33,489
It is 25 per hour for the first 3 hours
and then it goes up...

531
00:42:33,525 --> 00:42:37,780
Okay. Now, here's for 10 hours.
Wait here.

532
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:42,071
Mr. Smith, I do not understand.
What is the job exactly?

533
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:44,905
Right now the job is to wait here.

534
00:42:52,446 --> 00:42:54,034
Good evening.

535
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:58,487
- Hi. Looking for a date?
- I love your dress. Is that silk?

536
00:42:58,524 --> 00:43:00,629
I don't know.
You want to know the prices?

537
00:43:00,666 --> 00:43:02,700
Just the way it falls, it must be silk.

538
00:43:02,737 --> 00:43:06,237
How it compliments
the natural curves of your body.

539
00:43:06,274 --> 00:43:08,337
The rate is 40 euros for the standard.

540
00:43:08,374 --> 00:43:10,366
Standard? Could you be more specific?

541
00:43:10,402 --> 00:43:13,236
Back home, the standard covers
a range of possibilities.

542
00:43:13,278 --> 00:43:15,742
Like kissing,
you know, closed lips, open lips.

543
00:43:15,778 --> 00:43:18,944
- If you're not buying, piss off.
- I didn't say I wasn't buying.

544
00:43:18,981 --> 00:43:21,235
I like to get comfortable
before I purchase.

545
00:43:21,277 --> 00:43:23,240
Like this karaoke machine I bought.

546
00:43:23,277 --> 00:43:27,074
I must have read that manual
from cover to cover so many times.

547
00:43:27,111 --> 00:43:30,735
I don't give a shit. You're gonna
get me in trouble if you don't buy.

548
00:43:30,777 --> 00:43:33,109
- Trouble? Really? With who?
- Piss off.

549
00:43:33,146 --> 00:43:35,907
Okay, okay. Listen, I'm sorry.

550
00:43:35,943 --> 00:43:39,734
If I want a package deal,
do I get a discount?

551
00:43:39,776 --> 00:43:43,567
- You cost me two now.
- My name's Bryan.

552
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:47,484
- Oh, God. You better leave.
- I thought we were negotiating.

553
00:43:47,984 --> 00:43:49,864
Anton, I swear, it's not my fault.

554
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,650
- I told him...
- Why are you bothering the girl?

555
00:43:52,686 --> 00:43:55,364
- None of your business.
- She is my business.

556
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,255
And if you're not spending money,
you're costing money.

557
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:01,108
- I was negotiating.
- No negotiating. Price is the price.

558
00:44:01,144 --> 00:44:03,232
Now you owe me
for two that got away.

559
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:05,899
I don't owe you nothing.

560
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:10,274
- Fifty euros or I kick your ass.
- Sure, sure, okay.

561
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:12,565
Chill.

562
00:44:14,065 --> 00:44:18,441
Okay. Here's your 50.

563
00:44:18,732 --> 00:44:22,939
And another 50 for being an asshole.
Now get the hell out of here.

564
00:44:22,976 --> 00:44:26,106
If I see you again, I'll kill you.

565
00:44:31,606 --> 00:44:35,564
Mr. Smith, I do not know what kind of
job I'm supposed to do for you, but...

566
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,647
- You are to translate.
- Yes. But translate what?

567
00:44:38,689 --> 00:44:41,063
This.

568
00:44:47,813 --> 00:44:49,772
Translate.

569
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,938
- They're talking about you.
- What about me?

570
00:44:52,974 --> 00:44:55,859
- They're not saying nice things.
- Be specific.

571
00:44:55,896 --> 00:44:59,854
They're saying... Excuse me, Mr. Smith.
- what an asshole you are.

572
00:45:00,979 --> 00:45:03,770
Please, if you can explain to me
why we're doing this...

573
00:45:03,806 --> 00:45:05,607
Just translate.

574
00:45:05,644 --> 00:45:08,602
One of them says,
the sausage gave him heartburn.

575
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:09,936
Keep going.

576
00:45:09,978 --> 00:45:14,601
The other one is suggesting something
his grandmother used to give him.

577
00:45:14,638 --> 00:45:18,560
- Do you really want to hear all this?
- Every word.

578
00:45:19,227 --> 00:45:23,435
Now they're talking about football.
The game between Lazio and Marseille.

579
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:25,439
And they lost money on the betting.

580
00:45:25,476 --> 00:45:30,226
- Perhaps if I knew the purpose...
- You're better off not knowing.

581
00:45:30,263 --> 00:45:32,535
Is it still football?

582
00:45:32,571 --> 00:45:34,773
One is on the phone.

583
00:45:34,809 --> 00:45:37,230
He has to do a job
at the construction site.

584
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:40,475
Something about fresh merchandise
giving problems.

585
00:45:40,512 --> 00:45:42,975
Mr. Smith,
I do not understand any of this.

586
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:46,433
You're not supposed to. Goodbye.

587
00:45:47,141 --> 00:45:51,475
I asked for an English-Albanian
dictionary, did you bring one?

588
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:54,933
Thank you.

589
00:46:20,890 --> 00:46:22,946
- It's all squared away.
- Really?

590
00:46:24,654 --> 00:46:26,780
- Are you busy tonight?
- Of course.

591
00:47:32,509 --> 00:47:34,093
I love you.

592
00:47:49,257 --> 00:47:51,570
Where did you get this?

593
00:47:51,607 --> 00:47:53,846
Where did you get this?

594
00:47:53,883 --> 00:47:57,257
- I'm good.
- Who gave this to you?

595
00:47:58,049 --> 00:48:01,674
- Who...? Who gave this to you?
- I'm good.

596
00:48:03,674 --> 00:48:05,716
Hey.

597
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:31,296
Hey.

598
00:48:38,339 --> 00:48:40,964
Lets go!

599
00:48:45,296 --> 00:48:47,421
Come on.

600
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:32,070
I told you
he wouldn't stay quiet for long.

601
00:51:32,112 --> 00:51:33,237
Okay, so what're we gonna do now?

602
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:36,404
Now since he's started this mess,
it wont be long before it's finished!

603
00:51:54,073 --> 00:51:54,948
Oh shit!

604
00:52:27,448 --> 00:52:29,405
Monsieur Allen, how are you?

605
00:52:29,442 --> 00:52:31,364
Hello, Gilles. How's the wife?

606
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:33,036
Well, still in charge.

607
00:52:33,072 --> 00:52:36,322
- Been a long time since I've seen you.
- Way too long.

608
00:52:36,405 --> 00:52:38,988
- The usual accommodation?
- Plus one.

609
00:54:25,148 --> 00:54:26,361
Yes?

610
00:54:26,398 --> 00:54:29,397
<i>- We need to talk.
- I'm listening.</i>

611
00:54:31,148 --> 00:54:33,230
Well, can't you come
and meet me first?

612
00:54:33,272 --> 00:54:35,111
I can't see you. Where are you?

613
00:54:35,147 --> 00:54:38,314
I can see you and hear you very well.

614
00:54:38,647 --> 00:54:41,522
You can tell them,
to stop jogging now.

615
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:45,784
We'll get his cell phone signal
with your connection.

616
00:54:45,785 --> 00:54:49,270
Okay, we're good,
we got his cell phone signal.

617
00:54:49,271 --> 00:54:51,688
You didn't really think,
I was gonna come down there, did you?

618
00:54:51,689 --> 00:54:53,996
I didn't think you were gonna
make such a mess.

619
00:54:54,033 --> 00:54:56,234
I didn't have time to worry
about neatness.

620
00:54:56,271 --> 00:54:59,895
<i>- I know. You have 70 hours.
- Now I have 56.</i>

621
00:55:01,104 --> 00:55:02,901
No, now you have none.

622
00:55:02,937 --> 00:55:06,687
My chief wanted to arrest you,
I convinced him to send you home.

623
00:55:06,978 --> 00:55:11,942
<i>Air France 001 leaves today at 2.
First class.</i>

624
00:55:11,978 --> 00:55:15,477
Courtesy of the French government
for past services rendered.

625
00:55:18,269 --> 00:55:21,936
- And what about my daughter?
- I told you, I sit behind a desk now.

626
00:55:21,972 --> 00:55:25,399
<i>I take my orders from someone
who sits behind a bigger desk.</i>

627
00:55:25,435 --> 00:55:29,269
Come on, seven dead bodies,
three in hospital, a building destroyed.

628
00:55:29,305 --> 00:55:30,732
<i>Total chaos at the airport.</i>

629
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:34,267
He wanted your ass in chains.
It's the best I could do, I'm sorry.

630
00:55:34,304 --> 00:55:37,393
Sorry doesn't cut it, Jean-Claude.
Not this time.

631
00:55:40,602 --> 00:55:43,205
You can't beat the state, Bryan.
You know that.

632
00:55:43,242 --> 00:55:45,809
I'm not trying to.
I'm trying to save my daughter.

633
00:55:45,845 --> 00:55:47,976
It was a trailer, not a building.

634
00:56:27,806 --> 00:56:29,806
No, no, no. Leave it.

635
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:32,062
It's all right, it's fluids.

636
00:56:32,098 --> 00:56:34,597
And medication
to counteract the drugs.

637
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:36,680
It's all right.

638
00:56:39,264 --> 00:56:40,805
Where'd you get this?

639
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:43,722
Where did you get this jacket?

640
00:56:44,472 --> 00:56:46,138
Did you get it from her?

641
00:56:46,264 --> 00:56:48,763
Was it from this girl?

642
00:56:50,596 --> 00:56:52,394
I didn't steal it.

643
00:56:52,430 --> 00:56:56,596
- I was cold, she gave it to me.
- Where? Where did she give it to you?

644
00:56:57,762 --> 00:57:00,762
- In the house.
- What house?

645
00:57:01,429 --> 00:57:03,595
The house with the red door.

646
00:57:06,095 --> 00:57:07,928
Sorry.

647
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:16,178
He said it was a party.

648
00:57:16,761 --> 00:57:19,636
The girl who gave you this,
was she in the house?

649
00:57:24,302 --> 00:57:26,136
She was nice.

650
00:57:26,172 --> 00:57:28,135
I know.

651
00:57:28,635 --> 00:57:30,593
She's my daughter.

652
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,467
I need to find this house.
Do you know where it is?

653
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,301
Paradise.

654
00:58:01,925 --> 00:58:03,722
- Good morning.
- May I help you?

655
00:58:03,758 --> 00:58:06,383
- I'm here to see your boss.
- No boss.

656
00:58:11,424 --> 00:58:14,008
We're doing nothing wrong here.

657
00:58:14,924 --> 00:58:16,970
One button,
and 30 agents will be here...

658
00:58:17,007 --> 00:58:19,470
...before you have time
to scratch your balls.

659
00:58:19,506 --> 00:58:23,257
Stop jerking around before
I close you down for wasting my time.

660
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:30,464
Wait here.

661
00:58:42,755 --> 00:58:44,297
You have weapon?

662
00:58:44,339 --> 00:58:45,881
You're holding it.

663
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,920
Black, one sugar, please.

664
00:59:22,627 --> 00:59:24,252
What is it you want?

665
00:59:25,294 --> 00:59:27,050
I'm here to negotiate the rates.

666
00:59:27,086 --> 00:59:30,502
We already negotiated the rate
with Mr. Macon.

667
00:59:30,539 --> 00:59:33,835
Mr. Macon has moved
to another division.

668
00:59:33,871 --> 00:59:36,169
I'm here for the renegotiation.

669
00:59:39,501 --> 00:59:43,584
Unless you think I'm being unreasonable,
let me explain ourselves.

670
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:48,335
Nice coffee. We have you under
satellite surveillance, 24 hours a day.

671
00:59:48,371 --> 00:59:52,089
We hear everything you say,
we know everything you do.

672
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:55,792
Do you have any idea what it costs
just to change the angle...

673
00:59:55,828 --> 00:59:59,458
of the lens on a satellite
orbiting 200 miles above the Earth?

674
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:01,005
And those costs have gone up.

675
01:00:01,042 --> 01:00:04,749
Our costs go up, your costs go up.
It's only logical.

676
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:07,708
By the way,
which one of you is Marko?

677
01:00:07,745 --> 01:00:09,629
Why do you want to know?

678
01:00:09,666 --> 01:00:11,374
I was told Marko is in charge.

679
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:13,624
We are all Marko.

680
01:00:14,124 --> 01:00:15,879
Marko from Tropoja.

681
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,666
We are all from Tropoja.

682
01:00:19,957 --> 01:00:24,040
If that's the game you want to play,
the rate just went up 10 percent.

683
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:28,082
If you are trying to extort us because
we are immigrants, we know the law.

684
01:00:28,118 --> 01:00:30,765
I'm extorting you because
you are breaking the law.

685
01:00:30,802 --> 01:00:33,712
Which charge would you
like to be arrested for?

686
01:00:33,748 --> 01:00:36,560
Drugs, kidnapping, prostitution?
Take your pick.

687
01:00:36,596 --> 01:00:39,373
You come to this country,
take advantage of it...

688
01:00:39,414 --> 01:00:42,831
and think because we're tolerant,
we are weak and helpless.

689
01:00:42,867 --> 01:00:44,627
Your arrogance offends me.

690
01:00:44,663 --> 01:00:47,122
For that,
the rate went up 10 percent.

691
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:51,413
Now, do you want to get down
to business or to keep playing?

692
01:00:52,913 --> 01:00:54,876
- How much?
- Twenty percent.

693
01:00:54,912 --> 01:00:58,163
And you have my word,
it'll not go up for a year.

694
01:01:01,188 --> 01:01:02,188
Bring me the can.

695
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:10,246
How do you say "sugar"
in your language?

696
01:01:10,455 --> 01:01:12,329
- Zethe.
- Zethe.

697
01:01:23,078 --> 01:01:25,535
You've made a very good investment,
gentlemen.

698
01:01:25,572 --> 01:01:27,119
See you in a month.

699
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:31,577
Oh...

700
01:01:31,578 --> 01:01:35,244
A friend gave this to me.
It's Albanian. You mind translating it?

701
01:01:47,076 --> 01:01:49,164
Good luck.

702
01:01:49,201 --> 01:01:50,826
<i>- Good luck.
- Good luck.</i>

703
01:01:51,076 --> 01:01:53,409
<i>- Good luck. Good luck.
- Good luck.</i>

704
01:02:02,784 --> 01:02:04,950
You don't remember me.

705
01:02:05,283 --> 01:02:07,741
We spoke on the phone
two days ago.

706
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:12,742
I told you I would find you.

707
01:03:17,195 --> 01:03:18,737
Kim.

708
01:03:32,611 --> 01:03:34,694
Amanda.

709
01:04:10,108 --> 01:04:11,649
Wake up!

710
01:04:11,691 --> 01:04:13,941
I need you to be focused.

711
01:04:16,608 --> 01:04:18,982
Are you focused yet?

712
01:04:28,315 --> 01:04:29,982
Where is this girl?

713
01:04:30,107 --> 01:04:32,314
Where is she?

714
01:05:00,355 --> 01:05:04,318
You know, we used to outsource
this kind of thing.

715
01:05:04,354 --> 01:05:07,146
But what we found was,
the countries we outsourced to...

716
01:05:07,183 --> 01:05:10,184
had unreliable power grids.
Very Third World.

717
01:05:10,221 --> 01:05:13,150
Sometimes you'd turn on a switch,
power wouldn't come on for hours...

718
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:16,875
and then tempers would get short.
People would resort to...

719
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:19,894
things like pulling fingernails...
Acid drips on bare skin.

720
01:05:19,895 --> 01:05:22,513
The whole... exercise,
would become counterproductive.

721
01:05:22,514 --> 01:05:24,697
But here, the power's stable.

722
01:05:24,698 --> 01:05:26,810
Here, there's a nice even flow.

723
01:05:26,811 --> 01:05:30,602
Here, you can flip a switch
and the power stays on all day.

724
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:36,019
Where is she?

725
01:05:56,434 --> 01:06:00,850
Now, I don't have any more time
to waste, Marko from Tropoja.

726
01:06:00,887 --> 01:06:03,272
Give me what I need
or this switch'll stay on...

727
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:06,808
till they turn power off
for lack of payment on the bill.

728
01:06:07,558 --> 01:06:09,309
Where is my daughter?

729
01:06:09,350 --> 01:06:13,052
We don't keep virgins, we sell them.

730
01:06:13,053 --> 01:06:15,348
She was virgin, lot of money.

731
01:06:15,349 --> 01:06:18,016
You sold my daughter? You sold her?

732
01:06:18,017 --> 01:06:19,515
Huh?

733
01:06:19,516 --> 01:06:21,640
To who?

734
01:06:21,849 --> 01:06:23,974
I don't know.

735
01:06:25,932 --> 01:06:28,307
- What?
- Saint Clair.

736
01:06:28,343 --> 01:06:29,729
Saint Clair.

737
01:06:29,766 --> 01:06:32,848
Saint Clair? Saint Clair.
Is that a person, a place?

738
01:06:33,932 --> 01:06:37,139
Person. Patrice Saint-Clair.

739
01:06:37,176 --> 01:06:38,681
Patrice Saint-Clair.

740
01:06:39,348 --> 01:06:41,182
Where can I find him?

741
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,973
I don't know, I don't know.

742
01:06:44,264 --> 01:06:47,180
I don't know. I don't know.
I don't know.

743
01:06:47,217 --> 01:06:49,561
Please! I don't know!

744
01:06:49,597 --> 01:06:53,764
I don't know! No! Please! Please.

745
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,727
Please.

746
01:06:55,764 --> 01:06:57,846
Not that. Please.

747
01:06:57,883 --> 01:06:59,930
I believe you.

748
01:07:02,264 --> 01:07:05,055
But it's not gonna save you.

749
01:07:19,614 --> 01:07:20,736
I'm Home.

750
01:07:20,737 --> 01:07:22,452
- Papa!
- Papa!

751
01:07:22,453 --> 01:07:24,531
- Good evening my dear.
- Good evening, papa.

752
01:07:25,601 --> 01:07:27,676
The children should be in bed.

753
01:07:27,677 --> 01:07:30,053
Look who dropped by.

754
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:33,137
Bryan, what a pleasant surprise.

755
01:07:33,173 --> 01:07:34,308
Jean Claude.

756
01:07:34,344 --> 01:07:36,933
The children waited up for you.

757
01:07:36,969 --> 01:07:40,469
If you tuck them in, maybe we can eat
before everything gets cold.

758
01:07:40,505 --> 01:07:42,549
Bryan, will you do the honors?

759
01:07:42,586 --> 01:07:44,593
- Sure.
- I'll be just a minute.

760
01:07:44,742 --> 01:07:46,479
Children, bed time.

761
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,559
- Oh...
- Time to go to sleep, thank you.

762
01:07:54,814 --> 01:07:56,894
Good night.

763
01:08:14,634 --> 01:08:17,258
I was just telling Bryan
how nice it's been...

764
01:08:17,295 --> 01:08:19,257
since you left the old job
for the new one.

765
01:08:19,299 --> 01:08:22,049
Home every night for dinner,
get to see the kids more.

766
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:26,278
Yeah, must be nice coming home every night, seeing your kids, knowing they're safe.

767
01:08:26,279 --> 01:08:28,153
Bryan has been thinking
about relocating.

768
01:08:28,154 --> 01:08:30,054
- Oh, really?
- Yes...

769
01:08:30,090 --> 01:08:32,069
to Paris,
he's been visiting houses.

770
01:08:32,106 --> 01:08:34,466
- White or dark meat?
- Dark, please.

771
01:08:34,502 --> 01:08:36,137
Find anything interesting?

772
01:08:36,173 --> 01:08:40,256
As a matter of fact, I did, over at
the 10th arrondissement on Rue Paradis.

773
01:08:40,673 --> 01:08:43,423
People there know someone,
that works in your office, I think.

774
01:08:43,459 --> 01:08:45,512
A Mr. Macon. Do you know him?

775
01:08:45,548 --> 01:08:47,928
Oh, Henry. I call him Mr. Nervous.

776
01:08:47,964 --> 01:08:51,839
Always seems like he's about to
have a problem. Carrots?

777
01:08:51,875 --> 01:08:54,006
I got to the bottom of it,
Jean Claude.

778
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:55,673
I know everything.

779
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,672
I hope you're not involved
in this shit.

780
01:08:59,505 --> 01:09:02,546
- What shit?
- This is not the time or place, Bryan.

781
01:09:02,583 --> 01:09:05,130
- Are you involved?
- Involved in what?

782
01:09:05,297 --> 01:09:06,926
What are you two talking about?

783
01:09:06,963 --> 01:09:10,712
- Are you?
- My salary is X, my expenses are Y.

784
01:09:10,749 --> 01:09:12,926
As long as my family is provided for...

785
01:09:12,962 --> 01:09:15,713
I do not care,
where the difference comes from.

786
01:09:15,749 --> 01:09:17,759
That is my entire involvement.

787
01:09:17,795 --> 01:09:19,926
- What about my family?
- I told you...

788
01:09:19,962 --> 01:09:22,545
I would help
as long as it didn't cause trouble.

789
01:09:22,581 --> 01:09:24,405
Who is Patrice Saint Clair?

790
01:09:24,406 --> 01:09:27,795
I don't know, I don't care.
I am driving you to the airport.

791
01:09:27,831 --> 01:09:29,399
Jean Claude.

792
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,536
Quiet, Isabel.
Shut up!

793
01:09:30,537 --> 01:09:32,294
Let's get going. Dinner is over.

794
01:09:32,336 --> 01:09:34,336
- I'm not finished yet.
- Yes, you are.

795
01:09:34,373 --> 01:09:37,712
- No!
- No, I'm not.

796
01:09:41,960 --> 01:09:45,335
That's what happens when you sit
behind a desk. You forget things.

797
01:09:45,372 --> 01:09:48,293
Like the weight in the hand of a gun
that's loaded and one that's not.

798
01:09:49,918 --> 01:09:51,543
Isabelle!
You shot her cold.

799
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:53,798
It's a flesh wound.

800
01:09:53,835 --> 01:09:56,835
But if you don't get me what I need,
the last thing you'll see...

801
01:09:56,871 --> 01:09:59,834
before I make your children orphans,
is the bullet I put between her eyes.

802
01:09:59,871 --> 01:10:03,417
Now, Patrice Saint Clair.

803
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,880
You could've made this
less painful...

804
01:10:16,881 --> 01:10:18,708
if you had been more concerned
about my daughter...

805
01:10:18,709 --> 01:10:20,827
and less concerned
about your god-damn desk.

806
01:10:20,828 --> 01:10:23,624
Please apologize
to your wife for me.

807
01:11:28,328 --> 01:11:31,369
- Can I help you?
- Yes, I'm here to see Mr. Saint Clair.

808
01:11:31,406 --> 01:11:33,411
Your name, please.

809
01:11:36,911 --> 01:11:38,994
I'm sorry,
your name is not on the list.

810
01:11:39,031 --> 01:11:41,036
Oh, please check again.

811
01:11:43,619 --> 01:11:45,827
Inside.

812
01:12:32,908 --> 01:12:34,657
May I help you, sir?

813
01:12:39,782 --> 01:12:42,782
- Your champagne.
- Yeah, I will take it.

814
01:12:52,073 --> 01:12:55,822
<i>I have 50,000... 50,000.</i>

815
01:12:57,114 --> 01:12:59,655
<i>50,000.</i>

816
01:13:00,697 --> 01:13:04,446
<i>One hundred, 100,000.</i>

817
01:13:05,780 --> 01:13:09,446
<i>One hundred, 150.</i>

818
01:13:10,071 --> 01:13:11,696
<i>I have 150.</i>

819
01:13:11,863 --> 01:13:14,530
Your champagne, sir.

820
01:13:14,779 --> 01:13:17,654
<i>Two, I have two, 250.</i>

821
01:13:17,691 --> 01:13:18,825
May I serve?

822
01:13:18,862 --> 01:13:20,737
<i>- Please.
- I have 250.</i>

823
01:13:22,071 --> 01:13:24,279
<i>Two-fifty.</i>

824
01:13:24,363 --> 01:13:27,904
<i>Sold for 250,000.</i>

825
01:13:35,789 --> 01:13:40,540
If you want me to bid?
There is one more left.

826
01:13:40,582 --> 01:13:42,623
We'll see her in a moment.

827
01:13:45,445 --> 01:13:47,907
<i>The last item.</i>

828
01:13:47,944 --> 01:13:50,777
<i>As usual,
we save the best for last.</i>

829
01:13:50,813 --> 01:13:53,110
<i>Speaks English, some French.</i>

830
01:13:53,147 --> 01:13:55,069
<i>Certified pure.</i>

831
01:14:04,485 --> 01:14:06,027
- Sorry.
- Get out.

832
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:10,358
<i>The bidding will begin at 100,000.</i>

833
01:14:13,317 --> 01:14:15,942
<i>One hundred.</i>

834
01:14:25,358 --> 01:14:27,321
<i>One hundred thousand.</i>

835
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:29,691
- I said...
- I heard what you said.

836
01:14:29,728 --> 01:14:31,196
Buy her.

837
01:14:31,232 --> 01:14:32,816
<i>I have 100.</i>

838
01:14:34,066 --> 01:14:37,024
<i>- Buy her.
- One-fifty.</i>

839
01:14:37,061 --> 01:14:39,065
<i>Two hundred.</i>

840
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:42,112
<i>Two-fifty, three, 350.</i>

841
01:14:42,148 --> 01:14:45,940
<i>Three hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

842
01:14:46,024 --> 01:14:48,695
<i>Four. Four.</i>

843
01:14:48,731 --> 01:14:51,402
<i>Four-fifty, 450.</i>

844
01:14:51,439 --> 01:14:53,773
<i>Four hundred and fifty thousand.</i>

845
01:14:53,981 --> 01:14:55,564
<i>Four-fifty.</i>

846
01:14:56,231 --> 01:14:58,355
<i>Five hundred. 500,000.</i>

847
01:14:58,392 --> 01:15:02,777
<i>Five hundred thousand. Sold.</i>

848
01:15:02,813 --> 01:15:06,981
<i>That concludes the sales for tonight.
Thank you all for coming.</i>

849
01:15:07,017 --> 01:15:10,110
<i>- You can collect your purchases directly.
- Move.</i>

850
01:15:10,147 --> 01:15:14,646
- You will never get away with this.
- If you wanna live, you'll make sure I do.

851
01:15:23,979 --> 01:15:26,937
Now, Mister?

852
01:15:32,644 --> 01:15:36,562
Well, we know you're not this man.
So, what do we call you?

853
01:15:39,353 --> 01:15:41,441
It doesn't matter what we call you...

854
01:15:41,478 --> 01:15:44,436
...what does matter
is what you're doing here.

855
01:15:45,311 --> 01:15:47,728
The last girl, I'm her father.

856
01:15:49,810 --> 01:15:53,435
- Oh, my.
- Give her to me.

857
01:15:54,226 --> 01:15:56,373
I wish I could, honestly.

858
01:15:56,409 --> 01:15:58,482
See, I'm a father myself.

859
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:00,690
I have two sons and a daughter...

860
01:16:00,726 --> 01:16:03,934
but let me tell you something,
Mr. Whoever You Are.

861
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,398
This is a business.

862
01:16:05,434 --> 01:16:07,315
This is a very unique business...

863
01:16:07,351 --> 01:16:10,273
- with a very unique clientele.
- I'll pay.

864
01:16:10,309 --> 01:16:12,934
In this business,
you have no refunds, returns...

865
01:16:12,971 --> 01:16:15,147
discounts, buybacks.
All sales are final.

866
01:16:15,183 --> 01:16:20,517
Besides discretion,
it's about the only rule we have.

867
01:16:21,975 --> 01:16:24,974
Kill him. Quietly. I have guests.

868
01:17:22,637 --> 01:17:25,179
Would you please go see
which part of "quietly"...

869
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:28,345
- they did not understand?
- Yes, sir.

870
01:17:47,052 --> 01:17:50,594
Okay, we can resolve this.
I know how you feel.

871
01:17:50,631 --> 01:17:54,135
We should talk, okay?
We can work this out.

872
01:17:55,927 --> 01:17:58,135
You have no idea...

873
01:17:58,718 --> 01:18:00,323
- Where is she?
- Please.

874
01:18:00,359 --> 01:18:01,927
Understand. Please try...

875
01:18:06,135 --> 01:18:09,676
There's a boat by the quay.

876
01:18:10,426 --> 01:18:12,051
Please understand.

877
01:18:12,093 --> 01:18:16,634
It was all business,
it wasn't personal.

878
01:18:16,671 --> 01:18:18,883
It was all personal to me.

879
01:21:05,016 --> 01:21:06,975
It's ready.

880
01:22:07,941 --> 01:22:10,607
You... take the girls.

881
01:22:10,608 --> 01:22:13,067
You... follow me.

882
01:22:13,108 --> 01:22:15,775
Invaders!  Search the boat.

883
01:22:53,447 --> 01:22:55,031
Where are you?

884
01:22:56,864 --> 01:22:58,448
Why aren't you answering?

885
01:23:24,451 --> 01:23:26,285
Get inside!

886
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:28,243
What's the problem?

887
01:23:28,327 --> 01:23:30,577
The girls father has arrived.

888
01:23:30,619 --> 01:23:31,577
Leave it to me.

889
01:25:15,022 --> 01:25:16,564
We can...

890
01:25:28,064 --> 01:25:32,229
- Daddy.
- Kim.

891
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:35,146
You came for me.

892
01:25:39,229 --> 01:25:41,187
You came for me.

893
01:25:43,437 --> 01:25:46,020
I told you I would.

894
01:26:14,476 --> 01:26:18,102
<i>May I have your attention.
If you're waiting for oversized bags...</i>

895
01:26:19,102 --> 01:26:21,476
Mom.

896
01:26:22,726 --> 01:26:25,288
Oh, my God.

897
01:26:25,324 --> 01:26:27,851
Oh, sweetie.

898
01:26:28,018 --> 01:26:30,496
Oh, here, let me get that for you.

899
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:32,975
Bryan, if there's anything you need...

900
01:26:33,808 --> 01:26:36,142
I've got everything I need.

901
01:26:36,178 --> 01:26:39,267
I love you so much.

902
01:26:40,891 --> 01:26:43,475
Stuart.

903
01:26:43,892 --> 01:26:46,391
Thank you.

904
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:56,265
<i>Attention, travelers.
You are not required to...</i>

905
01:26:56,301 --> 01:26:58,682
Shall we go?

906
01:27:03,223 --> 01:27:06,181
Sure you don't wanna ride with us?

907
01:27:06,306 --> 01:27:11,472
- I'll be fine. I'll take a cab. Thanks.
- All right.

908
01:27:19,264 --> 01:27:21,972
- I love you, Dad.
- Love you too.

909
01:27:44,554 --> 01:27:48,012
- Where are we?
- I told you. It's a surprise.

910
01:27:49,512 --> 01:27:51,970
- Hi.
- Hi.

911
01:27:54,386 --> 01:27:58,344
When someone says "hi,"
it's usually polite to say "hi" back.

912
01:27:58,594 --> 01:27:59,808
Hi.

913
01:27:59,844 --> 01:28:01,511
I heard you wanna be a singer.

914
01:28:01,548 --> 01:28:03,761
- I do.
- She does.

915
01:28:04,844 --> 01:28:08,718
Well, come on in.
Let's see what you got.
