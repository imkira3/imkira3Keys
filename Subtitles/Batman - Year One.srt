00:00:39,278 --> 00:00:40,529
<i>Gotham City.</i>

3
00:00:40,696 --> 00:00:44,742
<i>Clean shafts of concrete
and snowy rooftops.</i>

4
00:00:44,909 --> 00:00:48,162
<i>The work of men
who died generations ago.</i>

5
00:00:49,205 --> 00:00:52,667
<i>From here, it looks like an achievement.</i>

6
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,964
<i>From here, you can't see the enemy.</i>

7
00:01:06,514 --> 00:01:08,933
Hey. Hey, buddy, slow down.

8
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,102
- You're talking to me?
Yeah, you almost...

9
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:12,728
<i>Twelve hours.</i>

10
00:01:12,895 --> 00:01:15,481
<i>Train's no way to come to the city.</i>

11
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:18,651
- Knock it off.
- Hey, watch it.

12
00:01:19,235 --> 00:01:20,945
<i>Thank God Barbara's flying in.</i>

13
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:23,531
<i>She should have gotten
the tests back by now.</i>

14
00:01:23,698 --> 00:01:27,618
<i>I only hate myself a little
for hoping they came out negative.</i>

15
00:01:27,785 --> 00:01:30,162
<i>This is no place to raise a family.</i>

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,670
<i>Maybe Gotham's all I deserve now.</i>

17
00:01:38,254 --> 00:01:41,090
<i>Maybe it's just my time in hell.</i>

18
00:01:56,105 --> 00:01:59,025
Nice book for a small donation.

19
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:03,487
Nice book for a small donation.

20
00:02:03,654 --> 00:02:04,780
No, please.

21
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:07,533
Nice book. Look at the picture... Aah!

22
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,286
They don't know when to quit,
do they, lieutenant?

23
00:02:10,453 --> 00:02:12,663
Name's Flass. Detective Flass.

24
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,874
Commissioner Loeb sent me to meet you.

25
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:17,793
He wanted to make sure
you didn't miss your appointment.

26
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:23,132
Welcome to Gotham, lieutenant.

27
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:25,217
Don't worry. Not as bad as it looks.

28
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:26,677
Especially if you're a cop.

29
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:30,431
Cops got it made it Gotham.

30
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:36,729
Are we rolling?

31
00:02:36,896 --> 00:02:39,273
Sir, a moment of your time.

32
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,776
Welcome home, Mr. Wayne.
How's it feel to be back?

33
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:43,444
What are your plans, Mr. Wayne?

34
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:46,489
Mr. Wayne, Princess Caroline,
any truth to the rumors?

35
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,532
Mr. Wayne, please,
can you look over here?

36
00:02:48,699 --> 00:02:50,826
The 25-year-old heir
to the Wayne millions...

37
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:53,955
...declined to comment on his return home
after 12 years abroad.

38
00:02:54,121 --> 00:02:58,209
<i>We'll keep you posted on Gotham's richest
and best looking native son.</i>

39
00:02:58,376 --> 00:02:59,835
<i>- Tom?
- Thank you, Vicky.</i>

40
00:03:00,002 --> 00:03:01,754
<i>Vicky Vale at Gotham Airport.</i>

41
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:05,216
<i>In other news, conspiracy charges against
Police Commissioner Loeb...</i>

42
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:08,511
<i>...were withdrawn today after
the disappearance of a key witness.</i>

43
00:03:09,679 --> 00:03:11,681
Lieutenant James Gordon.

44
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:14,850
Impressive. Very impressive.

45
00:03:15,309 --> 00:03:17,687
We're delighted to have you
on the team, lieutenant.

46
00:03:18,104 --> 00:03:20,189
You'll get my best work, sir. I promise.

47
00:03:20,356 --> 00:03:21,357
I know I will.

48
00:03:21,524 --> 00:03:24,151
And we are a team, Gordon. A team.

49
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:28,614
Any team needs to play together
in order to win, don't you think?

50
00:03:28,781 --> 00:03:30,116
Yes, it does.

51
00:03:30,283 --> 00:03:33,202
Your record shows
you've got what it takes.

52
00:03:33,369 --> 00:03:35,371
I know I've made my mistakes, sir.

53
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:37,582
What mistakes did you make, lieutenant?

54
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,042
You kept the media away from it.

55
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:43,045
That's all that matters, isn't it? Yes, it is.

56
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,299
You won't have to worry
about my honesty, commissioner.

57
00:03:46,465 --> 00:03:48,884
Last thing on my mind.

58
00:03:49,051 --> 00:03:50,886
Last thing.

59
00:04:16,078 --> 00:04:20,124
Welcome home, Master Bruce.
- Thank you, Alfred.

60
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,253
It's good to be back.

61
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,099
I knew you'd like the commissioner.
He's a stand-up guy.

62
00:04:37,266 --> 00:04:40,811
And he'll be just as good to you
as you are to him. Count on it.

63
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,147
Yeah, I got that feeling.

64
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:53,449
- Flass.
Nothing I can't handle, lieutenant.

65
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:57,119
Hey, Stevie, mother know you're here?

66
00:04:57,286 --> 00:04:58,621
Oh, crap.

67
00:05:01,457 --> 00:05:03,084
<i>He's got a Green Beret's training.</i>

68
00:05:04,794 --> 00:05:06,337
<i>He knows how to use his size too.</i>

69
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,507
<i>Don't do a damn thing.</i>

70
00:05:10,258 --> 00:05:14,053
<i>Be sure of your facts
before you bring down another cop.</i>

71
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:16,180
<i>Just watch him.</i>

72
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,641
<i>Memorize every move.</i>

73
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:21,560
<i>For future reference.</i>

74
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,024
Was that necessary?

75
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,652
Had this little beauty in his pocket.

76
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,989
It's a comb, Flass.

77
00:05:33,489 --> 00:05:35,408
Hey, I'm only human, Jimmy.

78
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,660
Mind if I call you Jimmy?

79
00:05:50,923 --> 00:05:52,341
<i>Twelve years.</i>

80
00:05:52,508 --> 00:05:55,177
<i>And the ache is still fresh.</i>

81
00:05:55,344 --> 00:05:57,847
<i>Like a raw angry nerve.</i>

82
00:06:02,768 --> 00:06:05,021
<i>But this isn't about healing.</i>

83
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,899
<i>I'm not looking for closure.</i>

84
00:06:17,825 --> 00:06:20,411
The boys, Jimmy.
They've been asking me to talk to you.

85
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:22,705
They're worried about you.

86
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:25,374
I mean, you with a baby
on the way and all.

87
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,960
- Call me lieutenant.
- Yeah, sure thing, Jimmy.

88
00:06:28,127 --> 00:06:29,795
You gotta learn to relax.

89
00:06:29,962 --> 00:06:33,174
See, we got our own way of doing things
here in Gotham.

90
00:06:42,391 --> 00:06:45,937
This job can get to you, Jimmy.
That's why we gotta stick together.

91
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:48,231
The boys need to know
they can count on you.

92
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,402
We can count on you, right?

93
00:07:19,637 --> 00:07:21,764
Hey. Everything okay?

94
00:07:25,434 --> 00:07:27,311
It is now.

95
00:07:43,077 --> 00:07:44,954
<i>I'm not ready.</i>

96
00:07:45,121 --> 00:07:47,707
<i>I have the means, the skill...</i>

97
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,799
<i>But something's missing.</i>

98
00:07:58,968 --> 00:08:00,970
<i>I have to wait.</i>

99
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,807
<i>I have to wait.</i>

100
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:14,483
And Gordon,
he looks at the 50 like it's diseased.

101
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:16,485
Then throws it in the padre's face.

102
00:08:16,652 --> 00:08:20,031
Gives the entire squad
a two-hour lecture on ethics.

103
00:08:20,197 --> 00:08:21,824
Put Schell on probation.

104
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:25,328
I'm telling you, Gill,
he's just not fitting in.

105
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:30,499
I had such high hopes for that boy.

106
00:08:37,006 --> 00:08:40,051
<i>I requested off this
damn night shift four times now.</i>

107
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:42,178
<i>Barbara needs me.</i>

108
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,221
<i>Barbara and little James.</i>

109
00:08:44,388 --> 00:08:46,349
<i>So I hope it's a boy, so what?</i>

110
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:49,018
Going to work, lieutenant?

111
00:08:53,522 --> 00:08:56,901
You're gonna be a little late.
May have to skip the whole night.

112
00:09:02,823 --> 00:09:04,784
<i>I was taught to handle worse than this.</i>

113
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,993
<i>But then...</i>

114
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:09,914
<i>It's been a while.</i>

115
00:09:22,677 --> 00:09:25,721
Consider this a warning. Be smart.

116
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:29,392
Think of that pregnant wife of yours,
Jimmy.

117
00:09:46,951 --> 00:09:48,578
<i>This is reconnaissance mission.</i>

118
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:53,416
<i>Until I'm ready,
my anonymity is an obvious priority.</i>

119
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:56,919
<i>All it requires is a change of clothing
and complexion.</i>

120
00:09:57,086 --> 00:10:01,090
<i>And a single memorable
distracting detail.</i>

121
00:10:03,968 --> 00:10:06,596
<i>It's a 20-block walk to the enemy camp.</i>

122
00:10:06,762 --> 00:10:08,222
<i>The East End.</i>

123
00:10:18,858 --> 00:10:21,611
<i>Hard to believe it's gotten worse.</i>

124
00:10:24,405 --> 00:10:26,449
Cheer you up, mister?

125
00:10:29,952 --> 00:10:33,497
- How old are you?
- Young as you want me to be.

126
00:10:33,664 --> 00:10:36,042
Stupid little bitch.
You're doing it all wrong.

127
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,045
- But I did what you said.
- Get on out of here.

128
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:41,797
- We'll talk this over later.
No.

129
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:43,799
I think you're finished with her.

130
00:10:45,092 --> 00:10:48,804
Man, that crazy vet thing is old.
You stink like vice.

131
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:51,807
I'm not the police. Believe me.

132
00:10:53,976 --> 00:10:56,520
Selina, don't stop now.

133
00:10:57,313 --> 00:10:59,190
He can't be vice. We're paid up.

134
00:10:59,357 --> 00:11:01,776
Selina, what are you doing?

135
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:05,655
Watching some idiot
trying to get himself killed.

136
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:08,282
Man, you're pushing.

137
00:11:08,449 --> 00:11:11,494
You're looking for a new scar.
Just tell me where you want it.

138
00:11:20,586 --> 00:11:22,505
Come on. Get him.

139
00:12:02,628 --> 00:12:04,338
Freeze.

140
00:12:12,471 --> 00:12:14,724
Jeez, Eddie, why did you shoot?
He didn't move.

141
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:17,393
He was going to.

142
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,734
- Any cash?
Couple of bucks.

143
00:12:24,901 --> 00:12:26,694
No ID.

144
00:12:28,154 --> 00:12:32,116
Oh, he's bleeding all over the backseat.
What if he dies?

145
00:12:32,283 --> 00:12:36,120
So, what if he does?
One less mouth to feed at the soup kitchen.

146
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:37,455
You two.

147
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:39,916
Stop the car. Get out.

148
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:41,250
What the hell?

149
00:12:41,417 --> 00:12:44,211
Don't mind him.
Probably hopped up on something.

150
00:13:08,778 --> 00:13:10,738
<i>Scum maybe.</i>

151
00:13:10,905 --> 00:13:13,783
<i>But even scum have families.</i>

152
00:13:37,765 --> 00:13:40,017
<i>Detective Flass is off duty, lieutenant.</i>

153
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:43,646
<i>He and the guys have a poker party
every Wednesday night over at Chutes.</i>

154
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:19,932
No. I said posse.

155
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:22,893
See you guys tomorrow.

156
00:15:37,426 --> 00:15:39,428
Hello, Jimmy.

157
00:15:42,807 --> 00:15:46,185
<i>It's been years
since I had to take out a Green Beret.</i>

158
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:50,606
<i>Even so, he deserves a handicap.</i>

159
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:18,968
<i>He'll never report it.</i>

160
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,469
<i>Not Flass.</i>

161
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:23,848
<i>He'll make up some story
that involves at least 10 attackers.</i>

162
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:29,645
<i>But he'll know.</i>

163
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:33,274
<i>And he'll stay away from Barbara.</i>

164
00:16:55,129 --> 00:16:57,798
<i>I've tried to be patient.</i>

165
00:16:57,965 --> 00:16:59,717
<i>I've tried to wait.</i>

166
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,011
<i>But I have to know.</i>

167
00:17:02,178 --> 00:17:04,347
<i>How, Father?</i>

168
00:17:04,513 --> 00:17:05,932
<i>How do I do it?</i>

169
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:10,519
<i>What do I use to make them afraid?</i>

170
00:17:12,021 --> 00:17:15,524
<i>If I ring the bell, Alfred will come.</i>

171
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:19,028
<i>Another of your gifts to me, Father.</i>

172
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:24,659
<i>But I'd rather die than wait another hour.</i>

173
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:28,788
<i>I've already waited 18 years.</i>

174
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:19,755
<i>Eighteen years
since all sense left my life.</i>

175
00:18:48,784 --> 00:18:50,786
<i>Yes, Father.</i>

176
00:19:06,886 --> 00:19:08,971
<i>He's held four children at gun point.</i>

177
00:19:09,138 --> 00:19:11,390
<i>Reportedly he has a history
of mental illness.</i>

178
00:19:11,557 --> 00:19:14,101
<i>SWAT team lead by Brendon
has just arrived...</i>

179
00:19:14,268 --> 00:19:15,478
<i>Crap. Brendon?</i>

180
00:19:15,645 --> 00:19:17,313
<i>Lt'll be a massacre.</i>

181
00:19:20,816 --> 00:19:24,737
<i>Last month, he and his lunatic gestapo
calmed down a riot in Robinson Park.</i>

182
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:27,657
<i>He didn't even leave
the statues standing.</i>

183
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:36,123
No. Don't want.

184
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,000
Isn't blank.

185
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,003
Damn it, Merkel. I'm not here to argue,
I'm here to clean up.

186
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,673
Lieutenant Gordon is on his way, sir.
I really think...

187
00:19:43,839 --> 00:19:46,342
To hell with that spineless bastard.
Now stand aside.

188
00:19:51,889 --> 00:19:54,725
Go find your own war, Brendon.
I'll take it from here.

189
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:13,869
<i>Intense hostage situation in midtown,
at the corner of Richmond and Todd...</i>

190
00:20:14,036 --> 00:20:17,373
<i>...we're getting reports that the gunman
has history of mental illness...</i>

191
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,751
<i>...and was apparently released
from Arkham Asylum.</i>

192
00:20:36,517 --> 00:20:37,685
Take it easy, friend.

193
00:20:37,852 --> 00:20:39,854
No. Defibrillate.

194
00:20:40,021 --> 00:20:42,231
No lunch. No lunch.

195
00:20:42,398 --> 00:20:45,276
It's okay, pal. We'll order out.

196
00:20:45,443 --> 00:20:47,361
No lunch. No gangrene lunch.

197
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,718
Who wants gum?

198
00:21:11,761 --> 00:21:14,055
You really handled that well, Brendon.

199
00:21:14,597 --> 00:21:16,933
What was I suppose to do?
Disobey a direct order?

200
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,561
- Something's gotta be done.
- I'd like nothing better.

201
00:21:20,728 --> 00:21:22,438
But we must be patient.

202
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:27,151
Gordon has the press on his side.
He's a hero.

203
00:21:54,553 --> 00:21:56,180
<i>I hate the job.</i>

204
00:21:57,723 --> 00:21:59,225
<i>I hate the gun.</i>

205
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:02,979
<i>But I keep practicing.</i>

206
00:22:07,316 --> 00:22:09,735
<i>How did I let this happen?</i>

207
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,407
<i>To bring an innocent child to life.</i>

208
00:22:15,241 --> 00:22:17,660
<i>In a city without hope.</i>

209
00:22:31,716 --> 00:22:34,385
I could use a jackhammer on your back.

210
00:22:34,552 --> 00:22:35,928
Oh. You're doing fine, honey.

211
00:22:38,681 --> 00:22:40,182
Ignore it.

212
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,185
Hello?

213
00:22:43,352 --> 00:22:45,187
<i>I'm sorry, Mrs. Gordon...</i>

214
00:22:47,815 --> 00:22:49,317
It's Merkel at the station.

215
00:22:49,483 --> 00:22:51,944
Something about a giant bat.

216
00:22:52,445 --> 00:22:54,363
The chicken'll keep.

217
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,906
<i>Amateur.</i>

218
00:23:37,073 --> 00:23:38,950
<i>Lucky amateur.</i>

219
00:23:41,035 --> 00:23:42,912
Some of you know Detective Essen.

220
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:46,916
She has returned to Gotham from Lakeside
to help with our investigation.

221
00:23:51,254 --> 00:23:53,214
Okay, okay. Listen up.

222
00:23:53,381 --> 00:23:57,802
Our vigilante, or Batman,
as the news shows are calling him...

223
00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,097
...has committed 70 assaults
in the past five weeks.

224
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:04,016
Now during this time,
certain patterns have emerged.

225
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:05,601
Thank you, detective.

226
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:08,854
He operates between the hours of midnight
and 4 a. m.

227
00:24:09,021 --> 00:24:11,190
Concentrating his efforts
in the East End.

228
00:24:11,357 --> 00:24:14,110
This Batman is working his way up
the crime ladder.

229
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:17,113
From junkie to pusher to supplier.

230
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,657
No one appears safe. Not even cops.

231
00:24:19,824 --> 00:24:23,536
- Right, Detective Flass?
- He's not human.

232
00:24:26,372 --> 00:24:27,832
Gentlemen.

233
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:30,084
Why don't you tell us what happened.

234
00:24:30,251 --> 00:24:31,877
And try not to exaggerate.

235
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:35,172
It's like I said in my report.

236
00:24:35,339 --> 00:24:39,635
<i>I received an anonymous tip leading me
to an East End cocaine delivery.</i>

237
00:24:39,802 --> 00:24:42,805
<i>I was on the process of single-handedly
apprehending the felons.</i>

238
00:24:42,972 --> 00:24:46,642
<i>It came out of the night sky.
Wings 30 feet across.</i>

239
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:52,231
<i>One of the felons I have not yet disarmed,
produced a gun, fired point blank...</i>

240
00:24:52,398 --> 00:24:55,610
<i>...bullet passed right through
the creature like it wasn't there.</i>

241
00:24:56,068 --> 00:24:58,905
<i>Something flew from its hand.
Little dart things.</i>

242
00:24:59,071 --> 00:25:01,699
<i>Paralyzed everyone. Except me.</i>

243
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:04,410
It singled me out. It had claws.

244
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:06,203
I'm telling you it isn't human.

245
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:08,623
Gentlemen, please.

246
00:25:27,975 --> 00:25:30,144
Have you seen Batman, commissioner?

247
00:25:30,311 --> 00:25:32,021
They say he's huge.

248
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:33,814
You shouldn't pry, Marian.

249
00:25:33,981 --> 00:25:36,192
Gill has his hands full these days.

250
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:40,321
We're trusting him
to cope with Batman and Gordon.

251
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:45,034
Whoever this bat person is, he's a having
a positive effect on public spirit.

252
00:25:45,201 --> 00:25:47,495
Street crime has dropped significantly.

253
00:25:47,662 --> 00:25:50,081
Hell, Gill, maybe you ought
to offer him a job.

254
00:25:52,917 --> 00:25:55,127
Hey, hey, let's not kid ourselves.

255
00:25:55,294 --> 00:25:57,463
Batman is costing us all money.

256
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:00,049
Two sides to everything, friends.

257
00:26:00,216 --> 00:26:01,634
Look at the long term.

258
00:26:01,801 --> 00:26:05,137
A few street operators
are put out of action, yes...

259
00:26:05,304 --> 00:26:07,848
...but the people of Gotham have a hero.

260
00:26:08,015 --> 00:26:09,392
Makes them feel safe.

261
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:13,896
And the safer they feel,
the fewer questions they ask, right, Gill?

262
00:26:21,445 --> 00:26:24,156
I don't like it. It's stirring things up.

263
00:26:24,574 --> 00:26:28,035
And with Gordon pushing Internal Affairs
to go after Flass...

264
00:26:28,202 --> 00:26:30,246
...Flass would be difficult to replace.

265
00:26:30,413 --> 00:26:33,791
- And if he were to talk...
- Let me worry about Flass.

266
00:26:35,376 --> 00:26:39,213
Relax, Carmine.
I got everything under control.

267
00:26:43,968 --> 00:26:47,096
- What is going on?
- The lights? What happened to the lights?

268
00:26:51,767 --> 00:26:54,061
Ladies, gentlemen...

269
00:26:54,562 --> 00:26:56,147
...you've eaten well.

270
00:26:56,314 --> 00:26:58,608
You've eaten Gotham's wealth.

271
00:26:58,774 --> 00:26:59,942
Its spirit.

272
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:02,612
But your feast is nearly over.

273
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:08,993
From this moment on,
none of you are safe.

274
00:27:10,953 --> 00:27:12,288
No excuses.

275
00:27:12,455 --> 00:27:15,750
That vigilante bastard
goes under, instantly.

276
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,377
Or it's your job.

277
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:31,557
<i>She knows how to walk in heels.</i>

278
00:27:32,058 --> 00:27:34,101
<i>So few women do these days.</i>

279
00:27:35,937 --> 00:27:37,563
<i>And she knows how to scream.</i>

280
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:41,609
<i>You could hear it from the rooftops.</i>

281
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,365
<i>Gordon is wasting a lot of manpower
on these traps.</i>

282
00:27:58,834 --> 00:28:00,628
We'll try again tomorrow night.

283
00:28:25,361 --> 00:28:28,030
Mr. Falcone, your Rolls, it's gone.

284
00:28:28,197 --> 00:28:30,658
He took it. Said it's in the river.

285
00:28:30,825 --> 00:28:32,702
Thinks he's a damn Robin Hood.

286
00:28:33,369 --> 00:28:35,538
He dies.

287
00:28:37,873 --> 00:28:40,251
He knows when and where
we sets our traps for him...

288
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:43,879
...and night after nights, he terrorizes
the most powerful men in Gotham.

289
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:47,800
- Heard what he did to the Roman's car?
- Laughed myself silly.

290
00:28:47,967 --> 00:28:49,302
A Rolls-Royce.

291
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:51,971
You've been after the Roman for years.

292
00:28:52,138 --> 00:28:55,224
Some of your witnesses
changed their testimony. Others vanished.

293
00:28:55,391 --> 00:28:57,560
- Must be frustrating.
- Oh, yes.

294
00:28:57,727 --> 00:29:00,521
- Do you mind?
- Go for it.

295
00:29:01,647 --> 00:29:05,192
I understand he used his muscle
to keep you from making DA.

296
00:29:08,821 --> 00:29:12,450
- You keep in shape, don't you, Mr. Dent?
- What are you driving at, lieutenant?

297
00:29:13,451 --> 00:29:16,954
I need to know where you were
on the following dates.

298
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,875
Thank you, sir.

299
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,760
I thought he'd never leave.

300
00:29:30,927 --> 00:29:33,012
You can come out now.

301
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:46,400
He had an alibi for every date, Essen.

302
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:49,070
Says he was home
between midnight and 4 with his wife.

303
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:50,529
No point in questioning her.

304
00:29:50,696 --> 00:29:53,699
- You really think he's Batman, lieutenant?
- It's possible.

305
00:29:53,866 --> 00:29:55,743
Dent certainly is passionate enough.

306
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,955
But it takes more than muscles
to fight the way Batman does.

307
00:29:59,121 --> 00:30:00,706
And to get around the way he does.

308
00:30:00,873 --> 00:30:03,459
And those weapons?
I mean, he's got an arsenal.

309
00:30:03,876 --> 00:30:07,171
Hard to afford on a blue-collar salary.

310
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,048
- Money, lieutenant.
- Hmm?

311
00:30:09,215 --> 00:30:11,592
Bruce Wayne
is the richest man in Gotham.

312
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,928
Being from out of town,
you might not know...

313
00:30:14,095 --> 00:30:17,431
...but Wayne's parents were murdered,
by a mugger, I think.

314
00:30:17,974 --> 00:30:20,142
He was just a little boy at the time.

315
00:30:20,309 --> 00:30:21,978
Essen, I could kiss you.

316
00:30:22,144 --> 00:30:23,354
Jim.

317
00:30:28,484 --> 00:30:30,152
Hold on.

318
00:30:36,742 --> 00:30:38,536
Take the wheel.

319
00:30:55,344 --> 00:30:57,221
Don't move.

320
00:30:57,597 --> 00:31:00,141
Lieutenant, you all right?
I called for back-up.

321
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:01,934
Essen.

322
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:06,314
Stop. Or I'll...

323
00:31:10,943 --> 00:31:13,654
It's Batman. He went down that alley.

324
00:31:22,622 --> 00:31:24,332
Get the front of that place covered.

325
00:31:24,498 --> 00:31:28,127
Merkel, take a squad to the roof
No one fires without my order.

326
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:44,977
Batman hasn't attacked anybody.
There's no need for Brendon.

327
00:31:45,144 --> 00:31:46,646
I've got the situation in hand.

328
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:02,245
Oh, no.

329
00:32:02,411 --> 00:32:03,579
Everybody, back.

330
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:05,206
- Move it back.
- Move, move, move.

331
00:32:05,373 --> 00:32:07,250
Clear the area.

332
00:33:00,511 --> 00:33:01,971
Selina.

333
00:33:02,138 --> 00:33:04,181
Selina, come see.

334
00:33:08,394 --> 00:33:11,022
Five in the morning? Come on, Holly.

335
00:33:11,188 --> 00:33:12,648
I'm serious, Selina.

336
00:33:12,815 --> 00:33:14,150
Things are blowing up.

337
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,486
Brendon's probably cornered
some jaywalker.

338
00:33:17,653 --> 00:33:19,030
Turn on the TV.

339
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:21,949
Gotta be something on about it.

340
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:37,006
- Lock and load.
Brendon.

341
00:33:37,214 --> 00:33:40,760
Keep your men under control.
No one fires unless I say.

342
00:33:40,927 --> 00:33:44,222
Not this time, Gordon.
The commissioner wants a corpse.

343
00:33:44,388 --> 00:33:46,224
He's gonna get one.

344
00:33:47,934 --> 00:33:50,394
All units entering the target area.

345
00:33:50,561 --> 00:33:52,647
No prisoners, men.

346
00:33:57,526 --> 00:33:59,654
<i>Batman has been surrounded
by Gotham police...</i>

347
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:02,281
<i>...inside an abandoned tenement
off Robinson Park.</i>

348
00:34:02,448 --> 00:34:04,075
Selina, it's Batman.

349
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:06,535
- Can we?
- What the hell?

350
00:34:07,286 --> 00:34:08,871
Grab your coat.

351
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:14,252
<i>Unit 1 reporting,
second floor's a mess.</i>

352
00:34:14,418 --> 00:34:15,711
<i>Nothing living.</i>

353
00:34:15,878 --> 00:34:19,298
<i>Unit 2 reporting, body under
the water-heater just an old wino.</i>

354
00:34:23,386 --> 00:34:26,556
If he made it down there,
he might have survived.

355
00:34:31,727 --> 00:34:33,437
Check it out.

356
00:34:56,043 --> 00:34:58,170
Super must have lived here.

357
00:34:58,879 --> 00:35:00,590
What the hell is going on?

358
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:03,718
Open that goddamn door.

359
00:35:03,884 --> 00:35:06,304
<i>I like you right where you are, Brendon.</i>

360
00:35:06,429 --> 00:35:08,890
Too many people have already died.

361
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:10,808
Order your squads to withdraw.

362
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,144
<i>I can't guarantee their safety.</i>

363
00:35:13,311 --> 00:35:16,272
Units 1 and 2, converge on the lobby.
He's here.

364
00:35:16,439 --> 00:35:18,691
<i>Shoot on sight.</i>

365
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:26,824
I need a mask.

366
00:35:29,076 --> 00:35:30,953
<i>Goddamn. Unit 1, do you read me?</i>

367
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,955
Seems like Brendon is in trouble.

368
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:35,708
I wish I could help, but orders are orders.

369
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:37,877
It breaks my heart.

370
00:35:43,799 --> 00:35:45,885
Sir, he's taken out Unit 3.

371
00:35:46,052 --> 00:35:48,638
The entire unit, commissioner.

372
00:35:48,971 --> 00:35:51,891
You better shoot straight, son.

373
00:35:57,146 --> 00:35:58,648
<i>I've made a mess of things.</i>

374
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:01,525
<i>Let it get out of hand.</i>

375
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:04,528
Step it up. Step it up.

376
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,990
Careful,
these stairs are about to give way.

377
00:36:13,204 --> 00:36:14,372
Hold your fire.

378
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:16,457
It's a bat we're after.

379
00:36:19,627 --> 00:36:22,672
<i>With my belt gone,
I'm down to a blow gun.</i>

380
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:28,219
<i>Three darts and an unofficial invention
of Wayne Electronics.</i>

381
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:34,100
<i>Haven't tested it
for this great a distance.</i>

382
00:36:34,267 --> 00:36:37,770
<i>It took me weeks
to find the right ultrasonic tone.</i>

383
00:36:37,937 --> 00:36:41,023
<i>A tone that acts as an attractant.</i>

384
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:48,197
Whoever Batman is, he's stronger than I...

385
00:36:48,364 --> 00:36:49,740
Shut up. He could be anywhere.

386
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,891
Cease fire, you idiots.

387
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,781
I'm gonna cut that bastard in half.

388
00:37:58,142 --> 00:37:59,977
Yeah.

389
00:38:01,479 --> 00:38:04,106
<i>They've made a hero out of him.</i>

390
00:38:53,823 --> 00:38:57,159
There, the motorcycle. After him.

391
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,629
Shoot him, you idiot. Kill him.

392
00:39:08,796 --> 00:39:10,381
Kill him.

393
00:39:21,767 --> 00:39:23,227
I can't see a thing.

394
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:38,993
<i>Every member of Brendon's team...</i>

395
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:43,831
<i>...every cop and everybody in the crowd
were vaccinated for their bat bites.</i>

396
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:49,629
<i>Never have so many had so much trouble
sitting down.</i>

397
00:39:51,255 --> 00:39:54,425
<i>Four of Brendon's men
were hospitalized with broken bones.</i>

398
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:58,638
<i>Brendon himself suffered five broken ribs
and internal bleeding.</i>

399
00:39:59,055 --> 00:40:03,142
<i>The dead winos had no relatives
to complain about their fire bombing.</i>

400
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:06,646
<i>Everyone who could have ordered
Brendon and Loeb up on charges...</i>

401
00:40:06,812 --> 00:40:11,234
<i>...remains unavailable to me
by appointment or telephone.</i>

402
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,361
I spoke to his butler.

403
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:16,280
Wayne has been skiing in Switzerland
for the past six weeks.

404
00:40:16,447 --> 00:40:20,451
Apparently, he took a nasty spill,
broke both legs and an arm.

405
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,788
Cast on his arm and legs
would cover bullet wounds.

406
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:26,332
Exactly where Batman received them.

407
00:40:26,499 --> 00:40:27,792
You're relentless, Essen.

408
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:29,585
Only when I want something.

409
00:40:29,752 --> 00:40:31,295
Well, quitting time.

410
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,798
- We'll pick it up tomorrow.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:40:35,758 --> 00:40:36,842
Share a cab?

412
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,136
Uh...

413
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:41,681
Sure.

414
00:40:52,024 --> 00:40:54,110
Selina, you punched Stan.

415
00:40:54,318 --> 00:40:57,321
We're changing our line of work, Holly.

416
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,992
Why a cop?

417
00:41:01,117 --> 00:41:04,328
I was told I was too masculine
for about six other careers.

418
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:09,000
Whoever said you were masculine
must have been blind, deaf and dead.

419
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,963
Mind if I ask you a personal question?

420
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:17,508
I know why I'm here.

421
00:41:17,675 --> 00:41:21,679
But what are you doing here?
In Gotham, I mean.

422
00:41:22,889 --> 00:41:25,850
It's a long, sordid story.

423
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,936
The bullet points are police corruption.

424
00:41:29,103 --> 00:41:31,314
A cop who wanted to believe
the system works...

425
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,858
...and one incredibly bad decision.

426
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,986
There's a reason
everyone hates Internal Affairs.

427
00:41:37,153 --> 00:41:39,697
They dangle the carrot
of integrity and honesty.

428
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:42,867
But at the end of the day,
when you take down another cop...

429
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:46,495
...they treat you
like any other low-life scumbag.

430
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,005
I'm sorry.

431
00:42:28,204 --> 00:42:30,498
You spent the last of our money on that?

432
00:42:30,665 --> 00:42:32,416
It's not even Halloween.

433
00:42:32,917 --> 00:42:37,588
Sometimes, Holly,
you have to spend money to make money.

434
00:42:38,714 --> 00:42:40,758
Selina.

435
00:42:46,889 --> 00:42:49,183
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

436
00:42:51,811 --> 00:42:53,980
<i>I need to stop this thing with Sarah.</i>

437
00:42:54,146 --> 00:42:55,314
<i>Oh, God.</i>

438
00:42:55,481 --> 00:42:57,650
<i>Calling her Sarah now.</i>

439
00:42:58,067 --> 00:42:59,944
<i>I need to come clean with Barbara.</i>

440
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:01,571
<i>Beg for forgiveness.</i>

441
00:43:02,446 --> 00:43:05,283
<i>But I can't stop thinking about her...</i>

442
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:08,411
<i>...like I can't stop thinking
about this Batman.</i>

443
00:43:09,036 --> 00:43:11,247
<i>He's a criminal, I'm a cop.</i>

444
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:12,999
<i>It's as simple as that.</i>

445
00:43:13,165 --> 00:43:17,295
<i>But I'm a cop in a city
that uses its cops like hired killers.</i>

446
00:43:18,462 --> 00:43:20,673
<i>He saved that old woman.</i>

447
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:23,467
<i>He saved those two cops.</i>

448
00:43:24,051 --> 00:43:26,470
<i>What the hell am I doing?</i>

449
00:43:37,273 --> 00:43:38,482
I just wanna know...

450
00:43:39,692 --> 00:43:43,279
...if your wife weren't pregnant,
would you...?

451
00:43:47,658 --> 00:43:50,411
I'm sorry, that wasn't a fair question.

452
00:43:51,078 --> 00:43:52,330
Damn it, Jim.

453
00:43:55,666 --> 00:43:57,919
I'll request a transfer.

454
00:44:07,428 --> 00:44:10,181
Give me Flass, I'll see that you walk.

455
00:44:10,348 --> 00:44:13,851
Try this one, how about
I don't give you Flass and walk anyway?

456
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:16,520
You got nothing on me.

457
00:44:16,687 --> 00:44:19,398
Save your little Q and A session
for the inquest, Gordon.

458
00:44:19,565 --> 00:44:21,901
My client just posted bail.

459
00:44:27,281 --> 00:44:30,534
If you say one word about Flass
and your life won't be worth a nickel.

460
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,286
Are you listening to me?

461
00:44:32,453 --> 00:44:33,537
Yeah, sure.

462
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:36,374
I want you in a blue suit with a tie.

463
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:37,833
None of that pimp stuff.

464
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,879
And when you smile at the jury,
make it nice. Particularly the women.

465
00:44:42,755 --> 00:44:44,715
You mean like this?

466
00:44:44,882 --> 00:44:48,219
Just remember,
they'll have their clothes on.

467
00:44:56,435 --> 00:44:58,062
You can never escape me.

468
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,566
Nothing harms me.

469
00:45:02,191 --> 00:45:04,026
But I know pain.

470
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:06,737
I know pain.

471
00:45:07,321 --> 00:45:12,868
Sometime I share it
with someone like you.

472
00:45:25,548 --> 00:45:27,049
You got Flass.

473
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:30,428
Get the DA
and forget to tell the commissioner.

474
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:31,846
On it.

475
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:36,183
Sources inside the police department
reveal that Detective Arnold Flass...

476
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:40,104
...has been implicated in Jefferson
Skeevers' massive drug operation.

477
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:41,355
I just need to ask you...

478
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:43,441
If I can just stop you
for just one moment.

479
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:46,402
Detective. Detective,
Vicki Vale here with the local ne...

480
00:45:46,569 --> 00:45:48,279
Detective?

481
00:45:52,742 --> 00:45:56,913
You might have informed me
before handling Flass' head to IA.

482
00:45:57,079 --> 00:45:58,623
It was a slip-up, sir.

483
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:02,418
Everyone's working such long hours.
Right, Brendon?

484
00:46:02,585 --> 00:46:05,087
You get good press, I'll give you that.

485
00:46:05,254 --> 00:46:07,798
<i>A.G. And his pack at the Gazette,
they like you.</i>

486
00:46:08,382 --> 00:46:09,842
But they don't know you.

487
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:11,761
Not like we do.

488
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:23,397
Be a shame if your wife were to learn
about your special working relationship...

489
00:46:23,564 --> 00:46:26,108
...with Detective Essen.

490
00:46:26,943 --> 00:46:29,195
Walls have ears, Jimmy.

491
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:40,289
Everything looks good, Barbara.
I'll see you in a week.

492
00:46:40,456 --> 00:46:43,000
That is unless your son
decides differently.

493
00:46:51,342 --> 00:46:53,052
Are you okay?

494
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:55,471
Yeah. Batman.

495
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:57,139
<i>Lieutenant Gordon?</i>

496
00:46:58,724 --> 00:46:59,767
Gordon here.

497
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:02,186
<i>Bruce Wayne's representative
is on the other line.</i>

498
00:47:02,603 --> 00:47:04,981
<i>Mr. Wayne's available
for an interview right now.</i>

499
00:47:05,147 --> 00:47:08,943
<i>- What should I tell him, sir?
- Tell him I'm on my way.</i>

500
00:47:09,235 --> 00:47:11,862
- Sorry, honey.
- That's okay.

501
00:47:12,029 --> 00:47:13,990
I've always wanted
to meet Bruce Wayne.

502
00:47:14,156 --> 00:47:15,658
They say he's quite charming.

503
00:47:24,083 --> 00:47:27,670
Police Lieutenant Gordon
and Mrs. Gordon, sir.

504
00:47:34,427 --> 00:47:37,221
Mrs. Gordon, I'm charmed.

505
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:41,559
Alfred, be a joy
and get some glasses for our guests.

506
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:45,521
And another bottle.
This one's evaporated.

507
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:47,732
Little early in the day for us, thanks.

508
00:47:50,401 --> 00:47:52,278
Please, sit.

509
00:47:52,445 --> 00:47:55,740
Mr. Wayne, I don't wanna waste
any more of your time than necessary.

510
00:47:55,948 --> 00:47:58,242
I've been following your exploits,
lieutenant.

511
00:47:58,409 --> 00:48:00,077
I must say I'm impressed.

512
00:48:00,244 --> 00:48:02,955
You're getting about
as much press as this Batman fellow.

513
00:48:03,497 --> 00:48:06,626
It is Batman you wanted to talk about,
isn't it?

514
00:48:07,043 --> 00:48:09,587
Something about me being him?

515
00:48:09,754 --> 00:48:11,839
Pardon me. Where are my manners?

516
00:48:12,006 --> 00:48:14,592
I neglected to introduce my friend.

517
00:48:14,759 --> 00:48:16,928
Unfortunately,
I'm not sure what her name is.

518
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,472
She doesn't speak any language
that I know.

519
00:48:19,639 --> 00:48:21,682
- Except one.
- How convenient.

520
00:48:21,849 --> 00:48:22,892
Barbara.

521
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:26,771
Mr. Wayne, I need to know
where you were on the following dates.

522
00:48:30,066 --> 00:48:32,485
- He's a pig.
- He's acting like one.

523
00:48:32,652 --> 00:48:34,946
Anyone who'd wear a cape
and hunt criminals...

524
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:37,114
...might go far to keep his secrets.

525
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:40,910
Or he really is a sleazy,
womanizing scumbag.

526
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:45,790
Jim, what is it?

527
00:48:48,459 --> 00:48:51,796
Honey,
there's something I need to tell you.

528
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:58,636
<i>He's been sitting there for 10 minutes.</i>

529
00:49:01,597 --> 00:49:04,141
<i>Ah. Now he's moving. Good.</i>

530
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:06,018
Grape juice and small talk.

531
00:49:06,185 --> 00:49:09,021
That is not my idea of a party,
Mr. Wayne.

532
00:49:09,188 --> 00:49:10,648
What are you complaining about?

533
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,608
Easiest 5 grand you ever made.

534
00:49:13,317 --> 00:49:16,153
Can I go now? You guys are weird.

535
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:22,118
Skeevers told us where, when
and how much money you received, Flass.

536
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:24,287
You're facing 10 years in prison,
my friend.

537
00:49:24,453 --> 00:49:26,956
That is if Skeevers
is alive enough to testify.

538
00:49:27,123 --> 00:49:28,833
Uh, my client didn't mean that.

539
00:49:35,673 --> 00:49:36,674
Hello?

540
00:49:36,841 --> 00:49:39,302
<i>You know
your husband's been fooling around?</i>

541
00:49:39,468 --> 00:49:41,178
Yes, I know about Detective Essen.

542
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,931
Don't bother calling here again.

543
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:58,404
Rat poison. He's lucky.

544
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:00,364
We pumped his stomach in time.

545
00:50:08,581 --> 00:50:11,542
Skeevers is still going to testify.

546
00:50:15,796 --> 00:50:18,382
Just keeping you informed, sir.

547
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:24,722
<i>In his continuing
investigation into police corruption...</i>

548
00:50:24,889 --> 00:50:26,682
<i>...District Attorney Harvey Dent...</i>

549
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:30,853
<i>...has promised a press conference early
next week to discuss the Flass case.</i>

550
00:50:31,020 --> 00:50:32,730
Lieutenant Gordon?

551
00:50:33,439 --> 00:50:36,067
It's a boy. Your wife is fine.

552
00:50:36,734 --> 00:50:40,321
<i>The city has experienced the fourth
in a daring series of cat burglaries.</i>

553
00:50:40,488 --> 00:50:43,574
<i>This time, the victim was none other
than Police Commissioner Loeb.</i>

554
00:50:43,741 --> 00:50:46,285
<i>The commissioner had a collection
of pop memorabilia.</i>

555
00:50:46,452 --> 00:50:50,623
Ugh! I thought he'd have jewels
or paintings, not these stupid toys.

556
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:52,291
How can I sell this crap?

557
00:50:52,458 --> 00:50:54,085
I don't know. They're kind of cool.

558
00:50:54,252 --> 00:50:56,921
<i>- Charge Batman with the crime
they admit to no evidence.</i>

559
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:58,256
Batman?

560
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,967
They're giving the credit to Batman?

561
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:04,929
But, Selina, you don't want them
to know it's you, do you?

562
00:51:05,596 --> 00:51:08,266
I hear Falcone's got a fortune
in old stuff.

563
00:51:08,766 --> 00:51:12,061
Maybe I'll give the Roman a little scratch
before I steal it.

564
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,105
On the face.

565
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:17,567
They won't think it's Batman
if I give him a scratch.

566
00:51:34,292 --> 00:51:37,128
<i>Hello, Johnny, my sister's boy.</i>

567
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:40,840
You're a man now, Johnny.
A strong man.

568
00:51:41,007 --> 00:51:43,676
Mother says there are several men
plaguing you, sir.

569
00:51:43,843 --> 00:51:45,928
I need only be told their names.

570
00:51:46,095 --> 00:51:48,014
Your mother is wise in her way.

571
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:49,348
You see, Johnny...

572
00:51:49,515 --> 00:51:53,477
...there are too many people in this world
who ask questions.

573
00:51:53,895 --> 00:51:57,356
And far, far too many who give answers.

574
00:51:57,523 --> 00:51:58,858
Mother said...

575
00:51:59,025 --> 00:52:00,318
Listen to me.

576
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:05,656
- We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.
- Yes, sir.

577
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:08,826
<i>- Here's what I need done.
Over there.</i>

578
00:52:22,882 --> 00:52:24,842
You work for Batman.

579
00:52:25,009 --> 00:52:26,969
I'll take care of this one.

580
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,348
Here, kitty, kitty. Ugh!

581
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:38,356
Thanks for wasting my time.

582
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,372
You made the paper again, sir.

583
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:59,001
<i>We must avoid more bad publicity, Johnny.</i>

584
00:52:59,168 --> 00:53:00,503
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

585
00:53:00,670 --> 00:53:03,422
<i>Here's what I need done.
Over there.</i>

586
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:06,425
If only that cat woman
hadn't been there.

587
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:09,845
Marked increase in paranoia. Hmm.

588
00:53:10,012 --> 00:53:12,431
The Roman says
he doesn't want bad publicity.

589
00:53:12,598 --> 00:53:14,684
It follows he won't murder anyone.

590
00:53:15,393 --> 00:53:17,186
What then? Blackmail?

591
00:53:17,353 --> 00:53:18,396
Extortion?

592
00:53:18,563 --> 00:53:22,775
Tendency toward aberrant,
even violent behavior.

593
00:53:23,484 --> 00:53:25,319
Kidnapping.

594
00:53:25,987 --> 00:53:27,738
Shall I fetch your tights, sir?

595
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,449
Never during the day, Alfred.

596
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,245
<i>Last night's attack connects
Batman to the recent string of burglaries.</i>

597
00:53:34,412 --> 00:53:37,123
<i>A woman in a cat costume,
presumably Batman's assistant...</i>

598
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:39,250
<i>- Assistant?
... left before police arrived.</i>

599
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:41,419
<i>- Now I'm his assistant?
In other news...</i>

600
00:53:44,297 --> 00:53:46,507
You're going to need your rest.

601
00:53:56,726 --> 00:53:58,561
All bets are off.

602
00:53:58,728 --> 00:53:59,896
You understand?

603
00:54:00,313 --> 00:54:01,606
Tell me what to do.

604
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,608
Gordon, Johnny.

605
00:54:04,025 --> 00:54:06,903
Not gonna be easy.
He'll be hard to get to.

606
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,947
Then make him come to you.

607
00:54:11,532 --> 00:54:17,705
Once a man becomes a father,
he is never truly free.

608
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:30,426
Feeding time.

609
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:33,804
My turn.

610
00:54:37,225 --> 00:54:39,352
Easy now. Almost warm.

611
00:54:43,981 --> 00:54:45,483
<i>- Gordon here.
Get down here.</i>

612
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:47,902
Sir, Merkel's on duty, can't you...?

613
00:54:48,069 --> 00:54:50,571
Yes, sir. On my way.

614
00:54:53,241 --> 00:54:54,992
Gordon is leaving his apartment.

615
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:56,953
Tell Falcone.

616
00:55:19,475 --> 00:55:20,560
Whoa!

617
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:24,021
Maniac.

618
00:55:56,512 --> 00:55:57,972
Drop the gun, lieutenant.

619
00:55:58,139 --> 00:56:01,183
Go to your office, wait for our call.

620
00:56:01,350 --> 00:56:03,352
- Jim.
- You heard him, lieutenant.

621
00:56:03,519 --> 00:56:05,104
Drop the gun.

622
00:56:05,271 --> 00:56:09,525
<i>If I let them go,
my wife and son are dead.</i>

623
00:56:11,277 --> 00:56:13,654
The son of a bitch is crazy.

624
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:29,420
Barbara, get out of here. Call Merkel.

625
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:41,432
Don't move. I'll shoot, I will.

626
00:56:41,933 --> 00:56:44,769
Mrs. Gordon, I won't let your son die.

627
00:56:45,603 --> 00:56:47,271
Trust me.

628
00:58:57,485 --> 00:58:59,403
No!

629
00:59:20,716 --> 00:59:23,219
You must be wearing armor
under that jacket.

630
00:59:24,095 --> 00:59:25,596
Something like that.

631
00:59:26,013 --> 00:59:29,100
You know, I'm practically blind
