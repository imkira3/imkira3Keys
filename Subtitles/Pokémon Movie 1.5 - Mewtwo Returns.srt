1
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:10,049
<i>I am Mewtwo.</i>

2
00:00:11,256 --> 00:00:13,451
<i>I am unlike other Pokémon.</i>

3
00:00:14,493 --> 00:00:16,518
<i>This is my story.</i>

4
00:00:17,863 --> 00:00:22,493
<i>A team of scientists working to create</i>
<i>the world's most powerful Pokémon...</i>

5
00:00:23,068 --> 00:00:25,628
<i>... discovered a fossilized remnant of Mew...</i>

6
00:00:26,405 --> 00:00:29,067
<i>... and from it created me.</i>

7
00:00:31,944 --> 00:00:34,469
Radio Giovanni's helicopter.
Tell him what's happened!

8
00:00:34,546 --> 00:00:35,376
Quiet!

9
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:38,244
Let us hear its psychic powers.

10
00:00:43,722 --> 00:00:47,488
<i>Soon the Team Rocket leader,</i>
<i>who had ordered my creation...</i>

11
00:00:48,093 --> 00:00:50,653
<i>... trained me to control my abilities.</i>

12
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:55,733
<i>But he viewed me solely</i>
<i>as his personal property.</i>

13
00:00:56,201 --> 00:00:58,999
You were created by humans
to obey humans.

14
00:00:59,404 --> 00:01:02,134
<i>I was not born a Pokémon, I was created.</i>

15
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:05,008
<i>And my creators have used</i>
<i>and betrayed me.</i>

16
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,035
<i>So, I stand alone!</i>

17
00:01:10,215 --> 00:01:14,083
<i>After destroying his laboratory,</i>
<i>I created my own.</i>

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,317
<i>I lured Pokémon trainers</i>
<i>to my island fortress to create...</i>

19
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:22,349
<i>... a powerful new breed of Pokémon</i>
<i>and wreak vengeance on humans.</i>

20
00:01:22,661 --> 00:01:27,360
<i>I seized their Pokémon and cloned them,</i>
<i>as I had been cloned from Mew.</i>

21
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:31,336
<i>But soon, I encountered my nemesis.</i>

22
00:01:33,805 --> 00:01:35,329
<i>A great battle ensued.</i>

23
00:01:35,474 --> 00:01:39,535
<i>A battle to determine who would rule:</i>
<i>The Pokémon born into this world...</i>

24
00:01:39,645 --> 00:01:42,443
<i>... or the cloned Pokémon created in mine.</i>

25
00:01:42,814 --> 00:01:44,247
<i>The clashes were brutal.</i>

26
00:01:44,483 --> 00:01:48,920
<i>And as Mew and I summoned</i>
<i>all our strength for a final confrontation...</i>

27
00:01:49,354 --> 00:01:52,653
<i>... the young trainer cried out</i>
<i>for the fighting to cease.</i>

28
00:01:53,425 --> 00:01:54,585
Stop!

29
00:01:56,294 --> 00:01:58,626
<i>His selfless actions puzzled me.</i>

30
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:03,724
<i>He was a human who valued all Pokémon,</i>
<i>whether born or created.</i>

31
00:02:04,569 --> 00:02:05,968
<i>Our battling ceased.</i>

32
00:02:06,438 --> 00:02:08,804
<i>Finally, my eyes had been opened...</i>

33
00:02:09,408 --> 00:02:10,841
<i>... as had my heart.</i>

34
00:02:11,309 --> 00:02:16,008
<i>The Pokémon clones and I left</i>
<i>to find a place to live in peace...</i>

35
00:02:16,481 --> 00:02:20,815
<i>... and I used my psychic powers</i>
<i>to wipe out the memory of our struggle.</i>

36
00:02:21,486 --> 00:02:24,944
<i>Now I am forgotten by all</i>
<i>but the one who created me...</i>

37
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,483
<i>... the one whose desire</i>
<i>to control me still burns.</i>

38
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:39,632
These are live satellite pictures
of a remote area of the Johto region.

39
00:02:40,238 --> 00:02:43,799
Extreme weather makes it uninhabitable
for people.

40
00:02:44,476 --> 00:02:46,137
But keep watching.

41
00:02:52,117 --> 00:02:53,709
I've found you.

42
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:06,128
<i>This place is beautiful.</i>

43
00:03:07,432 --> 00:03:09,627
<i>But what right have I to judge?</i>

44
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:13,269
<i>What do I know of this world</i>
<i>and its beauty?</i>

45
00:03:14,106 --> 00:03:16,438
<i>I am not like other creatures.</i>

46
00:03:17,442 --> 00:03:20,104
<i>I am not of this world.</i>

47
00:03:21,813 --> 00:03:25,305
<i>We are clones, copies...</i>

48
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:27,874
<i>... products of science.</i>

49
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:31,314
<i>We are outcasts.</i>

50
00:03:33,525 --> 00:03:36,323
<i>So we must live as outcasts...</i>

51
00:03:36,928 --> 00:03:39,362
<i>... if we are to live at all.</i>

52
00:03:40,465 --> 00:03:44,401
<i>We shall stay here, far from the world...</i>

53
00:03:45,637 --> 00:03:47,400
<i>... far from man.</i>

54
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,905
<i>It is our only hope.</i>

55
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:56,570
<i>For if we do not live in secret,</i>
<i>we shall never live in peace.</i>

56
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:25,874
<i>Today, Ash and his friends</i>
<i>begin an unforgettable adventure...</i>

57
00:04:26,011 --> 00:04:30,948
<i>... as they approach an intriguing landmark</i>
<i>in the far reaches of the Johto region.</i>

58
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:37,052
- That must <i>be...</i>
- Must be!

59
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,023
That's it all right: Purity Canyon,
the Johto region's greatest natural wonder.

60
00:04:43,395 --> 00:04:44,987
Yeah, no wonder.

61
00:04:45,263 --> 00:04:49,324
- Wonder how we get across it?
- The book says it's impossible on foot.

62
00:04:49,401 --> 00:04:53,394
The only way to get across is by bus,
but it only makes the trip once a month.

63
00:04:53,738 --> 00:04:56,002
- When does it leave?
- Lunchtime today.

64
00:04:56,274 --> 00:04:58,003
Too bad we won't be able to go.

65
00:04:58,076 --> 00:05:00,271
Why not? We still have time to make it.

66
00:05:00,345 --> 00:05:01,175
I know.

67
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:05,977
But I've been planning to try a new recipe
and make spicy pizza pancakes for lunch.

68
00:05:06,051 --> 00:05:06,983
Really?

69
00:05:07,485 --> 00:05:08,383
Look.

70
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,380
That must be the bus down there!

71
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,355
I guess so.

72
00:05:14,092 --> 00:05:16,390
Come on! Maybe we can catch it.

73
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:24,929
Oh, no, it's raining!

74
00:05:26,938 --> 00:05:31,875
I know, I'll use my trusty frying pan
as a drying pan.

75
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,645
Look at those twerps running in the rain.

76
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:39,775
Imagine coming to Purity Canyon
and not having the foresight...

77
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,217
...to bring shelter from the storms.

78
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:45,185
It's a good thing I packed this umbrella.

79
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:49,054
Yeah, but what will we do
when the bad weather hits?

80
00:05:49,294 --> 00:05:51,762
This is bad weather.
What are you talking about?

81
00:05:51,963 --> 00:05:54,830
- I'm talking about typhoons.
- Typhoons?

82
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:58,561
According to the guidebook,
''The unique geologic formations...

83
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,162
<i>''...and</i> atmospheric conditions
at Purity Canyon...

84
00:06:01,239 --> 00:06:03,400
''...create severe
and unpredictable weather.

85
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:06,638
''Because blizzards,
thunderstorms and typhoons are likely...

86
00:06:06,845 --> 00:06:09,313
<i>''...we</i> advise tourists to avoid this <i>area.''</i>

87
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:13,181
I don't believe a word of it.
Those guides sensationalize everything.

88
00:06:13,852 --> 00:06:15,444
Hey, what's that sound?

89
00:06:18,423 --> 00:06:21,256
How many times
must our plans be destroyed?

90
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:23,724
Before they're allowed to be tried.

91
00:06:23,795 --> 00:06:26,263
''The answer, my friends,
is blowin' in the <i>wind.''</i>

92
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,322
We're blasting off again!

93
00:06:35,373 --> 00:06:38,570
There don't seem to be any more
passengers for this month's trip.

94
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:43,180
I know it's a little early to leave,
but the bus is full and the weather's bad.

95
00:06:43,815 --> 00:06:45,942
It sure is. We'd better get going.

96
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:49,042
'Bye.

97
00:06:50,121 --> 00:06:52,021
Hey, wait for us!

98
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,559
Are you okay?

99
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:05,563
Yeah.
Does the bus to Purity Canyon stop here?

100
00:07:05,737 --> 00:07:07,864
Yes, it does, but you just missed it.

101
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:13,241
Forget the bus. If you want to stay dry
there's room under my pan, if we get close.

102
00:07:14,746 --> 00:07:17,613
- I can smell what you're cooking up.
- Not the ear.

103
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:20,079
There's gotta be a way to catch that bus.

104
00:07:20,352 --> 00:07:22,217
Not when the weather gets like this.

105
00:07:22,287 --> 00:07:26,485
The wind and rain are treacherous here,
and the roads can get very dangerous.

106
00:07:26,558 --> 00:07:30,050
It's hard enough to make it by bus.
On foot, you don't have a chance.

107
00:07:30,528 --> 00:07:33,156
Why don't we all get out of this rain?

108
00:08:08,266 --> 00:08:11,030
- This is some kind of a miracle.
- I can't believe it.

109
00:08:11,369 --> 00:08:13,530
How could this happen?

110
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,240
<i>You ask why I saved those humans?</i>

111
00:08:26,518 --> 00:08:28,315
<i>For our own protection.</i>

112
00:08:28,753 --> 00:08:31,278
<i>An accident would bring human rescuers.</i>

113
00:08:31,356 --> 00:08:34,382
<i>We might be discovered</i>
<i>and our peace disrupted.</i>

114
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:39,390
<i>You believe there is another reason?</i>

115
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:44,193
<i>That I felt concern</i>
<i>or cared about the safety of those humans?</i>

116
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:49,299
<i>I assure you that was not the case.</i>

117
00:08:50,475 --> 00:08:53,603
<i>I could never feel compassion for humans.</i>

118
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,747
Good thing we had the umbrella.

119
00:08:59,818 --> 00:09:01,649
If it wasn't for the umbrella...

120
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,584
We'd be out on a limb.

121
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:12,162
The company that runs the buses
built this lodge about 10 years ago.

122
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:15,722
People who miss the bus stay here
until the next one comes in a month.

123
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:17,596
We can't stay here a month.

124
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:20,001
Isn't there another way
to get across the valley?

125
00:09:20,071 --> 00:09:24,667
You could take a boat down Purity River
in the canyon and get across that way.

126
00:09:24,776 --> 00:09:26,710
I'd love to take a boat ride, Luna.

127
00:09:26,778 --> 00:09:29,747
My family runs a water Pokémon gym,
and I just love the water.

128
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:33,313
Well, if you love water,
you came to the right place.

129
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,105
Have a drink, Brock.

130
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:04,137
This water is absolutely delicious!

131
00:10:04,349 --> 00:10:07,910
This is the most devastatingly
delicious drink I've ever encountered!

132
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,913
Hey, I wanna try some, too.

133
00:10:14,592 --> 00:10:17,652
It makes me feel refreshingly alive
and tingly.

134
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,755
I guess it's good,
but how good can water be?

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,332
Here, take a taste and find out.

136
00:10:28,173 --> 00:10:31,472
If you ask me, it tastes
like something's been swimming in it.

137
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,738
We should've known better
than to ask you.

138
00:10:33,811 --> 00:10:35,506
You know what your problem is?

139
00:10:35,713 --> 00:10:37,408
You have no taste.

140
00:10:37,482 --> 00:10:40,076
Well, maybe I don't,
but neither does this water!

141
00:10:40,151 --> 00:10:42,244
Pikachu, try some of this.

142
00:10:51,796 --> 00:10:55,254
Looks like four out of five water drinkers
prefer Purity River water.

143
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,595
Guess so.

144
00:10:57,268 --> 00:11:00,965
I can hardly wait to ride on a river
that's this super pure and clean.

145
00:11:01,105 --> 00:11:03,005
Come on, guys, let's go!

146
00:11:10,648 --> 00:11:12,741
I'm kind of glad we missed the bus.

147
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:15,684
The current's doing the work
and the water's crystal clear.

148
00:11:15,753 --> 00:11:20,520
It's fine with me but I wouldn't be so happy
about this nice clean water if I were you.

149
00:11:21,292 --> 00:11:23,522
I know how much you hate Bug Pokémon.

150
00:11:23,695 --> 00:11:27,028
And nice clean water is
just what Bug Pokémon love.

151
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:31,730
That's just fine because this is one time
I'm not gonna let Bug Pokémon bug me.

152
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,039
- Whatever you say.
- I say, bring on the Bugs!

153
00:11:35,173 --> 00:11:36,970
Hey, look there.

154
00:11:37,041 --> 00:11:38,838
It's a Christmas tree.

155
00:11:39,143 --> 00:11:41,771
That's no Christmas tree. Is it, Brock?

156
00:11:42,146 --> 00:11:45,946
Not quite. That's a flock of Ledian.
Ledian are Bug Pokémon.

157
00:11:46,284 --> 00:11:48,582
They glow like that on clear, starry nights.

158
00:11:48,653 --> 00:11:52,555
Ledian, huh? You know, guys,
I think I'm starting to like Bugs.

159
00:11:53,925 --> 00:11:55,392
These are cool Kakuna.

160
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:58,258
I wouldn't be surprised
to see a bunch of Beedrill, too.

161
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,196
With this many Kakuna,
there's gotta be some around.

162
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,074
You should've mentioned
you don't like Bug Pokémon.

163
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:19,082
Sorry, next time you'll know.

164
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,175
Is there another way across the valley?

165
00:12:21,286 --> 00:12:22,776
I know there's one.

166
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:24,618
There.

167
00:12:26,824 --> 00:12:29,349
We can go straight over the top
of Mt. Quena.

168
00:12:30,161 --> 00:12:33,153
I don't think you wanna take that route.

169
00:12:33,364 --> 00:12:35,264
Why, is it too hard to get up there?

170
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,301
Mt. Quena is the highest mountain
in the whole Johto region.

171
00:12:39,003 --> 00:12:41,437
At the top of the mountain is Clarity Lake.

172
00:12:41,506 --> 00:12:46,034
It goes on for miles and miles,
and the water is incredibly clean and clear.

173
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,375
It's beautiful,
but humans could never live there.

174
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:53,208
The height of the mountain
and the weather even keep visitors away.

175
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:56,879
The only ones that live up there
are some wild Pokémon...

176
00:12:56,954 --> 00:13:00,117
...types that can thrive
in the extreme conditions.

177
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:03,916
Well, if there are Pokémon up there,
I say we go.

178
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:06,589
What's that?

179
00:13:14,138 --> 00:13:16,231
It's a flock of Butterfree.

180
00:13:16,974 --> 00:13:20,341
Some people say the Butterfree
come to lay their eggs on Mt. Quena.

181
00:13:24,749 --> 00:13:28,082
<i>For these Pokémon, life is as it should be.</i>

182
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:33,247
<i>They were born into this world.</i>
<i>It is their home. They belong here.</i>

183
00:13:34,759 --> 00:13:37,421
<i>We were not born as they were.</i>

184
00:13:37,829 --> 00:13:42,129
<i>We are not of this world.</i>
<i>We do not belong in it.</i>

185
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:45,297
<i>But where do we belong?</i>

186
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,972
<i>Do we truly deserve to live here</i>
<i>as much as the other Pokémon do?</i>

187
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:56,074
<i>We are unlike the others.</i>

188
00:13:58,916 --> 00:13:59,905
<i>Yes.</i>

189
00:14:00,118 --> 00:14:04,054
<i>I am sure the moon is round</i>
<i>and bright to those Butterfree...</i>

190
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:08,216
<i>... just as it is to us</i>
<i>and any other Pokémon who sees it.</i>

191
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:13,928
<i>If we see the moon as they do...</i>

192
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:17,263
<i>... why can't we see the Earth as they do?</i>

193
00:14:18,536 --> 00:14:20,731
<i>Yes. Why?</i>

194
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:32,074
I sure would like to see the place
those Butterfree are headed.

195
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:34,409
Good morning.

196
00:14:34,886 --> 00:14:35,853
Hello?

197
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,547
- A visitor?
- At this hour?

198
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:44,520
I said ''good <i>morning''</i>
'cause even though it's after midnight...

199
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:46,859
...if I said ''good <i>night''</i>
you might go to bed.

200
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:50,800
We hate to bother you,
but we've been exploring...

201
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:52,597
...and we need a place to stay.

202
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,900
By the way, my name is Cullen Calix.

203
00:14:55,406 --> 00:14:56,532
I know that name.

204
00:14:56,607 --> 00:14:59,269
You're the famous researcher
and professor of medicine.

205
00:14:59,477 --> 00:15:02,503
Yes, and if my guess is correct,
you're Luna Carson.

206
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,572
I've read dozens of your research papers
on Pokémon.

207
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,281
It's a pleasure to finally meet you
in person.

208
00:15:08,419 --> 00:15:09,613
Please, come in.

209
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,312
Research papers?

210
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:16,592
Working for the bus company
is my part-time job.

211
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:19,925
I'm actually here observing native Pokémon
and their habitats.

212
00:15:20,198 --> 00:15:23,565
I can't believe I'm finally meeting
''the'' Luna Carson.

213
00:15:23,634 --> 00:15:27,866
I'm a total fan of yours.
I wanna be exactly like you when I get old.

214
00:15:29,106 --> 00:15:31,370
Great. And you are who?

215
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:34,238
This is Domino.
She works for the Pokémon Institute.

216
00:15:34,378 --> 00:15:35,436
Hi, everybody!

217
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:39,950
Domino, what a beautiful name.
So black and white, yet so playful.

218
00:15:40,651 --> 00:15:44,553
Please, let's find a quiet spot to line up
and find out if we're a match.

219
00:15:44,989 --> 00:15:49,153
Haven't you learned by now
that you shouldn't play if you can't win?

220
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:53,157
I'm afraid I have some bad news:
The bus won't be back for another month.

221
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:57,131
I didn't come here to take the bus.
I came to study the water.

222
00:15:57,535 --> 00:15:58,763
- The water?
- Yes.

223
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,236
I've been studying Purity River
for some time...

224
00:16:01,305 --> 00:16:04,502
...and I've discovered
that its water contains rare minerals...

225
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:09,012
...that have an amazing effect on the health
of both Pokémon and human volunteers.

226
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:11,572
Here's a sample I took today.

227
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:16,815
I've come here to explore Mt. Quena
and unravel the secret of this water.

228
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:18,279
That's too bad.

229
00:16:19,056 --> 00:16:22,617
If the water does heal people
they'll come here from all over the world.

230
00:16:22,693 --> 00:16:26,493
Thousands of visitors will start coming
to Mt. Quena and Purity Canyon.

231
00:16:26,797 --> 00:16:30,563
They might accidentally destroy
the very thing they're looking for.

232
00:16:30,868 --> 00:16:32,096
I see what you mean.

233
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:36,102
Then again,
Mt. Quena is almost impossible to get to.

234
00:16:41,546 --> 00:16:44,014
Hard, but we're prepared for trouble.

235
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:46,140
We'll scale that mountain on the double.

236
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,318
To protect the world from devastation.

237
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,952
To unite all peoples within our nation.

238
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:54,085
To denounce the evils of truth and love.

239
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:57,255
To extend our reach to the stars above.

240
00:16:57,795 --> 00:16:59,285
- Jessie!
- James!

241
00:16:59,664 --> 00:17:02,565
Team Rocket blasting off
at the speed of light!

242
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,762
Surrender now or prepare to fight.

243
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,401
Meowth, that's right.

244
00:17:07,505 --> 00:17:08,665
What do you want?

245
00:17:09,707 --> 00:17:11,937
<i>I don't remember these clowns.</i>

246
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:14,602
Today's the day we capture Pikachu.

247
00:17:14,779 --> 00:17:16,110
You never will!

248
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:20,882
Don't bet on it, brat-o.
Go electricity-absorbing wire!

249
00:17:23,988 --> 00:17:25,114
Pikachu!

250
00:17:25,389 --> 00:17:27,687
You may as well conserve your energy.

251
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:31,421
You can't shock us now that we've got
your power plant on-line.

252
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:36,790
We knew we'd need cable
to absorb his attacks...

253
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:39,233
...so we planned things
right down to the wire.

254
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,203
Now it's time for our getaway.

255
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:49,879
We burst that thing before
and we'll do it again!

256
00:17:51,015 --> 00:17:53,483
You may have done it before,
but not anymore.

257
00:17:56,854 --> 00:18:00,346
We've always had the team,
but now we've finally got the rockets.

258
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:02,420
<i>They're embarrassing.</i>

259
00:18:02,526 --> 00:18:05,620
You can't go. The air currents
in this valley are treacherous.

260
00:18:05,696 --> 00:18:08,426
If you launch that rocket,
we might never see you again.

261
00:18:08,566 --> 00:18:12,366
Finally, a man with intelligence,
intensity and ruggedly attractive stubble...

262
00:18:12,436 --> 00:18:14,131
...cares about me passionately.

263
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:17,741
What could this strange sensation be?
It must be love.

264
00:18:17,908 --> 00:18:21,935
But our love can never be.
I have given my heart to Team Rocket.

265
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:24,975
Please, don't try to beg. I must leave you.

266
00:18:25,182 --> 00:18:28,640
When it comes to romance,
she's got a pretty vivid imagination.

267
00:18:28,719 --> 00:18:30,380
And that's all she's got.

268
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,279
I'm not finished yet!

269
00:18:32,423 --> 00:18:34,050
Now we must go our separate ways...

270
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,060
...but I hope when you think of me,
as you certainly will...

271
00:18:37,128 --> 00:18:39,858
...remember that there is
something good in ''goodbye.''

272
00:18:44,602 --> 00:18:45,694
Pikachu!

273
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:47,669
Farewell, my love.

274
00:18:47,805 --> 00:18:52,299
This unfeeling rocket now carries me away
towards the pale and heartless moon.

275
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:56,207
- I don't see no moon.
- It was there a second ago.

276
00:18:57,515 --> 00:18:59,107
The weather's changing again.

277
00:18:59,183 --> 00:19:02,084
Taking off in a balloon like that
is careless and reckless.

278
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:04,087
You forgot to mention brainless.

279
00:19:04,155 --> 00:19:06,885
If they get away,
I might never see Pikachu again.

280
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:15,726
I have to follow Team Rocket,
no matter what.

281
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:17,866
Well, if that's the <i>case...</i>

282
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:30,280
I know Mt. Quena pretty well
and I'll lead you up there.

283
00:19:30,347 --> 00:19:31,746
I'm ready when you are.

284
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,577
We're ready, Luna.

285
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:35,479
And I'm ready, too.

286
00:19:47,465 --> 00:19:49,296
This is so scary.

287
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,392
You knew this would be tough.
You should've stayed at the lodge.

288
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,904
Staying there alone
would've been even scarier.

289
00:20:01,078 --> 00:20:02,978
- Domino!
- Here I am.

290
00:20:04,548 --> 00:20:07,915
I'm pretty lucky.
That big rock missed me by an inch.

291
00:20:20,965 --> 00:20:23,900
With all these updrafts and downdrafts
and sideways drafts...

292
00:20:23,968 --> 00:20:25,595
...we're not getting anywhere.

293
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,159
Do you think we're in danger?

294
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:30,674
As long as we got them rockets,
I'm sure we'll be okay.

295
00:20:38,449 --> 00:20:39,939
It's getting windy.

296
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:45,154
There goes Team Rocket.
Hey, come back here!

297
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,023
Look out, it's heading right this way!

298
00:21:05,476 --> 00:21:08,639
With all of them hanging on,
we're never gonna get away.

299
00:21:09,814 --> 00:21:12,647
You're gonna drag us down,
you lightweight. Return!

300
00:21:19,757 --> 00:21:21,281
The wind just stopped.

301
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:26,158
<i>The storm is over for now.</i>

302
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:32,235
- A gigantic lake.
- And look at that island.

303
00:21:41,512 --> 00:21:43,104
I think I see...

304
00:21:44,982 --> 00:21:46,779
...just what we're looking for.

305
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,156
<i>It's definitely Mewtwo.</i>

306
00:21:54,825 --> 00:21:58,693
You got away from me once.
It won't happen again, my friend.

307
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,669
<i>Those children again.</i>

308
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:15,369
<i>Can this be an accident,</i>
<i>or is it something more?</i>

309
00:22:21,051 --> 00:22:26,216
<i>Now we will find out once and for all</i>
<i>whose will is stronger.</i>

310
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,768
Well, what's this?

311
00:22:46,243 --> 00:22:49,701
<i>I've spotted Pokémon with bio-prints</i>
<i>similar to Mewtwo's.</i>

312
00:22:50,047 --> 00:22:52,811
That doesn't surprise me.
It's natural that Mewtwo...

313
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:57,286
...should want to be with its own kind,
no matter how unnatural they may be.

314
00:22:57,888 --> 00:23:00,356
<i>009, begin operations at once.</i>

315
00:23:01,091 --> 00:23:02,752
Copy. Over and out.

316
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:13,995
Who are you?

317
00:23:14,071 --> 00:23:18,235
009 to Team Rocket Combat Unit leaders.
Proceed to coordinates.

318
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:21,401
- The Team Rocket Combat Unit?
- They're here?

319
00:23:21,478 --> 00:23:22,445
Where?

320
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:33,947
- There they are.
- Pretty impressive.

321
00:23:34,024 --> 00:23:35,924
Where are the Meowth head balloons?

322
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:40,620
Now we've got you.

323
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:43,590
Domino, what are you doing?

324
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:46,133
- Domino?
- Is that your real name?

325
00:23:46,203 --> 00:23:50,139
I don't reveal my true identity.
That's a secret I keep to myself.

326
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,038
Things are simpler that way.

327
00:23:52,309 --> 00:23:56,939
But, within the elite ranks of Team Rocket,
I have an identity that is known to all.

328
00:24:00,951 --> 00:24:04,478
My fellow agents
know me as 009, Domino...

329
00:24:04,555 --> 00:24:08,514
...but my adversaries know me
as simply the Black Tulip.

330
00:24:08,592 --> 00:24:12,255
Black Tulip? You told me you worked
for the Pokémon Institute.

331
00:24:12,429 --> 00:24:15,557
I do, but Team Rocket
has agents working everywhere.

332
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:21,166
You never know. It may look innocent, but
a friendly face may hide our fiercest foe.

333
00:24:21,238 --> 00:24:23,832
- Look at our faces.
- They're friendly.

334
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:24,965
And foe-y.

335
00:24:25,175 --> 00:24:27,336
All I see are the faces of losers.

336
00:24:28,112 --> 00:24:30,012
Here's a little souvenir.

337
00:24:35,886 --> 00:24:38,218
'Bye. Nice to see you go.

338
00:25:07,317 --> 00:25:09,979
Do either of you think
it might be a good idea...

339
00:25:10,054 --> 00:25:14,889
...to explore the possibility of utilizing
an alternate means of transportation?

340
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:16,285
Not really.

341
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:19,691
At least this time,
we finally captured the twerps' Pikachu.

342
00:25:19,763 --> 00:25:21,492
That's certainly progress.

343
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:25,802
It must have got loose
when the balloon crash-landed.

344
00:25:25,869 --> 00:25:27,769
Now it's just standing there.

345
00:25:30,474 --> 00:25:33,136
- Why's it sparking like that?
- Maybe it wants to play!

346
00:25:43,754 --> 00:25:46,689
- It went easy on us that time.
- I wonder why.

347
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:50,155
- Pikachu <i>and...</i>
- Pikachu!

348
00:25:57,267 --> 00:26:00,031
- What are they saying, Meowth?
- That one up there said:

349
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:01,401
''So, we meet <i>again.''</i>

350
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:03,497
- They know each other?
- I don't know.

351
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:06,574
The one on the hill sure knows
the twerps' Pikachu.

352
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:14,149
It ain't happy. It's saying, ''You shouldn't
have come here. This place is <i>ours.''</i>

353
00:26:17,454 --> 00:26:20,150
It said, ''We came here to make a home
and live in peace...

354
00:26:20,224 --> 00:26:23,682
<i>''...but</i> you brought humans,
and they're the last things Pokémon need...

355
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,523
''...especially clone <i>Pokémon.''</i>

356
00:26:26,063 --> 00:26:28,224
I never saw a clone Pokémon before.

357
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:29,729
Wonder what they are.

358
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:35,200
The twerps' Pikachu doesn't know
what they are either.

359
00:26:37,374 --> 00:26:39,569
''Get out, or you'll regret it! <i>''</i>

360
00:26:40,711 --> 00:26:42,406
Looks like they're about to battle.

361
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:45,778
Pikachu versus Pikachu?
This could be the match of the year.

362
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:56,425
<i>No. Fighting is senseless.</i>

363
00:27:14,912 --> 00:27:17,710
<i>There is nothing to be gained</i>
<i>from such battling.</i>

364
00:27:17,981 --> 00:27:22,816
<i>You are the same as the other Pokémon,</i>
<i>neither stronger nor weaker.</i>

365
00:27:23,153 --> 00:27:26,611
<i>You proved that the last time we met</i>
<i>and battled the Pokémon...</i>

366
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:28,590
<i>... from which we were copied.</i>

367
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:37,324
- This is awfully confusing.
- This is like the sequel to a movie I missed.

368
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:42,796
Don't mind us.
We're looking for a balloon repair shop.

369
00:27:43,173 --> 00:27:46,370
<i>I've searched for a place</i>
<i>to live in secret and in peace.</i>

370
00:27:46,610 --> 00:27:48,874
<i>Now these humans have found us again.</i>

371
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:52,175
<i>Perhaps we shall never find peace.</i>

372
00:27:55,118 --> 00:27:57,746
I know you're psychic,
but have we met before?

373
00:27:58,722 --> 00:28:01,418
It's saying their only choice
is to stand their ground.

374
00:28:01,491 --> 00:28:04,324
If they don't,
their home will get taken away from them.

375
00:28:04,394 --> 00:28:05,554
They gotta battle.

376
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:14,966
''This has gotta be more than a <i>battle''?</i>
''This is <i>war''?</i>

377
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:16,905
What did I get into?

378
00:28:22,546 --> 00:28:26,607
Pikachu's right. There's no reason
for you Pokémon to fight us Pokémon.

379
00:28:29,653 --> 00:28:31,553
Yeah, it is a full moon.

380
00:28:32,489 --> 00:28:34,218
Sure is pretty.

381
00:28:36,193 --> 00:28:38,855
<i>The moon reflects the light of the sun.</i>

382
00:28:39,396 --> 00:28:43,389
<i>Pokémon born into this world</i>
<i>may walk freely in that sun.</i>

383
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:48,267
<i>But we were created. Reflections.</i>
<i>We are shadows.</i>

384
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:51,766
<i>Perhaps we should not live in sunlight...</i>

385
00:28:51,975 --> 00:28:54,205
<i>... but in the shadows of moonlight.</i>

386
00:28:54,811 --> 00:28:57,109
The moon looks awful bright tonight.

387
00:29:01,652 --> 00:29:04,883
It's saying that it ain't fair
that they have to live like shadows.

388
00:29:07,924 --> 00:29:12,327
''This place is beautiful.
But beyond this place, there's a big world.

389
00:29:15,265 --> 00:29:16,562
<i>''A</i> bright world.

390
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,541
''You know that world, don't you?
You were born in it...

391
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:03,807
<i>''...and</i> you can live in it,
any way and anywhere you want.

392
00:30:08,785 --> 00:30:12,346
''But because of what we are,
we can't live in that world like you do.

393
00:30:15,926 --> 00:30:20,090
''Whatever we do or wherever we go,
we don't <i>belong.''</i>

394
00:30:20,764 --> 00:30:22,288
I know that feeling.

395
00:30:22,366 --> 00:30:26,598
Ever since I was a little girl,
the world's always treated me as a misfit.

396
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,366
As an outcast.
As someone who doesn't really belong.

397
00:30:29,439 --> 00:30:32,101
- Prepare for trouble.
- And make it double.

398
00:30:32,309 --> 00:30:35,767
We unite all peoples,
we extend our reach, we blast off.

399
00:30:36,213 --> 00:30:38,807
So, surrender now or prepare to fight.

400
00:30:39,015 --> 00:30:40,380
Meowth, <i>that's...</i>

401
00:30:42,652 --> 00:30:43,641
<i>Enough.</i>

402
00:30:44,521 --> 00:30:46,079
<i>We are what we are.</i>

403
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:50,652
<i>We will remain here, and live in peace.</i>

404
00:30:52,195 --> 00:30:53,526
<i>If we can.</i>

405
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:01,860
Prepare, my old friend.

406
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:04,799
For at sunrise, we will meet again.

407
00:31:08,478 --> 00:31:11,311
- Is everybody okay?
- I'm all right.

408
00:31:11,848 --> 00:31:13,315
Togepi's fine, too.

409
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:18,481
I won't be fine.
Not until I see Pikachu again.

410
00:31:21,057 --> 00:31:23,685
Team Rocket's balloon
was headed for that island, Ash.

411
00:31:24,461 --> 00:31:26,895
- Then that's where I'm going.
- Ash, wait.

412
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,827
I have an idea.
See that giant tree trunk lying over there?

413
00:31:31,268 --> 00:31:33,930
- We'll build a canoe out of it.
- A canoe?

414
00:31:34,171 --> 00:31:36,639
Sure. And we can use our Pokémon
to help.

415
00:31:36,807 --> 00:31:38,775
Let's get started.

416
00:31:39,142 --> 00:31:42,805
Chikorita, Bulbasaur, I choose you.

417
00:31:44,548 --> 00:31:47,449
Okay. Let's see
if you can make that log a canoe.

418
00:32:05,235 --> 00:32:08,602
We can't let them see us here.
The quicker we get there, the better.

419
00:32:10,273 --> 00:32:14,141
<i>If the humans will not leave us in peace,</i>
<i>so be it.</i>

420
00:32:14,811 --> 00:32:17,678
<i>We will leave this place</i>
<i>and search for another.</i>

421
00:32:18,482 --> 00:32:22,248
<i>We will continue to search</i>
<i>until we find a place to live...</i>

422
00:32:23,153 --> 00:32:25,246
<i>... and to belong.</i>

423
00:32:27,457 --> 00:32:29,482
The Combat Squad will rescue us.

424
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:31,888
- I certainly hope not.
- Why?

425
00:32:32,262 --> 00:32:36,221
Do you want the boss to see us
in another humiliating situation?

426
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:41,025
Pipe down. The other Pikachu
wants to say something important.

427
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:47,367
It said, ''lf we don't get out of here...

428
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:50,743
''...they're gonna catch us and use us
in Pokémon cloning experiments.

429
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:56,677
''Just because we're clones don't mean
they can treat us any way they want.

430
00:33:01,591 --> 00:33:04,719
<i>''I</i> say we leave this place
and go wherever we please! <i>''</i>

431
00:33:05,195 --> 00:33:07,663
That's great news.
Ask them to bring us, too.

432
00:33:07,731 --> 00:33:09,631
We'll be glad to go anywhere.

433
00:33:11,768 --> 00:33:15,966
- They didn't say we were going to prison.
- Next time we use a travel agent.

434
00:33:16,139 --> 00:33:17,731
You humans are all alike.

435
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:21,208
What do you expect them to do,
invite Team Rocket along for the ride?

436
00:33:21,278 --> 00:33:24,270
You're on Team Rocket.
Why aren't you locked up like we are?

437
00:33:24,347 --> 00:33:28,545
I'm valuable 'cause I can talk human talk.
That'll come in handy.

438
00:33:28,652 --> 00:33:29,914
But then why are we?

439
00:33:29,986 --> 00:33:33,922
They'll let you go as long as I do my job,
and don't try any funny stuff.

440
00:33:36,826 --> 00:33:39,226
You scratch its back
and it scratches yours.

441
00:33:42,632 --> 00:33:44,293
Well, we're moving out.

442
00:33:49,239 --> 00:33:53,539
- Hey, that's the twerps' Pikachu.
- Meowth, you're working with the enemy.

443
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,602
Take it easy, you two. Don't you see
this is the perfect opportunity?

444
00:33:57,681 --> 00:34:00,878
As soon as we get this mess cleaned up,
I'll grab Pikachu.

445
00:34:01,451 --> 00:34:04,249
- What do you think, Jessie?
- I think we can trust Meowth.

446
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:06,585
Then I'll take Pikachu straight to the boss.

447
00:34:06,656 --> 00:34:10,683
He'll be so happy,
I bet I'll finally get a Team Rocket uniform.

448
00:34:10,927 --> 00:34:11,916
Traitor!

449
00:34:24,975 --> 00:34:26,499
<i>Should I let them go?</i>

450
00:34:27,644 --> 00:34:30,613
<i>All creatures ought to control</i>
<i>their own destinies.</i>

451
00:34:31,715 --> 00:34:33,683
<i>Or should I force them to stay?</i>

452
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:38,248
<i>Here I can use my powers</i>
<i>to protect them from harm.</i>

453
00:34:39,356 --> 00:34:43,315
<i>But do I have the right to keep them</i>
<i>from living as they choose?</i>

454
00:34:43,927 --> 00:34:45,394
<i>Which is more important:</i>

455
00:34:46,029 --> 00:34:49,089
<i>Their safety or their freedom?</i>

456
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:11,716
<i>I'm coming, Pikachu.</i>

457
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:25,800
What is this place?

458
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:35,601
It's off the chart!

459
00:35:37,047 --> 00:35:40,278
Luna, this spring must be the source
for Purity River.

460
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:42,477
The water's chemical makeup
is astounding.

461
00:35:42,919 --> 00:35:44,352
I knew it would be.

462
00:35:45,455 --> 00:35:50,017
The human body, in fact all living things,
are made up of mostly water.

463
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:52,194
Water is essential for life.

464
00:35:52,262 --> 00:35:55,698
The quality of water helps determine
the quality of life.

465
00:35:55,765 --> 00:36:00,361
Yes. This place is bursting with life.
That's because it's clean here.

466
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:04,968
Untouched. Pure.
And the source of that purity is the spring.

467
00:36:05,241 --> 00:36:09,268
Maybe this spring isn't just the source
of all the water in Purity Canyon.

468
00:36:09,345 --> 00:36:13,577
It could be the source of a new way
to bring health and happiness to the world.

469
00:36:14,617 --> 00:36:17,814
We may be standing on the edge
of the most important discovery...

470
00:36:17,887 --> 00:36:19,252
...in medical history.

471
00:36:22,692 --> 00:36:23,681
Cuties.

472
00:36:24,027 --> 00:36:27,588
Without a Pokémon breeder around,
it's amazing they all look so healthy.

473
00:36:27,997 --> 00:36:32,263
In a habitat as clean as this, they couldn't
help but be strong and healthy.

474
00:36:32,802 --> 00:36:35,737
The air, the food and the water
are all natural.

475
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,303
I wonder if their parents are nearby.

476
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:43,240
They're watching over them from up there.
They're all very protective and very proud.

477
00:36:44,781 --> 00:36:47,875
The babies here are living happy,
healthy lives.

478
00:36:48,218 --> 00:36:51,278
They look just as happy and healthy
as their offspring.

479
00:36:51,855 --> 00:36:54,790
I think we should move on now.
They might get nervous.

480
00:36:54,858 --> 00:36:56,621
We have to find Pikachu.

481
00:36:57,026 --> 00:36:59,824
I just hope Pikachu's someplace
where it's nice and safe.

482
00:37:02,132 --> 00:37:03,224
I made it.

483
00:37:57,053 --> 00:37:59,647
Come on. Hurry. Pull yourself together.

484
00:38:02,325 --> 00:38:06,625
Sorry, pal. I didn't mean to scratch you up.
I just don't want them to catch you.

485
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:09,922
Come on. We gotta get out of here.
Run for it!

486
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:07,353
<i>You.</i>

487
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:10,057
It's been quite a while. You look well.

488
00:39:10,526 --> 00:39:12,824
<i>Leave this place at once.</i>

489
00:39:13,663 --> 00:39:17,963
<i>I warn you, my strength is far greater</i>
<i>than when we first met.</i>

490
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:20,895
Your increased strength
comes as no surprise.

491
00:39:21,137 --> 00:39:23,332
Fortunately, my technicians predicted it...

492
00:39:23,406 --> 00:39:26,466
...and they've created new technology
to deal with it.

493
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:43,055
It seems my new equipment
is worth the considerable investment.

494
00:39:44,894 --> 00:39:49,058
<i>You should fear my powers most of all.</i>
<i>You cannot conquer me.</i>

495
00:39:49,399 --> 00:39:52,061
Your psychic attacks
bend the wills of living creatures...

496
00:39:52,135 --> 00:39:54,103
...but they cannot influence machines.

497
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:58,339
<i>We will see about that.</i>

498
00:39:59,208 --> 00:40:00,937
Activate the force fields.

499
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:12,186
Well done, Mewtwo.

500
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:15,656
You have demonstrated
that technology has its limits.

501
00:40:15,825 --> 00:40:17,816
An important lesson to keep in mind.

502
00:40:18,962 --> 00:40:21,487
But living creatures have their limits, too.

503
00:40:21,898 --> 00:40:24,833
<i>Do not test the limits of my power.</i>

504
00:40:25,935 --> 00:40:27,960
It appears that would be futile.

505
00:40:28,237 --> 00:40:31,798
So, we'll take our battle to that island.

506
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:36,803
I'll fly over there...

507
00:40:38,147 --> 00:40:39,512
...for Phase 2.

508
00:40:42,018 --> 00:40:45,852
I understand that some Pokémon friends
of yours are over on that island.

509
00:40:46,556 --> 00:40:51,186
- We'll see how powerful your loyalties are.
- <i>You are despicable.</i>

510
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:59,092
What's going on?

511
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:04,361
Unfortunately, your being here
is very inconvenient for us.

512
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:08,342
We can't let anyone interfere and
prevent us from reaching our objectives.

513
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:11,141
We can't let you leave
until our operation is over.

514
00:41:11,214 --> 00:41:12,340
You better!

515
00:41:12,882 --> 00:41:14,349
- James.
- What?

516
00:41:14,951 --> 00:41:18,045
If Meowth doesn't come back,
what do we do <i>about...</i>

517
00:41:18,788 --> 00:41:21,780
If Meowth doesn't come back,
what do we do about what?

518
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:26,295
- What do we do about the motto?
- I never thought about that.

519
00:41:26,729 --> 00:41:28,890
Maybe we should start practicing.

520
00:41:30,633 --> 00:41:32,260
One, <i>two...</i>

521
00:41:33,169 --> 00:41:36,935
<i>Looks like Team Rocket's</i>
<i>never blasting off again.</i>

522
00:41:50,219 --> 00:41:52,210
Aren't they simply adorable?

523
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:55,215
Those Pokémon are just babies.
Leave them alone!

524
00:42:09,338 --> 00:42:10,464
Stop it, Domino!

525
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:13,338
I know trainers catch their Pokémon
with Poké Balls...

526
00:42:13,409 --> 00:42:15,206
...but I prefer our method.

527
00:42:16,913 --> 00:42:19,006
Make certain not a single one gets away.

528
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:24,315
These Pokémon are just going to be used
in experiments and as bait for Mewtwo.

529
00:42:24,587 --> 00:42:26,521
No sense in wasting Poké Balls.

530
00:42:28,424 --> 00:42:31,791
Well, what do we have here?
Some rare and valuable Pokémon?

531
00:42:31,994 --> 00:42:36,488
- You know very well we're not Pokémon!
- Oh, that's right. I was mistaken.

532
00:42:36,799 --> 00:42:39,597
Team Rocket agents are as useless
as you are rare.

533
00:42:39,669 --> 00:42:42,365
But they certainly are not very valuable.

534
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:46,699
<i>009 to Giovanni.</i>

535
00:42:46,776 --> 00:42:49,244
<i>Except the Pokémon brought</i>
<i>by a young trainer...</i>

536
00:42:49,312 --> 00:42:51,780
<i>... the island's populated</i>
<i>by Pokémon clones.</i>

537
00:42:51,848 --> 00:42:54,009
<i>And we've got them, over.</i>

538
00:42:54,584 --> 00:42:57,485
Excellent. The trap is set
and now we have our bait.

539
00:42:57,553 --> 00:43:01,114
<i>Mewtwo, are you going to let</i>
<i>your little friends battle me alone?</i>

540
00:43:01,691 --> 00:43:04,182
<i>I cannot. I must help them.</i>

541
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,493
These guys all want to help out, too.

542
00:43:13,069 --> 00:43:16,766
Who, me? I should come along with you?
What do you think?

543
00:43:17,707 --> 00:43:22,337
Okay. I have to admit I ain't got
a lot of experience at being unselfish.

544
00:43:22,445 --> 00:43:24,970
But if you can do it,
I guess I can give it a try.

545
00:43:29,819 --> 00:43:33,550
<i>We must live where and how we choose!</i>

546
00:43:36,692 --> 00:43:38,819
<i>Friends, to the island.</i>

547
00:43:48,704 --> 00:43:49,762
<i>009?</i>

548
00:43:50,106 --> 00:43:53,303
- <i>This is 009.</i>
- <i>Mewtwo is headed your way.</i>

549
00:43:53,476 --> 00:43:54,738
Roger, we're...

550
00:43:58,714 --> 00:44:02,411
I've been expecting you.
This little Nidoqueen sure is a cutie.

551
00:44:02,485 --> 00:44:04,248
<i>Release that young one.</i>

552
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:09,384
Maybe that's something
you should take up with my boss.

553
00:44:09,458 --> 00:44:10,755
Here he is now.

554
00:44:13,196 --> 00:44:14,561
Nice to see you.

555
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:18,196
Do I take it that you're willing
to obey my commands?

556
00:44:18,267 --> 00:44:22,601
<i>No. I would sooner leave this world</i>
<i>than serve you.</i>

557
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:25,636
I suggest you reconsider your opinion.

558
00:44:25,841 --> 00:44:27,331
If you choose to defy me...

559
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,436
...your fellow creations will all be used
in our experiments...

560
00:44:30,513 --> 00:44:32,538
...and will certainly leave this world.

561
00:44:36,752 --> 00:44:39,312
<i>Stand away. I must submit to him.</i>

562
00:44:41,457 --> 00:44:44,358
This is not meant to destroy you.
It has been developed...

563
00:44:44,427 --> 00:44:48,124
...to simply harness your abilities
and mold your will to my purposes.

564
00:44:49,966 --> 00:44:51,831
<i>Your purposes?</i>

565
00:44:52,034 --> 00:44:56,130
Don't waste your time destroying them.
We're quite capable of building new ones.

566
00:44:56,205 --> 00:45:00,574
But, if you try to fight us,
your little friends will pay the price.

567
00:45:11,687 --> 00:45:13,211
<i>I will do as you say.</i>

568
00:45:14,657 --> 00:45:17,023
All you have to do now
is step into the light.

569
00:45:30,673 --> 00:45:33,471
They're telling it to stop
but it's going anyway.

570
00:45:33,609 --> 00:45:35,304
This could be a big mistake.

571
00:45:40,416 --> 00:45:44,318
That's a good boy. Now you won't be able
to run away from me again.

572
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:49,580
<i>You may control my body.</i>
<i>But you will never control my will.</i>

573
00:45:50,793 --> 00:45:52,090
We'll soon see.

574
00:45:54,697 --> 00:45:57,165
<i>I will not submit!</i>

575
00:45:59,268 --> 00:46:03,261
You are strong, but pain makes the body
master of the will.

576
00:46:03,406 --> 00:46:05,203
Let's see how long they struggle.

577
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:12,037
This is a very charming place.

578
00:46:12,348 --> 00:46:15,784
I had a feeling you'd find
a pretty little hideaway like this.

579
00:46:15,885 --> 00:46:18,353
It's perfect for my new laboratory.

580
00:46:18,988 --> 00:46:23,288
Finally, I will create a vast army
of the world's most powerful Pokémon.

581
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:24,391
And you.

582
00:46:25,494 --> 00:46:28,486
You will be at its head,
carrying out my commands!

583
00:46:28,964 --> 00:46:31,091
Together, we will rule the earth!

584
00:46:44,847 --> 00:46:46,007
Pikachu!

585
00:46:48,484 --> 00:46:51,920
Pikachu. You both look wiped out.
What did they do to you?

586
00:46:53,589 --> 00:46:56,456
Luna, get the spring water
that's in the vial in my pocket.

587
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,584
- It may revive them.
- Right.

588
00:47:02,064 --> 00:47:04,191
This might be just what they need.

589
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:15,501
It worked!

590
00:47:17,747 --> 00:47:19,442
That water is just incredible.

591
00:47:19,515 --> 00:47:22,882
I knew it was healthy, but its healing
powers are absolutely amazing.

592
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:25,049
Stop muttering and start walking.

593
00:47:25,121 --> 00:47:27,589
You can't stay here.
We have a place all prepared.

594
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:29,416
And where's that?

595
00:47:30,726 --> 00:47:33,126
You better let us out of here right now!

596
00:47:33,963 --> 00:47:35,692
You may not get out at all.

597
00:47:43,439 --> 00:47:47,671
<i>Everything is going according to plan.</i>
<i>Construction of our base is proceeding.</i>

598
00:47:47,743 --> 00:47:49,267
<i>What's the status of Mewtwo?</i>

599
00:47:49,512 --> 00:47:53,141
It's stronger than I realized.
Its brainwaves haven't altered in the least!

600
00:47:53,282 --> 00:47:56,774
If this goes on much longer,
its body will be destroyed before its will!

601
00:47:56,852 --> 00:47:59,650
You can't destroy it.
It could take years to clone it again.

602
00:47:59,722 --> 00:48:04,557
I know that! But this has become a battle
between Mewtwo's will and mine!

603
00:48:07,797 --> 00:48:09,992
Well, don't take it out on me!

604
00:48:10,299 --> 00:48:13,268
Can't you two work faster?
Use some elbow grease.

605
00:48:13,335 --> 00:48:16,862
I want to be able to see my face
in that floor. Now, hurry up!

606
00:48:18,174 --> 00:48:19,607
We'll show her!

607
00:48:41,997 --> 00:48:43,555
What are they saying?

608
00:48:45,401 --> 00:48:48,268
They say they're coming
and they're very angry.

609
00:48:48,337 --> 00:48:50,396
What are you talking about?
Who's coming?

610
00:48:51,006 --> 00:48:52,598
The Bug Pokémon.

611
00:48:52,808 --> 00:48:55,538
They're mad at the people
that are polluting the lake.

612
00:48:55,611 --> 00:48:57,374
And they're coming to stop them!

613
00:48:58,581 --> 00:48:59,639
Be quiet.

614
00:49:03,486 --> 00:49:04,919
What's happening?

615
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,455
Hey, what's that?

616
00:49:19,134 --> 00:49:20,624
What's going on?

617
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:25,934
Hey! Look!

618
00:49:26,342 --> 00:49:29,641
- A way out.
- Now's our chance. Come on, everybody.

619
00:49:30,379 --> 00:49:31,471
Hurry!

620
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:35,442
Luna, I'm going back that way.

621
00:49:35,518 --> 00:49:37,918
- What for?
- I'm worried about the spring.

622
00:49:37,987 --> 00:49:39,579
I'll go along with you.

623
00:49:55,871 --> 00:49:59,034
They'll never stop the Black Tulip
because I can think on my feet.

624
00:50:04,914 --> 00:50:07,747
I guess that floor we mopped
is still a little slippery.

625
00:50:07,816 --> 00:50:09,841
Perfect for a character like her.

626
00:50:13,122 --> 00:50:16,114
What happened, Domino?
You looked fine when you first came in.

627
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,455
- But now your face seems...
- A little pale.

628
00:50:22,464 --> 00:50:24,625
The water hasn't been contaminated.

629
00:50:25,434 --> 00:50:26,366
Thank goodness.

630
00:50:32,975 --> 00:50:35,239
<i>I am glad you are safe.</i>

631
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,475
<i>But I cannot bear this much longer.</i>

632
00:50:38,948 --> 00:50:39,937
Mewtwo.

633
00:50:40,382 --> 00:50:43,545
- <i>How do you know my name?</i>
- We heard it from Meowth.

634
00:50:43,619 --> 00:50:46,611
And Meowth told us you're the one
who saved my Pikachu.

635
00:50:46,689 --> 00:50:49,021
There's got to be some way
we can help you now.

636
00:50:49,425 --> 00:50:51,256
<i>Stop these machines.</i>

637
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:54,089
Brock, maybe there's a cutoff switch.

638
00:50:54,363 --> 00:50:56,490
It's no use. They're all sealed up.

639
00:50:56,832 --> 00:50:58,800
Well, we'll have to tackle them!

640
00:51:00,302 --> 00:51:01,860
Hit it harder.

641
00:51:16,318 --> 00:51:17,910
We can't stop it!

642
00:51:17,987 --> 00:51:20,979
<i>Then I must use what remains</i>
<i>of my power.</i>

643
00:51:21,757 --> 00:51:26,387
<i>Either these machines will be destroyed,</i>
<i>or I will be!</i>

644
00:51:33,569 --> 00:51:36,129
- Hang in there, Mewtwo!
- You can do it!

645
00:51:38,207 --> 00:51:40,732
Both of you,
help out with your thunderbolt.

646
00:51:55,524 --> 00:51:57,856
You did it. You beat them.

647
00:51:58,527 --> 00:51:59,755
<i>Yes...</i>

648
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:03,795
<i>... but I have also destroyed myself.</i>

649
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:10,771
The spring. They're saying,
''Come to the spring, Mewtwo! <i>''</i>

650
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:14,331
The water there did revive the Pikachu.
Maybe it'll help Mewtwo.

651
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:15,672
Then let's go there.

652
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,008
You're not going anywhere.

653
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:22,710
Mewtwo belongs to me
and I alone will be the one to decide...

654
00:52:22,785 --> 00:52:24,719
...whether it will survive or not.

655
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:26,015
No, you won't!

656
00:52:26,088 --> 00:52:27,453
We won't let you!

657
00:52:28,157 --> 00:52:29,055
Go!

658
00:52:36,598 --> 00:52:38,259
It's the boss. What do we do?

659
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:42,064
If he sees us, he may do something drastic,
like ask for our expense report.

660
00:52:42,137 --> 00:52:44,401
- Hey, guys, it's great to see you.
- You?

661
00:52:45,074 --> 00:52:47,702
- Come on, let's find a place to hide.
- Right.

662
00:52:49,011 --> 00:52:50,808
- You take Mewtwo.
- Okay.

663
00:52:52,247 --> 00:52:53,009
No!

664
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:57,012
What?

665
00:52:57,753 --> 00:53:00,551
So, you wish to defy me
as your leader has?

666
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:03,490
Very well then. I'll crush you, too.

667
00:53:05,761 --> 00:53:07,729
Thanks, guys. Keep going.

668
00:53:12,334 --> 00:53:13,494
<i>Why?</i>

669
00:53:14,369 --> 00:53:16,337
<i>Why are you helping me?</i>

670
00:53:16,538 --> 00:53:20,201
For one thing, you saved my Pikachu.
That's a good reason.

671
00:53:20,542 --> 00:53:21,873
<i>The only one?</i>

672
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:24,307
Do you always need a reason
to help somebody?

673
00:53:24,847 --> 00:53:26,747
<i>Perhaps you are unique.</i>

674
00:53:27,049 --> 00:53:30,314
<i>A unique human. One of a kind.</i>

675
00:53:30,986 --> 00:53:34,353
You're one of a kind, too. Everybody is.

676
00:53:35,491 --> 00:53:37,823
<i>I do not know what I am.</i>

677
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:40,561
<i>And soon it may not matter.</i>

678
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:42,894
Ash!

679
00:53:43,265 --> 00:53:44,664
What Pokémon is that?

680
00:53:45,033 --> 00:53:48,525
This is Mewtwo. It's real weak
and it needs to get into that spring...

681
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:50,902
...or it's not going to make it!
- Ash, wait.

682
00:53:50,973 --> 00:53:54,465
Don't get that Pokémon near the water,
it might contaminate the spring.

683
00:53:54,543 --> 00:53:56,443
This water has minerals humans need.

684
00:53:56,512 --> 00:54:00,141
I'm sorry, but right now the one
who needs that water most is Mewtwo.

685
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:07,019
<i>I have seen this place.</i>

686
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:10,615
<i>I have been here before.</i>

687
00:54:11,193 --> 00:54:13,889
<i>Was it in my dreams?</i>

688
00:54:15,297 --> 00:54:17,162
<i>But this is no dream.</i>

689
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:21,094
<i>I feel new life rising within me.</i>

690
00:54:23,005 --> 00:54:24,063
<i>Mew?</i>

691
00:54:26,742 --> 00:54:30,872
<i>If these waters have</i>
<i>the same restoring effect on me...</i>

692
00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:33,813
<i>... as they do on other Pokémon...</i>

693
00:54:34,449 --> 00:54:37,782
<i>... Pokémon who belong to this world...</i>

694
00:54:38,020 --> 00:54:39,510
<i>... could it be...</i>

695
00:54:39,588 --> 00:54:43,888
<i>... that this world is my rightful place, too?</i>

696
00:54:47,229 --> 00:54:48,218
They're here!

697
00:54:48,530 --> 00:54:50,259
<i>Tell me where Mewtwo is.</i>

698
00:54:52,601 --> 00:54:55,263
Stop it. You can't come here
and destroy the spring!

699
00:54:55,337 --> 00:54:58,170
Yes, I can. This place belongs to me.

700
00:55:03,212 --> 00:55:07,649
<i>You will not defile this place.</i>
<i>It does not belong to you...</i>

701
00:55:08,383 --> 00:55:10,715
<i>... any more than I do!</i>

702
00:55:19,328 --> 00:55:20,693
What's happening?

703
00:55:20,963 --> 00:55:23,261
<i>This place has given me new life.</i>

704
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:33,004
<i>Now I shall use all my power to defend it.</i>

705
00:55:57,666 --> 00:56:01,158
What's happened here? What's going on?
Why is everyone standing around?

706
00:56:01,236 --> 00:56:02,533
Where is Mewtwo?

707
00:56:02,604 --> 00:56:04,128
The spring is gone.

708
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:07,441
What about the sample?

709
00:56:07,509 --> 00:56:11,536
We may be in luck. We may be able
to create a synthetic version in the lab.

710
00:56:11,613 --> 00:56:14,776
Yes, but I wonder what happened
to all the Pokémon.

711
00:56:17,386 --> 00:56:18,978
This is amazing!

712
00:56:19,054 --> 00:56:22,251
<i>I have moved the lake and the spring</i>
<i>beneath Mt. Quena.</i>

713
00:56:22,491 --> 00:56:24,288
<i>They will be protected here.</i>

714
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:27,657
Wait until I call Professor Oak
and tell him about this!

715
00:56:27,729 --> 00:56:30,562
<i>You will tell no one.</i>
<i>Once you leave this place...</i>

716
00:56:30,632 --> 00:56:35,228
<i>... you must leave behind your memories</i>
<i>of me and all you have seen here.</i>

717
00:56:35,537 --> 00:56:37,528
You're going to make us forget?

718
00:56:37,739 --> 00:56:39,172
You can't do that!

719
00:56:40,575 --> 00:56:43,510
- Meowth, be quiet!
- Don't stick your nose into this, Meowth!

720
00:56:43,578 --> 00:56:47,480
It's got nothing to do with my nose.
It's what all the other Pokémon are saying.

721
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,747
It's only natural to wonder about who
and where you came from.

722
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:54,687
And some day,
these little ones will want some answers.

723
00:56:54,756 --> 00:56:56,519
Only, there won't be any.

724
00:56:56,591 --> 00:56:58,957
Not if you're going to make
everybody forget!

725
00:57:00,929 --> 00:57:04,626
So what if their parents were clones?
They're all living creatures.

726
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,099
They deserve to live.

727
00:57:06,168 --> 00:57:10,969
They deserve to know about themselves
just as much as you, me, or anybody does.

728
00:57:11,373 --> 00:57:13,466
That's what we think.

729
00:57:14,576 --> 00:57:17,477
I think we should remember, too.
Meowth is right.

730
00:57:17,646 --> 00:57:20,672
Forgetting things doesn't change the fact
that they happened.

731
00:57:20,749 --> 00:57:25,083
Don't you think everyone deserves to know
who they are and where they came from?

732
00:57:26,321 --> 00:57:29,313
<i>Yes. They deserve to remember.</i>

733
00:57:30,592 --> 00:57:34,153
<i>If we are able to look to the future</i>
<i>as other Pokémon do...</i>

734
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,398
<i>... we must also be able to look to the past.</i>

735
00:57:38,066 --> 00:57:40,762
<i>The shame of that past is not ours.</i>

736
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:44,971
<i>It belongs to those</i>
<i>who used our past to set us apart.</i>

737
00:57:45,207 --> 00:57:48,404
<i>To ensure the safety</i>
<i>of all my fellow Pokémon...</i>

738
00:57:48,477 --> 00:57:50,468
<i>... and of this healing place...</i>

739
00:57:50,746 --> 00:57:55,410
<i>... I will clear only the memories</i>
<i>of those who seek to destroy them.</i>

740
00:58:08,964 --> 00:58:11,489
<i>Only they shall forget.</i>

741
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:31,180
009, why are we here?
What's the Combat Unit doing?

742
00:58:31,486 --> 00:58:33,954
Maybe we're on some kind
of a secret mission.

743
00:58:34,156 --> 00:58:35,885
What kind of secret mission?

744
00:58:36,024 --> 00:58:39,221
I don't know any more than you,
but if we don't get out of here...

745
00:58:39,294 --> 00:58:42,559
...it won't be secret!
- We should withdraw our forces at once.

746
00:58:42,864 --> 00:58:46,595
It's strange, but I have the feeling
I have been utterly defeated.

747
00:58:54,376 --> 00:58:56,867
<i>The time has come for us to depart.</i>

748
00:59:07,255 --> 00:59:10,224
If you ever see our balloon,
fly by and say hello.

749
00:59:12,294 --> 00:59:15,263
<i>Thank you. I will remember you always.</i>

750
00:59:15,831 --> 00:59:18,459
This time, we'll both be able to remember.

751
00:59:31,379 --> 00:59:36,214
<i>Lf, someday, you hear my voice,</i>
<i>know that it is my spirit...</i>

752
00:59:36,685 --> 00:59:40,951
<i>... calling across time and space to yours.</i>

753
00:59:55,504 --> 00:59:58,564
Luna called and said you might need a ride
back to the <i>city...</i>

754
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,666
- Hey, don't you even have a knapsack?
- I'm not going back.

755
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:05,509
Luna and I discovered we have
a lot in common besides research.

756
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:18,792
<i>I will remember you...</i>

757
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:21,493
