<i>Deep in the heart of Africa
is a place no man has ever entered.</i>

4
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:40,156
<i>A place that belongs to the lion,
the elephant and the ape.</i>

5
00:00:40,281 --> 00:00:42,784
<i>A place known as the Bukuvu.</i>

6
00:00:42,992 --> 00:00:46,704
<i>Travellers flying overhead
can only glimpse at its many marvels:</i>

7
00:00:47,205 --> 00:00:49,040
<i>its sparkling rivers...</i>

8
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:53,419
<i>its lush veldts,
its billowy cloud formations...</i>

9
00:00:53,628 --> 00:00:57,549
<i>and its hidden mountains.</i>

10
00:00:59,092 --> 00:01:00,802
<i>- Never fear, my friends.</i>
- George!

11
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:03,137
<i>- All was not lost.</i>
- George!

12
00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:07,058
<i>Scraped and boo-booed,
they searched high and low...</i>

13
00:01:07,225 --> 00:01:11,062
<i>but they never recovered
their most precious cargo.</i>

<i>has grown into
a swinging jungle king.</i>

Hi, everybody. Me again.

47
00:02:56,125 --> 00:02:59,379
Third day in Mbwebwe.
Look at this incredible...

48
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:03,508
- Banyan tree.
- Banyan tree. And look what's in it.

49
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:11,432
Could you die?

50
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:13,643
And over here...

51
00:03:13,643 --> 00:03:17,021
is the outhouse, which you
don't want to see, believe me.

52
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:20,024
By the way, Betsy, thank you so
much for those moist towelettes.

53
00:03:20,149 --> 00:03:22,443
They've been a lifesaver.

54
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,114
And these are the wonderful porters.
Wave, guys.

55
00:03:26,447 --> 00:03:28,616
And this is our guide, Mr Kwame.

56
00:03:28,783 --> 00:03:31,870
Without him, we would be lost.
Hi.

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,708
This is great.

58
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:41,004
- And this is... Lyle!
- Hello, Bujumburans.

59
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:43,047
What are you doing here?

60
00:03:43,047 --> 00:03:45,758
What kind of greeting is that
to give your fiancÃ©?

61
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,469
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Yeah, of course I am.

62
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:53,182
The jungle loves you.
You're beautiful.

63
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:54,350
How did you find me?

64
00:03:54,392 --> 00:03:57,812
Well, I just hired the two
best trackers in the business.

65
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:02,525
Ah, I'm chafing, Max.
Ah, yeah, I'm chafing big time.

66
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:06,529
Didn't I tell you not to wear 20 pounds
of black leather in the jungle?

67
00:04:06,696 --> 00:04:08,698
- Didn't I tell ya?
- Ah.

68
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,576
Cotton, I said. Cotton breathes.

69
00:04:11,743 --> 00:04:14,454
Take my things to the lady's tent
and shake a leg.

70
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,920
<i>Later that night, Lyle van de Groot
lost no time in making arrangements...</i>

71
00:04:22,086 --> 00:04:25,590
<i>- to whisk his wayward fiancÃ©e back home.</i>
- All right, I'll take it, I'll take it.

72
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:29,219
Nairobi Hilton.
They can airlift us there in two hours.

73
00:04:29,385 --> 00:04:31,262
Pillows, okay?

74
00:04:31,387 --> 00:04:35,016
Wait a second. I'm losing you.
Bad reception here.

75
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:37,477
Okay, I've got you back.
No, wait! I'm losing you!

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,979
My batteries are dead!
No! Doody!

77
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:42,023
I don't want to go anyway, Lyle.

78
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:46,277
Tomorrow we're gonna climb the mountain where
the big apes are. Don't you wanna see them?

79
00:04:46,444 --> 00:04:51,991
Only if they can shake a good gin
Martini without bruising it. Hiyo!

80
00:04:52,617 --> 00:04:53,910
Me and Thor here would be happy

81
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:56,204
to help you and the lady up the
mountain, Mr. van de Groot.

82
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:59,624
- Yeah.
- With Mr. Kwame leading the way, of course.

83
00:04:59,832 --> 00:05:02,210
If you don't mind me saying so,
the apes...

84
00:05:02,377 --> 00:05:06,965
are supposed to be a fascinating sight,
especially that white ape.

85
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,801
White ape? What's that?

86
00:05:09,926 --> 00:05:14,055
Ask Mr. Kwame.
I bet he can tell you.

87
00:05:14,222 --> 00:05:19,143
- It is only a native legend.
- Could you please tell us?

88
00:05:20,687 --> 00:05:23,189
The people say he is
over seven feet tall...

89
00:05:23,314 --> 00:05:25,650
with the strength of a lion.

90
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:28,278
When the moon is full
and the air is sweet...

91
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,572
he wanders alone
through the jungle...

92
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:35,326
piercing the silence of the valley
with his mournful call.

93
00:05:35,493 --> 00:05:38,413
Now, some say he is
thirsty for blood.

94
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:43,543
Others say he is calling
for the mate that he longs for...

95
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:46,045
but will never find.

96
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:50,633
By day, he rules the entire Bukuvu
from the top of the mountain.

97
00:05:51,134 --> 00:05:52,552
But by night...

98
00:05:52,594 --> 00:05:56,347
He and Bigfoot run the candy counter
at the Bukuvu Cineplex.

99
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:58,182
Now playing on all 14 screens:

100
00:05:58,349 --> 00:06:00,476
Planet of the Apes.

101
00:06:04,188 --> 00:06:08,818
Bigfoot? Max, that'd be worth
a lot more than any white...

102
00:06:08,985 --> 00:06:12,530
- Ursula, what are we doing here?
- Lyle, I came all this way...

103
00:06:12,697 --> 00:06:15,825
Okay, okay.
The things I do for you.

104
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,953
Looks like we're on, fellows.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,414
<i>As the sun rose
over Ape Mountain...</i>

106
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,710
<i>its agitated inhabitants sent an urgent
message to George by bongo-gram...</i>

107
00:06:25,877 --> 00:06:28,838
<i>warning the jungle king that
intruders were close afoot.</i>

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,007
Ooh. Lyle, listen.
What was that?

109
00:06:31,049 --> 00:06:34,219
Could be the mating call
of the white ape.

110
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,596
Huh. White ape.
Sounds like a drink.

111
00:06:36,638 --> 00:06:39,724
Uh, yes, bartender. I'll have
two Black Russians and a White Ape.

112
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:43,019
<i>A drink the venal van de Groot
would be begging to imbibe...</i>

113
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:47,023
<i>if he only knew how near the white ape
was at that very moment...</i>

114
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:50,276
<i>flying through the foliage,
surveying the scenery, cruising in...</i>

115
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:55,698
<i>for a closer look and swinging on
through the trees with effortless ease.</i>

116
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:56,824
Ow!

117
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,871
<i>And so, onward and upward
the tired trekkers trudged...</i>

118
00:07:02,038 --> 00:07:04,832
<i>on feverish footsies
over perilous paths.</i>

119
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:09,170
<i>When they finally beheld the mighty
Ape Mountain, they reacted with awe.</i>

120
00:07:09,337 --> 00:07:14,801
- Aww.
<i>- I said "awe". A-W-E.</i>

121
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:17,470
- Ooh!
- That's better.

122
00:07:17,595 --> 00:07:21,641
Single file on the bridge.
Step very cautiously.

123
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,937
It is full of rotten planks.
One false move, you could fall over.

124
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:29,941
Then you will have
a very long time to wave goodbye.

125
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,777
Don't you worry, peanut.
I was on a bridge like this in Maui.

126
00:07:32,944 --> 00:07:35,071
It was steady as a rock. See?

127
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:37,657
Hey! S-Stop! Stop that!
Stop that! What th...

128
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,242
Yee-haw!

129
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,372
- I got you.
- No!

130
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,671
<i>Don't worry.
Nobody dies in this story.</i>

131
00:07:52,255 --> 00:07:55,174
<i>They just get
really big boo-boos.</i>

132
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,176
<i>What did I tell you?</i>

133
00:07:57,343 --> 00:08:00,638
You know, they shouldn't let inexperienced
guides like that on these treks.

134
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,899
Did you see the look
that guy just gave me?

135
00:08:11,065 --> 00:08:14,319
Probably saying I'm the biggest jerk
they've ever seen in their lives.

136
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,696
Probably trying to think
of something evil to do to me.

137
00:08:25,288 --> 00:08:27,290
If they turn on us,
we're never gonna get home.

138
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:31,628
It's up to me to make the peace.
I'm going in.

139
00:08:31,711 --> 00:08:34,756
Gentlemen. Cigar, cigarette?

140
00:08:34,923 --> 00:08:38,051
Okay, gifts from America.

141
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:41,304
I give you a cigar,
you give me some of your lands.

142
00:08:41,346 --> 00:08:45,141
All right.
A first contact has been made.

143
00:08:45,475 --> 00:08:48,228
Ready, aim...

144
00:08:51,105 --> 00:08:54,234
There you go, my man. Huh?

145
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,527
You like magic fire? Do ya?

146
00:08:57,111 --> 00:08:59,781
Well, get a load of this.

147
00:09:01,699 --> 00:09:04,661
There you go. Magic picture.

148
00:09:04,827 --> 00:09:07,705
Yet another gift from America.
Here you go.

149
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:09,791
You're welcome.

150
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,507
Thirty-five millimetre...

151
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,768
Translation, please.

152
00:09:28,851 --> 00:09:30,645
He says that he likes
your magic pictures...

153
00:09:30,728 --> 00:09:34,983
but he prefers the resolution of
the Leica 35 millimetre transparencies.

154
00:09:35,066 --> 00:09:39,404
He also says your lens is dirty, but he
has the equipment to clean it for you.

155
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Well, tell him to clean this
while he's at it.

156
00:09:46,327 --> 00:09:48,121
- Come on, let's go.
- Where?

157
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:51,207
Find you an ape, so we
can get the heck outta here.

158
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:55,753
Lyle, we can't go into the jungle alone.
We could get lost out here.

159
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:56,838
It's my job to get you
what you want.

160
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,382
You want a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles...

161
00:09:59,591 --> 00:10:02,594
you will get a double decaf
latte with mocha sprinkles.

162
00:10:02,677 --> 00:10:05,555
You want a white ape,
I'll get you a white ape.

163
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:08,141
Here, monkey, monkey, monkey.

164
00:10:08,349 --> 00:10:11,227
Here, gorilla, gorilla. Come on.

165
00:10:15,773 --> 00:10:19,193
- Don't move.
- You mean I actually found one? It worked?

166
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:36,920
- God, that scared me.
- Scared me, too.

167
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,638
I'm gonna go get help.
You wait here.

168
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,115
Oh, no.

169
00:11:46,698 --> 00:11:50,034
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty.

170
00:12:08,136 --> 00:12:10,305
When lion brush last?

171
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,935
Don't tickle. Don't ti... No...

172
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:33,077
Rubber tree always good for clothesline.
Upsy, kitty.

173
00:12:44,047 --> 00:12:46,716
George not even trying hard.

174
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:57,185
Flying pile driver.
Havin' some fun now.

175
00:12:57,393 --> 00:12:59,938
Bad kitty!

176
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:22,627
- That close one, huh?
- Watch out for that tree!

177
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,962
Huh?

178
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:29,926
Oops.

179
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:36,140
Funny-looking fella.

180
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,693
White ape.

181
00:13:49,904 --> 00:13:51,948
U-Ursula! Ursu... Wha...

182
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,540
Ursula, I found your scrunchie.

183
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,864
Go away!

184
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:38,036
It was horrible.

185
00:14:38,203 --> 00:14:41,664
It was... 400-pound
white ape man.

186
00:14:42,123 --> 00:14:46,461
The white ape has my girlfriend.

187
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:51,132
I held him off as long as I could.
Blood everywhere.

188
00:14:51,299 --> 00:14:54,010
The white ape... my girlfriend.

189
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:57,180
He... He weighs 400 pounds.

190
00:14:57,305 --> 00:15:00,767
The white ape got my girlfriend!
The white ape got...

191
00:15:00,934 --> 00:15:03,937
Help! Help! Man needs help!

192
00:15:17,283 --> 00:15:19,994
<i>After a night
of feverish fantasies...</i>

193
00:15:20,161 --> 00:15:23,331
<i>the perfectly permed heiress,
Ursula Stanhope...</i>

194
00:15:23,498 --> 00:15:28,294
<i>awoke to the melodious music of the
Bukuvu bird life, and found herself...</i>

195
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,923
<i>venturing forth in search
of that defender of the innocent...</i>

196
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,677
<i>protector of the weak,
and all-around good guy...</i>

197
00:15:35,927 --> 00:15:38,096
<i>George of the Jungle.</i>

198
00:15:40,598 --> 00:15:43,768
<i>But that's not
who she saw first.</i>

199
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,770
What!

200
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,985
Get away! Get away! Get away!

201
00:16:04,455 --> 00:16:05,540
Hello.

202
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:08,793
Oh, dear.

203
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:15,091
Feeling better, fella?

204
00:16:15,258 --> 00:16:17,677
Okay. It's that dream, then.

205
00:16:17,844 --> 00:16:21,639
I'm still having that
psycho dream. Hello.

206
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:26,019
- Oh. Oh.
- Oh, no, no! Don't worry! Ape friend.

207
00:16:26,102 --> 00:16:28,354
- Ape make your breakfast.
- What does it want? What does it want?

208
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:33,067
"It" wants its Physician's
Desk Reference, if you don't mind.

209
00:16:33,234 --> 00:16:36,237
Unless you'd rather die
of dengue fever, of course.

210
00:16:36,404 --> 00:16:39,532
That is very funny!

211
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:43,244
I thought I heard
the monkey talk.

212
00:16:43,328 --> 00:16:46,080
But that is totally
understandable, right?

213
00:16:46,247 --> 00:16:48,833
I mean, why wouldn't
an ape read textbooks?

214
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,461
And why wouldn't I find
myself in a tree house...

215
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:56,966
with room service and a Tarzan wannabe,
wearing a, um, um...

216
00:16:57,091 --> 00:16:59,552
- What do you call that thing?
- Butt flap.

217
00:16:59,761 --> 00:17:01,638
Right.

218
00:17:07,518 --> 00:17:08,937
Ooh!

219
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,734
Bit of a shock, I suppose. Yes.

220
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,528
Fever.

221
00:17:16,861 --> 00:17:22,200
Cold compress. Dab her lightly, George.
"Talking monkey".

222
00:17:23,368 --> 00:17:25,745
That's the ticket. Good.

223
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:30,500
Huh? Somethin' funny
about this fella.

224
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:35,588
She's not a "fella", George. She's
a woman, the female of your species.

225
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,216
You mean Ape and George
not brothers?

226
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,553
Well, in a sense,
we are related.

227
00:17:41,719 --> 00:17:44,514
After all, we're both members
of the primate family.

228
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,558
Primate family. Brothers.

229
00:17:46,641 --> 00:17:49,561
I suppose one might claim
that there would...

230
00:17:49,727 --> 00:17:53,648
Mommy, make that monkey
stop talking.

231
00:17:53,815 --> 00:17:58,486
Perhaps I should refrain from speaking
around her, as it seems to upset her.

232
00:18:16,254 --> 00:18:20,258
- What your name?
- Ursula.

233
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:23,511
Ursula Stanhope.

234
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:26,180
- Who are you?
- George.

235
00:18:26,347 --> 00:18:28,892
George Primate.

236
00:18:29,058 --> 00:18:32,604
And that brother Ape.
Ape Primate.

237
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:36,065
Ah! Oh, um...

238
00:18:36,274 --> 00:18:40,111
Okay, I'm gonna
pass out again now.

239
00:18:40,236 --> 00:18:42,280
Bye.

240
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:48,995
It's a sissy white ape.
I would've choked the life out of him...

241
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,707
except that he had two of his
lion buddies jump me from behind.

242
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,043
So in this version,
there are two lions with the white ape?

243
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,629
A minute ago,
there was only one.

244
00:18:57,837 --> 00:19:02,425
H-Hey, the important thing,
Kwame, is that I was outnumbered.

245
00:19:05,053 --> 00:19:06,387
Absolutely.

246
00:19:18,149 --> 00:19:19,859
Ursula!

247
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:35,166
Hi. When I woke up this morning,
I remembered about that lion...

248
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:38,795
and I know you
saved me yesterday.

249
00:19:38,962 --> 00:19:42,257
- And I just wanted to say thank you.
- Ah!

250
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,676
Ooh!

251
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:48,513
Now that I'm feeling better, I realize the
others must think I'm cat food by now.

252
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,267
And I don't want my fian...
this guy that I was with... to worry.

253
00:19:52,475 --> 00:19:55,603
So, so I should probably go
and look for them...

254
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,564
and I was wondering
if you could help me.

255
00:19:57,730 --> 00:20:00,733
Uh... Ursula want to go already?

256
00:20:04,863 --> 00:20:06,906
Okay, George help.
Get trusty doggy.

257
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,992
Oh, you have a dog.
That's great.

258
00:20:09,033 --> 00:20:11,119
Doggy will help find friends.
George call Shep.

259
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:14,414
Shep! Here, boy!

260
00:20:14,581 --> 00:20:17,000
Come on! Here, boy.

261
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,377
Shep!

262
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:25,383
Here comes Shep.
Come on, Shep! Come on, boy!

263
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:29,888
That a boy! Want to play?
Come on! Come on! Come on!

264
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:34,100
Good boy.

265
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:37,979
Come on, boy! Come on!
Good boy, Shep! Come on!

266
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:40,607
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop, stop!

267
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,859
Sit. Sit.

268
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:47,071
Good boy!
Good obedience training.

269
00:20:47,238 --> 00:20:49,657
- George trained from pup.
- That's your dog?

270
00:20:49,824 --> 00:20:53,286
This Shep, George's big,
grey, peanut-lovin' poochie.

271
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,497
Good boy, Shep! Good boy.

272
00:20:56,664 --> 00:20:59,167
Good boy, Shep. Good boy.

273
00:20:59,334 --> 00:21:04,422
- That's a good boy. Wanna shake?
- Huh?

274
00:21:04,589 --> 00:21:08,426
- Good doggy. Be nice.
- Shep.

275
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:13,848
Shake? George. George.

276
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:15,934
George!

277
00:21:22,148 --> 00:21:24,734
- See? Shep shake.
- Oh, George.

278
00:21:24,901 --> 00:21:27,904
He's a big poochie, all right.

279
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:30,114
Does he fetch?

280
00:21:34,244 --> 00:21:36,412
Here, boy. Come on, boy.
Want a stick?

281
00:21:36,579 --> 00:21:39,958
Want a stick? Where's the stick?

282
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,211
Where's the stick, Shep?

283
00:21:43,378 --> 00:21:45,296
Here it is. Here, boy. Fetch!

284
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:50,009
Come on, boy!
Run, run! Run, boy!

285
00:21:50,176 --> 00:21:53,930
Atta boy! Good boy.
Go on, boy! Go get it!

286
00:22:00,603 --> 00:22:02,772
Where'd he go?

287
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:09,195
- Wow!
- No, not in the roses!

288
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,867
Ungawa, Shep!

289
00:22:14,075 --> 00:22:17,036
<i>And so, with the help
of the jungle king's big, grey...</i>

290
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:19,998
<i>peanut-loving poochie,
George and Ursula set out...</i>

291
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:24,210
<i>on a desperate search to find
her fianc... uh, that guy she was with...</i>

292
00:22:24,335 --> 00:22:27,088
Lyle! Lyle!

293
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:32,635
- Ursula! Ursula!
<i>- ...while he desperately searched for her.</i>

294
00:22:32,677 --> 00:22:36,264
<i>But by the end of the afternoon
her desperation had dimmed...</i>

295
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:38,558
That was fantastic!

296
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:41,102
<i>and she had given up
all hope of everything...</i>

297
00:22:41,269 --> 00:22:45,940
<i>except enjoying the jungle king's company from
her precarious perch atop his faithful doggy.</i>

298
00:22:46,107 --> 00:22:49,319
- So, where are we going now?
- To find Tookie-Tookie bird for jungle news.

299
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:52,864
Tookie-Tookie bird. I love that.

300
00:22:52,947 --> 00:22:56,868
<i>Later they rested,
while the tired tusker teethed on a...</i>

301
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,787
<i>Wait a second.
The dog bone is too much. Lose it.</i>

302
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:01,998
<i>That's better.</i>

303
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:07,587
<i>Bongo-gram. What could it mean?</i>

304
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:10,715
Tookie-Tookie!

305
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,681
Tookie say
little monkey in trouble.

306
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:20,767
George investigate.

307
00:23:20,934 --> 00:23:23,686
Tookie-Tookie!

308
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:37,867
What happened?

309
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:42,330
- Oh!
- Where other monkeys?

310
00:23:42,497 --> 00:23:44,541
Where? There?

311
00:23:44,707 --> 00:23:47,293
How many? That many?

312
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:51,130
Lots of monkey.
Then what happened?

313
00:23:53,424 --> 00:23:55,093
Tell George more.

314
00:23:55,218 --> 00:23:57,262
No!

315
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,683
Little monkey say other monkeys
call little monkey "runt".

316
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:06,938
- Not let little monkey play games.
- Poor thing. Hi, monkey.

317
00:24:10,441 --> 00:24:12,527
H-Hi. You okay?

318
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,571
No.

319
00:24:16,614 --> 00:24:19,409
Don't cry.

320
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,204
Huh.

321
00:24:23,746 --> 00:24:26,916
Little monkey like Ursula.

322
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:36,467
- What did you tell him?
- Just watch.

323
00:24:55,695 --> 00:24:57,655
Uh-oh!

324
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:46,287
<i>Meanwhile, back at a really
big footprint in the mud...</i>

325
00:25:49,165 --> 00:25:51,668
Let me through.
What's happening?

326
00:25:51,876 --> 00:25:54,837
This footprint does not
belong to any of my men.

327
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:58,633
See? There's your proof.
The white ape does exist.

328
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:02,804
Now all we have to do is track down
the girl and the ape's in the bag.

329
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:05,807
N-No, seriously. I don't know
if I want to do this again.

330
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:09,477
Ursula need to relax when it come
to vine swinging, for George.

331
00:26:12,188 --> 00:26:15,024
Swing, swing, swing. Come on.

332
00:26:15,191 --> 00:26:17,777
Want George of Jungle to tell you
special vine-swinging secret?

333
00:26:17,902 --> 00:26:20,947
Fine. Tell me all your secrets.

334
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:24,659
George's secrets. Hm!
There's the shortest book ever written.

335
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:25,994
Oh.

336
00:26:26,035 --> 00:26:29,330
Wrap it around your sock for special
George of Jungle foot lock.

337
00:26:30,582 --> 00:26:32,876
- Now, ready to try again?
- No.

338
00:26:47,307 --> 00:26:48,558
Like this, Ursula!

339
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:52,478
<i>â™ª He flies through the air
With the greatest of ease â™ª</i>

340
00:26:52,604 --> 00:26:55,940
<i>â™ª Our daring young man

341
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:56,816
Look, no hands!

342
00:26:56,858 --> 00:27:00,528
<i>â™ª His movements so graceful
All girls he could please â™ª</i>

343
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:05,074
<i>â™ª And with love he is swinging away â™ª</i>

344
00:27:05,241 --> 00:27:08,953
<i>- â™ª He flies through the air with the greatest of ease â™ª</i>
- That's pretty good.

345
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,332
- George, watch out for that...
<i>- â™ª Our daring young man on the... â™ª</i>

346
00:27:12,498 --> 00:27:15,084
tree.

347
00:27:28,097 --> 00:27:30,934
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the king of the jungle.

348
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,071
Where the devil is my egg timer?

349
00:27:44,113 --> 00:27:45,532
- Tookie-Tookie.
- Tookie!

350
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:49,410
I'm fed up with this felonious fowl
stealing everything in the kitchen.

351
00:27:50,787 --> 00:27:54,040
- Miserable creature.
- Tookie-Tookie.

352
00:27:54,082 --> 00:27:56,876
George, what on earth
are you doing?

353
00:27:57,168 --> 00:28:00,421
George just feel like looking
a little special today, that all.

354
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:04,968
Possibly there is a stirring
of special feelings within you?

355
00:28:08,221 --> 00:28:10,890
Uh-huh.

356
00:28:18,982 --> 00:28:22,485
George having stirring
of special feelings right now.

357
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:25,029
I see.

358
00:28:25,238 --> 00:28:28,658
- Good thing she same species, huh?
- Yes.

359
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:31,703
Ape?

360
00:28:31,870 --> 00:28:35,540
Tell George how to make
Ursula George's mate.

361
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:39,419
Please? Brother?

362
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:44,132
First, command her attention by bulging
out your cheeks and pursing your lips.

363
00:28:44,632 --> 00:28:48,469
- Show George.
- All right. Just like this. Watch.

364
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,311
Even puffier.

365
00:28:56,728 --> 00:29:00,315
Next, display your interest
by drawing back your upper lip...

366
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,568
jutting your jaw forward
and exposing your teeth.

367
00:29:03,735 --> 00:29:08,198
- Like this? Like this? Right?
- Now, throw a handful of leaves in the air...

368
00:29:08,323 --> 00:29:12,076
then leap about and hoot
in a dominant fashion.

369
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:19,876
- Like this, Ape?
- Good. She won't be able to resist that.

370
00:29:24,297 --> 00:29:26,216
Ursula!

371
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:28,927
Gosh, this trail's really rough.

372
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,101
"Ursula! Ursula!"

373
00:29:43,441 --> 00:29:46,069
- Hey, come back here.
- They're not abandoning us, are they?

374
00:29:46,277 --> 00:29:47,320
They are threatening.

375
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:48,655
If you don't mind, Kwame...

376
00:29:48,738 --> 00:29:52,867
I have a knack for getting
the most out of my employees.

377
00:29:53,076 --> 00:29:57,080
- Do you mind if I address the porters?
- They only speak Swahili.

378
00:29:57,205 --> 00:30:01,209
Well, I just happen to have
a Swahili phrase book.

379
00:30:01,376 --> 00:30:03,628
Be my guest.

380
00:30:24,983 --> 00:30:27,485
I think our troubles are over.

381
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:32,198
Tell them I'll pay 50 zamoles a man if they'll help
me capture the white ape and bring him back alive.

382
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:36,327
Alive? After he, uh...

383
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:39,497
Well, he pulled Ursula's scrunchie off,
we know that much.

384
00:30:39,664 --> 00:30:43,585
- 50 zamoles a man. What do you say?
- They only speak Swahili.

385
00:30:43,626 --> 00:30:46,212
One hundred zamoles a man
and you got a deal.

386
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:49,674
- Hey, wait a second.
- Done.

387
00:30:51,134 --> 00:30:53,970
<i>Meanwhile, at a very big
and expensive waterfall set...</i>

388
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:57,265
<i>Ursula was amazed that she was lost
in the wilderness with a jungle man.</i>

389
00:30:57,473 --> 00:31:01,769
Here I am, lost in the wilderness
with a jungle man.

390
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:10,612
I should be terrified that no one
will ever find me, but I'm not.

391
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:15,533
- Thank you.
- For what?

392
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:18,077
For this adventure.

393
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:20,580
It's what I've always wanted.

394
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,876
King of jungle
only here to help.

395
00:31:30,882 --> 00:31:33,885
<i>â™ª Mr Boombastic â™ª</i>

<i>- â™ª Mr Lover-Lover â™ª</i>
- George, are you okay?

400
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:48,858
<i>- â™ª Mr Lover-Lover â™ª</i>
- Your face is swelling up like...

401
00:31:49,025 --> 00:31:52,237
<i>- â™ª Ah, Mr Lover-Lover â™ª</i>
- Is something in my teeth?

402
00:32:01,829 --> 00:32:03,206
Okay.

403
00:32:09,212 --> 00:32:10,713
Listen, um...

404
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,343
I'm gonna step outside
for a little air, okay?

405
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:23,601
- Are you sure you threw the leaves?
- Yeah, George threw leaves.

406
00:32:23,768 --> 00:32:26,646
Well, cheer up, old boy.
I spent all day...

407
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:29,065
poring through every book
in the library...

408
00:32:29,274 --> 00:32:32,193
and finally I found this.

409
00:32:33,486 --> 00:32:37,365
It's positively packed full
of human courtship rituals.

410
00:32:37,532 --> 00:32:41,077
Listen.
"What's a nice girl like you...

411
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:44,289
"doing in a plane like this?"

412
00:32:51,296 --> 00:32:53,214
Go for it.

413
00:32:59,637 --> 00:33:02,015
- Hi.
- Hi.

414
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:10,190
What... Oh.

415
00:33:13,985 --> 00:33:18,364
- Did you fight a crocodile for this?
- Oh. No, George not fight.

416
00:33:18,448 --> 00:33:21,034
Crocodile have toothache.

417
00:33:21,201 --> 00:33:25,997
George pull tooth.
Crocodile give to George after. Gift.

418
00:33:26,581 --> 00:33:27,874
Good ju-ju.

419
00:33:28,499 --> 00:33:31,961
- Ju-ju?
- Good luck. Protection.

420
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:38,760
I have something like that too.
Want to see?

421
00:33:40,303 --> 00:33:42,222
It's not worth anything.

422
00:33:42,388 --> 00:33:46,309
I found it in a cereal box
when I was ten years old.

423
00:33:46,517 --> 00:33:49,938
It's my good luck. My ju-ju.

424
00:33:53,316 --> 00:33:56,528
- Can I...
- Oh.

425
00:34:09,499 --> 00:34:11,751
I want you to have that.

426
00:34:11,834 --> 00:34:13,920
For George?

427
00:34:15,588 --> 00:34:18,841
That's the nicest present
George ever get.

428
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,719
Thank you.

429
00:34:31,938 --> 00:34:34,983
- All right, man.
- Yeah.

430
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:38,695
It dancin' time.

431
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:44,242
- Ursula, wanna dance?
- Oh, no. Thanks.

432
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:47,829
- I'd be too embarrassed.
- What mean "embarrassed"?

433
00:34:47,954 --> 00:34:52,292
That's when you feel stupid
in front of other people.

434
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:55,086
You know, like
they're judging you.

435
00:34:55,211 --> 00:34:57,714
- You've never felt that?
- No.

436
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:00,300
There are no other people.

437
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:02,635
- Good point.
- George not feel stupid.

438
00:35:02,635 --> 00:35:05,471
Sometimes George smash
into tree, and sometime...

439
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:14,606
Sometimes George fall out of tree house,
but not feel stupid.

440
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,025
Something good
always happen after.

441
00:35:17,609 --> 00:35:20,069
George just lucky, I guess.

442

457
00:36:21,422 --> 00:36:23,883
<i>â™ª I've been waiting for you all my life â™ª</i>

458
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,927
<i>â™ª Hoping for a miracle â™ª</i>

459
00:36:26,094 --> 00:36:30,765
<i>â™ª I've been waiting day and night
Day and night â™ª</i>

460
00:36:30,932 --> 00:36:35,270
<i>â™ª I've been waiting for you all my life

461
00:36:35,436 --> 00:36:40,066
<i>â™ª I've been waiting day and night
I burn for you â™ª</i>

462
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:56,666
<i>And so it came to pass
that George of the Jungle...</i>

463
00:36:56,833 --> 00:37:00,378
<i>attended his first co-ed dance.</i>

464
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:10,555
<i>But his rapturous rendezvous with the
urban heiress was to be short-lived...</i>

465
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:16,227
<i>as the very next morning, Kwame and
his men were drawing dangerously close.</i>

466
00:37:16,394 --> 00:37:21,983
<i>That is, dangerously close to shoving
a coconut up Lyle's sleeping bag.</i>

467
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,985
That's it! I've had it!

468
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:28,239
I am the richest, smartest, handsomest
guy here, so I get to go first.

469
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:36,831
There's an elephant around here.

470
00:37:36,915 --> 00:37:40,627
Bad guy falls in poop.
Classical element of physical comedy.

471
00:37:40,835 --> 00:37:44,339
Now comes the part where we throw
our heads back and laugh. Ready?

472
00:37:44,505 --> 00:37:46,841
Ready.

473
00:37:51,179 --> 00:37:54,557
Those were nowhere near
properly digested.

474
00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:57,644
In case anybody's
wondering, I'm okay.

475
00:37:59,312 --> 00:38:01,523
Have you cleaned my lighter yet?

476
00:38:10,782 --> 00:38:12,408
Come on, come on.

477
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:18,540
That was Ursula.
Did you hear that?

478
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:21,376
She's alive. Ursula...

479
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:24,796
Why don't you bring on a brass band
while you're at it, you nit?

480
00:38:24,837 --> 00:38:27,799
We gotta be stealthy here, right?

481
00:38:27,924 --> 00:38:30,343
Stealthy. Right.

482
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:38,476
Party time.
We'll take it from here.

483
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,699
Get off!

484
00:38:57,287 --> 00:38:59,789
It's him!

485
00:38:59,998 --> 00:39:04,335
Hey, it's a dude. I told you
there weren't no white ape.

486
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:07,839
You dragged me all the way up here to look
at some guy in a leopard-skin bikini.

487
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:10,300
If I wanted to see
that, I could've stayed in Miami.

488
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,759
Wait a second.

489
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:16,055
The white ape is a man?
Let me at him.

490
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:19,642
Hang on. Could you, uh, see
if he's dangerous?

491
00:39:19,809 --> 00:39:22,812
Here, boy!
Where's my little doggy?

492
00:39:22,979 --> 00:39:24,606
I've got a feeling he's not.

493
00:39:24,772 --> 00:39:26,774
Okay. I'll go first.

494
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:29,652
If he gets aggressive,
I'll scare him off with this.

495
00:39:29,986 --> 00:39:33,823
- I thought that was a lighter.
- It is a lighter, but he doesn't know that.

496
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:42,415
Ursula, it's me.

497
00:39:42,582 --> 00:39:47,420
Lyle. Your man.
I've come for you. Are you okay?

498
00:39:51,382 --> 00:39:53,176
Ursula!

499
00:39:53,593 --> 00:39:56,471
- Lyle, what are you doing here?
- Thank God.

500
00:39:56,512 --> 00:40:00,433
Mushy bear, you're safe.
I don't believe it!

501
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:04,771
Oh, I was so afraid
for your safety.

502
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,402
Lyle! Don't get all smoochy
and disgusting with me, okay?

503
00:40:11,528 --> 00:40:13,780
I remember what you did
when that lion came.

504
00:40:13,947 --> 00:40:18,576
What are you talking about?
I was fighting the lion the whole time.

505
00:40:18,743 --> 00:40:21,871
You were just so terrified
you don't remember.

506
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:26,084
- I remember George, that's who I remember.
- George?

507
00:40:26,209 --> 00:40:28,378
Look over there.
What do you see?

508
00:40:30,964 --> 00:40:33,091
- An elephant.
- But what has the elephant got?

509
00:40:37,595 --> 00:40:40,723
- Fleas.
- Ivory! White gold.

510
00:40:40,848 --> 00:40:45,186
Listen, Ursula, I have no idea what
you're talking about. Can we just go?

511
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:48,022
- George!
- Ursula!

512
00:40:48,064 --> 00:40:49,941
Ready...

513
00:40:50,149 --> 00:40:52,318
aim...

514
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:59,534
Run, Shep! Run for your life!

515
00:40:59,701 --> 00:41:01,703
Did that monkey just speak?

516
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:03,955
That monkey just spoke.

517
00:41:04,038 --> 00:41:06,040
- I knew it.
- He talked.

518
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:08,126
- Shoot it now.
- Huh?

519
00:41:08,251 --> 00:41:12,255
With the tranquillizer gun, idiot!
That ape's worth a fortune.

520
00:41:12,422 --> 00:41:14,215
No!

521
00:41:14,382 --> 00:41:17,010
Stop, or I'll shoot!

522
00:41:25,518 --> 00:41:27,437
- No!
- No!

523
00:41:27,437 --> 00:41:32,901
George!

524
00:41:33,067 --> 00:41:37,155
<i>Whew! Okay, kids, let's settle down
and review the important information.</i>

525
00:41:37,322 --> 00:41:39,449
<i>Lyle is a big doofus.
Poor George was really shot...</i>

526
00:41:39,574 --> 00:41:42,202
<i>but can't die because,
let's face it, he's the hero.</i>

527
00:41:42,368 --> 00:41:45,747
<i>So, the naturally concerned and
preternaturally wealthy Ursula Stanhope...</i>

528
00:41:45,955 --> 00:41:49,209
<i>whisked George off on a private jet
bound for the country of his birth...</i>

529
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:52,295
<i>where he would get the finest
medical treatment available.</i>

530
00:41:52,462 --> 00:41:56,466
I'm gonna get you the finest
medical treatment available.

531
00:41:56,633 --> 00:42:00,803
<i>As for those pesky, pernicious
and putrid poachers, Max and Thor...</i>

532
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:04,224
<i>they awaited their fate
in the Bujumbura jail.</i>

533
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,935
You two, out.

534
00:42:07,101 --> 00:42:10,355
- Acquitted?
- No, deported.

535
00:42:10,522 --> 00:42:13,942
<i>Meanwhile, Kwame and his men faced
the next-to-impossible task...</i>

536
00:42:14,025 --> 00:42:18,613
of picking out George's assailant
from a line-up of the usual suspects.

537
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:21,282
Too short. Too sweaty.

538
00:42:21,449 --> 00:42:25,203
Wait a second! That's the guy.
That's the guy who shot him.

539
00:42:25,286 --> 00:42:28,039
- I never forget a face.
- Me?

540
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:38,591
No, Max. Forget about it. I do not want
to listen to any more of your ideas.

541
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,012
You'll like this one. We're gonna steal
Georgie-boy's talking ape.

542
00:42:43,137 --> 00:42:45,723
- You mean, back up the mountain?
- Thor, that ape is our ticket...

543
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:48,476
out of poaching
and into show business.

544
00:42:48,643 --> 00:42:51,646
- No.
- Think about it. We got a talking ape.

545
00:42:51,688 --> 00:42:53,731
What do Siegfried and Roy have?

546
00:42:53,898 --> 00:42:56,192
- Sequins?
- Exactly.

547
00:42:56,401 --> 00:42:59,320
Get ready for room service,
mate, and girls.

548
00:42:59,487 --> 00:43:01,739
We're gettin' our ape
and going to Vegas.

549
00:43:01,781 --> 00:43:04,951
By next weekend,
we'll be headlining at the Tropicana.

550
00:43:05,034 --> 00:43:07,620
- Nobody is gonna stop us.
- Right.

551
00:43:07,787 --> 00:43:10,540
George of the Jungle
must be halfway to Frisco by now.

552
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:14,335
<i>Ah, but the plotting poachers
were only half correct...</i>

553
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:18,965
<i>for at that very moment, our handsome
hero was all the way to San Francisco.</i>

554
00:43:19,132 --> 00:43:22,302
- Yes, Mother, I'm safe.
- You're sure you didn't catch dengue fever?

555
00:43:22,468 --> 00:43:24,470
No, Mother, I did not
catch dengue fever.

556
00:43:24,554 --> 00:43:26,931
<i>- Well, how's your temperature?</i>
- Normal.

557
00:43:27,098 --> 00:43:30,226
- Colour of your tongue?
- Pink.

558
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:32,437
- What about your hmm-hmm?
- Regular.

559
00:43:32,604 --> 00:43:35,648
Now, Lyle.
How is my darling future son-in-law?

560
00:43:36,191 --> 00:43:37,901
Lyle is...

561
00:43:40,570 --> 00:43:44,115
He's happy to be home, Mom.
Could you hold on one second?

562
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:52,832
George, please don't call any animals
into the car, okay? Thanks.

563
00:43:53,041 --> 00:43:55,501
Mom? You there?

564
00:43:55,668 --> 00:43:58,880
Mom, hold on. I'm losing you again.
George. George. No.

565
00:43:59,047 --> 00:44:01,507
Are you paying any attention?
This is important.

566
00:44:01,716 --> 00:44:06,930
No. I know it's important. Geo-Geo...
George. George. Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

567
00:44:08,223 --> 00:44:11,351
This faster than riding big,
great, peanut-loving poochie Shep.

568
00:44:11,434 --> 00:44:13,811
Love you, Mom. Gotta go.
Bye. Watch out for that...

569
00:44:15,813 --> 00:44:17,190
Ooh!

570
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,325
So, what do you
think of my jungle?

571
00:44:27,492 --> 00:44:30,036
This very high tree house.

572
00:44:30,203 --> 00:44:32,413
Good place to call friends from.
Sound carry.

573
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:34,332
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

574
00:44:38,711 --> 00:44:40,630
The neighbours.

575
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:44,342
- Give it a rest!
- We're ten storeys up, George.

576
00:44:44,425 --> 00:44:47,679
I don't think the animals
can make it up here.

577
00:44:47,845 --> 00:44:50,306
Oh, sure. George know that.

578
00:44:51,516 --> 00:44:53,434
George know that.

579
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:05,405
You must be tired. I'll, um...

580
00:45:05,572 --> 00:45:09,367
make the couch up for you
to sleep in the living room.

581
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:13,204
Oh, no. George sleep here
in tree house.

582
00:45:13,454 --> 00:45:15,373
Okay. Good night.

583
00:45:18,167 --> 00:45:20,712
Sleep sweet, Ursula.

584
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,131
Sleep sweet, George.

585
00:45:26,926 --> 00:45:28,219
Ooh.

586
00:45:30,138 --> 00:45:32,223
<i>Well, Ursula's fiancÃ©
is in prison...</i>

587
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:34,601
<i>and there's a jungle man
sleeping on her balcony.</i>

588
00:45:34,767 --> 00:45:37,103
<i>- She could use a best friend right now.</i>
- Hi.

589
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:39,147
- Hi.
- I got here as fast as I could.

590
00:45:39,272 --> 00:45:41,816
- Where is he?
- He's under the waterf... He's in the shower.

591
00:45:41,983 --> 00:45:43,818
Not any more.

592
00:45:43,985 --> 00:45:46,196
- George.
- Oh. Bad waterfall.

593
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:50,491
First water get hot, then George slip
on this strange, yellow rock, and... Oh!

594
00:45:52,285 --> 00:45:56,289
- Hi. George of Jungle.
- Charmed, I'm sure.

595
00:45:56,456 --> 00:46:00,752
George. Um, take this big book.

596
00:46:01,169 --> 00:46:04,422
Whoop! Cover the booty,
get into decent clothes.

597
00:46:04,589 --> 00:46:05,381
Sorry, Betsy.

598
00:46:05,381 --> 00:46:06,174
- Bye.
- No problem.

599
00:46:06,216 --> 00:46:09,802
- Okay.
- I see why they made him king of the jungle.

600
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:12,013
Betsy, I am
in trouble here, okay?

601
00:46:12,305 --> 00:46:15,517
How am I gonna tell my parents
that my fiancÃ©'s in an African jail...

602
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,352
and that I brought home
a jungle man?

603
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:20,104
You are totally stuck
on George, huh?

604
00:46:20,271 --> 00:46:23,024
No, I am not!

605
00:46:23,191 --> 00:46:27,445
- Can I have him then?
- Okay, let's think. Think, think, think.

606
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:31,199
Think, think, think, think, think, think, think,
think. What am I gonna do about tomorrow?

607
00:46:31,241 --> 00:46:33,660
Tomorrow is your engagement party,
and unless they give day passes...

608
00:46:33,826 --> 00:46:36,829
out of Bujumbura Jail,
Lyle is not likely to attend.

609
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:40,625
So tell 'em the truth and don't
worry about it and take George.

610
00:46:40,917 --> 00:46:44,087
- He can back up your story. Right?
- Yeah. All right.

611
00:46:44,128 --> 00:46:46,172
So I'll tell my dad
first thing in the morning.

612
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:50,301
Make it second thing. First thing, I
suggest you buy jungle man some clothes.

613
00:46:54,764 --> 00:46:57,809
Nice butt flap.

614
00:47:03,022 --> 00:47:05,984
<i>Being of a conservative mind
regarding gender roles...</i>

615
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,152
<i>Ursula Stanhope
wasted no time...</i>

616
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:11,823
<i>in taking George of the Jungle
to a fine haberdasher.</i>

617
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:19,831
- And this is Neiman Marcus.
- Whoo! They have big, shiny cave.

618
00:47:20,456 --> 00:47:24,252
Hello. Would you like
to sample our new fragrance?

619
00:47:24,419 --> 00:47:26,337
Thank you.

620
00:47:32,343 --> 00:47:36,431
<i>Later, in the men's department, after
discovering his long-lost brothers...</i>

621
00:47:36,598 --> 00:47:41,144
<i>the jungle king was pleased to find
he looked pretty good in Armani.</i>

622
00:47:41,561 --> 00:47:43,146
Pretty darn good.

623
00:47:46,399 --> 00:47:48,234
Watch out, man!

624
00:47:48,401 --> 00:47:51,821
Why everyone run around crazy,
like antelope in mating season?

625
00:47:51,988 --> 00:47:55,200
They're just trying to make a living. It's...
different kind of jungle here, George.

626
00:47:55,366 --> 00:47:58,077
It's survival of the fittest.
Dog eat dog.

627
00:47:58,161 --> 00:48:01,414
- "Dog eat dog"... Dog eat dog here?
- No, that's not what I meant.

628
00:48:01,581 --> 00:48:03,541
George never bring Shep here.
Uh-uh. Never.

629
00:48:03,708 --> 00:48:07,295
<i>Every story gets to have a really big
coincidence, and here's ours.</i>

630
00:48:07,462 --> 00:48:10,798
<i>Who should see them walking down
the street but Ursula's meddling mother?</i>

631
00:48:10,924 --> 00:48:12,926
Uh, yes, uh, Lyle van de Groot,
please.

632
00:48:13,092 --> 00:48:16,137
<i>- I'm sorry. He's not back from Africa.</i>
- He's not?

633
00:48:16,304 --> 00:48:18,264
<i>No. I'm sorry.</i>

634
00:48:18,848 --> 00:48:20,808
<i>Meanwhile, back on Ape Mountain...</i>

635
00:48:20,975 --> 00:48:25,146
<i>George's friends were going positively
ga-ga from missing the jungle king.</i>

636
00:48:25,438 --> 00:48:26,981
No!

637
00:48:27,315 --> 00:48:30,360
Oh, look at this.
It's ruined. Ruined!

638
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:32,695
Shep, come here at once.

639
00:48:32,737 --> 00:48:35,240
Come on!

640
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:41,204
How many times do I have to tell you?
My violin bow is not a chew toy!

641
00:48:41,329 --> 00:48:42,914
Bad dog!

642
00:48:43,122 --> 00:48:46,334
And you! Out of my sight,
you feathered fool.

643
00:48:47,877 --> 00:48:52,590
No! Not on the tree house!
I'll smack you...

644
00:48:55,677 --> 00:48:57,720
<i>Ursula, it's Mother.
Pick up the phone...</i>

645
00:48:57,845 --> 00:49:00,974
<i>and tell me who that man was
I saw you strolling with today.</i>

646
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:05,144
<i>And where is Lyle?
We must discuss the engagement party.</i>

647
00:49:05,311 --> 00:49:10,358
<i>I know you're there, Ursula. Pick up the phone
and tell me why you have been avoiding me.</i>

648
00:49:10,483 --> 00:49:12,819
<i>Pick up the phone!</i>

649
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:18,992
Well, I think that
was an overreaction.

650
00:49:20,368 --> 00:49:22,370
Just make sure you stay here
while I'm at work...

651
00:49:22,537 --> 00:49:27,000
and you can watch TV
and eat and relax.

652
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:29,419
And I'll be back as soon as I can.
Just stay here.

653
00:49:29,586 --> 00:49:34,757
<i>"Stay here"? George is king of the jungle. No
four walls built by modern man can contain him.</i>

654
00:49:34,924 --> 00:49:39,012
Not true. George have every intention
of doing exactly what Ursula say.

655
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:44,350
<i>- Really? Is that so?</i>
- For a while.

656
00:49:44,434 --> 00:49:50,023
<i>And at that very moment, Betsy and Ursula were on
their way to break the news about Lyle to her father.</i>

657
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:53,568
- Good luck, kiddo.
- Surprise!

658
00:49:57,238 --> 00:50:00,700
Ursula, welcome home,
sweetheart...

659
00:50:00,867 --> 00:50:02,911
and happy engagement day.

660
00:50:03,203 --> 00:50:05,288
<i>â™ª Chock Full O' Nuts â™ª</i>

661
00:50:05,455 --> 00:50:09,083
<i>â™ª The heavenly coffee â™ª</i>

662
00:50:09,209 --> 00:50:13,213
<i>- The coffee that brings you together.
- â™ª When you're in love â™ª</i>

663
00:50:15,173 --> 00:50:20,053
Now George understand. George get
coffee, then Ursula want George.

664
00:50:33,066 --> 00:50:35,068
Java Java Java Java Java Java
Java Java Java Java Java Java.

665
00:50:35,276 --> 00:50:38,530
<i>So the low has moved offshore.
High pressure's built a ridge in.</i>

666
00:50:38,655 --> 00:50:40,740
<i>The weather
is absolutely gorgeous.</i>

667
00:50:40,907 --> 00:50:43,409
<i>- If you're not outside, you oughta be!</i>
- Who, me?

668
00:50:43,576 --> 00:50:45,870
- I mean you.
- Oh.

669
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:47,956
Okay!

670
00:50:48,039 --> 00:50:50,333
<i>And so, jazzed on java...</i>

671
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:54,170
<i>George of the Jungle made his way
into the city by the bay.</i>

672
00:50:56,673 --> 00:50:58,591
Whoo!

673
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:01,261
<i>Quickly taking to tourism,
the jungle king enjoyed...</i>

674
00:51:01,427 --> 00:51:03,638
<i>the first drive-through
dining of his life...</i>

675
00:51:03,805 --> 00:51:07,058
<i>and strolled the city streets until
he found something so scintillating...</i>

676
00:51:07,225 --> 00:51:09,227
<i>- he had to say:</i>
- Ooh!

677
00:51:19,988 --> 00:51:21,990
<i>But nothing excited
the jungle king more...</i>

678
00:51:22,198 --> 00:51:25,118
<i>than the sight of the biggest
rope bridge he had ever seen.</i>

679
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:29,289
Ooh. Yeah.

680
00:51:49,642 --> 00:51:51,561
- Help!
- Ooh.

681
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:53,980
Somebody help!

682
00:52:06,576 --> 00:52:10,496
- To swing or not to swing?
- Help!

683
00:52:13,833 --> 00:52:14,959
Swing.

684
00:52:25,053 --> 00:52:30,058
<i>As the king of the jungle quickly calculated the
angle and velocity of his next big swing...</i>

685
00:52:30,183 --> 00:52:33,019
<i>Ursula felt like jumping
off a bridge herself.</i>

686
00:52:33,478 --> 00:52:37,357
I feel so guilty.
I don't know what I'm going to do.

687
00:52:37,524 --> 00:52:41,694
First thing: I suggest you tell your
father what you came here to tell him.

688
00:52:41,819 --> 00:52:43,988
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, honey. Take a look at this.

689
00:52:44,197 --> 00:52:47,575
The most remarkable thing
is happening on the Bay Bridge.

690
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,578
<i>...where strong winds
have carried him to the Bay Bridge.</i>

691
00:52:50,703 --> 00:52:53,498
<i>Our own Valerie Devlin
is live on the scene. Valerie?</i>

692
00:52:53,581 --> 00:52:55,792
Thank you, Terilyn.
We do have a breaking story...

693
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,335
<i>- at the Bay Bridge...</i>
- Help!

694
00:52:57,377 --> 00:52:58,419
<i>...where a parasailor dangles...</i>

695
00:52:58,503 --> 00:53:02,423
<i>- helplessly, 500 feet above the water.</i>
- Please! Hurry up! Help!

696
00:53:06,553 --> 00:53:09,430
<i>There's no word on who
this lone daredevil is.</i>

697
00:53:09,472 --> 00:53:12,767
- That's George.
<i>- He appears to have some kind of rope in his hand.</i>

698
00:53:12,934 --> 00:53:15,103
<i>- He might be preparing to swing on it.</i>
- I gotta go.

699
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:35,957
Excuse me, sir.
I have to get on this boat.

700
00:53:47,427 --> 00:53:51,014
Hey, fella. George of Jungle.
Need a vine?

701
00:53:51,181 --> 00:53:54,642
Hey, thanks a lot, man.
G-Get me out of this stuff, huh?

702
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,444
- Thanks, man.
- Oh, don't mention it.

703
00:54:04,527 --> 00:54:08,072
King of jungle only here to help!

704
00:54:13,912 --> 00:54:16,581
- George!
- Ursula!

705
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:40,021
Watch out for that...

706
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:48,738
George!

707
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,615
- Ursula!
- What are you doing? Are you okay?

708
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:54,744
- You just saved that man's life!
- George just lucky, I guess.

709
00:54:56,454 --> 00:54:59,499
Ooh. This coffee stuff
really work good.

710
00:55:00,708 --> 00:55:04,546
<i>...one of the most daring rescues

- Ohh.

715
00:55:19,310 --> 00:55:22,272
<i>Meanwhile, back in the jungle...</i>

716
00:55:22,313 --> 00:55:25,692
There's five stinkin' apes out there.
Which one are we takin' to Vegas?

717
00:55:25,859 --> 00:55:29,279
- The one who's playing chess.
- Checkmate.

718
00:55:34,909 --> 00:55:36,327
- Yes!
- Sweet dreams, banana breath.

719
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:37,245
Grab him.

720
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:40,790
Tookie. Go find George.

721
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:44,127
Tookie-Tookie.

722
00:55:51,885 --> 00:55:53,469
Thor.

723
00:55:58,808 --> 00:56:02,020
Let's get him in the cage
while he's still under. Come on.

724
00:56:04,814 --> 00:56:07,525
<i>As the pesky poachers
grunted and groaned...</i>

<i>by helping her discover

731
00:56:27,045 --> 00:56:30,423
- Make jungle call. Then you'll feel brave.
- No. I can't.

732
00:56:30,590 --> 00:56:33,176
- Come on. Big breath. Here. Support voice.
- N-No. No, no, no.

733
00:56:33,343 --> 00:56:35,386
- Ursula, please? Pl... Please?
- No, no!

734

- Big. Brave. Queen of jungle. Come on, Ursula.

735
00:56:52,820 --> 00:56:54,822
- Wow.
- Not bad for beginner.

736
00:56:55,073 --> 00:56:57,534

<i>- Emboldened with jungle ju-ju...</i>

737

738
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:06,543
Mother, Daddy,
I love you both very much.

739
00:57:06,709 --> 00:57:08,753
I have something
very important to tell you...

740
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,214
and I hope you'll understand.

741
00:57:11,381 --> 00:57:16,344
- I don't want to marry Lyle any more.
- We understand, dear.

742
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:21,266
<i>Just kidding.</i>

743
00:57:24,936 --> 00:57:29,190
<i>- The young Miss Stanhope proceeded to spill the beans...</i>
- So, anyway, I went to the jungle...

744
00:57:29,232 --> 00:57:31,025
<i>very quickly...</i>

745
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:41,870
<i>until she got to
the important part at the end.</i>

746
00:57:42,078 --> 00:57:47,792
Then Lyle shot him. So Lyle
is in jail and George is with me...

747
00:57:48,001 --> 00:57:49,919
and I don't want to marry
Lyle any more.

748
00:57:50,044 --> 00:57:53,506
I knew it. It's that swinging man
from the bridge.

749
00:57:53,673 --> 00:57:55,508
I saw you smooching on TV.

750
00:57:55,675 --> 00:57:58,761
- Mother, we weren't smooching...
- How could you do this to me?

751
00:57:58,887 --> 00:58:01,723
Don't you realize the calibre of people
who are going to be here?

752
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:05,393
- Calm down, Beatrice, and let her say...
- I thought we would be introducing them...

753
00:58:05,518 --> 00:58:09,522
to Lyle van de Groot, not some
wild man you found in the jungle.

754
00:58:09,689 --> 00:58:12,275
Beatrice, this is supposed to be
her wedding, not yours.

755
00:58:12,442 --> 00:58:15,320
- So?
- Beatrice, I know you're upset...

756
00:58:15,445 --> 00:58:18,615
and so am I, but we can't force her
to marry someone against her will.

757
00:58:18,781 --> 00:58:21,701
- Why not?
- Mom. Dad.

758
00:58:22,118 --> 00:58:26,039
I'm ready to go out there and apologize to
everybody and tell them what really happened.

759
00:58:26,164 --> 00:58:28,166
Absolutely not!

760
00:58:28,249 --> 00:58:31,961
As far as I'm concerned, you...
you caught one of those viruses.

761
00:58:32,086 --> 00:58:34,547
Yes, one of those dreadful
jungle viruses...

762
00:58:34,714 --> 00:58:36,883
that get nice girls all confused.

763
00:58:37,008 --> 00:58:41,930
And if Lyle survives that awful jail, you
will simply have to kiss and make up.

764
00:58:42,013 --> 00:58:45,850
As for this evening, we will hold
our heads high and we will carry on.

765
00:58:46,017 --> 00:58:50,313
Now, darling, where is that charming
young friend of yours?

766
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:53,149
- Well, where is he?
- I don't know. He's around here someplace.

767
00:58:53,316 --> 00:58:54,692
Well, find him.
We haven't got all day.

768
00:58:54,734 --> 00:58:56,486
- Oh, Ursula, look!
- Oh, great!

769
00:58:56,569 --> 00:59:01,908
How wonderful! And look at Richard's
exquisite figurines of you and darling Lyle.

770
00:59:04,369 --> 00:59:06,371
George, watch out for that...

771
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:17,799
Mom. Dad. This is George.

772
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:20,218
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Ursula.

773
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,970
How do you do?

774
00:59:36,943 --> 00:59:40,113
It is always such a pleasure
to see you, Mr. Mayor.

775
00:59:40,321 --> 00:59:42,782
And, you know, it's so nice
to get away from City Hall...

776
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:45,410
and be around some normal people
for a change.

777
00:59:45,451 --> 00:59:50,498
Well, we are perfectly normal, I assure
you... in an exceptional way, of course.

778
00:59:50,665 --> 00:59:54,002
Of course.
A-And what about this guy, Lyle?

779
00:59:54,168 --> 00:59:57,463
You know, I'd really like to meet the man you
deem good enough to marry your daughter.

780
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,967
Oh, well, unfortunately Lyle
is busy at the moment...

781
01:00:01,092 --> 01:00:03,136
uh, tending to some legal affairs.

782
01:00:03,178 --> 01:00:05,305
Some pate, Mr. Mayor?

783
01:00:05,305 --> 01:00:09,017
- You know, I never touch that stuff.
- Oh.

784
01:00:09,142 --> 01:00:11,144
- I had a lovely time.
- Would you excuse us, please?

785
01:00:11,186 --> 01:00:12,020
Excuse me, Dr Goldblum.

786
01:00:12,145 --> 01:00:15,815
It's 7:30. Do you know where
your jungle man is?

787
01:00:18,985 --> 01:00:22,113
So this is what you were doing
in the jungle. Clever girl.

788
01:00:22,197 --> 01:00:26,659
Yeah. Um, he swung me on vines
and fed me coconut milk.

789
01:00:26,743 --> 01:00:29,495
- I knew it.
- He's not a real meat loaf, is he?

790
01:00:29,662 --> 01:00:32,332
No. I mean, he's not brainy...

791
01:00:32,457 --> 01:00:35,460
in that doctor, lawyer,
banker way...

792
01:00:35,501 --> 01:00:38,087
but he has something else.

793
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:41,966
- He has a...
- Sensual intelligence.

794
01:00:42,091 --> 01:00:44,052
"Sensual intelligence".

795
01:00:44,177 --> 01:00:48,139
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

796
01:00:48,306 --> 01:00:50,225
What is it with chicks
and horses, huh?

797
01:01:10,078 --> 01:01:13,373
George, how are you this evening?

798
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:18,336
Pretty sharp threads there,
uh... George, right?

799
01:01:18,503 --> 01:01:20,838
- Yeah. Where're you based?
- The jungle.

800
01:01:21,005 --> 01:01:23,091
I hear ya.
We cut our teeth in New York also.

801
01:01:23,216 --> 01:01:26,386
Eh, you considering a position
with Stanhope? That could be fruitful.

802
01:01:26,553 --> 01:01:29,389
Fruitful? This place not so fruitful.
Nobody here have big coconuts.

803
01:01:36,354 --> 01:01:37,772
George.

804
01:01:37,814 --> 01:01:39,440
I wa... Oh.

805
01:01:39,607 --> 01:01:42,527
Would you mind
stepping outside with me...

806
01:01:42,694 --> 01:01:44,863
Thank you so much...
for just a moment?

807
01:01:45,029 --> 01:01:47,407
Sure.

808
01:01:49,868 --> 01:01:52,662
- Hello, Beatrice.
- Hello, Ella.

809
01:01:52,829 --> 01:01:55,039
Well, we haven't been friends
for very long, George...

810
01:01:55,081 --> 01:01:57,500
but I already think I know
something about you.

811
01:01:57,667 --> 01:02:02,964
- Oh?
- You are in love with my daughter.

812
01:02:03,131 --> 01:02:07,635
- Oh, Mrs. Ursula not so dumb.
- George.

813
01:02:07,844 --> 01:02:12,974
My concern, however, is that Ursula
seems to reciprocate your feelings...

814
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:15,685
and that does present
a problem to me.

815
01:02:17,187 --> 01:02:20,899
You see,
you and Ursula together...

816
01:02:20,982 --> 01:02:24,068
would be unbefitting
her social stature.

817
01:02:24,235 --> 01:02:28,656
You see? Let me put it in a way
you might understand.

818
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:30,783
Where you come from...

819
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:35,038
zebras marry zebras
and leopards marry leopards.

820
01:02:35,205 --> 01:02:37,874
Stripes with stripes,
spots with spots.

821
01:02:37,957 --> 01:02:42,587
Well, Ursula is a stripe
and you are a spot...

822
01:02:42,712 --> 01:02:46,758
one which I intend to have removed
as soon as possible.

823
01:02:47,842 --> 01:02:50,220
So you no want Ursula
to love George.

824
01:02:50,345 --> 01:02:53,890
I would rather have my tongue nailed to
this table every morning at breakfast.

825
01:02:54,265 --> 01:02:56,726
- That hurt.
- Not as much as you will if you do anything...

826
01:02:56,768 --> 01:02:59,938
to screw up my daughter's marriage
to Lyle van de Groot.

827
01:03:00,021 --> 01:03:03,942
When Lyle returns, this wedding
will proceed as planned.

828
01:03:04,025 --> 01:03:07,403
If you do anything to upset that...

829
01:03:07,570 --> 01:03:11,282
I will remove your reason
for wearing a loin cloth.

830
01:03:12,617 --> 01:03:14,410
Steak tartare, Mrs Stanhope?

831
01:03:14,577 --> 01:03:18,915
Oh, no, no. Thank you.
I've had quite enough protein for today.

832
01:03:19,123 --> 01:03:21,793
Have a pleasant evening,
Mr. Jungle.

833
01:03:47,110 --> 01:03:49,612
Tookie? Tookie!

834
01:03:49,654 --> 01:03:54,325
Tookie.
George so happy to see Tookie.

835
01:03:58,663 --> 01:04:02,333
Ape kidnapped? Ape ape-napped?

836
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,794
George save Ape!

837
01:04:06,588 --> 01:04:08,965
Ursula.

838
01:05:04,521 --> 01:05:08,691
Well, of course he went back to the
jungle. Where else would go... the Hague?

839
01:05:08,775 --> 01:05:10,818
But why would he leave
without saying goodbye?

840
01:05:10,985 --> 01:05:15,365
Well, personally I think he acted
rather sensibly. Showed good character.

841
01:05:15,406 --> 01:05:18,701
He understands that he belongs there,
you belong here.

842
01:05:18,910 --> 01:05:22,288
It's really all a question
of stripes and spots.

843
01:05:22,455 --> 01:05:25,375
What? Oh, no.

844
01:05:25,416 --> 01:05:27,919
You got to him.
Mother, what did you say?

845
01:05:27,961 --> 01:05:30,880
I simply said that if he
really cared for you...

846
01:05:31,047 --> 01:05:35,301
he'd leave you alone and let you
get on with your life and marry Lyle.

847
01:05:35,468 --> 01:05:38,137
- I am not marrying Lyle, Mother.
- Beatrice, perhaps we should just...

848
01:05:38,304 --> 01:05:41,266
Arthur! Now, Ursula darling,
don't be ridiculous.

849
01:05:41,432 --> 01:05:45,103
There's a big difference between marriageable
material and a fling in the jungle.

850
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:48,147
"A fling in the jungle"?
"A fling in the jungle".

851
01:05:48,314 --> 01:05:50,233
Who says I had
a fling in the jungle?

852
01:05:50,441 --> 01:05:53,152
You don't think you can
fool your mother, do you?

853
01:05:53,361 --> 01:05:57,198
You've been head over heels for that ape
ever since you brought him here.

854
01:05:57,282 --> 01:06:02,328
Now, Ursula, that kind of love
is fleeting. You'll get over it.

855
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:12,547
- Did you just say "love"?
- No.

856
01:06:12,589 --> 01:06:13,381
You did.

857
01:06:13,381 --> 01:06:14,507
- Ursula.
- You're right.

858
01:06:14,632 --> 01:06:17,302
- Don't say it.
- I love him. I'm outta here.

859
01:06:17,468 --> 01:06:21,306
Ursula, you can't love him.
Arthur, say something.

860
01:06:21,472 --> 01:06:23,558
- Be careful out there, honey.
- What?

861
01:06:23,725 --> 01:06:26,019
- Goodbye, Daddy.
- I love you.

862
01:06:26,186 --> 01:06:28,646
- Wha...
- I love you, Mom. Thank you.

863
01:06:28,813 --> 01:06:31,816
- Ursula... Arthur, do something!
- What would you have me do?

864
01:06:31,983 --> 01:06:35,236
- There's obviously no stopping her.
- Oh, God.

865
01:06:39,032 --> 01:06:43,703
- Ursula!
- God, that woman's a pain in the ass.

866
01:06:45,955 --> 01:06:48,416
<i>Meanwhile,
halfway across the world...</i>

867
01:06:48,583 --> 01:06:50,710
<i>another ass was feeling pain...</i>

868
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:53,546
<i>as an ape named Ape
was caged in a cage...</i>

869
01:06:53,713 --> 01:06:56,382
<i>hoping to hear
the jungle king's awesome...</i>

870
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:04,140
<i>Hey, I'm pretty good at that...</i>

871
01:07:04,307 --> 01:07:06,267
<i>and wondering
if he would ever come.</i>

872
01:07:06,434 --> 01:07:08,645
<i>But the motion-sick mammal
needn't have moaned...</i>

873
01:07:08,811 --> 01:07:11,648
<i>for that defender of the innocent,
protector of the weak...</i>

874
01:07:11,814 --> 01:07:15,193
<i>and all-around good guy
George of the Jungle...</i>

875
01:07:15,360 --> 01:07:17,820
<i>was closer than he knew.</i>

876
01:07:22,825 --> 01:07:25,537
Next time George get bigger box.

877
01:08:26,931 --> 01:08:29,058
Oh! Bad luck.

878
01:08:32,645 --> 01:08:34,230
- Did you hear something?
- What?

879
01:08:34,397 --> 01:08:36,858
- I heard a noise.
- Shut up and push!

880
01:08:40,195 --> 01:08:42,405
Oh, I think I chipped a tooth.

881
01:08:46,492 --> 01:08:49,954
- Oh, Thor, you're disgusting.
- God, that wasn't me.

882
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:52,332
Not me.

883
01:09:16,564 --> 01:09:19,275
- I'm hungry.
- Oh, shut up.

884
01:09:19,484 --> 01:09:21,986
You've been yakkin' for 2 days straight,
and I'm gettin' mad enough to...

885
01:09:22,153 --> 01:09:24,447
You know, you really should
work on your anger.

886
01:09:24,572 --> 01:09:28,368
Have you tried Brankowski's
"Cage the Rage" technique?

887
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:30,954
Don't let him get to you, Thor.
He's just an ape.

888
01:09:31,162 --> 01:09:33,790
That's a fine way to talk
to your meal ticket.

889
01:09:33,915 --> 01:09:36,584
You keep that up, it's liable
to affect my stage performance.

890
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:39,337
Give him a banana, Thor.
It won't be long now.

891
01:09:39,504 --> 01:09:41,548
That's what you said yesterday.

892
01:09:41,714 --> 01:09:43,716
This trail's taking us
to the middle of nowhere.

893
01:09:43,925 --> 01:09:47,303
The sign at the trail head said
"Short cut to Ape River".

894
01:09:47,470 --> 01:09:50,932
Now, why would it say "short cut"
if it wasn't a...

895
01:09:51,099 --> 01:09:55,770
Wait a minute.
Maybe it's a fake, a decoy trail.

896
01:09:55,937 --> 01:09:59,190
Very good, Max.
Actually, the trail is a fake.

897
01:09:59,357 --> 01:10:04,445
It circles Ape Mountain six times before
heading right back to the tree house.

898
01:10:04,571 --> 01:10:08,658
- Ohh! Oh, I knew we was lost.
- Don't listen to him, Thor.

899
01:10:08,825 --> 01:10:11,870
He's just tryin' to trick us,
lead us off the short cut...

900
01:10:11,911 --> 01:10:14,080
so we take twice as long
on the regular trail.

901
01:10:14,247 --> 01:10:16,666
We're already taking twice as long!

902
01:10:16,749 --> 01:10:19,669
Are you gonna let a monkey
make a monkey out of ya?

903
01:10:20,086 --> 01:10:22,422
- What?
- Duh!

904
01:10:22,755 --> 01:10:27,635
Let's go. If he tells us the short cut
leads to the tree house...

905
01:10:27,635 --> 01:10:30,597
then that's exactly
where it doesn't lead.

906
01:10:40,064 --> 01:10:42,442
Ape?

907
01:11:04,964 --> 01:11:07,717
- Poor ape-napped brother.
- Careful.

908
01:11:09,052 --> 01:11:12,180
Max, look.
We're back at the tree house.

909
01:11:13,556 --> 01:11:17,018
Well, I tried, but you fellas
are just too smart for me.

910
01:11:17,644 --> 01:11:19,187
Oh, no!

911
01:11:19,229 --> 01:11:21,314
<i>"Oh, no" was right, for the
exhausted ape-nappers had...</i>

912
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:25,527
Hey! Why don't you say something constructive
for a change, like what we should do now.

913
01:11:25,693 --> 01:11:29,447
<i>- Because I don't like you.</i>
- Well, I hate you, you snotty son of a...

914
01:11:29,531 --> 01:11:34,077
<i>I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Having some fun now, hmm?</i>

915
01:11:34,285 --> 01:11:37,163
- Thor, were you fighting with the narrator?
- Well, he started it.

916
01:11:37,163 --> 01:11:38,623
<i>- Did not.</i>
- You did too!

917
01:11:38,790 --> 01:11:40,166
<i>- Did not.</i>
- You did too!

918
01:11:40,166 --> 01:11:40,833
<i>Did not!</i>

919
01:11:40,875 --> 01:11:42,418
- You did too!
- Thor, stop it!

920
01:11:42,460 --> 01:11:44,671
That's it. I'm not draggin'
this thing another inch.

921
01:11:44,712 --> 01:11:47,423
What are you doing? Get back there
and work. Where are you going?

922
01:11:47,465 --> 01:11:48,591
You wretched little weasel.

923
01:11:48,716 --> 01:11:51,553
Aren't you the little weasel,
you big brontosaurus?

924
01:11:57,058 --> 01:11:59,644
- Let's take care of him.
- Huh? Huh?

925
01:11:59,811 --> 01:12:03,648
- Whoa!
- Why didn't you come sooner?

926
01:12:03,815 --> 01:12:06,317
Why Ape have little stars
around head?

927
01:12:09,821 --> 01:12:13,491
George, remember everything I taught you
about Queensberry rules and fighting fair?

928
01:12:13,575 --> 01:12:16,327
- Uh-huh.
- Well, now's a good time to forget it.

929
01:12:16,369 --> 01:12:18,496
Let's finish him off.

930
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:26,921
- Oh, I can't breathe, Max.
- Let it out, Thor. Let it out.

931
01:12:33,428 --> 01:12:36,347
Right, jungle boy.

932
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:54,616
- Huh?
- Huh?

933
01:13:27,273 --> 01:13:28,191
Tookie-Tookie!

934
01:13:28,358 --> 01:13:31,110
- Take this!
- Stop it! Ape!

935
01:13:47,835 --> 01:13:51,548
Get it off!
Get it off of me, Max!

936
01:14:08,606 --> 01:14:11,192
All right!

937
01:14:11,401 --> 01:14:13,945
Shep, look out!

938
01:14:16,281 --> 01:14:18,449
Ursula?

939
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:26,749
George good teacher.

940
01:14:29,919 --> 01:14:34,716
George. George.
I came all this way to tell you that...

941
01:14:34,924 --> 01:14:37,969
Ursula talk later.
George busy now.

942
01:14:40,138 --> 01:14:42,182
- What?
- Fella got toucan on can.

943
01:14:42,348 --> 01:14:44,684
I know.

944
01:15:07,582 --> 01:15:11,002
Good show, George.
And you too, Tookie.

945
01:15:11,169 --> 01:15:14,339
Oh, my hero.

946
01:15:14,506 --> 01:15:16,925
Did I just say that?

947
01:15:17,091 --> 01:15:21,471
- George. Over here, George!
- Ape, sit tight. George be right back.

948
01:15:21,596 --> 01:15:23,306
Oh, I say.

949
01:15:31,940 --> 01:15:35,860
Now George can talk.
What Ursula come back to say?

950
01:15:38,404 --> 01:15:42,617
Only that I know in my heart...

951
01:15:42,742 --> 01:15:46,621
that I really, truly...

952
01:15:46,663 --> 01:15:49,624
- ...haven't seen the light yet.
- Lyle.

953
01:15:49,791 --> 01:15:51,793
- Lyle?
<i>- Yes, Lyle.</i>

954
01:15:51,960 --> 01:15:54,921
<i>For the venal van de Groot had escaped
from the Bujumbura jail...</i>

955
01:15:55,088 --> 01:15:58,299
<i>and joined an obscure cult
on the shores of Lake Tanganyika...</i>

956
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:01,177
<i>which had empowered him with
a peculiar piece of parchment.</i>

957
01:16:01,344 --> 01:16:05,098
- What are you doing here?
- Surprised, my little cupcake?

958
01:16:05,265 --> 01:16:07,267
You see, I'm now
an mail-order minister...

959
01:16:07,433 --> 01:16:11,938
ordained the Church of Celestial
Power and Light, Incorporated...

960
01:16:12,105 --> 01:16:16,651
capable of performing legally binding
marriage ceremonies anywhere.

961
01:16:16,818 --> 01:16:19,737
- Lyle, I'm not marrying you.
- Actually, you are.

962
01:16:19,904 --> 01:16:21,781
Come on, let's go. Come along,
my little African queen.

963
01:16:21,823 --> 01:16:22,365
George.

964
01:16:22,490 --> 01:16:26,077
Now George really mad.
George tear off your...

965
01:16:27,579 --> 01:16:31,583
- At ease, jungle boy.
- Everybody freeze now!

966
01:16:31,749 --> 01:16:34,002
Operation completed
as ordered, sir.

967
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:38,798
Thank you, Gunnar, Gunter,
Hans, Jan and Phil.

968
01:16:40,717 --> 01:16:42,635
No hard feelings, stone belly.

969
01:16:42,802 --> 01:16:44,929
The best man won. That's all.

970
01:16:45,096 --> 01:16:48,892
I should say, the guy who brought
mercenaries won. That's all.

971
01:16:49,058 --> 01:16:52,562
Okay, honey, you ready to go? I got
a boat waitin' to take us to Bujumbura.

972
01:16:52,729 --> 01:16:54,355
- Come on.
- George!

973
01:16:54,397 --> 01:16:55,273
- Ursula.
- Come on.

974
01:16:55,315 --> 01:16:56,608
- No!
- Don't go that way!

975
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:59,611
- Go that way. No...
- See you later.

976
01:16:59,777 --> 01:17:04,657
- George! Stop it! Stop it!
- Ursula!

977
01:17:04,824 --> 01:17:08,870
- Lyle, let go of me.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

978
01:17:36,981 --> 01:17:40,652
Bongo-gram! Work every time.

979
01:17:40,818 --> 01:17:44,906
Good work, brother apes.
Now listen very carefully to George.

980
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:58,002
Let 'er rip, Shep.

981
01:18:00,797 --> 01:18:04,634
Stop it! Stop it, Lyle!

982
01:18:04,843 --> 01:18:08,304
- Come on.
- Let go. Stop it! You're such a jerk!

983
01:18:10,765 --> 01:18:14,978
Come on in there! Come here!

984
01:18:15,144 --> 01:18:19,274
You know, I forgive you, and I'm
willing to give you yet another chance.

985
01:18:19,482 --> 01:18:22,944
Lyle, you don't where you're go...

986
01:18:44,757 --> 01:18:49,137
Where's George?

987
01:18:52,599 --> 01:18:55,435
You see? I told you
I'd have a boat waiting.

988
01:19:22,212 --> 01:19:25,673
Okay, then. All righty.

989
01:19:25,882 --> 01:19:28,801
Reverend Lyle
ready to perform the ceremony.

990
01:19:28,968 --> 01:19:32,931
Do you, Ursula Stanhope,
take me, Lyle van de Groot...

991
01:19:33,056 --> 01:19:36,184
- to be your lawful wedded husband?
- Get a grip, Lyle.

992
01:19:44,734 --> 01:19:47,153
- Lyle.
- Yeah, honey?

993
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:50,698
- Lyle?
- Oh, my God!

994
01:20:06,005 --> 01:20:08,508
Lyle!

995
01:20:12,136 --> 01:20:13,304
Tookie-Tookie!

996
01:20:14,597 --> 01:20:17,517
Thanks, Tookie.

997
01:20:18,935 --> 01:20:22,021
This biggest swing
in jungle history...

998
01:20:22,188 --> 01:20:25,608
will hurt very much,
but George have to do it.

999
01:21:02,854 --> 01:21:04,856
- George!
- What the...

1000
01:21:09,235 --> 01:21:14,657
- This gonna hurt.
- George, watch out for that tree!

1001
01:21:18,912 --> 01:21:22,874
George not feel so good.

1002
01:21:38,139 --> 01:21:42,310
Oh, thank God we've made it.
Say "I do", Ursula.

1003
01:21:42,477 --> 01:21:46,523
Ah, that's it. We're married.
Now to look at my bride.

1004
01:21:48,233 --> 01:21:51,861
No!

1005
01:21:56,866 --> 01:21:59,953
No! No!

1006
01:22:01,579 --> 01:22:07,460
George, what I came here to say
was that I love you.

1007
01:22:08,711 --> 01:22:13,299
- Ursula love George?
- So much.

1008
01:22:13,883 --> 01:22:17,178
George love Ursula too.

1009
01:22:17,554 --> 01:22:21,558
<i>And so George of the Jungle received
the first kiss of his life...</i>

1010
01:22:21,766 --> 01:22:24,227

neither elephant nor ape.</i>

1011
01:22:26,271 --> 01:22:28,189
<i>And on the following new moon...</i>

1012
01:22:28,356 --> 01:22:32,235
<i>Ursula Stanhope finally got
the simple wedding she had hoped for...</i>

1013
01:22:32,443 --> 01:22:35,113

and the king of the jungle...</i>

1014
01:22:35,321 --> 01:22:39,242
<i>joined their hearts forever
in wedded bliss.</i>

1015
01:22:42,829 --> 01:22:44,831
- The rings!
- The rings.

1016
01:22:44,998 --> 01:22:47,041
The rings? Tookie.

1017

Tookie.

1018
01:23:11,065 --> 01:23:13,776
Arthur, I wish you'd do something
about all these monkeys.

1019
01:23:13,902 --> 01:23:16,279
I feel like Jane Goodall.
