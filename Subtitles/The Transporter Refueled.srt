00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,041
Hey.

3
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,930
Yo, boy, you can't park there.

4
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,890
- We're doing business here.
- So are we.

5
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,366
Move it!

6
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,090
You, come.

7
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,700
Tell everyone you know from now on

8
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,121
the prostitution on French Riviera
belongs to me.

9
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,601
Who are you?

10
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,886
Karasov.

11
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,401
Go now.

12
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,922
Anna, smile.

13
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,765
Smile!

14
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,925
Good girl.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,700
- You wanna work for me?
- Sure.

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,780
Good, sweetie.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,100
Come on, girls. Get to work.

18
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,649
Try to enjoy it, Anna.

19
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,060
- Anna?
- Yes.

20
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,243
It's me. It's done.
We're all ready for tonight.

21
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,442
- Everything's set up.
- Good.

22
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,400
- Anna?
- Yes.

23
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,683
Are you sure you want to do this?

24
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,248
We can still cancel everything,
you know?

25
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,522
I can't stop until
I get all the way out.

26
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,820
Okay. We'll do as we planned.

27
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,860
I love you.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,086
I love you, too.

29
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,241
Technology moves so fast, doesn't it?

30
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,610
I mean, as soon as you think
they can't come up with something,

31
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,129
they come up with something else.

32
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,002
It'll be able to drive itself soon.

33
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,088
Makes you wonder if guys
like me will be out of it.

34
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,202
But people always need
guys like me, right?

35
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,971
Hand over the keys, boy!

36
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,365
But the keys won't do you any good.

37
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,300
See, this car only starts
with the driver's unique fingerprints

38
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,731
when I grip the wheel.

39
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,041
Shut up!

40
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,891
You're smart and sharp.
I'm gonna cut you up.

41
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,201
Gimme the keys and blow.

42
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,441
Excuse me.

43
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,401
Hey!

44
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,460
Now, here's how we're going to do this.

45
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,130
Put your hands on that wheel, and drive.

46
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,767
That's not a very good plan.

47
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,927
Get in the car!

48
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,687
You're gonna make me late.

49
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,447
And I hate being late.

50
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,889
I told you that wasn't a good plan.

51
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,420
You're late.

52
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,500
I'm 38 seconds late.

53
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,260
There's several degrees of early
and only one degree of late.

54
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,441
And that's too late.

55
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,963
- So?
- So what?

56
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,180
So how'd it go?

57
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,860
I thought you didn't ask questions.

58
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,362
I don't ask questions when
I'm on a job, but this is a favor.

59
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,005
Went okay.

60
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,161
So how much did you get?

61
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,460
791.

62
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,300
791,000?

63
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,940
That sounds like you
did better than okay.

64
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,964
791 euros.
That's my pension from here on.

65
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,049
791 euros a month.

66
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,286
Well...

67
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,363
Happy retirement, Dad.

68
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,900
Thirty-odd years of making good money
and not a moment to spend it.

69
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,500
Now I've got all the time in the world
and not enough money to spend.

70
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,841
If you ask me, the system's broken.

71
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,046
Pâté de canard.

72
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,260
Good enough for you?

73
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:18,646
I'll tell you once I taste it.

74
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,140
Maybe you should think about getting
a car of your own, you know.

75
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,220
I have my own car.

76
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,860
Then maybe you should
think about using it.

77
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,820
I enjoy our quality time together.

78
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,700
You do realize I sit
in traffic for a living.

79
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,926
Is that what you do?

80
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,405
I came here to be closer to you.

81
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,965
And England wasn't close enough?

82
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,491
Your mother's buried there.

83
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,100
The island is like a cemetery to me now.

84
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,660
Easy on the drama, Dad, please.

85
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,922
Just promise me you won't
stick me in the ground. Hmm?

86
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,300
Your mother was a good
Catholic and everything,

87
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,220
but when it comes my time to go,

88
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,129
just throw me on the fire
and feed me to the fish.

89
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,380
You gonna get that, Junior?

90
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,130
I don't use the phone while I'm driving.

91
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,041
It's a hard world to get a break in

92
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,087
All the good things have been taken

93
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,780
But girl there are ways
to make certain things pay

94
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,723
Hi, Gina, it's me.
We're all waiting for you.

95
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,127
Please call me.

96
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,770
She's gonna come. Don't worry.

97
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,645
Can you believe these girls?

98
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,660
This is how they show
their appreciation.

99
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,260
By being late for an appointment.

100
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,646
You don't listen to me.

101
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,447
It's rude. What if I was a client?

102
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,180
She wouldn't be late then.

103
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,300
But to meet me, the man
who puts the money in her pockets

104
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,767
and pays her medical bills, she's late.

105
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,167
I'm sure that's her.

106
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,481
It better be.

107
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,300
- Hi, baby.
- Sorry, sorry.

108
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,420
Everyone was worried.

109
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,490
Yeah, traffic in this town's a nightmare
and my cell phone died.

110
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,368
Well, when I see Karasov tonight,
I will tell him to get you a driver.

111
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:07,769
Now, that we are all here,
let's get this party going.

112
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,210
My sentiments exactly.

113
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,765
Yes!

114
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,129
Okay. Okay.

115
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,820
Who is she?

116
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,340
I don't know. She was independent.

117
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,965
She died of a hero OD.

118
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,929
- You got the necklace?
- Yes. Do your thing.

119
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,041
Okay.

120
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,005
- Qiao, ready?
- Ready.

121
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,730
All for one, one for all.

122
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,641
Let's go.

123
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,325
So, what's your plan?

124
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,566
My plan for what?

125
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,920
For the future, Dad.

126
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,247
You must have a plan.
You always have a plan.

127
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,683
Well, I was gonna keep it
as a surprise, but since you asked,

128
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,928
I've been thinking about buying that.

129
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,420
That's a nice fishing boat for a guy
with a worker's pension.

130
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:44,567
I've been saving for it.

131
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,260
Yeah, I think you miss to travel.

132
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,700
I mean, you've been in some
pretty wild places in your time.

133
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,404
Germany in the '80s,

134
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,420
Colombia in the '90s,
Middle East since then.

135
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,060
Evian is a global brand, and I'm...

136
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,161
Top sales rep.

137
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,300
Yeah.

138
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,980
Yeah, I know. Yeah.

139
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,129
Thirty-odd years working as a rep
for a water company,

140
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,540
and you always seem to find yourself
in the most dangerous places,

141
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,449
the most defining moments.

142
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,326
Fall of the Berlin Wall,
collapse of the Medellin cartel,

143
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,220
- and the Taliban...
- Hmm.

144
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,660
...don't forget the Taliban.

145
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,660
I bet they like Evian in Fallujah.

146
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,660
Well, they don't really care
for sparkling water.

147
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,000
They do prefer the flat.

148
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,685
Okay, Dad.

149
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,140
Junior, I don't think you have
one ounce of wiggle room

150
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,402
to moralize to me about
how I earn my living.

151
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,380
- And what you mean by that?
- Oh, nothing.

152
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,810
I'm sure all your clients are movie
stars, captains of industry, dignitaries.

153
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,486
I don't ask, they don't tell.

154
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,806
That should tell you something.

155
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,729
Oh, look, um, Miss Unknown
is calling again.

156
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,002
And what would make you think
that "Unknown" is a Miss?

157
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,850
I'm just guessing.

158
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,081
Hello?

159
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,250
Is this the Transporter?

160
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,810
That depends who this is.

161
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:53,083
Hopefully, your next employer.

162
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,169
I don't do business over the phone.

163
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,688
Tomorrow then. 2:00 p.m.
at the bar at the Majestic hotel.

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,206
How will I know who you are?

165
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:01,540
I'll be alone.

166
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,900
You know, in my day, when you wanted
to make a cup of coffee

167
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,048
you just had to boil the water
and strain the grinds.

168
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,206
Now it seems like you need a PhD.

169
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,729
Dad, you have a PhD.

170
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,205
That's a juicer.

171
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,849
You need a woman around the house.

172
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,980
...acting like haters

173
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:31,084
Haters acting like...
Just, just acting like haters

174
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,608
Yo, repeat my conversation
I talk just 'bout my haters

175
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,300
'Cause haters love my pictures

176
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,769
So now I'm getting' funky
Stackin' money off these hoes

177
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,962
Haters actin' like...
...actin' like haters

178
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,260
Yo, repeat my conversation
I talk just about my haters

179
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,140
Them haters love my pictures

180
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,940
So now I'm getting' funky
Stackin' money off these hoes

181
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:57,140
Any kind of cash I'm a professional

182
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,403
When it come to ass I'm a professional

183
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,980
When it's getting hot I'm a professional

184
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,220
Murder alien slang extraterrestrial

185
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,446
Bang bang

186
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,967
Leo?

187
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,601
Huh?

188
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,285
Since when we work together?

189
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,805
Twelve years.

190
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,060
Fifteen.

191
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,288
Fifteen years.

192
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,161
You still don't trust me.

193
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,441
I trust you.

194
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,167
But when it comes to girls,
I'd like to take my time.

195
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,081
Take your time.

196
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,700
- And Yuri...
- Hmm?

197
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,768
...is it true that you live
in your plane now?

198
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:38,060
Yeah, no customs, no taxes,
free like a bird, man.

199
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,660
- Hold on. Arkady?
- Not now.

200
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,444
There's been an accident.

201
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,967
Da.

202
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,728
They're calling it
an electrical malfunction.

203
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,340
His wife identified the bodies.

204
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,851
Then what am I doing here?

205
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,260
He was your accountant, was he not?

206
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,780
Mine and a lot of other people's.

207
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,260
Did you ask all of them to come
down here to see his body?

208
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,442
I didn't ask you to come here
to see his body.

209
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,847
I asked you to come here to see hers.

210
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,881
Who is she?

211
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,100
I was hoping you might tell me.

212
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,248
She appears to be one of yours.

213
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:28,940
I'm afraid I don't know
what you're talking about.

214
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,700
The Coeur Brisé is hardly
a secret, Mr. Karasov.

215
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:35,441
Even men in my own department
have spent time with your "hostesses."

216
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,420
That is what you call them, no?

217
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,364
I'm a legitimate businessman, Inspector.

218
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,522
I have a lot of people who work for me.

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,287
And I can't possibly
account for all of them.

220
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,820
Of course not.
Though what I can't quite figure

221
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,380
is why one of them would want
to kill your accountant.

222
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:53,420
I thought you said this was
an electrical accident.

223
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,940
That is what the hotel is saying.

224
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,580
They haven't had the benefit
of seeing the .9mm slugs

225
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,140
we pulled from their heads.

226
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,020
- They were shot?
- At close range.

227
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,220
I suspect whomever did this started
the fire to cover their tracks.

228
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,900
And you think I had
something to do with it.

229
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,809
I want to be perfectly clear.

230
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,300
No one is accusing you of anything.

231
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,686
Good.

232
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:17,362
'Cause if you ever do,
you better come with more men.

233
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,060
You think the West Africans from '95
are trying to get back into the skin game?

234
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,340
- They're too smart for that.
- Who is then?

235
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,380
I don't know. But when I find out
who they are,

236
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,482
they'll wish they were someone else.

237
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,601
You called me.

238
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,371
How did you know it was me?

239
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,851
You said you'd be alone.

240
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,500
Well, she's alone.

241
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,580
Oh, she has a dog with her.

242
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,921
Dog people usually
say they're with their dog.

243
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:57,220
Well, I appreciate you
coming to meet me. I am...

244
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,380
- No names.
- What?

245
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,460
That's the first rule.

246
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,740
Someone asks me who you are,
I have plausible deniability.

247
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,365
Better for me, better for you.

248
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,700
I heard you were like this.

249
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,801
Heard from whom?

250
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:10,500
Someone you worked with previously whose
name would presumably mean nothing

251
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:11,806
given your first rule.

252
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,801
You're a quick study.

253
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,100
Are there any other rules
I need to know about?

254
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,140
Once the deal is made,
the deal never changes.

255
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,401
You change the deal, I drive away.

256
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,180
The deal is for one passenger.

257
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,540
You pick me up, drop me off.

258
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,880
Your whiskey, sir.

259
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,300
- Any packages?
- Two.

260
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,528
- Weight?
- 104 kilos in total.

261
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,100
Is that a problem? I was told
that you can transport anything.

262
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,407
As long as I don't know what it is.
That's the last rule.

263
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,402
Plausible deniability.

264
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,167
When's the pick up?

265
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:52,527
Tonight. 5:00 p.m.
Banque de Monaco in Monte Carlo.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,161
That's in three hours.

267
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,370
You need to take a nap?

268
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,324
5:01 then I'm gone, clear?

269
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,169
Yes.

270
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,900
I gather my previous employer
mentioned my...

271
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,331
Of course. Your fee.

272
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,804
Half now, half upon delivery.

273
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,924
I'm good at following the rules.

274
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,287
Good.

275
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,971
All goes well, perhaps we'll
work together again in the future.

276
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,122
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

277
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,566
It's me. He left. You can proceed.

278
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,740
Oh.

279
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,820
Is there a problem?

280
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,780
No, it's just that
it's a Château Cheval Blanc

281
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,769
from the 2005 vintage.

282
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,740
I know, it says so on the label.

283
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,171
But it's 900 euros.

284
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,081
- Really?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,131
900... 900 euros? Oop!

286
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,740
Perhaps I can point you
toward an excellent,

287
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,660
and more affordable
selection of local vineyards?

288
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,761
I'll be fine.

289
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,486
Frank...

290
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,286
Do you need anything?

291
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,771
No. I'm good, thanks.

292
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,380
Hello, Junior.

293
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,448
Dad, I don't think I'm going
to be able to make dinner tonight.

294
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,180
Couple of things I need to take care of.

295
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,180
I'm sorry to hear that. I got us
a really good bottle of wine.

296
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,340
Yeah, I'm sorry.

297
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,820
I'll just have to find
someone else to share it with.

298
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,285
That sounds like a good plan.

299
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,700
Sounds like a perfect idea.

300
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,926
May I be of some assistance?

301
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,060
Thank you.

302
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,889
- Do you mind holding that?
- Of course.

303
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,210
Expensive taste.

304
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,405
Nice hair.

305
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,170
Always wanted to be a blonde.

306
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,441
Where are the packages?

307
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,365
They're coming.

308
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,886
Ten seconds.

309
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,925
Five.

310
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,961
One.

311
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,563
- Okay, all set.
- What's this?

312
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,340
- What?
- What's going on?

313
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,540
Oh, you're asking questions now?

314
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,980
No. I told you once I set the deal,
the deal doesn't change.

315
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,740
And it hasn't.
Here are my two lovely packages.

316
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,860
Gina, 49 kilos, Qiao, 55 kilos.
104 in all.

317
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,086
We should go.

318
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,220
No, I'm canceling the deal.

319
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,300
You should go.

320
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,640
Out of the car. All of you. Now.

321
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,540
No one is getting out of the car,
asshole. Now drive.

322
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,340
You think this is the first time
someone's held a gun to my head?

323
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,460
No, I don't.

324
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,420
But it's gonna be the first time
someone uses it.

325
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,965
Oh, she's a charmer.

326
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,764
Anna, there's a cop.

327
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,447
Okay, we don't have time
to talk about this anymore.

328
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,500
Just show it to him already.

329
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,681
Show me what?

330
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,123
No good deed goes unpunished.

331
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,405
Don't mess this up.

332
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,725
Monaco Police.
Vehicle documents, please.

333
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,521
Window!

334
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,084
What is it gonna be, Frank?

335
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,721
Lower the window.

336
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,046
Get out of the vehicle!

337
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,687
Seatbelts, now.

338
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,620
Get my father back on the phone.
I want to talk to him now.

339
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,241
You'll be able to talk to him all you
want as soon as the job is done.

340
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,441
Whoo!

341
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,845
This is a good time to lose them, Frank.

342
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,441
I'm doing my best.

343
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,686
So what's with all the getups?

344
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,860
Questions again?

345
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,820
- What about your rules?
- I don't ask names.

346
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,400
But when someone kidnaps
my father, I ask questions.

347
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,620
I guess you're as good
as advertised, Frank.

348
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,721
Thanks.

349
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,080
All units... Code 3

350
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,368
black Audi S8 in the tunnel.

351
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,460
Copy!

352
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,580
Look, you'll be delivered as promised,
but if anything happens to my dad...

353
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,523
Stay focused, honey.
Your father will be fine.

354
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,700
What's that?

355
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,926
More company.

356
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,447
Watch out.

357
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,300
You weren't kidding.

358
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,845
Kidding's not really my thing.

359
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,180
- Okay, let's go.
- What are we doing?

360
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,009
We need to change cars. Come on.

361
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,360
Let's go.

362
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,300
Are we going to leave the car
with all the evidence?

363
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,460
Not really.

364
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,660
It's really quite strange,
to tell you the truth.

365
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,880
The Mediterranean Bank has been
robbed before, but never like this.

366
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,081
Let me show you.

367
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,171
You'll see a woman right there.

368
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,700
She said she was Elena Turgin,
wife of one Stanislav Turgin.

369
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,321
Had a passport and his safety
deposit box's keys to prove as much.

370
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,487
That's not Elena Turgin.

371
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,601
Yes.

372
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,060
And while I didn't know
that at the time,

373
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,049
I refused to allow
her access nonetheless.

374
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,700
As only Mr. Turgin is authorized.

375
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,486
But as you will see, I was coerced.

376
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,300
First girl took my keys.

377
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,210
With both sets, she could open
the security box by herself.

378
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,044
There was nothing
I could do to stop her.

379
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,180
And who was on the security post?

380
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,645
Hmm.

381
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,731
Voila.

382
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,241
They all look exactly the same.
You cannot tell them apart.

383
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,601
There's one more thing.

384
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,490
Getaway driver.

385
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,340
He picked the one girl up,

386
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,540
and then waited for the two others
to arrive moments later.

387
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,620
The police found the car,
what was left of it.

388
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,540
It was set fire to,
but they were already gone.

389
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,051
Of course they were.

390
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,762
Oh. Excuse me.

391
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,531
Yes? I'll be right there.

392
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,685
An inspector from Nice.

393
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,646
If you'll wait for me just a minute,
I'll be right back.

394
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,100
What do you think?

395
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,645
They're either our girls,

396
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,340
or someone who's trying to pass
themselves off as our girls.

397
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,860
I will do an inventory and check
with the competition.

398
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,540
See if there's anyone unaccounted for.

399
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,847
First Turgin at the hotel, and now this?

400
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:53,526
Don't worry.
We will find who and make him pay.

401
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,881
Late again, Junior.

402
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,081
Junior?

403
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,241
You're okay, Dad?

404
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,180
Well, I've been sucker
punched a lot in my time,

405
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,123
but never by a girl.

406
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,081
Stop right there.

407
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,521
How many more of you are there?

408
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:50,780
She's the last one.

409
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,201
She is Estonian. From Tallinn.

410
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,660
I've done some funky shit in my time
down there, I can tell you.

411
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,820
Actually they've got very,
very good vodka.

412
00:29:58,920 --> 00:29:59,967
That's great, Dad.

413
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,042
If I were armed, you'd know it by now.

414
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,771
Your father sure is.

415
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,161
He's clean.

416
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,450
Here's the rest of what we owe you.

417
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,085
Thank you very much.

418
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,020
Now if you'll untie him so we can leave
and never see you again.

419
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,202
I'm afraid I can't do that.

420
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,249
We're not done with you just yet.

421
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:27,162
I'm disappointed. I thought
you were all natural blondes.

422
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,001
What do you want?

423
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,246
I wanna make a new deal.

424
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,891
Thanks, but I think I'll pass.

425
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,331
You haven't heard the terms yet.

426
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,926
This should be good.

427
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,320
They're really very simple.

428
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,604
We're going to pay someone a visit,

429
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,740
and you're going to make sure
that we get there and back

430
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,060
without any more incidents.

431
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,606
I'm not sure I see how much
of a deal that really is for me.

432
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,488
The deal for you is that
your father gets to live.

433
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,000
So you're gonna shoot him?

434
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,020
Then what?
You still have me to contend with.

435
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,406
You think we're stupid, Frank?

436
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,565
That hurts my feelings.

437
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:12,180
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
That touches your skin,

438
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:15,727
it's nearly as toxic as the dose
your father drank in his beer.

439
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,922
Headaches, vomiting, convulsions,

440
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,247
all leading up to an eventual death.

441
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,002
Soup to nuts, it will kill
a man in 12 hours.

442
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,780
I should kill you right now. All of you.

443
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:31,300
You could do that, but you'd be
killing your father along with us.

444
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,300
It will take the lab more than
12 hours to find out what it is.

445
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,420
And you have the antidote?

446
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,568
You play ball, your father gets it.

447
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,260
You don't, he dies.

448
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,220
How do I know you're gonna hold up
your end of the bargain?

449
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,845
Did I ever lie to you?

450
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,327
Besides, you don't have
much of a choice.

451
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,125
I got all the girls that most fit
the description on the video.

452
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,321
They're all here?

453
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,771
All but four.

454
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,971
So one of them is the dead girl
from the hotel.

455
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,740
And the others are our thieves.

456
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,081
What did they get
from the safe deposit box?

457
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:27,131
Some cash, jewelry, documents.

458
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,090
Far as I know, Turgin didn't leave
very much in there.

459
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,567
Still doesn't explain the driver.

460
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,730
You know him, don't you?

461
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,484
We go way back.

462
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,524
- Da.
- Excuse me for disturbing you, sir.

463
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:46,081
But there are police officers
approaching the yacht.

464
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,530
Tell them I'm in a meeting.

465
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,888
Get Imasov and Yuri on the phone.

466
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,860
All in all, it's not
the worst way to go.

467
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,169
I always thought I'd end up being shot.
Left to rot somewhere.

468
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,140
Excuse me, but now we're partners, maybe
you can tell me what this is all about?

469
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,500
You do what we ask,

470
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,980
I think you'll find that the more
you venture, the more you will gain.

471
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,684
Quoting Alexandre Dumas?

472
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,806
Like, what? You're Count D'Artagnan
and they're the Three Musketeers?

473
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,921
You've read it.

474
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,540
In fact, my favorite line is,
"I'm sure you're very nice,

475
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,449
"but you'd be nicer
if you left me alone."

476
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,961
No deal, Junior. Zip me up.

477
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,568
Mmm. Don't look so sad.

478
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,686
In 24 hours, this will all be over.

479
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,011
And once you understand what
we're up to, you might even like it.

480
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,201
Stop right here.

481
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,325
What are we doing here?

482
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,845
Do you wanna play doctor?

483
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,848
How long have you been working
for the Coeur Brisé?

484
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,561
I saw your necklace.

485
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,886
Since I was 12.

486
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,011
I suppose now you understand
how I know your former employer.

487
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,380
Karasov. We didn't exactly
leave things on the best of terms.

488
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,925
I'm surprised he'd recommend me.

489
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,321
He didn't.

490
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,484
But I overheard him
on plenty of occasions

491
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,444
telling other people
that you're the best.

492
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,843
Called the best by one
of the worst on the planet.

493
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,089
I'm not sure how to feel about that.

494
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,580
Hello, who's the anesthesiologist on call?

495
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,205
That would be Dr. Benet.

496
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,766
Right, of course. Can you connect me
with central supply, please?

497
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,420
- Central supply.
- I'm Dr. Smith, calling for Dr. Benet.

498
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,900
We're gonna be operating on a US citizen

499
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,740
and we're running low
on Neroflurax in OR-6.

500
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,921
I'll send someone up.

501
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,361
Yeah, don't bother,
I'm already on my way.

502
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,043
- Dr. Smith?
- That's me.

503
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,325
Neroflurax. You sign here.

504
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,291
- I'll grab it.
- Perfect.

505
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,420
But I also need your stamp right here.

506
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,806
Okay, sure.

507
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,607
Done!

508
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,486
Let's go.

509
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,567
Everything okay?

510
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,404
Another shot of vodka?

511
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:56,807
Sure.

512
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,971
Your accent, what is it? Meridional?

513
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,963
You can tell it's meridional?

514
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,180
Well, you don't get to hear
the Languedoc much these days

515
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,123
except from rural old farts.

516
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,564
They love their Occitan.

517
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,900
My parents are from the Basque Country

518
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,900
- in the Pyrenees.
- The Pyrenees.

519
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,490
I know the Basque country well.

520
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,366
How do you know it?

521
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:23,844
Was a big aerospace industry
tucked in all around there.

522
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:28,286
Warheads, helicopter turbo shafts...

523
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,841
I ran many sorts of parts to all sorts
of places in the Middle East.

524
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,004
Basque people are good people.

525
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,923
I love that poulet basquaise.

526
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,380
You cook?

527
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,500
Sure.

528
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,761
And you?

529
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,041
But of course.

530
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,971
They got the gas. We're up.

531
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,684
They got the gas.

532
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,450
They got the gas. Okay.

533
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,900
Any of you speak English?

534
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,081
No, no, no.

535
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,043
Any of you want
to make a thousand euros?

536
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,321
Yeah. Sure!

537
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,601
Let's go.

538
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,167
Hi.

539
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,960
How about a drink?

540
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,324
How about your room?

541
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:39,851
How the hell did they rob a bank?

542
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,580
They'd have to have his...

543
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,364
He did. They did. Someone did.

544
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,900
I'm calling everyone.

545
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,411
Until I figure out what's going on,

546
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,220
be on the look out
for anything strange. Okay?

547
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,367
Okay.

548
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,123
Call the pilot. Let's get out of here.

549
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,020
We can't take off. It's too late.

550
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,249
I want to be on the wheels up
the minute regulations allow.

551
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,441
Yes, sir.

552
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,046
Please, make yourself comfortable.

553
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,489
No, you make yourself comfortable.

554
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,081
Get undressed.

555
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,321
Seatbelts, please.

556
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,060
Three girls dressed the same to rob
a bank so no one knows who's who.

557
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,540
Are you asking me or telling me?

558
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,020
See, the thing I can't figure out is

559
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,500
why one of you stays behind
and misses out on all the fun.

560
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,204
In The Three Musketeers,
there were really four.

561
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,500
One of us had to stay behind
and look after dear old dad.

562
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,331
No. No, I don't think that's it.

563
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,885
You could have left him
tied up in the boot.

564
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,528
Maybe we're smarter
than the Three Musketeers.

565
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,805
You're not that smart
if you're calling him "old."

566
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,328
Hey, jerk-off! You can't park here!

567
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,522
I'll swap the tanks and we meet
back here, okay?

568
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,923
Come on. Let's do this.

569
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,260
Hey, you! What you think you're doing?

570
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,900
I got you fresh smoke.

571
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,525
But the guy just changed the tanks.

572
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,770
It's expired. There's a warning
right on the label. Look.

573
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,684
He wasn't feeling well.

574
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,925
Can you give me the key?

575
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,241
Hey!

576
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,086
Go!

577
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,486
I get the fingerprints.

578
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,761
I'll keep an eye out.

579
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:31,930
- Okay, help me.
- Okay.

580
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,321
Right there.

581
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,804
- They're all out.
- All right.

582
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,845
Good.

583
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:33,486
Okay, baby, it's coming.

584
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,380
All right, I'm in.

585
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,766
I hope the transfer code works.

586
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:40,601
We're gonna find out.
All right. Let's try.

587
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,246
Here we go.

588
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,241
Okay, hold on.

589
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:15,965
Yes! All good. Come on, let's go!

590
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:17,650
Let's get the hell out of here.

591
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,041
Shit.

592
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,687
Where the hell is he?

593
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:59,540
Yes?

594
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,260
It's not nice to keep ladies
waiting alone in a dark alley.

595
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,011
Whoever those ladies are,
tell them I'm on my way.

596
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,361
All right.

597
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:15,768
Hey, you should have
just given me the key.

598
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:19,610
- Where is he?
- I don't know!

599
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:21,450
Is he drinking tea or what?

600
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,086
What took you so long?

601
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:29,042
There was a couple of babies
I had to put to sleep.

602
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:31,362
Shit! Seems some of
the babies just woke up.

603
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,206
And they look cranky.

604
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,540
Come on, let's go.

605
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,691
Wait for me here.

606
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,400
And don't touch anything.

607
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,087
What?

608
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,287
Where is he going?

609
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,580
- Shit!
- Anna, stop the car!

610
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:05,920
He said don't touch anything.

611
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:08,363
Okay, he's got this. He's got this!

612
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:14,686
- Gina!
- I don't know if I trust this guy, Anna!

613
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,820
Oh, shit.

614
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,570
No, I think we should
hit the brakes now.

615
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,740
No, he said don't touch anything. No!

616
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,046
Anna!

617
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:39,481
Stop the car!

618
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,370
Anna, do it now!

619
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,050
- I can't do it!
- I can try.

620
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:47,780
Hit the brakes! The gate!

621
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:48,961
Hurry up!

622
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,740
- Hold on tight.
- Oh, God.

623
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:00,841
No! No!

624
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,020
Seriously?

625
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,282
We're late.
My dad hates it when I'm late.

626
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,126
What are we waiting for?
It's almost 6:00 a.m.

627
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:18,448
Well, the captain's
on his way, Mr. Yuri.

628
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,642
We'll be off as soon
as regulations permit.

629
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,209
Oh, God.

630
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,680
Good morning, sir!

631
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,006
Good morning, Mr. Yuri.

632
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:37,725
Who are you?

633
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,700
I'm your pilot, Captain Martinet.

634
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,165
Captain Guesdon's replacement.

635
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,246
What the hell is this?

636
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,243
Well, this is embarrassing.
I'd assumed that he told you.

637
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:52,646
Um, he's sick. Food poisoning.
Oysters, I believe he said.

638
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:55,841
Call him up.

639
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,527
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

640
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,806
I'm told you are sick, Guesdon.

641
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,771
Yes, oysters.

642
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,125
The pilot who has come in your stead,
you vouch for him?

643
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,564
Yes, I highly recommend him.

644
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:23,361
He is a decorated pilot.

645
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,780
Okay, well, feel better.

646
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:29,006
Thank you.

647
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,448
I want to be in the air
as soon as possible.

648
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:34,210
We shall do our very best, sir.

649
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,740
This is the captain speaking,
we are cleared for take-off.

650
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,569
Good morning, Air Star 669.

651
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,529
Please wait for take-off clearance.

652
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:09,642
Would you like something
to drink, Mr. Yuri?

653
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,884
Champagne? Orange juice?

654
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:13,526
Ah, well, champagne is good.

655
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,364
Champagne, coming right up.

656
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,488
Leave us. Go away.

657
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,845
Your champagne, Mr. Yuri.

658
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,366
Thank you.

659
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,940
Would you like anything else?

660
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:43,768
Yeah, tell the pilot to get a move on
and then come and keep me company.

661
00:50:44,560 --> 00:50:45,721
Sure.

662
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,700
Electrical board checked,

663
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,247
yaw dampers on and operating.

664
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:57,890
Rudder trimmer checked.

665
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:01,765
Ready when you are, Captain.

666
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:03,291
Proceed to main runway.

667
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:08,460
Good morning,
this is the captain speaking again.

668
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,460
We are third in line for take-off.

669
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,800
Please fasten your seat belts.

670
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:13,380
We should be in the air momentarily.

671
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:14,606
Finally.

672
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,645
What the hell?

673
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,241
Hello?

674
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,860
Hmm.

675
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,043
3-1-0-5.

676
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,486
Yes!

677
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,100
Air Star 669.

678
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,540
Please make your way to the main runway.

679
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,100
And wait to be cleared for take-off.

680
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,340
Thank you, Air Traffic Control.

681
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,860
Oh, hang on. We have an alert.

682
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,900
It's probably just a blown fuse.

683
00:52:23,000 --> 00:52:24,260
Probably just a blown fuse?

684
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,328
It's no wonder you're still
in that bloody chair!

685
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:30,380
Air Star 669 to tower.
We're gonna have to run...

686
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,369
We're good. Let's get off this plane.

687
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,363
Air Star 669 to tower...

688
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,606
Tower to Air Star 669, do you copy?

689
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,450
I repeat, do you copy?

690
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,321
This way!

691
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,531
Tower to Air Star 669,
hold your position!

692
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,123
Mr. Yuri! Everything okay in there?
Mr. Yuri?

693
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,641
Sir!

694
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:16,500
I was talking to your friend Gina.

695
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,140
There's a huge aerospace industry
in the Pays Basque region.

696
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,321
What?

697
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,601
In the Pyrenees.

698
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,300
Don't worry. Never mind!

699
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,686
Call security immediately.

700
00:53:32,600 --> 00:53:33,647
Don't say it.

701
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:34,807
How can you be late?

702
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,486
What kind of Special Forces were you?

703
00:53:36,640 --> 00:53:37,860
Where are you, Dad?

704
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,300
Listen, there's been a complication, son.
We're trapped.

705
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,528
We're in the main
compartment cargo area.

706
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,207
Do you have any idea
how to get us out of here?

707
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:55,851
Are you towards the front wheel?

708
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,324
No, no, it's the main cargo hatch.

709
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:12,922
Stop the plane!
I repeat, stop the plane!

710
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,120
Climb in the back.

711
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,460
I'm gonna need you to count for me.

712
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,980
Okay, I'm going to count to five
and you're going to jump.

713
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,140
What do you mean, jump?

714
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,860
What? No! We can't jump!

715
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:30,961
Junior!

716
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:41,326
- Five!
- Five!

717
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,051
- Four!
- Four!

718
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:46,491
- Three!
- Three!

719
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,485
- Two!
- Two!

720
00:54:50,680 --> 00:54:51,920
- One!
- One!

721
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,011
How bad is it?

722
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,451
It's really bad!

723
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:26,887
Take the scarf and put pressure on it!

724
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,123
It's not working, we need a doctor.

725
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,209
If we don't outrun these guys, we're
gonna need a bloody good lawyer too.

726
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,580
Tower to Air Star 669,
you are going to crash.

727
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,140
Do you copy? 669, do you copy?

728
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,860
I repeat, you are going to crash.

729
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,962
You need to stop the engine right now!

730
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,220
- Wake up!
- If you hear me,

731
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,140
you need to pull the emergency brake!

732
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:52,540
It's the trigger on your right.

733
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,563
- Yeah, yeah, I see it.
- Do it now!

734
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:18,445
- She's convulsing!
- What do we do?

735
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,880
You hold on!

736
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:34,300
- You see the building, Junior?
- I do.

737
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,140
Well, planes tend to move,
buildings tend to stand still.

738
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,208
- That's what I'm counting on.
- No, no, no, no!

739
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,020
I see what you're thinking.

740
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:43,451
- And?
- I hate it!

741
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,527
- Holy...
- What the hell?

742
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,611
The unidentified vehicle
has just entered the main terminal.

743
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:19,801
Come on!

744
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,561
Frank!

745
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,444
Okay, hold on. Yeah, okay.

746
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,160
You gotta help her.

747
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,540
Don't look at me. I did my part.

748
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:23,060
I got you there and back.
Now, give me the antidote.

749
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:24,140
Frank!

750
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,401
She can bleed out for all I care.

751
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,540
Junior!

752
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,420
Once the deal is set,
the deal doesn't change.

753
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,568
The deal was my time for the antidote.

754
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:32,205
There is no antidote!

755
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:34,121
Excuse me?

756
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:36,281
It's just water in the vial.

757
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,489
There's nothing in his beer.
We made it up.

758
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,001
So he's not gonna die?

759
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,566
Not from poison.

760
00:58:46,120 --> 00:58:48,327
Be a dear and get me
some rags and water, would you?

761
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:53,180
Look, the bullet is still in there.

762
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,140
If we don't get it out and the bleeding
doesn't stop she is gonna die.

763
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,020
All right, we've wasted enough time
getting here already.

764
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,724
We all agreed. No doctors.

765
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:02,380
No. No, we can't just let her die.

766
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,660
We knew it would be dangerous.

767
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,444
Okay, no doctors.
Let's help her ourselves.

768
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:06,891
Can you pass me that bottle, would you?

769
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:08,761
Dad, you...

770
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,089
Dad, you can't...

771
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:12,884
Don't worry, son. It's focus for me.

772
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,980
Okay, here's the water.

773
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:20,660
Oh, thanks, love.

774
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:21,807
"Love"?

775
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,249
You know, she's from
Pays Basque. Pyrenees.

776
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:26,180
Dad, that's great, Dad.

777
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:28,362
Can you get something
to raise her leg up, please.

778
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,806
See if you can find some perfume,

779
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:31,660
some tweezers
and if there's any sugar around.

780
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:32,860
Okay.

781
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,007
What do you want me to do with it?

782
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,402
All right. Take the rod off
one of those clothes racks

783
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:40,205
and wrap this around the end.

784
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:41,700
What to do? To do what?

785
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,100
And swab all the corners of the room.

786
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,020
See how many cobwebs
you can get on there.

787
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:47,043
- Cobwebs?
- S'il vous plaît.

788
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:49,081
Here.

789
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,380
You handle a lot of triage
in your time as a sales rep?

790
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:02,180
What can I tell you?
Those boys at Evian, they play rough.

791
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:03,805
You could use the vodka.

792
01:00:03,960 --> 01:00:06,964
Don't be ridiculous, son.
That's a waste of good vodka.

793
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:10,845
Right, now listen.
She may look like she's out cold, right?

794
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,940
But she's gonna feel this.
I need you to hold her down.

795
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,246
- Okay.
- All right.

796
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:18,689
Sorry about this, Maria,
but it is the only way.

797
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:27,371
- You got it?
- It's...

798
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,330
Hurry with the cobwebs!

799
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,165
- All right, thanks.
- Yeah.

800
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,126
What does that do?

801
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,780
The sugar disinfects the wound
and cobwebs coagulate the blood.

802
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,405
It's not exactly the Cleveland Clinic,

803
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:48,420
but it's going to keep her alive
until we get her patched up properly.

804
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,204
Put some pressure on that,
would you, Junior?

805
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,571
You're okay. Shh, you're okay.

806
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:56,320
No one's dying today.

807
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:04,380
Look who's there.

808
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,580
Same girls, different outfits.

809
01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:08,045
How did this happen?

810
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:12,285
One second everything is fine,
the next I wake up on the floor.

811
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,247
It's some kind of
medical grade anesthetic.

812
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,807
They switched the tank
for the fog machine.

813
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,720
One part I can't quite
figure out though is

814
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:24,420
why your girls would rob me.

815
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:25,820
Don't be ridiculous.

816
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,700
Just the same as I heard they robbed
Turgin's safe deposit box.

817
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,962
You can't think
I had anything to do with this.

818
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,366
I'm not sure what to think.

819
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,084
But it appears that someone else
is working with them.

820
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,280
You and he know each other, if I recall.

821
01:01:44,960 --> 01:01:46,121
It's Yuri.

822
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,001
Da.

823
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:50,881
Of course not.

824
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,811
I'll get to the bottom of it.

825
01:01:56,680 --> 01:01:59,809
Yuri got hit as well.
Another Coeur Brisé.

826
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:03,048
Awfully convenient, don't you think?

827
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:06,380
Two of us get robbed by your girls
and a friend from your illustrious past.

828
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:09,927
Give me six hours. I'll find them
and I'll take care of it.

829
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:11,321
Let's go.

830
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:44,281
Are they broken?

831
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:46,045
They've been worse.

832
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:47,726
Let me see.

833
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:49,447
I'll be okay.

834
01:02:55,080 --> 01:02:56,525
What about your dad?

835
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,564
Looks like they made it up to him.

836
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,684
I can't remember
the last time either of them

837
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:06,371
slept in the same bed
as the men who pay them.

838
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:08,246
I don't think he paid.

839
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:10,761
Well...

840
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,846
Something else?

841
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,041
Yes.

842
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,167
I wanted to thank you
for what you've done for us.

843
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,042
I'm sorry I lied to you
about the poison.

844
01:03:27,560 --> 01:03:30,643
How about being sorry you kidnapped
my father in the first place?

845
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,489
I'm sorry about that, too.

846
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:39,003
It was wrong for me to use your father,
and it was wrong for me to use you.

847
01:03:39,120 --> 01:03:40,360
Very wrong.

848
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:42,485
I think our deal is done.

849
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:44,926
Yeah.

850
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,285
Don't you want to know
what I'm going to do next?

851
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:56,409
I think I have a good idea.

852
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:01,484
I'm talking about the future.

853
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,161
Tell me about the future.

854
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,884
I'm going to finish what we started.

855
01:04:27,440 --> 01:04:29,283
How did you get
caught up in all of this?

856
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,482
I come from an impoverished village.

857
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:37,170
Drinking and drugs killed
the people that guns didn't.

858
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:42,100
And then when I was 12,

859
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:44,965
I came home from the factory
where I worked

860
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,921
and my mother introduced me
to a man in a very nice suit.

861
01:04:53,960 --> 01:04:55,450
Karasov.

862
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,724
He said I could come and do work
for him in warm places.

863
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:05,049
He would give me food and clothes

864
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,083
and introduce me with men for money.

865
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,207
I looked at my mom
and she said it was okay.

866
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:16,001
"Yeah, go."

867
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:19,610
And so I did.

868
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,689
It wasn't until later that I found out
that she sold me to him.

869
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:31,290
For $500.

870
01:05:34,120 --> 01:05:35,406
Jesus, Anna.

871
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,842
I think she could
have gotten $600, right?

872
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,368
You don't need to do this, you know.

873
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:45,611
You can still walk away.

874
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:50,891
If we stop now, it will have
been for nothing,

875
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,370
everything I went through.

876
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:59,605
Do you know what it feels like
to be thought of as trash?

877
01:06:05,360 --> 01:06:06,930
He'll kill you, you know.

878
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,611
Without thinking about it.

879
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:18,620
It's like the Count
said to his Musketeers,

880
01:06:18,720 --> 01:06:21,690
"I don't cling to life
sufficiently to fear death."

881
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,369
Dad. Time to go.

882
01:07:23,080 --> 01:07:24,081
Really?

883
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:28,521
- Excuse me, ladies.
- Mmm. Mmm.

884
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,606
'Cause I'm a fool for you

885
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:39,363
You know I speak the truth

886
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:44,165
Whatever you say or do

887
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,406
You know they're doing another job.

888
01:07:48,560 --> 01:07:51,723
Yeah, taking on a Russian crime lord
is more of a suicide mission.

889
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,247
Imagine how horrible your life
has to be to try something like that.

890
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:58,300
I've seen some horrible things
in some horrible places.

891
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:01,404
Being sold into prostitution
with death as your only out.

892
01:08:02,080 --> 01:08:03,923
That's about as bad as it gets.

893
01:08:05,280 --> 01:08:08,140
The question is, what are you
gonna do about it?

894
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:09,220
Me?

895
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:10,924
There's no one else in the car.

896
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:13,524
I don't have to do anything.

897
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:16,700
I'm gonna drop you home,
ditch the car at a chopper,

898
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,644
go to Paris for a bit until things
cool down, you know.

899
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,690
That doesn't sound
like the man I raised.

900
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,450
Dad, stop.

901
01:08:23,560 --> 01:08:25,005
All right, stay within the lines,

902
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:28,140
watch everything play out,
that's exactly what a fobbit would do.

903
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:31,420
Look, my entire life, I've tried
to do the right thing, you know.

904
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:34,609
Maybe I wasn't a spy like you,
but I served that fool.

905
01:08:34,920 --> 01:08:36,300
What did it get me?

906
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:39,529
Shit I didn't deserve.
You said it yourself.

907
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:46,969
It doesn't mean you stop
doing the right thing.

908
01:09:08,480 --> 01:09:10,482
Send me a postcard from Paris.

909
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:41,880
- Dad?
- Hello, Frank.

910
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:45,980
Don't tell me you don't recognize my voice.
It hasn't been that long.

911
01:09:46,080 --> 01:09:47,161
What do you want?

912
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,009
Well, I want to make a deal.

913
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,700
You have some people I want,
three of them to be exact,

914
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,140
and I have someone you want.
Go ahead, say hello.

915
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:56,300
Drive away. Wherever you are,

916
01:09:56,400 --> 01:09:58,050
just drive away...

917
01:09:58,520 --> 01:10:01,364
Dad... Put him back on the phone.

918
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,740
Well, he's resting now and frankly,
I think he's giving you bad advice.

919
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:07,220
Anything happens to him...

920
01:10:07,320 --> 01:10:10,180
You'll what? Kill me?
Come on, Frank. I know you.

921
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:11,660
You were a good soldier.

922
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:13,660
And you'll do what
a good soldier always does.

923
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:16,969
You'll follow the orders.
So listen to me very closely.

924
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:21,020
If you ever wish to see your father alive
again, you'll do exactly what I say.

925
01:10:25,840 --> 01:10:27,205
Son of a bitch!

926
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,011
- A big, black SUV.
- Occupants?

927
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:01,660
Couldn't stay away?

928
01:11:01,760 --> 01:11:02,780
There's a new deal.

929
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,860
I thought you said you never...

930
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,530
That was before he took my dad.

931
01:11:05,640 --> 01:11:08,405
Listen, I'm in this shit because
of you and so is my dad.

932
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,740
So whether you agree or not
we're going to see Karasov

933
01:11:10,840 --> 01:11:13,002
on his yacht right now with the ledger.

934
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:15,248
I was all for you,
now I need you to do one for me.

935
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:16,846
Do we have a choice?

936
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:18,200
Not really.

937
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,081
We'll help you.

938
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:23,567
No more games. No more bullshit.

939
01:11:26,480 --> 01:11:27,527
Where's Gina?

940
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,260
She left. Back to her family.

941
01:11:30,360 --> 01:11:31,340
Don't lie to me.

942
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,260
Karasov assumes
that there is only three of us

943
01:11:33,360 --> 01:11:35,601
and that's what he is looking for.
Don't you think?

944
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:37,405
This is why we always
kept someone separate.

945
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:40,729
So one of us could get away.
That was our deal.

946
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,491
Let's get your father back.

947
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,365
Welcome back, girls.

948
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:16,966
Been a long time.

949
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,605
Not long enough.

950
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:21,569
Still upset about what happened?

951
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:23,361
A little bit, yeah.

952
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:26,660
I thought you John Wayne types
just let it roll off your back.

953
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,091
That was the old days.

954
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:30,130
Now we hold grudges and get revenge.

955
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:34,260
Revenge for what?

956
01:13:34,360 --> 01:13:37,900
That car of yours is a real step up
from driving a military convoy truck.

957
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,780
You know, you brought this
on yourself, Frank.

958
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:42,740
Everyone in your platoon played ball,
they made a lot of money.

959
01:13:42,840 --> 01:13:45,860
It would have been easier if you just
went along with the rest, you know.

960
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:49,601
I wasn't there to make money.
I was there to fight a war.

961
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,048
I don't play ball with people like you.

962
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:53,820
Well, I can't speak to the arrangements

963
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:56,287
your country's military
makes to get jobs done.

964
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,563
I'm just happy I was on the side
that profited from it.

965
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:03,484
Well, let's just hope you get
what's coming to you.

966
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:14,969
Qiao, Anna, Maria,
glad you could join us.

967
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:18,700
Where's my dad?

968
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,006
Did one of you bring the ledger?

969
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,889
Now where's my dad?

970
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:33,450
- I said...
- I heard you.

971
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,284
I assume you have a plan, Junior.

972
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:02,700
What is this?

973
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:03,801
You tell us.

974
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:05,660
What's that supposed to mean?

975
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:06,700
You called the meeting.

976
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:08,060
I didn't call anything.

977
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:09,650
Cut this shit. What's this about?

978
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:11,780
Well, for one, I found the people
who stole from you.

979
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,700
Right. And he's right there.

980
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:16,380
Listen, I'm getting pretty sick
of you both accusing me

981
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:17,500
of something I didn't do.

982
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,500
As a matter of fact, I brought
these people here to kill them.

983
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:20,601
He's lying.

984
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,500
Who the hell are you?

985
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,125
I'm Anna and I work for him.

986
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:26,086
He told me to rob you and I did.

987
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:27,811
We called you here
because he has your money.

988
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:32,761
Let her talk.

989
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:39,140
There's no way we're taking
the fall for this.

990
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,260
'Cause he robbed you. Not us.

991
01:15:40,360 --> 01:15:42,060
You lying bitch.

992
01:15:42,160 --> 01:15:44,481
Have him show you. Ask him
to show you the bank account.

993
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:47,044
I'm not showing anybody shit.

994
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:49,083
We've been friends for a long time.

995
01:15:50,240 --> 01:15:51,480
Maybe you should.

996
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,380
You'll see he has every penny.

997
01:15:59,480 --> 01:16:00,460
Shut up!

998
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,881
It's not part of your plan,
this, is it, Junior?

999
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:18,881
I checked the account this morning.
I have just over 120 million.

1000
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,890
I'm gonna lower my gun.
Grab that tablet right there.

1001
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:27,620
Show you the account.
You're gonna see for yourself.

1002
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:28,767
That's a fair start.

1003
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,684
Come on, baby. Come on.

1004
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:43,761
Yeah!

1005
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:56,121
Okay.

1006
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:01,001
Yes!

1007
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,689
Thanks for the code, asshole!

1008
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,207
Okay!

1009
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,204
$120 million. Just as I said.

1010
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:17,001
Give it to me.

1011
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:20,166
This doesn't make sense.

1012
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,771
Don't have the money, huh?

1013
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:29,647
What the hell did you do?

1014
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,245
Exactly what you told me.

1015
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,726
I'm gonna rip you up.

1016
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:38,820
No!

1017
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,490
Maria!

1018
01:17:48,920 --> 01:17:49,967
Shit!

1019
01:18:06,200 --> 01:18:07,486
Come on.

1020
01:18:08,240 --> 01:18:09,730
Say goodbye to your money.

1021
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,380
You think you can untie the boat
and get it started?

1022
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,481
I'll try!

1023
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,801
What?

1024
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:35,260
What's the plan, Junior?

1025
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,361
I'll hold them off.

1026
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:38,323
We meet back on the boat in two minutes!

1027
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:45,603
- Can you give me four?
- Okay.

1028
01:18:47,720 --> 01:18:48,846
Cover fire!

1029
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,860
Oh, you got to be kidding.
Why do you never carry a gun?

1030
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,500
You ever think about
being less critical?

1031
01:18:53,600 --> 01:18:54,601
Come on, come on, let's go!

1032
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:01,527
Okay. On my count!
Three, two, one! Go! Go! Go!

1033
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:16,521
Okay.

1034
01:19:27,760 --> 01:19:28,761
Shit.

1035
01:20:13,680 --> 01:20:15,205
You jerk!

1036
01:20:16,840 --> 01:20:18,251
Dammit!

1037
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:35,047
Gina! No, no, no, no, no.

1038
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:37,726
Stay with me!

1039
01:20:39,160 --> 01:20:41,811
It's okay. It's okay.

1040
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:51,447
Stay with me, stay with me.
Stay with me, stay with me.

1041
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:53,660
I'm sorry, Frank.

1042
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,886
No, no, no.

1043
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,249
- I'm sorry.
- Stay with me.

1044
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,530
Faster! Go here!

1045
01:21:11,880 --> 01:21:13,609
- Get on the jet ski!
- Yes, sir.

1046
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:14,960
Hold on!

1047
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:18,601
Come on!

1048
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,561
Don't move!

1049
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,041
Frank!

1050
01:21:30,720 --> 01:21:31,767
Frank!

1051
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,361
Come on!

1052
01:22:58,240 --> 01:23:01,084
You should have joined me
when you had the chance, Frank.

1053
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,007
Don't move!

1054
01:24:48,080 --> 01:24:49,525
You set this up.

1055
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,740
You called the meeting on the yacht
and made sure my dad was kidnapped,

1056
01:24:52,840 --> 01:24:54,330
so I'd be here
to help you finish the job.

1057
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,006
Stay where you are!

1058
01:24:57,240 --> 01:24:59,780
And now you're going to shoot me
because I'm a loose end.

1059
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:02,201
The last person left
to name you for your crimes.

1060
01:25:02,880 --> 01:25:05,201
I can't stop until I
get all the way out.

1061
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:08,886
The question is, if you were
supposed to kill me then,

1062
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,171
why did you save my life?

1063
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:14,808
Stop.

1064
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,164
Please stop.

1065
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:26,884
Your friends died for you, Anna.

1066
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:29,370
Like I would have died for them.

1067
01:25:34,040 --> 01:25:36,566
I just hope whatever
you got out of it was worth it.

1068
01:25:58,120 --> 01:25:59,565
I'm so sorry.

1069
01:26:03,800 --> 01:26:05,165
You'd better go.

1070
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,966
That's the deal?

1071
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:13,810
That's the deal.

1072
01:27:00,680 --> 01:27:02,860
I'll tell you again,
but it won't be any different.

1073
01:27:02,960 --> 01:27:05,042
I work for Evian.
I was delivering water.

1074
01:27:05,440 --> 01:27:07,124
I get there, there are
dead bodies everywhere.

1075
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,171
Then two guys roar off
on a speedboat and a jet ski.

1076
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:14,780
This one?

1077
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:16,180
On the boat, yeah.

1078
01:27:16,280 --> 01:27:17,740
- And the jet ski?
- I don't know!

1079
01:27:17,840 --> 01:27:20,140
Because whoever he was,
he will be tried for murder.

1080
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,180
Look, I can't tell you what I don't know.
I didn't see the guy.

1081
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,366
How convenient.

1082
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,060
I guess we're done here, right?

1083
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:32,060
'Cause if not, then please
charge me with something,

1084
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,844
otherwise you're wasting both our times.

1085
01:27:35,520 --> 01:27:36,660
You can go.

1086
01:27:37,840 --> 01:27:39,251
Thank you, Inspector.

1087
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,010
Very good of you.

1088
01:27:41,240 --> 01:27:42,241
Goodbye.

1089
01:27:49,880 --> 01:27:51,211
Crime Czar Murdered?

1090
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,580
Twelve hours in a police station.

1091
01:28:05,680 --> 01:28:08,140
Do you know how humiliating
that is for me?

1092
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:10,561
Why don't you tell me all about it
over a good bottle of wine?

1093
01:28:10,880 --> 01:28:12,564
Finally you say something smart.

1094
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:18,321
Maybe we should,
maybe we should knock on heaven's door

1095
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:22,620
We don't need to go to the liquor store

1096
01:28:22,720 --> 01:28:25,380
- You give me that high
- Get me high

1097
01:28:25,480 --> 01:28:28,220
- It's better than gold
- It's better than gold

1098
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,700
- You're making it hard
- You're making it hard

1099
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:33,420
- For me to go slow
- For me to go slow

1100
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:36,060
You give me that high

1101
01:28:36,160 --> 01:28:38,700
It's better than gold

1102
01:28:38,800 --> 01:28:42,964
You're making it hard

1103
01:28:45,240 --> 01:28:47,980
Please, don't you act so ruthlessly

1104
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:52,780
Oh, we're fanatical rabid animals

1105
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,100
Please, no one needs your point of view

1106
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:00,700
No, we're fanatical rabid animals

1107
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:03,980
Please, don't you act so ruthlessly

1108
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:08,369
Oh, we are cannibals rabid animals

1109
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:12,180
Please, no one needs your point of view

1110
01:29:12,280 --> 01:29:16,171
Oh, rabid animals rabid animals

1111
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:18,442
Rabid animals

1112
01:29:19,720 --> 01:29:25,020
Oh, good Lord, life is bitter and sweet

1113
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:29,409
Sometimes on my knees
Sometimes on my feet

1114
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,420
- You give me that high
- Get me high

1115
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,820
- It's better than gold
- It's better than gold

1116
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:50,900
You're making it hard

1117
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:52,260
Mama!

1118
01:29:52,360 --> 01:29:55,340
- For me to go slow
- For me to go slow

1119
01:29:55,440 --> 01:29:58,011
You give me that high

1120
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,700
It's better than gold

1121
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,488
You're making it hard

1122

Red lipstick on your pillowcase

1133
