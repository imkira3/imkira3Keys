Look at them go! Into the final lap.

3
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,479
And here comes number seven...

4
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,470
Dusty Crophopper!

5
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,079
And Dusty wins the gold!

6
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:12,706
Go, Duster!

7
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,839
Dusty, you were just a
small-town crop duster

8
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,519
who overcame impossible odds

9
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,559
to win the Wings Around
the Globe Rally.

10
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,679
And now, you're an air racing legend.

11
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,839
Well, Brent, I've had an amazing team
supporting me every step of the way.

12
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,479
The best coach, the best mechanic...

13
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,519
and the best fuel truck
that anyone could ask for.

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,679
Hey, wait a minute.
You're a gas consultant.

15
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,865
That's correct. I've got gas.

16
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,263
(CROWD CHEERING)

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,740
(CHUCKLES)

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,119
(CHUCKLES) Awesome pic, Dust,
except your eyes are closed.

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:24,439
Racing with your eyes closed,
huh? So, that's your secret.

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,879
Oh, yeah, you figured it out, Chug.

21
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,519
That was some pretty
fancy flying, Dusty.

22
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,068
Saw it all on my radio with pictures.

23
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,199
Um, you mean your TV.

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,559
No, no. That's clearing up.

25
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,879
My bumper was nearly
corroded right through.

26
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,159
- All right.
- Disgusting looking.

27
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,399
Ah, yeah, it was all
rusty and blistered.

28
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,159
I got it. Anyway,
what else is going on?

29
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,559
Dottie gave me some of that Rust-eze
Medicated Bumper Ointment.

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,239
- (SNEEZES)
- Ah!

31
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,079
- How's it look now?
- Looks great. Fine.

32
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,239
- Take a closer look.
- That's close enough.

33
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,799
- Oh.
- What was that?

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,599
Didn't need to see that.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,399

They mentioned the Corn Festival?

Oh, it's national news!

off the hook here at the motel.

the inflatable hangars.

Oh, yeah, everybody
wants to see you, Dusty.

It's gonna be the
biggest Corn Fest yet.

- Absolutely, Skipper.

00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,639
- Don't stay out too late.
- Later, Dust.

this is Jolly Wrench Seven.

- I feel great now, but...

00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:34,439
I got a love-hate relationship
with you, Dusty.

78
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,439
Love that you're my best customer,
hate what you're doing to yourself.

79
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,799
Come on, Dot. You saw me
at the Red Bulldozer race.

80
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,119
I kicked Aston Martin out there!

81
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,439
You're not even listening
to what I'm saying.

82
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,839
And hey, Speed City Airfest
is just a few weeks away.

83
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,519
And I think, if I get a little
more speed coming out of my turns,

84
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,359
really work that radial-G,
I can definitely improve my time.

85
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,679
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

86
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,879
I'm feeling good about my next race.

87
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,839
Well, no damage to the
casing or compressor blades.

- But there is...
- Dusty! Dusty!

What happened? Are you okay, Dust?

91
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,319
It's okay.

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,319
Was it your fuel?
I tested it this morning.

93
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,919
I always take a little sip.
Gets me going.

94
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,119
It's okay. I got quite
a little scare there.

95
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,479
- But Dottie here...
- Dusty!

96
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,479
And it's all good news,
gave me the all-clear.

97
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:15,142
Your reduction gearbox is failing.

98
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,359
My gearbox?

00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,079
Your chip detector had a cluster
of steel shavings on it.

100
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,079
Flakes from the gears.
That's what caused the trouble.

101
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,279
Well, you could just replace it.

102
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,599
Order a new one from A-G Parts.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,909
It'll be here by the end of the week.

What?

106
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,639
Your gearbox... It's...

107
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,346
(SIGHS)

108
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,945
It's out of production.
Long since discontinued.

109
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:47,101
Can't even remember
the last time I saw one.

110
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,359
But, Dottie...

111
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,679
Come on, can't you just
build Dust a new one?

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,119
No. It's too complex.
It has to be factory.

113
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
Well, I mean, there has...

114
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,119
From now on, you have
to back off the torque.

115
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,639
Keep it under 80 percent.

116
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,239
What? 80 percent?

117
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,359
Dottie, you've got me
cranked up to 140.

118
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,959
I need that to race.

119
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,159
If you push yourself into the red,

120
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,999
- your gearbox will fail.
- No, Dottie!

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,359
And then your engine will seize.

122
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,399
- Maybe the test that you did was wrong!
- Dusty, listen!

123
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,479
But I've got a race coming up!

124
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,186
You'll crash!

125
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,319
You push yourself into
the red, you'll crash.

126
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,519
Look, I'm gonna install a
warning light on your panel.

127
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,639
A warning light?

128
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,359
If it comes on,
you'll need to pull power.

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,599
Slow down.

130
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,239
But, Dottie...

131
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,424
You're saying...

132
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,742
I can't race anymore.

133
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,830
I'm so sorry.

134
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,359

138
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,159
I didn't even hear him coming.

139
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,239
And there I saw a wide-body jet

140
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,759

- Pickup trucks.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,199
Dottie's an excellent mechanic.

149
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,039
You know as well as I,
she wouldn't have said

150
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,839
what she said unless she was sure.

151
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,599
- Hey, Dusty! Dusty!
- Hey, Dusty!

152
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,079
- Dusty, hey!
- There he is.

153
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,839
Dust, listen, we just got off the
radio with Ethan up in Grand Flaps.

Twenty-one of them,
and he's gonna check his inventory,

161
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,359
and he's gonna put the
word out for you, Duster.

162
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,599
- It's a good start, right?
- SPARKY: Oh, yeah!

163
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,799
It's a great start!
Can you believe it?

164
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:00,799
Because if that gearbox is out there,
we're gonna find it for you, buddy.

165
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,959
LEADBOTTOM: And, hey,
if you don't, it's all right.

166
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,039
- Because the answer is "Yes."
- "Yes?"

167
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,119
- What?
- Yes?

168
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,199
Huh?

169
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,119
Yes, of course you can
have your old job back.

170
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,599
Don't even have to bother asking.
That's just the kind of guy I am.

171
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,599
SKIPPER: Leadbottom, I'm sure
Dusty appreciates your offer...

172
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,399
Of course, you got to start
back at minimum wage,

173
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,679
and you lost all your vacation time,
gotta go through orientation again.

174
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,799
SKIPPER: Leadbottom, please!

175
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,639
Once you acquire the
taste for Vitaminamulch,

176
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,959
you can't live without it.

177
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,384
It's like Mama's
jalapeno chili. Spicy.

178
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,479
Twice!

179
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,959
It's just that now is
not the best time.

180
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,319
LEADBOTTOM: Come on, Skipper.

181
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,559
I can get his old sprayer
back from that Germany place.

182
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,461
Have it cleaned up and bolted
back on him in no time.

183
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,079
I'll tell you what,
let me buy you a can of oil.

185
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,479
Dusty is the best
duster I've ever known.

186
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,279
And I'm telling you that Dusty
don't crop dust no more.

187
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,359
That's right, no more!

188
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,639
- He's a racer.
- A racer!

189
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,719
He's gonna be back
to racing in no time.

190
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,799
In no time!

191
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,559
- Right, Dusty?
- Right, Dust?

192
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,061
Dust?

00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,750
I didn't have time to look
at a clock. (CHUCKLES)

Is that guy writing

- Yes.
- MAYDAY: Well, I...

- So he just wrote that down?
- Yes.

- And that?
- Yes.

00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,181
Oh.

239
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,759
Can you provide me with
your self-inspection records

240
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,919
and emergency procedure plans?

241
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,239
Oh, look, now, we don't have
many emergencies around here.

242
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,759
Besides, we did get the fire out.

243
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,559
Is that your contingency
plan, Mr. Mayday?

244
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,239
Every time there's an incident,
you topple a water tower?

DUSTY: This was my fault.

Hmm?

247
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,239
I clipped the tower.

- It was an accident.
- (CLEARS THROAT)

252
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,239
It's clear this airport has

00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,239
and equipment from last century.

So, unless Mr. Mayday
gets refurbished,

255
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,759
and acquires a second

in accordance with CFR

chapter one, section 139,

258
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,079
I am pulling this airport's

Oh, Chevy.

261
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,999
Propwash Junction just got shut down?

262
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,759
With no active runway,
how can anybody land?

263
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,919
They can't. That's the problem.

264
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,919
There goes the Corn Festival.

265
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,919
But I already finished
my corncob costume.

266
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,639
Now, everybody, calm down.

267
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,839
- BRODI: Calm down?
- SKIPPER: Calm down.

268
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,479
Calm down? Motel's booked.

269
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,279
This Corn Festival is
what butters my corn.

270
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,519
Brodi, we've already
figured this out.

271
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,465
Dottie, show them.

272
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,799
This is Mayday now.

273
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,959
I did the drawings.

274
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:34,799
We add a new 400-watt siren,
a 2,000 GPM roof turret,

275
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,719
a high-capacity water tank with
integrated class A foam cell,

276
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,799
and we'll have an all-new Mayday.

277
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,959
Get out! He gets rocket boosters?

278
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,879
That's right. Fuelled by good old
hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide.

279
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,719
Of course, remember,
that stuff is highly explosive,

280
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,959
so you'll want to keep it
away from any open flames.

281
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,879
But he's a fire truck.

282
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,399
Exactly. Go on, Dottie.

283
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,639
So, for Mayday to keep his job
and get Propwash reopened,

284
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,479
we just need to find
a second firefighter.

It's fire season.

we might as well hire two.

297
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:51,386
You know, I wish there was
something I could do.

Oh, there's nothing. It's all right.

of firefight left in you.

317
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,799
I got to witness one of the

- Nowadays known as a "SEAT."

319
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,759
DUSTY: A "SEAT"?

320
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,519
MAYDAY:
Yeah. A "Single Engine Air Tanker."

321
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,599
DUSTY: Huh.

322
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,068
MAYDAY:
You see, instead of dusting crops,

323
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,679
you know, like you used to do,

324
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,799
they drop water.

325
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,541
- Wow.
- Yeah.

326
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,599
Uh,

327
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,119
Mayday?

328
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,621
Mmm-hmm?

329
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,864
What if I became our
second firefighter?

330
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,279
You?

331
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,239
Yeah. Dottie will fix you up,

332
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,151
and I'll get certified.

333
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,999
What about your racing?

334
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,039
Look. Right now, we need
to get Propwash reopened.

335
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,780
Me...

336
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,785
And you.

337
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,621
I don't know what to say.

338
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,145
Thanks, Dusty.

lil' jon-jon, and five.

340
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,799
Okay, that's it.
That's the morning rush.

341
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,879
Highway's all clear, Duster.

342
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,879
Now, when you get to
Piston Peak Air Attack,

343
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,839
you're gonna ask for Blade Ranger.

344
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,999
Blade Ranger.

345
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,159
You got it. Yeah.

346
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,639
He's their Chief of Fire and Rescue.

347
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,159
He's an old friend of mine.

348
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,159
He can train and certify you.

349
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,879
Consider it done, Mayday.

350
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,719
And, Dusty, be careful.

351
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,506
I will.

352
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,199
Good luck, Dusty!

353
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,919
Take it easy out there!

354
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,519

355
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,159
CHUG: We're proud of you, pal!

356
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,947
Good luck!

There's a time

358
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,185
In your life

359
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,627

360

ls on your side

361
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,959
You might not feel it

362
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,919
You might not see it

363
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,959
But it surrounds you like a light

364
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:50,079

of tires did you pack?

00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,639
as a natural barrier
to create a firebreak.

484
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,959
All right, jumpers,
let's anchor into the bed

485
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,781
and start building a line.

486
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,991
Awesome!

487
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,239
Who the...

488
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,119
Get out of this air space!

489
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,270
Oh, sorry. Sorry!

490
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,500
(COUGHING)

491
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,941
Oh-oh.

492
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,030
(LAUGHS)

493
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,759
Ah. That ought to do it.

494
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,679
Well, back to work.

495
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,319
I gotta mix up a fresh
batch of retardant.

496
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,439
Once you dry out,
you can wing it on back

497
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,439
to the lodge with the
rest of the tourists.

498
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,159
I'm not a tourist. Actually,
I'm the guy that May...

499
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,389
He's the trainee.

500
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,839
You're the SEAT Mayday radioed about?

501
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,359
- Oh, for the love of...
- Come on, Blade.

502
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,479
He's not just some SEAT.

503
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,559
No, no, no.

504
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,359
Seriously. It's Dusty Crophopper,

505
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,039
the champion air racer.

506
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,679
- "Champion."
- DIPPER: Don't be shy. Come on!

507
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,799
Tell him!

508
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:14,879
No big deal.

509
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,959
He raced all the way
around the world!

510
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,319
(CHUCKLES)

511
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,061
I did. I did do that.

512
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,870
The world wasn't on
fire though, was it?

513
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,225
Was the whole world on fire?

514
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,901
No.

515
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,239
Hmm.

516
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,559
Maru!

517
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,639
What?

518
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,999
Rip off his landing gear.

519
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,079
Wait, what?

520
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,991
(CHUCKLES)

521
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,599
MARU: (SINGING)
Muskrat, muskrat candlelight

522
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,199
It feels pretty weird
without the tip tanks.

523
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,519
Tip tanks? (SCOFFS)

524
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,239
You couldn't exactly
go flying into fire

525
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,759
with fuel tanks on your wings.

526
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,439
Kaboom!

527
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,519
Nope. You're gonna
need these pontoons.

528
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,879
- They may be old...
- Old?

529
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,599
But they'll let you scoop
water right off the lake.

530
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,359
You're goofing on me.
Do you have any new ones?

531
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,100
New? (LAUGHS)

532
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,719
We don't even know what that
word means around here.

533
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:15,199
I rebuilt these babies myself.

534
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,439
They're better than new.

535
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,959
- Give them a go.
- Huh?

536
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,799
All right. Let me just get this...

537
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,381
(MUTTERING)

538
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,879
Pop the wheels, genius.

539
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,303
The whee... Yeah. Pop the wheels.

540
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,759
(GASPS) Oh.

541
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,599
- That's it.
- Yeah, you think?

542
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,919
Yeah, I'm tall. Look at this.

543
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,279
(MUTTERING)

544
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,439
Hey, you guys have a wall of fame

545
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,239
just like the Jolly Wrenches.

546
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,479
So, what's the deal?

547
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,480
What do you have to do to
get your picture up here?

548
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,439
Crash.

549
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,639
Oh.

550
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:48,439
Yeah, it's dangerous work,

551
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,420
but that's the job of a firefighter.

552
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,479
Risking their lives for
people they don't even know.

553
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,301
They fly in when
others are flying out.

554
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,503
It takes a special kind of plane.

555
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,559
BLADE:
Fighting wildfire means flying low.

556
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:08,399
And that's why we
have Augerin Canyon,

557
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,759
our own little obstacle course.

558
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,399
All you gotta do is
stay below the rim,

559
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,799
and when you get to the bridge,

560
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,439
fly under and pull out.

561
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,519
Flying low. No problem.

562
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,799
Overconfidence,

563
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,031
the kind of attitude
that can get you killed.

564
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,706
Okay, now, let's see you
make it under that bridge.

565
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,159
Why did you pull power?
You gotta firewall it.

566
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,959
The bridge, it's too
close to the falls.

567
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,119
No excuses.

568
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,384
If there had been a downdraft,
you'd be dead.

569
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:49,279
Make a normal seaplane approach.

570
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,359
Stay on the step

571
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,119
while collecting water
through the scoops.

572
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,359
Just like that.

573
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,119
Climb out loaded, return to your
holding orbit, and drop as directed.

574
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,199
Copy that?

575
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,701
Copy that.

576
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,359
Okay, you've got 12 to
15 seconds to scoop...

577
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:02,999
Then 50 feet to climb out.

578
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,879
And watch out for the tree!

579
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,479
Indirect attack,
parallel attack, direct attack.

580
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,479
Know what your fire
is doing at all times.

581
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,559
Wind speed and direction.

582
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,959
Temperature, relative humidity.

583
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,039
And finally, all aircraft
must be on the ground

584
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:15,719
30 minutes after sunset.

585
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,639
Flying low at night
is the fastest way

586
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,585
to get your picture on the wall.

587
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,541
Too early.

588
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,901
Too high!

589
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,839
Too low.

590
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,662
Those crops of yours, they die a lot?

591
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,159
Approach looks good.

592
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,199
Now, increase your air speed.

593
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,359
Redline it.

594
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,679
Go to max torque.

595
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,759
Don't back off.

596
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,199
(ALARM PULSING)

597
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,559
Don't back off!

598
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,599
Oh, why did you bail out again?

599
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,140
If you don't push it, you're not gonna
make it and you won't be certified.

600
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,279
Good job!

601
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,545
You just saved those folks
from a nice vacation.

602
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,759
SKIPPER: Propwash Junction to Dusty.

603
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:19,559
Come in, Dusty.
Propwash Junction to Dusty.

604
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,639
Hey, Skipper.

605
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,919
Hey! How's it going?

606
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,599
This is tougher than I thought,

607
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,559
but it is so good to hear from you.

608
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,639
Well, we wanted to radio...

609
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,959
Skip, let me tell him.

610
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,119
Oh, all right, Chug.

611
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,319
- Tell me what?
- Okay.

612
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,239
That we... (CHUCKLES)

613
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,319
Oh, I can't!

614
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,439
You tell him, Sparky.

615
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,559
Uh, well.

616
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,119
So, okay, there's this
fella out in California.

617
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,319
CHUG: California!

618
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,879
The Skipper and I know him from back
when we were stationed in Coronado.

619
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,999
Near San Diego!

620
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,319
We all used to go down to Baja.

621
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,719
Near Coronado!

622
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,119
Oh, boy, there was this one
time we went to this bar,

623
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,999
and Skipper put a hula skirt
and coconuts on his...

624
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,079
- SKIPPER: Sparky!
- Right, okay. Sorry. Sorry.

625
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,959
The point is, he has one of your...

626
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,999
Gearboxes!

627
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,159
We got the gearbox!

628
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:59,519
You got the... You got the...
Are you kidding me?

629
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,839
Oh, wait. It gets better.

630
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,759
He's going to ship it out tonight.

631
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,679
We'll have it in a couple of days!

632
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,799
This is the best news.

633
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,359
This is just what I
needed to hear right now.

634
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,999
We'll let you know as
soon as we get it.

635
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,959
Hey, Dusty! Listen to my new siren.

636
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,399
(GRUNTS)

637
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,823
(SQUEAKING)

638
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,119
Huh?

639
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,879
DOTTIE: Yeah, I haven't actually

640
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,382
hooked up his siren yet.

641
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,359
PATCH: All aircraft, be advised...

642
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,039
Something's up. I gotta go, guys.

643
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,719
I repeat, Superintendent Spinner

644
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,519
has entered the base.

645
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,039
What's going on?

646
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,799
Park superintendent.

650
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,399
Park superintendent coming.

651
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,399
I sign your paychecks.
Anybody gonna greet me?

652
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,519
Yes, you are!

653
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,719
I got some oil pans to change.

654
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,879
Blade, Blade, Blade.

655
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,039
What do you want, Cad?

656
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,599
That's a big hill. Listen.

657
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,959
Do you think I like
driving all around

658
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,799
over here and up there,
over there just to complain?

659
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,239
Answer... No, I don't.

660
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,839
But, I heard from some campers
that one of your staff

661
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,079
just soaked them with that red fire
phosphorescent stuff that you use.

662
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,239
The deodorant.

663
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,319
DUSTY:
Yeah, I'm sorry. That was my fault.

664
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,479
The team needs to train.

665
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,759
There's gonna be some mud
spilled along the way.

666
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,919
Are you kidding me?

667
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,679
- No, that's the way it works.
- No, you are not!

668
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,479
Blade, you're hiding
a world famous racer

669
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,399
right here at Piston Peak!

670

Ripslinger!

Uh, it's "Crophopper."

672
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,519
Crophopper!

673
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,719
- Dusty.
- Yeah, right.

674
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,079
Me, Cad Spinner. You, one fast plane.

675
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,279
What are you doing up here?

676
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,439
- Well, I'm getting...
- Doesn't matter.

677
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,879
Tomorrow night. The lodge.

678
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,759
Grand reopening party.
You're invited!

679
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,999
And I'm thinking,

680
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,945
high-speed flyover.
What are you thinking?

681
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:43,181
I'm thinking it'll be...
It'll be dark.

682
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:45,199
Hey! There's gonna be a lot of VIPs.

683
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,599
"Very Important Planes."

684
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,079
How would you like
to rub tires with the

685
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,599
Secretary of the Interior
of the United States

686
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,119
of America?

687
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,543
I smell photo op! Flash! Cha-ching.

688
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,599
I smell something else.

689
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,719
Blade, Blade, Blade.

690
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,079
Can I explain something? Yes, I can.

691
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,439
Look, spilling mud on people
makes for sad campers.

692
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,599
Big party at my lodge
makes for happy campers.

693
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,879
You understand?

694
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,879
You've packed too many
happy campers into the park

695
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,919
and way too many into that lodge.

696
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,119
Oh, we've got a structural fire
engine down there protecting it.

697
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,319
This isn't just about
protecting the lodge.

698
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,479
There's low humidity...

He got the Park Service to
shift 80 percent of our budget

00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,639
to his lodge restoration project.

701
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,799
This base is held together with
baling wire and duct tape!

702
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,462
Maru had to rebuild
that old tower himself.

703
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,439
It's better than new!

Cad, you got 30 seconds. Go.

00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,319
Ah, I don't care how much it costs.

Yes, get the crystal glasses.

Yes, fluted! Were you
built in a barn? Come on!

710
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,759
The lodge is only gonna
be grand-reopened once.

711
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,591
I'm not gonna...

712
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,905
Could you hold on a second?

713
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,679
Then fire the old lady,

714
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,262
and get somebody who can get them!

715
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,759
You're not the only ones
who can put out a fire, right?

Yes, I will. (CLICKING TONGUE)

You like "Inferno"?

It was either that, or "Maelstrom,"

I just don't get something.

what is he doing here?

- I don't know.
- We don't know!

It's like my fiance.
He just vanished. Poof!

this kind of stuff is classified.

- I'm sure he could tell us.
- Yes!

794
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,519
- But he'd have to kill us.
- I don't want to die!

795
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,039
Whatever the reason is,

796
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:31,340
it's his business,
and we're not asking.

practicing so hard.

808
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:06,759
- This ain't no campfire.
- Come on, I can do this.

809
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,239
- You're not certified.
- Just give him a shot.

810
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,399
He's not certified!

811
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,585
We need every plane we've got.

812
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,065
I want to help.

813
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,439
Maru!

814
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,941
Yeah, Blade?

815
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,079
Load him up.

816
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,264
Okay!

817
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,866
What was that for?

818
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,991
The wall.

819
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,199
BLADE: Dipper, move into position.

820
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,039
Split load. Coverage level eight.

BLADE: Come left one
wingspan on your next drop.

823
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,119
Champ, tag on and extend.

824
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,304
- Split load.
- Copy that.

825
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,639
BLADE: Too high!

826
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,079
It all dispersed.

827
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,799
Windlifter, finish off that ridge.

828
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,904
Windlifter copies.

829

DYNAMITE: Pull back!

830
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,788
Pull back! Let's go,
let's go right now!

831
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,839
Blade, we got a situation.

832
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,959
The wind shifted.
The fire jumped the line.

833
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,159
BLADE:
Can you make it to your safety zone?

834
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,503
No, no good.
Our escape route is blocked.

835
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,919
We need a drop.

836
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,759
Copy that. Dipper,
smokejumpers trapped.

837
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,159
Left flank, set up for a drop.

838
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,708
DUSTY: I see them. I've got it.

839
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,199
DYNAMITE: All right. We're clear.

840
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,199
Let's move. Let's get to the lake.

841
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:53,039
DIPPER: That's my Dust Muffin!

842
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,839
BLADE: Champ, load and return.

843
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,519
We still got a lot of work to do.

844
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,510
Copy that.

845
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,279
PATCH: Dynamite just reported in.

846
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,199
They're gonna camp out tonight
and mop it up tomorrow.

847

MARU: Cabbie, how's it looking?

848
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,479
We got that sucker boxed in.

849
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,559
Nice work!

850
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,141
CABBIE: That's why we're here.

851
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,239
(SIGHS) So, that's it?

852
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,039
Yep, fire is contained.

853
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,559
The jumpers will stir
on it until it's out.

854
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,479
You did a great job out there,
sweet SEAT.

855
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,079
Thanks. I saw the
jumpers in trouble...

856
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,239
You broke formation
in a crowded airspace.

857
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:29,519
Could've been you spread all over
the woods instead of retardant.

858
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:33,079
Don't go planning your
certification party yet, Champ.

859
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,239
Oh, man.

860
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,028
Come on, that's just Blade's
way of saying "Good job."

861
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,909
Whoa. That was low.

862
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,519
Cad's VIPs.

863
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,759
Oh, yeah, that's right.

864
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,159
He's having a big party
up at the lodge tonight.

865
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,439
We should go!

866
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,919
A second date? Wow! Room!

867
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,719
Uh, I kind of meant all of us.

868
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,919
You know, you and me,
and Windlifter, and just everybody.

869
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:57,759
Oh! Okay.

870
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,279
Okay, okay, yeah. Mmm-hmm.

871
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,439
You're right, you're right.

872
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:02,704
I should get to know your friends.

873
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:06,559
But they're your friends.

874
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,039
(CHUCKLES) Well, yeah, I guess. Yeah.

875
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,780
Let's not bicker.

DUSTY: Whoa! Look at this place.

880
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,719
DIPPER: It's so beautiful.

881
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:34,159
Dusty-poo, this is the perfect date!

882
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,999
Let's check it out
before we check in.

883
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,359
- Hey, there, folks.
- Hi.

884
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:41,227
Like to get your picture taken
with the superintendent?

885
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,599
- Uh...
- Ha!

886
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,039
Classy.

887
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:46,359
Oui, you're all set

Wow.

Oh, this is so exciting,
I'm gonna overheat!

899
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,199
to the grand reopening weekend
of the magnificent...

900
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,799
It's a pleasure to be here, Spinner.

901
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,519
And is it a pleasure to
see you, sir? Yes, it is.

902
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,399
So, now, what's this
I hear about a fire?

903
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,519
Uh, fire...

904
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:18,159
The Whitewall Fire is contained, sir.

905
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,319
- Right.
- It's under control.

906
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,359
It's absolutely under control.

907
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,559
- Thank you...
- Engine Pulaski, sir.

908
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:22,639
- Who-ski?
- "Pulaski."

909
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,999
Right. Anyway, right this way, sir.

00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,519
And if there's any other
questions you have for me,

please, I am your man.

912

Don't even have normal coffee here.

I had to get something
called a "Highway Expresso."

What do you think?

915

- You look good.
- Eh.

916
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:39,279
Tell me, how's the park's
indigenous wildlife population?

917

- The what?
- The wildlife.

Oh, the wildlife!

919
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:45,439
Well, if you come to the party tonight,
there'll be plenty of party animals.

Ho, ho, ho. Huh?

921
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,719
I see. Yes.

922
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,199
The deer population is steady.

923
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,639
And we've had a healthy increase

924
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,599
in the number of

- Okay.
- I'm up for a promotion.

You understand.
You're upwardly mobile, right?

- Sure.
- Of course, you are. You're a plane.

Great, come over here.

952

It's our anniversary.

953
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,119
- We honeymooned here 50 years ago.
- Can you believe it?

954
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,439
I was 50 years younger
and half a ton lighter.

955
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,519
More to love!

is trying to find the spot
where we had our first kiss.

Oh, that is so sweet!

like that anymore.

Honey, honey, listen,
I'm telling you.

961
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:01,708
There was a bridge, and a
magnificent waterfall, and...

962
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,506
You.

963
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:08,182
I love you, Harvey.

that sounds like Augerin Canyon.

By Whitewash Falls!

968
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,399
See? I told you I knew where it was.

969
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,199
Hey, in honor of your anniversary,

970
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:19,519
why don't you join us?

971
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:20,999
We'll buy you a can of oil, on me.

972
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:23,309
Oh, thank you, dear.

973
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:24,479
Oh, sure, sure.

974
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:26,159
I've been around
the block a few times.

975
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,959
I worked as a taco truck,

976
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,479
sold carwash curtain
rings for a while.

977
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,839
Then, I got into RV tire sales.

978
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,639
Winnie here was my showroom model.

979
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,479
That's how we met.

980
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:37,639
- It's true.
- Aw, nice.

981
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:40,639
For our wedding day, bought her
the best set of whitewalls.

982
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,319
We wore off the treads
on our honeymoon.

983
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,159
Yeah, oh...

984
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:47,319
- Driving!
- Oh, driving! Of course!

985
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,479
She said "Driving."

986
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,999
- Delete that thought.
- Deleted!

987
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,039
HARVEY: You know, Dusty...

988
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:53,839
Maybe this firefighting thing
will be a second career for you.

989
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,159
Oh, yeah. This is a second
career for all of us.

990
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,679
Windlifter was a lumberjack,
Cabbie was in the military,

991
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:01,359
and me, well, I hauled
cargo up in Anchorage.

992
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,599
Yeah, a lot of guys up in Anchorage.

993
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,359
I was beating them off with a stick.
(VOCALIZING)

994
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:06,879
"Come here, boy. No." Boom!

995
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,239
Hey, big whirlybird,
you haven't said much.

996
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,759
How about a toast?

997
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:13,039
Uh, Windlifter's not really
much for speeches.

998
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,224
(CHANTING)

999
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,904
A toast to Coyote.

1000
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:27,359
It was he who drove
all day and all night

1001
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,879
to the base of Bright Mountain.

1002
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,599
With much difficulty,

1003
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,359
he climbed the mountain
to obtain fire,

1004
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:37,359
and brought it down
to the first vehicles.

1005
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:40,279
But in so doing, he burned his tires.

1006
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,879
And when Coyote saw
his blackened tires,

1007
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,119
he thought they were
his favorite snack,

1008
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,039
and he ate them!

1009
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,639
For he knew they
were still full of life.

1010
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:55,399
And it was in this way,
he let go of the old,

1011
00:46:55,400 --> 00:47:01,304
and renewed himself like
fire renews the earth.

1012
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:06,919
Uh, I'm just gonna say it.

1013
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,199
You had me up until the part
where he eats his own tires.

1014
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:10,279
(CHUCKLES)

1015
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:11,919
Best toast ever, Wind.

1016
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:13,079
Cheers!

1017
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:14,991
ALL: Cheers!

1018
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,639
SKIPPER: Propwash Junction to Dusty.

1019
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:24,679
Oh? Huh? Oh? Oh, oh.

1020
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,319
Come in, Dusty. Come in, Dusty.

1021
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,279
Propwash Junction to Dusty.

1022
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,679
Hey, Skip.

1023
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:31,839
Oh.

1024
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:33,359
What's up?

1025
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,101
Oh, did the gearbox come in?

1026
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,511
Well, we...

1027
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,279
What?

1028
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:42,599
SPARKY: So...

1029
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,959
Dust...

1030
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:47,509
Sparky, I'll tell him.

1031
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:52,543
It was the wrong one.

1032
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:57,631
The crate... it was mislabeled.

1033
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:01,559
We've called every parts
supplier, repair shop,

1034
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:04,791
and junkyard in the country.

1035
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,827
Nobody has your gearbox.

1036
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,460
Dusty?

1037
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,381
I'm here.

1038
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:21,071
I'm sorry.

1039
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,505
I gotta go.

1040
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,345
Thanks.

1041
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,066
PATCH:
All aircraft, we've got two fires.

1042
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:40,839
MARU: Hey, Crophopper.

1043
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:43,719
Get this, Cad's fancy jet VIPs

1044
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:46,359
flew in too low over the
burn area last night,

1045
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,067
blew embers in all directions.

1046
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,359
BLADE: Champ,

1047
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:53,430
let's load and go.

1048
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:57,879
The fire broke containment
and split in two.

1049
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:00,359
Windlifter, you and Dipper
take the Coil Springs fire.

1050
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,399
Me and the SEAT will
take Whitewall Rapids.

1051
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,709
Windlifter copies.

1052
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,799
- Maru, come in.
- Yeah, Blade?

1053
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,239
- It's worse than we thought.
- Yeah?

1054
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:22,599
Get on the horn to the lodge.

1055
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,719
That fire is about four hours
from their front door.

1056
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,039
They're gonna have to evacuate.

1057
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,399
Absolutely not!

1058
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,799
MARU: Blade insists.

1059
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,039
To be safe, you gotta
get everyone out.

1060
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,839
I've been working on this
lodge for five years.

1061
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:35,239
I'm not gonna evacuate
now just to be "safe."

1062
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,239
MARU: You got less than four hours.

1063
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,439
Why am I talking to you?

1064
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,559
Where's Blade?

1065
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,479
Oh, he's out back
sipping a motorjito.

1066
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,999
Where do you think he is?

1067
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:44,879
He's out fighting the fire!

1068
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,279
BLADE: If we're gonna save the lodge,

1069
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,239
we've gotta keep this fire
from cresting the ridge.

1070
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,319
I'll drop, then you
tag on and extend.

1071
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,319
And make it a split load.

1072
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,119
That way, we can double up and
widen it downwind of the ridge...

1073
00:49:55,120 --> 00:49:58,279
DOTTIE: If you push yourself
into the red, you'll crash.

1074
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,079
CHUG: Nobody has your gearbox.

1075
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,741
BLADE: Copy that?

1076
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,399
- Hey! You copy that?
- Huh?

1077
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:06,028
Yeah. Yes. Copy that.

1078
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,310
You gotta be kidding me.

1079
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,079
- Was that your whole tank?
- Yeah.

1080
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:26,279
You just wasted all of it.

1081
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:27,519
I was just following your orders.

1082
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:28,759
I said, "Split load."

1083
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,439
We were going to make a secondary
line to protect that lodge.

1084
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:32,679
It'll be fine. I can
reload at the lake.

1085
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:34,159
Negative! Return to base.

1086
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,799
No! There's no time.
Let's just get this fire out.

1087
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,359
Hey, hey! You need to listen to me!

1088
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:40,305
I'll be fine!

1089
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,799
BLADE: These crosswinds are
too strong. Return to base!

1090
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,279
DUSTY:
This is what you trained me to do!

1091
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,799
BLADE: Not under these conditions.

1092
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:48,839
If we're gonna get this fire out,
I've gotta reload.

1093
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:51,661
- Pull up, that's an order!
- No, I can do this.

1094
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,150
Oh! Ah!

1095

(ENGINE STALLING)

1096
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,359
I've taken in too much water.

1097
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:03,431
- My engine stalled.
- Stalled?

1098
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:09,479
Keep your pontoons downstream.
I'll keep ahead of you.

1099
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,559
DUSTY: I'll get out on my own.

1100
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,679
BLADE:
How you planning on doing that?

1101
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,386
DUSTY: I'll restart my engine.

1102
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,027
BLADE: Just hang on.
I'm gonna pull you to shore.

1103
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,341
Got it!

1104
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,901
Ah!

(GRUNTS)

1106
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,519
Ah. Ah!

1107
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,599
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

1108
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:34,679
There's too much coverage.

1109
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,079
Don't worry, I'll get you
at the next clearing.

1110
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,581
Right.

Blade!

1117
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:57,559
Oh, come on.

1118
00:51:57,560 --> 00:51:58,879
You need to start your engine.

1119
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,621
You've got clear water.
You can take off before the falls.

It's your only chance.

00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:09,239

1123
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:10,787

00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,190
Redline it! Redline it!

1128
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,182
Why are you holding back? Redline it!

1129
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,622
Ah! Oh!

1130
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,065
(GRUNTING)

1131
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:38,799
Why didn't you redline it?

1132
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,349
You could've made it!
What were you thinking?

1133
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:45,948
DUSTY: What? What's wrong?

1134
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,519
This ain't good.

1135
00:52:50,520 --> 00:52:53,671
Head down that path. Follow me.

1136
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:57,585
Champ, come on!

1137
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,039
In here.

1138
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:02,319
An old mine? We can't go in there.

1139
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:03,639
We'll suffocate!

1140
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:05,239
It's our only chance.
We'll let it burn over.

1141
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,439
No, you go on. I'll keep moving.

1142
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,227
What are you doing? Hey. Hey!

1143
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,719
You can't outrun the fire.

1144
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:13,359
You know what? I'll find my way out.

1145
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:15,199
Like you found your
way out of the rapids.

1146
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,239
I didn't want to push my engine.

1147
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,039
- You didn't "want" to?
- Blade, listen to me.

1148
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,599
This isn't about you.
This is about life and death.

1149
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,959
You need to follow orders.

1150
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,079
I told you, "Split load,"
you dropped it all.

1151
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,639
I told you not to reload on
the lake, you did it anyway.

1152
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,439
I told you, "Redline it,"
you pulled power.

1153
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,839
You don't have what it takes!
You don't!

1154
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:34,759
Fine! I never wanted to
be a firefighter anyway!

1155
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,466
Then go back to racing!

1156
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,279
Go win yourself another
trophy, Champ.

1157
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,639
I can't!

1158
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,839
My gearbox is busted! All right?

1159
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,439
That's why I pulled power.

1160
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,466
I'm never gonna...

1161
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,119
Life doesn't always go
the way you expect it.

1162
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:00,999
But you came here to
become a firefighter.

1163
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,799
If you give up today,

1164
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:06,782
think of all the lives
you won't save tomorrow.

1165
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,468
So, what are you going to do?

1166
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:48,025
(COUGHS)

1167
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,479
Is it a beautiful day
here at Piston Peak Park?

1168
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,879
Yes, it is!

1169
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,999
Thanks for coming out, everybody.

1170
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,639
And I'd like to give
a special welcome

1171
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:10,239
to the Secretary of the Interior

1172
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,279
who is joining us for the unveiling of
this commemorative... (CLEARS THROAT)

1173
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,519
Plaque.

1174
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,306
The safety of the
tourists is at stake!

1175
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,599
(LAUGHS) Sorry about that.

1176
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:21,785
If you could excuse me for a moment,
ladies and gentlemen. Thank you.

1177
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:23,279
Am I giving a speech?

1178
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:24,599
Yes, I am, Pnewski.

1179
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:25,719
- No, sir, "Pulaski."
- Papooski.

1180
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,839
- "Pulaski."
- P'tootsie.

1181
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:28,580
"Pulaski."

1182
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:31,239
That's what I said.
We're saying the same thing.

1183
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,239
With all due respect,
Superintendent Spinner,

1184
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,959
the smoke over the ridge
is growing closer.

1185
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:38,279
Yeah, perhaps we should
turn on the roof sprinklers?

1186
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,559
We must evacuate.

1187
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:41,239
Better listen to them, Cad.
They're right.

1188
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:42,679
Come on, Spinner!
Let's see that plaque.

1189
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,759
Right away, sir!

1190
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,999
We need to cancel the unveiling.

1191
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:46,399
The longer we wait,
the worse it'll get.

1192
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,319
(MUTTERING) Who are you?

1193
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,519
You're a glorified bell boy.

1194
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,759
You're an overpriced sprinkler,

1195
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,959
and you're old, and you
have a dumb hat on.

1196
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,599
Who am I? I'm the Superintendent,
and today is about me and my lodge.

1197
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,307
And now is the moment
I've been waiting for!

1198
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,919
(SCREAMING)

1199
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,159
Now, that's just rude.

1200
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,946
- CAR: Fire!
- Oh.

1201
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,070
Let's get out of here.

1202
00:56:10,080 --> 00:56:12,079
(SCREAMING)

1203
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,999
Quickly! Quickly. We must evacuate.

1204
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,079
Don't panic! We must evacuate!

1205
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,679
OL' JAMMER:
This is a mandatory evacuation,

1206
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,399
but we have plenty of time.

1207
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:20,839
Keep moving.

1208
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:22,079
Keep going at a steady pace.

1209
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,999
Keep moving slowly, but carefully.

1210
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,479
All right. Look,
there's no need to panic.

1211
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:26,799
It's really just a small,
little fire.

1212
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,759
If you all just calm down,
you can come back next year.

1213
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,479
Sure, you can all
come back next year.

1214
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,550
I'll see you right here!

1215
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:36,749
PULASKI: Move along. That's it.

1216
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,239
And remember, avoid the smoke,
stay above the canyon walls,

1217
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,479
you'll be okay.

1218
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,879
All right, next, please.

1219
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:44,825
(STRAINING)

1220
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:47,879
Out of my way, tail dragger.

1221
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,399
Hold on, there, big fella.
No cutsies.

1222
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,231
You don't want to
upset my buddy, here.

1223
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,199
(WHIRRING)

1224
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,559
PULASKI: All right, ma'am,
you're clear for takeoff.

1225
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,679
Thank you!

1226
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,319
PULASKI: Remember to avoid the smoke

1227
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:01,599
and stay above the canyon walls!

1228
00:57:01,600 --> 00:57:05,239
CONCIERGE PITTY:
Move along. Quickly, please.

1229
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,879
I'm sorry. I am sorry. That is all.

1230
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,359
The train is full.

1231
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,519
Remaining guests,
please follow a staff member.

1232
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,439
They will lead you to
the main road exit.

1233
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,959
All aboard!

1234
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:15,905
(HOOTING)

1235
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,549
(THUDDING)

1236
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,905
(GRUNTS)

1237
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:43,266
(COUGHS)

1238
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,239
Blade...

1239
00:57:51,240 --> 00:57:53,947
BLADE: Airway Meadow should be clear.

1240
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,439
We'll take off from there.

1241
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:59,271
Let's go.

1242
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,750
Blade!

1243
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:18,159
Blade!

1244
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:19,679
Patch, come in,
this is Crophopper Seven.

1245
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,079
Patch, come in!

1246
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,599
PATCH: I read you, Crophopper Seven.

1247
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:25,039
Blade is down.
I repeat, Blade is down!

1248
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,999
I'll send Windlifter to respond.

1249
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,831
Stay at your location.

1250
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,159
MARU: Okay, that's good. Slow, slow.

1251
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:33,741
Good, good.

1252
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:35,879
Careful!

1253
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:37,319
Good. We're good!

1254
00:58:37,320 --> 00:58:38,839
Pinecone, get those straps off.

1255
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:39,959
- Avalanche?
- Yes!

1256
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,906
Push the ramp alongside the
access panel and be careful.

1257
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,239
He'll be okay, right?

1258
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:48,319
It's bad, but, Maru,
he's the best there is.

1259
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,106
He'll make him better than new.

1260
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,879
His hydraulics are completely fried.

1261
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,039
He's losing fluids.

1262
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,599
I gotta get him back
to the garage, stat.

1263
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,079
Dynamite, tow hook!

1264
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:58,279
Coming right up.

1265
00:58:58,280 --> 00:58:59,719
I'm gonna need hydraulic
fluid from the shed.

1266
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:00,799
Copy that.

1267
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:02,759
- Blackout, we'll need another generator.
- I got it!

1268
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,839
Try the main hangar.

1269
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,239
- And grab another heat lamp!
- BLACKOUT: Yes, boss!

1270
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:06,639
The surface burns are bad,

1271
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:08,479
but the interior
damage is repairable.

1272
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,142
As long as we move quick,
we got a good chance.

1273
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:20,506
DUSTY: How is he?

1274
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,959
He's resting now.

1275
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,359
Oh.

1276
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,624
I've done everything I can.

1277
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:30,919
(SIGHS)

1278
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:32,199
Do you think he's gonna be...

1279
00:59:32,200 --> 00:59:35,146
Look, Dusty, don't blame yourself.

1280
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:37,119
He should have left me out there.

1281
00:59:37,120 --> 00:59:38,519
Nah.

1282
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:40,909
That ain't Blade's style.

1283
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:45,319
Especially since what
happened to Nick.

1284
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,399
Nick?

1285
