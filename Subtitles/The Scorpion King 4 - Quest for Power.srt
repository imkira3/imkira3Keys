2
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,130
What's that?

3
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,767
Halt!

4
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,409
You there! Stop!

5
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,969
- Water.
- Who did this to you?

6
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,486
A monster.

7
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,722
The most hideous and deformed
creature to ever roam the desert.

8
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,924
They call him

9
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,522
the Scorpion King.

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,820
That's just an old campfire story.

11
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,740
The Scorpion King's not real.

12
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,961
Boo.

13
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,460
Take him!

14
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,766
Sword!

15
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,886
Really?

16
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,561
The most hideous,
deformed creature to roam the desert?

17
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,445
Well, you do look a little tired.

18
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,740
How come I always have to
get dragged by the camel?

19
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,500
Because I am the master
and you are the apprentice.

20
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,020
Partner.

21
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,140
Helper.

22
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,020
Come on. I've followed you for a year.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,890
Think of what we've
been through together.

24
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,091
We're a team.

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,140
Okay. Fine.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,646
Partner.

27
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,740
Live free.

28
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,041
Die well.

29
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,890
That must be the treasure room.

30
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,860
Allow me.

31
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,846
Hey!

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,401
Well, that's inconvenient.

33
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,540
Now what?

34
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,841
Don't move.

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,330
Well, that wasn't too bad.

36
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,245
You were saying?

37
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,860
We could go back.

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,481
If that's where the treasure room is,
that's where we're going.

39
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,129
Ready? Watch out.

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,761
Now. And one, two...

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,740
Don't get any funny ideas.

42
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,087
With your breath?

43
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,605
Follow my lead.

44
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,610
I hope that's your knife in your pocket.

45
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,651
Get off!

46
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,889
There it is. The urn of Kings.

47
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,620
They say whoever can
decipher those inscriptions

48
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,924
will find the key to unstoppable power.

49
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,081
Do you believe that?

50
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,086
I don't need to believe it.

51
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,204
We just need to grab it and get paid.

52
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,700
Have a think about it, Mathayus.

53
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,020
The power. The glory.

54
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,740
With this, we could rule
the world together.

55
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,246
Wait.

56
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,921
Replace it with this.

57
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,380
Any more bright ideas?

58
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,648
Yeah. Let's go fishing.

59
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,648
Okay. Ready? Pull.

60
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,850
That's good. Go! Go!

61
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,080
Stop!

62
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,084
We should keep the urn!

63
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,365
No! I'm taking it to Al-Moraad.

64
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,006
I swore an oath to the King.

65
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,327
You have much to learn, Drazen.

66
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,569
And yet there's so much
you've taught me already.

67
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,645
What do you think you're
doing in my palace?

68
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,300
Redecorating?

69
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,763
Nobody steals from me.

70
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,562
Stupid fool.

71
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,810
Get ready to die.

72
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,561
How's that for fishing?

73
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,321
Better late than never!

74
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,160
Getting a little...

75
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,527
Tie him up! Reel him in!

76
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,050
Get the urn!

77
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,580
- Hand it to me!
- Here.

78
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,041
Now let's get out of here.

79
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,060
Help me move this thing.

80
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,409
You are everything your
legend foretold, Scorpion King.

81
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,420
- You're betraying me.
- I've followed you long enough.

82
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,405
You see, I have bigger ambitions
than just being a warrior.

83
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,366
It takes more than a sword
and a crown to be king, Drazen.

84
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,810
But I have more. I have the urn.

85
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:01,207
Thank you, Mathayus. For everything.

86
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,327
And this is why I work alone.

87
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,260
Mathayus of Akkad.

88
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,260
Last of the Black Scorpion Warriors.

89
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,766
Your Majesty.

90
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,563
You were chosen for one
simple but important task.

91
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,371
And I will complete that task.

92
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,570
Do you know who that is?

93
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,086
That's Lord Alcaman. The last
king to rule the entire world.

94
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,680
How did he do it?

95
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,924
He must have commanded a large army.

96
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,046
No. He was a sorcerer.

97
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:54,540
He walked on air, he commanded fire,

98
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,604
and he had dark magic.

99
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,980
And the key to his power is
painted on the side of an urn.

100
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,260
That urn is now in the hands of a fool.

101
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,925
I'll find Drazen.

102
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,125
I will hunt him down and bring
his head to you on a spike.

103
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,006
No. You won't.

104
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:16,120
Drazen wasn't only a thief.
He was also a spy.

105
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,689
Clever enough to fool us both.

106
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,900
He came from the Northern forest.

107
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,260
A kingdom called Norvania.

108
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,220
Your Majesty, give me a dozen men.

109
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,100
I will burn that castle to the ground.

110
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,780
I will bury them under it
and bring you the urn.

111
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,320
Sire?

112
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,809
This is a peace agreement.
You will give it to him.

113
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,180
You can't be serious.

114
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:47,008
Unless you bring me the urn,
we only have one choice.

115
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,530
Your Highness, I am not the person
that you send to make peace.

116
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,400
I will not go.

117
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,740
<i>The location of Alcaman's legendary
fortress has been lost over time,</i>

118
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,123
<i>with all its secret magic locked inside.</i>

119
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,700
<i>Wise kings understood that magic
power is better left untouched.</i>

120
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,700
<i>It is too powerful in mortal hands.</i>

121
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,243
<i>The fate of the world rests
on your shoulders now.</i>

122
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,808
<i>Make peace, my warrior son.</i>

123
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,085
There he is.

124
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,320
Father.

125
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,020
Look at you.

126
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,140
- How long has it been?
- One year.

127
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,020
Operating inside the
palace of King Zakkour.

128
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,780
Fighting alongside one of his
top mercenaries, an Akkadian warrior.

129
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,180
- An Akkadian?
- Yes.

130
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,860
And I suspect he is kicking himself now.

131
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,891
Why? Did you bring me something?

132
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,448
The urn of Kings.

133
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,167
Father, no...

134
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,242
You have delivered the
future of our great kingdom.

135
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,921
It's a key?

136
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,540
The Golden Key of Lord Alcaman.

137
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,763
If we can decipher its inscriptions,

138
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,084
it will lead us to powers
no kingdom can imagine.

139
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:22,121
And you have kept it from our enemies.

140
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,487
What is that? What's on its back?

141
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,089
What manner of horse is that?

142
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,845
That's not a horse, you idiot.

143
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,845
It's called a giraffe.

144
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,802
They're from the Southern lands.

145
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,967
Sir...

146
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,603
Barkeep. Ale, please.

147
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,300
I need to see the King.

148
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,001
Stranger, he's not a nice man.

149
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,860
Best you finish your drink and leave.

150
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:23,323
Thanks for the advice,
but I still need to see the King.

151
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,140
I know the King. I work for him.

152
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,340
Oh.

153
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,340
You're in the royal band.

154
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,802
We are the King's guards.

155
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:41,409
You wanna get to him,
you gotta go through us.

156
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,606
Well, that could be fun.

157
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,380
Where are you from, stranger?

158
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,650
I have a message from King
Zakkour at Al-Moraad.

159
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,691
And I come in peace.

160
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,800
All by yourself? In Norvania?

161
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,380
Well, you're either the
dumbest man on Earth,

162
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,365
or I'm imagining this
whole conversation.

163
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,044
Let me see.

164
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,684
Nope, he's real.

165
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,728
Which means he must be dumb.

166
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,082
I come in peace.

167
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,740
Take me to your king. Please.

168
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,883
I have a saying.

169
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,809
The winner of a fight isn't the
stronger man or the more skilled man,

170
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,569
it's the hungriest.

171
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:38,040
Oh, well, then you must
win a lot of fights.

172
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,968
You can laugh. It's funny.

173
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,331
You messed with the wrong soldier.

174
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,168
All right. You've won the fight.

175
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,900
Right.

176
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,125
Now would you please arrest
me and take me to your king?

177
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,886
I said, I need to see the King.

178
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,700
I'll give him your love letter.

179
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,841
Let me guess, you're innocent.

180
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,620
If you could only plead your case
to the King, he'd set you free.

181
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,580
Not that simple.

182
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,460
So you're not just innocent,
you're special.

183
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,620
What if I could arrange a meeting
for you with King Yannick?

184
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,380
Somehow I don't think the King's

185
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,330
royal planning is done from the dungeon.

186
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,780
I have connections, for a price.

187
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,127
You have money?

188
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,931
I'll see what I can do.

189
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,260
Hello, sugar love.

190
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,800
Evening, Roland.

191
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,000
Enjoy.

192
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,220
What's it say?

193
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:59,241
A servant will come, asking for a
volunteer to clean the stables.

194
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,260
Say yes. He'll be sure you
have a moment with the King.

195
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,607
Let me see that.

196
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,009
- It's in code. You wouldn't understand.
- I paid for it. Let me see it.

197
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,004
Don't be a brute.

198
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,683
I could always have one of
the guards fetch it for me.

199
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,645
That's a map of the castle.

200
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,860
Yes, but I wasn't lying about
the servant and the stables.

201
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,446
He comes every day.

202
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,820
And what are you doing
with a map of the castle?

203
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,681
My life's in grave danger.
You wouldn't understand.

204
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,329
So you're not just innocent,
you're special.

205
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,380
If you must know, I am Valina Raskov,

206
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,126
part of the original sacred
blood family of Norvania.

207
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,245
My family guided our
people for generations.

208
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,807
Yannick's rise to power
changed all that.

209
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,460
Let me guess.

210
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,060
You tried to do something about it.

211
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,260
Yes. Now the King's son wants to make

212
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,642
a public spectacle of my death.

213
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,322
If I don't get out of here soon,
he'll get his wish.

214
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,526
You know Drazen?

215
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,966
Please.

216
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,300
One year ago, Drazen and I
were engaged to be married.

217
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:14,940
Something smells very
familiar down here.

218
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,486
Mathayus, it's so good to see
you back in a cage again.

219
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,525
And look who's in the cage next door.

220
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,740
The runaway bride.

221
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,725
Obviously you need to work
on your relationship skills.

222
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,460
You and I could still be partners,
if you weren't so loyal.

223
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,205
Like a dog.

224
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:36,206
Well, she's the one you
want to watch out for.

225
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,564
You think I'm deceptive?

226
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:43,090
She will reel you in and
rip out your heart.

227
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,210
You're an animal.

228
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,530
Then you shouldn't
have tried to tame me.

229
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,609
I'll deal with you later.

230
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,123
You and I are going
to have a cup of tea.

231
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,370
I invented this.
We call it the Man Kettle.

232
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,201
We like to see what bubbles up first,

233
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,330
the truth or the tea.

234
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,580
Now, I'm trying to understand
why you would come here,

235
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,380
pretending to make peace with my father.

236
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,409
I don't lie. You know that.

237
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,131
You're a warrior and a killer.

238
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,340
Aren't you the wrong man to
come here to offer us peace?

239
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,369
That's exactly what I told King Zakkour.

240
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,966
But he sent you anyway.

241
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,762
I'm supposed to believe that?

242
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,684
I betrayed you.

243
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,926
I stole from you. I left you for dead.

244
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,340
Admit it, you've come here to
kill me and steal back the urn.

245
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,940
I come in peace.

246
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,220
Well, you will leave in pieces.

247
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,761
Now what do you really want?

248
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,140
What I want is to rip out your heart,

249
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,140
roast it, and eat it like a leg of lamb.

250
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,620
Is that truth enough for you?

251
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

252
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,327
It is.

253
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,500
It is only my pledge to King Zakkour
that keeps me from killing you.

254
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,926
How honorable.

255
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,660
I accept your offer of peace, Mathayus.

256
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,042
Now, we celebrate.

257
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,380
Guards. I'm sick.

258
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:51,842
I need a doctor.

259
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,842
Drink, boys. To peace.

260
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,740
It takes a brave man
to look beyond himself

261
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,168
and act for the good of his people.

262
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,891
I have no people.

263
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,660
I'm just here to finish a job.

264
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,851
You see, Father, the great Scorpion
King is really just a hired killer.

265
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,580
What he said about ripping
my heart out and eating it?

266
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,450
That's the real Mathayus.

267
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,445
Now, to make it official.

268
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,240
- The King!
- No.

269
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,050
- Father!
- No!

270
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,206
Those are scorpions.

271
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,126
Your own father?

272
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,860
Who's the master now?

273
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,561
In fact, I'm about to be king.

274
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,449
Guards! Come now,
the King has been poisoned!

275
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,086
Alcaman.

276
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,124
Give me that. It's of no use to you.

277
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,765
This man murdered my father.

278
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,684
- Kill him!
- Wait!

279
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,685
We haven't eaten dinner yet.

280
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,606
- What?
- Who's hungry?

281
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,967
Get him!

282
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,525
How's it feel to be king?

283
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,531
Stop him! Get him down!

284
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,245
Cut him off!

285
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,770
Come on, come on, come on!

286
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,966
Kill him!

287
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,820
Careful, Mathayus.
You are a pawn in a game of kings.

288
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,442
No, I'm a warrior with a code of honor.

289
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,540
He poisoned the King,
and now he's escaped.

290
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,763
- Seal the gates.
- Right away.

291
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,620
Please, let me rest here a while.

292
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,443
Don't put me back in my cell.

293
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,643
Come on, man! We need everyone!

294
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,841
Wow.

295
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,690
I'm suddenly feeling better.

296
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,260
Do my spots look any different?

297
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,561
Let me look.

298
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,700
What are you doing?

299
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,540
Escaping.

300
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,569
- What are you doing?
- I'm escaping.

301
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,940
That's what all the commotion's about.
They're chasing after you?

302
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,020
Well, you're going the wrong way.

303
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,900
- You don't wanna go that way.
- And you're ruining my escape.

304
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,406
There they are!

305
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,926
What happened to seeing the King?

306
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,201
The King's dead.

307
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,730
Drazen killed him.

308
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,285
Well, feel free. Escape. Anytime.

309
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,446
I think I will.

310
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,725
What is that?

311
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,925
It's a farewell gift from the King.

312
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,806
Really?

313
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,441
Good luck.

314
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,246
Wait!

315
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,300
Hey!

316
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,647
Really?

317
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,810
Don't mess with sugar love.

318
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,180
Where's the party?

319
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,290
It's a search party,
and it's searching for us.

320
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,640
Let's go!

321
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,051
See you on the outside, friend.

322
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,320
Thanks, sugar love.

323
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,980
I had this all planned out.
You ruined everything.

324
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,900
- You're more than welcome to go alone.
- You've already ruined that option.

325
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,645
Search everywhere.

326
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,460
This might be the worst day of my life.

327
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,780
The worst day of your life was
being locked in that dungeon.

328
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,084
No, it wasn't. You know why?
Because you weren't there.

329
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,881
Go!

330
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,300
Now what?

331
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,761
This way. This way. Let's go.

332
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,380
What are you doing?

333
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,140
You should be alert. Someone's escaping.

334
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,044
- Who?
- Us.

335
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,168
- Follow me. Hold on!
- No, no, no! No!

336
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,620
There they are!

337
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,285
Get off me!

338
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,201
Get them!

339
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,801
Come on, move!

340
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,846
He's yours.

341
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,807
Hurry up!

342
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,300
Cut them off!

343
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,080
Lower the gate. Lower the gate!

344
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,885
Faster! Faster!

345
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,367
Come on!

346
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,044
Go, go, go, go, go!

347
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,620
Hurry!

348
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:45,251
Out of my way!

349
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,011
We're trapped.

350
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,249
- Found yourself another cage, Mathayus.
- Go!

351
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,600
Open the gate!

352
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,641
Quick! Quick! Quick!

353
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,640
Move! Move!

354
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,167
Gotcha!

355
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,380
They've got nowhere to go, come on!

356
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,170
Come on, men! Put your backs into it!

357
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,687
They're trapped!

358
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,888
It appears we took a wrong turn.

359
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,900
You dare escape the wall?

360
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,611
Faster!

361
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,380
Why are you looking down?

362
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,540
Just thinking.

363
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,100
No, no, no, no. You go.
I am not jumping off of this...

364
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,885
Archers!

365
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,100
Get out of my way!

366
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,401
Stop! No, no, no, no!

367
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,580
Ready! Aim!

368
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,247
I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

369
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,940
Fire!

370
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,245
I wish I never met you!

371
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,282
Seriously? Again?

372
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,685
Give me that!

373
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,700
I told you I wouldn't jump.

374
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,900
You didn't jump.

375
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,600
- What do you mean, I didn't jump?
- I pushed you.

376
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,726
I think that's his own cousin.

377
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,646
- Like you've never done that!
- That's awkward.

378
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,100
Well, look at you.

379
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,300
I'm sorry.

380
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,601
For what?

381
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,040
For that.

382
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
- Can you ride like you fight?
- Can you ride without groping me?

383
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,406
Grope all you want.

384
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,727
I got him!

385
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,780
They're escaping. Gather the horses!
Prepare to chase!

386
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,700
- No, let them go.
- Sire?

387
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,040
I said, let them go.

388
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,920
I know where they're going.

389
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,900
You'll have to clean and
stitch that wound soon.

390
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,900
My father lives near here. He can help.

391
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,980
I'll be fine.

392
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,964
He could also decode that key.

393
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,540
That's the key of Lord Alcaman.

394
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,820
It's one of the most powerful
objects in the world,

395
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,260
if you know how to use it.

396
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,244
I appreciate all you've done,
but I work better alone.

397
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,060
Let my father unravel
the mysteries of that key.

398
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,260
We can use its power to defeat Drazen

399
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,211
and restore my family
to its rightful place.

400
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,368
Well, here we are.

401
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,940
One thing. Don't tell my
father who's after us.

402
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:50,140
Daddy doesn't know that his
daughter crossed Drazen.

403
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,940
It's best if we kept it quiet.

404
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,924
He wouldn't understand.

405
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,321
Father?

406
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,360
Valina!

407
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,686
Father.

408
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,340
That's your father?

409
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,980
This all makes so much more sense now.

410
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,931
Valina! Did you see that?

411
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,126
I flew.

412
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,086
Well, I glided for a moment, anyway.

413
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,607
The crash was perhaps not to be desired,

414
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,411
but it proves that human
flight is possible.

415
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,241
Who's this?

416
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,490
Mathayus of Akkad, sir.

417
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,681
What? An Akkadian,
in Norvania, with my daughter.

418
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,260
Did she kidnap you?
You have to watch out for her.

419
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,180
Father, he's hurt.

420
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,940
And he needs our help.

421
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,765
What?

422
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,140
There you are. There.

423
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,284
You see? This is what I
have been working on.

424
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,487
Yeah, up here.

425
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:19,687
It shows the potential for human flight.

426
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,820
And this...

427
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,020
This is my idea for a self-propelled,
people-moving carriage.

428
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,780
My father, Sorrell Raskov,

429
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,220
comes from a sacred line
of wise men and scholars

430
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,761
who have guided the people
of this region for generations.

431
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,890
He should be ruling Norvania.

432
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,086
Not barbarians like
Drazen and his father.

433
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,161
My daughter's been telling
her foolish stories again.

434
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:46,521
Valina! Not every man
is destined to be king.

435
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,126
- Oh! There you are.
- I'll have to agree with him on that one.

436
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,363
Now, you, watch this.

437
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,540
My entire house is powered by wind

438
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,980
and water.

439
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,980
Hey!

440
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,500
You want to cut some wood?

441
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,220
You can chop away all day,
without getting tired.

442
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,060
I call it a "chop-o-matic."

443
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:18,540
Over here.

444
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,251
You see this?

445
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:24,287
This hammer works alone.

446
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,242
And this broom, here, cleans for
you while you just sit and relax.

447
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,531
And if you're tired of
holding something heavy?

448
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,444
I use magnets to make objects float.

449
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,200
It's all about attraction
and repulsion. You see?

450
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,641
Oh!

451
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,690
Well, that needs work.

452
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,220
We need you in the village, Father,

453
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:10,300
leading a revolution. Claiming your
rightful place on the throne.

454
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,420
Not again.

455
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,020
So long as men like Yannick
and Drazen oppress us,

456
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,860
this will always be a dream.

457
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,401
Let me get this straight.

458
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:22,580
Are we not talking about the same
man that you were going to marry?

459
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,770
My plan was to start a rebellion
from inside the palace.

460
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,645
By marrying the King's son?

461
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,361
By getting a foothold
into the system of power.

462
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,300
I just couldn't make
the full commitment.

463
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,601
Why?

464
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,445
You know,

465
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:39,161
the wedding night commitment?

466
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,407
I couldn't go through with it.
Not with Drazen.

467
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,860
Blech.

468
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,764
I left him at the altar at our wedding.

469
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,380
Wedding! Young man.

470
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,660
If you're here to ask for my
daughter's hand in marriage,

471
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,540
I give you my full blessing.

472
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,900
Let her be your disaster
waiting to happen.

473
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,980
Father.

474
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:58,180
It seems you two have a lot to talk about.
Maybe it's best if I just leave.

475
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,420
No, wait.

476
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,960
Sorry.

477
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,340
Father, he's got something to show you.

478
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,166
It's the reason I brought him here.

479
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,167
Show him.

480
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,324
Well, that's very pretty.
All it needs is a giant, golden key ring.

481
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,700
It's the Golden Key of
Lord Alcaman. Isn't it?

482
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,340
You told me about it as a child.

483
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,500
I also told you that Lord Alcaman

484
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,700
and all his grand powers didn't exist.

485
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,460
You don't believe in Lord Alcaman?

486
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,620
My father thinks that world mythology,

487
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,180
all our monsters, gods and heroes,
are just campfire stories.

488
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,180
Invented by men to frighten and rule us.

489
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,020
Everything can be explained by science.

490
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,180
Where'd you get this piece of junk?

491
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,340
In the urn that...

492
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,820
That he found in the woods,
by the marketplace.

493
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,660
Only, he was attacked by thieves,

494
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,691
so I saved him and brought him here.

495
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,460
Do you know what the symbols mean?

496
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,180
Well, legend holds that the
Golden Key of Lord Alcaman

497
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:00,860
leads to the secret palace
where he kept his throne.

498
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,371
Any man of honor who finds the
lost throne and dons the crown

499
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,380
will unlock all of the magic

500
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,444
and ascends to the throne

501
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,564
as king of the world!

502
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,140
Of course, it's all made up.

503
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,740
The man that attacked me is dangerous.

504
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,460
If he gets his hands on the crown, he will
use its powers for evil and personal gain.

505
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,300
Well, with the right amount of power,
every man is dangerous.

506
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,020
Do you see that, Father?
Those are words of a king.

507
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,740
- I don't want to be king!
- Yes, you do.

508
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,100
- No, I do not.
- Yes, you do!

509
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,180
No, in fact, I don't want anything!

510
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,527
Yes, you do.

511
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,780
You want to prove that Lord Alcaman,

512
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,650
one of the great myths of world history,

513
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,571
is nothing but a campfire story.

514
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,700
I'll decipher this,

515
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,721
and I will prove to you there
is no such thing as magic.

516
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,449
Rooster tails have a bit...

517
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,220
Well, it's a riddle!

518
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,646
Did you ever fight for something,

519
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,847
even though you had no idea
how you were going to win?

520
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,651
Story of my life.

521
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,088
I plan to make that my story, as well.

522
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,169
Just to be clear.

523
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,300
If your father gets us to
the throne of Lord Alcaman,

524
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:19,780
if there's a crown,

525
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:22,606
then I'll be taking it back
to King Zakkour in Al-Moraad.

526
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,448
You can have Norvania.

527
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,211
Do you plan to kill Drazen?

528
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,086
On my honor.

529
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,446
Then we have a deal.

530
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,660
That... It's riddles. It's riddles!

531
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,780
It's riddles!

532
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,606
I have deciphered the code!

533
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,140
At least the first part.

534
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,569
Excellent. Father,
let's pack for an adventure.

535
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,500
- I'll bring around the horses.
- An adventure!

536
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,371
An adventure! What shall I bring?

537
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,060
Let's go.

538
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:54,361
Well, you'll need this.

539
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,809
Mathayus of Akkad, Scorpion King,

540
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,043
you are guilty of the
murder of my father.

541
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,540
Murder?

542
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,887
Scorpion King?

543
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,971
It's a long story.

544
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,010
The kind your father doesn't believe in.

545
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,608
He's done it. He's cracked the code.

546
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,208
It leads to the village
of Glenrrossovia.

547
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,580
Sorrell Raskov,
you really are one smart man.

548
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,008
And you are a pig, Drazen.

549
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,100
Too bad none of your intelligence
was passed on to your daughter.

550
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,801
A pig who lives in a
castle is still a pig.

551
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,361
Oink, oink.

552
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:46,409
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

553
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,100
- Boris.
- Sire.

554
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,643
Keep this safe. Guard it with your life.

555
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,940
Sire.

556
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,500
That key can't turn
you into a king, Drazen.

557
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,370
And your father knew that.

558
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,282
Isn't that why you killed him?

559
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,521
Liar.

560
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,525
This man is an assassin and
he wanted my father's throne.

561
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,100
The only man who deserves that
throne is the man sitting next to me.

562
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,129
In the bird suit.

563
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,768
Who's probably smarter
than all of us combined.

564
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,660
Then he can be the smartest
man in the afterlife,

565
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:21,008
and you can be his loyal dog.

566
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,491
Burn it down.

567
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,940
The Scorpion King?
Legendary warrior from across the sands.

568
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:39,940
I thought you were a campfire story.

569
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,260
Sorry to disappoint you.

570
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,420
No!

571
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,801
- Well, did you kill Yannick?
- No. Drazen killed him.

572
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:49,580
Perhaps this is information you could
have shared before he caught up with us.

573
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:52,611
- I was afraid you wouldn't help.
- And you would have been right.

574
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:02,247
What are you doing?

575
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:03,620
I'm turning this on.

576
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:04,740
The chop-o-matic?

577
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,041
Yes.

578
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,725
The saw-o-matic.

579
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,300
Go!

580
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,060
Be careful!

581
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,620
To the right. Just a little more.

582
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,700
Yeah.

583
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,340
Wait! To the left.

584
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:18,060
- A little back. Back.
- Yes.

585
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,220
No, no, just a little more.
No, just to the left. No, just...

586
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,965
Back to the right.

587
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,606
That's good.

588
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,601
Wish me luck.

589
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:38,460
You know, Drazen doesn't
understand the clue.

590
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,125
He thinks it's the village. That's all.

591
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,570
But you withheld the exact location.
He'll never find it.

592
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,140
Let's go! Quickly!

593
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,249
- My father's designs.
- Too late.

594
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,610
We have to get there before Drazen.

595
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:56,940
Let's go. Quickly.

596
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:58,241
Oh.

597
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,571
I'm sorry.

598
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,603
All kneel in the presence of
King Drazen, ruler of Norvania!

599
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:29,002
Good people of Glenrrossovia,
now please, stand.

600
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:33,444
My father has been murdered.

601
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:37,527
His killer was a foreign assassin
known as the Scorpion King.

602
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,121
He was working with two other traitors,

603
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,842
Valina and Sorrell Raskov.

604
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:46,001
Before my men killed them this morning,

605
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,331
they gave up the secret to this village.

606
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,020
You there, come here.

607
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:54,900
- No. No, no, no.
- I'm okay.

608
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,900
Stay there. Stay there.

609
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,487
Will you be a loyal subject
and help your king?

610
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:00,860
Yes, My Lord.

611
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,740
Tell me where Alcaman's palace is.
I know it's here.

612
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,201
I don't know any...

613
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,780
Am I not making myself clear?

614
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,641
I know the palace is hidden in
this village, so take me there.

615
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,540
Look, it's the key.

616
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,020
You've done a good job protecting...

617
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,420
How do we get it?

618
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:22,100
We can't fight them. We're outnumbered.

619
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:26,007
Now prove yourself smart
and tell me where it is.

620
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,900
Please, I beg you. Don't kill me.

621
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,330
I'm not gonna kill you.
I have a job for you.

622
00:46:33,880 --> 00:46:35,060
And a gold coin if you get it done.

623
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,010
Show me where it is!

624
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:40,580
You! Something you wanna tell me?

625
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,405
No, no, no, no.

626
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,124
- Let me hear it?
- I don't know anything.

627
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,523
I promise you, My Lord.
I know nothing of any palace.

628
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,004
Feel free to stop me, anyone.

629
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,526
Before there's no secret
and no village left to save!

630
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:05,100
Whatever powers are held, they have...

631
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:08,404
They can be used to protect
you or destroy you.

632
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:12,930
Take our horses, water them and
have them ready when we call.

633
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,771
Do you understand?

634
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,288
...you are all as good as dead.

635
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,451
The temple of the Goddess.

636
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:28,380
The palace of Lord Alcaman
is under that fat lady?

637
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,540
Well, maybe not the palace,
but according to the riddles,

638
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,020
inside of the temple
is a slot for your key.

639
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:36,020
And it's not a fat lady.
It's a divine goddess.

640
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,060
Yup.

641
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:39,420
- Where are the other gods?
- What others?

642
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:42,020
You know, the God of the Sun,
the God of the Dead,

643
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:43,924
the God of War. The men.

644
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,180
We pray to one god in these parts,
and she is the only one we need.

645
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:49,606
Fine.

646
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:52,850
You can't go in there.
It's for women only.

647
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:57,766
Give me the key. I'll do it.

648
00:47:58,080 --> 00:47:59,281
Not a chance.

649
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,366
This is a holy place.

650
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,860
Any man enters the sanctuary,
the High Priestess

651
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,288
will sound the alarm and the
village will descend upon us.

652
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:10,007
Along with Drazen and his men.

653
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,085
You're still not getting the key.

654
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:14,921
Have it your way.

655
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:19,245
Hurry up, guys. Don't be shy.

656
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,420
You look lovely.

657
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,643
Are you sure Drazen didn't
leave you at the altar?

658
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,049
I find it quite comfortable.

659
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,642
I see why they don't
let the men in here.

660
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:08,740
I suddenly became religious.

661
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,120
I mean, oh, my, what a beautiful temple.

662
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:21,365
That's the inner sanctuary,
for those with extreme afflictions.

663
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,801
Who's that?

664
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,888
The High Priestess, Feminina.

665
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:29,605
And, no, she's not
hiding a keyhole either.

666
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,569
Look, the Divine Goddess
has a divine belly button.

667
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,363
- That does look like a keyhole.
- Yeah.

668
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:42,729
Welcome to the temple
of the Divine Goddess.

669
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,460
For what do you pray?

670
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:48,287
My sister is sick. She needs help.

671
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:52,967
You and your mother seem healthy, but...

672
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,380
She does not seem well.

673
00:49:57,480 --> 00:49:59,220
She's deathly ill.

674
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:03,340
The sickness has left her
deformed and hideous.

675
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,130
It's not that bad.

676
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,180
Oh, it's bad.

677
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,970
She'll need some special healing.

678
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,648
Very well, follow me.

679
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,121
My pleasure.

680
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,921
Dear sister. You poor, sick thing.

681
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,740
Too sick to even walk.

682
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,808
Repeat after me.

683
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:29,940
Divine Goddess,

684
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:33,847
our sister has been afflicted
with a hideous disease.

685
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:36,180
Divine Goddess,

686
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:40,420
our sister is afflicted
with a hideous disease.

687
00:50:40,520 --> 00:50:42,940
Use our bodies to heal her.

688
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,020
Touch her intimately through our mouths

689
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:49,210
and our bosoms and our wombs.

690
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:53,201
Use our bodies to heal her.

691
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:57,260
Touch her intimately through our mouths,

692
00:50:57,360 --> 00:51:01,121
our bosoms and our wombs.

693
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:04,220
You really don't sound well.

694
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:08,809
I'm not. I need to be
healed immediately.

695
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,420
Sister, lay your hands on me

696
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,883
that we might join our
bodies in intimate prayer.

697
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,045
I thought you'd never ask.

698
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:28,201
But we don't have time.

699
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,380
What's going on?

700
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,728
I'm suddenly feeling much better.

701
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,684
Oh, my.

702
00:51:39,360 --> 00:51:41,005
Calm down, sister.

703
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:45,860
What are you doing? Get away from her.

704
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:48,020
- Don't worry. It only hurts for a moment.
- That's obscene.

705
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,483
Divine Goddess, meet the
Golden Key of Lord Alcaman.

706
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,900
Maybe it's a different hole?

707
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:08,926
It has to be here.

708
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:18,924
Do I have to carve it out of you?

709
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,420
Take me to Alcaman's Palace!

710
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,009
That must be it. Bring the key.

711
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,681
Was that us?

712
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,980
What have we done?

713
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,321
What's happening?

714
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:49,180
Do you believe in magic now?

715
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,165
I must admit, we have stumbled
onto something quite unusual.

716
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,620
It's the Goddess.

717
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,809
She's transporting us to heaven.

718
00:52:56,920 --> 00:52:58,220
It's not the Goddess.

719
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,284
It's the power of Lord Alcaman.
The legend is real.

720
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,811
Why? Why are you doing this to us?

721
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:09,100
No! You fool. It's steam.

722
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,060
There must be a natural pocket
of steam underneath the temple,

723
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,660
and the key unlocked a vent.

724
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,620
God! It's brilliant.

725
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:17,140
That's what's lifting us?

726
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,126
He's harnessed the natural
power of thermal energy!

727
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:23,170
You know, hot water!

728
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,300
You're not supposed to be alive!

729
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:27,140
And you're not supposed to be king.

730
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,522
But we'll sort all this out
when I come back to kill you.

731
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:32,980
Smash it down.

732
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,620
I said, smash it down!

733
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,285
Go! Go!

734
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,860
The pillar.

735
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:39,571
Bring the pillar down!

736
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,168
Put your backs into it, come on!

737
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,969
Don't let them escape!

738
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,860
Why don't I see a palace here?

739
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:04,780
Or a throne? Or a crown? Or a...

740
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,491
What are you talking about?

741
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:07,900
I do.

742
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,201
Right there.

743
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,567
My big-boned friend, you're right.

744
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:14,900
That's the crown?

745
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:17,487
No, it's another clue. You see?

746
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,420
- Way out there?
- Yes.

747
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,900
Way, way, way out there.

748
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,980
What does it say?

749
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,100
"Silver, gold, silver, gold,

750
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,882
"step-by-step, the path unfolds."

751
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:31,526
Makes no sense.

752
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,580
But one thing is clear.

753
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:36,380
The man who is sending us
on this wild goose chase

754
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,648
is pointing us in that direction.

755
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,841
This thing's gonna fall.

756
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,260
We have to get out of here.

757
00:54:45,360 --> 00:54:47,050
How? How?

758
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:52,129
How dare you?

759
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,406
Can I borrow this?

760
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,844
Now I've got you.

761
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:32,130
This is why we don't allow men.

762
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:39,900
The boy should have our horses ready.

763
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,249
Yeah, if he hasn't stolen them by now.

764
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:47,380
There they are!

765
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:48,780
- Get them!
- Go back.

766
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,127
That's them! Move!

767
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:52,740
Go! Go! Go!

768
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,087
Psst! This way.

769
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:55,801
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

770
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:57,321
Now move!

771
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:03,881
This way!

772
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:06,644
There! After them!

773
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,300
To our horses.

774
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,886
Quick. Now.

775
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,444
You idiots!

776
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,007
I want more grog!

777
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:49,180
Why are we here again?

778
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:51,700
He's got to be around here somewhere.

779
00:56:51,800 --> 00:56:53,923
My, my, my.

780
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,220
Sugar love.

781
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:59,206
You said I'd see you on
the outside, and here you are.

782
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,320
Yes.

783
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,740
This is my father, Sorrell.

784
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:08,780
And you remember my other
friend from the castle, don't you?

785
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,260
Yeah, they're calling you
"the King Slayer."

786
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,420
Not that I mind, but it makes you

787
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:15,740
for a rather dangerous drinking buddy.

788
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:17,380
We need another map.

789
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,980
And, sugar love over here
said that you can get one for us.

790
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:22,380
Hey, sweetheart!

791
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:24,460
She knows how I do business.

792
00:57:24,560 --> 00:57:26,489
Payment up front.

793
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,100
Well, we may need to negotiate.

794
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,890
What do you have in mind?

795
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,260
I think it would be...

796
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:34,561
We're on a quest

797
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,020
for gold.

798
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,460
If you help us, provide us with a map

799
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:41,489
and your ax, if it gets dangerous,

800
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,721
then your cut will be one-quarter.

801
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,484
Let me see what I can do.

802
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,490
Sire.

803
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:54,244
We found their horses.

804
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:59,140
If the key is lost, you will
pay for it with your life.

805
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:01,540
Our scouts assure me, the fugitives

806
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:04,081
are not headed south toward Al-Moraad.

807
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,020
I know him.

808
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:08,060
He'll try and cross through the forest

809
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,020
and go for the throne
of Alcaman himself.

810
00:58:10,120 --> 00:58:13,300
Mathayus must have the key!

811
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:16,365
Maybe they've been able to
decipher the other markings on it.

812
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:51,689
Well, well, well, my friends.

813
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:54,500
Look what the rat has dragged in.

814
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,723
Gorak, it's been way too long.

815
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:01,650
Roland, you seek a
rare and special item.

816
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:05,580
A map that does not even exist.

817
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:07,500
Aye, it does not exist.

818
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:08,980
But if it did exist,

819
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,727
it'd be the only way to get past
the dragon who guards the forest.

820
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,380
And I brought gold.

821
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,603
Well, I love gold, my friend.

822
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:20,760
But this map is a one
of a kind, my friend.

823
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,300
How much do you want?

824
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,300
Gold only exists to satisfy the flesh.

825
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,380
That is the nature of
my business, my other friend.

826
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:32,580
What are you saying?

827
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:36,100
The girl fights for the map, my friend.

828
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:37,780
- Not gonna happen.
- No, no, no.

829
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,900
She's not fighting for the map.

830
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:39,980
Valina!

831
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,281
- I'll fight.
- No.

832
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,761
Call Chancara!

833
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,260
You don't have to do this.

834
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:59,164
We need that map.

835
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,043
Then kick her ass.

836
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:13,820
A special treat tonight, my friends!

837
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,884
A special fight tonight!

838
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:18,243
We have before us,

839
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,484
the challenger, Valina.

840
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:28,961
What do you fight for,
Valina, my friend?

841
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,220
A map.

842
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:36,060
And challenging Valina
is the lovely and sweet

843
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,300
Chancara!

844
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,606
What do you fight for,
Chancara, my friend?

845
01:00:45,680 --> 01:00:47,644
To kill Valina.

846
01:00:47,960 --> 01:00:49,620
Great.

847
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,924
You may begin, my friends.

848
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,806
Lovely to meet you.

849
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,803
- Valina!
- Kick her ass, sugar love!

850
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,806
Get up, Valina.

851
01:01:11,760 --> 01:01:13,166
Valina!

852
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:20,289
Come on, sugar love.

853
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:29,521
Valina!

854
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,721
No.

855
01:02:07,520 --> 01:02:08,767
Come on, Valina!

856
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,089
I might eat you after you're dead.

857
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:45,806
Come on, Valina.

858
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,124
How's that for an appetizer?

859
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:04,170
Perhaps you'd prefer the main course.

860
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,485
Thank you.

861
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:45,481
Awesome.

862
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,921
Yes.

863
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:59,164
You're a skilled fighter, my friend.

864
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:02,540
But you have damaged my
favorite wife and business.

865
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:06,640
For that, there will have
to be more gold, my friend.

866
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,160
I am not your friend.

867
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,620
It's the Tugarin Forest.

868
01:05:17,720 --> 01:05:20,048
There's a dragon that
guards these lands.

869
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,689
According to the map,
this is where we enter.

870
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:26,240
May the will of the great goddess
watch over us in our journey.

871
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,204
That, and the will of my sword.

872
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,888
Bend the trees. Don't break them.

873
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:36,043
What, are you afraid
of hurting a few trees?

874
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:38,562
No, I'm afraid of being tracked.

875
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:56,925
Do you hear something?

876
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,207
No, it's just a feeling.

877
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:05,567
There's something out there. Let's move.

878
01:06:27,080 --> 01:06:28,100
It's fresh.

879
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:30,380
They may be a half a day ahead of us.

880
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,648
This way, men. Onward.

881
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:39,740
Am I speaking in a foreign language?
I said, onward.

882
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:42,140
Sire, that's the Tugarin Forest.

883
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:44,500
We'll never get past the
great dragon, nor will Mathayus.

884
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,860
Then we'll die trying,
just like Mathayus.

885
01:06:47,960 --> 01:06:49,605
Now move!

886
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:57,260
Still feel something out there?
Dragon, perhaps?

887
01:06:57,360 --> 01:07:00,450
Dragon, Drazen, Gorak.

888
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:03,020
We've got a lot of
enemies to choose from.

889
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:04,765
Yeah, no kidding.

890
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,380
So?

891
01:07:07,480 --> 01:07:09,170
What?

892
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:11,331
The fight.

893
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:15,690
I've been preparing for
this for a long time.

894
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,660
My destiny.

895
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,121
I understand that.

896
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,245
So?

897
01:07:21,520 --> 01:07:22,860
What?

898
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:26,642
Why do they call you the Scorpion King?

899
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:31,003
Because I'm as charming
as a poisonous insect.

900
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:33,860
Honestly.

901
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:37,380
Well, if you can believe it, years ago,
I was on the run from another evil warlord,

902
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,540
who also wanted me dead.

903
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:42,730
Somehow, I can believe it.

904
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:47,210
There was a battle,

905
01:07:47,600 --> 01:07:52,220
and I was hit by an arrow that
was tipped with scorpion venom.

906
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:53,380
And I should have died,

907
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:58,288
but there was a sorceress
that brought me back to life.

908
01:07:58,560 --> 01:08:00,740
She told me that the
blood of the scorpion

909
01:08:00,840 --> 01:08:03,140
would forever flow through my veins.

910
01:08:03,240 --> 01:08:05,283
And for that, I owe her.

911
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:08,888
She was special to you.

912
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,580
Yes.

913
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:18,090
Cassandra became my wife, my queen.

914
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,050
And then she died.

915
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:24,886
Like everyone else that's close to me.

916
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,287
Guess you can say that's my destiny.

917
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,248
Destinies can change.

918
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,004
If you really want them to.

919
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:45,241
That's not a bird.

920
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:50,325
What is it?

921
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,780
Hello?

922
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,208
We're just travelers passing through.

923
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,247
We don't want any trouble.

924
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,841
Nothing.

925
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:25,220
We can take these guys.

926
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:38,660
Well, at least you can't
blame me for this one.

927
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,724
I'm sure I'll come up with something.

928
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:44,140
The tall guy must be their king.

929
01:09:44,240 --> 01:09:47,020
I serve King Zakkour of Al-Moraad.

930
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:49,380
You are a mighty king,
but you have made a mistake.

931
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:50,920
Yes.

932
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:54,700
We have gold, worthy
of a king such as yourself.

933
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:56,331
Yes.

934
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:03,844
Why are you speaking
to my little brother?

935
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:06,980
I am Chief Onus,

936
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,966
leader of the Tugarin tribe
and protector of this forest.

937
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,020
Praise the great spirit of this forest.

938
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,860
We give you the souls
of these trespassers

939
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:25,848
so that you may smile down
upon us with all your bounty!

940
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,500
What are they doing?

941
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,689
Preparing us for sacrifice.

942
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:36,060
To what?

943
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:37,850
I'm guessing whatever's in that box.

944
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:49,900
Father! I love you!

945
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,202
I love you, too, Valina.

946
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,129
They heard you.

947
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:03,682
All praise he who speaks to
the creatures of the forest.

948
01:12:04,120 --> 01:12:07,220
All praise!

949
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:10,380
All praise! All praise!

950
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,763
All praise!

951
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:19,300
Years ago, there was a king

952
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:22,900
who united all the nations
of the world under his reign,

953
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:25,248
because he conquered them all.

954
01:12:25,560 --> 01:12:28,020
On the top of that mountain lies a crown

955
01:12:28,120 --> 01:12:31,688
that guarantees the power
rest with me in Norvania.

956
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:35,980
I would gladly give
my life for Norvania.

957
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:38,940
And when the time comes,

958
01:12:39,040 --> 01:12:41,049
I expect you to do the same.

959
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:59,601
Yes, yes.

960
01:13:00,120 --> 01:13:01,420
So, you believe in magic now?

961
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:04,820
It's not magic. You've all
heard of the horse whisperer?

962
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:08,522
This is very similar. It's an
advanced form of communication.

963
01:13:08,680 --> 01:13:10,086
That's all.

964
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:25,380
Clearly, it's a tribal custom that
means they've accepted us.

965
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,681
Clearly.

966
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,900
Oh, no, no.

967
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:50,300
- Not me.
- Yes, yes, yes.

968
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,523
Do you really wanna offend our hosts?

969
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,610
Of course not.

970
01:14:23,280 --> 01:14:25,687
I knew you had it in you.

971
01:14:27,680 --> 01:14:29,166
We've looked over your map.

972
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:32,420
The only way to reach
this mountain's summit

973
01:14:32,520 --> 01:14:35,087
is to pass through the lair
of the Tugarin dragon.

974
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,860
I thought you were the Tugarin dragon.

975
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,580
We look like dragon?

976
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:42,300
We protect our forest
home from strangers.

977
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:45,500
The dragon protects the
mountain with equal passion.

978
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,980
But I assure you, he is very real.

979
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,620
Then I shall be meeting him soon.

980
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,740
You believe there is palace up there?

981
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:53,860
Palace full of witchcraft and wizardry?

982
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:57,642
Well, for all of our sakes,
we better hope so.

983
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:12,087
This is it, lair of the dragon.

984
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,260
You still don't believe?

985
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,700
In man's ability to fool himself? Yes.

986
01:15:16,800 --> 01:15:17,980
In dragons?

987
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:19,566
No.

988
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:21,820
Father, please.

989
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,724
Poo!

990
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,326
Whoo!

991
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:32,642
You see? Nothing.

992
01:15:36,120 --> 01:15:38,687
Hello, Mr. Dragon.

993
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:42,820
What's that?

994
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:45,300
It's just your imaginations gone wild.

995
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,491
There's no such thing as big,
old, scary dragons.

996
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,920
Oh, come on. You're trying to tell me...

997
01:16:02,480 --> 01:16:03,681
Run!

998
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:12,247
Run!

999
01:16:20,920 --> 01:16:22,420
Still think it's just a campfire story?

1000
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:26,122
Hell, no. I just got roasted
by a fire-breathing dragon.

1001
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:28,020
Any of you have ideas?

1002
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:29,220
What, how to kill a dragon?

1003
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:30,660
Yes.

1004
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,140
I have one.

1005
01:16:32,240 --> 01:16:33,930
What?

1006
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,340
Last chance to walk away.

1007
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:11,007
That's one skill I've never mastered.

1008
01:17:11,360 --> 01:17:13,380
You're not gonna splat me
against that wall, are you?

1009
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:17,605
Well, by my calculations, no.

1010
01:17:20,400 --> 01:17:24,127
Pardon me, Sir Dragon.
Could you please look this way?

1011
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,964
- Go.
- Wait for it.

1012
01:17:30,120 --> 01:17:32,004
Wait for it.

1013
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:33,606
Now!

1014
01:17:49,240 --> 01:17:50,930
Sorry!

1015
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,300
I forgot to carry the one.

1016
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:58,881
Go, go, go, go.

1017
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:07,340
They say, the second time's the charm.

1018
01:18:07,440 --> 01:18:08,980
Never heard that one.

1019
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:10,420
They say it.

1020
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:12,780
All right, big boy. Here comes dinner.

1021
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:14,605
You really have to put it that way?

1022
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:22,207
Now!

1023
01:18:31,440 --> 01:18:32,801
Yes!

1024
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,367
Mathayus! Be careful!

1025
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,260
Puncture the ocular cavity!

1026
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:52,700
That means "eye"!

1027
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,300
I think he knows what it...

1028
01:18:54,400 --> 01:18:55,601
The eye!

1029
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,220
Yes, yes.

1030
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,885
Yeah.

1031
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,890
You got him.

1032
01:19:24,360 --> 01:19:25,380
Are you okay?

1033
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:26,681
Yeah.

1034
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,500
It's amazing. Amazing!

1035
01:19:29,600 --> 01:19:32,565
It's a system of ropes and pulleys.

1036
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:35,500
It's powered by an underground stream.

1037
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:39,885
And those stones are scales,
which set the beast in motion.

1038
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:43,340
It's just another man-made illusion.

1039
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:44,820
I don't understand.

1040
01:19:44,920 --> 01:19:46,740
Why build a mechanical beast

1041
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:49,620
when you have all the magical
powers of Lord Alcaman?

1042
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,651
Well, my bushy friend,
I feel we are about to find out.

1043
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:21,020
This guy, Alcaman,
sure loves his surprises.

1044
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,820
All right, this is where
the stained glass pointed.

1045
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,125
This is nothing.
This is just a wall of rock.

1046
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:33,924
Maybe it's just an illusion,
another of Alcaman's tricks.

1047
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:35,820
Do you have any other riddles?

1048
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:37,531
Well.

1049
01:20:40,240 --> 01:20:43,020
"A man with honor shall wear it right,

1050
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,130
"the man without shall harvest ice."

1051
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:47,980
Wait, here's one.

1052
01:20:48,080 --> 01:20:51,180
"The key to success is rooted in stone."

1053
01:20:51,280 --> 01:20:54,962
There's certainly a lot of stone here.

1054
01:20:56,360 --> 01:20:57,780
Yes.

1055
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,651
But there's only one thing rooted in it.

1056
01:21:58,200 --> 01:21:59,765
Anybody home?

1057
01:22:01,680 --> 01:22:05,566
It's real. I don't believe it.
It's real.

1058
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,925
There it is.

1059
01:22:23,240 --> 01:22:25,681
The lost throne of Lord Alcaman.

1060
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,929
Looks like your campfire
story came true.

1061
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,340
There's only one thing missing.

1062
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:32,540
Yes, what's that?

1063
01:22:32,640 --> 01:22:34,410
The crown.

1064
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:36,060
The crown?

1065
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,407
I'm guessing it's in there.

1066
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:39,860
Finally, he made one thing easy to find.

1067
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,500
Too bad it won't be yours.

1068
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:43,325
What are you doing?

1069
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:46,844
One step closer, and I'll kill her.

1070
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:48,606
I'm trading up.

1071
01:22:49,840 --> 01:22:51,540
Roland, are you insane?

1072
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,660
You're outnumbered.

1073
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:53,780
Oh, yeah?

1074
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,580
Let me introduce you to my friends.

1075
01:22:55,680 --> 01:22:56,620
Hide.

1076
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:57,860
Get away from me.

1077
01:22:57,960 --> 01:22:59,060
Wait.

1078
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:00,900
I believe you've already met my friends.

1079
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,363
Give me some sugar, love.

1080
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,620
You lead them here the whole time.

1081
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,922
And you lead me to the lost throne.

1082
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,811
Seize her!

1083
01:23:36,120 --> 01:23:37,685
Mathayus.

1084
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,380
My, my, my.

1085
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:43,729
Look at this.

1086
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:48,643
You may think you're the
better warrior, Mathayus.

1087
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:51,722
But I'm gonna be the better king.

1088
01:23:52,280 --> 01:23:56,485
In fact, I'm gonna be
the king of all kings.

1089
01:24:19,240 --> 01:24:21,568
By the power of Alcaman!

1090
01:24:42,400 --> 01:24:44,380
This is going to be fun.

1091
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,206
Mathayus, I owe you a great deal.

1092
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,580
In fact, I will mark your
grave with a word of thanks.

1093
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:11,180
You fool!

1094
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:14,140
It's not magic. It's science!

1095
01:25:14,240 --> 01:25:16,408
It's just another trick. It's a...

1096
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:19,260
It's the room.

1097
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,500
Those coats are magnetic attraction.

1098
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,340
And the floor is magnetic repulsion.

1099
01:25:25,440 --> 01:25:27,449
You saw in my workshop.

1100
01:25:31,200 --> 01:25:32,561
Father!

1101
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:50,727
All of you, stand down!

1102
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:52,731
Leave him to me.

1103
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:05,166
No, no. No, you're okay. You're okay.

1104
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,206
Mathayus!

1105
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,810
What's the matter, Scorpion King?

1106
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,123
No match for the jacket?

1107
01:26:32,280 --> 01:26:33,891
This way.

1108
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:45,367
No!

1109
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,251
Come on! Get over here!

1110
01:27:00,200 --> 01:27:03,165
You could have shared all this with me.

1111
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:07,884
Now the crown and everything
else will be mine.

1112
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:17,500
And my wench of a fiancée
will finally be dead.

1113
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:25,481
Boo.

1114
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:50,689
Don't call Valina a wench.

1115
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:06,420
Get back, get back, get back. Move it.

1116
01:28:06,520 --> 01:28:08,688
Stay back. It's opening.

1117
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:19,727
Look at me. I'm rich! Rich! Rich!

1118
01:28:24,720 --> 01:28:27,241
Go! Help him.

1119
01:28:33,880 --> 01:28:37,527
"Rooster tails have a bitter end."

1120
01:28:42,720 --> 01:28:43,940
It's another trick.

1121
01:28:44,040 --> 01:28:47,580
That's all there is,
Mathayus, is tricks.

1122
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,281
There's illusions, and there's science.

1123
01:28:52,080 --> 01:28:53,820
"Rooster tails have a bitter end.

1124
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:56,660
"Seek what's missing
through me, my friend."

1125
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,644
Wait, say that second half again.

1126
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,249
"Seek what's missing
through me, my friend."

1127
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:12,761
Through me?

1128
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:18,140
Only the crown can save him now.

1129
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,442
Time to make magic.

1130
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,300
Stay with us.

1131
01:29:25,400 --> 01:29:26,647
Wish me luck.

1132
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,284
Come on, sire. Get up.

1133
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:50,842
Bring some rope, Boris.

1134
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,683
Come on, quickly.

1135
01:30:08,760 --> 01:30:12,009
I'm coming for you, Mathayus!

1136
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:50,900
Valina.

1137
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,281
Yes.

1138
01:30:52,720 --> 01:30:54,900
This man, Mathayus...

1139
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,089
Father, he's not...

1140
01:30:59,760 --> 01:31:01,928
He has a good heart.

1141
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:09,611
"Silver and gold, step-by-step,
the path unfolds.

1142
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:13,687
"Silver and gold."

1143
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,689
Okay, men! This way!

1144
01:31:57,520 --> 01:31:59,848
I hate to leave you, Valina.

1145
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:02,860
Don't say that, Father.

1146
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:05,606
Mathayus will find the crown.

1147
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:08,687
My sweet, silly little girl.

1148
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:12,491
There's no such thing as magic.

1149
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,128
Hurry up! Come on.

1150
01:32:28,280 --> 01:32:32,121
Boris, you are my most trusted commander.
Step forward.

1151
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,161
Sire.

1152
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:50,540
Lisgar.

1153
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:52,900
You are now my most trusted commander.

1154
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,680
Sire, I'm more of a follower.

1155
01:33:58,880 --> 01:34:00,923
That crown is mine!

1156
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:06,566
Valina.

1157
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,725
You must hurry, Mathayus!

1158
01:34:33,160 --> 01:34:34,805
It's over, partner.

1159
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:37,100
The power is finally mine.

1160
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:41,962
I was born to be a king,
and now I will live like a god.

1161
01:34:52,480 --> 01:34:53,727
What's happening?

1162
01:34:57,080 --> 01:34:58,220
What's happening?

1163
01:34:58,320 --> 01:35:01,820
"The man with honor shall wear it right,

1164
01:35:01,920 --> 01:35:05,488
"the man without shall harvest ice."

1165
01:35:07,240 --> 01:35:10,046
You can't wear the crown, Drazen.

1166
01:35:10,840 --> 01:35:12,769
You're not honorable.

1167
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,806
But you are cold as ice.

1168
01:35:23,760 --> 01:35:28,170
Takes more than a sword
and a crown to be king.

1169
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:13,760
Valina.

1170
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,420
Quickly.

1171
01:36:19,520 --> 01:36:21,609
It's too late. He's dead.

1172
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,820
If only he could have seen it,
he would've finally believed it.

1173
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:26,804
Maybe we can still convince him.

1174
01:36:42,200 --> 01:36:43,845
Father?

1175
01:36:44,560 --> 01:36:45,841
Father.

1176
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,409
What have you done?

1177
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:50,940
I've proven you wrong, old man.

1178
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,340
No, it can't be.

1179
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,722
It can be. You know why?

1180
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:56,960
Because it's magic.

1181
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:03,840
You look pretty good in that thing.

1182
01:37:07,080 --> 01:37:08,566
It's real.

1183
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,800
And Lord Alcaman knew it was too
powerful to fall into the wrong hands.

1184
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,444
Into anyone's hands.

1185
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:46,860
You're too late.

1186
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:49,561
The battle's over. Drazen is dead.

1187
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:53,323
What about the crown?
The power of Lord Alcaman?

1188
01:37:53,680 --> 01:37:56,700
Turns out, it was just a campfire story.

1189
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,860
Smoke and mirrors.

1190
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:00,605
A myth.

1191
01:38:15,360 --> 01:38:19,860
By the power entrusted to me by
the people and laws of the kingdom,

1192
01:38:19,960 --> 01:38:24,220
I crown you King Sorrell of Norvania.

1193
01:38:38,320 --> 01:38:41,020
My daughter speaks to me of a destiny,

1194
01:38:41,120 --> 01:38:43,780
and she's taught me to believe in it.

1195
01:38:43,880 --> 01:38:47,971
Now I take this opportunity
to help destiny unfold.

1196
01:38:53,720 --> 01:38:57,100
I crown you Queen Valina of Norvania.

1197
01:39:02,360 --> 01:39:04,449
It is her destiny.

1198
01:39:11,640 --> 01:39:13,260
And I pledge to build a nation

1199
01:39:13,360 --> 01:39:16,740
based upon the principles
of science and mathematics,

1200
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:19,420
of truth and reason,

1201
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,930
and just a little bit of magic.

1202
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:18,780
King Zakkour, as my
daughter is new at this,

1203
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,900
it might be helpful to have a more
experienced statesman in her court.

1204
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:24,460
You know, someone dependable, honorable.

1205
01:41:24,560 --> 01:41:26,444
Someone who works well with others.

1206
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:29,851
Well, I am sworn to Al-Moraad.

1207
01:41:30,080 --> 01:41:31,580
You kept your oath,

1208
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:34,724
but you are free to stay with
the Queen, in her service.

1209
01:41:35,120 --> 01:41:37,402
The Queen demands it.

1210
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,580
Long live Norvania!

1211
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,609
Norvania!

1212
01:41:55,760 --> 01:41:57,860
I am definitely picking my own uniform.

1213
01:41:57,960 --> 01:41:59,207
Good idea.

1214
01:42:00,360 --> 01:42:01,900
What? This isn't a dress.

1215
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:02,980
Whatever you say.

1216
01:42:03,080 --> 01:42:04,260
Of course not.

1217
01:42:04,360 --> 01:42:06,562
Looks like a dress to me.

1218
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,320
Looks good on him.

1219
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,209
Speaking of dresses.

1220
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:16,524
Heathen.

1220
01:42:17,305 --> 01:43:17,358
