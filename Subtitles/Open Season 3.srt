00:00:29,447 --> 00:00:30,485
Woo hoo!

5
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:32,392
One day to guys trip.

6
00:00:43,363 --> 00:00:44,241
Hey Boog!

7
00:00:44,365 --> 00:00:47,439
When are you gonna bring your fine self
down here to fix up our habitat, huh?

8
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:51,249
Just as soon as I finish
helping Riley with the dam.

9
00:00:57,415 --> 00:00:58,293
There we go.

10
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:00,523
You all set for tomorrow?
It's gonna be awesome!

11
00:01:00,618 --> 00:01:01,496
Sorry Boog!

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,295
I gotta build this dam.

13
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,301
No guys trip for me.

14
00:01:05,424 --> 00:01:08,302
What? No guys trip?
No guys trip?

15
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:09,499
Have you lost your mind?

16
00:01:09,629 --> 00:01:12,533
I gotta finish this or
O'Grady will tear my eye.

17
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:15,370
Yeah. That's okay, it's cool.

18
00:01:15,503 --> 00:01:18,441
We'll think about you while
we're making this and talking trash.

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,413
I'm not sure that you can fit in there,
jerky!

20
00:01:21,542 --> 00:01:23,444
Hey, I don't know,
maybe the whole batch?

21
00:01:24,513 --> 00:01:25,483
Alright you troops!

22
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:27,527
- Let them fly!
- Oi!

23
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,505
Hey, you need anything else,
just let me know.

24
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,372
We gotta get on the road
bright and early tomorrow, baby.

25
00:01:39,498 --> 00:01:41,275
Uh, about that, Boog.

26
00:01:41,366 --> 00:01:42,370
I've got a wee problem.

27
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:45,280
With all the new kids,
I'm not done collecting my nuts.

28
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,476
Believe me, lad.

29
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,417
I'd rather be skittling with you.

30
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,514
Than getting my minds
with these boffin goons.

31
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:53,425
Yeah, right.

32
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,329
- Ant! Guys' trip?
- No can't do, bugger!

33
00:01:57,585 --> 00:02:00,261
I got too many. Responsibilities.

34
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:01,290
No problem.

35
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:03,301
- Birdie?
- Sorry Boog.

36
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,270
Great.

37
00:02:04,527 --> 00:02:06,464
Surfs, Danny? Let me guess.

38
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:11,313
Uh. We cannot go suddenly.

39
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:12,440
That's what I thought.

40
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,442
That's okay.
At least I've got Elliot.

41
00:02:16,542 --> 00:02:17,477
He won't let me down.

42
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,353
It'll be like old times.

43
00:02:19,446 --> 00:02:20,324
Me and he.

44
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:21,417
The original partners.

45
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,493
Sshh. Quiet.

46
00:02:29,624 --> 00:02:31,401
Koo! Koo-koo!

47
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,409
Giselllal Gesalital I was just
looking for your dad.

48
00:02:39,503 --> 00:02:40,507
Rabbit fight, huh?

49
00:02:40,604 --> 00:02:42,313
Yeah, count me in.

50
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,443
Where's your little bro?

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,381
You'll never find me here.

52
00:03:07,568 --> 00:03:09,345
Alright, let's see.

53
00:03:09,438 --> 00:03:10,373
Where to hide?

54
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:12,509
Ahhh "X" marks the spot!

55
00:03:20,552 --> 00:03:21,487
- Got you!
- Gotcha!

56
00:03:21,621 --> 00:03:22,499
You're out!

57
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:25,460
You gotta work on the landing.

58
00:03:26,526 --> 00:03:27,530
Great game, dad.

59
00:03:27,627 --> 00:03:29,507
Yeah, great game, you guys.
That was awesome.

60
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,305
Alright, when your mother asks.

61
00:03:31,398 --> 00:03:33,437
You'll say I lost for protecting you
from a wild boar.

62
00:03:35,503 --> 00:03:36,507
And a sidekick ferret.

63
00:03:38,474 --> 00:03:39,512
Mom's gonna kill you.

64
00:03:39,608 --> 00:03:41,545
I was attacked by a ferret.

65
00:03:41,677 --> 00:03:43,386
- No, you weren't.
- Dad.

66
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:45,325
Stop telling Elvis to lie.

67
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:47,485
Mom says you're not supposed to do that.

68
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,293
That wasn't a lie?

69
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:50,321
It was uh.

70
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:51,424
It was a reverse!

71
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:55,393
A stretch of a non-actual. Boog.
Buddy, back me up here.

72
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,498
Just tell the truth. It's the only way
to roll.

73
00:03:57,629 --> 00:04:00,271
Exactly what I was saying.

74
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,267
And stay in school.

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,301
And don't talk to strangers.

76
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:03,312
And never run with scissors.

77
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,407
So Boogster, you wanna take
the kids fishing?

78
00:04:05,505 --> 00:04:06,475
Actually, Elliot.

79
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:09,419
- I'm kinda getting ready for guys'.
- I see where you're going with this.

80
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:11,447
It's time to teach survival skills.

81
00:04:11,545 --> 00:04:13,391
- I was hoping to.
- Grab a baseball.

82
00:04:13,515 --> 00:04:14,553
- Well I..
- Acupuncture? Origami?

83
00:04:14,683 --> 00:04:16,460
- Elliot. Elliot.
- Yoga? Sumo wrestling?

84
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:18,488
- Elliot!
- Pods. What happened to pods, right?

85
00:04:18,587 --> 00:04:20,558
I tell you what. Just take them.
Do whatever you want.

86
00:04:20,656 --> 00:04:22,433
I'm trying to get ready for guys' trip!

87
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,395
So are you definitely going?

88
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,343
- How could I miss it?
- Yeah, I knew I could count on you.

89
00:04:29,634 --> 00:04:32,538
Remember to tell Boog
that you can't go on guys' trip.

90
00:04:32,638 --> 00:04:35,382
I meant to say I have to
babysit the kids.

91
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:38,287
'Cos Giselle's going to see her mother.

92
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,289
That's okay, E.

93
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,318
Don't sweat it.

94
00:04:43,418 --> 00:04:45,298
You've got family obligations.

95
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:47,300
And sometimes, you've got to cancel.

96
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:48,301
Sometimes?

97
00:04:48,424 --> 00:04:49,394
Don't you mean always?

98
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:51,302
How long have you known about this?

99
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:53,273
- Two weeks?
- Two weeks?

100
00:04:53,395 --> 00:04:54,433
Oh, just forget it.

101
00:04:54,564 --> 00:04:56,535
- I don't know why I even bother.
- Boog!

102
00:04:58,435 --> 00:04:59,439
Oh, he'll get over it.

103
00:04:59,537 --> 00:05:01,417
Just like he did when I
canceled the fishing trip.

104
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:04,315
I guess rabbit fight's over.

105
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:05,387
Pretty much.

106
00:05:12,652 --> 00:05:14,532
Mother! I was attacked by a ferret!

107
00:05:14,654 --> 00:05:18,400
I guess me and Elliot. We weren't
as tight as I thought we were.

108
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:19,537
Oh hey.

109
00:05:20,495 --> 00:05:22,375
You're not gonna cancel
on me too, are you?

110
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:24,536
'Cos bears gotta stick together.

111
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,281
You know what I like about you,
dinkleman?

112
00:05:28,404 --> 00:05:30,375
You're always there when I need you.

113
00:05:30,573 --> 00:05:31,508
And don't worry.

114
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,520
We're gonna have a blast tomorrow.

115
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:36,517
This will be the best guys' trip, ever.

116
00:05:36,647 --> 00:05:37,525
You'll see!

117
00:05:39,417 --> 00:05:40,295
Elliot.

118
00:05:40,551 --> 00:05:41,555
Three meals a day.

119
00:05:41,653 --> 00:05:44,432
And everyone in bed by sunset.

120
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:45,433
I know.

121
00:05:45,558 --> 00:05:47,529
And make sure to apologise to Boog when
he gets back.

122
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:49,574
- Okay.
- For what?

123
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:52,568
For some things you said yesterday.

124
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,377
And for some things you forgot to say
two weeks ago?

125
00:05:56,571 --> 00:05:57,549
Kids.

126
00:05:58,474 --> 00:05:59,444
Keep an eye on your dad.

127
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:02,322
- Bye mom!
- We love you!

128
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,517
- Safe journey!
- Have fun!

129
00:06:03,647 --> 00:06:05,584
Have fun with the old dadillacs.

130
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,561
What was that, Elliot?

131
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,397
I love you.

132
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:12,426
- Say hi to your mother for me.
- I will.

133
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:14,529
What are we gonna do first, hm? Father?

134
00:06:15,528 --> 00:06:16,532
Don't worry, kids.

135
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:19,305
I've got a tons of things planned.

136
00:06:19,465 --> 00:06:20,343
Right.

137
00:06:20,466 --> 00:06:21,538
When does uncle Boog get back, again?

138
00:06:31,612 --> 00:06:32,547
it's gonna be fun!

139
00:06:38,621 --> 00:06:42,526
Then he realised, that his best one horn
friend in the world had abandoned him.

140
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:44,334
And worse than that?

141
00:06:44,562 --> 00:06:46,499
All that was left on his hand was.

142
00:06:47,431 --> 00:06:48,309
A hook!

143
00:06:57,677 --> 00:06:59,318
This is very fun.

144
00:07:00,581 --> 00:07:02,518
Well, I guess it could be worse.

145
00:07:18,569 --> 00:07:20,278
Who am I kidding?

146
00:07:20,405 --> 00:07:22,285
This whole thing was a bad idea.

147
00:07:22,407 --> 00:07:24,480
It's not a guys' trip with only one guy?

148
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:28,517
I mean. It's not like I changed?

149
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:30,426
He's the one who changed.

150
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,432
He's the one who flakes all the time.

151
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,432
But he has a family.

152
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:38,403
You have to be more understanding.

153
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:39,470
Yeah.

154
00:07:39,661 --> 00:07:41,336
Understanding my butt!

155
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:44,469
You're better off without that under
privileged broken horn plank, cancel it.

156
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:46,538
But you guys are partners.

157
00:07:47,436 --> 00:07:48,314
Partners?

158
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,341
Who cares, baby?

159
00:07:51,474 --> 00:07:53,376
That deer ain't got nothing on us.

160
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,390
Yeah! You know, you're right!

161
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,331
You know, what would be great to eat
just about now?

162
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,330
Another woo-hoo bar.

163
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,360
And I know just the place to get it.

164
00:08:11,565 --> 00:08:12,443
Beautiful.

165
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:17,316
Now all we need are the balloons and
you'll be ready to go!

166
00:08:19,576 --> 00:08:21,319
Don't worry, baby.

167
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:25,349
I'll never let anything happen to you,
ever again.

168
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:36,432
Hello. Ladies!

169
00:08:36,562 --> 00:08:39,375
Don't you all love my finest evening?

170
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:41,445
Hooty-O's?

171
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,378
Hoo- Hoo.

172
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:44,405
Coco Ding bats.

173
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:46,384
My favourite!

174
00:08:47,475 --> 00:08:49,412
Honey? Now that's more like it.

175
00:08:52,515 --> 00:08:53,450
There you go, buddy.

176
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:54,527
Don't worry.

177
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,359
Nobody's driving.

178
00:08:56,486 --> 00:08:57,421
Hey, rabbit!

179
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,594
You ain't leaving 'til you eat those
Coco Dingbats.

180
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:02,502
This is the best guys' trip ever!

181
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:05,507
Me and Dinkleman agree with you
one hundred percent!

182
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,601
Rabbit loves Dinkleman.

183
00:09:07,698 --> 00:09:10,340
Dinkleman loves rabbit.

184
00:09:10,469 --> 00:09:11,404
Was what that, Dink?

185
00:09:11,503 --> 00:09:13,508
Can't go on guys' trip because
I'm married?

186
00:09:19,446 --> 00:09:21,485
No deer on guys' trip.

187
00:09:21,582 --> 00:09:24,554
Bla bla bla guys' trip.

188
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:27,600
Dink?

189
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:30,504
We gotta go somewhere
where folks don't let us down.

190
00:09:31,562 --> 00:09:32,566
Place where we fit in.

191
00:09:33,496 --> 00:09:34,500
A real home.

192
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:43,442
A place like that.

193
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:46,389
With other bears who totally get us.

194
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,547
If only we knew what that was.

195
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,555
Wait a minute.

196
00:10:00,629 --> 00:10:02,509
A place where no one lets you down.

197
00:10:03,599 --> 00:10:05,342
You stay here, rabbit.

198
00:10:05,435 --> 00:10:06,507
Keep your eye on the stash.

199
00:10:38,608 --> 00:10:39,586
Doug.

200
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,489
Why do you always let me down?

201
00:10:41,578 --> 00:10:43,549
Circus in two days.

202
00:10:43,681 --> 00:10:46,528
You could at least pretend to care.

203
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:49,361
Oh, was I supposed to catch you?

204
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,508
How classy.

205
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,638
Rehearsals over!

206
00:11:03,471 --> 00:11:04,509
I'm telling you, Alistair.

207
00:11:04,605 --> 00:11:07,577
One of these days, I'm gonna give
that diva a piece of my mind.

208
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:09,418
I'm sure you will.

209
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:11,391
I mean. Back where I came from.

210
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,360
I know. The zoo.

211
00:11:13,449 --> 00:11:14,521
No.. No.. No...

212
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:15,620
For the last time.

213
00:11:15,718 --> 00:11:17,495
It's the Wild Animal Park.

214
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:18,558
There's a difference, you know?

215
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:19,567
Anyway.

216
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:22,366
When I was in the Wild Animal Park.

217
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:23,497
No one treated me like that.

218
00:11:23,627 --> 00:11:25,438
All the animals worshiped me.

219
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,568
There was one grizzly.

220
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:28,407
One king of the jungle.

221
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:29,512
Me.

222
00:11:29,535 --> 00:11:31,415
Oh... See....

223
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:32,541
Just as soon as we get out of here.

224
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:35,450
We're gonna find a place just like that.

225
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,613
And I won't forget your help.

226
00:11:36,710 --> 00:11:38,419
I'll be king.

227
00:11:38,512 --> 00:11:40,551
And you'll be.

228
00:11:40,647 --> 00:11:42,493
Well, we'll find something
for you to be.

229
00:11:42,617 --> 00:11:44,519
- Oh?
- OK, here's the plan.

230
00:11:44,619 --> 00:11:45,589
You lift the cart.

231
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:47,464
And we'd both squeezed through.

232
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:48,434
Go on.

233
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:49,458
Give it a try.

234
00:11:49,591 --> 00:11:51,437
You want me to pull something?

235
00:11:51,562 --> 00:11:53,635
Have I ever done you wrong before?

236
00:12:07,481 --> 00:12:09,486
You promise to take me with you?

237
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:10,551
Of course I will.

238
00:12:10,651 --> 00:12:12,531
- You're the Yin to my.
- Yang.

239
00:12:12,654 --> 00:12:13,532
What? No!

240
00:12:13,655 --> 00:12:15,501
What kind of word is Yang?

241
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,525
I was thinking more like.

242
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:18,595
You're the 'Yin' to help me get 'Yout'!

243
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,573
Now let's hurry up
before someone sees us.

244
00:12:22,598 --> 00:12:23,476
Come on.

245
00:12:23,599 --> 00:12:24,603
What are you waiting for?

246
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,549
A little help?

247
00:12:35,646 --> 00:12:36,524
Please?

248
00:12:36,648 --> 00:12:38,528
Now you're supervising, that's good.

249
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:40,588
You want something done?

250
00:12:40,687 --> 00:12:42,396
You gotta do it yourself.

251
00:12:44,624 --> 00:12:45,502
Too heavy!

252
00:12:45,759 --> 00:12:47,602
Doug!

253
00:12:47,595 --> 00:12:49,532
Ssshh. Someone will hear you.

254
00:12:51,665 --> 00:12:52,543
Yeah, I know.

255
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:54,375
We need another set of arms.

256
00:12:55,704 --> 00:12:57,413
Hey, I'm upset too.

257
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:58,544
You can't take this on personal?

258
00:12:58,674 --> 00:13:00,417
We all have our limitations?

259
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:01,521
Oh, hey!

260
00:13:01,644 --> 00:13:03,490
That wheel's on your hoof.

261
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,550
Doesn't that hurt?

262
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,523
Now where were we?

263
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:09,632
Oh yeah.

264
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,498
We need another set of arms.

265
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,594
Question is.

266
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:13,661
Where to find it?

267
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,374
Protect me!

268
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:20,545
What in the world?

269
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:34,424
Ho! Another grizzly in the flesh!

270
00:13:34,551 --> 00:13:37,523
You don't know how long
I've waited for this day.

271
00:13:38,522 --> 00:13:40,629
Yo, you got some kind of thing
coming out of your neck.

272
00:13:40,759 --> 00:13:42,605
I know. It's called Alistair.

273
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,641
Hola! Comme es ta?

274
00:13:45,664 --> 00:13:46,634
What do you want, bear?

275
00:13:46,731 --> 00:13:48,406
The name's, Boog.

276
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:50,471
Man! Another grizzly?

277
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,608
This will be so great!

278
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:53,641
We'll go fishing, have rabbit fights.

279
00:13:53,774 --> 00:13:55,381
Be best friends!

280
00:14:02,684 --> 00:14:04,393
She's here too?

281
00:14:04,486 --> 00:14:06,423
Hold up. Are you talking about Ursa?

282
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:08,435
She's difficult to catch.

283
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,605
Bear-vana? Listen Boog.

284
00:14:11,728 --> 00:14:14,507
We're busy here. Go back
to where you came from, okay?

285
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,569
Back where I came from?

286
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:17,579
Back there.

287
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:18,638
I'm the only bear.

288
00:14:18,771 --> 00:14:21,447
- The only bear?
- Yeah.

289
00:14:21,573 --> 00:14:23,384
- All the other animals? They...
- Worship you?

290
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,545
What?

291
00:14:24,544 --> 00:14:26,424
Oh yeah, that sounds fantastic.

292
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:27,391
Didn't you hear me?

293
00:14:27,515 --> 00:14:28,689
I said I'm the only bear.

294
00:14:28,782 --> 00:14:31,526
You must be so lonely.

295
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:34,500
The only lonely bear.

296
00:14:35,524 --> 00:14:36,459
That's very sad.

297
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:38,471
I promise I wouldn't do this but.

298
00:14:44,768 --> 00:14:47,615
Right. Right. Sounds terrible.

299
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:49,584
- I'm fighting this one.
- Give me just a second.

300
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:51,545
What are you doing?

301
00:14:51,676 --> 00:14:53,453
Don't you see this is our chance?

302
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:55,686
We get the bear to help us move the
carts and we're out of here!

303
00:14:55,781 --> 00:14:58,423
But the circus will miss us!

304
00:14:58,551 --> 00:15:00,431
They'll send a search party!

305
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,398
You're right.

306
00:15:01,721 --> 00:15:02,599
I'll go.

307
00:15:03,523 --> 00:15:05,425
- But you. But you.
- Trust me.

308
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:06,530
I got it all figured out.

309
00:15:07,562 --> 00:15:08,497
Listen, Boog.

310
00:15:08,629 --> 00:15:11,476
You and me? We're gonna do
all those things you talked about.

311
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:13,501
Fishing, camping.

312
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:14,606
- Oh, and rabbit fights?
- Sure!

313
00:15:14,703 --> 00:15:16,549
Girls, rabbits, whatever you want.

314
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:18,483
So here's what I'm gonna do for you!

315
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:21,579
I'm gonna find a place where we can
all be best friends together.

316
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:22,589
Really?

317
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,422
You'd do that for me?

318
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:26,426
In a bear-minute.

319
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,624
We're grizzlies.
Gotta look out for each other.

320
00:15:29,653 --> 00:15:30,588
So, here's the thing.

321
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,604
We gotta swap places so the circus
doesn't know I'm gone.

322
00:15:33,726 --> 00:15:35,537
But I come back tomorrow night.

323
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:36,667
And you, me and Ursa.

324
00:15:36,763 --> 00:15:38,540
- We go on a kind of..
- Bears' trip?

325
00:15:39,667 --> 00:15:40,545
Yeah, sure.

326
00:15:41,536 --> 00:15:42,414
Bears' trip.

327
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,548
Together.

328
00:15:43,672 --> 00:15:45,483
Alright! I'm in.

329
00:15:45,608 --> 00:15:46,486
Great.

330
00:15:46,608 --> 00:15:48,488
Now hold still for just a second.

331
00:15:49,745 --> 00:15:51,625
Keep it down and stop moving

332
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,428
Oh yeah.

333
00:15:54,551 --> 00:15:55,452
This is gonna work!

334
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,429
Now what about me?

335
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:58,560
Hey, like you said.

336
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,536
If they figure out you're missing,
they'll send a search party.

337
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:05,440
Don't worry. I'll bring someone back
tomorrow night to swap with you.

338
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:10,477
When I say three, lift as hard as you
can.

339
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,481
Got it?

340
00:16:11,604 --> 00:16:12,482
Got it.

341
00:16:12,606 --> 00:16:14,679
One, two, three.

342
00:16:22,718 --> 00:16:26,464
You'd better hide that doll
so nobody gets suspicious.

343
00:16:26,556 --> 00:16:27,628
- What doll?
- That one.

344
00:16:28,524 --> 00:16:29,402
In your hand.

345
00:16:29,525 --> 00:16:30,495
You mean Dinkleman?

346
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:31,598
He ain't no doll!

347
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:33,436
He's my bro!

348
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:34,442
My boy!

349
00:16:34,566 --> 00:16:35,467
My Blouse

350
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:36,502
Right.

351
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:41,640
Hey, so where's that all for only bear
place you were talking about?

352
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:44,586
You know, just so I make sure
I stay away from it.

353
00:16:44,711 --> 00:16:47,615
Over the mountain, pass forest
and down by the stream.

354
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,526
Cool! Thanks!

355
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,561
See you tomorrow night!

356
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:01,440
When can I meet Ursa?

357
00:17:03,534 --> 00:17:05,414
Perhaps it's better to do that
in the morning.

358
00:17:05,536 --> 00:17:06,506
When you're a little more.

359
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:07,574
Awake. No?

360
00:17:08,707 --> 00:17:10,587
I don't know why I'm so tired.

361
00:17:10,675 --> 00:17:12,418
Oh.. Si...

362
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:13,651
Could it be the chocolates?

363
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:16,422
So, what are you?

364
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:19,453
- Some kind of Iama?
- I'm an Argentinian Carnelian.

365
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:21,625
What's an Argentinian Carnelian?

366
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,465
It's a kind of lama.

367
00:17:24,726 --> 00:17:25,604
Nice digs.

368
00:17:26,561 --> 00:17:27,565
I just want you to know.

369
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:30,539
That it is very sympathetic.

370
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,603
That you came all this way.

371
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,706
Just to meet another grizzly.

372
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:53,704
Oh, Mr. Weenie, mommy's going
to miss you so much.

373
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:56,641
I promised myself I wouldn't cry.

374
00:17:58,532 --> 00:17:59,410
Now remember.

375
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:00,606
Play nice with everybody.

376
00:18:02,637 --> 00:18:03,641
Ready for your third dinner?

377
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:13,594
Yumm.

378
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,530
Mommy and Bob are going to look
for Big Foot.

379
00:18:16,654 --> 00:18:17,624
Okay, sugar plum?

380
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:18,633
Remember.

381
00:18:18,756 --> 00:18:20,533
Mommy loves you!

382
00:18:22,595 --> 00:18:23,667
Is she always like this?

383
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,471
Yeah, but it's not so bad.

384
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:28,578
And my friends!
It's so good to see you all!

385
00:18:28,668 --> 00:18:30,548
- Hey, you too!
- You look great.

386
00:18:30,637 --> 00:18:32,642
Weenie, it's been ages.

387
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,550
Thank you for it.

388
00:18:36,577 --> 00:18:37,555
Why?

389
00:18:37,713 --> 00:18:39,456
Who is our new friend?

390
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:40,585
I'd like you to meet Nate.

391
00:18:40,682 --> 00:18:42,619
Nate, meet Mr. Weenie.

392
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:44,691
He's a strong silent type.

393
00:18:44,821 --> 00:18:45,799
You!

394
00:18:45,823 --> 00:18:49,569
Are trying my patience!

395
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,630
Come on! Work you!

396
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:53,471
Work! Work! Work!

397
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:00,582
- Fussy. -Yeah?

398
00:19:00,706 --> 00:19:01,676
- Nine?
- Yeah?

399
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,449
- Nine? -Yeah.

400
00:19:03,576 --> 00:19:06,685
- You know, some animals are much
kinder once they've been. - Fixed!

401
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,559
Oh... Hi...

402
00:19:09,717 --> 00:19:10,595
Mr. Weenie.

403
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,530
Come and sit with me.

404
00:19:12,655 --> 00:19:15,627
We can watch the television together.

405
00:19:15,725 --> 00:19:17,605
He's not still mad at me, is he?

406
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:19,698
I think his angry days are behind him.

407
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,471
If you know what I mean.

408
00:19:21,565 --> 00:19:25,436
One night only!
The great Maslova Family Circus!

409
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,676
Hey! That's Boog!

410
00:19:26,771 --> 00:19:30,619
I don't remember Boog's fur being so
light and spiky like that.

411
00:19:30,742 --> 00:19:33,623
Listen, I know Boog as 'Zat' guy Boog!

412
00:19:33,746 --> 00:19:36,718
If that is Boog,
he sure looks terrible.

413
00:19:36,817 --> 00:19:38,628
Of course he looks terrible!

414
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,564
They're trying to kill him!

415
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:41,692
This is horrible!

416
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:42,724
Look out, Boog!

417
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:45,671
Poor Boog.

418
00:19:45,794 --> 00:19:47,469
We have to do something!

419
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:48,668
Let's go save him!

420
00:19:48,763 --> 00:19:50,609
Oh, I wanna go save him.

421
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,635
Oh please, please, please, please.

422
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:53,613
We must hurry!

423
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:56,618
How? Have you noticed?
We're in the air stream.

424
00:19:56,739 --> 00:19:57,674
There's no way out of here.

425
00:19:57,808 --> 00:19:59,585
How are we gonna save him?

426
00:20:04,649 --> 00:20:06,688
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

427
00:20:06,785 --> 00:20:07,763
No.

428
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,688
But if we climb out of that vent.

429
00:20:09,822 --> 00:20:11,702
I could track us to the circus.

430
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,432
To save Boog.

431
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,740
Yeah, the coast is clear!

432
00:20:17,797 --> 00:20:19,677
Keep it moving, keep it moving!

433
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,701
Keep it moving.

434
00:20:20,801 --> 00:20:21,702
Relax, Fifi.

435
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:24,580
Remember what the vet said
about staying calm?

436
00:20:24,674 --> 00:20:25,575
You stay calm!

437
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:28,646
With 500 pounds of animal on your back!

438
00:20:30,781 --> 00:20:32,490
Nice stitches!

439
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:37,556
Marshmallows?

440
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:39,635
Slightly burned.

441
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:43,470
Mixed with enoki.

442
00:20:43,563 --> 00:20:44,567
Robust poop!

443
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:46,545
What's with you always with the poop?

444
00:20:47,668 --> 00:20:48,740
The circus! This way!

445
00:20:50,872 --> 00:20:51,750
I'm okay.

446
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:52,750
I'm okay.

447
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,688
Come on.

448
00:20:56,845 --> 00:20:59,589
Who's up for a rabbit fight?

449
00:20:59,682 --> 00:21:01,562
Can't we wait for uncle Boog
to get back?

450
00:21:01,685 --> 00:21:03,531
He was supposed to be home last night.

451
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:06,467
Yeah! Do you think he's still mad at you
for ditching him on guys' trip?

452
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:09,562
He can stay on guys' trip forever
as far as I'm concerned.

453
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:11,696
What does he think?

454
00:21:11,829 --> 00:21:13,470
That I can just, you know.

455
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:17,503
Leave the kids alone, while Giselle
visits the mother in law of doom?

456
00:21:17,603 --> 00:21:19,676
- Dad.
- Children needs constant attention.

457
00:21:19,772 --> 00:21:21,743
- You ignore them for one second.
- Dad!

458
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:24,750
Come here, Little E.

459
00:21:25,778 --> 00:21:27,487
You're not going rogue, son.

460
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:29,490
Dad, let's just play, okay?

461
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,528
Good idea.

462
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,461
We don't need uncle Boog.

463
00:21:32,587 --> 00:21:33,761
Rabbit fights are way more fun
without him anyway.

464
00:21:34,623 --> 00:21:35,501
You're out.

465
00:21:35,758 --> 00:21:36,636
Gotcha.

466
00:21:38,729 --> 00:21:39,607
New game?

467
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,702
Well, that's enough fun for one day.

468
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:43,713
Now can we wait for uncle Boog
to come back?

469
00:21:43,835 --> 00:21:45,681
Boog, Boog, Boog.

470
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,549
From now on, we will no longer
mention his name.

471
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:49,679
Okay ....

472
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,617
So...

473
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,682
What do you wanna play next?

474
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:54,659
Well, how about a game of.

475
00:21:54,748 --> 00:21:56,650
Shrub.. Jump?

476
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:59,722
Diving?
Where we jump into the nearest shrub.

477
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,631
And uh.. Come on Elvis,
I'll show you.

478
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:02,726
Dad! No!

479
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,600
It's poison ivy!

480
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,512
It's part of the game.

481
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:14,482
Whoever scratches first.

482
00:22:14,705 --> 00:22:15,583
Loses!

483
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:19,855
Lwin!

484
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:24,627
Ooh, that has gotta hurt.

485
00:22:24,883 --> 00:22:26,763
Well played, Little E.

486
00:22:26,886 --> 00:22:28,629
Okay, who's hungry?

487
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:32,703
Dad.

488
00:22:33,626 --> 00:22:34,527
We need uncle B.

489
00:22:34,695 --> 00:22:35,573
I mean.

490
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,539
We need someone.

491
00:22:37,664 --> 00:22:38,565
Taller.

492
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:40,603
- To reach a branch that high.
- Not so.

493
00:22:40,835 --> 00:22:43,716
Who knows more about getting honey
than adeer, huh?

494
00:22:43,872 --> 00:22:45,547
Come here, Little E.

495
00:22:53,618 --> 00:22:54,622
Spine so frail.

496
00:23:02,595 --> 00:23:03,573
Dad?

497
00:23:03,596 --> 00:23:04,634
Quiet, Gisella.

498
00:23:04,765 --> 00:23:06,770
The slightest sound could wake the bees.

499
00:23:14,809 --> 00:23:17,790
Bees!

500
00:23:20,616 --> 00:23:22,587
At least getting stung will take
his mind off the itching.

501
00:23:22,786 --> 00:23:23,696
Yeah.

502
00:23:33,699 --> 00:23:34,771
Hey! Keep it down!

503
00:23:36,769 --> 00:23:37,773
Too much chocolate.

504
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:45,587
Hey, why did you do that?

505
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,557
Just hold still.

506
00:23:49,684 --> 00:23:51,564
Give a little poof over here.

507
00:23:51,653 --> 00:23:52,759
A tease over there.

508
00:23:52,854 --> 00:23:54,495
A pull, a tug.

509
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,628
A comb.

510
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:58,571
Make it snappy.
I am a genius.

511
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,641
Get a camera, because you are.

512
00:24:01,699 --> 00:24:02,577
Perfecto!

513
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:04,736
The spitting image.

514
00:24:04,837 --> 00:24:06,739
They will never know the difference.

515
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:09,752
Now, let us go dance.

516
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:12,586
Doug is here everybody!

517
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:16,559
Remember what they say about not talking.

518
00:24:16,684 --> 00:24:18,689
If you don't have something nice to say?

519
00:24:21,723 --> 00:24:22,795
She's beautiful.

520
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:30,671
I see what's going on here.

521
00:24:31,668 --> 00:24:32,706
What are you talking about?

522
00:24:32,836 --> 00:24:33,771
Nothing's going on here.

523
00:24:34,705 --> 00:24:35,683
Okay.

524
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:37,519
I'm serious.

525
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:38,714
Hm-hm?

526
00:24:38,844 --> 00:24:41,588
Hey, I'm just happy to meet
another grizzly. That's all.

527
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,783
Whatever you say.

528
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,694
Tiger. Show me your strength.

529
00:24:50,691 --> 00:24:51,569
So uh...

530
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:52,593
Hey, Ursa.

531
00:24:52,726 --> 00:24:55,630
- I thought I'd introduce myself,
because you know. - Doug?

532
00:24:55,764 --> 00:24:57,575
Why is voice low?

533
00:24:57,833 --> 00:24:59,542
Are you again. To be sick?

534
00:24:59,668 --> 00:25:00,740
Oh! Um.

535
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:03,674
- I'm not actually.
- You'd better not be.

536
00:25:03,806 --> 00:25:04,784
No!

537
00:25:04,807 --> 00:25:06,709
I mean, um.. Hey!

538
00:25:06,843 --> 00:25:08,518
Watch it with that stick, little dude!

539
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:09,717
Come on, Doug. Arms up!

540
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,783
Why must we go through this everyday?

541
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:13,523
A little bribe, perhaps?

542
00:25:13,617 --> 00:25:14,757
It's chocolate! You love chocolate.

543
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:16,663
- Come on, arms up!
- Please.

544
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:17,724
Now, we are ready.

545
00:25:17,856 --> 00:25:18,734
Let's begin.

546
00:25:23,664 --> 00:25:24,542
Right foot up!

547
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:25,610
Left foot up!

548
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,613
- Slower.
- Faster.

549
00:25:27,702 --> 00:25:28,703
Jump!

550
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:29,638
Squat leg!

551
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:33,813
- Stop!
- Wildly bear!

552
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:38,525
Hit it!

553
00:25:47,859 --> 00:25:49,739
You can really move.

554
00:25:50,662 --> 00:25:51,540
You ready?

555
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:53,607
Hey, I was born ready, baby.

556
00:25:57,637 --> 00:25:59,574
Wait, I'm not. I'm not ready for.

557
00:26:06,916 --> 00:26:09,797
Why can't you just once be there
when I need you?

558
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:11,559
Oh wait!

559
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:12,726
Ursa, let me explain.

560
00:26:13,622 --> 00:26:14,626
- I'm not.
- Doug!

561
00:26:14,758 --> 00:26:16,569
I don't want excuses.

562
00:26:16,693 --> 00:26:17,731
Maybe if you just.

563
00:26:17,827 --> 00:26:18,705
Cut the lift.

564
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,706
- That's all.
- No, wait!

565
00:26:19,831 --> 00:26:21,768
I could've caught you.
It's just that I'm not.

566
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:24,610
- Doug. Thanks a lot!
- Yeah, thanks Doug, okay?

567
00:26:24,737 --> 00:26:25,741
He only thinks all about himself.

568
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:27,512
- Listen, I'm not.
- Doug.

569
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,679
That was worse than yesterday.

570
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:33,748
Oh, wait!

571
00:26:33,881 --> 00:26:34,882
Ursa.

572
00:26:34,882 --> 00:26:38,594
Uh.. Give her some time
to cool down maybe, okay?

573
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:40,658
But I have to tell her who I really am.

574
00:26:41,656 --> 00:26:43,593
There will be plenty of time for that.

575
00:26:43,692 --> 00:26:46,766
When we are all living in Bear-vana.

576
00:26:47,697 --> 00:26:48,575
Trust me.

577
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:50,670
If there is one thing I know.

578
00:26:50,767 --> 00:26:51,737
It is women.

579
00:26:51,869 --> 00:26:53,746
And.

580
00:26:53,771 --> 00:26:54,741
Musical theater.

581
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,719
But that is not important right now.

582
00:26:56,908 --> 00:26:58,617
What is important.

583
00:26:58,844 --> 00:26:59,779
Is that women.

584
00:27:00,712 --> 00:27:03,650
Do not like to be rushed.

585
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:06,661
Look, Alistair buddy.

586
00:27:06,786 --> 00:27:09,599
I wait in here until
Doug is back at sunset

587
00:27:09,723 --> 00:27:11,603
And everything is gonna be fine.

588
00:27:12,794 --> 00:27:13,672
Alright, Alistair.

589
00:27:13,794 --> 00:27:14,695
If you say so.

590
00:27:30,814 --> 00:27:32,660
Alright ladies, buckle up.

591
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:35,598
- One two three four.
- Look, I'm flying!

592
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,634
This must be the place.

593
00:27:40,726 --> 00:27:41,730
Bear-vana.

594
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,778
Finally.

595
00:27:46,901 --> 00:27:47,802
I'm the only bear.

596
00:27:47,902 --> 00:27:50,544
And all the animals are gonna worship me.

597
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:51,677
Just like they did Boog.

598
00:27:51,807 --> 00:27:53,653
Boog's back, everybody!

599
00:27:53,777 --> 00:27:55,782
- Boog!
- Thank goodness, he's back!

600
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:57,689
- Yes.
- About time.

601
00:27:58,782 --> 00:27:59,717
Yeah, I know.

602
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:01,626
It's good to finally be here.

603
00:28:01,752 --> 00:28:02,756
You look terrible!

604
00:28:02,887 --> 00:28:04,789
And your voice seems worse!

605
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:07,668
Yeah. Complete Gaga girl.

606
00:28:07,793 --> 00:28:09,673
What are you talking about?

607
00:28:09,762 --> 00:28:11,664
My voice is as smooth as silk.

608
00:28:11,798 --> 00:28:13,609
Must have been rough out there.

609
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,841
Rough? Yeah, it was rough alright.

610
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:17,644
That's why I look terrible.

611
00:28:17,771 --> 00:28:18,741
My voice sounds like Ka-Ka.

612
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:21,548
Now why don't you all run along
and fetch me some goodies?

613
00:28:21,642 --> 00:28:22,577
Goodies smoothies.

614
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:24,713
Boog!

615
00:28:26,916 --> 00:28:27,894
Here.

616
00:28:27,884 --> 00:28:29,661
Hold these for a second.

617
00:28:29,784 --> 00:28:33,632
How dare you show your face around here?

618
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:35,602
After what you've done?

619
00:28:37,728 --> 00:28:39,608
Gotta go polish my...

620
00:28:39,697 --> 00:28:40,735
Uh. Me too.

621
00:28:40,865 --> 00:28:41,743
Me three.

622
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:42,844
Yeah.

623
00:28:43,702 --> 00:28:44,680
Dad.

624
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,605
I thought you were going to apologise?

625
00:28:46,939 --> 00:28:47,817
Apologise?

626
00:28:47,941 --> 00:28:50,651
If anyone should apologise, it's him.

627
00:28:50,776 --> 00:28:51,654
To me.

628
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:52,779
For.

629
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:53,814
For.

630
00:28:54,916 --> 00:28:55,894
This!

631
00:28:56,719 --> 00:28:57,597
And this!

632
00:28:57,786 --> 00:28:58,664
Then this!

633
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:02,703
Well?

634
00:29:04,694 --> 00:29:05,664
The silent treatment.

635
00:29:05,795 --> 00:29:07,800
Well, I too can play at that game.

636
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:10,607
Only I'm not playing.

637
00:29:10,701 --> 00:29:12,706
I was fine before I met you.

638
00:29:12,804 --> 00:29:14,775
Oh, sure, I was tied
to the hood of the car.

639
00:29:14,873 --> 00:29:17,754
Sorry uncle Boog. Dad hasn't been the
same since you've been gone.

640
00:29:17,877 --> 00:29:20,758
Now look at me. A pathetic shell.

641
00:29:20,847 --> 00:29:25,753
And all because of you!

642
00:29:25,886 --> 00:29:27,732
It's too late now, Boog.

643
00:29:27,821 --> 00:29:28,722
This deer.

644
00:29:28,822 --> 00:29:29,792
Has sailed.

645
00:29:31,759 --> 00:29:32,637
Sorry uncle Boog.

646
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,571
I hope you guys can work things out.

647
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:36,742
Dad!

648
00:29:37,766 --> 00:29:39,646
We're all glad you're back, uncle Boog!

649
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:43,709
That is one seriously messed up deer.

650
00:29:44,675 --> 00:29:45,610
That's better.

651
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:46,846
Good to be myself again.

652
00:29:49,914 --> 00:29:51,623
Time to hit the road.

653
00:29:58,891 --> 00:29:59,869
Doug?

654
00:30:10,707 --> 00:30:11,711
He's not coming back.

655
00:30:11,841 --> 00:30:12,776
Give him a chance.

656
00:30:12,876 --> 00:30:13,811
It's still early.

657
00:30:13,944 --> 00:30:15,721
Besides, he's a grizzly.

658
00:30:15,846 --> 00:30:16,724
We're family.

659
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:21,687
It's all a lie.

660
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,827
There is no Bear-vana.

661
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:25,857
Come on, Alistair. He'll be back.

662
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:28,672
Grizzlies hate each other.

663
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,571
It's in their genes.

664
00:30:30,697 --> 00:30:31,667
What are you talking about?

665
00:30:31,765 --> 00:30:32,803
Grizzlies don't hate each other.

666
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:34,608
The mens do!

667
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:37,673
They are to macho.

668
00:30:40,675 --> 00:30:42,748
Doug lied so you would help him escape.

669
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,590
And I...

670
00:30:44,713 --> 00:30:47,594
I was his partner in crime!

671
00:30:49,718 --> 00:30:50,722
In crime!

672
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:56,695
Who have I become?

673
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:00,638
If Doug's not coming back.

674
00:31:01,733 --> 00:31:02,737
Then Ursa won't talk to me.

675
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:04,673
What am I doing here?

676
00:31:20,724 --> 00:31:22,604
This one goes to my girlfriend.

677
00:31:22,726 --> 00:31:23,832
Out on the Pampas.

678
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,864
I'm all alone.

679
00:31:26,997 --> 00:31:28,843
My heart.

680
00:31:28,933 --> 00:31:31,780
Has crushed to nada.

681
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:35,786
I'm all alone.

682
00:31:41,949 --> 00:31:44,728
It won't work.

683
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,858
Don't bother trying.

684
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:55,705
If you try that.

685
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:57,769
You'll go flying.

686
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:23,699
What are you looking at?

687
00:32:23,864 --> 00:32:24,742
Nothing.

688
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:25,870
That was. Well, you were.

689
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:27,872
That was beautiful.

690
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,807
You are making fun.

691
00:32:30,906 --> 00:32:31,784
No! No! Really!

692
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:34,746
Listen, Ursa.

693
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:37,659
I know you've got no reason to believe me.

694
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:38,888
But I gotta tell you the truth!

695
00:32:38,983 --> 00:32:40,624
I'm not Doug.

696
00:32:40,785 --> 00:32:41,663
I'm Boog!

697
00:32:42,754 --> 00:32:43,632
You are right.

698
00:32:44,723 --> 00:32:45,727
I have no reason to believe you.

699
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:47,897
Look. I never should've come here.

700
00:32:47,993 --> 00:32:48,871
I know that now.

701
00:32:48,996 --> 00:32:50,773
This was all a big mistake.

702
00:32:50,898 --> 00:32:52,800
Why is fur dark?

703
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:53,811
Like I told you.

704
00:32:53,935 --> 00:32:55,610
I'm not Doug.

705
00:32:55,736 --> 00:32:56,614
I'm Boog.

706
00:32:56,803 --> 00:32:57,807
I was just you know.

707
00:32:57,905 --> 00:32:59,682
Looking for a place where I belong.

708
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:02,620
So, if you just give me a hand moving
one of the carts.

709
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:03,680
I'll be out of your hair.

710
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:05,852
Oh, now I see truth.

711
00:33:05,982 --> 00:33:07,884
You want me to help you escape.

712
00:33:07,984 --> 00:33:09,659
And ruin circus!

713
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:11,791
- No!
- You are pathetic, Doug.

714
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,735
No, Ursa, seriously.

715
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:14,758
I just.

716
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:30,745
You twanged?

717
00:33:30,911 --> 00:33:31,889
No.

718
00:33:31,913 --> 00:33:34,589
Okay, 'cos I thought I heard my name.

719
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:35,685
It doesn't matter.

720
00:33:35,784 --> 00:33:38,665
I. Just want you to know that.

721
00:33:38,754 --> 00:33:39,724
I am sorry.

722
00:33:40,756 --> 00:33:42,863
I really thought Doug was my best friend.

723
00:33:42,958 --> 00:33:43,859
That's okay.

724
00:33:43,993 --> 00:33:46,669
I suck at picking best friends too.

725
00:33:46,764 --> 00:33:48,644
Are we good? You and me?

726
00:33:48,766 --> 00:33:49,744
Yeah!

727
00:33:49,768 --> 00:33:50,646
We're good.

728
00:33:50,835 --> 00:33:51,713
Excellente.

729
00:33:51,903 --> 00:33:55,774
I promise I will never tell you
I'm coming back when I'm not.

730
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,719
And I promise I'll make time for you..

731
00:33:57,811 --> 00:34:00,590
Even when I got a bunch of
important things going on.

732
00:34:00,714 --> 00:34:01,786
- Amigos?
- Yeah!

733
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:02,783
Amigos.

734
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,694
This is nice.

735
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:05,923
Talking like this.

736
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:08,663
We will do this every night.

737
00:34:08,856 --> 00:34:10,861
A kind of. Guys chat.

738
00:34:10,959 --> 00:34:11,937
Si?

739
00:34:12,728 --> 00:34:13,606
Guys chat?

740
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,708
I like that.

741
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:16,836
Good, okay, so...

742
00:34:17,834 --> 00:34:21,648
Since you're stuck here.
A little advice, okay?

743
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,641
The way to a woman's heart.

744
00:34:24,008 --> 00:34:24,886
Is through.

745
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,988
Her.

746
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,988
Art.

747
00:34:33,786 --> 00:34:34,790
The circus is coming!

748
00:34:34,921 --> 00:34:37,700
How can a circus be coming?
A circus is a tent.

749
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,762
With posts, stuck in the ground!

750
00:34:39,861 --> 00:34:40,762
This is a highway!

751
00:34:46,034 --> 00:34:47,880
Oh no! No!

752
00:34:48,771 --> 00:34:49,649
Thank you.

753
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:52,718
We made it.

754
00:34:52,842 --> 00:34:53,914
That wasn't easy.

755
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:56,823
- This still doesn't look like a circus.
- Strange.

756
00:34:57,848 --> 00:34:59,659
It sure smells like it.

757
00:35:00,786 --> 00:35:01,764
No!

758
00:35:01,787 --> 00:35:03,689
I need those! I need those!

759
00:35:03,822 --> 00:35:04,792
I need them!

760
00:35:05,959 --> 00:35:07,668
There you go, baby.

761
00:35:08,027 --> 00:35:08,905
Just like new.

762
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:13,871
- Hi, how's it going, Stew?
- So far so good.

763
00:35:14,002 --> 00:35:15,779
I got your balloon order.

764
00:35:16,004 --> 00:35:17,713
How could you have been so wrong?

765
00:35:17,806 --> 00:35:18,684
I don't know?

766
00:35:18,807 --> 00:35:19,777
Maybe it's allergy.

767
00:35:19,875 --> 00:35:20,753
Wait a minute.

768
00:35:20,875 --> 00:35:21,845
Look in the window!

769
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:25,621
The circus poster will tell us
where to find Boog.

770
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,626
Quickly!

771
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,754
Before we are seen!

772
00:35:27,985 --> 00:35:29,694
There you go, baby.

773
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:33,896
Wait 'til you see the super balloon
bouquet I whipped up for ya.

774
00:35:36,828 --> 00:35:39,709
Nice exploration of negative space.

775
00:35:39,832 --> 00:35:41,803
Hurry up! I should be on top!

776
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:42,905
- I should be on the top!
- A little closer!

777
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,849
- Don't wave!
- Nine, a little closer.

778
00:35:45,939 --> 00:35:48,649
Meat snack.

779
00:35:48,776 --> 00:35:49,848
Look, they're colored.

780
00:35:49,944 --> 00:35:51,653
It's perfect replacement.

781
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:52,657
I need those.

782
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,886
Hey! Stop that!

783
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:55,793
We have been discovered!

784
00:35:55,884 --> 00:35:58,663
You just. Hey!

785
00:35:58,754 --> 00:35:59,632
Come back here!

786
00:36:00,757 --> 00:36:01,735
No!

787
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:02,860
I'm gonna get you!

788
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:04,804
Get back here!

789
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:16,786
Gotcha!

790
00:36:18,846 --> 00:36:19,724
Meat Snack!

791
00:36:23,985 --> 00:36:24,863
Meat Snack.

792
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:25,864
Come back here!

793
00:36:33,997 --> 00:36:35,877
You knew you were going
to this guys' trip.

794
00:36:35,999 --> 00:36:38,675
For two whole weeks before you told him.

795
00:36:38,770 --> 00:36:39,944
Maybe I should go talk to him.

796
00:36:40,037 --> 00:36:42,747
Hold it right there, big fella.

797
00:36:42,841 --> 00:36:43,879
So you forgot.

798
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:45,888
If he was a real friend.

799
00:36:45,978 --> 00:36:48,654
- He'd understand.
- You're absolutely right!

800
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:49,920
Boog is a real friend.

801
00:36:50,015 --> 00:36:52,725
Your life is a mess without him.

802
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:54,925
By mess you mean awesome!

803
00:36:55,022 --> 00:36:55,900
No, I mean mess!

804
00:36:56,023 --> 00:36:57,664
- Awesome!
- Stop that!

805
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:58,932
- Enough!
- Dad?

806
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,708
Girls.

807
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,800
I was just.

808
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:05,711
Not important.

809
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:07,645
So, is it breakfast time again?

810
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:08,842
Lunch? Dinner? Play time?

811
00:37:09,772 --> 00:37:10,946
Is it a dope problem?

812
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,817
What's a dope problem?

813
00:37:12,909 --> 00:37:13,844
Nothing, what's up?

814
00:37:14,044 --> 00:37:15,855
Mom always says that.

815
00:37:18,016 --> 00:37:19,793
You should try and work things out.

816
00:37:21,987 --> 00:37:23,696
You're upset with me?

817
00:37:24,056 --> 00:37:25,697
You're right!

818
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:27,693
I've been a complete failure.

819
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,676
How can you ever forgive me?

820
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:34,746
We were talking about you and uncle Boog?

821
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:35,942
You should go talk to him.

822
00:37:38,807 --> 00:37:41,711
Or maybe we should go and get uncle Boog.

823
00:37:41,811 --> 00:37:42,849
Bring him. Here.

824
00:37:44,947 --> 00:37:46,827
And you're not a complete failure.

825
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:48,820
You're a dad.

826
00:37:48,953 --> 00:37:50,799
We love you no matter what.

827
00:37:51,957 --> 00:37:53,666
Father?

828
00:37:55,995 --> 00:37:56,873
It's okay.

829
00:38:00,866 --> 00:38:01,938
All for the taking.

830
00:38:02,034 --> 00:38:03,845
Hey Boog! Can you help me with my digging?

831
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:06,875
Can you help me get my wife
unstacked from the pine?

832
00:38:06,975 --> 00:38:08,786
- What.
- Can you help me with my nuts?

833
00:38:08,876 --> 00:38:10,687
- I mean...
- Thought we were gonna mark the perimeter?

834
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:11,884
- Hold on!
- What about our habitat?

835
00:38:12,014 --> 00:38:13,757
- Yeah!
- Hey Boog, can you help me with thing?

836
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,926
Do you think dad and uncle Boog will
ever forgive each other?

837
00:38:20,056 --> 00:38:22,698
What's going to happen if they don't?

838
00:38:23,059 --> 00:38:23,937
Enough!

839
00:38:24,829 --> 00:38:25,707
Enough!

840
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:30,770
Enough!

841
00:38:34,873 --> 00:38:35,843
I'm not your servant!

842
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:38,814
I'm king of the jungle!

843
00:38:38,945 --> 00:38:41,883
Well, technically the lion
is the king of the jungle.

844
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:43,863
And this is the forest.

845
00:38:43,985 --> 00:38:45,865
A jungle tends to be denser and hotter.

846
00:38:45,955 --> 00:38:47,732
- Deer!
- What?

847
00:38:47,824 --> 00:38:48,702
I travel.

848
00:38:48,824 --> 00:38:50,795
Fine! Then I'm king of the forest!

849
00:38:50,994 --> 00:38:51,872
Either way.

850
00:38:51,994 --> 00:38:53,805
Things are gonna change around here.

851
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,935
You! Go get me some nice ripped berries.

852
00:38:56,066 --> 00:38:59,812
And you two. Find me a good waterfall
where I can have a nice soak.

853
00:38:59,971 --> 00:39:00,906
And you Doily!

854
00:39:01,806 --> 00:39:02,684
Riley!

855
00:39:02,808 --> 00:39:03,743
Whatever!

856
00:39:03,843 --> 00:39:06,815
You and your guys go build me
a nice comfortable bed.

857
00:39:06,913 --> 00:39:07,848
Up on that hill.

858
00:39:07,948 --> 00:39:10,727
Don't you mean in your cave?

859
00:39:10,851 --> 00:39:12,788
Oh, yeah.

860
00:39:12,886 --> 00:39:13,821
My cave.

861
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,868
Move!

862
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,700
Better do what he says.

863
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:19,831
He's gone bluhnicaccasl

864
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:22,936
He has really lost it.

865
00:39:23,065 --> 00:39:24,706
- Yeah.
- Could be stress.

866
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,838
Big mad bear disease.

867
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:27,745
It could be stupid deer disease.

868
00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:29,683
Seriously? Is that going around?

869
00:39:29,806 --> 00:39:32,949
Maybe we've all been taking him for
granted a little too much.

870
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:47,705
Oh! Hello girls.

871
00:39:47,994 --> 00:39:49,931
How long have you two been standing there?

872
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,705
We just uh.

873
00:39:51,899 --> 00:39:52,834
Got here?

874
00:39:54,069 --> 00:39:54,947
What is that?

875
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,847
Some kind of nervous tick?

876
00:39:58,074 --> 00:39:58,952
Nervous?

877
00:39:59,976 --> 00:40:01,753
Who's nervous?

878
00:40:01,878 --> 00:40:02,882
What do you girls want?

879
00:40:02,979 --> 00:40:04,825
We just wanted to say.

880
00:40:04,948 --> 00:40:05,918
How glad we are that you're back.

881
00:40:06,050 --> 00:40:07,028
Bye!

882
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:13,970
Hey. Perhaps Boog is uh. Changing

883
00:40:14,092 --> 00:40:16,734
- That's not it.
- We change all the time, huh?

884
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:19,910
Just yesterday.
Deni, he's in love with foei gras.

885
00:40:20,034 --> 00:40:21,743
Then I tell him what it is, and.

886
00:40:21,835 --> 00:40:22,805
He can't talk, he can't sleep.

887
00:40:22,937 --> 00:40:24,714
He saved me.

888
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:25,877
Can you just go and find our mom?

889
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,907
Please?

890
00:40:27,042 --> 00:40:28,819
I'll be your best friend.

891
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,915
Alright, alright, you twist my wing.

892
00:40:31,012 --> 00:40:33,756
But only because the two of you
are so good.

893
00:40:33,883 --> 00:40:34,955
Thank you Serge!

894
00:40:35,051 --> 00:40:37,761
- You guys rock!
- Deni, follow my tail!

895
00:40:40,824 --> 00:40:41,759
What do you think?

896
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:45,873
Your tie is a smart bow tie.

897
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:46,908
Perfecto!

898
00:40:47,866 --> 00:40:49,803
I see you're sweating.

899
00:40:49,935 --> 00:40:51,837
Nervous anticipation.

900
00:40:51,937 --> 00:40:52,907
What are you talking about?

901
00:40:53,006 --> 00:40:54,943
- I'm not sweating?
- Yes, you are.

902
00:40:55,041 --> 00:40:58,787
I see a little drop of moisture
on your upper brow.

903
00:40:58,945 --> 00:40:59,823
Right there.

904
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,793
- Hello little sweat.
- Yeah, sweat.

905
00:41:02,884 --> 00:41:03,762
Right.

906
00:41:03,885 --> 00:41:06,789
Nothing to worry! You're gonna
knock her out with the real you!

907
00:41:06,889 --> 00:41:08,700
She'd be like. Doug!

908
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:09,726
Who is Doug?

909
00:41:09,927 --> 00:41:11,829
I'm all about Boog, baby!

910
00:41:11,929 --> 00:41:14,708
There is something different about Doug.

911
00:41:14,832 --> 00:41:16,837
Looks like someone got a
hair brush for birthday.

912
00:41:23,008 --> 00:41:24,854
- Still think I'm Doug?
- Yes.

913
00:41:27,047 --> 00:41:27,925
How about now?

914
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,818
What are you trying to prove, Doug?

915
00:41:30,951 --> 00:41:31,921
That I'm Boog!

916
00:41:32,052 --> 00:41:33,727
Let's try the ladder.

917
00:41:33,821 --> 00:41:34,756
Oh, forget it.

918
00:41:38,092 --> 00:41:40,768
- Well, can you ride.
- Unicycle?

919
00:41:42,097 --> 00:41:43,704
Check this out.

920
00:41:44,968 --> 00:41:45,946
See?

921
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:46,847
I'm Boog!

922
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:50,852
Look, I'm sorry we got off
on the wrong foot.

923
00:41:50,941 --> 00:41:51,911
But once you get to know me.

924
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:52,979
The real me.

925
00:41:53,110 --> 00:41:55,718
- You might like me.
- Leave me alone!

926
00:42:05,825 --> 00:42:06,863
Doug was afraid of heights.

927
00:42:06,993 --> 00:42:08,964
If you're really Boog.

928
00:42:09,063 --> 00:42:11,705
Why don't you come up here and prove it?

929
00:42:11,899 --> 00:42:12,777
Don't give up.

930
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:13,871
Follow her.

931
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,974
She wants you to.

932
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:18,818
That's. Pretty high.

933
00:42:19,877 --> 00:42:20,881
You're probably right.

934
00:42:24,082 --> 00:42:26,724
That impressed a pretty girl.

935
00:42:26,851 --> 00:42:28,025
- Hm.
- Just go!

936
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:33,769
One can't help but be moved, no?

937
00:42:48,911 --> 00:42:49,915
Now you believe me?

938
00:42:50,112 --> 00:42:52,822
I believed you when you
ride the unicycle.

939
00:42:52,949 --> 00:42:54,760
Doug couldn't do that either.

940
00:42:54,851 --> 00:42:56,992
You mean you made me climb
all the way up here for nothing?

941
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:58,728
Not for nothing.

942
00:42:58,822 --> 00:43:00,724
You need to be punished
for juggling the dog.

943
00:43:11,904 --> 00:43:12,882
Boog.

944
00:43:13,073 --> 00:43:14,782
What a nice name.

945
00:43:17,945 --> 00:43:19,916
If you want to practice the dance.

946
00:43:21,015 --> 00:43:21,950
Meet me outside.

947
00:43:24,052 --> 00:43:25,761
You put a girl in grizzly!

948
00:43:29,926 --> 00:43:33,797
Cats, tonight, you're gonna
play your little whiskers off.

949
00:43:33,931 --> 00:43:35,003
And a one and a two.

950
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,779
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...

951
00:43:40,072 --> 00:43:43,977
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...

952
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:48,720
Miaw, miaw, miaw, miaw...

953
00:43:48,849 --> 00:43:49,887
You dance very well, Boog.

954
00:43:50,885 --> 00:43:51,763
I practiced.

955
00:43:51,885 --> 00:43:54,732
I figured you might trip me
or something if I messed up.

956
00:43:54,923 --> 00:43:55,901
Me?

957
00:43:55,924 --> 00:43:57,030
I would never do that.

958
00:43:57,893 --> 00:43:59,773
Yeah, but I might.

959
00:43:59,995 --> 00:44:00,965
So you'd better watch yourself.

960
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:07,845
Oh, definitely looking good.

961
00:44:09,007 --> 00:44:10,887
You are not like other bears.

962
00:44:11,976 --> 00:44:12,854
Why is this?

963
00:44:12,977 --> 00:44:13,855
I don't know.

964
00:44:13,978 --> 00:44:15,949
Maybe it's because
I grew up with humans.

965
00:44:16,081 --> 00:44:16,959
Really?

966
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:18,962
Me too!
I grew up in circus!

967
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:19,962
Me too!

968
00:44:20,921 --> 00:44:21,993
Well. Kinda.

969
00:44:22,088 --> 00:44:24,798
I mean, I used to do this
show back in Timber Line.

970
00:44:24,926 --> 00:44:25,930
It wasn't a whole circus.

971
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:27,837
But I juggled and stuff.

972
00:44:28,896 --> 00:44:29,774
You and me.

973
00:44:29,897 --> 00:44:31,868
We are not like other grizzlies.

974
00:44:32,066 --> 00:44:33,775
We are not like.

975
00:44:33,902 --> 00:44:35,941
Anybody else in the world!

976
00:44:53,926 --> 00:44:55,772
That was so inspiring.

977
00:44:56,063 --> 00:44:56,941
So moving.

978
00:44:58,065 --> 00:45:00,002
So. So prof undo.

979
00:45:00,134 --> 00:45:02,913
Let us retire to the caravan.

980
00:45:03,005 --> 00:45:05,010
For our end of the day talk.

981
00:45:06,074 --> 00:45:07,954
We should practice the lift.

982
00:45:08,077 --> 00:45:09,752
I'd like that.

983
00:45:10,112 --> 00:45:11,090
Come.

984
00:45:11,915 --> 00:45:12,850
We will hook.

985
00:45:12,983 --> 00:45:14,829
Over to the trailer.

986
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:17,856
Time to share.

987
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:19,832
Like the amigos we are!

988
00:45:21,926 --> 00:45:22,930
I pulled something.

989
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,800
If just once I could perform the dance.

990
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:28,774
The way it was meant to be.

991
00:45:29,102 --> 00:45:30,948
I would never need to perform it again.

992
00:45:31,971 --> 00:45:32,849
Boogie!

993
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:35,782
What about the guys chat?

994
00:45:36,043 --> 00:45:37,889
Huh? Yeah.

995
00:45:37,978 --> 00:45:39,858
Ursa and I need to practice.

996
00:46:19,128 --> 00:46:20,006
Doily!

997
00:46:20,129 --> 00:46:22,908
Make sure you get that spot
right by my third...

998
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:25,743
Ooh! Yeah!

999
00:46:25,870 --> 00:46:26,748
That's it!

1000
00:46:29,874 --> 00:46:30,844
Sorry Boogster.

1001
00:46:30,975 --> 00:46:32,047
Just a little cramp at my neck.

1002
00:46:32,144 --> 00:46:33,022
Seriously?

1003
00:46:33,145 --> 00:46:35,787
Six pack, take some pride in your work!

1004
00:46:35,915 --> 00:46:37,988
Any chance we can take a little break?

1005
00:46:38,084 --> 00:46:40,021
A break? You all just had a break.

1006
00:46:40,153 --> 00:46:41,999
Like. Six hours ago.

1007
00:46:42,089 --> 00:46:42,990
What is going on here?

1008
00:46:43,924 --> 00:46:44,894
Giselle!

1009
00:46:44,993 --> 00:46:45,963
Thank goodness! You're back!

1010
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:47,769
Now you can vent him.

1011
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:48,739
Excellent!

1012
00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:49,798
Reenforcements.

1013
00:46:49,964 --> 00:46:51,866
You two!
Go get me some more berries.

1014
00:46:51,966 --> 00:46:54,779
And you! How about you start
massaging my paws?

1015
00:46:54,904 --> 00:46:56,977
All this clapping is making me sore.

1016
00:47:01,111 --> 00:47:02,089
Now!

1017
00:47:02,947 --> 00:47:04,952
- Who are you?
- What are you talking about?

1018
00:47:05,049 --> 00:47:06,951
Boog would never yell like that.

1019
00:47:07,085 --> 00:47:08,828
Especially at fawns.

1020
00:47:08,919 --> 00:47:09,957
So who are you?

1021
00:47:10,055 --> 00:47:10,933
Who am I?

1022
00:47:11,057 --> 00:47:13,836
- If you haven't noticed, I'm.
- Boog!

1023
00:47:14,161 --> 00:47:16,837
I'm so sorry I let you down.

1024
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:20,835
- Can you ever forgive me?
- Does that answer your question?

1025
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:23,850
Giselle!

1026
00:47:23,972 --> 00:47:25,783
Oh, thank goodness you're back.

1027
00:47:26,909 --> 00:47:27,887
See?

1028
00:47:27,910 --> 00:47:29,949
Even the crazy broken deer
knows I'm Boog.

1029
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:31,926
Do you even know his name?

1030
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:33,826
Of course I do.

1031
00:47:33,917 --> 00:47:35,763
It's. Uh.

1032
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:37,027
Starts with an E.

1033
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:38,932
E .... Emily?

1034
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:39,935
Edward?

1035
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:41,961
What about 2 L's?

1036
00:47:42,094 --> 00:47:43,803
Eleanor? Oh, whatever.

1037
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,035
It doesn't matter what his name is.

1038
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:46,839
All that matters.

1039
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:47,902
It's that I'm a grizzly.

1040
00:47:48,034 --> 00:47:49,914
And I'm king of the jungle.

1041
00:47:50,036 --> 00:47:51,916
First of all, this is a forest.

1042
00:47:52,005 --> 00:47:53,043
I tried to tell him.

1043
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:54,781
And second of all.

1044
00:47:54,876 --> 00:47:55,846
What have you done with Boog?

1045
00:47:55,977 --> 00:47:57,914
- Yeah!
- Where is Boog?

1046
00:47:58,013 --> 00:47:58,983
What have you done?

1047
00:47:59,114 --> 00:48:00,960
What difference does it make?

1048
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:03,828
You would all do what I say.

1049
00:48:03,952 --> 00:48:05,854
I'm your Boog now!

1050
00:48:05,989 --> 00:48:06,967
Boog!

1051
00:48:06,990 --> 00:48:08,062
Boog, now that we're
best friends again.

1052
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:09,934
What do you say we go on guys trip?

1053
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:11,064
Just the two of us?

1054
00:48:11,161 --> 00:48:13,007
He's not Boog!

1055
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:17,945
Oops.

1056
00:48:19,004 --> 00:48:20,815
You're not Boog!

1057
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,819
That's not Boog!

1058
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:23,912
Oh, thank goodness.

1059
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:24,980
I thought you were mad at me.

1060
00:48:25,112 --> 00:48:26,821
But now I know that you weren't.

1061
00:48:26,915 --> 00:48:27,816
Because you're not even you!

1062
00:48:28,149 --> 00:48:29,027
What a relief.

1063
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:30,825
- Elliot?
- Yes, dear?

1064
00:48:30,953 --> 00:48:32,025
- Elliot!
- Oh, right.

1065
00:48:32,154 --> 00:48:33,032
What have you done with Boog?

1066
00:48:33,155 --> 00:48:35,865
He's locked away somewhere.
You'll never find him!

1067
00:48:35,958 --> 00:48:38,031
Especially after tonight,
when they take him back to Russia.

1068
00:48:39,062 --> 00:48:39,940
Russia?

1069
00:48:40,063 --> 00:48:42,000
- Who's Russia?
- It's not a 'who'!

1070
00:48:42,132 --> 00:48:43,010
It's a 'where'.

1071
00:48:43,134 --> 00:48:44,035
And believe me.

1072
00:48:44,135 --> 00:48:47,073
You could walk for the rest
of your life and never get there.

1073
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,915
You won't get away with this!

1074
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:52,821
No? Who's gonna stop me?

1075
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,993
Okay! Okay!
Okay, I'm ready to talk.

1076
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:58,791
I'm listening.

1077
00:48:58,918 --> 00:48:59,853
He's at the circus.

1078
00:48:59,987 --> 00:49:01,958
Just follow the search lights
and you'll find it.

1079
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:03,894
That's a good one.

1080
00:49:04,024 --> 00:49:05,096
What search lights?

1081
00:49:10,966 --> 00:49:12,846
Now let's go save Boog!

1082
00:49:12,969 --> 00:49:14,906
'Cos I owe him a big apology.

1083
00:49:17,007 --> 00:49:18,784
And because we miss him

1084
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,982
And we want him to come home
before they ship him off to Russia!

1085
00:49:21,078 --> 00:49:22,079
Yeah!

1086
00:49:24,949 --> 00:49:25,827
Imposter!

1087
00:49:26,085 --> 00:49:26,963
Sorry.

1088
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,808
That Boog sure is one lucky guy.

1089
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:39,010
I Wish I had a friend like that.

1090
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:42,948
Wait.

1091
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:44,952
I do have a friend like that.

1092
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,845
Thank goodness, that nice man
at the Punimart called us.

1093
00:49:48,978 --> 00:49:50,050
You poor dear's.

1094
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:53,856
Must have been hungry to go
all that way to find food.

1095
00:49:53,984 --> 00:49:54,919
But don't worry.

1096
00:49:55,019 --> 00:49:56,899
Mommy won't make that mistake again.

1097
00:50:01,994 --> 00:50:03,874
That's enough, isn't it, Bob?

1098
00:50:03,963 --> 00:50:06,810
Maybe we should stay.
No, no, you're right.

1099
00:50:06,932 --> 00:50:09,005
My snugly, woddly and I
need this time apart.

1100
00:50:09,102 --> 00:50:11,915
Kick me out, Bob,
before I change my mind.

1101
00:50:14,042 --> 00:50:17,822
Well, we might as well dig in,
since all hope is lost.

1102
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:19,884
Wait for it, wait for it!

1103
00:50:19,982 --> 00:50:22,954
Oh, Meat Snack!

1104
00:50:23,085 --> 00:50:25,829
Excuse me for a moment.

1105
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:30,929
I hate cats.

1106
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,836
So do I.

1107
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,832
Fi! Look! The circus!

1108
00:50:34,967 --> 00:50:36,073
I've seen of these lights before.

1109
00:50:38,137 --> 00:50:39,115
Wait!

1110
00:50:39,138 --> 00:50:41,985
You mean the circus
is just behind those trees?

1111
00:50:42,075 --> 00:50:44,819
Yes! My new old friend!

1112
00:50:44,911 --> 00:50:48,884
Boog is closer than we ever imagined.

1113
00:51:10,209 --> 00:51:11,087
Alistair?

1114
00:51:11,978 --> 00:51:12,856
What's wrong?

1115
00:51:12,979 --> 00:51:13,880
And once again.

1116
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,927
I have been tossed away.

1117
00:51:18,017 --> 00:51:19,919
Hey, hey, Alistair.

1118
00:51:20,054 --> 00:51:20,989
Come on, buddy.

1119
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:23,095
Don't bother me!

1120
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,969
I sat in my trailer all night.

1121
00:51:26,094 --> 00:51:29,066
Waiting for the sweet sound of paws.

1122
00:51:29,165 --> 00:51:30,874
Knocking on my door.

1123
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:31,868
But no.

1124
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:32,901
All I hear.

1125
00:51:33,002 --> 00:51:34,040
Is the sounds.

1126
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:35,914
Of loneliness.

1127
00:51:36,105 --> 00:51:37,814
What are you talking about?

1128
00:51:37,942 --> 00:51:38,912
Have you forgotten?

1129
00:51:39,043 --> 00:51:39,921
Already?

1130
00:51:40,043 --> 00:51:41,945
Do I mean so little to you?

1131
00:51:43,114 --> 00:51:45,085
It's time for guys chat

1132
00:51:45,216 --> 00:51:47,096
Just us on guys chat.

1133
00:51:47,219 --> 00:51:49,929
You blew off guys chat!

1134
00:51:50,223 --> 00:51:51,101
You blew it!

1135
00:51:52,124 --> 00:51:53,002
Oh man!

1136
00:51:53,927 --> 00:51:54,862
I totally forgot!

1137
00:51:54,995 --> 00:51:56,101
See, I was with Ursa and.

1138
00:51:56,229 --> 00:51:59,008
Well, you know how it is
when you're all caught up and.

1139
00:52:01,135 --> 00:52:02,070
Look, Alistair.

1140
00:52:03,005 --> 00:52:04,885
Sometimes it's hard to find
time for everything.

1141
00:52:04,975 --> 00:52:06,946
And everyone that's important to you.

1142
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:08,922
Alistair.

1143
00:52:16,154 --> 00:52:17,032
Alistair.

1144
00:52:18,056 --> 00:52:18,934
You're right.

1145
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:20,901
I've been a bad friend.

1146
00:52:22,061 --> 00:52:23,872
You might not believe this, but.

1147
00:52:25,065 --> 00:52:27,036
I know exactly how you feel right now.

1148
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,036
And I'm sorry.

1149
00:52:31,071 --> 00:52:31,949
It's okay.

1150
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:33,819
I forgive you.

1151
00:52:34,075 --> 00:52:34,953
Seriously?

1152
00:52:35,076 --> 00:52:36,080
That's what friends do!

1153
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:38,991
Amigos!

1154
00:52:39,982 --> 00:52:40,860
Don't worry!

1155
00:52:40,984 --> 00:52:43,865
We're gonna have plenty of time
for guys chat.

1156
00:52:43,953 --> 00:52:44,957
Once we get back to Russia.

1157
00:52:45,088 --> 00:52:46,058
Huh? Russia?

1158
00:52:46,156 --> 00:52:48,832
Oh, sure!
Oh, you're gonna love it there.

1159
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,999
All the snow and the ice.

1160
00:52:53,064 --> 00:52:55,103
You're gonna love the way
it pierces your skin.

1161
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,078
And makes your...

1162
00:52:57,102 --> 00:52:59,846
Oh, I get excited just to think about it.

1163
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:02,011
Plus, it's only 5,000 miles away.

1164
00:53:02,143 --> 00:53:03,954
So you can visit home every year or two.

1165
00:53:04,077 --> 00:53:04,978
Or three.

1166
00:53:05,078 --> 00:53:06,048
Maybe four.

1167
00:53:07,181 --> 00:53:08,890
You're gonna be a polar bear.

1168
00:53:09,016 --> 00:53:09,894
That's what you're gonna be.

1169
00:53:10,017 --> 00:53:11,089
Let's go, troops!

1170
00:53:11,186 --> 00:53:12,064
Look alive!

1171
00:53:13,188 --> 00:53:15,068
Uncle Boog never took us
on a rescue mission.

1172
00:53:15,191 --> 00:53:16,934
Yeah, I know.

1173
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,964
This is way cool!

1174
00:53:19,097 --> 00:53:21,068
You should go out of town
more often, mother.

1175
00:53:21,165 --> 00:53:23,011
Elvis, I don't think so.

1176
00:53:24,235 --> 00:53:26,115
Release the emergency break.

1177
00:53:27,239 --> 00:53:28,117
We are moving!

1178
00:53:29,075 --> 00:53:30,955
Hang on to your little horses.

1179
00:53:31,143 --> 00:53:33,080
Steady. Steady.

1180
00:53:33,213 --> 00:53:35,115
Alright everyone, steady.

1181
00:53:35,215 --> 00:53:37,095
I can't see a thing!

1182
00:53:39,019 --> 00:53:41,866
- Why?
- Out of the way! Out of the way!

1183
00:53:46,195 --> 00:53:48,132
Steady. Steady.

1184
00:53:50,033 --> 00:53:51,105
Oh no! Oh no!

1185
00:53:51,234 --> 00:53:53,045
- They're gone! They're gone!
- What's gone?

1186
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:54,845
- Turn left, right?
- Right!

1187
00:53:54,938 --> 00:53:56,875
No! Nine! I said left!

1188
00:54:10,024 --> 00:54:10,902
No! No!

1189
00:54:11,225 --> 00:54:13,136
No!

1190
00:54:13,994 --> 00:54:16,099
Oh.

1191
00:54:18,066 --> 00:54:19,070
I'm calling it a day.

1192
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,064
It's worse than I thought.

1193
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:43,131
They strap him to wheels
and light him on fire.

1194
00:54:43,263 --> 00:54:44,141
Then point and laugh!

1195
00:54:44,231 --> 00:54:45,940
It's torture at its worst!

1196
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:47,003
We have to rescue Boog before.

1197
00:54:47,134 --> 00:54:49,071
They make him wind into tiny,
whiny rope of death!

1198
00:54:50,037 --> 00:54:50,915
Let's go!

1199
00:54:51,138 --> 00:54:51,946
Yeah!

1200
00:54:51,974 --> 00:54:52,145
Wait!

1201
00:54:53,008 --> 00:54:54,012
Their fortress is inpenetrable.

1202
00:54:56,245 --> 00:54:57,146
it's hard to break into.

1203
00:54:57,246 --> 00:54:58,989
So here's what we're gonna do.

1204
00:54:59,248 --> 00:55:01,924
McSquizzy and Buddy,
you work on the left flank.

1205
00:55:02,019 --> 00:55:04,024
Kids, you run the charging manoeuver
on the right.

1206
00:55:04,154 --> 00:55:06,091
Ian, Giselle,
you find a chisel, a toothbrush.

1207
00:55:06,191 --> 00:55:07,968
And as many maracas as you can carry.

1208
00:55:08,091 --> 00:55:10,164
- Then.
- Or. What about this instead?

1209
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:12,869
Serge and Danny, you find the exits.

1210
00:55:12,964 --> 00:55:14,935
Mom and Ian, you stay
and look out here and here.

1211
00:55:15,067 --> 00:55:16,844
While the rest of us sneak in here.

1212
00:55:16,969 --> 00:55:17,870
And rescue Boog.

1213
00:55:18,104 --> 00:55:19,082
Yeah!

1214
00:55:20,173 --> 00:55:21,051
That's ridiculous!

1215
00:55:21,174 --> 00:55:22,075
The tent's too big.

1216
00:55:22,176 --> 00:55:24,022
We need at least 6 more of us.

1217
00:55:24,145 --> 00:55:25,023
To pull that off.

1218
00:55:38,194 --> 00:55:39,903
Oh, my friends!

1219
00:55:40,231 --> 00:55:41,109
Mr. Weenie?

1220
00:55:41,232 --> 00:55:42,941
What are you guys doing here?

1221
00:55:43,035 --> 00:55:44,937
We are here to safe Boog!

1222
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,041
- Kick some pals!
- So are we!

1223
00:55:47,974 --> 00:55:49,080
It's destiny.

1224
00:55:50,109 --> 00:55:51,113
Ladies and gentlemen!

1225
00:55:51,211 --> 00:55:53,057
I'd like to welcome you

1226
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:56,926
To the great Moslova Family Circus!

1227
00:56:03,157 --> 00:56:04,866
Everyone clear about what to do?

1228
00:56:04,994 --> 00:56:05,964
- Yes!
- No problem.

1229
00:56:06,062 --> 00:56:07,134
Uh, what was the middle part again?

1230
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:08,141
Dad ....

1231
00:56:08,265 --> 00:56:10,076
Everyone spread out and try to find Boog.

1232
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,101
When you see him.

1233
00:56:11,234 --> 00:56:14,013
- Go get him.
- Alright, let's move it out.

1234
00:56:14,105 --> 00:56:17,077
- Be careful, girls.
- Okay, mom.

1235
00:56:22,114 --> 00:56:24,051
So. Come here often?

1236
00:56:24,149 --> 00:56:25,050
Don't even think about it.

1237
00:56:30,992 --> 00:56:32,030
Stop acting like such a troop.

1238
00:56:36,097 --> 00:56:37,101
I really missed you guys.

1239
00:56:37,198 --> 00:56:38,873
Yeah, me too.

1240
00:56:39,001 --> 00:56:40,175
A full house! This is fantastic!

1241
00:56:42,004 --> 00:56:44,976
- Are Ursa and Boog ready to go?
- They're ready.

1242
00:56:47,077 --> 00:56:48,055
Boog.

1243
00:56:48,078 --> 00:56:48,979
Where did the rest go?

1244
00:56:51,048 --> 00:56:54,122
You! You must be the new recruits!

1245
00:56:54,217 --> 00:56:55,926
Yeah, yeah.

1246
00:56:56,022 --> 00:56:56,957
That's what we are.

1247
00:57:01,128 --> 00:57:02,098
Come on, let's go.

1248
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:24,055
- Any sign of Boog?
- No, I can't see him from here.

1249
00:57:24,188 --> 00:57:25,158
We need to get to higher ground.

1250
00:57:25,257 --> 00:57:26,135
Like that.

1251
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:30,938
Man, I can't wait to get back
and see Alistair.

1252
00:57:31,162 --> 00:57:32,166
Back to my own cart.

1253
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:34,934
Home cooking. Three meals a day.

1254
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,176
I don't know, Bob.
This expo is a bust.

1255
00:57:38,272 --> 00:57:40,118
When we head back to the air stream.

1256
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:43,045
Did you hear that?

1257
00:57:43,244 --> 00:57:44,885
He's close by.

1258
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:46,016
I can smell him.

1259
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:49,929
Let me try the bathing call.

1260
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:00,075
Big Foot!

1261
00:58:21,023 --> 00:58:22,027
Ladies and gentlemen.

1262
00:58:22,224 --> 00:58:25,901
The miraculous balancing...

1263
00:58:29,266 --> 00:58:31,112
Stanley! Do you see him?

1264
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:32,978
I'm not seeing him.

1265
00:58:33,171 --> 00:58:35,051
Please. Welcome.

1266
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,020
The juggling pugs.

1267
00:58:37,243 --> 00:58:39,054
Fifi! Do you see him?

1268
00:58:44,183 --> 00:58:45,061
Great!

1269
00:58:46,186 --> 00:58:47,164
Boog!

1270
00:58:48,254 --> 00:58:49,132
Come on.

1271
00:58:49,257 --> 00:58:50,966
Let's find a different spot.

1272
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:54,030
You'd think we can't miss
a 1,200 pound fat bear!

1273
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:55,164
Ursa!

1274
00:58:55,997 --> 00:58:58,138
- Wait!
- Come on, Boog! Show them what you got.

1275
00:59:01,136 --> 00:59:02,174
I can't see a thing from back here.

1276
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:04,014
Any sign of Boog?

1277
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:06,053
Ursa!

1278
00:59:06,076 --> 00:59:07,114
You're doing great, Boog.

1279
00:59:08,112 --> 00:59:09,150
Oh, you see him? Good!

1280
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,158
Let's get him!

1281
00:59:14,252 --> 00:59:16,132
Mika! You have returned!

1282
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:19,094
Time to go back into space.

1283
00:59:19,192 --> 00:59:20,162
It's dark in here!

1284
00:59:20,292 --> 00:59:21,170
Let me out!

1285
00:59:21,294 --> 00:59:23,105
I'm coming, Buddy!

1286
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:43,999
Mr. Weenie!

1287
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,932
Look, Bob, proof aliens do exist!

1288
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:50,002
- Keep up, handsome.
- Ursa!

1289
00:59:51,096 --> 00:59:52,066
Where are you, uncle Boog?

1290
01:00:10,053 --> 01:00:10,931
Hi Fifi!

1291
01:00:11,054 --> 01:00:12,124
Ursa!

1292
01:00:13,256 --> 01:00:15,033
- Pretty!
- Oh no!

1293
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:33,083
I hate dogs.

1294
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,092
Uncle Boog!

1295
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:40,000
Tell dad he's right there!

1296
01:00:42,057 --> 01:00:43,035
Ursa!

1297
01:00:43,058 --> 01:00:44,062
- Ursa!
- Boog!

1298
01:00:44,194 --> 01:00:45,129
What are you doing?

1299
01:00:45,228 --> 01:00:46,937
You need to get to your place.

1300
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:48,169
I need to talk to you about Russia.

1301
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:50,041
It's so far away and.

1302
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:52,138
- I'm not sure if I...
- Boog, we need to focus here.

1303
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:54,047
It's almost time for the big lift!

1304
01:00:54,172 --> 01:00:56,018
- I know, but...
- Come on, Doug!

1305
01:00:56,108 --> 01:00:57,988
Please don't make this difficult.

1306
01:00:59,044 --> 01:01:00,022
Dad!

1307
01:01:00,045 --> 01:01:01,023
Dad!

1308
01:01:01,147 --> 01:01:02,125
Dad!

1309
01:01:06,220 --> 01:01:07,098
Gesalital

1310
01:01:07,221 --> 01:01:09,067
Uncle Boog is right there!

1311
01:01:09,190 --> 01:01:10,160
What are you saying? Right? Left?

1312
01:01:10,291 --> 01:01:11,169
Left? Rig ht? Left?

1313
01:01:12,327 --> 01:01:13,305
Boog!

1314
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:15,008
Elliot!

1315
01:01:15,230 --> 01:01:16,973
Wait, what are you doing here?

1316
01:01:17,065 --> 01:01:18,967
Thank goodness, I found you!

1317
01:01:19,101 --> 01:01:20,139
We're here to rescue you.

1318
01:01:21,237 --> 01:01:23,083
Elliot, I can't go!

1319
01:01:23,173 --> 01:01:24,143
Doug! Pay attention!

1320
01:01:25,175 --> 01:01:26,053
Ready?

1321
01:01:26,177 --> 01:01:27,055
Go, Doug, go!

1322
01:01:27,211 --> 01:01:28,189
Boog!

1323
01:01:28,212 --> 01:01:30,114
It's worse than I thought.

1324
01:01:30,248 --> 01:01:32,025
He's been brain washed.

1325
01:01:32,117 --> 01:01:34,088
And now, Ursa.

1326
01:01:34,219 --> 01:01:36,224
The great bear in disguise.

1327
01:01:36,322 --> 01:01:39,169
Featuring the flying nano plates.

1328
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:57,224
Boog.

1329
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:59,058
Are you sure you can do this?

1330
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:00,153
I don't know.

1331
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:02,130
Russia's a big step and.

1332
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:04,191
No, I mean the lift.

1333
01:02:05,157 --> 01:02:07,094
I've never been able to do it before and...

1334
01:02:07,226 --> 01:02:10,164
if you are not 100 percent
sure you can do it.

1335
01:02:13,099 --> 01:02:13,977
I'll be ready.

1336
01:02:21,343 --> 01:02:22,221
Plan B.

1337
01:02:22,344 --> 01:02:25,123
Smash and grab.
Smash everything and grab Boog.

1338
01:02:28,184 --> 01:02:31,031
Don't bother with me.
Just another circus dancer.

1339
01:02:40,231 --> 01:02:41,109
You ready?

1340
01:02:41,233 --> 01:02:42,168
Come on, Ursa!

1341
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,178
Go for it!

1342
01:02:43,302 --> 01:02:44,180
I got you!

1343
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:45,281
Boog!

1344
01:02:45,271 --> 01:02:47,151
Okay guys, smash and grab!

1345
01:03:00,156 --> 01:03:01,034
Please hold me.

1346
01:03:13,238 --> 01:03:14,116
He did it!

1347
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,021
Oh, she finally did it.

1348
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:21,091
You got me.

1349
01:03:24,084 --> 01:03:25,062
Boog!

1350
01:03:25,085 --> 01:03:26,225
- Uncle Boog!
- You're safe! We're here to save you!

1351
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,097
Rescue accomplished!

1352
01:03:28,189 --> 01:03:29,190
Yes!

1353
01:03:29,224 --> 01:03:30,102
What are you all doing here?

1354
01:03:30,225 --> 01:03:32,230
Come on, let's get moving
before your captors return.

1355
01:03:33,362 --> 01:03:35,037
Hold up, Elliot!

1356
01:03:35,131 --> 01:03:37,102
I appreciate you all trying
to rescue me, but...

1357
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:38,170
I need to talk to Ursa.

1358
01:03:38,302 --> 01:03:39,280
Ursa?

1359
01:03:39,303 --> 01:03:40,204
Who's Ursa?

1360
01:03:40,337 --> 01:03:41,315
I am.

1361
01:03:46,277 --> 01:03:48,054
So. What?

1362
01:03:48,179 --> 01:03:50,252
She like your new best
friend or something?

1363
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:52,058
No, I am.

1364
01:03:52,318 --> 01:03:53,296
What?

1365
01:03:57,257 --> 01:03:59,137
You have 2 new best friends?

1366
01:04:00,326 --> 01:04:03,036
I canceled one guys trip
and the next thing I know.

1367
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,009
I've been replaced.

1368
01:04:04,265 --> 01:04:05,143
Twice.

1369
01:04:05,266 --> 01:04:07,043
Elliot, buddy.

1370
01:04:07,168 --> 01:04:08,046
I'm sorry.

1371
01:04:09,071 --> 01:04:10,075
You haven't been replaced.

1372
01:04:10,339 --> 01:04:12,116
You'll always be my BFF.

1373
01:04:12,242 --> 01:04:14,144
Are you apologizing?

1374
01:04:14,244 --> 01:04:15,222
Yeah.

1375
01:04:15,246 --> 01:04:17,251
I forgive you.

1376
01:04:18,115 --> 01:04:19,255
But only because you forgave me first.

1377
01:04:19,349 --> 01:04:22,059
Now, let's ditch the goat
and the babe and hit the road!

1378
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:24,159
I am not a goat!

1379
01:04:25,091 --> 01:04:26,095
I am a Lama.

1380
01:04:26,225 --> 01:04:29,072
Really? 'Cos you look more like an
Argentinian Carnelian.

1381
01:04:32,098 --> 01:04:32,976
And now.

1382
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:34,206
Ladies and gentlemen.

1383
01:04:34,335 --> 01:04:38,115
The musical scaling of Alistair!

1384
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:45,115
Come on, Boog.

1385
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,184
- Without me?
- No.

1386
01:04:46,316 --> 01:04:47,217
We gotta get out of here.

1387
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:49,127
- Elliot, Alistair.
- Do it!

1388
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,153
- Guys..
- Come on.

1389
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:52,031
Hold on, come on you guys.

1390
01:04:54,325 --> 01:04:56,205
- I'm not letting go:
- Alisa

1391
01:04:56,360 --> 01:04:57,338
Stop!

1392
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,134
Everybody just hold up!

1393
01:05:00,232 --> 01:05:01,210
Ursa.

1394
01:05:01,366 --> 01:05:03,974
My beautiful Russian bear.

1395
01:05:05,171 --> 01:05:07,142
I came here looking
for a place where I belong.

1396
01:05:08,242 --> 01:05:10,088
But what I found was so much more.

1397
01:05:11,112 --> 01:05:11,990
What I found.

1398
01:05:12,346 --> 01:05:13,224
Was you.

1399
01:05:15,150 --> 01:05:16,028
Oh, Boog.

1400
01:05:16,318 --> 01:05:17,253
Come with me.

1401
01:05:18,353 --> 01:05:21,132
Come to the forest, make me the
happiest bear on earth.

1402
01:05:24,161 --> 01:05:25,096
Oh, Boog.

1403
01:05:26,195 --> 01:05:27,165
I really want to.

1404
01:05:29,100 --> 01:05:29,978
But I can't.

1405
01:05:32,204 --> 01:05:33,981
A Russian circus without a bear is like...

1406
01:05:34,106 --> 01:05:35,212
no circus at all.

1407
01:05:36,343 --> 01:05:38,086
I could never do that to them.

1408
01:05:39,212 --> 01:05:40,147
You should go.

1409
01:05:41,348 --> 01:05:44,092
I can see that they are more
than just your friends.

1410
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:46,027
They are your family.

1411
01:05:48,156 --> 01:05:50,036
And family should always stick together.

1412
01:05:50,359 --> 01:05:51,337
Come.

1413
01:05:53,128 --> 01:05:55,008
I will help you move the carts.

1414
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:58,078
Boog.

1415
01:05:58,102 --> 01:05:59,072
You should stay.

1416
01:05:59,170 --> 01:06:01,016
I learn something too!

1417
01:06:01,104 --> 01:06:03,211
That friends want each other to be happy.

1418
01:06:03,307 --> 01:06:05,187
So if she makes you happy.

1419
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:07,018
Then you should be with her.

1420
01:06:07,145 --> 01:06:08,023
Elliot.

1421
01:06:09,114 --> 01:06:10,084
That was really nice.

1422
01:06:11,084 --> 01:06:12,054
You're awesome, dad.

1423
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:13,163
Yeah!

1424
01:06:13,185 --> 01:06:14,155
I know.

1425
01:06:19,126 --> 01:06:20,198
These are tears of joy!

1426
01:06:22,262 --> 01:06:24,142
So beautiful!

1427
01:06:24,265 --> 01:06:25,143
Alistair!

1428
01:06:27,336 --> 01:06:29,113
You came back for me?

1429
01:06:29,305 --> 01:06:32,049
Oh, buddy! I'm glad to see you!

1430
01:06:32,142 --> 01:06:34,079
Oh, it's good to see you too!

1431
01:06:34,177 --> 01:06:35,249
I'd like to breathe.

1432
01:06:35,378 --> 01:06:37,155
Sorry, I tricked you, Boog.

1433
01:06:37,248 --> 01:06:40,095
Sometimes you don't know
what you have until you've lost it.

1434
01:06:41,153 --> 01:06:42,225
I know exactly what you mean.

1435
01:06:42,387 --> 01:06:44,198
- Ursa.
- Doug.

1436
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,170
Come on! We're late for our show!

1437
01:06:51,332 --> 01:06:52,210
And now!

1438
01:06:52,333 --> 01:06:54,110
Ladies and gentlemen.

1439
01:06:54,202 --> 01:06:57,015
The duet you've been waiting for.

1440
01:07:02,111 --> 01:07:03,149
Looks like the circus has a bear.

1441
01:07:04,113 --> 01:07:05,185
Looks like you do too.

1442
01:07:07,284 --> 01:07:08,219
What are we waiting for?

1443
01:07:08,352 --> 01:07:09,230
Let's go!

1444
01:07:11,156 --> 01:07:12,091
Let them go.

1445
01:07:12,223 --> 01:07:13,227
But the circus!

1446
01:07:13,324 --> 01:07:14,999
The circus.

1447
01:07:15,093 --> 01:07:16,063
Will be fine.

1448
01:07:18,230 --> 01:07:19,268
Or try to work to Rome.

1449
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,213
A place that we call home.

1450
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:30,079
You sure you're cool with this?

1451
01:07:30,210 --> 01:07:31,145
Absolutely!

1452
01:07:31,245 --> 01:07:33,216
It's important to make time
for your friends.

1453
01:07:33,314 --> 01:07:35,160
Even when you have a babe around.

1454
01:07:35,284 --> 01:07:36,185
Oh yeah!

1455
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:37,220
Punch it in, baby bear.

1456
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:45,164
Dinkleman, I didn't know
you were a girl!

1457
01:07:46,163 --> 01:07:47,098
Have fun, Elliot!

1458
01:07:47,398 --> 01:07:50,074
And don't forget
to keep an eye on Elvis.

1459
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:51,273
Let's get move on!

1460
01:07:51,368 --> 01:07:54,044
Guys trip waits for no deer!

1461
01:07:54,173 --> 01:07:55,051
Or bug.

1462
01:07:55,174 --> 01:07:56,178
That's right, son.

1463
01:07:56,310 --> 01:07:59,282
You're old enough to take part
in the sacred tradition that is...

1464
01:07:59,379 --> 01:08:01,156
guys trip.

1465
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,993
# On the road again #

1466
01:08:05,287 --> 01:08:08,168
#Just can't wait
to get on the road again #

1467
01:08:09,391 --> 01:08:13,171
# I've always loved making
music with my friends #

1468
01:08:13,296 --> 01:08:16,177
#And I can't wait
to get on the road again #

1469
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:18,178
He's not coming?

1470
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:20,078
He's gonna join us later.

1471
01:08:22,174 --> 01:08:24,145
Maybe we'll get some answers, Bob.

1472
01:08:24,242 --> 01:08:27,123
Like if Mr. Weenie was probed or not.

1473
01:08:28,313 --> 01:08:30,193
# On the road again #

1474
01:08:31,384 --> 01:08:34,128
# Going places that I've never been #

1475
01:08:36,157 --> 01:08:39,038
# Seeing things
that I may never see again #

1476
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:42,133
#I can't wait
to get on the road again #

1477
01:08:45,367 --> 01:08:46,245
Hey Alistair.

1478
01:08:47,136 --> 01:08:48,242
Aren't you glad
to be going back to Russia?

1479
01:08:48,371 --> 01:08:50,251
Oh, truth said it, amigo.

1480
01:08:51,274 --> 01:08:53,154
I hope I get to see my girlfriend.

1481
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:56,021
Carmen I'm coming for you!

1482
01:08:57,114 --> 01:08:58,118
# On the road again #

1483
01:08:58,349 --> 01:09:02,095
# Like a band of gypsies
we go down the highway #

1484
01:09:03,154 --> 01:09:05,056
#With the best friends #

1485
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:08,264
# it's now the world keeps
turning our way #

1486
01:09:09,430 --> 01:09:11,139
#In Norway#

1487
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:13,237
What is it?

1488
01:09:13,368 --> 01:09:17,307
It's just a little something
we set up for you.

1489
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:19,244
This is so sweet.

1490
01:09:19,341 --> 01:09:22,051
Thank you for making me feel welcome.

1491
01:09:24,214 --> 01:09:25,286
Alright, ladies. Look alive!

1492
01:09:27,284 --> 01:09:28,219
Oh, brother.

1493
01:09:32,390 --> 01:09:34,099
Oh, arrest me, officer.

1494
01:09:34,192 --> 01:09:36,231
- Got it.
- Shake it, shake it.

1495
01:09:36,361 --> 01:09:39,071
To the right. Two three four.

1496
01:09:42,336 --> 01:09:45,240
Who's up for the rabbit fight!

1497
01:09:51,213 --> 01:09:52,191
Yeah.

1498
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:30,193
Look out, baby.

1499
01:10:42,241 --> 01:10:43,211
Guys trip!

1500
01:10:49,415 --> 01:10:52,057
It doesn't getting any better than this.

1501
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:54,099
